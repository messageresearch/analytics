[49:30] only hear that which the spirit wants to
[49:32] be heard so Lord we just Commit This
[49:34] Time to you now in Jesus name amen if
[49:37] you have your Bibles and you already
[49:38] turned there Revelations 3 and verse1 14
[49:40] and it says unto the angel of the Church
[49:43] of the leod Deans right that's to us yes
[49:47] come on now each and every one of us
[49:49] here tonight should be able to identify
[49:51] with this passage these things sayith
[49:53] the amen the faithful and the true
[49:56] witness the beginning of the creation of
[49:58] God I Know Thy works so God knows your
[50:03] works and let me just say it like this
[50:05] and God knows when you don't
[50:08] work all right there's one thing to be
[50:10] knowing I'm doing something for God
[50:11] there another thing to be dilatory and
[50:13] lazy God knows thy works that thou are
[50:16] neither cold nor hot I would that thou
[50:18] were cold or hot so then because Thou
[50:21] Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[50:25] will spew thee out of my mouth because
[50:27] thou sayth I am rich I am increased with
[50:30] Goods I have need of nothing and knowest
[50:33] not that thou art wretched miserable
[50:36] poor blind and naked this is God's
[50:40] description of that
[50:43] person I counsel thee to buy me gold
[50:46] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[50:48] rich and white rayment thou mayest be
[50:50] clothed and th the shame of thy
[50:52] nakedness do not appear and anoint thy
[50:54] eyes with eyes sand that thou mayest see
[50:57] as many as I love I rebuke and I chasen
[51:00] be zealous therefore and
[51:01] repent behold I stand at the door and
[51:04] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[51:08] open the door I will come into him and I
[51:10] will s with him and he with me to him
[51:13] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[51:15] me in my throne even as I have overcome
[51:19] and I sat down with my father in his
[51:21] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[51:24] what the spirit sayith unto the churches
[51:27] God bless you you can have your seats
[51:29] tonight I'm going to go ahead and start
[51:31] my timer so that I'm on time
[51:33] tonight last night we spoke about
[51:36] silence the voice of your enemy but
[51:39] tonight I want to speak to you on listen
[51:42] to The Voice all right not I noticed I
[51:46] didn't say listen to a voice listen to
[51:49] The Voice so we know there's many voices
[51:51] in the land today and we spoke about
[51:53] some of those last night but we want
[51:55] want to be careful that we listen to The
[51:57] Voice let he that hath ear hear what the
[52:00] spirit say to the churches and we find
[52:04] in John 10 verse 27 my keep hear my
[52:09] voice notice that word hear there means
[52:11] to attend to or to consider what is
[52:14] being said or it means to understand it
[52:17] means to perceive the sense of what is
[52:20] being said so we find that sheep hear a
[52:23] lot of voices how many you ever been
[52:24] around sheep bad bad B all them B I mean
[52:28] there's a lot of Racket going on but the
[52:31] Sheep know the voice of the shepherd see
[52:34] they they only hear they only understand
[52:37] they only perceive the voice of the
[52:39] shepherd and and we notice and not only
[52:41] that but the shepherd knows each and
[52:44] every one of his sheep so it's one thing
[52:47] for you to come to the house of God and
[52:49] say I know God but it's another thing
[52:51] for the shepherd almighty God to come
[52:53] down and say I know my sheep I know
[52:57] their voice I know their call I know
[52:59] their situation and understanding
[53:02] tonight church that why would a great
[53:04] Shepherd leave 90 and9 and go to that
[53:06] one lost sheep because that sheep is
[53:09] known other Shepherd he's acquainted
[53:11] with the shepherd the shepherd has
[53:13] raised that sheep the shepherd has
[53:15] looked over that sheep the shepherd has
[53:17] fed that sheep and that's why he's
[53:19] willing to leave is because he got
[53:21] investment into that sheep and God's got
[53:23] investments into you tonight he will
[53:26] leave this church and go out in Elk
[53:28] Kentucky and find that little lamb after
[53:31] braiding and needing of of a saer
[53:33] redeemer he's still going after lost
[53:37] sheep my my my sheep they hear my
[53:41] voice notice they hear a lot of voices
[53:45] come
[53:45] on but they only truly hear the voice of
[53:50] the shepherd that's it that's right see
[53:53] their safety brother Thomas doesn't
[53:55] consist in knowing all the other voices
[53:58] but their safety consist in knowing that
[54:00] all the other voices are not the voice
[54:03] of the shepherd that's why we have to
[54:05] rightly divide the word of God that's
[54:09] why when you come into the house of God
[54:10] and somebody stands behind this pull pit
[54:12] and you can tell if you're a true
[54:15] sheep you can tell if you're a true
[54:18] sheep of what the shepherd is speaking
[54:20] is that the voice of the shepherd or is
[54:23] that the man's voice is he trying to
[54:25] feed you his own idea is he trying to
[54:27] feed you his own Doctrine because the
[54:29] shepherd is going to stay with the
[54:32] word and my sheep will hear my
[54:35] voice see the rest of the voices are
[54:38] strangers but the voice of the shepherd
[54:41] is a Voice of Truth it's a voice of
[54:43] protection it's a voice of safety it's
[54:46] the voice of
[54:48] Life what we find here in John 10 he
[54:51] says my sheep hear my voice but that's
[54:54] not all all he says and I know
[54:59] them the word know here means to be
[55:02] acquainted with to have knowledge of and
[55:04] I spoke about it last night you were in
[55:06] the back part of God's mind God knows
[55:10] you God knew you before the foundation
[55:13] of the world you were a thought in the
[55:15] back part of God's mind so the shepherd
[55:18] knows his sheep God knows who is his and
[55:22] God knows who is not his and that's why
[55:24] I'm telling you tonight it's one thing
[55:26] that you can say I know God or I know a
[55:29] prophet and I know a message but what
[55:31] about God knowing you tonight what about
[55:33] God being acquainted with you tonight
[55:35] what about God saying quit listen to all
[55:37] the other voices and listen to my voice
[55:41] tonight some of you been listening to
[55:43] the voice of Hollywood and the voice of
[55:45] school and the voice of of this ball
[55:47] star and the voice of this game and the
[55:49] voice of this influence but what about
[55:51] the voice that'll transform your body
[55:54] what about the voice that would change
[55:56] dimensions that's the voice that we need
[55:58] to be listening to
[56:02] tonight yes thank you Lord Jes brother
[56:05] Brown tells us then hear ye him he said
[56:07] the Bible is the very thoughts of God
[56:10] that God had before the foundation of
[56:12] the world expressed them in word Dro
[56:15] them down to prophets yes and they wrote
[56:19] them yeah notice he says now that's the
[56:22] only thing it just has to unfold God
[56:25] knows all things and by the spirit of
[56:27] knowledge why God drops it to His
[56:29] prophets as Eagles who sail up in the
[56:32] air and they see things happen before it
[56:34] gets there he says you see he says so
[56:36] God has always had an ordained
[56:39] way like it or lump it God has called
[56:42] man to preach the gospel you may not
[56:45] like his shape you may not like his size
[56:48] you may not like his delivery you may
[56:50] not like his breath I don't care what it
[56:52] is but God has called man to preach the
[56:55] gospel he could have chose anything but
[56:57] God chose man and man's not perfect
[57:00] man's got flaws man's got mistakes man's
[57:03] got vales but yet God is still called
[57:06] man to declare the word of
[57:08] God and the sheep can hear the voice of
[57:11] God through the
[57:13] man I want you to understand that they
[57:16] look Beyond The Vessel they look Beyond
[57:18] the Veil and they hear the voice of God
[57:22] is that the word is that Theus say of
[57:24] the Lord is that in line with the truth
[57:26] does that match up from Paul's day to
[57:28] our day and if it does that's not the
[57:30] voice of a man that's the voice of God
[57:32] to the
[57:35] people I don't need to get ahead of
[57:37] myself cuz well I can right now but I'm
[57:39] G try to slow down notice
[57:42] now we find here that God has always
[57:46] worked through
[57:48] man we find in second Peter 1:2 knowing
[57:51] this first that no prophecy is of of the
[57:54] scripture of any private interpretation
[57:57] for the prophecy came not in the old
[58:00] time by the will of man but the holy but
[58:04] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[58:07] by the Holy Ghost see I'm not here this
[58:10] evening to speak in my own word but last
[58:13] week when I was alone and I was in
[58:15] prayer for the services God spoke to me
[58:17] and said I need you to preach two
[58:19] Services silence the voice of the enemy
[58:23] and listen to The Voice Voice come on
[58:25] that's right I said well I hadn't
[58:27] preached those thoughts in forever but
[58:30] you know what with God the word is
[58:32] eternal so God knows tonight God knows
[58:35] this weekend it was already pre-planned
[58:37] before brother Thomas and I ever made
[58:39] the arrangements God already
[58:41] predestinated the service he
[58:43] predestinated you to be here he knew the
[58:45] seat that you would be on he knew the
[58:47] attitude in which you would come in and
[58:49] God is declaring if you can put all that
[58:51] aside tonight and hear the voice God has
[58:53] got something special for
[58:57] you so notice he says he that hath an
[59:00] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[59:03] unto the churches he said it may be that
[59:05] Millions will hear these words or read
[59:07] them but how many will pay heed to
[59:11] them he said that we do not know but he
[59:14] will lend his ear but he who will lend
[59:17] his ear and want to know the words of
[59:19] truth we'll find the spirit of God
[59:22] enlightening him if you're ear is open
[59:25] to the word the spirit of God will make
[59:28] the word real to
[59:31] you if your ear is open to hear to
[59:36] perceive to earnestly God what do you
[59:39] have for me tonight come on he says then
[59:43] the word will be revealed to you see now
[59:47] he says that is the work of the spirit
[59:49] he goes I can teach you the truth but if
[59:51] you don't open your ear to hear it and
[59:53] your heart to receive it
[59:55] you won't get the Revelation and we
[59:58] spoke about Revelation last night and
[1:00:00] Revelation is the most important thing
[1:00:02] that we as Believers can receive come on
[1:00:05] so he talks about the first age and
[1:00:07] brother BR said notice we understand
[1:00:09] that the Ephesian age was a first age
[1:00:11] ordained by Paul or yeah excuse me Paul
[1:00:14] and Paul established a church and he
[1:00:16] wrote the majority of the New Testament
[1:00:18] but he says now how tragic is it that
[1:00:20] the first age did not listen to the
[1:00:23] spirit this is in the Ephesian Church
[1:00:25] age instead it listened to
[1:00:28] man
[1:00:30] yeah all right but thank God in the last
[1:00:33] AG there will be a group rise up the
[1:00:36] true Bride of the last day and she will
[1:00:38] listen to the spirit in that day of
[1:00:41] gross Darkness the light will return by
[1:00:43] the pure word and we will return to the
[1:00:46] power of Pentecost to welcome back the
[1:00:49] Lord Jesus Christ think about it here
[1:00:52] they are great Paul's Ministry he
[1:00:54] established a church the greatest
[1:00:56] Prophet that maybe outside of William
[1:00:58] Bramley hit the face of the Earth and
[1:01:00] God so entrusted in him to establish the
[1:01:03] church and a mere 30 years after his
[1:01:06] departure the men of God that followed
[1:01:08] that Ministry begin to listen to the
[1:01:11] voice of a man and it got away from the
[1:01:13] voice of God and it brought them down
[1:01:15] through destruction and we find that the
[1:01:17] Ephesian age was an age that was aimed
[1:01:20] at the things of God but they got
[1:01:21] relaxed on the word of God they got Dory
[1:01:24] on the word of God and if we're not
[1:01:26] careful L to see we'll be the same thing
[1:01:28] oh I believe God in a prophet oh I
[1:01:30] believe the mess hour but yet you got
[1:01:32] things that are taking your attention
[1:01:35] away from the word and you got relaxed
[1:01:37] on the things of God and God is calling
[1:01:39] us back come back to The Voice come back
[1:01:42] to my word hear the spirit of God hear
[1:01:44] the voice for this
[1:01:49] hour Lord 30
[1:01:52] years after Paul Ministry we're some 60
[1:01:56] years after Brother
[1:01:58] brandom's come on now 30 years they
[1:02:01] begin to drift
[1:02:02] away from that
[1:02:06] reality from that
[1:02:10] voice and where are some people sitting
[1:02:12] today 60 years 60 years and we wonder
[1:02:18] why we can't keep our young people in
[1:02:20] church we wonder why some of our young
[1:02:22] people go off into the world yeah why
[1:02:26] because where's the
[1:02:27] voice where's The Voice have we
[1:02:30] substituted the voice of a prophet for
[1:02:32] the voice of a man's
[1:02:34] idea or when we make compromise and we
[1:02:37] get dilatory we do this and we do that
[1:02:39] because we're just trying to keep the
[1:02:40] home in the right atmosphere this word
[1:02:43] will keep the home in the right
[1:02:44] atmosphere you just stick with the word
[1:02:46] of God the word still works Church you
[1:02:50] apply the token to your family you apply
[1:02:52] the token to your home you apply the
[1:02:54] token to your children and the token
[1:02:56] will do exactly what the token was
[1:02:58] designed to
[1:03:00] do you don't have to compromise we don't
[1:03:02] need Dr Dawson we don't need Psychology
[1:03:05] we got the word of God for this hour we
[1:03:08] got the voice of the Angel
[1:03:10] here you find men of God they substitute
[1:03:13] and they got psychology now and look let
[1:03:16] me tell you psychology ain't never saved
[1:03:20] nobody men who came in on psychology it
[1:03:22] may have held them 15 years 20 years but
[1:03:25] eventually they go right back out but

[1:03:29] somebody that met God on the backside of
[1:03:31] a desert somebody that had a Pentecostal

[1:07:54] savior I'll listen to the
[1:07:57] voice of my redeemer I listen to the
[1:08:00] voice of the Holy Ghost filler tonight
[1:08:02] that's the voice I'm listening
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:06] to notice that he says his
[1:08:10] word is in the bride as it was in Mary
[1:08:14] the bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:08:16] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:08:19] she performs the command of the word in
[1:08:22] his name for
[1:08:24] she has dust sayith the Lord then the
[1:08:28] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[1:08:30] comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:08:32] planted in water it comes to full
[1:08:34] Harvest serving its purpose see the word
[1:08:37] is in the
[1:08:39] bride now I just want to understand this
[1:08:42] that it's not this Bible in the bride
[1:08:45] it's not the letter that's in the bride
[1:08:47] but in the beginning was the word the
[1:08:49] word there means a logos so the logos
[1:08:53] all all that God was he poured it into
[1:08:56] Christ and all that Christ was he pours
[1:08:59] it into his bride so what am I telling
[1:09:01] you I'm telling you tonight that Christ
[1:09:04] is in his bride his life is in his bride
[1:09:06] his authority is in his bride his power
[1:09:09] is in his bride the miraculous is in his
[1:09:11] bride the Supernatural is in his bride
[1:09:14] everything that God was he is here and
[1:09:17] it's in his bride
[1:09:21] tonight but if you're not hearing the
[1:09:23] voice
[1:09:24] you don't know how to
[1:09:27] operate cuz you and your home you men
[1:09:30] you you fathers and you daddies and you
[1:09:33] husbands you're the leadership of your
[1:09:35] home you give the
[1:09:38] instruction and that little wife takes
[1:09:40] it and receives it and say yes this is
[1:09:43] how we're going to do cuz see we're not
[1:09:45] there all during the day we're at work
[1:09:47] come on but she takes that voice don't
[1:09:50] you let No Stranger in come on don't let
[1:09:53] them mailman slide through the
[1:09:55] door y'all laugh for that later some of
[1:09:57] y'all some of y'all would never get
[1:10:01] it but she knows she knows what her
[1:10:04] husband wants
[1:10:06] done and she receives it and she
[1:10:09] performs it notice we find here that in
[1:10:12] Revelations 2:11 and through every
[1:10:16] Church age we have the same
[1:10:19] admonition he that had the uh ear to
[1:10:22] hear what the spirit
[1:10:25] saith unto the churches let them
[1:10:29] hear notice to the
[1:10:31] angel of every age he starts off he
[1:10:35] directs the message to the angel and
[1:10:38] then he ends but let he that hath an ear
[1:10:41] hear what the spirit sayth now that's
[1:10:44] not to the Angel that's to the
[1:10:47] hearer so if we can hear now brother
[1:10:50] would tell us also he saids now he would
[1:10:52] take this word God would and he would
[1:10:54] deposit the word to his Angel and that
[1:10:57] angel would take that word and break it
[1:10:59] and begin to reveal it to you and I his
[1:11:01] subjects and that's what God has done in
[1:11:04] this hour Church there's never been
[1:11:06] another Ministry quite like the ministry
[1:11:08] that we're sitting under in this hour
[1:11:10] even if it's 60 years later the word is
[1:11:13] still performing the voice of God is
[1:11:16] still speaking and sons and daughters
[1:11:18] are still listening for that voice
[1:11:21] they're still giving credence for that
[1:11:23] voice they're still alow in that voice
[1:11:25] to change their
[1:11:28] lives so every single age has the same
[1:11:32] admonition to the people of every age he
[1:11:35] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:11:39] spirit
[1:11:40] say but you know it's absolutely brother
[1:11:42] R says it's absolutely impossible for
[1:11:45] all men to hear what the spirit says to
[1:11:48] the different ages then he begins to
[1:11:50] look here in 1 Corinthians 2 and and
[1:11:52] verse 10 says but God hath revealed them
[1:11:54] unto us by spirit for the spirit
[1:11:57] searches all things ye the Deep things
[1:11:59] of God in verse 12 we ex say now we have
[1:12:03] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:12:05] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:12:08] know the things that are freely given to
[1:12:10] us of God verse 14 but the natural man
[1:12:13] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:12:15] of God for they are foolish unto him
[1:12:18] neither can he know them because they
[1:12:20] are spiritually
[1:12:22] discerned then you look here in Matthew
[1:12:24] 13: 133 therefore speak I to them in
[1:12:28] Parables because they seeing see not and
[1:12:30] hearing they hear and neither do they
[1:12:33] understand oh my and in verse 15 for
[1:12:36] this people's heart is waxed gross their
[1:12:38] ears are dull of hearing their eyes they
[1:12:40] have closed lest at any time they should
[1:12:42] see with their eyes and hear with their
[1:12:44] ears and should understand with their
[1:12:46] heart and should be converted and I
[1:12:48] shall heal
[1:12:50] them and then John 8:43 why do you not
[1:12:54] understand my speech even because you
[1:12:56] cannot hear my word so it's not for
[1:13:02] everybody and I'm gonna go into this
[1:13:04] again tomorrow Lord willing if my
[1:13:06] thoughts doesn't change before now and
[1:13:08] then but brother BR would tell us in the
[1:13:10] Samaran Church age putting these verses
[1:13:12] together we see that there is only one
[1:13:15] group of people and that is a very
[1:13:18] special group of
[1:13:20] people oh is that all we get out of that
[1:13:23] I mean come on we're a very special
[1:13:26] group of people and we can't shout we
[1:13:29] can't say Amen we can't say Glory
[1:13:31] Hallelujah to that God is declaring to
[1:13:34] you God is drawing distinction tonight
[1:13:36] showing you tonight it's not for
[1:13:38] everybody but it's for a very special
[1:13:40] group of people who are able to hear
[1:13:44] what the spirit is saying to the age not
[1:13:46] everybody's hearing this
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:51] message not everybody did hear this
[1:13:55] message but it's to a special class a
[1:13:58] special group of people able to hear
[1:14:00] what the spirit says to the age he said
[1:14:02] it is one special group that receives
[1:14:04] the Revelation for the age and that
[1:14:07] group is of God because the group that
[1:14:09] cannot hear is not of God they are the
[1:14:11] ones who have the spirit of God they are
[1:14:14] the ones that are born of God they are
[1:14:15] baptized in the body of Jesus Christ by
[1:14:18] the spirit they are baptized with the
[1:14:20] Holy Ghost then he goes on to say he
[1:14:21] said the church is made up good and
[1:14:28] bad even right here
[1:14:31] tonight the church is made up of three
[1:14:33] kind of
[1:14:34] Believers okay some of you are shouting
[1:14:37] great some of you are sleeping not so
[1:14:40] great but we face it the church is made
[1:14:42] up good and bad two vins make up the
[1:14:44] church they are the the wheat and the
[1:14:46] tears all right and growing up side by
[1:14:50] side but one is the true the other is
[1:14:51] the false and he says now God will speak
[1:14:54] to each one of them he will talk about
[1:14:56] each one of them he will call them
[1:14:58] church but only the elect will really
[1:15:00] know which one is true only the elect
[1:15:03] will not be
[1:15:05] deceived only the elect let me tell you
[1:15:08] that's why some of you get excited

[1:15:23] Heavenly bridegroom that's why I can
[1:15:25] shout that's why I get stimulated
[1:15:27] because I'm catching the revelation of
[1:15:29] the word of who I

[1:17:13] Book of Revelation has more symbols in
[1:17:15] it than all the rest of the books of the

[1:17:20] a book of Prophecy it's a prophetic book

[1:31:47] testimony it ain't much of a testimony
[1:31:50] we had a a tremendous meeting me several
[1:31:52] years ago at our
[1:31:54] church backing up we go to Oklahoma
[1:31:57] Youth Camp and this young girl came up
[1:31:59] in the Prine brother Timothy was
[1:32:00] preaching that week that time was one of
[1:32:03] the first camp meetings that brother
[1:32:04] Wendell did and and this young girl came
[1:32:07] up and I picked it up like that now I'm
[1:32:10] not saying I'm super
[1:32:12] spiritual but I went over brother te I
[1:32:14] say it's a spirit of suicide that's on
[1:32:16] this girl right
[1:32:18] here and uh she she know she come up for
[1:32:21] prayer and she just come up and they
[1:32:22] prayed with her but and then she kind of
[1:32:24] stayed there and I'm like something's
[1:32:25] not right this girl needs Deliverance
[1:32:27] this girl seeking for for God and and I
[1:32:30] just said brother Timothy I said this a
[1:32:31] spirit of suicide and we got to deal
[1:32:33] with it well we begin to pray and we
[1:32:35] begin to deal with this young girl but
[1:32:37] you know you almost get a breakthrough
[1:32:38] but you don't there's times God has a a
[1:32:42] an appointed time for every situation so
[1:32:44] that was sometime around March but then
[1:32:47] it came to our October meetings at
[1:32:49] October and this young girl came her and
[1:32:51] her grandmother that came to the October
[1:32:54] meetings and she was moved on by the
[1:32:57] spirit of God and there was a prayer
[1:32:58] line that formed little prayer line here
[1:33:00] prayer line there me and brother Aaron
[1:33:02] oasby we went out and we begin to work a
[1:33:04] prayer line right there in the middle of
[1:33:05] the aisle and the spirit of deser begin
[1:33:08] to hit and I begin to call that thing
[1:33:10] out Bam Bam Bam Bam and that girl just
[1:33:12] begin to crumble cuz that spirit of
[1:33:14] suicide begin to lift off of her and she
[1:33:16] found her way to the altar begin to cry
[1:33:18] out to God begin to throw her hands up
[1:33:20] and she's come from a broken home come
[1:33:22] from a bad life and yet here she was
[1:33:24] having her moment with God and her
[1:33:26] grandmother was sitting right there
[1:33:27] about the second row and at the end of
[1:33:29] the Ser she come and got her and said
[1:33:31] get up from there you don't act like
[1:33:32] this we didn't do this when I was your
[1:33:35] age
[1:33:37] Lord now that young girl is out in the
[1:33:40] world but grandmother's
[1:33:49] okay Grandma
[1:33:53] Grandma bad
[1:33:55] right but what I'm saying if she was
[1:33:59] having her
[1:34:00] breakthrough and it may not be the way
[1:34:03] you got it all figured
[1:34:04] out it may not happen the way it was
[1:34:07] when you was a young person my goodness
[1:34:09] Fred Flintstone and Barney Flintstone
[1:34:11] they still trying to
[1:34:13] figure out how you was acting back
[1:34:16] then some of y'all get that tomorrow
[1:34:20] too but because it didn't happen the way
[1:34:23] she thought it should happen snatched
[1:34:25] that little girl
[1:34:26] up that spirit of suicide Left her but
[1:34:30] then because of that moment it be to
[1:34:32] come back on her now she's out in the
[1:34:35] world I don't know any reports on her
[1:34:37] but I'm just telling you it may not be
[1:34:39] the way that we have it all figured out
[1:34:40] because we're finite we're different all
[1:34:42] of us here not one of us here tonight
[1:34:44] are going to line up in the same ideas
[1:34:46] and the same strategems in any
[1:34:48] particular way we may get a few things
[1:34:50] that we agree on but we're never going
[1:34:51] to agree
[1:34:54] 100% that's why we're not trusting in
[1:34:56] our own voice but we're trusting in the
[1:34:58] voice of God he's the infinite one he's
[1:35:00] got it all figured out he knows the end
[1:35:03] from the beginning church he knows all

[1:35:09] sicknesses he knows your healings he

[1:38:21] everybody when I first had that thought
[1:38:22] I was
[1:38:23] Pentecostal shouting and dancing and
[1:38:26] jumping brother brother Josh said I got
[1:38:28] me some new shoes is that's when you

[1:38:33] 360s man I wish it was shoes I'd have
[1:38:35] put them on a long time
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:40] ago it makes it a little bit easier
[1:38:42] though brother Josh man a little bit
[1:38:44] lighter a little bit more cushion when
[1:38:45] you
[1:38:47] land let me keep
[1:38:49] preaching amen
[1:38:52] notice now he says The Seven Ages is set
[1:38:56] forth in Revelations chapter 2 through3
[1:38:58] we know that that pertains to or
[1:39:00] pertains to the church ages see taking
[1:39:02] the whole span of the fullness of the
[1:39:04] Gentiles or the whole time in which God
[1:39:06] is dealing with the Gentiles on
[1:39:08] salvation in every single age Bar
[1:39:12] None it says that the very same thing in
[1:39:15] the opening and closing of the message
[1:39:17] he changed unto the messenger of Ephesus
[1:39:20] samna pergamus Tara Sardis Philadelphia
[1:39:23] Le oia write these things sayith etc etc
[1:39:28] he that hath an ear let him him Singler
[1:39:31] hear what the spirit sath to the
[1:39:33] churches
[1:39:34] not notice here that Jesus by the spirit
[1:39:37] in every age addresses himself only to
[1:39:40] one person relative to the work for that
[1:39:44] age come only one messenger for each age
[1:39:48] excuse me receives what the spirit has
[1:39:50] to say to that age and that one
[1:39:53] messenger is a messenger to the church
[1:39:55] age yeah he speaks for God's by
[1:39:58] Revelation to the churches both true and
[1:39:59] false the message is then broadcast to
[1:40:02] all but though it's broadcast for all
[1:40:04] whom come within range of the message
[1:40:06] that message is received individually by
[1:40:09] only a certain qualified group in a
[1:40:13] certain
[1:40:15] way W that's
[1:40:18] rich man that's rich he says now those
[1:40:21] who here are not getting their own
[1:40:24] private Revelation nor is a group
[1:40:26] getting a their Collective Revelation
[1:40:29] but each person is hearing and receiving
[1:40:32] what the messenger has already received
[1:40:35] from God that's why the prophet of God
[1:40:38] will say say What's on the takes don't
[1:40:42] put your own ideas to it don't put your
[1:40:44] own Traditions to it say what the tape
[1:40:47] say that's where it is why because
[1:40:49] you're not getting your own private
[1:40:51] interpretation you're not getting a
[1:40:53] collective interpretation but they're
[1:40:55] saying the very same thing that the
[1:40:58] messeng receive from the voice of God
[1:41:01] they're saying the same thing that he
[1:41:04] says that's right so with that being
[1:41:07] said I have a question for
[1:41:09] you why is there a Thunder Group
[1:41:13] yeah why is there a peruja group why is
[1:41:18] there a two group in a return camp why
[1:41:21] we have all these different
[1:41:25] Revelations if we're to hear from the
[1:41:29] voice and it's the same voice from the
[1:41:32] same messenger who got it from God
[1:41:35] Almighty and we're listening to that
[1:41:37] voice how do we have all these different
[1:41:39] factions within the message it tells me
[1:41:43] that somebody is not hearing the voice
[1:41:45] of God but they g off they heard
[1:41:48] something it may be not in oper truth
[1:41:51] but the devil's injected something there
[1:41:53] and they going off on the seed on this
[1:41:55] idea and the seed on that idea but the
[1:41:58] true bride the True Church of the Living
[1:42:00] God she's not going to go on that idea
[1:42:02] she's gonna stay with the voice of
[1:42:10] God Only One
[1:42:12] messenger come on now in England there's
[1:42:17] Elohim in South Africa there's a Holy
[1:42:19] Ghost
[1:42:21] men claiming to be
[1:42:23] Elohim men claiming to be the Holy Ghost
[1:42:27] himself men claiming to be the eighth
[1:42:29] messenger well in order to be the eighth
[1:42:31] messenger you just did everything away
[1:42:33] with Book of Revelations because there's
[1:42:35] only
[1:42:37] seven so if we're listening to The Voice
[1:42:40] young people hear me because you may
[1:42:41] hear this stuff preached way out there
[1:42:43] and it may have a lot of truth to it but
[1:42:45] if it don't line up with the Bible if it
[1:42:47] don't filter through the message of the
[1:42:48] hour it's not the voice of God
[1:42:51] it's got to line up all the way through
[1:42:53] that's why the prophet of God said
[1:42:54] preach it Gun Barrel
[1:42:57] straight and stay with what's on those
[1:43:01] tapes you hear a lot of people well
[1:43:03] brother bam said this and brother bam
[1:43:05] said that and you go back and you try to
[1:43:06] find a brother didn't say nothing about
[1:43:09] it come on no this done here say pass
[1:43:13] down this one said it this one said it
[1:43:14] this one said it and maybe he may have
[1:43:16] mentioned something around a campfire
[1:43:17] hunting trip but if it ain't on those
[1:43:19] tapes don't you hang your soul on
[1:43:22] something that you can't back it up
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:26] with man put their own idea to that's
[1:43:29] right true and here's the thing Church
[1:43:33] prophet of God preach but Paul preach
[1:43:35] yes he Jonathan brother Thomas brother
[1:43:38] different ministers here how many
[1:43:39] ministers we got here tonight come on

[1:44:03] day yes I was preaching a youth meeting
[1:44:05] long time ago brother Thomas my daughter
[1:44:07] was nine years old my oldest this about
[1:44:08] 11 years ago I said brother window
[1:44:10] Martins I was preaching on a fresh
[1:44:13] experience thirsting for the things of
[1:44:16] God my nine-year-old little girl lawen
[1:44:18] she's a very conservative very sweet
[1:44:20] little girl and me and her we didn't
[1:44:21] have a it's an odd deal because we
[1:44:24] didn't really have a real good
[1:44:25] relationship she always went to her
[1:44:28] mama maybe because Papa looks scary I
[1:44:30] don't know maybe so I took her and a
[1:44:33] group of kids up I was preaching this
[1:44:35] you weekend and leadings there for
[1:44:37] brother Wendell and I begin to preach
[1:44:39] and at the end of that service man the
[1:44:40] power of God hit and Holy Ghost fell and
[1:44:43] there was a bunch of kids at the altar
[1:44:45] my little Lauren was at the altar
[1:44:46] snotting and crying and received the
[1:44:48] Holy Ghost at 9 years old
[1:44:52] let me tell you why she didn't hear from
[1:44:54] Daddy the Holy Ghost wasn't mind to give
[1:44:57] her but she heard from almighty God and
[1:45:00] God came down and look me and her got a
[1:45:01] great relationship
[1:45:04] to me and her like that brother Thomas
[1:45:06] we buds because we got a connection then
[1:45:10] I had the privilege of leading my my
[1:45:12] daughter Rebecca and my youngest
[1:45:13] daughter Caroline to the Lord at the
[1:45:15] same time in the same night and then
[1:45:17] several months later during Co I baptize
[1:45:19] him in the same service
[1:45:23] my
[1:45:24] God that's wonderful why because I'm
[1:45:27] preaching not my own idea I'm not
[1:45:29] preaching Tim PR religion I'm not
[1:45:31] preaching Donnie Reagan religion I'm not
[1:45:33] preaching Thomas Bor religion I'm not
[1:45:35] preaching Joseph Hammond religion I'm
[1:45:36] not teach preaching R Spencer religion
[1:45:39] I'm preaching Paul's gospel I'm
[1:45:41] preaching that same gospel that was
[1:45:43] instituted several thousand years ago
[1:45:45] and if it worked then it works today
[1:45:47] Church don't you dissect it don't you
[1:45:49] compromise just stay with that anointed
[1:45:52] word it'll bring the same
[1:45:55] results it'll produce the same signs
[1:45:57] it'll produce the same wonders every yes
[1:46:03] sir says if you are a Christian you will
[1:46:06] get back to what the spirit is teaching
[1:46:09] that is the word of this age and Paul
[1:46:12] will say If any man preach any other
[1:46:15] gospel than what they what what what you
[1:46:18] have received let him be a cursed
[1:46:21] that's
[1:46:22] right so brother bam they said hey he
[1:46:24] went beyond the curtain of
[1:46:26] time he said what about Paul he said he
[1:46:29] said will Paul be there he said Paul and
[1:46:31] his group will be there he says well
[1:46:33] good cuz I'm preaching exactly what
[1:46:35] Paul's preaching right so brother Thomas
[1:46:39] you and your group will be there because
[1:46:42] you're preaching the same thing Paul's
[1:46:43] preaching that's right brother Jonathan
[1:46:45] you and your family and those that you
[1:46:47] get to preach to Brother Brad brother
[1:46:49] Phillip you're going to preach to and
[1:46:50] they're going to be there because why
[1:46:52] you're preaching the same word that Paul

[1:46:57] preach that Luther preach that Iranian
[1:47:00] oh come on somebody you're preaching the
[1:47:02] same word that William Brandon preached
[1:47:05] it's the same and it will bring the same
[1:47:07] results cuz it's not the voice of a man
[1:47:10] but it's the voice of
[1:47:12] God it's going to bring the same results
[1:47:15] every time notice the Bible will tell us
[1:47:18] that the spirit in the bride

[1:47:22] come no the bride is not saying
[1:47:24] something contrary to the husband no the

[1:51:03] servant enter into the joys of the Lord
[1:51:08] but if we're all caught up in our own
[1:51:10] self always got to be right you know
[1:51:14] brother B said I'd rather be right in my
[1:51:16] spirit and wrong in my
[1:51:18] Doctrine he'd rather be right in his
[1:51:21] spirit because see he can fix his
[1:51:24] Doctrine but if you're wrong in your
[1:51:26] spirit you can cause a lot of damage
[1:51:30] abely and I'm not saying that ain't none
[1:51:32] of us ever been wrong in our spirit at
[1:51:34] times but thank God we're quick to
[1:51:36] repent we're quick the Zeal of the hour
[1:51:39] is to repent and say Lord I'm sorry I'm
[1:51:42] sorry that I didn't have the right
[1:51:43] attitude I'm sorry Lord that you know a
[1:51:45] lot of times we look at the preacher and
[1:51:47] you know maybe he ain't our favorite
[1:51:48] preacher come on go ahead you know short
[1:51:51] and dumpy I ain't looking at
[1:51:56] you I ain't looking at you
[1:51:58] either I'm looking at
[1:52:01] me short and dumpy but I'm cute so it
[1:52:04] don't matter he short and dumpy all they
[1:52:07] want to be not everybody can be Andrew
[1:52:10] Glover tall dark and
[1:52:12] [Laughter]
[1:52:17] handsome I don't know where I was going
[1:52:19] I just to myself completely off track we
[1:52:22] better keep on
[1:52:24] going but see God has called all of us
[1:52:28] to hear the voice of this hour and
[1:52:31] there's only one
[1:52:34] voice and if the ministry the fivefold
[1:52:37] ministry is lined up to the word it'll
[1:52:39] be speaking the same voice that's why we
[1:52:42] can't give into push play and Obey is
[1:52:45] because that doesn't line up with the
[1:52:48] word that doesn't line up with look Paul
[1:52:52] didn't establish the fivefold ministry
[1:52:55] God Almighty established the fivefold
[1:52:58] men for the edifying of the
[1:53:01] body cuz see some of you you like
[1:53:04] teaching some of you like pastorship
[1:53:07] some of you like preaching some of you
[1:53:09] like evangelism we all are different
[1:53:11] nature so God put it all in five
[1:53:13] different types of Ministries so that
[1:53:16] it'll feed not only the children but
[1:53:17] it'll feed the grandchildren yeah it'll
[1:53:20] feed the grandparents it'll feed those
[1:53:21] old ones and all they want is that old
[1:53:23] time religion what God's got it packed
[1:53:25] right there in the Bible and maybe next
[1:53:27] month next week sometime next year God
[1:53:29] will send somebody in here and it'll be
[1:53:31] the right kind of ministry that you like
[1:53:32] and you can feed on it but let me tell
[1:53:34] you it's still got to be the voice of
[1:53:37] God but sometimes we get so caught up in
[1:53:40] the
[1:53:42] vessel especially when you get close to
[1:53:44] the vessel yes you know you get close to
[1:53:48] me you going to realize I'm human yes
[1:53:52] that's right I'm human that's the truth
[1:53:54] I'm not a robot you're not a robot I'm
[1:53:57] not perfect you're not perfect but you
[1:53:59] find if you get so close and you begin
[1:54:02] to know that person a little bit more
[1:54:04] intricate than maybe what you normally
[1:54:07] would then when you sit there and he's
[1:54:09] preaching and because you know these
[1:54:11] little
[1:54:13] things sometimes Satan will sit there
[1:54:15] and make it hard for you to receive yeah
[1:54:18] yeah makes it hard you to receive
[1:54:20] because you're listening to the voice of
[1:54:22] a
[1:54:23] man versus the voice of God
[1:54:27] yeah that's it but if you can push past
[1:54:30] the veil push past to humanity push past
[1:54:33] his mistakes and his
[1:54:35] flaws you know and recognize that we're
[1:54:38] everyone's the
[1:54:39] same and realize if I can push past that
[1:54:43] and I can hear what the spirit is saying
[1:54:47] yes and if I can hear tonight what the
[1:54:50] spirit wants out of this service then I
[1:54:52] can hear the voice of God it may not be
[1:54:56] little 5 foot 6 actually I'm 5 foot five
[1:54:58] and a half I don't tell
[1:55:00] nobody I lost a whole inch last year I
[1:55:02] went to the doctor after I quit my job
[1:55:05] or retired or whatever you want to call
[1:55:06] it and had to go get insurance she
[1:55:08] measured me brother Thomas almost
[1:55:11] cried I've been 5' six and a half all my
[1:55:13] life all of a sudden I was 5' five and a
[1:55:15] half she goes we just going to call you
[1:55:16] 5 foot 6 I said well bless your heart
[1:55:22] I'll take it I lost a whole inch but she
[1:55:25] gave me a half an inch back that made my
[1:55:28] day you try being 5 foot five and a half
[1:55:31] it ain't fun y'all some tall people in
[1:55:33] that lter
[1:55:34] family man every last one of y'all tall
[1:55:36] and big y'all ain't Little People sure
[1:55:39] y' ain't part of that Anakin group no
[1:55:41] I'm
[1:55:42] kidding I'm just
[1:55:45] teasing I just wish I could be
[1:55:48] tall yeah that's a dream I have every
[1:55:50] now and then being
[1:55:53] tall notice let me go on my goodness my
[1:55:57] wife saying boy would you please
[1:56:00] stop we're GNA bring this baby home
[1:56:02] we're going to land this airplane we
[1:56:03] like brother je for we about to
[1:56:05] parachute out all
[1:56:07] right we're gonna Land This Plane here
[1:56:09] in just a
[1:56:11] minute so there's so many voices there
[1:56:13] we discuss there's a voice of politics
[1:56:16] you know 60 years ago America America
[1:56:19] voted in their first Democratic or First
[1:56:21] Catholic President and now we got almost
[1:56:24] a entire political system is full of
[1:56:28] Catholics so Protestants make up 55% of
[1:56:31] the seats of the House and Senate
[1:56:32] because there's so many different
[1:56:34] factions of the Protestant religion in
[1:56:36] the house the Catholic religion makes up
[1:56:38] the majority that's in the house and the
[1:56:40] Senate our supreme court system is
[1:56:42] almost 99% Catholic and now we got a
[1:56:45] president that's Catholic so you hear
[1:56:47] the voice of liberalism
[1:56:50] that's being produced throughout the
[1:56:51] land you hear you see laws being passed
[1:56:55] because it's the voice of the enemy
[1:56:56] that's going forth little by little and
[1:56:58] then you young people you got Hollywood
[1:57:00] the voice of Hollywood like I spoke
[1:57:01] about last night Disney and their new
[1:57:03] movie Pauline where a young girl who has
[1:57:06] one night stand with the devil and is
[1:57:07] pregnated with his kid these are voices
[1:57:09] and they're trying to desensitize you to
[1:57:12] the things of God so that you will not
[1:57:14] hear the voice that's being preached in
[1:57:17] the house of
[1:57:18] God
[1:57:19] see Hollywood films glorify sex violence
[1:57:22] attracting or attacking the moral values
[1:57:24] of all societies and they try to to pray
[1:57:28] on the young people because they know
[1:57:29] that's the
[1:57:30] generation and now you find that now
[1:57:32] there's laws being passed in some states
[1:57:35] to where you cannot tell your kid that
[1:57:37] they're boy or girl male or female you
[1:57:39] have to wait till they get to a certain
[1:57:41] age and let them
[1:57:43] decide look that decision was made in
[1:57:46] heaven that was already made God formed
[1:57:49] him and fashion him the way he wanted
[1:57:51] them but yet you hear that voice coming
[1:57:53] in this
[1:57:54] hour but the true
[1:57:57] church she's going to hear the voice of
[1:58:00] God she's going to heed to the voice of
[1:58:02] God so in closing I want the musicians
[1:58:04] if you just make your way
[1:58:07] back you've been a wonderful group to
[1:58:09] preach to
[1:58:10] but but B said there's going to come a
[1:58:14] time that when your wandering Soul have
[1:58:16] been taken from your body and this
[1:58:19] destination somewhere wandering Yonder
[1:58:21] in darkness and either into the bosom of
[1:58:23] God the voice will speak again the Bible
[1:58:25] said that all those that are in the
[1:58:27] grave shall hear his voice and shall
[1:58:29] come out some shall come out to
[1:58:31] Everlasting shame and contentment others
[1:58:33] shall come out to Everlasting peace and
[1:58:34] joy but think about it tonight
[1:58:37] church just for a few moments
[1:58:41] now maybe you're here tonight
[1:58:44] and and you've been giving credence to
[1:58:47] all these other voices some of you may
[1:58:48] have
[1:58:50] may have listened to the voice of
[1:58:54] depression just play something soft if
[1:58:56] you would
[1:58:57] please maybe you're here and you've been
[1:59:00] given into to the voice of
[1:59:02] discouragement right anxiety is
[1:59:05] overwhelmed you nervousness has taken
[1:59:07] you and back of your mind the voice of
[1:59:10] suicide is just sitting right there just
[1:59:13] just take your life just do it end it
[1:59:15] right now nobody's going to miss you you
[1:59:18] won't even be missed
[1:59:19] [Music]
[1:59:23] and I'll share something with you and I
[1:59:25] shared this not too long ago at our
[1:59:27] church I had a very stressful
[1:59:29] job and I got into a very dark place a
[1:59:32] low place I wouldn't say dark but a very
[1:59:34] a very low moment in my my walk with the
[1:59:37] Lord and not that I was back sitting
[1:59:38] because I wasn't I was still a preacher
[1:59:40] of the gospel and uh but we had our
[1:59:42] special meetings many years ago and and
[1:59:45] and brother Ron Spencer was there and he
[1:59:46] preached a message jealousy at the altar
[1:59:50] and I went to that service and you know
[1:59:53] you you get jealous of this guy and that
[1:59:55] guy maybe he's getting preached more
[1:59:56] you're not getting preach enough and you
[1:59:59] got all these you know the the the the
[2:00:01] politics of churches and who's who's and
[2:00:04] all that and if you're not careful you
[2:00:05] can get worked up in that and you're
[2:00:08] listening to the wrong voice yeah and I
[2:00:11] brother Thomas I'm just being honest
[2:00:12] it's transparent with you begin to
[2:00:14] listen to the wrong voice like why don't
[2:00:16] the Lord use me you know I'm ready but
[2:00:19] yet my job was so stressful that it just
[2:00:22] kept me and my wife can testify kept me
[2:00:24] in a very low place and hey praise God a
[2:00:27] year and a half ago I became a brand new
[2:00:28] man yeah but one night we went to that
[2:00:31] service that night and I drove I had to
[2:00:33] work late probably till 7 o'clock and I
[2:00:35] drove there and just in that you know
[2:00:37] you just get in a funk I maybe y'all use
[2:00:39] that word here funk you know you're just
[2:00:41] in a cloud you're in dark place seems
[2:00:43] like nothing's going right you can't see
[2:00:45] God and you can't hear God and you
[2:00:47] definitely ain't hearing the voice of
[2:00:48] God
[2:00:49] [Applause]
[2:00:50] and I wanted to breakr I really wanted
[2:00:52] to break through I didn't like it I
[2:00:53] didn't like how I felt I didn't like how
[2:00:55] I was feeling I didn't like how I acted
[2:00:57] toward my wife toward my kids toward my
[2:00:58] church toward anything I didn't like I
[2:01:00] mean I just I didn't like
[2:01:03] myself and so when I left that service
[2:01:05] that night I pulled out I was by myself
[2:01:07] I pulled out onto the main highway there
[2:01:09] Highway
[2:01:10] 371 and there was an 18 Wood brother the
[2:01:13] time was coming and the devil spoke in
[2:01:14] my ear said pull off right in front of
[2:01:16] that 18 Willer right
[2:01:18] now
[2:01:19] and nobody will miss
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:23] you and for a split second I listen to
[2:01:27] that
[2:01:28] voice for a split
[2:01:31] second but in the voice of God begin to
[2:01:34] speak but you're a Son of
[2:01:35] God I'll be a refuge that's right I'll
[2:01:39] be a high tower just come underneath my
[2:01:42] wings you can find help in your time of
[2:01:45] need and maybe see I was in a place of
[2:01:47] real dark depression
[2:01:49] and not trying to play it off but you
[2:01:51] know what you can't play it off but
[2:01:53] there's only one way to get True
[2:01:54] Deliverance is to hear the voice of God
[2:01:57] and maybe that's you tonight depressions
[2:01:59] tried to consume you and fears tried to
[2:02:01] consume you and anxieties and all the
[2:02:04] stresses and suicide sitting there just
[2:02:06] chirping in your ear but I want you to
[2:02:08] know tonight there's a voice here
[2:02:11] there's a presence here there's a power
[2:02:13] here won't you just bow your head just
[2:02:14] for a minute
[2:02:16] tonight if that be you tonight young or
[2:02:19] old cuz we all face these
[2:02:22] battles if that be you and you you've
[2:02:25] heard that voice and it's chattered in
[2:02:26] your ear and you contemplated suicide
[2:02:30] and you wrestled with depression and and
[2:02:33] you just kind of given yourself over to
[2:02:35] these doubts and reasoning is the
[2:02:37] message right is the prophet true is
[2:02:39] this something that I've always been
[2:02:41] told because Mom and Daddy believe
[2:02:43] believe it but but really I got no joy I
[2:02:45] got no peace I got no happiness but what
[2:02:48] about you
[2:02:49] tonight if that be one of you tonight I
[2:02:52] don't believe God led me last week to
[2:02:54] speak this in
[2:02:56] vain but I believe God has got a voice
[2:02:58] for you to hear and he's telling you
[2:03:01] tonight your deliverance is in the house
[2:03:03] yes Lord your Miracle is in the room
[2:03:06] your healing is here tonight if
[2:03:09] depression if depression is taking you

[2:04:27] Ghost but you know there's one initial
[2:04:29] feeling but what about a refilling what

[2:06:29] last
[2:06:31] week and Lord as I studied throughout
[2:06:34] today I had no idea the direction by
[2:06:36] which you would have us to go Lord as
[2:06:38] far as how the service would flow from
[2:06:41] the beginning to the end but but God I
[2:06:44] know to trust
[2:06:45] you and Lord if it's just for one soul
[2:06:48] it's worth it all it's worth the hours

[2:06:56] to be here for one soul for you said one
[2:06:59] soul is worth 10,000

[2:07:36] vessel and Lord as your Prophet would
[2:07:39] say you're not feeding on the the voice
