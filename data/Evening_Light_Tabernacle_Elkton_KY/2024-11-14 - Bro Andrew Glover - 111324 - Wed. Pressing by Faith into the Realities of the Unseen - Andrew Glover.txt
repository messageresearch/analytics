chunk out and we're going to do the autopsy on that chunk or whatever you anyway so uh biopsy thank you brother David for for correcting me on that one praise the Lord but Don is in good spirits amen amen and I'm trying to be so praise the Lord amen no not just trying but God's helping us so amen it seems uh seems the Lord we I just amen um I was going to speak maybe 15 minutes I wasn't I I'm just going to speak a little bit and then speak a little more maybe am me hard to amen amen so I better watch it here because I got different thoughts but uh so we'll speaking our message that the Lord has kind of laid on my heart for Sunday but we had real friend amen a real friend that come and brother Andrew Glover amen he uh he's showed up amen he uh texted me a few days ago and want to know what our church times are and and so forth and I give him our church times and so brother Brad called me this afternoon said he was here and then brother uh Andrew also texted me said he's here he's just here coming to visit and see us so about you but that means a lot to me amen whether he's preaching or not he's going to come he wants to come see us amen shows that he really loves and concerns So I says well I'll tell you what you know why should we have a a pony preaching can have a real horse oh uh anyway and as big as one too any well I know she got to watch that I I'll be in trouble right but just tall anyway as far I want to talk to these good quotes and you know what the word says what the quotes say and so forth and then I thought about brother Andrew and my goodness gracious I'll tell you what well here comes a new thought you know I might be a 22 but that guy's a Gatling gun all right when he spits him out I'm here to better go hide right because I know brother Andrew and I'll tell you what I don't know anybody preaches Harder Faster and more true and more honest and so we're certainly looking forward to at it and so amen so we'll try to uh amen just looking forward to that amen uh all right we're going to turn it over brother Joshua if you'll come and worship uh I don't else right now we'll we'll keep everybody posted and updated okay amen and we're believing I know what I was going to say a little bit more maybe I was going to say you know I do believe that uh nothing happens unless God has permitted it amen the devil has to have permission is that right and that the God won't perit anything amen but what he's going to receive Glory and Honor out ofen amen he's seen fit to uh uh allow to H happen to me and Donna amen you know to Donna but if I say me and Donna because she's part of me how many knows we're we're one so if it happens to one it happens to me amen and so uh you know to see and I thought I thought this was kind of a a gradu what is this maybe a graduation trial I I I think of it as the ultimate this is the ultimate test this is the ultimate test amen amen and I thought of it like two Gladiators you know the in the old days they would have Gladiator fights right and sometimes they would say well now this fight here between the two one can live only one can live it's life and death that's the kind of trial it is amen so it's pretty serious amen it's not like well you've got cancer but we can cut it out and you've got a 80% chance amen is that right but this here when they tell you that well they tell you that you aren't going to make it right so then they're saying it's uh life or death so I so I accept it as that ain't that right it's to the death one's going to die one's going to die amen the devil cancer is't that right the other thing is in this fight and in this battle this is also the way I see it this is to do streaming or anybody is that for me and my wife if we lose we're still winning we're we're we still win and if the devil wins he still loses amen Give the Lord a hand that's right that's right because we win either way so we're going to win in this game in this fight praise the Lord how many we're going to win amen and so like I said he's he's the loser that is a loser amen and so even like I I was thinking even if he win he still lose you know because uh he he can't win there's no way that he can't win because we are we win either way so praise be to God Amen so God bless you amen how you know the other thing know if the devil thinks he's going to knock us down slow us down or anything he's got I've got news for him we're not down all this is going to do is bring us closer to God I was thinking on the church uh on on the way to church I says you know this is is going to give us a big bump it already has me and my wife it has given us a bump closer to God like you ain't never seen and to each other amen and I know it has you you know and all of this remember this I know y'all are feeling too we understand we're all how many knows we're all one body we are a family amen hurts all hurts and so amen but uh amen so we're just so thankful and believing and and knowing that uh you know this this is is I think brother Troy no doubt he's went through things you know and but you know this is Battle rages between faith and doubt amen and so in this in this battle there's uh those who think you might not make it those who don't believe you're gonna make it you know and those who maybe don't want you to make but there's those that believe that you're going to make it amen and I amen amen and we don't care nothing about the rest amen we care about those who believe that you're G to make it amen that's who we're focusing all of our critics all the devil his critics and his doubting stuff you know we cast it all out amen so God bless you we love one another amen how how many wants to praise the Lord amen let's praise him like never before let's

you held on all of your might child Christ have a the master for for he knows your voice lift your hands it's time to Rejoice your cries have awoken the master and it hit you without any warning had begun seen no hope in the distance you're frightened and nowhere to run and by now your vessel is filling and you're thinking that you'll surely drown you cried out for for help from the Savior and you you can't give up and now because you prayed all night cuz you've held on all of your might child master sing it one more more time because you prayed because you've held on with all of your child your cry have awoken the [Music] master amen how many thankful tonight to know that your cries amen they can awaken the master amen no matter what you're going through or what you're facing amen he's he is within crying distance amen I love the scripture that says he amen he hears our cries and delivers us out of all amen of our afflictions and I know tonight there are many afflictions but there's not one Affliction the devil can put on the church but what God is able to take it off and amen it wonderful to have a god like that tonight that amen knows every detail of our lives and amen we want to say God bless you all tonight we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus J Christ it is a a real honor to be here tonight and and just want to say we we sure didn't come to preach we just wanted to come and see brother B amen we had heard the news there the other day and amen just by and see our our dear friends and we sure sure love and appreciate brother Tom and sister Donna amen I tell you they've done so much for the body of Christ through the years and amen especially the young people all the years they've poured into amen the generation that's on the scene now in control of everything and amen I believe the Lord is greater than any diagnosis or any report and amen I was the other day um was in Canada there in Saskatoon when had heard about the diagnosis and things and my mind automatically prophet of God he said there in the god hiding himself in Simplicity he said whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he said it's to those who believe his report and you know tonight amen if we just receive one report then the the devil he'll extend everything he's got to us through doubt and fear but if we can believe his report tonight extend to us the arm of the Lord and I believe that's what we're here tonight to do is to receive from him and let's just bow our hearts together tonight for a word of prayer I know it's a Wednesday evening any needs and let's just approach him tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday after church members they're not just religious people but father lord they're rugged Believers as your Prophet T lord it's easy to serve you when everything's going well and there's no's Gathering but Lord the times that we really serve you and grow is when everything is us but yet Lord there's still a desire in our heart to serve you and together in your house worship you in the midst of the storm and tonight Lord As We Gather here father you see the need of assembly tonight oh God lord you see the needs of each and every believer here tonight we're thaning tonight our sister Donna Lord father we're believing your word is greater than any report and father I know this assembly has been lordly established upon this end time Revelation and Lord there's many testimonies and I believe there's many more testimonies to come and Lord I pray that through this trial oh God that you would place your hand upon our brother Tom Lord may you your hand upon sister Donna father upon the family the children oh God upon this assembly Lord may your angels encamp around them Father Lord I bind the hand of Satan Lord I bind his voice of negativity fear doubt Satan you are defeated in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we stand up on the authority of the word of God and we rebuke you in the name of Jesus father minister to the children here tonight move us aside oh God and speak to hearts and lives to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers amen and amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go to the Book of Luke the 16th chapter we have a few places we tonight in Luke chapter 16 and then also Philippians chapter 3 my this is the first time I've seen your new pull pit I love it brother Thomas it's beautiful amen amen Luke chapter 16 and verse number you love the Lord tonight amen amen Luke 16: 16 Jesus here speaking he says now the law and the prophets un John but since that time the kingdom preached and every man presseth into it I love that the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it so there is a preaching of the Kingdom there is a pressing into it the kingdom of God is preached in every man presseth into it Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 I know a very familiar reading to you as a Believer tonight you can probably read it uh from your from memory in Philippians chapter 3 and verse number 13 Paul here writing he says Brethren I count not my have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth those things which are before now watch what he says I pray toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus I think it's Paul is instructing the church that there are some things that are behind us but he's saying going back to they're actually worth forgetting and leaving behind us and then pressing forth unto the thing that are in front of us now in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 I believe this here is the way that a Believer presses forward we'll find it in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 13 Paul here writing he says now we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken now watch here so there's a there's a speaker that would be Paul right as I believed I spoke and now watch he turns it it says we also believe and therefore we speak I believe the church Living God presses forward by believing the things that have been spoken in The Same Spirit of faith that they were spoken in now in verse 18 He says this while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal things which are not seen are Eternal we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of you can have your seats here this afternoon for just a few moments tonight if the Lord would help me I would like to talk to you for a few moments here on pressing by faith realities of the Unseen pressing by faith reties of the Unseen of course in Luke 16 Philippians 3 we read there about the word press and in in the Webster dictionary he actually says that press actually means to move or to cause to move into a position of contact now contact with someone or something amen by exer physical Force so when you begin to press up on something you're actually pressing in order to move into a position of contact amen with something of a higher power now of God tells us amen that the most powerful force there is is God how many age there is no more powerful force than God then he'll come along and say and one of the do they say well I tell you I found this amen that the great power in the world is not the atomic bomb he says but a believer in contact his maker amen I'll just go ahead and say it if there is a Believer here tonight and I believe there is amen you all can testify amen that if you are in contact with God you didn't get there easy amen it wasn't an easy walk it wasn't an easy Journey but you had to press am then be on some things to get into contact with God he said but when a Believer gets in contact with God he said it will change his whole attitude it will change his mental it will change his habit it will change his body it will change his nature amen it everything so when a Believer comes in contact amen with his maker just coming in contact amen has the ability to change everything about that believer 1949 subject of science he said now I was just thinking of how that science how they're taking the natural man and how he's went into the research from the Fallen natural and what he has done he said how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of God he said I was thinking the natural man went out at the Unseen of his eye amen and he pulled an Adam down out of the sky and he split the Adam and two and that destroys human life he said but if the natural man that knows nothing of God and cannot know nothing of God except he be converted then his soul becomes alive with the supernatural he said now if he could do that in the natural realm amen then what ought the man of God to be doing he said my friends the church is so far behind he said let's pray my that God Amen will move his church up he said the natural man with the natural resources is getting greater results than people are amen that call themselves Christians now listen to The Prophet amen let's press into the Unseen amen let's press into the Unseen amen the blessing are there amen they're yours and they're there for you listen the prophet of God is not telling seen he's not telling us amen just to settle for what we can we can feel or what we can hear amen but he's saying there is place that we can go amen that is an eternal place and unseen Place listen if there is a Believer here tonight that desires a blessing amen a prophet has identified where that blessing is he said the blessing of God are in the Unseen he said every blessing that he died for amen is ours right now he said oh God Amen help us to have faith tonight can I just tell you how how how determined God is for you to receive his Blessing he said let's have faith tonight amen to use your that you said it was ours let us claim it tonight every god-given privilege that we have so God has these blessings there amen but if you don't have the faith amen within yourself to get the blessing he said God will give you his own faith Amen in order for you to climb up into that Dimension and to receive that blessing now I don't know about you we don't have to stay Earth we don't have to stay under the control amen of what the devil says and what the devil thinks been called as the Church of the Living God Amen to believe God in the face of every obstacle Amen in the face of every opposition Amen to stand on the word of God and de claim the things amen God has given us now amen as Believers you all are not unfamiliar with the word unseen as a matter of fact brother bam preaches that sermon about three times amen looking at the Unseen 1950 he said now amen we look at the Unseen amen and believe that those things which are unseen amen but spoke of by God Amen they become realities I got to reading that the other day and it just got all over me am that we look at the Unseen amen and we believe that those things which are unseen but they are spoke of by God Amen they become realities he said another place 1959 looking at the he said we are told amen that we have an outward man and an inward man he said now the outward man looks by his eyes amen but the inward walks by faith he say so we have to be led by one of these two persons amen the out that outward man is self amen but the inward man is God he said you see we do not see with our eyes though many times we thought we see with our eyes he said we only look with our eyes amen but we see with our heart amen we look with our eyes amen but we see with our heart listen if you're looking for the spiritual blessings amen that Paul promised you in Ephesians chapter 1 amen with the natural eye you're never going to see it amen but God has sent a prophet in this generation who said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet shall turn the heart amen before the great and Dreadful day listen the message did not come Amen to turn our eyes it came to turn our hearts and the only way we can see a miracle is by looking with our hearts the only way we can see a victory amen is by looking with our heart I believe the time has come for the church amen of the Living God to look away away from the things of the world Amen to look away from the reports of the devil I believe the time has come amen for the Believers to press amen but not to press backwards amen not to go to the left to the right amen but the time has come Amen to press forward the prophet of God said we work together as one unit see we have to get our differences away we have to lay aside our doctr things amen and put our arms together amen and press forward and take the promise that God Almighty has given us I don't know about you tonight amen but I believe we're under a Divine commission amen and I believe that is a Divine commission Amen to possess Divine promises amen we are not profess amen we are possessors we have promises to possess in the land of our inheritance the prophet of God said a man that's commissioned of God Amen he looks upward and onward he said you don't have to care what the world says about it anyhow amen he's not listening to the world he's got a Divine con from God and he is enjoying that presence ening the presence of the Holy Ghost amen Among Us in the hour that we're living in now I know the Holy Ghost comes Among Us and man amen don't you love to feel the Holy Ghost and then don't you love to feel the power of God you just shout all over the building you know amen Just Dance up down the aisles and have a good a good time and presence amen but I believe the Holy Ghost is doing more amen than just making a shout or making a dance amen but I believe the Holy Ghost is making us perseverant word perseverant means to be persistent Amen in order to make a goal the prophet of God said a man that's ever amounted to anything at any time through any age has been men who believed in God they had faith in God and they the enemy on every side and was perseverant because they believed in God he said I believe every Christian therefore amen should be very perseverant listen if you are a Christian tonight it's time to quit being casual it's time to be perseverance amen the devil is not going to move aside amen and give you the inheritance he's not going to move aside amen and give you hey but if you are a son of God you have got the same faith in you that was in shamgar when he said listen the Phil will not defy me I'll take an ox gold and I will drive out the Philistine I am ordained to take my inheritance my goodness I as a Son of God as a daughter of God Amen to believe God I don't know what you're facing but there's a word it's a perseverant word and if you can believe God the Mountain Ain't Too Tall and the valley ain't too low and the giant ain't too big but God the scene and tell tear the thing down Hallelujah I'm talking about Christians amen who are perseverance amen and they press towards the mark of the High Calling amen they're very persevering in their claims to God let me say this Paul said forget those things the he said now I press towards the mark of the High Calling to the complete ification when all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus place he said we're not going to have a rearview mirror Affair he only looks back and sees where you have been he said but we are looking for see where we're going my goodness amen I'll say this to you amen but it time to look in the rearview mirror and say this is where we been what we've done I say if there's ever been a time Amen to look forward Church of the Living God now the time to look forward I know that and that your best days are behind you that's what the devil said he says your best days are behind you amen but let me tell you what the word says he's a liar the devil is a liar your best days are not behind you your best days are in front of you you say how can you say that amen because the Rapture is in front of us amen the future home is in front of us I often is in front of us amen prodal coming home is in front of us there's a resurrection of the dead and it's in front of us I don't listen to the devil I know what's in front of me the best days are in front of me therefore I'm not going to lay down and become castle with this devil I'm going to press forward hallelujah look what the scripture amen is promising you tonight when I speak of this pressing amen the pr of God said what we're doing is we are pressing into the Fulfillment let me say this these promises are not they're not Church promises amen listen you've heard all these things your whole lives amen they're not denominational promises these promises are scriptural promises going to possess them we've got to press into them Jesus said the time amen the kingdom of God is preached and every man amen presses into it look at this word pressive it means to use and apply Force so that tells me that there is something brother Austin in the kingdom of God that the devil don't want you to have amen there's something in front of you that the devil don't want you to possess so the way he's trying to stop you is by appearing big and appearing bad and appearing like he's this great old big devil amen but what if I told you amen that you are anointed Holy Ghost Amen to press against that liar and take your inheritance the Bible said I therefore so run amen not as uncertainly amen so fight I amen not as one amen that Beth the air so we are not fighting Flesh and Blood we are not fighting men or or or or visible creatures amen but we are fighting spirits come on church it's a spiritual warfare but look what Jesus said he said every man presses into it what did Brother REM say when he come back from Beyond the curtain of time he and scream press the battle come on Amen what word did he use press the battle listen because he knew there was a battle between the Church of the Living God and the curtain of time but he knew you was anointed he knew you had the sword in your hand you had the breastplate of righteousness you had your feet sh with the preparation of the Gospel you had the of Salvation listen Church you're in position tonight like no other generation Amen to fight this devil Hallelujah I feel like preaching there for a second no other generation has been put in position like you have Amen to fight this devil you don't have a half a sword you don't have a half a word got the full word you got the entire revelation of Jesus Christ in your possession I say and start F that devil and remember my my Hallelujah I'm talking about fighting against the devil you've been ordained to press this battle brother uses that Luke sermon he calls it desperation he said now look not just simply walked into it amen but it's got pressed into let me say this this desperation that he's speaking of actually causes you to press now let me say this this desperation Amen Brother John it's not a fearful or a begging desperation but it's a desperation with a sense of urgency like the prophet of God said see he said the law run till John okay but since then the Kingdom of Heaven has been preached somebody say preached and Men press into it he said now you don't just stand around take me up by the collar Lord and push me in no you press into it you get dead it's between life and death brother Joe it's between life and death now when brother R preaches desperations listen at his opening prayer I think it's amazing he says I want to speak on giving them courage to encourage them to given rights they have a right to Def that devil they have a right to defeat that devil listen he's already Defeated come on church to defeat him he's already defeated brother said he is just Bluff them he said but I claim them Father brother Thomas what was he claiming them for he was claiming them for the battle of the end time when the devil would stand between you and your children and between you and your health and between you and your sanity and between you and your Victory but God who is rich in Mercy said I will not allow that buff I will not allow that defeated being Amen to stand between my bride and her inheritance I'll send a prophet with the anointing to preach the word he'll preach the word preach of the word it will give them Faith listen what he says he said now help me to speak the word you speak through me Lord with the few notes I got wrote down here and the little scriptures wrote out he said I pray you'll help me Lord and get in the word and give them faith for the glory of God Amen he wrote some notes down and he wrote some scriptures down but then he invited the god of the word to come and get in the word and as he would say that word come on church he wasn't standing behind giving a political speech he was standing behind the pullit preaching the kingdom of God my goodness brother said see well as you speak to you say well brother BR as you speak to us my it serves the Lord he said you believe back and together we serve the Lord see it's the two of us together amen that makes the unit he said you know I used to work as electrician he said I find out could have a wire that's got plenty of current but it's not effective until it's grounded he said so when it's grounded then you get the result which is the current so we must have both parts of the wire Amen to make if there would ever be such a wonderful speaking and yet one to believe it come on don't matter how many notes Brother Brad or brother Thomas or any other preacher comes out here wonderful speaking it is ineffective until somebody begins to believe it he said but if there is so oh I love this he said if there's someone to believe it then comes real effective Hallelujah when you begin to hear the word preached and you begin to believe that word that word begins to become effective in your life he said we believe Lord I think it's a powerful thing amen that faith is what makes the word become real effective now Faith is the substance of things hoped for it's evidence of Things Not Seen listen for by it the elders obtained watch this and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear ream comes along in 1950 and says you testify of the things you do not see my goodness you testify of the things you do not see so you don't testify of what you see amen you testify of what you don't see but how hard is that because all you see is what you see am all you amen but somewhere sometime you got out of what you see and press by faith into the realities of the Unseen and then you begin to testify of seeing things that nobody else sees see because faith is the substance of things hope for it's the evidence of things you do not see he said faith is something amen that's born in you it's something that God gives you another place faith is Supernatural and it does Supernatural things he said the only spiritual faith will only recognize the word so when you've got the faith of God in your heart the only thing that faith will recognize is the word perfect Faith 1916 3 he said now we want to speak now upon faith and a different type of faith faith he said we're told in the Bible Faith come up by hearing now you cannot be saved without faith he is are y'all ready for this he said faith is something that you have to believe it's there you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but faith faith is believing something is there but rich man when nothing else will declare it's there when your see won't declare it when your feel won't declare it when you're hearing won't declare it when your memory and reason and conscience and affection when none of those things will declare it but faith is the super sense which is the six sense which is the Holy Ghost the faith of God and that dwells in you if you let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide and bring all the other five senses under control the super sense he said it's so far above the natural sense natural man is above the spiritual man as far as the heavens is above the natural man and his senses listen it makes you believe things that not see glory to God it makes you believe things that you cannot see see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about see the devil can get in those five senses and he can lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense it's far beyond his reach see that comes from God it's called Faith what is Faith it's an unseen Force it's a spirit and the Holy Spirit brings Faith let me say this faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen and Hebrews 11: 7 the bible says that by faith which that by faith means with confidence in God Amen his word by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet oh of things not seen as yet he moved with fear he prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith listen Noah by faith he moved with fear amen and seen listen Noah knew he was going to see you though what are you with me he knew he was going to see it couldn't it yet but he knew he was going to see it I got to studying that the other day looking the Amplified Bible I looked at that here that that that part of that verse that says things not seen in Amplified Bible listen at this translation it says events not yet seen events not yet seen I said oh thank you Jesus cuz we got two tapes called modern events are made clear by the prophecy listen if you have your heart the control of the six sense which is fa don't have to wait until you see the manifestation to begin to Rejoice but when you hear the prophecy or you hear the word there is something something that settles in your heart I don't know when I don't know how but I know it's going to take place I don't know when I don't know how but I know it's going to happen I stand like Noah I don't know yet but I know it's going to happen because God said so and I judge him faithful who said it I was out in California one time guy there he told me he said he said brother Andrew he said you want to see the driverless car I saidoh sure you know let's see it so he gets on his phone punches it in he said now what he'll do is this driverless car will come right by here and there'll be nobody in it it'll be a GPS it'll come right by here pick you up and take you where you want to go I said well getting in it I'm from the hills of East Tennessee if it ain't a Chevrolet pickup just let it go on down the road sorry all you so I'm standing there and brother Thomas man this guy's all half Happ you know he's off and finally he said well you just ain't excited are you I said well not really he said you mean brother Bram spoke of this and here it is and you're not rejoicing I said brother I've been rej heard the vision of it coming listen I don't wait to see the event before I start praising God but the minute the word is spoken the spirit of faith is in my heart I begin to believe God listen if it takes 5 years five minutes or five month it don't make no difference to a child of God I know in whom I have believed I'm going to press I'm going to press Bey on my feelings press beyond my ideas I'm going to press Beyond reasoning I'm going to believe God see what Noah did was he waited and he believed he moved fear and he built an ark he said don't criticize while the must have been crazy he said but yet there's no clouds ever come see before there was a cloud before there was a in the Skies Noah with the Unseen of the natural eye with his spiritual eye tuned with this spiritual eye tuned to the word of God he seen the rain falling brother he had never seen a cloud never never seen an ounce of moisture but he had his eye in tune with the word of God he said oh if we tonight in this Angeles Temple could so tune our hearts amen not our literal mind he said Let It Go cast down reasoning but with our hearts coed to the word of God to see a Revival Break Forth to see the altars to see the church packed to see the Revival spreading through Los anus amen a fire that can't be put out amen our hearts would begin to pulsate under the power of the Holy Ghost listen a prayer meeting that would move over Los Angeles tonight it have to happen he said certainly it would and when the church is in tune now can I preach to you for a minute people here tonight that's sick would begin to think is God and if he isn't then why serve him but if he's still God then he's still a Healer if he's almighty God he can do all things and if he made a promise he can not not break it Hallelujah he is almighty God can do all things and if he made a promise he can not break it listen what he said he said then that pulsation would begin to rise in your heart not your eyes it would begin to rise in your heart something's going to take place there could be nothing stop it it's a fire like a building on fire on a windy day it just keeps on blowing as the holy spir ends the fire listen and it'll keep on burning till it becomes a reality to you listen it may never become reality to your neighbor but if it ever becomes a reality to you it don't matter what the de it don't matter what the devil throws against you God who is rich in Mercy is able to keep his word listen I say it's time church amen to looking at things with our eyes and start looking at things with our hearts and believe God Is Bigger and God is better and God mightier and God is stronger listen I'm just going to preach for a second I believe my God still has the ability to break the unbre still has the ability Amen to move the unmovable he still has the ability Amen to perform miracles in the face of five senses because he's God and His word is true listen I refuse to take a defeat I refuse to lay down my sword and say well devil I gu you're right no sir that Devil's not right he's a liar and it's somebody remind him he is it's time somebody remind him he's a liar but our God is true he's the king of kings he's the Lord of lords what are you saying I'm saying it's by the word of faith that we press Paul said is is this okay he said the word is nigh thee it is even in thy mouth and in myy heart he said that is the word of faith which we preach look at this word preach it means to Proclaim brother Joe means to publish it means to tell something which has been done with the intent it can be done again oh brother if it's been done before it can be done again are you hearing me if it's been done before it can be done again when you begin to preach the word of faith you are saying if he's saved before he can save again if he healed before he can heal again come on I say it's time me to take the limits off of God I say it's time to remember God is he's not a man and he cannot lie to the man that he has to repent he's the old Mighty God and His word is true and his power is here his anointing is real I say take the limits off of God and watch the King of Kings come into action on the confession of the word of God hallelujah hallelujah it's time to confess something y'all [Applause] know y'all know brother Jewel down here know what but Jew says amen wowy wowy woe poor pitiful me it's time to change that confession it's time to say greater is he is his in than he that's in the world it's time to remind that devil you are a part of an unconditional Covenant and there is word that has been spoken over your life and heavens and earth shall pass away but my word it shall never it shall never it shall never [Applause] pass preach the word of faith Hallelujah preach the word said I love to see God heal his children certainly he said don't get me wrong he said one reason I've been noticing lately if you notice lately I've been trying everywhere I go when I get an invitation is to press in to PRI a little bit he said see I've let down on my preaching much on just anointing working on the Eternal part of the super natural he said rather that went to see Visions he said now those Visions wonderful and I thank God for it he said but yet the preaching of the word goodness the preaching of the word million miles beyond that amen when I see the lame walk and the blind see amen can I just go ahe and get it out there in the open just get it out there special preachers around that's got to touch you there ain't no special guys with some special gift and Oh Brother s brother so and so sees a vision brother so and so

autopsy checking something that's dead come on a if you if you having an all time see you're checking something that's dead and you know what I say my God is able to kill that God is able Amen to destroy every tumor my God is able to deliver our sister because He Still Remains the RFA he's still the Lord that Health all our diseases I refuse to believe that devil I refuse to believe his lies I'm going to believe Jehovah Hallelujah somebody say well somebody say well you lost your mind no I haven't because God send his word by anointed preachers he said how shall they hear and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how few how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring GL Tidings of good things all obey the gospel for Isaiah sayith Lord who believed I report come on church amen go read Isaiah 53 and the first verse it says who hath believed the report of the Lord that's a question right and then there's a next and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed took a prophet to come into this age and to rightly divide the word and say I know it looks like two questions but really it's a question and an answer if you believe the report of the Lord then the arm of the Lord shall be revealed to you and what is his AR his arm is his power his arm is his strength oh Church of the Living God lord Jesus say it on behalf of this church evening Light Fellowship believe your report Lord they believe your report they Isaiah 53 they believe Mark 16 they believe John 14 I say come on in the camp Lord and re feel your arm to every

Earth as God's servants that are sent on Earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you listen he sent anointed preachers direct quote to preach the word and you received it another place now Christ his ministers to preach the gospel just to have it returned to him void but he expects you to receive the word I love this last part and in receiving the he said be ready be ready be ready for the manifestation of the word that you received come on I think it's time to get me on the idea that we have a wait for hours or days or months brother I believe we're living in the season prayer request can become testimonies in the same service are you hearing me listen I don't think a prayer request has got to stay a prayer request I believe God can take a prayer request and can make it a testimony I've seen it with these eyes I've seen it with these eyes he say what are you talking about amen a few years ago a woman come up for prayer she said Andrew brother juw and I was there she said I want y'all to pray said my husband church he got called on God said he's out in the world said he's drinking our bills are piling up we're about to lose our home she said we need God to move we

thing shall not hurt them can I go ahead and read the rest of it they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's the word of God whose report are you going to believe I choose to believe the report of the Lord you say preacher why are you so preaching of the Gospel can I just tell you because the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil when you begin to preach gospel you begin to cast out the devil 1952 believe in God B says this he said God me the authority to break the power of Satan can I read you another one you in the same sermon you give us the divine power to break the power of Satan over this life in the name of Jesus Christ comes along and says this he says the only thing that kept me for can can we do battle for a minute the only thing that kept me from when I was 12 years old was because a spirit hung over me which was a devil that said wait a little while longer he said see a spirit that's the same with you you got with the wrong crowd and that hovered over you and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right there's not a man that's got his right mind but wants to do right but there's something that won't let you do right is that right he said that is the devil now I'm going to finish the quote but he commissioned his church to cast them out there you are in my name they cast out Devils listen you ain't going to heal nobody but you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept that I've all done he said preachers stood on the platform and they preached the gospel and the devil now come on Church the devil don't fight you to go to sleep in the song he don't fight you to go to sleep in the special when does the devil try to get you to doze out in la la land is when the word is being preached he said look he said the same thing by Divine Healing you said people here this morning you believe that have been born again are Sons and Daughters of God then Christ has alled you it's [Applause] all it's not going to be it's all thing that keeps you from being well this morning is is a spirit hanging over you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's done it that's right that's my commission that's what God gave me it's what he give every gospel preacher who will believe him are you ready for this the power and authority Spirit Well I'm just going to preach since I'm
