[13:00] unto the Lord all the Earth
[13:10] there is Glory among the Heathen his

[14:18] cometh for he cometh to judge the Earth
[14:21] he shall judge the world with
[14:23] righteousness and the people with his
[14:25] truth God bless you may be seated
[14:27] brother Brian
[14:33] thank you
[14:40] morning brothers and sisters
[14:42] if you would uh turn with me to
[14:48] uh Deuteronomy the 18th chapter
[14:51] I was just
[14:58] so after Wednesday when brother Daniel
[15:01] was talking I was hoping you all did
[15:03] your Bible study and found that friend
[15:05] that verse in Genesis about whether
[15:08] Isaac was bound or Unbound he was in a
[15:11] sneaky way it was making you do a Bible
[15:13] study so I hope y'all I'm not going to
[15:15] give you the answer you need to find the
[15:18] answer yourself you know preachers tell
[15:20] you they'll tell you all your life all
[15:23] the time you're sitting in it
[15:25] congregations you're obligated he's
[15:28] obligated to preach you the truth and
[15:30] teach you the truth but you're also
[15:32] obligated to go back to the word of God
[15:35] and have it vindicate to you it's got a
[15:37] It's gotta flashback to you that it's
[15:40] the truth and if you don't do that
[15:42] you're just believing what someone told
[15:44] you and a lot of times you're gonna find
[15:46] out coming short because you know as you
[15:48] pass information down the line by the
[15:51] time it gets to the end it's not the
[15:53] same thing that was heard in the
[15:55] beginning so you got to know and you got
[15:57] to know the truth but I was just
[15:59] thinking there was a lot of the
[16:02] ministers have been talking about a a
[16:04] lot of things that are going on in the
[16:06] world and I'm I'm not going to bring up
[16:08] it to property but even in the psalm we
[16:10] were just reading
[16:12] two examples were given that the psalm
[16:15] told you
[16:17] to be an example in front of the Heathen
[16:20] well that you are fulfilling that
[16:22] scripture today if you're a
[16:24] bible-believing message believing
[16:26] believer you are actually testifying to
[16:30] the heathing out there in the world that
[16:32] there is a better way and there is a
[16:34] difference between beating the eating
[16:36] and being a Believer but I was thinking
[16:38] that all the stuff that's going on in
[16:41] the schools and in the country
[16:43] you know it's all depravity but the real
[16:46] the property Satan's pretty crafty he's
[16:48] I mean he's been doing this for
[16:51] thousands of years and in this creation
[16:53] and he's been around I don't know how
[16:55] long
[16:56] but
[16:58] when you take children and you put
[17:01] images before them that they don't
[17:03] understand that image is going to be
[17:05] forever burned in their mind and in
[17:08] forever so if you give wrong pictures to
[17:11] your children and you give wrong
[17:13] examples to your children that's they're
[17:16] going to be possessed by them thoughts
[17:18] and those images as they grow up and
[17:20] that's the depravity of what's going on
[17:22] everyone knows it's not acceptable
[17:24] behavior but when you take those images
[17:26] and you burn them into the mind of young
[17:29] men and young women when they get to
[17:31] become our age or teenagers or young
[17:34] adults those images are gonna and if
[17:36] they don't have an experience where God
[17:39] takes those can take those out and put
[17:41] them in the sea of on his forgetfulness
[17:44] that's going to be a problem and what
[17:46] what they're starting now 10 years from
[17:48] now where is it going to be 10 or 15
[17:50] years from now you could talk about the
[17:52] depravity and everything that's going on
[17:54] you could you could list everything
[17:56] that's wrong but you you're getting into
[17:59] the weeds with and the truth is they're
[18:01] just they're taking a whole generation
[18:03] like brother Brown taught in his
[18:05] messages he goes back to the 30s and the
[18:07] 20s when things were starting to get
[18:09] loose then he goes through the 40s and
[18:12] World War II and his things get looser
[18:14] then you talk about the 60s the rock and
[18:17] roll music and all the depravity then
[18:19] now you get to 2023
[18:22] I mean there's no hope I mean everything
[18:25] is off kilter there's no foundation for
[18:27] anything anymore so if your hope is I'm
[18:30] not even on my point if y'all is in the
[18:32] things of this world then you're going
[18:34] to be sadly mistaken and I'll just read
[18:37] a I hope I found I didn't lose my spot
[18:40] here
[18:41] but um
[18:42] Moses is talking to the church
