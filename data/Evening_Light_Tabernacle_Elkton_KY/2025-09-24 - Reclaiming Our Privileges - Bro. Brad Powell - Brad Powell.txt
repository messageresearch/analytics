TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] He says, "Here it was." What was it? What was it? He said, "It was enforcing." We said, "Give it back." He said, "That's what we're talking about. Restore it. Bring it back to its rightful owner." Because Satan has robbed you of your privileges. &gt;&gt; He's here to do what? Steal, kill, destroy. We can never forget that. We can never say that enough because that identifies who our who our enemy is. And when we're fighting in this battle, we have to be able to not note and notify Satan. I'm not open for your games. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God. I have the right to enforce. I am a privileged person. Somebody say, I'm privileged. &gt;&gt; You are a privileged son and daughter of God. And we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim. Bring it back. He says, "So if you're afflicted, oh brothers and sisters, if you are afflicted, bring it back. &gt;&gt; Bring back my health, bring back my my my my body." If you have a right before God that you can say, "By his stripes, I am healed." Bring it back. Satan, bring it back. &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here depressed, tell Satan, "Satan, give it back. Give me back my joy." &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here unhappy, Satan, give me back my happiness. &gt;&gt; I'm sending a summon to you. &gt;&gt; Show up in court because I've got the best lawyer on the face of the earth. bring back what you've stole. Give me back my happiness. Restore the joy of my salvation. But we begin to see these things and the prophet tells us when we tell Satan to give it back. We're enforcing. He said it's it's to restore back to its natural condition. Now, I want you to listen to what he says. A man that is sick, a baby is sick, a woman is sick, they're out of their natural condition. God didn't make us to be sick. &gt;&gt; God's original plan was not for us to be sick, to have anxiety, to have fear, to have doubt. &gt;&gt; He didn't intend for any of that to happen. &gt;&gt; He said, "But so we have a right to enforce our claim. It's our claim because God gave it to us. By his stripes we're healed. He was wounded for our transgressions. With his stripes we're healed. He said, "Now we have to enforce that law." The lawgiver, the Holy Spirit himself is here, the agent of God to see that it is done. There is no reason for us, brothers and sisters, to go before the Lord in prayer and get a get sign a petition and summons it to the devil and then be afraid to deliver the paperwork. &gt;&gt; How many's got the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; What's he there for? The Holy Ghost is there as an agent to see that it's done, that it's a finished work. You say, "Well, you're just trying to pump us up." I'm not trying to pump you up. I'm telling you what the word says. I'm telling you what the prophet says. I'm telling you what the message of the hour restores us, too. &gt;&gt; This is a restoration message. He says, "Now, the only way that he can work, you want to know how to make this work? You want to know how to have your healing? You want to know how to have your deliverance? You want to know how to have your salvation? The only way to make this work is when you let him work. &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's not me. It's not me manufacturing. It's not me putting on. It's not me doing this or that. But it is when we allow God to work. And he says, "You got to believe it. &gt;&gt; You got to believe it with all your heart.
