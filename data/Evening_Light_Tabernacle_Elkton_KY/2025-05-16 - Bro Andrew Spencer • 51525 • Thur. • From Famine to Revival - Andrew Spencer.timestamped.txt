[10:29] You know, a fire in my bones. I I've
[10:31] been thinking about that. You know, I

[10:35] our Super Bowl we're going to kick off.
[10:37] We're going to get we're going to get
[10:38] excited tonight. You know, we're going

[11:05] got great anticipation and great
[11:07] expectations of what God might do. You
[11:10] know, me and me me and some brothers,
[11:12] we've been praying diligently, you know,
[11:14] tithing a little bit of our time, just
[11:16] praying for these meetings, you know,
[11:17] that God would come pour out another uh
[11:19] book of Acts tonight. You know, we're
[11:20] we're walking in Bible times right now.
[11:23] You know, we're living out the times.
[11:24] You know, he started the church in the
[11:26] book of Acts. He's and he's going to end
[11:28] it the same way he started it. So, what
[11:29] they had, we should have. And I'm
[11:31] praying for a double portion that God
[11:32] would come pour out the same thing that
[11:34] they had but with extreme measure
[11:36] because I'm extreme and I'm believing
[11:38] for extreme things. I want to go higher
[11:40] so higher than woo. Glory to God. I told
[11:43] you there's a fire in my bones. Glory to
[11:45] God. Let's just pray. Dear gracious
[11:48] heavenly father. Lord, we just want to
[11:50] call on your great name. Father, as we
[11:53] assemble ourselves together, Lord, we
[11:54] get in one mind, one accord, Lord, in
[11:56] the spirit of unity. Father, calling you
[11:58] on the scene, Lord God. We know that
[12:00] these ain't nothing but words on the
[12:02] paper, Lord, until you come and make
[12:03] them a reality in our life and come with
[12:05] power and demonstration in the
[12:07] manifestation of your word in our life.
[12:09] Oh God, we're longing for you to come.
[12:11] Lord Jesus, we're calling, Lord, that
[12:13] you would prick the hearts of the
[12:14] backslider, prick the hearts of the
[12:15] unbeliever. Lord, you see whatever have
[12:18] they they have need of, Father, whether
[12:19] they need healing, whether they need
[12:20] deliverance, whatever they have need of,
[12:22] whether they're here or out there
[12:24] online. Lord God, you see them all.
[12:26] Father, you see all of our friends and
[12:27] family. Lord, we pray, oh God, a special
[12:30] prayer over them. But Lord God, we're
[12:32] calling you down right now to walk the
[12:34] aisles of our heart. Lord, come minister
[12:36] to our heart. Lord, help us get out of
[12:38] the way, Father, and surrender a life to
[12:40] you that we can live another life with
[12:42] you through us, Lord, that we may see
[12:44] this life and see everything as you see
[12:46] it. Father, we pray you take all
[12:48] unbelief from our heart. Father, give us
[12:50] the eyes that, Father, we may see you,
[12:52] Father, and walk in the spirit and in
[12:54] truth as you are. For we know you're the
[12:56] truth, the life, and the way, Father. We
[12:58] can do nothing but what you can do
[13:00] through us, Lord, but we know we can do
[13:02] all things through you, Lord. So, we
[13:03] come with great expectations, Lord.
[13:05] We're asking you to come with a special
[13:07] outpouring tonight, Father, as we kick
[13:09] this off, Lord. But this revival,
[13:11] Father, is not just a revival to just
[13:13] come to a meeting, Father. It's a
[13:15] revival to stir the hearts of the people
[13:17] that we may go live a revived life
[13:19] daily. that we can be a burning pillar
[13:21] of fire in action around everybody we
[13:24] come in contact with, Lord. That it's
[13:26] you, God. It's nothing we did, but what
[13:28] you did. You're worthy to be lifted high
[13:30] enough, Lord. God, we love you. We want
[13:32] to praise you, God. We just love you so
[13:35] much, Father. We pray you just come
[13:37] anoint the congreg congregation, anoint
[13:39] the speaker, anoint the hearers, Lord,
[13:41] anoint the worship leaders, anoint the
[13:44] musicians, Lord, that we may have church
[13:46] tonight, Lord. We don't party. We don't
[13:48] do drugs. We don't do that. But we come
[13:49] to church. We come to see you. We come
[13:52] to hear from you. We come to feel you.
[13:54] We want a reality, Lord. Not just some
[13:56] uh uh words of uh man's wisdom, of
[13:59] enticing words of man's wisdom, but
[14:01] empower and demonstration, God. Lord
[14:04] God, that you may get all the glory and
[14:06] honor. Lord Jesus, we love you so much.
[14:09] We thank you, Lord. We we count it a
[14:11] privilege and honor to sit here and dine
[14:12] around the table, dying around the
[14:14] master table as you break this bread of
[14:16] life to us, oh God, and pour out your uh
[14:19] fountain of living water, oh God. We we
[14:21] know your word says the word of God is a
[14:24] seed. Father, we pray you go water the
[14:26] ground. We pray you water and it may
[14:28] grow up and and you said that you are
[14:30] the vine and we are the branches and we
[14:31] may bring more fruit for you, Lord.
[14:34] Lord, help us, oh God. We can do nothing
[14:36] without you, but we love you, oh God.
[14:38] We're just so grateful for you, Lord. We
[14:40] can't thank you enough. We pray you
[14:42] come, Lord Jesus, in Jesus name. Amen.
[14:47] Amen.
[14:53] Amen. Amen. We need to teach him to be a
[14:56] song leader. Amen. Amen. I I shouldn't
[14:59] say teach him. God can do anything.

[15:05] playing. Amen. and that he abides.
[15:09] Aren't you glad he abides
[15:11] tonight? That one verse says, "Once my
[15:15] heart was full of sin. Once I had no
[15:18] peace
[15:19] within but guess
[15:21] what? There's peace because why? He
[15:25] abides." Well, I'm rejoicing night and
[15:29] day as I walk this narrow way for the
[15:33] hand of God. And on my life I
[15:38] see and the reason of my bliss. Yes. The
[15:43] secret all is that the comforter abides
[15:49] with
[15:50] me. Well, here am I. Oh yes. Oh here
[15:57] abides. Well
[15:59] hallelujah. He abides with me.
[16:04] Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[16:08] walk this narrow way for the comforter
[16:13] abides with
[16:16] me. Now once my heart was full of sin.
[16:20] Once I had no peace within till I heard
[16:25] how Jesus died upon the tree.
[16:30] Then I knelt down at his feet and there
[16:34] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[16:39] abides with
[16:41] me. Well he
[16:44] abides. Oh he abides. Yeses. Oh
[16:49] halleluah. He abides with me.
[16:55] Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[16:59] walk this narrow way for the
[17:04] comforter with me. I like this verse. He
[17:08] is with me
[17:10] everywhere and he knows my every care.
[17:14] I'm as happy as a bird.
[17:18] Oh

[17:29] [Music]
[17:31] yes. Well, he
[17:35] abides. Oh, he
[17:38] abides. Well,
[17:40] hallelujah. He abides.
[17:45] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[17:50] this narrow way for the comforter abide
[17:55] with
[17:57] me. Now there's no thirsting for the
[18:00] things of this world. They've taken
[18:03] wings. Long ago I gave him up and
[18:10] instantly all my night was turned to
[18:13] day. All my burdens rolled away. Now the
[18:22] comforter. Well, he
[18:25] abides. Oh, he
[18:28] abides. Well,
[18:30] halleluah. He abides with thee.
[18:36] Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[18:40] walk this narrow way for the comforter
[18:45] abides with me.
[18:49] Amen.
[18:52] Amen. Amen. Aren't you glad he abides
[18:56] with you? Amen. You know, I was
[18:59] listening the prophet speak and he said,
[19:01] you know, we're sitting here tonight
[19:04] with sons and daughters of the king.
[19:06] Look next to you. It's not just brother
[19:09] Tommy or brother Thomas, but it's sons
[19:12] and daughters of the
[19:13] king. Do we have anything to do with it?
[19:16] No. But he abides in our heart and life
[19:19] tonight. Oh my.
[19:23] Amen. That almost would make an old
[19:25] message person shout, wouldn't it?
[19:27] Amen. Well, he is with me
[19:31] everywhere. And he knows my every care.
[19:35] I'm as happy as a bird and just as
[19:41] free. For the spirit has control. Jesus
[19:46] satisfies my soul since the comforter
[19:51] abides with me.
[19:54] Well, he
[19:56] abides. Oh, he
[20:00] abides. Well, hallelujah. He abides with
[20:06] me. Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as
[20:11] I walk this narrow way for the comforter
[20:16] abides with
[20:20] me. Amen. Well, this little light of

[21:41] shine. Amen. you love the Lord, shake
[21:45] your brother or sister's hand and you
[21:46] may be seated tonight. And God bless
[21:48] you. And and
[21:51] uh I can say I'm an old man. Brother
[21:54] Timothy told me tonight he said, "You're
[21:56] an old
[21:57] man." So I've known Brother Timothy
[22:00] since he was a wee little lad. He's not
[22:04] little and he's not a lad. But anyways,
[22:07] it's good to be in the house of the
[22:08] Lord, isn't it? And uh, Brother Carson,

[22:14] God's abiding peace is in my soul today.

[26:09] Caleb and brother Daniel and brother
[26:11] Michael John, would you come tonight?
[26:13] And Amen. We have some prayer requests
[26:15] tonight.
[26:16] And we have a sister in our church,
[26:19] Sister Parish, and she's in the hospital
[26:22] in Bowling Green, and she's having some
[26:25] issues. And she's a real
[26:28] soldier. The devil's tried everything he
[26:31] can do to destroy her, but she just
[26:33] keeps on
[26:34] fighting. And she never misses a
[26:36] service. She streams. God bless you,
[26:39] Sister Parish, tonight. And want to
[26:41] remember her in prayer tonight. and
[26:43] they've had to drain some more fluid off
[26:44] her stomach and they don't know where
[26:46] it's coming from or why. So, we want to
[26:49] remember her in prayer and also remember
[26:51] Sister Peggy, our other shut in, Sister
[26:53] Peggy Smith. And also, uh I've had quite
[26:57] an experience this week and I met a
[26:59] gentleman that I have dealt with on cars
[27:01] and his name is
[27:03] Josh. And uh he needs the Lord really
[27:06] bad. And I was telling brother Timothy,
[27:08] he's only told me three times he's
[27:10] agnostic, but he keeps asking me to pray
[27:12] for him. The the men's group here at the
[27:15] church has been praying for him. And and
[27:17] he he just he needs the Lord. And I told
[27:21] him, I said, "God's the only one that
[27:22] can take those memories. He's a a
[27:24] veteran from Afghanistan and Iraq, and
[27:28] he needs a touch from the Lord." And I
[27:29] told him, I said, "We're going to be
[27:30] praying for you."
[27:32] and he told me, he said, "I love you,
[27:35] buddy." And I thought, you know, he
[27:37] already thinks I'm crazy. I'd picked up
[27:40] a car from him. I said, "I'm going to
[27:41] pray for you." So, we just prayed for
[27:42] him out in the yard. He said, "Thank
[27:45] you." But just pray for Josh. He wants
[27:48] to come to church sometime. And we're
[27:50] just excited about him coming and and
[27:52] help us to live the life that he can see
[27:55] Jesus in us tonight. Isn't that your
[27:57] desire? He's just a super guy. And just
[28:00] remember him in your prayer. If you have
[28:01] need on your heart, you might let it be
[28:03] known to uplift his hand. And we're
[28:04] going to ask brother Joe Adams if he'll
[28:06] come. And you got a mic there for him.
[28:08] Oh, I do. I'm
[28:11] [Music]
[28:13] sorry. Thank you, brother Joe. Amen.
[28:16] Let's just take these knees to him this
[28:17] evening in prayer. If you got a need,
[28:18] just lift it up to the Lord. Father, we
[28:21] bow our hearts and our heads to you
[28:22] tonight. What a great privilege we have
[28:24] as your children to come in your place,
[28:26] Lord, your tabernacle to bring our our
[28:29] worship, Lord, our adoration and our
[28:31] praise unto thee tonight. Father, we
[28:33] worship you in spirit and in truth. And
[28:35] we, Lord, we're under great expectation,
[28:37] many hours. And Lord, prayers has gone
[28:40] forth for this meeting, this weekend.
[28:42] And Lord, we're just expecting a mighty
[28:44] move of the spirit of God. Lord, may you
[28:46] just move in every heart, every life,
[28:48] every uplifted hand tonight. Lord, the
[28:50] request that were mentioned, Father, the
[28:52] need for this, Brother Josh, Lord, we
[28:54] just pray it and in the name of Jesus
[28:55] tonight, you begin to soften down the
[28:58] walls of his heart, Lord, and may he see
[29:00] the reality of a living God, Lord, may
[29:02] it manifest it through Brother David and
[29:04] different ones that he would come in
[29:05] contact with. Lord, you see the sister
[29:07] in the hospital room, Lord, needing a
[29:09] touch of healing in her body. Lord, we
[29:11] believe that the redemptive blessings of
[29:13] Christ are all in past tense. It's a
[29:15] finished work. It's already been
[29:17] settled. It's already been done. And so,
[29:19] Father, tonight according to thy word,
[29:22] you said, "By my stripes, we are
[29:23] healed." Lord, we believe that not only
[29:25] for our sister, but each and everyone
[29:27] that's here tonight, you see their need.
[29:29] You see the need in their body, Lord.
[29:31] May it be a domestic need or whatever it
[29:33] may be tonight. Healing for their soul,
[29:35] healing for their body, deliverance. We
[29:38] believe it's already finished, Father.
[29:40] And we just set these weekend meetings
[29:42] aside, Lord, that the reality of a
[29:45] living God can come and be manifested in
[29:47] that heart and in that life. So we just
[29:49] commit the service to you. We ask that
[29:51] you'll bless the tithes and the
[29:52] offerings, those that can give and those
[29:54] that have not to give. Lord, may you
[29:56] just reward their efforts. Father, we
[29:58] love you. We commit this weekend, the
[30:00] service tonight, Brother Andrew, Lord,
[30:02] as he had studied and prepar and made
[30:04] preparations for the service. Use them
[30:06] in a special way, God. Lord, may you
[30:09] just pull your ministry off his notes,
[30:11] if it will, Lord, and be able to deal
[30:13] with one heart, one life, one soul. for
[30:16] your prophet taught us that one soul is
[30:18] worth 10,000 worlds. So, Father, deal
[30:20] with us each and every one individually.
[30:22] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[30:26] Brother Carson, could you pull up that
[30:27] song? I know I didn't have it wrote
[30:28] down. My hope is in the Lord because I
[30:31] definitely don't know the words. Let's
[30:33] sing that tonight if we could. My
[30:39] hope is in the Lord. Yes.
[30:43] From this time
[30:47] on and ever
[30:50] more, oh my
[30:54] hope is in the
[30:58] Lord forever
[31:02] more. Yes, I love this.
[31:07] I stand in awe within the presence of
[31:12] the Lord.
[31:15] In whom the wisdom of the
[31:19] ages
[31:21] lie. For whom the wrenching of the
[31:26] sea
[31:29] subside, the living
[31:33] sacrifice, the only
[31:35] source of life. Oh my
[31:40] hope is in the
[31:44] Lord from this time
[31:48] on and ever
[31:51] more. Oh my
[31:55] hope is in the
[31:59] Lord forever
[32:02] [Music]
[32:06] more. His tender mercies come with a
[32:11] free rising
[32:14] sun to meet the sinner in his
[32:20] [Music]
[32:21] brokenness to offer healing and
[32:25] forgiveness.
[32:30] And those who trust in him will find
[32:35] their
[32:36] hearts at rest. Oh, my
[32:40] hope is in the Lord.
[32:45] From this time
[32:48] on and ever
[32:51] more, all my
[32:55] hope is in the
[32:59] Lord forever more. Let's sing that
[33:03] second verse again, Brother
[33:06] Carson. His tender mercies come with
[33:11] every rising sun. Yes.
[33:15] to meet the sinner in his
[33:21] brokenness, to offer healing and
[33:26] [Music]
[33:29] forgiveness. And those who trust in him
[33:33] will find their hearts at rest. Oh yes,
[33:38] my
[33:40] hope is in the
[33:43] Lord from this time
[33:47] on forever
[33:50] more. Oh my
[33:54] hope is in the
[33:58] Lord forever more. Let's sing the chorus
[34:02] again as brother Winters comes to sing.
[34:04] Oh yes, my
[34:09] hope is in the
[34:12] Lord from this time
[34:18] on. God bless
[34:20] you. Oh my
[34:24] hope is in the
[34:27] Lord forever more. Sing that again now.
[34:33] My
[34:35] hope is in the
[34:38] Lord from this time
[34:43] on
[34:45] more. Oh my
[34:49] hope, it's in the
[34:53] Lord forever
[34:57] more. Amen.
[35:01] Brother
[35:02] Tommy, if we all came like you did, we'd

[40:32] That's exactly why we're here is because
[40:34] his mercy saw fit to place us in this
[40:38] moment in time. Well, God richly bless
[40:40] you. It's good to be here in the house

[41:59] Amen. How many has a need that you'd
[42:00] like to make known unto the Lord this
[42:02] this evening? Amen. God, meet each and
[42:05] every one of our needs here tonight.
[42:07] Let's just go to the Lord just now.
[42:09] Heavenly Father, Lord, we come before
[42:11] you, Lord, and we humble ourselves,
[42:13] Lord, in your presence, Father, and we
[42:15] invite you, Father, just now to come and
[42:18] minister to us, Lord. God, we have laid
[42:20] aside so many things, Father, for this
[42:23] meeting, Father. we've set aside
[42:24] ourselves, Lord. And we've put a put
[42:26] hours of prayer in for these meetings.
[42:28] And we're asking, Father, that the Holy
[42:31] Ghost would come and begin to minister
[42:33] unto us, Lord, by the preaching of the
[42:35] word, Father. Now, God, your people are
[42:37] gathered here. You, Lord, your presence
[42:39] has been felt. And Father, we just ask,
[42:42] Lord, that you would come and bless us
[42:44] with your presence, Father. God, we ask,
[42:47] Lord, that you'd move across this
[42:49] congregation, Father, tonight. and that
[42:51] you would begin to minister to them
[42:53] their needs, Lord. Their hands that they
[42:55] lifted up, Lord. God, you know exactly
[42:57] what they come to this meeting needing,
[42:59] Father. And I pray that you would do
[43:02] great things here amongst us, Father.
[43:04] Lord, that not man would be glorified,
[43:06] but that the Holy Ghost would come. You
[43:09] would be glorified in this meeting,
[43:11] Father. God, we dedicate this meeting to
[43:13] you, Father. And we ask, God, that you
[43:15] would just begin to move us in a very
[43:17] special way, God. move us aside and let
[43:19] the Holy Ghost have its way in this
[43:22] meeting. We yield oursel to the power of
[43:24] your word just now in Jesus Christ's
[43:26] name. Amen. And amen. If you have your
[43:29] Bibles this evening, we'd like to look
[43:32] over in the book of Joel chapter 2 verse
[43:35] 25 and then also down to Hosea chapter
[43:47] 6. Amen. Joel chapter 2 verse
[43:51] 25. Just like to minister to you
[43:54] something that the Lord's uh just
[43:55] inspired to our heart here um for these
[43:59] to open these meetings and um just like
[44:02] to minister from the preaching of the
[44:04] word here on from on the reading here
[44:06] from from these text on from famine to
[44:10] revival. From famine to revival. I love
[44:14] the book of Joel. It's so special to us
[44:17] because we realize that this is the hour
[44:19] that we're living in and and we begin to
[44:21] see some very beautiful things laid out
[44:23] here in the scripture. So, let's just
[44:25] let's just take that Joel chapter 2 and
[44:27] verse 25. And I will restore to you the
[44:31] years that the locust hath eaten, the
[44:34] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[44:36] palmer worm, my great army which I sent
[44:38] amongst you. And you shall eat in plenty
[44:41] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[44:44] the Lord your God that hath dwelt
[44:46] wondrously with you. And my people shall
[44:49] never be ashamed. And you shall know
[44:52] that I am in the midst of Israel, and
[44:54] that I am the Lord your God, and none
[44:57] else, and my people shall never be
[45:00] ashamed. And it shall come to pass
[45:02] afterwards that I will pour out my
[45:04] spirit upon all flesh. You notice what
[45:08] brother Brandham would he's not a Hebrew
[45:10] scholar but brother Brandham immediately
[45:11] goes in there and he starts breaking in
[45:14] going in there and breaking into Hebrew
[45:16] words and he starts looking in that
[45:18] pore. He said that word is not like what
[45:20] we would say in the English language. He
[45:22] said he said it was of itself that God
[45:25] said I will pour out my spirit. He said
[45:27] it wasn't something else. He said, but
[45:29] he was literally going to empty himself
[45:31] out that I will pour out my spirit upon
[45:35] all flesh, and your sons and your
[45:38] daughters shall prophesy, and your old
[45:40] men shall dream dreams, and your young
[45:42] men shall see visions. Hosea chapter 6
[45:47] and verse
[45:51] 1. The Bible says here, "Come and let us
[45:55] return unto the Lord, for he hath torn
[46:00] and he will heal us. He hath smitten and
[46:03] he will bind us up. After two days will
[46:07] he revive us. In the third day, he will
[46:10] raise us up and we shall live in his
[46:14] sight. Then shall we know, if we follow
[46:17] on to know the Lord, his going forth is
[46:20] prepared as the morning, and he shall
[46:22] come unto us as the rain. Maybe we could
[46:25] just say that together, that he shall
[46:27] come unto us as the rain, as the latter
[46:31] and former reign unto the earth. May God
[46:33] bless his word. You may be seated here
[46:35] tonight in the presence of the Lord. If
[46:38] you have your Bibles handy, we just like
[46:39] to look over into Ruth chapter 1 just to
[46:42] gather a context for this this meeting
[46:44] here tonight. The Bible says in Ruth 1:1
[46:47] that it came to pass that in the days
[46:50] when the judges ruled that there was a
[46:52] famine in the land and a certain man of
[46:55] Bethlehem Judah was sent was went to
[46:58] sojourn in the country of Moab. and he
[47:01] and his wife and his two sons. And the
[47:04] name of the man was IMC, and the name of
[47:06] his wife was Naomi. And the name of his
[47:09] two sons, Melon and Chilion, the
[47:11] Ephrithites of Bethlehem Judah. And they
[47:14] came into the country of Moab, and
[47:16] continued there. Let's just jump down
[47:18] there to verse 22. And the Bible said
[47:20] that, "So Naomi returned and Ruth the
[47:24] Moabitis, her daughter-in-law with her,
[47:27] which returned out of the country of
[47:29] Moab. and they came to Bethlehem in the
[47:32] beginning of barley harvest. And it's
[47:35] very powerful to recognize the season
[47:37] that Naomi and Ruth begin to enter back
[47:40] into Naomi's homeland again. It was at
[47:42] the beginning of barley harvest. Now,
[47:44] brother Brandham lays in some very
[47:46] powerful things when you begin to look
[47:48] into the Smyrnian church age. You begin
[47:50] to see there that brother Brandham
[47:52] captures the the what the spirit is
[47:54] saying unto each of the church ages. He
[47:57] goes in there and he grabs that. He that
[47:59] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[48:00] spirit saith unto the churches of each
[48:02] age. He said, in every age, it was the
[48:04] same cry. Hear what the spirit says. If
[48:08] you are a Christian, you will get back
[48:09] to what the spirit is teaching. That is
[48:12] the word of this age. Every messenger to
[48:15] every age will preach that word. Every
[48:17] fresh and true revival will because
[48:20] because men have gotten back to the word
[48:23] for their age. The cry of every age is
[48:26] the rebuke. You have left the word of
[48:28] God. Repent and come back to the word.
[48:31] From the first book in the Bible,
[48:32] Genesis to the last book of Revelation,
[48:35] there is only one reason for God's
[48:37] displeasure. Notice, there's only one
[48:39] reason for God's displeasure, and that's
[48:42] leaving the word. And there's only one
[48:44] remedy to regain his favor is back to
[48:47] the word of God. And I believe that if
[48:49] we're going to gain favor with anybody,
[48:51] it's to gain favor with Almighty God.
[48:54] And I I believe that if we're ever going
[48:56] to find oursel in favor with the Holy
[48:58] Ghost, it is to come back to the word of
[49:01] this hour. And we realize that what we
[49:04] have been given in this hour is a
[49:06] special word. It's not something that
[49:08] that we take for granted, but we realize
[49:10] that God has deposited something in this
[49:12] generation. Now, when Jesus is standing
[49:15] there in Matthew chapter 5, he begins to
[49:17] release some very powerful scriptures
[49:19] that we were very familiar with in the
[49:21] biatitudes. But Jesus said, "Blessed are
[49:24] they that do hunger and thirst after
[49:27] righteousness, for they shall be
[49:29] filled." And I I really find that that
[49:31] is the cry for the hour, especially for
[49:34] the bride of Jesus Christ, is that she
[49:36] is hungering and she is thirsting, not
[49:38] just for a day gone by, revival, but a
[49:41] revival of a fresh kill, of a fresh word
[49:44] of of the hour. We realize that this
[49:46] bride is kind of like the queen of the
[49:48] south that came up there and she heard
[49:50] that there was a Solomon that was doing
[49:52] mighty works and she'd got there under
[49:54] that atmosphere and she'd heard about
[49:56] those things and she was hungering in
[49:58] her heart to go out there and find if
[50:00] there was a living God out there. And I
[50:02] say this that desire will bring a
[50:05] revival. I believe that if you're
[50:07] wanting something from Almighty God,
[50:09] you've got to get into a spirit of
[50:11] revival where you begin to yearn for a
[50:13] move of God. And I believe that if
[50:15] you're yearning for a move of God, then
[50:17] only a move of God will satisfy your
[50:19] soul. I don't believe that it's
[50:21] something that we have to wish that we
[50:23] was back in the days of William Brham or
[50:25] in the days of Paul or in the days of
[50:28] Arinius, but I believe that right now
[50:30] that even right now in this place that
[50:32] the Holy Ghost could come and he could
[50:34] minister unto us. And it takes the
[50:37] spirit of the living God to release that
[50:39] unto you and I. And I believe this that
[50:42] if you come to this meeting expecting
[50:44] certain things if you come here the
[50:46] prophet would teach us. He said if you
[50:48] come here and the enemy would begin to
[50:50] put something on you that you'll
[50:52] criticize. You'll begin to criticize. If
[50:54] you come here to criticize, he said
[50:56] surely the devil will show you plenty to
[50:58] criticize. He said if you come here to
[51:01] find fault, then the enemy will show you
[51:03] plenty things to find fault with. He
[51:06] said, "But if you come here hungering
[51:07] and thirsting for God, then the angels
[51:10] of God will direct you to the spot to
[51:12] find it." And I believe that if you come
[51:14] here hungering after a move of God, then
[51:17] it won't be a minister that does it. It
[51:19] won't be a man that does. It won't be a
[51:21] pastor that does it. But the angels of
[51:24] God will direct you to the word. They
[51:26] will direct you to the spot where the
[51:28] angels of God can let you come to a spot
[51:31] where the blessings of God could flow in
[51:33] this place. Now the prophet preaches in
[51:37] 1965 on the thought of thirst and he
[51:40] begins to lay in some things. He said
[51:42] now if you neglect to feed the Holy
[51:44] Spirit, the word of God, he said Jesus
[51:46] said every word shall be by the Holy
[51:49] Spirit. He said if you try to feed the
[51:52] wrong thing, he said if it's a genuine
[51:54] Holy Spirit, it'll know the difference.
[51:57] If you tried to feed the Holy Ghost that
[51:59] you have something off of this message,
[52:02] it'll know the difference. He said
[52:04] because remember the word of God is what
[52:06] the Holy Spirit feeds on.
[52:09] He said it doesn't feed on enthusiasm.
[52:12] It doesn't feed it doesn't feed on
[52:14] education and it doesn't feed on
[52:16] churchgoing. It does not feed on the
[52:19] theologies. Come on somebody. So if
[52:21] you're going to feed the Holy Ghost on
[52:23] the inside of you, you can't feed it
[52:25] some watered down gospel. But you've got
[52:27] to feed it the message of the hour
[52:30] because what you have been given is
[52:32] greater than Pentecost of Isuza ever
[52:35] had.
[52:37] Come on, somebody. You've got to feed it
[52:39] on the message of the hour. So if you're
[52:42] going to feed your soul, you've got to
[52:44] feed on the message. You've got to feed
[52:46] on this word. You got to stay in it.
[52:48] Because we realize that the prophet said
[52:50] in Amos chapter 8 and 11 that there was
[52:53] coming a time there would be a famine in
[52:55] the land and it wouldn't be for food and
[52:57] it wouldn't be for drink but it would be
[52:59] for the word of God and men would seek
[53:01] to and fro and they wouldn't find that
[53:04] word. And the prophet would sit there
[53:06] and he would lay out some very
[53:08] fundamental things. He said you can look
[53:10] at America. America is not lacking for
[53:12] food. America is not lacking for water.
[53:15] He said, "But what she is lacking is the
[53:18] word of God." And the prophet taught us
[53:21] the reason why that she's in this
[53:23] condition is because sin and unbelief
[53:26] and false teachers have come in there
[53:28] with modernistic ideas.
[53:31] So what she's given him is a watered
[53:33] down revival.
[53:36] Hallelujah. But I'm so thankful to know
[53:38] tonight that you are not in the midst of
[53:40] a rev of a famine. I'm so thankful to
[53:43] know that you are in the midst of the
[53:45] greatest revival that has ever struck
[53:48] the face of the earth. So when the world
[53:50] is in famine, when the word can't when
[53:53] the world can't find the word of God,
[53:55] there is a people who under their
[53:57] messenger who will be the final voice of
[54:00] the final age that knows who she is,
[54:03] knows what she's called for. She is not
[54:05] in famine, but she's in the midst of a
[54:08] revival.
[54:11] Hallelujah. Come on, church. You're not
[54:13] in the midst of a famine. You're not
[54:15] trying to find where the word of God is.
[54:17] You have found it and it's in the
[54:19] message.
[54:24] Hallelujah.
[54:27] Hallelujah. And we realize we realize
[54:30] that only that a Jew can only be blessed
[54:34] when they stay in that land. Is that
[54:36] right? that a Jew every single time that
[54:39] they begin to get outside of what God
[54:41] give them, outside of their inheritance,
[54:43] that you'll find them that they begin to
[54:46] get away from what the commandments,
[54:47] they'll begin to get away and they'll
[54:49] never be blessed as long as they're
[54:51] outside of their land. And you find that
[54:54] Naomi, she begin to wander and she be to
[54:57] look because there was a famine. Because
[55:00] there was a famine that was on that land
[55:02] and she began to wander out there and
[55:04] she went all the way. her and her family
[55:06] had went all the way out there to Moab.
[55:08] And I find it amazing that the prophet
[55:10] said, "Now Naomi would not have had to
[55:12] do that. She didn't have to do that
[55:14] because she was living in Bethlehem,
[55:16] which is the house of God's bread."
[55:19] Because God is a God that restores. And
[55:21] if he's going to do anything, it's got
[55:24] to come right through his word that he's
[55:27] got scripture that's going to be
[55:28] fulfilled. But I love this message.
[55:31] Don't you? I love this message. He said,
[55:33] "But the prophet said that all of a
[55:36] sudden something begin to lead Naomi."
[55:39] He said, "That's what makes a difference
[55:41] is that when God has ordained something,
[55:43] then it's got to be." He said, "She
[55:45] didn't have to go out there." He said,
[55:47] "Because God is the God of Bethlehem.
[55:49] He's the house of God's bread." He said,
[55:52] "But if God has ordained something to
[55:55] be," he said, "then it'll happen
[55:58] anyway." So you see that there is
[56:01] predestination that when you was out in
[56:03] the world and you was going away from
[56:05] God, God had a purpose.
[56:09] The rest of the world didn't catch this
[56:11] message. But God ordained you. He
[56:14] elected you. And it didn't look like
[56:16] Naomi should have went out there. It
[56:18] didn't look like she should have went
[56:19] out there to Moab. But God had a plan
[56:22] because he had a gentile wife that had
[56:25] to come to the Lord of the harvest. And
[56:29] you may not understand why you went
[56:31] through the battles that you went
[56:32] through and why you went through the
[56:34] trials that you went through, but if God
[56:36] has ordained it,
[56:38] [Applause]
[56:38] [Music]
[56:40] [Applause]
[56:42] hallelujah. So God allowed a famine to
[56:46] strike so that he could bring in the
[56:49] elect lady.
[56:54] Lord have mercy. That's preaching
[56:56] grounds. I wish I was a
[56:59] preacher. Come on
[57:01] now. So God allowed a famine to strike
[57:05] this world so that he could get you when
[57:08] it looked like they really had
[57:10] something. when the shock looked like
[57:12] they really had something. But there was
[57:14] a gene seed of God on the inside of you.
[57:18] So he had to send a prophet that knew
[57:20] how to sew the right kind of a seed and
[57:23] I sew it and water it. Hallelujah.
[57:28] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[57:31] begin to look what Hosea begin to say
[57:34] there in chapter 6. Brother Brandham
[57:37] dives into that very heavily in Hosea
[57:40] chapter 6 and recognizing your day and
[57:42] its message. It's good to see you, sis.
[57:44] God bless you. Brother Brandham goes in
[57:47] there and he goes in there and he begins
[57:49] to tie those he begins to tie those
[57:51] things together in recognizing your day
[57:53] and its message and he picks that up. He
[57:55] said after two days after two days he
[57:57] would return to them and he will revive
[58:00] us. Brother said now that revive doesn't
[58:03] mean resurrection. He said revive is the
[58:06] same word used anywhere else. He said I
[58:09] looked it up to see what it means. He
[58:11] said it means a revival. He revives us
[58:14] after two days but in the third day he
[58:17] will revive us again. After all the Jews
[58:21] had been through after all the Jews that
[58:24] they have done. They they had walked
[58:26] away from God. They had left the message
[58:28] of the hour. They had been real close
[58:31] but they walked away from God. But
[58:33] you'll never find God turning his back
[58:36] on Israel because Israel was the apple
[58:39] of his eye. Is that right? She is the
[58:42] apple of his eye. But God always said
[58:46] that she's my beloved. So God was going
[58:49] to take care of his bride that after two
[58:53] days that I will revive you again. And
[58:57] the prophet said, "The Jews have been
[58:59] dead to the facts that the church of the
[59:01] living God as in a Pentecostal feast,
[59:06] but in the third day, he will revive us
[59:09] again for the first time in 2700 years.
[59:13] You will find that Israel is back in her
[59:16] homeland. It's the first time that you
[59:18] see that she has her national flag
[59:21] flying high and she doesn't have to hide
[59:24] from it. She doesn't have to be ashamed
[59:26] of it, but she's put there back in the
[59:29] mat. She don't even know how she got
[59:31] back there. She don't even know how she
[59:34] got in the message church, but something
[59:38] greater than
[59:39] herself, something greater than her
[59:42] humanity begin to put her back in
[59:46] there. The prophet said, "National force
[59:49] put her back in her homeland." He said,
[59:52] "National force will put the world
[59:54] council in the churches again." He said,
[59:56] "But the power of God will put the
[59:59] people in the
[1:00:02] bride." Hallelujah. It wasn't your daddy
[1:00:05] that put you in the message. It wasn't
[1:00:07] your pastor that put you in the message,
[1:00:09] but it was the
[1:00:10] power. The power. How did you get to
[1:00:13] Kentucky? How did you get to believing
[1:00:15] in a seventh angel? How did you get
[1:00:17] here? The power of God.
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:22] Hallelujah.
[1:00:25] Young people, that ought to give you
[1:00:26] some
[1:00:28] encouragement. That ought to give you
[1:00:29] some encouragement. Your granddaddy
[1:00:31] didn't birth you in this message. Your
[1:00:33] mama didn't birth you in this message.
[1:00:35] Your granddaddy didn't birth you in this
[1:00:37] message. But the power of God saw that
[1:00:40] you were
[1:00:42] not. The power of God knew that you
[1:00:45] wouldn't walk away. But there was
[1:00:47] something on the inside of
[1:00:49] you in the midst of a famine. He was
[1:00:53] going to see a people that would be in
[1:00:56] revival.
[1:01:00] You see, it was
[1:01:01] prophesied that there would be a
[1:01:03] gathering.
[1:01:05] Now, okay, they didn't want to go back
[1:01:07] there. But because prophecy was laying
[1:01:10] there, they didn't want to get on. They
[1:01:13] didn't want to get on that airplane. But
[1:01:15] they there be to be a man that knew the
[1:01:17] scripture and said, "Don't you know that
[1:01:20] we'll ride on the wings of an eagle back
[1:01:23] to our homeland? Don't you know that
[1:01:26] this bride is riding on the wings of an
[1:01:29] eagle
[1:01:31] anointing?" And it's not taking her back
[1:01:34] to days gone by. But it's simply come up
[1:01:36] here. Come up higher. Come up higher.
[1:01:40] Under this eagle anointing, you were
[1:01:42] built to
[1:01:45] soar. The bride has recognized the
[1:01:49] evening
[1:01:51] light. The prophet said, "The hungry
[1:01:53] Pentecostals have be to recognize that
[1:01:56] organizations hasn't got anything they
[1:01:59] was looking for." He said, "They're so
[1:02:01] twisted up and tore up." He said, "See,
[1:02:03] it's time of recognition. You got to
[1:02:05] recognize. The world has recognized.
[1:02:08] Nations has recognized. Science has
[1:02:11] recognized. The devil has recognized."
[1:02:14] He said, "It's a time." The devil's
[1:02:16] recognized. It's time that he can wreck
[1:02:18] up women, wreck up the church, wreck up
[1:02:21] people. The devil's recognized that. How
[1:02:24] many can be a witness that the devil has
[1:02:26] recognized that this is his time?
[1:02:30] I want you to know God didn't leave you
[1:02:31] down here in Lelaya without
[1:02:33] help. Come on, somebody. You might be
[1:02:36] like Lazarus, but you are not without
[1:02:38] help. Because there is a man, it might
[1:02:41] look like he's late, but he's right on
[1:02:44] time. It may look like he's not coming,
[1:02:46] but he's right on time. You might feel
[1:02:49] like you ain't been in
[1:02:51] revival, but he's right on time.
[1:02:55] The devil's recognized this is his time.
[1:02:58] And God has
[1:03:00] recognized that there is a people on the
[1:03:02] earth that he has predestinated to life.
[1:03:05] He's recognized this is the time to send
[1:03:08] his
[1:03:10] message. Hallelujah. What is it? He
[1:03:14] couldn't send it. He couldn't send it
[1:03:16] before Pentecost. He couldn't send it in
[1:03:18] Luther's day. Why? Because you wasn't
[1:03:21] here yet.
[1:03:23] Let me say this. You was not
[1:03:25] predestinated to believe Luther's
[1:03:27] message.
[1:03:30] Yes, you're going to believe some of
[1:03:31] what Luther preached. Yes, there's going
[1:03:33] to be some things that you gather from
[1:03:34] Wesley. But you were ordained, come on,
[1:03:37] somebody to go higher than the Isuza
[1:03:40] Pentecost of 1906 because God ordained
[1:03:43] you for a special kind of message that
[1:03:46] would take you further than what you
[1:03:48] could ever imagine. So the message is
[1:03:51] the answer. You are ordained to come
[1:03:55] under a
[1:03:56] prophet that would tie up what Luther
[1:03:59] said, what Wesley said. Those things
[1:04:02] were lost. But all of a sudden, a
[1:04:05] Kentucky
[1:04:07] hillbilly, a Kentucky hillbilly grabbed
[1:04:10] a hold of an anointing that would tie up
[1:04:13] these loose ends to give you rapture
[1:04:16] anointing.
[1:04:19] No other time. Let me ask you this.
[1:04:22] There ain't been no other time. I I've
[1:04:23] studied the message. I've studied
[1:04:25] scriptures. I've studied history.
[1:04:27] There's never been a time where there
[1:04:30] there have been some great men. And I'm
[1:04:31] not I'm not neglecting the fact that
[1:04:33] we've had some great men stand in this
[1:04:36] nation. Men like Oil Jagger, men like or
[1:04:39] Roberts, men like TL Osbborne, men like
[1:04:42] Billy Graham. But there's never one of
[1:04:44] them that could say they had a
[1:04:46] conference with an
[1:04:48] angel. Never there ever was there one
[1:04:51] that could say they went back on the
[1:04:52] back side of a desert because the spirit
[1:04:54] of God was leading them to to go back
[1:04:56] there to find something that would
[1:04:58] anoint you in this hour. And I find it
[1:05:01] amazing young people that while he is
[1:05:04] there the angel of the Lord begins to
[1:05:06] minister to him and he begins to tell
[1:05:08] him you go listen to the message.
[1:05:10] Brother Brandham said that that angel
[1:05:12] begin to speak to him especially about
[1:05:15] the young people. So it means that you
[1:05:18] young people are special to the angel of
[1:05:21] the Lord.
[1:05:23] Not ever has there been any
[1:05:26] man with the ending of ham to be able to
[1:05:30] stand there and preach a message that
[1:05:32] would restore our faith. But in this
[1:05:35] hour and in this time because there is a
[1:05:40] preparation because there's a people
[1:05:42] that are hungering. I'll be honest. I'll
[1:05:46] be honest. There's a lot of things that
[1:05:47] you could go out into the world and you
[1:05:49] could look at and it might please your
[1:05:52] flesh, but it'll never satisfy what God
[1:05:56] has put on the inside of you that you
[1:05:58] have been hungering for. I'll say the
[1:06:01] message is the only thing that'll feed
[1:06:03] you.
[1:06:05] The message is the only thing that'll
[1:06:07] feed you. And the prophet said that his
[1:06:09] children, a hungry child, will eat of a
[1:06:12] out of a garbage can if they have to.
[1:06:15] But I'm so glad you don't have
[1:06:18] to. He said the reason why they do that
[1:06:21] is because they've never been invited to
[1:06:24] a clean table. But this message has
[1:06:27] invited you to come up here where you're
[1:06:29] eating at the table of the Lord. And
[1:06:32] you're not feeding on the mind of a man,
[1:06:34] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:06:37] word of the son of man. Hal hallelujah.
[1:06:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're not in
[1:06:44] famine. You're in revival.
[1:06:48] Come on, Elijah. You ain't got to wish
[1:06:50] that somebody would come by and feed
[1:06:52] you. He sent angel porters.
[1:06:57] with spiritual food in due season to
[1:07:01] come by your way and drop off heavenly
[1:07:06] mana. What was it? Hidden truths in a
[1:07:10] certain season. What did he tell him in
[1:07:13] first Kings 17 and4 said that I will
[1:07:17] feed you there.
[1:07:19] Don't you go outside of this message,
[1:07:21] Ruth. Don't you get outside of this
[1:07:23] message, but I'll feed you right there.
[1:07:24] Elijah, I'll feed you right there. You
[1:07:27] stay right there. You feed on this. What
[1:07:30] was it? He had he had himself a
[1:07:35] revival when the rest of the world was
[1:07:38] in
[1:07:38] famine. Why? Because Elijah Because
[1:07:42] Elijah knew that there was an angel that
[1:07:46] was taking care of him. I'd say that in
[1:07:48] this place that angels have been
[1:07:51] anointing you to come to this spot to
[1:07:54] come to this place. I'd say if you need
[1:07:56] healing, you come to the right spot. I'd
[1:07:59] say if you need deliverance, you come to
[1:08:01] the right spot. I'd say if you need the
[1:08:03] Holy Ghost, you come to the right spot.
[1:08:05] How did I get here? The angel. The
[1:08:07] angel. The angel. The
[1:08:12] angel. Hallelujah.
[1:08:15] It ain't just good for William and
[1:08:16] Brandon. It ain't just for days gone by.
[1:08:19] But I need my miracle.
[1:08:21] I need I need I need
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:28] deliverance. I'd say he's got need to go
[1:08:30] by your
[1:08:32] way. He had the need to go by Samaria.
[1:08:36] He had the need for a colt the fo of an
[1:08:38] ass. I'd say the Lord's got need of your
[1:08:40] vessel. I'd say the Lord's got need of
[1:08:42] your vessel. And you may have fallen. I
[1:08:45] said, "Get back
[1:08:47] up. Nobody loves me. Get back up."
[1:08:50] That's a lie. Nobody's for me. Get back
[1:08:53] up. That's a lie. This message has never
[1:08:56] Hallelujah.
[1:08:58] This message has never condemned you.
[1:09:00] But it simply begin to raise you higher
[1:09:03] and higher and higher. Why? Because God
[1:09:06] said that I will
[1:09:10] restore. I will restore. not something
[1:09:12] different, but I'll take what was broken
[1:09:15] and I'll mend it back together. You
[1:09:18] don't know what I've been through,
[1:09:19] Brother Andrew. You don't know the
[1:09:20] hurts. I said, "The Lord's got me to
[1:09:22] you." I said, "The Lord's got me need
[1:09:24] to." You don't know the struggles that
[1:09:25] I've been in, brother. I said, "The
[1:09:27] Lord's got me to you." You might feel
[1:09:29] like you're unworthy. Kind of like
[1:09:33] Rahab. Now, I'd say Rahab has more scars
[1:09:35] than anybody in this
[1:09:37] building. I say, "But when the message
[1:09:39] comes by your way,
[1:09:42] I say when the message comes by your
[1:09:44] way, when you got some preachers come by
[1:09:47] your way to tell you, you're not too
[1:09:49] scarred up for this
[1:09:51] message. You're not too broken for this
[1:09:54] message, for I will restore. You think
[1:09:57] about it. The prophet said that Rahab
[1:10:00] was sold into that line of
[1:10:04] work. Is okay here? That she was sold
[1:10:07] into that line of work by her mother and
[1:10:10] father. Tradition tells us that they
[1:10:13] sold her right into the midst of that
[1:10:16] line of work. But when the message,
[1:10:19] Brother Brad, but when the message come
[1:10:22] by her way, I tell you what he did. The
[1:10:24] message restored her. Her parents had
[1:10:28] hurt her. There was people that abused
[1:10:30] her. But who was the first ones that
[1:10:33] Rahab wanted to get in her house? Her
[1:10:36] mama and her daddy. You might have been
[1:10:39] scarred or abused.
[1:10:42] You might have been scarred or abused by
[1:10:44] a preacher, but I say the message has
[1:10:48] the ability to
[1:10:52] restore Rahab. Get them in the house.
[1:10:56] Get them. Get them in the house. Full
[1:11:00] obedience entitles you to the token.
[1:11:06] Get them in this message.
[1:11:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:15] And you watch when Naomi begins to
[1:11:17] return
[1:11:19] back. When does she return? She returns
[1:11:23] when God is beginning to lift that
[1:11:26] plague. And he begins to say that
[1:11:29] there's spiritual food in due season.
[1:11:30] And it's a time that God's given back
[1:11:33] bread. Then notice that Naomi shows up.
[1:11:38] I say it matters where you show up at. I
[1:11:40] say it matters what season that you show
[1:11:42] up
[1:11:43] in. She didn't just show up at any time,
[1:11:46] but she showed up at barley harvest. The
[1:11:49] thing she was lacking was the thing she
[1:11:51] came back for. You might have walked out
[1:11:53] on this message, but I say the message
[1:11:55] is the only thing that's worth walking
[1:11:57] back to. Don't you walk back to the
[1:11:59] world. Don't you walk back to drugs.
[1:12:01] Don't you walk back to Leosa. But if
[1:12:03] you're going to walk, you walk back to
[1:12:05] this
[1:12:06] message. How powerful is it that she
[1:12:08] showed up at the right
[1:12:11] season at barley harvest? What was it?
[1:12:16] It was a time of the first fruits. It
[1:12:20] was a time of the first fruits. It was a
[1:12:22] time of Pentecost, of first fruits, that
[1:12:26] it was a time when they would go in
[1:12:28] there and the owner of the field would
[1:12:31] take the first one that had come to
[1:12:34] maturity. He would go there and he would
[1:12:36] take his wave sheep offering and he
[1:12:38] would lift it up to the Lord and the
[1:12:40] Lord, the priest would begin to wave it
[1:12:44] before the congregation. Come on, Tommy.
[1:12:47] Come on now. He began to wave it across
[1:12:50] the congregation. And what was he doing?
[1:12:53] It was a sign that one like this,
[1:12:57] there's more
[1:12:58] coming. When Jesus Christ was rose up on
[1:13:02] Easter morning, he be to wave himself on
[1:13:06] the day of Pentecost that it was a sign
[1:13:09] that there was more just like
[1:13:12] him. More just like him. Not somebody
[1:13:15] that could do half the work, but the
[1:13:17] works that I do shall you do also. You
[1:13:20] don't have to wish. You don't have to
[1:13:22] want. You don't have to lack. But you're
[1:13:25] in it.
[1:13:26] What are you saying, brother Angel? I'm
[1:13:28] simply saying this, step in the water.
[1:13:31] The angel
[1:13:33] is here.
[1:13:38] And know Naomi had seen seasons
[1:13:40] before. And you know what it's like,
[1:13:42] brother Tom. You're a pastor. You see
[1:13:45] seasons come and you see seasons of
[1:13:46] revival
[1:13:48] come. Are you with me? You see seasons
[1:13:50] of revival come. You see, I'll just be
[1:13:52] honest in an atmosphere of healing
[1:13:54] comes. And you get in that season of
[1:13:56] healing. There's a season where the
[1:13:58] waters are stirred. I say it's a time to
[1:14:01] step in it. But Naomi had seen seasons
[1:14:04] of harvest before. She'd been there. She
[1:14:06] she'd been there. She'd seen a a great
[1:14:08] mighty move of the Holy Ghost like time
[1:14:11] and time before. And it's ever if you
[1:14:13] ever been surfing, now I ain't never
[1:14:15] been surfing. I'm too much a hillbilly
[1:14:16] to go surfing. But if you ever watch
[1:14:18] somebody surfing, I was just in New
[1:14:20] Zealand. They got some powerful surfers
[1:14:22] over. They got some big waves. They
[1:14:24] bigger waves than our ponds produce in
[1:14:26] Virginia. And they they riding these
[1:14:28] waves. But if you've ever if you ever
[1:14:30] watch somebody on a wave, they know how
[1:14:32] to time it just right so they can ride
[1:14:35] the wave. And if you're a real spiritual
[1:14:37] believer, you know when the wave's
[1:14:39] coming. So you simply just get in it. So
[1:14:41] you begin to ride the wave of the Holy
[1:14:44] Ghost, but there's coming an end of that
[1:14:47] wave. Is that right? So Naomi had
[1:14:49] watched seasons of harvest before, but
[1:14:53] she was getting ready to go into a
[1:14:54] season that she'd never experienced like
[1:14:57] this before because she'd watched people
[1:14:59] come and she watched people go to this
[1:15:01] message and turn down the message. But
[1:15:03] she's getting ready. Hallelujah. She's
[1:15:06] getting ready to be restored by the
[1:15:09] owner of the field.
[1:15:11] And if you marry to the owner of the
[1:15:14] field, you don't have to worry if it's
[1:15:16] in season or out of season. You're
[1:15:19] all you are always in season because the
[1:15:24] owner of the field has
[1:15:27] access. I say he's got access to the
[1:15:29] Holy Ghost. He's got access to
[1:15:31] deliverance. He's got access to
[1:15:33] breakthroughs. He's got access to
[1:15:35] miracles. I say in the name of the Lord,
[1:15:37] he's got access
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:44] What are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[1:15:45] saying this that a revival signifies a
[1:15:49] move of the Holy Spirit. That's what a
[1:15:53] revival
[1:15:54] is. It's a moving of the Holy Ghost. In
[1:15:57] plain words, that's how the prophet said
[1:15:59] it. It's a moving of the Holy Ghost. He
[1:16:02] said, "But you watch that every single
[1:16:04] time that God sends a revival that hell
[1:16:06] sends one, too." He said many people
[1:16:09] don't realize that in the Welsh revival
[1:16:11] in the great day of the Welsh revival
[1:16:13] that they had the outpourings of the
[1:16:14] Holy Ghost. There was great
[1:16:16] ministrations of the spirit. He said but
[1:16:18] at the same time the insane asylums was
[1:16:21] fueling up at the same time. Brother
[1:16:24] Brandham said it was for this reason
[1:16:26] that the devil would steal the attention
[1:16:28] of
[1:16:29] God. That's the power of the enemy that
[1:16:33] you're fighting. We have seen under the
[1:16:35] seven church ages every form of revival
[1:16:38] and death. And you watch the cycle of it
[1:16:41] as it comes and goes. But this is not a
[1:16:45] man-made revival.
[1:16:48] I want you to know this that you are not
[1:16:50] a part of a man-made revival. But you
[1:16:54] are a part of the Holy Ghost bride
[1:16:57] revival of this last day that only
[1:17:00] Almighty God would restore.
[1:17:03] You watch when when the book of Joel,
[1:17:05] you just go begin to look at it. Now,
[1:17:07] it's a it's one of my favorite
[1:17:09] scriptures because it it means something
[1:17:11] to us in this age that you begin to
[1:17:14] watch as the prophet goes and I always
[1:17:16] found it amazing. The prophet said, I he
[1:17:18] said, I went home after the Easter
[1:17:19] morning service and wrote down a couple
[1:17:20] notes and he comes out and preaches a
[1:17:22] three-hour service on restoration of
[1:17:24] brier. I'd like to have him notes.
[1:17:26] Wouldn't
[1:17:27] you? Yeah. I say that's pretty good. You
[1:17:30] watch it. Brother Man comes in there and
[1:17:31] you watch what he does in the
[1:17:33] restoration of the brier. He goes in
[1:17:35] there and he begins to layer out what
[1:17:37] these four bugs are going to do that
[1:17:38] they're going to come in and they eat.
[1:17:40] And it's very simple when you begin to
[1:17:42] listen to it. I love a message that it's
[1:17:44] very simple that brother Brandon begins
[1:17:46] to recognize what them bugs was. It was
[1:17:49] that Catholicism system that was eating
[1:17:52] the revival or the moving of the Holy
[1:17:55] Spirit. And you watch what it did. That
[1:17:57] system began to eat the power of
[1:17:59] religion. The power of the Holy Ghost,
[1:18:02] miracles, we begin to taken out of the
[1:18:04] church. The truth of water baptism was
[1:18:06] taken out of the church. The truth of
[1:18:08] healing, the laying hands on the sick
[1:18:10] was taken out of the church. The truth
[1:18:13] of deliverance was taken away from the
[1:18:15] church. But God said that I will
[1:18:21] restore. Well, you say, "Well, I don't
[1:18:23] need a miracle. Sister Donna needs a
[1:18:25] miracle. Brother Ron needs a miracle.
[1:18:27] And I'll be honest, I need a miracle.
[1:18:30] I'd say that if you're in this hour and
[1:18:32] you have been told, hallelujah, you've
[1:18:34] been told that God doesn't heal no more,
[1:18:36] I am here as proof that God
[1:18:39] heals. If you have been told that God
[1:18:42] don't give the Holy Ghost no more, I
[1:18:44] showed up to prove that devil a
[1:18:47] liar. If you are here and you are in
[1:18:50] need of deliverance, I showed up in this
[1:18:52] meeting just to prove that God still
[1:18:55] delivers. Ain't nobody worse than what I
[1:18:58] was. Ain't nobody worse than what Tommy
[1:19:00] was. But God is a God that
[1:19:06] restores. Tell the devil he has showed
[1:19:09] up too
[1:19:10] late. You ain't going to stop me. You
[1:19:13] ain't going to stop this message. You're
[1:19:15] not going to stop this power because God
[1:19:18] said,
[1:19:19] "I
[1:19:21] will restore." Amen.
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:25] I love David said in Psalms chapter 1,
[1:19:30] "Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:19:34] the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
[1:19:36] in the way of the sinners, nor setth in
[1:19:38] the city of the
[1:19:40] scornful, but his delight is in the law
[1:19:44] of the Lord. And in his law does he
[1:19:48] meditate day and night." Now, you begin
[1:19:50] to study that word meditate. It's
[1:19:52] powerful.
[1:19:53] It it doesn't mean like what you would
[1:19:54] see is the common day modern ideas
[1:19:58] of some yoga dude
[1:20:00] meditating. But the word means to
[1:20:03] roar. It means to roar. Literally roar
[1:20:06] out. It means to speak out. Roar. In his
[1:20:11] law does he meditate. So there's coming
[1:20:14] a time when you're going to have to
[1:20:16] prophesy again. You've got to let out a
[1:20:19] roar. You got to let out a roar. Are you
[1:20:22] with me? And I I find it amazing what
[1:20:24] David said in verse three that he shall
[1:20:27] be like a tree planted by the rivers
[1:20:30] plural of water singular that bringeth
[1:20:33] forth his fruit in season and his leaf
[1:20:37] also shall not wither and whatsoever he
[1:20:40] doeth shall he prosper. You notice that
[1:20:43] when when in the Garden of Eden that God
[1:20:46] plants two trees there in the Garden of
[1:20:49] Eden and you watch when Adam and Eve
[1:20:51] begin to make their decision and they
[1:20:53] went out there and they fell because of
[1:20:56] sin begin to enter in and they needed
[1:20:59] access to that tree. So when brother
[1:21:02] sees them, he sees them in vision form.
[1:21:05] He sees Eve with her beautiful blonde
[1:21:08] hair walking out and that lamb skin
[1:21:11] beating against their legs. Brother
[1:21:14] Brandham is not just telling you what he
[1:21:16] thinks. He is looking at it. And they
[1:21:19] had lost access to that
[1:21:22] tree. But do you realize that that is
[1:21:25] what he planted on the day of Pentecost?
[1:21:29] He planted that tree. Not another tree,
[1:21:32] but he planted that same tree. You see,
[1:21:36] they lost their access to it. They lost
[1:21:39] their access to it. And brother Madam
[1:21:41] said, he said those angels, those
[1:21:43] cherubams were standing there at the
[1:21:45] gate of Eden and they was blocking them.
[1:21:48] They was keeping them from entering back
[1:21:50] into Eden.
[1:21:54] But an angel stood in this generation
[1:21:56] and said, "But them angels are in this
[1:21:59] hour are ushering you to
[1:22:02] run to run back into that place where
[1:22:07] the tree has been planted." What are you
[1:22:10] saying, brother Andrew? That where if
[1:22:12] you plant a tree beside a river, it
[1:22:15] begins to grow. If you've ever spent
[1:22:17] some time by a river, and I appreciate
[1:22:19] you taking me by that river today,
[1:22:20] Brother Tom, it blessed me so good. You
[1:22:23] ever watch a tree that's ever planted by
[1:22:24] a river? It begins to stick its roots
[1:22:27] all the way out where the source is. It
[1:22:30] sticks it all the way out there because
[1:22:33] he realizes that he's going to have to
[1:22:35] live by it. He's got to live by that.
[1:22:38] And I think it's amazing that when God
[1:22:40] plants you somewhere, he don't plant you
[1:22:45] somewhere where you have to live in dry
[1:22:47] spells.
[1:22:49] He ain't going to plant you somewhere
[1:22:51] you going have to wonder when the next
[1:22:53] revival's coming. He ain't going to
[1:22:55] plant you somewhere where you think,
[1:22:56] "Well, I wish I was in this church or I
[1:22:58] wish I was in in Brother Tim's church or
[1:23:00] brother Donny's church." But you can
[1:23:02] have a revival every single day of your
[1:23:04] life because it matters where you're
[1:23:06] planted at. I say you ain't got to wish
[1:23:08] to be at Brother Ron's church and you
[1:23:10] ain't got a wish to be at Brother
[1:23:12] Brandham's meetings. And I say right
[1:23:14] here, right now under the message of the
[1:23:17] hour that you ought to be living in a
[1:23:19] state of revival.
[1:23:22] I'm I dealt with somebody overseas one
[1:23:24] time said, "I wish that I could have
[1:23:26] what you have. I I see you. I watch
[1:23:29] you." I said, "Sis, you ain't got to
[1:23:31] wish for it. You can have it right now.
[1:23:35] You ain't got to wait for a preacher to
[1:23:37] come. You ain't got to wait for some
[1:23:39] anointed evangelist to come through. You
[1:23:42] ought to be living in revival at all
[1:23:44] times.
[1:23:50] Hallelujah. See, God knew what he put on
[1:23:52] the inside of you so he had confidence
[1:23:54] to plant you in the darkest of ages that
[1:23:57] he could stand right here in the midst
[1:23:59] of it all and you could live off the
[1:24:02] rain.
[1:24:04] I tell you what, there's a lot of
[1:24:06] people, they don't like rain. I tell you
[1:24:09] what, my I love the
[1:24:12] rain. I love the rain. You ever You ever
[1:24:16] get out there inside outside in a good
[1:24:19] rainstorm? I've been around some people
[1:24:21] need to get out in
[1:24:22] it. Need to wash that stink off of them
[1:24:24] a few times. You know what I'm
[1:24:26] saying? I love a good rain. I love a
[1:24:29] good rain. You get out there in it. I
[1:24:31] tell you, it's beautiful. When you get
[1:24:33] out there in the midst of it, you don't
[1:24:34] have to you don't have to sit there and
[1:24:36] you don't have to wonder where it's
[1:24:37] coming from. you know exactly where it's
[1:24:39] coming from. I say this that you don't
[1:24:42] have to wonder when is the next move of
[1:24:45] God coming. I'd say you're in it. I say
[1:24:48] you ain't got to wish for you ain't got
[1:24:49] to wish for something but you're right
[1:24:51] here in it. And the bride tree has been
[1:24:54] planted in living waters. The prophet
[1:24:57] come and he preached. He said," he said,
[1:24:59] "I'm I'm either going to preach to you.
[1:25:00] I'm either going to preach to you broken
[1:25:02] sisters or I'm going to preach to you
[1:25:04] that sow to a whirlwind or or reap a
[1:25:07] whirlwind." I'm so glad that he preached
[1:25:09] on broken sisters because a prophet
[1:25:12] began to stand there and he preached
[1:25:13] some very powerful things and he called
[1:25:16] out the denomination says, "What you've
[1:25:18] got is leaking sistns and your sistns
[1:25:21] ain't got nothing but a bunch of wicked
[1:25:23] tails in it. It ain't got nothing but a
[1:25:24] stagnant pool of water in there."
[1:25:27] He said but you watch. He said that RT
[1:25:30] is in well he said that broken s or that
[1:25:33] sister. He said it is depending on local
[1:25:36] revivals. It's depending on local rains.
[1:25:39] He said but that artisian well where the
[1:25:41] bride of Jesus Christ has been planted.
[1:25:44] He said it's something on the inside
[1:25:47] that keeps bubbling up. It keeps it
[1:25:49] pure. It keeps it satisfied. It's
[1:25:52] self-supporting. It's fresh. It's clean.
[1:25:54] It's an artisian whale, fountain of
[1:25:57] living water. It's not dead. It's not
[1:25:59] stagnated, but it's living. Constantly
[1:26:02] changing and bringing up something new
[1:26:05] all the time, moving on, coming from its
[1:26:08] resource.
[1:26:11] Where are you getting fed at? You tell
[1:26:14] me you ain't been in revival, I say,
[1:26:16] where you feeding at. Where's your
[1:26:18] source at? He said, "If I had that kind
[1:26:21] of a stirring like brother Tommy's got
[1:26:23] or brother Tom's got or brother Joe's
[1:26:25] got, I'd really get excited about the
[1:26:27] word." I say, "What you been feeding
[1:26:29] on?"
[1:26:32] Well, I've always wanted the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:33] What are you feeding on? I've always
[1:26:36] wanted a chance at the spirit of God
[1:26:37] moving on my What are you feeding on?
[1:26:40] Because if you feed on this message,
[1:26:42] it'll tell you that you have a fresh
[1:26:44] chance at the word of God every single
[1:26:47] day of your life.
[1:26:49] [Applause]
[1:26:56] You see, when Jesus comes in there and
[1:26:59] he starts laying out in the new new
[1:27:01] birth chapter, he begins to come all the
[1:27:03] way down there and he begins to say,
[1:27:04] "Now, the spirit of God was given to me
[1:27:07] without
[1:27:09] measure." They said, "But to you it is
[1:27:12] given with measure." You see, so it's
[1:27:15] showing you that you're feeding from the
[1:27:18] same
[1:27:20] source that Christ had. So if I would
[1:27:23] take this bottle of water right here,
[1:27:26] this is the source, and I would pour it
[1:27:28] out to brother Brad and pour it out to
[1:27:30] brother Joe, they could say that they've
[1:27:32] got a resource from the source itself.
[1:27:35] So you young people and you people that
[1:27:37] sit here and anybody that hears this,
[1:27:39] you don't have to wish that you could
[1:27:41] have the same thing. Because if you've
[1:27:43] got the Holy Ghost that I've got, you
[1:27:46] got the same power that'll produce
[1:27:48] miracles. You got the same power that's
[1:27:50] feeding from a fountain that doesn't run
[1:27:53] dry. I say that what you've got a hold
[1:27:55] of is the same power that anointed
[1:27:57] Elijah to stand up there in front of 850
[1:28:01] prophets, false prophets up there. It's
[1:28:03] the same power that anointed Jesus to
[1:28:05] stand there and withstand the religious
[1:28:08] leaders. I'd say what you're anointed
[1:28:10] with is the same power that anointed
[1:28:12] Moses to stretch out his rod and walk
[1:28:15] over on dry ground. You're anointed with
[1:28:17] the same power that anointed Jesus to
[1:28:20] walk on water. What you're anointed with
[1:28:22] is the same power that kept Daniel in a
[1:28:25] lion's den. What are you saying, brother
[1:28:28] Andrew? I'm saying you're anointed with
[1:28:29] the same power that was on Paul and
[1:28:32] Silas that kept them alive in a prison
[1:28:35] so that they could worship in a way of
[1:28:37] freedom. It was the same kind of
[1:28:39] anointing that was on them that got them
[1:28:41] out of their prison cells.
[1:28:46] This rain ain't going to be
[1:28:49] stopped for I will restore unto you. You
[1:28:54] know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:28:56] "Now," he said, "Now the former rain or
[1:28:59] the latter rain couldn't come till the
[1:29:01] former rain came." So, he couldn't give
[1:29:04] you the harvest rain until he gave you
[1:29:07] the teaching rain. Brother Brandham ties
[1:29:10] it together that the latter rain is
[1:29:13] rapturing faith. And you could not have
[1:29:17] rapturing faith until the teaching rain
[1:29:20] had been poured out. Now you watch it
[1:29:23] that I I always think it amazing like
[1:29:25] how in the world at least it's that way
[1:29:27] in Virginia that you got your weeds and
[1:29:29] you got your tears out there. They grow
[1:29:31] so much faster. It seems like they have
[1:29:33] a spot of progression that they begin to
[1:29:35] go into a place of advancement. But you
[1:29:38] know what they're feeding off? They're
[1:29:39] feeding off the same rain that waters a
[1:29:42] true genuine seed.
[1:29:46] And it's amazing. You can watch them
[1:29:48] Pentecostals get excited about the rain.
[1:29:51] You can watch them. They get so excited
[1:29:53] because of the rain. They're rejoicing
[1:29:55] over top of your rain. They're rejoicing
[1:29:58] over your rain. I say if they can
[1:30:00] rejoice over the rain and get excited
[1:30:03] about the rain and they can shout about
[1:30:05] the rain and they can dance in the rain,
[1:30:08] they can speak in the rain. I'd say that
[1:30:10] the bride of Jesus Christ has got every
[1:30:14] right. Every right. I'd say if you want
[1:30:17] to dance, dance and rain.
[1:30:21] I'd say if you want to shout, shout in
[1:30:24] the rain. I'd say if you want to sing,
[1:30:26] sing in the rain
[1:30:28] because it is a harvest rain, a
[1:30:31] rapturing rain.
[1:30:38] When Ruth come to her time of decision,
[1:30:41] she didn't know she didn't know what was
[1:30:44] what was going on. She didn't know why
[1:30:46] she was being pulled to go with Naomi.
[1:30:49] It was a lot easier for her to go back
[1:30:51] to Moabitous
[1:30:53] ways. I'll be honest, there's, let's
[1:30:56] just be honest, according to the flesh,
[1:30:58] there's a lot of things
[1:30:59] easier to go back to than it is to go
[1:31:02] forward in this
[1:31:04] message. But we are not of those that
[1:31:07] turn back.
[1:31:09] Come on. Or is going to do her thing.
[1:31:11] She's going to kiss Naomi and she's
[1:31:13] going to walk back and turn back. But
[1:31:15] you ain't made up like that way. You can
[1:31:18] let everybody say what they want to, but
[1:31:20] you know what you you know what's been
[1:31:22] calling you. It was a lot easier for you
[1:31:24] to go back there and live in the
[1:31:25] pleasures of life again under the flesh
[1:31:27] of sin. But because God deposited a gene
[1:31:32] seed of God on the inside of you, you
[1:31:34] couldn't go back with Ruth. You couldn't
[1:31:36] go back with Orpa because Ruth had a
[1:31:39] different destination. All right. Come
[1:31:42] on. The prophet said that there was
[1:31:44] something leading her. Redemption was
[1:31:48] leading her. I'd say that election is
[1:31:51] what's leading you to this. It's leading
[1:31:53] you to this revival. And you see so many
[1:31:56] people that have a chance at it and they
[1:32:00] turn it down. And you wonder why they
[1:32:03] turn down the moving of the spirit of
[1:32:05] God.
[1:32:07] You look
[1:32:08] at I just let me just lay some things
[1:32:11] right here. I'm sorry I'm here, but I'm
[1:32:13] here. But you look at you look at the
[1:32:16] Kardashians out there in the world and
[1:32:19] you look at the sin that they got on
[1:32:21] their
[1:32:22] life. You think, "Well, man, if they if
[1:32:24] they ever had a chance at the message,
[1:32:26] it might do something for them." You
[1:32:27] know, they had their chance. They had
[1:32:30] their chance. their grandfather, brother
[1:32:32] Shakarian, sat right beside the prophet
[1:32:35] and watched the moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:37] and he turned it down for money and and
[1:32:40] because he wanted a meal ticket, they
[1:32:43] had their chance at it. And you see
[1:32:45] where it took them. You turn down this
[1:32:47] message, you watch what'll happen to
[1:32:49] your life. Let me say this to you. They
[1:32:53] might have more money than you, but they
[1:32:55] can never replace what you've got on the
[1:32:57] inside of you. What God has deposited on
[1:33:00] the inside of you is greater than all
[1:33:03] the world can ever
[1:33:05] offer. What are you saying? I'm saying
[1:33:08] surrender to the power of this
[1:33:13] message. Brother Man said, "Now in the
[1:33:16] third seal," he said, "Now the bride has
[1:33:18] not had her revival yet." He said, "It's
[1:33:21] going to take them seven unknown
[1:33:22] thunders back there to wake her up." But
[1:33:24] he comes in recognizing his day and its
[1:33:26] message. He said, "Now, I love them
[1:33:28] people that produce that magazine of of
[1:33:31] the Herald of Faith, of the Herald of
[1:33:32] his coming." He said, "But you watch,
[1:33:34] all that they produce is fast and pray,
[1:33:36] sound the trumpet, fast and pray." He
[1:33:39] said, "It's because they have not
[1:33:41] watched or recognized the awakening of
[1:33:44] the bride."
[1:33:45] This bride has been woke up to the fact
[1:33:49] that God's not dead. She's been woke up
[1:33:52] to the fact that seven seals have been
[1:33:55] released. She's been woke up to the fact
[1:33:58] that the bridegroom has come to fill his
[1:34:02] bride with the same power, same
[1:34:05] anointing. I've been woke up and I can't
[1:34:09] go back to
[1:34:10] sleep. I've been woke up. You ain't
[1:34:13] rocking me back to
[1:34:15] sleep. You ain't going to rock me back
[1:34:17] to sleep with Leotaa. I've been woke up.
[1:34:21] The message woke me up to the fact that
[1:34:24] all power in heaven and earth is in you.
[1:34:30] Ain't no wonder hell hates this revival.
[1:34:33] Ain't no wonder hell wants to keep you
[1:34:35] away from it.
[1:34:39] Because he watched it there in heaven
[1:34:41] and he couldn't have it. He watched it
[1:34:43] in the Garden of Eden and he can't have
[1:34:45] it. And I say it again, brother. He's
[1:34:47] watching in Satan's Eden and he cannot
[1:34:50] have
[1:34:52] it. What he give me is for
[1:34:55] me. I say it ain't just for William
[1:34:58] Brandham. It ain't just for brother Tom
[1:35:00] Balor. It ain't just for brother Tim. It
[1:35:02] ain't just for Ron Spencer Andrew
[1:35:04] Spencer. I say for every
[1:35:06] mama. I'd say every young girl. I'd say
[1:35:09] every daddy. I'd say don't miss your
[1:35:13] opportunity. Come on, Ruth. Wake up.
[1:35:18] You have been elected to come.
[1:35:23] I'm going I'm going to read one more
[1:35:24] quote to
[1:35:28] you. Hallelujah. My y'all fun to preach
[1:35:33] to. Lord have
[1:35:35] mercy. It's just the first night. Praise
[1:35:37] God. We going to have a time in this
[1:35:40] place. Ain't no wonder hell hates you.
[1:35:43] Ain't no wonder hell wants to stop you.
[1:35:45] The power that is in this room is more
[1:35:48] than he could ever have.
[1:35:53] He'll never get a glimpse of it. He'll
[1:35:55] never have a handle on
[1:35:57] it. He ain't nothing but a bluff anyway.
[1:36:01] He ain't got no power. That's why he's
[1:36:03] trying to keep you from it. That's why
[1:36:05] it's trying to stop the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:36:07] because he
[1:36:09] knows once you get it, he ain't getting
[1:36:12] you back.
[1:36:15] He knew that once Joshua got in the
[1:36:18] promised land, there was no way he was
[1:36:20] getting him out of it.
[1:36:23] I'd say the devil knew that when you got
[1:36:25] in this message, he
[1:36:27] knew, brother Troy, he tried to keep you
[1:36:30] away from it. But God rich in mercy. God
[1:36:33] rich in mercy. He tried to keep you from
[1:36:36] power. He tried to keep you from truth.
[1:36:38] But God rich in mercy.
[1:36:42] God rich in mercy. Satan tried his best,
[1:36:47] but God rich in
[1:36:52] mercy. I said, "Give me more. Give me
[1:36:55] more. Give me more."
[1:36:58] [Applause]
[1:37:08] And Ruth began to wander out. She went
[1:37:12] by that church and it didn't have
[1:37:14] nothing for her. She went by that field
[1:37:17] and it didn't have nothing for her. She
[1:37:18] went by the church of Christ and it
[1:37:20] didn't have nothing for her. But all of
[1:37:22] a sudden something led her led her right
[1:37:24] to this
[1:37:25] message because there was something
[1:37:27] there that she didn't even even see on
[1:37:29] the surface. It went to the depths of it
[1:37:32] and she be to watch the witness of the
[1:37:33] Holy Ghost moving her. She didn't know
[1:37:36] why she was drawn to this field.
[1:37:39] She didn't know why she was drawn to
[1:37:40] that church. She didn't know why she was
[1:37:42] drawn to
[1:37:43] that. Something was on the inside of
[1:37:46] her.
[1:37:49] And when the man of wealth stepped into
[1:37:52] the
[1:37:54] message,
[1:37:56] hallelujah. When Elijah stood here said,
[1:37:59] "It ain't for them, but it's for you."
[1:38:03] They wondered at it. They guessed at it,
[1:38:06] but it's for you.
[1:38:08] He said, "I'll no longer call you
[1:38:10] church, but I'm going to call you
[1:38:11] bride." So you understand, Ruth, that
[1:38:13] I'm talking to you. I ain't talking to
[1:38:15] the rest of the girls out there, but I'm
[1:38:17] talking to you. I'm talking directly to
[1:38:19] you. I'm speak I'm spending my time with
[1:38:21] you. There's a lot of other ladies out
[1:38:23] there. There's a lot of other people.
[1:38:25] There's a lot of other churches out
[1:38:26] there, but Elohem is going to spend some
[1:38:29] time with you while you're hearing this
[1:38:30] message. While you're here in this
[1:38:32] field, I'm going to spend some time with
[1:38:34] you. I got to minister some things to
[1:38:35] you that you're not going to have to
[1:38:37] barely get
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:47] by.
[1:38:48] Hallelujah. Brother said this. He said,
[1:38:51] "She's out there. She's gleaning for
[1:38:54] life." He said, "Now I want you
[1:38:57] reapers, you angels." In other
[1:39:00] words, that's what they are. said, "I
[1:39:03] want you angels, you reapers, every once
[1:39:06] in a while, drop a handful on purpose."
[1:39:14] He said, "Don't let it be tiresome for
[1:39:18] her. Don't let her wonder at it. Don't
[1:39:22] let her guess where her next meal's
[1:39:23] coming from. Don't let her guess when
[1:39:25] the next revival's coming. Don't let her
[1:39:28] guess when the next move is coming.
[1:39:29] Don't let it be tiresome for her. But
[1:39:32] every once in a while, let her hear a
[1:39:34] good gospel message. Let a good power of
[1:39:37] the Holy Spirit cover over her every
[1:39:40] once in a while and let her know that
[1:39:42] I'm still
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:44] here. Do some kind of a healing amongst
[1:39:47] her. Show some kind of a sign or a
[1:39:51] wonder that she'll know that I'm in her
[1:39:56] midst.
[1:39:59] Hallelujah.
[1:40:01] Let her know I'm in her midst.
[1:40:06] Let me ask you a
[1:40:08] question. How many has witnessed the
[1:40:12] healing power of Jesus Christ? Just just
[1:40:15] he let her know that I'm in her midst.
[1:40:20] How many can
[1:40:21] 100% identify that they have received
[1:40:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost?
[1:40:28] Let her know that I'm in her midst.
[1:40:32] Keep your hands up. Let her know that
[1:40:35] I'm in her midst. Now, you that are
[1:40:38] looking for it, look right there. You
[1:40:41] that are wondering for it, look right
[1:40:42] there. Let her know that I am in her
[1:40:46] midst.
[1:40:48] What other sign do you need? Come on,
[1:40:50] man. What other Anybody here witnessed a
[1:40:55] miracle? Go ahead, Tommy. stand
[1:40:59] up. Let every miracle, every miracle in
[1:41:01] this place, stand up right
[1:41:03] now. Let her know that I am in her
[1:41:11] midst. You ain't got to wish that
[1:41:13] William Brandon was still here. Let her
[1:41:15] know that El Shi, the great breasted
[1:41:19] one, is right here in her
[1:41:23] midst. Draw from both sides.
[1:41:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let her know
[1:41:30] that I am in her
[1:41:36] midst. The prophet said, "Do you like to
[1:41:40] find them
[1:41:41] handfuls?" I hope we find some this
[1:41:44] morning. He said, "A handful of fresh
[1:41:46] barley." The Lord do something that he
[1:41:48] used to do, something that he knows he
[1:41:50] does. He's the Lord of the harvest. He's
[1:41:53] the only one that can drop that handful.
[1:41:56] Now notice the prophet taps into an
[1:41:59] unseen world and said God says, "I
[1:42:02] command the angels to go from Louisiana
[1:42:05] and Virginia down there that meet in
[1:42:07] Kentucky and I want you to I command
[1:42:10] them I command them I command them to
[1:42:13] drop handfuls on purpose.
[1:42:16] I have come under the uncction of the
[1:42:19] Holy Ghost to drop more than a handful
[1:42:22] off. But the living revival that this
[1:42:25] bride is under, I command them.
[1:42:31] Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] Hallelujah.
[1:42:35] Hallelujah. Hallel
[1:42:38] Hallelujah. How many needs a fresh
[1:42:41] revival?
[1:42:43] How many many needs a stronger prayer
[1:42:46] life? How many needs healing?
[1:42:50] How many needs more of him?
[1:42:57] Brother Baron one time said he he was
[1:42:59] talking to some men that said that when
[1:43:01] they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:03] said, "We've have we've reached God's
[1:43:06] summit." He said, "Oh
[1:43:08] no." He said, "Oh no, you're not you've
[1:43:11] not reached the summit." He said, "But
[1:43:12] there's more. There's more." How many
[1:43:16] here's got the Holy Ghost, but you want
[1:43:18] some
[1:43:19] more? I say there's more for you. I say
[1:43:23] it's more for you. I say the angel of
[1:43:26] the Lord that is in this room, he's here
[1:43:28] to do business with your life.
[1:43:35] Don't miss your opportunity.
[1:43:42] How many times do you hear the prophet
[1:43:43] on tape saying she's going to miss it?
[1:43:46] She's going to miss it.
[1:43:49] Dear God, she's going to miss it. Don't
[1:43:50] let her miss it. And he calls her by
[1:43:52] name. He calls this I see you out there.
[1:43:53] So won't go out of trouble. Don't miss
[1:43:55] it, sis. We're to help you if you if I
[1:43:57] told you where you come from. You come
[1:43:59] all the way from Indiana. Don't miss it.
[1:44:01] Don't miss it. He's right there. The
[1:44:02] angel of the Lord's moving right there.
[1:44:06] What are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[1:44:08] saying, don't you sit here at this gate
[1:44:10] and wonder like the three lepers that
[1:44:12] stood there said, "Are we going to have
[1:44:14] to live here? Are we going to starve out
[1:44:16] here? Or can we have this revival? Can
[1:44:19] we have this anointing?"
[1:44:23] You know what? If we go back to our
[1:44:24] house, they going to kill us. We go down
[1:44:27] there to the enemy's camp, they going to
[1:44:28] kill us. Why said we here till we die?
[1:44:32] We might as well go down there and take
[1:44:35] what's rightfully ours. And there was a
[1:44:38] thunder clap that sent the enemy out of
[1:44:40] Kentucky so that you could
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:44] feed. Don't get shook up by the thunder.

[1:44:50] enemy so that you can feast on the
[1:44:53] unfailing mighty
[1:44:56] word of the son of man.

[1:46:30] voice, neglect to lift up our voice and
[1:46:33] say, "God, we got a need.

[1:46:40] in our bodies. We need more of you in
[1:46:42] our lives. God, I pray that you do
[1:46:46] something. Lord, I see the witness of
[1:46:48] the Holy Spirit moving

[1:46:53] to distract and steal away the attention
[1:46:56] of God's

[1:47:28] May they begin to speak intimate things
[1:47:30] with you, Father.
[1:47:32] Lord, may their home life begin to be
[1:47:34] different. Lord

[1:49:44] name, he'll be there too. And when you

[1:50:49] midst. He's in the midst of our storm.
