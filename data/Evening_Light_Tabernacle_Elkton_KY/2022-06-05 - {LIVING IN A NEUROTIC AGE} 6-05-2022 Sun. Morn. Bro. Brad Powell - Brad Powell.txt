this morning amen and so brother brad amen will bring the message this morning amen and we're so thankful amen that he'll do that for us and looking forward to what god will have so i think at this time amen we'll go ahead and dismiss for sunday school amen uh so anybody we have different classes if if anybody up there wants to come uh but that's okay if you don't either but i know that amen so anyway god bless you um brother troy have you got one ready tommy's going for us okay all right praise the lord how y'all doing uh i was gonna read this thing uh i had bought a few little tracks off the voice of god i'm gonna try to share a few things i got some variety packs and uh i was reading this one this is the mystery of god revealed and you know they have like three testimonies in here of uh people being healed and stuff and i just thought this was really awesome out of the out of the three that they put on there and this one says tris griffin went to the doctor's office in early 2013 because of back pain that she feared could be reoccurrence of her battle with cancer mri showed an aorta of dissection in her heart and the doctors alleged further tests and scheduled an emergency surgery the next day the line thought the heart through the heart in the image in the in the obvious issue that would mean a quick and almost certain death if it ruptured shows a picture here if y'all remember that's the same thing that happened to me and it says in the next day after believers pray for her and the doctors conducted another ct scan to pinpoint the location of the the dissection before surgery this time the images showed a complete heel completely held the heart baffled the surgeon told miss griffin i don't know what to tell you you hadn't ordered this section but now that all evidence is gone he showed her images before prayer and then after you're free to go and by the way there's no sign of cancer either you're perfectly healthy i thought that was awesome man yeah praise the lord man i i was getting into that i was telling brother tom i said i'd kind of been on my heart but i was going to tell y'all too that uh if there's any uh body that want to go out and do any witnessing or something with me that uh you know i was seeing these guys you know denominational people going out doing outreaches and stuff you know and you know we just want to get them to god get them to christ you know and uh so i was buying some tracks up and different stuff and if anybody has it on their heart just get in touch with me and we can try to do something you know but uh they say you can't keep what you got unless you give it away and so the more god gives us i felt like you know i'm seeing these guys do things you know i've seen some baptist ministers going out and just doing some outreach and stuff and it's just like we see them do that you know we're the bride of christ you know we should be held to a higher standard we can get try to give something away and go help and get back but anyway uh if you want to turn the i didn't tell you to afford to go yet john 3 john 3 10 through 21. jesus answered and said unto him art thou master of israel and know us not these things i've told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever shall believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh through the light unless his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light and his deeds may be made manifest they are wrong praise god you know brothers and sisters when you come up here there's a big difference between sitting there and coming up behind the pulpit for daniel and for all of you i'm it's it changes as soon as you come up the steps and have to speak to the people whether it's out of the word of god whether it's a testimony whether you're preaching whether you teach the matter what it is there's a transition from the minute you come up the steps until you open god's word and try to speak to the people you know your natural bodies once is nervous but once you yield to god you know everything's possible you know you can't you can't let yourself be defeated yeah you know i can remember what was it like 19 i think it was like 1993 1992 when i first started teaching sunday school you know that was an uh you know when you like i said everything's everything's easy until you're accountable for the things you say to people in a spiritual sense it shouldn't be no fear there but it gives a sense of responsibility that you're responsible for what you tell people and what you say to them whether you're witnessing to them or whether you come up here and speak to them everything we want to do is out of love you know i was thinking to what brother tommy was talking about what thomas was saying or even last wednesday you know there's two things that bring you here this morning either duty or love there's just two things that make you come to church this morning either duty or love if it's duty then it's a grind and you don't do it out of love it's just a struggle you do it every day it's a struggle you don't have no victory you don't have no love or you come here because you love god and you just give everything that you are to him and that makes all the difference in who we are as individuals this morning i you know i i can i know i say it a lot but it's true i can only speak for myself and my own family and then as brother thomas the pastor he speaks for all of us through christ but in in the responsibility that it gives us as christians this morning i was reading this this morning but if you turn with me i'm totally not where i should be but if you return with me to uh hebrews the 13th chapter it's not a long chapter but i mean there's a lot of truth in it this morning for all of us to glean as christians and as believers this morning i don't know if i'm going to read this whole chapter or if i do i apologize before i get started but you know this is paul and again you guys have some truth here that you know a lot of preachers in the world that would argue with you if you said paul wrote the book of hebrews but if you believe the message for the hour brother branham told us that you can't there's no question that paul wrote this these 13 chapters here but i'll just let me read to where i feel led to stop in this first verse let brotherly love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unaware you know he's basically giving you a truth in life no matter how you feel in the natural doesn't give you a right to treat people in a bad way no matter how bad you're feeling how angry you are how sad you are when you're dealing with people you need to freedom in a loving way remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourself also in the body if marriage isn't honorable in all and the bed on the file but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge when i read that last sentence there because your semicolons there you know that's pretty brutal for the age that we live in right now they think they're going to get away without being judged for their adulterous and whoremongering ways and it's you're not going to escape it let your conversation be without covetedness be content with such things as you have for he that hath said i will never leave thee nor for safety that goes against our hd that fifth verse right there it's a very covetous eight that we live in every once after learning people along the way and he goes on to say in the sixth verse so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what men shall do unto me you know that's true he goes on and remember them which have ruled over you which have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation and if that's another scripture you know people don't want to accept authority anymore in the age that we live in in a in a governmental sense or in a christian sense and i'll just finish with this jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so whatever god told us 2 000 years ago in the gospel is no different for us today every you know people tell you that but you have to receive it it's got to be seed in your heart if god made a promise all the promises of god are true if jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever those promises apply to you this morning if you just reach out in faith and accept those promises and i was i listened to several things but i'll just i hope i go to the right place here you know not wanting to be out of order you know the in corinthians it says the spirit is subject you know but uh i'll just read this quote here this morning it comes out out of this match as i stand at the door and knock and i i was i wrote a note down here on the side margin everything we do motive is everything that we do what your motive is that that tells me who you are or what you are what your motive is what do you bring what are you doing what is the motive for the reason you're doing things and only you can examine your heart and life and know what your motive is and anything that you're doing and uh this is the 56 quote and he's you know he's in this message he's talking about god knocking at your heart and going for all the all the rooms of your soul and all the rooms of your heart your spirit and this is one quote here i want to welcome him this morning in my heart to every room to all that i am i want to welcome him at every door swing it open and stand there and kiss the cup a blessing with him in the door and say yes lord all i am and all i have and all is yours and let's stand at this door lord and commune with each other and let us commune at the door of faith lord let us have communion at the door of pride lord let us have communion at the door of selfishness lord take it all from me lord faith and he's that's pretty true today as it was when he preached this i think this was in 1957 and i'll leave with that this morning all i would have to say to us this morning everything that we are this morning is in jesus christ and whatever your need is this morning whatever god wants to do for you this morning he's more than able here this morning to meet your needs whatever they are whether they're physical spiritual natural whatever they are i know that god can meet our needs this morning so as brother josh comes just hold your faith out this morning whatever god wants to do for you he's more than able to do for you this morning man let's stand this one we'll start with that song see the bright light shine number 613 oh there's the light in the window someone's standing by the open door

mama came to the doctor on friday to a neurosurgeon and was a direct admit to the hospital and had surgery on friday this was a miracle in itself and exactly what his kids had been praying for before surgery she was in excruciating pain unable to walk and required 24-hour care due to several canal stenosis severe canal stenosis and five bulging discs since surgery she has been pain-free only experiencing the normal soreness of surgery this is another miracle i ask you all to pray that the nerves in mama's legs wake up completely and she will be able to use her legs properly tomorrow we

many's got your cup all right let's see if the lord can fill it up for us uh turn in your bible you would to john 16. i noticed we read in the scripture picture earlier today already of john 3 i think so we'll turn to john 16. i'm going to try to take a little thought this morning that you'll have to just bear with me i'm going to try to slow it down a little bit maybe emphasize some things uh pretty heavy that i feel like we need as believers in this hour and and uh looking at a i guess a little thought if if we put a title on it a neurotic age and uh you think when you hear brother branham talk about that you think that uh you you think he's talking about the age that he was in or the people around him when in fact if you really list look and listen and kind of break it down uh you'll see he maybe was talking more about us as believers in the age we're living in so uh yeah let's just we'll break that down if we can so john 16 will go to verse 19. um verse 19 and chapter 16 of john now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do you inquire amongst yourselves of that i said a little while and you shall see shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me verily verily i say unto you unto you that ye shall weep and lay man but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for the joy that a man is born into the world we look at that verse right there and you see that she is in travail and has sorrow because her hour has come if we were to ask any of the ladies or the mothers here that's had children you could ask what is that travail what are you talking about what is that if they would tell you they would say it's a feeling of pressure okay they're in travail they're in pain they're in pressure am i right amen uh but but her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered she remembers the pressure that pain that anguish no more because now she's in a joyous state now that baby's been placed into her arms and she's holding her coddling her her baby and and things are now changed you don't feel it anymore the pain and the pressure is gone let's continue on and you and you now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you aren't you thankful for that and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall ask and the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs so he's speaking to him now in kind of a a christian code you might say proverbs you know you have to be a christian you have to be a follower a disciple to listen and understand and break down what he's saying and he they're not even sure really what is what he's talking about here and he says i'm going to have to speak this plainly to you he said but the time come when shall i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall show you plainly of the father that in the day that you ask in my name i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and you have believed that i came out from father from god sorry i came forth from the father i'm coming to the world again i leave the world and go to the father his disciples said unto him lo now speak thou plainly plainly and speak as no proverb please lord speak to us plain tell us what you're saying and he says not now that we are sure they know us all things and need us not that any man should ask thee by this we believe they'll come us from god and jesus answered them and said do ye now believe behold the hour is cometh yea is now come that you shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me and i want to get to this right here verse 33 these things i have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer what's it say next i have overcome the world what a savior i have overcome the world so i'm going to speak like i said on the on this morning on living in a neurotic age let's just pray heavenly father we thankful to be in your house this morning thankful for those that's come out to worship around your word to fellowship with believers and sisters uh brothers and sisters of light precious faith just to come and and to hear the word the word that's sent to draw us closer to you lord and lord we thank you for where you brought us from and thankful for where you're taking us lord and we just asked or that you just ministered to our hearts this morning speak to us lip to ear help me to allow me to get myself out of the way that i could just bring this message to drop close and to bring us closer as believers to be able to overcome this neurotic age we live in we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you and dedicate the service into your hands and that all that be said and done being bring honor and glory to you in jesus name amen you can have your seats so speaking about this neurotic age and like i said i'm going to try to i'm going to take things and try to break it down some some definition some words some terminology because i think we're living in an age that uh we're all in unfamiliar territory right now uh we think we've been under pressure we think we know stress we think we understand neurotic behavior but we're i think we're in unchartered water uh pressure that we've never seen before and pressure that will be coming uh before the rapture takes place to get his people ready so uh when i look at neurotic i looked up that definition here brother brown used that back in the 60s 50s 60s it means anxiety and depression and worry guilt you react negatively to things around you you're irritable you're angry you can feel threatened you even have a feelings of depression at times and when he began to speak on this he's spoken in several messages one of them he spoke on this plainly and clearly many times was in letting off the pressure and when he speaks about this he says what would i speak to this congregation and he said i thought to myself well they're probably trained right in everything no doubt i feel like we've been trained right and about everything we can possibly be trained in the message of an hour has laid out the word it's laid out the scriptures it's opened up the word the mysteries of god have been revealed so we've been trained beyond a doubt the way we should be trained and he says but there's pressure on the people today and that pressure listen now has no limitations or any denominational lines it has no age lines it has no respect of person it's on young and old and good and bad it's on everybody pressure he said we're living in a neurotic age nervous tension if i were to ask you and it's okay we're going to be honest with each other today if i were to ask you how many of you have felt like you've been under some pressure this week look at those hands hands everywhere why because we're living in a pressure age and he says it's nervous tension everybody's racing here and and going there and going nowhere it's just that kind of age and i know this church would be played with it as it's everywhere is plagued with it the tabernacle is plagued with it everywhere the whole world it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait he said we drive 90 miles an hour to get home for supper and wait two hours for it to get ready was that was that last week how many have you done that last week think about it hurry hurry hurry and then wait that's right it's a time it's in the rushing and speeding and it gets you in that nervous tension now we're getting into the home front wife said something a little contrary and you want to fly off the temper that's that nervous tension husband say something you'll pat your foot and you'll tell him get in the room well now husband i don't want no words with you go out there nervous tension what causes this pressure wife i'm i'm so nervous what's the matter see it's all this tension building up and then the result of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place i think we've got angels in here this morning doing something wrong and acted out of place and he said it'll make the poor at that way it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way and it'll make the good act that way oh we've hit everybody now hasn't we and he says it's the steam it's the tension it's built up it's you've got to blow it somewhere it's got you've got to blow it up the boiler's got to blow up and he said it builds up as the day goes you wake up you're in a pretty good shape you're happy things are going good you get to work you talk to the boss there's where it starts and he says oh and so and so and so and then you speak to the kidneys come in here at the end of the day the kids are the ones who usually take the brunt of the pressure the wife is the one who usually takes the brunt of the pressure there you are it builds up oh my see you feel like your head's going to come off he said i know i'm with it every day i know what it means it builds up is anybody relating to what he's just said over the last couple of weeks i've been just praying and it's been coming to me constantly this this thought of pressure and i think we're living in a day of tremendous pressure and stress that is caused by this pressure just turn on the news for a few minutes and you'll begin to find plenty to stress over the economy i say we're living in unchartered waters we've never felt this kind of pressure farmers are talking about how it's costing a thousand fifteen hundred two thousand dollars a day in fuel to put crops out truck drivers are spending thousand twelve hundred dollars a day to fill up a fuel tank do you realize that's putting a strain and a stress and a pressure it's going to hit us all it's going to hit us all joyce asked the other day she said did you hear about that school shooting i said yeah i did a little bit she said well did you hear how many was hurt or how many was killed i said no i i i try to quit watching the news and i said i'm tired of watching the news because everything in the news is negative and that negativity constantly is producing what pressure and that pressure begins to produce what stress i approached a good friend of mine the other day one of the happiest go lucky people i've ever been around and i'm talking to him and i come up to him and i said you know hey how's things going you know how's your mom dad how's the family he said man he said i just feel like i'm under so much stress he said i just feel like i'm so under so much stress and he said i don't even know over what he said he said it's not the church the church is doing good he's pastor of a church he said the church is doing good i don't know what it is he said mom and dad they're sick but they're doing good you know they're they're they're well they're doing good he said i just feel like it's from every direction all around me stress stress stress and this has been on my mind so i've been maybe picking up on it more than others did you notice brother brian sorry brother brian i'm gonna pick on you last sunday i think it was he got to read the scriptures and he was having trouble and he said i just feel like i'm under a lot of stress that was his words and i said my goodness that's two in a row one after another after another yesterday seen a guy at the ball game i said hey i said how's it going i ain't seeing you he said man he said i i i'm stressed out he said my phone is constantly ringing i can't get off i can't get my work done he said i haven't slept but a few hours this week he's i can't even sleep until i get so exhausted i can't stand up he said the stress is just almost more i can take this guy's a landscaper he's not a doctor he's not doing surgery on people he's not he's not a pastor of a church trying to make sure people are people are well he's a landscape he's planting flowers and mulching and mowing and he's under so much stress that he can't even sleep at night brother sisters this world is in a completely neurotic and stress-ridden state right now and when we look at stress what is stress stress is a feeling of being under too much mental or emotional pressure and here's where i'm going to slow it down and and and see you you listen to some of these things and say hey i'm going to check up from the neck up because i don't need pressure and stress getting in my head we don't need that as christians and believers we don't need things to pull us down to drag us down to hinder our homes to hinder our jobs listen we got a lot of people in here that are in high stress situations pressure turns into stress when you feel unable to cope people have different ways of reacting to stress if you notice that one situation to somebody that feels stressful to this person this person over here feeds off of it they're motivated by it this person over here the same stressor that puts this person in depression this person right here is ready to go tackle the world so we can't say it's this one thing for everybody no because stressors come in different forms in different fashions and life's demands is what causes stress your work your relationships at home i'm preaching to myself because my wife has told me in the not too far go past that you're so irritable why why am i irritable nothing is everything is good everything's fine there's nothing wrong but why is every little thing just puts me on edge stressors pressure stressors relationships money problems you want stress in a marriage have money problems manage your money to the best of your ability and if you don't know how ask somebody for help go see your pastor he's your financial advisor if you need help say i don't know what i'm doing with my money i don't know how to handle it i don't know where to spend it i don't know how to save it i don't go see him but he knows how to tell you how to do that don't let money be a stressor that ruins your marriage and your relationship with your children when you begin to feel stress you can get in the way these demands you can't sort them out have you ever noticed that when you start getting under this pressure in the stress they begin to overlap you heard it when it rains it pours well let me tell you it's raining on a sunny day when it rains it pours they begin to overlap it's this and then it's this and then it's this and then it's the children then it's the wife and then it's money then it's the car then it's the house payment oh boy then you have a flat tire i can't get to work and then the pressure keeps coming and coming and coming and this stress begins to affect how you feel it begins to affect how you think it begins to affect how your body works sleeping problems sweating loss of appetite difficulty concentrating has anybody ever noticed sometimes when you get under stress and maybe this person's asking you a question you got this on your mind they ask you and next thing you're just in a mental fog and you don't even know what they've said and you're just sitting there nodding yeah yeah yep and you walk away you think what in the world did i just agree to you begin to feel anxious and irritable your self-esteem begins to go down your thoughts begin to race and you can't slow down i i i just told weston the other day i said you know son oh he's talking about sleeping habits and so i said i just don't i've never required much sleep i can go to bed at 11 12 o'clock get up at 4 35 i said because my mind just keeps working it just goes and i can't fix this problem before i'm already thinking about this and i and it just constantly it's just constantly in motion i said i maybe i'm like leonardo da vinci was i think he worked six hours slept three work six slept three worked six left three because he was constantly emotion it reflects your mind it affects your sleeping the next thing you notice is you begin to lose your temper yep and you act unreasonably yeah have you ever have you ever known have you ever had that happen where you you're in a discussion and maybe a little bit of a a little bit of a qualm or quarrel with your spouse can you say the most unreasonable thing that you can imagine knowing that you don't even believe it but but because your mind is not working right and your temper's up you say something that's completely irrational some of you know what i'm talking about and you would have never said that if you were in your calm christian state of mind and then you begin to experience headaches man my head's just hurting i got to go to bed my neck i'm so tight my back i can't i think i'm having a heart attack this is pressure dizziness because what happens is the stress when it becomes in your life you get these hormones begin to come up and they boost up and you get these uh these endorphins that come up and it's like your fight or flight i'm here to survive and it doesn't matter if it's your wife if it's your best friend when you're under stress and under pressure they say the wrong thing bam i'm going to fight i'm going to survive you won't beat me and these emotions begin to get up here [Applause] but what happens is if the lion is chasing you you're running and your emotions are up high when the lion goes away you calm back down but when you're overwhelmed with stress and pressure those endorphins never come down they stay up here so you're constantly on defense you're constantly in a full state of motion you're constantly and anxious you're constantly waiting for the next problem and when it hits bam because you're up here bring it down here we need those stressors to come down so we have to ask ourselves i said we're in unchartered waters things have changed things are different what has changed what is different you want to know what's going on i'm fixing to tell you what i think is going on the problems that plague our modern day were the same problems we had 30 years ago 40 years ago it's the same problems we still have money issues there's still the rich there's still the poor there's still rumors of war there's still all these things uh controversies that's going on in work and family it's nothing new stress and anxiety has been around since the garden eden i'd say adam was under a little bit of pressure i'd say he felt a little bit of anxiety with what was going on so what is it has changed what has changed is the shift in technology how many thought i was going there think about this now the change has come in the shift of technology the way we relate to the world over the last three decades brothers and sisters our access to information and connecting to people all around the world all the time begins to feed our stress you know years ago if a war was fixing to take place you'd know it a week later in the newspaper is that right or if you have if you had the luxury of owning a radio you could dial in and you could hear attention with you know attention so and so it's good happening and once you found out that the war was taking place it was another week or two or three weeks into the war before you ever find out what's going on so your day-to-day living just kept kind of cruising on its lower paced speeds but today it's not that way we have full access second by second by second updates we know what's going on in russia before they know what's going on in russia and the first sign of a rumor listen to where these stressors come from the first sign of a room or anything happening what does it affect wall street the economy goes down the second they talk about a war the second they they put a new president in the very second anything happens the second there's a bridge collapse the second there's an earthquake the second the cardinals beat the cubs wall street goes down what does that do you say what i'm not a rich person we're in kentucky what does that affect us a few years ago i remember buying eggs for 59 cents a dozen somebody sell me some for 59 cents a dozen now i'll take about 12 dozen go buy some meat go buy some bread go buy some milk what is milk now uh let's see the other day i was at the dollar general joe i said can you stop and get a gallon of milk sure i'll stop in there and get some you know what they had one half gallon of milk for four dollars and nine cents yeah unheard of prices you say that how does that affect us it constantly keeps the the stressors keep going up the demands keep going up so this constant connection information could be great in some ways but it never gives you a break you never have a chance to slow down unwind turn things down and just just enjoy the moment stressors and pressure so what does the devil do he says i'm gonna allow them to work from home on their computer they don't get enough of this facebook and their downtime we'll send them all home to work on their computers it's an age of laptops work from home i was having lunch with a friend the other day and he run into an acquaintance i didn't know who she was but he said hey how's your husband doing well he's doing good is he staying busy oh yeah he he he says he takes off on thursday he's this guy what he was talking about was a pastor of a church he said yeah he says he takes off on thursdays to just sit home and rest but he always asks me to go get his computer and he starts typing emails never a moment to stop and slow down just constantly under this pressure of work work do do do and all of you many of you know the drill i'm talking about how many of you check your emails facebook instagram facetime whatever's out there right before you go to bed come on people come on people sure we do but you know what one of the worst things that you can do for your sleeping pattern is to look at a blue screen on a computer tablet or cell phone right before you go to bed you know what it does to you let me tell you satan is a smart smart person he's a smart entity because when you look at that blue screen and you're saying man i got to find out got to make sure there's nothing come through man i got to make sure nobody commented on my status it makes your melatonin drop blue light makes you want to rise up it makes you want to be energetic and your melatonin goes down so now you're sitting there and your circadian rhythm your sleep pattern is all disrupted because now you've been looking at this computer and you're exhausted tired but you can't fall asleep and then when you do fall asleep you're waking up because you're here oh that was that was a text come through i better see what's going on and this goes on all night and you think you're getting a good sleep and you wake up you look at your phone and it starts all over you say what's that got to do with with my stress my pressure well let me tell you if you're tired and you're exhausted and you're not sleeping well are you a little bit irritable brother jeff he's shaking his head oh yeah yeah because you begin to get irritable and you get tired and the pressures begin to add up and overlap end over end over in and it's a constant thing so we need to be careful with this big express event of this information age that we're living in technology and information because we're getting stress overload and it's turning the world into this neurotic that he was talking about let's look at pressure pressure is defined as the burden of physical or mental distress it's a constant a a weight of social or economic imposition this this is this the stress of urgency of matters demanding attention you ever felt like you had so much to do with you don't even know where to start that's not a fun feeling because it usually puts you in a position that you you don't ever start because you have no goal you have no agenda you can't get anything in order and it just puts you that much farther behind pressure pressure i like the verb definition of pressure to cook in a pressure cooker how many ever feel like you're living in a pressure cooker you feel like you're living in a pressure cooker of life hey don't get discouraged [Music] years with that brothers and sisters because some of the greatest things in the i know to this point i've made it sound like it's we're in doom but some of the greatest things that ever happened happened under pressure we need some pressure in our lives we have to have some pressure and i want you to know that this morning because pressure pushes us to prayer pressure pushes us to rely on god pressure pushes us to dedicate our lives to christ so it's not an entirely bad thing but when we allow pressure to convert into stress that's where our problem begins philippians 3 paul's telling the people here brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before us once they say i what press i press toward the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus therefore let us as many be perfect thus minded if anything ye otherwise be might be otherwise mighty god shall reveal even this unto you i press toward let me tell you something about paul paul was under a lot of pressure paul was under a lot of persecution paul was under a lot of ridicule in the day he was living in but he looked at this situation he said no matter what i'm going through i have to endure this pressure because i'm not where i want to be yet and i'm going to press on even though the pressure's on me i'm pressing on he knew he had to press on and couldn't turn back brothers and sisters how many of us this morning are planning to go on the rapture raise your hand are you there yet no we're not there yet but we're planning to go we're not we're not there just quite yet so that means there's more for us here to attain with our walk from god that's why we have some pressure to push us into a walk in a relationship with god that we can't be held back and with the because the pressure we feel around us it ought to be the greatest motivator in your life the pressure that comes upon you it ought to motivate you into a place that nothing here compares to the joy of jesus christ as i thought about this as i thought about this it's the pressure that that makes me long for the catching away of the church because the pressure is something that we're not going to get rid of you can't outrun it the only thing you can do is outlive it by living in christ and i was thinking about this you know i got a little spot on our on our farm that i don't know what it is about it it just it just pulls me there it's quiet it's calm it even has a an aroma about it that just soothes you down and i thought as nice as this is as nice as this is and as calm as it is for me to just go up there and meditate and pray and think and just get away from the stress for a little while it's nothing comparable to what it'll be when i face jesus in my lord it's nothing comparable there's not enough joy here on this earth that can even come close to comparing we need a little pressure to keep us on our toes [Music] he says i was speaking here not long ago about being in africa watching a little lamb from where the natives had this little corral and they let this little fella out and he was grazing and all the once he got real nervous and i thought what's the matter with this little guy he said but as i watched he couldn't see it but in the distance was this great big yellow main line slipping through the grass he said he smelled this little lamb and was making his way to him and he said he was so nervous he didn't know why sometimes we call it a premonition but now the reason was he was nervous he didn't see the line but he know death was lurking near the world he says seems to be in the same condition they know that something is lingering near that something is fixing to happen he says it builds up pressure of course to the center but the christian who's instructed in the word ought to know that it's the coming of the lord so we need this pressure because it is an alert it's a warning it's it's telling us get ready get ready get ready the more pressure that comes upon this earth is is god pushing his bride to getting themselves into a better place [Music] he says but the christian who's instructed in the word knows this is the coming of the lord it ought to be a glorious jubilee to the christians to know that the end is not and brother branham was criticized he said someone said unto me not long ago you scare the people when you talk about it might be the next hour you scare the people he said scare the people what people he said not his people no he said it's the greatest note that we can ever sound that's what we're looking for behold the bridegroom cometh that's what we live for we live for the coming of the lord what else could you be thinking of when the pressure and the stress begins to mount up on you what else could you be thinking but come lower come on i know it could be greater nothing greater than that hour but to the center i know it's a terrible thing he said but when the storm is coming over a parched land you know what i'm talking about when you can sense that storm that rain is moving across the land that hasn't been rained on in a while you begin to feel that breeze pick up you begin to feel that storm coming and you know that the rain is fixing to come he said it ought to make you happy to breathe because that air is coming the rain is coming in that air and we're living in an hour when we can feel the storm coming the storm is all around us but the rain is coming breathe in the rain [Applause] spain talking about spain here this is not him this is something i've researched spain led the world in the 15th century and on her coins she had a little bit of a national arrogancy about her and she inscribed the the inscription knee plus ultra which means nothing further nothing further meaning that spain was the ultimate in all the world there was no more greater there was no more bigger there was nothing else to discover spain had it all until the discovery of the new world and then she realized there's more out there this is not the end of the world so then she began to print her coins and she put on there plus ultra which means more beyond and we think about that put yourself in that situation when you as a sinner before you came to christ there was nothing more than what you wanted to but this world there was nothing more but when you see the new world when you've seen the new way of living when you see the new christ you begin to look at that and you've been said listen there's more out there there's more for me so if you don't know healing this morning there's healing for you if you don't know love in your heart this morning there's love for you if you don't know peace in your life and your job in your family there's peace for you and more importantly if you don't know salvation jesus is for you there is a cross of calvary where you can find yourself down there and jesus says i'll give you all that i have everything i have is yours talking about the some christians now let's look at this for a minute i'm gonna get to my text shortly we see brothers and sisters many times that the world begins to press down on and you can see it like a train coming and the world you can see the pressure on them and you can see it begin to mount upon them and before you know it it presses down on them and you can see that they're thinking about throwing in the towel how many times have you seen it that people they get under pressure and you begin to pray with them you pray for them you go check on them you check on you call them and say hey how's it going just want to make sure everything was going good just keep just you know just staying in touch with you praying for you only to find out a few days later maybe they've left the church the pressure mounts up on them to a place that they allow satan to take over they allow the the pressures that satan and the stress that satan has placed on them that they leave the church what happens next they walk away from their marriage they walk away from their kids they walk away from their careers pressure and before you know it they walk away from christ completely and that's when you can say pressure has converted into stress that a person that they cannot handle there's so much pressure everywhere listen everybody seems to be under pressure what does it what's the matter everything a day of pressure people are driving through the streets 90 miles an hour and getting tickets from policemen and run down the road almost take a chance on losing their life to get five foot in front of somebody oh boy i was driving along just minding my business the other day going to the hopkinsville i was in the lane i was supposed to be in somebody was beside me nowhere i could go and this woman out of the blue just darts out in front of me like a hurricane i hit my brakes doing 55 it was 55.60 somewhere in that range hit the brakes slow down she darts in front of me gets over in the other lane pulls up to the light like a i don't know what and just i look at her i go like this where's your hurry where are you going the light's red what are you doing i thought i better quit she's going to pull a gun out and shoot me but it's that age of neurotic thinking go go go hurry hurry hurry she almost caused an accident probably a three or four car accident if she would have been a fraction of a second sooner i would have hit her the car behind me would have hit me the one beside me i would have probably run into it why all because she was in a hurry to leave work to go see something that she couldn't even get there the light was red you say well brother brad isn't going to happen to me because i'm a christian i'm a christian these kinds of i i god won't allow this to happen to me let me read you this next quote even christians it's bothering them did you hear what i said that's why i said when i started people a lot of times wanted to think he was talking about the neurotic people around him no he said i have been known to be neurotic study it up he said i've been known to be accused of being neurotic thank you even christians it's bothering them see some of them all pressured up and you snap off enough temper built up like they're going to blow up what's the matter something's wrong it shouldn't be that way temper comes from satan i like what he says here because they can apply it in a couple of ways he says everybody's under pressure though he says of course i don't believe it's in this group here he said but you know these meetings are being taped so it'll go other places you see so i'll be speaking to that group that's under pressure that was this nice way of saying i'm sure none of you can relate to this but or it's either his way of saying it's not for me it's for us but i thought you know that kind of bothers all groups pressure if satan can get you under pressure he's got you whipped people are doing things wrong trying to hide from it oh you're talking about pressure you start doing things that you know is not right and you're trying to hide it you're trying to live secret secret sins secret things in your life you want to talk about pressure that's pressure you can't handle that christians are not made to live that way and the pressure becomes so strong that eventually you're gonna have to find yourself at an altar and say god forgive me for where i'm feeling you because i know i'm not supposed to be living this way [Music] trying to hurry now just because we got communion that don't want to take too much time but let's look at moses for just a few minutes thinking about moses i heard preachers say one time said there's no pressure in pulling the baby from the river the pressure came from pulling the profit from the baby let that sink in for just a second there was no pressure from pulling the baby from the river the pressure came from pulling the profit from the baby so it was really easy for her to reach down and grab that little basket that was the easy part hard part was when it began to build up and god began to call moses and say you're going to be my prophet you're going to be my spokesman you're going to you're going to be the one that goes deliver my people from the hands of egypt that's when the pressure started that's when it become to get real when when he began to be called as a prophet so here's moses a life full of pressure born and raised a hebrew born and raised hebrew raised in the house of pharaoh in egypt you say well he didn't know no different i beg to differ i think the scripture tells us that miriam his sister went got the nurse made his mother and he sucked from her and she educated him the prophet said she taught him who he was he knew who he was he knew who he was by blood by being raised in the house of an egyptian family being raised in the house of an egyptian family where he is he can never be as good as those around him he can never be as good as those around him but yet he's watching from a young boy the past masters beat and enslave his own kinsmen and so here is moses watching this day after day after day pressure can you imagine seeing knowing that your blood relatives your aunts your uncles your cousins your closest people are out there and you're watching them be beat day after day after day while you eat with a silver spoon that's pressure that's pressure and this pressure begins to build up and what does moses do he goes and he commits murder now he's got this on his mind and on his heart and he runs out into the wilderness to try to escape this pressure that he's now under and he's escaping this pressure and he's going out there in the wilderness and god's saying i want you to be my prophet i want you to be my servant i don't want no part of this god i'm just trying to mind my own business but there's that calling they call and it keeps coming down at him and keeps coming back at him but god i stutter i'm not eloquent in my speech god but you're going to be my spokesman have you ever tried to get up and give a speech it's tough it's tough and have you ever thought about having to give a speech and you can't even talk that's even tougher and the pressure that he's living under now and his time goes on and on and on now he's got the pressure and the task of announcing to his former palace his former ruler he's got the task now of announcing i'm going to bring plagues upon you my god says let my people go or there will be plague after plague after plague and judgment of death on you pharaoh we think we got pressure they leave out of egypt all is well now right everything's good man we're going to the promised land we're right on the edge of the rapture everything's good right where did this red sea come from where is this army i hear them coming what is not supposed to be this way god you didn't tell me this was in the playbook pressure he's got two million people standing behind him saying moses what have you done you want to talk about a boss with a bunch of angry employees moses what have you done and under the pressure of the people he begins to seek out god and finds himself with his hands raised up and the waters part all is well right the army's gone they've been defeated miriam's dancing with the tambourine she's having a good old time on the other side life is grand but the people begin to complain about their hardships and the lord hears their anger in numbers it tells us in numbers 11 it says then the mixed who were traveling with the israelites began to crave good things of egypt and then the people of israel also began to complain did you ever notice it was the mixed yeah they weren't all they were all believers two million people they weren't all believers it was as the mixed begin to stir it up the mix to begin to get in there amongst the believers and encourage the israelites to hey we need to put some heat on moses hey moses we remember what it was like to eat fish in egypt hey moses we remember what it was like to have cucumbers and melons and leeks and vegetables and we we ate good we had onions and garlic we had all we wanted we remember that moses but now we don't even have an appetite because we've gone without food for so long complaining the pressures of the complainers they're an area of the country where there's nothing but granite and rocks and desert no vegetation the mixed crowd you know the mixed crowd pretending to be believers believers make believers non-believers and here they were the mix in the crowd tagging along for the ride they can't handle the pressures of egypt no they can't handle the pressures that's coming on of leaving the exile of of egypt they wasn't built for that but they're just tagging along and you know they're that you see that around the message too you see that around the message these people just hang along the message but you never really see them devoted you never really see them committed you never really see them really giving it their all you know we're all going to make mistakes we're all going to fall but i'm going to give it all are you with me give it your all you may fall flat on your face and you may not even make it but go down fight give it all you've got to make into that rapture but you see these people they just hang along and you know the funny thing about it is we're all pretty much equal in church we're all listening we're all amen and we're all having a good time we all thinking about god we all singing songs of zion and victory but the tagalongs something changes about them when they walk out the doors it's no longer songs of victory it's other kinds of songs it's no longer songs uh uh words of encouragement it's words of defeat it's no longer thoughts of pressing forward but it's negativity they become the murmurers the rumor spreaders the complainers moses had them [Music] yeah we're going to have them too and you wonder sometimes while the pastor's under so much pressure oh you don't see it you don't see it most of the time because god builds him different they're built to handle the pressure [Music] moses experienced this miraculous power of god in delivering the children of israel and now in the desert moses is experiencing this conflict and complaints so brother sisters no matter where you're at in your life whatever walk you're in we're always going to have these complaints we're always going to have circumstances we're always going to have tribulation we're going to have sorrow that's what our scripture said when we started didn't it it said jesus said as long as we live in this world we face tribulation and sorrow you know what it said at the first of it it said you might have peace might be peaceful but i guarantee you you'll have tribulation and you'll have sorrow so moses is being tested continually by this stress oh day after day after day after day and he finally comes to a place and he comes to god under the pressure of the people and he says god i cannot carry these people by myself the load is too far heavy he said i'd rather you just kill me and take me out of my misery pressure pressure moses finds himself in a worn out beat down burned out depressed exalted ready to give up state of mind and god says you know what moses i want you to recruit 70 men that'll help you out moses didn't just jump and say i quit i give up i'm walking away because so many times people do that i've had all i can take i'm done with this i'm walking away i never want to see this again i never want to go back to church i never want to be around people i never want you know brother brown said i wanna just go up in the mountains and be a trapper and god what was that that was pressure on the prophet god's man for the hour and we think we're so we're not subject to that kind of pressure but whenever we find ourselves drained it's good for us just and physically exhausted it's good don't make a major decision i found out if i if i need to make a decision i'm under a lot of pressure it's best if i just kind of [Applause] stop and catch my breath wives be patient with your husbands when there's decisions to be made because it's easy for you to say what are we going to do what are we going to do what are you going to do what should we do how are we going to handle this give them time to breathe give them time to pray give them give give god time to send 70 workers to come and help give to god time to smooth out the situation where you can make a sound decision so god they begin to complain we're hungry we want meat i'm sick and tired of this man we want some meat give me some steak moses says god i don't know what to do with these people i i don't know i don't know how to handle these people so god says i'll send you meat more than you will ever eat see sometimes we just have to go to god and say god i don't know what i'm gonna do i don't know how to handle this pressure i don't know how to handle this situation but i know you're a provider so out of the blue quail begins to flutter about three feet high where they can just walk and pick the quail can you imagine walking pick and quail like you're picking corn and they eat so much quail they have it just left over and left over they don't know what they have so much meat but their bellies are full they're happy they're content we're always content when our bellies are full aren't we yeah yeah you can be you can be hungry man you can be hungry but you get a little food in you hunger's gone you're content you're happy but that didn't end for moses poor guy who does he come from next miriam and aaron his own flesh and blood miriam and aaron come to him and say moses we're a little bit upset with you your wife just died and now you go and you marry an ethiopian of a dark-skinned tribe that's not even of us critical criticizing everything he does most of the time you know what i found what why people criticize what is it jealousy they were jealous of moses they were jealous of his power they were jealous of his authority they were jealous of what god was doing in his life and so they wanted to try to find anything that they could nitpick and tear apart we have to learn as christians to be kind of easy going because your worst critics are going to come from those around you criticism from blood it's tough that's your brothers that's your sisters i'm glad i'm criticism is tough it's easy too to be on the other side of that and be the criticizer and before you know it you don't even realize but you're putting more pressure on people who's already under pressure there's a story i read in a book um in the book by stephen covey it's called seven habits of highly effective people has anybody ever read it i figured brother joe had brother josh has but he tells a story in there and he tells the story of a man who's has his children aboard the new york subway and the children were loud and they're boisterous and they're disruptive and they're running everywhere and they're sitting beside uh stephen covey and and he says this man is oblivious to his children's behavior he's just letting them go wild on there and he says mr cobby says finally i said sir your children are disturbing everyone i wonder if you can control them a little more and the man looked at covey and said oh you're right said i i guess i should do something about it we just came from the hospital where their mother died about an hour ago said i don't know what to think and i guess they don't know how to handle it either you're talking about a humbling experience mr covey said his his attitude changed dramatically he said he learned a valuable lesson to seek to understand before seeking to be understood know somebody's situation before you're the one pouring fire pouring gas on the fire put yourself in somebody else's shoes this man was under so much pressure because he just lost his wife he didn't even realize that his children were running erratic people began to pressure moses now this is where we have to be careful we're going to have pressure are we all in agreeance of that people begin to pressure moses we need water we need water and the lord told moses moses go and strike the rock to produce the water and just like god told him moses strikes the rock and the water flows through and everybody's happy everybody's content everybody's thirst is quenched they're ready to go on they're happy it's flowing in abundance then in numbers in the book of numbers we see the same situation moses we need water moses we're thirsty moses we're gonna die now you keep in mind right now that moses is at a later age in his life he's dealing with second generation of these uh people that's in the in the mixed he's dealing with a younger generation of people he's dealing with the the people that are the age of joshua and caleb and those younger people some of the older ones have done died off he's up in age you know they say there's a reason that that people have kids when they're young and not when they're old because older people can't handle the pressures of kids sometimes i wonder how i do but moses is an older man now he's dealing with these people coming at him day after day we want water we want water we want water and god tells moses moses just speak to the rock and as he's going to go to the rock he was going to the rock of salvation and the people are constantly most we need water we need water we know the water here take your water what did stress do for moses there's consequences when we're under stress god said speak to the rock he didn't say smite it you can't smite that rock twice because the rock died once and for all the rock jesus christ was smitten once not to be hit again and the bible tells us when we teach it i think it's in corinthians that the representation of moses in the wilderness that rock was christ and because moses disobeyed under the pressure because he disobeyed what god told him he broke the whole continuity of the bible and because of that he says moses you cannot enter in to the promised land this journey's been on for your entire life it ends today you can't smite my rock brothers and sisters that scene was just a witness of a stressed out prophet moses had all he could handle and he lost it he had all he could handle he lost that he blew up and he missed entering into that promised land if moses would have just slowed down it's a people just give me just a second we'll have water i promise he's never failed us he's never let us down just give me just a minute water come forth he would have stepped right into the promised land brothers and sisters a lot of times we beat things when all we have to do is speak to the rock if we can learn and teach and train ourselves to when things are going hard and pressures on and things are going against us i just need to go see the rock i just need to go there was a story i read about a state trooper he was awarded an outstanding trooper award the governor award the war told him said you've been a trooper for 15 years and you haven't once roughed up a drunk or used excessive force on anyone how can you be a state trooper for 15 years dealing with the kind of stuff you deal with and have that happen and the trooper responded well there's two things first if i'm called to break up a fight at a tavern i never say to myself there's a drunk i always say to myself there's a man someone's husband someone's son someone's neighbor who got drunk he said so i always try to think of him as a man and not a crime that's pretty good wisdom and he says secondly the bible says that a soft answer turns away wrath he said so whenever i walk up to the window of an automobile i always speak a little lower than the person i'm speaking to that's pretty good wisdom we can take control of the situations in our life if we would just slow down and don't let the pressure build into such a place that we can't handle it but let me tell you this we all can be a little rough around the edges right but have you ever heard the saying the person is a diamond in the rough yeah we're all diamond in the rough and the story of the diamond is that the diamond is the conditions surrounding the diamond they're formed under precise and intense conditions that diamond needs to be both under very high temperature and it has to be under strong pressure to become a diamond so sometimes god has to turn the heat up in our lives a little bit god has to put the pressure down on your life just a little bit so that you can find yourself able to to turn yourself from from just a rough piece of carbon into a shining sparkling gem of a diamond that diamond says it says it has to endure and duress 725 000 pounds per square inch of pressure at 2 000 to 2200 degrees fahrenheit that's pressure that's heat be of good cheer i have overcome the world knowing that jesus has overcome the world should bring us good cheer knowing that someday there will be no more pressure should bring us good cheer knowing that someday there will never be another a squabble another cross word with your husband with your wife with your boss with your brother with your sister that'll bring good cheer how can we how can that be because he says i have overcome the world want to leave you with one last illustration here as we before we turn the service back when a person dives under water we've probably all been swimming sometime if you can swim you've tried to go as deep as you can and you know everybody wants to go set on the pool bottom right you try to get down there and set the bottom but when you dive into water at about 10 to 12 feet you begin to feel that physical pressure of the force on your body right you feel your ears begin to pop they begin to hurt you can feel your pressure on your face you can feel it just kind of pressing in on you and for somebody for the untrained person you can go probably about 15 feet deep and that's probably all you're going to want about 15 feet because it's going to start getting really uncomfortable but you know there's people that's trained to do what's called free diving and what these free divers do they go out into the ocean into the depths of the ocean they drop a cable down into the bottom maybe a thousand feet deep then they get right there at the edge of the boat they grab onto a weight a sled they call it and it runs down that cable and they take one deep breath and jump in and let that weight take them as far as they can stand it the world record is 705 feet deep on one breath the pressure is immense and it happens quick the pressure is so immense on the body that they say the cluster you know your lungs are made up of like like say a cluster of grapes your lungs compress so tight that that their lung actually comes becomes the size of grapes these two big old pieces of lung tissue that you take in full breaths with the compression comes down down that's how they can go so deep because the pressure there so when they reach the bottom and they reach down to 500 600 700 foot deep they let go of that weighted sled they grab a hold of another one break it loose it's a balloon that takes them right back to the surface as fast as they went back as fast as they went down they go up and their lungs begin to expand there's limitations in that kind of pressure diving but how many has ever heard of a submarine a submarine dives in a little bit of a different condition the submarines can go down there it's full of men it's full of people it's they're working and some of these submarines go to some of the deepest depths of the ocean some of them 10 000 one of them i seen even 35 000 feet deep how can they do that how you how can that how can it not just crush upon itself like the lungs of a person you know how it does it because they add pressure from the inside and that pressurized cabin begins to push out against the pressure on the inside and that's what we have to do if we're going to combat the pressures of this world we have to have more jesus on the inside pressing against the outside so that we can say i can endure any pressure satan puts upon me we need to pressurize ourselves with god pressurize ourselves with prayer pressurize ourself with the word of god pressurize ourselves with songs of zion victory and overcome and pressurize ourselves with fellowship of believers you love the lord this morning god's certainly good to us don't get discouraged with the pressures of life but see how you can apply some of the things that were said today to overcome these pressures and find yourself walking closer to go pressurizing yourself against the tolls against the pressure and the weight and the stress of the world and when it comes on it comes on strong just take a deep breath god is in control speak to the rock let's stand brother byler if you'd like to come for communion that was good amen i like that illustration i never really understood but they said uh pressurized cabin for going in the air and i'm like pressurized you know but i think i understand after the morning you build a little pressure from the inside out amen how many needs more of that in your life to your lord jesus and i know one thing's for us as we go on through time we're going to need more of it amen have to count counter pressure amen that's power heads and close your eyes lord jesus we want to thank you father for the wonderful word that you have brought to us lord this morning father that we can take home that we can lord jesus digest lord jesus and let it become a part of us lord jesus and we just ask now father as we want to honor you as you have asked us to honor you lord in remembrance lord of what you did on calvary lord jesus and given as a way of escape from the different pressures lord jesus to run into christ lord in the cleft of the rock and be safe lord but we want to honor you this morning with communion the lord and we ask god that you just bless every portion of it father and as we partake of it to think of you lord jesus what you did for us on calvary how did you purchased everything that we ever have need of lord jesus and making us a part of you and give us an inheritance in you lord through the cross we ask god their blessing upon it not in jesus christ's name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will we will do one
