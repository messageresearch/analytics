jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together in your name lord and father just to turn our eyes on you to look at you father what you are knowing lord jesus that uh father when we look at you lord lord the things of the world just get strangely dim lord and we just thank you father for being such a wonderful god and such a great savior and all that you are father we can't even begin to imagine but lord we just so appreciate you father we just want to ask god tonight that you'll just be in the service lord please each bless each one father the efforts that they have made to come those out there on radio land lord we ask god you bless them father this evening as they listen in may they be blessed also and receive something from you god and we ask god that jesus bless the reading of of the word and the meditation of our heart now in jesus christ's name amen and amen if you will turn your bibles to ephesians once again to the book of ephesians and i told you i wanted to speak on the eagle a man jehovah eagle amen tonight so that's what we want to speak on but i want to start with where we left off there's a uh something in there that i may pick up that i may pick up a little bit later but i want to read it in ephesians galatians ephesians the fourth no yeah the first chapter verse 19 through 21 and then verse 6 and 7. 19 says and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places this is what we're going to focus on a little bit this next next verse notice where he's placed he is placed now far above all principality amen how many knows he's above everything now far above all principality and power and might and dominion in every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things in the church [Music] then over in verse 6 chapter 2 verse 6 let's start with verse 4. but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and has made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus amen now over in deuteronomy i want to read that one yet before i have you seated i guess it's numbers i thought it was numbers i've got wrote down here deuteronomy let's hope i'm not wrong or i'll really start out good tonight we'll try numbers 21. that's what happens when i don't put this sticky note in there okay numbers 21 no that is not the one i was looking for okay all right i wonder where i wrote that over here it is deuteronomy 32 11. all right deuteronomy 32 11 we'll i'll put a sticky there because i do want to read that one a little bit later okay back to deuteronomy 32. of familiar scriptures for us message believers 32 we'll begin with go from 9 to 11. for the lord's portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness and he led him about and instructed him and he kept him as the apple of his eye and as the eagle steereth her up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad abroad her wings taketh them and beareth them on her wings so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him amen may god bless the greeting of the word you can be seated tonight amen we want to look at tonight as jehovah eagle amen so jehovah typed himself here as the great eagle now i know there's different types different things he typed himself with and this wouldn't be on the same line perhaps as a father or or things like that but he typed himself with being the great eagle amen that found him in a weight howling wilderness and took care of him and kept it as the apple of his eye amen now as we begin to think about the eagle there would be there is so many things i mean so many good things that we learn from what the prophet taught us about the eagle amen and i want to i'm going to mention some things but i don't want to just go over things i've said a lot before i want to try to go in the direction that the holy spirit kind of had me go i feel like with the eagle and looking at the eagle we want to look at great mama eagle amen now i don't i've never watched eagles don't know all that much about him so i go by pretty much with what brother branham some of his experiences that he had let me just tell you what experiences that he had with him and then we'll take some lessons from that he says now as the eagle steers her nest this was in tulsa oklahoma on a sunday morning 1960. how i've watched them so many times a few days before the nest steering time comes the old mother eagle would get up there on the side of that nest and lay in many i've laid many a days in the warm sunshine watching them and just crying like a baby to see that big mother eagle they're large he says the mother eagle is larger than the father eagle so their wings bread spreads 14 feet sometimes from tip to tip and she'll get up there and she'll strut around all over the nest like that and she'll go up to those little ones and she'll spread her great wings and scream and when she does sometimes it'll knock those little ones plum on their back see he wants them to do that that's what she wants them to do then they'll get up and she'll scream and my she's training them to hear her voice to know her voice amen so how many knows it's very important i believe that you know if we was all honest we would probably say i wish i would be a little more familiar with that voice amen so that i would know that voice at the slightest danger that i face you know because how many knows the holy spirit can warn you of a trap that the devil's fixing to lay or something's fixing to happen or you just get nervous and you don't know why and it throws you on your knees and say god i don't know why i'm nervous right now i don't know what's going on but whatever lord is it just you might wake up in the morning at three o'clock and don't know why you're wide awake and thinking about certain things or a certain person right but how many believes it's important that we know his voice mean it's it's very important i i the one thing about this message is one thing brother branham always taught us is stay with that god's word because we all got ideas we all got thoughts but thoughts but that's i believe that's one reason we know that he was an eagle was because he stayed right there with what god said it doesn't matter what it was amen because soon as you get off of that you get way off from left field real quick having a cow eating grass up on top of the tree or something like that amen but one of the things i want to look at tonight on this jehovah eagle is the material that jehovah mama jehovah or father jehovah eagle is made out of amen the material that he's made out of because as he describes here she'll get up there and she'll flop her wings and she'll go strutting back and forth and just flopping them wings and as i thought of my own little thought on it he says i thought you know maybe maybe she has sometimes uh when the babies are half grown or three quarter grown or whatever maybe she'll do a flyby and i don't know a hundred and they say 110 mile i don't know how it decides enormous amount of speed that they can pick up and how fast that they can go so you can imagine that that mama trying to teach those eagles what they're capable of and she comes perhaps a nosedive she has to have a nose she can fall faster if she does her wings a certain way points in a certain way she can fall really really fast she can actually fly i mean she can actually flap her wings downwards a little bit and make herself go faster than she would just fall amen but perhaps she comes by and she goes down here and all of a sudden there is a swoosh of wind almost like it would be a jet fighter going over a ship and doing a flyby when they're not supposed to right amen and just whoa you know just blow everybody right off back almost well that's about what baby she does for those little eaglets and those little eaglets were saying maybe to each other i can imagine they'd be saying like what what was that that was scary all right and you know the martin says you know i think that was mama that i look like mama i mean how many knows when you really think about god he's almost scary you better fear him you better have some reverend some fear for him is that right fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom but she does that and she they're like wow that was neat you know and maybe she comes in and mice will come in there 100 miles an hour but just as she comes down she goes and stops and roost right on top of the mess and they're like wow that is really neat but she looks at him now notice let me read this on the next verse here he says after she talks about then it's so important that they know her voice i mean because of all the dangers they'll feel that and so forth and i want you to know what the eagle sounds like and when she spreads her great wing and say lookie here she says looky here i'm fixing to give you your first solo flight but first i want you to look at how big i am now i want to stop there for a while i want you to look because that's what we're doing you know what we're looking at it looking at god we're looking at who god is looking at what god is look at all the different attributes of what god is and the more i think about what god is the more i realize that even the scripture talks about look unto me he ends of the earth and be he saved amen because beside me he says there is no god and more i realize in everything we need god you need more god and god more than we realize look how great i am oh how sweet it is maybe sometimes sickness will knock us on our back maybe something else and when we can look at those great big wings of jehovah amen he allows us sometimes to go things and have things that happen so we'll look at him and realize how great he is oh my i've listened to the message called look brother i'm talking it was so true everybody is looking at something i mean as you you're focused on something you're looking at something you've got a goal you've got an objective i'm looking to do this i'm looking to do that and that right everybody's looking at something and it makes a huge difference in your life depending on what you are looking at it's important that we keep our eyes and we keep our focus on jesus how many knows as we see this world falling apart i'm telling you right here amen and out there it is time to not look so much at this world and begin to look at the other one because this one's going down i'll tell you what if i was on uh the titanic and it was going down what would you do what would you do if you was going down [Applause] you'd look for something wouldn't you you'd be looking for a lifeboat yeah you'd be looking hey where is lucky we didn't care about how fine the shrimp and the chicken is in the kitchen you wouldn't care about how good that is the leftovers inside of the other the second no you'd be making sure you get on the lifeboat that's what we're doing amen because the world's going down and you better begin to look for the life look amen at what you're going to step into that is going to save you it so back to the eagle we look at this and she flaps her wings amen and she shows them what she's made out of not only what she can do because we can stay there all night because jehovah is a great god he's powerful god on the way to church i thought about how that the uh omnipotence the all-powerfulness of god is totally inconceivable to you and me your human mind can never comprehend the power of god amen how can he could just speak the word and the gases and the neutrons and all these other kind of gases if he says he wants a piece of wood he wants a piece of metal he'll have certain chemicals come together right and they'll form into whatever he wants it to be i can't understand how that could ever happen but it does how did he could have made the solar system the galaxies and everything else just to try to comprehend so you don't have to try to figure out his power do you but i like to see what his power can do we see the results of his power amen of what how great jehovah is when we look at the bible now how many knows that just looking just it's just the idea of looking just looking can save you look unto me right and be saved remember the brass serpent in the wilderness they all had sinned and they were bitten of serpents they murmured i believe it was complained and murmured and because of their murmur and complaining god send serpents among them and they were getting bit bitten the leg beating the five bit everywhere everybody was coming into the doctor with snake bites a lot of them were dying of snake bites and saved moses help us help us and what did they do they went and they got god told moses to go ahead and take a serpent and put it on a pole right and he says and it'll come to pass that whoever is bitten if they will look at that serpent on the pole they'll live [Applause] now what did we find out that the serpent on the pole represented sin judged huh sin judge because it was a type of christ hanging on the cross now let me ask you something was christ sinful on the cross no but the bible says he bore our sin he took hours into calvary on the pole right and we have to look to him if you ever expect to get saved if you're ever going to get blood you can't look at bo buddha muhammad any other religion not any other religion you can look at and be saved you have to look at christ on the cross represented that wicked serpent the evil in every one of us is what put him there right and we look at our sacrifice that he died for us and that's our avenue to life whosoever looketh upon it amen will be saved amen goes right along whosoever believeth in him shall not perish amen look and live look and live look at jesus christ and live it's recorded in god's word hallelujah it's only that we look and live right look and live how many believes is important what you look at i was thinking about this and i thought you know there's another way of looking and that's with your hearing right you look with your hearing all right because the bible says you know we faith comes by what hearing hearing the word of god preaching and talking about these things of how great god is brings faith now right preaching the word of god brings faith but it's not so much just the hearing but if you ever have talked to somebody and they're explaining something to you with their words and you're hearing their words and they say do you see what i mean huh now if you're still confused you better do like me no you better explain that about twice more and then i'll get it right but once i get it yeah i see what you mean because you heard with your ear but you understood with your heart the bible says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened in other words you have to understand amen so that's another way that we truly see amen and that how many knows that's something that's given of god for being able to comprehend and to understand amen is something that's given by grace amen all right another thing that i wanted just say is i made a mention about everybody's looking at something it it it goes back to the scripture that wherever your treasure is there your heart will be also your mind your your that's what you're focusing on wherever your treasure is amen amen i want to share a terrible testimony with you but um let me see this i wanna i wanna talk about just this is a little bit on the side like um if i can find it in psalms 37 this is what i've been trying to do this is what i try to do all the time but with this little series that i've been speaking of it's just helping me a little bit more to do so and that is to think about him that is to keep my thoughts keep my eyes on who he is amen and what he is now the bible talks us that we should do something and that is that we ought to delight ourself in him delight yourself amen have a good time in him delight yourself in psalms 37 and 4 there's a promise given that says delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thy heart i can't tell you how many times that i've desired something that i needed something this is just naturally speaking now this this goes in every realm but and it was some time later then all of a sudden god just give it to me i'm like you know i didn't even pray for this but god knew i wanted it amen so me and donna we're trying to build an addition onto our house just in case anybody's wondering and uh i was gonna lay block monday or was it tuesday no it's monday so i went to the rental place because i'm a mason i can do masonry work nothing can really be real proud proud of but anyway so all my life i've wanted a mixer i wanted a mixer you know and just some old one i don't want to spend two 2 500 or 3 000 not that i couldn't but i only use it twice a year so i don't need it a lot but i went to rent the mixer and boy i had my block all spread and i was all ready to go and i was going to get all them block laid you know and have a schedule and all that and i come there and she says yeah we got one we got one here but i can't read it tell you i'm like oh wonderful i'm gonna be shoveling on that wheel barrel in that hole and i'm gonna be oh my this is not going good folks right and do you have another one yeah we got the big went out and looked at this great big concrete mix i'm like i don't need that for 220 a day you know ah i don't see something else when we went back in there says well i said why don't you just sell me that old jump they said it's not running right it stalls out all the time there's either a bearing out in it or something and i guess they had a new owner and they were going to sell a bunch of stuff and i can see it was one on one of the list of selling and i said why don't you sell sell it to me i tried to get himself before me before they wouldn't but anyway so i went out there while she was talking to the owner and all that i went out there and cranked it up you know and and then just stalled out it cranked it up and it hurt like getting this that's a good sign if it burst a little bit it's good i'm gonna have to put an engine you know maybe on it but it'd just die out you know everything else was fine i says well pretty good price on it they came and gave me a good price on it and i says you know i take it and i told mike on the way back i said i don't know what's wrong with this engine and i'm gonna check the fuel filter and i'm gonna go through it you know do my mechanical he says dad you gotta just take it to the small straight to the small engine shop and help me you know don't make it certainly fix it basically no not really but anyway he was like just get it fixed i said well we come home and pulled that thing off of there and and donna says well check the oil check the oil check the oil all right and donna had prayed that this morning that morning right donna lord i sure wish you'd give him a mixer sometime and uh she prayed and so forth the lord knows i've wondered on phone for a while and then when i went out there and i turned that little thing open where the oil goes in and when i opened that up you know it's kind of at an angle and just look at a little dipstick little thing when i open that up oh i'll come gushing out i'm like i know it ain't supposed to be that full i grabbed the side of that mixture and i picked it up and dumped some of that out put it back down put it back in perfect ever since they just put a little too much hole in it i'm like woo thank you lorna that's the way to start out of the morning i was gonna have to spend 100 bucks almost for today's rental and i got for about five more rentals and i got me a knife but anyway so i was going to say you know i called him back i said hey all that was wrong with it's just with little oil can i pay you more no i didn't do that i was happy with what but the lord had given me amen but i thought you know that scripture came to me that scripture came to me because the lord knew what i've wanted what i needed and i've won it when i says boy i sure wish i wouldn't have to think about the 200 i need to lay so i don't have to lay the rest the next day you know and get the mixture again because it's just me and boy me and my wife we was just praising the lord all day and i said yes look there honey it don't have to go home tonight i'm i'm chilling i'm just taking it easy i'm not playing so fast now but i'm telling you how many believes just just just delight yourself in the lord delight yourself in god and watch what happens the bible's promise is that he will give you the desires of your heart if you delight yourself in the lord because i'm telling you there ain't nothing else in this world that you can look to that would even delight a person or make you feel good or bring joy to your life there is nothing else you can look at why shouldn't we look at him more why shouldn't we keep our eyes on him so why shouldn't we see it how great he is we talk about these uh sams of killing a thousand philistines and becoming invincible thousands of years ago but he is the same tonight god is just alive today as he ever will was or ever will be folks one of these days his voice will be silenced perhaps and you won't hear it anymore but i'm here to tell you god will never be silent god will never sleep god will never rest i will never die he'll always be and he's the one that'll raise us up help me believe that delight yourself in the lord he'll give you the desires of your heart what did paul what did david say he said the man is blessed that walks not in the counsel of the dome that knows that don't delight in god of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the sinners nor sitteth in the seed of the scornful but his delight folks i don't know about you but when i'm sitting down and having me a good uh butter pickle and ice cream i'm having me a nice little delight when i get down on my prayers and say lord how are you this morning i love you you're such an awesome god we're having a little delight time with the lord when we come to church we come here to delight ourself and not to be some stiff starchy to give the lord our blame and our tired huh no he deserves the best but his delight is in the law of the lord and any law does he meditate day and night praise be to god now notice day and night he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water you won't be dried up you won't be shriveled up you'll have plenty of water you'll have plenty of moisture you'll have plenty of holy spirit moisture hello that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper nothing will stand in your way whatever you do will prosper wow aren't you glad for that oh it don't always look like it didn't look that way for daniel but daniel he looked up to christ three times a day didn't he got on his knees he kept his eyes on the lord kept his eyes on god amen it looked terrible they threw him into the line said but guess what he came out just fine he prospered became uh maine one of the main leaders amen my to think of all the people that have looked at him i mean not the three hebrew children i love talking about him why they had their eyes set on him we don't know whether we will but they're looking at and we know that he can and we're so if he does wonderful if he don't that's up the hill but i know he can but we're not bowing to you because it's against what he told us to do they kept their eyes on him and because he kept their eyes on him he kept their eyes on them how many believes god keeps his eye on you he's got his eye on every one of us i he just don't see you when you come to church and then he don't see it just when you do good things he sees when you do bad and he sees you and with every thought that goes through your mind a christian it should be very troubling to you just to have a wrong thought huh just to have a wrong thought oh that that bothers me why why does that go through my head huh all right let's go on let's look at the materials that she's made out of first of all this eagle is light amen she's light and i thought about that eagle being able to fly you know birds for to be able to be flying they have to have feathers you've heard light as a feather do you ever see one of them chicken feathers a little bit fluffy feathered me just kind of like you said everything it's so light jesus says come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden that i will give wrestling still from my yoke is easy and my burden is light you got to be light people not heavy in order to fly you can't be heavy so i was thinking about this weight and what they make airplanes out of you know i got to thinking about being an airplane pilot sister chinese and i told my wife i said if i was an airplane pilot i said you'd have i'd be using the highways probably that'd be i'd be saying if you don't like the way i drive get off the highway i have to plan to be somewhere i'm way too rough cut for all that like almost like they say if you don't like my driving get off the sidewall but one thing i looked up and the bird of any airplane any airplane has to be made out of they get the lightest material on every front that they possibly can whether it's a mixture of this that or the other but one of the main ingredients in an airplane is titanium a real real strong but a light the lightest metal you can get how many knows they will go everywhere wherever they have to go to mine that and to get that to get those airplanes as light as they can folks i don't know about you but when i get up in the airplanes and then wings go to bend in about six feet i'm like is that supposed to do that the answer is yes they're actually kind of flimsy because i'll tell you what they're not made for crashes no they are not made for christ they will fall apart in a heartbeat in a crash they made the fly they were made to hold their weight but they're not made to hit things but that tandem and that it was made out of something light and that's what let me tell you something that's what mama eagle is made out of and that is what you're supposed to be made out of something that's light doesn't have a lot of weight to it amen and the thing of it is is the eagle is made to soar it's made to fly above all the earthly things huh ask yourself this are you still bound down by earthly things are you flying above it huh because remember jesus is all above all of it now hell death the grave sorrow depression and all he went he was raised way up above it and he got up into heavenly places like the eagle is up in heavenly places and then he says you who were dead in sins trespasses right he's quickened us and he also raised you and me up into heavenly place if you want to know what heavenly places are begin to think about god more how great he is just begin to try to fathom his power try to fathom his omniscience omnipresence and how great he really is he swooshes those wings and look at that look at that look at this look at this look at this huh and that thing could fall right backwards out of the nest on off of a cliff all it is is basically just did you know i'm sure you've all fantasized but you see buzzers and you see other birds flying and soaring but wouldn't that be nice huh huh you think boy wouldn't it be scary up there we just we gotta have this right here this is not scary right here this is solid right but you know but up there you get off the ground a little bit it gets scary for us because we just wasn't made with wings but those birds were trying to enter into their thought whenever they fall out over top of that it's just like them taking a step they don't even think about heightened scared or nothing because it's just like taking a walk to them they do it all the time right it's completely common to them why because they don't have to be scared because they know what this can do what it'll do so it has to be takes lightness not a material let's just talk about a christian's material and and i'm going to look at it a little bit different because you can also take this as your warfare and your weapons and so forth how many knows that papa god is made out of love he's the very essence of love amen and he's made out of faith he's made out of faith he's made out of love and those are probably the main ingredients that i want to talk about tonight for a little bit all right we're talking about light material heavy material faith is a light material doubt is a heavy material sin is a weight how many knows there's a sin that so easily be said lay aside every weight get rid of every weight so when you're gonna fly how many believes that we're all eagles tonight we all wanna learn how to fly a little better so it's important what kind of material that you're made out of you have to have the kind of material as the prophet said you can take a pliers and you just can't rip them feathers odd hardly even with a pair of pliers they're in they're so hard they're so stuck but they're light so when you want to get something to fly they said you know about airplanes it says if they don't use a lot of heavy steel it'll be way too heavy and never make it off the ground right so they don't use a heavy steel like what you might think they would use can't be heavy so i brought a rock tonight now this i went out there some of y'all may have seen me but you know this makes a good skipping rock if you throw that fast enough the only reason this is going to fly is because of the power that's behind it but you throw this and it's going straight down it's just a weight way too heavy right way too heavy i thought there's another material and i took one of my notepads here you take the right kind of material i haven't even i don't know if i even test like this but you remember them little things yeah so we're going to try that all right whoo hey it's not supposed to go down so fast but it did but it flies right what'd you get for that for me here can't leave trash laying around throw it back at me would you maybe it'll fly better for you oh yeah there you go huh that's design right designed shaped to fly now you get a little engine or something out here and it's gonna go right that's to make them all the time tour airplanes you know it'll go why because it's light it's just feather light as it goes that's what you and i have to be if we're going to soar above the world sometimes you can't be all weighed down let me tell you something this world is full of people that are weighted down how many happy people do you find not a lot of you don't find many people happy you can't hardly well sometimes i i try sometimes to wave with people people won't wave at you you look at people when you go to the grocery store and you want to know how they don't even look at you it's just keep huh and and we get that way sometimes right i do that sometimes i get such a hurry you know and you know you know but he doesn't you don't have to look far to know that most of this world and most of the people out there have got all kinds of weight on them now how many knows that we have peace with god and we get light because of the faith that we have faith in almighty god is the absolute material to pick you up it'll take you out of their sin it'll save you we're saved by grace through faith that not of yourselves is the gift of god gotta have faith without faith it's impossible to please him amen amen it's what picks you up my there are so many things that are weights and that are heavy but the first thing that we have to have is that faith in our lives now notice now ultimately so we're not here after 9. what this eagle what papa eagle is trying to get across to us eaglets is that we are made out of the same material and we believe that that you are made out of the same material that got it whatever jesus was you're made out of the same material this just comes fresh to my mind better bam talks about you know if you want to have everything that's in the ocean go get a tablespoon full or a cup of the water right out of the ocean and every thing that's in that ocean and that water is in that cup that's the way it is with you and i when we have the holy ghost everything that god has now we possess and god's whole ambition is that there may be many sons of god in the image of god are you with me because somebody believes we're taking a flight one of these days we are taking a real flight right out of this world but before we get to there we have to lighten up we have to set aside all the weight all the doubt in our eyes on the right thing look up begin to focus on the right thing oh my praise be to god god is so good i am so glad i mean he wishes everybody why can't everybody realize that if they just look to god they can have joy they don't have to have sorrow they don't have to be depressed you don't have to be depressed it's heavy it's terrible to be down in the in the dumps [Music] to terrible the place to be but joy unspeakable and full of glory i got to listen to some of that good gospel music i got the dancing on my deck my wife walked out on me and disturbed my dance for the lord but i thought you know i just get carried away it's just god is good amen i don't care if nobody sees you somebody does nobody has to see you you out there by yourself that's a good time to think about the lord amen praise the lord so you look at it just to look at him and to see the power that he has how many we all know that god don't have any doubt right there's no unbelief in god what did jesus say to himself which one of you who can accuse me of unbelief ah you can't accuse him of unbelief he's got nothing but faith faith picks you up it gives you strength it gives you what overcoming power and so does love that right now abide in faith hope and love and the greatest of these is charity right how many believes we need to overcome this is about coming up above like jesus said there like the bible says there in ephesians he is far above all principality and power above it all so tonight just think about this what is it that you're not above what is it that always gets you what gets you down because remember he said he had put everything under his feet everything is under christ's feet one of the things that i really love that my mother-in-law used to tell me and there was a quote that brother manning made says something about if you're nothing if you are a part of the body of christ and you're nothing but the skin under your foot under the heel that's all you are it's just that skin guess what every devil is still under you amen every devil is still under you it's under your feet amen oh my so if you have faith hebrews says that through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so we know the whole world was framed together by the word of god can we say this afternoon those little eaglets whether they'd ever be able to fly or not isn't that right those little eagles their whole world your whole world centers around whether or not you have faith and you create your own world i mean please we create our own world you live where you live now with your address because you chose to do that isn't that right i live in lewisburg some of you live in uh lacrosse some of them in elkton whatever it might be clarksville hello you live in an apartment you live in that well it's whatever you chose you create your world you let this father you're always bothered by this oh that's not god that's you the whole world gets framed together that's eagle great top of god's his whole world is framed together by faith amen lord help me to live in a world in the realm of faith oh my how many knows it doesn't matter how much weight you have faith gets rid of the weight that's the only way to get rid of the weight is through faith oh my praise god and then the love of god comes in our hearts everything centered around those babies god cares about those eaglets every part of them everything about those eagles oh my i can just see that eagle now i can see that eagle in front of the nest way up in the top of a cliff mountain somewhere and she's about 20 feet away from the nest and she's out there just hovering she's not flopping she's just hovering just sitting there and looking over at the eagles the babies the babies are looking over at her and saying wow look at mama she don't flop she's just sitting out there in the middle of the air that's got to be so cool huh but as she is there sometimes perhaps she twitches her uh wing this way or her tail feathers they'll go a little this way a little that way did you ever watch the bird near that the tail will go a little bit this way it'll go a little bit that way it's constantly adjusting in the wind amen because it's the wind that's holding them up praise the lord let me tell you something what how many knows that the winds represent trials in our life that's what they represent trials in our life were meant to push us higher in god think about it every winter trial that comes your way met and she's there teaching them look this is what you do with wind you make it work to your favorite adjust your feathers whenever a wind comes whenever trials come you better adjust a little bit you better get down on your knees and say god i want to have a bad attitude but i know i shouldn't lord help me to help the right attitude and just a little bit of distraught and guess what it don't even bother me all it does is bring me closer to god i commit it to him i get closer to god by praise the lord and don't let your hair start graying before you learn these things because a lot of us including me get hard-headed sometimes amen but anyway to learn to fly things that come your way to trust god commit it to him and use it to let it use you to bring you closer to god praise god my let it lift you hard and you know sometimes the mama she'll go to flopping them wings and so forth she'll bring a wind into the nest and get rid of a lot of loose feathers not right a lot of loose feathers i understand there's rabbit skins and everything else that they are when their babies are born but eventually it's made out of briars under that those briars hold those skins in place and a few layers comfortable take all of that out everything sticker sticker sticker sticker sticker folks you may have a wonderful holy ghost new birth experience and then all of a sudden all these things go wrong or go wrong go wrong we'll find out whether you're eager or not isn't that right because guess what it's time to leave the comfort zone god didn't mean for them little eagles so stay in there i'm not going to bring you your food all the time huh no you have to learn to hunt the food yourself let me say this to you people i'm not gonna bring your food all the time you have to get the food yourself you need your own revelation from god you need your own experiences and revelations from god if you're ever going to amount to being a good eaglet amen you have to learn to get it yourself amen oh my learn how to pray yourself how to read your bible seek god how many believes that so that's faith that's the strength of faith is to frame and form your world whether you're going to be heavy and weighted down or whether you're going to be able to soar in the heavens that sweet peace amen some people have no rest but god gives us peace don't he that one evil was down one time remember he found an eagle in the woods and he was down all the way on the ground and there was a chipmunk just chattering chattering chattering chattering i really hate that william when you're sitting up in that tree in a and a squirrel or a chipmunk bust yeah and they just sit there and they just chatter and shatter and shatter and you're like shut up i'm trying to hunt here but says he's warning everybody there's danger there you're gonna draw everybody's attention well that little thing was chattering because it knew that if that thing could fly right it would probably be schmorgasborough for the eagle but the eagle had gotten wet had gotten down from the storm from the wind hey and folks how many ever been there get down from the wind god from down from the storm and let me tell you something only because it's an eagle and has those light feathers does that make it it don't make a bit of difference to the groundhog or any of those woods creatures whether it rained or not they're just fine right but not an eagle it has to get in the sunshine hello and it has to spread out those wings in the right and it has to let that sun dry those feathers because if you know it'd be like trying to watch a chicken fly with completely soaking wet i don't know if you ever saw it but they don't get very far they only get as high as their feet can jump off the ground and that's about it they're wet they can't do nothing but now you let that get dry you let it get good and dry and those feathers all of a sudden they come in their place where they're supposed to be again and then there's all that water is off of them the weight is off of them they're lighter it's back in normal whew think about it get in the presence of prayer right get into prayer and bask in the presence of god just pass there a while come unto me he says you know let us reason together saith the lord don't your sins be a scarlet they shall be white as snow go talk to the lord about it one time amen oh brother branham he was rejoicing i guess and having a shout in time when he saw this and he began to look at that and he says i could get my gun and i could shoot you aren't you scared he wasn't a bit afraid huh i mean that's how christians are you don't have to be afraid when you're in the lord you ain't got to worry we was on the way to church tonight all of a sudden donna's phone goes i'm like ah yeah china's they don't understand the missile over here you gotta smith that i thought in my mind that we got a missile coming i thought but don't be afraid before he busts i'm supposed to be out here so he'll be all right or it was just one of those amber alerts but i still have to think you know one of these days probably everybody'll be getting that huh then it'll leave a message we're under attack missiles are on their way it's going to happen how many knows this uh louisville 6th and 10th street or somewhere like that he says there's a missile named right there huh he says one of these days you'll see these things coming over amen but abram says but you don't have to worry he said one place he says before they crack if i've got the word right it's crack before they crack the bride will be gone amen i want the kind of new fear that hey it's on the way it's all right i'm in the lord's hands i got great jehovah god watching over me he'll be gone in the moment in the twinkling of an eye i we can we can leave faster than they can bust that bomb amen no fear that he had no fear he says and after a while when he got tired of the chatter chatter and fussing and stew and fighting and bickering and complaining and murmuring and everything else of that earth-bound creatures huh man you begin to look around look up a little bit look at this tree look at that tree all right i'm going to come we're at a good angle here i'm going to jump over here i'm going to come down through here i'm going to make it right up out of there man says he took a couple of runs and off he went a couple of flops he said and after that that wind coming up out of that valley picked him right up on the trees and he never just set his sails and those tail wings kept going higher and higher all right amen that's what we need to do take a few jumps get higher then amen i was thinking i was telling my wife i believe something to extend i says well we'll build an addition we need another bedroom and enjoy we'll enjoy it for a little bit we won't be here just too long that's right either we'll get old and die or the wraps will take place or and you know we'll keep it and enjoy it until they don't let us have it anymore yeah they'll probably take it away someday that's right that's what it's commentating they're already looking in your bank accounts or really really want to all right oh they'll get a lot more personal that but that's all right we're just here for a little bit more then we're going to take to disguise i don't know about you but my heart is i want to be ready lord work on me if you have to send a few more i don't like wins but if that's what it takes it'll help me to learn to set my wings and just be higher and higher and higher let my material be what god's made out of faith love joy peace long suffering gentleness meekness you mean those are things of that materials of light that's beautiful beautiful material but you take sorrow just a doubt sin depression huh terrible world to live in god bless you let's stand tonight musicians if you'll come how many tonight after that sermon would just say lord i want to delight myself more in you lord help me teach me how to delight
