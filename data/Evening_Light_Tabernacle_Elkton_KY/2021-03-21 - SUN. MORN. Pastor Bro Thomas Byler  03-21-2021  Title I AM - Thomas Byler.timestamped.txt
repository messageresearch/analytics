[53:02] kind heavenly father we come before you
[53:03] this morning now lord thankful once
[53:05] again
[53:06] to be assembled together lord jesus
[53:09] and father you had something in mind
[53:11] when he was here on earth
[53:13] and you said whatever two or three are
[53:15] gathered in your name there you would be
[53:17] in our midst lord and
[53:18] we believe father you had us in mind
[53:20] lord jesus knowing god that we would
[53:22] gather lord and
[53:23] and father that you would come into our
[53:25] midst lord jesus you love free people to
[53:27] gather together
[53:28] to worship you in spirit and in truth
[53:30] lord and we realize that is the way to
[53:32] worship
[53:32] father lord this morning early when i
[53:34] first woke up
[53:36] lord there's just some thoughts that you
[53:37] begin to bring into my mind and they
[53:39] just begin to pour over and i do
[53:42] truly believe the lord that it was just
[53:44] your spirit
[53:45] lord leading me and guiding me father
[53:47] and i just pray god that you'll have
[53:48] your way father this morning now and
[53:50] everything that is said and done
[53:51] and if we ask god for you to help me
[53:54] lord jesus get out of the way for we
[53:55] know that's the true gift of god
[53:57] is to be able for the servant to get out
[53:59] of the way and just to let you have your
[54:01] way
[54:02] let the holy spirit freely speak the
[54:04] things that you once said lord
[54:06] bless the reading of the word the
[54:09] meditation
[54:10] of our heart gathering together in the
[54:11] effort of each one
[54:13] that has been made lord to come into
[54:14] your house lord and those that are still
[54:16] out
[54:16] we pray that they'll come lord jesus
[54:18] won't have to be out but they'll be able
[54:19] to assemble
[54:20] also lord with us father and we just ask
[54:23] god your blessing now in jesus christ's
[54:24] name
[54:25] amen and amen turn your bibles if you
[54:28] will and i'm just going to go
[54:30] straight to the scriptures amen and this
[54:32] is actually something i'm going to try
[54:33] to
[54:34] try to do perhaps in the future because
[54:37] the lord will begin to pour out
[54:38] scriptures and
[54:40] and speak to me in his word and so forth
[54:42] and then trying to
[54:44] just lay out which scriptures to read
[54:46] first and try to lay it out
[54:47] amen i this morning we're going to try
[54:49] to just pretty much follow
[54:51] uh the way that the spirit gave it amen
[54:54] and see how that works out for us would
[54:55] that be okay
[54:58] amen and so saint john if you will
[55:01] this is the scripture that was um
[55:04] that came to me amen st john 14.
[55:23] amen this is one of the first times i've
[55:26] got three different pages same and
[55:28] usually
[55:28] my sermon is all on one page but this
[55:30] morning we have three so
[55:33] i don't know what that means but anyway
[55:35] maybe not too much but we'll hope that
[55:36] the lord just have his way
[55:38] amen the other thing is in matthew yeah
[55:40] there it is
[55:41] in matthew so we'll go read saint john
[55:44] uh 14
[55:47] let not your hearts be troubled you
[55:49] believe in god
[55:51] believe also in me in my father's house
[55:53] or many mansions
[55:55] and if it were not so i would have told
[55:57] you i go to prepare a place for you
[56:00] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[56:02] i will come again
[56:03] and receive you unto myself that where i
[56:06] am there ye may be also
[56:07] and whether i go you know in the way you
[56:10] know
[56:11] thomas saith unto him lord we know not
[56:14] whether thou go us and how can we know
[56:15] the way
[56:16] jesus said i am the way the truth
[56:20] and the life no man cometh unto the
[56:22] father
[56:24] but by me amen
[56:27] may god that is blessing to those
[56:29] scriptures turn off you will also are
[56:31] going to one more
[56:32] over in matthew
[56:35] 7.
[56:43] these were the main scriptures that come
[56:44] to my mind as i begin
[56:46] amen to get my message this morning
[56:50] matthew 7 and
[56:53] verse 13 13
[56:57] and 13 through 15.
[57:00] enter ye in at the straight gate
[57:03] for white is the gate and broad is the
[57:06] way
[57:06] that lead us to destruction and many
[57:09] there be
[57:10] which go in there at because straight is
[57:12] the gate and narrow is the way
[57:15] that leadeth unto life and few there be
[57:18] that find it may god have his blessings
[57:20] you can be seated this morning
[57:24] amen
[57:33] amen this morning's title
[57:36] amen i'm going to read i think another
[57:39] scripture but my
[57:40] title this morning is i am
[57:43] the i am amen
[57:47] i am we know that here jesus is
[57:49] declaring something that
[57:52] of course it may be a
[57:55] big controversy to a lot of people in
[57:57] the world
[57:58] and that is to say that
[58:01] what we the way we might put it
[58:05] when we read verse 6 he said i am the
[58:09] way we might
[58:10] put it this way he is the only way
[58:15] amen if he is the way then
[58:19] truly he is the only way
[58:23] amen how many knows that puts a lot of
[58:26] religions out
[58:28] a lot of beliefs out puts
[58:32] everything else out
[58:36] he is the only way
[58:40] now reading the scriptures about enter
[58:43] yin at the straight gate
[58:45] for broad is the way that leads to where
[58:50] destruction so we have a wide way
[58:53] a range a wide range of
[58:56] ways in that right but
[58:59] every other way leads to
[59:04] destruction amen
[59:07] and so really what we're dealing with
[59:08] this morning is the one main thing we're
[59:11] dealing with of course is
[59:13] finding the way amen to the father or
[59:17] to eternal life is that right to eternal
[59:21] life which has to do
[59:22] and that's why this morning service and
[59:24] of course all services but
[59:26] this especially when we gather together
[59:28] today
[59:29] we realize that it is our gathering
[59:32] together is
[59:33] more important what we're doing this
[59:34] morning is more significant more
[59:36] important
[59:37] than anything that you will do in your
[59:40] life
[59:42] and then right coming to church and
[59:44] hearing the word of god
[59:46] is more important than anything you'll
[59:48] ever do i don't care if you would become
[59:50] a multi-billionaire
[59:52] it will mean absolutely nothing zero
[59:57] because the bible says that our lives
[59:59] are like a vapor
[1:00:01] isn't that right which appeareth for a
[1:00:03] while and then it is gone
[1:00:05] i wanted to try to find a spray can
[1:00:07] brother peter amen that i could come up
[1:00:09] here and just spray
[1:00:10] and we could see that vapor all right
[1:00:13] and then just watch it disappear
[1:00:15] and totally be gone and that is each and
[1:00:18] every one of our life
[1:00:20] here on earth but how many knows that's
[1:00:23] not talking about eternal life
[1:00:25] that is gonna be that way and truly is
[1:00:28] that way
[1:00:29] if you don't find the way.
[1:00:33] amen because we know that's not true
[1:00:36] when you have eternal life
[1:00:38] in that right it is only talking about
[1:00:40] this flesh and not really
[1:00:42] even talking about just his flesh amen
[1:00:45] being the vapor and vanishing away
[1:00:47] if you find the way
[1:00:52] because how many knows that this flesh
[1:00:53] will be changed
[1:00:56] all right right and you become nothing
[1:00:59] but ashes when god
[1:01:01] calls you your redeemed body back amen
[1:01:04] brother bam says those saints that were
[1:01:06] burnt the ones that were eat by lions
[1:01:08] god will call their bodies back
[1:01:11] amen but they'll call that same
[1:01:13] chemicals and so forth back
[1:01:15] and he'll change those chemicals isn't
[1:01:17] that right into a
[1:01:18] glorified body it won't be a carnal body
[1:01:21] anymore
[1:01:22] but to to resurrect something is not to
[1:01:25] put one thing down and get something
[1:01:27] else up
[1:01:28] resurrection means to bring back up
[1:01:30] exactly what was put down
[1:01:32] but in a glorified state that's
[1:01:34] according to paul in ii corinthians
[1:01:36] it is sown a corruptable body but it is
[1:01:38] raised
[1:01:39] a incorruptable body amen and it's an
[1:01:43] immortal and so this morning i
[1:01:45] love this because we're talking about
[1:01:47] each and every one of our souls which is
[1:01:49] what we're really concerned about man
[1:01:51] and we're
[1:01:52] so grateful amen we're to have so to
[1:01:54] know that we have
[1:01:55] the way amen praise god
[1:01:58] amen what was it called it was called
[1:02:00] the seed shall not be air no
[1:02:02] it was called the uh possessing the
[1:02:06] gates of the enemy amen uh
[1:02:09] i think that's what it was yesterday i
[1:02:11] was listening to him probably god he was
[1:02:12] talking how that
[1:02:14] um um
[1:02:19] okay well anyway i forgot my thought
[1:02:22] that's what happens when you go down a
[1:02:23] certain path the lord will bring it back
[1:02:25] is that all right all right okay
[1:02:29] so anyway all right so anyway let's go
[1:02:31] back here and
[1:02:32] start over here without my mind amen
[1:02:34] getting older
[1:02:36] our mind is like a vapor too you know
[1:02:38] after a while
[1:02:39] it just kind of goes away
[1:02:42] amen it's hard to believe though i mean
[1:02:44] you know i think about
[1:02:46] you know already be almost 60 years old
[1:02:49] and how
[1:02:50] how brother troy just a few days ago i
[1:02:53] remember you
[1:02:54] over at your dad's place there riding
[1:02:56] that little four wheeler up and down
[1:02:58] that lane you know
[1:02:59] and and here we are just just like that
[1:03:01] it seems like
[1:03:02] isn't that right here we are up in the
[1:03:05] world we're now the old folks
[1:03:07] amen it is a little hard for anybody to
[1:03:10] say but that's what you are amen
[1:03:12] yeah you know you're beginning to be an
[1:03:14] old folks you know
[1:03:15] i remember a few people tell me they
[1:03:17] were 60 and they they thought it was
[1:03:19] old to be 50 and that then it wasn't so
[1:03:21] bad you know it was bad to be 60 and
[1:03:23] and people were telling me that and i
[1:03:25] thought boy 60 years old but yeah i find
[1:03:27] myself
[1:03:27] about there amen i think that upset
[1:03:30] about him 54 or so and he called himself
[1:03:33] an old man at that age
[1:03:34] but how many knows life is a vapor folks
[1:03:36] it goes so
[1:03:37] fast it's such a short time frame
[1:03:41] but amen to have to know that we have a
[1:03:43] god
[1:03:44] that we have a way we have the way amen
[1:03:47] i know what it was it was brother
[1:03:48] branham who was talking about how that
[1:03:50] he says you know we're

[1:03:53] talks about he says we're so thankful
[1:03:55] that today
[1:03:56] you don't have to wonder what's truth
[1:03:58] anymore
[1:03:59] you don't have to wonder what's right
[1:04:01] anymore jesus has come and he has proved
[1:04:04] himself
[1:04:05] he manages that message that that would
[1:04:06] say they said that he meant to know
[1:04:09] that you know that you know amen that he
[1:04:11] would
[1:04:12] go the jesus christ in front of muhammad
[1:04:15] and buddhas and and seeks the chains and
[1:04:17] all of them and
[1:04:18] 500 000 people amen the prophet of god
[1:04:22] says if your god
[1:04:23] can come and open this blind man's eyes
[1:04:26] i will serve your god
[1:04:29] he said it was a quiet bunch you know i
[1:04:32] don't know how i was here where he says
[1:04:34] in africa how did
[1:04:35] he he said that one discernment he says
[1:04:38] one miracle what was done
[1:04:40] and he said 25 000 and 30 000 raw evens
[1:04:44] gave their lives to the lord jesus
[1:04:46] christ amen because of what that
[1:04:49] discernment because of the sign
[1:04:50] amen because of the vindication and he
[1:04:52] says here in america
[1:04:54] it really doesn't mean all that much but
[1:04:57] for them to realize to have a god that
[1:05:00] can be
[1:05:00] proven amen that could be showed alive
[1:05:04] and they believed and they grasped but
[1:05:06] and even 25 000 me healings he talked
[1:05:09] about
[1:05:09] that took place in durban and how did
[1:05:11] they have to have truckloads upon
[1:05:13] truckloads of
[1:05:14] and then uh to scots and stretchers to
[1:05:16] haul
[1:05:17] all of their you know their things that
[1:05:19] they were
[1:05:20] coming in on a minute to know
[1:05:23] that we have this morning praise be to
[1:05:26] god
[1:05:27] not a well maybe we're right
[1:05:31] huh how many knows you can't have your
[1:05:33] soul resting on
[1:05:34] maybe i'm right maybe this is the way
[1:05:39] amen and you we all know that that
[1:05:41] there's a lot of different ways out
[1:05:43] there
[1:05:44] amen but we're thankful this morning
[1:05:47] amen to have the way and that we're
[1:05:49] serving
[1:05:51] the one and only true
[1:05:55] god the only one
[1:05:58] god how many believe there's really only
[1:06:00] one god every other god
[1:06:02] is false just like every other way
[1:06:06] is false it leads to destruction every
[1:06:08] other truth that they call truth
[1:06:11] is not the truth amen
[1:06:14] and also the life he is all three of
[1:06:18] those
[1:06:19] and over in genesis i believe it is in
[1:06:22] exodus
[1:06:24] 3 and verse 13 god told moses he said
[1:06:27] moses
[1:06:28] god moses said unto god you all when i
[1:06:30] come down to the children of israel they
[1:06:32] shall say unto them
[1:06:33] the god of your fathers has sent me
[1:06:37] let me read this again and moses said
[1:06:39] unto god behold when i come unto the
[1:06:41] children of israel
[1:06:42] and shall say unto them the god of your
[1:06:45] fathers has sent me
[1:06:46] unto you and they shall say to me what
[1:06:49] is thy name what shall i say
[1:06:52] unto them and god said unto moses
[1:06:55] i am that i am
[1:06:59] and he said shout out thou say unto the
[1:07:03] children of israel
[1:07:04] i am has sent me
[1:07:07] unto you amen so god declares that he
[1:07:12] is the i am
[1:07:15] amen that means that he alone is god
[1:07:19] jesus saying here no man comes to the
[1:07:22] father
[1:07:23] but by me in other words you'll never
[1:07:25] get
[1:07:26] to god unless you go through me
[1:07:31] praise be to god how many knows it's the
[1:07:32] only way
[1:07:34] if through jesus christ
[1:07:37] it is through god there is no
[1:07:40] other way because there is no other
[1:07:44] god god alone
[1:07:47] has eternal life he is the only one that
[1:07:50] is eternal
[1:07:53] amen i want to talk to you for a few
[1:07:55] minutes here basing our thought on
[1:07:57] what a god is first of all we know that
[1:08:00] a god is supposed to be
[1:08:02] immortal now right
[1:08:06] immortal he's supposed to be
[1:08:09] eternal right he's supposed to be
[1:08:13] eternal he's supposed to be all
[1:08:16] powerful he's supposed to be all
[1:08:20] knowing and he's supposed to be
[1:08:23] ever present or all present
[1:08:26] other words for that is omniscient
[1:08:29] all-knowing omnipotent for all power
[1:08:33] and omnipresent for all present
[1:08:39] amen i hope you're ready this morning
[1:08:44] because we're going to have a good
[1:08:44] service
[1:08:47] i am and i know you are too amen
[1:08:51] there's no no no telling just how far we
[1:08:54] can climb this morning
[1:08:55] because when you talk about god hello
[1:08:58] when you begin to talk about god
[1:09:00] you got something to talk about you got
[1:09:03] something to praise about you got
[1:09:04] you got something how many bees we got
[1:09:07] something to talk about
[1:09:09] amen so let's talk about him
[1:09:12] in chapter 44 of isaiah verse 6
[1:09:16] he says thus saith the lord become the
[1:09:19] king of israel
[1:09:20] and his redeemer the lord of hosts
[1:09:24] i am the first and i am the last
[1:09:27] amen praise god i am
[1:09:31] the beginning i am the ending i am the
[1:09:34] alpha
[1:09:34] i am the amiga i mean that all the
[1:09:37] things that the i
[1:09:38] am is i am it's a beginning
[1:09:42] i am it's the ending i am that i am
[1:09:45] i always am i always want i always
[1:09:49] will be he's eternal
[1:09:52] the only way that you will ever be
[1:09:56] eternal the only way you'll ever be
[1:09:59] like a god or an amateur god is to have
[1:10:02] immortal life also and there's only one
[1:10:06] immortality and that
[1:10:08] is in christ jesus god
[1:10:11] is the only one that has eternal life
[1:10:16] this morning
[1:10:19] all right now notice he's not just the i
[1:10:22] am
[1:10:22] but he's also the first he is the last
[1:10:25] he which was
[1:10:26] and who is and which is to come
[1:10:33] calm down you know him huh
[1:10:36] you got him in your heart huh the one
[1:10:38] that was the one that is the one always
[1:10:40] will be
[1:10:40] you got him in your heart you're a part
[1:10:42] of him just calm down
[1:10:44] don't run the aisles amen that alone is
[1:10:47] enough to excite us that alone is enough
[1:10:49] to
[1:10:50] thrill your soul to the utmost
[1:11:02] i am the first i am the last and besides
[1:11:06] me
[1:11:07] there is a few other gods
[1:11:10] you ain't reading with me but you know
[1:11:12] better than that you must be his sheep
[1:11:14] my sheep know my voice and the strangers
[1:11:17] they will not follow
[1:11:21] amen think about this he says and
[1:11:24] besides me
[1:11:25] there is no eternal one
[1:11:28] no omniscient one no omnipotent one
[1:11:32] and then i'm the only god there really
[1:11:35] is
[1:11:39] when i think about our god that we
[1:11:41] determined this morning before there was
[1:11:44] a floor for me to stand on before there
[1:11:46] was an earth for me to stand
[1:11:47] on he already was
[1:11:50] and i know better than to try to take my
[1:11:52] mind back before anything was and how
[1:11:55] far back he goes
[1:11:56] because you can't go that far back you
[1:11:59] can't think that far you'll blow your
[1:12:01] mind
[1:12:05] amen he just was
[1:12:08] do you understand it no better stephen i
[1:12:10] don't understand how jesus always was
[1:12:14] how long was he before he made the earth
[1:12:16] don't ask yourself such stupid questions
[1:12:19] you might get a fuse blowed
[1:12:24] because you're trying to put him in a
[1:12:25] time frame and you can't do it
[1:12:28] even the prophet god said you'll never
[1:12:29] understand it god just ask you to
[1:12:32] believe it that's all he's asking
[1:12:34] he was kind enough to prove to you that
[1:12:36] he is
[1:12:37] through the message of the hour he was
[1:12:39] kind enough to come and show us
[1:12:41] the way amen i mean it was this way
[1:12:45] wasn't didn't come out of pentecostals
[1:12:48] this way didn't come out of baptist or
[1:12:50] methodist or amish or mennonite or
[1:12:51] schwarzenegger
[1:12:52] or or beachy ambush men tonight or horse
[1:12:54] and buggy men tonight or
[1:12:56] however he didn't come out of any of
[1:12:57] that it came separate from all of that
[1:13:00] and he called them out of all of their
[1:13:02] ways and said this is the way
[1:13:04] leave that trash and come here leave
[1:13:07] your lodges and come here
[1:13:09] here is the truth here is the way
[1:13:13] that's what he did called inner
[1:13:15] denominational the prophet of god was
[1:13:18] they may call to all of them but can you
[1:13:20] imagine how any one of those
[1:13:22] churches if god would have done a
[1:13:24] brought a prophet out of those and
[1:13:26] sanctioned that
[1:13:27] how proud they would have been we're the
[1:13:29] ones right no they were all wrong
[1:13:31] there's only one
[1:13:32] right and that's the word of god amen
[1:13:35] there's only one truth there's only one
[1:13:37] way
[1:13:38] not that not many of them
[1:13:41] amen if you choose to
[1:13:46] you can try to go some other way
[1:13:49] climb up some other way but you'll be
[1:13:53] disappointed
[1:13:54] before we talk about that let's talk
[1:13:56] about finish this year first of all
[1:13:58] besides me there is no
[1:14:01] and who as i shall call
[1:14:04] and shall declare it and set it in order
[1:14:08] for me since i
[1:14:11] appointed the ancient people all right
[1:14:15] and the things that are coming
[1:14:21] i mean we serve a god that knows what's
[1:14:24] coming
[1:14:25] he ain't surprised he knows exactly
[1:14:29] what's coming he appoints what's coming
[1:14:31] he tells you what's coming
[1:14:36] oh my can you imagine the day of
[1:14:38] judgment
[1:14:40] you'll say look i told you what was
[1:14:42] coming why didn't you look at what was
[1:14:44] coming
[1:14:44] anybody smart wants to get ready for
[1:14:46] what's coming
[1:14:48] prepares themselves for what's coming
[1:14:51] they already know that god knows all
[1:14:53] things we not even wrote the whole book
[1:14:55] of revelation he talked about
[1:14:57] what the end of the world would be like
[1:14:58] the fire that's going to consume
[1:15:00] everything
[1:15:00] he talked about a thousand year
[1:15:02] millennial reign already
[1:15:04] he talked about a white throne judgment
[1:15:06] do you think an
[1:15:07] atheist is going to stop that
[1:15:10] by saying no there is no god
[1:15:15] no all of their unbelief will never stop
[1:15:18] god
[1:15:20] amen never has stopped it never will
[1:15:25] amen and the things that are coming
[1:15:28] and shall come let them show unto them
[1:15:31] fear ye not neither be afraid have not i
[1:15:34] told thee from that time
[1:15:36] and have declared it even our
[1:15:39] ye are even my witnesses is there a god
[1:15:43] beside me yay there is no god
[1:15:47] i know not any
[1:15:51] praise be to god he didn't know amen he
[1:15:54] says i don't know
[1:15:55] any other god there's no one that's
[1:15:57] immortal that's all powerful
[1:15:58] we know the devil is nothing but a bluff
[1:16:00] he is a false god
[1:16:05] amen now you can make things your gods
[1:16:07] huh
[1:16:08] because even but even god talked about
[1:16:10] don't you fall down and worship the gods
[1:16:12] of egypt
[1:16:14] people have other gods what they call
[1:16:17] gods but they're not really a god
[1:16:21] those wooden images and all that that's
[1:16:23] not really a god that's not going to
[1:16:25] deliver them and can't forgive their sin
[1:16:28] it can't give them joy it can't give
[1:16:30] them happiness
[1:16:31] it can't give them redemption it can't
[1:16:33] give him eternal life
[1:16:36] nothing else can and you can worship an
[1:16:40] idol you can make your house your
[1:16:42] car your wife your children your family
[1:16:45] you can make that your god and if you
[1:16:48] put it before god
[1:16:50] it is your god i mean it was anything
[1:16:53] you put in front of god
[1:16:55] it's an idol and it's your god it's what
[1:16:58] you worship
[1:17:02] amen how many knows it's so
[1:17:05] so important that the one thing we get
[1:17:08] in our hearts
[1:17:09] and that no matter what god is first
[1:17:12] in our lives because if he isn't then he
[1:17:15] hasn't got the rightful place
[1:17:17] amen so to serve a god that always was
[1:17:22] always will be amen
[1:17:26] now let me go one more talk a little
[1:17:28] more in talking about
[1:17:29] god first the other thing that
[1:17:34] we would think and i said to myself i
[1:17:37] was studying this that says god
[1:17:39] cannot be killed a god cannot die
[1:17:44] huh but i found that's not really right
[1:17:49] and yet it is
[1:17:51] [Laughter]
[1:17:53] have i got your mind going
[1:17:57] because how many knows
[1:18:00] all right i'll just read it to you
[1:18:05] revelations 1 and 18 says i am he that
[1:18:08] liveth
[1:18:09] and was dead
[1:18:13] huh i am he that liveth and was dead
[1:18:17] and behold i am alive forevermore amen
[1:18:20] and have the keys of hell
[1:18:22] and of death
[1:18:26] i don't know about you but i like to be
[1:18:27] on the side of the guy that's got the
[1:18:29] keys
[1:18:30] of death and hell i want to be on his
[1:18:34] side
[1:18:35] don't you
[1:18:38] so a god we would think that he could
[1:18:40] not die
[1:18:42] he could not be killed
[1:18:46] so i was back then my study and i was
[1:18:48] thinking
[1:18:50] he can't beat you
[1:18:53] something says well he wasn't killed
[1:18:58] they didn't kill him
[1:19:01] they didn't kill him
[1:19:05] well they did no not really
[1:19:10] because remember jesus said no man
[1:19:15] taketh my life he says i
[1:19:18] laid it down
[1:19:22] in other words if he wouldn't want him
[1:19:24] to do what they did they had never done
[1:19:26] it
[1:19:27] they only did what he allowed him to do
[1:19:30] but it wasn't wasn't like hey we're
[1:19:32] going to get we're going to kill this
[1:19:33] guy and get rid of him we're going to
[1:19:35] murder him
[1:19:36] we're going to surprise him no they
[1:19:37] didn't surprise him they didn't murder
[1:19:39] him
[1:19:40] huh god allowed he led him he said let
[1:19:43] me make this clear
[1:19:45] no man taketh my life from me i am the
[1:19:47] one that's laying it down
[1:19:52] oh my and i thought you know
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:56] what really makes him god what really
[1:19:59] makes him god
[1:20:00] is to be able to die and then he says i
[1:20:03] have the power
[1:20:04] to lay down and i have the power
[1:20:08] to take it back up again now that's a
[1:20:10] god
[1:20:14] no matter how many times you would kill
[1:20:16] him peter he would just get back up
[1:20:19] no matter how many times he allowed you
[1:20:21] to kill him
[1:20:22] he'd get right back up now that's a god
[1:20:25] let's give him a hand said thank you
[1:20:33] amen praise the lord he says i was dead
[1:20:38] but behold i am alive forevermore
[1:20:41] and have the keys of hell and
[1:20:45] of death now if you that god ain't worth
[1:20:48] serving
[1:20:49] then what is that's a god
[1:20:52] worth serving that can lay down his life
[1:20:56] and he's got the power to raise it back
[1:20:58] up again
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:04] now how many knows that in our bodies
[1:21:08] our bodies are very temporal
[1:21:10] it can be killed but the real you and
[1:21:14] we've heard
[1:21:14] the phrase the immortal soul isn't that
[1:21:18] right
[1:21:18] our souls are immortal in other words
[1:21:22] they're not mortal
[1:21:24] your soul is not mortal your soul is
[1:21:27] spiritual
[1:21:28] when this body dies does your soul
[1:21:32] no why because it's immortal
[1:21:36] amen has immortal life but that don't
[1:21:39] mean it has eternal life
[1:21:42] right but that soul will keep on living
[1:21:44] it's spirit form
[1:21:46] spirit form and that right that's what
[1:21:47] god made a living soul
[1:21:50] amen and the bible talks about until
[1:21:53] judgment
[1:21:54] i mean it was until judgment that soul
[1:21:56] will live
[1:21:58] it'll have it'll it'll it has immortal
[1:22:00] life
[1:22:02] but the bible says the soul that sinneth
[1:22:05] it shall surely
[1:22:08] die the second death
[1:22:12] that soul will that immortal immortality
[1:22:15] so to speak
[1:22:16] will eventually die unless your soul
[1:22:20] receives
[1:22:21] eternal how many wants that say that's
[1:22:24] what i'm looking for that's what i'm
[1:22:26] striving for
[1:22:27] is for that eternal life
[1:22:31] amen praise be
[1:22:34] to god amen
[1:22:42] in that same message brother bram said
[1:22:44] something i really like
[1:22:46] the only quote that i have this morning
[1:22:49] he makes a statement he says
[1:22:53] this is 31 years i've been preaching
[1:22:57] and i would not trade this life if there
[1:22:59] wasn't any heaven to go to
[1:23:01] at the end
[1:23:06] if there wasn't any jesus to see
[1:23:09] i have more joy living this way in one
[1:23:12] day than i would with 10 years the other
[1:23:15] way
[1:23:16] if there wasn't nothing after this
[1:23:18] that's really from my heart
[1:23:20] as your brother and god's servant
[1:23:23] he said there is such a peace and
[1:23:27] a satisfaction
[1:23:30] amen remember a couple weeks of recall
[1:23:32] we preached on
[1:23:33] dissatisfied people and satisfaction and
[1:23:36] so forth
[1:23:37] because how many knows that has such a
[1:23:39] bearing in
[1:23:40] our lives whether or not we're satisfied
[1:23:47] whether there's
[1:23:48] joy whether you have joy and happiness
[1:23:52] and satisfaction in your life has a
[1:23:55] great
[1:23:55] big bearing because all those people out
[1:23:59] there that you see

[1:24:26] some satisfaction find some happiness

[1:24:31] says they're so dismantle
[1:24:32] they're reaching for something and they
[1:24:34] can't never
[1:24:36] get it they don't never get it
[1:24:40] i'll be honest with you if i wasn't here
[1:24:44] this morning and if i didn't know god it
[1:24:46] ain't no telling what i'd look like
[1:24:48] i'm not beyond putting the error vote
[1:24:51] yes i am i don't care if i was a sinner
[1:24:53] i wouldn't do it thoughts on that
[1:24:59] i don't know about tattoos but you don't
[1:25:01] know how far you go i wouldn't know how
[1:25:02] far i'd go would we
[1:25:04] what we do because you all know i was
[1:25:06] crazy when i was out in the world
[1:25:08] anyway crazy stuff
[1:25:12] and so you know think about where you
[1:25:14] would be where i would be how what i
[1:25:16] would look like
[1:25:17] the tattoos probably and everything else
[1:25:19] hello
[1:25:20] because i never got any satisfaction but
[1:25:23] thank god
[1:25:24] i've still got my eyeballs like they're
[1:25:27] supposed to be and
[1:25:28] my nose no rings in it and satisfied
[1:25:34] because of him because i found the way
[1:25:38] to have joy the way they have peace
[1:25:43] and brother branham was saying look at
[1:25:44] the peace look at that look how that you
[1:25:46] can
[1:25:46] let me finish your quote lay down in
[1:25:49] your bed and just
[1:25:51] you know that's really from my heart as
[1:25:53] your brother and god's servant
[1:25:55] there's such a peace and a satisfaction
[1:25:57] knowing that when you lay down
[1:25:59] if you never wake up again what
[1:26:01] difference does it make
[1:26:04] amen i hope everybody here can lay down
[1:26:07] in their beds and sleep at night and
[1:26:09] know that hey if an
[1:26:10] airplane falls out of the sky and hits
[1:26:13] your house
[1:26:14] you're ready to go that's all right
[1:26:18] huh no matter what happens
[1:26:21] you have such a peace if we can actually
[1:26:24] get
[1:26:24] if we can get this kind of peace this
[1:26:27] kind of happiness
[1:26:30] brother bram says even if there's
[1:26:31] nothing do it this is how i want to be
[1:26:40] i am quiet for a few minutes because i
[1:26:42] want you to soak in
[1:26:44] and find out whether you're there or not
[1:26:46] i want you to look at your heart and
[1:26:48] your life
[1:26:48] and see whether you're there or not
[1:26:51] that you've obtained such happiness such
[1:26:55] joy such peace
[1:26:58] until even if there was no having to go
[1:27:00] to i'd still want to be
[1:27:01] like this this is how i want to live
[1:27:06] because i can sleep i can be happy
[1:27:11] because this peace is real this joy is
[1:27:14] real
[1:27:16] god is real
[1:27:19] amen praise the lord
[1:27:24] there's an anchor that holds within the
[1:27:28] veil
[1:27:28] somewhere amen out there
[1:27:32] and there's something that tells us
[1:27:34] there's something good
[1:27:36] on the other side amen
[1:27:43] all right
[1:27:48] i am the way the truth
[1:27:53] and the life amen
[1:27:56] in john 10 it says verily verily i say
[1:27:59] unto you he that
[1:28:00] entereth not by the door and to the
[1:28:02] sheepfold but climb it up some other way
[1:28:05] the same is a thief and a robber
[1:28:09] amen but he that entereth in by the door
[1:28:13] is the shepherd of the sheep to him the
[1:28:16] porter openeth
[1:28:17] the sheep hear his voice and he calleth
[1:28:19] his own sheep by name
[1:28:21] and leadeth them out i say that
[1:28:28] in that way because i as i read that
[1:28:31] i think about how that the lord
[1:28:36] by name thomas
[1:28:39] thomas where are you
[1:28:42] pinecraft sarasota
[1:28:46] thomas thomas where are you
[1:28:50] i begin to thirst in my heart i said
[1:28:53] there's got to be more to van halen and
[1:28:55] ac dc and rock and roll and dope and
[1:28:56] everything
[1:28:57] got to be more to life than this got to
[1:29:00] be something greater it's got to be
[1:29:01] something better
[1:29:03] i mean i begin to thirst for god i begin
[1:29:06] to
[1:29:07] search for god i realized later after
[1:29:10] god saved me that it was him calling
[1:29:14] amen no man comes to the father but by
[1:29:17] me and nobody can come to me except my
[1:29:19] father
[1:29:21] draw him i realize how he's being drawn
[1:29:25] god calls he'll calls you by name
[1:29:29] if god don't call you by name if god
[1:29:31] doesn't tug on you
[1:29:32] yeah every church service will be a bore
[1:29:38] do we gotta do that again do we gotta do
[1:29:40] that oh it'll be a bar
[1:29:42] and no matter how much you try to be a
[1:29:44] christian and pretend that you're a
[1:29:46] christian unless uh god gets ahold of
[1:29:48] you
[1:29:48] that's all you'll ever be doing is
[1:29:50] pretending
[1:29:52] to be a christian trying to be a
[1:29:55] christian
[1:29:57] and you're not really that on the inside
[1:30:00] you fight that it find that it's a
[1:30:01] constant battle
[1:30:03] all the time now it's important that we
[1:30:07] go by the way how many knows
[1:30:08] you've got to go by the way what is the
[1:30:11] way
[1:30:13] straight is the gate narrow is the way
[1:30:17] amen you got to come in by the door
[1:30:19] there's one door to come into
[1:30:21] and jesus says i am the door to the
[1:30:23] sheepfold
[1:30:25] how many knows he is the door i am
[1:30:28] the way i am the door to the sheepfold
[1:30:31] if you try to go in some other way
[1:30:34] amen you're going to be disappointed how
[1:30:37] many beliefs he said he who the son sets
[1:30:39] free
[1:30:40] is free indeed i mean
[1:30:43] you'll never find true freedom all those
[1:30:45] other religions that are trying to find
[1:30:48] freedom they'll never be able to achieve
[1:30:51] it
[1:30:52] like the prophet said as long as you're
[1:30:54] entrusting you baptist church methodist
[1:30:56] church
[1:30:56] any of your church if you're trusting in
[1:30:58] your church for your salvation
[1:31:00] you are lost but if you're trusting in
[1:31:04] jesus christ you're saved
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:10] the devil offers many substitute ways
[1:31:14] many other ways to enter in and amen
[1:31:17] until
[1:31:18] i'll tell you what people are so pretty
[1:31:20] prone i
[1:31:21] am prone you are prone if you really
[1:31:24] search your life
[1:31:25] it meant to be and take our own
[1:31:28] way
[1:31:32] amen there's only one true way
[1:31:36] that's his way praise be to god
[1:31:42] people tried everything people try to
[1:31:44] get to heaven in
[1:31:45] every imaginable way you can imagine
[1:31:49] how about during over the philippines i
[1:31:52] think it is
[1:31:52] how that during uh easter and so forth
[1:31:55] the different ones that go beating
[1:31:56] themselves on their back you know and
[1:31:58] you know whipping themselves and
[1:32:00] bleeding and everything else and
[1:32:03] trying to die to themselves i don't care
[1:32:05] how deep you cut yourself
[1:32:07] i don't care how much misery you put to
[1:32:09] yourself through
[1:32:10] you did it for absolutely zero nothing
[1:32:14] didn't do one bit of good for your sins
[1:32:18] the only way to do any good is to
[1:32:21] believe and
[1:32:22] accept the strikes that were put on his
[1:32:25] back
[1:32:26] except how he suffered for you that's
[1:32:28] the only way that you'll ever get it
[1:32:32] no other way no other truth
[1:32:35] no other life if you want joe ma
[1:32:39] this is going to be good if you truly
[1:32:41] want the joy of the lord
[1:32:43] you'll never get it until you get it his
[1:32:45] way
[1:32:46] you want peace that passes understanding
[1:32:49] you don't get it the way you want to get
[1:32:51] it you got to come the way he says for
[1:32:52] you to get it
[1:32:54] it's only through him that you have
[1:32:56] peace with god
[1:32:58] justification amen
[1:33:02] i'm so glad for that
[1:33:06] oh my i like that that meant a lot to me
[1:33:10] he calleth his own sheep by name
[1:33:14] i could just dwell on that for a while
[1:33:16] if god ever calls you god ever saves you
[1:33:19] you become a child of god i do not
[1:33:22] believe that there's enough devils out
[1:33:24] of hell
[1:33:25] that can never deviate you from that
[1:33:28] they get you to be lost because he says
[1:33:32] no man can pluck them out of my all the
[1:33:34] father has given me
[1:33:35] will come to me and i will lose a none
[1:33:37] of them
[1:33:38] i like i like that because it's not
[1:33:41] counting on me
[1:33:43] my word is his word he won't no man can
[1:33:47] pluck him out of my hand
[1:33:50] know how we could go on go ahead try to
[1:33:52] burn them at the stake alive
[1:33:54] what torture what cruel torture to be
[1:33:56] burnt
[1:33:57] alive but thousands of our brothers and
[1:34:00] sisters were burnt alive
[1:34:02] isn't that right fed to lions and they
[1:34:04] just wouldn't give it up
[1:34:07] they would not recant why because
[1:34:09] there's something in there that
[1:34:10] is an anchor how many is glad to have
[1:34:13] that anchor in your life
[1:34:17] there's not enough hypocrites in the
[1:34:18] church to make you quit
[1:34:21] there's not enough people that claim to
[1:34:22] be christians and aren't really
[1:34:24] they may cause you to stumble and no it
[1:34:26] won't never never not you
[1:34:28] doesn't matter well the preacher's a
[1:34:31] hypocrite that won't even stumble
[1:34:33] you'll keep right on going even if he is
[1:34:37] not a real crowd amen
[1:34:41] the same way vice versa amen
[1:34:45] well i'm not a christian because so and
[1:34:47] so no no no
[1:34:48] if you ever really anchor you'll get
[1:34:50] through that you'll come out on the
[1:34:52] other side
[1:34:53] you'll be all right god will take you
[1:34:54] through because if you're taking
[1:34:55] yourself through yeah you're gonna be
[1:34:57] gone
[1:34:57] but if he's taking you through that's a
[1:34:58] whole different story that's right keep
[1:35:00] your seat for that
[1:35:01] just relax don't get too excited
[1:35:06] praise be to god oh my
[1:35:10] all right and when he putteth forth his
[1:35:11] own sheep he goeth before them
[1:35:14] and the sheep follow him
[1:35:17] for they know his voice how many believe
[1:35:20] that that's if i'm preaching the truth
[1:35:23] that's what you're following am i right
[1:35:26] that's what you're following it's the
[1:35:28] truth that's being proved
[1:35:29] because if i didn't preach the truth you
[1:35:31] wouldn't be following it
[1:35:33] you wouldn't be following i wouldn't
[1:35:34] follow and unless it's the truth
[1:35:37] it's got to be the truth it's got to be
[1:35:38] the way
[1:35:40] amen all right
[1:35:45] and the sheep follow him for they know
[1:35:48] his voice that's why i say whenever
[1:35:51] i read my bible i know it was the truth
[1:35:54] i know that
[1:35:55] i believe that bible is the truth i
[1:35:57] don't believe it
[1:35:59] predicts itself if it contradicts itself
[1:36:04] if it contradicts itself and i think it
[1:36:06] contradicts itself
[1:36:09] you know what i do sister becky i tell
[1:36:11] myself
[1:36:12] thomas your mind ain't right
[1:36:16] i tell myself you're the ones confident
[1:36:19] you don't understand something about it
[1:36:22] because i believe that way before i
[1:36:24] believe it contradicts itself
[1:36:27] amen i'll tell myself self you need to
[1:36:30] straighten up because that ain't
[1:36:31] i believe that that's guys i'm hanging
[1:36:33] my soul on it
[1:36:35] my eternal destination on it
[1:36:40] amen and when we heard the prophet's
[1:36:42] message play a tape
[1:36:43] play a tape and see and let's listen to
[1:36:45] that voice
[1:36:47] if you're a sheep you'll pick it up
[1:36:49] you'll know that
[1:36:50] that sounds right that's the truth no
[1:36:53] denomination is going to save you
[1:36:54] no organizations they're a big bunch of
[1:36:56] prostitutes that's right the bible says
[1:36:58] said
[1:36:59] the mother of harlots mother had a bunch
[1:37:00] of prostitutes amen they claim to be
[1:37:02] married to christ and go around there
[1:37:04] go uptown stand out there inside of them
[1:37:07] churches whenever they go and find out
[1:37:08] if them women ain't
[1:37:09] got mini skirts half up their leg and
[1:37:11] they make any man lust after him
[1:37:13] huh preacher ain't never preaching again
[1:37:16] saying no he wants
[1:37:17] to stay there because the deacon board
[1:37:20] will the board
[1:37:21] trust these everybody throw him out if
[1:37:22] you don't if he preaches that's up
[1:37:26] hello claiming to be christ and then not
[1:37:29] obey his word
[1:37:31] jesus says why do you call me lord and
[1:37:33] then don't do what i tell you to do
[1:37:35] and paul says let anybody that's
[1:37:36] spiritual acknowledge that the things
[1:37:38] that we write unto you
[1:37:39] are the commandments of the lord amen
[1:37:42] and the way you dress and the way you do
[1:37:44] your hair and everything else
[1:37:46] amen they're all the commandments of the
[1:37:47] lord
[1:37:49] because god had chosen paul to be his
[1:37:51] servant to write
[1:37:53] most of the new testament amen
[1:37:56] praise the lord
[1:38:00] all right
[1:38:03] praise the lord this morning so we got
[1:38:06] to come his way
[1:38:08] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:38:10] way
[1:38:11] prophet taught us and i didn't pick this
[1:38:12] up before but he said s-t-r-a-i-t
[1:38:16] is a strait or a waterway
[1:38:20] right it's a waterway amen and they're
[1:38:23] even singing a song about the waterway
[1:38:25] is the way today buried in the precious
[1:38:28] name of jesus
[1:38:30] young and old repent of all your sins
[1:38:32] amen and jesus will truly come and enter
[1:38:34] in
[1:38:35] but listen straight is the gate narrow
[1:38:38] is the way
[1:38:39] by the way the water and the blood now
[1:38:41] the water don't save you
[1:38:43] but still re go into all the world
[1:38:46] preach the gospel to every creature he
[1:38:48] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:38:50] saved
[1:38:51] the water day acts 2 38 repent every one
[1:38:54] of you and be baptized in the name of
[1:38:55] the lord jesus christ for the remission
[1:38:57] of your sins
[1:38:58] and you shall receive the holy ghost the
[1:39:00] promise is to you
[1:39:01] to your children to them that are far
[1:39:03] off even as many as the lord are god
[1:39:05] shall call
[1:39:07] now in brother branham's time there was
[1:39:08] everybody was preaching that the days of
[1:39:10] miracles has passed
[1:39:12] and the holy ghost was only for those
[1:39:14] apostles and disciples
[1:39:15] there is no holy ghost anymore and the
[1:39:18] prophet says guys show you where god put
[1:39:20] it in there
[1:39:21] you show me where he took it out it's
[1:39:24] for you
[1:39:24] for you for your children to them that
[1:39:26] are false
[1:39:27] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:39:30] call
[1:39:31] how many believes the holy ghost is for
[1:39:32] today not just for yesterday
[1:39:35] they're trying to get you to amen and
[1:39:37] the nicean council i believe is three
[1:39:40] hundred years after the death of christ
[1:39:42] amen 19 they had a council
[1:39:43] and they instituted the baptism amen to
[1:39:46] be the father the son and the holy ghost
[1:39:49] we got this here going everywhere
[1:39:51] doesn't mean a thing
[1:39:54] except it's the wrong way amen that's
[1:39:57] the wrong way
[1:39:58] there's one there's only one name given
[1:40:01] under heaven whereby you must be saved
[1:40:04] and that is the name of the father the
[1:40:05] son and the holy ghost
[1:40:07] and the name of the father and the son
[1:40:08] of the holy ghost is the lord jesus
[1:40:11] christ
[1:40:16] amen try to get in some other way
[1:40:19] hey maybe in the days gone by when we
[1:40:21] were ignorant didn't know better god
[1:40:23] winked in our ignorance but he doesn't
[1:40:25] today
[1:40:27] not one person was ever about in the
[1:40:29] titles
[1:40:30] of father son and the holy ghost in the
[1:40:32] bible not
[1:40:33] a one why would you want to be why would
[1:40:36] you want to dive into a pond that's
[1:40:38] never been proven
[1:40:39] huh nobody ever did it yet you think you
[1:40:43] can get in there and climb up some other
[1:40:44] way no
[1:40:45] there is many of them that's climbing
[1:40:47] other ways
[1:40:50] hello
[1:40:53] praise be to god
[1:40:57] praise be to god
[1:41:01] people are trying to get peace in their
[1:41:03] hearts
[1:41:04] some other way they're trying to get
[1:41:06] salvation some other way
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:09] but what did jesus say what was some of
[1:41:11] the things that he said that if you come
[1:41:13] my way then there the way is kind of
[1:41:15] narrow it's kind of a
[1:41:17] tight path here okay and that path
[1:41:20] first of all he says if you love father
[1:41:23] mother brother
[1:41:24] sister wife or children huh
[1:41:28] if you love the pleasures of this world
[1:41:30] if you love money if you love anything
[1:41:32] else
[1:41:32] more than you love me don't expect to
[1:41:35] get in
[1:41:40] pretty tight path and you know it gets
[1:41:43] tighter than that
[1:41:44] yeah it gets tighter than that because
[1:41:46] after that he says
[1:41:48] yeah and he that doesn't take up his
[1:41:50] cross and follow me
[1:41:51] and he that hateth not his own life also
[1:41:55] i like that thank you jesus
[1:41:57] you let us know that we can't just
[1:41:58] forsake everybody else
[1:42:00] we gotta forsake our own way we gotta
[1:42:02] forsake our own life
[1:42:04] you gotta forget your own thoughts
[1:42:08] you gotta die to your own self if you
[1:42:10] wanna follow him
[1:42:11] or you're not gonna make it in
[1:42:16] pretty tight straight narrow path
[1:42:22] oh my i could do like that preacher amen
[1:42:25] that preached on repentance for
[1:42:26] two months and the congregation says
[1:42:28] peach when are you gonna quit
[1:42:30] preaching on repentance and and he said
[1:42:33] well let everybody repent
[1:42:34] and then we'll go somewhere else
[1:42:39] hallelujah or help us this morning that
[1:42:41] we might forget
[1:42:42] everything else and say god i don't want
[1:42:44] to live my own life i don't want to
[1:42:46] think my own thoughts
[1:42:47] i want to get there not just talk about
[1:42:49] a beer about it or let me get to the
[1:42:51] place to where i truly am
[1:42:53] dead to my own self dead to my own
[1:42:55] thoughts straight to my own ways
[1:42:57] into my own life because that's the only
[1:43:00] way that you're ever
[1:43:01] gonna get real joy the baptism of the
[1:43:04] holy ghost
[1:43:05] amen that'll bring it here and it'll be
[1:43:07] so hard so heavy on youtube a little
[1:43:09] quick in your immortal body
[1:43:10] hey man it'll take a 80 year old man i
[1:43:12] mean they're making me take his shoes
[1:43:14] together
[1:43:14] and say hallelujah ain't got enough room
[1:43:16] for me to preach up here
[1:43:18] that's what the holy ghost will do the
[1:43:21] holy ghost is alive in you
[1:43:23] amen it does something for you when you
[1:43:26] really go the right path
[1:43:28] when you're really going the right way
[1:43:30] when you go that narrow path

[1:45:41] i haven't given god time to study like i
[1:45:43] should and pray like i should
[1:45:45] i'm sorry huh it's so easy
[1:45:49] to let other things come first isn't
[1:45:52] that right
[1:45:53] get so busy until we don't have time to
[1:45:55] pray
[1:45:56] till we don't have time to say god that
[1:45:58] all i just want you to know
[1:46:00] that i love you is all in my heart but
[1:46:02] even though i was that way i says i know
[1:46:04] lord i believe i have confidence you'll
[1:46:06] give me what i need in the morning
[1:46:08] amen i was tired folks i don't know
[1:46:10] about you but it's hard to study when

[1:46:32] us
[1:46:33] amen praise be to god so when i think
[1:46:36] about god
[1:46:37] when i think about me he is the i am
[1:46:40] that everything
[1:46:41] that was created was created by him
[1:46:44] without him there was not anything made
[1:46:46] that was made
[1:46:48] oh when i think about how he made your
[1:46:50] breath oh my
[1:46:52] he made your voice he made everything
[1:46:55] that you
[1:46:55] are he gave us everything
[1:46:59] and then we get more excited about some
[1:47:01] things
[1:47:03] other things more then we get excited
[1:47:06] about him
[1:47:08] huh oh i don't know about you

[1:47:27] god
[1:47:28] huh you ought to be a little more
[1:47:30] excited in the house of god than it is
[1:47:32] out there
[1:47:33] that's exactly right because you think
[1:47:35] that you are serving a god that
[1:47:37] has saved you that has made you immortal
[1:47:39] not only immortal but he has created in
[1:47:42] you
[1:47:42] and made you a part of himself and that
[1:47:44] from a million years from now
[1:47:46] you'll still be saying amazing queen the
[1:47:50] sound
[1:47:50] that saved a wretch like me oh i'm
[1:47:53] telling you right now i'm gonna bellow
[1:47:55] down through those
[1:47:56] echoes of those mountains and those
[1:47:58] valleys and it's gonna rebound
[1:48:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:05] hello and i'm gonna hear a sound back
[1:48:07] somewhere
[1:48:10] that's right he's gonna go back and
[1:48:11] we're gonna pray god through the eons of
[1:48:13] time
[1:48:14] amen because he didn't work at us
[1:48:16] because we found the path
[1:48:17] we found the way we found the truth we
[1:48:20] found the life
[1:48:24] oh my by the grace of god
[1:48:28] there's no other way but him only by the
[1:48:31] holy ghost how many knows him he is the
[1:48:33] holy ghost
[1:48:37] oh my he is the holy spirit
[1:48:40] he is the pillar of fire he came down
[1:48:42] and he divided himself
[1:48:44] up on the day of patton and pentecost in
[1:48:45] his church
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:48] no there is no deliverance
[1:48:53] without him there is no
[1:48:57] unshackling your feet unshackling those
[1:49:02] chains of sin that binds you
[1:49:09] there's no unshackling don't even make a
[1:49:12] big step because you're shackled so
[1:49:14] tight by condemnation
[1:49:17] so shackled up
[1:49:21] till the word of god you can't even
[1:49:24] squeeze out a
[1:49:26] amen
[1:49:30] so so tightened up by the cares of this
[1:49:33] life that it's
[1:49:34] choked out your love and life for the
[1:49:37] lord
[1:49:39] we ought to be we ought to be crying
[1:49:43] we ought to be walking the house raising
[1:49:45] our heads saying thank you jesus thank
[1:49:48] you jesus thank you lord
[1:49:51] thank you for what you have done in my
[1:49:52] heart thank you for what you have done

[1:49:57] because you're the only one that can set
[1:49:59] free yeah i am the deliverer of israel
[1:50:03] and besides me there is no god there is
[1:50:05] no deliverer
[1:50:06] there is no savior i mean believe he's
[1:50:10] the only savior there is
[1:50:12] nobody else can save you nothing else
[1:50:14] can save you nothing else can deliver
[1:50:16] you nothing else can set you free
[1:50:19] what did brother bram say about us

[1:50:22] we are not free
[1:50:24] we're bound by the cares of life and
[1:50:25] everything else we're so bogged down
[1:50:28] with everything we're not free

[1:50:54] something that you get used to
[1:50:56] something that becomes common to you
[1:50:59] don't let it become common to you
[1:51:01] because if it's becoming common to you
[1:51:03] it's because you're getting further away
[1:51:05] from it
[1:51:10] i thank god i'd rather write that every
[1:51:12] time i get away from god i get formal
[1:51:14] i get this out of the other there's
[1:51:15] something that pulls
[1:51:17] me something that said no you can't do
[1:51:20] that don't you die on me brother

[1:52:09] need a little more dying i need to find

[1:52:47] heart you have joy in your life
[1:52:49] you're gonna expect it
[1:52:53] hey man there's something in there but
[1:52:55] if you don't have joy you don't have
[1:52:57] peace
[1:53:00] then you're not going to express it i
[1:53:03] believe we ought to be worshiping god
[1:53:05] like never before amen
[1:53:08] didn't jesus say you know they were
[1:53:10] worshiping to the woman at the well
[1:53:12] would they worship here
[1:53:13] they worship there he says in the
[1:53:14] mountain but he says you know the day is
[1:53:16] going to come that they're not going to
[1:53:17] worship here
[1:53:18] but they're not going to worship there
[1:53:19] but they're going to worship in
[1:53:21] spirit and in truth
[1:53:25] that's what they're going to worship
[1:53:26] when they hear
[1:53:28] the truth
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:32] praise be to god oh
[1:53:35] my brother brother you get a little loud
[1:53:41] till you get over there it's gonna sound
[1:53:43] like
[1:53:44] thunder like the voice of mighty
[1:53:48] mighty host of people
[1:53:51] we're not gonna be quiet over there
[1:53:54] no we're gonna worship god we're gonna
[1:53:57] praise him
[1:53:58] let everything that has breath
[1:54:03] praise the lord i will
[1:54:06] enter his gates with the frown on my
[1:54:10] face
[1:54:13] no i will enter his gate with
[1:54:15] thanksgiving in my heart
[1:54:18] this is the day this is the day that the
[1:54:20] lord hath made
[1:54:22] we will be sad
[1:54:25] we will be sad in it no we will be glad
[1:54:28] in it
[1:54:30] hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice
[1:54:33] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:54:35] let us rejoice to be glad because why we
[1:54:37] serve a god that is immortal that is
[1:54:39] eternal
[1:54:41] he is not was but he is the i am and he
[1:54:44] is here
[1:54:45] right now
[1:54:51] where is he where's god
[1:54:55] two hands come on folks where is he
[1:54:57] that's right
[1:55:00] that's right that's where he is i love
[1:55:03] it when you get the revelation
[1:55:05] that's where he is because the god that
[1:55:07] delivers now
[1:55:08] the god that sets free he is now in your
[1:55:11] heart
[1:55:11] amen he uses your vessel to bring
[1:55:14] deliverance to your neighbor
[1:55:15] you bring deliverance to your chapter to
[1:55:17] bring me deliverance to the milkman the
[1:55:19] mailman
[1:55:21] to your workers to your jaws perhaps he
[1:55:24] brings deliverance
[1:55:27] that's why amen brother irvin we've
[1:55:30] gotten away from bringing
[1:55:32] deliverance to the people telling people
[1:55:35] about how the day can be free
[1:55:37] amen and god has sent us a message this
[1:55:40] hour
[1:55:41] to set people free we're part of that
[1:55:44] body how many knows
[1:55:45] even god used the prophet of god so much
[1:55:47] that he could discern the thoughts and
[1:55:48] intents of the heart
[1:55:49] so much until he thought that he was the
[1:55:51] messiah that was a pardon brother brown

[1:59:40] impressed
[1:59:41] with the god that we serve he's awesome
[1:59:44] god
[1:59:45] he can answer every prayer that you have
[1:59:49] he says whatsoever things you desire

[2:00:27] to the prophet he pointed us
[2:00:29] to christ amen how am i glad that you
[2:00:32] have a relationship with jesus christ
[2:00:34] through the prophet in this hour through
[2:00:36] the word of god you have a relationship
[2:00:38] with him and you're not just serving
[2:00:40] some god of the past but we're serving
[2:00:42] the god

[2:01:19] have you obtained that which you have
[2:01:22] striven for

[2:01:42] to say to you
[2:01:43] perhaps you're not going about it the
[2:01:45] right way
[2:01:47] because jesus said he was the door
[2:01:52] and he said ask and it shall be given
[2:01:55] unto you
[2:01:56] he says seek and ye
[2:01:59] he shall find he said if you'll knock

[2:02:35] have
[2:02:35] be able to think thoughts that it's not
[2:02:37] supposed to think
[2:02:39] my mouth and it won't say things it
[2:02:41] shouldn't say
[2:02:43] my heart that it wouldn't take anything
[2:02:45] that he wasn't supposed to take in lord
[2:02:48] but father that your perfect way would
[2:02:51] always
[2:02:51] be in front of me lord and also each and
[2:02:54] every one that has raised their hand i
[2:02:56] pray god if they have asked if they have
[2:02:58] knocked if they have sought and have not
[2:03:00] received and are not in the place that
[2:03:02] they should be with you this morning
[2:03:04] i pray god that as they raise their hand
[2:03:08] and say god

[2:03:12] my eyes
[2:03:14] and show me the way lord help me to be
[2:03:17] sensitive enough to know

[2:03:22] and to show us hey this is the area
[2:03:24] that's keeping you

[2:03:37] god where we're still in the way where
[2:03:39] we're still thinking our thoughts
[2:03:41] but we're still having our ways lord and
[2:03:44] we're not getting in
[2:03:45] we're not getting satisfaction we're not
[2:03:47] getting joy we're not getting peace
[2:03:49] because we're going about it the wrong
