amen that's good amen i believe you ought to be married all the time amen and i tell you what you know it's true i mean it's i've heard that it ought to be christmas all year round yeah people have better attitudes around christmas and all that well but i have that all the time right you know they have father's day they have mother's day and even brother branham i think i said mother's day he says you know i respect mom every day of the year not just once a year so amen there's something that's in us year around 24 7. in trouble with uh sound system and i mean at the sound system but the internet so it's half really working decent mica we had an appointment for january the 6th to get somebody in here we were on a phone with the tech or technician or somebody uh for quite a while micah had to run down here while he was on the phone and do what he could to try to get it fixed and he was in and out but right now it's working so praise the lord amen so tyler came back up so let's run the car or some more shall we amen god's good amen let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you father tonight thank the lord jesus to be able to gather once again with your children father to worship you father to adore you to magnify you to praise you to glorify you lord lord we know that you inhabit the praise of your people lord father and we just we just can't do it enough we just can't express in our hearts and our lives lord enough gratitude and enough worship father for all that you have done and for what you are and what you mean to us lord and we just ask god tonight that you would help us to grasp a little bit more father of what you are and how great you are how wonderful you are and what you've done for us lord jesus and what you've made available to us fathom we just ask god now that you just help me to get out of the way lord and be with each one that has come lord jesus that loves you and loves to come into your house and and lord to listen to your word to feed on what you have father and we ask god that you'll bless the meditation of my heart and that which i feel lord you've laid upon my heart to speak we just ask for you to speak and say what you once said tonight lord when we give you thanks and praise and honor and glory for all your good many blessings in jesus name amen amen so if you will we want to try to uh encumber so to speak one of another part of our series amen another part of our series one of the titles of god or one of the things that god calls himself or says that he is amen along with a christmas message so amen we want to just try to do that one more time i thought well i got to thinking about thinking about it and it just kind of come together so i hope that it'll be a blessing to you we'll turn if our bibles if you will to um let me see let's go to luke 2 luke 2 we'll start with the christmas so to call christmas scene or the very first gift that god gave to man amen in luke 2 and we'll begin from 8 down to verse 14. and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping much over their flock by night and lo the angels of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david as savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling cloth lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace and good will towers men may god at his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen tonight we want to deal with uh why one of some of the reasons uh both of why people have rejected and have rejected this wonderful gift that god gave amen you know because truly that that's what they did how many knows and you know when i when i as a minister the more i look look at what people do with god and the way they treat him right the more pathetic it is the more it shows the patheticness of humanity right i mean it's really it's terrible now first of all i say and reject it you know let me i'll just read one scripture here uh in isaiah 53 and 3 it says that he is despised and rejected of men right never said accept it now we know a few do right but in general it's pro the prophecy was that he was despised and that he was rejected of many men of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not amen surely he hath borne our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed now i'll get into that second part there amen uh verse 5 about being wounded and all but later but the part that i want to get to is first the rejection the rejection of this wonderful gift this first christmas gift that was ever gave to man the greatest gift that could have ever been given amen uh all of the heavenly hosts were singing and so forth but we find we know the story of how that mary and joseph went to pay taxes in their hometown and so forth and there was no room for him in the end right we all remember that story of how there was no more room you know and they had to go rent a stable right they go out into stable and put some straw down i don't know if they had to clean out all the manure first or not but they had to rent a stable and get waddling cloth with what they put around the ox and then the you know their their neck before that put their main thing on from the pool it's just some cloth i'm on the cloth like they have and he was wrapped in that amen so it was very a very very humble scene isn't that right it was god brought uh jesus christ to the world through humility amen and through a little uh a virgin mary they were not rich how many know joseph was a carpenter and neither one of them were wealthy they were considered poor people amen so there were some poor people there and and jesus born in a stable and so forth and and you know it just didn't look like what god was going to do when he was going to do the greatest thing he ever did i mean it was just so simple and so humble and that was one of the reasons that jesus christ was rejected was because it didn't come in pomp it didn't come in uh flashy things as brother brown said around christmas everything has to be sparkly everything has to be shiny everything has to be all of that he didn't come that way at all and then we see the end of jesus let's look at the end of jesus the end of jesus was that even his own disciples left him they even forsook him that right just about everybody forsook him he had nobody hardly on his side but me but maybe his mama going up beside him or going to calvary and still talking about it what has he ever done and so forth right but he was completely rejected the bible says in saint john sit down the first chapter and he came to his own and his own what received him not people now i want to look at that with the help of the lord amen now i'm going to try to do something this evening i want to start basically with a uh with a quote from brother branham he was preaching i believe it was on god's wrath gift listen he says this is now why was the reason they didn't receive this rap gift why what's the reason for it they knowed what was on the inside of it right and it didn't this is this key word that i want to go off of tonight they didn't want it they didn't want it now they knew what was inside of it they knew what he really was because nicodemus came to him at night and he was of the pharisees and what did he admit he just said we know that you're a man of god we know that you're of god because nobody could do these things unless he was of god but did they receive him even though they knew it was right they still didn't want it and that want is what i want to try to uh define a little bit the meaning of want all right the meaning of what to me now this is maybe not according to the dictionary but this is according to me is to desire right it's to once you desire something you even even thirst can be brought in because there's something that you just gotta have it's say something something not in your soul and you just got to have it you want it or you don't want it right so it's a desire so tonight i want to tell you that i believe the core problem with rejecting god is people's desire it's what they hunger for it's what they thirst for well when the lord started showing me this stuff i'm having a good time isn't that right they didn't want it they didn't want jesus one of the big reasons was because it did not come the way that they thought it ought to come folks how many knows that don't never get in your mind that this is how it ought to be when it comes to god you better come and find out how does he want it to be many times they thought the messiah would come down on the red carpet and god would say k ephesus here is my messiah he's going to deliver israel we're going to drive these romans out and we're going to have our own jerusalem and everything yet wasn't nothing like it not even close not even the red devils of what they thought it was going to be it came down so humble and when it did come it absolutely condemned them for the way that they were doing they sure didn't think that was going to happen but it didn't come their way not the way that they wanted it to come folks i'm telling you right now you know didn't brother bam say one place he said when you think you got the rapture all figured out just remember you're probably wrong huh so you got to have an open heart lord you pay for things sometimes let me tell you this sometimes you'll pray for things and i believe god hears you and i believe god answers you but it don't come the way that you think it does a lot of times it don't happen the way that you want it to and you got to be open say lord it doesn't happen well it just comes to my mind and now what it says not my will be done but dying not doing it i want it but let your way be done let your desire be done the whole problem of the whole world is that word want it's what they want because people are going to do what they want isn't that right people are going to do what they desire fire you're saved you are sealed and saved for all of eternity you cannot be lost if you're really saved huh because you're not really saved if there's a if huh no you're not really saved maybe you might be but if you're saved period he believed that i could you know that i'm saying for time that man i would go paint the town red i would go have me a time i see it shows what he really wanted and it wasn't right his desires change because that's what it's all about if you don't love god from your heart if that desire isn't down there then do it in vain anyway there's millions out there doing it in vain i wanted to establish i won't go into it but i want to establish you the fact that jesus said one place he says when i come back to earth will i even find anybody that has faith that loves me that wants to serve me that wants to accept me that wants me i mean they don't want him but how many knows we want him it's about your desire about what you want praise be to god and then that brought me to another thought was that uh uh you know the prophet god he says you know boy they'd go drinking and and everything else and somebody asked the question i believe it was brother can a person drink or can a person do this you know if they're christian you know and you know he says when you're saved you can do whatever you want he says you know if you'll just get first saved then do what you want first get saved you'll do the right thing you'll want the right thing yeah amen even he brought it to god said he says you know i've drank all the beer i want in the last you know i've gotten to drink it all i smoked all i want i smoked all the pot i want [Music] i did all the crack i want today and it's zero right why because of desire they want to they didn't want it [Music] i believe the uh johns brothers had a song they don't want him then they didn't want him now they didn't want him then they don't want it because they got the wrong desire the wrong passion amen oh my you know i believe another place he says you know i've been getting drunk for the last as long as he's been saved ever since i've gotten the holy ghost i've been getting drunk yeah drunk on what the spirit it just makes me feel real good come on folks it really does you think i act funny oh my when the day of pentecost happened and they come up out of the room it said they staggered like a bunch of drunk men they got so full of the holy ghost they staying in the rounds like them huh how many believe we could have some more though goes we should want more of the holy how many brother bran's revivals all those early 1900s you know the preacher wouldn't even come out yet and people be healed everybody got healed because they come expect me people stay all night why they got choked from the holy ghost they forgot it was nine o'clock they forgot it was 10 o'clock they forgot it was 11 o'clock now they just got such a happy time they got so full of the spirit they got drunk in the spirit i've heard them at church where folks you got me ahead in the end of the service the young folks and everyone was out there climbing trees i heard now the lord was just praising god and the lord was just i mean he was just rejoicing in their praise and angels all everywhere huh but anyway so the question is what do you want what do you want a little bit let's go back and look at something how many knows that jesus it's a pearl of great price he's like a diamond probably god said this in in his message he talked about called jesus like a diamond all right jesus is like a diamond now you just take a diamond out of the mines and it doesn't look very much i think brother brad preached a days ago but about a diamond it has to be cut right it has to be cut a certain way you gotta have something very sharp to cut it it got to be cut just right and why the little it'll reflect the glory of what's on the inside of it when light strikes it it makes all kinds of beautiful colors it's supposed to impress the ladies huh that's why we get our wife a wedding ring a diamond ring right oh wow it's expensive it's beautiful yeah and it's beautiful why but it's cut and it reflects something and you know even though listen jesus was taken out of the earth so to speak and he was cut on isn't that right he was bruised he was wounded cut cut deep but what did he bring out a beautiful reflection he was wounded he was killed for what my transgressions oh my that horrible bloody cuts that put upon him the stripes he put on his back amen and the bruise of the side of the spear that went in his side and cut him open brought forth a beautiful thing called the forgiveness of your sins it you know brother sean listen it made look at all the people that made smile and why i'm happy because my sins are gone they're underneath the blood on the cross of calvary made beautiful songs from it oh my he was bruised for our iniquities what is iniquity stuff that you know that you shouldn't do and you still do it how many would not be here anymore if it wasn't grace in the times of times when you knew you shouldn't you still did huh nobody would be here if it wasn't for his grace for your iniquities huh that's right so it's another beautiful chisel another beautiful chop another beauty something that looks so hard but yet it was so beautiful it's a gym it's the most treasured thing that we have isn't it it's like that diamond because of his wound because of his bruising for our iniquity amen the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes hallelujah when they put those lights on his back it was for healing you never overcome cold but when the first sickness comes along you'd be dead amen and his stripes were for our healing aren't you glad for that amen i'm so glad and yet people don't want it they just don't want the greatest treasure there is why is it one reason i said of course sunday is because their own the works are dark evil this is the condemnation because men love darkness rather than life they know there's a price that comes with it they know it'll do something for you it'll change you oh my how many wives try to change their husband how many husbands try to change their wives does it work we got quite a few honest folks here tonight no no it don't work oh my me and my wife was having just a little counseling and i i you know you know at the truck and he says honey i'll try to do better on that you know it's a simple thing like maybe not fellowship as much as what i've said and i'd like for you to talk to me more okay honey i'll try to make sure i do that you know but will i do it most likely not unless i just get closer to the lord because then you'll want to please the lord and you want to please your wife but let me know there's only one changing power i mean there's only one thing that changes there's only one thing that would change these people and that is the power of the holy ghost see in order to have a different desire you have to have a different spirit how many knows when you get a serial killer spirit it's a spirit that's on them they'll do it again and again they have to get rid of that spirit any kind of spirit i don't care so that it'll change what you want because jesus confirmed this message tonight when he said that wherever your treasure is that's where your heart is going to be that's where you want to be that's what you'll want to do what you thirst for what you long for what you love to do [Music] what did brother bam say you gotta call yourself a christian go to a man's garage he said with all kinds of pictures and stuff that ought to be up there right well he's just ruined his testimony and they're right because his actions can speak louder than his words but you get the holy ghost you rip them things right down right what you eat on what you feed on every day oh my now let's get to our message and i'll give you my title is that okay this is i saw that bread of life amen your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that if any man eat thereof and die not i am the living bread praise be to the lord i miss glad for that which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i give him is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore strove amongst themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them barely barely i say unto you step you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drink with my blood and my blood is drink indeed now understand he was saying something to them that they did not understand what do you do when you come across the word of god where you just don't understand it do you say well that that ain't right if you say that ain't right the word of god is true you just let it rest well maybe god will show me one day i don't understand it but unfortunately too many people just think it ain't right that's why they explain the way predestination and foreknowledge and all those things because it's it it is it has a way of trying to not want to fit into here but no that's not how it works he made the choice long before you ever thought of making a choice before the foundation of the world amen because he saw what was in you he knew what you would do oh my this is fixing to get good all right my flesh is meat and deed and my blood is drink indeed he that eats my flesh and drinketh my blood dwell often me and i in him as the living father has sent me and i live by the father so he to he that eateth me even he shall live by me let me ask you something what does the holy ghost feed on only one thing that's the word of god the holy ghost cares only about this word that's what it feeds on and let me tell you something this is jesus in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh this is jesus when you feed on this you're feeding on him now unfortunately this is the whole thought tonight is people don't like to feed on this they like to feed on some man made doctrine jesus says you teach for doctrines to what the commandments of men and they liked it came to accepting the word they couldn't do it let me go further here and this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat man and are dead he that this bread shall live for ever now remember he said i am the living bread that's what our subject is the living bread he is the living bread a believer has a taste he wants more of the living bread i don't know if i ever do you can you can judge but do you ever hear me give some of my own ideas up here my own thoughts times when you have to say well i think that's just brother byler's idea you know you might because i'm human most of the time if i do that i try to say look this is my idea like paul said this is not me but the spirit but i guarantee you if i do that you no doubt will pick that up and say well i'm not so sure about that all right well you don't have to be honest with you i do that with preachers folk i'm back there brother brad and i'm listening about preachers behind my pope but now i want to try to make sure they're giving the right stuff out so yeah i'm always is that right or not is that right is that right you know you know and sometimes i'm like we'll just take it that was a take that with a grain of salt that might have been a bone we'll spit that out i like the rest of it you know i'm gonna throw the preacher out but sometimes i don't quite understand and then i just leave that alone but a believer loves the word of god and you know when you're reading the word you are absolutely reading it 100 right amen all right now let's go on many therefore his disciples this is in verse 60. when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciples disciples murmured about it he said unto them does this offend you why don't you shall see the son of man and send up from where he was before and that really really stumbled some of the pharisees because they said what he means to stand up from where he was before we know mary and we know joseph we know where he come from he didn't come from above you know and he's saying he came from above it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of little or nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who who would be who they were who believed not and who should betray dream and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father we could stay all night on that one blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they should be filled who do you think put that hunger in there who do you think put that i want that in there amen because you could just as easy as have i don't want no no part of that holy holy fanaticism and all the other stuff that people call it okay except that we're giving them to him of my father from that time maybe for 70 there was a big old group that all walked away there was another time whenever i think it was before this i should we go back but listen it may have been just before this but one place he says you know why have you come out here you didn't come out here to hear the word but you came out here and you are here for one reason and it's not for the spiritual food but it is for the loaves and the fishes some people were just following jesus for the blessings of the benefits of the blessing but following jesus is much more than that amen so many of them walk back no more with him amen and then said jesus unto the twelve will you also go will you all also go then simon peter answered him now notice the disciples were kind of many therefore of his disciples wait a minute verse 61 and when jesus knew that in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them now then said jesus is unto them will you also go simon peter's answer and says lo lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life and we believe that and are sure i like that and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god he said the right thing he believed the right thing he had been given something how many know of the father to believe with that desire that want folks if you didn't want to come to church tonight you wouldn't be here people don't want to go to church that's why they're not here people don't want to praise the lord so they know people don't want to serve god so they know people want to live haphazard so they do they want to think their own thoughts go their own way dude go ahead it's only the grace of god that gives you the desire to want to feel follow him all the way amen because jesus wasn't he wanted if you want to follow him i'll go with him through the garden and then take up your course and follow him hate your very own life i don't want anything else but christ paul for paul for me to live is christ today's game it was everything to him amen oh my let's talk about that one aren't you thankful for that one quote but abandonment may i stop here just a minute and i realize i'm facing clergymen and smart men that i ran many times with the eighth grade education would be preached to many phds lld's doctors of divinity and everybody he preached to him he wasn't afraid because he knew that was truth and that jesus would come and back him up he had nothing to be afraid of but i'd just like to say this i believe this and know it that jesus never went to the cross and died for some haphazard affair of perhaps maybe somebody might feel sorry because he died so they'll come and get saved huh so now here down to this listen god doesn't want any business like that no god runs his business by for knowledge knowing before the world was ever formed who [Music] who wouldn't want to another place brother bam says you know he never came for those who didn't want him because if it had all been that way he'd probably never come because he knew none of them won him anyway he wouldn't run his business and do something vain huh but he came because he knew there would be people that would want him that would desire him just like david my soul first for thee god for the living god as the heart pantheth for the water brook oh when you want more of god and you're willing to stay up till nine ten o'clock you're willing to meditate on him whenever you work and wherever you are to think about him first after him your life will change your atmosphere will change your desires and your appetites there you go that's a good word appetite how many knows jesus says which is not their appetite show me your appetite what you love the feast on i'll show you who you are hmm you like to slop all in the slop of the world and eat all the filth up for the world you're a pig that's what pigs do they eat slop amen you come to church and walk hallelujah preach it brother that's so good and then go out there and eat a bunch of dead cow land on some dedication and eat on it you're a crow you're you know they can eat on wheat or they can eat on a carrion huh show me your desire what you want i'll show you who you are better take a good look at ourselves you know as i get older brother glenn i'm getting a little older you too i get to thinking about one thing just had a new thought the other day just kind of come to me i begin i love to think on nothing but the word and and the lord try to do that as much in my business and whatever i do thinking you know i like to meditate about being with the saints over there huh i like to think hey you know what's it going to be like to see all the saints maybe meditate and kind of think about that every day so that whenever you come down to the door of death you'll say well i guess i'm just going where i've been wanting to go for a whole long time you know getting ready for that hour expectation i want to see him i want to see the lord saint john first john ii john summoner three says you know that we shall see him as he is and everyone that has this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure we are under expectation to see him one of these days to see our loved ones one of these days amen it's what we want aren't you glad so he came for those who knew who would desire to have it amen oh yeah you have a desire for it yes you make a choice for it it's just that he puts it in for you to do it with aren't you thankful i really don't know what i would do if i had wings when i think about the grace of god if you know that you're a believer you know your god has done something for you that you're a christian that your life has changed your appetites have changed your desires have changed that that is the grace of god it ought to make you the happiest person in the world because that's a great almighty god that's something that you just can't give yourself god has to give that to you i'm going to take a couple examples if i could yet one of them was simon can i read the story let's go let's go to another story of people some people who wanted him and people who did not want him luke 7. that's actually just a page over from where we're at if i'm on the right place you know it would help if i go to luke and not john excuse me all right now let's hope i got it right 7 and 36. nope that's that's not what i was looking for but i do have this scripture wrote down 7 36 wait it would help me if i go to seven and not eight all right still on the eighth chapter now if i have it wrong here we'll just close church for tonight i'll go take some medicine or something 7 36 and one of the fairest he's desired him that he would eat with him and went in unto the pharisees and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to me and behold a woman in the city which was his sinner and when she knew that jesus sat at meat with the fair and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with the with her with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment amen remember this was very expensive stuff that she got right because as we understand through the prophet that they had a certain and then have they'd have a foot wash wonky to wash his feet you know and anoint him and and so forth and kiss him make him welcome and all these things you know and he sat in that room and just sat there i believe it was simon the pharisees if i'm not wrong how did he invited him to come and then just left him sitting there can you imagine the disrespect do you think he really wanted him there i don't think so i think he wanted to make fun of him but listen anointed them with the ointment and when the pharisee's pharisee which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who in what manner of woman this is that touches him for she's a sinner oh my can i stop there for a minute listen to me how did this get in the scriptures how did it get in the scriptures well luke wrote it so perhaps because i don't know that jesus ever told that pharisee hey i already know what you're thinking right but jesus knew what he was thinking no doubt but jesus rehearsed perhaps this to his disciples say i already knew what he was thinking right and jesus answered said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto dumb by meaning he kept his mouth shut didn't say anything but this is one of those times where i opened his mouth but said i've got something to say to you son i mean those there's coming a day when he's gonna have something to say to a lot of people oh yeah a lot to say to a lot of people about how they treated him while he was here on earth and what he did in his end time amen and he said master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence in the other 50. when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love them the most simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave the most and he said unto them thou hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon see is that this woman i entered into thy house and that gave us me no water for my feet you unwelcomed me now didn't make him welcome but she has washed my feet not with water but with tears i mean she wanted him she desired forgiveness she no doubt believed that he was the messiah that he was the savior that he was the son of god not believe brother bennett but that whenever simon sent his little servant to go call jesus and to invite him that little servant boy was just interested in hey my master wants you to come to eat that boy should have ran up to his feet fell down shipped him out that's forgiveness for his sins amen even as brother branham i believe in i'm thinking it was perhaps in canada when he was preaching he told them that way too starchy they're way too stiff they're way too formal and he had an altar call and so forth and he says barely anybody would come and he'd hurt jesus christ even after the german went forth telling them who they were what their names was and everything like that then people still wouldn't repent when jesus was right there wouldn't you like to have the desert wouldn't you like to have the chance to run to the altar and say god forgive me in my sins save me lord jesus help me to serve you with all of my heart sure we all would have how many is with me we didn't love that chance but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and thou gave me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in has not ceased to kiss my feet he talked about the worship amen she wanted him she wanted grace she needed help bad how many believes for those who want jesus said to us ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you he gave us all these things that people don't want it amen i think one of the things that god's going to say at judgment he's going to prove to him that now you didn't really want it that's right you want it your way you want to have your fun you want to live in sin you love that more than you love me you want that more than you wanted me amen but that's i hope that sticks people want other things more than they want christ that's the bottom line i want more of jesus more and more and more i want more of jesus than i ever had before i want more of jesus amen so i'll give him more of me my head with oil doubt it's not annoying but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto her her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much amen and to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven amen and then that's how that meet with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said unto the woman when thy faith has saved thee go in peace how many looks forward to shaking her hand i'll look forward making her hat that's right your faith has saved thee see people want to be saved somebody wants to be saved how many wants to be delivered how many wants freedom how many wants peace i want it lord though just like the disciples they were willing to forsake all to follow him they wanted it god knew that people would want to that's what he came for the invitation was to everybody that he wouldn't just come with a haphazard idea and maybe it would maybe wouldn't he don't want it that way amen one more story we'll just say it the other one was the thief on the cross amen the thief on the cross one in particular because there was two of them one of them didn't really care he berated him yeah yeah you must have done something over this side or the other but the other one said you know we haven't done anything i can about see him i think if i'm not wrong the one thief corrected the other he says why you do that way he says me and you we deserve what we got but he hadn't done nothing be quiet over there right shut your mouth over there he didn't do anything to deserve this we got coming what we did he said lord when you come into your kingdom will you remember me jesus loved it he says this guy wants it he's honest he's fixing to die but he wants it and because he did that because he wanted it jesus says today you'll be with me in paradise because he wanted it i don't know about you but i want paradise don't you i want heaven i want the rapture i want everything god has and i want more of it how many wants more of it let's give him more of ourself more of your time more of your mind don't don't don't not have any room for him remember to lay out the sins they didn't have any room for him they didn't want him where was he behold i stand outside the door and knocking they were too busy with their own ideas their own ways they have room for it i don't want my own ways i don't want my own idea you because i i have decided to follow jesus amen how many with me i have decided to divided to follow jesus no turning back no turning back heavenly father we come
