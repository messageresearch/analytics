[11:07] all right
[11:10] [Music]
[11:17] here the Lord is
[11:20] clean and during
[11:22] forever the judgments upright and I
[11:25] shall be in innocent from the great
[11:27] transgression
[11:28] let the words of my mouth of my heart
[11:31] accept me O Lord my strength and my
[11:34] redeemer God bless you may be seated
[11:35] brother Brian
[11:40] all right currently and if I'm going to
[11:43] be
[11:45] Ecclesiastes deception after I've tried
[11:48] to just going over some of us by now the
[11:51] courage principle around is fifteen
[11:54] thousand and six hundred dollars and it
[11:57] it's probably a little less than that
[11:59] but I'm asking based on the value
[12:02] and last year alone I've got to like you
[12:05] all do from your we have we paid 79 79
[12:08] 800.
[12:10] nineteen dollars worth principal off the
[12:13] church loan last year and uh right now
[12:17] and we only paid like thirty one hundred
[12:20] dollars worth of Interest last year
[12:23] um also going we're in this new year I
[12:26] was telling brother Steve
[12:29] uh we have about about 200
[12:32] left on the prepay for the propane
[12:36] and we're probably down to about 35 so
[12:39] I'm gonna have to have them
[12:41] I'll have them refill and that'll be the
[12:43] last time for the for the year until
[12:46] next winter
[12:47] uh like I've told you before all the
[12:49] bills are paid off
[12:52] uh I've been a little bit late on
[12:55] getting I have to turn the paperwork in
[12:57] for
[12:59] see how much they're going to reimburse
[13:10] there's a thousand dollars
[13:12] I figured it out everything that was
[13:15] bought were just shy and having the trim
[13:18] redone right about in this week but
[13:20] going
[13:21] changing my side here
[13:25] you know brother Thomas food
[13:27] was preaching out of Romans 8 last week
[13:30] and what what he God is asking us to do
[13:34] in the age that we live in is to unpack
[13:37] to unpack the things that we've been
[13:39] carrying around our whole life and uh I
[13:42] was just thanking me
[13:44] I don't know if all you know that but
[13:47] we're
[13:49] 40 years 30 years you don't realize how
[13:52] much you accumulate when you go from
[13:55] bigger to smaller how much
[13:58] that God doesn't want
[14:02] holding on to things that we really
[14:04] shouldn't be holding on I really don't
[14:06] use the house as an example
[14:09] because that's a big thing but really
[14:12] you know it's the things you carry on
[14:15] you every day you know the your thoughts
[14:18] your ideas the grudges or the things
[14:21] you've left undone in your life those
[14:23] are the kind of things that you've got
[14:26] to unpack you don't want to be holding
[14:28] on to those as we go you know in a into
[14:32] this New Year well it ain't even a new
[14:35] year anymore but I'll go to a
[14:37] Ecclesiastes seven
[14:39] here and
[14:44] I'll give you all a chance to get there
[14:45] I know I'm quick on the
[14:49] and it says a good name is better than
[14:51] precious ointment and the day of death
[14:54] than the day one's birth and that's a
[14:56] principle
[14:58] brother Brown talked about it
[15:00] it's a really important principle you
[15:03] realize that your life is short
[15:05] and the only only thing you're going to
[15:07] carry by calling the grade with me and
[15:09] go to the other side with me there's a
[15:12] lot of things we carry around with us
[15:13] that aren't going to be there on that
[15:15] truth
[15:16] that you possess the character that
[15:19] you've developed that God's developed in
[15:21] you that's the only thing going on the
[15:23] other side everything else you're going
[15:25] to lead you're gonna know who you are I
[15:27] know who I am
[15:28] um just review these verses I already
[15:31] read the first one it is better to go to
[15:34] the house among and then to go to the
[15:36] house of feasting foreign
[15:40] or the man that knows he's got a short
[15:43] time will know that you have no continue
[15:45] we just need to let him go and it says
[15:48] sorrow is better than laughter for by
[15:51] sadness of the continents The Heart Is
[15:53] Made better
[15:54] you know it's a wonderful thing but it's
[15:57] in the valleys and he struggles and your
[15:59] heartaches that you become a better man
[16:02] or a better woman the heart of the lies
[16:05] is in the heart of mourning but the
[16:06] heart of fools is in the house of Murphy
[16:08] it is better to hear the rebuke of the
[16:10] wives than for a man to hear the song of
[16:12] fools you know that's the thing you got
[16:14] to be careful of now everyone wants to
[16:16] hear people say nice things about them
[16:18] good things about them
[16:20] but it's better to have a friend that
[16:22] tells you the truth sometimes than it
[16:24] always tells you something that isn't
[16:25] the truth and it goes on for us the
[16:28] Practical and early oppression making
[16:30] the wise man mad and it and a gift
[16:32] destroys the heart better is the end of
[16:34] a thing than in the beginning thereof
[16:37] and the patient is in spirit is better
[16:39] than the proud and spirit
[16:41] be Hasty in thy Spirit to be excuse me
[16:45] I'm not reading be here say say nothing
[16:48] what is the course of the four days were
[16:51] better than these for thou excellently
[16:54] of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life
[16:56] to them
[16:58] that spirit that brother Branham talked
[17:00] about they're talking it was the minute
[17:02] they
[17:04] manifested
[17:06] in three attributes but you don't
[17:08] believe in eternity it's like they're so
[17:10] I've got little feeling that you break
[17:12] something would call me a character you
[17:14] know they're just struck by that but I
[17:16] just it's the spirit of the age that
[17:19] when you either conform
[17:21] and also I was thinking and women
[17:24] actually doing the right thing people
[17:27] are being elected by 30. I'm not gonna I
[17:30] know I say I'm not gonna read a whole
[17:31] chapter I wanted to reading and he's the
[17:34] man's fake my pronunciations of these
[17:35] names is not good Ethel surely I'm more
[17:38] Brutus than amen and have not the
[17:40] understanding of a man
[17:51] and this is what I was thinking it's
[17:53] starting at the fifth or
[17:55] Texas chapter
[17:56] and when he when they mentioned that
[17:58] Shield is hard for us to believe but in
[18:00] their day
[18:02] if you were a footman or an infantry
[18:05] Soldier and you didn't have a good
[18:07] shield and you were in trouble like I
[18:09] remove fall from me vanity lies and that
[18:12] vanity there's things are going good in
[18:15] your life that you don't think anything
[18:16] can go wrong that's van control and well
[18:18] you can be on the hill
[18:21] so well so that's what he's talking
[18:24] about here take the name of God in vain
[18:26] and he's thinks that go and he says a
[18:29] huge night of servant onto his goes on
[18:31] there is a generation oh how lofty are
[18:34] their eyes and their eyelids
[18:36] from off the earth and the needy from
[18:38] among men and I was just thinking that's
[18:40] where it happens myself I know I say
[18:42] that a lot but we speak for myself I see
[18:46] my faults I see my weaknesses I see my
[18:49] strengths oh he sees who you are you
[18:52] know when you get nothing they can do
[18:54] against you it's ever going to change
[18:56] your mind if you're dealing like that
[18:58] with your heavenly father you know
[19:00] sometimes we just take things on
[19:02] Facebook but that's not how a Christian
[19:03] should be a Christian should prove
[19:06] everything they hear doesn't mean that
[19:08] you disrespect the spirit of what's
[19:09] being said you know you just got on that
[19:12] you've been carrying all these years
[19:13] even myself
[19:15] it won't matter all that good

[36:19] amen as you know brother Parish passed
[36:22] away early Friday morning went to be
[36:24] with the Lord
[36:25] in his new body going and shaking
[36:27] people's hands everywhere this morning
[36:29] no doubt
[36:30] amen I'll tell you what I was just
[36:32] thinking of if God whatever is wouldn't
[36:34] it
[36:35] amen if we could just ever set
[36:38] transition of that angel being there
[36:39] that other body be in there and going
[36:41] into that new body and so forth amen but
[36:44] we know it's true amen it's just hard
[36:47] for us to conceive it amen but we know
[36:50] that there's a land beyond the river
[36:51] that we call a sweet forever amen and so
[36:54] we certainly miss him and on note at
[36:57] sister Parish
[36:58] uh most of all
[37:01] um this morning our hearts go out to her
[37:03] in a special way since that was her mate
[37:05] amen we know that that's a that's a
[37:07] special kind of pain for somebody to
[37:09] have to suffer amen and so I've heard
[37:12] many things about it and hope
[37:15] well I shouldn't say but hope that I'm
[37:18] I'm the one to go first I'll have to
[37:20] experience it but anyway it's just
[37:23] terrible amen from what I understand he
[37:24] lost his life it was a whole different
[37:26] story
[37:27] you know you don't know what it's really
[37:28] like until you go through it amen so our
[37:30] heart goes out the sister parishes but
[37:33] um we prayed everybody pray amen and if
[37:36] it had been the will of the Lord I
[37:37] believe you to raise him up don't you I
[37:39] really do and so we take it as a will of
[37:41] the Lord for him to have a brand new
[37:43] body this morning but we don't want to
[37:45] have a moment of silence for our brother
[37:47] amen and to remember him amen this
[37:49] morning so let's just buy our hits this
[37:51] morning
[38:02] amen and amen I know Sister parish is
[38:05] watching this morning I don't know how
[38:07] uh and you can be seated for a minute I
[38:10] don't know how well it'll transmit we
[38:13] are certainly looking forward to getting
[38:14] uh the uh fiber Amen to coming through
[38:18] here amen so that we can have really
[38:21] good reception because it is very nice
[38:23] to be able to tune in amen
[38:27] um you know and and to be able to watch
[38:29] uh but I just want to say on her behalf
[38:32] if she's listening amen this morning
[38:35] here amen I learned something from
[38:38] Sister Parish during the time amen
[38:40] having spent quite a few hours up there
[38:42] watching her and so forth the way that
[38:44] she cared about him
[38:46] all the little
[38:48] things she does for him and and
[38:52] I'd appreciate our mate more amen

[39:01] ought to be precious to his bad husband
[39:02] and her wife amen and I believe we ought
[39:05] to cherish one another don't you I mean
[39:07] I believe in Ephesians there where we
[39:09] might be reading this morning it says
[39:11] they've got to cherish our wife amen
[39:13] everybody loves him and cherishes it and
[39:16] that's what we ought to do amen I do
[39:18] want to I want to do something that I
[39:19] hadn't done before amen and that is to
[39:22] our election again and everything will
[39:25] remain as it is imprint everybody is
[39:28] happy I certainly believe the Holy
[39:30] Spirit these School teachers and
[39:32] musicians if you would come up at this
[39:34] time and come up front if you know and
[39:37] uh our Sunday school teachers amen

[40:24] one of y'all let me tell y'all I love
[40:26] each and every one of y'all
[40:28] um
[40:29] thank you
[40:31] I don't think there was any
[40:32] announcements or anything else this
[40:35] morning certainly a solemn assembly Lord
[40:37] Jesus where we come together it's
[40:39] sincerity father it is our God that
[40:41] you'll speak to our hearts Lord and that
[40:43] you will have the preeminence in the
[40:45] service keep us into the image God that
[40:46] we're supposed to Lord come and move in
[40:48] the congregation and may we not leave
[40:50] here the same as late upon my heart to
[40:53] speak father and have your way in every
[40:55] portion of it helped me not to get
[40:57] myself in the way or to be carnal in any
[41:00] manner Lord but just to be led by this
[41:02] father
[41:04] we asked these blessings and favors in
[41:07] the name of Jesus Christ
[41:09] amen
[41:11] it's what I have said
[41:13] one time today to speak on it once again
[41:17] amen and I don't know if you've seen it
[41:20] amen on the net we already posted it
[41:22] most of the time we don't get it posted
[41:24] until you're on your way so you probably
[41:25] don't see it but I mean I want to speak
[41:27] on perfect submission amen perfect
[41:30] submission that the prophet of God
[41:32] talked about amen
[41:34] because how many knows there
[41:36] is power in the word of God there's
[41:39] power in God that reads just haven't
[41:42] achieved yet
[41:43] good
[41:45] picture that came to me
[41:46] with all of this in other words you want
[41:49] more of it amen amen no matter how long
[41:51] you've been a Christian to God Amen but
[41:53] it steps on our toes also a little bit
[41:55] and we need that
[41:56] amen
[41:58] ity
[42:03] I know brother Jeremy Lord touched on
[42:05] this here when he was speaking on that
[42:07] Sunday night amen but we want to go down
[42:12] for the husband is the head of the wife
[42:14] even this Christ is the head of the
[42:16] church and is the savior of the body let
[42:19] the wives be to their own husbands in
[42:22] everything amen may God add His
[42:25] blessings you can be seated this morning
[42:29] amen
[42:33] so we it's like a Jose that it's just a
[42:36] little different
[42:37] than our natural relationship means us
[42:43] as headless and him as husband is the
[42:46] Arctic wife because you know a a perfect
[42:49] cousin a lot of times he becomes hard
[42:52] amen
[42:53] but you know the Bible
[42:57] we're going to touch on that everything
[42:58] this morning
[43:00] amen because that everything remember
[43:02] I'm not so much think it says but we're
[43:04] talking about Christ in the church isn't
[43:06] that right that's really where we're
[43:08] going with this is Christ in the church
[43:13] that we're submit to Christ in
[43:15] everything and I want to say this that
[43:17] it is a big battle it is a great
[43:21] every aspect
[43:24] amen now I want to give you if you got
[43:27] an ink pen this is had to listen to
[43:30] about three times
[43:31] and it's uh let me see the the unfailing
[43:35] realities of the Living God
[43:39] 1960
[43:41] 0626. if you want to listen to a message
[43:43] and brother Brandon gets
[43:49] standing is that right
[43:52] and because of that made strong
[43:54] statements and comments about it College
[43:56] I guess it is and and then from what I
[43:59] understand it is uh I haven't got it
[44:01] wrote down here
[44:03] um
[44:04] a descendant
[44:06] I don't know John Wesley one of
[44:08] descended a descendants
[44:11] forth and and more people coming from
[44:14] National Lord or our worldwide Revival
[44:17] again it's gone it's never gonna be what
[44:19] is it I don't know I don't know just
[44:21] what it is
[44:22] ah
[44:24] so I certainly won't make him judgment
[44:26] all of those
[44:28] and I want to read you what he said
[44:30] about him is that okay
[44:31] in perfect strength and perfect weakness
[44:34] he says it this way he says
[44:37] um
[44:39] from our own ability
[44:42] amen
[44:43] our own ability our own ways our own way
[44:46] of thinking and I want to get to it here
[44:48] in a minute we're going to look at what
[44:49] Jesus said about getting away from
[44:51] yourself and how strong Jesus made it
[44:54] and so forth but we'll get into that in
[44:55] a minute nobility I don't care whose it
[44:57] is will ever be usable in the seat
[44:59] you're doing a pretty good job but amen
[45:01] you're never going to be able to be use
[45:03] of God he says how many believe that's
[45:05] the way it is with us Christians and not
[45:07] even it's a fight that we fight every
[45:09] day it's a death we have to die every
[45:11] day
[45:13] foreign
[45:26] now a little bit later he says brother
[45:29] Ann says now forgive me if I get a
[45:31] little ridicul here but I've got to nail
[45:33] this down
[45:35] now notice so he says now it's worse
[45:37] than it was in the beginning it's worse
[45:39] off today than it ever was because that
[45:40] we have tried to do it within human
[45:43] ability
[45:45] they gathered together they gathered and
[45:48] they make long prayers they go out here
[45:50] amen the other day they had a hundred
[45:53] and fifty thousand now let me tell you
[45:54] that's much bigger than the crowds up
[45:56] there 150
[45:58] 000 people that would gather around
[46:02] or something like that gathered to grab
[46:04] both promises
[46:06] make some prayers and so forth he's
[46:09] this that might just as well not have
[46:12] gathered
[46:19] huh
[46:20] they might as well not even have
[46:22] gathered
[46:26] oh mom when you think about it now
[46:29] notice who this is
[46:31] this is God's right-hand man talking
[46:35] this is who God comes down after he
[46:37] preaches like that and backs It Up by
[46:39] zurning thoughts and intents of the
[46:41] heart
[46:42] he was yielded surrendered to God
[46:47] and he knew the truth of the matter
[46:49] didn't he
[46:50] he knew how people really are that whole
[46:54] world is religious
[46:55] huh
[46:57] if you have a Catholic gather and if the
[46:59] pope comes to United States it'll be a
[47:01] hundred and fifty thousand it'll be two
[47:02] hundred feet thousand oh boy that just
[47:04] seemed like Auburn it doesn't mean a
[47:06] thing except
[47:07] maybe they're following the Antichrist
[47:11] so you got to be careful
[47:14] he was talking about them Gathering like
[47:16] that he was talking about
[47:19] one it's not worth nothing instead of
[47:23] God
[47:24] now forgive me if I get critical you can
[47:26] drive the thing down to make it then
[47:27] they'll stick
[47:28] did it do he said nothing
[47:31] it'll never do anything until every
[47:34] person that professes to be a Christian
[47:37] or forget their own ability and heal
[47:40] himself
[47:42] that's why the world is full of today
[47:45] people that just want to go so far
[47:49] amen
[47:51] pretty strong but that's what he said
[47:57] stand God
[48:01] not that first is a killing
[48:06] amen a killing
[48:08] so we can mine you have to die before
[48:11] you can be born again he needs a killing
[48:13] of ourselves this Tabernacle needs a
[48:15] killing and me with it
[48:18] I'm gonna say that this morning this
[48:20] Tabernacle needs a dying and I need to
[48:23] be the one done first
[48:26] to yourself
[48:31] because how many knows that is a
[48:33] scoundrel
[48:36] that is the person it isn't your life it
[48:38] ain't your husband it ain't your enemy
[48:40] it ain't some other person that you
[48:42] fighting to have that gives you the most
[48:44] problems it is yourself that gives you
[48:47] the most problems that's who your
[48:49] greatest enemy is
[48:59] but I can't even make it to church
[49:05] I don't live too far from church but I
[49:08] can't make it on Wednesday night
[49:10] I'm hot
[49:12] I can't rendered to God wants to do the
[49:14] will I got more
[49:16] than anything in the world Jesus Christ
[49:18] was so surrendered to the Holy Spirit to
[49:20] the father until he did not but what his
[49:22] father showed them first and it did
[49:25] nothing but what his father's will was
[49:27] and his will is his word if you want to
[49:29] know what the will of God is read God's
[49:31] Bible
[49:33] it's obvious what the word God is
[49:36] but we want our way
[49:38] we want to do what we want to do
[49:41] but they still want to do what they want
[49:43] to do
[49:46] hey it is today that's exactly the same
[49:49] they want it
[49:51] it wanted to receive it on the level
[49:53] that God brings it
[49:55] that's the only way God has a brain in
[49:57] it and we cannot bring God down to our
[50:00] level of thinking we've got to rise
[50:02] ourselves up to his level of thinking
[50:04] and meet him on the grounds that he has
[50:07] provided for us to meet him on
[50:09] but
[50:13] folks how many who knows that's the way
[50:16] there's a lot of time people
[50:18] need this they want to live just the way
[50:20] they want to live they could be right on
[50:22] living the way that they've always lived
[50:28] yeah be very religious and go to a
[50:31] church and to be a member thereof
[50:33] oh man they're making all Sunday morning
[50:35] or whatever time it is and have about 15
[50:37] minutes sermon from the pastor and we'll
[50:40] walk no then they'll walk away from
[50:42] there some kind of
[50:45] all right
[50:48] you got a Surrender Your term you got
[50:51] this surrender
[50:52] well
[50:56] our completely surrender
[51:00] surrender
[51:06] when we get in trouble
[51:09] we got technical still under their own
[51:12] way when God tell them they assume
[51:14] believe what they believe
[51:17] that's why
[51:18] the world's in the condition that it's
[51:20] in all right if you're not worried I'm
[51:23] not willing to submit ourselves
[51:28] get this
[51:32] how many knows
[51:33] remember both of the moment amen that
[51:36] she was fun to have a problem
[51:39] is you're so nervous so upset is because
[51:42] you cheated on your husband many years
[51:44] ago
[51:45] she says
[51:47] no you did
[51:49] do it against God you did it against
[51:51] God but that is living there I
[51:54] don't care how I'm gonna have to be
[51:55] there
[51:57] laughs if he ain't going nowhere as long
[52:00] as Sin Lays
[52:04] boards and trustee boards he say talk to
[52:07] a preacher and
[52:08] his deacons and says now look we have so
[52:10] much time he says and by that time you
[52:13] better be done
[52:15] he says I love the preacher the
[52:19] I'd love to preach them actually all day
[52:22] I wouldn't quit
[52:23] so to speak
[52:26] yeah I'd let him know
[52:29] big female
[52:32] talking about a church to dominate over
[52:34] God's preacher what he can't he can't do
[52:36] ain't the worst curse in the world
[52:44] why does the wife have to submit to her
[52:46] husband
[52:48] because whenever he's going to wrote
[52:49] down whenever you get two heads in the
[52:51] house there's some head button going on
[52:55] isn't that right
[52:56] I've never got oh boy
[52:58] until someone might fall over and
[53:00] submits all right
[53:03] only supposed to be one hit
[53:07] that's the way it is with the body of
[53:09] Christ
[53:10] how many beliefs we have a head that it
[53:12] is Christ
[53:14] amen
[53:16] my my
[53:19] when I think about it have a husband for
[53:22] a husband looks for a man
[53:25] she likes to get the most perfect one
[53:27] that you can find
[53:28] first of all don't want to be a
[53:30] Christian you know right Godly and so
[53:31] forth somebody can supply for but let me
[53:34] tell you something whenever you get
[53:35] married to Christ
[53:37] I said he shall supply all your needs
[53:41] according to his riches in Christ Jesus
[53:44] my God shall supply all your needs when
[53:47] you get married to Christ he's gonna
[53:48] take care of you from the right
[53:50] went through you ain't got a word you
[53:52] ain't even got to worry about taking
[53:54] your own thoughts
[53:56] huh
[53:58] oh my thinking thoughts because they're
[54:01] gonna be perfect oh my beautiful eyes
[54:04] had a husband that thought the perfect
[54:05] thing every time you say I mean you do
[54:07] to think okay I just enjoy be with you
[54:11] ever see a woman cuddle up to the man
[54:13] just cuddle all up to him
[54:15] why she's relying on him
[54:17] she loves him she submitted to him it's
[54:20] the way it's supposed to be
[54:21] amen
[54:24] oh my
[54:27] God all right can we go on
[54:30] that's right
[54:32] we got to die to ourselves
[54:34] hey man we need a killing what the world
[54:36] needs is a killing what people in the
[54:38] message need is to die in to their self
[54:42] I say if you're never gonna
[54:45] advice
[54:47] you're gonna have to die yourself and to
[54:49] your ways
[54:50] more
[54:52] it can't be your way and his way
[54:56] notice
[54:58] brother bam says in the same message
[55:01] when he comes in his power of his
[55:03] resurrection to make people live and act
[55:05] and to behave themselves to change their
[55:08] attitude to change their ways people
[55:11] don't want to change their ways
[55:14] you're gonna hear that you better do you
[55:16] need to change your ways because that's
[55:18] what God's going to have you to do
[55:20] that's what the resurrection powered us
[55:23] might come to church as you are and
[55:25] stayed as you are that is a lie Straight
[55:27] From the Bottom scraping the barrel of
[55:29] hell
[55:33] come on folks
[55:36] they've always lived and yet be very
[55:38] religious
[55:40] all right that now the holy spirit will
[55:43] not misbehave itself when one person
[55:45] another it'll make each person come into
[55:48] its character because it's a spirit that
[55:50] leads you it makes
[56:02] any Christian wants to try this your
[56:04] body completely submitted to God you
[56:06] will
[56:07] is out folks

[56:14] what we really need are young people you
[56:17] have got to follow
[56:19] Wednesday man this is me something to
[56:21] enjoy to do that you love to do
[56:25] you don't get that you're in trouble
[56:29] he loved to give up the things of the
[56:31] world when the Holy Spirit comes in it
[56:32] cleanses you and it puts your desire
[56:36] how wonderful it is to be Christ and to
[56:40] be smitted
[56:47] is that you
