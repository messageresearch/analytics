[35:45] all
[35:49] the way
[35:55] through his opened
[35:58] door
[36:02] praise god praise god and the church
[36:05] said amen
[36:07] praise the lord
[36:10] let's stand together tonight amen i
[36:14] don't know who i sung that for but the
[36:15] door is open for you
[36:17] so appreciate the lord jesus
[36:21] isn't god good for us he's good for us
[36:24] not just good to us he's good for us you
[36:26] know that
[36:27] amen amen the lord is good for you amen
[36:30] i just um
[36:33] i just appreciate the bible been looking
[36:35] at some things this week that the lord i
[36:37] believe has
[36:38] been speaking to my heart personally on
[36:40] a personal basis just
[36:42] little things you know reading the
[36:43] scripture and i i marvel at
[36:46] how often the scriptures we read
[36:49] the things that we read in the bible
[36:51] that maybe in a way of looking at it
[36:54] we would think well that was speaking to
[36:56] that one and that one and then this one
[36:57] over there and then
[36:59] this kingdom and then that king and this
[37:01] prophet what more but
[37:02] i we could read it like that but i
[37:05] always
[37:05] marvel when i read the word how personal
[37:08] it feels
[37:09] like god's talking right to me right out
[37:11] of his scripture
[37:12] it says wait on the lord and you'll be
[37:14] strengthened and he talks about being
[37:16] overcomers and all the great things
[37:18] my love that i'll give it just feels
[37:19] like he's talking right to me
[37:21] amen that's because the bible is unlike
[37:23] any book in the world
[37:25] it's not like a dictionary or
[37:26] encyclopedia when you pick it up
[37:28] you're going to read certain things and
[37:29] those things were wrote for individuals
[37:32] that were of a specific maybe class or a
[37:35] specific profession but
[37:36] the bible was created and wrote
[37:40] for the saints of god this is why
[37:42] brethren called this god's love letter
[37:44] to you and i
[37:45] i am so glad to have a love letter love
[37:48] letter from the lord jesus christ
[37:50] to know what he thinks about me and how
[37:52] he feels about me amen
[37:54] i love the lord tonight so appreciate
[37:56] his grace let's um
[37:58] if you have your bible tonight turn to
[37:59] matthew chapter 5.
[38:01] i want to speak to you this evening on
[38:03] what are blessings
[38:06] what are blessings
[38:10] amen what are blessings
[38:23] i've been preaching on this for several
[38:25] weeks and i kept saying what is
[38:26] blessings
[38:27] and that little school teacher of mine
[38:28] said you can't say what is it's what are
[38:32] hallelujah matthew 5
[38:36] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[38:37] saying
[38:39] blessed are they let's pray together
[38:43] lord jesus we thank you so much for your
[38:45] word
[38:47] lord as i was just expressing to the
[38:48] people here just
[38:50] just a few seconds ago the meaning
[38:54] and the effect of this great letter lord
[38:56] jesus
[38:58] there are times that i don't feel your
[39:00] presence or times that i don't feel
[39:01] angels around me times i don't feel
[39:03] strengthened from saints
[39:05] there's something comforting about the
[39:07] bible to be able to
[39:09] open it up and to be able to read these
[39:10] words just to be able to hold it close
[39:13] to us and to be able to know that this
[39:14] was the very thoughts of god on paper
[39:17] lord we are so appreciative from being
[39:19] able to write
[39:20] and read from the writings rather of the
[39:23] things that have been
[39:24] lord not only just put on paper but
[39:27] people have given
[39:28] their lives for what we've read tonight
[39:30] we thank you lord for this
[39:32] great bible but yet a strange thing
[39:35] would be said by the apostle paul many
[39:37] years
[39:38] after pentecost had come when he lets us
[39:41] know
[39:42] that the letter kills but the spirit
[39:43] gives life so father tonight we pray
[39:46] that you will come by your anointing
[39:48] that you'll place the anointing of the
[39:49] holy spirit upon this book tonight
[39:52] and that you will edifice by our
[39:54] gathering together
[39:55] may the holy ghost take this word this
[39:57] evening
[39:58] and quicken it to our hearts open our
[40:00] hearts that we may receive
[40:02] open my heart that i may give use me as
[40:04] a vessel now lord and
[40:06] give us the strength that we need lord
[40:07] jesus to understand what you would speak
[40:09] to us tonight by thy word
[40:11] in the name of jesus jesus christ we
[40:14] pray bless every person in divine
[40:15] presence and those
[40:16] that will be streaming online we pray
[40:18] the holy ghost we'll meet them right
[40:19] with their aunt
[40:21] do great things lord healing of the body
[40:22] and moving upon their minds and their
[40:25] thoughts and whatever more they might
[40:26] have need of tonight
[40:27] as we commit this to you lord in the
[40:28] name of jesus christ
[40:30] amen and all the saints said amen you
[40:33] may be seated may the lord bless you
[40:39] what are blessings
[40:43] you know i guess if i took a poll and i
[40:47] sat down with all of you and i maybe had
[40:49] a survey
[40:50] laid out of different questions about
[40:53] what
[40:53] you might think blessings are i imagine
[40:56] every single one of us would probably be
[40:59] in a different mindset about what
[41:02] blessings are
[41:03] some of us would probably say perhaps
[41:05] that you know that the blessings of god
[41:07] are
[41:08] financial maybe somebody would say that
[41:11] the blessings of god are
[41:13] um you know perhaps maybe the way that
[41:16] god would heal bodies
[41:17] or bring peace to marriages or bring
[41:21] peace to children
[41:22] maybe it would be the way that god has
[41:24] blessed a business
[41:25] and all of those things are degrees of
[41:28] blessings it's true
[41:30] that they all have their levels of
[41:32] blessings if you will
[41:34] god does bless us in those manners but
[41:36] the true blessing of god
[41:38] and the blessing that i want to
[41:39] certainly try to emphasize tonight
[41:42] is a whole lot deeper than just the
[41:44] blessing that we get whenever we are
[41:47] maybe offered extra in the paycheck or
[41:49] we've been given a promotion
[41:50] or some kind of new thing has happened
[41:52] and we've been upped in life
[41:55] but the last
[41:58] thing that i want to talk about is on
[42:00] this wise
[42:01] the true blessing of god which is the
[42:03] indwelling of the holy spirit
[42:05] and then from that baptism of the holy
[42:07] ghost we are led
[42:08] into the things of god into the
[42:10] revelation of the holy spirit
[42:11] and that revelation takes us into a deep
[42:14] understanding of who jesus christ
[42:16] is who we are and how we all fit
[42:18] together in this program of god
[42:20] so i want to liken for you tonight and
[42:23] kind of parallel if you will
[42:24] the blessing the word blessing of god or
[42:26] that word blessings
[42:28] with the word repentance and i'd like to
[42:30] use if i could
[42:31] just as an example the message of future
[42:34] home
[42:35] when brother branham explains to us
[42:36] repentance and you have to understand
[42:38] when brother adam goes to approach a
[42:39] repentance this way it's probably the
[42:41] first time
[42:42] that most anybody had ever heard
[42:43] repentance approached this way
[42:45] but he talked about that repentance
[42:47] could come so far
[42:48] that a person used the days of noah when
[42:51] they come to the anne luvion and god
[42:53] saved eight on the ark through the
[42:56] floods
[42:57] and he talked about that being salvation
[43:00] in the form or the type of a christian
[43:02] with the earth
[43:03] paralleling a christian's life he said
[43:05] that the earth was saved
[43:07] in the days of noah even the bible
[43:09] speaks about eight being
[43:11] saved or salvation being applied to
[43:14] those time periods into those days
[43:16] but then notice that he talked about sin
[43:19] coming out on the other side
[43:21] so salvation or repentance as we would
[43:24] look at the type of it
[43:25] the earth as it was come up to the altar
[43:27] give its heart to god
[43:28] got saved and then got baptized but
[43:31] there was
[43:32] nothing prepared inside the earth or
[43:34] nothing
[43:35] made of a fire baptism to turn the earth
[43:38] into its original condition
[43:40] by spoken word which would have been
[43:42] without sin diseased germ
[43:44] there had been no wars that have been
[43:46] none of these type of things
[43:47] had salvation been fully given to the
[43:51] earth in the days of noah
[43:53] we would already be in the paradises of
[43:55] god with the new study setting here
[43:56] and science of god going in and out but
[43:59] now remember the earth
[44:01] got saved but there was only a degree of
[44:04] salvation
[44:05] that took it so far then brother mike is
[44:07] that to an
[44:08] individual that the same exact thing
[44:10] happens for those
[44:11] that will hear acts 2 38 they'll repent
[44:15] they'll repent and they'll come up so
[44:17] far and yet not go
[44:19] all the way into the baptism of the holy
[44:21] ghost by the way
[44:22] judas was such a person that had
[44:24] repented
[44:25] justified which is repentance and then
[44:28] sanctified
[44:29] even by the blood of jesus christ when
[44:31] jesus said
[44:32] by the word of god i mean to say that he
[44:34] said sanctify
[44:36] him by thy word thy word is truth that
[44:38] was judas
[44:39] all the way up through sanctification
[44:41] even repentant to the spot
[44:43] to where that jesus could even share
[44:46] part of his holy ghost given ministry
[44:49] with all 12 disciples judas included so
[44:52] the degree of repentance that he had
[44:54] brought him all the way up to that point
[44:56] to where that he kissed
[44:57] he kisses jesus in the garden of
[44:59] gethsemane and then turns away
[45:01] as we know the rest of the story satan
[45:03] enters into him at the supper
[45:05] and then judas goes to his place so
[45:07] repentance carried him that far
[45:09] but yet he did not receive full
[45:11] repentance you understand that a person
[45:14] whether they're in a message church or
[45:15] out of a message church
[45:17] could hear the message of salvation and
[45:20] just
[45:20] and that's saint john 3 16 god so loved
[45:22] the world he gave
[45:23] and here that they could repent and be
[45:25] saved by jesus christ
[45:27] and actually receive salvation
[45:30] to a degree to a degree that they can
[45:33] even be saved from the world
[45:35] be saved from maybe habits of alcohol or
[45:37] drugs
[45:38] or abuses of some kind uh some kind of
[45:41] misabuse with their body perhaps or
[45:42] homosexual or
[45:44] you know just some kind of a thing out
[45:45] there running around causing havoc all
[45:47] the time
[45:48] and they can hear the gospel preached
[45:50] and actually repent to the point
[45:52] to where that they are saved now listen
[45:55] close
[45:56] but that does not mean if a person is
[45:58] saved
[45:59] that does not mean they are baptized
[46:01] with the holy ghost
[46:03] remember the earth has been saved since
[46:06] the days of noah but the earth don't
[46:07] have the holy ghost yet
[46:09] it will take a period of time in which
[46:12] that the holy spirit
[46:13] will come upon this earth and give it
[46:16] its fiery baptism and then revert it
[46:18] back
[46:19] to the original back to what god
[46:20] intended in the very beginning
[46:22] no diseased germs brother i haven't
[46:24] talked about the holy fire of god will
[46:26] cleanse the atmosphere around us
[46:28] they won't have to wear any mask in
[46:30] heaven because there won't be any
[46:31] respiratory diseases
[46:33] none of that all of the atmosphere will
[46:35] be cleansed
[46:36] 100 completely cleansed out there won't
[46:38] be any disease germs or demonology or
[46:40] nothing for the
[46:41] for demons to work with for all of that
[46:43] will be cleansed
[46:44] at its fire baptism same thing with you
[46:46] when you receive the baptism of the holy
[46:48] ghost
[46:49] all sins of unbelief and all these other
[46:52] things were completely purged
[46:54] out of your soul remember when a person
[46:57] friend
[46:57] is truly born again of the holy spirit
[46:59] any evilness or any
[47:01] meanness or anything contrary to the
[47:03] word as
[47:04] completely taken out of their heart when
[47:07] you see folks
[47:08] that claim to be saved and forever see
[47:10] the holy ghost and they're still
[47:11] struggling and battling
[47:12] with that old temper my wife had a good
[47:14] remark we were speaking about an
[47:16] individual yesterday
[47:18] that has been in church for many many
[47:20] many years and we love this brother and
[47:21] we love we appreciate him but
[47:23] it's just we've known him since we were
[47:24] a little bitty and you know he he
[47:26] claims to be a believer and he claims to
[47:28] be a christian but yet he's got the same
[47:30] attitude the same type nature
[47:32] he's never had any kind of evident
[47:35] change in his life whatsoever and as
[47:37] much as i love
[47:38] this man as much as i would want to help
[47:40] this man i realize that until a person
[47:42] fully gives their heart or the throne
[47:44] room of their heart
[47:46] for jesus to set down upon that throne
[47:48] room
[47:49] i don't care how much they go to church
[47:51] i don't care how much they read the
[47:52] message i don't care how holy they might
[47:54] be
[47:54] they can give a tenth of their living
[47:56] and offering every time they walk
[47:57] through the door
[47:58] and be the best a manner in the service
[48:01] praise the lord
[48:02] any takers on that one tonight amen
[48:05] there could be all of that but yet at
[48:06] the very same time
[48:08] still never move into the real condition
[48:12] of being born again by the holy spirit
[48:15] this is why the prophet of god taught us
[48:17] and this is why the bible taught us
[48:19] that there will be those that can come
[48:20] right up to the border
[48:22] and they can taste of the heavenly gift
[48:25] they can partake
[48:26] of supernatural things and yet never
[48:29] cross fully over
[48:30] into that realm so we know then that
[48:33] that be the way with repentance the
[48:35] blessings of the lord are exactly the
[48:37] same way now mind you i'm going to have
[48:39] to kind of
[48:40] skim through some of this have to do
[48:42] your homework later because i can't get
[48:44] all these scriptures in and be out of
[48:45] here at a reasonable time
[48:46] but when we look at what jesus said
[48:48] about the rain
[48:50] remember the rain is a type of the holy
[48:52] ghost as we know
[48:53] we go back into the days of moses
[48:55] whenever the manna
[48:56] was falling the manna had rained down
[48:59] out of heaven that was a type
[49:01] of the holy ghost and then jesus said
[49:03] that the rain
[49:04] falls on the just and it also falls
[49:07] on the unjust don't forget friends and
[49:10] let's not be
[49:11] deceived into believing that every
[49:13] person that feels the holy spirit
[49:15] is truly a child of god every person
[49:18] that walks on the face of this planet
[49:19] let a good rain come out of the heavens
[49:21] whether they're they could be
[49:23] the awfulest human being and i'll just
[49:25] hold back on making details of it
[49:27] but they could be the worst human being
[49:28] to ever walk the face of this planet
[49:30] and they can enjoy the rain the same
[49:34] as the best person to ever walk shoe
[49:36] leather because the rain
[49:37] and the sun and all of that it shines
[49:40] and it rains and it falls
[49:41] upon any human being that can walk out
[49:44] upon
[49:45] the face of this earth the same way with
[49:47] the blessings of god
[49:49] god can bless any person i don't care
[49:51] who they are
[49:52] whether they be a prostitute whether
[49:54] they be a drunkard whether it be a liar
[49:56] whether they be any part of them that
[49:58] may not have any christianity at all
[50:00] if they learn how to operate the law of
[50:03] god
[50:03] they can be blessed to a degree uh many
[50:06] years ago i was in
[50:07] in concert with a brother a pastor in
[50:10] the message that
[50:11] had taught his children to always pay
[50:14] tithes and pay offerings now this one
[50:16] young man
[50:16] he was a uh he was a businessman a very
[50:19] successful businessman
[50:20] he spent a lot of his time building up
[50:23] businesses and let me tell you something
[50:24] his own father would say
[50:26] this is the most deceitful cruel
[50:28] backbiting undercut human being
[50:30] on the face of the planet when he made a
[50:32] business deal if he thought that she was
[50:34] going to cheat you
[50:35] that just made the whole deal that much
[50:36] sweeter for him but this man had been
[50:39] taught
[50:39] to pay tithes and to give offerings and
[50:42] because
[50:43] he had always been faithful paying ties
[50:45] and had always been
[50:47] faithful to paying offerings he said his
[50:49] own father would testify
[50:50] this low down this low down creature my
[50:53] son that needs the baptism of the holy
[50:55] ghost and needs to get saved
[50:57] worse than any person i know i've
[50:59] watched god bless him in a degree
[51:01] because he would do that much of the
[51:04] word and that's true
[51:05] the prophet talked about how that a
[51:07] prostitute could walk up through the
[51:09] prayer line
[51:10] hear the gospel of salvation hear the
[51:12] gospel of healing
[51:14] and step right into that atmosphere and
[51:16] believe the lord for healing
[51:18] and walk out on the platform completely
[51:21] healed and a staunch christian he said
[51:24] walk out completely defeated
[51:27] what we have to be careful of and please
[51:30] allow me a moment to plug this in here
[51:32] quickly before we go on
[51:33] and don't forget this what we've got to
[51:36] be mindful of is that
[51:37] blessings within itself does not
[51:41] make the approval from god for you
[51:44] if a person is blessed and what we call
[51:47] blessings i think a lot of time is just
[51:50] maybe they've just learned how to work
[51:51] on the devil's side a little bit
[51:55] you know satan has the ability to make
[51:57] things happen in the world
[51:59] i'll agree with that i'm sure i mean
[52:01] let's just face facts elections and
[52:03] things like that are decided
[52:05] let's not be let's not be simple in our
[52:08] mind let's
[52:09] let's think deeply really we say well
[52:11] the lord is the one that puts the kings
[52:13] in and puts the kings out i agree with
[52:15] that
[52:15] but also the devil has a big say in how
[52:18] all of that operates
[52:19] he knows how to rally people together he
[52:21] knows how to put this together and that
[52:23] politic together and this thing together
[52:25] and satan knows exactly how to construct
[52:28] the perfect plan and god just lets him
[52:30] do it because whatever god's will is
[52:33] he's going to allow the devil to do what
[52:35] he needs to do
[52:36] in order to work out the plan of god
[52:39] hey listen i'm just i'm just as hurt and
[52:41] deeply and cry every night that trump
[52:43] didn't get in a second time just like
[52:44] you are i cry every night about it just
[52:46] like you do
[52:48] but somehow another almighty god had a
[52:51] purpose
[52:52] in the way that our election went just
[52:54] this past election
[52:56] there is a reason that things don't go
[52:58] in a certain direction
[52:59] and there's a reason some people are
[53:01] what we call blessed in this life
[53:04] and a reason why some people aren't
[53:07] i'm going to try my best to burst this
[53:09] little balloon
[53:10] that some of us live under tonight and
[53:14] pardon me if you wondering what i'm
[53:15] doing uh my uh
[53:17] my uh my i've got that little device on
[53:19] did i tell you about it my sugar's on
[53:21] that thing and it keeps trying to go out
[53:22] on me and i'm trying to keep it alive
[53:24] where i can walk
[53:27] but you remember when we were talking
[53:29] some time ago
[53:32] let me just let me just lay this in to
[53:34] you quickly before we go into the real
[53:35] depth of what i want to say
[53:38] we were talking some time ago here at
[53:39] the church sometime last year
[53:42] about you know how that sometimes people
[53:44] feel like
[53:46] if god really loved them that he would
[53:49] bless them
[53:50] with abundances remember us talking
[53:52] about this some time ago
[53:53] well that particular talk here is what
[53:55] led me into this tonight
[53:57] and i guess i've shared this with half
[53:59] the country already just in the last few
[54:01] months
[54:02] and the thing that i discovered when i
[54:04] was preaching this is how many people
[54:07] actually tie god's love and his approval
[54:10] and favor
[54:12] to the level of what they think is
[54:14] blessings
[54:19] and what we've got to be careful of is
[54:21] we've got to realize
[54:22] blessings are not always what we think
[54:25] blessings are
[54:28] i'm glad y'all are hollering amen to
[54:30] that because what we're getting ready to
[54:31] get into might be a little sticky
[54:34] are you ready galatians chapter 3
[54:38] verse 13. now the blessing for the bride
[54:41] is not necessarily financial
[54:45] right a lot of times god's children are
[54:48] not rich people
[54:50] as far as paying tithes and things go i
[54:53] hear a lot of preachers preaching about
[54:54] how that god will bless you financially
[54:56] but listen if you pay your tithes and
[54:57] offers god does a whole lot more than
[54:59] bless you financially
[55:01] he blesses your prayer life he'll bless
[55:04] your marriage
[55:05] he'll bless your walk with god he'll
[55:06] give you peace come on now
[55:09] he'll bless you in a whole lot more ways
[55:10] than just money
[55:15] the bible said that a wise man leaves an
[55:17] inheritance
[55:18] to his children i've been thinking about
[55:21] this for a couple of weeks myself
[55:23] being a daddy and i've got girls coming
[55:24] up i think what kind of inheritance
[55:26] can i leave for them i keep thinking
[55:28] lord with as much money as goes out in
[55:30] this ministry on
[55:31] gas and all these other kind of things i
[55:33] better get to me a job at mcdonald's
[55:34] pretty quick
[55:35] or walmart greeter or something i better
[55:39] start stocking up and it seemed like i
[55:40] was going into the store the other day
[55:42] and it seemed like the holy spirit said
[55:43] to me is that the only thing you think
[55:45] inheritance is
[55:49] that's not the only part of inheritance
[55:52] how about leaving for them the ability
[55:53] to know how to pray
[55:55] how to love how to read the bible how to
[55:58] behave in church
[56:00] how to treat other people is that not
[56:02] also friends
[56:03] a type of an inheritance that we can
[56:05] leave for our children
[56:06] well don't the world leave that type of
[56:08] inheritance for their people
[56:10] how they treat them and how they speak
[56:11] and how they act sure it's on the
[56:13] negative side of course
[56:14] but don't they leave that inheritance
[56:16] for the next generation
[56:17] how to steal and how to deceive and how
[56:20] to punch somebody in their mouth that
[56:21] they talk cross to you
[56:24] well if that be an inheritance for them
[56:26] why don't we leave the same kind of
[56:27] inheritance only on the positive side to
[56:30] our children how to talk
[56:31] how to act how to behave
[56:34] how to love what greater inheritance
[56:37] could i leave to my children than to
[56:39] teach them
[56:40] how to find out what 10 of their money
[56:42] is
[56:44] it's really not that hard of all of the
[56:47] mathematics we want our children to
[56:48] learn
[56:49] that's the one problem we never let them
[56:51] figure out
[56:53] and it cripples them you say how do you
[56:56] know because i was one of those kids
[56:59] because my mother and father was raised
[57:00] up in a generation of people that were
[57:01] told just take your money and send it
[57:03] down to jeff
[57:05] just send it off because it wasn't
[57:07] harder than the preachers around the
[57:08] area we was that to have confidence in
[57:10] enough to give them money
[57:12] mom and dad just kind of have the idea
[57:13] well we'll do it in this way and that
[57:15] way and the other so i never was taught
[57:17] to pay tithes
[57:19] hang on but i was
[57:22] it was 2003 when i moved to tennessee
[57:25] before
[57:26] i even learned how to do it
[57:29] hallelujah well we're gonna get down to
[57:33] some real confession time here
[57:38] because i was taught don't do it
[57:41] i could read the bible like you could
[57:42] but i didn't understand what i was doing
[57:44] i didn't understand the emphasis of what
[57:46] i needed to do
[57:48] every time i'd get money the lord would
[57:49] tell me you didn't pay tithes on that i
[57:51] said well
[57:52] where am i slow setting them how am i
[57:54] supposed to do it
[57:55] i didn't have an understanding a bit
[57:56] more than a man in china's expression
[57:58] goes
[58:00] and then i went to work at pizza hut
[58:03] with
[58:04] reverend dale potter
[58:08] now if you knew anything about brother
[58:09] dale there wasn't a tie i used to have a
[58:12] little pencil bag that i used to keep
[58:14] the tips in
[58:15] and when we would come back with the end
[58:17] of the night we had to cash out so much
[58:18] of the money they give us to start with
[58:20] and turn back so much of that at the end
[58:23] of the night
[58:24] i lost count of the times he would walk
[58:27] to that register
[58:28] and first words out of his mouth are you
[58:31] gonna pay tithes and offers off that
[58:32] aren't you son
[58:38] because god knew i had a genuine desire
[58:40] to do the right thing
[58:41] i wanted to know how to do it how in the
[58:43] world did i get in the middle of this
[58:45] here we are
[58:48] and here he come all of a sudden i
[58:50] thought one night i thought
[58:52] i've escaped him and i was
[58:55] running out the back door i was so sick
[58:57] of hearing it
[59:01] and i got in my car i started that baby
[59:04] up i heard crap crap crap
[59:06] crap crap crap
[59:09] i rolled my window down he goes you
[59:10] didn't pay ties and offers on that money
[59:12] tonight didn't he
[59:16] now mind you i had stockpiled for about
[59:18] two months
[59:21] every dime i had ever made didn't spend
[59:23] a dime of it
[59:24] because i was scared to death
[59:28] and all at once i sat down and started
[59:31] praying
[59:32] lord i'm so confused what am i supposed
[59:35] to do about all this
[59:37] and the holy spirit very simply very
[59:39] sweetly
[59:40] allows several things to come along in
[59:42] my life that just taught me
[59:43] this is how you do it this is how you
[59:46] handle it
[59:47] this is what you do i have lost
[59:50] count of the times in 17 years
[59:53] full-time ministry 18 actually this
[59:55] night to the 19th of may
[59:58] 18 years of full-time ministry i can
[1:00:01] tell you not
[1:00:01] one time but what god had always showed
[1:00:04] up for me
[1:00:05] and has always blessed me and has always
[1:00:08] took care of me
[1:00:10] after the vote over yonder most of you
[1:00:11] knew i got a salary when i was at the
[1:00:13] church
[1:00:13] out there it was about a thousand
[1:00:15] dollars a month that's what i brought
[1:00:16] and i used that for preaching
[1:00:19] and when i the vote had changed and the
[1:00:21] church changed hands i had lost that
[1:00:22] particular
[1:00:23] uh money because all of the salaries
[1:00:25] would go away my mother david took over
[1:00:28] that was just part of their program what
[1:00:29] they had i told the lord i said god
[1:00:33] that thousand dollars is pretty
[1:00:34] important to me and i was standing in an
[1:00:37] airport
[1:00:37] getting ready to fly to philadelphia and
[1:00:40] i had my ipod with me and i was just
[1:00:41] going to scroll through and find the
[1:00:43] message to preach
[1:00:44] uh to listen to brother the brahmin
[1:00:46] preached and i took my ipod and i went
[1:00:48] like this i went
[1:00:51] and the first words out of brother
[1:00:52] branham's mouth was i could stand here
[1:00:55] all day and testify to you that if you
[1:00:58] make a dollar
[1:00:59] give god 10 cents and you're offering
[1:01:01] and he'll always take care of you and i
[1:01:03] thank you lord
[1:01:06] and he has he has always taken care of
[1:01:10] us
[1:01:13] now we say blessings of god actually
[1:01:16] that was a blessing to me not because of
[1:01:18] the money part
[1:01:20] but because it was an area of my life
[1:01:22] that i needed correction in
[1:01:26] actually i needed understanding more
[1:01:27] than i needed correction it was never
[1:01:29] that i had an
[1:01:30] unwilling heart to do the right thing i
[1:01:31] just didn't know what to do hey listen
[1:01:33] folks when you're raised up in a return
[1:01:35] ministry church no
[1:01:37] the thing you hear is going to be a bit
[1:01:39] more even know how to love somebody or
[1:01:42] pray much less anything else everything
[1:01:45] i learned
[1:01:46] i learned it from the preachers that i
[1:01:48] followed and i learned it from the holy
[1:01:49] spirit with my bible and this message
[1:01:51] open
[1:01:51] teaching me just like i explained to you
[1:01:53] just now
[1:01:55] that's a blessing of god but it comes
[1:01:58] with hardship sometimes
[1:02:01] lord you got a hold of the car steering
[1:02:03] wheel tonight i'm just going to let you
[1:02:04] do the driving okay
[1:02:07] now let's read this in in galatians look
[1:02:08] at this in
[1:02:10] chapter 3 verse 13 christ hath redeemed
[1:02:13] us from the curse of the law
[1:02:14] being made a curse for us for it is
[1:02:17] written
[1:02:18] watch us now curse it as every man
[1:02:20] everyone that hangeth on a tree
[1:02:23] that the blessing of abraham
[1:02:29] might come on the gentiles through chief
[1:02:32] jesus christ through
[1:02:36] faith
[1:02:41] what a strange way to couple together
[1:02:45] blessings cursed is one that hangs on a
[1:02:49] tree
[1:02:51] that we could be blessed so the very
[1:02:54] precursor to your blessing
[1:02:56] is hanging on a tree
[1:02:59] now friends if the blessing of abraham
[1:03:02] is important for you and i
[1:03:03] then there must have been something in
[1:03:05] that man's life that we can parallel
[1:03:07] out today would you agree there must be
[1:03:10] some similar something in his life to us
[1:03:16] somehow we're a match piece if we
[1:03:18] receive the blessing of abraham
[1:03:20] it's going to come the same way it came
[1:03:21] to abraham all right let's look at it
[1:03:25] paul's speaking about the cross as we
[1:03:28] know this is the tree refers to
[1:03:30] the cross that jesus hung on
[1:03:33] he had to hang there before the blessing
[1:03:35] could come on you and i
[1:03:36] is that right and jesus said you take up
[1:03:40] your cross
[1:03:42] so in order for us to be fully blessed
[1:03:44] and receive
[1:03:45] the full blessing of god not just the
[1:03:47] partial blessing now
[1:03:48] as i said before some come up so far and
[1:03:51] they stop
[1:03:54] i mean let's take for example elvis
[1:03:55] presley was elvis blessed with a good
[1:03:57] voice
[1:03:57] yes brother brown said jesus gave the
[1:04:01] boy a good voice
[1:04:03] a lot of these rock and roll singers and
[1:04:04] these pop and r b
[1:04:06] and neo soul and funk and all these guys
[1:04:08] can they sing show they can
[1:04:09] can they play music sure they can
[1:04:12] they've been blessed with gifts to be
[1:04:14] able to unlock the gift of music
[1:04:17] god's the one to give them that
[1:04:20] that is unless you don't believe james 1
[1:04:22] 17 that said every good and perfect gift
[1:04:25] cometh down from the father of lights
[1:04:29] a perfect gift can come to you but it's
[1:04:33] what you do with that gift
[1:04:35] that's going to determine its perfection
[1:04:38] remember you can take a gift
[1:04:40] of god and send yourself to hell with it
[1:04:47] let's look at some of the preachers in
[1:04:49] our uh our lifetime
[1:04:52] could preach could exhort had great
[1:04:54] charisma had the ability to take the
[1:04:55] bible and thread things together on and
[1:04:57] on and on and on
[1:04:58] and then turned around and deceived a
[1:05:00] bunch of people
[1:05:02] sent their soul right to hell i mean
[1:05:04] friends don't you understand
[1:05:06] that the most dangerous human being on
[1:05:09] the planet
[1:05:10] is a religious one without the holy
[1:05:12] ghost
[1:05:14] well you say that's not so dangerous
[1:05:16] really let's look at apparel
[1:05:18] if a man walked in this back door right
[1:05:19] now with a gun and his hand started
[1:05:20] blowing us away
[1:05:22] and there was 30 of us went by the way
[1:05:24] of the grave what's more dangerous him
[1:05:26] coming in here
[1:05:27] and taking out 30 of us
[1:05:30] or some deceiving preacher standing on a
[1:05:32] television and preaching to 5 billion
[1:05:34] people around the world
[1:05:35] and leading them all into the world
[1:05:36] council of churches in the mark of the
[1:05:38] beast tell me who's more dangerous
[1:05:43] religion has always been the most
[1:05:45] deceiving
[1:05:46] dangerous thing that a person could play
[1:05:50] with
[1:05:53] praise god saints
[1:05:59] satan is not a dangerous person because
[1:06:01] he's a drunk or a drug addict
[1:06:04] satan is dangerous as he's religious for
[1:06:07] the bread
[1:06:08] he knows the bible he knows the message
[1:06:10] he understands supernatural things and
[1:06:12] elements of supernatural
[1:06:13] gifts and workings and outworkings of
[1:06:15] the holy spirit he understands every bit
[1:06:16] of that
[1:06:17] that's what makes him dangerous
[1:06:26] so you take an individual that's going
[1:06:27] to really come to the full blessing of
[1:06:30] god
[1:06:31] listen there is a
[1:06:34] way that they must choose
[1:06:38] if they want to be really truly
[1:06:40] genuinely blessed by god
[1:06:43] jesus referred to it as the broadway and
[1:06:46] the narrow way
[1:06:49] many be that find the broad way but he
[1:06:51] said few
[1:06:52] will find the narrow why because it's a
[1:06:55] rugged hard
[1:06:56] difficult it's full of crosses
[1:06:59] it's full of disappointments it's full
[1:07:01] of ups it's full of downs come on now
[1:07:04] it's not an easy way to serve
[1:07:06] christianity it's not an easy way to
[1:07:07] serve the lord
[1:07:08] i don't care what preacher tries to tell
[1:07:10] you it is christianity is not a flowery
[1:07:12] bed of ease
[1:07:16] and when they present it like it's a
[1:07:18] bunch of joys of shouting on the
[1:07:19] mountain all the time they are lying
[1:07:20] through their teeth that is not
[1:07:22] christianity
[1:07:23] christianity is bearing a cross
[1:07:29] oh you see but isn't there a blessing
[1:07:31] sure but i'll ask you
[1:07:33] some of you christians have been here
[1:07:34] serving the lord for many years if you
[1:07:36] want to take a piece of paper draw a
[1:07:37] line down the middle and put blessing on
[1:07:38] one side
[1:07:39] and burdens on the other how many
[1:07:41] tallies would you put in the bird inside
[1:07:48] more likely you'd probably outweigh what
[1:07:51] blessings you feel like you've received
[1:07:53] but this is the principle that paul is
[1:07:55] establishing that if you want the
[1:07:57] blessing of abraham
[1:08:00] there's a cross to bear
[1:08:04] jesus help us lord
[1:08:09] now let's take the life of abraham turn
[1:08:11] me to genesis chapter 17.
[1:08:16] this is what you call holy ghost
[1:08:17] autopilot tonight
[1:08:23] completely the opposite direction of
[1:08:24] where i intended to go but that's all
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:27] he the boss i just work here
[1:08:32] genesis 17 1
[1:08:36] look at this and when abram was 90 years
[1:08:39] old and nine
[1:08:41] the lord appeared to abram and said i am
[1:08:44] the almighty god
[1:08:45] praise the lord
[1:08:50] walk before me and be thou perfect
[1:08:56] wait a minute
[1:09:00] lord do you know that you're talking to
[1:09:03] a heathen
[1:09:06] are you aware of the fact you're talking
[1:09:07] to an idol worshiper
[1:09:10] are you aware of the fact you're talking
[1:09:11] to a non-un
[1:09:13] irreligious man who don't know nothing
[1:09:17] about you
[1:09:21] who has sat in his shop and watched his
[1:09:23] daddy carve idols on the tower of babel
[1:09:26] are you aware of that lord that you're
[1:09:27] talking to a man who's a heathen
[1:09:30] even his name abram that was not a
[1:09:33] gentile
[1:09:34] christian like matthew luke
[1:09:40] there's a heathen name that didn't come
[1:09:44] from the bible
[1:09:46] because you see the bible wasn't he
[1:09:47] wrote yet
[1:09:50] when you read that book genesis the one
[1:09:52] that opened on your lap
[1:09:53] moses wrote that many many years after
[1:09:56] the life of abraham
[1:09:58] so there's no bible here that's gone
[1:10:01] that's out
[1:10:03] there's no church there's no pastor
[1:10:05] there's no preaching
[1:10:06] there's no music there's no singing
[1:10:08] there's worship the man is a heathen
[1:10:11] and god is asking him
[1:10:14] to walk in perfection
[1:10:20] it makes you wonder sometimes if the
[1:10:23] lord really knows what he's doing
[1:10:25] when he does things
[1:10:30] read these things in the bible you think
[1:10:31] god aren't you aware
[1:10:35] in our carnal mind the way we would read
[1:10:39] the scripture that would be the way we
[1:10:40] would approach it
[1:10:42] you know y'all are looking at me but
[1:10:44] that's exactly the attitude we have a
[1:10:46] lot of times when the lord chooses to
[1:10:47] bless somebody
[1:10:49] and work with them and anoint them and
[1:10:52] save them
[1:10:53] and fill them with the holy ghost or
[1:10:55] something great with their lives
[1:10:57] we may not ever speak it out of our
[1:10:58] little mealy mouths but there's a big
[1:11:00] part of us that's in the back of our
[1:11:01] mind going
[1:11:02] don't you know who that is lord
[1:11:07] oh i know some of you holy cherubims
[1:11:09] tonight are too holy to be able to say
[1:11:10] man any of this but
[1:11:13] the saints of god had the same problem
[1:11:15] when they saw saul
[1:11:16] walk in the door god changed his name to
[1:11:18] paul but remember they knew him as saul
[1:11:22] and the bible said they were afraid of
[1:11:24] him because they thought he was a spy
[1:11:30] that's what i love about my lord when he
[1:11:31] makes choices
[1:11:33] it may not make sense to you or i but it
[1:11:36] fits
[1:11:39] because once god gets done with this man
[1:11:41] it's going to fit
[1:11:44] praise god same with you when god gets
[1:11:47] done with you
[1:11:50] you're going to be like a hand in the
[1:11:51] glove
[1:11:53] don't ever worry that you won't have a
[1:11:55] place in the body of christ
[1:11:56] that's why he's been working on you all
[1:11:58] these years
[1:12:00] getting him rough edges off you and
[1:12:02] getting you honed down
[1:12:04] because he's got a spot in his mind
[1:12:05] where you fit in this great pyramid of
[1:12:07] god and he's just waiting to get you
[1:12:09] the right spot to go
[1:12:14] as long as you got that temper or
[1:12:15] whatever it is he's working on it's
[1:12:17] going to be hard for you to fit in there
[1:12:18] he's been jamming it like trying to put
[1:12:19] a square peg
[1:12:20] around hole so he got to keep chopping
[1:12:23] at you
[1:12:24] whoo preach by the bin
[1:12:28] now as he keeps working on me as he
[1:12:30] keeps shaving me down
[1:12:33] i've got to place a position
[1:12:36] but this is as rough as it gets this
[1:12:39] is not an easy thing that's happening
[1:12:41] here come on folks
[1:12:45] god is asking a heathen to walk in
[1:12:48] perfection
[1:12:49] how is abraham going to do this if god
[1:12:53] asks us to do something like this
[1:12:54] then the lord is obligated
[1:12:58] to make a way for us to do exactly what
[1:13:00] he asked us ever do
[1:13:04] it's gone well i feel the holy ghost
[1:13:09] watch this in verse 2 and i'll make my
[1:13:11] covenant
[1:13:12] aren't you glad you said it is
[1:13:16] between me and thee and i will multiply
[1:13:19] thee exceedingly
[1:13:22] and abram jumped up and said hallelujah
[1:13:25] hallelujah praise our god
[1:13:30] now you're looking at me when you should
[1:13:31] be looking at verse three
[1:13:39] because abram was like you and i
[1:13:42] when god tells us things sometimes
[1:13:47] he fell on his face and left
[1:13:58] me
[1:14:03] pardon me lord but don't you know that
[1:14:05] i'm 99 years old a little bit
[1:14:07] just a bit too old to have children
[1:14:11] aren't you aware
[1:14:15] you know sometimes i think the lord
[1:14:16] could talk to us i think he'd almost
[1:14:18] smack us in the back of the head and say
[1:14:20] dummy of course i know these things
[1:14:25] i don't need your input just hush and do
[1:14:28] what i'm asking you to do
[1:14:32] we gotta get our fingers and every
[1:14:34] little thing that moves
[1:14:37] and just like abram we fall down and we
[1:14:40] laugh sometimes don't think we don't
[1:14:42] don't think we don't sometimes the very
[1:14:45] things that god
[1:14:46] asked us to do we considered to be
[1:14:49] ridiculous
[1:14:52] sure but here's what i love about abram
[1:14:56] well god made this covenant with him
[1:14:58] watch here and verse 4 as for me behold
[1:15:01] my covenant is with thee
[1:15:03] notice god didn't say abraham
[1:15:06] if you'll be a good boy and you'll
[1:15:08] behave yourself for the next 25 years
[1:15:10] i'll do this for you god said i've
[1:15:12] already done it
[1:15:15] search your bible now
[1:15:18] i've already accomplished my vision
[1:15:22] praise god i'm just going to set the
[1:15:26] thing up and you're going to be a part
[1:15:28] of it
[1:15:28] whether you like it or not
[1:15:35] so for 25 years abram
[1:15:38] abra abram had to bear this cross right
[1:15:40] here
[1:15:42] of god coming to him and saying walk
[1:15:45] do you know that abram never even heard
[1:15:48] where
[1:15:49] he was supposed to walk
[1:15:52] y'all got that part right god never told
[1:15:55] him where
[1:15:57] he just said walk what a crazy thing
[1:16:01] where am i going lord it's none of your
[1:16:02] business just keep walking
[1:16:08] we're not built that way are we
[1:16:14] when the lord speaks to us we want to
[1:16:16] know time
[1:16:17] date we want our own little special gps
[1:16:20] established for our predestinated value
[1:16:23] we want to be able to come in to christ
[1:16:25] and him tell us to do something when
[1:16:26] we'd be able to go boop boop
[1:16:27] boop boop turn left at lady oseah
[1:16:32] go straight through to peace in point
[1:16:35] four of a mile you will have victory
[1:16:37] in point twelve of a mile you you'll
[1:16:40] come out of this trial and you'll turn
[1:16:42] right at joy we would
[1:16:45] love to have such a thing you talk about
[1:16:48] a preacher becoming a
[1:16:49] multi-multi-trillionaire
[1:16:51] if you could invent a system that would
[1:16:53] tell them what the next few minutes of
[1:16:54] their life would behold you'd be
[1:16:56] you'd be wealthy overnight
[1:17:00] because as human beings we always want
[1:17:02] to see the end of the picture
[1:17:06] but god reserves to his own will
[1:17:09] matters like that he just tells us to
[1:17:13] walk
[1:17:15] and expects us to do
[1:17:18] what he asked
[1:17:23] i might not be running all over the
[1:17:25] platform tonight but man are we
[1:17:27] preaching deep tonight
[1:17:30] bone deep soul deep spirit deep life
[1:17:33] deep
[1:17:35] well you say but brother ben i want god
[1:17:37] to bless me
[1:17:38] huh do you what kind of blessings are
[1:17:41] you talking about the one man went down
[1:17:43] to church you go
[1:17:49] or when you get up in the morning you
[1:17:50] look in your bank account and there's 40
[1:17:52] million dollars in your account
[1:17:53] glory to god if some of you all had
[1:17:57] money like that drop into your bank
[1:17:58] account you would be backslid in five
[1:18:00] minutes
[1:18:04] because the whole world would come off
[1:18:05] your shoulders and everything else in
[1:18:07] your life would be beneath you from that
[1:18:09] moment on
[1:18:10] it'd be beneath you to go to church with
[1:18:12] them a bunch of poor people be beneath
[1:18:13] you to drive the cars like they drive
[1:18:18] it's one reason god don't bless us with
[1:18:20] such things like that because we
[1:18:21] wouldn't take that attitude
[1:18:23] it would be beneath us
[1:18:30] so god said i'm going to make a covenant
[1:18:33] and this covenant i'm going to swear it
[1:18:36] by me because i know already you can't
[1:18:39] keep this
[1:18:41] i mean god hadn't even got the words out
[1:18:43] of his mouth and abraham's already
[1:18:44] cackling
[1:18:51] not only is he laughing but he falls on
[1:18:52] his face laughing
[1:18:56] you know what i love about jesus what i
[1:18:58] love about the lord
[1:18:59] none of this discouraged him none of
[1:19:02] this made jesus feel hurt at abram
[1:19:04] none of this made him take a big step
[1:19:06] back and go oh might as well give up
[1:19:07] this boy never going to get it
[1:19:09] you see that's the thing about him he
[1:19:10] already knows what kind of reaction
[1:19:12] we're going to give him
[1:19:14] but those reactions like that one
[1:19:17] are only for a moment in time god ain't
[1:19:20] looking for those little
[1:19:22] micro tiny moments in our life to where
[1:19:24] we're gonna be like this
[1:19:28] because he knows the entire end of the
[1:19:30] journey remember predestination that's
[1:19:32] the mystery and the secret
[1:19:33] of predestination is that god knows what
[1:19:36] you were predestinated to
[1:19:39] because of his foreknowledge he can look
[1:19:42] all the way down through the pathway of
[1:19:43] your life and tell what you're going to
[1:19:44] do and where you're going to wind up
[1:19:46] and what kind of choices you're going to
[1:19:48] make
[1:19:50] that's why i said jacob i loved he saw
[1:19:52] hated he didn't hate esau just because
[1:19:53] he just didn't like the boy
[1:19:56] the hatred he had toward esau was a
[1:19:58] perfect hatred
[1:20:02] a god hatred
[1:20:05] does god despise that anti-spirit
[1:20:12] i know it's hard to quote to the saint
[1:20:14] john 3 16 people when you got that one
[1:20:16] laying in their hand
[1:20:18] i thought god loved you also said if
[1:20:20] you'll reject me i'll laugh at your
[1:20:21] calamity i'll make fun of you
[1:20:25] because the lord don't play around when
[1:20:26] it comes to these things
[1:20:28] we either take it seriously or we meet
[1:20:30] the end of the we meet we meet it down
[1:20:32] at the end of the road
[1:20:36] ah you say oh brother ben
[1:20:39] why did god do this to abram he was
[1:20:41] going to bless him
[1:20:43] that's why but before the blessing could
[1:20:46] come
[1:20:48] abram was going to have to pick up a
[1:20:50] cross and bear it for a while
[1:20:55] could you imagine what it must have
[1:20:56] looked like it's supper that night
[1:21:01] when he sets down next to little
[1:21:03] white-haired sarah
[1:21:05] maybe a little shawl around her
[1:21:06] shoulders round-rimmed glasses on the
[1:21:09] end of her nose
[1:21:12] she got wrinkles all over her face and
[1:21:14] her arms and
[1:21:16] her age is showing and him sit down
[1:21:18] there and she
[1:21:19] take one of them great big old thick
[1:21:22] steaks and lay it down before him and
[1:21:23] set some of that goat milk on the table
[1:21:25] and he goes
[1:21:28] i got something to tell you
[1:21:33] well what is it
[1:21:37] you're gonna be your mother
[1:21:44] what why'd you say speak up
[1:21:49] you know my hearing's about god i can't
[1:21:51] hear you will you mambo
[1:21:54] i said god met me today and told me i'm
[1:21:57] going to be a father of nations and
[1:21:59] you're going to be the mother
[1:22:02] i imagine it wasn't the first time that
[1:22:04] sarah had laughed at this
[1:22:06] when the angel saw her in the tent
[1:22:09] i imagine it wasn't the first time she
[1:22:11] laughed
[1:22:13] she probably had watched this man carry
[1:22:16] this on
[1:22:17] you know how people are sometimes you
[1:22:18] have hard families people will say
[1:22:20] things and you
[1:22:22] just humor them for a while you know it
[1:22:24] happens that way in the sports world and
[1:22:26] and other type of venues and professions
[1:22:28] and things like that you know you take
[1:22:30] some kid when he's a boy and he's going
[1:22:32] to be a professional wrestler some
[1:22:33] spindly little skinny thing don't even
[1:22:35] have a muscle on him the next thing you
[1:22:37] know he becomes like hulk hogan or one
[1:22:38] of these guys
[1:22:40] and people laugh at him for years yeah
[1:22:43] sure
[1:22:44] until the vision comes together and then
[1:22:47] he accomplishes the very thing that was
[1:22:48] in his heart
[1:22:49] when people were laughing at him abraham
[1:22:51] was probably this kind of man
[1:22:53] he probably was known throughout town to
[1:22:55] be a little
[1:23:03] you know one of these days i'm going to
[1:23:04] be a daddy
[1:23:08] and maybe somebody in the tool shop that
[1:23:10] night
[1:23:13] poor old abraham
[1:23:17] i've never seen him this bad you know
[1:23:20] they got that new thing out there they
[1:23:22] say eating all that
[1:23:23] drinking all the goats milk and that
[1:23:24] cow's milk gives people that
[1:23:25] forgetfulness like that
[1:23:28] that's what's happened to him he's
[1:23:29] ingested too much of that goat's milk
[1:23:31] and his brain is deteriorating
[1:23:35] but you know the bible said and i i
[1:23:38] would be persuaded to believe if we
[1:23:40] looked at this in real time
[1:23:42] not the fantasy world that is created in
[1:23:44] our minds through evangelistical
[1:23:45] preaching and the dramas that are set
[1:23:47] before us
[1:23:48] but if you looked at this in real time
[1:23:53] abram is walking along the road and god
[1:23:55] stops him in his tracks
[1:23:58] and speaks to him the whole thing
[1:24:01] probably took as a matter of a few
[1:24:03] minutes
[1:24:04] the holy ghost left him he went on about
[1:24:06] his business a normal day like everybody
[1:24:08] else
[1:24:08] and then god left him sat there like
[1:24:11] that
[1:24:11] for years before he ever spoke to him
[1:24:15] again
[1:24:22] speak to us tonight lord
[1:24:28] people probably thought something is
[1:24:30] wrong with this man i imagine he
[1:24:31] probably thought it himself
[1:24:34] there was probably a great portion of
[1:24:36] his own thinking
[1:24:39] how could this be but you see when the
[1:24:41] lord meets
[1:24:42] you when you really have an experience
[1:24:44] like that with god
[1:24:45] it leaves such a mark on you that you
[1:24:49] can't doubt that it happened
[1:24:51] you can't deny that it took place and
[1:24:53] you cannot figure out
[1:24:54] why either
[1:25:00] people get in their mind when brethren
[1:25:01] had these great experiences and many of
[1:25:03] these men of god had these great
[1:25:04] experiences
[1:25:05] that they always understood every word
[1:25:06] of it they did not don't be deceived
[1:25:10] many times that god would meet brother
[1:25:11] branham he was standing there coming out
[1:25:13] of a vision he said the other day i
[1:25:14] heard him he said i stand with my hand
[1:25:16] out like this screaming
[1:25:19] not knowing it was not going to be the
[1:25:22] end of my life
[1:25:22] thank you it was going to be the end of
[1:25:26] my lilac to him he didn't come down and
[1:25:27] speak to on the whole of the matter he
[1:25:28] just let him
[1:25:29] go through the vision he'd come right
[1:25:30] out of the experience he knew it was god
[1:25:32] but he couldn't explain it
[1:25:36] abram was the same way he comes right
[1:25:39] out of this
[1:25:41] how many months minutes years
[1:25:44] days i was preaching this other day
[1:25:49] i think it was in kentucky somewhere
[1:25:50] another and uh over on the other side of
[1:25:52] kentucky down by
[1:25:53] lexington side down there and there was
[1:25:55] a little girl come up to me after
[1:25:56] service and she
[1:25:57] rang off it was some kind of like it was
[1:25:59] in the hundred thousand some kind of a
[1:26:01] number
[1:26:01] how many days it was she was sitting
[1:26:03] there doing the math after i'd just
[1:26:06] how many minutes how many days how many
[1:26:08] hours did he have to sit and wait
[1:26:10] in the beginning i doubt that abraham
[1:26:12] even believed it himself
[1:26:15] but it could not get away from the
[1:26:17] presence
[1:26:19] of the impression of that supernatural
[1:26:21] that had met him on his walk
[1:26:24] and told him walk before me abraham
[1:26:28] you can't deny them things when god
[1:26:30] meets you like that there nobody can
[1:26:32] talk you out of it
[1:26:33] that's why i said about these outfits
[1:26:35] out here running around putting websites
[1:26:36] up and these people
[1:26:37] around trying to trash the message and
[1:26:38] put preachers down and all that
[1:26:40] they never met god about one time in
[1:26:42] their life because i'm telling you right
[1:26:43] now brother
[1:26:44] if you ever meet the god of this message
[1:26:46] and the god of this bible there's not a
[1:26:48] website there's not a preacher there's
[1:26:49] not a hypocrite
[1:26:50] there's not a saying there's nobody can
[1:26:52] talk you out of the thing that god
[1:26:54] places inside of your heart
[1:26:59] because when the lord makes an entrance
[1:27:01] into your life
[1:27:02] he leaves a lasting impression when he
[1:27:04] does it
[1:27:13] so here too he wakes up he looks in the
[1:27:15] mirror he's still an old man
[1:27:19] and yet he can hear the voice of god
[1:27:21] walk before me abraham
[1:27:24] and be thou perfect god could have spoke
[1:27:26] to him again sure but he didn't need to
[1:27:28] he had given abraham all of the advice
[1:27:30] he needed for that time
[1:27:33] all he needed to know was what god told
[1:27:35] him to do
[1:27:38] walk and don't you realize friends when
[1:27:41] you go back and look in your bible map
[1:27:42] you've got scofields and
[1:27:43] thompson thompson chains if it's got the
[1:27:46] map of abraham's walk in there go look
[1:27:47] at it
[1:27:48] his very footsteps is what put the
[1:27:50] borders of israel in place
[1:27:55] because everywhere he walked was the
[1:27:57] possession of god and that was the
[1:27:59] inheritance
[1:28:00] of the children of israel hallelujah
[1:28:03] even the very place that him and
[1:28:04] melchizedek
[1:28:05] had had communion on that's the very
[1:28:07] spot he said that the mountain will push
[1:28:10] up a new jerusalem will set right down
[1:28:11] on top of that mountain
[1:28:12] on the very spot
[1:28:15] that they had communion
[1:28:21] why did abraham come down letting god
[1:28:23] tell him abraham now
[1:28:24] you need to take this herb and this
[1:28:26] vitamin and you need to go to this
[1:28:28] gene replacement therapy and uh he told
[1:28:31] him everything he needed to do
[1:28:32] walk walk
[1:28:36] and be perfect
[1:28:40] okay lord so as we all know anytime
[1:28:43] you're starting out with anything you
[1:28:44] never start out perfect do you
[1:28:47] anybody ever play music
[1:28:50] they don't start out playing it
[1:28:52] perfectly i've been playing all my life
[1:28:54] i still hit bad notes and i still get
[1:28:55] rhythms off and i still miss things
[1:29:01] but i just keep walking one of the keys
[1:29:04] to music by the way you musicians in
[1:29:05] here is if you do hit a bad spot don't
[1:29:07] stop
[1:29:09] keep playing it's 99 percent of the time
[1:29:13] the people are sitting in the
[1:29:14] congregation or the audience or wherever
[1:29:15] they might be they can't understand what
[1:29:16] you're doing now they don't know you
[1:29:17] made a mistake
[1:29:20] so just keep going unless you're in
[1:29:23] competition like i was in the nationals
[1:29:25] when i was eight
[1:29:26] and my mistake was what caused me to
[1:29:28] lose the nationals
[1:29:30] it was obvious because we all get those
[1:29:33] blunders
[1:29:35] we all have those moments where you
[1:29:37] can't keep going
[1:29:39] that's one of those come fast moments
[1:29:41] stop everything until we get it
[1:29:42] straightened out
[1:29:43] but otherwise you just keep moving
[1:29:48] i played with some musicians where i
[1:29:50] needed to call a solemn fast
[1:29:53] they were messing everything up rhythms
[1:29:55] were off
[1:29:56] beads were off
[1:30:00] but if it's nothing major you just keep
[1:30:02] going right
[1:30:06] why stop if you're just going to stumble
[1:30:08] a little bit god said walk
[1:30:09] so that's the objective okay so if i
[1:30:12] start out
[1:30:13] left right left
[1:30:20] thank god he wasn't a sister you sister
[1:30:23] sisters that i had a hard time with that
[1:30:25] left and right
[1:30:27] you all ain't like my wife and my
[1:30:29] mother-in-law
[1:30:31] y'all know left and right well praise
[1:30:32] the lord got some good sisters in here
[1:30:35] even my little daughter of the day
[1:30:36] analysts put your left hand out schwinn
[1:30:44] i've i've met a lot of women that didn't
[1:30:46] know left and right that's all i'm
[1:30:47] saying
[1:30:49] there's an arkansas here the other day
[1:30:50] and it was all laughing
[1:30:53] there were six of them sitting there and
[1:30:55] said we were driving down the road and i
[1:30:56] told her i said turn left and she went
[1:30:58] right every time
[1:31:01] anyway but here went left
[1:31:06] left right maybe that right foot maybe
[1:31:09] he got on shaky ground
[1:31:12] his foot twisted a little bit maybe he
[1:31:16] stumbled maybe he fell down
[1:31:17] maybe he wasn't able to hold his
[1:31:20] position
[1:31:22] but what did god tell him to do
[1:31:29] really it's that simple so
[1:31:32] he didn't say you'll fall you'll stop
[1:31:35] you just said walk
[1:31:36] okay so god if that's the objective if
[1:31:39] i'm supposed to walk
[1:31:42] then everything else is secondary
[1:31:45] to what i'm supposed to do praise god
[1:31:50] same thing happens with you and i
[1:31:53] when god tells us to serve him to live
[1:31:55] for him to pray to love him
[1:31:57] to do whatever it might be
[1:32:00] he's not bringing into account the fact
[1:32:03] that you won't stumble
[1:32:04] you will the fact that you may not know
[1:32:07] left from right
[1:32:10] huh some of y'all are hung up on that
[1:32:14] thing agent
[1:32:17] i don't mean no harm it was something to
[1:32:19] make you smile
[1:32:25] but if a christian says all right god
[1:32:26] you want me to walk
[1:32:28] and they fall down on their face
[1:32:32] what am i supposed to do what was my
[1:32:33] orders
[1:32:35] lay there quit
[1:32:38] throw my hands up and blame the message
[1:32:41] blame the pastor blame the preacher
[1:32:43] blame the people
[1:32:46] i was told to walk
[1:32:49] so if i'm laying there and i'm squalling
[1:32:52] and feeling sorry for myself
[1:32:54] i'm not doing what the lord told me to
[1:32:55] do
[1:32:58] because god told me to walk
[1:33:02] so that's what i've got to do
[1:33:06] i've got to walk remember when it comes
[1:33:09] to
[1:33:10] another part of his journey god changes
[1:33:12] this man's name from abram to abraham
[1:33:15] you know that when he first meets the
[1:33:17] heathen king he lies about sarah
[1:33:20] and god meets this man in a dream he
[1:33:23] tells this man
[1:33:24] you've got another man's wife remember
[1:33:25] the story
[1:33:27] but look at it again after his name was
[1:33:29] changed
[1:33:30] abraham was still up to the same old
[1:33:33] tricks
[1:33:35] the moment he got confronted he got
[1:33:37] scared
[1:33:38] and he lied a second time
[1:33:41] and to show that something had really
[1:33:43] taken place
[1:33:45] this king had fallen in love with
[1:33:48] grandma
[1:33:51] praise god it goes to prove that the
[1:33:55] blessing that come to their bodies
[1:33:57] when god changed them back to a young
[1:33:59] man and a young woman praise the lord
[1:34:03] it was something that god had done for
[1:34:04] them after many years
[1:34:06] of
[1:34:12] when's it going to happen abraham could
[1:34:13] you imagine year 12
[1:34:16] they don't know that they've got all the
[1:34:19] new years left
[1:34:21] they're sitting at the dinner table she
[1:34:22] asked him when is god going to do this
[1:34:25] thing that god's supposed to do
[1:34:28] you sure you got it right abraham that's
[1:34:31] what he told me to do there
[1:34:33] well but i just don't see any
[1:34:35] manifestation of it he said i don't
[1:34:36] either but you know what the bible said
[1:34:38] he grew strong
[1:34:42] did you catch him words he grew
[1:34:45] strong in other words he didn't start
[1:34:48] that way
[1:34:50] i just read it to you we just read it
[1:34:51] together he did not
[1:34:53] start with that kind of supernatural
[1:34:56] strength to believe
[1:34:57] god and not stagger
[1:35:00] isn't it amazing when paul writes this
[1:35:02] man's divine commentary
[1:35:04] that he uses the words he
[1:35:07] did not stagger
[1:35:12] look at how paul took it and associated
[1:35:14] it right with what god told him to do
[1:35:16] walk
[1:35:21] because no matter how many times
[1:35:23] throughout his journey that he might
[1:35:24] have stumbled or he might have called it
[1:35:26] a
[1:35:27] maybe i thought it was in his mind
[1:35:30] i've missed the boat i've missed god
[1:35:32] altogether
[1:35:37] there was a tie post for him
[1:35:40] back here it actually goes back to
[1:35:42] genesis 12. if you want to look at the
[1:35:43] first time god spoke to him he tells him
[1:35:45] to separate himself from everybody
[1:35:46] and the bible said a lot went with him
[1:35:50] and god never didn't fully bless that
[1:35:51] man until he fully obeyed the lord
[1:35:54] that's one reason they had to cause the
[1:35:56] fuss between lot and abraham in the
[1:35:58] first place because lot needed to go
[1:36:02] just like you and i god wants to bless
[1:36:05] us beyond measure bless and abundance
[1:36:07] but we got a
[1:36:09] that we carry with us
[1:36:16] and sometimes you got to separate
[1:36:18] yourself from
[1:36:19] the lot that you carry
[1:36:27] you all amen again you've forgiven me
[1:36:29] for the left and right comment then amen
[1:36:32] good
[1:36:36] so here god speaks to this man and
[1:36:38] something is so impressed upon him
[1:36:41] that no matter what takes place in his
[1:36:43] body listen
[1:36:45] this was not 25 years of no doctor's
[1:36:48] visits no pains no eggs no sicknesses
[1:36:51] none of that he would wake up perhaps
[1:36:54] year 11
[1:36:54] might have been the worst year of his
[1:36:56] life he might have been sicker
[1:36:58] had worse arthritis he might have had
[1:37:00] rheumatism he might have been prone to
[1:37:02] fevers he might have been prone to all
[1:37:04] kinds of things who would have known
[1:37:06] maybe old abraham year 11 come to his
[1:37:08] deathbed
[1:37:12] we don't know because them years are
[1:37:13] silent in the scripture
[1:37:19] maybe the talk around town was yeah he
[1:37:21] almost bit it the other day
[1:37:23] bought the farm they say
[1:37:26] well you know he's 105 years old anyways
[1:37:30] still believing god's going to give him
[1:37:31] a son poor old fella
[1:37:34] well you know that's how old people are
[1:37:36] they get a little senile in those ages
[1:37:39] could you imagine what he would have had
[1:37:42] to endure
[1:37:43] from the conversation of the people
[1:37:44] around him that listen
[1:37:46] that never had his experience
[1:37:49] this is why they could ridicule they
[1:37:51] never had the experience this man had
[1:37:55] because as if god had met them the same
[1:37:58] way he had met abraham they would have
[1:37:59] never been laughing at him or making fun
[1:38:00] of it have been believing god with him
[1:38:03] this is why sometimes friends when the
[1:38:05] lord speaks to you be careful who you
[1:38:07] share it with
[1:38:09] because those people if they've not had
[1:38:10] your experience they never can put
[1:38:12] themselves in your shoes
[1:38:13] and they'll never be able to support you
[1:38:15] right
[1:38:24] maybe he'd wake up look in the mirror oh
[1:38:30] but he remembered
[1:38:36] whoa get the eye see hot sarah
[1:38:40] i am tore all the pieces
[1:38:45] the devil would probably come to this
[1:38:47] man and tell him don't forget the
[1:38:48] devil's a part of this equation
[1:38:50] satan probably come to him and said you
[1:38:52] know you
[1:38:53] you've lost it there's no way god's
[1:38:57] going to do this for you
[1:38:58] don't forget friends this was not the
[1:39:00] first time that god
[1:39:02] trans related to human body the devil
[1:39:07] knew that god had the ability to do it
[1:39:10] knowing that abraham didn't know about
[1:39:12] that kind of power
[1:39:14] he wasn't around when he knocked was
[1:39:16] around he wasn't around when abraham was
[1:39:17] around
[1:39:18] he was not he was not did not have the
[1:39:20] inside information as it was
[1:39:22] to know that god would translate a human
[1:39:24] being like this
[1:39:29] satan would say you're you're just
[1:39:33] something wrong with you but all of a
[1:39:36] sudden
[1:39:37] in his weakest moments he would draw
[1:39:39] back into that into his mind
[1:39:41] and go back to that place
[1:39:45] where he knew god met him you see
[1:39:49] this is why every single one of us
[1:39:52] must have a thai post come on preach to
[1:39:55] me somebody
[1:39:57] we've got to have somewhere we can go
[1:39:59] back to brother benham said what
[1:40:01] affected paul more than anything else is
[1:40:03] when he was standing there holding the
[1:40:04] code of stephen
[1:40:12] he said that paul's life
[1:40:16] this is a man that had already went
[1:40:19] through all kinds of things when it
[1:40:21] comes to the christian church and this
[1:40:23] one experience with stephen
[1:40:25] changes him you see the lord knows the
[1:40:27] right moment and the right time to get
[1:40:29] your attention
[1:40:34] so here he's standing in his mind he's
[1:40:37] thinking back to what the lord spoke to
[1:40:39] him
[1:40:41] his thoughts he's going but i know that
[1:40:43] was god
[1:40:47] i know it was him it has to be him and
[1:40:51] just like every other christian does
[1:40:52] they start looking at all the evidences
[1:40:54] up from the time god spoke to him
[1:40:56] of all the things the lord has done for
[1:40:57] him since then
[1:40:59] maybe he went back to year 11 when he
[1:41:01] was on his deathbed and said i could
[1:41:02] have died
[1:41:03] they'd give me up that year but here i
[1:41:06] am somehow still going
[1:41:10] all of a sudden now he's growing into a
[1:41:12] place of strength
[1:41:13] glory to god we're not
[1:41:18] out instead of doubting and he starts
[1:41:22] worshiping
[1:41:24] because the bible said he grew strong
[1:41:27] giving praise
[1:41:30] to god brother adam said he watered what
[1:41:33] god had laid down in
[1:41:35] the side of his heart
[1:41:38] [Applause]
[1:41:43] remember the blessing of abraham is
[1:41:45] what's to come to us
[1:41:47] friends if i keep on this trail we ain't
[1:41:51] gonna get
[1:41:52] out of here early let me just let me
[1:41:54] just fast forward to where we need to go
[1:41:57] the fact of the matter is we've been
[1:41:58] sitting in these message churches right
[1:41:59] now for 60 years
[1:42:02] waiting on the rapture waiting on the
[1:42:03] translation waiting on the bride to get
[1:42:05] ready
[1:42:06] how many more sermons do we have to hear
[1:42:08] to know it's time to get ready
[1:42:12] that's what i said the other day i i get
[1:42:14] so tired and i'm not wore
[1:42:15] out with brother brown's name or the
[1:42:16] quotes or the message when i say this i
[1:42:18] get so
[1:42:19] tired of preachers brother branham
[1:42:20] brother brown brother brother brother
[1:42:22] they're saying a lot but they're not
[1:42:23] taking us nowhere
[1:42:26] we need men of god that aren't just
[1:42:28] going to quote it but take me somewhere
[1:42:31] don't just read me the statement take me
[1:42:33] somewhere
[1:42:40] you quote every scripture in the bible
[1:42:42] but if you can't position me
[1:42:43] for where i am right now in 2021 what
[1:42:46] good does it do to quote it
[1:42:48] and we've been hearing these things all
[1:42:50] of our lives
[1:42:51] how many of you kids have been raised on
[1:42:53] a message pew my hands up too
[1:42:55] look at you how far back in your mind
[1:42:58] can you go to all of the times you've
[1:43:00] heard
[1:43:00] the message is going to get the bride
[1:43:02] ready
[1:43:04] well then what in the world are we
[1:43:05] waiting on
[1:43:13] god ain't gonna tell us that part it's
[1:43:15] our business to keep this
[1:43:19] just keep walking
[1:43:23] it's across the bear you know it's
[1:43:26] difficult sometimes when god puts us in
[1:43:28] a position
[1:43:29] to where we just can't see the end
[1:43:30] result
[1:43:32] our churches are getting smaller colder
[1:43:35] creatures are dying left and right these
[1:43:37] old guards are going off the scene left
[1:43:39] and right
[1:43:40] right and there's not a lot of
[1:43:41] replacements coming up
[1:43:44] like it was in the 80s or the 90s where
[1:43:45] you got you got 12 preachers in a church
[1:43:47] at a time
[1:43:49] back in the 80s and the 90s there were
[1:43:50] people all over the field evangelism was
[1:43:52] so high you couldn't have kept off the
[1:43:53] field if you wanted to
[1:43:56] now look at it i can count on one hand
[1:43:58] the preachers that are evangelists
[1:43:59] running around the united states right
[1:44:00] now one hand
[1:44:07] why are we living in this abrahamic age
[1:44:11] what's god doing why are things cooling
[1:44:14] off in such a direction
[1:44:16] listen because god
[1:44:21] wants us to bear this kind of cross
[1:44:27] before the blessing comes
[1:44:32] remember in the last day the ladies were
[1:44:35] to endure
[1:44:36] hardness
[1:44:41] hang on everybody but he called it the
[1:44:44] hardness and the pressure of easy living
[1:44:52] it used to be for some of you older
[1:44:54] christians in here
[1:44:56] it used to be that when you got
[1:44:57] discouraged you go into your prayer
[1:44:59] closet you pray you'd be speaking in
[1:45:00] tongues shouting and hollering crying
[1:45:02] and squalling in a matter of a few
[1:45:03] seconds you come out and everything be
[1:45:04] all right
[1:45:05] now you go get in prayer and it takes
[1:45:06] you or two hours you walk you pray
[1:45:09] your labor you fight you struggle and
[1:45:11] come right out of the closet sometimes
[1:45:12] you know further down the road where he
[1:45:13] was when he went in
[1:45:16] why the spirit of god brother joe is
[1:45:18] lifting up off of the planet
[1:45:21] and all of us are feeling the influence
[1:45:25] because remember the real blessing of
[1:45:27] abraham was this listen
[1:45:30] not that he was a blessed man because he
[1:45:32] was rich not that because he had lots of
[1:45:34] possession
[1:45:35] not because he had great fun
[1:45:38] he was in great lands and great things
[1:45:41] but the real
[1:45:42] blessing of abraham was
[1:45:45] he could wait for god to do what god
[1:45:49] promised he was going to do
[1:45:55] brother brown said the reason eve got in
[1:45:57] trouble is because she couldn't wait
[1:46:02] i counsel young people and i counsel
[1:46:04] older people the same way all the time
[1:46:06] some of these
[1:46:07] cases that get in a situation and they
[1:46:09] can't hardly wait to get married
[1:46:12] i tell them wait it out pray about it
[1:46:15] study about it make sure you're making
[1:46:16] the right decisions
[1:46:19] don't just jump into things i talked to
[1:46:21] an individual here the other day in the
[1:46:22] 60s
[1:46:25] three or four living wives
[1:46:28] oh i just i just can't live alone i said
[1:46:30] yeah that's the problem you had that
[1:46:32] that weight problem
[1:46:34] not w-e-i-g-h-t but that w-a-i-t we got
[1:46:38] a lot of weight problems in the message
[1:46:47] the real character of the bride of jesus
[1:46:49] christ
[1:46:50] in the real hallmark of who she is is
[1:46:52] going to be the fact that she knows
[1:46:55] how to wait on the lord
[1:47:01] god had took this man and pulled him off
[1:47:04] to the side of the road and took him to
[1:47:05] a parking lot
[1:47:07] and parked him for 25 years
[1:47:13] what would that do to many of you if you
[1:47:16] knew that the coming of the lord was
[1:47:18] 60 years from now
[1:47:21] how would you live how would it change
[1:47:25] your attitude
[1:47:26] how would you behave
[1:47:33] that's one reason bill graham said god
[1:47:34] don't tell us
[1:47:36] because us gentiles were so lazy he said
[1:47:38] and i'm quoting
[1:47:40] he said we wait till the last minute to
[1:47:41] get ready
[1:47:43] so he just keeps it hanging in space
[1:47:48] some of y'all are looking at me
[1:47:50] [Laughter]
[1:47:54] back home i always knew when i had them
[1:47:55] they got quiet you all have an
[1:47:56] expression
[1:48:00] at least you got that much
[1:48:05] but you see the most difficult thing for
[1:48:07] any child of god
[1:48:08] is to hear the lord say i'm going to do
[1:48:10] this for you
[1:48:13] and never tell you
[1:48:17] and then you just sit okay
[1:48:22] so what am i supposed to do in the
[1:48:23] meantime the lord spoke to me
[1:48:25] a number of years ago nearly 20 years
[1:48:27] ago
[1:48:28] i was driving up the road and the holy
[1:48:30] spirit told me to be weary which is
[1:48:32] w-a-r-y or cautious and strengthen
[1:48:34] myself
[1:48:37] okay so i did that
[1:48:42] 20 years later i've been asking the lord
[1:48:43] okay what next
[1:48:45] but you see that's the key he hasn't
[1:48:47] given a new order so you just continue
[1:48:50] practicing the ones that give
[1:48:53] be cautious and strengthen yourself well
[1:48:56] you need to be
[1:48:57] because along about that time by the way
[1:49:01] was about the same time that some of the
[1:49:03] people i would sit in the back room with
[1:49:04] were
[1:49:05] days from leaving the message
[1:49:08] when i would go into the room and they'd
[1:49:09] call me aside to speak to me one such
[1:49:12] man down in alabama that was one of the
[1:49:13] first ones to leave the message had
[1:49:15] called me to the side
[1:49:16] sat me down and i was talking to him
[1:49:18] like a buddy and the holy spirit brought
[1:49:20] his word
[1:49:20] back to me be weary strengthen your self
[1:49:23] caution
[1:49:25] we didn't know that people are going to
[1:49:26] pack up and move out of here in droves
[1:49:29] we didn't realize people were gonna quit
[1:49:31] the truth about about 10 or 15 years ago
[1:49:33] like they have
[1:49:36] you think but what's going on they
[1:49:38] couldn't wait any longer
[1:49:44] the real test of our character
[1:49:48] is gonna come down to this one thing
[1:49:52] can you wait it out
[1:50:03] let's power heads
[1:50:11] while you're sitting there tonight
[1:50:12] thanking
[1:50:15] and you that are streaming online
[1:50:17] tonight
[1:50:21] i want you to consider the words that
[1:50:22] the lords give to us tonight because
[1:50:24] this was certainly not planned
[1:50:33] remember it's not he that begins the
[1:50:35] race it's he that finishes
[1:50:39] endurance
[1:50:42] stamina grit as they call it that's what
[1:50:46] gets a man or woman through a race
[1:50:50] burst of speed being able to run fast
[1:50:54] that only works in short little spurts
[1:50:55] of stunting and things like that but
[1:50:57] when you are in a marathon
[1:51:00] how fast you run don't matter it's
[1:51:03] whether or not you can make it all the
[1:51:05] way to the end of the thing
[1:51:08] friends i want you to consider in your
[1:51:10] heart tonight
[1:51:13] look at your life and study your your
[1:51:15] moves
[1:51:16] look at the areas of your life you're
[1:51:18] suffering in right now is the result of
[1:51:20] it because
[1:51:22] you've moved too quickly because you've
[1:51:26] pressed
[1:51:27] pushed beyond the will of god
[1:51:31] look at the areas that you're struggling
[1:51:33] in tonight
[1:51:35] look and just see if it isn't that very
[1:51:37] thing
[1:51:38] that might be hindering you even right
[1:51:40] now look at your prayer life when you go
[1:51:42] to pray
[1:51:44] are you patient do you wait on the lord
[1:51:46] when you ask him for something do you
[1:51:47] sit back and say okay lord i'm just
[1:51:48] going to wait on you now
[1:51:51] look at the way that you think about his
[1:51:54] word that's the way you think about even
[1:51:56] church like this tonight
[1:51:59] we're in such a hurry that you know and
[1:52:01] i i tried on these evening services like
[1:52:03] this midweek i try to be very mindful of
[1:52:05] the time
[1:52:06] i really do honestly i do but friends i
[1:52:09] also realize that when the holy spirit
[1:52:11] goes to speaking to us like he is right
[1:52:12] now
[1:52:14] we should take the time to be able to
[1:52:15] stop and listen to him see what he has
[1:52:16] to say
[1:52:18] in fact the matter is many of us gonna
[1:52:20] stand outside and talk for 20 minutes
[1:52:21] anyways
[1:52:23] why can't we give god extra time why
[1:52:24] can't we give it to him why
[1:52:26] because like with everything else in our
[1:52:28] life we're in a breakneck speed hurry
[1:52:32] jumping from one thing to another to
[1:52:34] another to another to another
[1:52:40] examine your heart tonight and you don't
[1:52:43] have to say to me or nobody else but
[1:52:45] just tell the lord lord
[1:52:46] i realize one reason but i'm not where i
[1:52:49] should be
[1:52:50] i just because i just haven't been
[1:52:51] waiting on you like i should
[1:52:56] there is strength in waiting did you
[1:52:58] know it's scriptural
[1:53:00] sometimes not to move
[1:53:04] paul said when you've done everything
[1:53:05] you can to stand just stand
[1:53:09] we preach in such a way god moving the
[1:53:11] holy spirit moving
[1:53:12] we want god to move yes but sometimes
[1:53:16] god wants us to stand still too
[1:53:20] told moses stand still see the salvation
[1:53:23] of the lord
[1:53:24] examine your heart tonight many of the
[1:53:26] bad decisions you've ever made in your
[1:53:27] life
[1:53:28] it's been made because you did it in
[1:53:29] haste because you didn't wait on god for
[1:53:32] the right season the right time
[1:53:38] now you forgive me for my little comment
[1:53:39] about the left and right
[1:53:42] and i have offended you while you're
[1:53:44] praying there don't let things like that
[1:53:45] hinder you
[1:53:46] i was only trying to make a little funny
[1:53:48] just try lightening the mood a little
[1:53:49] bit
[1:53:52] but think in your heart tonight lord
[1:53:55] jesus
[1:53:59] the area i get discouraged in the thing
[1:54:00] that i feel like you
[1:54:02] do you understand that's one thing that
[1:54:03] makes us feel like god don't love us
[1:54:07] because when he doesn't move at our
[1:54:09] speed
[1:54:11] we feel like some has been mean to us
[1:54:15] look at that part of your life patience
[1:54:17] the waiting
[1:54:18] in your patience possessions
[1:54:22] i want to pray for you tonight and you
[1:54:23] pray for me
[1:54:25] lord jesus in this atmosphere tonight
[1:54:29] where father you have completely taken
[1:54:31] over the message
[1:54:33] i can't say you hijacked the message but
[1:54:34] lord
[1:54:37] that's what we asked you to do is come
[1:54:38] and speak it's what you've done
[1:54:41] in a completely different direction than
[1:54:42] what i anticipated
[1:54:44] but father's for a purpose
[1:54:48] we're asking that your holy spirit will
[1:54:50] come into this place tonight and you
[1:54:51] will deal with every heart
[1:54:53] examine every heart and every life
[1:54:56] and deal with us lord help us in these
[1:55:00] areas
[1:55:02] to wait on you to be patient
[1:55:05] i remember many years ago lord i got
[1:55:07] myself into a little bit of a
[1:55:09] of a bad situation money-wise i'd done
[1:55:12] made some decisions financially and i
[1:55:14] got a few little credit cards and debts
[1:55:16] when i was just
[1:55:17] barely 19 20 lord you
[1:55:20] you know and how i spoke to you and
[1:55:23] cried out
[1:55:24] working my fingers to the bone trying to
[1:55:26] get them paid off and you spoke to me
[1:55:28] that time and said what are you in such
[1:55:29] a hurry for
[1:55:33] because you were going to provide for me
[1:55:34] you were going to help me take care of
[1:55:35] it
[1:55:36] the things i bought wasn't frivolous it
[1:55:38] just i should have waited a little
[1:55:39] longer before i made the decision to do
[1:55:41] it there were good things
[1:55:42] stuff i needed and you said to me
[1:55:45] what are you in such a hurry for lord
[1:55:49] i don't know about these people but i
[1:55:50] can certainly testify
[1:55:52] many of the boo-boos as brother graham
[1:55:54] called them that i've made in my life
[1:55:56] that come from not being patient
[1:56:00] so lord i pray you'll help me and help
[1:56:02] them
[1:56:04] help us lord to wait upon your presence
[1:56:08] and whatever area this may affect us
[1:56:10] tonight
[1:56:12] help us to wait develop this part of our
[1:56:15] life lord
[1:56:17] that we can wait in jesus name
[1:56:22] amen
[1:56:25] praise the lord thank you jesus thank
[1:56:29] you jesus
[1:56:32] how many here just feel like the lord
[1:56:33] has spoken to him will you raise your
[1:56:34] hands up to the lord
[1:56:36] you just feel like the lord has spoken
[1:56:37] to you tonight
[1:56:39] you just raise your hands up and say god
[1:56:42] i just want to commit to you lord a new
[1:56:45] outlook a new feeling in my heart
[1:56:49] a new direction of looking at things and
[1:56:53] from here tonight
[1:56:54] moving forward i want to be different i

[1:58:39] leather and all that or you can go to a
[1:58:40] restaurant and sit and wait for 45
[1:58:41] minutes to an hour for him to cook you a
[1:58:43] good one
[1:58:44] the better comes after the waiting god

[1:59:30] i walked out of there and i said
[1:59:33] my god don't do halfway stuff
[1:59:37] and just a few wednesdays ago i come out
[1:59:39] of the doctor's office
[1:59:41] they didn't even put in an injection or
[1:59:42] nothing in my eye
[1:59:44] they dilated the eye they looked in the
[1:59:45] eyeball and i've got a picture right
