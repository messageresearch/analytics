[16:48] Say amen when you got it.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[16:54] In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw
[16:58] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[17:01] and lifted up, and his train filled the
[17:04] temple.
[17:16] And one cried unto another and said,
[17:19] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[17:23] The whole earth is full of his glory.
[17:36] me, for I am undone, because I am a man
[17:39] of unclean lips, and I dwell in the
[17:42] midst of a people of unclean lips. For
[17:45] mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord
[17:48] of Hosts.
[17:59] And he laid it upon my mouth and said,
[18:02] "Lo, this hath touched my thy lips, and
[18:06] thine iniquity is taken away, and thy
[18:09] sin purged.
[18:21] And he said, "Go and tell this people,
[18:24] hear ye indeed, but understand not, and
[18:28] see ye indeed, but perceive not.
[18:45] Then said I, Lord, how long? And he
[18:48] answered, until the cities be wasted
[18:51] without inhabitant, and the houses
[18:54] without man, and the land be utterly
[18:56] desolate.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; This one together. But yet in it shall
[19:07] be a tenth, and it shall return, and it
[19:10] shall be eaten as a tile tree, and as an
[19:14] oak, whose substance is in them. When
[19:16] they cast their leaves, so the holy seed
[19:19] shall be the substance thereof. Amen.
[19:22] God bless you.

[19:29] heart. Amen. Let's sing that little

[33:36] I know
[33:39] how he feels this morning because my dad
[33:42] had dementia and his dad is not doing
[33:45] very well. And and uh I told him we'd
[33:48] pray for him and I've been praying for
[33:49] his dad and I told him that we'd pray
[33:51] for him. And if you've never dealt with

[33:56] person. I'll just tell you.
[33:58] Uh my mother passed away with cancer and
[34:01] I don't think it was as bad as what dad

[34:42] pretty good, but she had a lot of fluid
[34:44] on her heart and they've gave her some
[34:46] medicine and her kidneys are not doing
[34:49] well. And and he he said she needs a
[34:52] touch from the Lord. He said if she gets
[34:53] up and does much of anything, uh he said
[34:57] she's just out of breath, which sister
[34:58] Peggy's been on oxygen for quite some
[35:01] time. But just pray that God will touch
[35:03] her body and they're going to move her
[35:05] to Morganfield. and when we find out
[35:09] when they move her and where she's at,
[35:10] we'll let the church know. But they
[35:13] desire your prayers and and just pray
[35:16] that God will just touch her body this

[39:25] Amen. You love him. This morning we're
[39:27] going to invite brother Chris out. Him
[39:29] and his family are going to sing this
[39:30] morning. So as we ask brother Chris to
[39:32] come, let's sing out little chorus.
[39:34] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[39:42] is and save the rich.
[39:46] Oh my. Oh, it's a thing
[39:51] is in grace.
[39:53] Oh, how sweet
[39:57] the sound
[40:00] that save
[40:02] a rich
[40:05] like me. Oh yes, Lord.
[40:10] I once
[40:13] was lost,
[40:16] but now
[40:18] I'm found.
[40:21] I was blind,
[40:24] but now
[40:26] I see.
[40:29] It was grace.
[40:31] It was grace
[40:34] that taught
[40:37] my heart
[40:40] to fear
[40:42] and grace
[40:45] my fear.
[40:52] How preciously
[40:58] the grace
[41:00] appear.

[41:08] beun
[41:11] through many dangers and through many
[41:16] day
[41:19] stoes
[41:24] I bless you my friend.
[41:34] It was grace
[41:37] that brought
[41:39] me safe
[41:42] the small
[41:45] and grace
[41:47] will lead
[41:50] me home. Let's sing praise God. Oh,

[42:45] worthy of our praise. No matter you just
[42:48] woke up this morning, we should all be
[42:50] saying, "God, thank you for giving me
[42:51] breath in my body just to give another
[42:54] day to the Lord. Not just on Sunday, not
[42:57] just on Wednesday, but every single day
[42:59] I wake up, I just I want to share Jesus.
[43:02] I mean, I, you know, I feel like you
[43:04] getting the message and it's like I want
[43:06] to keep it in a box. Well, I don't want
[43:08] to. I want to share it with the world.
[43:10] I, you know, uh, Brother Bam says stay
[43:12] with your ABCs. So, I'll stay with my
[43:13] ABCs and if if let bring in the fish and
[43:16] the lizards and let God do the increase.

[43:36] the name of Jesus Christ and brother
[43:38] Larry Harris says hello back in uh back
[43:41] at home. It's only a two-hour drive for
[43:43] us now so it's not far for us to drive.
[43:45] So God bless you. You may be seated. I
[43:47] think the boys and Rachel have a song
[43:50] this morning. I just pray it blesses you
[43:52] this morning and just worship him with
[43:54] the Lord if you don't mind. Uh let's
[43:56] just worship God. You didn't come to
[43:58] hear me. You come to hear from God
[43:59] today. And uh just pray for me. Just

[47:41] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful this morning? We
[47:44] come into his house to worship him
[47:46] today. But I just want to worship him
[47:48] every day of my life. I just thank thank
[47:52] him for the goodness of God. I was just
[47:55] thinking about this this lyrics this
[47:57] morning.
[47:59] this this song that goes, "All my life
[48:03] you have been faithful."
[48:06] Oh, let's just sing it to him. Think
[48:08] about your life. All my life you have
[48:12] been so so good.
[48:17] With every breath that I am able,
[48:23] I will sing of the goodness
[48:29] Oh, sing it to him again from your
[48:31] heart.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, you have, Lord.
[48:41] And all my life you have been so so
[48:46] good.
[48:49] Every breath that I have made,
[48:55] &gt;&gt; I will sing.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing it once more for me. Make
[49:00] it your prayer this morning.
[49:05] All my life you have been faithful.
[49:13] All my life you have been so so good.
[49:21] Every breath that I
[49:27] &gt;&gt; will sing of the goodness
[49:32] of God.
[49:34] Oh, is that your prayer? Father, we love
[49:37] you,
[49:38] God. All my life you've been faithful.
[49:42] Times I didn't see her. I didn't see. I
[49:45] didn't feel you. Lord, I might have been
[49:46] a million miles in a gutter, but God,
[49:49] you are still along being faithful,
[49:51] watching over us. Lord, God, we're
[49:54] thankful today to serve you, not just a
[49:57] million other gods, but thee, Lord Jesus
[50:00] Christ. God, we're thankful that we have
[50:03] the revelation in our day. Our eyes have
[50:06] been open. The eyes haven't been
[50:08] applied. God, may you meet us today.
[50:11] Your word says you and two or three are
[50:13] gathered. You're in the midst. your word
[50:15] doesn't return void. God, I ask you come
[50:18] through every aisle. Father, help me get
[50:20] out of the way, Lord, that these lips
[50:22] would just be used for you and for what
[50:25] you'd want to have to say today. God, we
[50:28] study all night, but God, you would
[50:30] direct us and guide us in every aisle,
[50:33] every heart. We want to hear from you
[50:34] today, Lord. We love you. We dedicate
[50:37] this service. May you just look and may
[50:40] your angels encamp around us, Lord. When
[50:42] we talk about you, when we read your
[50:44] word, it's a promise that you come here.
[50:47] God, we love you, Father. We give you
[50:49] this service. Bless your people. Bless
[50:51] brother Ber, his faithfulness. Lord, I
[50:54] ask you bless him abundantly. Father, in
[50:57] Jesus Christ's name, we give you this
[50:59] service in Jesus name. And all people
[51:01] say,
[51:02] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[51:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Let's just
[51:05] turn to him. God bless you musicians and
[51:08] we just love you this morning. Let's
[51:10] just turn to Corinthians this morning.
[51:12] First Corinthians chapter 15. First
[51:15] Corinthians chapter 15. We're going to
[51:18] go to verse 50.
[51:24] 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[51:28] I'll try to not eat too much later where
[51:30] I can keep y'all awake.
[51:32] But uh but let's just eat on the word
[51:34] while we can today. That's what that's
[51:37] what we came here for. So 1 Corinthians
[51:40] uh 15 verse 50 it says here in verse 50
[51:45] it says now this this I say brethren
[51:48] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[51:51] kingdom of God. It says neither do
[51:54] corruption inherit corruption. And it
[51:57] goes on to say verse 51 behold I show I
[52:02] show you a mystery. He says, "We shall
[52:05] not all sleep, but we shall all be
[52:08] changed." Aren't you thankful today that
[52:11] there was many graveyards I passed
[52:13] today, but not everybody's dead in that
[52:15] graveyard?
[52:17] &gt;&gt; There's some Christians that's held on
[52:19] to the torch of faith and has fought the
[52:22] good fight of faith. And there, Brother
[52:23] Ram says, Christians don't die. Aren't
[52:26] you thankful? The Bible doesn't even say
[52:28] that Christians die. Aren't you
[52:29] thankful? If you've had a loved one pass
[52:31] away, they're not dead. But Ram said
[52:33] he's more alive then when he passed away
[52:35] than he was here. So hey, I'm just here
[52:38] to tell you that's the word of God. So
[52:40] it says, "We shall not sleep. We shall
[52:42] not all be changed." Verse 52, "In a
[52:45] moment, in a twinkling of an eye at the
[52:48] last trumpet, for the trumpet shall
[52:52] sound in the dead and shall be r raised
[52:55] incorruptible and shall be changed."
[52:57] Aren't you thankful for the promise
[52:59] today? No matter if you got by the grave
[53:01] or if I die in a car accident, I still
[53:04] will come up and and and and have a new
[53:07] body. Aren't you thankful? It goes on to
[53:09] say verse 53, for this incorruptible in
[53:13] this corruptible must put on
[53:14] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[53:17] on immortality.
[53:19] Verse 55, oh death, where is thy sting?
[53:23] Oh grave, where is thy victory? Aren't
[53:26] you thankful that that there's no more
[53:28] sting and death? Jesus Christ took the
[53:31] sting at Calvary. Aren't you thankful
[53:34] today that you woke up and you have a
[53:36] purpose this morning that he took the
[53:38] sting of death. If you, you know, you
[53:40] get around wasp or whatever, they bite
[53:43] you and they leave the stinger in you
[53:44] and they die. But I tell you, Jesus
[53:46] Christ paid the ultimate price for
[53:48] everything. And that's why you're here
[53:50] today. It never gets old. The gospel
[53:53] never gets old. I tell you, the more you
[53:55] study it, the more you listen to the
[53:57] tapes, it just an overflowing well on
[54:00] the inside. And the prophet of God says,
[54:02] "The more you pump the water, the more
[54:04] you get out of it." So, I just want to
[54:06] keep pumping water today. He says, "The
[54:09] sting of death is sin, and this and the
[54:11] strength of sin is the law." And I just
[54:14] want to focus this morning. This thought
[54:16] came to me. Maybe it's simple, but I
[54:17] like it. He says, "But thanks be to God
[54:21] which giveth us the victory through our
[54:23] Lord Jesus Christ." Aren't you thankful?
[54:26] Thanks be to God. I think we can all say
[54:28] that today that thanks be to God. He's
[54:30] gave us victory not by you, not by your
[54:33] works, not by what you could bring to
[54:35] God today, but by Jesus Christ alone is
[54:39] your victory.
[54:40] But verse 58 says, "Therefore, my
[54:42] beloved brethren, be ye steadfast."
[54:46] Let's let's read this together.
[54:48] Unmovable,
[54:50] always abounding in the work of the
[54:53] Lord. For as much as ye know that your
[54:56] labor is not in vain in the Lord. May
[54:59] you may be seated. I just want to focus
[55:02] on this word at the last sentence. It
[55:04] says, "For your lab, your labor is not
[55:06] in vain."
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Your labor is not If I could title it
[55:10] this morning, your labor is not in vain.
[55:14] Maybe you feel like I've been around
[55:16] this mountain. Maybe you feel like,
[55:18] "Hey, when I get on the road this
[55:19] morning, I'll just be honest with you. I
[55:21] was tired in my body. I The Lord said,
[55:23] "But your labor is not in vain. If it's
[55:26] just for one person this morning, it's
[55:28] worth it all. If it's just for me,
[55:30] praise God." But I'm here to tell you
[55:32] when you when you're in this message or
[55:34] you believe the word of God, it says he
[55:36] says in verse 30 58, be steadfast,
[55:40] unmovable, always abounding in the work
[55:45] of the Lord. It doesn't say to sit back
[55:46] and relax in the work of the Lord. It's
[55:49] always abounding. Always about my
[55:52] father's business. We should just not be
[55:55] sitting back and cruise control this
[55:57] morning. I I've traveled the world. I
[55:59] traveled them. I've been to Ecuador last
[56:01] year. I've traveled I've traveled
[56:03] overseas. I've traveled from state to
[56:05] state. And I'm here to tell you, we've
[56:07] gotten to a place I feel like a
[56:09] complacency in our lives where we we
[56:12] just believe a message. But I'm here to
[56:14] tell you, it's more than just believing
[56:16] a message.
[56:18] It's more than just quoting a quote
[56:20] book. It's more than just tolding to
[56:22] know all the quotes. BUT DO YOU KNOW THE
[56:24] AUTHOR TODAY? Do you know where he's
[56:27] brought you from? Do you know he's a
[56:29] living on the inside and you are written
[56:32] epistles read of all men.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; You are written epistles READ OF ALL MEN
[56:37] on your jobs or wherever you're at.
[56:39] Everybody's looking at you every day.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; They can care if you know the whole
[56:45] Bible or know the book. They want to
[56:46] know what's on the inside.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; That's like the prophet says, when the
[56:50] weakest Christian gets on their knees,
[56:52] the devil trembles. Can you imagine us
[56:55] if you're a prayed up Christian that
[56:57] knows God that really has a life
[56:59] consecrated before God? What the devil
[57:02] does? Does the whole thing have a
[57:03] earthquake every time you get on your
[57:05] knees? Does he not just tremble? But I
[57:08] thought about a prayed up person in
[57:09] Jesus Christ.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; But I thought about a steadfast,
[57:14] unmovable, always abounding. He didn't
[57:16] say just sit back. He said always
[57:18] abounding in the work of the Lord. Just
[57:21] because you come into a message doesn't
[57:23] mean I'm Brother Chris, I'm good now.
[57:25] I'm just going to sit back, Brother Ber.
[57:27] I'm just going to relax. I'm going to
[57:29] let the preacher tell me a quote on
[57:31] Sunday. I'm going to let the let brother
[57:33] Ber spend all day on a Saturday and
[57:35] study and Friday and through the week
[57:37] just to come in here to hear the
[57:39] message. You should be hearing the
[57:40] message Monday through Friday and
[57:42] Saturday and Sunday. Not just on Sunday
[57:46] today.
[57:47] This should be an every day. Not just
[57:49] for the preacher but for the leoty
[57:51] alike. We should all COME IN THIS PLACE
[57:54] saying I've come to expect from you
[57:56] Lord. I come to be changed. I come to be
[58:00] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[58:00] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[58:00] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[58:00] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[58:00] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[58:00] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[58:00] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[58:00] be be be be be be be be be be be re be
[58:00] re be re reborn. I be come to be
[58:02] refilled today. I become to get
[58:04] something from you Lord. An expectation
[58:08] is what we should come in here. NOT JUST
[58:10] ANOTHER SERVICE, NOT JUST ANOTHER SUNDAY
[58:13] SERVICE. But hey, this is for me, Lord.
[58:16] Not just to be sitting back, but to be
[58:18] standfast, unmovable,
[58:21] always abounding,
[58:23] &gt;&gt; always abounding. And I just brought
[58:25] that title out, your labor is not in
[58:27] vain. Because I believe there's a lot of
[58:29] things you can do in vain. I believe you
[58:32] can work too much, you can do that.
[58:33] Rebraham said, you can't pray enough.
[58:35] You can't pray too much. You can do
[58:37] this. You can do that. But I'm here to
[58:39] tell you, living this message, living
[58:41] the truth, young people, it's not in
[58:43] vain.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. And I thought last
[58:46] night late into the hour about 2:00, I
[58:49] thought about Sister Hattie Wright
[58:51] because Sister Hattie Wright one time
[58:53] she said, "That's nothing but the
[58:55] truth." And he said, "What? I can give
[58:57] whatever you ask the Lord." She said, "I
[58:59] want the salvation on both boys."
[59:02] It wasn't in vain that when she heard
[59:04] the word, she agreed to it. And what you
[59:07] are agreeing to could change your
[59:09] destination today. Just by you saying
[59:12] amen to the word. Could change your
[59:15] destination. Could change your
[59:17] grandchildren. Could change your your
[59:18] your home today.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. First Corinthians,
[59:26] I was reading that, but I want to read
[59:28] another translation in verse 15, verse
[59:30] 58. He says in this translation, "So
[59:33] now, beloved ones, stand firm, stable,
[59:37] enduring.
[59:39] Live your lives with unshakable
[59:41] confidence."
[59:43] It says, "We know that we prosper and
[59:45] excel in every season by serving the
[59:48] Lord because we are assured that our
[59:51] union with the Lord makes our labor
[59:54] productive with fruit that endures."
[59:58] I'm talking about a a a tree that puts
[1:00:00] off fruit. You he we are the branches.
[1:00:03] He's the vine. Are you just sitting
[1:00:05] there today? Are you just sitting there
[1:00:08] saying, "Well, I'm just a tree. I'm not
[1:00:09] going to produce ANY FRUIT." GOD'S
[1:00:11] CALLED YOU out of this world. But you
[1:00:14] got to live in this world. But I'm here
[1:00:16] to produce some fruit today. And I tell
[1:00:19] you, it will take the reading of God's
[1:00:21] word every single day. And I'm praying
[1:00:24] that not saying that you won't have
[1:00:25] trials. That's when the trials come. I
[1:00:29] got a lot of trials, but I got a God
[1:00:31] that's bigger than every single trial.
[1:00:33] Every trial you're going through. Our
[1:00:35] God is still faithful.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; He is still a good God.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I wrote that down. I was looking up the
[1:00:43] definition of steadfast. I'm just going
[1:00:44] to break this down for you today. I hope
[1:00:46] this is okay. This is the definition of
[1:00:48] steadfast. I wrote this down. It I
[1:00:50] looked this up. It said steadfast. It's
[1:00:53] firm. It's fixed. It's unwavering,
[1:00:56] dependable,
[1:00:58] consistently, and faithful.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. Firm, fixed,
[1:01:03] unwavering, dependable, consistently
[1:01:06] faithful. I tell you, that's I pray God.
[1:01:09] I said, Lord, let me be that.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Let me be firm, fixed, unwavering,
[1:01:14] dependable.
[1:01:15] Goes on to say, I was reading this. It
[1:01:17] says steadfast means to remain spiritual
[1:01:20] strong. Spiritually strong, firmly
[1:01:23] planted and committed no matter what
[1:01:26] pressure,
[1:01:27] distraction
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; or difficulty that comes.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Think about that today. No matter what
[1:01:34] pressure, no matter what distraction or
[1:01:38] def difficulty comes, think about that.
[1:01:41] Being steadfast.
[1:01:43] Just because someone leaves here or
[1:01:45] leaves the message or does this, you be
[1:01:47] steadfast,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; unmovable, unshakable.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay. And I wrote this
[1:01:54] down. Firm and stable. And you're not
[1:01:57] easily to be shaken or moved. You have a
[1:02:00] you have a solid purpose.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; You have a you know your purpose here. I
[1:02:05] tell you, I I believe every one of us
[1:02:07] should figure out your purpose. Let the
[1:02:10] Lord show you your purpose in life. IF
[1:02:12] YOU'RE A HOUSEWIFE, BE THE BEST
[1:02:14] HOUSEWIFE. If you're the Sunday school
[1:02:16] teacher, be the best Sunday school
[1:02:18] teacher. If you're a businessman, be the
[1:02:20] best businessman.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; This world need Jesus.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; This world needs to see a little light
[1:02:27] of Jesus. Not just all camped into a
[1:02:30] building, but to be the hands and feet
[1:02:32] of Jesus out there.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; People want to see it. I was I was at a
[1:02:37] concert the other night the the night
[1:02:39] and the other night and I thought this
[1:02:41] one this guy looks at us he goes do I
[1:02:43] know you do I know you and I thought wow
[1:02:46] you know you just get around somebody we
[1:02:48] went through what a hundred people and
[1:02:50] all of a sudden he's like do we know you
[1:02:51] yeah we're we're all sons and daughters
[1:02:53] of a king
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; there's a tenur spirit and I thought
[1:02:58] that's how we should be put off some
[1:03:00] KIND OF OIL LIKE a dove on the inside
[1:03:03] that comes radiating when you get around
[1:03:06] somebody, they go, "Do I know you? GOD,
[1:03:09] I FEEL LIKE I'VE known you before.
[1:03:11] I
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; I just feel there's a presence around
[1:03:14] you. I FEEL LIKE I know you."
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Young people, THIS IS NOT JUST FOR YOUR
[1:03:19] PARENTS. This is for you, too.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; It's a walk with God alone.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; The problem God is a mystic. You're a
[1:03:27] mystic to the world. It's a walk. It's
[1:03:31] I'm going to tell you, it sometimes
[1:03:32] becomes a lonely walk. Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; It's not an easy walk,
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; but it's a WORTHY WALK. IT'S A worthy
[1:03:39] calling.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; It's the best calling you could get
[1:03:43] today. You're You could get a call, my
[1:03:45] brother said, the president and be like,
[1:03:47] "OH MY GOSH, TRUMP, CAN Y'ALL BELIEVE
[1:03:49] Trump called me?"
[1:03:53] You could literally call, YOU WOULD CALL
[1:03:55] EVERYBODY. YOU'D have Brother Ber,
[1:03:57] they'd have Facebook blown up.
[1:04:00] Come here, Trump. Let me put my arm
[1:04:02] around you. But you know what? Know
[1:04:04] something greater than that? Jesus
[1:04:06] Christ has stepped for glory. AND HE'S
[1:04:10] CALLED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU BY NAME.
[1:04:14] And he's GAVE YOU A PURPOSE TO KEEP
[1:04:16] PRESSING ON. When trials seem tough,
[1:04:19] WHEN LIFE SEEMS TOUGH, when you think
[1:04:21] you ain't going TO MAKE IT, KNOW THAT
[1:04:23] YOU'RE SONS and daughters of the king.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; You've been called. You've been
[1:04:30] baptized. You took on his name.
[1:04:34] I'm speaking to bride today and I'm here
[1:04:36] to tell you if you haven't got that
[1:04:38] experience on the inside, I provoke you
[1:04:40] today before the end of the service to
[1:04:43] meet Jesus Christ,
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; to meet the author. Get an axe
[1:04:47] experience WITH GOD. YOUNG PEOPLE,
[1:04:50] THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO HOLD YOU IN THIS
[1:04:52] DARK WORLD.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; NOTHING ELSE WILL HOLD YOU. I CAN'T HOLD
[1:04:56] YOU. YOUR PARENTS CAN'T HOLD YOU. But
[1:04:58] Jesus Christ can hold you.
[1:05:01] They can hold you along the way.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; I wrote another word down. Be consistent
[1:05:07] and cons uh constant faithful every day.
[1:05:11] Not just on good days,
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; but every day.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; On every day, be steadfast. You I'm
[1:05:19] telling you, it's like it is literally
[1:05:20] life is like a roller coaster. One day
[1:05:23] you're up, one day you're down. One day
[1:05:25] you're up. If you live off OF THAT DAY,
[1:05:27] I tell you what, we'd be some miserable
[1:05:28] people today.
[1:05:31] But aren't you glad that God sent a
[1:05:34] prophet in the land and has opened the
[1:05:37] book, opened the seals, and if Paul
[1:05:40] COULD COME BACK IN THIS DAY, he'd want
[1:05:42] to be in this day.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; But he chose you in THE DARKEST HOUR,
[1:05:46] KNOW. YOU MIGHT SEE a little bit of
[1:05:48] light, but there's barely any light
[1:05:50] left.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking to every one of you
[1:05:53] today that you're a light to this world.
[1:05:56] BE A LIGHT IN THIS DARK WORLD. BE
[1:05:58] STEADFAST. BE UNMOVABLE,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; always abounding.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Not just sit back and say, "Well, uh,
[1:06:07] God gave me the message. I'm going to go
[1:06:08] in the corner and hide and believe it."
[1:06:10] No. Shed a light. SHOW EVERYBODY. SHARE
[1:06:14] YOUR ABCS. Always believe Christ.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; That's how I got. Someone handed me a
[1:06:20] tape book, a book one day and said,
[1:06:21] "Hey, here here's Jezebel religion. Why
[1:06:24] you're nomination?"
[1:06:25] None of my family believed it. But there
[1:06:28] was that seed on the inside. There was
[1:06:30] that from the foundation of the world.
[1:06:33] They handed me a book from someone in
[1:06:35] the world just said a Christian came out
[1:06:38] of church and handed me a book
[1:06:40] and said, "Hey, read this. Listen to
[1:06:43] this. It changed my life 22 years ago.
[1:06:46] I'm here to tell you today I'm going to
[1:06:49] be unmovable, unshaken. I don't care IF
[1:06:51] EVERYBODY LEAVES. I'M STILL STANDING.
[1:06:56] You got to get an unmovroable,
[1:06:58] unshakable life. Always abounding. I
[1:07:02] wrote this down. Always be determined.
[1:07:04] Having your mind made up, young people,
[1:07:06] to follow God regardless of your
[1:07:09] feelings or circumstances.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Regardless of your feelings or
[1:07:14] circumstances,
[1:07:15] be loyal, unwavering, standing strong in
[1:07:18] faith, the truth, and obedience.
[1:07:23] Just some things I wrote down. Steadfast
[1:07:25] means staying planted. Another place
[1:07:28] said staying faithful, staying focused.
[1:07:31] Who wants to be focused today? Say,
[1:07:33] Lord, I want to be planted no matter
[1:07:35] what comes.
[1:07:37] Unmovable. I looked that word up. There
[1:07:40] was so much in that one scripture. It
[1:07:42] says unmovable.
[1:07:44] uh unable to be to be pushed off course,
[1:07:49] shaken or shifted away from the truth of
[1:07:51] God's word. That's what I want today.
[1:07:55] Unable to be pushed off course,
[1:07:57] unmovable. It goes on to say, it
[1:07:59] describes someone spiritually anchored,
[1:08:01] refuses to be swayed by circumstances,
[1:08:05] opinions.
[1:08:07] Oh, I'm tell you today, there's a lot of
[1:08:09] opinions in this message.
[1:08:11] There's a lot of people will tell you,
[1:08:13] "Well, this and THAT AND THAT." I DON'T
[1:08:14] WANT IF IT AIN'T IN THE WORD OF GOD, I
[1:08:16] DON'T want your opinion.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't line back up from Genesis
[1:08:21] to Revelation, young people, then stay
[1:08:23] away from it.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Opinions, don't be swayed by
[1:08:28] circumstances, opinions, pressure, or
[1:08:32] attacks of the enemy.
[1:08:35] Oh my. Firmly rooted. I wrote this down.
[1:08:38] We're firmly rooted in God's truth.
[1:08:40] Don't bend when the culture changes.
[1:08:44] Emotions shift or people disagree.
[1:08:47] Oh, I hope this is okay.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; You stand on what God said. No matter
[1:08:52] WHAT YOU SEE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE,
[1:08:55] YOUNG PEOPLE, NO MATTER WHAT AGE YOU
[1:08:57] ARE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE, and the
[1:09:00] world wants to go this way, you stand on
[1:09:02] God's word.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, but my
[1:09:06] word shall not pass away. That's right.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Clothe yourself with the word of God.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Don't be shaken by trials. I put this
[1:09:16] down. Storms may hit you, but you can't
[1:09:20] move from your foundation.
[1:09:23] I believe sometimes we've built the
[1:09:25] foundation on the faith and we haven't
[1:09:27] built it with on the right thing. We
[1:09:30] build it on the head knowledge. We build
[1:09:31] it on well, my parents go to church. My
[1:09:34] parents believe a message. It's got to
[1:09:36] get deeper than that.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be standing here today.
[1:09:40] There's some craziness that goes on.
[1:09:42] Brother Ber, I tell you, it seems like
[1:09:44] more in the message than anywhere.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest. I'm just being
[1:09:49] real with you today.
[1:09:52] I would probably be unshaken, unmovable,
[1:09:54] but my ground IS NOT ON PEOPLE or
[1:09:56] opinions or how you feel. IT'S BASED ON
[1:10:00] THE WORD OF GOD. And from Genesis TO
[1:10:02] REVELATION, IT'S GOT TO BECOME A NEW
[1:10:05] BOOK TO you and me.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; The book has to become a new book.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't fell in love with the
[1:10:13] author today, I ENCOURAGE YOU, SAY,
[1:10:15] "GOD, I'M COMING BACK TO MY FIRST LOVE."
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Wherever you left God, if he's second or
[1:10:22] third or fourth place, put him first
[1:10:24] place today.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Put him back first.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; It's like that guy with a geography
[1:10:30] book. I'm like that guy. I bet my wife
[1:10:32] tells me that. I bet she can tell me
[1:10:34] that today. She'd say, "Hey, honey, take
[1:10:36] the book here. Go walk up in the attic.
[1:10:38] Hey, there." No, she wouldn't do this.
[1:10:40] But I'm just saying a friend would come
[1:10:42] over, a worldly friend say, "Brother,
[1:10:44] here's a geography book." Yes.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; And I get up in the attic, brother Ber,
[1:10:49] and start to looking at the ocean and
[1:10:51] start I'll be starting dancing like that
[1:10:53] man BROTHER BROWN TALKED ABOUT
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; CUZ I START TO SEE God in the ocean in
[1:10:57] the trees and what he's done for me.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't NEED A BIBLE BECAUSE HE KNEW
[1:11:03] THE AUTHOR. HE KNEW he saw it
[1:11:05] everywhere.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; He was unmovable, unshaken. No matter
[1:11:09] what, THEY CAN MAKE FUN OF HIM. And here
[1:11:12] he is in the attic praising God. Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; I want to be that. I want to be so
[1:11:18] unmovable, unshakable,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; full of God's glory, ALWAYS ABOUNDING IN
[1:11:25] the work of the Lord.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; If it's JUST FOR ONE PERSON, IT'S WORTH
[1:11:29] A 100 MILES. IT'S WORTH A THOUSAND
[1:11:32] MILES.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you y'all, I don't I was
[1:11:36] telling somebody today, we don't do it
[1:11:37] FOR THE MONEY. WE DO IT FOR one soul.
[1:11:41] He said, "One soul is worth 10 million
[1:11:43] worlds."
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget my tax accountant said
[1:11:46] the other day. She said, "Sir," she
[1:11:48] said, "This business is doing good and
[1:11:50] this business is doing good, but this
[1:11:52] ministry ain't doing too well."
[1:11:55] I'm just being honest. That was last
[1:11:57] year. She said, "Well, you add up this,
[1:11:58] you add this." Well, you're negative
[1:12:00] here. I said, "Ma'am, THAT'S THE BIGGEST
[1:12:02] BANK ACCOUNT I GOT."
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest with you today.
[1:12:09] Man, I'm not here to feel sorry for me.
[1:12:11] I'm here TO TELL YOU, FEEL GOOD FOR ME
[1:12:13] because I'm here TO TELL YOU THAT'S THE
[1:12:15] BIGGEST BANK ACCOUNT YOU GOT.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Your house is going to burn up. Your
[1:12:19] your metal's going to burn up.
[1:12:21] Everything you drove, everything you
[1:12:22] got, you can't take NOTHING WITH YOU.
[1:12:24] BUT THAT INSIDE MAN is going to have A
[1:12:28] CHANGE OF BODY ONE DAY. AND SOMETHING ON
[1:12:31] THE INSIDE, IN A MOMENT, A TWINKLING OF
[1:12:33] AN EYE, you will be changed.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; I WILL BE CHANGED. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
[1:12:39] living for.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; That's what this crazy man up here
[1:12:43] looking crazy is for preaching today.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; But just leave me that way. I'm happy.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; I would rather be here than anywhere
[1:12:53] else.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Even if it's just sitting in the pew, I
[1:12:58] say, "Lord, fill me up today.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask you just fill me up. Give me
[1:13:03] another refilling. Lord, maybe your
[1:13:06] MAYBE YOUR CANDLE WICK, maybe it's just
[1:13:08] barely burning, is a little smoked up
[1:13:10] today. I tell you, wipe it OFF AND SAY,
[1:13:13] "LORD, fill me again.
[1:13:16] FILL ME ON THE INSIDE. GIVE ME THAT
[1:13:19] faith that's unmovable, unshakable,
[1:13:22] always abounding."
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. This might be a part two tonight
[1:13:28] because we ain't getting too far.
[1:13:31] But I thought about verse I wrote this
[1:13:32] down. anchored. You got to be anchored.
[1:13:35] Decisions are guided by the word, not
[1:13:38] your feelings or fear.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Your decisions have to be guided by the
[1:13:43] word of God.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Not because how you feel. Your emotions
[1:13:47] will take you everywhere.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; As brother Bram says, he says, "You can
[1:13:54] I I didn't feel great this morning, but
[1:13:56] I said, you know what? I'm not going off
[1:13:57] my feelings.
[1:14:00] But if I go by the inside,
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I go by the heart and say, "Lord,
[1:14:07] God, I just love you with all I got."
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; But we got to our decisions can't be
[1:14:13] guided but only by the word. If you have
[1:14:16] a Bible question, there's a Bible
[1:14:17] answer.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Young people, if there talks about
[1:14:21] always be I'm just here to tell you. I'm
[1:14:22] I'm getting on my notes, but here we go.
[1:14:24] I'm here to tell you, listen, if you're
[1:14:26] dating someone that's not equally
[1:14:27] yolked, you need to get rid of them.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; You need to get rid of them today.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; If they're not equally yolked, you're
[1:14:36] looking for a life of trouble.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Life's hard enough when you're a
[1:14:40] Christian. You imagine marrying someone
[1:14:42] unequally yolked.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; I'm just here to tell you, don't do it
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; just because they look good. As brother
[1:14:50] Brandon would say, paraphrasing for
[1:14:52] time, but give it 50, 60 years and then
[1:14:54] look at them again. Not saying they
[1:14:56] won't look good. I'm just saying when
[1:14:58] they get wrinkles and I'm just saying,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; even me, when I first met my wife, I was
[1:15:04] all in shape and she fed me so much it
[1:15:06] just keep getting bigger.
[1:15:09] But we still love each other.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; There's something at the inside to say,
[1:15:14] "You're my soulmate."
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; And that's how we got to be with Jesus
[1:15:18] Christ. There's got to be something on
[1:15:20] the inside that your daddy doesn't tell
[1:15:22] you to read the Bible. The daddy doesn't
[1:15:25] TELL YOU TO GO PRAY IN your room
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; or just to live in a home that loves
[1:15:30] God. But you have to get the real
[1:15:32] personal life on the inside
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; if you want to be steadfast, unmovable,
[1:15:40] always abounding.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; So your labors in vain. I thought about
[1:15:46] this. We might go into this tonight, but
[1:15:48] I thought about this. I thought about
[1:15:50] this scripture in Matthew, if we could
[1:15:53] turn there for a minute. Matthew 26.
[1:15:55] Everybody knows the story. Matthew 26
[1:15:57] verse 6. Matthew 26:6. It says, "Now
[1:16:01] when Jesus was in Bethany in the house
[1:16:04] of Simon the leper, there came unto him
[1:16:07] a woman having an alabaster box,
[1:16:10] a very precious ointment, and and poured
[1:16:13] it on his on his head, and he sat in
[1:16:16] me." Listen to this. And when his
[1:16:18] disciples saw it, they had ind
[1:16:20] indignation,
[1:16:22] saying, "To what purpose is this waste?"
[1:16:27] I never really caught that a lot. I
[1:16:28] mean, it might be simple to you today or
[1:16:30] simple to me, but I thought this Bible
[1:16:33] is not waste for you.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; What they call waste was her worship.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; What they call waste was her giving
[1:16:41] everything she's got to her Lord Jesus.
[1:16:44] What people call that are your waste.
[1:16:47] They might tell you you're wasting your
[1:16:48] life. You believe a cult. But what they
[1:16:50] call waste is your life.
[1:16:54] What they call waste out in THIS WORLD
[1:16:56] IS YOUR eternal destination.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Think about that today. Oh, it says that
[1:17:04] that's what your purpose is. That to
[1:17:06] what purpose is this? She's asking the
[1:17:08] disciples, "Is this waste? For this
[1:17:11] ointment that might have been made that
[1:17:13] had been sold for so much and given to
[1:17:16] the poor?"
[1:17:18] Goes on to say, it says, "When Jesus
[1:17:19] understood it, he said unto them, why
[1:17:21] trouble ye woman, for she hath brought a
[1:17:24] good work upon me, for ye have the poor
[1:17:27] always with you, but me ye have not
[1:17:31] always." Verse 12. For in that so sheath
[1:17:35] that hath pou this ointment on my body,
[1:17:38] she did it for my burial. Verily I say
[1:17:42] unto you, what wherever it says,
[1:17:45] wheresoever the gospel shall be preached
[1:17:47] in the whole world, there shall also
[1:17:49] this this woman had done be told for a
[1:17:53] for memorial of her. So this oil she
[1:17:56] had, everything she got thought it was a
[1:17:58] waste. Even the disciples thought it was
[1:18:01] a waste. But guess what? It was not in
[1:18:03] vain.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; It was where is the scripture I'm
[1:18:07] speaking on today. It's not in vain.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; What you're doing is not in vain. Young
[1:18:12] people, every time you get up, every
[1:18:14] time you COME THROUGH THESE DOORS, IT'S
[1:18:16] not in vain.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad when we can just read
[1:18:22] the scriptures and praise God that he
[1:18:24] doesn't just meet us in Jeffersonville,
[1:18:26] he meets us in every building that
[1:18:28] praises Jesus Christ.
[1:18:32] I was listening to the message this
[1:18:34] morning lifting our lifting God out of
[1:18:36] history. I think some of us in here need
[1:18:38] to lift him out of history.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; We need to stop leaving them on a
[1:18:42] bookshelf. Leaving them in for BROTHER
[1:18:44] BRANDHAM'S DAY. WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAY?
[1:18:46] WHAT ABOUT YOUR DELIVERANCE? WHAT ABOUT
[1:18:49] YOUR CANCER? WHAT ABOUT YOUR DIABETES?
[1:18:51] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:18:55] forever.
[1:18:59] We got to lift him out of THE HISTORY.
[1:19:01] HE'S NOT IN history book. He can deliver
[1:19:03] you. He's not in vain.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; You might feel like I come in here,
[1:19:09] brother. I come here. No, you come to
[1:19:11] hear from God.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Every time you come in church, whoever
[1:19:15] it is, JUST SAY, "LORD, GIVE ME
[1:19:17] SOMETHING FROM YOU.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Let him come through my aisle."
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; But it's not in vain. I'm here to tell
[1:19:24] you, living this message, young people,
[1:19:26] is not in vain.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Living it all is not in vain. Just like
[1:19:32] she did. They thought it was waste, but
[1:19:34] it wasn't. It was her eternal
[1:19:36] destination.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; What are you doing for Jesus Christ?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; My question today is it's not in vain,
[1:19:43] but what are you doing with the message
[1:19:45] of the hour?
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Are you living a life worthy of the
[1:19:48] gospel?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Not just for someone with a tie on
[1:19:52] today. I I fail every day. But I'm here
[1:19:54] to tell you, can we do something for
[1:19:56] Jesus?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's on your workplace. Maybe you
[1:20:00] give them $50. Maybe you give them a
[1:20:02] hundred and say, "Hey, I just felt led
[1:20:03] to give it to you." Maybe it's your last
[1:20:06] $50, but I'm here to tell you, I've
[1:20:08] reached in my pocket before and gave my
[1:20:09] last hundred and I'm here to tell you
[1:20:11] somehow we had $1,000 check in the box
[1:20:15] because God gives the increase.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; You got to trust God with everything.
[1:20:20] your finances with everything you got,
[1:20:23] give it to God.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I always tell the boys, I said, "Boys,
[1:20:28] if something happens to daddy, you seek
[1:20:30] the kingdom first. You don't seek
[1:20:32] anything else. You seek the kingdom
[1:20:34] first and then everything else will be
[1:20:35] added."
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; I've always had it backwards. I put this
[1:20:39] verse and that verse and that first in
[1:20:41] life. And then when I when I got to that
[1:20:44] scripture, I said, "Lord, let that be my
[1:20:46] life.
[1:20:47] Let me seek you first with everything I
[1:20:50] got and then everything will be added.
[1:20:52] You won't be begging for bread. You'll
[1:20:54] always have a roof over your head.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's only 600 square ft. Maybe
[1:20:59] it's a mobile home. Maybe it's a double
[1:21:01] wide. Whatever it is, but I tell you
[1:21:03] what, IT FEELS GOOD WHEN IT'S COLD
[1:21:05] OUTSIDE.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; I woke up the other day, Brother Ber,
[1:21:10] and I turned had the heat on. I said,
[1:21:11] "Thank you, God." Lord. AMEN.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; I WALKED OUTSIDE AND I SAID, "NOT TODAY,
[1:21:16] SATAN."
[1:21:19] I just being honest. You ask my wife, I
[1:21:22] I can't stand the cold.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; I walked in there. I said, "Not today."
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; But I started looking. I SAID, "BUT GOD,
[1:21:30] TODAY YOU GAVE ME A ROOF OVER MY HEAD.
[1:21:33] You gave me food to eat. You gave me
[1:21:36] food in my pantry.
[1:21:39] How about you today?" I tell you that
[1:21:42] should put a SHOUT UNDER YOU. THAT
[1:21:44] SHOULD PUT A PUT A ZEAL IN YOUR HEART
[1:21:46] THAT YOU GOT A BED TO lay in.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; We would travel IN ECUADOR LAST YEAR.
[1:21:52] MANY HOUSES didn't merely have a roof,
[1:21:55] raining in the house, raining in the
[1:21:57] church. We were praising the Lord in one
[1:21:59] place, literally pouring wet, sweating
[1:22:01] wet, just just serving God. I said,
[1:22:05] "Lord, if they can WORSHIP LIKE THAT, I
[1:22:07] CAN WORSHIP LIKE THAT.
[1:22:10] I don't care how much water comes in
[1:22:12] here. The lightning was blowing one
[1:22:14] place. The metal ROOF WAS BLAZING. I
[1:22:16] SAID, "LORD, IF YOU TAKE ME HOME, I'LL
[1:22:18] STILL serve you."
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Most of us would take off running when
[1:22:22] we heard lightning. Oh my goodness, I
[1:22:25] got to go hide. But I tell you, it'd be
[1:22:27] good some today, get a little bit
[1:22:29] lightning in your life
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. It'd be good to let
[1:22:34] the Holy GHOST SWEEP THROUGH EVERY EYE,
[1:22:37] EVERY HEART, AND PUT SOMETHING THAT'S
[1:22:40] UNCHANGEABLE, STEADFAST,
[1:22:43] ALWAYS ABOUNDING.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. I'm here to tell you
[1:22:48] today, if I can seek this in your heart,
[1:22:50] THIS WORD, THE STUDY IN YOUR PRAYER LIFE
[1:22:53] IS NOT IN VAIN.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; HEZEKIAH, THINK ABOUT THAT. BROTHER says
[1:23:00] he even ch his prayer CHANGED THE MIND
[1:23:03] OF GOD.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Gave him 15 more years. I never thought
[1:23:08] in my PE brain that you could actually
[1:23:10] change the mind of God.
[1:23:12] BUT THAT YOUR PRAYER could change your
[1:23:15] situation could change the mind of God.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; He would look at you today if he could
[1:23:21] raise up and say it's not in vain.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Your prayer life reading the word. You
[1:23:28] can read everything else.
[1:23:30] You can scroll Facebook for hours and
[1:23:32] hours and hours and hours.
[1:23:37] How much do you stroll down this
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; from Genesis to Revelation? I know we
[1:23:43] don't have a backing, but I like it this
[1:23:44] way. I like it worn. My wife goes, "I
[1:23:48] got you four more new Bibles." I said,
[1:23:49] "Yeah, you'll have to figure that out. I
[1:23:51] I just like what I got. I it's getting
[1:23:54] all torn up. But I'm here to tell you I
[1:23:56] just like it because I know I feel like
[1:23:58] I can feel the imprints on each Bible
[1:24:00] page the and the tears that I've wept
[1:24:03] and said, "Lord, I need more of you."
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Have we got to a place we're so anchored
[1:24:10] in God that says, "God, I'm going to be
[1:24:12] steadfast, unmovable
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; cuz it's not in vain."
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, we'll be
[1:24:18] accountable for what we tell you in
[1:24:20] these churches. And I'm here to tell
[1:24:21] you, it's not in vain. You living for
[1:24:24] God is the best choice you could ever
[1:24:27] live. Young people, get to Christ as
[1:24:30] fast as you can. IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
[1:24:33] BAPTIZED, I say, "LET'S TURN THE WATER
[1:24:36] ON.
[1:24:38] NO MORE WAITING. THE ARK DOORS CLOSING."
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; And when he shuts it, no man can open
[1:24:45] it.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; We won't be able to open it when it's
[1:24:48] the last one. Maybe it's the one in
[1:24:51] church today. I don't know. Maybe it's
[1:24:53] the one in the next church. I don't
[1:24:54] know. But I'm here to tell you, Brother
[1:24:56] Ber, if you get them in, praise God.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care who gets them in. I told
[1:25:02] Brother George Smith the other day, I
[1:25:03] WAS LIKE, "HEY, I DON'T CARE if you get
[1:25:05] THEM IN OR I GET THEM IN. I DON'T HAVE A
[1:25:07] CHECKLIST.
[1:25:09] JUST GET THEM IN. IF YOU GET THEM IN,
[1:25:12] I'LL HUG YOU AT THE WEDDING supper and
[1:25:14] say, "Praise God, Brother Joe. YOU GET
[1:25:17] HIM IN." I'm going to be like, "Brother,
[1:25:18] HE WAS ON YOUR JOB."
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's somebody don't even look like
[1:25:24] a message believer.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Too many times where Well, let me see.
[1:25:30] Brother Ber, let me just see how long
[1:25:33] your hair is.
[1:25:35] You know, if y'all would have saw me
[1:25:36] about 21, two, three years ago, you
[1:25:39] wouldn't even gave me grace.
[1:25:42] Shaped in iniquity, speaking lies,
[1:25:45] playing with the world. Young people,
[1:25:46] I'm here to tell you, it'll keep you
[1:25:48] longer than you want to stay.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; It'll hold you. The devil will put you
[1:25:52] on a gutter somewhere and say, "Hey,
[1:25:54] this is a real good life, but it ain't
[1:25:56] life with sin." And it's just for a
[1:25:58] season. It might feel good for a moment,
[1:26:01] but I'm here to tell you, it doesn't
[1:26:03] last long.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, ever since I
[1:26:06] met Jesus, ever since I got came to the
[1:26:09] author, it's done something for me. It's
[1:26:12] gave me a purpose to live.
[1:26:15] It's gave you a purpose to live.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe you woke up, oh, I'm tired and
[1:26:20] weary today. I'm here to wake you up and
[1:26:22] tell you to get steadfast in the Lord.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Be unmovable.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Get anchored in Christ.
[1:26:30] I thought about this. Maybe this will
[1:26:32] encourage you. We want to talk about
[1:26:35] being steadfast. This is not in vain.
[1:26:38] We'll just call it it's not in vain. I
[1:26:40] thought about Hebrews. Turn to Hebrews.
[1:26:51] Hebrews 10. Turn to Hebrews 10. Thought
[1:26:54] about it's not in vain. Let's read this
[1:26:59] verse 10. It says, "For the law having a
[1:27:03] shadow of good things to come, and not
[1:27:05] the very image of things, can never with
[1:27:07] those sacrifice which were offered year
[1:27:10] by year continually to make the comers
[1:27:12] there unto perfect. For then would they
[1:27:16] would not have ceased to be offered,
[1:27:18] because they that that they worship once
[1:27:22] purged should have no one more conscious
[1:27:24] of sins. But in those sacrifices there
[1:27:27] is a remembrance again made of sins
[1:27:30] every year. It says for it is not
[1:27:33] possible for that blood of bulls and
[1:27:34] goats should take away the sins. I want
[1:27:37] you to understand it was a temporary
[1:27:39] covering.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; It was a they had to do it every single
[1:27:43] year. The priests had to go in with the
[1:27:44] bell and they had to go to the holiest
[1:27:46] of holiest to make intercession.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And if you didn't hear that bell that
[1:27:51] mean they fell out. They might come in
[1:27:52] there unclean.
[1:27:54] They'd have to pull him out.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; But listen to this.
[1:27:58] Let's talk about not in vain. Verse N.
[1:28:01] But then said he, oh Lo, I come to thy
[1:28:04] will, oh God. He taketh away the first
[1:28:07] that it may be established the second.
[1:28:09] It says, but by wi by the which we shall
[1:28:13] are sanctified through all offering of
[1:28:14] the body of Jesus Christ. What? Once for
[1:28:17] all.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. It's once for all. I
[1:28:24] DON'T CARE HOW FAR YOU WENT, HOW FAR
[1:28:27] YOU'VE GONE IN SIN. His sin, his grace
[1:28:30] is sufficient.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; It's once for all.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; It's a once for all covering.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; There you go. It's not in vain right
[1:28:40] here. And every priest standeth daily
[1:28:43] ministering offering often verse 11 the
[1:28:46] same sacrifices which can cover and take
[1:28:48] away sins. But this man
[1:28:52] Oh, after he had offered one sacrifice
[1:28:54] for sins forever, sat down at the right
[1:28:57] hand of God. For henceforth, expecting
[1:29:00] to this enemies be made his foottool.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; For by one offering he had perfected
[1:29:06] forever them that are sanctified. I like
[1:29:09] this verse 19. Having therefore
[1:29:11] brethren, listen to this, it's not in
[1:29:14] vain. boldness every one of us to to to
[1:29:19] the holiest into the holiest by the
[1:29:21] blood of Jesus.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you can enter enter
[1:29:25] into the holiest of holiest because
[1:29:28] Jesus Christ stepped down
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; paid the ultimate sin ONCE FOR ALL. IT'S
[1:29:34] NOT IN VAIN.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say, he says, "By a
[1:29:39] new living way." Hey, if you don't have
[1:29:42] a new and living way, I tell you today
[1:29:43] to get to the altar, get to your seat,
[1:29:46] turn around in the altar, in your pew,
[1:29:47] wherever you in your car, and say,
[1:29:49] "Lord, I want a new living way
[1:29:53] of which he had consecrated for us
[1:29:55] through the veil, that is to say, his
[1:29:58] flesh, and having a high priest over the
[1:30:00] house of God, let us draw what? near
[1:30:03] with a true heart, full assurance of
[1:30:05] faith,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:30:08] conscience, our bodies washed with pure
[1:30:10] water. Verse 30, 2023.
[1:30:13] Let us hold fast to the profession of
[1:30:15] our faith with what? With what? Without
[1:30:18] wavering.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; For he that have faithful that promise,
[1:30:22] and let us consider one another to
[1:30:25] provoke, to love, and what? Good works.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; This will do us some good today. Verse
[1:30:32] 25, not forsaken the assembly of
[1:30:34] ourselves together as some manner some
[1:30:37] is. I could actually tell you a lot.
[1:30:39] There is some is. I better not go into
[1:30:41] detail, but there is some is today.
[1:30:44] As the manner of some is by exhorting
[1:30:46] one another and so much more as the day
[1:30:48] of approaching. I'm just thankful that I
[1:30:51] can take everything in this Bible and if
[1:30:53] it's not in here, I don't believe you.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Every word's a lie. Brother said 99% is
[1:30:59] still a lie. But I want a 100% of it.
[1:31:02] Brother Joe, I want it all.
[1:31:05] I DON'T WANT NO WATERED DOWN GOSPEL. I
[1:31:08] WANT THE ENTIRE TRUTH. IF IT CLEANS ME
[1:31:10] UP, if it puts me on solid ground, and
[1:31:13] if if IT TAKES AWAY CANCER, I WANT THAT.
[1:31:16] IF IT TAKES AWAY DIABETES, if it heals
[1:31:19] your kids, IF IT SAVES YOUR
[1:31:21] GRANDCHILDREN, I WANT THAT.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; It's not in vain.
[1:31:28] You're not coming to church. It's not in
[1:31:31] vain, old people. It's not in vain. I
[1:31:33] bet you I bet you they would tell you
[1:31:35] it's not in vain. I bet you loved ones
[1:31:37] that's passed on would tell you today.
[1:31:39] My father-in-law preached this message
[1:31:41] all around the world for like 50 or 60
[1:31:43] years. He just went with the Lord. And I
[1:31:45] preached his last sermon
[1:31:48] and he was sitting there and I said,
[1:31:49] "Lord, let me run this race like he
[1:31:53] did."
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Let me run it with all I got.
[1:31:58] I would walk into his room the last
[1:31:59] hours of his day.
[1:32:02] His mind literally started slipping. I
[1:32:04] would walk through the door and he would
[1:32:06] literally ask Rachel. He would light up
[1:32:08] when you walk in the room and he say,
[1:32:10] "Brother Chris, you know what brother
[1:32:12] Bam says about this? You know what the
[1:32:13] B?" I was like, he wouldn't even know
[1:32:15] his name. He wouldn't barely know where
[1:32:17] he was some days, but he knew the Bible
[1:32:20] and he knew the message
[1:32:22] because it WAS ON THE INSIDE. IT WASN'T
[1:32:25] A MIND PROBLEM. IT WAS A HARD PROBLEM.
[1:32:28] I'm here to tell you to get IT ON THE
[1:32:31] INSIDE. LET IT BE A living witness read
[1:32:34] of all men.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; I'll be in a conversation with people
[1:32:38] sometimes, brother B. I don't know the
[1:32:40] scripture. I don't know that. I don't
[1:32:41] care. BUT I'LL TELL YOU, I'LL lead you
[1:32:43] to the author.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; If it could change this old boy, it
[1:32:46] could change everybody.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But it wasn't in vain when Christ
[1:32:54] has it said once for all. And it said,
[1:32:57] "Let us consider one another. Provoke us
[1:32:59] not forsaken the assembler of oursel."
[1:33:01] I'm here to tell young people, every
[1:33:03] time the doors are open, young people,
[1:33:05] old people, no matter what age you are,
[1:33:07] it's better than your gas station. It's
[1:33:08] better. It's better than your bank
[1:33:10] account. It's better than any money you
[1:33:12] can make. Because I'll tell you what,
[1:33:14] that's just two days a week you give to
[1:33:15] the Lord. Do you give them every single
[1:33:17] day? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[1:33:20] Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. You
[1:33:23] give them every day.
[1:33:26] Young people, do you give them every day
[1:33:28] of your life?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Not just when the preacher shows up and
[1:33:33] has studied a message or studied a book
[1:33:36] all week for one 40-minute service,
[1:33:39] but have you got in the book?
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you, church, to get
[1:33:45] in this book. Every bit of it is good.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Genesis to Revelation. Every bit of it
[1:33:52] good. It's needed for you. It's needed
[1:33:54] for me
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; because you're always waring this flesh
[1:33:57] and the inside.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; What dog, as he would say, what dog are
[1:34:01] you feeding the most?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Which dog are you feeding the most?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; You'll know it when you get on the
[1:34:09] streets today. If you ain't fed the
[1:34:10] wrong dog, you get cut off. You're like,
[1:34:12] "Oh, Jesus, I'll take the wheel.
[1:34:16] Yeah,
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; I'm human, too. I'm just being honest.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Someone cuts you off. Lord Jesus, I know
[1:34:22] I'm saved.
[1:34:24] But you know something on the inside has
[1:34:26] changed.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; You know, every time you get up, you
[1:34:31] cannot stand. You don't want You want to
[1:34:33] come to church. You want to be We need
[1:34:35] each other. This is an hour, I'm here to
[1:34:38] tell you, we're living in a late hour
[1:34:39] that the backbiting's got to stop.
[1:34:43] Preacher against preacher, leoty against
[1:34:46] leoty, evangelist against ley. Uh this
[1:34:49] big preacher VERSUS THAT PREACHER. WE'RE
[1:34:51] ALL IN THE SAME BOAT. WE DON'T HAVE NO
[1:34:54] BIG EYES, little te's. We're all in it
[1:34:57] together.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; You don't HAVE A SPECIAL SEAT. WELL,
[1:35:00] brother Ber, I'm just going to give you
[1:35:02] a special seat at this table and down
[1:35:04] here. Brother Ber, you're going to sit
[1:35:05] here. You know, we're just going to be
[1:35:07] all at the table.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; I'm just YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT LOOKING
[1:35:11] FOR A SPECIAL big somebody. I'M LOOKING
[1:35:13] FOR JESUS CHRIST to walk in and grab his
[1:35:17] te and wipe our tears AND SAY, "OH, IT'S
[1:35:20] FINISHED. ALL THE BATTLE SCARS,
[1:35:23] EVERYTHING YOU'VE been through." When
[1:35:25] Jesus walks in the room, that's when
[1:35:27] it's going to change.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; You think about it. He said that he
[1:35:34] would come by and wipe her tears and
[1:35:36] say, "It's finished."
[1:35:39] He said he even said the battle scars.
[1:35:41] You'd be sitting there at that table
[1:35:44] spread. You talking about a
[1:35:46] Thanksgiving. What a Thanksgiving feast
[1:35:48] that will be
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? I don't even want to
[1:35:52] eat. I just want to kneel at his feet
[1:35:54] for a thousand years and say, "Lord, I
[1:35:57] don't deserve to be here, but Lord, I
[1:35:59] just want to wash my wash your feet with
[1:36:01] my tears. I want to put some anointment
[1:36:04] on your feet. I want to feel the nail
[1:36:07] for N pill's hands. It's like uh Fanny
[1:36:10] CROSBY SAID, "HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KNOW
[1:36:12] ME? I'm not going to KNOW HIM BY MY
[1:36:14] SIGHT, but I'll know him by the nails in
[1:36:16] his hands."
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; You might think, "Hey, Chris is just a
[1:36:22] little crazy this morning." No, I just
[1:36:24] love the Lord.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I love this message more than I loved it
[1:36:28] 20 years ago.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; This is my life.
[1:36:34] I want to go down if I have to go in the
[1:36:36] grave. I want to live this to the day I
[1:36:38] die.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Not a perfect life. I can't do that. But
[1:36:41] I have a perfect atonement.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; And you have a perfect atonement. WHEN
[1:36:47] YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, YOUNG PEOPLE, old
[1:36:49] people, HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A
[1:36:51] MISTAKE. But you have a perfect
[1:36:54] atonement today. A ONCE FOR ALL.
[1:36:58] A once for all atonement.
[1:37:02] Aren't you glad that God don't go up to
[1:37:04] you and go, "Well, Brother Ber, let me
[1:37:05] see what you committed today."
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; We were over in Israel. We went to Rome,
[1:37:11] Brother Joe, and we were sitting there,
[1:37:13] and I'm tell you what, we walked into
[1:37:14] the Vatican, and we walked over there,
[1:37:17] and these is confession booths all the
[1:37:18] way down. They're probably streaming it
[1:37:20] today. God bless you. And they they had
[1:37:23] they had it pull through here. They had
[1:37:25] all these these confession booths.
[1:37:29] And I thought, Lord, I just started to
[1:37:32] lift my hands. I said, 'Lord, I'd be
[1:37:34] just like them if it wasn't for the
[1:37:36] grace of God.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; I'd be saying it to some priest or
[1:37:40] something. But I'm here to tell you,
[1:37:41] bring it to the high priest today.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Bring it to only one priest, the name of
[1:37:46] Jesus Christ.
[1:37:48] That's the only name above all names.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he's came in your
[1:37:53] day and he's led the light? He gave you
[1:37:56] the entire book.
[1:37:59] He's opened the entire word.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; And it's not in vain.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; It's not in vain.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, my soul
[1:38:10] grieavves for the way that things go and
[1:38:12] I was driving down the road. I was tell
[1:38:14] I said my I was at this little concert
[1:38:16] and I said, "Lord, my my soul grieves."
[1:38:18] I was sitting there. I started crying. I
[1:38:20] said, "Lord, they can have this much fun
[1:38:22] with God, BUT WE SIT like this on Sunday
[1:38:25] and Wednesday.
[1:38:27] Yeah,
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; I believe a message is so good. Brother
[1:38:31] Ber,
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I've been here for 40 years. God sent a
[1:38:36] prophet. You know, the devil knows that
[1:38:38] he sent him a prophet.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; The devil knows the word. The devil
[1:38:42] knows that brother Brandham, William
[1:38:44] Maron Brennham is a prophet in our day.
[1:38:46] But I'm here to tell you, do you know?
[1:38:49] Do you know it's SOMETHING ON THE
[1:38:51] INSIDE? IT'S NOT JUST TO SIT back and
[1:38:53] relax and just say, "Well, I'm just
[1:38:56] going to hang out. I believe a message."
[1:38:57] No, it's something that I provoke you
[1:39:00] today to get in the word. Let it become
[1:39:03] REAL IN YOUR LIFE. Let you become
[1:39:06] written epistles read of all men.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know that that's free. I ain't
[1:39:12] anything in my notes.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, I'm tired of
[1:39:16] seeing it.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; They worship the Lord. I'm just I was
[1:39:19] weeping. Brother Tom, I said, "Brother
[1:39:21] Ber," I was just weeping. I said, "Lord,
[1:39:23] if they can serve their God just like
[1:39:26] they can, how about me?"
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; I literally thought in my heart, "HOW
[1:39:31] ABOUT ME?" WHEN THE ENTIRE BOOK, I GOT
[1:39:34] THE KEYS TO UNLOCK THE DOOR. YOU HAD the
[1:39:38] keys to unlock the door. But why do we
[1:39:41] walk through church, well, my back
[1:39:43] hurts. I'm just not going to make it to
[1:39:45] church today. I'm going to stream today.
[1:39:48] That sounds good. I'll stay in my
[1:39:49] pajamas.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; He might be my last service, but I still
[1:39:57] love every one of you. I love Brother
[1:39:59] Ber with all my heart.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; We get in my pajamas and I'll put them
[1:40:03] on. Get me a cup of coffee.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I got a sniffle today.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Maybe I'm speaking to
[1:40:10] somebody.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; You know what? I feel like that the
[1:40:13] online streaming has bring us I love it.
[1:40:16] Praise God. When you really are sick and
[1:40:18] you need it, praise God.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; But when I got a sniffle, I get in the
[1:40:22] car.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; I wake up. I say, "Boys, the voice say,
[1:40:26] "Well, Dave, I'm not feeling good."
[1:40:27] Well, you better have a very high
[1:40:29] temperature or you you Let me tell you
[1:40:31] something. You better barely be walking.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; He He'll tell you, "You're getting in
[1:40:36] the car and going to church
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; because as the Bible says, ask for me in
[1:40:41] my house.
[1:40:45] Ask for me in my house. We'll serve the
[1:40:48] Lord.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; And you know that SERVE PART, THAT PART
[1:40:52] that says serve, that's an action word.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Did you know serve means do something?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Not that I BELIEVE A MESSAGE AND THAT'S
[1:41:06] IT.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; It means to do something for God.
[1:41:11] DON'T JUST HOLD IT TO YOURSELF. THERE
[1:41:13] MIGHT BE THE LAST SEED ON YOUR JOB.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE WAITING for you to introduce
[1:41:19] Jesus Christ to them.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; I think about the dentist. I think about
[1:41:24] the dentist. He looks at brother Billy
[1:41:26] one time and hope I'm saying okay. He
[1:41:28] looks at brother Benny. Billy sitting in
[1:41:30] there and he hands him the book. He
[1:41:32] says, "Why didn't you tell me about
[1:41:33] this?
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. Why didn't you tell me
[1:41:40] about this? This was your daddy.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Never forget my dad looked at me one
[1:41:46] day. He said, "You believe the same
[1:41:48] stuff your grandmother preached."
[1:41:50] Believed. He said, "I I drove you
[1:41:52] church. I flew in every single state. I
[1:41:56] actually moved jobs everywhere I could,
[1:41:58] as far away from your grandmother as I
[1:42:00] could." Think about it today.
[1:42:03] Predestinated children. you are
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; traveled the whole world in a plastic
[1:42:08] plant making millions and he would bring
[1:42:10] us the next house, the next house, the
[1:42:12] next house to North Carolina, Toledo,
[1:42:14] Ohio. I lived under a bridge. I ran away
[1:42:17] from home at a very young age.
[1:42:21] I'm here to tell you young people, I
[1:42:23] don't care how broke up your life is.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; I don't care how far you away from God.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to tell you, we have a
[1:42:30] gracious savior today that can bring you
[1:42:33] back home. If you're a prodal son,
[1:42:35] wherever you are, your children might be
[1:42:37] far away. I'm here to tell you, don't
[1:42:40] stop praying for them. Don't give up on
[1:42:42] them.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; But he would say, he looked at me, we've
[1:42:47] been getting married 20 years this
[1:42:48] coming year.
[1:42:50] And he looked at us in the five years of
[1:42:52] marriage and he walks up, he goes, "The
[1:42:54] very thing
[1:42:56] that I kept you away all my life, you
[1:42:58] and your brother went into." I started
[1:43:00] crying. I said, "Lord, Dad, why couldn't
[1:43:02] I get to it sooner? My life wouldn't
[1:43:05] have been so wrecked up." And I'm here
[1:43:07] to tell you, young people, it's not in
[1:43:09] vain.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; This message, young people, old people
[1:43:14] like, this message of what we got is not
[1:43:17] in vain.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Don't take it for granted.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; As the musicians come, I'll finish up
[1:43:23] tonight.
[1:43:25] I want to read this quote.
[1:43:28] He said, "How's the gates going to
[1:43:29] open?" He said, "The button pressed and
[1:43:33] the pearly gate swung open. Here come
[1:43:36] Jesus led captive.
[1:43:38] Here he comes down as a conqueror
[1:43:41] walking down through the cities of new
[1:43:43] heavens."
[1:43:44] As they play something softly, the
[1:43:46] prophet of God says, "And he walked up
[1:43:48] in front of the father and he said,
[1:43:49] "Father, here they are.
[1:43:53] They all died under good faith."
[1:43:55] The prophet of God says, "Under the
[1:43:57] sacrifice of the lamb," he said, "but I
[1:43:59] present him to you." He said, "Well
[1:44:02] done." He said, 'Come up here and sit up
[1:44:05] right on my right hand, for I am going
[1:44:07] to send the Holy Ghost back down. It's
[1:44:10] not in vain, church. He goes on to say,
[1:44:14] "And you sit here until every enemy is
[1:44:16] made your foottool."
[1:44:19] He said, "Glory to God. We look for him
[1:44:21] to come again someday in glory." Listen
[1:44:25] to this.
[1:44:27] He said, "And those who are in the dust
[1:44:30] of the earth shall rise and be changed
[1:44:32] in the moment of twinkling an eye and be
[1:44:34] made like unto us." He said, "They shall
[1:44:37] possess the gates of the enemy." He
[1:44:39] says, "When they are all going to chop
[1:44:41] his head off like Paul, St. Paul, he
[1:44:43] said, "Death, where is your sting?
[1:44:46] Grave, where is your victory? But thanks
[1:44:48] be to God who gives us the victory
[1:44:50] through the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:44:53] He goes on to say, he says, "Oh, you
[1:44:55] think I'm a little crazy, don't you?" I
[1:44:58] say, "Praise God." He says, "But I'm
[1:45:00] sure feel good this way." He said, "Just
[1:45:03] don't let me alone. See how wonderful
[1:45:05] good some glorious day the last en last
[1:45:09] enemy I have, which is death, will be
[1:45:12] trampled under right under their feet.
[1:45:15] As with the conqueror, we shall march
[1:45:17] through the city." Oh, he says, "Today
[1:45:20] will be the harvest is on. Let's go.
[1:45:22] Listen to this. It don't say. He don't
[1:45:25] say, "Let's go. Just sit down." He said,
[1:45:27] "Let's go about gathering in the sheavs
[1:45:31] everywhere. Whatever God gives you to
[1:45:34] do, you're a little housewife. Testify
[1:45:37] to your neighbors or something. Do
[1:45:39] something. Bring somebody with you when
[1:45:43] you come."
[1:45:46] That's the message. That's an axe
[1:45:49] experience. That's something that God's
[1:45:51] saying, "Act out. Be your be the hands
[1:45:53] and feet of Jesus.
[1:45:56] It's not in vain." And you know what?
[1:45:59] One place he said, and I'm paraphrasing
[1:46:00] for time, one place he said he would
[1:46:02] attach a name when you get over there,
[1:46:05] he would you would have names attached
[1:46:06] to you.
[1:46:08] Oh, that humbles me. I don't not looking
[1:46:11] for some numbers or some big great
[1:46:13] numbers. I'm here to tell you, I just
[1:46:14] want to see one one more life dedicated
[1:46:17] for Christ.
[1:46:18] One more like to say I want it. I want
[1:46:20] more of them. With all heads bowed this
[1:46:23] morning,
[1:46:29] I feel like I've saved enough to save
[1:46:31] the whole church
[1:46:33] with the word of God that's went forth.
[1:46:37] Maybe there's one person in this entire
[1:46:39] place, no one looking around to say,
[1:46:42] "Hey, I want that.
[1:46:45] I want that, Lord.
[1:46:47] I want that real consecrated life
[1:46:51] on the inside. God bless you. God bless
[1:46:56] you. God sees you. No one looking
[1:46:59] around. Just say, "God," just be real
[1:47:00] with God. Say, "Lord, it's not in vain
[1:47:04] today. He sees your hands. He sees your
[1:47:07] life. God bless you." God bless you.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Oh God, fill them, Lord. Fill them with
[1:47:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Lord.
[1:47:17] God, if someone's sick today, whatever
[1:47:19] they need today, Lord, may you touch
[1:47:21] them. May you encourage them.
[1:47:24] Oh God, I know how life is. It's tolls
[1:47:27] and tears and trials, but you said
[1:47:30] they're for our good, Lord.
[1:47:33] Oh God, may you come in this place today
[1:47:36] in Jesus name.
[1:47:39] Oh, let's sing that song. When the
[1:47:41] saints are gathering in. I know it's
[1:47:43] kind of fast, but I like it.
[1:47:46] When the saints
[1:47:50] are gathering in
[1:47:54] for
[1:47:57] free from loss. Oh, come on.
[1:48:00] I will shout
[1:48:03] and I will sing
[1:48:07] when there Oh, put your name there.
[1:48:13] Oh, when the rain
[1:48:16] gathering
[1:48:20] wash my soul
[1:48:23] and victory.
[1:48:26] Oh, worship. I will shout.
[1:48:29] Come on. We'll see
[1:48:33] when the redee
[1:48:43] world. Oh, think about when the reading
[1:48:49] are gathering
[1:48:55] singing over
[1:48:59] when the rain
[1:49:02] gathering. Oh, sing it. When the rain
[1:49:08] got raining
[1:49:12] like snow.
[1:49:18] I will shout
[1:49:21] and I will sing
[1:49:25] the
[1:49:28] gathering.
[1:49:30] Well, then the Savior will give orders
[1:49:34] to prepare the banquet for when the
[1:49:38] redeemed
[1:49:40] are gathering in.
[1:49:44] All the angels all will listen for they
[1:49:48] cannot join that song. When the redeemed
[1:49:53] our gathering in
[1:49:56] Oh, when the redeemed
[1:49:59] our gathering in
[1:50:03] will wash
[1:50:06] and free from all sin.
[1:50:09] And I will shout
[1:50:12] and I will sing
[1:50:16] when the redeemed
[1:50:19] are gathering in once again. Oh when the
[1:50:23] redeemed
[1:50:25] are gathering in
[1:50:29] wash like snow
[1:50:32] and free from all sin.
[1:50:37] I will shout and I will sing
[1:50:41] when the redeemed
[1:50:44] are gathering in. Amen.
[1:50:49] Amen.
[1:50:51] Yes. Amen. Amen. I believe there's some
[1:50:55] redeemed here this morning. Don't you?
[1:50:58] Amen. Don't you love him this morning?
[1:51:00] Well, I love him better every day. Oh,
[1:51:04] yes.
[1:51:06] Oh, and I love him better every day.
[1:51:12] Oh, and close by.
[1:51:16] Well, I will abide.
[1:51:19] Oh, I love him better every day.
[1:51:25] Oh, and I love him better every day.
[1:51:30] Yes.
[1:51:31] Oh, and I love him better every day.
[1:51:38] Oh, and close by his side. Well, I will
[1:51:43] abide
[1:51:45] I love him better every day.
[1:51:51] Amen. You love him with all your heart.
[1:51:54] You have anything to say, Brother
[1:51:55] Thomas? Amen. I sure enjoyed that this
[1:51:58] morning, didn't you?
[1:52:00] Amen. And I also I I didn't uh tell you,
[1:52:04] but I appreciate you those that called
[1:52:06] and text and
[1:52:09] checked in on us while we were sick. And
[1:52:11] I just I don't ever want to
[1:52:14] not be thankful for your prayers because
[1:52:17] God's been good to me. I don't know
[1:52:19] about you, but he's been really good to
[1:52:22] me. Amen. Let's sing that as we go. If
[1:52:26] you're walking through shadow, God is
[1:52:27] good all the time. Let's sing a couple
[1:52:29] of verses and then you can be dismissed.
[1:52:31] Well, if you're walking
[1:52:35] through a valley,
[1:52:38] well, there are shadows
[1:52:41] all around.
[1:52:44] Well, do not fear.
[1:52:47] Well, he will guide you. Oh, he will
[1:52:52] keep you safe and sound.
[1:52:57] Oh, he has promised
[1:53:00] he'd never leave you
[1:53:04] nor forsake you.
[1:53:07] And his word is true. God is good
[1:53:14] all the time.
[1:53:17] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[1:53:22] of mine. God is good
[1:53:27] all the time
[1:53:30] and through the darkest
[1:53:32] night his light will shine. God is good.
[1:53:39] Oh, he's so good
[1:53:43] all the time.
[1:53:46] Well, we were sinners,
[1:53:49] so unworthy.
[1:53:53] Yet for us, he chose to die.
[1:53:59] He filled us with
[1:54:02] the Holy Spirit.
[1:54:05] Now we can stand and testify.
[1:54:12] Oh, that his love
[1:54:15] is never ending
[1:54:18] and his mercy,
[1:54:21] oh, they will never end. God is good.
[1:54:26] God bless you. You can go all the time.
[1:54:31] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[1:54:36] of mine. God is good.
[1:54:40] all the time
[1:54:43] and through the darkest
[1:54:46] night.
