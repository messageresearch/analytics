we appreciate you being here and just looking just evaluating the crowd brother Mooney good to see you buddy so we want to take a little service tonight if we would and while you're standing I won't you turn into the Book of Genesis and chapter 41 and we just get right into the word Wednesday nights we try not to hold and and that's our that's our intentions is try to get you out not that we're trying to rush and we're not pushing we want to get into the word and stay into the word but we definitely want to uh get you home at a decent hour school's started the days are getting shorter and and we know you got things uh pressing on you for tomorrow so but how many can give us 40 30 40 minutes of tonight for the Lord amen I believe he's worthy and desire and deserves at least 40 45 minutes of our time because he devotes all of his time to his bread so um while you turn in there I'm going to read you just a little quote I want you to to listen to this and brother brandom's talking here and he says his church stands alone now where he uses church I'm going to use bride you know he said those words could be changed out at the end he said the church is the bride so he says and his bride stands alone she is not hooked with nothing she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God God being the body that God dwelt in and the bride is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body brothers and sisters we are God In Action we are his body in his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last day and she listen to what he says and she and she alone stands by it am what is it she's standing by she is standing upon the infallible word of Jesus Christ she is standing and living the message of the hour she is standing there you see because there's many churches there's there's many churches there's many Christians there's many Creeds many religions but what they are they standing on it's not the word it's not the message of the hour they're standing upon Creeds but she and she alone stands by it he says that's why the devil is howling and that's why these great organizations to set up to do something to close her up it's the devil's goal to try to stop you to hold you back to keep you from being who God wants you to be so here we can see today as we're looking at this we can see that the church system the political system the secular World their whole purpose is to hinder the moving of the spirit of God in action in the last days so they're discouraging Holiness they're discouraging a holy way of living a a and and instead of inviting Holiness and welcoming the power of God in their midst they have an attitude of anything go anything is tolerated as long as you come on Sunday as long as you come to the dinner as long as you come on Wednesday as long as you're at the prayer meeting the Bible study everything goes come as you are their motto is come as you are I guess leave as you are ours is a little different come as you are everybody's welcome but don't leave the way you can't and that's the way it is every time we come to church I don't care how long you've been serving every time we come it should be that we come to God change me if I have a bad attitude if I have a a ill desire if there's something in my life that is that is that is a desire or a habit that is not pleasing God change me because why I stand by the word that try to close her up listen what he says but they'll never do it that gives some reassurance they'll never do it he says she'll be taken up not closed up taken up now she's risen and now by the power of the Vindicated word promised to her how a bride holds on to that promise he said he told me he would return after me and I believe it do you believe it tell your neighbor I believe it he's coming after me I'm standing on the word yeah he says to meet what her headship to meet her headship you mean she's not headstrong she's obedient to the headship I'm talking about the bride I'm not talking about other systems I'm talking about the bride now she's waiting on him and to meet her headship her Redeemer her husband her King her Lord you mean she's submissive you can only call Lord somebody that you're submitting to we were at a restaurant and I'm keeping y'all standing forgive me we were at a restaurant the other day and the woman waitress kept saying my lady my lady talking to my wife my lady do you want another drink my lady I'm like man we ain't living in the in in the times of MacArthur here I don't know what her goal was but here the ride is waiting for her Lord he said she's he's she's waiting for her lover she is waiting for her savior in a provided meeting place Genesis chter 41 38 and Pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man whom the spirit of God is and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as God has showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as Thou Art Thou thou sh be over my house and according to Thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thou and Pharaoh said unto Joseph see I have set over thee all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his ring off of his hand and put it on Joseph's hand and arrayed him with vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him ride in the second Chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh called Joseph name zephani panah and he gave him a wife asath the daughter of Piper priest of an and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt now watch this and Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt and Joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt and in seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same and Joseph gathered corn as a sand of the sea very much until uh he left numbering for it was without number this man's making preparations and Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which were which asenath the son of Piper the priest of an bear unto him and Joseph called the name of the firstborn manassei for God he said hath made me forget all of my toil aren't you thankful for that and all of my father's house and the name of the second was called Ephraim for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my Affliction God won't leave us without and the seven years of plenteous that was the land of Egypt were ended and the seven years of Dar began to come and according as Joseph had said and the DAR was in all the lands and but in the land of Egypt there was bread let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thankful that you've given us an opportunity to come and just to to get into your presence once again Lord and and and to see what the word and what what your word would have in store for us tonight that your what your spirit would speak to our hearts Lord we just ask that there would be a communion take place tonight that would draw us into a greater love and a greater passion for you father Lord we just ask Lord as we begin to deliver the the word that you would allow me to step myself completely out of the way I'm just a just a microphone tonight Lord but I ask that it would be your voice that would speak to the people tonight and that their hearts would be open Lord to to receive what you have tonight for us we love you Lord and thank you for this day in Jesus name amen you can have your seats tonight I want to speak for just a little bit if I could on a topic I'm going to call Fit For A King fit Fit For A King now I don't know about you but I just love to see myself in the word of God how many loves to see yourself in the word of God that's important because when you find yourself identified in the word of God you can then begin to relate to the word and that word begins to speak to you and it begins to to do you something in your heart and it begins to mold you and make you it shows you how much God cares about you it shows you how much he loves you and it places you in God's thoughts now as we look at this tonight about 25% of the Book of Genesis is about Joseph and so uh and I it's like we get to know him personally when we look at the Book of Genesis and read about Joseph God has opened up so many great details about his character he tells us about his strengths he tells us about his weaknesses he tells us how he overcomes adversity he tells us how he forgives how he provides and we can go on and on and on because of everyone in the Bible Joseph is most the person that is most like Jesus so I want to take and just lay a foundation and I want to lay a foundation tonight and as you listen to these comparisons let's take a little time here Joseph was his father's favorite son the father said of Jesus this is my beloved son Joseph was a Shepherd Jesus we know was The Good The Great the chief Shepherd Joseph was sent by his father to search for his brother Jesus said peace to you as the father has sent me I also send you are you seeing the correlation Joseph was rejected by his brothers and they said you will NE we would you will never rule over us and Jesus came came to his own and his own received him not Joseph wept when his brothers didn't recognize him Jesus wept when Jerusalem when over Jerusalem when Israel didn't recognize him as the Messiah Joseph suffered to save the very ones who betrayed him in silence they never knew who he was but yet he saved them Isaiah says of Jesus like a sheep being led to slaughter or a lamb that is silent before its shearers he did not open his mouth what a picture Joseph was betrayed by Judah his own brother his own Kindred for 20 pieces of silver Jesus was betrayed by Judas his brother in Christ his brother around him his disciple for 30 pieces of silver Joseph wears a coat of many colors which signifies royalty and they put a purple robe on Jesus to confess that he was he was Jesus and a crown of thorns upon his head Joseph goes down into a pit into Egypt down into a prison and you look in the Book of Psalms David describes this pit and I want you to listen how David describes the pit that Joseph was in he says that pit was as death hell and the grave Jesus went down into the grave but on the third day he conquered death hell and the grave he rose again Joseph is alive Jesus is Alive the two were going hand in hand Joseph got a gentile wife Jesus has a gentile bride this is good Joseph began his ministry at the age of 30 Jesus begins his ministry at the age of 30 listen to this this is the one I think is one of the greatest the world came to Joseph to be saved and there is salvation and no other name but the name of Jesus Christ do you realize the world would have died would have dried up and died had Joseph not have stored up and stored up and stored up but God had a plan for Joseph he was telling him you will be my type of Christ to the bride you will show the bride who she is so it's clear as we see this and as we look into the scripture reading tonight the life of Joseph is an amazing story of the power of almighty God and we look at this we see Joseph set suffering in a prison we see him set suffering in a prison down in the palace and Pharaoh we know has a dream and pharaoh has this dream that he cannot interpret but Joseph was remembered you remember there was a guy that said Remember Me Joseph was remembered and they called Joseph up and Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dream and Pharaoh does what he looks at Joseph and said there is none like you in the land I don't know your God I don't know exactly what you believe but one thing I know about you the spirit that is within you and the spirit that you commune with is one like I've never seen before I exalt thee Joseph I'm going to elevate you Joseph so here Joseph goes from a prison are you with me from a prison house and now he's been elevated up into into a position and the first thing that he was was given was what a bride did you realize that in the scriptures when you're reading that do you realize the first thing he was given was a gentile bride a gift from the father soon after that we see that Joseph has a family and Joseph's family is born in Egypt and Joseph's Gentile bride we can see now types the Bride of Jesus Christ and over in the Book of Genesis I want I want going to look at a couple of people tonight we're going to look at Rebecca we're going to look at Rebecca who is a picture of the calling of the Bride of Jesus Christ or the called out bride of Jesus Christ and we're going to look at asenath who is a picture of the coronation or the crowning of a queen of a king you realize there's going to be a crown there's going to be a Queen of Heaven I'm looking at her I said I'm looking at her there's going to be a queen that will sit right at the throne at the very Throne of Jesus Christ a redeemed bride a gentile bride that he come down for and said I'm going to take you home so let's look at her you say h h how can this woman be that bride well we'll see some types that may match up some of our Lives whether we like it or not asath the woman that was received as the bride she was raised worshiping false gods she was raised worshiping Idols you place your idol there football basketball women men alcohol whatever so she is raised worshiping these false pagan gods and asenath is clueless to to the god of Abraham she's clueless to the god of Abraham Jacob and Joseph she do even aware of God knew nothing about him but the good thing about it was God knew her you see you may have been living in a place that you knew nothing about God you knew nothing about the message of the hour but God knew who you were I said God knew who you were tonight he know you wasn't going to be content living in Egypt you would not be content living in the secular world it's not in you she's a picture of lost Humanity but then we can take it right to the scripture in Ephesians and Ephesian tells us that that he ha quickened those that were dead in trespasses and sin that's us he quickened where in time pass walking according to the course of what this world I think every about every one of us sitting here could say we've walked the course of this world we're no different than anybody else that comeing to this world speaking lies we were all a bunch of liars cheaters thieves greed jealous walking into this course of this world according to the prince of the power of this air you mean we were given over to Satan absolutely if you were living that life you were living the life of one of Satan's Children thank God we wouldn't adopted into that family that was just a foster home you were just there till something came along that would love you and nurture you and pull you in and protect you and keep you and watch over you the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedient among who also we had our conversations in time pass with the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh yeah that's what it says we were by Nature the children of Wrath asath an Egyptian serving Egyptians serving the gods of Egypt but God you you know what it says but God who is rich in Mercy but God who was rich in Mercy for asenath God who was rich in Mercy for you God who was rich in Mercy for I that God that very God he loved us so much he loved us so much that even when we were dead in our sins he have quickened us together with Christ he's raised us up together and made made us to set in Heavenly places with Joseph oh that's not what it said is it in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus so you mean to tell me that he picked us up when you were lifeless he cares so much that he looked at you and he picked you up when you were lifeless and he set you down in the highest of Heavens in the company of Jesus what a oh what a savior we ought to sing from the rooftops because it says We Were Strangers from the covenants of promise we didn't even know the word we didn't know a promise of Jesus we knew not a promise of Salvation having no hope let me tell you the life I was living was a life of no hope it was a life of of Disobedience it was a life without God but he drew us nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ so this is just a reminder of what what we were before the Lord Jesus Christ this is what asenath was before she met Joseph this was the kind of life she lived but it all have to come the same way through a repentant heart through the blood of Jesus Christ she came to Joseph we came to Jesus that blood had began to blot out the sins of Our Lives because something spoke to us in our hearts and there was a repentance made on the inside that said I can't live like this anymore this is not who I am asenath looked at this and said I can't be a queen the way I live oh Joseph you got the ring you got the robe you got the authority but I'm not worthy but because of the blood but because of the blood there's a bumper between us and heaven and Jesus stands in the Gap and that our sins go up and they hit the bumper and they fall back into what the Sea of God's forgetfulness I want you to know something when Joseph got out of that prison when Joseph got out of that prison prison and he was promoted to to a position of power and authority and majesty and that sounds like a great thing right we're talking about our Jesus that's a great thing we know he's the power The Authority the the King of Kings the Lord of lords but what what happened to Asen oh you got quiet as Joseph was elevated she was elevated the higher he got the higher she got are you with me are you with me so the more we lift up the name of Jesus the more you're lifted up the more we praise the almighty God the more you're lifted up the more we sing the songs of Zion the more we're lifted up you say well I'm singing to God but it's lifting up his bride because she identifies in who she is the more you think on Heavenly things the more you'll find yourself in Heavenly places asth now finds herself as the bride of the most powerful man in the entire world do you realize that you mean I'm the Bride of the most powerful man in the entire world sometimes we fail to realize that we fail to give credit where credit is due and she now sits there as the most uh as the Bride of the of the most powerful man in the entire world he's got the ring he's got the robe he's got people bowing down they obey his every word so let me ask you this was she Fit For A King after something got a hold of her life in the beginning she wasn't in herself she wasn't in the old Asin she wasn't on her own she wasn't it was not an honor that she could achieve on her own and you and I would never achieve it on our own that's why we have to have the Holy Ghost and Fire Burning in our souls it's the Holy Ghost in fire that's keeping me alive it's not myself I fail in myself I fall short in myself I have hatred in myself yeah I'm being honest with you you be honest with yourself but it wasn't something she achieved on her own but the thing about it she had no choice in the matter do you realize she had no choice in the matter she had no choice in the matter Michael John because she was a chosen Bride for Joseph you and I have no choice in the matter because we are a chosen Bride for Jesus Christ [Applause] when you're chosen it don't matter what you think brothers and sisters this is a picture of the bride and the father's gift John says henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for the all things that I have heard of my father have made known unto you you have not chosen me but I chose you I ordained you what is an ordination an ordination is when you give somebody the authority to do something on the behalf of when you ordain a minister you say this person is ordained to preach the word of God and he says I'm ordaining you the bride of Christ to be my representation on the earth while I'm not here so why are we living the way we do we should live a higher standard he saves us he elevates us he changes our lives he fills us with the Holy Ghost Joseph was given the name zaniah panah by Pharaoh do you know what that means in Egyptian I'm GNA tell you write this down zephan panah I'm not going to spell it for you you have to look it up it means in Egyptian savior of the world and in Hebrew it means one who reveals Mysteries wow one who reveals Mysteries I can't help but imagine the conversation that asan and Joseph must have had I can't help but imagine how they might have been laying in a field together hand in hand telling each other how much they loved each other how thankful she was to have met him and to come in contact and to be chosen as his bride and I can imagine as I hear her say tell me about our God tell me about our God you know she had no knowledge tell me about our God tell me about the Garden of Eden again Joseph tell me how God came down and he created a garden and a domain for Adam and Eve and they run it and and it was a perfect paradise and how how our God would come down in the cool of the evening and speak to him tell me about that Joseph tell me about how when they made a mistake and they fell God promised a way back give me hope Joseph give me give me some Assurance Joseph tell me how that he done that tell me how that there was a sacrifice made tell me Joseph about a great flood that happened because God was angered with the way the world was going but there was a man named Noah who preached for 120 years tell me about it Joseph I want to know how God moved tell me about how he promised with a with a rainbow in the sky that he would never never flood the Earth again tell me how he loves us Joseph tell me how he promised Abraham descendants tell me how he turned Abraham and Sarah into young people that they were unrecognizable tell me how he made her so beautiful Joseph that the people desired her a 90-year-old woman they desired her for relationship tell me Joseph how does God do that tell me about it tell me about the offering of Isaac tell me about when when God come down and he said it's either you and me or you and Isaac which is it you see brothers and sister Joseph literally became the bread of life to a gentile po population he became a the bread of life to his own people and as the daughter of potier sat on the throne by his side and loved him with all of her heart so was she Fit For A King I think so brother Brandon said Remember The Bride is a gentile he'll come and take people out of the Gentile for his what his name's sake MS Jesus Christ that's what a namesake is we no longer carry the name of this Earthly body but we carry a name of Mrs Jesus Christ he said you know he said there's many a young lady in the world he said but I've taken one woman she was meet a broy and he said but now she's no longer a Bry now she's Mrs will brandom so can we say we're Mrs Jesus Christ he says that's how it is you take on Jesus Christ and become bride members of the Bride what a place to be in you mean there's no more wickedness in you not as a bride there's no more there's no more anger there's no more uh wickedness and and anger and jealousy and strife not in the bride oh this flesh may rise up from time to time oh Egypt may try to come calling but I said at the Throne of Joseph I said at the Throne of Jesus Christ I don't want no part of Egypt anymore Egypt is a thing of the past I'm seeing the future let's talk about Rebecca for just just a minute Rebecca her life began in a way it seemed ordinary you see there's different roads some people don't know nothing some people raised in the church J raised in a in a in a church home message home some people like Asen I knew nothing of God but here's Rebecca who was raised into a into a a house that knew something about the word of God who who worshiped a God she didn't worship gods of the world but to her this was just an ordinary life and Rebecca grew up to be a a a real beautiful woman she was Spirited but in her beauty and in her spirit she kept her moral pure she kept herself her family just to lay a background her family was prosperous they were prosperous enough that they had servants but yet she wasn't uh coddled and treated like a princess she was raised to work hard she was raised to go out in the house and to fetch water for the family every evening she would have to go out and Hoist the vessel this Clay Pot a lot of times we hear the story we think well she's packing some five gallon buckets no no no no she's packing maybe a three gallon four gallon clay pot that's maybe an inch and a half thick throwing it up on her shoulders to go fetch enough water to get the family through and one evening she's out filling her pot she's out here filling her jar and this elderly man runs up to meet her now put yourself young ladies in that scene scenario you're minding your own business you're filling your water and some old man comes dirty filthy remember he's been on a wagon on a on a camel train stinking 3 week Journey 500 Miles Dusty dirty filthy stinky and he comes running up to her and says hey can can you give me a sip of water from your jar put yourself there I probably drop a pot and run myself but she looks at him and she says this man has traveled so far I can tell by the way he looks so she swings her water pot down from her shoulder and she gives the man a drink not just a mere sip not just enough to wet his whistle no she says here you drink and have fresh water cool water drink until you're satisfied and she begins to let him have it and and she's looking she looks around while he's guzzling through this pot can you imagine him guzzling through this pot and she looks around and she says there's a train of 10 camels but the trough is empty eleazer is looking for someone who's Fit For A King he's got his eyes on this young lady to see if she is Fit For A King and he look she's looking around and she sees that the camels hasn't been tended to and she's looking and she sees his kind eyes watching her attentively brothers and sisters brother brandham said that she that he was watching for the sign over her do you realize you were under a sign there was a cloud in Arizona the head of Christ are we are we in agreeance with that over the body the Bride of Jesus Christ you were under a sign and he said the prophet said he was looking and watching for the sign over there because listen there could have been thousands of young ladies around there that would have loved to have went but he being a servant a messenger from Abraham he took his job very serious he couldn't go out and just gather and grab the first woman of the world and take her back and say here you go no that wasn't what he was looking for no that wasn't what he was looking for but Ellie easier being the servant the messenger of Abraham was committed to gather a bride Fit For A King brothers and sisters our Prophet was a messenger servant who took his job serious who come and and he used and he began to spread the message and spread the word and open the word of Jesus Christ open the word of God to try to find a bride that was Fit For A King he was looking for character she wanted to be as generous as she would now in the Bible I'm going through some scriptures here but you can look them up it's in Genesis 24 if you want to read the story later but he goes in there and and and he's watching and and and and Rebecca wants to be as generous as she could so she tells him I'll draw water for your camels to get them through no until they're done drinking do you realize what this what this young girl just said I'm going to draw water for your camels until they're done drinking this is in the evening time how many hours will this take to fill a trough with 250 gallons of water dipping it out of a clay jar drawing it from a a crank well filling a jar going and pouring it into a trough what kind of commitment did she have what kind of calling did she have in her life what kind of character was this woman made of she's willing to do whatever it takes to prove who she is elaser begins to notice his character two 50 gallons of water she's eager she's hospitable I liked it when brother B said the preachers say when they come here they they get treated so well much much better than they do at some other places that's Hospitality that's being hospitable to God's servants not that we treat them any different we treat everybody that way I hope every visitor feels like they have met people that really truly care and love and and want to see them excel in life and as the Bride of Jesus Christ she's running back and forth back and forth refilling filling refilling filling refilling filling this jar back and forth and I bet all the time elas you're saying praise the Lord praise the Lord he has heard my prayers my God has heard my cries thank you God for sending a bride because all these others were just looking and watching wonder who that man is and she's feeling and refilling feeling and refilling we live in an age brothers and sisters where selfishness Reigns yep it's all about self self-satisfaction self-gratification self-indulgence even parents are selfish on their children my my boy we could we could we could stop here for a while parents are selfish on their children let me tell you your children have to come oh high on the totem pole because if you don't raise your children right you've done nothing but set them up for failure if you don't take your kids to church I said take them not send them what are you showing that when you get my age it's okay to do whatever you want we're off topic selfishness Reigns Supreme lovers of themselves un willing to go out of their way for others that's what the Bible says lovers of pleasure lovers of themselves but here is Rebecca noticing this eleazar's gaze upon her and he's looking in amazement and wonder and joy and Rebecca finally gets done and he comes up to Rebecca and he says here I want you to have this these and he gives her bracelets and he gives her a nose ring that don't give you permission to get a nose ring young girls it was culture it was custom not today but the nose ring signified that this woman would be engaged and he hands her these bracelets now I want you to watch this these bracelets were valued at around $88,000 what do you think look at the look on her face she's like my goodness where's he been all my life $88,000 and he puts these bracelets on her now let me ask you this were those gifts from elaser no could a servant give away such valuable possessions as $8,000 bracelets gold rings jewelry finest of jewelry a servant couldn't do that no brothers and sisters the gifts were from the master's house the gifts were from the master's house the servant just carried the gifts to the future bride and that's the way it is in our hour brothers and sisters brother brandom's Ministry weren't gifts that he could give that were his no they were gifts that God had given him it was a Ministry that God had given him for who the future bride of [Applause] Christ yeah he said let me ask you who's daughter are you can you imagine elaser had never seen such a worker hadn't never seen such a commitment to a stranger whose daughter are you is there any room in your father's house for us to spend the night might and then she told him of who her family was and his Joy intensified that's blood relatives that's exactly who I'm looking for you've done exactly what I've asked we've got a lot of we got a lot of straw we got a lot of fod we got enough for everybody everybody in your whole Entourage to stay the night thank you Lord elaser he had to just be bubble he had to be about to explode with joy cuz his biggest fear what was it he told him when he left what if I can't find somebody worthy what am I to do my Lord what am I to do if I can't find the bride for Isaac so Rebecca brings him into the house they go on about their business and they're being in hospitable and he enters into the to the house of bethu Rebecca's father and the host offers him a meal but he's too excited to eat he's too overwhelmed with joy to eat and he looks at him and he says let me just let me tell you why I'm here you won't believe this you won't believe what has just happened I I've been sent by Abraham I've been sent sent to come and find a a bride for his son Isaac and I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and I prayed that she would come and offer me water I prayed that she would offer the to to water my camels I prayed that she would come in there and I would find out that she would be blood relatives not of this world but a pure lineage of Isaac not taken by the world and I prayed and I prayed Elie eer goes on to to tell them all the specifics and how precise things begin to take place and he says as I sat there thirsty and dry and dirty your daughter comes up to me and offers me a drink then she proceeds precisely to water my camels one after one gallon two gallon 25 gallon 100 gallon two 200 gallon 250 gallons of water she packed on her shoulders to water my camels let me tell you this only could be from God but let me tell you this brothers and sisters I believe God was working on both ends Not only was God hearing what eleazer was saying but God was speaking to a bride and she was responding to the word that was being said go go give this man drink go water his camels he is a relative of yours invite him to your house what young girl in her right mind would do these things without the leadership of God Almighty Elie are praying Rebecca's listening and speaking so they were moved bethu looks at this and he says you know what this has to be none other than God Almighty moving our situation moving in the scene give us 10 days to think about this oh no no no she's got to come back with me in the morning now what you thinking he give you bracelets now you're leaving 500 miles from Mama and Daddy you that ain't sounding so good now is it come with me leaving in the morning no no no let's let's just see what she has to say about it so they bring her in and they begin to talk and they we come to the crossroad of Rebecca's life what would she say what would she would she play on the sympathy of her father and her brother pleading please just just stay here just stay here Rebecca you know that's kind of the way the world pulls at us just just just stay stay on the fringes just stay here he'll come back for you you don't have to go you don't have to be submissive you don't have to to give up the things of of of our life here that's what the pull that she was getting would she be willing to go on this unknown Journey would she view it as a privilege with the events that had taken place around her clearly knowing this was Jehovah I can imagine as they P her do you want to stay here Rebecca I can imagine with her attitude with her commitment to God to Jehovah I imagine she looked at her dad and her brother and said what are you talking about what is there to discuss I have been called I have been chosen God has spoken through him God has spoken to me God has offered me this that something that all the other girls in the city would love to have but God gave it to me Beth's family blessed their beloved Rebecca and her childhood nurse Deborah and some of her servant girls pack up their bags and head off with eleazer how many of you Mama going to let that happen they pack up their bags and begin to head away as they're going down the road this journey of 500 Miles 500 miles on a camel not a horse camel you ever seen one of them you ever seen the way they walk it ain't pretty I can't even mimic it I won't even attempt to but here you think about Rebecca this poor young girl she probably seen plenty of camels in her life but you know she probably wasn't an experienced Camel Rider her family was Shepherd people and they say riding a camel is one of the most torturous things until you're conditioned to it and so here she goes now on this 500 100 mile Journey up and down up and down but Rebecca looked forward she kept looking ahead she kept looking to see what the promises was she kept looking trying to learn all she could from elaser about Isaac and about his family and she began to to picture the old man talking to her just just picture the old man talking to her by the campfire when they would stop to rest and there she sits at the campfire she begins to talk elaser tell me about him tell me about what I'm getting myself into tell me about who will be the love of my life tell me what he looks like tell me tell me how he talks tell me how he prays tell me what kind of man he is no doubt she just wanted more and more and more and finally after days of travel the Caravan begins to to come into the and into the Twilight of the evening and the fall of the land and and Rebecca looks at there she sees a man walking in the fields and the Bible says she got off quickly she didn't I bet she was tired to get off that Camel let me off of this thing she didn't wait for him to stop you see them camels you know they get down on one knee and then the other knee and then they no she just bailed off this thing said who is this man in the field I see coming and eleazer looks at her and says that's your lord and she veils herself out of respect for her new husband and she fails herself and she comes running up to Isaac and she comes rning running up to him and she says who are you my name is Rebecca I'm Isaac nice to meet you you're so beautiful you're more than I ever imagined you're sweeter than I could ever think your beauty is uncomparable this is what God is saying about us this is the way that God that Jesus Christ looks at his bride you're so beautiful you're duty is uncomparable you marry me and it said she as she hastily got off that they went into the camp and went into his mother's tent and they knew each other and was married the Bride of Jesus Christ you know Isaac was a man of about 40 years grieving for his mother who had died about three years earlier and now he's got this wife who is committed who's caring who's hospitable who's decent who's moral who loves God was she Fit For A King let's stand to our feet tonight you see it don't matter which road you you come down maybe you come the way asath did maybe your life was similar to Rebecca's but one thing about it no matter which road you came you were chosen you were chosen by God Almighty to be the bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ how many would say Lord make me an Asin knife who loves my Joseph make me a Rebecca who loves my Isaac make me the Bride of Jesus Christ that pours out my heart in a greater way than I've ever poured out my heart before to my Lord Jesus Christ God Almighty boy I love him
