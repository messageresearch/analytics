========================================

I don't know if we have it we probably don't but amen I I guess way back time I remember it back when I was Mennonite I guess I heard whoa words beautiful words wonderful words of life amen there's a song about the wonderful words of life amen and so we come to church to have eight words that are alive their spirit and they are life amen praise the Lord originally when I began to think about this I begin to think about how that uh brother Branham he mentions now I think he even mentions brother Brian or brother Bosworth expressing this and you'll see it here so I'll start with this now here's now he's more willing to do it than you are to receive it see uh could you imagine brother Bosworth expressing this to this ocean out here piled up in one tube about two foot high or about two foot across he says in other words the whole Ocean's out there and then you have a pike about two foot wide two foot across he says what a pressure there would be trying to get down into that little kravis Amen to leak through now divide that by ten thousand times and you'll find the pressure of the Holy Spirit trying to find that little crevice in the heart amen that true Faith to leak in there and to heal you now I know no matter what the promises of God are God is more willing and Desiring to give it to us than what we are to receive it and before the service is over tonight by the help of the Lord I want to show you I want to tell you how you can get more because that's what I want to talk about a little bit I mean how that we can take that two foot or whatever crack or whatever crevice you might just have a little little bit of Faith whatever it is and that we can expand the reception of being able to receive more of God because how many we've got untapped resources amen there's like a whole ocean up there and he's trying God is trying boy we need to get this he's trying to get into you more he's trying to get into me more amen and we're gonna find out by the end of the service how to do that how can we again get more amen praise the Lord oh my when I think about it okay so now notice and he goes on to talking about he says you know like somebody came and told him he says uh people tell me he says you know I would ask God to heal me but you know he's so busy then by the band says my could you imagine the little fish about ye long out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean saying now I better just drink this water sparingly amen or I might run out someday this has a hahaha there that's right that's just as intelligent thinking that you could ever exhaust God's goodness to you amen could you imagine little mouse down there under the big old grains Garner Egypt saying I just better eat two grains a day it might not last through the winter Oh my he wants you to ask abundantly so your Joys might be full amen don't be afraid to ask God for anything he's willing more willing to give it than you are to receive it now I'm going to show you also in what ways we're not willing to receive it is that okay so don't let me forget because I'm forgetful amen praise the Lord another one just to start with well let me finish this one first so he thought he's more willing to give it now so now notice right after this right after that the next quote he says so God has a way for us God loves his children he loves his people he wants to help him he wants to help you more than you want help if you can just get that in your heart that God's more willing to help you than you are to help yourself his Lord help us right don't you just be like oh my goodness he's more willing to help me and I'm willing to help myself I thought I was pretty willing to help myself I don't understand it I don't care but that's what he said and perhaps what I tell you later on and what keeps us from God and so forth will also tie into this to where we're not just so willing to let God help us amen all right praise the Lord so now notice more willing than you are to help yourself but he has a way and that's the only way that he'll work is through his way you must come to his terms his terms you wanted a certain way but he wants to give it to you his way amen dipping in Jordan remember you told him to go dipping money this ain't there enough around here that I can dip around here without to the Papa told him and his servant said now if he'd ask you a hard thing you'd have done that right but it just asked you a simple thing going dead and he went and he did what the prophet said how many knows he could have dipped in a dozen of them he'd never got cleansed to leprosy never foreign you can try all kinds of ways but you'll never get it until you come this way till you come guys what's the only way God won't compromise for you amen that's the way you come that way or you don't come praise be to God all people have tried it every other way they climb up some other way the Bible says amen all right now notice so he had to obey and come God's way and when he fully obeyed God's way the leprosy left and I say tonight that if we obey God's provided way leprosy will sickness will leave everything will leave everything let me know it doesn't matter what you have need of whatever you desire ask if you believe with all of your heart come the right way and then there'll be a finished work oh my but we've got to come his way for this day amen praise the Lord now notice Brother Band says another thing about an eagle he's a special bird because he will never build his nest on the ground he built it his nest way higher he Likens that to his church you are a city that sits on a hill not in the valley you're a city that sits on a hill that can be seen a fire off and lighted candle that can be seen far off the church is setting high with high expectations High ambitions amen how many knows that somebody that doesn't have very high Ambitions in this life won't get very far man you got to work in slave and hard you got to have some Ambitions if you're going to get anywhere a lot of people will just well just whatever [Music] let me tell you something when you're looking for a boy when you're looking for a girl you better have some expectations from them are you going to get somebody that ain't no good have some expectations have some high expectations amen brother says I haven't gotten much hopes for a pastor's church that has got high got Ambitions to better themselves day by day year by year let me believe that's what it's all about that's right a church that's really a Church of the Living God will never just stop and say like I said a couple weeks ago well I'm at a certain Plateau I guess that's just where I'll stay huh never just stop and say well I just come in I guess it's all right now that ain't the Church of God You've Got High oh my you might say I've done my part I brought one sinner in last year he got saved brother that's not the ambition of the church that's been another one and then another one another then another then another that's right to it praise be to God High Ambitions the better ourselves that's what we're here for tonight to see how we can better ourselves not staying in the same place growing higher and higher and higher all right let's go to the quote where I wanted to start now this is an invisible Union of Christ in the bride and it was after I read about you're Washed by the bleeding word you're the Spotless sinless bride of Jesus Christ and he makes a statement you're perfect amen then after that he says something that I didn't get to the other day and I wanted to get to that we're going to go from here nine closing I might say this that we know that the modern Church Pentecostal in its present condition and all the denominations together I throw them all in one one bundle because they are amen and we know where the bundles are going all right you know where the bundles are going again the next statement the next next uh uh quote he says that almost three or four times we all know 39 5 if it goes the same way it does here we all know that the modern Church in its present condition and its state is in no condition to finish up the Great Commission that God gave his church my title tonight is finishing the commission finishing the commission amen they can't yeah Instagram Great Commission [Laughter] he just got finished saying we all know that the modern Church and pick also in his present condition and all the nominations I throw them all they can't never meet the conditions you see brother banham I mean no he turned a corner in 1963. there was a time when he sent him into there send them into there there was a time when he could get out of there you can't belong to one of them churches and be the Bride of Jesus Christ just in case anybody's wondering right you can't be the Bride of Jesus Christ and belong to one of the man-made denominations you can't never finish up the commission and that some of those things I wanna look at what that commission is and so forth now we know all right now notice notice how it says they're in Ephesians here we come all to the unity of the faith is that right and to the knowledge of the Son of God until there's under United and wonder under one hit and so forth one Lord One Faith one baptism he said we've got one that's two in the three in this first fight this one's this and that one's out and every one of them afraid to face the word right down to the test amen you can tell them about it and they say I can't help but I can't believe it I don't care what it does amen people said well I don't believe that even though the Bible says it well that you just put yourself out my own church don't teach this or that or the other amen my goodness now we know again he says it now we know that the church depending calls the church by no means oh means could carry out and he says it and the reason I'm saying it again because he says it's a little bit different by no means could carry out the Last Day message amen The Last Day message in its present condition not good no why can't you see denominations out that's right and it's going to be it's going to be elected people that's elected for it aren't you glad that you can believe the message of the hour if you're a message believer amen that put you in the category of being able to finish out this commission and no and so every one of us know that the whole rank of denominations Clinic Apostles and all are dead and he was talking to me Born Again Christians of the message Gotta Die out to all of that to be a message believer is that the truth that's why I see your first husband's dead you know he said God let it die I mean we got to die to that old thing I do traditions of man and so forth that never even what it's man-made Creeds mod man-made dogmas they can't never fulfill the scripture where it says man shall not live but right alone but by every word that proceed is out of the mouth of God no they add to it they can't fulfill Rebel that they actually do fulfill Revelations where it says don't you add one word to it or take one word away they add to it they fulfill that part oh my dick cat uh they can't fulfill Ephesians 5 and 26 and 27 where he's coming for a bride for a church that's washed that's without spot and that's without Regal they have homosexual preachers they're filthy they're dirty they're a bunch of prostitutes they can't fulfill that God's gonna have a church without spots they'll never be able to do that oh my they can't fulfill Malachi 4 do you send Elijah to the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn to Hearts of the father to the children and also our hearts back to the faith of the apostolic fathers they can't fulfill that they don't even believe the message how are they ever gonna be turned back cause I'll tell you right now it is about being ready for the Rapture if you're not going to be you're either ready or you're not ready and that's what we're here for get ready they'll never be ready they turn down the very thing that would have got ready would have got them ready amen praise the Lord oh my but what are they fulfilling there are all kinds of man's creep s and darkness isn't that right there's amen they're just they can make a church out of any kind of an idea they want to not a challenge you're coming out of damage no other day Megan it's not a denomination another somebody's idea one church is getting together a group upon these people they don't have a preacher every every man takes his turn and talking I guess preaching amen that would be different doesn't it all right we're gonna happen to John next Sunday we're gonna have another John next Sunday amen we have everybody up there talking ain't called to be a preacher might be able to talk anybody can talk it's a different thing never fulfill I'll tell you what they're fulfilled like they fulfill the scripture where they had him on Revelations and through chapter 8 but I would stand at the door knocked that's what they're fulfilling no wonder he could say that they don't never be able to make a Rapture they'll never be ever ready for a body change can't never fulfill the promise he can't that the commission for this hour praise the Lord let me know somebody will but he's going to fulfill the commission of this hour and that is to have a pride that's ready a people that's been washed in the blood oh my I like it Mr brother man just got preaching Amen to the Bride of Jesus Christ and even in Shalom uh to the bride I say peace peace and so forth here he's talking about if you're believing every word every God every Tittle you are standing I know you've never done it in the first place you're the Spotless Body of Christ the message shall bring that um sure he will oh my let's slow down and go back a little bit let's pick this up a little bit about growth how many of these were growing up into Christ I want more of Jesus more and more and more amen now notice he says now you don't have to die to get this you have to spiritually die out but you don't have to physically die the inside is where God gets in to control you amen how many at least that's what's going on he presses man again just get all the meanness the Superstition and all the unbelief out of you and every time you move out a little bit of unbelief God steps right up there and he takes over move over move out unbelief like Joshua carry where the souls of your feet said that have I given to you tonight as we enter into the kingdom of God God's kingdom take out all the Philistines unbelievers all the amalekites all of the amorites and whatever throw it all out like that we take possession they say well the days of Miracles has passed you Amorite get out of me amen I put it print there I've took over there's no such a thing as seeing missions get out of there you are Malachi I'm coming over there you are you're pressing out from that little button is taking over the fibers of you spreading out God working through you and in you and around you how many that's what's happening to the people in this generation oh I like that praise the Lord in Ephesians 6 it said it this way hmm but there it is there's one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all praise be to God aren't you glad for that amen so it's God working in his pride how are they ever going to fulfill the part where there's going to be a messiah how many believe that the church of living on this age is a messiah your Miss Jesus Christ amen now notice from a little button taking over next paragraph no wonder Elijah in his body upon that dead baby and it comes alive it was God in the man God had took over he was anointed Jesus said he was every prophet of God in the Old Testament was anointed with the Holy Ghost they were they were the Lesser lights he was the fullness of God being Messiah he says they was Messiah it's then smaller Messiahs and they were Anointed with the same spirit that he was anointed with only he had it in his fullness and every man today that's received a true baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a Anointed with the same spirit that loved to come to church instead of them you know amen and listen to a preacher that anointed by the Holy Ghost and they really just preach the word of God oh we just enjoy it don't we but amen I want you to understand something man I'll tell you what what would happen by the time what would happen amen if anybody got his anointed as the preacher did they would just read that every Son of God everybody that's got the Holy Ghost the man has that same anointing that Jesus had we're all to be anointed once not false anointed at once but real anointed ones we bring the anointing I mean that's when you come to church you bring something with you you bring an attitude with you you bring a spirit you bring an aura about you you need to bring more of that liquor fire or you bring a wet wreck come on people think about it I'm here to tell you whoa oh we could just have an altar call right now how many we need more anointing we just need my idea the preacher sure does are you gonna have a dancer Sherman that's you sure do amen I like that I had to underline that is that okay it's right there praise the Lord that's the kind of food that we eat that changes us oh my aren't you glad for that now notice that's right oh now notice he went about doing good and Healing The Sick that makes me feel good to know that he lives today there's something about a man he is a God he was made to be a god his purpose here on Earth was to be a god to have dominion over everything in the Earth folks I'm here today aren't you glad that when you conquer the devil you rule over the Devils you rule over your flesh you rule over a depression you ruled over all kinds of things I said to Adam use yard to have dominion over the fish of the sea over there there's something in us there's something in all of humanity that's groaning and then we realize that we aren't supposed to have to go to work every day we should be able to speak the word regardless there's something groaning in US we build a better house and a better house we want a better disabilities because we want perfection we want to build a big retirement so that we can take it easy and enjoy life a little but guess what you'll never really get to enjoy it to you oh amen made to be a God he says amen I believe it's the seals not the seals but he's true Easter seal have dominion over everything in the earth oh my now don't let that stagger you because I got some scripts like God and Aaron you'll be his prophet that's right the prophets you call them gods so why you stagger so much when I say I'm the son of God amen here the other night I saw a telecast of a man with spiky mental faith it's a wonder sit back and kept concentrating on that glass of water till it bursted to that just by concentration watching that glass of water and the glass of rotted water that glass cracked and the water ran out just pure mental consciousness concentration why that's his fibers that's his makeup I wanted to find it but he says you know man what was made to have he was made to be able to do that now notice if he can do that got the power in him by mental thinking that he can break a glass of water and him being a sinner that shows that there is something made in that man this is where I got myself oh my there's something in US isn't it that calls for being able to speak to the storms speak to things we weren't made to cry made to speak likewise feet can go forward Moses it shows there's something made in him to be like that one he's a fallen perverted condition but if that man can only get back to God and let God get into him with that power turned loose in the kingdom of God amen praise the Lord he didn't have what it was he didn't have no conduct doctor he was like a shotgun he just splattered every way but if that if that Spirit that's in a man could be converted and put Christ in there or he's got a conductor a conductor is a wire that conducts it amen let and let a man with that same Faith do not conduct her in the word of God he can raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out Devils amen passion like unto God looks like God sure what that's reading God was it was the man because man was gone and that's his offsprings I thought about that you know you talk about a receptacle listen how many knows there's a left are you receptacle like Amen in that receptacle there's a wire that comes to that when you plug it into there guess what you got power you and I are the wire you and I are the conductor we're the liar but it takes thought to power that water when we lay our hands on the set the honor recover we're not just flattering here now that when we lay our hands on you you ought to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen not just the glass and just shoot it out there but pinpoint now Devil's all these disease now not you got to go in the name of the Lord that's what God's made his children to be a conductor he's the power I am the vine ye are the branches isn't that right oh man if an unconverted person can do that what should you and I do that are connected to Jesus Christ amen praise be to God Hallelujah Say Amen a conductor now notice when we get born again what happens let's look at this growing let's talk about growing into the resurrection because how many beliefs there's a Time coming where headed Towers fulfilling the one scripture where it says we which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which are asleep come into that place that the Bible talks where God is in control amen not like this now notice it's the earnest amen let me make sure I got them all oh my that's right passed over some of that maybe we'll pick it up notice the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your Resurrection when you receive the Holy Ghost is then dwelling in you the potential of it you are now on your way growing to the full Resurrection how many believe that a tree dust doesn't come up overnight blows into it amen I'll tell you what I've listened to a lot of preachers lately now I'm amazed at the things that people are preaching now compared to 15 years ago even thank you amen you can't go higher than the pastor then the pastor has to go up somehow yeah right you got to go a little higher church is ever going to come higher the five-fold minutes you're going to come higher in the UC I see I I I dig into things like this and I dig things out that I ain't never noticed really before to try to bring it out and feed to the people amen how many believes there's rapturing faith in there there's a body change laying there there's power for you to live above sin day after day after day after day amen praise be to God now notice that's right so he says now he's talking about a Grove he was actually talking about uh Martin Luther how did he grow from Grace if not it was the baptism of the Holy Spirit now as the Pentecostal Church baptized into the Holy Ghost it's been growing limbs that died got pruned off and so filled but the Stills the trees still growing it's going on and you're led by the spirit the Quicken the word to you who believes it the word keeps quickening as you come to the first slip second limb third limb on top it just keeps on quickening now God gave Abraham him a promise Abraham believed God and he was imputed unto them for righteousness and he was sealed notice he was sealed that Covenant by the Seal of circumcision and when God gives you the promise potentially you have received it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end but you see you've got to get a clearance of the deed I didn't really get into some of those things but how many notes whenever you go to buying a piece of property amen they do a title search they do a title search so that when you get the D we get the abstract deed and then it's all cleared so that it's all yours there's no liens against nothing else amen now notice now clearance interact do it you've got to see all this it's yours everything on it belongs to you how many believes everything on that belongs to you when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost this whole book is yours hahaha God help us to open up that valve a little bit more Lord give me a little more give me a little more Hallelujah I know this he's got a Clinton today the abstract there's your seal it's yours and when we believed on Jesus Christ as our savior and repent and baptized and come up to believe in him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract the abstract is the Assurance it's the guarantee thing that was ever held against the prop ER property has been fraction hahaha how many times that when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and you you are quickened it means that God Amen is going to Quicken you one day even to a body change it's your assurance I'm just glad for that and it also means and as we've heard many times that the second that a person genuinely repents of their sins and believes on the Lord Jesus Christ if you genuinely do that God is obligated to give you the baptism right there we've always hollowed so many our times heard the story or the brother ban him he says you know that if you do get the Holy Ghost it shows that God accepted your sacrifice he accepted your sacrifice but this is something a little bit deeper than just accepting your sacrifice or whatever but it's a guarantee he talks about that it's a guarantee the property has been bought Amen Let somebody try to take put you off the land when he says it belongs to you and you got the abstract in your hand let him try to do it there ain't no law in the land that can do it because you hold the abstract amen there's no devil no church no theology that could ever overstep the boundaries of God's proof and the abstract is the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized you into Christ Jesus and thus the surest he has raised up because potentially we have already raised with him the whole thing what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinion it changes our Notions and it sets our affections on things which are from above smoking drinking gambling and things that we used to do their dad different nature you've been crooked this quickly power brings your body into a raptured conditional already wow let me tell you whenever that happens and you come over come holiday thing I think let me breaks your body your body has to be in a rapturing condition before it takes the rapture you ain't gonna have all kinds of stuff hanging on you no how many bleeds it brings you into a Rapture condition oh my people say well I just can't quit this I can't quit that how many knows you need to get the canner in there the one that makes these cats all go away how can I open it up more how can I be ready as I said earlier I can have more of God I can open this thing up more so I can get more and I want to take it a little deeper if I can with the help of the Lord we've heard the saying and we know what brother bam said if you want to get closer to God is that right pray more read your Bible more hey man everybody said if you are you ought to be as a Christian you have to ask yourself how much are you praying how many sermons do you listen to in a day write it down get your buck how many sermons did you listen to between Sunday and Wednesday see church that you read [Music] five minutes I believe it's time to go to ten from 10 to 15 10 15 to an hour maybe two hours maybe three maybe four maybe five it's always right there because somebody knows when you planted in Christ it all depends I don't care what it is folks well I can't overcome this pay for me brother Byler you got to do more than get prayed for hey man just what do we teach people of how they're going to overcome something in themselves can they can they do it in themselves no what helps them overcome what causes them to overcome the power of the Holy Ghost nobody help me pray for me I don't want to be that way then get more to Holy Ghost this preacher is going to tell you what you need is more Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost will help you it'll cause you to overcome that I'll pray with you and I believe with you but if you kill God then do the same thing it ain't gonna change a thing the only way that you'll get the thing that you want from God is to get more of the Holy Ghost to have more faith than almighty God because I want you to know God Amen he wants us to have the kind of faith that we can speak to a mountain and be plucked up into the sea and it doesn't whatsoever things you desire when you believe him and ask believe that you'll have I can't do it no I can't you can't do it you've got to come to the junction it's no more I have to still be subject to this and subject to that no no it's time to Veer off and get into the world of possibility all things are possible the reason we don't I'm telling you now the reason we tell we die I guess it's the right word I don't know that we put the things that should be second to us are first to us your job your money your home your welfare often all things are first or tops and then God is second that's why you don't that's why we're not where we're ought to be listen to me here listen to me out there that's your problem you one more God read more but he said pray more you want to get closer to God you want more of his power that's the only thing you do amen set your affections on things above I mean please what are your passionists the problem is with our passion oh yeah our affectionate cowards what we treasure because what you treasure that's where your heart will be Lord thank God part of your soul and part of your strength and part of your mind he says Thou shalt love my Lord God thank God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy strength with all thy mind I wanted to close at 15 after but we're already past that turn the song with me if you will that was me Holy Spirit wants to go a little further is that right praise the Lord I mean I was David was quite the guy wasn't he David was quite the man and he said in Psalms he broke this way blessed is the man that woke up not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the Sinners nor sinners in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and then his law does he meditate once in a while a few minutes in the morning a few minutes in the afternoon no he meditate day and night pattern where is your meditation that's the problem we meditate even talk about the Lord a little more and I'll tell you what he comes around don't he want more of God's anointing how many knows we need more of his anointing it's what you feed on it's what you meditate on he told Joshua the same thing amen he says Thou this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein they they who was talking to him I guess God right that's right somebody was telling him that I guess it was probably I don't know who wrote Mo who wrote the Book of Joshua Book of Joshua perhaps I don't even know I guess it would be Joshua that wrote it but anyway we know it had to be God that said that to him so how many know who knows better than God or the angels of the Lord whatever Inspire him to write this amen praise the Lord all right read verse one and we'll have all of these questions that I just put out in front of you answered not after the death the Moses to serve the Lord speak unto jock I swear the son of nuns amen miss the Lord the Lord spoke to him meditate how many believe the Lord help us tonight meditate they and night that's how you'll get more of God that while we'll get more of the Heavenly sound here praise be to God you love him That's How we'll finish the commission because we're living in Iowa where the devil loves to take people's time he loves to take your time he loves for you to focus on other things than God amen you backslide I backslide when you get to not meditating on the Lord enough amen praise be to God you believe that meditate day and night how can I be a better Christian what is your passion amen ask yourself how much do you read the Bible how much do you how many sermons do you listen to how long do you pray how often do you pray Paul said that we ought to pray always amen lifting up holy hands and so forth now we need to meditate upon him think about him keep our minds on him brother Brian knows I know what it's like that if you really haven't studied and meditate on Sunday morning if you have a last minute crash course all right let me get in here let me let me find something let me let me do this huh praise to you to God I've had plenty of those times amen I wouldn't I want a difference in my preaching I don't want to preach like I used to amen you all be able to tell the difference used to I'd take half today Wednesday I'd work half today and then I take to about two o'clock and rest from my working and then I'd study let me tell you something nowadays my wife hopes you don't get mine but she want me to do something I had told her I would do something I said honey I did this and I'm going to home study and I'm not going to be bothered by anything anymore because if I don't cook nothing there won't be nothing to eat you know I like to take the whole day now not just the whole day tell you what usually if I'm getting to the place to where after after tonight I'll go home and all right what else large then the next day I'm listening I'm listening and he'll drop something in amen because I want to be fed I want you to be fed I need to meditate I don't even know how many home is with me we all need to meditate on God a lot more we need to listen to more servants sermons let me tell you something it's it's pretty crazy because we ain't got to go to Johnson City we ain't got to go to Vancouver we ain't got to go to Here There and Everywhere you've got it right here you can listen to it right there you can feed what did I have wrote down here I wasn't even gonna I guess the spirit brought it back to my tooth but uh you know we ought to eat so much Tommy until we are tighter than a tick I have dogs and them dogs love to go out there and get tick bit and them things little things they'll come back and they're just little bitty I look at a day or so later them things are ten times their size their legs are just smoking out of some little blah blah that's the thing tighter than a dick the Bible says let your soul Delight itself we ought to be fatter you'd have thought it why because I'm in a no I'm not talking about naturally we're trying to get rid of that I know that keep trying keep trying keep trying some of us succeed and I like what Brother Brad said I done lost a thousand pounds I caught that because I realized that's not what you know a lot of us do we will find it and then we'll lose it then we'll find it but let's not do that with the word let's find it and keep it shall we God bless you stand musicians if you'll come whether I want to grow into a resurrection I want this word to change me from glory to glory until my body is in the place that it is ready even in some of those quotes Barb talked about how that he's already quick in this this Mortal body has already been quickened into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus all it needs is for that thing to come down and change that body amen amen God bless you tonight amen amen I didn't have no song to sing with that so we'll let brother Joshua lead let's buy our heads how many was a brother Ballard that's really what I need I need to meditate on God more I need to pray I need to read more than what I do I hope those streaming out there to hear this realize that you have to do something different if you expect different results and this is what you got to do you got to take that secular everything that we do naturally and make it third or something it's not supposed to be first it's supposed to be second the third God is first you walk with God is first you'll walk different your affections your your whole makeup your whole personality everything will be different about you when you make sure that it's Christ before anything else and let's not just pray a little bit in the morning think about it everybody think about how much you pray and how much you meditate and see how guilty you are and say God take it away from me help me to meditate more on you Lord and just always have you in my Forefront God even this David said God help us to be that way father if he said that to those people back then I believe it's that way in this hour help us to meditate it on his shelf and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water that'll bring forth his fruit in his season God's sure we're going to see the real genuine fruit of the spirit the fruit of God coming forth out of our life when we truly meditate on it day and night and father our hands are all raised say Lord I'm guilty I'm sorry Father where I haven't meditated and Lord after this Wednesday night's service I'm going to go home and say God I come breaks to do what I just said is a consecration Lord and that's what we do tonight reconsecrate ourselves the folk listen to meditating to read and to feed on you Lord on the thing that you have already placed on the inside of us Lord and father we realize the Rapture is already in there lord it's all in there everything we have needed father but we need to feed it more we ask God that you'll help us do that in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you we love you amen God bless you Amen brother Joshua do we know um it's Jesus on the inside
