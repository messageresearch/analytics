[24:31] morning brothers and
[24:32] sisters if we'll just stand this
[24:37] morning maybe brother John Wade will
[24:39] open us in prayer this
[24:57] morning e
[25:56] amen the children can be dismissed for
[25:57] Sunday School and if we'll
[25:59] go we're actually going to go in
[26:02] Ecclesiastes this
[26:06] morning Ecclesiastes 3 we're going to
[26:10] read uh 1 through 14 I believe
[26:16] here it's a familiar
[26:19] scripture Ecclesiastes
[26:22] 3 to everything there is a season a time
[26:26] to every purpose under the heaven
[26:36] time to kill and a time to heal time to
[26:39] break down and a time to build
[26:47] up time to Cast Away stones and a time
[26:49] to gather Stones together a time to
[26:52] embrace and a time to refrain from
[26:54] embracing
[27:02] time to Rend and a time to sew time to
[27:05] keep silent and a time to
[27:13] speak what profit hath he that worketh
[27:15] in that wherein he
[27:24] labor Heath made everything beautiful in
[27:27] his time also he hath set the world in
[27:30] their heart so that no men can find out
[27:33] the work that God maketh from the
[27:35] beginning to the
[27:43] end and also that every man should eat
[27:46] and drink and enjoy the good of all his
[27:48] labor it is the gift of God I know that
[27:52] whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever
[27:56] nothing can be put to it nor any
[27:58] anything taken from it and God doeth it
[28:01] that men should fear before him God
[28:03] bless you may be seated brother
[28:19] Brian morning brothers and
[28:22] sisters just imagine if the whole world
[28:24] would just believe those simple 14
[28:26] verses it would be a lot different place
[28:28] here this morning if you would turn with
[28:31] me to
[28:33] U uh Malachi the thir
[28:39] chapter you know I was thinking this
[28:41] morning with all the events of the last
[28:43] 72
[28:47] hours not to be funny here but you know
[28:50] you're evolutionist and your person that
[28:53] believes in an old Earth you know it's
[28:57] awesome you can see what Mother Nature
[28:58] can do in a few short hours you know how
[29:02] he can change it can change the whole
[29:04] landscape but I was also
[29:07] thinking I was listening to that message
[29:09] this
[29:10] morning uh birth
[29:12] pains and brother brandham was really
[29:15] hitting this really hard two examples he
[29:18] was given in that message if at the end
[29:22] of it is the last 30 or 40 minutes of it
[29:25] that when he was preaching that message
[29:27] he was telling the people that God was
[29:30] trying to bring the church not the
[29:32] building but the people the church back
[29:35] to the original word back to where God
[29:38] had established his church to be in the
[29:41] original form but at the same time What
[29:43] struck me was saying that God now he
[29:46] doesn't have to bring make people do it
[29:50] if if people choose to disobey the word
[29:53] of God and not heed the word of God
[29:55] their very imaginations that possess
[29:58] rest their minds and their hearts every
[29:59] day of their life will make them be the
[30:02] opposite of what a Christian will be and
[30:05] I was just thinking he was saying how
[30:08] there's two things going on either that
[30:11] we're becoming the perfected Church of
[30:13] God through Jesus Christ and the world
[30:16] is getting in a position to be destroyed
[30:19] it's just one or the other you're going
[30:21] one way or the other and he was
[30:23] explaining that he was and in that
[30:26] message I was kind of funny was you know
[30:29] how long ago that was over 60 years ago
[30:32] and he was talking about the condition
[30:35] in California and condition in the
[30:37] country in
[30:38] 1960 and I don't even like talking about
[30:41] it anymore about the condition in
[30:44] 20124 going into October the condition
[30:48] of the world this morning so if you have
[30:50] any type of spiritual sense you know
[30:52] that we're coming to the end of this age
[30:55] and the and brother brownon was telling
[30:57] the people people in that message you're
[30:59] going to make a decision you're going to
[31:01] make a choice you either get back to the
[31:02] original or you're going to be consumed
[31:05] in what the world is consumed of this
[31:07] morning and it's a real hard thought to
[31:10] realize I know for I'm you know I'm 65
[31:12] years old I know myself if you let your
[31:15] mind get idle and you don't keep it
[31:18] rooted in the word of God it'll take you
[31:20] places that you don't want to go this
[31:22] morning that's the only thing that'll
[31:24] keep you from be keep you in the
[31:27] straight path PA and in the straight way
[31:29] is the original word of God and the
[31:31] message of the hour and you'll find
[31:33] yourself whatever you dwell on the most
[31:36] you'll find your body and your spirit
[31:38] and everything about you wanting to
[31:40] conform to that the more you feed
[31:42] whatever that is the more you're going
[31:44] to become this morning and we don't want
[31:46] that to be the negative we want it to be
[31:49] the positive this morning I hope what I
[31:51] said makes sense if you would if we'd go
[31:54] to uh ma I was reading in Malachi this
[31:57] morning
[31:58] Al and God was talking to the
[32:01] priests and I'm I'm going to jump into
[32:04] Hebrews uh but starting in Malachi 3
[32:08] excuse me Malachi 2 about I gave you the
[32:11] wrong Malachi 2 about the 4th verse and
[32:14] you shall know that I have sent this
[32:17] commandment unto you that my Covenant
[32:19] might be with Levi sayeth the Lord of
[32:22] host my Covenant was with him of life
[32:25] and peace and I gave it to the to them
[32:28] to him for the fear where he feared me
[32:31] and was afraid before my name the law of
[32:34] Truth was in his mouth and iniquity was
[32:37] not found in his lips he walked with me
[32:40] in peace and equity and did turn many
[32:44] away from their iniquities I when I read
[32:47] the scripture I try to apply it to
[32:49] myself in the day that we live in this
[32:51] morning for the priest lip should keep
[32:54] knowledge and they should seek the law
[32:56] at his mouth for he is the the messenger
[32:58] of the Lord of host and it's no
[33:00] different for the ministry for the hour
[33:02] that we live in their sole purpose is to
[33:06] eat and receive the word of God so they
[33:08] can give it to you this morning and he
[33:10] goes on this I lost my place for the
[33:12] priest lip should keep knowledge and
[33:14] they should seek the law at his mouth
[33:16] for he is the messenger of the Lord of
[33:18] hosts but ye have departed out of the
[33:21] way and you have caused many to stumble
[33:23] at the law and you have corrupted the
[33:25] Covenant of Levi sayeth the Lord host
[33:28] it's no different for us this morning
[33:29] the churches of the world have done the
[33:31] same thing that the priests did be in
[33:34] this day and age they've corrupted the
[33:36] word of God this morning and I'll just
[33:38] read therefore also I made you
[33:41] contemptible base before all people is
[33:44] according you have not kept my ways but
[33:46] have been partial in the
[33:48] law have you not all one father have not
[33:52] one God created us why do you deal
[33:54] treacherously and again we can see in
[33:58] our own day and age right now he goes
[34:00] out deal treacherously with every man
[34:02] against his brother by pering the
[34:04] Covenant of our fathers and you can say
[34:07] the same thing this morning with the New
[34:08] Testament they do the same thing this
[34:10] morning and Judah ha dealt treacherously
[34:13] and is an Abomination is committed in
[34:15] Israel and in Jerusalem for J Judah has
[34:18] profaned the Holiness of the Lord which
[34:21] he loved and hath married her daughters
[34:24] of a strange God and the Lord will cut
[34:26] off this man that doeth this the master
[34:28] and the scholar out of the Tabernacles
[34:30] of Jacob and him that offereth not
[34:33] offerings unto the Lord of host and I
[34:35] was going to jump to Hebrews here this
[34:38] morning the eth chapter if I can find it
[34:42] here this
[34:44] morning but I was really thinking about
[34:46] what brother brandham had to say about
[34:48] in that message birth pains this
[34:50] morning how it's really important for us
[34:53] this morning to realize you're either
[34:56] and all the ministers that come through
[34:58] lately or are really hitting that you're
[35:01] either going to go one way or the other
[35:02] you're either going to get closer to
[35:04] Christ this morning or today or you're
[35:07] going to get further away and brother
[35:08] Brandon was talking about that was
[35:11] talking to the people at the end of that
[35:12] message and some of the quotes that were
[35:15] up there this morning are the same
[35:17] you're either going to get closer or
[35:19] you're going to get further apart it's
[35:21] it's it's a dividing time there people
[35:23] are going to know who you are and what
[35:25] you are you you can't walk the fence
[35:26] anymore it's a providing time they'll
[35:28] know in your lives the way you talk the
[35:31] way you act and react to any given
[35:33] situation what you are and who you are
[35:35] this morning and um I I was about to say
[35:40] something but I won't say it I say it a
[35:41] lot but I was just thinking and The
[35:43] Ghost and this eth chapter in Hebrews
[35:45] kind of deals with what God was dealing
[35:48] with the priest also and if I read this
[35:50] whole chapter you'll have to forgive me
[35:52] this morning uh it really speaks also of
[35:55] the day and age that we live in this
[35:57] morning
[35:58] now of the things which we have spoken
[36:01] this is the sum we have such a high
[36:04] priest was set on the right hand of the
[36:06] Throne of the Majesty that is in heaven
[36:08] a minister of the sanctuary of the true
[36:11] Tabernacle which the Lord pitched not
[36:13] man so God built this Tabernacle not man
[36:17] for every high priest is ordained to
[36:19] offer gifts and sacrifice wherefore it
[36:23] is necessity this man have somewhat also
[36:26] to offer we know what he offered he
[36:28] offered his very life and he goes on to
[36:30] say for we have and if for if we here
[36:34] were on the earth he should not be a
[36:36] priest saying that there are priests
[36:38] that offer gifts according to the law
[36:41] who serve us an example and a shadow of
[36:43] heavenly things so they're talking about
[36:46] the Old Testament
[36:47] times and Moses was admonished of God
[36:50] when he was about to make the Tabernacle
[36:53] for see saith he that thou make all
[36:56] things according in to the pattern
[36:58] showed thee in the mount and I'm
[37:00] thinking this morning it's no different
[37:02] for us this morning when you build a
[37:04] Church of God you have to build it by
[37:06] God's pattern this morning and we have
[37:08] that pattern this morning in the word of
[37:10] the hour that we all believe God gave us
[37:13] a pattern he gave us a cooker cutter for
[37:16] what we're supposed to follow this
[37:17] morning and he goes on to say but now he
[37:20] have obtained a more excellent Ministry
[37:22] by how much also he is the mediator a
[37:26] better Covenant which was established
[37:28] upon a better promise for it was first a
[37:31] covenant have been faultless should be
[37:34] no place have been sought for the second
[37:36] for finding fault within he saith behold
[37:39] it the days come sayith the Lord when I
[37:41] will make a New Covenant with the house
[37:43] of Israel and with the house of Judah
[37:45] and that's where we're at this morning
[37:47] not according to the Covenant that I
[37:49] made with their fathers in the in the
[37:51] day when I took them by the hand and led
[37:53] them by the land of e out of the land of
[37:57] Egypt because they continue not in my
[37:59] Covenant nor regarded them sayeth the
[38:02] Lord for this is the Covenant that I
[38:04] will make with the house of Israel after
[38:06] those days sayeth the Lord and this is
[38:09] where we're at this morning and I hope
[38:10] everyone is at this place this morning I
[38:13] will put my laws into their mind and I
[38:15] will write them in their hearts and I
[38:17] will be to them a God and they shall be
[38:19] to me a people and they shall not teach
[38:22] every man for to his neighbor or every
[38:25] man to his neighbor saying no the Lord
[38:28] For All Shall know me from the least to
[38:30] the greatest that's where we're at this
[38:32] morning and for I will be merciful to
[38:34] the
[38:36] unrighteousness let me reread that
[38:38] correctly I will be merciful to the to
[38:41] their unrighteousness and their sins and
[38:43] our iniquities will I remember no more
[38:46] and that he saith a New Covenant he had
[38:48] made the first old now which is decayed
[38:52] and W old is ready to vanish away and
[38:54] that's where we're at this morning here
[38:56] we're under that New Covenant and I was
[38:58] just thinking of the
[39:00] circumstances you know you think of not
[39:03] too far away from here there's millions
[39:04] of people suffering this morning you
[39:07] know so my hope is for them that God
[39:09] will touch their lives and it won't be
[39:11] too long when you when I saw the stuff
[39:13] that I saw this morning or the last
[39:16] couple of days and I
[39:17] realize we are human beings you know
[39:21] sometimes you we think of more of
[39:23] ourselves than we really are life is a
[39:26] fragile thing this morning and we hold
[39:28] on to it by a prayer and a hope that
[39:30] we'll be there on that day and I would
[39:33] just hope that God will bless those
[39:35] people over there that they'll have a
[39:37] speedy recovery from this situation this
[39:39] morning and we have empathy and concern
[39:42] for them brother Josh
[40:01] and we just have one announcement this
[40:03] morning before we start singing Sister

[1:13:27] moment this next hour every minute every
[1:13:31] second that you give us Lord and the
[1:13:34] breath the strength that you give us to
[1:13:36] praise you with Lord we thank you and
[1:13:38] for the right and uh to be able to
[1:13:42] assemble ourselves together Lord and to
[1:13:44] worship you we want to thank you for
[1:13:46] that Lord sometimes we take that for
[1:13:48] granted realizing Lord Jesus that may be
[1:13:51] coming to an end one of these days and
[1:13:54] we just want to thank thank you Father
[1:13:55] for being able to take a day out of the
[1:13:58] week Sunday to get together and and to
[1:14:02] worship you in spirit and in truth to
[1:14:05] close down our jobs our work and get
[1:14:07] away from all of that Lord and to pray
[1:14:11] before we come and ask you to come in a
[1:14:13] special way and receive our thanks and
[1:14:16] gratitude for all that you are and what
[1:14:18] you mean to us to gather together and
[1:14:20] then to sing songs father from a Heart
[1:14:22] Lord to you Lord not out of rich ual or
[1:14:25] out of uh stagnation but Lord out of out
[1:14:28] of real life God that you've given in
[1:14:30] our hearts and Lord Jesus Just To
[1:14:33] Worship You in spirit and in truth Lord
[1:14:35] then also to open up our ears and to see
[1:14:38] what the spirit would have to say this
[1:14:39] morning Father we pray Lord that you'll
[1:14:42] speak to Hearts this morning Father and
[1:14:44] we just ask God that you'll have the
[1:14:45] preeminence in my life my heart and
[1:14:49] every part of me Lord Jesus that you
[1:14:51] might use me Lord to speak the things
[1:14:53] that you once said Lord and
[1:14:55] father you know just everybody and what
[1:14:58] each one has need of Lord and we ask God
[1:15:00] that you'll come and do the ministering
[1:15:02] this morning Father for we ask it in
[1:15:04] Jesus name amen and amen so I don't
[1:15:07] really know uh just right off hand I
[1:15:10] guess but I would call this one of the
[1:15:12] uh an appreciation and a gratitude for
[1:15:15] who God is in our life type of message
[1:15:19] amen amen and so I mean there's lots of
[1:15:22] different types of messages that do do
[1:15:25] different things but this is certainly
[1:15:28] amen something that'll bring honor and
[1:15:29] glory to his name and something that we
[1:15:32] worship him for amen and I've spoken on
[1:15:36] this many a times but I feel led to
[1:15:38] speak on it again amen and so
[1:15:43] um amen because we know that in times
[1:15:46] like these you need a savior amen amen
[1:15:50] how many believes that in time of likees
[1:15:52] these you need an anchor amen in times
[1:15:56] like these we need Jesus more than ever
[1:15:58] before as brother Brian was saying when
[1:16:00] you look around it's just uh hardly
[1:16:03] hardly words words uh how do you really
[1:16:08] uh express it in words the
[1:16:11] disappointment and
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:15] uh of of the conditions of the world how
[1:16:19] do you describe that amen other than
[1:16:22] Total Insanity isn't that right am amen
[1:16:25] so we're going to try to express it in a
[1:16:27] little bit here uh if we can in by the
[1:16:30] grace of God Amen so if you will let's
[1:16:34] start amen let's just start somewhere
[1:16:37] here amen maybe we'll go with uh Hebrews
[1:16:41] I guess Hebrews 12 maybe Hebrews
[1:16:48] 12 amen I don't know about you but I
[1:16:50] sure enjoy having our Wednesdays and our
[1:16:53] Sundays to come together and wor the
[1:16:55] Lord don't you is it nice just to come
[1:16:58] and sit one among another and amen and
[1:17:00] feel that sweet presence of the spirit
[1:17:04] amen and amen and just to have this
[1:17:07] moment this time that we have with God
[1:17:10] Amen I certainly enjoy
[1:17:12] it amen and so I just pray that the
[1:17:15] message this morning will be a blessing
[1:17:17] we do want to remember before I read now
[1:17:19] amen that sister Marjorie has been
[1:17:21] diagnosed with cancer this little pain
[1:17:24] that was in her stomach and could not
[1:17:26] get rid of it could not get rid of it
[1:17:28] amen and so finally did he a test and
[1:17:30] found out that it was cancerous and of
[1:17:32] course as you have been updated we know
[1:17:34] that they had to do a CAT scan to see
[1:17:36] whether amen it had spread to other
[1:17:38] places because if it had spread to other
[1:17:40] places amen they could not have had an
[1:17:43] operation they would not have had
[1:17:45] operation but they would had to go to
[1:17:48] radiation and other kinds of treatments
[1:17:50] and she had told me yesterday that she
[1:17:53] just don't know if she would have went
[1:17:54] that route so our sister was under great
[1:17:57] anticipation Amen to find out to hear
[1:18:00] the news basically that would have been
[1:18:02] between life and death for her amen so
[1:18:06] when they came back and said after the
[1:18:08] CAT scan that it was not spread

[1:22:03] doesn't shift like the kingdoms of the
[1:22:05] world
[1:22:06] do how many knows that we're living in
[1:22:08] the time that everything that can be
[1:22:12] shaken will be shaken and not only does
[1:22:15] it say that but it says that anything
[1:22:18] that can be shaken is going to be
[1:22:21] removed amen the moving of those things
[1:22:23] that can be shaken shaken amen how many

[1:22:36] us a that
[1:22:39] right but you know I want to take Paul
[1:22:41] for just a few minutes if I
[1:22:43] could
[1:22:47] amen Paul said in Acts 20 I believe it
[1:22:52] was Acts 20 in verse 22 he says Now
[1:22:56] Behold I go Bound in the spirit unto
[1:23:01] Jerusalem not knowing that the things
[1:23:03] that shall befall me
[1:23:06] there say that the holy spirit because
[1:23:09] he would lot of time people would
[1:23:11] prophesy in the churches and so
[1:23:13] forth and tell him of these things save
[1:23:16] that the Holy Spirit Witnesses in every
[1:23:19] city saying that bonds and afflictions
[1:23:23] abide me
[1:23:25] wow imagine having the Holy Spirit speak
[1:23:28] through people and prophesy that
[1:23:31] afflictions and trials and how bad
[1:23:34] things is coming upon
[1:23:36] you if anything would shake you it would
[1:23:38] shake you wouldn't
[1:23:40] it
[1:23:42] amen but what does Paul say he says but
[1:23:46] none of those things move
[1:23:49] [Laughter]
[1:23:51] me w
[1:23:55] why I'll tell you why because how many
[1:23:58] knows God I mean brother Paul had an
[1:24:02] experience when he was going to
[1:24:04] persecute the Christians on the road to
[1:24:07] Damascus he had a real
[1:24:11] experience an experience with
[1:24:15] God this will be a little bit tar to
[1:24:17] young people this
[1:24:18] morning amen because we know that if
[1:24:21] you're ever going to have an anchor
[1:24:23] you've got to have an anchor anchor on
[1:24:25] this ocean of life that we're floating
[1:24:28] down on this sea of life or on this
[1:24:30] River of Life so to speak you got to
[1:24:33] have an anchor you got to have something
[1:24:40] solid something unmovable you can't rely
[1:24:43] on your mom and dad you can't rely on
[1:24:46] Thomas berer you can't rely on a church
[1:24:48] or even like that but you can't rely on
[1:24:50] preachers you've got to have something
[1:24:53] deeper than that
[1:24:57] and Paul had
[1:24:59] that he had something that he was
[1:25:01] anchored to and what was that it was
[1:25:04] where Jesus asked the disciples who do
[1:25:06] the son of say who do you say the son of
[1:25:08] man am and Peter said Thou Art the
[1:25:11] Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:25:12] Jesus said now you didn't learn this
[1:25:15] from Seminary you didn't get this from a
[1:25:17] preacher but my Father which is in
[1:25:19] heaven revealed this to you what was it
[1:25:23] a revelation
[1:25:26] now from what I understand brother Bram
[1:25:27] said the rock wasn't
[1:25:29] Jesus The Rock wasn't the Catholic
[1:25:32] Church hello The Rock wasn't Peter The
[1:25:36] Rock upon which the church is built is
[1:25:39] the revelation of Jesus Christ that is
[1:25:43] The Rock when God personally reveals
[1:25:47] something to you just like he did Moses
[1:25:50] isn't that right oh Moses didn't have a
[1:25:53] revelation and slew the Egyptian and so
[1:25:56] forth no no more are you going to
[1:25:57] persecute my people and so forth and it
[1:25:59] didn't go
[1:26:01] nowhere that was in his
[1:26:03] flesh but it was a different story on
[1:26:06] the back side of the desert when God
[1:26:08] called him up there and had a talk with
[1:26:10] him wo folks I'm here to tell you how
[1:26:13] many knows I'll tell you what if God
[1:26:14] ever talks to
[1:26:16] you if you ever hear his voice my sheep
[1:26:19] hear my voice and a stranger they will
[1:26:23] not follow every person has to have that
[1:26:26] if they're ever going to get out of this
[1:26:30] backsliding this floating this moving
[1:26:34] this everchanging world that we live
[1:26:39] in
[1:26:42] amen we understand the pope is making
[1:26:44] some new
[1:26:46] laws taking some of God's laws out and
[1:26:48] putting his own laws in amen one of
[1:26:51] these days you know he said he he made a
[1:26:53] rule that but if it's a sin to be
[1:26:56] poor a sin to be poor what's he want to
[1:26:58] do kill all the poor people too huh he
[1:27:01] killed all the Christians and he's going
[1:27:03] to pick out who he wants all those are
[1:27:05] against the climate and everything else
[1:27:08] it sounded to me like he was pushing the
[1:27:09] green New
[1:27:11] Deal hello to transgress against the
[1:27:15] climate and all of these other things
[1:27:16] you know a a and think about it how many
[1:27:20] knows if you've seen that video of it
[1:27:21] all the Muslims and all all the world
[1:27:24] they had a great big gathering together
[1:27:27] they had a great big screen up there
[1:27:29] with the Pope up there and all of that
[1:27:32] hello and I thought you know it ain't no
[1:27:34] wonder that all of those people will
[1:27:36] join in with the Pope they're deceived
[1:27:37] already so it isn't going to matter that
[1:27:39] much
[1:27:40] more cuz if you ain't following Jesus
[1:27:43] you're
[1:27:46] deceived
[1:27:47] amen but we're living in that kind of a
[1:27:50] world we're living in a you can't have
[1:27:52] confidence in the United States and our
[1:27:54] constitution how many knows it's
[1:27:56] crumbled not is crumbling but it has
[1:27:59] already completely
[1:28:03] crumbled
[1:28:05] amen that's right so there's no
[1:28:07] confidence we can't have
[1:28:09] confidence or set your anchor on the
[1:28:12] country that we live in we know that all
[1:28:14] kingdoms of all the world have all
[1:28:17] Fallen ain't that right Nebuchadnezzar
[1:28:20] the head of God the great country it
[1:28:22] fell the next one after that Greece fell
[1:28:26] Rome
[1:28:27] fell
[1:28:29] hello all of those fall and the only one
[1:28:32] that has survived would be the Roman
[1:28:34] Catholic church for the last 2,000 years
[1:28:37] and you can't have no confidence in them
[1:28:39] they're going to change something and
[1:28:40] make a difference it's always shifting
[1:28:44] but it's the Antichrist
[1:28:46] hello oh my think about it listen how
[1:28:50] many knows that it won't is that a big
[1:28:52] deal for the Pentecostal to apst and all
[1:28:54] of them to join the pope even when
[1:28:56] brother Brandon was here he was telling
[1:28:58] trying to tell him to stay away from
[1:28:59] that and he's saying you know it' be
[1:29:01] nice if we kind of fellowship with
[1:29:03] them ain't that right that's what the
[1:29:06] denomination churches were saying but
[1:29:08] says but we hear the Holy Spirit saying
[1:29:09] get away from that
[1:29:12] thing amen woo that's right so even then
[1:29:16] they were kind of leaning that way it
[1:29:18] ain't no wonder if they join
[1:29:20] it but for you and I
[1:29:24] amen want no part of that we want
[1:29:28] something that doesn't
[1:29:30] change and the Bible says that there's
[1:29:32] one thing that's immutable amen and that
[1:29:34] is that God cannot lie amen the Pope's
[1:29:38] word they'll change they'll fall they'll
[1:29:40] fail but Jesus said amen the words that
[1:29:43] I speak to you he says Heaven and Earth
[1:29:46] will pass away but my word will never
[1:29:49] pass away I don't care what pope tries
[1:29:51] to change or what man tries to change it
[1:29:53] his word will forever be
[1:29:57] true it'll never change that's why my
[1:30:00] hope is built on nothing less than Jesus
[1:30:03] blood and righteousness amen our anchor
[1:30:05] is in the word of
[1:30:10] God sure
[1:30:12] [Applause]

[1:30:16] to my brain right now if you can be
[1:30:20] shaken you will be shaken
[1:30:27] and anything that can be shaken the
[1:30:29] Bible says it signifies the removing of
[1:30:32] those things that can be
[1:30:34] shaken

[1:52:02] for her baby she was
[1:52:05] Fearless amen don't matter how much of
[1:52:07] the skin was peeling off from the heat
[1:52:10] she's going to have her baby because of
[1:52:11] the love of God Amen three Hebrew
[1:52:17] children three Hebrew children that
[1:52:19] right they love God and they didn't care
[1:52:20] if they were going to get thrown in the
[1:52:22] fire they they love God brother Bram
[1:52:24] said whenever he said when he cares do
[1:52:26] you care and then that statement he says
[1:52:28] you got to care first because he's
[1:52:29] already cared now he's waiting for you
[1:52:31] to care and when you care he says then
[1:52:34] he'll care if those those three Hebrew
[1:52:37] children cared enough to make a
[1:52:38] statement for God don't know if you will
[1:52:40] but we're not going to Bow anyway say
[1:52:42] God said oh let me go through the fire I
[1:52:45] don't care about what fired it I'm
[1:52:47] coming to rescue my
[1:52:50] boys when you love God like that when
[1:52:53] you get in situations like that amen if
[1:52:55] you love God the way that you said you
[1:52:57] remember this God is coming on to
[1:53:00] see he's got to love you because you
[1:53:03] love
[1:53:05] him that's why I said Paul said in
[1:53:08] Romans eight what shall separate it from
[1:53:10] the love God tribulation distress and
[1:53:12] all these things no he said nothing why
[1:53:14] because you're anchored in the love of
[1:53:19] God but if it's just because your mom
[1:53:21] and daddy go to church that's not kind
[1:53:23] going to cut it just because they have a
[1:53:25] relationship and understand the prophet
[1:53:27] of God and who God is and have a
[1:53:28] relationship with Jesus
[1:53:30] Christ not good enough for you you got
[1:53:33] to have your own personal relationship
[1:53:36] with
[1:53:36] Jesus if God hasn't revealed that to you

[1:53:41] anything else in the world that God will
[1:53:44] come down and do something for
[1:53:47] you amen why do you think a lot of times
[1:53:50] we repeat ourselves and our testimony of
[1:53:53] what God did for us amen because that's
[1:53:56] when that took place that anchoring took
[1:53:59] place that
[1:54:02] anchoring we don't know where we don't
[1:54:05] know
[1:54:06] how but somewhere somehow when God does

[2:01:02] the
[2:01:03] master how manyan know all of these
[2:01:05] kingdoms they can't never run them can
[2:01:08] they they always
[2:01:11] fall look at
[2:01:13] America didn't our forefathers say if it
[2:01:16] was ever run by anybody but Christians
[2:01:18] it wouldn't work well here we are it it
[2:01:22] ain't going to work why because they
[2:01:24] want to if the Supreme Court Justices
[2:01:27] say a certain thing they want to get rid
[2:01:28] of them
[2:01:29] justices that shows how obsurd they are
[2:01:32] how far it's gone
[2:01:36] amen they can't run it but listen to
[2:01:39] what it says it's guided
[2:01:42] Guided by a
[2:01:45] master and if theya
[2:01:50] countries like nebuchad
[2:01:53] Lazar how many knows he was the head of
[2:01:55] gold he had prospered above everybody he
[2:01:58] was the greatest but you know why he
[2:02:01] couldn't run
[2:02:02] it he didn't have the Holy
[2:02:05] Ghost and what happened Pride came
[2:02:09] in Pride came in he says all the things
[2:02:14] have I done God says no no no no
[2:02:18] no no no no no you wouldn't be there
[2:02:21] didn't evenes Jesus say to pilate he
[2:02:23] says if wasn't for my father giving you
[2:02:26] the power you'd have no
[2:02:29] power he put him in his place you'd have
[2:02:32] no power you wouldn't have at anything
[2:02:34] if God didn't give it to you amen but
[2:02:38] Pride come in and there it went how many
[2:02:41] know say Christian or anybody let Pride
[2:02:43] come in pride comes before a downfall
[2:02:47] that's exactly right and how many knows
[2:02:49] I mean listen young people you God never
[2:02:51] never meant for you to run your own life
[2:02:54] no sir sir the world all of these people

[2:03:11] this Kingdom right here God never meant
[2:03:14] for you to run
[2:03:19] it listen to what he says
[2:03:25] God wants to mold
[2:03:27] us and to make us what he wants us to be
[2:03:30] but how can he do it how can God do it
[2:03:32] when we won't even hold still for him to
[2:03:35] do it we want to be our own

[2:04:13] they let me let me give you an
[2:04:14] experienced veteran idea and that is

[2:07:10] and that that's a great big ocean they'd
[2:07:12] probably run out of food out of the
[2:07:13] grace of God some waves throwing them up

[2:11:39] over it and I said wonder what that is
[2:11:42] and the fellow sitting said it's got a
[2:11:44] sea anchor on it therefore said that
[2:11:47] ship cannot sink he said he said it can
[2:11:50] go through the water Waters but it can't
[2:11:52] sink because it's anchored I said oh

[2:11:57] God somebody say it with me oh praise be
[2:12:01] to God that's right oh praise be to God
[2:12:06] we got an anchor say it with me we got
[2:12:09] an
[2:12:11] anchor some waves can go over some can
[2:12:14] go under but regardless it's anchored
[2:12:17] and it isn't the ship doing the holding
[2:12:23] Lor it wasn't you no if anything you let
[2:12:27] go I let go but it don't let
[2:12:31] go

[2:13:01] holding it's the anchor doing the
[2:13:03] holding it isn't what I am or what I
[2:13:06] will be it's what he is amen and what he
[2:13:10] did for me it's not what I can do it's
[2:13:14] what he's done my faith isn't Anchored
[2:13:17] In what the coming meetings will be or
[2:13:20] my faith doesn't rest in the ability
[2:13:22] that I have or upon the church that I
[2:13:24] join or the people that I associate with
[2:13:28] my faith anchors and rest entirely on
[2:13:30] the finished work of the Lord Jesus
[2:13:33] Christ
[2:13:35] amen when an eagle makes its nest it
[2:13:37] takes it away from all of the things of
[2:13:39] the world and goes way up into the Rocks
[2:13:42] way up high and it finds a Clift in that
[2:13:45] rock and it goes into that Cliff of that
[2:13:47] Rock Amen and it builds its nest and it
[2:13:49] brings its young up there amen for
[2:13:51] safety and for a security how many's
[2:13:54] glad for the Cliff of Jesus Christ our
[2:13:57] anchor holes we're safe in the cleft of
[2:14:00] Jesus Christ we're trusting in what God
[2:14:02] has done in the Clift my anchor oh
[2:14:07] Hallelujah in the cleft of the Rock Amen
[2:14:11] and coverthe there with his hand Amen
[2:14:14] brother Joshua sang that song and that I
[2:14:16] pretty much started out with that song
[2:14:17] and I wrote I like that song Amen
[2:14:21] and covers me there with his hand and
[2:14:24] covers me there in this Leia Church age
[2:14:28] with his
[2:14:30] hand Mercy said
[2:14:33] no I'm not going to let you go I'm not
[2:14:37] GNA let you slip
[2:14:39] away
[2:14:42] amen a quick last thought and that is
[2:14:47] our anchor is in our genetics
[2:14:52] our anchor is in our
[2:14:54] genetics now I'm talking about spiritual
[2:14:57] genetics what did Brother Braham said if
[2:14:59] you ever have life if you have eternal
[2:15:01] life you had to be a seed Gene of
[2:15:05] God a seed Gene of God if you aren't a
[2:15:09] seed Gene you never will be there you
[2:15:11] won't have to desire to
[2:15:13] want who's soever Will you won't want
[2:15:16] that's why if you're a young person amen
[2:15:18] you've got to desire your heart I want
[2:15:19] to be a Christian I want to serve God
[2:15:21] with all of my heart you thank God for
[2:15:23] that that little seed Jean in there is
[2:15:26] calling out that woman at the well she
[2:15:28] had a seed on the inside amen and it was
[2:15:30] the anchor but abam says if you don't
[2:15:32] have that c g there's no chance for
[2:15:36] you but if you are a SE Gene of God
[2:15:40] you're
[2:15:41] coming why because the anchor says amen
[2:15:44] I will lose none of mine Paul said God
[2:15:47] knows them that are his and he won't
[2:15:49] lose one
[2:15:51] all right but you've got to be a part of
[2:15:52] the family of God you got to be a Blood
[2:15:55] of his blood flesh of his flesh life of
[2:15:57] his
[2:15:59] life
[2:16:02] genetics amen take my genetics take my
[2:16:04] dad genetics I never had to join the
[2:16:07] berer family you never had to join your
[2:16:11] family why you was born in

[2:16:20] really but so to speak yes I
[2:16:24] am you're a
[2:16:26] liar if you don't think you're a liar
[2:16:28] let's go down here and have our genetics
[2:16:30] tested huh Ain that right that's always
[2:16:33] how they find out if some baby is the
[2:16:35] Daddy's baby or not right A lot of times
[2:16:38] there's big disappointments sad to
[2:16:42] say Amen but the Tad exp PR of who you
[2:16:46] are your desire brother abam even said
[2:16:49] it just depends amen all we're all made
[2:16:51] out of the stuff amen but it depends on
[2:16:53] when your Ambitions run depends on where
[2:16:55] your genetics are and if those genetics
[2:16:58] are
[2:17:03] there you can't help being who you are
[2:17:07] you're going to manifest
[2:17:09] that a lot of people come up and say
[2:17:11] brother Bor you look like your dad or
[2:17:12] your uncle or did that or the other why
[2:17:15] because it's part of the
[2:17:16] family amen aren't you glad to be a part
[2:17:20] of the family of God
[2:17:21] God Amen praise God God is good isn't he
[2:17:26] so my this this morning I'm just
[2:17:30] rejoicing night and day as I walk this
[2:17:33] narrow way for he abides how many's glad
[2:17:36] to be anchored in the age when
[2:17:38] everything's shaken I could read you
[2:17:40] Jude there and we won't get too much
[2:17:43] into it but it talks about how did the
[2:17:44] Angels left their estate ain't that
[2:17:46] right and the people that God brought
[2:17:48] out of Egypt ain't that right destroyed
[2:17:51] them afterwards that believe not amen
[2:17:53] they're like Raging Waves of the sea
[2:17:56] they're like clouds Without Rain amen
[2:17:58] driven With the
[2:18:00] Wind huh aren't you glad that you're oh
[2:18:03] I want to there's one aspect of this
[2:18:06] amen when it comes some
[2:18:07] moving am me when the Devil comes at us
[2:18:10] and all of the world comes at it we
[2:18:11] don't move but at the slightest little
[2:18:13] push the lightest little tug that the
[2:18:16] holy spirit amen moves you move with it
[2:18:20] ain't that right how many beli we don't
[2:18:21] we do believe in being moved but be
[2:18:23] moved by the holy
[2:18:25] spirit amen but not like they were
[2:18:30] tossed wandering about ain't that
[2:18:34] right like the
[2:18:37] stars here today there tomorrow believe
[2:18:41] this today believe that tomorrow amen I
[2:18:44] don't know but I would I'd be
[2:18:47] a it'd be crazy wouldn't it to be a
[2:18:50] Catholic then all of a sudden the pope
[2:18:52] changes
[2:18:54] something changes
[2:18:56] something makes it something
[2:19:00] different you know the bad part Brother
[2:19:02] Brad about even talk to a Catholic is
[2:19:04] well the the Bible ain't the absolute
[2:19:06] the church is the absolute is that what
[2:19:08] the argument they had with brother

[2:21:34] bowed eyes
[2:21:36] closed let the Holy Spirit go down into
[2:21:39] your
[2:21:40] heart ask yourself if you're really
[2:21:42] Anchored In Christ if Christ has really
[2:21:45] revealed himself to you and you know who
[2:21:48] you are that you're a child of God
[2:21:50] you're a son you're a daughter of God
[2:21:51] you're a Christian but if you're not

[2:21:57] know that I know that I know that I'm
[2:21:59] one of his God bless that hand God bless
[2:22:02] you Lord Jesus we ask God that those
[2:22:05] hands that are up right now Lord that
[2:22:07] you'll give them unwavering Fearless
[2:22:11] confidence that they're all right with
[2:22:13] you that all their sins are under the
[2:22:14] blood and that they're Anchored In
[2:22:16] Christ Lord this morning these hands
[2:22:18] that go up we ask God in Jesus name name
[2:22:21] let them have an experience like they've
[2:22:23] never had Lord give them that confidence
[2:22:26] Lord Jesus anchor
[2:22:28] them and when the storms come when the
[2:22:30] winds blow it doesn't move them we think
[2:22:34] of the prophet of God when somebody
[2:22:35] would drop dead perhaps in the audience
[2:22:38] he said just stay calm just be still
[2:22:43] don't get All Shook Up don't get all out
[2:22:45] just be calm the holy spirit is here may
[2:22:48] that be our lives when something happens
[2:22:50] happens drastic happens we don't have to
[2:22:52] get all tore up but we can just have
[2:22:54] that confidence in Christ that he has
[2:22:56] brought us safe thus far he'll lead us
[2:22:58] home I pray for every person under the
[2:23:01] sound of my voice every sheep God that
[2:23:03] you have put under me Lord Jesus and
[2:23:04] given me I pray that you would give them
[2:23:06] that anchor Lord and let not one of them
[2:23:08] be lost Lord When Storms Come their way
[2:23:11] when doubts come into our teenagers
[2:23:13] Minds when they see hypocrisy when they
[2:23:16] see faults and failures in the pastor
[2:23:19] deacons trustees Mom Dad neighbors other
[2:23:22] Christians may they not look to that but
[2:23:24] they may look to you and say God I want
[2:23:26] that anchor in my heart so much that I
[2:23:28] don't rely on what other people or don't
[2:23:30] do or do but Lord I want to have a
[2:23:33] personal relationship with you father we
