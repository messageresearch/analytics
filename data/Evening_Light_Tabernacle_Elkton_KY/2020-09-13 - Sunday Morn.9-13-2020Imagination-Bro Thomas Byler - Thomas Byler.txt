soul [Music] it's different now since [Music] when jesus rescued me and now it's different hey man i'm glad it's different aren't you and as we're singing that song i i remember the night i gave my heart and life to the lord i went to work the next day and the manager of the place where i worked at he he said come here i need to talk to you i thought well i hadn't done anything wrong today it was a monday and he took me up into his office he said what's happened to you [Music] i said what do you mean he said i haven't heard one foul word come out of your mouth today [Music] because last night i met the lord jesus he changed my language he changed the views of guys into he changed my thoughts i said he changed everything about me in one day [Music] i said that's all i can tell you [Music] because uh unfortunately i hate to say this but i had a very much a very bad mouth and nice words didn't always come out but i said it's different now hallelujah i'm glad it's different this

before the lord in prayer kind of heavenly father as we come before you once again lord grateful lord jesus to be able to approach your throne lord this morning father lord as we just ask god that as we approach your throne and as each one father has come into your house to present themselves before you lord we just ask god that you'd look at every heart this morning lord and see where we're at with you lord jesus father you know our hearts lord jesus and you know our thoughts you know everything about us lord and we just stand open before you and ask god that you just minister to our hearts now and speak to to our hearts father say what you once said lord jesus through your word father we truly believe with all of our heart father that you still are ministering lord jesus just like you did while you was here on earth and you're doing it through your people lord jesus and through the vessels that you've chosen father lord you're still the same yesterday today forever your ministry is the same and we just asked god that once again you would speak to your people as you did father lord jesus when you said come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest father i truly believe you still speak father and we ask lord that you'll speak to us this morning now by the way of your word and that which you i feel lord that you've laid upon my heart to speak lord get me out of the way that you might just have your way this morning father and we thank you lord jesus for every heart lord and every soul that is coming to your house lord that cares enough about you that loves you enough father to come into your house and and to present themselves before you lord and we just ask god that you'll bless the reading of the word now in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen i think i will go to the very very scriptures very scripture that i begin to i think amen brought me to this subject amen and we'll get to the thought with the help of the lord and this morning sermon uh is going to be and i'm going to title this i mean it's off of a song that somebody wrote that i really like amen and that song is i can only imagine i can only imagine amen and so when i read this scripture that song and that word came into my mind so we'll title that i can only imagine if that's okay revelations 1 it turned to revelations 1 with me if you will i'm not going to detail on this until a little bit later and so as i begin to study i do have a lot of scriptures we could probably take about 30 minutes just reading the scriptures that i've got so amen just hang on to your seats i guess for a while amen so so we don't we'll just see how the lord will go and how it'll go because i amen may give an opportunity for an altar afterwards because it is it'll be one of the most serious well it is the most serious type of messages that your man could preach amen because it does have to do with judgment and mercy amen and the day of the lord coming and being ready for his coming amen so i believe it's very very vital but in verse chapter revelations chapter 1 and verse 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall well because of him even so amen i am the alpha and the omega the beginning in the end saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty now if you will turn over to the book of genesis amen we want to begin to talk about imagination amen imagination and that's what we're going to dwell with for just a little bit amen and then we're going to move on to a couple different directions in genesis the 6th chapter genesis 6. and not having preached on this and certainly not being a specialist in um explaining words i just trust the lord will be able to convey to you what really is in my mind chapter 6 and verse 5. and god saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually amen now go to another one on talking about imagination and that is in revelation i mean in genesis 11 let's go and talk a little bit more about imagination for just a minute genesis 11 and we'll read one through nine it says and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another let go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly that they had and they have brick for stone and slime they had for mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make let us make us a name least we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to the city and to the tower which the children of men had built it and the lord said see behold the people is one and they are all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down now and confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so that the lord scattered them abroad from tents upon the face of the all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel how many knows that that's what's the first babylon that's where about the first bible amen because to everybody everybody was babbling you know just it was it's confusion babel means confusion amen so this was the first babylon and we've had several different babylons and there's a babylon right over at the end of the whole revelations which we won't get into but so he says it was called babel because the lord did confound the language of all the earth and from fence that the lord scattered them abroad upon the face of the earth all right may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated now how many knows that the children of men wanted to build a tower so that guess what pretty much so no matter how deep the water got they could actually go up and climb up above it and god says here that you know nothing and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do amen we're going to dwell on that for just a little bit talking about imagination now first he talks about over in genesis there that the wickedness of man was great and he says it was the imagination of his thoughts amen so he ties our imagination to our thoughts because how many knows that's where your imagination comes from is from a thought from your thoughts amen and we know that even god even god before the foundation of the world we could say you know before there was anything made god what what did he do he thought all this isn't that right so in his mind he thought he imagined it he imagined everything that was going to happen only god's imaginations and god's thoughts they're not something you know because many times we think of imagination as being something that is mystical because then let me say this there's two kinds of imaginations one of them truly is mystical but the other one is real it just depends on what you're imagining and what you're thinking about what your thoughts are are they god's thoughts or are they your thoughts and we know that every movie that is made all come from the imagination amen and here even here the building of the city ups the first thing you gotta do is you got to imagine it it has to be in your mind you have to have it fixed in your mind amen and so here he says that even god said look there's almost going to be nothing impossible how does he put it again there will be nothing restraint from them amen and we know that even today amen is if because of their imagination amen there's almost nothing that people can't do amen or put it this way almost everything that they can imagine they can do is that right that's where humanity is i mean years ago we would have uh you know we'd you know we'd have never thought about talking to our phone and being able to pull up any information and that they would talk back and you know all of the automated systems that they have nowadays of amen when you get on the phone and it is most irritating to me i like to talk with somebody don't you amen and most of the time those automated things are better than better for giving you a run around than a person is the only kind of automated phone calls that i like is the one that they call me in that right and i say okay you know they're trying to sell you something the second that i see that it's a machine i don't mind hidden in do you it doesn't make me feel one bad at all now if it's a person it that bothers you a little bit you don't want to hang up on a person it's not polite but when that machine doesn't stop talking and they understand what i just said i realize it's a machine you know and if it isn't and if a person just keeps babbling hey i'll probably hang up on you because you are being real rude here not even listen to what i'm saying but anyway so you know we look at the world we're living in and it is absolutely you know phenomenal at what man can do we realize that because people imagined that we could actually go to the moon and you know how many knows it was one what was it one small step for man but one giant st for mankind when we stepped on the moon isn't that right because they imagined it amen and i can't imagine if you uh um you know if you told people you know back in the 1700s you know if you just said you know one day man is going to go up there to that moon well you would have been class in your city among your people as a crazy person isn't that right they'd say what are you going to do drive your horse up there you know how you're going to get up there you know even how many knows even flying at one time was out of people you're going to fly through the sky if you told people back then that we was going to fly through the skies you know with 600 people in one place they just thought it was crazy and so many things many many things that people thought could never happen you know and and brother madame talks about how that man is even actually trying to go in and figure out how life where life comes from amen he says they'll get really close and they're almost getting there before the preachers get there realizing where life really comes from we've already realized how that we can take now i guess uh you know cells and put them together and create this and create that and and they're you know doing different things with even the cells that they could have never done at one time but you know before before thomas edison and before uh benjamin franklin they had something in their mind they they imagine you know that kite and that string that power can be controlled and electricity can be controlled and perhaps it can be channeled and perhaps thomas edison had in his mind and in his imagination that you know we can make this ball we can make something and we can take this power and we can actually light this place up and look what we got amen we're doing all of it because man and his imagination it is it is very very powerful i mean the imagination is very very powerful amen your mind let me tell you something how many believes that your mind is very very powerful now y'all remember by the ban i'm saying one place he says that he knew of a man that could take just his mind and burst of glass y'all remember that he could actually do that with his mind to you and me molly he's got to have faith that's got his point i want to get to if man can almost do anything in his imagination hello what can children of god do by the unfallible word of god amen there's only one there's only one difference between imagination and fiction and one is something that people do and the other one is what god's word says one is real and one is not real amen one last one don't last in your mind let me tell you something your mind is a precious thing this morning amen because i want to tell you amen you know there's times that i can go down and the road and i'll be driving down the road and i can think of what perhaps would happen with me if i was in a wreck or you know i was in a ditch somewhere and what call i would be making if i was dying and what i would say or i think about my kids or somebody on a loved one perhaps perhaps if they got to that place and they gave me a call amen and i can cause myself to cry just because of my imagination and really go to boohoo and just because i imagined something doesn't happen didn't happen hope it never does but you can go places and make yourself cry it affects your emotion how many realizes that even the bible talks about how that we are to what meditate upon the lord upon our beds think about him because the things that you think about the things that you imagine the things that goes through your mind affects it's who you are it affects your emotions it affects your feelings it affects every you don't realize it creates your whole thing let me say this that our imagination or our mind and our thoughts brother venom says the mind was a what a womb and that right your mind is a womb a womb is a place where things are born is that right where things are formed where babies are formed in a mother's womb a baby is formed in that mother's womb amen and i believe that even even even mary had to take into her mind and she had to accept what that angel said before she could ever become pregnant with jesus christ and before you and i will ever get anywhere with almighty god you have got to take and think about the word of god and what he said before it will ever materialize to you because barbara said the word of god is a seed now right how many means it's a seed and as you think on these things what does the bible say whatever things are good whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report amen how many likes a good report think on good things and then think on these things now we preachers we preachers use imagination i use my imagination a lot brother branham used his imagination a lot and i looked up on on on imagination and i can imagine i can imagine and i think it was 275 some odd times that brother banned him in telling stories all right amen when he was talking about sarah and abraham abraham and uh no moses and his wife remember moses and his wife on the back side of the desert he said that she was a hot tempered woman he says i imagine they had quite a few things going on back there and that right they had quite some time he would imagine this and he would and brother bannon would dramatize a lot of time preachers dramatized amen i love to dramatize i like to imagine bible stories i like to imagine amen david and goliath and how it was is that right and i can picture the he you know you know that he was on i could picture goliath and what he was saying amen i can picture david going down in between these two hills amen and but you know if if it was ever played back i guarantee you this that hill wouldn't be like i thought the creek wouldn't be like i thought the setting would be completely different because this is just my imagination all right but the bible does describe a hill it talks about a cr a creek of five smooth stones anybody talks about it and so forth you know but we imagine and we kind of dramatize amen and i love to dramatize i love to hear brother branham dramatize about many different things he used many different types many different dramas isn't that right that he would picture and he would get the people even in their mind and to get their picture in there because that's what imagination does it gives you a picture of something amen and it is dwelling and i thought about this could also be kind of the second part two of looking to the unseen is that right looking to the unseen all right so let's look at it because that's what you and i look to we look at things that are not seen how many believes that and i think in second corinthians let me go to it real quick can i read you a couple scriptures here in second corinthians paul said we read it last week he says that while we look not at things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal now we also realize that how many knows that faith prophet of god said that faith is a long range vision how many believe that faith has eyes faith can see things real genuine and that's the difference there's a big difference between you just imagining something really real and faith taking hold and beginning to give you a vision begin to let you see things huh that god's word says god's promises these things and by eyes of faith you see them now i want to say this this morning real clear amen that we get much more excited about things that we see with our natural eyes than what we do with the things that are really real that you can't see with your natural eyes lord help us this morning let's just move a little bit further away from the things that your natural eyes can see and to the spiritual things to the other things that you can't see but yet they are more real how many believes that the things that you cannot see are the only things that are real paul said that the things that you can see with your eyes right here they're all temporary they'll all perish but it's what you can't see that's eternal i'm looking at you and i see us each and every one of you but i can't see that holy ghost that's on the inside but that holy ghost on the inside that's the only thing that's real that soul that's on the inside of this body that's what's real that's what's eternal so we want to turn your eyes away from the things that you can see amen and to the things that you cannot see i want to turn to another to another one amen now another something that sees things but it isn't there it isn't there yet i should have brought my ink pen okay romans 8 romans 8 and the second thing i want to go to and talk to you about that is not seen but yet it's real and it is in our imagination in our thoughts and the things that we imagine and that is in romans 8 and then we begin with verse 24 for we are saved by hope all right we're saved by hope let's talk about hope for a little bit hope but hope that is seen is not hope amen what does the bible talks about the hope that we have which is both sure and steadfast how many's got a hope that's right many many words i could take the whole sermon on just hope the hope that we have you know there's a scripture it says something about always be ready to give a reason of the hope that life in you amen in other words always be ready to testify of the hope that you have brother brandon one time brother brahm do you believe that you're a son of god you believe you're saved you know what he said i hope whoa not a really most of us message you yeah absolutely for sure i know it without it i hope so huh yeah i was shocked i was like yeah he just said i hope i i think if i'm not wrong after that i believe i am i believe it huh because why you believe you're saved but guess what when we get over there it won't be hope anymore it'll be seen we know now you know whether you've got the holy ghost how many believe that because paul says we're saved by hope you're saved by hope we don't hear that a lot either do we no you hope you're saved it's through faith it's through believing god that you're saved but hope that is seen is not hope now another place if in this world we only have hope in christ we're all of all men most miserable in other words i hope i have the holy ghost you better have a little more than that you don't want to have just hope that you have christ you have to have christ you have to be born again you have to be filled with the spirit amen amen for what man seeth why does he yet hope for it but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it amen so a lot of times in the past everything in the past you kind of picture you imagine it we imagine what happened with david and goliath we imagine amen just how it went with the three hebrew children amen you look back but now when you wonder i wonder what laodicea will look like i wonder what sodom and gomorrah was like you don't have to hope yet you get to see what it's like amen all of those things you see them now you see them right there but in the future everything that's in the future you still have to look through the eyes of hope is that right because you don't see it yet how many believe that you know we get in our mind and we imagine in our mind what it's going to be like when we see our loved ones appear when the rapture takes place remember when you get it all figured out knowing you're going to be wrong it isn't going to be like you imagined amen how many knows that was the problem with the pharisees is that they did they have the eyes of their heart opened to see the lord they imagined that he would come to them he would come on a white carpet he would come in a certain way the messiah would come in a certain way they had it in their imagination of how it would come and when it didn't come according to their imagination they rejected it the eyes of their heart was not open god help us this morning i want you to know that if god don't open the eyes of your heart you'll never see christ you won't see him it takes god to open up the eyes of your heart to see him praise the lord we take the eyes the spiritual eyes that we have we take our imagination back to calgary how many believes that oh my even when you come to the altar you imagine that you're kneeling in front of the cross you're feeling in front of jesus christ and you're saying here i am lord now those kind of thoughts and that kind of imagine is not wrong that's correct you have to come down and you believe that he's there because you have to accept calvary and what he did for you on calvary amen even dramatizing the cross as brother bam did amen as he was going down the road and uh the the cobblestone street and we imagined we imagine how it was and but yet it probably a little different what we imagined but we know he went on cobblestone streets and the drug is crossed and then he was going boom boom boom and there he was and he was bloody he had spit hanging on his eyebrow he might spit all over his face and there he was just bloody look at his back if his rib showed amen when he beat him so hard he cuts his flesh open and there he was and he was so weak and shivering because he just didn't have any strength to go anymore and he went down on his knees and he couldn't go no more he met another person picked up the cross isn't that right amen impact before him because he was so weak hallelujah praise be to god i thank god for being able to imagine something like that you begin to imagine that amen and god brings this blessing down because i want you to know amen when you begin to think about him he always comes near how many believes our minds is important the thoughts that you think are important the things that you envision are important amen amen in the days of noah the thoughts and the imagination of man's heart was only evil continually amen what kind of saints and when would we be if our sought for completely holy and righteous always it would bring the presence of god into your heart like you've never seen before amen but we have our mind and our eyes so much on everything that we see the things of this world rather than things that are unseen amen praise the lord so we look here we see it's not the things that are seen that are eternal but it's the things that's unseen that are eternal praise be to god second corinthians two and verse 5 says it this way that's your faith hold on a minute second i'm on first corinthians ii corinthians 5 and verse 7. it says for we walk by faith and not by sight how many beliefs that's what we do every real genuine son of god walks by faith and not by sight what did that prophet teach is that if you're sick imagine yourself well can't move the arm imagine yourself moving that arm begin to think that you can move that arm why because you're walking and living by faith and not by sight you can't look at the symptoms isn't that right you can't look at the conditions you can't look at your human failure you've got to look at the cross it's all about what you're looking at this morning about what we're looking at moses amen when he looked through the eyes of faith it was a supernatural and he esteemed the reproaches of of god greater riches than all the treasures of egypt amen we walk not by sight but we walk by faith amen and so this scripture comes to me and humanity as a whole they pretty much walk by sight the pharisees they walked by sight just about what they could see naturally and i want you to know that before the word of god will ever be a revelation to you before it'll ever become a reality to you god has to open up your spiritual eyes to see amen this scripture came to me let me go in a different direction the kind of direction that kind of led to first this morning and over in revelations i can only imagine so this morning we realized there's all kinds of things there's a lot of things that we can only imagine and then all we can do now is to look by faith we can only imagine it but we know if it's the word of god it is going to come to pass it will happen if man could do almost anything by their imagination amen then much more can we do as sons and daughters of god believing in the word of god and seeing the word of god now notice here first of all i want to read from revelations one and three actually start with 4 chapter 4 to verse 6. two categories of people john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you at peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before the throne and from peace who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead the prince of the kings of the earth unto him now notice this is talking to us unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood amen and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever and then it says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall well because of him even so amen now if you'll notice isn't it peculiar that in the middle of that that he would add in there every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him amen so he puts in there that even those back then are going to see him one day now we see him through the eyes of faith we have seen him and we have heard jesus christ and do great miracles in this generation i mean we know that god is alive and god has come and he has washed us from our sins we have accepted the benefit of believing in him but we're living in a world folks and even these people remember remember these people that pierced him and said away with him away with him crucified and they were saying if thou be the christ come down off the cross we'll believe you god himself he said when every eye shall see me when i come with clouds i want you to understand that even the people that were at the cross even the people that pierced me they're gonna look at me huh and this is why i begin to think i can only imagine what that's going to be like brotherhood what's it going to be like i can only imagine when all the kindreds of the earth and all those that pierced him all those that served and what does he do they're going to see me they're going to look upon me i'm going to show them my hands i'm going to show my side and what is that going to do to those folks what's it going to do to those people that even deny there's a god because how many knows that on the day of judgment the thing that is going to be asked the question that's going to be asked to the people is when he shows himself they're going to know that they rejected something that was really the truth is that right ma it's going to be a quite the day isn't it it's going to be quite today i many times have imagined what judgment is going to be like you know the bible says that jesus when he died went to hell he went to the regions of the lost and preached to those souls that were in prison isn't that right he preached to those souls that were in prison and they rejected him in the days of noah everything that noah said when jesus went down and showed himself i am the son of god i am the one that you turn down here i am turn me down now you can't deny it their hearts will melt they'll be ashamed how many knows you people can deny there's a god they can reject god all they want to but this is what i imagined that if i could have a voice that i could tell to the whole world this morning brother jeff if i could tell the whole world this morning you can put him out of your schools you can imagine that we came from monkeys instead of god created we can do all of that you can you know say that there is no god but i just wanted one thing and that is that according to the bible all right according to the bible there will come a day when you're going to look at him you will look at him someday yeah you have your time now you reject all you want to now you turn your face now you say away with him away with him you say now if thou be the son of god when i see when you see me there those that pierce me you won't be able to say if thou be the son of god they'll know he was the son of god no i didn't come off the cross to prove to you that i was god because you should have believed that when lazarus rose from the dead you should have believed it when our eyes of the blind were healed and so forth that's when you should have believed but you didn't but here's your chance you get to see me again huh even those who pierced him shall look upon me all the kindreds of the world shall see me see if god isn't just going to have a little private judgment somewhere he's not just going to you know condemn them no they're all going to have to stand face to face how many knows they're going to stand before him they're all going to get the opportunity to see him how many beliefs this morning we come to the house of god and by faith we stand before him we stand before him this morning you sit before him this morning he is here now because how many know that judgment begins at the house of god this is where judgment starts this is where we come to judge ourselves and ask for his mercy amen and that's why the first part of this it talks about that is wash this from my blood and you made us kings and priests unto god because we accepted you but this class they rejected him let's look at about four five scriptures this morning can i take my time look at what happens with those who reject almighty god reject the cross those who have pierced him those who don't believe him they'll all believe can we say they'll all believe one day but see god is god is wanting humanity to have a little faith he wants us to believe even though we can't see even thomas had to see is that right amen i like that song uh how many has heard it uh thomas i am a man thomas i am a man look at my hands and look at my feet i am a man thomas i am a man well he wouldn't believe it until he saw it amen but listen so the second part of this it talks about all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen all the mockery is going to turn one day amen i want to go to isaiah let's go first to isaiah and i'll tie as isaiah back to the sixth seal which is in the sixth chapter of revelation okay isaiah 2 and verse 10 enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord amen go in rocks and caves and so forth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of man shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day for the day of the lord of hosts comes that shall be upon everyone that is proud and lofty and upon everyone that is lifted up he shall be brought low and upon all the cedars of lebanon and the high places lifted up upon the observation and upon all the high mountains and upon the hills that are lifted up and upon every high tower and upon every fence wall and upon the ships of tarshish and upon the place pleasant pictures verse 17 the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the hardiness of man shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day and the idol shall idol shall he utterly abolish and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he arises to shake terribly the earth reminds me of how brother bam said that he was over i believe he was in california one time when the pasture fell off the wall and it was such a horrible feeling each and every one of us can only imagine if this morning this building would begin to shake and rock if the plaster would begin to fall and crack open and the feeling perhaps you can only imagine of the feeling that it would be and how we would try to get out those doors as quickly as possible isn't that right and you can only imagine how you'd feel but if it happened you could really feel it but the brandon was feeling that he said it was a terrible feeling and yet one man had the audacity to go out into the streets and say something i figured just what it was he said can somebody remember what that man said some of i think it was he put his hand in the fist and look here it talks about here that people will go into the holes in the dens of the rocks and so forth for fear of him when he rises and the earth begins to shake i can just imagine that can you when california goes down brother brown said it'll shake the whole world when that goes down and when it hits the bottom amen i'm here to tell you right now according to the scriptures people will get religious people will begin to believe in god why because if they even go in there to hide us from his faith they know they got it coming i really don't think man is as dumb as they act they're not as ignorant of god as the act because when these things come even the bible says that they will hide they will try to hide from the face of them god amen okay chapter 13 again verse 6 isaiah 13 6 how ye for the day of the lord is at hand now how many knows that the day of the lord is the tribulation period amen i'll show you this is man's day brother bram says but when the lord raises he's going to have his day and it's going to be his time all right y'all had your time he's going to say all right humanity you had your time now is my time this is the day of the lord the day of the lord is going to be very fierce full of wrath and judgment the day of the lord is at hand and it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt pray calling on god but it'd be too late then how many beliefs well we're in prosperity well everybody's got plenty of money well everybody's driving a nice cadillac or a nice car nice this have a nice house while we have our needs met eating our vanilla ice cream eating our oreo cookies having it all pretty nice hello how many knows we all got it nice this is the time when you've got to look somewhere else this is where you better look at a higher place and not get sucked in from all these delicacies that the devil has to offer that he's offering the world and the people are getting so caught up in it until they are spiritually in poverty amen this is the time amen when the devil offers everything that is to be offered for us to praise god and serve him like never before and to open up our hearts to god and say god here i am search my heart because i'll get to it after a while last thing i want you to imagine is when he comes when you see jesus face to face amen okay so he says every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs of sorrow shall take hold on them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another and their faces shall be as flames i don't know just what that means but usually when you bluff or you're really ashamed of something amen your face turns red behold the day cometh the day of the lord cometh both cruel cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it for the stars of heaven and the consolations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine but that will get people's attention won't it when it gets pitch black and stays like that for a while how many knows it happened what three days was it when jesus died for a good period of time it completely blacked out the sun refused to shine when the god of heaven made the sacrifice for all humanity amen man is so stubborn god show all the signs and the wonders and they steal won't adhere still won't bow still won't realize that they were created by a man by a god-man almighty god that he's there refused to acknowledge can we say something this morning people that go to hell are gonna deserve it they're gonna deserve it god wouldn't send the man to hell that didn't deserve it given every opportunity to get every chance to believe on god in this generation more than ever america more than ever because he had his last great prophet to come right out of kentucky isn't that right and then for us to turn him down with millions and millions of infallible proofs brother bam said the things that happened that he never even told about he says if he was to write books about it there wouldn't be enough parchment hardly to tell the stories of what god did in this generation and still man's heart is just so hard they actually went the wrong direction says we don't even come from god there is no god can you imagine the people how many knows everybody's going to give an account for every word to say people say there ain't no god god's going to look in the face saying i understand you said that i wasn't am i yes god you are the bible says every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess what a day that's common folks what a day that's right ahead of us it's going to be cruel and wrath fierce anger to lay the land desolate stars will be dark and the moon shall not cause to give her a lot and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy huh arrogant yeah their arrogance they'll get a reward for their arrogance of the proud shall cease and i will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible i will make a man more precious than fine gold even man than the golden wedge of no far therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall re move out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts in the day of his fierce anger see how that compares with the sixth seal everybody's familiar with the sixth seal right after the fourth seal the bride is taken up after the fourth seal the fifth seal was souls under the altar and that right speaking of the jews the hitler and eichmann all those souls that were under the altar but when the sixth seal breaks loose hello upon the earth it says in chapter 6 of revelations verse 12 and i beheld when he opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the earth and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell onto the earth even as a fig tree cast as her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places shake terribly the earth hawaii jamaica all the islands are out of their place think about it and the kings of the earth the great men the rich men the chief captains all the haughty huh the mighty men and every bond men every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains city rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that seth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand now can you imagine that the earth's shaking california going down mountains out of their place it's shaking it's rocking sun going down in the middle of the day stars falling it'll get their attention won't it this is just before they get to see him but every eye shall see him all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him how many knows the bible talks about he says you know that if you didn't make it to the wedding supper and if you were unprofitable servant casts him into outer darkness but everyone says that's into the tribulation spirit they'll be weeping and wailing weeping and wailing i can i don't know you can only describe i only noticed how to describe whaling maybe because one of the best illustrations would be at a funeral of somebody that's lost a loved one and is just overbearing the loss of their loved one even brother he said within so many years you know you lose your spouse it's it's something that only only you can understand he says but when he lost his wife he realized he didn't know nothing isn't that right brother david he really didn't realize how bad it was not only those who've lost the spouse can really understand the emptiness the loneliness the pain amen and it would be worse and it would be twice as bad if you knew didn't know for sure about where your loved one went knowing where your loved one then it doesn't make you have to sour like it does for a person that maybe thinks he'll never ever see him again but they're weak they're well they're just beyond it's just unbearable grief sometimes they have to watch people like that they don't kill themselves amen brother branham did he had such grief and pain until he put a gun that he said he couldn't take it no more it was so terrible well you compare that with wailing you talk about wailing you talk about that's what's going to be going on in the tribulation there's going to be weeping and wailing and jesus said all the kindreds of the earth they are going to wail because of him there's going to be some wailing going on when jesus comes when jesus leaves that mercy seat how many knows when he leaves that mercy seat when the last one is saved when the last one comes he leaves that mercy seat and there's no more mercy the blood is taken from the earth isn't that right and god looks down at the sin and he says this can't be in my presence i cannot dissin i don't live with sin in my universe the only thing that's covering the world and allowing them to go on right now is that circle of blood that is over the earth that brother branham saul amen that's what keeps the protection that's what keeps even the sinner protected is the blood that's what keeps you protected amen but how many of those they have to come to that place and they have to come to that judgment amen i can only imagine what jesus did brother branham illustrates it he taught times of when jesus went down to the regions of the law and preached to the souls that were in prison how many knows that when a synod dies they go to somewhere to a prison house i have a scripture on that i'm not sure just where it was but somewhere in isaiah it talks about it talks about that if the ungodly did go like into a prison house and jesus went down there and he said that he preached to those folks those p those people got to listen to a preacher whether they wanted to or not and that's how it's going to be with everybody you might want to deny you might not want to be preached to but jesus is going to preach to you sometime he's going to ask him why didn't you accept i what i did here it is you heard the preachers ah them low life preachers just out of the other go ahead say what you want but ain't nothing but telling you the truth think about god what you want and i'm telling you one of these days they're going to stand before him and i like that he says you know he said they're revelations from the beginning of the whole thing he says all the kindreds there are going to see me they're going to look upon me they're going to stand before me amen over in revelations let's look at the judgment for just a minute all right we ain't too late let's go a little bit further shall we but that's what i imagine that's what i thought when i had that scripture come to my mind i said you know it's something that he said you know and they which pierced me they're gonna see me too i can just imagine what that's gonna be like when those folks that pierced him he said come off that cross if thou art be cry when they stand before him they'll be speechless won't they can you imagine what it'll be like they said after he was resurrected they said you know let's say that he was stolen away the story is let's make a story here and agree with the roman general and the romans there that we're going to put out a story that they came and stole his body away that he didn't really raise all of these things will be brought before him how many knows he says you're not gonna you can't no no no no you can't lie now about whether i rose or again or not now can you no because here i am no people can imagine there's no god they can imagine there's no judgment how many knows they can imagine there ain't no reward for what they do but that imagination is wrong that's wrong imagination because the truth the truth is is that there is a god there is a judgment coming and i wish the whole world could hear me this morning you can deny them all you want to but according to the scripture if it is true you're going to get your chance to stand before it and you will give an account for every thought you ever had for every deed you did and not only will you give account but you will pay you will pay for every doubt for every sin that you ever committed in a burning blazing hell [Music] and brother bam says you can't imagine it being that bad you can't imagine hell being that bad amen so go ahead do what you want but according to the scripture and if it's true you are going to stand before him and i know it's true because i know it works i know salvation works praise the lord all right so before i read this let me read you a quote brother bam says that jesus went to the souls that were in prison in which is hell locked up until the day of judgment because you see judgment isn't now there's no burning hell right now somebody tell you there's a burning hell no not now that's wrong a judge of this earth is good it's enough never to condemn a man until he's brought before a judgment isn't that right how many knows that now you're just in the regions of the lost locked up until the judgment date all right now next one then brother bam says souls in prison now and as i saw the vision of both places he says i have by the grace of god he says and i say not this to be sacrilegious and if it's wrong god for me i believe that i have seen both places in both places i've been i've seen the redeemed and the blessed i've seen the lost and where they're at hallelujah i mean that brother brandon painted us a picture the best that he could he tried to get us to imagine what it's like over there but he said there's no words in the english vocabulary to paint you a picture to get you to really see what it's like over there so every one of us when he tells the story we probably imagine a little bit different but one day we'll know just exactly how it is so he says i've seen both i've seen the loss and where they're at that's why i stand as your brother today to warn you to flee from that downward path don't you never go down that road you've got everything to live for how many believes we've got everything to serve god for that blessed upward way where they're redeemed are in joy and peace they can't sin they can't be sorrow sorry it's just nothing there but perfect that's as much as he can actually say how many knows it's just beyond our imagination how great it is i mean i don't know about you but can you imagine never getting sick never getting old never getting a gray hair never having a funeral procession never having the level you know as good as life is it's just constantly one of our friends is dying moms are dying brothers are dying uncles are dying or somebody's getting sick or somebody getting cancer this is a pest house over there we just can't imagine what it'll be like but i don't know about you but i like to try don't you like to try i like trying to imagine our loved ones appearing huh i like to try to imagine seeing one of our loved ones appear i don't know what it'd be like would you be able to touch them i don't know if you touched them could you feel them i don't know are they just like a ghost they vanish you walk through things if you shook their hands would it go through i don't know but i know your loved ones would appear and i do know this now it comes to mind that jesus says don't touch me i haven't ascended yet am i right but i do know we'll see him now i can only imagine one of these days soon after that between 20 and 30 days you're gonna have a sweep come over your body something won't happen like a tingling i don't know like a sharp pain i don't know but god is going to change this mortal body amen and we're going to see him face to face let me finish this before i get to that listen i've seen both places i know that's an awful statement for a person to make but god being my judge i solemnly believe that i've seen both places and oh far be it for any person ever entering into the regions of the lost if you were standing with hot wires bored right through tormented in every way your fingernails pulled off tormented in any way that you can possibly imagine he said it wouldn't be as bad he's at one place it would be a pleasure compared to what hell is he says tormented in every way it'd not be like that devil torment there is in that place there could be nothing the human mind the my human mind couldn't comprehend what the reasons of the lost is there's no way to explain it and there's no way to explain the regions of the blast this oh my the one is so horrible and the other one is so great so if anybody hears me i'm getting to be an old man and as i read this i can say this morning he's not an old man anymore he's over there right now in the reasons of the blast waiting for you and me yes he is see if i drop dead tonight or today man you could repeat things that i said but i trust you could say he's not here anymore he's over there where he talked about yesterday everybody's looking forward to seeing your loved ones and i want to i want to talk about getting ready for that in closing i don't know according to nature i may not have too many years wait a minute i missed something i'm getting to be an old man i don't know how much longer i've got i'll soon be 55 years old so if you want to know if you're an old man or not there you go according to nature i may not have too many years i don't know where this tape will go but let everyone hear hearing the tape or wherever it may go don't never go down that downward path of the regions of the lost you can't picture hell being that bad and whatever you do don't you never forget this that the regions of the blessed i would say this with saint paul eyes have not seen ears have not heard neither entered into the heart of man the things that god has prepared for those that love him amen how many believes that we imagine that one of these days the lord jesus will come and he's going to do that your imagination is going to come true and when he comes and when you meet him when you talk to him when you come before him remember jesus is getting a people ready to live with him let me just say this i'll read the two scriptures and then give you this final quote okay so just try to pay attention if you can for a few more minutes in the book of jude and in the book of peter how many believes that when we come to church on sunday morning and not just sunday morning and wednesday but every day the one thing that you and i are doing is preparing ourselves for that time you want to be ready to meet him you want to be ready to see him face to face that's why we come to church we say god if there's any way in me that is none like you lord take it out because when i meet him how many believes you want to stand there before him not thinking about having sinned the day before huh or not being right huh how many knows when you come before him there's nothing going to be any you know there's no going to be no secrets everything you are it's all going to open before either you love his appearing and you're waiting for him and you can say god i have been waiting for this time for so long or this morning you're not really ready if he came this morning visibly here saying this is the rapture come with me would you be ready so in jude in jude 1 and verse 24 says now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our savior be glory and majest dominion forever and ever both now and for ever peter says it this way chapter 3 ii peter but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night into which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also in the works thereof there therein shall be burnt up seeing that these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons are ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for huh how many is looking for it i may have an imagination of what it's like and it may be different from my imaginations but i'm looking for him he's going to come we're going to see him looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens shall be on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervor and he nevertheless we notice how this is not for us that's what's going to happen to the world nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth while in foreign dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things i mean he's looking for it be diligent be very diligent this morning that you may be found in him in peace without spot and blameless so my question this morning is are all your sins under the blood are you ready to meet him are you ready when we're going to see him when you're going to see those nails scarred hands hey live brother brown says in souls in prison talk about listen to me so stop if you're listening to this hate turn the machine off even repent if you're not saved get right with god i'm saying this by firsthand experience as i believe it in my heart if the visions has deceived me god be mercy for making such a statement as that but with the sincerity of my heart knowing that not one of the visions ever failed i believe i've seen both places he says far be it from any human being ever going down that downward road now jesus after he finished his ministry preached to the souls that were unsavable that could never be saved now the bible tells us that he went and preached the souls that were in prison that repented not when mercy was given to them they spurned mercy and now they're waiting for the judgment amen waiting for that time when god's going to show him his hands they're going to see him they're waiting for that time then he says oh what a time that must have been oh i wish there was some way that i could shake the world with that with that to let them know what the reality of it is amen the song goes i can only imagine what it will be like when i walk by your side i can only imagine what my eyes will see when your face is before me i can only imagine i can only imagine to be surrounded by your glory what will my heart feel will i dance for you jesus or in all of you be still will i stand in your presence or to my knees will i fall will i sing hallelujah or will i be able to speak at all i can only imagine i can only imagine i can only imagine when that day comes when i find myself standing in the sun i can only imagine when all i will ever do is forever forever

my sins forgiven to walk in your presence to be right with you without holiness no man shall see god don't you think that you're going to see him and be unholy no paul said you be without spot and blameless that's how we want to meet him with our eyes closed stand with me let's not just take this morning's service and just let it slide by us search your heart this morning i want you to imagine looking him in his face right now close your eyes and imagine seeing the lower face i want to ask you do you feel that you're ready to meet him because if you're not ready to meet him now's the time just to come and pray let's take a few minutes we got all afternoon we're not in a hurry if you're not right with the lord this morning and you know that you wouldn't be right to meet him you wouldn't fit right in it isn't something that you've been looking for and waiting for but it would work scary you the coming of the lord scares you whatever it might be if you're not right say say god come and take every spot out of my life lord i have a spot in my life that i'm not what ought to be and i will come to the altar and give you that spot and ask you to wash me by the blood of jesus christ even as revelation said thou hast washed us from our sins washed us by thy blood he's here this morning he's looking at you he's watching you he knows what you have in your heart he knows whether you're right or not he knows whether you're ready to meet him face to face that's what we're here for is to get ready to meet him face to face because we believe him he don't have to come show us his nails ours we already know and believe it he will one day but we'll believe it we are believing it god bless that heart god bless you are you going to walk beside him are you going to be able to sing hallelujah are you going to be able to fall before his feet and see god thank you lord for saving me thank you for all that you did for me he'll reach down his hand put his hand on your shoulder he'll say well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord that's been prepared for you i tugged on your heart you seen your blood you see that you was not spotless that there was a spot and you wanted to make it right i'll never forget i know the morning that you came down to the altar and you said god take this spot out of my heart lord i want to see you and i want to be blameless when i do see you lord we are here at the judgment saying god we stand before you we present ourselves before you lord if there's any way in us that's not right god we've confess it this morning and repent see god let us be ready father if you come this coming week lord to catch your little bride away god we want to be ready and say god i've been waiting for you i've had my dress all cleaned i've had all my garments white my wedding dress is ready i'm ready to meet you lord and i've been here waiting for you i wonder how many could say that in their heart this morning i'm ready and waiting for the lord to come i can honestly say that if you can't honestly say that then your place is at the altar saying god i'm not there's just something i'm not quite ready i'm not surrendered like i should be this morning i want to surrender to you lord god bless those souls god bless those hearts not quite ready there's a spot there's a wrinkle for he's coming for a church that with without spot and without wrinkle or any such thing god bless you richly just talk to him now and that spot that wrinkle whatever it is in your heart he's hearing you he hears you go ahead and speak to him just cry out to him say god i you know i'm not what i ought to be i still need to grow i still need to get rid of this i need to get rid of that i need to have a different mindset my eyes are too much on the things that i could see of this world and not set by faith on the things that are not seen lord i ask this morning each one that is bending down before you your altar god this morning and saying lord jesus take every blot take every spot father me white father this morning lord for god we can only just now all we can do is just imagine standing before you we can only imagine one of these days we realize it's going to become a reality and we're getting ready for that reality god lord the reality of seeing our loved ones the reality of a body change the reality of you coming from the clouds of heaven to take your little bride home lord jesus and to pour out the wrath the fierce wrath of your indignation upon the rejecters of mercy and grace and eternal life that you freely give to them that you paid for on calvary lord jesus we can't ask god that you just take every spot and every wrinkle out in jesus name we ask it let's just sing that little chorus only trust him only trust him this is your time quiet peaceful earth's not shaking good times this is the time to get your heart right [Music] only trust them they try
