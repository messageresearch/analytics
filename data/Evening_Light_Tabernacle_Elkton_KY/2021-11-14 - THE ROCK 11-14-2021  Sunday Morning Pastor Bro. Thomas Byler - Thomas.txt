in thy word hear my voice according unto thy loving kindness o lord quicken me according to thy judgment thou art near o lord and all thy commandments are truth consider mine affliction and deliver me

precepts quicken me a lord according to thy lovingkindness thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth forever god bless you may be seated brother brian good morning brothers and sisters you know that first verse that we we started with it goes i cry with my whole heart hear me o lord and i will keep thy statutes that's what everything we do is based upon our whole heart everything that we have we offer to him we you know you don't hold anything back you give everything of yourself to him and in return he gives you his presence back to fill your spirit you know um before i get started the uh step back a little bit yeah i've been giving you an update right now the uh the building loan that we have left uh we're at about eighty one thousand seven hundred and ninety one thousand dollars uh i'm not hurting the church at all i don't know if we'll break into the seventies this year uh going into the we might uh but like i said we're it's slowly but surely knocking it down uh the last couple of times they've been just wanting me to pay the interest and not the principal so that lets me know that i'm several years ahead of the maturity date of the loan so i thought i'd let you know and one that um there's no other issues um like i said the fuel's all paid for i turned the heat on about almost it's been almost a month and through through the history of running it i found out actually if i turn it off turn it on early instead of waiting to the first cold spot i actually we use less fuel than when i turn on in december or january or december or late november when it gets really cold so it's work out that it doesn't burn with we have a still almost have a full tank we're like it's 71 72 out there on the big tank so you know we might have i know some of you are wanting a mild winter i guess some of us have different ideas about what the winter should be but uh maybe the lord will bless us with a mild winter where we we don't use a lot of fuel and in reserve right now i've told you before we have about twenty two hundred dollars for fuel so we should as unless up major breaks in the church we're we're on pretty good grounds but i was going to read a few of these proverbs before i jump into something else i might be all over the plate this morning you'll have to forgive me for that but i was i'm not trying to be funny here but i was reading this message book and it goes uh it's 8th december 1957 and i was also listening to a message this morning but i forgot to write down the year i should have wrote down the year but it's when brother brown was preaching at one of the indian reservations and it was pretty good i should have i thought i wrote yeah i did write it down it was a march 5th 1954 and that message out that indian reservation god provides our way of of deal of healing you know god provides a way of healing you could say god provides a way of deliverance too and anything you know i don't i'm just one person but you know wherever you're at this morning i'm not afraid to say that i know god's word stands true to that wherever you are at this morning male female young or old god is more than able to whatever your need is this morning to meet it and all you have to do is reach out in faith and grab that promise that god has laying there for you you know i get people can't do it for you they can pray for you they can encourage you they can push you but you are actually in faith have to reach out and grab that promise for yourself and a lot of times that's where people fall short is they they don't have enough faith to reach out and grab that promise and that's the whole purpose everyone's here this morning is that that faith that god lays in your heart will grow stronger that you might be able to exercise exercise those things that god says you need or what you think you need in your life this morning but i was going to read this i'm not trying to be funny but i was just thinking we live in a different day than when he was saying this and this uh i think i mentioned with this message is that i stand at the door and knock it kind of deals with what bro thomas has been preaching uh but you know brother branham talked a lot about about what jesus is standing at the door but i'll just read what he wrote here and uh you know it deals with that painting you know where christ is on the outside knocking and there's no there's no doorknob on the outside for him to get in it's you as the individual you're the only one that has a knob you're the only one that can open the door and let christ into your heart and into your life it's an individual thing you have to do that and he's knocking but i'll just read what it has to say and and i'll start at this 20th verse it's the fourth page in this in this book and the painter said oh no you misunderstand latch was on the outside he would raise the latch and go in but the latch is on the inside the person inside must lift the latch and that's the way it is with jesus with all his mercy and all of his compassion yet you are the person that will let him in or keep him out you have a latch on your side so that's what i goes about what i said earlier everything that will happen to you is based upon you reaching out for it and it goes on what would a man what would a man knock at another man's door for what would be the reason why it's the gain entrance he wants to come in he wants to go he's got something that he wants to talk about or something to show you when someone knocks at your door you know and it just and he goes they're wanting to gain an entrance or a little fellowship or something to talk to you about that's the reason jesus knocks at our door and i was just gonna jump over here but i was just thinking uh he you know how he talks about if caesar augustus was knocking at the door of your house of course she would let him in or if he at this time eisenhower was the president of the united states if the president knocked at your door you would be more than willing to knock him in and i'm not trying to be funny here but you bring it up 50 years later if the if the president or some of the politicians were knocking at your door i i don't know if you'd want to let him in today but i'm not trying to be funny but that's how much in 50 this is not 50 years this is almost 70 years ago how much things have changed but i'll just read what he had to say you know it's not what i say it's what what he has to say that's an important he talks about uh and of course in this world culture we live in he mentioned hitler you know if hitler knocked out a german store of course he would let him in or if you said something like that today they i hate to see what they would say about you today but he goes on this is the 27th quote here and you have to watch the important and this is what i'm thinking about just because someone's knocking at the door you gotta watch his support his importance what's he knocking at your door for what does he want from you you have to look it at it in both ways when christ knocks at the door he only wants your benefit he wants it's something good for you but there are other people that might or other things that might knock at the heart or at your door that you really don't need to let in but i'll just read what he had to say why would would he throw the door open and fell on us well i'm not going to read that at the 20 and you have to watch the importance of the person that's knocking at your door that has to do with it it has a a beggar you might have a right to close the door not to go to the door if you had nothing to give him while you felt ill at the beggar but if he was an important person he goes on to say i would say today if it was president the white eisenhower come here to jeffersonville today and knocked at the door of any good democrat you would feel very much honored to go to the door and welcome president eisenhower though you differ with him in politics you would certainly appreciate him knocking at your door and that's what i'm not trying to be funny but that's the difference 60 70 years later you know they're so people are so opposed to each other that you couldn't have that common ground anymore though they differ with him in politics you would certainly not appreci you would appreciate with him knocking at your door that's why he's the president of the united states he's a man of great importance though you differ with him in politics it would be an honor for any democrat in this city or any other city to entertain the president dwight eisenhower because of his importance as the president of the united states he's a great man honorable man and has an honorable position and he just goes on and explaining it but i just go back to this quote number 27 it has to do with what i was thinking you have to watch who's what's knocking at the door of your heart of the door of your life but you have to watch the importance of the person that you're knocking at your door that has to do with it you know that's you got to be careful what you let in because you might not be able to get it out of your out of your house again but i'm gonna just read a few of these well i'll jump i'll just read a few of these proverbs i was just thinking this morning i was reading some of these proverbs last night when i was down in my office but if you would want to turn it would be proverbs the 14th chapter and and you all know i re i keep read reading that book the pilgrims progress and i was i read the two different there's part one and part two and his wife and christian himself they have the same they go to the same rooms and they see the same things it might have a little different interpretation but the part i was reading this morning has to do where they go into the interpreter's house and they go into that run room and there's a man there with a muckrake and then above him was christ with a crown and then the man never looks up he's always looking to the ground always looking to the world and he never looks up to see what god really has for him it goes to what i was saying earlier about what's knocking at your door you the world we live in is so worldly so consumed with the things of this life and the things of this world that no one ever looks up anymore to what god has formed and i'll read uh about the sixth started about the sixth verse i scorn the seeketh wisdoms in front of the enough but knowledge is easy on to him that understands and that understanding again goes back to what i said in the beginning you have to be able and willing to open your heart to christ the understanding that we desire that we want isn't an earthly understanding but it's a christian understanding go from the presence of a foolish man when thou perceiveth not in him the lips of knowledge the wisdom of the putin is to understand his ways but the folly of fools is deceit fools make a mock of that sin but among the righteous there is favor and you see that in the world we live in right now the things that you call pure and the things that you that you know that are righteous they just laugh at you you know they just think it's they they don't they don't believe you but it's we're past where they don't believe you anymore they make fun of you and we're getting to a point they'll almost be willing to kill you over it again and he goes the heart knows his own bitterness and the strange enough not in the middle with his joy the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish and we all know this scripture here brother branham preached a lot of messages out of this there's a way out that seemeth right on to man but the end there thereof are ways or the ways of death and i'll just finish with that thought whatever wherever you're at this morning wherever i'm at this morning there is a way provided for all of us this morning and that's what we come here for so that god could speak to our hearts and our lives this morning just got to hold hold out just got to believe that god's got a problem it's got something for you whatever it is god was more than able to meet that need brother david uh hey man you love him with all your heart this morning amen let's stand this morning if we could and amen and it's just good to be in the house of the lord this morning and be in his presence this morning listening that little course i am one of the few this morning it's page 464. and hey man are you glad you're one of the few this morning hey man well i am one of you yes i'm one of the few and by faith in god's word i can claim it oh the way may seem long though the opposition's strong for the pride there's a way probably oh if i plan to go through just to hope will not do i must be firmly decided to follow the lord by yes i'm one of and the opposition [Music] just to hope will not live i must be firmly decided to follow the and lord that i'm one of the few amen aren't you glad to be one of the few this morning amen i i always double check the songs and i wrote down the wrong page amen this is 263 it's different now i put 283 but it's 263. amen are you glad it's different now amen once i was lost in sin i had no peace within to save my weary soul i knew but jesus came to me and by his grace i'm free

few weeks ago we've been remembering my sister in prayer she'd had another spot come up on her lungs and they thought it was cancerous and they were wanting to do radiation and she was just really not too keen on the radiation again she asked different ones to pray and we've been praying and she went back to the i can't say what kind of doctor it is because i'd mess it up but went back to the doctor the other day and he told her he said that they just weren't going to do any radiation because that spot had always been there and it didn't look any different than it had when they went back before they took out part of her lung before and he said he just didn't think there was any need for it and she was just praising the lord that it hadn't grown and they said we really don't even know what it is we really don't know that it's cancerous so we're just not gonna do nothing and she was just overjoyed and we just want to thank the church for praying for her and we just just we just know god is an awesome god this morning and you know sometimes we don't we're at our wit's end but we're out of what to do but you know what nothing never excites god whatever we go through and as human beings that's hard for us to understand but god doesn't he doesn't worry he doesn't lose sleep he doesn't get all beside himself because things are going wrong because you know what that song we used to sing in sunday school he's got us all in his hands this morning and if you're his child this morning there's nothing can happen to you that he doesn't already know about aren't you glad for that this morning that he cares for you amen brother daniel and sister annabelle is going to sing this morning we're going to ask them if they'll come this morning yeah i've been saying in like forever uh does anyone remember when uh me and evo sang up here before uh raise your hand okay got a few people um so um amble's the one that's uh with a gifted voice i would have to say me not so much but she wouldn't come up here and sing without me so um anyways i guess i guess that's it it's uh the song uh here i am to worship the same one we said before so all right [Music] light of the world you step down into darkness open my eyes let me see is here i am to worship here i am to bow down here i am to say that you're my god [Music] [Music] me [Music] glorious in heaven above [Music] humbly you came

kind of a nice cool day just a good time for us to just settle in and have a all day service amen and i can't quite hear that brother i hope it's good amen god is good isn't he amen but sadly we'll be with us lord willing wednesday amen so just remember him in service for this coming wednesday other than that i can't think of any announcements so let's bow our heads i can't heavenly father we come before you once again lord thank the lord to be able to assemble ourselves together lord jesus it reminds me of the scripture where you talk to your disciples and you said wherever two or three are gathered together in your name there you would be in our midst so lord you knew we would be gathering together and we're appreciative lord jesus of your promise that wherever we do god gather together there you are in our midst we desire our father this morning that you'll have the full preeminence in the service lord that you would look down in each one of our hearts in our lives to see where we're at with you lord and then to begin to deal with us work with us and lord you know just where we're at you know just what to do you know just what to say to us this morning and we pray father that we just helped me to get out of the way that you might say exactly what needs to be said father we invite you to come in a special way lord and let your presence just be here father anoint us to be able to minister your word by the power of your spirit lord just thank you and praise you for all your goodness and your mercy to us we can't even begin to to mention lord jesus just lord we're here to worship you father and and that's what we come for our father was to worship you in spirit and in truth we ask god your blessing upon the reading of the word the meditation of our heart now in jesus name amen and amen amen my one all right i'm flipping it over now try that all right amen god is good so what did we speak on last was it the shepherd the good shepherd i think it was wednesday night amen so amen i've really amen i'll tell you what i've enjoyed these series i've enjoyed you meant just going down the list here a little bit and glorifying god amen and talking about the lord and his attributes and who he is amen i don't know if i've ever done this before or not i really don't know i may have talked i know i've talked about the attributes of god but i don't think i've ever taken a series on it that i know of because as old as i am i probably don't forgot probably the first four years or something i did it you know but i do know i do remember that uh i used to have a blanket i think up here and showed the different attributes and different things that he is but amen i just feel them felt impressed to go amen and then and take this as a series so this morning amen are you already here what we're going to speak on this morning amen all right so i brought this out this morning amen and of course you can't see it i know because i gotta have glasses to see it this close but and he shall be called advocate uh lamb of god and so forth but this evening or this afternoon or afternoon this morning i mean evening i'm getting it all backwards we want to speak on that right there which is the rock amen the rock he is the rock amen and so amen if you will turn your bibles and we'll go into first corinthians first corinthians hmm first corinthians 10 and i think we could probably just do all scripture reading this morning because i've got quite a few of them amen and so i do want to read quite a few of them but i'll tell you what i'll tell you what when you get into the word of god you realize that you know my word ain't much but we know that his is i mean knows that uh you know i could mess up i could say something wrong but when you read the scriptures you know you're reading something that is not wrong amen god doesn't mess up amen so first corinthians 10 and we'll read one through 12 which is quite a few scriptures but it's kind of an example of something we want to read so he says moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and we're all baptized unto moses in cloud and in the sea and didn't eat all the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ how many believes christ is the rock amen but with many of them god was not pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lust that neither be idolaters as some of them uh them as it was written the people sat down to eat and to drink and to rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur yes some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now these things happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed at least he fall may god had his blessings to the reading words you can be seated so this establishes that christ is our rock how many believe that he is the rock amen that was in the wilderness amen that they followed amen and follow them amen in the wilderness in second samuel i'm going to read another one in second samuel amen david understood what it was like to have a rock in his life what the rock was like in his life amen as i thought about this message i thought about how that david took a smooth stone that he took a little rock right a smooth rock a smooth stone and killed goliath with but how many knows that it wasn't the smooth stone that did it it was the rock that guided the smooth stone amen because that smooth stone would have never found its place if it wouldn't have been for the rock amen in second samuel the 22nd chapter he says david's spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all of his enemies and out of the hand of saul amen into something how that david after he was delivered out of all of the hands of his enemies after god had delivered him right and the hand of saul he said the lord is my rock amen and my fortress and my deliverer praise be to god how many is glad to have a rock now you mean we'll talk about that some of the the other avenue but let me go to another one amen let's go to uh matthew if you will to the book of matthew the seventh chapter matthew 7. talk about a rock in verse 21 it says not everyone that sayeth unto me 7 verse 21 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say unto me in that day lord haven't we prophesied in thy name and in that day name cast out devils and then many wonderful works and then shall i profess answer them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore verse 24 whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken into him unto a wise man which built his house upon the rock amen how many knows it's important to build your house amen upon a rock the real you the inside of you not just some building somewhere but you are the house that he's talking about yourself your soul build your soul upon a rock now how do you do that well we find out these other people they they could do miracles and they'd cast out devils and all these wonderful works but god still said depart from me isn't that right because why did they all be why did it why is god going to reject them on that day the reason that he's going to reject them that day is because they knew better and they didn't do it iniquity it's no better than that to do it and the other thing is and the one that listen the wise man builds upon he is the one that actually doeth what god wants all right let that sink in real good if you're gonna build your house on the rock what do you have to do go ahead do what he says do what he says amen all right and the reigns descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon that house welcome to the storm how many knows we're in a storm this life is a storm this life has a lot of winds to it a lot of strong winds a lot of things that's going to push you over if you aren't careful a lot of things that's going to knock you down amen my and beat upon that house and it fell for it was oh and it fell not for he was founded upon a rock winds blew and beat him on the house and it fell not for he was found upon the rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be like and unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rains descended and the floods came the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it amen great was the fall of it so we find out that if you don't build upon the rock you're going to fall right you can't stand you won't stand amen in acts 4 in acts 4. verse 8 it says then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined for the good deed done unto the impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom he crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him that this man stand here before you hope this is the stone this is the stone which was set at not of you builders which is become the head of the corner amen neither is there salvation in any other for there is no other name given under heaven among men whereby you must be saved wouldn't it be nice to have a loud speaker that goes all across the world to be able to say that right there let all the world know that there is only one name under heaven given whereby you have to be saved i believe it was paul that said you know there is no other foundation laid than christ jesus i mean at least he is the foundation and there is no other foundation and you pour your concr your foundation out of rock out of concrete something solid and christ is the chief cornerstone they rejected the rock i mean that's why titus besieged israel or jerusalem and they were all inside of there boiling each other's children and eating the leaves off the tree in the bark of the tree it's because they reject at the chief cornerstone those who accept that the chief cornerstone escaped out of there before it was besieged because they were had the holy ghost to warn them get out of there in 70 a.d isn't that right they got out of there before titus came in and captured them and killed everybody and knocked the city completely to the ground and they were scattered to all nations amen praise the lord and we're talking about something that is absolutely silent how many knows a rock is solid just comes to me thinking about it i believe revelations are talking about that the stone that was shown out of the mountain right the stone that is shoot out of the mountain amen is going to come and crush all nations to powder grind them to powder which is christ how many of those are going to be ashes under the souls of our feet all evil all we all wrong will be ashes under the feet of the righteous and the rock is going to do it amen now we're we're we're put we are put in this life and in this mortality amen it is all shifting sins i believe it's a song that talks about uh time is filled with swift transition how many believes that it's shifting time is shifting things are shifting you look at america you look at the world in one person's lifetime 100 years and look at how much it has shifted look at how much it has changed amen but how many knows god is the same forever he don't change he don't have to get one bit better ever he doesn't have to change one little bit you and i have to change i'm going to be you and i got to change but god don't have to change amen was it brother neph orman neville i believe it was brother brahm talked about he says you know the thing i like about him is he's always the same amen folks trust me this morning we're going to get right down detail to our lives each and every one of us amen we're going to talk about standing not falling we're talking about not slipping amen not getting the devil to cause you to fall amen and we're going to find out why people are even by the brand of preacher mexico why are there people so tossed about amen we'll find out why but listen so let's go on here it's an important thing this rock is important that's why he called the rock of ages any man any generation that doesn't have that rock goes into apostasy but every generation needed christ they need god because like i said we're in sifting sand if you're not born again you're on shifting sand anything outside god is sinned anything contrary to the word of god is sand [Music] anybody that misinterprets the word is sand amen my time is filled with swift transition now i want you to understand that god wants you to be built upon a rock that rock is unmovable when you're anchored it has to do with the anchor being anchored to this rock amen praise the lord and christ is that rock let's go to jude we're going to go back before the foundation of the world all right how god feels and how important it is let me uh let me go to ephesians first i hate doing this because i've got a lot and i don't want to get confused but we're going to go to ephesians 4 first okay ephesians 4 so i can kind of give you a little better picture ephesians 4 now how many knows it talks about the fivefold ministry and so forth give us pastors teachers for the perfecting the saints for the edifying of the body of christ verse 14 says so that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro amen god doesn't want you be taught he don't want you to be moved once you're on that rock god don't ever want you to move from that rock huh now we just read a scripture in in corinthians there where they had that rock they had christ with them but if every example of how these people were constantly slipping they were constantly being moved with every temptation with every time they got thirsty they murmured they complained when they got hungry they remembered they complained right they never just stay with the rock and i find that there are some people that claim to be christians but they're always being moved about huh just the least little flame can just waste and that's where israel was god wants you to get on that rock and stay on that rock be unmovable don't be tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men amen by cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive all right speaking but speaking the truth in love now in jew jude 1 and verse 4. let's go to verse 2 3 i mean beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints for there there are certain men prepped and unawares who before of old were ordained unto this condemnation ungodly men now notice turning in that right turning the grace of god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the lord having saved the people of out of the land of egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not in other words that ones that were moved i want you to understand something that it is the soul ambition of the devil that if you have got the holy ghost and you have god you're founded upon the rock the devil will do anything just to move you [Music] just to get out of that position of being in christ he wants talk his head off just to get you to sway you a little bit just to move you a little because i was thinking about this now think about brother branham how did he used to have some kind of toboggan slide and they used to be ray up i guess and it would be a slide and they would play because they'd love to slide down but they play over around the edge of that slide and all of a sudden guess what they got too close and down you went he says that what america has done they got too close to sin and now look at where we're at i had to think of where america would be at when we serve god and when we believe god when we trusted god if we didn't just stood still huh but people are never happy even when they claim to be christians they're just not happy it's just not enough they want something different huh that's where you get in trouble just not content amen israel never was or they rather than just being content to be hungry huh i mean as god let him get hungry godliness with contentment is great gain paul said i know how to have i know how to not have i know to be hungry how to be full but there's one thing i've learned that i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me no matter what condition he was in he was always thankful amen he was content so israel here is saying afterwards they were destroyed because they believe not and then we go way back to before the foundation of the world we go plumb up into heaven and the angels which kept not their first estate amen how many believes it's important to know where god wants you oh it's vital that god you know where god wants you when god blesses you where you're at huh when god is blessing a church when god is blessing you as an individual and that's where you ought to be it the devil will do his absolute most to get you out of that blessing because you step out of that where god wants you and guess what's happening god can't bless you can't do it you can't be in the permissive will god and be blessed no you talk about a whooping you talk about hard times when you get out of the will of god and the devil the devil's ambition in heaven was to move these angels out of the place that they were huh out of the place that god wanted them and he is shrewd he is smart he will make it look like it's a light when it's actually death he comes as an angel of light amen just to get you to move out of that place and when you move out a little bit but it won't be long poof down you go huh when i thought about that look they didn't stay with god did they the devil amen he talks about his cunning crafting us over there in ephesians he's so smart that he received those angels he they complained against god the devil complained against god whatever his name was at the time i'm not even sure but it wasn't the devil or lucifer i don't think huh but anyway whatever his name was he persuaded him that you know god there's a little bit something wrong with him he gets all the glory we don't get any glory the devil ain't smart how many knows that was date he jumped right on date and corey you know moses you get too much glory we don't get enough glory that's the devil glory lord let me become the doormat so people can wipe their feet on me huh yeah that's right but think about it just to get him to move out of the place that's what the devil tries to do he gets you to move out of the place where god wants you and i'll tell you what all right let's go on from jude i believe it's hebrews 2 it says we should be careful at least at any time we should let him slip and that right how many knows it's easy to begin to slip people begin to slip and pretty soon you're so far away from god get to church you can't clap your hands anymore can't raise your hands anymore just dead as a doorknob ain't long don't take long at all it can happen in a few days if you just let the devil push you around huh just to begin to let it slip let your prayer life slip forget about praying in the morning or noon or evening time and guess what it ain't long and you're all dirty no fellowship anymore folks i'd like to get up every morning and thank god for this beautiful day that he's given me for one more day to worship you to magnify you to glorify you lord oh my notice here it says kept not their first aid but left notice they left their own habitation amen and left the place that god had put them [Music] you get where god wants you to be and stay there and sometimes you might fall on your knees because you can't even stand anymore you don't know how to stand but just stay with the lord and watch there's not a devil in hell that can move you not a dev there's not enough imps out of hell to move you amen was it galatians or somewhere paul says i'm so shocked that you are so soon moved you're so soon moved why amen in james i believe it's just a few pages back james 1 and verse 6 says it this way but let a man ask in faith not wavering not this is the point i want to make he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed amen both today even the prophet god god said there's nothing that takes the place of a godly king and even talk about democracy is good but it won't last it's all sales and no anchor and all right look at how the world's being tossed get away from christ and find out how far you get tossed how much you'll waver if you waver huh you're not on the rock like you ought to be you don't have to waiver when you're on the run david even though that giant looks so huge am i right he didn't have to worry he was not wavering he was not tossed he stood up there like a man now let me just make a statement the closer to the rock you become the more like iraq you are are you glad for that the closer you are to the rock the more like the rock you are and folks we need dads to be a rock we need pastors to be a rock you dads you're supposed to be the rock of your family ask dad he'll tell you what you ought to do look at that he does it the way it's supposed to be done not well no i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know huh no you're the rock don't make your wife have to be the rock because that's where it falls on when you're not the rock amen how many believes we need to be close to the rock daniel was close to the rock and they threw him in the lion's den he was not moved three hebrew children they were not moved huh david was not moved all these people were not moved once they come upon the rock folks how many beasts we all need a rock without christ you're not going to amount too much because you're on shifting sands amen he that wavereth he that wavereth amen is like the wind and tossed amen over in ephesians let's go to ephesians now wait a minute we already was in chief ephesians so we'll go to second thessalonians 2 thessalonians 1-4 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that you that ye be not soon shaken amen in mind or be troubled neither by spirit oh how many knows i know what it's like to be troubled in my spirit amen nor as by letter as from us don't even let anything we write disturb you as the day of christ is at hand and let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first how many believe that know that out there say this those who are anchored to the rock are about four to one huh and it may be more than that but i just take my analysis off of what jesus said some fall by the wayside some follow you know the tribulation comes and it was about four different categories i believe it was huh but there was one that brought forth a hundred fold isn't that right it took root all the rest all withered rest were taken away amen there will come a falling away first and a man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called god let me tell you when to never get you to move then he knows he's got you he is in the place that god's supposed to be amen so that he has god sitteth in the temple god showing himself that he is god my point is in the second verse don't be soon shaken in mind don't be troubled amen how many bleeds out when you are standing on christ the solid rock you don't have to be troubled you don't have to let your emotions rule what if i wrote down here you don't have to have personality changes huh you don't have to be up one day down one day in and out of this and not the other your emotions huh if you don't have christ if you don't have your emotions under a check of the holy spirit the rock your memory your feelings everything else you'll be well it's only the rock that brings stability to your life amen makes you solid how many believe this is this is necessary today kids this is necessary today you've got to get anchored in the rock there's too many appetizing too many tantalizing things out there that your flesh will want huh your flesh will desire could i say something teenagers if you don't get christ in your life as your rock you're going to want a husband so bad that you'll go out there in the world and get one you will do everything that's contrary to what the prophet said because you have a desire for a mate you have a desire for companionship and you will absolutely fall the only thing that will hold you is if you've got an experience down here and then you love god more than what you like what your flesh would amen is that good give the lord a handset that's the truth that's some truth you'll be tossed that emotion will toss you because there ain't none of us ain't no young person that doesn't want a mate at least not that i know of huh there's something they can do without i guess but they had to fight some mergers somewhere that's for sure because i don't know about you but i come to the place when i wanted to get married i said i've been alone enough i want to share my life with somebody amen and before that and that was around 21 years old before that i had no interest in being married huh right how many believes you got to be ready to get married before you get married amen and thank god for who he gave me amen i thank god every day all right so don't be tossed how many beliefs evening like tabernacle it's time to steady up oh i have quotes brothers and sisters let me let me just can i say tell you something brother urban says i come by a harbor one time and i seen that we was flying on a plane coming down low and there was a great peak ship down there the sails had been let down and oh the storm of the sea it was tossing it was terrible and i seen the old ship they're rocking back and forth and some waves that go in over the top and under and everything and wonder why this is and the fellow said you know he's like why doesn't it go down and this man says it's got a sea anchor on it see the ship can't sink i'll go through the waves hey man some ways to go under me some over some around but as long as i've got that anchor it will not say sorry for getting a little excited but i'm a witness i'm a testimony of that folks i've had waves higher in this house seem to come by hello amen big waves that was going to take me down that was going to drown me it's going to stop me eliminate me if it wouldn't have been for the anchor let me think about whether i want to say this or not you know amen should i only if it's the lord right folks whenever that wave when that wave was coming i even asked my wife i said honey do you just want to quit she said no and folks i hinged on my wife's word i said lord if she don't want to do it i ain't gonna do it i'm done but that ain't it wasn't there it was him it was him that anchor it held i'm here today because i know what i'm talking about when i talk about their being anchored in christ you have to be anchored in christ there ain't nothing ain't nothing else going to hold you except that anchor in christ and every young person you have to have and brother brian says it all the time it can't be over emphasized that you got to have a personal walk a personal relationship with jesus christ that's really what matters when brother branham toss preached that message called why are the people so tossed he clearly explained that there's two the reason why people are up down and out is because they have it mentally and they're right they have it mentally but how many knows even jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church and what was that rock upon the spiritual revelation of who jesus christ is that he gave his life that he died for you that he is a personal fellowship with you that he forgave your sins amen upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall i love that and o t and o t and o t and o t and o t shall not prevail against it that's not my word that's his word shall not prevail against it can i say something that's why you said yeah say it not even i will stop it not even yourself will stop it if he started to work and you get rebellious he'll crash your car and take you home he's not going to lose a one of his how many believe aren't you glad for that hang on to your seats isn't that good to know that god starts working you you have something in your heart that holds you through this storm and holds you through that storm you've got reason to run the isles you've got reason to come out of your seat you've got reason to say thank you jesus no i didn't hold on i wanted to give up but he held on to me but even said he said it's not you holding on it's him holding on i was saying somewhere maybe a few nights ago and i wanted to preach so bad i preached to my wife in bed till 12 o'clock just telling her how glorious jesus was yeah i like doing this every sunday on wednesday a text come on my heart it just kept burning so great till i just couldn't rest with it and i said honey i want to preach you a little while and she rose up about his by grace and listen to me and i said a christian's faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a christian is not tossed about they're not tossed to and fro with every when the doctrine they're not costing flu and fraud with every emotion that comes along huh how many believes a real christian is not toast you're not like a wife you're not like the wind you're like a rock you don't move you don't move a christian doesn't fuss no lord don't come to the altar right now be full ah my nose be like a fuss but a christian don't fuss and fume and worry about things praise be to god a christian rests i've anchored in jesus the storm of life i breathe i've angered in jesus i fear no in the way i've anchored in jesus the storms of life i breathe off anchored in the rock of ages i'm just glad if you ever anchored on the rock of ages i'm gonna shrivel up oh i like my brother i don't care how pretty you are i don't care what kind of a moose are you are i don't care if you're arnold schwarzenegger or all of them guys you're gonna shrivel up and die all them stars are shriveling up and dying but if you're anchored to the rock you have eternal life that's what we need you may have 70 million they may have all kinds of their houses may be worth 250 million huh more money what we know what to do with huh but where's their soul amen where will they be when we gather around the throne and the gates are closed within i'll be shouting glory glory when the saints go marching in where will they be folks you better get anchored every young person if you haven't got that anchor that you this word of god and the holy spirit is more to you than anything else any of your emotions anything else more than the pastor if he's wrong more than the parents of their own no more uncle and whatever doesn't matter i want to be right with god i want to build my house upon a rock i want to do what that bible says folks i had somebody text me yesterday and apologizing for something i ain't going to say oop but you know what i admired that seemed like a little thing but when a little thing bothers you it tells me a lot about you oh my why because every one of us will not do what the word of god says if you have it right down here we want to be right amen you love him oh that's right worry about things the christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at calvary don't you just love it how people will come to you and when you're a christian you say well now what about where the bible says this and it says that over there and it looked like it contradicted itself or well like paul said they minister questions huh what is that most of the time that's the devil he's trying to sneak in try to get you to doubt a little bit make you wonder a little bit huh just stay out i'm already sold i'm resting please i'm resting oh he came to a lot of preachers preachers we know that we could mention they don't even believe the prophet anymore they'll say all kinds of blasphemia things against him folks it's a blasphemy to me if i haven't been a preacher for 20 years and then to say he wasn't the prophet or he was a false prophet oh oh hell's going to be hot for you sir it's going to be hot yes sir it will because there's no question huh it'd be different if the prophet was standing here how many knows he would tell you exactly what you're thinking now don't think that huh i can stand here as a preacher saying hey you shouldn't have thought that because he had told you you ought to thought that that was the devil putting doubt in your mind and because your dad was a preacher you became a preacher huh oh boy i don't know if i'm prophesying here or what but that's how it was and there was something that was not a real experience he's just following his dad he thought his dad was right my dad is right my dad just find that your dad is right but you better have the revelation yourself because if you don't you'll eventually fall away yeah the devil will be able to persuade you out just like your dad could persuade you in huh amen how many believes it [Applause] you're just convinced in your mind and not in your heart somebody else is going to unconvince you in your mind amen all right let's go on i liked it it's all finished at calvary for the believer oh that's right sickness may come disappointments but the christian is at rest knowing this that god is able to keep that which he has promised and performed and started isn't that right right knowing that no matter what the thing is or how it looks there's neither sickness nor death nor sorrow starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus amen all right psalms 46 psalms 46 intensives be still be still and know that i am god i believe the prophet of god says you know the pentecost in the church world he says man if if people would just hold still long enough god could work on them people just can't sit still they're always looking for new things something different how many knows oh right there i believe it at the red sea god moses said just stand still just hold still when you come to places you can't cross can't get through don't get all upset hold still folks i believe it's time people hold still be still those angels in heaven should have just kept still just stay in your place say where god wants you can i tingle your mind a little bit how many believe that perhaps when we get over to heaven brother jeff we'll meet the two-thirds of angels that stood still you'll be able to say to those angels was you tempted you'll probably say yeah yeah we heard that we heard that going around our church yeah he was going everywhere man he was flossing and he prospered but we said whoa i'm just going to stay right where i am huh the two-thirds i'll have that testimony they were no doubt tempted never tried to get on huh but they just held still hostage johnny's just hold still and see the salvation of the lord amen see his salvation i want to talk to those angels stand still if israel would have just stood still when they got hungry when they hurt the chariots coming amen i believe we need to stand still if there's ever time to hold still be rock solid folks let me tell you something that's why a pastor you know one thing i didn't say about the sheep but prophet god talked about the sheep had it every night every sheep gets counted every sheep gets counted every night to make sure they're all there and as a shepherd i can tell you this that when people are missing on wednesday night or especially sunday morning huh people are missing like hey where are you are you sick are you okay that's why i appreciate when people let me know hey we're going out of town we're going on vacation so i know where you're at that the devil hasn't put something in your mind that you maybe need help with because he's good at that a pastor cares about his sheep amen and so don't think nothing of it if i check on you if you're missing amen it's just caring stand still right i believe we need to stand still peter and not peter but paul said to the ephesians he said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places whoever take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand come on somebody say stand stand having done all to stand stand therefore stay where god put you amen wherever that is wherever it is that god puts you stand there amen why i'm you know in christ is the best place to stand if you're in christ grounded in christ that's the best place to be the peace that passes understanding that's good enough for me amen the joy that's unspeakable and full of glory amen why would you want to leave that having done all to stand stand therefore don't be tossed about with every emotion how many fights emotions how many thoughts moves we are booty huh we can be moody how many knows it takes prayer to overcome those moods that's right the closer you are to christ the less moody you'll be your emotions and feelings will be in check why because you're gripped and solid that's all talk about being so close to god talk about being close to god close to that rock having that rock in your life so much until you become like that wrong i think david was an example joshua was an example caleb was an example but in our modern age i like this guy his name was stonewall jackson and he'd get in a battle and the bullets would fly through his coats and everything else arrows fly through his coats and barely miss him and he's standing right there in the middle of his man come on man fire that musket come on fire let's go come on huh he wasn't back in the back building with his head down say y'all go fight him no he was a brave man and that right and they said man what what is this little guy this little guy what is what is with him how can he do that they came up to him and formerly ask him mr jackson how do you do it how do you just stand there like a stone wall kick the dirt he says well i don't take a drink of water but when i thank my lord for how many knows he was close to the rock and it made him like a rock folks the water don't tell me too much other than what it tells me is that it's not so much about the water it was about his relationship with the rock it meant that he had a close relationship with the rock i take that as an example i when i eat my food thank you lord for this food when i put these clothes on thank you for these clothes when i eat whatever it is i thank you lord for this because i know it comes from your hand how many knows when you thank god for everything he appreciates that because i don't know anybody who doesn't doesn't uh appreciate when they are appreciated how many knows we all need to be appreciated we all want to be appreciated we should thank him in all things give thanks amen praise the lord he was like a stone wall having done all the sand stand therefore now i want to say this in a world that's swiftly changing church people every one of you stand strong be careful why because the devil is a roaring lion he is shrewd as can be to deceive amen and here is another really good one i don't know if i have much after this maybe one or two but let's go to psalms i like david's psalms psalms 1. i like it blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate day and night you know i'm still working on that i've gotten to where i'll get up on my roof i'll get out there on my walls that i'm building or whatever work i'm doing now i'll take me a tablet only used to not do that but i'll take me to keep me a tablet long keep my mind on him through it all then we got quicken something i'll write it down huh day and night keep your mind on him why because how many of us knows that's not too easy to do because we are so busy but how many knows every time in the old testament talk about tied upon your best boat met it upon it in the night watches and everything else if you want to be a stronger christian have him on your mind a greater portion of your time all if you can it's the light is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season and his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen i mean he believes that's what we want to be like a tree that's planned by the word how many knows planet in that word and it doesn't matter how many storms come or what comes you'll be able to withstand those storms and that wind those temptations of the flesh amen just like stonewall jackson was he was like a tree that was planted there oh my that believes that that bullet can't hit him until it's god's time for that bullet to hit him that right he trusted in god remember this there's angels the angels of the lord are encamped around about those that fear him you talk about a shield huh maybe we'll talk about a shield sometime but the shield of god because he is our shield and our buckler but it protects you amen just like a tree that's planted by the water i shall not be moved how many wants to be that away amen amen let me recap the answer recap your answer for why we are so tossed about so many times while we have personality changes mood changes huh and so forth it's because we aren't grounded upon the rock the way that we should be why when winds come when this comes along everything it changes us this comes along it changes us how many knows we don't need to be that way no matter what comes it shouldn't change you amen sure we i know we all have our ups tonight we all have these here but let me tell you it balances it out right it brings you back into direct perspective when you go to your knees and you talk to the lord about it and it brings into the right atmosphere amen you love the lord this morning so let me tell you church let's make sure that you have built your house upon the rock not because brother byler said brother bother preached it no but because you know it personally that's why we get amens that's why we have that's right why because we have responding you're responding to what you know to what you have experienced because if it isn't that it's still just hearing my words it's still just here in the bible it's still wearing what your mom daddy said it's all good but it has to come much deeper than that if it's ever going to stand against the devil and all of hell and prevail against the gates of hell if it'll ever prevail against that it has to be personal with between you and jesus christ amen your walk with the lord and then in closing it'll be like paul said romans 8 and verse 30 5. he says who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness look these are all terrible things that paul's mentioning i mean he's not mentioned all the highlights the peace and the valley and all that no he's saying all these things that you come against that's going to come against you huh if you've lived very long be a christian you'll know that if you're on the right path it isn't long or tries to get you off one way or the other and if you're a wise christian you'll know exactly what that is when it happens come he knows because if you aren't wise if you haven't learned it you'll learn the hard way because you'll get caught up in it and then you'll find out hey you know should have never got caught up in that devil's lie that he talked to me in my mind huh what shall separate nakedness apparel or sword as it is written for we are killed all day long for thy sake we are counted as sheep for the slaughter but nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded i mean note paul knew what it was like to be found to fall on the rock this is the man who was absolutely founded upon the rock he had no worldly treasures whatsoever flat broke a bum had to hey god had to supply him with whatever he had had asked him to bring my coat along it's cold i need my coat can i just have my coat huh sometimes he'd have plenty sometimes they've got absolutely nothing it was basically he lived on the lord huh and he was persuaded that not death i'm it's not even death oh my how many believe i don't know about you but as i got older aches and pains come on folks when you get older you better just start to learn the laugh and aches and pains because they're there you know i know brother brian's getting a little older and i know he's got aches and pains but i never hear him talking about it i never hear him complaining about it huh i guarantee you i could probably listen some stories but he's the kind of man right hey he's just going to go through it i like that i mean it was because we don't want to be complainers that's right we're just gonna don't be a complainer about every aid campaign i've talked to people that were like that and it's depressing you know to pray oh i tell you what i just can't get around and oh i tell you what my knee hurts no i'm telling you what my foot hurts and i could do that folks i've got this that in the other but shrug it off and say hey at least works fifty percent now i'm thankful for the fifty percent all right i hope that helps somebody that's getting older but not even death paul said even though you come up to that door of death don't let it shake you don't let it separate you from the love of god don't let it stir you up don't let it disturb you amen amen or life nor angels messengers preachers huh not principalities or powers nor things present nor things to come not height not depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love which is in christ jesus our lord lord thank you jesus that we can be that kind of people to where nothing moves you stand with me if you will i could have an altar call and i'd be the first one there when you would ask me brother byler are you up and down or are you like that rock this nothing move you know i'm not there yet but i'm getting there i mean it's with me how many would raise your hand and say yeah i'm not there yet i'm not there yet but i'm working on it god is working on it with me amen remember if god is working on it that means he's still sending you trials the wind is blowing and sometimes you lose it huh sometimes you get upset you realize later you know i really shouldn't huh i'm sorry that's what you got to do just i'm sorry hey if you're if you're saying you're sorry you've learned a lot you've learned how to get back how to get right how to get back up how to start over again i'm sorry i shouldn't have and then learn i the lord was teaching us with our heads vowed this morning let's go before great rock lord jesus we know that you are the rock in our life and father we confess many hands went up confessed lord we're still not the way that we should be in that manner lord jesus the word no wind no doctrine nothing moves me i know where i am i know what i'm supposed to do i'm in christ and nothing no temptation no lust no preaching no false doctrine nothing that tries to get me out of the place that i am is going to prevail my emotions my personality sometimes we change a little bit yet lord and we're here to confess lord we're not what we ought to be yet lord you've seen the hands help us each one in here father especially of us who have put on christ and claim to be filled with the holy ghost help others to be able to testify brother so-and-so i'll tell you what that person it doesn't matter what they're going through they're always the same they're calm they're straight they're serious they're godly they handle it the right way they don't get all frustrated and fuss and fume and stood about you can see christ you can see that rock lord we ask god that you'd help us to be more like that from this morning on lord jesus help us be faithful to what you've said lord help us to be the same always lord jesus because you're the same and help us to keep our prayer and our relationship with you where it should be father so that our emotions our feelings and our our temptations the different things that this flesh pulls us in a wrong way oh i don't want to go to church this morning i don't feel like it this lord help us get all of that in check for jesus and let you have the preeminence in our lives lord for you are the rock of our salvation you are our rock we can say like david you are our rock and our fortress you are shield you are our strong power and help us lord to be lord like that ship that had its anchor in that rock that no matter what the waves do it can't be sunk it won't drown because it's founded upon that rock lord lord jesus the devil can't pull us away from you from the love of god because you've anchored our soul in that haven of rest we thank you this morning and confess our sins and our shortcomings this morning i ask that after this morning you'd help us lord to realize that we have to have that rock in our lives every day to make us like christ in jesus name amen and amen i want to sing that song with you i
