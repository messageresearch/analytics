[30:27] for me and just giving my life
[30:30] to into just placing my life in his

[30:39] i was just
[30:40] crying and
[30:42] and uh praising the lord and singing and
[30:44] i
[30:45] i just can't i just can't believe this
[30:49] experience
[30:50] and it was
[30:52] it was a
[30:54] solid
[30:55] experience
[30:57] it was just
[30:59] it was overwhelming i i ran the aisle
[31:03] just just for that experience i i can't
[31:06] believe it and i just couldn't let go
[31:09] for a long time and
[31:11] before that
[31:13] i
[31:14] it was
[31:15] they they had already let out everyone
[31:17] before that i i had to
[31:20] i could have just left if i i was
[31:23] thinking i was fighting within myself i
[31:25] was fighting with the devil that he was
[31:27] trying to tell me uh oh you could go
[31:30] tomorrow you could you could
[31:33] you could wait till tomorrow and he
[31:36] he nearly he nearly won but i
[31:39] i just stayed there i just waited and
[31:42] then
[31:43] then i just went up there
[31:45] and it was just a
[31:47] leap of faith for me
[31:49] and i
[31:49] [Music]
[31:50] but
[31:52] even after that the devil is still on
[31:55] you and he
[31:56] what he did
[31:58] he at
[32:00] every
[32:01] gun in hell will be on you when you get
[32:03] when you get on jesus side when you
[32:05] when you
[32:06] truly
[32:07] get on his side and
[32:11] i feel that the devil attacked me after
[32:14] that
[32:14] what he did is it was just a
[32:17] misunderstanding and just i took it so
[32:19] hard and i was i was in
[32:23] i was just in the dorm and i i started
[32:27] crying i
[32:28] i
[32:29] i had a
[32:31] a um
[32:32] a friend he he prayed with me
[32:35] and i i felt
[32:37] i felt
[32:39] i felt that
[32:42] i i had to go talk to that to a man that
[32:47] that had them this misunderstanding it
[32:50] was about me this misunderstanding i
[32:53] couldn't
[32:54] it was it was so
[32:58] so
[33:00] uh
[33:01] it was so difficult to
[33:05] to face this
[33:06] but
[33:08] i
[33:10] what i did was i went i figured i
[33:12] thought about it in my head what what
[33:15] happened where what what was it what was
[33:17] that misunderstanding
[33:19] and i finally figured it out i
[33:21] i
[33:22] i don't want to name any names or
[33:24] anything i just want to just say that
[33:26] i
[33:27] i figured it finally figured out
[33:30] what what was that misunderstanding i
[33:32] went back and talked to
[33:34] the man and i uh
[33:36] i got clarified with him i i figured it
[33:38] out completely it was just
[33:41] it was it was nothing really
[33:43] and uh the devil just just messes with
[33:46] your mind
[33:47] he he he will change things
[33:51] the smallest things misunderstandings
[33:54] anything he will he will twist him he

[37:17] all right turn with me if you will to
[37:21] um let's see
[37:23] john 10 27.
[37:34] there's many out sick to
[37:38] today and i can come in to church i
[37:41] believe that there a lot of them or most
[37:44] of them are watching through the service
[37:47] to streaming the service through
[37:49] facebook
[37:52] and
[37:58] see
[38:00] my sheep hear my voice and i know them
[38:02] and they follow me
[38:04] i get give unto them eternal life and
[38:06] they they shall never perish neither
[38:09] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[38:13] amen and may god add his blessing to
[38:15] reading the word you can be seated
[38:24] it's a very familiar
[38:26] scripture right here
[38:30] my sheep here hear my voice
[38:34] it it's it's that that same
[38:37] voice
[38:38] that
[38:40] that that um
[38:42] was spoken of in in in
[38:45] god's word
[38:47] that that voice and
[38:49] it's always saying with the word it's
[38:52] always
[38:53] it's exactly what the word any any voice
[38:56] that you hear
[38:58] that's
[38:59] contrary to this word it's not from god
[39:03] and
[39:06] and here what what brother branham and
[39:09] was saying in uh in the voice of the the
[39:12] sign
[39:14] and every true sign every
[39:17] true sign that's sent from god
[39:19] has a voice behind it now don't
[39:23] oh don't fail this is my last session on
[39:27] this see
[39:28] every true sign
[39:31] now we have signs that's not from god
[39:33] satan can almost impersonate everything
[39:37] that there is but a true sign sent from
[39:40] god has the voice of god behind it
[39:44] god
[39:45] said to moses if they won't believe the
[39:47] voice of the first sign
[39:49] then and do this other sign before them
[39:52] and then if they don't hear that
[39:56] just just take water and pour it upon
[39:58] the ground and that that was a sign that
[40:00] they would be drenched
[40:02] there in in their own blood
[40:05] notice and just the same as he said dust
[40:08] the dust from your feet it'd be a more
[40:11] tolerable for sodom and gomorrah that
[40:13] day than it will be that at the city
[40:16] that rejects you
[40:20] and and and over here it says
[40:22] uh in somewhere else what brother
[40:25] branham says now this
[40:27] had been promised by god and he that
[40:30] that was
[40:32] he was going to deliver his people with
[40:34] a strong arm now uh when
[40:37] this word he didn't call a priest he
[40:39] didn't call a rabbi he didn't call any
[40:41] executive
[40:42] he called a shepherd
[40:44] out on the on the mountain a runaway
[40:46] born for ordained prophet that didn't
[40:49] want his job
[40:51] when you hear people desiring to be this
[40:54] that or the others or something just
[40:56] watch god never uses them god had to
[40:59] hunt moses down and get and get him he
[41:01] had to hunt paul to
[41:04] get him he it's it's
[41:08] man that's
[41:10] that that don't want to do it
[41:13] they don't want things that then and god
[41:15] takes that man
[41:16] he won't won't do who so so he can show
[41:20] his glory by it
[41:22] i mean that's exactly right while i was
[41:25] saying on on sunday to uh
[41:28] to brother micah i said that god doesn't
[41:32] god doesn't um
[41:34] call
[41:35] the
[41:36] he doesn't and call the qualified he
[41:39] qualifies the call
[41:41] see
[41:42] if
[41:43] i i didn't think i was going to be
[41:46] a preacher i thought i didn't have it in
[41:49] me i had stage fright i was so bad at
[41:53] at speaking and
[41:55] even speaking to people just just
[41:57] one-on-one conversation because i i was
[42:00] and i still still am an introvert but
[42:04] really an introvert like i couldn't
[42:05] hardly talk to anyone and i would just
[42:07] get really nervous just talking to one
[42:09] person
[42:11] but but that that's that's the way god
[42:13] does it he
[42:14] he qualifies
[42:16] the call
[42:18] and
[42:19] and what
[42:20] i want to
[42:22] speak on
[42:23] tonight
[42:25] is
[42:26] is um
[42:28] hearing the voice of god
[42:30] and
[42:32] because there's so many voices is that
[42:34] you hear all the time
[42:36] there's voices that you hear on the
[42:38] media there's voices that you hear
[42:41] hear other people tell you and and
[42:43] different and things
[42:45] and what one of the main things that
[42:47] that really
[42:49] got to me
[42:50] when i
[42:51] when i was talking to
[42:55] let me just find it right here
[42:58] i i was talking to to um
[43:04] where is it let's see
[43:06] so i'm on my note somewhere
[43:14] yeah here it is you are you are not your
[43:17] thoughts you are the one listening to
[43:19] them
[43:20] that that's that's really deep because
[43:22] because most of us or all of us
[43:25] have always dealt with uh by battling in
[43:28] the mind because satan always wants
[43:29] control of the mind
[43:32] if he he can't get control of your heart
[43:34] he's still got to get your mind because
[43:36] when he he he keeps putting in thoughts
[43:39] and keeps putting the thoughts he'll
[43:41] cause you to
[43:42] to backside and to slip up and and
[43:45] and and what we do sometimes with those
[43:47] with those thoughts we think
[43:49] that
[43:50] it's our thoughts satan always says it
[43:52] in such a way
[43:54] that it sounds like it's
[43:57] your thoughts oh
[43:59] and then it's always me
[44:01] i don't know if it's just me or anyone
[44:03] else but uh you know when you pray
[44:05] you're like oh god forgive me for those
[44:07] thoughts i shouldn't have thought those
[44:08] things that's the devil
[44:11] and it
[44:12] and and one thing that i
[44:14] i got here is
[44:17] the mind
[44:19] is not capable
[44:21] of thinking
[44:23] any evil thoughts
[44:25] except that which has been inspired by
[44:28] the devil
[44:30] it's it's exactly right we think well i
[44:32] thought this stopped because
[44:34] um that's that the other error because
[44:37] my heart's wrong and
[44:39] that's it's because the devil don't take
[44:41] ownership for for
[44:43] thoughts and it's simply voices in your
[44:46] head that satan and
[44:48] plants in in your mind to make you think
[44:51] that that it was it was your thoughts
[44:55] and i i spoke to
[44:57] [Music]
[44:58] i i spoke to
[45:00] someone
[45:01] a few months back someone told me that
[45:04] she kept having evil and inappropriate
[45:06] thoughts you use this was her really
[45:09] opening up to me she never really opened
[45:11] up to
[45:12] anyone else
[45:13] um
[45:15] but but she was like really opening up
[45:17] about things because she trusted in me i
[45:20] guess
[45:21] and
[45:22] and also we were having like deep
[45:23] conversations and stuff because i like
[45:25] having deep conversations rather than
[45:28] just
[45:29] going on on whatever the topic is about
[45:31] the weather whatever
[45:33] i i like having deep thoughts and deep
[45:35] conversations
[45:40] um and
[45:42] i asked her if she if she
[45:45] um
[45:46] yeah she said i it would be things that
[45:48] that she would never wish on anyone i
[45:51] asked her if she feeds on anything that
[45:53] would contribute to those thoughts
[45:57] and and
[45:59] such as tv being around the wrong crowd
[46:03] and
[46:04] she said in the end and no no she
[46:06] doesn't
[46:08] excuse me
[46:12] or everything around the wrong crotch
[46:14] she said no
[46:15] so so i said
[46:16] that that is the devil that
[46:19] that does that
[46:20] and for her to resist those voices
[46:22] nothing but the devil
[46:24] it is not like i said it's not possible
[46:27] for the mind to think an evil thought
[46:29] without being inspired by the devil
[46:32] well so stop taking ownership for what
[46:35] the devil puts in your mind satan is
[46:37] crafty and
[46:39] yeah like i said
[46:41] satan's that that crafty makes you think
[46:43] that it's it's your own thoughts it's
[46:45] not
[46:47] see see because if it was back like it
[46:49] wasn't in the garden of eden originally
[46:53] adam and eve never ever thought any bad
[46:56] thoughts until satan came along and he
[46:58] put put those those thoughts in eve's
[47:01] mind
[47:06] and and
[47:09] she she's i believe she's still
[47:11] struggling with with those
[47:13] those those things i'm not not going to
[47:15] name names who it is because
[47:18] because it's a very deep thing it's
[47:20] revealing a lot and i believe that each
[47:22] and every one of us deals with those
[47:24] things
[47:25] and
[47:26] it's it is difficult at times i i
[47:30] thought it was just me
[47:31] and and it's the same with her she
[47:33] thought was just her and no one else
[47:36] deals with those things those thoughts
[47:38] because
[47:39] she said
[47:40] that she would randomly
[47:42] it'd just be like
[47:44] you know
[47:46] even even like cuss words would come
[47:48] into like
[47:50] f for that person
[47:52] she said that would randomly just pop up
[47:54] in her mind and she just never thinks
[47:56] things
[47:57] anything like like that that um
[48:01] it doesn't come from from yourself that
[48:03] that is satan and he he takes whatever
[48:05] you've looked at whatever you overheard
[48:08] whatever you've done and then mix it up
[48:11] with just turn it evil and then and then
[48:14] put it in your mind and then and you're
[48:16] like oh you know that that's
[48:18] but but when we get to the place where
[48:20] we're just
[48:22] when we're just entertaining that
[48:24] thought that that's where where satan
[48:26] and gets us and then that's where sin
[48:28] can be conceived is when you start
[48:30] entertaining those thoughts
[48:33] did
[48:34] in the beginning
[48:37] eve if eve would have just heard what
[48:40] satan said and
[48:43] and just
[48:44] moved on and just was like no
[48:46] god said this let me let me just stick
[48:48] with what god says
[48:49] and that that's the way you should take
[48:50] it every single thought that comes in
[48:52] your mind that says
[48:55] uh and anything bad anything evil you
[48:57] say no that's not what my bible says
[49:00] and and you just stick with that and
[49:02] stick with the word you haven't done
[49:03] nothing wrong it is simply
[49:05] the the devil
[49:07] resists the devil and he will flee
[49:10] i me
[49:11] myself i don't deal with those thoughts
[49:13] as much because every time they come in
[49:14] i'm just like nope that's from the devil
[49:17] i'll just move on and and this is what
[49:19] what the word says just go go with the
[49:22] the bible every single time
[49:26] the the the devil wants
[49:29] the wait let's see um
[49:35] everyone well
[49:37] let me see i don't know
[49:44] and the those are those things are
[49:46] simply
[49:47] in the uh
[49:49] voices that the devil puts in your mind
[49:51] and you think well
[49:53] it
[49:54] it this he also says things that
[49:57] seem like well that that that might be
[50:00] right that might be god speaking to me
[50:02] satan does that because he can he he can
[50:05] get so close to the real thing
[50:08] that that
[50:10] that he that's just that much off
[50:13] just that much off one word that's all
[50:15] has to be off of the bible and and he
[50:18] causes you to slide and causes you to to
[50:20] just go off by one word and that that's
[50:23] where he gets you
[50:33] signs are
[50:35] this is uh another message by brother
[50:37] branham science from god
[50:39] the sign that follows or the voice that
[50:41] follows the sign must be the voice of
[50:44] god speaking from the word for that age
[50:48] do you understand it
[50:51] god gives signs but what does he do it
[50:56] for always give signs he told them that
[50:58] that's what what they'd look for
[51:01] in him in the signs god gives signs to
[51:04] attract the attention of his people not
[51:07] now let's
[51:09] study this thoroughly see signs are
[51:11] given to attract the attention of the
[51:13] people because when
[51:15] when when a godsend sign is given god is
[51:18] ready to speak god is ready to speak
[51:20] what when the sign is given it comes
[51:23] from heaven is from god god is ready to
[51:26] speak he is trying to attract the
[51:28] people's attention see
[51:30] see what what this is saying is that
[51:35] that when
[51:37] the god gives signs it's
[51:40] this is uh different from what i was
[51:43] going on the first
[51:44] but but there there's
[51:46] we can set aside two
[51:49] two voices there's the voice of satan
[51:51] it's either the voice of satan or your
[51:53] own mind or god speaking to you
[51:56] god can speak to you through your mind i
[51:59] know this by
[52:00] experiencing also by others experiences
[52:04] see
[52:06] but it's always backed by the word it's
[52:09] always
[52:12] it's always there's always a voice
[52:15] behind it and and that voice is
[52:19] the behind and if god gives you a sign
[52:21] there's always a voice behind it and
[52:23] that that voice is scriptural see it
[52:26] goes on to say now moses being a
[52:29] scientist which he he was taught in all
[52:31] the wisdom of egyptians and they were
[52:33] greater scientists than than we have
[52:36] today so and being a scientist
[52:39] looked he
[52:40] looked like he he had said
[52:42] now i'll go see what kind of uh
[52:46] chemical is sprayed on those leaves and
[52:48] a tree that doesn't burn see if he had
[52:51] an approach in it if he if he'd have
[52:54] approached it in a scientific way
[52:56] it would have never talked to him
[53:01] you see a lot of this today a bunch of
[53:03] people get their big giant book of
[53:05] theology out like a big book this big
[53:08] and then they're like all right let's
[53:09] hear it it's time to hear the air the
[53:11] voice of god and they
[53:12] they open up their big
[53:15] bucket theology do's and don'ts uh now
[53:19] now let's hope
[53:20] hope that that god speaks to this let's
[53:23] intellectually figure out god and then
[53:26] that that's not the way god works and
[53:28] god doesn't speak through
[53:30] through people's dogmas and
[53:33] in
[53:34] theology and all that stuff he speaks
[53:36] through his word and over
[53:38] and um
[53:41] billy graham speed speaks it and said it
[53:44] like this
[53:48] he's he said
[53:50] that
[53:51] let's see where it is here
[53:54] okay here it is now here's how to read
[53:57] the bible read it reverently it's an
[53:59] interview with almighty god read it with
[54:01] expectancy
[54:03] come to the bible expecting god to speak
[54:05] to you and read it till he does speak to
[54:08] you now maybe you'll only read one verse
[54:10] meditate on that verse maybe you'll
[54:13] you'll read a whole chapter meditate on
[54:15] that chapter come with expectancy
[54:19] that every time you open the scriptures
[54:21] god has a message for you and then read
[54:24] it with dependence the the holy spirit
[54:27] inspires the writing of this book and
[54:29] the holy spirit can interpret the book
[54:32] to you and i have
[54:34] well uh what he he got here is it
[54:38] he he this is his teaching on on
[54:43] what the baptists believe and stuff
[54:45] because he's baptist holy spirit
[54:47] he this holy spirit can interpret
[54:50] it to you god reveals this word through
[54:53] the prophets and it's by revelation
[54:56] but in this the holy spirit inspires the
[54:58] writing of the book and the holy spirit
[55:00] can interpret this to you
[55:04] in a way a god
[55:07] i can reveal
[55:08] you things reveal this book to you
[55:12] not interpret
[55:14] and i have come to many points in the
[55:17] bible that i did not understand and i
[55:20] would would get on my knees and i say
[55:22] show it to me and i found the meaning of
[55:23] the passage on my knees by the holy
[55:25] spirit
[55:29] and
[55:30] and and that
[55:32] that is how it is if you go if you go to
[55:33] the bible and you say god speak to me
[55:35] and you open up your the bible whatever
[55:37] you read and you you come in with
[55:39] expectancy to to hear god speak to you
[55:48] excuse me
[55:51] you you won't you won't have
[55:55] if you're sincere and you're ever happy
[56:09] i i heard this and this was um
[56:12] this was something i don't know it's
[56:14] like crazy this is a video i i watched
[56:18] of a preacher

[56:21] well not all of this is i wrote a lot of
[56:23] this i changed some of it
[56:25] in my own wording that
[56:28] false voices we listen to sometimes in
[56:31] other words
[56:35] prophets and i believe that
[56:38] so so i

[58:36] oh you're not good enough everybody
[58:38] hates you everybody different things
[58:40] lies it's always like that these things
[58:43] that going on on in our mind
[58:47] satan putting things in our mind and
[58:49] different and things like that it's
[58:51] always our self always trying to
[58:54] it's satan trying to push us down and
[58:56] say you're not good enough you you'll
[58:58] never
[58:59] you'll never make it
[59:01] you'll
[59:03] different things like that
[59:05] telling me that that every uh
[59:08] even me
[59:10] it's it's like
[59:11] i i
[59:12] it's always satan telling me that
[59:14] you did you did horrible on that sermon
[59:16] and
[59:17] that's last night it's like um
[59:19] yeah i guess you're right
[59:22] and and i'm i'm guilty of that
[59:24] and and it's like
[59:28] i have to to get myself together and say
[59:33] even if it
[59:35] esteemed it wasn't very good
[59:40] god god may have made it that way
[59:42] exactly
[59:44] to where i think us it's not it's
[59:47] you know that god didn't come down and
[59:50] anointed
[59:51] as i was writing down what i was to
[59:53] preach that something i read from my
[59:56] notes was
[59:58] meant for someone
[1:00:00] and help someone and and and to me i
[1:00:04] don't
[1:00:04] care if i go up here and i say
[1:00:07] different things and i'm all
[1:00:09] and i'm going in
[1:00:13] all i i want to do
[1:00:15] is that go and for
[1:00:17] for god to touch someone's heart through
[1:00:20] my ministry
[1:00:22] if i can and help one person
[1:00:25] that then i i've
[1:00:27] i it's better than me just sitting back
[1:00:30] and saying it's too hard
[1:00:33] and do
[1:00:34] it in life
[1:00:36] if you'll always fail
[1:00:39] you'll always
[1:00:40] you always fail here and there and you
[1:00:42] all you isn't it'll never be
[1:00:45] perfect
[1:00:46] we we are humans we we make mistakes and
[1:00:51] and we we don't always perform as good
[1:00:53] as we want to
[1:00:55] but
[1:00:56] if if god can do something through it
[1:00:59] through through this
[1:01:01] then then
[1:01:03] it's been worth it
[1:01:07] regardless of what it is i i'd rather
[1:01:09] get up here i'd rather i'd rather i'd
[1:01:13] rather
[1:01:14] do what i feel god is leading me to do
[1:01:16] than sit back and say i'm too scared
[1:01:19] because i might mess up
[1:01:21] and i get like that and and
[1:01:25] just like michael john got up here to
[1:01:29] to to speak to give his testimony
[1:01:31] i knew he'd probably
[1:01:34] get really nervous and mess and maybe
[1:01:38] mess up and not in fumble's words and
[1:01:40] all that
[1:01:41] but but he still got up here to give his
[1:01:44] testimony
[1:01:46] i kind of forced him to but
[1:01:51] but he still got up here and he had that
[1:01:53] choice whether he wanted to get up here
[1:01:54] or not
[1:01:57] and and he did
[1:02:00] and
[1:02:01] and and if if it and
[1:02:04] i i'd like it if
[1:02:06] it's done
[1:02:07] anything
[1:02:08] god can use it in a powerful way
[1:02:12] because because not only is
[1:02:15] is um even if it didn't help anyone in
[1:02:17] this building this
[1:02:19] service is online so different people
[1:02:21] watch it online
[1:02:23] and it could help someone streaming it
[1:02:25] you know
[1:02:27] and
[1:02:30] it's it is it is hard something time
[1:02:36] one thing i always say
[1:02:40] like is
[1:02:45] sometimes we don't have enough
[1:02:46] discipline and that we're disciplined
[1:02:49] that word discipline is was derived from
[1:02:52] the same word as disciples
[1:02:54] driven
[1:02:55] you can't be a christian without any
[1:02:57] discipline
[1:02:58] let's just get get that straight
[1:03:00] and
[1:03:01] you you can't really be a christian
[1:03:03] without any discipline because it takes
[1:03:05] discipline to end to get up sure it's
[1:03:08] it's
[1:03:09] god that's called you into this but god
[1:03:11] gives you discipline and it will helps
[1:03:14] you along he leads you and guides you
[1:03:16] but but still us as as human beings we
[1:03:19] need to have discipline to be able to
[1:03:22] to gap and say i don't feel like reading
[1:03:25] the bible read it anyway that's when
[1:03:27] discipline and kingston when there's no
[1:03:29] longer motivation to do anything that
[1:03:31] you're supposed to do which we
[1:03:33] we can't always go by motivation people
[1:03:36] motivation is overrated not everyone and
[1:03:38] has motivation all the time you ain't
[1:03:40] making i don't feel like doing the sound
[1:03:43] going to church on wednesday i don't
[1:03:44] feel like
[1:03:47] when you feel
[1:03:49] this is what's right
[1:03:53] and and you feel on the inside this is
[1:03:55] what's right
[1:03:56] i have to do it it's like that that's
[1:03:59] when discipline kicks into discipline as
[1:04:02] in
[1:04:03] and um
[1:04:05] disciple disciples have discipline
[1:04:08] because discipline is a part of
[1:04:09] discipleship picking up your cross
[1:04:13] and
[1:04:14] and
[1:04:16] and just keep going on nice
[1:04:18] and they keep going and carrying that
[1:04:21] cross that that's when discipline kicks
[1:04:23] in when you do
[1:04:31] exactly every every day
[1:04:50] everyone
[1:04:51] would like to do nothing he wants you to
[1:04:54] be without doing
[1:04:56] the work is crazy
[1:04:58] there's a good quote i heard yeah
[1:05:01] that i heard the other day
[1:05:03] everybody wants to be
[1:05:06] a
[1:05:07] let me just change the the word it says
[1:05:08] beast right everyone wants to be a beast
[1:05:11] everybody wants to be an eagle till it's
[1:05:13] time to do what eagles do
[1:05:17] is that
[1:05:18] right
[1:05:19] everybody wants to be a christian but
[1:05:21] ain't nobody want to do what christians
[1:05:23] are supposed to do what christians do
[1:05:26] and and that's what that's where they
[1:05:28] like oh
[1:05:29] you know this is kind of hard
[1:05:32] and and it's just not in them to do that
[1:05:34] because because
[1:05:36] they're not
[1:05:40] some
[1:05:42] uh
[1:05:43] it's just
[1:05:45] simply because
[1:05:47] god didn't put it on the inside some
[1:05:49] people are like that
[1:05:51] they don't have what it takes to do that
[1:05:53] to keep going but
[1:05:57] but but those that were were born and
[1:06:00] for more you get when i was young i felt
[1:06:07] i was called to something
[1:06:12] they're calling i have something bigger
[1:06:14] than this and
[1:06:16] and i i feel like i'm being beat down to
[1:06:19] the ground why is things so hard
[1:06:22] it's it's because
[1:06:25] it's because your calling is great
[1:06:27] because god called you to something
[1:06:28] greater than everybody else not everyone
[1:06:34] and goes through friendships
[1:06:37] that that
[1:06:39] we have to go through
[1:06:41] but but
[1:06:43] what when it is great so so is the
[1:06:46] character building and that that's a
[1:06:48] that's the way that i also heard that
[1:06:51] you should have this kind of
[1:06:54] set
[1:06:55] that you should think instead of me
[1:06:59] having this
[1:07:00] um
[1:07:02] i'm so down
[1:07:04] things are going bad and it's a bad day
[1:07:07] i'm just having a bad day instead have
[1:07:10] this thing where you're saying
[1:07:12] i'm having a character building day
[1:07:16] i thought man that's really good that
[1:07:18] that's really real because because in in
[1:07:20] the bad times god's working on your
[1:07:23] testimony
[1:07:25] and
[1:07:27] that that's how it is that like you have
[1:07:29] uh right right now um uh
[1:07:33] she she messaged me and she said i'm i'm
[1:07:35] dealing with
[1:07:36] a lot of
[1:07:38] uh well in a way she said like
[1:07:41] things in my thoughts is that my mind is
[1:07:43] attacking me
[1:07:45] in other words she's having spiritual
[1:07:47] warfare
[1:07:49] and and she she said to pray for she
[1:07:51] texted me this on on the way
[1:07:54] here
[1:07:55] well well when i was about to leave for
[1:07:57] here
[1:07:58] and i i just was thinking
[1:08:02] well i told her to listen to the sermon
[1:08:04] because
[1:08:05] because i had written down a lot of
[1:08:07] stuff that that
[1:08:08] she she's been going through i already
[1:08:10] wrote all this down
[1:08:12] you are not your thoughts you're the one
[1:08:14] listening to and all this what was
[1:08:17] written down before she texted me this
[1:08:20] so
[1:08:21] it just makes me think
[1:08:26] god is good i mean
[1:08:28] it's
[1:08:30] it feels like
[1:08:31] it felt more that god was leading me me
[1:08:33] to write down all this because because
[1:08:36] there's people
[1:08:37] real people going through this right now
[1:08:41] where they they feel like they're
[1:08:42] getting
[1:08:43] so much
[1:08:44] things going up in in their mind where
[1:08:47] they can't hardly control and it's just
[1:08:49] like
[1:08:50] they want it to stop and they don't know
[1:08:52] how to make it stop
[1:08:54] and it's it's hard it's difficult i know
[1:08:57] i've been through it i
[1:08:59] remember when i was
[1:09:00] i was just listening to depressing and
[1:09:03] music and and i was just in i was
[1:09:06] depressed in a place where i was
[1:09:08] depressed and i had all these thoughts
[1:09:09] going in my mind and it was like the the
[1:09:12] worst thing ever because it was always
[1:09:14] like
[1:09:15] singing in my mind i was in a really bad
[1:09:18] place i'm not i'm not uh going to say
[1:09:20] i'm i was an angel my whole life
[1:09:23] i've i've been went through some really
[1:09:25] bad stuff
[1:09:26] and
[1:09:28] and well and mainly in my mind it was
[1:09:30] always satan if satan can't get you
[1:09:33] in a trap in in the physical realm he'll
[1:09:36] get you in the spiritual realm in your
[1:09:38] mind where they'll put you in a he'll
[1:09:40] lock you in this
[1:09:42] this cage this
[1:09:44] this prison in your mind and that and i
[1:09:48] was in that prison before i remember
[1:09:50] singing in my mind
[1:09:53] in
[1:09:54] in that
[1:09:56] i hate myself that was literally a song
[1:09:59] that i listened to
[1:10:01] before that
[1:10:03] i hate myself in the end that's how i
[1:10:04] what always was whenever i would have
[1:10:06] awful thoughts i tried
[1:10:09] battling it by saying
[1:10:11] that that i hate myself and i hate these
[1:10:13] thoughts and i hate everything and and
[1:10:16] that's how bad you can get i think p
[1:10:19] people have gotten even worse than that
[1:10:20] to where
[1:10:21] to where they put a gun to the head i'm
[1:10:23] tired of these thoughts and it pulled
[1:10:25] the trigger that's
[1:10:27] it can drive people to the grave
[1:10:31] and with how much satan can attack one's
[1:10:35] mind because
[1:10:37] satan knows
[1:10:40] your potential
[1:10:42] and and satan will oh oh bring it he'll
[1:10:45] attack your mind he'll grab a hold of
[1:10:46] him and you'll say yeah you're mine and
[1:10:50] uh unless
[1:10:51] and unless yes we reach out to unto
[1:10:54] jesus and say
[1:10:56] god i don't want these thoughts anymore
[1:10:57] god i don't i want these things you i
[1:11:00] will always have
[1:11:03] you will always have the the battles in
[1:11:05] mind but but when it captures you and
[1:11:08] you say jesus set me free
[1:11:11] can set you free from every bit of those
[1:11:14] those thoughts every bit of those those
[1:11:17] things sure you will have um
[1:11:21] i remember even singing
[1:11:24] well actually i was rapping and i said
[1:11:27] there's a battle going on my mind
[1:11:31] and and there's a reason for that
[1:11:33] a reason for that satan and
[1:11:36] satan is trying to
[1:11:41] your mind to where you think
[1:11:43] everything is going to stay the same
[1:11:46] every nothing's going to change you're
[1:11:48] always going to be this person that that
[1:11:51] you know you are you're you're
[1:11:53] you're nothing but
[1:11:55] a
[1:11:57] you're nothing but and some um idiot
[1:12:00] that that thinks that they can escape
[1:12:03] this you think you can escape this
[1:12:05] that that's that's the thoughts that
[1:12:08] that satan tries to
[1:12:10] put in in your mind you can't escape
[1:12:13] you'll you won't have freedom you won't
[1:12:15] get your healing you won't
[1:12:17] be set free from from these things
[1:12:20] and satan does that he tells you these
[1:12:22] things and it's and it can come to us
[1:12:24] like your own thoughts
[1:12:26] why even try you're not you're not even
[1:12:29] going to get anywhere
[1:12:33] but you just got to
[1:12:34] say you just gotta resist the devil and
[1:12:37] say
[1:12:38] i've had enough devil
[1:12:40] get out
[1:12:42] and he will he will leave even
[1:12:46] and and what i told her was
[1:12:50] to really just really read that the
[1:12:54] bible and fill your mind with the word
[1:12:58] and just really
[1:13:00] meditate on those things
[1:13:02] and those thoughts will begin to
[1:13:06] to to change to
[1:13:08] from that to the word because you you're
[1:13:11] meditating you're feeding your mind
[1:13:12] those things just like what i was doing
[1:13:15] i was feeding my mind all this
[1:13:17] this
[1:13:18] depressing music and all this trash and
[1:13:22] and that's what happens
[1:13:23] and your mind and
[1:13:26] changes those things and satan uses that
[1:13:29] and he gets you to he he got me to
[1:13:31] listen to the in the beginning and he
[1:13:34] even
[1:13:35] and brought me in being like oh this is
[1:13:38] christian yeah it's not actually
[1:13:42] he's supposed to be it was nf he's
[1:13:45] supposed to be like a christian and he
[1:13:47] doesn't have any bad words in the music
[1:13:50] and all that don't listen to it because
[1:13:52] he he had nothing
[1:13:54] the all the music was nothing but like
[1:13:57] he would bring up god a bunch of times
[1:14:00] and this that the other
[1:14:01] but he had
[1:14:03] some
[1:14:04] kind of
[1:14:05] well he had ocd and different things and
[1:14:07] he would
[1:14:09] and
[1:14:11] he he was not the best christian and he
[1:14:14] didn't even
[1:14:15] he didn't even
[1:14:17] um
[1:14:20] he wouldn't and do it and really do it
[1:14:22] for the glory of god either he would
[1:14:23] just simply and just
[1:14:25] wrap a bunch of things about his
[1:14:27] thoughts and the battle and his mind and
[1:14:29] everything else like that and i began to
[1:14:30] think well
[1:14:32] that sounds nice
[1:14:34] no it just sounded nice because the beat
[1:14:36] was like oh yeah that sounds really good
[1:14:38] and it was for the flash and oh i can
[1:14:41] relate to that and it's just like this
[1:14:43] thing where i was
[1:14:45] so obsessed with it to
[1:14:47] to where
[1:14:48] it was it became what i would always
[1:14:51] think about all those lyrics and
[1:14:52] everything all the time
[1:14:54] so really if you're battling with any of
[1:14:57] those things
[1:14:58] stop focusing on all the negativity
[1:15:01] start thinking more positively
[1:15:04] if if you start thinking positively
[1:15:07] so so we'll your your life will get
[1:15:09] better and
[1:15:11] and instead of thinking i can't do this
[1:15:13] i can't do that yes you can it's just
[1:15:16] it's just your mind telling you that you
[1:15:18] can't
[1:15:19] musicians if you come
[1:15:21] and it's
[1:15:23] it is like that all
[1:15:25] and you will have to have battles and
[1:15:27] you will always have battles in your
[1:15:29] your mind sometimes and satan will
[1:15:34] will push
[1:15:35] his
[1:15:37] voices in your mind but but then there's
[1:15:39] that still small voice now i got i got
[1:15:42] that part down where we separated all
[1:15:44] all the voices in your mind
[1:15:47] where you're thinking of all the
[1:15:50] all the bad things all the bad side of
[1:15:53] it satan's voice there's satan's voice
[1:15:55] now i got that on the side now let's
[1:15:57] talk about
[1:15:58] god's voice god god speaks takes
[1:16:03] god speaks to us
[1:16:04] through it through his word and and i
[1:16:07] remember
[1:16:08] yeah i'll tell you in this story i
[1:16:10] remember
[1:16:12] when
[1:16:12] i was
[1:16:17] it was it was the worst
[1:16:18] time in my life the worst point in my
[1:16:20] life i remember
[1:16:23] not yeah this is
[1:16:26] it is the worst time
[1:16:29] in my life i was at the lowest of the
[1:16:31] low
[1:16:32] points
[1:16:33] and
[1:16:34] this was a time when
[1:16:37] when when i was
[1:16:40] addicted to
[1:16:43] when i was addicted to pornography
[1:16:48] i
[1:16:50] didn't understand the situation
[1:16:52] that
[1:16:53] i was in i didn't it was the worst thing
[1:16:56] that ever happened to me my parents
[1:16:58] found out
[1:17:00] and
[1:17:01] i was thinking this is so bad this is
[1:17:03] the worst thing ever i was like i was
[1:17:06] denying it i was in denial at first i
[1:17:08] knew i was struggling at that time and i
[1:17:11] was like i don't want to do this anymore
[1:17:12] and then god went and
[1:17:15] and helped me out
[1:17:17] but
[1:17:18] i didn't like it i don't it's not the
[1:17:20] way that i wanted it to go and i hated
[1:17:23] it how it it it was and i was
[1:17:27] really broken down because it's so
[1:17:29] shameful what i what i was doing and
[1:17:33] that i was
[1:17:35] full of shame i was like
[1:17:37] and now that they know
[1:17:40] and it's like
[1:17:41] you never wanted them to know that's the
[1:17:42] worst thing that could ever happen i
[1:17:44] thought and and i was i remember just
[1:17:47] breaking down i went out and outside in
[1:17:50] in a quiet place and i was just really
[1:17:52] crying and i was like
[1:17:54] god why does this have to happen
[1:17:56] i was going to stop
[1:17:59] but
[1:18:00] but that's a that's the thing it was
[1:18:02] always a thing where i was in the circle
[1:18:04] i'm going to stop and then back out
[1:18:06] again and stop and then back out again
[1:18:08] it was always a thing even if it took
[1:18:10] like a week all of a sudden something
[1:18:11] would tap me and get me back into it and
[1:18:13] i hated it and i wanted deliverance at
[1:18:16] the the time
[1:18:17] and
[1:18:18] god really did help me out and it was a
[1:18:20] lot of shame involved it was really bad
[1:18:23] it wasn't the way i wanted it to go but
[1:18:25] but god
[1:18:27] made it so that that would happen
[1:18:29] to help me and
[1:18:31] in the midst of the the tears in the
[1:18:33] midst of the crying
[1:18:36] and and just really
[1:18:38] sobbing and weeping because i i hated
[1:18:41] that i mean you could imagine i was so
[1:18:44] full of shame and guilt and
[1:18:46] all all these
[1:18:49] these thoughts and things
[1:18:51] my mom
[1:18:52] took my phone away i was glad she did
[1:18:54] and i was like okay that's good
[1:18:57] even though
[1:18:58] it was it's because i was addicted to
[1:19:00] into it for one and addicted to all that
[1:19:02] stuff and i'm i was glad deep down that
[1:19:05] she took it
[1:19:06] and because it would stop me from doing
[1:19:09] that and
[1:19:11] but in the midst of all that
[1:19:13] it would
[1:19:14] i heard the voice of god in my my mind
[1:19:17] it wasn't
[1:19:19] the kind of voice i always thought when
[1:19:22] i was younger wouldn't it be nice if god
[1:19:24] just spoke to me lip to ear but god only
[1:19:26] does that with his prophets
[1:19:28] so
[1:19:30] but god spoke to me in my mind and
[1:19:32] and i just knew it was the voice of god
[1:19:34] when i heard it it was that voice that
[1:19:36] said
[1:19:38] things are going to hurt right now but
[1:19:40] things are going to get better
[1:19:43] it i wouldn't have thought of that that
[1:19:45] because i was in the worst moment
[1:19:47] all of a sudden a sense of and and it
[1:19:50] just gave me that sense of peace
[1:19:52] and
[1:19:53] and i was just like
[1:19:56] and then i
[1:19:58] don't know how things are going to get
[1:19:59] better
[1:20:00] from now it's it just seems horrible and
[1:20:03] my
[1:20:04] thinking how my parents must see me and
[1:20:07] thinking how they must think of me and
[1:20:10] thinking of myself as such a horrible
[1:20:13] person
[1:20:14] like
[1:20:16] there's a statistic that ninety percent
[1:20:19] of
[1:20:20] of uh
[1:20:22] boys have struggled with it as some of
[1:20:24] them
[1:20:25] men that have struggled with it at some
[1:20:27] point in life it's horrible it's so the
[1:20:29] worst thing ever
[1:20:31] but
[1:20:32] thank god
[1:20:34] he delivered me from that it was it was
[1:20:36] a it's a demon that that
[1:20:39] get and to get because it's in in our
[1:20:42] self to to
[1:20:44] be like that attractiveness and stuff
[1:20:46] towards various women and all that
[1:20:49] we have it
[1:20:51] satan just perverted something that was
[1:20:53] good something that god meant for good
[1:20:55] that meant
[1:20:56] that god put
[1:20:57] in in us men but satan when perverted it
[1:21:02] and that's that's how how it is and
[1:21:05] it's it's also
[1:21:08] that same voice
[1:21:11] that same voice i hear
[1:21:13] when
[1:21:14] when things do it'll go bad it's just
[1:21:16] that that thing that positive thing
[1:21:19] things are going to be okay you're going
[1:21:20] to make it
[1:21:22] it's always that it's it's not negative
[1:21:25] when you feel like things are going to
[1:21:27] be bad and it's just that that still
[1:21:29] small voice that you hear you're going
[1:21:31] to make it through this
[1:21:34] now
[1:21:35] and we'll be like well i'm not sure that
[1:21:37] if that was god
[1:21:39] but
[1:21:40] if if you don't think in yourself that
[1:21:43] you could have ever thought of that
[1:21:45] probably was god if it was is scriptural
[1:21:47] and it was it was
[1:21:49] and it felt like it was god it probably
[1:21:50] was god
[1:21:52] and that that's
[1:21:53] that's how it is
[1:21:55] man
[1:21:56] let's pray
[1:21:59] stand with me if you will
