[52:53] how about you
[52:54] you ain't seen nothing yet right
[52:57] god is good
[52:58] so saint john 10
[53:01] saint john 10 and we spoke sunday i
[53:04] believe on the door right
[53:06] the doorway amen he is the door he is
[53:08] the way
[53:10] i am the door verse 9. it says by me if
[53:12] any man enter in he shall be saved and
[53:14] shall go in and out
[53:16] and find
[53:18] pasture i like that
[53:19] the key thief cometh not but for to
[53:21] steal and to kill and to destroy
[53:24] i am calm that you might have life and
[53:26] that you might have it more abundantly
[53:29] can somebody say amen
[53:31] boy that's right
[53:33] i am the good shepherd
[53:35] the good shepherd giveth his life for
[53:38] the sheep but he that isn't harling and
[53:40] not not the shepherd
[53:42] who's owned a sheep or not seeth the
[53:45] wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and
[53:47] fleeteth and watch the wolf catches them
[53:50] and scattereth the sheep
[53:51] the hiring fleet because he is in
[53:53] hireling and careth not for the sheep i
[53:55] am the good shepherd
[53:58] amen
[53:59] i am the good shepherd and know my sheep
[54:03] and am known of mine
[54:06] amen
[54:07] as the father knoweth me even so no i
[54:09] the father and i lay down my life for
[54:11] the sheep
[54:12] and other sheep have i which are not of
[54:14] this fold them also i must bring and
[54:17] they shall hear
[54:19] my
[54:20] voice
[54:21] and they shall be one fold and one
[54:23] shepherd amen may god add his blessings
[54:26] to the reading of the words you can be
[54:27] seated tonight
[54:29] so this evening for a little while we
[54:30] want to talk about the good shepherd
[54:32] amen
[54:33] but you know one thing i was thinking
[54:35] about back there
[54:37] and that is that it looked like this
[54:39] shepherd they called himself the good
[54:41] shepherd
[54:42] you know
[54:44] how that how many knows that at the end
[54:46] of jesus's life
[54:49] uh the pharisees and perhaps the world
[54:51] and everything about
[54:54] perhaps the atmosphere of the end of
[54:57] jesus ministry seemed
[55:00] like a complete failure
[55:03] a complete failure and that's a lot for
[55:06] a preacher to say up here
[55:08] because here he had
[55:10] thousands following him at one time
[55:12] right
[55:13] he had such big crowds until he had to
[55:15] you know say things that within the
[55:18] crowd down
[55:19] caused people to go away
[55:21] he was very popular there for a while
[55:23] you know as long as he's healing the
[55:24] sick and so forth but there at the end
[55:26] we know that he was taken captive
[55:28] something that wasn't really expected by
[55:31] the disciples
[55:33] things did not turn out the way the
[55:34] disciples expected and when jesus had
[55:37] told him that i'm going to
[55:39] be killed and so forth and everything
[55:40] that's going to happen
[55:42] peter didn't like it too well he didn't
[55:44] like the course the channel and
[55:46] direction that it was going to go for
[55:47] jesus
[55:48] and it seemed like his sheep i mean
[55:50] those had all scattered
[55:53] right his sheep had all scattered even
[55:55] his own
[55:56] disciples you know had left
[55:59] and you know jesus at one place over
[56:01] here in verse
[56:04] let me see
[56:08] verse 28 he says i will
[56:10] give unto them eternal life and they
[56:12] shall never perish neither shall any man
[56:15] pluck them out of my hand and my father
[56:17] which is gave them me is greater than
[56:19] all and no man shall be able to pluck
[56:20] them out of my father's hand so it
[56:22] sounded like you know you're saying
[56:23] there is nobody going to plug my sheep
[56:25] out of my hand but
[56:27] what ended up as far as the natural
[56:30] looking like a complete disaster was not
[56:32] a disaster at all
[56:33] how many knows that
[56:35] everybody had forsaken and that's one of
[56:37] the things that hurt i believe jesus in
[56:39] his heart so much is that he had to walk
[56:41] alone he had to go to that cross alone
[56:44] everybody denied him and walked away
[56:46] from him and yeah he had zero
[56:48] almost zero people that really stood
[56:50] behind him maybe mary she did there she
[56:52] took up for him going to the cross but
[56:54] very few
[56:56] but he kept talking about laying down
[56:58] his life for the sheep because guess
[57:00] what he was never going to save the
[57:02] sheep there was only one way to save the
[57:04] sheep
[57:05] and that was the lays down lies down for
[57:07] the sheep isn't that right
[57:08] and of course we know that
[57:10] none of these disciples he says and i
[57:12] have he's have one place he says that he
[57:14] has lost none of them
[57:16] but one
[57:17] judas talking about jesus judas that the
[57:20] scriptures might be fulfilled he knew
[57:22] that judas was going to leave him all
[57:23] along and that right and betray him and
[57:25] so forth but other than that he didn't
[57:27] lose the one of his sheep
[57:29] shortly scattered for a little while but
[57:31] whenever god gets you in his hand he's
[57:33] not going to let you go
[57:35] i'm glad that but we could take the
[57:37] entire service tonight and talk about
[57:39] eternal security
[57:41] amen and a real genuine believer that
[57:44] saved and sanctified i mean i'm talking
[57:46] about real genuine born again amen they
[57:49] are sealed until the day of their
[57:51] redemption
[57:52] amen when god gets a hold of you
[57:55] there is nobody and nothing going to
[57:58] pluck
[57:58] oh my can you imagine i can't imagine
[58:01] somebody going up to god trying to open
[58:03] his hand and say give me your sheep
[58:06] huh i'm gonna take this up i'm gonna
[58:08] pluck this out of your hand i'm gonna
[58:09] take this from you ain't nobody gonna do
[58:11] that
[58:12] and jesus made that clear
[58:15] huh that when you come to god
[58:18] if you are of god and you know that's
[58:20] that's a big thing how many knows it's a
[58:21] big thing of whether or not you're a
[58:23] sheep
[58:26] it's really big
[58:28] how big is it brother before we go into
[58:30] a couple of these thoughts because i
[58:31] want to i want to speak on a couple of
[58:33] couple of these things
[58:35] and we also want to talk about how that
[58:37] god has
[58:38] shepherds
[58:40] amen
[58:41] and that he shepherds through people
[58:43] i mean knows that god shepherds through
[58:46] people
[58:47] amen but let's go i want to talk about
[58:50] just for a few minutes here at the
[58:51] opening
[58:52] about the importance of what it is about
[58:55] sheep
[58:56] shepherds
[58:58] and goats
[58:59] all right
[59:00] in matthew 25
[59:02] when jesus begins to talk about the very
[59:05] judgment when the judgment day comes all
[59:08] right
[59:09] this is in chapter 25 of matthew
[59:12] and verse 31 when the son of man shall
[59:15] come in his glory and all the holy
[59:19] angels with him
[59:21] that shall see he set upon the throne of
[59:24] his glory
[59:27] oh my let's go there for a minute shall
[59:29] we
[59:30] can you imagine what it's going to be
[59:32] like when he sits upon the throne of his
[59:35] glory
[59:37] amen
[59:38] and before him shall be gathered
[59:43] huh
[59:44] all of our politicians democrats
[59:46] republicans the whole world
[59:49] huh
[59:51] the russian president all of these great
[59:54] people all nations it says everybody
[59:57] is going to come before him
[1:00:01] all nations
[1:00:02] and what is he going to do
[1:00:04] when this happens and he shall separate
[1:00:08] them one from another
[1:00:10] as a shepherd divideth his sheep
[1:00:14] from the goats
[1:00:16] huh
[1:00:18] now i don't know much about shepherding
[1:00:20] other than being a pastor here in people
[1:00:21] but now when it comes to actual sheep
[1:00:23] and goats apparently you don't keep the
[1:00:25] two together
[1:00:27] right
[1:00:29] i guess we could use an example
[1:00:31] goats don't go too well with sheep
[1:00:34] why
[1:00:36] because they butt too much
[1:00:40] they're always budding you see you see
[1:00:42] because the pharisee ain't fair you see
[1:00:45] right
[1:00:46] they're always betting but budding and
[1:00:48] they butted heads with jesus
[1:00:51] didn't the pharisees constantly talk to
[1:00:53] him and accuse him of this and the
[1:00:56] disciples don't wash their head but they
[1:00:58] don't wash their hands but they eat corn
[1:01:01] in them on sunday
[1:01:03] and then they always catch him in his
[1:01:05] words and ask him if i know but what
[1:01:07] about this and the woman in the very act
[1:01:09] but what about this but but but
[1:01:12] but
[1:01:13] goats are really good at buddies
[1:01:18] and you know what that tells me what
[1:01:20] that tells me
[1:01:21] is that a goat doesn't need a shepherd
[1:01:25] and he always has his own ideas in his
[1:01:27] own thoughts that he wants to
[1:01:29] implement
[1:01:31] huh
[1:01:33] goats want to implement their own ideas
[1:01:38] huh
[1:01:41] that's right
[1:01:42] that's why they always butt but what
[1:01:44] about this and but what a quick forget
[1:01:46] don't don't don't don't go there
[1:01:50] right don't even don't even start
[1:01:54] because god don't need to implement your
[1:01:55] ideas
[1:01:56] he has a certain way when you find
[1:01:58] somebody that
[1:01:59] always questioning things and never
[1:02:01] happy with anything and hey what about
[1:02:03] this and what about that you know watch
[1:02:05] out
[1:02:06] amen
[1:02:08] we've got the plan i mean as we got the
[1:02:10] plan we got the word of god we got the
[1:02:12] message of the hour we know what to go
[1:02:13] by there's no question about it
[1:02:17] okay
[1:02:18] but now the point i want to make here
[1:02:20] is and he shall separate them notice how
[1:02:23] he talks about he calls them sheep and
[1:02:25] goats so all the nations and everybody
[1:02:27] he classes everybody as either a sheep
[1:02:31] or a goat
[1:02:34] it's quite something man you're either a
[1:02:36] sheep
[1:02:37] or you're a goat
[1:02:39] and a sh and a goat can amen
[1:02:42] praise the lord he can shout he can
[1:02:44] enjoy the blessings of god he can bleach
[1:02:47] just like a sheep
[1:02:49] huh
[1:02:50] sound just like a sheep
[1:02:53] how do you tell
[1:02:54] i go to work with him once
[1:02:57] huh watch his nature
[1:03:00] watch his natures see how he acts all
[1:03:03] the time see what's way down in there
[1:03:06] huh
[1:03:09] and let me show you can i tell you how
[1:03:11] else to tell a sheep from a goat
[1:03:13] let's read a little further you'll see
[1:03:17] now i want to kind of quiz you tonight a
[1:03:18] little bit
[1:03:20] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:03:22] hand
[1:03:22] remember sheep are always on the right
[1:03:25] side
[1:03:26] and the goats are always on the left
[1:03:29] that's right
[1:03:31] notice and then shall the king say unto
[1:03:33] them that is on the right come he
[1:03:35] blessed of my father inherit the kingdom
[1:03:37] i was prepared for you from the
[1:03:39] foundation of the world for i was a
[1:03:41] hunger then you gave me meat i was
[1:03:43] thirsty and he gave me drink i was a
[1:03:44] stranger you took me in naked and he
[1:03:46] closed me and i was sick and he visited
[1:03:48] me and i was in prison and you came unto
[1:03:50] me and the righteous answer says when
[1:03:52] did we ever see you hungry thirsty just
[1:03:54] out of the other and then the same way
[1:03:56] to the uh he said the same thing to the
[1:03:58] goats depart you from into everlasting
[1:04:01] uh fire because i was hungry i was
[1:04:03] thirsty i was naked i would never visit
[1:04:06] so now the question tonight is
[1:04:09] what is it
[1:04:10] that sheep always
[1:04:13] do
[1:04:14] okay the thing that sheep always do
[1:04:17] and the condition
[1:04:20] of the people that they did it to that's
[1:04:22] the big quiz question what was the
[1:04:24] condition
[1:04:25] of the people that they did it to
[1:04:28] and the answer is these people were
[1:04:30] people
[1:04:31] that were down
[1:04:35] huh they were hungry
[1:04:36] they didn't have clothes they were
[1:04:38] strange no place to sleep
[1:04:42] they were in prison
[1:04:43] they they needed clothes they were
[1:04:45] always knee was always a need it was
[1:04:47] always they were down
[1:04:49] so if you want to know if somebody
[1:04:50] should not get down one time really good
[1:04:53] and see what somebody does to you when
[1:04:55] you're down
[1:04:57] and that tells you who they are
[1:05:01] huh
[1:05:02] it tells you who you are
[1:05:04] do you help people when they're in
[1:05:06] need or don't you
[1:05:09] is that good
[1:05:11] that's the truth ain't it
[1:05:12] we're all in need
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:16] and
[1:05:17] on that side how many notes it made a
[1:05:20] big difference god sees those things how
[1:05:23] many knows god sees those things just
[1:05:24] like the good samaritan now how many
[1:05:26] knows that jesus didn't come for the
[1:05:27] samaritans
[1:05:28] jesus
[1:05:29] i came not but for the
[1:05:32] the lost sheep of the house of israel
[1:05:34] but yet he gave us the example of a man
[1:05:36] that was bruised and beat and robbed and
[1:05:38] everything else and every maybe all the
[1:05:40] jews
[1:05:42] the priests
[1:05:43] all them guys they just went on by i
[1:05:46] don't want to deal with that guy
[1:05:48] huh
[1:05:49] but the samaritan he picked him up
[1:05:51] wounded him up put him put they took him
[1:05:53] to the doctor and that right put him up
[1:05:56] and he's the one that got the credit
[1:05:58] right he's the one that will be
[1:06:00] remembered
[1:06:02] so we look at the importance
[1:06:07] of sheep
[1:06:09] and goats
[1:06:10] how many knows that are sheep
[1:06:12] we as sheep
[1:06:14] are
[1:06:16] absolutely
[1:06:17] we have to have a shepherd we have to
[1:06:20] have
[1:06:21] a leader
[1:06:23] i have got to have
[1:06:25] a leader
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:29] and while it's true that your pastor is
[1:06:30] your leader but the real leader is the
[1:06:33] holy ghost
[1:06:35] how many knows
[1:06:37] let me say something else i'm going to
[1:06:39] say this because i thought about it
[1:06:40] today
[1:06:41] because if your leader if your shepherd
[1:06:44] isn't following the great shepherd
[1:06:46] what's going to happen
[1:06:49] you're going to fall in the ditch right
[1:06:51] it's not going to turn all right
[1:06:53] if your shepherd
[1:06:55] is not following the great chapter
[1:06:58] it's all going to come not
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:01] you're going to be disappointed so it's
[1:07:03] important
[1:07:04] that a pastor is in the will of god
[1:07:08] that he is following the great shepherd
[1:07:10] because if he's not
[1:07:11] you're in trouble
[1:07:13] but i'm so thankful aren't you glad for
[1:07:15] that now there's so many different
[1:07:17] things here
[1:07:18] now i want to
[1:07:20] let me just go to one of them right off
[1:07:22] the go get
[1:07:24] in verse 27
[1:07:26] great shepherd says this my sheep hear
[1:07:28] my voice
[1:07:30] and i know them and they follow
[1:07:33] me
[1:07:34] over in verse chapter 10 if you have
[1:07:36] your bible say i want to go with me
[1:07:38] chapter 10 verse
[1:07:40] 2.
[1:07:42] but he that entereth in by the door is
[1:07:44] the shepherd of the sheep
[1:07:46] to him the porter openeth and the sheep
[1:07:48] hear his voice okay
[1:07:51] both times here jesus is talking about
[1:07:53] how that the sheep hear
[1:07:55] his voice
[1:07:58] and he calleth his own sheep by name and
[1:08:01] he leadeth them out
[1:08:04] again verse 4 has to do with hearing his
[1:08:07] voice and when he put his forth his own
[1:08:09] sheep he goeth before them and the sheep
[1:08:12] follow him for they know
[1:08:16] his
[1:08:18] voice
[1:08:20] boy i'm here to tell you right
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:23] as now
[1:08:23] shepherd that it is 100 imperative that
[1:08:27] you know the voice of god
[1:08:30] because how many knows there are a lot
[1:08:32] of voices in this world let me say
[1:08:34] something else tonight if you write this
[1:08:36] down in your little book
[1:08:38] that the voices that you listen to
[1:08:41] creates your whole entire world
[1:08:50] that's right it creates your whole
[1:08:53] entire world
[1:08:55] whether it's listening to your pastor
[1:08:56] whether it's listening to other people
[1:08:58] or whether it's listening to the voice
[1:09:00] in your head
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:03] huh
[1:09:05] folks a lot of times we have a lot of
[1:09:06] voices come in our head we have a lot of
[1:09:08] thoughts coming in our head
[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:14] and let me say that it's imperative that
[1:09:16] you know which one is the i have young
[1:09:18] people i have different people people
[1:09:20] listening out here it's important that
[1:09:22] you know what the voice of god is
[1:09:24] because if you don't
[1:09:27] you're not fitting in with these
[1:09:28] scriptures
[1:09:30] but this scripture says my sheep
[1:09:32] they know my voice
[1:09:36] and i think most of us can admit
[1:09:39] most of us can admit
[1:09:41] that when we listen to tapes when we
[1:09:42] listen to brother branham
[1:09:44] it was something about that voice but in
[1:09:46] the days of the voice of the summoned
[1:09:48] angel when he shall begin to sound right
[1:09:52] somebody's going to hear his voice
[1:09:54] it's about that voice you recognize
[1:09:56] there's something about that voice
[1:09:59] just like with jesus they said he spoke
[1:10:02] he didn't speak like the pharisees and
[1:10:04] the priests but he spoke
[1:10:07] with
[1:10:07] authority
[1:10:10] he knew what he was talking about
[1:10:13] that's the way the prophet was he knew
[1:10:15] what he was talking about
[1:10:17] and he never had to back up
[1:10:20] that right
[1:10:22] so let me just say that
[1:10:24] that it's important
[1:10:26] that you know
[1:10:27] the holy spirit's voice
[1:10:31] amen one thing i listened i listened to
[1:10:33] a couple of brother band messages on a
[1:10:35] shepherd and so forth
[1:10:36] and the one thing that he said that i i
[1:10:39] really liked
[1:10:41] he talks about that when you come in
[1:10:42] that door okay when you come into the
[1:10:44] door the sheep falls forth i am the door
[1:10:47] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[1:10:49] saved and shall go in and out and find
[1:10:51] pastor
[1:10:52] amen so once you're in christ once you
[1:10:54] come inside that door how many knows
[1:10:57] that's when you are
[1:10:59] safe
[1:11:02] you are safe because i looked up
[1:11:04] on syria and so forth and i wasn't on
[1:11:06] syria it was on my search program and
[1:11:08] one of the last things it talked about
[1:11:09] and i took a picture of it was about a
[1:11:11] shepherd and bought four different
[1:11:13] things and four major things that a
[1:11:16] shepherd does is protect
[1:11:20] okay
[1:11:21] protect from the danger protect from
[1:11:22] wolves protect and protect and then the
[1:11:24] other thing is that he feeds them
[1:11:27] and he leads them
[1:11:30] all right
[1:11:31] those are two other things he feeds the
[1:11:33] sheep he leads the sheep
[1:11:36] but a lot of it is about
[1:11:38] protection and as the prophet of god
[1:11:41] said there ain't no sickness there ain't
[1:11:43] nothing that can come on you
[1:11:45] unless he comes across jesus first
[1:11:48] because you're in there
[1:11:51] huh
[1:11:52] what evidence he makes a statement and
[1:11:54] makes a point that whatever does come
[1:11:56] upon you it is god
[1:11:59] allowing it
[1:12:01] to give you a testimony to try you or
[1:12:04] whatever it might be right
[1:12:06] something that god has allowed but it
[1:12:07] can't just come in there any other way
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:12] and doing
[1:12:13] the devil can't touch you
[1:12:15] without having god's permission
[1:12:17] isn't that good
[1:12:19] to know that you're under the protection
[1:12:20] of god once you come inside the
[1:12:22] shepherd's door
[1:12:24] nothing can harm you
[1:12:27] i believe david said i will not fear
[1:12:29] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:12:31] shadow of death for thou
[1:12:33] art
[1:12:34] with me
[1:12:37] fears nothing
[1:12:39] aren't you glad for that
[1:12:42] my sheep hear
[1:12:43] my voice
[1:12:45] amen
[1:12:50] say it came to my mind
[1:12:52] and that is that you have to keep calm
[1:12:55] how many sheep have to stay calm you get
[1:12:57] a bunch of sheep riled up they run every
[1:12:59] direction and then it'll be chaos
[1:13:02] keep the sheep calm wolf what he does he
[1:13:05] gets the sheep all disturbed
[1:13:08] gets it all everybody all riled up and
[1:13:10] disturbed
[1:13:12] huh
[1:13:14] how many knows that's my job my job is
[1:13:16] to say no just calm down
[1:13:18] huh stop what you're doing
[1:13:21] huh
[1:13:25] and to watch out for the sheep
[1:13:31] all right
[1:13:32] so
[1:13:34] i like this other scripture that i ran
[1:13:35] into in verse 16 of chapter 10 if you're
[1:13:38] with me
[1:13:38] and other sheep have i
[1:13:43] aren't you glad you had some more sheep
[1:13:46] he said i've got some more sheep which
[1:13:48] are not of this fold in other words
[1:13:50] you'll come at another time
[1:13:52] right
[1:13:53] them also most i bring and they
[1:13:58] shall
[1:13:59] hear
[1:14:00] my voice
[1:14:04] [Applause]
[1:14:06] aren't you glad
[1:14:09] it's not maybe
[1:14:11] if you are
[1:14:13] part of those sheep that was
[1:14:15] you know enter into the kingdom of
[1:14:17] heaven that was prepared for you from
[1:14:19] the foundation of the world right
[1:14:23] if you are a part of those sheep you
[1:14:26] will hear his voice
[1:14:30] amen

[1:16:11] how did brother brahm talk about how
[1:16:13] that you know this is the age and all
[1:16:14] the prophets and even himself if he has
[1:16:17] been back on the eons of time and god
[1:16:19] would ask him what age do you want to be
[1:16:22] in
[1:16:23] what was his answer
[1:16:25] it had been right here at the end he
[1:16:27] said this is this is the time
[1:16:31] the most wicked as horrible as eight but

[1:16:54] i don't believe we're gonna be dragged
[1:16:56] out there and tied to a pole and a big
[1:16:58] bunch of wood set on fire and our skin
[1:17:01] melt right off of us until we die
[1:17:03] huh
[1:17:04] no not burned at the stake fed the lions
[1:17:07] and so forth

[1:17:14] that wants to consume all your time
[1:17:17] that you don't have any time for god
[1:17:20] bam the devil got you right there if you
[1:17:22] ain't got time for god the devil's got
[1:17:24] you

[1:17:27] going to make time for god huh
[1:17:30] that was god for you
[1:17:34] oh my
[1:17:35] could go a long ways down there right
[1:17:38] the lord is my shepherd
[1:17:40] my i shall not walk now you know david
[1:17:42] knew what it was like to be a shepherd
[1:17:45] he knew what it was like to lay down his
[1:17:47] life for the sheep
[1:17:50] that's how serious david was about his
[1:17:53] sheep just one little sheep maybe one
[1:17:56] little lamb
[1:17:58] all right
[1:18:02] the lion got it in his mouth and carried
[1:18:04] it off david said you give me back my
[1:18:06] little sheep you give me back my little
[1:18:08] lamb
[1:18:09] went after him killed that lion
[1:18:11] in the same way with the bear
[1:18:13] if it was going to cost him his life he
[1:18:15] was going to get it back
[1:18:17] but there's something down in here huh
[1:18:21] i imagine he said a prayer don't you
[1:18:24] just like he said to goliath before
[1:18:27] before he met him he said you come to me
[1:18:28] with a sword and spear but i come to you
[1:18:31] in the name of the law
[1:18:33] right
[1:18:34] i ain't i ain't coming by myself
[1:18:39] and if you would just open your eyes
[1:18:41] right now i've got to open your eyes
[1:18:42] like he did to his eye elijah's servant
[1:18:45] and see the angels that's around here
[1:18:47] with drawn swords you would drop your
[1:18:49] sword and cry like a baby and run the
[1:18:51] other way
[1:18:54] because you know he was going to lose
[1:18:58] and david knew who was with him
[1:19:01] how many is glad that he's with you
[1:19:04] i'm glad that he's with me
[1:19:07] all right
[1:19:09] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:19:12] pastures amen
[1:19:14] he leadeth me besides still waters
[1:19:18] oh my
[1:19:19] i mean say i love those places
[1:19:23] that's peaceful oh
[1:19:25] i've got peace like a river i got peace
[1:19:28] like a river
[1:19:29] huh
[1:19:31] just flowing all over me
[1:19:34] my cup is full and running over
[1:19:38] he knew what it was like to be in a
[1:19:40] peaceful nice wonderful place
[1:19:42] but we're going to talk about leadership
[1:19:44] for a while
[1:19:47] all right he leadeth me
[1:19:49] not isn't that what a shepherd does
[1:19:51] he leadeth us he leads us
[1:19:56] he leadeth me he leadeth me amen
[1:20:00] besides still waters he restoreth my
[1:20:02] soul again he leadeth me in the paths of
[1:20:06] righteousness for his name state
[1:20:09] every one of us has to realize that
[1:20:10] that's what god is doing with us every
[1:20:12] single day is trying to lead us into
[1:20:15] greater
[1:20:16] righteousness or have you reached that
[1:20:19] place already you don't need to go any
[1:20:20] more
[1:20:21] no i think we all could say i need to
[1:20:23] get a little bit deeper in his
[1:20:24] righteousness
[1:20:26] oh yeah
[1:20:28] and here you want to stop here for a
[1:20:30] little bit
[1:20:31] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:20:33] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[1:20:36] for thou art with me thyroid and thy
[1:20:39] staff
[1:20:40] they comfort me
[1:20:43] this valley of the shadow of death
[1:20:45] according to the prophet it's not some
[1:20:46] valley of dying but he says this is the
[1:20:48] valley of death right here it has a
[1:20:50] shadow in it is it the shadow of death
[1:20:52] right here because as much as life as he
[1:20:54] can have there's a shadow of death
[1:20:57] if you got eternal life you're never
[1:20:58] going gonna die this man down on the
[1:21:00] inside of his body here never gonna die
[1:21:04] how many knows when you take that last
[1:21:05] breath you step right over into another
[1:21:07] body and continue right on this body is
[1:21:10] that shadow it has death in it
[1:21:12] and though i walk through this world so
[1:21:14] to speak i will fear some evil no i will
[1:21:17] fear no
[1:21:19] evil for thou art with me
[1:21:23] i want to say i highly doubt that david
[1:21:27] experienced fear
[1:21:29] going after that bear or going after
[1:21:31] that line because you can't have fear
[1:21:33] and faith at the same time
[1:21:36] you can't do much there's a lot of
[1:21:37] people that can do a lot of that because
[1:21:39] they're scared to death
[1:21:41] but not in david's case he had perfect
[1:21:43] confidence that god was going to take
[1:21:45] care of him
[1:21:50] how many is he like that tonight
[1:21:52] perfect confidence
[1:21:54] that god is going to take care of me
[1:22:02] and you know
[1:22:08] david and the leadership
[1:22:14] of the holy ghost
[1:22:20] isn't always
[1:22:22] in green pastures
[1:22:25] not always
[1:22:27] by still waters
[1:22:29] amen
[1:22:31] as the song says in grady and grady
[1:22:36] and shady
[1:22:37] green pastures
[1:22:39] so rich and so sweet god leads his dear
[1:22:42] children along
[1:22:44] huh
[1:22:45] before the waters cool flow bathes the
[1:22:48] weary one's feet oh he's so sweet
[1:22:50] sometimes god leads his dear children
[1:22:53] along but some he leaps through the
[1:22:56] waters
[1:22:57] some may lead through the flood some
[1:23:00] through the fire
[1:23:02] but all through the blood
[1:23:04] some through great sorrow but god gives
[1:23:07] a song
[1:23:09] in the night seasons and all the day
[1:23:11] long
[1:23:17] david
[1:23:22] david's men
[1:23:25] after saul tried to spear him to the
[1:23:27] wall with his spirit time or two
[1:23:30] he decided it was time for him to hit
[1:23:32] the road
[1:23:33] so he hid the road
[1:23:37] but somehow or other this evil spirit
[1:23:39] that got on saul wasn't happy with david
[1:23:41] being gone
[1:23:43] he went after him
[1:23:45] he wanted to kill the guy
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:49] and things got pretty hectic for david
[1:23:51] for quite a while
[1:23:53] and he had come to find out there's many
[1:23:55] a man many of men that joined up with
[1:23:57] david
[1:23:58] and they're right
[1:24:00] and so not david had to shepherd all of
[1:24:02] these men
[1:24:04] because david was following the great
[1:24:06] shepherd
[1:24:07] how many knows god was his shepherd and
[1:24:09] he knew it
[1:24:11] but it came to pass one time
[1:24:14] many times god led david
[1:24:18] put a deep sleep on saul to where i
[1:24:20] believe it was david
[1:24:22] walked right down into the camp and took
[1:24:23] a
[1:24:24] piece of cloth and cut it off of david's
[1:24:26] coat not david but saw his coat
[1:24:29] went up on the hill and this i
[1:24:31] believe in the bible happened twice
[1:24:35] the first time he says you are a man
[1:24:36] better than me and and you go on your
[1:24:39] way
[1:24:40] but then he got his bad attitude back
[1:24:42] again went after him again several times
[1:24:44] got delivered saw it into david's hand
[1:24:46] but he would not touch
[1:24:48] god's anointed
[1:24:51] huh isn't that right
[1:24:53] i believe it's david saul david's armor
[1:24:55] bearer somebody yelled down there to to
[1:24:58] or was it david that yelled
[1:25:00] saul's armor bear and his protector he
[1:25:02] says you deserve to die
[1:25:06] because you let somebody come into the
[1:25:07] camp and do that to your master
[1:25:11] you deserve to die somebody touched the
[1:25:13] anointed of the lord
[1:25:15] amen
[1:25:17] and just because god had ordained him he
[1:25:20] was the king of israel okay we wouldn't
[1:25:21] go kill him
[1:25:23] but anyway many times sweet wonderful
[1:25:26] victories he escaped many times
[1:25:29] but one time
[1:25:32] he knew what it was like to be led
[1:25:35] through
[1:25:36] great sorrow
[1:25:41] and it came to pass when david and his
[1:25:42] men would come to ziglag on the third
[1:25:44] day that the amalekites
[1:25:46] i know the zig lag is where david was
[1:25:48] staying
[1:25:49] with all of his men
[1:25:52] the malachites had invaded the south and
[1:25:53] ziglag was and smit smitten zig lag and
[1:25:57] burnt it with fire
[1:26:01] and had taken the women captive that
[1:26:03] were therein and they slew not any
[1:26:05] neither great or small but carried them
[1:26:06] all away and went their way so david and
[1:26:08] his men came to this city and behold it
[1:26:10] was burnt with fire
[1:26:14] huh can you imagine coming home and
[1:26:16] everything burnt
[1:26:18] in anybody's mind you would think that
[1:26:21] everybody's dead
[1:26:23] if they're going to burn the whole city
[1:26:25] down they're very
[1:26:26] capable of church
[1:26:29] it's about killing anybody right
[1:26:31] so there you are wondering if there's
[1:26:32] anybody alive
[1:26:34] you come back and your heart drops out
[1:26:37] of your chest
[1:26:39] you have no more strength
[1:26:41] perhaps you know we can go through
[1:26:43] things that make us so weak you just
[1:26:44] drop down on your knees you can't even
[1:26:46] stand anymore
[1:26:47] seeing people do it
[1:26:51] all right david and his men came to the
[1:26:53] city and behold he was burnt with fire
[1:26:55] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:26:56] daughters were taken captives
[1:26:59] and david and the people that were with
[1:27:00] him lifted up their voice and wept until
[1:27:03] they had no more
[1:27:04] power
[1:27:05] too weak
[1:27:09] huh some through great sorrow
[1:27:14] and david's two wives were taken captive
[1:27:18] i hate oh
[1:27:20] i can't explain
[1:27:22] ahem
[1:27:25] and just the jezreelites and abigail the
[1:27:27] wife of nabal
[1:27:29] and david was greatly distressed
[1:27:33] people for the people spake
[1:27:35] of stoning him
[1:27:38] because the soul of all men
[1:27:40] oh no the soul of all the people
[1:27:43] was grieved
[1:27:45] for every man for his sons and his
[1:27:47] daughters
[1:27:49] but
[1:27:51] david
[1:27:52] encouraged himself in the lord
[1:27:58] there was talk
[1:28:00] of them killing him
[1:28:03] let me tell you at this time these men
[1:28:05] did not have much for david's leadership
[1:28:10] why because things have went so wrong
[1:28:14] no promise of seeing your children hello
[1:28:17] don't we love our children
[1:28:19] our wives and our children all gone
[1:28:22] how could something this terrible happen
[1:28:24] we ask that a lot of times don't we how
[1:28:27] can something this terrible happen
[1:28:33] god allows it
[1:28:35] because listen god isn't isn't in just
[1:28:38] into taking care of the sheep and
[1:28:40] and making everything green pastures and
[1:28:43] nice and soft and comfortable he's also
[1:28:46] training sons and daughters
[1:28:49] how many he's in the business of
[1:28:51] training us
[1:28:55] amen
[1:28:57] and i think there's a lot to be said
[1:29:00] that in our hearts we're to have the
[1:29:02] nature
[1:29:04] every bit of it the nature of a sheep
[1:29:07] meek
[1:29:08] and lowly like jesus was i know jesus
[1:29:10] was the lamb of god
[1:29:11] that took away the word he was meek and
[1:29:13] lowly
[1:29:15] that's the way we're supposed to be meek
[1:29:16] readily to follow the word ready to
[1:29:18] follow christ
[1:29:20] amen at the same time
[1:29:22] really to follow him
[1:29:24] no matter where
[1:29:26] he leads
[1:29:28] no matter through what he leads
[1:29:32] where he leads me i
[1:29:35] will follow i want to sing that maybe
[1:29:37] here yet where he leads me i will follow
[1:29:42] hey we got our whole future head i mean
[1:29:45] believe that you got your whole future
[1:29:46] head we don't know what's going to
[1:29:47] happen yet
[1:29:48] but whatever happens as long as he's
[1:29:50] with us we're all right
[1:29:53] aren't you glad of that
[1:29:56] greatly distressed he encouraged himself
[1:29:59] in the lord he is god
[1:30:01] and david said to i bethar he the priest
[1:30:05] a himalayan son
[1:30:07] i pray thee bring me hither and ephod
[1:30:10] and
[1:30:11] apathar brought thither the ephod to
[1:30:13] david
[1:30:14] and david inquired at the lord
[1:30:17] saying shall i pursue after this troop
[1:30:21] shall i overtake them
[1:30:23] oh i imagine jesus david has some
[1:30:26] serious ants questions for the lord
[1:30:28] don't you think are we ever going to see
[1:30:31] our wives are we ever going to see our
[1:30:33] family again
[1:30:35] i don't know lord please give me an
[1:30:37] answer
[1:30:38] please tell me
[1:30:40] what should i do shall i pursue him can
[1:30:42] i overtake him
[1:30:45] and he answered
[1:30:46] i like that i mean please just listen to
[1:30:49] that still small voice
[1:30:51] how many please it never leads you wrong
[1:30:54] you'll know when it's the right voice
[1:30:55] god will always tell you to do good
[1:30:57] thing the right thing he'll tell you
[1:31:00] he'll never tell you to do wrong
[1:31:03] and he said pursue
[1:31:06] i like it
[1:31:08] david's heart was going to come back
[1:31:12] into his chest
[1:31:14] he's going to receive strength in his
[1:31:16] veins and arms and legs again because at
[1:31:18] this point i highly doubt he had much
[1:31:20] strength in any part of his body
[1:31:22] and neither did his men
[1:31:26] pursue
[1:31:28] for thou shalt surely overtake them
[1:31:34] amen
[1:31:35] well that's good i'm glad we're going to
[1:31:37] catch up with them
[1:31:40] all right
[1:31:41] now i know that much but the best is yet
[1:31:43] to come
[1:31:45] and
[1:31:46] without fail recover
[1:31:50] oh
[1:31:51] i like those
[1:31:53] without fail
[1:31:54] and recover all don't you
[1:31:56] you're going to without fail
[1:31:58] recover
[1:31:59] a double l
[1:32:02] he could go back to his men and say look
[1:32:04] the lord told me that we're going to go
[1:32:06] pursue him yeah the house is going to be
[1:32:08] rebuilt all of that there life can't be
[1:32:11] given back if it's taken perhaps you
[1:32:13] can't if god wants to but listen we're
[1:32:15] going to have all our wife we're going
[1:32:16] to get all our kids back
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:21] what a shepherd
[1:32:23] david
[1:32:24] inquired amen he was following the great
[1:32:27] shepherd
[1:32:28] and he got everything back
[1:32:31] that he lost
[1:32:33] he went he pursued
[1:32:35] they all got it back i'll tell you what
[1:32:37] no matter where god leads you god will
[1:32:40] never lead you into any place
[1:32:42] that he can't keep you
[1:32:45] aren't you glad for that that's if
[1:32:48] you are a sheep
[1:32:50] this does not go
[1:32:52] this does not apply
[1:32:54] to goats
[1:32:56] no the goats don't want to follow
[1:32:59] huh
[1:33:00] how many knows
[1:33:01] most of israel was goats
[1:33:04] and following moses most of israel was
[1:33:07] goats
[1:33:09] they could never just submit themselves
[1:33:13] i mean after everything that god did
[1:33:16] with moses in egypt
[1:33:18] there shouldn't have been one israelite
[1:33:20] and they have any question that moses
[1:33:23] was god's man
[1:33:25] that he was their shepherd
[1:33:27] that he was going to lead him out
[1:33:28] because god had told moses go down there
[1:33:30] lead my people out
[1:33:33] that right
[1:33:35] but they did
[1:33:36] they constantly questioned it
[1:33:39] constantly wondered well i don't know
[1:33:42] for sure you boy
[1:33:45] it seems like god would just make it all
[1:33:47] easy and all nice
[1:33:49] but he doesn't i mean it was that that
[1:33:51] doesn't make it all nina easy nice and
[1:33:53] as i was thinking about trials and
[1:33:55] preaching on trials a lot i wanted to
[1:33:57] make this statement folks i don't know
[1:33:59] about you but i've had enough trials to
[1:34:00] last me last time i'm good
[1:34:05] i'm good i don't ask for any more trials

[1:34:29] a certain level
[1:34:30] god eases up on you huh
[1:34:33] i believe it

[1:34:43] grade you don't need to go back to high
[1:34:45] school amen
[1:34:47] now you need to learn
[1:34:49] deeper things
[1:34:52] amen but we're always learning how to
[1:34:53] believe that we're always learning
[1:34:55] god is always teaching us new things
[1:34:58] how to be more surrendered to god
[1:35:02] amen all a lot of things
[1:35:05] but moses let's talk about him for just
[1:35:07] a few minutes
[1:35:09] moses shepherd moses
[1:35:12] finally got the sheep together and there
[1:35:15] was a bunch of them two million sheep
[1:35:17] let them out
[1:35:20] when finally come down to where pharaoh
[1:35:22] just said let's go just eat everything
[1:35:26] and leave
[1:35:28] all of the guards stood back no more
[1:35:30] guarding a man no more you can't go out
[1:35:33] or we'll kill you everybody went back
[1:35:36] just go on everybody could go out free
[1:35:37] they got everything they could imagine
[1:35:40] and all of the egyptians say so much
[1:35:42] knew that god was with them that they
[1:35:44] were good to them give them tools and
[1:35:46] gold and everything else
[1:35:48] empty their jewelry boxes and give it to
[1:35:50] them hey here you know
[1:35:52] take this let this help you you're real
[1:35:55] generous
[1:35:57] basically swallowed the egyptian took
[1:35:58] off
[1:36:00] praising the lord and hallelujah glory
[1:36:03] to god oh they were having a time
[1:36:05] weren't they
[1:36:09] until it came to the water
[1:36:12] amen
[1:36:14] some through
[1:36:16] the water
[1:36:18] some through
[1:36:19] the flood
[1:36:20] from what i understand it was flood time
[1:36:22] right
[1:36:24] amen to come up to the red sea there it
[1:36:26] was flood time and
[1:36:28] come down there and even the shepherd
[1:36:30] didn't know what to do
[1:36:32] even he was baffled
[1:36:35] even he began to cry out oh what am i
[1:36:37] gonna do what are we gonna do
[1:36:39] and that's probably good put it
[1:36:41] god kind of rebuked him
[1:36:43] and that right got finished with his
[1:36:45] crying and his whining
[1:36:47] look who's leading you look who's with
[1:36:49] you
[1:36:50] i'm no need to whine and cry look who's
[1:36:54] with you
[1:36:56] amen rely on him
[1:37:00] how many believes that god loves to
[1:37:02] bring us to places to we can't get over
[1:37:04] under around it then he can be our
[1:37:06] shepherd
[1:37:07] then he can lead us
[1:37:10] because i'm here to tell you we as human
[1:37:12] beings we are programmed to do it
[1:37:14] ourself
[1:37:16] i can do this
[1:37:17] i can do this
[1:37:19] god has to bring us to a place to where
[1:37:21] no you can't
[1:37:23] no
[1:37:23] no no it doesn't go you oh boy i'll tell
[1:37:26] you just when we really find out what
[1:37:28] we're made of when it doesn't go the way
[1:37:30] you think it ought to go
[1:37:32] not the way you want it to go
[1:37:35] and there ain't nothing you can do about
[1:37:37] it then we find out if your hair stays
[1:37:39] straight up and your face get puffs up
[1:37:41] and
[1:37:42] you get angry like a toad ball frog
[1:37:44] eating buckshot
[1:37:49] why because you want to do it we all
[1:37:50] want to do it i'm going to make this
[1:37:52] happen
[1:37:53] no
[1:37:55] no no no
[1:37:57] folks sometimes when we get that way to
[1:37:58] god he'll just he'll make it that much
[1:38:00] worse for us
[1:38:02] it'll just get worse
[1:38:06] yeah
[1:38:07] to get you down to make you realize
[1:38:09] you're not going to do this
[1:38:12] oh my i know all about it get down on
[1:38:16] your knees and let god do it
[1:38:19] start relying on god start following him
[1:38:22] how many times my they follow me they
[1:38:24] follow me they follow me every time
[1:38:26] jesus said my sheep follow me
[1:38:28] they don't guide me they don't get ahead
[1:38:30] of me
[1:38:33] and i'm told that whenever there's two
[1:38:35] shepherds
[1:38:36] maybe side by side or whatever
[1:38:39] every one of those sheep of that pastor
[1:38:42] that shepherd they know the shepherd's
[1:38:44] voice
[1:38:45] and another shepherd can make the same
[1:38:47] sound they don't even listen to it
[1:38:49] it ain't got the right sound huh
[1:38:53] that's where sometimes sheep and
[1:38:54] churches man they'll get to say well
[1:38:56] brother donnie's said this or this one
[1:38:57] said that hey no two people are going to
[1:38:59] see the light so don't go listen too
[1:39:01] many voices you'll get confused
[1:39:05] huh
[1:39:06] on certain things anyway
[1:39:09] that's right don't you just develop the
[1:39:11] just love when somebody comes to me now
[1:39:12] brother why don't i disagree with you on
[1:39:14] this because somebody else said this

[1:39:17] church

[1:39:35] but isn't it wonderful
[1:39:37] isn't it wonderful
[1:39:38] that moses had a shepherd
[1:39:41] moses was following the great shepherd
[1:39:43] and when he said what am i going to do
[1:39:45] what did god he responded how many
[1:39:47] beliefs that god's going to respond
[1:39:50] to your situation
[1:39:53] if you have him as your leader he will
[1:39:55] respond to your situation if you have
[1:39:58] faith in him and believe him and trust
[1:40:01] him and commit yourself to him
[1:40:04] he will lead you out
[1:40:08] he will lead you through
[1:40:12] folks he'll bust the world down to get
[1:40:14] you through he's not going to get you up
[1:40:16] against a rock and a hard place not to
[1:40:18] be able to get you through that
[1:40:21] amen

[1:40:25] i'm so thankful for that
[1:40:27] and folks i'm here to tell you
[1:40:29] we in this generation are between a rock
[1:40:31] and a hard place
[1:40:34] amen
[1:40:35] brother jerry
[1:40:37] browning i believe i've preached for him
[1:40:38] one time he always mentions brother
[1:40:40] i'll never forget that sermon you
[1:40:42] preached on there and i said what in the
[1:40:43] world did i preach he says between a
[1:40:44] rock and a hard place
[1:40:48] yeah god brings you to that rock place
[1:40:51] but listen it's amazing how he'll take
[1:40:53] you over it now even the prophet of god
[1:40:55] said the same thing he says that's one
[1:40:57] of the greatest miracles he's ever had
[1:40:59] that he has ever seen
[1:41:01] when he couldn't get over it he couldn't
[1:41:02] get under he can't get around it
[1:41:05] and then just
[1:41:06] watch
[1:41:07] just
[1:41:08] trust in him
[1:41:10] and watch him open that door
[1:41:12] he will put a hole in that rock wall
[1:41:14] like you ain't never seen

[1:41:19] god leads his children along
[1:41:21] he opened up the waters even they made
[1:41:23] songs and
[1:41:24] and stuff about how did he dried up the
[1:41:27] muddy waters
[1:41:29] the ground under can you imagine how
[1:41:31] muddy that was
[1:41:33] that had to be a muddle
[1:41:35] and he dried it to where they could

[1:41:51] and i want to see the great big walls
[1:41:52] how high they were
[1:41:54] perhaps watch the wind come down and
[1:41:56] just dry that right up

[1:42:01] hours to dry it up do you think

[1:42:05] fever blows a little bit it just hardens
[1:42:08] right up

[1:42:44] and made servants out of them and beat
[1:42:46] them and treated them like a bunch of
[1:42:48] slaves
