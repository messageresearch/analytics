========================================

no matter what you're doing whether you're going to a boxing match or whether you're running a race and when you do all that those people those type of people that do that they have to prepare to eat the right food they have to do the right exercises in that right then they have to drink the right drinks they have to do everything just right amen to get ready for what they are doing amen i believe that's the way it is with the bride of jesus christ if we're going to be ready for a rapture we're going to have to eat the right thing we're going to have to exercise what we eat and do so forth aiming and all of that and so if you'll notice here that i just wanted to pick this thought up from this is that after paul said all of that about the running and about the being temperate and all of that he talks begins to talk about his body in that right his body he talks about his body and how that he has to bring his body i keep under my body and bring it into subjection amen i believe the prophet of god said one of the signs that you're amen headed for the rapture and and we're heading for the rapture getting ready for the rapture is when your body comes subject to the word of god amen i believe i don't know about you but i certainly feel a pull in my heart just as the let me just say this way hell is pulling the evil people towards it rapidly and they're right they're heading towards hell really really fast it's pulling them i mean just in the last five six years we've seen our nation endorse homosexuality by the supreme court you know and then going into uh you know letting our kids decide what gender they want to be it's just really fast it's just no end how low will they do and so forth but they're heading that way but if we're the bride of jesus christ we're going to be pulled in another direction amen and i trust that everybody here and i know that you do because of the response that that i get from amen the word of god amen and us pulling towards the word we're being pulled towards the word amen and that's what we want to talk about tonight being pulled towards the word and of course i've preached on this many times but you just bear with me amen because we first of all we want to talk about our greatest enemy now let's start with this and see if i can turn this on i can do i need to push this button right here that turns it on are you going to pull it up for me all right i call it the real enemy amen the real enemy amen amen our our greatest enemy i mean we already know what it is right we know what the greatest enemy is i love to talk about this you know uh i'm glad i'm not ambushing many night or baptist folks because this this here is way deeper than all of that how many knows we're in a way deeper than a baptist or a pentecostal that just thinks that if you speak in tongues up here at the altar that you got holy ghost you're saved how many knows that's not very deep at all amen we know that they'll go out there lie cheat and steal and everything else we know that isn't it amen it's much deeper than that and then to find out who our real enemy is and where the real battle is where the real war is amen let me see if i can go on with this to the next one all right well i gotta turn it on first i'm like hey you know what that might just help all right here we go are you all ready all right i push it a little longer maybe there we are all right now that's not okay that's the last one i push that up to the last one let me go backwards huh hold on i'm certainly not looking for that one why does it keep backing all right all right go back one uh this one here all right yeah this will be fine we'll go with this now we are dealing when we're talking about the devil all right how many knows that uh the devil isn't your real enemy because he said now we're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated all right sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated oh i'm my i wish i had twice my size or maybe i'd feel twice as good he said brother beats on the pulpit we are disputing with a conquered enemy no wonder paul could say when there was in the building block to chop his head off he said oh death where is your sting show me where you can make me squirm and scream grave where is your victory and you think you'll mold me out there i'll point you to an empty one over here and i'm in him and he'll raise me up in the last days a defeated enemy amen so the devil's not your enemy anymore he's completely defeated he's powerless he's stripped of every rights that he has isn't he how many sled for that praise be to god all right so let's go to the next one and as far as christ he can't do nothing for you either all right that's good that's exactly right now notice god's provision for divine healing was on the basis of faith and that's the same way he heals them tonight is on the basis of faith know how matter how great man if christ himself was standing here on the pulpit with this suit on that he gave me if he was standing here in this suit he could not heal you wow not at all he has already done it now he might do something to convince you now how many knows that happened in brother branham's ministry what built people's faith what made him actually be able to believe was the discernment and so forth and it built their faith because we all know that there was a lot of people did not get their healing that was sick out there that needed it people come through the line and get paid for it they didn't get it it all depends on their faith christ couldn't do anything more for you we went and preached the whole message here a couple months ago ago on how that he says how on this very subject before christ can't do anything more for you you have to accept what he's already done because what he said on calvary he said it is finished the work was done it was finished his part is done even if he was standing in there he says he couldn't do a bit for me so now we know that the devil amen he absolutely is powerless now how many knows that the only power that the devil has is in people that give him power all right and listen the devil can't even bother you unless you let him he can't use you unless you let him he can't get to you unless you let him how he believes that when i got to thinking about this and i said most of the time that the way that the devil will try to get to you is through somebody else now how many of those human beings are boy they're complicated to deal with and you got to watch human beings you gotta watch their influence you gotta watch what they do you gotta watch what they say about you because that's most of the time how the devil will try to get to you is through other people that is uh that he's controlling but only if you let him that's why near circumstance why amen your greatest enemy is never anybody else huh your greatest enemy is of whether or not you are going to allow the devil to bother you or not whether you will let him get to you or not and it takes a holy ghost it takes somebody that's real consecrated to god because every one of us walked this journey and we've been hurt by people i've heard probably people heard some of y'all i had to get over it i had to repent hello it's all part of it isn't it right we human beings we're full of mistakes but there's one thing for sure your your your experience can't be based on what somebody else does or whether whether a preacher falls or whether a preacher's dead that can't be what's based on or you'll never stand is that all right so we find that every blessing every blessing in the bible every promise in the book is yours it's already paid for but god can't do anything more for you what does this put it back on it puts it back on your lap and back on my lap both with the devil and with god it's on your lap he can't get to you he's got to get saved just like you got saved if he's ever going to come in where you are unless you go out you have to go out amen and that's all part of this flesh getting in the way amen praise the lord now let me see if i can go the right direction i'm not sure all right i'm flipping it right we're not getting the best of signal green we're good there how's that now all right micah what happened you're going to help me out flipping it up for me all right maybe we'll work that way that's all right we'll work together i used to preach over at the baptist church a little sermon and she said it was called let loose and let god that's right just let loose and let god but as long as you got yourself into it there ain't no way then he says you know what the biggest enemy i got the biggest enemy of god is william branham he's always in god's way if you can just get him out of the way then god can go to work that's your worst enemy is yourself just get yourself out of the way and then god can go to work amen praise the lord listen to what he says here now be careful of your associates when you get out there and get among people and this one begins to tell you this and this one that then you get yourself all mixed up you don't know what you believe not about the truth i mean you gotta watch who you listen to what you listen to could get messed up oh man confused real quick but so there he says that you are your worst enemy not god amen he can't do any more except for what you accept not the devil the devil himself he's already been stripped of his power huh now it comes down into our laps i like this phrase right here he says if you can just get yourself out of the way now that's the big question right there that's the really big question how much are we still in the way how much are we still in the way because i believe that when i look at when i look at promises like where jesus said in saint john the 14th chapter of love he said let me just read it he says listen verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall ye do because i go unto the father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do isn't that a great promise that whatsoever you would ask that he would do amen to be in that place now i ask you i ask everybody in here that question do you feel like you're in the place that that's something that you can say yeah i've i've proven that it's true huh first of all you want to be careful what you ask for right because if you ask and miss you ain't going to get it but if you can be so yielded to god so let by god it should be that when you ask for it god gives it to you see my goal is to become a lot like brother branham [Music] huh brother baby says i can tell you right now he says that i and if anything i've ever asked god for he says he either give it to me or he told me why i wouldn't i couldn't amen i'll tell you if we can get to the place folks get out of our own way so much until we get to the place if we can speak to storms and bulls and hornets will be doing pretty good it may not be storms it may not be bulls it may not be hornets but it'll be something in your life that you need to speak to get to the place where we come in here and say brother also maybe come up here and i got a testimony i'll tell you what i was about to die the other day and i just threw my hands up the love and i just felt the love of god come down he just took care of it all give me a peace and a rest huh see folks we have to think about that just how much of our self is still in the way because i believe that if you ever we get out of the way that we're supposed to every promise in this book is yours and we will see it manifested in a greater way amen i would rather a preacher challenge me than to tell me well it just doesn't happen anymore forget about that it ain't for you and downplay it huh how many knows that even jesus talking about this now where will we get a scripture that talks about our us being the greatest enemy where would we go to see what jesus might say that you are your greatest enemy this is the scripture i come up with in luke 14 and verse 26 26 he says if any man come after me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yay and the last thing he says and his own life also huh in other words yourself you got to hate yourself also amen because how many do this right here this flesh this flesh is your greatest enemy it's the thing that tries to get you to veer off it's so powerful that he would take a prophet of god that he even had to have a cross hanging on his because of all the naked women that were everywhere and that right that even he had to bear that and every time him and so he would look because it's a man's natural tendency isn't that right to go that direction and to look back to the cross and die to yourself and look to the cross isn't that right even he is pulled this flesh is so pulled in paul's way of saying it he says he had such a fighting battle with the flesh until he says i have to die every day i mean believes that's what we got to do we got to die to ourself every day oh my every day we got to die to ourself amen so there he says it our greatest enemy all right now let's go to where the battle is the battle once again is not out there somewhere where's the battle at the greatest battle ever fought two messages that you might want to listen to that'll go along with what we've been preaching about one is the greatest battle ever fought and the other one is uh christ's mystery of god revealed amen so he says listen now notice never started in some mechanical affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization can never never do the work of god because the battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind we got to get our minds right you've got to make your choice it meets you talking about little sick girl come on down to here he says practically the same thing he says listen where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you hey i've got that thing double click there don't i ah the little girl right there i want a little girl yeah i've got the same thing boy that's what happens after you get 59. so it's where where's the battle the battle is in the mind why because that's where the word comes in and then he talks about he says you know it's not a mind over matter thing but this mind has to accept things or it rejects things we all know the things that you think about affect you it makes you what you are and the great battle is right here and you can see in in let's just think about our mind it's a very precious thing a child it most likely is going to be the kind of man that it was raised up and what it was taught in in teaching in the teaching realm is that right we look at our politics today we look at the signs out there the mothers are holding out there and i don't know what all of this uh uh racist thing that they call it they're trying to teach you know to try to teach racism and they got signs up there don't teach my kid hey the government loves they took what the prayer out of school they took discipline out of school and and they teach this that they know how how important it is to catch those kids minds because that's where it starts amen i mean you don't you take the whip out of out of homes you out of the classroom and then what do you got now people out there destroying everything amen and so our mind how many knows our mind is a precious thing and that's where you have to meet the enemy every doubt either faith or doubt right in there is where you meet the devil and you become the kind of person that you allow the thoughts that come into your mind whether it's the word of god or whether it's not the greatest valor has ever fought and it's like when you think about it but abandon when he preached this greatest battle ever fought i don't know if i can shut this down or not right there i'm going to crank it back up see if it works how about that it works when he preached the greatest battle ever fought he began to go into the solar system and then he went into our body soul and consciousness and all of that and he talked about feelings and emotions and all of these things how did all of the flus have to be cleaned out everything has to be straight you have to bring the word of god coming it has to be the center of it all and keep all of that in line isn't that right because you get one memory out of line you remember what somebody did you remember this you think about that and buddy right there it goes boom it can accept your whole world and that right and it's and i got to thinking about how it's like a helicopter oh my you know to me driving a little airplane maybe it wouldn't be all that hard but driving a helicopter from understand you know there's so many foot pedals there's handles there's so many different things that when you drive one of them you really have to know what you're doing and that's a little like the human body that's like this flesh and this body soul and spirit that we're driving amen you have to you have to really be in harmony you have to have it under control if you're going to drive it right are you with me you know it's like driving a car it's very complex and you have to be careful how you do it but brother bram talked about how to he typed with the mechanics and the dynamics of a car and managed to type that with the church how that you know we can't just have the mechanics but you got to have the dynamics with it amen and it's all complex without the power of the holy ghost ruling your life comes right back down to it having that governor folks i'm telling you what you're going to go off in the ditch because guess what this flesh being our biggest enemy it is the one that wants to veer off this way and veer off that way so quickly amen the apostle paul he said that in his hour that there was people that was very spiritual and he said that they were not working at all anymore is that right they were just going from house to house and they were actually busy body in everybody else's matters and see they went extreme so they become so spiritual they were no earthly good you know i don't know about you but i i pity their wives don't you where the next meals come from and everything else their poor wives had to put up with not being supplied for and that was horrible and paul said man if you don't work neither should you eat guess what you're going to go without supper and breakfast if you don't eat well he was trying to tell him to keep the balance in our generation people were so spiritual they sold everything and went out where to move to arizona where brother brother branham was and half of them was on charity and he had to get on questions and answers and give them good old protoplasmic stimulation some correction isn't that right because they were going too far you know so spiritual they don't take care of the natural things amen so you have to keep that balance amen keep the balance of things paul he had the problem with that amen even in our day amen so look you love the lord amen got to keep the balance and this flesh this flesh it's got a it's like a car with a pulling problem i don't know about you but i hate a car or a truck that has a pulling problem don't you bill john he just wants to pull it over he keeps pulling over here pulling over there i won't never forget before i came up to tennessee long time ago moved to tennessee from florida but i'll tell you what it was a good-looking truck it had pretty pretty good wheels on it pretty good looking truck oh my god my guy said let me take my truck let me take your truck to go get a few parts i said go ahead go get him mateos he went hey but he was serious and that's the way our flesh is friend you got to be good to drive this you better have the holy ghost because buddy it'll take you off in left field quicker and you can think isn't that right and you'll end up in the ditch if you don't have the holy let's ghost a scripture over in uh let's look at what paul had to say about it and i'm not sure i'm going to see if this next quote is what i'm looking for take me to the next one michael all right let's just go with this one you see how many believes that if you would really get things right we'd be a powerful people brother ben says in the greatest battle said if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one accord with not one shadow of a doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there would not be nobody here desiring the holy ghost but what would receiving if you could just get that certain thing fixed amen get that certain things picked in other words if you could get the thing in the right track you'd never desire the holy ghost because you'd have it you'd be the kind of person the devil doesn't know what to do with you how many desires to be that the devil doesn't know what to do with you because as long as he has an avenue to get to you that's the avenue that he will take that's the avenue that he will take i don't know if i'll think about this or not but i'ma say well i'm thinking about it but you got to realize one thing that brother brahm said he says you know that over in melchizedek when abraham was coming back from the slaughter of the kings he met melchizedek isn't that right and he talked and he had communion and after abraham he says after the battle after the battle abraham had communion with melchizedek and he says talks about that with us and i think i may have it on here i think i do but anyway he says that you know he said after you get yourself y'all remember what he said whipped get yourself whipped then you can have communion with the lord jesus christ but you got to whip yourself because that's your biggest enemy is yourself amen all right not even a feeble person among us go to the next one if you can i don't seem to be going the right way i'll have to we'll have to try this out later on all right black dog white dog scripture i'm looking for somebody told me one time that we somebody was converted received the holy ghost we all know talk about an indian he said to him how are you getting along he said pretty good and pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty pretty bad and pretty good he said well since he received the holy ghost he said there's been two dogs in me and one of them is a black dog and one of them is a white dog and said they argue all the time isn't that the truth you always got another voice telling you something man you gotta argue back said no get out of here that ain't the thought of god yeah always arguing because your flesh it wants to do one thing when the holy ghost wants to do another oh it's a constant battle all right all right they growl listen they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad hello how many knows this is a answer for anybody struggling with anything say well chief which one of them wins the fight said it depends on which the chief feeds the most so i think that's good answer it just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after thing of god and that does it amen paul let's go to paul romans 8 romans 8 verse 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for that for for what i would that do i not but what i hate that i do amen if then i do that which i would not i can send unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth some good things no it says no good thing let me tell you there's only one way that this flesh will ever desire the right things and that's when the nature of it is changed that is the nature of the holy ghost it's not hard to turn your head it's not hard to do right not hard to do any of those things when you've got the right nature in there but if everybody knows that if you tilt that and you not feed on the holy ghost you're not where you ought to be it ain't no time just stop praying for a day or so and find out how quickly you get ill how quickly your temper flares up how quickly you get carnal amen that's right if i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good things for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not and the evil which i would not that i do we find ourselves making more mistakes sometimes than we are the good that we know we should do amen what does this mean this means that you are not feeding the white dog enough that's right you're not feeding on god enough because there's no excuses huh it just depends on who you're gonna let let let do it because god voted for you satan voted against you which way are you going to go what are you going to do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find in a law that when i would do good his evil is always present with me oh man i would love to be able to say look there's going to be a come a time when you're going to come to perfection and you'll never make any more mistakes but that's simply not the truth is now you shouldn't do willful sin but we're still going to make mistakes you're going to flub up you're going to lean to the right you're going to get off that center line until the day you die because you're human amen but i do believe that a person can walk with god amen for i delight in the law of the lord after the inward man i like that but i see another law working in my members warning against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my member oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god that through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind myself i serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin amen so the law this the law that the flesh has is the law of sin it always wants to do wrong always pulling it the wrong way day after day and if you don't die daily that thing will rise back up but this is the scripture i really like and that is the next chapter aren't you glad for a chapter eight i'm glad for a chapter eight if there was no chapter eight we'd be all in trouble paul says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh amen but after the spirit in other words you're always seeking to please the spirit let's go down to the uh verse chapter four verse four now notice that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh isn't that the truth but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit amen for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the lord of god neither indeed can be so that they that are in the flesh cannot please god boy wow everyone might stop right there step right there and say well i'm in the flesh so i think nobody can ever please god because we're in the flesh no read on but ye are not in the flesh he's not saying that's not where you're living but that's not what you're pleasing that's not what you're serving you're not serving the flesh you're serving the spirit your flesh it doesn't want to get up in the morning how many loves to get up in the morning go to work oh hallelujah i'll tell you what i thought about saying this i thought man if somebody says i love it i said well never mind you know some people just love the work i love that alarm going b b no but you have to make yourself just like your flesh a lot of times doesn't want to go to church doesn't want to pray it doesn't really read a bible don't but get more of the holy ghost in there and you can't wait for the doors to open you can't wait to open the bible you can't wait to listen to another tape amen why because we're not supposed to be in the flesh we're supposed to be in the spirit amen but in the spirit now notice and if so be the spirit of god dwell in you now notice now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his that's where we get to sin unless you're filled with almighty god or unless you're filled with the holy ghost you're not his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness and if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead will also quicken your mortal body amen by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh we shall die but listen to this i like this but if ye through the spirit mortify from what i understand that's cleanse cleanse the deeds of the body he shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god amen so i look at that i think about that if we truly would whip ourselves nobody would truly be needing the holy ghost we have victory in our lives someone who believes that if you'd whip yourself completely whip yourself your mind your heart your soul completely to surrender to god see god this is yours i'm your property amen i believe we have peace that passes understanding because it's there for us we have joy unspeakable and full of glory amen there's every promise in here i believe we could move mountains i believe we could ask whatever things we desire and we'd receive them amen i wrote down here i believe that we would be the kind of husbands that we were supposed to be we'd be kind of wives that were supposed to be if you'd really whip yourself you would totally be the kind of neighbor that you'd need to be you'd be the kind of pastor that you need to be you'd have to be the kind of you'd be the kind of sister that you need to be if we would just get out of the way as we see that quote amen get out of the way and let god do just be the kind of friends we could be the kind of bosses that we should be a real christian boss amen we'd be like our prophet because our prophet was like christ amen that's my heart's desire and yours that's how i want to be be like the prophet because he was like christ and ultimately will be like christ like paul said follow me as i follow christ amen you love him tonight so it's on us honey believes it's on us it's on every one of us it's in our lap what will you do he's waiting on you he's waiting for you to believe without a shadow of a doubt if you want if you listen i wrote this on the way sometimes i get things on the way i said honey write this on a piece of paper somewhere if you want to get something from god you have to be like the woman that was called a dog the bible says that he that cometh god that he must he that comes to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently sometimes god really wants to see how much you mean it am right he wants to see how persevered you are just like he did with that woman he wanted to teach just how desperate how dis you know desperate she was and how perseverant she was and i believe that god's way god and i believe that god knows amen be certain of god you all remember but abraham says he says sometimes it don't seem like god answers like god don't answer like god don't answer but he's just seeing how much you really mean it but he'll come through you can receive it if you truly believe it you set your mind on and say god i won't take no for an answer amen i'm trusting you it's your word it's it's my right amen god bless you let's stand tonight amen musicians if you want to come let's bow our heads i don't know about you brothers and sisters but when i read the word when i look at this i realize how much growing that i still have to do how much room there is for growth in my life how about you would you raise your hands i know there's a lot of growth for me i really need to grow into presence of almighty god and to be more like him and realizing that my biggest enemy everything that the barrier that keeps me from joy the barrier that keeps me from victory the barrier that keeps me from these things is not somewhere out there it's me it's myself it's my unbelief it's my mind it's my heart it's where i'm at it's me i'm gonna have to fight the thing i'm gonna have to get through this barrier of self and trust in god and commit myself to god in such a way until i can see the promises of god coming to pass in my life lord jesus you see the hands all over our hands are up saying god we see where we still need to grow lord well we still need to get closer to you lord and to be more like you father until we see the promises of god being made manifest in our lives until we see the word becoming flesh even as your prophet said we're living an hour now but the word is becoming flesh lord help that to be our testimony lord the people of this church god that their word is actually coming and becoming their flesh we see it
