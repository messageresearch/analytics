[2:10] shall be denied before the angels of god

[36:20] world is getting darker it's important
[36:23] that you have a good
[36:24] church home him in somewhere where you
[36:26] go to church and get fed all the time
[36:28] amen because
[36:30] it's time to buckle up the armor as we
[36:31] see that day approaching
[36:33] amen we need to buckle it up and just
[36:35] get ready and so
[36:37] amen this morning it's i'll tell you
[36:38] this morning's message it's just
[36:40] something i
[36:41] uh i don't know why but i truly believe
[36:43] that the holy spirit is leading us in a
[36:45] direction
[36:46] uh towards his coming amen
[36:50] i believe his coming is real soon i
[36:52] believe it's real close at hand
[36:54] amen and i mean we're talking about
[36:58] something major unlike anything we've
[37:00] ever seen amen
[37:02] and so we want to dwell on that this
[37:04] morning and as i begin to study and
[37:07] pray just what the lord want to have me
[37:08] to say and
[37:10] the quotes and the scriptures that i
[37:12] want to read and so forth
[37:14] i know that with what we have here i
[37:16] just pray that the lord
[37:17] just help me to get out of the way that
[37:18] he can use me to say what needs to be
[37:21] said and
[37:22] may his presence come down anoint the
[37:24] words amen
[37:25] anoint every heart to receive the word
[37:28] how he believes that's how it works
[37:30] amen that we might go from here better
[37:32] people than what we've come
[37:34] because we do believe that god has sent
[37:36] a fivefold ministry for the perfecting
[37:38] of the saints
[37:39] for the working of the ministry for the
[37:41] edifying of the body of christ
[37:43] amen and so a minister has to be out of
[37:45] the way that god can use and we desire
[37:47] that god will just do that
[37:49] amen in a special way so amen i know
[37:52] it's simply tremendous amen and
[37:56] i don't know if i yes i'll just i'll
[37:58] just say it the way that
[38:00] the prophet described it he says you
[38:02] know the responsibility
[38:04] that god has given us in this day to
[38:06] bring this message
[38:08] amen that's something i i had this quote
[38:11] wrote down but i thought just
[38:12] you know this is the way i feel and i
[38:14] believe the prophet felt this way too
[38:16] as ministers and as i get older amen
[38:19] and i know my days are shortening up i
[38:21] feel the responsibility greater than i
[38:24] ever have felt to press it on we must do
[38:28] it we must get down to
[38:30] in and everywhere and go out and tell
[38:33] the message
[38:34] tell the people that jesus christ is
[38:36] coming amen
[38:38] felt it greater than ever back then how
[38:40] much more do you think it's important
[38:42] this morning
[38:43] amen and he's coming soon
[38:46] amen that's right and there's not a
[38:49] hope left in the world but the coming of
[38:53] the lord
[38:54] not a hope left in the world but the
[38:56] coming of the lord and so that's what
[38:58] we're going to focus on
[38:59] amen you know as long as the lord wants
[39:02] but especially this morning on
[39:04] on beginning ready for the coming of the
[39:06] lord i believe it's time to be ready
[39:08] for his coming amen i truly believe that
[39:11] god has sent malachi 4 to dress
[39:13] and to get us ready for his coming amen
[39:16] let's bow our heads and pray
[39:18] father we come before you lord jesus
[39:20] once again this morning lord assembling
[39:22] ourselves together
[39:23] a solemn assembly lord jesus knowing god
[39:25] that this is what you have ordained
[39:27] father that we would assemble ourselves
[39:29] together and that we would open your
[39:30] word father and
[39:31] you would speak to our hearts we asked
[39:34] god this morning that you would help me
[39:35] lord jesus just to get out of the way
[39:37] even as your prophet did lord jesus you
[39:40] spoke through the spirit through him
[39:42] father the words that we have needed to
[39:43] hear father we ask god to do the same
[39:46] again for we know that you're not dead
[39:48] but you're alive and remain the same
[39:50] forever lord
[39:51] we ask god that you just bless the
[39:53] meditation of our heart and that which
[39:55] we feel
[39:56] you've laid upon our hearts to speak on
[39:57] father about the tremendous
[40:00] and the great responsibility and the
[40:02] tremendous thought father of you coming
[40:04] lord jesus
[40:06] and how that you're going to have a
[40:07] church that's without spot without a
[40:09] wrinkle or any such thing
[40:11] that we would be holding without blemish
[40:13] at your common lord
[40:14] we just ask god that you'll just bless
[40:16] the reading of the word now as we open
[40:18] the bible
[40:19] and as we set our hearts and our minds
[40:21] completely on you lord
[40:22] and lord we erase and we shut out
[40:24] everything in every care of this world
[40:26] father and we want to ask god to help us
[40:29] to completely get shut in with you lord
[40:31] this morning
[40:32] and that you would speak to us lord
[40:33] jesus walk and talk with us
[40:35] along the way for we ask it in the name
[40:37] of jesus christ
[40:39] amen and amen amen let's just go to
[40:44] matthew if you will the 25th chapter
[40:48] amen and i'm going to have to take my
[40:50] ink pen if i have one here
[40:52] i guess i don't amen but i'm gonna have
[40:55] to
[40:56] i mean if somebody got an ink pen amen i
[40:59] want to try to
[41:01] try to stay
[41:04] straight on this as i can amen thank you
[41:07] brother david
[41:08] praise the lord matthew 25
[41:12] amen matthew 25.
[41:19] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[41:21] enlightened unto ten virgins
[41:25] which took their lamps and went forth to
[41:28] meet the bridegroom
[41:30] and five of them were wise and five were
[41:33] foolish
[41:34] they that were foolish took their lamps
[41:37] and took no oil with them but the wise
[41:40] took oil in their vessels
[41:42] with their lamps and while the
[41:44] bridegroom tarried
[41:45] they all slumbered and slept and at
[41:48] midnight there was a cry made amen
[41:50] knows we believe that truly we've heard
[41:52] the midnight cry
[41:54] we have made heard the midnight cry
[41:56] through malachi 4.
[41:58] behold the bridegroom cometh go
[42:01] ye out to meet him and those 10 virgins
[42:05] arose and trimmed their lamps and the
[42:08] foolish virgins said unto the wise give
[42:10] us of your oil for our lamps are going
[42:12] out
[42:12] but the wise ants are saying not so
[42:15] least there be not enough for us
[42:16] and you but go ye rather to them that
[42:20] sell
[42:21] and buy for yourselves and while they
[42:22] went to buy
[42:24] the bridegroom came and they that were
[42:27] ready went in with him to the marriage
[42:29] and the door
[42:30] was shut afterwards came also the other
[42:33] virgin saying lord lord open to us
[42:36] but he answered and said verily i say
[42:38] unto you
[42:39] i know you not watch therefore
[42:42] for ye know neither the day nor the hour
[42:45] when the son of man
[42:46] cometh amen may god at this blessing
[42:48] said reading of the words you can be
[42:50] seated this morning
[42:53] amen you know this
[42:56] was a parable that jesus spoke and that
[42:58] he uh
[42:59] gave just after he gave the parable of
[43:03] the fig tree
[43:04] and he gave us the example as that it
[43:06] would be like it was in the days of noah
[43:09] that people were eating and drinking
[43:10] marrying and giving in marriage
[43:12] until the day that noah
[43:16] entered into the ark amen
[43:19] you know there are so many different
[43:20] aspects of the coming of the lord
[43:23] one of them is we know that the prophet
[43:25] taught us that
[43:27] jesus's final ministry and the people
[43:29] that he preached to
[43:30] last was to the total lost
[43:34] amen he went down to the regions of the
[43:36] lost and preached to the souls that were
[43:38] in prison
[43:39] how many remember brother barron
[43:41] preaching a message called souls in
[43:42] prison
[43:43] now amen and he wondered even the
[43:46] prophet of god if you listen that he
[43:48] wondered
[43:49] whether he was preaching to the souls
[43:51] that were in prison
[43:52] even there that he was preaching to the
[43:54] total laws he says could it be friends
[43:56] could it be
[43:58] and think of how long ago that was
[44:02] amen but we realize that there will come
[44:04] a time and
[44:05] the scripture for is found in
[44:07] revelations
[44:08] amen all the way at the last chapter it
[44:10] talks about
[44:12] amen he says let him that's holy be holy
[44:14] still
[44:15] that's him that's unjust beyond just
[44:17] still let's him that's filthy be filthy
[44:20] still
[44:21] so there's coming a time when people are
[44:23] going to be
[44:24] what they are amen how many believes
[44:28] this morning amen now is the time to
[44:31] prepare
[44:32] amen one of these wouldn't it be
[44:33] something that if you got stuck
[44:35] right in the condition that you're in
[44:37] right now
[44:41] be a terrible thing amen if you're not
[44:43] completely in christ
[44:45] amen amen
[44:49] we're living in an age and our brothers
[44:51] and sisters when we look around and we
[44:53] see
[44:54] both in the political realm and in the
[44:56] whole world realm and especially
[44:58] especially in our own nation we see
[45:01] how that gross darkness that the prophet
[45:03] god talked about
[45:04] but it is getting darker and darker
[45:08] and darker amen
[45:11] and isaiah as you know in isaiah uh
[45:14] you know we find in isaiah 60 how it
[45:18] says there
[45:19] it says arise and shine for thy light is
[45:22] come
[45:22] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[45:26] thee
[45:28] i truly believe that the glory of the
[45:30] lord rose upon this generation
[45:33] it rose upon those who did hear the
[45:36] midnight
[45:37] cry and came out how many believes you
[45:41] got to come out god
[45:42] calls for people to come out
[45:46] go out to meet him
[45:49] what was we called out of we were called
[45:51] out of
[45:52] man-made denominations man-made systems
[45:57] because all that's all that most
[45:58] churches are they're man-made systems
[46:02] and then especially i mean you can look
[46:04] and you can look amongst the amish and
[46:07] the mennonite and some of them are
[46:08] allowed steel wheels on their tractors
[46:11] some of them
[46:11] can't have rubber tires and oh my
[46:14] there's so many different
[46:15] everybody's just putting their own
[46:17] interpretation to the word of god
[46:19] and the bible says come out of all of
[46:21] that
[46:22] and if we come out of that we come out
[46:24] of whether it's baptist methodist
[46:26] presbyterian he says come out
[46:28] of her my people how many beings we got
[46:31] there's a time there's a calling out
[46:33] that's taking place
[46:35] god is calling us out amen
[46:39] and what is he calling us out to do
[46:44] to meet him go ye
[46:47] out to meet him
[46:51] why that shows that he's outside he's
[46:54] out there somewhere amen
[46:58] praise the lord like i said there's a
[47:00] lot but i'm just going to try to follow
[47:02] the spirit the best i can is that okay
[47:08] after these things i saw an angel angel
[47:10] come down from heaven having great power
[47:12] and the earth was lightened
[47:14] with his glory and he cried mightily
[47:16] with his strong voice
[47:19] amen babylon the great is fallen and
[47:22] it's fallen and it's become the
[47:23] habitation of devils
[47:25] and the hold of every foul spirit in the
[47:28] clay
[47:28] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[47:31] bird
[47:32] but a man says that's the churches
[47:36] brother why are you always talking about
[47:38] the churches well you always talk about
[47:40] churches
[47:42] brother brahm says the most lethal the
[47:44] most led
[47:45] deadly and the most deceiving thing
[47:48] upon the face of the earth is a church
[47:51] that's not right with god
[47:57] it's more lethal than anything you can
[47:58] know because look at all the people that
[48:00] goes there
[48:01] and they get taught false doctrine and
[48:04] are deceived
[48:06] amen just up here in town talk to my
[48:09] banker and they were going to have to
[48:11] take a vote on whether they're going to
[48:12] allow homosexuality
[48:14] preachers that's how bad
[48:18] and hateful and unclean it has gotten
[48:21] right go back and listen to what the
[48:24] problem said
[48:25] what he where he was going with it amen
[48:27] i believe it was in the invisible union
[48:29] of christ in the bride
[48:30] and he talked about how that a woman
[48:32] right a female
[48:34] woman had the devil used eve in that
[48:36] right
[48:37] to bring down the whole creation he
[48:39] brought death through eve
[48:41] eve is a type of the church he said and
[48:43] that church
[48:44] that gets out of his place is the most
[48:47] deceiving thing upon the face of the
[48:49] earth
[48:50] that's why it's so important
[48:53] about what church you go to
[48:58] because you're going to believe what
[48:59] they say isn't that right and you're
[49:02] either going to be saved through that or
[49:04] deceived by
[49:04] what is taught amen
[49:08] so that's why i always talk about this
[49:10] because you know and
[49:12] you didn't have to back in the 50s or
[49:13] the 60s when brother braham says that
[49:15] even pentecost is dead
[49:17] that they have went into the mark of the
[49:19] beast amen
[49:21] way back then you wouldn't have thought
[49:23] but guess what everything has taken
[49:26] its course it's running its course
[49:30] and it's showing how wicked and evil
[49:33] and unclean it really is
[49:37] amen in the world that we're living in
[49:41] we're seeing it especially in our
[49:42] politics how that amen
[49:44] the whole world even people amen that
[49:46] are you know out there
[49:48] even they are no they know that
[49:50] everything
[49:51] that is is being completely flipped
[49:54] around
[49:55] i read wednesday night i believe it was
[49:57] how that the devil's
[49:59] whole kingdom his whole
[50:02] ambition is to destroy
[50:05] god's kingdom the devil fights
[50:08] everything that's godly everything
[50:10] that's right
[50:12] he fights it and now we're at a place
[50:16] where everything that is right is called
[50:18] wrong
[50:19] amen and everything that is wrong
[50:22] is called right
[50:26] see that it shows how powerful the devil
[50:29] is getting
[50:30] and not only that but it'll get so bad
[50:33] and i was thinking about this
[50:34] how bad is god going to let this get
[50:40] how many knows it's going to get worse
[50:41] because in 57 but the bible says not
[50:43] there ain't no hope for america
[50:44] she's going to go down get down down
[50:46] down
[50:48] and every one of us have been involved
[50:50] in the political spectrum
[50:51] a lot of people have been involved in
[50:53] this people in the political spectrum
[50:55] i have been involved in the political
[50:58] spectrum because
[50:59] i truly believe that what we're seeing
[51:01] hello
[51:03] is the last of the good things going
[51:06] away
[51:08] and it grips us it affects us it affects
[51:10] a lot of message people to see
[51:12] the last of it going away
[51:16] and we're seeing that total darkness
[51:18] coming in like a flood
[51:19] amen it could get so so much until if
[51:22] you don't acknowledge and so forth and
[51:24] take part
[51:25] part of their evil they want to
[51:28] persecute you
[51:29] and they're right and not only will but
[51:32] look look at how bad
[51:33] sodom had gotten before god destroyed
[51:36] them
[51:36] when those men came down there those
[51:38] angels came down into sodom
[51:41] and man to get blood out and so forth
[51:43] remember that they almost
[51:44] beat lot's door down and they didn't
[51:47] want his daughters
[51:48] we want those men and we want to know
[51:50] those men
[51:53] that's how evil it has gotten amen so
[51:56] it's going to probably go a little
[51:57] further it's going to get even more evil
[51:59] because the sin of the amalekites and so
[52:02] forth that sin
[52:03] the cup of iniquity has to get
[52:05] completely full
[52:08] because god is going to get it let it
[52:10] get really really really wicked
[52:13] and i got to thinking of how that you
[52:15] know it is time you know and i believe
[52:17] for
[52:17] us as believers for the first place we
[52:19] knew that it wasn't going to turn around
[52:22] and i told my wife don't let that bother
[52:24] you don't think about that
[52:26] it's not supposed to get better no
[52:28] matter how much you think this might go
[52:30] by
[52:30] we could go this way we could get no no
[52:32] it's not supposed to get better
[52:35] there's nothing but judgment proclaimed
[52:37] upon our nation and this whole world
[52:40] not just this nation but upon the whole
[52:42] world
[52:44] this just comes to mind but is that okay
[52:46] amen there ain't no telling me amen it
[52:48] would just take a day or two
[52:50] for the stark market to crash
[52:53] and that great recession that the
[52:55] prophet of god talked about he says
[52:56] there are coming recession unlike you've
[52:58] ever seen
[52:58] amen everybody forfeit all of their
[53:00] rights just to have something to eat
[53:03] and then unless you belong to them and
[53:05] do what they want
[53:06] you to do you won't be able to buy or
[53:08] sell
[53:10] those scriptures could come into play so
[53:11] easily
[53:13] and it could happen any day
[53:17] amen
[53:20] so it's pl it's certainly time for
[53:22] everybody to get their eyes on jesus
[53:26] turn your eyes upon jesus look full upon
[53:28] his wonderful face
[53:29] amen and all the things of this earth
[53:31] will go strangely them as you look at
[53:33] the
[53:34] into the light of his glory and grace
[53:37] amen
[53:37] so we see this darkness there is
[53:39] darkness that's coming upon the earth
[53:41] it means it is so dark until it may grow
[53:44] starkness upon the people
[53:47] the course the direction that the world
[53:49] is going
[53:50] and the word direction that you're going
[53:52] is completely opposite
[53:55] how many beliefs even us as a church we
[53:57] as a group i mean it's important that
[54:00] every individual knows that hey i'm
[54:02] heading in a certain direction
[54:03] don't just sit at a place where i don't
[54:06] really know which direction
[54:07] amen you need to know which direction
[54:08] that you're going
[54:11] because the direction that we're going
[54:12] is not the flip make right wrong and
[54:14] wrong right
[54:15] we're like the prophet god says it's
[54:17] time to call black black
[54:19] and white white how many believe that
[54:23] it is time that we line up with this
[54:25] word 100
[54:27] that's the direction that we want to go
[54:30] amen that we are going have been going
[54:33] and we'll go
[54:36] less of ourselves and more of him
[54:41] my message this morning is letting him
[54:45] live 20 21
[54:49] letting him live
[54:53] amen all the songs went along with it
[54:55] amen
[54:57] that's right letting him live
[55:01] we're going to look with the help of the
[55:02] lord amen what is it going to take
[55:05] what's it going to take well don't we
[55:06] all want to know what it's going to take
[55:09] because we're talking about something
[55:11] here that the bible talked about
[55:14] jesus talked about brother bam says he
[55:16] spoke more of the second commentators
[55:18] first when he was going out of this
[55:20] world
[55:20] he began to talk more about his second
[55:22] coming and i believe that you and i are
[55:24] going to
[55:24] see that second coming two things are
[55:27] going to
[55:27] let me just say this again i've said it
[55:29] before two things is going to happen in
[55:30] your life
[55:32] you're either going to go in the rapture
[55:34] or you're going to get left behind
[55:37] you're going to stay right here and
[55:39] you're going to fulfill that prophecy
[55:41] the prophet of god made
[55:42] when he says you know their time will
[55:44] come when people will say well wasn't
[55:46] there supposed to be a rapture
[55:49] look how bad it is look at how it is
[55:51] wasn't that supposed to be a rapture
[55:54] and that voice will sound back he says
[55:56] it's already happened
[55:59] and you missed it
[56:02] amen two directions
[56:05] two places we're going to end up at
[56:07] we're going to
[56:08] end up in the body change moment in the
[56:11] twinkling of an eye
[56:12] or we're going to be left behind
[56:16] left behind what a terrible thought
[56:20] of being left behind
[56:25] how bad will it get how long will jesus
[56:26] let it go jesus let it go so bad
[56:29] he let it get so dark in the days of
[56:32] noah
[56:33] that out of the whole world only eight
[56:37] people were saved only eight
[56:41] jesus says when i come back to the earth
[56:44] will i even find any faith
[56:50] will i even find any faith
[56:54] and i think anybody of any of us knows
[56:56] that knows the message of this hour
[56:57] knows brother branham
[56:59] narrowed it way down to just a few
[57:05] amen few that make it
[57:10] that's why this morning that's why i
[57:11] tremble that's why i shaken myself god
[57:15] if it's just going to be few lord help
[57:18] me to be ready i want to be ready
[57:22] because i'm going to tell you right now
[57:24] you know
[57:25] as we go down into this and as we get
[57:27] closer to and when we come down to that
[57:28] place you remember
[57:30] one of these days it isn't going to
[57:32] matter
[57:33] that about how much money you make how
[57:36] many you've made or what you've done in
[57:38] this world
[57:38] it won't mean anything
[57:45] let's not wait until it becomes no good
[57:48] our money is no good anymore before we
[57:50] decide well what did i do for the
[57:51] kingdom of god what did i do for the
[57:54] lord
[57:56] how did i live for that's the only thing
[57:58] that matters isn't that right
[58:00] it's how that you live for the lord
[58:04] the only thing that matters amen
[58:08] praise the lord
[58:13] oh yeah so we want to look
[58:17] with the help of the lord we want to
[58:19] look
[58:21] and what it's going to take to be there
[58:24] because truly like i said i i want
[58:27] everybody here i want everybody i'm
[58:29] going to work on i'm going to try to
[58:30] make
[58:31] try to get get everything ever do all i
[58:33] don't want nobody's blood on my hands
[58:36] i want to do everything that i can i
[58:38] want to be right and i want every one of
[58:39] you to make
[58:40] me to make it also i know that's not in
[58:44] my hand but my job and what i am to do
[58:46] as a minister of the gospel
[58:48] amen is to try to bring us to perfection
[58:51] remember what i preached the other
[58:52] sunday and about perfection
[58:55] amen how that god requires it
[58:58] i mean how god it requires that token
[59:00] and he requires
[59:02] amen that we stand right and just before
[59:04] god and
[59:05] amen he says where can i take you to the
[59:06] branham tiger and here's as filthy and
[59:08] dirty as the rest of them are
[59:10] there's only one place that god will
[59:12] meet you only one place god will accept
[59:14] you
[59:15] and that is in christ jesus it's the
[59:18] only safe place
[59:20] amen all right
[59:24] that's right there is not one
[59:28] glimpse of hope of this world surviving
[59:32] no i mean it is going down
[59:37] let me say it this way this is what i
[59:39] thought of when i come up with
[59:40] now to come up with but i felt like when
[59:42] the lord laid this on my heart
[59:44] it's like there's this big boat perhaps
[59:46] like hawaii
[59:47] perhaps there's this big ship amen that
[59:49] is docked
[59:50] but guess what hawaii is beginning to
[59:53] rock hawaii is beginning to shake
[59:55] and every scientist says that it would
[59:57] be a matter of time that that whole
[59:58] island is going to go down and
[1:00:00] everybody's coming out of the mountains
[1:00:01] everybody's coming out
[1:00:02] everywhere because that boat is fixing
[1:00:05] to leave and anybody that's on the boat
[1:00:06] is the only one that's going to survive
[1:00:08] i call it the old gospel ship it's time
[1:00:11] to get on board
[1:00:13] get on board the world's going down
[1:00:16] and the only thing that's going to
[1:00:18] survive it is the lord jesus christ
[1:00:20] that's where you and i stand today we
[1:00:23] didn't get to experience world war
[1:00:25] ii we don't know what it's like to have
[1:00:27] all of that chaos and all of that
[1:00:29] all of that but listen you are going to
[1:00:31] experience
[1:00:33] the end of the world if you stay here
[1:00:37] you're going to know what the
[1:00:38] tribulation period is like
[1:00:41] if you're not ready the bible says
[1:00:44] be ready how many places it's time to
[1:00:46] get ready i believe it's more relevant
[1:00:48] now i see that we
[1:00:49] get ready praise the lord
[1:00:52] how many believes there's a countdown
[1:00:54] that's right god is counting it down
[1:00:56] amen through seven church ages count
[1:00:58] down
[1:00:58] amen we got four stages of getting ready
[1:01:00] one of them was justification
[1:01:03] how many thank god for justification
[1:01:06] luther came out and he believed that you
[1:01:08] got to be justified prophet god preached
[1:01:10] it and he made it so justified
[1:01:12] it's as though you've never done it in
[1:01:14] the first place
[1:01:15] god has to do a work we're justified and
[1:01:17] they were sanctified
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:20] praise the lord oh my i thought that
[1:01:23] maybe
[1:01:24] we need to preach a message of wesley
[1:01:26] preach a little of wesley because people
[1:01:28] i want you to know something
[1:01:30] we got to be sanctified god has to have
[1:01:33] this heart clean
[1:01:37] without holiness see how you see god
[1:01:41] no man shall see god without holiness
[1:01:47] amen a holy person what'll they do
[1:01:51] they'll dress right they'll look right
[1:01:54] they won't wear any more clothes they'll
[1:01:56] do all of that but a person that's
[1:01:58] unholy a lot of times does the same
[1:02:00] thing
[1:02:00] it's not your dress that makes you holy
[1:02:03] you dress right because you are holy
[1:02:05] people can dress right and do all of
[1:02:07] that and still
[1:02:08] not be holy that's not the kind of
[1:02:09] sanctification i'm talking about
[1:02:11] i'm talking about the blood of jesus
[1:02:13] christ coming down in your heart
[1:02:15] and cleansing you from all sin
[1:02:20] god is not going to take you into into
[1:02:22] heaven all dirty and
[1:02:23] mired up in sin and unbelief not going
[1:02:26] to take it
[1:02:28] how many of us are going to bless oh my
[1:02:31] brings me to another scripture i've got
[1:02:33] a whole
[1:02:34] list of scriptures here that i want to
[1:02:36] first of all
[1:02:37] go through with you on those that aren't
[1:02:39] going to be there
[1:02:42] people that won't be there people that
[1:02:45] will be disappointed
[1:02:49] you want to take a little trip with me
[1:02:52] let's go to
[1:03:00] matthew
[1:03:09] let's go to matthew 8.
[1:03:17] i was thinking how that
[1:03:21] how many believes that the holy spirit
[1:03:22] causes you to search
[1:03:24] your soul
[1:03:27] it causes you to search yourself
[1:03:32] i believe in philippians before we read
[1:03:35] this one i'm going to read you this one
[1:03:40] paul says wherefore my beloved as he
[1:03:43] have always obeyed
[1:03:44] not as in my presence only is
[1:03:47] philippians 2 verse 12.
[1:03:49] but now much more in my absence work
[1:03:52] out your own salvation with
[1:03:55] fear and trembling
[1:04:01] amen another place it says
[1:04:06] see if you be in the faith or not
[1:04:11] because i want you to know something
[1:04:14] i want to tell you something there's
[1:04:16] going to be
[1:04:17] billions and billions
[1:04:21] of christians so-called
[1:04:24] that deceive themselves
[1:04:28] and they're going to be disappointed on
[1:04:30] that day
[1:04:34] how many believes you as a christian
[1:04:35] that's not something i'm looking for i'm
[1:04:37] not looking for to come to that place
[1:04:39] and be disappointed
[1:04:43] i thought of that scripture where there
[1:04:45] was two uh that went to the uh
[1:04:47] temple to pray right and there was the
[1:04:50] pharisee or there was this one that said
[1:04:52] lord i thank you that you haven't made
[1:04:54] me like this man that i'm not a sinner
[1:04:56] and that i'm
[1:04:56] paying my arms and i do this and i do
[1:04:59] that and i thank you lord that you
[1:05:00] didn't make me like everybody else
[1:05:04] and then there was the other guy beating
[1:05:05] himself in the chest oh god forgive me
[1:05:08] all right and sinner
[1:05:09] huh lord forgive me and what did jesus
[1:05:13] say
[1:05:13] that guy's gonna get something right
[1:05:14] there
[1:05:16] he recognized
[1:05:20] how he was and i don't care
[1:05:23] how much of a christian you are look at
[1:05:26] all the times that even the prophet of
[1:05:28] god said forgive
[1:05:29] your unworthy servant
[1:05:34] unworthy servant
[1:05:38] and i believe that when you're a
[1:05:39] christian that holy spirit causes you to
[1:05:42] search your heart
[1:05:43] and realize hey when i look at myself
[1:05:45] and i say lord
[1:05:46] what am i doing i'm almost 60 years old
[1:05:48] what have i done for the lord
[1:05:50] look at the opportunities that i've
[1:05:52] missed to witness to people
[1:05:55] didn't say he says if you're not
[1:05:56] witnessing to people if you're not
[1:05:58] getting people to christ
[1:05:59] you have failed you have failed if you
[1:06:03] haven't bring bought people to christ
[1:06:06] amen and it makes you realize
[1:06:09] it makes you see your own fault and
[1:06:12] where you're not where you ought to be
[1:06:15] and it helps you to actually get closer
[1:06:17] to god you can humble yourself and
[1:06:19] realize
[1:06:19] because i'll tell you what when you
[1:06:20] really look at yourself you realize god
[1:06:23] i am really not worthy i don't know why
[1:06:26] you even have me preach lord but
[1:06:28] you know i don't feel worthy
[1:06:31] but this one i think i do lord is repent
[1:06:33] of my sin if i know i have any
[1:06:35] show me where i'm wrong lord i want to
[1:06:37] be right how many is with me this
[1:06:39] morning
[1:06:39] show me where i'm wrong lord i want to
[1:06:42] be right because this isn't going to
[1:06:44] matter
[1:06:44] about anybody else it's going to matter
[1:06:46] about you
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:48] it isn't going to matter about your
[1:06:49] husband and it's not going to matter
[1:06:51] about your wife according to the bible
[1:06:53] one will be in the bed and one will be
[1:06:55] left and one will be taken
[1:06:56] your wife may not be going brother
[1:07:01] sister your husband may not be going
[1:07:04] hello it's important that you in your
[1:07:07] heart say god
[1:07:08] do i know without a shadow of a doubt
[1:07:10] that i'm living the way i don't live
[1:07:13] that i have what i'm supposed to have to
[1:07:15] make this rapture
[1:07:16] that was brother branham's entire goal
[1:07:18] that was his ambition was to get people
[1:07:20] not just the church
[1:07:21] but to get him to christ and to get you
[1:07:23] and i ready
[1:07:26] how many believes that to meet him
[1:07:29] he didn't point like this he pointed up
[1:07:33] he pointed us to christ
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:40] first disappointment and i say this
[1:07:44] about deceiving themselves because even
[1:07:45] jesus said
[1:07:47] he said by their fruits you shall know
[1:07:49] them can i say this by your fruits you
[1:07:51] can know
[1:07:53] amen check your own tree see how the
[1:07:56] fruit's growing
[1:07:57] see how much love is there see if you
[1:08:00] have a passion for the lost
[1:08:02] see if you have a lot a passion for the
[1:08:04] lord see how much you love
[1:08:06] god see how much you love church
[1:08:10] then brother baby says if god is in your
[1:08:12] heart you can't wait for them doors to
[1:08:14] open
[1:08:15] and to get in there and to worship the
[1:08:17] lord and to
[1:08:18] fellowship around the word of god and
[1:08:20] fellowship with your brothers and
[1:08:21] sisters
[1:08:22] that's the holy ghost it makes you reach
[1:08:24] out to others
[1:08:26] they said you can't hardly chain them
[1:08:27] doors shut you want to get in
[1:08:30] ah let me let me in
[1:08:33] that person's in love with god i mean i
[1:08:36] believe it takes sincerity
[1:08:37] it's going to take more sincerity for us
[1:08:39] and it's going to take more prayer
[1:08:41] and it's going to take a much greater
[1:08:42] dedication out of every last one of us
[1:08:44] in 2021.
[1:08:47] we're way down the road how many knows
[1:08:49] that every one of us
[1:08:50] we need a greater dedication and a more
[1:08:52] sincere walk with god
[1:08:55] we need to get our eyes more off the
[1:08:56] things of the world and more on a god
[1:08:59] and i've got a quote direct quote from
[1:09:00] the prophet says telling us that
[1:09:04] not everyone that sayeth unto me lord
[1:09:06] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:09:08] heaven but he that doeth the will
[1:09:10] of my father which is in heaven
[1:09:14] many will say to me in that lord lord
[1:09:16] haven't we prophesied in thy name
[1:09:18] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[1:09:21] thy name
[1:09:22] done many mighty works
[1:09:27] these people cast out devils perhaps
[1:09:29] maybe
[1:09:31] all kinds of things happen but yet still
[1:09:33] didn't make
[1:09:34] it you know why
[1:09:38] i'll tell you why because they didn't
[1:09:40] look deep enough
[1:09:43] they didn't look deep enough
[1:09:51] because what did the lord say depart for
[1:09:54] me that
[1:09:55] work iniquity you still knew that you
[1:09:58] wasn't right in other places
[1:10:02] huh you knew there was places in your
[1:10:05] heart
[1:10:05] in your life that you wasn't right
[1:10:09] and you ignored those places
[1:10:14] those kind of people is going to be left
[1:10:15] outside
[1:10:17] amen i believe it's so
[1:10:20] searching time it's heart searching time
[1:10:28] listening to the prophet of god this
[1:10:29] week he say makes a statement with
[1:10:31] abraham
[1:10:32] that he took lot with him he took his
[1:10:34] dad with him
[1:10:36] right when god when god says leave your
[1:10:37] kindred leave your family leave every
[1:10:39] last one
[1:10:40] leave them all you and sarah y'all come
[1:10:42] out that's what i'm calling
[1:10:44] and he brought a bunch and we had all
[1:10:45] kinds of problems
[1:10:48] but the problem the point was not until
[1:10:50] he separated from those people that god
[1:10:52] had told him
[1:10:53] to separate did god ever fully bless him
[1:10:57] and brother man makes a statement he
[1:10:58] says know this
[1:11:00] know this that we will never you will
[1:11:03] ever
[1:11:04] be fully blessed until you fully obey
[1:11:08] what god said do
[1:11:15] you'll never be fully blessed until you
[1:11:17] do what god said
[1:11:19] do
[1:11:23] how many needs improvement
[1:11:27] huh i don't think any hand could hardly
[1:11:29] go up
[1:11:30] that stay down it's not to know that you
[1:11:32] are somewhere where you can do a little
[1:11:34] better than what you're doing
[1:11:38] that's not what saves you your works
[1:11:41] don't save you
[1:11:43] no but what you do when you have that
[1:11:45] desire it shows there's something down
[1:11:47] there
[1:11:47] and that you love the lord is that right
[1:11:51] shows he's done the work for you and
[1:11:53] what you do
[1:11:54] is in love and appreciation to him
[1:11:57] amen oh how we need to love the lord
[1:12:01] more
[1:12:07] the most greatest
[1:12:11] event ever
[1:12:15] is the rapture because how many knows
[1:12:17] that's also the resurrection
[1:12:21] god's been waiting for it for 6 000
[1:12:23] years he's been waiting for that time
[1:12:26] the biggest thing that ever happened is
[1:12:27] going to happen you say well calvary was
[1:12:29] it
[1:12:31] calvary went and bought something
[1:12:34] all right calvary repaid for something i
[1:12:36] don't know about when you when i pay for
[1:12:37] something brother jeff
[1:12:38] i like to go get what i paid for
[1:12:41] i ain't fully happy until i get what i
[1:12:43] paid for
[1:12:45] how many likes to get what you pay for
[1:12:47] well that's when jesus comes for the
[1:12:48] purchased procession according to
[1:12:50] ephesians 1.
[1:12:52] rapture is when he comes and possesses
[1:12:55] that which has been purchased
[1:13:00] do you realize how long god's been
[1:13:02] waiting to be with you
[1:13:05] you know how long god has been waiting
[1:13:07] for those that brother brown seen in
[1:13:09] that other dimension millions of people
[1:13:11] that believe the message that god sent
[1:13:13] in this hour and all of those converts
[1:13:15] millions of them there they don't even
[1:13:18] see jesus
[1:13:21] they're under the altar because remember
[1:13:24] when brother bannon was translated 20
[1:13:26] foot up there and he's seen all that and
[1:13:27] he says well i want to see my lord
[1:13:30] i want to see jesus he says you can't
[1:13:32] see him yet he's still a little higher
[1:13:34] and you'll have to wait
[1:13:36] because we're going when we get to see
[1:13:37] him we're all going to get to see him
[1:13:38] together
[1:13:40] how many believes that that's the truth
[1:13:44] amen and so the lord god has been
[1:13:46] waiting for this moment that lays ahead
[1:13:48] of us
[1:13:50] amen i'm gonna say like the prophet of
[1:13:53] god said
[1:13:55] and that is what's laying a hit for the
[1:13:58] unbeliever is a horrible thing that you
[1:14:00] could ever
[1:14:01] imagine
[1:14:04] and for the believer
[1:14:09] come on folks it's not just well it'll
[1:14:11] be pretty good no
[1:14:12] it's awesome it's going to be the
[1:14:14] greatest thing ever
[1:14:15] more than you can ever imagine
[1:14:19] lays ahead for the believer for those
[1:14:21] who love god the greatest time
[1:14:24] lays ahead the horriblest time lays
[1:14:27] ahead for the
[1:14:28] unbeliever but the greatest time lays
[1:14:31] ahead for the believer
[1:14:34] oh aren't you glad listen even jesus
[1:14:36] said the key thief
[1:14:38] he don't come but to kill to steal and
[1:14:41] destroy
[1:14:42] you know the devil is nothing but a
[1:14:44] perverter
[1:14:45] he perverts everything he's the one that
[1:14:49] perverted the original word to eve thou
[1:14:51] shalt not surely die
[1:14:54] he perverted he's an absolute pervert
[1:14:59] amen what do you think we used to call
[1:15:02] people that
[1:15:03] were of a different sex like that
[1:15:05] perverts because that's what they are
[1:15:06] they're perverts
[1:15:10] huh
[1:15:13] living in the world will get you shot
[1:15:14] for saying stuff like that
[1:15:17] yes you'll just have to shoot me because
[1:15:18] i'm gonna tell the truth
[1:15:20] you're not going to heaven god don't god
[1:15:22] don't sanction that he loves you
[1:15:24] but he don't love your sin he don't
[1:15:26] condone
[1:15:27] your sin and you'll never force that
[1:15:29] upon a believer either
[1:15:31] i would rather die than to be forced
[1:15:32] upon like without such a thing as that
[1:15:35] that's exactly what they're trying to
[1:15:36] force the devil's trying to force you're
[1:15:38] looking at
[1:15:39] the manifestation of the devil trying to
[1:15:41] force a market a beast
[1:15:42] and force people into evil it's an
[1:15:45] absolute truth
[1:15:46] that the devil is fighting the kingdom
[1:15:48] of heaven you know right
[1:15:49] all the way to the end and this is all
[1:15:51] about he doesn't the devil doesn't care
[1:15:53] about how much chaos the world is in
[1:15:55] do you think that the devil's going to
[1:15:56] take over and everything's everything's
[1:15:59] going to run smoothly after that
[1:16:00] he's got what no it's going to be total
[1:16:03] chaos
[1:16:04] because that's what the devil always
[1:16:05] brings his total chaos
[1:16:07] and ruins of nations
[1:16:10] the only thing he cares about is that
[1:16:12] people come to his side
[1:16:14] and go to hell with him that's what he
[1:16:16] wants he wants to take as many to hell
[1:16:18] with him
[1:16:18] as he can but he can't have you
[1:16:22] and he can't have me
[1:16:26] but it's time folks it's the time
[1:16:34] oh yes
[1:16:45] amen i believe the time has come don't
[1:16:47] you
[1:16:48] that we quit playing church that we get
[1:16:51] ready
[1:16:53] there can't be any put on it's got to be
[1:16:55] real
[1:16:56] what's down here has got to be real amen
[1:17:01] okay so
[1:17:05] maybe another scripture on this before
[1:17:06] we go into what it's going to take to be
[1:17:08] ready
[1:17:11] um let's go to
[1:17:14] matthew 13
[1:17:24] i just feel the solemnness of the hour
[1:17:26] don't you
[1:17:28] i just feel like something could happen
[1:17:30] anytime
[1:17:34] i feel like it's the holy spirit for one
[1:17:36] thing in me
[1:17:37] calling out and it should be a rebound
[1:17:40] in every believer
[1:17:42] that it's time to be ready it's time to
[1:17:45] lay all foolishness aside
[1:17:49] how many believes that there's going to
[1:17:51] be outer darkness
[1:17:53] where there will be weeping and wailing
[1:17:56] and gnashing of teeth
[1:17:58] now we already know that that darkness
[1:18:00] and that outer darkness
[1:18:05] is right here
[1:18:08] what is this look at that completely
[1:18:11] dark
[1:18:15] out of darkness is when the bride goes
[1:18:18] up
[1:18:20] because somebody knows if there wasn't
[1:18:21] somebody that still needed salvation
[1:18:23] that still won that salvation
[1:18:26] why would god put up with it any longer
[1:18:30] until that last one that really desires
[1:18:33] it that's god's elected unless
[1:18:35] till that last one comes in god's not
[1:18:37] going to take the blood off the earth
[1:18:40] how many knows there's blood covering
[1:18:41] the earth but when that one comes in
[1:18:44] folks talk about shutting the door how
[1:18:48] many knows that
[1:18:48] that the door was shut in the days of
[1:18:50] noah the door was shut
[1:18:52] we're living in the hour when the door
[1:18:54] is gonna get shut
[1:18:57] amen and all those outside
[1:19:00] like i said all those outside they'll be
[1:19:02] in outer darkness
[1:19:04] there won't be any light whatsoever
[1:19:06] there'll be no mercy whatsoever
[1:19:11] i believe it was also the prophet of god
[1:19:13] in uh souls in prison now talk about how
[1:19:15] that he says
[1:19:16] look at the episcopalian look at the
[1:19:18] nomination look at how they're coming
[1:19:20] for that oil
[1:19:22] he says it's at that time it's too late
[1:19:25] that's one of the things made him wonder
[1:19:26] if it was too late
[1:19:28] because the bible says remember they
[1:19:30] come for it but they never get it
[1:19:34] they never get it look how far down the
[1:19:37] road you and i are
[1:19:39] way down the road some people believe
[1:19:42] that
[1:19:43] mercy was over around 1963. isn't that
[1:19:46] right
[1:19:47] some people thought hey there's no more
[1:19:48] mercy his brother bran was teaching the
[1:19:50] seals and so forth and he was talking
[1:19:52] about
[1:19:52] when he rises to take that book and to
[1:19:54] open it mercy's over
[1:19:56] into our mind we would have thought hey
[1:19:58] mercy was over but let me tell you some
[1:20:00] aren't you glad that they were wrong
[1:20:02] aren't you glad that the prophet came
[1:20:04] back and says don't you ever believe
[1:20:05] it's all over
[1:20:07] shall we stop preaching now don't you
[1:20:08] ever believe that you keep working until
[1:20:11] he says quit
[1:20:12] amen and here i am
[1:20:16] now right here i am got saved in 1980
[1:20:18] something i believe god is still on the
[1:20:20] throne
[1:20:20] i believe there's still mercy and when
[1:20:22] he shuts the door
[1:20:23] it's going to be shut
[1:20:27] folks i know people who have went off in
[1:20:29] the false doctrine even in this message
[1:20:31] amen accept that there's no hope for
[1:20:32] this one or that or the other
[1:20:34] folks i'm very i'd be very careful about
[1:20:36] that god the only one
[1:20:37] that has a right to do that that's
[1:20:38] almighty god
[1:20:40] as long as you've got breath in your
[1:20:42] body amen and god doesn't hold you
[1:20:44] accountable and he does and amen uh lay
[1:20:47] blasphemy upon you
[1:20:49] isn't that right there's still mercy for
[1:20:51] you
[1:20:53] amen i believe our brother was talking
[1:20:56] talk about somebody he knew that amen
[1:20:59] was it your dad thought he would
[1:21:00] with no salvation for him maybe he'll
[1:21:02] testify sometime but you know
[1:21:04] brother ramsey you know it came along
[1:21:05] and hey don't think there's no hope for
[1:21:08] you when there's still hope for you
[1:21:11] but when god shuts the door we're living
[1:21:13] in the age when god is going to shut
[1:21:14] that door
[1:21:16] it's going to be over with there's going
[1:21:17] to be nothing but gross darkness upon
[1:21:19] the face of the earth
[1:21:20] and they'll be cast out into outer
[1:21:22] darkness and that's what i want to talk
[1:21:23] about look at those who will be cast out
[1:21:24] into outer
[1:21:25] one of them is an unprofitable servant
[1:21:28] how many knows brother bab says you know
[1:21:30] i wasn't there to hear him come unto me
[1:21:32] all ye who are weary and heavy laden and
[1:21:34] i will give you rest
[1:21:35] i wasn't there to hear that but i want
[1:21:37] to be there when he says
[1:21:41] well done good and faithful servant
[1:21:43] enter into the joys of the lord
[1:21:49] if you could just get the world to know
[1:21:52] that what god said
[1:21:53] is gonna come to pass it can't fail
[1:21:57] then you could shake their head and you
[1:21:59] could actually get in the hey maybe
[1:22:01] it is real you know i you know it's true
[1:22:05] that's what we try to do this morning
[1:22:07] shake every one of us and make you
[1:22:08] realize
[1:22:09] hey it's coming it's coming it's coming
[1:22:12] he's coming
[1:22:13] like the prophet god says that's what we
[1:22:15] need to do let the world know jesus
[1:22:17] is coming he's coming back
[1:22:22] and he's coming back for people that are
[1:22:24] ready
[1:22:26] that have taken this message and dressed
[1:22:27] themselves
[1:22:29] not just talked about it not just say
[1:22:31] you believe it
[1:22:32] but man says that just means you can
[1:22:34] read
[1:22:36] it takes more than that all right before
[1:22:39] we get into that let's just go
[1:22:40] look at here where are we at it's
[1:22:43] matthew 6
[1:22:47] no not 6 but 13.
[1:22:56] 36
[1:23:01] jesus sent the multitude away and went
[1:23:04] into the house and his disciples came
[1:23:06] unto him saying
[1:23:07] declare unto us the parable of the tares
[1:23:09] of the field remember
[1:23:11] the one went out and sowed good seed and
[1:23:13] the other one out and sowed bad seed
[1:23:16] he and said unto them he had soweth the
[1:23:18] good seed is the son of man
[1:23:21] amen the field is the world the good
[1:23:23] seed are the children of the kingdom
[1:23:26] but the terrors are the children
[1:23:29] of the wicked one people don't believe
[1:23:32] in
[1:23:32] seed they don't believe that the devil
[1:23:34] had a seed or that
[1:23:36] cain according to first john 3 12
[1:23:39] not as cain who was a murderer the bible
[1:23:42] says
[1:23:42] not as cain who was of the wicked one
[1:23:47] that's where the lineage of satan seed
[1:23:49] came in
[1:23:50] through cain amen
[1:23:54] of the wicked one and no matter how much
[1:23:56] mercy god had for him
[1:23:58] god came down and not just talked to
[1:24:00] adam and eve but he came out to down to
[1:24:02] the serpent
[1:24:02] isn't that right and even to cain after
[1:24:05] he murdered his brother
[1:24:08] he says you know if you'll do what your
[1:24:09] brother does hey you'll be accepted
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:13] he walked away from it
[1:24:16] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[1:24:18] the harvest is the end of the world
[1:24:20] and the reapers are the angels as
[1:24:22] therefore the tares
[1:24:24] are gathered and burned into fire so
[1:24:27] shall it be
[1:24:28] at the end of this world
[1:24:31] the son of man shall send forth his
[1:24:33] angels and they shall gather out of his
[1:24:34] kingdom
[1:24:35] all things that offend and them that do
[1:24:38] iniquity i want you to know something
[1:24:39] that
[1:24:40] them that do iniquity are certainly
[1:24:42] bundling together
[1:24:44] and then he'll cast them into a furnace
[1:24:47] of fire
[1:24:48] there shall be weeping and gnashing
[1:24:51] of teeth but then shall the righteous
[1:24:55] shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
[1:24:58] of their father who hath ears to hear
[1:25:02] let him hear amen
[1:25:07] let's go to another parable verse 47 a
[1:25:10] kingdom again the kingdom of heaven is
[1:25:12] like an antoinette
[1:25:14] that was cast into the sea and gathered
[1:25:16] every kind
[1:25:18] which when it was full they drew to
[1:25:20] shore and sat down and gathered the good
[1:25:22] into vessels and cast the bed away
[1:25:26] so shall it be at the end of the world
[1:25:28] the angels shall come forth
[1:25:29] and sever the wicked from among the just
[1:25:32] do you realize that
[1:25:34] realistically speaking the righteous and
[1:25:36] the unrighteous
[1:25:38] there is a great golf fix between them
[1:25:41] anymore
[1:25:42] the golf is getting bigger and bigger
[1:25:44] and bigger
[1:25:46] folks i want you to know if i came up
[1:25:48] here and i condone some of that stuff
[1:25:49] that's going out there
[1:25:50] y'all kicked me out of here quite fast
[1:25:52] and i could say
[1:25:53] whatever why
[1:25:56] you know that that ain't right if you
[1:25:59] was to say certain things i know that
[1:26:00] you ain't right
[1:26:02] what is it there's a gulf the gulf is
[1:26:04] getting greater but
[1:26:05] guess what it's getting darker and
[1:26:07] darker and that's why it's so
[1:26:11] it's the time to shine the least little
[1:26:14] light
[1:26:15] shines brightly in the darkness that's
[1:26:17] what you and i are we're lights
[1:26:19] in the darkness okay
[1:26:22] so he says listen sever the wicked from
[1:26:25] among the just and shall cast them into
[1:26:27] a furnace of fire
[1:26:29] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[1:26:32] teeth
[1:26:33] how many knows there's a fire coming
[1:26:35] both the heavens and the earth shall be
[1:26:37] on fire
[1:26:38] it's going to be a furnace of fire that
[1:26:39] they get cast in
[1:26:42] malachi 4 said behold the day cometh
[1:26:44] that shall burn as an oven
[1:26:46] in that right yea and all that do
[1:26:48] wickedly
[1:26:49] amen shall be ashes under the soles of
[1:26:51] your feet
[1:26:53] but malachi 4 i want to read that just
[1:26:56] right quick is that okay
[1:26:58] but it says
[1:27:02] it shall be stumbled in the day that
[1:27:03] cometh shall burn them up saith the lord
[1:27:05] of hosts
[1:27:06] malachi 4 1 and it shall leave them
[1:27:08] neither root nor
[1:27:09] branch but verse 5 says but behold i
[1:27:12] will send you elijah the prophet before
[1:27:15] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:27:17] of the lord
[1:27:19] brother says whenever a sign whenever a
[1:27:21] prophet comes on the scene remember
[1:27:22] judgment is closed at hand
[1:27:26] one of the signs one of the sure signs
[1:27:28] that we know that the great and dreadful
[1:27:30] day
[1:27:30] of the lord is real close at hand it's
[1:27:32] because of the fact that he sent
[1:27:34] that prophet when that prophet comes on
[1:27:36] the scene lift up your heads
[1:27:38] fire's fixing to fall it's not far off
[1:27:42] i mean he believes that it's not far
[1:27:45] off but you and i aren't supposed to be
[1:27:48] here

[1:28:10] times

[1:28:46] somebody in there that didn't have a
[1:28:48] wedding garment

[1:31:08] christ should be the center of it all
[1:31:11] because there's nothing else to live for
[1:31:13] there's nothing else that's going to
[1:31:14] stand when it's all said and done
[1:31:17] amen so church

[1:31:24] and get ready praise the lord
[1:31:28] all right so those are people that won't
[1:31:31] be there people who
[1:31:33] deceived themselves they told themselves
[1:31:36] they were right when really they knew
[1:31:38] they weren't and you can look you can
[1:31:42] you can go on brother bam's message and
[1:31:43] you take a message and this bible that's
[1:31:45] how i
[1:31:45] check myself check yourself according to
[1:31:47] the word of god and the message that god
[1:31:49] sent to this generation
[1:31:51] amen and see if you line up with that
[1:31:55] see if that's your heart's desire amen
[1:31:58] because if it isn't anywhere in here if
[1:32:00] it isn't that's what we're here for this
[1:32:02] morning
[1:32:05] amen to work out our
[1:32:08] own salvation make sure you're saved
[1:32:12] the believer does that we're not scared
[1:32:15] that hey we got to do this saturday
[1:32:17] no we rely on the lord jesus christ but
[1:32:19] we want to make sure that we're right
[1:32:21] with the lord
[1:32:22] as believers you do that otherwise you
[1:32:25] may not care
[1:32:27] make believer unbeliever you don't care
[1:32:30] and people will deceive themselves and
[1:32:32] be totally disappointed
[1:32:34] on that day
[1:32:41] how many have you ever done that how
[1:32:42] many you ever take a good look at
[1:32:43] yourself
[1:32:46] did you like what you saw
[1:32:49] me neither but you better take a look at
[1:32:53] yourself
[1:32:54] and then you need to look at him because
[1:32:57] even the prophet says don't just look at
[1:32:59] yourself man you'll be a failure of
[1:33:00] total
[1:33:01] but you look at him and say lord jesus i
[1:33:02] accept your righteousness
[1:33:04] lord cha change me from what i am
[1:33:08] how many knows you're going to have to
[1:33:09] do some changing this year every one of
[1:33:11] us is going to have to make some changes
[1:33:18] changes brother batman
[1:33:22] make a statement after you told us about
[1:33:24] beyond the curtain of time
[1:33:26] brother bam says that's what bothers me
[1:33:28] though
[1:33:29] to preach to you people don't remain
[1:33:33] on the same condition that you've been
[1:33:34] going in
[1:33:36] amen think about it but about a
[1:33:38] preaching preaching preaching preaching
[1:33:40] people wouldn't change
[1:33:42] he says look you've got to change
[1:33:44] something's got to change here
[1:33:47] amen we've got to change
[1:33:51] oh my praise the lord god has to come
[1:33:54] down and
[1:33:55] do a change in our life
[1:33:59] now after how many knows that after
[1:34:02] brother ben preached all the revelation
[1:34:03] of the seven seals
[1:34:04] huh then he preached desperation the
[1:34:06] token leadership and so forth
[1:34:08] when he came to the token what did he
[1:34:09] say this is the most relevant
[1:34:11] up-to-date most important message up to
[1:34:14] now
[1:34:16] the token that's what i want to talk
[1:34:20] about for a few minutes
[1:34:22] the token he went back to israel when
[1:34:24] they put the their
[1:34:25] the death angel was coming into the land
[1:34:27] in that right and all the firstborn was
[1:34:29] going to get skilled
[1:34:32] and he says put slay the lamb take the
[1:34:35] blood
[1:34:36] put it on the lenthil of the door and
[1:34:38] the lentil is the top
[1:34:39] and on the post and man smear it on
[1:34:42] there and put it on the top
[1:34:44] because anybody that isn't behind that
[1:34:47] will die
[1:34:48] i don't care how much israel you are i
[1:34:50] don't care how much of promise you have
[1:34:52] i don't care
[1:34:53] what my deal is with you it's all null
[1:34:55] and void if you don't do this
[1:34:58] the prophet god comes along and that's
[1:35:00] us
[1:35:02] amen and paul was the same way paul in
[1:35:05] 1st corinthians 13 talk
[1:35:06] he says you know though i can understand
[1:35:09] all mysteries
[1:35:11] don't you understand all the mysteries
[1:35:14] though you have faith to move mountains
[1:35:19] and brother bam in the token says you
[1:35:20] mean i can do all this and still be lost
[1:35:22] that's exactly right
[1:35:24] you can have faith to move mountains
[1:35:26] cast out devils and all these other
[1:35:28] things
[1:35:28] but you still ain't got what it takes
[1:35:31] you better have the love of god in your
[1:35:33] heart
[1:35:34] isn't that right but do i have not
[1:35:37] charity do i give my body to be burnt
[1:35:40] but if i ain't got this i'm still zero
[1:35:46] when he preached that token he says you
[1:35:48] know it doesn't matter how good you are
[1:35:50] how much faithful you are in church on
[1:35:52] how you dress
[1:35:53] what good deeds you've done how much
[1:35:54] missionary how much preacher you are he
[1:35:56] said you could be a preacher in this
[1:35:57] pulpit
[1:35:59] hello but then you come up here and say
[1:36:01] well the holy ghost was just for the
[1:36:03] twelve
[1:36:04] huh you can be a preacher but yet if you
[1:36:07] don't feel i believe that full word
[1:36:09] remember
[1:36:10] it's going to do you no good
[1:36:14] amen
[1:36:17] that's right now notice
[1:36:21] one thing that he said about i want to
[1:36:22] just make a couple points on here if i
[1:36:23] would
[1:36:24] if you don't mind one of them was it was
[1:36:27] required
[1:36:28] that they apply the token isn't that
[1:36:30] right and
[1:36:31] number two was that the token token is
[1:36:34] displayed
[1:36:35] in public
[1:36:40] now let me just talk about
[1:36:44] john 3 nicodemus came to jesus by night
[1:36:47] isn't that right and he says uh what
[1:36:50] must i be do right and jesus
[1:36:52] says you must be born again you must be
[1:36:55] born again
[1:36:56] he didn't know for sure what to do and
[1:36:58] he says i come to i go back in my
[1:36:59] mother's womb no he says
[1:37:00] unless a man is born of water and of
[1:37:03] spirit he will in no
[1:37:05] wise enter into the kingdom somebody
[1:37:08] knows without that token without the
[1:37:10] holy ghost
[1:37:11] you're not going
[1:37:19] not going without the holy ghost
[1:37:24] and number two the second part of it
[1:37:28] is the way the the token is a positive
[1:37:32] identification
[1:37:33] that the lamb has been killed
[1:37:37] so in other words jesus on calvary and
[1:37:40] you believing in jesus and saying you
[1:37:43] believe
[1:37:44] the only thing that tells you positive
[1:37:47] that the lamb
[1:37:48] died for you is when god baptizes you
[1:37:51] with
[1:37:52] the holy ghost the holy ghost is a
[1:37:56] positive token he says that the lamb
[1:37:58] has died
[1:38:02] because how many numbers it don't matter
[1:38:04] how much he died a pardon is not a
[1:38:06] pardon unless it's received as a pardon
[1:38:09] amen and if you haven't got the holy
[1:38:11] ghost god has never accepted your
[1:38:14] sacrifice yet
[1:38:18] come on folks preach with me amen when
[1:38:22] you get the holy ghost only when you get
[1:38:23] the holy ghost that is your sign that
[1:38:25] hey that
[1:38:26] is for me he died for me
[1:38:29] you can say you believe all you want to
[1:38:32] you can say your message believe it all
[1:38:33] you want to
[1:38:34] you can say you believe the message all
[1:38:36] you want to not gonna do you any good
[1:38:39] unless token comes down and verifies
[1:38:42] that you believe
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:52] so notice the holy ghost is a positive
[1:38:55] token that your land died
[1:38:57] and that you received the token upon
[1:38:59] yourself for his very life
[1:39:01] is in you there's no make believe
[1:39:04] there's no put on huh no impersonation
[1:39:08] of it
[1:39:09] oh may god help me both present and into
[1:39:12] tape
[1:39:12] to pin that down that no matter you
[1:39:16] might have preached the gospel you might
[1:39:17] have cast out devils you might have
[1:39:18] spoke with tongues you might have
[1:39:20] shouted you better dance in the spirit
[1:39:21] but without that token
[1:39:23] huh say i can do it yes that's exactly
[1:39:26] right paul said you could
[1:39:28] you can even speak in tongues and
[1:39:30] interpreting tongues
[1:39:31] though i speak with tongues of men and
[1:39:33] angels and have not charity
[1:39:35] i am nothing don't you rely upon that
[1:39:37] amen
[1:39:38] it's the token no matter how much you've
[1:39:40] done how good you are
[1:39:42] the wrath of god still is going to go
[1:39:43] right over top and get you
[1:39:46] only thing that's going to be recognized
[1:39:49] is the token it is a token that the
[1:39:52] price has been paid
[1:39:53] that's been required the price that was
[1:39:56] paid for was the life of jesus christ
[1:39:58] he gave his life and his spirit comes
[1:40:00] back upon you as a token that you have
[1:40:02] received then you carry that token with
[1:40:05] you
[1:40:06] on wednesday night and sunday night and
[1:40:08] whenever you get around people that you
[1:40:10] think you ought to pack right around
[1:40:14] don't sound right does it no
[1:40:18] not just on sunday it's all the time you
[1:40:20] have the token
[1:40:22] oh my you say well i'm uh you say i
[1:40:25] still believe i am a believer that's all
[1:40:27] right but if you reject that token
[1:40:30] let me tell you something that's his
[1:40:31] service today unless the token is in the
[1:40:33] on the door
[1:40:34] there is a spiritual death gonna strike
[1:40:38] hello there's a spiritual death that's
[1:40:41] gonna strike
[1:40:42] amen if you don't get that token put on
[1:40:44] your door
[1:40:46] all churches are headed back to it to
[1:40:49] the world council of churches
[1:40:50] they're going back to catholicism
[1:40:53] let me know we've got another catholic
[1:40:55] president now
[1:40:57] catholicism when we had the first one
[1:41:00] you know what brother baum said
[1:41:01] that makes us a catholic nation
[1:41:05] amen oh my
[1:41:08] listen and only those who are genuine
[1:41:11] born again
[1:41:12] are going to stay out remember you
[1:41:15] pentecostal denominations because
[1:41:16] they're already in
[1:41:17] it shows they are dead they're perished
[1:41:19] they went back they put him outside the
[1:41:21] door
[1:41:24] pentecost put put jesus outside of their
[1:41:26] door
[1:41:29] revelation 3 behold i stand at the door
[1:41:32] and knock he was put outside the church
[1:41:35] jesus would come down and tell you what
[1:41:37] your problem was where you come from
[1:41:39] over and over and over again and it says
[1:41:42] don't you go to the brother band's
[1:41:43] meeting see
[1:41:44] it's fortune telling he put him out it
[1:41:47] wasn't brother playing them telling you
[1:41:48] that was jesus telling them
[1:41:50] who they were and what they were it was
[1:41:51] a sign of the messiah
[1:41:54] he's looking for the token because the
[1:41:56] only thing that they relied on was
[1:41:58] tongues
[1:41:58] don't you rely on speaking in tongues or
[1:42:00] nothing else but let the token itself be
[1:42:03] there the person
[1:42:04] of jesus christ letting
[1:42:07] jesus live in 2021 how many believes
[1:42:11] that we need to let
[1:42:12] jesus live
[1:42:19] i'm going to finish just here in a
[1:42:20] second but i want to look at what paul
[1:42:23] said
[1:42:23] it's got to be biblical right
[1:42:27] paul said in philippians
[1:42:44] maybe it was galatians galatians 2 i
[1:42:47] believe it was
[1:42:49] paul said 2 and 20 i am crucified with
[1:42:52] christ
[1:42:53] nevertheless i live yet not i
[1:42:57] but it's christ that liveth in me
[1:43:00] and we believe that's 20 21 for us
[1:43:03] i'm alive but guess what it's not me
[1:43:06] living my life
[1:43:07] it's christ living out through me
[1:43:12] greatest battle ever fought says the
[1:43:14] devil really doesn't have any strength
[1:43:16] or power
[1:43:17] unless he has somebody to work through
[1:43:20] how about god how many knows that we're
[1:43:22] god's temple know ye not
[1:43:24] that you are the temple of the holy
[1:43:27] ghost
[1:43:28] you are god's temple
[1:43:33] the only jesus people's going to see is
[1:43:35] when they look at you
[1:43:37] your reaction and action to whatever it
[1:43:39] is
[1:43:41] it's the only thing that's accepted but
[1:43:44] christ liveth in me and the life that i
[1:43:46] now live in the flesh i live by the
[1:43:48] faith
[1:43:48] of the son of god who gave he loved me
[1:43:51] and
[1:43:52] gave himself for me
[1:43:55] praise the lord listen
[1:43:58] don't rely on just speaking in tongues
[1:44:00] no the token has to be there the person
[1:44:02] of jesus christ
[1:44:03] the faith of jesus christ not just this
[1:44:05] that but circumcise your
[1:44:08] whole baby
[1:44:12] what is it brother ma'am says that
[1:44:13] causes people to be halfway christians
[1:44:16] and lukewarm it's because
[1:44:17] their own ways get mixed up into it
[1:44:22] let me tell you something i believe
[1:44:23] every one of us is growing into the full
[1:44:26] stature of christ
[1:44:27] into the fullness of christ that means
[1:44:29] until god governs
[1:44:31] to every part of you who's with me lord
[1:44:34] i want you to govern
[1:44:36] every part of me every part of my life
[1:44:39] i want you to have supreme control
[1:44:45] god could have brought us to the earth
[1:44:47] and have us to fulfill
[1:44:48] his perfect will do the right thing
[1:44:50] every time but we were born
[1:44:52] completely wrong the carnal mind is
[1:44:55] enmity against god
[1:44:56] we have to learn to surrender ourself
[1:45:00] to his will how do you think we're ever
[1:45:02] gonna get along with god up there
[1:45:05] you're gonna are you gonna go up there
[1:45:07] and say now god i think you ought to do
[1:45:08] this you ought to do that
[1:45:10] i don't think this is a good idea and i
[1:45:13] don't think that was a good idea
[1:45:14] no god doesn't want to argue with you
[1:45:17] huh lord whatever
[1:45:21] you want lord i want to do thy will as a
[1:45:23] song so
[1:45:24] i want to do thy will take me mold me
[1:45:26] make me break me lord but i want to do
[1:45:29] your will
[1:45:31] because jesus says only those that do my
[1:45:33] will
[1:45:34] will enter in not your will not your way
[1:45:37] how many knows this isn't the hour this
[1:45:39] is the time
[1:45:39] amen that you must be born again by the
[1:45:42] baptism we got to completely die
[1:45:44] to our own thinking into our own ways
[1:45:50] more now than ever come on folks i don't
[1:45:52] need to hear an amen from you
[1:45:54] that ain't nothing are you going are you
[1:45:56] going with me then you're going to have
[1:45:57] to die
[1:45:58] to your own thinking you're going to
[1:45:59] have to die to your own ways
[1:46:01] you're going to have to die you're going
[1:46:03] to have to be crucified to yourself
[1:46:05] and to the way that you want to think
[1:46:08] that's not what heaven is going to be
[1:46:09] full of it's a bunch of people that want
[1:46:11] to do
[1:46:12] it their way that's why we got the chaos
[1:46:13] that we do that's why we don't have
[1:46:15] brotherhood like we do
[1:46:17] that's why every church goes their own
[1:46:18] way because they don't come subject to
[1:46:20] what god said
[1:46:21] let me tell you something one thing that
[1:46:23] this mess this does you see you gotta
[1:46:25] forget what the army's taught you
[1:46:27] you gotta forget what your
[1:46:28] denominational brothers and sisters do
[1:46:29] everybody else told you
[1:46:30] encounter what god said and prove and
[1:46:33] vindicate it
[1:46:34] that's what you gotta come to that's
[1:46:36] what god's coming for
[1:46:38] somebody to set aside their own ways
[1:46:40] their own thoughts their own lives
[1:46:43] and let christ live that's let christ
[1:46:45] live
[1:46:46] he wants to live
[1:46:50] he wants to bring joy unspeakable he
[1:46:53] wants to take the gloom out of your life
[1:46:55] he wants to bring peace in your life
[1:46:59] amen satan come to destroy but i came to
[1:47:03] give life
[1:47:04] and that more abundantly i believes he's
[1:47:06] here to give you life
[1:47:07] more abundantly joy unspeakable it
[1:47:11] doesn't matter how
[1:47:12] chaotic how ugly how sinful how wicked
[1:47:15] the world gets
[1:47:17] or what they're trying to pressure you
[1:47:19] into you are sealed and with god
[1:47:21] take my head off but don't take christ
[1:47:24] from me
[1:47:25] and then paul said for you to live his
[1:47:27] christ to die is gain
[1:47:29] because i know what's right on the other
[1:47:30] side amen you loving this morning
[1:47:34] that's what it's going to take if you're
[1:47:37] going to be in the rapture
[1:47:38] a complete death to yourself and just
[1:47:42] christ
[1:47:42] to be living his life out through you
[1:47:47] that's the token the only thing that
[1:47:49] he's coming for
[1:47:51] amen praise the lord
[1:47:58] how many believes it's time to become
[1:47:59] the message not to say you believe the
[1:48:01] message
[1:48:02] same with the bible don't just say i
[1:48:03] believe the bible it's time to become
[1:48:05] the bible
[1:48:07] brother baby says don't just say comes
[1:48:09] this far and say well i believe the
[1:48:11] message
[1:48:12] you obey the message come into christ
[1:48:14] you see i believe every word you said
[1:48:16] brother madam that's good
[1:48:18] but that's just being able to read
[1:48:24] oh i believe every word you say hey has
[1:48:27] that belief that you say you had has it
[1:48:29] brought the holy ghost in your heart
[1:48:32] because i guarantee you if you believe
[1:48:34] the word the word of god
[1:48:36] he will fill you with the holy ghost
[1:48:39] amen
[1:48:40] that's the only thing he's not going to
[1:48:42] ask if you did you believe
[1:48:44] huh the bible says the devils believe
[1:48:48] and tremble they know it

[1:51:18] brothers and sisters don't remain in the
[1:51:20] same condition he says
[1:51:22] listen i've seen
[1:51:25] tens of thousands of visions
[1:51:31] signs and wonders and none of them
[1:51:34] have ever failed oh my how many knows if
[1:51:38] it's god
[1:51:39] it's not going to fail if you can
[1:51:41] conjure it up oh it's going to fail
[1:51:43] but if god spoke through the prophet it
[1:51:45] was god speaking it couldn't fail
[1:51:49] i don't know why i want to keep saying
[1:51:50] this but i'm going to
[1:51:52] say it again and i may not get it
[1:51:54] exactly right but this is the
[1:51:56] the surrounding of it brother branham
[1:51:58] called a woman out one time
[1:51:59] and he told her the number of her
[1:52:01] address
[1:52:03] where she was at where she had where she
[1:52:05] lived at
[1:52:06] and after the service a sister come up
[1:52:09] and said sister he told you wrong
[1:52:11] about your address you got your address
[1:52:14] wrong
[1:52:15] this is you know i moved just the other
[1:52:18] day
[1:52:18] that address is correct oh and that's
[1:52:22] just one of thousands
[1:52:23] thousands of things things like that
[1:52:26] amen that's happened that god would come
[1:52:29] let me tell you something
[1:52:30] what god has done in this generation oh
[1:52:33] my
[1:52:35] the books couldn't hold it all the
[1:52:37] things that's happened
[1:52:38] is that right all the things that's
[1:52:40] happened what god did and what he did
[1:52:42] and so forth and it'll bring on the
[1:52:43] destruction of the world
[1:52:45] because people will not believe what god
[1:52:47] did
[1:52:49] to disbelieve what god has done hey if i
[1:52:51] do something you just believe it that
[1:52:52] you ain't going to go to hell for that
[1:52:54] at all
[1:52:54] when you disbelieve what god does that's
[1:52:57] a whole different story
[1:52:59] that's why this world is going the way
[1:53:00] that it is
[1:53:04] i was listening to first and second
[1:53:06] samuel the other day
[1:53:07] and i remember and they went through the
[1:53:08] place where uh they wanted a king over
[1:53:11] them
[1:53:12] you know because god would speak to
[1:53:13] samuel right and he'd tell them where to
[1:53:15] fight how to fight and
[1:53:17] what to do and so forth in that right
[1:53:19] and god was their king
[1:53:20] samuel was their prophet but they didn't
[1:53:24] want it that way that's the way god had
[1:53:26] ordained it to be
[1:53:28] amen that's how it was supposed to
[1:53:30] operate but they wanted the king
[1:53:32] and god says go ahead and give them one
[1:53:33] they've not rejected you but they
[1:53:35] rejected me
[1:53:38] and i believe that's the way it ought to
[1:53:39] have been in our world
[1:53:41] when god sent brother branham we
[1:53:44] wouldn't have to worry about russia
[1:53:45] china or anybody
[1:53:46] if we dismissed our president
[1:53:49] huh and said this is the guy that's
[1:53:51] going to run things
[1:53:52] we've been in good shape isn't that
[1:53:55] right if the whole nation
[1:53:56] would have been like solomon the queen
[1:53:59] of the south came all the way from the
[1:54:01] other most parts of here the wisdom of
[1:54:02] solomon
[1:54:03] isn't that right that's who should have
[1:54:06] been the
[1:54:07] leader god's prophet that's how god
[1:54:09] meant for it to be
[1:54:11] amen and the same way today the churches
[1:54:14] the ones that claim to love the lord
[1:54:17] rejected and crucified this word
[1:54:20] and what christ did in this generation
[1:54:22] that's why it's going down
[1:54:25] but there's a group of people how many
[1:54:26] please you're a part of that group of
[1:54:27] people
[1:54:28] that say god that's what i want i want
[1:54:30] to i want to do whatever you want me to
[1:54:32] do lord
[1:54:32] let me say this in closing
[1:54:38] he mentions you know the one thing that
[1:54:39] we got to have and we know that love is
[1:54:41] corrective
[1:54:42] am i right it takes a lot of courage
[1:54:46] sometimes
[1:54:46] just like it did with john the baptist
[1:54:48] when he uh told that
[1:54:50] that king he says it ain't right for you
[1:54:52] to have her you know right
[1:54:54] preach marriage divorce and it cost him
[1:54:56] his head
[1:54:57] and one thing christians will do is
[1:54:59] stand up for what's truth stand for
[1:55:01] what's right
[1:55:02] isn't that right love is corrective
[1:55:07] that's why he jesus said in revelations
[1:55:10] the third chapter
[1:55:12] as many as i love i rebuke
[1:55:15] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[1:55:18] repent
[1:55:19] because we certainly need i don't know
[1:55:20] about you but i need more rebuking
[1:55:23] lord you're not thomas you're not doing
[1:55:25] as much as what you should you're not
[1:55:26] praying like you ought to you need to be
[1:55:28] more sincere
[1:55:30] amen okay
[1:55:35] i'm gonna finish this over here you
[1:55:36] should love one another
[1:55:38] first up here death is in the land today
[1:55:41] judgment is waiting
[1:55:43] she's pending amen
[1:55:47] how many has ever had a sale pending
[1:55:49] this sale is pending it's just kind of
[1:55:51] waiting there
[1:55:52] the judgment and the wrath of god is
[1:55:55] just
[1:55:56] waiting isn't it something how that god
[1:55:59] was so patient in the days of noah
[1:56:01] he didn't want anybody to be lost he let
[1:56:04] it go on and on and on and on until
[1:56:06] guess what he says i better take
[1:56:07] somebody
[1:56:08] right nobody gonna be saved and eight of
[1:56:11] them made it out of it
[1:56:12] he said that about that are they he's
[1:56:14] going to be very patient
[1:56:17] but he's going to have to come and catch
[1:56:18] us away or there will be no flesh saved
[1:56:20] will i even find anybody with faith on
[1:56:23] the earth
[1:56:24] judgment is waiting she's pending
[1:56:27] atomic hydrants hydrogens and all kinds
[1:56:31] of disasters

[1:56:36] nations

[1:56:39] believes that
[1:56:41] and now the tokens got to be applied oh
[1:56:43] my
[1:56:44] except the man be born of the spirit and
[1:56:46] of water he will in no wise
[1:56:48] enter in you should love one another
[1:56:50] believers should separate themselves

[1:56:56] world you we don't

[1:57:35] gone men respect

[1:57:39] homes together and so forth
[1:57:41] notice we are not just to come together
[1:57:43] to talk about the message
[1:57:44] they are to come together to apply the
[1:57:47] blood
[1:57:49] apply the token that's what you must do
[1:57:52] pastor neville i'll put my name brother
[1:57:54] byler the congregation trustee deacon
[1:57:57] you brother and it's time to lay aside
[1:57:59] all the foolishness of the world
[1:58:02] i mean it's time to get more sincere
[1:58:04] time to lay aside everything else we've
[1:58:06] seen enough now
[1:58:07] we're positive sure that the token must
[1:58:09] be applied
[1:58:10] without it you're going to perish
[1:58:13] you must perish that is the only thing
[1:58:16] oh don't just come together and say i
[1:58:18] believe it
[1:58:19] get beneath it get into it
[1:58:22] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[1:58:25] into
[1:58:26] one body praise the lord
[1:58:34] i've seen tenth of thousands of visions
[1:58:36] signs and wonders none of them ever
[1:58:37] failed
[1:58:38] he's foretold me things it's and it's
[1:58:41] never failed to happen
[1:58:42] exactly that way i'll bring any man to
[1:58:45] trial for that that's right
[1:58:47] but you listen to me thus saith the lord
[1:58:51] it'll take perfect love to put you in
[1:58:53] that place for that's
[1:58:54] all there was there
[1:58:58] no matter how many religious
[1:58:59] demonstrations how many good deeds
[1:59:00] you've done
[1:59:01] whatever you've done how many knows that
[1:59:03] the holy spirit god
[1:59:05] is love
[1:59:08] if you don't have the love of god in
[1:59:09] your heart like you should this morning
[1:59:12] i believe when we have the altar call
[1:59:13] and when we raise our hands say god
[1:59:15] i don't have enough love that i should
[1:59:17] have
[1:59:18] i mean at least you should have we all
[1:59:20] could use more of the love of god
[1:59:22] whatever you've done it won't count for
[1:59:23] nothing it'll take perfect love so
[1:59:25] whatever you do
[1:59:26] lays out everything else until you're
[1:59:27] just so filled with the love of god till
[1:59:30] you can love those
[1:59:32] he said who hates you but i'm going to
[1:59:33] put it this way until
[1:59:35] people can false accuse you lie about
[1:59:39] you
[1:59:40] and actually have you killed
[1:59:43] and just before they kill you
[1:59:46] you don't oh you know what it ain't
[1:59:48] right they're not just before they kill
[1:59:50] you
[1:59:51] you have so much love in your heart you
[1:59:53] can say god don't lay this to their
[1:59:54] charge
[1:59:56] forgive them for they don't know what to
[1:59:58] do
[1:59:59] that's what jesus did when they stoned
[2:00:02] stephen
[2:00:03] when jesus told when stephen told them
[2:00:05] the truth and preached
[2:00:06] them says you always resist the holy
[2:00:08] ghost
[2:00:09] you know and so forth and they got so
[2:00:12] mad at him dude
[2:00:14] stoned him and just before dying he says
[2:00:17] forgive them
[2:00:18] why he had that perfect love that no
[2:00:22] matter what anybody else did
[2:00:24] they were so in love with god they could
[2:00:26] love everybody even
[2:00:27] their worst enemy how many wants to be
[2:00:31] that way
[2:00:32] god bless you stand with me tonight this
[2:00:38] morning

[2:00:42] their heads

[2:00:55] yourself
[2:00:56] of all that has been said how much did
[2:01:00] the spirit

[2:01:04] maybe it didn't mean a thing then this
[2:01:06] probably won't be a lot of good
[2:01:08] but if in your heart the word somewhere
[2:01:11] something that's been said
