a voice and y'all pray for her y'all pray for our youth all across y'all know my love for the youth and i see a gift god's placed in her life and you see some of the songs that she's wrote and wrote that was a good one and but you know what god places his gifts in his body and if we let him use them they're a blessing to each every one of us and tell you what i'm just happy in the lord and you said it's inauguration day we got a new president but i still have the same god and he ain't changed from yesterday and he ain't going to change tomorrow and he still promised me a rapture is coming for me and if it takes another president to get me there then bring him on because i'm striving and i'm desiring to go to that heavenly home amen turn in your bibles tonight if you would first chronicles first chronicles 22. there's some of this just trying to come into my mind this evening and sitting in the back room and i pray to be a blessing to you i think we are living in the last day and i think you know sometimes it gets common and we say it too much maybe and it gets common on our minds but we need to open our eyes and realize the hand welding handwriting's on the wall we need to realize the signs of the time are amongst us you need to realize that we're living the day that god promised was coming for his bride i'm not sure exactly the title is laying on my heart god's prayer god's plan god god's battle plan for his bride god's battle plan for his bride i don't believe god goes unnoticed i don't believe he goes surprised i believe he knows what we're facing and i believe he has everything that we need to get out of here and we find in the scripture just to lay a little background first chronic verse 28 did i say 20 what did i say 22 then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of the burnt offering for israel and david commanded to gather together the strangers that was in the land of israel and he sent these masons to whoever wrote stones to build the house of god david prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the door and the gates for the joinings and the brass and the abundance without weights and also cedar trees in abundance for the zeneons and that they detail would brought much cedar wood to david and david said solomon my son is younger and tender and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceedingly magnificent a frame and of glory and throughout all countries i will therefore now make preparation for it and so david prepared abundantly before his death and he called solomon his son and he charged him to build a house for the lord god and david said unto solomon my son as for me it is in my mind to build a house for the name of the lord my god let's get down to verse 14 and says now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the lord a hundred thousand talents of gold a thousand thousand talents of silver and breasts and iron without weight for it is an abundance timber also in stone have i prepared that there mayest add there too and moreover there are workmen in their abundance hearers and workers of stone and timber and all the manner of cunning men of every manner of work of gold in a silver and a brass and of iron and there is no number arise therefore and be doing that the lord be with thee david also commanded under the princes of israel to help solomon his son saying it is not the lord your god with you for he has not given you rest on every side for he has given the inhabitants of the land of my hand and the land subdued before the lord before his people now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god arise therefore and build you a sanctuary of the lord god and to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vegetables of god into the house that is to be built in the name of the lord let's just say a word of prayer heavenly father lord we thank you for another opportunity together under your blessing lord under your roof lord that we could hear from your word lord what i believe is we're drawing nigh to the end we need to be encouraged we need to be given into war lord we need to be ready for the battle because it is at hand lord i asked you to touch this lord i asked you to relieve me lord of my duties of what i'm able to do lord and speak through this vessel lord move me aside lord that you may say something to your people lord you know with our needs you know the desires you know their hearts lord i ask you to bless them in your lovely name we pray amen and amen and you'll be seated my thought is try to go back and i don't read the bible as much as i would like but i try to go back and read the bible and and see what is laying in there for us because i believe we're living in a time that god has a battle plan that he has prepared for us he's prepared a battle plan for a bride to go into a rapture he knew that it wouldn't be easy from the beginning but yet he never gets tucked back he never gets took astray that he doesn't prepare what we have need of and as i was beginning to read and we know later earlier we heard that there was a prophecy went forth that solomon would build this point and i began to look as david knew in his heart this was the plan of god that this plan was to build this this sanctuary for the for the word to be stored in but yet he knew solomon had to do it but yet david knew he could prepare the way and he began to prepare all of the wood and all of the gold and all of the silver the iron so much he began to repair it why because there was a battle coming that had to be victorious and a battle don't just pop up and you win there's a training aspect there's a there's a pre-planning of that battle for you to overcome that battle and i believe that david knew all that would come against solomon in building that temple but yet he would prepare him everything that he had need of and god help us to not to see that's why god sent a prophet in our day to prepare us for this battle that god has for us to prepare us everything that we have needed to be able to overcome the devil at his greatest in satan's eating when he's at his greatest tempters of all to be able to overcome and win that battle and i began to think yeah here is david david knew how real it would be he knew how the devil knew that this was the plan of god he knew how david will or the dead the devil would come against solomon in every way and so yet he set out to prepare for the battle he said to prepare for the building of this tabernacle and he set all of these things in place and he said now solomon be of good courage this is what god has for you to do i think oh god in a day we need encouragement to know this is what god has the bride to do god has placed in us to go into a rapture he has placed in us to live in 2021 he has placed in us when the world's fallen apart to be a strong tower for those that don't have the faith he has placed in us to be examples to the world to let them see we are the bride of christ that christ is still living in this world and you know what i believe that god didn't go into this unattended he didn't go into this thinking that oh yeah they're figured out when they get there no he pre-planned this exactly to the t of what we would go through he pre-planned the battles that we would overcome he preparing the character that we would build in ourselves he pre-planned all of this because he knows what we're going to face in this day he knows what we're going to come against in this day he knows the faith that we need he knows the strength that we need and so he laid a battle plan he laid this battle plan out so that we would know you said you believe we're living that we're living in that day now we're living in the day that it's the time for her battle it's the time for a bride to stand up and be recognized for who she is it's time for a bride to recognize who she is and to take action in the fact that god has called her on the scene now i began to think oh god one of my favorite stories from a childhood all the way up was the three hebrew children and the three who were children would come out and that they would stand and they would stand for the word of god and they would stand in the face of the king against all of the critics against the body that looked down up on them but yet when they went to that fiery party god would stand for them but i begin to think oh god it didn't start on the day that they asked him to bow to the image it started years before that it started in pre-planning us as children in school it started as teachers would begin to teach them the scrolls of the bible what the prophets had said what all of this was planning because there was coming a battle one day you know what they never would have overcome it if they wouldn't have listened in sunday school if they wouldn't have listened to the preaching of the word if they wouldn't had an experience of themselves that wasn't their first experience with god helping them out they had been through trials before they've been through you know you know just help me to say this right but you know we get this complexion we get this mental image in our heads that these men in the bible never did anything wrong and was always right in god's eyes no they was human living in situations in their lives they had stubbed their toes they had failed they had made mistakes but they realized that even when they made a mistake god would pick them back up again what was he doing he was preparing them for that oh he was preparing them he said what is it brother madam would say one place he says god is molding your character for what is coming to you what is trying to mold you and get you ready and i could see it's maybe the three children they would go down they had recognized daniel was their prophet so so many of us that's our problem we still don't recognize our prophets we want to say that we believe him but we really don't recognize it yet it hasn't settled in how do you say that because we question what he said what happened in our day we questioned and tried to go against everything that he said no i don't understand how did they come against the man how did they come against a man that was so vindicated of god how did they come against him how did they come against the word because the perverted of the evil one the evil one is always going to come against the prophets so that they stood in daniel's day daniel's the prophet of their day they had to recognize who the prophet of their day was they had to get under his teaching they had to get under his ministry they had to listen to the words that daniel said oh god help us we gotta listen to what the tates is trying to tell us he's trying to prepare us for battle but you know what we get all excited it's kind of like watching a football game we love it when the receiver catches 100 yard touchdown pass and everybody jumps up and down but nobody likes it when that guy's out there monday morning and he's running sprints what is he doing he's preparing for what's coming on his field he's preparing to get ready to do what he's paid to do to do what the talent in his body is to do he don't just show up one day so i'm here now i'm the greatest little man no he's got to prepare he's got a plan he's got to practice he's got to train you know god help us to see the things that we're going through in our life right now it's just the training ground it's just preparing to get us ready for that final battle i wanted to throw him good shooting would have stubbed their toe and set a cuff word if they'd just quit and just walked away and act like nothing had happened that had never been able to finish what god called them to do that had never been able to finish the first time i lost come upon them if they said oh i'm not worthy i can't go on but yet god had called them to a miracle he had coupled them to release them and bring them out of that furry pit what they had to realize this is another trial this is just something i'm going through children of god we got to realize as the bride of christ we are humans in this flesh we are living in these temples that are so craving of the world we're going to have thoughts we're going to have these hearts but there's something on the inside said yes but god said i was his bride even when i fall down i know to roll over on my knees and say god you forgive me of this you know in my heart that's not what i wanted to do what is it it's preparing me for god's battle you know what i don't believe for a second that when lucifer fell from heaven that it surprised god god knew what was going to happen he planned it out and set it up so that he would do it because he knew what was on the intent of the heart of lucifer and he knew that down through the ages it would be a battle every day of the life of god he knew for eternity down to this time not for eternity but all the way down through time he knew that he would battle this spirit of democracy he knew that he would battle this theory of a demon warfare he knew that he would battle this lucifer he would try to desmise all of his own blood but he also knew that he had us beside he also knew that those that he had called and placed in his hand his father said he'd never lose a wand why because he knew he was preparing them for their battle you know what it ain't fun it ain't fun sometimes going through the things that we go through and you know i'm sure if we could look back we could know it wasn't fun on the three hebrew children as they walked through their life being made fun of being mocked being told why do you believe that prophet daniel why do you believe what he says i'm following my king it ain't much different than it is today we get made fun of why do you follow that prophet why do you follow excuse me what is he says he said i'm following this new president no i'm following my god and my god said unto me a prophet for my day and he told me these days were coming and he told me that they would get more evil and evil or every day that we went on and he told me before that first bomb drops i'll call you home what's he doing he's checking my faith he's checking my abilities checking to see if i have what i really say i have i'm going through life and i'm fighting battles and every day just a bed of roses every day look i'm human just like oh i get up some mornings and don't want to work hey man i get up some mornings and wonder if i even love myself come on i get up some mornings you just wanna crawl up in a cage somewhere and everybody leave oh cause i'm human we get on the inside something says why don't you say prayer why don't you lift your hair and tell me you love me why don't you get you to leave for work and drop your hand on this everywhere and say god be with me today god help me today god's truth to me today god i don't know why these circumstances are in my life i don't know why these things but god you're preparing me for something you're preparing me for a battle that's coming god i want to be a good soldier i want to listen to what you have to say to me i want to listen and then even when i fall i can get up and try a little harder or was it babe booth in baseball he struck out more than he hit on runs but that didn't stop him from getting back up and hitting that ball again that didn't stop him getting back up and pouring into that fence and saying it's mine why because there was something in him in his training that he knew what he was capable of doing oh god help us as a bride to see something inside of us that we can see what we're capable of doing what enters god our doubt our disbelief oh god i i just don't think you could do that for me well until you change your attitude he probably won't because he's warned you to say god if you did it for the shin and my woman you could do it for me if you did it for my sister you could do it for me if you could save me you could save my kids if you can save me you can save my family why because you're the same god of yesterday today and forever and you say you look down through time and we ain't got enough time to go through all the notes i jotted down when i walk off and leave them we look down through time and we see each one of these examples in the bible they was given as an example to us but oftentimes we don't go back and read the bible of love to know they had issues we don't go back and read the bible enough to know that it wasn't always right we don't have enough you know you know time is a time thing now nobody has time to do anything look i just used it before i started as an excuse right we all use it but we don't have enough time to go back and read for ourselves that these were men of god that went through struggles that went through trial as god was preparing them for their final war i think of john the baptist here comes john the baptist look john the baptist was dead in his mama's room his life was over before it began but yet at the name of jesus he sprung to life why because god had something for him to do god had a plan for him to fight he had a battle for him to win and nobody else could do it god couldn't raise another man up he had done sin john the baptist the one crying in the wilderness he will announce my first coming it had to be i see the devil sneaks into the womb of elizabeth he kills jesus or he kills john the baptist he says yep got him now he don't have the one crying in the wilderness and god goes yeah watch this devil hey mary go see elizabeth hey mary tell elizabeth you're gonna have a son and you're gonna call him jesus and you know what mary did oh mary had hard times look mary had been made fun of they're pregnant before she was married she'd been made fun of she'd been ridiculed her own husband thought to put her aside privately she had been through her trial she had been through her disappointments she'd been through her problems but yet she had found a redeemer she had found a god she found an angel visitation to let it go i called you for this mary i will give you what you have need of and mary would listen walk to elizabeth and say hey elizabeth heard maybe you're having issues well you know he hasn't moved he's dead in the womb well i'm having a son and god told me to call his name jesus and that baby began to kick in the womb why because there was a plan that god had in mind for john the baptist to do and he had to fulfill that and we see john the baptist is he would come on the scene he would come up and he was the one crying in the wilderness he was the one they didn't want in town they didn't want him city they didn't want nothing to do with him he was an old wilderness man but yet he stood in that river and he says i'm telling you he's coming one day he's coming to one day make fun of him oh it kind of sounds like today if we stand up and say i believe in a rapture my god is coming back for me because i am a part of his bride oh you lunatic yeah there's been a lot of lunatics through time but let me show you the victims that they have because they always come out on top so john the baptist is standing in that river one day and he says you know what he's here he's here amongst us now there's one standing here that his shoes i'm not worthy look he didn't just get there he grew he was a child he become a teenager so he said it was his young people i tried to get to him and to see that you know what john the baptist he was a teenager at one time too he went through things he was a youth he tried to be persuaded to do what the world wanted to do he had friends he had school classmates he had everybody else like we do that tried to take him god taught him to do but yet there was something on the inside of you he recognized his lord and savior he recognized who he was he recognized the battle that was before him and god says i've already created it out i've already planned it i've already prepped you i've already gave you all that you need no i didn't send you to a theologian school i didn't give you the biggest degree in in business that you ever had i sent you to the back side of the desert so i could get along and talk to you i could encourage you and let you know this is what your job is oh god so much of us that's what we need tonight we need a backside of the desert experience we need to get along with god somewhere and let god open our eyes to let us see what god has in store for us you know once god spoke to him he'd become a very bold man it didn't matter how many tomatoes they threw at him it didn't matter how many apples they threw at him it didn't matter how many men they called him he'd stand in that riverbank and said let me baptize you into this man because there's a savior coming one day and one day he come and you this we go down and we find in the scripture that one day john the baptist realized it was over he realized that he had done what god called him to do and he makes a statement and he says now that i must decrease so that he can increase oh god help us to see we had a prophet in this day that brought a message to you and i he brought a message of a rapture to you and i he gave us the preparation gave us the planning he gave us the training he told us you want to get closer to god read your bible and pray he told you every step that you needed to take he knew how to cross the fence at the corner post he showed you how to dress he showed you how to live your life he showed you how to treat your neighbor he told you everything he prepared you he planned you he puts you in training on what you must do why because there's coming a day he must decrease some of the bride can increase why because it's god's plan it's his plan we're improving his word i want to read this brother brenda says i'm proving in his word he says but god he said in the midst of it all he raised up a prophet a son of a priest he's a never he said he went into the wilderness at nine years old he couldn't read his name it was the letter if it was a letter the size of a boxcar why why did he do it he was a prophet he if he had been trained in the education of his father he'd have probably been a pharisee or a sadducee or one of those groups but he had an important job there was to announce the messiah because why god kept his word and he proved it a voice of one crying from the seminary no he says behold i've got my doctrine and screen no he said that might be the old lady's birthday almanac but not in god's word you know it sense of humor you know what he's trying to tell us all of this is a bunch of nonsense that we try to infiltrate in the message all of the you remember if we go back to exodus and we see that the people of israel are captives and their slavery in egypt and it's time for them to leave god tells them don't take nothing with you you can't take nothing from this world with you to where you're going you're going to a promised land you're going to a place that i prepared for you you don't need your things anymore you don't need your ideals and your creeds anymore i have everything in place hold on a bride tonight he's done the same for us he's prepared for the battle ahead of us he's prepared us for the place that we're going to he said everything aside he said little bride forget your denomination ideals forget you didn't humble no priest forget what you think that the world knows forget what business don't you but put your trust in my word because i have what you have need of look one day you're going to stand to the greatest battle of your day and that business degree ain't going to help you fight the devil little guy i've got a degree i'm not throwing off on degrees i've got a degree took me a long time to get it because i ain't smart but i got a degree and i'm pretty proud of it i mean because it took a lot of hard work to get that degree but i promise you when the devil's tempting me with things that i know is wrong it doesn't help me to flash my degree into when i got a business he don't care he don't care how much i know it doesn't prompt me to to flash a quote and say well i believe the prophet he don't care he believes the prophet he believes this message he knows this message is true more than most of us know that it's true he realizes the plan that god has placed against him he knows that he's not going to win but he's a good adversary he's going to keep fighting but i promise you this when i stand there before that trial and i forget my degree and i forget about what i know and i forget about the quotes that i've memorized i forget about the scripture that i've memorized and i forget about the studies that i've done and i say oh god i'll let you speak for me because your scripture says in those times just hush because i'll speak for you and i guarantee you that when i sit there you know what happens god begins to speak through these lips you mean he speaks oh yes he speaks through these lips and the devil knows he's in trouble listening to brother brethren at the end the angel of the lord is there brenham is in in in full mode of of surrender to the holy spirit and all of a sudden god begins to speak through brother branham and he makes the comment this is not william branham why because you know what brother branham come to the point that he laid everything he had aside he laid all of his thoughts aside and he said god would you come in and would you take control and god looked down amongst his people and he saw the battles that they was facing he saw the temptations that they was facing and he said let me speak to him for a while let me tell them like i told moses i am the i am you've noticed moses says i am he wasn't saying i am moses i am the god of moses he begins to speak to us what is he doing he's building our faith he's bringing us to a place that we can now face that battle i think oh god episodes he says we come down to our prophet our prophet in this day come into the land come in born under a sign he cut and born under a light in the room vindicating who he was vindication after vindication he went out to the tree and the world went in the tree his life was surrounded by supernatural things why god had a special gift for him he had something for him to do just like john the baptist he had something for him to do wasn't always easy see that problem he lived in america in kentucky in the 50s 40s 60s and we can remember back wait a second brother brenham had faults well yeah moses had false come on come on john the baptist had false noah had false look they all had faults because they was human but yet they all had the ability to get themselves aside and say but god you have prepared this for me you said in your scripture that can come upon me that can overtake me why because you live inside of me you have in your scripture he that began a good work and you shall finish that work you know god if you've brought me out of denomination it brought me from the drug lords it brought me from the prostitute you're still training me and nobody likes training i know you know often i use the boxer mentality one time as as i did some reading some research on different great boxers of their day and you know you take one of these great boxers and and they know that they've got that fight ahead of them you take an evander holyfield you take a mike toss and you take you do you take different ones and then was in my day whatever was in your day they knew they had a fight ahead of them they were so zeroed in on that fight it didn't matter if a bomb dropped beside their car it wasn't going to bother them because they had a mission to accomplish oh god the bride of christ needs a desire like that we need a mission-oriented mind in our heads in a mission-oriented desire in our heart to say god you sent me for a rapture it doesn't matter what happens around me i'm going to that register why because i'm focused on the battle for me i'm focused on what you have for me to do god i'm focused on what you have for me to overcome i'm focused for the victory that you have for me because i know it myself i can't do it but with you all things are possible you think brother branham that she says his first instance is that he talked about going to the baptist meeting and he had his overalls on and they wanted him to get up and speak why because even them could see there's a gift in that little boy there's something shining out of him he's got something to say and oh god he's got a lot to say but what was it he chucked him down he goes down and god begins to preparing god begins to build him up oh yeah during these times he lied oh yeah he tried to cheat oh yeah he tried to kill somebody he tried to do all of this he was human but yet he was still a prophet sent god and god still had something to do for him we bring him along brother brennan would make one comment talking about the ohio river he said it was one of my greatest one of my first greatest meetings he said he's standing down there in that ohio river and he said that cloud opened up and that angel spoke as john the baptist first fought for him brother and the first coming so shall you four around the second running why because he had that battle for him but yet that wasn't all he was to bring a rapturing message to a bride and you know what if we don't do nothing with it now it would be like the hebrew children walking up to the fire and saying no i don't think i want it and walking away come on it would be like david walking down and picking up the stone stepping across the creeks and helping up he's too big for me and walking away it would be about what's trying to do because god knew we was going to face battles god knew we're going to go through things that's bigger than us that's bigger than what we can comprehend it's bigger than what we could understand i preached a funeral yesterday and and i don't know i i didn't even hardly know the man he married my he was my great-aunt's first husband before i was around with the family and they wanted me to so i tried to help him and be with them and when i preach a few i don't put them in heaven or in hell that's their life they do that but i told him i said you know what the only real peace that i have is in him the only way i don't have answers for your question i don't know why that that all of this had to transpire and you had to lose your daddy you had to lose your mama you had to lose your son your daughter whoever it would be but i know it's in the plan of god i know he's in control i know he won't put nothing upon us that we can't handle i believe that our prophet believed and i believe that's what he tried to teach us he tried to plan he tried to get back away he tried to go back to that cave and meet that angel and see what god had to tell you and how he had to try to tell us that there's a battle coming you're not just gonna just walk away like a breezy little happy two-faced kid and just go somewhere it's gonna be a battle you're going to have to stand for what you believe in you're going to have to stand for what put your trust in you're going to have to say god you've prepared me for this battle i'm willing to take whatever comes why because god has planned this battle he's playing this battle for you and uh and sometimes we as humans just like every example that we could use tonight just like every man in the scripture just like every prophet there's ever been what is it just like each and every one of them there was times in their lives that they may have got distracted oh samson did didn't he oh simpson knew what he was doing simpson knew that nazirite val from his birth he knew exactly what god had called him to do he knew that all of his strength was right there got distracted because of a good-looking woman god help us some of us boys we don't get distracted because of a good-looking woman help us to see these are examples for you and i why because the devil is using the same tactics that he's always used to try to bring your attention away from the word of god i believe all of these men went through times of depression i believe all of these men went through times that they doubted who they was remember we're just quoting scripture it's in your bible john the baptist laying in a jail cell begin to doubt is he really the one did i just mess this all up did i prophesy over one that's not even the christ is is he really the one remember that's what your scripture says he calls his own disciples and he says go seed him see if i'm right i'm so discouraged i'm laying here i'm laying here with burden on me i'm laying here in a trial i'm laying here at a depth door and i don't even know if i'm right anymore let's be honest we'll all get there sometimes we all get oh god the devil sneaks in and puts thoughts on our minds do you really believe this message yes devil i really do but let's be honest we have to fight them battles because them thoughts come brother breton says them thoughts will always be there just don't let them build a nest and become part of you what is it you start dwelling on that no wonder people turned from their prophet in their day no wonder people bowed in an image when they knew that wasn't the word of god no wonder people crucified jesus on the cross no wonder they come down their time doing the same thing they allow a thought to build a nest after you think about it some you know you start reasoning a little bit and yeah you know if i just kept that you know if i go get the new testament version the new english standard it don't even have that scripture in there so i'll just ignore that scripture and we start reasoning the word of god right away from us but if you tell that thought it's thought i have no part in you devil get behind me i'm sure as they could they took their hebrew children and they began to walk towards that the human brain in them told them that fire was hot that they didn't walk into it not knowing what they was walking into they had seen fire consume things they had seen fire burn people they had seen what that blaze could do and then the king just ordered it seven times hotter it's going to be hot they said oh king we're not careful to answer thee our god can deliver us but even if he don't we're going to serve him anyway little bride even if god don't take me in a rapture i'm going to serve him anyway even if god gave me everything that i that i want because that's a problem i want i'm going to serve him anyway even if i don't have the finest house even if i don't have the finest car even if i don't have the finest suit i'm going to serve him anyway because he chose me to worship him he chose me to serve him he chose me for this battle he chose you for this battle and look god don't lose y'all let's be real plain he don't lose yeah i mean you think trump's a sore loser you ain't met god yet he don't know what losing is when he sets out to do something he's going to do it when he tells the devil you know what devil i'm going to let you kill my son but i'm going to use his blood to redeem the earth he's going to do it why because he's god and he never loses a battle he never loses a fight he's always the forefront of everything that we have made of he's looking at you and i tonight and he's saying oh you're everything you know you don't want let's just throw this in here for the fun of it covert ain't nothing but a bunch of fear i didn't say it wasn't real i didn't say it wasn't a sickness but it's trying to attack your minds to get you so scared that you won't even serve god that you put that above reading your bible you put turning the news on above praying to god you put listening to what politics is doing above what's happening right before your eyes it's nothing but a fear tactic before god oh my gosh ahead of myself oh my let's just give them down you love him tonight brother brought him in the message influence he says now i wonder if it would take the same influence on us this afternoon he said if we'd seen what he promised to do in the last days fulfilled what kind of influence would he give us what he said all we have done in these last days ought to put us in action it sure ought to with reverence and humility he said now notice he said the pillar of fire should put us in action as the pillar of our vindicates its promise in the last days but what's happening we're turning our eyes from the word we're turning our eyes for the message we're turning our eyes from our pastor we're turning our eyes from our brothers and our sisters we're turning our eyes from church and we're focusing so much on the news we don't see the pillar of fire anymore why because the pillar of fire ain't on seeing in a fox it ain't on capitol hill it's inaugurated president it ain't in the doctor's office as they as they're treating kobe think that they're trying to do the best they can but that's not where the pillar of fire is the pillar of fire is in his word his filler fire is in his people it's sitting there saying this battle you shall overcome too this battle you will be victorious i know what's before you i know what's coming i prepared a way of escape for you notice the pillow fire should put us in action as the pillar of fire vindicates its promise of these last days jesus says i come from god and i go to god and he said what he would do in these last days see what is it he's told us everything that will transpire you know we could be here all night and i could scroll down here and i got another study in here of prophecy for the last days and we could go down and we could see all the abomination of god we could see how the world has turned against god we could see how government has turned against god you can see how this nation turned down god back in the 50s and they've never been the same since and it was all prophesied to us it was all owed to us by god through a prophet in this day to let us know don't be dismayed when these things happen well but i thought that's the problem you thought see my problem is i thought it's like i was sharing with brother david back there i've got a couple opinions and a couple thoughts about what's trend iron but i don't have to set the lord on it so i'm not speaking it as a friend we can talk about it it's for me but when i come up and minister the word of god i don't try to put quotes together and try to make things appear that that's what it is god don't need me to fulfill his prophecy he just needs me to believe what he said he just needs me to go back and say god you said through your prophet this day would come i see it transpiring prophecy in the days of daniel of handwriting on the wall oh a bunch of foolishness there ain't no way a hand can appear and ride on a wall but then it began to happen and you know even though it was happening if we if we just think on a human scale even though in that day there was many people sitting in the room and that hand appeared and began to ride on the wall there were still those that didn't think it was happening sitting right there watching it oh god help us we got so-called message believers watching the signs of the time happen right before our eyes and they're going oh i don't know if i believe this or not well the problem is you ain't seeing the pillar of fire because the fire is moving in the government it's showing the government what he needs them to set up so that he can get us out of here he's in control oh he said they should influence us put us in action he said signs of the coming is at hand jesus says as it was in sodom just before the world was burned the gentile world the world would turn it should influence us and put us in action too when we see the word fulfilled that he promised it should put us in action he should put us in action yeah it should make us live better than we've ever lived it should make us pray more than we've ever prayed it should make us read our bibles more than we've ever read our bible it should make us listen to more tapes than we've ever listened to it should give us a desire to be in church more than we've ever been in church why because there's something on the inside that's crying out for the seed of god it's crying out for that reverence that's crying out for that presence they can only be felt in the pillar of fire and you know what no wonder brother branham said when it comes to the rapture when it comes to this last day no wonder he says it'll take the people to get desperate it take us to get desperate god help us if not everything's happening it's turning the true bride back to god it's turning the true by deeper to the word than she's ever been it's turning the true by deeper to revelation than she's ever been why because our eyes are open to the fact that signs of the time are amongst us the handwriting is on the wall this is the time for rapture god has pre-planned this whole battle he has set it all into play and he's prepared us for this battle i just don't know how i'm going to do it you're not going to do it you're going to find a little prayer closet somewhere when you realize like i said to my woman in memphis she done prayed all she could pray she done did everything for that boy that she'd do and she realized god where's your lodge yet because i need you elijah and he shook the very foundations of heaven and god had to stop a plane in midair and send us elijah straight to her doorstep why because that's what our prayers do it'll drive us in desperation until we find that prayer closet in our life that we get down before god and say god i don't know why but in my mind i fear this sickness in my mind i fear this presidency in my mind i fear what the government's gonna do god i need your elijah in my day he sends his holy spirit right into your root you begin to feel peace come over your body why because he's prepared you for this day he says if you have not because you asked not i asked in prayer god oh i asked in prayer philippians 4 13 i can do all things through christ that strengthens me amen i was looking for one more mark 16 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that they believe in my name they shall cast out endeavors that's what you can do it doesn't take a minister to cast a devil out it takes a born again filled with the holy ghost son or daughter of god that knows who they are knows where they stand and knows their god is real and knows that no matter that fire is seven times the heat i have the ability inside of me to overcome that flaming fire why because my god resides in me and when i face that demon when i face that devil before me and my flesh i make fear in my flesh i may know not what to do but that inside man of me is going to rise up and it's going to speak for me and say devil get behind me because i'm not scared of your tactics because i have him on the inside they should take up servants if they drank any deadly thing it shall not harm them they shall lay hands on their sick and they shall recover you know i heard brother brennaman this just come to my mind i'll just share it with you listen i think it's three believers i'm not sure list 63 three kinds of believers or go go wake jesus one and brother branham begins the sermon by saying i've tried and i have failed to teach you that you don't have to come up here and me lay my hands on you for you to be healed said healing isn't the word look look you know and then he said and i agree with him now we do these things because scripture says lay hands upon them and they shall be healed he said but he don't take that what is he trying to tell us he's trying to build us up he's trying to prep us to know that one day we're going to be all alone driving down the road in our car and we ain't going to know what to do we're going to be so stressed out and we're going to be so mentally drained but yet he's going to tell us what can you do i can call on the name of jesus i can say jesus come right with me a while jesus come give me peace like you've not given before i don't have to run through enough physical alter i don't have to run and get a minister lay their hands on me i don't have to do this what can i do i can find someone that's got faith that agrees with me i can find that faith on the inside of me and say i believe thy word i believe your stripes was for my healing i can be healed sitting right here why because my faith is in his word oh my is it us now we look through god's great battle plan and we find down through the ages he had a plan for every battle and he overcome every enemy you say but they hung him on a cross he had a plan for that he rose him in three days and he sent him to hell and he stripped the devil of all of his power why because he had a plan for that he said but you don't know my life you don't know the situation that i'm in you don't know the sickness that is upon my family you don't know you don't know what the government is saying to me you don't know what my work is do to me no but god does know and he knew before the foundation of the world and he's got his pillar of fire he's got the holy spirit for you and he said just ask i'm holding the angels back i'm standing up here because i'm a gentleman and i've got all of the angels behind the arms children if you would just ask for it i would release the angels upon you they would minister to you healing they would minister to you faith they would minister to you peace they would minister to you joy well let's just be honest and i probably need to close let's just be honest in the day that we're living in it's hard to find happy people man you you find somebody happy and you just won't hang around no more look i mean speaking of me i don't like to hang around people that's always complaining all the government's going to do this they're going to take my guns they'll they're going to do this they're going to close the church doors no no i want to get around people said you don't want my for my yesterday i didn't know what to do he told me which way to turn you know i didn't know how to pay the light bill but you know what god sent somebody by and gave me what i needed to pay the light bill i want to be around people like that i want to be around people like this i thought i was a backslider i thought i was going to hell but god come into my life and showed me i am a son or daughter of god that's what god done for me i want to be around people like that i want to strive to be the best christian i can be i want us to drive to be the best example i can be i want to strive to holler out to a bride and i don't mean to scream it's just my nature i just holler and carry on like a fool i guess but the scripture does say it by the foolish of preaching but it excites me to see oh if i could have a vision like a prophet and i could slide up and i could look down upon the earth and i could begin to see maybe as god is sitting up there and he's orchestrated this whole battle plan he's been all in the play he knows what tomorrow it's i don't but he does that's why i don't fear it that's why i sing that song i don't fear what tomorrow holds because i know who it says he's sitting up there in his heaven sitting on his throne and he says yeah i've about got that bride where i want her i've got this from me i've about got her to the place that she realizes i'm the only one she has need of oh and i can see happiness come across his face he said oh god he said oh i've waited for this for so long before the foundation of the world i knew this they would come i knew 2021 would come i knew people would be so scared and people would be crazy and olympics and corruption it would just be falling apart but i knew also that there was a bride called to fight that battle and i knew that when these things would happen she would see the handwriting on the wall she would see the signs of the time and she would say god even so come quickly even so come quickly oh god brad it's your battle now oh i could see maybe days or weeks before daniel knew as a prophet what the three of her children would go through i could see daniel bring him in under his arms and begin to pray for him oh you believe that yeah kind of the same way jesus did before his crucifixion and he looked at peter and he says peter do you love me peter do you love me what was he doing he was giving him a way out he knew that peter would deny daniel knew this trial was going to be hard but he also knew the god they served and he prepared him for this battle little bride we could open our eyes tonight and see all of heaven has prepared us for this battle i'm not talking about a physical battle i'm not a i'm not a terrorist crazy new dick that wants to go storm the capitol i want to go storm heaven's gates it's what i want to go storm i want to leave this old flesh body behind i want the real me to escape out i want the real me to look around and see my loved ones that have died and going on start appearing before me and my mind knows that the scripture says the dead in christ your eyes first it's time to go home i want to stand and say even so lord you've chose me for this battle no matter how hard it is no matter how hot them blazes are no matter how strong them temptations are no matter how strong them influences are in my life i want to stand for you why because you called me for this battle the man musicians would come it's wednesday night i'll go on and on and on why brother brandon says if that bride ever recognizes who she is she'll become an invincible army amen against the devil and all of his tactics why because he's already saw that do you realize how exciting hey look some of you some of you some of you may be football fans okay we got what three weeks four weeks whatever it is to the super bowl we're down to four teams we have a super bowl would be nice if you already knew who was going to win before the game even played but see that's how my god is he knows that you're going to win he has already seen he's already predicted it he's already prophesied it he's already called it to be his bride he's going to win she's going to overcome she's going to overcome the demonic tactic she's going in a rapture she's going to be the one that he's called her to be and now it's up to you and i to open our eyes and say oh god that me amen amen you've got us all we're seeing stand with us you believe that tonight but branham says that angel come to and says you speak it and i'll perform it amen amen
