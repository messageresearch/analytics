be at amen praise the lord god bless you all amen praise the lord it's amy good to be back we had a wonderful time amen and so anyway um i can't think of any announcements other than i think we're supposed to be having some more rain coming in this weekend as far as i know so we'll probably put it off till next weekend again the following as far as i know on on sealing our driveway amen okay so i uh been wanting to go in a certain direction with us with a thought and i begin to go down that way and and it kind of veered off so we'll just see which way the lord wants to go is that all right amen uh sometime i wanted to do a recap or a review i mean preach on a review on a lot of the things that we've ministered on the last several years and take some of those subjects and ask questions about it and just kind of look at it again and and kind of have a quiz on it you know it's what i wanted to do and maybe just have a review kind of to see what we've learned you know right amen because you know if you don't remember what you learned you probably doesn't do you much good amen but anyway um kind of went in a different direction so we'll just see what the lord will have tonight but amen let's just bow our heads and go before the lord in prayer lord jesus we come before you father once again thank the lord jesus to be assembled with your children the blood thought of your calvary and the price that you have paid lord to be able to speak to them lord jesus we know that that's a real honor and a real things of reverence lord and respect father we really appreciate it and lord we do i remember a special way father brother al tonight god that you just raised him up we know he really does need a touch from you lord and lord the same with brother shawn father we ask god that you touch him lord in a special way father knowing god they're not feeling well the lord they just need your healing gordon may they claim your healing may they just believe that they buy your stripes they are healed and begin to claim it and go forward with that lord for we know that it's all by faith father lord tonight we just ask god that you come and speak to us along the way lord that our hearts might burn within us as you speak to us lord we want to ask god that you just use me father for your honor for your glory lord tonight again minister twist the word of life that we might go here go from here a better people than what we've come we ask these blessings in jesus name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will to second peter ii peter amen like i said again my mind has been towards doing kind of a review think about it and reviewed of course we all understand what that means that's just to look at it again to look at it again and so this is the scripture that came to me when i began to think about that ii peter 1. now there's there's peter's what do we want to call his take so to speak on on review and remembering and then there's paul's that i want to take tonight with the help of the lord that's found in first corinthians i think is the 10th chapter and we'll get to that in a minute but let's read here first second peter 1 and verse 5. and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge excuse me and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brother kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh thee things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your callings an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance amen knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ has showed me over i will endeavor that ye may be able after my deceased to have these things always in remembrance amen may god had his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated so my first question to you tonight is it says that he that lacketh thee things in his blood and he's blind and cannot see afar off so we see that a person that doesn't have the things in that right that they don't they don't have these what is the purpose what what caused them to not have it amen what happened that he doesn't have these things well it says he that lacketh thee things can't seem far off and hath what forgotten that right he has forgotten that he was purged from his old sin so this is not just somebody that's a sinner right this is somebody that once was cleaned up once knew what it was like to have his sins remitted amen but yet he lacks these things one and first thing i want to want you to understand here is that peter begins to explain and and he wants to uh wants us to basically what we might say that he wants us to grow amen how many knows that our the whole our whole christian walk is a walk of growth amen it's always about growing amen and peter says that we're to add all these things to us and if we don't and if we don't if we lack these things amen then we cannot see a far off we're blind and we have forgotten that we have been purged from our old sins so now peter is very concerned about this because i think if we would ask and brother david was mentioning it that especially it seems like the older that we get the more forgetful we've become amen for example today i had all my things all wrote down right had all these things wrote down and when i got to church i realized i forgot my notes and i don't know about you but uh today i was mowing the lawn you know i was doing the lawn taking a little break and you know and and and boy i tell you that thoughts just begin to come and i middle of my lawnmower i stopped the engine and i said if i don't go wrote this down i'll never remember so i'll stop that more i'll run to the house and and get a tablet and i'll write all that stuff down you know and and then i'll give me a tablet and the ink pen and stick it in my pocket you know and go out there and and whenever the lord just begins to pour it out all right that's thumps down well it doesn't help you much if you don't bring your tablet right but we're just very i don't know about you but we're very forgetful prone and i i'm more so i guess i probably uh i don't want to diss myself too much here but i am forgetful above average we got another one think that you know it's just above average i mean it may be average to be forgetful but i just tell you what sometimes i think that i'm just above average forgetful it's terrible i don't like it amen but anyway and no doubt that peter knew that we're forgetful he knew that humanity is forgetful the first church they were forgetful amen and so boy peter really expounds on it he says you know i'm not going to be let neglec negligent he says to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the even though you know it i'm still gonna remind you again i like that that's peter's type of preaching isn't it now i know y'all know this but we need to go over it again why because we have a tendency to forget i have another question for you tonight you ready all right what are the two best schools raise your hand sister hannah you might have had it hard yeah that's what i'm looking for the school of hard knocks we've all heard it at school right it is a great school because you know we can preach it all day hello but you don't really learn it just from preaching you know you have to and i call the other one the other school is the school of experience right you know the school of experience because hey when you get you know and be really when you think about it the way that we learn the best is not from a lot of times the things that we succeed in but in our mistakes in our failures you know right sometimes our failures are our best teacher all right how many knows and this just came tomorrow comes to mind um was it james thomas edison is he the one who created light bulb thomas says right i mean i'm told that he would try a thousand different things and thousands of different things he tried to make it work now i don't know about you but that's a whole lot of failures right but it taught what did he teach him he taught him that this isn't right this isn't gonna work all right let's go on to something else and that's the way it is in my life that's why it is your life when you fail at something you realize hey that's not gonna work all right let's try something different now because that didn't work insanity is to do the same thing expecting different results when i think about this subject let me just say something else while i'm at it and that is another question for you what happens to those who don't learn from history or the past you know we've gotten a bunch of sounds here y'all a lot of them you're bound to say make the same mistake isn't that right and that's the way it is in your life that's the way it is in my life if we don't look from our mistakes if we don't remember am i right and that's why we do sometimes we we do things over and over again is because we don't remember hey last time it didn't work huh and then we do it again and then we do it again how many knows that was the church ages the church ages brother bam talked about how that you know every time did every revival oh the people got free they get them we're getting out of their old dead churches and all that get the fire going in their hearts again and boy they were just happy and free but it wasn't no time until they were like a dog turned to its vomit according to james we human beings we're we can be like a dog that turns to his vomit all right and and go back to doing the same thing again amen so how many beliefs it's important to remember and then a lot of times you need to look back amen now we don't preach on looking back a lot because we believe in looking forward but there's certain things and certain things that you need to remember things that you need to look back on amen and do you need to bring back into your mind amen you know because the fact of the matter is um if if you lose your joy there's a reason why you lost your joy and you need to remember what is that you lost your joy because if you don't remember what it was you'll never be able to find it again oh my let me just reach a little little thing that buddha bam said about captain uh that was machine gunned and and he was dying his lungs were filling up and the chaplain he said to this man that was gunned down he says captain do you know god he said i once knew him and this is i didn't have much time to look this up but he says well when did you know him he said uh i can't think said where'd you leave him he said you'll have to go back to where he left him to find him and remember in another place brother bam said he was done he said i can't remember and this this this preacher was really mean and he was really hard on him he said yeah you better remember hurry up hurry up he said remember you're dying you only got a few more minutes and you're going to pass out he was just really hard on him you better remember hurry up remember well i don't know about you but that'd be hard to do i'd make my own motherboard nervous if i would die and he told me hurry up he pressed him he pressed this man you need to remember where you left him you need to think about back about where you left him at hallelujah come on folks how many notes oh my that's what that's for every one of us out there too if you remember well there was a time when you just had the peace of god and the joy of god and the love of god in your heart and boy it was just the greatest feeling in the world but today you're all mucked down huh you're not as happy as you used to be you're not what you used to be tonight you better remember the only way you'll ever get back to that place is to go back down memory lane and try to remember where you left him at otherwise you'll go on in your mind and amen got to go back remember where you left him that's what he was telling him he says your lungs are filling up sir you better think uh quiet and fast so he laid there a little bit and said and the great peace come over his face and he says i remember i remember where i left him and he said what was it at he says start right there and he says now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep if i should die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take he drawed his last breath as the gurgles of blood filled up his lungs and he died what did he do he found jesus right where he left him amen that's where the church will find him amen it's where you left him think back how many remembers there in uh revelations there and we're talking about the ephesus church the first church age he says you've lost your first love remember now where you fell from and go back and do the first verse huh go back remember amen i like that that's what peter was trying to tell them i want you to remember after i'm dead and gone i want to do something here he says knowing uh and i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by remembrance and that's my title tonight stir you up by remembrance praise the lord your mind how many knows your mind and your memory is it's quite a thing it'll either bless you bring joy to your heart or it'll bring condemnation and sorrow and despair is that right you know we've got several different young people starting up in church here i got to thinking about what i wanted to tell them and it really goes for all of us no matter what age you are it's a good time to start try not to make any mistakes don't do things especially that you know that's not right and do it anyhow because you'll regret it and you'll have a lot of regrets and the more you do it the more regrets you're going to have to have have as you get older hello and regrets are a horrible thing to live with amen because even though god is very forgetful god is forgetful i'm glad he's forgetful whenever your sins go into the blood of jesus christ he forgets but you don't the devil will try to bring those memories and those things and those failures back into your mind till the day that you draw your last breath if you can't he'll make you miserable with it i wish i had that quote brother by him said think right do right act right and you'll turn out right but if you do any of the others it ain't going to turn out right amen how many wants to remember that lord help us to remember amen praise the lord so he says now notice knowing that i must shortly put off this tabernacle he knew he was going to go away here because the lord had showed him that moreover i will endeavor that ye may be able after my deceased to have these things always in remembrance praise me to god whatsoever things are good whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are a good report amen if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on the things amen praise be to god because why tell me what you think about all day what do you think about all the time where's your mind at all the time and i'll tell you who you are because the bible says as a man thinks in his heart so is he folks you can hide a lot of things but do thoughts is what you really are amen my and i'm glad aren't you glad that we can remember go back and remember what god has done for you what god has done you remember the rock that you eschew from remember where he was amen now peter peter here when he goes to tell him what to remember he talks about this then he also talks about how that you know how that he was there when he heard that voice saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and we have not we have not followed cunningly devised fables we were there we saw he talked about his experience never forget that what you're following is not something false it's not some cunningly devised fable amen it's not what people want to say about brother bannon ministers that's been ministers for 20 years 25 years pastor perhaps they want to turn their back and say well brother branham was a false prophet huh say oh you want to we're not following some divinely cunningly devised fable thou's healings weren't fake that discernment wasn't fake that was not some cunningly devised fable when somebody wanted to trick him in the audience and congregation remember and wrote all that stuff on their notes and so forth and prophet says last night he was at a certain table you and somebody else and he uh yeah hello huh now we're not following some comingly devised devised fable but we're following the lord jesus christ i think it hooves us to remember what god has done how many knows that god is immemorial he is in some remembering things because even when the children of israel well there's many of them the feast of the passover was to be observed from generation to generation to generation so that people would remember what god did at that time when he delivered them out of egypt and when the firstborn was slain and when they had the passover lamb and so forth isn't that right he wasn't him to remember that this is the time that i delivered you you don't never want them to forget but let me tell you something about a forgetful people even if god said about them as they were forgetful and a stubborn israel was stubborn and forgetful amen so let's just follow israel for a minute let's go ahead and go let's turn if you will with me this is paul's version of how that we need to remember to me it is anyway and it's found in first corinthians the ninth chapter first of all in the verse 24 first corinthians 9 24 he talks about how to know you not that they would run in a race run all and so forth and then the last verse but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection at least by any means when i have preached with others i myself should be a castaway now look at where paul goes here where does paul go when he thinks about wanting to be able to finish this race is that right that what we're interested in he goes to israel and he says moreover brethren i would not have you to be ignorant how that all our fathers were under god how they all passed through the sea how they were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and they did all eat the same spiritual meat and they all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now deep things notice now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted in other words he said let's go back in mine let's remember what israel did and then how that even after god delivered them out of there on the egypt and he brought him right over to the red sea amen they got down and they got in that place of trial and they got into that place of past and that right they didn't know which way to turn they were basically going like what do we do what do we do what do we do what do we do i don't know what are we gonna do moses what are you gonna do what are you gonna do god let him get to that place and what did they do they forgot they didn't think about it what had just happened how god had brought them out isn't that right what god had done and how he had slain the first one how he forgot about the blood they forgot about the flag they forgot how they had shouted and sang and oh my and that right what a wonderful time they had and what did they do to begin the murmur oh my let me tell you something when we forget where we come from we begin to murmur we forget sometimes we don't think about where we were we're not content where we're at because we don't remember where we were folks when i think about where i was and now where i am you go ahead isn't it much better isn't it much better aren't you sitting in a much better place tonight than what you used to be [Applause] all right stir you up stir you up by remembering [Music] amen let me just tell you the story this is i think about this a lot and i use this at different times but remember the little beagle i picked up because god talks about israel and how did i found you in a waste howling wilderness wounded and bleeding is that right and that way pick her up i'll never forget coming back home and seeing that little big dog there in that swell snow covered sitting there skinny and i said there's something seriously wrong with that though to sit there no hope going to die [Applause] and never forget caleb you know the reason caleb told me not to pick him up because scale is the kind you know if you're going to give it 100 and not at all because when you get that dog he's yours for a lifetime you're responsible for him 100 you know how it is we went back and picked him up that dog being a strange dog allowed me with a broken leg straight sideways to pick him up and put him in the back of the truck with the lid on and so forth put him in a comfortable place brought him home take him to the doctor take him to the bed amen vet kind of want to cut his whole hang my ham off the whole leg's got to go i said i don't want to do that let's just fix it up and put it in the splint and if i have to shoot him later because he hobbles along and he has a miserable life i'll have to maybe do that but let's do that let's just put it in his plate and now when i think about it that guy is fatter than what he should be i won't even tell you some of the other but i'll tell you what you know he let me pick him up didn't bite me or whatever you know and what i think about that that was me amen in the world lost not knowing which way to go amen fixing to die so to speak no hope god came down and picked me up he picked us up out of the deep miry clay he took us to his hospital and he give us joy and give us peace he gave us happiness he would he tied up our wounds isn't that right he come to heal the brokenhearted oh my amen and that dog was so scared of me that he would urinate on himself wherever he was every time i approached him he wasn't used to people he sure didn't know what love was oh my i pet him and i said i'm gonna take care of you and i did all this talking to him you know and you're my dog now you know i'm gonna take care of you and isn't this nice this is nice i thought that's us sinners isn't that right isn't this nice isn't it nice to have the holy spirit to have peace when the world's falling apart and in our mind it bothers us because it's completely turning sodom and gomorrah world is falling apart but here in the midst we have hope we have peace we are in the nest of jesus christ safely tucked away amen aren't you getting to where you just about don't want to look at the news anymore it's too depressing i think we'd be better off just keeping that out of our mind amen when i when i think about the reality of how sodom and gomorrish's it's getting it's like wow this is just past me even wanting to know anymore just you know my but anyway so let's go back to israel here god brought them out picked them up they were mud dabbers made slaves of their sons and their daughters and did whatever they want with them beat them anytime they wanted to beat them whoop them whatever they wanted to do with it they did they were slaves and here's the first little thing that comes along and they forget all about her they're right amen and i want to say tonight that we repeat the same things over and over because we forget we don't think about it a lot of times amen we need to think about it we need to remember and then they come guess what and after that you know they god delivered them with a mighty hand through the red sea and it wasn't very long that he allowed him to get a little hungry and that right and then they begin to murder they forgot already look what god did they should have never had a complaint they should have complete faith in god and never he said my god is more than able they should and in that right isn't that what the joshua isn't that what caleb did at the cadiz barnea when they did it for the very last time remember when the spies came back and they had to go say remember what god did did god bring us out he's more than there but he tried to give it in their mind because us human beings we are so hard at it so hardheaded do you realize today that we know who pharisees is tribes are you know right we know who hypocrites are we know who they are we know who describes the pharisees of this they are but described pharisees don't because they don't learn from history amen it doesn't take it's very vivid it's very plain there but they don't see it and that's i guess what peter said if you like these things you can't see a far off and you have forgotten that you has purged from your old sins [Music] how many believes that if that faith and uh virtue and godliness and temperance and already things if they're not in you then you're not growing like you should be you're not fruitful like you should be in the knowledge of having him and claiming to be a christian you're not fruitful if those things aren't in you because you have come to the place that you're supposed to come to you have forgotten that you was purged from your old sins and even paul says these things are for our example that we shouldn't do like they did neither be idolaters as some of them were as it is written people rose up sat down to eat and to drink and to randy rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them also committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt us as some of them tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmury some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them for examples and are written for our admonition what so that we will remember remember what that just because you believe in the prophet just because you believe in the cloud just because you believe all of that that's not going to be enough just because you claim to be in the message that doesn't put the message in you i just don't want to claim the message i want the message to be in me and not just 20 years ago 30 years ago my mother had an experience back then no i wanted a fresh experience with god today [Applause] every day a fresh experience and i'll tell you you get away from prayer you get away from that commitment to god and you find yourself cold and backslidden but you need to remember where you left off serving god in the amazing that you did when you had the joy of the lord in your heart and come back to it the reason people never change you can come to church go about the same am i right because you might hear with your ear but you have to apply it to your life if you fail to apply it next sunday you might be enlightened well wasn't that a good service but you come back the next sunday or the next wednesday the same as you've always been huh think about it don't change now i don't know about you but change is hard for me change is hard for you you can try to change your colors all you want to you're just going to shine and brighter those spots you know but you can do something to change and that's pray more that's recommit yourself to god rededicate yourself are you with me now i'm saying that in a low voice but it should be penetrating our horrors how many's ever had to rededicate their self oh yeah we gotta rededicate we gotta get a refilling of the spirit a lot of times because if you don't get a refilling hello unless you're full you're completely full that's wonderful it's going to shine all over your face it's going to show but if you need a refilling it'll also show amen remember where god brought you from amen and where you are today remind me lord because i'm human i have a tendency to forget we we had great service at camp well why don't you have a great service tonight maybe you forgot something we come home from a revival we don't forgot oh i know that preacher was god no he wasn't all that good no because guess what i have felt like i have took totally flopped preaching well that was a flop of a message i really didn't never get off the air the ground never began to fly huh but somebody will come up and say brother bob that's the best message i ever heard that was really good i really enjoyed that so you see folks half of this about you and whether you get into it or not or where you're there with it or not or where you are at amen how many that's the way with our services that's because amen and when everybody gets where it's supposed to be then you'll have a good service but we forget how can i bring that revival here how can we have healings here amen if you bring god and you'll bring faith there the same thing happened remember peter said i want to stir you up by putting you in remembrance oh my how many loves good memories precious memories how they linger how they ever flood my soul in the stillness of my pillow i begin to think of how is god is so merciful and so great and so awesome and in the midst of the midnight my soul is blessed because i remember i think about god i think about what he has done i think about where he brought me from i think about all of his miracles huh all the times he's picked me up when i fell on my face all the times i didn't deserve forgiveness but he forgave me huh oh my other people might not even forgive you brother glenn they might not forgive you but god will forgive you human beings aren't as forgiving as god is aren't you glad for that i'm glad for a god that is full of grace and mercy or you wouldn't be performing that pew tonight you'd be at a tattoo parlor huh who knows where you would be praise the lord so he says notice so he says these things happen unto them as in the 40 samples and are written for our admonition upon whom the end of the world it says worlds no it does say world the ends of the world are come amen so we need to remember it wasn't just your experience with god yesterday that matters i mean believe that not just your relationship not just the fact that he brought you out not just the fact that he did what he did but what is he doing for you today amen what is your experience when god brings things here into your uh down your path so to speak what do you do with that when things happen to us we'll do two things one of them is and this is the normal reaction i will call it the first reaction our first reaction is to act carnally because that's just the way we are right the second one is to act intelligently right or spiritually if we how many know how many uh ever said the phrase on second thought well on second thought how many knows we need that a lot of times we need that second thought because if we say something or we do what we feel like or whatever folks especially myself we all have a tendency to have a foot in our mouth don't we but sometimes we'll take a second thought and we'll say no i shouldn't say that huh no that's not the right reaction because most of the time when we act initially a lot of times we'll have to apologize a lot of times we'll be saying i'm sorry right but we think about it we remember huh get a second thought about it get in the right gear then we can act correctly amen otherwise we have a lot of stories in our life we need to remember ah no that's just my first nature lord you take control of it if that israel would run that look at where they'd have been at they'd have been pleasing to god i don't know about you but that's my interest i want to be pleasing to him i want to be pleasing to him all right we got 15 minutes let's pick up my original thought a little bit i feel like i come to that spot amen just a couple questions things that we've taught over the years that i've taught that we've experienced so the one question tonight is you can raise your hand if you think you have to what are we here for what is this world to us what are we here for what's it all about pleasing the lord all right anybody else got something how many notices go ahead to be a light yes to be a light but what i'm looking for is that this world and the way god has allowed us to be in this fallen condition is for what it's approving and it's a testing ground i believe this is only a testing ground and getting us into what molding us and shaping us isn't that what a test do that's what like boot camp does it gets you ready for what's ahead [Music] oh my sometimes we forget that that's all it is sometimes we think this is our home this is where we live no it is not where we live it is only a temporary stay we're pilgrims and we're strangers in this place we're seeking a city where there's no amounts no sinners the sinner had refused to heed the call and that right it's a place of molding us and to the image of jesus christ question number two what is it some of the things that we preached so hard and so much on and that is about trials boy we've sure hamlet that haven't we tests and trials i've preached a lot of it because this church 10 15 years ago was not where it was supposed to be and god sent us trials he allowed tests to come upon us that shook us to our very core amen isn't that right [Applause] he saw so to speak beat us beat us what is the purpose of beating get the dross out of the gold we're like beaten gold remember what the prophet taught about character i already gave you the answer on that but god it beats us he allows us to be beat i don't know but i don't like really like meetings steer rough it is tough it is absolutely very little fun what did the bible say it endureth for a season it's hard for a season but it produces to reproduce eternal life i'm can i get off my subject just a little bit i want to tell you about our trip a little bit i'm talking to you about a good day and a bad day we had a good day we had a bad day and uh so we took micah's boat borrowed micah's boat i had to go up the rivers visit my amish cousins and so forth saying selena over there and and so anyway i got everything got my fishing tackle everything loaded up and that right got all the way to tompkinsville about two hours away pulled over the gas station to get a little something looked over in the boat and i realized that i had forgotten the vote key the vote key i forgot to vote we're gonna have a fun time paddling this thing bad day how my heart set you know you're just gonna but no i said no i'm not gonna i said my k micah call michael you got a secret key somewhere though to hit someone in this boat i know you got to no nope you got to come all the way back good i know i ain't doing that i refuse all right let me begin to look up marinas and marinas you know i'm gonna figure this thing out change the ignition i'll do something i'll run you 500 bucks dad nah there was a little old hippie dude there in the gas station and i said many marinas and so forth and i gave him a tip for give telling me about where everyone is and so we headed towards the mom says i'm going i'm 30 minutes from my location i'm going to go all the way down we're going to go down there and go up the other way a half hour i'm going to go past my place half hour the other way because i got confident we can fix this thing 500 bucks oh it is going to be expensive here and so we got down there we got to the city where we were going to stay at and i seen a gas station with a bunch of boats and ski-doos and some four-wheelers and just uh you know looks like a country hit guy that maybe fix this stuff so i went in there and i talked to them and i said hey you have any idea i told him my situation i forgot my key you know it's an older boat is there any way i can get ignition he says is there any marinas around he said he said well there's one way up there he says but this car quest over here might have it right this car quest around the corner has some boat ignition keys and mica's whole panel comes loose with six screws you pull it up and pull it off and and the ignition goes in there and you take one cap loose and you pop it off and there's about six seven different wires in there and that's way too smart for me hey i was thinking wow i was thinking screwdrivers you know anyway it ain't gonna work with six different wires but anyway so we went to car quest and looked at some and now that ain't gonna work and he says well let's come over here and come over here and he got me over there to that one and i took it apart and i looked at it and i said that looks like it let me take it out there and look at and it matched perfectly that was perfect match and micah's 500 turned into 27 dollars for the chef it was a glorious day we had a really good day that's a good day you know i just had a screwdriver and i did it myself just copied each one right off the bat and boom there we go we're ready to play here now right it was a good day everything you all worked out praise the lord kept my composure didn't get down too bad even though i was what did i call myself i don't even want to repeat it probably but anybody uh incompetent or something you know but that's a good day so anyway uh but there was another day then another day we was fishing and we was kind of closing the day out and we was going down there and i was going this big river and i was going to really catch some proud yeah i'm gonna gotta catch me a fish because i ain't caught one all weekend you know even though i you know don't catch one it's not all that bad in the hot summer brother jeff knows it's real hard to catch him in the summer especially totally blind because i had no depth finders or any of that technical stuff that i probably couldn't read anyway we was going down there and for some reason everything could go wrong went wrong and i was just throwing them lures on and we just current current going fast and you couldn't really you could stop and go back and get your lures but man i got snagged one after another reject i ripped it's loose that i just couldn't get it right you know and i was just fishing away and so one these the one time i pulled that lure back out of that thing so hard it come flying and come and stuck me in the leg i immediately went through the pants into the skin i couldn't get it out i said well i will fix it later i cut it i kept no bad day right murphy's law not everything goes right right oh yeah you heard it all again but anyway so we went on on down and once i got to the conclusion that i'm not going to get a fish and so we've seen the storms moving our tarts are feel like it's going to rain or whatever so it will go and this this river is foggy so trust me it was dangerous once again we had fall not where we were but around the band boy we got foggy and we was looking you know because man you're going pretty good clip and so anyway we got back to back to my wife always sitting beside me my little love bird anyway she's sitting there beside me you know and i had forgotten about this hook being in there and when i come up to where we was going to put the boat in and i was going to get up i got up like that and moved up and up towards the lake oh gosh it really hurts so we were really together we would really love birds but anyway i thought what what else then it started pouring pray the lord anyway right all right it'll try i thought i'm gonna tell the church might find a good day it's not a bad day ripped it out of mine i guess i realized it's just on my pants and oh i'm not hooked okay now i just cut that thing off and that's precious little thing i had to take the pliers and get it just right and quick you know did it quick it wasn't too bad we got it all straightened out got back in the hotel and everything praise the lord anyway but you you question i mean those you question sometimes you know what like i was a sin lord what i do whatever i did lord forgive me you know i like for things to go good and come together and so forth but you know and it all we just praise the lord you know that he watched over us because i'll tell you what it could have been you know with that fog and everything it was dangerous and everything you know with that fog and all so i thank god for his protection amen and how many knows like i think his brother brian talked about we have our highs we have our mountaintops oh my because you know before all of that happened when we was going me and her was just rejoicing because we we do despair at a moment more some spare moment going and leaving and go on a trip more when we were younger but we hadn't done in a long time but this kind of showed give us an opportunity to just get away a little bit and he says let's take it let's go ahead and just relax a little bit you know and and so but we was just singing and laughing and having fun on the way down until tompkinsville and then that happened and it was a little bit a little bit different until we got the ignition and then it was back to cloud nine again you know but anyway no matter what how many knows you just have to trust the lord commit your life to god and walk steady and don't let things bother you just if you possibly can and just always react in the way that the holy spirit runner wants you to react how many tonight would say lord help me remember the things of god let's remember everything that because god has done how good he's been good to us amen you take brother perish take me a lot of times we'll re-talk about our experience with god isn't that right because it means so much to us it inspires us to know what god has done and how he's sustained it's how he's kept it how he's molding us and how he's shaping us amen because you wouldn't really know you really wouldn't know what you are unless those hard times came amen and man is what he is what under pressure so god allows those times of pressure in our life to see how we react see what kind of attitude we take because ultimately jesus wants to live with people that are like him and that's what he we here at the church are striving for is to be in his very image allow god to change you don't make the same mistakes don't not learn from history amen because if you don't learn from history you're bound to repeat it god bless you let's stand tonight musicians if you'll come donna can you pull that song up that i mentioned i want to sing this song with you page 308 remind me dear lord yeah 308 let's go with the chorus first [Music] show me where he brought me [Music] again so remind me remind me dear lord roll back show me where you brought me from and where [Music] so remind [Applause] [Music] and the things that i love and how dear to my [Music] jesus only [Music] dear lord [Music] [Applause] every now and then show [Music] [Applause] [Music] and [Applause] [Music] nothing good have i done i had nothing good have i done to deserve god's all time worthy [Music] i said why they love me i can't understand [Music] and roll back the turtle and where i could have been [Applause] [Music] [Applause] remind [Music] [Applause] every now and then we'll be where you bought me from and where i could have been in love so remind me free by me thank you lord love him tonight with all of your heart he's been so good to us hadn't he and you know i always think of that and if we got what we deserved it would be hell but i'm so thankful for his grace and mercy and i went and picked up a car today and in the homestead and this young man i was talking to and we began to talk and he told me about his life and he was a convicted felon different things was talking about work and and he's talking about us talking about second chances in life and i said well you know i said jesus christ when he was crucified i said there was a felon around him and i said one of them said if you who you are you'll get us down and save yourself and us too and i said the other one you know i said he said i belong here but you don't and i said you know he realized what god had was was there by his side and i said he gave his heart to the lord right there and i said even though he died i said we'll see him someday and i you know i tried to tell him i said you know it's just by god's grace that any of us aren't and haven't been down that road and i'm thankful for god's mercy and in my life and i always think if if you ever want to know how bad of a person i is just go to arkansas and ask sister murder she used to tell everybody he'll be in prison before he's 20 but by god's grace and mercy he made a way you know and we're just we're thankful for his mercy and his grace and and he has to remind us sometimes of his goodness and but i'm glad he loves me aren't you amen and we just appreciate him tonight pray one for another remember the service sunday and man just pray that god will just come and speak to our hearts and you love him let's sing that little course as we go i love him better every day god bless you till sunday well i love him better every day oh i love getting better every day [Music] i
