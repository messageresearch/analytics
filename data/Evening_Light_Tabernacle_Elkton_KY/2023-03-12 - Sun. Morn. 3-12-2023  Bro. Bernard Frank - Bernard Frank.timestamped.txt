[3:02] okay children can be dismissed
[3:15] it is
[3:20] Psalms 9 3.
[3:40] 00
[3:42] yeah
[3:45] Lord granted he is clothed with Majesty
[3:49] the Lord has flown to his friend
[3:52] where was he encouraged himself the
[3:55] world also established that it cannot be
[3:58] moved
[4:05] let's have lifted up O Lord let us have
[4:09] lifted up their voice the floods lift up
[4:12] their ways
[4:13] praise
[4:21] the United States
[4:53] thank you
[4:55] yeah
[4:57] that's one of God chapters in the Bible
[5:01] I read a lot of my pages are all messed
[5:05] up but um
[5:08] by texting last night
[5:11] yesterday the uh we we got our insurance
[5:15] plan for for the water damage and the
[5:18] amount of 4 800 and change
[5:22] and they actually were pretty good to us
[5:24] they're hard to cut the boys
[5:26] honestly he thought
[5:29] being conservative so our complex
[5:33] what I actually had it up to so
[5:36] they asked me paid just a little bit
[5:39] more than what they should have paid
[5:41] with a thousand dollars deductible
[5:43] coming off
[5:44] on the top so I wound up to forty eight
[5:47] hundred dollars
[5:49] sometimes
[6:00] um I'm trying to find a spot to start in
[6:03] the 10th chapter here
[6:05] if I jump around you'll have the
[6:07] beginning this morning but uh I was
[6:09] reading some messages from the ministers
[6:12] that have been coming by the last
[6:18] they've been trying to encourage us
[6:21] to encouraging just me also to realize
[6:24] who you are in the Gospel of Jesus
[6:25] Christ this morning
[6:29] like ministers will tell you you're
[6:31] asking a living but he references that
[6:33] you have this morning you know then
[6:35] especially in this Tech chapter here if
[6:39] you realize who Jesus Christ
[7:03] I'll read this
[7:12] foreign
[7:18] but he did anything by the doors The
[7:21] Shepherd of machine the heaven the
[7:24] portal and the Sea bears for us now
[7:26] called his own Sheep by name and leadeth
[7:29] him out but when he put forth so she
[7:31] would be going before then and the Sheep
[7:33] follow him for they know his voice
[7:35] and that's what I was thinking this
[7:38] morning because that's what all these
[7:40] ministers have been trying to tell you
[7:41] God all he hears wow he
[7:50] this morning
[7:51] and he opens that door for you he's more
[7:54] than able to do whatever that name is
[7:56] this morning
[8:01] but they know not the voice of strangers
[8:03] but I I just can't encourage her enough
[8:06] God knows the voice he knows who you are
[8:09] he knows what your needs are he knows
[8:12] where you've come from and where he's
[8:14] going there's nothing different
[8:16] sometimes
[8:19] sometimes we don't think we're worthy of
[8:22] something or we deserve something
[8:24] hey his promises are for you no matter
[8:27] what you think of yourself
[8:55] [Music]
[8:59] said
[9:03] but uh in this chapter you have the
[9:06] Pharisees and the Sabbath Street getting
[9:08] around Jesus
[9:10] and the questioning him and Prodigy
[9:14] pushing him the to tell them who he
[9:17] really is and the way he tells them he
[9:20] is
[9:21] if he just speaks the scriptures to him
[9:23] and he likes this French to speak to
[9:25] themselves who he is and what he is and
[9:28] they just can't receive it they can't
[9:29] believe that a man that stands before is
[9:32] really the presence of God in front of
[9:35] him they just can't believe it but I'm
[9:37] going to start uh
[9:43] unto him how long does thou make us to
[9:47] death
[9:48] without being the Christ tell us coinman
[9:50] so they want someone to spell it out for
[9:53] them they want someone to actually
[9:55] happen
[9:56] basically you have to prove to them who
[9:59] he is but he was telling them that the
[10:01] things he was doing
[10:02] the testimonies
[10:04] are performed with blessing evidence or
[10:06] who he was so they still couldn't
[10:08] believe it now I just finished this
[10:10] chapter here in Jesus remember I told
[10:13] you and you believe not the worse about
[10:15] you in my father's name they bear
[10:17] Witnesses
[10:19] but you believe not because you are not
[10:21] a machine as I have said unto you must
[10:23] hear my voice and I know that when they
[10:25] follow me
[10:26] and I give Mom for them eternal life
[10:28] that they shall never curse people
[10:30] showing him out in Miami
[10:33] my thought of which gave them
[10:35] me is great at all no man is able to
[10:38] them out of my father saying that I
[10:40] should be a couple of thought going back
[10:42] earlier no matter what happens if you're
[10:45] God's hands there's nothing that the
[10:48] world can do your enemy can do or
[10:50] whatever it is that can you out of
[10:52] God I'm saying then he goes on saying I
[10:55] am my father are one and this is you
[10:58] know as you read all my gospels
[11:00] this is where they had problems
[11:03] where's yourself from the same person
[11:06] and he said that and you go to Simon and
[11:08] said then that you just took up stones
[11:10] to Stone and Jesus asked them
[11:13] that's a good work somebody showed you
[11:15] from my Father which of those works
[11:18] these stories are basically saying what
[11:20] are you starting before you see the
[11:22] evidence before you because of the Jesus
[11:26] for good works you still may not work
[11:28] for blasphemy because I believe us
[11:32] excuse me
[11:33] because without being a man makes myself
[11:35] God
[11:37] back from what I said earlier they
[11:39] couldn't realize who he was and Trust
[11:41] then Jesus answers him if it's written
[11:44] in your law I said ye are gods and whom
[11:47] if he called him
[11:49] God's on to whom the word of God came
[11:51] and the scriptures cannot be broken
[11:53] saying whom the father had Sanctified
[11:56] and sent into the world not blaspheme is
[11:59] because I saw him and Son of God
[12:01] if I do not the works of my father
[12:03] believe me not and he
[12:05] you know Jesus if you go for the gospels
[12:08] he's pointing back to a Elijah and all
[12:10] the other prophets and identifying who
[12:12] he is by the things he's doing and they
[12:15] spoke and believe them and he goes on to
[12:17] say
[12:20] I lost my question believe me not me
[12:23] believe the words and if you know I
[12:25] believe that the father is in me and I
[12:26] am in him therefore I start again to
[12:29] take him and to escape out of their
[12:31] hands and he went away again Beyond
[12:33] Jordan went to a place where John the
[12:34] first baptized and there are the above
[12:38] and many resorted onto him saying God
[12:41] did no miracles but all things that John
[12:44] spoken this man was true and many
[12:47] believed on him there so they wanted to
[12:49] talk about this just like we have the
[12:51] word of God and by the Endermans we
[12:54] believe he's 11 God now I was going to
[12:56] jump back to song here
[12:58] and I hope I got the right one
[13:04] too
[13:10] I'll just read this one and sit down if
[13:14] it psalmades you I'll give you a chance
[13:16] to get there this morning
[13:25] saying
[13:29] and it said God stands on the
[13:30] congregation of the Mind rejections
[13:33] among the gods
[13:36] how long will you judge unjustly and
[13:39] accept the person
[13:40] s of the wicked descended
[13:45] Justice to The Afflicted I need if I I'm
[13:49] not trying to be funny I was about to
[13:51] say something but it's I would say but
[13:55] deliver the war needed
[14:00] read them out on the documents of all
[14:03] the foundations
[14:06] I had said to your gods
[14:09] and all of you are children of the most
[14:11] desire but you shall die like man and
[14:14] fall like one of the princes arise of
[14:17] God and judge your medals inheritance of
[14:20] all Nations and I was just thinking of
[14:22] that this morning
[14:32] have these Buddhists
[14:34] our people in different directions that
[14:36] we're all having a discussion
[14:38] and there was all kinds of Christians in
[14:41] the audience and what struck me is what
[14:43] the food
[14:46] and the Christian's been bullied he was
[14:48] testified of the greatness of Jesus
[14:51] and the person that's been receiving the
[14:54] person but the Buddhist is saying that
[14:56] you believe
[15:37] but like I said in the beginning
[15:45] more than we're willing to
[15:48] willing to regard
[15:53] less
[15:57] with that this morning

[52:32] I like to greet each and every one in
[52:34] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[52:36] Jesus Christ
[52:38] and we're happy to be here this morning
[52:41] and thank you brother Tom for
[52:43] introducing my wife and all our friends
[52:45] that came with us
[52:47] and it's just a privilege to be here in
[52:49] the house of God
[52:50] and I said Thomas I said I feel right at
[52:53] home because I love like a small country
[52:56] Church you know
[52:57] because that's where I'm home in
[53:01] we know we don't have to go to the
[53:03] highest and fanciest places because we
[53:05] know the Lord meets us right where we
[53:07] are and that's what
[53:09] we're happy for today and yeah you
[53:13] mentioned there's no sometimes a friend
[53:15] just comes by when you're in the lowest
[53:17] point and brother Thomas yeah what you
[53:20] were going through at that moment that
[53:21] was just the Lord you know and and
[53:23] that's how it works we we just serve a
[53:26] living God he knows and works on both
[53:28] ends and many times we do things
[53:31] that we don't even understand why we do
[53:34] them but it's just the Lord and I said
[53:36] it in my church about seeing the man of
[53:39] God and the woman of God in the Old
[53:41] Testament
[53:42] they were never in the capacity to do
[53:45] their own will the things that they did
[53:48] that the Bible recorded was there to put
[53:50] it in there that God had to live them
[53:52] out his principles and I'll believe the
[53:54] same for us this morning we are not the
[53:57] we are not don't have ourselves will but
[53:59] we are there to live out the will of God
[54:02] for our lives that's what we're here for
[54:04] and
[54:06] this morning by the grace of God
[54:10] we would just want to magnify Jesus
[54:14] Christ
[54:15] now many people think that we can now we
[54:19] can't make him greater because he's
[54:20] already the greatest
[54:22] but what he can do for us is that we can
[54:25] see more of him that we can love him
[54:28] more that we can appreciate it more and
[54:30] we're just we're just happy people and
[54:35] you know sometimes you go to a place and
[54:37] you Minister and
[54:38] then after you haven't read a single
[54:41] quote people will ask does this man
[54:42] believe the message so I just wanted you
[54:44] know I'll believe the message I was
[54:46] raised in it and I can just say that
[54:48] without the message and the light of the
[54:51] hour we would have never understood the
[54:52] word of God how we can understand it
[54:54] today
[54:55] it's been just the key to open up her
[54:58] eyes
[54:58] of understanding that
[55:01] today we can read the word and it means
[55:03] more to us every day
[55:05] and I know how my friend brother green
[55:08] said he said when he fell in love with
[55:09] Sister Janice he said if there was a
[55:11] book about her I would have read the
[55:13] whole book
[55:14] and we're in love with Christ
[55:18] we love this book we we want to read it
[55:21] because we want to know more about him
[55:23] and I thought Thomas I have a saying
[55:25] that I say well Paul said you know some
[55:28] preach this some preach that some preach
[55:29] for gain some preach for that reason and
[55:31] then Paul says there's another point he
[55:33] said but I preach Christ and him
[55:35] crucified and
[55:36] and when it comes to where we are I say
[55:39] okay some people might preach the
[55:41] mystery some preach the Revelation some
[55:43] the private interpretations but this
[55:45] morning by the grace of God we want to
[55:48] preach Christ to you and him crucified
[55:50] that that is that is the main subject
[55:52] and that's what it's all about if what
[55:54] we do is not there to glorify Jesus
[55:57] Christ if that is not the center of our
[55:59] work our will of everything we do then
[56:01] we're in the wrong place
[56:04] it's not about men it is about Christ
[56:08] so in order to get started let me have a
[56:11] look at the clock it's almost 11 30 so
[56:13] we know we'll be finished in about one
[56:16] hour so whatever I say if there's
[56:18] something you don't like you can hold on
[56:19] it's not going to be more than one hour
[56:22] and you know when people make know that
[56:25] it's easier to listen to man that they
[56:27] don't like
[56:29] God bless you let us stand
[56:31] for the reading of the word
[56:34] and
[56:35] I want to read this morning in Exodus 21
[56:40] from verse one to six
[56:56] or maybe worth two to six
[56:59] Exodus chapter 21 verse 2 to 6.
[57:04] it says here
[57:06] if thou by in Hebrew servant six years
[57:09] He Shall Serve
[57:11] and in the sevens he shall go out free
[57:13] for nothing
[57:16] if
[57:17] he came in by himself
[57:20] he shall go out by himself
[57:23] if he were married then his wife shall
[57:25] go out with him
[57:28] if his master has given him a wife and
[57:31] she have borne him sons and daughters
[57:33] the wife and her children shall be her
[57:35] Masters and he shall go out by himself
[57:40] and if the servant shall plainly say
[57:43] I love my master my wife and my children
[57:46] I will not go out free
[57:49] then his master shall bring him unto the
[57:52] judges
[57:53] he shall also bring him unto the door or
[57:57] unto the doorpost and his master shall
[58:00] bore his ear through with an owl and he
[58:03] shall serve him forever
[58:06] now if we could turn to Psalms
[58:09] 40.
[58:11] and we want to read
[58:14] from verse 6.
[58:18] and
[58:19] those who have an NIV Bible you will be
[58:22] able
[58:24] to read what I read
[58:26] those that have the King James it reads
[58:28] a little different
[58:30] but here it says in Psalms 40 verse 6.
[58:35] sacrifice and offerings thou didst not
[58:38] desire
[58:39] but mine ears has thou pierced
[58:43] burned offering and sin offering as thou
[58:46] not required
[58:47] then I said lo I come in the volume of
[58:51] the book it is written of me
[58:53] I Delight to do thy will o God ye thy
[58:57] law is within my heart
[59:00] and I want to go back to to the reading
[59:03] where it says Antman ears has thou
[59:05] pierced I've checked it up in the
[59:07] original Hebrew text
[59:09] the text says my ears has thou dugged
[59:12] and many translators have translated in
[59:15] the way my ears have now opened but the
[59:18] digging is much more than the piercing
[59:20] is not opening and when we see those two
[59:24] scriptures together
[59:26] we can see that there is a connection
[59:29] here between the servant that we read
[59:32] out in Exodus
[59:34] and the Lord Jesus Christ whose Ministry
[59:36] is on display
[59:38] in this Psalm here and therefore the
[59:42] title of the message this morning is the
[59:44] perfect servant let's pray
[59:47] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[59:50] oh Lord you said in the book it is
[59:53] written of me and I've come to do thy
[59:55] will
[59:57] Lord will you come this morning and
[59:59] reveal to us that word
[1:00:02] as we try to take it out of the words
[1:00:05] from the book that you will come and
[1:00:07] reveal it Lord
[1:00:08] that you would speak to our hearts that
[1:00:11] we will have a greater understanding of
[1:00:14] your grace and mercy towards us and
[1:00:17] would you bless every heart this morning
[1:00:19] Lord every ear that hears and bless my
[1:00:22] voice that speaketh Lord let me be a
[1:00:25] yielded vessel we want to give you in
[1:00:27] all things the honor and praise in Jesus
[1:00:30] name amen you may be seated
[1:00:35] that's a very interesting scripture
[1:00:39] and
[1:00:43] the application of the scripture where
[1:00:45] it's let's go back to the law
[1:00:48] now we know that Israel was given law
[1:00:52] and the law actually
[1:00:54] was no different than the will
[1:00:59] and
[1:01:01] the nature of the law Giver
[1:01:05] see when God the law
[1:01:07] the law was not a law different from him
[1:01:10] but it was his law
[1:01:12] it was the expression of his divine
[1:01:15] nature in his will
[1:01:18] and God knew the spirit of man would
[1:01:21] always strive against God
[1:01:23] he knew that there was no man that could
[1:01:26] ever keep the law
[1:01:28] and he says in in Acts Jesus said you
[1:01:30] stiff-necked and uncircumcised and
[1:01:33] hardened ears you always release this
[1:01:35] the Holy Ghost as your father's Soul you
[1:01:38] do also
[1:01:39] and so we can see that that law that was
[1:01:42] given
[1:01:43] it was given for man to live by
[1:01:47] and it was the expression of the Divine
[1:01:49] being of God himself
[1:01:52] and that law was there to help the Jews
[1:01:55] to live their life
[1:01:57] socially
[1:01:59] spiritually morally it was the guideline
[1:02:03] that they should live by but actually
[1:02:05] the law was much more
[1:02:08] the law was a Divine expression of the
[1:02:11] thoughts of God
[1:02:13] and that was the absolute foreshadowing
[1:02:17] of the person of Jesus Christ
[1:02:20] now when he came to Earth he said I'm
[1:02:23] not here to take away the law but I'm
[1:02:26] here to uphold the law and I'm here to
[1:02:30] fulfill the law
[1:02:32] and therefore the things that we read in
[1:02:35] the Old Testament in the law many times
[1:02:37] we just read over them yeah that's the
[1:02:40] Old Testament that was the law that was
[1:02:41] for the Jews well
[1:02:43] true it was for the Jews but if we can
[1:02:46] see the way that the law was fulfilled
[1:02:50] in the person of Jesus Christ
[1:02:52] and that's why he said and I want to go
[1:02:55] back to Psalms so that we would not
[1:02:57] overread it and just not miss what it
[1:03:00] says in there
[1:03:02] but in Psalms 40 it says
[1:03:06] in the volume of the book it is written
[1:03:09] of me
[1:03:10] and see that's looking back to what
[1:03:14] already Moses had put into the law
[1:03:17] when David wrote this Psalm he was
[1:03:20] referring back to what Moses had already
[1:03:22] written in the book it was written of me
[1:03:25] and so Jesus came to absolutely fulfill
[1:03:30] this part of scripture
[1:03:34] now you say Jesus is servant
[1:03:37] and we know that the word that is used
[1:03:39] there in the Bible is actually more than
[1:03:43] just a servant
[1:03:44] the word actually means servant or slave
[1:03:49] I remember a servant might in a way
[1:03:52] sometimes still have his own will
[1:03:55] but his slave does not have his own will
[1:03:58] and we we're going to use the word
[1:04:00] servant because the word slave might
[1:04:02] sound a little harsh but we should still
[1:04:05] remember that the word being used here
[1:04:08] that its meaning is also being a Slave
[1:04:12] and if we now look to scripture and I
[1:04:14] want to read Isaiah 42 verse 1 we're
[1:04:18] speaking about Christ
[1:04:20] and here it says behold this is my
[1:04:24] servant
[1:04:25] I sustain him and my chosen in whom my
[1:04:29] soul is well pleased
[1:04:31] I have given him my spirit and he will
[1:04:35] bring out justice among the Gentiles
[1:04:38] and furthermore in Isaiah 52 13 it says
[1:04:42] behold my servant shall do wisely and he
[1:04:47] shall be exalted and very exalted
[1:04:50] so the scripture
[1:04:53] shows that the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:04:56] also was the ministry of a servant
[1:05:00] he came to fulfill the law
[1:05:02] and it's very significant the Bible does
[1:05:05] not say if you have just a servant he
[1:05:08] says if you have a Hebrew servant
[1:05:11] he had to be off the off the Hebrews he
[1:05:15] had to be part of that Nation
[1:05:17] and that's why Jesus came into this
[1:05:20] world through Mary which was of the
[1:05:23] Jewish Nation
[1:05:25] and he goes on further to say in Isaiah
[1:05:27] 52 we'll say sorry Isaiah
[1:05:31] 53 was worse 11.
[1:05:35] it says here because his soul has
[1:05:37] wrought he shall see his pleasure and
[1:05:40] have abundance and by his knowledge he
[1:05:45] my servant the righteous shall justify
[1:05:48] many for he Bears their sin
[1:05:52] now think about that
[1:05:54] the god of Heaven
[1:05:56] the creator of Heaven and Earth
[1:05:59] comes down to his creation to be their
[1:06:04] servant
[1:06:06] it's Unthinkable that the god of Heaven
[1:06:09] could stoop down in such a way that he
[1:06:13] became the servant of those
[1:06:16] that he had
[1:06:18] created
[1:06:19] and that's why the Bible says in
[1:06:21] Philippians 2
[1:06:24] verse 6 it said who though he was in the
[1:06:27] form of God yet thought it not robbery
[1:06:30] to be equal is God but emptied himself
[1:06:36] and took on upon him the form of his
[1:06:39] servant
[1:06:40] and was made in the likeness of another
[1:06:43] man and was found in the likeness of man
[1:06:47] and he goes on to say he humbled himself
[1:06:50] and became obedient to the point that
[1:06:54] this even this on the cross
[1:06:57] think about that and when I thought
[1:07:00] about this the song came to my mind
[1:07:02] where it says down from his glory
[1:07:06] every living story my God and savior
[1:07:09] came and Jesus was his name born in a
[1:07:14] manger to his own stranger a Man of
[1:07:16] Sorrows tears and agony
[1:07:19] what condescension bringing us
[1:07:21] Redemption that in the dead of night no
[1:07:25] faint hope in sight God gracious tender
[1:07:29] laid aside his Splendor stood
[1:07:34] to win and save my soul oh thinking of
[1:07:39] the god of Heaven laying aside his
[1:07:42] Splendor stooping to come down here that
[1:07:45] he was made lower than the angels to
[1:07:48] come to save you and me and to be our
[1:07:51] servant
[1:07:52] oh Hallelujah
[1:07:54] what a God we serve
[1:07:58] and he goes on to say without reluctance
[1:08:01] Flesh and Blood his substance he took
[1:08:04] the form of man revealed the hidden plan
[1:08:07] oh Glorious Mysteries sacrifice of
[1:08:11] Calvary and now I know Thou Art The
[1:08:15] Great I Am
[1:08:17] he came to fulfill the law
[1:08:21] oh
[1:08:23] he came to be a servant he came to
[1:08:27] deliver
[1:08:28] what a miracle of Grace
[1:08:31] God laying aside the greatest Glory
[1:08:36] and Authority that he had and coming
[1:08:39] down to greatest dependence
[1:08:43] Jesus was dependent
[1:08:46] when he was in the days of Flesh he
[1:08:49] became dependent
[1:08:51] when he was born as a baby he became
[1:08:54] dependent on Mary
[1:08:57] that she had to nurse him because he
[1:09:00] needed just as you and I he needed to be
[1:09:03] nursed
[1:09:05] just as you and I he needed to sleep
[1:09:08] just as he was I he became thirsty just
[1:09:12] like you and I he became sick because
[1:09:14] the Bible says that he was acquainted
[1:09:17] with sickness
[1:09:19] God coming down in the form of a servant
[1:09:23] making himself dependent just like you
[1:09:27] and I to come to fulfill the law
[1:09:32] he left aside all honor glory
[1:09:36] to take the suffering and shame
[1:09:39] I remember
[1:09:42] the Earth was subject to the devil since
[1:09:45] the fall
[1:09:48] but now
[1:09:50] the creator of Heaven and Earth
[1:09:53] he comes to the place of subjection
[1:09:59] when Jesus came
[1:10:01] that did not end Satan's rule here on
[1:10:04] Earth
[1:10:07] the Earth still till today
[1:10:10] is set to the root of Satan
[1:10:14] but now he comes here
[1:10:17] to even subject himself into that system
[1:10:26] well
[1:10:28] Satan
[1:10:30] was also created by God
[1:10:35] he created everything that there is
[1:10:38] so he created Satan
[1:10:41] he created the Fallen Angels
[1:10:46] but Satan was not able to keep his place
[1:10:53] he lost his place because he wanted a
[1:10:56] higher Kingdom
[1:10:57] yeah
[1:10:58] and from the time that happened
[1:11:02] Satan was always watching God
[1:11:05] let's see what is his next move
[1:11:09] then God made a man
[1:11:14] another part of the creation
[1:11:17] and Satan immediately asked himself
[1:11:21] let me see this one that God has made
[1:11:24] here
[1:11:26] will he be like me and fall
[1:11:29] or can this be a perfect man
[1:11:34] and he tried it out on Adam
[1:11:38] and Adam Phil
[1:11:40] as Satan mocked
[1:11:43] he tried it out on every servant of God
[1:11:47] and every one of them fell
[1:11:49] as Satan laughed
[1:11:52] but finally there was one that came
[1:11:57] that would not be deceived
[1:11:59] that would keep the father's will
[1:12:03] one that was able to fulfill the law of
[1:12:06] God
[1:12:09] and Jesus said
[1:12:12] do you not know I have to be about my
[1:12:14] father's business
[1:12:16] first words that ever recorded
[1:12:19] see he said I came down from heaven not
[1:12:21] to do my own will
[1:12:23] but the will of him that sent me
[1:12:27] see he did not make Adam to be a servant
[1:12:31] Adam was made to be a son
[1:12:35] and Adam could be deceived
[1:12:38] but he made Christ to be a servant an
[1:12:42] obedient servant and being an obedient
[1:12:45] servant he could not be deceived to
[1:12:47] leave the will of God but he stayed in
[1:12:50] the center of the will of God and the
[1:12:52] laws of God
[1:12:54] oh
[1:12:57] if you're a perfect servant
[1:13:01] you will always be dependent on the
[1:13:04] pleasure of you master
[1:13:06] as brother Ram talked about about The
[1:13:09] Pianist or the violence he didn't look
[1:13:11] to the crowd but he looked to the master
[1:13:12] that trained him
[1:13:14] and that is what Christ did
[1:13:19] he did not look for pleasure for himself
[1:13:25] he also the word says made of himself no
[1:13:29] reputation
[1:13:32] say we as humans whatever we do
[1:13:36] I did this yeah I just yeah
[1:13:40] but Christ
[1:13:41] made of himself no reputation
[1:13:45] and that's why I've often wondered why
[1:13:48] when he healed the sick he said don't
[1:13:50] tell nobody
[1:13:52] don't brag about it just keep it for
[1:13:55] yourself because he did not want to
[1:13:58] receive any glory for man
[1:14:02] look at Christ he was not looking for
[1:14:04] Glory for himself he was only looking to
[1:14:07] glorify the father
[1:14:09] because he was a perfect servant that
[1:14:12] God had sent to fulfill the laws of God
[1:14:15] that was written in the law by Moses
[1:14:19] that was his pleasure
[1:14:23] and he gave proof that there could be a
[1:14:25] man
[1:14:27] that could fulfill the law
[1:14:30] we cannot fulfill the law
[1:14:33] but he was one
[1:14:36] that fulfilled the law
[1:14:38] and when he had fast
[1:14:40] 40 days
[1:14:42] Satan came to him
[1:14:45] he knew that he had all authority
[1:14:48] and he said come on use some of your
[1:14:50] Authority
[1:14:52] you could speak to those stones and
[1:14:54] they'd be bred
[1:14:55] you're hungry enough you fasted long
[1:14:57] enough
[1:14:59] but Jesus said man does not live by
[1:15:01] bread alone
[1:15:03] but by every word
[1:15:05] that comes from the mouth of God
[1:15:09] when he was your nurse
[1:15:12] he did the work of a servant
[1:15:15] he said to his disciples
[1:15:18] I have become among you as a servant
[1:15:23] and his serving
[1:15:26] was completely voluntarily
[1:15:29] it was not forced to it
[1:15:32] nobody forced him to do what he did
[1:15:35] but he did it out of love
[1:15:38] he did it for you and me
[1:15:42] now nobody wants to be a servant
[1:15:45] that's against human nature
[1:15:48] right
[1:15:49] that's against human nature
[1:15:54] and Ashley I don't want to be a servant
[1:15:56] but I also don't like being served
[1:16:00] that that's just one thing you know
[1:16:02] sometimes I go someplace especially in
[1:16:04] Africa
[1:16:06] and people kind of want to carry my back
[1:16:09] I don't like that
[1:16:10] I tell them I won't have anyone carry my
[1:16:13] back
[1:16:13] the only persons I admit the honor to
[1:16:16] care of my back is my own Sons
[1:16:18] but I just don't I just don't like it
[1:16:21] and I don't want to be a servant but I
[1:16:23] also don't want to be served
[1:16:25] at least not in the human sense
[1:16:27] but Christ
[1:16:29] by his own will
[1:16:31] he became a servant
[1:16:34] a servant for you and for me
[1:16:38] a servant to help us
[1:16:40] a servant to save us
[1:16:42] and we can see how different that nature
[1:16:45] was from that of Adam
[1:16:47] Adam was a ruler
[1:16:50] God said rule over this Earth
[1:16:54] be the ruler
[1:16:56] but to Christ he said be the servant
[1:16:59] what a difference in nature what a
[1:17:03] difference in office Christ becoming the
[1:17:06] perfect servant
[1:17:12] Adam was lured away from the place of
[1:17:15] obedience
[1:17:17] but Christ never was
[1:17:21] he always stayed in the place of
[1:17:23] obedience
[1:17:26] now it says
[1:17:31] if you buy a Hebrew servant
[1:17:35] he
[1:17:36] Shall Serve for you six years
[1:17:43] now it's six years in here
[1:17:47] is
[1:17:49] the work of man
[1:17:52] God created the Heaven and Earth in six
[1:17:55] days
[1:17:57] and then he rested
[1:18:01] so the work that Christ was to do
[1:18:05] was to serve Humanity
[1:18:08] serve us
[1:18:11] and then
[1:18:13] foreign
[1:18:16] it says
[1:18:18] then you can go free
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:22] see
[1:18:24] the question is what is about us
[1:18:29] whom do we belong to
[1:18:34] the owner of man is God
[1:18:38] a lot of times we don't realize
[1:18:41] we are owned
[1:18:44] we are property
[1:18:47] property of God
[1:18:50] and God has a right to do with us as he
[1:18:54] pleases
[1:18:57] and because we are the property of God
[1:19:02] we owe to God as our creator
[1:19:08] say that about Titus
[1:19:12] when you pay your ties
[1:19:14] you haven't given God anything
[1:19:20] you just paid what was his
[1:19:24] is very simple
[1:19:27] when you live in an apartment
[1:19:30] you pay the rent
[1:19:32] right
[1:19:33] but the rent owns is for the all is the
[1:19:36] person that is the apartments it's not
[1:19:37] that you give them something
[1:19:39] it's not a gift that you do you just pay
[1:19:41] what is his
[1:19:43] now God made this body
[1:19:46] and that body was given strength to work
[1:19:49] so now when we work and God blesses the
[1:19:52] words of our hands and we make money
[1:19:55] then this comes from the body that he
[1:19:57] made so that 10 percent is just his
[1:20:00] because he made you
[1:20:04] you know we don't have to beg for money
[1:20:06] that's not the point but it's just
[1:20:08] realizing ties this
[1:20:10] is God's that's not what you give to God
[1:20:12] it's just his portion if you don't give
[1:20:14] it you rob him offerings is what you
[1:20:16] give to God
[1:20:17] that's different
[1:20:20] but man owes to God
[1:20:23] unqualified surrender
[1:20:26] total submission
[1:20:29] and the unconditional obedience to his
[1:20:32] known will
[1:20:34] we oh God
[1:20:35] to follow every line of scripture that
[1:20:38] we know of
[1:20:41] every commandment
[1:20:43] and the will of God is expressed in the
[1:20:46] book that he gave us
[1:20:48] and we have been called to observe the
[1:20:52] word
[1:20:54] and that's why he said You shall love
[1:20:56] the Lord your God with all your heart
[1:20:57] and your neighbor as yourself
[1:21:01] but none of the descendants of Adam ever
[1:21:04] was able to fulfill it all
[1:21:07] and that's what made the whole world
[1:21:09] guilty
[1:21:10] now when Jesus came he came to the place
[1:21:13] to honor God
[1:21:15] in a place where he was Dishonored
[1:21:17] constantly
[1:21:19] the whole world Dishonored God
[1:21:22] that was believer and non-believer just
[1:21:24] the same
[1:21:26] every time we sin we dishonor God
[1:21:31] and we know no matter the greatest man
[1:21:33] in the Bible
[1:21:35] they dishonor God
[1:21:37] their walk was never perfect
[1:21:39] but now the Lord Jesus came to that
[1:21:42] place of Dishonor to honor God
[1:21:45] to show that there could be someone that
[1:21:48] would honor God in everything that he
[1:21:50] does that there was pleasing of God in
[1:21:53] every action and every move
[1:21:56] he did nothing that ever displeased the
[1:21:59] father
[1:22:00] but he always pleased the father in all
[1:22:03] his actions in all his deeds and all his
[1:22:06] words and all his thoughts in all his
[1:22:08] prayers whatever Christ did he pleased
[1:22:12] father
[1:22:14] he wants that perfect servant
[1:22:19] I want to read here Galatians chapter 4
[1:22:22] and I'll have to read a lot of scripture
[1:22:24] because that I can make the points clear
[1:22:26] better I want to read Galatians chapter
[1:22:28] four
[1:22:32] and it says here in verse 4
[1:22:36] but when the fullness of time was come
[1:22:38] God send forth his son made of a woman
[1:22:42] made under the law which means he was
[1:22:46] put under the law
[1:22:48] that's the interesting thing now the law
[1:22:51] Giver
[1:22:52] he puts himself just under the law that
[1:22:57] he had given himself
[1:23:00] what a difference to the human law
[1:23:02] givers
[1:23:03] we see it in politics they make a law
[1:23:06] they want you to be subject to the law
[1:23:09] but they'll never be subject to that law
[1:23:11] themselves
[1:23:14] right amen that's the truce
[1:23:17] the law givers in our in our economy the
[1:23:21] law Giver is always above the law
[1:23:23] because he made the law so he said if I
[1:23:26] made it I can break it
[1:23:28] but though there's caught the perfect
[1:23:31] law giver and now he comes and subjects
[1:23:35] himself to the law that he himself had
[1:23:37] written
[1:23:39] he applied that law to himself
[1:23:43] what a difference to the man that make
[1:23:46] laws down here
[1:23:49] see and that is what he did he was put
[1:23:53] under the law
[1:23:55] and that's why he said in Matthew 5 17.
[1:23:58] do not think that I've come to abolish
[1:24:01] the law or the prophets
[1:24:03] I am not come to dissolve but I come to
[1:24:08] fulfill the law
[1:24:11] he fulfilled the law to the letter
[1:24:16] and if we could just understand enough
[1:24:18] of the Old Testament we could see how
[1:24:21] the old Old Testament how the law of
[1:24:23] Moses was fulfilled in Jesus Christ
[1:24:29] many times we think yeah we live in the
[1:24:32] Covenant of Christ that is true but yet
[1:24:35] God has a law and the law needs to be
[1:24:38] fulfilled
[1:24:39] the law did not come and sing
[1:24:43] and when we read the passage where he
[1:24:45] says I come not to abolish I come not to
[1:24:47] dissolve I come to fulfill
[1:24:51] that's what he said and that's what he
[1:24:53] did
[1:24:54] now the law of God was in his heart
[1:24:58] he pondered about it day and night
[1:25:01] from beginning to the end in thought in
[1:25:04] word or deed he kept the law
[1:25:07] every demand that God had a man was
[1:25:09] completely fulfilled by the perfect man
[1:25:12] the king
[1:25:13] every claim of God was completely upheld
[1:25:17] Christ was the only man that ever fully
[1:25:20] completed every human responsibility
[1:25:23] that man had to God
[1:25:29] but now the word says
[1:25:32] on the seventh day
[1:25:35] he can go free
[1:25:39] okay
[1:25:42] now Christ
[1:25:44] did not need to go to Calvary
[1:25:49] the law says
[1:25:52] he could have gone free
[1:25:56] he completed the perfect service
[1:26:01] before he went to the cross
[1:26:07] you say brother Bernard
[1:26:09] where did you get this
[1:26:13] I get this from the Mount of
[1:26:14] transfiguration
[1:26:18] because when he stood on the Mount of
[1:26:20] transfiguration
[1:26:22] God bore Witness
[1:26:25] that he was well pleased by the service
[1:26:30] God said this is my beloved Son
[1:26:34] in whom I'm well pleased
[1:26:38] why was God well pleased
[1:26:42] because Christ had fulfilled the law to
[1:26:46] the DOT
[1:26:49] God had no more claim on him
[1:26:53] Christ could have walked out free
[1:26:58] that is why
[1:27:00] they saw the prefiguring of the coming
[1:27:03] of the Lord
[1:27:06] see if we go let's go over to II Peter
[1:27:15] well I want to read these things from
[1:27:17] scripture so that you don't say brother
[1:27:18] Bernard said it
[1:27:21] see second Peter
[1:27:24] chapter one
[1:27:26] verse 16.
[1:27:30] for we have not followed cunningly
[1:27:32] devised Fables
[1:27:34] when we made known unto you the power
[1:27:37] and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:41] but we were eyewitness of his majesty
[1:27:45] for he received from God the Our Father
[1:27:48] honor and Glory when there came such a
[1:27:51] voice from the excellent Glory this is
[1:27:54] my beloved Son in whom I have I am well
[1:27:58] pleased
[1:28:00] on the Mount of transfiguration God
[1:28:02] himself said
[1:28:04] the service
[1:28:06] is completed
[1:28:09] your work as a servant is finished
[1:28:12] because he got from the father honor and
[1:28:16] Glory
[1:28:19] the six days of Labor the six years had
[1:28:23] been over on that day
[1:28:27] but now let us go back to Exodus and see
[1:28:29] what the scriptures is
[1:28:33] I just love because it's such a
[1:28:35] wonderful type of the ministry the work
[1:28:38] of Jesus Christ for his bride
[1:28:42] he said no
[1:28:44] and in the sevens he shall go out free
[1:28:47] for nothing
[1:28:49] if he came in by himself he shall go out
[1:28:52] by himself
[1:28:54] if he were married then with his wife
[1:28:56] hell he shall go out with him
[1:29:00] if his master have given him a wife
[1:29:04] and she have borne his same Sons and
[1:29:07] Daughters his wife and her children
[1:29:08] shall be her Masters
[1:29:11] and he shall go out by himself
[1:29:16] while he was here working
[1:29:19] God gave him a wife and children
[1:29:25] but if he would have gone without going
[1:29:27] to Calvary
[1:29:29] they would have remained the Masters
[1:29:34] see his master not he he did not take
[1:29:37] himself a wife
[1:29:39] he did not come with the wife into this
[1:29:41] world
[1:29:44] but the father had given him
[1:29:48] and that is awesome
[1:29:51] in Scripture
[1:29:53] where it says
[1:29:56] in Hebrews 2 the children that God had
[1:29:59] given me
[1:30:02] see he received a wife and children
[1:30:05] from the master
[1:30:09] but if he would have left
[1:30:12] at the point
[1:30:14] when the service itself was complete he
[1:30:18] would have never been able
[1:30:20] to keep the wife and the children that
[1:30:23] God gave him
[1:30:25] can you see how he how he's walking now
[1:30:28] to fulfill the law
[1:30:30] but then it says
[1:30:33] and and you watch the order
[1:30:35] and if the master shall plainly say
[1:30:38] I love my master
[1:30:42] the love of God was first
[1:30:45] he first loved the father
[1:30:48] but he said and then my wife and my
[1:30:51] children that's the next thing and he
[1:30:55] says I will not go out free
[1:30:58] then his master shall bring him to the
[1:31:01] judges and shall also bring him to the
[1:31:03] door or unto the doorpost and his master
[1:31:05] shall bores Easter with vowel and he
[1:31:09] shall serve him forever
[1:31:13] now this is what he did when he went to
[1:31:15] Gethsemane
[1:31:18] he he knew
[1:31:20] he didn't have to do it he said father
[1:31:25] if this cop could pass
[1:31:28] but not my will but thy will shall be
[1:31:30] done
[1:31:31] that's when his ear was pierced that he
[1:31:35] absolutely subjected to the father even
[1:31:38] unto this
[1:31:40] now here's a difference as a servant you
[1:31:43] can subject to service you give your
[1:31:45] labor to the master the master gets your
[1:31:48] strengths but the master does not get
[1:31:50] your life
[1:31:51] but here the perfect servant he came and
[1:31:55] he he not only gave the service to the
[1:31:57] master but he gave his life to the
[1:32:00] master he gave his life for you and me
[1:32:03] to get to Ransom us because God had
[1:32:06] given him a wife and children and that's
[1:32:09] why he said I love my master I love my
[1:32:12] wife I love my children I'm going to be
[1:32:16] a servant forever
[1:32:19] kind of walk away I fulfill the law to
[1:32:22] the dot I go to the end
[1:32:27] now if his servant
[1:32:31] remains in the house of the master
[1:32:35] finally I'm talking I'm talking
[1:32:38] naturally now
[1:32:42] finally he gonna be the heir of all
[1:32:44] things
[1:32:46] never realized in the natural
[1:32:50] so he doesn't say that the master had a
[1:32:52] son he had his servants
[1:32:54] but in the natural
[1:32:57] if the servant decides
[1:33:01] to remain in the house of the master
[1:33:03] forever
[1:33:05] he become the heir of all things
[1:33:10] but see
[1:33:11] he first had
[1:33:14] to die
[1:33:16] the corn of wheat
[1:33:20] must first fall into the ground
[1:33:23] round
[1:33:25] because if it does not fall into the
[1:33:28] ground
[1:33:30] and die
[1:33:31] it will abide by itself
[1:33:35] see Jesus was speaking of himself
[1:33:39] he knew that he first had to die
[1:33:43] if he would have not died
[1:33:46] he would have remained alone
[1:33:51] but he died
[1:33:53] so that he could
[1:33:54] Ransom
[1:33:56] those which were predestinated by the
[1:34:00] grace of God
[1:34:14] see the perfection
[1:34:16] of the servant of God
[1:34:19] was there to show the difference between
[1:34:24] Christ and the sinful man
[1:34:27] just to show it even clearer
[1:34:32] and
[1:34:33] when he said I love my Lord my wife and
[1:34:37] my children
[1:34:39] I will not go free
[1:34:41] where did he bring him
[1:34:43] he brought him to the doorpost
[1:34:47] when he pierced the ear
[1:34:50] the blood started flowing
[1:34:53] look back to Moses
[1:34:56] put the blood on the doorpost
[1:35:00] I just love these Connections in
[1:35:02] Scripture
[1:35:03] God always using the same type
[1:35:09] he renounced his Liberty
[1:35:12] he was fully entitled to it
[1:35:16] but he
[1:35:19] showed the love of God
[1:35:22] that's what it was
[1:35:24] he loved the master his master
[1:35:26] he loved his wife
[1:35:29] and he loved his children
[1:35:32] and let me go back to what I just said
[1:35:35] where he says in Matthew
[1:35:38] to all John 12 message 17 he said the
[1:35:41] hour has come for the son of man to be
[1:35:43] glorified
[1:35:45] verily verily I say unto you unless the
[1:35:47] grain of wheat falls in the ground it
[1:35:49] dies it remains alone
[1:35:51] and then he adds but if it dies it Bears
[1:35:54] much fruit
[1:35:55] but notice what follows
[1:35:59] he said now my soul is troubled what
[1:36:02] shall I say
[1:36:04] it's the moment of decision
[1:36:07] see that servant had to made a decision
[1:36:10] the time came he could be free but now
[1:36:13] he had to make a decision
[1:36:16] and I believe that when you're taking
[1:36:18] the natural any man that is a servant
[1:36:21] for six years
[1:36:22] the decision to stay or to go is not
[1:36:25] made likely
[1:36:26] he's going to ponder about it he's going
[1:36:29] to think about it he's going to reflect
[1:36:31] on what the consequences are
[1:36:34] and that's why he says now my soul is
[1:36:37] troubled
[1:36:39] how shall I decide
[1:36:44] and he says
[1:36:46] what shall I say
[1:36:48] shall I say father save me from this
[1:36:51] hour
[1:36:53] and then he answered his own question
[1:36:56] he said but for this cause I have come
[1:36:59] to this hour
[1:37:01] father glorify thy name
[1:37:06] why did he say that
[1:37:08] love Beyond understanding
[1:37:13] All Is Love
[1:37:15] he put entirely
[1:37:17] at the service of his beloved
[1:37:22] no matter what the terrible hour
[1:37:24] contained
[1:37:26] he knew it all
[1:37:29] he knew what was going to happen
[1:37:34] so that love
[1:37:35] it caused him to do a service
[1:37:39] that the law had not imposed on him
[1:37:45] see the first six years
[1:37:48] that was keeping the law
[1:37:52] but when he went to Calvary
[1:37:55] that was not what the law had required
[1:38:00] that he did by his free will
[1:38:05] serving
[1:38:06] walking the ministry eating the sick
[1:38:11] I'm raising the dead casting out demons
[1:38:14] spreading the love of God that boss of
[1:38:17] the law had required
[1:38:19] but the claw never required him to go to
[1:38:22] Calvary he did that by his own free will
[1:38:25] there was nothing that forced him God
[1:38:28] himself by his old juicing choose to die
[1:38:31] for you and for me
[1:38:33] hallelujah what can we say more what a
[1:38:36] great God do we serve
[1:38:39] [Applause]
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:48] that's what we have to see
[1:38:54] God looked for someone more righteous
[1:38:56] than the children of man
[1:38:59] and he sure was
[1:39:01] and his motivation was always to be
[1:39:05] that perfect servant
[1:39:10] even when Lazarus was on the brink of
[1:39:13] dying when he got sick
[1:39:16] now in the natural
[1:39:19] if a friend of ours gets sick
[1:39:23] we're not going to wait two or three
[1:39:25] days
[1:39:28] we're going to try to get to him as fast
[1:39:30] as we can
[1:39:33] amen that's the truth
[1:39:37] you know we some of our friends is
[1:39:39] really in need
[1:39:41] we're not going to wait
[1:39:44] and Jesus if he would have done his own
[1:39:46] will
[1:39:47] he would have went when they called him
[1:39:50] but he realized that the master the
[1:39:53] father had another plan
[1:39:56] he didn't want to be glorified just by
[1:39:58] healing
[1:39:59] he wanted to be glorified by
[1:40:01] Resurrection
[1:40:03] that's how he subjected himself that's
[1:40:06] why he stayed two or three more days
[1:40:12] now what about us
[1:40:17] we all also service to our maker
[1:40:22] or not of Our Own
[1:40:25] we're also Servants of the master
[1:40:29] because in Philippians
[1:40:32] in verse in chapter 2 verse 5 it says
[1:40:36] let the mind be in you
[1:40:39] which was also in Christ
[1:40:42] see and then he goes on to say
[1:40:45] that he became obedient and was made a
[1:40:48] servant
[1:40:50] now if Christ was made a servant for us
[1:40:55] we are to be servants for Christ and for
[1:40:58] one another
[1:41:00] a lot of times
[1:41:01] we forget that
[1:41:05] but God had given him a bride
[1:41:09] God had given him children
[1:41:12] he did not want to lose those
[1:41:15] he wanted to keep those
[1:41:18] and
[1:41:20] it's quite interesting
[1:41:23] that Jesus
[1:41:24] addressed his disciples always as his
[1:41:27] disciples
[1:41:30] but after he rose
[1:41:32] from the grave
[1:41:35] he did not call them disciples anymore
[1:41:39] he said to Mary go tell my brethren
[1:41:44] see now
[1:41:46] they were part of the family
[1:41:49] now they became his brethren because now
[1:41:52] he had paid the full price
[1:41:55] now he would stay in the house forever
[1:41:58] he would never walk away
[1:42:02] and he has delivered us
[1:42:06] and that's what he's done on Calvary
[1:42:09] that's why he had his ears pierced
[1:42:13] that's why he became the Lamb of God
[1:42:17] to be sprinkled on the doorpost
[1:42:21] and whenever the blood was sprinkled it
[1:42:24] kept the hand of God away
[1:42:26] no more judgment
[1:42:28] and we know that the love of Christ it
[1:42:31] was not limited
[1:42:33] just to a bride just to people from
[1:42:35] Nations but he also had
[1:42:38] Israel in his mind
[1:42:41] everyone
[1:42:43] that was predestinated he had them
[1:42:46] you see it said
[1:42:49] he will become
[1:42:51] a servant forever
[1:42:55] not thinking about that
[1:42:58] God
[1:42:59] our God
[1:43:02] becoming a servant
[1:43:04] to us forever
[1:43:07] yes
[1:43:09] that's what he said
[1:43:12] now after he was risen from the dead
[1:43:16] Thomas said I will not believe
[1:43:19] unless I can see the marks
[1:43:22] and what did Jesus say
[1:43:25] he said come fill my hand
[1:43:29] and the Marx was still there
[1:43:32] come feel my side
[1:43:35] and the Mark was still there
[1:43:39] he kept bearing the mark
[1:43:42] of being a servant even after the
[1:43:45] resurrection
[1:43:47] and today
[1:43:49] He's Still the Lamb of God
[1:43:52] because John turned and he saw a lamb
[1:43:56] as it was written or slain before the
[1:43:59] foundation of the world
[1:44:02] thinking that our God remains that
[1:44:06] servant
[1:44:08] and he's speaking about the kingdom
[1:44:14] and he said
[1:44:20] blessed are those servants whom the Lord
[1:44:22] when he comes
[1:44:24] will find watching
[1:44:27] truly I say unto you
[1:44:30] he will geared himself
[1:44:33] and set them at the table
[1:44:37] and will come out and serve them
[1:44:44] fulfilling the law of God
[1:44:48] in eternity that is to come
[1:44:52] a law that never changed
[1:44:55] and that would have said this morning
[1:44:57] may have been new to you
[1:45:00] you might have never seen that scripture
[1:45:02] in that way
[1:45:04] but I can say by scripture
[1:45:06] that Christ fulfilled it all
[1:45:10] he fulfilled that Hebrew servant's life
[1:45:14] he fulfilled the law for you and for me
[1:45:18] and all that we can do today is rejoice
[1:45:21] and be glad because he came to save us
[1:45:27] he fulfilled the law
[1:45:29] that we could never fulfill
[1:45:32] and he pleased the father
[1:45:35] on our behalf
[1:45:37] and the father gave him the wife and
[1:45:40] children which we are today
[1:45:42] all the Blessed people
[1:45:45] I trust that I was able
[1:45:49] to paint the picture of Christ this
[1:45:51] morning before your eyes
[1:45:53] that you would Rejoice more
[1:45:56] in what he has done for you
[1:45:58] that you would love him more for what
[1:46:00] he's done
[1:46:02] that you could see more of his grace
[1:46:04] and that is why I love to preach on
[1:46:07] Christ
[1:46:09] because he is the center of our
[1:46:11] attraction
[1:46:12] he's the center of our face
[1:46:14] he's the center of our life
[1:46:16] he's the center of our church service
[1:46:18] that's what we are we are a
[1:46:21] christ-centered church
[1:46:23] he is in the middle of our congregation
[1:46:26] he's here to save us
[1:46:28] he's here to heal us he's here to
[1:46:31] deliver us because he still serves us
[1:46:34] with the gifts that was given to him
[1:46:37] praise the name of the Lord let us stand
[1:46:43] only father Lord Jesus
[1:46:45] larvae thank you for your word this
[1:46:48] morning that we can see fulfilled in
[1:46:50] Christ

[1:46:55] vain
[1:46:56] it was not given just for people back in
[1:46:59] the wilderness Lord God
[1:47:01] and it was given to us to see how it was
[1:47:04] fulfilled in Christ

[1:55:22] Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing
