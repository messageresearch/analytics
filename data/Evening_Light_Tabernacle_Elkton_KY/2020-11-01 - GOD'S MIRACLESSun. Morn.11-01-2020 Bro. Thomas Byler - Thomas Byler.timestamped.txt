[37:34] we love you lord jesus and ask god that
[37:36] you're blessed to reading the word the
[37:37] meditation of our heart now
[37:39] in jesus christ's name amen and amen
[37:42] praise the lord
[37:44] we will be having a couple of visiting
[37:46] ministers this month i know brother ted
[37:47] vanessa and he's going to speak for us
[37:49] on a wednesday night and then a brother
[37:51] heart from
[37:52] indiana the following sunday brother ted
[37:55] will be speaking us to us on a wednesday
[37:57] night
[37:57] i think it's the 18th amen and brother
[38:00] hart from indiana will be speaking on
[38:02] the sunday after that amen
[38:04] so we do look forward to hear and amen
[38:08] other of god's ministers speak to us if
[38:10] you will turn your bibles this morning
[38:12] let's go to the book of genesis and also
[38:14] the hebrews i just have about
[38:16] four or five scriptures this morning but
[38:18] we'll just read
[38:20] two of them to start with as we begin to
[38:22] speak about god's miracles
[38:24] god's miracles
[38:30] you know we realize that this is a time
[38:32] when
[38:33] everybody is thinking about election and
[38:36] all those
[38:36] politics and so forth but i ran across
[38:39] the place and i tried to find it again
[38:40] but i couldn't but i ran across the
[38:42] place where brother
[38:42] branham he says you know god don't care
[38:44] about who's president next
[38:47] you know he don't care about all this
[38:48] politics and all of that stuff you know
[38:49] we know
[38:50] we know he's in control of it all anyway
[38:52] but that's not what god's focused on
[38:55] that's not what god thinks about we're
[38:57] thinking about so much greater than
[38:59] who's going to be the next prize
[39:00] president amen amen because
[39:02] if it was up to me and you we wouldn't
[39:04] even endorse this president
[39:06] because he endorses homosexuality in
[39:09] that right
[39:10] and so but you know but we all have a
[39:12] right to vote and i don't want to
[39:13] discourage all of that and that's not
[39:14] not for me to say here but i'm just
[39:16] saying that when god looks
[39:18] he looks at a much bigger picture amen
[39:20] than the elections and so forth and
[39:22] amen i just want to say let's get our
[39:23] mind off of that and get it on god
[39:26] amen and i don't know about you but i've
[39:27] got my focus and my desire
[39:29] is to have a body change amen we're
[39:32] looking not for another president we're
[39:34] looking for
[39:34] amen our lord and our king our savior in
[39:37] disguise
[39:39] amen we're here listening for a sound to
[39:41] come up higher amen
[39:43] amen so god bless you this morning if
[39:45] you will we'll just turn to genesis the
[39:47] first chapter the first verse
[39:54] we'll read the first three verses
[39:59] in the beginning god created the heavens
[40:03] and the earth and the earth was without
[40:06] form and void and darkness was upon the
[40:10] face of the deep
[40:11] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[40:12] face of the waters and god said
[40:15] let there be light and there was
[40:18] light and of course we all know that he
[40:21] spoke many many more things and
[40:23] created everything that is right the
[40:25] grass the fruit tree
[40:26] and all of these other things you
[40:27] created now turn with me if you will but
[40:30] go to hebrews 11. it's another
[40:32] another description of the creation amen
[40:50] amen
[40:55] hebrews 11 verse 1 through
[40:59] 3. now faith is the substance of things
[41:03] hoped for the evidence
[41:05] of things not seen for by it the elders
[41:08] obtained
[41:08] a good good report through faith we
[41:12] understand that the worlds were framed
[41:14] by the word of god so that things which
[41:17] are seen
[41:18] were made of things which do not appear
[41:21] may god add his blessings to the reading
[41:23] of the word you can be seated
[41:26] you know as i begin to think about god's
[41:28] miracles
[41:29] god's miracles
[41:32] amen i thought about god's miracles
[41:35] in in several different aspects amen
[41:38] one of them is in god's providence and
[41:42] the providence of god and the miracle
[41:45] that is in just
[41:46] in god's providence the other one is in
[41:48] his creation
[41:50] amen we know that uh
[41:53] so many times we think of god miracles
[41:55] we think of it
[41:57] as something that's perhaps
[41:58] supernaturally happens
[42:00] to automatically change something but i
[42:03] believe there's many miracles that god
[42:05] does that
[42:06] if we aren't careful we don't even
[42:08] recognize them we don't even see them
[42:10] in that right amen and so
[42:14] i don't know which i really want to take
[42:15] first but
[42:17] amen i know that how many knows that god
[42:19] is in nature
[42:21] amen god is in nature amen he's in
[42:24] creation
[42:25] and so we read the first verse of
[42:28] genesis we realize that that in itself
[42:31] and also in hebrews 11
[42:33] that in itself was a complete miracle
[42:37] because uh let me just let me just
[42:40] read you a quote i'm going to try to lay
[42:42] this out if i can
[42:45] right here let's talk about take the
[42:47] creation first
[42:49] and talk about creation brother branham
[42:52] began to explain
[42:53] you know creation because we know
[42:54] science
[42:56] they've been trying to figure out where
[42:58] things come from is that right
[43:00] how things are made and i'm just gonna
[43:03] read this to you because
[43:05] um uh it's it's the way that the prophet
[43:09] of god explained it he says now let's
[43:12] take a simple
[43:14] drop of ink but abandoning god in
[43:16] simplicity he says everything is for
[43:19] a purpose another man says you've
[43:21] gathered here this morning
[43:23] for a purpose amen
[43:27] now how many knows the world the world
[43:29] doesn't really understand that
[43:31] everything that was made and that just
[43:34] comes to mind now
[43:35] that over in ephesians and galatians how
[43:37] that paul talked about that
[43:39] he created all things for
[43:43] his purpose isn't that right and so i
[43:46] didn't think about that till now but
[43:48] but how did everything that was made it
[43:50] was made for the purpose of god so
[43:53] people that don't have a purpose it's a
[43:56] terrible life to have
[43:58] a life without purpose is a meaningless
[44:01] life
[44:02] how do you believe you've got to have a
[44:03] purpose in life and i think that's one
[44:06] thing that referendum god picks up here
[44:08] when he even begins to talk about this
[44:09] drop of ink and how that
[44:11] god begin to create he was he was
[44:13] beginning to explain
[44:15] how that uh how that uh
[44:18] you know how that i guess our moms and
[44:20] our dads and where we come from
[44:22] and and whenever we would get perhaps a
[44:24] splotch of
[44:25] ink on us or on our clothes how did we
[44:27] take maybe
[44:28] coal oil or gas or something right
[44:31] and they said they would rub that around
[44:33] and try to scrub it out
[44:35] and he talked about how that you know
[44:37] the only thing it really did was make it
[44:39] bigger
[44:40] it never really took care of the problem
[44:43] it made it worse
[44:45] and he said it's kind of like in the old
[44:46] testament people would try to
[44:48] get rid of their sustain of their sin
[44:51] and so forth and you know they
[44:52] never could really get rid of it isn't
[44:56] that right
[44:57] and so they could never really get rid
[44:59] of it but he was talking about that god
[45:01] had done the same thing that science has
[45:03] done and that is that they created what
[45:05] he called a bleach
[45:07] amen a bleach and that's right so first
[45:10] of all he says you know we're gathered
[45:11] here for
[45:12] a purpose amen now notice
[45:16] this church is erected for a purpose
[45:19] there's nothing without a purpose
[45:22] and a cause
[45:27] now bubba says part of the bleach water
[45:30] which is h2o which
[45:32] is uh which is hydrogen
[45:35] and oxygen i don't i don't have a great
[45:38] education but i think we all know that
[45:40] it's
[45:41] one part hydrogen and two parts oxygen
[45:44] right
[45:46] now what is that h2 oh that's not
[45:49] correct brother man
[45:50] h2o one part hydrogen just two parts
[45:53] oxygen i don't know all right well
[45:54] if you all don't know i sure don't know
[45:55] either so we'll leave that one
[45:57] hello but anyway h2o
[46:01] which is hydrogen and oxygen and both
[46:03] hydrogen and oxygen both are dangerous
[46:06] explosives now
[46:10] if water is made out of dangerous
[46:13] explosive
[46:15] aminos the prophet of god said that even
[46:17] the waters would explode
[46:21] so can you imagine the explosion if
[46:24] two-thirds of the world is water
[46:27] and if the water is going to explode
[46:30] what kind of an explosion it's going to
[46:32] be
[46:33] it's going to be quite an explosion
[46:36] because how many knows that there was no
[46:37] more sea on the other land
[46:39] over there there's no more amen
[46:43] you know i'm sure we've all wondered but
[46:45] we've all wondered how god is going to
[46:46] clean this off
[46:47] because we've made a real good mess out
[46:49] of it how's he going to clean this off
[46:52] and make it a fit millennium for us to
[46:54] live in
[46:56] but we also understand but obama brother
[46:59] brown talked about how that
[47:00] the volcanics will come forth from the
[47:02] center of the earth
[47:03] you know maybe bury it all burn it all
[47:05] bury it all
[47:06] but we know that when we come in the
[47:08] millennium it'll be a whole
[47:10] new paradise of god
[47:14] amen so look at that the hydrogen and
[47:17] oxygen both dangerous now notice he says
[47:21] and then hydrogen and oxygen are
[47:24] actually ashes
[47:26] ashes that's what it is a chemical
[47:30] ashes just chemical ashes now
[47:34] put it together and you got water break
[47:36] it up you got hydrogen and
[47:38] oxygen but just keep on going back
[47:42] just keep going back he was talking
[47:43] about creation
[47:45] and how they want to go all the way down
[47:47] and break things down
[47:48] down and i was thinking you know and i
[47:51] just go with what the probably god said
[47:53] and a lot of a lot of
[47:54] people here probably have went to uh
[47:56] perhaps be an assistant or
[47:58] medic medicine and so forth so you'll
[48:00] know a whole lot more about it
[48:01] but you know it goes down into the
[48:03] chemistry of the body and everything he
[48:05] begins to explain
[48:06] now getting into this he says listen
[48:09] there might become a sitting here i want
[48:11] to say because there would be
[48:13] chemists listening at it i don't know
[48:14] the formula but i just want to explain
[48:16] it to my own humble way
[48:18] trusting god will help me look if i drop
[48:21] that ink into a bleach what happens
[48:23] immediately the black stain is gone
[48:28] amen so through science they figured out
[48:31] how to make a bleach
[48:33] and something that if you put ink ink
[48:35] itself in it it completely eradicates
[48:37] completely gets it going
[48:39] it's completely gone amen
[48:44] no more smearing around and he was
[48:46] talking about the blood of jesus christ
[48:48] how did
[48:48] god had come up with the formula
[48:53] also amen by the blood of jesus christ
[48:56] by the blood of god that when your sins
[48:58] get dropped in that bleach
[49:00] they become completely gone
[49:06] i don't know about you but that makes me
[49:07] happy aren't you glad
[49:10] amen you asked me why i'm happy i'll
[49:13] just tell you why because
[49:16] my sins are gone let me tell you you
[49:18] can't have your sins gone
[49:20] and not be happy it makes you happy
[49:24] [Music]
[49:26] the whole world lacks happy people
[49:30] why because everybody's polluted there's
[49:32] no innocence there's not people that
[49:34] have been in dropped in that blood
[49:36] that god has created i mean not the very
[49:40] the the the um
[49:43] jesus christ himself in the womb of
[49:47] mary was a spoken word
[49:50] that which is conceived of her is of the
[49:53] holy ghost
[49:54] let me tell you it was not mary's egg
[49:57] hello
[49:58] amen it was not not god having a sex act
[50:01] with mary no it wasn't there was no
[50:04] sensation he was absolutely spoken
[50:07] word pure unadulterated god himself
[50:11] amen both parts both the egg amen and
[50:14] this
[50:15] germ it was god himself it was spoken
[50:18] word and that folks i want you to know
[50:19] it was god's
[50:20] own blood that we're washed by
[50:24] praise be to god this morning amen god
[50:28] amen creating a blood cell
[50:31] amen that you and i could be washed by
[50:33] the blood of jesus christ
[50:35] amen praise the lord
[50:38] so now notice he said that's what
[50:40] happens the black state is gone you
[50:42] can't find it again
[50:43] if you had to you can remember your past
[50:47] but god
[50:48] no if it's washed in the blood it's gone
[50:54] see it no more you won't have to come up
[50:58] with the white throne judgment and give
[50:59] an answer for all your things
[51:01] why because it's already gone it's in
[51:04] the sea of god's forgetfulness only
[51:07] those who have not
[51:08] sent their sins up beforehand have to
[51:10] give an answer for their sin
[51:12] praise the lord what happened you don't
[51:14] see nothing come up from that
[51:16] no because it's broke up now science
[51:19] would say that it turned
[51:21] back to its original acids
[51:25] amen back to its original assets back it
[51:28] broke it up
[51:28] whatever that ink was made out of it
[51:30] went all right back to its original
[51:32] assets
[51:33] and brother bam talk about creation and
[51:35] how that when we die
[51:37] amen in our skin goes and our body goes
[51:39] everything equals back to gases it
[51:41] actually goes back to chemicals
[51:44] and that right and chemicals that you
[51:47] couldn't see with your natural eye
[51:49] somebody noticed the creation was made
[51:51] of things that are not seen you can't
[51:53] see chemicals
[51:56] you might smell them you might feel the
[51:58] effects of them
[51:59] but it's in another it just you can't
[52:01] see it amen
[52:04] so we're getting into the creation and
[52:06] how god made
[52:07] things by faith we understand that the
[52:11] worlds were framed
[52:13] from things which are not seen
[52:16] comes from the invisible and it's a
[52:19] place
[52:20] where science can go so far they can
[52:23] find
[52:23] atoms and they can find molecules and so
[52:26] forth
[52:27] let me just read this now where now
[52:29] notice
[52:30] it went back to acids and then brother
[52:32] bam says now where
[52:33] what did acids come from
[52:37] where did those asses come from see
[52:42] it has to be from a certain thing
[52:45] let's say for instance like fumes
[52:48] made acids fumes made acids
[52:53] where did the fumes come from we'll say
[52:56] fumes was made by molecules where
[52:59] molecules come from
[53:01] from atoms where atoms come from
[53:04] from electrons where did that come from
[53:08] cosmic light amen hallelujah
[53:12] because of cosmic like see you're
[53:14] plumbed back of finding
[53:16] what the pres the chemists can't find
[53:21] praise the lord now i mean i'm talking
[53:24] about those
[53:25] martyrs those christians that were fed
[53:27] to lions that were burned at the stake
[53:29] until their bodies and everything is
[53:31] completely annihilated
[53:33] he says you know those even your body
[53:35] that god has created goes back
[53:37] to the gases perhaps that he come from
[53:40] amen but he says one day when god comes
[53:43] he will
[53:43] call every bit of that back
[53:47] he knows where your fumes he knows where
[53:50] your asses he knows where your
[53:52] chemist your everything he knows where
[53:54] it all this when he speaks
[53:56] it'll all come back together you know
[53:59] kind of like some people are
[54:01] people that like to be buried personally
[54:03] if i die go ahead and bury me
[54:05] i don't want to be burnt to a little
[54:07] crisp but others prefer cremation
[54:14] and that right to be cremated to where
[54:15] there's just a few ashes left
[54:18] you might you know you know i want my
[54:20] boys and my wife to be able to come
[54:22] you know and visit say hey my dad's body
[54:25] is down there
[54:26] amen but otherwise you do what they go
[54:28] back to the gases fire will put that
[54:30] body
[54:31] and it'll put it back into gases back
[54:33] where back where it was before he was
[54:35] made how many knows that god
[54:37] spoke he took the dirt the ashes or the
[54:39] dirt from the earth
[54:40] and he spoke adam and eve into existence
[54:42] he created the body out of the dust of
[54:44] the earth
[54:45] that's why we go back to the dust that
[54:47] we come from
[54:48] where did the dirt come from so much
[54:50] petroleum so much um
[54:52] different 17 elements of the earth
[54:54] better set that their bodies made from
[54:56] and then we go back to those elements
[54:57] that god created us by
[54:59] but god is able doesn't matter how far
[55:02] they are
[55:04] oh my i think that's why the prophet
[55:06] that's why i would consider it an
[55:08] honor to be a martyr for god you
[55:11] wouldn't mind
[55:11] giving your life for almighty god he's
[55:14] worth dying for
[55:16] he's worth living for although 68
[55:18] million they gladly gave their life and
[55:20] guess what god will call one day
[55:23] and it doesn't matter how far they're
[55:24] going how much he'll
[55:26] call everybody's molecules everybody's
[55:28] atoms everybody's chemistry back to our
[55:30] life
[55:32] and he'll take him into glory they will
[55:34] live forever
[55:35] god is able to do it he created it once
[55:37] he can call it back
[55:39] that's the god of creation
[55:42] hallelujah how many knows it's an
[55:44] absolute miracle
[55:45] amen if you can't figure it out we can
[55:47] go back and know it comes from
[55:48] atoms it comes and balaam says even the
[55:50] molecules have so many or the atoms have
[55:53] so many molecules in them
[55:54] and you can go back so far but then
[55:56] that's about where they leave off
[55:57] because when it goes back to light you
[56:00] go back god speaking the word and it was
[56:07] amen just how god does it i don't know
[56:09] but he does it
[56:10] and it's a miracle it's a miracle
[56:15] one of the greatest miracles amen
[56:19] praise the lord the miracle
[56:23] of creation the miracle of nature
[56:27] amen just the miracle
[56:30] of nature now
[56:42] so he says now it shows that there was
[56:45] something
[56:45] back younger to begin with that's only
[56:48] common sense it's a creation
[56:50] it has to have a creator
[56:53] and it went out from the creator and it
[56:56] was determined
[56:58] and put into these different now he says
[57:00] now
[57:01] science cannot take and adam b 16 times
[57:04] 12
[57:05] times 14 times whatever and make that
[57:08] but god is the one that has to do that
[57:10] then it's brought down to a place to
[57:12] where it's got down to the atoms and
[57:14] then on down
[57:15] science can't even begin to touch it
[57:18] amen
[57:20] all right now notice he says and then it
[57:23] comes out into molecules and then they
[57:25] could begin to see it a little better
[57:27] then it comes down into something else
[57:29] and then the first thing it comes into
[57:30] chemicals and then
[57:31] they blend all of these things together
[57:33] now brother brown did say
[57:35] he talked about how that uh how did uh
[57:38] scientists and so forth have actually
[57:40] discovered that adam
[57:42] and he says you know they know that
[57:44] everything is held together
[57:46] by adams i mean knows that listen maybe
[57:49] just read this
[57:50] he says like here some time ago they
[57:52] found an atom
[57:54] and they know that there was atoms he
[57:56] says and then the atoms form molecules
[57:58] and so forth and they got the search and
[58:00] someone believed that if the atom held
[58:02] everything together
[58:04] if that atom could be turned around that
[58:06] it would be
[58:07] what's holding it and breaking it apart
[58:09] because everything is helped by an adam
[58:11] we know that
[58:12] this post is held by adams you're held
[58:14] together with atoms the grass the tree
[58:17] everything is held together by atoms
[58:21] well if the atom turning all one way if
[58:24] it can be broken and turned back
[58:26] it would destroy amen
[58:29] now the scientists believed that they
[58:31] could be done and they worked and it
[58:32] worked
[58:33] they said hour after hour week after
[58:35] week year after year until they
[58:38] finally conquered it how many had ever
[58:40] seen the documentary of america and how
[58:42] we had a secret city and when we went to
[58:44] looking for
[58:45] and trying to create the atom bomb it
[58:47] was a complete secret
[58:49] and they worked hard for months and
[58:51] months and months
[58:52] to create that atom bomb and it's
[58:54] actually the bomb that
[58:55] actually won world war ii
[58:59] it defeated the chaps isn't that right
[59:01] because we dropped it on them
[59:02] amen and it was actually the power amen
[59:04] of the adam and now we realize that that
[59:07] atom and my my my
[59:08] what they won't do with that atom bomb
[59:11] called the animal
[59:13] amen but they turned around and realized
[59:16] that it'll destroy
[59:17] everything amen but listen everything is
[59:20] held together comes down to molecules
[59:22] and so forth
[59:23] held together by that amen scientists i
[59:26] mean that they could touch that but they
[59:27] can't touch the other
[59:29] so how many is glad this morning to know
[59:31] that it was absolute miracle
[59:33] by faith we understand that the worlds
[59:36] were
[59:36] framed together by
[59:40] god said let there be and there was
[59:44] now i want you to know something my
[59:45] friend that if you're a christian
[59:47] you live by the same faith that god had
[59:50] when he said let there be and where
[59:53] there was nothing before
[59:55] now there is something and you and i
[59:58] when we get into such
[1:00:00] situations and places god said
[1:00:02] whatsoever you shall ask
[1:00:04] in my name i will do it we live in the
[1:00:07] world folks where the world may be
[1:00:09] limited the
[1:00:09] natural world would be limited but you
[1:00:12] and i are not limited this morning
[1:00:14] we are unlimited this morning because
[1:00:16] with god all things are possible
[1:00:21] praise be to god we know that abel
[1:00:24] offered by faith a more excellent
[1:00:26] sacrifice than that of cain
[1:00:29] why because he had a revelation of what
[1:00:31] god wanted
[1:00:33] like i said one said wednesday listen
[1:00:35] when we come to church
[1:00:36] amen god either accepts our praise and
[1:00:39] our worship where he rejects our praise
[1:00:41] and our worship
[1:00:43] god help us at each one of us that god
[1:00:45] would accept our worship because that's
[1:00:47] what we come for
[1:00:48] we come to worship god in spirit and in
[1:00:51] truth
[1:00:51] we come to glorify god that's what i
[1:00:54] like to think about
[1:00:56] not some election and politics but get
[1:00:58] my mind on god
[1:00:59] amen it'll make your whole world
[1:01:01] completely different
[1:01:02] if you get your mind on politics in the
[1:01:04] world it'll be depressing
[1:01:07] but you get it on god and it's untold
[1:01:10] what you can do
[1:01:11] the blessings that come with it how many
[1:01:15] believes that
[1:01:17] amen god is good i love to have my mind
[1:01:21] on god just to think about it
[1:01:25] why is it just to think about god and
[1:01:27] his thoughts amen today just
[1:01:29] the miracles of god people don't believe
[1:01:32] in miracles
[1:01:33] they don't realize they're walking on a
[1:01:35] miracle
[1:01:37] they're living in a miracle just this

[1:01:41] just you being alive is a miracle
[1:01:45] you being here this morning it's a
[1:01:46] miracle brother man said the natural

[1:01:55] you become born again it changes your
[1:01:57] nature it's a miracle

[1:02:02] a million other people that god could
[1:02:03] have picked
[1:02:05] that could have been here but he chose
[1:02:07] you whether it was black
[1:02:09] whether it was redheaded whatever color
[1:02:11] you are be thankful for your color
[1:02:13] because god made you that way

[1:02:42] like brother troy
[1:02:46] huh we wouldn't know who's who

[1:06:17] brother bam even talks about this i'm
[1:06:19] not sure maybe even the quote here but
[1:06:21] he talks about how that
[1:06:22] you know here the world has been here
[1:06:23] for six thousand years and it never
[1:06:26] never misses a beat how many knows the
[1:06:29] sun don't miss me
[1:06:31] it's shining just like you did when adam
[1:06:33] was here when eve was here
[1:06:34] when all of those same patriarchs it's
[1:06:36] just still the same cycle
[1:06:39] praise be to god it's a miracle
[1:06:44] amen talk about god in nature
[1:06:47] doing miracles
[1:06:51] everybody see all them leaves fall this
[1:06:53] morning
[1:06:55] you know you're seeing a miracle
[1:06:58] you know why you know why you're seeing
[1:06:59] a miracle
[1:07:01] because you have are experiencing
[1:07:05] watching
[1:07:06] god telling those trees in that life
[1:07:09] go down quickly because ain't got their
[1:07:13] own prophet's head
[1:07:14] huh remember how that atheist up in the
[1:07:17] hills
[1:07:18] said that oh that's just nature
[1:07:21] brother man was witnessing to a to a man
[1:07:25] brother banks woods i think it was him
[1:07:28] and brother banks woods squirrel hunting
[1:07:29] they went up to this atheist but the
[1:07:32] banks went out there and began to talk
[1:07:33] to him and
[1:07:34] telling him you know they didn't want
[1:07:35] the squirrel hunt y'all know this story
[1:07:37] well
[1:07:39] and he says well that's wonderful thank
[1:07:42] you for giving me permission i also got
[1:07:44] my preacher with me do you mind if he
[1:07:46] hunts
[1:07:46] he said brother banks you don't mean to
[1:07:48] tell me you got so low down until you
[1:07:50] got to carry a preacher everywhere you
[1:07:51] go
[1:07:55] huh and when brother brandon finally
[1:07:56] come up there and talk to him he says
[1:07:58] well i better get out and go out there
[1:07:59] and talk he began to
[1:08:00] talk to him he says i ain't got nothing
[1:08:02] against you preachers i just think
[1:08:03] you're barking up the wrong tree
[1:08:06] in other words a lying dog
[1:08:10] huh he tells a bunch of lion dogs in a
[1:08:13] nice way
[1:08:15] but that's what he said and you know the
[1:08:18] story
[1:08:19] how that now a few weeks ago maybe a
[1:08:21] month ago before that over on his
[1:08:23] neighbors
[1:08:24] you know right his neighbors uh a woman
[1:08:27] over there and it was either the woman's
[1:08:29] sister or a relative of hers that went
[1:08:30] to the meeting
[1:08:31] and got prayed for amen and took that
[1:08:34] handkerchief but
[1:08:34] i'm saying take that handkerchief go lay
[1:08:36] it on her in the name of the lord she'll
[1:08:37] get well
[1:08:39] she'd come home and hate you for it
[1:08:40] ain't that right amen god completely
[1:08:42] upheld her
[1:08:43] she was bedridden and just about to die
[1:08:49] and and so forth of course uh
[1:08:52] one thing that this man said to brother
[1:08:53] bannon was you know but you know one
[1:08:55] thing
[1:08:56] that i would like to one thing that does
[1:08:58] puzzle me is
[1:08:59] not so long ago there was a preacher
[1:09:00] over here amen and they took that
[1:09:02] handkerchief and that woman i thought
[1:09:03] she was dead but i went over there and
[1:09:04] she was fine eggs or whatever and
[1:09:06] she was perfectly well that's the first
[1:09:08] time he had seen god
[1:09:10] he had never really seen god before amen
[1:09:13] did he begin to testify and brother bob
[1:09:15] says well i led him to preach to me now
[1:09:16] you know you don't mean to tell me she
[1:09:18] was actually healed and come yeah i'm
[1:09:20] telling you
[1:09:21] go over there and talk to her you know
[1:09:24] boy he's a preacher then brother man
[1:09:26] he's preaching to me it got down to the
[1:09:29] simplicity of it
[1:09:31] i mean this god is so simple that we
[1:09:34] miss him
[1:09:39] they're right by the time we see them
[1:09:41] trees the leaves come down and we never
[1:09:42] think
[1:09:43] god you talk to the trees thank you lord
[1:09:46] huh
[1:09:48] and i won't perhaps repeat it but graham
[1:09:50] says you know that even god
[1:09:51] god has a funeral procession amen for
[1:09:53] the lilies and so forth
[1:09:55] we watch him grow we watch him get older
[1:09:57] amen and then we see the leaves fall off
[1:09:59] the
[1:10:00] fall rains cry teardrops of
[1:10:04] of sorrow upon them the cold winter it
[1:10:07] buries him but in all of that
[1:10:08] and then it goes in there and completely
[1:10:10] rots the seed he says if a scientist
[1:10:12] tried to find that germ they couldn't
[1:10:14] find it
[1:10:15] but you let the sun rise you let the sun
[1:10:17] shine and that didn't come
[1:10:18] popping up how many is that going to be
[1:10:20] the resurrection
[1:10:22] well you may die you may be buried but
[1:10:24] when god that sunshine
[1:10:26] is when he realizes he'll call and we'll
[1:10:29] come back forth again
[1:10:30] every season testifies a miracle
[1:10:34] amen so this man he began to preach to
[1:10:37] brother branham
[1:10:39] and brother bam talked about a apple
[1:10:41] tree
[1:10:42] he took the apple tree says you know he
[1:10:45] says you know
[1:10:46] can i have an apple and he grabbed that
[1:10:48] sure have an apple or
[1:10:49] yellow jackets are eating them uh he
[1:10:51] grabbed the album began to eat him and
[1:10:52] so forth
[1:10:53] he says you know he asked the man what
[1:10:56] what
[1:10:56] what makes a tree like this apple tree
[1:10:59] what makes it
[1:11:00] go back the life go back into the roots
[1:11:02] it'll lose its leaves and so forth what
[1:11:04] makes him do that
[1:11:06] and the man said well that's just nature
[1:11:09] isn't that what we choose so many times
[1:11:11] we just think it's just nature
[1:11:13] just like you being here we think well
[1:11:14] i'm just here no you're not here by
[1:11:16] chance
[1:11:17] you're here for a purpose you're here
[1:11:19] for a reason
[1:11:20] i'm preaching this for a purpose i'm
[1:11:21] preaching it for a reason
[1:11:23] i hope our hearts are open to receive it
[1:11:27] amen and so he says listen he says
[1:11:30] that's right
[1:11:31] he says no he says well you know
[1:11:34] it's not just nature well why don't i
[1:11:35] put a bucket of water on the post out
[1:11:37] there and see if it'll go down
[1:11:40] now i know about you but to me i'm like
[1:11:42] as well is there's a metal container
[1:11:43] keep it from going down but that's the
[1:11:45] illustration probably got used
[1:11:48] come to find out he says uh
[1:11:51] you know there's got to be he stresses
[1:11:54] it to the man he says
[1:11:56] oh my how many is looking forward to
[1:12:00] talking to this man
[1:12:01] i forget what his name was but i'm
[1:12:03] looking forward to talking to him
[1:12:04] because i don't know about you but i
[1:12:05] believe you'll be in heaven
[1:12:07] i believe brother brahma actually led
[1:12:09] him to the lord jesus christ
[1:12:10] and his wife remember his wife and later
[1:12:13] on says you know he went a happy man he
[1:12:15] was happy wasn't this ever the same
[1:12:16] again
[1:12:19] he'll be able to tell you i never saw
[1:12:21] god i don't see god no man i didn't sell
[1:12:23] my miracles
[1:12:23] but he actually seen a miracle in me and
[1:12:26] by the way of healing on his neighbor
[1:12:29] but you and i as christians we see god
[1:12:31] everywhere isn't that right
[1:12:32] we see god i see god in you
[1:12:35] i'm looking at a miracle it's a miracle
[1:12:39] that people love god

[1:12:42] really love the lord every time you open
[1:12:44] them doors every time you come in i'm
[1:12:46] looking at a miracle
[1:12:47] every amen every hallelujah i hear i see
[1:12:50] god
[1:12:51] i am sorry i mean please you can see god
[1:12:54] everywhere if you're looking

[1:13:00] he says no it ain't just nature but he
[1:13:04] says you know
[1:13:05] he says you tell me you tell me what
[1:13:09] tells the sap in that tree to go down
[1:13:14] and hide itself so i don't die

[1:13:44] not understand how
[1:13:46] how that god could come down and discern
[1:13:49] the thoughts and tense of the people
[1:13:50] which is a miracle every time
[1:13:53] it's absolutely people will go to
[1:13:55] fortune tellers and hand readers and
[1:13:57] everything else
[1:13:58] they'll probably get enthused when they
[1:13:59] tell them hey you're going to have so
[1:14:00] many children you're going to do this
[1:14:02] that or the other

[1:27:04] so much more of god out there so much
[1:27:07] more of god for us to have this morning
[1:27:09] how many believe there's more for you i
[1:27:12] don't know about you but i believe
[1:27:13] there's more for me
[1:27:14] there's more for you because well i
[1:27:16] don't know about you but i'm looking
[1:27:18] for a greatest miracle of all one of
[1:27:20] these days and that is
[1:27:21] for my atoms to change
[1:27:27] because folks when i walk amongst you'll
[1:27:29] be walking preacher's house maybe
[1:27:31] i mean you're gonna have a long walk out
[1:27:32] there to louis burger and that right
[1:27:34] rather
[1:27:34] that you might want to bring your car
[1:27:36] but and we'll be walking along and
[1:27:38] you'll feel this strange feeling come
[1:27:40] over here
[1:27:42] and the atoms will change but now before
[1:27:45] that happens before
[1:27:46] our atoms actually change i want to know
[1:27:50] that god i want to see all the miracles
[1:27:52] that god does in my life
[1:27:54] i could sit here and tell you many
[1:27:55] different miracles that god's already
[1:27:57] done
[1:27:58] but i want to be in a place to where i
[1:27:59] see god in every part of my life
[1:28:02] is that right in every part of my life i
[1:28:06] want to see god
[1:28:07] amen and know that when you pray and see
[1:28:09] god come and fulfill that
[1:28:11] just to take it for granted or most of
[1:28:14] the time this is the sad part
[1:28:16] not even see it i mean it was a whole
[1:28:19] world what we just talked about this
[1:28:20] morning the world don't even hardly see
[1:28:22] it
[1:28:23] they think we come from monkeys and a
[1:28:25] big bang theory you know it just
[1:28:26] happened
[1:28:28] brother brandon talking about the
[1:28:29] miracle of creation he began to talk
[1:28:30] about a ball
[1:28:31] that you throw up in the air and then he
[1:28:33] says and you throw that ball up in the
[1:28:34] air
[1:28:35] he says and never will that one ball
[1:28:36] make a revolution in the same spot
[1:28:40] never will it make it a revolution it'll
[1:28:42] always be moving either up
[1:28:43] or down he says but this ball
[1:28:46] this ball of the earth it makes a
[1:28:48] perfect revolution every time
[1:28:50] and he stays right there because if we
[1:28:52] got closer to the salmon all things went
[1:28:54] bad
[1:28:55] ain't no shooting stars he says or
[1:28:57] falling sausage if those stars got
[1:28:58] another place the whole thing would be
[1:29:00] out of cater
[1:29:01] but that all holds and people should
[1:29:03] really amen
[1:29:04] just praise god said we know that god
[1:29:06] had to be god had to make it
[1:29:09] but they're so blind in their hearts
[1:29:13] their hearts are so closed till they
[1:29:15] don't see it
[1:29:18] that's why we thought lord help us to
[1:29:20] see when god blesses you
[1:29:21] amen with the next meal when he blesses
[1:29:24] you with being able to have clothes
[1:29:26] amen have a nice car to drive say thank
[1:29:28] you lord jesus
[1:29:30] realize it's god god providing brother
[1:29:33] amen providing a job amen
[1:29:35] people that need a job and whatever it
[1:29:36] might be
[1:29:38] healing you need healing god is there
[1:29:40] for you
[1:29:41] but you got to open your heart up to
[1:29:43] receive it
[1:29:45] amen let's do one more and that is talk
[1:29:48] about
[1:29:48] opening our heart listen to this
[1:29:52] now we take like the key of knowledge
[1:29:55] a man has to if he's trying to
[1:29:57] accumulate knowledge there's a key to
[1:29:59] that
[1:30:00] there's a way that man has to open up
[1:30:03] all right he says no one can learn him
[1:30:07] they might teach him but he has to learn
[1:30:11] amen how many teachers tries to show you
[1:30:13] something get you
[1:30:14] to learn but there's a key to opening up
[1:30:18] your mind and learning what is being
[1:30:20] said the only way that can be done
[1:30:22] he has to catch that key that's
[1:30:25] something in there
[1:30:26] that unfolds
[1:30:33] something that unfolds
[1:30:39] because jesus gave us this to open up
[1:30:42] our hearts to
[1:30:45] then came the disciples to jesus apart
[1:30:47] and said why could not we cast them out
[1:30:50] and jesus said unto them because of your
[1:30:52] unbelief
[1:30:54] for verily i say unto you if you had the
[1:30:56] faith of the grain of the mustard seed
[1:30:58] you should say to this mountain remove
[1:31:01] hands
[1:31:01] to younger place and it shall remove
[1:31:05] and nothing shall be impossible
[1:31:08] unto you how many say lord
[1:31:12] open up my heart nothing shall be
[1:31:15] impossible to you
[1:31:17] that's something that unfolds reveals
[1:31:19] him now notice like mathematics there's
[1:31:21] a key to mathematics
[1:31:23] you just have to get the hang of it i've
[1:31:26] seen men
[1:31:27] that could take four rows of figures and
[1:31:29] i won't never forget brother billy
[1:31:31] but billy last one time he i watched him
[1:31:33] do figures brother john's probably got
[1:31:35] it himself
[1:31:36] to where you can he could just take
[1:31:37] numbers and he could just
[1:31:39] add it up and just i'm like how did he
[1:31:41] come up with that number
[1:31:43] you know it's just you know but you just
[1:31:45] found that key
[1:31:47] could take four row figures and put
[1:31:50] their fingers
[1:31:51] each one of those fingers down that row
[1:31:53] of those figures figures
[1:31:55] and just come right on down like that
[1:31:57] maybe six figures deep
[1:31:59] and put the answer at the bottom
[1:32:01] figuring four rows at a time
[1:32:03] everywhere from that one from one to
[1:32:06] nine anywhere from one to nine
[1:32:08] he says i have a hard time figuring one
[1:32:10] row unless i have enough fingers and
[1:32:12] toes to count
[1:32:16] to get that one row figured out i just
[1:32:20] never could get find that key but you
[1:32:21] see
[1:32:22] some of them just has the key to it and
[1:32:24] know how to do it
[1:32:26] amen
[1:32:29] see there's a key to knowledge a man
[1:32:33] after knowledge
[1:32:34] there's a key to science and researchers
[1:32:37] there's a great key amen and then he
[1:32:40] goes to talk about the adam and so forth
[1:32:42] but listen
[1:32:43] there's only one door to healing and
[1:32:46] jesus is that door
[1:32:47] there's only one door to peace he says
[1:32:50] my peace i give unto you
[1:32:52] he's the only door to genuine
[1:32:56] peace
[1:33:02] i thought about something in the world
[1:33:03] that we're living in
[1:33:05] one place the bible says he that hateth
[1:33:07] me
[1:33:08] loveth death you know people don't love
[1:33:12] god do they
[1:33:13] they put love god our nation put love
[1:33:16] they put god out
[1:33:17] which means they love hate now they have
[1:33:21] hate
[1:33:23] and they got a whole lot of hate because
[1:33:26] they hated love
[1:33:29] amen jesus the only door
[1:33:33] now listen there's only one
[1:33:36] and that's jesus jesus he is our healing
[1:33:39] i am the lord thy god that heals
[1:33:42] all of thy diseases he is the door to
[1:33:44] heaven there's no other door
[1:33:46] and no other way but through jesus
[1:33:48] christ he is the door to heaven
[1:33:50] and now jesus is the door to all these
[1:33:53] things
[1:33:54] and faith is the key that unlocks the
[1:33:57] door
[1:33:58] now jesus is the door and all these
[1:34:00] promises of god
[1:34:02] faith in his finished work unlocks every
[1:34:05] door
[1:34:06] to every treasure there is inside the
[1:34:09] kingdom of god
[1:34:11] amen praise be to god
[1:34:14] amen i believe in the full gospel
[1:34:18] every word of god that turns the power
[1:34:21] of god loose that turns
[1:34:22] his blessings to the people it's the key
[1:34:25] to the door that unlocks
[1:34:27] like all these great heroes
[1:34:30] amen how we could go on like math i mean
[1:34:34] uh hebrews 12 talking about all the
[1:34:36] great heroes we won't take too much time
[1:34:38] but
[1:34:38] talking about all the great heroes where
[1:34:39] it was absolute god's
[1:34:42] miracle take a little david and a glass
[1:34:46] how many knows it wasn't david
[1:34:49] it was god it was a miracle they
[1:34:52] witnessed
[1:34:53] a miracle the three hebrew children god
[1:34:56] took the
[1:34:58] heat out of the fire was still there it
[1:35:00] was burning
[1:35:01] but god took the heat out
[1:35:05] hallelujah how many believes that god
[1:35:07] can take the heat out of your trial
[1:35:10] he can take it out he can just make it
[1:35:12] of none of none effect amen
[1:35:14] he can take it he can do things like
[1:35:16] that i believe he says same yesterday
[1:35:18] today and forever
[1:35:20] and brother brown he said one place god
[1:35:21] loves to show his power
[1:35:23] i mean god loves to do miracles not just
[1:35:26] in supplying for you not just in healing
[1:35:28] you not just in protecting you
[1:35:31] but in having a relationship with you
[1:35:34] having fellowship with you
[1:35:36] have an intimate relationship with god
[1:35:43] amen i love the lord don't you love the
[1:35:46] lord
[1:35:47] are you glad to be walking with the lord
[1:35:49] i'm just glad for the comfort of the
[1:35:51] holy spirit
[1:35:52] my comfort i leave you not as the world
[1:35:54] gives they don't have much comfort
[1:35:56] but i give you a comfort that is just
[1:35:58] unspeakable
[1:36:00] to know that you're a part of me i'm a
[1:36:02] part of you
[1:36:04] amen god one day called
[1:36:08] you he called me said son
[1:36:12] where are you son where are you
[1:36:16] and i heard him when i was down in
[1:36:18] pancraft sarasota when the lord poached
[1:36:20] on my heart said son
[1:36:22] son how many knows if i wouldn't have
[1:36:24] been silent i probably never heard it
[1:36:26] no never heard it but if you're a son
[1:36:29] you hear that call
[1:36:31] let me tell you something and i want to
[1:36:32] say this in in my own life
[1:36:34] when god god cares about the intricate
[1:36:36] parts of your life
[1:36:39] and you should still every day hear the
[1:36:41] holy spirit
[1:36:42] speaking to you the things that you have
[1:36:44] need of
[1:36:45] god wants to have fellowship but he did
[1:36:48] and he did a miracle in my life
[1:36:50] and it changed me from the man that i
[1:36:53] once was to born again experience
[1:36:56] how do you know he was born again
[1:36:59] well i'll tell you how i know better
[1:37:02] sean
[1:37:03] how i know is because god has begun to
[1:37:07] work
[1:37:09] if he begins at work he'll finish it
[1:37:14] and i'm not done yet but we're still go
[1:37:16] on the course
[1:37:18] he's helped me he's held you
[1:37:21] that's how you know because if you just
[1:37:24] go off and out
[1:37:25] father god said you never really had
[1:37:26] anything maybe you had emotion
[1:37:28] huh maybe you had it on the outside
[1:37:30] flesh but when god doesn't work in here
[1:37:32] it's a paradox you become from a
[1:37:35] creature of time to a creature of
[1:37:36] eternity
[1:37:40] i love to think about in a million years
[1:37:44] coming and shaking y'all's hands isn't
