[44:44] Amen. Let's just bow our heads and pray.
[44:46] Lord Jesus, we come before you tonight
[44:48] thankful, Lord, once again to gather
[44:49] ourselves together in your name, Lord.
[44:52] And Father, how precious it is to know
[44:54] that you promised 2,000 years ago, Lord.
[44:57] And you have kept your promise for 2,000
[44:59] years that wherever two or three were
[45:01] gathered in your name, there you would
[45:03] be in our midst, Lord Jesus. And we're
[45:05] so grateful to have you in our midst,
[45:06] Lord. Father, we thank you, Lord, for
[45:08] the leadership of the Holy Spirit in our
[45:10] lives, Lord. Knowing, Father, that it is
[45:12] the comfort of our life, Lord. It is
[45:14] security of our life. You're all to us.
[45:16] You mean everything to us, Lord. And
[45:18] that's why we've gathered on this
[45:20] Wednesday night, Lord. Come from near
[45:21] and far, assembled in your house, Lord.
[45:24] Took time apart, Father. Set this time
[45:26] apart, Lord, to come to worship you in
[45:28] spirit and in truth. Lord, come to the
[45:30] open doors, Lord Jesus. Our hunger, our
[45:33] heart hungers for more of you, Lord.
[45:36] Thirsts for more of you, Lord. In a dry
[45:38] and a thirsty, Lord land, Lord. We know
[45:40] there's a spring of water bubbling up,
[45:43] Lord Jesus. A fountain, Lord, to get
[45:45] quench every one of our thirsts, Lord.
[45:47] Meaning, Father, if we have need of
[45:49] healing, Lord, we can be healed. If we
[45:50] have need of salvation, we can drink
[45:53] salvation, Lord. Whatever it is that we
[45:54] have need of, Lord, we can come to that
[45:57] fountain and drink and be filled and go
[45:59] from here, Lord Jesus, satisfied. We're
[46:02] so grateful, God, for a place that we
[46:04] can come that we can eat and drink and
[46:06] be satisfied when the world is groping.
[46:08] Father, they're eating and drinking and
[46:10] can't never get satisfied, never happy,
[46:12] Lord. Father, I ask, God, that you'll
[46:14] just bless this service tonight. Bless
[46:17] the meditation of our hearts and that
[46:18] which we feel you've laid upon our
[46:20] hearts to minister. We ask for your
[46:22] strength, the strength of the Holy
[46:24] Spirit, God, tonight, Lord, to minister
[46:25] your word. Bless it now, Father, in
[46:28] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Remember
[46:30] Mike and Grace. They're not feeling so
[46:32] well tonight, so we want to remember
[46:34] them in prayer. Amen. And of course,
[46:37] Brother Glenn, he is taking a little bit
[46:39] longer to recoup. Amen. He's pretty
[46:42] young man yet, so hopefully it won't
[46:44] take long, but Amen. We are uh amen
[46:48] thankful for the progress that he's had
[46:51] but amen some of times that is really
[46:54] amen he can hang on pretty hard. Amen.
[46:57] And so we just pray the Lord will rebuke
[47:00] that sickness and that he would amen
[47:02] come back to church chipper and with a
[47:04] big smile as he always has. Amen. Praise
[47:07] the Lord. Turn your Bibles if you you
[47:09] will to Romans the first chapter. Romans
[47:11] 1.
[47:22] Romans 1
[47:29] verse 20.
[47:38] For the invisible things of him from the
[47:40] creation of the world are clearly seen,
[47:42] being understood by the things that are
[47:45] made, even his eternal power and
[47:47] godhead, so that they are without
[47:50] excuse.
[47:51] Now turn, if you will me, to the book of
[47:53] Luke, Luke 14.
[48:01] Amen. This is a quote that I didn't get
[48:03] to Sunday. off that quote that I didn't
[48:06] get to. We just want to kind of kind of
[48:08] continue. Amen. And take and see what
[48:11] the Lord will have for us.
[48:17] Amen. This could also be part two to the
[48:20] message that we preached about a week
[48:22] ago on arrived. Arrived.
[48:26] Amen. Luke chapter 14 verse 15 it says
[48:33] the parable about heaven's banquet and
[48:36] when one of them that sat at meat with
[48:38] him heard these things he said unto him
[48:41] blessed is he that shall sit sit and eat
[48:43] bread shall eat bread in the kingdom of
[48:45] God. Then he said he unto him, a certain
[48:48] man, made a great supper, and bade many,
[48:51] and his and sent his servants at supper
[48:53] time to say to them that were bidden,
[48:56] come for all things are now ready. And
[49:00] they all with one consent began to make
[49:02] excuse. And the first one said, I have
[49:04] bought a piece of ground. I must need go
[49:07] and see it. I pray thee have me excused.
[49:10] Another one said, I have bought five
[49:12] yolk of oxen, and I must go and prove
[49:14] them. I pray thee have me excused.
[49:16] Another one said, I have married a wife
[49:18] and therefore I cannot come. So that
[49:20] servant came and showed his lord the
[49:22] things. Then the master of the house
[49:24] being angry said to his servants, "Go
[49:26] out quickly into the streets into the
[49:27] lanes in the city and bring either the
[49:29] poor, the maim, the halt, the blind."
[49:32] And the servant said, "Lord, it is done
[49:34] as thou has commanded, and yet there is
[49:36] room." And the Lord said unto the
[49:38] servant, "Go into the highways and the
[49:40] hedges, and compel them to come in that
[49:42] my house may be filled. For I say unto
[49:44] you that none of those men which were
[49:46] bidden shall taste of my supper. May God
[49:49] add his blessings to the reading of the
[49:50] word tonight. You can be seated.
[49:53] Tonight's title is going to be
[49:58] no excuses.
[50:00] No excuses. Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:13] Brother Bram says, "Brother, one of
[50:15] these days the last Holy Ghost anointed
[50:18] gospel sermon will be preached. One of
[50:21] these days the last gun will fire. One
[50:23] of these days the last song will be
[50:25] sung.
[50:27] One of these days the last prayer will
[50:30] be prayed. One of these days the doors
[50:32] of the tabernacle will be closed for the
[50:34] last time. The Bible will be closed on
[50:37] the pulpit and you'll stand in the
[50:39] presence of God to give an account for
[50:41] what you've heard tonight. What then?
[50:43] What then? When the great book is open,
[50:46] what then?
[50:47] When tonight comes on record, what then?
[50:50] As the song says, what then? When the
[50:53] great book is open, what then? When the
[50:56] ones that's rejected the Savior today
[50:58] will be asked to give a reason. What
[51:00] then? But Abam says, "Your job stood in
[51:04] the in your way. Your parents stood in
[51:07] your way. Your boyfriend stood in your
[51:10] way. Your girlfriend stood in your way.
[51:12] Or your church stood in the way." And
[51:14] then Brother Brandon preached the whole
[51:15] thing again. And he only this time he
[51:18] says message. When the ones that's
[51:20] rejected this message tonight, you're
[51:22] going to be asked to give a reason.
[51:26] To give a reason.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; What then? Amen.
[51:33] Praise the Lord.
[51:36] So, we're just living in that day and
[51:38] happy to be a Christian. Oh my. What
[51:41] could I do? I believe I'd go wild if I
[51:43] wasn't a Christian looking at the thing.
[51:45] I don't see how people can stand it. I
[51:47] just don't understand how a man can walk
[51:50] on earth today without being a
[51:52] Christian. I wish anybody would give me
[51:55] a reason, some reason why not to serve
[51:59] Christ.
[52:00] You can't give a sensible reason.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:13] See,
[52:14] now why? That's the question.
[52:18] There's no one has a better right to ask
[52:21] it than God. Y'all remember the message
[52:22] called why?
[52:25] Amen. Talking about why is the daughter
[52:27] of my people not healed? Is there no D
[52:28] bomb in Gilead? Is there no physician
[52:30] there? Amen. God asks why. In other
[52:34] words, give me a reason.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me a reason.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:46] And he asked in it in the next test text
[52:49] he says tonight if God was if God makes
[52:52] a way of escape for the people to escape
[52:54] a horrible thing or sickness or death or
[52:58] eternal death and then the people fail
[53:01] to receive receive it. God asks why why
[53:06] didn't you do it?
[53:09] Now, that's going to be a great thing on
[53:10] the day of judgment when God is going to
[53:12] ask we tonight that's assembled here
[53:16] that will not accept him as our savior
[53:18] and be filled with his spirit. Why
[53:21] didn't you do it? Why? And we're going
[53:23] to have to give an answer for it. That's
[53:26] right. We're going to answer for every
[53:29] word that God has written. Why didn't
[53:31] you? Why? and listens. And you'll have
[53:35] no excuses
[53:38] &gt;&gt; on that day.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; You'll have no excuses on that day.
[53:46] You know, I was thinking about no
[53:47] excuses. No excuses. And I I really
[53:50] wanted to pull that quote up where
[53:53] brother Bam talked about over in uh
[53:55] foreign lands. And you all remember when
[53:56] he went over there and how it they would
[53:58] go by and I guess he called them
[54:00] salamanders or almost like a dump truck
[54:02] and they would pick out pick up all the
[54:04] dead bodies of bums and so forth that
[54:06] were on the street and they would throw
[54:08] them in that salamander. You'd never see
[54:09] them again. There was no prayer. There
[54:11] was no funerals
[54:13] that right? No. No. No. And he says he
[54:17] says and here we are in America fussing
[54:19] about doctrines and this that or the
[54:20] other. our little petty stuff when
[54:22] there's thousands and tens of thousands
[54:25] of people dying never hearing John 3:16
[54:29] never hearing about the Savior.
[54:32] Ain't that right? And I thought I would
[54:35] ask if there was one excuse not to
[54:37] accept God, can somebody tell me what
[54:40] that would be?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; That's the only excuse, brother David.
[54:46] The only excuse that I could think of
[54:48] and only God will be the judge on that
[54:50] day is if you never heard the story, you
[54:54] never heard the gospel.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; How many knows then? Yeah, maybe you'd
[54:58] have an excuse because brother Bam said
[55:00] God is obligated to give everybody at
[55:02] least one chance. Ain't that right?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; And God will be the judge of that. But
[55:06] if you've ever heard the story, Amen. Oh
[55:10] my.
[55:11] If I was President Trump up here
[55:13] tonight, y'all would have ears to hear.
[55:16] We We listen to what the man's got to
[55:17] say.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[55:21] Or the king of England or any great man.
[55:24] We You listen to what he's got to say.
[55:25] But do you realize the preacher
[55:27] preaching the word of God, it is a whole
[55:29] lot more authority than what any man
[55:31] could ever say. Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And people listening out there
[55:35] streaming, if they hear this one time
[55:37] that Jesus Christ died for you on
[55:39] Calvary, so you don't have to be lost.
[55:42] If that crosses your ears, that's all
[55:45] God's obligated, that one time. And you
[55:47] will give an account for what you have
[55:48] heard on that day.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; You'll be asked to give a reason why
[55:54] what is. In other words, he's asking for
[55:56] your excuse.
[55:59] He's going to ask what excuse do you
[56:01] have or what reason? What's the reason
[56:04] for you not accepting the Lord Jesus
[56:06] Christ?
[56:09] &gt;&gt; And that reason is the excuse.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Wow. Right.
[56:15] So, everybody will be asked a reason
[56:18] why. My my my and this excuse thing goes
[56:22] a long way with us. Amen. because we who
[56:25] know a lot are accountable for a lot.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; And so I want to try to cover this
[56:31] vastly scope of it a little bit and then
[56:33] perhaps try to get it down a little bit
[56:35] more about where we live at and why we
[56:37] make excuses.
[56:40] Amen. Sometimes we make excuses.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; People that don't come to church on
[56:44] Wednesday, you made an excuse for
[56:46] yourself.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; You had some reason. There was a reason
[56:49] why you didn't come when the doors were
[56:52] open.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; True. said, "But if you really got God
[56:55] on the inside, you can't wait for them
[56:57] to What's your excuse?"
[57:00] &gt;&gt; What's your reason?
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you your reason after a
[57:04] while.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] Amen. Sunday, I talked about as old
[57:13] folks how that we were get up to 60, 70,
[57:15] 80 years old. You know, we're about
[57:17] done.
[57:18] And I didn't mean necessarily we're
[57:20] about gone, even though we are.
[57:25] [Laughter]
[57:27] I didn't know if I got old folks mad or
[57:29] not, but I'm in 63, so I'm in that
[57:31] category, so I don't really care. I'm
[57:33] talking about myself. If you don't like
[57:34] it, that's just bad.
[57:42] But done as in the Lord working on you.
[57:47] Amen. We sing that song. How does it go?
[57:50] Don't judge me. God isn't finished with
[57:52] me yet. How many believe God's still
[57:54] working on me?
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll always be working on me, but
[57:58] we're wanting God to come down closer to
[58:01] the finish.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Getting done with you. Amen. We
[58:04] ought to be like we was 20 years ago. We
[58:07] ought to act like we did it 20 and 30
[58:09] and 40 and 50.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Some of us ain't even 50 yet. He ain't
[58:14] even acting like a 50 year old yet.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[58:20] Young people, aren't you glad to be
[58:22] happy? Glad to be happy. Young, I can't
[58:25] even remember to talk right
[58:28] think. Thank God if you can think right.
[58:32] Amen. God is good, isn't he? All right.
[58:35] So, we look at this and we realize that
[58:37] God has made every provision
[58:42] for man. He has given us when he said it
[58:45] is finished on Calvary. come knows that
[58:48] everything you ever have need of, it
[58:50] doesn't matter what we, everything that
[58:52] you have need of was provided then. It
[58:55] was paid for.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; So, it's no more God's fault. He did his
[59:00] part. Now, we have to do ours.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; And we will.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Aren't you glad that judgment
[59:08] begins at the house of God?
[59:11] &gt;&gt; And you'll have to give a reason here
[59:12] for the way that you do things. or
[59:14] you'll have to give a reason over there
[59:16] for the way that you do things. Sooner
[59:18] or later, you will have to give an
[59:20] account for the way that you do things
[59:21] and why you do things and why you didn't
[59:24] do things.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought, you know, we say that a
[59:28] judgment day that every wrong will be
[59:31] made right. Isn't that right?
[59:35] Can you imagine? There's not a murder.
[59:37] There is nothing. There is not Oh my,
[59:39] here we go. There's not even any idle
[59:42] word that a man can speak but what you
[59:44] give an account for. In other words,
[59:47] he'll gonna make all the wrongs right.
[59:50] You mean he's going to righten this
[59:52] whole thing? Yeah. Yeah. See the judges,
[59:54] they ain't no they don't bring justice.
[59:56] But this God, he will bring justice. He
[59:59] will make the wrongs right. Ain't nobody
[1:00:02] getting away with nothing.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; So you can judge yourself here. I love
[1:00:06] where brother says you are your own
[1:00:08] judge. God don't judge you. God don't
[1:00:10] send you to hell. You are here. Amen.
[1:00:12] And you judge yourself whether you're
[1:00:14] worthy or not.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; You are your own judge.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; You send yourself to hell or heaven.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; By thy words, thou shalt be condemned or
[1:00:24] thou shalt be saved.
[1:00:25] Whatever you confess,
[1:00:42] thank the Lord for water and a cool fan.
[1:00:47] Amen. I like that little thing. Praise
[1:00:50] the Lord. All right. I love that.
[1:00:57] Think about it.
[1:01:01] How many knows that the whole world and
[1:01:03] everybody that hears the gospel, Amen,
[1:01:07] is forced to a decision.
[1:01:10] Even the prophet of God said the
[1:01:12] decision is forced upon people. You have
[1:01:15] to make a choice.
[1:01:18] Once it comes to your ear, once you hear
[1:01:21] it, you become responsible for it.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would we not accept it? Oh my.
[1:01:32] Let me don't go down this rabbit hole,
[1:01:34] but I'm here to tell you right now, how
[1:01:35] many is glad to be a Christian?
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a Christian. I'm with the
[1:01:40] prophet of God. How could you go through
[1:01:42] this world, Amen, knowing that just any
[1:01:44] time the nukes could go up into the air?
[1:01:46] Amen. This thing could be obliterated.
[1:01:49] There's no hopes for this world. Amen.
[1:01:53] They don't have no peace. You wouldn't
[1:01:54] have no peace. You wouldn't have no joy
[1:01:57] if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; I thank God that he saved me and that he
[1:02:01] called me and that we received Christ.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; So, let's check out this reason. Praise
[1:02:08] the Lord. You know even uh Jesus I
[1:02:12] believe it was
[1:02:16] he asked the disciples one time he says
[1:02:19] who do men say that I the son of man am
[1:02:21] and they oh say some Elias some Isaiah
[1:02:24] or this different prophets or they say
[1:02:26] this one or that one but who who do you
[1:02:27] say that I am
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; I mean I was they had to make a choice
[1:02:31] of who they thought it was
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; what do you think of this tell me a
[1:02:37] reason give me a reason and who you Who
[1:02:39] think it? Who do you think it was? How
[1:02:42] many knows that even some of them
[1:02:43] thought it was Beelzebub? They judged
[1:02:45] him as Beelzebub
[1:02:50] because they had to make a choice on
[1:02:51] what they thought it was.
[1:02:54] And then once they're faced with the
[1:02:56] truth, Jesus says, "Unless you believe
[1:02:58] that I am he, you will die in your
[1:03:00] unbelief. You will die in your sins."
[1:03:05] Another one time they were asking him a
[1:03:07] bunch of question. He says John's
[1:03:10] ministry, he said, "What was it of? Was
[1:03:12] it of God or was it of man?" And they
[1:03:16] dare not ask him the answer because if
[1:03:18] they say that it was of man, amen, the
[1:03:20] people are going to say, "No, no, no,
[1:03:21] no. John was of God."
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; And then if they say John was of God,
[1:03:27] then they didn't repent.
[1:03:30] Then they condemned themselves. So they
[1:03:31] say, "We can't answer. Neither will I
[1:03:33] answer you." He said,
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; "Put him on the spot. make a choice.
[1:03:39] How many believes that I don't know if
[1:03:41] you can do it, but zoom in over here,
[1:03:43] will you with the camera?
[1:03:45] How many believe that in this generation
[1:03:47] it's the same thing? People have to
[1:03:50] decide what do you think of this?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Make your choice. Do you think that's a
[1:03:56] fake pillar of fire on his head? Do you
[1:03:59] think he's a false prophet? Do you
[1:04:01] really believe the story? That's that
[1:04:03] the only picture that was came out of
[1:04:05] many out of a critic's camera
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; and that's the actual pillar of fire.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; What do you believe? Do you believe this
[1:04:14] message is of God or do you believe it's
[1:04:17] of man?
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Make a choice cuz God's going to ask you
[1:04:22] what you did with it one day.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And he'll ask you why that you made the
[1:04:27] choice that you did. Because there'll be
[1:04:29] a lot of people giving all kinds of
[1:04:31] excuses on the judgment day. Well, my
[1:04:33] church didn't teach that. Well, I just
[1:04:35] don't believe that. That's not according
[1:04:37] to my faith.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; And it ain't going to bear well water.
[1:04:42] He going to hold wo water. Hello. It's
[1:04:44] going to not going to be a good enough
[1:04:46] excuse. God came and he proved it over
[1:04:49] and over and over and over again.
[1:04:58] so that they are without excuse.
[1:05:01] Amen.
[1:05:03] Praise be to God.
[1:05:06] In another instance, he talks about
[1:05:14] certain scribes of the f and the
[1:05:17] Pharisees answered saying, "Master, we
[1:05:19] would see a sign from thee." Amen. And
[1:05:22] he answered and said unto them, "An evil
[1:05:25] and adulter
[1:05:26] evil and adulterous generation seeketh
[1:05:29] after a sign, and there shall be no sign
[1:05:31] given it, but the sign of the prophet
[1:05:32] Jonas. For as Jonas was in the days of
[1:05:35] uh in three days and three nights in the
[1:05:37] whale's belly, so shall the Son of Man
[1:05:39] be three days and three nights in the
[1:05:40] heart of the earth." Really, I could
[1:05:42] have just went to 41. The men of Nineveh
[1:05:45] shall rise in judgment with this
[1:05:47] generation and shall condemn it because
[1:05:51] they repented at the preaching of Jonas.
[1:05:54] And behold, a greater than Jonas is
[1:05:56] here. Can you imagine the men of
[1:05:59] Nineveh? They're going to rise in
[1:06:00] judgment. Say, "Why didn't you believe
[1:06:02] him? All we had is a man coming out of a
[1:06:06] fish's mouth and we believed him. But
[1:06:08] here you had a man raising the dead,
[1:06:10] healing the sick, and you wouldn't
[1:06:12] believe. You a bunch of stubborn
[1:06:13] hardheaded people. How many of people
[1:06:16] are hard-headed, stiff necked? Stephen
[1:06:19] said, "Oh, you stiff necked and
[1:06:21] uncircumcised of harden the earth. How
[1:06:24] you resist the Holy Ghost?
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; They took up stones and stones, Stephen.
[1:06:29] Don't you think they're going to have to
[1:06:30] give an answer? Why did they do it? We
[1:06:33] did it because we were jealous."
[1:06:36] Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; No matter how righteous they thought
[1:06:39] that they were,
[1:06:41] they'll be asked to give a reason.
[1:06:44] What's your excuse?
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; What about the rich young man story?
[1:06:51] Man, people prosper and prosper and
[1:06:53] money becomes their god.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:06:57] And he give the story of him being in
[1:06:59] hell. Then you're find your soul lifted
[1:07:01] up and Amen. and his love was with his
[1:07:04] money, with his prosperity. Nothing
[1:07:06] wrong with that if God blesses you in
[1:07:08] that way. But make sure it doesn't get
[1:07:11] you between you and God.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Or it's an idol and it's evil.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; So many stories we we have no excuse.
[1:07:20] How many know we have no excuse? The
[1:07:23] world don't have an excuse.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Don't give God no excuse.
[1:07:35] Or should I say, don't give God no
[1:07:37] excuse. No, I think it ought to be
[1:07:39] yelled just a little bit.
[1:07:42] Why? If you want to be so hard-hearted,
[1:07:45] you won't receive God, won't accept
[1:07:47] Christ and what he did after what he did
[1:07:50] for you on Calvary.
[1:07:54] We as Christians, there's one thing for
[1:07:56] sure. People can go out there on the
[1:07:57] streets and they can mock Christ.
[1:08:02] I don't know if y'all watched YouTube
[1:08:04] any, but
[1:08:06] Azie Osborne died not so long ago, the
[1:08:08] prince of darkness, and they've got him
[1:08:11] up in heaven here. He ate bats, had dark
[1:08:15] uh symbols of darkness and everything
[1:08:17] represented darkness. They've got him up
[1:08:19] there with doves and clouds and angels.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; You reckon that's where he is? Down
[1:08:25] here, he's got bats and devils
[1:08:27] everywhere. And now they got him flying
[1:08:29] around in the heavens. You talk about
[1:08:30] deceiving to those who followed.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:08:35] No. My my my.
[1:08:38] That's right. What I wanted to say is
[1:08:41] God is not mocked, friends.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Who knows? God is not mocked. Judgment
[1:08:45] day, like brother Bam said, that day is
[1:08:47] coming when the books are open.
[1:08:52] Amen. So there's another just one of one
[1:08:55] of different ones. The men of Nine of
[1:08:58] Queen of Sheba shall rise. Ain't that
[1:09:00] right? She came from the furthermost
[1:09:03] parts of the earth, so to speak, to come
[1:09:05] to hear the wisdom of Solomon to see his
[1:09:08] discernment.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And he says a greater
[1:09:12] than Solomon is here.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. And a greater
[1:09:16] than Solomon is here. When our prophet
[1:09:19] when he came when he preached a greater
[1:09:21] than Solomon here, he says a greater
[1:09:23] than all is here. Christ himself is here
[1:09:27] doing the very same things again and
[1:09:29] you'll give an account for that.
[1:09:35] You'll have to give a reason why you
[1:09:37] rejected. How many know Brother Bam says
[1:09:39] these tapes will meet this generation on
[1:09:42] judgment day.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. Those quotes, these
[1:09:45] quotes, the ministry, the preaching,
[1:09:47] it'll meet this whole generation from
[1:09:49] the 1900s on at the judgment day.
[1:09:54] Now read it. I don't know if I could
[1:09:57] find it real quick or not.
[1:10:08] Brother Bam says,
[1:10:12] "I know I've got to stand in the last
[1:10:14] days at the resurrection with this
[1:10:16] generation of people and to give an
[1:10:18] account for this word." And the Holy
[1:10:20] Spirit showing this to me, preaching out
[1:10:23] yonder, where are you going to stand?
[1:10:26] How are you going to get by with it? You
[1:10:29] can't do it, friend. Amen.
[1:10:34] That's right. Preaching the word.
[1:10:37] Nobody's going to get by with anything.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:43] Hallelujah.
[1:10:47] God is good.
[1:11:00] Amen.
[1:11:04] So that's a generational
[1:11:07] generational call. A generation that's
[1:11:11] going to give have to give a reason
[1:11:16] for why they didn't accept the truth of
[1:11:18] the word.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] And I'd like to with the help of the
[1:11:24] Lord, let's look at oursel a little bit.
[1:11:27] How many knows a lot of times we make
[1:11:29] excuses for ourselves? Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's very easy to make excuses,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; to try to make excuses for things.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; But a preached a message. It's called
[1:11:44] What was the Holy Ghost given for?
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; What was he given for?
[1:11:52] Well, let's just look at it for a
[1:11:54] minute. He says, "I was talking of the
[1:11:56] power of prayer, the power of speech,
[1:11:59] the power of a holy life." Amen. That's
[1:12:01] what the Holy Ghost is to do. Some of
[1:12:04] you people walking along saying, "I just
[1:12:06] can't quit
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; drinking. I just can't quit this." He
[1:12:14] said, "The Holy Ghost comes to live in
[1:12:16] you to make these cats get away from
[1:12:20] you."
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many knows if you
[1:12:25] haven't arrived where you ought to be? I
[1:12:27] I really wish I could pull that quote up
[1:12:29] because I remember preaching on it and I
[1:12:30] know brother Bam mentioned it and even
[1:12:32] even if he didn't, I could make the
[1:12:34] statement that why do we wish for things
[1:12:37] that has been bought and paid for?
[1:12:40] There's no need for wishing for things
[1:12:42] anymore.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to know there's no there's no
[1:12:49] waiting for things anymore.
[1:12:51] They had to wait at the day of Pentecost
[1:12:53] for 11 day. Wait till you're endued with
[1:12:55] power from on high. But brother Bam says
[1:12:58] since the Holy Ghost has come, there's
[1:13:00] not any waiting anymore. You can receive
[1:13:03] things right there in your seat right
[1:13:05] now if you really want it.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; And the word can't shouldn't be in our
[1:13:12] vocabulary.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a word the devil tries to
[1:13:16] tell you. You can't do it. You can't do
[1:13:18] it. I know you can't. But if you'll
[1:13:20] surrender yourself to God, God will do
[1:13:23] it.
[1:13:26] Oh my, I'm here to tell you, no, without
[1:13:28] the Holy Ghost, you can't. But yes, with
[1:13:30] the Holy Ghost, all things are possible.
[1:13:33] I'm here to tell you tonight, I believe
[1:13:35] tonight that what we all need more of is
[1:13:37] more of the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you get the Holy Ghost, you'll
[1:13:42] act like the Holy Ghost. You'll follow
[1:13:43] the Holy Ghost. You'll do what the Holy
[1:13:46] Ghost says.
[1:13:48] And if you're not,
[1:13:51] if you're not doing it, then you ain't
[1:13:53] got the Holy Ghost the way you ought to
[1:13:54] have.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You're still making excuses for
[1:13:57] yourself.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm going to talk to everybody
[1:14:03] tonight and including myself for sure.
[1:14:06] Hello.
[1:14:10] Oh my. This is a quote I didn't get to
[1:14:12] Sunday. So, this is where we'll take
[1:14:13] off. Can't quit drinking. These can'ts
[1:14:16] get away from you. That's right. It'll
[1:14:19] make women stop cutting their hair.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Men, quit wearing shorts and slacks. No
[1:14:27] excuses, Brother Ram says. Don't give me
[1:14:30] no excuse.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just struggled with that. You're
[1:14:34] just not dead to yourself yet.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; You're just not surrendered yet like you
[1:14:38] ought to be.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:46] Make them quit wearing shorts. No
[1:14:49] excuses. Make them quit paddling.
[1:14:51] Brother Brandon tries to cover it all.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Hello. How many know the Holy Ghost will
[1:14:56] make you watch your tongue?
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; You know, I just had a thought today and
[1:15:06] I might as well share it with you since
[1:15:07] it comes to my mind. But tattling and
[1:15:10] gossiping and causing divisions in a
[1:15:12] church, I think that is one of the
[1:15:14] worst, most sinful, deadly, deadly,
[1:15:17] devilish things that we can do.
[1:15:20] It
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; I I I I'm not going to categorize it,
[1:15:23] but if you my own personal opinion, and
[1:15:25] maybe I shouldn't give my opinion, but
[1:15:27] it's probably worse than adultery or
[1:15:28] anything else.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That might be between two people,
[1:15:32] but when somebody comes and does like
[1:15:33] what the devil did up in heaven and took
[1:15:35] twothirds of the angels and divided
[1:15:37] heaven up, God never did forgive him.
[1:15:40] He's going straight to hell. And God
[1:15:42] hates division. God hates people that
[1:15:43] bring division and things.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Hello. It's a terrible thing to do.
[1:15:47] That's why people better watch their
[1:15:49] mouth.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Quit tattling. That's what it's for, to
[1:15:57] make you live a holy life. It'll follow
[1:15:59] the instructions of the Bible every
[1:16:01] time.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Women say it's just too hot. How many
[1:16:05] know it's an excuse? Amen. We sing that
[1:16:08] song, excuses, excuses. You hear them
[1:16:10] every day. Go to church. The preacher's
[1:16:13] just way too quiet or he's way too loud.
[1:16:16] Music's too soft or it's too loud. It's
[1:16:18] too hot or it's too cold.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; I might as well just preach. people quit
[1:16:23] church, go home. And all the other
[1:16:25] excuses was, "And there's too many
[1:16:26] hypocrites in hell in the church. That's
[1:16:29] why I didn't go to church. Somebody hurt
[1:16:32] my feelings."
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "Oh, so you're hiding
[1:16:38] behind a hypocrite. You little hider.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; You little excuse maker."
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, folks. There not going to
[1:16:50] be no excuses. Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Weak.
[1:16:57] Weak.
[1:16:59] Can't have nobody say something about
[1:17:00] you without you throwing a fit.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Without going and praying for him like
[1:17:05] you ought to
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; can't take nothing. Brother Phil, people
[1:17:09] can't take nothing.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; I hope Gillum don't mind. We was
[1:17:16] painting away on his house and he said,
[1:17:17] "Dad," because I was telling him, he
[1:17:19] said, "You got to be patient, Dad." And
[1:17:20] I says I said patience is just not part
[1:17:23] of my DNA, Caleb.
[1:17:28] All my life I've worked hard and fast
[1:17:30] and it's so hard for me to have
[1:17:32] patience. He said, "You just don't have
[1:17:34] patience." I said, "Son," I said, "I
[1:17:36] don't know so much about that. I've went
[1:17:38] through some hard times and I've had to
[1:17:40] have a lot of patience through it. So,
[1:17:42] I've got a little patience."
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; If I could just get it in every area of
[1:17:49] my life now, maybe we'd be all right.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's right.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; So, he goes on, listen. Oh, too hot to
[1:17:59] where it gives me a headache if I let my
[1:18:00] hair grow, but there's no excuses with
[1:18:04] the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's uh it's here to make it
[1:18:10] so. I like that. Don't you? It makes it
[1:18:14] so. It's got hair on its chest. It don't
[1:18:17] tally down. It's Oh, I wish. David
[1:18:20] didn't wish the giant would fall. He
[1:18:22] says, "Where's my sling? Let me add
[1:18:24] him." That's what the Holy Ghost will
[1:18:26] do. Everybody else will cower down. Oh,
[1:18:28] I'm scared. Don't get scared.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:36] It'll follow the word just exactly. How
[1:18:39] many believe that? That's what the Holy
[1:18:41] Ghost is to do. It's to make you man
[1:18:44] turn your head from them half naked
[1:18:47] women and quit lusting after them.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. A church member, it'll do that.
[1:18:51] It's to cause you to quit quit making
[1:18:54] you quit smoke, quit drink, quit wanting
[1:18:57] to be a big shot.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It'll take all of that out of you.
[1:19:02] It'll humble you when you do that.
[1:19:04] That's what the Holy Ghost is for. It's
[1:19:06] for a holy life. Make you quit
[1:19:09] gossiping. make you quit playing cards,
[1:19:11] shooting craps, and all these other
[1:19:13] things that you do around the corner.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; How many knows that if you really got
[1:19:20] the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost convicts
[1:19:22] you of those little things that you do
[1:19:24] wrong?
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Don't think the Holy Ghost don't tell
[1:19:28] you. He does. He does me. I know the
[1:19:30] voice of the Holy Ghost. I know what he
[1:19:32] tells me. Now, you ought to do this and
[1:19:34] ought to do that. You know what it you
[1:19:37] know what it's like some too at times to
[1:19:39] ignore that and your flesh wants to do
[1:19:41] the opposite. Hello. And that's where we
[1:19:43] get in our troubles is we don't listen
[1:19:45] to the Holy Ghost and he gives us all
[1:19:47] kinds of excuses
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; but it's all nothing but an excuse.
[1:19:55] I mean believe the Holy Ghost will tell
[1:19:57] you if you really got the Holy Ghost. I
[1:19:59] thought today I said boy oh boy. I'll
[1:20:01] tell you what what we need. We need We
[1:20:03] need young people that's got the Holy
[1:20:06] Ghost.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; It'll make you love your parents. It'll
[1:20:08] make you obey your parents. It'll make
[1:20:10] you a good teenager.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Parents, you're in for a real treat if
[1:20:16] your children get the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; They'll be sensitive. They'll apologize.
[1:20:20] They won't want to do things wrong.
[1:20:22] Young people, let me tell you something.
[1:20:23] You're a blessed person if your parents
[1:20:25] get the Holy Ghost. If they got the Holy
[1:20:27] Ghost,
[1:20:30] I want to say want to say they won't
[1:20:31] half beat you to death. But brother
[1:20:32] Bland really didn't put it that way.
[1:20:37] [Laughter]
[1:20:39] Take a barrel slap. There was it teenage
[1:20:41] daughter out there doing he wouldn't
[1:20:44] walk for a week or something like that.
[1:20:46] Ain't that right? I can't imagine all
[1:20:48] that. Why? But they got such a love for
[1:20:50] you. It's better to half kill you than
[1:20:53] to have you kill yourself with your
[1:20:56] disobedience and going out into the
[1:20:58] world and getting into drugs getting
[1:21:00] killed.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] Amen. I'll tell it again. We had a big
[1:21:06] old paint stick and we put two big old
[1:21:09] five gallon buckets paint stick. Oh, by
[1:21:11] the way, I've got a bunch of them if you
[1:21:13] parents need any. We got a bunch of
[1:21:15] buckets of that paint and they gave me
[1:21:17] way more sticks than I need. Amen. Tape
[1:21:19] them together. Good. Amen. And write on
[1:21:21] there like we did soul saver.
[1:21:25] Why? Because the Bible said that's a
[1:21:26] soul save his soul.
[1:21:30] The soul saver, right?
[1:21:34] But by God's grace, if you got the Holy
[1:21:36] Ghost, hopefully, you know what, kids,
[1:21:38] let me just give you a little trick on
[1:21:40] how to get out of weapons. How many
[1:21:43] would like to get out of weapons?
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; None of their hands were up. Well,
[1:21:47] parents, you've seen it. No, get the
[1:21:51] Holy Ghost and you won't do things that
[1:21:53] you ought to do.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; They won't have to whip you. Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? That's certainly not
[1:22:02] in my notes, but it's totally free.
[1:22:05] Didn't cost any extra.
[1:22:07] You didn't even have to give me a tip.
[1:22:09] We're all right.
[1:22:11] Amen. You love the Lord.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; So, listen what he says here. That's
[1:22:16] right. Let me see where we're at. Make
[1:22:18] you doing all this stuff. I'm true to
[1:22:20] your wife. Make you want to quit
[1:22:22] marrying somebody else's wife. That's
[1:22:24] right. That's what it is. It's to make
[1:22:26] you live a holy life. That's what the
[1:22:28] Holy Ghost power is for. It's to set
[1:22:30] your affections on things above where
[1:22:33] God stands at the right hand of God.
[1:22:36] Amen. Let this mind be in you. And you
[1:22:40] say, "Well, I just can't do it." Oh, I
[1:22:42] just can't do it. Sure you can. But the
[1:22:45] Holy Ghost come for that purpose. That's
[1:22:49] what it did. It came to take that out of
[1:22:51] you.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe that? Well,
[1:22:57] we get the Holy Ghost. Amen. When we
[1:22:59] come to church,
[1:23:01] Amen. Sometimes, and I was thinking, you
[1:23:02] know, that when we come to church and we
[1:23:04] have a service, it's like pulling a
[1:23:06] wagon.
[1:23:10] Amen. I'm not sure who it was anymore,
[1:23:13] but some preachers uh he they were two
[1:23:16] preachers always went with each other
[1:23:17] and one would scotch for the other. One
[1:23:20] would scotch for the other. Scotching
[1:23:21] means a wagon goes forward and you put a
[1:23:22] little scotch on it, you know. Amen,
[1:23:24] brother. Amen. Amen. Amen. Get him up
[1:23:27] over there. And one time that brother,
[1:23:28] he just didn't Amen. Amen at all. And he
[1:23:30] flowed and he just had a hard time.
[1:23:33] Amen. A and the brother asked him, "Why
[1:23:36] didn't you scotch for me?" Have you
[1:23:38] heard this one?
[1:23:39] Why didn't you scotch for me? He says,
[1:23:41] 'Well, you never move forward.
[1:23:46] You never move forward.
[1:23:50] But let me say this, it's like pushing
[1:23:52] the wagon up and I'm pulling and I'm
[1:23:55] pulling. Amen. And if you get the Holy
[1:23:57] Ghost, you'll help pull, too. Amen. How
[1:24:00] many believe we all got to pull a
[1:24:01] little? Amen. It'll make you say, "Amen.
[1:24:04] Preach it, Brother Bo. Preach it,
[1:24:05] Brother Brad. Let's pull this thing. Cuz
[1:24:10] I'm here to tell you the atmosphere of
[1:24:12] every prayer service that we come to.
[1:24:14] Amen. We sometimes I don't understand
[1:24:16] why it's not the same. Sometimes why it
[1:24:18] seems like you're plowing the whole way,
[1:24:21] pushing the whole way. And how many
[1:24:22] believe it ought to really not be that
[1:24:24] way.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; There should be no hindering spirit
[1:24:26] here.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; There should be nobody sitting with a
[1:24:29] critical attitude. And sometimes them
[1:24:31] things cause the church to fail. It
[1:24:33] causes a pullback.
[1:24:37] And we need to come prayed up. Come 30
[1:24:39] minutes early. Pray at home. Pray
[1:24:41] wherever. But come prepared and saying,
[1:24:43] "God, we're going to pull."
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz we got the preacher to preach
[1:24:47] and let him get out of the way. Amen.
[1:24:49] Get this little wagon up over the hill
[1:24:51] going down the other side. Amen. And
[1:24:53] then everybody hang on cuz we're
[1:24:55] cruising now. Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; How many wants to get up over the other
[1:24:59] side and say, "Oh boy, this is hold, you
[1:25:02] know, hold back almost because we're
[1:25:04] going to pump the roof off here if we
[1:25:06] don't watch it.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; This wagon's going to get away from us."
[1:25:10] But it ought to be easy. How many
[1:25:12] believe we ought to be in heavenly
[1:25:13] places in Christ Jesus?
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; We're gathered in heavenly places, but
[1:25:18] the Holy Ghost comes to take those
[1:25:21] can'ts out of you. Get it away from you.
[1:25:24] Yes, you can do it. Why? because you're
[1:25:27] letting the Holy Spirit
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; do it through you.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; You've surrendered yourself.
[1:25:33] Amen.
[1:25:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:41] I want to talk about why we make
[1:25:43] excuses,
[1:25:44] why we make excuses, and then
[1:25:47] how we can overcome making those
[1:25:49] excuses, not be at the place where we
[1:25:52] make excuses. How's that sound? Sound
[1:25:54] like a lesson for this Wednesday night.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:04] That good Chick-fil-A. Them chicken
[1:26:07] strips are all for good.
[1:26:13] Kelly brought us some home.
[1:26:17] How many likes them? Pretty good.
[1:26:23] make you drink water. But anyway, that's
[1:26:25] all right. So now notice he says, "You
[1:26:28] say you just can't do it." Sure, you
[1:26:30] can't. But the Holy Ghost come for that
[1:26:34] p purpose. Amen. So that you don't just
[1:26:37] have excuses, but so that you could do
[1:26:39] it.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? No excuses.
[1:26:45] That's what it did. It come to take it
[1:26:47] all that all that out of you. all of
[1:26:49] them old habits and things that you're
[1:26:51] doing. Amen. That old backbiting,
[1:26:54] separating self saying, "Bless God, I'm
[1:26:56] a Methodist." This that or the other, I
[1:26:58] won't have nothing to do with this one
[1:27:00] or that one. Come on, folks. He said,
[1:27:01] "As long as we have the Holy Ghost, we
[1:27:03] should be a unified group." How many
[1:27:06] believe that?
[1:27:08] It's to give uncction to a preacher.
[1:27:09] It's to give holiness to a group. It's
[1:27:11] to set the church in order. It's to
[1:27:13] bring unity of spirit to unite us
[1:27:16] together with power. It's get unite us
[1:27:19] together with love, brotherly love.
[1:27:22] Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, now look, this is
[1:27:27] what is the Holy Ghost for given for
[1:27:29] towards the end of this. Now, people
[1:27:31] look at me in the face. A lot of hands
[1:27:34] went up that you had the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:36] Amen. Now, I'm I'm just going to bounce
[1:27:39] for just a little bit. He said another
[1:27:42] place he said he's been kind of holding
[1:27:43] it back. Kind of holding it back. Trying
[1:27:45] not to be too hard on the people. Amen.
[1:27:48] But he just wants to let it go. He want
[1:27:50] He really wanted to let it go. Now, I'm
[1:27:52] just going to bounce here just a little
[1:27:53] bit here. This is taped, but we're going
[1:27:56] to get more of it tomorrow night. He
[1:27:58] says, "If you say that you're guilty of
[1:28:00] these things, I wonder what's leading
[1:28:02] you." God will never lead you away from
[1:28:06] the word. He'll keep you with the word.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you say, "It don't harm me
[1:28:12] to do this and that." It doesn't. If the
[1:28:15] word says it, if the Holy Spirit is in
[1:28:17] you, it'll lead you to the right way, to
[1:28:20] the right word. And there will be no
[1:28:24] excuses.
[1:28:26] No excuses.
[1:28:31] Amen. God don't make alterations
[1:28:35] or excuses. He makes the mark and you
[1:28:38] tow it. That's all. That's what it is
[1:28:41] with everyone. You come the same way.
[1:28:45] Amen. Now, I don't mean to hurt you. I
[1:28:47] love you too much. But brother, sister,
[1:28:50] do you realize that I've got to stand in
[1:28:52] the last day at the resurrection with
[1:28:54] this generation of people and give an
[1:28:56] account for this word? The Holy Spirit
[1:28:59] showing this and me preaching out
[1:29:01] yonder, where are you going to stand?
[1:29:04] How are you going to get by with it? You
[1:29:06] can't do it, friend. So now stop that.
[1:29:09] Whatever you're doing wrong, stop it.
[1:29:12] How many believe that goes for me, that
[1:29:14] goes for every one of us. Whatever
[1:29:16] you're doing that you know you shouldn't
[1:29:19] do, stop it.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Repent.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Now, if I was a prophet of God, the
[1:29:29] angel of the Lord come down here, I
[1:29:31] could go down through here and I tell
[1:29:32] you where every one of your faults,
[1:29:34] where every one of your failures is.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Sure, he could could discern, but I am
[1:29:40] not. But you know what? How many is with
[1:29:43] me tonight? If you'll listen real close,
[1:29:45] the Holy Spirit will talk to you.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope none of you is doing
[1:29:51] anything wrong anywhere.
[1:29:55] Huh?
[1:29:57] I really hope so.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; But most of us will probably have to
[1:30:00] say, "He's not finished with me yet."
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:08] I'm just going to take it as from the
[1:30:10] Lord bringing it back to my mind here
[1:30:12] because I started with the children. But
[1:30:13] how many knows we need parents that are
[1:30:15] Holy Ghost fil?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; We need marriages. We need families and
[1:30:19] our marriages, husbands and wives and
[1:30:22] that love each other,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; that get along with each other.
[1:30:27] Amen. Me and my wife, we've been getting
[1:30:29] together a long time. And I'm still
[1:30:31] learning how to treat her. I'm still
[1:30:35] learning how to be a a better husband.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And I didn't say it, but you let your
[1:30:42] husband get the Holy Ghost
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; and you're in for a treat, honey. Well,
[1:30:46] I shouldn't call you honey. I only got
[1:30:47] one, honey.
[1:30:50] [Laughter]
[1:30:55] Wife, you are in for a good time.
[1:30:59] That's right. In the same way, if the
[1:31:02] wife gets a Holy Ghost, husbands, you're
[1:31:05] in for a treat because why? That
[1:31:07] Christianity is going to reflect right
[1:31:10] there. How many believes that shows it?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:15] We need strong relationships of husbands
[1:31:17] and wives, children.
[1:31:21] Amen. Brothers and sisters,
[1:31:24] that's what the Holy Ghost came for. to
[1:31:27] bring unity, to bring love, strong
[1:31:30] marriages.
[1:31:31] It'll make a husband treat his wife
[1:31:33] right, understanding, loving.
[1:31:40] Should I just say what comes to my mind?
[1:31:44] And remember, husband, you're the head.
[1:31:49] You're the leader in all this. Don't
[1:31:53] expect her to do the leading. I don't
[1:31:56] care if she yells at you, screams at
[1:31:58] you, tries to smack you, and you got to
[1:32:00] dodge. You're going to have to learn how
[1:32:03] to tame all that.
[1:32:08] You're going to have to learn to get her
[1:32:10] to where she don't act like that. Where
[1:32:13] she don't have to act like that, because
[1:32:15] her chances are probably pretty high
[1:32:18] you cause it in the first place.
[1:32:26] I said that a little quietly to save us
[1:32:28] fellas. But you heard me. I guess
[1:32:34] how many believes that's what I what I
[1:32:36] have told you is the truth. That
[1:32:38] husbands and wives, let them get the
[1:32:39] Holy Ghost the way they're supposed to
[1:32:40] have it. And you're going to act the way
[1:32:42] the Holy Spirit is going to act.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; You're going to have his reactions.
[1:32:46] You're going to have his thoughts.
[1:32:47] You're going to have his kindness.
[1:32:48] You're going to have his patience,
[1:32:50] patience, and longsuffering. You're
[1:32:52] going to have his gentleness.
[1:32:54] I don't care if you're a mountain man
[1:32:56] burly and and
[1:32:59] mountain men are mean and mountain men
[1:33:02] are rough and mountain men are low down
[1:33:04] but let them get the Holy Ghost one time
[1:33:06] and they'll become unmean gentle and
[1:33:09] meek and kind. Isn't that right?
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's what the Holy Ghost
[1:33:14] is for. Don't give no excuses.
[1:33:21] Amen.
[1:33:23] We shouldn't have to. And I I certainly
[1:33:26] don't believe in just preaching and just
[1:33:30] telling you the stories of baseball
[1:33:32] games and people pulling hats down how
[1:33:34] they worship just to get you excited
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; and just to make you worship. But I'm
[1:33:39] here to tell you when the word comes
[1:33:40] forth that's worth worshiping about, I
[1:33:43] mean, I believe we ought to give God a
[1:33:45] little worship.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe we ought to have the
[1:33:48] preachers ought to have to pull the
[1:33:50] worship out of you.
[1:33:52] No, it ought to be there already, y'all.
[1:33:54] They come automatically.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. People, the song leaders, they
[1:33:58] shouldn't have to come. Come on now,
[1:34:00] y'all. Help me out here. I can't barely
[1:34:02] hear anybody. Nobody think shouldn't
[1:34:03] have to do that. No, we should come with
[1:34:05] a heart full of joy.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; We ought to be tuned up. We ought to
[1:34:08] have our lamps trimmed.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The foolish virgin merchants,
[1:34:12] they're going to have an excuse. Well,
[1:34:14] our oil ran out. Huh? That's going to be
[1:34:18] their excuse. Why did you let your oil
[1:34:20] run out?
[1:34:22] Well, I'll tell you why. I can tell you
[1:34:24] why. Because they let the things of the
[1:34:26] world take over. Amen. And it choked out
[1:34:28] the light that was in them and people
[1:34:30] drift off.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] All right. Where are we?
[1:34:40] So he says, "I just can't." That's
[1:34:43] right.
[1:34:44] the old habits, backbiting and so forth,
[1:34:47] separating yourself. I already had that
[1:34:49] one.
[1:34:55] Okay,
[1:34:58] one more page before we get to the last
[1:34:59] one. We're running pretty good on
[1:35:01] schedule.
[1:35:03] All right.
[1:35:10] So,
[1:35:12] I'll stand before that generation and
[1:35:14] give an account out yonder. Where are
[1:35:15] you going to stand? So, whatever you're
[1:35:17] doing, stop it. Say you can't. You say
[1:35:19] you can't. Then you haven't got the
[1:35:22] caner in you or the caner. Amen. How
[1:35:26] many please? We got to have that one
[1:35:28] that can do it.
[1:35:32] Oh, how many know that's not me? That's
[1:35:35] not the flesh. That's the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:38] That's not you, but that's the Holy
[1:35:40] Ghost. How many say I the Holy Ghost can
[1:35:43] do it?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; He's He's the caner.
[1:35:48] Amen. When the Holy Ghost comes, he
[1:35:50] gives you power over the world.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen. He says if you love the
[1:35:56] world or things of the world, it's
[1:35:58] because the love of God isn't in you.
[1:36:01] Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just want to pray for Carson here
[1:36:07] at the end of the service, but if we
[1:36:08] want to say to him just before we go,
[1:36:11] Amen. It's quite a world out there. I
[1:36:13] don't know just how it is. You're going
[1:36:15] to find out how it is. But there's one
[1:36:17] thing that's going to cause you to be
[1:36:19] able to overcome that. And to be an
[1:36:21] overcomer, it's going to be the faith
[1:36:23] that you have in Jesus Christ. Because
[1:36:26] this is the victory that overcomes the
[1:36:28] world, even your faith. Amen. People
[1:36:33] will question it and make you doubt it
[1:36:34] and everything else, but if you are
[1:36:36] grounded in that faith, you'll overcome
[1:36:39] the world. Praise the Lord. So, why is
[1:36:43] it sometimes that we have excuses or
[1:36:46] make excuses? It's because of this.
[1:36:49] Amen. A lot of times it's because of our
[1:36:52] lack of prayer.
[1:36:55] Hello. Our lack of closeness to God.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I like this quote to better explain
[1:37:01] it. Brother Bandon was talking about he
[1:37:04] says, "Can you imagine talking about
[1:37:06] exhausting God's love?"
[1:37:10] Well,
[1:37:11] okay.
[1:37:13] Exhausting God's love and power and
[1:37:16] beneficiaries for you. Can you imagine a
[1:37:18] little bitty fish about that long way
[1:37:20] out there in the middle of the ocean
[1:37:21] saying, "Now, wait a minute. I better
[1:37:23] consider this thing. I better drink of
[1:37:25] this water sparingly.
[1:37:28] I mean, no. He said, we've got we've got
[1:37:30] an ocean.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; We've got an ocean. We've got all 1100
[1:37:35] tape. We got the book. We've got the
[1:37:37] vindication. We've got all the water
[1:37:39] that you need.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to worry about drinking
[1:37:44] sparingly.
[1:37:45] But one of the problems is why we come
[1:37:47] with excuses is because amen the the
[1:37:50] cares of life choke out our time to
[1:37:53] pray. We ain't got time to pray. We
[1:37:55] ain't got time to read.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; We ain't got time to listen to a
[1:37:58] preacher brother Brandon everything. And
[1:38:00] that hurts us.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; You're drinking too sparingly. You're a
[1:38:05] little fish in the ocean getting skinny
[1:38:08] cuz you're not eating the way you should
[1:38:10] and drinking the way that you should.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:16] He says, "Well, that could easily be
[1:38:18] done more easier than you could ever ask
[1:38:20] too much of God." How many knows? He
[1:38:22] says, "The Bible says you ask not
[1:38:24] because you believe not. You receive not
[1:38:26] because you ask not." So, how many
[1:38:28] believes you got to ask? You got to
[1:38:30] believe.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever we have need of, ask him
[1:38:34] and believe it. He provided in every
[1:38:36] redemptive blessing that he died for at
[1:38:38] Calvary. and he gave a promise to you
[1:38:40] for everything that you have need of
[1:38:42] while on life's journey. It's yours if
[1:38:45] you'll believe. Or could you imagine the
[1:38:48] little mouse about that long in the
[1:38:49] gardeners of Egypt way down there at the
[1:38:52] bottom mine at the very bottom and
[1:38:54] saying, "Look, I better take my little
[1:38:55] bag and I'm going to go over here and
[1:38:57] store it over here in my house because I
[1:38:59] might run out." You don't have to worry
[1:39:01] about running out. It's probably I don't
[1:39:03] know how long mice live, seven years,
[1:39:05] five years. Amen. But you got enough to
[1:39:07] last you a lifetime. Amen. You can eat
[1:39:10] until you look like roly pololy
[1:39:13] and you can stay fat and sassy.
[1:39:16] How many believe I'll tell you what you
[1:39:18] can drink and drink. We've got waters to
[1:39:21] drink.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; And I thought, man, what we need is
[1:39:24] Christians with a spiritual drinking
[1:39:27] problem.
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Folks, we're so caught up with the cares
[1:39:32] of life, we don't drink enough.
[1:39:35] People have drinking problems. They
[1:39:36] drink all the time. Can't help
[1:39:38] themselves. Walking around drunk.
[1:39:40] Alcoholics.
[1:39:42] Well, we need spiritual alcoholics.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Just drinking all the time.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; How y'all doing? Just get a little
[1:39:53] spiritually drunk once in a while.
[1:39:55] Hello.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Get so full of the Holy Ghost till you
[1:39:59] stagger like drunk people.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; We ain't done that in a while, have we?
[1:40:09] That's right. Lord, help me.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I want to do it. I want to drink more of
[1:40:15] it.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe we drink sparingly.
[1:40:20] We get come to church and I'll tell you
[1:40:22] what, it's so dry.
[1:40:26] We got to go somewhere else to some
[1:40:28] church that's lively.
[1:40:30] Huh?
[1:40:32] Excuses.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Excuses.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to drink more. I got to drink
[1:40:40] more. Brother Brad, we got to drink
[1:40:41] more.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Like the Bible
[1:40:49] says, I've repeated it many times. Amen.
[1:40:52] Let your soul delight itself in fatness.
[1:40:55] Come drink, buy wine, and all. That's
[1:40:58] right. Without money, without price.
[1:41:01] We ought to be happy about that. You
[1:41:04] don't have to do anything about it. You
[1:41:05] ain't You You didn't have to pay the
[1:41:07] price at Calvary. You didn't have to let
[1:41:09] them beat you to death, drag you up on a
[1:41:11] stick, and put snails in your hand,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; crucify you. No, he did it for you. He
[1:41:17] paid for all of it. It ought to make us
[1:41:19] happy to know it's without money. It's
[1:41:21] without price. It's free.
[1:41:24] If you don't drink, if you don't eat,
[1:41:28] don't blame him.
[1:41:32] Amen.
[1:41:35] Well, that church is too dry.
[1:41:38] You know what that is? That's a
[1:41:40] complaint.
[1:41:42] That's whining.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; That's spiritual
[1:41:47] starvation.
[1:41:49] Cuz you if you wouldn't do that, you
[1:41:50] wouldn't worry about everybody else.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; You'd make sure that you're in the
[1:41:55] spirit the way you ought to be in the
[1:41:56] spirit.
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:41:59] Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:42:05] Couple of things we want to talk about.
[1:42:06] The reason why and then how to get over
[1:42:08] it. Is that okay?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; I just thought of these quotes. I said,
[1:42:12] you know, this is part of the reasons
[1:42:14] why we a lot of times we get to complain
[1:42:16] and murmur. Brother, many illustrations
[1:42:18] talked about a a cactus or those plants
[1:42:21] out in the west. I don't know much about
[1:42:22] it. I just take his word for it. But he
[1:42:24] says it's so dry until their leaves coil
[1:42:28] up and they become stickers.
[1:42:31] Is that right? And if you touch against
[1:42:33] them, ow ow ow. It's the way some people
[1:42:37] are get around them and they're
[1:42:38] complaining about this and that and the
[1:42:40] other and you go away feeling like that
[1:42:42] was sticky.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Boy, that wasn't very comfortable at
[1:42:45] all.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because somebody's so
[1:42:48] spiritually dry. All they can do is sit
[1:42:51] around the table and talk about
[1:42:52] somebody. Talk bad about somebody.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; You spiritual deprived demon.
[1:42:58] Hello.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; That's nothing but a complaining devil.
[1:43:02] But you get water,
[1:43:05] those sneakers unroll and they become
[1:43:08] beautiful leaves. Ain't that right? They
[1:43:11] become soft, not sticky.
[1:43:14] Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Brother, did you know somebody said this
[1:43:18] about you? Ah, they didn't mean it. Soft
[1:43:22] and gentle and flexible.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; But if you still sinky, somebody said
[1:43:27] that. Oh, I'll get them. Where?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, folks.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:38] Excuses.
[1:43:40] Remember,
[1:43:42] there's no excuse. There's no excuse why
[1:43:46] we shouldn't possess the things that we
[1:43:48] desire.
[1:43:51] There is no excuse
[1:43:53] to not possess the things that we
[1:43:55] desired. They're bought and paid for.
[1:43:57] It's waiting on the table for you. Get
[1:43:59] your fork and dig in.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Come and dine. Ain't that right? He
[1:44:06] called them. Come on. Come on. Dinner's
[1:44:08] ready. Everything's ready. All you got
[1:44:11] to do is come. But they made excuse.
[1:44:15] How how many knows that we human beings,
[1:44:18] we sure are full of excuses. We make our
[1:44:20] excuses if we aren't careful.
[1:44:25] All right.
[1:44:32] Brother Bam says,
[1:44:34] "You all are great fruit raisers out
[1:44:37] here in California. You raise oranges.
[1:44:40] Did you know that when that little
[1:44:42] orange tree is just about a half an inch
[1:44:46] high,
[1:44:48] that every bushel of oranges that you'll
[1:44:50] ever pick off of it is in that tree
[1:44:53] right then? Amen. It's in that tree. Did
[1:44:57] you know that? Didn't brother Bab says
[1:44:59] when you get the Holy Ghost, it's maybe
[1:45:01] about the size of your fingernail or
[1:45:02] thumbnail one
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; and it goes into your heart and it just
[1:45:07] grows from there.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] Folks, I'm here to tell you something. I
[1:45:15] believe that these quotes are very
[1:45:18] powerful.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; They're timeless. They don't get old to
[1:45:22] me.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; I believe they're keys for us to become
[1:45:25] the kind of Christians that we're
[1:45:26] supposed to be.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] That's right. Half an inch.
[1:45:33] All you got to do and listen
[1:45:36] and all that you got to do with that
[1:45:38] little tree is just plant it
[1:45:41] and then you have to give it water and
[1:45:43] it just drinks and more than its
[1:45:45] allotted portion. More it drinks the
[1:45:47] more it pushes out.
[1:45:53] I'll just say what comes to mind. You
[1:45:56] know, brother Bram said that you didn't
[1:45:58] have to go to church
[1:46:01] to be saved. Going to church doesn't
[1:46:03] save you.
[1:46:05] Can have somebody else tell me what the
[1:46:07] other half of that is?
[1:46:12] The other half of that he says church
[1:46:14] keeps you saved.
[1:46:16] Church keeps you saved. Why? Because
[1:46:20] I it would just be great that we got
[1:46:22] saved. We're in our fullness. We never
[1:46:25] have our downs. We never have no we're
[1:46:28] perfect. It's perfect. No, it's that's
[1:46:30] not how it is. a Christian life, you've
[1:46:33] got to water it. You've got to feed it.
[1:46:36] Brother B says, you've got to milk the
[1:46:38] cow or she'll go dry. You've got to
[1:46:40] share. You've got to feed on the word or
[1:46:42] you will die. You come to church to stay
[1:46:45] alive. Sure, you can get saved in
[1:46:47] church. Sure, but that's not what saves
[1:46:50] you. Church itself doesn't save you.
[1:46:52] Christ does.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; But coming to church is important
[1:46:55] because uh but because the Holy Ghost
[1:46:57] will feed you.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You come to drink and drink and
[1:47:02] push out. Now, how many knows that you
[1:47:05] shouldn't just drink here when you're at
[1:47:08] home, when you're driving down the road?
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you experience this or
[1:47:12] not, but when you're driving the road
[1:47:13] thinking about the Lord, Amen. You'll
[1:47:15] his presence will come in there so
[1:47:17] strong until you begin to think and and
[1:47:19] and weeping almost because of the
[1:47:21] presence of the Lord. Presence of the
[1:47:23] Lord isn't just for in church. It's for
[1:47:25] everywhere you are. If you really want
[1:47:27] it,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; just keep drinking.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; So that when you come those doors,
[1:47:33] you're already fed up.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; We could go preach for a long time
[1:47:39] talking about the Christian. Amen.
[1:47:40] Living in that kind of glory is always
[1:47:43] fed up. Lord help me. I want to stay fed
[1:47:46] up
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; because it's so easy to get distracted
[1:47:49] because of the cares of this world.
[1:47:54] Okay, we're going to just jump a little
[1:47:55] bit. Whenever a believer is placed in
[1:47:58] Jesus Christ, you're planted in there in
[1:48:00] the inexhaustible fountain of life. And
[1:48:02] the more you drink, the more you push
[1:48:04] out. That's right. Oh, I you might say,
[1:48:06] I believe that Jesus saves me. That's
[1:48:08] good. Then how about the Holy Ghost? How
[1:48:10] about getting filled with the Holy
[1:48:11] Ghost? You believe the Holy Ghost will
[1:48:13] fill you? He promised you. Every divine,
[1:48:15] even divine healing, he promised it to
[1:48:17] you. Every redemptive blessing belongs
[1:48:20] to you. All you got to do is drink. How
[1:48:23] many believe that you've got that on the
[1:48:24] inside? You already have. Let me just
[1:48:28] say it the way the prophet is. When you
[1:48:29] receive the Holy Ghost, everything that
[1:48:31] you've got need of between here and
[1:48:33] glory is in you right then.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; It ain't faith you need. You got faith
[1:48:39] if you got the Holy Ghost. He is your
[1:48:42] faith. But the thing of know is how to
[1:48:44] use that faith. If you understand how to
[1:48:46] use it. Amen. How many believe that? How
[1:48:50] to use it.
[1:48:54] All right,
[1:48:56] we're already a little past time.
[1:49:03] Okay,
[1:49:09] seems like I missed something
[1:49:16] now.
[1:49:20] How can we not be excuse makers
[1:49:26] or not be what we might call halfway?
[1:49:31] Halfway there. Half done. Not quite
[1:49:33] done. Half done.
[1:49:37] Amen.
[1:49:39] How can we really come to that place?
[1:49:42] I'm just going to read it to you. See,
[1:49:53] because I don't know about you, but I
[1:49:55] still see things in my life that God has
[1:49:57] to work on.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; How about you?
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; I mean, if you don't, I want to shake
[1:50:06] your hand.
[1:50:08] You know,
[1:50:11] after church, come up, say, "Brother,
[1:50:13] [Laughter]
[1:50:15] now when you shake my hand,
[1:50:17] you're going to be saying, "No, brother,
[1:50:19] I'm not perfect." But Amen. All right,
[1:50:22] I'll leave that alone. Just like you
[1:50:23] listen, Brother Bam says, "Make uh he
[1:50:25] says God makes complete Christians. God
[1:50:28] don't make halfway preachers, but
[1:50:30] sometimes a preacher can be halfway."
[1:50:34] God makes his children Christian, I mean
[1:50:36] Christians, but sometimes they're
[1:50:38] halfway Christians, but it's not God's
[1:50:41] intention for them to be that way. Now,
[1:50:44] what I wanted to bring about this is why
[1:50:46] sometimes that we are not what we're
[1:50:48] supposed to be. The bottom line is
[1:50:51] something I've said many times, but
[1:50:53] maybe somebody here hasn't heard it
[1:50:54] before. Listen, it's not God's intention
[1:50:58] for them to be that way. It's their own
[1:51:00] ways that got mixed up in the plan of
[1:51:03] God in their life. How many believe that
[1:51:05] we are not there yet? Because sometimes
[1:51:08] there's still some of our self in there.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; We allow our flesh, our feelings, our
[1:51:15] emotions to make excuses.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:26] to make excuses because there's a
[1:51:28] mixture there that what makes them that
[1:51:30] way.
[1:51:33] Then he says it this way and this is to
[1:51:35] tell you
[1:51:38] let you know how that we can and desire
[1:51:41] to in our hearts to become
[1:51:46] to the place where God wants us to be.
[1:51:52] He says, "And a member of that church,
[1:51:55] if he's called to be a member of this
[1:51:57] certain group, then if he would not
[1:51:59] compromise, if the church believes that
[1:52:01] he should not gamble,
[1:52:03] then that member should never touch a
[1:52:05] deck of cards. We don't believe in
[1:52:06] drinking, he should turn his head
[1:52:08] completely from drinking. If we do not
[1:52:10] believe in gambling or smoking, the
[1:52:12] member of this church should never touch
[1:52:13] a thing like that." God gives complete
[1:52:16] deliverance. How many believe that? and
[1:52:19] he will do it if we'll completely
[1:52:24] surrender our life.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; That's the key. That's the key.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; I I I could name names of people that I
[1:52:38] see in here that are more surrendered
[1:52:40] that they were a year ago.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; You can tell by their action. They're
[1:52:44] more surrendered.
[1:52:46] We're still doing things contrary to the
[1:52:48] word of God. That area is still not
[1:52:50] surrendered.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; And that's where our problems is. Lord,
[1:52:54] help us. Amen.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; But Abraham gives us a secret. If we
[1:52:57] will completely surrender ourselves to
[1:52:59] him, then if we will completely deliver
[1:53:03] ourselves into his hands, then God can
[1:53:06] live in us. Christ the hope of glory. He
[1:53:09] can reflect himself from us as we get
[1:53:12] ourselves out of the way. Then our
[1:53:14] thoughts become his thoughts. Amen. Can
[1:53:17] you imagine Christ smoking a cigar,
[1:53:20] sitting down having a whiskey, as I put
[1:53:22] it, and playing some doing some
[1:53:25] gambling.
[1:53:26] Amen. Christ playing cards and so forth.
[1:53:29] Then if your spirit is part of his
[1:53:31] spirit, he wants it to be upon your
[1:53:33] profession. But you permit the devil to
[1:53:36] come in and take over. And all the time
[1:53:38] in your heart, way down deep, you know
[1:53:40] that you're doing those things that are
[1:53:41] wrong. Now, I'm just going to read this.
[1:53:44] I don't think anybody here is doing any
[1:53:45] of this, but I'm going to read it
[1:53:46] against anyway, just in case. And when
[1:53:49] one member would talk against another
[1:53:51] member, you know that's wrong. You're
[1:53:52] commanded to pray for one another. Not
[1:53:54] talk against each other, but to love one
[1:53:56] another. And if someone is down, let's
[1:53:58] pick him up, help him. Amen. That's what
[1:54:00] makes us a unified group together. I
[1:54:03] mean, how many knows even brother Bam
[1:54:04] had to fight the thing? Amen.
[1:54:07] So, my punchline is right there.
[1:54:12] If we can completely ourselves surrender
[1:54:15] ourselves.
[1:54:17] So those listening,
[1:54:20] those here present, myself,
[1:54:23] if you want to be a complete Christian,
[1:54:26] then ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to
[1:54:28] you what areas of your life is not
[1:54:32] surrendered yet.
[1:54:35] Amen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; If it's not surrendered,
[1:54:41] And I want to ask you this.
[1:54:44] All those that feel like there's still
[1:54:46] areas of your life that you need to
[1:54:48] surrender
[1:54:50] and you say, "Lord, I want I want to
[1:54:52] show I want you to show me every bad
[1:54:53] place in my life." Amen. I thank God for
[1:54:57] the places he shows me where I'm wrong
[1:54:59] and where I'm bad. Amen. Where I'm off.
[1:55:01] Amen.
[1:55:05] And you do the same.
[1:55:09] and you want to surrender your life to
[1:55:10] God just now, stand up. Say, "Lord, I
[1:55:13] want to completely surrender to you.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to completely surrender to
[1:55:18] you." Raise your hands in surrenderance
[1:55:21] because raising your hands is a sign,
[1:55:23] universal sign of surrender. Lord Jesus,
[1:55:27] we come before you tonight, Lord. And
[1:55:30] Father, we don't ever want to try to
[1:55:32] make excuses for our bad places, for our
[1:55:35] wrong. We want you to come, Lord, to
[1:55:37] cleanse us from all evil, from all
[1:55:39] unrighteousness. Lord, we want to see
[1:55:42] your reflection in our lives. Lord, we
[1:55:44] ask, Lord Jesus, that we wouldn't allow
[1:55:47] the devil to talk to our hearts, to our
[1:55:49] minds, and try to give an excuse for us
[1:55:52] to do things that's contrary to what
[1:55:54] you've said. Lord, your prophet has
[1:55:56] come. He's given us a ministry that is
[1:55:59] going to perfect the bride, that he's
[1:56:01] going to have a church ready for the
[1:56:02] rapture. And I believe there's this
[1:56:04] group right here, Father, is part of
[1:56:06] that. Lord, we ask God that you would
[1:56:09] take every hand now that's up. And Lord,
[1:56:12] discern the thoughts and the intents of
[1:56:14] the heart right now. You know what
[1:56:17] they're thinking.
[1:56:19] You know what they're confessing.
[1:56:22] You know what they're saying. I
[1:56:23] surrender this to you, Lord. I surrender
[1:56:25] that. Whatever it is, Father, I pray
[1:56:28] Lord that tomorrow morning when they
[1:56:31] wake up, they'll wake up and they will
[1:56:34] not be the same as what they were when
[1:56:36] they woke up this morning. They'll have
[1:56:38] changed because they have more fully
[1:56:40] surrendered to you, Lord. And father,
[1:56:43] help them Lord to have greater joy,
[1:56:46] greater peace, more of your Holy Spirit
[1:56:49] to talk to them in a louder, planer
[1:56:51] voice to do things that you want them to
[1:56:54] do. Go places that you want them to go.
[1:56:57] Encourage people that you want them to
[1:56:59] encourage. Help people that you want
[1:57:01] them to help to for all of us, Lord, to
[1:57:04] help us to do the right thing in every
[1:57:05] aspect of our life. Forgive us of where
[1:57:08] we fail, Lord Jesus. For we certainly
[1:57:10] are failures, Lord. But we know that if
[1:57:13] we have your Holy Spirit, it's got the
[1:57:14] power for us to overcome all un
[1:57:17] unrighteousness and unbelief. Take these
[1:57:20] hands, take these hearts beneath these
[1:57:22] hands now, Lord, and receive them and
[1:57:26] fill them with a greater portion of you.
[1:57:29] Fill them with a greater portion of the
[1:57:31] Holy Ghost, Father, so that we could be
[1:57:34] led by the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:37] in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. God bless
[1:57:42] you. Brother

[1:58:47] Heavenly Father, we come before you
[1:58:48] tonight, Lord. Lord, in this young man
[1:58:51] whom we've watched, Lord, grow up,
[1:58:53] Father, go through high school, Lord
[1:58:55] Jesus. And Lord, and all the things,
[1:58:58] Lord, that he's went through, but Lord,
[1:58:59] now he gone off to college to get a
[1:59:02] degree. And I'm not just sure what it
[1:59:03] is, Lord. But I pray that you would
[1:59:05] bless him in his efforts, Lord, and in
[1:59:08] his endeavor, Lord Jesus. We ask, God,
[1:59:10] that he'd always put you first, Lord
[1:59:12] Jesus. That you'd be first in his life,
[1:59:15] Father, in his prayer life, Lord, in his
[1:59:17] reading of the Bible, Lord Jesus.
[1:59:20] listening to your prophet. We ask God
[1:59:22] that his life would reflect Jesus
[1:59:24] Christ, Lord, to those other people that
[1:59:26] are out there, Lord. Maybe get some
[1:59:28] saved. That would be wonderful, Lord
[1:59:30] Jesus. Lead some to Christ, Father. And
[1:59:32] I pray, God, for your protection against
[1:59:34] the enemy that would cry to come in
[1:59:36] perhaps, perhaps try to make him
[1:59:38] question his faith. But Lord, help him
[1:59:41] to be unwavering, steadfast, sound in
[1:59:43] the gospel, Lord Jesus. And give him,
[1:59:46] Lord Jesus, the love of God in his heart
[1:59:48] to shed abroad that others would see the
[1:59:50] reflection of Christ in him. We ask for
[1:59:52] your safety and for your blessing upon
[1:59:54] him now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:59:57] Amen and amen. God bless you. God bless
[2:00:00] you.
