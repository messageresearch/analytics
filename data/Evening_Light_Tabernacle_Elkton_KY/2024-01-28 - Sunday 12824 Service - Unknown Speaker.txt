TRANSCRIPT
========================================
judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his Reigns [Music] and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea and it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathos and from Kash and from Alam and from shenar and from HTH and from the islands of the sea the Envy also of Ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of Jud shall be cut off Ephraim shall not envy Judah and Judah shall not Vex Ephraim and the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea and with his Mighty Wind shall he shake the hand over the river and shall Smite it in the seven streams and make men go over dryad now 16 together and there shall be an Highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria like as it was was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt amen that's uh brother brother how y'all doing today I'm pretty good A little nervous what y'all come to do what y'all come to do come on you know this is like a this is like the pepper alley a PE a a a pre-meal appetizer you know I was thinking about it you know I I was just thinking about how we can get all fired up together and create that atmosphere where the Lord just feels welcome when Brother Brad comes but you know I hope you brought your little lick of fire that we can just pull on the gift of God you know you know my little thought this morning on my Bible study was uh God gave us his very best and what the prophet teach us he taught us God gave us his very best gave us his word so I got to think about he giving himself he he himself he is the word so when we stop and think about that can you just think about the king of king the king of glory coming down here to us to be one of us the one who created all of us and then to be able to call us and be calling us out into the bride the message of the hour the hour of special hand selected people that will fulfill Malachi the restoration of the church and the power of Christ the word we see Christ in us the hope of glory the manifestation of Jesus Christ in our lives is the more it becomes more real to me is is just mindblowing to me to see that that we start seeing God coming off the off the cross out of the manger out of the paper in a living reality in us you know and it's just so powerful when we start seeing that you know and and it's such a a privilege and honor to be the bride of Christ we are the alpha and omega joint HS bone of bone in fellowship with Christ so I got to thinking last night and I looked up that word in the Greek Lexicon and said I can't pronounce this word con or whatever is translated form in the Greek word which translates concept the concepts such as Fellowship joint participation partnership there to share one has anything a gift jointly contributed Fellowship Association uh Community communion joint joint participation with Christ he said the works I do you shall do also I'm the vine you are the branches you can do nothing except you abide in me you see there you see that's Christ in US the we're written Epistles read of all men we're going to be the billboard for Christ because it's Christ Living Through us it's a living uh manifestation of God's word that's him himself that's what that's what I want to paint that picture of seeing God himself Elohim the all existing one that came down from the glory to be in us to be in Fellowship to be partnership with him because that's what he longed for before the foundation of the world it just got me so fired up thinking about it knowing this knowing Christ the word as Miss Jesus Christ of fellowship with him them is much deeper the world than the world has thanks the Mysteries that we're hidden from the from the foundation of the world we have now through a prophet that he sent us and he's opened our eyes of understanding and helped us see it such a buzzing hallelujah praise God gets me fired up thanking about I I don't know Bo ver contain myself up here I was just thinking about it on the way here I was just so fired up it just gets me but think about this the king of kings that mighty king when you just stop and think about it he said let there be light every little molecule and every ingredient whatever it was that came and made the sight the sun whatever it was all them ingredients obeyed the word of God you know when he said he spoke and something happened something happened I loved how Brad brought that out about Adam and when he breathed life into him he said he went in the action something happens when the Holy Ghost comes on you put you in action you can't help it but go blessed be the name of the Lord Joshua 1 and I said Lord help us fulfill your Commandments in our life we all have a we all have our own book of Acts that we got to write we have our own individual relationship that we must live out through Christ in us you know Joshua 1:9 says have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that are to put a trust and a faith in us in Jesus Christ he's with us he's even in us to the end of the world but you throw up the first slide here instead of ever having everybody turn to the scripture I just had dmy throw them on some slides for us you know John 10 here says I am the Good Shepherd I know my sheep and and am known of mine and the father knoweth me even so know I the father I laid down my life for the sheep and other sheep have I which are not of this fold them also must I bring they shall hear my voice and they shall be of one fold and one Shepherd therefore doeth my father love me because I Lay My Life down and that I may take it up again no man taketh it from me me but I'll lay it down myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again so this is a Commandment that I have received of my father see Jesus Christ right there being obedient to the Commandment that God gave him so blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Lord Jesus that you came down and to to live to die to go that you may come back and live through US blessed be the name of the Lord go ahead and go the next slide he says right here God brother bam said and why he said God gave us the very best at the beginning for his great Mighty Army he has never had to change it because as I said last night his first decision is the best and only he gave his people his word think about it his word himself let's just paint that that's him that's him being with us he said everybody next slide everybody knows that you have to train to hit your enemy and always God uses his word we must remember that God uses his word to De feed his enemy if God could think or could give have give his people anything better to feed his enemy with he would have done it so as I have said when God makes a decision that's the best that there is he never has to alter his decisions so the first decision God gave his people in the Garden of Eden to combat the enemy was his word they were fortified behind that word you know that was Jesus Christ that hedge of protection he gives us his word that we can live by man shall not live by bread alone but every word proceed out mou of God blessed be the name of the Lord I just got to thinking on something the other day I got to thinking that you know we've heard it but I got to thinking about something that was lost I was sitting there I was just fellowshipping with the Lord and I got to thinking I just it just came out of me and I was just thanking you Lord thanking that you saw me down through the sands of time that I got lost but I'm only going back to where I come from in his mind before the foundation of the world then I got to thinking about about brother bam said we're just in the pawn shop of the devil when you start thinking about that I started thinking are you lost in the pawn shop or are you lost for the redeemed are you lost in need salvation under repentance or are you lost uh redeemed are you one of those that were on his mind before the foundation of the world glory to God you know without him God himself coming down from G living us a life living us an example you know what a great sacrifice you know I just heard a minister say a sacrifice is not a sacrifice unless it's a sacrifice huh come on so when you think about it what are we making little sacrifices for the Lord God today getting out of his way that he may live and have preeminence in our life that he may be able to walk through us and go get himself more glory and honor and praise to his name cuz he's worthy to be praised blessed be the name of the Lord it just gets me so fired up I'm sorry but I can't help it it just BS out I about want to run around circles right now man Hallelujah so it just gets me so fired up so he came to live I get hit my nose he lived to die to live through us and fellowship with our Mighty Redeemer you know Philippians 3:9 through1 says through the Faith of Christ the the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him in the power of His Resurrection come on I'm a witness you know I've seen him I've seen him in times you know God manifesting his word in my life I had a bush hog fall my foot and then after it happened you know I got up and Shu it off and sit in the belly thing God was giving me scripture and I was bushhoging right after that and he dropped down and dropped in my thought he said I'm a very present help in a time of need when I was coming off my medication different things he said man shall not live by bed alone but every word proceed out of mouth of God God gave me them scriptures as I had need of them and we stay in tune with him he'll give you what you need as you need it Philippians 4:19 I got it wrote down but my God shall supply all your needs huh so I had this little thought yesterday and said I was driving down the road on the way to work I said without without the fire what good is the oil huh what good is the oil takes the fire to put the oil into action well I sent that to some buddies send it to the group sent it to my brother and and I get to thinking he said are you not are you a light of the world or is your a flame are you a flame a fire in Action a billboard for Christ and I sent that to a brother and he sent me back this which you know I just so thought it was so awesome because the same God that worked through brother brandom the same God worked through all the prophets Works in you and me so God started dropping down my heart and then look what he said he sent me back what the prophet said after I sent him that little thought I had so brother bandam said here in the rising of the sun it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come the fire is made to connect that octane with the gasoline and when that that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every part every move for he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with the Dynamics notice it's the spirit that qu quickens it's the spark that fires it's not gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas come on Hallelujah you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word it's the father living father the father has sent me so I send you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything I do only that which is pleasing to God now as he has sent me so I'll send you with the same mechanics and it takes the same Dynamics to operate it and these shines shall follow them that believe follow them that claim the mechanics and have the Dynamics will take its place huh come on I just love that I was like see that's the same Lord that gave him that same thing just gave me that little thought it's just the same just in a different way you know and and first Thessalonians 1:5 says for Our Gospel came not in word only but in power of the Holy Ghost and in much assurance that kind of caught me I'm like I want to look it up so I Googled that and it said Assurance Assurance a positive declaration intended to give confidence of a promise uh confidence or a certainty in one's own abilities so what are we having confidence and Assurance Blessed Assurance he huh what do we have that in Jesus Christ Our Hope uh we standing on that solid rock that Firm Foundation where are we going and then it goes on to another definition of it the act of assurance we making a declaration in terms that furnish ground of confidence confidence in the boldness coming boldly before the throne of grace that you may be able to receive what you ask for receive what you ask for believing for all things are possible he said a firm persuasion a full confidence of trust freedom from doubt a certain expectation let us draw near when a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith the firmness of Mind undoubting steadiness excessive boldness huh and it said any WR writing or legal evidence of the concy of property huh are we a bought property we are we we have a Blessed assurance that we're his well that word kind of caught my eyes so then I looked that up and it says the con concy in the terms is the act in one which the ownership or a proper property is transferred from one to the other I said Jesus didn't Jesus say he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also huh see he's transferred the power now from the apostles now all the way down to us now we're bride of Jesus Christ we have the same power that he has obviously we're not going to be raising the dead Healing The Sick doing this but as we had need of like I said earlier he'll Quicken them words and bring them to you blessed be the name of the Lord you know turn the slide there brother is that Ephesians yeah Ephesians 6 says here finally Brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand withstand in that evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore he said having your loins GED about with the truth having the breastplate of righteousness and your feet sh with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the The Shield of Faith where with you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God come on next slide next slide oh let's keep it going baby now look here Revelation 19 what he say he said let us be let us be glad and rejoice and get B to him for the marriage of the L lamb has come and his wife ha made herself ready come on and to her he is granted she should array and fine linen clean white for the linen of the righteous of the Saints and he saith unto them right blessed are they that which are called unto the see blessed are we how blessed are we a privilege called out people it just gets me fired up we ought to be shouting and Bing the roof off this place huh come on so the blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb he saith unto them these are the true says and I fell at his feet and worshiped them and he said unto them see thou do it not I am a fellow servant of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy and and I don't know if we still going there okay you w reading because I had to put it on T slides and he said I saw heaven open and behold the horse the White Horse and he sat on he that sat upon it was called faithful and true and righteousness and he judges and make war now we'll just think about that's why wanted to pull this together cuz I just love this when I found this a while back but we go and see God now coming into being a mighty warrior you know you imagine him right here he says and he said his eyes were a flame of fire and I and on his head he were had many crowns and his name was written that no man knew but him himself his he was clothed in the vure dipped in Blood and he had his name and he was called the word of God and he said and the armies which were in heaven falled upon him and clothed in Fire and fine linen and white and out of his mouth go knoweth a sharp sword huh what is it coming out of his mouth that spoken word I had a thought One Time sword let's just break it down take the s word sword spoken word huh it cut divide and even discern the thoughts and intents of the heart come on Blessed Be In The Name Of The Lord I said like I said my thoughts from the very beginning is getting Christ the word and action finding whatever you have need of come on in the scriptures in the in the word and and making it our provation our possession and getting the land that the Lord God has given us no matter where you are or where your heart's at you know I was just thinking I had a listen to this ministry I just loved it I'll just Shar a little story he said he typed this he he T he typed it like the stove he said you have your children you you know you tell your kids because you love them don't touch the stove you know and you know he said it's just like our nature we want to go touch the stove you know because we don't need to touch the stove and he was laying it out and he was real good I can't say it good as he does but he's real theatrical with it but he's laying it out there and he said you know first thing you know you watch this little kid is it starts inching towards the stove you know it want to go touch the stove you know and he said then you yell at it and then it runs you know and it made me think about Adam in the garden he's in trouble he run man always running from the presence of God when he's in trouble huh so but what he said here he was really breaking it down he said but then when that little baby go touches the stove it comes crying to Daddy come crying to Mama and it brings him up there and then he knows now why he told me not to touch the stove he loved me and he said that's the same way that our God is is he saw all of our thoughts before the foundation of the world he loved us so much he knew he was going to touch the stove but he was wants us to come and say father I'm sorry I messed up I need you I touched the stove I messed up Lord help me I just love that I thought that was so powerful you know and it just it it just like wow so simple but powerful and I had this little clip here we was just listening on the way here I told him I was going to share it interpretation brother Timothy had been in Uganda and preached a meeting and he came home and he was sick sick and he couldn't preach on he couldn't preach on Wednesday night couldn't preach on on Sunday because he was so sick and he was just completely wore out he was I think on the couch if I've got this right and God does everything perfectly here he is on the couch watching my streaming and as she's speaking in tongues he gets the interpretation thank you Lord he said this went through him as tongues went forth and it won't leave me I felt weird to tested to somebody that was at the service but for two days it keeps going through me this is my word you create the atmosphere and I will feel it come on and as you praise me walls will fall as you praise me I will will fight for you praise me praise me come on Amen that just fired me up this morning thinking about it you know I was just sitting there we just had a fellowship with brother Matt you know I know he wouldn't mind me saying this but he told some stories that last year at Louisiana there he said they was down there and you know how everybody's worshiping and stuff and they might the ministers might go in the back he said they went in the back he said next thing you know brother Donnie broke out speaking in tongues he said the most fluent Spanish he had ever heard in his life he said then he come with an interpretation he told it and he said then he started speaking in like Egyptian he said he told he he said it was so fluent he said it was he said it was upper room stuff he said and when it when the interpretation came forth said uh preach my gospel I'll be with you you've waited decades or something and paraphrasing it waited all these years and now go you know basically I'll be with you and we're seeing the manifestation of the power of bride of Christ but reason why I said that is because he said brother Andrew told him to write it down because this is for the bride this is for all of us that's why I I shared that clip because that clip when they speak in tongues it ain't just for them out there we're all a part of the body of Jesus Christ we're trying to rise up we're going to rise up we're going to have the victory over all this we're going to be getting ready to get out of here bless be the name of the Lord you know so it just got me thinking I had that you know I heard that clip it was right before I had on here see that's the atmosphere we can create right now no matter what we can get rid of all fears and we can come boldly before the throne of grace believe in that all things are possible casting down imaginations bringing every thing every imagination Into The Obedience of Christ the word what do you have need of use Jesus Christ the word if you need healing speak the word if you need Deliverance or chain breaking way making speak the word if you have need of Salvation or the baptism of the Holy Ghost speak the word what they asked Peter what must I do to be saved he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord then you can apply the Tok and the blood of the doorpost and walk in the spirit as he is in the spirit we're Miss Jesus Christ it's our power and authority to go possess the land he's gave it to us speak and go forward believe for all things are possible you know the devil came preaching a lie to Eve he comes preaching to all of us lies all the time I I can tell you as simple as he comes there'll be times I'll feel that little bug you know when you're about to get sick there's been numerous times now I can't tell you how many times I felt the bug start coming and I didn't say a thing I was like I'm not going to even speak nothing and I just kept on believing next day felt great I can tell you there was two different times I said I'm kind of feel a little sick next day sicker than a dog why because he came trying to give me a little box rattle snake try to come give me a little something in my mind contrary to God's word but you know he's a very present help in a time of need and if you need it and you need healing no matter what but just keep that's what I put down here you know God himself wants to uh manifest himself in your life with power and demonstration that he can walk through you that he can be a manifestation of himself in you he is the word that's what my whole thought was that's him living through us that is such a blessing you know I said I put on here just keep testifying keep believing no matter what no matter what what what you're going through keep your never let your testimony be negative only believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and will help you overcome Whatever It Is God bless you hope us let just create this atmosphere I don't know what I'm supposed to do after the Bible study uh Brother David let's go baby let's get fired up bless be the name of the Lord let's that atmosphere come on

we could read the scripture and go home we've had church I got called away and listening and I thought man I I got to get back into studying here and praying and or I'm I'm not going to be able to make it out there so as a good exhortation there brother Tommy appreciate that that'd be all for the music this morning thank you musicians enjoy you're singing and and just pouring out to the Lord and we appreciate it and turn in your bibles if you would to the Book of Romans chapter 8 well y'all give me a little bit more time this morning so aren't you enjoying what the Lord's doing for us in our services and just a move of the spirit and and the service we had last Sunday and this Wednesday and and we trust that he just keep moving today and you know there's something happening and I've been saying it and it and it's it's a it's a move it's a move it's a move going on and and uh people are becoming to see the realization of of who they are the hour we're living in and and what God has got what God has called us in this hour to to be and to do and so we just want to kind of continue on our thought from last week on restoring God's domain and uh we could just I think we could preach for for weeks on it but we'll we'll take another little portion of it today and and break it down I'm going to read this to you before we read our scripture he said now here he is amongst his church today made flesh in his church certainly Elohim now if you could only realize that you men that you were made to be a amateur God you're a Son of God you're an heir of God and you have a domain amen that's three pretty good things he give us right there he made him a God over Earth he gave him dominion over everything in the earth he says that's right he gave him a Dominion he's a king a God and he said and where he got his fall he said he could speak to the trees be changed and plucked up and set over here and the winds and the waves and be still and it stop he was a god an amateur God a Son of God listen like you're a son of your father he said and all the world is groaning and waiting now listen we talked about the creation and the foundation of the world and all the world from eons and eons of times he says it is the world is groaning and it's waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God waiting for the church to get back in its place again sons of of God to be made manifest waiting for that hour he said oh I hope this don't hurt but I just had to say it he said the church is so far away from its place when he's preaching and we think we think the the that the the time has arrived and he says no the church is so far away from its place and he says it needs to get back to the sons of God again rulers governors of the earth under spirit spiritual reain he said it will be someday and he said and when the chief one comes Jesus Christ the great Millennium nature is groaning for that day can you imagine right now as we sat in our pews all of nature since the creation is moaning and groaning for us to get where we're supposed to be what a responsibility but he made a way he showed a way he gave the word he gave the Spirit he gave a way for us to get there we just got to get there we got to believe it in ourselves Romans 8 let's see what Paul has to say and I'm going to read this pretty thoroughly and and then if you'll stand with me for a little while and and then I'll let you seat I'll let you have your seat for the rest of the service how's that there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we ask with we in that Spirit we know was the logos it was all that God ever was all that he ever is and all that he ever will be the spirit so when we talk about Spirit as we're preaching today I want you to think about that little white light he said would begin to form and it begin to come down and it inhabited on Adam and inhabited on Christ and inhabited on Pentecost it's inhabited on us today the little white light the spirit he said for the law of the spirit of Life of Christ has made us free from the law of sin and death aren't you thankful for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in who us who walk not after flesh but after What Spirit brothers and sisters God is is is seeking the acts of the spirit I don't know about you but I'm seeking the acts of the spirit we're we're going to get into some of those acts before this is over with and he said for to be carnally minded is to be spiritually mind or but to be spiritually minded is life and peace so when you're living in spiritually minded places you're living your best life when you got the spirit move in you and the spirit is is is dwelling in you and leading you and guiding you you are living your best life and that life is a life of Peace it's happiness it's Joy it's overcoming it's victory that's why the spirit this logos is so important to be living and dwelling in our lives because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it's not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh canot pleas God you cannot please God that's hard isn't it right when you get in this flesh God is not pleased he when you get in this flesh you lose power you lose Authority you lose Dominion you lose all the good things that God has given you why because you're no longer dwelling with a spirit inside of you now you're walking and doing the things you want to do right but you not in the flesh but in the spirit so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit he has none of this no power No Authority like we said no no no Victory no vision no domain no Kingdom no no uh no no rulership no governorship and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life remember when we talked last week and we had Adam standing there and and the prophet said he was As Dead As could be but he said when he breathed life into him and the Spirit came in he said he jumped up and he began to move on and he moved on and he moved on because of righteousness now watch what the next verse says but if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you you mean the same spirit that was breathed into the life of Adam as he stood there as a dead tree dead as could be the same spirit that now comes into Jesus Christ and quickens him it made him jump and move what if that same Spirit dwell in you what will it do to you what if the spirit get on us what will it make you do how will it make you act what will it how will it make you live in your life I'm not talking about running and jumping and shouting and screaming and and I'm not talking about shouting and speaking in tongues I'm talking about the life you [Applause] live therefore brethren we are deaders not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if you live through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many are as led by the spirit of God they are who the sons of God there's power in that scripture right here Paul is speaking to us and he is identifying who we are there's sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear we don't have to fear you know the devil has used fear to sweep across the country to sweep across the Believers and tell you you don't have what God has given you for as many are led by the spirit of the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage against the fear but you have received the spirit of adoption wherefore we cry ABA father now there's two elements I want to not I want you to notice real quick on ABA father father when you speak Abba you speak a word of intimacy so here now the word Abba it's a motivator of this prayer and it's the spirit of sunship and the spirit of sunship I want you to know is the opposite of fear so now he's crying you're crying ABA father because why we've got a close relationship now with God it's more than just a god out in the universe it's more than just a God that was back in the in the Bible days it's more than a God but it's a god of today that we can say God you're my father ABA father but the problem is is where people stop and stay right there ABA father and that's as far as they go there's two parts to the ABA father obedience oh how many times people want all the good stuff around the message oh they want all that they want the healings they want the emotions they want the shouting they want the dancing they want a Holy Ghost fi church and they want they want all that while they're there they want God to heal them when they're sick they want God to heal their children when they're sick come on but they only are crying partially Abba Father because obedience means that we now have become submissive to our own will and are giving our life to God the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God you mean the spirit is going to Bear witness sure it is when you're living the life of Christ the spirit's going to say hey look at this right watch what's happening in their life let me show you how I work as the spirit of God you said I don't know where you get that well I find it in when Jesus was baptized it started right there Jesus was baptized and said he was baptized down straight straight forth he come forth up out of the water and what happened it said a spirit descended down like a dove and it lit on him and it said this is my son in whom I beloved Son whom I well pleased to dwell so what does that say for us if the children then hirs Hees of God join HS with Christ you mean that everything God allowed Christ to do I own that same ownership I hold in my hand the very power power that Jesus Christ had on earth oh you have to believe it if you're going to do it you have to believe it if you're going to do it you know I told my son the other day I said you have to believe with all expectation that it's going to take place when somebody comes up for prayer I don't look down there I don't pray for him and say man I hope you get delivered no I'm looking for results when somebody comes and says I need a touch from God because my body is aching I don't say well I he might help you he might he might or he might not I look for results HS join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together you can have your seats may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word sorry to keep you standing so long but it excites me when when I see what what what God is doing in this hour it's more than just words it's more than just stories but it's a life it's my life am it's God using my life it's God using your [Applause] life I'm going to read some out of Ephesians 1 too if you just want to follow along and listen Ephesians 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from our father from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ bless be the be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places according as he hath chosen us here we are again personal possession he's chosen Us in him logos before the foundation of the world that we should be what's it say holy that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to Pro praise the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted and beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence listen now this is what I want to get to having made known unto us the mystery of his will you me God's Will from before the foundation of the world that's where he said you were and now he's going to make known the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he ha purpose in himself listen that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in all things Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom we also have obtained an inheritance how many is thankful for an inheritance now physically speaking Naturally Speaking we love inheritance I've spoke a little bit on this and you're excited to get an inheritance but this is an inheritance above all inheritances an heir just as Christ just like Christ an heir of all things that g that that God ever was an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own that we should be praised and Glory of his glor who first trusted in Christ I'm about to finish in whom we also trusted that after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after ye have believed you were sealed once you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory there's a lot in those two scriptures there's a lot in those two scriptures that we could stay on and and as Paul begin to preach those things you know it confounded the people that was around him they couldn't accept they couldn't understand what he was talking about when he was talking about those things in in Romans 8 they couldn't understand what he was talking about that that that how do you cry ABA father they knew from Old Testament what what what it was tied to but they couldn't put a relationship together that God cared so much about them that he cared so much about them that they can look at him and say you are my father now Stay With Me Prophet said after you're adopted you're adopted you're placed after that ceremony said and you've been put into the body correctly you're a son you're a daughter sure when you're born again you're that that's your birth but now he said now you got to be positionally placed now you got to be positionally placed and he says the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we're children of God and Jesus said whoever believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also so brothers and sisters there's no limitations we limit ourselves we limit ourselves because the world says you can't the devil says you can't be healed the devil says you can't have Financial peace the devil says you can't have a a nice home the devil says you can't have a good job the devil says you can't feel good but here we hear something completely different we hear that there's no limitations of what God can do when God is in your life and he's flowing through you and that spirit that logos is now living in you that's why it's important that we now are here to restore God's domain in our life and we're here here to see that let our lives speak for themselves brothers and sisters I thought about this and it came to me it's time to quit lingering around the message and start living it do you believe what he said if you do live it he says this child is born into a home and he becomes a son the very moment he was born into that family and he said that boy gets a Tut [Music] oh yeah you going to be you're going to be a child of God you going to get an [Applause] education it depends on how how you take it what kind of education you get but he said that boy gets a tutor over him and that tutor would take and and and he would take the father and go to the father and he say your son is progressing or whatever it was and and he said uh there it is on the day of Pentecost this is where they the Pentecostals failed to see this he said that it that the let me give go the Holy Spirit may be willing to give them but look you were born again of the Holy coost this is my brother it was you as a child you was just as much as a child as you ever could be you were born in a family but yet the tutor which is the holy spirit he said it was touched over the church as it's maturing so you might be born by the blood of Jesus Christ but have you found yourself positionally placed right there's a difference between being a child and being a son and a rightful Heir that's exactly right and this is what he's talking about he says now this tutor in the natural went to the father and said now here this boy's not going to be doing very good I'll try to teach him but he won't listen how many times we see that around the message of the hour they try to teach us the word comes forth the prophet came forth he told us how to live told us what to do how to go about it how to get all these blessings but we don't listen ex he was close brother Joe he said he's got his own headstrong way that's exactly right he just won't listen he's he's going to be this or he's going to be that and the father realizes right then that that boy cannot take over his domain that's right that's right he said because he wouldn't he'd run through it you see what's happening here you got this this boy that's born into a family a child here and he's not obedient to the word he's not obedient to the teacher or the instruction and he says the man looks at him the father says I can't give him I can't trust him I can't give him this domain because if he does the prophet said he'll run through it he would mortgage the farm he'll sell it off he'll drink it up he'll run around so what's he gonna do he's going out and doing the things of the world you see you can't live and do the things of the world and expect to have the domain of Christ in your life it will not work you'll never be BL he said but this boy after he got to a certain age you see after he got to a certain age you see this tutor had a job to do are you with me this tutor had a job to do it was his job to teach to reveal exactly what the father expected of his son oh we've had a tutor in our age we've had a tutor in our age and a lot of times people want to look and they want to look back at at at the message of the hour they want to look at the gifts they want to look at look at the the discernment and those were all good and we needed those because it encourages us and it lifts us up and I believe we'll see it again and we already are seeing it in our day but there was more it was the mystery of the will of God is what the prophet was sent for it was to show you that you're not just a child of God you're not just saved by the blood of Jesus Christ now you're stepping into a position of ownership and you're stepping into a position of a domain and you now got the authority of Jesus Christ that's rich now I'm telling you that's whole milk right there if you can't handle it we'll have to stop but I believe we're living in a day when you're going to see The Acts of the Apostles all over again I believe it today more than I've ever believe did in my life and he says here's this boy he said any Minister knows the places of the sun he said it was Old Testament teaching the father becomes aware now he said he becomes aware now that this boy was not worthy he didn't dis on him aren't you thankful you say man I started out this when I was 16 years old man I've made a lot of mistake since I was 16 years old maybe you've only been there for a year two years maybe you've only been serving God for for 5 years 5050 years it doesn't matter but he don't disown you until you get to that place he just keeps working on you he keeps building you he keeps sending the tutor your way you keep getting an education by the School of Hard Knocks if that's what it takes and he begins to work on us and mold us and build us he said why because he couldn't put confidence in him he couldn't put confidence in him and he has to be placed he has to be identified he has to have the same Authority that his father has and that tutor has to show him that and tell him that that's right he said but there notice his father he said the day come when this boy maybe been all right and he's a worthy man he listened to the father he listened to the father he took instructions he's a good boy and he said the father then will take him out of into the public street can you imagine you before this is Old Testament you go in there and you your father's talking to you and as you begin to talk and you begin to associate with your father and he says what's the tutor taught you well he taught me that I have to live by faith he taught me that God is the same yesterday today and forever amen he taught me how to be a father he taught me how to how to raise my kids he taught me how to how to treat somebody on the job site he taught me how to how to be a boss he taught me how to how to how to oversee the whole Farm Daddy he says let's go out on the street I want the whole world to know what you've been gone through and he says he takes him out there into the public Street and they put a a robe upon him and they put this robe upon him it's a tapestry of the family seal oh brothers and sisters aren't you thankful you've been sealed in the righteousness the righteous robe of Jesus Christ that seals you and covers you and keeps you and Paul saying here that he's predestinated to adoption he said this son came out there he was no longer like a servant to the tutor he was boss man it's quiet let me ask you this can God look down at you and say that's my boss I trust him so much I have so much confidence in her she lives the life to the tea she loves me she serves me she's the boss he's the boss that's my son that's it's my daughter he's no more under the tutor he's like his father brothers and sisters you mean we're going to come to a place that we live exactly like God did can y'all handle this he says and when he says that when he says he's just like his father he gives him certain things to do and the father tells him he says you might go take care of this field now and I want you to go over here and take care of of this or take care of that and I want you to take care of the slaves you take care of the cattle you take care of the Hogs you take care of the chickens you take care of whatever it is go into town and pay my bills he said he was in full possession because now he's adopted into that family he's wearing the robe the skill of the family crest is on back and not only that but he said now his name is on the check and his name on the check is just as good as his daddies brothers and sisters we cry today ABA father why because we're under the righteousness of the robe of Jesus Christ and we become to that intimate Place we've come to that intimate place and that a place of obedience where we can sit out here and we can see that the kingdom of God and our name is on the check that my name your name is just as good as Jesus Christ that's right that's EXA when you begin to think about that that that gets that just almost is mindboggling that you can be trusted enough but in the beginning that's the way it was and the word tells us that all that God was he poured into Jesus and all that Jesus was he ped what into the church how many's in the church this morning how many's bride this morning how many's f with the Holy Ghost let's see Hands this morning don't be ashamed of that got asked that somewhere and nobody raised your hand I thought my goodness is anybody got the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost let the devil know it do you have the Holy Ghost amen God is good this morning and the spirit begins to bear bear witness with our spirit and the children in the of the Bride of Jesus Christ and we find ourselves living in the power and authority and divine representation of God [Applause] Almighty listen all of creation is waiting for the manifestations of the Son of God he said what is everything waiting on it's what the whole creation is waiting for the manifestations of the Son of God it's waiting for the church to become into its position who was the son of God and Adam what was his domain the Earth he had domain over the Earth is that right he said Elohim he said that is I am God he said he was Elohim but now he's Jehovah and he said when he became Jehovah that is I am God and I've made some lesser ones under me lesser ones there's lesser ones under him in Africa in Asia Australia Kentucky Tennessee Arkansas Arizona yeah I'm even in Arkansas but he's made him to have dominion on this Earth he said man had dominion and whole creation is waiting to see the manifestations of the Son of God before when he called himself Elohim he was the self-existing one himself he said he was the self-existing one that that only nothing existed before him and there was no existence ever uh before him he was all that was in existence all sufficient all powerful allmighty self-existing one he said but in Genesis when he made man he said I am Yahweh I am Jehovah he said I am Jehovah what did that mean he says it means that I am the all exist one who has created something off of myself and he begins to hand this down over time and over time I'm I'm the self-existing one who now has created something off of myself to be a son of mine to be temporary or an amateur a little one of mine he said aren't you thankful to say I'm glad I'm a little one of Jesus I'm a little one of God thankful I thought about that I thought word the scripture says suffer not the little ones to come unto me suffer not the little ones to suffer the torment of this world suffer not the little ones to be beat down by the devil the little one the little God and Jehovah says it means he gave man to be an amateur and he said he isn't the self-existent one anymore but he exists with his family Jehovah the one who exists with his family I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God it's more than just being a child it's being a son or being a daughter and he says here brother brothers and sisters he says that the man was made to predominate over the Earth to have dominion he said if it was it was his domain that it was God over the Earth he could speak and it would be so if he could speak this and it would be so and oh here he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence now exists with his family and his little ones with him God is trying to place his church in a position are you with me this morning adoption he says placing manifesting taking them out of here and putting a ceremony on him visiting him with an angel tell him something he said I mean manif Stations of the sons of God when God manifests himself and sends him out why is it we want to sit around as Believers why is it we don't want to be God In Action because the word here says that once he goes down there he says manifest I mean he manifests himself and he sends him out he goes for and he says what is truth and he lives what is truth and he does what is truth he's manifesting Christ he said that's how you know who he is by his word and by his actions you know that he's a son or daughter of God he says we have to enforce he says we've got the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God has given us for God has a law and his word is Law and God made certain to claims to a church that therefore we have a right to force claims on Satan I say give it back we talked about this last week now we've got Authority because now we've been robed in the right Satan has no no position but to cash it how many wants to write checks on Satan you owe me you owe me my happiness you owe me my children on you owe me my marriage you owe me I owe you no Satan owes us and by the authority that God has given us to come and see this in manifestation the life that was in this it it it requires a claim to be put on the things that Satan has stolen listen to this having made known to us the mystery of his will what is the mystery of his will our adoption our adoption it shows you where you stand when you're adopted it shows you where you live it it it tells you what your family name is it tells you what what you can have and what you can't have and according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed Heath purposed this himself before the foundation of the world and he says God likes to work through man it gets better he said if God's programmed to work through man do you believe that God works through man he said he made man his helper on Earth you mean to tell me brother Tommy you are God's helper you're God's helper Caleb you're you're God's helper on Earth that God thought so much of you that he wants to work through man so much that he makes you your helper that he trusts you and has enough confidence in you that wherever you go you're going to do what he wants you to do that when you're at school you're going to you're going to talk and you're going to act and you're going to be what you should be as a young child and a school when you're on your job you're going to treat people right you're going to treat them just like Jesus would helpers on Earth am he says he was a savior he was a king he was a God he says that's what he was he was the attributes of father son Holy Spirit not three Gods but three offices in him and these are be displayed their selves the attributes of God that was in him in the beginning and God made his man in his own image and put him on Earth as a Lesser God and he said is it not written in your laws that ye are Gods wow you said you're putting a lot of authority on us depends on where you want to be in the word it depends on how you look at yourself in the word you know there's people that look at themselves in the word and they look at themselves always as the one that's beat down and and held back and the ones who who can't go anywhere there's other people look at themselves in the word and they see themselves as as as as Overcomers where do you see yourself in the word I see myself do an amate your God as a creator with authority and power why because I'm trusting that I'm living with the spirit of God in Me and God is satisfied with the life I'm living that he can trust me and have confidence in me and he can have confidence in you to Turn You Loose what Adam lost Jesus proved he had restored he stopped nature you know not since Adam was there many many acts like that and I you know I made this I make that statement and I got to thinking about it he said he stopped nature he he raised the dead he done everything but not since Adam had full control in the Garden of Eden has any been anybody been able to take full control of the entire Earth around them until Jesus came on the scene now we look back in the Old Testament and we see some of these old Testament Heroes and and Patriarchs we see Moses and can you imagine Moses and and Joshua and Gideon and Samson and David they all had special instances where God moved in their lives what was that Moses stood there he didn't stand there and say oh my name is Moses par the sea he stood there under the authority that had been given to him because God trusted him because he had a backside of the desert experience and the Holy Spirit incompass us body that's how David could take down Giants he stood under the authority of God Almighty but now the world is groaning he said it's groaning for God to get into his children again in realities he said to make things real and it stumbles the people I'm going to tell you it stumbles the people around the message can you imagine how God stepped into Moses when Moses said part the sea and the sea party can you imagine how real that became to the people that day but how was it when they got on the other side should we return to Egypt h it stumbles the people they can accept God In Action when they need him but they can't accept God In Action in an everyday life and brother and sisters we got to get beyond that we got to get beyond God in a time of trouble right and we got to get to where a God lives in my life he's more than a God in a time of trouble you're listening into the preaching of the of the fifth seal brother rand's preaching the fifth seal and he gets to about the 20th paragraph and he begins to talk about a little girl that's dying of Leukemia and he begins to talk about this little girl he said you know this little girl they brought her to me said she was pretty much I'm paraphrasing now he said she was pretty much withered away said she hadn't eaten and the doctors had pretty much giving her up I guess this little girl and and he says she was just a just a a sight to see and he said that so much that they had started giving her intravenous feedings and then he goes on say I'm not in the medical field so I don't really know how to explain what that means but I'll tell you what it means when you go through and you're starting to get tpn through your veins that means there's no hope for you to ever eat again they're sustaining you off of elements off of electrolytes off of proteins off of carbohydrates through a fluid put it into your veins because your stomach can't handle food you can't process food and here sits this little girl sitting here eat up with leukemia and he said they brought her to to me and and they brought her in the crowd and they told her where to sit and and and how the service would go pretty much and said that little girl hadn't eaten in in in days and years maybe months I don't know he didn't say but said she was sitting there he he began to pray for this little girl with leukemia and said before they left she started to cry I want hamburger and then he said when before they got home she ate all of her meal and he said in days she went back and she went back to school and this little girl she goes back and she enters back into school and he says so they took her to the doctor and the doctors were so amazed they looked at her and said there's not even a single trace of leukemia in your [Applause] child he said now that's instantaneously on the mark the power of An Almighty God listen to this next statement just blows my mind he says that God can go and take into the bloodstream cleanse it out like that and then put the pulsation of a new life back in there the old Heaven and the old Earth will pass away there'll be a new Heaven and a new Earth and he said I thought it was just so amazing when he said the pulsation what is a pulsation it's life this little girl that was dead and had no no hope and doctors had given up feeding her through IV tubing now she eats a hamburger now she goes to school now there's no trace of any kind of you said well that was in brother brandom's day I tell you if I hear that from somebody we're g to have a talk because brother Brandon didn't come to say let me show you what can do to this little girl he never come and said let me show you what I can do to this blind man let me show you what I can do to this dead body he come and said let me show you what you can do through the power of the Holy Ghost his life brothers and sisters was an example of what God is expecting out of us that's right you're saying you're saying every one of us is going to heal heal that sick every one of us going to raise dead I don't know maybe we will it's the same spirit it's the same spirit that was in the beginning in the logos it's the same spirit that fell down the day of Pentecost so why am I to limit what God can do through me why am I to limit what God can do through [Applause] you thank you Lord Jesus who would ever thought Tommy richman's gonna get up here and give an exhortation like that who am I to limit what God can do who am I to limit the people that are gifted to sing he said this creative act of almighty God to take a bloodstream that was contaminated with cancer until this little fellow was yellow and puffed out and within a few moments time had a brand new bloodstream you know God's doing those things in our day too we just maybe don't hear about them maybe we don't hear about them when they happen but God is still doing those very ax in this day too I encourage you to go and listen to the testimony of Elena butts has anybody heard it if you've heard it raise your hand few of us have if you haven't heard the testimony of atena buts I encourage you to go to go listen to it take an hour and 15 minutes to listen to it and another hour to cry because you're going to need it Weston sent it to me he was listening to it he sent it to me a day he said dad you got to listen to this but get your kleenexes because you're going to need it she's a sister who had a brother Tim prits down in men and she was diagnosed with non- hodskins lymphoma and I'm not going to go into the testimony but I want you to know that God is still delivering leukemia non- Hoskins lymphoma all cancers heart problems high blood low blood low blood whatever your blood issue is God is still in the healing delivering [Music] [Applause] business [Music] listen to this I'm going to take my time with this because I want you to hear the details I believe I'm not going to speak in his name he said but I'm going to speak in the revelation of my faith I believe that the hour is approaching this was in 63 March 22nd I believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored well he's not here who's going to do it did you hear what I said he's not here who's going to do it if he believed it with all his heart with all the faith that he had within him that's good enough for me I believe that you're going to see the power of God moving amongst the people in a way that we've never seen before healing of the sick maybe raising of the Dead restoration of Limbs I refuse to limit God anymore how's this going to happen he's going to have to find somebody that he can trust he's going to have to find somebody that he has confidence in that he can say I've got confidence in you and you got confidence in me you see belief and faith is only as good as the confidence you've got in God that's right well I I think that God can see me through this you're not going to get it I think God can heal me I hope God Can Can Heal Me I hope God can deliver my kids you're not going to get it you have to have confidence that God said hey you're a Min me and anything you speak anything you want anything you desire if you ask it in my name with the right attitude it's going to come to pass some of you believe that I believe it's all he's got to find somebody with confidence he's he can put his confidence and his power into the man that will follow the road and stay right with the map and go right on till he comes into that place of power you say well God has never done nothing like that in my life are you staying on the Road God has never I've never seen God do any miracles in my life I've never seen God do any of these things you're talking about brother Brad let me ask you are you staying with a blueprint are you reading the map and are you're following the road he's got to have confidence that you're going to stick it out on this journey thank you [Music] lordus listen to this God made his promise that he would send the holy ghost in the last days and these things would take place you could have doubted it but now he's coming doing it and the world is without excuse that's right if the world's with that excuse where does that put the church right where does that put the bride we have no excuses but to believe what he said he would do because he's done it he's doing it and he will continue to do it because he don't lie he don't fail he never quits but he's looking for somebody that'll fulfill the life of a mature bride that's right you know when a young man goes and he begins to talk to someone someone they think is special there's something that happened there's an attraction first that happens right he's generally not going to talk to somebody for marital reasons hopes desires if you're not attracted to them so there's an attraction that begins to take place and this young man what he begin to look for of the character of this woman he begins to look down at her he begins to look and see what kind of character she has does is she modest or does she dress her way self in any way to attract the the eyes of the flesh is she modest is she loving is she Meek is she supportive of her home the the ones around her her brother sister family is she dedicated to church that's right that's most important does she have the Holy Ghost that's really important and let me tell you this young man if if you're talking to these women you better have the Holy Ghost if you're talking to a holy ghost filled girl that's exactly got exctly right the Holy Ghost is where it's at amen so we need God is coming down looking for a mature bride and he's looking at this bride across the country and he's saiding what kind of character does she have amen amen thank you Lord Jesus he says that the false church with all of its cunning and diabolical power and makeup of political force and physical force and demons of Darkness come against this True Vine but this True Vine This is what he's looking for this True Vine with the fullness of spirit this True Vine with the fullness of spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did and as she's approaching The Headstone man we've been building on this for years we ought to be a little bit farther along than the [Music] basement what are we waiting for church what are we waiting for bride what are we waiting for in this hour when God is looking for a bride if he's going to descend for a bride she's got to be somewhat ready to ascend up because he's not going to come for an incomplete immature Bride As She nears her headship she's becoming like him that's where so many of us fail we're so struck on ourselves I don't want to be like myself I want to be like him I don't want to do the things that my flesh wants to do but I want to do spiritually what he wants me to [Applause] do and Jesus will come that for that bride and the groom that may be forever United as one listen to how it happens already the visible manifestations of what I've been telling you about is seen all around us The ecumenical move of the tears is factual he said but it's also a fact that the prophit for this last age must bring forth for a message from God that will forerun the second coming of the Lord for by this message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers and the restoration of the word will come with restoration of what power so many times people want to get back and they want to look back and they want to say oh we want to get back to Pentecost we want to get back to Pentecost if we could just and shout and speak in tongues that's not the Pentecost it's not ausa Street we're looking for isusa Street was a genuine Pentecost type experience yes they had God moving in their presence but we're so far beyond in along in our journey brothers and sisters than 19 whatever it was 1906 1909 when ausa Street happened that's not the Pentecostal experience that God is looking for God is looking for a Pentecostal experience that people will be filled with the spirit that they will overcome through the spirit that the acts will be victorious through the spirit that healings will take place through the spirit listen there when prior to the day of Pentecost when the spirit fell on the day of Pentecost what were these people they were carnally and worldly minded they were carnally minded you know once they received this end feeling that's when they became spiritually minded you couldn't think like Christ without the Holy Spirit no you you couldn't you couldn't resist the things of this world the carnality of this world without the Holy Ghost but when that Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost these self-centered desire self Desiring lofty people that was there on the day of Pentecost they lost their self ambition they was no longer worried about themselves because after Pentecost there was a dynamic change that happened in their life they didn't live like they used to their mindset was changed instead of being self-centered they became Christ centered and the deepest desire was to lift up and exalt the name of Jesus it wasn't how much money they could make it wasn't about how how many cars they could own how many farms they could own what kind of houses they could have it was about Christ and lifted him up to a status to where they were concerned about living like Jesus and the prophet said now listen this is where so many this this right here I want you to get I'm gonna slow down here give me just a few more minutes he says we know there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power he said the believer sense this sensed this past tense and their Spirits began crying to God for a new outpouring such was in the first century he said what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest the gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration so the people thought they began to cry they wanted more of God they wanted more of God and they began to cry out for God and so then began to give the gifts of tongues the gifts of interpretation the gifts of dancing in the spirit these things is what began he said they thought that was the long awaited restoration it was not when's the last time you heard that it was not he said for the latter rain came only after the former rain which is the spring or the teaching rain he said the latter rain then then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not come yet the prophet wasn't on the [Applause] scene who's going to turn the hearts back what were they what were they trying to get to they were wanting a real experience from God they were looking for a real experience from God and God no doubt moved on the scene he said but the prophet messenger who was sent to teach to people and turn the hearts back he had not yet come he said thus he said what was thought to be the restoration or the final quickening until the Rapture had not come why are we looking to isua why do we want that why do we desire that that's not what we were turned to he says he says no he says no one seemed to realize it he said to prove it was not real he said the people he said the the tongues would fall he said but what about this truth seed he said the people of God were being made ready by the word of the truth from the messenger to this age and he said and her and her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring forth the people right back to where they was at the beginning and he said and that's thus sayith the Lord back to the beginning what are we looking for back to the beginning on the day of Pentecost absolutely let's take note of some of those things that happened in the book of Acts you say well we generally when we first think of the day of Pentecost we think of what speaking in tongues clothing tongues speaking in tongues but that was just the beginning that was not the fullness of what God was doing the fullness of what God was doing was I have left the scene I go to prepare a place for you and while I'm gone you will be me in Luke begins to talk talk about this at the appearance after Jesus's resurrection and we begin to talk about it many miracles were performed listen to these Peter healed the lame man at the temple God answered Peter in a miraculous earthquake ananas and Safar were slain by the Lord signs and wonders continued to be done by the apostles Peter healed many from various cities prison doors were opened signs this is all in the book of Acts I can give you all the chapters if you want them the Lord appeared to Saul but Saul is UN was unsaved and responded to the preaching of the Gospel by an an ananas and ananas healed Saul's blindness Peter healed and jela Peter raised Dorcas from the dead did anywhere you see speaking in tongues and dancing and shouting and interpreting no this is the AXS of Jesus Christ this is the axe that we're talking about he said Cornelius saw an angel he and his family spoke in tongues they were saved by responding uh to the preaching of the Gospel of Peter Peter saw a vision on the roof and spoke out with the Lord prison Gates were opened Paul blinded elmus I listened to that story and I began to look I thought you know I don't recall that story how have I missed that story but you look in the in the book of Acts in Chapter 13 it talks about when Paul goes into to a land there there's a certain sorcerer a false prophet named bar Jesus and he says he was the deputy of the county and it says that he he was there to hear uh there was another one there who was a prudent man who was called to hear the word of God Watch What Happens here the two Spirits are always together one is fighting the other so here's this of God he's designed to hear the word of God and this sorcerer with stod him and tried to turn him away from the faith you think Satan don't work in our lives you think he's not there at your every move and your every question and your every desire and wants to try to turn you no it may be a friend or a so-called friend this stands by beside you and say you don't want to go there but in your heart you're Desiring that's why we need the Holy Ghost and here Saul which is Paul filled with the Holy Ghost it says he set his eyes on him you see what the Holy Ghost will do when evil becomes lurking around and it begins to try to get in there and gets with uh takes a Vengeance against some of God's children the Holy Ghost will set his eyes on am it doesn't matter if it's Paul it doesn't matter if it's if it's if it's Peter James John Matthew Brad Bobby it doesn't matter what your name is but if you got the spirit of God it begins to set its eyes upon the enemy and as he set his eyes upon the enemy through the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said he took a mischief and he said oh thou child of the devil and he called him out thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness and he put his eyes upon Him wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord and he calls this guy out and he says behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee he didn't say I put my hand upon you no but he was filled with the Holy Ghost so he was speaking with authority through his own lips and he said the hand of the Lord is upon the and thou shalt be blind and you shall not see the Sun for a season that's what happens in the book of Acts that's the kind of H Paul heals a man Paul heals a woman possessed of evil spirit miraculous earthquake loosen the chains in the doors of the Philippian prison in Ephesus 12 men speaks in tongues and prophesize Paul performs other miracles in Ephesus Paul raises from someone from the dead Paul's not affected by the Viper my fit's not broke when the bush hog falls on it you say why you keep referring to brother Tommy because brother Tommy keeps telling us [Applause] testimonies God in action brothers and [Applause] sisters what a marvelous time he says in a promise in his Bible here and he says it's impossible for him to lie therefore if it's promised in the Bible We Believe It soul body and spirit it's impossible for him to lie if there's any fault it's in [Applause] us it's not in God that's right you can't blame God for the things you're going through God is obligated to his word and he has sworn by his word so it's not God failing if there's any f it's going to be pointing back at us I'm not living the way I should live therefore God can't work through me that's right I'll tell you the closer I get to God the more God uses amen that's in all aspects of your life I listen to a lot of lot of preachers around the message I listen to a lot of things that's going on because I think with current times we have to know what that God is doing in other other places other churches it's the same things that's happening here he said a few nights ago in a prayer meeting a man said to me the Holy Ghost wasn't given but only 10 or 12 on the day of Pentecost boy that puts laments on God doesn't it that don't put that don't give us a lot of a lot of Hope or ambition and God using us does it but the prophet said he said well I said well then what about the 120 there was at the same time that received it what about the 100 what about those down at the house of Cornelius when the Gentiles received it 33 years later and Paul asked and they said have you received the baptism of of the Holy Ghost since the since you believed and they laid hands upon him and they received the Holy Ghost setting in the Church of Corinth in order and he said he also set the church the apostles the prophets the teachers the evangelists the gifts the healings all of those marvelous gifts years and years Beyond Pentecost let's stand to our feet years and years and years Beyond cost musicians if you come where do we stand this morning I got excited the other day you know I get to I get some windshield time I call it I get to drive to one to go places and I turn my music on and I or I listen to preaching and I was listening to preaching going down the road man I got excited and I got to thinking about this because I've been studying on this and I got to thinking about I thought God I just want to be what you want me to be yes I want the Holy Ghost to live in my life I want people to know that the Holy Ghost is what's doing the work in my life I want the holy ghost in my family and then that statement come to me and I thought about it I thought God set me on fire and let the world watch me burn let the world watch me burn as an overcomer through the holy spirit let the world watch me burn as I'm Victorious through the holy spirit let the world watch my children burn as they on fire for God am that's my desire how many wants to be set on Fire by the holy spirit this morning and how many will look the devil in the face like Paul did and set your eyes upon him and say watch me burn amen amen let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this day we thank you for this little lesson we've had and Lord Jesus we just trust in that his encouraging words were spoken and identification was taking place to tell us who we are in the hour we're living in and that we shouldn't put limits on ourselves of what God can do through us we shouldn't put limits on God that we shouldn't put limits on on what you're capable of doing that you are still a Healer you're still a deliverer you're still Victorious you're still an overcomer that the very things that happen in the book of Acts we'll see them happen again because the prophet told us that those very things all the healings the the Miracles The Marvelous gifts that were given to Apostles and Prophets and teachers and they go years and years and years Beyond Pentecost [Music] Lord we love to feel good we love emotion we we love you know the we know the prophet said anything it's that's dead has no emotion if there's not an emotion in it it's dead you need to bury it and Lord we love it when we when we feel like shouting we love it when we feel your presence we love it when we when we want to dance and we want to move we love it when we feel those things but God we want so much more in our hour as Sons and Daughters elected a a and sons and daughters that have been adopted into your family as we put on this robe of righteousness we want what you want in our lives overcoming power Victory not

break me MO me make me whatever you would have me to be Lord and for every family in this church Lord draw Us close to you as we see the time approach we see the the the the it won't be long Lord and
