next few days but if she does then we probably won't be here next Wednesday but Brother Brad will preach next Wednesday and then brother darl Ward amen a couple month ago we got him scheduled in for coming next weekend amen amen the following weekend so praise the Lord God is good isn't he amen let's just bow our heads and talk to the author of the book lord Jesus before we open this Bible we want to just talk to you for a minute Lord Jesus we want to first of all thank you for who you are and what you mean to us Lord Jesus and how grateful we are that we don't have to live life that we don't have to go through life Lord Jesus without you without the comfort of your spirit father Lord we're so grateful God when you told your disciples IES said you would send them the comforter and God that that comforter would lead us into all truth and that we would not be comfortless I will not leave you comfortless father we're so grateful that that applies to us today Lord we know that until the bride leaves the world and you lift your spirit up from the Gentiles Lord we know that your people will always be occupied Lord Jesus by your with your spirit in their hearts we thank you for that tonight Lord and we ask God Lord that you just take the meditation of a heart that which we feel that you've been pressed upon our heart to speak tonight Lord that you'll just he take it and speak what you want to say and help me to completely stay out of it father so that Lord everything would be pleasing to you and it would be all according to your will father we do all already and that once again believe Lord Jesus that those that are not feeling well will raise up again and be just fine because Lord we know that by your stripes they were healed 2,000 years ago and we've already claimed it we believe it with all of our heart so father there's only one thing to do and that's for to watch it happen and we just ask Lord now that you'll take the reading of the word meditation of a heart Bless the people that have come Lord far and wide and those who couldn't make it Lord we ask Lord you'd bless them streaming tonight heal them Lord and raise them up in Jesus name amen and amen I just didn't feel like I was quite done with my sermon last time amen so we're going to kind kind of keep going off of that and it'll certainly be uh it a little tap into that little series of the Gospel in a nutshell amen we're going to go back into that for just a little bit if that's okay with you amen amen so let's just read a couple scriptures and we'll get started here amen and see what the Lord will have I think if we want to go to Hebrews if you will turn your Bibles to the book of Hebrews amen there was a quote that I kind of come off come off of that I really liked and I just thought that uh it's so much deeper perhaps than what we realize and so I want to try to take it as take it to a new depth basically amen and we spoke on it a little bit Amen on our last sermon amen but we want to speak a little bit more Amen on that amen Hebrews 12 and verse one wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set down before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God in Revelations 3 Revelations 3 and verse 20 one Revelations 3 and 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may God add His blessings to the reading of the word amen you can be comfortable at this time and have your seats while I preach for about a half hour or so amen amen it's putting it just a little bit different right amen we hear the same thing all the time amen is it nice to have comfortable seats praise the Lord I've heard of a Preacher way back in the stone ages amen making all of his congregation sit on rocks and stuff they didn't want them too much comfortable it would wouldn't be hard to get up and praise the Lord under those conditions amen amen but we thank God Amen for what he does for us amen and so forth amen so amen now praise the Lord I I I thought I would tell you well you know when you Don't Preach for a week or two you get a little rusty so y'all pray for me amen we wear this rust right off and amen have it have the metal shining again amen praise the Lord God bless you this evening amen so I'm going to take my cat off amen now let's just uh let's just take a thought here and I want to title this I want to title this very different but I want to talk amen um Amen Let me see what I've got to wrote down here God's motive and objective God's motive and objective amen now how many knows that brother bandam he taught a lot about motive and objective amen and now of course a motive is your purpose right it's your intent amen motive is God's intent what he had intended in the way that God what his motive was in doing things and and brother Brenham applied it to us and when I looked at this amen I looked at so many times where uh the prophet of God how he would he would talk about when he would talk about this he would say how that when you want to well let me just let me just uh let me just read it to you would that be okay he says now if the Bible says that he is the same yesterday today and forever then he's got to be the same in principle the same in power the same in action the same in motive and objective amen he's got to be the same in every way only in the Corporal body and when you plead anything to God he says you've got to there's got to be a reason for it it's just like the scripture as I've often said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it but if you believe that what you have said it'll come to pass you'll have what you said he says now that's all together controlled on motive and objective now before we get into our real thought I want to just kind of bring this in for a little bit if I could because we know that uh you got everything especially when you ask God something you've got to have the right motive for it the right objective for it so I wrote down here no matter what you do it has to have the right motive behind it now as human beings we can be connivers I say that because uh I've listened to it and I've I I've heard people conniving with me all right people have connived with me because they would ask me a certain question and I would answer a certain way but I know that them folks got another reason for asking it hello and sure enough it was you know so you got to you know it's hard to judge people's motive and objective but you got to have your motive right your objective right and I heard many brother B said many times that in order the only way that you'll have the right motive and objective is in other words you got to have the right reason for asking it God for anything why you know you know even your healing brother BR talked about why do you want to be healed why if you want to be healed so that you can go out there and live nasty again you probably won't receive your healing you got to have the right reason for it the motive and objective that you have another place he talked about he says and no selfish motive will worken brother as a preacher you know you might want to become a preacher because oh my you you listen to Brother Don and you hear people that have become popular boy they're you know they're a machine gun preacher well I that's what I'd like to be like you know I'd like to be popular well guess what you're going to fail sure as the world if your motive isn't right amen but I'm talking about taking a church maybe a preacher wants to take a bigger church it's a bigger church it's a bigger group there maybe be more money in it in the back of his mind hello I'll be more pop if you've got the wrong motive it'll never work no selfish motive will ever work amen so how many believes we got to watch our motives and our objectives but now God now let's take a turn here amen God had a motive how many believe you God had a motive in it all we already covered am me how that he was way before time and so forth and he had an objective something that he wanted to get done amen once again we're going to look at this if that's okay with you where's my book here it is so we're going to read a very familiar quote if that's okay herein brother bam says is set forth the love of God God desired in love a family of his own now how many knows because of the family that God has created amen amen a a boy and a girl meeting and getting married having children raising a family that's what was in the back of God's mind his motive was that he didn't want to be alone he wanted companionship let that sink a little bit I me know that's what God wants he loves your fellowship he loves when you're driving down the road and you talk to him I don't care if you think he don't hear you or don't know sure if he hears or not talk to him [Applause] amen maybe we ought to talk to him as much as we talk to ourselves sometimes because I have a bad habit of that wife who you talking to I'm talking to myself let me alone I'm having a good time here when you get older you do that you actually talk loud actually you don't just think uh well all right here's a new one brother Tommy you know what is's talking to yourself what is's talking to yourself talking to yourself is thinking loud I love it is that the truth you're just thinking out loud and you know what it is amazing if you'll put your mind on God put your mind on Christ when you think about God when you think about Christ man he does something for you there you go what brother tommye preach right you know I was I was clinging out the dog pin today brother Tommy while I was dogging pen getting my scoop getting the poo poo do dog poo poo picking it up I was thinking about you know I said you know the Lord was just kind of quickening things to me and you know and and I was thinking how that he was opening the valve and and and and and fellowshipping with me and talking to me and and you know and I I got to thinking about God and and and how much that God loves us and how did how did he in his mind he had one of the family of his own and how much he loves you and I thought you know I want to ask a church well let me let me say this before I forget it but I got to thinking about being up here preaching you know and how that when I was there God was just kind kind of open the valve so to speak and I thought you know that's what we ought to do don't you like it when the preacher actually amen gets out of himself and gets away and and and begins to preach yeah come on turn the valve open come on brother that's why we say come on brother preach it brother in other words turn the valve on don't don't turn that water speak on I want a big valve how many wants God to come and open the valve for us amen the flood come in that's right how do you do it Amen brother preach it brother open the mou I don't care if it's dark I don't care if it's a Wednesday night amen you can let God comeing in and have his way let the Holy Spirit come down right now amen and saturate your brains a little bit amen and then come down into your soul a little bit anyway I got to think of how much does God love us can somebody tell me how much God loved us how much God loves us do that again keep it out there look at brother John turn around look at brother John y'all see that that's the correct answer or that's the answer I was looking for that's right that's how much he loved us when he gave us on Calvary why when he was on the cross I was on his mind cuz I was thinking of preaching how that you know God said I know the thoughts that I have for you amen that they're good thoughts how many believes when God thought of you amen he had good thoughts when he was by himself and he was thinking he was thinking of you and he had good thoughts where was you job when was you when the sons of God shouted for joy and where was that at all back in God's mind God saw it that was God's intent God's intent God's motive was to have children not just children but sons and daughters like I said in the last message that are in the image of him how many believ we were predestinated to be conformed to the image image of his son if you're a Son of God it was his intent for you to be like him to be like Jesus amen then as I was scooping stuff up brother B you ain't got sent that well that's what I was doing I'm I was going to let you know amen that I thought you know why does God allow us to go through the things that we go through he wants Sons and Daughters of God his intent I hope I can pick this back up but his intent is that he what did he do it says that looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set down before him endured the cross despising the same and is sat down at the hand of the the right hand of the Throne of God how many believe that's where Christ is he's the right hand of the Throne of God then we read Revelations where it says that him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame now pull that into where brother B says you know amen he says God will do nothing for you until you first confess that he's already done it every chapter every verse how many believes that amen when when brother Brandon preached on adoption he talked about that Moses was amen he only loved the children so far but it was Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost that took him into the promised land and divided the inheritance and when he went into the promised land every place that the soul of their foot tread was theirs I was listening to brother B I won't bother go into my take my my my my phone and pull it up but he says you know the one thing he said that in that Promised Land it isn't that they were promised any kind of far bed of East and mean didn't mean they we're not going to have trouble but he said there's one thing it meant and that is that it meant that it was theirs so get up and take it how many believe that the land is ours this whole book Is Ours but you got to go and take it I believe that if you ever sit on the throne you've got to sit on the throne first in your mind amen that's why we're going to go there tonight we're going to go over to the Book of Revelation we want to look at that but we want to cover the process that God takes us through to sit with him in the throne is that okay give you a little line of my line of thought amen now back to my thought that I remembered to think I better say it quick or I'll forget it but the devil think about this why God went about it the way that he did why allowed us to fall be born in a sinful condition hello a fallen condition we were born in a fallen condition is't that right I thought you know wouldn't it be nice brother Danny if we all were just perfect you know we never said anything to offend each other never did anything to offend each other and we offend each other because we don't do anything and we offend each other because we do something you know you can't you know you're going to offend somebody but anyway if we had just been perfect well how many knows the devil was perfect the devil was at the right hand of God he was perfect he was the right hand man of God so to speak God's rightand man he was there in Perfection and what happened to him he fell he became dirty he become Fallen sinful huh we would say what in the world now God turns around what does he do with you and I we were born lost we were born Fallen we were sinful God takes that amen and he's taking us to perfection that's right he's taking us to Perfection amen now our goal how many would say our goal is to sit with him in his throne sure it is but in order for us to sit in his throne you won't sit in his throne but B makes it clear the Bible makes it clear that if you don't overcome only the Overcomers not those that almost overcome just about overcome no but the Overcomers are going to sit with him and what rule with him all right here we're going to stop go down another little Trail God's intent God's intent is for us to what rule with him how many beli we're going to rule with him we're going to reign with him and he uses the talents that he gave five talents two talents and one five two and one see and he gave him talents and one the one with five got five more and his the Lord said unto him Well done thy good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over few things so you ain't got to do a whole lot you don't have to be faithful over a whole lot just be faithful over the little things that God has given you amen but if you're not faithful in the little things you won't be faithful in the big things notice Faithful over guys been Faithful over few things I will make the [Music] ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord and he says that same thing about that had one that had gotten to two talents you've been faithful in the little things I'll make you a ruler now didn't brother bam tell us that all of this natural world here is a type of the spirit spiritual is that right and with that thought I really wonder what it's going to be like over there are we going to have cities are we have going to have Governors are we going to have Kings what's it going to be like now I've can come come up with this conclusion that it's going to be Beyond Your Wildest Dreams one little old amen over here all right well let me just give you a little more word brother bam said that he says there's no words in the English vocabulary to ever explain it you can't even imagine what it's going to be like so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it is going to be beyond your I don't want to say why wildest right because wild is you know beyond what you can imagine is what it's going to be over there and remember this how many knows we are here to train for over there this is a training ground this is a testing ground that's what this is amen praise the Lord for what's coming will there be cities will there be this will there be that well first of all let's look at what uh Revelations I believe one and verse uh six says or five and when and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth Prince King of the prince of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings huh how are you all doing Kings believe you're a king you're awful humble Kings and Priests unto our God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever that's right will there be what what's Heaven going to be like well let me just read you the word Revelations 21 and 21 it says and the 12 gates were 12 pearls every single gate was of one Pearl and the street of the city was of pure gold streets of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple there of it and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine on it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb was the light thereof and the nations of them remember this is after the Millennium all right after the Millennium when a new city comes down out of Heaven upon the Earth cuz that doesn't even happen till after the Millennium this is when that new city is set up eternity brother Bram called it amen being the seventh day is the 7,000 years but beyond that he says we go back into eternity so it's in this eternity with this city that's sitting on the on the hill and so forth is what we're reading about all right and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it look at there we still got Kings over there just who they are I don't know but it says that we'll have Kings over there those kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and the Gate of it shall not be shut At All by day and there shall be no night there and there shall they shall bring glory and honor of the Nations into it praise the Lord how many knows as we think about God now and what he had in his mind and what his intent was what his intent was and that is to get children have sons and daughters of God that are like himself first of all how many believes that the kingdom of God is within us now we have a kingdom we are in a kingdom and we are to subjects of that Kingdom amen and God is ruling where he's ruling in here or through here you also are ruling how many believes you're ruling how did we expect I I was thinking you know if God says that he's going to make us a ruler over many things then I figure and feel like we ought to be able to rule over the few things that we have here I got a scripture says that he that ruleth his own spirit is mightier than him that taketh a city how manyan know it's it's something else there's things that you've got to overcome because that's who God is going to live with is Overcomers not those that are defeated not those halfway not the lukewarm but those who have power how many believes you have to have authority to be a Son of God you have to have authority amen he came to his own his own received him not but as many as received him first John 1:12 I believe is are 11 amen as many as we received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God in other words Authority come on God hates a powerless church he hates a powerless people I can't help but listening to the prophet that God hates a cold farmal dead church people that claim to be Christians amen Peter said we're Lively Stones we're not dead stones we're Lively Stones this word is a Living Word flowing out from us amen so what does God do God is training us as children he takes us from childhood how many believe that to what brother bham called adoption I many remembers adoption brother BR taught adoption that just because you're born again now just because you're born again you got the Holy Ghost amen there has to be a whole lot of child training that comes with it amen you got to begin to get trained for for this we're training for something is what we're training for just over here no you haven't got a clue what's coming down to hatch we do have a clue but we can't imagine it we think after this I'm just going to go to heaven and have me a picnic eat peanuts and enjoy heaven you reckon that's what it's going to be no I imagine we're going to do things I imagine that what we have worked for what we have practice for amen is going to be exercised don't you I certainly do amen cuz you see let me see here how many knows we come back in the 19th Chapter of Revelations after after the Rapture happens brother brandham goes under the fifth seal teaching in the seals I believe it was the fifth seal he goes into great detail of teaching how that the bride goes up you know and how do she's there Amen in in in under the six seal while The Sixth Seal is happened the fifth not the fifth seal but the fifth seal is it Souls under the altar The Sixth Seal is when all of nature lets loose and volcanoes come and all the destruction of nature all of that lets loose but at that time we're in heaven at the marriage supper amen we're there and you can go look at this up because this is a little bit of Doctrine it's teaching but he says that after that we come back into Armageddon we come in back to Armageddon to the Lord's Supper you can read it in Revelations 19 where we come back and we take over the the world is that right take over the world come into that battle and there's a great battle that happens there amen now Revelation 19 and6 is on I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of a mighty thundering sing Hallelujah for the Lord our Lord God omnipotent reth in other words rules you know you I mean it's about ruling it's important to have good leadership good rulers we know that from the past administration to what we got now it's very very vital to have competent leaders we ain't got competence up in there very little competence that's right all but two Democratic uh uh Senators voted that we should have boys beating up girls in games I want to say this you cannot call it women's sports anymore you have to call it men and women's sports a mixed Sports because it ain't just women's sports huh but that's just go to show you where we're at how many knows mentally as the prophet of God said people's gone you got to have R good rulership and I don't know about you but I'm looking can you imagine let me just ask you a simple question how's it going for you since the Lord ruled in your heart how many's glad my my life is just so much better with Jesus ruling up in here that's right [Applause] why we've the whole congregation everybody loud thundering said glory to God he's finally ruling and when we get to the other side and he takes charge we're going to say it ain't no Trump in there it's Jesus in there W that's right you think that's loud wait till you get to that scripture it sounded like thunder people were glad for the new ad ministration that came in there was a new rulership where IND dwelleth righteousness they not going to be wi one drop of insanity over there no and you are part of that rulership you are part of that leadership how many knows and it's very important that one thing that we take with us that he's going to live with that is character character brother BR says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire during Revelations am me I want you to oh boy why because we know the devil was perfect and he gave it all up he didn't like that Perfection you and I are imperfect and we're thirsting for more of that Perfection we love Perfection we love Grace we love forgiveness we love God coming and cleaning us up and that's what God wants God wants us to be faithful amen because he's going to sit with us we're going to sit with him we have fellowship with him now don't we and we're going to see him face to face over there we're going to be with him in his throne according to Prophet we're not going to be out those Nations and as I begin to think on this I thought you know the scope of God's intent sometimes his motive and objective we have we we we sometimes go so extreme we think well if you're not into bride you're going to be lost well our mind we've been taught so much of that until we think that but even the prophet of God said that people will be there that we never thought would be there and people that we thought was going to be there aren't going to be there the Bible says that even on Judgment Day even on the white Throne judgment ain't that right some will be given life and some will be damned even after the Thousand Years people will be given life simply because of the Good Deeds they did to the bride huh that's why I think our mind and our scope of our thinking has to be a little broader than well it's just a bride now I want to say this that the bride is what I'm interested in I'm not re interested in giving my life in the tribulation period for my testimony and sealing my testimony with my blood and I'm not you know any of that we're not part of the Jews over there that'll give their life we want to be the Bride of Jesus Christ sitting here tonight why because we've got the material we've got the message to get us ready and that's what I desire Lord help me to be part of the Bride amen and what does it take God knew that it would take hardship struggle he wants somebody that's tried and true is that right my my my so as we think about this everything that everything about our life it's about battling is that right fighting it's about overcoming now let let me read you some more Revelations 19 when we come back brother brah says when he comes back from Heaven he comes on a white horse isn't that right and all of Heaven comes back with him on white horses is that right and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in in righteousness do he judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns how many believe there's he's got many crowns just like an athlete perhaps he'll get many gold or whatever it might be but you know he has many crowns he's King of Kings he's Lord of lords he's Redeemer he's savior he's deliverer on and on and on and on he's the captain of the hosts he's our all in all many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses clothed in fine linen clean and white and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron amen and he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God Amen and on his vesture and on his thigh was a name written king of kings and Lord of lords and I saw an angel standing in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying let to all the fowls that fly in the midst of the heavens come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God that ye may eat the Flesh of Kings and the Flesh of captains the Flesh of Mighty Men the Flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the Flesh of all men both free and bound both small and great and I saw the beasts and the kings of the the Earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army so after the S marriage SE there's going to be a big battle you and I going to be in it you don't think so go read the six seal you and I are going to be in it we're part of it why because we're coming back on white horses woo Glory folks if we can battle devil and depression and sickness and everything on this side say hallelujah don't have any fear amen now notice and against his army to make war against him and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought Miracles before him which with with which he deceives them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshiped His image these both were cast alive into the Lake of Fire that burneth with Brimstone amen with Brimstone and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse all right here's the scripture I was looking for which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fouls were filled with their flesh amen so where does this sword come from out of his mouth how many's used to amen when he we're going to we're used to that sword how many knows you use that sword I use that sword we have the king sword isn't it something how brother bam was given that sword remember he was up on the Suba the canyon and the King's sword dropped in his hand he was like what is this this is the King's sword amen why so we could say the bride is given the king sword we know all about the sword that comes out of the mouth because how many knows amen if you want to know how to be victorious amen it is because of the word of your testimony the confession of your mouth slays Devils when you speak Devils flee where you to that so that means a lot to us to know he me he's going to speak the word and he's going to destroy them just like you and I we speak the word to depression we speak the word to sickness all all those things even you getting saved even you getting saved took confession took something coming out of your mouth it came out of your mouth for with the mouth conf confession is made unto salvation that's why brother bams declar declared declared that if you want to have your healing if you want healing first you got to confess that he's already done he says and that isn't just in your heart say I believe it he says that's to publicly confess let everybody know I'm Healed confess it amen the same way with salvation the only way you get saved is to say Amen by his stripes no he was wounded for our our transgression bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and he said whosoever believeth in me shall not perish but have everlasting life you speak that and you say I believe that I'm saved and when you accept that by faith God comes down amen because the word came out of your mouth how many believes the word comes out of your mouth the sins go into the sea of his forgetfulness they're completely gone so we're used to that because a real believer oh the devil might make you think oh I don't know if I'm going to make the Rapture I don't know if I'm gonna do this I'm gonna I don't know if I'm that brother Bram says you know let your testimony if you say well I'm not a good Christian I I don't have much Faith huh if you confess that he says man you won't get nowhere you go down right there because that's what you're confessing amen how many believe that you're a strong Christian amen you're the kind of Christian God is looking for we're not going to come out of this Half Baked not halfway when I thought thought about the intent brother God's intention I remember to quote brother Braham said you know how that he said uh you know God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're halfway Christians but it's not God's intention for them to be that way it's their own ways they got mixed up with the plan of God in their life that's what makes them that way but God don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preaching he wants to be completely delivered how many God know he's preaching God wants a total Deliverance he wants us to be complete Christians woo the first thing you got to overcome the big thing you got to overcome is your mind Paul said casting every doubt every imagination casting bringing every thought into captivity to the word m that's right you might think well I ain't got much to overcome you got the biggest enemy that you'll ever have your greatest enemy is where living with you that right you had to overcome doubt and what does it happened because of that because you overcome doubt and you believe that I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God you have to first of all and I believe that's one of the greatest things you can ever believe and to know that you're one of his and then from there then what cuz you can never you'll never have the power to overcome these 10 senses your imaginations your reion your conscience amen how many knows if you ain't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't have your sins washed Amen in the see of God's forgetfulness your conscience will always bother you you can't get away from that you'll have that guilt amen you'll have that stain amen you won't have joy amen huh no so that has to be dealt with and when that gets dealt with the power of the Holy Spirit you had to do great battle to get the Holy Ghost you had to believe that it was for you and like our preacher said Sunday you could be here from what 14 or so teenager to your 90 asking God give me give me give me give me Lord I want I want I want you've got to accept sometime saying thank you Lord Jesus I believe it's mine and raise up and watch God confirm your faith amen then what does I do many different battles oh my how many believes that these things sound so Technical and and they are great when we come back even then when we come back with almighty God and he does what he speaks the word folks I'm here to tell you whenever whenever ever Jesus speaks speaks I don't know just what he'll say but he's going to destroy those armies he's going to cast them into a lake of fire and I'll tell you when I see those words coming out of my Lord's mouth amen I'm going to go look at it because I know it's fixing to happen how many know is that because we've practiced it here we become a soldier here we become a warrior here we learn to rule if you can't Rule now don't expect to rule over there amen rule what rule your own self first of all rule yourself rule over your house rule over your wife amen rule over church not rulers but leaders hello brother says we're not your rulers we're just your leaders and so forth just helping you out we don't look at ourselves like that even though we are rulers amen them that have to rule over you that's right every aspect young people think about it you've got some ruling to do all those thoughts that come in your mind either got to cast him out or entertain him if we can't rule say maybe our business our servants how are we going to rule over there so the practice is now how many believe that the practice is now and not just halfway but completely and so what does God do God has to child train us if you'll notice there in Hebrews it talks about let me just go ahead we got a little bit of time let's look at Hebrews for just a second because right after he says about Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set down endure at the cross despising the same and so sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God brother baham talking about character he says even Jesus's character and that he was perfected through what he said the Bible even says that he was perfected through suffering suffering not a life of ease but suffering none of us are stupid enough to ask God to let you suffer no but we are wise enough to say God help me for whatever suffering you allow me to go through to trust trust you in it amen because that's the only way that you get to be the kind of person that God wants to live with it's through the trials and the different things that God allows to come your way this keeps coming back into my mind so I'm going to go ahead and speak it but since my wife's diagnosed and so forth life or death matter I'm here to tell you my faith has went to another level to another level and you know I've realized this one thing one thing I've realized that the kind of faith that you have for your healing if you've got the right kind of faith for your healing you trust God in every trial that comes your way is that right those things that absolutely tore you up but it molded character in you you have to have that same faith when you come down to the door of death when you get ready to die when we get ready to die it'll take that very same Faith Lord here we go I'm trusting you Lord that when I come down to that door otherwise you will be scared you will fear takes somebody that has a real hold of God to be told you're going to die and to not fear and actually go through death and never fear I remember Jo brother Joe Hendrickson in the hospital he says sometimes that fear wants to get me brother Bor but I just shrug it off say get away from here my confidence is in Jesus Christ amen cu no doubt but that fear will try to get a hold of you how many beli that's what God is looking for sons and daughters that are fearless we don't have to fear even death it doesn't matter what it is he wants that kind of character in our life and guess what how many knows that it takes a battle it takes fighting because brother Braham says character is not a free gift character is what a victory in other words think about it think about all of us who have went through a terrible bunch of stuff terrible terrible things if you live this life very long you're going to have went through some bad things but now look at yourself now that you have I don't know I don't care who and how many or what what people have done you wrong hello in your heart you say I forgive them I don't hold one thing I can tell you this from my heart right here I don't hold one thing against anybody that's ever done me wrong hello no that's right I can smile cuz if I did huh that's right some people walk around oh I hate that guy I'm a Believer but I'm tell you what huh may not even say it but if you hold that in there you're going to have that bitterness hello how many know we've got to overcome bitterness amen and if you've got that love if you've got that love of God in your heart cuz how many knows better Bram says only perfect love is going to be in there so whatever you do all of your religious acts and everything you ever did ain't going to count you've got to have perfect love he said if you're going to go in there I've said it many times I'll say it again when you get over there there's not going to be no funny feelings between people thank you Lord no funny feelings that's right and you better before you get over there you better not have those funny feelings if you want to make it in and this is just a fresh Revelation amen as God was pouring it out I said my graceous if character is a victory let's keep the victory the devil will try to rob you of that Victory he'll try to rob you of that love he'll try to rob you of your faith he'll try to rob you of longsuffering he'll try to put bitterness in there by something else that happens so when something else happened don't never let it come amen are you with me no matter what comes always put your faith in God Amen because when you leave here that is what he's looking for and that's the only thing you can take with you is your character how many believe that how many's glad for the character that you do have sure we should all thank God thank you Lord for the character that we have now I don't think anybody could raise your hand and say I think I'm perfect when it comes to that I think I'm a perfect guy I a perfect character I don't wake up and I ain't got to have coffee I'm happy anyway no most of us got to have that ke caffeine or we're just grumpy well anyway so to speak hello but there's still areas in our life Lord help us with those areas isin't that right continue Lord I want that character that you're looking for that motive that you had before the foundation of the world was to be with people that live in Victory that have their character molded through the things that they go through that they've come to the place where they don't let the devil Rob them of their Victory if you're happy tonight W Glory watch out tomorrow the devil will try to rob you of that Joy if you've got peace in your heart watch out tomorrow the devil try to take that from you he's got all kinds of traps set out there oh my that's right very very dangerous traps out there he's got set for everybody that's right but by God's Grace and by his Mercy we want to be the kind of people that he had intended for us to be and that's why he said as many as I love I rebuke and I chasen be zealous therefore and repent because you were born in sin shaped in iniquity you were born FAL Fallen but I'm going to take you from your Fallen State and take you out of that Fallen State and make you as righteous as God himself is righteous the devil was perfect and evil come into him all the Bible says is something I wish I would had the exact words I should shouldn't say it but something about evil was found in his heart and that right evil was found in him and what did the devil say I want to be like the most high I will Ascend above the clouds I will be like the most high he wanted to be worshiped like God was a selfish motive he had a selfish motive Lord help us God's going to take people that were junk trash deluded filthy dirty ain't that right Fallen and he picks them up cleans them up trains them because when we get over there brother when we get over there we're going to stick by his side a't that right all right a little more is that okay we got one more battle I want to show you that we're going to face even after wait a minute all right yes yes okay I thought I thought I had told you wrong but I didn't because Revelations 21 is where that Temple and all that is that is after the Thousand Years I looked here and I said see well here's the Thousand Years but no we come back in the 19th Chapter okay and we take this Beast isin't that right and the kings of the earth and their armies I don't want to keep you too long but how many know we're going to deal with these kingdoms hello you and I are going to deal with these kingdoms China America Russia all of these evil people we're going to deal with them can you imagine on the internet some of them hear it what that to bit to before preaching over there at evenight Tabernacle he things he going to deal with us yeah go ahead and laugh it ain't my word buddy it's his word try to keep that from coming to pass will you I'll see you there bud I will see you there that's right that's according to the word we're g we're gonna come back how many BL we're going to take this place over by the same Holy Spirit by the same power that cast The Devil out of us that come that you know we weren't treating our wife right or this that or the other and made us treat our wife right made us live right by that same power we're going to straighten this world up amen Christ us with Christ because we're joined HS amen we're joined HS with Christ amen they haven't seen the last of us that's right my all right and then after the Armageddon all right after Armageddon because remember Armageddon is on this side of the Millennium geog and Magog is on the other side so after this in chapter 20 of Revelations I saw another Angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the Dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years amen cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up amen over in Isaiah 14 he says and they shall narrowly look upon thee and say is this the guy that made that broke the Nations that caused the Nations to tremble is this the guy that did it how many knows the Devil is a person he's little imps he's got millions of little imps Little Devils that's right but one of these days we going to see him we're going to say is that the guy cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and put a seal on him he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be finished after that he is going to be loosen for a little little season and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image and had not received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and ruled or reigned for a thousand years how's getting ready to rule that's right they ruled and they reigned for a thousand years Jesus said if you were faithful in a little I'm going to make you Faithful in a lot for a thousand years and the rest of the Dead live not until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection how many knows if you aren't saved if you don't come up in that first resurrection you are going to be caught in a nightmare can't go up can't go down you're living in a nightmare brother bam explained it as for a thousand years I can't imagine brother Austin of those that were like Cain and all those that have been in their nightmare for 6,000 years that's right blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death has no power Hallelujah but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him for a thousand years yes we are getting ready to rule But first you got to rule yourself you got to rule your emotions you got to rule your feelings you got to rule your mind you got to have control of yourself amen and anything else is giving you to rule well over amen all right this is what I want to get to and when the thousand years are expired I got some bad news for us tonight Satan shall be loosed out of his prison ah so we got another guy coming back old slot old Devil's gonna come back come on folks say that's all right we whooped him once we'll whoop him again that's right if you got joy of the Holy Ghost in your heart night you had to whoop the devil to get that and to keep it you got to beat him every day just to keep it we're used to kicking him around we're used to kicking him out casting him out Under The Souls of your feet is that right why because we realize it's not us it's him in US greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Thomas B's long gone you're long gone it's Christ in you tonight it's the Holy Ghost in you tonight living wo it ain't hard for us to worship it ain't hard for us to scream and H and say thank you Lord why cuz it's God in us loosed out of his prison and shall go out and deceive the Nations now you remember what I said the vocabulary of our mind you better just keep it wide open this thing's bigger than what we think we have no idea really what it's going to be all we do know is that we got to be surrendered vessels to him because he has led us so far he's going to lead us through all of that amen he goes out and deceives the Nations amen which are in the four quarters of the earth sounds like they're everywhere right Gog and MOG to gather them together to battle Glory how many know we're used to battle we know what battle is we're not afraid of battle we battle all the time every day you battle when you get up you battle the middle of the day you battle and you overcome amen the number of whom is as the sand of the sea so yes it's G to be a big group it's G to be a large bunch of people as the sand of the sea wow amen and he go rose up and he they Compass the Earth the breadth of the earth Compass the camp of the Saints about that beloved City and Fire come down from God out of heaven and devoured them hello how many knows we read the back of the book we already know what going to happen Glory Hallelujah how many sees themselves in the city with God tonight I don't see myself out in those Nations being deceived he can't deceive me here he won't deceive me there I'll be with almighty God just who all that is I don't know amen but I do know they'll Compass to come up against God perhaps we'll tap you Jes is on the shoulder Papa guess what there's a army coming up again huh there's another Army coming up we need you to come on out here and do what you do best let that sharp sword come out of your mouth we know that if you speak something it's G to happen how many believes that we watched it happened when we took your word into our hearts and it happened we know that all man's words is lie but his is true so we know when you open your mouth amen and fire comes down and devoured them and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever amen and then comes let's just finish the book shall we and I saw a great white Throne after all of this forever and ever I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away and there was found no place for them and I sought a dead small and great I wish this would Echo all through the White House I wish this would echo in Russia and China and everywhere ain't that right saw a great white throne and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written therein according to their Works amen remember what brother Braham said on that white Throne judgment what you did will be played on Box Car size letters it'll be on the big screen that would be fair to say it's going to be put on the big screen everything you ever did every motion that you ever made every thought that ever went through your mind from the time that you became come to the age of accountability all the way till the day that you die that's why I say I can't imagine how long judgment will be brother Joe can you imagine everybody from Cain all the way all the way through everybody all of those people have to be judged according to all that they did amen and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire amen let's stand tonight bow our heads Lord
