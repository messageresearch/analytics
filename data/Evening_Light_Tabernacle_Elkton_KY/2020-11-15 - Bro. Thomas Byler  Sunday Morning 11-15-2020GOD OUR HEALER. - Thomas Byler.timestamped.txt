[45:31] Parish amen get to see him this morning
[45:33] been what be here praise the lord it's
[45:37] better to be
[45:38] here than it is to be somewhere
[45:41] else because I kind of had to argue with
[45:44] the devil this morning and get ready to
[45:47] come and I've been wanting to come back
[45:49] and see you good people for quite a
[45:53] while but being my age I was kind of
[45:56] afraid to get out out there in this uh
[45:59] world today that you know it's it's
[46:02] really in bad shape yes it is you know I
[46:05] believe we were we were looking at the
[46:07] day how many have remember brother Billy
[46:10] Paul asking brother brandham said what
[46:12] Dad tell me what's end's going to
[46:15] be and he spoke back and said son I
[46:19] can't tell you because you'd worry
[46:22] yourself to
[46:23] death now Billy Paul and I were close
[46:26] friends and we he come to my shop and I
[46:28] lived in Jeffersonville a long time when
[46:30] they was in while he'd go up there and
[46:33] and Ro us for a while but you
[46:37] know this message we all need to get
[46:41] really in this message and get in the
[46:43] word of God now then how many in here
[46:46] knows how to get closer to God Amen
[46:49] brother bam said pray and study yeah
[46:54] that he get you
[46:55] close and I believe that that's what
[46:58] I've been doing praying and
[47:00] studying and also to go to church a
[47:03] little bit I've got ever I've got 1,200
[47:06] messages of brother Brown I'm on my
[47:08] computer you know what I do every day
[47:12] listen to some of those
[47:13] messages and I believe this is the way
[47:17] the truth and the life and I believe we
[47:20] got a man here that's is way than the
[47:23] truth and the life and I pray for him I
[47:26] said God give him a message that we need
[47:29] to hear it may be rough but I like I'm
[47:32] rough do you like I'm rough I do I
[47:37] wanted to get down and hit me amen and
[47:40] straighten me out praise God
[47:43] [Applause]
[47:57] all right come
[47:58] on Amen we always like to hear from our
[48:02] family amen from far off amen so it's
[48:04] always good to hear so God bless you
[48:06] brother Steve good to have you and your
[48:07] family with us this weekend
[48:10] Amen brother yes God bless God bless
[48:16] you well God bless you Saints it's one
[48:19] of the things I do not like about
[48:21] visiting
[48:22] churches because I've always get put on
[48:24] the spot
[48:27] not that I'm a preacher or anything but
[48:29] for some reason I think uh God God has a
[48:32] sense of humor
[48:34] right just about everywhere I go be I I
[48:37] go to Mexico sometimes and and uh I get
[48:40] put on the spot so this morning I I knew
[48:44] I was going to be put on the spot so I
[48:46] did have a little something uh for you
[48:50] guys I do not want to take our brother's
[48:52] time um you know brother brand said
[48:57] um no service is
[49:01] complete without the word of God so I
[49:05] was
[49:06] thinking if you don't mind I read you a
[49:09] scripture
[49:12] so yeah the scripture I was thinking
[49:14] about this morning was in
[49:17] um the first book of
[49:20] John and the scripture says in the first
[49:23] book of John chapter 1 verse
[49:28] 7 it says but if we walk in the light as
[49:32] he is in the light we have
[49:35] Fellowship one with
[49:38] another in the blood of Jesus Christ his
[49:41] son cleanses us from all
[49:44] sin isn't that a precious
[49:47] scripture and you know
[49:51] today um so many people are are in
[49:56] church today just like we are but you
[49:59] know they're serving a bloodless
[50:03] religion you realize that they really
[50:05] are I'm not saying anything against
[50:07] those those folks they're wonderful
[50:08] people a lot of those people are are
[50:10] better people than we are
[50:12] even but they're got a bloodless
[50:15] religion because the denominational
[50:18] system has taken the blood out of this
[50:22] Bible and so they're giving the people
[50:25] they're giving their people a hybrid
[50:27] food but we're so thankful
[50:29] today that we had uh we had a a
[50:33] messenger who brought us food but it was
[50:37] not only food for his season when he was
[50:41] alive but you remember there's a
[50:44] storehouse and the Lord told
[50:47] them uh to to put that food in there
[50:50] because there was a time
[50:51] coming and so it is
[50:54] today it is today
[50:57] and uh you know I was thinking uh for me
[51:00] for well for us but especially for me uh
[51:04] we always take things for
[51:06] granted and uh I want to bring your
[51:10] greetings from uh from from our
[51:14] congregation brother bisco's church and
[51:17] um one time I went somewhere and they
[51:20] didn't give me greetings to give the
[51:22] people but I greeted the people anyway
[51:26] so when I came back I spoke to a brother
[51:28] a minister brother and I said well I
[51:30] didn't have greetings for the people I
[51:33] said but I gave the greetings anyway as
[51:35] if they had given me greetings and he
[51:37] said that's the way it is so the so I
[51:40] give you I I bring you greetings from
[51:42] the congregation in Canada because I'm
[51:45] sure if I said will you send your
[51:47] greetings to them they would say
[51:49] absolutely
[51:50] 100% uh so we we love your church over
[51:54] there we have heard about you we have
[51:56] heard about you and we have heard good
[51:59] things um you know I was thinking
[52:04] um uh we're staying with Brother John
[52:07] and sister Alicia and we have been we we
[52:10] felt so welcome being in their home we
[52:13] we really appreciate um you know their
[52:16] family and brother B said that the
[52:19] congregation is a is the reflection of
[52:21] the pastor let's just others do it and
[52:24] then he also said you know you can't you
[52:26] can't live higher than your pastor so
[52:29] those are those are things that are that
[52:30] are set in stone
[52:32] right and anyway we was out uh the other
[52:37] day we went to
[52:39] see uh they have the little boy Jonathan
[52:43] with him and um I was we went to see his
[52:48] uh Grandpa and his grandma who lived I
[52:50] don't know an hour away or something
[52:52] like that
[52:54] um and anyway Gary that's right and
[52:57] sister Marlene so when we were over
[53:00] there um uh I've learned this I've
[53:03] actually learned this from my pastor
[53:05] years and years ago he really likes to
[53:08] watch your
[53:09] children and so when we were there I was
[53:12] I was watching I was really observing
[53:15] Jonathan and it came to me uh really
[53:19] clear why the Lord said we have to be
[53:22] like little children because I I had I I
[53:25] kind of knew that already but I had
[53:27] wondered why is it that the Lord would
[53:29] take a little child and and say unless
[53:32] you're like these little
[53:35] children you're not going to enter there
[53:38] and you know when we got there he was
[53:41] happy to see Grandpa and Grandma but all
[53:43] of a sudden they had a gift for
[53:46] him and let me tell you as soon as they
[53:50] that he got a hold of that little gift
[53:52] and then they told him there was another
[53:54] one coming that's what spoke to me
[53:56] because when he heard there was another
[53:58] gift coming he didn't care who was there
[54:01] he didn't care about the food he didn't
[54:03] want to eat he he was just he was
[54:05] talking he was saying I got another gift
[54:07] coming and I got one more coming they're
[54:10] gonna give me one more well you know
[54:13] when I came this morning to to the
[54:15] church
[54:16] here I was thinking well if I got to be
[54:20] like a child like the Lord said but then
[54:23] I got to be expecting what gift is he
[54:26] going to give me
[54:27] today so I I've come this morning
[54:31] expecting that God is going to speak to
[54:33] me through his
[54:35] gift because I have needs in my life
[54:37] just like we all do you know I I have
[54:41] needs in my life that you know I'm
[54:43] looking for God to to answer me some
[54:50] prayers looking for God to move in some
[54:54] situations in our lives
[54:57] but I do
[54:59] believe that God can speak through the
[55:02] gift this morning and he can answer that
[55:05] so that's the gift I'm looking for just
[55:07] like Jonathan he was excited you should
[55:09] have seen him he just kept saying
[55:12] there's another gift coming this
[55:14] afternoon before you guys get here
[55:16] they're going to give me another gift
[55:18] and when we ask them Hey where's your
[55:20] little gift I mean he rushed to get it
[55:22] he was like right here this is what they
[55:23] gave me right now well I'm looking
[55:27] forward to the same I want to be like I
[55:28] want to be like a little child in that
[55:30] way that I want to be an expectation for
[55:32] what God is going to give to me I will
[55:35] make I I'll make an uh one uh another
[55:39] comment real quick before I go sit down
[55:43] um you know I was saying we take things
[55:46] for granted and I had always had I
[55:49] didn't know how it was going to take
[55:51] place but had I had always wanted to
[55:52] come to
[55:54] Kentucky and the reason being is because
[55:57] uh Kentucky I was telling I was telling
[56:00] somebody might have been my wife I said
[56:04] kentucki has a real uh special place I
[56:08] believe in the United States now and I
[56:11] tell you why this is this is my thing
[56:14] okay so when you talk about the Civil
[56:18] War that's a there's a lot of history
[56:20] here behind that Lots but then you have
[56:25] of course Abraham Lincoln who was from
[56:28] the land here but then as if that was
[56:32] not
[56:33] enough we have uh the prophet of God who
[56:37] who came from these lands so you think
[56:40] about the special place this place must
[56:43] have had in God's heart because he gave
[56:48] he gave this place Abraham Lincoln and
[56:52] then he gave this
[56:54] place uh the prophet of God who was born
[56:58] in in the area here somewhere around
[57:01] here so that's super special to me and
[57:05] then brother Brandon one
[57:07] time I remember when he talked I'm just
[57:09] going to paraphrase I don't have the
[57:11] quote with me but he brother Brandon was
[57:14] talking about uh when God spoke to him
[57:18] and go well God was speaking to
[57:21] David and he said I I given you a place
[57:25] with the Great of the
[57:27] earth and then brother Brandon was in
[57:30] that moment you can hear in the tape he
[57:32] gets overcome by
[57:33] emotion because then all of a sudden he
[57:36] can see and God said the same thing to
[57:39] him and then he said look at my paast he
[57:42] said look at look at where I come from
[57:44] and he start he started speaking about
[57:47] his childhood and all of that but then
[57:50] when he's when when he's done talking
[57:52] about that he said now look at me today
[57:54] he said I have to hide from people he
[57:58] said I have to hide he said because
[57:59] there's so many people that want to see
[58:01] me in the hi him right there that God
[58:04] had given them a place amongst the Great
[58:06] Men of the earth and it never hit me it
[58:09] never hit me until until today what was
[58:13] he talking about you know and I was
[58:16] thinking who was Abraham
[58:18] Lincoln right like you know if I go
[58:22] somewhere if I go somewhere I hope he
[58:25] doesn't hear this if I go somewhere all
[58:27] I have to say is I'm Andrew rias's dad
[58:31] and people say oh oh okay because I that
[58:35] I had that happen to me left o over and
[58:38] over I met some people from South
[58:40] America like P um way out there in the
[58:43] middle of nowhere and when I introduced
[58:46] myself they were going no okay I told
[58:48] them I said oh I said my son is Andrew
[58:50] Ras he sings at the church and they're
[58:52] like oh and anyway they knew who I was
[58:55] you know I was thinking about you you
[58:57] people you know all you have to say is
[58:59] you're from Kentucky and or you know the
[59:02] Land of Lincoln right and let me tell
[59:05] you the whole world would know where you
[59:07] come from right that's that's the way it
[59:11] is so anyway I'm really glad that I'm
[59:13] associated with the Lord Jesus
[59:15] Christ and really thankful and happy
[59:19] that we're here this morning you know

[1:03:42] praise the Lord I probably won't preach
[1:03:45] in Dutch but we'll preach in English we
[1:03:49] we could a little I've heard so much of
[1:03:50] it when I was young I can still repeat a
[1:03:53] large portion of it amen but anyway way
[1:03:57] so we just uh greet you in the name of
[1:03:59] the Lord and amen and welcome everybody
[1:04:02] this morning
[1:04:03] amen and
[1:04:05] so we are certainly praying that the
[1:04:07] Lord will just continue to watch over us
[1:04:09] remember this coming Wednesday now
[1:04:11] everybody can possibly make it amen
[1:04:14] there'll be brother Ted padle we're
[1:04:15] gonna have a good preacher Wednesday
[1:04:16] night amen how many enjoys this ministry
[1:04:19] brother Ted badley from Arizona is going
[1:04:21] to be with us Wednesday night and then
[1:04:23] brother Paul Hart next Sunday Amen
[1:04:26] brother Paul Hart will be with us next
[1:04:28] Sunday so remember him he's from Indiana
[1:04:31] amen from Brother DWI so we just pray
[1:04:33] that for that the Lord will bless him
[1:04:36] also amen we've been speaking on
[1:04:38] basically the attributes of God God and
[1:04:41] His attributes and who he is and what he
[1:04:43] is amen uh we've been touching a little
[1:04:46] bit on the just this morning we want to
[1:04:48] touch a little bit on the seven compound
[1:04:51] Redemptive names of Jehovah amen the
[1:04:54] seven different redemp names one of his
[1:04:56] Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah RI and many
[1:05:00] different ones that he has and so we've
[1:05:03] been basically the thought the direction
[1:05:06] that we've been going is speaking on God
[1:05:08] Amen and what he is and what he does for
[1:05:11] us amen because he's certainly one that
[1:05:13] is worth bragging about isn't he amen I
[1:05:16] believe the prophet of God one time amen
[1:05:18] was uh confronted by a woman who said
[1:05:21] you know you just brag on Jesus too much
[1:05:25] you know your only your fault the fault
[1:05:27] that you have is that you brag on Jesus
[1:05:30] too much and he says well thank you very
[1:05:32] much I'm very appreciate of that that's
[1:05:34] a wonderful fault to have amen is to
[1:05:37] brag about Jesus too much because
[1:05:39] there's not a whole lot in this world
[1:05:40] that we can brag about but the one thing
[1:05:43] we can
[1:05:45] do is Brag perhaps or just a prophit or
[1:05:49] something you know amen and that he
[1:05:51] wasn't Divine and so forth because of uh
[1:05:55] uh you know the fact that he cried and
[1:05:58] so he says I'll prove to you by your
[1:05:59] Bible that Jesus was just a man and and
[1:06:02] so forth and he says well I don't really
[1:06:05] believe that but if you can prove it she
[1:06:07] says well I believe in scripture says
[1:06:09] that Jesus wept wept like a
[1:06:13] man he says lady that is thinner than
[1:06:15] the broth of a chicken no that is
[1:06:19] thinner than the broth of a the shadow
[1:06:22] of a chicken that was starved to death
[1:06:25] now no it wasn't a chicken you might get
[1:06:26] a little broth out it but the shadow of
[1:06:28] a chicken you you don't get nothing out
[1:06:30] of the shadow of a chicken amen that was
[1:06:33] starve to death he says yes that's right
[1:06:35] lady he was a man when he cried and when
[1:06:37] he up over Jerusalem but he was a
[1:06:39] certainly more than a man when he told
[1:06:41] Lazarus come forth and the man came out
[1:06:43] of the Grave he was more than a man
[1:06:46] there you know in many places he was
[1:06:48] more than a man and so amen the Bible
[1:06:50] talks about how that God is all and he
[1:06:53] is in all amen how many believes that
[1:06:56] nothing's out of cater God knew exactly
[1:06:58] this world would be IND the condition
[1:06:59] condition that it's in amen and so it's
[1:07:02] moving forward right along right
[1:07:04] according to his program this morning uh
[1:07:07] amen I believe Wednesday night we talked
[1:07:09] about God is our deliverer amen amen and
[1:07:13] we took David and Goliath when he faced
[1:07:16] Goliath and so forth and and when he
[1:07:18] talked to Saul when when David come
[1:07:20] before Saul uh he told Saul he says you
[1:07:23] know I slew a i s i slew a lion I slew a
[1:07:28] bear he says and God will deliver this
[1:07:32] uncircumcised Philistine into my hand
[1:07:34] also amen and but he made sure to make
[1:07:37] help him to understand that it wasn't
[1:07:39] David that was the great man it was God
[1:07:41] that was going to do to delivering amen
[1:07:44] and when he talked to uh Goliath himself
[1:07:48] amen and the prophets were made about
[1:07:50] how that uh Goliath told David that he
[1:07:54] would feed his flesh to the foul in the
[1:07:55] air and so forth and what he would do
[1:07:57] and and pick him up perhaps with his
[1:07:59] Spear and whatnot and then David come he
[1:08:01] says you come to me with a sword and a
[1:08:03] shield but I come to you in the name of
[1:08:05] the Lord today I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
[1:08:07] going to feed you and the residue of the
[1:08:10] Philistines to the fouls of the air to
[1:08:12] the beasts of the field because this day
[1:08:14] God will deliver you into my hand I like
[1:08:18] that don't you he put the right emphasis
[1:08:20] on the fact that it was God that does it
[1:08:23] and that's what it's all about folks
[1:08:25] it's what God does Amen so we're
[1:08:28] wonderful we're so grateful what God has
[1:08:30] done in this generation amen because
[1:08:32] I'll tell you now I when I was uh uh
[1:08:35] left left a menites I was on my own
[1:08:37] about 16 years old when I went out there
[1:08:39] and be a masonary job and went out there
[1:08:41] in the world and and just lived however
[1:08:44] I want to did everything that I could
[1:08:45] and some things that I couldn't and
[1:08:47] found out that there's no real pleasure
[1:08:49] out there in the world Amen and begin to
[1:08:52] search and find out find out what what
[1:08:54] is Truth where is is the truth where do
[1:08:56] I go what do I believe and begin to
[1:08:58] testing different churches begin to
[1:09:00] testing different people and find you
[1:09:02] know that uh find out that each one has
[1:09:04] their own set of rules they all have a
[1:09:06] different way of seeing it then I was
[1:09:08] introduced to the prophet of God in this
[1:09:10] generation I TR to tell you one thing
[1:09:12] right now God has come down in this
[1:09:14] generation and he has proved himself
[1:09:16] alive and real unlike in any other time
[1:09:19] and age I believe with all my heart and
[1:09:21] he kept those tapes in store so that you
[1:09:24] could listen those tapes amen you could
[1:09:25] feed on the word of God and you can know
[1:09:27] that Jus Christ is alive he's the only
[1:09:30] way he's the only life he's the only
[1:09:32] truth there is no other way other than
[1:09:34] him anden I'm glad for God's grace this
[1:09:37] morning so this morning I want to talk
[1:09:39] to you not about God our deliverer but I
[1:09:41] want to talk to you about God being our
[1:09:43] healer amen amen god Jehovah REI amen
[1:09:48] amen Jehovah rifa amen God our healer so
[1:09:52] if you will with stand with me this
[1:09:53] morning we'll get into the word of God
[1:09:57] and let's just bow our heads this
[1:09:59] morning before we open the word just
[1:10:02] talk to the author this morning Lord
[1:10:04] Jesus we come before you Lord Jesus
[1:10:06] thankful God that we can have the right
[1:10:09] Lord Jesus by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:11] to approach your throne of grace this
[1:10:13] morning and we desire father that you
[1:10:15] would just help me Lord to get out of
[1:10:16] the way Lord we know that you gave the
[1:10:18] church five five gifts Lord the fivefold
[1:10:21] ministry of that's in the church God and
[1:10:24] Lord you have placed a gift I believe
[1:10:25] truly in my heart father and if I can
[1:10:28] just get myself out of the way Lord then
[1:10:30] you can use that gift to speak to your
[1:10:32] people the things that that you want to
[1:10:34] say father if I was to not get out of
[1:10:36] the way Lord then I might say things
[1:10:38] that are damaging things that you don't
[1:10:40] want said Lord and mess it all up but
[1:10:43] father so I ask God that you just help
[1:10:44] me as I surrender to you Lord this
[1:10:46] morning have your way in the
[1:10:48] service Lord we thank you
[1:10:51] Lord Jesus for every face that we see we
[1:10:53] know that God the people love you Lord
[1:10:55] Jesus and they love to come into the
[1:10:57] house of God to worship you in spirit
[1:10:59] and in truth and Lord we truly believe
[1:11:01] that we're living in the end time God
[1:11:03] when it's fixing to be all over with
[1:11:05] Lord and we going to come to disguise to
[1:11:07] meet you in the air and Lord we're here
[1:11:09] to prepare ourselves we're here to be
[1:11:10] ready for that time father for you we
[1:11:13] know that the Great Tribulation lays
[1:11:15] just beyond the
[1:11:17] Rapture father and those that are left
[1:11:19] out there will be there'll be weeping
[1:11:21] and wailing and nashing of
[1:11:22] teeth and Lord we have no intentions to
[1:11:25] be here at that time father and so we
[1:11:27] feel in our hearts God there's something
[1:11:28] pulling us something causing us to come
[1:11:31] subject to the word Lord a Earnest of
[1:11:34] our Redemption Lord is taking place in
[1:11:36] every heart father we're all searching
[1:11:37] ourselves asking ourselves if we're in
[1:11:40] the faith or not asking ourselves if we
[1:11:42] are in the place that we should be or
[1:11:44] not Lord and how if we are not that how
[1:11:46] that we can get ready and how that we
[1:11:48] can make things right and do things
[1:11:50] that's right Lord Jesus we just ask God
[1:11:52] that Lord I feel you've played this upon
[1:11:54] my heart to speak we ask God your
[1:11:56] blessing upon it now in Jesus Christ's
[1:11:58] name bless your word this morning amen
[1:12:02] and amen turn to Malachi 4 amen first
[1:12:06] Malachi
[1:12:19] 4 verse
[1:12:21] one for behold the day cometh that shall
[1:12:25] burn as an oven and all the proud
[1:12:29] Y and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:12:34] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[1:12:36] burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts
[1:12:39] and it shall leave them neither root nor
[1:12:42] Branch how many beli there's a fire
[1:12:44] coming Peter said the heavens shall be
[1:12:47] on fire and the elements shall melt with
[1:12:48] fervent heat all all the things of the
[1:12:52] Earth are going to be burnt up in that
[1:12:54] day remember the day cometh the day of
[1:12:56] the Lord cometh at the thief in the
[1:12:58] night in wherein the heavens will be on
[1:13:00] fire and so forth it's going to be the
[1:13:02] day it's going to God's going to have
[1:13:03] his day man has his day now to do what
[1:13:06] they want to and however they want to
[1:13:08] but God's going to have his
[1:13:09] day but I like this notice it'll leave
[1:13:12] them neither brute nor Branch but it
[1:13:14] talks about a different category of
[1:13:16] people here don't it IT addresses
[1:13:19] another group there's going to be a
[1:13:22] group but unto you hey amen can you put
[1:13:26] your name there this morning but unto
[1:13:29] you that fear or reverence my name shall
[1:13:33] the son of righteousness arise with
[1:13:38] healing in his wings and ye shall go
[1:13:43] forth and grow up as calves of the stall
[1:13:46] and ye shall
[1:13:47] tread down the wicked and they shall be
[1:13:51] ashes Under The Souls of the your feet
[1:13:54] in the the day that I shall do this
[1:13:56] sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the
[1:13:58] law of Moses my servant which I
[1:14:00] commanded unto him in Horeb and in all
[1:14:01] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[1:14:04] now notice now here's a prophecy for our
[1:14:06] day behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:14:10] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:14:13] and Dreadful day of the Lord how many
[1:14:15] knows there has got to be a Prophet come
[1:14:18] on the scene be before it burns up and
[1:14:22] we've had that prophet he has done come
[1:14:25] and he has unone the next thing that's
[1:14:27] left is the fire amen and he shall turn
[1:14:31] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:14:32] children and the hearts of the children
[1:14:34] to the fathers least I come and smite
[1:14:37] the Earth with a curse may God add His
[1:14:39] blessings to the reading a word you can
[1:14:41] be seated this morning so this morning
[1:14:42] with the help of the Lord I want to deal
[1:14:45] perhaps with the healing of almighty God
[1:14:48] first of all when we talk about God and
[1:14:50] when we talk about his being a deliverer
[1:14:52] and let me just uh perhaps if I could I
[1:14:55] I'm going to just read you the seven
[1:14:56] compound Redemptive names of God and
[1:14:59] what it means and of course you know we
[1:15:01] could take a sermon on each one of these
[1:15:03] and we won't but we want to deal with
[1:15:05] the the second one Jehovah Raa amen now
[1:15:08] notice Jehovah Gyra means that the Lord
[1:15:12] will provide amen how many that God is
[1:15:16] the provider the Bible says that there
[1:15:18] was not anything that was made that was
[1:15:20] nothing was made but what he made amen
[1:15:23] so whatever amen God is made he provides
[1:15:26] all for us we won't go down there too
[1:15:28] far but he's our provider the next is I
[1:15:31] am the Lord that Health
[1:15:34] thee amen I am the Lord that Health thee
[1:15:37] and that's what we want to dwell on this
[1:15:39] morning uh Jehovah nassi the Lord is my
[1:15:45] banner je Jehovah Shalom he says uh the
[1:15:50] Lord is
[1:15:52] peace amen the Lord is peace peace the
[1:15:55] Lord's peace and R O the Lord is my
[1:16:00] shepherd amen how many know that he is
[1:16:03] truly The Shepherd of the
[1:16:05] Sheep amen and I want you to remember
[1:16:08] that all of these things were in God
[1:16:11] before he ever even created the world
[1:16:13] and we know he could never express being
[1:16:15] a shepherd He could never express being
[1:16:18] a savior he could never
[1:16:20] express being a redeemer he could never
[1:16:23] express being a war unless he allowed
[1:16:26] the world to get into the condition that
[1:16:28] it is amen and you and I are receiving
[1:16:31] and and and being edified and receiving
[1:16:34] the blessings of what the essence of
[1:16:36] almighty God really is amen now we know
[1:16:39] that the prophet taught us that we are
[1:16:41] living way below our god-given
[1:16:44] privileges isn't that right amen and
[1:16:47] also he says you know that every promise
[1:16:50] in the Bible when you have become a Son
[1:16:52] of God when you receive the baptism of
[1:16:54] the Holy ghost every promise is yours
[1:16:57] whatsoever you desire whatsoever you
[1:16:59] think ask you ask you shall receive ask
[1:17:03] and you shall receive how many believe
[1:17:05] that and so we have the we have the the
[1:17:09] checkbook so to speak we have the
[1:17:11] authority amen that is all belongs to us
[1:17:14] but there was a reason that our prophets
[1:17:15] that the church and the people are
[1:17:17] living way down below what they should
[1:17:20] be living and that's what we're going to
[1:17:22] kind of focus on this morning would that
[1:17:23] be okay because I truly believe that as
[1:17:26] we get closer to the Rapture and I don't
[1:17:27] know about you but I'll tell you what
[1:17:29] every day it's just something I don't
[1:17:31] know what it is I'm not here to say may
[1:17:34] say yay or n but I'm telling you right
[1:17:35] now there's something down in my soul
[1:17:39] I'm I'm feeling something fixing to
[1:17:42] happen how I don't know about you but I
[1:17:44] can just sense there's something fixing
[1:17:46] to happen it's right at the
[1:17:49] threshold now not everybody has that
[1:17:51] fear not everybody has that reverence
[1:17:53] not everybody has that feeling but I
[1:17:55] believe the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:57] that the people of God are going to have
[1:17:59] it in their soul they're going to sense
[1:18:01] something that there's danger really
[1:18:04] close amen and that danger is that you
[1:18:07] would miss the Rapture that you would
[1:18:09] not go into translation and that you
[1:18:11] would have to be left here in the Great
[1:18:13] Tribulation period and we see America is
[1:18:16] certainly
[1:18:18] ripe for Uprising they are ripe for all
[1:18:23] kinds of Chaos
[1:18:27] the world is ripe for chaos they're on
[1:18:30] the verge of chaos the whole world get
[1:18:34] ready for it but just something I don't
[1:18:36] know what it is but I just feel like
[1:18:38] it's time for the bride to get ready and
[1:18:40] I feel the Lord at least in my life and
[1:18:43] I trust it's in your life that he's
[1:18:45] working something he's doing something
[1:18:47] there's a pool that's going on that's
[1:18:50] pulling it to him saying there's a pull
[1:18:51] going on if you are his remember this if
[1:18:54] I lifted I will draw all men unto myself
[1:18:58] and especially his people are going to
[1:18:59] be pulled am me towards God and away
[1:19:02] from this world
[1:19:04] Amen the velcro the velcro of the world
[1:19:08] that we're velcro to is coming loose and
[1:19:11] the velro in our lives that ties us to
[1:19:13] God is coming together amen and it's
[1:19:16] tied and feeling it closer and closer
[1:19:19] how many's with me this morning you feel
[1:19:21] that
[1:19:22] pull amen and I believe that this is the
[1:19:25] this is what God is doing I don't know
[1:19:27] what he's doing in any your other
[1:19:28] churches I don't know but a lot of times
[1:19:30] you go online and a lot of times you'll
[1:19:31] see and you'll hear amen ministers going
[1:19:33] in the same direction saying the same
[1:19:35] thing I don't know but I believe that
[1:19:37] that's the way the Holy Spirit Works
[1:19:39] amen that he's getting his church ready
[1:19:41] to leave this world I truly believe that
[1:19:44] I didn't finish amen and then there's
[1:19:46] the U after the shepherd is I can't
[1:19:49] pronounce it TS i d n
[1:19:53] u all right and it means the Lord is our
[1:19:59] righteousness and the last one is
[1:20:01] Jehovah sh the Lord is
[1:20:06] there how many believe that I will never
[1:20:10] leave you nor forsake you even until the
[1:20:13] end of the world I am going to be
[1:20:18] there how many believes he's here how
[1:20:21] many believes our meeting is in vain if
[1:20:24] the Lord Jesus Christ isn't here if the
[1:20:27] Holy Spirit isn't here then we are
[1:20:29] meeting in
[1:20:30] vain amen me and my wife is driving out
[1:20:33] here coming to church we passed the
[1:20:35] Baptist Church over there and they were
[1:20:36] walking in there and I said honey they
[1:20:39] are walking into a
[1:20:43] morg now how many knows that's what the
[1:20:45] prophet of God called the
[1:20:48] morgs call them lodes he said they're
[1:20:51] dead that's where dead people go
[1:20:55] they don't have a real Ministry they
[1:20:56] don't they don't they don't call Sin out
[1:20:59] they don't have the blood there as our
[1:21:00] brother was saying the blood's not there
[1:21:03] it's a bloodless religion it's a dead
[1:21:07] religion where the Holy Ghost isn't it's
[1:21:11] dead amen there's churches that been
[1:21:13] dead for hundreds of years and they
[1:21:15] don't know
[1:21:17] it
[1:21:18] amen but I'm thankful to God I'm that
[1:21:22] he's still in his people yes in his
[1:21:25] church wherever that is whoever that is
[1:21:28] hey you could be in this church don't
[1:21:29] mean you're alive you could be dead
[1:21:31] sitting there it all depends on if you
[1:21:34] got Christ in it the Bible says he that
[1:21:36] hath the son hath life he that hath not
[1:21:39] the son hath not
[1:21:41] life
[1:21:43] amen praise the Lord so we look at that
[1:21:46] and we see this that it's truly the Lord
[1:21:49] it is truly the Lord that does healing
[1:21:52] now we know that uh down through
[1:21:55] different times and all the way back
[1:21:57] into Israel's time that how that that
[1:21:59] you know Jesus would heal the sick and
[1:22:01] he would raise the dead and he would all
[1:22:03] do all these things and they says you
[1:22:05] know you cast The Devil out by by
[1:22:08] Beba and Jesus said that don't make
[1:22:10] sense he says not if the devil cast out
[1:22:13] the devil his Kingdom's divided and it
[1:22:14] would fall no Devils can't cast out
[1:22:17] Devils that's not how it
[1:22:19] works no and listen and people want to
[1:22:22] try to say that the devil can heal let
[1:22:24] me me tell you something the devil can't
[1:22:25] heal
[1:22:27] anything God the devil he doesn't have
[1:22:30] the ability to heal how many times have
[1:22:32] you had a cut amen and all those uh
[1:22:36] cells and different things you know amen
[1:22:38] the cells the brother B says you know
[1:22:40] that when you have a cut amen and
[1:22:41] perhaps you get little puss going there
[1:22:43] he says those that puss is a bunch of
[1:22:45] little soldiers that have given their
[1:22:47] life fighting that bad germ to save your
[1:22:51] life you don't see a a cancer how many
[1:22:54] know cancer perhaps you have a cancer or
[1:22:56] something amen and those cancer cells
[1:22:58] they don't fight each other they build
[1:23:00] and build to destroy you to take your
[1:23:03] life because that devil doesn't come but
[1:23:05] to kill and to steal and to destroy
[1:23:08] that's all the Devil comes to
[1:23:10] do but God comes to heal it's the good
[1:23:14] cells that fight the bad cells not fight
[1:23:18] bad cells fighting bad cells it doesn't
[1:23:20] happen that way amen so now let me I
[1:23:23] want to ask you I want to be again uh
[1:23:25] with with something that caught my
[1:23:27] attention when I was listening to this

[1:23:33] here and I want to ask you a question
[1:23:34] you can raise your hand in a minute but
[1:23:36] this is kind of a test for all of us now
[1:23:38] how many Know believe that there's
[1:23:40] actually Divine
[1:23:41] Healing Divine Healing how many can say
[1:23:45] this morning that you have absolutely
[1:23:46] been miraculously healed by Divine
[1:23:52] Healing Divine Healing
[1:23:55] now I want to read you something else
[1:23:57] brother bam says all healing comes from
[1:24:01] God all all healing is Divine Healing
[1:24:09] now how many has had Divine
[1:24:11] Healing huh folk if you got sick and you
[1:24:15] got well you experience Divine
[1:24:19] Healing all healing comes from God why
[1:24:23] the scripture says um let me see
[1:24:26] here Psalms 1033 says I am the Lord who
[1:24:31] heals all thy
[1:24:35] diseases so oh my when I think about
[1:24:38] this and how that God is the he is the
[1:24:40] one that does all the healing there's no
[1:24:43] healing but what comes from God every
[1:24:46] time you have a cut every time you have
[1:24:49] a bruis whenever that gets better praise
[1:24:52] be to God you ought to thank God say
[1:24:54] thank than you Jesus every time you have
[1:24:56] a headache and that headache goes away
[1:24:58] that's Divine
[1:25:00] Healing every time you have a back haake
[1:25:02] and that back that's healed praise be to
[1:25:05] God I have been divinely healed hello
[1:25:09] how many pleas all healing and all
[1:25:11] healing that says is divine because it
[1:25:14] comes from
[1:25:16] God Amen I thought about brother Parish
[1:25:19] amen of how you're what 90 92 92 92 in
[1:25:24] May you H how many times this man has
[1:25:27] had to experience Divine Healing to get
[1:25:30] to 92 almost 91 isin't that right Divine
[1:25:33] Healing to think to get that far you
[1:25:35] have got to experience Divine Healing
[1:25:38] every time you get sick and you get a
[1:25:40] fever and I'll tell you what if it
[1:25:42] wasn't for the grace of God you would
[1:25:44] die you would never get any better but
[1:25:46] it's Divine Healing it's God that comes
[1:25:48] and heals you it is him that touches you
[1:25:51] and sometimes we just take that for
[1:25:52] granted we don't realize that it's
[1:25:54] almighty God that does it brother Steve
[1:25:56] I thought about you that and he's
[1:25:57] getting better isn't it wouldn't it be
[1:25:59] terrible if it got worse and worse and
[1:26:01] worse you'd have to get in a wheelchair
[1:26:04] but God it is Divine Healing that heals
[1:26:06] it all the doctors can do is sew it up
[1:26:10] or give you medicine but it's God that
[1:26:12] does the
[1:26:14] healing amen it's absolutely God that
[1:26:17] does the
[1:26:18] healing amen it has to be God praise the
[1:26:23] Lord and you know I don't want to talk
[1:26:25] to you about just natural healing but I
[1:26:27] want to talk to you about spiritual
[1:26:29] healing we know that through Malachi 4
[1:26:32] the prophet in this
[1:26:33] generation we've got the books back
[1:26:36] there and it has all the records of how
[1:26:39] that there would be in Africa ain't that
[1:26:42] right how many truckloads semi TR loads
[1:26:45] of Cs and stretchers ain't that right
[1:26:48] seven or 11 I forget the number of
[1:26:50] truckloads of cuts and stretchers and
[1:26:53] sticks where people had to have to prob
[1:26:55] get and that all those C and stretches
[1:26:57] loads of them where the Lord come down
[1:26:59] and just healed the whole congregation
[1:27:02] heal all of those people there was
[1:27:04] healing mass healing that took place in
[1:27:07] our generation unlike the time of Christ
[1:27:10] way more than Christ because he said
[1:27:12] more Works shall shall you do because I
[1:27:14] go unto the father greater than this
[1:27:16] shall you do more shall you do isin't
[1:27:19] that right and through this generation
[1:27:21] God came down when he came when that son
[1:27:23] came with righteousness with healing in
[1:27:26] his wings he took and healed the people
[1:27:28] is that right and people would flock
[1:27:30] from everywhere to get
[1:27:33] healed they would come from everywhere
[1:27:35] to get healed but when he came and he
[1:27:36] says denominational churches is
[1:27:39] absolutely The Mark of the
[1:27:41] Beast Boy that's when people left him oh
[1:27:44] no we can't handle that but yet God
[1:27:46] stayed with him God still kept proving
[1:27:49] that he was the truth it's absolutely
[1:27:51] according to the word of God Amen the
[1:27:54] Bible says that that white woman was a
[1:27:56] mother of harlots and Abominations of
[1:27:59] the earth and the kings of the earth
[1:28:01] committed fornication with her people
[1:28:03] claim to be married to Christ and live
[1:28:05] any any old way doing anything they want
[1:28:07] to nothing but adulterers spiritual
[1:28:12] adulterers dress anyway think anyway
[1:28:14] live there all no that's not
[1:28:17] Christ that's what it consists of out
[1:28:19] there but think about it came to for the
[1:28:21] healing and now listen how many know
[1:28:24] that natural healing is a
[1:28:27] minor amen you might be healed but think
[1:28:30] about every one of those in that
[1:28:32] generation for the most part are
[1:28:34] probably dead right now all
[1:28:37] gone unless they were just a child
[1:28:40] perhaps in the 1965 some of those could
[1:28:43] still be here but most of them were
[1:28:44] children barely even remember it but
[1:28:46] most of those people that got their
[1:28:48] healing amen that they have had to pass
[1:28:51] away but now how many know that
[1:28:54] you can't never major on a minor but the
[1:28:57] major healing that takes place the thing
[1:29:00] that he is really interested in is your
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:08] soul that's the thing that needs
[1:29:11] healing now I want to go to another
[1:29:13] scripture if you would let's go over to
[1:29:16] the Book of
[1:29:18] Numbers Book of Numbers 21
[1:29:37] and we'll begin with verse five and go
[1:29:38] through nine and then I'll turn to St
[1:29:41] John 3:14 and
[1:29:43] 15 and his people spake against God and
[1:29:47] against Moses remember this is when they
[1:29:49] were going through the Wilderness and
[1:29:51] against Moses wherefore or have you
[1:29:55] brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
[1:29:59] wilderness for there is no bread neither
[1:30:02] is there any water and our soul loathes
[1:30:06] this light bread and the Lord sent fiery
[1:30:11] serpents among the people now how many
[1:30:14] know he could have chose frogs to bite
[1:30:15] them he could have chose anything to
[1:30:16] bite them but he chose serpents to bite
[1:30:20] him amen and the example here is that
[1:30:23] when you go to complaining against God
[1:30:25] remember you're getting snake bit death
[1:30:29] sits in on you when you get to
[1:30:31] complaining about what God is doing and
[1:30:34] about God's
[1:30:36] program amen God isn't pleased with it
[1:30:38] at all he sent fiery serpents among the
[1:30:42] people and they bit the people and much
[1:30:45] people of Israel died therefore the
[1:30:48] people came to Moses and said we have
[1:30:50] sinned for we have spoken against the
[1:30:52] Lord and against the
[1:30:54] pray unto the Lord and he he take away
[1:30:58] the serpents from us and Moses prayed
[1:31:01] for the people and the Lord said unto
[1:31:03] Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and set
[1:31:06] it upon a pole and it shall come to pass
[1:31:08] that everyone that is bitten when he
[1:31:11] lookth upon it shall live amen that's
[1:31:15] where the song comes look and live look
[1:31:17] and live amen look to Jesus Christ and
[1:31:20] live simply by looking at it and
[1:31:22] believing now I'm they had to believe
[1:31:26] but they made a serpent and now notice
[1:31:28] and Moses made a serpent of brass now
[1:31:31] how many knows that brass represents
[1:31:34] judgment yeah that's right he made a
[1:31:36] brass serpent in other words this
[1:31:38] serpent that had bit him they put him up
[1:31:40] on a pole right amen this serpent it
[1:31:44] represents this serpent having been
[1:31:47] judged right amen and put up on a pole
[1:31:51] now how many knows that Jesus became
[1:31:53] sinful for us is that right Jesus became
[1:31:56] sin for us amen and he was lifted up on
[1:31:59] the pole
[1:32:02] amen and put it upon a pole and it came
[1:32:05] to pass that if the serpent had bitten
[1:32:07] any man when he beheld The Serpent of
[1:32:10] brass that he lived over in St
[1:32:15] John
[1:32:16] 3 St John
[1:32:19] 3 and this is not just something I come
[1:32:22] up with or think about but this is what
[1:32:24] the scripture says and how many believes
[1:32:26] that's more important than anything St
[1:32:28] John 3 and verse4 now notice he says and
[1:32:32] as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:32:38] wilderness even so must the son be
[1:32:41] lifted up amen that whosoever believeth
[1:32:46] in him right looks upon Him should not
[1:32:51] perish but have eternal
[1:32:54] life amen so for God so Lov the world
[1:32:57] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:32:59] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:33:00] have perished but have
[1:33:03] everlasting
[1:33:05] life W praise the Lord think about if
[1:33:08] you can absolutely without question
[1:33:11] believe that scripture you can change
[1:33:13] your destination from going to hell to
[1:33:16] going to heaven whosoever believeth on
[1:33:20] him shall not perish but have
[1:33:22] everlasting life
[1:33:24] now I don't know about you but that's
[1:33:25] what I believe that changed me that's
[1:33:27] what I believe that got me the holy
[1:33:30] ghost that Jesus Christ is the Son of
[1:33:32] God that he was lifted up for me that he
[1:33:34] paid the price for my
[1:33:37] sins how many believes he paid the price
[1:33:39] he was the one that was lifted up he was
[1:33:41] judged by almighty God the wrath of
[1:33:44] almighty God come down upon Jesus on the
[1:33:46] cross and he paid for the sins of the
[1:33:48] whole world just like that fiery serpent
[1:33:51] he was a representation put that serpent
[1:33:53] at everybody that's been spit by the
[1:33:55] serpent I don't know about you but that
[1:33:57] serpent in the Garden of Eden how many
[1:33:59] knows we've all been bitten by that
[1:34:02] serpent amen that bite represents the
[1:34:06] bite of
[1:34:07] sin bitten by amen and you were going to
[1:34:11] die how many know you going to
[1:34:13] die amen because we have all been
[1:34:16] affected by the bite of The Serpent and
[1:34:18] we was going to die but he put up a pole
[1:34:20] amen it's not that serpent anymore but
[1:34:22] it's Christ that we look to because
[1:34:24] there's not any salvation in any other
[1:34:27] there's not a Salvation in this church
[1:34:29] or any other Church there is only
[1:34:31] salvation in Jesus Christ nowhere else
[1:34:35] not
[1:34:36] ever praise be to God oh Hallelujah
[1:34:40] think about that oh my so now notice
[1:34:43] here bam says as Jesus said as Moses
[1:34:46] lift up the serpent in the wilderness so
[1:34:48] must the son be lifted up now the same
[1:34:50] reason in the compound reason he was
[1:34:53] wounded
[1:34:54] for our transgressions and with his
[1:34:57] stripes we were
[1:34:59] healed oh they were murmured against God
[1:35:02] and against Moses and were bitten by
[1:35:03] serpents amen and the serpent tooken the
[1:35:07] care of a two-fold application TW
[1:35:09] twofold the first was to forgive their
[1:35:12] sins and to heal their
[1:35:14] sickness amen how many believes it was a
[1:35:17] twofold reason that he was lifted up one
[1:35:20] to take away the sin that we have and
[1:35:24] the other one was for our
[1:35:26] healing both natural I'll tell you right
[1:35:29] now that we have just as R right to the
[1:35:31] Holy Ghost to forgiveness and the
[1:35:33] healing of our soul as we do to the
[1:35:36] Natural part the healing of our
[1:35:38] bodies amen God was going to make a way
[1:35:41] for us Isaiah 4522 says we find God says
[1:35:45] look unto me all ye ends of the Earth
[1:35:48] amen now when the Earth has come to its
[1:35:51] end of its systems when that all comes
[1:35:53] hand let the people begin to look at him
[1:35:58] how many believes it's time to begin to
[1:35:59] look up for our Redemption Draw N time
[1:36:02] to focus our thoughts and our minds Amen
[1:36:06] on above not on the things
[1:36:08] below praise be to
[1:36:11] God
[1:36:12] Amen
[1:36:14] so praise be to
[1:36:17] God God is good isn't
[1:36:21] he so we know that God has to take away
[1:36:24] first of all we realize that whether
[1:36:27] it's spiritual or whether it's natural
[1:36:29] healing it all comes from God Amen and
[1:36:33] God was going to make God was going to
[1:36:36] make a remedy amen God was going to come
[1:36:38] up with a cure and today in today's
[1:36:41] world they're trying their best to come
[1:36:44] up with a cure they're coming up with a
[1:36:47] medicine they're kind of come up with
[1:36:48] something amen for this
[1:36:50] covid-19 and I'm not right they're
[1:36:53] calling it warp speed right they're
[1:36:56] looking for something at warp speed to
[1:36:59] try to take care of this covid-19 a
[1:37:02] sickness that they don't really know
[1:37:03] what to do with they claim they got it
[1:37:06] perhaps now and so forth but listen it
[1:37:08] was at warp feet they're trying to come
[1:37:09] up with something and can you imagine
[1:37:12] all the different things they tried all
[1:37:13] the things they tested and so forth and
[1:37:16] just like penicil how many knows when
[1:37:17] they come up with Penicillin amen they
[1:37:19] took care it was something that would
[1:37:21] kill bad bacteria
[1:37:23] amen and they found this they found it
[1:37:25] and they had to use this and they had to
[1:37:27] try that Amen to try to come up to find
[1:37:29] something that would counteract that and
[1:37:31] that's exactly what God did for you and
[1:37:34] me amen looking for a cure looking for
[1:37:38] something that will take care of your
[1:37:40] problem amen and then you know a lot of
[1:37:42] times you'll take uh before they try it
[1:37:45] on human trials who they try it on
[1:37:48] first a guinea pig or some kind of
[1:37:51] animal they'll try on animal see it
[1:37:53] works on them before they try humans and
[1:37:56] know and then when it works on the
[1:37:57] perhaps then they'll get a very brave
[1:38:00] human being to step in ain't that right
[1:38:02] and say all right who's brave enough to
[1:38:04] try this out somebody will volunteer you
[1:38:07] know perhaps they'll be famous or
[1:38:09] something and they'll try it on humans
[1:38:11] and they'll find out how many know that
[1:38:13] there certain things and the doctor when
[1:38:14] you go to the doctor's office he said
[1:38:16] now are you allergic to penicillin are
[1:38:18] you allergic to Tylenol are you allergic
[1:38:20] to aspirin or are you allergic to does
[1:38:22] this not work for because not all of
[1:38:25] these things that they come up with work
[1:38:27] for
[1:38:28] everybody they might work on some and it
[1:38:31] might want work on anothers but now how
[1:38:33] many knows the Salvation plan it works
[1:38:35] for everybody that comes to him and is
[1:38:38] willing to take this medicine you know
[1:38:40] how much of a tacle they have about
[1:38:42] people saying I'm not taking it I'm not
[1:38:44] taking it if Trump comes up with it I
[1:38:46] ain't taking
[1:38:48] it hey now that somebody else is in
[1:38:50] they'll probably take shots spot a dozen
[1:38:54] uh but listen you know it's all all all
[1:38:56] of that you know but think about it they
[1:38:58] have to come up with something that
[1:39:00] works something that is safe everybody
[1:39:03] wants something that's safe and that's
[1:39:05] what God did amen and we know that Jesus
[1:39:08] Christ so to speak amen he was the true
[1:39:11] test subject Christ was the subject of
[1:39:15] whether we had a toxin whether we had a
[1:39:18] medicine amen that would
[1:39:20] work now how many know the Bible said
[1:39:23] that Jesus Jesus Christ was tempted in
[1:39:25] every place in every way Jesus Christ
[1:39:27] was tempted like the Temptation that
[1:39:29] comes upon every one of
[1:39:32] us
[1:39:34] yet without sin that's right he was yet
[1:39:38] without sin he came to that place it
[1:39:40] didn't matter whenever the devil tempted
[1:39:42] him on the mountain says you know you're
[1:39:44] starved you haven't eaten for 40 days
[1:39:46] amen turn these stones into
[1:39:48] bread oh he was a hunger remember that
[1:39:51] that they left him but he got hungry
[1:39:54] and what did he do he tested him the
[1:39:55] devil got Eve he got Moses he got David
[1:39:58] he got all of these other brothers he
[1:40:00] got them to fall but when he come to
[1:40:01] this one and he tried to get him to fall
[1:40:03] he found out that it wasn't so
[1:40:07] easy no that's the prophet God said he
[1:40:09] had a he grabbed a hole of a 10,000 watt
[1:40:12] wire he got his feather
[1:40:14] singed amen Thou shalt not tempt the
[1:40:17] Lord thy
[1:40:19] God Amen another place he says Just Fall
[1:40:21] Down and Worship me and you can have all
[1:40:23] the kingdoms of the
[1:40:25] world offered all the kingdoms of the
[1:40:28] world he offered them Amica he offered

[1:40:34] all the kingdoms you can have all these
[1:40:36] kingdoms you can be the ruler of all of
[1:40:38] them in other words Satan offered Jesus
[1:40:43] to be his right-and
[1:40:46] man the only thing you have to do is to
[1:40:49] Fall Down and Worship
[1:40:51] me that's all devil wanted him to do he
[1:40:55] offered him all these things amen and he
[1:40:59] got another says Thou shalt Worship the
[1:41:01] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[1:41:05] serve no thank you how many knows when
[1:41:07] you rebuke the devil he'll flee from you
[1:41:10] he'll flee from you if you rebuke him
[1:41:13] amen he was tempted in all these
[1:41:15] different places he was tempted amen
[1:41:18] with women he was tempted with lust he
[1:41:20] was tempted with uh money he was tempted
[1:41:23] with popularity huh but he made himself
[1:41:26] of no reputation and became and took on
[1:41:29] the form of a serpent servant not
[1:41:32] serpent amen so how many believes that
[1:41:35] no matter what it was he passed every
[1:41:38] test when he comes down to one of the
[1:41:41] hardest tests from what I understand was
[1:41:43] in The Garden of Gethsemane when he knew
[1:41:45] that his hour was come say it was the
[1:41:48] hardest battle that he could ever face
[1:41:51] was having to go through being be spit
[1:41:53] on false accuse going to Calvary and
[1:41:55] suffering death itself going to death
[1:41:59] itself he was a human being he was a man
[1:42:01] he had these things here that he had to
[1:42:03] battle with and he had to pray to be
[1:42:05] able to have the strength to go through
[1:42:07] it at one place he was so strong and so
[1:42:10] powerful until he says father if it be
[1:42:13] possible huh almost a word that you
[1:42:16] wouldn't think Jesus would say but yet
[1:42:18] he said it he says father if it's
[1:42:20] possible let this cup pass from
[1:42:25] me if there's any way that I don't have
[1:42:28] to do
[1:42:29] this
[1:42:32] huh that was the fight the fight was
[1:42:35] between his will and the will of God how
[1:42:39] many knows that's going to be every one
[1:42:40] of our biggest fight between what you
[1:42:42] want to do your will and what God wants
[1:42:45] you to do this flesh pulls you one way
[1:42:48] it doesn't want to do it but the Holy
[1:42:49] Spirit pulls you another amen and uh
[1:42:51] Jesus was Victorious right after that he
[1:42:54] says nevertheless not my will but thy
[1:42:58] will be done how many believes every
[1:43:01] True Believer you come down to that test
[1:43:03] I don't care how forsaken you seem to be
[1:43:06] how bad things get if you after you
[1:43:08] become a Christian and then you get down
[1:43:10] to where the Prophet God did when God
[1:43:11] took his wife took his child because he
[1:43:13] didn't go preach when he was supposed to
[1:43:16] devil whispered in his ear he says you
[1:43:18] know there is a
[1:43:20] God couldn't tell him there was no God
[1:43:22] but he don't love you huh if he loved
[1:43:26] you he would raise your wife up he would
[1:43:27] save your child your little Sharon Rose
[1:43:30] little bitty girl amen he would he would
[1:43:33] be merciful he's not merciful and the
[1:43:36] devil almost told him he says if that
[1:43:39] that's how God going to
[1:43:41] be huh if that's how God's going to be
[1:43:44] but he never let the words come out he
[1:43:45] says the Lord gave the Lord taken away
[1:43:49] blessed be the name of the Lord later on
[1:43:52] his doctor said but man did you did you

[1:47:38] god-given Privileges and so forth how
[1:47:41] many believes that today we've had the

[1:47:58] should be
[1:47:59] better we should have recovered from
[1:48:02] sickness we should have recovered from
[1:48:04] lukewarmness we should have recovered
[1:48:06] from a bad attitude from bad spirits

[1:48:49] and talking about how that we need
[1:48:51] healing the nation
[1:48:53] needs
[1:48:54] healing now I may ask you this do you
[1:48:56] really think they're going to find the
[1:48:58] right way to get
[1:49:02] healing they could if they wanted to but
[1:49:04] they're not to accept that way are they
[1:49:07] now they're going to accept some
[1:49:09] substitute or some other way to try to
[1:49:11] get everybody to be healed there's only
[1:49:13] one way that we could ever be healed and
[1:49:16] that is through Jesus Christ the Lord no
[1:49:19] other way only through the Holy Ghost
[1:49:22] could there be ever any recovery any
[1:49:24] healing you take you take two people
[1:49:27] that have odds with each other have a
[1:49:28] spat with each other have differences
[1:49:30] with each other how many know they won't
[1:49:32] never get healed outside of forgiveness
[1:49:36] they'll never get healed outside of the
[1:49:37] grace of almighty God Amen they'll
[1:49:40] receive G forgiveness when they accept
[1:49:41] the Holy Spirit and the way that God say
[1:49:43] for them to be healed amen they can be
[1:49:46] healed amen so much talk about healing
[1:49:50] but yet they won't come to the one way
[1:49:51] that God has
[1:49:53] oh I'm so glad to know that there is one
[1:49:55] way one Lord One Faith one baptism only
[1:49:59] one there's only one way I am the way
[1:50:01] the truth and life no man come to the
[1:50:03] father but by me only by the Holy Ghost
[1:50:08] amen but yet the brother man I'm talked
[1:50:11] about how that people will be is sitting
[1:50:13] in church pews and will
[1:50:16] die people actually sit in the pews and
[1:50:19] die when there's a medicine there for
[1:50:21] them many of them are in as in type and
[1:50:25] me go to a doctor's office and they'll

[1:50:35] solution for you huh no I don't want to
[1:50:39] come in I don't want to take that

[1:53:15] the heart it's just here and in here
[1:53:19] it'll never work it's got to be down
[1:53:21] here cuz when gets right how many knows
[1:53:23] when it gets lined up right God will
[1:53:25] come down with that cure and the desire

[1:53:46] your
[1:53:47] neighbor your family and so forth amen
[1:53:51] sometimes it's hard but but it always
[1:53:53] does you good and sometimes it takes bad
[1:53:55] tasting medicine sometimes to do you any
[1:54:00] good oh
[1:54:03] my like brother says some preachers have
[1:54:05] to preach and I'll tell you what if he
[1:54:07] preaches too long he says there was a
[1:54:08] minister come and said you know his
[1:54:10] Deacon board came up to him and says you
[1:54:11] know you went over again today we did
[1:54:14] not call we didn't hire you to come up
[1:54:16] here and to scold us and to keep us all
[1:54:19] day and so
[1:54:20] forth you know and if do that again
[1:54:23] we'll we'll get you out of here and so
[1:54:25] forth brother brah says I would love to
[1:54:27] have that congregation just once first
[1:54:30] of all we'd stay all day and they'd hear
[1:54:33] me speak out at least one time they'd
[1:54:35] hear
[1:54:36] it he didn't have much for that kind of
[1:54:39] stuff huh why because sometimes it may
[1:54:43] not taste real good it might be kind of
[1:54:45] hard on us sometime folks ain't that
[1:54:47] right it might be a little hard for us
[1:54:49] to be told that look if you still have
[1:54:51] issues and problems is because you
[1:54:53] didn't take the toxin like you should
[1:54:55] you haven't got the remedy you haven't
[1:54:57] been healed of it like you should be
[1:54:59] healed of it praise the Lord how many
[1:55:01] know the sin to desire for sin will be
[1:55:03] gone this is one big major problem in
[1:55:06] Christianity is people think they can be
[1:55:08] born again and still have the same
[1:55:10] desires they did
[1:55:13] before no no no no it don't work that
[1:55:16] way not true
[1:55:18] Christianity
[1:55:20] amen you get the holy GH go sister and
[1:55:23] I'll tell you what you go around wearing
[1:55:24] pants you're going to take them off and
[1:55:26] put a skirt on you've been cutting your
[1:55:28] hair you'll let it grow long cuz Paul
[1:55:30] said that you ought to let it grow long
[1:55:32] and me brother you ain't been treating
[1:55:33] your wife right you'll start treating
[1:55:35] her better than what you did ain't that
[1:55:37] right sister if you're not subject to
[1:55:39] your husband it'll start making you be a
[1:55:41] little more subject that's exactly right
[1:55:43] little by little why because it tells
[1:55:47] you the desire of your heart now one
[1:55:51] thing Prophet taught us and this is this
[1:55:54] some people don't even accept remember
[1:55:57] Mr best he says come and prove Pro it
[1:55:59] there is no such a thing as Divine
[1:56:02] Healing but we know that when he was
[1:56:04] bruised for our iniquity chastisement of
[1:56:06] our peace was upon him and by his
[1:56:08] stripes we were
[1:56:11] healed amen healing is absolutely in the
[1:56:15] contract it's part of the Covenant just
[1:56:17] as much as anything healing is not is
[1:56:20] only healing that but healing is all so
[1:56:22] the earnest of the
[1:56:25] Resurrection before I finish I want to
[1:56:27] finish with and close with the thought
[1:56:29] of healing being the earnest of our
[1:56:31] Resurrection but I want to talk to you
[1:56:32] about another part brother Bram in 1965
[1:56:35] and uh uh uh who is this mzc remember
[1:56:39] it's one of his last sermons that he
[1:56:41] preached and he was talking about people
[1:56:43] having the Holy Ghost and getting the
[1:56:44] Holy Ghost and so forth he says you
[1:56:47] listen you women claiming that you got
[1:56:49] the Holy Ghost and going out here and
[1:56:50] wearing shorts and things how could you
[1:56:52] do it how could the spirit of God ever
[1:56:54] let you do such a thing as that it just
[1:56:56] can't be certainly it can't he's not a
[1:56:59] filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and
[1:57:01] listen and then when you come become
[1:57:03] subject to that Spirit it throws your
[1:57:05] whole being subject to that
[1:57:08] Spirit how many know that's what we're
[1:57:10] striving for is for our body to be
[1:57:14] subject to the spirit of God cuz I'm
[1:57:17] here to tell you one of these days Jesus
[1:57:19] is going to come in the Clouds of Sky
[1:57:21] those can can see him that he shows
[1:57:23] himself to we'll be caught up to meet
[1:57:25] him in the air so shall we ever be with
[1:57:26] the Lord but before that happens
[1:57:29] something has to take place now I want
[1:57:31] to show you with this reading of this
[1:57:33] quote to show you whether or not you
[1:57:36] have a good sign of whether or not is
[1:57:37] that okay listen close and that spirit
[1:57:40] is nothing in the world but the seed
[1:57:42] word made manifest or quickened Made
[1:57:44] Alive Heen when the Bible says don't do
[1:57:47] this that body quickly turns to it huh
[1:57:51] when you hear it is on take and you
[1:57:52] quickly do it all
[1:57:56] right there's no question what about
[1:57:59] this uh he what about it he says it's
[1:58:01] the earnest of the
[1:58:03] Resurrection it's the earnest because
[1:58:06] your body is coming subject to that word
[1:58:09] coming more like that word this body
[1:58:11] it's the earnest of the Resurrection
[1:58:13] this body will be raised up again
[1:58:15] because it's already started how many
[1:58:18] know first your body and your spirit has
[1:58:21] to come subject to the it gets Rises up
[1:58:24] higher above sin above doubt above
[1:58:27] frustration above holding grievances
[1:58:30] above holding grudges Rises up forgiving
[1:58:34] everybody their sin nothing have nothing
[1:58:36] no against no ain't that right having
[1:58:38] perfect love for everybody it makes me
[1:58:41] love everybody makes me love ain't that
[1:58:43] right yeah it it is Raising you up it's
[1:58:47] already started he said it was one
[1:58:49] subject to sin and to mire and into
[1:58:52] corruption but now it's got the earnest
[1:58:55] it's turned Heavenly that's the earnest
[1:58:58] that you're going in the Rapture that's
[1:59:02] what he said it's the earnest when you
[1:59:05] find yourself obeying coming subject to
[1:59:08] the word of
[1:59:10] God remember if you don't you're just
[1:59:13] kidding yourself you're lying he that
[1:59:16] says he loves God keeps not his command
[1:59:18] is a liar and I'm sure all of us I Know
[1:59:21] Myself say
[1:59:22] I know even in this last year I could
[1:59:24] give you testimony of how God's worked
[1:59:25] on me he's working on all of us how many
[1:59:28] beli he's working on every one of us if
[1:59:30] you're a True Believer he's working on
[1:59:31] you saying look at that look at this in
[1:59:33] your life look that in your life amen
[1:59:37] the Bible says this or brother Braham
[1:59:39] said that ah he didn't no you don't
[1:59:41] think that we say God I want to be right
[1:59:44] how many wants to be right those only
[1:59:46] those that are right I read
[1:59:50] a quote down the other day brother B
[1:59:52] says you know only those that are
[1:59:53] perfect are going because Jesus says be
[1:59:56] ye perfect even as my father is in
[1:59:58] heaven is perfect it'll take Perfection
[2:00:00] to get you there how many knows every
[2:00:02] Christian Longs for that Perfection to
[2:00:05] be healed of everything that's wrong and
[2:00:07] have that healing bomb coming into your
[2:00:09] heart and make you what you're supposed
[2:00:11] to be because we are ready the Bible
[2:00:13] says we have if this Earthly Tabernacle
[2:00:15] of this body be dissolved we have
[2:00:16] already one waiting over y we're already
[2:00:19] glorified we have a theophany body
[2:00:21] waiting it's a perfect body and we're
[2:00:23] longing to go into that perfect body
[2:00:27] amen the more Perfection you desire the
[2:00:30] more it shows that you've got a body
[2:00:31] waiting over there
[2:00:33] amen amen it's the earnest now the other
[2:00:37] part now listen a sick person laying
[2:00:39] dying nothing left but death this is the
[2:00:41] last part I want to get to this morning
[2:00:43] how that it shows that every time that
[2:00:47] we get healed of anything whe no matter
[2:00:49] what it is Divine Healing
[2:00:53] he says listen and and then we could
[2:00:55] take different illustrations like I said
[2:00:57] a visit Prophet visit South Africa I'm
[2:00:59] not sure what uh name was but she was
[2:01:01] down to just Skin and Bones many people
[2:01:03] were down to just Skin and Bones and
[2:01:06] that lady said brother brandom all I
[2:01:08] want you to do is pray that I can die I
[2:01:12] just want to die is that
[2:01:15] right she was so miserable and had been
[2:01:18] so sick and was so skinny she just
[2:01:20] didn't want to live any longer
[2:01:22] but instead of Dying God raised her up
[2:01:25] and healed her prophet of God was just
[2:01:27] an instrument that God used is't that
[2:01:29] right Jesus does all the healing and
[2:01:31] that lady raised up and get more weight
[2:01:33] and got to live a good life from Skin
[2:01:36] and Bones whether people are eat up and
[2:01:38] just absolutely nothing left hundreds
[2:01:40] and thousands of people in that
[2:01:42] condition that God raised back
[2:01:46] up nothing left but death that's all
[2:01:50] that seems like it could happen I've
[2:01:52] seen the shadows of people done eat up
[2:01:54] with cancer and tuberculosis to see them
[2:01:56] persons a little while after that
[2:01:58] perfectly normal and strong he says if
[2:02:01] there is no Divine Healing there is no
[2:02:08] Resurrection because Divine Healing is
[2:02:11] the earnest of the
[2:02:13] Resurrection
[2:02:15] amen he says you know what earnest money
[2:02:18] is it's a down
[2:02:19] payment he was wounded for our
[2:02:21] transgression by his stripes we are
[2:02:26] healed not only can he cut or heal your
[2:02:29] cut not only can he heal your sickness
[2:02:31] not only can he cure somebody that's
[2:02:33] just Skin and Bones and cancer not only
[2:02:36] can he raise that but back that person
[2:02:38] back up to life to filling out to be
[2:02:41] happy but one day if your body is
[2:02:47] completely dissolved in the grave one
[2:02:50] day he'll heal that he'll raise it back
[2:02:53] up in that right he'll change it into
[2:02:55] very I don't care if you were eaten by
[2:02:57] lions down through the Dark Ages and
[2:02:58] martyrs mirror and so forth burned that
[2:03:00] the steak and there's just Adams out
[2:03:02] there he'll heal it one of these days
[2:03:04] he'll bring it completely back into
[2:03:06] perfect form that's why Divine Healing
[2:03:09] is an Earnest that God can restore he
[2:03:12] can bring back to its original
[2:03:15] state that's what we're all looking for
[2:03:18] is that right folks there's a lot of us
[2:03:20] you know I'll probably have to take a
[2:03:22] second look it'll take divine grace amen
[2:03:24] and I don't know what brother parish is
[2:03:25] going to look like you know we could
[2:03:26] have have his picture here at 20 years
[2:03:28] old but brother I'll tell you what when
[2:03:30] I meet you I'll know you by God's grace
[2:03:32] but you're gonna look different then me
[2:03:34] I'm going to look a whole lot different
[2:03:35] look at my picture amen at 20 year I
[2:03:37] look way different we all changed a lot
[2:03:39] but God's going to restore us back to
[2:03:41] about 20 years old the prime of our
[2:03:44] life how many is going to be the
[2:03:46] ultimate healing the ultimate healing
[2:03:50] when the Lord comes in the skies and
[2:03:52] changes these vile bodies into the
[2:03:55] Glorious Liberty of Jesus Christ how
[2:03:57] many's looking for that I don't know
[2:03:59] about you my longing is to see that
[2:04:01] Resurrection he looking for the Rapture
[2:04:03] any day now amen that congregation let
[2:04:06] me encourage you in the name of the Lord
[2:04:08] keep your eye on the Rapture keep your
[2:04:11] eye on that end keep it focused amen
[2:04:14] because everything else is nothing but a
[2:04:16] distraction nothing more important than
[2:04:19] to be ready for the Rapture because it
[2:04:21] could happen any time it astounds me
[2:04:25] brother Stephen it sounds me to think
[2:04:26] that we're almost 50 almost 50 years
[2:04:29] past what brother brandom expecting
[2:04:31] that's almost half a century maybe seven
[2:04:33] years or something almost a half a
[2:04:35] century past what the
[2:04:37] prophet expected this thing to last is
[2:04:40] that right I want you to know that's a
[2:04:42] long time that means it's desperately
[2:04:45] late
[2:04:47] amen can I do one more thing for you all
