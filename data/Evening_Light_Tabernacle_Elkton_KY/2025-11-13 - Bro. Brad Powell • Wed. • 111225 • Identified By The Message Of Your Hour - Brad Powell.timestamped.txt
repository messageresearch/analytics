[14:34] where they are, I say
[14:39] my sins are gone.
[14:42] There underneath the blood on the cross
[14:47] of Calvary. Oh, they're as far removed
[14:51] as darkness is from dawn.
[14:56] Well, in the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[15:00] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[15:06] My sins are
[15:09] and was at the old time altar where God
[15:14] came in my heart and now
[15:19] my sins are gone.
[15:23] The Lord took full possession.
[15:27] The devil did depart. Well, I'm so glad
[15:33] my sins are gone. Oh yes. Well, they're
[15:38] underneath the blood on the cross of
[15:42] Calvary.
[15:43] They're as far removed as darkness is
[15:47] from dawn.
[15:50] Well, in the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[15:54] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[16:00] My sins are gone.
[16:03] And when Satan comes to tempt me and
[16:08] tries to make me doubt, I
[16:14] my sins are gone.
[16:17] Well, you got me into trouble, but Jesus
[16:23] got me out. I'm glad
[16:27] my sins are gone.
[16:31] Well, there underneath the blood on the
[16:35] cross of Calvary. Oh, they're as far
[16:39] removed as darkness is from dawn.
[16:44] Oh, in the sea of God's forfulness,
[16:48] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[16:54] My sins are gone.
[16:58] Well, I'm living now for Jesus. I'm
[17:03] happy night and day because
[17:08] my sins are gone.
[17:12] My soul is filled with music. With all
[17:16] my heart I sing, I know
[17:22] sins are gone.
[17:25] fail there underneath the blood on the
[17:29] cross of Calvary.
[17:32] They're as far removed as dark says from
[17:36] dawn.
[17:38] Oh, in the sea of God's formula
[17:42] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[17:48] My s the chorus again. Well, there
[17:53] underneath the blood of the cross of
[17:57] Calvary.
[17:59] They're as far removed as darkness is
[18:03] from dawn
[18:06] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[18:10] That's good enough for you. Praise God.
[18:16] My sins are gone.
[18:19] Amen. Aren't you thankful? You may be
[18:21] seated tonight. God bless you. I won't
[18:23] keep you standing. And Amen. And it's
[18:27] just good to be in the house of the
[18:28] Lord. Amen. Let's sing that song if we
[18:30] could. And I I guess that one of the
[18:32] reasons why this song come on my heart,
[18:34] I'd listen to uh statue of a perfect
[18:37] man. And brother Brandham was talking
[18:39] about love and fill my way every day
[18:42] with love. And you know when
[18:45] the testimony they give of brother
[18:47] Brandham said, you didn't know who his
[18:49] enemy or who his friends were. He
[18:51] treated everybody the same. And I said,
[18:54] "Lord, I need a lot of help in that
[18:56] area. I just have to be honest. I need a
[18:59] lot of help." And said, "Lord,
[19:02] when they walk down the street, I don't
[19:04] want them to say there's a grumpy old
[19:06] man, but there's a Christian. There's
[19:08] someone that's kind to everybody and
[19:10] treats them right." That's what I want
[19:13] to be said, that I'm a Christian. Amen.
[19:16] That's my heart's desire. Well, let me
[19:19] walk. Blessed Lord, in the way thou has
[19:24] gone, leading straight to the land
[19:28] above.
[19:31] Well, giving cheer everywhere to the
[19:35] sand and the Lord. Well, fill my way
[19:40] every day with your love.
[19:44] Oh, fill my way every day with your
[19:49] love.
[19:51] Well, as I walk with a heavenly d.
[19:58] And let me go all the while with a song
[20:03] and a smile.
[20:07] Every day with love.
[20:12] Well, keep me close to the side of my
[20:16] savior and guide. Let me never in
[20:22] darkness
[20:23] ro.
[20:25] Well, keep my path free from wrath and
[20:29] my soul satisfied. Well, fill my way
[20:34] every day with your love.
[20:39] Oh, fill my way every day with your
[20:43] love.
[20:46] Oh, as I walk with the heavenly love
[20:53] and let me go all the while with a song
[20:58] and a smile. Fill my way every day with
[21:04] love.
[21:06] Now soon my race will be over and I'll
[21:11] travel no more. But abide in my home
[21:17] above.
[21:20] Let me sing blessed king all the way to
[21:26] the shore. And fill my way every day
[21:31] with love.
[21:34] will fill my way every day with your
[21:38] love.
[21:41] Oh, as I walk with a heavenly dove
[21:47] and let me go
[21:56] every day with love.
[22:01] Well, I'm feeling so much better
[22:05] talking about this good old way. I'm
[22:09] feeling so much better
[22:12] talking about the Lord. So, let's go on.
[22:17] Let's go on talking about this good old
[22:21] way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking
[22:26] about the Lord. Oh, the devil he don't
[22:30] like it talking about this good old one.
[22:35] The devil he don't talk
[22:39] talking about the Lord. So let's go on.
[22:44] Let's go on talking about this good old
[22:48] way. Well, let's go on. Let's go on
[22:53] talking about the Lord.
[22:57] Amen. Brother Daniel and brother Michael
[22:59] John,
[23:01] come ahead. Brother Glenn, you can help
[23:02] him tonight. And we have some prayer
[23:05] requests tonight. And

[23:20] softly, Sister Becky, if you would." and
[23:22] and also Sister

[26:43] Oh Jesus

[26:49] Oh Jesus. I'll get you some water. There
[26:52] he is.
[26:56] All things are possible
[27:01] for Jesus
[27:04] is here.
[27:07] Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[27:08] Lord tonight. Good to be a Christian.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Child of God.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; What a what a pleasure. What an honor.
[27:17] What a privilege. If you could, why
[27:19] don't you just have your seats for a few
[27:20] minutes? We got a few few things we need
[27:23] to uh kind of cover and go over. We had
[27:24] mentioned the the saints in Jamaica and
[27:27] we we didn't take time Sunday with the
[27:30] change and different things that we were
[27:31] trying. Thank you, brother David. And
[27:33] with the so with the new pre-ervice and
[27:36] so forth, but we do want to take time
[27:37] tonight to kind of we're going to try to
[27:39] pull up some pictures there. I I did
[27:41] talk to uh Brother Wade Dale. Uh many of
[27:44] you probably know Brother Wade. He's
[27:45] been here many times and you don't if
[27:48] you ever meet him, you'll never forget
[27:50] him. That's just the way it is. It's the
[27:52] man with two first names.
[27:54] Wade Dale. So, uh, but anyway, he's he's
[27:59] been a friend of ours through the years
[28:00] and and an associate with brother Ber
[28:03] over the years. And so, he he's very
[28:06] close with brother Keith Reed in Jamaica
[28:08] and the and the Jamaicans and the
[28:10] situation. I kind of got him to kind of
[28:13] see what all needed to be. And he pretty
[28:15] much I said I said, "What what do they
[28:18] what do they need, you know, and and
[28:20] from your perspective?" And he said,
[28:21] "Just funds, funds." You know, he said,
[28:24] "We was going to send this and send that
[28:26] and they don't need us to send stuff.
[28:28] They've got stuff there. They just need
[28:30] funds to purchase." And so, um, I said,
[28:33] "Well, what are we talking about?" You
[28:35] know, and I said, " 20,000, 40,000." He
[28:39] said, "Well, 20,000 will put a roof on
[28:41] one one church."
[28:43] And uh so um he said I I I don't you
[28:48] know we we can send they'll they'll make
[28:49] sure that it's allotted and be able to
[28:51] fix those churches. So maybe brother
[28:53] Mike if you just maybe pull up one of
[28:55] those pictures there and I guess we'll
[28:57] try to kill these lights real quick.
[29:03] The way they were sent to me.
[29:06] Okay. the way they were sent to me.
[29:09] That's we're a little bit grainy. So,
[29:13] we'll do the best we can with what we
[29:15] got.
[29:17] So, this is a this is one of the
[29:19] churches. I'm not sure if this is Ginger
[29:21] Hill Church or which church that is um
[29:25] or Northampton.
[29:28] I'm not sure. But I I feel like we we've
[29:31] been there. Maybe some of you visited
[29:32] there when we took our trip years ago to
[29:34] Jamaica. So, uh, next picture or video
[29:38] the the pictures you can see the roof is
[29:40] completely gone. The sound systems
[29:42] ruined the it's been uh some of the
[29:45] churches were looted afterwards. Uh, the
[29:48] wind has has you know shifted
[29:50] everything. So, quite a disastrous
[29:52] state. You can tell that the churches
[29:54] were um, you know, primitive to begin
[29:57] with. So, uh, if you could maybe we'll
[30:00] just show one of those videos. We don't
[30:01] want to take a lot of time, but I just
[30:02] want to let you know what the situation
[30:04] is there.
[31:35] I think that's good, brother Michael, on
[31:37] that. That gives you an idea. Like I
[31:40] said, we don't want to take a lot of
[31:41] time, but just the situation what she
[31:43] was saying. I don't know if you could
[31:44] hear it, but in the in the other videos
[31:46] there, she uh was making mention of the
[31:49] uh the roof. They just put that roof on.
[31:51] It's supposed to be a a storm kind of
[31:53] like a storm storm proof roof, I guess.
[31:57] And she said, "I think we got a raw
[31:59] deal."
[32:01] So, you can imagine what it would be
[32:03] like if we were to walk in this next
[32:05] Sunday and that our church looked like
[32:07] that and we've got insurance and we
[32:09] would we would definitely be okay. They
[32:11] don't have insurance. They they don't
[32:13] they just they just have what they have
[32:16] and they they love uh love the Lord. And
[32:19] so, uh, Brother Ber said, "What we'll do
[32:21] is we'll take up an offering this coming
[32:23] Sunday and, uh, we'll make sure that it
[32:26] gets in the right hands." Uh, Brother
[32:27] Wade said he would help us send through
[32:29] his Western Union. Um, because they
[32:33] don't charge as much. And so, you have
[32:35] to have the right avenues or the
[32:37] government taxes and takes and we don't
[32:40] want that to happen. So he's got the
[32:42] right channels and that's what you
[32:43] always have to be very cautious and
[32:45] careful when you're doing any kind of
[32:46] missionary work and work out of the
[32:48] country is make sure that you're
[32:50] funneling through the right channels and
[32:51] make sure things are are handled
[32:53] appropriately. So I think I feel good
[32:55] about it, brother Ber. And if if brother
[32:57] Ber said felt good about it, so we would
[32:59] take up an offering um and just as as
[33:02] the Lord lays on your heart this
[33:03] weekend, we'll make sure it gets there.
[33:05] So, um, also just want to make mention,
[33:09] uh, myself and, uh, brother Tommy and
[33:14] brother Troy will be heading out. I
[33:15] think brother Troy is going to go. We're
[33:17] going to try to drag him along. He he's
[33:19] giving me the nod. So, we're going to be
[33:21] going up to Akaran, Ohio to Brother
[33:23] Jesse Smith's this weekend. Uh, we'll be
[33:26] ministering there on Sunday. Brother
[33:27] Tommy will be giving his testimony on
[33:30] uh, on um, Saturday night, 6:30. Um, if
[33:35] anybody wants to watch, I'm sure you
[33:36] could find it. I think it's the bride of
[33:39] Akran Church. Is that right? I think
[33:41] that's right. So, if anybody wants to
[33:44] watch that and then follow up uh and see
[33:47] see what we've done up there, but we're
[33:49] looking forward to it. Pray for us. It's
[33:50] a it's a it's a pretty long drive up
[33:52] there, but it can be done in a day and
[33:55] we'll we'll leave early Saturday
[33:57] morning, come home Sunday afternoon
[33:59] after I preach. So, um I'm uh I'm pretty
[34:03] excited about it. Go up there and
[34:05] fellowship with brother Jesse and u
[34:07] taking my amen corner with me so I don't
[34:09] have to worry about that. And I I know I
[34:11] have two ameners anyway. So, we'll uh
[34:14] we'll we'll just go with what the Lord
[34:17] leads us. So, stand with me if you
[34:18] would. We'll try to get right into the
[34:20] word and I feel like I've got a lot on
[34:22] the plate tonight and I don't want to
[34:24] hold you long. So, but bear with me. I
[34:27] feel like uh the Lord has given us
[34:28] something tonight special for us. So
[34:31] turn in the book of Isaiah 53.
[34:39] Very familiar scripture. We ought to
[34:41] know this one by heart. And you know
[34:44] before we get into that into that
[34:46] scripture I want to read you what
[34:47] something the prophet said. He said it
[34:50] pleased God the great sculptor. Now
[34:53] think about this. to smite him,
[34:56] to do it this way. We see him here in
[34:59] Isaiah here as I read. We all did esteem
[35:03] him. We turned our face from him.
[35:05] There's no beauty that we should desire
[35:06] him. And everybody talking about him,
[35:09] making fun of him. I'm talking of I I'm
[35:11] talking about him now in this day.
[35:13] Everybody making fun of him. We did
[35:15] esteem him and saw him. Esteem means to
[35:17] look at. We esteemed him smitten and
[35:19] afflicted of God. Yet he, what did he do
[35:22] this for? He was wounded for our
[35:26] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[35:30] iniquities, he said. Now, we could go on
[35:32] and on and on with that, but I believe
[35:34] you have the picture of what I mean now,
[35:37] God building back his masterpiece. He
[35:40] says, but let us not forget that in the
[35:42] beginning when he smoked the side of
[35:44] Adam, he took something out of his side.
[35:47] He said, 'Now the smiting of Christ was
[35:49] for a cause that that he might take from
[35:53] him one to be a family, the bride. He
[35:59] said he might take him a bride so that
[36:01] when his masterpiece was perfected, then
[36:04] he had to smite it to take it from him.
[36:07] Not another piece, not another creation,
[36:12] but of the same creation. Oh my my
[36:16] brother. He says, "Don't think bad at
[36:18] this, but think a minute. If he took
[36:20] from him the original creation to make a
[36:23] bride for him, he never made another
[36:25] creation. He took a part of the original
[36:28] creation. Then if he was the word, what
[36:31] must the bride be? It's got to be the
[36:35] original word. Living God in the word."
[36:40] Amen. We could go home on that. God is
[36:43] good. Let's say read Isaiah 53 and we're
[36:46] going to read it all. Who hath believed
[36:49] our report? In whom is the arm of the
[36:51] Lord revealed? So Isaiah here now he's
[36:54] he's speaking and he's thinking as we
[36:57] see this unfolding, who hath believed
[36:59] our report? Who is going to believe that
[37:01] a man such as Jesus who is nothing to
[37:03] look at? He's not handsome. He's not
[37:05] beautiful. Now he's he's marred and he's
[37:08] smitten. Who's going to believe this?
[37:10] And especially now, who is going to
[37:12] believe what he's done this for?
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Who's going to believe this? And to whom
[37:18] of the arm of uh of the Lord revealed
[37:20] for he shall grow up before him as a
[37:23] tender plant, as a root out of the dry
[37:24] ground. He has no form, no comeliness.
[37:28] When we shall see him, there is no
[37:29] beauty that we should desire him. He is
[37:32] despised. He's rejected of men, a man of
[37:35] sorrows and acquainted with grief. and
[37:38] we hid as it were our faces from him. He
[37:41] was despised and we esteemed him not.
[37:45] Surely he hath borne our griefs and
[37:48] carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem
[37:52] him stricken, smitten of God, and
[37:54] afflicted.
[37:56] But he was wounded for our
[37:58] transgressions.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[38:02] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[38:05] and with his stripes we are healed.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; That's a promise.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; And we all we like sheep have gone
[38:13] astray. We have turned everyone to his
[38:16] own ways. And the Lord hath laid upon
[38:18] him the iniquity of us all.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Our iniquities laid upon him
[38:25] &gt;&gt; by loving God.
[38:28] He was oppressed. He was afflicted. Yet
[38:30] he opened not his mouth. He was brought
[38:33] as a lamb to the slaughter and as a
[38:35] sheep before the hers is dumb. So he
[38:38] opened not his mouth. He was taken from
[38:41] prison and judgment. And who shall
[38:43] declare this generation? For he was cut
[38:46] out of the land of the living. For the
[38:48] transgression of my people was he
[38:51] stricken.
[38:53] For the transgression of Elton,
[38:55] Kentucky.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; For the transgression of the United
[38:58] States. for the transgression of Europe
[39:02] and Africa,
[39:04] for the transgression of the entire
[39:06] world.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; And he made his grave with the wicked
[39:11] and with the rich in his death, because
[39:13] he had done no violence, neither was
[39:15] there any deceit in his mouth. Now,
[39:18] here's the most astounding statement.
[39:21] Yet, it pleased the Lord to bruise him.
[39:25] Wow.
[39:29] It pleased the Lord to bruise him.
[39:33] He hath put him to grief. When thou
[39:36] shalt make his soul an offering for sin,
[39:38] he shall see his seed. He shall prolong
[39:40] his days, and the pleasure of the Lord
[39:42] shall prosper in his hand. He shall see
[39:44] the travail of his soul. He shall be
[39:46] satisfied. By his knowledge shall my
[39:49] righteous servant justify many. For he
[39:52] shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I
[39:56] will I divide him a portion with the
[39:58] great, and he shall divide the spoil
[39:59] with the strong, because he hath poured
[40:02] out his soul unto death. And he was
[40:04] numbered with the transgressors,
[40:07] and he bear the sins of many,
[40:11] and made intercession for the
[40:14] transgressors.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[40:18] That's Genesis to Revelations right
[40:20] there, brothers. Let's just pray.
[40:23] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[40:25] day. We thank you for your blessings. We
[40:27] thank you for the word that we've just
[40:28] read and the story that's told in Isaiah
[40:32] 53 of a loving, perfect savior, a loving
[40:36] God who found uh it found it pleasing to
[40:42] save the entire world through the
[40:44] suffering of his own son. Lord, how
[40:46] humble we should be, how meek, how lowly
[40:49] we should be, how thankful, Lord, and
[40:51] help us to never take for granted what
[40:53] was done for us or that perfection that
[40:56] was given for us, Lord. We just want to
[40:59] ask, Lord, that you just be with us
[41:00] tonight as we minister the word. Open
[41:02] our hearts to receive that we would just
[41:04] get closer to you. And if there's
[41:06] somebody that needs healing tonight, may
[41:08] there be healing in the word. If
[41:09] somebody needs deliverance, may there be
[41:11] deliverance in the word tonight. If
[41:13] somebody just needs a closer walk with
[41:15] you and a and a filling of the Holy
[41:17] Ghost, may they find a closer walk with
[41:19] you and a filling of the Holy Ghost and
[41:22] it's in your precious name we ask these
[41:24] things in the lovely name of Jesus
[41:26] Christ. Amen.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have your seats.
[41:30] I want to speak tonight if we could on
[41:33] identified by the message of your hour.
[41:37] Identified by the message of your hour.
[41:41] So, a few services ago, we we begin to
[41:43] preach and we were talking and we were
[41:45] talking about diamonds and we were
[41:47] talking about how the diamonds were made
[41:49] and and we we were talking there and I
[41:51] got to looking and thinking about these
[41:52] diamonds some more. And as I got to
[41:54] thinking, I seen where brother Brandon
[41:55] was talking about the diamonds. He was
[41:57] at the Kimberly Mines in South Africa, I
[42:00] think. And he said there was just a big
[42:01] old pile of priceless diamonds there. He
[42:04] said, "But there was no sparkle in them
[42:05] whatsoever." So he asked the guy, "Why
[42:08] why are these so valuable when there's
[42:09] no sparkle?" He said, "Well, the thing
[42:11] is they're valuable, but they just
[42:13] haven't been cut yet."
[42:16] &gt;&gt; And you know, we talked ABOUT THAT
[42:18] CUTTING THOSE DIAMONDS. BY CUTTING THEM,
[42:20] you find out what the brilliance is on
[42:22] the inside. And when we were preaching
[42:24] that service, I made a statement at the
[42:26] end of that service and I said that
[42:29] perfect became imperfect so that
[42:31] imperfect could become perfect.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I said that at the end of
[42:36] that, I didn't have it in my notes and I
[42:37] didn't have it written down. I never I
[42:39] hadn't really even thought about it, but
[42:40] when I said it, it stuck with me and it
[42:43] stuck with me. And I over the next few
[42:45] days, I began to think about that
[42:47] statement over and over and over. And I
[42:49] couldn't get that simple little
[42:50] statement out out of my head or off of
[42:53] my mind. And so I I I I begin to get in
[42:56] preparation for these services coming up
[42:58] this this weekend with brother Jesse's.
[43:00] And and as I begin to think about that
[43:02] service and and thinking about this
[43:03] service, I was trying to find the
[43:05] direction and the leadership of the
[43:06] Lord, which way are we going to go? And
[43:08] because we want to make sure we're in
[43:09] tune with God. We want to make sure when
[43:11] we go before the people that we're
[43:13] delivering what God would have for the
[43:15] people. And so I began to sit there and
[43:17] I began to pray. And a and I went to
[43:19] sleep that night or one night and I woke
[43:21] up the next morning and the first thing
[43:24] that popped into my mind when my eyes
[43:26] opened was the word identified.
[43:31] It wasn't like good morning. It wasn't
[43:34] like hello Lord. It wasn't like did you
[43:37] sleep good honey? Identified.
[43:42] And so I I I began to think about it and
[43:44] I thought, Lord, identified. What What
[43:47] do you mean identified?
[43:49] What? You got to You got to give me some
[43:50] more. I can't just I can't just go off
[43:52] identified. What is it? And and then as
[43:54] I as I got ready to get up, I thought
[43:57] identified. He said, "Identified by the
[44:00] message of your hour." AND IT STUCK WITH
[44:03] ME SO MUCH. I GOT UP immediately and I
[44:05] went straight to my whiteboard. I got
[44:06] three or four big whiteboards in my
[44:08] study. And I just got the marker and I
[44:10] said, "Identify by the message of your
[44:12] hour." Because I didn't want to forget
[44:14] because I don't have those kinds of
[44:16] experiences a lot when I wake up and
[44:18] identified
[44:22] and I didn't want to forget. SO I I GOT
[44:24] THERE AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT and then
[44:26] all of a sudden Isaiah 53 begins to come
[44:28] into my mind. And so I began to ponder
[44:31] these thoughts and and I came across the
[44:33] message, the identified masterpiece of
[44:37] God.
[44:39] And lo and behold, as I began to read
[44:41] and listen and and and get into that
[44:43] message, what scripture do you think was
[44:45] brother Brandham used in that message?
[44:49] Isaiah 53.
[44:51] And now he preached messages before on
[44:53] identification, identified. He preached
[44:55] on the masterpiece. He preached on all
[44:57] these. But this is the one time that I
[44:59] can think and I can find that he
[45:00] preached the identified masterpiece of
[45:03] God. And and looking at this, the
[45:05] prophet begins to talk and he's telling
[45:07] he says God has been making him a
[45:10] masterpiece. And he said because he he
[45:13] struck he struck Adam to get a piece off
[45:16] of off of him off of a part of him and
[45:20] got a rib to make for him a wife. So we
[45:24] can see right here in the very beginning
[45:25] in the garden of Eden, God goes down and
[45:27] he says Adam needs a helpmate.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; So this is in the mind OF CHRIST AS GOD
[45:33] IS TRYING TO PROCESS HIS OWN THOUGHTS
[45:35] into manifestations on earth. So he
[45:39] says, "YOU KNOW WHAT? ADAM NEEDS A
[45:40] HELPMATE. SO, I'M GOING TO GO AND I'M
[45:42] GOING TO PULL SOMETHING OUT OF MY
[45:43] original creation
[45:46] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to make him a bride.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet makes it very clear
[45:51] as we go into the message that she was a
[45:53] byproduct.
[45:57] Adam couldn't fall.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; She was a byproduct of what Adam was.
[46:04] She was a part of that original
[46:06] creation. And so, God pulls her out of
[46:08] there. And the prophet says what he has
[46:11] done. He took and he put the masterpiece
[46:13] and struck him ON CALVARY.
[46:16] NOW he's at we're in THE GARDEN OF EDEN.
[46:18] NOW WE'RE at Calvary. And he said he put
[46:20] that masterpiece and struck him on
[46:22] Calvary and he got a piece of him.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Adam's ribs.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; JESUS ON CALVARY.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the correlation here? And
[46:35] so here he says he's up on Calvary. HE
[46:37] SAYS, "BUT NOW WHAT IT IS, IT'S THE NEW
[46:39] TESTAMENT. ANOTHER piece being
[46:43] fulfilled."
[46:45] &gt;&gt; You see, it didn't just stop AT CALVARY.
[46:47] THERE'S MORE to the story.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; There's more to WHY HE WAS SMITTEN.
[46:52] There is more to WHY HE WAS MOCKED.
[46:54] THERE IS MORE TO WHY HE WAS HE was
[46:56] bruised and and smitten on the cross. It
[46:59] was because he was trying to get a
[47:00] bride.
[47:02] Oh, come on, church. You can do better
[47:05] than that. IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS THE
[47:07] REASON JESUS WENT TO CALVARY AND WAS
[47:09] SMITTEN IN THE SIDE WAS BECAUSE GOD WAS
[47:11] TRYING TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT WAS
[47:12] CREATED PERFECT AND PULL OUT OF HIM A
[47:15] BRIDE THAT WOULD BE PERFECT in this last
[47:18] hour.
[47:21] And he said he he took that old he took
[47:24] the old to foreshadow or foreshadow the
[47:27] new. He said Christ became the
[47:29] masterpiece to fulfill that. Now, his
[47:32] bride will fulfill, listen, his bride
[47:36] will fulfill everything that's in the
[47:39] New Testament.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; You either want to get on this bus or
[47:50] you don't.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; But this bus is going to do some things.
[47:54] This bus is going places. He says it's
[47:57] another masterpiece in the making.
[48:03] It's taken him 4,000 years to make this
[48:07] masterpiece.
[48:08] 2,000 years of making another
[48:11] masterpiece, a bride for Christ. Another
[48:16] masterpiece. And in doing it, he says he
[48:19] does it by his neverchanging method. THE
[48:22] same way he made the masterpiece, by his
[48:27] word.
[48:29] Thank you, Lord.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; By his word.
[48:38] That's the way he makes his masterpiece
[48:41] because he can only be a perfect
[48:43] masterpiece when it's the perfect word.
[48:47] So, in the beginning, God says, "Let
[48:49] there be light.
[48:51] Let there be fishes. Let there be fouls
[48:53] of the air. Let there be trees. LET
[48:55] THERE BE PLANTS. NOW LET US MAKE MAN in
[48:58] our image,
[49:01] &gt;&gt; the spoken word.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; And at the end when Jesus goes to the
[49:08] cross or when he's on the face of the
[49:10] earth, we should say, what did he live
[49:12] by?
[49:14] The word. It is written. WHEN SATAN COME
[49:17] TO HIM, WHAT DID HE SAY? IT IS WRITTEN.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; I SH THOU SHALT NOT. It is written. What
[49:21] if you do this? It's written.
[49:24] AND CONSTANTLY JESUS WAS TAKING them
[49:26] through the parables and through the
[49:27] life as he was living his life. He was
[49:30] taking them through a journey down
[49:31] through the word
[49:33] from Genesis to Revelation.
[49:39] So
[49:42] we see that the word is so important to
[49:46] us tonight.
[49:47] The word to the believer is one of the
[49:49] most important things that you can grasp
[49:51] a hold of. the word I BECAUSE IT
[49:55] IDENTIFIES you with Christ.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; The word identifies you with Christ. And
[50:00] the word, the living word, is what makes
[50:03] us his masterpiece. It's when THE WORD
[50:07] COMES IN ON THE INSIDE OF US AND SETS
[50:09] DOWN AND TAKES A HOLD DOWN DEEP down
[50:11] inside of this heart that once was
[50:13] stony, once was hard, but now has been
[50:16] softened by the Holy Ghost and through
[50:18] the word of God, through the blood of
[50:20] Jesus Christ.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Now we got to we're now we're living the
[50:26] word.
[50:34] His masterpiece says that he'll be
[50:37] without spot. She'll be without spot or
[50:40] wrinkle.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; That's by the word.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; You see, when you're identified, that
[50:47] word identified, it means establish or
[50:50] it indicates who or what someone or
[50:53] something is.
[50:55] So, let's ask ourselves tonight, who are
[50:57] you? Who am I? Who are we?
[51:02] Who are we? WHAT ARE WE IDENTIFIED WITH?
[51:04] When people look at us out ON THE
[51:05] STREET, WHAT DO THEY SAY? THAT PERSON is
[51:11] well, we hope they're saying Christian.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; We hope they're saying it. That person
[51:17] has the Holy Ghost. That person is
[51:20] honest.
[51:22] THAT PERSON IS LOVING. THAT PERSON IS
[51:24] KIND. THAT PERSON is caring. You see,
[51:28] because all those are identifications
[51:30] and attributes of Jesus Christ. So as we
[51:33] go out, WE HOPE THAT we're being
[51:35] identified that way because when we are
[51:38] identified, it means that you re you are
[51:40] recognized and distinguished by somebody
[51:43] that is worthy of attention.
[51:51] So when you walk down the street and
[51:53] they begin to look at these attributes
[51:55] of your life,
[51:57] love, peace, joy, longsuffering,
[52:00] honesty,
[52:02] caring, kind, giving, loving. They begin
[52:05] to look at that. Brothers and sisters,
[52:07] WHAT THAT IS SAYING, IT SAYS THAT GOD IN
[52:09] THIS DAY IS worthy of attention. HE IS
[52:13] WORTHY OF ATTENTION. SO THE SIGNS and
[52:15] the wonders AND THE MIRACLE THAT ARE
[52:17] TAKING PLACE IN the bride of Christ
[52:19] around the world, they are worthy of
[52:22] attention. They are worthy of attention
[52:25] because it identifies that the bride of
[52:28] Jesus Christ in this hour is following
[52:32] the word.
[52:36] Let me tell you tonight, when we see
[52:38] cancers being healed,
[52:42] &gt;&gt; when we see when we see the lost being
[52:44] saved,
[52:46] &gt;&gt; when we see our weward loved ones to
[52:48] begin TO COME BACK AND GET back into the
[52:49] fold and back into the word, when we see
[52:52] sight that has been restored,
[52:57] &gt;&gt; you say, "I'd never seen that." How many
[52:59] of you ever seen Brother Ron Spencer? Do
[53:02] you know his testimony about his eyes?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; THE DOCTOR SAID, "YOU GOT cancer in your
[53:08] eyes, Ron. You got cancer in your eyes
[53:11] and IT'S SO BAD. WE'RE GOING TO have to
[53:13] remove your eyeballs."
[53:17] How many's heard his testimony?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And they begin to pray. And he went to
[53:23] doctor after doctor after doctor and
[53:25] every one of them said the same,
[53:26] "Cancer, we're going to have to remove.
[53:27] Cancer, we're going to have to remove.
[53:29] Cancer, we're going to have to remove."
[53:30] until he goes to this last doctor and
[53:32] him and sister Connie, he said they
[53:34] walked down the hall and they got
[53:36] together and they joined hands and they
[53:37] began to pray, "God, I don't want to
[53:39] lose my eyes."
[53:43] Lord, he said he went in to see that
[53:45] doctor
[53:49] and doctor said, "I'll see you in six
[53:51] months."
[53:53] He said, 'Doc,
[53:57] I've been told I got cancer in my eyes
[53:59] and I'm here to get my eyes removed. Are
[54:01] you sure you're looking at the right
[54:02] case?
[54:05] He said, there's been some kind of
[54:06] mistake.
[54:08] You don't have no cancer IN YOUR EYES.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE NO CANCER IN YOUR EYES.
[54:13] THAT'S GOD MOVING. AND BUT WHY IS THAT?
[54:16] BECAUSE WE ARE IDENTIFIED WITH A MIRACLE
[54:18] WORKING, WONDERWORKING GOD THAT HEALS
[54:21] THE DISEASE of his people.
[54:23] When we see this HAPPEN IN PLACE, WE SEE
[54:25] YOUNG PEOPLE BEING filled with the Holy
[54:27] Ghost.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; ACTS OF THE HOLY GHOST LIKE WE HAVEN'T
[54:32] SEEN IN YEARS.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Some of us have testimonies we need to
[54:36] share.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; You know who you are.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; But this identifies us. This identifies
[54:48] our God in the message that was
[54:49] delivered in this hour. Brothers and
[54:52] sisters, it tells THE WHOLE WORLD THAT
[54:54] THE MESSAGE OF THIS HOUR is alive and
[54:56] well. AND HE HEARS HIS PEOPLE.
[55:00] YOUR CRIES DO NOT GO UNHEARD. THEY DON'T
[55:03] FALL ON DEAF EARS BECAUSE WHY? HE HEARS
[55:06] his people.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT TUCKED AWAY in some stony cave
[55:10] somewhere in a tomb, rolled up in a in a
[55:13] lo in a linen cloth.
[55:16] EVERY OTHER GOD, EVERY other little G
[55:19] god is out there somewhere in a tomb
[55:21] this night.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT MY GOD.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; NOT MY GOD. MY GOD IS NOT IN A TOMB
[55:29] TONIGHT. HE'S LIVING IN THE HEART OF ME.
[55:31] HE'S LIVING IN THE HEART OF YOU. THAT'S
[55:34] WHERE our God is. HE'S SITTING ON A
[55:36] THRONE AND he's delivering to his
[55:38] people. He's not tucked away. BROTHERS
[55:41] AND SISTERS, SHE BECOMES HIM. AMEN.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; We've sang that song for years. He
[55:47] became me that I might become him
[55:48] through grace.
[55:52] Do you do we did we even realize what we
[55:54] were saying?
[55:56] Do we even realize what we were saying
[55:58] all those years? She becomes him.
[56:10] When that side was smitten,
[56:13] when that side was smitten on Calvary,
[56:16] and that blood be to pour out onto the
[56:19] ground of Calvary,
[56:21] you know what that BLOOD DID? THAT BLOOD
[56:24] begin to cover a multitude.
[56:29] That blood be to cover a multitude of
[56:31] sin. That blood BEGIN TO COVER A
[56:34] multitude of wrongdoings.
[56:37] That blood begin to cover a a MULTITUDE
[56:39] OF FILTHY THOUGHTS. THAT BLOOD BEGIN to
[56:42] to cover a multitude of filthy habits.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; What a what a masterpiece.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; What a masterpiece.
[56:53] So much that John says it this way. John
[56:56] 14:12, "Verily, verily, I say unto you
[56:58] that he that believeth on me, the works
[56:59] that I do shall you do also. greater
[57:02] works than these shall he do because I
[57:04] go unto my father.
[57:07] He's telling them, I'm leaving. I'm
[57:09] fixing to leave out of here. And
[57:10] whatsoever you ask of my name, that will
[57:12] I do, that my father may be glorified in
[57:15] the Son. If you ask anything in my name,
[57:17] I will do it. If you love me, keep my
[57:20] commandments, and I will pray the Father
[57:23] that he shall give you another
[57:26] comforter. Who was the comforter?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS THE COMFORTER. EVERYWHERE HE
[57:32] WENT, he comforted the people.
[57:34] EVERYWHERE HE WENT, there was a presence
[57:35] ABOUT HIM. HE SAID, "BUT IF I LEAVE,
[57:39] DON'T WORRY. DON'T PANIC. DON'T FRET,
[57:41] LITTLE LITTLE CHURCH. I'm going to send
[57:44] you another comforter.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; And this COMFORTER MAY B ABIDE WITH you
[57:49] forever.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
[57:53] IS HERE IN THIS HOUR TO ABIDE WITH US
[57:57] FOREVER.
[58:00] Even the spirit of truth whom the the
[58:02] world cannot receive. Because ye seeth
[58:04] him not, it seeth him not, neither
[58:07] knoweth him. But ye KNOW HIM. HOW MANY
[58:10] KNOWS him tonight?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS HIM AS REDEEMER? HOW MANY
[58:14] KNOWS HIM AS HEALER? HOW MANY KNOWS HIM
[58:16] AS DELIVERER? YOU KNOW HIM. AMEN.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; For he dwelleth with you and shall be
[58:28] &gt;&gt; in you.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[58:33] Give the Lord a hand. Let me catch my
[58:35] breath.
[58:39] Hallelujah.
[58:41] You see, when you identify with someone,
[58:44] you become what's called an associate.
[58:48] You're an associate with them. You're an
[58:51] associate with Jesus Christ.
[58:54] YOU'RE AN ASSOCIATE WITH JESUS CHRIST ON
[58:56] THE BASIS OF THE BLOOD THAT WAS SHED ON
[58:59] CALVARY THAT YOU HAVE NOW BEEN redeemed
[59:02] as though you never
[59:05] &gt;&gt; done it.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people cringe when you say
[59:11] that. Oh, look at you smiling. Some of
[59:13] you say, "Whoa, what? That's big." Let
[59:15] me read you what the prophet said. How
[59:17] many believes the words of the prophet?
[59:20] &gt;&gt; We in agreeance where two or three are
[59:22] in agreeance.
[59:25] God looking through the blood. He
[59:29] doesn't see you no more as a sinner. He
[59:32] sees you redeemed.
[59:35] You're redeemed because he always sees
[59:38] you through Christ. That's the reason we
[59:41] can be perfect. Thank you.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Woo. That's that's rich. That's the
[59:47] reason we can BE PERFECT. NOT PERFECT IN
[59:52] the sense of sinners. We're perfection
[59:55] in the eyes of God when we're in Christ.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; So what you identify with in this hour
[1:00:08] says a lot about who you are.
[1:00:11] What you identify with lets people know
[1:00:13] what you think. You know, brother
[1:00:14] Brandham said, "You show me what you got
[1:00:16] in your living room, what's on your
[1:00:17] coffee table, whatever. I can tell you
[1:00:19] what kind of, you know, let me tell me
[1:00:21] who you hanging out with. I can tell you
[1:00:23] what kind of person you are.
[1:00:27] So, what you identify with, what you
[1:00:29] associate with is going to tell the
[1:00:30] people a lot about how you're going to
[1:00:32] act. It's going to tell the people a lot
[1:00:35] about how you're going to treat other
[1:00:36] people that you come in contact with.
[1:00:38] It's going to tell the people a lot of
[1:00:40] stuff. So that's why our confession is
[1:00:42] so important because it's based upon our
[1:00:46] confession of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:49] and the association and the
[1:00:51] identification of living underneath that
[1:00:53] blood of Calvary. Listen to this. You'll
[1:00:57] never live above your confession.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the high priest of our
[1:01:04] confession. He can't do nothing until
[1:01:07] you first confess he's done it.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; If you need healing, but you don't think
[1:01:14] he's a healer and you can't confess he's
[1:01:16] a healer, you ain't getting healed.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; But if you confess it and you begin to
[1:01:22] associate with it and you begin to
[1:01:24] accept it, that's when God moves ON THE
[1:01:27] SCENE. HE SAYS, HE SAYS, "I'M NOT SAVED
[1:01:30] TONIGHT BECAUSE I get happy and shout."
[1:01:31] No, that isn't it. I'm not saved because
[1:01:33] of the gift of God works through me. No,
[1:01:36] I'm saved because I have met the
[1:01:38] conditions that Jesus Christ required of
[1:01:41] me. He says, I'm saved ACCORDING TO THE
[1:01:45] BIBLE AND NOT BECAUSE I feel like I'm
[1:01:48] saved.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to feel like
[1:01:52] we're saved, but we're not associating
[1:01:53] around the right crowd. Brother Ber,
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; people want to come to church AND SAY,
[1:01:58] "OH, I GO TO CHURCH HERE. I'M A
[1:01:59] CHRISTIAN." BUT THEY ASSOCIATE A WRONG
[1:02:01] AROUND the wrong crowds of people.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Show me who you associate with, I'll
[1:02:06] tell you what kind of life you're
[1:02:07] living.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; It's that simple.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; You know the old saying, if you if you
[1:02:14] lay with dogs, you're going to get
[1:02:15] fleas.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; You write that one down, Lauren.
[1:02:21] She writes down all my sayings because I
[1:02:23] got a million of them.
[1:02:27] She ain't never heard some Miss Kentucky
[1:02:29] lingo. we use.
[1:02:36] Listen now.
[1:02:37] Not because I feel like I'm saved. He
[1:02:40] says because Satan can whip you around
[1:02:42] the stump on your feelings.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Well, I'm I'm saved today.
[1:02:47] I feel good. I did you did you
[1:02:49] experience a joy in the service we had
[1:02:51] today?" Did you Have you ever been in
[1:02:53] such a service and then the next day
[1:02:55] Satan knocks you in the dirt?
[1:02:58] Well, I just don't know if I'm saved.
[1:03:01] IT'S NOT BASED UPON THOSE FEELINGS, BUT
[1:03:04] IT'S BASED, HE SAID, UPON THUS SAYAETH
[1:03:07] THE LORD. I'M SAVED. I'M GOING TO
[1:03:10] CONFESS THAT. I'M GOING TO believe I'm
[1:03:12] saved. Sitting here in my seat, I'm
[1:03:15] going to accept it. I'm going to begin
[1:03:16] to confess it. And I'm going to tell
[1:03:19] people I'm saved.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; How many we haven't saved?
[1:03:27] Say it. I'm saved.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; I'm saved.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; I never doubted you,
[1:03:34] but others might. He said, "See, the
[1:03:37] people said, there ain't no difference
[1:03:39] in you.
[1:03:41] Young people, you battle this a lot, and
[1:03:43] I know it. You come and you you feel
[1:03:46] like you get something from God. You
[1:03:47] feel like you're getting saved. You feel
[1:03:48] like, you know, the Holy Ghost. You're
[1:03:50] getting filled with the Holy Ghost." But
[1:03:51] people will look at you say, "N I don't
[1:03:53] see I don't see nothing.
[1:04:01] It's not about that.
[1:04:04] It's not about that. He said, "Keep your
[1:04:06] confession and watch it work
[1:04:09] righteousness."
[1:04:10] You keep saying, "I'm saved all of your
[1:04:14] neighbors and everybody will know you're
[1:04:17] saved because you believed it. YOU
[1:04:20] CONFESSED IT." WHY? WHAT HAPPENED? It
[1:04:22] changed you. HE'S THE HIGH PRIEST OF
[1:04:24] your confession, sitting at the right
[1:04:27] hand of the father, making good on WHAT
[1:04:29] YOU'RE CONFESSING. SO IF YOU SAY, "I GOT
[1:04:32] THE HOLY GHOST,"
[1:04:34] you're going to start living like you
[1:04:36] got the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I'm healed. YOU'RE GOING TO START ACTING
[1:04:42] like you're healed.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says. The same thing
[1:04:46] is about healing. You accept him as your
[1:04:49] healer. Renounce your feelings.
[1:04:55] You know, there's days when you're sick,
[1:04:57] and I'm talking big sick, cancers,
[1:05:00] heart issues, diabetes,
[1:05:03] lung issues. These issues are real
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; and they give you real real uh symptoms
[1:05:13] and your body begins to feel these
[1:05:15] symptoms. He said, "BUT YOU RENOUNCE
[1:05:17] THOSE FEELINGS.
[1:05:19] You don't tell people, "I don't feel
[1:05:21] good today."
[1:05:24] You renounce those feelings because it's
[1:05:27] by your faith. He says, "Say you're
[1:05:31] healed.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Believe you're healed.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Act like you're healed.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Now watch.
[1:05:46] associate with those who believe in
[1:05:50] healing.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; We got to have we got to have some faith
[1:05:56] built around us.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO HAVE SOME SOMETHING THAT LIFTS
[1:05:59] us up and makes us helps us to believe.
[1:06:01] When you have a hard time believing, I
[1:06:03] need people that can help believe for
[1:06:05] me.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; When the symptoms are more than I can
[1:06:08] bear, Brother Baller, I NEED YOU TO SAY,
[1:06:10] "YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN HEAL YOU. GOD'S GOING TO HEAL
[1:06:14] YOU. I BELIEVE for you, he said. And you
[1:06:17] get around those people and associate
[1:06:19] with those who believe in healing and
[1:06:21] God will bring you right out to a
[1:06:25] perfect soundness of health.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And he punctuates it with it will not
[1:06:35] fail.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; You see how important it is of what we
[1:06:42] associate
[1:06:45] You see,
[1:06:47] it goes both ways.
[1:06:50] Oh, you got to have the negative. If
[1:06:51] you're going to have the positive, you
[1:06:52] got to have the negative. If you're
[1:06:53] going to have the good, you got to have
[1:06:54] the bad. I'm sorry. That's just the way
[1:06:56] it works. That's the way preaching
[1:06:58] works. That's the way life works.
[1:07:01] You see, if you identify
[1:07:04] with sin and unbelief,
[1:07:07] if you find yourself identifying and
[1:07:09] associating with sin and unbelief,
[1:07:11] you're going to act like a sinner.
[1:07:15] You see, because unbelief will lead you
[1:07:17] down the road
[1:07:19] of alcoholism,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; drug addiction,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; tobacco abuse,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; pornography.
[1:07:27] That's right. It'll lead you down all
[1:07:29] these roads. It'll ruin your marriage.
[1:07:32] Unbelief will lead you to adultery and
[1:07:34] fornication.
[1:07:38] Unbelief,
[1:07:40] associating with the wrong crowd. Why is
[1:07:43] that? Because you're associating with
[1:07:45] the wrong spirit.
[1:07:49] He says, "What's the condition that the
[1:07:52] world's gotten into?"
[1:07:54] He said they got out here on the street
[1:07:55] and carry on and they stick their head
[1:07:57] in a television on Wednesday night and
[1:08:00] don't go to church.
[1:08:07] We running about twothird the numbers we
[1:08:09] are on Sundays. Brother Bo, tell me
[1:08:10] where they at.
[1:08:21] They won't go to church. Why?
[1:08:24] Listen now. But there ain't a kid in the
[1:08:26] country who don't know everything there
[1:08:28] is to know about Davy Crockett.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; You heard this quote before, had you?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And he says, "We tell him everything
[1:08:37] there is. We tell him a dirty lie saying
[1:08:39] he killed a bear at three years old. You
[1:08:41] know that's a lie." He said, "YOU KNOW
[1:08:44] IT'S A LIE." HE SAYS, "BUT YOU LET YOUR
[1:08:46] KIDS get their head all stuffed full of
[1:08:48] that." But yet there is isn't 1% of 100
[1:08:53] that ever know anything about Jesus.
[1:08:57] Now I got to thinking about this and I
[1:08:59] thought, you know what, we live in the
[1:09:01] Bible belt. We live in a in a in a in an
[1:09:04] area in the country when there's a
[1:09:06] church on every corner, some across the
[1:09:07] street from each other. And as one woman
[1:09:09] said, sometimes they even named the
[1:09:11] same.
[1:09:14] So to say our kids have not heard or the
[1:09:16] kids in this in this area have not heard
[1:09:18] of Jesus Christ is probably probably a
[1:09:21] far shot.
[1:09:23] But I've come to find out that the truth
[1:09:25] is that there are numerous people around
[1:09:28] the world and in the United States in
[1:09:30] our country that have never heard or
[1:09:32] don't even care to know a thing about
[1:09:35] Jesus Christ.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; They don't want to know.
[1:09:41] I seen this clip. This YouTuber, all he
[1:09:43] does is go around and ask people, "Do
[1:09:45] they know Jesus?"
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; "Do you know Jesus?" Leave me alone. "Do
[1:09:51] you know Jesus?" I don't want to talk
[1:09:52] about it. "Do you know Jesus?" You
[1:09:54] shouldn't ask me that. "Do you know
[1:09:56] Jesus?" You're too political.
[1:09:59] Over and over and OVER AND OVER, ONE
[1:10:01] AFTER ANOTHER AFTER another after
[1:10:03] another after another until one of them
[1:10:05] said, "Yes, I know Jesus."
[1:10:08] John 3:16. And he began to quote it. AND
[1:10:12] I THOUGHT ONE OUT OF HOW MANY DID HE
[1:10:14] HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO ONE PERSON?
[1:10:19] They don't want to associate around it.
[1:10:21] AND THE PROPHET SAID IS BECAUSE THIS
[1:10:23] WORLD HAS become so polluted.
[1:10:26] This world is associated with Satan.
[1:10:30] It's associated with selfishness. It's
[1:10:32] associated with meanness
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; and hate
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; and envy and entitlement.
[1:10:41] That's what the world is associating
[1:10:43] with in this hour we're living in.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYBODY but
[1:10:50] themselves.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN I BENEFIT?
[1:10:56] Don't ask me about Jesus.
[1:11:03] This world has become SO POLLUTED. THIS
[1:11:05] NATION SO RIDICULOUS and so FAR FROM GOD
[1:11:08] THAT THEY HAVE REJECTED THE Holy Ghost.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; You say, "I go to church. I shout." You
[1:11:14] might do that. But until that gentle
[1:11:17] lamb of God settles down into your heart
[1:11:20] and cleans up your life and makes you
[1:11:22] act like a different person, it won't do
[1:11:25] you no good to impersonate Christ.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to this quote. I I
[1:11:34] I apologize if I if I got too many
[1:11:35] quotes tonight, but I hope you're
[1:11:36] enjoying it because these quotes really
[1:11:38] bless my heart. He's talking about the
[1:11:41] Isuza Street meetings and we know that
[1:11:43] and in the Isuza Street meetings, the
[1:11:44] the Holy Ghost fell and it was the found
[1:11:46] it was the the birth of Pentecostals and
[1:11:48] and the Pentecostalism, but not the
[1:11:51] Pentecost that we know of today. Not the
[1:11:54] Pentecostal movement that we see all
[1:11:56] over YouTube and the dancing and
[1:11:58] shouting and and 40,000 women on the
[1:12:00] stage all having a microphone singing
[1:12:02] and dancing. That's not what it was
[1:12:04] talking about. But the Isuza Street
[1:12:06] meetings when the Holy Ghost fell, he
[1:12:08] said those people got together. And when
[1:12:10] Christ come down amongst those people, I
[1:12:12] want you to watch the character that was
[1:12:14] in those people. HE SAID THEY WERE
[1:12:17] GENTLE.
[1:12:19] They were peaceful.
[1:12:22] They lived godly lives.
[1:12:25] They lived sacrificial lives.
[1:12:29] They were willing to give in.
[1:12:32] They were willing to be led by the Holy
[1:12:36] Ghost.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; You see, so many times we surround
[1:12:42] oursel with churchism.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Churchism.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; I go here, I go there. This is my
[1:12:49] pastor. That's my pastor. And I go here,
[1:12:52] and I give here, and I gave that, and I
[1:12:54] did this. Churchism.
[1:12:56] And all along are they sitting there
[1:12:58] with just being a part of the system
[1:13:03] or are they a part of the movement?
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; I want TO BE A PART OF THE MOVEMENT. I
[1:13:08] WANT TO BE A PART OF JESUS CHRIST MOVING
[1:13:10] IN MY LIFE, MOVING IN YOUR LIFE, IN MY
[1:13:12] CHILDREN'S LIFE, IN THE CHURCH'S LIFE.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT we're looking for.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; They didn't care if people called them
[1:13:22] crazy.
[1:13:24] They didn't care if people called them
[1:13:25] old-fashioned.
[1:13:27] They didn't CARE WHAT CAME THEIR WAY,
[1:13:29] BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO be led by the
[1:13:31] Holy Ghost. He said, "But now watch
[1:13:35] these powder puffs."
[1:13:38] Uh-oh.
[1:13:39] Remember I said there's a good and a
[1:13:40] bad. There's a
[1:13:42] Watch these powderpuff makeup box short
[1:13:46] on in the street. What a disgrace.
[1:13:49] He said, 'WHEN THEY CALL themselves with
[1:13:52] the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:55] Have you ever noticed that
[1:13:59] they call themselves with I I got
[1:14:02] anointed with the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:07] He says, "Why? It's such a disgrace."
[1:14:09] You say, "But I spoke in tongues." Yes.
[1:14:11] And the devil does, TOO.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I SHOUTED. YES. And the devil does, too.
[1:14:16] The devil can impersonate everything
[1:14:18] that God's got except love.
[1:14:22] SO HERE NOW WE SEE WE GET TO WATCHING
[1:14:24] out here what's going on out in the
[1:14:27] world. And they're constantly I got the
[1:14:29] Holy Ghost. I got this. I got the Holy
[1:14:31] Ghost. I got the Holy Ghost. And the
[1:14:33] next thing you know, we see worship
[1:14:37] like you can't imagine.
[1:14:40] First thing you know, listen now, this
[1:14:43] is not this is not I'm not harping at
[1:14:44] you, but I'm just I'm just showing you
[1:14:46] how how quick things can go south.
[1:14:51] First thing you know, you get started
[1:14:52] doing these things and you've let down
[1:14:54] the bars.
[1:14:56] You begin to compromise.
[1:15:02] You begin to compromise. How many don't
[1:15:05] show your hands, but think in your mind.
[1:15:06] How many has ever compromised
[1:15:10] around the word?
[1:15:14] I could be honest and say I probably
[1:15:16] have more than once.
[1:15:19] I what if I what if this? What if? Maybe
[1:15:24] it don't. Maybe it does.
[1:15:27] You know what I'm talking about?
[1:15:30] So, we can't be compromisers.
[1:15:33] We have to find ourselves filled with
[1:15:35] the Holy Ghost to where the compromise
[1:15:36] is taken out. He says, "But they begin
[1:15:39] to compromise and then the church,"
[1:15:41] watch how this just pollutes
[1:15:43] all based on compromising on the word.
[1:15:48] They compromise and the next thing you
[1:15:50] know, you get little clicks amongst
[1:15:52] them.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you get these little clicks
[1:15:57] amongst you. And this one will say,
[1:16:01] "Pastor did this.
[1:16:03] Deacons done this."
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; First thing you know,
[1:16:13] because you're in a compromised state,
[1:16:17] because you're in a compromised state,
[1:16:19] first thing you know, you listen to that
[1:16:26] What we need is people to stand up and
[1:16:28] say, "I don't know who you're talking
[1:16:30] about, but you're not going to be
[1:16:31] talking about my pastor that way."
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; If you've got a problem, you need to go
[1:16:37] see him.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me. Don't tell nobody else.
[1:16:41] If you've got an issue, you go talk to
[1:16:43] him about the issue.
[1:16:46] That's free.
[1:16:49] He says, "You've listened to that and
[1:16:51] you find yourself, you get into so much
[1:16:53] trouble because you begin to listen to
[1:16:55] that devil and you get a snarl instead
[1:16:58] of the dove Holy Spirit, the dove of God
[1:17:02] that would lead you and guide you and
[1:17:04] love you and bless you." Huh? First
[1:17:08] time. Listen now, brothers and sisters.
[1:17:10] Hey, we we beating rubbers meeting road
[1:17:13] tonight.
[1:17:15] THE FIRST TIME you get one of them
[1:17:16] little temper spasms,
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; you know what happens?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; The dove flies away.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. She can't stand it. She
[1:17:41] can't stand it. Her nature is different.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, she can't stand it at all. AND YOU
[1:17:47] GO TO TALKING ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBOR, she
[1:17:50] can't stand it.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; She just won't put up with it.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Help us, LORD.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; HELP ME, LORD. HELP US, LORD. How many
[1:18:02] would say that? Help us, Lord.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; THAT WE DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THESE
[1:18:07] SITUATIONS BECAUSE WE FOUND OURSELVES IN
[1:18:09] a in a state of compromise.
[1:18:16] He just can't stand it any longer and he
[1:18:18] takes his flight because that dove is
[1:18:20] gentle. The dove is meek. The dove can't
[1:18:23] stand nothing unless it's the same kind
[1:18:26] of nature. Why is that? He was smitten.
[1:18:32] Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; That nature
[1:18:35] was pulled out and given to you as a
[1:18:38] gift
[1:18:39] under the shed blood of Calvary,
[1:18:47] but we want to get all wolf nature.
[1:18:51] Let me tell you, if they sing that song
[1:18:54] again,
[1:18:58] if he PREACHES ONE MORE TIME LIKE THAT,
[1:19:03] if that deacon EVER CORRECTS MY CHILD
[1:19:06] LIKE THAT AGAIN,
[1:19:15] hair standing up, bristled up, fangs
[1:19:18] out, claws out. Hi.
[1:19:23] You say, "Well, I'm not that bad." Well,
[1:19:24] maybe you're just a goat.
[1:19:29] Always butting against everything.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; I don't like this. I'm going to butt
[1:19:33] against it.
[1:19:35] I'm going to butt against it.
[1:19:38] But you see, God, you say, you say, "How
[1:19:42] can how can I, if I've got this nature,
[1:19:44] how do I overcome this nature?
[1:19:47] How do I overcome?" BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
[1:19:48] we're here for. We're here to overcome
[1:19:50] our problems. We're here to overcome
[1:19:52] these negative things. We're here to
[1:19:54] overcome that wolf nature, that goat
[1:19:56] nature. THAT IS OUR DESIRE TO GET THAT
[1:19:59] GENTLE, SWEET, meek dove, lamb nature.
[1:20:03] How do I do it? How do I do it, brother
[1:20:05] Brandham? He said, God can make you a
[1:20:08] different man and a different woman by
[1:20:10] nature. He can give you a DIFFERENT
[1:20:12] NATURE. WELL, BROTHER BRANDHAM, WHAT CAN
[1:20:14] WE DO ABOUT IT?
[1:20:17] OH, all ears.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Now, this is pretty deep and pretty
[1:20:22] difficult. So, you listen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; What can we do about it?
[1:20:27] Just become a lamb again.
[1:20:35] Just become a lamb again.
[1:20:38] Just take another trip to Calvary.
[1:20:40] Just take another trip under the shed
[1:20:42] blood of Calvary. Get yourself under
[1:20:45] that under that BLOOD AND CONFESS, LORD,
[1:20:48] I'M NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE. LORD, THIS IS
[1:20:50] NOT THE KIND OF NATURE that I want IN MY
[1:20:52] LIFE. LORD, I WANT TO BE LIKE YOU, NOT
[1:20:54] LIKE THE DEVIL.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Find yourself under Calvary.
[1:21:01] He said, "And if you are a become a
[1:21:04] goat,"
[1:21:06] now he ain't talking about the greatest
[1:21:07] of all time. Not that kind of goat. Not
[1:21:11] the Michael Jordan kind of goat.
[1:21:14] But if you find yourself are becoming a
[1:21:16] goat, then get that old goaty spirit off
[1:21:19] of you.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's it's it's it's this
[1:21:25] is I want you to remember it this way.
[1:21:28] It's miserable being miserable.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; It's miserable to be miserable.
[1:21:38] THAT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING
[1:21:40] OR THE CHURCH DOES THIS OR DOES THAT,
[1:21:42] YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO R UP
[1:21:44] AGAINST. BROTHER, I don't know why we're
[1:21:46] going this way, but
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; get that goat nature out.
[1:21:54] It's important what we identify with.
[1:21:57] Let's get off of that. You know, if
[1:22:00] you're a woman, you identify as a woman,
[1:22:03] you act like a woman.
[1:22:05] If you identify as a man, you'll act
[1:22:07] like a man. I think we all here got that
[1:22:10] right. The world's got it backwards. We
[1:22:12] have men who identify as women. And what
[1:22:14] do they act like?
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Sissies.
[1:22:19] We got women who IDENTIFY AS MEN. WHAT
[1:22:21] DO THEY act like?
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; They swell up like a I don't I'm
[1:22:27] thinking
[1:22:31] just let's just move on. AMEN.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; IF YOU IDENTIFY AS AN OUTLAW, YOU'RE
[1:22:36] GOING TO BE A LAWB BREAKER. BUT PRAISE
[1:22:39] BE TO GOD. IF YOU IDENTIFY AS A
[1:22:41] CHRISTIAN, YOU'RE GOING TO ACT LIKE
[1:22:43] CHRIST ACTED. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING
[1:22:45] TO DO. AND IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER. OH,
[1:22:49] brother brother Brandham tells he said,
[1:22:50] "Oh, I went to the library when I was
[1:22:52] about 12 years old." And he said, "I got
[1:22:54] a book there and it was called The Lone
[1:22:56] Ranger."
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I RODE MY MAMA'S broom handle.
[1:23:03] I rode my mama's broom handle to death.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Thinking I was the Lone Ranger.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I went back and I got a
[1:23:12] book called Tarzan and the Apes."
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I took my mama's rug that was
[1:23:18] in front of the stove, I think he said."
[1:23:20] And he said, "I cut that thing up, made
[1:23:21] him a I guess a loin cloth, and he said,
[1:23:24] "I slept in the trees because I was
[1:23:27] Tarzan."
[1:23:30] Y'all laugh because y'all done the same
[1:23:32] thing.
[1:23:34] I was a rrestler. I was Conan the
[1:23:37] barbarian. I was you name it.
[1:23:42] I had a sword.
[1:23:58] I slept up in the trees.
[1:24:02] He said, "But one day,
[1:24:06] one day," HE SAID, "ONE DAY I GOT A HOLD
[1:24:09] OF SOMETHING THAT WAS REAL. ONE DAY I
[1:24:11] GOT A HOLD OF SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT
[1:24:13] FAKE, THAT WAS NOT NOT FICTION, BUT IT
[1:24:15] WAS TRUTH." AND HE SAID, "THAT ONE DAY,
[1:24:17] IT WAS JESUS CHRIST THAT I FOUND WAS
[1:24:20] REAL. And that Jesus Christ could do
[1:24:22] real THINGS IN MY LIFE. AND I HAVE ONLY
[1:24:24] WANTED TO BE WHAT JESUS WANTED ME TO BE.
[1:24:28] I'M GOING TO ACT like Jesus.
[1:24:36] You see, when the Holy Ghost on the
[1:24:38] inside, when you get the Holy Ghost on
[1:24:40] the inside, it identifies back to the
[1:24:42] life of Christ and and you begin to act
[1:24:45] like the real Holy Ghost fil son and
[1:24:47] daughter of God.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; There ain't no put on.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. But when that Holy Ghost
[1:24:53] is on the inside and you begin to
[1:24:56] identify yourself upon your confession
[1:24:58] that I'm a believer,
[1:25:02] you're going to do what believers do.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; You're going to act like believers act.
[1:25:06] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE FAITH LIKE
[1:25:08] BELIEVERS HAVE.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK THE WORD LIKE
[1:25:12] BELIEVERS SPEAK. YOU'RE GOING TO QUOTE
[1:25:13] THE QUOTES THE WAY BELIEVERS QUOTE THE
[1:25:16] QUOTES. YOU GOING to be everything that
[1:25:19] the believer would ever be.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; We got a term that we hear a lot. It's
[1:25:29] called guilty by association.
[1:25:33] Guilty by association.
[1:25:37] You know, we we underestimate a lot of
[1:25:39] time and we discredit who we really are.
[1:25:43] And we allow Satan to whisper in our
[1:25:44] ears, "You're not a believer.
[1:25:48] You're not good enough.
[1:25:51] Look at everybody else. Look how much
[1:25:53] better they are. You don't see them in
[1:25:55] their house.
[1:25:57] You don't see them in their car.
[1:26:03] Quit looking at people and look to
[1:26:08] Christ.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Look to Christ.
[1:26:12] Guilty by association. We underestimate.
[1:26:15] You know, a lot of times as ministers,
[1:26:18] brother Balor, myself, other ministers,
[1:26:20] we get asked questions a lot. We get
[1:26:22] asked personal private questions. And
[1:26:26] one of the things that I get asked a lot
[1:26:28] or or it comes up is that people will
[1:26:30] say, "I want the Holy Ghost, but I have
[1:26:34] these thoughts."
[1:26:39] How can I have the Holy Ghost when these
[1:26:40] thoughts come up? How can I have the
[1:26:44] Holy Ghost? I'M TRYING TO DO GOOD. HOW
[1:26:46] CAN I HAVE the Holy Ghost when when I
[1:26:48] have a desire that rises up in my life?
[1:26:52] Everybody take your right hand.
[1:26:55] Grab yourself right here. Now squeeze.
[1:27:00] That's called flesh.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; That's called flesh.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; You see, your flesh is not perfect.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Your flesh is not going to be perfect.
[1:27:10] We're still IN THESE EARTHLY BODIES. WE
[1:27:13] STILL HAVE TO OVERCOME DAY AFTER DAY
[1:27:15] after day
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; the temptations and the thoughts that
[1:27:20] come through our mind. Why do you think
[1:27:22] the PROPHET PREACHED THE GREATEST BATTLE
[1:27:24] EVER fought was where? Here.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't say the greatest battle ever
[1:27:29] fought was in the heart.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; No. Why? Because once you get under THE
[1:27:34] BLOOD OF CALVARY AND YOU GET SEALED
[1:27:35] AWAY, they nothing going to PENETRATE
[1:27:38] THAT HEART.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; YOU may have thoughts.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You may have desires.
[1:27:45] You may say, "How in the world? How
[1:27:47] could this be ple how could I ever be
[1:27:48] pleasing to God with the kind of
[1:27:50] thoughts I have going on in my mind?"
[1:27:52] But listen to guilty by association. I
[1:27:54] want you to listen to this definition.
[1:27:56] It's the idea that a person is to blame
[1:27:59] for a crime or wrongdoing based solely
[1:28:01] on their connection to someone who's
[1:28:03] guilty.
[1:28:06] I may have had a thought to cheat
[1:28:07] somebody,
[1:28:10] but I didn't do it.
[1:28:12] Satan's the cheater.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; I may have had a thought to lie about
[1:28:17] something, but I didn't do it.
[1:28:21] Satan's a liar.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Now, under years and years ago, you
[1:28:28] would have been guilty by association.
[1:28:30] You thought the thought, you you
[1:28:32] envisioned a thought.
[1:28:35] Maybe maybe he's telling you to look at
[1:28:37] stuff you shouldn't look at. You didn't
[1:28:38] do it.
[1:28:40] He He's the pervert.
[1:28:44] But thank the Lord that the Supreme
[1:28:46] Court says legally, listen to this, a
[1:28:48] person is not guilty simply because they
[1:28:51] are associated with a criminal.
[1:28:54] If Satan comes knocking on your door,
[1:28:58] we know him. Don't you know him? I know
[1:29:00] him.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; I don't want to know him. I don't like
[1:29:04] him. I don't like him when he comes
[1:29:05] knocking. But, you know, from time to
[1:29:07] time, he knocks on my door.
[1:29:14] Why we get quiet when we talk about
[1:29:15] this? We're human beings, people.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Let's be real.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; HE KNOCKS ON MY DOOR. He knocks on your
[1:29:22] door. He knocks on everybody's door in
[1:29:24] here with some kind of thought,
[1:29:25] TEMPTATION, OR DESIRE THAT YOU WISH YOU
[1:29:28] never had.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; But you're not the guilty one.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE GUILTY ONE. HE'S THE ONE THAT
[1:29:38] CARRIED OUT THE ACT. HE'S THE ONE THAT
[1:29:40] WENT THROUGH WITH IT ON the in heaven on
[1:29:42] that day and when when thirds of an
[1:29:44] angel come down and fell with him. HE'S
[1:29:46] THE GUILTY ONE. BUT I'M NOT GUILTY
[1:29:48] because the blood says
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE REDEEMED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE
[1:29:55] it in the first place.
[1:30:04] Brother Brandham says, "I'm gonna have
[1:30:06] to hurry now. We got a great a great day
[1:30:09] of typology."
[1:30:11] Typology. I like those words he comes up
[1:30:13] with.
[1:30:15] If you don't believe it, paint your
[1:30:18] steps red next week and watch week after
[1:30:20] next. Your neighbors ain't got their
[1:30:22] steps painted red.
[1:30:25] He said, "Go to church with a new kind
[1:30:27] of hat on." I like this because he talks
[1:30:30] he talks my my kind of language.
[1:30:33] No matter how freaky it looks, the
[1:30:36] neighbor next to you don't try to get
[1:30:38] the same kind of hat and say, "Where'd
[1:30:39] you get that at?"
[1:30:44] No matter what it looks like.
[1:30:47] Where'd you get that at?
[1:30:49] He said, "If you if you drive a Plymouth
[1:30:52] after you've been driving a Ford, watch
[1:30:54] and see. Your neighbor don't want a
[1:30:56] Plymouth. man, they want something to
[1:30:59] match one another. And they said, I
[1:31:00] ALWAYS SAID I DIDN'T CARE IF MY TROUSERS
[1:31:02] MATCH my coat and my coat match my tie.
[1:31:05] But what I do want is my experience to
[1:31:08] match the word OF GOD AND WHAT GOD SAYS.
[1:31:11] That's why I SAY QUIT LOOKING AT OTHER
[1:31:13] PEOPLE. LOOK TO CALVARY.
[1:31:18] He said, ' If those people on the day of
[1:31:20] Pentecost got the Holy Ghost and they
[1:31:21] staggered and they shouted and he said
[1:31:24] they went out into the streets and they
[1:31:25] done miracles and and they acted like A
[1:31:27] BUNCH OF MANIACS, that's the kind of
[1:31:29] experience I want. You say, "Well, that
[1:31:32] scares me. I don't know if I want to act
[1:31:33] that way.
[1:31:36] I just want to do what he asked me to
[1:31:38] do." Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes God, in order to be
[1:31:43] in the will of God, the perfect will of
[1:31:45] God, sometimes you have to get your out
[1:31:47] of your comfort zone,
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; you have to get the get the the the the
[1:31:53] pain and the the fear of what your flesh
[1:31:56] feels
[1:31:57] out of the way.
[1:32:06] Brother Brandham's talking about he goes
[1:32:08] into
[1:32:10] he goes down into Los Angeles and he
[1:32:11] said this was the first time he ever got
[1:32:13] in in came in contact with the
[1:32:15] Pentecostal people out in California.
[1:32:18] And he said they wanted to tour him
[1:32:19] around and they wanted to take him to go
[1:32:21] see the the the burial place or the the
[1:32:23] place where Amy Simp S simple
[1:32:25] McFersonson was was buried. And so they
[1:32:28] take him out there and he said he's
[1:32:30] walking around. He's looking. He play
[1:32:31] paid his respect to to her in this uh
[1:32:35] morg or whatever whatever we would call
[1:32:37] it. I don't know it's not a morg but a a
[1:32:39] memorial area I guess. And he said as he
[1:32:42] walked through there he said one of the
[1:32:43] most outstanding things he saw when he
[1:32:44] entered on the east side of that door
[1:32:46] was a statue of Moses.
[1:32:49] And he said there was a statue of Moses
[1:32:51] right there. And he said it was told the
[1:32:53] guide told me that it was the the
[1:32:55] capstone. It was the cap of
[1:32:58] Michelangelo's
[1:33:00] life's work was when he carved out the
[1:33:03] image of Moses and it was the greatest
[1:33:06] masterpiece that Michelangelo had ever
[1:33:08] made. He said, "But then I noticed,
[1:33:13] I believe it was on the right knee." He
[1:33:15] said, "That statue looked perfect.
[1:33:19] That statue looked perfect. It was
[1:33:22] smooth." And and there stood Moses with
[1:33:25] the tables of laws in his arms.
[1:33:28] And he said what it was. He was standing
[1:33:30] there with the laws in his hands and his
[1:33:32] long beard. Now this was the mental
[1:33:35] conception of Michelangelo.
[1:33:38] He said Michelangelo didn't have a
[1:33:40] picture to go off of. He didn't have
[1:33:41] none of that. He was only going off what
[1:33:43] his mind told him that Moses would have
[1:33:46] looked like.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "And as the story goes and the
[1:33:49] statue got finished, it was rubbed all
[1:33:51] perfectly and smooth. And Michelangelo
[1:33:53] stands back at it.
[1:33:58] Come on.
[1:34:00] You gonna set up front. You gonna get
[1:34:01] you gonna participate, right? So, you're
[1:34:03] a statue.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Give me your tablets. All right. So, now
[1:34:07] Michelangelo,
[1:34:09] can you imagine him walking around
[1:34:12] looking at this image of perfection?
[1:34:18] He's looking at this image of
[1:34:20] perfection.
[1:34:22] It's smooth
[1:34:26] and he's just taking it all in.
[1:34:30] Look at this. Perfection.
[1:34:35] Perfection.
[1:34:37] And he's walking around looking over and
[1:34:39] over, checking it out.
[1:34:41] It's absolutely
[1:34:43] perfect.
[1:34:46] And he gets so inspired.
[1:34:49] He gets so inspired that what the very
[1:34:51] thought of his mind of what perfection
[1:34:53] was. He's so inspired that he looks AND
[1:34:56] HE THINKS BANG SPEAK.
[1:35:01] You can have your seat.
[1:35:06] It was such a perfect image in his mind
[1:35:09] that HE HE THOUGHT THIS THING OUGHT TO
[1:35:11] BE IT'S SO PERFECT IT SPEAK to us. So he
[1:35:13] hits it AND KNOCKS A CHIP off of the
[1:35:16] right knee
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; with the hammer.
[1:35:22] He smoteed it.
[1:35:24] Moses was now smitten by Michelangelo
[1:35:28] with a hammer because he was so inspired
[1:35:31] by the perfection that he saw.
[1:35:35] I hope you're picking up what I'm
[1:35:36] putting down.
[1:35:40] There was something on the inside of
[1:35:42] him. He said there was something on the
[1:35:44] inside of him at the beginning. HE DREW
[1:35:46] A MENTAL PICTURE IN his mind of what he
[1:35:48] thought Moses should look like. And now
[1:35:51] after all this time, years and years and
[1:35:54] years, he could see that the thought
[1:35:56] that HE HAD IN HIS MIND BEGIN TO reflect
[1:35:58] before him. Exactly what he had seen
[1:36:01] years and years and years before.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; He seen the reflection.
[1:36:12] And he says, brother Brown says, ' And I
[1:36:13] got so inspired.
[1:36:16] I GOT SO INSPIRED BY THAT BECAUSE I
[1:36:18] THOUGHT that the reality of it was the
[1:36:21] mark on the leg is what made it to me
[1:36:24] the masterpiece.
[1:36:30] Speak.
[1:36:33] That was the masterpiece because brother
[1:36:36] Brandham began to see and he be to take
[1:36:38] and he be to put it in perspective of
[1:36:40] what HE COULD SEE THAT DOWN THROUGH TIME
[1:36:42] mo here was Moses
[1:36:45] down through time Moses is standing
[1:36:47] there with the tablets perfect but he
[1:36:50] was smitten.
[1:36:52] And when we begin TO SEE WHAT GOD HAD
[1:36:54] DONE WITH JESUS in our day,
[1:36:59] HE PUTS JESUS UP THERE AND HE BEGINS to
[1:37:01] look at him and he begins to look at the
[1:37:03] life that Jesus had be down through time
[1:37:06] all from the days he was on the face of
[1:37:08] the earth and he says, "This man is
[1:37:10] perfect.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; There is not a flaw in his life.
[1:37:17] He's never done wrong. He's never said a
[1:37:20] bad word. He's never had a bad thought.
[1:37:22] He's never said said anything about
[1:37:24] anybody.
[1:37:26] Are you with me? Jesus is perfect down
[1:37:30] through time because we look and we see
[1:37:32] that down through time Moses failed.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Abraham failed.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; David
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; failed and failed miserably.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; They failed at perfection.
[1:37:52] But now Jesus comes.
[1:37:55] NOW JESUS CAME TO REFLECT the father. He
[1:37:58] said and the father was the word. He
[1:38:00] said he came to reflect the father's
[1:38:02] WORD. AND HE GOD SAID he would be there.
[1:38:04] And there he was. The perfect
[1:38:06] masterpiece of God. THE MASTERPIECE of
[1:38:10] God. His very handiwork
[1:38:17] from the days of the Garden of Eden.
[1:38:22] He reflected. Listen to what he says. Oh
[1:38:25] my.
[1:38:27] He reflected everything that God had
[1:38:30] spoke of.
[1:38:34] In the beginning, God said, "Let there
[1:38:37] be light.
[1:38:38] Let there be fouls of the air. Let there
[1:38:40] be fish of the sea. Let there be a
[1:38:42] firmament."
[1:38:44] What was the what was he trying to get?
[1:38:47] Now let us make man in our image.
[1:38:55] He reflected what Adam said about him.
[1:38:59] He reflected all what all the prophets
[1:39:02] said about him. He reflected what all
[1:39:04] the patriarchs said about him.
[1:39:06] Everything he said, he was the
[1:39:07] fulfillment of the word and all types
[1:39:10] was fulfilled in him. Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; As Jesus comes on the scene in the New
[1:39:16] Testament,
[1:39:20] everybody up to that point
[1:39:24] fail, fail, fail, fail.
[1:39:29] And as Jesus comes into the Old
[1:39:31] Testament, watch what he says. He said
[1:39:33] HE WAS THE OLD TESTAMENT JEHOVAH,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; the word then which was the pillar of
[1:39:39] fire. He was made manifest and dwell
[1:39:42] amongst us. Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:39:45] became Jesus of the New Testament.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; He became Jesus of the New Testament. HE
[1:39:51] WAS A PERFECT REFLECTION OF GOD.
[1:39:54] HALLELUJAH. A PERFECT REFLECTION of God
[1:39:57] that he CAME DOWN TO PERFECT everything
[1:40:00] that would have been lost before him.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that they didn't stand a
[1:40:05] chance?
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't stand a chance.
[1:40:10] Your children don't stand a chance
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; without that perfect reflection of God.
[1:40:18] He was absolutely perfect till he
[1:40:19] pleased the sculpture so much.
[1:40:24] Not Michelangelo this time.
[1:40:27] HE WAS SO PERFECT TILL HE PLEASED THE
[1:40:28] SCULPTOR SO much
[1:40:31] that he put him on Calvary
[1:40:36] for the entire world to see on display.
[1:40:39] perfection.
[1:40:42] The entire world looked up and saw
[1:40:45] perfection.
[1:40:50] The perfect masterpiece.
[1:40:53] THE PERFECT MASTERPIECE. NOW THERE FOR
[1:40:55] THE ENTIRE world to look at and to and
[1:40:58] to look at and say, "LOOK AT THIS. THIS
[1:41:00] IS Jesus Christ,
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; savior of the world, perfect in all
[1:41:06] manners.
[1:41:12] But he said, just like Moses being
[1:41:15] smitten on the leg,
[1:41:18] this was a man that was marred above all
[1:41:21] men.
[1:41:22] He was marred so much till they didn't
[1:41:24] even He didn't even look like the son of
[1:41:26] man. He was beaten. He was bruised. He
[1:41:30] was bloody. He was stripped. everything
[1:41:32] that could be done. He looked like a big
[1:41:35] pile of blood and bones walking
[1:41:38] together.
[1:41:40] He didn't even look human.
[1:41:48] As they drugg him up to Calvary,
[1:41:51] God smoteed him.
[1:41:54] Not for God, for us. Yeah,
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; it pleased God to know that he built a
[1:42:04] bride.
[1:42:06] that he was able to as Jesus was up ON
[1:42:09] THE CROSS ON CALVARY LOOKING LIKE A JUST
[1:42:11] A BIG PILE of blood and bones that he
[1:42:13] was able to reach in there and pull out
[1:42:14] of his side
[1:42:17] from the original creation.
[1:42:20] A bride
[1:42:22] that would look just like him,
[1:42:25] that would act just like him, that would
[1:42:28] talk just like him,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; that would pray just like him.
[1:42:34] everything she did would be just like
[1:42:37] him.
[1:42:40] 2,000 years. And I'm closing. 2,000
[1:42:43] years. He says, God has been trying to
[1:42:45] cut him a masterpiece bride called a
[1:42:49] church. That's right. How would God ever
[1:42:51] do it? How would he ever do it? It's by
[1:42:53] his neverchanging method, the word. He
[1:42:57] never changes his method. Nobody.
[1:43:00] Nobody. You can. You can change. I can
[1:43:03] change. Time changes. The world changes.
[1:43:06] But God never changes. He's perfect.
[1:43:13] He's perfect.
[1:43:16] He doesn't change. And he and the way he
[1:43:18] does anything the first time, he does it
[1:43:21] that way every time. The same way.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; He doesn't change.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. We got to
[1:43:31] close. Some of you's got long drives.
[1:43:36] I can be home in about two minutes. So,
[1:43:39] I can go for another hour if you want.
[1:43:44] But I just think about the perfection of
[1:43:46] God. And I'm brought back to that very
[1:43:48] statement that I made at that one
[1:43:50] service. Perfect became imperfect.
[1:43:53] A pool of blood and bones and marred and
[1:43:55] spit on and mocked and scorned.
[1:43:59] perfect became that because that's what
[1:44:02] I should have been.
[1:44:05] And when we realize that that we're the
[1:44:07] ones that should have been there, we
[1:44:08] should have been that pile of blood and
[1:44:10] bones.
[1:44:17] He says, 'Oh, if the church today, if
[1:44:20] the church today could just reflect that
[1:44:22] first church when the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:44:23] the day of Pentecost, if the Christians
[1:44:26] today could just reflect,
[1:44:30] How many tonight with your eyes closed,
[1:44:32] heads bowed, would just raise your hand
[1:44:34] to God and just say, "Lord,
[1:44:38] that's my heart's desire. I just want to
[1:44:40] be a Christian that could reflect what
[1:44:42] you are, Lord." in all manners of my
[1:44:45] life. I just want to be what you would
[1:44:47] have me to be. I want to be I want to be
[1:44:50] in that image that that is pleasing to
[1:44:51] you. I want the words that I speak to be
[1:44:54] pleasing to your ears. I want the songs
[1:44:56] that I sing to be pleasing to your ears.
[1:44:59] The things that my eyes view to be
[1:45:01] pleasing to your eyes
[1:45:03] because Lord, I realize that I was taken
[1:45:07] out of the side of my savior.
[1:45:10] that you've been building, you've been
[1:45:12] molding, you've been you've been shaping
[1:45:13] a bride down for thousands and thousands
[1:45:15] of years to be exactly what you would
[1:45:18] have her to be.
[1:45:20] You began in the garden, Lord,
[1:45:24] as you created out of the dust of the
[1:45:26] ground, Adam,
[1:45:28] the perfect creation.
[1:45:31] The perfect creation. And then and then
[1:45:33] the rib that was taken out, but it fell.
[1:45:37] Moses when he when Moses went be before
[1:45:40] the people and the people got to Moses
[1:45:42] and and he couldn't take it. He he just
[1:45:44] threw up his arms in disgust and he
[1:45:46] couldn't take it and he failed. Abraham
[1:45:48] when he was put to the test he lied
[1:45:52] said
[1:45:54] this is my sister Sarah twice.
[1:45:59] David.
[1:46:02] Oh Lord.
[1:46:04] David, a murderer, an adulterer.
[1:46:09] But there was the Christ. Thank you,
[1:46:11] Lord, for Jesus Christ.
[1:46:14] Thank you, Lord, for the blood that was
[1:46:16] shed.
[1:46:17] Thank you, Lord, for moving in our
[1:46:20] lives.
[1:46:22] So that when when we come to you with
[1:46:24] our faults and our failures,
[1:46:27] you don't look at that. You don't look
[1:46:28] at us as failures and and fault makers.
[1:46:31] You look at us through the through the
[1:46:33] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:46:35] and you look at us as redeemed.
[1:46:40] Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:43] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:46:49] Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:46:52] We're going to try this song tonight.
