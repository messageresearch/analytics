comes hungry and thirsty tonight God bless you thank you musicians I appreciate it amen that's a scripture that I want to read tonight amen and I thought it went along real well with that last song that we were singing amen so I say good evening to everybody it's good to be out on a midweek service amen good to see everybody at the post of Duty amen praise the Lord amen and so amen we're starting to sink into a little bit more of the winter weather now amen some of that 25 degrees in the morning amen I'm telling you what it's hard getting that bath when it gets that cold amen praise the Lord but anyway so God is good isn't he how many's looking forward to a good weekend amen how many's praying for the services amen we're certainly expecting and certainly looking forward to what the Lord will do amen amen you know we just don't count on man we don't look at man in all of this we look at the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is unlimited there's no telling what might happen what the Holy Spirit might do amen if we just come expecting amen amen come under anticipation amen amen and how do you come under anticipation well no doubt you've invested a little bit of time in prayer amen seeking the Lord amen because you know amen and saying Lord Jesus in this hour of Darkness gross Darkness amen we need all the light that we can get amen so I've prayed about it and tonight I want to try to I'm gonna take this down Donna you might have to turn it up a little GNA go down here so we don't have any real loud sound amen all right amen but if I want to amen take a certain section or a certain part of Sunday service amen that I really didn't go down the road that I wanted to kind of emphasize on I just kind of Amen kind of touched on it a little bit but I want to go a little bit deeper if i' be all right amen praise the Lord I'll tell you a what isn't that something how we've preached so many things on the new birth and what it means and then Sunday come up the Lord give it that amen every the whole world becomes amen a nightmare to the believer amen amen because and so amen God bless you let's just amen uh try not to go too long tonight but we'll just bow our heads and ask God's blessing upon the reading of the word Lord Jesus we come before you now Lord and as your Prophet taught us amen by example that any man can open the Bible and look at it and read the word and so forth but it does take you to really open the scriptures to us amen the understanding of the word Lord it takes your Holy Spirit Lord as we father just yield to you tonight we ask God that once again you'll just take thoughts meditation of our heart father that which we we feel God you've laid upon our heart to minister tonight Lord we just pray father you'll have your perfect way with it Lord say what you once said Lord do what you want to do Lord and we thank you Father that you do Lord we ask your blessing upon the reading of the word now in Jesus Christ's name am amen praise the Lord amen all right all right let's let's turn if you will and we'll just start amen with the one quote amen but we'll read the scripture first and then we'll read to one quote that I I wanted to go down a certain amen I'm fading out a little bit right Donna no okay let's go to St John 8 if you will let's do a little teaching lesson tonight right we'll try to anyway amen see sister Sarah's feeling better again so that's good amen I know Glenn and some of those are not feeling the best tonight so we just pray that they'll get over it real quick too amen amen chapter eight of St John and we'll read verse 21 then said Jesus again unto them I go my way and you shall seek me and shall die in your sins whether I go you cannot come what a depressing message What a Sad thing to have to hear from Jesus I'm gonna go away you're going to die in your sins and where I go you can't come wow there's not a whole lot of Hope in that is it no then said the Jews will he kill himself because he saith whether I go you cannot come and he said unto them ye are from beneath I am from above ye are of this world I am not of this world we got it this blessings to the reading of the word be seated amen our emphasis Sunday was Ben making the statement when we are born again we are of heaven and of God amen and we're citizens of the kingdom of God and the Holy Spirit that dwells there that comes in you to make you act and look and think as it does Amen in that Nation where we're going to amen and better of course was talking about Sweden he was talking about Germany he was talking about America and so forth and uh all these different nations that have all these different spirits Ain that right and then he was def finding our spirit and where we come from and and so forth amen and so we want to just with the help of the Lord emphasize on this a little bit and talking about spirits I titled this Spirits because amen I want to talk about different Spirits different Spirits many spirits and we know that we're made of three things Body Soul and spirit and we know that the spirit that we have you've heard the statement many times you know that Spirit drives them to do something how many knows that it's your spirit that drives you so we could say that the spirit that everybody has is your driver is that right the spirit that you have is your driver it's what makes you do the things that you do amen hey amen praise the Lord so amen praise God now let me just start saying this that first of all there are many many spirits that are evil and those Spirits are many many different they differ one from another is that right they're different Spirits a lot of different Spirits we want to deal with that I want to I want to I want to talk to you with the help of a little bit about how some of those Spirits how they come in and what it takes to get them out is that right what it takes to get them out how they come in uh you know and you have to watch them you have to watch Spirits man I'm telling you how many knows you you know how easy it is to cop a attitude man it's very easy to pick up a spirit amen but what I want to say about the other part is while there is many evil spirits there's only one good spirit there's only one holy spirit amen only one amen amen only one now few things I want to focus on I want to talk Unity oness of that Spirit we want to talk the power of that spirit amen and as I've said that Spirit how far comes in how it goes out and of course much much could be SP just as far as reading amen just you could read I could just sit here probably and read all night where Paul talk about you know that we are not in the flesh but in the spirit if you're not in the spirit not a child of God they that are the children of God are led by the spirit of God Amen many different things like that and if you uh uh are led by the spirit then you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen we covered a lot of that and I don't want to go so much maybe that way as perhaps just a few little new things that like the Lord showed me that I want to dwell on unless of course he decides down that road amen but in St John 17 St John 17 and I really like it folks F The more I've been begin to think about this uh you know about how that Jesus told them look I'm not of this world you're at home here but I'm not at home here right Jesus says you're from beneath I'm from above how many believe that you were from beneath but after the New Birth takes place you got a spirit from another country another home another place and you are driven by that spirit and if I can't say nothing else tonight I want you to know and I believe we can all say amen and that is that we need more of that Spirit young people have some Spirit about you have some Spirit about you have some Spirit about you have some Spirit about you brother John oh folks have some Spirit about you huh I mean we need to have some oh don't you just love to get up up here and preacher you ain't got no Spirit about it's all theological and it's all historical this that or the other I'll fall asleep we all like Spirit we all like to be alive amen you know that say that if the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead it will Quicken your mortal body and that Quicken me bring the [Applause] light folks said how many knows the Holy Ghost Li me up but I'm telling you what you know how many times I've sat in the tree stand and I almost went screaming Shou didn't care what it did to all my hunting stuff I was just huh you know I was thinking about how much and that this is one of the stories the Holy Spirit brings it to me so I'll go down this little Rabbit Trail or whatever one of the things I didn't tell you Sunday I wanted to tell you about how did a real believer you you hate to see things die don't you just hate death I hate death you know and and we wanted to get a few dos you know for good good meat in the freezer and so forth big old dough come right down there but awesome crosshairs I says Ah I have a hard time shooting masam I have a hard time doing it then done did two of them with the crossbow but man I I could go Zoom down there and pretty soon here comes three little ones and I have watched the mama and three little ones cross the road and here that Mama and the three little ones have almost become a part of us you know and I says I can't shoot the mama with three little ones all right but anyway there she was and I was still debating I says don't you come up here and smell me and bust me or I'll bust you but there she was they were going back and forth and oh my and the three little ones they all went in the creek and got a drink and come up out of there and all of a sudden them little ones went they jumping around and and man one little one just ran up the Ridge and ran back as hard as it could it was just having a do amen and pretty soon I seen the mama about and she get kicked up her heels and all of a sudden no two more had three little ones running back and forth in the rid ain't no in the world I can shoot a no Sor right you can't do it big old blast you know and take that Mama away from them and most of the time when you do that they all stand around and you know they're like who did this to my mom anyway I'm glad when it's all over with my granddaughter El I took I took her hunting a time or two and she almost got to shoot one she could have she would had it on dead on and so forth and I say let's just wait a little whatever and uh she says you know when we go hunting in heaven I said no we're not gonna shoot any big bucks and mount them on the wall she's pretty smart you know what she said she says yeah but maybe if the ERS fall off we can put a good one that's a good one if they change that maybe I don't know but oh my only she could come up with that right I hate that I hate to see all those animals don't you just hate them amen I believe one place the Bible says something about they that hate me love death amen if you hate God you love death amen I have a scripture here somewhere in because I wanted to talk to you a little bit about hate but it comes to my mind just now I'll just mention it no man can serve two masters for he will either hate the one amen how manyan know whenever you get the Holy Ghost me you get a little righteous hate hate that eats and Nick everything that's evil how many believes that when you become a Christian you hate everything that's evil he says ye that love the Lord hate amen hate evil in other places many other places I found where you know how the believer hates everything that's evil hated amen all right back to 17th chapter of St John we want to speak a little bit with the help of the Lord on on that one Spirit first of all that Unity that Oneness that the Holy Ghost brings amen and also in this scripture we'll find amen that we also are n of the world verse 11 chapter 17 of St John amen I kind of say it backwards don't I verse 11 chapter 17 know St John 1711 I don't know what it happens after 55 do that kind of say it backwards you don't even realize it amen that's all right when I get real old you're G to get real tired of me because I'll repeat myself repeat myself maybe I do already I don't hope so amen all right and now am I no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we [Applause] are how many believe that there's one thing the Holy Ghost does it it makes you one with God it makes you one with one another amen so he's Desiring that the same Oneness that he had with the father is the same Oneness you and I are to have with him not a whole bunch of different but all to be one while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scriptures might be fulfilled and now come I to thee and the things I speak in the world that there there that they might have my joy fulfilled them themselves I have given them Thy word and the world have hated them because they are not of the world world even as I am not of the world somebody give me a shout on that one that's right we're not of this world we're not of this world we're from another world how many believe that we have another [Applause] king oh people might man might think you the just old fashion this out of the other but what did Brother B say about that slave held up high don't worry about it amen walk around have some dignity about you because you have your amen your your father is the king of a tribe how many's glad that we have not just the king of a tribe but we've got the king of all trib the king of kings and Lord of lords is our that's amen did that settle in did that sink in the King of Kings is your king it's your dad screw the screw screw the pews down I don't want everybody fob them all over from running on them but that ought to do something for us am the king of all Kings is my dad stand proud amen you take me on you take him on praise the Lord as they are not of the world and I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but that thou should us keep them from the evil ain't that right I me know there evil everywhere there's Spirits everywhere every day you battle those Spirits you fight Spirits every day listen young Christians young CS you better keep your guard up that right keep your guard up because we're more susceptible a lot of times than those older folks have learned not to even let those thoughts entertain our mind is that right slightest little thing amen they are not of the world even as I am not of the world praise be to God I am glad to be from above and not from below praise the Lord how many knows that by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body and members in particular I mean believe that when you get baptized with the Holy Ghost you get baptized into a body the body of Christ there's one body body there's one Church there's one Lord there's one Faith there's one baptism and there's one mind I me there one mind let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus 1 Corinthians 1 chapter verse ah 10 I got it right this time now besee you bre by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and the same judgment how many believes that if you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost Paul said I can't hardly believe that there's divisions among you cuz Christ spirit is not divided if there's one reason we could dismiss the police force is because everybody's thinking the same thing we all got the same actions we all got the same Ambitions we all got the same goals be the same mind one mind they were all in one mind in one [Applause] Accord same thing Michael do you plan on going to hell where are you going that's the place I plan not good and we're one there that's right Dy how do you overcome how do you overcome through Christ that's right through the spirit I mean you ain't never going to overcome In the Flesh you Christ what's the way of baptizing you know I just don't differ with that at all I just want to% agree with that the Lord Jesus Christ amen we ought to have the same mind be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment amen didn't brother B say that man I'll tell you what if the people in Africa get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll make them act like we do when we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost over here the Holy Ghost makes his act the same way the works that I do shall you also amen praise be to God my that's right same thing tell you what right there's there problem there's a problem when somebody claims that they by the Holy Ghost say well not of days and miracles is passed there's no more Divine Healing that ain't the Holy Ghost talking now that it's a different Spirit talking talking there's a lot of different spirits in the world aren't you glad that you got the word to check every [Applause] Spirit then but said bride does not persecute bride so you got somebody persecuting somebody or somebody wanting to kill somebody somebody got the wrong [Music] Spirit it ain't the spirit of God bride does not persecute bride amen make Believers make Believers will persecute a real believer Jacob and Esau ain't that right if there's somebody that's a make believer ain't really got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen they'll actually persecute and try to kill the real Christians try to get rid of the real Christian that's a demonic devil oh my praise the Lord if you're born from above and you got the Holy Ghost so what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost now this is a trick question and I'm sure you could answer a lot of different ones I'm for you the Holy Ghost is Holy pry yeah it's called the Holy Ghost people don't believe in Holiness anymore man said you know all the church in there no Hol anymore without Holiness man shall see God if God is Holy and he's in you you're going to be holy you have a church oh I'm so glad that even Jesus not know this this spirit that we're talking about how many knows the spirit falls on us and that is considered water that we drink is that spirit that God gives down on it to you that's why we if you're thirsty come I will give you a drink I'll give you a drink of the Holy Ghost it'll make you it'll make you Quicken your mortal body it'll make an 80 year old man St up and kick his sh got to pray to God you ain't got enough room for me to preach up here he'll bring you life that's right we can old feeble havane will bring you to life that's what the spirit will do I me believe if you got to do anything but don't go through the motions first Spirit first if you want to be a Christian you'll never tell me just I wrote this just before I came out you'll never be able to turn you won't have the power to turn the other cheek unless you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you won't be able to to forgive people you'll be B if you ain't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you won't be able to forgive you ain't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost takes that is real power talking about power for just a minute amen that's what we need y'all can wait till Friday to have a Revival I'm gonna have it tonight I'm gonna start tonight is that all right I'm sorry I don't mean to lie I've been having a Revival and I'm just going to continue it not starting continue it aren't you glad you ain't got to wait till Friday for a good preacher to come in and and just get you all stirred up are you going to be this quiet Friday night are you going to get louder are we G to have more am don't be a hypocrite huh it's not a matter of time or who it's about a matter of the word of God whether it's the truth or not they that worship me are going to worship me and in truth praise the Lord you got to be in the spirit if you're going to worship Him amen that's what it takes truly be in the spirit be one another words another place Paul said in Philippians the 2 chapter verse 1 and two if there be any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any battles of Mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be like minded there it is again Paul sure love that you want to S it'll make us to think right it'll make us to think the same I got to tell you I I don't even have to teach you if you've got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost oh my teach you the same thing you know how many preachers are preaching and if you look at it and you see how much of the same it is yes Amen brother the time he wanted to give a testimony Sunday and I it slipped my mind and I didn't realize that he had a 15minute testimony he had told me and I forgot because I've got so much in my mind but he says man it would have went along so perfectly with the message how many we got to be likeminded because it has to be the same Spirit we've all lived long enough to know that when you get somebody with a different Spirit there's going to be problems there's going to be big problems if somebody got the wrong Spirit why do you think it's so important to keep the right spirit in the church amen keep the right spirit in the church because it doesn't matter how little it's wrong it's still wrong if it's a wrong spirit amen all right praise the Lord there is power in the name of Jesus how many knows now let's look at Power for just a minute comes to my mind didn't have write it down but I think it was St John 1 says ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you it's see that or in Acts amen after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you receive power let's go to Luke 8 Luke 8 I wanted to compare the power of Legion with the power of Samson because they were both bre Breaking Chains they were breaking ropes they were breaking feathers a't that right and they arrive verse 26 in the at the country of the Gans which is over against Galilee and when he went forth to uh to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had Devils a long time and wear no clothes you know what brother R said people stripping their clothes off the only one in the Bible ever stripped his clothes off had a bunch of Devils on them neither Abode in any house how manyan know Holy Ghost will make you put on clothes neither he live in a house but in tombs and when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with the loud boy said what have I to do with Jesus thou son of the god most high I beseech thee torment me not how many knows they got the tormenting coming for he had commanded the unclean Spirit to come out of him out of the man for often times it had caught him now these are parenthesis here caught him and had kept Bound in and was kept bound with chains and inets and he break the bands and was driven of the devil Into the Wilderness and Jesus asked him saying what is thy name and he said Legion I looked up how much Legion is Siri told me it's between 3,000 and 6,000 and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the de deep and there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffered them then went the Devils out of the man and went and entered into the swine and the her R ran violently down a steep Place into the lake and he jok how many knows another times uh he talked about how that he would cut himself and so forth a't that right now notice verse 35 and then they went out to see what was done and came to Jesus and found the man out of whom the Devils were departed sitting at Jesus feet clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid amen but said one place he says when you go into insane institution you'll find that people have lost their minds and so forth times there lot it takes a lot of people actually to handle them people they're many times stronger and amen I thought you know a Christian kind of loses his mind too and he becomes a lot stronger amen that this mind being you the carnal mind is em to be against Christ neither indeed can be but you got to have the mind of Christ you become much stronger amen if you have the mind of Christ now notice let's talk a little bit about spirits for a minute and how they enter in amen if you want to listen to a message I guess and I didn't even study this or look at it but I know know a lot of it amen

the devil gets in there and causes cancer if you aren't careful it'll eat you up he says the same way spiritually a lot of times when we when lot of time when we get a spirit on him amen most of the time it's because of trouble that comes our way a problem comes no matter what it is trouble oh all of a sudden I didn't expect this to happen and all of a sudden you get a temper oh oh there goes the devil huh or somebody does something to you that you don't like instead of forgiving you get bitter bitterness is the devil it's a devil and people get this they get that they get more and more and

nervousness huh see there's many ways that the Devils can come in to get on you quick I mean know every day you got to guard it am mean if you got you better guard it you better what something happens be careful don't let an attitude come in on you because that's where it all comes in at that's where it all starts at then it's from one to the other amen we think about what the devil drove the strength of this Legion and he could just rip chain off brother B says you know a devil when a devil gets on a person many times stronger than their strength people that are on crack or that some of

make you from a some kind of a quiet Church M tell everybody hey everybody you better repent world like Peter and them hiding up in room they're afraid of what they're gonna do to them after baptism the Holy Ghost they come up out of there they didn't care anymore what the devil's going to do they were ready to tackle the devil Jesus is still the Holy Ghost there's power in the Holy Ghost and only in the Holy Ghost if you're bound by I don't care what it is only the power of the Holy Ghost will break those bands I'm not going to go into it but s Samson you know when uh he didat those foxes

got a little bit of your blindness all of a sudden yeah yeah yeah yeah you got to invest some blood in it you got to have some family that's in it you got to be a part of it but you don't know nobody I don't know about you if I go to a ball game I don't bear it's kind of like come close to Super Bowl sometimes I like to watch a game or two but I can't really get into it cuz I got to say well do I want the red or the green which team do I want to for cuz I really ain't got a team to root for so as you know I'm not too enthusiastic about yeah yeah it's the team I've been waiting for and watching and I know the quarterback and I know the running back and I know every other back there is there injured how many months ago how many days ago and everything else and when want to get into that top why people go crazy huh but some people ain't got no investment in it I wonder sometimes if that's with it's Church problems sometimes we ain't got no investment in it we ain't never been really loose from those feathers we ain't never Holy Ghost break those [Applause] bands that's right preach it brother B amen God bless you you love him tonight God is good isn't he I thought about that look that Spirit didn't get time to go down it about we our Spirit our spirit is of another world tell me more about that spirit because the word is one thing ain't that right the letter kill us but the spirit brings life amen amen what controls the spirit your soul you know it's what seed you are that's soul is what lets the spirit in or don't let the spirit in amen praise the Lord my think about it he got

not very Unified no and you let a spirit of jealousy get on somebody like uh Putin huh or G well I want Ukraine look at all the dead bodies laying everywhere all because somebody wanted something some devil wanted something that's right now it doesn't matter what it is because we hate evil but sometimes that evil is in people and we don't hate people we love even our enemies but we hate that evil that's in them but you let jealousy get you let Envy get amongst them he says that's what causes Nations to go to figh with each other amen you know it be nice if the college professors go to college and tell the kids the truth that all these attitud and all these they're actually demons out of the pits of hell that are jumping on their hearts that are causing them to hate people amen even some of our smarter people are talking about the young people that hate America how can you hate your own house where you live not a lick a sense is it no but anyway let's not go there but it's just teach them what it really the truth is that they are driven by a spirit those professors are driven by a spirit to teach them things they oughtn't to teach them and cause them black lives matter one of the leaders I guess just the other day if you seen it in the news Endor Trump said the Dems really haven't done nothing for us we're going to we're going to uh uh be with Trump everybody was shocked
