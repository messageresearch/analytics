[40:37] goes beyond anything we could ever

[40:49] be rapture ready people resurrection
[40:51] ready people before we even took the
[40:53] breath of life or even before it was a
[40:54] body formed
[40:56] goes to speak for how deep and how
[40:58] wonderful is the grace of god
[41:01] i love him so much aren't you happy to
[41:03] be a christian tonight
[41:04] god bless you may be seated for a little
[41:06] bit if you'd like
[41:07] i
[41:08] want to thank you for your many prayers
[41:11] i know um
[41:14] i uh
[41:17] i stand here tonight certainly because
[41:19] of those prayers
[41:20] and the many people that prayed
[41:24] this is probably the second time in my
[41:26] life i've looked death right in the face
[41:28] and this is the second time
[41:30] that i've had the privilege of saying
[41:32] not yet the lord are done with me and i
[41:35] know that i have a purpose on this earth
[41:37] and
[41:38] coming through what i just come through
[41:40] over the past month month and a half
[41:42] i can promise you that whoever tells you
[41:44] or whoever says to me the covet is a
[41:46] myth i'm going to slap him as hard as i
[41:48] can hit him
[41:49] it ain't no myth it's a serious serious
[41:51] thing
[41:52] by the way brother tim i knew him i knew
[41:54] him very well i preached for him many
[41:56] times and
[41:58] matter of fact i was speaking to him the
[42:01] hour right before they put him on the
[42:02] ventilator and um
[42:05] just begging him please don't let him
[42:06] put you on that thing don't let him put
[42:07] you on that thing they was having to do
[42:09] it on a kind of they found blood clots
[42:11] in his lungs and
[42:13] you know we don't know i was thinking of
[42:15] it we don't know exactly
[42:18] why the lord will let this one stay and
[42:19] then take that one
[42:21] but this is why we trust the sovereignty
[42:23] of god
[42:24] because god knows exactly what he's
[42:26] doing
[42:26] he knows why he doesn't and our little
[42:29] puny finite minds we have no business
[42:32] nor do we have a right
[42:33] questioning his great authority and why
[42:36] he makes the decisions he makes
[42:38] and really if we would learn to follow
[42:40] him we'd be better christians all the
[42:41] way around sure would so i pray i
[42:44] appreciate your prayers it's a tough
[42:46] month but
[42:48] technically
[42:49] the doctor cleared me to get back on the
[42:51] road last week and i'm supposed to go to
[42:54] canada but
[42:55] you have to have a certain
[42:57] documentations of immunizations and
[42:59] different things going over and i fell
[43:01] short just a little bit of having
[43:03] everything i needed
[43:04] so i thought well
[43:07] you know i've been sitting around here
[43:08] since august let me think now
[43:11] my last meeting was with brother brooks
[43:13] i think that was the 27th 28th in iowa
[43:15] up there so i've been sitting around
[43:17] here since august 28th
[43:19] itching to kick the devil so i said lord
[43:21] you're gonna have to send me somebody
[43:23] that i can preach for and it wasn't just
[43:25] a few minutes after that but tom ramey
[43:27] can you come wednesday are you feeling
[43:29] all right to come wednesday so we're
[43:31] going to kick the devil for a little
[43:32] while
[43:34] amen
[43:35] now let me just warn you a little bit i
[43:38] don't have all of my strength back a
[43:40] hundred percent i get winded and my
[43:42] breath is a little short but if i have
[43:45] to slow down and preach a little slower
[43:47] tonight uh don't don't let that don't
[43:49] let that strike you as odd okay i'm just
[43:52] monitoring my health taking care of
[43:53] myself and and uh it's not really in the
[43:56] charismatic demonstration of jumping and
[43:58] hollering it's the word of the content
[44:01] of what we're saying anyways and then
[44:02] right and so we appreciate the lord and
[44:05] uh one sister said to me now i know why
[44:07] god gave you them powerful lungs so you
[44:09] could overcome this thing
[44:11] and i i got to laughing because when i
[44:13] come out of the hospital i couldn't
[44:14] hardly talk my lungs everything was so
[44:16] weak after about a week week and a half
[44:19] something like that i couldn't hardly
[44:20] even talk it i you know could hardly get
[44:22] my breath together
[44:24] and uh i i was listening to i think it
[44:26] was the gaither vocal band coming across
[44:28] facebook and they were singing one of
[44:30] them one of them old-fashioned gospel
[44:32] songs real upbeat you know and they're
[44:34] singing about going to heaven and the
[44:36] powers of god and you know and jesus can
[44:38] do anything and i thought you can touch
[44:41] these lungs in this voice right now and
[44:43] you know i started singing with them
[44:44] boys and my voice come right back the
[44:47] power come back right into my lungs and
[44:48] i was i was able to sing right on the
[44:50] spot and sing my wife looking at me she
[44:52] said you couldn't talk five minutes ago
[44:54] and i said that's right victory in jesus
[44:59] my savior forever
[45:02] amen so i'm going to attempt to sing i'm
[45:04] going to try this thing for the glory of
[45:06] god and then we're going to preach a
[45:08] little while now

[53:49] is wonderful to us and i i just wanted
[53:53] to pull if you're looking here at me
[53:55] tapping on my phone i had a quote come
[53:57] to my mind and i wanted to read this
[53:59] quote but i somehow failed to get it
[54:01] there
[54:02] but uh it's the first one i pull here
[54:04] jesus christ the same listen to this
[54:06] brother brahman said the word of god
[54:08] will defeat satan
[54:10] anywhere
[54:12] any time
[54:13] any place on any condition the word of
[54:16] god alone it is written
[54:18] will defeat satan he said now that is
[54:20] the truth the written word of god he
[54:22] said just like now he said it's going to
[54:25] hurt you he said but i'm responsible
[54:27] with god's word he said but now before
[54:31] amen he said it is written before satan
[54:34] could say anything to jesus
[54:36] he would hit him back with it is written
[54:39] it is written man shall not live by
[54:41] bread alone it is written he defeated
[54:44] satan
[54:45] on the word of god and every christian
[54:48] in here
[54:50] can defeat satan any place
[54:53] anywhere
[54:55] anytime
[54:56] on the word of god
[54:58] i like that
[54:59] that tells us brother that we don't have
[55:01] to be chickens we could be eagles
[55:04] and i want you to know tonight
[55:06] that god has not designated that you and
[55:09] i would be survivors
[55:10] you know i they were living in a time
[55:12] where
[55:14] it was somebody come through maybe a a
[55:16] great sickness say it's breast cancer or
[55:18] some kind of a thing
[55:20] and even even with covenant in this this
[55:22] time we're living in they come through
[55:24] it on the other side and they'll say i
[55:26] am a survivor of breast cancer i am a
[55:29] survivor of covet i'm a survivor of
[55:32] these different things what a little
[55:33] thought hit me the other day says
[55:35] i thought well if we're looking at it
[55:37] through the eyes of the word of god
[55:39] we're not survivors of any of this but
[55:42] jesus who died two thousand years ago
[55:45] over two thousand years ago my bible
[55:47] tells me that he wounded the head of the
[55:51] serpent
[55:53] now remember what the prophet of god
[55:54] said if you want to kill an animal don't
[55:57] cut his paw off
[55:59] are you with me
[56:01] amen don't feel sorry for me now i want
[56:03] you to preach with me a little while all
[56:05] right now now now notice if you want to
[56:07] kill a human being don't stab him in the
[56:10] leg amen if you want to kill something
[56:13] cut its head off and the effects of all
[56:15] that's with it will go once the head has
[56:18] been cut off amen the prophet tells us
[56:21] that satan that old serpent amen was
[56:24] wounded mortally at calvary where the
[56:27] very head of the devil was cut off amen
[56:31] that means he said sin
[56:33] sickness destruction
[56:36] famine peril sword anything that would
[56:39] accompany amen satan's unbelief and lie
[56:43] of unbelief against the word of god has
[56:45] already been defeated
[56:47] and placed at the feet of jesus christ
[56:50] and every believer i heard i read him
[56:51] say this the other day
[56:54] every believer he said that comes into
[56:56] the foot of calvary
[56:58] amen with that crimson blood
[57:00] falling upon the believer amen and once
[57:03] they are baptized into the body of jesus
[57:06] christ remember out of christ came three
[57:08] elements water blood life the only way
[57:11] to get back into that body is you've got
[57:13] to follow that same pattern water blood
[57:16] and life of god
[57:18] you've got to be justified amen
[57:20] believing on jesus christ amen for your
[57:22] sins as a sinner amen to cleanse you and
[57:25] wash you you must be sanctified by the
[57:28] blood of jesus christ and you must
[57:30] receive the holy ghost in order to enter
[57:32] back into the body of jesus christ but
[57:35] once in that body never forget once you
[57:38] enter back into that realm into that
[57:40] place that body the very propitiation
[57:43] that was made for you
[57:44] amen and the dying lamb of calvary amen
[57:48] the blood even sprinkling upon the earth
[57:52] not only brought back all of the
[57:54] redemptive blessing of god
[58:01] but it also
[58:03] purchased the earth
[58:05] i own this earth
[58:07] because his blood fell on it
[58:10] hallelujah
[58:12] brother may i pause for a moment would
[58:14] somebody grab me a bottle of water it's
[58:15] a little dusty i think maybe it's the
[58:17] reason i'm choking a little bit
[58:20] i thought but somebody's been sucking on
[58:22] it
[58:23] am i going to describe that well if i
[58:25] can chew your chewing gum i might drink
[58:26] your water
[58:29] [Laughter]
[58:32] all right
[58:33] you excuse
[58:34] me but if i'm a part of christ
[58:38] he said every redemptive blessing of god
[58:40] thank
[58:42] there's nothing tonight
[58:45] that's out of our reach
[58:48] don't you listen to that
[58:49] if you've got the holy ghost
[58:52] there's nothing out of your reach
[58:55] not even death
[58:57] can overcome you
[58:58] until our lord and our master says it's
[59:00] time
[59:02] for your card to be pulled from the
[59:03] right brother that's up to him not up to
[59:05] us
[59:06] and we learned a great lesson from
[59:07] hezekiah when it's my time to go i don't
[59:10] want to argue
[59:12] i don't want to become shipwrecked down
[59:13] at the very end because i choose to live
[59:15] on
[59:16] when's my time to go i just want to be
[59:19] able to go
[59:21] i'll never forget
[59:23] when i was in that motel room in
[59:24] connecticut
[59:25] and i was having that great attack with
[59:27] a
[59:28] sugar diabetes
[59:30] and old man death comes stood about
[59:32] eight foot down by me
[59:34] i felt him walk into the room i didn't
[59:35] see anything but i felt him walk in the
[59:37] room like a person would walk in the
[59:38] door and shut it behind him
[59:40] as i lay there in bed i was sitting
[59:42] there like indian style you know my legs
[59:44] crossed over and i was sitting there
[59:46] all at once it seemed like the holy
[59:48] spirit said to me
[59:49] that's death i said yes sir
[59:52] but i didn't fear him i wasn't afraid of
[59:55] him because brother because of the death
[59:58] of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:01] death is no more to you and i than a
[1:00:03] buggy
[1:00:04] [Laughter]
[1:00:05] come on somebody amen to carry me from
[1:00:08] this realm into another dimension
[1:00:10] altogether
[1:00:12] hallelujah i don't have to fear these
[1:00:13] things because the head of satan has
[1:00:16] been cut off so completely
[1:00:18] that not even death itself
[1:00:21] can touch a believer did you know that
[1:00:23] believers don't die
[1:00:25] did you know that brother man called it
[1:00:27] a dirt nap
[1:00:29] they just fall asleep
[1:00:31] all the believers that have gone through
[1:00:34] all of these ages all the 2000 years
[1:00:38] that saints
[1:00:39] have drawn their last breath and their
[1:00:42] body go limp and cold
[1:00:44] those believers
[1:00:45] simply fell asleep in the arms of jesus
[1:00:49] they don't have to fear death because
[1:00:50] death has already been conquered
[1:00:53] because of his propitiation at calvary
[1:00:56] uh folks i hope you understand that as
[1:00:58] deep as we are in this message and as
[1:01:01] revelated as we try to push ourselves
[1:01:03] and as many of these big words and terms
[1:01:06] that we throw around to many of the
[1:01:07] saints around the world at the end of
[1:01:09] the day if you don't understand that
[1:01:12] your sins amen everything that you'll
[1:01:15] ever be
[1:01:17] was hanging on that old tree
[1:01:20] you'll never get anywhere with god until
[1:01:22] you get that lesson first
[1:01:25] because you can't save yourself
[1:01:27] i i know i'm in legalist territory with
[1:01:30] all these amis around here but i don't
[1:01:31] mean to hurt your feelings but you can't
[1:01:33] save yourself
[1:01:35] i can't live good enough to get there
[1:01:38] i have no merits
[1:01:41] to be able to present to him remember
[1:01:42] danny greenfield the great evangelist
[1:01:45] he said i thought i was a pretty good
[1:01:46] guy
[1:01:47] oh maybe a lie here there or something
[1:01:49] like that he said but then when i got in
[1:01:50] the presence of that light brother tom
[1:01:53] he said everything i ever even thought
[1:01:56] he said started showing up before me
[1:01:59] it goes to prove brother that the
[1:02:01] propitiation of calvary
[1:02:03] was necessary for you and i to be
[1:02:05] overcomers
[1:02:07] without the cross and without the death
[1:02:09] of the cross and without jesus bearing
[1:02:12] the sin mark in his body
[1:02:16] satan would still have rule
[1:02:19] over every one of us
[1:02:22] do you understand that up until the
[1:02:24] death of our lord jesus that we
[1:02:29] were completely enslaved to satan
[1:02:36] even those that had a seed as brethren
[1:02:39] tells the spoken words original seed he
[1:02:41] said there was the saints of god that
[1:02:42] old testament they had the seed but they
[1:02:45] had no water the holy ghost
[1:02:47] so when they died they went to paradise
[1:02:50] but satan had total control
[1:02:54] dominated them
[1:02:56] in many cases
[1:02:58] oh you don't think so just look at moses
[1:03:01] moses could not control his temper and
[1:03:02] kept him out of the promised land you
[1:03:04] know why he didn't have a holy ghost
[1:03:06] had he been born again he'd have been
[1:03:08] able to control his temper
[1:03:11] and the saints said amen
[1:03:14] huh
[1:03:15] had had david had the ability to control
[1:03:19] his urges
[1:03:23] i'm not saying that people that make
[1:03:25] mistakes and do things wrong lose their
[1:03:26] temper some don't have the holy ghost
[1:03:29] but how far can a man go
[1:03:32] how far can a woman go before you start
[1:03:34] questioning
[1:03:35] is there a new birth there
[1:03:37] the prophet even said in the hebrew
[1:03:39] series that a dove might lighten a bar
[1:03:41] room but he'll get out of there
[1:03:42] eventually quick
[1:03:44] it doesn't mean that people won't
[1:03:46] backslide do things wrong but the very
[1:03:48] essence of the holy ghost
[1:03:50] gives them power
[1:03:52] over the thing that would dominate and
[1:03:55] control them
[1:03:56] oh i hope somebody's hearing me tonight
[1:03:59] this is the reason why sometimes we feel
[1:04:01] so powerless
[1:04:02] have you ever felt that way
[1:04:04] you wake up in the morning and something
[1:04:06] may be going on or some little thing
[1:04:08] happening in your life and you think to
[1:04:09] yourself i can't control this you're
[1:04:12] right
[1:04:13] but the holy ghost within you
[1:04:17] praise god that baptism of the holy
[1:04:19] ghost on the inside of you
[1:04:22] can control the situation
[1:04:25] if you'll just let him have hold of it
[1:04:30] i i don't mean to sound skeptical but
[1:04:32] this is where we fail
[1:04:34] because we we're not really so much
[1:04:36] confident that god can handle it
[1:04:39] we say we believe that
[1:04:40] we claim we believe that
[1:04:42] but we don't act like we believe that
[1:04:45] you know how i know that because how
[1:04:47] many times have you
[1:04:48] taken a situation into your hands
[1:04:52] tried to fix it tried to make it better
[1:04:55] even after you declared up here at the
[1:04:56] altar or wherever it was and testified
[1:04:58] i'm giving it to god let him handle it
[1:05:00] that lasts all of about oh
[1:05:03] five minutes 48 seconds
[1:05:07] and then as soon as something jumps up
[1:05:09] we grab right ahold of it again instead
[1:05:11] of
[1:05:12] releasing our control
[1:05:14] and saying lord you take over
[1:05:17] come on now be honest with me
[1:05:19] now i'm not trying to de-christianize
[1:05:20] you but how many times have you fallen
[1:05:22] into that trap
[1:05:24] and yet the real reason we do it is
[1:05:26] because we have not entrusted
[1:05:29] in this propitiation i'm preaching on
[1:05:33] we have not allowed ourselves to rest
[1:05:36] in the finished work of calvary
[1:05:40] brother sister please don't
[1:05:41] misunderstand what i'm getting to say
[1:05:42] but this is the reason
[1:05:44] if there is a delay to the rapture this
[1:05:47] is it
[1:05:49] it is not because we don't have great
[1:05:51] mysteries
[1:05:52] it is not because we don't have great
[1:05:53] understanding of those mysteries
[1:05:56] but at the end of the day
[1:05:58] it's because we have not fully
[1:06:00] surrendered ourself
[1:06:02] to the finished work
[1:06:04] of calvary
[1:06:06] in our lives
[1:06:08] you might as well preach his coughing
[1:06:09] kicking and all i'm coming
[1:06:12] huh
[1:06:14] because brother realize something
[1:06:16] if we really had that kind of confidence
[1:06:20] do you understand there is nothing
[1:06:22] that could shake us
[1:06:25] nothing that could move us
[1:06:27] no matter what would come our way
[1:06:29] nothing
[1:06:31] could shake us off that foundation
[1:06:34] oh you said oh brother ben ah
[1:06:37] they've pumped so much stuff and you you
[1:06:39] went brain dead
[1:06:41] let me tell you what your bible said in
[1:06:42] the book of peter we go to second peter
[1:06:44] chapter one he's talking about all them
[1:06:46] great virtues in there we'd like to
[1:06:47] preach on
[1:06:48] go to the end of those verses
[1:06:51] and look at what peter said those
[1:06:52] virtues do for you
[1:06:54] they make you
[1:06:56] but you can't fall
[1:07:00] now even like tabernacle i'm going to
[1:07:01] ask you this question you don't have to
[1:07:03] answer me vocally but just in your heart
[1:07:05] when are we going to arrive at the place
[1:07:08] to where we truly can be so
[1:07:11] rested
[1:07:12] in this finished work of the lord jesus
[1:07:16] until no matter if we're laying in a
[1:07:18] hospital bed or or we're bankrupt or no
[1:07:20] matter what's going on around us
[1:07:22] there is a peace we might be troubled
[1:07:25] sure we might be upset absolutely might
[1:07:27] be confused absolutely
[1:07:29] but but beyond all of that if you dig
[1:07:31] deeper
[1:07:32] you know what i'm talking about if you
[1:07:33] go beyond all of that outward emotion
[1:07:37] and all those outward manifestations and
[1:07:39] you really start digging down
[1:07:44] for a real believer that is rested
[1:07:47] in the finished work of calvary
[1:07:49] no matter what somebody might be telling
[1:07:51] them in their ear
[1:07:53] there's a peace on the inside
[1:07:56] maybe bankrupt today but god's got a
[1:07:58] purpose
[1:08:00] maybe he's sick today but god's got a
[1:08:01] purpose so and so may have died but
[1:08:03] god's got a purpose
[1:08:05] do you understand this is where our
[1:08:07] prophet arrived
[1:08:09] in the last moments of his life in the
[1:08:11] last years of his life
[1:08:14] he come to the conclusion
[1:08:17] that christ
[1:08:19] is in control
[1:08:20] of it all
[1:08:25] i've quoted this to you a million times
[1:08:27] but allow me to back it up with these
[1:08:28] words
[1:08:30] go back to patmos vision he said a man
[1:08:32] that is fully surrendered to god fully
[1:08:35] not partially not halfway fully
[1:08:37] surrendered to god
[1:08:39] is
[1:08:40] omnipotent
[1:08:52] now being settled in the finished work
[1:08:54] of calvary does not mean
[1:08:56] that we won't get sick
[1:08:59] for these
[1:09:02] by the time i'm searching for a nice
[1:09:03] word but it's hard under the anointing
[1:09:06] imbeciles don't sound nice
[1:09:08] idiots probably don't play
[1:09:10] i'll just put a blank there and let you
[1:09:12] all figure it out
[1:09:14] but for these people that run around the
[1:09:15] message going the bride's never going to
[1:09:18] get the covet the bride's never going to
[1:09:19] get cancer the bride's never
[1:09:22] what kind of stupid juice have you been
[1:09:24] drinking
[1:09:29] that's about like saying of the prophet
[1:09:30] of god a drunk driver is never going to
[1:09:32] kill the prophet
[1:09:35] let me tell you something brother satan
[1:09:37] has access to this body
[1:09:40] not control over it
[1:09:41] access
[1:09:43] and if god permits him
[1:09:45] to allow things come through your life
[1:09:47] or allow this thing to happen or that
[1:09:49] thing to happen
[1:09:52] you're going to either trust
[1:09:54] or you're going to flounder
[1:09:57] i was talking to an individual the other
[1:09:59] day
[1:10:00] brother ben do you realize that some
[1:10:01] people are saying that the vaccine is
[1:10:03] the mark of the beast i said this
[1:10:04] because they don't listen to tapes
[1:10:07] that's because they don't read the
[1:10:08] message
[1:10:09] the mark of the beast has nothing to do
[1:10:11] with a vaccine the mic of the beast has
[1:10:13] nothing to do with all this nonsense
[1:10:15] people keep barking about the the real
[1:10:17] mark of the beast friend is rejecting
[1:10:18] the holy ghost
[1:10:20] it's rejecting your message in the hour
[1:10:22] you're living your day and your hour
[1:10:30] okay hang on everybody
[1:10:32] there's nothing we can do about covet
[1:10:36] there is nothing we can do about cancer
[1:10:39] there is nothing we can do oh you say
[1:10:42] we'll build hospitals yes
[1:10:45] we'll come up with a a certain medical
[1:10:48] yes
[1:10:50] and if god permits it to work
[1:10:53] you'll do it and it'll be succeed
[1:10:56] don't forget brother adam is the very
[1:10:57] one that took vaccines going overseas
[1:11:01] even though he didn't want he did
[1:11:03] because he said god allowed medicines
[1:11:05] like that to come on the earth to help
[1:11:07] us
[1:11:08] he said i pray for doctors i pray for
[1:11:10] hospitals
[1:11:14] sure
[1:11:16] because all good things come down from
[1:11:18] the father of lights
[1:11:19] in whom there is no variableness
[1:11:22] now i'm not trying to preach to you
[1:11:23] tonight why not go get your vaccine
[1:11:25] that's up to you you do what you want
[1:11:28] but the point i'm making to you
[1:11:30] is a lot of these conditions around us
[1:11:34] that we try to to to manage by saying oh
[1:11:37] it's bride people you know what we many
[1:11:40] many many years ago some of you here uh
[1:11:43] that go back with me
[1:11:45] i'm a 70s baby okay and some of you go
[1:11:47] far beyond that
[1:11:49] i can take brother floyd and some of
[1:11:51] them science they've been in this thing
[1:11:52] a long time
[1:11:54] in the early days of this message we
[1:11:56] thought everybody was angels
[1:11:59] until we found out someone was the kind
[1:12:01] that rides motorcycles
[1:12:05] you'll get it tomorrow
[1:12:10] we found out not everybody that called
[1:12:12] william branham's name was really saints
[1:12:15] what a shock it was to us
[1:12:18] to find out that we're homosexuals in
[1:12:19] the
[1:12:20] message child molesters in the message
[1:12:24] lesbians and whoremongers in a message
[1:12:27] oh my god you mean there's people in the
[1:12:29] message that lie
[1:12:34] it like to took the wind out of some of
[1:12:36] us when we found out certain leaders did
[1:12:38] certain things
[1:12:40] you know why because we have this idea
[1:12:44] of control
[1:12:45] and we have created this message utopia
[1:12:49] around us
[1:12:51] everything is fine nothing to see here
[1:12:54] move along
[1:12:57] and when it boils down to it the reason
[1:12:59] many people cannot go on with the lord
[1:13:02] is because they've never fully rested
[1:13:07] in the finished work
[1:13:09] of calvary
[1:13:12] it doesn't mean we're not going to get
[1:13:13] sick
[1:13:14] but what it means is while i'm sick
[1:13:16] while i'm taking medicines
[1:13:18] while the doctors are doing what they
[1:13:19] can for me nurses doing what they can
[1:13:21] for me
[1:13:22] i'm trusting the lord
[1:13:25] father you put me in this position you
[1:13:27] allowed me to be here you have a reason
[1:13:29] for it
[1:13:30] whatever the testimony is going to come
[1:13:32] out of this
[1:13:33] let it be red hot let it let it be so
[1:13:35] red hot let it be so powerful shake the
[1:13:37] shingles off the roof
[1:13:42] but friends let's be honest how many
[1:13:45] times do we get right in the middle of
[1:13:46] that heat
[1:13:48] and all of a sudden we start getting
[1:13:49] scared fearful
[1:13:51] worried
[1:13:52] are you are you ever going to come to
[1:13:54] the place to where you can hit a
[1:13:56] spiritual message button and never worry
[1:13:58] again
[1:13:58] don't kid yourself
[1:14:01] you'll always worry
[1:14:03] you'll always have fear sure those
[1:14:05] things will always be a part of your
[1:14:07] human nature
[1:14:09] but beyond all that
[1:14:12] dig underneath all of that
[1:14:14] because you see the bride is likened to
[1:14:18] the moon
[1:14:20] feeling good to start preaching now you
[1:14:22] all ready to preach
[1:14:25] the prophet of god set the moon as we
[1:14:27] know controls he said the tide
[1:14:31] the sun is the lord jesus and he said
[1:14:33] the moon is the church
[1:14:35] it has no light of its own glory to god
[1:14:41] but when the sun begins to beam
[1:14:46] i was in washington sometime ago in one
[1:14:48] of the
[1:14:49] aerospace um museums of smithsonian's
[1:14:52] and and somebody i heard him say moon
[1:14:54] rock i'd always wanted to see moon rock
[1:14:57] you know i thought i would see something
[1:14:59] out of
[1:15:00] you know out of the jetsons or something
[1:15:01] like that it'd be some glowing rock you
[1:15:02] know floating in the air some kind of a
[1:15:04] thing
[1:15:07] it was just an old stupid rock
[1:15:12] i thought what's so spectacular about
[1:15:14] this it comes from the moon
[1:15:18] and then as i stood there looking at
[1:15:19] that little piece of rock
[1:15:21] dead lifeless had no color had no light
[1:15:24] the lord began reminding me
[1:15:27] you see its problem is he told me
[1:15:30] that rock there is out of its position
[1:15:35] he said because allow one of these
[1:15:36] astronauts the ability to take it
[1:15:39] and put it back in its rightful position
[1:15:42] when my light would shine on it
[1:15:45] it would reflect the glory of the sun
[1:15:48] i thought oh god how is that for so many
[1:15:50] believers
[1:15:51] that get disjointed dysfunctional they
[1:15:54] get they get they get a such an abusive
[1:15:56] thing in their mind
[1:15:59] oh i'm no good i'm sorry i'm this i'm
[1:16:02] that you're right you're nothing but a
[1:16:04] dumb rock
[1:16:07] but in your position
[1:16:11] and in your place
[1:16:14] let that sunshine on you one time
[1:16:18] and the glory of this
[1:16:22] the glory of his majesty hallelujah
[1:16:26] will shine right through you
[1:16:31] like it does the rest of the moon
[1:16:36] as you see he said the moon
[1:16:38] controls the tide he said the moon will
[1:16:40] turn to worship the lord
[1:16:43] he said the tide waters will start
[1:16:44] getting out of order
[1:16:46] he said that moon's like a policeman
[1:16:49] he swings around there's a stop
[1:16:52] he puts that tide back in its place
[1:16:55] the prophet of god likened this
[1:16:58] to sin and the attributes
[1:17:00] of sin
[1:17:01] listen
[1:17:03] the very thing
[1:17:05] that the lord jesus put a stop to at
[1:17:07] calvary
[1:17:09] is the very thing you've been given to
[1:17:12] govern over
[1:17:15] he said what does that mean
[1:17:18] he said the sin that once ruled you
[1:17:21] you now
[1:17:23] rule it
[1:17:25] and not only that he goes on to say you
[1:17:26] have overcome it overthrown it
[1:17:28] handcuffed it and threw it in prison
[1:17:31] [Laughter]
[1:17:37] but it's up to us how we're going to
[1:17:39] view this
[1:17:41] some of you that's got lasting
[1:17:43] conditions in your body diabetic high
[1:17:45] blood pressure
[1:17:49] scoliosis
[1:17:52] might be abnormalities in your flesh and
[1:17:54] your body
[1:17:55] and and somehow the devil tries to
[1:17:58] convince you
[1:17:59] that because of those things you don't
[1:18:01] have any faith
[1:18:03] but what satan is failing to share with
[1:18:05] you
[1:18:06] okay can i just expose him
[1:18:09] what he is failing to share with you my
[1:18:11] friend
[1:18:13] is that none of that in the flesh
[1:18:16] has anything to do
[1:18:18] with your confidence
[1:18:20] in calvary
[1:18:25] i mean what are we supposed to expect
[1:18:27] it is appointed unto man wants to die
[1:18:29] that means every one of us have an
[1:18:31] appointment
[1:18:34] that's what i loved about enoch
[1:18:36] people wondered about enoch
[1:18:40] god take him up like that i said it's
[1:18:41] simple the man that made the appointment
[1:18:44] can be the same man to cancel it
[1:18:48] he just canceled enoch's appointment
[1:18:51] don't be deceived there's going to be a
[1:18:52] few alive and remain that's going to
[1:18:54] have their appointments canceled as well
[1:18:56] [Laughter]
[1:18:58] glory to god
[1:19:01] elijah was the same way
[1:19:04] this isn't so much canceled as postponed
[1:19:08] did you imagine being taken up into
[1:19:09] heaven all them years
[1:19:11] well it's been
[1:19:12] every bit of four or five thousand years
[1:19:14] probably elijah has been enjoying the
[1:19:16] paradises and the beauties of god
[1:19:19] and then god will send him right back
[1:19:21] down to the earth
[1:19:22] to suffer death
[1:19:24] it's a marvel isn't it
[1:19:26] but it goes to prove once again god's
[1:19:28] sovereignty
[1:19:30] i don't imagine elijah will come back to
[1:19:31] this earth in whatever way you believe
[1:19:32] he's going to come but he's going to die
[1:19:34] one of the other i don't believe when he
[1:19:38] takes the breath of life and then not
[1:19:40] takes the breath of life
[1:19:42] that he's gonna be going back in that
[1:19:43] dimension cry to god god
[1:19:46] i'm elijah the prophet would you let me
[1:19:48] die for
[1:19:51] he's going to know like the rest of us
[1:19:53] death
[1:19:54] where is your sting crave where is your
[1:19:58] victory
[1:20:01] listen at these words let them sing to
[1:20:04] you don't let these be just repetitious
[1:20:05] quotes the prophet of god said to a
[1:20:08] believer
[1:20:09] death is no more than a bluff
[1:20:20] and yet we get so scared
[1:20:24] when a doctor looks at us and says
[1:20:26] cancer
[1:20:27] or some other thing
[1:20:29] should we be
[1:20:31] so i'm giving you grace in this matter
[1:20:33] because
[1:20:33] humanly speaking
[1:20:35] it's nine impossible not to be worried
[1:20:38] it'd be almost impossible if a doctor
[1:20:40] said to me
[1:20:41] i had six months to live
[1:20:43] you mean to tell me you're so spiritual
[1:20:45] that your flesh wouldn't go what
[1:20:48] come on don't you all look at me like
[1:20:50] that
[1:20:52] you want me to tell me if the doctor
[1:20:53] told you you had some incurable disease
[1:20:56] that there wouldn't be a part of you go
[1:20:59] lord i
[1:21:00] i don't want to die now
[1:21:03] sure there's always that element there
[1:21:05] but again this is what satan is not
[1:21:08] sharing with you
[1:21:09] none of that
[1:21:10] has anything to do with your confidence
[1:21:14] in a finished work at calvary
[1:21:20] oh i feel the holy ghost in this place
[1:21:23] god quicken it to us lord make it
[1:21:26] real so you see
[1:21:29] when life is coming look at a woman when
[1:21:32] she's carrying a child
[1:21:34] if i use improper words for some of you
[1:21:36] forgive me i understand some people get
[1:21:37] offended we talk about a woman being
[1:21:39] impregnated or something of that nature
[1:21:42] but brother brown talked about how that
[1:21:44] when a woman is pregnant
[1:21:47] he said that little life on the inside
[1:21:49] of her
[1:21:50] forgive me
[1:21:52] he said it's drawing from her
[1:21:55] she gets sick
[1:21:57] brother carol i i used to love the way
[1:21:59] that he would describe this
[1:22:01] i quote him a lot because he was my
[1:22:02] pastor for 15 years y'all i knew the man
[1:22:04] since i was 16.
[1:22:07] he married my wife and i
[1:22:10] dedicated all my kids
[1:22:13] i preached alongside him for many many
[1:22:14] years
[1:22:16] and if i heard him say it once i heard
[1:22:18] him say it a thousand times i'm not
[1:22:19] contagious by the way
[1:22:24] he made the remark to me one time like
[1:22:26] this
[1:22:27] he said think of that woman he said
[1:22:28] there she's standing there cooking some
[1:22:30] eggs and bacon
[1:22:31] fine everything's going fine in the day
[1:22:32] and said all of a sudden that bacon hits
[1:22:34] her nose and she goes
[1:22:37] he said what's going on ben
[1:22:39] there's another life there
[1:22:42] that's drawing from the outside
[1:22:46] scripture tells us that in
[1:22:49] her conception
[1:22:50] it'll be sorrowful
[1:22:53] carrying the child will be sorrowful
[1:22:56] there'll be many of those conditions
[1:22:57] that will come
[1:22:59] during the nine months ever how long
[1:23:01] that might be
[1:23:03] if it's jessica louise norad she was so
[1:23:05] interested in getting into this world
[1:23:06] quickly in the middle of our family she
[1:23:08] got here four weeks early
[1:23:10] nosy thing
[1:23:15] and there was something about
[1:23:17] the trials of that
[1:23:21] that you would look and you'd say what
[1:23:22] an awful thing to put a woman through
[1:23:25] you know this is the reason some of our
[1:23:26] modern women have dogs and cats instead
[1:23:28] of children
[1:23:30] they think it's horrible for a man to
[1:23:32] put them through that
[1:23:36] and looking on the outside you would
[1:23:38] think
[1:23:39] terrible but don't forget
[1:23:43] the reason all of that's happening on
[1:23:44] the outside
[1:23:46] there's a life on the inside
[1:23:52] did you ever stop to think why trials
[1:23:53] come your way
[1:23:55] while you wake up one morning in a phone
[1:23:57] call
[1:24:00] or something somebody will say to you at
[1:24:02] church
[1:24:06] will cause a change or reaction in you
[1:24:08] you know why that's happening
[1:24:10] there's a life on the inside
[1:24:13] and that life is drawing
[1:24:16] these things into your life
[1:24:19] you being a christian just naming the
[1:24:20] name of jesus christ put your head on a
[1:24:23] chopping blonde
[1:24:24] come on somebody
[1:24:27] the very fact that you even say you're
[1:24:29] born again puts a target on you
[1:24:32] a bull's eye right on your forehead
[1:24:36] don't think these things peter said
[1:24:38] these fiery trials to be strange
[1:24:41] they said they're not strange don't
[1:24:44] think some odd thing has happened to you
[1:24:46] in the church book the prophet said
[1:24:48] trials and tribulations are a natural
[1:24:51] normal part of a christian's life
[1:24:55] there is nothing we can do about them
[1:24:59] he said but commit their final
[1:25:00] outworking to the hands of god
[1:25:03] in other words in my language tonight
[1:25:06] have confidence in the finished work
[1:25:09] that's going to get you through to the
[1:25:10] other side of this
[1:25:17] you look at those folks fed the lions
[1:25:19] burn at the stakes and the whole bit
[1:25:21] like and you think of yourself
[1:25:23] the world must look at these people like
[1:25:24] they're losers
[1:25:27] we look at them like they're winners
[1:25:31] why why do we have such a perspective of
[1:25:34] that because we realize what they were
[1:25:35] fighting for
[1:25:40] they wasn't trying to survive
[1:25:44] they were overcoming
[1:25:46] can i say something
[1:25:47] how can you overcome
[1:25:49] if there's nothing set before you
[1:25:52] to overcome
[1:25:55] maybe god won't take it away maybe god
[1:25:57] won't let it come out of your life maybe
[1:25:59] some preacher can't pray it off of you
[1:26:02] because it's your battle
[1:26:04] your fight
[1:26:05] excuse this it's your pregnancy
[1:26:10] and the thing that is affecting you
[1:26:13] it's affecting you because something new
[1:26:16] a new birth
[1:26:19] a fresh creation
[1:26:27] something's got to be wrong with us
[1:26:30] you mean as a christian
[1:26:32] you're going to go through bad things
[1:26:34] yeah
[1:26:36] but i thought christianity was a
[1:26:38] wonderful thing it is
[1:26:41] but there's going to be a lot of hard
[1:26:42] times come with it
[1:26:45] a lot of troublesome things come along
[1:26:48] but i don't want you to forget this
[1:26:51] the word of god
[1:26:53] will defeat satan
[1:26:55] any place
[1:26:58] be it in the church
[1:27:00] be in your bedroom in front of a
[1:27:01] computer
[1:27:03] be it on your job
[1:27:05] on a machine
[1:27:06] being in a hospital bed or be in a
[1:27:08] pulpit
[1:27:10] any place
[1:27:12] anytime
[1:27:14] whether you're feeling sick whether
[1:27:15] you're feeling well whether you're happy
[1:27:17] whether you're sad
[1:27:20] under any circumstance
[1:27:23] you might say i'm so low i can't even
[1:27:25] hold my head up spiritually
[1:27:27] under any condition
[1:27:29] the word of god will defeat the devil
[1:27:32] every time
[1:27:38] so then what am i supposed to do oh i'm
[1:27:40] so glad you asked me
[1:27:42] i've been waiting all night for you to
[1:27:43] ask me that question
[1:27:47] we read it
[1:27:50] take unto you
[1:27:52] the whole armor of god
[1:27:56] i want to look at it for a moment
[1:27:58] just a little bit and we'll go
[1:28:00] i got no idea what time it is and it's
[1:28:02] probably a good thing
[1:28:07] for me for me
[1:28:10] wherefore take unto you okay
[1:28:12] stop right there
[1:28:14] did you notice it didn't say take unto
[1:28:16] them
[1:28:19] you y o u
[1:28:22] this shows us
[1:28:25] this is a personal
[1:28:27] individual
[1:28:30] warfare
[1:28:36] forgive me
[1:28:38] i cannot fight
[1:28:40] your battles for you
[1:28:44] i pray for you
[1:28:45] and hold your hands up when you get weak
[1:28:48] but i cannot fight
[1:28:50] your battle
[1:28:52] for you
[1:28:55] when you go to brother tom or brother
[1:28:57] floyd or some other minister or somebody
[1:28:59] in the church you've got confidence in
[1:29:01] and you're asking them for advice
[1:29:04] you're always saying the thing how do i
[1:29:08] how how what do i do how do i
[1:29:11] you you understand
[1:29:12] you skipped over the main part of it
[1:29:15] to try to find an answer you're never
[1:29:17] going to find from somebody else
[1:29:19] i just read to you how to fight how what
[1:29:21] the answer is and how to fight
[1:29:24] you want to know how to whip it
[1:29:26] want to know how to beat it
[1:29:29] take unto you
[1:29:31] the whole armor of god
[1:29:34] 99 of the time if you'll investigate
[1:29:37] your losses
[1:29:38] it is because you didn't fight
[1:29:41] when the thing come at you
[1:29:45] talk to me tonight church i need to hear
[1:29:47] you
[1:29:48] this is one of these messages where you
[1:29:49] can't sit quiet on me now
[1:29:54] your participation in this tonight is is
[1:29:56] key to understanding and releasing the
[1:29:58] anointing upon you to receive what i'm
[1:30:00] talking about
[1:30:02] it's essential for you to get this
[1:30:05] you only need to amend this with your
[1:30:07] mouth but you need to open spirit and
[1:30:08] all the gates of your spirit your body
[1:30:10] and your soul and say god
[1:30:13] let this thing so pierce my being
[1:30:17] until i am different from this night on
[1:30:19] i walk out of here completely different
[1:30:21] altogether
[1:30:23] because if not it's just another
[1:30:24] protractive sermon preached nice about
[1:30:26] calvary they ain't going to do no good
[1:30:28] for nobody
[1:30:32] take unto you
[1:30:35] the whole armor of god
[1:30:37] that ye
[1:30:41] will stand in the evil day
[1:30:43] and then here's here's a great key for
[1:30:45] all of us and having done all to stand
[1:30:46] stand there
[1:30:48] it goes to prove even paul is describing
[1:30:51] to us in this very first part of
[1:30:53] introducing the armor of god
[1:30:55] he's trying to tell us
[1:30:57] you're not always going to have the
[1:30:58] answers
[1:31:02] remember your participation is key
[1:31:05] now don't don't don't think to yourself
[1:31:07] that you're always going to know how to
[1:31:09] turn
[1:31:10] don't think to yourself you're always
[1:31:12] going to know how to yield the sword or
[1:31:13] how to hold your shield
[1:31:16] there's going to be moments of your life
[1:31:18] and your walk with god you're not going
[1:31:19] to know the answer
[1:31:22] so what do i do stan
[1:31:26] don't go forward don't go backwards
[1:31:27] stand what ground you've got
[1:31:30] and hold it there until the lord moves
[1:31:32] you
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:37] but you say brother ben that sounds
[1:31:38] pretty boring
[1:31:42] that sounds a little bit uh
[1:31:44] lazy even
[1:31:48] but do you understand that
[1:31:52] part of healing
[1:31:55] is not always when they're standing
[1:31:57] there on the front lines with the big
[1:31:58] medicines
[1:32:00] piercing that needle into you or or or
[1:32:02] shoving in that antibiotic or
[1:32:05] beepers beeping and
[1:32:07] all these things going off around you
[1:32:09] know part of the essential part of
[1:32:10] healing
[1:32:12] sometimes it's just to do nothing
[1:32:15] and rest
[1:32:17] amen i'm glad you said it
[1:32:20] your participation is key
[1:32:24] because the victory tonight is going to
[1:32:25] come out of your mouth
[1:32:26] i'm telling you that in the name of the
[1:32:28] lord the victory you get out of this
[1:32:29] building now this sermon tonight it's
[1:32:30] going to come out of your mouth tonight
[1:32:32] if you're going to walk out of here
[1:32:34] different you're going to speak it
[1:32:35] sitting right there in the views i'm
[1:32:36] telling you that in the name of the lord
[1:32:41] because nothing i would say from this
[1:32:43] right here is going to change anything
[1:32:45] until you're willing to possess
[1:32:47] these words
[1:32:52] he said brother ben that scares me why
[1:32:56] well i don't know what to do yes you do
[1:32:58] stand
[1:33:00] don't move
[1:33:01] be patient wait
[1:33:04] glory
[1:33:05] i'm so glad he put that in there brother
[1:33:07] tom
[1:33:09] there's a lot of victory
[1:33:11] in just waiting
[1:33:13] sometimes brother sister god will park
[1:33:15] you
[1:33:17] and make you wait
[1:33:20] don't forget the bible said they
[1:33:23] that wait upon the lord
[1:33:26] shall renew their strength
[1:33:29] and rise up
[1:33:31] not only will you be renewed but you'll
[1:33:32] rise up again
[1:33:35] waiting has power in it
[1:33:38] if we're willing to wait
[1:33:41] upon the lord
[1:33:43] now waiting upon yourself that's
[1:33:45] different that'll get you in trouble
[1:33:47] because remember not always the sins you
[1:33:48] do sometimes it's the neglection of the
[1:33:50] things you're not doing that you should
[1:33:51] be doing
[1:33:52] so it's not the waiting upon yourself
[1:33:54] among you
[1:33:56] praise god
[1:33:59] now notice this stand therefore
[1:34:02] having your loins gird about with truth
[1:34:04] what is that the word of god
[1:34:06] now notice the area of the body that
[1:34:08] paul is likening this to
[1:34:11] is the place where progeny or seed is
[1:34:14] planted
[1:34:16] so truth being a seed jesus saying so
[1:34:19] that the word of god was a seed
[1:34:22] then the loins of truth represent the
[1:34:25] passing
[1:34:26] of seed life let me give you an example
[1:34:28] what i mean
[1:34:29] if you're standing in a situation and
[1:34:31] you don't know what to do
[1:34:33] but all of a sudden you feel inspired by
[1:34:36] hold it by the holy ghost to speak the
[1:34:38] word
[1:34:40] that is the passing of the seed of life
[1:34:42] from the loins of truth
[1:34:45] that because his word will not return
[1:34:47] void it will always find a betting
[1:34:49] ground
[1:34:51] that may not do it today but later will
[1:34:53] produce victory in you
[1:34:56] praise god
[1:34:58] in other words paul is telling us
[1:35:02] we are not spiritually sterile
[1:35:05] we are not just used as some object to
[1:35:08] look pretty standing in a corner
[1:35:11] we're not mannequins
[1:35:15] but we have the ability to pass the seed
[1:35:18] word
[1:35:19] oh listen
[1:35:20] in spoken words original seed i believe
[1:35:22] it's also on christ the mystery he
[1:35:24] repeats it but a believer can pass
[1:35:27] eternal life
[1:35:29] to another believer
[1:35:32] what is that the loins of truth
[1:35:35] you know sometimes
[1:35:37] it works like this
[1:35:40] you might be talking to somebody in a
[1:35:41] store and you might not know what to say
[1:35:42] to them
[1:35:43] all of a sudden the holy spirit will
[1:35:45] come right at that very moment and just
[1:35:47] drop something into you and you'll pass
[1:35:48] that word on to that person that's the
[1:35:50] loins of truth
[1:35:54] remember satan has the ability to
[1:35:57] impregnate with the seed of discrepancy
[1:35:59] again some of you folk if those words
[1:36:00] offend you you forgive me but i i'm
[1:36:02] quoting from the message i'm just saying
[1:36:04] that brother bram said it
[1:36:07] satan can impregnate by seed of
[1:36:09] discrepancy
[1:36:11] but satan cannot reproduce that seed
[1:36:15] it's hybrid and it comes to its end
[1:36:16] that's why i mule
[1:36:18] don't know who its mommy is don't know
[1:36:20] who its daddy is
[1:36:21] and he cannot trace its bloodline back
[1:36:23] nowhere
[1:36:25] but we that have been
[1:36:27] hallelujah endued with the with a with
[1:36:30] the loins of truth the seed of truth
[1:36:33] we could trace our bloodline and plum
[1:36:35] back to the beginning
[1:36:38] like a thoroughbred horse
[1:36:40] some of you kentuckians i'll be
[1:36:41] screaming amen this is where them horses
[1:36:43] come from
[1:36:44] hallelujah they've got papers they can
[1:36:47] go all the way back to their great great
[1:36:50] great
[1:36:55] they're not confused about who they are
[1:37:01] the pharisees thought they had that one
[1:37:02] down
[1:37:04] jesus just saw that little mystery for
[1:37:06] him
[1:37:07] you wanna know where you come from the
[1:37:08] devil
[1:37:13] why do you accuse me of sin because i
[1:37:15] say that i'm the son of god
[1:37:17] yes i tell you i came from god and i go
[1:37:20] back to him
[1:37:22] for he is the lord
[1:37:25] didn't he also tell us don't take
[1:37:27] thought when you come before magistrate
[1:37:29] and judges in that hour
[1:37:31] what is that the loins of truth
[1:37:35] how is it going to be
[1:37:37] at the resurrection and the rapture that
[1:37:39] you and i will have the ability to speak
[1:37:42] and our bodies obey that confession and
[1:37:45] it will change right around us
[1:37:48] because i believe the holy ghost will
[1:37:49] place the words in our mouth
[1:37:52] when the hour arrives
[1:37:53] change
[1:37:56] you believe what you want to that's what
[1:37:58] i believe
[1:37:59] i believe the seed of truth will fall
[1:38:01] into our bodies our minds our mouths
[1:38:04] and at the permission of the holy ghost
[1:38:06] with his mind in us
[1:38:08] we'll be able to speak with that voice
[1:38:09] of the resurrection
[1:38:11] don't forget
[1:38:12] divine healing is only the evidence
[1:38:15] that there is a divine resurrection
[1:38:17] coming
[1:38:19] hallelujah
[1:38:22] notice again having the breastplate of
[1:38:24] righteousness
[1:38:25] again the masterpiece the prophet of god
[1:38:27] said i watched that that parade go by he
[1:38:29] said and i thought of that great hour
[1:38:32] when them saints will come by proudly
[1:38:34] displaying the blood of jesus christ the
[1:38:37] message of god
[1:38:40] for the day they lived in
[1:38:43] upon their chest
[1:38:45] the breastplate of righteousness why was
[1:38:48] it located over the chest that's where
[1:38:49] your soul's at
[1:38:52] there's a little compartment inside your
[1:38:53] heart science still can't figure it out
[1:38:56] that's where your soul resides
[1:38:59] hallelujah
[1:39:01] showing that i am not righteous because
[1:39:03] of my righteousness
[1:39:05] but my heart is righteous because he
[1:39:07] recovers me
[1:39:09] with his breastplate
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:14] thank you jesus
[1:39:16] oh yes sir having your feet shod listen
[1:39:20] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:39:23] peace
[1:39:24] i wish i had time to break all these
[1:39:26] little phrases and things down to you i
[1:39:28] got so many greek words and things i
[1:39:30] could bring in here right now i would be
[1:39:32] here the rest of the night
[1:39:34] but this word peace
[1:39:37] that he uses here
[1:39:39] feet shod but the preparation of the
[1:39:41] gospel of peace simply means
[1:39:44] we are no longer at war
[1:39:48] with god
[1:39:52] at one time
[1:39:54] you fought him
[1:39:56] argued with him
[1:39:58] wrestled with him
[1:40:01] that's the reason why if you had
[1:40:02] old-fashioned conviction anywhere your
[1:40:03] knuckles were white grabbing the end of
[1:40:05] the bench
[1:40:06] you were still wrestling with him
[1:40:08] until you found out his spirit will not
[1:40:10] always strive with man
[1:40:14] when you got yourself right with god
[1:40:17] the war
[1:40:19] was over
[1:40:21] and instead of standing there
[1:40:24] still at war with god you see this is
[1:40:26] the reason a woman paints her face
[1:40:28] the reason heathens do it too
[1:40:31] subconsciously they don't realize it but
[1:40:33] when you paint your face you're showing
[1:40:35] that you're at war with god
[1:40:38] and every woman that puts mascara on her
[1:40:40] eyes or puts blush or rouge or some of
[1:40:42] that stuff on their face and i i know
[1:40:44] sister but you understand my meaning
[1:40:47] brother i'm talking about pale cheeks
[1:40:48] you know on the sister might put a
[1:40:50] little something on there and pancake or
[1:40:51] something but you see these girls
[1:40:53] running around there their eyes black
[1:40:57] and message girls are just as guilty
[1:40:58] they do what they call the natural look
[1:41:00] they still put makeup on but they make
[1:41:01] it look natural
[1:41:06] same devil
[1:41:07] just a different package
[1:41:10] everyone that does it is showing that
[1:41:12] they're at war with god
[1:41:17] one thing's for sure ladies you keep
[1:41:19] that stuff off your face if you want to
[1:41:20] be pleasing to the lord
[1:41:21] because you don't do that to me god you
[1:41:23] do it to me to man
[1:41:25] or to look like some kind of a thing to
[1:41:27] somebody else
[1:41:30] sure
[1:41:33] my feet are now shod what is my feet
[1:41:36] think
[1:41:37] it's the foundation of who
[1:41:41] if my feet don't work
[1:41:44] then i can't stand
[1:41:46] so how am i going to stand there for
[1:41:49] being completely dressed how am i going
[1:41:51] to stand if
[1:41:53] i have no foundation
[1:41:55] paul is saying
[1:41:57] your very foundation of who you are
[1:42:01] is being at peace
[1:42:04] with god
[1:42:06] some of you might think tonight well
[1:42:09] i'm not at war with him
[1:42:11] really
[1:42:12] okay
[1:42:13] can i challenge that
[1:42:15] can i challenge you that okay
[1:42:18] good thank you for your permission i was
[1:42:19] gonna do it anyways but i just want to
[1:42:20] be nice about it
[1:42:25] but if we were genuinely at peace with
[1:42:27] god like we should be
[1:42:29] and we would not allow so many questions
[1:42:32] to come into our hearts
[1:42:35] when bad stuff happens to us
[1:42:40] ever get mad and feel like you're gonna
[1:42:42] quit
[1:42:43] i i know you probably won't admit it in
[1:42:45] church but
[1:42:48] you ever come to the place where you
[1:42:49] like forget this stuff i've had enough
[1:42:53] you know what's going on
[1:42:55] it is a part of you
[1:42:57] there's a part of you that is still at
[1:42:59] war
[1:43:00] with god you have not settled yourself
[1:43:04] that i'm going to trust him
[1:43:06] no matter what comes my way
[1:43:12] so you've got to put your shoes on
[1:43:14] lace them up
[1:43:16] time tight
[1:43:18] and stand still
[1:43:23] freeze
[1:43:24] i just love how
[1:43:26] we hit them big crescendos and you folks
[1:43:27] are hey man and i bear down on you like
[1:43:30] this and you are quiet as the nazarenes
[1:43:34] that's good that's good when you're
[1:43:35] thinking
[1:43:37] that's good when you're thinking
[1:43:40] last one we'll go home
[1:43:43] notice he says
[1:43:44] and above all taking the shield of faith
[1:43:49] all right now i'm going to take this
[1:43:50] slow because i don't want you to miss
[1:43:51] these words
[1:43:53] wherewith ye shall be able to quench
[1:43:57] all
[1:44:00] now now for those of you
[1:44:02] that want to live a life of 90
[1:44:05] uh it's okay maybe this thing will come
[1:44:07] along and this thing can get through and
[1:44:09] i'll let this pass
[1:44:11] because you know after all
[1:44:13] i'm living 90 right
[1:44:16] do you understand the holy ghost give us
[1:44:18] our shield
[1:44:21] to stop all
[1:44:24] that satan sends our way
[1:44:26] even the little pet besetting sins that
[1:44:29] we put up with
[1:44:32] every day of our life
[1:44:34] come on church
[1:44:37] he did not give us our shield
[1:44:41] to just allow this to come
[1:44:43] allow that to happen
[1:44:44] this to pass ah you know
[1:44:48] no big deal
[1:44:50] you know as a prophet of god said that a
[1:44:52] christian is praying up every hour
[1:44:58] that's exhausting
[1:45:01] so is holding a shield in a battle
[1:45:06] but you better get this through your
[1:45:07] brain
[1:45:09] and let it fall deep into your heart get
[1:45:11] this right tonight
[1:45:13] not tomorrow not a minute from now right
[1:45:15] now get this straight in your heart
[1:45:18] yes it's exhausting
[1:45:20] to check up every hour but you better
[1:45:23] remember
[1:45:25] that every single hour of your life
[1:45:28] satan
[1:45:29] is hurling
[1:45:30] darts at you
[1:45:36] you see we undervalue the importance of
[1:45:38] these things
[1:45:40] because we don't realize the purpose
[1:45:41] behind it
[1:45:43] why would i need to check up every hour
[1:45:45] because i'm in a fight
[1:45:48] it's exhausting
[1:45:50] to think that every moment you've got to
[1:45:52] be oh lord i'm sorry
[1:45:53] god forgive me uh help me but what do
[1:45:55] you think it's like for them soldiers
[1:45:57] out there
[1:45:58] when there's bombs and there's guttery
[1:46:00] and there's all kinds of things going on
[1:46:02] around y'all reckon they're going
[1:46:04] i'm just so wore out i think i'll just
[1:46:06] lean up against this and relax for a bit
[1:46:08] scroll through facebook
[1:46:10] scroll through the gram
[1:46:13] young people will get that
[1:46:15] instagram
[1:46:16] y'all don't call it the crab
[1:46:23] if he does
[1:46:24] it he'll be dead in five minutes
[1:46:28] he has to stay on his toes
[1:46:31] he has to watch every moment
[1:46:34] because he's under
[1:46:36] attack
[1:46:39] if you even take a breath
[1:46:42] satan uses that moment
[1:46:45] to figure out how to work on you next
[1:46:50] exhausting in it
[1:46:52] but here's the beauty of all this
[1:46:58] when i need rest
[1:47:01] when i need to rest from the war
[1:47:04] he hides me
[1:47:07] in his pavilion
[1:47:11] until then
[1:47:12] i better fight
[1:47:14] and i better not lay down my sword
[1:47:17] and i better not put my shield down
[1:47:20] because it's a warfare
[1:47:24] take the helmet of salvation this word
[1:47:26] literally means when you start breaking
[1:47:28] it out the soul
[1:47:30] the helmet of your salvation your brain
[1:47:33] this is the gateway to your soul
[1:47:36] this simply means protect
[1:47:39] your soul
[1:47:40] young people this is the reason you hear
[1:47:42] preachers preaching against things
[1:47:45] i i'm not altogether convinced that
[1:47:46] preachers even know why they're
[1:47:48] preaching against him sometimes without
[1:47:50] any research or any study at all
[1:47:53] they just get the idea in their brain
[1:47:55] it's dangerous it's going to hurt people
[1:47:58] so they just run to the platform and
[1:48:00] start railing on it
[1:48:02] but really remember
[1:48:03] try not to be critical of preachers like
[1:48:05] that
[1:48:06] because what you don't realize is what
[1:48:07] they're trying to do is they're trying
[1:48:08] to protect you
[1:48:10] from taking things into your soul that
[1:48:12] ain't right
[1:48:14] and at the end of the day if a brother
[1:48:16] is railing against facebook or you know
[1:48:19] one of these type of things
[1:48:21] at the end of the day understand you're
[1:48:22] an individual
[1:48:24] and you are answerable to god
[1:48:26] for what you look at on your phone
[1:48:29] for what kind of connections you make i
[1:48:32] guarantee one thing
[1:48:33] my facebook is sanctified
[1:48:35] because if it ain't i make sure it is
[1:48:39] i had a post come through on a guy the
[1:48:41] other day
[1:48:42] and he had a
[1:48:44] it was one of these pictures of brother
[1:48:45] branham and somebody was kneeling before
[1:48:47] it
[1:48:48] and there was a quote above it
[1:48:50] where brother brown was talking about a
[1:48:52] sister
[1:48:53] who kneeled before that picture one in
[1:48:55] houston
[1:48:57] and said god
[1:48:58] and started praying let the pillar of
[1:49:00] fire and let this of brother breanna and
[1:49:03] she was praying in the manor
[1:49:05] and that picture there like that and i
[1:49:06] thought you sneaky devil
[1:49:09] so you know what i done took my little
[1:49:11] finger and i went
[1:49:14] unfriend
[1:49:15] block
[1:49:22] i may be a preacher
[1:49:23] i may have served him for 30 years but i
[1:49:26] don't let my soul become a trash can
[1:49:32] i got cousins and everything that
[1:49:33] wouldn't speak to me except for social
[1:49:35] media they're just those type of people
[1:49:36] in a phone call they don't nothing
[1:49:38] they'll write me all the time asking for
[1:49:40] prayer
[1:49:41] their feeds are filthy cuss words all
[1:49:44] kinds of stuff you know what i do take
[1:49:45] my little finger i go up hide
[1:49:50] so i don't have to see it
[1:49:52] we all need a helmet for our soul folks
[1:50:01] last one the sword of the spirit
[1:50:03] which is the word of god and we know
[1:50:05] it's a double-edged sword right
[1:50:07] that's coming and going
[1:50:10] divides asunder it also
[1:50:14] hebrews 4 12 discerns not only your
[1:50:17] thoughts and and your your your mind
[1:50:20] but it also discerns your intentions
[1:50:26] god knows what we intend to do
[1:50:30] i i've shared this with you many years
[1:50:32] ago but i i don't know if you remember
[1:50:34] me sharing this about brother branham
[1:50:36] when he went out there under that
[1:50:37] complex
[1:50:38] brother brown was going to quit and
[1:50:39] become a trapper
[1:50:42] he hadn't made plans he hadn't bought
[1:50:44] traps he hadn't bought land
[1:50:47] he hadn't even told his wife and his
[1:50:48] kids about it yet
[1:50:50] but god saw what he intended to do
[1:50:53] and give him a vision of standing in a
[1:50:55] trash dump
[1:51:01] so lord
[1:51:03] with thy word not only cut out bad
[1:51:06] thoughts and evil thinking and
[1:51:09] but cut out evil intentions
[1:51:13] don't let me make plans
[1:51:16] let me trust in your plans
[1:51:23] i'm gonna have to quit time's gone
[1:51:26] ain't none of y'all ever gonna believe
[1:51:27] i'm sick preaching this long and none of
[1:51:30] y'all probably made up it's a hoax right
[1:51:34] ain't nothing wrong with that kid
[1:51:35] preached an hour and 40 minutes
[1:51:38] what i'm trying to tell you brother
[1:51:39] sister is at the end of the day
[1:51:42] when paul is dressing this soldier up
[1:51:46] and he's getting us ready for our march
[1:51:49] and we start off in the marching time
[1:51:54] understand this
[1:51:56] the word he said the sword of the spirit
[1:51:58] the word of god is nigh thee
[1:52:04] even in your mouth
[1:52:07] that's why i told you tonight
[1:52:09] your participation
[1:52:12] is key
[1:52:13] to the success of this message tonight
[1:52:17] and in his holy name
[1:52:20] what you speak here tonight and those
[1:52:22] pews
[1:52:24] is going to determine your changes
[1:52:26] when you walk out of here
[1:52:30] father
[1:52:32] thank you this evening time
[1:52:34] for the greatness of your presence
[1:52:38] as your son i'm very grateful lord that
[1:52:40] you've given me the strength
[1:52:42] to be able to preach tonight
[1:52:47] and
[1:52:48] thank you for the tenderness of your
[1:52:49] children
[1:52:50] lord i only preach maybe an hour some
[1:52:52] but i always tease them about being
[1:52:53] long-winded
[1:52:56] i think sometimes lord what we really
[1:52:58] need to know
[1:53:01] is where we stand in all of this
[1:53:05] preachers say so many words
[1:53:08] and we leave out the main part which is
[1:53:10] where do i belong in all of this
[1:53:14] so lord
[1:53:16] i'm stretching my hand over your
[1:53:18] children tonight
[1:53:20] and i'm asking lord god that you will
[1:53:22] come into this place
[1:53:24] and that you'll let every one of them
[1:53:26] find their place and what i've preached
[1:53:27] tonight
[1:53:29] let their mouths be filled with your
[1:53:31] word
[1:53:32] let them speak
[1:53:34] their deliverance let them speak their
[1:53:36] victory
[1:53:37] let them speak their overcoming
[1:53:41] we don't want to barely make it through
[1:53:42] and survive
[1:53:45] but taking unto us the shield of faith
[1:53:48] i want to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:53:50] the wicked
[1:53:52] help us my lord
[1:53:54] in jesus name
[1:53:57] amen
[1:53:59] can we stand to our feet tonight
[1:54:02] says y'all musicians
[1:54:06] hallelujah
[1:54:09] this is what i want to do
[1:54:11] i want us to close our eyes one more
[1:54:12] time raise both our hands
[1:54:15] and while you're standing there tonight
[1:54:17] i want you to speak
[1:54:21] speak your deliverance
[1:54:23] speak your victory
[1:54:26] just speak it
