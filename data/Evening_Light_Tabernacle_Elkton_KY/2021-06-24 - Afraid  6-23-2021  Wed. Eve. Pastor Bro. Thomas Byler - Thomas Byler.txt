which we feel lord that you've laid upon our heart to speak lord we ask god that you just have your way in both the speaker and the ears of the hears to each and every one that hears father we ask god your blessing upon the service now in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen if you will this evening turn your bibles to the book of genesis genesis and my thought and my message came just thinking about adam and how that uh how did he was hiding in the bushes amen i got to thinking about adam hiding how did he got scared amen and so we want to talk about that scared tonight amen but we want to talk about being afraid titled it afraid amen so in genesis did i say one well it certainly isn't one uh let me see just where it is here seventh through 13. so it's probably huh two three all right thank you i don't know why i wrote genesis 1 down but that's what i did all right yes three and seven and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked has thou eaten of the tree aware of i commanded thee that thou should is not and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat amen may god had his blessings to reading in the words you can be seated now we all know that the genesis of course is the beginning chapter it is the seed chapter everything that you find in revelations you will find in the book of genesis isn't that right so as we talk about being afraid we talk about fear so tonight we're going to discuss fear we're going to talk about faith and also love but i want to talk about that being afraid now i don't want to get into this but i want to mention also that if you'll notice that after the fall it and this also carries you know right into our lives uh every man that is born of a woman of course i suppose this will be all the way to the end of time [Music] and that is the next two verses that we find in verse 13 no 12 and 13 when he wanted a man to speak for himself and he asked you know you know what he had done what have you done okay and he said who told you that has eaten of the tree the man said the woman whom though we find that in the following condition of adam it is very hard amen and for for him to just confess his wrong uh what we call i guess passing the book am i right we as human beings we always like to try to blame somebody else isn't that right play the blame game you know and so the man here playing blamed the woman in that right and the woman wasn't any better than the man she's got the same problem she also had somebody that she could blame she says it was that serpent that's who it was it's his fault the man said it's a woman's fault woman said it's you know and so we find here that i believe if i'm not wrong probably god said he's seen a great miracle one time when a man come up and confess he says brother brandon i'm wrong i was wrong you know right amen when you hear that coming from somebody remember lights is flashing and miracles are taking place it's a miracle right because for us to actually take blame upon ourself you know it's just so hard for us to do amen i'm sure that i try to do it because i will say this i have heard in my lifetime being a pastor i have certainly heard it from people right when i know that it wasn't everybody else's fault but yet with everybody else's fault or somebody else's fault i mean i'm like a person just not really good at confessing you know when that's really the best thing for us to do is just to confess adam should have said yeah it's my fault don't blame my wife now i did it no it wasn't that way right and so anyway we find that that's the nature became the nature of man amen and so we find here that the very first thing you notice one of the very first things after the fall is that fear or being afraid came in now when you're afraid of something what is that another word for it would be scared you're scared the scary part of humanity begin to come out after the fall he was afraid let me tell you something people will hide behind all kinds of fig leaves they'll hide behind by all kinds of things because they don't want to hear the voice of the lord they're scared of the lord people don't want to come to church even because you know the lord might speak to him in that right and actually prick their conscience and tell them where they're wrong at people don't like to hear that they're scared of it because they're going to have to face the issue people don't want to face the issue amen so we find that coming from a place of perfection and now coming into another kind of a place no doubt but that adam and eve after they were driven from the garden perhaps they afterwards you know because we know that all of creation fell with adam isn't that right he was made the ruler over all the animals and so when the master of all the animals fell all the animals fell with their master and so they went out from the presence of the lord and amen and we find out that perhaps where he thought he could go up and rub a nice mane of about a lion we find out perhaps that he went out there and that that lion looked at him differently he growled at him and came running at him and next thing we might find is adam up in the tree and saying what the world's going on around here this guy tried to eat me why didn't all of a sudden fear came everywhere you know and every other and every other animal that perhaps was friendly now he isn't so friendly anymore fear fell upon all of creation amen it has become the scary part of all of humanity when that when that happened fear came amen now we know that the prophet taught us that there is absolutely nothing good no virtue no strength at all in fear in being afraid amen and you might be amazed i think if we all searched our hearts in life we might be afraid of how you know how how it gets right down to where we live a lot of times we might not testify to somebody because we're afraid of how they'll react amen we want to don't want to say nothing to the boss because he might say look if you're going to believe that you can't work here um all kinds of things amen we can think about but anyway so we look at that and we realize that is actually it is a state of existence this being is this being afraid is a state of existence it's like an atmosphere being afraid is an atmosphere that a person lives in that is a horrible place to live it'll cause you to go hide frame and hide it'll cause you to blame everybody else it's it's just a lot of things that is terrible about this word being afraid amen it's the opposite of confidence all right when you uh you know if you don't you know if your heart is right with god then do you have confidence in that right that god will answer your prayer the bible said but there cannot be any condemnation the reason that adam had condemnation and the reason that he had fear in the beginning was because he broke one of god's commandments he did something that was wrong i'll tell you what how many knows anytime you do something that is wrong it hurts your confidence with god it hurts your walk with god amen that's what he did he had broke one of his commandments his confidence went he was afraid he was con condemnation come in amen the confidence went out and all kinds of things now notice here i want to say this that amen this place of being afraid is actual and fear it's a place of uncertainty it's not sure it's uncertain he didn't know what was going to happen it's unsolid and shaky place to be is in a place of fear or being scared it's a place of sinking sand amen i like the song we sang on christ the silent rock i said all underground sinking sand the only thing that oh my you think about this we're gonna take it a little bit but we go in here we find that all of this was brought in amen one of the first things it was that he was afraid amen praise the lord and you know the whole world is afraid the whole world has it's bound by fear and i told my wife on the way i said write this down people react and act and they don't even know why they're acting like they are but for the most part it's because they're scared people around the world are scared they might not even confess it they might not say it but they are because you see folks you might block it out of your mind you might block it away but way down in here god has made us as human beings to know something is that right and that is to know that we're going to come to a place of death brother bambi said he's heard people brag and boast and make all kinds of statements but when they come down to the door of death it was a different story isn't that right because he knows that he's got to go he knows he's going to make meet his maker and there's something that in there that is scary about that everybody that doesn't have christ is in a place of being scared a place of not having any confidence a place of fear of what the future holds amen oh my and i want to say that that the place of perfection is to live in the absence of fear to live in the absence of fear is the place of perfection wow that we can live in a place that has absolutely no scare not even death itself scares you how many knows we've had great examples of it ff bosworth different ones it came down to that place of death and they weren't scared paul the apostle paul isn't that right see all the way up till the time of jesus christ coming to the earth the bible talks one place about men were always their lifelong and they always had that fear of death that fear of death was always there the only thing that took that fear and sting of death away was jesus christ and one one way to get rid of that is of course and that is to be right with god adam was no longer right with god and he had every reason to be scared let me tell you something anybody that don't have a christ in their hearts you have every reason to be scared if you're not right with god tonight remember you ought to be very afraid you ought to be very scared amen because the future doesn't look so good judgment waits hell and the second death await amen you should be very scared if you're not right with god just as adam and eve were scared because they weren't right with god paul said therefore having access to god by faith we have peace with god isn't that right being justified so forth jesus christ made that available let me tell you a story i want to base my thought tonight on about the little boy going by the graveyard remember the story so now brother bam says look at the days of lot the perversion the homosexuals oh how the world the whole country most of the government swallowed up with it and everywhere we're meeting lord by devils and power of the enemy the whole world is scared to death even our nation is like a little boy going through a graveyard at night whistling to keep himself from being afraid actually trying to act like he is not afraid amen but he knows that he is amen another place now we realize lord that something is fixing to happen the world knows it they're singing songs and television are bursting forth with neurotical jokes and songs what are they doing they're like a little boy whistling in the dark passing by a graveyard scared to death trying to soothe his nerves by whistling he's only fooling himself so is it with this nation and the world how many knows that that's what all in the whole world i guess so everything is ever about a joke everything is about laughing they're just joking trying to soothe that fear that's down in there trying to get it out of their mind trying to get it out of their mind amen oh my why do you think that our government and our world is trying to get rid of christianity and everything that's right they're scared they fight it with everything i mean they go out of their way to try to make sure that we get rid of this and get rid of that isn't that right take the ten commandments out take prayer they're scared they're just scared they don't want to have to they don't want to bother them but it does bother them amen they are scared internally they're scared but they may not even admit it but they are because they know they're going to answer on the day of judgment amen they know they got it coming this nation knows it's got an atomic bomb waiting for it this nation is going to burn sinners are going to burn homosexuals are going to burn hello all of them is going to burn you think they like hear that they don't want to hear that but it's the truth as long as i'm around as long as god's around they're going to hear it why do you think they want to get rid of us they don't want to hurt but they're scared because they know that it's the truth probably god said the whole world was scared they're scared another place it's because because they're scared how many knows because you're wrong because you're not right with god what does that make them why did adam go and hide huh he got nervous he did you hear the voice of the lord get behind get behind him he was nervous fear comes with neurotic being nervous and didn't brother i'm saying the whole world was a neurotic age it's a nervous age everybody's nervous because everybody knows something's fixing to happen why do you think people tattoo themselves and do uh all of this they're nervous they're scared and they try to soothe that in there by another tattoo or by orange hair i don't know what it is what color is it out there we've seen so much of this what was it gone anymore what color was it blue what's with the blue i'm saying brother jeff everywhere you go man women olive dog got blue hair i'm like i'd at least want to be a little different i'd go with green or purple or something but no it's all blue but what is it all trying to do something down in here according to the prophet listen it is because they're unsatisfied they're scared huh folks i ain't got to paint my face i ain't got to put a nose ring in my row to be happy oh my people just don't know where joy lays do they scared you know when adam took us into the fall when eve took us into the fall he they took us into a scary place scary you better go out there jungles of africa you better watch that man also hunt you it's scary everything's scary folks anymore nowadays how many of us how many people nowadays pack guns huh we have a lot of people why you're scared you never know what might happen and you just want to be prepared for in case something might happen isn't that right my that's right it gets worse all the time but it took us into a nightmare i mean you talk about a horror film yeah that's what adam took us into was a horror film it wasn't much later until people were bashing each other's heads in with rock mccain killed abel murdered him my what a horrible world to live in terrible isn't it right lots of reason to be scared most the biggest reason was is because adam wasn't in relationship with god anymore there wasn't perfect peace anymore that wasn't perfect love anymore that wasn't perfect faith anymore he had to go and work sweat and get old amen so he took us into a scary place amen let me just finish this here that's right he's going by all of these jokes everything that people are doing is just try to soothe their nerves amen they're only fooling themselves then he goes on down and he talks about the white house like the white house we're like a little boy well let me just go back read the whole quote okay listen we run over here and we huddle up our fists they run back this way and and they and and run back nations going back and forth it's scary every nation is scared might as well tell it like the white house like a little boy in the night time passing by a graveyard whistling in the dark acting like we're big and brave all behind all of that everybody is shaking in their boots everybody's scared to death oh yeah and they're just trying to find ways people are pleasure mad people will go drugs mad people will have an island sex island and everything else and go sex mad hello all kinds of things people the world is just that place and what is it because they're scared of what's going to happen and they know what they got coming amen so he said be act like they're big and brave but um everybody's shaking in their boots it's all uncertain oh how many knows there's no nothing certain about this world anymore there's only one place of certainty the only one place of confidence and that is in christ jesus every nation's peace treaty everything else is breaking it's just shaking the u.n shaking amen everything's shaking how many how many know we're shaking more than we've ever shook amen in us russia we don't broke up our treaties this out of the other and china look at the different feuding north korean oh my just all kinds of just falling apart shaking and the bible said that everything that could be shaken will be shaken i mean those adam was shaking this world under amen a place that doesn't accept christ as their rock they're on shifting sinking sand they're on a shaky in a shaky place and everybody every individual that isn't in christ is in a uncertain shaky scary place amen i visited visited my old bishop i think he was the bishop when i was amish he's not anymore he's way too old his wife done died one of his sons died and he reminded me when i went into his house to visit him a lot like my mom's a lot like amish houses when you go in there there's no gospel music playing about as quiet as what you hear right here just quiet but up on the mantle somewhere on the wall they'll all have a clock they'll have a clock and what you'll hear in the quietness is that clock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick it's almost scary it's almost spooky huh like tick tock and i got to thinking about on this here i said you know it's you know even the sound of a clock is scary you know why because the prophet said every time he goes dick huh you only got so many ticks in your life one time it'll go talk and it'll stop huh you only have so much so many tick tocks so many seconds in your life and then you got to go meet the master and there i was listening to the tick tock tick tock talking to him fellowship and therefore different things and he's not quite there all in his mind so sometimes he's with you sometimes he's not and he keeps saying i still know why i'm still up here he's going to go down want to go down he kept talking and wanting to go down oh i don't know why i'm still here talk about spooky fellowship right there talk this man's wanting to die here he's wanting to go he don't want to have him be scroobled up and all just sitting there and wife gone kids there he sits there all day listen to tick-tock tick-tock tell you what i'd be doing some praying wouldn't you make sure i'm ready to meet my maker i want to be like fs bothers or some of the brothers that said who's dying here me or you may be some good old boss my music open the curtains and so forth maybe get to see my loved ones how many you don't have to die in fear fear that doesn't have to be scary when you're ready why because christ took this thing of death out you don't have fear anymore all right let's think about something else do you realize that fear is a weapon that is used in the military fear is that right called i guess it's called shock and awe shock and awe i think hitler used it overwhelming force until it just takes swat it takes the spirit out of the enemy in other words just knock them back and they got no more spirit to fight with feared on set in they are going to who of us hello i hope you knows when you've got that idea in your mind they've whooped you right there then i whooped ya one day you believe that you're whooped because you're not gonna have the muscle to fight amen let me tell you something that's what happens to christians sometimes the devil will hit you with a trial he'll hit you something so hard that if you aren't careful you'll let fear come in instead of the love of god and just let god handle it and god allows the enemy to shock and always a lot of times like he did at the red sea you're like oh man here we see the chariots coming and it was shocking all until they didn't say well you know though he's playing me yet i'll trust him huh that's where he should have stayed shut in with god but they didn't they let that fear grab a hold of them and then they went and acted according to their fear according to their scare god allows us to get scared joke look at job he could have been scared he was in shock and all with what hit him but by god's grace he maintained his testimony the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord one example of shock and awe was with the rahab the harlot jericho how many knows jericho was a mighty city they come into the promised land the first city they come into they were running chariot races up on top of the walls that's a big old wall folks even these children of israel amen those spies that went into that land and they said we're like grasshoppers to them huh let me change the story for a second since it comes to my mind is that all right when when this tactic is used when somebody has the opposite of fear and has courage and that is brave because fear brings cowardice right you become a coward when you have fear in your life and one illustration of a army that let me just say this courage if you can have courage and bring fear into the enemy the enemy can be much much greater than you and yet because fear strikes the heart of that enemy you could actually overcome the much greater army simply because of your care your uh courage and the fear that is put in them that right the illustration that you'll remember when i refer to this is that the swiss but about talked about the swiss how they were never had much of a military or anything but a great big army with all their spears and oh man totally trained that they might come up with a great wall against the swiss and arnold bond and i can't pronounce that last name but i'm gonna call him arnold remember that and he went out there and he says to his friends and his neighbors he says look today i give my life for my country now right y'all remember that i'll never see my wife i'll never see my kids again but let me know that we're going to fight for freedom isn't that right he says i'm going to give my life and he took and he ran towards that great big army and he ran into them and they all put their spears out and they're right and he said he grabbed a bunch of them and probably put a bunch of grabbed a bunch of them and said make way for liberty it scared the devil out of them enemy and that right put the fear of god in them shall i say and brother bob said they routed that into that enemy they never came back with the swiss because what did it do it gave his people courage it didn't matter if they had a pitchfork or an action what they had they went in there and it put fear in that army it scared that army and then it was routed i mean that's when we're routed that's when we're defeated when we let the devil scare us a lot of times we'll get upset we'll get mad because things begin to go a complete different direction than what our what we're used to having as stability is that right and when we let fear come in many times we'll get mad because i mean we want control of the situation because we like to have control in that right and any of us it can happen to any of us is that right when that happens a situation to where men in shock and all we're not used to it and you gotta really relax and say lord help me amen all right so that's one instance of where fear was put into the heart of a great army and the other incident was here in the bible when remember that spies went in and their rahab the harlot they got caught inside the gates in that right i believe it is and they couldn't get out anymore and they were going to find these spies and build out kill them ray had the harlot had a revelation and verse 7 of chapter 2 of joshua says and the men pursued them by the way of jordan hold on a minute yeah she told him they had left i guess hey they don't got out of here go get him find him all right and as soon as they were pursuing after them and were going out they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof and she said until the man i know that the lord has given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us oh my i'll tell you what if we could get that terror to fall on the devil he would leave our premises huh and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you they became weak for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you how many how many knows what are the things that you hear can really take you down sometimes you got to make sure what you hear and what you listen to amen jehoshaphat i believe it was when the enemy came in and wrote him letters that he ought to just surrender and spare life and all of these other stuff and he said all the things they're going to do and then jehoshaphat boy he didn't know what to do but he turned to the lord and a prayer and they're right god says don't be afraid you have good courage all right when you came out out of egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan zion and og who he utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt oh we were big bad and brave but when we heard that our hearts melted folks don't never let your heart melt because of fear or because of something that happens things happen all through life amen neither did there remain any more courage in any man they lost the war right there they lost their courage because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and on the earth beneath amen notice what god told him this was chapter 2 of joshua chapter 1 of joshua god was telling joshua he says verse 6 to be there shall not be able to be any man stand before thee all the days of the life as i was with moses so will i be with thee amen kind of remind me of what jesus told us amen fear not i am with thee i'll never leave thee nor life for safety how many believes that that god is with you he promised never to leave you never to forsake you fear not we have to be absence of the presence of fear in order to be the kind of christian that we ought to be i will not fail thee nor forsake thee but be strong and of good courage amen verse 7 only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all according to the law my uh which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from the right or to the left amen so he says listen be strong and be very courageous i mean let me just make a reference to it because i want to cover more tonight in a short space but another place uh in the bible we find that whenever jesus went up into a mountain to pray and so forth amen and the disciples were in a boat isn't that right and in about the fourth watch of the night which i believe is between three and six o'clock in the morning if i'm not wrong amen jesus amen while he was up there the wind became contrary and the boat began to go way out in the ocean isn't that right and he come walking on the water he couldn't get in there maybe anymore but he come walking on the water the bible says that they were scared they were afraid they were frightened because huh what is this israel are you far sincere is this good or is this bad and jesus said what he says fear not be of good courage amen it is i he said be not afraid it is i the brother brandon preached that message called it is i be not afraid and he said that's how this generation of church people when they see the discernment the thoughts of the heart and so forth jesus coming doing exactly what he did he says don't think that it's beelzebub for mental telepathy or some devil it's not it is i be not afraid i'm at least that's what we had in this generation jesus coming into the same situation and people thought it was some spooky scary thing oh you can just read the minds he can't read nothing it's jesus christ he's earning the thoughts and defense of the heart amen and they were afraid of it my in that right so be not afraid it is i don't be afraid amen i trust that it's the place that each and everybody here if you aren't there yet let's get there get to the place to where you don't have to be afraid amen i was thinking about it having been a nightmare folks how many knows a nightmare is scary it's scary you try to wake up from it and i'll say this on my part i believe that up till the time of christ the whole world was in the nightmare the only thing that changed the dream was jesus christ all of a sudden it turned it wasn't so scary anymore the devil wasn't so scary anymore the bee that stings and of death it wasn't so scary anymore it became a whole lot nicer amen to where you had fear now you have fellowship you have faith isn't that right but in another way let me tell you what brother branham said he says that ever since he got borned again it seems like he was in a nightmare because while we were out there when you're in the world drinking and partying and all that other stuff you know you just fit in you didn't think about nothing you just went with the world it's what you did he didn't think it was so bad but when you try to live and be a christian in this world all of a sudden that is a nightmare out there that right i was speaking with my wife this morning i told her i said we was talking about death and i said since i got saved 30 years ago as a boy ever since then it seems like i'm in a nightmare she says what do you mean amen and i said in this life something has happened down in me that makes me know that there is a land somewhere amen but we can stop there some right there on the somewhere there's a land somewhere that doesn't have what we have to deal with are you with me tonight and we don't have to see all this and we don't have to fight all this amen oh my that we don't have to live in satan's heaven hello is that okay can i say it that way we're living in the devil's heaven and the devil is i'm gonna just kind of go down the side road but hopefully all right this is the devil is fixing to be in the pinnacle of his dream of his goal according to isaiah 14 who he says i will be like the most high i will be worshipped i will be like god and brother brahma says all the denominational churches when they rejected jesus christ when he came this and this generation they accepted the devil's theology they would take what their bible school told them over the proven vindicated word of god they took it over that and by doing so he said they exalted satan to the place that he always wanted to be amen and it never happened never has happened until this generation world over and now every because you're either serving god or the devil it all depends on what you believe that's why the mark of the beast is either in the head what you believe or what you partake of amen that means who you fellowship what you partake of is what you're guilty of and what you believe amen he's coming to the pinnacle of it amen and we call it satan's eden satan's eden we're living in satan's eden amen and i'll tell you what they might like it but i don't no sir we as christians we don't like it i'll tell you what the people way people do you know it's just well it just can't get hardly any worse we keep saying that don't we then it gets a little worse oh my so let me finish the story lets me know there's a land somewhere and i'm shaking myself to wake up someday oh my get me out of here this is not where i belong oh i like that this is not where i belong this is not where you belong death now notice someday death will wake me into his presence did you ever have a nightmare you just wanted to get out of it and you were jerking and jumping you want to wake up because you know there's a reality somewhere that's far beyond that nightmare that's what he said this was where we're living in question does anybody think of something else that brother branham referred to what this world was like something burning what that's right smoldering burning garbage pile that's what this world's like remember he said that's what he's like and everywhere if you ever heard him describe a really really really nasty bathroom i believe it was one that you just closed the door and you you go outside and wipe your feet i don't even want to wear whatever i don't want what's on the bottom of my feet my dudes he said that's also what it's like an abomination everywhere amen everywhere that's what the world's like i want to get out of this nightmare it's scary it's scary they're defunding the police and that's kind of scary oh my they're turning all the people that do something wrong they're turning them right back loose it's getting scary you might not think so much of sitting here today we're out in rural areas but you gave it some time folks when you got to watch out your window wondering who's going to come walking in or when you're going to have to when you're going to have to think of people that you don't know coming to your property as somebody that's going to kill you because that's the only way that you know that's why you're going to have to look at it because you don't know it's sad this world is a bad place getting to be a bad place to live amen but uh all right let's turn to thought for a little bit shall we let's find out how we can get rid of fear get rid of fear the bible says that you're not perfect as long as you have fear would you like the scripture all right let's go into a and i want to say this in first corinthians the 13th chapter and verse 13 it says now by the faith paul says when it's all said and done what abides is faith hope and charity love right let's talk about that for a few minutes first john if you're gonna go with me go with me to first john excuse me four and verse 17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love no fear in love what about if somebody comes up and smacks you what about when somebody trespasses against you when somebody does your own huh wow there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear how many knows that adam lost the love of god when he stepped out like he did that's why he was scared because he wouldn't have been scared if he had the perfect love of god in his heart because fear hath what torment it's not comfort there's nothing good about it even in the hearts of the enemy they were weak didn't have any courage left it wasn't anything good it was not strength all right fear hath torment he that feareth is not me perfecting love that's where i get my statement if you have fear you're still not made perfect in love that's why most of the time we do stuff it's because of fear it's amazing how much we operate a lot of times because we're scared of something rather than just having love if somebody does you wrong and you just love those that despitefully use you huh they'll never dismay you this make you in joshua i believe it's chapter 8 god tells joshua fear not neither be dismayed no matter how big the walls are don't be dismayed no by how big your giant is doctor tells you you god can't don't be dismayed if you're in the love of god just stay in the love of god is that right how many knows that's the most powerful weapon there is to overcome everything is the love of god in your heart folks somebody smites you on the cheek and boy you just want to punch him back it's hard not to huh if you don't have the love of god in your heart you probably will you're not strong enough not to see it takes a stronger person not to than it does to do it that's right that's why jesus said love your enemies pray for them to despitefully use you and that right you know give that to him that asks if you when somebody compels you to go mile go the extra mile he says be ye perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect can you imagine what would have happened to the pharisees if jesus would have gotten mad don't call me a devil you know huh you ain't gonna know me that way i'll tell you what boy can you imagine what he could have done but he always kept his cool he always just said love for him he told him he told them the thing but guess what jesus never allowed fear to come into his heart jesus had no fear our heavenly father has no fear he's not scared of anything amen and we love him because he first loved us and if anybody say i love god and hates his brother he's a liar huh if you if you could hate anybody something wrong with your heart that's quite something that perfect how many knows that perfect love has to be in there now we know that faith is great in that character why faith is really great because it gives us access to what it gives us access to god which is love you know and so i use a tool to get something the tool isn't so much the greatest one it's what i got with the tool am i right that's why paul said you have hope faith love but the greatest of these is love because faith gives you access unto god gives you access into this love amen let me tell you something if anybody has a problem with god or doing what they got what god wants them to do there's only one solution and that is to fall in love with god deeper amen because it is the most powerful force i'll compare the love of god to the love of a mother remember one time there was a house on fire and the firemen couldn't even go into the house anymore there was a mother outside and they says no you can't go in there it's too hot and she did it anyway she went into a house that was burning and she went up there and got her little baby huh she loved that baby so much she ran into that fire got completely disfigured am i right but she didn't mind it that was my baby folks the love of god will make you run into flames burning houses what will it do with you if you've got the love of god in your heart you sure ain't going to hate people hate your brother and so forth brother brandon one time he talked about how that he was out in the middle of that field and a killer bull they had put a killer bull in there and he was crossing over to go pray for somebody he left a it's a game board and he left his gun in the truck isn't that right and this killer bull raised up and he didn't just remember then oh yeah they put a killer bull in here there's no trees the fence is way too far that bull is stomping his feet and he's coming after me now let me ask you this what did brother bottom have did he have faith i'm going to have faith to move mountains here was it faith not what he said he says he felt the love of god come down over him he says he was no more scared than anything no more fear of death because at first he reached for the gun he's going to take care of it himself i'll take care of his problem i may have to pay for the bull but i got a gun and i'll put him down before he gets here but there's no god look for a tree there was no tree huh what we call overwhelming oh oh man death staring in the face i'm going to die but he was close to god i mean his brother bran was close to god and god come down and brother brahms begin to speak to the pool to the bull not the pool and begin to apologize i am the intruder i have intruded upon your property and god has given you a nature to defend your property you don't come on here without my permission huh he began to apologize to the bull and he come but i'm a servant of god now go back and go and lay down and so forth isn't that right bull came right up at him and so forth but it was love that conquered that bull it is love that will conquer any fear in your life that's why i believe that's what we need more than anything is the love of god in our hearts more than all gifts operating this out of the other people doing miracles we want all that but brother man says i would rather have people that have the love of god in their hearts all the rest will take place this is the most needful thing that we have is the love of god because it'll take fear out of your life not in your heart i believe if you even come down to the door of death you even don't have to fear it because we already know what's over there don't we he was showing what was over there so you don't have to fear and let me tell you something how many knows that fear tries to grip us getting scared of things tries to grip us and many times we try to get great control of things because of that fear that's in us rather than just let the love of god flow amen praise the lord so that's what we need we need the love of god more than anything else love conquers everything and if you are perfectly in love with god it throws that scare and that fear out of your life god bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come the state of perfection the absence of fear the presence of perfect love is the state that i believe the bride will be in before leaving this world brother branham where shall we go to make sure that we're interruptions should we go to tucson jeffersonville he said no it's not a place like that a location like that but it's the condition of your heart and that is just gathering christ the king and you'll be ready let's bow our heads how many here would you say i need more of the love of god in my heart god bless you my hands up lord jesus i need more of your love when trials come my way when whatever comes my way lord help me always to be governed and ruled by your love and i won't never have to be afraid i won't have to be scared i don't have to be dismayed lord jesus in any way father if i have the love of god in my heart and let you rule and reign in my life you see the hands that are up father i ask god that you would fill us all more of your love lord jesus so that no matter what goliath comes our way no six no armies of philistines like it was with shamgar he slew 600 of them when fear left his heart finally lord jesus that will that will be how it is in our life when fear goes out love of god comes in the devils have to flee lord jesus we ask god that you'll feel this group of people here both and here father and out there in radio land lord with love of god like never before and bring everything about our life into perspective and under the power of the love of god i love you above everything else father lord jesus we ask god that you bless every heart every mind and soul just now with a fresh feeling of your peace lord let there not be any fear among us let only that perfect love of god rule and reign in our lives take all the scare take the afraid away lord in jesus name amen and amen god bless you brother david all is
