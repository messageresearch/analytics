happy needs grace amen every man should be up i was reading today and it said grace you know what it stands for god's riches at christ's expense and i thought that's pretty good explanation right there so let's bow our heads we'll go before the lord in prayer heavenly father we're thankful lord to be in your house once again tonight lord to bring the word of life lord and we just ask lord that you would quicken the word to us lord that your spirit would move amongst us and and lord it would just minister to our hearts needs and words that would draw us closer to your words that would inspire us and encourage us and words that would help us to identify who we are in this late hour father because lord we don't have much time left father lord we just want to be right and be ready when the time comes we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you we dedicate the remainder of this service into your hands that your will and your way would be done in jesus name amen amen if you will just have your seats for a minute i i don't want to keep you up i got a long reading i kind of want to lay a little background with the thought that come to me and before we get into the reading of the word and i i want to just focus tonight if i could uh focus our thoughts on the holy ghost and uh you know wednesday nights are a little different uh they always are a little different we don't have you know quite quite we got a good crowd tonight but not not like on a sunday but i find it easier myself to speak to 500 instead of 50 so that's just that's just me so i have to get in my get in a comfort zone here to be able to to go but i want to focus on the holy ghost and questions surrounding the holy ghost and because i believe many times we make the holy ghost harder than what it is and getting the holy ghost having the holy ghost how do i know i've got the holy ghost those kinds of questions and and i think it's really easy it's really simple if we look at it so i want to break it down and and when i was thinking about that thought that come on my mind you know i got to thinking about the conductor and we talk about a conductor and an orchestra and we've we've heard that illustration over time many times the conductor and the orchestra and and i just thought more about it i thought what is the responsibilities of this conductor you know what you know we know he guides the musicians he gets up and he keeps he does all this but what are his true responsibilities so i looked it up and i found it really really nice and interesting so the primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify the performers to unify the performers and when i thought about that i thought that makes perfect sense if you've ever seen a been to a musical or a production where the performers are getting ready they're they're all in their own little world they're tuning their instruments you hear where when why you hear the violins you hear the the bass over here you hear the all these different sounds and noises and every single one of them there are professionals they're all great as individuals are you with me god's children are all great as individuals but somebody has to come and unify the performers and pull them together and they're they're working on that and you hear that tick tick tick tick tick tick tick he takes that little baton and he gets their attention what happened on the day of pentecost there was great individuals there and it took somebody to come and unify them and pull them all together into an upper room and unify the group what else does he do he sets the tempo and he executes clear preparations my goodness how much clearer could that be he executes the tempo or sets the tempo he tells us when and where and he keeps a beat and he's executing the clear preparations he made his clear exactly clear what we have to do and what we have to achieve to be able to make it on that day the great conductor and and he says he the next thing i like he says he listens critically he listens critically and sometimes we think we can't even take anything to god because we think it's too small or it's too great it's not important but this conductor listens critically and he he listens critically and he shapes the sound of the ensemble his job is to control the interpretation we had a messenger sent to control the interpretation there's no misinterpretation of the word out there anymore the word has been opened the words went forth the voice has spoken and so he's there to to control the interpretation and the pacing of the music and then this was one i really thought stood out to me and his communication is non-verbal so how many of you this week raise your hand because i want to speak to you have heard from god lift actually a voice that spoke to you this week and told you to do something not me brother david he heard from god lift the ear voice praise the lord that doesn't happen every day that doesn't but most of the time god speaks to us in a non-verbal type state and he does he ensures that the candidates have the playing style and tone that he prefers see you're not just going to go in on any way you want to because god has a purpose he has a he has a plan he has a a a script laid out to the way we have to walk the way we have to talk the way we have to live so he picks these candidates and he looks and makes sure that their playing style and their tone is what he prefers and the last one i like and he ensures that the candidates meet the highest performance standards you see god doesn't accept second place very well he don't want to be in second place he's not gonna allow us as believers to put him in second place in anything we do god looks for perfection amen let's stand we'll go to the bible if we would turn to romans chapter 8. i just i hope that helps somebody that's what we're going to look at today and it just stood out to me and if it's not for anybody in the building this whole message is for me and i'll i'll take because i needed it romans chapter eight it's important to know romans chapter eight here it's a declaration in romans chapter eight it's declaring that those who are who are with christ are more than conquerors romans chapter eight says that those who are with god should not fear anything of this world because god is greater than all things so we keep that in mind as we read here there is there is therefore i think i met yeah verse 1 chapter 8 verse 1. there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now that tells us not much good comes from this flesh and we can all agree to that that anything any thought anything i've ever had in the flesh has not been very pleasing to god for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us watch now who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of flesh so what happens there those who's thinking about fleshly things they're going to try to accomplish fleshly things and more than likely they're consumed with me me me i i i because it's flesh he said but they that are after the spirit that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so those people are about their father's business for to be carnally minded is death to be spiritually minded is life and peace i want to know what is carnally minded what we hear that and we think about i thought what in the world does it really mean so if if you've got your things on things of the flesh we know we're carnally minded but carnal that word comes from the word meat so carney which is a spanish word for meat means you're carnally minded means to live after things that animals live for so that kind of changes the perspective of what carnally mind it is you're thinking like an animal you're thinking about wanting to desire the full desires of animals carnally minded because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god it's impossible but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit of life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that what dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die that's pretty plain but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live keep this in mind that number 14. for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for he have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father which means my daddy or my papa and the little jewish boys there they that's where they come from the little jewish boys if they've got a real personal a real loving relationship with their daddy they call him abba father so number 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we be that we are the children of god god bless you you can have your seats may god bless the reading of the word so i'm going to try to just kind of take my time i don't think i'm going to be long or hold you along tonight i know it's been a probably a week for everybody uh but uh we want to take a little thought here and just kind of break it down i want to mess title my message tonight led by the spirit of who we are and and i know that's a mouthful and it's a lot to think about and but i just want you to break that down what i said led by the spirit of who we are you know last wednesday night brother ben nora he spoke and he spoke to us and he spoke on overcoming and and we overcome by what we overcome by the spirit of god we through the spoken word he said you'll speak into your overcoming and then sunday brother byler spoke on greater is he that is in me so who is he who is he that's god that's the holy spirit that lives and dwells inside of his people greater is he that lives in me than in the world and so tonight i'm going to look at led by the spirit of who we are and i hope we can see as believers that the message as the messages are showing up and as god is showing us who we are this is not just here this is around the around the country and around the world because god is coming into a place that he wants us to recognize who we are so that we can gain an identity and then an identity that we will be needing to get out of this world because this world is coming to a climax this world is coming to a climax and brothers and sisters i'm not going to be dwelling here much longer you're not going to be dwelling here much longer as the song says this world is not my home we're just passing through and when we think about that we're just passing through life is but a moment in time you've heard brother byler speak of it as we get older as we get older time speeds up and you would think as you get older things would slow down but that's not the case time seems to speed up and we're just here for a short season somebody asked me here it was a month or two up to what how old are your boys what grade are they in now i said well carson's a freshman and wesson is a junior and joel said western ain't no junior he's a senior but just like that and it went that quick and i thought man that's right he is a senior he's fixing to go he's fixing to move out go to college he's going to pursue things but life just keeps moving faster and faster and faster and jesus even makes mention of this in in in john chapter 8 the scribes and the pharisees i love this scene because they come to jesus and they're bringing this woman who's been called in the act of adultery and as they bring this woman who's been caught in the act of adultery and they begin to try to catch jesus in a trap they want to try to outwit him and they want to try to to prove that he's not who he says he is or who who he's been known to become and they look at him and they're saying the law of moses says that we're going to stone this woman to death that's what the law of moses says for us to do and i always like to say because jesus he just kneels down and he begins to write in the dirt and he doesn't really pay any attention at all to what they're saying and they keep hitting at him with the law law law let me tell you what moses said moses said we got to do this what do you say jesus moses said we caught her in the very act what do you say jesus and he just keeps his head down ignoring their very their thoughts or their words until finally he stands up and he says those without sin cast the first stone and where was all our accusers they left but did the pharisees and the scribes leave see god works things out in our life god will step up and he'll speak and he'll go to the go to the bat for so to speak and he'll mark things out but your your accusers will never leave they came right back and they started putting more at him and i'm asking more about this law and that law and this law until jesus finally stands up and he says listen i'm not of this world you say what i'm saying we're not of this world and jesus looks at those accusers the pharisees and scribes and he says you're from beneath it but i'm from above i'm not of this world you're the ones that's of this world you're beneath it brother and sister playtime is over jesus looks at these scribes and pharisees and says it's over i know where i stand and we've got to be in a place in this hour that we're living in as we see the world coming to a climax let me tell you it can't go much farther and we've heard that and we've heard that we've heard that but there is so much idiocracy that i see happening in government and the government is going to send this thing over the edge they're going to send this over the edge we know it's going to happen and we've been thinking for years we're going to see it but i really believe we're fixing to see it so we better know we better know if we're being led by the spirit or are we being driven by force see there's difference there are you being are you being led in everything you do you know i find it i think about i find it kind of amusing that people want to talk about led by the spirit they always think they got the preacher in mind i hope father's led by the spirit when he preaches today i hope he's under the spirit when he what about you what about the believers sitting in the pews we all have to be led by the spirit are we being led by the spirit on our jobs are we being led by the spirit when we go to the grocery store and we see somebody and maybe they have a need is god nudging you we're all led by the spirit from the pastor to the church mouse we're all led by the spirit brother brown said i ask you christian friend what if he was dying tonight could america save you i would say that was the same response he got but he says let me warn you let me warn you this was in 59 i think let me warn you get right with god he said get the spirit get acquainted with the heavenly things of that spirit that come down from heaven where holiness stands where angels of god stand where jesus christ stands at the right hand of god in majesty and glory and holiness and power of god he said then you walk as a stranger here because you're an alien here you're not of this world we got to get ourselves into a place that we stand in holy places i'm not there i will be honest i'll be honest if you'll be honest i got room i got room i never got room i need to grow in that area brothers and sisters we become so consumed with the assets and the world here things that really don't matter things that really don't matter when you know i i seen it on facebook and it's just come to me but i seen that picture on facebook it showed the rich man's house and the poor man's house and a rich man's grave in the poor man's grave you know what looked the same a six foot deep hole we didn't we're not taking any houses with us we're not taking any cars with us we're not taking any businesses with us our assets but yet our homes our careers our businesses our fleshly pleasures many times we fail to realize that just how insignificant we make god and we talk about putting god in in first place i wonder if he's even on the top 10 list that hurts but when we die when we die we're going to go somewhere and every day we're breathing think of the thousands of thoughts and images and sounds that go through our minds and through our eyes and through our ears especially if you have to go out into the public think about all this but during that time you know someday if we don't go by the way of the rapture we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna die and every breath you take we're making preparations of where we're going to go we're making preparations of where we're going to go because this you don't just end carson and i we were at a little restaurant that we like to go to in clarksville and i'd seen on facebook that uh one of their employees a young young man had passed away and it kind of it was sudden and i kind of wondered what was what it was i didn't really know i never known the young man never knew him never knew who he was but when we went in to eat and i i seen up front they had a little donation box you know for his funeral and so forth and just looked like a nice young man and i asked i said what what happened to the young man and he said they don't know 22 years old so don't know if his heart stopped or his brain quit they don't know what and i kind of just left it alone because i could tell he he was kind of getting tore up a little bit about it and what the long man carson said he come over to our table and he began to talk he said you know it hit me pretty hard he said he died 22 years old he said it brought back a lot of memories to me he said my sister died when she was 22 years old and he said i'm 34 and he said you know this young man had his whole life out in front of him and then the next statement got me he said but now he ceased to exist and it was the time of the place but i thought my goodness that young man is not ceasing to exist he's either in heavenly place where there's love peace joy where there's happiness or he's where there's weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and torment but he did not just cease to exist and that brought to reality the seriousness of what he had said and i thought my goodness what am i doing for god what am i doing for god what am i doing am i being led by the holy ghost in everything i do am i fully dedicating every better bit of breath and effort that i've got to do something for god because people think they cease to exist jesus said you're not of this world little children neither am i of this world i pray for you and brother branham talks about that he said jesus prayed for his church that they would not be of this world he prayed for him don't be of this world he said i don't care you're not american this is a prophet and we get so patriotic sometimes but you're not american get it out of your head if you want to make it we've got to get to the realization we're not americans we're not jamaicans we're not europeans we're not africans he says you're christians he said you're christians and if you're christian your spirit's from up there he said if you're christian it makes you live holy if you're christian it makes you want to be holy if you're christian it makes you want to act like christ and act like god and your whole desire is on heaven and not this world how i fail my dad and i were driving down the road and was saying right down the road right across yeah right yeah right across the road here mennonite was out plowing a field had a team with five or six horses i said you know i don't think i'm gonna live that way all the time but that'd be pretty neat and my dad he don't have a care in the world he's not worried about his kid making the baseball team not worried about if if you know his his wife's having an affair at work he's not worried about if the husband's out gambling or doing this or that i'm not saying they don't have that stuff but he's working behind a team of horses he don't have all this clutter that goes around in his mind and i thought you know that dad you're right he probably don't have a whole lot of cares not like us because we make our cares we make our cares you know i find out people generally do in life what they want to do you make time for whatever you want to do we had something out it was something to do with the moms the other day something went disastrous i can't remember what it was you know how the devil is and my dad said you know we we should have done that but we didn't have much time i said i had time dad he said well you've been busy so i said don't make excuses for me i've done what i wanted to do i knew that should have been done and i didn't do it so now we pay the consequences he just looked at me okay but we do generally what we want to do but living brothers and sisters living in the spirit means living as a child of god let's look back at our scripture for as many as are led by the spirit of god these are the sons of god for you do not receive the spirit of bondage to fear but you receive the spirit of adoption by whom we cry abba father so doesn't it make sense that the sons of god shall be led by the spirit of god that just makes good sense in life don't it you know i i'm raising my kids i want to be the one leading them i want to be the one guiding them and telling them which way they need to go you better not do this you better go here you better not go there that's my kids and we're sons and daughters of god and god wants to be the one doing the leading but sometimes we get it all scrupled up and we think we're going down the right channels in life well if i go to church you know if i go to church if i read my bible but that's not what paul said paul didn't say as many as go to church these are sons of god as many as read their bible and pray are sons of god he didn't say as many as claim the message are sons of god he didn't say as many as take communion are the sons of god think about that the devil goes to church what was next the devil can read the bible he knows he's in it he sees himself in it he knows he's been all around the message sitting in here tonight no doubt in my mind satan's here tonight and jesus took communion think about it so all these things don't make you sons of god but our text tells us that to be a son or daughter of god that person has to be led by the spirit of god so how are we led by the spirit of god we're guided god simply leads us through guidance he nudges you to do things he brings you here he tells you to do this to do that and it's for your well-being sometimes sometimes it's for the well-being of others sometimes it's when you got a problem he's the solution but he guides you through these ways i'll give you an example we had honey this year and we had more than what we had anticipated i guess but you know with kobe there's no jars those people in arkansas don't work no more arkansas glass shut down i couldn't get enough jars so i drive all the way to cerulean kentucky to a guy who's who's supposed to have thousands of jars and i pull up and i say mr shirk i'm here to get some jars do you have any jars he said ain't no jars in this country to be had i said i don't need about 150 maybe 200 at the most can you can you spare some i've seen him in his warehouse he's i got to have this for our sorghum i said okay i understand he said but you you might try going to all these little bitty stores you might find some that nobody's grabbed yet i'm driving down the road and i'm thinking where am i gonna find these jars somebody's got to have some jars i go to the dollar store wiped out tsc wiped out walmart wiped out kroger wiped out joel's causeway says is it major am i what is it myers what mate whatever it is y'all know what i'm talking about you ladies do they got them up in a little i'm not driving to louisville to go get the jars what am i going to do and then that little still small voice of guidance said hey do you remember bill abel that come by he was a he's he's a a broker for flowers he knows people all over the tree call him i said bill he said yeah what do you need i said i don't need no flyers i said i need jars i said do you know anywhere in the country around me where i could find some jars he said the only place i can thanks a little place in fort campbell just on the other side of the the interstate there it's a little country store a little mennonite store he said they had some go you know which way i went i went in there and i said hey you have any jars yes sir how many you need i said praise the lord i got more jars than i need now i got about a 200 left over but that's just how god leads us and guides us he cares and if you'll follow his leadership and guidance in business in life in in your homes in your marriages in your schools you'll find yourself being led by the spirit of god and you'll find yourself at peace because you know god's in it he draws us he leads us by drawing us he draws us to himself you know it's something about whenever you hear about a meeting close by or something's fixing to happen for church you get a little you get a little angry if somebody don't ask you to come that's if you're being drawn if you want to be closer to god and those services and stuff are announcing those things and god begins to draw you close to him and sometimes when you on another note whenever you get going through life and you find fear or sadness or something comes over you and you just say man god what's going on and he says just come close son just come close daughter and he draws you near to him he's our governing authority we can't even walk without him holding our hand he's our governing authority but what we got to learn to do is to yield ourself and be conscious of the still small voice be conscious of god's leading and guiding and directing us because let me tell you he's not going to force you into anything prophet said he was a gentleman did you know you don't have to go to church no he's not going to force you did you know you don't have to pay your tithes don't worry about it he's not going to force you he'll never force anything on you you don't have to read you don't have to pray you don't have to do any of that stuff he's not going to force any of it on you he's not going to come and and force these things on you but if you're a real christian led by god and you've got the holy spirit that holy spirit is going to tell you i'll be a church when the door is open that holy spirit will tell you i'm going to pay my first fruit to god that holy spirit will tell you i want to read and i want to pray and i want to commune and talk and learn and love you more god that's the holy spirit on the inside now if you feel like you don't have to do those things you might want to check your spirit because as christians we're on free moral agency brother brown said this i never had seen this this little story some of you maybe have i've never called it he said i want to give you a slogan i want you to remember it do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself and you're bound to be right let me say it again do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself and you're bound to be right see you'll come out right if you'll do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself and you'll come out right brothers and sisters we have to do what's right in life i've told my boys from a young age boys whatever you do do it right do the right thing [Music] not because somebody's watching here or not because you want notoriety but do the right thing just because it's the right thing to do if you will do that you'll be all right in life but it's when we try to shortcut it's when we try to do things the back way it's when we try to do a little sloppy deal or something that's when we get into trouble because there's no getting out of it you tell a lie you have to tell a bigger one to get out of that one and it'll catch up with you i got another story i'll tell you in a few months wait till this one comes about you'll like this one but you got to tell another lie to get out of a lie out of a lie out of a lie listen to the still small voice james tells us to submit yourselves to god resist the devil and he'll flee so when you've got thoughts in your mind should i do this should i be going over here should i be listening to this should i be looking at this flea because if you got to question it i can about guarantee you shouldn't be participating this is for our young people how many young people we got we got a few young people say look listen up he said i told my boy here when he was about 14 years old his brother brown talking to billy paul he said stand and hold your hands out like this son he said you're coming to adolescence now a place where i'm away from home a lot and he said i won't be able to direct you he said his mother's dead he said but i want you to hold your hands out like this this is your right hand this is your left hand and he said i want you to look at it this way this is your right hand this is your wrong hand if you're left-handed i'm sorry but he said in life he said you can't be going right and wrong at the same time he said you can't be going right or wrong at the same time you may think you're going right but it's wrong he said always remember where your right is come to that right don't go wrong he said when you're going that way you may think this is wrong he might even think this is wrong he said but it's going to be right you're bound to come out right so this is god this is satan if you follow god and what you've been taught you're going to come out all right he said that's the truth he said just remember anytime you ever get in trouble and daddy comes to you i'm going to spread out my hands like this and say which side did you take has anybody ever heard that you've heard it sister i've never heard him give this illustration but he said he said i'm going to come to you and i'm going to spread my arms out and say which side did you take son you're a free moral agent now the decision is his do i go this way or do i go this way and he said you remember this he said i've raised you up the best that i know he said to your age now he said but you're going out with other boys in high school and college and around and you're going to have everything before you everything before you and he said but remember always hold fast to the right keep to the right and you'll come out all right amen so you ask where does the holy spirit lead us how do i know you know these are the questions people say how does the holy spirit lead us how do i how do i know if i'm being led by the holy spirit maybe young christians sometimes wonder how do i even know if i've got the holy spirit the bible tells us by their fruits you shall know them and there's two truths to that if you've got the holy spirit they're going to know you by your fruits you're going to produce love and peace and joy and long-suffering and forgiveness those are the things that are going to be coming out of you and also on the flip side of that if you've got the holy spirit and you're around people that don't have the fruit of the spirit your spirit's going to be grieved they're going to start talking the way you don't you don't talk they're going to start discussing things you don't want to discuss they're going to start looking at things you don't want to look at and the spirit inside of you if it's grieved and said ooh i don't i don't really this is this is not that's not where i want to be that's a good indicator you got the holy ghost and if people said man that's the most loving person he's so kind he he he's so forgiving to everybody he's just he just he's just a special kind of person there's a good sign people are saying the holy ghost working through you so look let those kind of be two little indicators but what else how else do we know that the holy ghost is leading us he leads us to repentance and this is a hard one for us but you if you've got the holy ghost that holy ghost won't let you be satisfied with doing something wrong or thinking bad thoughts or thinking bad about somebody until you make it right so the holy ghost is constantly leading us in repentance i had a situation i had to make right for 20 years ago a couple of weeks ago it wasn't easy i hadn't thought about it in years had no thought of it until i seen the man and i went up to him and i said i said brother i said i need to talk to you he said yeah what what you got brother brad i said well i tell you what about 15 or 20 years ago people told me some things about you and i said i was young i was i was i was not as stable as i am i said i just was listening and i said i i listened to him enough that i established who you was based on what they said and i said i've held i've held you to their standard ever since i said i didn't know nothing about it to be the truth i said but i've held that and thought of you in the way of the light they showed you to me ever since i said i'm sorry i said i i hate it i said because i think we could have had a an amazing friendship and fellowship with one another and said man he said i've been there before and i thought thank you lord he said don't you worry about that he said don't think another thought about it but it had to be made right 15 to 20 years ago two weeks ago it was made right and the freedom that i felt the burden that lifted off of me i didn't even know i had so today a day after i walk a little lighter because i made something right god told me said hey this guy you got to get this off your shoulders you've carried it long enough you're holding a guy accountable for something he didn't even do how do we know we're being led by the spirit he leads us he leads us to think little of ourself and much of him the smaller i can make myself the greater god becomes that don't matter if you're a song leader it don't matter if you're a musician a singer a preacher laity in the pew the smaller you can make yourself more humble you can make yourself the greater your god will be he leads us unto truth we know we've had the fullness of the word in this hour and to deny that would be denying god so if if people are around this message have turned around and walked away and left the message [Music] they've denied the truth a question a and i'll just leave it at that he leads us unto love you know i find it just interesting when jesus is at the last supper we call it and he's uh he's telling all the disciples about what's fixing to happen and and his his terms his language and they they're they're just kind of bum-fuzzled and can't really figure out what's happening and it says right after he he subbed with judas he dipped in there you know what a couple lines down the next thing he says he says i give you a new commandment he said i give you a new commandment unto you that you love one another as i have loved you right after the one that's to betray him dip bread together as i have loved you that you also love one another and by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another wow that's amazing statement when you think about the scene that jesus knows is about to unfold and who just sold him out and he says i'm going to tell you guys what you've got to do if you want to be associated with me you want to be identified with me you want to represent me you got to love everybody at this table how many wants to be used by god god leads us by our usefulness how we contribute to the kingdom of god how god can use us and the gifts we have the talents we have the burdens we carry for other you know i i want to tell people don't get discouraged if you don't have what what you would you know many people claim the gift of ministering that is an amazing gift the gift of music it's an amazing gift the gift to sing is amazing gift and it is but just the gift to be able to follow the leadership of the holy ghost in your everyday life to be able to contribute to god's kingdom to to lead somebody along the way to draw somebody in how much better is that you say well i never i never preached to nobody what about that little witness you done at the grocery store maybe or at the market or at the gas pump that little gesture of kindness you did where's that person today you may not know but god knows and you know what one soul's worth i don't have to tell you ten thousand words that's being led by the spirit so i ask you tonight and i challenge you if we're sons and daughters of god why don't we start acting like sons and daughters of god representing ourselves as sons and daughters of god representing ourselves every time we go out and in our homes you know a lot of times people can represent out in public but how do they represent at home let that sink in but everywhere you go you're representing somebody's looking at you we were getting ready to go and it's just the way i am i can't i can't help it's the way i am we should go out just just to probably dairy queen somewhere simple and i put on my khakis i put on my business casual shirt i put on my my shoes and hey weston come around the corner i said where are you going dairy queen figures i said son i'm representing somebody i'm representing something everywhere i go somebody's looking it doesn't matter who you are they're looking at you to see who is this person you let somebody come driving down your driveway what do you do you look through the window who is this person what do they represent and everywhere we go in life we're representing brother brown said what kind of men and women should we be what kind of person should we be how should we conduct ourselves ladies and gentlemen how are we to act in this present day we ought to act we ought to be uh real up and going christians we should stand out boldly for the testimony of the lord jesus do you believe that he said you know this story brother brown talks about the slave trade and it's one of the greatest stories i think he ever told he said sometime down in the south lands he said we come down here you know the people go and they buy slaves and and he said they they buy a bunch of them and bring them over here like use cars he said these are human souls and they buy them and sell them and he said they go around and they have legal papers on them and they they just like an automobile and they commercialize it and they sell them and they trade and they sell them off and so forth he said but a buyer came to a certain place to this certain plantation and he said he come wanting to buy some slaves and he looked over there and he said he looked around and he said he noticed a young slave there had his chest out head up chest out and head up and he said he looked around the very rest of them and they look very disturbed and weary he's like because they've been brought out of their homeland they've been captured and brought in from another country of a people they didn't know people they couldn't speak with different people and men placed with women that wasn't their women that's the way that it was a trade and he said they were there away from their homeland they were so sad and they wouldn't work and they would beat them and they would take whips and beat them and beat them and he said he he knew they wasn't going back to home so they were sad he said but not this young man he stuck his chest out he said he was snappy ready anytime there's work to be done let's do it he said the buyer said let me buy that one no he's not for sale he said well i've never seen a slave act like that he's a dandy he said i'll give you more than what five slaves would cost no he's not for sale well what makes him act like that he said what is it that makes him act like that is he the boss over the rest of them no he said maybe you feed him better than you do the rest of them no they all eat in the galley just just all together he said i don't feed him any different he's no balls he's just simply a slave well what makes him act different he said i didn't know for a while he said but you know i found out one day that his father is the king of a tribe in his homeland he said yet though he's a son an alien away from home he keeps the morale of the rest of them up for he knows he's a king's son let that sink in brother brown said oh i thought oh oh god he said though we've alieated here in a dark world amongst unbelief and skeptics and infidels and scoffers and laughter brother stick out your chest he said because we're sons and daughters of the king let's act like men and women of the kingdom of god though we're aliens let's act like sons and daughters of a king let me tell you if you've got the holy spirit leaning into your life and i'm about to finish if you've got the holy spirit leading you into your life you learn to talk a little bit the things you used to say the degrading words the dirty jokes the filthy comments you used to make the hurtful things you said to people you don't say those anymore you talk a little different you walk a little different if you're led by the holy spirit you walk a little different you're a little lighter in your feet now are you with me if you got the holy spirit let me tell you you worship a little different you don't sit out there just hum drum and and worshiping but if you've got the holy spirit you're led by the holy spirit your songs are songs sung a little different have you ever noticed when you go to the meetings and you hear and the holy ghost goes through meetings and through services and then anoints the musicians the fingers are just moving they don't know where their fingers are going they're just moving the singer seeing from a place that they that they normally wouldn't see what is this the holy spirit and the next thing you hear is screams across the auditorium why is that because they're people led by the spirit that know their sons and daughters of god and what god has brought them through the bible says they cry to have a father let me tell you my daddy conquered death hell in the grave my daddy calls the blind to see my daddy calls the death to hear my daddy calls lazarus to come forth out of the grave my daddy walked through the three hebrew children through the fiery furnace my daddy parted the red sea so the children could walk across without muddy feet my daddy let me tell you my daddy he led a shepherd boy to bring down a giant my daddy he fed 5 000 with two loaves and five fish five five loaves and two fish my daddy's the king of kings and the lord of lords who's yours who's yours what are we being led by tonight what are we being led by tonight you know sometimes i think we need a little wine thank you sister becky we need a little wine stimulation wine stimulates on the day of pentecost one of the most beautiful scenes in the bible the why they they say they come out and they were staggering and they were walking along and brother brown said even mary mother of jesus was staggering like a drunk woman why because they said they think they was under the influence of wine drunk on the spirit and brother brown said what the world needs today is an old-fashioned saint paul revival bible holy ghost back in the church and that's what's a matter with the church and that's the reason it's so formal and indifferent i hate to say this but i'm going to say it it's not in my notes it's just coming on the day of pentecost they walked out of the day of pentecost and they staggered like drunk people under the anointing of the holy ghost speaking in tongues that the people couldn't the people said how are those people speaking in that tongue that's not where they're from they were so anointed by god so anointed with the holy spirit and they staggered and people was in awe and said they're drunk and we walk out wondering when we're going to the next restaurant ball game volleyball game where's the next job what we're going to do we're going fishing today what are we going to do something's wrong something's wrong let that sink in stimulation we need the stimulation of wine in the holy ghost we need that stimulation but i tell you what i tell you i don't know if we can handle it i don't know if we can handle it you know jesus warned against putting new wine into old bottles now for some that's interpreted two different ways one is you can't bring law into grace but the way i look at it and the way it makes sense to me is you can't put wine in old starchy stiff dried up vessels because it can't hold it so as believers we got to find ourselves somehow to be able to soften up we got to be under the spirit of god to be softened up so that when that wine goes in there you know how wines made they crush up the grapes they stomp them in their feet they bring and sift all the juice put a little sugar put a little yeast in there and let it begin to ferment they pour it in those skins stopper on it well let me tell you if you're starchy cold on god dried up your hides brittle and fragile and that wine begins to bubble oh it begins to shake see we don't have enough we don't have enough bubble and shaking us you say well we're white folk i don't care what color you are there's nothing wrong with having a little little life about you and you'll find if you'll release yourself you'll find yourself that you enjoy god that you enjoy worship that you enjoy singing that you enjoy being a son and daughter of god because the blessings are numerous but if you put that wine in that old skin you lose it yeah it's gone how many wants pliable skin today pliable skin that the holy ghost can bear and can work in let's stand to our feet that's long enough i got three more pages but we'll shut her down it's wednesday night god's sure good to us i just want to be that vessel i want to be a vessel that god can move through that the conduit an open conduit that god flows through you know the spirit's typed in about three different ways it's water wine and fire think about it i want that water of life to flow freely through me i want the fire of god to make me move in such a way and make me make me so on fire for god and i want that stimulation of revelation of what it is to be full of the holy ghost i don't want anything in this world to hold me back i don't want any pleasure i don't want any any want any desire and that's hard because we're americans and we've got it easy even in this world we live in we've got it easy we we make we have we've got people's got good livings here and we see things we want things and we got to be careful because if you're not careful god's down here wants us up here you love the lord let's tonight bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for the service tonight lord we thank you for your your holy spirit speaking to us and quickening the word to us lord i trust lord that somebody was helped by the service and somebody would be able to realize and identify who they really are and how the holy spirit moves because it's a question that many have how do i know i've got it lord i hope tonight they know by their fruits by their actions by their words by their thoughts by their desires that proves they've got the holy ghost because they love you lord they desire to be here lord they desire to be around your people lord there's a drawing in their life that pulls them close to you to come to you father and everything they want to do they want to put you first lord and if we fail you anyway lord and and we've got it on the wrong end of the spectrum and we've got you way low and other things up high lord forgive us and we'll work on it lord lord we will we're brought to our awareness this night lord jesus things even in my life that i have desired and wanted not needs your supplier needs but you don't supply our wants and our greeds you don't have to but lord i just want you to be first and nothing else matters if i can keep you at first lord lead us and guide us lord in our everyday lives lord as a great conductor we spoke about in the beginning unify this body of christ lord in this church here lord that we may move closer to you that we find freedom the scripture says in the spirit there is liberty which means freedom allow us to be free from bondage free from sin free from unbelief free from doubt free from fear free from anguish through your spirit lord we achieve that thank you lord jesus lord we love you with all of our heart tonight lord jesus we just want to sing to you now worship you lord we tell you know how much we love you through our praise lord in jesus name amen through me holy spirit flow through me
