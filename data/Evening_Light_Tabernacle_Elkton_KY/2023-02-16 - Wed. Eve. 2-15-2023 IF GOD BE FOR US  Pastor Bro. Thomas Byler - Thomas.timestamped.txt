[6:41] in the name of Jesus Christ amen and
[6:44] amen if you will turn your Bibles to the
[6:46] Book of Romans
[6:47] amen we'll just get into the word
[6:49] tonight amen do you want to remember
[6:52] sister Marjorie like Brother David said
[6:55] she does have a heavy load right now
[6:57] with whether parish is at the place that
[7:00] he is
[7:02] amen
[7:03] and and just uh and amen and the things
[7:07] she has to do is just
[7:09] heavy on a person so
[7:12] amen our heart goes with her and trust
[7:14] that God will just bless her in a rich
[7:16] way to bring her comfort and peace
[7:18] during that this time amen
[7:21] amen Romans 8. amen this is a very
[7:23] popular chapter I guess and then
[7:26] certainly one of the uh some scriptures
[7:29] that I'll read is one of the first ones
[7:32] I guess as a Christian as a young
[7:34] Christian that I learned a lot of them
[7:36] by heart amen and they certainly suck
[7:38] out to me and so we want to just take
[7:40] Romans 8 and do a little study from
[7:43] verse 28 down to verse 39 tonight
[7:48] amen
[7:49] amen verse 28 for we know that all
[7:53] things work together for good to them to
[7:55] love God to them who are called
[7:56] according to his purpose for whom he did
[7:59] for no he also did predestinate to be
[8:02] conformed to the
[8:03] image of his son so called and whom he
[8:06] let me all for us who can be against us
[8:08] see that we will go try to get all the
[8:11] way through amen amen and we'll just
[8:13] pick those up as we go so
[8:16] so tonight I have some questions amen I
[8:20] want to ask some questions amen and I
[8:22] will get you to answer them as we go if
[8:25] that's okay amen
[8:27] amen the first question amen of course
[8:29] it's going to be my title and that is
[8:33] God before us
[8:36] amen first of all let's go back a little
[8:39] bit and realize who this is coming from
[8:42] right and that's the Apostle Paul amen
[8:45] amen and there's something that uh
[8:49] Paul amen having war
[8:52] chains a lot of times in his life been
[8:55] in prison a large portion of his life
[8:57] having experienced of course things that
[8:59] we won't mention all tonight but you
[9:02] know he talked about Thrice was I beaten
[9:03] with Roz once left for dead twice was I
[9:06] Shipwrecked and all these perilous time
[9:08] perilous from the countrymen you know
[9:10] perils from here and perils from there
[9:12] y'all remember him talking about he had
[9:14] perils everywhere
[9:16] Paul had a lot of trouble and I think
[9:19] one of the things that Jesus told him
[9:21] when uh you know he said you know this
[9:23] you know I'm going to show you the
[9:24] things that you're going to suffer from
[9:25] my namesake you know and that's kind of
[9:28] I don't know how Paul was introduced to
[9:31] being the minister and that he was given
[9:32] and the things we experienced and so
[9:34] this thought came to my heart you know
[9:36] uh I guess yesterday all had sat there
[9:39] if God before us no doubt I've
[9:42] ministered on it before but I'd like to
[9:44] again if I could amen if God before us
[9:46] amen you know uh now notice the first
[9:51] question that he mentions is what shall
[9:54] we say then
[9:56] um
[9:59] thanks
[10:01] amen
[10:02] amen and the answer is right
[10:06] if God before us who can be against us
[10:09] so say that with me if God before us who
[10:14] can be against us that's the first
[10:16] answer to the first question
[10:23] what I would say to these things Paul
[10:26] says this is what we're gonna say now
[10:28] notice he just got finished saying some
[10:30] things right and uh to these things
[10:33] let's talk about these things for just a
[10:35] couple minutes before we go further
[10:38] first of all he said in verse together
[10:41] for good to them that love God to them
[10:45] who are called
[10:47] according to his purpose
[10:50] amen amen so I wrote down here you know
[10:54] kind of the opposite side we know that
[10:56] all things work together for good to
[10:59] them that love God is that right now we
[11:02] could re-read it and say that we know
[11:04] that hardly anything works out for the
[11:09] good for them that don't love God
[11:13] isn't that right so rewriting it we'd
[11:16] say that you know nothing is going to
[11:18] work out good for them that don't love
[11:20] God and to them who are not called
[11:24] according to his purpose
[11:27] are not in the purpose of God
[11:30] for those that are not in the purpose of
[11:32] God it certainly doesn't work
[11:36] how
[11:37] well
[11:40] we'll get into it and Layman and how
[11:42] that and if I believe it's just a
[11:44] chapter or so later
[11:47] uh let me see no it's not even a chapter
[11:50] or later yeah it is in chapter later not
[11:53] a page later but just across the page
[11:55] because uh God's talked about how that
[11:58] you know how that he wouldn't have
[12:00] Mercy
[12:02] John he would have mercy amen and how
[12:04] that he would uh let me see
[12:08] I didn't intend to put this in here but
[12:10] I will verse 22 he says what if God
[12:13] willing to show his wrath in chapter 9
[12:16] verse 23 I see it amen willing to show
[12:19] his wrath and to make his power known
[12:24] oh
[12:25] and do it with long with much
[12:27] long-suffering vessels of Wrath fitted
[12:30] for to destruction so that he might make
[12:33] known The Riches of his glory on the
[12:36] vessels of Mercy we
[12:38] she had a far prepared unto Glory
[12:43] look at how God makes his Wrath
[12:46] known
[12:49] isn't that right
[12:50] Amen on perhaps we would say on the
[12:54] vessels it says uh vessels of rat
[12:58] fitted for Destruction
[13:01] in other words those that are not in the
[13:02] will of God not in the purpose of God
[13:05] not in
[13:07] um what did I call it the plan of God
[13:13] plan his plan is
[13:15] his will and that's one thing that
[13:18] everyone
[13:19] so we want to look at that what if God
[13:22] is for it my mama for a Christian I
[13:24] would just think I think about
[13:26] you know in other another thing that we
[13:30] could call about if God beat not for
[13:32] be with us amen
[13:35] if God be for us or if God be with us
[13:39] who can be against us amen
[13:43] so we see
[13:44] nothing
[13:46] works
[13:49] good for those that don't love God or or
[13:52] people even that claim the love of God
[13:54] but don't really love God
[13:57] amen all that one scripture back and and
[13:59] mentioned it later on
[14:02] so now we now let's go verse to 29 let's
[14:05] take verse 29 for whom notice Paul said
[14:08] for whom he did
[14:11] also did predestinate to be conformed
[14:17] that he might be the firstborn among
[14:18] many bread and I won't expound on that
[14:21] very much but I do want to go to the
[14:22] next one he says now notice the
[14:24] foreknowledge of God is doing 29 and
[14:26] then he talks about moreover in whom he
[14:29] did predestiness so-called
[14:32] and whom he called them and he also
[14:33] Justified and whom he justified and he
[14:36] also glorified so there is a four stage
[14:39] work that God does on the belief
[14:43] if you'll notice here it's about what
[14:46] God did isn't that right it's about what
[14:49] God predestinated
[14:53] says you know you are already
[14:58] fine
[15:00] so he's already done it
[15:03] but Brandon explains it that you have a
[15:06] glorified you drop dead before this says
[15:08] service ends there's a party waiting for
[15:10] you a glory
[15:12] he's done all of that isn't that right
[15:14] things if God be far too can be against
[15:17] this
[15:18] Hallelujah
[15:22] now I know let's go on down to we
[15:25] chopped we covered 31 let's go to 32. he
[15:28] that spared not his own son but amen and
[15:33] put him on Calvary maybe amen if he took
[15:37] his own son put him on the
[15:42] what bigger thing can you
[15:45] do
[15:48] what bigger thing could God do for us
[15:52] then they give his only begotten son
[15:54] whosoever
[15:55] shot me
[15:57] even him should not perish
[15:59] so everything's I look at this
[16:02] now that I wouldn't
[16:04] give you all these other things if he
[16:07] didn't
[16:09] share that
[16:10] he gave you that surely he'll give you
[16:13] everything else
[16:15] amen how many believe that
[16:18] freely give us all things and I thought
[16:21] about that how did God give us all
[16:22] things
[16:24] and I remember the scripture
[16:28] you may not mean those rich people need
[16:31] to keep the minds right
[16:33] don't get all puffed up
[16:35] that's right that high-minded nor trust
[16:38] and uncertain right
[16:40] cheers
[16:42] I want you to understand where I come
[16:45] from people believe
[16:47] in you having it hard
[16:50] they don't want you to have no air
[16:51] conditioner they don't want you to have
[16:54] it's going to be rough tough and
[16:56] everything else but the Bible says in
[16:58] God give us richly all things Trend
[17:00] y'all
[17:03] how many believes that's the way God
[17:04] looks
[17:06] my you know aren't you glad to have a
[17:08] serve a God Like That
[17:11] so we see here that God gave us all
[17:13] things freely to enjoy I'll tell you
[17:17] what I like it you know because I don't
[17:18] just look at that as worldly possessions
[17:20] but how many knows did God give you the
[17:23] Holy Ghost
[17:25] folks if you don't enjoy church
[17:30] huh if you don't enjoy the presence of
[17:33] God I found my daily
[17:36] pieces
[17:39] I don't know about you but I enjoyed
[17:41] that's what I every day I think about
[17:43] God what is surprises even Peter and
[17:45] them amen they want to do they didn't
[17:47] want Jesus to leave but if Jesus said
[17:49] man
[17:50] if I don't know the comforter will come
[17:52] I have got to go to the Comfort
[17:54] aren't you glad the comforter came
[17:57] aren't you glad
[17:59] you can have comfort this evening
[18:03] he's really giving you comfort and peace
[18:07] oh my when you think about all that God
[18:09] has given you remember the Little Flower
[18:11] brother man talked about amen and the
[18:13] rich man or the poor man wanted to be
[18:15] rich or whatever he wished he would have
[18:16] diamonds and that flower took him into
[18:18] that in the mountain and gave him
[18:19] diamonds and pearls and everything only
[18:21] one condition you gotta take me with you
[18:23] wherever you go
[18:25] and in the end he left the flower in the
[18:27] mountain he had a little bit of gems and
[18:28] so forth going to destroy them but the
[18:30] mount closed up because he says you're
[18:32] forgetting the most
[18:33] important thing
[18:36] that is me
[18:38] how many shots the way it is in this
[18:40] world people have forgotten the most
[18:41] important thing and that is the Holy
[18:43] Ghost that's Jesus Christ
[18:47] every good thing every good gift comes
[18:50] from above
[18:51] every good thing that you enjoy is comes
[18:54] from almighty God

[19:06] oh aren't you glad that he's giving us
[19:09] freely all things
[19:11] Amen to enjoy these things
[19:13] if he's staring at his own son won't he
[19:15] give you what you ask for
[19:19] sure
[19:22] amen I've been wanting to preach or
[19:25] demonstrate on preaching a negative
[19:28] message
[19:31] just give a little illustration
[19:33] you know
[19:35] people that believe there's such a thing
[19:36] as the Holy Ghost I know Holy Ghost
[19:41] the people thought
[19:43] always happy you got a smile on their
[19:45] face and act like they're happy I don't
[19:46] think they're really happy
[19:48] huh
[19:50] these people think that they can live
[19:52] Victorious and all these other things
[19:54] and you know that the the Miracles are
[19:57] for today they're not for today that was
[19:59] only for the apostles and so forth
[20:01] can you imagine preaching a negative
[20:03] people think that they get healed nah
[20:06] that's just their body healing them or
[20:08] whatever
[20:11] I wanted to preach some other time but I
[20:13] thought about man you know because let
[20:15] me just sum it up a little bit because
[20:16] there that you can easily you could
[20:18] easily be consumed by these things
[20:21] it could easily come into your mind
[20:24] but that's not what the gospel is
[20:26] the Holy Ghost is always positive it's
[20:28] never negative the word of God is not
[20:30] negative it's always positive the Bible
[20:32] says the promises of God are yea
[20:35] you know
[20:37] yes not no
[20:40] the positive amen
[20:42] praise the Lord I believe that's what
[20:44] Paul was realizing here you know man who
[20:47] can be against us
[20:50] we need to enjoy it Lord

[21:22] do you think that person will have any
[21:24] part and ever justifying you no
[21:28] you justify you

[24:32] gotta commit your case to Christ you
[24:34] gotta commit it won't read the whole
[24:36] quote but remember I was just reading it
[24:38] and I got it here but he says I went
[24:39] into a little store a man in one of the
[24:41] sisters were in there and she says he
[24:43] was six
[24:44] years old and I promise you I have
[24:48] learned
[24:50] my heart
[24:52] twice the 12 years old and I studied and
[24:54] I realized hey I commit my take care
[24:58] I sure can
[25:04] but she was young and she was worry-free
[25:06] and that's what was preaching on let off
[25:08] the pressure you don't have to have all
[25:09] this pressure you don't have to be under
[25:11] all this stress when you commit your
[25:13] case to God
[25:15] just sit back and watch him work
[25:20] yes I mean it how many plan for that
[25:22] mediator
[25:24] when you fall short when you do
[25:27] is that something
[25:29] oh my
[25:31] not attorney
[25:35] s
[25:36] to mind
[25:39] he can turn the minds of anybody did
[25:41] with pharaoh
[25:42] we will talk about Pharaoh for you at
[25:44] our example here for tonight a little
[25:45] bit of how God takes your case
[25:48] amen
[25:49] when we think about
[25:53] oh
[25:55] okay
[25:55] think about this
[25:58] make US enter to
[26:03] if God
[26:04] before us
[26:07] who can be against us and I thought
[26:10] the on the opposite side of that let's
[26:12] look at the other side of that the other
[26:14] side of that
[26:17] if
[26:18] God's nice God
[26:22] huh
[26:23] because somebody knows many many are
[26:26] in many many cases God is not for you
[26:31] folks you're on the wrong side
[26:35] if God ain't for you you're in a heap of
[26:37] trouble
[26:40] how does it say he says who can be
[26:42] against us I wrote in there or thought
[26:44] who can help you
[26:48] who's going to help you
[26:50] if God is against you
[26:53] I'll tell you what there is nobody there
[26:55] when
[26:56] Nathan and Cora in that right when Cora
[26:58] rose up and said what he said and the
[27:00] Earth swallowed him up
[27:02] there was no Wing man there was no
[27:04] helicopters there was nobody coming and
[27:06] swooped in and saved him
[27:08] God is against you but you are in a heap
[27:10] of trouble
[27:12] you're out of
[27:13] the will of God you are in a heap of
[27:15] trouble
[27:19] AMU how many knows God is either with
[27:21] you
[27:21] or he's against you
[27:23] you either Fork
[27:27] so what people
[27:29] do it to the sons of God they don't
[27:33] you better watch we better watch how we
[27:35] treat each other
[27:36] what we say about each other and if
[27:38] we're against each other somebody's in
[27:41] their own
[27:44] it's not a God I'm both besides it's God
[27:48] on one side and the devil on the other
[27:54] scripture because in that day remember
[27:55] on that day he'll say you know as you
[27:58] have gone on to the least of these
[28:02] God's here either for God or you're
[28:05] against God and as you
[28:07] amen are with God's people
[28:11] or against God's people
[28:18] is how you are with God
[28:21] amen again again let's go a little bit
[28:24] longer
[28:25] it's a rough road to be against God
[28:34] you know Saul I mean no Saul before he
[28:38] was Paul
[28:39] he was against God
[28:42] he thought he was for God and he was
[28:44] exuberant and he was very very zealous
[28:47] in what he was doing but the more people
[28:50] that he put in jail the more he hurt
[28:52] than in his other City there's all kinds
[28:55] of boys he was probably overwhelmed with
[28:57] this job
[28:58] what am I going to do the more I rest
[29:00] the more the more pop up
[29:04] isn't that right
[29:07] and that's what
[29:09] that's the answer
[29:10] in the morning
[29:11] never come against
[29:13] the more rose up
[29:16] you couldn't stop it
[29:18] because you can't stop God's program you
[29:20] can't stop God's will
[29:23] you can even kill him but one thing's
[29:26] for sure you won't you will conquer him
[29:29] you could feed him the Lions you can
[29:30] burn them at the stake and you can do
[29:31] all kinds of things you can kill their
[29:34] body
[29:35] but you can't never separate them
[29:37] amen you can't stop the will of God
[29:41] amen
[29:42] because listen to this this very very
[29:45] simple thing
[29:48] well brother do you believe this well
[29:49] brother be careful how you answer he's
[29:51] wanting you to agree with him
[30:02] to be in agreement with how can to walk
[30:04] together unless they
[30:05] agree
[30:08] he's happy now
[30:10] what do you think
[30:12] they killed all those millions of
[30:14] Christians just kiss the cross
[30:17] huh
[30:19] which was idolatry and you they knew it
[30:21] because they were worshiping the cross
[30:25] they would just renounce this or this
[30:27] out of the other
[30:29] amen all the devil wants to do is greed
[30:31] that's why
[30:32] Pentecostals methodists wesleyans and
[30:34] all of these they don't have to change
[30:36] their religion did you hear an agreement
[30:38] with them because Paul said what
[30:39] agreement does
[30:41] bail happen
[30:43] Christ and so stories of what Pricks are
[30:45] and what all this out of the other are
[30:47] and I don't know
[30:48] but I'm just going to tonight interpret
[30:50] it in my own way of
[30:52] thinking you
[30:56] it's all right because a prick
[31:00] or or take a needle and prick you right
[31:03] something that's kind of really hurt
[31:06] it's not gonna be comfortable
[31:09] whatever you're kicking against if it's
[31:11] bunch of Swords it's gonna be terrible
[31:14] can you man I wouldn't kick burn wines
[31:15] would you you
[31:17] wouldn't kick
[31:18] more than once
[31:20] you'd stick yourself up into them big
[31:22] old Thorns I hate going through a Wilson
[31:24] and rubbing against these thorn trees
[31:26] because they are brutal
[31:28] and it wasn't he a who had a crown of
[31:31] thorns stuck him down down in his head
[31:33] and everything it was horrible all right
[31:36] Paul found that it was hard it was hard
[31:38] for him to go in the way that he was
[31:39] going
[31:41] why because he was fighting against God
[31:45] he was not for God God was not for him
[31:48] but against him he was against God until
[31:51] God turned him around
[31:54] amen
[31:57] first how about the Pharisees let's talk
[31:59] about them a little bit how many they
[32:00] were always against Jesus
[32:04] always try to catch him in his words
[32:08] tried to put that woman right out there
[32:10] in front of him and this is what the
[32:11] Lord says
[32:13] but yeah just the right answer
[32:16] always
[32:18] and every time they ask him about
[32:19] marriage divorce about and I just read
[32:21] this the other day
[32:23] I was reading and
[32:26] look where Jesus was being crucified
[32:28] they were saying to follow they believe
[32:31] it was that he's saying that we should
[32:34] not a tribute to Caesar what he said he
[32:37] says whose description is it Caesar he
[32:39] doesn't give unto Caesar to things but
[32:41] yet they they said they don't
[32:45] want to pay talk to me
[32:47] all right like a devil
[32:50] I was like they actually came right out
[32:52] there and just straight out lied
[32:54] but isn't that like
[32:57] amen
[33:00] but anyway so think about that
[33:03] the fair
[33:06] peace
[33:07] finally they finally got him killed
[33:11] is that right
[33:13] it finally killed Jesus
[33:17] they thought well maybe it was done
[33:22] right
[33:24] it was fun
[33:26] yeah he put it in who
[33:29] you know what
[33:30] we better secure that two million raise
[33:32] in three days and all these other stuff
[33:34] and if he raises up man it's gonna it's
[33:36] your country
[33:39] go and say look he went to talk about
[33:41] you know about the bodies being stolen
[33:43] away let's
[33:44] to say even
[33:46] after the tomb was oh even after it was
[33:48] opened
[33:50] they went in and said let's get in the
[33:52] green and it's to this day
[33:54] that somebody stole his body away
[34:00] but this
[34:02] stop God no they couldn't stop God
[34:04] everything they did failed just like
[34:08] pharaoh
[34:09] everything he did failed I want to tell
[34:13] you something you fight against God
[34:14] everything you try to do will fail and
[34:22] amen Pharisee
[34:25] they getting they couldn't uh they
[34:29] couldn't stop it could they
[34:31] no
[34:37] and that is Pharaoh we're going to go
[34:39] back into it pharaoh
[34:42] and he was
[34:43] wrote about
[34:49] when he got to talk about this
[34:52] foreknowledge and the vessels of Wrath
[34:54] and what God does and he does what he
[34:57] wants to do in the up here above uh
[35:00] verse 14 knows that that's the truth
[35:01] Cosmo shows Mercy on who we will and
[35:03] whom he hardeneth he will
[35:06] so what shall we say then is there
[35:08] unrighteousness with God God forbid for
[35:10] he saith to Moses I will have mercy on
[35:11] whom I will have mercy and I will have
[35:14] passion on
[35:16] whom I would have compassion so then it
[35:19] is not him that willeth nor him that run
[35:21] us but it's God that showeth Mercy
[35:23] for the scriptures have unto Pharaoh
[35:26] even for this same purpose have I raised
[35:28] thee up that I might show
[35:31] my power in thee and that my name might
[35:35] be declared throughout all the Earth
[35:39] so even in the New Testament Pharaoh is
[35:41] given as an example that God does what
[35:44] he wants
[35:46] amen
[35:49] thinking about pharaoh and how hard he
[35:52] was kicking against the pricks
[35:56] and I was listening I think I had had a
[35:59] playing out in the barn
[36:01] or somewhere out there and I had it
[36:04] playing Amen in
[36:07] Exodus in
[36:10] somebody was really asking to be
[36:13] forgiven one more time and so forth and
[36:15] I thought it was
[36:16] Fair oh sure and I went back and looked
[36:20] it was him
[36:23] the scripture saith where we just read
[36:25] about the scripture sayeth for in this
[36:28] the have I raised thee up that I might
[36:29] show my power in the exposes
[36:33] in the morning instead
[36:35] of him Dustin
[36:38] Lord God
[36:40] of the Hebrews let my people go that
[36:43] they may serve me for I will at this
[36:46] time send all my plagues
[36:48] upon thine heart
[36:51] he says
[36:53] and upon thy servants that there is none
[36:56] tight knee in all the Earth
[36:59] for
[37:01] now I stretch out my hand that I'm a
[37:04] smite thee and thy people with
[37:05] pestilence
[37:08] and thou shalt be cut off from the earth
[37:10] and in very deep
[37:15] for this cause
[37:18] have I raised thee up for that mind name
[37:22] maybe the
[37:23] declared throughout all the Earth
[37:28] amen
[37:31] wow and he talks about how it he uh
[37:34] sinned hail and killed all their cattle
[37:37] except
[37:38] for Goshen hello in verse 26 into
[37:42] anybody listens anybody that let me go
[37:45] back a little bit verse 20.
[37:54] houses and he that regarded not the word
[37:57] of the Lord left his servants and his
[37:59] cattle in the field
[38:00] so whoever regarded the word went and
[38:03] got that cuddle in their servant sin so
[38:05] they wouldn't get killed later on it
[38:06] says you know that it happened and
[38:08] everybody that didn't regard it they all
[38:10] got killed by the hail and fire Amigo
[38:12] with fire
[38:13] but in verse 20 says but in only in the
[38:15] land of Goshen where the children of
[38:16] Israel were was there no hell
[38:24] the wicked he don't that punished his
[38:27] people would
[38:29] and called for the Lord is and I and the
[38:33] people are
[38:34] coming out of Pharaoh's mouth
[38:36] repentance
[38:37] isn't that right
[38:40] entreat the Lord for it is enough that
[38:43] there'd be no more Mighty thunderings in
[38:45] hell and I will let you go and you shall
[38:49] stay
[38:50] you know
[38:51] longer I remember at the beginning of it
[38:54] before Moses ever did anything many
[38:56] times different times through it he says
[38:58] no I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart
[39:01] and then that'll let you go
[39:03] and many times he said that in different
[39:06] times he said and then right now read he
[39:09] says Moses went out stopped it all down
[39:12] in verse uh 35 and the Heart Pharaoh was
[39:16] hardened neither would he let the
[39:18] children of Israel go as the Lord had
[39:19] spoken by Moses
[39:23] I can just imagine that pharaoh
[39:26] was frustrated with himself
[39:30] huh
[39:36] dude what is wrong with me
[39:42] I say that because another time and a
[39:45] couple of times like that he he said go
[39:49] when God hardened his heart he went all
[39:52] the hardship was over but I mean if you
[39:55] want to be on God's side not the devil's
[39:57] side
[39:59] amen
[40:01] because
[40:02] God does what he wants you know oh my
[40:04] listen to this I'm going to say
[40:06] something that comes to mind didn't have
[40:07] it wrote down but if you won't believe
[40:09] the truth God will give you over to a
[40:10] reprobate mind and you'll believe you're
[40:12] right and you'll go straight to Hell
[40:13] believe in your right
[40:15] efficiently leave a lie and be damned by
[40:18] the Bible
[40:19] God help
[40:21] Lord help me don't ever let me get in
[40:23] that way but if you turn down
[40:26] truth
[40:29] that's what will happen the Pentecostal
[40:31] world
[40:34] is seeing the truth
[40:36] and they turned it down rejected it
[40:41] and it's sad folks we're talking about
[40:43] millions of people
[40:48] amen
[40:50] so we see here that God does what he
[40:53] wants Sony
[40:55] amen and
[40:57] he owned down until the last one we know
[41:01] the last one was when all the firstborn
[41:03] got to all the firstborn
[41:06] they all got ready to leave
[41:07] even that was last
[41:09] time he finally said let him go and they
[41:12] went
[41:13] well I Repent it wasn't the last time
[41:17] that he hardened his heart
[41:20] that's right I mean
[41:23] come out of town
[41:26] somebody still I just can't let him damn
[41:30] hell man you had to tell him something
[41:31] something wrong with him because after
[41:32] all the places
[41:34] please to fly
[41:36] I
[41:37] it's a lighter the
[41:40] the hail that burned everything the
[41:41] locusts eat everything up that wanted to
[41:44] turn the blood
[41:46] Can't Let It Go
[41:50] ma God kept him
[41:52] in the scriptures I want you to know I
[41:55] am God I do what I want
[42:00] amen
[42:02] but nonetheless
[42:05] on the other flip of the coin remember
[42:08] Prophet God taught us that when you're
[42:10] in the line of duty
[42:12] when you're in the
[42:13] there's nothing that can stand in your
[42:16] way
[42:17] he told Joshua and Joshua when our first
[42:19] chapter is I was with Moses so will I be
[42:22] with you
[42:24] go and possess the land no man shall be
[42:26] able to stand before you
[42:30] I mean he's glad that that's not
[42:36] nothing of your God's child amen and
[42:38] your God is with you get cannot overcome
[42:40] you
[42:42] it'll never conquer you
[42:47] oh I stand as a witness to that
[42:49] no weapon formed against thee shall
[42:53] stand
[42:59] try everything
[43:01] the devil will try everything
[43:09] but if God
[43:11] is with you
[43:13] don't fear
[43:15] of death
[43:16] I will fear no evil no evil for that
[43:21] with faith
[43:22] amen as I walk every day I tell you the
[43:25] greatest treasure the greatest pleasure
[43:26] I have is to know that he is with me he
[43:29] walks with me
[43:31] he talks with me
[43:36] we still walk with them to talk with him
[43:39] with him
[43:40] Health in your heart
[43:42] peace with me
[43:49] you ain't excited about that
[43:52] I'll hit you a little bit
[43:54] give you pleasure
[43:56] huh because that gives me pleasure
[43:59] you know he is with me
[44:04] no you shouldn't drink
[44:08] return to the devil you'll just be more
[44:11] miserable
[44:12] I like that when I got to thinking about
[44:14] these things I thought wow
[44:17] what what
[44:18] great things
[44:21] what great things that God has for us to
[44:24] know
[44:25] you've got before you
[44:28] commit your case of God
[44:33] I didn't even get to the good part you
[44:34] ready for the good part here it comes
[44:37] not only is he your attorney
[44:40] but he's already the man and that is
[44:43] paid your penalty
[44:48] that if you accept him as your attorney
[44:50] he's not all the Earth
[44:52] anybody's also the one that is already
[44:55] you think you penalty
[44:57] because I paid for it and he has
[44:59] accepted what I have done he has
[45:01] accepted me as his attorney and I'm
[45:03] pleading his case
[45:06] the price is already paid
[45:08] there's not no ground condemnation to
[45:10] them that are in Christ Jesus well not
[45:12] after the flesh but after the spirit
[45:15] that is the only attorney
[45:17] he's also the sacrifice
[45:19] he's already went to the cross for it he
[45:21] already paid for the bad deed that you
[45:23] really did do all you got to do is
[45:25] confess your faults confess your sins
[45:27] how many is late that's all you got to
[45:28] do is confess confession is so powerful
[45:31] because when you confess it he says he
[45:33] is faithful to forgive you
[45:36] any of your sins
[45:37] to take your case
[45:39] praise be to God
[45:44] amen

[49:43] stray but he never Strays from us his
[49:46] love
[49:47] is
[49:48] elective love and he hangs on whether
[49:50] you do or not he'll not let you go

[49:55] praise be to God
[49:57] all right

[50:41] and this out of the other no no not
[50:42] interested
[50:43] offer brother Brown airplane
[50:45] plane rides and this that or the other
[50:47] just compromise on the godhead a lot of
[50:49] baptism circumced a little bit he says
[50:54] what about principle ities
[50:57] what about powers
[50:59] what about things present
[51:02] what about things to come
[51:05] what about Heights preacher
[51:09] lion or die
[51:11] here
[51:12] no
[51:14] nothing
[51:16] shall be able to separate us from the
[51:18] love of God
[51:19] which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[51:24] I wrote down on the bottom of that I
[51:26] actually wrote in my Bible
[51:30] because if God is for it
[51:35] against us
[51:38] because it's God in you
[51:43] David said do I walk through before thou
[51:49] art with me
[51:54] Jesus said in the New Testament
[51:57] in the 15th chapter of John he says if
[52:01] ye abide and ask what you will
[52:06] and
[52:07] it should that make
[52:10] you
[52:11] omnipotent why how many is all power in
[52:15] there
[52:17] no done
[52:19] unto you
[52:21] when he is in you omnipotence is in you
[52:25] you don't have to fear anything
[52:30] nothing is greater than the love of God
[52:33] and God being with you David didn't have
[52:36] any problem with the bear the lion or
[52:38] Goliath or the 10 or 50 000 Philistines
[52:42] how many of those Goliath was scary
[52:44] perhaps
[52:46] since 50 000 are coming at you David
[52:50] 50 000 if your army loses guess whose
[52:52] head's going to be on the stake how many
[52:55] Saul's Ed ended up on a stake
[52:58] but they were coming after him so he had
[53:00] to have a whole lot more faith than just
[53:01] the Goliath or the bear he had against
[53:03] the whole armies
[53:05] but he said he could he would fear no
[53:07] evil for thou art with how many because
[53:09] you don't have to fear anything
[53:12] not even death
[53:13] if he is with you
[53:16] nice for you
[53:18] nothing can be
[53:21] a gift
[53:24] don't you see how that should just do
[53:26] something for us
[53:27] if you do not know that he's for you
[53:31] he's proven to you that he's been with
[53:33] you time I'm in time and time again
[53:38] don't doubt him amen I believe he's with
[53:41] you
[53:42] even in us to the end I'll never leave
[53:45] you nor forsake you
[53:48] I will be with you and if you notice how
[53:51] Jesus says if you abide in me and he has
[53:53] two parts
[53:55] because there's a lot of people
[53:57] that says well I mean Christ
[54:01] but then you don't do what Jesus says
[54:05] he said and my words
[54:08] abide in you
[54:09] if you love me keep my Commandments
[54:12] right
[54:13] people don't want to do what he says but
[54:14] they want to be don't don't he's done
[54:16] broke it right there
[54:18] huh you don't have to do it
[54:21] the thing

[54:26] done
