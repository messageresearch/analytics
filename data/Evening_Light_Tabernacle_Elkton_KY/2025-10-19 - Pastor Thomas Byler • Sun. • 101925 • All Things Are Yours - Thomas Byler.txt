[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey, hey, hey. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Good morning. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand. Brother Josh, would will you open the service with a word of prayer? Amen. Children could be dismissed to Sunday school. Let's open the Bible to the book of Psalms. Let's read from Psalms 46 to 47. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, say &gt;&gt; God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. God shall help her and that right early. &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Sailor &gt;&gt; He maketh wars to cease unto the end end of the earth. He breakth the bow and cutth the spear in thunder. He burneth the chariot in the fire. &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Sa &gt;&gt; for the Lord most high is terrible. He is a great king over all the earth. He shall choose our inheritance for us. The excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Sa &gt;&gt; Sing praises to God. Sing praises. Sing praises unto our king. Sing praises. God reignth over the heathen. God siteth upon the throne of his holiness. This one together. The princes of the people are gathered together. Even the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong unto God. He is greatly exalted. Amen. Brother Brian. Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Morning, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Is God your reference this morning? &gt;&gt; Have you turned everything over to him this morning? I was one of those quotes up there this morning. A couple of them. Um, you know, the one he would out of that message, desperation. And I was looking at that what brother Brandham said, you know, over 60 years ago, a Christian would be desperate if he sees the circumstances that he's living among. And I just have to raise my hand. You know, that was 60 years ago. Where are we this morning, the way the world is this morning? It should I have to examine myself if I do I have that desperation in my heart and life that I want to see God change my life, my family's life, everyone else's life. Um, if you would turn with me to the 12th chapter of of Romans, excuse me, I'll I I'm just going to read these uh I did something to myself this morning. I probably left what I meant to put in this Bible in the u in my office this morning, but I'll just read out of God's word this morning. And I wrote notes and I don't even have them here the way they should be this morning. Well, everything works for a purpose this morning. Um, I'll just read these couple of these verses out of the 12th chapter of Romans this morning. And, uh, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will. And I can remember the notes I wrote, but I was thinking about that uh about being transformed. And I was thinking about that simple word this morning. And the other word come to me and that's what's the problem of the world is this morning. The church can't reform you. There's nothing Paul's saying here in the word of God is saying there's you're either going to you can't be reformed. There's nothing in our nature that can be reformed. There's nothing in our nature that's good. There's not to say that there's certain aspects that we do every is it wrong? No. But there's nothing in us as individuals that's perfect. Nothing that can be reformed. And I think the the world we live in this morning, instead of bringing people to Christ, they're just reforming them. They're telling them if you do this or if you do that or if you don't do that, you'll be okay. But that's not the way it is supposed to be this morning. I'm honest. Uh everything that I thought I was going to say this morning is completely out of my heart and mind. So I'm just going along with what the way that God would lead me. And I I don't I don't have a lot to say, but I would say the most important thing. I was give God the glory this morning. You know, I've been coming up here for over 30 years, and I got to be honest with you this morning. There's a presence on me right now that u I'd rather be quiet and just speak what God would have me to say than to say something where I'm going down my own way. But uh as I was reading this scripture this morning, it really struck me and some of the quotes struck me this morning. Uh, and I wrote a true transformation of one's soul, there must be a real you have to have that real seed of life in your heart and spirit this morning. And I was thinking of examples, one or the other. Uh, we all we all have earthly natures that we're born with that if we don't let God change those natures, they they come out at the time when they're least when you least expect. And then you realize when that nature comes out that you got to put it below the blood of Jesus Christ so that it doesn't come out anymore. And we want to be real Christians this morning. We don't want to be what God doesn't want us to be this morning. And I I don't have a lot to say. I'm going to turn it over to brother Josh this morning. But I was thinking, which can be a dangerous thing sometimes, but if I say anything this morning, I know I've only been up here for three minutes, but I really feel checked in my spirit. The only thing I would say to us this morning, just with what the quotes were saying this morning that were up on the thing, it you can't it's not an age to be playing around with Jesus Christ this morning. And if I were to say anything, I noticed is that the day of playing around with church or playing around with, well, am I going to do it today or am I going to do it tomorrow? Those days are over with. You the world is the world keeps going on into oblivion this morning. And if we're not careful, we're going to go right along with it if we don't cling to the cross of Jesus Christ this morning. And I'll just finish with this simple thought. Everyone here this morning, you uh including myself, we have to be resurrected in Jesus Christ this morning. We have to be transformed by the cross of Jesus Christ. It's not reformation. You can't get a reformation. Just think of all the ages that have gone by. It's that won't work. That's what's wrong with the church world out there this morning. They they just they're going along to get along. That's not how it's a Christian supposed to be this morning. We want to be true Christians with a seat of life in our hearts. And the only way you get there, and I was just thinking, you know, the difference between a makebelieve Christian and a real Christian, like I was listening to a message this morning, a real Christian, you can tell them, of course, everyone wears pants or a dress. The difference between a real Christian, a good soldier and a bad soldier is you can it's not in how strong he is or how loud he is, but like brother I listen to that message. It's in simplicity and you all know what I'm going to say. It's you can tell by their knees how good of a soldier they are this morning. In anything that we think we're going to do, do we pray first or we just act first? That's the I'll just finish with that. I know I said that and I'm still talking. What most importantly, do you act first or do you pray first? And I I got to raise my hand as a man. I sometimes I just act first without giving God a chance to speak to my heart sometimes. And that's not how we're supposed to be as Christians. We should pray first, desire to seek God's will in our lives first before we do anything. And I'll just turn it over to brother Josh this morning. Amen. Let's stand this morning. Amen. It's good to see everybody here this morning. Make special welcome to our visitors from Virginia, Sister Mary, Sister Riley. Good to have you here with us this morning. Amen. Those tuning in on the stream and our shutins, good to have you here as well. Amen. Listening many things about tomorrow. I don't seem to understand. Oh, I don't know about tomorrow. I just live from day to day and I don't borrow from it sunshine for it skies may turn to gray. I don't worry reor the future for I know what Jesus said and today [Music] walk beside him for he knows what is ahead. Oh, many things about tomorrow I don't seem to understand. But I know who holds tomorrow. [Laughter] And I know who holds my hand. I don't know about tomorrow. It may bring me poverty. But the one who feeds the sparrow is the one who stands by me. And my path that is my portion may be through the flame or flood but his presence goes before me and I'm covered with his precious blood. Oh, many things about tomorrow [Music] I don't seem to understand. But I know who holds tomorrow. And I know who holds my hand. Amen. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty. [Music] Father in heaven, we love you and we lift your name in all the earth. May your kingdoms be established in our praises as your people declare your mighty works. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty [Music] who was and is and is to come. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who lives forever more and father of mercy be exalted. May Jesus name be lifted high for his sacrifice of love had won my pardon and his resurrection power gives me life. Oh, blessed be the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty [Music] who reigns forever more. Oh, blessed be the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come. Blessed be the Lord, God Almighty, who reigns forever more. Amen. Shout to the Lord. Amen. Let's start with the first verse this morning. My Jesus, my savior. Lord, there is none like you. All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love. Oh my comfort, my shelter, tower of reuge and strength. Let every breath and all that I am never cease to worship you. [Music] Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us sing. Power and majesty praise to the king. Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name. I sing for joy at the works of your hands. Forever I'll love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the promise I have in you. Oh my Jesus, my savior. Lord, there is none like you. All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love. My comfort, my shelter, tower of refugees stray. Let every breath and all that I am will never cease to worship you. Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us sing. Power and majesty praise to the King. Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name. Hey, I sing for joy at the works of your hands. Forever I'll love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the promise I have in you. Amen. You may be seated this morning. Before we go to prayer, let's sing Jehovah Gyra this morning. My provider, Jehovah Gyra, my proider. You are more than enough for me. [Music] Jehovah and you are my healer [Music] and by your stripes I've been set free. Jehovah Sham, [Music] you are with me and you supply all my needs. And you are more than enough. so much more than enough. You are more than enough for me. One more time. for Jehovah Gyra my provider. You are more than enough for me. Jehovah, you are my healer.

[Music] Amen. If you found it to be so this morning, amen, brother Danny, Brother Michael, John, and Brother Caleb, if you'd come this morning, take up the offering. Amen. We have a couple of prayer requests this morning. Brother David asked if we would remember Barb Strader this morning. She's in the early stages of Parkinson's. So, we want to pray for her this morning for a touch for the Lord. Also, please pray for Katie Alder. She was in a hayride accident and she has a broken back and hip and internal bleeding. Just want to remember her this morning. Also, sister Sarah is homesick this morning. Amen. Joe, would you pray for these needs this morning? [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Bless thee, oh Lord. With my hands lifted up, oh, and my mouth filled with praise.

I will bless thee, oh Lord, with a heart of thanksgiving. [Applause] I will bless thee, oh Lord. And I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. What have I done to deserve such glory revealed in me? [Music] Thanks for that special night when I saw your glorious light. Came face to face with eternal life. And Lord, I thank thee. Let's sing the chorus one more time. Oh, and I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. Oh, what have I done to deserve such glory revealed in me? And thanks for that special night when I saw your glorious life. Came face to face with eternal life. And Lord, I thank you. Amen. Let's stand down this morning and we're going to turn it over to brother Ber and we invited to come. Let's sing. I'm amazed that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed [Music] that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed at how you care. Through your preious blood, I found pardon. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. Bless you. You are amazed that you love me. Amaz. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I found found love and my sins are washed. All washed away. my sins are washed away. Amen. Let's bow our heads this morning, Lord Jesus. We want to thank you, Lord, for that wonderful song that we can sing from the bottom of our heart, Lord, knowing, Lord Jesus, that all of our sins are washed away, Father. and to see of your forgetfulness, Lord, by the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. That died for us on Calvary, Lord Jesus, purchased our salvation, Father, and made a way back for us to be able to come back and have fellowship with you once again, Lord. Father, we ask God once again that you would just take complete control of the service this morning. Have your way and say what you want to say, Father. Lord, get me out of the way, Lord Jesus, just so that you can have your way, Lord. And now, Lord, I pray God that you'll bless each one that has come here this morning, Lord. Father, has open hearts and open ears to hear what you would have to say to them this morning. We commit this service, Lord, to you now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. Good morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. Thank you, musicians. Appreciate the music this morning. Let's just turn our Bibles right away this morning. We'll just get into the word of God. Amen. We want to take an little thought off of something we mentioned. Amen. Briefly basically I think Wednesday. Amen. And so I want to just kind of continue on that or pull off of that thought if you will. So turn if you will to First Corinthians. We got a good signal. Okay. Good. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Sister Mary and Sister Riley. God bless y'all. Good to have you all this this morning. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. The rest of us pretty much home folks, I think. And so, we've got several out. Amen. So, Amen. That mean when there's a lot of people missing, you know what that means, don't you? Amen. We got to push the wagon. That means the ones that are here got to push a little harder. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. How many glad to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll tell you what, we we just we want to look at that this morning. And Amen. with the help of the Lord. All right, let's start, shall we? First Corinthians uh let me see here. 1 Corinthians 3. 1 Corinthians 3 and verse 20. Let's go back up just a little bit so we can get a little concept of what Paul was talking about. Verse 18. Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, he taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. Therefore, let no man glory in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come. All are yours and ye are Christ and Christ is God's. One more scripture. Turn to second Corinthians. 2 Corinthians 5. No, this is not correct. Second Corinthians 6 is what I got wrote down. 2 Corinthians 6. Yeah, that's right. 2 Corinthians 6. And brother Brandham used his scripture when he preached a message called possessing all things by the word of truth, by the power of God. Verse 7. Verse 6 and verse chapter 6 verse 7. By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report. As deceivers and yet true. As unknown and yet well-known. As dying and behold, we live. As chastened and not killed. as sorrowful yet always rejoicing. As poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated. Amen. Possessing all things. Amen. Uh I believe I titled it all things are yours. All things are yours. And this morning, as I think I mentioned Wednesday, I said that if we was really going to talk about everything that's yours, we could be here for a while. Amen. So, we're going to be here for a little bit this morning. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to look at. And I want to start with a quote that brother Brandon made. He says, "One of the greatest curses, this is in Jehovah Gyra 1955. One of the greatest curses on the full gospel church is not positionally knowing what they are in Christ." &gt;&gt; I've always said I meet two classes of people. One of them is the full gospel and the other is fundamental. the fundamentals knows where he's standing positionally. Only he's never been born again. Now notice this is a key phrase here. Never been born again. In other words, doesn't have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? But as far as the word, they've got it right. Fundamentally, they're right, but they don't have the spirit. Amen. So, we've actually got two problems that we want to try to solve this morning with the help of the Lord. Okay. They positionally know where he's standing, but he's never been born again. Just fundamental teaching alone. So, he doesn't have any faith. And the full gospel has been born again. All right. So, here's the born again person, but he doesn't know where he stands. It's just it's uh so it's just if I could ever get the full gospel Pentecostal faith and the fundamental believers or either the fundamental believers doctrine and the Pentecostal faith, we'd have it made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning I want to speak a little bit with the help of the Lord because you know we seem to be able to have faith for salvation. &gt;&gt; But how many knows that it goes so much deeper than that? &gt;&gt; There is so much more for us to possess much for us to have you know and sometimes we really battle we really battle with having faith for diabetes. We have battle for having faith for blood pressure. Amen. A gout on our feet or whatever it might be. We, you know, it's a struggle. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So, I hope this morning will help us. Amen. Try to try to get a try to get the right channel, so to speak. Amen. And really be able to get somewhere because, you know, there's so many promises there and we just we don't want to live underprivileged. &gt;&gt; I think we're living in the age. How many believe we're living in the age? I truly believe that it is time that we get to the place that we're supposed to. We got to be getting close to the place that we're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; And I begin to write down of how that uh you know my let me let me let me uh let me let me go back. Let me finish this thought. Is that okay? All right. We'll try to pick that up with the help of the Lord. So that's why we have it made. See, it's like a man that can write a check, but he hasn't got any money in the bank. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He can write a check, but he don't have no money in the bank. He says, and the other one, he can't write the check, but he's got money in the bank. Amen. The man that can't write a check has money, but he don't know how to write the check. That's the way it is. What's he going to do? One's got money in the bank, one can't write a check. The other one can write a check and ain't got no money in the What are you going to do? You got to get those two together. &gt;&gt; What good do all these promises of God do to us? If we don't get possession of it, &gt;&gt; if we don't know how to write a check, how many believes that we've been given a checkbook? How many knows that? &gt;&gt; Sure we have. We've all been given a checkbook. Anybody that's ever born again has been given a checkbook. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. I want to just Amen. Can I just read it? Brother Bam says, "The trouble with Christians today is they don't realize what is provided for them. God's provided healing." Many people doesn't realize that the great glories and powers that's provided for them. Amen. He says when you become a Christian, walk around find out what you own. Find out what's yours. See, all things are yours given to you freely. Everything that Christ died for is yours. Whatever. Amen. Listen. Every one of you. Every one of you. And you've got a checkbook with Jesus' name signed across there and saying, "Whatever you send this check to the father. Whatever you ask my father's name, I will do it." &gt;&gt; You're just scared to fill it out. Amen. How many know that little doubt that comes in our mind? That's our battle. Amen. That's where the devil, that's where you have to fight for it. You've got to overcome that little doubt that comes in your mind. Amen. Overcome that little doubt that comes in your mind. You got to fight for every inch of it if you're going to get it. Praise the Lord. Now, let me just write quick just in case somebody would be online and what are you talking about a checkbook and and so forth with Jesus name signed on the bottom. Here it is. This is the checkbook. Amen. In St. John 14:13 says, "And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do." &gt;&gt; That the father may be glorified in the son, ask anything in my name, and I will do it. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; How many believe that's where you and I stand? That's our promise. Not just a quote, but goes right back to the Bible. Shows you where you have the right to do so. &gt;&gt; If you abide in me and my words abide in you, St. John 15, I believe it is. I'm the vine and you are the branches. Amen. Ask anything in my name and I'll do it. And Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's good. That is good. People don't realize what's provided. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then to write the next quote after he says what you sent that check to the father don't be afraid. If we have uh he says we have no need or lack of anything. No need or lack or of anything. Wow. When I thought about that scripture I thought with that quote I thought about Ephesians 1 and verse three. Paul said, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; How many believes he said he has raised us up together and has made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. How many is glad for that? &gt;&gt; That's right. He's provided us everything. We don't have lack of anything. God has provided everything that we have need of in this journey. I'm going to try to do a little teaching this morning. So, y'all just settle down. It's provided us right here. And although every man that is born of the spirit of God, the Lord gives him a checkbook. Amen. How many believes that's what we want to look at? We want to look at what what we have because sometimes you might not think you have very much. That's why I read where Paul says, "Man, we might be poor. We're maybe as sorrowful and you know, and we might be as poor but yet making many rich." But he said he said this way. Today the true believer is cast out from among the people called a fanatic, a holy roller or some kind of insulting name, some kind of a religious fa fanatic. And yet he is heir to the whole heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth. Oh my. You talk about push you out in the cabin somewhere and hardly enough money to pay your rent. Yet you own it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just thought when I was studying here it says you might think you're as poor. What are you talking about? I'm rich. What are you talking about? I own everything. I don't feel like I don't own anything, man. I got hard. I I'm terribly poor. What you need to do if you got the Holy Ghost is look a little deeper. &gt;&gt; How many believe you got to look a little deeper, &gt;&gt; man? Quit looking out there and start looking in here. &gt;&gt; That's what we're going to do this morning. We're going to inspect what's down on the inside of this chest here. &gt;&gt; On each one, we're going to inspect, find out what's down in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. down in that little heart and in that little compartment there where there's no blood cells or nothing. What they call the place of the soul. Let's see what in it's inhabited in there. How many believes that that's got to be inhabited? &gt;&gt; There's Man, don't get me going. There's something there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Makes me holler a little. That's right. It makes me feel good. It satisfies me. It quenches my thirst. &gt;&gt; It does all these things. makes me shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'll take all of eternity for us to praise him for what he is &gt;&gt; and for what he means to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll just go ahead. I was studying down through there. Brother Brand processing all things and he talks about all these things and at the end he says, "And are we worthy of it?" No, we're not worthy of it. Amen. But yet, if there was a man that was a a drunkard or whatever he might be and if his father left him a million dollars, it don't mean it matter if he's a drunkard or whatever he is, he has an inheritance. That's his inheritance. And he says the way we are, we weren't worthy. God come down and cleaned us up. We weren't worthy of anything that God did. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all praise. It's not because of your worthiness. It's because that you are a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; I've got so much to be thankful for. Amen. So much to praise him for. Amen. All right, let's go on here. You might have to work and toil and everything else. You might think that you are poor, but he says, "But yet you're heir of everything that's here. The meek shall inherit the earth. They possess it. Oh my, I like that. Possessor of earth. The believer. Now, here's just one thing we want to touch on that the believer has. Amen. Because I wrote down here, we sometimes don't know what we got. I like to go over. Let's see what we got here. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got an abstract. Brother Bam says, "The believer has a title, an abstract deed." That's right. By Jesus Christ, he shall be possessor of this entire universe. That's right. The meek shall inherit the earth. You say, "Well, brother Brandon, I need healing." The promise is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that? That's what you possess on the inside of your heart. You possess healing. You possess salvation. You possess the Holy Ghost. If you possess the Holy Ghost, then you possess these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You need healing. Oh, it ain't going to get easy. It ain't You ain't going to get it easy. He says, I'm going to tell you that. You're going to have to take it away from Satan. &gt;&gt; How many believes that the greatest battle that we have is in our mind? That's where our battle is. It's that doubt. Well, somebody else tried it and didn't make it. Why are you looking at that? I don't care how many tried it and didn't make it. That ain't got nothing to do with it. Amen. If Satan captures your health, you've got a right to go to Satan, says, "Give it back. Hand it over. I come in the name of the Lord." Why? The possessor of heavens and earth. Now remember, brother Brandon mentioned in the Bible talks about how that when Abraham met uh Melchzdc, possessor of heavens and earth. Now the reason that we can say that we're possessors of heaven and earth because we're joint hes with him. How many believes when you're a child of God, you are a joint heir with Christ? I wonder, brother Woody, what will happen if we ever get all these things in our mind the way they're supposed to get it in our mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. This world would just not mean so much anymore. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I believe everybody sitting in here, every real true Christian doesn't have his eyes on this world and on the things of this world. Our eyes is on that home. The goal is that home of the soul. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? That's right. We're all living for that great day that lays ahead. &gt;&gt; Here we are going 2025. But I'm here to tell you, how many's believing that not too long from now, we're going to be in another place. &gt;&gt; We're going to be somewhere else, folks. We're not going to stay here. And we need to keep that in our mind, &gt;&gt; realizing we're not going to be here forever. We're going to meet the Lord Jesus in the air. Amen. St. John 3, I believe it first John 3 talks about, behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us. When he when he appears, we're going to be like him. We're going to have a body like unto his own glorious body. And he that hath this hope in himself purifith himself even as he is pure. &gt;&gt; I mean that'll that's what helps you to live a holy life, live a righteous life because you're getting ready to meet him. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. All right. Give it back. Come in the name of the Lord. That's right. See, I'm his heir. Give it back. You took my child, got him mixed up with the wrong boy, perhaps or whatever it might be. You took my boy and mixed him up with the wrong girl. I claimed him. That's right. I claimed my children. I claimed my brother. I claimed my sister. &gt;&gt; How many believe you can do that? You got family members that are not gone wayward. You get on your knees and you claim them. Say, "God, I claim him." In the name of the Lord, it's your right. Amen. Praise the Lord. I claimed him. But how do you know? He says, I because I'm an heir of all things and it's given me. Amen. And I can claim everything that God promised me. There you are. Then he even goes on to talking about I'm even an heir to a throne. To him that overcomemeth will I sit will sit with me in my throne even as I have overcame and sit down my father in his throne. How many feels humbled to know that by God's grace you're going to sit with him in his throne over on the other side? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you can be like that black slave. Amen. That walked around with his head up. Amen. And and was and worked hard and so forth because they they couldn't understand why he did that way and the way he conducted himself that way. It's because back home he they found out he was a child of a king. &gt;&gt; How many believe that's the way we want to conduct ourselves? Lord, help us to conduct ourselves as children of the king. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So, the reason for this message this morning, the reason that we want to look at how that we seem to be able to believe for our salvation, but then there's other things perhaps that we have trouble with. I got wrote down here, we have to ask ourselves because the one desire that we have is to be closer to God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And before you can get closer to God, you got have that thirst to be closer to God. Ask yourself, are you closer to God than what you was last year? &gt;&gt; I believe we need to check ourselves, search ourselves, &gt;&gt; see if you're closer last year, but I don't believe it's just last year, but I believe we need to take it to last month. How about last month? Are you closer to God this this month than you was last month? &gt;&gt; How about this week? How about this Sunday? Are you closer to God this morning than what you was last Sunday? &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz how many believes that when you become a child of God, when you become a son of God, Amen. God gives you the best thing that he could give you. Amen. And he called it the best tutor there is. How many believe you each and every one of us and that tutor means teacher ain't that right? That tutor is the Holy Ghost that he been given you. Amen. He goes back to the father don't understand it all but he brings a report to him. Amen. And that tutor teaches us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I was to ask you what did the Holy Spirit teach you last week? He did me something. Amen. The last few days the Holy Spirit has really taught me something. Yeah, me too. &gt;&gt; And I thank the Lord for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But how many believes knows that every circumstance that comes you away? You need to keep your eyes open. &gt;&gt; You need to be aware that the circumstances that God allows you to get into are for a reason. They are for molding you. They are for shaping you. It's for getting you ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as Israel, hello. I believe this where I want to go now for a minute or two. that tutor. Amen. That God gives a real believer. That's what we have. Amen. In our hearts. Now, he has given us also teachers, amen, a pastor. The Bible says he's apt to teach or a pastor that teaches or evangelist or Amen. or missionary or apostles and prophets. First, he give us what? Prophets. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Well, Israel, look at them. They had a prophet Moses, right? And they believed to Moses. They followed him out of Egypt. But how many believe just believing in a prophet? Well, that's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's right. Cuz they got out there and what did God do? He took them down to the Red Sea to try to teach them. &gt;&gt; He was trying to train them. He was trying to teach them. Teach them what? Not to rely upon themselves. &gt;&gt; He was trying to test their faith to see if they would believe God when they come to dead ends in their life. How many believe we get the dead ends, the doctors can't do anything, nobody can do anything and it looks bleak. It looks terrible. And then we how you react in those times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you if you haven't been there a time or two, you're fixing to. &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God, that God is going to take you to those places. Brother Brandham said that he takes every son that he receives to that place, that place of chastisement. Amen. Even his brother came, brother Brandham came to those places different times in his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what it is, it's just one after the other. And then after the Red Sea, they didn't pass that test. They complained and murmured and said, "Didn't you bring us out, you know, out here?" There was a couple of them. Hallelujah. How many glad for the Joshua and the Calebs? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God does in your life. That's what he does in my life. He'll allow situations to rise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll allow the preacher to make you mad. &gt;&gt; Maybe say something you really don't like. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just to see how you react. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just be ready to see how you are. I don't know about you, but I want to be what God wants me to be. &gt;&gt; I want to be mature. I want to be ready to leave this place. &gt;&gt; Cuz we know that Luther and Wesley and Pentecost, God was all progressive. That was the maturing. I want to say the maturing of the word, but the mature, the word never does mature. Why? It's always the same. It's the people that have to come back to the maturity of the word. We are the ones that have to mature. The word doesn't have to get any better. It's good as it is. &gt;&gt; But we had to mature in Pentecost. Oh, they got to have a big old gifts and everything. And Luther, all he knew was just shall live by faith and all these other things. But you know, progress, progress, progress. How many believed in our age with this message of this hour, we've had an example of a son of God &gt;&gt; that came to adoption? I know those are big words, but I believe Brother Brandham came to adoption. I believe God could trust him with the spoken word. Now say what you want to them. &gt;&gt; Speak to that storm. Speak to that couple. He could give him the power to spoken word. I wonder this morning how far along we are. &gt;&gt; Are we come to that place where God can do trust us with that? We still got a little hang-ups about this and a little hang-ups about that. Amen. We can't be in second and third grade. We've got to be up here and Amen. get our degree. Isn't that right? Our college degree. What is that? Learn your ABCs. &gt;&gt; A college degree is to learn your ABCs. &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; Always. Not sometimes, not once in a while. Oh, I passed it that time, but not this time. No. Always believe Christ. No matter what your situation is, believe Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Bam says a few years ago, he says they didn't know what electricity was. I thought, man, look at all the things that we didn't know that existed a few years ago naturally speaking. And how about spiritually? How many's glad to have lights? I don't know about you, but I'm glad to have air conditioning. I'm glad that we can warm this place and how they figured out how to warm this place. &gt;&gt; But I'm a whole lot more glad for the word that he brought that teaches who you are, what you are, where you come from, where you're going, how to live. &gt;&gt; How to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to ain't got to drive a horse and buggy you to think that I'm going to make it to heaven. Listen to a bunch of false preachers that uh you know don't even believe the word of God or the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad for that &gt;&gt; progression? Praise the Lord. Think about it now. He says, "But Thomas Edison and and you know, listen to this Benjamin Franklin Thomas Edison for a minute. But he had a hunger in his heart to find out what he was." How many knows Thomas did? He had a hunger in his heart. Let me find out what this electricity will do. Let me find out what it's going to do. Let me find out what it's going to do. But Abraham talks about that boy on the bicycle pedal on deep calling to the deep. He says before there's a deep darer, Amen, there's got to be a thirsting for that deep. Before a deep can respond, there's got to be a hunger for a deep. Amen. This morning, evening like tabernacle, there's got to be a hunger for you to go further with God, deeper in God. If there's ever going to be more of God for you to have, &gt;&gt; we can't sit there just happy where we are. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, if you haven't progressed, if you haven't changed, then there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; I like what brother Bam said about that. I guess she was colored, but this woman told him, he says, you know, I'm not what I want to be. &gt;&gt; I'm not what I want to be. I'm not what I ought to be, &gt;&gt; man. Y'all some holy angels around here &gt;&gt; after church. I want to meet with you that didn't raise your hand and ask tell you how did you do it cuz I want to find the wire that you got. No, I know y'all. I'm just pulling your leg. Amen. But listen, you can't stay in that same place that you've been. There has to be a growth. There's got to be something pulling God. There's, you know, if he if God could take our prophet to that place, why can't we go there? &gt;&gt; Do you realize, Brother John said Debbie, you realize, Brother Bam said, when that third pool comes in and that when that right time comes, you watch that third pool, Ben. &gt;&gt; I mean, that was not in Brother Bam's time. That was talking about down the road somewhere. &gt;&gt; How many believe we're we're we're we're exercising. God is working on us &gt;&gt; to have faith in him &gt;&gt; to have faith in him. Amen. We're fixing to get to something here. Amen. So, you know, he says when Franklin caught that lightning, he didn't know what he had. Lord, help us. Lord, help us this morning. If I can do anything is just to help us a little bit more to realize what you got, &gt;&gt; what you have. And where is it at? External material thing. No, it's right here. &gt;&gt; It's right here. Right in your heart. I know it's a trick question if I ask you, what do you got? Because the answer would be, I've got everything that I need &gt;&gt; in this world or in the world to come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, know that's the answer. I've got everything that I have need of right here. Brother Bram said, he said, uh, when we get those two together is what we need to do. And then he says, and if we if we could ever get the scare out of the people, he said, that's something. Oh, I don't know. You're wanting a little touch me or a hocus pocus. If I could get this preacher to pray for me. If I could get that preacher to pray for me. Yeah. Remember the one brother that came to Brother Bam says, "I went to or Roberts. I went to Billy Graham and now I've come to you." He says, "Well, you ain't going to get no help here either &gt;&gt; cuz I can't help you. Your faith has to be in the right place. &gt;&gt; You're putting your confidence in the man. You ain't going to get nothing. Conf. You've got to trust the Lord. Amen. Then he got somewhere. People that want to have some kind of something like that. Listen to what Brother Bam says. He says, "God's word is your basis. God said so. That settles it." &gt;&gt; I mean, that's all you need. You don't know chills up your back. You don't need somebody to tell you that. need to know God's already told you. What you need is faith. &gt;&gt; To believe what God said. &gt;&gt; How many believe that's what really that's what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; That's the basis. Just laid it out there. Perfect. That's where we believe it. See? Amen. Oh, if I could just do this or if I could just do that. It's not what you done, it's what God has done for you. &gt;&gt; People say, "Oh, if I can just keep holding on, it ain't you holding on. It's whether he held on or not. It ain't what I am. It's what he is." &gt;&gt; Woo. That ought to make us happy. That gives us joy because it's not about you at all. It's just simply about believing what he done. Oh, if I could live holy enough. Oh, the devil points you to your faults. Every time you want to believe something, he'll point you to your fault. Make you believe. Oh, well, I felt No, quit thinking that. &gt;&gt; It's already under the blood. Realize that the thoughts that come in your mind are either of God or they're of the devil. &gt;&gt; My praise the Lord. Amen. Get the scare out of people. Get the fear out of people. Amen. I'm going to go ahead and stop here, but I wanted to go into some of these other things, but talking about the fruit of the spirit, how that the fruit of the spirit is the life of God. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. The fruit that comes from that spirit is the essence of God. Amen. And one of those things is love. Is that right? Now fear or scares the people. Fear has no virtue at all. Does it? The Bible says he that fearth is not made perfect in love. Cuz perfect love casts out fear. &gt;&gt; How many believe we're not supposed to be scared of anything? Why are you not scared of anything? Because if it's the perfect love of God in your heart, because it's the perfect Holy Ghost in your heart, God ain't scared of anything. There's nothing that scares God. It didn't scare Paul. It didn't scare FF Borth. It didn't scare Paul Raider. &gt;&gt; Hello. Not even death. Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. See, listen. Then God takes the faith of Abraham and places it in the believer by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, how many knows what the faith of Abraham is? The faith of Abraham ain't the faith of Abraham. [Laughter] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's the faith that Abraham got from God and that he had in God. That's the faith that God recognized, his own faith, a revelation. But he made them the father of their faith because he was the first one. Ain't that right? One that he called out. He believed God and he counted things that were not as though they were. &gt;&gt; I hope that we've all learned that whenever you have a something come up or whatever, not to say negative things about it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got this and I got that. Woo! You just signed off. You might say, "The devil's trying to put this on me. The devil's trying to put that on me, but I rebuke him in the name of Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. I've had something in my foot the last three months. Been hurting, hurting, hurting, hurting. Caleb says it's gout. You know, I've been eating too much meat. I guess too much of that hamburger, that good beef we slaughtered. I don't know what it is, but I've been believing and believing and believing and saying, "God, I believe that by your stripes I'm healed." &gt;&gt; Amen. I woke up this morning. &gt;&gt; I don't feel a thing. &gt;&gt; I feel good. Amen. Just hold on. Claim the word. Says, confess it, and go on. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care how much I can jump on one foot. It don't hurt. It's just feeling good this morning. &gt;&gt; I don't care what how many believes whatever it is. &gt;&gt; Whatever your ailment is. &gt;&gt; Believe God. He is your healer. You ain't got to come up here and be prayed for. &gt;&gt; I'll gladly lay my hands on if that'll help your faith. Ain't that right? There's nothing wrong with that. They shall lay hands on the sick, but they shall recover. But brother Bannon had him come up there and says, "Now have faith." Oh, I got perfect faith. Well, then what you doing up here? &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then what are you doing up here? If you got perfect faith, you should have got it right there and you're saved. You should accept it when you heard the word of God. &gt;&gt; But your faith is weak perhaps and you need a little boost. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it works both ways. Why? Because he did say they'll lay hands on the sick and they'll recover. That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; But if you have higher faith, Amen. You don't have to leave your seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are y'all ready for some good stuff? &gt;&gt; All right. Here we go. Thank you, son. Now, notice. So, he placed it in every believer by the Holy Ghost. You get it? Then you begin to believe all things. Hope all things. How many believes that? That's right. And that's when the gospel really goes to work in the heart. It's not no nothing, no great. I think people make it too complicated by giving some great big lectures, big long words. What does that do for the common class of people about them great big words? What would I know about them? Nothing. No sir, I just like to see it just really in its simplicity. Yet, it's the most powerful thing that the world has ever known. How many believes is the gospel of Jesus Christ accepted on the basis of the shed blood of Jesus Christ? Come and believe him. The whole thing, that whole thing is right there. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. And I ain't never went back and forth so much in my notes before, but we're trying to do a good job as best we can. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just the simplicity of it. Listen to what brother Bram says here. He says, "Here is a house and the worshipper, what was the requirements? Lay a lamb and so forth. Take the blood and take hissup and apply it on the post and the linel of the door." And by the way, that hissup was just common weeds. Hisup means your faith. &gt;&gt; Somebody tries to have supernatural faith. That's the reason you miss your healing. Just he said faith is just a common thing. You got faith to come to church. &gt;&gt; You had faith to come to church. You got faith to walk out there. You got faith to start your car. I don't know about you, but when I get in my truck and I stick that key in and I turn it, I I don't say, "Oh, man. And I don't I don't know if it's going to do it or not. Oh, I I don't dare turn it. I just don't know for sure if it's going to work. How many does that? &gt;&gt; Well, can you imagine it probably not work because of your lack of faith? Who knows, you know? But no, you go over there and you just start it. And that's what brother Bam said. Just the God's word said it. I believe it. That settles it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we try to have something supernatural. Well, you know, brother Bam say it's just regular common ism. You got faith to eat your dinner. That's the way it is. Just common faith. Apply the blood was applied with hip, which is a common weeds that grows anywhere in Palestine. Amen. Oh my. Now, there's a quote I'm looking for. Just give me a second here. Let's go back and uh let's go back to Thomas Edison. and so forth. Now, Franklin didn't know what he had. All right? He said, "I got it. I got it." He knew there had been a resurrection. He knew there was something there, but he didn't know what it was. Now, notice, he says, "Friend, one day, say for instance, the electric lights. There was time when man would thought, boy, if they told somebody 500 years ago that they'd have electric like that, that person would have said, "That person's crazy." But there was a man one time down in his heart believed that there would. Amen. And talking about Benjamin from Franklin first he had that kite and so forth, you know, and he says he screamed, "I got it. I got it." But he didn't know what he had. He says, "That's what's the church. The matter with the church today, they got something, but they don't know what they got." Amen. And now, as long as he had it, he could rejoice. Amen. He could feel it. Benjamin Franklin could feel it. But he didn't do nothing with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought that was a good lesson. What good is it if we never do anything with it? &gt;&gt; How many know the Bible tells us that we ought to ask for great things? Brother Abraham says, "Ask for big things." &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you this right now. I mean, to ask God to conform you into the very image of his son to get you ready for the rapture. That's a big request. Can I warn you? If you really mean that in your heart and raise your hand, that's my request. &gt;&gt; Be ready next week. &gt;&gt; God answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Be ready next week. I a couple weeks ago, I prayed a certain prayer. Amen. And certain things happened to me here in the last few days that I just knew that was the answer. God was answering my request. God will answer your prayer. It may not be h may not be convenient for you. It may not be. You may not enjoy it, so to speak. I thought it's pretty crazy, Wy, isn't it? To have trials and tribulation and enjoy it. What in the world? I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy that. But yet Paul says, you know, the my trials and my tribulation. I take pleasure in my infirmities. If I'm going to brag about something, I'm going to tell you, Amen. How I got shipwrecked, how they stoned me, and how they beat me after death. For when I am weak, then is he strong. Anybody believes that? And that's the joy of it. Not the suffering. That's not the joy of it. But the joy of it is to know that God is your deliverer. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; He is your healer. &gt;&gt; He is the one that takes you through. &gt;&gt; The Israelites, they didn't have no, they weren't over on this side of the Red Sea rejoicing. No, they were sorrowful. They were sitting around their camps with the wy wy woo blues. They were complaining. Oh man, we're going to get it now. This that or the other. But it wasn't until the sea opened. God, come on to say &gt;&gt; when they got to the other side, Miriam and all the sisters, they got the tambourine and began to dance up and down the floor. Amen. Harder the battle, the sweeter the victory. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; That's right. Let this age try to choke out your Holy Ghost. Try to drown you out. Try to make you lo lukewarm. Guess what? You press through that and say, "I refuse to be lukewarm, mediocre about church or anything else. I don't care if it's just a half a crowd. I don't care if there ain't no amen. I'm going to praise you, God. I'm going to be hot for God." Hallelujah. The harder the battle, the sweeter the victory. Amen. All right. I still haven't found the quote that I'm looking for. Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good, isn't he? I don't guess I got another one. I guess that's it. Amen. All right. That's what's the matter with the church. They got something, but they don't know it. He didn't know it. He didn't do anything with it. But when Thomas Edison come along, what did he do? He searched diligently for tireless hours. Ain't that right? Amen. To try to find out what he could do. Amen. And didn't the Bible say that if you seek God diligently without faith, it is impossible to please God. For they that come to him must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Lord Jesus, how many times we get in our prayer closet and say, "Lord, I'm seeking your face." Go sometime and look, go in your and do a search quote quote search on on seeking God's face. Amen. But they that seek him diligently shall find him. Amen. Praise the Lord. shall find him. That's how we That's how I feel. You know what I'm looking for? You know what I'm looking for? Oh, I've been like Terry Titwell sang. I've been listening for a different sound. Is that right? I'm looking for a body change. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for a place to cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. looking where the rapture is going to take place. Not looking to die. Anybody looking to die? No. I hope we're all looking to go in the rapture this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if there's a deep calling, if there's a thirst there, there has to be a amen to quench that thirst. Brother Bam says a very simple basic theology or or thought so to speak. Before there was uh a fin on a fish's back, there had to be water for him to swim in. Swim in. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm longing and thirsting for more of God. How many is with me? I'm thirsting for more of God. &gt;&gt; More of you. More of you. I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. &gt;&gt; Let's look at a couple more things. I'm just going to I'm just going to uh uh paraphrase what I heard. He says, you know, he said, he said, there's enough God in here right now. He said, to heal everybody. &gt;&gt; There's enough God in here, you know, just like electricity. They just had to find a way to channel it. &gt;&gt; All he had to do is find a way to channel that power. How many believe that's what you and I got to do is we got to find that way. Amen. To channel the power. I know I've got that thing somewhere, but I don't. Let me look a little harder. All right. Nope. I just don't see it. The channel that power and he makes a statement. He makes the quotation that love and faith is the wire. He talked about that channel that it takes love and faith. How many knows that love is the most powerful force there is? Amen. &gt;&gt; Me and my wife, we on the way to church, we were thinking about how the love of God, how rich and how deep it really is. How how how much God really loved the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. How much God loves you. Amen. And whenever you possess that Holy Ghost, what's on the inside? How many believes that you possess the love of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you will to Galatians. We'll go into a little bit different direction, but we do want to look at what is ours. Amen. And what we possess, what we really have. What do we really have? If you've got God's spirit, then chapter 5 of Galatians, verse 22, begins like this. But the fruit of the spirit is love. Amen. How many believes that's the first thing that Paul says is love. First John 3 says, "If any man love not his brother, then he is not of God." If anybody say that he loves God and hates his brother, he is a liar. For God is love. I mean, God is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to stop there before I read the rest of it and we're going to go to 1 Corinthians 13. Paul said, "Though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity or love, I'm become a sounding brass or a tingling symbol." Amen. Wednesday, we was talking about how we enjoy things. Isn't that right? We enjoy it. It's a pleasure. Be the real joy of God is a pleasure to us. We enjoy having the joy of the Lord. Because that joy itself, it's not just some happiness that by passes by, but but it's deep. But since then, I thought, you know, the real thing, the other real thing that we have is not just joy, not just the peace that God gives, but we've got the very love of God. What makes us come to church? What makes us do the right thing is the love that you have for God. &gt;&gt; The love is that driving force. I mean, believes it. It's the driving force. Love is though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains have not charity I am nothing. Amen. Um I believe one scripture says something about the love of God that is shed abroad in our hearts. What's in you? What's in that chest of yours? What's in that heart of yours? I'll tell you what's in your heart. Paul said it this way in Colossians. It that it's the mystery that's been hid from ages and generation. Whereof I am made a minister. Colossians 1:25. according to the dispensation of God which is given to me to you word to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you. Amen. The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; How many believe brother preached Christ is the mystery? He talks about God in you. It's the mystery of the whole thing is that God will take &gt;&gt; people like you, &gt;&gt; people like me, common people, nobodies, downcast, prophet followers, during a cult, all kinds of stuff like that. And yet God veils himself and hides himself in your heart. How many believes that's what it's really all about? &gt;&gt; That's really, you know, Amen. &gt;&gt; People ask, "Well, when Jesus prayed to the father, they said there had to be another one somewhere. The father had to be up there." But you know what brother Bam said? He says when Jesus prayed, he prayed to the spirit that was on the inside of him. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we reach out there. Folks, when you pray, talk to him right here. He's not that far away. It's Christ in you. The greatest thing that we possess is that Holy Spirit on the inside of our hearts. Don't you agree &gt;&gt; that no matter where you go, you always got that love. You always got that joy. Because that joy is the second thing I believe he pushed. He said, &gt;&gt; the very essence of God, let's comprehend it now. The very faith of God. But the fruit of the spirit is love. It's joy. It's peace. So when God was by himself, wasn't even a angel, wasn't no star, was nothing. He was by himself. How many believes that in him was this love? &gt;&gt; He was this joy. &gt;&gt; He was this peace. He was this longsuffering. He was gentleness. He was goodness. He was faith. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it be known to people listening out there, to everybody here, that if you have genuine faith that you possess in your heart, the very faith that when God said, "Let there be." And there was. &gt;&gt; That's not off there in Genesis anymore. That's in your heart now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ben, one place he says, you know, get God in your heart one time and it's not so hard to believe him. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, if you get God in your heart, it's impossible for you to say, "Well, this word isn't inspired or we don't believe that." &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost can't say that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost wrote the word. The Holy Ghost is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll punctuate every word of God with a amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost will do. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe you ought to have plenty of amens in the church? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. So, the very essence of joy, longsuffering. Amen. Oh my. My my my my. Aren't you glad to have that love, &gt;&gt; that joy, that peace? Like I said, when he was by himself, he had peace in his heart. He was peace. &gt;&gt; Now you get to enjoy that peace. &gt;&gt; My peace I give you. Not as the world giveth give I unto you. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? But how many really enjoys his peace? &gt;&gt; The same way with joy. He says he said that your joy might be full. Then longsuffering. Some of these things longsuffering. You want to be short with a family member. You want to be short with your workers or you want to be short with somebody just get away from the Holy Ghost a little bit. You'll become irritable, snappy. &gt;&gt; Short. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Very short. &gt;&gt; Short fused. But God has a long fuse. &gt;&gt; God is longsuffering. When brother Brandham was preaching on this, the statue of a perfect man, he says longsuffering. I believe he's either under longsuffering or patience. But I think it was longsuffering. He says, you know, he's been preaching at the tabernacle for 30 years and people still cut their hair, people still do this. He says, we're longsuffering. God, the Holy Spirit is longsuffering. Amen. Amen. Amen. I'm going to once again jump around a little bit. But I got wrote down here. Look at where you come from. Amen. And imagine where you will be. And look at yourself of where you are. Look at where you've come from. Amen. How many's thankful to be able to say, "I'm not what I used to be." &gt;&gt; I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just that's the one thing she would I guess I left that off last time, didn't I? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm not what I used to be. And I thank God because used to be everything, every little thing people would do irritated me, &gt;&gt; got me upset, caused me to lose sleep at night. Amen. things that people did. Perhaps people have bitterness, might have bitterness for a while, but you know, as a mature Christian, you can say, "I don't have bitterness anymore." &gt;&gt; I realize people's going to make mistakes. I realize brother B is going to say things that I don't like sometimes. I realize you're going to say things I don't like sometimes. But I know the good thing about it is I know your heart. How many believe we all know each other's heart here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's important. And I'm very thankful that we love one another. How many believes that? I'm thankful this morning that this church is not what it used to be. &gt;&gt; I don't have to come up here and just preach correction. Now y'all quit your gossiping. Amen. Quit sewing divisions. Quit being discontent. &gt;&gt; We're not so discontent anymore. Nothing makes us happy and all of that. &gt;&gt; That's right. How many believe we've we've changed? &gt;&gt; Us as individuals, we've grown up. &gt;&gt; It's time to come to maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And not be like Israel was every time that God tested him, tried them with hunger, with thirst. Ain't that right, boy? You want to get somebody? Well, I started paying my tithes. And I'm here to tell you, I ain't never been so broke. I can't barely do this. Huh? God's testing you. See if you really believe it or not. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll eat peanut butter and jelly then this week. I'm going to do what God said do. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Then you watch. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says if you want to prove God on anything, prove him on that. I guarantee you he'll up to open up the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing or his word ain't right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "You prove him on it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. How many believes it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a bunch of tattletales anymore. Not a bunch of gossipers anymore. Now, don't have that friction. I trust there's no friction. Live peaceibly among all men as much as lith in you. How many believes that's the way we ought to do? &gt;&gt; Boy, I'll tell you, I I don't know why I'm saying this, but I'm going to say it. Comes to mind. He says, you know, if you really want to grieve the Holy Spirit, get a bunch of gossip going on in the church. Get a bunch of discontent and the Holy Ghost will take its flight. &gt;&gt; We've seen it. Is that right? Just take it's gone. &gt;&gt; It won't do any of that. It's meek. It's gentle. It's easy to be entreated. It's patient. It's long-suffering. &gt;&gt; It's gentle. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Help all of us men to be a little more gentle, more sensitive. Ain't that right? Goodness, faith, and meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. And they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. And if we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. Amen. Praise the Lord. In closing, let's look at just a couple things. How many believes that this is all things? All things are yours. All of this is yours. If you don't have gentleness like you should, watch out. Ask God for it. &gt;&gt; He'll bring it about to where you have more gentleness, you have more meekness, you more have more patience, &gt;&gt; you have more longsuffering. It's all the life of God. and faith to believe that whatever you have need of you can ask and it shall be given to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many's thankful for the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; in your own personal life? Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, that you would come down an unworthy person &gt;&gt; like myself, like all of us. Unworthy. We didn't deserve it. &gt;&gt; You know how many people out there are miserable? &gt;&gt; They don't possess what you possess. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is God himself. I may look at you, Brother Josh. I may look at Brother John, Sister Alicia. I may look at all of you and I see your faces. But I'm here to tell you, down on the inside of that, there's deity. &gt;&gt; There's God himself. And I think every one of us needs to be sensitive to that on a daily basis and say, "Lord, help me to be sensitive to that. Let me be led by that." If I would say anything in closing is let the Holy Spirit teach you. Amen. How many believes that the Holy Spirit wants to teach us? He wants to make us bring us to that place to where we can have more love, have more faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. To where it's the channel. It's the avenue because ultimately ultimately love brings faith. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Love brings faith. It causes you to have faith. &gt;&gt; And so love is the first thing. And love God with all of your heart, mind, soul, and strength. God bless you. Let's stand this morning. That's my heart's desire for a closer walk with the Lord &gt;&gt; and that he would have complete control of my life. Amen. Do you hear that? Complete. How many is with me? Complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether no matter where I am, no matter what I'm doing, let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, this morning, our hearts are bowed to you, Lord. We're hungering and thirsting to see you in the air. This world, Father, as we see our nation divided, can't even be happy with the majority of the people that voted in and man, but have to go out and protest. Unhappy, unsatisfied. We feel for them. They're our brothers, so to speak, as Americans, but yet they are blind, and they don't know where true satisfaction comes from. Our forefathers did. Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington. They knew you. They knew where their real strength comes from. But here we see what Satan has done and where we're going. Lord, our hearts are crying out for people, for souls, because it's the love of God that sheds abroad in our hearts. And we're not willing that any should perish, but that all would come to eternal life. Lord, help us to be a light to those around us, Lord Jesus. to be salty, Lord, to those who have need of you, Lord. Father, our hearts are longing to see you one of these days. Any time now, we don't even know how it could go as far as it has. But yet, we look for you daily, Lord. And Father, we're praying God that this message that you sent to the earth through Malachi 4, God, that it would do its work, Lord, that it would accomplish that which it was sent out to do, and that is to get a bride ready for Isaac. Lord Jesus, that Eleazar, Brother Brandham came to bring us to Isaac, God. And we pray Lord this morning we come to church, we hear preaching, we hear sermons, but Lord, when we go back out, Father, do we really listen to that tutor, that Holy Spirit that tries to teach us things, to help us to overcome things, to tell us the right way to do things. Father, if there's any in here, Lord, that really desires that, Father, that in every aspect of their life, they want to be surrendered to you, Lord. May they raise their hand to you now. May you see those hands and say, "God, lead me, Lord. Guide me, Lord Jesus. Be my guide, Father." That's what we have in our hearts is a true guide to guide us through this darkness. and to guide us to a closer walk with you, to guide us into receiving every promise that's ours, every blessing that is ours. Father, as we go, Lord Jesus, we receive it, accept it, and help us to have faith, Father, so that Lord Jesus, one of the greatest signs to me in maturity, Lord, is to be able to control situations and conditions and so forth as they come our way, Lord, to conduct ourselves Christlike. So, we ask God for this in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. We love the You all love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's give him a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." God bless you. God bless you, brother Joshua. I want to see more of you. More of you. More of you. [Music] I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. of things I've had my fill, but yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. [Music] Oh, more of you. More of you. [Music] I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. of things I've had my f. But yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord hear my prayer for more of you. Amen. In the morning when I rise, give me Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; In the morning. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise. Give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. You can have all this world. Give me Jesus. And when I am alone, Lord, when I am alone, when I am, just give me Jesus. Oh, give me Jesus. Oh, give me Jesus. You can have all this world. But give me Jesus. When I am in prayer. Oh, when I am in prayer. Oh, when I am in prayer, Lord, when I am in prayer, just give me Jesus and give me Jesus. And give me Jesus. You can have all this world, but give me Jesus. [Music] Amen. It's good to be here this morning. Amen. As we go this morning, let's just sing I want to live the way he wants me to live. Oh, I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just
