TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salom had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone that on the door of the Sepulcher [Music] and entering into the Seer they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were AF frighted but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there ye shall see him as he said unto you now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God this one together and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following Amen brother brother Tommy thank you brother y'all can be seated trying his new mic set up here can hear me you can hear [Music] me well out all right all right try trying to get this good all right how y'all do this morning this morning I was like it's like our Super Bowl Sunday you know the resurrection well the world be hooping and to [Music] do all right are we ready now all right here we go now so we come this is gon to be our little pep rally huh we're gonna get fired up this morning what y'all come to do y'all come to praise the Lord you know I was thinking last night I got the looking in as I was putting some thoughts together uh you know I like this Psalm here he said how good and pleasant Psalm 133 how good and pleasant is it for the Brethren to dwell together in unity you know where where there's Unity there's power right you know in the next verse it said it's like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of the of his garments made me think what is that the oil the type of the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost is there's power there's power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost man manifesting himself you know it and you know we know the scripture says he said that where two or three are gathered in the midst he would be so we can all come and join together today in one mind one Accord in Christ Jesus this morning right blessed be the name of the Lord you know last time I was up here I wrote this down last time I was up here I wanted to do this and I was kicking myself when I got down there that I didn't do this so you know now everyone this morning I want you to speak with your mouth with me now I want y'all all to say this morning you know let's let's all oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus speak it with your own mouth for dying for me for ding for me Lord Jesus I invite you into this service in into our hearts and our minds that you have your will your will and speak that you your will and your way to speak to us today you know and and it just made me than you know that's just us inviting him down to where we are in our seats today you know you know brother Brian you want to uh pray for us and pray for the [Music] service yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord amen you know so so this is where my heart's been lately and it should be daily you know as we've been approaching this Resurrection Day it's making me think and I wrote this to the group the other day and it was just kind of kind of ironic I thought that brother Steve uh asked me to do this when everything that's been on my heart you know as we've been approaching this day you know I as I fellowship with people at work and you know you you're around people a lot you know they don't think spiritual a lot like we do you know but so when you can ask people you know you know you know my spot lost my spot you know being around people for just what are we here for you know when you can ask people and think and you just see people you know you ask them ask yourself what are we really here for you know to just come die come live and die what did Jesus come for just to go die on the cross and and pay for our sins you know what's the big purpose of life you know is it to be a good guy raise a family just do the best you can at life and hope it's good enough at the end or is there a greater bigger picture you know so as my thoughts began to I had I was going down the road one day I pulled over and was just writing this in my phone I was just it was just coming to me and it was just so rich and I wanted to share it but you know it's more of a king of glory come down clothed in himself in fleshly body called his son to redeem the Fallen creation and pay with us pay with his life for the sins of the world and do his will paid the most cruelest death why because he allowed the fall to come to bring us back and show his love to redeem us being likened unto us that we now can accept his free love gift by faith in God that now we can repent and get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we now are dead and B to ourselves daily that is the Great Big King that we serve that can live through us again in fellowship with us as as he was with Adam or Jesus now we can relive our book of Acts and he said the works that I do you shall do also the the shine s all them that believe Greater Works shall you do because I go to the father see the bigger picture now that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world his family of sons and daughters building himself a word bride bone of his bone flesh of his flesh John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God see what a privilege we have when we read this word we look at the Bible I was thinking about it one day when I was just sitting there thinking on the Lord looking at the word I'm like you know we look at that word that's the mind of God you know that was his mind them thoughts made manif went to you know is what what a privilege and honor that we are no greater time down through the sands of time that God's brought us a prophet like we have now and the revelation of the hour to live where we are is a more intimate relationship with Jesus Christ the word because it's just like a husband and wife more in an intimate relationship than just a regular old friend is Jesus Christ Living Through us and bringing the manifestation of the revelation of the hour blessed be his name you know now it's now now I got winging on that there so he said I said now look it's it's now that that's we are believers he allows us our relationship to grow more intimate that's more than book more than a book of pages called a b or Jesus on the cross story or a Manger in Bethlehem it's a god with skin on it again huh that it is a god with skin on and showing his attributes displaying himself the word in us like a billboard for Christ like we must display him his word now we have trials and tribulations that mold and shape our character just like he did in Jesus huh God is love and love is corrective he'll allows sickness to come to show his attributes that he's a Healer he had to allow death so that he could mend your wounds and give you hope to see your loved ones again he had to allow you to get Bound by slavery of the devil from religion to drugs to prison to prison in your own body to show you that he came to set the captives free and so that when when you know when he when he set you free it's a peace that passes understanding and joy unspeakable and full of Glory it's godliness with contentments great gain blessed be the name of the Lord you know he said it's the love of God that shed abroad in our hearts God himself made himself a tabernacle of Flesh living and dwelling in our hearts again so let us die and surrender and get out of the way that you may live again through us today you know I love you Lord you going put slide number one up you know this this slide number one here if you see this up here I thought it was pretty cool we'll just let it play is it playing it's just a little timelapse of an almond tree this time lapse shows from March 4th to se September 20th the time lapse of what it takes for almond to bloom when you come into the presence of the king you can do it in a moment a twinkling of a ey what what was it what was iron Rod when it was back there then it bloomed it blossomed bloomed and budded and brought forth almonds all in 24 hours but you come in the presence of the king he can do the same thing you know just I thought that was so awesome when you just look at that I just thought we could just let it play but when you come into the presence of life it Chang look at Lazarus he was dead but he was alive when he spoke you know we already know that he said if he hadn't spoke Lazarus everybody would have came forth blessed be the name of the Lord because when you come in contact with life life changes you you know he said what about the woman after well she was dead in sins and trespasses but when Faith struck that life produced a new life in Christ blessed be the name of the Lord but you just look at that rod in the presence of life that stick brought forth life in the presence of life oh hallelujah what it is to be in the presence of the truth the life and the way Jesus Christ glory to God and then you look here he says and behold the of Aaron the house of Levi was budded and brought forth Buds and blossomed and bloomed and yielded almonds on down it said and the Lord said unto Moses bring Aaron's Rod again uh before the testimony to be kept for the for a token and you slide down the verse chapter 18 and the Lord said unto Aaron thou and thy sons in thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy Sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of the priesthood so it got to really getting me all fired up because I just thought about that branch in the back there in the holies the holies bringing forth life it got me to thinking on that what what was so awesome is when he asked me to do this and we know this is a Resurrection Sunday and in my Bible study I mean my my study Bible here at the bottom it says Aaron's Rod that but it was a type of Christ in the resurrection owned of God the high priest Aaron's priesthood had been questioned in the rebellion of course so God himself will confirm each tribe has a per perfectly uh dead Rod you know it just made me think of a type of all the churches today but in Jesus Christ today the bride liveth you know but it said God put life into erands only see all the authors of religion have died Christ among them but only Christ had raised from the dead and exalted to be the high priest is that still going you can go to slide number two and he said can you than Jesus Jesus said I'm the resurrection and the life he that believes on me though he be dead he shall live again think we are now behind the torn Veil into the holies of holies you see there you you see the holies of holies now the high priest and he says right here he said in Matthew 27 he said and behold the veil of the temple was rent uh twine Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks was rent and the graves open up and many [Music] get up on out of here with the Lord Jesus when he comes to take us back blessed be the name of the Lord and then you go to the Hebrews here he said for for as then as the children of partakers of the Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same and through the death of the of the same though through the death the mighty tongue through there he Mighty destroy him that had the power over death that is the devil and to deliver them who through the fear of death were of a lifetime uh subject to bondage for verily he took on him the not the nature of angels He took of him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made liken unto his Brethren he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for that in that he himself suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted blessed be the name of the Lord and the next verse says and wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus I just love that we thank you so much Lord for all that you do for us and and I wanted to read here a little bit here so I I was looking in in Leviticus and exodus and when you start going I was really going to do a whole long reading but I don't think I'm going to do all that I was going to read this and make it just feel like man man he is reading and going on but but I'm just going to summarize what I was going to do I was going to read it and read it for verse for verse and make it and really just bringing out of how they had to go do this they had to go do this they had to do this you know everything had to be in specific orders all this all these sacrifices and all this labors that they had to do and all this and when they built it they had to have this this this this this all all that God had had them to do or they had to sacrifice you know what Aon and all them things you know all the things you know it goes on pages and Pages you know I was going to read all that but I was going to read enough to make you me like my goodness he's going to keep on going and going ain't he but you know what I wanted to do that for was I wanted to show the details and the labor and the order that's only a tip of what we can imagine in our day what what it must be like we can only imagine what it must be like if we have to we have it so easy Jesus Paid for us when you think about it you know what we do we come to church we just come to the church read your Bible you know you know hang on what's going on hang on he says and we live our life with Simplicity we can do as you will he said do as you will you know but but if we if we don't find that the hardest part is to die to oursel so he can resurrect in us another Life of Christ and then he turned from a rule book of do this or do that in this order or into a love story bringing the oil and the wine the fresh Revelation and the Holy Ghost in us the hope of glory our Earnest expectation of our inheritance sitting in Heavenly places right now that's the peace of God that passes under understanding that that's something brothers and sisters that's what we're living for now that that that that's what life is about that's God in us again that's us in fellowship with our creator what he saw in his mind before the foundation of the world now we're reliving it again here on Earth when leot seeing uh crying all this and that and all this and that when I'm talking to my buddies and my friends and this and that I'm like you ain't got to look at all that junk on Tik Tok or this and that I ain't got to worry about all that cuzz why we're shut in with God blessed the name of the lord it's so wonderful to be shut in with God because Christ tore the veil of the holies of holies you know they only got to go back in there once a year but Jesus Christ being now made the high priest of our confession tore that Veil we can come to him daily confessing our sins coming to that sacrifice that he done laid his life down for us that we can live again so you just think how simple God made it he made it that if we can just take our how simple God made it and made it for us to die to yourself daily take up your cross and follow me he says he said if you continue in my words you are my disciples indeed I like Ecclesiastes he says fear God and keep my commandments so then then I was just thinking how simple it is when you look at all the order and all the things that they had to do in the Old Testament and then you just stop and think about our life we repent daily we read our Bible the bread of life we we bathe in the washing of the water of the word he cleanses us and he clothes us with his righteousness we come to the we come to the house of God for correction fellowship with one another we take communion eat his body drink his blood and wash each other's feet in humility forsaking not the assembling of ourselves you know that we that he says forsaking not the Sim and and the more the more as you say the approaching and exhort and pray for one another daily it said faith in the word meaning re Revelation equals action it always did when you come into contact with life you're going to go and grow and bring forth fruit and doe season it made me think about I I like when Brother Brad brought out brother brandham he when he said brother brandham saw uh uh the Lord made Adam and he said he made him out of the clay or whatever and he said it looked like his feet look like Roots when he bre breathed the life into him he went straight on into action bless be the name of the Lord you can't help it you know it's just a life lived Walking With Jesus you know in conclusion I had a little thought I thought it was I thought it was just powerful how the Lord just drops the little things down to your mind but yeah I was driving down the road the other day on the way home and it's Buzzard you know how usually i' I've hit buzzards I don't know if y'all have or not cuz they fly last minut but this one I was like I'm driving down through her and most time you know I slow down cuz that stupid buzzer I don't want to hit the windshield you know and and this time I'm like I ain't even slowing down and and you know most time even a buzzer the last minute he'll fly off you know what I'm saying and and he this dude held his own I I didn't even really scoot over either he held his own I got to thinking later on I was like look at that that buzzer was so hungry he was Fearless it made me think that's the way we ought to be in Christ Jesus we should be so hungry hungering and thirst thirsting after Christ Jesus after righteousness that we are fearless in God we can come boldly before the throne of grace standing on his word feeding on his word man it's just so powerful I thought that's just I just thought that was really good but anyway uh I got another slide we're GNA end it with that and then once once it's done and then over to you brother and listen to what the prophet had to say a little quote today God bless you [Music] amen he [Applause] [Applause] amen [Music]

chapter 4 1 John chapter 4 and we'll begin with let's just I I wanted to come back and read some of this we might mention it but for now we'll just read it all beloved let us love one another verse S beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that love loveth not knoweth not God for God is love and that's the point we want to make there is that God is love amen amen now notice this will go along with John 3:16 in this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him amen herein is love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins and beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US amen now in my Bible you go back and will we read verse 16 amen hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren amen now let's go to uh another one over in Ephesians Ephesians 3 three now I want to read two more scriptures and then we'll let you have your seats Ephesians 3 and verse 8 unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God one page back Ephesians 1 and verse 9 goes along with the scripture that we just read one and verse 9 says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance be being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counil of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in God Amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen praise the Lord so this is I really want to get to my subject amen that I've tried to get to the last three service and we want to try to get right down to amen and amen talking about what we really wanted to to speak of and where we was going but there was so much of that other that I really thought was good amen and I hate to miss anything and so amen I just love when the Lord just amen begins to amen pour out his goodness to us amen I truly believe that there is a fountain that God has that's open amen amen and any preacher that desires it any person that desires more of the knowledge and more of God I believe there is a SP so to speak amen that you can turn open amen and you can get more of God if you really want more of God I was them but there was a Hollywood black Hollywood fellow I'm not sure if it was 50 cents it wasn't 50 Cent but one of them guys amen that was talking about Trump and how that he believes Trump's going to be in again he says but it doesn't really matter anyway because we're almost at the end anyway it's all all the whole world is about finished anyway imagine that coming from a Hollywood star they even it really doesn't matter who going in we're so close to the end and they know that it's so close to the end and it right and I believe it was Poland's uh leader over there Poland uh uh warned the Europe European countries he says you better be ready because war is coming amen that's what some of the leaders are saying amen and would begin to think about how late an hour it is and how that brother bandam amen being gone since 1965 believeing having been over with by 1977 close to 50 years past what he expected it to go talking about the car will go all the way to theor amen I it just almost shakes you much it kind of has to be a wakeup call for all of us to realize that it could happen any time the Rapture could happen any time and I'm very curious of how many is going to be left here for the tribulation period how many of us message preachers how many message churches are going to be left here in the tribulation period hello so it is a late hour amen and just coming from where it came from I was like even they recognize that he me we're at the end look at our president wanting to spend what eight more trillion or something like that no care about the debt and all of that just man made Easter amen a national day for the trans uh transgender uh what did v j transgender day of visibility is what our president made our Easter out of it with a great big bunny rabbit ain't that right how many know Easter isn't about big bunny rabbits and it sure ain't about transgender but what is it amen just mocking God is that right but how many knows it has to get that way because the pro of God see Place burnt to a chis how many know that's the future of America amen is to be completely burned over amen so I say I believe it's a wakeup call I believe that we ought to shake ourselves and say where am I at with Christ amen I got a little something that came to me this week and you know sometimes young people you might say well if I'm in a message and if I'm in a Christian amen what is it that I should do and can do and what can't I do amen but you know I thought about this I thought that's not really the appropriate question the real right question is what do you want to do amen how believe is a real Christian it's about whether you desire the right things or the wrong things if you claim to be a Christian you're still Desiring the wrong thing you still got the love of the world in your heart and the love of God is not in there amen this morning with the help of the lord we want to talk about another aspect another essence of God because we know the believer amen according to and I'll just go it right quick if I can and we'll just read it again wasn't going to he says but first Peter says that ver chapter 1 verse4 whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises but that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen and then of course it goes on all of those aspects of what God is so we're on how many believes that as a Christian we take on a div divine nature the very life of God is to be in you and me amen if there's two things that are Prophet Us in the token message amen a perfect love message he says lay aside everything all of your religious demonstrations and all these other stuff am me aren't going to count to anything only the literal life of Jesus Christ is going to be going into Rapture so if you ain't living Christ's life out to you this morning forget everything else until you get nothing but that Holy Ghost life in you nothing El is going says it'll take perfect love to put you there so if you ain't got the perfect love of God in your heart don't worry about everything else make sure you get the perfect love of God in your heart we want to talk about the love of God with the help of the Lord this morning for a little while amen first thing we realize is that the very essence the very being of God God Amen according to John's this here he says for he that loveth no he that loveth not knowth not God because go for God is love amen I was wondering if I could get permission to go as long as we want this morning this is Easter amen I'm glad to see everybody this morning because I want to say something you know but B says you know sometimes people you wish him mer uh Happy Easter or whatever at Christmas because you won't see them till Easter again amen so we're glad to see everybody at least we showed up on Easter amen you know there something else about Easter you know about the Jesus Christ but you know we do that every week how many know we honor the resurrection because rose on the first day of the week on Monday what we call Monday but Sunday oh boy here we go am me Sunday used to be Monday well figuratively speaking you know Monday is the beginning of our week right but Sunday used to be the beginning of the week is that right because Saturday is the Sabbath day Saturday is the Sabbath then Sunday used to be the first of the week so it it's been that's why I said it that way way amen but because that he rose on this day we come to church but B says we come to church and amen we honor that Resurrection because that's the day he was Rose so Glory but how many know we don't just oh my Paul said you know sometimes we celebrate Easter we celebrate Christmas we celebrate this that or the other you know but how many knows that we're really not about all that because we're Eternal beings amen and we don't even have to worry about that anymore because we're in Christ now and all those things are fulfilled in Christ amen the amen he's given us a perfect rest how many glad to have a perfect rest what is the rest of God let me tell you what the rest of God is the rest of God means that who has ceased from his own works now you get to rest in God cease from your own Works God help us and me let that get down in our hearts we have ceased from our own work then you can have a Sabbath amen praise the Lord I'm going to just uh take off and I'm goingon to read the quotes that I've wanted to read for about three weeks we're going to read the quote and start from there so the very essence God is the very essence of God is love we know that love is the glue I'm not not sure I'm thinking maybe it was the Statue of a perfect man when brother Brandon preached that he says you know that whenever love comes down you have all these other things but when that perfect love it kind of cements it all together isn't that the way you put it am mean it's almost like a glue that it just glues it all together why because glue keeps families together love all right the love of God Is Like Glue that keeps a relationship together it brings the world together it formed the world it did all of these things hate on the other side on the other hand destroys I mean know hate is the opposite of love it destroys and it divides and so forth amen so we're thankful that God is love we want to talk about his love here for with the help of the Lord if we can amen listen to this and perfect love amen is uh or or God's love now notice how that God loved us from the very from the very beginning he loved us and everything that he did was because of Love is that right everything he did was because he loved that's why we read that amen about for God so loved the world he didn't come to condemn the world but he came that the world might have eternal life that whosoever whoever believeth on him amen and that love is a love that shares is that right it was it says it says there that it's not that we have loved God first but God first loved us and now we love him ain't that right first God loved us and now we get to reciprocate and have that same love back for almighty God Amen a few days brother says a few days ago I was sitting talking to my loyal little friend here in the city a medical doctor Sam Adair and he says how are you doing bill and I said oh pretty fair I suppose Doc and I said yourself and he said oh I had a lot of patience and said we had about 15 examinations this afternoon I said well that's good as long as it's just examinations and finding nothing wrong I says you know we got to talk about back when we were boys and I says well doc I know I don't know just how long I've been going to going to be around we're both in our 50s and he said that's true bill and I said but all of these years about 31 years of ministry now I have kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes how many believe that's important it's important that you keep their heart ready for that hour when he does show let me just say this again this is the hour folks this is the time this is that last watch is that right Jesus said if you if you watch you would have not suffered your home to be broken up if you're ready that's who he's coming for No Doubt but all most of us sitting here maybe not all of us you know but most of us sitting here are are going to experience that isn't that right we're either going to leave because we're ready or we're going to experience being left because we weren't ready amen we're in that hour folks so he was wanted to be ready so it isn't so it doesn't matter when he comes and so he said that's true and I said I said the greatest thrill the greatest thrill that I have brother bam says the greatest thrill of brother Bam's life and what he had was is living for others living for others amen he said that's what makes life real is when you not what you could do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others amen amen listen to this see that's what's that's when you're really living never did that try to LIF somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give somebody else in life and you'll find that it's more bless Riches of anything that can be thought of Amen does the bible teach us that it is more blessed to give than it is to receive the giving of ourself now about even the Bible says you know he said that we are supposed to present our bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable servant your very life is supposed to be a life of sacrifice to God Amen my it's more blessed all the riches of anything can be thought of is what you can do for somebody else to make life's burden which life itself is a burden amen anybody ever try to get out of it oh I'm just G to get out of I'm gonna have life easy no you still got to get up and make your coffee and get dressed and shower and take care of your problems of the day life is a burden listen it is a burden and it will make make a little lighter for somebody else you just don't know the joy unless you've tried it once amen and this is the nessage um the bru serpent when brother bam goes on to saying talking about having been on the ministry for 31 years and he was stepping down from that Ministry at this hour and during that time that he preached that he I'm stepping down because people have made me Jesus Christ they want to say that I'm Jesus Christ and that would make me an antichrist and I'm stepping down because of it getting out of the ministry y'all remember that amen and of course those Brothers repented and so forth and brother brandham get back on this got back on uh the ministry and so forth and he seen that serpent that was bruised isn't that right it didn't quite die even Joseph today able admit it that that isn't quite bad yet people want to make Joseph Jesus it's a spirit it's an antichrist spirit amen but anyway and listen to what he says before we go on now notice he says now notice he says and that brings me to thinking of 31 years will soon be of Ministry for the Lord and I guess every man thinks of sometime when he has to come to his last last service or come to his last hour and look back down the path and see what has been accomplished see what's went on have you did anything is that right is that a good question it's going to be a good question when you go to come down to your deathbed folks I'm here to tell you you're not going to think about what you made or how much you gained in this world it isn't going to mean nothing the only thing that's going to come to your mind for what service did I do for the Lord how did I serve the Lord amen amen can I go slow amen what did we do when we look back down what did we do for the Lord what kind of a life is a Christian life isn't that a good question amen let's see here I'm going to go to Mark 9 Mark 9 let's think about this what have you done have you did anything amen the disciples you know they had arguments with themselves about who's going to be the greatest isn't that right what did they accomplish how great are they going to become a that right and in chapter nine of St Mark I believe it is chapter 9 and verse 34 and he came to cernium and being in the house he asked them isn't that something now they had to from what I understand they had this conversation amongst themselves but Jesus knew what was going in their mind so he brings this up is that right he brings this up and asked them what is it that he disputed amongst yourselves by the way but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed amongst themselves who should be the greatest and he sat down and he called the 12 around him and said unto them if any man desire to be the first the same shall be last of all and servant of all see folks I wonder sometimes if people aren't just trying to be number one the greatest the greatest you want to be the greatest greatest greatest how many knows God the greatest of all became servant of all so much servant until he took a tub of water and washed Peter's feet Peter no no we have we've got a footwash flunky can wash our feet you're not the footwash flunky huh but Jesus rebuked him no and what did Jesus says what I do thou knowest not now but I'm giving you an example that you should do as I have done to you how many believe that God Jesus Christ was the example of perfect love amen and of this is and the world that we're living in with which is what I want to go back and pick up amen it's about not being the greatest but to be servant of everybody even him being you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have wash your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example you should do as I have done unto you amen and so as you notice how Jesus Christ sets the mind frame hey don't worry about being the greatest be the smallest be the servant of everybody that what's going to amen Matthew 10 Matthew 10 he puts it another way 10 and 25 Jesus said the disciple is not above his master he says nor the servant above his Lord it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his Lord if they have caught me the Master of the House be elub how much more shall they call them of his household amen fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known so if you'll notice there he says that you know it is enough that the disciple be as if they called him be El how many know the God of all creation took the lowest name that could be called which was the chief of devils the elub your beab he took the last name so when you're persecuted when you're called this when you called that don't don't despise that know that they called him the chief of devils and what did God do not only did he take him and call him the lowest name but he G he took the low job he became servant to his disciples what was that that was the very love of God living for others living for others amen now I want to start my little journey again amen take a little trip way back again before the foundation of the world when he was alone Amen Let me see how I wrote it down here well before I do that I wna re more quote is that okay Jesus he was just one man the perfect man and he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life wo Glory how many do it if you really want perfectly eternal life then that is a life that is about living for others not what you can get for yourself that doesn't count one B you get no brownie point you get no marks for anything that you accomplish for yourself but what you do for others give and it shall be given unto you press down good measure and running over it's more bless blessed to give than it is to receive but we have it wrong don't we we like when we get stuff but it's better when you get one giving stuff amen praise the Lord that's perfectly eternal life when you say brother Tommy had this up I think last week when you say that you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life huh should we have an altar call right about now how much of your spent time do you spend living for yourself huh a't that right don't we do it y'all are just keep your hands down this guy up here spends way too much time living for himself hey my wife doesn't cook quite right she roast to roast a little bit too roasty I'm like honey it was too roasty it's too dry don't cook it quite as often you're not not quite as long this morning we put a pot roast in there and everything I said you didn't turn it on yet did you wait till we go to church that way it's still a little juicy when we come back we're about get the argument about the roast said keep me keeping my mouth shut and say honey this is some wonderful roast huh why because we're so much about us how many knows that's why marriages are in trouble like they are because people are thinking about their self amen thinking about their self you don't have eternal life brother B says if you're living it just for your own self eternal life is living for others it proved it when he come into the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day on Calvary amen oh someone said how can you stand to let someone call you such names you don't live for yourself you live for others so that you might redeem that man you become Sons but the trouble of this to the church they forgot that they're Sons your we are taking Christ oh boy the old Pope amen he says on his crown VI carious feel it is instead of the Son of God but he's got it wrong I'll tell you who's dead instead of the Son of God aen it's his church you are in his that how many believe this is where Christ is living out his life the same things he did but the reason oh here we go amen the power of almighty God is because there's not enough of the power of God over in here you ain't got to produce nothing all you got to do is yield this here to the Holy Spirit and when you pray God will take care of it amen we don't have to produce wool amen we just bear wool how many feels like live too much for yourself go ahead I still live too much for myself too much for myself too selfish self like I told you I don't know if anybody didn't hear me but s e LF take the S put it over here selfish i h take the I put it over here you got s i n s sness selfishness take the N over here it spells s i [Applause] n how many know selfishness is sin think about the time I'm glad that God wasn't selfish I'm glad that God isn't selfish oh my we're going to talk about that this morning God not being selfish amen praise the Lord you are taking Christ's place you are Sons so don't live for yourself live for others amen well brother bam I can sure live for this brother because he is sure a nice man huh that's right that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who'd kill you if they [Music] could pray for those that despitefully use you and mistreat you when somebody slaps you on the cheek turn the other cheek somebody ask you to go to my go to you can afford it you're a rich man you got eternal life you ain't worried about world if somebody takes your coat give him your cloak also woo it's what the Bible says love your enemies if you can't love your enemies you ain't got the right kind of God in your heart any anytime you got Hate in Your Heart it isn't God anger despise somebody don't like that person you remember that's the devil in you hello it's not God Amen listen to what he says he that saith that he's in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now he that loveth his brother abideth in light and there is none of occasion of stumbling in him but he that hated his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whether he goes because that Darkness has blinded his eyes woo hello how many believes no place for hate we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we love the brother Jesus said by this shall all people know that you're my children my people when you got love one for another when you care about one another how many know God cared he loves he cares I've got a quote Better B says you got to be able to feel for people if you get feel for people then you can help people Lord help me to feel more he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity is that right my mind that's right he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a [Applause] murderer think about it when a person has a hate for somebody else called you Bible just called you a murderer how many knows Cain hated Abel and what was he he was a murderer Lord take all hate out of my heart take it out of my life amen you're living in a world where Christians are the nicest people that you'll ever meet the most kindest the most long-suffering the most giving but yet the devil seem fit to slaughter 68 million of them down through the Dark Ages people do anything for you we're living in a cruel terrible World we're living in the devil's [Music] Eden I don't want to be here when he's kicked out of heaven and he has but a short time time he said woe to the inhabitants of the Earth at that time for the devil has come down to you the bride will be taken up there'll be no we just don't know we can't see into that realm but we know there's another realm there isn't there okay praise the Lord now notice oh I hope brother said oh I hope this helps you he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you've got that in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like sheep does its wo look on T's Calvary amen think of about the thing that we try to give up we give up our time on Sunday morning on Wednesday man we sacrifice our time to pray and read and and give our hearts to God how many know that's part of the sacrifice not living for yourself well I ain't got time to do this I ain't got time to pray you selfish thing hello you can't do what God asked you to do you're selfish you expect him to take you in a Rapture uh Lord help us this morning it's checking up time you better find out where your love is what you love Jesus if where your treasure is and your heart be also Lord help us amen don't you just love him all right okay that's right when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then you look on towards Calvary I hope this helps you get to a place that's what the Tabernacle that's what all people has got to do is find out what you are and what's the purpose Church isn't going to church just to play music and sing songs church is a place of corrup judgment begins at the house of God you must reckon yourself ourself dead and alive to Christ then he made the way that we could sacrifice ourselves to follow his service and to follow him if we follow him he will lead the life we will lead the life that he led that's wonderful then he goes on to talking about he says when the Judgment Day comes he'll she separate the sheep from the goats he'll say when I was hungry you gave me no food when I was in prison you give me no you didn't visit me when I was naked you me no clothes you didn't do nothing but the Sheep he says all of these things you have done amen praise the Lord notice he says keep this in your heart they didn't say they when did I do this and when did I do that it was so unconsciously done the people don't do it as a line of duty how many knows it can't just be a li of Duty well I ought to I don't really want to but I guess I will we just lost every Lord don't even do it why it's got to be in your heart to do it brother B says why do I go amen over these countries and so forth in the airplanes through storms and dropping and amen and almost wrecking and them telling on the speaker we got five minutes of gas left we better find the airport and we're crashing scared to death he says why do I do all of that I do he says and then he said see I do it because of the love of God that's in my heart how these when we come to church we come because we love to when we worship it's because we love to when we sing sacrifice our time we like the sacrifice the fruit of our lips saying [Music] am Hallelujah man people break come to the house of God and they can't sacrifice a thing can't dance a little enough can't make no sacrifice for God God help us this morning he sacrificed everything for you and for me you love him that's right think about it not a line of duty amen it's more than the line of d Duty Christianity is more than a bunch of do and don'ts amen I think brother Tommy picked that up a little bit it's more than that it's a life amen all right we're ready to start now praise the Lord back when God was alone that perfect life all by himself amen I like going back sometimes don't you see Paul said that he wanted to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery Amen to the intent now that the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God the whole plan of God be made how many glad to be able to understand the secrets of the universe the mysteries of the universe why is there such suffering why is there such pain why is there such Evil all of things are answered amen we understand them now don't we way back when I got to thinking about this he was all by himself way back amen he was all by himself his very essence is love his very essence was love and you just it was all bottled up huh all bottled up trying to get out I got to Express this I want to express what's in my heart how many knows when you love somebody you express it there's no expression there's no love but he want to express this number one thing the most powerful force in the universe what is great is hope faith charity Paul said the greatest of Faith greatest of Everything Is Lost nothing is powerful is lost whatever you love you'll do you'll end up do you'll find a way to do it amen bottled up just God by himself all alone all by himself Millions maybe billions of years what we would call in our time billions and billions and billions and billions see as long as I keep saying billions I kind of bring some kind of imagination in my heart of a time span of God ain't that right but it's illogical and not true because he never had a beginning so it wasn't billions and billions he always was and that's more than what the human mind can comprehend I can't go back that far it's just not deep enough maybe if my head was this big I don't know but [Music] think back to all by himself and he had to love and he began to think you know I don't want to be by myself I believe one place brother the B said that God was lonely is that right God was lonely and he wanted companionship brother says this way and he begin to think here in is set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own how many knows the very family unit is a representation of what God had in his mind amen he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a husband he wanted to love his children R he wanted to love his wife he wanted to get that feminist part amen of himself amen and make a help meet so to speak a companionship we understand the manold wisdom of God of what he thought of and what expressed it and he got to begin to think in his mind how do I have it wrote down here oh my amen I started this page and then I started this page said the some same thing and forgot I had wrote it over on the other one amen and he begin to think I will start this thing the first thing he had to do is begin to think about [Applause] it first thing he did was come up with a plan how many know God has a plan that's right having made known unto us the mystery of his will or his plan according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that's right praise the Lord begin to think about it and he begin to think about Adam he began to think about Eve he think about a man he thought about a woman how I'm going to how I want toess how am I ever going to express my love to them right and I'm going to be expressed through them and what did he do created Adam that right Adam and Eve of course we know was at one time both together isn't that right they were both together and he says I'm going to create a man and it's not going to be good that he's alone cuz it's not good that I'm alone how many know God doesn't want to be alone God a going to be alone somebody's going to be with him somebody's going to sit by by his side he's going to be on the throne with him they do in order to express himself Express his love but you know I mean this could take till 2 three o' because how many knows that he did not just have God is just not God because God means an object of worship he's not just God but he's also in God is to be father that right he had so many things that he wanted to express is that right father husband Redeemer savior deliverer mighty warrior is that right he want to express all of this and he's like what how am I going to do this how am I going to express all of this because I don't want to just express love but I'm going to express that love through Deliverance I'm gonna have to create love I'm going to have to create the opposite of life I'm going to have to create adversity is that right now I'm gonna try to have to make a long story short but as he created the angels all of the angels He created does anybody know what Lucifer's name was before it was Lucifer and all this I'm not sure if he had a different name before the fall or Not Here I Am A preacher preaching on and I don't know Bible says how art thou Fallen oh L of the morning that right say what now yeah okay makes sense how art thou Fallen oh Lucifer son of the morning amen because you were there what did God do he put all he put him and he put the angels on freeall agency he says I'm going to have to create a channel that's fair but put men and even Adam and Eve on freeall agency ain't that right he's going to know he knew what was going to happen the devil is not stupid and neither is God stupid stupid amen like some people think is he knew what would happen he knew what had happened he know how it would go of course Angels the devil took Lucifer took a third of the angels with him is that right preached his message of you know God gets all the glory we don't get enough Glory we want some Glory woo you got to watch that you got to watch that wanting Glory preachers got to watch that wanting Glory churches got to watch that want Glory Dayan cor wanted some Glory Moses you take too much we're spiritual too watch out that same Spirit want in glory amen God recognized what that was that right God says I recognize what's on that in that guy let me open up the Earth I kicked him out of heaven I'm going to kick him off the Earth and I'm put him in in hell right off straight straight to the gates of hell hello but anyway he says look we realize what happened through all of that how did the fall happen Ain that right because he could have never expressed it right and sometimes we think is a horrible place with death everywhere we ask in our mind how could God even allow some of those things like down through the Dark Ages the way that people were killed his own children were slaughtered and killed the way that they were huh it's hard for us in our finite mind to comprehend it can I say something something but you have to have a spiritual mind to really be able to comprehend it and to get it to get it all because I don't know about you but I don't like funeral homes I don't like hospital I don't like people suffering I hate to see those animals out there killing each other brutally sometimes teating on the back end while the front end's still alive trying to strugle away horrible and [Music] but God says I'll allow death I'm going to allow it how many know this is all Allowed by almighty God for what purpose and that is to express his love to you and I listen he had to allow us to fall because he could never express being a savior unless we fa oh here we go and it isn't all about the fall it isn't about the bad time it's about wisdom for for you to say lost he don't intend for you to say dead or to die he intends for you to believe and Paul said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that's to be revealed you could suffer for a lifetime you could be murdered in every fashion of effect it'll never compare with the glory of eternal life and the glory of Heaven does that make sense brother Glenn it does when you look at it the way you're supposed to Paul he suffered didn't he beaten with rods left for dead stone [Music] amen left Humanity to come the wrong way so that you got to be born again is that right listen he allowed to fall he allowed people to be empty allows you sometimes to feel like you're empty [Music] so he could fill you up the intent is not for you to fall and stay down that isn't God's intent God's intent is to pick you up cuz the Angels don't know what it's like to be lost they don't know what it's like to need a savior but oh how we can say Oh What A Savior Oh What A Savior is M God knew what it would cost him I mean if God knew the cost was there thinking about he says I'm I'm going to I'm going to make a law in the old test that he got to be amen if there's any Redemption if there's any coming back he got to be a Kinsman that does it made all those laws and there was one Kinsman that was closer to Naomi and Naomi than what the Boaz was there was a Kinsman closer and he had to decide whether he wanted to do the Kinsman work and he couldn't do it because he would Mar himself a rep representative of the devil the Devil Couldn't represent he could not redeem us so God took the job of redeeming us he knew what it was like to go to Calvary you know what it was like to be a human being and me not one to die and mean you know what it was like to suffer you know what it was like to have fa he knew what it would like to be rejected and his and rejected a man he knew that he was going to have to pay the ultimate price that he was going to have to die that's why I said way when he come back up again I am he which which was dead but I am alive forever more the intent wasn't just to die but it was to rise again to raise you up on Easter morning how many believes that we are already resurrected spiritually we're not dead anymore in sins and trespasses we're resurrected because that is expressing his [Music] love you don't know how happy you ought to be you don't know how happy you ought to be you don't know how happy you ought to be I don't know how happy I ought to be so let me tell you while the prophet said you ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth amen I if we ought to be the happiest people that there is this Easter morning all right want me to quit screaming holler I can calm down but this is worth shout about this is worth screaming [Laughter] about he was going to let us be sad so that we have joy unspeakable so we have the lober of the redeemed devil you don't have any more power over me you're nothing but a bluff devil yeah God heard our scream he heard our sh he heard our Victory cry and he was going to express it his love how does he Express his love God is so full of love you know how much love he has that he died on Calvary for God so love the world that he gave everybody he gave Kain a pass he gave every Center a pass he gave serpen SE a pass and said everybody that wants to come and you'll have life he pardoned everybody oh I wish the whole world could hear me he pardoned everybody but you got to accept that pardon what a loving God he didn't say just this one or just that one he said whosoever will who's it for anybody that wants to this tape may be played on the day of judgment people hear it out there God said anybody that wants to can be saved and the people listening their attitude towards what the God's word says will be played back huh he won't have to judge he'll say let's just hit the tape recorder this is what the preachers preach this is what the word of God says this was your attitude towards it one place them how many it your attitude towards the word of God is what either saves you or condemns you it'll be played back amen that's why when we speak about about this could we with ink the ocean fill and were the Skies of paper made parchment made where every stock on earth a quill and every man A Tribe by trade to write the love of God above what drain the ocean dry nor could the scroll contain the hole so stretched from Sky to Sky what wondrous love is this oh my soul oh my soul what wondrous love is this oh my soul oh my soul how many loves that worship him what wondrous love that God should love a sinner such as I amen should yearn to turn my sorrow into Simon such love such wondrous love such love such wondrous love that God should love a sinner such as I how wonderful is love life thank you Jesus thank you for your love Lord you did it all you did it all for me you live for me now Lord help me live for you thank you Lord Jesus we applaud you God you loved us he said I first got to create Earth I got to make a world for him to live in I'm going to create all this amen for you and for me he spent his life for you he spent his life for me did it all for his church and his people that's for me he made it for me he made it for you to express himself come all the stars every Star out there so we can see it the moon the star STS the sun everything he didn't live for himself he didn't keep it all to himself I don't always understand why brother why the Bible says God won't share his glory with any amen his honor and his respect but he truly does share himself with us how many he's glad for that he shares himself his very being he shares with you he shares with me that's what Easter means to me how did he express it I read you a couple of times he says he expressed this is how we identify this is how we see his love to us that while we were yet sinners he died he came and paid for our sin sins that's how we know that he truly did love us he does love us how many believe he loved you absolutely he gave his life for you paid for your sins wrote a pardon don't have to crawl on your knees two miles don't have to do no beads and Roses don't have to do no Rosary don't do all you have to do is accept it say Lord Jesus I accept it remember but says you can come to the altar and pray and pray and pray and pray and pray and pray and pray but until you accept it it won't do you any bit I believe it I believe what you did for me on Calvary that was for me he expressed it by dying to himself all right we're in the third quarter third that gives us two more quarters that's not too good is it this all right can I go a little longer got a couple okays there now I wanted to get to something that I told you I wanted to get to for some time already Ephesians you want to go with me Ephesians it sounds like a marital scripture between a husband and wife but Paul said that is he spoke this is a mystery great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church in chapter 5 of Ephesians in verse 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord and he is the savior of the body amen therefore as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands I like this husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it how many knows that a husband and a wife they Express the very sacrifice of Jesus Christ amen folks I'm here to tell you when a man marries a woman he isn't just to go free and do his own thing and have his own thing this that the other that wife becomes his responsibility he's there and he has to tend to her right and came for me how many's glad that we have a Heavenly Father we have a Heavenly husband that loves us when he's telling the husband to love the wives I'm here and God said I'm going to love my church I'm going to love my people amen for it that he might sancy and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish woo how many of us say I'd love to have a perfect husband husbands might say I want to have a perfect wife but guess what you're responsible for that amen and God is responsible to see to it that we are without spot without blemish just exactly like God wants us amen amen so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth him himself for no man ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherish it even as the Lord does the church if I could say anything under the inspiration is I believe that the Lord wants to have a more intimate relationship with each and every one of us how many knows that just doing Miracles this out or the other isn't isn't all of it because there's all people out there having faith to do it because on that day he says Haven we done this and haven't we done that he says I never had a relationship with you I never knew you intimately how many beli that walking with the Lord is a daily Affair you having a fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ about everything that you do how many believes the wife is supposed to be subject to her husband in everything spiritually speaking also isn't that right in everything be subject to our Lord Lord do you want me to do or don't you Lord I don't know about you but I pray God what do you want me to do today and whatever I'm doing I don't care what what it is Lord I want you there and bless say I know it makes a difference when I commit my day to God and I ask for him to lead me and to guide me amen especially pouring concrete Lord help this not to set up I've had nightmy it's all hard brother Tommy you all know about it we pray before you come over there Lord got you know anything you do an intimate relationship with almighty God Amen think about it how many how many's glad for the plan of God I think God had a wonderful plan I think it was perfect before he ever started it he knew the end from the beginning before it ever before he cast the first star out there before he even made the first Angel he already knew exactly how it would all end how many's glad to be in a god like that who cares brother BR says nothing's out of cater everything's going just exactly like it's supposed to our president doing what he did with Easters making an absolute blasphemy out of it he needs to do that why because he's got to get more filthy he's got to get so filthy that when God destroys this place he's 110% just in burning them [Music] cuz remember this ever since America turned down God in 1957 he hasn't been for us that's right right no when they turned him down but says don't even pray for it there's no coming back for America was he right or was he wrong he was absolutely right he says it won't beong in the whole world go completely insane folks right there complete Insanity then brother Braham says there'll be a woman dressed in some kind of a purple and if yall remember uh uh vice president Harris you had that purple kind same color dress on that was identified by the prophet of God my question is did that prophecy come and go and we didn't catch it he said to a woman be in power like president or in some great office isn't that right that is a great office vice president is definitely a great office and a woman in that you better have your eyes how been no these things happen so simple and so easy we don't recognize it if you aren't careful I'm not saying it is but I say like the prophet of God could it be that that woman is already there and the next thing was fire hello how many B we're right at the moment of fire fixing the fall well I'm expecting a pressure I'm expecting a squeeze I'm expecting those things too but remember this brother bam said all of these things could happen before morning that's right how many believe we better be ready I'm here to tell you as your pastor you better be ready you better have prayed up
