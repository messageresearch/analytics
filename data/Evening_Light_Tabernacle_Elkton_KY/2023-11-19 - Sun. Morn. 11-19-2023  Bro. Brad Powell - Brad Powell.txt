dismissed for Sunday school too and then if you'll just go in the Proverbs with me we're going to go to uh chapter 15 and then we're going to start in verse 16 which we read verse 16 last week but it's a really good one we'll start there and finish that Proverbs chapter 15 starting in verse 16 better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and Trouble therewith wrathful Man stirreth up Strife but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despises the mother without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counselors they are established the way of life is above to the wise that he may depart from Hell [Applause] beneath thoughts of the wicked are an Abomination to the Lord but the words of the pure are pleasant words heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth of the wicked porth out evil things Lord is the wick light of the eyes rejoices the heart and a good report maketh bones fat he that refuseth instruction despises his own soul but he that heareth reproof GTH understanding fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters a lot of good scriptures there in our Proverbs I was just thanking if it wasn't sacrifice of Jesus Christ this morning where talked about how the wickedness that's in people's mind oppresses the Lord it wouldn't be a pleasant place to be this morning if you didn't have that buffer for us this morning there uh if you would turn with me to um the 12th chapter of Mark I'll have to apologize I may a deposit on Friday and it's been over a month so some of you probably knew it been a while since I made a deposit but everything up to then I made on that deposit on Friday and uh as of right now this morning the everything's paid off you all know the church has been paid off for months so and the fuel's paid off the insurance is paid off and depending on how bad the winter is so we go into the new year with both the general fund F in the building fund having more than enough money for any emergencies but I was uh listening into some messages this morning and a thought came to me I I'll I'll I'll try not to read this whole chapter but I'm just going to read about the first 15 verses here in this chapter we all know this Parable pretty well this morning and this is what Jesus had to say and he began to speak unto them by Parable you know and brother bandam told you and the word tells us you have the ability now to know the mind of God all these Parables you know the revelation of and know the truth of this morning you should be raised in your hands and just grateful that God deemed you worthy to understand the word of God he goes on a certain man planted a Vineyard and said set a hedge about it and dig a place for the wine fed and built a tower and led it out to the husbandman and went into a far country we know we're talking about God himself and the children of Israel and this he's just talking to the Pharisees here and at that season he sent to the husband husbandman a servant that he might receive from the husbandman of the fruit of the vineyard so basically tenant Farmers cash rent type of farming he they went back the owner went back to get his money and and this is what they did they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty and then it goes on in the fourth verse and again he sent onto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him at in the head and sent him away shamefully handled and then again he sent another him they killed and many others beaten some and killing some so this land owner here was a pretty fair guide compared to what most land owners in our day would do and having yet therefore one son he's well beloved he sent him also onto to them saying they will reverence my son but the husbandmen said among themselves this is the hair come let us kill him and The Inheritance shall be ours and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard what shall therefore the Lord of The Vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandman and give away give the vineyard to others that's where we're at this morning and he goes on to say have you not read the scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner and this was the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes and you could go back to First Peter the 2 and third chapter where it talks about this but I was thinking something different this morning and then he's these are the Pharisees here this Parable he was actually you know and the Sadducees weren't as stupid as you thought we think they are or the Pharisees they they knew that Jesus was talking directly to him he was this and they understood this Pharisee what he's exactly was saying here and they sought let L hold him in fear but the fear of the people for they knew that he had spoken a parable against them they left him and went away they and it just goes continually it keeps going on talking about how they tried to uh tempt him and test him and through it all he was true to the word of God and then I I'll just read jumping into the 29th verse and the one one privately one of the F Sadducees asked him or one of the lawyers asked him privately what is the best first commandment of all and in the 29th verse says and Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is to hear here oh Lord Israel the Lord your God is one Lord and we know we have that Revelation this morning the very God Of Heaven and Earth speaks to you this morning through the word of God and his presence in your heart this morning amen and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment and this is I mean this goes back to uh the the Epistles of John the first the and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these and this scribe answers to the Lord backs and the scrib said unto him well Master thou has said the truth and he's just preaching the word right back to Jesus this morning just like we're expected to do ourselves thou thou said the truth for there is one God and there is none other but he and to love him with all thy heart and with all thy understanding with all thy soul with all thy strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifice so all the money you can give all the sacrifices you could give are meaningless unless these scriptures are abiding them unless you do everything in your life out of love for people and love for the Lord it it really ain't doing you any good my thought I don't have I was about to say something I won't say it but uh I say it a lot I we all have our own things that's all right but I'm thinking this morning go if you go with me to the third Epistle of John it's a real short one I was also hearing on that message one of the messages this morning was talking about that man Mr Andrews who had a wife that you know he thought had an appendix and then he found out he had she had a blood clot and he was a total unbeliever and he said he didn't need a preacher the doctors would take care of his wife and you know how everything F fully Cycles around where he comes knocking at at the door crying wanting brother brandom to to pray for his wife it just struck me this morning that's where we're at this morning that's what the world is likeed out there they don't think they need God this morning they don't need anything they got good doctors they got good education they got good everything they don't need any faith they don't need to believe believe in a living God but what's funny is God has a tendency to Humble The Humble people when they think when you get where you think you're so high before you know it God's Got you down on your knees and sometimes it's even got you lower than your knees before you realize that everything that you have or everything you're ever going to do is by the grace of Jesus Christ this morning and I was just think I wrote a note to myself here but I'll I listened to this chapter several times but if I mispronounce some of these words you'll have to forgive me this is what John said the Elder onto the wellbeloved Gallas whom I love in the truth so he's talking to this I don't know if he's a deacon or a pastor or this just a believer so John's writing this epistle to Gallas beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper for I Rejoice greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou wst in the truth I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in truth I'm assuming the Lord feels the same way about this morning beloved thou th Faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the Brethren and to The Strangers so both to the the church and to the unbeliever he's saying here which have borne the witness thy charity before the church whom thou bring forward on their Journey after a Godly SW Thou shalt do well because that for his name's sake thou went forth Tak nothing of the Gentiles so not want to receive anything for himself ought to receive such that we might Fellowship in the truth and then there's a negative here in at the end of this chapter I wrote onto the church but theopus who loveth to have the pr so I was saying it's already happening here that's 2,000 years ago Christ had only been off the scene for what 30 40 years and it's already starting and this is what he had preeminence among them that received us not wherefore if I come I remember his deeds which he doeth righten against us with malice words and not content therewith nether do he himself receive the Brethren and you this goes on a lot this morning forbidding them that would would and cast them out of the church so it was even happening 2,000 years ago beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of God and that goes back to what I was reading in mark this morning you know if a man's being good you can tell by the treasures that come out of his heart whether he's evil or he's good not that we have the right to judge people but you can tell by their character by their attitude by the things they do and they don't do who they are and you'd be surprised sometimes the sinner out there can have more brotherly love than Christians can have it's the truth sometimes they'll help people more than Christians to help people Brethren forbid of them that would cast them out of the church follow not that which is evil but which is good he that good doeth good is of God and he that doeth evil have not seen God and I'm just thinking of what brother brandham said here you know he you have a lot of preachers out there would tell you if you if you're going to live like a sinner you might want to live to the best you can but always here brother Ram saying always encouraging whether they're Sinners or Saint to live the cleanest and best life they know how to live and uh I my pronunciation D this had good had good report of all men and of the truth itself not the same person itself yeah he also bear record that you know that our record is true I had many things to right but I will not with think and Pen right on to thee but I trust so he says he's going to come there shortly but I trust that shortly see thee and will speak face to face peace be to thee and our friend salute thee greet our friends I just wrote this note to myself this morning and I was thinking if you were a Believer this morning whatever you're whatever your position was or whoever you are this morning young or old uh when you you know as I read that letter this morning could could your pastor write a letter to you like that this morning like he wrote like John wrote to Gallas could your wife or husband write a letter about about about you like that this morning could would your mother or father write a letter about you like that this morning and if they can't that it means there's something wrong with our experience there's something wrong where we're at this morning and we need to get you can't make yourself better I wouldn't say it that way you just need to get closer to Jesus Christ this morning brother David man you enjoy that this morning [Music] you just have to forgive me this morning do we went back there this morning to pray and the presence of the Lord so heavy this morning amen thank you I said Lord bless you here we are this morning in your presence there's a lot of people this morning are going to church but they're not in the presence of the heavenly father this morning and we have that honor and privilege to be his children this morning because blessed are your eyes they have seen and your ears they have heard

I'm I'm kind of in the same boat with Brother David I've just felt just a real presence of the Lord for the last day or two or leading up into studying and and uh I just think if we could take our time this morning God's got something in store good for us and so uh we just Thanksgiving coming up and I just want to say I'm thankful for the blood I'm thankful for the blood this morning and and I want to speak this morning if I could on Blood Bought rewards Blood Bought rewards and uh if you want to turn in your Bibles we'll turn in the Book of Romans read a portion of scripture there Romans 8 thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ and all that it does for us read you a quote real quick as you're turning Prophet says his first decision when man sinned and crossed that great chasm between him and God leaving himself no way back God full of mercy and Grace accepted a substitute Only a God that is full of mercy and Grace could do a thing like that and he accepted a substitute and that substitute was blood that's the only place that man could ever come in fellowship with God again is under the shed blood he said and it's never been any time that a man could fellowship with God but only by the blood and it is so true where he fellowships with God Book of Romans chapter 8 very familiar scripture as we're talking about the blood and and a chasms and things that that that draw I guess a separation sometimes between us and Christ and things that get in our lives and maybe can hinder us and hold us back and that we hold on to sometimes at creates a distance it feels like but there's always that blood and that blood never fails and looking here in Romans it says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that love loved us for I am persuaded that neither death I think this is one of brother B's favorite scriptures that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord you see we may have chasms in our lives and and and and but the thing to know that there is no Chasm that is that is too big it is too deep that is too wide no mountains Too Tall if we can put everything that hinders us or that holds us back if we can put it under the blood of Jesus Christ let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day for many blessings thank you for your grace and mercy and thankful today as we're coming in this Thanksgiving season we're thankful to be Americans we're thankful for for the the freedoms that we have and the liberties we have and but Lord more than anything we're thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ that covers our sins and and puts them into the sea of your forgetfulness I just read where the Prophet said you know he get Black Ink on his shirt and his his mama would take some coal oil and try to smear it around and and it would just make a big old blood but it wasn't until they come out with Clorox bleach and she could dip it in that bleach as just as the blood of Jesus Christ and it could never be found again we're thankful for that this morning we love you and dedicate this service into your hands now in Jesus name we pray amen you can have your seats I'm going to try to take my time and uh and and and we're going to have a little different this morning it's going to be some history involved and some history lessons but I think if you'll stay with me you'll see where we're going to go I'm also going to be reading quite lengthy out of uh exod Exodus 12 if you want to follow along and and looking at uh at this here for just a few minutes before we get into our text this will lay our foundation Exodus 12 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months and it the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take unto them every man a lamb every man a lamb oh the Lamb of God according to to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and if a house oh be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of souls every man according to his eating shall make count for the lamb watch now this lamb your lamb shall be without blemish yeah that's nothing we can live up to that's nothing we as as men or as Christians as Believers we can't live up to a to a an unblemished life but here it says your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat and they shall eat the Flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat eat not of it raw nor Soden with all the with with all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus you shall eat it and G about your loins your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand you shall eat and haast East it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be for you a token aren't you thankful this morning for the token aren't you thankful this morning for the blood that that that is is token over our lives saying that that we have been Blood Bought and we can receive the rewards of a Blood Bought Savior Jesus Christ and when I see the BL blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day be unto you for a memorial skip down to verse 21 if you'd like then MO Moes called for the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill for the Passover and you shall take a bunch of hisp and we look at this this herb this hsip is and there's significance there and and that the hsip is used for sprinkling and ancient Jewish rights of purification so when by taking the they're saying we need God to purify Our Lives we need something to clean us we need something to to help us to forgive us that's why David when you look in Psalms David was caught in the act of adultery with bath Sheba what did he say he said cleanse me with hup cleanse me with hup and basically he's saying cleanse me with hup cleanse me with the blood and I shall be clean and that's the only way why because this hipip signifies purification and it says and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lenol with the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning for the Lord will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood on the lentil and on the side poost the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer did you hear that the Destroyer he will not suffer the Destroyer to come into your house and smites you there's something about that blood when that blood token is over your life that that there is no more chance and no more of ability for the Destroyer to come into your house because there's blood there and when that Destroyer sees the blood he says I can't come in here I can't dwell in this house because something special has taken place and you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy Sons forever and it shall come to pass when ye come to the land where the the Lord shall give you according as he has promised that you'll keep this service and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service you will say it is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover who passed over the houses of the children of Israel here's a token that he's that he's leaving a legacy of what happened in Egypt he's leaving this this token as a legacy of what what happens tell your children tell your grandchildren tell them if they can just apply the blood in their lives that the Destroyer can't come near and he says keep it in your mind and the people bowed their head and worshiped and the children of Israel went away and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron and it came to pass at the midnight the Lord smokee all the firstborn in the land of Egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of the cattle judgment is tough if we live our lives outside of the blood judgment is tough and Pharaoh rose up in the night and he and his servants and all the Egyptians and there was a great cry in Egypt brothers and sisters can you imagine the Wailing and the cries and the groaning and the agony of every household in Egypt every single household stepping out and crying for their firstborn son who had been lost to the death angel for there was not a house look now that there was there was nobody outside of the blood that got saved if you didn't have the blood God didn't spare you because it says there was not a house there was that there was not one dead and every single household in Egypt suffered that's right so here we see that God he was he was going to set his people uh free from being slaves into the land of Egypt and so he sends Moses and Aaron to speak to pharaoh and and and they demanded that all of God's people be set free to worship God they demanded it and they told him said we want to be set free but each time what did Pharaoh say no no get out of my presence no and so God begins to send plagues upon the land of Egypt and God begins to send these plagues to show the people that they they should worship the Creator and not the creation because Egyptians were big into Worship in the creation Sun and the Moon and and the the animals and the Beast and they had all these different gods and images they worship but God is telling them don't worship he's trying to spam he says don't worship worship the creation but worship me the Creator and God was teaching the Israelites and the Egyptian that he alone is God guess why we go back into John 14:6 and Jesus says I am the what I'm the way I'm the truth and I am the life and no man shall come unto the father except through me and that's what God was trying to tell them these plagues are to show you that I am God and you have no control in your situation so he turned watch these plagues so he turns the Nile River into blood he comes down he fills the land with frogs can you imagine mounds of frogs in and out of your house everywhere you step you're stepping on croaking frogs in and out of your house he sends gnats oh there ain't nothing that annoys me more than a natat maybe ticks but then mats you know you get that certain time of the year when you got fruit or you got apples or something there Nats you can't get rid of them gats can you imagine your whole house swarming with gats flies swarming over the people can you imagine constant and you're fighting these flies constant and these plagues keep going and going and going disease on your animals diseases on the people balls break out all over their skin and blisters no I won't let him go no I won't let him go the worst storm to ever hit Egypt passes through Locust filled the sky so that the skies looked black these are some pretty pretty big plagues right there was Darkness for three complete days what must have been going through their minds when you wake up and there's no Sunrise yeah you go to bed you wake up and there's no Sunrise you go to bed and you wake up and there's no Sunrise for three days straight Darkness across the land of Egypt and in all these plagues God was trying to give the people the opportunity to listen to him he was trying to give the people an opportunity to trust him and believe in him but as he begins and but after this plague of Darkness Pharaoh gets fed up with it and he tells Moses get out of my sight do not come and see me again for the day you do is the day you die yeah that's a bold statement when you just went through nine plagues nine plagues that change the way you live day after day after day but here we see this this 10th plague we watch this 10th plague in this 10th plague it it attacks the very heart of Egyptian faith it comes into the very very life of Egypt because Egypt they they think it's life themsel and Egyptians were obsessed with life and they wanted to keep keep the good life as long as they could keep life in Egypt intact they were ready for the next world that's why they built tombs and and and and rituals it was and and they would put all these different herbs and spices and Honeys and and they were getting prepared for the next life because they were going to step from this life into another life so life is something that they treasured in Egypt they had a lot of gods that were just Representatives yeah they didn't serve a true God but they served life in this life they could tell themselves if if we could just make it to the afterlife we're going to survive and we're going to be a continuation and we know and and we look at life itself we know life symbolized in the first born right when we have our when we get married we begin our families and you have your first born you continuing on your name life continues right life continues and so here this this is this first born it hits him hard when this Ang angel passes through the land of Egypt and passes judgment a whole entire nation is brought to his knees a whole entire nation is brought with his knees to his knees because it was God's way of saying you treasure life but I want you to know that I am the way I am the truth and I am the life the life that you treasure you would not have without me the life that you live the Glorious life you live and the things you have you would not have if not for me and he puts This Nation on their knees and he begins to down there and and after this happens they're on their knees and you say well they permitted Israel to leave no They begged Israel to leave They begged Israel to leave why was that because God proved him self in action and he proved himself in such a way that with this 10th plague that this 10 10th plague was was not only significant but it prompted the Egyptians to let the Israelites go because it revealed the spiritual nature of Salvation stay with me now it revealed what salv was the pass over and and the the consecration of the firstborn and look at this we begin to look at this and and and this both recognition of the real enemy of Israel and the Hebrew race is death and that it has to be conquered let me say this a different way God although he was judging Egypt he also let it be known to the children of Israel that death has to be conquered yeah brothers and sisters you you got a lot to be thankful for this morning we got a lot to be thankful for this morning because there was a death a burial and a resurrection that Jesus Christ became and conquered the death hell and the grave for you and I so we have to be thankful for because brother BR this way he says Christians do not die Christians do not die there's no scripture the Bible that says that Christians die he says no he says a person that lives in pleasure is dead they live in pleasure they're dead while they're living but death means separation and a separation from God he said so Christians never separate from God he said they just leave this body here to be with the Lord so death is not something to fear that's right but a not of us want to be separated from God remember we're talking about chasms we're talking about blood we're talking about things that separate us things that can draw distance between us and God and looking at this this nature of the 10th plague it was different than the other nine you say why was it so different well with the other nine uh they could just sit back and watch what was happening the children of Israel could just sit back and say man God is really putting it on Egypt God is really putting it on Egypt he's really bringing the heat down on them I wonder how they're going to squirm today I wonder when these frogs come watch them squirm watch them watch them as they squeal and these women don't like these frogs and these flies and these nets watch them squirm but now God says there's something that you got to do Israel there's an action that you've got to do there's something that's got to take place in your life children of God so you mean to tell me we can't just sit back and watch the Judgment of God on people and say oh here we are there's things in your life we got to apply the blood to there's things in my life that I have to apply the blood to you say well you saying I'm not a Christian I'm not saying you're not a Christian I'm saying you may have things in your life you need to apply the blood to you need to plunge underneath the blood of Jesus Christ amen yes so this was not merely a curse on the oppressors but and the oppressed as well you see anything in your life shortcomings failures something that's hindering you something that's taking your Victory away yeah all of those things need to be plunged under the blood I want to live a Victorious life I want every day that I wake up to say today is a Victor life how can I be victorious Jesus Christ when hardships come my way When Trials come my way Jesus Christ everything I do from the moment I wake up to the moment I get go to bed has to be through the blood of Jesus Christ if not I'm separated from God if you're not living a life that's that that is living underneath the blood of Jesus Christ on a day-to-day basis you're separated yourself from God so the Passover teaches that the real enemy is death okay and Jesus talks about it in Luke and he he begins to look at this Passover and he begins to talk about at the Last Supper and he refers the symbolism to himself and what he's going to do for the world the next day in Luke chapter 14 or Luke chapter 22 I'm sorry Luke chapter 22 and all of all of the plagues that God sent into Egypt this was by far the worst remember every animal firstborn male every child firstborn male gone and the Bible talks about the loud cry that goes all over Egypt what a sad situation you know sins and shortcomings and and hindrances they spoil them they spoil the party don't they man you can be living so good and your life can be going so so good and you're right there walking day to day to day with God and you feel like everything's good and then one little thing will pop up and you make a mistake and this boils the whole atmosphere well the rest of you angels can let me let me know how y'all handle it after after the service today but it spoils the atmosphere that we have created around us because the prophet tells us we created an atmosphere and when we're filled with the Holy Ghost it is a God ly atmosphere but when things don't go right it spoils that atmosphere but remember now God had given opportunity after opportunity for them to put trust in him but what did they do they refused and I wonder sometimes how many of us God gives us opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to overcome fears anxieties stresses hindrances disease and we refuse we're not living in a day we should be refusing God God is doing amazing things in the this last day we're living in amazing things are taking place Miracles are taking place I hear other ministers I hear other things going on where people have been healed people's been delivered and it's happening here people are being healed and people have been delivered you say well I don't see it I you're not the one living it let me tell you when you don't feel good and you pray to God and you feel better the next day God is [Applause] moving it's not the doctors it's not the medicine it's the bomb of Gil it's the blood of Jesus Christ that flows down Calvary that's giving you the healing that's giving you the overcoming [Applause] power it's God's blood that tells you I can make it it's the devil that tells you you can't God gives Moses important instructions I'd say we've been given some pretty important instructions in our last day and brother Brown tells the story he begins to tell the story of that he said the first thing you know they can they heard a a p and a roar coming through the land oh can you imagine he said they heard that uh that hum and that war he said can see the that old Priestly father walking up and down the floor this 10th plague was different this 10th plague was an attention getter this 10th plague is life or death and he said that Priestly father was pacing and walking up and down the floor just as sturdy as he could be and he said I could hear that little boy say daddy I'm the oldest in the house I'm scared I'm scared Daddy he said I I'm scared the [Applause] door don't worry the blood is on the door and he said but Daddy I've never heard a wind like that Daddy some me tell you there's times in our lives we walk in places and we say man I've never felt I've never felt so defeated and so discouraged I've never heard the wind's howl there's nothing that I hate more than a howling wind Thunder don't bother me Lightning don't bother me but I hate the wind and there there's times in our lives when the wind begins to how and he says Daddy what is that wind he said that's just the Judgment of God before they sat back and watched today they're living it that's right there was a time when we might have sat back and watch but today brothers and sisters we're living it we're living in a late hour we're living in an hour when you will see God and you'll see God's judgment upon this Earth and that's when we're getting ready to leave this place when the winds when the winds how and the rains fall we need to know that the blood is still there he said I can see this little fell say Daddy go out and take a look go out and take a look and be sure that that blood is still bear he said I can see that little boy and the girl holding hands and they go to the window and they said Daddy look here look what's coming across Egypt he said I can see those two big black wings folding back and forth and he said I see those two black wings folding back and forth and they're coming down to Egypt and he says what is that it's death he said and then I see a swo down into Egypt and then comes a scream from the house yeah he said I could see swoop down in a scream he says what was it there was no blood there it struck a house and the family is now separated he said I can see Yonder and I hear the woman run out and screaming and I'm family like this and her Elder son is dead can you imagine the women running out my child my baby my firstborn is gone and door after door after door after door is opened up and the screams B out across the land of Egypt yeah that's right and he said I can hear him say Daddy Daddy dadd Daddy go look again do you see how important it is that the blood is always applied in our life Daddy Let me see the blood today Daddy show me the blood again I need the blood today daddy and he said Here Comes those angels moving again and I see it move up and it swerves in places and it Dives down over this house and then turn back up and it says oh I see in the blood I seen the blood he he said here it comes to this home I see it and this little fell say Oh Daddy are you sure let me tell you there's a lot of things in this life I'm not sure of but one thing I am sure of is the the blood of Jesus Christ and that blood of Jesus Christ that lives in my home and in my life and in my family it will cover and take care of a multitude of sin there will be no death and no separation for me and the angel slips down to the door and spreads his wings over I see the blood and it takes flight it's seen the blood it's seen the blood boy time is rolling Abraham when Abraham was old he had to believe on God and Abraham and had to believe on God and God told him he said you need to go up there I want you to take your son Isaac and I want you to take your son Isaac and go and make a sacrifice and he said he looked down there and he told his people he said the lad and I shall return how I don't know because I'm going up to kill him hey that's a bold statement right there think about your child and Abraham says I don't know how we'll return but we'll return someway we'll be back and he sticks the knife in his belt and he said he stuck the knife in his belt and he laid the wood on Isaac's shoulders and Isaac begins to go up the hill being led by Abraham a beautiful type his son taking him up to the hill to the very altar where he would be laid on and he's packing it up the hill on his back just like God sending his son to galtha with a wooden cross on his back and he said that God spared not his own son and here's little Isaac one place I said I think the prophet said he was around 14 other place maybe a little younger at times but just imagine a 14y old who do we have as near 14 in here somebody raise your hand I know we got some somebody raise your hand 14 we got a 14y old right here how would you feel if your daddy's taking you up to the top of a mountain with a pile of wood on your back and he's got a knife in his belt because Isaac knew there had to be some some blood shed he knew enough about sacrifices that he knew some something's got to die on this Altar and here they go up into this mountain and he he knows that something's got to happen to complete this sacrifice and he's looking there and he says little Isaac said father here's the Altar and here's the fire and you got a knif but where's the sacrifice where is the sacrifice said and and Abraham looked at him and said God will provide a sacrifice and he said as he started he said he bound his son he throwed him up on the altar he pulled that knife out and he said God you gave it to me and he said he raised it up and started to pull that knife down and the angel grabbed his [Applause] hand there's something about when you need blood there's something about when there's blood needed in your life to cover something the angel of God comes and stops his hand and he says don't you touch that child Abraham I can see that you're faithful I'm going to give you the blood you love me you serve me you live for me you do everything for me and so now I give you the blood that's the life we have brothers and sisters it's the blood of Calvary it's not not on your good works it's not on your money you make it's not on your possessions but it's on you serving God and you live your life for God whether you've got failures whether you got faults whether you got things that stumble in your way God still sees you through the [Applause] blood [Music] Glory he said he he said he looked and he heard that little lamb bleeding that Ram bleeding in the thicket he said who was that lamb who let me ask you who was that lamb he said it was none other than Christ it was Christ who offered himself up for [Applause] [Music] Isaac and he called the place Jehovah Gyra I told you we're going to have a little history history March of 1822 our Mentor Ross Was Born Into Slavery on a large Plantation near Blackwater River in the Madison area of Dorchester County Maryland her childhood was not a childhood to be desired at all miny's mother was assigned to the big house and she had very little time for minty and her family and her brothers and sisters so as a child she took care of her younger brothers and the babies when she was five or six years old she was hired out as a nursaid for a woman named Susan me he was ordered to care for the baby and rock the cradle as the baby slept when the baby woke up and cried miny got a whooping five years old she later recounted the talked about this day when she said one day the baby cried so much she received lashes five different times before breakfast and she carried the scars for the rest of her life she would do things to try to get away she would try to run away for as much as five days a fivey old running away for up to five days at a time since she would wear heavy clothes and Patty clothes to try to protect herself from the lashes that she would get as she fought back also in her childhood she was sent to work for a planner and this guy she had to go out and check his muskrat traps in the marshes as a child going through the marshes of Maryland checking traps and as she walked through there she began to get sick and she come down with measles they wouldn't let her stop measles is a serious sickness and so here she is now tra traing through the woods checking traps with with measles until almost to the point of death I sent her back to her mama and said take care of her they left her there to sit there to basically a die she becomes so ill but then again her mama be to nurse her back and prayed over her and give herself and she lay in it over her and raised her back up to health but no no no longer was she she well and healthy that that she was hired out again she spoke about how homesick she was as a child she Grew Older she grew stronger she was then assigned to the field and the forest where she would Drive Oxen all day or plow the fields or haul logs and Timber in and out of the woods at an as an adolescent she suffered a severe head injury she suffered a severe head injury when the overseer of the slaves took a twb piece of metal and threw it at a fleeing slave and HD her her in the head by accident it says she she later said it broke my skull there she laid bleeding and unconscious she was returned to the to the house the enslaver house where she laid on the seat of a little couch or a little cot where she remained without medical care for two days Broken Skull blood flowing you say where you going this I've got a place after this incident she began to experience extremely painful headaches she began to have seizures and fall unconscious she was fall unconscious but it she claimed to be aware of all of her surroundings as she appeared to be sleeping and this condition remained with her for the rest of her life so after this injury mty began to experience visions and vivid dreams which he and interpreted as the revelations from God she began to see these spiritual experiences and had a had a profound effect on her personality and and and the passion that she had for the faith in God and although she was a literate she was told Bible stories by her mother she was told Bible stories by her mother and and she attended a Methodist Church and she found she found guidance in the Old Testament Tales of Deliverance she found encouragement in the relig stories of Moses and the Deliverance of the children of Israel and that the blood being applied and the token applied and she found she found some some encouragement in these words you see if anybody could say there was a Chasm a distance between themselves and God you want to talk about a lonely feeling think about that childhood think about you mothers think about that being your child but yet she found consulant she found cons consoling and Sav in the word of God sometime in October of 1851 miny made her escape and I love to hear about the the old stories like this and the documentaries and she stood in the woods to alert her family and friends of what she was doing and as she stood in the word in the in the in the woods she began to sing songs we call them Negro spirituals but they were more than just church songs they were road maps they were destinations they was goals accomplishments and right when she got ready to run away she she found herself in the woods and she said I will meet you in the morning and they could hear this echoing out of the woods and the next thing she said I'm Bound for the promised land and they begin to put this two songs together and they begin to hear and they begin to realize she's leaving she's fixing to give up this life of bondage she's going to make a run for it she's going to where there's a land of Freedom where there's a land of liberty she's going to the promised land the land that she's heard about and read about and stories been told over and over brothers and sisters we're headed for a land we're heading for a land where there be no more bondage thank that's right and if you've ever been in any [Applause] bondage you know what freedom feels like you know what freedom feels like after she made her Escape she changed her name and she changed the name may be more familiar with her name was Harriet Tubman her name was Harriet Tubman the route that she took on uh is UN it was unknown for years how she made the Escape into the Underground Railroad and she would go uh as she be to fight 90 miles on a track by herself you see sometimes things ain't always easy we got the blood but sometimes we got to fight there was a Chasm between her and freedom there was bondage and freedom and there was a place that she had to get the Gap out from in between yeah she be to go and she be to go 90 miles and it would take her uh five days to three weeks can you imagine as she run through the marshes and through the woods and the hounds following her how many of you's ever had the hounds of Hell after you she traveled a night and she said the only way I knew where to go is I followed the North Star are you with me she was illiterate she didn't have no education she couldn't read she couldn't write she didn't know her name if you showed it to her but she knew if she could follow that North Star that the north star that she had heard about her whole life would guide her to a place of freedom and she followed that North Star so that and she followed and went at night so that the fugitives or the ones who were collecting rewards couldn't catch her yeah one of her particular Journeys she began to go through the route this was on her first journey she come to a place that there was a neighborly type person a family they were against the slavery and they could hear the they could hear the hounds they could hear the the the people coming the the to come and pull them back into slavery and they told they said you grab a broom and you sweep the porch like you were here you grab a broom and you sweep the porch until they leave they looked all over for miny they all over for her couldn't find her and later that evening they they took and they tucked her into a wagon and covered her over into the wagon and she began to journey and they get they let her out and give her to the next person and handed her off to the next person who cared and as she goes down through here she said when she comes she recalled the experience of what it felt like when she crossed over into p Pennsylvania and she felt the experience a feeling of relief and awe and she said when I crossed over that line I looked at my hands to see if I was still the same person Lord can you imagine brothers and sisters oh there's coming a day when we'll cross over we'll get so close that we'll look at our hands and our hands will look new we look at our feet and they may be doing some dancing too because we are coming to day of Freedom Deliverance by the blood of Jesus Christ she saids the do you have time for some more after reaching Philadelphia Harriet said she's thinking of her family she said I was a Stranger in a Strange Land she said and she said but now I'm free and they should be free you know there's something about when you become to Christ and you've got that blood that's been applied to your life there's something about it that you just say man I want them to have the same blood that I've got I want them to have the same Deliverance that I've got I want them to be free just like me and she thought about it she said I'm going back for my family and the guy the head over the Underground Railroad he said you can't go you can't go har it because you are illiterate and you can't read the road signs you don't know which direction to go and she said don't you tell me what I can and what I can't do she said because I may not be able to read because God tells me where to go God leads me God directs me don't tell me what I can and can't do and she said she was going on this journey they discouraged her to take this journey she loaded up her bags she began to head back to Maryland to guide the rest of the family away and from 19 or 1851 to 1862 she returned repeatedly to the eastern shore of Maryland she brought back 70 slaves in 13 Expeditions she gave Specific Instructions to 50 or 60 more on how to get there you know what they nicknamed her Moses the the slave owners couldn't figure out who is taking all these slaves who is running off with our slaves how are we going to catch this person they said it's like Moses he sing he she would dress like a man said he sings the songs of Israel he she sings the songs of Deliverance of Moses amen so anytime they said Moses is coming how many people you think I'm out of the houses it's going home time Jesus is coming it's going home time by the late 1850s the slave owners held a public meeting and they wanted to to put an end to this Moses little did they know that there was a a little lady by the nickname of minty who stood about 5T tall petite 5 feet tall and she's the one responsible for freeing all these slaves and taking them 90 miles away they wanted her so bad I want you to listen to this stag green number they offered a $40,000 reward for her death that's equivalent to $1.3 million today one do you know how much money that is 1.3 million she said I never run my train off track and I never lost a passenger you think man that's that's something they are play a key role in the the release of people in the when the when the Civil War took place she became a spy for the Union Army she became one of the only women to lead a armed battle against a an opponent she began to tell them exactly what was going she sent word to the slaves back in Maryland I believe it was that that they were going to come that the union was going to come and that they as they begin to come be listening for the sound sounds of the ships be listening for the whistles and when she begin to begin to tell them and they come up on the on the on the shore there they begin to sound the whistles and they stand there looking and all of a sudden she sees a a fleeing slavery Stampede coming towards her the Stampede of slaves is being chased by the Confederate soldiers and they're being chased and at that time the union all Point points their guns and she says she she tells the scene and she said it was a scene of chaos women they was carrying their stilling and running for everything that they could get taking everything they had with them they she said that the parents would have slings around their necks and babies 750 delivered that day 750 delivered in one day you see Harriet Tubman couldn't she couldn't help where she was born she couldn't help that she was born into slavery she couldn't help the life that she had been given she had no control over that in her life but one thing she knew that she could just cross that 90 miles of wilderness that there was a pardon waiting for her on the other side and and and freedom could be had and a new life could be lived a life of happiness and joy and peace and a life with God on her side that he could not fail let me tell you this morning brothers and sisters you may not have control over the situation in your life you may not can help who you were born to you may not can help where you were raised or how you were raised but one thing I can tell you is if you've got God on your side and the blood of Jesus Christ you cannot fail all the devil's going to tell you that you can't they try to tell her you can't because you're this or this this and that's what the devil does in our lives he says you can't make it you can't overcome you've got this in your life you've got that in your life look him in the face and say don't you tell me what I can and can't do devil don't you tell me what I can and can't do because I've got God on my [Laughter] [Applause] side that's right brother Brown said that there's something that you didn't have control over too I want you to listen to this he said my sins was something I couldn't help oh my my sins was something I couldn't help he said I was born into it he said I was born with Adam's nature in me but somebody pardoned me he said somebody paron me he said they rubbed that old account away one day and I was free from that day on he said but there's something about when man crosses that Chasm and they let that get between them and God he separated from God so brothers and sisters in your life think about your life today what is separating you from God what is the what is growing the distance between you and God not I hope it's something is short in the distance but if you've got something in your life fear do you let fear push you farther away from God you're getting quiet on me we're striking some striking some nerves here do we let doubt push us farther away from God do we let our unbelief push us further away from God do we allow anger to push us farther away from God I'm not saying you're not Christians I'm not saying you're not saved but it goes back to what I said earlier are there things in your life you need to plunge under the blood you can be a Christian you can serve God with all your heart but if you're you're allowing fear and anxieties and and doubts and anger and jealousy and mischief to keep you and hinder you from a full Victorious Life With God plunge it under the blood close that Chasm I'm gonna have to hurry I'm G have to skip some Winston Church Hill he became Britain's prime minister on May the 10th 1940 and he later wrote he later wrote that I felt that all my past life had been but a preparation for this hour and for this trial I thought my goodness a man who practically fought Hitler Toe to Toe and we think we've got trials on that very day that he was elected to fulfill his life's ambition Germany that morning had invaded France Belgium the Netherlands Luxembourg Britain had faced its Supreme test and it's his leadership through this F uh through through the 40 and 41 you can look in and study the Battle of Dunkirk and you'll see that that's where Church Hill is best remembered right in this area here but what did he do what did he do so so great he knew how to rally the troops it said that his word was the greatest weapon that he had in a conference in in the message conference with God brother Brown said it was a conference because of World War II it was almost getting out of hands I want you to listen to how important Church Hill was brother R said they had to get together and put all their strategy together to work out something Mr Churchill and Roosevelt and the others they was trying to pull their senses together to pull it to it and to find out what was best because it was a crucial moment listen now it was a time when the whole free world would have blown up and Hitler today would have been a dictator of the whole world and we would not be having this meeting today you and I would be speaking German that's right there would be no America yeah that's right now well you got to be thankful for thank you Lord you would find yourself on one side or the other you'd find yourself supporting uh the old Germany or you find yourself supporting the Nazi party yeah the church here got together and Church Hill begin to talk and he begin to inspir he began to get there and he begin to talk and he got out there listen to what he says he says we shall go on to the end even though large tracks of Europe and many of those old famous States had fallen or may fall into the grip of the gestapo and the odorus apparatus of the Nazi rule we shall not flag or fail we got to come to a place where we speak as that and say I don't care what Satan throws at me we will not flag we will not fail we will not tuck tail and run but we're going to stand and fight this battle he said we shall go on the end we shall fight in France we shall fight in the seas and the oceans we will fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our Island whatever the cost may be whatever the cost may be here on this Earth fight for what God has given you apply the blood and move forward he said we'll fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender and even if which I do not now for a moment believe this island or a large part of it will be sub subjugated and starving then our Empire Beyond the Seas armed and guarded by the British Fleet would carry on the struggle until God's good time the new world and all its power and might step forth to rescue and the liberation of the old that's the blood of Jesus Christ in our lives it's the liberation of the old it's the old you it's the old ways it's the old feelings the old doubts the har drums but the blood of Jesus Christ is The Liberation in your life that makes you say I'm a new man I'm a New Creation in another one and I'm hurrying now in another time he began to speak and this was in 41 the wars in Full Steam you know we didn't join it till the very end we wasn't real helpful till the very end and he begged us to come and he pleaded with us come and help enter the war help us fight this man stood in the gap between bondage and freedom and he stood there and he began to speak at at his uh Alma Mar and he began to speak there and he says you cannot tell from appearances how things will go a situation in your life you don't know how to go why because God's in control he says we can't tell by our appearances how things will go sometimes imagination makes things far worse than they are how many times has the devil done that to you you think you can't make it you think you're going to fail you think you're going broke your family's in the gutter yeah he's playing on your imaginations boo devil he said yet without imagination not much can be done those people who are imaginative see many more dangers than perhaps exist he said but they also must pray to be given that extra Courage the imagination begins to play on you find the extra courage he says and pray Lord and pray he says for everyone surely we have gone through this I'm dressing myself to this school never never never never larger Petty never give in except to convictions of honor and never give in never give in to the things that Satan puts at me but I'm I will only give into the things that bring good honor and courage and glory to you Jesus you may find yourself this morning a slave to a habit or desire or a slave to fear and you just can't break it away but today today is a day of Escape today is a day of Escape today can be your day of vict no longer scared to but full of Courage no more defeated but Victorious no more sick but healed no more bound but delivered stand with me this morning give God praise you see there's been a Chasm there may have been a chasm in your life and you may be feeling all these different emotions and feelings but let me tell you that Chasm was bridged today by the blood of Jesus Christ and if you want all the good things of God apply the blood if you want all the things that in this morning the Blood Bought reward is yours today let's pray Heavenly Father we

verbage it would reach the hearts of the people Lord that they will find courage and they will find overcoming they will find Freedom and deliverance and knowing that that only way we can accomplish these in our life is through the blood of Jesus Christ if there's anybody this morning that says I've got just a little something in my life Brother Brad I'm a Christian and I serve God and I love God but I got just this little thing that just it's just like a thorn in My Flesh and it plagues me if you just want to raise your hand defy gravity and tell God God I'm lifting this up to you to be placed under the blood of Calvary God bless those hands that hand those hands all over the building If we're honest with ourselves we've all got a little something that we would like God to just remove from our lives something that we'd like to be strengthened in an area that we're weak in we're just being honest Christian human beings this morning but with that Honesty comes a dependability that you can overcome yes thank you Lord for your blood the blood that was shed on Calvary we love you Lord with all of our hearts and thank you Lord Jesus for our freedoms as we've approached this
