almighty God lord we just accept those things now and look to your word ask that you're blessed in Jesus name amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles with you we're gonna read one scripture in the in the book of Jude the third verse and then we're going to look over into Deuteronomy for another scripture reading amen we're going to speak to you for for a bit today on on Defenders of the landmarks Defenders of the landmarks hey man I believe that we had a mighty conqueror that came and and stood for us and fought for us and now I believe there's going to be a people that will stand for him and fight for him in this day amen and and fight for truth and stand for truth wherever that battle may take us we believe Lord Lord that he's going to go before us and the Book of Jude the third chapter says beloved when I gave all dude all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints we're also going to look over in Deuteronomy 19 and the 14th verse you'll see as we go through today that is as I laid before the Lord last night and looked at different things that it ended up coming back into the same channel some of the same similar thoughts as we dealt with last night Deuteronomy 19 and the 14th verse says Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark which day of old time have set in thine inheritance which Thou shalt inherit in the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it also in chapter 27 17 it says this cursed be the man that remove his neighbor's landmark and all the people shall say amen amen you may have your seats this morning pray that the Lord will add His blessings to the reading of the of the word look at that again verse 17 curse it be he that removeth his neighbor's Landmark brother Branham says that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get lacks I mean I think it's very important that today that we we check up ourselves and make sure that there's no laxeness in US make sure that those that we haven't relaxed amen looking back at Jude verse 3 we're instructed to contend for the faith that was once delivered the way this was would word it here show shows us that the relaxing or the slide that took place in the very first church age has already started they've already begun to slide a bit and and we know that this age means that the the word Ephesus means aimed at but relaxed amen because we know it's already happening because Jude is pointing back already saying that we got to contend for the faith that was once delivered in other words he's recognizing that things have changed and he's pointing back even though they've only it's only been a few years from the inauguration of the church it's only been a few years since the day of Pentecost he's already saying we've got to contend for how things were once delivered amen and and contend here the word means to strive or by in contest or against difficulties now brother Brandon would tell us that the only way to know what faith we are to contend for is to look back at what Jude was talking about and look at the faith that Jude was told talking about and then that and that we could gain instruction on what it is we are to contend for now this is only brother Brown would tell us this is only 33 years after Pentecost and Jude here he's a Christian so he's not pointing back to some levitical law he's not saying we got to get back to the Old Testament he's not pointing all the way back to that he's pointing back to the day of Pentecost brother Branham says he's pointing back to the inauguration of the church on the day of Pentecost he says this now if we can find out what kind of Faith now remember this is just 33 years after the inauguration of the church at Pentecost 33 years later there has been such a falling away until Jude here under the inspiration of the holy spirit is sending the letter to the churches to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he says now if we can only find out what kind of Faith the first Saints had then we can find out what kind under faith we are to contend for amen listen there's a lot of people willing to contend there's a lot of people even in the nominal world that are willing to contend for their faith they're willing to stand up for what they believe in and then there's many that aren't afraid to stand but they don't know what kind of faith it is that they're supposed to be contending for amen and that they may have Parts they may have truths and they are contending for for what they know but they are not contending for the faith that was once delivered amen and that's what we want to contend for today is for the faith that was once delivered brother Brown says we must remember what kind of Faith was it now listen closely we want to bring this down early on in our in our subject today let's just think about it oh well the first thing a person ought to do is think of the first subject the first thing is we must repent the disciples taught repentance water baptism Divine Healing resurrection of the Dead manifestation of the power of the Holy Holy Ghost signs and wonders spoke with tongues interpreted tongues cast out Devils healed the sick open the blinded eyes saw Visions is that right well this is 1900 years later and we're still contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and God is confirming it he says amen he says now he also promised that there would be a restoring of the faith Hallelujah he says we read over in Jude that Jude said earnestly content for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now we are promised in Malachi 4 by the same system he always did that we would be restored back to the original Faith oh my back to the original seed back to the seed like it began on the day of Pentecost back to the same Doctrine word by word Power by power Spirit by the same thing just exactly like it was back in the beginning through signs and wonders of the living presence of Jesus Christ listen I say like Moses and the people it's the presence of the Lord doesn't go before us don't send me I gotta have his presence I gotta see it moving I gotta have it today more than I did yesterday you're not gonna make it out of this world without his presence you're not gonna make it out of this world without the faith that was once delivered on to the Saints I say Lord I need your presence Lord others may not need it but I need it today I need it moving in my life I need it moving in my home I need it moving in our church services amen amen we're not contending for a dead letter well we're not contending for just correct Doctrine although we should but that's not all it is we're not just contending for correct Doctrine but we're to contend for the faith exactly how it was delivered in the first age brother Brandon would tell us over and over again that if that vine ever put forth another branch that it would write another book of Acts behind it amen another book of Acts where demons are subject to the word of God where demons are cast out we're the sick are healed where people are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what I'm looking for today is another book of Acts listen it's already been written it's in the word but what about your chapter what about the chapter that tells about your life what about the chapter that tells about your victories that's another book of Acts because it's going to tell a brother Matt mccard and his victories it's going to tell of other brothers and their pictures and how they overcame but how's it going to happen by the same faith that was once delivered unto the Saints amen that's what we're contending for as Believers today we're contending that he is the same yesterday today and forever how many will contend for that that he is the same we're contending that our God still heals you got a sickness in your body today our God still heals the same as he always has you got a spirit of Affliction in your body our God is the same deliverer that he's always been we're contending that our God still moves and services we're contending for freedom of worship we're contending that that is still an act to Upper Room experience that is yours to have amen we're contending today and the reason that we have to contend is because there is a spirit that opposes that faith there is a spirit that's been there from the very beginning and it's come as in and it comes to rob that Faith No it's not just going to rob any faith it doesn't mind listen the devil don't mind you coming to church he doesn't mind that if nothing ever moves and nothing ever changes and it's just a ritual and it's cold and formal he doesn't care listen the devil don't miss church right he's here every service so he don't mind you coming to church he mind you getting that life spring of Living Water he mind you coming in contact with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he mines when your life is going to get changed and so he tries to rob that out of our services and out of our homes and out of our experiences brother Brown says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it how how is it going to defile the church making it lukewarm formal and Powerless now listen it's a very subtle Spirit he doesn't run up here and go hey I'm the devil I want you to be formal I want you to be no no it's a very it's a very subtle Spirit sometimes it'll use quotes sometimes they'll use scriptures and it'll come and it'll come in in a way and it'll attack the faith and it'll try to drain the life out of the church and it'll be so close that it'll deceive the very elect if possible if possible if possible listen some people read that and they get a little bit shook up oh it's going to be so close it's gonna that's not the part I focus on I focus I focus on the fact that we're not going to be deceived we can't be deceived it is possible it's possible but it's not possible today the elect will not be deceived oh that scripture doesn't worry me now that scripture excites me it's going to be close but I'm gonna overcome it's gonna be close but we're going to make it through it's going to be close but we will not be deceived we're predestinated not to be Hallelujah it's not a scary thought but there is a bribe that will recognize and withstand the Antichrist spirit in this day withstand the Antichrist Spirit but overcome the Antichrist Spirit there's gonna be a bride on this Earth turn back to the faith the faith that we're to be continuing for turned back by Malachi 4 she's going to be found not only turned back to it but producing the same Works operating in the same power that that Faith produced there in the book of Acts amen amen listen this ride will by no means be a lukewarm there is going to be life in this bride there is going to be overcoming power in this ride there is going to be healing there is gonna be Deliverance there is going to be salvation there is going to be holy ghost out points oh come on I say this morning could be one I say Lord pour it out this morning we don't gotta wait it don't got to be a certain time right now there are gonna be holy ghost outpourings that is going to produce overcoming lives listen I'm all about the emotion you've probably figured that out by now I'm about to jump and I'm about to shout and I'm about all those things but at the end of it it will produce an overcoming Victorious Life That's what I'm looking for get excited I'm excited you can jump you can shout you can run around this building I might take a lap with you but when you walk out this door Square your shoulders back and say I'm an overcomer I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ like that cat that fell in the wall where's that devil at now I'll give him no rest I will not allow him to enjoy one day in his eating because this will produce overcoming lives Hallelujah there will be a bride and she will be found defending the face fighting for the faith standing for truth brother Brandon tells us that what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right he says originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that is our inalienable right you have a right to those things you have are we supposed to go seeking after nope there to come following after signs and wonders shall follow those that believe so many times when they aren't there when the gifts are completely absent when the moving of the spirit is completely absent non-existent I go how much do we believe because the word of God says they will follow the Believers amen do we believe that today identifying and and defending the landmarks allows us to contend uh as Jude commanded for the faith that was once delivered because we can recognize what it is we're to continue Amen to get our focus in the faith is an established Faith listen this isn't our faith isn't wishy-washy changing here and changing there the way the standards of the worlds do but it is an established Faith with set boundaries and clear definitions and clear standards well-defined landmarks you know how it is when you have property you want your landmarks well-defined so there's no debate over what's yours and what's the neighbors and whether or not this is on your land or not your landmarks are well-defined that's exactly how this gospel is the landmarks are clear it's well defined as it's not up for debate they're well-defined landmarks and landmarks an important part of the land that we have been restored to in this day because landmarks indicate boundaries they indicate ownership come on somebody it indicates what belongs to you it indicates where you will be blessed listen landmarks not only tell you what belongs to you and where you'll be blessed but it also tells you where not to go it tells you where not to stray to listen don't go down to Egypt looking for your blessings don't go out in the world looking for your blessings God has given us a land God has returned us to the land here's where you'll be blessed here's where you'll overcome stay in your land stay in your land stay within the boundaries but within those boundaries possess all everything within those boundaries inside those landmarks belong to you today amen you're not going to be blessed outside of the land that God has given you you're not going to be blessed pursuing things outside of the will of God I don't care how good that job looks I don't care how pretty you think that girl is or how handsome that fella is if it's not God's will you don't want it you will not be blessed outside of God's will you take a job that keeps you out of the house of God all the time you're not gonna find true blessings there you marry a girl or marry a boy who ain't sold out and filled with the Holy Spirit you're not gonna find true blessings there I don't know why we're there but here we are you seek God's will you seek the kingdom of God's first and then all these things will be added under you you want a happy home you want a blessed life you want children that serve the Lord seek the will of God first set your boundaries and live inside those boundaries amen [Music] stay where God said stay and possess what God Said to possess but then once you possess it you better be prepared to defend it be prepared to defend your possession because there's going to be those that come and say no that ain't yours not the land's right here no no that was for another age no you can't have that the days of Miracles pass that don't belong to you no more come on now all the gifts of the Spirit they're not needed anymore you can't have those things hey somebody to go so far as to tell you the days the salvation's over that there is no more intercession and I said there's got to be somebody willing to stand up and say no I still need it I still need the blood I still need Mercy I still need Grace I still need healing I know he still healed my home still needs Grace my children still need the Holy Ghost they have a right to the experience the same way you had an experience I'm gonna stand up and defend the landmarks of the word I'm not giving nothing back I'm not backing up off of anything he said I could have it he said it was mine so your opinion on the matter is no it is void it doesn't matter I can have the Holy Ghost I can have joy I can have peace I can have Victory because it's a landmark of the word of God Hallelujah the word says those things are mine we might as well come on out of this the word says those belong to me I don't have to back up if the word says this is the final say right here there's a lot of people down through the years that have a lot of opinions but this is the final say this right here is what matters I'm not I'm not going to give up my worship I'm not going to give up my praise I'm not going to give up the anointing that is coming this day it's the anointing that breaks the Yoke that's in the word I believe we can still have Services where the power of God's poured out I'm still gonna lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I'm still gonna have altar calls and see people come and week their way to Calvary because that's the way it was at the original I'm not afraid of those things because they're promised they belong to us Hallelujah Brother Brad I'm here see I'm saying we believe in being converted we believe in sin accepting Jesus Christ as personal savior we believe him as the Son of God yes sir that's all right all those things you had a form of godliness but deny the power thereof when I say what do you think about Divine Healing praising the Lord shouting all the Miracles and signs and Gifts back in the church oh that was for another age just exactly what the Holy Ghost said would take place the Holy Ghost said they'll have a form of godliness but will deny the power thereof he said from such turn away for this is just like Janice and jambres that withstood Moses and we dealt with that last night why did Janice and jamborees want them to look at that as nothing more than emotion as nothing more than a magician's trick because if he could get them to doubt in that power the power that was going to deliver them the power that was going to take them homeless we believe for a Rapture absolutely and I believe for a body change absolutely then I believe that the power of God can fall into service and cause someone to speak in tongues and then cause it to be interpreted cause people to be delivered from depression delivered from anxiety cause people to be healed how are we gonna believe that this body can be changed how about a deposit on that tonight how about a down payment on that tonight Lord just once more pour yourself out in our lives I need another drink from the rock this morning he's the same God hallelujah landmarks were not to be moved if the word established something it is always established it's not up for debate because of certain certain Church don't see it that way I don't care if it's my church I don't care if it's me if I tell you something that's contrary to this you tell me to shut up it's right here it doesn't matter if it hurts somebody's feelings if it's in the word it doesn't matter it's not up for debate because it's no longer acceptable in society [Applause] come on now Proverbs 22 and 28 says remove not the ancient Landmark which not others have sent the Pentecostal father sent some ancient landmarks to church it was set up exactly the way God wanted he's telling you don't move the landmarks they've been sent how I want them set the landmarks or the boundaries don't change from one generation to the next the Next Generation didn't get to the side you know what I think I would rather have that and then go move landmarks now they'll try they'll try to young people they'll even I mean kids are kids they'll try to push the boundaries so to speak they'll try to find out how sure those boundaries are come on let's don't have that rebellious teenage spirit in our lives as Christians today always trying to push the boundaries of what God has set for us now this don't really matter and that don't really matter will I really go to hell if I do this listen if we'll quit looking at it versus in a way of will it send me a hell and start looking at it in a way of does displease God we'll get a lot further down the road does this please my lord does this please my Lord not will he send me the hell for it not as this bad is this okay but does this please God it's what I'm feeding on right now pleasing the Lord Jesus start looking at it through that filter but the Next Generation don't get to decide where the boundaries lay and neither do we as it relates to the word of God they were established in the unchanging infallible word of the Lord his boundaries do not drift or change from one generation to the next if it was wrong in 1700 it's wrong to death if it was wrong in 1963 or 1965 it's still wrong today if the Bible says You must be born again you must be born again there's no other way around it and he laid a pattern out for how you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost and if being filled with the Holy Ghost in the book of Acts calls signs and wonders and tongues and all other kinds of manifestations of the spirit it's gonna do the same thing today absolutely it's always going to be that way and he says curse it be the man who would move the landmark curse it be the man who moves The Landmark because heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away what are we talking about defending the landmarks people that are willing to stand there no matter what happens is that won't back off this because the landmarks we know this in society are Ever Changing the boundaries in society are Ever Changing we can't allow ourselves to get in that frame of mind to where principles and standards become fluid sure they change depending on the day or the change according listen we can't ever get comfortable here you should never be comfortable with a Christian's life go so against the flow of the world it's flowing that way and if you relax even for a minute what happens when you throw something in a flowing stream it goes with the current as Christians we can't relax today there has to be a constant struggle a constant battle against the current against the evil against lukewarmness against the gods of this evening it's a constant fight but we're constantly gaining ground we ain't backing up we're not going with the current we're not getting comfortable we say no these standards are Eternal standards these left and marks are Eternal landmarks and I will stand for them today your life should go completely contrary to the flow of the world if you listen if you look around today and you're going the same way as your friends at school or you're joking and talking the same way as your friends at work you might want to check up this morning you might want to say Lord is there so I ain't saying you're some kind of right sinner but if it's just easy for you to blend right in if it's just easy for you to go with the flow as it were something's not right because your life should always be going contrary to the flow of this world Amen you should be having to swim hard against the current to get anywhere constantly fighting for ground constantly gaining ground but finding no bite the dove that Noah let out finding no place for you to rest finding no place for your feet to rest the only place you should have rest while you're here is on the word of God the only place we find rest is that rock and when we get that rock all of a sudden that anchor digs in deep to that rock and then let the winds blow let the waters come let the floods come I'll make her to the solid rock it doesn't move it doesn't change it'll hold when the storms blow it'll hold when others walk away it'll hold when sickness strikes it'll hold when everybody else turns negative it'll hold it's unchanging it's the rock of Jesus Christ get anchored in that today you'll quit blowing back and forth anchor in a solid rock this morning Hallelujah this rock isn't influenced by The Winds of the world you know for many years the landmarks of society stayed mostly unmoved they stayed mostly stable and because of that it created a relatively stable world for people to live in for hundreds of years if if not thousands and even our country that that we live in there was a time it looked to God we can't say that anymore but there was a time it looked to God and because of that it reaped the benefits of that it was a blessed country and God's word was a basis for the landmarks of our society listen marriage was a landmark of society and marriage was glorified and it was lifted up instead of just living together and having children out of wedlock but when you move a landmark of God it comes with consequences you can't move a landmark without the consequences that follow 75 percent of long-term Correctional Facility inmates are from father absent households 85 percent of kids who exhibit behavioral disorders are from fatherless homes 85 percent of kids in state institutions are from fatherless homes what brother Brown tell us tell us he said it's not it's not teenage delinquency it's parental delinquency listen and you see that a lot of times even in message homes listen I I I understand we're called to be providers daddies we're called to work but when you put yourself so much in your work and so much time in your work and so much time in this and so much time in this project so much time in that project to the point that you're neglecting your children listen they don't need a new pair of Nikes they don't need new airpods they don't need a new PlayStation whatever it is you're trying to get them they need you they need a leader they need a daddy they need somebody present that's there to love them and guide them and keep them from The Wiles of the devil amen I like I said I believe in providing but what they need is you in their life that's what they need Parenthood used to be a landmark of society but now we March in the streets to Kill The Unborn I say that the boundary stones have been moved a little bit truth used to be valued and now there's no truth hardly to be found in the world or poison with constant political propaganda as I've heard it said before if you if you don't read the news you're uninformed if you do read the news you're misinformed there's no truth to be had out there then why are we looking for truth out there there's no truth in schools there's no truth in government there's no truth in politics well I don't know what to believe yes you do know what to believe it makes it easier to know what to believe here's the truth you're looking for here's the life you're looking for it's easier now to know what to believe than ever before because it's got so wicked so off base that it makes this shine brighter than it's ever shown before oh it's getting darker brother Aaron yep and the light is shining brighter than it's ever shine in this day we know what to believe the landmark of morality has been torn down replaced with the pursuit of lust replaced with the pursuit of personal satisfaction American universities were once actually founded on Christian ideas think of that they've completely moved their landmarks it used to be the place of Christian morals at one time they were literally considered the center of Christian thought in our country but now the boundary stones of the university has been moved so far off towards just in a pit of atheism tourists is nothing but an indoctrination Center for our youth listen I'm not I'm not telling you that I'm against you going to college but you better know where you stand before you get in that Cesspool you better know where you stand before you get there and get surrounded by all those ideas and all that intellectualism you better get there because I'm telling you like a professor told me one time in class what we have learned is that the more educated we get people the more liberal they become know where you stand allowing the boundary stones to be moved has allowed the whole world to go completely insane like we said no truth in government no truth is gonna listen they pulled up the anchor they pulled out the anchor they got away from the absolute and in so doing the Winds of Change has taken them so far out of the picture that the world has gone completely insane a hundred years ago you could have never convinced people of where we'd be at today 50 years ago you could have never convinced the world where we be at today but God knew and a prophet knew a puff into the property God said let me prophesy something to you just before it comes to pass the whole world is groping in insanity and it will get worse and worse and worse until there'll be a bunch of maniacs and it's almost that way now I said it last night fulfilled I know that's why we can't give even an inch that's why we can't give even a foothold sometimes like well why does this matter why does that matter we can't move the boundaries don't because listen he's not just after your joy he's not just after your peace that's not what he's after he's after your soul he's after your life he's after your eternity and he wants to take it all and it starts by giving up just a little moving the the the the landmark just a little we can't give in we can't back up we can't give an inch this morning the devil says oh but this is so small how many times I know as a kid especially I've said things like why does that matter why is that such a big deal why is that so important that seems so old-fashioned listen I didn't put the landmark there I didn't put the boundaries down there God put it there and I believe that if he put it there he knew why he put it there he had a reason for putting it there why were the laws of Israel so strict why were they so strict go back and look and study a little bit of the histories of the other Pagan cultures to where so much of their religion and their entire life revolved around sexual things even with children so God understanding there would have never been a virgin for him to be born through right had he not come down and said landmarks boundary stones and make it so wrong that if you commit adultery do these things you will be killed why he knew what he was doing he knows how to work things out one word is a big deal ask Eve listen if you think little things don't matter get a kidney stone one time that put me straight to hospital little things matter little things can hurt little things matter one word stepping out from behind that one word cause the entire trouble that we're in today I say we gotta defend every word of God we got to stand for every word of God we gotta Square our shoulders back put on the whole armor and say here I stand today I woke back up this word is truth this message is truth this message is indicated it's the only Vindicated voice in this day it's worth standing for it's worth fighting for and if need be it is worth dying for because it's the only place where true life is in this day Hallelujah we have to contend Satan never relaxes he never stops attacking he wants to destroy this bride he wants to see you so bad lukewarm he wants to see you so bad lifeless and Powerless he wants to come in and in subtle ways and Rob us of our freedom lot robots of the life that we've been restored to I say no not today not today Satan that's become a slogan out there I see it on shirts and cups today not today listen I'll say it again not today Satan I'll Stand and Fight For Joy I'll Stand For Peace I'll fight for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll fight for everything now every Redemptive promise that was restored to us that day on Calvary I will stand as long as there's breath in my body I'll Stand and fight boy he died for it how dare I say it don't matter he died for it how dare say I don't need that he died for it so that you would be equipped just stand in this evil day if he died for it I say I want it I'll take it I'll fight for it I'll draw my sword this morning and say back off just be long to me hallelujah it's mine the Holy Ghost is mine my children are mine victory is mine Hallelujah I'm not backing up today forward all my Christian Soldier take more ground take more ground you're called to take more ground today Hallelujah he said there'd be gifts in the church I'll fight for it if he said be filled with the Holy Ghost I'll fight for it John 14 12 he said the works that I do shall you do also I'll fight for it you know if you'll study the message when brother Branham goes and sometimes he'll he'll list or quote end time scriptures he'll say Luke 17 30. Revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 almost all the time he'll also say John 14 12. he makes that an end time scripture he puts it there all the time The Works that I do shall you do also and greater and greater the greater portion of John 14 12 was found in the third poor how could we do greater without the fullness how could you do greater without it being restored in this day you're a third pool people quit being afraid to operate in it you're being afraid to take the word upon your mouth and put on your lips he said that's the same as deity speaking well I don't know about that I do the prophet said it y'all how we gonna believe everything else and go I don't know about that it's time we step into our position step into our Authority step into the place God called us to step into he didn't call us to be church members he didn't send a message to produce a new religion he sent a new message to produce Jesus Christ on earth once again in a broad body manifesting The Works of Jesus he's coming back who's he coming back for Miss Jesus Christ bone in this bone flesh of his flesh power is power she is him [Applause] manifesting Jesus on the Earth again that's why the message was sent not so you could win an argument have a better Doctrine than somebody he's not coming back to Rapture doctrines he's coming back to Rapture men and women who has flesh around those quotes flash around those scriptures flesh a flesh body that's what he's coming back for but that flesh is indwelt by his spirit amen Jude says contend Hosea 5 and 10 says the princes of Judah were like them that removed the bound therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water the bound here is the boundary and it says they are like those that remove the bound or the ancient landmarks God gave them his law to be offense about his own property but they have sacritiously broken through it and set it aside so there are those who will move the landmarks which means there have to be those willing to defend the landmarks there's got to be somebody willing that'll stand and say as long as I'm here this belongs to the bride as long as I'm here and this is in the word listen we look back to where Jude was writing in 66 A.D so we know that it was written during the first church age because it extended from 53 A.D to about 178 days while brother Brown tells us in the church ages it would behoove us as a people to look back at that first church age and find out where the enemy came in where was his attack what caused that age to fall to find out what it was that took them from the church on the day of Pentecost that fell so hard that we find them over in the Book of Revelation as the cage of every unclean and hateful bird how did that go from that to that where did the devil come in because that's the desire of the devil he would have this church to be unrecognizable this church and the church worldwide he would have it to where it was so unrecognizable that it became nothing more than stories nothing more than doctrines he would have you to be powerless he would have you to be cold lukewarm informal oh that would never happen in this message you better get your head out of the sand you better wake up wake up come in and squeeze the life I like life because it's here you say oh it never happened in this message listen it happened in the age of Paul it happened in the age of Peter it happened in the age of Stephen the church that started in the upper room it happened there the church what's the big deal that church is the pattern that church is the pattern brother Branham says that's what the church was at Pentecost is the standard the standard went into the ground now I understand that was a predestinated thing and they had to go in the ground so that we could be here I understand that but what was it that caused them to fall he says that is the pattern there is no other pattern and Jude is writing just 33 years after Pentecost and he has to tell the people we got to get back to the pattern somewhere we've got off somewhere the pattern isn't lining up to what we're trying to do we got to fight for what we used to have and here we are in 2023 some 58 years since the prophet's gone off the scene and I'm telling you we got to get back to the landmarks we got to get back to what the message is and not what we think the message is I tell you what when I started studying the message for myself you wouldn't believe how many be nice um how many things I've come across that I've been told my whole life brother Branham said brother Brown said brother random said but when you start looking for yourself brother Branham didn't say it you can't find it anywhere and what it is because somebody heard something and they interpreted it like this and they said well brother Branham said this brother Brown said listen it's time that we as Believers not just the ministers get back into the word of God it's time you read your Bible it's time you listen to the messages for yourself and understand that this message wasn't about preachers this message was about you it's about saving you it's about rapturing you I think it's important that you know I can prove it to you I will send unto you Elijah it's for you it's right there in the word we got to get back in it so we can defend the landmarks you don't know what to defend you don't even know what's being attacked if you don't know what the landmarks are get back into the word you can't just sit back and allow the same spirit that came in the first stage that began to cause them to cool off and it came in so subtle listen just go back and read the first church age the spirit of the Nicolaitans came in and began to Rob spiritual worship from the people and they made it to where only only the ministry was gifted or the priesthood was gifted and nobody else had a gift well of course they did you know how powerful that would make me if y'all were a bunch of nobodies and I was the only one gifted you had to come to me with every question and everything what a Doctrine laughs no but all are to participate in spiritual worship all can go before the throne of grace all can call on the name of the Lord when they have a need you can lay your hand on your sick child's forehead and say in the name of Jesus by his stripes he's healed Satan get away with my family you can go to prayer you can call out for a loved one you can call out for the ministry you can pray for your wife you can pray for your husband and God hears you just as much as he hears anybody else he hears you your faith has saved you who was it what was it that turned Hattie Wright's children he wasn't the prophet of God it was perfect thank you it was her response to the word it was her saying that's truth that's truth and it turned and it would save their children oh what was it when the soldier came to Jesus and he said thy faith has saved your servant your faith don't be afraid to operate your face that's a landmark of the scripture you can operate the power of God he's wanting people to operate it he's looking for people to operate him he's looking for people that don't say maybe it's for them maybe it's for them but no the angel of the Lord comes in this building and speaks to your heart and somebody says be it unto me Lord according to Thy word yes that's for me yes that's mine yes I'll take it yes I'll fight for it be it unto me Hallelujah laughs we can't give a foothold [Music] it's all at stake it's all at stake everything's at stake these aren't games your life's at stake your souls at stake your children the body changed the Rapture the culmination of everything it's all at stake who's gonna defend who's going to hold the line when the enemy's coming in like a flood he says the enemy comes in like a flood I'll raise up a standard you ever wondered who that standard is going to be that's not some mythical wall I'm gonna raise up a people I'm gonna raise up people that'll stand the enemy's coming in like a flood but here I stand I'll Stand Here let it flood let the waters rage but I believe in Holiness come on now I believe in modesty I believe in gifts I believe in Repentance I believe in the whole world that it's flooding in there's a standard I'm looking at the standard I'm looking at the people of the standard a people called to defend the landmarks We're not gonna give an answer to the devil [Applause] you are the standard foreign we can't play games he wants to destroy you your homes are at stake your families are at stake victories at stake brother Adam says the time has come that God will gather his church together under one great big banner of the Lord Jesus Christ and pour out his powers among them and great signs and wonders will take place the time has come the time has come for the Pentecostal Church to make a stand the time has come to circumcise the church and call out this foolishness the time has come to go back to the old Landmark the time has come for the outpouring the time has come for the Gathering of the people the time has come for Jesus to come the time will be here soon to give out rewards brother be careful that your crown isn't set on someone else's head the time has come we're at the end time if we're ever going to do anything Brethren we're going to do it now the time is at hand the time is at hand for us to stand we can't wait for somebody else to do it we can't perpetuate the ages this is the final age you are the final voice you are the final voice what's your life saying is the final voice to the final Aid saying that God don't move that way no more well you know maybe if we find you a good psychiatrist maybe we can you can lay on his couch and talk to him about your depression and and he'll teach you how to how to live with it and deal with it and and and you know that anxiety if we get you on 47 110 pills we might can make you smile again Hey listen I'm not against doctors I've had to use them myself quite a bit I'm not against medicine but when we get to the place that our message Believers are a bunch of illegal drug addicts because we ain't got the faith to stand up Say by his stripes I'm Healed listen there is a bomb in Gilead there is that still flows there is his stripes still work what's the final voice saying is it saying yeah he don't move that way no more or is it saying Hebrews 13 8 he is the same yesterday today and forever that is the very foundation of the message that we believe it was the slogan of the message he's the same today as he was yesterday and he'll be the same tomorrow if you're sick today he's a Healer if you're bound today he's to deliver if you're in a cave somewhere he'll set you free he said that I can still go free or you bound up today I say walk out of the prison cell the doors are open walk out he's saying come come drink of the Water of Life freely the final boys is saying freedom Rapture Victory that's the final voice to the final age I say Proclaim it let your life speak it [Applause] your life should speak what the message spoke your life just say he's the same he'll fill with the Holy Ghost he'll save the Lost he'll deliver the bound that's what your life should say not some stagnant pull some broken sister he didn't come to produce a new denomination but it's flowing water it's Rivers it's bubbling up it never stops you should be so overflowed and so bubbling out that other people that are thirsty can drink from the Overflow [Applause] it's time to take another drink some of y'all been sober way too long some of y'all live in message AAA meetings I don't know how I'm Gonna Act guess what get drunk you won't care that's what I'm telling you get drunk one time on the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey go ahead you can label me Pentecostal that's fine that's who my people was I ain't got no problem being labeled a Holy Roller brother random said why I am a Holy Roller I identify with what the prophet said right there under the anointing I don't mind getting excited I don't mind you know why the devil don't like it because when you get free he can't stop you his chains get drunk oh Hallelujah I ain't scared of it pour it out Lord let the fire of God pour out in this place I say fight for the landmarks of the original Pentecostal blessings foreign [Music] flying over and he said come out of her my people hey too long too long we done got down that denominational pin and let our worship get boxed up again hey you know what my shirt's coming on too but that's okay chickens and the eagle hurt the same string but it's on the chicken sound I don't like all that shouting around here it goes but the eagle said Mama that's me right there and they're gonna flap his wings he began to flip oh I can't fly that's all right just get up on a fence post this morning catching up draft this morning and before long you might be sworn in the heaven last catching up draft this morning don't be scared of it spread your wings clap a little bit slap a little bit it's okay Hallelujah you're making it all dusty in the chicken pan I can't even hear what the preach I'm sorry Mr Chicken but Daddy called me and I'm a little bit excited this morning because it won't be long I'm going home I'm Gonna Fly with things you can stay down here and eat worms all you want there's Eagle food and I'm going to get it out of the area [Applause] [Music] let's rain this back in a minute we might get excited [Music] first age the Zeal they had the signs and wonders that's how it started power of God was undeniable but slowly they became relaxed and we know we already said it and then the name means aim that and relax look at Paul still been there he'd have cried out if Peter had still been there he'd have cried out Stephen had still been there I'll say it if brother Brown was still here I'm afraid there's a lot of us wouldn't like his preaching [Applause] because he would have cried out against this cold formal lodges where there's no light there's no birth there's nothing happening there's no moving of the spirit people sit there like a bump on a pickle and say bless me if you can Peter cried out against it but Paul saw it coming he wrote about in the scriptures just like our prophets are coming and warned about it Paul's art coming he tried to warn them of the subtle priesthood that would come in and try to take over and would strip the Holy Spirit Worship from the laity what happened is a generation rose up that wasn't in the upper room [Applause] how many generations are we removed from the prophet generation rose up that it was all just stories well my grandpa said that they're in the upper room well my mama's aunt's first cousin had told her and they didn't know nothing about it for themselves to a stories and when it's just stories about how God moved through a prophet versus experiencing the same God that moved in the prophet moving in you the same miraculous the same Authority listen I hold bro Brown in the highest of regards as we should but the pillar of fire didn't leave when he left the pillar of fire still here and if you thought for a moment it was brother Branham doing those works and not the pillar of fire you got a little bit off the pattern a little bit and so the same Pillar of Fire that operated through brother Branham why was he doing that why I understand or to draw our attention to the word absolutely but it was to show you the power that laid in the word listen testimonies are not to tell us what God used to do testimonies are to give us faith for what God's gonna do that's what testimonies well God did this God did that Hallelujah that means today God will do the same thing he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost if you let him he'll pour His Spirit out in you today if you land he's the same yesterday today and forever oh thank you man began to control the way the services went instead of the spirit well we've seen this many songs then we called the preacher out on this exact song and don't you dare Miss I hate won't even come out what if we don't sing The Rise huh and then we'll be allowed to sing two songs at the end of service Hey listen every church has things they do regularly I'm not knocking that but when we get to the place to we're afraid to let the spirit move hey I so appreciate it this morning we didn't care if song service was an hour is here to worship I I sat right back there I said Thank You Lord that there ain't a people so boxed in that's like well we're not gonna let you and you sing because that'll make the song service go too long I say let's worship God we give so much time to so many other things we do so many other things we don't care listen we don't care how long that movie is we don't care how long that ball game is what about when the King of Kings and the Lord of lords wants a fresh drink of water I said give him some water I say pour it out I say worship pour it out hey I'll give you another drink and another drink and another drink we didn't hear two and a half hours are you still thirsty Lord have another drink this morning don't be afraid to worship you have a right to worship today Hallelujah Brown says oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good it seems so sound then it caught a hold and like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church that's why we cried against formalism in a church let me make something real clear everybody Ain't Gonna Worship like me everybody ain't gonna jump around and I'll use the way brother Brown said it and act idiotic like I do I don't expect you to some people just raised their hands and worship and tears streamed down their face my point is just worship him with all you have in the way that you're called to when he comes in the building that's what freedom of worship is I've said it before what they ended up with in Azusa Street was not freedom of worship because they had to speak in tongues they had to run the owls they had to jump it so it was no longer a freedom it was actually a bondage freedom is that when he comes in this building I'm free to worship him how I am called to worship him if that means run jump shout dance I say you better do it if that's what you're called to do but let me tell you what I told Brother about her last night I don't know I don't care how you worship but in no religion anywhere is this a form of worship all right [Applause] that ain't worship anywhere he's in the building how do I know he said he'd be here and he's calling for somebody who's not afraid to say that's my king that's my Lord that's my savior that's my deliverer I'm not afraid to worship Him and some of you were called to go if you don't be ahead and order be of emphatic head nodder I'll tell you what I'ma still alive from Brother Baker he said if you're going to be a tear at least be a Biblical tear because they shouted when the rain fell [Applause] if even the weeds and the tariffs can worship and they recognize what he's done and they recognize who he is and they're going to be gathered and burned what about the world going to be gathered in the Harvest taken into the Garner take it into a Rapture I say we ought to be free to worship the King of Kings he's taken us out of the Cesspool out of this chicken pen and the least we can do is give him a little worship [Applause] I'm gonna try to move on a little bit [Music] why do you cry out against it because it's a python that'll squeeze the life out of the church to where there's no atmosphere for birth I'll tell you something this atmosphere this morning all things are possible all things are popped that's why he hates this atmosphere that's why he puts up scarecrows because right behind the Scarecrow is the fruit he puts up that scarecrow so don't get too fanatical don't get too emotional most of us ain't gotta worry about that I promise I'm saying he said some of you need to get out of order long enough to get saved now let me throw a little something at you hey if you don't like this one you can spit it out that's okay I give you permission but think about who he mostly was preaching to he was mostly an Assembly of God churches mostly in Pentecostal churches people that we call sometimes God bless them but sometimes people Point them like oh they're fanatical and they're this and they're that brother Brown's talking to those people saying they had too much order said you need to get out of order long enough to get saved what would he say to some of us now I ain't saying that to y'all this morning because y'all are awesome y'all are pulling that incredible and I want you to think I'm beating you over the head I'm just telling you to guard against that Spirit watch that Spirit that'll try to come in and try to Rob this joy that you're experiencing today from your life try to take it from you we don't want that because when there's no atmosphere there's no birth there's no atmosphere there's no Deliverance there's no healing there's no opportunity for our children to have their own experience I believe sometimes that we've Church ordered the Holy Spirit right out of our services and that python Spirit comes and some of us are wrapped up in it we don't even know we try we want to raise our hands we want to worship what's restraining you that spirit got you bound go on you you want to say hallelujah but you get out of it's wrapped around your vocal cords it's on the list I'll tell you what one of my favorite people in the Bible this might not be normal to say but one of my favorite people in the Bible is a legion because you know what brother Brown says in one place he says those demons that had Legion bound would have never come to the feet of Jesus he said Legion drug them there you got something bothering you this morning you got depression you got anxiety you got no freedom I say okay you want to turn yourself to me I'm gonna drag you to the feet of Jesus this morning I'm gonna bring you into the presence of the King on freedom get loose from that thing get your hands up shout Praises To the King of Kings Hallelujah that spirit's off my life I'm free to worship I'm free to praise a pardon is not a pardon if it's not accepted as a pardon it's being waved in front of you and some people are going now I'm good sitting here dead you don't have to be there's life here offer for you today there's freedom and no I'm not talking about the jump in the shop I'm talking about the thing that'll put a jump and a shout in you that's what I'm talking about this morning problem is a lot of people don't think it's for them that's a lie the devil it's all for you that's what we're talking about everything is for you it's for you to take today and of course Satan comes and he wants to convince people that it's all just an emotional workup I told the brother the other day I said listen if I knew how to work people up I might would sometimes because that's sometimes it's dead you're like man if I knew the switch if I knew what to say if I knew I could do this and that and it'd wake some people up I might would do it but I ain't found it yet all I know to do is preach the word and when that spirit moves over that sea something on the inside of that seed gets a little bit excited but the devil wants to convince you it's hard worker why of course he wants dead Services because in dead Services he's never cast out in dead surfaces there's no freedom and dead Services people don't draw closer to the Lord in dead Services there's no births it's cool it's it's a morgue it's a place for death so what does he do he takes the word it takes quotes and he misinterprets and he twists it to rob people of their joy and their freedom in the house of God and I'm not afraid to call it out today this I'm going home today if you don't like me I'll be back in Louisiana it's okay I'm not afraid to call it out we can't we can't be dead none of we can't be he's not coming back for a dead church amen the first age relax and the Wolves came in and began to move the landmarks and I'm gonna do my best to bring the rest of this quickly brother Brown says repent quickly don't hesitate he says evidently Ephesus hesitated for her lifespan was not very long I want you to listen to this struck me so hard this is the age of Peter the age of Paul the age of Stephen and there's many others I know but listen the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly it was not the city was in Ruins its glorious Temple became a shapeless Mass the land became on Mars inhabited by waterfowl the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalid Village there was not one Christian left the lamp had been rent from its place and it all started brother Brown tells it very clearly the church age by them trying to tone down the worship just tone it down a little bit because that jumping and shouting how am I gonna bring my boss man to work how am I going to bring this Roman general to the church service if y'all are acting like this just tone it down a little bit make it more presentable and it was in the toning down that the freedom was lost and the shackles were put on don't ever tone down your worship don't ever turn down your praise and from this point on the stones began to be moved and the landmarks slowly began to move a little here and move a little there and and we know about a lot of these the landmark of the of the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ would go on for for 300 years until Rome moved that landmark to a baptism in the titles a father Son and Holy Ghost I don't care how long they do it that way it'll never be the landmark of the word they can baptize that way for ten thousand years and it'll never be the landmark of the word because there was no person in the Bible ever baptized any other way than in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a landmark that's a landmark in the word that'll never be the landmark of scriptural baptism to do in titles when Peter had just been given the kingdom he just keys to the kingdom he just come out of the upper room and they asked how can we be saved how can we receive what you've received he said repent be baptized every one of you in the Trinity Doctrine no repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's a landmark it's a landmark in the scripture that we can't let be moved the truth of the godhead was moved listen they didn't believe in three Gods on the day of Pentecost they didn't believe in three Gods they're in the beginning of the church it became a foundational doctrine of Rome at the nazian council 325 A.D the truth of justification was moved the truth of sanctification was moved and in their place came man-made landmarks that wrongfully placed salvation in a church instead of in Jesus proper worshipings and spirit and truth that Landmark was moved the supernatural moving of the spirit amongst the people was moved and a new Landmark was set up to where God only spoke to the priesthood brother Brown says that false Vine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right taught that the church had to be governed it taught a control over the people but instead of doing it's God's way they simply took Authority invested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people he says and even right today those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it he said this is a far cry from Paul have said that when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship they stick with me for about 10 more minutes as we bring this to a close even John Wesley we don't often quote John Wesley but listen to him say this he says the grand reason why the miraculous gifts were so soon withdrawn was not only that faith in Holiness were lost but that dry formal Orthodox men began to ridicule the gifts that they themselves did not have and they began to decry all other gifts as Madness or imposter one generation is all it takes to become unrecognizable one generation for all this stuff listen there's a landmark for Holiness in the scripture we can talk about all this other stuff too that but there's also Holiness in the scripture as a landmark I'm not afraid to stand for the Bible speaks of a way a man should dress in the way a woman should dress the Bible speaks about a way we should keep our hair the way man should have short hair and a woman should have long hair those are landmarks in the Bible I didn't put them there he did we got to be willing to stand for it doesn't matter if it upset people the prophet of God would tell us he says he somebody says you're going to lose your ministry if you don't quit saying those things he said any Ministry that will be ruined by preaching the word needs to be ruined they're landmarks that we have to stand for I don't have to be ashamed in saying those things because it's in the word let me skip some of this [Music] started so innocent that first age so subtle when it came in and but now the landmarks were totally moved and and the truths of God's word have been completely replaced by Creeds we can see that just looking at history and and down through the age if the landmarks removed further and further and further away from the original to where that church like we said earlier became unrecognizable and that seems like a a gloomy and a bleak picture but there was a scripture that said I will restore saith the Lord he wasn't going to leave the landmarks in that condition as a matter of fact it wasn't the landmarks that actually had moved it was the people that had moved away from the landmarks and he was calling people to come come back to the established truth come back to the established word it had been so far removed that it was unrecognizable but Luther comes and God works in his life and he takes the landmark of justification in this place back in his proper place and then he takes a Wesleyan he comes and he takes the landmark of sanctification and is put back in its proper place and then the Azusa movement God uses that movement to take the landmark of gifts working in the body and places them back in their proper place no they didn't stay in its proper place but he placed them properly they were placed properly oh my can't you see why we had to have Malachi 4 in this day can't you see why everything had to be turned back this Landmark was here this Landmark was there this Landmark was there but he said I will restore I'm going to turn you back to the faith I'm gonna turn you back to the landmarks I'm gonna turn you back to the truth and now that has come back and people want to start moving it again that's why I'm telling you tonight we got to contend we gotta stand we gotta fight we've got to defend the landmarks cause it only takes one generation it only takes a few years before suddenly things are unrecognizable and suddenly things are stories and suddenly that don't really matter anymore but the prophet of God comes and the godhead is put in his proper place baptism is put in his proper place predestination original sin the Mysteries are finished the tribulation of the church the Rapture of the bride all these things come and they get put in their their proper place and they get put in order and for the first time now here's where I'm trying to bring this back around to why I said we have to study the first church age to see where Satan came in because For the First Time In 2000 years Satan looks and goes I recognize that church I recognize that group I haven't seen them in 2000 years but I've seen them before that's that same group of people that came stumbling out of the upper room on the day of Pentecost I recognize them because suddenly the same power that cast him out then is casting him out now the same word that exposed them then is exposing him now the same word that would Trail the serpent is trailing the serpent again and he sees it and he says at that same group as those same people and he recognizes once again the power of God in the midst of a people and he says what caused them to fall the first time what worked the first time you're not facing new attacks you're facing the same attacks that the first church age faced because you're operating in the same power that first church age operated in but let me explain something to you they were predestinated to go into the ground why brother hearing because of you because you were predestinated to be the crop that came up in the last day they were predestinated oh they couldn't help it but you're predestinated not to fall you're predestinated to take a Rapture you're predestinated for a body change what are you scared for what are you worried about am I gonna make it yes you're gonna make it I can't help but make it I can't help but go you are the Rapture you are the message you are Jesus Christ in a broad body this Rapture can't go without me I am a Rapture that's what I've been called to don't let that choke you it's who you are it's what you're called to but he's coming to try to choke it out again how formalism questioning the supernatural questioning the authority of the word calling everything a worked up emotion slowly that snake trying to squeeze life again because the Revival excuse me the cycle of Revival and death has never failed until now there was a message and that go in the ground there was a message that go on the ground there was a message that go underground this day there was a message and we're going in a Rapture hallelujah it's this come Revival death Revival death Revival death Revival Rapture it's the time forward you're called to it it's what this message is all about it's not about correct doctrines although there are it's about a Rapture it's about a people it's about bone of his bone being manifested on this Earth again this bride recognizes the LIE you're not gonna Rob my joy you're not gonna Rob my praise you're not going to take my children you're not gonna take my health I'm here to stand on the landmarks I will fight for he is the same yesterday today and forever I will fight for by his stripes I am healed I will fight for the baptism of the Holy Ghost somebody's gonna stand in defend and say these are the landmarks and they belong to me and you cannot have them [Applause] you say you sure do repeat yourself a lot brother Aaron well I taught sixth graders for 15 years sometimes you need to hear things a few times before it starts sinking in he's talking to me you know who I'm talking to this morning you [Music] in case you was wondering it's all about you it's all that's always been about you are people that would stand yes many times people wonder even in my home Church brother Aaron why are you always hammering about the supernatural why you always hammering about the gifts why you always hammering about the movie of the spirit because that's where the attack has been and when he comes in like a flood he raises up a standard that's where the attack has been and so because of that attack we're always putting it out there before you that's why we stand for the moving of the spirit and the new birth and the gifts in operation how long would it take I want you to think about this for a minute how long would it take if we just allowed these attacks to go unchallenged before the power of God was just a story and unfortunately in some places it is already to where it was just something that we once had and mama told me that this miracle happened one time how many of y'all have heard of Life Tabernacle Shreveport Louisiana brother Branham preached there over and over that's where brother Jack Moore was and he'd come to Shreveport all the time he preached sermons there like the token Investments the countdown invisible Union on the wings of a snow white dove and let me tell you that church sits there today then empty never accepted the fullness of the message at all William Branham is a name barely even remembered there now whispered amongst a few about maybe oh he was that guy that you know he he got off a little bit you know some people remember him as yeah he used to be a friend a pastor brother Jack Moore I found a a Facebook page of theirs because I live right there in Shreveport near it and it was the memories of Life Tabernacle and it was about the older people there in the congregation and a lot of the pictures were blocked because I wasn't a member and I don't think they was going to let me be [Music] but I could see a lot of them so I'd scroll through the pictures and see and I kept coming across pictures of brother Brown and most of them was because it was actually a picture of brother Jack Moore but brother Brown would be with him it was neat because there was a lot of these pictures I'd never seen before but in the comments you would see comments of people asking hey who's that guy with brother Jack look I just listed a couple of the sermons preached there he went there every year and held week-long meetings during Thanksgiving week every year and they say who is that guy oh that's one of brother Jack's Old Friends I think his name might have been Branham one generation towards just a whisper some little story look at the first age 120 years gone gone this isn't about denominations anymore you know for years you and I'm not saying it never gets preached but you hear a lot of sermons about what the denominations didn't have and why we had to come out and and that was all truth we were called out but listen to me when Israel got to kadish it wasn't about Pharaoh anymore they had already left Egypt there was a whole generation of people you know that were born in the wilderness that never knew Egypt it wasn't pharaoh and his army keeping the people from taking the land pharaoh and his army wasn't even there we got a quick point to the well this denomination this denomination this number they ain't hindering us this isn't us problem this isn't us problem we've been called to go take the land there's nobody here hindering us but us it's time that we throw down the shackles and throw down the fear and throw down the doubt it's in a crossover and take the land quit being afraid quit listening to the negative report quit surrounding yourself with negativity there's a reason Joshua only sent two spies into the land he didn't need the mother ten he was done with the negativity I say we start surrounding ourselves but people are saying yes we can yes we can take the land yes we can be healed yes we can be filled yes I can have my children yes I can have Victory yes I can have the land it's not them hindering us this isn't us problem we gotta face the music is a landmark you must repent you must be born again you must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost business I can have a couple more minutes this is ever since Israel was returned to the land and officially became a nation in 1948 they've had to fight for their very existence they've had to defend their borders and their and their landmarks at all costs and listen because Israel knows what it means to be destroyed they knows what they know what it means to lose the land they know what it means to have a holocaust and for the enemy to try to wipe them out but ever since then for years now the enemy has been coming and actually attacking Jewish cultural sites or what we would call landmarks and many people around the world look at it and say well what's the big deal they're not actually attacking people they're not hurting people there aren't any casualties so it seems like no big deal but what groups like Isis and the different Palestinian groups have learned is that these landmarks give legitimacy to the Jewish culture and legitimacy to the claim the Jews that this land belonged to them first and so if they can destroy the landmarks they can wipe away the claim that the Jewish people have to the land they can wipe away the legitimacy of their right to even exist in that region and because the enemy claims that the land doesn't belong to them and it never was there sound familiar and it never was theirs but the landmarks prove otherwise the landmarks prove who was there first and so they come in and they attack it and they try to destroy these Heritage sites in the region in an attempt to wipe the Slate clean and rewrite history in their own image says the Palestinian Authority recently seized control over telleroma and brought in heavy engineering equipment to pave a road over parts of the ruins thereby causing inestimable damage adding insult to injury then they had the gall to hold a formal ceremony and declare that the built by The Maccabees to be a Palestinian heritage site not only does he tell you that you never had a right to this land but he tries to tell you it's always been mine listen it's true that man gave up our rights and our position when we fell but it never was his to belong with he was nothing but a squatter and the Lord Jesus comes and he tears it from that place and he puts us back every right he ever had was stripped from him that day on Calvary and he put you back in that position and all the landmarks down through the word true that the land is yours it proves that you were there first Satan wasn't there first man was there first the land belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us that Eden belongs to us we're returning to a land of Eden we're returning to a millennium because it belongs to us it doesn't matter what the enemy has or what the enemy is then it'll never belong to him it belongs to us and he says it was never yours you never had a right to the holy ghost that the gifts are for a day gone by you can't have these things and it's an attack on the landmarks because he wants to prove that those things never exist today man but Israel has a motto if you ever I've never been but I have friends that go and and they they take these tours of these places and these holy sites and I don't remember the names of all of them they have this motto and their military motto is never again never again they said we tried to be passive we let the enemy come in and take us we let the enemy cage us up we let the enemy they said but never again never again I say it's time we adopt the motto of the Israelites never again will he come in and take my children never again is he gonna have my joy never again will I bow down to depression never again wipe out onto anxiety never again will I come to the house of God and fail to get praise where praise is due never again will I miss prayer time never again will I live gold never again will I live lukewarm never again will I backslide never again will I go back to the world never again never again never again he'll never rob me ever again I'm gonna defend the landmarks I'm gonna defend what's mine never again he won't take anything from me ever again I'll take my health I'll take my joy I'll have my family I'll have my children I'll have my worship I'll have the Holy Ghost I'll be robbed never again never again will I settle for lukewarm never again will I settle for cold never again never again I'm going to defend the landmarks he's looking for a people that'll be faithful he's looking for a people that'll stand because he stood how many can justify he's always been faithful he'll always be faithful he's asking will you be brother Matt would you come sing that song for me listen as he comes and gets ready to sing this song I want y'all to sing it with us in worship he's looking for people that'll defend the landmarks that'll stand for truth I almost made it through a whole sermon without talking about history I gotta tell y'all a story xenophon was a Greek mercenary General who led an expedition of ten thousand mercenary Greeks hired by Cyrus the younger to overthrow his brother the Persian king artist Xerxes and long story short it didn't go real well for Cyrus he got killed right off the bat now xenophon this Greek General stunk in a Strange Land with the ten thousand of his brothers and he's trying to get back home and he was a a writer and so he journals their Chronicle Chronicles their Journey Through the modern day land of our trying to get back to Greece and he writes about how they came through the modern day land of Iraq and they saw these absolutely massive fortifications bigger than anything ever built in Greece was John and he says in his writings we March one stage six pair of things to a great stronghold deserted and lying in Ruins the foundations of his wall was made of polished stone full of shells it was 50 feet in breadth 50 in height upon this Foundation was built the wall of brick 50 feet wide and a hundred feet high and the Circuit of the wall was 20 miles think of the size of this city Giant beautiful it's beautiful like like this church come a beautiful place law there's life here there was once life in that City but it was deserted there wasn't a single soul there and the amazing thing about it is the general that was chasing them wrote about the same city so We Came Upon This City 21 miles behind all this giant stuff but no one knows anything about it no one knew who built it nobody knew the name of it it was all guessing and it comes to find out years later that it was the ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh and this is only 200 years later what am I talking to you about how quick can things be lost 200 years later and nobody even knows what's going on because the medes and the Babylonians when they captured Assyria they wiped out every person and all the culture and they said we don't want anybody to ever remember this place even existed they wiped out everything so there'd be no remembrance 200 years and nobody knew and the devil would love to come and start wiping things out wipe out the moving of the spirit tour one day it's just a story man I remember it seems like people used to shout in our church no it seems like one time one time I think somebody spoke in tongues I'm not real sure I think one time there was a prophecy that I don't know if people here and people don't remember because it's all wiped out and it becomes a story and after a while the story even gets forgotten and it's just he's not just after your door oh I know I preach a lot about joy and peace and happiness because he's looking for a footholder and it takes your joy then it comes after you peace then he comes after you worship then it comes after this now you got
