========================================

fritz fritz al fritz that's right amen says he used to have a dog named fritz and he would cut coons he would catch possibly he would catch anything that he wanted to but i'll tell you what when he came to an old possum he had a hold back dude i don't know what he did he wouldn't attack that possum but brother brandon being his master said look them said french get him that was it folks i have had to wash dogs with all kinds of stuff where they got my dog got into skunk i don't want him to get in the skunk but he didn't care what he smelled like he was going to get that scum he got that skunk he says that's the way it is when a congregation does a man but you know what i also thought of of my own thought my own thought is that when somebody says amen it's like having a little fire and taking a whole cup of what gas and just stuff it on on there poof that's what it does now let me ask you them if the amen will do that to the holy ghost what will quiet shh no amens huh what if this morning nobody amen no response i would already be struggling for my next scripture here well what am i going to say next you know that's right but you ignite the fire how many knows when you come to the church can i ask you another question this is another one of my questions i'm getting them both mixed up now if you got anything out of church what did you have to bring to get it what did you have to have when you came to church and what did you have to do when you came to church if you're going to get anything any rants go ahead that's it brother joshua expect a prophet's title he said you get what you expect you had to come with expectation that's a problem sometimes we go to church we just think well we're going to have another church there he's going to be enough to all mine and he said if you come if you want to come and you want to find fault yeah are you going to find any yes [Applause] i'm sure before steve got done you had something that you could find thought with what brother steve said and expressed even maybe coming up and reading the script maybe you fought for that if you come to find fault and sure plenty of it amen but i thank god we don't have fault finders here this morning because you certainly go out those doors worse than what you came in how many wants to go out the door is different than what you came in amen and if you don't have the kind of life that you want to have amen don't go out those dogs this morning until you're 100 for sure that the holy spirit has spoken to your heart and says look if you're not living the way you're supposed to then you better change the way that you're living every day because you can't do the same thing every time and come to church and expect the church to be different no sir it's insanity you're blinded if you think that's going to happen the only way that you're kind of closer up with god and the man when he was talking about an over 80 old young man old woman he says you know if i asked him what would be your heart's desire he says and they would say that it is a closer walk with god that's what i don't care how old we get we wanna close to walk with god that's what we come for a closer look with god that's what enoch had he had a close walk with god if we're gonna have a body change you're going to be translated you're going to be walking with god you're going to be walking close to god or you're going to be left behind thus saith the lord hallelujah you'll be left behind if you do not have a close walk with god all these little things got to go by the wayside amen or are we in those courts that brother ben talked about there's the outer court there's the inner court and then there's the holies of holies amen some people are get justified they get picked up they come to church but every time they man the first time they come up to a red sea and they begin to complain and murmur because they aren't patient they don't wait on god be still and know that i am god they have a problem comes along the first time david complained remember that what israel did oh my god they were justified god called him out of egypt and then let him come up to that red sea the trouble strike this ain't right moses what kind of a leader are you take us into a dead end like this huh even moses didn't know what to do and he had to crowd god isn't that right oh my where are you huh who are you now right where are you with god first of all you gotta know who you are that you're a son and daughter of god now something's happened down in your heart that has changed you from you what you used to be all right i'm not the man i used to be you're not the woman that you used to be praise be to god praise be to god let me tell you what this is like let me tell you about the walk that we're to have with almighty god it's like this a young man and a young girl meet each other and they talk to each other they get to know each other they fall in love with each other amen when i met my wife and i wanted to communicate with her i said what's your phone number here's my phone number you can call me anytime huh i want to communicate with her she says well that won't won't be happening then don't let me call guys you'll have to call me what you said you'll have to call me folks i didn't have a problem ringing the phone off the hook and that right they call and they're calling the caller no i can't wait till sunday till i can see you hey man you begin to oh my i want to be closer to her amen just a bit of romance here i used to drive a motorcycle around a big old black overcoat on and knowing a biler i ran out of gas it was about church time and i was just about a half a mile down the road maybe not even that and i was walking came into church and i guess i've thumbed i guess and they were coming to church they saw me and donna should tell the story she said sonic she says mom can i stop and pick him up she said yeah you can stop and pick me up i was in the back seat there and you know i was looking at the mirror and she looked in the mirror she said all that he caught be looking oh my but that's how we started out it's like that it's that you know and you're like man i can't wait till the next time i can see her you get engaged and you can't wait to get married why because you want to be together and you go and you see each other i mean in that right you fly here you fly there you go wherever you want whoever just to get to know each other just to be with each other because that's your desire you can't wait for the day to where you live together same house same place have fellowship and be together and that's the way it is with god and with you he wants us to get closer and closer and one of these aids we're going to be with him it's a love relationship lord talk to me some more lord communicate with me let me hear that still small voice [Applause] because we're in the process of getting closer to each other and one of these days we'll be together forever amen praise the lord oh my you love him this morning praise be to god so we come to church we come under expectation because we know that everything has been provided for us every blessing of god every word of god as long as jesus sitting on that meteor mediator seat there is there's an ability to receive the blessings of god no matter what it is no matter whether it's baptism whether it's baptism of the holy ghost whether it's salvation whether it's healing whether it's joy whether it's a closer walk with god oh my it's there for us if you desire it amen but we have to be careful a tree is known by its fruit can i get a little sticky here now a christian according to paul said that we look to things that are not seen not to the things that are seen how many believes the holy ghost looks further than the things of the world in first john 3 and verse 15 this is kind of to test us to see where we're at and to see what kind of fruit we have in our life amen here it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world what does that cover everything it didn't say just certain things neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him can we say it this way if you love the things that you have to have to live every day if you love those things more than you love god the love of god is not even in you if it takes precedence over the love of almighty god then the love of god isn't in you because if the love of god is in you then you love and you look to the things that are not seen because the holy spirit is a long-range vision amen how many believes we've got to keep our balance in things for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever hey amen i'll tell you right now it's so easy to get our to not be balanced in our daily life with the things that are spiritual and the things that are natural amen just this week with the water and everything spent like three days and i was very concerned about the water and digging it and so forth and that by saturday needing to go back do one more thing and so forth and then by saturday night i said you know i really don't like it i don't like that i got so busy now to preach to y'all about being so busy that you don't have time for god and then by the time i got to really study and i began to look at the clock and say you know look look what you've done for everything else now here towards the end of the day you want to give god the last of the day huh i'm like lord well i would like to have a good service tomorrow i want the people to enjoy the service i want the holy spirit there amen god can still do it no i wasn't all that busy y'all would have probably better brother you'd apologize brother you were slow you didn't get nothing done today because i know what it's like to be young hey man you can get a trillion things done when you're young when you get my age guess what it's only half a trillion but yet you know i ask myself you have to ask yourself how much time did you spend when you get up in the morning what is your daily routine what is your daily rotation amen you get up do you forget to pray how much time do you spend in prayer and how many believe that it shouldn't be five or ten minutes and that's all you ever do all your life know it you get to be more and more and more i'll tell you what in my heart's desire if i can't i i buy these little speakers and you can carry your phone right here and if you want to you can hook it on your belt over here it might be a little dangly but you can have the bible playing all the time you can have the message playing all the time now i don't know i know people got jobs you can't do all of that but for you you're your own boss huh you can do that you can listen to a lot more than what you might even think and that's i like to hear it right but the bible talks doesn't the bible tell us amen bind it upon your bed tell us when they'll get this done think about it during the day think about it that night think about it we'd be different people if we'd be more like that amen i tell you why we need to lean to the left side of the road a little bit more when it comes to more of the spiritual and less of the natural i think we can agree i bet you can agree this morning that your natural part is a whole lot more than the spiritual part it's not balanced like it should be and then you wonder why your prayers go unanswered why it seems like god don't answer your prayer hey man you come to church you're all sad why we wear a frown and why we don't have joy amen why we can't shake each other's hand after church or amen in love by one another didn't john he was a man of love he spoke of love and he said children walk in love how many days that's the way we ought to walk walk in love amen praise be to god it's to bring stability the holy ghost is our regulator that brings a balance to our lives it brings a balance to our lives not too much this way not too much that way but right down the middle of the road the way that it's supposed to be now how many knows there's a lot of people even brother ben preach the message why are the people so tossed about like i said those outer courts the inner courts you find people that are on top of the mount one day and the next day boy i tell you what you wouldn't want to get around that person's huh we're up we're down we're in we're out how many knows this life is like a mountain railroad like the song says hey man you go up all over the mountains down through the valleys through the tunnels through the scary places through the swamps through the deserts and if you're living by every time you get on top of the mountain praise be to god you get down in a valley and oh my wow is he walls he woo huh we're all sad and blue you've never entered into the chicana glory what did brother branham say about brother neville question what did he say i know he said a lot of things thank you brother joe you answered the question give yourself a star he was always the same that's my desire lord help me not to be up down in out here there everywhere folks no the same all the time now that's good if it's good bad if it's bad right but i know with brother neville it was good because he was a christian that lived what he preached and everything else and he was solid and he was stable and kept down that middle of the road well i'll tell you i can't imagine having lived back in that time you know because there's a lot of people that tried to vote brother devil out and everything else brother branham would come in there just in time to say nice everybody happy with brother now oh yeah yeah and the vote went different huh all kinds of friction all kinds of this that the other gossip and everything else if you remember he says when you do those things it hurts the pastor he does that and the other hurt the church and all of that going on but jenny hold steady huh hard to hold steady in the midst of trials and storms and everything that goes on is that right oh y'all know me y'all know i ain't always held steady no i'm not always healthy but by god's grace hello the lord is working on me he's worked on me that i recognize things not just committed to god i just committed to god folks let me tell you something as your pastor folks you got to learn to commit things to god otherwise you will get your own hands in everything and you'll get you'll mess it up worse than you ever could think think amen you love the lord this morning praise be to god god is good isn't he amen we have a tendency to be extreme no it's not just the baller family probably in all of our families we have we attended to be extreme hey when we eat we eat bible says don't be a glutton right yeah we glutton sometimes that's right we eat until we look like we ate and then all of a sudden i'm losing weight and guess what we do next go to the extreme and starve ourselves i'm going on the starvation diet y'all laughing though we're heading home today right cyrus died and we lose all that weight oh look at me i'm all pretty come back about six months later what happened and i'll come back huh why because we go extreme we just tended to be extreme when we do something man we're all in amen forget about everything else i tend to be that way hey when it's springtime comes up i like to see something about fishing let me catch them know how to catch a bass i want to go out there and i'm going to buy a pontoon you know i need a pontoon thomas get a hold of yourself you'll be used that pontoon twice a year and have to pay all kinds of money to keep it up come on get your senses and go down to your creek gotcha if you bluegill go back up there and take care of something else huh yeah last year during both season you know this boat doesn't quite hit the bullseye just ain't hitting right i need to buy me a flight not an olive o i need a new matthews that's what i need i go over there hey sir how much does this run about 1100 ah i don't want to do that go back home and shoot about two three more days hey i'm almost hitting the bull's-eye that's pretty good because all i need is one shot brother joe one time that's really all you need with one broadhead and i'm pretty happy for the year if it's a big buck i'm looking for that don't take 900 to a thousand dollars or 1500 but we want to do it because we extreme whatever we do we go extreme huh is that all right we need to be a little bit more that way towards god folks amen when we come to church how many know that whatever your brother brother m says whenever you're gonna get a baseball game people get into the baseball game they go out there and folks like i told you this summer i'll tell you what we were playing soccer and they were playing softball over there and them parents them little kids couldn't scream that a lot it was the parents why it was just nice yeah boy we gonna need to go play ball they're having a whole lot more fun we are well they're all getting into it get in the spirit when you come to church hello what do you do you get into the spirit of it people fail to get into the spirit boy as a pastor here i'll tell you what if we get this place so full of faith in god amen we get our hearts and our lives so centered on jesus christ until christ the mystery of god revealed christ is the center of everything you do [Music] that's the right balance the right balance is that no matter where you're fishing what you're hunting it doesn't matter what do you bring it back to the balance that god is the center of it all amen folks i failed in those places in those times and i'll tell you what it ain't never no fun it ain't never no good if you don't have a balance amen and this lay out of cihr we're living in i'll tell you one of the most dangerous things according to the scriptures and according to jesus and they fell among thorns are they which when they heard go forth and are choked and with the cares and riches and pleasures of life but cares how many know that's just our carers we got to pay our electric bill got a pair of water bills got to do all of those things but then there's the richest huh there's the richest and the pleasures am i right then the pleasures of life amen that it chokes out the effects of the word i want to just be quiet for a minute and i want you to think about that does any of those categories touch your life the cares of life hey cast all your cares upon him for he cares for you you'll find a hundred dollar bill in the ditch over there if that's what you need to pay your water bill with or whatever it might be but me and you we tend to think that unless i've got a hundred thousand dollars to make i can't pay that water bill [Music] my my my how many wants more of him to be closer to him is my heart's desire let's be you get closer to him and also each and every one of us want to be the same in christ full of love sweet patient long suffering for bearing one another loving one another helping how many wants to be that way and be a christian and be that solid one kind of a person all the time because i'll tell you in this this life this life is nothing about the same nothing stays the same i didn't stay young huh everything changes i think brother tommy was telling me last monday also when we had that good service last sunday monday everything was uh murphy took over murphy's law took over on monday everything could go wrong did go wrong huh you started out the day with this that or the other and this one doesn't have what you want you go to this place and they have what you want but their tow motor doesn't have any gas and they're lows lows don't run out of gas right they tell you we can't do that until this afternoon but i come a long way to get this and i would wouldn't mind don't want to just really sit here until this afternoon huh and then all of a sudden we do this out of the other city there goes the top motor can we use that one you're like why did that happen huh devil's out to grab you of your joy that you got on sunday how many believes the devil will grab you he's nothing but a thief and a robber and a liar and if the devil can rob you he will rob you he's a thief boy i'm glad we put two plate pieces of plywood on this floor oh aren't you glad though that you can have your joy how many needs more dog [Applause] happiness more peace more of the fruit of the spirit more love more care one for another what is the fruit of the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace and meekness and all temperance and patience and all the things most of all patience just be patient seen so many people come in these pews and last for a while and after a while they're gone some by the wayside people go out into the world huh that's right lots of families left here and got divorced and end up divorced you know what i wonder i wonder whether they weren't supposed to stay here but the devil got him off and then they're having their families and their kids in the wind destroyed you better watch what you do you better watch not to be unstable you better know where you stand because the devil will try to destroy you if you possibly can amen oh my praise the lord but i want to be the same i want to be the same loving kind person that i'm every day amen praise be to god what we do every day is what we are so now the question is what are you are you an idolater an idolater is somebody that puts something in front of god yes scott gets second place you're an idolater amen anything you put in front of god god's supposed to be the center line keep your eyes keep your mind keep your heart on god the thing that you used to do when you go home this afternoon if you do something that doesn't draw you closer to god quit doing it do something different whatever it is i don't know i'm not the prophet probably could tell you i can't know but you know what it is that you do amen i don't know what it is could simply be not taking the time in the morning i'll tell you what if i get up in the morning and i miss it sometime but if i don't get up in the morning and i appreciate brother joe said somebody about having a prayer life i believe every person needs a prayer life a place and i don't know maybe i'm funny but i believe even the prophet said god loves it when you kneel before him but to get down on your knees amen and bow before him folk we'll lay on our bed on the back of our pillow and just well lord hello you know come on folks have more respect get down on your knees to talk to him humble adoration to him not that you can't talk to him if you're driving down the road lord i can't heal right now but here i am lord let me talk to you pray everywhere always paul said always be praying everywhere lifting up holy hands singing and making the melody in your hearts i believe that's what we ought to do when we're on our jobs and go on different places sing a little song make a little humming you wouldn't you would be amazed at your workers to hear about us even humming a good gospel song it's good to hear somebody sing something for the lord say something for the lord do something for the lord that's the example making the melody the scripture says keeping in the middle of the road in this message folks we've had people that claim to be in the millennium already we've had people that claim we don't need a five-fold man that's right we don't need a church anymore people that have made brother branham god himself in this message and it's sad to say because he didn't make him an antichrist and they deceived themselves and i guarantee you people like that won't be there because god won't share his glory with no other brother brandon went off the field and says unless this stops i'm going off the field and you people will be responsible for all those people that could have come in you'll answer for it on the day of judgment hello all kinds of fanaticism but it doesn't take away that it's nothing but the truth how many knows jesus christ came and proved himself alive in our generation like could not be denied infallible and everything he preached was exactly according to the word of god he preached what paul preached lord help this church to be a middle of the road church middle of the road people and i believe the holy spirit is telling each and every one of us this morning are you balanced or are you out of balance do you lean too much of one or too much of the other i got to thinking about my work schedule and i believe i need to do like walmart and have some cutbacks we need to cut back on this and we need to cut back on that so that we have more time for god more time for prayer how many is with me all right you raised your hand well dude that didn't i don't know of you must be pretty good but listen how many that knows that you need to make some changes will say god i'm going to make some changes this week starting this morning how many believes our services will be different the atmosphere that people come into when they come into those double doors will be different because i am a firm believer that if a sinner comes walking into that those doors they should not just hear the gospel but they should feel the atmosphere the holy spirit should be so present until it brings conviction upon their heart amen amen the holy spirit can do a work in their life that's what we want to see praise the lord don't be in such a rush walk with the lord quit running so fast it's not about speed it's not about all that it's about walking with the lord and to be pleasing to him amen praise the lord where are you in your walk with god amen do you have to be primed do you have to pray up or do you come prayed up when you come to church amen you come ready to hear from god tell you what i thank the lord for his still small voice that's what brought me to this message just a still small voice saying we need to hear something about how we live every day do you need to change something hello my hand is up first lord i need to change something there's some things in my life that need to change because there's one objective that i have and that is to be ready when the lord comes he may come two o'clock three o'clock may come in the evening may come in the morning may come anytime but i want to be ready when he comes and the number one thing that you want to do is to make sure that your heart is pure before god amen how many believes that your heart has to be pure before god and i believe that's why the lord brought that to my thought about the other the other sunday with sister hope and how she came back from heaven she was actually there but i ran called her back she came back and she made that little bitty minute detail little bitty thing and she made that right because she wants everything right you and i want everything right now i believe that's what god is working on us getting us to make everything right there's a little something that i had that i had done that i hadn't confessed to somebody this week i went to that person i confessed i said look i want to make that confession let me tell you something you know it's hard on the flesh the flesh don't want to do it but that holy spirit in you tells you you ought to it's really not all that bad it was no big thing no major things just small but it was still something we want to be right in our hearts don't we how many loves the lord how many wants a closer walk amen the prophet of god knowing what he did just gave that lady a simple answer read your bible and pray more every day amen pray and read your body that's the only way to get closer to god is to bring that back into the center of his life in her life god bless you this morning stand with me if you will let's bow our heads how many this morning need a revival of the spirit in your soul god bless you god bless you you need a revival of the spirit in your soul you need a refreshing of the spirit in your heart god bless your hands all over the building god bless you god bless you and i'm here to tell you i truly believe with all of my heart that god wants to give it to you he wants to give you a refilling a refreshing from the presence of the lord he wants to clean your heart but he has a word for you and that is that you have to give him your heart unreservedly you have to make him the center of your life again you have to come back to the middle of the road you have to bring everything in your life to a balance not too much of this not too far this way and not too far that way but it's calling from both sides yes we do have emotion yes we do have knowledge and understanding we have a little of both but the solid rock is the word of god and that's what you go by lord jesus you see the hands that are up that need a refreshing that need a refilling lord to need a revival father of the spirit in their souls and father i thank you lord jesus for the revival god that you've given in my heart and in my soul lord jesus and father for changing me lord lord i'm changing from from one thing to another lord a little bit at a time father to a closer walk with you father for we know that we love you and one of these days we'll see you we ask god in the name of jesus christ that each heart and each person in here will think about the changes that they need to make the thing that they need to do different and watch a difference come into their life it'll make a difference we ask god that you'd help us right now this morning to determine and set it in our hearts that it's going to be different we're going to do things different in the areas where we need to and bring a balance into our hearts and souls amen and amen you can be seated again we're going to change the order to service amen and our my granddaughter praise be to god amen i think it was just a few days ago it seemed like that i was rejoicing because i had a granddaughter then two granddaughters now here she is i guess nine amen nine years old and wanting to give her heart and life to the lord jesus christ and accept him as her personal savior amen and be baptized amen let's give her a hand say thank you god bless you amen so i'll just read the scripture see i did i call the musicians up i i don't think we'll have a song i'm sorry y'all we're gonna go ahead and have the baptism and so i don't think we'll have a song right now okay um so turn your bibles if you will to acts if you will the book of acts you y'all can you all wanna say there or something okay yeah that's fine too if you wanna just stay there that's all right acts two hey man you'll have a closer view up here amen praise acts two all right how many knows that the way there's only one way that's christ in acts 4 and uh acts 4 verse verse which is come the head of the corner talking about jesus neither is there some salvation in any other for there is not another name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved peter preaching on the day of pentecost at verse 27 of chapter two says that when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call amen how may i we believe that one of these days the last one will come in and the work will be done amen i always think about it whenever we have one more baptism we say maybe this is the last one maybe this is the last one folks i'll tell you what if i wasn't baptized and wasn't saved and god would tug in my heart and somebody tell me hey that may be the last one i'd probably try to get up here in front of her yeah brother i need baptized i want to accept lord if that's the last one i sure don't want to be left out that right that's what it ought to do to us sinner said i want to be right i don't want to be left out amen if that's the last one i'm going to be the second to the last but i'm getting in amen you love him god bless you amen we're going to turn it over to um trustees and different ones if that were going to help maybe move this platform and so forth amen and brother steve just help us out here let me see brother will and i i don't know how we usually do it have a song maybe while we're doing it or something and some of us come up here and help get these things moved better by and so forth amen god bless you and grace elena go back there to the left oh [Music] i'm a child of the king he's raw your blood now flows through my veins and eyes he was praise god praise [Music] oh god oh yes praise god praise god i'm a child of the king once i was [Music] lost and
