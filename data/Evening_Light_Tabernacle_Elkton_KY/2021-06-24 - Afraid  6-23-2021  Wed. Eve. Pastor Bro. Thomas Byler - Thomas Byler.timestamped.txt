[48:58] service now in jesus christ's name
[49:00] amen and amen amen
[49:05] if you will this evening turn your
[49:07] bibles to the book of genesis
[49:10] genesis
[49:15] and my thought and my message came
[49:19] just thinking about adam
[49:22] and how that uh how did he was hiding in
[49:26] the bushes amen
[49:28] i got to thinking about adam hiding
[49:31] how did he got scared amen and so we
[49:34] want to talk about that
[49:35] scared tonight amen but we want to talk
[49:38] about being afraid
[49:39] titled it afraid amen
[49:44] so in genesis
[49:48] did i say one well it certainly isn't
[49:50] one
[49:52] uh let me see just where it is here
[49:56] seventh through 13. so
[50:00] it's probably
[50:06] huh two
[50:09] three all right thank you i don't know
[50:12] why i wrote
[50:12] genesis 1 down but that's what i did all
[50:24] right
[50:26] yes three and seven and the eyes of them
[50:29] both
[50:30] were opened and they knew that they were
[50:33] naked
[50:34] and they sewed fig leaves together and
[50:36] made themselves
[50:38] aprons and they heard the voice of the
[50:40] lord
[50:41] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[50:43] day
[50:44] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[50:48] from the presence of the lord god
[50:52] amongst the trees of the garden and the
[50:54] lord god
[50:55] called unto adam and said unto him
[50:59] where art thou and he said i heard thy
[51:02] voice in the garden
[51:04] and i was afraid
[51:08] because i was naked and hid myself
[51:13] and he said who told thee that thou was
[51:15] naked has thou eaten of the tree
[51:17] aware of i commanded thee that thou
[51:19] should is not
[51:20] and the man said the woman whom thou
[51:22] gave us to to be
[51:24] with me she gave me of the tree and i
[51:26] did eat
[51:27] and the lord god said unto the woman
[51:29] what is this that thou has done and the
[51:31] woman said the serpent
[51:32] beguiled me and i did eat
[51:37] amen may god had his blessings to
[51:39] reading in the words you can be seated
[51:41] now we all know that the genesis of
[51:43] course is the beginning
[51:45] chapter it is the seed chapter
[51:48] everything that you find in revelations
[51:51] you will find in the book of genesis
[51:53] isn't that right so as we talk about
[51:55] being afraid we talk about
[51:57] fear so tonight we're going to discuss
[52:00] fear
[52:01] we're going to talk about faith and also
[52:04] love
[52:05] but i want to talk about that being
[52:07] afraid
[52:09] now i don't want to get into this but i
[52:11] want to mention
[52:12] also that if you'll notice that
[52:15] after the fall it and this also carries
[52:20] you know right into our lives
[52:23] uh every man that is born of a woman of
[52:26] course i suppose this will be
[52:28] all the way to the end of time
[52:30] [Music]
[52:32] and that is the next two verses that we
[52:35] find in verse
[52:40] 13 no 12 and 13
[52:43] when he wanted a man to speak for
[52:46] himself and
[52:47] he asked you know you know what he had
[52:50] done what have you done
[52:53] okay and he said who told you that has
[52:56] eaten of the tree the man
[53:00] said the woman whom though we find that
[53:03] in the following
[53:05] condition of adam it is very
[53:09] hard amen and for
[53:12] for him to just confess his wrong
[53:15] uh what we call i guess passing the book
[53:19] am i right we as human beings we
[53:23] always like to try to blame somebody
[53:26] else isn't that right play the blame
[53:29] game
[53:30] you know and so the man here playing
[53:32] blamed the woman
[53:34] in that right and the woman wasn't any
[53:36] better than the man she's got the same
[53:38] problem she also
[53:40] had somebody that she could blame she
[53:42] says it was that serpent that's who it
[53:43] was
[53:44] it's his fault the man said it's a
[53:46] woman's fault woman said it's
[53:48] you know and so we find here that i
[53:51] believe if i'm not wrong probably god
[53:53] said he's seen a great miracle one time
[53:55] when a man come up and confess he says
[53:57] brother brandon i'm wrong
[54:00] i was wrong you know right
[54:03] amen when you hear that coming from
[54:05] somebody remember
[54:07] lights is flashing and miracles are
[54:10] taking place
[54:12] it's a miracle right because for us to
[54:14] actually
[54:15] take blame upon ourself you know
[54:18] it's just so hard for us to do
[54:22] amen i'm sure that i try to do it
[54:26] because i will say this i have heard in
[54:28] my lifetime
[54:30] being a pastor i have certainly heard it
[54:32] from people right
[54:34] when i know that it wasn't everybody
[54:36] else's fault but yet
[54:37] with everybody else's fault or somebody
[54:39] else's fault
[54:41] i mean i'm like a person just not really
[54:43] good at confessing
[54:45] you know when that's really the best
[54:46] thing for us to do is just to confess
[54:49] adam should have said yeah it's my fault
[54:52] don't blame my wife now
[54:53] i did it no it wasn't that way right
[54:56] and so anyway we find that that's the
[54:59] nature became the nature
[55:01] of man amen and so we find here that the
[55:05] very first
[55:06] thing you notice one of the very
[55:09] first things after the fall
[55:13] is that fear or being afraid
[55:18] came in now when you're afraid of
[55:22] something what is that another word for
[55:24] it would be
[55:25] scared you're scared
[55:29] the scary part of humanity
[55:32] begin to come out after the fall
[55:36] he was afraid let me tell you something
[55:39] people
[55:39] will hide behind all kinds of fig leaves
[55:43] they'll hide behind by all kinds of
[55:46] things
[55:46] because they don't want to hear the
[55:49] voice of the lord they're scared
[55:52] of the lord
[55:55] people don't want to come to church even
[55:57] because you know
[55:59] the lord might speak to him in that
[56:01] right
[56:02] and actually prick their conscience
[56:06] and tell them where they're wrong at
[56:08] people don't like to hear that they're
[56:09] scared of it
[56:10] because they're going to have to face
[56:12] the issue
[56:16] people don't want to face the issue
[56:19] amen so we find that
[56:23] coming from a place of perfection
[56:26] and now coming into another kind of a
[56:28] place no doubt but that adam and eve
[56:30] after they were driven from the garden
[56:33] perhaps they afterwards you know because
[56:36] we know that all of creation fell
[56:38] with adam isn't that right he was made
[56:40] the ruler over
[56:42] all the animals and so when the master
[56:44] of all the animals fell
[56:46] all the animals fell with their master
[56:51] and so they went out from the presence
[56:53] of the lord and
[56:54] amen and we find out that perhaps where
[56:57] he thought he could go
[56:58] up and rub a nice mane of about a
[57:02] lion we find out perhaps that he went
[57:04] out there and that
[57:05] that lion looked at him differently he
[57:08] growled at him and
[57:09] came running at him and next thing we
[57:11] might find is adam up in the tree and
[57:13] saying what the world's going on around
[57:15] here
[57:16] this guy tried to eat me
[57:20] why didn't all of a sudden fear came
[57:21] everywhere you know and every other
[57:24] and every other animal that perhaps was
[57:26] friendly now he isn't so friendly
[57:28] anymore
[57:29] fear fell upon all of creation
[57:34] amen it has become the scary part
[57:37] of all of humanity when that when that
[57:40] happened
[57:41] fear came amen now we know that the
[57:43] prophet taught us that there is
[57:44] absolutely nothing good
[57:46] no virtue no strength at all in fear
[57:51] in being afraid
[57:54] amen and you might be amazed i think if
[57:57] we all searched our hearts in life
[57:59] we might be afraid of how you know how
[58:02] how it gets right down to where we live
[58:05] a lot of times we might not testify to
[58:07] somebody because we're afraid of
[58:09] how they'll react amen
[58:12] we want to don't want to say nothing to
[58:14] the boss because he might say look if
[58:16] you're going to believe that you can't
[58:17] work here
[58:21] um all kinds of things
[58:24] amen we can think about but anyway
[58:29] so we look at that and we realize that
[58:31] is actually
[58:32] it is a state of existence this being is
[58:35] this being afraid
[58:37] is a state of existence it's like an
[58:40] atmosphere
[58:42] being afraid is an atmosphere that a
[58:44] person lives in that
[58:46] is a horrible place to live it'll cause
[58:48] you to go hide
[58:50] frame and hide it'll cause you to blame
[58:52] everybody else it's
[58:54] it's just a lot of things that is
[58:56] terrible about this word being
[58:59] afraid
[59:02] amen it's the opposite of confidence
[59:07] all right when you uh you know
[59:11] if you don't you know if your heart is
[59:13] right with god then do you have
[59:14] confidence
[59:16] in that right that god will answer your
[59:17] prayer the bible said
[59:19] but there cannot be any condemnation the
[59:22] reason that adam had condemnation and
[59:25] the reason that he had fear in the
[59:26] beginning
[59:27] was because he broke one of god's
[59:29] commandments he did something
[59:31] that was wrong
[59:34] i'll tell you what how many knows
[59:36] anytime you do something that is wrong
[59:38] it hurts your confidence with god it
[59:41] hurts your walk
[59:42] with god
[59:46] amen that's what he did he had broke one
[59:49] of his commandments his confidence went
[59:51] he was afraid he was con
[59:53] condemnation come in
[59:56] amen the confidence went out and all
[59:58] kinds of
[59:59] things now notice here i want to say
[1:00:01] this that amen this place of being
[1:00:03] afraid is
[1:00:04] actual and fear it's a place of
[1:00:07] uncertainty
[1:00:10] it's not sure it's uncertain
[1:00:14] he didn't know what was going to happen
[1:00:17] it's unsolid and shaky place to be
[1:00:22] is in a place of fear or being scared
[1:00:26] it's a place of sinking sand
[1:00:29] amen i like the song we sang on christ
[1:00:32] the
[1:00:32] silent rock i said all underground
[1:00:35] sinking sand the only thing that oh my
[1:00:39] you think about this we're gonna take it
[1:00:40] a little bit but we go in here we find
[1:00:42] that all of this was brought in
[1:00:44] amen one of the first things it was that
[1:00:47] he was afraid
[1:00:49] amen praise the lord
[1:00:52] and you know the whole world is afraid
[1:00:57] the whole world has it's bound by fear
[1:01:04] and i told my wife on the way i said
[1:01:06] write this down people
[1:01:08] react and act and they don't even know
[1:01:11] why they're acting like they
[1:01:13] are but for the most part it's because
[1:01:18] they're scared people around the world
[1:01:21] are scared
[1:01:25] they might not even confess it they
[1:01:27] might not say it but they are
[1:01:30] because you see folks you might block it
[1:01:32] out of your mind you might block it away
[1:01:34] but way
[1:01:35] down in here god has made us as human
[1:01:38] beings
[1:01:39] to know something is that right and that
[1:01:42] is to know that we're going to come to a
[1:01:44] place of death
[1:01:47] brother bambi said he's heard people
[1:01:48] brag and boast and make all kinds of
[1:01:50] statements but when they come down to
[1:01:52] the door of death
[1:01:53] it was a different story isn't that
[1:01:56] right
[1:01:57] because he knows that he's got to go he
[1:01:59] knows he's going to make
[1:02:01] meet his maker and there's something
[1:02:03] that in there that is scary about
[1:02:06] that everybody that doesn't have christ
[1:02:09] is in a place of being scared
[1:02:14] a place of not having any confidence
[1:02:18] a place of fear of what the future holds
[1:02:23] amen oh my
[1:02:28] and i want to say that that the place of
[1:02:31] perfection
[1:02:32] is to live in the absence of fear
[1:02:36] to live in the absence of fear is the
[1:02:40] place
[1:02:41] of perfection
[1:02:46] wow
[1:02:49] that we can live in a place that has
[1:02:52] absolutely no
[1:02:54] scare not even death itself
[1:02:58] scares you how many knows we've had
[1:03:02] great examples of it
[1:03:04] ff bosworth different ones it came down
[1:03:06] to that
[1:03:07] place of death and they weren't scared
[1:03:09] paul
[1:03:10] the apostle paul isn't that right see
[1:03:13] all the way
[1:03:14] up till the time of jesus christ coming
[1:03:17] to the earth
[1:03:18] the bible talks one place about men were
[1:03:20] always their lifelong
[1:03:22] and they always had that fear of death
[1:03:25] that fear of death was always there the
[1:03:27] only thing that took that fear and sting
[1:03:29] of
[1:03:30] death away was jesus christ
[1:03:34] and one one way to get rid of that is of
[1:03:36] course and that is to be
[1:03:38] right with god adam was no longer right
[1:03:42] with god
[1:03:42] and he had every reason to be scared
[1:03:46] let me tell you something anybody that
[1:03:48] don't have a christ
[1:03:49] in their hearts you have every reason to
[1:03:52] be scared
[1:03:53] if you're not right with god tonight
[1:03:55] remember you ought to be
[1:03:57] very afraid
[1:04:01] you ought to be very scared
[1:04:05] amen because the future doesn't look so
[1:04:09] good
[1:04:11] judgment waits hell and the second death
[1:04:15] await amen you should be very scared
[1:04:20] if you're not right with god just as
[1:04:22] adam and eve were scared
[1:04:24] because they weren't right with god paul
[1:04:28] said therefore having access
[1:04:30] to god by faith we have peace with god
[1:04:32] isn't that right
[1:04:34] being justified so forth jesus christ
[1:04:36] made that available
[1:04:38] let me tell you a story i want to base
[1:04:39] my thought tonight on
[1:04:42] about the little boy going by the
[1:04:43] graveyard remember the story
[1:04:46] so now brother bam says look at the days
[1:04:48] of lot the perversion the homosexuals
[1:04:50] oh how the world the whole country most
[1:04:53] of the government swallowed up with it
[1:04:55] and everywhere
[1:04:56] we're meeting lord by devils and power
[1:04:58] of the enemy
[1:04:59] the whole world is scared to death
[1:05:05] even our nation is like a little boy
[1:05:08] going through a graveyard at night
[1:05:10] whistling to keep himself from being
[1:05:12] afraid
[1:05:14] actually trying to act like he is not
[1:05:16] afraid
[1:05:18] amen but he knows that he is
[1:05:21] amen another place now we realize lord
[1:05:24] that something is fixing to happen the
[1:05:26] world knows it
[1:05:27] they're singing songs and television are
[1:05:30] bursting forth
[1:05:32] with neurotical jokes and songs what are
[1:05:35] they doing they're like a little boy
[1:05:36] whistling in the dark passing by a
[1:05:38] graveyard scared to death
[1:05:40] trying to soothe his nerves by whistling
[1:05:44] he's only fooling himself
[1:05:46] so is it with this nation and the world
[1:05:49] how many knows that that's what all in
[1:05:50] the whole world i guess
[1:05:52] so everything is ever about a joke
[1:05:54] everything is about laughing they're
[1:05:56] just joking
[1:05:57] trying to soothe that fear that's down
[1:06:00] in there
[1:06:02] trying to get it out of their mind
[1:06:03] trying to get it out of their mind
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:09] oh my why do you think that
[1:06:13] our government and our world is trying
[1:06:16] to get rid of christianity
[1:06:18] and everything that's right they're
[1:06:21] scared
[1:06:23] they fight it with everything i mean
[1:06:24] they go out of their way
[1:06:26] to try to make sure that we get rid of
[1:06:27] this and get rid of that isn't that
[1:06:29] right
[1:06:29] take the ten commandments out take
[1:06:31] prayer they're scared
[1:06:34] they're just scared they don't want to
[1:06:36] have to they don't want to bother them
[1:06:38] but it does bother
[1:06:39] them amen
[1:06:42] they are scared internally
[1:06:46] they're scared but they may not even
[1:06:47] admit it but they are
[1:06:49] because they know they're going to
[1:06:52] answer
[1:06:53] on the day of judgment amen
[1:06:57] they know they got it coming this nation
[1:07:00] knows

[1:07:24] as long as god's around they're going to
[1:07:26] hear it
[1:07:28] why do you think they want to get rid of
[1:07:29] us they don't want to hurt but they're
[1:07:30] scared
[1:07:31] because they know that it's the truth

[1:14:19] shaky scary place
[1:14:26] amen i visited
[1:14:29] visited my old bishop i think he was the
[1:14:32] bishop when i was amish
[1:14:33] he's not anymore he's way too old his
[1:14:36] wife done died one of his sons died
[1:14:39] and he reminded me when i went into his
[1:14:41] house
[1:14:43] to visit him a lot like my mom's
[1:14:46] a lot like amish houses when you go in
[1:14:49] there there's no
[1:14:51] gospel music playing
[1:14:56] about as quiet as what you hear right
[1:14:58] here just quiet
[1:15:01] but up on the mantle somewhere on the
[1:15:03] wall
[1:15:04] they'll all have a clock they'll have a
[1:15:07] clock
[1:15:09] and what you'll hear in the quietness
[1:15:12] is that clock tick tock tick tock
[1:15:16] tick tock tick tock tick
[1:15:20] it's almost scary it's almost spooky
[1:15:23] huh like tick tock
[1:15:26] and i got to thinking about on this here
[1:15:28] i said you know it's
[1:15:29] you know even the sound of a clock
[1:15:33] is scary you know why
[1:15:37] because the prophet said every time he
[1:15:38] goes dick
[1:15:40] huh you only got so many ticks
[1:15:44] in your life one time it'll go talk
[1:15:48] and it'll stop huh
[1:15:52] you only have so much so many tick tocks
[1:15:54] so many seconds in your life
[1:15:56] and then you got to go meet the master
[1:15:59] and there i was listening to the tick
[1:16:01] tock tick tock
[1:16:03] talking to him fellowship and therefore
[1:16:04] different things
[1:16:06] and he's not quite there all in his mind
[1:16:08] so sometimes he's with you sometimes
[1:16:10] he's not

[1:16:13] still up here

[1:16:16] kept talking and wanting to go down oh i
[1:16:18] don't know why i'm still here talk about
[1:16:21] spooky
[1:16:22] fellowship right there talk this man's
[1:16:25] wanting to die here
[1:16:28] he's wanting to go he don't want to have
[1:16:30] him be scroobled up and all just sitting

[1:16:45] want to be like fs bothers or some of
[1:16:47] the brothers that said who's dying here

[1:16:52] the curtains and so forth
[1:16:54] maybe get to see my loved ones how many
[1:16:56] you don't have to die in fear
[1:16:58] fear that doesn't have to be scary when
[1:17:01] you're ready
[1:17:03] why because christ took this thing of
[1:17:05] death
[1:17:06] out you don't have fear anymore
[1:17:10] all right
[1:17:13] let's think about something else do you
[1:17:15] realize that fear
[1:17:16] is a weapon that is used
[1:17:20] in the military fear
[1:17:24] is that right called i guess it's called
[1:17:27] shock and awe shock and awe
[1:17:31] i think hitler used it overwhelming
[1:17:34] force until it just takes swat
[1:17:36] it takes the spirit out of the enemy in
[1:17:39] other words
[1:17:42] just knock them back and they got no
[1:17:44] more spirit to fight with
[1:17:46] feared on set in they are going to who
[1:17:49] of us
[1:17:50] hello i hope you knows when you've got
[1:17:52] that idea in your mind
[1:17:53] they've whooped you right there
[1:17:56] then i whooped ya one day you believe
[1:17:59] that you're whooped
[1:18:00] because you're not gonna have the muscle
[1:18:01] to fight
[1:18:03] amen let me tell you something that's
[1:18:05] what happens to christians sometimes
[1:18:07] the devil will hit you with a trial
[1:18:10] he'll hit you something so hard
[1:18:12] that if you aren't careful you'll let
[1:18:14] fear come in
[1:18:17] instead of the love of god and just let
[1:18:19] god handle it and god allows the enemy
[1:18:21] to shock and always a lot of times
[1:18:23] like he did at the red sea you're like
[1:18:26] oh man here we
[1:18:27] see the chariots coming and it was
[1:18:29] shocking all until they
[1:18:31] didn't say well you know though he's
[1:18:33] playing me
[1:18:35] yet i'll trust him huh that's where he
[1:18:38] should have stayed
[1:18:39] shut in with god but they didn't they
[1:18:42] let that fear grab a hold of them
[1:18:44] and then they went and acted according
[1:18:46] to their fear
[1:18:48] according to their scare god allows us
[1:18:51] to get scared
[1:18:52] joke look at job he could have been
[1:18:54] scared he was in shock and all with what
[1:18:56] hit him
[1:18:58] but by god's grace he maintained his
[1:19:00] testimony
[1:19:01] the lord gave the lord taken away
[1:19:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:19:09] one example of shock and awe
[1:19:12] was with the rahab the harlot jericho
[1:19:15] how many knows jericho was a mighty city
[1:19:17] they come into the promised land the
[1:19:19] first city they come into
[1:19:20] they were running chariot races up on
[1:19:22] top of the walls
[1:19:23] that's a big old wall folks even these
[1:19:27] children of israel
[1:19:28] amen those spies that went into that
[1:19:30] land and they said we're like
[1:19:31] grasshoppers to them
[1:19:35] huh
[1:19:39] let me change the story for a second
[1:19:40] since it comes to my mind is that all
[1:19:42] right
[1:19:45] when when this tactic is used when
[1:19:47] somebody has the opposite of fear
[1:19:50] and has courage
[1:19:54] and that is brave because fear
[1:19:57] brings cowardice right you become a
[1:20:00] coward
[1:20:01] when you have fear in your life
[1:20:06] and one illustration of a
[1:20:10] army that let me just say this courage
[1:20:14] if you can have courage and bring fear
[1:20:17] into the
[1:20:17] enemy the enemy can be much much
[1:20:20] greater than you
[1:20:23] and yet because fear strikes the heart
[1:20:26] of that enemy
[1:20:27] you could actually overcome the much
[1:20:30] greater army
[1:20:31] simply because of your care your uh
[1:20:34] courage
[1:20:35] and the fear that is put in them
[1:20:38] that right the illustration that you'll
[1:20:41] remember when i refer to this
[1:20:42] is that the swiss but about talked about
[1:20:44] the swiss how they were
[1:20:46] never had much of a military or anything
[1:20:48] but a great big army with
[1:20:50] all their spears and oh man totally
[1:20:53] trained
[1:20:54] that they might come up with a great
[1:20:56] wall against the swiss
[1:20:58] and arnold bond and i can't pronounce
[1:21:01] that last name but i'm gonna call him
[1:21:02] arnold remember that
[1:21:04] and he went out there and he says to his
[1:21:05] friends and his neighbors he says look
[1:21:07] today i give my life for my country
[1:21:11] now right y'all remember that i'll never
[1:21:13] see my wife i'll never see my kids again
[1:21:16] but let me know that we're going to
[1:21:18] fight for
[1:21:19] freedom isn't that right he says i'm
[1:21:22] going to give my life and he took
[1:21:24] and he ran towards that great big army
[1:21:27] and he ran
[1:21:28] into them and they all put their spears
[1:21:30] out
[1:21:31] and they're right and he said he grabbed
[1:21:34] a bunch of them
[1:21:35] and probably put a bunch of grabbed a
[1:21:36] bunch of them and said
[1:21:38] make way for liberty
[1:21:42] it scared the devil out of them
[1:21:45] enemy and that right put the fear of god
[1:21:47] in them shall i say
[1:21:49] and brother bob said they routed that
[1:21:51] into that enemy
[1:21:52] they never came back with the swiss
[1:21:54] because what did it do
[1:21:56] it gave his people courage it didn't
[1:21:59] matter if they had a pitchfork or an
[1:22:00] action what they had they went in there
[1:22:03] and it put fear
[1:22:06] in that army it scared
[1:22:09] that army and then it was routed
[1:22:12] i mean that's when we're routed that's
[1:22:14] when we're defeated
[1:22:16] when we let the devil scare us
[1:22:20] a lot of times we'll get upset we'll get
[1:22:22] mad because things begin to go
[1:22:24] a complete different direction than what
[1:22:27] our
[1:22:28] what we're used to having as stability
[1:22:30] is that right
[1:22:32] and when we let fear come in many times
[1:22:34] we'll get mad because
[1:22:35] i mean we want control of the situation
[1:22:39] because we like to have control in that
[1:22:41] right
[1:22:43] and any of us it can happen to any of us
[1:22:45] is that right
[1:22:47] when that happens a situation to where
[1:22:50] men in shock and all we're not used
[1:22:52] to it and you gotta really relax and say
[1:22:54] lord help me
[1:22:55] amen all right so that's one instance
[1:23:00] of where fear was put into the heart
[1:23:03] of a great army and the other incident
[1:23:07] was here in the bible
[1:23:09] when remember that spies went in and
[1:23:12] their rahab the harlot
[1:23:13] they got caught inside the gates in that
[1:23:16] right i believe it is
[1:23:17] and they couldn't get out anymore and
[1:23:20] they were going to find these spies and
[1:23:23] build out kill them
[1:23:26] ray had the harlot had a revelation
[1:23:29] and verse 7 of chapter 2 of joshua says
[1:23:31] and the men pursued them
[1:23:33] by the way of jordan
[1:23:36] hold on a minute
[1:23:41] yeah she told him they had left i guess
[1:23:42] hey they don't got out of here go get
[1:23:44] him
[1:23:44] find him all right and as soon as they
[1:23:46] were pursuing after them and were going
[1:23:48] out they shut the gate
[1:23:49] and before they were laid down she came
[1:23:52] up unto them
[1:23:53] upon the roof and she said until the man
[1:23:55] i know that the lord has given you the
[1:23:57] land
[1:23:58] and that your terror is falling upon
[1:24:02] us oh my i'll tell you what if we could
[1:24:05] get that terror to fall on the devil he
[1:24:07] would leave our premises
[1:24:09] huh and that all the inhabitants of the
[1:24:12] land
[1:24:13] faint because of you
[1:24:17] they became weak for we have heard how
[1:24:20] the lord
[1:24:21] dried up the water of the red sea for
[1:24:23] you
[1:24:26] how many how many knows what are the
[1:24:28] things that you hear
[1:24:30] can really take you down sometimes you
[1:24:32] got to make sure what you hear and what
[1:24:33] you listen to
[1:24:35] amen jehoshaphat i believe it was when
[1:24:38] the enemy came in and wrote him letters
[1:24:40] that he ought to just surrender and
[1:24:41] spare life and all of these other stuff
[1:24:43] and
[1:24:43] he said all the things they're going to
[1:24:44] do and then jehoshaphat boy he didn't
[1:24:46] know what to do but he turned to the
[1:24:48] lord and a prayer
[1:24:49] and they're right god says don't be
[1:24:51] afraid
[1:24:52] you have good courage all right when you
[1:24:54] came out
[1:24:55] out of egypt and what you did unto the
[1:24:57] two kings of the amorites
[1:24:59] that were on the other side of jordan
[1:25:01] zion and og
[1:25:03] who he utterly destroyed
[1:25:06] and as soon as we heard these things
[1:25:10] our hearts did melt
[1:25:14] oh we were big bad and brave but when we
[1:25:17] heard
[1:25:18] that our hearts melted
[1:25:23] folks don't never let your heart
[1:25:26] melt because of fear or because of
[1:25:30] something that happens
[1:25:31] things happen all through life amen
[1:25:37] neither did there remain any more
[1:25:40] courage in any man
[1:25:43] they lost the war right there
[1:25:47] they lost their courage because of you
[1:25:51] for the lord your god he is god in
[1:25:54] heaven above
[1:25:55] and on the earth beneath amen
[1:25:59] notice what god told him this was
[1:26:01] chapter 2 of joshua
[1:26:02] chapter 1 of joshua god was telling
[1:26:05] joshua
[1:26:06] he says verse 6 to be there shall not be
[1:26:09] able to be any man stand before thee all
[1:26:11] the days of the life
[1:26:12] as i was with moses so will i be with
[1:26:14] thee amen
[1:26:16] kind of remind me of what jesus told us
[1:26:18] amen fear not
[1:26:19] i am with thee i'll never leave thee nor
[1:26:21] life for safety
[1:26:22] how many believes that that god is with
[1:26:25] you he promised never to leave you
[1:26:27] never to forsake you fear
[1:26:30] not we have to be
[1:26:33] absence of the presence of fear
[1:26:36] in order to be the kind of christian
[1:26:38] that we ought to be
[1:26:40] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:26:42] but be strong
[1:26:43] and of good courage amen verse 7
[1:26:46] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:26:49] that thou mayest observe to do all
[1:26:51] according to the law
[1:26:53] my uh which moses my servant commanded
[1:26:55] thee turn not from the right or to the
[1:26:57] left amen
[1:26:59] so he says listen be strong and be very
[1:27:02] courageous i mean let me just make a
[1:27:05] reference to it because i want to
[1:27:07] cover more tonight in a short space but
[1:27:09] another place
[1:27:10] uh in the bible we find that whenever
[1:27:14] jesus went up into a mountain to pray
[1:27:15] and so forth amen and the disciples were
[1:27:18] in a boat
[1:27:18] isn't that right and in about the fourth
[1:27:20] watch of the night which i believe is
[1:27:22] between
[1:27:22] three and six o'clock in the morning if
[1:27:24] i'm not wrong amen jesus
[1:27:27] amen while he was up there the wind
[1:27:29] became
[1:27:30] contrary and the boat began to go way
[1:27:33] out in the ocean isn't that right
[1:27:36] and he come walking on the water he
[1:27:38] couldn't get in there maybe anymore but
[1:27:40] he come
[1:27:40] walking on the water the bible says that
[1:27:42] they were
[1:27:43] scared they were afraid they were
[1:27:46] frightened because
[1:27:48] huh what is this israel
[1:27:52] are you far sincere
[1:27:56] is this good or is this bad and jesus
[1:27:58] said
[1:27:59] what he says fear not
[1:28:02] be of good courage amen it is i
[1:28:05] he said be not afraid it is i
[1:28:10] the brother brandon preached that
[1:28:12] message called it is i be not afraid
[1:28:14] and he said that's how this generation
[1:28:16] of church people
[1:28:18] when they see the discernment the
[1:28:20] thoughts of the heart and so forth jesus
[1:28:22] coming doing exactly what he did
[1:28:24] he says don't think that it's beelzebub
[1:28:26] for mental telepathy or some devil
[1:28:28] it's not it is i be not afraid
[1:28:32] i'm at least that's what we had in this
[1:28:34] generation jesus coming into the same
[1:28:36] situation
[1:28:37] and people thought it was some spooky
[1:28:39] scary thing
[1:28:41] oh you can just read the minds he can't
[1:28:44] read nothing it's jesus christ he's
[1:28:46] earning the thoughts and defense of the
[1:28:47] heart
[1:28:48] amen and they were afraid of it
[1:28:52] my in that right so be not afraid
[1:28:56] it is i
[1:29:00] don't be afraid
[1:29:05] amen i trust that it's the place that
[1:29:08] each and everybody here if you aren't
[1:29:11] there yet let's get there
[1:29:13] get to the place to where you don't have
[1:29:15] to be
[1:29:16] afraid amen
[1:29:23] i was thinking about it having been a
[1:29:26] nightmare
[1:29:28] folks how many knows a nightmare is
[1:29:30] scary
[1:29:32] it's scary you try to wake up from it
[1:29:38] and i'll say this on my part i believe
[1:29:40] that up till the time of christ the
[1:29:41] whole world was in the nightmare
[1:29:44] the only thing that changed the dream
[1:29:46] was jesus christ
[1:29:49] all of a sudden it turned it wasn't so
[1:29:51] scary anymore
[1:29:53] the devil wasn't so scary anymore the
[1:29:56] bee that stings and
[1:29:57] of death it wasn't so scary anymore
[1:30:01] it became a whole lot nicer amen to
[1:30:04] where you had
[1:30:05] fear now you have fellowship you have
[1:30:08] faith isn't that right
[1:30:11] but in another way let me tell you what
[1:30:13] brother branham said
[1:30:15] he says that ever since he got borned
[1:30:17] again it seems like he was in a
[1:30:19] nightmare
[1:30:21] because while we were out there when
[1:30:23] you're in the world
[1:30:25] drinking and partying and all that other
[1:30:27] stuff you know you just fit in you
[1:30:28] didn't think about nothing you just went
[1:30:30] with the world
[1:30:31] it's what you did he didn't think it was
[1:30:33] so bad
[1:30:35] but when you try to live and be a
[1:30:37] christian in this world
[1:30:39] all of a sudden that is a nightmare out
[1:30:41] there that right
[1:30:44] i was speaking with my wife this morning
[1:30:46] i told her i said
[1:30:47] we was talking about death and i said
[1:30:49] since i got saved 30 years ago as a boy
[1:30:52] ever since then it seems like i'm in a
[1:30:55] nightmare
[1:30:58] she says what do you mean amen and i
[1:31:02] said
[1:31:02] in this life something has happened down
[1:31:04] in me that makes me know
[1:31:06] that there is a land somewhere amen
[1:31:09] but we can stop there some right there
[1:31:11] on the somewhere there's a land
[1:31:12] somewhere
[1:31:13] that doesn't have what we have to deal
[1:31:16] with
[1:31:17] are you with me tonight and we don't
[1:31:20] have to see
[1:31:20] all this and we don't have to fight all
[1:31:22] this
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:27] oh my that we don't have to live in
[1:31:29] satan's
[1:31:31] heaven hello is that okay
[1:31:34] can i say it that way we're living in
[1:31:36] the devil's heaven
[1:31:40] and the devil is i'm gonna just kind of
[1:31:42] go down the side road but hopefully
[1:31:44] all right this is the devil is fixing to
[1:31:47] be
[1:31:47] in the pinnacle of his dream
[1:31:52] of his goal according to isaiah 14
[1:31:56] who he says i will be like the most high
[1:31:59] i will be worshipped
[1:32:00] i will be like god and brother brahma
[1:32:02] says all the denominational churches
[1:32:04] when they rejected jesus christ when he
[1:32:07] came this and this generation
[1:32:09] they accepted the devil's theology they
[1:32:11] would take
[1:32:12] what their bible school told them over
[1:32:15] the proven vindicated word of god they
[1:32:18] took it over that
[1:32:19] and by doing so he said they exalted
[1:32:21] satan to the place that he always
[1:32:23] wanted to be
[1:32:27] amen and it never happened
[1:32:30] never has happened until this generation
[1:32:33] world over and now every
[1:32:36] because you're either serving god or the
[1:32:38] devil it all depends on what you believe
[1:32:40] that's why the mark of the beast is
[1:32:41] either in the head what you believe or
[1:32:43] what you partake of
[1:32:45] amen that means who you fellowship what
[1:32:47] you partake of is what you're guilty of
[1:32:49] and what you believe amen
[1:32:53] he's coming to the pinnacle of it
[1:32:56] amen and we call it satan's
[1:32:59] eden satan's
[1:33:02] eden we're living in satan's eden
[1:33:06] amen and i'll tell you what
[1:33:11] they might like it but i don't no sir
[1:33:15] we as christians we don't like it
[1:33:19] i'll tell you what
[1:33:23] the people way people do you know
[1:33:27] it's just well it just can't get hardly
[1:33:29] any worse
[1:33:31] we keep saying that don't we then it
[1:33:32] gets a little worse
[1:33:35] oh my so let me finish the story
[1:33:41] lets me know there's a land somewhere
[1:33:42] and i'm shaking myself
[1:33:44] to wake up someday oh my
[1:33:48] get me out of here this is not where i
[1:33:51] belong
[1:33:52] oh i like that this is not where i
[1:33:56] belong
[1:33:59] this is not where you belong
[1:34:08] death now notice someday death will wake
[1:34:11] me
[1:34:12] into his presence did you ever have a
[1:34:15] nightmare
[1:34:15] you just wanted to get out of it and you
[1:34:18] were jerking and jumping
[1:34:19] you want to wake up because you know
[1:34:21] there's a reality somewhere
[1:34:23] that's far beyond that nightmare
[1:34:29] that's what he said this was where we're
[1:34:31] living in
[1:34:33] question does anybody think of something
[1:34:36] else that brother branham referred to
[1:34:38] what this world was like
[1:34:43] something burning
[1:34:49] what that's right smoldering
[1:34:53] burning garbage pile
[1:34:57] that's what this world's like remember
[1:35:00] he said that's what he's like
[1:35:02] and everywhere if you ever heard him
[1:35:05] describe a
[1:35:05] really really really nasty bathroom i
[1:35:08] believe it was
[1:35:09] one that you just closed the door and
[1:35:11] you you go outside and wipe your feet
[1:35:14] i don't even want to wear whatever i
[1:35:16] don't want what's on the bottom of my
[1:35:18] feet
[1:35:18] my dudes he said that's also what it's
[1:35:21] like
[1:35:22] an abomination everywhere
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:30] everywhere that's what the world's like
[1:35:34] i want to get out of this nightmare it's
[1:35:36] scary
[1:35:38] it's scary they're defunding the police
[1:35:42] and that's kind of scary
[1:35:46] oh my they're turning all the people
[1:35:48] that do something wrong they're turning
[1:35:49] them right back loose
[1:35:51] it's getting scary you might not think
[1:35:54] so much of sitting here today we're out
[1:35:56] in rural areas
[1:35:59] but you gave it some time folks when you
[1:36:02] got to watch out your window
[1:36:06] wondering who's going to come walking in
[1:36:08] or
[1:36:10] when you're going to have to when you're
[1:36:13] going to have to think of people that
[1:36:14] you don't know coming to your property
[1:36:16] as somebody that's going to kill you
[1:36:19] because that's the only way that you
[1:36:21] know that's why you're going to have to
[1:36:22] look at it
[1:36:23] because you don't know it's sad this
[1:36:26] world is a bad place getting to be a bad
[1:36:28] place to live
[1:36:30] amen but uh all right let's turn to
[1:36:36] thought for a little bit shall we let's
[1:36:38] find out how we can get rid of
[1:36:41] fear get rid of fear
[1:36:46] the bible says that you're not perfect
[1:36:49] as long as you have fear
[1:36:52] would you like the scripture all right
[1:36:55] let's go into a
[1:36:56] and i want to say this in first
[1:36:58] corinthians the 13th chapter
[1:37:01] and verse 13 it says now by the faith
[1:37:04] paul says when it's all said and done
[1:37:06] what abides
[1:37:07] is faith hope and charity
[1:37:11] love right let's talk about that for a
[1:37:14] few minutes first john
[1:37:20] if you're gonna go with me go with me to
[1:37:22] first john
[1:37:24] excuse me four
[1:37:34] and verse 17 herein is
[1:37:37] our love made perfect that we may have
[1:37:40] boldness
[1:37:41] in the day of judgment because as he is
[1:37:43] so are we in this world
[1:37:44] there is no fear
[1:37:48] in love
[1:37:52] no fear in love
[1:37:56] what about if somebody comes up and
[1:37:57] smacks you what about when somebody
[1:38:00] trespasses against you when somebody
[1:38:04] does your own huh
[1:38:10] wow there is no fear
[1:38:14] in love but perfect
[1:38:17] love casts out
[1:38:21] fear how many knows that adam
[1:38:25] lost the love of god when he stepped out
[1:38:28] like he did
[1:38:29] that's why he was scared because he
[1:38:32] wouldn't have been scared if he had the
[1:38:33] perfect love of god in his heart
[1:38:37] because fear hath what
[1:38:40] torment it's not comfort
[1:38:44] there's nothing good about it
[1:38:48] even in the hearts of the enemy they
[1:38:50] were weak
[1:38:51] didn't have any courage left it wasn't
[1:38:53] anything good it was not strength
[1:38:56] all right fear hath torment he
[1:38:59] that feareth is not me perfecting love
[1:39:02] that's where i get my statement
[1:39:04] if you have fear you're still not made
[1:39:07] perfect
[1:39:07] in love that's why most of the time we
[1:39:11] do stuff
[1:39:13] it's because of fear it's amazing how
[1:39:16] much
[1:39:16] we operate a lot of times because we're
[1:39:18] scared of something
[1:39:21] rather than just having love if somebody
[1:39:25] does you wrong and you just love
[1:39:27] those that despitefully use you huh
[1:39:31] they'll never dismay you
[1:39:34] this make you
[1:39:37] in joshua i believe it's chapter 8 god
[1:39:41] tells joshua
[1:39:42] fear not neither be dismayed
[1:39:47] no matter how big the walls are don't be
[1:39:50] dismayed no by how big your giant is
[1:39:53] doctor tells you you god can't don't be
[1:39:55] dismayed
[1:39:56] if you're in the love of god just stay
[1:39:58] in the love of god
[1:40:00] is that right how many knows that's the
[1:40:03] most powerful weapon there is
[1:40:05] to overcome everything is the love of
[1:40:08] god in your heart
[1:40:13] folks somebody smites you on the cheek
[1:40:16] and boy you just want to punch him back
[1:40:19] it's hard not to huh
[1:40:23] if you don't have the love of god in
[1:40:24] your heart you probably will you're not
[1:40:26] strong enough
[1:40:28] not to see it takes a stronger person
[1:40:31] not to
[1:40:32] than it does to do it
[1:40:38] that's right that's why jesus said love
[1:40:41] your enemies
[1:40:42] pray for them to despitefully use you
[1:40:45] and that right
[1:40:47] you know give that to him that asks if
[1:40:49] you when somebody compels you to go mile
[1:40:51] go the extra mile he says be ye perfect
[1:40:55] even as your heavenly father is perfect
[1:40:59] can you imagine what would have happened
[1:41:00] to the pharisees if jesus would have
[1:41:02] gotten mad
[1:41:05] don't call me a devil you know
[1:41:12] huh you ain't gonna know me that way
[1:41:15] i'll tell you what
[1:41:16] boy can you imagine what he could have
[1:41:18] done but he always kept his cool
[1:41:20] he always just said love for him he told
[1:41:23] him he told them the thing
[1:41:26] but guess what jesus never allowed fear
[1:41:29] to come into his heart
[1:41:31] jesus had no fear our heavenly father
[1:41:33] has no fear he's not scared
[1:41:35] of anything
[1:41:41] amen
[1:41:45] and we love him because he first
[1:41:48] loved us and if anybody say i love god
[1:41:52] and hates his brother he's a liar
[1:41:56] huh if you if you could hate
[1:42:00] anybody something wrong with your heart
[1:42:04] that's quite something that perfect how
[1:42:06] many knows that perfect love has to be
[1:42:08] in there
[1:42:10] now we know that faith is great in that
[1:42:12] character why
[1:42:13] faith is really great because it gives
[1:42:15] us access to what
[1:42:17] it gives us access to god which is love
[1:42:22] you know and so i use a tool to get
[1:42:24] something the tool isn't so much the
[1:42:26] greatest one
[1:42:27] it's what i got with the tool am i right
[1:42:30] that's why paul said you have hope faith
[1:42:32] love but the greatest of these is love
[1:42:34] because
[1:42:35] faith gives you access unto god gives
[1:42:37] you access into this love
[1:42:42] amen let me tell you something if
[1:42:45] anybody has a problem with god or
[1:42:47] doing what they got what god wants them
[1:42:49] to do there's only one solution and that
[1:42:51] is to fall in love with god
[1:42:54] deeper
[1:42:56] amen
[1:43:05] because it is the most powerful force
[1:43:08] i'll compare the love of god to the love
[1:43:10] of a mother
[1:43:12] remember one time there was a house on
[1:43:14] fire
[1:43:16] and the firemen couldn't even go into
[1:43:18] the house anymore
[1:43:20] there was a mother outside
[1:43:23] and they says no you can't go in there
[1:43:26] it's too hot and she did it anyway
[1:43:30] she went into a house that was burning
[1:43:34] and she went up there and got her little
[1:43:36] baby huh
[1:43:38] she loved that baby so much she ran into
[1:43:41] that fire
[1:43:42] got completely disfigured am i right
[1:43:47] but she didn't mind it that was my baby
[1:43:50] folks the love of god will make you run
[1:43:52] into flames
[1:43:54] burning houses what will it do with you
[1:43:57] if you've got the love of god in your
[1:43:58] heart you sure ain't going to hate
[1:43:59] people hate your brother
[1:44:03] and so forth brother brandon one time he
[1:44:07] talked about how that he was out in the
[1:44:08] middle of that field
[1:44:09] and a killer bull they had put a killer
[1:44:11] bull in there and he was crossing over
[1:44:13] to go pray for somebody
[1:44:14] he left a it's a game board and he left
[1:44:16] his gun in the truck
[1:44:17] isn't that right and this killer bull
[1:44:20] raised up and he didn't just remember
[1:44:22] then
[1:44:22] oh yeah they put a killer bull in here
[1:44:24] there's no trees
[1:44:25] the fence is way too far that bull is
[1:44:27] stomping his feet and he's coming after
[1:44:29] me
[1:44:30] now let me ask you this what did brother
[1:44:32] bottom have did he have faith i'm going
[1:44:33] to have
[1:44:34] faith to move mountains here
[1:44:38] was it faith not what he said he says he
[1:44:41] felt the love of god come down over him
[1:44:44] he says he was no more scared than
[1:44:47] anything
[1:44:49] no more fear of death because at first
[1:44:51] he reached for the gun
[1:44:53] he's going to take care of it himself
[1:44:54] i'll take care of his problem i may have
[1:44:56] to pay for the bull but i got a gun and
[1:44:58] i'll put him down before he gets here
[1:45:02] but there's no god look for a tree there
[1:45:04] was no tree
[1:45:06] huh what we call
[1:45:10] overwhelming oh
[1:45:13] oh man death staring in the face
[1:45:16] i'm going to die but he was close to god
[1:45:19] i mean his brother bran was close to god
[1:45:21] and god come down and brother brahms
[1:45:23] begin to speak to the pool
[1:45:25] to the bull not the pool and begin to
[1:45:29] apologize
[1:45:31] i am the intruder i have intruded upon
[1:45:35] your
[1:45:36] property and god has given you a nature
[1:45:38] to defend
[1:45:39] your property you don't come on here
[1:45:41] without my permission
[1:45:43] huh he began to apologize to the bull
[1:45:47] and he come but i'm a servant of god
[1:45:49] now go back and go and lay down
[1:45:52] and so forth isn't that right bull came
[1:45:54] right up at him and so forth
[1:45:56] but it was love that conquered
[1:45:59] that bull it is love that will conquer
[1:46:03] any fear in your life that's why i
[1:46:06] believe that's what we need more
[1:46:07] than anything is the love of god in our
[1:46:11] hearts
[1:46:12] more than all gifts operating this out
[1:46:14] of the other
[1:46:15] people doing miracles we want all that
[1:46:17] but brother man says i would rather have
[1:46:18] people that have the love of god
[1:46:20] in their hearts all the rest will take
[1:46:22] place this is the most needful thing
[1:46:24] that we have is the love of god
[1:46:26] because it'll take fear out of your life
[1:46:29] not in your heart
[1:46:30] i believe if you even come down to the
[1:46:31] door of death you even
[1:46:33] don't have to fear it
[1:46:37] because we already know what's over
[1:46:39] there don't we he was showing
[1:46:41] what was over there so you don't have to
[1:46:44] fear
[1:46:45] and let me tell you something how many
[1:46:46] knows that fear tries to grip us
[1:46:50] getting scared of things tries to grip
[1:46:51] us and many times we try to get great
[1:46:54] control of things
[1:46:56] because of that fear that's in us rather
[1:46:58] than just let the love of god flow
[1:47:01] amen praise the lord
[1:47:05] so that's what we need we need the love
[1:47:08] of god
[1:47:09] more than anything else love
[1:47:12] conquers everything and if you are
[1:47:16] perfectly in love with god it throws
[1:47:18] that
[1:47:19] scare and that fear out of your life
[1:47:23] god bless you let's stand
[1:47:29] musicians if you'll come
[1:47:34] the state of perfection the absence
[1:47:39] of fear the presence
[1:47:42] of perfect love is the state
[1:47:47] that i believe the bride will be in
[1:47:49] before leaving this world
[1:47:52] brother branham where shall we go to
[1:47:55] make sure that we're interruptions
[1:47:56] should we go to tucson
[1:47:58] jeffersonville he said no
[1:48:01] it's not a place like that a location
[1:48:04] like that

[1:48:09] that is just gathering christ
[1:48:10] the king and you'll be ready let's bow
[1:48:14] our heads
