[51:58] with me if you would in your Bibles and
[52:00] we'll start in the book of Isaiah
[52:03] chapter
[52:04] 54 I'm G to I'm G to do some things a
[52:08] little different this morning I don't
[52:11] plan on on holding us long this morning
[52:14] and sometimes time gets away from us and
[52:17] I think we can all be guilty of that but
[52:19] we're going to do our best to kind of
[52:20] maybe just do things a little different
[52:22] maybe a little bit more on the
[52:23] Evangelistic side and and just encourage
[52:25] us and and make sure that uh all hearts
[52:27] are clear and we're getting ready to
[52:29] have a communion today and I just want
[52:31] my heart clear and I want to be led and
[52:33] and by the by the Holy Ghost and I want
[52:35] the hand of God in my life and so we
[52:38] want to speak on that this morning and
[52:40] if we would take a little time and as
[52:42] you're turning to Isaiah and I think you
[52:44] about all made it I want to read you
[52:46] this quote here um and it's in the
[52:48] message why I'm praying for the
[52:51] sick he says but after all passing
[52:54] tracks is not preaching the gospel the
[52:57] gospel came not in in word only said
[53:01] Paul but through the power and the
[53:03] demonstration of the Holy Ghost he said
[53:06] not just teach the word but preach the
[53:08] word make manifest you I looked up that
[53:11] word manifest we hear it many times but
[53:13] I I looked it up and to make manifest
[53:15] means to clear or or obvious make
[53:19] obvious to the eye or Mind by one's Acts
[53:22] or
[53:24] appearance yeah so it's it's our jobs to
[53:27] manifest the the power and the
[53:30] demonstration of the Holy Ghost to
[53:31] manifest it to those who look at us the
[53:34] those who see us the those that we're
[53:35] working around the those that we go to
[53:37] school with it's us to to put on the
[53:40] appearance and and the and act so that
[53:43] it makes obvious what we
[53:45] are it makes obvious who we
[53:49] are and he says and and once it's made
[53:52] manifest he said then it's quickened it
[53:55] means it's increased in life yeah that
[53:57] means we we begin to grow they begin to
[54:00] see Christ we begin to grow the word of
[54:02] God begins to live out through us we
[54:04] become living breathing working acting
[54:07] uh represent representatives of Jesus
[54:11] Christ and he said it's quickened and
[54:13] it's brought to pass what God said about
[54:16] it he says that's the gospel in action
[54:20] that's the gospel in action the New
[54:22] Testament Christianity
[54:26] amen so brothers and sisters I want you
[54:28] to know this morning as we get started I
[54:30] want you to know this morning that the
[54:31] hands of God can do more the hands of
[54:34] God can hold more can conquer more can
[54:36] love more the hands of God can heal more
[54:39] than anyone can ever imagine the hands
[54:42] of God this morning I challenge you to
[54:45] put your lives into the hands of God
[54:48] fully trusting in the hands of God
[54:50] Almighty and the holy
[54:52] spirit amen so that the so that our
[54:55] lives speak more than just we're from
[54:57] evening light Tabernacle Our Lives will
[55:00] speak more than our pastor is brother
[55:03] Thomas baller or my mom and daddy is
[55:05] this or that but our lives speak the
[55:07] life of Jesus
[55:09] [Applause]
[55:11] Christ we're not here to blend
[55:15] in you know that's where the church
[55:17] world and I don't mean to keep you
[55:19] saying it but I'm G to preach just a
[55:20] minute that's why the church world has
[55:23] gotten away from God they Tred to blend
[55:26] in with the world I se a newspaper
[55:29] article several months ago the Methodist
[55:32] Church 54% of the people are leaving the
[55:35] Methodist system why because they
[55:37] allowing homosexuality into the pull
[55:39] pits they're allowing same-sex
[55:44] marriages
[55:46] transgenders what are they doing what is
[55:48] their motive they are blending into what
[55:50] the devil is doing into the world
[55:52] they're not sticking with the word of
[55:54] God but they're just slowly blending
[55:56] into it you can't even tell the
[55:57] difference we should look different than
[55:59] the
[56:00] world our appearance our acts our talk
[56:05] should be different than the
[56:08] world Isaiah
[56:13] 54 and verse
[56:16] 11 oh thou Afflicted tossed with Tempest
[56:21] and not comforted behold I will lay thy
[56:22] stones with Fair colors and lay the
[56:24] foundation with sapphires I will make
[56:27] thy Windows of a Gates and Thy Thy Gates
[56:29] of carun and all thy borders of pleasant
[56:32] stones and all thy children shall be
[56:35] taught of the Lord and great shall be
[56:38] the Peace of thy children and
[56:40] righteousness shall thou be established
[56:43] thou shal be far from oppression amen
[56:47] for thou shalt not fear and from Terror
[56:50] for it shall not come unto thee
[56:53] amen
[56:57] behold they shall surely gather together
[56:59] but not by me whosoever Shall Gather
[57:02] together against thee shall fall for thy
[57:04] sake now I want you to listen to this
[57:06] scripture here behold I have created the
[57:09] Smith that blows the coals in the fire
[57:13] and that bringeth forth an instrument
[57:15] for his work and I have created the
[57:19] waster to
[57:22] destroy no weapon that is formed against
[57:25] thee shall prosper amen and every tongue
[57:29] that shall rise against thee in judgment

[58:20] comings in our life cuz Lord we don't
[58:22] want to come up short we don't want to
[58:24] be marred in the hands of the Potter we
[58:26] we want our lives to be clean and clear
[58:29] and we want our our token to be on
[58:31] display and and to be true
[58:32] representation of what Jesus Christ is

[58:37] blessings upon this word and in the
[58:38] people Lord in Jesus name we pray amen
[58:42] you can have your seats I want to speak
[58:44] for a few minutes this morning and I
[58:45] want to talk to you about living in the
[58:47] hands of God and if I were to uh put a
[58:50] title on my message this morning I would
[58:52] title it action figures action figures
[58:56] and and we look at this scripture that
[58:58] we just read brothers and sisters and
[59:00] and we look at it and it says behold I
[59:02] created the Smith and he's talking about
[59:05] here he's talking about the blacksmith
[59:07] and he says I created the Smith and what
[59:09] he's telling us here is that everything
[59:12] that can affect your welfare no matter
[59:15] what Satan brought you no matter how
[59:18] hard it gets no matter how the enemy
[59:20] comes up on you everything he throws at
[59:23] you in your life is under my
[59:26] control it's under my control see the
[59:29] blacksmith who manufactures the
[59:32] instruments of war he manufactures the
[59:35] instruments of torture yeah is under
[59:38] God's
[59:40] control we allow Satan to become so big
[59:44] and we think about this and we think
[59:45] about the weapons of Satan and he's
[59:47] typing it here into the natural with the
[59:49] instruments of war now think about the
[59:51] ancient instruments of war you have
[59:53] Spears you have javelins you have the
[59:55] bow and the arrow and the
[59:58] sling you have hand-to hand combat
[1:00:00] weapons swords and clubs and battle axes
[1:00:03] and knives you have weapons from a
[1:00:06] distance the catapults that Siege the
[1:00:09] towers you have battering rams how many
[1:00:11] ever feels like Satan batters at you
[1:00:13] Satan will take a catapult and throw a
[1:00:15] big flaming ball of fire right at your
[1:00:18] home and that's what's that's what God
[1:00:20] is saying so he's telling us that all of
[1:00:23] the weapons that Satan uses against you
[1:00:25] doubt fear discouragement
[1:00:27] disappointments how many's ever had
[1:00:29] disappointments sure we all do but he's
[1:00:32] telling us that all of these things are
[1:00:34] under God's
[1:00:37] control Satan may come out us like a
[1:00:40] fierce
[1:00:41] Warrior it's his motive to kill steal
[1:00:44] and destroy so he is he is trained in
[1:00:47] Warfare but this blacksmith all of his
[1:00:50] strength all of his life all of his
[1:00:52] skills God says it's in my hand
[1:00:55] [Applause]
[1:01:01] and he says that all of his strength all
[1:01:03] his skills he can do nothing with
[1:01:06] them unless he ows
[1:01:13] it oh my you mean the the enemy that def
[1:01:17] fights us the enemy of the church the
[1:01:19] waster the Destroyer the one that goes
[1:01:22] out and goes out and he's he's trying to
[1:01:24] take control of the nation after nation
[1:01:27] and he's bringing war against Nation
[1:01:28] after nation and and he's Waring at you
[1:01:31] and he's trying to tear your home and
[1:01:32] your life and your children he's trying
[1:01:34] to tear all that apart the waser
[1:01:37] you you mean God created him and he's in
[1:01:40] God's
[1:01:44] control
[1:01:46] important that we live our lives that
[1:01:49] our lives are lived in the hand of God
[1:01:51] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:53] and the token is applied into our homes
[1:01:56] you see this battle taking
[1:01:58] place two
[1:02:03] hands two hands and they're both
[1:02:12] Gods the prophet said Satan
[1:02:16] knows just what you're a little afraid
[1:02:19] of yeah did you ever think about
[1:02:22] that Satan knows just what you're a
[1:02:26] little afraid of and he says there's no
[1:02:28] need of me trying to get around it he
[1:02:30] says I'm just a little afraid of those
[1:02:32] things because they get at me many
[1:02:35] times you mean the
[1:02:37] prophet the messenger of the hour says
[1:02:40] that there's things that Satan knows the
[1:02:41] little things that he's afraid of in his
[1:02:43] life and he begins to attack at
[1:02:45] him he knows exactly what your fears are
[1:02:49] your anxieties your disappointments and
[1:02:51] he begins to sit there and he begins to
[1:02:53] Chisel at you and chisel at at you
[1:02:58] right and he said I'm a little afraid of
[1:03:00] those things he said so that's the
[1:03:02] reason Satan knows he can Bluff at
[1:03:09] you
[1:03:11] y
[1:03:13] Bluff it's not anything go God has this
[1:03:15] all in control brothers and sisters
[1:03:17] don't forget that don't forget when
[1:03:19] Satan is is knocking at your door and
[1:03:21] he's knocking at your door and he's
[1:03:22] trying to deliver things to you that you
[1:03:24] don't want in your life God is in
[1:03:26] control and he's
[1:03:31] bluffing he says so that's the reason he
[1:03:34] he's a bluff he says but now watch he
[1:03:35] says but now if this congregation will
[1:03:37] set real
[1:03:39] reverent remember he's praying if this
[1:03:42] congregation will set real reverent when
[1:03:45] anything is going on be real reverent
[1:03:48] and see that God's got the situation
[1:03:52] under control he said said you'll just
[1:03:55] watch what happens and you will see that
[1:03:58] everything will be all right that's
[1:04:02] right what an assurance it is to know as
[1:04:05] Christians our lives are under the
[1:04:08] control of God Almighty and Satan's life
[1:04:11] is under the control of God Almighty the
[1:04:13] waster can't come to
[1:04:15] waste he can come and
[1:04:18] knock but he can't stick
[1:04:23] around
[1:04:26] how many times brothers and sisters have
[1:04:27] we heard throughout the message you'll
[1:04:28] hear the prophet say now in the name of
[1:04:31] Jesus Christ the son of God I take every
[1:04:33] spirit in here under my
[1:04:36] control over and over and over and over
[1:04:39] we hear him say that what's he doing
[1:04:41] he's taking action physically and he's
[1:04:44] speaking
[1:04:46] Jesus he is a physical body sitting up
[1:04:49] there under the anointing of the Holy
[1:04:51] Ghost and he's sitting there and he Fe
[1:04:54] feels and knows and and is aware of all
[1:04:56] of these spirits around him
[1:04:58] cancers so why do we allow Satan to
[1:05:03] control Our Lives why do we allow Satan
[1:05:07] to come in and tell us that we're going
[1:05:09] to do this or you need to do this or you
[1:05:11] need to you need to don't go to church
[1:05:14] tonight don't go to church tonight you
[1:05:16] won't get nothing out of it you're tired
[1:05:17] you're you've been working all day
[1:05:19] you've been you've been at it all day
[1:05:20] long there's no need you going to
[1:05:22] church take it under
[1:05:25] control take the spirit under
[1:05:30] control he says listen now I take every
[1:05:33] spirit in here under my control for the
[1:05:35] glory of God and may the Lord Jesus
[1:05:38] Christ who is my full
[1:05:43] God my full
[1:05:45] God he didn't say I'm going to do a
[1:05:48] little bit of this my way I'm going to
[1:05:50] pray for this one over here the way God
[1:05:52] wants me to but over here I'm going to
[1:05:53] do what I want want to do because I
[1:05:55] don't like this person I I I know they
[1:05:56] got a bad Spirit I'm going to do it my
[1:05:58] way he didn't say that do you see lot of
[1:06:01] times when we get the conal side in and
[1:06:03] let the carnal side overshadow the
[1:06:06] spiritual
[1:06:08] side I'm GNA let him take be my full
[1:06:11] guide that my life is now surrendered to
[1:06:15] him as an empty
[1:06:18] channel that he speaks through brothers
[1:06:21] and sisters we need to find ourselves
[1:06:22] emptying ourselves out in Allowing God
[1:06:25] to come more into our lives we get so
[1:06:28] clogged up and so muddled with the
[1:06:30] things of this world one of his biggest
[1:06:33] enemies is

[1:08:00] the the over involvement overtakes
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:05] God he said but I want not I want my
[1:08:09] life is now surrendered to him as an
[1:08:11] empty channel that he may have control
[1:08:15] in my
[1:08:17] life he has control in my life that his
[1:08:21] Spirit May control everything that's in
[1:08:26] here wouldn't you like to know that
[1:08:28] every day that you walked that his
[1:08:31] Spirit controlled every single thing
[1:08:35] every
[1:08:36] environment every time you want to lose
[1:08:39] your temper every time somebody cuts you
[1:08:41] off on the road every time somebody done
[1:08:44] a dirty business
[1:08:45] deal then right there you're so emptied
[1:08:48] out and God is so much poured into you
[1:08:50] that he's in control of everything and
[1:08:52] he's in control of every and cast out
[1:08:54] every single evil
[1:08:57] spirit he said that's right he said and
[1:08:59] if I'm so cleaned out that the spirit
[1:09:01] control everything he can heal every
[1:09:03] sick person that's in the building
[1:09:05] tonight he said believe me as God's
[1:09:08] servant for I speak in the name of the
[1:09:10] Lord Jesus
[1:09:15] Christ let me tell you brothers and
[1:09:17] sisters this wasn't the the prophet's
[1:09:22] life he's no different than you or I
[1:09:24] that's right in
[1:09:26] hisself he could do nothing right they
[1:09:29] said brother brand can you will you heal
[1:09:31] me I can't do it he said it's already
[1:09:34] been done by Jesus Christ brother Brown
[1:09:37] what do I do I need to go here do I need
[1:09:39] to do he couldn't do any of those things
[1:09:41] he couldn't pull any of that out outside
[1:09:43] of the gift of the Holy Spirit working
[1:09:45] on the gift in his life without the Holy
[1:09:47] Spirit and the channel to operate
[1:09:50] through he's no different than us but he
[1:09:53] knew knew he had to let that physical
[1:09:55] body come under subjection so that the
[1:09:58] mind of God could come in and take
[1:10:00] complete control of the
[1:10:03] situations turn with me to Jeremiah
[1:10:13] 18 these water bottles have round
[1:10:16] bottoms it's dangerous up
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:22] here Jeremiah chapter
[1:10:24] 18 familiar scripture we we've read it
[1:10:27] several times in the past and preachers
[1:10:29] have preached on it for
[1:10:36] decades you're curious aren't
[1:10:39] you look at sister Alicia she's smiling
[1:10:41] she's
[1:10:42] curious curious what's in it ain't
[1:10:44] rattlesnakes we're not going that route
[1:10:46] this is something
[1:10:50] different Jeremiah chapter 18 verse one
[1:10:54] the word of the Lord which came to
[1:10:55] Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and
[1:10:57] go down to The Potter's House and there
[1:11:00] I will cause thee to hear my words then
[1:11:03] I went down to The Potter's House and
[1:11:05] behold he wrought a work on the wheel
[1:11:08] and the vessel that he made of clay was
[1:11:10] mored in the hand of the Potter so he
[1:11:13] made it again another vessel as seemed
[1:11:16] good to the Potter to make it then the
[1:11:18] word of the Lord came to me saying oh
[1:11:20] House of Israel cannot I do with you as
[1:11:24] this Potter sayeth the Lord behold as
[1:11:27] the clay is in The Potter's hand so are
[1:11:30] ye in my
[1:11:33] hand oh House of
[1:11:36] Israel brothers and sisters we are
[1:11:39] privileged people today to know that our
[1:11:42] lives are in the hands of a Potter that
[1:11:45] no matter what we go through no matter
[1:11:47] how M it may be he don't throw away the
[1:11:51] clay you can make mistakes and and God
[1:11:54] just simply goes in and he pushes the
[1:11:56] mold back down and starts to spin again
[1:11:59] and again and again till he gets you
[1:12:01] where he wants you because why he loves
[1:12:04] you that
[1:12:07] much so here here here he is Jeremiah's
[1:12:11] down here and he's he's down here and
[1:12:12] he's watching this Potter at work and
[1:12:15] Jeremiah notices this lump of clay NOW
[1:12:17] Watch What Happens here this lump P Clay
[1:12:20] is
[1:12:21] uncooperative are you with me
[1:12:24] this lump of clay is uncooperative the
[1:12:26] clay is not doing what the Potter wants
[1:12:28] it to do this clay has not fully
[1:12:32] surrendered itself it hasn't become
[1:12:35] pliable and flexible into the hand of
[1:12:38] the Potter you see the elements think
[1:12:41] with me now the elements of that
[1:12:44] clay can we say the elements of this
[1:12:48] clay the elements of this clay some
[1:12:51] sometimes have not been broken
[1:12:54] down to where it's pliable into the
[1:12:57] hands of the
[1:12:58] Potter and this this lump of clay is
[1:13:01] doing its own
[1:13:02] thing uhhuh this lump of clay it's it's
[1:13:06] going where it wants to
[1:13:09] go it don't go to church when it don't
[1:13:12] want to go it's watching things it
[1:13:15] shouldn't be watching it's listening to
[1:13:17] things that shouldn't be listened to why
[1:13:19] because it's a lump of clay doing its
[1:13:21] own thing the elements God has not been
[1:13:23] broken down yet by the word of God
[1:13:26] that's
[1:13:28] right and so what happens is as the poar
[1:13:32] is turn it the clay becomes
[1:13:35] unstable oh you you've seen those
[1:13:38] Christians
[1:13:41] oneir oneir you think of one third one
[1:13:44] third of what they're at church one
[1:13:45] third of the
[1:13:51] time the kids are at church one third of
[1:13:53] the time because they're at home
[1:13:54] onethird of the time they don't have a
[1:13:57] ride to get to church cuz Mama's at home
[1:13:59] daddy's at home Guardians at
[1:14:03] home
[1:14:06] well i'
[1:14:08] been I tell you what I've been preaching
[1:14:10] this for about the last 10 sermons
[1:14:11] somebody's G to get
[1:14:13] it I'm tired of preaching
[1:14:16] [Applause]
[1:14:17] it but how we act in the hands of God
[1:14:20] tells us tells our children what is okay
[1:14:22] to do
[1:14:27] well
[1:14:28] well but yet we say we want to be led by
[1:14:31] God we want to walk like God we want to
[1:14:32] talk like God we want to speak we want
[1:14:34] we want our lives to look like
[1:14:37] God but yet we failed to surrender
[1:14:39] completely the elements of this clay to
[1:14:43] God
[1:14:45] right you know brother B he was talking
[1:14:48] about the
[1:14:50] one-third Wes deny a little bit he
[1:14:52] didn't call it that but that's what I'm
[1:14:53] calling
[1:14:54] it you I tell you like I told some other
[1:14:58] brother I was just being honest with
[1:14:59] there's no there's no gray area with me
[1:15:01] it's black or white if you don't like
[1:15:02] what I'm saying I'm sorry I'm gonna tell
[1:15:03] it to you
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:07] anyway but I can I can say and I don't
[1:15:10] say it I guess if you want to say
[1:15:12] proudly I can say proud I don't know I
[1:15:14] don't know what the word right word is
[1:15:16] when we talk about our kids parents
[1:15:18] young people when you get married your
[1:15:19] kids are so
[1:15:21] important yeah
[1:15:25] getting your kids in a in a stable
[1:15:27] committed relationship in your church
[1:15:30] family is of utmost
[1:15:34] importance you know I made it my goal
[1:15:36] one year years ago when I first started
[1:15:40] really serving the lord I made it my
[1:15:41] goal I was not going to miss a a church
[1:15:44] service for an entire year no matter
[1:15:46] what my wife can attest to
[1:15:49] this you know we start those New Year's
[1:15:52] resolutions
[1:15:54] and so that was my New Year's resolution
[1:15:55] I'm not going to miss a single church
[1:15:57] service this year because I'm serving
[1:15:58] God with my whole heart about that time
[1:16:01] I was Big Time Florida State simos
[1:16:04] football
[1:16:07] fan
[1:16:10] oh
[1:16:14] oh you know they had that big bowl game
[1:16:16] about January the 7th about that year it
[1:16:19] was early then back in those
[1:16:22] days
[1:16:24] joke you so Hannah said he he would
[1:16:26] never be
[1:16:27] there he he won't be at church at bowl
[1:16:30] games
[1:16:31] tonight I missed that bowl game I don't
[1:16:34] even know who won it didn't matter
[1:16:37] because I had made a commitment that I
[1:16:38] was going to be in the house of God my
[1:16:41] kids know that on Wednesday Sunday and
[1:16:44] if we had Church Thursday Friday
[1:16:46] Saturday we would be right here in the
[1:16:48] house of God I've never once had my
[1:16:51] children ask me are we going to to
[1:16:53] church
[1:16:54] tonight never once have they ever asked
[1:16:58] me here a while back about two months
[1:17:01] three months ago I was I was sick and I
[1:17:03] thought I had to co so I was going to
[1:17:04] stay home and and it was about time to
[1:17:07] come to church on a Wednesday night and
[1:17:09] Carson looks at me he says are you going
[1:17:10] to church man I felt
[1:17:15] rebuked I never had to ask
[1:17:18] him he's asking me right there you go
[1:17:22] this last week my wife was under the
[1:17:24] weather back was hurting her
[1:17:25] tremendously he said Wednesday night she
[1:17:28] said I don't think I don't know if I'm
[1:17:29] going to church tonight I said well why
[1:17:30] not she said cuz I don't feel good I
[1:17:34] said she looked at me like I was crazy I
[1:17:36] said I think it's a valid
[1:17:38] question why are you not going to
[1:17:41] church she was here for those who was
[1:17:44] here she was
[1:17:46] here but there should not be that that
[1:17:49] that that that the elements of this body
[1:17:51] come in sub subjection and subm to the
[1:17:53] hands of the Potter and we wonder why
[1:17:56] things are not peachy in our life we
[1:17:59] wonder why and and then we begin to ask
[1:18:01] God
[1:18:03] wise yeah why am I not
[1:18:10] happy why can't I overcome
[1:18:15] things why are my kids going
[1:18:19] astray why why is my job miserable has
[1:18:22] anybody ever wor in a miserable
[1:18:24] job I thought I was the only
[1:18:27] one why is my marriage
[1:18:31] Rocky but the let me tell you what the
[1:18:33] better question is is the better
[1:18:35] question we should ask is how did I get
[1:18:37] to this place yeah we ought to ask
[1:18:40] ourselves that how did I end up here was
[1:18:43] I faithful to God was I faithful to God
[1:18:47] and so that so that he could bless me in
[1:18:49] these things or was I just over here
[1:18:50] letting him push me back down on the
[1:18:52] wheel push me back down on the wheel
[1:18:54] push me back down on the
[1:18:57] wheel and we want to ask these questions
[1:19:00] but then Isaiah tells us woe to those
[1:19:02] who quarrel with the
[1:19:04] maker
[1:19:07] ah you want to go throwing questions at
[1:19:09] God why why why you better be careful
[1:19:12] woe to those who argue with God why
[1:19:16] would we argue with God when we're the
[1:19:18] ones and it's not that it's not that we
[1:19:20] shouldn't ever cushion or say something
[1:19:22] to God like you know God why why but
[1:19:24] it's the attitude we come at god with it
[1:19:27] why are you doing this God I serve you
[1:19:30] with all my heart once a
[1:19:36] month you said we don't tell the rest of
[1:19:38] the story we're not like Paul Harvey and
[1:19:41] tell the rest of the story we we cut it
[1:19:42] off God i' I've I've been in church my
[1:19:45] entire life because your mom and daddy
[1:19:47] took
[1:19:51] you well
[1:19:55] can the clay speak to the
[1:19:59] Potter no the clay can never tell the
[1:20:03] Potter what he wants to
[1:20:05] be you said well I want to be this in
[1:20:07] the economy of God that's not your
[1:20:10] choice I want to be this I want to do
[1:20:12] that I want to I want to travel the
[1:20:14] world that's not your
[1:20:16] choice the clay can't tell the Potter
[1:20:18] what he wants to be it's the Potter's
[1:20:21] mind that puts to the clay what the
[1:20:24] vessel should end up
[1:20:27] being there's people that believe that
[1:20:29] they actually believe they have the
[1:20:30] right to tell God what they're going to
[1:20:32] do and it's God's job to listen to
[1:20:36] them God you need to follow my
[1:20:38] instructions I'm going to do this this
[1:20:41] and
[1:20:48] this we can't try to tell the Potter
[1:20:50] what to
[1:20:51] doen the Potter the power is in the
[1:20:55] manifestation of The Potter's
[1:20:57] hands how many's ever watched a Potter
[1:21:00] spin anything out spin a vessel out
[1:21:02] maybe you've seen it on Tik
[1:21:06] Tok that's one of them
[1:21:09] traps I got caught watching this guy
[1:21:12] spin a pot one day this a week or so ago
[1:21:14] probably said where some of this came
[1:21:16] from before I knew I done watched him
[1:21:18] make 30 of them identical to the first
[1:21:21] one
[1:21:23] had a whole table out there I thought
[1:21:25] man I'm GNA be a pro at
[1:21:31] this but they make this pottery and it's
[1:21:34] called throwing
[1:21:37] pottery and I I looked this up in one of
[1:21:39] this one of these uh uh
[1:21:44] Potters they said it it's also called
[1:21:47] handbuilding and I thought my goodness
[1:21:50] if God ain't handbuilding a throwing is
[1:21:52] some
[1:21:53] say because the Potter actually throws
[1:21:56] the clay onto the wheel to make it stick
[1:21:59] and she said I call it throwing because
[1:22:01] when I work on a piece all day long I
[1:22:03] feel like throwing it out the
[1:22:07] window but you throw the
[1:22:10] clay down onto the
[1:22:13] wheel and the Potter has into his mind
[1:22:16] what kind of vessel he's going to
[1:22:18] build he thinks this out long and hard
[1:22:21] and he knows exactly what wants it to
[1:22:23] look like he knows exactly what size
[1:22:25] it's going to be he knows exactly what
[1:22:27] the shape is going to be and what it's
[1:22:28] going to be used for in his house are
[1:22:31] you with
[1:22:31] me and this Potter grabs this lump of
[1:22:34] clay and he begins to add a little water
[1:22:36] to it to give it a little
[1:22:38] life Lord and he begins to add that
[1:22:41] water and his goal is to make that lump
[1:22:44] of clay come alive in his
[1:22:48] hands and he begins to spin on this
[1:22:51] wheel and and it starts off spinning and
[1:22:53] he he begins to coddle this clump of
[1:22:56] clay have you ever seen
[1:23:02] it and it starts to spin and he takes
[1:23:05] his hands and man he just forms and he's
[1:23:08] working and he's got this little ball
[1:23:09] starting to form and he's doing all this
[1:23:12] and I think man he's building faith yeah
[1:23:16] he's starting on a foundation he's
[1:23:18] building he's building the base that
[1:23:20] this vessel was going to stand upon
[1:23:23] and he's building up some faith and he's
[1:23:24] building up some virtue and he's
[1:23:26] building up some
[1:23:27] knowledge and he gets to that point and
[1:23:30] then all of a sudden there's a technique
[1:23:31] called
[1:23:33] pinching I said
[1:23:35] pinching how many likes to be
[1:23:39] pinched but the part of takes his
[1:23:41] hands he sticks them down inside the
[1:23:44] clay and begins to pinch and he begins
[1:23:47] to work up the sides of the clay and
[1:23:49] he's
[1:23:51] pinching and he he's trying to get you
[1:23:53] up there with
[1:23:54] patience anybody ever pinched on you oh
[1:23:57] man they'll try your patience and he's
[1:24:00] pinching and he's pinching and he's
[1:24:01] pulling up the vessel and he's trying to
[1:24:03] get it up to the top and it's narrowing
[1:24:05] and it's narrowing and it's
[1:24:08] narrowing and you get up there right
[1:24:10] about
[1:24:11] godliness and that thing starts to
[1:24:14] go it's on that wheel and it begins to
[1:24:18] wobble and that vessel is just a shaking
[1:24:20] back and forth and back and forth and
[1:24:21] back and forth why because that that
[1:24:23] vessel don't have enough godliness in
[1:24:26] it yeah and the Potter he Tri and he
[1:24:29] pinches some more he puts a little more
[1:24:31] pressure on it and he tries to mold it
[1:24:33] and it just begins to just wobble wobble
[1:24:35] and he just pushes it back
[1:24:38] down let's start back let's let's try
[1:24:41] Faith
[1:24:46] again that's exactly how it goes sister
[1:24:49] Becky if you got any age on you brother
[1:24:52] Woody
[1:24:52] you know what I'm talking
[1:24:55] about this vessel this vessel gets to go
[1:24:57] push right back down into the wheel and
[1:25:00] a Potter begins to spin on it
[1:25:03] again and the prophet said herein now is
[1:25:06] set forth in that very thing the love of
[1:25:11] God yes you think that's the love of
[1:25:15] God that's the love of God that he
[1:25:18] brings me up so high then pushes me back
[1:25:20] down onto the wheel
[1:25:23] I don't need those who already preached
[1:25:27] them that's the
[1:25:29] love of God he said he wants he's
[1:25:33] Desiring the love of a family of his own
[1:25:35] the sons and Sons of a family Sons like
[1:25:38] himself and he lies there all of mankind
[1:25:41] as one lump of
[1:25:43] clay and he says he takes that one lump
[1:25:46] and he begins to make vessels of honor
[1:25:49] and
[1:25:50] dishonor yeah you remember the
[1:25:54] wasters yeah you remember the wasters
[1:25:58] you remember the Smith the
[1:25:59] blacksmith so he's got vessels of honor
[1:26:02] and vessels of Dishonor and he says it's
[1:26:04] his choosing to be which one it is he
[1:26:06] said it's his choosing the ones born of
[1:26:08] the spirit will be trained to conform
[1:26:11] Into His
[1:26:12] Image they'll be trained that will spins
[1:26:15] and in our lives the hands of the poter
[1:26:17] begins to train up that vessel yes we're
[1:26:21] looking for complated vessels brothers
[1:26:23] and
[1:26:24] sisters and he said he's working on him
[1:26:26] he's breaking him down in order that he
[1:26:28] can rebuild it exactly as he
[1:26:32] desires not as you
[1:26:35] desire not as I
[1:26:38] desire sometimes life makes me
[1:26:41] angry because it don't go the way I
[1:26:44] think it should
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:47] go then I have to look back and I say
[1:26:50] God my life is in your
[1:26:55] hands it does mean no good to worry it
[1:26:58] does mean no good to fret it doesn't
[1:27:00] mean no good to get angry to get
[1:27:04] discouraged you think that's that's

[1:33:52] Hogan he got a hold of Andre and he
[1:33:55] picked him up about this far I had to
[1:33:57] set him back
[1:33:58] down and they interviewed him later he
[1:34:00] said I didn't know if I was going to be
[1:34:01] able to do it or not you know it's all
[1:34:03] staged I don't break the news to you
[1:34:06] it's all
[1:34:09] staged my dad told that to my friend
[1:34:11] when we were playing he started
[1:34:14] crying he got some mad he couldn't he
[1:34:16] got some mad don't you tell me I know
[1:34:18] it's real it's
[1:34:20] real
[1:34:23] it's all staged but then later on he got
[1:34:26] a hold to this 550 lb 7 foot 6 joh and
[1:34:30] he picked him up over his head and
[1:34:31] slammed him down and the world went wild
[1:34:34] let me tell you I made this little man
[1:34:37] right here slam Andre the Giant 15,000
[1:34:40] times after
[1:34:45] that we relive that scene over and over
[1:34:49] and
[1:34:50] over why because it was an iconic time
[1:34:53] in history when when web wrestling was
[1:34:56] taking over the
[1:34:58] nation but let me tell you something
[1:35:00] about this guy right
[1:35:02] here you see this guy he can't do
[1:35:06] nothing if he ain't in my
[1:35:11] hand
[1:35:14] jump
[1:35:18] speak jump off a top rope power drive
[1:35:23] have you seen him move yet if he does
[1:35:24] we're we're going we're going to have a
[1:35:29] conversation
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:33] no that's why it's so important that we
[1:35:35] are fully in control of the Master's
[1:35:39] hands when we place our lives into the
[1:35:42] hand of
[1:35:43] God then we begin to
[1:35:45] move then we begin to praise then we
[1:35:49] begin to
[1:35:50] clap then we begin to shout then we
[1:35:53] begin to overcome then we begin to see
[1:35:55] things start happen in our lives why
[1:35:58] because the Bible says in the book of
[1:35:59] Acts that great Miracles were happened
[1:36:02] at the hands of Paul not God Paul what
[1:36:06] was it it was God working through Paul
[1:36:09] these Miracles begin to take place and
[1:36:11] what was it it was Paul acting as the
[1:36:14] hand of all Mighty
[1:36:16] [Applause]
[1:36:19] God 45 verses
[1:36:22] in the New Testament speak about the
[1:36:25] hands the Old Testament describes the
[1:36:28] hands of God as descriptive in his hands
[1:36:31] are the Deep places of the earth it says
[1:36:34] we are the Sheep of his hand his hand is
[1:36:37] outstretched to the
[1:36:39] Nations on on the cross Jesus said into
[1:36:42] my father's
[1:36:45] hands I commend my spirit the hand of
[1:36:49] God is Authority the right hand of God
[1:36:52] is a good
[1:36:55] standing Paul was given the right hand
[1:36:57] of Fellowship as a a token a measure of
[1:36:59] appreciation into the
[1:37:02] church laying on of hands has been used
[1:37:04] to bless preachers laying on the hands
[1:37:08] pray for the
[1:37:09] sick laying on the hands hands hands
[1:37:12] hands with these hands we give praise to
[1:37:14] God with these hands we pray to God with
[1:37:18] these hands the working hand we clap our
[1:37:21] hands and
[1:37:22] appreciation we show our love to our
[1:37:25] spouse by putting a
[1:37:26] ring on their
[1:37:29] hand when a child is sick we take our
[1:37:32] hands and we pull them up to
[1:37:35] us it's all about the hand of
[1:37:39] God hands hands hands vessels of clay I
[1:37:43] think about Peter there and Peter as
[1:37:44] he's looking out there and he's on that
[1:37:45] boat and he looks out there and he sees
[1:37:47] Jesus at a distance and he said B me to
[1:37:50] come so he jumps out he says come so he
[1:37:53] jumps out he gets just a little bit of
[1:37:54] ways out there and what does he say he
[1:37:56] starts to seek and he says save me
[1:37:59] Lord and it says Jesus outstretched his
[1:38:03] hand to lift him
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:07] up let me tell you it's never too deep
[1:38:11] it's never too far away it's never too
[1:38:14] dim it's never too Grim it's never too
[1:38:16] Bleak when God's hand reaches down into
[1:38:19] your life
[1:38:22] there's a little
[1:38:23] jarus was sitting back there and brother
[1:38:26] brandham said that jarus was a he said
[1:38:29] he was a secret
[1:38:30] believer he said he was a secret
[1:38:32] believer in so much that that he
[1:38:34] believed in Jesus he watched The
[1:38:35] Miracles he seen the Miracles but
[1:38:37] anytime Jesus was talked about he would
[1:38:39] get real quiet and kind of clam up he
[1:38:40] never would admit to it and and the
[1:38:43] prophet said but one day his little girl
[1:38:45] got
[1:38:46] sick he said his little girl got sick
[1:38:50] and here was Jerry
[1:38:51] out there he was fixing to go through a
[1:38:53] molding process let me tell
[1:38:56] you God began to work and mold on him
[1:38:58] and he says Jerry's called the doctor
[1:39:01] and the doctor said we'll give her some
[1:39:02] antibiotics for a few days and she'll be
[1:39:05] fine but he said Time After Time After
[1:39:08] Time she kept getting worse and worse
[1:39:09] and worse and he said the doctor would
[1:39:12] come look at her again and she's just
[1:39:13] getting worse and worse until finally
[1:39:15] the doctor had to look at jarus and say
[1:39:17] let me tell you I hate to say this but
[1:39:20] your little girl is at the point of
[1:39:26] death let me tell you that right there
[1:39:28] will make a man get into
[1:39:31] action he didn't care who knew he was a
[1:39:33] Believer that's right at that point he
[1:39:35] went to his wife the prophet said he
[1:39:37] went to his wife and he began to tell
[1:39:38] her he said you know what I got to do I
[1:39:40] got to go see that man that Nazarene I
[1:39:42] gotta go see that man of Nazareth Jesus
[1:39:45] the one who's healing people and she
[1:39:47] said I know that's exactly what you got
[1:39:49] to do
[1:39:56] go quick go get him said he put on his
[1:39:58] little coat his little turban over his
[1:40:00] head he started down there and he heard
[1:40:01] some church members said where you going
[1:40:04] jarus ain't that the way it
[1:40:06] is yeah where are you
[1:40:10] going he said you know
[1:40:15] what I'm gonna go get

[1:40:20] Jess
[1:40:21] are you one of them Holy Rollers that's
[1:40:23] going to go down there and see that guy
[1:40:24] the Deacon the Deacon called him out he
[1:40:26] said wait a minute now
[1:40:28] jarus you can't do
[1:40:30] that what would the new pastor think
[1:40:32] about you huh but brother brandham said
[1:40:36] brother the time had come for action and
[1:40:40] he said jarus had to have some action
[1:40:42] the time he says may strike you for
[1:40:45] action and you may have to stand all
[1:40:47] alone in the spotlight of everybody and
[1:40:50] Watch God's hand work in your
[1:40:53] life and he said he stood there and he
[1:40:55] said it's time for the church to take
[1:40:58] action all around take action and he
[1:41:01] said here's little jaras he worked his
[1:41:02] way down through the crowd and he gets
[1:41:05] to Jesus and he finally got to him and
[1:41:07] he says I need you to come my daughter
[1:41:09] is sick they've given her up no
[1:41:13] hope now watch what happens along the
[1:41:16] way the prophet tells that as Jesus and
[1:41:19] jarus went walking
[1:41:23] he's working along to go with him and
[1:41:25] all of a sudden he says who touched me
[1:41:28] come on Lord we got to go my daughter's
[1:41:30] my my daughter's life depends on you but
[1:41:33] Jesus said there was a hand that touched
[1:41:35] him who was it to touch my
[1:41:38] garment the woman with a blood
[1:41:41] issue you see sometimes things come in
[1:41:44] time sometimes God has other things to
[1:41:49] do he's not an instant he's not an
[1:41:52] instant
[1:41:54] coffee and he said finally all that goes
[1:41:57] on and the woman's healed and Jesus is
[1:41:59] gathering himself and they're walking
[1:42:00] again and he said there's two Blind Men
[1:42:02] that's been blind since
[1:42:04] birth and now after years and years and
[1:42:07] years of being blind we're going to take
[1:42:08] the time to heal
[1:42:10] them my daughter did you hear me my
[1:42:13] daughter Lord she's laying there sick
[1:42:15] she's laying there dead she she's about
[1:42:17] to die you're going to have to get there
[1:42:19] and he said he took his face fingers and
[1:42:22] placed his hands on the blind eyes and
[1:42:25] healed those blind eyes you see there's
[1:42:27] healing in them
[1:42:29] hands there's healing in your
[1:42:32] hands some of you believe
[1:42:36] it and he said he he he got him down
[1:42:39] there and he walks right down there to
[1:42:41] the house and he's getting ready to go
[1:42:42] in and he said all of a sudden he hears
[1:42:43] this screaming and crying going
[1:42:46] on all the screaming and crying is going
[1:42:49] on and they're saying she's dead dead

[1:43:09] starts going and all that carrying on
[1:43:11] like that he said hey give me peace can

[1:43:14] imagine you know how we get all tore up
[1:43:18] we get all tore up at at death and and
[1:43:21] and and because why because it
[1:43:22] emotionally it affects us because we're
[1:43:24] the ones still here we're the ones
[1:43:25] hurting they're living
[1:43:28] on but we're the ones that's grieving

[1:43:32] happy for them but yet that that love
[1:43:34] and that it's gone it rips a pain in our
[1:43:36] heart and the crying and screaming Jesus
[1:43:38] said give me
[1:43:40] peace she's not dead she's only
[1:43:43] [Music]

[1:46:03] be and it's our responsibility to take
[1:46:05] what
[1:46:06] God has done in our lives and what God
[1:46:09] wants to do in our
[1:46:10] lives and take it with pleasure not to
[1:46:13] ask and not to question not to debate
[1:46:16] not to argue but just just as the clay

[2:09:34] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[2:09:37] that he should depart out of this world
[2:09:39] and unto the father having loved his own
[2:09:42] which were in the world he loved them
[2:09:44] unto the end and supper being ended the
[2:09:46] devil having now put into heart the
[2:09:48] heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to
[2:09:51] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[2:09:53] had given all things into his hands that
[2:09:55] he was come from God and went to God he
[2:09:58] rises from supper and laid aside his
[2:10:00] garments and took a towel and GED
[2:10:02] himself after that he porth water into a
[2:10:05] basin and began to wash the disciples
[2:10:07] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[2:10:09] wherewith he was girded then cometh he
[2:10:12] to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him
[2:10:14] Lord does TH wash my feet Jesus saith
[2:10:17] unto him say answerest and said unto him
[2:10:20] what I do thou knowest not now but Thou

[2:10:29] Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith
[2:10:32] unto him Lord not my feet only but also
[2:10:34] my hands and my head and Jesus saith
[2:10:36] unto him he that is washed needeth not
[2:10:38] save to wash his feet but is clean every
[2:10:40] wit and ye are clean but not all for he
[2:10:43] knew who should betray him therefore

[2:10:47] had he had had washed their feet and was
[2:10:49] taken his garments and was sit down
[2:10:51] again he said unto them know ye that I
