tonight amen and also brother steve had asked me outside of church and i went for my heart checkup monday and i got a real good results and except for i've been telling the story i accused the dryer of causing my pants to shrink and my doctor said that 10 pounds you put on hadn't helped matters any so he said i needed to slack off a little bit and i said well i don't feel like i've been doing a lot of extra but i got thinking about it and i guess i do a lot of extra a lot of times brother brad and i don't realize it but so just thankful for that and just appreciate the lord helping us and he's now he's going to have to help me get rid of it because i told him i said it's a lot easier to get it on than it is to get it off and he said well you need to do that because it hurts your blood pressure i said okay doc and he's about this big around and i said okay so i'll take you at your word if you're gonna go to the doctor you need to listen to him so you just pray for me and i just want to tell you i appreciate your prayers very much and i always i always get nervous when i go to the doctor because i always think the worst and my blood pressure played crazy on me and it was high and i told him i said doc i have white coat syndrome he just laughed at me but anyways one of these days when we say the lord we won't have any of these issues but until then we'll keep on pressing on oh i want to see him tonight page 8 sister becky amen don't you love him with all of your heart well as i journey through the life of singing as i go and pointing soul to calvary to the crimson floor and

the time he puts a song god is good all the time through the darkest side is [Music] amen praise the lord amen enjoyed the different songs kind of tonight amen man i thought it was real good i enjoyed doing songs and so amen we want to introduce brother ted and i was back there thinking of amen brother ted and you know the amen and the things that he's done for the lord you know we could probably stand here and amen and we really couldn't justly mention or even say a lot of the things that he's done but i know he's been very instrumental in going all over the world amen in his lifetime probably preaching twice as many times as i've ever thought of preaching so and so we only have brother ted once a year so how many will save her tonight amen amen i'm going to enjoy it how about you so it's a real privilege to have brother ted with us we appreciate his friendship and amen appreciate the work that he's doing out there in arizona you give him a little church out there and wonderful beautiful group of people out there and so we just really great greatly appreciate our brother amen amen and for all that he's done he's certainly a veteran amen in the message one of those has carried this gospel for many many years spent most probably all of his life just really laboring in the gospel so i think he needs a lot of credit don't you amen and so we just want to say that we love him and appreciate him and want him to welcome to the pulpit tonight amen and take his time and just have to take his liberty amen we sure love him let's sing amazing grace is my brother becelly comes amazing grace how sweet the [Music] [Music] sounds [Music] i see [Music] amen and when the battle is over we shall wear a crown yes wish i'll wear a crown and we shall wear a crown and when the battle is over wish i'll wear a crown if new jerusalem [Applause] [Music] crown well praise the lord amen i want to thank you for standing and honoring the presence of the lord thank you brother thomas always for opening up your door to us and our door is open [Music] oh okay thank you amen i never look at the people on the front and second row look beyond them good to see you sister god bless you well greetings uh uh old friends and uh new ones and brothers and sisters in christ it's good to be a christian in about in the book of zechariah we want to read a scripture um we uh i do have a few wednesday night length sermons in my entourage and i found one here so trust it'd be a blessing to you i i had three different things really on my heart but it just wasn't going to be any way that i could preach that to you tonight so being just a wee bit tired as well traveling over here but just just to see you all i'd make the journey anytime just to come over here and see you and to see you serving the lord that's a wonderful thing and he he that began a good work in us isn't going to quit so you know there's no quitters in the kingdom of god we might think we're going to quit but we can't something just keeps pulling us something keeps lifting us up again we thank god for that amen zechariah 14 7 one verse and but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light that that this sermon is just for your church here brother thomas amen we we back home in arizona with it we call ourselves the evening time lighthouse our little assembly so we're part of this light of almighty god isaiah 60 verse 1 arise and shine isaiah 60 verse 1 arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee amen thy light that means there's a light for you it belongs to you god said it was yours and nobody else can have it nobody else needs it like you do it's it's designed and designated just for you that's a portion of his life amen thank god and the second verse for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and the gross darkness the people is that the truth about where we're living today or is it and it's getting darker all the time but the lord shall arise upon thee i'm gonna believe there's a rising up of the light within our life as it darken the darker it gets the more the light is on display amen and the more influence the light has in our life and we thank god for that so let's pray let's pray heavenly father i thank you for the privilege of being here and even like uh fellowship tabernacle here in elkton kentucky we thank you for your mercy i thank you for these precious saints and friends loved ones both old and new we thank you lord god that though we are times going by and our bodies are wearying but lord there's a power that's inside of us said won't let us go and thank you lord that you didn't start a work in us just to walk away when times got tough but you're going to be here you are in it for the long haul for us lord and you are able lord to complete the work to finish what you've begun within us we thank you for that lord and we as far as salvation we know we're already a finished work from before the foundation of the world lord that when you chose us and put our names in the lamb's book of life but now we're the light is shining upon us and we're coming to life lord and father we just pray for a little revisitation of that light in our life or we need a little touch uh one more time just to quicken us lord we getting weary in the journey as we're seeing so much darkness lord that's uh turning us into uh just causing us to feel depressed and sad but lord lift our spirits once again father we ask you for thy glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you take your seats happy to reach you from sister myrna she couldn't accompany me but she's here with me right now i can hear her voice almost all the time i hear everywhere i go i hear and uh honey i didn't know you were and it wasn't but yet she's my conscience and uh i did miss her too so i know you would have loved to see her but uh there's coming a day when she'll fly over here without an airplane so and so thank god for that and uh the miles don't get shorter you know if they would just take texas out of the middle of the u.s it wouldn't be so far between us and you right i think we were an hour and a half flying over texas it was beautiful it was beautiful and good things do come from texas by the way thank god god's so good to us but not all the good things come from texas amen some come out of nazareth amen oh you thank the lord you know god is so great in this hour and message is just increasing all over the earth you know even this coved you know this was satan's ploy you know with his corona you know satan trying to make a crown you know corona means crown and and uh and that's what this virus was described as and so it had all these points on it like this but see it's all a lie from satan it's all a lie from satan because he's never he got no crown at all he's trying to steal your crown you're the one that gets the crown because jesus won it for you amen how many believe that so it's all it's all satan's agenda to try to uh manipulate our minds and if you're like me you're still human anybody isn't uh can't help you tonight but if you are we we get we get dragged down real easy by looking around seeing all the darkness and the stuff that's going on we we it's almost like we're i don't know brother uh brian there and different ones in the military uh they get this ptsd i never was in the military but feeling like i'm getting ptsd almost every other day now with all the stress that we're under and don't even realize it but it takes a toll it traumatizes you and it draws some virtue out of you amen so that's why we gather together amen that's why he said if two or three three of you will get together uh then i'll come in there and i'll give you some for this message which is our is the light of the hour and brother man said we the believers our message he said is the light of the day we are the light of the day amen so it's god in human flesh it's not god in heaven anymore it's not god or although that prophet still speaks to us every day all right he speaks to me identity this is our name being called this is the opening up of the book this is god telling us who we are amen and we're not defeated amen we're not losers we're not we're not we're not gonna uh we're not there's no end for us we're gonna just keep on going keep on going this is the only end is for this outer hit thing here and this is my enemy this how many got one of these outer things here um this is our problem this is our enemy but our victory is that light that has come down inside of this body amen not only would you identify that and say that believe that when god brought you into this message light came into your life amen you were walking in darkness how many knows we were born in sin shaping the nick when you all come to the world speaking lies and that was darkness upon us not even our thinking was blind we couldn't see we couldn't understand we couldn't comprehend we just thought well just you know money and trucks and houses and stuff and we still like those things but there's more to it than that now it's something that has drawn us and attached us to a place where there is no darkness amen blessed be the name of the lord we thank god for that so we're talking about a darkness that's covered coming and a squeeze i i was going to talk about the three exoduses the three surrenders and the three squeezes but i'm not going to talk about that tonight because i couldn't fit that i couldn't squeeze that in i don't know what to say amen but the squeeze we talk about the thing going on in the government and stuff and all of that and it looks like it's just i tell the people all the time there's covidon this stuff's going on this election it's not the squeeze but it's getting us ready for the swedes i mean it's a preliminary what's going on and just to push us down or to try to close us down amen and you know brother ben said they they won't close us up god will take us up and so we're if we're going to talk about those things we have to talk about the message and the message is god amen it's like the bible is god if how many have a bible hold your bible i didn't bring mine but i've got my tablet and i got the word of god on my tablet so i'll hold it up this is actually god you're holding in your hand amen but now when you read that when you hear it preaching when something in you says wow that touched my my heart light came into you right then amen you didn't see it i didn't see it we don't have to go around you know taking pictures of pillars of fireballs of fire to know that we have the pillar of fire inside of us today amen now somebody else might never see it but god sees it god knows it's there and you know it's there and you believe it's there amen and that's what that's what exposes the devil whenever he comes to try to rob you how many knows the devil's a preacher how many knows he's a some people say he's a good preacher uh i say he mean he may be qualified as well as a good speaker but he can't be called a good preacher because he's not preaching the truth only a good preacher isn't maybe so qualified as a speaker but he's a good preacher is a is preaching the truth when he does speak amen just like brother man said the early apostles they said they weren't eloquent preachers they were very simple said they were men a few words but boy get them in the pulpit he said just after five ten minutes the presence of god come in the room so what it is is what god is doing is a supernatural light has come in our life today um brother brown said here an uncertain sound he said when we were made and when we were made they found out that your body is full of light they found that out x-ray proves that anybody ever had an x-ray do they see anything yes well how could they see anything because the x-ray doesn't have a light of its own it's taking picture of the light that's inside of you so they prove that proves that um that you have light inside your body right and so this isn't the message on certain sound 1960 the x-ray does not have any light of its own i'm just reading what the prophet said and he says uh it's your light that it uses so i just said that but now i'm reading it directly like he said it all you go back the tapes see anything you hear quotes and stuff and over my i guess i've reached the status of being a veteran according to brother byler so god bless you but over these years and travels 87 overseas trips and just going around and by the help of the lord and this whole year has been totally i don't know what i haven't met this is my first time i've gotten on an airplane in a year and and it's just uh really really been hard for me and uh sister myrna now even our son and different ones are saying we're getting used to you just hanging around but you know this this this something that's inside of me doesn't like to just sit around because there's more souls to reach out there there's people hungry there's people calling so as soon as the doors open i'ma fly and go uh we we was recently called the dedicated church over in togo and the brother visited another church that where we preached here about four years ago and that brother we walked in there and as we walked in there oh there were four of us preachers and we walked in there and the people in the village you didn't know it but they were demon worshippers and they were which they had a witch uh a warlock kind of a leader of a man and a wit will woman as well leading them and they were scaring everybody with their lies yo brother uh we might not have uh uh uh uh that kind of the darkness black magic and stuff like that here but we've got politics we got false preaching false preaching we got churchianity we got all this stuff trying to put spells on people we thought we got people telling us that we're deceived that we're crazy brother bram said if i'm crazy leave me alone because first of all that tells me if you're gonna leave him alone that means you can't help him you ain't gonna change him right he leave me alone but he said and another thing is i'm happier this way and i'll do what that was when i had my right mind amen so blessed be the name of the lord if this being crazy paul said in a way that's crazy that's the way i'm going to serve god you know i was going to preach a little sermon called crazy in love that would have been a good one for tonight but i just i just thought it through and i thought you know i don't know i don't know and i seem kind of strange but brother uh if you if you were sitting on the back seat of this in this middle row say of the evening like tabernacle here in elkton kentucky uh uh tonight uh we could maybe that would apply to you that terminology you're crazy in love amen that was you say well i was one time but say what's the matter with the other people been married for 20 years it just gets better and better amen i mean you're still crazy you're still crazy because no matter what they do and how they do how my wife loves me so much no matter how i've disappointed her she's still crazy she lost it she has totally lost it that's what i was going to preach on how simple it is but then you apply that to loving each other maybe i'm going to change my sermon but you know loving each other you got to be crazy to love some of you guys you got gotta be crazy for you to love me it's gotta be like it's totally in ins it makes no sense because we don't make sense one day we're this way one day we're that way one day we're like this one day we're there do that we are so we are so confusing of people do you know what god's people are impossible for anybody to love except god and god's people so don't expect everybody to love you because they for one thing you're crazy to them amen but thank god i'm crazy and loved and i'm crazy i'm crazy for the gospel i'm crazy to tell another soul somewhere amen leave me alone you can't change me amen and i'm happier now uh it's kind of nice to have to have lost your mind and have gained the mind of christ and you know let's see oh so a lot of people don't know they want they want their sound mind you on their sound mind thinks oh yeah oh yeah got to do what they say you got to do what they say you got to do what they say they'll do what they say do you know that this nation was born on civil disobedience i'll tell you what they don't know brother ben said they're going to close our churches down you know that that squeeze comes down it's going to come down on us he said they're going to close our churches down churches like this one you know i always tell the people i said look if when that freeze comes down and your church don't get close you ain't a church like his church i want to be one of these churches amen one of these message churches not only that i want to be one of the message people i want to be one of those message pastors preachers amen i want to be a message husband how about you man you want to be a message husband then you've got to reject all the darkness reject all the lie reject all the hype reject all the fear reject all of satan's lie amen and cling to the truth and love god with all your heart soul mind and strength be crazy in love see i'd be none if that was my sermon for tonight it would be finished but we're going to talk about what makes us crazy is light has come to us now watch when we were born brother brown said you you were born your body is full of light now i said you're born with four rays of light in you so even if you live to be 90 94 or 96 or only 30 your light starts going out after he explains it here so some of you you got i'm gonna you know set you in different uh groups here tonight some of you are four light people and because brother brown said when you're born you're born with four rays of light how many believe that uh you mamas know when your baby's born they gotta hold off they gotta the lights don't look very good they're but they're powerful strong powerful strong amen just keep some keep some fighting on amen we thank the lord powerful and you're young when you're young when you're five six years old we never we never were scared about uh sneezing on each other when i was five six years old nobody ever got sick when i was five or six years old we did get sick but it would just last a day or so because lights was inside of the power was inside of us amen couldn't stand it a germ get on a real believer a real young a powerful person full of light and that old germ will get sick and tired of being around there like brother adam when he was devil was telling me he was going to die for eating the bees and onions and a cornbread and he said devil let me have a little talk with your buddy said not buddy but you know devil i guess you have what do you call the devil devil that means tormentor he's no good he'll never be any good why because he rejected the light amen he rejected the light but thank god you accepted the light he said temple i got something to tell you do you like to hear me william branham worship god and the devil said no he said then you better get out of here because that's what i'm fixing to do right now because i've been healed i've been prayed for and i'm not going to die like you think i'm all right amen oh brother that man had light in him didn't he how many believe that thank god for that so we appreciate that so after he said you're born with four rays and after a little while say okay four how many are under 25 don't be ashamed of it i know you'd like to be elder or veteran you know like me but you know don't be ashamed to be a young come on that's great i'll trade you you've got you're a foray person and then after a little while about 20 25 one ray goes out so how many is 26 in and be seen between 26 and 35 god bless you i'm putting all this down in the book somebody sent me here [Laughter] and you've got to be careful somebody you're going to start infiltrating our church and taking down names and informations about us and you know they'd have to because some of us are so such secret believers i don't know anything about it i'd like our testimony to be shining out there where there's no secret who i am amen there's no secret what i believe i want my light to be very bright amen how many love god so then he said then okay so you're in the goal we saw a couple of hands of the three light category then after about 35 uh or 40 another one goes out now how's your minds tonight your arithmetic four minus three so you got one light after he says 45 and uh then wait till you get about 65 you really know you only got one light left were you you didn't between 45 and 65 you thought you were at your best but not it is not sold because physically you only had four minus three that just leaves one but there's something about that last light there was just god grace and mercy that as he put those lights in the human being they weren't weaker but stronger as they went to that fourth one because you've watched people who are after 65 70 they'll make you wish you could do what things can do what the stamina that they have like they'll they'll say it and i think it's kentucky's saying as well they just don't make them like they used to and you know it's just it's that way you see people rugged tough by laverne wallace for the russell's daddy sister serenity's uh grandpa there god bless you all of you i'm not gonna start calling your names i won't be done before 10 o'clock if i do that because it take me five minutes or ten to remember some of your names but i'll never forget a face we're going to be together forever amen but thank god but you know when on that statement i don't remember like i used to but when i need to i have a memory god quickens us amen how many believe that when you need to do something you can do it because god put light in you that has a capability that you don't have right amen so we find then um that on that last slide i was talking about brother wallace 95 or 4. and just fell and broke a hip the other day and well three years ago he broke the other one and you know we keep we keep thinking well he'll that'll be it now he'll just go downhill yeah he got some light you got a powerful light he i think that they took him and did surgery put a rod in there tied the ball and the female bone together had to be tied together with a rod it probably hurts anybody had hip surgery shoulder surgery i would imagine it hurts but somebody told me they saw you the other day and said brother oh poor brother he said poor nothing he said he said i'm all right he's back on his feet going around i said you know it's just a type of something else now it can't be just natural because naturally you'd want to just give up you want to retire you want to get out you want to escape you want to just fold up sit down do nothing wait for your time to come you know live your life out like that but a believer the longer they go in this message the longer they walk in the light the more they surrender to the light that's inside of them the more god has a hold of them and the more they understand that their purpose their purpose is to give light in this dark haze that we live in amen and we are in a dark age and brother man said they're depending on you those heathen out there depending on you and me somebody around here these even around here depending on you and me my brother is that true he said brother said i would witness more but i'm ashamed of my life okay if you didn't if you said that then we need to get something different going on we need to have more power of life but the bible didn't talk about a defeated light did the bible say that the evening light was a defeated light that was a wimpy light there was a weak light that it was unqualified light the bible said it was it was a your light and there was a powerful light and it would it would the glory of god would be seen in your life through that light if i had spiritual eyes i could see a light over every one of you that has that light of god now this is where i'm going because our time is running fast you have four lights and then when that last light goes out you're finished your life goes out of you now some people lose that light through accident or other thing in an untimely way they lose those lights and that light's what's keeping you alive did you ever watch people who some people that just go through life just existing and other people are just living life they're they're not worried about everything they're taking things as they come they they're flexible they're not beat down by everything always complaining they're positive they they're they're high on life you're not going to believe that when i was a hippie in the world and people were getting high and everything and stuff and i met this guy one time and i said i said hi are you high and he says yes i said what are you high on life it cut me to the heart i never thought about that how could you be high on being alive you had to have something to stimulate some stimulant to help you through this traumatic world back in my days it was a vietnam conflict the world was in a mess atomic bomb everybody is worried about the earth blowing to bits and the insanity and the evolution teaching and all this stuff coming on which is a predecessor to what we got now this thing's been coming a long time brother this didn't just drop in on us this has been coming a long time and what it is is satan trying to put down your light my brother but he can't because the darkness cannot overcome the light is that true amen high on life i'm high on god brother i'm i'm i'm on my motivation and my strength and i can say this honestly today it isn't coffee now because i only had one cup of coffees at four o'clock this morning and i ain't running on that one anymore so all these preachers say you know it's not the coffee that's making me excited well if they just had one it might be part of it right there i guarantee it but right now ain't no caffeine left in my system you didn't slip anything in on me did you brother caleb somewhere i just had a little bottle of water and an apple and i'm starting to feel my light getting brighter again i i don't know my feelings anybody here go by feelings i'll just go by reality but brother if something if if you're depressed and all of a sudden you wait no more something something happened amen listen to the name of the lord while i was praying somebody touched me how did how do you know that brother said because i was so down i was so troubled and then all of a sudden i was lifted up again you tell me nothing happened something happened have you ever had something like that happen to you i'd like it to happen tonight i'd like to happen to every day i'd like us to realize what this light is now we're going to go in and finish this the help of the lord amen so every time he said he said those lights are just and he talked about x-rays and i don't know if you've met people who are anti-x-ray people in the message and there's people who are anti this are into that you think brother branham said they may take it to an extreme anti-doctors or you know they're not taking everything brother branham said be that they're not taking what he said but they're trying to make some kind of a rule or regulation out of the message this message is not rules and regulations this message is light and light is power and light is ability amen how many love the lord because when the darkness you're in the dark anybody ever been in the dark where you couldn't see nothing so dark you know so you can't see your hand in front of your face so dark so dark like that just one little match can light up the whole room it's the power of the light we can light up the room one little promise when you're it's so dark in your mind so dark in your heart so dark in your in your own strength is gone one little one little promise whoa now i can go now i can live now i can serve now i can do now i know what i have to do hey man what about a blind person not blind but a person who's walking in the dark and they can't see anything and they can't see they just they don't know what that is they don't know what that is but put a little light on confidence comes again being confident of this very thing the bible said where's our confidence going i'm not confident in the president i'm not confident in the government i'm not confident in politics i'm not confident in the economy i'm confident in god i preached the people had no economy but they ain't better than the princes they ate better than the royal family because god provided for them supernaturally i've been in pepto's homes where they had a nicer house than the mayor of the city because the mayor was an idol worshiper in the past was just simple on their knees praying all the time and god just made i don't know how it happened do you ever hear the song pennies from heaven there's an old old son that ages you boy if you if you remember that song you have just aged yourself put yourself way back way back you're a veteran amen but god can reign it out of heaven i told somebody the other day said brother ted aren't you worried about paying your bills i said no even if i lose my if i can't preach anymore nobody'll give me any offerings or anything else don't worry about the god can make the hundred dollar bills rain out of the sky for me god could lay me on one of your hearts and you could you could take care of me the rest of my life god can i don't expect you will but uh listen just saying that god can do anything don't limit god god listen why worry you're worrying pulls the light out of your body worrying saps your strength can you say amen that's why i'm so glad i got here and uh we spent we spent an hour together with caleb and i brother thomas on the phone brother richard and steven and all this time and well once i got stephen turned away from his depression over uh this whatever this is is this an election no i don't know what it is but whatever it is our brother said i'm in shock i said well okay let's talk about something that will help you so we start talking about god he said that's right that's right that's right that's right pretty soon hey there's no there's no depression anymore why light came on the scene now you can see where you can walk what you can do now amen is it all right if i preach a little bit i mean a little and so we're getting to this glorious part of this because this is sad part because i'm on my last light but i'm telling you what this was this one about what system emerges honey i don't understand you you should just rest you've gone too many times overseas you've gone across the seas and all my life i get to write books about those trips just like many of those even the traveling part of it so hard so a brother traveling overseas in the military that is no glory to all of that stuff the glory is knowing you're doing something that's helping somebody have a better life amen so i was telling you about togo so we walk in there and we walk down to this uh village not bandundu that's in the congo um well i'll think of it when i need it i don't need it for you because you wouldn't know it's not even on the map this little town in togo we walk in there and all the people who was into this witchcraft they're looking at us and they find out we're having a meeting we start singing in heaven's i mean they all just kind of filter over one by one but one by one the whole town turned out and all the elders there were witches and leaders who had kept the people in bondage and the younger people were the people that had been held in bondage by the witchcraft and they sat and i they called me up to preach and i stood there i didn't preach any fancy sermon i'll guarantee you because i've never been known to do that but i just preached the gospel and the next thing you know before i even stopped they all are at the altar 100 people i don't know what in the world it was something that the light had done it was not something that no man had done it is what the light had done and so i prayed over them i prayed to them and listen they were like in unison that they all represented one group of darkness and until the last one got prayed for they were all going to stay up there they weren't in exist to go back to their seat they were waiting for everyone to get prayed for and after i prayed last one they gently went back to their seats and then i went away uh we went away had another meeting or two and then i went away and i come to find out the brother said brother can your church help us to build a church because we got 100 new converts they said all the witch leaders all those all those sorcerers uh have repented give their hearts to the lord and i've baptized them and said that they're i'm gonna make deacons and preachers out of those guys i said praise god i said he said the kids they said yeah and you don't have to tell them that they're immoral or dressing wicked you don't to tell them that they look like the devil himself they just know it something came on them and then he said here's the testimony brother he said when you brothers walked into the village that day and everybody was looking they weren't looking at your you just because there was a white skin color there amongst those people they were looking at a light that was over top you people i said oh god i didn't even feel it listen you don't feel it sometime but it's there you don't know it's there but god put it there for a reason to help you to make us realize that we're not worthy of it because we're not always living the best kind of life to where well lord i'm worthy of more light you know more credit i wasn't worthy of what brother byler said there i guarantee you that but i'm humbled by that but i'm not only humbled i'm challenged because if somebody said i've done things for god i want to wonder when i want to start doing it now that's the way i'm thinking about it where am i gonna ever let this light have its way in my life that's what i want how many love the lord now i guess back that gets back to being crazy in love i'm so crazy in love for lord jesus christ that you you can't stop me until god says it's time this is like with all of us nobody can take you out of here until god says it's your time to go brother david those testimonies i love those testimonies nobody can take you out of here till god says it's time for you to go amen until that light moves out amen blessed be the name of the lord so here we're coming down to our point four lights in the natural birth right he's talking about the natural birth you were born with four lights and uh then because you're a time creature time takes the toll on that light and you wear out i think it was brother david and brother thomas and i were there together and talking about oh you still look young and he said same thing about me i think did you you had an opportunity i said no you probably thought i looked 100 tonight being tired not sleeping last night and stuff but that's uh that's no problem the light can make you look young again amen we were all telling each other how good each other looked and i said we are all lying to each other but we believed it you know we said boy really and that that's what stimulated me to preach this sermon i'm going to tell you that that's what stimulated me to preach this sermon i said perfect because and then when brother told the testimony about the licks of fire from brother jason and the pillar of fire that's on the believers and then thinking hey where am i preaching tonight in the evening i said that's my notes i've got those notes for this church right here amen amen so what it is what it is we're coming down to the the final part of this what it is is this you're made up of these four lights but there are limited lights they have a limit like a a a life like a battery has so much limited life or a light bulb has so much limited life amen i don't care what kind of light bulb if you if you're in a light bulb business they know light bulb that's going to last forever it's got a life expectancy and it might go beyond that but it's going to sometimes go dark again amen but so what's prophet going on talking about it and he says in the in uh uncertain sound 1960 but always get ready for a change when that word butt comes in there like paul said we were lost and then we were sinners and we were undone and under the power of the darkness and everything in the book of ephesians paul apostle paul said but god who is rich in mercy amen see what's that like the devil's telling us you're gonna you're going down your church you're dying you're getting old you're losing your power losing your strength losing your joy losing your testimony losing your zeal losing your fire but they haven't heard the rest of the story but god rich in mercy what's this and this is where my subject goes i think there is another light brother random said and that's god and he said god is a different light than these cosmic lights which is human literal temporal physical we can weary that eventually go out god is a different light and one time we listen now is brother been talking to us right here he's right here you don't have to resurrect him call him back he's done his ministry put it right here you know that boy so the first time i heard brother brown's voice i was a drug addict i was a sinner just a crazy crazy i was crazy crazy then and darkness but you couldn't have told me that i had the answers for it i was so smart when i was 18 19 years old i knew everything some of you were too weren't you now you got a few years on you i wonder what what happened to me i used to know so much and i was looking over some of my old notes that i did some sermons that i preached years ago and i said man did i preach that that's way deeper than what i preach now but yet i'm deeper and yet simpler than i was before what's happened life isn't interested in embellishing things it isn't interested in just just words light is interested in power illumination lighting up exposing the enemy giving you power over the darkness amen blessed be the name of the lord thanks be to god for his love and mercy i didn't finish the story about togo and as a result of that church there which we've built and dedicated another brother was visiting said i heard about that light that was down in that village down there that time and i came in here and turned these witches into deacons and preachers and these young people who were under the spell look watch young people satan wants to get you under the spell of music of sin of ungodliness immorality filth and stuff and things like this sin wants to write in sin is the darkness sin will take you dark it'll put the light out of you it'll take your joy away anybody ever had joy and then lost it what what happened darkness came in on your joy amen satan came in with some believing get your beliefs like eve in the gardens looking for new light darkness came in on her darkness came in on her don't welcome everything into your life reject the evil resist the darkness amen absolutely right and you have to do that and i guess if if we didn't have this gospel to be fired up about we'd be fired up about civil disobedience we'd be trying to start a little march i'd be over here starting to trying to rouse you up and let's merge let's express ourself we have a right you know but do you think that's gonna work because the light said it's got to go darker and darker and darker over here you know i'm kind of kicking myself because i dug out a quote where brother and i told the church and i keep it comes back to me all the time you read what brother branham said so you can hope you know for uh four more years or a a a a period of time of liberty civil liberties religious liberties and um constitutional um rights that have been guaranteed to us by almighty god but when brother branham said he said it's honeycomb with communism back in the 50s 54. and he said and it wants to take over and he said and it will take over so you know that'll almost make you kind of depressed again you're fatalistic wow it can't get better can't get better it can't but you can you can look at daniel down there in the into babylon you know in the hebrew children for all years 70 years with a heathen nation they wouldn't be able to go to church or even publicly say praise the lord or anything that were ridiculed that were persecuted they were squeezed when the squeeze come down god's got an exodus amen and and god's light came over those men and enlightened the hebrew children in the in the in the bird in the fiery furnace and a light myth unlike met daniel in the lion's den this whole message is about light you can't talk about this message we're not talking about light but and we'll look at the audience says i see a light over you son he said the holy spirit is a light and he said it said pillar fights it's me my opinion it's the same lord jesus christ that brought the children of israel out of egypt is here now with us the message of the hour amen i believe that don't you so god is a different light but he is a light and one day coming back to that quote because i want you to believe this so you don't take these quotes lightly i mean don't play the words don't take them like they don't really mean what they say take them with the weight and the light could mean bright light visible light or light could mean not heavy don't take these quotes lightly in my sense of like it's just some foolish because here's what he said he said one day we were walking in light capital l that's got to be god when it's capitalized there's something in your life that can be capitalized it's god devil you never put a capital d on devil i don't even write lucifer's name down somewhere i never put a capital l on it he wasn't worthy of it amen uh the english teachers you probably correct me on that because it's a it's a proper noun or a name should always be capitalized i can't i can't bring myself to capitalize devil does he deserve that ain't nothing capitalized about it maybe nothing capital about him ain't nothing big about him he's a coward to begin with why he's a devil he's a coward because he rejected the light he walked away from the light that made him a devil lucifer wasn't a devil lucifer was the son of the morning he was a light but he rejected the light that was sharing with him that there was a greater being coming not just an angel but a man in the image of god and satan rejected that but i'm telling you what there's no greater light that god ever had than what he put in his own son lord jesus christ this was that true light amen and then in our day we saw a man that was so much like jesus christ that everywhere he'd go people said i saw that light that was following that man uh where were we is down here in elkton right down here in the old uh armory uh whatever this building is remember we had that meeting down there uh brother john you were just smaller littler younger you had more lights more lights but now we're not talking about the spiritual one you got more of that now [Laughter] but we walked up and down inviting people and get a brother perry green and someone else and there was a brother from b springs kentucky um lin lineal no trying to think of his name but if you remember you tell me if your light's better than mine gates brother gates and brother gates got up he said well he said brother green's over here from arizona and different people telling you and brother ted's got this little church over here this talks about god sending a prophet and that he was fulfillment of the scripture and even time it shall be light and not not just a fulfillment but the beginning of the fulfillment we could say because we are the fulfillment amen and he said but he said ah he said i was a preacher i was a preacher in a nominal kind of pentecostal holiness church and all my people one day came i'm saying oh did you hear william branham's coming to town you're not going to be in church next sunday brother brother gates because brother branham's here coming and he said i'll tell you truth i got real jealous and envious and he said i was really mad i was really mad that why would another preacher come in here and try to steal my people away no you'd have to be a preacher to know what i'm talking about but you know you invest a lot of time in people's life and you think you own them sometimes that goes with families too listen we gotta the light in you will be able to put your children in the hands of god you you don't have to save them you don't have to save them if you could you could have saved yourself too but you can't save yourself so you can't save them but somebody put you in the hands of god and god did the saving now you do the same thing but anyway brother gates he says i came to the meeting just out of spite because he said i just wanted to see what was so great about this man if i got the story wrong but john you straightened me out but you know some of the your mama would probably remember that real well one of these days we'll have all these things like the whole picture on it beautiful and uh then he's he says and he said i was just fit to be tied i was just so angry and you just had this spirit on me like all right let's just see what this man can do and uh he said here came brother bran i'm walking out a little man with his bottle up like this and comes out here and he says good evening friends and he said and then he began crying i could already you could hardly make it out we didn't record back in those days we didn't record this testimony he started crying so bad i couldn't make out what he was saying too good but like the gist of it or the main part of it was i thought it was just going to be a man but said when that man walked out there was someone with him [Applause] and then i understood and he said i broke down and cried like a baby for days and days and days and when i came out of that crying i was a believer too praise god you don't know light by how significant it is or how you could describe it you know light by what it did what what accomplished in your life when god this is you can't put it in words well or feeling you know everybody wants a poetry make a poem about no your life becomes the poem you become the living light you become the light walking in human flesh how many love the lord so this this light this eternal light that's what adam lost and then he died see if he wouldn't have never died adam would have never died there wasn't no death there was no death but adam died because the lights went out but he lost that eternal light amen but god gave it back to him in a promise and it came back in jesus christ and now it's come in this last days the holy spirit the spirit of the living god now brother all of our excuses go out the window the way i can't do it i can't live the life i can't forgive i can't i can't quit hating that brother or sister i can't overcome my temptations yeah i can't be a witness all those excuses goes out the door in the presence of that light when that light comes in there's nothing can hold you down then because it's not you it never was about you this message isn't about you it's about that light that god hold you i'm just a light i'm i'm i'm a i'm a a vehicle uh that has the light in it amen i can't see the light in you i didn't ask you to if god wants you to you will but i know it's there because i've heard lots of people i was preaching one time and a brother was sitting in the congregation and he had a bad bad toothache it was terrible next thing he knows he sees me walk out and there's a light over my head just all preachers all christians listen you say i don't know yes it's there and said next thing i know i saw that light i said oh jesus next thing i knew i had a gold filling in my tooth now if i was part of a a black church or some kind of uh the money lover what's that guy the man who loves money dollar his name is dollar million dollar uh excuse me i shouldn't call names in the pulpit but the love of money is the root of all evil and anybody any preacher loses his ministry when he goes after the gold and satan come to me and he said look you could do that for a ministry you could make that's your your forte that could be your ministry that could be your your best thing you put the gold fillings in people's teeth and and then they'll come around they'll pay you for it you devils see light exposes the devil that's an easy one to pick up on but sometimes the devil hides himself real good in quotes and things amen but when you have a light in you you can pick up on that devil and say hi you devil with a small d amen so that's the end of my sermon our fifth light has come back see the one that adam lost jesus brought it back for us see if the body lights can go out but i got a light that'll bring me up out of the grave you've got one too i got a light that'll bring me up out of the depression it'll bring me about a coven it'll bring me up out of biden it'll bring me up out of anything see i know my audience i know you know if i you couldn't say that in phoenix i wouldn't say that i'm never going to say that ever again destroy the tape look the devil himself small d could be the president of the united states as far as as far as we know the pope of rome could be the president of the united states or camilla could be the president united states and then if so that wouldn't take my life out i wouldn't stop from telling people about christ and living right because it ain't me living it was me but it ain't me now cause this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine i always get the feeling when i come here why is it brother songs because you're just so i love you all so much i feel like i preached this last time when i was here i know i didn't because this was just for you tonight and it's over and that's the best part to leave you with one thing that light didn't want to just remain a light up in the heaven the sky you know just shining up brightly like that christmas star no no that light wanted to become you and live in you and walk in you if you have that light which you do i told you about brother cromie i think i know i told you that story but i didn't preach this sermon i don't think but brother walter cromie was dying of a heart attack and his wife he was airlifted from clarksville not clarksville clarkston washington uh to uh up there to uh um the big city up there in washington uh spokane washington took him up the hospital spokane and she had to drive and they airlifted him because his heart was so bad she got in there and after six eight hour drive she got in the hospital she's running in friend i call the house my husband how's my husband as my husband and i said who are you saying mrs cromer oh mrs chrome come with me they brought him in a room and there was a doctor in there and the doctor says oh you mrs croney yes how's my husband that's my husband he's had this bad heart and said well before i answer that question i gotta ask you call me now calm your nerves a little bit you gotta ask your question i'm at my wit's hand i don't know what it is i'm a doctor but i don't know i've never seen anything like this and he uh showed him an x-ray of brother chromie's heart he said here's the tear here's the heart attack here see that's muscle here yeah and here's the good part and here's the bad part and the stress you can see it all on a picture but he said i would i want to ask you about a little bit no it's that light gotta hold her so it's the holy ghost and guess what you don't have to guess i'll tell you his his heart was within a few days was a hundred percent healed 100 percent he lived for about 20 years one of my best friends is slovak just of my same nationality as me a dear friend and thank god for that so i was telling that story in russia and then a little girl asked her mama said could i ask could you invite brother ted's to house for dinner tomorrow and uh and uh and uh and brother dawn and brother ted and would you invite them to come over and talk to me and uh because i want to ask him a question and she was eight years old a little little precious little sweetheart those four light categories are real precious hey three lights are precious too and only two light and one light are veterans they're really precious when they're all full of that light and that zeal for life and got all these questions and they're real moldable that's why he said except you become like a little child we get all stiff and start so we know everything don't tell me i've been this message 40 years don't tell me i know what the prophet said you know i've met baptists that are sweeter than some messy people you know i think some baptists got more light in them than some of them you know i want light brother i don't want theology amen you're not letting me quit some somebody here is light is keeping me preaching tell your light to stop pulling onto here no you're not doing you're not helping i'm gonna keep on but but thomas said it he said i'm a veteran and i just preach right but i've done many great things he said one of the greatest is i'm gonna close when i said i'm gonna close that's great but i haven't said i'm gonna close yet but i'm going to close i haven't forgotten thank you brother but your light and my light agrees that's exactly what i'm gonna do and uh so we went over for a beautiful meal some of the people at the church the other day asked me brother ted in russia what do they eat like is it petroleum or oil is it is it uh uh uranium uh are they starving i said no i tell you that they're not starving he said if they looked at most of us in this church they'd say you're too skinny your cheeks are gonna be out like this you know and i said i said man no they'll kill your food the food's delicious so she gave us a beautiful meal with a little girl she hadn't slept all night she's just anxious to ask me a question so after the dinner she said now brothers i'd like you to come in the room my little sweetheart i can't remember her name i wish i did i can see her in my mind's eye and uh said i have a little question then the interpreter brother vitale who was the pastor up there in uh not vitali uh it was another russian name and he's he says she wants to ask you this question but she said another tit to ask brother ted asked brother ted when he was telling a story about his friend who had the light in his heart oh so sweet she said do i have that light in my heart brother ted some of you may remember i think i told you that once before that's a touching stone i was so touched by after my eyes were watering for a while i said brother dawn oh he was a crybaby too he was growing oh man this is so sweet this is the presence of the lord just a little house there food was precious one soul it was just one little girl you know but light is thy light has come that was her light she needed to know about her light so well i said sister i said any interpreting for me it says do you love the lord jesus christ die she said that's russian yeah yep ah you've been baptized in the lord lord jesus christ's name you've been obedient you identified yourself with jesus in the baptism you read your bible and pray every day you help your mommy around the house love to go to church and i asked her a few more questions next thing yes yes my little sister you have that same lag in your heart the holy ghost in your life the sometimes you know it right sometimes you don't know i've met people i didn't know whether they had the holy ghost they said they did but i didn't know but that time with that little girl i knew anybody identify with that and thank you yeah we're all children the like we go through similar things we had we agree our lights agree because we're all from that big light same light and so i thought lord and so soon as i told her she didn't even say die anymore she just fell sound asleep in everybody's arms jed slept all night she just was gonna be wanted to know the answer now she was okay uh couldn't we couldn't that happened to us even on a wednesday night service sometime or just didn't prayer me just some prayer meetings just you and god alone sometimes that could happen until that's about our heads heavenly father and it's nice to talk about the light you know what how great the light is and we'll walk in this beautiful light how beautiful the light is it's nice to talk about it and try to paint word pictures which preaching is just painting wordpress pictures of something that can't even be painted really but what's even nicer is when it just is there you know when the light is there right and when it's there you'll know it's been there how will i know brother you'll know i want to see that and that's my whole life's purpose is to carry that light let others see it but not just so they could identify it with me i mean i've showed pictures of brother madam with pillar fire over his head all over the world so the films everything all over the world japan and all different languages showed brother brahms films and people oh i believe i believe it's nice to believe that the light was with him but what's even more significant as as i come to a complete close now is has the light been there in your life is it there maybe there'll be somebody to say brother ted wow i just i'm thinking about this and you know i'm putting a lot of shadows out here lately i'm putting a lot of shadows out that's a mixture of light and dark i mean it proves there's light if you've got shadow it proves there's light but it's not all light sometimes it's more dark so the scripture said there'll be coming a day there'll be kind of mixed lives you know this kind of light and then there's dark too there mixed with it but in the evening time there shall be no darkness it'll be all light so are we there maybe somebody here would just raise your hand and want the old veteran chicken that humbles me man i want to start serving god now i'm tired of not giving my all would there be anybody want to raise your hand and have us pray for you as a close of the service we'll have the musicians come i'm going to pray and then we're going to turn the service over and it's done as they come i see our brother's hand god bless you brother anybody else want to raise your hands your brother i want you to pray for me because i i don't want mixed signals i don't want my life to be shadowy
