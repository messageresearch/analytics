[0:00] destroy and kill you you know and it's
[0:02] truth you know everything that we face
[0:04] this morning as human beings is because
[0:07] they didn't believe every word that
[0:08] proceeded out of of the mouth of God and
[0:11] they didn't listen to what God told them
[0:13] it goes all the way back to the Garden
[0:15] of Eden when Adam and Eve decided not
[0:18] stay behind the word of God and use it
[0:20] as their foundation and protection when
[0:22] they stepped outside of
[0:25] that and use their own interpretation
[0:27] their own ideas what we're facing this
[0:30] morning it goes all the way back to that
[0:32] this morning and then at the end where
[0:34] we're at right now in that last age it's
[0:36] the opposite the only way you're going
[0:38] to make it on the other side is that you
[0:40] put yourself completely behind the word
[0:42] of God there's nothing left out there
[0:45] for your enemy to get in to your life
[0:48] you got to be totally sealed into Jesus
[0:50] Christ this morning but I was thinking
[0:52] this morning I was reading
[0:54] this I was thinking of uh of Ahab you
[0:58] know you all heard the stories of Ahab
[1:02] the bad king in Israel but I was just
[1:04] thinking you know ahab's that guy that
[1:06] just you you all see him in life ahab's
[1:09] that guy in life that he's he just can't
[1:12] get it done he just can't do right you
[1:15] you all run up against Ahab his name
[1:17] isn't going to be Ahab uh but there's
[1:20] always that guy no matter how much God
[1:22] works with him or how much he pushes him
[1:25] and prods him he just can't do right
[1:27] he's just an aab he's just who he is and
[1:31] I was reading at the end here I'm not
[1:34] going to this is a long chapter I'm not
[1:36] going to read this whole chapter but the
[1:37] prophet comes to Ahab and tells Ahab
[1:40] that he's going to give victory over the
[1:43] syrians and uh and in through the
[1:46] through I'm not going to read the whole
[1:47] chapter but there's two battles here
[1:49] one's in The High Ground one's in the
[1:51] low ground and the syrians being pagans
[1:55] well they believe that it's either the
[1:57] god in The High Ground that delivered
[1:59] them or The God in the low ground that
[2:01] delivered them being pagans and God told
[2:03] Ahab through the prophet that he was
[2:05] going to bring about a great Deliverance
[2:08] because of their them being a pagan
[2:10] nation and telling him that God couldn't
[2:12] do this but I'm just going to read at
[2:14] the end and Ahab made a bad choice
[2:18] sometimes we make bad choices he let the
[2:20] king of Syria get away and this is what
[2:23] I'll read what uh starting at about the
[2:26] 33rd
[2:28] verse uh
[2:30] here he says now men now the men
[2:33] diligently oberved whether anything
[2:35] would come from him and did hastily
[2:37] catch it and they said forgive my
[2:39] pronunciations here again and my
[2:42] starving thy BR brother benh Hadad then
[2:45] said go bring him then be came forth and
[2:48] caused him to come up into the Chariot
[2:51] and benad said unto him the cities which
[2:54] my father took this is the king of Syria
[2:56] they're talking about took from thy
[2:58] father I will restore Thou shalt make
[3:00] the streets for thee in Damascus as my
[3:03] father made in Samaria then say Ahab I
[3:06] will send thee away with his Covenant so
[3:08] he made a covenant with him and sent him
[3:10] away and this is what God they have in
[3:12] trouble because the word of the Lord
[3:14] told him to destroy the Syrian host and
[3:16] he just like Saul did he chose to do it
[3:20] his own way and then this these last few
[3:23] verses deal with that and a certain man
[3:26] of the sons of the Prophet said unto and
[3:29] I was just thinking also this morning
[3:32] you know Ahab had seen the fire this is
[3:34] this is after Ahab had seen the fire
[3:36] fall from Heaven and consumed the
[3:39] sacrifice and the and the false
[3:42] prophet of ba were destroyed so he he's
[3:46] seen all that and yet still he's doing
[3:48] this and a certain man of the sons of
[3:50] the Prophet said onto in the word of the
[3:53] Lord smite me so he's telling the
[3:55] prophet is telling someone to Smite him
[3:58] and he didn't I pray thee in the man
[3:59] refused to Smite him then he said on beh
[4:03] because thou has not obeyed the voice of
[4:05] the Lord behold as soon as thou are
[4:07] departed from me a lion shall slay thee
[4:10] and as soon as he was departed from him
[4:12] a lion found him and slew him then he
[4:15] found another man and said smite me I
[4:17] pray thee and the man smote him so in
[4:20] his smiting he wounded him so the
[4:22] prophet departed and waited for the King
[4:25] by by the way and disguised himself with
[4:27] ashes upon his face and as the king
[4:30] passed by he cried onto the king and he
[4:33] said thy servant went out into the midst
[4:35] of the battle and behold a man turned
[4:38] aside and brought a man onto me and said
[4:41] keep this man if any means be he be
[4:45] Miss then shall thy life be for his life
[4:47] or else Thou shalt not pay a Talon of
[4:50] silver and as thy servant was busy here
[4:52] and there he was gone and when the king
[4:54] of Israel said unto him so thy judgment
[4:56] be thyself has decided it and in haste
[5:00] he took ashes away from his face and the
[5:02] king of Israel discerned him that he was
[5:04] of the prophets and this is the prophecy
[5:08] on aab here and he said unto him thus
[5:11] sayith the Lord because thou has let go
[5:13] out of thy hand a man who
[5:15] IO to underly destruction therefore thy
[5:19] life shall go for his life and thy
[5:21] people for his people and the king of
[5:23] Israel went to his house heavy and
[5:25] displeased and came to Samaria and I was
[5:28] just making some notes this morning
[5:31] and you know we don't want to be Ahab in
[5:34] our life we want to the whole word of
[5:37] God be in us let me go if you would jump
[5:41] with me to James the 2
[5:45] chapter and this chapter actually speaks
[5:47] a lot about Ahab or people you know you
[5:50] know sometimes we act like Ahab
[5:52] sometimes sometimes we don't do what God
[5:54] tells us to do and we pay the price but
[5:57] uh I'll just read here from James the
[5:58] first chapter
[6:00] and then I'm going to jump back in my
[6:02] uh my the concordance in the back of my
[6:06] Bible and this is what James had to say
[6:08] in the first
[6:09] chapter James the servant of God and of
[6:12] the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes
[6:14] which were scattered aboard greeting my
[6:17] brethren counted all joy when you fall
[6:19] into I Temptations you when you think of
[6:21] a scripture like that it's it's not fun
[6:24] to be in trials and temptations but
[6:28] James is telling you it's through those
[6:30] that you receive the
[6:32] blessings and my brethren count it all
[6:34] joy when you fall into diverse
[6:36] Temptations KN this that the trying of
[6:38] your faith worketh patience and I was
[6:41] thinking that we I was listening to a
[6:44] message last night and I was listening
[6:45] to my office this morning where it talks
[6:48] about does God ever change his mind and
[6:51] I and I was thinking he was talking
[6:53] about all the people in the
[6:56] Bible that thought that God would change
[6:58] his mind and they did
[7:00] and it's no different for us and then he
[7:03] goes on to knowing this that they trying
[7:05] your faith work is patience let your
[7:07] patience have its perfect work that you
[7:09] may be perfect and entire want nothing
[7:12] and if any of you lack wisdom let them
[7:13] ask of God it giveth to all men
[7:15] liberally and op prth not and it shall
[7:18] be given him so if you need wisdom you
[7:21] know where you have to go to get it you
[7:23] have to go to God through the word of
[7:25] God and let him ask in faith not
[7:27] wavering for he that waver is like the
[7:29] waves of the sea driven With The Wind in
[7:32] toss and basically Jame our brother
[7:34] James is telling us here this morning
[7:36] when you go to pray you have to pray
[7:38] believing that God's going to make it
[7:40] happen it goes on let not the man think
[7:44] that he shall receive anything of the
[7:46] Lord and I was just thinking of this
[7:47] scripture here this deals with Ahab Ahab
[7:50] right here a double-minded man is
[7:52] unstable in all his ways and basically I
[7:55] was reading a dictionary definitions of
[7:57] what it means to be double-minded
[8:00] basically a double
[8:03] mind person is inconsistent in what he
[8:06] believes he believes one thing one day
[8:09] he believes the next thing that that's
[8:10] say we all find ourselves like that
[8:12] sometimes you either believe the
[8:14] scriptures or you don't believe the
[8:15] scriptures if you're teetering back and
[8:17] forth between them and you don't have no
[8:19] foundation and you don't have no rooting
[8:21] that makes you double-minded and I was I
[8:24] had some uh scriptures here if you have
[8:27] a Thompson Chain reference Bible you can
[8:29] go to CH uh page
[8:32] 1533 but here's some examples of what it
[8:35] means to what the Bible says about being
[8:38] double-minded and I was thinking of and
[8:41] if you want to think of what a person
[8:42] looks like when they're double-minded
[8:44] Ahab is a perfect example of what a of a
[8:47] person that is double-minded he can't
[8:49] just seem to believe the right way he's
[8:53] in between two opinions all the time but
[8:56] I'll just read these scriptures because
[8:58] they speak volumes here and then 2 Kings
[9:01] the 2 chapter and the 33rd verse it says
[9:04] they feared the Lord and served their
[9:06] own Gods after the manner of Nations
[9:09] whom They Carried Away from hence so
[9:12] they didn't believe the word they were
[9:14] in between those and then Zephaniah the
[9:17] 1 chapter and the fourth verse it says I
[9:20] will stretch out my hand upon Judah and
[9:22] upon all theh up to je Jerusalem and I
[9:25] will cut off the remmen of bow from this
[9:27] place in the name of for my
[9:30] pronunciation here the Chans with the
[9:33] priest and Zephaniah the 5th verse it
[9:36] says them that worship the host of
[9:38] Heaven upon the house to and men that
[9:40] worship that swear by the Lord swear by
[9:43] the Lord and that swear by Malcolm so
[9:47] they they were covering they were you
[9:49] know like a lot of people do they like
[9:51] to cover their BS well if this works
[9:53] I'll use this if that doesn't work I'll
[9:55] use this so they're in between their
[9:58] whole life and in Luke the 16th chapter
[10:00] and the 13th verse this is what Jesus
[10:03] had to say no servant can serve two
[10:05] masters either he will hate the one or
[10:07] love the other or else he will will hold
[10:10] to one and despise the other you cannot
[10:12] serve God M and that's where we're are
[10:15] this morning you can't can't halt you
[10:17] can't have two different different
[10:19] opinions this morning you're either
[10:21] going to serve one or you're going to
[10:23] serve the other if you find yourself in
[10:24] between all the time there's a problem
[10:27] with your experience and he goes on to
[10:29] say in 1 Corinthians the 10th chapter
[10:31] and the 21st
[10:32] verse and this is the same thing you
[10:35] cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the
[10:36] cup of devils you cannot be partakers of
[10:39] the Lord's table and the table of devils
[10:42] you know when you think of a scripture
[10:44] like that this morning we live in an age
[10:46] this morning where this this is more
[10:49] than possible with all the technology
[10:51] out in the world you know you can be if
[10:54] you don't find if you don't be careful
[10:56] you can find yourself jumping between
[10:58] these two different worlds and he goes
[11:00] on I just read in James the 1 and the
[11:03] eth chapter a double man is unstable and
[11:07] is all his ways and then James the
[11:09] fourth chapter and the eth verse draw
[11:11] nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you
[11:14] cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify
[11:17] your hearts you double minded so James
[11:19] is telling the people that are halting
[11:21] between two opinions that they need to
[11:24] stay that opinion and go the right way
[11:26] but I was just thinking of that
[11:28] scripture this morning
[11:30] where you know your gospel 44 I was just
[11:33] you know like I
[11:36] said everything that we face as
[11:38] Christians or as Believers this morning
[11:40] is based on that scripture there Matthew
[11:42] 4
[11:44] and4 whether you're going to believe
[11:46] God's word and act on God's word and
[11:48] believe every word of God and step out
[11:50] in faith believing it and I was thinking
[11:52] I was listening to that message this
[11:54] morning and last
[11:57] night when
[11:59] in Moses's life in Elijah's life and all
[12:02] the prophets all the kings everyone's
[12:05] life that the minute you step
[12:09] outside of what God has told you to do
[12:12] or where God has told you to walk you're
[12:14] going to have problems when Moses struck
[12:17] the rock the second time it caused a lot
[12:20] of problems in his life he came outside
[12:22] of the word of God when he struck the
[12:24] rock the second time and we're no better
[12:26] than Moses are any anytime we step
[12:29] outside of the Jesus Christ and outside
[12:32] of the word of God there's no protection
[12:34] for us anymore so as this age comes to
[12:37] an end here it just lets us know that
[12:39] you need to be under the word of God
[12:41] even more this morning than you were
[12:43] last night and you'll need to be under
[12:45] it even more this evening as you were
[12:47] this morning the only protection we have
[12:49] as Believers this
[12:51] morning is the reveal word of the hour
[12:54] that's the only thing that you can hold
[12:56] to in this age that we liveing and know
[12:59] that it's right and that it'll bring you
[13:01] to that place that you need to be but
[13:04] it's not just the word itself you have
[13:06] to have that experience you have to have
[13:08] that present in your heart and life
[13:10] Brother
[13:14] David amen you love the Lord this
[13:17] morning amen let's stand this morning if
[13:20] we could and amen pray that was a
[13:23] blessing to your heart this morning and

[49:03] the Lord amen again this morning amen
[49:06] and I feel like I got a new message amen
[49:10] so
[49:11] amen uh just pray the Lord will bless
[49:14] the thoughts and the meditation of our
[49:16] hearts pray for sister Martha in a
[49:18] special way I know that she's had a real

[49:38] not feeling too well so it's still going
[49:39] around so we just pray God will just
[49:42] raise ones that are sick amen right back
[49:44] up again praise the Lord how many glad
[49:46] for God's healing power you know I had a
[49:49] revelation this morning you know how
[49:50] brother BR and how some people stopped
[49:52] and try to teach how that the devil can
[49:54] heal and so forth you know and brother
[49:56] Bram absolutely refuted no no no no no
[50:00] and I never really thought about it that
[50:02] much but I felt like this morning I had
[50:03] a revelation because you know if the
[50:06] devil could actually he can put cancer
[50:08] on you he can put sickness on you is't
[50:10] that right but he can't cure it you know
[50:13] right he's not if he could heal he could
[50:16] raise from the
[50:18] dead he'd have the power to bring you I
[50:21] mean healing that's what it is isn't
[50:22] that right Amen to heal but he can't do
[50:25] that ain't got that power Ain't nobody
[50:27] got creative power but almighty God Amen
[50:30] so that philosophy is just completely
[50:33] wrong because if he could heal he could
[50:35] rais from the dead and so forth and he
[50:38] can't do that amen so God bless you this
[50:40] morning good to be in the house of the
[50:42] Lord hopefully you have been praying
[50:45] amen meditating and you I mean this
[50:47] morning I was just listening to

[50:51] seemed like everybody was at the very
[50:53] beginning kind of just real lowkey you
[50:55] know and and so forth but then it
[50:57] cranked up and everybody just really got
[50:59] in the spirit so that's good amen amen

[51:24] four different subjects really and I'm
[51:27] going to try to tie them together if I
[51:28] can with the help of the Lord amen
[51:30] because I mean it all kind of ties
[51:32] together and so amen but uh amen I
[51:35] wanted to call the first title that I
[51:38] had come up with is the Christian God

[54:20] disease but the angel of the Lord said
[54:22] to Elijah to tishbite arise go up to
[54:26] meet The Messengers of the king of
[54:28] Samaria and say unto them is it not
[54:30] because there is not a God in Israel
[54:33] that you go and inquire of be elub the
[54:36] god of Arron now therefore thus sayith
[54:39] the Lord Thou shalt not come down from
[54:41] that bed on which Thou Art gone up but
[54:43] shalt surely die and Elijah departed may
[54:47] God add His blessings to the reading of
[54:49] the words you can be seated this morning
[54:52] you know it's funny how that um
[54:55] Elijah
[54:57] amen was uh went and he told them that
[55:01] but after if you read the whole chapter
[55:03] you'll find out that the king sent about
[55:06] two captains of 50 and and the captain
[55:09] and both of those captains and the
[55:12] captains of 50 we know that uh because
[55:15] they went up to try to bring him down to
[55:17] come and meet the king is that right and
[55:20] they all got burnt is Right Elijah said
[55:23] if I be a man of God
[55:25] Amen Let Fire come down consume all of
[55:28] them and the third Captain when he came
[55:31] he came and he fell before he lied his
[55:34] feet amen I don't know about you but
[55:37] anybody would do that wouldn't they amen
[55:38] realizing that everybody up before he
[55:40] got fried amen but this one he coming
[55:43] you know and and then uh God told Elijah
[55:46] to go ahead don't be afraid go on down
[55:48] and if you read it amen really the only
[55:51] thing that it says is that Elijah told
[55:53] the King the same thing and he died it
[55:56] really didn't change anything amen amen
[56:00] but anyway so we look at this and I I I
[56:03] just want to take it from this for a for
[56:04] a minute we want to look with uh amen
[56:07] talking about uh you know uh the God
[56:11] Amen the Christian's God and also over
[56:13] in like I said I wanted to read just a
[56:16] few of them I believe it's found in um
[56:20] let me see here Isaiah 55 Isaiah 55
[56:25] we'll bring these together with the help
[56:27] of the Lord it says in verse one ho
[56:30] everyone that thirsts Come Ye to the
[56:32] waters and the that he that have no
[56:35] money Come Ye by and eat ye come buy
[56:40] wine and milk without
[56:43] money and without price wherefore do you
[56:47] spend money for that which is not bread
[56:50] and your labor for that which satisfieth
[56:52] not hearken diligently unto me and eat
[56:56] ye that which is good and let your soul
[57:00] Delight itself in fatness amen so God is
[57:06] saying come and buy now how many knows
[57:08] that whenever you go to buy something
[57:10] normally you'll go to a store somewhere
[57:13] that right you'll go to a store and I
[57:15] don't know about you but I've many times
[57:17] and I've went to places I've went to
[57:19] stores and traveled a pretty good
[57:21] distance you know and when I got there
[57:24] was
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:26] closed and I don't know about you but
[57:28] that's really really disappointing when
[57:30] you really really want something amen
[57:32] that means you're not getting what you
[57:34] wanted it's
[57:37] closed amen you're not going to get
[57:40] anything you know a amen now and Jesus
[57:44] what he said about this talking about
[57:46] coming by and eat yay come by wine and
[57:51] milk without money and without
[57:53] price praise the Lord the Lord amen I
[57:56] believe it was in
[57:58] John let me see
[58:01] here in John 6 verse
[58:05] 27 uh Jesus said unto them said verily
[58:09] verily I say unto you seek me not
[58:11] because you saw the Miracles but because
[58:14] you did eat of the Loaves and were
[58:16] filled and now notice Jesus says labor
[58:19] not for the meat that perishes for the
[58:22] but for the meat that which endureth
[58:24] unto everlasting life which the son of
[58:26] man shall give you and amen for him hath
[58:30] God the Father seal so even there Jesus
[58:34] is telling us that not to labor so much
[58:36] for the meat that perishes but amen how
[58:39] many believe you God has a food that we
[58:41] can eat amen the Christian has a food
[58:44] that they can eat amen that will sustain
[58:46] them that is so much more than just the
[58:49] natural
[58:50] food God has has has it in store he's
[58:54] got it all prepared amen and I just want
[58:58] to say Amen God's store this morning is
[59:02] not
[59:04] closed how many believe back in the 1965
[59:07] and so forth brother B when he preached
[59:09] the seals and so forth he talked about
[59:11] how SE when these uh seals are open when
[59:13] these seals are open the Mercy's over
[59:15] Mercy's over he said that many
[59:19] times come on people y all know we did
[59:23] you know we were a little confused about
[59:25] it I still don't understand it perfectly
[59:27] but there's a lot of people thought that
[59:29] Mercy was over that the store so to
[59:31] speak was
[59:33] closed but aren't you glad later on when
[59:35] that came up the prophet again says
[59:37] don't you ever believe that you believe
[59:38] that there's still Mercy there's still
[59:40] Grace oh keep working don't quit working
[59:43] people just thought that it was all over
[59:45] with but aren't you glad it wasn't over
[59:47] with I'm glad that it wasn't over with
[59:50] that there was still Mercy for God's
[59:53] Great storehouse amen didn't but B say
[59:56] that God told him to go up and store up
[1:00:00] [Applause]
