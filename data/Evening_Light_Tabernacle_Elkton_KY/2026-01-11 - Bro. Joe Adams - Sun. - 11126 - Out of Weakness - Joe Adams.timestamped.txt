[19:13] open before you, Father. Search our
[19:15] hearts, Lord. Look down into every way
[19:18] that we have, all the ways of our heart
[19:20] and all the ways of our thoughts and
[19:22] mind, Lord. and come and cleanse us from
[19:24] all impurities, Lord Jesus. This

[19:31] be so welcome this morning, Lord. Until,
[19:33] Father, your Holy Spirit would just come

[19:40] before, Lord. And that'll only be
[19:42] because of your presence, God. We're so
[19:45] grateful, Lord, to be amongst your
[19:46] children whom you have redeemed and
[19:48] bought by the precious blood of your own
[19:51] dear son, Jesus Christ. Lord, we come

[19:56] Lord, and ask, God, that you'll speak to
[19:59] us in a special way. Be with Brother
[20:01] Joe, Father. Lord, let him have a
[20:03] special gift of just getting out of the
[20:05] way. And let your Holy Spirit speak
[20:07] through him, the words of eternal life
[20:09] and what we have need of hearing, Lord.
[20:11] And we ask, God, that you'll bless this
[20:13] service in a special way, Lord, as we
[20:15] commit ourselves to you. and we give you
[20:17] honor and glory and praise Lord for how
[20:20] wonderful you are to us in Jesus name we
[20:23] ask it. Amen and amen. Good morning
[20:26] everybody.
[20:28] Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[20:30] Amen. Want to thank everybody for their
[20:32] prayers. Amen. Amen. We're over that old
[20:34] sinuses and head congestion stuff. Amen.
[20:38] So we're very glad to be feeling good
[20:39] again. Amen. So thank you for prayers.
[20:42] Amen. I think uh Amen. There's a little
[20:44] bit of it going around yet. So, amen. We
[20:46] just pray for those that are not feeling
[20:48] the greatest this morning. Amen. But
[20:50] praise the Lord. How many's looking for
[20:52] a good day in the Lord?
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Good to have the the pals with us this
[20:55] morning. God bless you. Amen. Amen. So,
[20:58] praise the Lord. Maybe we'll just have
[20:59] Bible reading at this time if you would.
[21:01] Amen.
[21:08] We'll just go in the Psalms this
[21:10] morning. We're going to Psalms 24 this
[21:12] morning.
[21:18] Psalms 24,
[21:23] the earth is the Lord's and the fullness
[21:25] thereof, the world and they that dwell
[21:27] therein.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Who shall ascend into the hill of the
[21:36] Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy
[21:38] place?
[21:48] He shall receive the blessing from the
[21:50] Lord in righteousness from God, the God
[21:52] of his salvation.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Lift up your heads, oh ye gates, and be
[22:03] ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the
[22:06] King of glory shall come in.
[22:15] Lift, lift up your heads, oh ye gates
[22:17] ever, even lift them up, ye everlasting
[22:20] doors, and the king of glory shall come
[22:22] in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord
[22:25] of hosts, he is the king of glory.
[22:28] Sailor, God bless you, brother Josh.
[22:36] Amen. I just thought we'd start out this
[22:38] morning with a praise report. Amen.
[22:40] Sister Hannah, brother Joe, they wanted
[22:41] to say Justin, our employee, made it
[22:44] through open heart surgery and his home
[22:45] recovering. He said without the prayer
[22:47] cloth, he wouldn't have made it. Please
[22:49] keep him in your prayers as he recovers.
[22:51] Amen. And also the fire at the scrapard.
[22:54] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[23:01] Amen. Also, the fire at the scrapyard
[23:03] was huge. It could have very quickly
[23:05] burnt the whole business. But God, no
[23:07] equipment, no buildings, and most
[23:09] importantly, no one was hurt. The
[23:11] publicity of the fire increased our
[23:13] customer volume 10fold. We were barely
[23:15] able to take care of everyone. Again,
[23:17] look at God. On the way to the fire, I
[23:19] told Joe, nothing, absolutely nothing,
[23:22] can happen to us without God's
[23:24] permission. We find great comfort in
[23:26] that. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[23:27] of praise.
[23:32] Amen. Let's sing how great thou art this
[23:35] morning. Let's start with the chorus.
[23:38] And then sings my soul,
[23:42] my savior
[23:45] God to thee.
[23:50] Oh, how great thou art.
[23:56] How great thou are.
[24:02] Then sings my soul,
[24:06] my Savior, your God to thee.
[24:13] Oh, how great thou are.
[24:19] How great thou are.
[24:25] And oh Lord my God,
[24:29] when I in awome wonder
[24:36] consider
[24:37] all
[24:40] the world thy hands have made.
[24:46] And I see the stars.
[24:51] I hear the rolling
[24:55] thunder.
[24:57] Thy power throughout
[25:01] the universe
[25:04] display.
[25:08] And then sings my soul,
[25:12] my savior
[25:15] God to thee.
[25:19] Oh, how great thou are.
[25:25] Oh, how great thou are.
[25:31] And then sings my soul,
[25:36] my savior God to thee.
[25:43] Oh, how great thou are.
[25:49] How great thou are. And when I think,
[25:54] oh, and when I think
[25:59] that God his son Osparine
[26:05] sent him to die,
[26:09] I scarce
[26:11] can take it in.
[26:16] that on the cross,
[26:20] my burden gladly
[26:24] buried.
[26:26] He bled and died
[26:30] and took away my sin.
[26:38] Then sings my soul,
[26:42] my Savior God to thee.
[26:49] How great thou are.
[26:55] Oh, how great thou are.
[27:01] Then sings my soul,
[27:05] my savior for God to thee.
[27:12] How great thou are.
[27:18] How great thou are.
[27:24] And when cross shall come
[27:29] with shout of alamation
[27:34] and take me home.
[27:39] What joy shall fill my heart
[27:45] and then I shall bow
[27:50] in humble adoration
[27:56] and their proclaim.
[28:01] My God, how great thou art.
[28:07] Then sings my soul,
[28:12] my savior
[28:14] God to thee.
[28:18] Oh, how great thou are.
[28:24] Oh, how great thou are.
[28:30] Then sings my soul,
[28:35] my Savior God to thee.
[28:42] How great thou are.
[28:48] How great thou art. Then sings my soul.
[28:53] Who then sings my soul?
[28:58] My savior God to thee.
[29:05] Oh, how great thou are.
[29:10] Oh, how great thou are.
[29:16] And then sings my soul,
[29:21] my savior
[29:23] God to thee.

[29:34] How great thou art. How great thou art.
[29:39] Oh, how great thou are.

[29:48] thou are.

[39:17] before we go to prayer this morning?
[39:20] Start with the first verse. I have a
[39:24] source
[39:26] of strength
[39:28] when I am weak.
[39:34] That takes me through.
[39:38] When life is pressing
[39:42] me
[39:45] and I have a source
[39:50] of power
[39:52] from above.
[39:57] I'm covered
[39:59] over
[40:02] by a shield of love.
[40:07] Oh, and I claim the blood
[40:13] Jesus shed on Calary.
[40:20] And those precious blood stains
[40:25] were made there just for me.
[40:32] for all my sin,
[40:36] my sickness,
[40:38] and my pain.
[40:43] When I need healing,
[40:49] those precious blood stains
[40:54] and I do not know
[40:59] how others
[41:01] make it through,
[41:06] who never
[41:08] go
[41:10] to Calary.
[41:13] as I do.
[41:17] For there's a healing
[41:22] cleansing
[41:25] which flows
[41:29] with peace that only
[41:34] his redeemed can know.
[41:40] So I claim the blood
[41:45] Jesus shed on Calary.
[41:52] And those precious blood stains
[41:57] were made there just for me.
[42:04] for all my sins,
[42:08] my sickness,
[42:10] and my pain.
[42:16] When I need healing,
[42:20] I claim those preious blood stains. Can
[42:25] we sing that first verse again? I have a
[42:29] source
[42:32] of strength when I am weak.
[42:39] That takes me through.
[42:43] When life is pressing me
[42:50] and I have the source
[42:54] of power
[42:57] from up above
[43:01] and I'm covered over
[43:07] by your shield of blood.
[43:12] Oh, and I claim the blood
[43:17] Jesus shed on Calary.
[43:25] Those precious blood stains
[43:29] were made there just for me.
[43:36] for all my sin,
[43:41] my sickness,
[43:43] and my pain.
[43:48] When I need healing,
[43:52] I claim those precious blood stains.
[44:00] When I need healing,
[44:04] I claim
[44:06] those preious
[44:09] blood stains.
[44:12] Amen. How many has a need this morning?
[44:15] Amen. You believe he's here to meet it.
[44:17] Amen. You may have your seats and we're
[44:19] going to invite the brothers for the
[44:20] offering. Brother Danny and brother
[44:21] Michael John, Brother Paul, if you'd
[44:23] come this time.
[44:26] Amen.
[44:28] We have no written prayer requests this
[44:29] morning, but just enjoying the presence
[44:31] of the Lord. Amen. Just come expecting
[44:35] to hear what brother Joe the Lord's laid
[44:36] on brother Joe's heart. And dad, I
[44:38] wonder if you'd stand up and can you
[44:40] pray for us this morning? Open the
[44:41] service.
[48:09] Sister Annabelle is a special this
[48:11] morning as she comes. Let's sing. I'm
[48:12] redeemed. Bought with a price. Start
[48:15] with the chorus.
[48:17] Well, I am redeemed
[48:21] and I've been bought with the price
[48:27] for Jesus
[48:29] has changed my whole life.
[48:36] If anybody
[48:38] asks you to just who I am,
[48:45] will tell them
[48:47] I am redeemed.
[48:53] Sister Jessica, if you want to come
[48:54] right after. Great.
[49:20] Sometimes I fall
[49:23] to my knees and pray.
[49:28] Come Jesus come.
[49:32] Let be the day.
[49:36] Sometimes I feel
[49:40] like I'm going to break
[49:45] but I'm holding on
[49:49] to a
[49:52] f.
[49:54] Come Jesus come.
[49:58] We've been waiting so long
[50:02] for the day you return to heal every
[50:07] hurt and rot every wrong.
[50:14] We need you right now.
[50:18] Come and turn this around.
[50:22] Deep down I know this world isn't home.
[50:27] Come Jesus come.
[50:32] And there will be no war
[50:35] and there will be no chase
[50:40] when Jesus comes.
[50:43] So let be the day
[50:47] you come for the weak
[50:51] and the strong just the same.
[50:56] and all will believe
[51:00] in the power of his name.
[51:05] Come Jesus, come.
[51:09] We've been waiting so long
[51:14] for the day you return to heal every
[51:18] hurt and brought every wrong.
[51:25] We need you right now.
[51:28] Come and turn this around.
[51:33] Deep down I know this world isn't home.
[51:38] Come Jesus come.
[51:43] Come Jesus come.
[51:47] One day you'll come
[51:51] and we'll stand face to face.
[51:55] Come and lay it all down
[51:59] cuz I'm on
[52:01] today.
[52:03] The time is right now.
[52:07] There's no need to wait.
[52:11] Your path will be washed
[52:14] by rivers of grace.
[52:18] Come Jesus, come.
[52:22] We've been waiting so long
[52:27] for the day you return to heal every
[52:31] hurt and rot every wrong.
[52:37] We need you right now.

[52:57] Come Jesus come.
[53:03] Come Jesus come.
[53:43] I turn left
[53:46] when I should have gone right.
[53:52] I chose a winding road that led me into
[53:56] the night.
[54:00] Warning signs,
[54:03] flashed bridges out,
[54:08] and then I heard a voice say, "Stop and
[54:12] turn around.
[54:17] The turn is where I first met Christ.
[54:21] The turn is where I saw the light. And I
[54:26] left it all behind when I made the turn.
[54:34] And there I was made new again. That
[54:39] place is where it all began. And I'll
[54:43] never forget that day when I made the
[54:51] life a ride
[54:54] with its mountains and curves
[55:00] and on this road of life we slowly reap
[55:04] and hurt.
[55:08] Still today,
[55:12] there is hope to be found
[55:17] and it's found in Jesus Christ. Child,
[55:21] turn around.
[55:26] The turn is where I first met Christ.
[55:30] The turn is where I saw the light. And I
[55:35] left it all behind when I made the turn.
[55:43] And there I was made new again. The
[55:48] places where it all began. And I'll
[55:52] never forget that day when I made the
[55:56] turn.
[56:01] The turn is where I first met Christ.
[56:05] The turn is where I saw the light. And I
[56:10] left it all behind when I made the turn.
[56:18] And there I was made new again. That
[56:23] place is where it all began. And I'll
[56:27] never forget that day when I made the
[56:31] turn.
[56:36] And I'll never forget that day
[56:41] when I made that turn.
[56:57] appreciate those songs this morning.
[57:00] Amen. Before I turn it over to brother
[57:01] Brad, let's sing Mercy Rewrote my life
[57:04] this morning.
[57:08] Oh, mercy
[57:12] renew
[57:14] my life.
[57:19] God's mercy
[57:22] ruled my life.
[57:29] And I should have fallen,
[57:34] my soul
[57:36] cast down,
[57:39] but mercy
[57:42] reroll
[57:44] my life. Let's stand and sing it again.
[57:48] Oh God's mercy
[57:52] renew my life.
[57:58] Oh God's mercy
[58:02] rer my life.
[58:07] Oh and I should have fallen.
[58:14] My soul
[58:16] cast down
[58:18] but mercy
[58:22] rerro
[58:24] my life.
[58:28] Amen. Aren't you thankful this morning
[58:30] for God's mercy?
[58:32] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful atmosphere and and
[58:34] presence that we're in this morning. How
[58:36] many believes that whatever you have
[58:37] need of this morning, the Lord can meet?
[58:40] Amen. I certainly certainly believe that
[58:42] with all my heart. And and if if you're
[58:44] in need of healing, he's a healer. If
[58:46] you're in need of deliverance, he's a
[58:48] deliverer. If you're in need of
[58:50] salvation, he's a salvation giving God.
[58:53] Praise the Lord.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] Hallelujah.
[59:00] What a beautiful Lord we have.
[59:03] I tell you what, we're we're certainly
[59:05] thankful and and just to have Brother
[59:06] Joe, Sister Jessica, and their family
[59:08] with us. And you know, Brother Joe, he's
[59:10] he just every time he comes, he yields
[59:12] himself to the Lord. And I I'm fortunate
[59:15] enough to be able to to hang out and
[59:17] fellowship with him. And and I see his
[59:19] sincerity and his dedication and and the
[59:22] love and the time and the effort that he
[59:23] puts into seeking what God would have in
[59:26] store for us. He sacrifices so that we
[59:29] can be blessed. And every time Brother
[59:30] Joe comes, we just we're blessed, aren't
[59:32] we, church?
[59:33] &gt;&gt; So thankful to have Brother Joe with us.
[59:35] And why don't we just sing that again as
[59:37] we turn the service to him and let him
[59:38] have his liberty. How many will pull?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Pull on the gift of God and see if God
[59:42] don't move down your aisle this morning.
[59:45] Hallelujah. Oh mercy,
[59:49] it rerode
[59:51] my life.
[59:56] Oh mercy
[59:59] rroad
[1:00:01] my life.
[1:00:06] Oh, I should have fallen.
[1:00:13] Appreciate that. Cast down,
[1:00:16] but mercy.
[1:00:20] Rote
[1:00:22] my life.
[1:00:25] Aren't you thankful for that mercy?
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Rewrote your life.
[1:00:30] If it wasn't for his mercy, where would
[1:00:32] we be this morning?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[1:00:36] Father, we humble ourselves before you
[1:00:39] today, Lord, and want to say thank you
[1:00:40] for your mercy and grace. Truly, Lord,
[1:00:44] it's nothing that we as humans bring.
[1:00:47] Lord, we bring failures and we bring our
[1:00:50] shortcomings and Lord, we bring our
[1:00:52] insecurities, Father. We bring our
[1:00:54] weaknesses, God.
[1:00:57] But Lord, we bring those things to your
[1:00:59] altar today into your presence, Lord.
[1:01:05] And we ask that you move today, Father.
[1:01:09] God, we ask that you would just draw
[1:01:11] from us, Lord,
[1:01:14] that which you have need of to manifest
[1:01:16] yourself in a greater way this morning.
[1:01:20] Father, I feel your presence here and
[1:01:21] I'm asking, Lord, that I just yield my
[1:01:24] vessel to you, my lips,
[1:01:27] my body, Lord, my thoughts, and Lord, we
[1:01:30] just give it over to you this morning
[1:01:32] that you would be the guest speaker.
[1:01:34] Lord,
[1:01:36] I ask that you'd anoint the hearts of
[1:01:38] the people, Lord, today to hear what
[1:01:41] your spirit would had to be said.
[1:01:42] Father, we love you now. We just commit
[1:01:45] this service into your care into your
[1:01:47] hands this morning. We want to be
[1:01:49] obedient servants, Lord, both listener
[1:01:52] and speaker. We ask in Jesus' name.
[1:01:55] Amen. Well, God bless you this morning.
[1:01:59] See, I got my pulling crew on the front
[1:02:01] row this morning. And we got a new
[1:02:03] recruit up here, Brother Lyric. Awesome.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:12] We got the pulling squad on the front.
[1:02:14] So, hey, anybody, you're welcome to join
[1:02:16] us,
[1:02:18] right, boys?
[1:02:20] Amen. That's when we say amen. Amen.
[1:02:24] Well, we bring greetings to you today
[1:02:25] from our pastor, brother Tim and the
[1:02:27] saints there at Evening Light. And I'm
[1:02:29] happy to have my family with me and
[1:02:31] happy to see my my daughter Lauren and
[1:02:34] my son-in-law, Weston, and spend some
[1:02:36] time with them. It's always good to be
[1:02:38] here with you and spending time with you
[1:02:40] as well and see all your familiar faces.
[1:02:43] But today, we just want to turn to the
[1:02:45] word. And the Lord's kind of giving me a
[1:02:47] thought this morning. I want to speak to
[1:02:48] you on out of weakness.
[1:02:51] Now, I'm sure nobody in the room today
[1:02:53] has any of those. But out of weakness,
[1:02:56] and we find here in Hebrews 11 and verse
[1:02:59] 32, we're going to start there. We're
[1:03:01] going to read down through verse 40. And
[1:03:02] I hope everybody is going to be patient
[1:03:05] this morning. Nobody's in a rush.
[1:03:07] Uh
[1:03:09] but I just want to just deliver my heart
[1:03:10] the way the Lord has given us to us. But
[1:03:12] it says here, "And what shall I say
[1:03:15] more? For time would fail me to tell of
[1:03:18] Gideon and of Barack and Samson and
[1:03:21] Jeffa
[1:03:23] and of David also and Samuel and of the
[1:03:25] prophets who through faith subdued
[1:03:28] kingdoms and wrought righteousness,
[1:03:30] obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
[1:03:32] lions, quenched the violence of fire,
[1:03:35] escaped the edge of the sword, and out
[1:03:37] of weakness
[1:03:39] were made strong. They waxed valiant in
[1:03:43] in fight and turned to flight the armies
[1:03:45] of the aliens. Women received their dead
[1:03:48] raised to life again. And others were
[1:03:50] tortured, not accepting deliverance,
[1:03:52] that they might obtain a better
[1:03:54] resurrection. And others had trial of
[1:03:57] cruel mockings and scourgings, yay,
[1:03:58] moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.
[1:04:02] And they were stoned. They were swn
[1:04:04] aunder. They were tempted. They were
[1:04:05] slain with a sword. And they wondered
[1:04:08] about in sheep skins and goat skins
[1:04:10] being destitute, afflicted and
[1:04:11] tormented. And the Bible says of whom
[1:04:13] the world is not worthy of. They
[1:04:16] wondered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:04:18] in dens and caves of the earth. And all
[1:04:21] these and and these all having obtained
[1:04:23] a good report through faith received not
[1:04:26] the promise. God having provided some
[1:04:29] better thing for us that they without us
[1:04:32] should not be made perfect. God bless
[1:04:34] you. You can have your seats this
[1:04:35] morning.
[1:04:37] I said I as I said I want to speak to
[1:04:39] you on out of weakness and we look here
[1:04:41] in this chapter of Hebrews as we recall
[1:04:45] this is the chapter of faith or the
[1:04:47] heroes of faith men and women who have
[1:04:49] done courageous things notable things so
[1:04:53] notable that we're even reading about
[1:04:55] these things again today but you know
[1:04:58] many times when we read or at least let
[1:05:00] me speak from my viewpoint when I read
[1:05:02] Hebrews 11 I think my what great men and
[1:05:06] great women.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; And I think to myself, and I ponder, if
[1:05:10] I would have lived back then,
[1:05:12] would I have been inscribed in Hebrews
[1:05:14] 11? Would it have been found to me to
[1:05:17] have my name placed there with Jeffa and
[1:05:20] Gideon and these great men and great
[1:05:23] women, those who were tortured and
[1:05:26] didn't accept deliverance? Would I would
[1:05:28] have received that kind of torture? Or
[1:05:30] would I have recanted the faith?
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Or would I have allowed myself to be
[1:05:36] stoned and swn aunder and COULD I FACED
[1:05:39] TRIALS AND MOCKINGS and scourgings? Or
[1:05:42] would I have allowed my family to be
[1:05:43] slain in front of me? or even for us to
[1:05:46] wander around in sheep skins and goat
[1:05:49] skins, no place to call home, POOR AND
[1:05:51] DESTITUTE. WOULD I HAVE BEEN THAT
[1:05:54] PERSON?
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Could I have made it through the
[1:05:59] difficulties that they made it through?
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; I want to bring this home to us this
[1:06:04] morning. And we READ THIS CHAPTER AND WE
[1:06:06] THINK, MAN, THEY'VE DONE extraordinary
[1:06:08] things. How did they do it? and how
[1:06:13] could they do what they did?
[1:06:16] But if you read chapter 11, you'll find
[1:06:19] the key lays in the scripture.
[1:06:23] There is one certain trait that lays in
[1:06:26] the scripture with all humanity that we
[1:06:29] all possess.
[1:06:32] See, IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY HAD SOME
[1:06:34] superpower and yet they did. It wasn't
[1:06:38] because they were superhuman and and
[1:06:40] possess any special gifts. Yet, they
[1:06:43] did. WE FIND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
[1:06:46] CHARACTERS IN THE BIBLE THAT WE WE WE we
[1:06:49] fantasize over today like a Superman or
[1:06:51] a Spider-Man or Captain America. WE'RE
[1:06:54] NOT TALKING ABOUT THOSE TYPE OF
[1:06:56] SUPERNATURAL POWERS, BUT WE'RE TALKING
[1:06:58] ABOUT MEN AND women that are just
[1:07:01] ordinary like you and I. AMEN.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; AND THEIR LIVES MAY VARY FROM OUR LIVES.
[1:07:06] THEIR STRUGGLES MAY VARY FROM OUR
[1:07:08] STRUGGLES. THEIR TRIALS MAY BE DIFFERENT
[1:07:10] THAN the trials that we face. But yet
[1:07:12] THERE WAS A UNIQUE QUALITY THAT EACH OF
[1:07:15] THEM POSSESS. AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU,
[1:07:17] AND YOU POSSESS IT TODAY AS WELL. YOU
[1:07:20] SAY, "WHAT IS THAT QUALITY, BROTHER?
[1:07:22] WHAT IS THAT THAT I POSSESS THAT'LL PUT
[1:07:24] ME IN THE HEROES OF FAITH CHAPTER?" IT'S
[1:07:27] CALLED WEAKNESS.
[1:07:32] WEAKNESS IS A QUALITY THAT EACH OF YOU
[1:07:35] THIS MORNING, WHETHER YOU'RE A YOUNG
[1:07:37] MAN, A YOUNG BOY, WHETHER YOU'RE AN
[1:07:39] OLDER PERSON THIS MORNING, EACH OF US
[1:07:42] POSSESS WEAKNESS.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; But many of us, our human nature is to
[1:07:48] hide from it
[1:07:52] and conceal it.
[1:07:54] BUT THE BIBLE SAYS IT'S OUT of weakness
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; were made strong.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT WAS OUT OF WEAKNESS THAT THEY
[1:08:04] BEC THAT THEY could become men and women
[1:08:07] of faith.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And it's out of our weakness that we're
[1:08:11] going to be men and women of faith. You
[1:08:15] know, people today, brother Thomas, THEY
[1:08:17] WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE GREAT THINGS
[1:08:19] THAT they done. And man, we've done this
[1:08:21] and WE'VE DONE THAT. AND YOU KNOW, WE
[1:08:23] NEVER WANT TO EXPLOIT our weaknesses,
[1:08:27] BUT WE WANT TO EXPLOIT THE THINGS THAT
[1:08:29] WE DO OURSELVES THAT WE'RE GOOD AT,
[1:08:31] RIGHT? The things that we we ARE EXPERTS
[1:08:33] AT. OH, I CAN DO THIS. AND YOU KNOW, IF
[1:08:35] I HAD ANY kind of expertise, I'm an
[1:08:37] Excel wizard. Some of you probably like,
[1:08:40] what is Excel? Don't worry about it. But
[1:08:43] I've done it for 20SOME YEARS. I'M A
[1:08:45] MASTER OF IT. I CAN DO SO MUCH WITH IT.
[1:08:47] BUT YET THERE'S THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT I
[1:08:50] HAVE WEAKNESSES. AND IF WE'RE ALL HONEST
[1:08:52] THIS MORNING, WE EACH OF US, EACH AND
[1:08:54] EVERYONE, NO MATTER HOW GREAT WE WANT
[1:08:57] TO, YOU KNOW, IMAGINE OURSELVES, we have
[1:09:00] human weaknesses.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; But it was out of their weaknesses that
[1:09:06] they be become strong. Because notice,
[1:09:09] they didn't rely on their own human
[1:09:11] abilities. THEIR FAITH DID NOT RELY ON
[1:09:14] WHAT THEY COULD BRING TO GOD, BUT THEIR
[1:09:16] FAITH RELIED NOT IN THEMSELVES, NOT ON
[1:09:19] THEIR ABILITIES, BUT THEIR FAITH RELIED
[1:09:22] IN THE WORD OF GOD. AND THAT'S THE SAME
[1:09:24] PLACE THAT OUR FAITH MUST RELY TODAY.
[1:09:28] IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO. IT'S
[1:09:30] NOT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN BRING. OUR
[1:09:32] FAITH RELIES RIGHT HERE, CHURCH, ON WHAT
[1:09:35] THE WORD SAYS FOR US THIS EVENING OR
[1:09:38] THIS MORNING. WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN
[1:09:41] DECLARED RIGHTEOUS. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN
[1:09:43] DECLARED PURCHASED. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN
[1:09:45] DECLARED SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. NOT
[1:09:48] BECAUSE WE MERITED IT, BUT BECAUSE HE
[1:09:50] DONE IT FOR US.
[1:09:52] IT'S A FINISHED WORK THIS MORNING.
[1:09:57] BUT THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US BY FAITH,
[1:10:02] BY FAITH, THEY DONE THESE GREAT THINGS.
[1:10:06] And let's just read about some of them.
[1:10:09] I hope you're okay this morning.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Some of you looking at me like a mule of
[1:10:13] this looking through a new gate.
[1:10:16] Come on, put a smile on YOUR FACE. BUT
[1:10:19] WE LOOK HERE IN HEBREWS 11:4. BY FAITH,
[1:10:22] ABEL OFFERED UNTO GOD a more excellent
[1:10:25] sacrifice THAN CAIN. BY FAITH, ENOCH WAS
[1:10:29] TRANSLATED THAT HE SHOULDN'T SEE DEATH.
[1:10:31] BY FAITH, NOAH BEING WARNED of God of
[1:10:34] things not seen OF YET, WAS MOVED WITH
[1:10:36] FEAR AND PREPARED AN FOR THE SAVING OF
[1:10:38] HIS HOUSE, BY WHICH HE CONDEMNED THE
[1:10:40] WORLD AND became the heir OF
[1:10:41] RIGHTEOUSNESS, WHICH IS BY FAITH. And in
[1:10:45] VERSE 9, SPEAKING OF ABRAHAM, BY FAITH
[1:10:47] HE SOJOURNED IN a land of promise. VERSE
[1:10:50] 11. AND THROUGH FAITH ALSO Sarah herself
[1:10:53] received strength to conceive and WAS
[1:10:56] DELIVERED OF A CHILD WHEN SHE WAS PAST
[1:10:58] AGE BECAUSE SHE JUDGED HIM FAITHFUL WHO
[1:11:01] MADE THE PROMISE. BY FAITH ISAAC BLESSED
[1:11:04] JACOB AND ESAU CONCERNING THINGS TO
[1:11:06] COME. BY FAITH JACOB WHEN HE WAS DYING
[1:11:09] BLESSED BOTH the sons Joseph or blessed
[1:11:12] both the sons of Joseph and worshiped
[1:11:14] leaning upon his staff. Then we go down
[1:11:16] TO VERSE 24. AND BY FAITH MOSES WHEN HE
[1:11:19] WAS COME TO YEARS,
[1:11:21] speaking about young man coming to
[1:11:23] manhood, WHEN HE HAD COME TO YEARS, HE
[1:11:25] REFUSED TO BE CALLED THE son of
[1:11:28] Pharaoh's daughter. NOTICE IN VERSE 31,
[1:11:32] BY FAITH THE HARLOT RAHAB PERISHED NOT
[1:11:34] WITH THEM THAT BELIEVE not when she
[1:11:36] received the spies with peace.
[1:11:40] And it says, what more shall I say?
[1:11:42] YEAH.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; FOR TIME WOULD FAIL me to tell of the
[1:11:47] Ron Spencers of the world, of the Edis
[1:11:50] of the world, of the great MEN THAT HAS
[1:11:52] STOOD, GREAT SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS OF
[1:11:54] GOD THAT HAS STOOD FOR THIS WORD AND
[1:11:56] STOOD. MEN LIKE GIDEON AND BARACK AND
[1:11:59] SAMSON AND JEFFA AND DAVID AND SAMUEL
[1:12:01] AND ALL THE PROPHETS WHO THROUGH FAITH
[1:12:04] SUBDUED KINGDOMS AND WROTE RIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:12:06] AND OBTAINED PROMISES AND STOPPED THE
[1:12:08] MOUTHS OF LIONS. THEY QUENCHED THE
[1:12:10] VIOLENCE OF FIRE. THEY ESCAPED THE EDGE
[1:12:13] OF THE SWORD AND OUT OF WEAKNESS
[1:12:16] THEY WERE MADE STRONG CHURCH. NOT GREAT
[1:12:19] SUPERNATURAL PEOPLE BUT EVERY DAY MEN
[1:12:22] AND WOMEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD
[1:12:24] YIELDING THEIR WEAKNESS TO GOD THAT HE
[1:12:26] THROUGH THEM COULD BECOME STRONG.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT YOU TO SHUN YOUR
[1:12:33] WEAKNESS. He wants you to surrender it
[1:12:35] to him. Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Each one of these carried a human
[1:12:42] weakness. Sarah,
[1:12:45] her faith wasn't always perfect. Brother
[1:12:47] Troy,
[1:12:48] she laughed at God.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Jacob was a moneyhungry shyer.
[1:13:00] deceived his own brother
[1:13:04] just to get up that corporate ladder.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Moses, oh, come on. Had a temper.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; It's okay to have a temper. Just don't
[1:13:15] let it loose.
[1:13:18] Cuz God can take that and channel it
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; and man put YOU AS A MAD DOLL FOR THE
[1:13:24] KINGDOM OF GOD.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; HE HAD A TEMPER, KILLED A MAN. and also
[1:13:29] had a speech impediment. So don't tell
[1:13:32] me you can't do something for God
[1:13:33] because you can't talk.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Rahab was a harlot
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; made a living
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; that way.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Gideon, NOTICE GIDEON, WE FIND THE BIBLE
[1:13:50] WOULD TELL US, "THOU mighty man of
[1:13:52] valor."
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, Gideon. AND GIDEON QUESTIONED GOD
[1:13:56] AND QUESTIONED GOD AND WANTED TO BE
[1:13:58] REASSURED. YOU KNOW, LIKE SOME OF YOU
[1:14:00] OUT THERE, GOD, I NEED TO KNOW. GIVE ME
[1:14:02] A SIGN. GIVE ME A SIGN. GIVE ME A SIGN.
[1:14:04] GIVE ME A SIGN. LET THIS FLEECE DO THIS
[1:14:06] AND LET THIS FLEECE DO THAT. AND ALWAYS
[1:14:08] GOING BEFORE GOD TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOD'S
[1:14:10] PERFECT WILL.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; THEN WE FIND ABOUT BAYACK. BAY WAS
[1:14:15] CALLED TO LEAD AND DELIVER GOD'S PEOPLE
[1:14:18] OF ISRAEL, BUT HE HAD TO GO ON THE
[1:14:20] STRENGTH OF A WOMAN, DEBORAH. HE WASN'T
[1:14:24] GOING TO LET DEBORAH WENT WITH HIM.
[1:14:27] They weren't even husband and wife.
[1:14:30] BUT WE FIND SAMSON HAD A weakness for
[1:14:33] women.
[1:14:36] Samson gave his strength to God, but he
[1:14:38] gave his weakness over to women. See,
[1:14:42] like each of us today, they had no
[1:14:45] strengths,
[1:14:46] brother Austin, that they could rely on.
[1:14:48] were ordinary humans
[1:14:51] who possessed extraordinary faith.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; See, and it was their weakness that
[1:14:58] strengthened their faith with allow
[1:15:00] which allowed them to do great exploits.
[1:15:04] And I know you say, "Well, what about
[1:15:05] faith? What is so good about faith?"
[1:15:07] Well, I say if you were going to be
[1:15:09] executed tomorrow
[1:15:11] and they've already signed the execution
[1:15:14] agreement,
[1:15:16] WHAT WOULD FAITH DO FOR YOU? FAITH COULD
[1:15:18] SIGN YOUR PARDON.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And for many of you, faith has already
[1:15:24] signed your pardon cuz you WAS GOING TO
[1:15:26] A DEVIL'S HELL AND A SINNER'S GRAVE. BUT
[1:15:29] GOD STEPPED IN AND FAITH FAITH IN WHAT
[1:15:33] HE DONE FOR YOU SIGNED YOUR PARDON. NOW
[1:15:36] YOU DON'T LONGER HAVE TO GO THAT ROUTE.
[1:15:39] And brother B WILL TELL US SO IF FEAR IS
[1:15:41] NO GOOD AT ALL NO VALUE IN IT LET'S
[1:15:43] DISREGARD IT ALL TOGETHER and let's have
[1:15:46] faith and believe God. SEE SO IS BY
[1:15:49] FAITH WE KNOW GOD NOT by knowledge.
[1:15:54] So no matter how much you know of God
[1:15:58] because you have people today, oh they
[1:15:59] know all man they know the Bible
[1:16:02] backwards and forwards quiver from
[1:16:04] quiver to quiver
[1:16:07] but yet they don't know God personally.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; They know of God
[1:16:13] but they don't know God. So it's not how
[1:16:15] much you know of God. It's you got to
[1:16:17] know God personally. You got to have
[1:16:19] faith. The Bible tells us in Hebrews
[1:16:21] 11:6, "Without faith
[1:16:25] it's impossible to please him."
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God, notice
[1:16:30] church, HE THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST FIRST
[1:16:34] believe that he is
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:16:39] diligently seek him. So notice HERE THAT
[1:16:42] WORD IMPOSSIBLE MEANS IMPOTENT,
[1:16:45] POWERLESS, WEAKLY, UNABLE TO be done.
[1:16:50] So, in order to get ANYWHERE WITH GOD,
[1:16:53] YOU MUST FIRST BELIEVE GOD. AND YOU MUST
[1:16:57] KNOW THAT GOD SAID THAT HE WILL DO WHAT
[1:16:59] HE SAYS HE WILL DO. LET ME JUST SAY IT
[1:17:01] LIKE THIS. MY KIDS KNOW THAT. HEY, I MAY
[1:17:04] I got paid on Friday.
[1:17:07] How many of y'all get paid on Friday?
[1:17:10] Okay, some of y'all don't get paid, I
[1:17:11] guess, on Friday. MAYBE NOT. BUT WHEN I
[1:17:14] GET WHEN I USED TO GET PAID, NOW THIS IS
[1:17:16] JUST ANALOGY. This is a story. This may
[1:17:18] not be true. It may have some truth in
[1:17:20] it. So my kids, y'all can just kind of
[1:17:22] like, okay, dad's going one of them
[1:17:23] tangents. But you KNOW, THEY KNOW, HEY,
[1:17:25] PAYDAY IS TODAY.
[1:17:28] THEY GOT SOMETHING THEY SEEN AT WALMART
[1:17:30] OR THE DOLLAR GENERAL,
[1:17:33] TJ Maxx, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THEY WANT,
[1:17:37] HEY, WE GOT PAID TODAY. HALLELUJAH. AND
[1:17:40] AIN'T THE DADDY GOT PAID. WE GOT PAID.
[1:17:43] SEE, THEY THEY THEY THEY ALLOW
[1:17:45] THEMSELVES TO BE A PART OF THE EQUATION.
[1:17:47] THEN TODAY'S A GOOD DAY. DADDY GOT PAID
[1:17:50] TODAY. SO, WE GOT PAID. THAT THING THAT
[1:17:52] I HAVE MY OWN. I CAN GO TO DADDY SAY,
[1:17:54] "DADDY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT." AND
[1:17:56] GUESS WHAT? WE'RE GOING TO TOWN TODAY.
[1:17:58] LET ME JUST SEE IF I CAN MOVE DADDY TO
[1:18:00] COME INTO TJ MAXX WITH ME. WE CAN WALK
[1:18:02] DOWN TO DADDY. WON'T THIS LOOK SO good
[1:18:04] on me?
[1:18:06] AND YOU KNOW WHAT DADDY DOES? OH, YEAH.
[1:18:08] HONEY, YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK GOOD IN
[1:18:10] THAT. AND DADDY JUST MOVED WITH
[1:18:11] COMPASSION AND HE GOES UP TO THE
[1:18:13] CHECKOUT COUNTER AND HE PAYS FOR IT. BUT
[1:18:16] CAN I TELL YOU LIKE THIS THIS MORNING?
[1:18:17] IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH GOD. WE GOT
[1:18:20] PAYDAY TODAY. OUR GOD IS SITTING ON THE
[1:18:22] THRONE TODAY, CHURCH. AND BY FAITH, WE
[1:18:25] CAN WALK UP TO THE COUNTER AND
[1:18:27] EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE NEED OF, IT'S
[1:18:30] THERE FOR THE TAKING OUT THIS MORNING.
[1:18:37] BROTHER JOE HAS A SAYING, SHAKE AND
[1:18:39] BAKE.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; TELL THEM SHAKE AND BAKE 33%.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; OR $33 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; YOU GO TO THAT that that yard of his and
[1:18:54] say that you're going to get $33 in
[1:18:57] cash.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] Come on, CHURCH. YOU MAY LOOK, I BROUGHT
[1:19:05] A A 4 CENT CAN THE OTHER DAY,
[1:19:09] went up to his yard, ME AND BRAD. I
[1:19:11] DIDN'T HAD NOTHING IN MY HAND BUT A COKE
[1:19:13] CAN, BUT I WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE WITH A
[1:19:15] COKE CAN.
[1:19:18] I didn't know all about all the shake
[1:19:19] and bake till I left.
[1:19:22] Man, I'll turn that Coke can four cents
[1:19:24] in $33.
[1:19:27] But people know when they go to his
[1:19:29] yard, they can say that they can expect
[1:19:32] something in return.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; And so many times we let our human
[1:19:36] weakness get us out of conflict with God
[1:19:40] or out of ability to get something from
[1:19:42] God that we know we have need of.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; But see, he must be a rewarder of them
[1:19:49] that diligently seek after him.
[1:19:52] And brother Joe rewards those that come
[1:19:54] and says these phrases and mentions
[1:19:57] these things. He He's a rewarder. He's a
[1:19:59] man of his word. And if he is A HUMAN
[1:20:01] MAN, A NATURAL MAN CAN BE THAT GOOD TO
[1:20:04] OTHER MEN. WHAT ABOUT OUR HEAVENLY
[1:20:06] FATHER TO THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE NEED
[1:20:07] OF THIS MORNING? OH, HE KNOWS YOU HAVE A
[1:20:10] WEAKNESS. HE KNOWS YOU HAVE FAILURES. HE
[1:20:12] KNOWS YOU HAVE FLAWS. BUT YET, HE KNOWS
[1:20:14] HE'S PROVIDED FOR YOU IN THIS HOUR.
[1:20:18] SO, WE MUST COME AND WE MUST BELIEVE
[1:20:20] THAT GOD IS AND HE'S ABLE TO HEAL. HE'S
[1:20:22] ABLE TO SAVE. HE'S ABLE TO DELIVER. HE'S
[1:20:25] STILL ABLE TO SET FREE. HE'S ABLE TO
[1:20:27] RESTORE THIS MORNING. RESTORE BROKEN
[1:20:30] HOMES. RESTORE BROKEN MARRIAGES. RESTORE
[1:20:33] BROKEN CHURCHES. HE'S STILL A RESTORER
[1:20:35] THIS MORNING, CHURCH.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; I look AROUND AND I SEE WHAT GOD HAS
[1:20:42] RESTORED RIGHT HERE.
[1:20:47] YOU WANT PROOF? LOOK AROUND, CHURCH.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; PROOF IS HERE THIS MORNING THAT HE IS
[1:20:53] STILL ABLE. HE'S A REWARDER THIS MORNING
[1:20:56] FOR THEM THAT DILIGENTLY seek after him.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet OF GOD SAID, "IF YOU
[1:21:01] CRAVE THE HOLY GHOST, that shows there's
[1:21:04] a fountain open somewhere filled with
[1:21:06] the Holy Ghost." YOUNG PERSON, HOW MANY
[1:21:08] OF YOU WANT THE HOLY Ghost this morning?
[1:21:11] THEN THAT THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A
[1:21:13] FOUNTAIN OF THE HOLY GHOST FOR YOU. HE
[1:21:15] SAID YOU COULDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT DESIRE.
[1:21:17] BUT BUT FIRST THERE CAME A CREATOR TO
[1:21:19] CREATE THAT DESIRE IN YOU. I'M HERE TO
[1:21:22] TELL YOU THIS MORNING THOUGH YOU GOT
[1:21:23] WEAKNESSES, YOUNG MEN, BUT GOD HAS GIVEN
[1:21:26] YOU A DESIRE FOR THE HOLY GHOST. THERE'S
[1:21:28] GOT TO BE A HOLY GHOST SOMEWHERE.
[1:21:30] THERE'S GOT TO BE HEALING SOMEWHERE.
[1:21:33] THERE'S GOT TO BE DELIVERANCE SOMEWHERE.
[1:21:35] AND GOD IS OBLIGATED TO LEAD YOU TO IT.
[1:21:42] GOD IS OBLIGATED.
[1:21:44] If you got a desire this morning for
[1:21:46] deliverance, for restoration, for
[1:21:49] healing, for the Holy Ghost, God is
[1:21:52] obligated to deliver you
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; to heal you, TO FILL YOU, TO SAVE YOU.
[1:21:59] If you have a desire,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; see, he said there has to be a creator
[1:22:11] to create that creation.
[1:22:14] Then there has to be something out there
[1:22:16] to respond to that creation.
[1:22:21] You know, we say it like this. Well, if
[1:22:22] God would take this from me,
[1:22:25] if God would TAKE THIS FROM ME, AND GOD
[1:22:28] WOULD TAKE, WE WANT GOD TO TAKE
[1:22:29] EVERYTHING FROM US.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAYS, LISTEN, YOU'RE PROBABLY
[1:22:35] SAY, GOD DOESN'T PUSH YOU THROUGH A
[1:22:37] LITTLE PIPE, PULL YOU OUT THE OTHER
[1:22:40] SIDE, AND YOU SAY, "BLESS GOD, I
[1:22:42] OVERCAME." YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
[1:22:45] HIM. GOD PUSHED YOU THROUGH. HE SAID,
[1:22:47] "BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR
[1:22:50] YOURSELF.
[1:22:52] YOU WANT GOD TO DO SOMETHING, STEP OUT
[1:22:54] ON FAITH TONIGHT OR THIS MORNING RATHER
[1:22:57] AND BELIEVE GOD THAT HE WILL REWARD YOUR
[1:22:59] FAITH. YOU TAKE A STEP, HE'LL TAKE A
[1:23:02] STEP.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD IS UNDER OBLIGATION TO ANSWER
[1:23:07] YOU.
[1:23:09] You know, you sometimes we find that we
[1:23:11] want to put off on the ministry.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I came up for prayer. Nothing
[1:23:16] happened.
[1:23:20] OH, GOT QUIET. HIT A NERVE, didn't we?
[1:23:24] Well, IF BROTHER THOMAS WAS ANY KIND OF
[1:23:26] PASTOR, THEN HIS PRAYERS, LOOK, HE AIN'T
[1:23:28] A PROPHET.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DOES YOUR PROPHET SAY? LET ME
[1:23:34] TELL YOU WHAT YOUR PROPHET SAYS about
[1:23:35] him. See, he says now, well, he must not
[1:23:39] be a man of God or he wouldn't heard,
[1:23:42] you know, we make off like that or God
[1:23:43] would have heard his prayer. He says,
[1:23:45] "What about your faith?"
[1:23:49] SEE, IT'S YOUR faith that touches God.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; WELL, I THOUGHT THE MINISTRY, IT'S YOUR
[1:23:59] faith that touches God.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Notice now, see, you're obeying God's
[1:24:06] WORD. AND WHEN YOU OBEY GOD'S WORD,
[1:24:08] GOD'S UNDER OBLIGATION TO answer you if
[1:24:11] you believe him. It lays in you.
[1:24:16] Well, I thought I thought you have no
[1:24:18] thought coming.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to shift your weakness into
[1:24:22] faith.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM YOUR
[1:24:25] FAILURES AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR
[1:24:26] SHORTCOMINGS AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR ALL
[1:24:28] THESE OTHER THINGS, WELL, YOU DON'T
[1:24:30] MEASURE UP. AND IF I CAN POINT YOU TO
[1:24:31] FAITH THIS MORNING, NOT FAITH IN A
[1:24:33] CHURCH, NOT FAITH IN A MAN, BUT FAITH IN
[1:24:36] A SAVIOR, FAITH IN A GOD LAMB, FAITH IN
[1:24:39] A GOD THAT'S ALREADY DONE IT FOR YOU
[1:24:41] THIS MORNING.
[1:24:44] IF YOU BELIEVE IN HEALING, THEN IT'S THE
[1:24:46] HOLY GHOST IS UNDER OBLIGATION to lead
[1:24:47] you to healing. If you want the Holy
[1:24:49] Ghost, the Holy Ghost IS UNDER
[1:24:50] OBLIGATION TO LEAD YOU TO THE HOLY
[1:24:52] GHOST. IF YOU WANT DELIVERANCE FROM THAT
[1:24:54] OLD DIRTY LIFESTYLE, THE HOLY GHOST IS
[1:24:57] OBLIGATED TO LEAD YOU OUT OF IT.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; SEE, there's a power that's in the
[1:25:05] church, but it's controlled by a law,
[1:25:07] and it's the law of faith. And the Bible
[1:25:09] says, "All things are possible
[1:25:12] to them that believe." If you can
[1:25:16] believe,
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; see, and whatever God will lead your
[1:25:23] soul to believe,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; whatever God I'm going to slow it down
[1:25:28] just for a little bit. Whatever God can
[1:25:31] lead your soul to believe, that's yours.
[1:25:42] WHATEVER, POPPY, WHATEVER GOD CAN LEAD
[1:25:46] YOUR SOUL TO BELIEVE.
[1:25:50] You know, WE WE STRUGGLE. WE, YOU KNOW,
[1:25:51] WE want to ask little things. And I'm
[1:25:53] I'm deviating from my notes for a
[1:25:55] minute. We want to ask little things for
[1:25:56] God because we DON'T WANT TO TAX GOD.
[1:25:59] Ask too much.
[1:26:02] Well, there was a a king OVER THERE IN
[1:26:04] SAUDI Arabia
[1:26:06] and HE WANTED TO LEARN GOLF.
[1:26:10] CARSON, he wanted to be he wanted to
[1:26:12] take some lessons. SO, HE REACHED OUT TO
[1:26:14] THIS PROFESSIONAL GOLFER IN THE STATE OF
[1:26:16] ARIZONA AND HE FLEW HIM OVER TO SAUDI
[1:26:20] ARABIA. TRUE STORY. Go ahead and put
[1:26:23] that out there. Nope. True story.
[1:26:25] Because you know when you see true
[1:26:26] story, you always want to click and
[1:26:27] watch it, don't you?
[1:26:30] SO HE HE CONTACTED HIS PROFESSIONAL
[1:26:32] GOLFER, BROTHER THOMAS, AND HE FLEW HIM
[1:26:35] ALL THE WAY TO SAUDI ARABIA, YOU KNOW,
[1:26:37] HE'S MAN, HE flew him on American
[1:26:38] Emirates or not American Emirates, but a
[1:26:40] United Emirates. Hey, plushy planes.
[1:26:43] He landed there and he was in the
[1:26:45] palace, you know, he's living it up,
[1:26:47] whining and dining. He's got the best
[1:26:50] best uh room and everything. And you
[1:26:52] know, he goes out there and he's
[1:26:53] training this king and he's showing them
[1:26:55] how to putt and he's showing them HOW TO
[1:26:57] DRIVE AND HE'S SHOWING THEM HOW TO HIT
[1:26:59] THE IRONS AND HE'S SPENDING THE WHOLE
[1:27:00] WEEK WITH HIM day in day out, 8, nine,
[1:27:03] 10 hours a day. AND WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER
[1:27:05] AND IT WAS TIME FOR THE GOLFER TO GO
[1:27:07] BACK HOME, THE KING SAYS, "WHAT CAN I DO
[1:27:10] TO REPAY YOU? YOU HAVE BEEN SO GOOD TO
[1:27:12] ME. YOU TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING YOU KNEW."
[1:27:15] HE SAYS, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I COLLECT
[1:27:17] GOLF CLUBS."
[1:27:20] YEAH,
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; HE WAS FASCINATED WITH GOLF CLUBS. AND
[1:27:23] YOU KNOW, AND HE SAYS, "OKAY." SO THE
[1:27:25] KING SAYS, "OKAY." AND HE FLIES THEM
[1:27:27] HOME. HE GETS BACK HOME, BROTHER BRAD.
[1:27:29] AND YOU KNOW, COUPLE WEEKS GO BY AND
[1:27:31] HE'S THINKING, "I WONDER IF THE king
[1:27:33] forgot about me." You know, THEN HE
[1:27:35] PERS, I WONDER WHAT KIND OF GOLF club
[1:27:37] he's going TO GIVE ME. WILL IT HAVE A
[1:27:38] GOLD HEAD ON IT? WILL IT HAVE DIAMONDS
[1:27:40] UP THE SHAFT? MAN, I JUST HE'S A KING.
[1:27:43] Surely he CAN AFFORD SOMETHING SO
[1:27:44] EXTRAVAGANT AS THAT.
[1:27:47] WELL, ABOUT THREE WEEKS GO BY AND ALL OF
[1:27:49] A SUDDEN THERE CAME A CERTIFIED LETTER
[1:27:51] IN THE MAIL. HE'S LIKE, "OH, IT'S FROM
[1:27:54] SAUDI ARABIA." AND HE OPENED UP THE
[1:27:56] LETTER AND IT READ, "YOU ARE NOW THE NEW
[1:27:58] OWNER OF A 500 ACRE GOLF COURSE THAT'S
[1:28:02] ALREADY BEEN PLUSHED AND EVERYTHING BEEN
[1:28:04] MAINTAINED AND COMPLETELY FURNISHED.
[1:28:06] EVERYTHING YOU YOU HAVE NEED OF." HE WAS
[1:28:09] EXPECTING A GOLF CLUB, BUT THE KING GAVE
[1:28:11] HIM A GOLF CLUB. OH, COME ON. DID YOU
[1:28:14] HEAR ME THIS MORNING?
[1:28:17] HOW? WHY? BECAUSE KINGS THINK DIFFERENT.
[1:28:21] IT'S TIME THAT WE START THINKING LIKE A
[1:28:24] KING.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; LIKE WE'RE SONS OF THE KING. WE'RE
[1:28:27] DAUGHTERS OF THE KING. ASK FOR BIG
[1:28:29] THINGS FROM THE KING.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; HE WON THE GOLF CLUB. THAT KING GAVE HIM
[1:28:35] A GOLF CLUB.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; 18 hoes.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; COME ON, JOSH. EVEN YOU CAN SHOUT ABOUT
[1:28:44] THAT.
[1:28:46] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; The deed
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; in the mail.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; See, because it was by faith.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; He knew he would receive. And sometimes
[1:28:58] we know what we'd receive. But maybe
[1:29:00] we're just shortch changing God a little
[1:29:02] bit.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE BY FAITH. WHATEVER GOD CAN
[1:29:06] LEAD YOUR SOUL to believe, that's yours.
[1:29:10] Every place the sole of your foot shall
[1:29:12] SET UPON, BY FAITH, GOD GIVES IT TO YOU.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; If I walked in this place this morning
[1:29:18] with a need, I promise you, I wouldn't
[1:29:21] walk out without it.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I'm speaking to you
[1:29:26] this morning. IF I WALKED IN WITH A NEED
[1:29:28] this morning, I BELIEVE MY GOD IS SO
[1:29:31] GREAT, SO GOOD. YOU THOUGHT 2025 WAS
[1:29:35] SOMETHING? WAIT TILL GOD POURS OUT IN
[1:29:37] 26. AND MAY TAKE SOMEBODY SHOULD SAY
[1:29:40] AMEN TO THAT. BE IT UNTO ME THIS
[1:29:42] MORNING, LORD. I RECEIVE OF THE HAND OF
[1:29:45] GOD THIS MORNING. POUR IT OUT
[1:29:47] ABUNDANTLY, PRESSED DOWN AND
[1:29:48] OVERFLOWING, LORD. I WANT EVERYTHING YOU
[1:29:51] HAVE FOR ME. I WANT MY HUSBAND. I WANT
[1:29:53] MY WIFE. I WANT MY CHILDREN. I WANT MY
[1:29:56] FINANCES. I WANT MY HEALTH. I WANT IT
[1:29:58] ALL IN THIS NEW YEAR.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; See, God gives us faith. The Bible says
[1:30:07] that he's given every man a measure of
[1:30:10] faith.
[1:30:11] So it's your faith in the act that God
[1:30:15] has already did it for you. So God has
[1:30:17] already done this. And as much faith
[1:30:19] will be released, that's how much power
[1:30:22] you can have because in you dwells the
[1:30:25] power to make heavens and earth.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, now let's just slow down for a
[1:30:31] minute. Let's rephrase that.
[1:30:34] There's enough power in you, one
[1:30:36] individual,
[1:30:38] the prophet taught us, to create another
[1:30:42] world and go live on it.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Then why can't why are you struggling?
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Why are you struggling?
[1:30:56] Because of weakness.
[1:30:59] Weakness to believe.
[1:31:01] Weakness because I see failures. believe
[1:31:03] it's because I don't measure up. I
[1:31:06] walked out that door coming out to this
[1:31:07] platform this morning says, "Lord, I'm
[1:31:09] so insufficient
[1:31:11] to speak this word and to preach this
[1:31:14] gospel, but it ain't based on my human
[1:31:17] abilities. And it's not based on your
[1:31:19] human abilities. It's based on what he's
[1:31:22] done for us. The act that God has done
[1:31:25] in our lives. It's faith in that and
[1:31:27] that alone." church.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; We think, well, deities up there
[1:31:33] floating around in the skies and my one
[1:31:36] day we we just get prayed up right and
[1:31:38] we just get ourselves, you know, we
[1:31:40] listen to enough sermons or we read our
[1:31:42] Bible for 89 hours in a day. We're going
[1:31:45] to be right where we need to be. Then we
[1:31:47] can we can approach the throne of heaven
[1:31:49] and we can petition God for what we have
[1:31:51] need of. And we make WE MAKE DEITY UP
[1:31:53] THERE IN HEAVEN. BUT THE PROPHET WOULD
[1:31:55] TELL YOU DEITY IS NOT UP IN HEAVEN.
[1:31:58] Diddy is in you this morning.
[1:32:01] HE SAID YOU THAT'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST
[1:32:04] THIS MORNING, DY LAYS RIGHT THERE IN YOU
[1:32:07] THIS MORNING. NOTICE MEN AND WOMEN, IT'S
[1:32:09] TIME THAT YOU FIND OUT WHERE YOU ARE.
[1:32:11] THE DEVIL'S JUST TRYING TO HIDE YOU
[1:32:13] BACK. TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE SOME LITTLE
[1:32:14] TROTTEN DOWN SOMETHING, BUT YOU'RE NOT.
[1:32:16] YOU'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. DEITY
[1:32:19] IS NOT IN HEAVEN. DEITY IS IN YOU THIS
[1:32:21] MORNING. AND IF DEITY IS IN YOU THIS
[1:32:23] MORNING, THEN GO TO ASKING GOD FOR IT.
[1:32:26] BELIEVING GOD FOR IT. ACCEPT IT. LORD, I
[1:32:29] PERCEIVE IT THIS MORNING.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; When you realize that Almighty God lives
[1:32:37] in you,
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody, just do a little
[1:32:42] quick look.
[1:32:44] You mean Almighty God lives in this?
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; You looked in the mirror this morning,
[1:32:50] some of you getting your hair did, and
[1:32:52] you were struggling with making your
[1:32:54] head up.
[1:32:58] You never even thought God lives in that
[1:33:00] what's in the mirror looking back at me,
[1:33:02] did you? But God lives in that.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, God lives in that.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; That that's looking back at you and all
[1:33:15] its weaknesses,
[1:33:17] God lives in it. Deity is not in heaven.
[1:33:20] Deity is in you. Notice he said, "So
[1:33:23] when a spirit born, spiritfilled man in
[1:33:26] faith TAKES THAT WORD INTO HIS HEART AND
[1:33:29] PLACES IT UPON HIS LIPS." WHY? THAT is
[1:33:32] the same as deity speaking.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; He doesn't finish the quote. Hold up.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; EVERY MOUNTAIN has to go AND SATAN
[1:33:42] CANNOT STAND before that man.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; So you JUST NEED TO REALIZE WHO YOU ARE
[1:33:48] THIS MORNING. Whether you're a young
[1:33:50] person, whether you're an older person,
[1:33:53] maybe you're not completely committed,
[1:33:55] maybe you're just here this morning just
[1:33:57] to see what's going on in the church,
[1:33:59] maybe you're, you know, maybe you're uh,
[1:34:01] you know, you're just working your way
[1:34:02] back in trying to make a decision if you
[1:34:04] want to serve God or not. I'm here to
[1:34:06] tell you, listen to it, why the same as
[1:34:09] deity speaking, when you can take that
[1:34:11] word that God has put on that Bible and
[1:34:13] make it more than just a Bible word and
[1:34:15] now becomes a living word and you speak
[1:34:18] IT THROUGH YOUR LIPS THIS MORNING, IT'S
[1:34:20] THE SAME AS DID ALMIGHTY GOD SPEAKING.
[1:34:23] THEN ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS, I'VE NEVER
[1:34:25] SEEN THE WORD FOUND IN THE MOUTHS OF
[1:34:28] BELIEVING CHRISTIANS. OH, COME ON,
[1:34:30] SOMEBODY. WHAT ABOUT US THIS MORNING?
[1:34:32] YOU GOT A NEED AS A BELIEVING CHRISTIAN.
[1:34:34] YOU CAN TAKE THAT ETERNAL WORD AND PLACE
[1:34:37] IT ON YOUR LIPS AND IT'S THE SAME AS
[1:34:39] ALMIGHTY GOD SPEAKING IT.
[1:34:42] THE SAME ONE THAT SPOKE HEAVENS AND
[1:34:44] EARTH, THE SAME ONE THAT BLEW THE STARS
[1:34:47] OFF OF HIS HAND IS RIGHT HERE THIS
[1:34:49] MORNING WITH THOSE THAT ARE FILLED WITH
[1:34:50] THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; But all we see, Brother Thomas,
[1:34:57] is weakness.
[1:35:01] All we see is our failures.
[1:35:04] See in the church age book,
[1:35:08] brother Bam tells us like this. Don't
[1:35:10] fear, John. John is a type of the bride.
[1:35:14] Don't fear, little flock, that all that
[1:35:17] I am,
[1:35:19] you're an heir to. All my power is
[1:35:22] yours. My omnipotence is yours. As I
[1:35:25] stand in your midst, I've not come to
[1:35:27] bring you fear and failure,
[1:35:32] but love and courage and ability. Then
[1:35:35] he says, "All my power is given or all
[1:35:38] power is given unto me and it's yours to
[1:35:41] you." So you speak the word and I will
[1:35:45] perform it.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Austin, you got a need this
[1:35:48] morning. You speak the word
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; and I will perform it.
[1:35:56] I want to bring it personal. I want you
[1:35:58] to look past your weakness because out
[1:36:00] of your weakness,
[1:36:02] God's going to have a testimony.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; I want to say something else before it
[1:36:07] escapes my mind. The greater the
[1:36:09] weakness,
[1:36:11] the greater the testimony.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; The greater the weakness,
[1:36:18] then the greater the testimony. because
[1:36:21] there's nothing that we declare on our
[1:36:23] own with our own human ability. So, some
[1:36:26] of you may need this next quote because
[1:36:28] I think it we all do. He says, "The
[1:36:29] weakest and the rejected and practically
[1:36:32] every hero of God ever had on the front
[1:36:34] lines was that type of person."
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Let me just let me read it again so it
[1:36:40] it it it charters in your brain this
[1:36:43] morning. the weakest and the rejected.
[1:36:46] And practically every hero of God that
[1:36:49] he ever had on the front lines was that
[1:36:51] type of person. So every hero in the
[1:36:55] Bible was a rejected person
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; or dejected person or one that
[1:37:01] practically had weaknesses all in their
[1:37:03] life. A person that thought to be
[1:37:06] insufficient, a person that had no
[1:37:07] ability AT ALL, THEN THAT PERSON IS JUST
[1:37:11] IN GOOD SHAPE. SO GOD CAN START using
[1:37:14] him.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Oh well, I thought I got to do this and
[1:37:20] I got to do this and I got to do this.
[1:37:22] Oh, to attain to the satisfaction of the
[1:37:24] world. If you're trying to be who's who.
[1:37:26] BUT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE WHO'S WHO. HE
[1:37:28] SAID, BUT WHEN WE'RE THINKING THAT WE'RE
[1:37:30] ABLE TO DO SOMETHING, HE SAID, THEN GOD
[1:37:32] CAN'T USE US BECAUSE WE'RE WANTING TO DO
[1:37:35] IT IN OURSELVES. BUT WHEN YOU COME TO
[1:37:37] THE IDEA AND YOU COME TO THE
[1:37:39] UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO
[1:37:41] OFFER GOD, BUT IT'S GOD USING THAT
[1:37:44] WEAKNESS, GOD USING THAT FAILURE, GOD
[1:37:47] USING THAT VESSEL, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU,
[1:37:50] IT'S ABOUT HIM. IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT
[1:37:52] MAN, IT'S BEEN ABOUT HIM.
[1:37:54] AND WHEN YOU CAN SUBMIT YOURSELF TO HIM
[1:37:57] AND SURRENDER THAT WEAKNESS TO HIM, THEN
[1:38:00] OUT OF THAT WEAKNESS WILL BE STRENGTH.
[1:38:03] WE'LL BE HEALING. WE'LL BE DELIVERANCE.
[1:38:05] WE'LL BE YOUR FAMILY. WE'LL BE
[1:38:07] SALVATION. WE'LL SEE PRODALS COME HOME.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; So we look, I know I'm kind of all over
[1:38:19] the place this morning. I'm feeling
[1:38:21] good.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; When you think of human weaknesses, it
[1:38:25] can depend. We can have spiritual
[1:38:28] weaknesses in our humanity, emotional
[1:38:31] weaknesses in our humanity, moral
[1:38:34] weaknesses in our humanity, and we can
[1:38:36] have physical weaknesses in our
[1:38:39] humanity. And we, you know, how many of
[1:38:41] you are aging?
[1:38:43] Nobody's aging in here but me. Mercy me
[1:38:46] and Brad. Come on, brother Glenn.
[1:38:49] None of us are getting younger. Okay,
[1:38:52] just if y'all didn't know that, ELT, I
[1:38:54] told you.
[1:38:57] BUT OUR BODIES AGE and with that comes
[1:39:01] weakness, comes inflammation, comes
[1:39:04] arthritis, comes back trouble.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Micah, where you at? I know you got back
[1:39:10] trouble. You did last night anyway. And
[1:39:12] we got we we need rest and we need food
[1:39:15] and we need protection and we need
[1:39:17] healing. That's in our physical
[1:39:19] weakness. Then we look at emotional
[1:39:22] weaknesses. And I know I'm not speaking
[1:39:24] to anybody this morning, but we
[1:39:26] experience fear,
[1:39:29] anxiety. We get worked up
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; and our minds run all night long. We lay
[1:39:35] down at 9:30 if you go to bed that early
[1:39:37] and it's 3:00 before you finally shut
[1:39:39] down.
[1:39:40] fear, anxiety,
[1:39:42] loneliness, anger complexes and grief.
[1:39:48] We struggle to stay strong through
[1:39:49] losses and stress and uncertainty.
[1:39:54] You know, we become overwhelmed with
[1:39:55] complexes and feeling insufficient and
[1:39:58] not worthy. We're not measuring up to
[1:40:01] man's idea. You know, Satan will also
[1:40:04] take it and he will make you feel
[1:40:06] unworthy because somebody else has a
[1:40:08] gift that maybe your gifts in line with.
[1:40:10] But some reason you never see what God's
[1:40:12] placed in your life, but you see
[1:40:14] everybody else's. Man, if I could sing
[1:40:17] like that sister that sang today, if I
[1:40:20] could do this, if if if See, that's
[1:40:22] Satan's word to you.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; You shall understand when Satan's
[1:40:26] speaking, he's going to say if because
[1:40:28] he never wants you to see what's laying
[1:40:30] inside of that human vessel. Right.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; But it's a it's a weakness there. And
[1:40:35] you know, it's it's a part of us that
[1:40:37] makes us been able to relation or to to
[1:40:41] have relation with others because we can
[1:40:42] see our need and we can encourage one
[1:40:44] another. Then there's a moral weakness.
[1:40:46] We we face temptation and many of US WE
[1:40:49] BATTLE PRIDE AND SELFISHNESS and
[1:40:51] impulsiveness that can lead us off
[1:40:52] course. And then there's intellectual
[1:40:54] weaknesses. And you know, you got some
[1:40:56] people got great bandwidths of
[1:40:58] intelligence. You got some of us others
[1:41:00] that don't have quite as much
[1:41:01] intelligence as others. But you know,
[1:41:03] thankfully God is not going to, you
[1:41:04] know, allow us to enter into the kingdom
[1:41:07] of God based on how much or how much we
[1:41:09] don't have.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; But it's intelligence. How much we know
[1:41:13] or who we know. And then there's
[1:41:14] spiritual weaknesses.
[1:41:17] See, let me just say it like this. Your
[1:41:19] human weakness spiritually isn't just a
[1:41:22] failure, church.
[1:41:24] It's the place where God's strength can
[1:41:27] come in.
[1:41:32] All right, write that down.
[1:41:34] Human weakness isn't just a failure
[1:41:38] because that's what Satan wants you to
[1:41:39] believe. It's a failure. I'm a failure.
[1:41:43] See, it's the place where God's strength
[1:41:46] becomes visible in your life.
[1:41:54] Failures.
[1:41:56] Joe, you've had some failures in your
[1:41:57] life.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Look where you are now.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed.
[1:42:05] And if you would have let those failures
[1:42:08] keep you where you were, then you
[1:42:10] wouldn't be where you are.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; And if we let our failures keep us back
[1:42:15] there, then we will never measure up to
[1:42:16] where we are today.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; See, we're limited, but God is not
[1:42:21] limited. And we got to depend on God for
[1:42:23] strength, for wisdom, for
[1:42:24] transformation. So it's our it's human
[1:42:27] nature though to hide our weaknesses. I
[1:42:30] don't want nobody to know this about me.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Hide it from others. Hide it from God.
[1:42:36] We don't want to be perceived as weak
[1:42:39] and needy.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Question is answers. 1959.
[1:42:45] And I this is probably one of my
[1:42:47] foremost favorite quotes out of all the
[1:42:50] the sermons that brother Brandham ever
[1:42:51] preached because I recognize I'm a man
[1:42:54] of weakness.
[1:42:56] He says, "Oh, he loved you before there
[1:42:58] was ever a world, Josh.
[1:43:01] HE KNOWED YOUR NATURE, CARSON. HE knowed
[1:43:04] your weakness,
[1:43:06] Austin. He knowed your weaknesses."
[1:43:10] Listen what he says now. HE KNOWS YOUR
[1:43:13] HABITS. HE KNOWED ALL ABOUT YOU, WHAT
[1:43:16] YOU WAS GOING TO BE. AND THEN WHEN HE
[1:43:17] LOOKED OVER ALL THE GREAT UNIVERSE AS IT
[1:43:19] WAS, HE SAYS, "I CHOOSE YOU.
[1:43:27] ME. He chose YOU THIS MORNING. DESPITE
[1:43:32] OF YOUR FAILURES, DESPITE OF YOUR
[1:43:34] WEAKNESSES, DESPITE OF YOUR FAMILY
[1:43:37] FAMILY STRENGTH, GOD CHOSE YOU KNOWING
[1:43:40] IT WAS THERE. KNOWING YOU LACKED
[1:43:42] HUMANLY, BUT GOD SAID, "OUT OF THAT
[1:43:44] WEAKNESS, I'M GOING TO BE STRONG."
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; God chose you in spite of it.
[1:43:53] Oh my. He chose you not because you were
[1:43:56] perfect, brother Tommy, but he chose you
[1:43:58] to be perfect.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; MATTHEW, WE FIND JESUS SPEAKING TO US IN
[1:44:03] MATTHEW 5 verse 48 says, "BE YOU
[1:44:06] THEREFORE PERFECT even as your father
[1:44:08] which is in heaven is perfect."
[1:44:12] Be perfect.
[1:44:14] Wow, that's a that's a lofty task.
[1:44:18] Adriana, have you made it there yet?
[1:44:24] You're like, "Brother Joe, would you
[1:44:25] please quit calling names?
[1:44:28] I'm connecting you this morning. I'm
[1:44:31] bringing you in. It's personal.
[1:44:33] Not personally between me and you,
[1:44:37] but I want to connect you to the word
[1:44:40] for this not just for me. God don't give
[1:44:42] me a thought just for Joe Adams, but he
[1:44:45] gives a thought for the people."
[1:44:47] SO HE SAYS, "BE YE THEREFORE PERFECT
[1:44:51] EVEN AS YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER IN HEAVEN
[1:44:53] or your father which is in heaven is
[1:44:55] perfect." AND HE SAYS, "NOW WHEN IT'S
[1:44:57] NOT MY PERFECTION, IT'S NOT YOUR
[1:44:59] PERFECTION. IT'S HIS PERFECTION OF HIS
[1:45:01] WORD THAT HE CHOSE US. YOU NEVER CHOSE
[1:45:05] HIM. HE BROUGHT YOU INTO CHRIST AND YOU
[1:45:08] ARE SECURED WITH JESUS CHRIST AND YOU'RE
[1:45:10] JUST AS PERFECT AS CHRIST WAS BEFORE
[1:45:12] GOD." DID YOU HEAR THAT THIS MORNING?
[1:45:14] YOU THIS MORNING, LUKE, ARE AS JUST BUT
[1:45:17] PERFECT BEFORE GOD AS JESUS IS STANDING
[1:45:20] BEFORE GOD. THAT'S SOMETHING TO CLAP
[1:45:23] ABOUT. THAT'S SOMETHING TO REJOICE ABOUT
[1:45:25] THIS MORNING. YOU DIDN'T DO IT. HE DID
[1:45:27] IT. THERE'S NO WAY FOR US HUMANLY TO
[1:45:31] BECOME PERFECT. THEREFORE, IF GOD
[1:45:33] REQUIRES PERFECTION, THEN GOD MUST
[1:45:36] PROVIDE PERFECTION.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I SAY HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PERFECT. I'M WEAK. BUT ALMIGHTY
[1:45:45] GOD THROUGH HIS SLAIN SLAIN LAMB, THAT
[1:45:48] ONE THAT BLED AND DIED FOR MY MY BEHALF,
[1:45:50] IT WOULD TAKE MY WEAKNESS AND HE WILL
[1:45:53] BECOME PERFECT.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; PERFECT STRENGTH THROUGH PERFECT
[1:45:56] WEAKNESS.
[1:46:01] I can't be perfect. We can't be perfect
[1:46:04] in ourselves. HE SAID THERE'S NO WAY FOR
[1:46:06] US TO BE, but he declares you to be.
[1:46:12] So in the morning, look in the mirror
[1:46:19] and say, "I demand to see perfection."
[1:46:24] And if that mirror will talk to you,
[1:46:27] it'll laugh in your face.
[1:46:30] Say, "Look at you, boy. 5 foot five and
[1:46:33] a half, baldheaded,
[1:46:36] getting wrinkled.
[1:46:38] You look like a melted ice cream m cone
[1:46:41] upside down
[1:46:44] and you want perfection.
[1:46:47] I want what the word has for me.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; I WANT WHAT THE WORD has for me.
[1:46:59] BE YE THEREFORE PERFECT. Not perfect in
[1:47:03] body,
[1:47:05] but perfect in spirit.
[1:47:08] So we can't be perfect in ourselves.
[1:47:11] There's no way for us to be perfect. But
[1:47:13] he said for us to be. See, so what it
[1:47:16] is, he made a perpetuation for us. The
[1:47:19] Lord Jesus Christ AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:47:21] THAT'S where the perfection comes up.
[1:47:24] IGNORING OUR OWN HOLINESS OF WHICH WE
[1:47:26] have none, our own thoughts which we
[1:47:28] OUGHT NOT TO BE. BUT WE REST SOLEMNLY
[1:47:30] UPON THE FINISHED WORK OF THE LORD
[1:47:32] JESUS. GOD SENT HIM TO THE EARTH AND IT
[1:47:35] WAS IN HIM THAT WE TRUST. WE'RE NOT
[1:47:38] TRUSTING IN OUR CHURCH. WE'RE NOT
[1:47:40] TRUSTING IN OUR PASTOR. WE'RE NOT
[1:47:42] TRUSTING IN THE MINISTRY. AND THOUGH
[1:47:43] THEY'RE GREAT, WE'RE TRUSTING IN WHAT
[1:47:45] GOD HAD DONE FOR US.
[1:47:48] GOD AND GOD ALONE IS A SAVIOR, IS A
[1:47:52] HEALER, IS A DELIVERER, IS A HOLY GHOST
[1:47:54] FILLER. GOD AND GOD ALONE IS THAT.
[1:48:00] TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF A MAN. TAKE YOUR
[1:48:02] EYES OFF OF YOURSELF AND PUT YOUR EYES
[1:48:05] ON THE PROMISE OF GOD.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; God chose you to be perfect.
[1:48:14] When the high priests
[1:48:17] would he would go in once a year,
[1:48:22] he would go in and you would you maybe
[1:48:25] you looked at something
[1:48:27] that you shouldn't have been looking at
[1:48:29] as a young Israelite boy. young
[1:48:32] Israelite girl. Maybe you thought things
[1:48:35] that you shouldn't have been thinking.
[1:48:38] And you know, it's a weakness. I can't
[1:48:40] do this in my own. This thing overtakes
[1:48:43] me. It overcomes me. I want to give it
[1:48:45] up, but I can't. It's a weakness. And
[1:48:48] once a year, you go and you find a lamb,
[1:48:50] brother Thomas, and you take that lamb
[1:48:53] to the high priest.
[1:48:58] That high priest is looking at the lamb.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; He's looking, brother Steve. He's
[1:49:04] looking over the lamb. He's not looking
[1:49:06] at you.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; He's not looking at what you done.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, look. Brother B said, he's not
[1:49:16] looking at how big your nose is, how big
[1:49:18] your EARS ARE. HE'S LOOKING AT THE LAMB.
[1:49:22] HE'S LOOKING AT YOUR SACRIFICE. AND CAN
[1:49:24] I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, THOUGH YOU MAY
[1:49:26] BE FULL OF WEAKNESSES, YOU MAY HAVE
[1:49:29] FAILURES AND FLAWS, YOUR LAMB IS
[1:49:31] PERFECT. YOUR LAMB IS PERFECT. THERE'S
[1:49:34] NO FLAW. THERE'S NO BLEMISH. THERE'S
[1:49:37] NOTHING AGAINST THE LAMB OF GOD. AND IF
[1:49:40] YOUR LAMB IS ACCEPTED, THEN YOU SAY
[1:49:44] HALLELUJAH THIS MORNING. I'M ACCEPTED
[1:49:46] BECAUSE THE LAMB'S ACCEPTED. AND OUT OF
[1:49:49] MY WEAKNESSES,
[1:49:53] I GIVE GOD A LAMB. I GIVE GOD A LAMB. HE
[1:49:56] PROVIDED A LAMB, BROTHER GLENN.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; And he ain't looking at me and my
[1:50:00] failures.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; He's looking to my sacrifice. SEE, CUZ
[1:50:05] THE BLOOD OF BULLS and goats,
[1:50:07] it could not annihilate sin.
[1:50:11] You would go in there, brother Paul,
[1:50:14] and you'd give this land. And if the
[1:50:18] high priest accepted it,
[1:50:22] you' present it and your sins would be
[1:50:23] forgiven.
[1:50:26] But as soon as you walked out and you
[1:50:29] backed out and you left, the same
[1:50:33] desires
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; to sin,
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; you fought them right then.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Same weaknesses,
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; you struggled with it. See, because the
[1:50:43] blood of bulls and goats could not
[1:50:45] annihilate sin.
[1:50:48] Oh, but if that sinner ever puts his
[1:50:52] hands on a perfect sacrifice,
[1:50:55] come on, church. You ever put your hands
[1:50:58] on a perfect sacrifice? YOU EVER PUT
[1:51:00] THEM ON JESUS CHRIST? YOU EVER PUT THEM
[1:51:02] ON THAT PERFECT LAMB? NOT ON SOME
[1:51:04] DENOMINATION, NOT ON WHAT SOME MAN SAID,
[1:51:06] NOT ON WHAT THIS ONE SAID, BUT YOU PUT
[1:51:09] YOUR HANDS ON A TREMBLING LAMB. AND HE
[1:51:11] GOES TO CUT THAT THROAT AND HE BEGINS TO
[1:51:13] BLEED AND BLAME. AND THAT BLOOD GETS ALL
[1:51:16] OVER YOU. I SAID, "HALLELUJAH. LET THE
[1:51:18] BLOOD GET OVER ME THIS MORNING. AND MAY
[1:51:21] MY WEAKNESSES BE COVERED BY THE BLOOD OF
[1:51:24] MY LAMB.
[1:51:27] YOU'LL NEVER GO OUT SINNING ANYMORE.
[1:51:29] YOU'LL NEVER GO OUT LOOKING FOR DRUGS.
[1:51:31] YOU'LL NEVER GO OUT THIRSTING FOR A
[1:51:33] CIGARETTE. YOU'LL NEVER GO LOOKING FOR
[1:51:35] PORNOGRAPHY AGAIN.
[1:51:37] IF YOU CAN GET THAT BLOOD ON YOU THIS
[1:51:39] MORNING
[1:51:42] BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY ONE SACRIFICE.
[1:51:44] THERE'S ONLY ONE LAMB OF GOD.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT BLOOD GETS A HOLD OF YOU,
[1:51:49] BROTHER. THAT BLOOD COMES UPON YOU,
[1:51:51] BROTHER GLENN, IT TAKES EVERY DESIRE OF
[1:51:53] SIN AWAY.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; IT'LL ANNIHILATE SIN. IT'LL ANNIHILATE
[1:51:58] SIN NATURE.
[1:52:04] How can I be perfect by a perfect
[1:52:07] sacrifice?
[1:52:11] By a perfect sacrifice.
[1:52:14] Hebrews 9:22 says, "Without the shedding
[1:52:18] of blood,"
[1:52:20] oh, we don't want a we don't want a
[1:52:22] bloody religion, but without the
[1:52:24] shedding of blood, there is no
[1:52:27] remission.
[1:52:30] Something has to die in your place.
[1:52:34] Someone
[1:52:36] has to die in yourstead.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; And there's only one worthy.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; By one sacrifice,
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; by one sacrifice,
[1:52:46] we don't have to go year after year,
[1:52:48] special meetings to get ATONE FOR
[1:52:50] CHURCH. ONE TIME, YOU REALLY MEAN
[1:52:53] BUSINESS WITH GOD. YOU TRULY REPENT AND
[1:52:55] YOU TAKE ON THAT NAME AND HE'S OBLIGATED
[1:52:58] TO FILL YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST. NO
[1:53:00] LONGER DESIRING SIN, COVERED YOUR
[1:53:02] WEAKNESSES, COVERED YOUR FAILURES,
[1:53:04] COVERED YOUR FLAWS. ONE SACRIFICE, ONE
[1:53:07] TIME. IT AIN'T OVER AND OVER AND OVER
[1:53:09] AND OVER. GOD MADE A TOTAL SACRIFICE.
[1:53:12] GOD MADE A TOTAL COMMITMENT TO THE
[1:53:14] BELIEVER.
[1:53:17] YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP COMING TO THE
[1:53:19] ALTAR AND COMING TO THE ALTAR AND COMING
[1:53:21] TO THE ALTAR. BUT YOU MEAN BUSINESS WITH
[1:53:23] GOD. GOD, I'M GOING TO SURRENDER MY
[1:53:25] WEAKNESS TO THIS ALTAR.
[1:53:28] TAKE IT OUT OF ME THIS MORNING. TAKE THE
[1:53:30] SIN OUT OF ME. TAKE THE DESIRE OUT OF
[1:53:32] ME. TAKE THE DRINKING OUT OF ME. TAKE
[1:53:34] THE WOMANIZING OUT OF ME. TAKE THAT LIFE
[1:53:37] DESIRE OUT OF ME, LORD.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; AND LET ME LIVE a godly life.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, no preacher is going to
[1:53:48] do it for you.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Not even the prophet.
[1:53:54] He was just a man.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; But he's not looking, brother Thomas,
[1:54:00] he's not looking at us.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; He's looking at our sacrifice.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; And if your sacrifice is perfect,
[1:54:10] then you're perfect. Then you he'll
[1:54:13] accept you. See, weaknesses is not just
[1:54:16] a flaw. It's what makes us grow.
[1:54:21] Can I keep going a few more minutes?
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; All right, good deal. I'm glad you said
[1:54:26] amen to that. I was going to disappoint
[1:54:28] you if you didn't.
[1:54:31] See, weaknesses
[1:54:33] creates humility.
[1:54:37] All right, come on, Cherabs.
[1:54:39] Sit on your wings for a few more
[1:54:40] minutes. It teaches dependence not on
[1:54:44] one another but on him.
[1:54:46] It fosters compassion because you see
[1:54:48] weaknesses in your own life. You can
[1:54:50] have compassion for others.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; I know that we some of us struggle with
[1:54:56] that one. I raise my hand.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; I'm like, man, would you just pull up
[1:55:01] your pants and deal with it? Come on.
[1:55:04] Sometimes I lose compassion, Brother
[1:55:06] Troy. I'm like, you've been doing this
[1:55:08] over and over and over and over and
[1:55:09] over, and you just want to slap him for
[1:55:11] Jesus. Say, get a hold of yourself.
[1:55:16] But God reminds you of your own
[1:55:17] weaknesses
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; so you can have compassion for others.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Now, we may struggle, brother Gle, in
[1:55:24] different areas. I don't know what an
[1:55:26] old man struggles with.
[1:55:32] WELL, PRAISE GOD. I AIN'T STRUGGLING
[1:55:34] THERE.
[1:55:37] YEAH. I love it.
[1:55:40] Well, see, when we get the Holy Ghost,
[1:55:41] how many of you got the Holy Ghost this
[1:55:43] morning? All right, that's a good show
[1:55:44] of hands. Well, when I got the Holy
[1:55:46] Ghost, I THOUGHT, "WOO, PRAISE GOD. IT'S
[1:55:48] OVER.
[1:55:50] THIS IS GOING TO BE SMOOTH SAILING.
[1:55:52] WATCH OUT, DEVIL." WAS I WRONG?
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; I GOT THE HOLY GHOST AND THE BATTLE
[1:55:59] INTENSIFIED.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; SO, we think WE GET THE HOLY GHOST AND
[1:56:02] ALL THE WEAKNESSES THAT WE DEALT WITH,
[1:56:04] THEY'RE GOING TO BE OVER. NO, YOUR SOUL
[1:56:06] IS REDEEMED.
[1:56:08] But this little device right here
[1:56:10] struggles.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SO THAT THE FIRST CHURCH AGE
[1:56:14] MESSENGER Paul said, "The things that I
[1:56:16] would do, I do not. And the things that
[1:56:18] I do not, I do."
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; PAUL UNDERSTOOD THE WAR IN HUMANITY. He
[1:56:23] understood the war with weakness.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; So just because you have the Holy Ghost
[1:56:29] doesn't mean it alleviates all the human
[1:56:32] weaknesses.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; No. But the Holy Ghost will give you
[1:56:34] power
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; to control
[1:56:38] to put that weakness under obedience to
[1:56:41] the word of God.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; All right. I hope this is okay this
[1:56:44] morning. See, human weaknesses is a
[1:56:47] result of the fall. So we all when we
[1:56:50] get to the other side, we're going to
[1:56:51] have a conversation with Eve and say,
[1:56:52] "What in the world were you thinking?
[1:56:56] Did you not realize what you did to us?"
[1:57:01] No, she had a weakness.
[1:57:04] See, weakness is a result of the fall.
[1:57:06] It's contribute to sin nature. Before
[1:57:07] that, man lived in an in a a dimension
[1:57:10] of eternity. There was no sin. There was
[1:57:13] no sin nature. We were blameless. We
[1:57:15] were in THE IMAGE OF GOD. BUT AFTER THE
[1:57:17] FALL, man entered into an element of
[1:57:19] time.
[1:57:21] And then their time began to have an
[1:57:23] effect on the body, had an effect on the
[1:57:25] mind, had an effect on our life. And no
[1:57:27] longer did we have a God nature. Now we
[1:57:29] had a sin nature that we were dealing
[1:57:31] with. And so as a result of the fall,
[1:57:34] sickness is a result, complexes are a
[1:57:36] result, anxiety is a result, depression
[1:57:39] is a result, lying and cheating, AND
[1:57:41] THESE ARE ALL RESULTS OF THE FALL. BUT I
[1:57:44] WANT YOU TO KNOW, MAN WAS NOT CREATED TO
[1:57:46] LIVE IN A state of weakness.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; God said, "Let us create man in our
[1:57:53] image." And God was not weak.
[1:57:58] See, God created us to be amateur gods.
[1:58:01] to be perfect in all aspects of
[1:58:03] humanity. He never intended you to rely
[1:58:07] on your humanity and your good deeds and
[1:58:11] your intellect and all all these other
[1:58:14] great things that you can offer God to
[1:58:16] get you back to heaven. No, God knew
[1:58:18] that it would take more than your human
[1:58:20] abilities
[1:58:22] to make a way for you to enter into his
[1:58:24] presence. See, we were all born in sin,
[1:58:26] shaped in iniquity. We come to the world
[1:58:28] speaking lies. Therefore, we needed a
[1:58:31] lamb. And not just a lamb. We needed a
[1:58:34] perfect lamb.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; So I ask you this morning, human
[1:58:39] weaknesses are a result of sin nature
[1:58:42] controlling humanity. So do we make
[1:58:45] excuses
[1:58:47] for who we are?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to hold you much longer,
[1:58:52] y'all. Just revive yourself for a
[1:58:54] minute. Then we MAKE IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW
[1:58:56] the human nature is to make excuses.
[1:58:59] Well,
[1:59:01] I
[1:59:03] family, my dad or my mom or it's a, you
[1:59:07] know, it's a genetic curse. It's a
[1:59:10] hereditary, it's a strain, it's always
[1:59:12] been in my family.
[1:59:15] Shall we continue in sin? Paul would
[1:59:18] tell us that grace may abound.
[1:59:21] God forbid. Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, quit making excuses for your
[1:59:30] shortcomings.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; God has provided you something better.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; He provided you an antidote
[1:59:41] to keep you, to change your desires,
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; change your humanity. You know, we're
[1:59:48] going to deal with weaknesses. But the
[1:59:50] Bible would tell us, Paul says in
[1:59:51] Hebrews 11, "Wherefore, seeing that
[1:59:54] we're we're compassed about with SUCH A
[1:59:56] GREAT CLOUD of witnesses, let us lay
[1:59:59] aside every weight,
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; every incumbrance,
[2:00:04] everything, every sin which so easily
[2:00:06] beset us, and let us run with patience
[2:00:09] the race that is set before us." And we
[2:00:12] MUST FIGHT IF WE MUST REIGN. Things are
[2:00:13] not going to come easy, church. You got
[2:00:16] to be willing to make decisions.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Not pamper,
[2:00:22] not coddle. Oh, my my little excuse and
[2:00:26] my little weakness and I'm not good
[2:00:28] enough and oh, nobody likes me and oh my
[2:00:31] goodness, gag a maggot.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, for real. Codle, codle, codle,
[2:00:36] cuddle, cuddle. Man up, WEAK SAUCE.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; GOD CALLED YOU TO BE A SON AND DAUGHTER
[2:00:42] OF GOD, NOT CODDLE YOUR EXCUSES. NOT
[2:00:44] CUDDLE YOUR FAMILY STRENGTH, NOT CUDDLE
[2:00:46] that weakness, but to lay that thing
[2:00:49] down at the foot of the cross.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Every man that ever amounted anything in
[2:00:55] the Bible was a man that was weak and
[2:00:58] rejected.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; But they were exactly in the place for
[2:01:05] God to use them.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Isn't that beautiful?
[2:01:11] Ain't that just beautiful to realize
[2:01:13] every man, and we say man, we include
[2:01:16] you sisters. Man, as in mankind,
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; every man that ever amounted anything in
[2:01:23] the Bible, was weak
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; and rejected and dejected. and they were
[2:01:30] right in the place for God to use them
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; to be a hero
[2:01:38] of the faith because we're not relying
[2:01:42] on our own abilities.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Look, if we were relying on height,
[2:01:50] y'all look at me. I mean, come on.
[2:01:53] Stubby B.
[2:01:56] WE GOT GIANTS in the room today. Not
[2:01:58] giants, not Anakins. I ain't going
[2:02:00] there.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; We got some very tall individuals. And I
[2:02:04] just wish I had one more inch of their
[2:02:06] height. But if we were going by height,
[2:02:10] man, the Ler family got us all whooped.
[2:02:15] We were going by looks, well, we ain't
[2:02:16] going to go there. We'll just pass that
[2:02:18] one on along.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; So, WE'RE NOT GOING ON ANY HUMAN ABILITY
[2:02:22] BECAUSE IF WE DO, WE LOOK, WE START
[2:02:24] LOOKING AROUND. AND NOTICE, WE'RE NOT
[2:02:26] LOOKING AT WHAT THEY POSSESS. WE LOOK AT
[2:02:28] WHAT we don't possess
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; because that's human nature to see what
[2:02:32] we lack.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Where am I short? Where? And don't y'all
[2:02:36] look at me when I say short.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Where am I weak?
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; See, that's what Satan wants you. Just
[2:02:48] constantly bombard you with your own
[2:02:50] inabilities.
[2:02:52] But if you can ever, ever, ever, if God
[2:02:56] ever takes your eye off of you
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; and takes your eye off your brother and
[2:03:01] takes your eye off your sister and put
[2:03:03] your eyes back on what he's done for
[2:03:05] you,
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; you can see that everybody in the word
[2:03:10] who's ever amounted to anything was just
[2:03:13] like you.
[2:03:17] Just like you.
[2:03:21] But he says, brother Bam tells us, I'm
[2:03:23] going to go just a little bit further. I
[2:03:24] won't hold you much longer. We try to
[2:03:26] make our weaknesses excuses. We want to
[2:03:28] tell how big we are. Let me just I'm
[2:03:31] going to go ahead and be honest, be
[2:03:32] transparent. I drive a big truck.
[2:03:36] Y'all can laugh. Yeah, I'm compensating.
[2:03:40] I'm a little dude, but I drive a big
[2:03:43] truck.
[2:03:45] I had to jump up, Carson, to get in it.
[2:03:46] Thank God it's got electric uh side
[2:03:49] panels or whatever you want to call it.
[2:03:52] Running boards. Yeah, I need them. Run
[2:03:54] and jump on the board. Jump in the seat.
[2:03:58] Cuz look, short people.
[2:04:01] Y'all ain't short. You don't know what
[2:04:02] I'm talking about.
[2:04:04] But we try to make we try to
[2:04:06] overcompensate
[2:04:08] guilty for our excuses. Well, I'm this.
[2:04:11] You find people that they don't talk.
[2:04:15] Maybe they overcompensate because they
[2:04:16] got so much in their brain going on that
[2:04:18] they just don't know how to say it all,
[2:04:19] put it all together. Or we, you know, we
[2:04:22] we just try to they overcompensate, try
[2:04:25] to make their yourself look bigger than
[2:04:26] what they are. And it's a complex.
[2:04:32] Listen what he says now. We want to tell
[2:04:33] how big we are, how great we are. He
[2:04:36] says that's think he said that's what
[2:04:38] God gave me the text for. And he was
[2:04:40] preaching on perfect strength by perfect
[2:04:41] weakness. He says there's little things
[2:04:43] that we do and that we must come to
[2:04:45] church if we, you know, it's to find OUT
[2:04:47] WHAT OUR FAULTS IS AND things of that
[2:04:49] that we might better ourselves. If we
[2:04:51] come to church, church, if we come with
[2:04:54] any objective, then I'm afraid we won't
[2:04:56] get too much out of coming to church.
[2:04:58] See, we must come to find out our
[2:05:00] weaknesses. Amen.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; So if we come to church and we come with
[2:05:06] any other desire than to find out where
[2:05:08] we're weak, where we're short, then he
[2:05:10] says, I'm afraid we won't get much out
[2:05:11] of coming to church. But we must put our
[2:05:13] trust in somebody that's strong.
[2:05:17] And that somebody is not your pastor.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; That somebody's not the ministry. That
[2:05:23] somebody's not your brother and sister.
[2:05:24] That somebody is Christ.
[2:05:29] So he chose us. Brother says he chose us
[2:05:33] because we're in that condition.
[2:05:37] Oh my.
[2:05:39] It is, isn't it?
[2:05:41] He chose you.
[2:05:45] I told you boys I wasn't going to call
[2:05:47] you out, but I got a prime spot right
[2:05:49] here.
[2:05:53] Look at Daniel's trying to not look at
[2:05:55] me. He's like,
[2:06:00] but see, Gideon is not Daniel
[2:06:03] and Daniel is not Paul
[2:06:07] and Paul is not lyric.
[2:06:10] And yet they're all related.
[2:06:13] They share the same blood,
[2:06:16] share a lot of similar spirits, but they
[2:06:18] all have different weaknesses,
[2:06:21] different things that makes lyrics. He
[2:06:23] ticks a little bit different than Paul
[2:06:25] ticks.
[2:06:27] Paul won't talk.
[2:06:31] Daniel's getting there. And Gideon won't
[2:06:34] be quiet.
[2:06:41] Gideon can walk into a crowd and man, he
[2:06:44] don't care. He don't recognize his
[2:06:47] weaknesses because he don't have any.
[2:06:50] Not to himself,
[2:06:52] but we we look and we we see our
[2:06:54] shortcomings and we see our failures and
[2:06:57] we see where we miss it all the time.
[2:07:00] But if we can ever get our attention off
[2:07:03] of ourselves
[2:07:05] and see what God has placed in us, that
[2:07:07] God chose you in that condition.
[2:07:15] Paul, he chose you just like you are.
[2:07:17] Don't change.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe talk a little bit more than
[2:07:20] what you do, but that's okay. And Lyric,
[2:07:23] you too.
[2:07:25] Lyric tries to walk around being all
[2:07:27] bowed up.
[2:07:29] little Tommy Jr. and he's a bowed up
[2:07:31] little fella. We was hitting weights the
[2:07:34] other day. He's surprised that a 50-y
[2:07:37] old man can pump it out like I do. I'm
[2:07:38] like, "Yeah, bro. This ain't no weak
[2:07:40] sauce. I'm Louisiana. I'm cinjun
[2:07:42] strong."
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; But we're all God chose us exactly the
[2:07:49] way we are
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; and exactly
[2:07:52] with the weaknesses that lay in us.
[2:07:57] And out of those weaknesses,
[2:07:59] we become a powerful force to be
[2:08:02] reckoned with.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; When we realize it ain't about me, it
[2:08:07] ain't about you, but it's about him.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; And if I was going to be in Hebrews 11,
[2:08:17] what would be written of me
[2:08:20] in my weakness
[2:08:22] and mine differs in yours?
[2:08:26] and yours differs than your neighbors,
[2:08:30] but from or out of weakness,
[2:08:34] will it be said that I was strong?
[2:08:38] Paul had an infirmity with his eyes and
[2:08:41] he begged God, pleaded with God, take
[2:08:45] this thing from me.
[2:08:50] Caleb asked him, please just get it out
[2:08:52] of me. I just I want to be an apostle. I
[2:08:55] want to be an evangelist. I want to be a
[2:08:57] great preacher. God, DID YOU CALL ME?
[2:08:58] BUT I can't even see the parchment in
[2:09:00] front of me. I'm weak.
[2:09:05] God didn't make an excuse for Paul's
[2:09:07] weakness.
[2:09:10] Paul didn't make up some Saabb story or
[2:09:13] God didn't make up some Saabb story. He
[2:09:15] simply told Paul
[2:09:19] that my strength,
[2:09:22] my strength,
[2:09:24] not your strength, not your church's
[2:09:27] strength, not the prophet's strength,
[2:09:29] but my strength is made perfect in your
[2:09:33] weakness.
[2:09:35] And if you can can surrender to me your
[2:09:38] weakness,
[2:09:39] Paul, I will use you like never before.
[2:09:45] Paul asked for this thing to be removed.
[2:09:47] Many times we asked to be taken out of
[2:09:50] that trial, taken out of that situation,
[2:09:54] to have that weakness covered.
[2:09:58] And if God can speak to you this
[2:09:59] morning,
[2:10:01] my strength is made perfect
[2:10:05] in your weakness.
[2:10:08] And Paul said, "If I glory, I'm going to
[2:10:11] glory in my infirmities.
[2:10:14] For when I am weak, then I am strong."
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Recognize, church,
[2:10:24] when I am weak,
[2:10:29] then I am strong. Not because you can
[2:10:34] bench press 275.
[2:10:37] Not because you can curl 80 pound
[2:10:39] dumbbells a 100 times. It's not that
[2:10:41] kind of strength. Because when you
[2:10:44] recognize your weakness, then you must
[2:10:46] recognize your dependency comes upon
[2:10:48] him.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; And in my weakness,
[2:10:53] I'm strong. Not because of my human
[2:10:55] abilities, but because of him.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Because his grace is sufficient.
[2:11:03] And if God has called you, God chose you
[2:11:06] in your weakness
[2:11:09] to be a part of the body of Christ.
[2:11:13] And we each differ one from the other.
[2:11:18] Romans 12:1, musicians, you can make
[2:11:20] your way back.
[2:11:22] Romans 12 when Paul says this, "I
[2:11:24] beseech you therefore, brothers, by the
[2:11:26] mercies of God, that you present your
[2:11:29] bodies as a living sacrifice,
[2:11:32] holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[2:11:37] reasonable service."
[2:11:41] God doesn't want your excuse. God wants
[2:11:43] your weakness.
[2:11:47] Did you hear me?
[2:11:49] God doesn't want your excuse.
[2:11:54] Gersham, you're about to be married.
[2:11:57] Your responsibility
[2:11:59] taking on a wife and to lead
[2:12:03] and to guide
[2:12:05] and to take her further in the word to
[2:12:08] be a spiritual head. And yet you have
[2:12:10] weaknesses.
[2:12:12] But God don't want your excuse.
[2:12:15] He wants that weakness.
[2:12:19] See, don't make an excuse for who you
[2:12:21] are, how you are. Surrender it to him.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; You surrender that thing to him.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; He told Paul, "My grace is sufficient
[2:12:36] for thee, for my strength is made
[2:12:40] perfect in weakness.
[2:12:43] Therefore, I take pleasure in my
[2:12:46] infirmities."
[2:12:47] It's hard
[2:12:50] to admit that you're weak and you have
[2:12:53] frailties and to own it,
[2:12:56] but it's part of being human.
[2:13:00] But don't make an excuse for it.
[2:13:04] No, you bring it and you surrender it.
[2:13:07] You surrender to him. Surrender to the
[2:13:09] cross. I'll take pleasure in my
[2:13:12] infirmities and reproaches and
[2:13:13] necessities and persecutions and in
[2:13:15] distresses for Christ's sake. For when I
[2:13:17] am weak, then I am strong. Let me bring
[2:13:21] this to a close.
[2:13:24] Think about it for a minute. The maniac
[2:13:26] of Gadra,
[2:13:28] that man had a weakness.
[2:13:30] Sin slipped in. One spirit after another
[2:13:34] spirit after another spirit after
[2:13:36] another spirit.
[2:13:38] And he find him out in the tombs. And he
[2:13:40] was so strong. He can break chain. He
[2:13:42] was five times his strength because he
[2:13:44] surrendered his weaknesses to the devil.
[2:13:49] And brother Bam said, "If a man can be
[2:13:52] five times stronger than what he was
[2:13:54] because he surrendered to the devil,
[2:13:57] what about man when he surrenders to
[2:13:59] God?
[2:14:01] Where would we be this morning instead
[2:14:04] of making excuses for where we come
[2:14:07] from, our family we're in, our
[2:14:10] shortcomings we have? And so God doesn't
[2:14:13] want your excuse. He wants your
[2:14:14] weakness.
[2:14:17] He knows what they are
[2:14:22] and he chose you despite them.
[2:14:25] He doesn't expect you to run from them.
[2:14:28] He wants you to surrender this morning
[2:14:30] with every head bowed
[2:14:33] and every eye closed.
[2:14:36] I'm going to invite you this morning by
[2:14:38] the grace of God.
[2:14:40] You recognize in this new year, you got
[2:14:42] things you're battling that you've not
[2:14:44] got the victory over yet.
[2:14:48] He doesn't expect you to surrender those
[2:14:51] things to the world or to cuddle them
[2:14:54] anymore, but he wants you to make a
[2:14:56] complete surrender this morning.
[2:14:59] Surrender every fear.
[2:15:01] Surrender every complex,
[2:15:04] every unworthy thought, every regret,
[2:15:08] every stronghold, every battle in the
[2:15:11] mind, every physical weakness,
[2:15:13] every financial weakness,
[2:15:16] every doubt,
[2:15:18] every negative thought this morning.
[2:15:20] Every complaint,
[2:15:23] make a complete surrender, church.
[2:15:27] See, God cannot use one ounce of our
[2:15:29] abilities,
[2:15:32] but he can use your surrender. This
[2:15:34] morning, I'm going to invite you to the
[2:15:35] altar.
[2:15:37] Starting a new year, none of us are
[2:15:39] perfect. God bless you. God sees you
[2:15:41] this morning. Whe there be another
[2:15:45] said this new year, I'm recognized and
[2:15:47] I'm coming face to face with reality
[2:15:49] this morning. I'm not perfect.
[2:15:52] I have struggles. I have weaknesses in
[2:15:54] my humanity.
[2:15:56] But I'm going to surrender. I'm going to
[2:15:58] make a complete surrender this morning.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; And out of my weakness,
[2:16:06] out of my difficulties,
[2:16:09] out of my struggles,
[2:16:12] I want God to have a testimony.
[2:16:17] I want God to use me like never before.
[2:16:23] I want to surrender all that I am that
[2:16:25] he can get the glory.
[2:16:28] And he says when you can get to that
[2:16:29] place and you can recognize your
[2:16:32] weakness, then God can use you this
[2:16:35] morning.
[2:16:38] Father, you see every everyone that's
[2:16:41] here, Lord.
[2:16:44] God, you see our struggles, Lord. You
[2:16:46] see where we come short, Father.
[2:16:50] Lord, the battles that we face, one
[2:16:52] different from another, Lord, the the
[2:16:54] mind battles, the struggles, Lord,
[2:16:57] humanity, Father, and generational
[2:16:59] curses and family strains and Lord,
[2:17:02] things that we battle with in the world,
[2:17:04] the pressures of this life, Lord,
[2:17:07] Lord, we come and we lay them at the
[2:17:09] cross this morning.
[2:17:11] We lay them at your feet, Father, not to
[2:17:13] make an excuse, not to hold them over,
[2:17:16] Lord, in 2026, Father, but we surrender
[2:17:19] them to you and make a complete
[2:17:21] surrender this morning, Lord.
[2:17:24] And out of weakness,
[2:17:26] we'll be a stronger Christian,
[2:17:29] be a stronger family,
[2:17:32] be a stronger church, Lord, out of our
[2:17:34] weaknesses, Father. Lord, there's
[2:17:36] there's young men and older men, young
[2:17:39] women and older women. Lord, Lord,
[2:17:42] there's all of us through all walks of
[2:17:43] life. We're here this morning, Lord,
[2:17:45] recognizing
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; our weaknesses, but Lord,
[2:17:50] we recognize your greatness and greater
[2:17:54] the weakness,
[2:17:56] then greater the testimony.
[2:17:58] So, we commit each and everyone to you
[2:18:00] this morning, Lord, the service. Now I
[2:18:03] ask you to bless my brothers and my
[2:18:05] sisters, Lord. Bless the church, Brother
[2:18:08] Thomas, Lord, as he continues to labor,
[2:18:10] Father, planting and planting and
[2:18:12] planting and nurturing, Lord. Brother
[2:18:15] Brad, as he would come behind, Brother
[2:18:17] Thomas, and water and water and water,
[2:18:19] Father, different ones you have placed
[2:18:21] here, Lord, to be an association here,
[2:18:24] Father. the musicians and the you know
[2:18:26] those on the back with the program and
[2:18:28] the sound and the the overhead Lord all
[2:18:31] these other aspects and even us Lord
[2:18:33] sitting right there in the pew.
[2:18:37] Father may you strengthen us today by
[2:18:40] thy word and by thy spirit we pray in
[2:18:43] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:18:56] in the presence
[2:19:02] of Jehovah,
[2:19:08] God Almighty,
[2:19:15] Prince of Peace.
[2:19:21] Trles
[2:19:23] vanish,
[2:19:28] hearts are mened
[2:19:34] in the presence
[2:19:40] of the king.
[2:19:46] In and out of situations
[2:19:52] that tug a war in me.
[2:19:59] All day long I struggle
[2:20:04] for the answers that I need.
[2:20:10] Then I come into his presence.
[2:20:16] And all my questions become clear.
[2:20:23] And for that sacred moment,
[2:20:29] no doubt can interfere
[2:20:36] in the presence
[2:20:42] of Jehovah.
[2:20:48] God Almighty,
[2:20:55] prince of peace,
[2:21:01] trles
[2:21:03] vent,
[2:21:07] and hearts are mened
[2:21:13] in the prison.
[2:21:20] of the king.
[2:21:24] And through his love, the Lord provided
[2:21:31] a place for us to rest.
[2:21:38] A place to find the answers
[2:21:43] in the hour of distress.
[2:21:49] Now there's never any reason
[2:21:55] for you to give up in despair.
[2:22:02] Just slip away and breathe his name.
[2:22:08] He will surely meet you there
[2:22:15] in the presence
[2:22:22] of Jehovah.
[2:22:28] God Almighty,
[2:22:34] the prince of peace.
[2:22:41] Troubles
[2:22:42] vanished
[2:22:47] and hearts are mened
[2:22:53] in the presence.
[2:22:59] Oh, of
[2:23:01] the king. In the presence of Jehovah.
[2:23:05] Oh, in the presence
[2:23:13] of Jehovah,
[2:23:19] God Almighty,
[2:23:25] prince of peace,
[2:23:31] trles vended,
[2:23:37] And hearts
[2:23:39] are mened
[2:23:44] in the presence
[2:23:50] of the king.
[2:23:55] And it is no secret
[2:24:03] what God can do.
[2:24:10] What he's done for others,
[2:24:16] he'll do for you.
[2:24:22] And with arms wide open,
[2:24:29] he'll parten you.
[2:24:36] It is no secret
[2:24:42] what God can do.
[2:24:48] Oh, it is
[2:24:51] no secret
[2:24:55] what God can do.
[2:25:01] What he's done for others,
[2:25:08] he'll do for you.
[2:25:12] before you with arms wide open.
[2:25:20] He'll pardon you.
[2:25:26] It is no secret
[2:25:33] what God can do.
[2:25:39] Flow through me,
[2:25:43] Holy
[2:25:44] Spirit.
[2:25:46] Flow through me.
[2:25:53] Flow through me.
[2:25:56] Holy Spirit
[2:26:00] flow through me
[2:26:06] as I lift my hands to worship
[2:26:13] and to magnify
[2:26:17] thy name. Flow through me.
[2:26:23] Holy Spirit
[2:26:26] flow through me.
[2:26:31] Oh flow through me.
[2:26:36] Holy
[2:26:37] Spirit
[2:26:39] flow through me.
[2:26:45] Flow through me.
[2:26:49] Holy Spirit
[2:26:52] flow through me
[2:26:58] as I lift my hands in worship
[2:27:04] and to magnify
[2:27:09] thy name. Flow through me.
[2:27:14] Holy Spirit
[2:27:17] flow through me. Let's sing it one more
[2:27:21] time. Oh yes. Flow through me.
[2:27:27] Holy Spirit
[2:27:30] flow through me.
[2:27:36] Overflow through me.
[2:27:40] Holy Spirit
[2:27:43] flow through me
[2:27:49] as I lift my hands in worship
[2:27:56] and to magnify
[2:28:00] thy name. Flow through me,
[2:28:05] Holy Spirit.
[2:28:09] Lord through me.
[2:28:13] Amen. Can we sing He's in the house.
[2:28:16] He's in the house this morning.
[2:28:19] A little girl was lying there. The
[2:28:23] people all were weeping.
[2:28:28] They just laughed at Jesus said, "She's
[2:28:32] only sleeping."
[2:28:36] But as he took her by the hand,
[2:28:40] she began to live again.
[2:28:44] Some began to praise the Lord.
[2:28:48] And some began to say,
[2:28:52] "He's in the house,
[2:28:56] and death has to flee down this
[2:28:59] morning." Oh, now there is life
[2:29:04] where darkness used to be.
[2:29:08] And now there is hope
[2:29:12] and there's no more doubt.
[2:29:16] Praise his name.
[2:29:20] Praise his name.
[2:29:24] He's in the house.
[2:29:30] I was like that little girl
[2:29:34] dead in all my sin
[2:29:38] till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[2:29:42] and gave me life again.
[2:29:46] I am just a house of clay.
[2:29:51] Ever since that blessed day,
[2:29:55] there's a light that shines on me for
[2:29:58] all the world to see.
[2:30:02] He's in the house
[2:30:06] and death has to flee.
[2:30:10] And now there is life
[2:30:14] where darkness used to be.
[2:30:18] And now there is hope
[2:30:22] and there's no more doubt.
[2:30:26] Praise his name.
[2:30:30] Praise his name
[2:30:34] for he's in the house.
[2:30:37] Oh, and death has to flee.
[2:30:42] Now there is life
[2:30:45] where darkness used to be.
[2:30:49] And now there is hope
[2:30:53] and there's no more doubt.
[2:30:57] Well, praise his name.
[2:31:02] Praise his name
[2:31:05] for he's in the house
[2:31:09] and he's the name above
[2:31:14] all names
[2:31:17] and he is worthy of our praise.
[2:31:25] Oh, and my heart will sing,
[2:31:29] how great
[2:31:32] is our God.
[2:31:38] Oh, for he's the name above
[2:31:44] all names.
[2:31:47] Oh, he is worthy of
[2:31:51] our praise.
[2:31:54] And my heart will sing.
[2:31:58] How great
[2:32:01] is our God.
[2:32:07] Oh yes. How great
[2:32:12] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great
[2:32:19] is our God? And all will see how great,
[2:32:26] how great
[2:32:29] is our God.
[2:32:33] How great,
[2:32:35] oh yes, how great
[2:32:40] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great
[2:32:47] is our God and all will see how
[2:32:55] how great.
[2:32:59] Let's bow our heads this morning.
[2:33:03] precious, kind, heavenly father, as
[2:33:06] we've once again experienced,
[2:33:09] Lord, your presence with us again today,
[2:33:12] Lord, in a special way. Father, we know
[2:33:15] that's you, Lord. We see you, Father, in
[2:33:18] your servant when the word comes forth,
[2:33:20] Lord Jesus. We see you in the praise of
[2:33:23] your people, Lord. We see Lord Jesus you
[2:33:28] in the response of the people Lord when
[2:33:30] they give their hearts and their
[2:33:31] weaknesses to you and come to the altar
[2:33:33] Lord and give you their weaknesses and
[2:33:36] we know that's not in vain. We know that
[2:33:39] you see that and you honor that Lord and
[2:33:42] Father I'm expecting to hear
[2:33:43] testimonies. I'm expecting Lord Jesus to
[2:33:45] you for you to take all those who have
[2:33:48] Lord surrendered their weaknesses today
[2:33:51] Father and message that you've laid upon
[2:33:54] brother Joe's heart that's minister to
[2:33:56] us. We know that it wasn't his message.
[2:33:58] It was your message to us this morning.
[2:34:01] And Father, we ask God that you'd help
[2:34:03] us, Lord, to be able to surrender all of
[2:34:05] our weaknesses, Lord, so that you can
[2:34:07] turn them into strength, mighty
[2:34:10] strength, Lord Jesus, and do great
[2:34:12] things, Father, even as you did with the
[2:34:14] Apostle Paul, Lord. Father, we thank
[2:34:17] you, Lord, that we can tar, Lord, for
[2:34:19] those, Lord, who are seeking to touch
[2:34:21] the hem of your garment, Lord Jesus.
[2:34:23] just needing a touch from you this
[2:34:25] morning, Lord Jesus. As ministers can't
[2:34:27] do it, but we can show them the way and
[2:34:30] show them, point them in the direction,
[2:34:31] and that is to you. And Father, and
[2:34:34] we're so grateful, Lord Jesus, this
[2:34:35] morning for having been around one
[2:34:38] another, Lord Jesus, your children,
[2:34:40] Lord, and your presence in their house
[2:34:41] of God. We thank you, Lord, for what
[2:34:44] you've spoken to us today. And we would
