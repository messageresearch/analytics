amen brother troy if you want to are you going to come and read the scriptures for us the children can be dismissed for sunday school if we'll just open up in the psalms we're going to read in psalms 119. and we're going to go to verse 49. psalms 119 verse 49 we're going to start we're going to read to 64. remember the word unto thy servant upon which thou hast caused me to hope [Music] the proud have had me greatly in derision yet have i not declined from that law horror had taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law i have remembered thy name o lord in the night and have kept thy law thou art my portion o lord i have said that i would keep thy words i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies the bands of the wicked have robbed me but i have not forgot in thy law i am a companion of all them that fear thee and of them that keep thy precepts the earth o lord is full of thy mercy teach me thy statutes god bless you may be seated brother brian morning brothers and sisters you know every time you go through the psalms david says i thought on my way and then i turned my direction while i'm paraphrasing there uh if you return with me to ezekiel the 33rd chapter you know i was thinking this morning let me just read the first ten verses and it goes along with what brother thomas and brother brad and ministers have been preaching you know everyone's accountable you whether they think so or not we're all accountable again the word of the lord came onto me saying son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land and if the people of the land take a man of their coast and set them for their watchmen if you look at this scripture here uh when god is speaking to ezekiel he its first person here his people as the prophet for his day those are the people his people that he was supposed to speak to in the day that he was living he goes on to say when that when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blows the trumpet to warn the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and take not warning if the sword come take him away and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head so in anything we do in life no matter what it is if if you see someone doing something wrong you have an obligation to tell them that they're doing something wrong and then if they choose not to heed you you know whether it's in business whether it's on the job hey stop doing that that's stupid you're going to hurt yourself if they choose not to listen to you then that's on them that's not on you and he goes on to say his own head if you hear the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul and you know in the day that we live in right now there's been a lot of preaching there's been a lot of teaching and everyone is responsible right now the trump had sounded for the whole world that we live in now they have to choose to hear the message uh in the where we're at and he goes on he heard the sound of the trumpet took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchmen see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not worn if the sword come and take away any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood i will require of the watchman's hand and now we've had a message for the hour that we're living so you can't say that you haven't been warned it goes from the youngest to the oldest you know everyone's accountable for the measure of truth that they've heard or received in their life and everyone will be accountable on that day for that and i was a i was just gonna read this is a quote out of the uh devotional this morning but uh this is what brother branham has to say it's on it's tomorrow it's tuesday it's august 31st and it and it goes on they we see in the scriptures that when a city was built and of course we're not living in this day where they had walled cities or towers that everyone would run into when the people come to steal their crops or or to attack but he goes we see in the scriptures when a city was built first thing was built was the protection of that city which was the wall then to be sure that the city was safeguarded they had a tower built way high on the wall and a watchman was in the tower day and night well it's a little bit different how you have the five-fold ministry that's your watchman that's what your soul is accountable today in the hour that we live in and he goes on 24 hours he around he washed east north west and south because he's higher than the rest of the people he can see off his duty is to warn the people when he could excuse me when he could see uncommon judgment army's approaching spies slipping by anything coming on no matter what it was he reported it back to the city and he was a good watchman you know sometimes you can when we hear the what god is speaking to us sometimes we don't always hear it like we need to hear it and take heed to it in the day that we're living and he goes i want to say something here i hope you catch it in the right way do you mean to tell me that they would put a nearsighted watchman in the tower when this life of the city depended on it but you know i was thinking you know uh i've been i don't mean in a bad way but the last couple of weeks i've been i don't listen to the news anymore i try not to because i just get angry i i don't mean angry in a bad way i just get a little bit angry that the situations that i've said a couple of weeks ago it's like we're living in the 1970s again and i know for some of you that aren't old enough that doesn't mean anything because you didn't live in the 1970s but what we see going on in the natural out there in our country to me we're just going right back to where we were 40 years ago but in the church sense the church is doing the same thing they're not going forward in god anymore and they're continually doing the same bad things over and over and over again and they're not coming to maturity in the age that we live in and he goes on to say i hope you catch it in the right way do you mean to tell me that they would put a near side of watchmen in the tower excuse me when the life of the city depended on him but they put a man in there that was half blind certainly not he would put the best side of man that they could find out to put to put in there and it goes what and he as he explains and it goes to the five-fold menace god sets men in the age that you live to keep you on the straight no basically but you we're all individuals we have a choice whether we'll heed that message and obey it and it's it's a it's a relationship there between you and your savior between and you've got to have that holy spirit you've got to have that holy ghost abiding in your heart and life for you to hear the message and know it's the truth and then to walk in it and he goes on to say what do he i don't want to i have a tendency to re-read certainly not he would put the best side of me man that could find they put in excuse me that they put in there god also when he builds his city his church it's walled with the blood of his own son jesus christ and he put a tower on it now god has said in the church first apostles secondary prophets and teachers pastors and so forth god set him in the church god put him there excuse me they're qualified for the job god wouldn't put a man in the tower in a position like that that said the days of miracles has passed you know we're well put way past this now the days of miracles pass you people do things that you can't even find in the scriptures and think they're okay you know this is we're talking when this was preached we're talking 50 60 years ago people have gone totally off the deep end they're all the way on the other side now because god would put a man in position like that to be a prophet or a seer that would say jesus christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever when the bible declares him to be you know people don't even you know even in brother branham's day they didn't believe jesus was divine but in our day it's even worse than that they just think he's another man and his teachings are no better than another man's teaching god would put not put a man in a tower there he would preach that would preach a wishy-washy gospel and not tell the truth and warn the people of the wrath that is to come he put a man in there that would be bold that would have the spirit and then seeing the uncommon coming judgment regardless of what the people said he'd warned them anyhow cry out against it he doesn't put blind prophets in his tower he let the prophets and preachers that foresee the coming judgment and warned the people and i was going to jump over here i hope i have the right right spot here in my thompson chain reference bible you know that i say it a lot i don't mean to but like i said the only hope you have is in christ if you're looking for anything else you're going to be miserable on that day um let's uh i'll just read a couple of these scriptures here that it's page 1448. and this is just some of the uh let me go to this this one right here and he sent forth his servants to call them that were bidding to the wedding and they would not come and you know god if you go through the gospels he's he's bringing that message to the people of his day he's and these some of the scriptures that deal it uh romans uh no i don't feel like reading that this morning i'm trying to find the right spot i'll i'll jump up here uh i isaiah 55 and the first row ho everyone that thirst has come you to the waters and he said there's no money coming in by me hey come by wine and then he says and then matthew 22 show you therefore into the highways as many as you shall find and bid them to the marriage and then john i'll just leave i'm losing my perspective here but the one thing i would say this morning you know i said i've been angry the last couple of weeks and he but i shouldn't be angry i'll i'll be honest with you yesterday i was out on a job i don't know why i'm saying this i was out on a job yesterday this family living in this house they got all kinds of children and i spent four or five hours trying to get their air conditioner i mean it's working don't get me wrong but i don't know how many times i've tried something different just to make a piece of junk work so they have air conditioning through a hot weekend my point being is that you they need to start from new everything they need a new unit well we need a new heart and a new life you just can't keep doing the same thing time and time again and getting a bad result and not expect to have a bad result at the end so everything we do has to be new you know you have to have that experience with jesus christ this morning that you're the new man that everything that you do in life is through him brother david love him with all your heart this morning yeah stanley's in that little course oh yes so yes i'm a child this morning amen oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king flows through my veins [Music] [Music] oh i'm a child [Music] [Music] compassion the king of all kings in pity and great love he

one thing that frustrates me is someone that's just an idiot and that's just about what they all are and i thought lord it doesn't matter because we know the end of the story we know what's going to happen we know it's supposed to happen but the blessing that god has given us to be born in such a beautiful country and to have the freedom that we have this morning it does rile our inner man that that man's got to die because this morning we're going to see the king you believe that with all your heart and i thought you know all this going on and the sickness going on and you know cover's real

[Applause] praise god [Music] praise god praise god praise god amen good to be in the house of the lord this morning um definitely been a hot week and like brother butler said we're probably all tired and drained and i think someone's got headaches and probably from the heat and stress and different things so uh certainly thankful to have a a place to come in out of the heat and fellowship around the word of god um just a a couple of quick announcements on my part for this weekend i it was delegated to me and we've got some good delegators in the church and and it was delegated to me to uh to uh kind of oversee the precautions that we will take for the upcoming meetings and i did infection control uh for a couple for several years at at the nursing home and you know when you're trained to see it it's tough and people you have to explain it to people but i was trained to always see the negative and that's kind of a tough place to be in sometimes but i was trained my eye catches if i see something on the floor it's a fall hazard and if i see somebody touch their nose and touch a doorknob it's an infection hazard and you know it's just a constant thing so some of the precautions we'll take and uh why don't you have your seats for just a second if you would no no no need in standing but a couple of the precautions we're going to take and i think brother butler made mention you you know sometimes we're doing things a little different the small bags of chips so individualized the small bottle of water is individualized the drinks will be poured from somebody and we're going to take all precautions we can uh so that we're not touching a lot from an affection control perspective touching and and you know you you transmit that way we did a drill uh in nursing school and when i was a uh infection control officer but we put this uh liquid on a person's hands and then we would tell them to go wash their hands and do it like you're supposed to do the abc song you know wash your hands and scrub them in your fingernails back of the hands and then come back and i could put a black light on it and it will show what was still left there you would be amazed at what was still left on the hand and so everywhere you touch you transfer and we all know this it's just it's just the way germs and stuff work so we're going to take the precautions that we can wash your hands i know it was mentioned to me to say something about uh you know try not to encourage people to shake hands you know it's that's tough it's tough in church because you want to greet people and you want to shake hands but you know uh really if you know some if you throw out your hand to somebody it's instinct to shake it and some people may be offended by that at this point where we're at so uh just be cautious of those things um you know and respect each other space i guess it will be the next thing but outside of that we're trusting god for great meetings um you know no virus is going to uh stop the power of god um he knows all things and he knew it before the beginning so it's all in control uh you know there's no chaos involved around it it's all under control and uh just pray for those that has it it is real uh you know i just seen a video yesterday a friend of mine who was a coach of mine when i was in high school and i tell you what he was about as athletic and and we thought he walked on water as far as playing baseball you know he was great and just a real athlete and he's 52 now i think but he's got cove with terrible badge taking transfusions chris shortens who it is you may know remember him he's a pastor of a church up around glasgow but you know he's uh he can't hardly breathe he can't hardly get around and we're talking about a picture of health so it's affected his blood pressure it's affected his blood sugar so it's real and it's something that we have to be uh mindful of but like i said outside that looking forward to great meetings and i won't keep on about that so if you would stand with me we'll turn this morning into the book of ephesians i'll take a little thought the familiar thought ephesians 6 10 ephesians 6 and 10 i'm going to look at the clock brother butler because when we start change sunday schools i can't tell what time i start when i stop so i don't want to just keep going if if if we're done we're done so ephesians 6 and 10 paul here i'm just thankful for paul you know i was thinking about paul earlier in the week and saw paul and and uh you know he made a conversion for christ and you know paul's known multiple times in the bible was the apostle to the gentiles so without paul making a conversion where would we be i think god had it all in control but it makes you think about you know brother balor was speaking about gifts and callings and and doing for christ what if paul hadn't done for christ or saul i should say and and took the conversion so something really to think about there and but we're thankful for paul and he says here finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand through thick and thin through your ups and downs and your goods your bads and your mountains and your valleys after you've done all to stand what's to say stand therefore stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth in heaven on the breast breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto all with all pers perseverance and supplication for all the saints let's just pray heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us for the opportunity to come out and fellowship around your word and we see you see the believers you see the the ones who's come out this morning to have you speak to their hearts lord and we trust lord that they came with that purpose in mind lord that whatever they have need in their life lord that you would just meet that need this morning and and lord i raise my hand and say i'm a needy person this morning lord and i need more of you and i i need you to speak to my heart this morning to draw me closer to you and help me to recognize uh the battle that we're in this morning lord we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you and we just asked your blessings upon the reading of the word in jesus name amen you can be seated also if you want to turn to second corinthians 10 paul's speaking here and he says now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence and base among you but being absent and bold towards you but i beseech you that i may not that i may not be bold when i'm present with the confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god and the pulling down of strongholds so as i was looking at this and i was thinking if i speak to you this morning if we were to title it i would title it the unseen warfare uh you know in my whole life i i think and i've always been kind of intrigued with the unseen world i've always uh been intrigued with what goes on around our lives and and in our jobs and our homes and our families and it's actually stuff that's that's not visibly seen with our eyes but uh and yet it controls most of the actions or the reactions in our life the unseen world the unseen that you can't see the universe i always wonder what's just beyond that last star there's something else out there what's beyond the depths of the ocean what other life is down there there's something down there so the example i would give you this morning for the unseen world and how it affects us is covered 19. somebody show me kobe 18. show me kobe 19. i want to see cobia 19 placed upon this pulpit you can't see it it's there not saying it's here but in reality it's there its own surfaces its own places we see the out the outcomes of it we see the symptoms the signs we see what happens with the unseen it's always there but a step beyond microbiology if we were to say would be in the spiritual realm and when we look into the spiritual realm and and even though we can't see it brothers and sisters there's a heated battle taking place this morning there is a heated battle taking place this morning and in this heated battle it's deciding what is controlling you what is controlling me that's what's happening in this battle that we can't see we can't see this battle that's taking place but it's there listen to this brother branham says grant lord that something will be said tonight or done that will cause the wayward to turn to christ for we believe we feel pressed in the spirit that great judgments are upon these lands in the last days plagues diseased germs already bred up yeah 1950 diseased germs it's already bred up to be scattered throughout the nations the next statement says no doctor even know how to take hold of it in that astonishing quote 1950 there's germs being bred up that he's saying are prepared to be scattered across the nation and doctors can't take a hold of it let me tell you we're living in a day with technology and knowledge and wisdom and we've got some of the best trained doctors that the world has ever seen and they don't know what to do with them wear a mask get a vaccine don't get a vaccine the vaccine works the vaccine don't work you can still get sick you might kill somebody might spread it they don't know what to say and i'm not getting political here but i'm just telling you what he said and and he says when nations are breeding germs together to burst them in bombs and millions will die in hours over it yeah he said but i'm so thankful and here's where we can be thankful i'm so thankful he says that when the destroying angel went forth you said touch not nine that have to seal the father upon their foreheads do you see how important it is to know where you stand in this unseen world where do you stand this morning in the unseen world he said where the where the sacrificial lamb has been has been killed and we take this body under the blood god we're waiting for the midnight hour to come and we march out and it's called in these nights of the promised land and we're girded and shot with the gospel of peace with the full armor the whole armor of the gospel going forward and see the world is in fear the world is it does not know what to do right now they're relying upon cnn and fox news well i'm sorry that's not going to cut it but he says here we are we're prepared and we're known at the great chief captain the one that met joshua after crossing the river he said he knows where he's leading you god is good he says so here we are listen to this and we know tonight the morning star is over us the banners are gleaming the colors are streaming and we're bound to win don't you like that this morning we're bound to win we're bound to win he says if we trust in him who will not fail us he says listen now grant it tonight listen he says many things may be done send your spirit give people faith he says sometimes it startles why does it hurt alone because they can't see it and all of a sudden this faith is put upon them and the prophet's praying that this faith would come down and it comes down upon him he says sometimes sorrows and they realize the presence of the great thing wow i want to live in such a place that i'm able through jehovah through god almighty that i can recognize that the holy spirit is here and the holy spirit is leading and guiding and taking care of us because brothers and sisters i want to tell you we are in a battleground we were in a battleground this morning and the problem said we didn't come for a picnic we didn't come for a picnic we got on the battleground we're fighting the enemy this morning do you think about that we're fighting an enemy that comes straight about the pits of hell and it's been unleashed upon this he said we're not here to eat cookies you didn't get up this morning your feet hit the floor so i'm gonna go to church for a for dinner for a cookie for a meal now you come here this morning to see what god needed out of you and what you could do that god could use you in a greater way and that you could realize who you are this morning you if you come here to look pretty if you put your armor on this morning to come and see who would adore you and admire you and and see who you are and how great it you could be through ambition you're at the wrong place because there is a war that's raging this morning soldiers are giving their weapons in battle for a purpose they're giving their their their weapons and their shields and for a purpose it's not to look pretty oh they may have parades they may have this or that but when they go into the battlefield and the fire is raging they've got a weapon that is there ready to be used it's a fully functioning weapon and brothers and sisters sometimes we as christians we're looked down upon we're made fun of but on the inside we come as warriors on the inside we come as warriors we're because we've been sprinkled in the blood and that old rugged cross that's gone before us it's led the way and it showed the way that we could be warriors and soldiers and on our road to victory this morning so i don't care what the devil says the devil's going to come to you as parents and they're going to come to you and he's going to say your children can't be saved he's going to tell you that your children are lost he's going to tell you you can't have peace he's going to tell you as a young person that you can't have joy that you can't have happiness that's what the devil is going to tell you but god says the field belongs to us that the field belongs to us the devil's going to say you can't have your healing you can't get over that headache sister that's what the devil's going to tell you you can't get over these things you can't have your healing you can't have your security you can't have financial peace you can't have all these things the goodness that god has given us but god says footsteps means possession and when the children of israel were marching into the promised land they told said keep marching keep marching why keep marching because every time they moved up an inch they gave a little bit of more land every time brother says that's what we got to do is keep marching into victory nobody ever said there's going to be anything easy about it let me tell you there's people sitting here this morning sitting here this morning that have been through the battles there's people sitting here this morning they've been through the battles of life and they have the scars to prove it if we could see the unseen through our eyes and look into the hearts of some of the people sitting in this building tonight you would see scars of heartache scars of pain scars of agony scars of defeat scars of depression scars of fear they've been through it there's some of us sitting here this morning that are in the midst of the battle right now maybe i don't see it maybe the pastor don't see it you know people's good at disguising people's real good at disguising what's going on in their life and hiding what's going on but there's people sitting here no doubt today that's going through things in the battle of life right now that satan is throwing dark after dark left aft right dart after dot coming after you and you begin to feel the weight of the world and the depression and you begin to feel all this weight and you just wonder i just don't know if i can take it anymore keep marching keep marching this morning because there is victory on the other side of the battleground and you say well i haven't gone through it i'm not in it it's coming you see there's three kinds of christians those that's been through the fire those that's in the fire and those it's approaching the fire you might as well learn from us that's been through it and going through it you might as well watch and say teach me elders show me what it's all about how you handle yourself when you go through the fire he said well you're all gloom and doom this morning no no i'm reality this morning i'm telling each and every one of us that sometime in your life you're going to have to stand toe to toe with satan you're going to come to a place in your life when you're going to look him eyeball to eyeball and you're going to have to make a decision are you going to run are you going to cow down or are you going to stand and fight and take the victory you see satan is always studying he don't have nothing else to do in life you know what his number one priority is you you he's not worried about brother brother byler he's worried about you he's not worried about aaron he's worried about sister becky you see what i mean he's individualized and he's got all of his sights on you and i i thought about this some time ago years ago and i thought you know he's got a crosshair on each and ever through one set of eyes you're in his crosshair this morning if you're a christian and you proclaim jesus christ as your savior then you are in satan's crosshairs it's like a game of chess now i'm not i don't know much about chess i don't know nothing about chess but what little i do know is when it comes down to it when the king on either side of the board can move no more once that king is trapped the winning side declares checkmate and the game's over is that right you chest people is that right once the king can't move no more and he's stuck and it's over he's done checkmate you lose well there's a painting that's hung in the louvre in the museum in paris and it's known as checkmate and in this painting it depicts two chess players and on one side of the chess board is satan and satan is sitting there and he appears arrogant and he's confident and he knows that he's got the game in his hand and he's sitting there you can look at i looked it up on the internet looked at the picture there and i thought wow what a depiction of this game of chess because on the other side of the board here is a person that's frantic and they're frightened and and they're frustrated because they feel defeated and they know if satan wins this game of chess he wins their soul you ever feel like you're in a game of life a game of life when you don't know what where you're going to end up where the battle is going to stop what the next move is but here in this painting that's hanging on the wall and this is supposed to be a factual legend here there was a grand master chess player that happened to be walking through the move looking at the museum artifacts the the paintings the mona lisa and so and he comes up and he begins to look at this chess board and he sees satan and all of his arrogance you know he's pretty arrogant satan's pretty confident he don't ever go into a battle thinking he's going to lose and so he he goes in this grand chest master looks up at this pain and begins to look and say studying it and he can't take his eyes off of it and he studies it and he studies and as he's looking at it he notices something surprising and he calls the curator of the museum museum and says come here come here do you have a chess board he said well i probably got one in the office well can you go get it so he goes and gets it he brings out and sets up this chess board and this chess grand master begins to look at the painting and he puts piece by piece and he's looking and he's matching up the sides and looking at the opponents and he's matching all these pieces up and then he begins out jubilation he begins to shout and say look at this the depiction is wrong satan's not winning he just thinks he's winning this guy who is beat and defeated and looks like he's he has one more move that beat satan out of the board brothers and sisters what a depiction how that we can let things get such an image in our mind that we can't even see what's before and here this young player wasn't his pitcher it wasn't checkmate it wasn't check me he had the ability to feed satan and that's the way it is in our lives sometimes we feel down we feel defeated we feel depressed we feel like we're in a corner with no move left you ever been there and you feel like you can't move any direction and we consider this world a mess if you ask anybody right now this world's a mess it's in war it's in violence we have a pandemic we have unemployment it causes struggling marriages causing kids not to go to school causing kids to be socially distancing from all their friends and all they know is a young person i can't imagine growing up with nobody around but our kids are growing up that way you got unemployment depression isolation you know we're not made to be isolated we're not made to be tucked away and isolated we're made to fellowship but here you see this this isolation and inflation and it goes on and on and on and it's easy for us to become this illusion in our minds that we can't see the picture and we begin to feel lost and then we begin to look for direction and sometimes we end up in the wrong place but if we would just realize that it looks like checkmate but fear not the game's not over because the king of king has another move this is not new to god it may it may scare us it might give us fear anxiety not knowing what tomorrow but this is not new to god he's not called aware of the situation in your life denominational groups are beginning to look and they're beginning to see what we've been saying for years that it's rotten to the core i was i was just amazed at some of the comments that i seen on facebook of some some denominational groups and they had been out to i guess go to shop or whatever and they were just astonished at the pollution the vulgarity in nashville tennessee and i think where you been i seen that when i was 16 years old but something has something has happened and i told joyce we were talking one day and i said you know what it's just amazing at how deceitful and how sly satan is you know back in 1906 april the 9th there was azusa street meetings the azusa street revival meetings began to sweep across the nation well it wasn't long after that in 1909 a prophet of god was born so something had to happen to combat this movement of god that's sweeping across the land are you with me because anytime there's a battle between good and evil it's going to come down to modern day it's going to come right down there in our front door and this movement happened over time over and over and over and we begin to look at god here and i think about this azusa street revival and if we were to go back and look i told joe as i said if we were to go back and look at pictures and video of the life of people in 1906 what would you see and i didn't timeline at all but i thought this is how sly the devil is i would i would venture to say that in 1906 if a woman was in a bathing suit she would be put in prison i would venture to say that because it was so out of the ordinary it was not something that was accepted she would have been considered insane they would have put her in an insane asylum but what happened slowly year by year by year a little more a little less i should say a little less alcohol became big you had the prohibition coming on we got god moving in the spirit and we got people moving in the spirit if you know what i mean and it becomes it began to become standard and what is standard today would have had you thrown in prison in 1906 i tell you i was about as nervous as i've been in a while to preach this message because i knew i was exposing satan today i knew that i was going to tell everybody in this building what satan is how he operates how he moves his motives his intentions i hope you're listening because brothers and sisters the spiritual warfare has been going on from the very beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the angels and what happens lucifer he begins to get jealous and lucifer comes down there and he begins to talk to the other angels the very angels that god created and he convinces brothers and sisters one-third of the angels to fall down with him and and go against god through jealousy and we act like satan's no big deal let me tell you if he can convince one-third of god's angels what can he talk you into so lucifer was thrown out of heaven and it looks like god's been defeated now god says i tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to make create a man in my own image i'm going to create a man in my own likeness satan says that's a good move god that's a good move so what does satan do surely eve surely you won't die surely you won't die what's he doing he's taking the next move into his hand and he adam and eve to fall the garden of eden allow him control now of the earth looks like god's down again doesn't it god says i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to get me a way of redemption and god goes out there and he takes this little lamb and he slays the lamb and he throws those bloody lambskins at adam and eve and the prophet said he told him to put him on and he said he could see those lambskins bloody hitting against their thighs but what was it was redemption so that god so they could have a way back into the garden to talk to god that's how good god is satan didn't quit satan says come here cain you've been watching this deal with abel how could god favor him so much more than you how can god favor abel so much more than you how do you stand that i guess nobody's ever had a jealous spirit before [Applause] come on [Applause] we're human my wings hadn't sprouted yet how can you stand able look at you kane you work so hard you make such a beautiful presentation you sweat you labor you work so hard and still it's not good enough for god i tell you what do cane why don't you slip on out in the field when nobody's around in the secret of your own domain and get rid of him just get rid of him just get rid of the problem god's severed do you realize that so what does god do i won't be defeated so god then brings up seth and you know we often seth is so overlooked in the bible very rarely preached on very rarely talked about but do you realize that god brought self up so that man could then be calling on the lord again and there was the lineage of god coming right back and brothers and sisters this goes on and on back and forth over and over all through the old testament that nimrod and abraham and pharaoh and moses on and on and on and the apostle paul looks back at this and he understands that we as christians we as christians are engaged in that spiritual war just like our natural soldiers are engaged in a natural war it's the same kind of battle different front and he understands that we're fighting a real enemy yeah and this is where we get a little bit hairy at times because nobody wants to talk about the devil nobody wants to talk about him you know it's it's great when we come to church and we hear about the word we hear the word of god we hear about the overcoming power of god we hear the greatness of god we hear the salvation of god we hear the healing of god but we forget the other side of the story and this battle is raging back and forth and satan is committed he's committed to the cause and that made me think about this taliban people brother brian tell me if i'm wrong are they committed to their calls they are committed to their calls they'll die for their cause they'll do whatever it takes to get to the point of their cause and that's the way satan is there was a poll taken there was a poll taken and they were asking people about the reality of satan in their life sixty percent sixty percent of americans believe that the devil or satan is not an actual living thing but simply a symbol that was in 1966. where are people at today let me tell you we better realize and make no mistake about it because the devil is real demons are real i've come face to face with it only one time and i don't ask for it again i told the story years ago i think it scared adriana and austin i quit telling it because my kids were old enough to understand but it's real plug your kids ears if you don't want them to hear it but when i was young i began to battle back and forth i was battling whether or not if i was going to preach and god was calling me to come and preach and god was calling me to do this and i i was fighting with all i had within me and i'd done this for a while and time went on and time went on and finally i'd made a commitment i'll say god i'm gonna do it i'll do whatever you want me to do and we were in the in our old house i never told this story because it happened originated upstairs where the kids slept i didn't want him sleeping with me so i never told him but i was laying there one night and i woke up laying flat on my back joist was asleep and i hear footsteps just as plain as day walking in the loft above our bedroom and you know the sounds of your house you know what kind of noise the creaks and noises your house makes this was not anything that i'd ever heard somebody was in my house and right about the time when i thought i'm fixing to get up and see what's going on i was paralyzed literally i could not move i tried to pry myself up off the bed i tried to put my feet up on the floor and nothing would happen but i could hear slowly these steps coming down the stairs and you think well you were just dreaming i wasn't dreaming i'm telling you i wasn't dreaming and slowly out of the side of my face i was pinned it felt pinned to the bed and slowly out of the side of my eyes the corner of my eyes i see this dark shadow and it comes slowly through the room around the side of the bed come down to the foot of the bed and as i'm looking up over the foot of my bed i see this just black dark shadow image and i'm i'm wanting to cry i want to scream i want to run i want to do everything i can possibly do but i'm stuck and as it comes up over the top the foot of the bed and begins to look down upon me and it's like it was a piercing darkness looking down upon me i couldn't breathe i thought i'm going to die and it's as real today to me as it was the day it happened and i can remember that feeling of pain and pressure and fear and i look at the shadow over top of me and the only thing that comes to my mind is jesus and i say it with all it's in me jesus and just like that it was gone but it made a believer out of me i knew that there's a realm on the other side there is a reality of what's happening on the other side you know somebody once said that the devil's cleverest trick is to make people believe that it doesn't exist think about that if you don't think he if you don't take him serious what have you got to fear not a thing another guy said the devil may be out of out of fashion for some but he's not out of business they don't want to think about satan they don't want to see him they don't want to know him but yet he's still working billy sunday you know brother brown talked a lot about billy sunday the evangelist and he said i know that the devil is real for two reasons number one because the bible says so and number two because i've done business with him most of this morning this morning wouldn't want to admit that we like billy sunday we've done business with the devil but i can guarantee you some everybody in this building at some point in time you've done a deal and a business deal with the devil oh come on now some of you looking at me cross-eyed like a cow looking at a new gate it's the truth you've done some kind of deal with the devil you've done something you shouldn't do you've looked at something you shouldn't look at you've listened to stuff you shouldn't listen to you've worn or done stuff that you shouldn't wear that's dealing with the devil that is the beginning of the devil's business so i always want us to remember today that as a church we're engaged in the spiritual warfare and we need to study him we need to know his moves we need to know how he carries out his plans we need to know his motives his intentions and never forget that i heard a story about muhammad ali and muhammad ali was scheduled to fight george foreman two amazing boxers champion versus upcoming george foreman had never been knocked out and only done the knocking out and he was trying to come up work his way up if i'm not mistaken to take on the muhammad ali and so muhammad ali steps into the ring and he steps into the ring after he's made all these months of preparation to fight george foreman and george foreman was known as a man that comes in with power and authority and he's going to knock you out as quick as he can so muhammad ali finds himself in the ring and he backs up against the ropes and stands in defense george foreman wore him out for the first round the second round the third the fourth the fifth the sixth and people are one he's not even going to fight him he's scared to even take his hands down he's not going to do anything to defend himself he's just sitting there got his hands up and taking this beating from george foreman i can't believe this the next round he comes out and muhammad ali i will tell you he floats like a butterfly stings like a bee he unleashed on george foreman and he let george foreman have all that he could handle and knocked him out cold and they asked him after the fight what was you doing he said i studied i knew he come out hitting hard i knew he'd come out with authority and i also knew that he never went past the fifth round and he said so i knew if i could just let him hit me and i defended myself and let him hit me over and over and over eventually he was going to get wore out and he said when i seen he couldn't hardly stand no more and he'd wore himself out and he was out of breath because he couldn't swing no more he said i'll let him have it brother sisters that's knowing your enemy that's being aware of the tactics you know a lot of people a lot of people around church is this okay a lot of people around church they think their enemies are their brothers and sisters in christ you disagree with them on something and you disagree here you disagree there and all of a sudden they're your enemies you know you have a little conflict and you can't say i'm sorry or i was wrong i worked with a girl well she's older than i am she always tells everybody i'm a brother she never wanted i don't know what that means i don't know what's good or bad but i worked with her and i'm going to tell you what she'd do anything for anybody she would try to she would try to do whatever it took to give them days off and she may be watching today and if she is she knows i'm telling this with love and she would do anything possible but you don't show up to work or you quit without a notice you know what her saying is what is it they're dead to me yeah because she would pour out everything that she had trying to help these people and all of a sudden they don't come into work they don't they just don't show up and then they call back two three weeks later it was funny they called back can i get my job back i say you need to talk to her she wants her job back no she's dead to me she doesn't exist what is that that's a spirit they're dead to me and that's the way sometimes we get and she did it in fun would be honest she really went on the extra mile i want to clarify her name clear it up there she would go the extra mile i may have to encourage her a little bit but she would try but we mistakenly think that our brothers and sisters are our enemies but what does it say in verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil have you ever looked up what wiles is we know in our mind what it what it's insinuating but it means devious cunning strategies employed in manipulating or persuading someone to do what one wants for we wrestle not against flesh and blood it's not your brother it's not your sister it's not your neighbor that didn't let you borrow the shovel it's not the guy that cuts you off on the on the highway and and told you is number one it's not that guy it's the spirit behind that guy it's the spirit because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities what are these principalities principalities in the bible and there's different levels of demons that's what our principalities are and if you look in the bible you see principalities and powers go hand in hand so these these principalities these demons the presence of demonic activity these things are real and what their goal is is to kill injure worry destroy vex harass irritate confuse frustrate and bother humans now let me ask you how many of you had to deal with the devil yeah he's got your number he's got your card you're on the fight card with the devil whether you know it or not and we got to bring these things to realization because he does these things because he's mad and wants to get back at god and who are you but god's children how much more how much happy does it make him to get back at god's children for god kicking him out of heaven so he's out to get you why do we need to know this you say i've heard these things my whole life we got young christians here they need to hear these things they need to know that when they become christians they become under attack let me tell you a young person you can float along through life all you want and you fly under the radar satan as long as you are not serving christ you're just under the radar you're kind of in no man's land you're floating through time but it's important that you know that once you give your heart to christ once you give your heart to christ flying under the radar doesn't exist anymore from that point on you're now an enemy of the state you're an enemy of satan you're an enemy of his domain because you're here on earth so he's coming for you principalities are first mentioned and it talks about it in different versions of the bible and different ones it talks about principalities rulers authorities forces and authorities rulers of power and they it's always tied to evil and maliciousness that's not what you thought she's gonna get this morning is it evil and maliciousness the first mention of roman 8 romans 8 is the first mention it says who should separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution famine neckiness peril or sword for as written for thy sake we are killed all day long and we're accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors him that loved us listen to the next statement for i am persuaded he says i got to tell you this i'm persuaded let me let you know this isn't either death nor life nor angels principalities powers nor the things nor the present or the things to come no height nor depth or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus my lord brothers and sisters if i didn't verses of victory i've never read them if that's not verses of victory that tells us that christ has won over all the forces that rage against us and that we have been told today that we're more than conquerors against these forces of evil and nothing life death angels demons nothing can take that away from us god is good so the goal of these principalities and powers are to do as much damage to humans as god will allow they're part of a a rank in the kingdom of darkness that include all these fallen angels that's been kicked out of heaven with lucifer and their intent is to hinder the purpose of god on earth and take as many people as possible to hell you know where the devil wants to do with you he wants to take you to hell that's his that's his life's ambition he wants to see you fall he wants to see you turn your back on god he wants to say you become a from a light of god to a child of hell and that's his intention that's his goal and you know he's accomplished a lot of that he's accomplished a lot of that the problem has been over time that these spirits the stand for these things have been glamorized i know this is in the living room here we're preaching in the living room here but they're glamorized through media books songs facebook [Music] video games hey my kids have to but sometimes i wonder and i say that with sincere heart i really wonder about the things that we bring in upon ourselves because there's always a hidden message the unseen there's a hidden message a hidden agenda a hidden thought something that's being implanted into the brains and in the minds of god's people because i bet if we were to look and we were to take a poll i bet if we were to ask how many of these companies that make these movies these books these video games how many of them are christian based companies how many you think that's what i was thinking so do they have the best interest of our minds do they have the best interest of your children's mind [Music] unseen but there these principalities we have to be careful not only what we see what we hear the things we we look at feed upon but we got to be careful of the places we go these principalities they're not regulated to just individuals they cover territories they cover territories they cover lands they cover cities there there are cities that carry spirits of murder i think it was in 50s i'm not sure whenever the mobsters was in chicago i didn't read the day but i read the story but in chicago they had to go to the burger king and as they used their mobile freezers because the murder rate was so high they didn't have a place to put the bodies and what is chicago still known for today murder these these these principalities they cover regions they hover over places some places are perverted some places are filled with homosexuality lesbianism some places are filled party party till you can't party no more you go to louisiana mardi gras never been don't want to go don't ever care to see it they say it's the stinkiness place on the face of the earth i had some friends that went there and they said the smell was unbearable pollution party till you can't party no more brother brown listen to this brother branham said that same spirit of god that said these things and said oh city capernaum who called yourself by the name of the angels los angeles how you've exalted yourself into heaven and are the very root and seat of satan he says preachers it's a graveyard for him good men go there and die like rats he said what a havoc and we let me ask you are we careful of where we go or do we just get in the car start it and drive something i've been working on and this is kind of off subject but really not something i've been kind of working on is i heard a preacher and i can't remember if it was brother tim pruitt or who it was but he's he said that somebody had told him never get angry when you get caught in traffic or something slows you down or something hinders you because what you can't see may be the accident that was you was prepared to be in what you can't see is the truck that was fixing to run across the road what you can't see is the death that was upon your life but your guardian angel put a horse and buggy in front of you and i've been working on that because boy did that used to bother me bad i was good i guess i i guess i moved from black road where it was calm and peaceful well most of the time to a drag strip some of you know what i'm talking about i was coming down the road right here stringtown road the other day coming down the road just minding my business about 40 miles an hour that's plenty fast enough on that road i was in a dually dooley pickup truck and all of a sudden in my mirror i see this torpedo coming i think what in the world they're going to run over me no they weren't running over going around me i bet they went around me 70 mile an hour brothers yeah wide open and then the next day i found out somebody to run over our smack mirrors with with chris and chars bro charles brother right cut him up why because people are they're they're neurotics they're under a spirit they're under an influence but thank god he allowed me just to keep my cool and i said have a great day hope you make it to your destination see we have protection as christians we have protection what is that our protection is one another through christ we pray for one another we hurt for one another we we we we feel for one another jesus is one of the greatest things that you could ever do in your life is to be able to put yourself in somebody else's hurt when you can accomplish that you're moving because until you can you can't understand you can't understand but when we hurt for people when we see people sometimes we have to just look and say is that person in anguish maybe i should pray for them because we just don't know you just don't know what somebody's going through you hear mary magdalene's name mentioned throughout the bible in jesus's time she was a a follower of him one of his one of his disciples that followed him married magdalene but who was she before she touched jesus jesus performed an exorcism in her yeah he performed an exorcism in her he come to her and cast out seven demons out of her unseen to the rest of the world but jesus knew because that battle was going on brother sister we need jesus for full deliverance this morning we need jesus to be in our lives like he was those people back in that day the legion we've told the story many times jesus goes to legion who've cast out thousands of demons nobody else saw unseen they just thought he was insane they didn't know what it meant and here he is eat up with these over and over for years and years and years he's eat up with these demons one more one or two more and then we're going to close for we struggle not against flesh and blood blood but against rulers against authorities powers of the dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil and heavenly realms i don't know if any of you has ever read any of charles stanley's stuff but he writes some pretty good stuff from time to time and he says when the enemy strikes we must be very clear on one point brothers and sisters in christ are not our enemies we need to recognize that the devil attempts to blind us deceive us so that we become divided and begin to war against one another rather than against him the real enemy is the devil and his forces acting behind the scene in every case of spiritual assault if two people come to brother byler and they're at odds with one another and they say i can't stand this guy i can't stand him he lied he this he that he done this he done that i i i just want to kill him satan has caused that division you know it's a funny thing human nature we're easily rubbed the wrong way one minute we we love everybody one minute everybody's our best friend one minute everything's good and everything's going going fine and just one little thing rubs us wrong and the whole atmosphere changes we got to remember brothers and sisters we got to remember it's not my brother it's not my sister it's the devil causing the divide there's strength in numbers how many times have we said that there's strength in numbers and we're only as strong as our weakest link so we have to be able to to fight satan off in these places and allow him not to get in and influence us to do those things but the realization is the truth is we got to be willing to forgive one another i said we're funny people by nature why is it so hard to say that i'm sorry brother man i was wrong will you forgive me you want to talk about a peace you can hold that grudge all you want i've seen it i've seen people do it you brother baller's seen people do it hold grudges for years and years and years and their thought is they're dead to me when all they have to do is take the humble side and say i'm sorry will you forgive me the devil has tried to kill us he tries to steal our friendship he's tried to steal our joy he's trying to split our homes he's tried to get between husband and wife he tries to get between children and mother and children and father he tries to get between congregation and pastor come on people i'm telling y'all his tricks i don't know today he's trying to destroy the church of christ he's trying to destroy god's people but jesus brings unity harmony peace joy love compassion we're coming into a weekend coming up when we need unity we need love we need compassion we need god the spirit of god to come down and move upon our people in a mighty way that they will never be the same from that day forward so he's a havoc maker yeah yeah he's a havoc maker he wants to try to get between what you believe yep i had a young man call me some time ago it's probably been maybe i don't know a few years say and he calls me asked me how i'm doing you know how it all starts how you doing brother i'm doing good how are you you know have you ever thought about this what brother branham said here as soon as he asked that what's he what's where's he going what's he trying to do here where is he going have you ever thought about this or that and what was he doing he was trying to place doubt in my mind he was trying to divide me from what the very things i believed in the most and he was trying to build that divide there to get me to step away from what i believed i let him ramble on for a while and he was telling me about this new movement he'd seen and this over here and this over there and how great this was how great this preacher was and this and that and the other and i just let him ramble on until he was finished and i said you know what that's what i told him i said you show me something better you show me something better than this show me something better than the message of the hour something that'll make you live as godly of a life something that'll make your women dress like ladies something that'll make you sing gospel songs instead of honky tonk songs show me something that'll make you uh go places that you should go and stay out of the places you shouldn't be show me something better that's about the end of that conversation because he knew i had him right there and that war was going on in between my mind and his mind and there was a no doubt satan and good and evil was battling it out trying to figure out can we do it can we get him can we get him can we get him show me something better you're gonna have to better than that today's in the world kids are in the world it's sad it's sad you know what the d in devil stands for lord showed this to me this morning i like this drama drama ain't nothing i i i hate more than drama somebody that's always stirring something but what we got to remember we got to be careful now because it's not them there's a motive there's a spirit there's an intention behind it to keep the waters muddy to dismantle to disassemble to destroy the fame framework of the church and to to reduce the gifts and the callings and the movement of christ i'll tell you what i'm i've been pretty happy with the movement we've been having here i think the preaching of the word has been really good brother bob has been bringing out gifts and talking about gifts we had people singing that usually didn't sing we've had people singing more that wasn't singing so what does satan want to do turn it down i'm gonna have to find a place to get off here i gotta gotta get off this ship i found this and i thought it was pretty good you know we got the beatitudes and this was the devil's beatitudes yeah blessed are those that are too tired too busy too distracted to spend an hour a week with their fellow christians they're my best workers blessed are those christians who wait to be asked and expect to be thanked i can use them this is satan talking now this is satan's beatitudes blessed are the touchy who stop going to church for they're my missionaries blessed are the troublemakers for they shall be called my children other complainers for their complaints are music to my ears blessed are those who keep a list of preachers mistakes for they get nothing out of his sermons i thought somebody spent some time writing these blessed is a church member who expects to be invited to his own church for he is part of the problem instead of the solution you know it it's really sad when you have to call people and ask them when are you going to come back to church i probably shouldn't say this brother butler but it's come to me more than once i got to say it sometimes on wednesday nights i could throw a handful of gravel out across this pews and not hit anybody that's all i'm going to say blessed are those who gossip for they shall call strife and divisions that please me blessed are those who are easily offended for they will soon get angry and quit blessed are those who do not give an offering to carry stealing from god you steal from me for me not from me blessed is he who professes to love god but hates his brother and sister for he shall be with me forever last one blessed are you who when you hear this think the preacher is talking about someone other than you for i've got you right where i want you let's stand give the lord credit this morning god's good you say how do we do this how do we overcome how do we fight this battle how do we continue to walk day in and day out with this battle raging there's only one way you can do it it's because of the blood that was shed on calvary and that blood that was shed on calvary he didn't have to do it you heard me talking about billy sunday and what he said earlier you know brother brandon said billy sunday said in one of his messages that on the day of the crucifixion when christ was up on the cross and was nailed to the cross he said there was an angel sitting on every limb waiting to come at his back and call to take away he didn't have to do it but he loved you and i enough that he kept those hands nailed to the cross because all he had to do was jerk that hand off he said and point a finger and they all would have came to him what a mighty god we serve let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus we're thankful lord you've ministered to our hearts this morning lord and spoken words of wisdom and and knowledge of who we're at and who we're battling in this war that's raging amongst us and so many times we fail to realize that the unseen things are what's controlling us in our lives it's controlling our neighbors it's controlling our brothers and sisters and the things we say and and do and the actions that we that we profess and the things we do father so lord may all of our actions be coming from you father may we find ourselves dedicated and and committed lord to to the word of god and to prayer and to dedication and commitment to you so that we don't fall for those wiles of the devil so that when satan comes and knocking on our door we're able to recognize who he is we're able to recognize the cunningness and the deception and the slowness that he brings forward lord jesus we ask for your help this morning but we also know that through you we can make it because the word says that we're more than conquerors we've been made more than conquerors through jesus christ and lord without you we fall in those traps without the holy ghost leading and guiding we find ourselves looking at things we shouldn't saying things we shouldn't treating people in ways that we shouldn't treat them but lord god thank you for that blood that was shed just as you made a way for adam and eve in that garden through those bloody lambskins that was cast on them lord a way back that they could come and fellowship with you through all of our mistakes through all of our failures there was a lamb of god that was shed on calvary's tree the blood that run down that tree of calvary lord and said today you're victorious today you're a conqueror today satan checkmate [Music] checkmate [Music] just thank you lord this thing of course we've been made more than conquered i think that's what you were playing we've been made more than conquerors [Music] overcomers in this life we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ [Music] oh we've been made more than [Music] conquerors in this life [Music] we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ [Music] brother and sister for some reason this year these meetings have just been so heavy on my heart and i know brother we've talked about it and they've been heavy on his heart we just didn't want to go another year and he he's just sharing that with me earlier he didn't want to go another year without it but i know we're living in a late hour and will you make a promise today that you will pray every day till the meetings if if it's just a few seconds just remember lord touch touch these services lord move in these meetings lord touch the hearts of our young people would you make that commitment this morning let's just let's just sing that song again we'll turn it to brother david we've been made more than conquerors [Music] once again to them this morning we've been made more than cockers [Music] overcomers in this life we've been made victorious [Music] through the blood of jesus christ
