[57:53] this morning but yet we want to try to
[57:55] express
[57:56] what the holy spirit's laid on our heart
[57:57] to speak this morning is that okay
[58:00] amen i trust that you've been praying
[58:01] for me because you know all of our song
[58:04] services and everything that we do all
[58:06] of our praying
[58:07] it comes down to this right here and
[58:09] that is
[58:11] for the servant of the lord to be
[58:12] yielded to god that he can actually
[58:14] speak to your heart amen
[58:17] and this is the part where the battle
[58:19] begins this is the battle part
[58:21] of it all and so we trust that
[58:24] we'll just be able to help and be in
[58:27] edify the body of christ
[58:29] amen so we'll just power heads
[58:32] lord jesus we come before you father
[58:34] this morning once again lord
[58:36] realizing lord jesus that this is our
[58:38] day this is
[58:40] our time father which we only have a
[58:42] short time here
[58:43] but lord we want to make the most of it
[58:45] father so this morning as we have
[58:47] assembled ourselves together in the name
[58:49] of jesus christ
[58:50] we ask god that you would keep your word
[58:53] father where you said wherever two or
[58:55] three would gather
[58:56] in your name there you would be in our
[58:59] midst lord jesus
[59:00] and father it is wonderful to see one
[59:02] another but to know
[59:04] that you are in army it's the most
[59:06] glorious thought
[59:07] and the most glorious thing that we can
[59:08] have is to have you
[59:10] right here lord jesus and father we do
[59:13] pray god that you're the same yesterday
[59:15] today and forever as the song that we
[59:17] sang lord that you would do like you did
[59:20] with those disciples on the road to
[59:21] emails father
[59:22] that you would speak to our hearts along
[59:25] the way lord may you speak to every
[59:26] heart this morning lord as we
[59:28] both yield ourselves to speak and father
[59:30] as those in the audience
[59:32] yield themselves to hear what you have
[59:34] to say
[59:35] father now speak we ask it in jesus name
[59:39] amen and amen turn your bibles if you
[59:42] will
[59:42] and we'll i think i'll just read about
[59:44] two or three scriptures
[59:46] amen so that we don't have to go back to
[59:48] it all the time and we'll just try to
[59:49] lay a foundation
[59:51] amen in matthew the third chapter
[59:54] matthew 3.
[1:00:12] uh
[1:00:16] okay donna you may uh make sure double
[1:00:19] sure
[1:00:20] with your headphones or whatever make
[1:00:22] sure that we are actually online
[1:00:25] amen because i know one time we for some
[1:00:28] reason when i came up
[1:00:29] began we had no sound stephen and right
[1:00:31] just no sound so we'll make sure that
[1:00:34] and amen so all right chapter 3 of
[1:00:36] matthew
[1:00:38] in those days came john the baptist
[1:00:40] preaching in the wilderness of judea
[1:00:43] and saying repent ye for the kingdom of
[1:00:46] heaven
[1:00:47] is at hand and then turn over to
[1:00:54] matthew
[1:01:01] 4
[1:01:07] verse 17.
[1:01:11] actually let's go back to uh
[1:01:15] verse 15. the land of zebulon the land
[1:01:18] of
[1:01:18] nephthylum by the way of the sea beyond
[1:01:21] jordan
[1:01:22] galilee of the gentiles the people which
[1:01:25] sat in darkness saw great light and to
[1:01:27] them which sat in the regions of the
[1:01:29] shadow of death
[1:01:31] light is sprung up and from that time
[1:01:34] jesus began to preach and to say
[1:01:36] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at
[1:01:39] hand
[1:01:40] mark 16.
[1:01:58] afterwards verse 14 verse 14 16 14
[1:02:01] afterwards he appeared unto the eleven
[1:02:03] as they sat at meat and operated them
[1:02:06] with their unbelief and hardness of
[1:02:07] heart
[1:02:08] because they believed not them which had
[1:02:10] seen him after he was risen
[1:02:12] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[1:02:15] world
[1:02:16] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:02:18] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:02:20] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:02:22] be damned
[1:02:24] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:02:26] believe in my name they shall they cast
[1:02:28] out devils
[1:02:29] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:02:30] shall take up serpents
[1:02:32] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[1:02:34] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[1:02:36] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:02:38] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[1:02:40] them he was received up into heaven and
[1:02:42] sat at the right hand of god
[1:02:44] and they went forth and preached
[1:02:46] everywhere the lord working with them
[1:02:48] and confirming the word with signs
[1:02:50] following amen over in luke 24
[1:02:58] now notice in that last scripture that
[1:03:00] we read it said preach the gospel
[1:03:03] to every creature he that believeth and
[1:03:05] is baptized
[1:03:06] shall be saved he that believeth not
[1:03:08] shall be damned but if you'll notice
[1:03:10] here that there's one thing that's left
[1:03:12] out there
[1:03:13] and that it didn't talk about repentance
[1:03:16] it didn't speak anything about
[1:03:17] repentance
[1:03:18] amen but yet we know that preaching the
[1:03:21] gospel and preaching the kingdom
[1:03:23] has to do with repentance isn't that
[1:03:25] right and that's what we're going to
[1:03:27] speak on this the help of the lord
[1:03:28] is repentance repentance just a simple
[1:03:31] little thought and
[1:03:33] we might call that the abcs of it all or
[1:03:35] just the foundation of it all but
[1:03:37] that's just what the lord laid on my
[1:03:38] heart to speak so i trust that it'll be
[1:03:40] a blessing to you
[1:03:41] luke 24 and we'll begin uh
[1:03:46] with verse 44. and he said unto them
[1:03:50] luke 25 4 verse 44.
[1:03:53] and he said unto them these are the
[1:03:55] words which i spake unto you while i was
[1:03:57] yet with you
[1:03:58] that all things must be fulfilled which
[1:03:59] were written in the law of moses and of
[1:04:01] the prophets and the psalms concerning
[1:04:02] me
[1:04:03] then open to their understanding that
[1:04:05] they might understand
[1:04:07] in the scriptures and said unto them
[1:04:09] thus it is written
[1:04:11] and thus it behooves christ to suffer
[1:04:14] and to rise from the dead the third day
[1:04:16] and
[1:04:17] that repentance and remissions of sins
[1:04:21] should be preached in his
[1:04:24] name amen among all nations
[1:04:28] beginning at jerusalem
[1:04:31] amen may god well evidence read rest and
[1:04:34] you are witness of these things and
[1:04:36] behold i send the promise of my father
[1:04:38] upon you
[1:04:39] but tarry ye injured in the city of
[1:04:41] jerusalem until ye be endued with power
[1:04:43] from on high
[1:04:45] amen god bless the reading of the words
[1:04:47] you can be seated this morning
[1:04:49] like i said uh last night as i've had
[1:04:51] been praying about what to speak on this
[1:04:53] word repentance came to my mind and
[1:04:56] and and so it just began to
[1:05:01] multiply amen and the lord seemed to
[1:05:03] just bless that thought and i says well
[1:05:05] you lord if that's what you want me to
[1:05:06] speak on that's what we'll speak on this
[1:05:08] morning with the help of the lord
[1:05:11] amen so we see here that uh you know
[1:05:14] there is another scripture
[1:05:16] and you know one you know baptism and
[1:05:17] repentance and the plan of salvation
[1:05:21] uh i mean it's the most important
[1:05:23] subject really there is when you think
[1:05:25] about it and that right
[1:05:26] and it's certainly a most controversial
[1:05:29] subject amongst many different groups of
[1:05:32] people
[1:05:33] a lot of people think of it different
[1:05:35] and see it different and you know and
[1:05:37] and if i might just repeat you know
[1:05:39] something that was told me this morning
[1:05:41] and as somebody
[1:05:42] saying you know the bible well you know
[1:05:44] i was told that you know the bible says
[1:05:45] if thou
[1:05:46] believest if i believe you know it
[1:05:48] doesn't really matter whether i'm
[1:05:49] baptized
[1:05:50] or not you don't really have to be
[1:05:51] baptized you know
[1:05:53] and my response was you know whether
[1:05:55] what i say isn't
[1:05:56] important and what you hear isn't
[1:05:57] important what you've been taught isn't
[1:05:59] important
[1:05:59] there's only one thing that really
[1:06:01] matters and that is what did god say
[1:06:03] about
[1:06:04] it that's only really mattered it's just
[1:06:06] what does the bible say about it i mean
[1:06:08] that's ultimately what's important it's
[1:06:11] not what i think or anybody else it's
[1:06:12] what the bible says amen
[1:06:14] amen and so we we realized one place
[1:06:16] that paul said when he was
[1:06:19] you know the the angels came and broke
[1:06:22] uh paul and silas out of jail you know
[1:06:25] and uh the
[1:06:27] policeman that was their guard was about
[1:06:29] to fall on him
[1:06:30] on his sword and kill himself because he
[1:06:34] knew it was death
[1:06:35] for him to let his prisoners escape and
[1:06:38] he's
[1:06:38] paul yelled out says don't do yourself
[1:06:40] any harm you know
[1:06:42] you know we're all here we're still here
[1:06:43] you know and that taylor
[1:06:45] asked him he says now what must i do to
[1:06:47] be saved amen
[1:06:49] and paul made this simple statement
[1:06:51] believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:06:53] and thou shalt be saved amen how many
[1:06:55] knows that he that believeth and
[1:06:58] is baptized shall be saved amen but it
[1:07:00] doesn't just say that
[1:07:02] in that certain place it also talks
[1:07:04] about repentance
[1:07:05] amen in that right and the remissions of
[1:07:07] sins and then it also
[1:07:08] talks about the baptism of the holy
[1:07:10] ghost when jesus come along we said you
[1:07:12] know
[1:07:12] unless a man is born again he cannot
[1:07:14] enter the kingdom of heaven again so we
[1:07:16] have
[1:07:17] the born-again issue that we have to do
[1:07:19] the doctrine of the new birth that we
[1:07:20] have to deal with
[1:07:21] and with the help of the lord if you
[1:07:22] don't mind i'd like to go into some of
[1:07:24] those things would that be all right
[1:07:26] strangely but i know we're having a
[1:07:27] baptism this morning and i said you know
[1:07:29] maybe
[1:07:30] the lord will just have us to go in that
[1:07:31] because one thing's for sure is
[1:07:33] the one desire that we have and that is
[1:07:35] that we want to be pleasing to god
[1:07:38] amen the first commandment of all
[1:07:40] commandments is that you're supposed
[1:07:42] to love the lord your god with all your
[1:07:44] heart with all your mind with all your
[1:07:47] soul and all your strength amen
[1:07:48] how many knows that's god's commandment
[1:07:50] amen that you're supposed to love him
[1:07:51] with everything that you got
[1:07:53] and that's what we want to do with the
[1:07:55] help of the lord
[1:07:57] but here he talks about that you're
[1:07:58] supposed to go and preach this gospel to
[1:08:00] every creature
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:04] amen now notice the gospel preaching the
[1:08:06] gospel he didn't so go you into all the
[1:08:08] world and build churches
[1:08:09] make the nominations he said they built
[1:08:12] hospitals and all these other things he
[1:08:14] says go and preach the gospel to every
[1:08:16] creature
[1:08:18] now i'll say this that i truly believe
[1:08:20] that of everything that is done
[1:08:22] everything that we do everything that
[1:08:24] the church does still
[1:08:25] i believe the most important agenda
[1:08:28] that the church of the living god has is
[1:08:30] to preach the gospel
[1:08:33] the more important thing that we can do
[1:08:35] is to preach the gospel
[1:08:36] to every creature amen
[1:08:39] into all the world jesus said notice how
[1:08:43] he would
[1:08:43] after his resurrection amen after he
[1:08:46] comes back and he eats fish and so forth
[1:08:49] amen and then the last thing that he
[1:08:52] tells his disciples to do is to go and
[1:08:55] preach the gospel to every creature
[1:08:57] so it must be very important amen
[1:08:59] preaching the gospel
[1:09:00] is the most important thing that there
[1:09:02] is now over in the book of revelation
[1:09:04] john the revelator if you remember
[1:09:06] amen we won't get into reading it but
[1:09:09] you i think it's the fifth chapter
[1:09:11] he says you know when he found that amen
[1:09:13] that there he found that no man was
[1:09:15] worthy to take the book
[1:09:17] and to open the seals thereof or to even
[1:09:20] look upon it in other words the whole
[1:09:22] plan of salvation
[1:09:24] the whole plan of redemption in other
[1:09:27] words
[1:09:28] all of humanity all right
[1:09:31] every one of us would be lost
[1:09:36] all right lost meaning that we would
[1:09:39] come to annihilation
[1:09:41] right there was no salvation for
[1:09:44] any of us there would be no salvation
[1:09:47] there would be no need of preaching the
[1:09:49] gospel
[1:09:49] if there wouldn't be somebody that would
[1:09:52] have been worthy
[1:09:53] to take the book and to open the seals
[1:09:57] amen and that would be worthy to pay the
[1:10:00] price for humanity
[1:10:01] are we glad this morning that there is
[1:10:03] somebody that was worthy
[1:10:09] because if it wouldn't have been for
[1:10:10] that worthy one amen there would be no
[1:10:13] sense in us coming to church
[1:10:16] you would be without hope amen you could
[1:10:19] not even come to repentance
[1:10:22] now the reason that i read these other
[1:10:24] scriptures about repentance is because
[1:10:26] if you'll notice the very thing that
[1:10:28] john the baptist did
[1:10:30] when he began to go and when he began to
[1:10:32] preach what was the first thing he said
[1:10:36] repent
[1:10:39] what was the first thing that jesus said
[1:10:42] when he began to preach the gospel
[1:10:44] repent
[1:10:48] repent for the kingdom of heaven is
[1:10:51] at hand in other words if to repent from
[1:10:55] something is to
[1:10:56] turn around and go a different direction
[1:11:00] in other words stop you're going the
[1:11:03] wrong way
[1:11:04] how many know this world is heading
[1:11:06] headlong amen in a desperate way the
[1:11:09] wrong way
[1:11:12] you and i after we come to the age of
[1:11:14] accountability when you get to be about
[1:11:16] 12 13 maybe even younger nowadays but
[1:11:18] you'll begin to sin and you'll be able
[1:11:20] to
[1:11:20] you'll begin to do things that's wrong
[1:11:21] you'll realize that hey
[1:11:23] i have the wrong desires in my heart and
[1:11:26] i'm going the wrong way
[1:11:33] amen because until you come to this
[1:11:35] place
[1:11:36] amen of salvation isn't going to be any
[1:11:38] good for you
[1:11:40] because that's part of the plan of
[1:11:43] salvation
[1:11:44] that's the part that's part of preaching
[1:11:47] the gospel
[1:11:49] and to every creature is repent
[1:11:54] turn around amen
[1:11:57] so we see that go into all the world
[1:12:01] and jesus here clearly makes a statement
[1:12:05] of
[1:12:06] that it was christ
[1:12:09] that it was behold christ to suffer and
[1:12:12] to rise from the dead
[1:12:13] the third day that repentance and
[1:12:15] recimptions of sins
[1:12:17] notice your repentance and your
[1:12:19] remissions of sins
[1:12:21] should be preached in his name
[1:12:27] now let me ask you is his name father
[1:12:31] is his name son is his name holy ghost
[1:12:36] that's not his name is that right and so
[1:12:40] many people listen
[1:12:41] i've talked to people i don't know if i
[1:12:42] ever ran into one myself but there's
[1:12:44] pentecostals from what i understand
[1:12:46] because
[1:12:48] they're the ones that were supposed to
[1:12:49] get the revelation of acts 2 38
[1:12:52] of the holy ghost and so forth and the
[1:12:54] baptism they were they were supposed to
[1:12:55] have it right
[1:12:56] but they ended up splitting into oneness
[1:12:58] twoness and trinity
[1:13:00] pentecostal trinity now that's what
[1:13:01] blows my mind how can you be pentecostal
[1:13:04] amen amen acts 2 amen and then still not
[1:13:07] understand the simplicity of matthew 28
[1:13:10] and 18
[1:13:11] of who the father is who the son is and
[1:13:14] who the holy ghost how could jesus
[1:13:16] possibly be still trinity but it's
[1:13:18] simply because people listen
[1:13:20] people have a certain way they see it
[1:13:22] they put a period behind what they
[1:13:24] believe and god
[1:13:25] can't deal with them anymore you put a
[1:13:28] period behind what you believe and guess
[1:13:30] what
[1:13:30] god can't deal with you anymore i've
[1:13:33] been preaching 30 years and there's more
[1:13:35] new things that god shows me all the
[1:13:36] time
[1:13:38] if i wouldn't be open for more
[1:13:39] revelation i'll tell you what i would
[1:13:41] become stagnant i'd become lukewarm
[1:13:45] amen but notice here he talks about how
[1:13:48] that
[1:13:48] and he talks about the name used name
[1:13:50] and what i wanted to say when i began to
[1:13:52] say this was this that
[1:13:53] some people will get plum upset not even
[1:13:56] come to your church
[1:13:57] amen they will just man they'll blast
[1:13:59] you to hell
[1:14:00] if you baptize in jesus name
[1:14:06] can you imagine a christian
[1:14:10] that would actually blast you to hell
[1:14:12] because you actually use the name of the
[1:14:14] lord jesus christ in baptism
[1:14:16] but he's the one that died for you he's
[1:14:20] the one that paid the price it don't
[1:14:21] take a genius
[1:14:22] to figure that out
[1:14:27] but what does it show let me tell you
[1:14:29] what it shows
[1:14:30] thomas byler it shows that they have a
[1:14:33] wrong spirit
[1:14:34] in their heart and let me tell you
[1:14:36] something you may not think it's very
[1:14:38] strong
[1:14:38] but catholicism i'll tell you what they
[1:14:41] they would
[1:14:42] kill you they would crucify you if you
[1:14:44] wouldn't do this cross
[1:14:45] embrace the cross and father son and
[1:14:48] holy is a trinity spirit
[1:14:49] it's actually a false doctrine spirit
[1:14:51] that they take
[1:14:52] and it's a hateful spirit don't get me
[1:14:55] wrong
[1:14:56] it is a hateful spirit the trinity
[1:14:58] spirit is
[1:15:00] all different people hate you if you
[1:15:02] don't believe in the
[1:15:03] trinity amen but let me tell you
[1:15:06] something but i'll tell you what
[1:15:07] we're in a whole lot of trouble if
[1:15:09] there's contradictions in here
[1:15:11] i'd rather take what jesus said than
[1:15:13] what peter said if there's a
[1:15:14] contradiction
[1:15:15] what can we really believe
[1:15:19] oh my but it isn't i'm not so thankful
[1:15:22] there is no contradiction my i'm a
[1:15:26] father
[1:15:27] amen i am a father i am a son and i am
[1:15:30] have the holy ghost but that's not my
[1:15:33] name
[1:15:34] and jesus says i want you to use the
[1:15:36] name of the father the son
[1:15:38] and the holy ghost i want you to use his
[1:15:40] name
[1:15:41] and when peter did it huh
[1:15:44] father being lord isn't that right
[1:15:48] know that the lord your god is one lord
[1:15:50] his name is is the lord
[1:15:52] the lord is the father and then jesus
[1:15:54] was the son
[1:15:56] lord jesus and christ
[1:15:59] is the holy ghost amen the lord jesus
[1:16:02] christ was perfect
[1:16:05] amen it doesn't even take a deep
[1:16:08] revelation
[1:16:09] you don't even have to have a spiritual
[1:16:11] awakening
[1:16:12] to see the baptism
[1:16:16] amen simple truth and then
[1:16:19] then you can say this that if anybody
[1:16:22] any show me anywhere
[1:16:24] anybody was ever baptized in the name of
[1:16:26] the father son the holy ghost
[1:16:27] now i got to rephrase it because even
[1:16:29] the prophet used that
[1:16:31] he said show me where anybody was
[1:16:32] baptized in the name of the father son
[1:16:34] the holy ghost
[1:16:35] that always needs to be said this way
[1:16:38] show me where they were
[1:16:39] baptized in the titles of the fathers on
[1:16:41] the holy ghost
[1:16:42] okay because if you say show me where
[1:16:44] they use the name of the fathers on the
[1:16:45] holy ghost
[1:16:46] every time they use the name of jesus
[1:16:47] christ they use the name of the father
[1:16:49] son the holy ghost
[1:16:50] they did use the name of the fathers on
[1:16:51] the holy ghost they used the name of
[1:16:52] jesus christ that's what they used
[1:16:54] but the titles of father son and holy
[1:16:56] ghost nobody ever used the titles of
[1:16:58] fathers on the holy ghost
[1:17:00] oh that's not really important then why
[1:17:02] did they say in the book of acts that
[1:17:04] there is no other name given under every
[1:17:06] whereby you must be saved
[1:17:08] not any other name is given it's not
[1:17:11] muhammad it's not all any of these
[1:17:13] others there ain't
[1:17:14] no name that you can get saved under
[1:17:16] except the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:17:18] the bible says that at the end every
[1:17:20] knee shall bow every tongue confess that
[1:17:23] jesus christ is lord
[1:17:26] that he is lord of all praise be to god
[1:17:30] all right so i didn't really mean to go
[1:17:31] in that direction but i just thought
[1:17:33] that's exactly true thinking
[1:17:34] repentance and remissions of sins should
[1:17:37] be preached in his name
[1:17:38] i am a happy man
[1:17:42] why because remissions of sins
[1:17:46] has been made available through the
[1:17:49] blood of jesus christ
[1:17:52] hallelujah aren't you glad for
[1:17:54] forgiveness
[1:17:56] i want you to know it doesn't i'm here
[1:17:58] to tell you i don't care what your
[1:17:59] condition outside of blasphemy of the
[1:18:01] holy ghost
[1:18:02] if you're still a monk in sin if you
[1:18:05] still have a heart that's not right with
[1:18:06] god
[1:18:07] this morning i believe there is mercy
[1:18:09] for you
[1:18:10] the day is coming when there won't be
[1:18:12] but i believe there's mercy for you this
[1:18:14] morning
[1:18:15] whatever your condition is outside of
[1:18:17] the blasphemy of the holy ghost
[1:18:20] if you're not what you ought to be
[1:18:22] praise be to god
[1:18:25] amen
[1:18:28] amen sister riva good to see you amen
[1:18:32] i met your husband he's a good man i
[1:18:34] really appreciate him gotten to know him
[1:18:36] the last few weeks i've gotten to be
[1:18:37] friends but i did
[1:18:38] i said well what about your wife have
[1:18:40] you got a wife he says yeah i got wife's
[1:18:41] history when he told me how good he was
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:44] but anyway so praise the lord all right
[1:18:46] now think about this so he says
[1:18:47] repentance and remissions of sin should
[1:18:49] be preached in his name
[1:18:51] beginning where at jerusalem
[1:18:55] oh my we're going to go to jerusalem
[1:18:58] we know that they were in the upper room
[1:19:00] or in that right
[1:19:01] in the upper room and they were waiting
[1:19:03] for the baptism of the holy ghost came
[1:19:06] amen and it says that you know that
[1:19:09] you're the post supposed to wait there
[1:19:10] until you receive power from on high
[1:19:13] verse eight if chapter one says and you
[1:19:14] shall receive power after the holy ghost
[1:19:17] has come upon you
[1:19:18] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:19:20] in jerusalem and judea
[1:19:22] and in the other most parts of the earth
[1:19:24] now we realize that
[1:19:25] the whole pentecostal world was based on
[1:19:28] acts 2
[1:19:30] amen and starting with verse 1 when the
[1:19:32] whole
[1:19:33] the pandey penny was cost was fully come
[1:19:36] they were in one place they were in one
[1:19:38] accord
[1:19:40] oh my i wanted you to know i
[1:19:44] absolutely believe that god could if he
[1:19:46] could bind us together
[1:19:47] with such unity even this morning i
[1:19:50] believe that even jesus's presence
[1:19:52] the holy ghost could come down here just
[1:19:54] like he did back then
[1:19:56] it is not just about a a god of history
[1:19:59] but it's a god of now if your heart will
[1:20:02] get right if my heart will get
[1:20:04] right god will come and he'll bring this
[1:20:06] place amen and many times i've heard of
[1:20:08] services where can holy ghost come so
[1:20:10] great
[1:20:10] until the place becomes smokey made a
[1:20:13] place this morning
[1:20:14] becomes smoky amen just may there be
[1:20:18] licks of fire may there
[1:20:19] be a pill of fire come among us if you
[1:20:22] can get your heart right
[1:20:23] get your mind right he didn't want a
[1:20:26] cart
[1:20:28] but that's what it'll take folks we're
[1:20:31] not just here to hear a preacher preach
[1:20:33] you're not just here to warm up here
[1:20:35] we're here to worship the lord our god
[1:20:38] that made us that give us breath that
[1:20:40] give us life
[1:20:42] and i believe that as time goes on the
[1:20:44] true elect people of god
[1:20:46] you'll draw closer to him closer to him
[1:20:48] we're not getting further away from god
[1:20:50] we want to get closer to god like
[1:20:52] brother david said
[1:20:54] i want a closer walk with him
[1:20:57] oh my
[1:21:01] i guarantee you the one thing you'll
[1:21:02] take out of every one of us
[1:21:05] is repentance that's right
[1:21:12] repentance
[1:21:14] repentance you're going one direction
[1:21:17] you need to stop going that way because
[1:21:20] let me tell you something there's only
[1:21:22] two ways in this world
[1:21:24] there's only two ways jesus says there's
[1:21:27] one that leads
[1:21:28] to destruction it's real white and
[1:21:32] there'll be many that go in there out
[1:21:34] there's a lot of people going the
[1:21:36] broadway
[1:21:40] yeah but the later way of life is a
[1:21:43] narrow way
[1:21:45] and it says and there be few that find
[1:21:48] it
[1:21:50] there's a few on this narrow path
[1:21:53] let me tell you what the broad way is
[1:21:54] you know what the broad way is
[1:21:57] the broad way it way is your way
[1:22:04] your way two ways one is your way
[1:22:07] and one is god's way amen
[1:22:11] two way directions now i want to say
[1:22:14] this
[1:22:14] let me tell you what hell is going to be
[1:22:16] full of
[1:22:18] hell is going to be full of people
[1:22:21] who want it to go their way but they
[1:22:23] still wanted salvation
[1:22:24] they also wanted god's way attached to
[1:22:28] their way
[1:22:29] huh they want to mix it up
[1:22:32] they want it both ways well i still want
[1:22:36] to do what i want to do
[1:22:38] but i want to be saved i want the holy
[1:22:40] ghost
[1:22:41] i want to be a christian but i still
[1:22:42] want to do this and i want to do that
[1:22:43] and
[1:22:44] i think that the bible means this and
[1:22:46] the bible meant that and this side or
[1:22:47] the other
[1:22:48] huh no it don't work that way
[1:22:52] because i want to tell you something the
[1:22:53] bible says that he deceiveth the whole
[1:22:56] world except for those who have their
[1:22:59] names written on the book of life
[1:23:01] from the foundation of the world see the
[1:23:04] devil is a deceiver
[1:23:06] and that's what the world is going to be
[1:23:08] mostly done by and that is they're going
[1:23:10] to be deceived
[1:23:12] they're going to think that what they're
[1:23:13] doing is right the way that they're
[1:23:15] going is right
[1:23:17] but it's going to be the wrong way amen
[1:23:22] when i begin to think about going the
[1:23:23] wrong direction
[1:23:26] now begin to think about how that it's
[1:23:29] basically it's like being on that river
[1:23:32] that comes down to the niagara falls
[1:23:35] and every one of us is on that river
[1:23:38] all right and we're all headed towards
[1:23:41] the
[1:23:42] niagara falls no way for you to survive
[1:23:45] all right and you've got a boat all
[1:23:48] right and you're going down there and
[1:23:49] you're floating down there and you're
[1:23:51] just having a good time the sun's
[1:23:52] shining everything's nice
[1:23:53] you got your little zipcode you're just
[1:23:55] a fish in the way you're enjoying life
[1:23:57] this is nice life is good
[1:24:02] and then there's somebody on the bank
[1:24:04] says hey
[1:24:05] you better be careful the falls is just
[1:24:08] up ahead
[1:24:10] huh and that's the preacher telling hey
[1:24:12] guess what
[1:24:13] you're gonna come down to the deathbed
[1:24:15] one of these days
[1:24:18] you're gonna come down to that far
[1:24:19] you're gonna come down to the place
[1:24:21] where
[1:24:23] i mean can you get on your desk
[1:24:29] all we can do is send you hospice
[1:24:33] huh coming down to hospice
[1:24:36] if time terrors you understand the
[1:24:38] rapture don't take place
[1:24:40] and you know you're not going to think
[1:24:41] about how much money you make
[1:24:44] you probably won't even think too much
[1:24:45] about your eye for your children you
[1:24:47] might be concerned about whether they're
[1:24:48] taken care of
[1:24:49] but your focus is not going to be on the
[1:24:51] things of this world anymore
[1:24:54] your thought is going to be i'm going to
[1:24:56] meet jesus jesus are you going to be
[1:24:58] here
[1:24:59] for me because they can't go with me i
[1:25:02] got to go by myself here
[1:25:03] this is a journey i got to make by
[1:25:05] myself i'm coming down to this place
[1:25:07] where i draw my wrath path what happens
[1:25:09] after that
[1:25:10] huh you see what would i what would you
[1:25:13] do this morning brother john
[1:25:15] if i told you brother john i'm dying i
[1:25:17] found out yesterday i'm dying
[1:25:21] what would you all think if i told you
[1:25:23] better i'm not very long
[1:25:24] doctor says i'm dying
[1:25:28] huh but you know
[1:25:32] that's exactly what i am that's exactly
[1:25:35] what you are
[1:25:37] i'm a dying man talking to a dying
[1:25:40] people
[1:25:42] huh so you see when you come to the
[1:25:45] house of god how many please this is a
[1:25:46] serious thing
[1:25:48] this morning is as serious as you being
[1:25:50] on your deathbed
[1:25:52] because that's what we're getting ready
[1:25:54] for we're getting ready for what's over
[1:25:55] on the other side
[1:25:57] we're not thinking about a job we're not
[1:25:58] thinking about we're finding out
[1:26:00] where are you at with god
[1:26:04] where are you amen
[1:26:08] tremendous place
[1:26:11] to be so you find
[1:26:17] a man on the shore calling you better
[1:26:20] watch out he says oh i'm
[1:26:21] okay i'm okay
[1:26:24] and the man on the river the preacher on
[1:26:27] the river
[1:26:28] side on the banks looks
[1:26:31] and guess what you have on your boat
[1:26:33] you're in a boat
[1:26:35] and guess what you have on your boat
[1:26:38] you've got a 200 horse mercury let's say
[1:26:41] 250 i like the big ones don't you
[1:26:45] 250 mark i'm telling you what it's fuel
[1:26:49] injected

[1:26:54] huh put that throttle on
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:00] yeah that's why i'm up huh
[1:27:05] and all of a sudden you're going down he
[1:27:07] says that you only have a quarter of a
[1:27:08] mile you better crank that end it up and
[1:27:10] turn it around
[1:27:12] and the person on the boat says i don't
[1:27:13] know i've never used that engine
[1:27:17] i don't believe it'll run
[1:27:20] what would you do no no no crank it up
[1:27:25] you better try it try it you better you
[1:27:26] better crank up
[1:27:29] cause you got very long now i got my
[1:27:33] paddle here
[1:27:34] i got my paddle i got my weight let me
[1:27:36] do it my way
[1:27:38] just shut up i got my paddle i roll with
[1:27:41] huh
[1:27:42] that's what people are doing
[1:27:45] god will come and he'll discern the
[1:27:47] thoughts and intents of the heart he'll
[1:27:48] do miracles after miracles and that's
[1:27:50] just nothing
[1:27:51] doesn't mean anything to people anymore
[1:27:54] huh
[1:27:56] the woman that do well i'd love to hear
[1:27:57] the woman at the well when god did that
[1:27:59] in our generation hundreds and thousands
[1:28:01] of times but people will ignore it
[1:28:03] go ahead go away but god is calling you
[1:28:06] know
[1:28:07] and and guess what you say look you
[1:28:09] better you better turn around you're
[1:28:11] going the wrong way you're headed for
[1:28:12] the fall
[1:28:14] but see that kind of fall is eternal
[1:28:17] separation from god
[1:28:19] let's go to it's to go to a place that
[1:28:21] you'll call god help me
[1:28:23] you'll call mom dad god help me and
[1:28:25] there's no god there
[1:28:27] eternal separation from god and
[1:28:29] violation after the
[1:28:31] throne judgment so what does the
[1:28:34] preacher do
[1:28:36] well i tried to tell him
[1:28:39] i guess i'll go back up to my picnic
[1:28:41] they're just floating on down
[1:28:43] just let them go i told them they're
[1:28:44] going to crash you can't stand that far
[1:28:48] i told you to try to crank that engine
[1:28:50] up
[1:28:51] turn around repent repent
[1:28:55] ah no we don't go back to the picnic
[1:28:58] what do we do we run down the along the
[1:29:01] banks
[1:29:02] look come on please wake up you got it
[1:29:05] you got to turn around
[1:29:06] you got to repent you got to go a
[1:29:09] different direction
[1:29:10] you can't go your way it leads to
[1:29:13] destruction
[1:29:14] there's a way that seems right unto a
[1:29:16] man at the end they're aware of
[1:29:18] is death amen you're going
[1:29:22] you know and all you got to do is look i
[1:29:24] see the engine
[1:29:26] turn the key a little bit see the lights
[1:29:28] come on
[1:29:29] he turns the key i see light but i don't
[1:29:31] think it'll start i don't believe it
[1:29:34] huh what will happen to that man if you
[1:29:37] don't take faith if you don't believe
[1:29:39] he'll go off let me tell you something
[1:29:42] that 250 mark
[1:29:44] amen that is called faith amen
[1:29:47] that little engine is called faith if
[1:29:50] thou
[1:29:51] canst believe he that believeth shall be
[1:29:54] saved
[1:29:55] and then he that takes the key and turns
[1:29:58] it amen if let begin to say god i
[1:30:00] believe your word
[1:30:02] i believe your word i believe every word
[1:30:06] that's the problem today if people don't
[1:30:08] believe every word
[1:30:09] and jesus said man shall not live by
[1:30:11] portion of the word that you want to
[1:30:12] take
[1:30:13] no but man shall live by every word that
[1:30:15] proceeded out of the mouth of god
[1:30:18] should a man live by
[1:30:21] amen i don't care what part of this
[1:30:26] salvation forgiveness a pardon
[1:30:30] how many believes that this book is a
[1:30:32] pardon from almighty god
[1:30:35] whosoever believeth shall be saved
[1:30:38] that's the everybody didn't have your
[1:30:41] name or anybody else's name now god
[1:30:42] wrote your name down because he knew
[1:30:44] what to
[1:30:44] do with it or whether he wouldn't that's
[1:30:46] how he could write your name on the book
[1:30:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:49] because he's infinite he knows everybody
[1:30:52] that had
[1:30:53] had that desire that would want it he
[1:30:55] knew
[1:30:56] he knows those who wouldn't care
[1:31:00] see kane let me talk to you about cain
[1:31:02] for a minute cain was the kind of guy
[1:31:03] that wanted his own way
[1:31:04] but yet he wanted salvation or he never
[1:31:06] had a church
[1:31:08] cain had a beautiful church he brought
[1:31:10] flowers he brought sacrifices and he
[1:31:12] made the altar call
[1:31:13] and then he had altar called he had all
[1:31:15] kinds of things at the altar for
[1:31:17] sacrifice sure he wanted to be right
[1:31:20] but he still wanted his own way he was a
[1:31:23] religious man that's the way people are
[1:31:25] today people
[1:31:26] they want god they want to go to church
[1:31:28] they want to feel right
[1:31:30] sure but they still want to have their
[1:31:33] own way
[1:31:35] amen
[1:31:39] they want to take their cigarettes with
[1:31:41] them they want to take their
[1:31:43] drugs with them they want to take their
[1:31:45] lusts with them they want to
[1:31:48] all kinds of things they don't want to
[1:31:49] repent
[1:31:53] amen repentance
[1:31:56] amen repentance now before i go into my
[1:32:00] main thought
[1:32:01] i want to go to um let me see here
[1:32:07] acts 2 i guess it is because we will
[1:32:10] talk about the new birth for just a
[1:32:11] minute
[1:32:13] repentance and the new birth
[1:32:17] because you know how many knows that
[1:32:19] repentance is truly what leads you
[1:32:21] to the new birth so many people
[1:32:24] don't want to repent but they want the
[1:32:26] holy ghost
[1:32:28] they don't want to repent if they're
[1:32:29] wrong and so forth but they still want
[1:32:31] to be saved
[1:32:32] and you can't you got to be willing to
[1:32:34] repent and turn around
[1:32:39] it takes a turning around
[1:32:42] acts 2 now we know that peter had the
[1:32:45] keys of the kingdom in that right
[1:32:47] i give you the keys to the kingdom of
[1:32:49] heaven and here he is
[1:32:50] unlocking the door amen
[1:32:54] and peter of course after they were
[1:32:56] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:32:58] because you're not really willing let me
[1:33:00] tell you can we just go slow here
[1:33:03] you're not really ready to be a witness
[1:33:05] for christ until you
[1:33:07] get the bad baptism of the holy ghost
[1:33:11] because we could talk about hey you need
[1:33:12] the baptism the holy ghost what if i was
[1:33:14] up here and didn't have the baptism and
[1:33:15] holy ghost
[1:33:17] well you know it would just be sad
[1:33:19] wouldn't it yes it would
[1:33:21] but you have to have the power let me
[1:33:22] tell you something one thing that the
[1:33:24] holy ghost does
[1:33:25] it gives you the power to become the
[1:33:26] sons of god
[1:33:28] it gives you the power to be a witness
[1:33:30] and so they had gotten the holy ghost
[1:33:31] and then they went outside amen and this
[1:33:34] is where
[1:33:35] actually the pentecost let me just say
[1:33:38] this this is where the pentecostals make
[1:33:40] their
[1:33:40] mistake is acts 2
[1:33:44] and verse 4. now that's their theme
[1:33:47] scene scripture he says and they were
[1:33:49] all filled with the holy ghost and began
[1:33:52] to speak with other tongues
[1:33:53] as the spirit gave to motherings now you
[1:33:56] wasn't really a member of the church you
[1:33:58] wasn't really
[1:33:59] a pentecostal you weren't really born
[1:34:01] again
[1:34:02] to them unless you had that speaking in
[1:34:05] tongues
[1:34:06] they honed down and says unless a person
[1:34:08] or when a person does speak in tongues
[1:34:11] it is the evidence they got the holy
[1:34:13] ghost that's what they made they made
[1:34:15] actually a church doctrine out of it
[1:34:18] amen everybody knows they honed down and
[1:34:21] says that's the evidence of the holy
[1:34:23] ghost
[1:34:24] oh read verse 4 let's see if it reads
[1:34:25] that and verse 5 says then this
[1:34:28] is the evidence that you are born again
[1:34:30] no i didn't read anything like that
[1:34:32] it's just that they and other places
[1:34:34] listen the other places they
[1:34:36] they were speaking in tongues many
[1:34:38] places they did speak in tongues
[1:34:40] but speaking in tongues is not the
[1:34:41] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:34:44] amen it is believing
[1:34:47] the word of god that's what the evidence
[1:34:50] is
[1:34:50] amen now so we'll not go too much on
[1:34:53] that but listen that's where they made
[1:34:54] the mistake was to
[1:34:55] to actually indoctrinate and come up
[1:34:57] with a thought that the bible never said
[1:34:59] because as we know the prophet said man
[1:35:01] he's seen witch doctors
[1:35:02] take infants go up and let them speak
[1:35:05] and unknown tongues interpret it
[1:35:07] and drink blood out of the humans call
[1:35:10] and they were speaking in tongues why
[1:35:11] did they have the holy ghost no they
[1:35:13] didn't hello that's not the evidence of
[1:35:15] the holy ghost it could happen
[1:35:16] speaking in tongues there's nothing
[1:35:18] wrong with speaking in tongues amen
[1:35:21] so he got filled with the fire peter
[1:35:24] preached we're not going to go through
[1:35:25] all of that but he went and preached a
[1:35:27] great
[1:35:27] message to all of the israelites
[1:35:30] okay and then at the end of his message
[1:35:34] in verse
[1:35:35] around verse 36 peter says in the ending
[1:35:39] he says you know therefore let all the
[1:35:40] house of israel know assuredly
[1:35:42] that god has made all right god has made
[1:35:46] this same jesus whom ye have crucified
[1:35:50] both lord and
[1:35:54] christ amen that's why we say he's the
[1:35:57] lord
[1:35:59] jesus is lord lord of all
[1:36:02] and christ he's
[1:36:06] the anointing now notice
[1:36:09] then when they heard this they were
[1:36:11] pricked in their heart
[1:36:13] and said unto peter and to the rest of
[1:36:15] the apostles
[1:36:16] men and brethren how long do we have to
[1:36:18] go
[1:36:20] and and go to some instruction class for
[1:36:23] about six months
[1:36:25] that what he said which i watched people
[1:36:27] say
[1:36:29] you know because we want to make sure we
[1:36:30] never baptize somebody that ain't really
[1:36:32] dedicated i don't want to either
[1:36:37] we want to make sure that whoever's
[1:36:38] repenting but guess what
[1:36:40] that's not in your power amen
[1:36:44] you don't unless you can read minds
[1:36:46] unless you know that way
[1:36:48] hey i know if this person's genuine
[1:36:50] sincere or whether they're not
[1:36:53] and guess what i guess peter would have
[1:36:55] been pretty busy because three thousand
[1:36:57] souls to baptize in one day
[1:36:59] it had been busy counseling and i like
[1:37:01] to consult with somebody see how sincere
[1:37:03] they are
[1:37:04] but listen he says men and brethren what
[1:37:06] shall we do
[1:37:08] peter said unto them join church
[1:37:13] just believe that's all you need to do
[1:37:16] no
[1:37:17] he said repent first thing you've got to
[1:37:19] do
[1:37:20] if you want to serve god is turn from
[1:37:22] all your wicked ways
[1:37:25] amen you gotta it's it's part of this
[1:37:27] repentance is
[1:37:28] part of dying to yourself
[1:37:33] that's why a new purse is placed taking
[1:37:35] place
[1:37:36] you are dying to your thoughts your
[1:37:38] ideas your life
[1:37:40] god is fixing to buy you because you're
[1:37:42] selling
[1:37:43] you're selling out to god you're selling
[1:37:46] your everything to god
[1:37:47] you're repenting of everything say god i
[1:37:50] don't want to think my thoughts
[1:37:51] i want you to have control of my life
[1:37:54] anything that's wrong lord shall
[1:37:56] make and i'll do right am i right
[1:38:00] repent turn around every one of you has
[1:38:03] to turn around
[1:38:04] quit doing the things that you're doing
[1:38:08] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:38:11] name of jesus christ
[1:38:13] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[1:38:17] receive what the third part
[1:38:20] of the plan of salvation amen repent
[1:38:24] believe and get filled with the holy
[1:38:27] ghost
[1:38:28] you're not really complete without all
[1:38:30] three
[1:38:32] you have to repent you have to make a
[1:38:34] public confession that you believe the
[1:38:36] lord jesus christ and you're giving your
[1:38:38] heart and life to the lord
[1:38:39] by water baptism amen
[1:38:43] because i'll tell you what how many
[1:38:44] knows it's the blood of jesus christ
[1:38:45] that paid for your sins
[1:38:48] you mean some people think that when you
[1:38:50] that the actual water
[1:38:51] cleanses you huh
[1:38:54] the actual water doesn't cleanse you
[1:38:57] that's just an
[1:38:58] outward showing it's just one of the few
[1:39:00] things that god has asked us to do such
[1:39:02] as foot washing
[1:39:03] amen to communion and the baptism that's
[1:39:06] what he asked us to do
[1:39:10] amen be baptized every one of you in the
[1:39:14] name of jesus christ and you
[1:39:15] shall receive the holy ghost brother bam
[1:39:18] coming in contact with a lot of people
[1:39:20] who says brother branham we just speak
[1:39:22] where the bible speaks we're silent when
[1:39:24] the bible's silent but we're here to
[1:39:25] tell you that the
[1:39:26] ones that ever got the baptism the holy
[1:39:28] ghost with the 12 disciples
[1:39:31] now all i know is the man must not have
[1:39:34] read his bible a whole lot
[1:39:36] isn't that right because you go to acts
[1:39:38] 10 amen the house of cornelius everybody
[1:39:40] got filled with the holy ghost
[1:39:41] over in acts 19 amen paul talking to
[1:39:44] those disciples they got baptized with
[1:39:45] the holy ghost
[1:39:46] a lot of people are more than he says
[1:39:49] well look what about that and they try
[1:39:50] to say that the holy ghost isn't really
[1:39:52] for today
[1:39:53] it was just for back there how many
[1:39:56] knows that's all false doctrine
[1:39:58] i'm here to tell you when jesus said
[1:40:00] that many false prophets
[1:40:01] many false christs shall arise and
[1:40:04] deceive
[1:40:05] many it was absolutely the truth anybody
[1:40:08] that speaks to you contrary to this
[1:40:11] is a false teacher amen it's a false
[1:40:13] prophet it's a false christ
[1:40:17] remember this brother bannon when he
[1:40:19] went beyond the curtain of time and he's
[1:40:20] seen all of those the
[1:40:22] converts of history out of this
[1:40:23] generation amen and
[1:40:25] and so forth and when he reached over
[1:40:27] there he says are these all my converts
[1:40:28] and so forth
[1:40:29] and the angel said and brother man says
[1:40:30] i want to see jesus he says you can't
[1:40:33] see him he's higher up
[1:40:35] but before you get to see him you're
[1:40:36] going to have to be judged
[1:40:38] on what you preached every leader
[1:40:42] will be judged on what he preached how
[1:40:43] many knows that's why i tried to just
[1:40:45] say what
[1:40:46] and he said what paul did and i can go
[1:40:49] right back this is what we teach right
[1:40:50] here the body of the bible
[1:40:52] if brother branham didn't teach
[1:40:53] something out of the bible it's wrong
[1:40:55] but listen and listen and he says you
[1:40:57] know what he said my brother ram says
[1:40:59] i'm gonna have to be judged for what i
[1:41:00] preached
[1:41:02] he says well he has the angel well will
[1:41:04] paul have to be
[1:41:05] judged for what he preached and the
[1:41:07] angel said yes he will
[1:41:09] and the man says well praise be to god
[1:41:11] hallelujah we're going to be okay
[1:41:13] because i just preached what paul
[1:41:15] preached and those millions of souls
[1:41:17] that he seen over there
[1:41:18] all yelled out we are resting on that
[1:41:23] we're resting on that that you preach
[1:41:25] what paul preached not what somebody
[1:41:27] you know everybody every one of us has a
[1:41:29] thought that's why
[1:41:31] there's so many different denomination
[1:41:33] churches is because everybody has an
[1:41:34] idea
[1:41:35] everybody has a thought and you follow
[1:41:38] that thought follow that idea
[1:41:40] it'll split this church up quicker than
[1:41:42] what you can shake a stick
[1:41:44] that's why all the divisions are out
[1:41:45] there because people go with their ideas
[1:41:47] that's why pentecost failed
[1:41:48] the absolute devil got in amongst them
[1:41:50] and one and became a trinity and one
[1:41:52] thought
[1:41:53] they split over church things because
[1:41:55] one thought that god was coming on the
[1:41:57] white horse
[1:41:58] as he talks about him coming from the
[1:41:59] heavens of heaven on a white horse
[1:42:01] and others say no he went up in there's
[1:42:03] a cloud and he'll come back and say
[1:42:05] you're wrong i'm going to go over here
[1:42:06] and start my own church
[1:42:08] boy that's about as weak as the broth of
[1:42:10] a chicken
[1:42:11] of the shadow of a chicken that starved
[1:42:12] to death
[1:42:14] come on folks that's not but the devil
[1:42:17] gets in between our little bitty
[1:42:19] differences
[1:42:21] we gotta come back to the word of god
[1:42:22] how many please we gotta come back to
[1:42:24] the word of god cause that's our
[1:42:25] foundation there's nothing
[1:42:26] no other foundation lead than the
[1:42:28] foundation of the word of god
[1:42:30] amen praise the lord
[1:42:33] so we see here he says and you shall
[1:42:35] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:42:37] how does the new birth come in here then
[1:42:40] how do you say well brother balor if
[1:42:41] you're going to be saved you're going to
[1:42:42] have to have the new birth because jesus
[1:42:44] said so that's exactly right let's go
[1:42:46] see what jesus said
[1:42:47] when nicodemus in the third chapter of
[1:42:49] john
[1:42:50] came to him at night he says unto him
[1:42:53] rabbi we know that there are a teacher
[1:42:55] come from god for no man can do these
[1:42:56] miracles that thou doest
[1:42:58] except god be with him
[1:43:01] oh my the bible says that they'll come
[1:43:04] in that day and say heaven we cast out
[1:43:06] devils haven't we done this that or the
[1:43:07] other
[1:43:08] jesus will reply depart from me ye that
[1:43:11] work iniquity you know
[1:43:14] to do better but you didn't
[1:43:18] those are the kind of people that jesus
[1:43:19] is going to turn aside
[1:43:21] when you know that you ought to do
[1:43:22] better but you don't
[1:43:28] nicodemus and those rulers nicodemus
[1:43:31] confess
[1:43:32] we know that you're from god because
[1:43:35] nobody could do this unless they were of
[1:43:36] god
[1:43:37] but we're still not going to accept it
[1:43:38] even though we know to do better
[1:43:42] huh they confess it didn't he
[1:43:46] except god be with him and jesus
[1:43:48] answered and said on him verily verily i
[1:43:50] say unto you
[1:43:51] except the man be born again he cannot
[1:43:54] see the kingdom of heaven
[1:43:56] and of course nicodemus said can a man
[1:43:58] go back into his mother's womb a second
[1:44:00] time
[1:44:00] jesus says verily verily ex i say unto
[1:44:03] thee except a man be born of water
[1:44:06] and of spirit amen
[1:44:10] how many believes you've got to have the
[1:44:12] holy ghost to be saved
[1:44:14] amen the holy spirit has to come down
[1:44:15] into your soul amen not just on your
[1:44:17] flesh not just on your body
[1:44:19] but down into the outermost parts of
[1:44:21] your soul
[1:44:22] and change your very nature
[1:44:30] what did paul say about it paul said in
[1:44:32] the eighth chapter of romans
[1:44:36] he says but ye are not in the flesh
[1:44:39] but in the spirit if so be that the
[1:44:42] spirit of god dwell in you
[1:44:43] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:44:45] christ he
[1:44:47] is none of his
[1:44:50] how may believes that praise the lord
[1:44:55] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[1:44:58] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:45:01] because of righteousness
[1:45:02] but the spirit of him that raised up
[1:45:04] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:45:07] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:45:08] shall also quicken your more
[1:45:10] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:45:13] dwelleth in you well that's what we need
[1:45:15] more of
[1:45:15] is the quickening power of the holy
[1:45:17] ghost in our life to bring us to life
[1:45:20] amen how many knows that when jesus
[1:45:22] christ accepts
[1:45:24] your repentance this is the difference
[1:45:26] between the holy ghost
[1:45:28] receiving the holy ghost or not
[1:45:30] receiving the holy ghost
[1:45:31] because in the old testament if you'll
[1:45:33] notice that sacrifice that they had and
[1:45:35] they brought
[1:45:36] had to be without blemish and the
[1:45:38] sacrifice that you bring to god is god
[1:45:41] here i am i repent of all of my own
[1:45:43] ideas my own thoughts
[1:45:45] that sacrifice that you make has to be
[1:45:47] acceptable
[1:45:48] almighty god when he accepts your faith
[1:45:51] that i believe in you lord
[1:45:53] i give you my life amen he will confirm
[1:45:55] that he has accepted your faith
[1:45:58] that your engine has started hello and
[1:46:00] he will baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:46:02] and fire
[1:46:03] you can push that throttle down and say
[1:46:05] i'm not on that direction no more
[1:46:07] i'm heading towards life praise be to
[1:46:10] god
[1:46:12] and he comes and baptizes you and you
[1:46:14] get born again
[1:46:15] and i believe it was the scripture he
[1:46:17] says if
[1:46:19] if you then be risen in christ set your
[1:46:21] affections on things above
[1:46:23] and not on things below man for you
[1:46:26] are dead and your life is hid in christ
[1:46:29] through christ jesus
[1:46:31] i'm glad to have that your life is hid
[1:46:34] in christ when you get the baptism of
[1:46:37] the holy ghost
[1:46:39] i truly believe that's the only plan of
[1:46:41] salvation
[1:46:42] is through the cross of jesus christ
[1:46:44] through the remission of your sins comes
[1:46:46] amen remissions of sins comes
[1:46:50] by your repentance and your faith in the
[1:46:52] lord jesus christ
[1:46:53] and by giving him your all
[1:46:56] not part but every bit of yourself
[1:46:59] amen
[1:47:03] revelations the first chapter if you
[1:47:04] want to go with me
[1:47:06] there is amen
[1:47:11] repentance
[1:47:16] let's look at a couple more things on
[1:47:17] repentance
[1:47:20] revelations 2. revelations 2
[1:47:24] and we're talking about the first church
[1:47:26] age here
[1:47:28] which is the ephesian church which
[1:47:31] started
[1:47:32] 50 years after the day of pentecost
[1:47:37] isn't it something in it strange
[1:47:40] that time wasn't even recorded in that
[1:47:43] time frame
[1:47:46] it starts at 53 because it had the pure
[1:47:49] word of god
[1:47:51] undefiled the way it was supposed to be
[1:47:53] for a little while
[1:47:55] and then according to verse 5
[1:47:58] or verse 4 they've had patience they had
[1:48:02] labored
[1:48:02] they had not fainted nevertheless i have
[1:48:05] somewhat against thee
[1:48:07] because thou has left thy first
[1:48:10] love they went down into dark ages
[1:48:14] remember therefore from whence thou art
[1:48:16] fallen and repent
[1:48:19] amen and do the first works
[1:48:22] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[1:48:24] and remove a candlestick out of its
[1:48:26] place
[1:48:26] that first church they had simply gotten
[1:48:29] away from god and what did they have to
[1:48:32] do it talks about how that their fervent
[1:48:34] desire
[1:48:35] to please god amen not their desire to
[1:48:38] please the world or the neighbor
[1:48:39] but their desire to please god they love
[1:48:42] god with all of their heart mind
[1:48:44] soul and strength and that began to fade
[1:48:46] away
[1:48:49] i wonder how many sitting here this
[1:48:50] morning that could actually say
[1:48:52] you know there was a time in my life
[1:48:54] where i was a lot closer to god
[1:48:57] than i am now then what the spirit say
[1:49:01] to you the spirit tells you
[1:49:03] repent there's only one thing to do
[1:49:07] don't keep going the direction that
[1:49:08] you're going turn around
[1:49:11] do something different
[1:49:17] how many noses us older folks especially
[1:49:19] we get
[1:49:20] set in our ways we're like steel i mean
[1:49:22] that
[1:49:23] you know it's it's shaped and it's
[1:49:25] formed and then it hardens
[1:49:26] and when that still hardens it just
[1:49:29] stays right in that position
[1:49:30] that's how a lot of folks are we have
[1:49:33] habits we have ways that we do things
[1:49:35] and we never change them
[1:49:38] yet i believe the holy spirit speaks to
[1:49:40] us and he tells us hey you know you need
[1:49:42] to do that a little different than what
[1:49:44] you do
[1:49:44] you shouldn't be doing it that way
[1:49:48] huh
[1:49:52] this goes deep because i want to hear
[1:49:56] i'm here to tell you something
[1:49:57] that as we go into layout of cih over in
[1:50:00] the layout of ch the last church age
[1:50:03] which we'll go ahead and read the last
[1:50:04] church age which we are
[1:50:06] which is where we are unto the angel of
[1:50:08] the of laodiceans right he thinks saith
[1:50:10] the amen
[1:50:11] the faithful and true witness the
[1:50:12] beginning of the creation of god 3 and
[1:50:14] 14
[1:50:15] 15 now and i know that works at thou art
[1:50:18] neither cold nor hot
[1:50:20] i would thou art cold or hot how many
[1:50:24] believe the lord really loves to have a
[1:50:26] real close relationship with you he just
[1:50:29] doesn't like this mediocre
[1:50:31] relationship with us he wants you to be
[1:50:34] hot for god
[1:50:35] he wants you to be on fire for god
[1:50:38] amen but because thou art
[1:50:42] lukewarm and folks i'm here to tell you
[1:50:44] that's the age we're living in
[1:50:48] can i tell you what comes to my mind and
[1:50:50] heart of why we are
[1:50:59] because we used to be able to read our
[1:51:01] bibles isn't that right three four hours
[1:51:03] a day
[1:51:04] we used to i've heard of people being
[1:51:06] able to pray all night long
[1:51:10] just feasting on the word and i'll be
[1:51:13] absolutely honest
[1:51:16] i'm getting to where i love to read more
[1:51:18] and i like to study more
[1:51:19] and more and more and more because our
[1:51:22] minds are on the things of this world
[1:51:24] so much that's why we're in the
[1:51:28] condition
[1:51:28] because our minds are somewhere else the
[1:51:30] devil's got us so busy
[1:51:31] with everything else
[1:51:35] that we don't have time to really get
[1:51:37] down and fellowship with god
[1:51:39] fellowship with the holy spirit because
[1:51:42] you know
[1:51:42] that god did all of this for one reason
[1:51:45] and that is to have fellowship with you
[1:51:46] and me
[1:51:47] that's what he did it for so he can have
[1:51:49] fellowship with us
[1:51:51] and he desires to have fellowship with
[1:51:53] us on a daily basis
[1:51:56] but we're so concerned with the things
[1:51:58] of the world i'm too concerned with the
[1:52:00] things of the world to have a three-hour
[1:52:02] prayer time
[1:52:04] to have a 15 20 30 minutes almost
[1:52:07] how many would confess i i'm gonna have
[1:52:10] to repent
[1:52:11] i'm gonna have to take back time amen
[1:52:13] with my i want to get i got to get back
[1:52:15] to the place where i
[1:52:16] love to read the word i want to get back
[1:52:18] to the place that i read this bible and
[1:52:20] oh my i didn't see that before
[1:52:24] because how many knows that without the
[1:52:25] holy ghost this doesn't do a lot of good
[1:52:29] it takes the holy spirit in your heart
[1:52:30] to read this when it feeds on this
[1:52:32] because it's the only thing the holy
[1:52:34] spirit feeds on is the word of god
[1:52:36] amen you can't happen i just love this
[1:52:40] but the devil's got it tricked
[1:52:44] by stealing all our time
[1:52:48] and then when you find that the love
[1:52:50] that you once had for the lord isn't
[1:52:51] what it should be
[1:52:52] your walk with the lord isn't what it
[1:52:54] used to be
[1:52:59] amen
[1:53:02] not cold or hot but i because you're not
[1:53:05] been because you're lukewarm i'll spew
[1:53:07] thee
[1:53:08] out of my mouth what a horrible
[1:53:12] feeling what a terrible feeling when
[1:53:14] you've wandered so far away from god
[1:53:17] that you don't really even feel him
[1:53:19] anymore
[1:53:24] it's a horrible place to be
[1:53:27] the age which you are and i are living
[1:53:29] now
[1:53:30] is rich and increased with goods
[1:53:35] remember go over in revelations the 18th
[1:53:38] chapter
[1:53:39] and he talks about that woman where all
[1:53:42] the world is made
[1:53:43] rich through the abundance of her
[1:53:45] delicacies
[1:53:47] hello all her goods
[1:53:50] all these goods everything all the good
[1:53:53] little things that we have
[1:53:56] it's all owned by the devil
[1:54:01] all the things we listen to this we
[1:54:03] drive the best cars
[1:54:06] we wear the best clothes we eat the best
[1:54:09] food
[1:54:09] we live in the best places
[1:54:13] let me ask you this what about our
[1:54:15] spiritual prayer
[1:54:17] that's where we need to be rich
[1:54:23] what was it the prophet said he says you
[1:54:25] see we take a bath once a week
[1:54:27] and we'd pray every day and that right
[1:54:30] we was have decent shape
[1:54:32] we might have stunk a little bit on the
[1:54:34] outside but we were sweet and kind to
[1:54:37] each other and we waved to each other on
[1:54:39] the road
[1:54:40] we shake each other's sand we greet each
[1:54:42] other in the marketplace but now
[1:54:44] we take a bath twice a day and we got
[1:54:47] the biggest farm and we just walked
[1:54:48] right on by everybody
[1:54:50] don't pay attention to nobody huh
[1:54:53] we might stink on the inside and smell
[1:54:56] good on the outside
[1:54:57] i believe prayer changes things how many
[1:55:00] knows how many would say i need a closer
[1:55:02] walk with god and after this morning i
[1:55:05] am determined i'm going to repent and
[1:55:07] i'm going to ask god to help me
[1:55:08] turn change the direction that you're
[1:55:11] going you have to change something
[1:55:13] how many with me this morning you could
[1:55:15] look at your life and could
[1:55:16] honestly say lord not only do i need to
[1:55:19] but i promise you this morning
[1:55:21] to make some changes
[1:55:26] all you need to raise your hand remember
[1:55:28] do it don't just raise your hand
[1:55:29] do it make some changes because you'll
[1:55:32] never get different results if you keep
[1:55:33] doing the same thing over again
[1:55:36] amen that means you're crazy
[1:55:40] i don't want to preach no crazy people
[1:55:44] amen to work
[1:55:47] you know to think you're going to differ
[1:55:50] different results
[1:55:52] praise the lord how many know i just
[1:55:54] lord help us
[1:55:56] not only does the sinner need to repent
[1:55:57] not only does the world need to repent
[1:56:00] this message is still the gospel is
[1:56:03] still
[1:56:04] repent or perish to the world
[1:56:07] repent or perish before i don't say this
[1:56:11] let me go into another avenue for just a
[1:56:13] little bit because
[1:56:14] there was a voice that came out of
[1:56:16] heaven and screamed in revelations 18
[1:56:19] come out of her my people come out of
[1:56:21] denominational systems
[1:56:23] come out of man-made systems amen come
[1:56:26] and join yourself to meet
[1:56:28] the word of god i'll come and i'll prove
[1:56:31] myself alive like never before
[1:56:34] oh my so that you can know it's the
[1:56:37] truth but you've got to get out of those
[1:56:39] man-made systems
[1:56:40] because they're going over the fall
[1:56:42] they're not going to make the rapture
[1:56:45] let alone be in heaven when the truth is
[1:56:48] presented before you
[1:56:49] you turn it down you remember you
[1:56:51] separate yourself from god right there
[1:56:53] when you know something's the truth and
[1:56:55] you won't do it you separate yourself
[1:56:57] from god
[1:56:58] he knows your heart he'll play it back
[1:57:00] on the day of pen on the day of judgment
[1:57:03] amen so he has cried out to
[1:57:07] he says pentecost pentecost how god
[1:57:09] would have hovered you but you would not
[1:57:12] amen he says now you're dead
[1:57:16] he cried out to the churches in this
[1:57:18] generation repent turn around from the
[1:57:20] direction you're going
[1:57:22] you're your man-made systems they're
[1:57:24] just barnyards that's whole
[1:57:26] thing people but the egos come up higher
[1:57:28] come on up
[1:57:30] come out of the man-made system come out
[1:57:32] of something that thomas bottler
[1:57:34] might teach you that's contrary to the
[1:57:36] word come away from any other
[1:57:38] man that will teach you something that's
[1:57:39] contrary to the word
[1:57:41] because your very life depends on it
[1:57:43] jesus came in this generation he proved
[1:57:46] himself alive
[1:57:47] so much more than when he was here on
[1:57:48] earth amen he walked the shores of
[1:57:50] galilee
[1:57:51] world over 500
[1:57:54] 000 in india and africa challenged the
[1:57:57] buddha that seeks to change all of them
[1:57:59] says you come and open this blind man's
[1:58:00] eyes and i'll follow your religion but
[1:58:02] if the lord jesus christ will i proclaim
[1:58:05] and say that he's not dead but he is
[1:58:07] alive and he's here
[1:58:08] and he's proven himself he'll heal up in
[1:58:10] his eyes will you accept the lord as
[1:58:12] your savior
[1:58:15] amen let me tell you and upon that
[1:58:19] the world will burn that rejects it
[1:58:23] and does not believe the lord jesus
[1:58:25] christ
[1:58:26] you don't believe what jesus did in
[1:58:28] disgeneration you do not believe jesus
[1:58:32] amen because remember whatever you do
[1:58:34] with jesus today
[1:58:36] is what you'd have done it with him back
[1:58:38] then
[1:58:39] amen how many believes the church world
[1:58:42] needs
[1:58:43] to repent america needs to repent
[1:58:47] but they're not gonna prophet already
[1:58:49] proclaimed
[1:58:50] that she won't repent there's only one
[1:58:53] thing left for her and that is fire
[1:58:55] she's gonna burn amen but there's still
[1:58:58] individuals in churches
[1:59:00] god's children are still in those
[1:59:02] churches that god is still calling to
[1:59:04] come out
[1:59:06] come out and meet me at midnight there
[1:59:08] was a cry given
[1:59:10] come me out to meet the bridegroom come
[1:59:13] out of denominational systems come out
[1:59:15] my man made things
[1:59:16] repent amen
[1:59:20] notice he's talking to the church
[1:59:24] they're rich they're increased with
[1:59:26] goods and they don't think
[1:59:27] that they need anything they're in good
[1:59:30] shape
[1:59:31] they feel like they're okay
[1:59:35] um
[1:59:38] notice it says that they're wretched if
[1:59:41] verse 17
[1:59:42] follow me and i'm skipping a few words
[1:59:44] because i'm
[1:59:45] bringing in on the back part of this
[1:59:48] they're wretched
[1:59:49] they're miserable they're poor and
[1:59:51] they're blind
[1:59:53] now back to the beginning of that and it
[1:59:55] says
[1:59:56] and knowest not
[1:59:59] that thou art wretched miserable poor
[2:00:03] blind and naked
[2:00:07] imagine a person out there miserable
[2:00:11] blind walking around in the streets
[2:00:14] naked
[2:00:16] wretched miserable poor dirty filthy
[2:00:22] just miserable just horrible naked
[2:00:26] and you go up and tell him hey don't you
[2:00:28] know you don't have any clothes on
[2:00:32] no don't leave me alone my church don't
[2:00:35] teach that
[2:00:37] huh i'm fine
[2:00:41] it says they don't know it they don't
[2:00:44] even know their
[2:00:45] condition that's the worst part is that
[2:00:47] they don't even realize it
[2:00:50] how many knows many are going to go into
[2:00:51] the tribulation period
[2:00:53] and our government and all governments
[2:00:55] of the world
[2:00:56] they're propelling this one world
[2:00:59] government
[2:00:59] you can believe that and it'll soon come
[2:01:02] to where
[2:01:03] the bribe will be pushed out hello the
[2:01:06] tribulation will be sitting there
[2:01:07] there'll be a
[2:01:08] lot of people that'll go into that
[2:01:10] tribulation period
[2:01:12] thinking that they wouldn't be there
[2:01:16] but you and i can't take a chance as
[2:01:18] christians i don't want to take no
[2:01:20] chance say god search my heart
[2:01:23] i preached a message here the other week
[2:01:24] and talking about how that we have got
[2:01:26] to search our soul
[2:01:28] all the way down to the inner world let
[2:01:30] the holy spirit come and search your
[2:01:32] soul
[2:01:32] and see if there's any ways in there
[2:01:34] that are unlike god
[2:01:38] because we were so prone to deceiving
[2:01:41] ourselves
[2:01:42] it's easy to deceive yourself
[2:01:45] make you think you're okay when you're
[2:01:47] not these people deceive themselves
[2:01:50] why because they thought they were okay
[2:01:54] they thought they were rich they were
[2:01:55] increased youth good god's blessed me
[2:01:56] with a great business god bless me with
[2:01:58] that god bless me with this that or the
[2:02:00] other
[2:02:02] and let me tell you something i got to
[2:02:03] go a little further can you hang in with
[2:02:05] me this morning

[2:02:13] to be here
[2:02:14] this is what i'm preaching i didn't know
[2:02:16] what i was going to preach until during
[2:02:18] the night last night
[2:02:20] i said lord i don't know what you want
[2:02:21] me to preach but i've always just relied
[2:02:22] on you
[2:02:23] that's where he brought this this simple
[2:02:26] thought
[2:02:28] that we need to repent god is calling
[2:02:32] and he's trying to do let me tell you
[2:02:34] god is trying to
[2:02:36] do a detailed work on his people because
[2:02:39] we're fixing to get out of here folks
[2:02:41] jesus is fixing to come and he is coming
[2:02:44] down into every one of our lives
[2:02:46] and to ask us are you really in love
[2:02:49] with god
[2:02:49] like you should be
[2:02:54] how many wants to know if you're really
[2:02:55] in love with god
[2:02:57] this is my next my next part before we
[2:03:00] go into the baptism
[2:03:04] turn to saint john with me a couple
[2:03:06] scriptures
[2:03:08] that gear us and tell us whether we're
[2:03:10] really in love with god like we should
[2:03:12] be
[2:03:13] and what god tells us that we're going
[2:03:15] to do
[2:03:16] if you really love him
[2:03:20] because people think that they can do
[2:03:21] whatever they want to do
[2:03:23] and still call themselves christians
[2:03:25] believe what you want to believe no you
[2:03:27] better come god's way
[2:03:30] because it's like jesus said the wise
[2:03:32] man built his house upon a rock
[2:03:34] and he talks about the wise man that
[2:03:36] builds his house upon the rock is the
[2:03:38] guy that
[2:03:39] actually doeth the will of god
[2:03:42] not his own will but does god's will
[2:03:47] obeys what god said do
[2:03:52] saint john 14 and 13 14-13 let me see
[2:03:55] where we're at
[2:03:58] now i want you to understand this this
[2:04:00] is also going to be an answer to your
[2:04:02] question of why
[2:04:03] god don't answer your prayers
[2:04:08] has anybody ever had wondered lord why
[2:04:10] don't you answer my prayers
[2:04:13] lord it seems like i asked this but i
[2:04:14] didn't get it
[2:04:16] i i have you you know y'all are holier
[2:04:18] than i am then this morning if you don't
[2:04:19] have that
[2:04:20] lord i i've asked that it didn't seem
[2:04:21] like i got it lord what did i do wrong
[2:04:23] where did i miss it
[2:04:25] sure because i don't know about you but
[2:04:28] i'd like for the lord to answer my
[2:04:30] prayers i don't want to ask him this
[2:04:33] so he starts with verse 13
[2:04:37] whatsoever you ask in my name that will
[2:04:40] i do
[2:04:41] that the father may be glorified in the
[2:04:43] son how many knows god really wants to
[2:04:44] work miracles among us
[2:04:46] because it only does one thing in that
[2:04:48] it really brings honor and glory to the
[2:04:50] name of jesus christ
[2:04:51] sure it does so ask anything in my name
[2:04:55] and i will do it
[2:04:56] and then he says but if you love me
[2:05:00] keep my commandments
[2:05:05] last week in different places i heard
[2:05:06] brother says you know abraham he went
[2:05:08] out there and he didn't
[2:05:09] leave his father and my brother you know
[2:05:12] at home and like he was told to do
[2:05:14] and he never really was fully blessed
[2:05:16] until he fully obeyed god
[2:05:18] he makes a statement i truly believe
[2:05:20] it's true you'll never
[2:05:22] really be fully blessed until you fully
[2:05:25] obey god what he said do
[2:05:28] and you can't really say that you love
[2:05:30] him properly
[2:05:32] unless you do what god said there
[2:05:35] and i'll tell you what
[2:05:39] okay so there's one scripture if you
[2:05:42] love me
[2:05:43] keep my commandments
[2:05:48] saint john 13 34
[2:05:55] he also says
[2:05:58] a new commandment i give you that ye
[2:06:00] love
[2:06:01] one another amen how many believes that
[2:06:04] if you truly love god
[2:06:05] that you'll love one another you'll love
[2:06:08] people
[2:06:09] people are the hardest things to love
[2:06:12] they really are
[2:06:13] and it takes the holy ghost for you to
[2:06:14] love somebody that's going to smack you
[2:06:16] on the cheek
[2:06:17] we are so full of mistakes in that right
[2:06:19] every one of us even as friends
[2:06:21] amongst friends a lot of times we hurt
[2:06:23] each other
[2:06:24] but you got to love enough to forgive
[2:06:27] love enough to say i'm sorry huh we're
[2:06:30] complicated but yet he says
[2:06:31] do the hardest thing there is to do and
[2:06:33] love one another
[2:06:34] and he can only do that by the holy
[2:06:36] ghost as i have loved you love one
[2:06:39] another
[2:06:40] by this shall all men know that you are
[2:06:42] my disciples if you have love
[2:06:44] one for another there's another way
[2:06:47] let's look at another one in first john
[2:06:49] i believe it is way back in first john
[2:06:52] my my my i'm rushing here and we're
[2:06:55] going to leave off some potatoes and
[2:06:57] beans that we could be eating on so
[2:06:59] anyway i may pick it up if the holy
[2:07:01] spirit keeps me in mind
[2:07:03] okay because i want to go back to
[2:07:05] revelations just as a finale
[2:07:07] during revelations about that church age
[2:07:11] um in first john three there's many
[2:07:14] scriptures here
[2:07:15] that's really good also first john three
[2:07:20] actually let's start with chapter two
[2:07:22] first john
[2:07:24] in verse 3. hereby know we that we know
[2:07:27] him how many wants to know that you know
[2:07:29] i know that i know it
[2:07:30] all right hereby know that we know him
[2:07:34] if we keep his commandments
[2:07:38] he did say it i know him and keepeth not
[2:07:40] his commandments
[2:07:41] is it what that's right
[2:07:45] they're a liar because anybody that
[2:07:48] really loves the lord
[2:07:49] wants to do what he tells you to do how
[2:07:52] many believes that
[2:07:54] and the truth is not even in him
[2:07:58] how many knows that when you have the
[2:08:00] love of god in your heart you got the
[2:08:01] holy ghost
[2:08:02] you love church you love to assemble
[2:08:04] yourselves together
[2:08:07] you love to praise the lord give him
[2:08:09] honor and glory
[2:08:11] you'd love to come down and come 30
[2:08:13] minutes early and get on your knees and
[2:08:15] say god if i've done anything wrong lord
[2:08:17] forgive me lord and anoint the preacher
[2:08:20] to say and
[2:08:21] say what i have need of hearing
[2:08:24] let me ask you this if god spoke to you
[2:08:26] this morning do you feel like that
[2:08:28] request was honored that god will
[2:08:30] actually speak to hearts if we're just
[2:08:31] listen
[2:08:34] amen
[2:08:38] all right that's right and the truth is
[2:08:40] not him over another another scripture
[2:08:42] in 3
[2:08:43] 21 will begin
[2:08:48] actually you know when it comes to
[2:08:51] ask what you will but keep my
[2:08:53] commandments you'll find it in chapter 3
[2:08:54] verse
[2:08:55] 21. yeah beloved if our heart condemn us
[2:08:58] not be confidence towards god
[2:09:00] how many believe you really need to
[2:09:01] search your heart make sure that you can
[2:09:03] have confidence
[2:09:04] towards god and whatsoever we ask we
[2:09:06] receive of him because we keep his
[2:09:07] commandments
[2:09:08] and do those things that are pleasing in
[2:09:12] his
[2:09:12] sight how many knows enoch was trained
[2:09:15] translated the bible says and enoch was
[2:09:17] not
[2:09:18] amen for he walked with god and he had
[2:09:21] this testimony
[2:09:25] and that is that he plea
[2:09:28] your pastor this morning is to say if
[2:09:30] you're not walking
[2:09:32] every day with him like you should god
[2:09:35] give you that walk with god
[2:09:38] and may everything you do be pleasing
[2:09:42] to god i believe when you walk like that
[2:09:44] i believe that's what you can ask
[2:09:47] and god will honor what you ask for
[2:09:51] amen in closing
[2:09:55] i want to cap it off with revelations
[2:09:58] the third chapter of the layout
[2:10:00] of ci age i didn't quite finish that
[2:10:05] they're miserable poor blind and naked
[2:10:07] in verse 18 he says i counsel thee the
[2:10:09] buy of me gold
[2:10:10] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[2:10:13] rich
[2:10:14] and white raiment how many knows that
[2:10:16] white raiment
[2:10:18] is only one thing and that is when the
[2:10:21] holy spirit comes into your heart
[2:10:23] he forgives you of all of your sins and
[2:10:25] the very life that was in jesus comes
[2:10:27] into your heart
[2:10:28] that's the only righteousness that we
[2:10:30] have that thou mayest be clothed and
[2:10:33] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[2:10:35] appear
[2:10:36] and anoint the eyes with thyself that
[2:10:38] you can actually see
[2:10:39] the condition that you're in how many
[2:10:42] believes it's a blessing
[2:10:43] when god shows you that you're not what
[2:10:46] you ought to be
[2:10:47] thank you lord for showing me where i'm
[2:10:49] not where i ought to be because
[2:10:51] man i could have just went right on
[2:10:52] there and be lost but he shows you
[2:10:55] where you're not where you ought to be
[2:10:56] he gives you eyes have to be able to see
[2:10:58] it
[2:10:59] and then after he says all of this
[2:11:04] gives them all their conditions and so
[2:11:06] forth he says now as many as i love
[2:11:10] i rebuke and chasten
[2:11:14] amen somebody said about the prophet of
[2:11:18] god he says why are you always rebuking
[2:11:20] people and
[2:11:21] and hammering on this and hammering on
[2:11:23] that why are you always doing that
[2:11:24] this is why because love is corrective
[2:11:30] love is corrective if the lord loves you
[2:11:34] he's going to rebuke you
[2:11:36] when you feel like ah preacher's
[2:11:38] stepping on my well that's good
[2:11:40] thank the lord somebody cares about you
[2:11:43] otherwise i say it doesn't matter how
[2:11:45] y'all live just believe the lord jesus
[2:11:46] christ you'll be saved
[2:11:49] huh throw me out of my head brother
[2:11:52] steve
[2:11:53] it's a lie don't just do how you want
[2:11:56] just say you believe no
[2:11:57] live for the lord with all your heart
[2:11:59] amen as many as i love i rebuke and
[2:12:02] chasten
[2:12:03] be zealous therefore
[2:12:06] be diligent be zealous and say it with
[2:12:09] me
[2:12:10] repent be zealous and repent
[2:12:14] say god help me the seal listen
[2:12:18] the zeal to serve god in this hour is
[2:12:20] for you
[2:12:21] to turn around from any way that is
[2:12:24] unlike god
[2:12:25] and that is displeasing to god
[2:12:29] amen praise the lord
[2:12:32] we're thankful that god still touches
[2:12:33] hearts like
[2:12:35] sister donna back there that wants to
[2:12:36] give her heart to the lord wants to be
[2:12:38] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[2:12:40] christ
[2:12:41] want to give her her all amen but you
[2:12:44] know we're going to baptize her in the
[2:12:45] name of the lord jesus christ
[2:12:47] but what about before we do that let's
[2:12:49] talk about just
[2:12:50] what about the rest of us that just
[2:12:51] really need a closer walk and realize
[2:12:53] i have some things i need to repent of
[2:12:56] i need to turn around from some of my
[2:12:58] ways
[2:12:59] when i hear of uh church's message
[2:13:02] churches folks that have not had any
[2:13:05] services hardly at all
[2:13:07] since last march for over a year message
[2:13:09] church is closing up
[2:13:11] who'd have thought i thought only
[2:13:12] denominational churches close up because
[2:13:14] there's not really anything coming
[2:13:15] anymore
[2:13:19] huh let me tell you when that happens he
[2:13:22] better come back quick
[2:13:24] or there won't be any faith left upon
[2:13:25] the earth
[2:13:27] somebody don't love the lord like they
[2:13:28] ought to
[2:13:30] that's right i don't know about you but
[2:13:31] i'd find me a church somewhere to go to
[2:13:35] i want everybody to know i love the lord
[2:13:37] isn't that right
[2:13:40] because you've got the holy ghost
[2:13:41] brother brahm says you can't wait for
[2:13:43] them doors to open
[2:13:44] he said you can't they can't chain you
[2:13:46] out of the door you're gonna be there
[2:13:48] i want my brother's sister so no i love
[2:13:50] the lord
[2:13:53] huh you don't come for a month of
[2:13:57] sundays and so forth
[2:13:58] don't try to tell me you love the lord
[2:14:02] your action shows you don't
[2:14:08] because if you i love the lord you're
[2:14:10] going to love your brothers and sisters
[2:14:11] you're going to be doing everything for
[2:14:13] the kingdom of god that you can
[2:14:14] because i'm here to tell you this world
[2:14:16] and the goods of this world it's all
[2:14:17] going to pass away it isn't going to
[2:14:19] matter
[2:14:21] it's only what you have done for christ
[2:14:22] the way you have lived for him that's
[2:14:23] going to make a difference
[2:14:25] you love him i know your hearts and i
[2:14:28] was
[2:14:29] kind of burdened but listen the holy
[2:14:30] spirit i would just want god to keep
[2:14:32] speaking to our heart
[2:14:33] are you all up there in the balcony is
[2:14:35] that good for you y'all enjoy the holy
[2:14:36] spirit speaking to you
[2:14:38] how many just wants a closer walk with
[2:14:40] god how many will say lord
[2:14:42] search my heart of god see if there be
[2:14:44] any wicked way in me lord
[2:14:47] how can i get closer to you lord how can
[2:14:50] i empty out more
[2:14:51] how can i repent more so that more of
[2:14:54] you can be in me lord
[2:14:55] show me and then when i go about monday
[2:14:58] guess what where i used to just get up
[2:15:00] and i wouldn't pray or read my
[2:15:01] i'm going to start reading my bible when
[2:15:03] i come home from work i'm going to make
[2:15:05] it my
[2:15:05] my my main love of my life is going to
[2:15:08] be to read god's word
[2:15:09] to pray and to have a fellowship with
[2:15:11] him rather than worrying so much about
[2:15:13] my job
[2:15:15] i'm going to make some changes in my
[2:15:16] life
[2:15:18] amen can i just say what comes to mind
[2:15:24] dog business we have a little dog
[2:15:26] business and it's so easy to
[2:15:27] you know people say hey can i meet you
[2:15:29] on sunday

[2:15:33] probably
[2:15:34] can i meet you sunday morning or sunday
[2:15:36] afternoon decided i'm so sorry you'll
[2:15:38] have to come on monday or something
[2:15:39] i know you gotta you gotta schedule
[2:15:41] around you gotta say god here

[2:15:59] church has need of
[2:16:01] and people aren't there and they'll
[2:16:03] never hear it
[2:16:05] and he'll grow on in darkness amen
[2:16:09] i believe it's important folks that we
[2:16:11] as christians
[2:16:12] we have need to repent to
[2:16:16] amen repentance because that's how you
[2:16:18] get the remission of your sins
[2:16:21] that's how you change let the fire of
[2:16:23] the holy ghost
[2:16:26] ah i can't hardly quit but you know the
[2:16:29] only way that you can take that steel
[2:16:30] that's been
[2:16:31] molded and that's hard the only thing
[2:16:34] that'll
[2:16:34] reshape that steel those ways that you
[2:16:37] have that just don't change
[2:16:39] that need to be changed it's the
[2:16:41] sweetness and the fire
[2:16:43] of god to come down and soften you up
[2:16:46] make you soft for god say god i didn't
[2:16:49] realize i was that way but i am lord
[2:16:53] lord reshape me mold me change me lord
[2:16:58] amen
[2:17:01] me and my son were coming back from
[2:17:03] missouri
[2:17:04] the other day and we went to buy a
[2:17:07] little dog
[2:17:12] oh my about waiting to buy a little dog
[2:17:15] for caleb and
[2:17:16] we got over there brother steve and we
[2:17:18] ended up coming back with five
[2:17:21] all right but anyway i was we went five
[2:17:25] hours one way and i
[2:17:26] told the lady i said see you got any
[2:17:28] others that you might sell might be
[2:17:29] ready to go he said well i got these two
[2:17:31] mamas that are ready to go you know and
[2:17:34] you know how it is they've gone you got
[2:17:35] a mama
[2:17:36] and it was a real cheap prize i said
[2:17:38] yeah we'll take them also you know and
[2:17:40] we got over there i changed my mind
[2:17:41] about the one and so forth but anyway we
[2:17:43] ended up finding four
[2:17:44] met all four and we was heading back and
[2:17:46] it was snowing
[2:17:48] the worlds were white almost dark
[2:17:51] before we were even leaving west plains
[2:17:53] coming back
[2:17:54] and as we were going down the highway we
[2:17:57] looked
[2:17:58] i looked on the side of the road and
[2:17:59] there was a little dog a beagle dog
[2:18:02] and i knew something was bad wrong he
[2:18:04] had his back end laid down he had just
[2:18:06] his front end up like that almost
[2:18:08] he was standing beside in a nice swale
[2:18:10] ditch over there beside the highway
[2:18:14] and i said there's a dog he's hurt he's
[2:18:16] got to be hurt
[2:18:18] he wouldn't just be in that snow he'll
[2:18:19] freeze to death
[2:18:21] caleb says go on dad don't you stop
[2:18:27] let him die he ain't your problem though
[2:18:29] i says no way
[2:18:30] i said i can't do it i can't see a
[2:18:33] beagle there's in the snow
[2:18:34] freezing to death and not having
[2:18:37] compassion
[2:18:38] not having enough love to stop for him
[2:18:41] and so he stopped
[2:18:46] and he had gotten hit poor thing showed
[2:18:48] in the snow kind of where he had
[2:18:50] breakfast back in or whatever and
[2:18:52] he was over there and he let me come
[2:18:53] over there talk to him and pick him up
[2:18:54] and i looked at the back leg and
[2:18:57] right where his foot goes out like be
[2:18:58] our ankle i guess he was just straight
[2:19:00] sideways
[2:19:01] i kind of picked it up and it was just
[2:19:02] felt pretty bad
[2:19:04] but you know we put him in the back of
[2:19:05] the truck we still had room in the back
[2:19:09] yeah we still had room that's why i said
[2:19:10] five not this four
[2:19:13] but you know you would normally think
[2:19:15] just let it go you know but
[2:19:18] i believe it's the holy spirit god in
[2:19:20] your heart just doesn't matter what it
[2:19:21] is
[2:19:22] you have compassion you have love i mean
[2:19:25] how many
[2:19:26] beliefs you really want to be soft we
[2:19:27] want to be have that tenderness about
[2:19:30] our hearts
[2:19:31] so anyway we ended up bringing him home
[2:19:33] because the owner
[2:19:34] of the of the he had a tag and a phone
[2:19:36] number he says man i haven't seen that
[2:19:38] dog for seven you haven't had any for
[2:19:39] seven years and
[2:19:41] no idea who's he was and what it was but
[2:19:43] he needed help so
[2:19:44] we brought him back and so he's at the
[2:19:46] vet now we prayed for him the vet says
[2:19:48] look his
[2:19:49] leg is broke so bad it's sideways
[2:19:51] completely sideways attendants are
[2:19:53] probably torn
[2:19:54] best thing for me to do is come all the
[2:19:56] way up and cut the whole leg off
[2:19:58] i says i can't do that doc
[2:20:02] i says i may have to put him down i
[2:20:04] don't know but i'm trusting the lord and
[2:20:05] i'm just giving the lord a chance to
[2:20:06] heal him
[2:20:07] and i believe it can be done don't you
[2:20:10] and i said let's put a splint on it he
[2:20:11] says give me a few days and he knew it
[2:20:13] was a charity thing and he saw
[2:20:15] yeah you know he said he's gonna have it
[2:20:17] a few days for maybe
[2:20:19] i know what he's i know the doctor and i
[2:20:21] know he's gonna go in there and do
[2:20:22] whatever he can to try to
[2:20:23] help help that poor thing because
[2:20:25] whether or not that egg really works
[2:20:27] right
[2:20:27] good or not probably determine his
[2:20:29] future so but i'm just praying you know
[2:20:31] it'll all have
[2:20:32] mercy on him amen but just to see
[2:20:34] something like that then i see
[2:20:35] think about the world think about people
[2:20:37] that are not saved and they don't know
[2:20:39] what it's like to walk with the lord
[2:20:40] they don't know what it's like to be
[2:20:42] born again at 20
[2:20:44] years old like i was in a 59 to love him
[2:20:47] more than ever
[2:20:48] and still want a closer walk and and
[2:20:50] people out there
[2:20:52] you know we had a friend of ours that we
[2:20:55] grew up with
[2:20:55] i guess caleb and the different ones
[2:20:57] they knew him pretty good chester the
[2:20:58] young man about 24 years old
[2:21:00] amen and he had tattoos everywhere and
[2:21:03] and he was in nashville and
[2:21:05] he went was crossing the road of
[2:21:07] somebody we knew well
[2:21:08] you remember chester money have you
[2:21:10] heard about chester
[2:21:12] that he actually passed away but he was
[2:21:14] going across him he got hit by a car you
[2:21:15] know and
[2:21:16] he was on life support i guess and his
[2:21:18] neck broke but
[2:21:19] you know he didn't make it i was like
[2:21:22] you think about where he might be
[2:21:23] you know if he wasn't right with the
[2:21:25] lord at that young of age
[2:21:28] you know where we know that when you
[2:21:30] pass over there's no more
[2:21:32] no more trying that anymore this is the
[2:21:34] hour this is the time
[2:21:36] to be ready and to make ready amen and
[2:21:38] you feel so bad say lord jesus i sure
[2:21:41] hope somehow or other he made things
[2:21:42] right before he passed away but
[2:21:44] it was certainly a certain sudden thing
[2:21:47] but listen of all the times and all the
[2:21:50] ages that has come
[2:21:51] and gone by here you and i are this is
[2:21:54] our time

[2:22:43] feel that there is a change that needs
[2:22:45] to be made in their life
[2:22:47] to make more room for you to need to
[2:22:49] repent of perhaps
[2:22:51] simple thing as time lord being taken
[2:22:53] away from them
[2:22:54] to where they don't have that
[2:22:55] relationship with you like they should

[2:23:05] what we should fathom we ask god that
[2:23:07] you give us a deeper love for you father
[2:23:09] a greater dedication and we repent lord
[2:23:11] jesus of all of our wrong this morning
[2:23:14] and ask god that you'll saturate our
[2:23:15] heart our soul
[2:23:18] our families and our children how they
[2:23:20] would feel the presence of god
[2:23:22] lord upon moms and upon dads and they
[2:23:24] would say dad i want what you got mom i
[2:23:26] want what you got
[2:23:28] whatever it is that you got i want it
[2:23:30] maybe be that
[2:23:31] salty father to our neighbors and to
[2:23:32] those who work for us or
[2:23:34] who those who are around us lord we ask
[2:23:37] god that you'll just bless each and

[2:23:54] now we ask you a blessed our sister
[2:23:56] and she gives her heart to you lord
[2:23:57] jesus and that you'll baptize baptizer
[2:23:59] with the baptism of the holy ghost as
