========================================

And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. Period. 2,000 years go by in this verse. Is that right? And the heart of the children, which is us, the fathers was the Israelites. They were the fathers supposed to come to the children. Yeah. Now we're come to a place where Amen. the children's hearts have to be turned back to the fathers. Woo. Amen. They just say, "Well, God done it. He did it. That's right. I'm a part of the fulfillment of this scripture. That's why he sent Elijah. That's why the prophet came to make you and to bring your heart, to bring your faith, to bring your life, to bring everything about you back the way they were back on the day of Pentecost, completely restored, back to the fullness of the word. I mean, it's a restoration message. If there's a prophecy that all that the canker worm is eating, all the caterpillar and all the locust, but he said, "I will restore," sayaith the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Not some day going by, what's going on? What's the matter with them people? I'll tell you what's the matter with me. I've been restored. [Music] That's why we believe in there's one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father who is above all and in you all and all through you all. Like Paul said, there by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. Restored back to what the Paul said, the way that Paul taught it.
