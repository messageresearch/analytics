[9:23] morning brothers and sisters
[9:27] or just staying this morning
[9:32] maybe brother John Wade will open us in
[9:34] prayer this morning
[9:55] well again
[10:34] look at me
[10:36] and other things
[10:49] amen the children can be dismissed for
[10:51] Sunday school and if you're going the
[10:53] songs for me to Psalms 119.
[10:56] I'm gonna read
[10:59] a little bit out of Psalms 119 here
[11:07] we're gonna start in verse 17 and we'll
[11:10] read to verse 32 there
[11:15] the old Bountiful with thy servant that
[11:18] I may live and keep thy word
[11:21] eyes
[11:27] I'm a stranger in the earth hide not thy
[11:30] Commandments from me
[11:37] God has tribute the proud that are
[11:40] cursed which do air from thy
[11:42] Commandments
[11:43] go forward
[11:49] princess also didn't sit and speak
[11:51] against me but thy servant did meditate
[11:53] in thy statutes
[12:00] I sold cleaveeth unto the dust quickened
[12:03] thou me according to Thy Word
[12:12] make me to understand the way of thy
[12:15] precept so shall I talk to thy one of
[12:17] thy wondrous works
[12:25] remove from me the way of lying and
[12:29] Grant me thy law
[12:31] graciously
[12:37] I am stuck unto thy testimonies O Lord
[12:40] put me not to shame
[12:42] I will ruin the way of thy Commandments
[12:46] when thou shalt enlarge my heart God
[12:48] bless you may be seated brother Brian
[12:58] foreign
[13:01] brothers and sisters
[13:05] no I was that those first couple of
[13:08] words as we were reading in 17 I was
[13:10] thinking my mind
[13:12] if you want to another Psalm that goes
[13:14] to the from the 17th to the 24th you
[13:17] would go back to the first psalm
[13:19] kind of hits the same subjects again I
[13:22] was
[13:23] that quote up there this morning from uh
[13:25] Thursday
[13:27] yeah that's where we have to be at this
[13:30] morning that no matter who we are or
[13:32] what we where we're at
[13:35] to put the word of God first and not be
[13:38] afraid of what people might say about
[13:40] you no I was just thinking there which
[13:43] can be a dangerous thing I'm going to
[13:45] say I was thinking this world we live in
[13:47] everybody's running after the shiny
[13:49] thing now you're not satisfied in their
[13:51] hearts not satisfied in their lives
[13:53] they're just running after every shiny
[13:55] thing that's thrown before them but it
[13:57] should be that way for a Christian the
[13:59] only thing a Christian's concerned about
[14:01] is where he is in the word of God at
[14:04] that any given time and you have an
[14:07] answer in the word of God you don't have
[14:09] to run after all those shiny things you
[14:11] see out in the world and as I see the
[14:13] years go by I see that Satan and the
[14:16] world just keeps putting more shiny
[14:18] things out there for people to run after
[14:21] not that some of the things that we do
[14:23] in the world are bad it's just they God
[14:26] wants you to be totally focused on him
[14:30] he doesn't want you running after every
[14:31] little thing out there in the world and
[14:34] some times we forget we have and I was
[14:36] as we're reading the Psalms I was
[14:38] thinking about David
[14:39] and some of the other people that wrote
[14:41] These Psalms they knew the word of God
[14:44] but they were humble before the word of
[14:46] God David is always saying I need to
[14:48] learn more there's more that God can
[14:50] give me there's more that I need to know
[14:52] I'm not complete I'm always learning and
[14:56] striving to be better than what I was
[14:58] the day before in the scriptures but if
[15:01] you would go with me to uh
[15:04] Corinthian uh no Galatians this second
[15:07] chapter
[15:10] before I get started uh I mentioned last
[15:13] week
[15:14] that the two things left to do for the
[15:17] church the finish the year
[15:18] money wise other than any emergencies
[15:21] I've taken care of the
[15:24] pre prepaid for the year I prepaid
[15:27] another 1500 gallons of fuel that bring
[15:30] us into the new year and uh that's
[15:33] enough to get us
[15:36] that's enough to get us probably to
[15:38] February or March and I got the
[15:40] insurance for the uh upcoming year in uh
[15:44] yesterday in the mail and I was a little
[15:47] concerned because we did make a claim
[15:48] this year but Lord blessed us our
[15:51] insurance payment for the year this year
[15:54] is the same as it was last year so it
[15:56] didn't change making that claim didn't
[15:58] change the amount of insurance we have
[16:01] to make so I paid 3 600 I had to pay for
[16:04] the summer Phil
[16:06] uh which was right around thirty six
[16:09] hundred dollars and change that include
[16:11] what they put in in August and that's
[16:13] paying for 1500 gallons that was thirty
[16:16] six hundred dollars and change
[16:18] and the insurance for the next coming
[16:20] year is uh about 3 800 so that's uh and
[16:26] we have more than enough money in the
[16:28] general fund to cover that without
[16:30] hurting the general fund so I thought
[16:32] I'd let you know but going to this
[16:34] jumping
[16:36] to the second chapter of Colossians here
[16:39] you know I was thinking this morning in
[16:41] that that quote keeps coming up
[16:43] thirsting for the word of God and
[16:45] everything that we do and I'll just read
[16:48] in a in cautions the second chapter and
[16:51] in First Peter the first chapter
[16:53] uh
[16:54] Peter and Paul are saying pretty much
[16:56] saying the same thing each started the
[16:59] ministry but I'll just read what this
[17:01] has to say
[17:03] uh this morning or wood that you would
[17:05] know with great conflict that I have for
[17:08] you and for them at lateral Seer for as
[17:11] many as have not seen my face in the
[17:13] flesh so Paul Paul saying he knows what
[17:16] he's writing here not everyone will ever
[17:18] hear Paul speak well you know never see
[17:21] Paul but he's writing things in this
[17:23] epistle that'll go for generations to
[17:26] come and he's setting everything in
[17:28] order here and he goes my face that
[17:32] their hearts might be come from being
[17:34] knit together and love onto all the
[17:36] riches of the full assurance
[17:38] of the understanding to the
[17:42] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[17:44] of the father and of Christ and this
[17:46] goes about what brother Branham taught
[17:48] us about the godhead and then he goes on
[17:50] to say in whom are HID all the treasures
[17:52] and wisdom and knowledge but you all
[17:54] have a you guys are all of us are pretty
[17:57] lucky this morning we have a message for
[18:00] the hour that you have the reveal a word
[18:02] that you can look at the scriptures and
[18:04] you know where you stand in the word of
[18:06] God this morning
[18:07] and he goes on to saying humor hid all
[18:10] the treasures and wisdoms and knowledge
[18:12] and this I say at least any man should
[18:14] beguile you with enticing words and that
[18:16] goes back to what I was saying earlier
[18:18] the world is full of shiny things and
[18:20] those shiny things are to beguile you
[18:22] and they take you away from the word of
[18:24] God this morning and he goes on to say
[18:27] for though I am absent in the flesh yet
[18:29] I am with you in the spirit joining and
[18:31] beholding your order and you said your
[18:34] faith in Christ
[18:37] as you have therefore received Christ
[18:39] Jesus as the Lord so walk ye in him and
[18:42] that's the same for us this morning as
[18:44] God Reveals His word to you this morning
[18:46] as he reveals the message of the hour
[18:49] this morning you're obligated to walk in
[18:51] yet I know that sounds legalistic I
[18:53] don't mean it that way as God gives you
[18:55] more truth it gives you more presence of
[18:57] his spirit in your life more is going to
[18:59] be required of you as you walk and he
[19:01] goes on to say booted and built up in
[19:04] him the steps in faith as you have been
[19:05] taught abounding therein for
[19:07] Thanksgiving
[19:09] beware at least any man spoil through
[19:12] philosophy vain deceit after traditions
[19:15] of men after the removing itself the
[19:17] world and not after Christ that goes
[19:19] what I was saying about them shiny
[19:21] things you know you've got to be careful
[19:24] with what you're listening to and what
[19:27] you put your heart in sometimes it can
[19:29] be the wrong thing for all all for in
[19:32] him dwell with all the fullness of the
[19:34] godhead bodily and you are complete in
[19:37] him which is the head of all Prince
[19:39] priorities and Powers so there's nothing
[19:42] out there in the world that's going to
[19:44] make you any better but this word of God
[19:46] and his Spirit In Your Heart life is
[19:48] going to make you better that's the only
[19:50] thing that's going to make you better in
[19:52] whom you also are circumcised with the
[19:55] circumcision made without hands and
[19:58] putting off the body of sins of Flesh by
[20:01] circumcision of Christ buried with him
[20:04] in baptism with him through faith and
[20:07] the operation of God who hath from the
[20:09] dead and and I'll just read these last
[20:12] two scriptures here and being dead and
[20:16] being dead in your sins and the
[20:18] uncircumcision of your flesh how he
[20:20] quickened together with him having
[20:22] forgiven all your trespasses and the
[20:25] most important one here blotting out the
[20:27] handwriting of ordinance that was
[20:29] against us which was contrary to us and
[20:32] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[20:34] cross and then I'm going to read another
[20:36] one I know I do this all the time and
[20:38] having spoiled principalities and Powers
[20:41] he made her show them openly trying to
[20:44] let them over them and excuse me for my
[20:47] pronunciation I was going to jump back
[20:49] here
[20:50] to
[20:51] Matthew
[20:54] if I didn't lose my place here
[20:57] I thought I had it more
[21:15] you know sometimes things happen you
[21:18] never know why
[21:22] I'll just I lost my place there and I
[21:25] don't want to say something that I'm not
[21:26] sure about but
[21:29] you know all of us this morning
[21:31] as we strive for life there's only one
[21:34] goal that we should have
[21:37] and that is to be in Christ
[21:40] as his child as a son and daughter of
[21:42] God willing and able to be able to
[21:45] listen to the spirit of Christ as it
[21:47] leads to guide you in the day that we
[21:48] live in and
[21:50] outside of the word of God we're all
[21:52] lost we're hopeless people with outside
[21:54] of the word of God for the hour that we
[21:56] live in this morning it doesn't make us
[21:58] better than anyone else does it make it
[22:00] us more important than anyone else just
[22:02] makes us simple Christians simple
[22:04] Believers in the word of God this
[22:06] morning and uh I'll read this chapter
[22:09] this first chapter of Peter this morning
[22:13] and uh
[22:15] Peter and the Apostle of Jesus Christ to
[22:17] the stranger scattered throughout pontus
[22:19] galathea
[22:21] I've given my pronunciation of tapioca
[22:24] Asia and bifnia elect according to the
[22:28] foreknowledge of God and the father for
[22:30] sanctification of the spirit
[22:32] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[22:35] blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and
[22:38] peace be multiple and that's all the men
[22:41] of God in the New and Old Testament they
[22:43] always put God's peace and Grace upon
[22:45] the people when they speak to him and
[22:48] blessed be the God and father of our
[22:50] Lord Jesus Christ which according to His
[22:52] abundant Mercy have forgotten us again
[22:54] unto our livelihood by the resurrection
[22:57] of Jesus Christ from the dead
[22:59] to an inheritance and corruptible and
[23:02] undefiled that you fadeth not away
[23:04] reserved in heaven for you
[23:08] who are you are kept by the power of God
[23:11] through Strife onto salvation to be
[23:12] ready to revealed last time we're in
[23:15] greatly rejoicing now for you for our
[23:17] season if need be even heaviness through
[23:20] manifold temptations that the trial of
[23:23] your faith being much more precious than
[23:25] gold
[23:26] that perish though would be tried with
[23:28] fire might be found unto praise and
[23:30] honor and Glory at the appearance of
[23:32] Jesus Christ
[23:33] and I'll just finish with that this
[23:35] morning I don't have a lot to say
[23:37] but I you know you that quote that was
[23:41] up there
[23:42] earlier than this morning that was
[23:45] traveling through one about healing if
[23:48] you're not willing to testify to people
[23:50] about what God has done for you both in
[23:53] the physical and the spiritual sense
[23:56] that then what are you if you're not
[23:59] willing to take the word of God and
[24:02] apply it to your life whatever that
[24:04] situation is and walk in it then what
[24:06] are you that that's what that quote
[24:07] talks about are you are you uh are you a
[24:11] hidden Christian are you a visible
[24:13] Christian that's it's just
[24:15] where we're at do people know you're a
[24:18] Christian or when people ask about your
[24:21] do they know what you really are but
[24:23] you're the people you brought up against
[24:25] in the world do they know that you're a
[24:27] Christian or do they have to look at you
[24:29] sometimes the name Sammy to see what you
[24:32] are that's what we want people to know
[24:34] who we are and what we are I mean I do I
[24:37] fall short I I know I fall short
[24:39] sometimes as I get older like I said
[24:41] I've got to watch I I have the same
[24:44] disease my father had when they when he
[24:47] got older I tend to get angry for no
[24:51] reason to get angry and that's not right
[24:52] so I have to watch in my own self as I
[24:55] get older the things that are not right
[24:57] in my own life so the only thing I would
[25:00] say this morning we just need to be I
[25:03] guess the simplest thing to say was you
[25:05] don't need a lot of understanding and we
[25:07] just need to be better something
[25:09] Daughters of God we need to be better
[25:11] Christians and not running after
[25:13] everything that doesn't that won't be
[25:15] there on my day you know we all have to
[25:18] work we all have to provide for our
[25:20] families you know that's that's a given
[25:23] we all have to do that but that not
[25:26] shouldn't you know I have raised my hand
[25:28] here that shouldn't be the only thing I
[25:29] live to do is to work either you should
[25:31] live for to serve Jesus Christ this

[59:48] I will go into the Book of Joshua again
[59:51] Joshua chapter 3.
[59:54] I want to read you this quote as you're

[59:57] words of the Prophet here
[59:59] he says give me a preacher give me a
[1:00:02] Christian Listen Now give me a housewife
[1:00:04] that's a Christian give me a farmer or a

[1:00:21] put on him
[1:00:23] we can go home now
[1:00:27] Joshua chapter three let's let's read
[1:00:29] and we're going to talk today and I've
[1:00:31] got a goal in mind for the day we'll see
[1:00:33] how the Lord leads but I've got a goal
[1:00:36] to accomplish two things we're going to
[1:00:38] get Joshua across that River and we're
[1:00:39] going to tear those walls down before
[1:00:41] the day's over okay we've been here for
[1:00:44] a while and uh I love the history of it
[1:00:46] and I hope I don't bore you with the
[1:00:47] history and the and the uh
[1:00:50] facts of the of what happened but we
[1:00:53] just love the word of God
[1:00:55] Joshua chapter 3 we'll read all this
[1:00:58] chapter and Joshua Rose early in the
[1:01:00] morning and they removed from scheidom
[1:01:02] and came to the Jordan he and all the
[1:01:04] children of Israel and Lodge there
[1:01:06] before they passed over and it came to
[1:01:08] pass after three days that the officers
[1:01:11] went through the host
[1:01:13] and they commanded the people saying
[1:01:15] when ye see the ark
[1:01:19] we gotta learn to keep God first when ye
[1:01:22] see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[1:01:25] your God and the priest the Levites
[1:01:28] bearing it then ye shall remove from
[1:01:31] your place and go after it yet there
[1:01:34] shall be a space between you and it
[1:01:36] about 2 000 cubits by measure that's
[1:01:39] about a half a mile
[1:01:41] okay so now this Ark that is normally
[1:01:43] hidden I want you to remember three
[1:01:45] things about it now everybody can see it
[1:01:49] now everybody can see the ark
[1:01:51] and and and and
[1:01:53] looking at it normally it's on the
[1:01:55] inside but now it's out in view for
[1:01:59] everybody to see and follow this Ark
[1:02:03] and Joshua said unto the people sanctify
[1:02:06] yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do
[1:02:08] wonders amongst you and Joshua spoken to
[1:02:12] the priest saying take up the Ark of the
[1:02:14] Covenant and pass over before the people
[1:02:16] and they took up the Ark of the Covenant
[1:02:18] and went before the people and the Lord
[1:02:20] said unto Joshua this day will I begin
[1:02:23] to magnify thee in the sight of all of
[1:02:25] Israel that they may know that as I was
[1:02:29] with Moses so I will be with thee and I
[1:02:33] believe brothers and sisters that we're
[1:02:34] living in the day and in the hour to
[1:02:37] where when God is looking down there and
[1:02:39] he's looking at us and he's saying I'm
[1:02:40] going to magnify you as the Bride of
[1:02:43] Jesus Christ so that the whole entire
[1:02:46] world will recognize and realize who you
[1:02:49] are
[1:02:51] do you know who you are
[1:02:56] and thou shalt command the priests that
[1:02:58] bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when
[1:03:00] you come to the brink of the water you
[1:03:01] shall stand still in Jordan and Joshua
[1:03:04] said unto the children of Israel come
[1:03:06] hither and hear the words of the Lord
[1:03:08] and Joshua said hereby you shall know
[1:03:11] that the Living God is amongst you can
[1:03:14] you say Amen the Living God is amongst
[1:03:17] you and he will without or let me back
[1:03:21] up and that he will without fail drive
[1:03:25] out from you the Canaanites the Hittites
[1:03:27] the he bites the parasites
[1:03:30] parasites whatever you want to call them
[1:03:33] sicknesses doubt frustrations fears are
[1:03:36] you with me habits slothfulness enemies
[1:03:40] that look so great and so big
[1:03:43] before us he said I will drive all of
[1:03:46] those out verse 11 behold the Ark of the
[1:03:49] Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth
[1:03:51] passeth before
[1:03:52] over before you into Jordan now
[1:03:55] therefore take you 12 men out of the
[1:03:56] tribes of Israel out of every tribe of
[1:03:58] man and this shall come to pass as soon
[1:04:01] as the souls of the feet of the priests
[1:04:03] that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord
[1:04:05] of all the Earth shall rest in the
[1:04:08] waters of Jordan
[1:04:10] aren't you thankful that you got a
[1:04:12] resting place
[1:04:13] they shall rest in the waters of Jordan
[1:04:16] that the Waters of the Jordan shall be
[1:04:18] cut off from the waters that come down
[1:04:20] from above and they shall stand upon a
[1:04:23] heap we're going to get into the details
[1:04:25] of this but that sentence right there is
[1:04:27] quite an amazing statement when you
[1:04:29] research it out and we'll see it in a
[1:04:31] minute and it came to pass that when the
[1:04:33] people removed from their tents to pass
[1:04:35] over Jordan the priests bearing the Ark
[1:04:37] of the Covenant before the people and as
[1:04:40] they bear the ark we're coming to the
[1:04:41] Jordan and the feet of the priests that
[1:04:43] bear the ark were dipped in the brim of
[1:04:45] the water
[1:04:46] for the Jordan overflowed all its banks
[1:04:49] all the time at the time of harvest that
[1:04:52] the waters which came down from above
[1:04:56] this is about 20 miles
[1:04:59] up above where all this water starts
[1:05:01] pouring in okay
[1:05:03] came down from above and stood and Rose
[1:05:05] upon a heap very far from the city of
[1:05:08] Adam and this is beside Zartan and those
[1:05:11] that came toward the Sea of the plain
[1:05:13] and even the salt sea failed
[1:05:15] and were cut off and the people passed
[1:05:18] right over against Jericho and the
[1:05:21] priests that bear the Ark of the
[1:05:22] Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry
[1:05:27] ground
[1:05:30] um in the midst of the Jordan and all
[1:05:33] the Israelites passed over on dry ground
[1:05:35] until all the people were passed clean
[1:05:37] over Jordan so I want to continue our
[1:05:40] thoughts on Kingdom Builders this
[1:05:42] morning and looking at Joshua I want to
[1:05:43] speak on mission impossible mission
[1:05:46] impossible let's pray Heavenly Father we
[1:05:49] come before you this morning with
[1:05:50] grateful hearts and thankful for the
[1:05:53] opportunity we have to come and gather
[1:05:54] into your house and hear the word of God
[1:05:57] and and just to be able to read your
[1:05:58] scriptures knowing that they're they're
[1:06:00] true and infallible and there's there's
[1:06:02] life in the word itself Lord and we're
[1:06:05] thankful for that Lord we just ask as we
[1:06:07] look at this little thought and topic
[1:06:08] that you would just Quicken it to our
[1:06:10] hearts allow me to get myself out of the
[1:06:12] way that you could pull the words that's
[1:06:14] on paper into a living form this morning
[1:06:16] that it would strike into our hearts in
[1:06:18] a way that would just give us overcoming
[1:06:20] power that we could see ourselves in the
[1:06:22] word this morning we can see ourselves
[1:06:24] in the scripture that we are Overcomers
[1:06:26] we're more than able we're more than
[1:06:28] conquerors through Christ we just want
[1:06:31] to tell you we love you and we
[1:06:32] appreciate you in Jesus name we pray
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:35] you can have your seeds
[1:06:39] the prophet says every one of them come
[1:06:41] out from under the pillar of fire they
[1:06:43] come out of the Wilderness believing God
[1:06:46] they march on but when they come to see
[1:06:49] the obstacle
[1:06:51] when they came to see the obstacle
[1:06:53] that's when the ten came back and said
[1:06:56] we can't take the land
[1:06:58] oh my there's Giants there there's this
[1:07:01] and that and the other we just can't do
[1:07:04] it it's impossible
[1:07:07] so in their eyes these Ten Men of God
[1:07:10] Ten Men of the tribes of the children of
[1:07:13] Israel and their minds they begin to
[1:07:15] look at this and they say this is a
[1:07:17] mission that's impossible it can't
[1:07:19] happen they look there and they peered
[1:07:21] over the river and they seen a city
[1:07:23] about a city of about eight or nine
[1:07:25] acres and then this city is double walls
[1:07:29] and I gotta paint this picture for you
[1:07:30] because it's quite amazing it's a double
[1:07:33] walled City that sets up on a knob and
[1:07:36] you come up to the First wall and that
[1:07:37] first wall that you come to is about 23
[1:07:40] feet high
[1:07:41] and from that wall the ground Terraces
[1:07:44] up into the next wall and this double
[1:07:47] walled city was supposed to be fortified
[1:07:49] so that it's impenetrable and that
[1:07:52] second wall as it goes up grows to the
[1:07:55] height the whopping astounding height of
[1:07:57] 46 feet
[1:08:01] 46 feet a lot of times we don't hear
[1:08:03] that we don't paint that picture we just
[1:08:05] know that there was a wall this was a
[1:08:07] fortress this was a impenetrable
[1:08:09] Fortress that they're coming up against
[1:08:11] and they're sitting there and these guys
[1:08:13] are looking and said this is impossible
[1:08:15] but the prophet said what did Caleb and
[1:08:18] Joshua do
[1:08:19] they stealed the people and they said no
[1:08:22] no we are more than able to take this he
[1:08:26] said it was because those people were
[1:08:28] looking at what they could see they were
[1:08:30] looking with their eyes at what they
[1:08:32] could see and what they could look out
[1:08:34] there and touch but Caleb and Joshua was
[1:08:37] looking at more they were looking at the
[1:08:39] promise of God and God said I have given
[1:08:43] you this land go get it
[1:08:48] it's all in the perspective that you're
[1:08:50] looking through others and sisters God
[1:08:52] is looking for more joshuas and more
[1:08:55] calebs in this hour that we're living in
[1:08:57] he's looking for a group of Believers
[1:08:59] That Could See Beyond the obstacles that
[1:09:02] are set before them he's looking for a
[1:09:04] group of people that can come up to the
[1:09:06] river and say hey there's something for
[1:09:08] me on the other side of this River he's
[1:09:11] looking for people that not only sees
[1:09:13] what's on the other side but believes
[1:09:15] they can possess it we're gonna have
[1:09:18] ownership of what God has given us and
[1:09:21] what God has promised us
[1:09:23] he's got to have people who can see
[1:09:25] beyond defeat and doubt and fear let me
[1:09:29] add in our cancer and sugar diabetes and
[1:09:32] seizures and heart issues
[1:09:35] he's going to have people that can see
[1:09:37] beyond those and say God gave me a
[1:09:39] promise
[1:09:43] you know sometimes in life the river
[1:09:45] just looks wide
[1:09:47] right
[1:09:48] the tumor looks too big
[1:09:51] the heart issue looks too detrimental
[1:09:56] the daughter looks impossible
[1:09:59] your fear your doubts
[1:10:01] it gets big and it's wide and you think
[1:10:03] there is no way that I can ever ever get
[1:10:05] across that
[1:10:07] but that is when God steps in and proves
[1:10:11] himself that's when God moves into the
[1:10:14] scene and I want you to remember this
[1:10:16] morning that the greater the battle is
[1:10:18] the greater the victory
[1:10:22] you say I I can overcome this and I can
[1:10:25] overcome that praise God but when that
[1:10:27] battle is so big and so huge that the
[1:10:30] people around you says there's no way
[1:10:31] he'll ever get through it there's no way
[1:10:34] she'll ever overcome that there's no way
[1:10:36] God can move on the scene that's when
[1:10:38] you can step back and say praise God he
[1:10:41] got me through and you can begin to
[1:10:43] worship and praise and give Glory and
[1:10:45] Honor it's a good Almighty who Gets You
[1:10:48] Through The River
[1:10:50] everyone
[1:10:55] the more we overcome the more glory god
[1:10:58] gets
[1:11:02] I feel pretty good now
[1:11:09] we see here that
[1:11:14] he lived the children of Israel out of
[1:11:16] Egypt under what was a strong hand of
[1:11:19] rulership he under a man who was a
[1:11:23] tyrant he let him out of a man who was a
[1:11:27] tyrant and a Tormentor
[1:11:30] of God's Own people
[1:11:32] and he leads them out of there and we
[1:11:34] see that Moses at that time he served
[1:11:37] his Nation for 80 years
[1:11:40] Moses serving the children of Israel
[1:11:42] this faithful servant but now Joshua has
[1:11:47] stepped onto the scene
[1:11:48] Joshua has now stepped on the Saint
[1:11:50] Joshua and Caleb were the two
[1:11:56] slaves in Egypt
[1:11:58] do you realize that
[1:12:00] they were the two remaining members of
[1:12:02] the original ones that come out of Egypt
[1:12:05] and for 40 years Joshua serves as Moses
[1:12:09] great military general for 40 years he's
[1:12:12] provided safety and protection for the
[1:12:14] people for 40 years Joshua was loyal and
[1:12:18] devoted and a real friend and and took
[1:12:20] mentorship from Moses and although his
[1:12:23] call may not have been profound as
[1:12:25] others Joshua here steps in here and he
[1:12:28] is God's choice to lead the children of
[1:12:30] Israel into the Promised Land
[1:12:34] brothers or sisters to the world we may
[1:12:37] not look like much
[1:12:39] to the world they may laugh at us to the
[1:12:43] world they may not understand what we're
[1:12:45] so happy about
[1:12:47] to the world they may understand why we
[1:12:49] preach the way we preach to the world
[1:12:51] they might not understand the why we
[1:12:53] shout the way we shout but I'll tell you
[1:12:54] this I know what I'm shouting about
[1:12:56] because God has done something for each
[1:12:59] and every one of us set in here in this
[1:13:01] day you are the one in a million
[1:13:08] the Bride of Jesus Christ brothers and
[1:13:10] sisters is coming into view
[1:13:13] she is coming into view
[1:13:17] as she sees her vision beyond the river
[1:13:22] Brown says a man that is born of God
[1:13:25] this is the way it may get a little
[1:13:26] sticky for a minute but it's good for us
[1:13:29] a man that is born of God a Son of God
[1:13:32] has to have the nature of God
[1:13:36] he has to be like God he honors God he
[1:13:40] is part of the word of God
[1:13:42] and in this last days
[1:13:44] taking form just exactly the same power
[1:13:47] that he was and at the beginning has
[1:13:50] come up through these organizations and
[1:13:52] so forth and come out for the bride and
[1:13:55] he can't be nothing else but that
[1:13:58] you're one in a million
[1:14:01] group of people and you know people get
[1:14:03] people get a little bit standoffish when
[1:14:05] we say that well you think you're better
[1:14:07] than everybody you think you're more you
[1:14:09] think you you think you live better you
[1:14:11] think your life is cleaner I'll tell you
[1:14:13] this I don't think that but I'll tell
[1:14:15] you what I know I know that a born-again
[1:14:18] Christian
[1:14:19] will despise the things that God
[1:14:22] despises
[1:14:24] a born-again Christian will despise
[1:14:26] everything that is evil in the sight of
[1:14:28] God
[1:14:30] a born-again Christian will love
[1:14:32] everything that God loves
[1:14:34] and when I say that I want to make I
[1:14:36] want to give yourself an example of what
[1:14:38] I'm trying to get across to you if you
[1:14:40] just you're born again Christian
[1:14:41] despises the things that God despises
[1:14:45] build as far as nicotine
[1:14:48] they'll despise alcohol
[1:14:50] that was fires drugs they'll despise
[1:14:54] pornography they'll describe the despise
[1:14:56] filth
[1:14:59] what about a person who's hung up on
[1:15:01] those things
[1:15:02] I didn't say that you wasn't a
[1:15:04] born-again Christian
[1:15:06] but I said you will despise it
[1:15:09] you may have to battle those things you
[1:15:11] may that may be your river that you're
[1:15:13] coming up to that may be your Jordan
[1:15:16] but if you live around that Jordan long
[1:15:19] enough it'll make you so sick of it
[1:15:21] it'll make you so miserable and it'll
[1:15:23] make you hate that thing so much that
[1:15:26] you'll say God deliver me I need
[1:15:30] Deliverance I need to walk across the
[1:15:33] Jordan River this morning
[1:15:38] it doesn't make us better
[1:15:42] it doesn't make us uh above anybody
[1:15:45] but it says that there is such a love in
[1:15:49] the hearts of those people that they do
[1:15:51] not want to hurt their God
[1:15:55] they don't want to hurt the love of
[1:15:58] their life
[1:16:00] there's a lady sitting right here I
[1:16:02] would do nothing to hurt the love of my
[1:16:04] life
[1:16:05] have I made mistakes you better believe
[1:16:06] it
[1:16:08] has she want to choke me more than once
[1:16:12] but it wasn't intentional
[1:16:14] did she forgive me you better believe
[1:16:17] she did she still cooks for me if you
[1:16:19] can't tell
[1:16:21] I love her the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:24] loves Jesus Christ
[1:16:30] you're built to overcome
[1:16:33] brothers and sisters the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:34] Christ can't be nothing but
[1:16:37] Overcomers
[1:16:39] they can't be nothing but Overcomers
[1:16:41] because she sees further than the
[1:16:43] obstacle that's placed in front of her
[1:16:45] and her goal is to finish what she
[1:16:48] starts you know Paul says it's not the
[1:16:50] one who starts the race but it's the one
[1:16:52] who finishes the race
[1:16:55] and so here we are this morning we ought
[1:16:57] to make sure that we're the ones that
[1:16:59] are finished in the race you know over 2
[1:17:01] million Israelites left Egypt
[1:17:05] over 2 million Israelites started out on
[1:17:08] that race from Egypt they were running
[1:17:10] can you imagine as as that red sea part
[1:17:12] that they ran across there they sang
[1:17:14] They danced they shouted they played
[1:17:16] tambourines
[1:17:19] two
[1:17:21] two went into the Promised Land
[1:17:25] they couldn't finish the race that
[1:17:27] they've started and the prophet tells us
[1:17:30] he said they should have seen it the
[1:17:31] Jews and their days they should have
[1:17:32] seen it because it was all manifested in
[1:17:34] front of them but then God looks at him
[1:17:36] and says they're everyone dead
[1:17:41] I don't want God to look down at this
[1:17:43] assembly
[1:17:44] or any assembly around this world and
[1:17:46] say look at them they started out to try
[1:17:49] to win this race and they had a lot of
[1:17:51] fire and Thurber when they started but
[1:17:53] look at them they're all dead now
[1:17:57] and I think it's something when the
[1:18:00] prophet talks about one in a million or
[1:18:02] two coming out of two million with Caleb
[1:18:04] and Joshua but it's an amazing thing
[1:18:07] that he he he ties this to the Natural
[1:18:10] conception of human life
[1:18:14] think about it
[1:18:15] the natural conception of human life you
[1:18:18] have an egg in the female you're gonna
[1:18:20] get a little scientific here so bear
[1:18:21] with me you've heard it before he
[1:18:23] mentions this so it's nothing nothing
[1:18:25] heard before you have an egg and then a
[1:18:27] female and that egg is a receptor and
[1:18:30] then the male discharges
[1:18:32] life
[1:18:35] by the Millions
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:38] of the millions did you hear what I said
[1:18:42] and one fights until he gets to the egg
[1:18:48] Millions
[1:18:50] science has been able to put it in video
[1:18:53] and it's an amazing thing to watch as
[1:18:56] the germs sail the sperm and the germ
[1:18:58] cell it's life it lives its fight it's
[1:19:00] battle it's going through the mucous
[1:19:02] membranes
[1:19:03] to get to that egg and it's fighting all
[1:19:05] the way to get there what is it there's
[1:19:07] something on the inside that says I
[1:19:09] gotta live
[1:19:11] there's something on the inside of you
[1:19:14] that said You Gotta live you fall from
[1:19:17] the very day of conception to be where
[1:19:20] you're at this morning
[1:19:24] so don't tell me you're not special
[1:19:27] don't tell me you're not wanting a
[1:19:29] million you're a miracle setting here
[1:19:32] today the prophet said himself he said
[1:19:34] because there's something someone made
[1:19:37] this one fertile and ordained this one
[1:19:39] and he predestination by predestination
[1:19:42] my brother sure God has determined I
[1:19:45] like this because it dispels
[1:19:47] the boy girl thing God has to determine
[1:19:51] whether you're going to be a boy or a
[1:19:53] girl
[1:19:55] God has to determine whether you're
[1:19:57] going to be a redhead or a blackhead or
[1:19:58] whatever it is it's determined by God he
[1:20:01] said it's more of a mystery than the
[1:20:04] Virgin birth to me
[1:20:06] wow what
[1:20:09] don't you love science I love science
[1:20:13] when it proves God's word
[1:20:18] there were two million to come out sung
[1:20:21] and shouted and done everything he said
[1:20:23] spoken tongues they shouted they give
[1:20:25] God glory danced up and down the sea and
[1:20:28] done everything that all the rest of
[1:20:29] them did but there were only two that
[1:20:32] went into that Promised Land Caleb and
[1:20:34] Joshua that's the one out of a million
[1:20:38] that's the one out of a million in
[1:20:39] natural birth every one of them had the
[1:20:41] same blessings
[1:20:46] that's not good enough just to hang out
[1:20:48] around Church
[1:20:49] it's not good enough just to say you go
[1:20:51] to this church or this is your pastor or
[1:20:53] that's your pastor or this or I go to
[1:20:55] this meeting every year that's not good
[1:20:57] enough
[1:21:00] there has to be something on the inside
[1:21:03] brothers and sisters when Moses sent the
[1:21:05] spies over
[1:21:07] sent one out of every tribe you know and
[1:21:09] they come back and out of their own
[1:21:11] mouth they testified this is a good land
[1:21:17] how many of us this morning say this is
[1:21:20] a good message
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:23] God's promises are good in my life
[1:21:27] you're testifying with the mouth they
[1:21:29] testified with their own mouth but then
[1:21:31] they couldn't be content with that
[1:21:33] but then they had to look through their
[1:21:35] eyes and they said oh mercy
[1:21:38] oh mercy we can't take it oh my
[1:21:42] God the amorites are there they make us
[1:21:44] look like grasshoppers beside them
[1:21:46] they're Mighty Men they're army men
[1:21:49] they're military men their their walls
[1:21:52] are big and they're huge
[1:21:54] I wish I'd have just died down in Egypt
[1:21:59] can you imagine
[1:22:01] can you imagine after all they had seen
[1:22:04] God do
[1:22:06] think back about the plagues think back
[1:22:09] about the the blood token over the door
[1:22:12] and the Death Angel passing through and
[1:22:15] not a single soul of the Israelites
[1:22:17] under that token was harmed
[1:22:21] not a single one
[1:22:23] and they've seen all of this but yet
[1:22:26] here they look back and they say the
[1:22:28] walls are two big
[1:22:31] but Joshua and Caleb he says they jumped
[1:22:34] up and quieted them and said we're more
[1:22:36] than able yes sir there's the one he
[1:22:38] said now look what happened Joshua and
[1:22:41] Caleb knew that God gave the promise he
[1:22:43] said I don't care how big it is how much
[1:22:46] the obstacles are how high they are how
[1:22:48] great they are he said that don't have
[1:22:51] nothing to do with it
[1:22:54] you know sometimes we blow things up
[1:22:57] and when we realize we're just really
[1:22:59] just a really small portion of dust of
[1:23:03] what God has done in this universe
[1:23:05] we make our problems so big and think he
[1:23:07] can't handle them
[1:23:13] he said God said so and we can take it
[1:23:16] he said do you know that there were only
[1:23:17] two people like that only out of two and
[1:23:20] a half million that ever crossed into
[1:23:22] the promised land because they held
[1:23:24] their faith and what God Said was the
[1:23:27] truth
[1:23:30] we have to find ourselves in this day we
[1:23:33] have to have ourselves holding on to the
[1:23:34] promises of God holding on to the
[1:23:36] promises it says I can be healed hold on
[1:23:39] to the promises it says I can be
[1:23:41] delivered hold on to the promises it
[1:23:43] says I can get by these obstacles God
[1:23:46] cares about my well-being God cares
[1:23:49] about me making a rapture
[1:23:53] that's exactly right and Joshua comes up
[1:23:56] to his first major task
[1:23:59] he comes up to his first major task of
[1:24:01] Crossing this Jordan Crossing the Jordan
[1:24:04] River which signifies leaving behind my
[1:24:07] old life
[1:24:09] the children Israel come up there and
[1:24:11] Joshua can you imagine him preaching
[1:24:13] this is it guys
[1:24:15] this is what we've dreamed of this is
[1:24:18] what we've longed for this is what God
[1:24:20] has promised us look over there it's
[1:24:22] soon to be ours can you imagine as he
[1:24:25] looks out there and he says today we're
[1:24:27] going to leave
[1:24:28] everything that's holding us back
[1:24:31] everything that's hindering us
[1:24:33] everything that's making us sick and
[1:24:35] depressed and sad
[1:24:37] we're leaving all of that back behind us
[1:24:40] the past is the past and today's a new
[1:24:43] life
[1:24:47] but as he preached those words
[1:24:50] they had to realize that there had to be
[1:24:52] a full commitment to this promise
[1:24:55] there's a commitment that had to be made
[1:24:57] to cross the Jordan River this River
[1:25:00] brothers and sisters was out of its
[1:25:01] banks
[1:25:04] it was in the Harvest Time of the Year
[1:25:09] let me let me break this down for you
[1:25:11] think about it this way
[1:25:13] here's another Red Sea situation
[1:25:18] do you know how long it was between the
[1:25:21] Red Sea and the crossing of the Jordan
[1:25:23] see anybody want a venture to throw a
[1:25:25] number out there
[1:25:28] it floored me
[1:25:30] 11 days
[1:25:36] 11 days
[1:25:39] less than two weeks ago
[1:25:43] they saw Moses
[1:25:46] Stan
[1:25:48] with his arms up and the winds blowing
[1:25:51] from the East and separate the Red Sea
[1:25:54] so that they could walk across on dry
[1:25:56] land and watch the Seas consume pharaoh
[1:25:59] and all of his armies
[1:26:03] 11 days you say how you know it's 11
[1:26:05] days it was an 11 day Journey
[1:26:08] from where they was when I crossed the
[1:26:11] Red Sea to the Jordan River
[1:26:14] but because of what they saw on the
[1:26:16] other side of the Jordan River they
[1:26:18] wandered for 40 years
[1:26:25] can you imagine Joshua
[1:26:28] can you imagine the commitment and the
[1:26:30] dedication that he had to have in his
[1:26:32] life to come up to their first of all to
[1:26:35] be one of the spies that goes in and
[1:26:36] says we can do this Brothers
[1:26:39] we can do this and then they leave and
[1:26:41] cross the Red Sea and they walk up to
[1:26:43] the Jordan and he's thinking marching up
[1:26:45] let's keep going everybody says no no we
[1:26:48] got to stop they're too big
[1:26:51] and for two years he lived by the law
[1:26:53] and for 38 more they wandered
[1:27:00] what did they do while they were
[1:27:02] wandering
[1:27:04] they were blessed
[1:27:06] so don't always think that your
[1:27:07] blessings
[1:27:12] it's fresh now
[1:27:14] don't think that your blessings are
[1:27:16] always what it means that you're one of
[1:27:18] them that you're the chosen that you're
[1:27:20] committed and you've dedicated
[1:27:22] you make sure that your heart is right
[1:27:24] you make sure that you've committed to
[1:27:26] yourself deep down on the inside this
[1:27:28] says I'm one of gods and I want failing
[1:27:30] I won't let down I'll keep pressing on
[1:27:33] when the battle gets rough I'm Gonna
[1:27:35] Keep marching forward
[1:27:43] 11 days
[1:27:45] 40 years
[1:27:48] they're going to need a supernatural
[1:27:50] intervention
[1:27:51] because this River has come out of its
[1:27:53] banks
[1:27:55] this River has come out of its banks and
[1:27:57] its rivers now what's normally a hundred
[1:28:00] feet wide and maybe
[1:28:02] 10 to 30 feet deep is now over a mile
[1:28:05] wide
[1:28:06] and rivers and Waters are running in
[1:28:09] from the upper upper part from the north
[1:28:11] lands are just flooding into this and
[1:28:13] now a mile wide river stands before them
[1:28:17] oh
[1:28:21] you know it usually wouldn't have
[1:28:23] presented itself as a problem
[1:28:29] we got things in our life that don't
[1:28:31] really present us a problem do they
[1:28:33] I don't have a problem smoking I don't
[1:28:35] have a problem drinking I don't have a
[1:28:37] problem cussing I don't have a problem
[1:28:38] chasing women I don't have a problem
[1:28:40] doing all those things
[1:28:43] at one time they come up to this River
[1:28:46] and sit there for 40 years looking at
[1:28:48] this river that was a hundred foot wide
[1:28:50] wasn't really a big problem they could
[1:28:51] have probably took it
[1:28:53] but God wanted to show he's God
[1:28:56] God wanted to show he's God so he said
[1:28:59] down there and he began to do things in
[1:29:01] such a way that only God can do God sets
[1:29:04] us River in motion allows it to back up
[1:29:07] for 20 miles of my wife just so that man
[1:29:11] can't take credit for what he's about to
[1:29:13] do
[1:29:15] if you're taking credit for something in
[1:29:17] your life
[1:29:19] um
[1:29:21] is God in it
[1:29:24] because I can do nothing on my own
[1:29:27] you can do nothing on your own
[1:29:29] everything you have everything that
[1:29:31] you've been given everything that you
[1:29:34] know that that God has given you it's
[1:29:36] God's done it God's Made A Way God's
[1:29:39] blessed your business God bless your
[1:29:40] home God bless your children God save
[1:29:42] your children God saved your life
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:46] if I could save children I would save
[1:29:48] everyone to ever come in contact with
[1:29:51] nobody wants to send anybody lost but
[1:29:52] it's God that has to do the saving
[1:29:58] so God now has placed a river in their
[1:30:01] way
[1:30:02] and this Jordan River is swelled up
[1:30:05] and it's wide and wider than it normally
[1:30:08] is and nobody could cross this River on
[1:30:11] their own
[1:30:15] and brothers and sisters
[1:30:18] sometimes we have to face a swollen
[1:30:21] River
[1:30:24] has anybody ever faced a swollen River
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:29] we go through things in our lives
[1:30:33] that you think is going to bury you
[1:30:37] you go through hardships in your life
[1:30:39] that'll take you to your knees
[1:30:43] not in prayer but in and discouragement
[1:30:45] and depression and fear and in doubt
[1:30:50] you let the doctor tell you you got six
[1:30:52] months to live
[1:30:54] you let the doctor tell you if you'd
[1:30:56] like brother Tommy if you do too much
[1:30:57] exertion you're a dead man
[1:31:03] those are swollen Rivers
[1:31:07] you get a phone call in the middle of
[1:31:09] night that something's happened to your
[1:31:10] family
[1:31:11] that's a swollen River
[1:31:15] you want your children as they go astray
[1:31:18] you talk about a swollen River
[1:31:22] that's a swollen River
[1:31:24] and you ask yourself how am I going to
[1:31:26] get across it you won't
[1:31:29] you won't in yourself
[1:31:32] but I know a god
[1:31:34] I know a god who's able to dry up the
[1:31:36] Red Sea he's able to dry up the River
[1:31:38] Jordan he's able to allow you to walk
[1:31:40] across on dry land if you'll just do
[1:31:43] what he asks you to do
[1:31:46] I don't know what kind of obstacles
[1:31:48] you're facing in your life this morning
[1:31:49] some of you I know you're going through
[1:31:51] things some of you has got challenges
[1:31:53] some of you has got doctors that
[1:31:54] pronounce things on you that you don't
[1:31:55] agree with and you don't want to accept
[1:31:57] don't accept it look across the river
[1:31:59] and say my God is able my God's a
[1:32:02] healing
[1:32:03] my God's a deliverer my God crosses
[1:32:06] Rivers this morning
[1:32:13] I'm looking at the the children of
[1:32:15] Israel we begin to look at this account
[1:32:16] there
[1:32:18] and I thought you know
[1:32:20] the very same thing that allowed them to
[1:32:22] get across that River three thousand
[1:32:24] years ago is the very same thing that
[1:32:27] allows me to get across my Rivers today
[1:32:30] it didn't change
[1:32:32] God didn't change the way he does things
[1:32:34] God don't change nothing about his
[1:32:37] program if he could do it for them he
[1:32:38] can do it for me if he does it for me he
[1:32:40] can do it for you that's the way God
[1:32:43] works brother Brown said something about
[1:32:45] it hallelujah what is it he says there
[1:32:47] is a deep calling out to that deep
[1:32:49] and we hear this quote and use this
[1:32:51] quote a lot he said but there's a hunger
[1:32:53] in that human heart to move out and do
[1:32:56] something for God he said I've seen
[1:32:59] Joshua and he's standing there
[1:33:02] I seen Joshua and he's standing there
[1:33:04] and he says how's he going
[1:33:07] to get a
[1:33:08] cross this River he said look there was
[1:33:10] no
[1:33:11] Bridges
[1:33:13] there was no arches there was no steel
[1:33:16] there was no materials there's no wood
[1:33:18] because that's the way we are as humans
[1:33:20] right no doubt Joshua looked there and
[1:33:22] thought man can we float across this can
[1:33:24] I build a build a dam back here here and
[1:33:27] try to try to get the people enough
[1:33:29] shallow water we can swim across this
[1:33:31] what can we do how can we do this any
[1:33:34] carpenters in here your Builders you're
[1:33:36] gonna try to figure out a way across
[1:33:38] that River and no doubt he was there but
[1:33:40] there was no materials nothing like that
[1:33:42] for him to get across nothing
[1:33:45] but the muddy
[1:33:47] swollen Jordan River
[1:33:51] and he said he looked back there and he
[1:33:52] seen tens of thousands and thousands of
[1:33:55] Jews
[1:33:59] and he's looking there at this River
[1:34:02] and he's looking back at his
[1:34:04] congregation
[1:34:05] and he's looking at this River and he
[1:34:08] looks at his congregation
[1:34:10] and he says you know what
[1:34:12] God Will Make A Way
[1:34:16] that was all the word that he had to
[1:34:18] give to his congregation God Will Make A
[1:34:21] Way I don't know how he's going to do it
[1:34:24] I don't know when he's going to do it
[1:34:27] but when the word comes we
[1:34:30] will go
[1:34:32] to church
[1:34:34] hold on to the prom
[1:34:37] ISE he said and if God promises it God
[1:34:41] will keep his word he said if God
[1:34:43] promises to heal you he'll do it
[1:34:49] was it muddy walking up to that River
[1:34:53] do you still feel the symptoms sometimes
[1:34:57] maybe you're treating in a little bit of
[1:34:59] mud as you're coming up to the river
[1:35:02] maybe you can feel it
[1:35:05] it's holding you back
[1:35:07] you're getting stuck you're getting
[1:35:08] deeper and deeper
[1:35:13] but if God promised it
[1:35:16] he'll do it if God promises to give you
[1:35:18] the Holy Ghost he'll do it he said if
[1:35:21] you'll just come and repent and be
[1:35:22] baptized and believe in him and Watch
[1:35:24] What Happens he'll fill you with the
[1:35:26] Holy Ghost because God
[1:35:29] God is obligated
[1:35:32] obligated to his word he can't take his
[1:35:35] word back he's got to keep his word in
[1:35:37] order to be God
[1:35:42] if God would have brought them up to
[1:35:44] that Jordan River
[1:35:47] after he had told them for 40 some odd
[1:35:50] years you're going to go across it and
[1:35:53] then he looks and said you know what
[1:35:54] I don't I don't think it's possible
[1:35:56] Joshua
[1:35:58] you know what that would have made God
[1:36:00] a liar
[1:36:03] God can't be a liar
[1:36:05] it's Satan that's the LIE
[1:36:08] it's Satan the one that tells you all
[1:36:11] these things and places all these
[1:36:12] obstacles in your path but God says
[1:36:14] don't listen to the lies listen to The
[1:36:16] Promise listen to what I told you listen
[1:36:18] to what I could do and Trust in what I
[1:36:20] can do that was the assurance that
[1:36:23] Joshua had been given by God almighty
[1:36:26] listen to the word
[1:36:30] Joshua received four Commandments
[1:36:33] trying to hurry
[1:36:35] commandment number one cross over this
[1:36:37] Jordan
[1:36:39] in other words this is your task
[1:36:41] cross over this Jordan
[1:36:44] the next one was to be strong and very
[1:36:46] courageous this is your attitude
[1:36:52] I don't recall him ever saying uh
[1:36:55] walking weakness
[1:36:57] cow down to the enemy listen to the liar
[1:37:00] I don't ever recall that being the
[1:37:02] attitude no he said be strong and
[1:37:04] courageous Joshua here's the attitude
[1:37:06] you must have and when you go over there
[1:37:08] divide the people their inheritance this
[1:37:11] is your destiny
[1:37:14] this is your destiny this is your
[1:37:16] god-given rights your god-given lands
[1:37:18] your god-given possessions
[1:37:21] God has divvied out to the bride of
[1:37:24] Christ who she is
[1:37:26] the word of God was given to us
[1:37:30] you talking about an inheritance
[1:37:32] you're talking about a possession you're
[1:37:35] talking about something that you can
[1:37:36] hold on to when the message of the hour
[1:37:38] broke and the Word was revealed
[1:37:40] to you one in a million
[1:37:47] because other command was obey God's
[1:37:49] Commandments completely
[1:37:52] this is a challenge
[1:37:55] you know sometimes it's a it's hard to
[1:37:58] obey God's word completely
[1:38:01] oh y'all quiet
[1:38:05] it's hard to obey vague word completely
[1:38:10] but Joshua stood there and he stayed
[1:38:14] with his message
[1:38:17] he stayed with what
[1:38:19] was told before him
[1:38:23] who did the original word come to Moses
[1:38:27] right
[1:38:29] Moses is the one who was originally was
[1:38:31] told about the promised land and told
[1:38:32] about the promise and told about the
[1:38:34] inheritance but Moses now is dead and
[1:38:37] Joshua was sitting there and Joshua now
[1:38:39] has this promise and it's his promise
[1:38:41] now he's holding on to the promise and
[1:38:44] the three promises were given to him
[1:38:46] that no one will be able to stand before
[1:38:47] you
[1:38:49] you know sometimes as Believers we we
[1:38:52] back away from situations
[1:38:56] we back away from situations when all we
[1:38:58] got to do is rely on God's strength
[1:39:01] we back away because we get scared we
[1:39:04] let fear consume us we let doubt we let
[1:39:07] anxiety
[1:39:09] sure
[1:39:11] I'll tell my wife the other day I said
[1:39:13] you know what I used to love scuba
[1:39:15] diving and it says no this is not a
[1:39:16] spiritual thing but just just take the
[1:39:18] the analogy here I used to love to go
[1:39:20] scuba diving but it scared me
[1:39:24] I couldn't do it I I get down to 105
[1:39:26] feet under water and the first thing
[1:39:28] goes to my mind if this tank runs out
[1:39:30] I'm dead
[1:39:32] I can't get back to the surface quick
[1:39:34] enough and if I do my my brains are
[1:39:36] gonna blow up
[1:39:37] wow you know that's what I'm thinking at
[1:39:39] 105 feet down there trying to scoop it
[1:39:40] up
[1:39:42] has anybody ever done it
[1:39:43] Austin has Adriana has right no she said
[1:39:47] now now
[1:39:52] but if we allow fears to come and
[1:39:55] consume us
[1:39:56] we allow the enemy to win one over on us
[1:40:00] speaking spiritually if you allow Satan
[1:40:02] to tell you that you're not going to
[1:40:03] make a Rapture you're allowing fear to
[1:40:06] come into your life speaking spiritually
[1:40:08] if you let Satan tell you that your
[1:40:09] children are not going to make it that
[1:40:11] they're going off on astray and you
[1:40:13] didn't teach them correctly you've
[1:40:15] allowed fear and doubt to come into your
[1:40:16] life when the promise is all that that
[1:40:19] you that has served me will be given
[1:40:23] raise a child up in the way and they
[1:40:25] shall not stray you're doing that right
[1:40:27] that's a promise that's a that's a
[1:40:29] written word and commandment of God
[1:40:31] raise a child up in the way that they
[1:40:33] should go and they will not depart from
[1:40:35] it as they grow old
[1:40:37] do you believe that promise
[1:40:39] why do we cry
[1:40:43] well we're going to move on
[1:40:46] Joshua's standing here now in this
[1:40:47] Valley of decision
[1:40:49] and they're here to this point of the
[1:40:51] journey
[1:40:52] and up to this time they had relied
[1:40:54] completely on Moses
[1:40:57] they complained as they followed they
[1:41:00] listened to the voice of Moses they
[1:41:02] followed Moses they followed a cloud my
[1:41:05] day in a pillar Fire by night they had
[1:41:08] Manna they had Quail when they hungry
[1:41:10] they ate when they were thirsty they
[1:41:13] drink
[1:41:14] they had everything that they could
[1:41:16] possibly want their clothes weren't even
[1:41:18] worn or tattered after 40 years can you
[1:41:20] imagine wearing what you're wearing
[1:41:21] today 40 years from now
[1:41:24] that's a pretty powerful God in itself
[1:41:28] their clothes weren't torn or tattered
[1:41:30] they lived as children without
[1:41:31] responsibility and you know that's what
[1:41:33] a lot of people around the message try
[1:41:35] to do they try to live as children
[1:41:37] without responsibility they want to be
[1:41:39] in the message they want to be in the
[1:41:40] bride they want to be in God's program
[1:41:42] but they don't want the responsibility
[1:41:44] that it takes to live it
[1:41:47] Moses had gently led him along Moses had
[1:41:51] prayed for him he wept over him he
[1:41:53] carried them all in his heart and
[1:41:55] pampered and pet him but now Joshua's on
[1:41:57] the scene this is a different kind of
[1:41:59] guy
[1:41:59] Joshua is a different kind of leader
[1:42:01] he's a different kind of character and
[1:42:03] Joshua is moving in a New Direction and
[1:42:06] he's telling the children of Israel the
[1:42:08] days of being passive the days of being
[1:42:10] soft the days of giving in to the enemy
[1:42:13] they're over
[1:42:15] did you hear what I said
[1:42:17] the days of being passive and giving in
[1:42:20] and giving over to the enemy they're
[1:42:22] over and brothers and sisters Joshua
[1:42:24] knows that if Israel is going to possess
[1:42:26] the land they must be aggressive and
[1:42:30] deliberate and be willing to fight and
[1:42:32] take it because it's yours go get it
[1:42:37] and so here they are now and they
[1:42:39] they're coming up to this Raging Waters
[1:42:41] of the Jordan
[1:42:43] for three days isn't that something how
[1:42:45] it's three days
[1:42:46] did you ever think about that
[1:42:49] three days and he rose
[1:42:53] three days standing there looking at
[1:42:56] this water
[1:42:58] three days the waters are raging some of
[1:43:01] these people probably were gripped by
[1:43:02] fear
[1:43:03] some of them are probably sitting there
[1:43:05] trying to decide are we are we going
[1:43:07] across and Joshua says don't talk that
[1:43:09] way
[1:43:09] [Applause]
[1:43:10] don't talk that way this is ours
[1:43:14] but but I don't want to hear no butts
[1:43:16] you ever you ever do your kids that way
[1:43:17] but but I don't want to hear no butts no
[1:43:20] ifs ands or buts you're doing this
[1:43:23] and that's the way Joshua had to
[1:43:25] approach them don't tell me none of your
[1:43:27] negativity
[1:43:28] don't give me none of your doubt because
[1:43:30] in my mind it's mine and I'm going
[1:43:35] many people choose to live in a valley
[1:43:37] of indecision
[1:43:39] they can't decide from one day or the
[1:43:41] other are they in or are they out
[1:43:43] am I a Christian today and and a and a
[1:43:47] hang tomorrow
[1:43:48] what am I oh church was good but my
[1:43:52] friends are good on Monday
[1:43:54] you know what I'm saying you've seen
[1:43:55] those people they're in the set
[1:43:57] indecisive they can't make their mind up
[1:43:59] they don't know if they're in or they're
[1:44:00] out and here they stand in this Valley
[1:44:03] and God brothers and sisters has offered
[1:44:05] salvation to anybody that would accept
[1:44:08] it
[1:44:14] if you ignore God's choice or God's
[1:44:16] decision his offer it's your choice
[1:44:21] it's your choice we choose I chose on a
[1:44:25] certain day
[1:44:25] that I was going to do this
[1:44:28] now has it always been a flyer and
[1:44:30] better bees now we know better than that
[1:44:32] the prophet taught us better than that
[1:44:35] it's a battle and
[1:44:38] leaders like Joshua people who will get
[1:44:40] up and preach the word of God and preach
[1:44:43] against sin and preach against writing
[1:44:45] and Ruckus
[1:44:46] and we'll tell the people where the
[1:44:48] rubber meets the road and getting those
[1:44:49] people ready that's what we need in an
[1:44:52] hour that we're living in when
[1:44:54] everything goes
[1:44:56] if you're not careful you'll find
[1:44:58] yourself in a trap that you fall in
[1:45:00] there that well everybody else
[1:45:04] right
[1:45:06] you can't worry about everybody else
[1:45:15] Joshua
[1:45:16] we'll get him across this River for just
[1:45:18] a minute I'm going to show you how he's
[1:45:20] going to get across that River
[1:45:23] Joshua he wakes up into a state of
[1:45:25] Readiness he rises up early in the
[1:45:28] morning and he's got great anticipation
[1:45:30] and he knows we're going a new direction
[1:45:32] today
[1:45:34] everything's fixing to change the life
[1:45:36] that we once knew we'll know no more
[1:45:38] we're going to have what God has had us
[1:45:40] to inherit for us for all of our days
[1:45:43] that I've been wandering through this
[1:45:44] silly Wilderness for 40 years do you
[1:45:47] ever feel like you're wandering through
[1:45:48] a Wilderness a silly Wilderness for four
[1:45:50] years
[1:45:54] thank you
[1:45:56] and Joshua comes down there and he
[1:45:59] begins to
[1:46:00] preach to the people teach the people
[1:46:02] talk to the people in Courage however
[1:46:04] you want to put it because for years the
[1:46:07] pillar of the cloud and the pillar of
[1:46:09] fire was above them
[1:46:11] and every person went from day by day by
[1:46:14] day just as an ordinary day
[1:46:18] you saw the pillar or cloud
[1:46:22] for 40 years you saw this
[1:46:25] for 40 years and a Nightfall comes for
[1:46:28] 40 years you saw the pillar of Fire
[1:46:31] if it moved you moved
[1:46:34] if it went this way you went this way
[1:46:37] but now the commission has changed
[1:46:40] now the commission has changed because
[1:46:42] now the word of God says I'm going to
[1:46:45] bring out my Ark
[1:46:47] stay with me now he says now I'm going
[1:46:50] to bring out my Ark and people must keep
[1:46:53] their eyes on this Ark
[1:46:55] and people have to keep their eyes on
[1:46:57] this Ark in a way they never have before
[1:46:59] each person now is having to take
[1:47:02] responsibility for their own life now
[1:47:06] the people have come into a place that
[1:47:08] they're going to have to have a personal
[1:47:09] relationship with God you know there's a
[1:47:13] lot there's a time in your life when you
[1:47:14] can hang around church and you can hang
[1:47:16] around friends in the church and you can
[1:47:18] go to meetings and groups and this and
[1:47:19] that but there comes a day when you have
[1:47:21] to have that personal relationship with
[1:47:24] Christ and if you haven't had it seek it
[1:47:29] foreign
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:36] it held three items
[1:47:38] the first one
[1:47:40] The Ten Commandments the tablets that
[1:47:42] Moses was given the Ten Commandments are
[1:47:44] inside the Ark of the Covenant
[1:47:46] secondly it held a jar a golden jar
[1:47:50] of manna sealed up and placed in the ark
[1:47:54] and thirdly it held Aaron's budding rod
[1:48:01] Matthew Henry who writes commentaries
[1:48:03] years and years long ago
[1:48:05] probably one of the greatest preachers
[1:48:07] him and some of those other old guys
[1:48:09] that just really knew the word and dug
[1:48:11] into it
[1:48:17] the church was taught
[1:48:19] how it was fed and how it was ruled
[1:48:26] the law came down from God
[1:48:29] the Manna came down from God
[1:48:32] Aaron's budding Rod was the life of God
[1:48:36] and so now the people that they come up
[1:48:38] to this to this to this River now and
[1:48:41] they're sitting here and the
[1:48:42] instructions are very clear
[1:48:44] don't crowd the ark remember we said
[1:48:46] what was it two two thousand cubits
[1:48:49] that's about a half a mile
[1:48:51] stay a half a mile away from the ark why
[1:48:54] was that
[1:48:56] why did they have to stay a half a mile
[1:48:58] away from the ark
[1:49:00] different Scholars that disagree and
[1:49:02] they agree on different things but I
[1:49:04] liked what I said what I heard when they
[1:49:05] said they they wanted he wanted the
[1:49:07] children of Israel to be able to have to
[1:49:09] look and focus and see God in action
[1:49:15] he wanted to be able to look out there
[1:49:17] and see but yet still keep the sanctity
[1:49:20] of God
[1:49:22] you know sometimes people we get so so
[1:49:24] uh so involved around church and around
[1:49:27] God that God really doesn't hold the the
[1:49:30] sanctity that he should hold
[1:49:32] and we have to be careful with that and
[1:49:34] that's what the children of Israel had
[1:49:35] to do they had to be careful with what
[1:49:38] they were doing with the ark and Joshua
[1:49:41] tells him he says sanctify yourselves
[1:49:44] for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders
[1:49:46] amongst us
[1:49:48] clean yourselves up is what he was
[1:49:50] saying clean yourselves up live a clean
[1:49:52] life if you got dirt on you clean it up
[1:49:54] if you've got filth in your life clean
[1:49:57] it up why because God can't do
[1:49:59] miraculous things in a dirty life
[1:50:01] [Applause]
[1:50:04] foreign
[1:50:05] God always does wonders among sanctified
[1:50:09] people have you ever noticed that
[1:50:11] God can do wonders in your life when
[1:50:14] you're living the life that you should
[1:50:15] be living but the next thing you know
[1:50:17] your little sins your little lifestyle
[1:50:18] your little habits begin to come in do
[1:50:20] you see God really moving in action then
[1:50:23] no no God can't use that vessel why
[1:50:26] because that little Dove has flown off
[1:50:28] the holy spirit is has went away and
[1:50:30] said I can't I can't handle this no more
[1:50:35] so if we expect the Lord to do wonders
[1:50:37] amongst us let's clean our lives up rid
[1:50:40] ourselves of doubt and fear and unbelief
[1:50:55] then Joshua looked and I'm closing I'm
[1:50:58] not going along today
[1:51:00] and then Joshua looked and he took the
[1:51:03] Ark of the Covenant and he told him he
[1:51:05] said go gather yourselves out there
[1:51:08] sanctify yourselves against tomorrow and
[1:51:11] get ready for you'll see the glory of
[1:51:13] God and he knowed that God was with him
[1:51:17] and he took the priest and watched his
[1:51:19] next statement and he put God first
[1:51:27] he took the priest and he put God first
[1:51:33] what was our opening quote let me see if
[1:51:35] I can find that where did that go
[1:51:37] I'll get it here uh wrong page you know
[1:51:40] what I'm going
[1:51:43] any man woman housewife businessman
[1:51:46] whatever that'll put God first there's
[1:51:48] not enough Devils that can stand against
[1:51:49] him
[1:51:50] hear the children of Israel standing
[1:51:52] there and he puts the Ark in his priests
[1:51:54] in the hands of his priest and they
[1:51:56] begin to walk out through there he says
[1:51:58] brothers and sisters if you put God
[1:51:59] first in anything you do you're bound to
[1:52:02] come out right
[1:52:03] that's all I want to be
[1:52:05] that's all I want to be is right I want
[1:52:08] to put put God first in my life in my
[1:52:11] home in my business in my in my marriage
[1:52:13] and everything I do I want God first and
[1:52:17] everything is going to come out right
[1:52:24] you know when you try to do those things
[1:52:25] God will answer a little little
[1:52:27] blessings little things and and mighty
[1:52:29] ways sometimes
[1:52:32] you know we have facade business that we
[1:52:34] do with those flowers and this just
[1:52:35] comes to me so I'll share it with you
[1:52:38] we had some really nice planners okay
[1:52:41] and uh
[1:52:43] we normally get I don't know
[1:52:46] forty dollars Thirty Thirty forty
[1:52:48] dollars at the sale
[1:52:50] for these planners and so we took a
[1:52:53] bunch down there
[1:52:54] and we've always tried to pray and make
[1:52:56] sure that God is first in it and you
[1:52:59] know any any business you got any
[1:53:00] business people knows you got challenges
[1:53:01] okay and sometimes those challenges can
[1:53:04] try your patience your nerves
[1:53:07] and so we get a phone call and says hey
[1:53:10] I need you to come pick up these
[1:53:11] planters that you sold on Tuesday this
[1:53:13] was on Thursday
[1:53:15] you should come pick these planners up
[1:53:17] that you saw down here on Tuesday the
[1:53:19] guy I brought them back said they're
[1:53:20] infested with bugs
[1:53:22] I said those planners didn't have no
[1:53:23] bugs huh
[1:53:25] well he says they do he don't want you
[1:53:28] to come get them
[1:53:29] so I go down there of course you know
[1:53:31] I'm disheartened we're having a good
[1:53:32] year and here you got 30 of these things
[1:53:34] down there now and they're going to be
[1:53:36] junk and sure enough when I pull up
[1:53:38] they didn't look the best because he
[1:53:40] just threw them around and and
[1:53:42] speculating what had happened he bought
[1:53:44] more than what he should have and and
[1:53:46] decided he didn't need them all and and
[1:53:48] I had other friends of mine look at them
[1:53:49] and that grow and they said no that's
[1:53:51] that's no reason for you to take those
[1:53:53] back there's no bugs that's eating these
[1:53:55] things up you know these things are
[1:53:56] healthy they're good
[1:53:59] yes
[1:54:01] so mayor something and
[1:54:04] and he'd come back no no I ain't gonna
[1:54:07] split nothing with you okay so I'll take
[1:54:10] them back trying to keep the right
[1:54:11] attitude
[1:54:13] put them back out there start watering
[1:54:15] them inspect them trim them spray them
[1:54:17] trying to do whatever you know
[1:54:19] to make sure nothing's wrong with them
[1:54:22] a few days pass they began to perk up
[1:54:24] where he basically about destroyed them
[1:54:28] and I said well I'm gonna take them back
[1:54:29] down there
[1:54:31] so you know what we did we gather them
[1:54:32] up we took them back to the sale put our
[1:54:35] number on them sold them again
[1:54:37] let me tell you how God takes care of
[1:54:38] you the first time I sold them I think
[1:54:40] they averaged thirty dollars
[1:54:42] second time I took them dinner I think
[1:54:43] they average right at forty dollars
[1:54:46] so do you see it's the little things
[1:54:48] that God does for you
[1:54:50] that a lot of times goes unnoticed if
[1:54:52] you're not careful but if you keep God
[1:54:54] first in your business in your life and
[1:54:56] in your marriage little things that
[1:54:57] build up and says that's what makes you
[1:55:00] successful as a Christian the little
[1:55:03] things
[1:55:04] and he said everything you do keep God
[1:55:07] first they're bound to come out right
[1:55:09] and when you went to packing that Ark he
[1:55:11] said when the priest's feet rested in
[1:55:14] the water
[1:55:16] can you imagine what the scene must have
[1:55:18] been when they packing that Ark and the
[1:55:20] priest's feet rested in the water and he
[1:55:23] said at that time the god rolled back to
[1:55:25] Jordan
[1:55:27] she moved back and he stood as a pillar
[1:55:30] and Israel crossed over on dry land
[1:55:34] and built their camps
[1:55:39] let me just give you a picture of this
[1:55:41] and in our minds we think about a group
[1:55:44] of people walking across a little
[1:55:47] Gap right
[1:55:50] if you read in your Bible it says the
[1:55:52] waters went all the way back and heaped
[1:55:54] up into a town called Adam
[1:55:57] and when you look from where the Jordan
[1:55:59] Crossing was at gilgad all the way out
[1:56:02] to the to the town of Adam that's 20
[1:56:05] miles
[1:56:07] a 20-mile span of a river that was one
[1:56:11] mile wide when the priest stepped in
[1:56:14] with God in the front
[1:56:16] the waters began to push all the way
[1:56:19] back up northward
[1:56:21] and held up and heaped up into a place
[1:56:24] called Adam brothers and sisters they
[1:56:26] didn't walk across on a ballast balance
[1:56:28] beam trying not to step in the mud they
[1:56:31] didn't walk across on a sidewalk they
[1:56:33] walked across on a 20 mile wide Highway
[1:56:37] two million people crossed the Jordan
[1:56:40] River Standing on the Promises of God
[1:56:44] let's say under our feet
[1:56:47] you know both faith and fear are
[1:56:50] contagious
[1:56:52] Joshua's Faith was contagious
[1:56:56] when we when we had baseball all my life
[1:56:59] we would I play baseball and I never was
[1:57:02] afraid to be hit by a baseball just I
[1:57:04] never was afraid
[1:57:06] but if you take a kid that ever gets hit
[1:57:08] with a baseball and comes back to the
[1:57:11] Dugout and tells everybody oh that hurts
[1:57:14] over I'm just I don't ever want to buy
[1:57:17] it again
[1:57:19] that fear becomes contagious
[1:57:22] but on the flip side of that you take
[1:57:24] somebody up there throwing 90 miles an
[1:57:26] hour and you let somebody step into the
[1:57:28] batter's box and rip one down the line
[1:57:30] and hit it as hard as they can that
[1:57:32] becomes contagious too they begin to get
[1:57:35] their confidence up and think man if he
[1:57:37] can hit that guy I can hit that guy and
[1:57:40] let me tell you if God can do for Joshua
[1:57:42] and the children of Israel what he did
[1:57:44] on that day we need to grab a hold of
[1:57:46] that get a little bit contagious about
[1:57:48] it and say I've got courage I've got
[1:57:51] strength and God's promises we will
[1:57:53] succeed
[1:57:55] amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads
[1:57:58] Heavenly Father
[1:58:00] we're thankful this morning for the word
[1:58:01] Lord for the lesson that we've had and
[1:58:04] Joshua and it's in my own life it's been
[1:58:07] such a blessing to study this word out
[1:58:09] and see the history of it but Lord

[1:58:15] you're a God of today
