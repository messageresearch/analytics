[40:52] Ber went through the prayer request
[40:53] already. Amen. So, we'll just go to
[40:55] prayer this time. Brother Caleb, don't
[40:56] you say a prayer over the offering?
[41:16] Man, the time has slipped away from us
[41:17] already. So, we're going to invite
[41:19] brother Brad to come and have his

[41:27] My
[41:29] Jesus, my
[41:32] savior. Lord, there is none like
[41:37] you. All of my
[41:40] days I want to
[41:43] praise the wonders of your
[41:48] mighty love.
[41:53] Oh my
[41:54] [Music]
[41:55] comfort, my
[41:58] shelter, tower of reuge and
[42:02] strength. Let every
[42:05] breath and all that I
[42:08] am. Oh, never cease to
[42:12] [Music]
[42:13] worship
[42:16] you. Shout to the Lord all the earth.
[42:21] Let us
[42:23] sing. Power and majesty praise to the
[42:29] king. Mountains bow down and the seas
[42:34] will roar at the
[42:37] sound of your
[42:41] name. I sing for joy at the works of
[42:46] your hands.
[42:48] Forever I'll love you
[42:51] forever I'll
[42:54] stand. Nothing
[42:57] [Music]
[42:59] compares in
[43:03] you. Nothing compares to the promise I
[43:08] have in
[43:14] you. Amen. Good to be in the house of
[43:16] the Lord. Thank you, Lord. Nothing
[43:18] compares to the promise we have in him.
[43:21] There's no other promise that I can make
[43:23] you a promise. Brother Ber can make you
[43:25] a promise. Anybody in here can make you
[43:27] a promise. But when he makes you a
[43:29] promise, you can stand on that promise.
[43:32] Amen. It's good to be in the house,
[43:34] Lord. Why don't we stand to our feet
[43:35] tonight? We get ready to to go into the
[43:38] word tonight. And I I've got notes just
[43:41] uh just scattered. So y'all bear with
[43:44] me. We're going to take our time. We're
[43:46] just going to see what we would have
[43:47] what the Lord would have in store for
[43:49] us. Okay? Uh because if I prepare if I
[43:52] prepare a sermon and I prepare notes, it
[43:54] usually doesn't go too well. But if he
[43:57] takes control and he steps into shoe
[44:00] leather and he opens hearts and the word
[44:02] goes forth into fertile grounds, then we
[44:05] see the manifestation of the word of
[44:07] God. And that's what we're looking for.
[44:09] So turn in your Bibles if you would to
[44:11] Exodus 14.
[44:14] While you're turning, I'm just going to
[44:16] go ahead and go before the Lord in
[44:17] prayer tonight. Heavenly Father, we just
[44:19] want to tell you how much we love you,
[44:21] how much we thank you for being in the
[44:23] house tonight, Lord, and another
[44:24] opportunity to come and to to open your
[44:27] word and to to share and break the bread
[44:29] of life to each other, Lord, as as we
[44:32] come together as believers of like,
[44:34] precious faith. And Lord, we can do
[44:36] nothing in ourselves only in what you do
[44:38] through us, Father. So, we ask that you
[44:40] would come on the scene tonight in a
[44:41] special way. open the ears of the
[44:42] hearers and open the hearts of the
[44:44] vessels tonight. And Lord, if the word
[44:46] goes forth and just finds one one heart,
[44:49] Lord, we just pray that that would be a
[44:51] blessing, Lord. And that that one
[44:53] person, Lord, but we know that we have
[44:55] needs of many, and we just ask that you
[44:57] would meet each and every need amongst
[44:59] us. We love you with all of our hearts
[45:00] in Jesus name.
[45:03] Amen. Exodus 14. Before we read there, I
[45:08] want to read you this little quote that
[45:09] goes right along with I put it to the
[45:11] side, but it kind of went goes along and
[45:13] then and then I just decided we would
[45:15] share it. It says, "Now, in order to get
[45:17] back to the original, God has to speak
[45:20] again." That's what he does when he
[45:23] gives you new birth. The old life is
[45:25] gone and you're back to the original
[45:27] word of the Lord. You're not you're not
[45:31] in this hybrid into churches. You're not
[45:34] hybrid into denominations. But when God
[45:37] speaks and gives peace and the Holy
[45:40] Spirit, then you're back in the original
[45:43] family of God again. You don't have to
[45:46] be babyed then. You don't have to be
[45:48] baby then because you're a rugged
[45:50] Christian who can stand it. Go to the
[45:52] cross, to the fiery furnace, to the
[45:54] lion's den, or wherever it may be
[45:56] because the word of the living God is
[45:59] burning in your heart and in your soul.
[46:03] That's right. He says, "And all can
[46:05] backslide. all can turn against you and
[46:07] everything else, but that won't stop one
[46:09] thing. That rugged word of God stays
[46:12] right there when he spoke that original
[46:15] voice into your heart and said, "You are
[46:19] mine."
[46:22] We've had church.
[46:25] Exodus chapter
[46:28] 14. For Pharaoh will say of the children
[46:32] of Israel, they are entangled in the
[46:36] land. Isn't that the way Satan comes and
[46:38] he thinks about you sometimes that
[46:39] you're entangled in this world? You're
[46:41] entangled in the land and he's got you
[46:43] in a trap and he's got you shut in right
[46:45] there. That's the way he did right here
[46:47] with the children of Israel. They're
[46:48] entangled in a land and the wilderness
[46:51] has them shut shut them in. And I will
[46:54] harden Pharaoh's hearts that he shall
[46:56] follow after them. And I will be honored
[46:59] upon Pharaoh and upon all his host that
[47:03] the Egyptians may know that I am the
[47:07] Lord.
[47:08] Now when God tells you something like
[47:10] that, he means
[47:13] business. And they did so. And it was
[47:15] told the king of Egypt that the people
[47:17] fled and the heart of Pharaoh and the
[47:20] servants was turned against the people.
[47:22] And they said, "Why have we done this
[47:24] that we have let Israel go from serving
[47:27] us?" Isn't that the way Satan
[47:29] does? You overcome, you God does
[47:32] something, delivers you, and and he has
[47:34] no more reigns on you, and then all of a
[47:36] sudden, he says, "Why have we done this?
[47:38] Why have we let them go? Why have we let
[47:40] them go back into into serving God? Why
[47:42] have we give them back their happiness?
[47:44] Why have we let them have?" But Satan
[47:46] can be on the trail, but God's promise
[47:48] says, "He don't have to have you." Come
[47:50] on. Listen to what it says. He made
[47:53] ready his chariots and took his people
[47:55] with him. And he took 600 chosen
[47:57] chariots. Satan's mad.
[48:02] When the people of God have deliverance,
[48:05] when the people of God have the Holy
[48:07] Ghost moving in their midst, when the
[48:10] children of God are no longer shackled
[48:12] by the bondage of Satan,
[48:15] chariots are coming after you.
[48:19] That's right. 600 chariots and the
[48:21] chariots of Egypt, captains over every
[48:23] one of them. And the Lord hardened the
[48:25] heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and
[48:27] pursued after the children of Israel.
[48:29] And the children of Israel went out with
[48:31] a high hand. Now, I never had read that
[48:34] before. Went out with a high hand. I
[48:35] thought, my goodness, what in the world
[48:37] does that mean? So, I looked it up. It
[48:38] means they left out with a boldness of
[48:41] action. They left out with a
[48:44] determination. And they left out with a
[48:46] defined attitude. In other words, by
[48:48] Pharaoh, by Satan, you don't have us no
[48:52] more. Our shackles have been set free.
[48:54] We're no longer under the under the rule
[48:57] of the task masters. We're no longer
[48:59] making bricks. We defy you, Satan.
[49:05] Well, that's the way we get sometimes,
[49:06] ain't it? We get fired up. We get ready
[49:09] to go. The Lord's moving. Man, there
[49:11] ain't enough devils in hell to stop us.
[49:16] The Egyptians pursued after them with
[49:18] horses and chariots, and Pharaoh and his
[49:20] horsemen, and the army overtook them and
[49:22] camping by the sea. Verse 10. And
[49:24] Pharaoh drew nigh, and the children of
[49:26] Israel lifted up their eyes.
[49:29] Uh-oh.
[49:31] Uh-oh. Think about this now. Here we
[49:33] are, a a defiant people, a people who
[49:35] just left out and told them, "Good
[49:37] riddens, Pharaoh. You don't have us no
[49:39] more." But now they've lifted up their
[49:40] eyes, and the Egyptians marched after
[49:43] them. And now their demeanor has turned
[49:45] to soar,
[49:47] afraid, and they cried unto the Lord,
[49:49] and they said unto Moses. Now watch how
[49:52] this watch how this happens. Immediately
[49:54] they started blaming
[49:57] Moses. It's your fault. Because there
[50:00] were no graves in Egypt, that thou hast
[50:02] taken us away to die in the wilderness.
[50:04] Wherefore was thou dealt with us to
[50:07] carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this
[50:10] the word that we did tell you in Egypt,
[50:12] saying, Let us alone. Let us serve the
[50:14] Egyptians. For it had been better for us
[50:17] to serve the Egyptians than it would be
[50:18] to die in the
[50:20] wilderness. So here now is this group of
[50:22] people that are now in the heat of the
[50:25] battle.
[50:26] They're in the heat of the moment, in
[50:28] the heat of the battle, and they're
[50:29] standing there and they're instead of
[50:31] standing up on the word of God and
[50:34] standing up on the promises of God and
[50:36] believing that God promised was true,
[50:39] that there is a land beyond the river.
[50:42] They begin to go back and they turn to
[50:44] the lies of an oppressor.
[50:51] I think if I saw 10 plagues take place,
[50:54] one after another after another after
[50:56] another, and every time God spoke,
[50:59] something happened. Every time God
[51:00] spoke, he delivered. Every time God
[51:02] spoke,
[51:07] so every time God speaks, every time God
[51:10] delivers. Every time there's a miracle,
[51:15] but yet they turn to the lies of the
[51:16] oppressor,
[51:20] task masters back into the lives of
[51:24] bondage. But I want you to watch Moses
[51:26] here. Watch out as he carries out the
[51:28] orders of the Lord. You know, Moses was
[51:29] not
[51:30] wavered. Moses wasn't shook. He didn't
[51:34] get out there and he didn't start to
[51:35] quiver and panic and worry and get into
[51:37] disarray. No, he stood there and he
[51:39] stood right up on the word of God. And
[51:41] he's called out to the people and he
[51:43] said, "Fear ye not. Stand still and see
[51:46] the salvation of the Lord which he will
[51:48] show you today." For the Egyptians,
[51:52] watch for the Egyptians whom you have
[51:55] seen today, you shall see them again no
[51:58] more forever.
[52:01] The sin that once played you, you will
[52:03] see it no more forever.
[52:07] The darkness that overshadowed your
[52:08] life, you will see it no more forever.
[52:12] [Applause]
[52:16] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Why
[52:18] Christ speak unto the children that they
[52:20] go forward?
[52:23] Quit worrying and go forward.
[52:26] Lift up thy rod, stretch out thy hand
[52:28] over the sea, and divide it. And the
[52:29] children shall go on dry dry ground
[52:32] through the midst of the
[52:33] sea." Verse verse 18. And the Egyptians
[52:37] shall know that I am the Lord
[52:42] when I have gotten my
[52:45] honor upon Pharaoh. Ain't it ain't it a
[52:49] good feeling when you can put your foot
[52:50] on the devil's head and say, "I got my
[52:53] honor on you."
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:57] You may have your seats. May the Lord
[52:58] add his blessings to the reading of the
[52:59] word.
[53:03] The prophet says, "Now, we've had many
[53:04] great battles against our enemy, and God
[53:07] has had great men out there standing at
[53:09] the front who has been able to capture
[53:11] by the spirit of God the thoughts of the
[53:14] people and to throw it into the kingdom
[53:16] of God, yonder, and come out
[53:18] victorious." You see, we we can have
[53:21] victorious lives tonight because we have
[53:23] a victorious message. There was a
[53:25] victorious messenger sent to us to
[53:28] deliver the word of God in this hour
[53:30] that we shall be overcomers in the hour
[53:34] that we're living in. But he says we
[53:36] fight it every day. We fight it every
[53:40] day. Every Christian fights a battle
[53:42] every day. And we're in that warfare
[53:45] right now constantly
[53:48] battling between us, right and wrong.
[53:53] This is a battle that each and every one
[53:54] of us face. If you're a human and you're
[53:56] breathing and you got blood running
[53:57] through your veins, you fight this
[53:59] battle on a dayto-day basis. And he
[54:02] says, we battle. Should we receive it?
[54:04] Shall we do it? Shall we go? Shall we
[54:06] bow to the world? Shall we give up this
[54:08] thought we got? He says, but focus.
[54:12] Focus. He says, focus. Take it from
[54:14] Genesis to Revelations. And because she
[54:17] is thus saith the Lord each time right
[54:20] down through there. Listen what he says.
[54:23] We can't give it up.
[54:28] We've come too far, brother Steve.
[54:31] There's been too many people that has
[54:33] that has given their lives for this
[54:35] gospel. There's been too many men that
[54:37] have given given over and over and and
[54:40] and lost treasures and given things for
[54:42] the for the message of the hour to go
[54:44] forth around the world and reach people
[54:47] in remote places.
[54:51] We can't give it up. We can't compromise
[54:55] with the rest of them. We just can't do
[54:57] it. We got to stay right here. No matter
[55:00] how great the enemy is, no matter how
[55:01] much machinery he's got against us,
[55:05] And you think about that. He's got every
[55:08] gun pointed at you.
[55:11] Every weapon he's got, he's pointing it
[55:13] at you. And he's coming after you. Why?
[55:16] Because you are the living, breathing
[55:19] word of God for this hour.
[55:26] But focus on God's word. He says, it
[55:29] don't make any difference what anyone
[55:31] else says.
[55:33] He says, "They say the days of miracles
[55:35] is passed." It don't make any
[55:37] difference.
[55:39] They say that that you can't have the
[55:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It don't make
[55:44] any difference.
[55:46] They say you can't have your healing. It
[55:47] don't make any difference. Why? Because
[55:50] we stand on the promises of God.
[55:55] So, we're in this warfare. He said, "And
[55:57] God's heroes always has this warfare.
[56:00] And you little church, I like it when he
[56:02] calls out the little church. And you
[56:05] little church, remember back there, you
[56:07] are a part of this unit.
[56:11] You're not here by chance. You're not
[56:13] here just by circumstance, but you are
[56:15] part of the unit of God who is marching
[56:17] and fighting and pressing the battle in
[56:20] this last hour. You are part of that
[56:23] union. You are an outpost here.
[56:28] He says, "What's your
[56:30] job? What is your job as a part of this
[56:32] unit to being a part of this outpost?
[56:34] It's your job to keep the banners high,
[56:37] to do what's right, to claim Jesus as
[56:40] the only hope of the world." Brothers
[56:43] and sisters, I have no hope outside of
[56:45] Jesus Christ. You have no hope outside
[56:48] of Jesus Christ. Your children have no
[56:50] hope outside of Jesus Christ.
[56:55] Thank you, Lord.
[56:58] I didn't give you my
[57:01] title. Get ahead of
[57:03] myself. I want to speak tonight on the
[57:06] contending
[57:07] father. Yeah. The contending father.
[57:10] Last week we Wednesday we spoke on the
[57:12] contending believer. So let's look at
[57:13] tonight at a different angle. The
[57:15] contending father. Because we know as
[57:18] Christians and what we know, we know we
[57:19] have to fight. that there is nothing in
[57:22] this life as a life of a Christian that
[57:25] is going to come easy. But you're going
[57:27] to have to have grit. You're going to
[57:29] have to be rugged. You're going to have
[57:31] to be solid. You can't be hybrid with
[57:34] the word. And the prophet begins to
[57:36] break this down and he tells us and he's
[57:39] looking at this and he's looking at the
[57:40] condition of the church world. And he
[57:43] tells us now, he says, "In another 20
[57:45] years, if they don't keep this people
[57:48] from eating this hybrid stuff, corn and
[57:51] wheat, listen what he says. Corn and
[57:53] wheat and stuff like that, they're high
[57:56] breeding. It's changing the posture of
[57:58] women so that in 20 years they won't be
[58:01] able to have
[58:03] babies. It's killing generations.
[58:08] It hasn't got the good stuff in it.
[58:12] Man is not made like they used to be.
[58:14] Now listen what he's saying. Man is not
[58:16] made like they used to be. Look at a man
[58:18] today. Why he used to be that when we
[58:20] played ball games it was rough. He said
[58:23] now they have to wear helmets.
[58:28] Them men was men.
[58:30] They bashing heads. They would fight
[58:33] round after round after round in a ring.
[58:36] 10, 20, 30 rounds until somebody was
[58:39] knocked out. Why? Because they wasn't on
[58:42] the hybrid diet.
[58:44] I look back even at myself. I look at my
[58:47] dad at 72 years old and I look at how he
[58:50] can work and he can work and he can go
[58:52] and he can go. And I told Joyce, I said,
[58:54] "I hope I can do that when I'm 72." She
[58:56] said, "I wish you could do it now.
[59:12] But what is it he's doing? He's trying
[59:13] to make a point
[59:15] here. Be quiet over there. I see
[59:19] you. But he's trying to make a point.
[59:22] And he's trying to make a point here
[59:24] that the high breeding has not only got
[59:26] into the human body, but it has gotten
[59:28] into the spiritual side when it entered
[59:30] into the church. So now this high
[59:33] breeding has got into the church. And he
[59:35] says instead of having real rugged a
[59:38] real rugged bunch of believers, they've
[59:40] hybrid it into denominations
[59:43] and they say I got to have this and I
[59:45] got to have that and I belong to this
[59:47] and I belong to that. They're hybrid in
[59:50] such a way that it can't produce itself
[59:52] again. Right?
[59:56] You know, you once you change the
[59:59] seed, let's say once you change the
[1:00:04] word, it can never do what the original
[1:00:07] did. That's right.
[1:00:13] These farmers raised us GMO
[1:00:16] corn, genetically
[1:00:18] modified corn, wheat,
[1:00:21] beans, and you know, it looks good for a
[1:00:25] while. It looks real strong. It looks
[1:00:27] real good. It looks real healthy, man.
[1:00:29] The ears will be so long and they're
[1:00:31] they're they're two or three inches
[1:00:32] longer than than what the uh original
[1:00:34] corn is. and they're bigger and they're
[1:00:36] fatter and they got they got more
[1:00:37] kernels than you can imagine. And you
[1:00:39] know, they plant that that one year and
[1:00:41] they get one huge harvest and yield off
[1:00:44] of it. And that's the way the people do
[1:00:46] when they when they when they hybridize
[1:00:48] the
[1:00:49] churches. They get a big movement all of
[1:00:51] a sudden and it looks good and it looks
[1:00:55] big and it looks glamorous.
[1:00:57] But as it begins to go forward year
[1:01:00] after year after year, it begins to get
[1:01:02] smaller and smaller and smaller until it
[1:01:05] can't produce anything. There's no
[1:01:07] vitamins in the corn. The corn that
[1:01:09] would had 160 kernels of corn on it now
[1:01:12] is down to 70. The bugs begin to eat it
[1:01:16] up.
[1:01:18] Yeah. You take an heirloom seed, you
[1:01:21] don't have to spray for bugs. Am I
[1:01:23] right, Brother Steve? He's a gardener.
[1:01:25] He knows what I'm talking about. But if
[1:01:27] you want a tomato that will produce a
[1:01:29] tomato that looks the same year after
[1:01:31] year after year after year after year,
[1:01:34] you got to get a heirloom seed. It's
[1:01:37] something that hasn't been mixed with
[1:01:38] anything else.
[1:01:43] Thank you, Lord. But here we see the
[1:01:45] church world has gotten into a place to
[1:01:48] where they're
[1:01:49] mixing and
[1:01:51] hybrid. So there's no way they can
[1:01:53] produce the power, the demonstration,
[1:01:57] the works, the life.
[1:02:00] That's right.
[1:02:04] But he says, "What we need is a book of
[1:02:06] Acts again."
[1:02:08] And the only way you're going to get it
[1:02:09] is to get back to the Bible, back and
[1:02:12] get away from some hybrid religion.
[1:02:15] Amen. He's talking about a books of
[1:02:17] Acts, not a Pentecostal religion, but
[1:02:20] he's talking about a Pentecostal
[1:02:22] experience.
[1:02:24] A Pentecostal religion will let you
[1:02:26] down. A dress code will let you down.
[1:02:31] A dance will let you down.
[1:02:39] But what we're talking about is a move.
[1:02:42] It's a Pentecostal experience that when
[1:02:44] the Holy Ghost comes down and the Holy
[1:02:46] Ghost gets into the lives of his
[1:02:48] believers, into the lives of young men
[1:02:50] and young women and the believers around
[1:02:52] the church, when that Holy Ghost falls
[1:02:54] down in here on fertile ground, there's
[1:02:56] something that begins to spring forth.
[1:02:59] I tell brother Steve, we were talking
[1:03:00] about our meetings and we were standing
[1:03:03] out there. I think we were talking about
[1:03:04] the Saturday night meeting. He said,
[1:03:06] "You know, it kind of reminds me of the
[1:03:07] old Pentecostal years ago.
[1:03:11] how people were free, how people could
[1:03:14] dance, how people could shout. And I
[1:03:16] said, "Yeah, but you know the one
[1:03:17] difference that I found." And I said,
[1:03:19] "We've got something to shout about."
[1:03:22] Because it was the word went forth
[1:03:24] first. It wasn't some man up here
[1:03:26] working up an emotion. It wasn't some
[1:03:29] man up here ramping up the music and
[1:03:31] saying, "You got to dance. You got to
[1:03:32] dance. You got to shout." But it was a
[1:03:34] man bringing forth the word of God under
[1:03:37] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that
[1:03:39] struck down on the inside of the
[1:03:41] believers and it identified who you was
[1:03:44] in the word. Then you can shout. Then
[1:03:46] you can dance. Then you can praise.
[1:03:49] That's the Pentecostal experience we're
[1:03:51] talking
[1:03:54] about. You're a Christian because you're
[1:03:57] born in the spirit of Christ and the
[1:03:58] word of God lives in you.
[1:04:04] I've
[1:04:05] witnessed in the last little bit I
[1:04:08] witnessed what some of this watered down
[1:04:10] Christianity
[1:04:13] produces.
[1:04:15] Yeah.
[1:04:17] Denominationalism. It's a form of
[1:04:21] godliness, but there's no power.
[1:04:24] It's not good.
[1:04:27] It makes it makes men pick up feminine
[1:04:31] spirits.
[1:04:32] And it makes women pick up masculine
[1:04:35] spirits. You say, "Man, why are you
[1:04:37] going down this road?" Stay with
[1:04:44] me. What is it that makes a woman want
[1:04:47] to act like a man that wants to get up
[1:04:50] here and sweat and preach and take
[1:04:54] authority over the pull
[1:04:57] pit? Well, it's quiet.
[1:05:00] What is it that makes her What is it
[1:05:02] that makes her want to to uh to to to
[1:05:04] usurp authority?
[1:05:10] Come on, church. They've
[1:05:13] hybrid. They've hybrid. Now, I'm going
[1:05:16] to bring it down and tell you where a
[1:05:17] lot of that started.
[1:05:19] It started by
[1:05:21] weak, backboneless men,
[1:05:26] who wouldn't go to church, who wouldn't
[1:05:28] take their kids to church, who wouldn't
[1:05:31] who wouldn't take their wives, who
[1:05:32] wouldn't be men. They were they were
[1:05:34] acting like any way they wanted to, and
[1:05:36] they wasn't following the word of God.
[1:05:37] So, the women felt like they had to step
[1:05:39] up.
[1:05:46] I'm not talking about around here now.
[1:05:48] I'm not talking about around our ranks,
[1:05:49] but I'm talking about what he was
[1:05:50] talking about in the world. So, you
[1:05:51] watch how this
[1:05:53] goes. You say, "Why?" Well, these these
[1:05:56] churches, they preach love, love, love,
[1:06:00] happiness, happiness, joy, joy,
[1:06:03] forgiveness,
[1:06:04] forgiveness. And you know, that all does
[1:06:06] have a major part that it plays in
[1:06:10] Christianity. But, Brother Brandham said
[1:06:12] a a real Christian was a rugged person.
[1:06:19] Not everything can be love, love, love.
[1:06:21] If you going to be love, love, love,
[1:06:22] love, you're going to be pushed over,
[1:06:23] pushed over, pushed
[1:06:27] over. They don't preach
[1:06:30] correction. They can't preach serpent
[1:06:33] seed. They'll get thrown
[1:06:34] out. They can't preach godhead. They get
[1:06:37] thrown out.
[1:06:39] Soft. You see how the hybrid religion
[1:06:42] begins to filter in and that's filtered
[1:06:44] into the world. was filtered into the
[1:06:46] culture. They preached the love so much
[1:06:49] to the to the young men began to get m
[1:06:51] feminine. We were at a a thing for
[1:06:54] Carson get an awards
[1:06:58] thing. I don't want to give too much
[1:07:00] detail because it's kind of shameful to
[1:07:02] even be telling it. But but they call up
[1:07:05] different different kids to come up and
[1:07:07] speak and tell about graduating seniors,
[1:07:09] this that and the other. And this this
[1:07:11] this two
[1:07:14] times these young men, they come I can't
[1:07:18] even do it. I can't even do it.
[1:07:22] They come sacheing.
[1:07:30] Up to the
[1:07:32] podium and I'm thinking, what in the
[1:07:34] world is all that twist
[1:07:37] about? and everything is so h
[1:07:45] they go to church every Sunday. They go
[1:07:48] to Sunday school every
[1:07:51] Sunday. They sing in the choir every
[1:07:54] Sunday. They do mission work every day,
[1:07:57] every year. They have an outreach going.
[1:08:00] But what is it? It's that nature that
[1:08:03] has that has been twisted and hybridized
[1:08:07] that they have no backbone to stand up
[1:08:10] and say what is right, what is wrong and
[1:08:12] and and everything is just forgiveness.
[1:08:14] And they say, "Oh, well, it's just God.
[1:08:16] He sees the outward, not the outward,
[1:08:18] but the
[1:08:20] inward." It don't matter what it looks
[1:08:22] like on the outside.
[1:08:29] The word I read says by their fruits.
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:34] It says by their fruits is how you shall
[1:08:36] know them. So whatever it is on the
[1:08:37] inside, that's what has to c come and
[1:08:40] push itself out to the outside. So if
[1:08:43] you've got love in your life, you're
[1:08:44] going to love your neighbor.
[1:08:47] And if you've got holiness in your life,
[1:08:48] a woman, you're going to dress modest.
[1:08:52] If the love of God is on the inside and
[1:08:54] the Christ is living on the inside,
[1:08:56] you're going to act decent.
[1:09:00] But you're also going to fight for
[1:09:01] what's right.
[1:09:06] He says, "We need another book of Acts."
[1:09:08] Again, what we need, brothers and
[1:09:10] sisters, is young men, young ladies,
[1:09:12] believers that are filled with the Holy
[1:09:13] Ghost, that have that genuine personal
[1:09:16] experience with God, and that their
[1:09:18] lives produce the power and the
[1:09:20] demonstration and the work of God no
[1:09:22] matter what it takes.
[1:09:24] You know, he talks about Peter
[1:09:27] Cartwright. You've heard him talk about
[1:09:29] Peter Cartright.
[1:09:31] There's a
[1:09:32] book of Peter Cartwright, the backwoods
[1:09:36] preacher. We need some more backwoods
[1:09:38] preachers.
[1:09:41] Peter Cartwright was born in Virginia,
[1:09:43] pretty close to where brother Ron
[1:09:44] Spencer lives. That's where he was born
[1:09:47] and raised. He then he settled and
[1:09:48] pioneered his family come into Kentucky
[1:09:51] and he comes on into Kentucky down here
[1:09:53] and he begins to to start a work in a
[1:09:55] ministry in a in in his younger years
[1:09:59] and he finds himself settled in Logan
[1:10:02] County. Didn't know that, huh?
[1:10:05] So Peter Cartwright for years begins to
[1:10:08] preach through the southern part of
[1:10:10] Kentucky, right into Tennessee,
[1:10:12] Kentucky. And he is a Methodist
[1:10:13] evangelist that is setting the world on
[1:10:16] fire. Why? Because he preaches with
[1:10:19] authority. He preaches the word of God.
[1:10:22] He preaches Pentecostalism the way it
[1:10:24] was on the book of Acts.
[1:10:26] He wasn't a pushover. And the prophet
[1:10:30] tells that he was sitting there that day
[1:10:31] and he went into that city and he was
[1:10:32] washing the windows. You know the story.
[1:10:34] And the drunk man comes up to him and
[1:10:37] says says, "What are you doing here?"
[1:10:40] And he says, "I'm I'm going to hold a
[1:10:42] meeting." And he said, "Who told you
[1:10:44] to?" And he said, "The Lord told me
[1:10:48] to." And he said, "The prophet said that
[1:10:50] man pulled his coat back and showed a a
[1:10:52] six shooter on his hip and said, "You're
[1:10:54] going to have to whip me first."
[1:11:01] Well, I forgive you, brother. That's
[1:11:02] okay. I'll just pack my bags and I'll go
[1:11:04] to the next city.
[1:11:07] No, no. He stood on the word of God and
[1:11:10] what God had told him to do. And he
[1:11:12] said, "Well, if that's my next job, then
[1:11:14] well, all right." So, he said he undone
[1:11:16] his coat and he said he jumped up on
[1:11:18] that man and beat him and got on the top
[1:11:20] of him and beat him in the face and
[1:11:21] said, "If I must fight, if I should
[1:11:24] reign, increase my courage, Lord, have
[1:11:27] you had enough?"
[1:11:29] When's the last time you balled up on
[1:11:31] the devil and said, "Satan, have you had
[1:11:33] enough? Have you had enough of me?"
[1:11:41] He said, "Have you had enough?" And the
[1:11:42] guy said,
[1:11:44] "Yep." He said he shook his hand and he
[1:11:47] come back and he led him to the Lord.
[1:11:49] Amen. That's right.
[1:11:52] But if he would have cowed
[1:11:54] down and just left the little town. But
[1:11:57] prophet said no. He said what we need is
[1:11:59] more people to do some fighting. Not
[1:12:01] with your fist but with the power of God
[1:12:04] and with your testimony. That's how you
[1:12:06] overcome is by the blood of the lamb and
[1:12:08] your testimony.
[1:12:10] Live your life and be the testimony.
[1:12:12] Tell the devil if he's got strings tied
[1:12:15] to you, you've put this disease on me,
[1:12:18] but Jesus Christ delivered me from it.
[1:12:21] He promised it to me.
[1:12:29] Man, time flies on Wednesday
[1:12:31] night. It's okay. I'm not going to hold
[1:12:34] you like I did last week. I'd run
[1:12:36] everybody off. Look at shoot a shotgun
[1:12:37] out here tonight.
[1:12:46] You're a Christian because you're born
[1:12:47] in the
[1:12:48] spirit. Let's get back to the children
[1:12:50] of Israel for a minute. The children of
[1:12:52] Israel. Now, God tells the children of
[1:12:54] Israel, you go and you camp by the
[1:13:00] sea. And now to the eyes of
[1:13:03] many, you would look at that situation,
[1:13:06] you would say, "My goodness, God does
[1:13:07] not know what he's doing.
[1:13:10] He's got them camped up here against the
[1:13:12] sea. He's pressed them into the sea.
[1:13:14] Pharaoh's coming down their side. The
[1:13:16] wilderness is on both sides and
[1:13:17] Pharaoh's coming up their back. And it
[1:13:19] looks like he's leading them into a dead
[1:13:21] end street. Then the prophet said the
[1:13:23] only way they could get out was the way
[1:13:24] they came in.
[1:13:29] But did Moses question God?
[1:13:32] I didn't read it anywhere where Moses
[1:13:34] questioned God. Moses didn't question
[1:13:37] God. Moses obeyed God.
[1:13:39] And as Moses obeyed God, brothers and
[1:13:42] sisters, God knew what he was doing. God
[1:13:44] knows what he's doing in your life.
[1:13:46] Sometimes you may feel like your back's
[1:13:48] against the wall, but God may be setting
[1:13:50] up a trap for the devil.
[1:13:53] Here, the children of Israel was nowhere
[1:13:55] to go. And we can look at it today and
[1:13:57] say, "God set an ambush for Pharaoh."
[1:14:03] Lord, God knew the change in Pharaoh's
[1:14:06] heart wasn't going to stick. He knew
[1:14:08] that Pharaoh was going to figure out
[1:14:10] what had happened. He knew Pharaoh was
[1:14:12] going to get angry and mad and going to
[1:14:14] want to come after the children of
[1:14:15] Israel. So, he put them in a place that
[1:14:18] they had to depend on God.
[1:14:22] They had to depend on God and put them
[1:14:24] into a land and God wanted them to
[1:14:27] believe on him.
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:33] God put the children of Israel to a
[1:14:35] place that they looked confused.
[1:14:38] You ever feel like you're walking in a
[1:14:39] land of confusion? Man, I don't know
[1:14:41] whether to do this. I don't know whether
[1:14:42] to do that. I don't know whether to go
[1:14:43] up. I don't know whether to go. I don't
[1:14:45] know what to do. And here the children
[1:14:46] of Israel wandering around like in
[1:14:48] confusion. All part of God's
[1:14:55] plan. Because Pharaoh looked at this and
[1:14:59] he said, "Look at
[1:15:00] them. We've got
[1:15:02] them. Nowhere to go."
[1:15:06] And Pharaoh begins to come in and creep
[1:15:08] it in on top of them. Pharaoh is angry.
[1:15:12] You would think Pharaoh would have
[1:15:13] learned something from those plagues.
[1:15:17] You would have thought,
[1:15:19] but maybe he thought, well, that was
[1:15:20] God's used all of his power. Aren't you
[1:15:22] thankful for an unlimited power working
[1:15:25] wonder working God?
[1:15:27] You can't exhaust what God can do. You
[1:15:30] can call on him today, tonight,
[1:15:32] tomorrow, next week, next month, next
[1:15:35] year,
[1:15:37] and he's still the same.
[1:15:41] You know, sometimes we think Satan will
[1:15:42] let us go
[1:15:45] easy. We get so so full of excitement
[1:15:50] when God moves in the scene. And man, we
[1:15:52] think Satan, we got you on the run
[1:15:55] now. He's chasing you.
[1:15:58] He's chasing
[1:15:59] you and he's not going to let you go
[1:16:02] easily.
[1:16:04] Remember Pharaoh and Israel. Satan is
[1:16:08] not going to let you go
[1:16:10] easy. And now the children of Israel
[1:16:13] look out here at this scene and they see
[1:16:16] Pharaoh's armies on the on this side and
[1:16:18] the Red Sea on the other. No chance for
[1:16:21] escape. And in a trap they stand.
[1:16:25] It's all in the eyes of the
[1:16:27] beholder. It was a trap, but they seen
[1:16:31] it as a trap for themselves. They
[1:16:33] wondered, "Why, Moses? Why, Moses, did
[1:16:36] you lead us out here?" They begin to cry
[1:16:38] unto the Lord. They begin to cry out,
[1:16:40] and then they go back to Moses, "Were
[1:16:42] there no graves in Egypt that you taken
[1:16:44] us into the
[1:16:46] wilderness?" Their fear made them cry to
[1:16:49] God.
[1:16:51] their their their statement to Moses
[1:16:53] showed they didn't have much faith.
[1:16:56] Yeah, that's right. So, here they go and
[1:16:59] here they looks like they've lost all
[1:17:01] confidence in
[1:17:04] God and here Israel
[1:17:07] is not but a week out of Egypt already
[1:17:12] looking back to the past.
[1:17:14] And we have to be careful as
[1:17:17] believers. This was God's children. This
[1:17:19] was the children of Israel. This was the
[1:17:21] the promised group of people who was
[1:17:23] going to live in the promised land. It
[1:17:25] was theirs to
[1:17:27] have. And then they find themselves
[1:17:29] disappointed in the situation they're in
[1:17:31] and wanting to go back to the past
[1:17:34] thinking that life was better eating
[1:17:35] onions and garlic and under the lives of
[1:17:38] task masters in
[1:17:40] Egypt. A life that they was under for
[1:17:43] 400 years and they want to go back to
[1:17:44] it. Then why didn't you just leave us
[1:17:46] there, Moses? We told you just let us
[1:17:48] serve
[1:17:51] Pharaoh. You know how insane that
[1:17:54] sounds?
[1:17:55] It would be just like somebody coming
[1:17:57] here and say, "I don't want to serve
[1:17:58] God. Just let us serve
[1:18:05] Satan." And Moses looks at him and Moses
[1:18:09] looks at him and he don't really know
[1:18:10] how God is going to help this situation.
[1:18:13] But one thing that Moses knows, he knows
[1:18:15] that he certainly would help. Moses
[1:18:18] knows that it's a bad situation and God
[1:18:20] will see him through it. And he's
[1:18:23] looking out there that day and he says,
[1:18:24] "Stand
[1:18:27] still." We need to find ourselves in
[1:18:29] that place from time to
[1:18:31] time. Stand still.
[1:18:34] Stop. Don't panic.
[1:18:39] You know, a lot of
[1:18:42] times the Lord will bring us into places
[1:18:46] and in a time of crisis, we we
[1:18:49] panic. I've always told my boys, if
[1:18:51] there's ever a bad situation,
[1:18:52] something's going on, some it's an
[1:18:54] emergency, don't panic because if you
[1:18:56] panic, you're going to make it worse.
[1:18:58] You got to you got to stay calm. You got
[1:19:00] to think, you've got to see what what
[1:19:02] you got to do to make things to fix
[1:19:04] things, to get things back on track.
[1:19:06] Don't panic. And now Moses looks at him
[1:19:07] and he says, "Don't
[1:19:10] panic." And a lot of times we find
[1:19:12] ourselves get in
[1:19:14] despair. Now look at the children of
[1:19:16] Israel. They've found themselves into a
[1:19:18] place of despair. And despair will cast
[1:19:20] you down. It'll keep you from standing.
[1:19:23] Despair beats you down and makes you go
[1:19:25] down and say, "I just can't do this.
[1:19:28] I just can't get through this. I don't
[1:19:30] know how I'm going to make
[1:19:31] it." There was the children of
[1:19:34] Israel. You've led us here. Moses, how
[1:19:37] are we going to make it? Look what
[1:19:38] you've done. We would have been better
[1:19:40] off in Egypt.
[1:19:43] Despair.
[1:19:46] Fear. You know what fear does? Fear
[1:19:48] makes you
[1:19:52] retreat. When David stood out there and
[1:19:54] he faced that
[1:19:56] giant, do you think there was a little
[1:19:58] bit of a a question in his mind as he
[1:20:01] looks up at that big monster?
[1:20:04] But if he would have if he would have
[1:20:05] had
[1:20:06] fear, he would have retreated.
[1:20:09] There's no retreat in the believer
[1:20:12] standing up on the word of God. David
[1:20:14] knew who he was. He knew he was going to
[1:20:16] be the next king. He knew that that big
[1:20:19] giant of a of a a Goliath out there was
[1:20:21] defi trying to defy the children of
[1:20:23] Israel.
[1:20:25] He wasn't going to stand back and watch
[1:20:26] that. So the fear wasn't there. There
[1:20:28] was no retreat in him. We can't have any
[1:20:30] retreat in us.
[1:20:33] As we stand against the challenges of
[1:20:35] Satan, no fear.
[1:20:39] If they would have got
[1:20:41] impatient, impatience will make you do
[1:20:43] things you shouldn't do.
[1:20:48] If they were
[1:20:49] presumptuous. If they would have
[1:20:51] presumed, you know what would have
[1:20:53] happened? If they would have presumed
[1:20:54] our only way out is to cross the river,
[1:20:57] to cross the sea, they would have jumped
[1:20:59] in before the before the highway was
[1:21:01] made.
[1:21:03] Who would have drowned
[1:21:07] then? Stand still.
[1:21:12] Don't presume things in panic
[1:21:16] times. You
[1:21:20] know, my brother-in-law Bruce one time
[1:21:23] he he took a group family down there to
[1:21:25] Florida. And I thought about this when
[1:21:27] it's come to me. He took them down there
[1:21:28] to Florida. They going to go to one of
[1:21:29] them
[1:21:31] parasails out there in the middle of the
[1:21:35] ocean. They went up. The guy took him. I
[1:21:38] think it was Charity up on that parasel.
[1:21:42] Well, you know they tell you, "You want
[1:21:43] me to dip your toes in the water?"
[1:21:45] "Yeah, sure. Let's have a fun time." So,
[1:21:48] he brings them down to dip their toes in
[1:21:49] the water and he just pulls them
[1:21:51] underneath the water. Blah blah blah
[1:21:54] blah. About drowned her. She's coughing
[1:21:57] and choking. So he gets a little bit
[1:21:58] upset and tells the guy, "Take us back.
[1:22:01] We're done with this trip." He says,
[1:22:03] "No, I got other people. We ain't going
[1:22:04] back." So he says, "Well, it don't look
[1:22:06] that far to the shore. I'll swim back."
[1:22:10] Boy, was he
[1:22:12] wrong. Let me tell you, the the distance
[1:22:15] on water don't look nothing like it does
[1:22:17] on the
[1:22:18] highway. He could see those buildings
[1:22:21] miles
[1:22:23] away. He begins to swim and swim and
[1:22:26] swim. He gets tiredder and tiredder and
[1:22:28] tiredder and he barely makes it back to
[1:22:31] the
[1:22:33] beach because he was presuming that that
[1:22:37] was his best route out. It about took
[1:22:40] him
[1:22:41] out. Don't presume. Stand
[1:22:45] still. Stand still and see what God will
[1:22:47] do in the situations.
[1:22:50] You know, the prophet tells us that God
[1:22:52] likes to show his
[1:22:53] power. And then he changed what he said.
[1:22:55] He said, "Not that he has to, but he
[1:22:58] loves to do it."
[1:23:01] You want to talk about a contending
[1:23:03] father, a father who will contend for
[1:23:05] his children. He said he likes to do it.
[1:23:07] It pleases him in his omnipotence to let
[1:23:10] his subjects know who he is.
[1:23:17] Because he shows his power. God shows
[1:23:20] his power regardless of what people will
[1:23:22] think about it. People will clatter to
[1:23:24] it every time. It prepares their hearts.
[1:23:26] It makes them ready. It makes them brace
[1:23:28] up and ready to take on a new hold. Now
[1:23:30] listen what he says. People who doesn't
[1:23:32] believe in divine healing and performing
[1:23:34] of miracles, how no wonder our churches
[1:23:36] are dying. No wonder they're withering
[1:23:38] up to bloodless cults. No wonder social
[1:23:41] gospel is so predominating
[1:23:44] today because our seminaries and
[1:23:47] everything were taking the phenomenal
[1:23:49] away from God.
[1:23:53] stand still and watch the phenomenal. He
[1:23:56] says because God himself is phenomenal.
[1:24:01] He's a creator being. He's a Jehovah.
[1:24:04] He's the reality.
[1:24:07] You know, so much of the world we live
[1:24:09] in is
[1:24:10] unseen. Do you realize that there's more
[1:24:12] that's going on around us that we don't
[1:24:14] see than you'll ever see with your eyes.
[1:24:19] But God is the reality of that
[1:24:22] situation. God is the reality. He's the
[1:24:24] substance of everything made on earth.
[1:24:26] He displays his power by raising the sun
[1:24:29] every morning. Think about this. This is
[1:24:31] the power of a God we serve. He shows
[1:24:34] himself power by raising the sun every
[1:24:36] morning, sending forth his rain, and
[1:24:38] setting the rainbows. Then he comes down
[1:24:42] to his
[1:24:43] subjects. All of that was in the unseen.
[1:24:46] He's moving this and setting this and
[1:24:48] sitting over here at
[1:24:50] rainbow. And then he comes down to his
[1:24:54] subjects and healing their sickness.
[1:25:00] You didn't see
[1:25:02] it. You didn't feel it. But Sister
[1:25:05] Donna, you believed it.
[1:25:07] It's faith. She was standing standing on
[1:25:11] the word of God, believing the promise.
[1:25:12] And he's saving people from their sins.
[1:25:15] That is the contending father fighting
[1:25:17] for his children. God is not going to
[1:25:19] let you lose. We win.
[1:25:23] [Applause]
[1:25:26] He stands in the midst of your storm. He
[1:25:28] stands in the midst of your trials and
[1:25:30] in your in your test. And he's there
[1:25:31] fighting during your sickness. Amen.
[1:25:36] Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:39] He may not move every mountain out of
[1:25:40] the way.
[1:25:44] He may not part every sea before you,
[1:25:47] but one thing he'll do is he'll give you
[1:25:49] the strength to get over it or through
[1:25:51] it, around it, under it. One way or the
[1:25:54] other, God is going to prove himself.
[1:25:57] So the mountain may seem big to you. It
[1:25:59] may seem like it's going to overtake,
[1:26:00] but God will get you through that.
[1:26:05] You listen to this story.
[1:26:09] Sometimes we have to we have to stand
[1:26:13] and we have to stand for what we know to
[1:26:14] be truth. We have to stand for what we
[1:26:16] know to be right. We have to stand and
[1:26:19] let God perform his
[1:26:22] works. And just like the children of
[1:26:24] Israel backed into the corner, sometimes
[1:26:25] God does things in a mysterious way.
[1:26:28] About 150 years ago during the Welsh
[1:26:32] revival, there was a missionary that
[1:26:35] come out of that and a lot of the
[1:26:36] missionaries went into the and into
[1:26:38] India to spread the gospel. And and the
[1:26:41] the the missionary goes into this to
[1:26:43] this region that had hundreds of tribes
[1:26:45] that were primitive. They were head
[1:26:47] hunters, you might say, cannibals, head
[1:26:50] hunters. And he goes in there and he
[1:26:53] begins to into this hostile and
[1:26:54] aggressive communities. and he he comes
[1:26:56] out there and he begins to spreading the
[1:26:58] message of the gospel and he begins to
[1:27:00] talk about Jesus Christ and he wasn't
[1:27:03] welcomed. He wasn't welcomed at all. As
[1:27:06] a matter of fact, he began to spread in
[1:27:08] the the the the gospel more and more and
[1:27:10] the village chief got so angry and he
[1:27:13] summons the villagers and he said,
[1:27:14] "Bring him to me and bring his
[1:27:18] family." And he stands there before the
[1:27:21] village chief of this head
[1:27:23] hunters. And the chief looks at him and
[1:27:26] he
[1:27:26] says,"I will begin to execute you one by
[1:27:30] one if you don't renounce Jesus
[1:27:36] Christ. I will put an arrow through your
[1:27:39] children's
[1:27:41] heart." And he says, "Will you renounce
[1:27:45] Jesus Christ?"
[1:27:48] And he says,"I have decided to follow
[1:27:51] Jesus."
[1:27:53] You ever heard that lyric before?
[1:27:56] I have decided to follow
[1:28:00] Jesus.
[1:28:03] Angry, enraged by the what he heard, the
[1:28:06] chief looks at his archers and he says,
[1:28:07] "Shoot his two
[1:28:10] boys right through the
[1:28:13] hearts." And they lay on the ground
[1:28:16] twitching, gasping for their breath, the
[1:28:18] last li the last little bit of life in
[1:28:20] them. And he says, "Now will you deny
[1:28:23] your faith? You've lost both of your
[1:28:25] boys. I'll shoot your wife,
[1:28:27] too." And he said, "Though none go with
[1:28:31] me, still I will follow." Amen.
[1:28:36] The chief pulls his back out of fury,
[1:28:40] shoots his wife right through the heart,
[1:28:42] arrowed down right there to join her,
[1:28:44] two boys in death. And he said, "I'll
[1:28:48] give you one more opportunity to deny
[1:28:50] your faith and live." And in the face of
[1:28:53] death, he looks and he says, "The cross
[1:28:55] before me, the world behind me, no
[1:28:59] turning back." That's right.
[1:29:02] No turning back.
[1:29:04] Amen. Shot and pierced. Died right
[1:29:08] there. You think, man, that's a cruel
[1:29:10] way to go. That's a terrible way to go.
[1:29:12] That's how could God allow such as that?
[1:29:14] It's not for us to question God. Moses
[1:29:17] didn't question God. We shouldn't
[1:29:18] question God. Because what happened was
[1:29:20] that chief, he thought, "My
[1:29:23] goodness, what kind of God does this man
[1:29:26] serve? a God from over 2,000 years ago
[1:29:29] that he's willing to stand and watch his
[1:29:31] children shot, his wife shot, and
[1:29:33] himself shot. I want to know more about
[1:29:35] this
[1:29:38] God. The chief began to research. The
[1:29:40] chief began to read. The chief began to
[1:29:43] look and in a spontaneous confession as
[1:29:46] he read the word of God, he says, "I too
[1:29:48] belong to Jesus Christ."
[1:29:51] He led the entire cannibalistic
[1:29:55] headunting village to Christ.
[1:29:58] Hallelujah.
[1:30:00] [Applause]
[1:30:06] Was that missionary? Was that him doing
[1:30:08] that?
[1:30:10] You and I as humans, we can't do that.
[1:30:13] We can't sit there and watch our
[1:30:15] children be shot and slain as a human.
[1:30:19] But with the anointing of the Holy
[1:30:21] Ghost, the boldness of God Almighty, an
[1:30:25] entire village was
[1:30:27] changed. Brother Brandham talks about
[1:30:30] Moses and he said there was that man
[1:30:31] that had been schooled. He had been
[1:30:32] trained in wisdom. He was schooled and
[1:30:34] he had all the knowledge that he could,
[1:30:36] had all the degrees so smart that he
[1:30:38] could have taught the
[1:30:40] Egyptians. And as he's looking out
[1:30:42] there, as he's going about his business
[1:30:44] as a young man, he found himself as a
[1:30:47] coward.
[1:30:50] You see, it's not
[1:30:51] man. Man runs.
[1:30:55] You and I run. But it's the God in us
[1:30:58] that fights. He said there was Moses
[1:31:01] that was a coward and running and
[1:31:02] hurting sheep. But there was a time that
[1:31:04] he come to a place that Moses had to
[1:31:07] meet God. And in the midst of a burning
[1:31:09] bush, he looked and he met God right
[1:31:11] there and face to face with God. He
[1:31:13] couldn't be the same anymore. Why?
[1:31:15] Because God was now in him.
[1:31:19] And the prophet said it didn't change
[1:31:21] only Moses. It changed Israel. It
[1:31:23] changed Egypt. It changed the world
[1:31:25] because no one man can meet God and be
[1:31:29] the same.
[1:31:33] God is our fighter. God is our
[1:31:35] contender.
[1:31:37] We look at Joshua. Joshua begins there
[1:31:39] and he comes in there and he's he sees
[1:31:40] all this in the past. And Joshua comes
[1:31:42] up and God tells him, "Moses, my
[1:31:44] servant, is
[1:31:45] dead. But now it's you, Joshua. It's
[1:31:48] you, Joshua, that has to go into the
[1:31:50] promised land. It's you, Joshua, that
[1:31:52] has to carry on." And what does he tell
[1:31:54] him? No man all the days of your life
[1:31:57] will be able to stand before you because
[1:31:59] as I was with Moses,
[1:32:03] so will I be with you. Fear not. Be
[1:32:05] strong and be very courageous. And that
[1:32:07] is God's message to us in this hour. As
[1:32:10] I was with Moses, as I was with Joshua,
[1:32:12] as I was with Daniel, as I was with
[1:32:14] David, as I was with brother Brandham,
[1:32:16] as I was with Paul, as I was with this
[1:32:19] brother and that brother, I will be with
[1:32:21] you. He doesn't change. It's the same
[1:32:23] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:32:27] Thank you, Lord. And Joshua was standing
[1:32:29] there trying to figure out how am I
[1:32:30] going to get across this river? And he
[1:32:32] sees the ark. And he sees the ark over
[1:32:35] there and he begins to look and he says,
[1:32:37] "Priest, get the ark." And as the ark
[1:32:40] began to enter into the water, the
[1:32:41] waters begin to part and Joshua begins
[1:32:43] to walk
[1:32:45] over. You know, I always thought that
[1:32:47] was the end of the story, but there's
[1:32:48] more to it. It's it's it's more to that
[1:32:51] story. As Joshua is standing there two
[1:32:53] or three days later, now he's trying to
[1:32:54] figure out how are we going to take down
[1:32:55] the walls of Jericho. And Joshua is
[1:32:58] sitting there and he's looking and he's
[1:32:59] looking across this muddy water. And
[1:33:02] he's looking trying to figure out what
[1:33:03] he's going to do. And then here's a man
[1:33:05] walking and comes before him and draws a
[1:33:11] sword. And he looks at him and he says,
[1:33:14] "Who are you? Are you for us or are you
[1:33:16] for our
[1:33:20] enemies?
[1:33:22] Nay, nay, but I'm the captain of the
[1:33:25] host of the Lord." Take off your shoes,
[1:33:29] for the ground that you stand on is holy
[1:33:31] ground. Listen, it wasn't Joshua's
[1:33:33] strength. It wasn't Joshua that brought
[1:33:35] down the walls of Jericho. It was the
[1:33:38] mighty God Almighty that he had come
[1:33:40] face to face with. It was his courage
[1:33:42] was increased by the word of God.
[1:33:52] There was a man in the name of
[1:33:55] Peter and the prophet said he was an old
[1:33:57] rugged
[1:34:00] fisherman. An old rugged fisherman as
[1:34:03] rough as there could be. And you don't
[1:34:06] think about Peter like that, but the
[1:34:07] prophet has a way of putting it into
[1:34:08] perspective. And here's Peter, an old
[1:34:11] fisherman, just as rough and rugged as
[1:34:13] could be. He said he was probably just a
[1:34:15] great big push of a
[1:34:20] bully. And he
[1:34:24] says it was a very good description of
[1:34:26] Peter, the big fisherman, a big bully.
[1:34:29] It was a play he was watching because he
[1:34:31] was a big rugged fella and he didn't
[1:34:33] care for
[1:34:35] nothing. You mean Peter didn't care for
[1:34:37] anything? He lived life nonchalant.
[1:34:40] Didn't care for anybody. Any anything
[1:34:42] didn't bother him. He said he didn't
[1:34:44] care for anything. He didn't even hard
[1:34:46] he didn't even believe hardly anything.
[1:34:49] But the day he met God,
[1:34:52] there's something about when you get in
[1:34:54] that presence of God. From that time
[1:34:57] right there, he became an apostle of the
[1:34:59] Lord Jesus Christ. Saul who was
[1:35:02] traveling carrying letters and holding
[1:35:04] the coats of the men who were killing
[1:35:06] the
[1:35:07] Christians stood there and until the
[1:35:09] light of God come upon
[1:35:12] him and changed his
[1:35:14] life. There's something about when you
[1:35:17] come in contact with God, things begin
[1:35:20] to change.
[1:35:22] Now, this one's for you and we're going
[1:35:24] to close early tonight. When a person
[1:35:27] meets God, something definitely happens.
[1:35:30] Place yourself in this quote
[1:35:33] here. After you become a Christian, then
[1:35:36] you are fortified by the word and any
[1:35:39] promise in the word. Woo. He says,
[1:35:42] didn't know I was going to say that, but
[1:35:44] when you become a Christian, you're
[1:35:45] placed behind the word of God. There's
[1:35:48] your fortress. There's your safety.
[1:35:51] Every promise in that is yours. Only
[1:35:54] thing you have to do is to reach and get
[1:35:56] it and go right on with it.
[1:35:59] How do you know it's going to work? He
[1:36:02] said, "I don't know how it's going to
[1:36:03] work.
[1:36:07] How do you know it's going to work? How
[1:36:09] do you know God is going to do it? How
[1:36:10] do you know what is God going to do?" He
[1:36:12] says, "I don't know how it's going to
[1:36:13] work. I can't explain it. Explain it to
[1:36:16] me. I don't know. The only thing I know
[1:36:18] is that God gave his children the best
[1:36:20] attack they could have."
[1:36:23] Listen now. and the best thing to attack
[1:36:26] with because he knows the working of the
[1:36:29] enemy. He says, "Are you ready? You want
[1:36:32] to know what the best attack is?" And
[1:36:34] he's building the peoples up and he
[1:36:36] says, "Are you ready? Are you ready? The
[1:36:38] word of God is eternal. The word of God
[1:36:42] is the best attack God could give." The
[1:36:44] word of God, God made a promise that
[1:36:46] it's eternal and there's nothing nowhere
[1:36:49] that can stop it.
[1:36:54] The Red Sea could not have refused to
[1:36:57] open for God. Do you realize that?
[1:37:01] The lion in the lion's den could not
[1:37:04] have eaten Daniel.
[1:37:07] The fire in the fiery furnace could not
[1:37:10] have burnt the skin on the three Hebrew
[1:37:12] children. Why? Because it's the word and
[1:37:15] it's eternal and it can't change. He
[1:37:17] said, "You can turn every atom upside
[1:37:19] down and backwards and it will never
[1:37:21] pierce the word of God."
[1:37:26] Now, what is the word of God? And I'm
[1:37:28] closing. The word of God is God
[1:37:32] himself. God gave the believer himself.
[1:37:38] Did you catch that?
[1:37:42] Did you catch that? I'm going to say it
[1:37:43] again because we should have more
[1:37:44] applause. The word of God. What is the
[1:37:47] word of God? The word of God is God
[1:37:49] himself. And God gave the believer
[1:37:52] himself.
[1:37:55] You've been given the word in this hour.
[1:37:58] The word that defeats every enemy. Every
[1:38:00] foe, every mountain has to move on the
[1:38:03] word of God.
[1:38:05] And he's standing out here for his
[1:38:07] children. And what are we scared about?
[1:38:09] What are you scared about? He says, "The
[1:38:11] rapture is sure. The coming is sure.
[1:38:14] Every blessing has been promised is
[1:38:17] yours. It all belongs to us
[1:38:21] as musicians, if you
[1:38:25] come. Isn't it a great thing what God
[1:38:29] has done for us? Isn't it a great thing
[1:38:32] that you look down through and you just
[1:38:33] read some of you hear some of these
[1:38:34] stories and and we we just be able to
[1:38:36] break the word a little bit to build our
[1:38:38] courage, to build our faith, to build
[1:38:39] our strength. How many would say, "Give
[1:38:41] me the courage. Give me the courage.
[1:38:45] Give me the courage of Moses.
[1:38:47] Give me the faith of
[1:38:51] David. God, come and dwell on the inside
[1:38:54] of us.
[1:38:56] Because when the blood was shed on
[1:38:58] Calvary,
[1:38:59] it didn't stop there.
[1:39:02] It didn't stop there. But there was an
[1:39:04] upper room experience where God be to
[1:39:06] divide himself amongst his people. And
[1:39:09] he gave himself to you. He gave the
[1:39:12] believer himself.
[1:39:14] All power be to God. Let's just pray.
[1:39:18] Heavenly Father, let's stand if we would
[1:39:20] as we pray. Heavenly Father, we come to
[1:39:23] tonight, Lord, humbly with this broken
[1:39:25] thought that was delivered, Lord. We
[1:39:27] trust it would have been a a blessing to
[1:39:29] someone tonight, Lord. That it would
[1:39:32] just build our courage, build our faith,
[1:39:34] build our strength in the word tonight,
[1:39:36] Lord, as we know it's only by you and
[1:39:38] it's by your word that we can stand and
[1:39:40] we can survive. As we've looked at the
[1:39:42] children of Israel tonight and we see
[1:39:44] how they wavered after such a defiant
[1:39:47] stance against Pharaoh, help us not to
[1:39:49] to waver on our defiance of Satan. Help
[1:39:53] us to stand firm and fa stand strong and
[1:39:55] and to to be able to fight the ws of the
[1:39:58] devil. But the word of God that's been
[1:40:00] delivered to us as God has poured
[1:40:01] himself out into his believers. Help us
[1:40:04] to stand with courage, with faith, with
[1:40:07] deliverance, with freedom. Help us to
[1:40:09] stand boldly upon the word of God. And
[1:40:12] we as we draw our two-edged sword, the
[1:40:15] word of God, and we can slay every demon
[1:40:17] that comes before us.
[1:40:19] Give us that strength and that
[1:40:21] boldness. We love you, Lord, with all of
[1:40:24] our hearts. Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:27] Amen. No turning
[1:40:31] back. The cross before
[1:40:35] me. The world behind
[1:40:39] me. The cross before
[1:40:43] me. The world behind me.
[1:40:48] The cross before
[1:40:52] me, the world behind
[1:40:56] me. No turning
[1:41:00] back. No turning
[1:41:04] back. Though none go with
