to see everybody out this morning amen i'll tell you what i don't think we could ask for a better day is this the first sunday isn't it all right well how about it i must be getting younger i'm starting to remember amen you can be seated if you will let's have everybody that has a birthday amen in this month amen you can come up and i think you might feel beyond brother david are you still on it just sounded like i heard it coming through there that you're really easy to hear from back here amen all right all right no problem i can usually hear it all right better troy all right jessica all right micah great month of october isn't that right a happy birthday to you a happy birthday all jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] happy birthday y'all anniversaries who got me married in october amen i know brother brad i think you're in november i think it was opening day i won't forget that so amen i always remember that there's only a few i think brother willie or who else was it in here got it somebody else did it on opening day and so amen that's a good good way to do it right there all right uh anybody else in october no no all right praise the lord god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord amen it's just good the amen i'll tell you how far the lord is certainly good and and certainly has been nice thank you musicians appreciate it amen if you will stand with me amen the lord has um the last few weeks had a little bit different type of messages i guess i think it was lord laid on my heart to speak about how the lord is never in a hurry amen amen and so we took the little quote where brother bam talked about his little trip with that indian guide you know and he was going too fast right and he just slowed down and slowed down and slowed down and he didn't know what kind of a gear he'd have to go into amen but anyway so you know we just have to be patient and not go so fast amen because brother bam said it causes all kinds of things that happened blow ups and whatnot else and then the other one was i think the chain is only strongest at its weakest link amen and we use that with the help of the lord just to take a message from there this morning amen i want to take a thought out of hebrews 12 if you will go to hebrews 12. trust everybody is doing well at this point unless a lot of you really want to have the fall festival uh we probably won't do it just yet if that's all right with you i mean if we still like i really would rather have our sunday school back and things like that you know if we're gonna do that and i don't think the community might be too happy and when with us riding around and everything to being that close together and all and having fellowshipped in and now i'd like to do it but i know the governor still let's ask us to do social distancing as much as possible so i think we ought to honor that as much as possible for a little while yet because we do know it's going around yet isn't that right it's still pretty strong i would have liked for it to have uh subsided a whole lot more than what it has but it's still going strong as you know the president and his wife got it and so you know if they can get it anybody can get it but i know i i guess trump that's why we like him is because he don't stop you know he keeps on going and that's the way a lot of us think and that right we can't stop because of it got to keep going but anyway we do appreciate being able to have services amen and so if that's okay with everybody so all right let's just bow our heads and go before the lord in prayer before we read this word lord jesus we certainly want to approach you first god before reading your word lord jesus and we just want to realize lord jesus as your prophet taught us that anybody can open the bible and read the read but lord it truly does take you to bring out the understanding and place it into our hearts so that we'll be able to receive it lord jesus and truly understand it father so this morning we asked lord jesus for a true understanding father of your word lord jesus and a closer walk with you lord we ask god that you'll just bless this thought i feel once again that you've laid upon my heart to speak lord may you help it lord to bless the people lord and edify the body of christ for that's truly what you have called your fifo ministry to do you have called them to be for the edification of the body of christ lord and we ask god that you would just edify your body this morning lord jesus bless your people as we have gathered and grateful to be able to do so thanking you lord jesus that you've protected lord us from that virus and the way that you have lord we ask god you continue to do so and lord we pray for those that are infected lord and those have received it that you'd heal them lord jesus and touch them in a special way lord the blessed reading of the word meditation of our heart our gathering together lord as we open our hearts and our minds now lord to you and we close our hearts and our mind to the cares of life to the worries of life and the things lord that it's just the cares of life we just want to block it out now and ask and you would just take our hearts and thoughts lord and speak lord through my lips lord jesus words as you once spoken in jesus christ's name amen and amen turn if you will to hebrews the 12th chapter i guess that i'd told you that amen hebrews 12 and we'll repeat read the first eight verses then i will speak to you amen and i want you to notice perhaps while we while we go through this i want you to notice two words because those are the two words that i want to speak on one of them is endurance and the other one is patience endurance and patience amen so that'll be our thoughts on this morning we're foreseeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself least ye be weary and faint in your minds ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despised thou not the chastening of the lord for when nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth and if ye endure chastening god dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if he be without chastisement we're off all are partakers then are you bastards and not sons may god it is blessings to reading words you can be seated this morning praise the lord amen i like what the prophet of god said you know if i just came up here and i just spoke to you and spoke to you and spoke to you and said all kinds of things you know he says but no service is complete without the reading of the scriptures amen because man can say anything in that right but the only way you know that it's really right if it's according to the word of god and so if you do have the reading of the scriptures then i believe that your service is complete in that right because amen that is truly what makes the service it's the word of god amen i have quite a few scriptures i'd like to go to amen and so you just pray for me and also just been a little bit weak the last few days so bear with me i feel fine but just been a little bit weak for some reason amen so now in the 12th chapter of hebrews down here and talks about how that we are to lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us and for some reason paul if you'll notice paul always was talking about amen he liked to use this journey that we're on amen uh he always used to like this as a race in that right he always talked about running a race and so forth over in first corinthians 10 and verse 24 paul says you know he said ye know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptable amen so paula they're talking about comparing this life to a race that we're running amen and so we want to talk about that with the help of the lord and we want to talk about endurance and patience something we're all familiar with but you know we are we are now at the end of the race somebody believes we're kind of coming down to finishing this race amen i mean the race of the whole thing you know and i believe it was brother branham that one place he talked about over in hebrew seed i believe the scripture talked about david without us cannot be made perfect and he says that we they all the saints of the ages past us are waiting on us i mean they were patiently waiting on us to come to the place that we're supposed to be amen amen and then we'll go and and we'll uh you know gain the prize basically because there's a prize that comes with this race that we're running amen but you know i like that first part of that scripture where it says you know looking unto the author and the finisher of our faith amen and so i you know born again son of god of god you know it's not so much that we're afraid of not finishing the race but we know when uh we want to know how to run this race we want to know what it's going to take to finish it because ultimately it isn't uh it isn't about how far you run or how much you run but it's actually it's it's all about getting to the end of the race and what is at the end of that race um and enduring and it takes in a real endurance amen to be able to finish a race i believe it was um jesus mentioned a time or two uh he was talking about a seed that falls in the ground and you know some people receive the word and and boy they just they're so happy about it and they uh with joy you know uh they rejoice in the lord for a while but by and by they're offended you know and and they just go so far and then and then they fall by the wayside and so forth and even jesus talked about basically what we're talking about this morning how that you know you know it's not about that it's about bringing forth a hundred fold or or getting all the way to the end of the race and and finishing and seeing what's on the end of the at the end for the prize and i have a little perhaps a little drama here at the end that i want to bring to you with the help of the lord about what it's going to be like when we uh receive the prize amen now it says looking unto jesus now here and there's another place we also want to talk about job because bible talks about job amen when he talks about the patience of job but it says let us run with patience the race that set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set down before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured he talked about endured such contradiction of sinners against himself at least you be weary and faint in your minds amen amen we see in our day we've seen a lot of people that are actually fainting you know right people are are they're actually passing out they're they're just they can't run the race anymore they just stop running the race and that right some so we see a lot of it but here it says you know and how many knows that if everything is going easy and everything's going good and and you know there's no endurance to that right there's no endurance and there's neither neither is there any patience with that how many knows when you're going down the road and there's no vehicles in front of you and you can just keep your cruise set on 55 and you can keep scrolling keep right on going but when you're heading to clarksville i did several i did this yesterday and you know um it was kind of funny but i would you know you meet these tractors and they'll go a lot slower you know and hey there's curves and you know and anytime i get behind this low person i'm saying lord all right thank you lord i must be i must be needing some patience here you know and uh meeting the trucker big old truck driver he was behind a few cars you know and i kind of pulled over to see how far it is before you know there would be a straight stretch where you could legally pass i pulled on that big old truck he pulled over like you ain't passing you know and uh i said oh honey it is fun to hear you know so all of a sudden i pulled over again he pulls up i was laughing but he was probably not so happy but causing road rage here but you know it's it's the times when there's stress when they're stressed that's when you have to have patience isn't that right amen and that's also where you have to have endurance and i'll tell you what how many believes that we're certainly living in a very stressful age amen and patience people's people do not have patience now my sons will tell you that my shortcoming is when i uh in my shortcoming and my my my most lack of patience is when i'm working all right and i'll tell the boys sometimes hey do this and before they ever get to do it i go do it i'm getting paid i want to get it done now and yesterday already you know and i'd be better off just go do it myself you know because i can't just say go do this and then you know i'm just and i have to pull back and say well just slow down how do you have to do that to yourself say just slow down a little bit more amen so when i preach on slowing down a lot that goes for me 150 amen but you know just to have patience and let me tell you something in order to obtain because the bible talks about obtaining promises through patience amen we have to be paid this is an hour when people are have no patience they don't want to wait on each other in line and there's road rage and all kinds of things you know they just people don't like to wait but how many knows that all the saints of all the ages are actually waiting on us amen it takes patience so look at jesus he says that look at the contradiction of sinners and he talks about how that you know jesus for the sake of reaching his goal he allowed people to false accuse him amen he was spit upon he was called the beelzebub he was rejected and even his disciples left him and he had jesus went through suffering like we could never imagine and notice it wasn't so much just the spear in his side because i probably thought that jesus didn't die from the spirit in his side he was dead before then right amen because he died of a broken heart because the whole world had completely rejected him because people would not receive him and because he was despised and rejected of man he was actually died of a broken heart amen because amen here he displayed all this love and at the very end and he knew he would but the very his own very disciples left him even the last 12 that was with him they all forsook him they all went their ways you know there he was by himself amen but he endured the cross he endured he meant being despised he endured and man being spit upon him it was a it was oh at the garden of gethsemane he prayed and he even if you think about it that even jesus had to pray to the spirit for strength and for overcoming power against his own will and saying not my will but thine be done father it was endurance because if jesus would have not endured he'd just spoke and 12 legions of angels would have come and delivered him and that right he could have done it but he knew that that was not the purpose of god amen he was being being god in flesh he was never going to be overcome by his own by by the flesh part where he says not my will but thine be done if it be possible let this come from it was endurance it was a hard struggle and here if after that if you'll notice so so jesus actually went to the cross he endured amen being false accused lied about amen and receiving capital punishment by the hands of sinners so that's what the bible is telling us here look at jesus look at what he went through amen look at his endurance for the joy amen that was to be able to sit at the right hand of god amen amen of the throne of god so consider him that endured such a contradiction of sinners against himself at least he be weary and faith in your own minds or you haven't went to the cross how many knows we haven't nobody's punched you in the face nobody's cut you nobody spit on you nobody's put you on the cross we haven't actually bled or spilled blood striving against sin but yet jesus lost his very life striving against sin amen and he endured that's what paul said look at him look at what he did striving against sin and look at the endurance that he had so if you know what want to know what kind of endurance that you're supposed to have jesus is your example how many believe that this morning jesus is our example when it comes to endurance and even jesus one place that he that endureth unto the end shall be saved i want to talk to you a little bit about what actually gives us that ability to endure because how many knows it's just not a self-will there has to be something in here that gives you the ability to endure amen and then he kind of goes on in a second part here that we'll just pick up for a minute because it talks about the chastening of the lord and being rebuked of the lord now over in revelations i don't have the scriptures pulled out and so forth but we realize that jesus said there in the third chapter of revelations as many as i love i rebuke and chasten so how many knows rebuking being rebuked of the lord and being chastised or corrected by the lord amen it takes endurance to go through that because if you can't take the correction of the lord remember you're not his son and if you are a son of god you are going to receive chastisement you are going to receive correction you're going to get rebuked because i love you amen because he just doesn't simply allow you to come into heaven with all of your wrong and believe me we have plenty of wrong our first birth was wrong our first nature was wrong amen the fruit of the flesh the bible talks about is witchcraft idolatry and invariance immolation wrath strife these all these things it's the fruit of the flesh amen and that has to be purged that has to be cleaned is that right we have to put on a new nature but it's given us by the holy ghost amen and then you have righteousness peace joy long suffering gentleness meekness and and temperance and patience and godliness all of these things over here virtue strength all of these come from us that's what god wants you to have and so all those other things have to be taken out of you if they are in you remember god he's going to come at you he's going to come keep coming at you look this has to be dealt with i got to deal with this on you and that right and sometimes it hurts i'll tell you what i don't think any kid loves to get a woman no it hurts not just not just uh the whooping hurts but the humiliation of having to need a woman and being talked to what's wrong with you son don't you know any better and being humiliated a little bit you know and then a whooping on top of it well i'll tell you what i mean they have a real way of getting the frowns going down why because it goes against the flesh it's hard on the flesh but even the bible says the next verse didn't our fathers according to the flesh you know correctness you know and they did it for the pleasure of the father but it says that this god does it to us for our own good amen when god corrects us it's usually pretty strong it's usually pretty hard amen and it takes a real son of god a real daughter of god to be able to take that rebuke to take that chastisement it takes both patience and endurance you must endure the correction of god if you're gonna be his child if you aren't going to take his correction you remember you're none of his you're a bastard child the bible calls you amen so we look at that and then i'm going to look at another one over in james turn with me to james if you would to james let's go to james 1 and then we'll go to i'm going to james 1 my brethren verse 2 count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience wow so whenever you have a trial it's not just to test your faith is that right but it's to bring another something else into your life that's patience amen so the trying of your faith it works patience and then it says and let patience have her perfect work that you may be in that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing hallelujah this just comes to mind i trust it'll be a blessing but you know whenever you're going through something and and you're being tried and and and that product of patience is coming forth most of the time listen most of the time where we fail is during that trial [Music] during the test of our trial we fail because why we lack patience to go through that trial trusting god amen and then guess what that means you never learn patience but let me say this let's say that you go through this trial of your faith amen and you patiently wait isn't it right they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength isn't that right they shall renew their strength and by and then what if you can make it and patiently make it through a trial next trial a comeback guess what you'll patiently and you'll that you'll be the product that god is looking for to live with him let it have its perfect work that you might be entire lacking nothing because if you fail in the middle of the trial you didn't pass the test you got to take it over and that right so if you didn't bring what it's supposed to do the tests and the trials count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations and trial boy oh boy as our human nature says brother i cannot say that i enjoy that isn't that right how many can say boy i'll tell you i counted all joy when i had real trials and deaths come my way huh but what did james say counted all joy in that acts i just read let me just read you let me just read you something real quick like acts 14 i didn't write the uh i didn't write it down okay i had quite a few yeah here it is didn't write it down but i found it confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in faith all right and that we must through much tribulation enter the kingdom amen let me tell you something tribulation it's just a natural part of a believer and we don't understand it here in laodicea like they did with paul in them paul and them and the early disciples they knew what it was like until they even put it in the bible that look you're going to have to go through much tribulation to enter the kingdom much trials more tests a whole lot of that it's going to take for you to actually enter into the kingdom james said count it all joy when you fall into a diverse temptation knowing this trying of your faith workers patience let it have a perfect work that you may be entire amen lacking nothing praise the lord so i just thought of that i thought lord help us amen let it have its perfect work because amen we're going to have to be patient in this now most of us know that we've actually we have been looking for the coming of the lord amen and we most message people have expected we're expecting at least very much before uh 1977 my father-in-law promised my my wife that if that the lord don't come before 77 i'll buy you lowers all right she'll go get a horse out of the deal if god didn't come in 77. yeah that's how much they were relying on they believed because of what brother bannon said he thought that the ushering in of the millennium what happened by 1977. and here we are 2 000 and what 20. amen so i'll tell you what how many knows it's taken a lot of patience it takes patience it takes endurance amen praise the lord and it takes being able to go through things to let the lord work on us to give us patience how many this morning you know that you need more patience i know i do lord help me to have more patience because i'll maybe this just comes to my mind better john if you have patience you have endurance because you can't have patience without having endurance because patience is enduring things and that right amen all right let's go to another one now we'll go to james five james five a lot of scripture about endurance and patience james 5 and we'll begin with verse 7. be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord and i want to i'm going to touch the end of the service perhaps try to come back to this seventh verse but and dwell on that a little bit be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husband husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and had long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also so he's saying god is patient am i right how many is god's patient now he says next verse be also patient establish your for the coming of the lord draweth nigh hallelujah now how many knows paul peter all of those brothers they expected the coming of the lord to be anytime even in their age and here we are 2 000 years later talk about patience isn't that right that's right for the coming of the lord throughout the night grudge not on against another brother at least ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience how many knows that we're really living an hour where people cannot take very much people cannot take very much they can't handle very much amen oh my so now notice verse 11 take them for an example of suffering affliction patience behold we kill them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of job all right now that's all it says that's all it says about job but i want to talk a little bit more about him but i'm going to talk about the second half of the scripture also and have seen the end of the lord right it goes right back to what paul said in hebrews about look at what the lord went through you have seen the end of the lord and the things he endured the patience that he had right the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy and he goes to talk about something else but let's talk about this other part he said you have heard of the patience of job now notice james said amen counted all joy when you for a fall in diverse temptations amen whom the lord lord loveth he scourges he rebukes he chastens with long suffering and gentleness how many knows that was exactly what god allowed job to go through job allowed i mean god allowed job to suffer look at what job went through he lost his children he lost his stock he lost his farm he lost his animals you know the animals and all that's one thing but all of his children in the house and they all collapsed down now how many would say that's it that i'm done god huh my religion must be wrong you're you know you're not a great god huh how many knows that that's what the temptation that brother branham had amen when god took his wife and his child he devil couldn't tell him there ain't no god he knew there was a god but he said he don't love you in other words he's a mean god you know what and brother branham that is in himself he felt that coming down if that's how god's going to be huh but he didn't never say it he says the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord how many know that took patience that took endurance and he had to have something out of here to be able to endure amen and job he had to endure he was an endurance how many of his wife didn't really pass the test did she his wife didn't really pass the test she says that's it joe just curse god and die just get it over with this is enough i ain't got no more patience she didn't have any more patience encouraged him but job had long patience i mean is when somebody smacks you on the cheek it takes patience somebody does you wrong it takes patience because if you don't have patience you're going to lose it you're right never going to work if you don't have patience amen that's right that's why he says you know if somebody takes you to court and give by choose you for your coat give him your own coat overcoat also that if you go on some of these go go for mile go with me from go with him two miles have extra patience you got to have patience to be a christians you got to have endurance if you're going to make it amen endurance praise the lord endurance of joke the patience of job the end of the lord amen now let's go to the next one found over in romans 5 romans 5 basically just bears this same thing out it says pretty much the same thing therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into disgrace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only so hello but we also glory in tribulation also let me just say what comes to my mind is that all right maybe we'll be where we're supposed to be when something bad comes that we can actually say thank you lord huh thank you lord because i know you got this i know this is for my good because remember this nothing is allowed to come into your life nothing is allowed to happen to you without permission from god first people can't do nothing to you unless you've got permission so if something comes your way if we say lord i know you must give permission for this to happen to me whatever it might be sickness disease neighbors yelling at well i don't care just anything right anything comes your way it's allowed and when you get to the place to say thank you lord i know you must have seen that i could take this thank you jesus man we glory we we oh my being justified by faith we have peace with god by whom we also have access into this grace we're in restoring and rejoice which rejoice in this hope see this morning's message is a lot of things can be said i've preached many a message that'll make you feel good it'll make you shout it'll make you run up and down the aisle and everything else but this morning it's geared against about endurance and patience it's not really that type of service huh because when you talk about the place that job went the place that brother branham went the place said brother branham said god takes all of his children down to that place to where you're either going to serve god or you're not we all come to that place sooner or later in our life we come down to that nitty gritty to where look we're either going to say boys that ain't right i can't do this or we're going to say the lord gives the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord he brings us all to that testing testing ground but paul here again he says the same thing james really did he says we don't just rejoice in the hope of the glory of god but not only that but we also we glory in tribulation also knowing that tribulation worketh patience huh the trial of your faith works patience paul says here that tribulation works patience i'll tell you this right now i i believe that it's i believe it's definitely something that we should see in older people patients they've went through it they've seen it time and again tribulation and and things coming their way doesn't shake them anymore it doesn't rock them amen like it used to and i think i can look at faces on here everywhere i think most of us can say that about ourselves you know those problems that we used to face that used to shake us to the very core they don't shake us like they used to anymore because we have learned to trust god in it i mean we have learned to be patient in it amen somebody else amen gets riled up we don't get riled up yeah we learned that because we used to get it riled up wouldn't take much dwellers up now it takes a whole lot more amen because i know i you know i wish i'll say hey there ain't nothing that'll ever rile me wouldn't that be nice to say that but unless you have went through some extreme things and kept you cool all the way through can't really say that because we're limited and if we aren't really strong in the lord we're limited but now we should be limited amen not we should be unlimited should i say we should be there no matter what it is we just stay steady right in it amen that's i believe why paul said this about tribulation that we are the glory and tribulation because it teaches to be patient just keep patience now now and then most of the time you read this it talks about faith and patience because you're without faith it's hard to be patient you got to have faith and then be patient and then watch god work amen just like the three hebrew children how many knows they had patience you know they that weighed on the lord those that are patiently waiting on the lord the lord didn't come until they went down over the edge no that's not true that is not true right because those soldiers that were taken up to the edge it was so hot that it killed them so i would say that at the beginning of the temperature change from the natural air to where it started to get hot that's where the lord came because they didn't get burnt walking up to it they didn't even get a cinched hair going all the way up to there so the lord was there ready he was there at that temperature he was there and when they went all the way in and thrown in man i wonder how they landed brother man how did they land did the lord how deep was it how deep was the pit how far down because you know they could have landed on their head anyway but i don't think so maya i tend to believe that they had a nice soft landing the lord bore him up just set him down there huh and that big old white hot flames flame shooting out the big big uh uh stove whatever was huge pit whatever it was you know and it says that guess what they were having like me and my wife last few days had a little fire there by the get some logs you know just hit by the fire they was walking around all of them hot fired he says i see the fourth man walking around they were all just walking around enjoying the breeze it's all just fine huh they had patience they waited on the lord and he may not have come to the last minute but he came right on time same way with daniel he had patience on god amen how many believes you've got to be patient on god amen be patient be that weight on the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen praise the lord endurance and haitians all right so it says knowing that tribulation workers patience and patience experience hallelujah i like that word experience since venom talked about going to the hospital and having your maybe a kidney removed or a liver operation something really big and a young guy comes in there looks at me about 25 years old right and you ask him well how many times have you done this he says it's my first time i think i can do this no experience right you know maybe he's watched it many times but he's never had to cut it himself the man says there's an older guy that's standard hundreds of times that's the one i want to do that's the one i want to say all right you cut on me why because he's got experience amen that's a whole lot like preachers and when we were young we cut that knife and man we stabbed and cut we don't do so well but as you get older you learn to cut a little easier am i right and with christians as a general how many knows you you know you get somebody up come go to somebody in one console from them or whatever it is and and you know what do you think about this that or the other and they can tell you well this is what my experience is huh and it'll be good and it's good to get get counsel from father somebody that's got experience and that's what paul said that tribulation work of patience and patience gives you experience amen a little more comes on that talk about david how many knows that david he had an experience on the back side of the desert so when he came to saul amen he says this is my experience amen i've had an experience with the lord and i know that he'll deliver that guy you know and he could tell him of a previous thing that he happened amen with the lion and the bear and then you could have confidence hey this guy knows what he's talking about because he went through the experience how many knows we need that we as christians every one of us this morning need that if you're ever going to lead somebody to the lord if you're ever going to be a witness for christ you have to have experience amen we only get that as the lord allows things to come our way praise the lord all right now one more thing so patient works experience and experience hope amen i actually like the work faith a little better but paul used the word hope because i'll tell you what we know is that when david had the experience of the lion and the bear he had hoped that god would also deliver him or faith that god would also deliver him from the giant amen so he it worked hope it gives you you just know that god is there praise the lord you like that all right that's romans 4. romans 5 i mean sorry let's go to 2nd corinthians 6 now ok this is about approving ourselves approving ourselves and or should i say being approved how many knows the devil got impatient in heaven he didn't like it there anymore he wasn't happy with the situation he got impatient he had no patience he wanted something different i don't know about you but i believe god wants to live with people that have patience all right i wonder i have one here it's in romans 15. okay i've got you in first corinthians do i ii corinthians all right hold that i want to go back to romans 15 romans 15. first i'll tell you the bible talk calls god the god of patience he's the god of patience all right chapter 15 verse 4 for whatsoever things were written before time were written for our learning that we through patience right and comfort of the scriptures might have amen so how many knows do we read these scriptures we read the bibles like we mentioned this morning and we bring it brings us comfort in the scriptures as we look at these people who through patience obtained the promises now might have hope now verse 5 now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one towards another according to christ jesus amen so he calls him the god of patience may con give you consolation now let's go to second corinthians second corinthians 6. we'll begin with verse 4. but on all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience i mean with paul he really had to have a lot of patience didn't he oh my all right approving ourselves notice in much patience in afflictions we prove ourselves in afflictions in necessities he knew what it's like to need things i mean a lot of times that's when we get impatient when we don't get what we want when we don't have something that we want in distresses amen in stripes in imprisonments in in tumults labors watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by long suffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love on frame by the word of truth by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report and good report in other words if definitely say something good about you or bad about you amen as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor but yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things oh ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged so you see paul here saying that we are approved by pray by patience and tribulation necessities god just didn't promise the believer a flowery bit of ease he promised that he would give you things that you have to endure and right now folks how many knows that we're enduring unto the end amen because there's one thing that we're looking for a world where we never get old a world where we never die a world where we never have gray hair a world where we'll never have sickness or death amen eternal life let me believe this surprise is eternal life that's what we're looking for and one of these days we're going to see it in closing i actually have one more scripture and then we'll go back to the closing scripture it's found in hebrews 10. hebrews 10. paul says that ye have need of patience amen there's another one i think it talks about how that we're to follow those who through patience obtained the promises how many of those that's how you get things by being patient you reach your goal you reach your goal by being patient if you're going to florida it's a long haul i don't like that long haul all the way to florida but guess what if i stop in macon i'm never going to get there i get to make it oh is it just too far i can't do it huh no that's the way it is at this christian walk oh it's just too far too hard no i can't make it no you gotta go all the way let me just say this that this is one of the things that i did want to say you know what makes it to where you can endure what makes it that you can endure is if it is what you are amen the pharisees they acted like something they weren't you know right but if christianity and the love of god is in your heart you love it he's more than life to you amen but if somebody doesn't really love the lord isn't really born again guess what you're gonna not gonna be able to endure because the love of it isn't in there it has to be in here amen okay so hebrews 10 and verse 35 it says cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise isn't that the way it's going to work after you've been patient waiting on the coming of the lord amen that you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come amen oh people want to say there ain't no god he ain't coming i'm here to tell you he's going to come he's going to arrive like that woman that little girl amen that was out west and waiting on that young man to come and pick her up they might have said ah he ain't coming to get you he ain't coming to get you she was there at the gate at that day at 12 o'clock and she was waiting for him that's what you and i are doing patiently waiting on the coming of the lord yet a little while he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them that draw back unto partition but of them that believing to the saving of the soul amen let's go to james back to james one james 5 i believe it is where i was reading that i wanted to close with james 5. and verse 7 be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord amen so how many beliefs that's what we're going to have to do just keep steady keep planting your potatoes keep doing what you're doing serving the lord be patient unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman wadeth for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the earlier latter rain so i wanted to talk about that for just a few minutes the lord can you imagine how patient god is huh because brother branham help me note that the saints of this age when you die you go into a certain place about 20 feet up the ramp says when he was in his bed he's seen all of those people they were about to he got he was caught up about 20 feet up into another dimension and there were all the people of this age there but yet he wanted to see the lord and he uh the angel says you can't see him how many knows they don't get to see him until we get to see him because he's up a little higher he's in a in another dimension higher amen on the mercy seat isn't that right he's on that mercy seat interceding for the saints and as long as he's on that inner interceding chair amen uh there's still mercy to be had the last one hasn't come in yet and now how many knows that not just the last 2 000 years but what jesus went to calvary for what he endured the cross for amen he's interceding amen and he's working in every one of our lives how many knows it's the lord working in every one of our lives and he is redeeming us back to himself giving us the holy ghost giving of his spirit but he doesn't actually get to come and physically be with us until the rapture happens now let me ask you something god having before there was one star out there before the first moon or the sun before anything was created god had a plan in his mind all right and here we are at the almost at the very end of the whole plan as far as this universe is concerned because we know god's plan isn't finished we know that there's going to be amen the whole earth is going to fur be burnt with fervent heat all the wick and then it's going to burn up going to be ashes under the soles of your feet there's going to be a millennium we're going to have a millennium title it's not the end of the plan but it's the end of the plan for humanity as we know it it meant for the realm of testing and the realm of molding and shaping us in the image of christ and getting us ready to meet the lord and making us fit to live and rule with him for a thousand years we're almost at the end of that plan right but he has been waiting can we say for 6 000 years the lord has been waiting to what to reap the harvest and to be with you and me hey we want to be with the lord but he wants to be with us can you imagine how much more even so perhaps he wants to be with us because he went and shed his blood for us he paid for the price of our sins to be covered in sins and put in the sea of his forgetfulness and he says he has much patience waiting for that harvest time but he is waiting also to be with you and me he's being real patient that's a lot of patience and i thought when i was writing this i thought how anxious and i know that god ain't anxious but it's the best word i know of to use to try to describe how the lord must feel about wanting to be with us the one that he purchased one that he paid for the one that he's got all of his life i don't know how to describe it other than that little girl that was out west if you remember and the boy had asked her to marry him isn't that right and then he went and built her a home isn't that right he went build her a home and he didn't see her for here for a whole year can you imagine how anxious he was when those horse hooves finally got were hurt coming up over the hills and down through the valleys and they were just coming off that jeep i bet he had them horses on full speed he wanted to go get his wife he wanted to be live with his wife he wanted his wife with him and that's the way god is with us god is looking forward to having us with him and he has certainly been a patient god he is the god of all patients amen and he's looking forward to being with you and me amen how many in your heart say lord help me to be patient until you're coming don't let me get impatient lord and help me to display this patience in my life and in every area of our my life amen how many would say that every area of my life help me lord to display patience be able to go through things and have experience and show experience and have the hope of god resting in my heart god bless you stand with you with me if you will this morning musicians if you'll come god is good isn't he homie just loves him with all your heart amen he certainly is good let's bow our heads talk to him once again lord jesus as we have looked at your precious word lord and we have seen lord in the scriptures where you have pain patience father for waiting for the earlier and the latter rain god and we know that that latter rain has already come we know that it's been the crop has been watered lord jesus and it's bringing forth dear children once more lord lord redeeming us to you lord and on that day lord jesus we just wonder lord and we just imagine father how glorious it is going to be lord to be able to see you face to face and to talk to you personally lord and no doubt but we'll have so many times that we'll be saying thank you lord jesus first of all for saving me lord for the work that you did in my life lord and fulfilling me with that holy ghost lord and for taking me from a life of sin to and giving me hope lord jesus in you and father then all the times lord jesus not only for saving me for for keeping me lord how they will fellowship with you and you'll say yes i didn't mind when you couldn't get up you couldn't get around something lord i helped you through and i'm we'll say yes we know that was you lord he was all in my life lord you sustained us you you were the author and you were the finisher of our faith and what fellowship we'll have with you on that day lord we look forward to seeing you but lord fathers sometimes it seems like the road gets hard seems like it gets long lord jesus we can't do like the saints did before of us just go out there and give our life and have it hand lord and give us our our blood for our testimony and just but lord we have to endure every day lord jesus with evil all around us temptation trials and snares all around us and lord we have to endure father just keep on pressing on perhaps a lifetime for some of us just a lifetime of pressing on lord but it's nothing a greater honor that we could have not a greater privilege that we can do lord but to serve you all the days of our life lord jesus and to be patient unto your coming lord we ask god that you'll bless every heart this morning lord jesus that you'll teach us your patience lord how to be more patient we give you honor and glory lord thank you for your many blessings now in jesus name amen and amen god bless you brother
