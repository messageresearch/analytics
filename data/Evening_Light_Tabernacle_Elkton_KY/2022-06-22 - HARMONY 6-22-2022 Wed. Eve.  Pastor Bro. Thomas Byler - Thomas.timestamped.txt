[1:05:25] amen and amen
[1:05:28] let's just get right into the word if
[1:05:29] you will
[1:05:30] amen we'll go to um
[1:05:35] saint john 5
[1:05:37] saint john 5th chapter
[1:05:50] we'll begin and we'll read about 19
[1:05:52] verses it's a little bit lengthy but
[1:05:54] we'll just read the story
[1:05:55] to try to get a basis for our thought
[1:05:57] tonight
[1:05:59] after this there was a feast
[1:06:02] of the jews and jesus went up to
[1:06:04] jerusalem
[1:06:05] and there was at jerusalem by the sheep
[1:06:08] market a pool which is called in the
[1:06:10] hebrew tongue bethesda
[1:06:13] having five porches
[1:06:14] in these
[1:06:16] lay a great multitude of impotent folk
[1:06:19] blind halt wither waiting for the moving
[1:06:22] of the water
[1:06:24] for an angel went down at a certain sea
[1:06:26] certain season into the pool and
[1:06:28] troubled the water
[1:06:30] whosoever then first after the troubling
[1:06:33] of the water stepped
[1:06:35] in was made whole
[1:06:37] of whatsoever
[1:06:41] and a certain man was there which had an
[1:06:43] infirmity thirty and eight years if
[1:06:46] you'll notice as a prophet but he
[1:06:48] already had it 38 years so he wasn't
[1:06:51] real likely to die of it
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:55] when jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[1:06:57] had been now for a long time in that
[1:06:59] case he said unto him will thou be made
[1:07:02] whole the impotent man answered him sir
[1:07:05] i have no man when the water is troubled
[1:07:07] to put me into the pool but while he
[1:07:10] steps down before me
[1:07:12] i imagine the man was frustrated don't
[1:07:14] you
[1:07:16] yes just about to get your healing and
[1:07:18] then somebody
[1:07:19] isn't kind enough to let you get healed
[1:07:21] they want it bad themselves right
[1:07:24] so they step into it
[1:07:26] amen jesus says unto him rise take up
[1:07:28] thy bed and walk and
[1:07:30] immediately the man was made whole and
[1:07:32] took up his bed and walked
[1:07:34] and on the same day was the sabbath the
[1:07:37] jews therefore said unto him that was
[1:07:39] cured it is the sabbath day it is not
[1:07:41] lawful for thee to carry thy bed
[1:07:44] he answered them
[1:07:46] he answers them that he made me whole
[1:07:50] he that made me whole the same is he
[1:07:51] that said to me take up my bed and walk
[1:07:54] then ask the him what man
[1:07:57] is that which said unto thee take up thy
[1:07:59] bed and walk
[1:08:01] and he that was healed was not who it
[1:08:02] was for jesus had conveyed himself
[1:08:06] away a multitude being in that place
[1:08:09] afterwards jesus findeth him in the
[1:08:11] temple and said unto him behold thou art
[1:08:14] made whole sin no more at least the
[1:08:16] worst thing come upon thee
[1:08:18] the man departed and told the jews that
[1:08:20] it was jesus which had made him whole
[1:08:23] and therefore did the jews persecute
[1:08:25] jesus and sought to slay him
[1:08:27] because he had done these things on the
[1:08:29] sabbath day
[1:08:30] but jesus answered them my father
[1:08:33] worketh neither to and i were
[1:08:36] therefore the jews sought more to kill
[1:08:38] him because he had not only broken
[1:08:39] sabbath but said that god was his father
[1:08:42] making himself equal with god
[1:08:44] then answered jesus and said unto them
[1:08:47] verily verily i say unto you the sun
[1:08:49] can do nothing in himself but what he
[1:08:51] seeth the father do
[1:08:53] for what things so ever he doeth
[1:08:55] these also doeth the son likewise amen
[1:08:58] may god has blessings to the reading of
[1:09:00] the word you can be seated
[1:09:03] amen
[1:09:04] i want to start with making the
[1:09:06] statement that
[1:09:07] even though the pharisees and the
[1:09:09] scribes are the pharisees even though
[1:09:12] they were god's ordained
[1:09:14] children and the church that was
[1:09:16] ordained in the way that it was supposed
[1:09:18] to be
[1:09:19] they couldn't have missed it further
[1:09:21] than what they did amen because here
[1:09:23] somebody that was completely healed and
[1:09:25] made whole here they want to kill the
[1:09:27] man
[1:09:29] they want to kill a man that has the
[1:09:30] power to heal people you know and so it
[1:09:33] had to be an utter blindness isn't that
[1:09:35] right
[1:09:36] they were utterly blind to pharisees
[1:09:38] words
[1:09:39] uh i want to say pathetically blind
[1:09:41] because
[1:09:42] uh i mean we know that in the end
[1:09:44] they're the ones that said away with him
[1:09:46] away with him crucify him crucify him
[1:09:48] and all the things that they did they
[1:09:50] bore false witness against him they did
[1:09:52] everything in the book
[1:09:53] so lord help them amen it goes to show
[1:09:56] you that just because people are
[1:09:57] religious
[1:09:58] doesn't mean that they're in tune with
[1:10:00] god amen praise the lord so we want to
[1:10:03] speak tonight and i don't know we
[1:10:05] already posted on the internet i guess
[1:10:07] i i want to speak on harmony this
[1:10:10] morning as i was just praying about what
[1:10:11] the lord would want me to speak and so
[1:10:13] forth this thought came to my mind and
[1:10:15] my heart and it wouldn't leave
[1:10:17] so that's what i studied on but the help
[1:10:19] of the lord and that is harmony but i
[1:10:21] want to call it rapturing harmony
[1:10:24] rapturing harmony amen because i believe
[1:10:27] it is time for us to be rapture ready
[1:10:29] don't you
[1:10:30] time to leave this world amen if i was
[1:10:33] to ask anybody in the church tonight
[1:10:35] and i have maybe a couple of little
[1:10:37] things maybe
[1:10:38] uh you know that i might try to get you
[1:10:40] to participate in and that is what is
[1:10:43] your goal in life
[1:10:45] what is your goal in life
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:52] make the rapture anything else
[1:10:56] be ready for the rapture to be like
[1:10:58] jesus
[1:10:59] to be more like christ amen but the
[1:11:01] number one thing would be for the
[1:11:03] rapture am i right we know there's not a
[1:11:05] hope left in this world that's the only
[1:11:07] way out of here that's the only escape
[1:11:10] amen
[1:11:11] and in order to make that rapture that's
[1:11:13] what we want to be doing is to get ready
[1:11:15] to be ready for the rapture amen you're
[1:11:17] not
[1:11:18] gonna make it you're not gonna go in the
[1:11:20] rapture if you're not ready for the
[1:11:21] rapture so i believe what we're talking
[1:11:24] about tonight with the help of the lord
[1:11:25] is certainly something that will make us
[1:11:27] ready for the rapture and it's also
[1:11:29] something else that you can pray for
[1:11:31] that you can ask for
[1:11:34] amen and receive it because there's
[1:11:36] things that you can pray for
[1:11:38] amen that you will not receive
[1:11:42] how many knows that many things bible
[1:11:44] says you ask and miss because you ask it
[1:11:46] upon your own lusts and so forth but i
[1:11:49] like what saint john 5 and 14 i believe
[1:11:51] it is
[1:11:52] says uh let me see 5 14. he says and
[1:11:56] this is the confidence that we have in
[1:11:58] him
[1:11:59] you know because we could talk about all
[1:12:01] the places and the things and
[1:12:03] that he said ask what you will and all
[1:12:05] these other places he says whatsoever
[1:12:06] you ask in my name i'll do it but here
[1:12:08] it says
[1:12:09] that if we ask anything according to his
[1:12:13] will
[1:12:15] he hears us
[1:12:17] i may let you gotta pray right
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:21] i'm just going to give you a little bit
[1:12:22] underlying something here i think i've
[1:12:24] experienced this to where i've known of
[1:12:28] people to pray for something and pray
[1:12:30] for something until i've heard back
[1:12:33] again
[1:12:34] uh of other people that have said you
[1:12:35] know this person prayed so hard i don't
[1:12:38] know why it ever didn't happen
[1:12:42] i mean we're talking about godly people
[1:12:43] praying okay that i personally know
[1:12:46] and in my heart in my mind it says in my
[1:12:48] heart i said i bet you anything he
[1:12:50] wasn't according to the will of god
[1:12:53] because you can't pray i don't care how
[1:12:54] safely you can't pray against the will
[1:12:56] of god amen and get your you can't get
[1:12:59] it amen
[1:13:00] because the bible says we get it only
[1:13:02] when you pray according to the will of
[1:13:04] god
[1:13:05] amen now another thought was on this on
[1:13:07] by praying is that when you pray amen
[1:13:10] and you ask the wrong way
[1:13:13] amen you might be like balaam and the
[1:13:15] animal may have to talk to you
[1:13:19] oh my
[1:13:20] it's true you go the wrong way you ask
[1:13:23] for the wrong thing you're going to get
[1:13:25] your foot crushed things are going to go
[1:13:26] bad for you it's not going to go good
[1:13:28] but it's going to go bad but when you
[1:13:30] ask according to his will
[1:13:33] god's going to answer that and that's
[1:13:34] what we're going to talk about tonight
[1:13:35] because what we're wanting to desire is
[1:13:38] to be in harmony with almighty god
[1:13:42] my my mind when i think about harmony oh
[1:13:45] my i just i love harmony i mean he loves
[1:13:48] harmony
[1:13:49] a harmony in a family how nice it is
[1:13:52] and disharmony you know a division
[1:13:55] how horrible it is but harmony when
[1:13:57] everything's working together amen it's
[1:14:00] just like taking a any kind of a tool or
[1:14:03] a
[1:14:04] any kind of a machine that has all kinds
[1:14:06] of gears and everything and i think
[1:14:08] brother branham explained it a little
[1:14:09] bit when he talked about the dynamics
[1:14:11] and
[1:14:13] mechanics of a cadillac now should can
[1:14:15] be in such perfect shape and the motor
[1:14:17] can be absolutely uh you know gold
[1:14:20] plated now it can be a you know a 16
[1:14:22] cylinder or whatever just perfect
[1:14:24] everything perfect the gas tank filled
[1:14:27] everything just right
[1:14:29] isn't it amazing you can look at any
[1:14:31] kind of a machine and just be amazed
[1:14:34] at how it works
[1:14:36] and you know why i guess i've never
[1:14:38] really seen it but i guess in these
[1:14:39] factories where they make cars and
[1:14:41] things uh you know where those uh
[1:14:43] uh what is it called these
[1:14:45] machines robots or whatever you know i
[1:14:48] can only imagine how you would be
[1:14:50] flabbergasted i would be flabbergasted
[1:14:52] at how damn things can do it and
[1:14:54] everything i mean you know every every
[1:14:56] road or every turn everything that makes
[1:14:58] it go right in the right place and just
[1:15:00] the right distance and do just the right
[1:15:02] it's just wow
[1:15:05] you know right but how many knows it's a
[1:15:07] terrible thing when one of them get out
[1:15:09] alive
[1:15:10] and that's the same way with you and me
[1:15:12] brother sister so as long as we are in
[1:15:14] harmony with god it is amazing how
[1:15:17] smooth and how nice it can run
[1:15:20] but when you get out of harmony with god
[1:15:22] i'm here to tell you
[1:15:24] i believe that brethren said that you
[1:15:26] know whenever jesus leaves trouble sets
[1:15:28] in
[1:15:29] you begin to get away from god and just
[1:15:32] watch trouble come
[1:15:36] let that sink in get away from god
[1:15:39] trouble we'll sit in
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:43] it did for david
[1:15:45] david was in harmony he was in such
[1:15:48] harmony with god until he could chase a
[1:15:50] lion down and kill it get his sheep back
[1:15:53] he could take a a bear and kill the bear
[1:15:56] because he took whatever shape
[1:15:58] he could go back and rejoice into a
[1:16:01] dance around the tree and praise be to
[1:16:03] god god is with me i can do all things
[1:16:06] with god he knew he could all he's
[1:16:08] invincible with god
[1:16:11] amen
[1:16:13] and then the giant in that right the
[1:16:15] giant the goliath how did god was with
[1:16:18] him god was with david
[1:16:21] david was nothing but a little cupbearer
[1:16:23] a little food bringer
[1:16:24] isn't that right
[1:16:25] for his dad sending him down there
[1:16:28] taking give my my children my boys some
[1:16:30] videos
[1:16:32] he went there and he seen the middle he
[1:16:34] brought the middles and so forth and
[1:16:36] the brothers yeah
[1:16:38] said you are little rascal
[1:16:40] you just come down here because you want
[1:16:42] to see the battle you want to see some
[1:16:43] blood flying and stuff didn't you
[1:16:46] no you want to see some fighting going
[1:16:47] on crazy stuff yeah yeah that's what you
[1:16:49] came no but he did see the giant
[1:16:53] he did see the giant and he was in such
[1:16:55] harmony with god
[1:16:56] let me tell you something the difference
[1:16:58] between a christian that can get
[1:17:00] something done with god and a christian
[1:17:01] that can't is when god makes it real
[1:17:03] because none of them people come
[1:17:05] volunteering out of those foxholes none
[1:17:07] of his brothers volunteered to go face
[1:17:09] this guy
[1:17:10] and david was the ruddiest of them all
[1:17:12] but when he had it in his heart and he
[1:17:14] seen him define the armies of living god
[1:17:16] he remembered the bear this guy don't
[1:17:19] look as vicious as that lion live with
[1:17:21] his great big teeth
[1:17:22] huh
[1:17:24] no he may be big he may be tall but i
[1:17:26] know this guy can come down and he got
[1:17:28] an inspiration now
[1:17:31] inspired by god
[1:17:33] i can take him down
[1:17:35] he ain't too big
[1:17:37] god's much bigger than he is
[1:17:40] oh boy the scenario of what we have of
[1:17:42] how that he said and he says i'll take
[1:17:44] him you know because he made this big
[1:17:46] boast
[1:17:47] one of y'all come match me if we die if
[1:17:49] if you kill me we'll be your servants if
[1:17:52] we kill him you'll be our servants
[1:17:54] well i wish you didn't have more kings
[1:17:55] like that don't you
[1:17:57] huh let putin and whoever's in go at it
[1:18:00] you know just let them go out there and
[1:18:01] get their best man or whatever just be
[1:18:03] between two men instead of whole armies
[1:18:06] huh
[1:18:08] probably be a whole lot better off
[1:18:09] ukrainians a lot of people lost their
[1:18:12] lives folks
[1:18:13] think about it i think russia's at 34
[1:18:15] 000 men lost or something like that
[1:18:17] that's a lot of lives lost for a little
[1:18:20] puny devilish feud that's all it is it's
[1:18:22] a devil that gets jealous or wants land
[1:18:24] or once more and it's not satisfied and
[1:18:27] you know that's all that is there's a
[1:18:28] bunch of devils operating in in
[1:18:30] indonesians
[1:18:32] now back to my thought let's get back
[1:18:34] off of putin and then will you
[1:18:36] ah lord
[1:18:37] but think about david the harmony that
[1:18:39] he had and he had to go and he
[1:18:41] he challenged him and saul and everybody
[1:18:43] the doubt that went through people's
[1:18:45] mind about this guy
[1:18:48] but i like it you know you know the good
[1:18:50] part about it is he could look in saul's
[1:18:52] face and say saul i'll take that guy and
[1:18:55] i will bring him down i guarantee you
[1:18:58] cause i'll tell you about a bear let me
[1:19:00] tell you about this bear that came in
[1:19:01] the line i can kill them because god is
[1:19:04] with me
[1:19:05] and somehow he convinced saul to let him
[1:19:07] go and of course all put all of his big
[1:19:08] armor on and everything shields and
[1:19:10] swords and everything else and he
[1:19:12] got hidden behind it all he says get
[1:19:14] this stuff all off i mean i haven't
[1:19:16] tried this shielding this sword just let
[1:19:18] me have this little sling i've proven
[1:19:20] that
[1:19:21] isn't that right
[1:19:23] and he went out there and of course he
[1:19:24] killed
[1:19:25] goliath he brought him down and became
[1:19:27] very famous he was such harmony with god
[1:19:31] that god directed that stone
[1:19:34] oh my how many likes to be directed by
[1:19:37] god when god directs you to a job he or
[1:19:40] directs you to this or that or the other
[1:19:43] amen just today just today i always pray
[1:19:45] lord what do you want me to do today and
[1:19:47] he told me what to do and it was you
[1:19:48] know and now i did huh
[1:19:51] you know just every day ask god what god
[1:19:53] wants you to do how many with me you
[1:19:55] know so that god will lead you and guide
[1:19:57] you in everything that you do
[1:19:59] that's how we're supposed to be walk by
[1:20:01] faith walk by faith in god
[1:20:04] what oh harmony when i think about
[1:20:06] harmony i think about armies
[1:20:09] i think about armies
[1:20:11] that you can look and how they're boy
[1:20:14] there when they're marching
[1:20:16] boom
[1:20:20] stepping in harmony why do you come to
[1:20:23] to be unified
[1:20:24] when you think about harmony you think
[1:20:26] about unity think about oneness
[1:20:29] everybody do it in harmony
[1:20:33] and that's what if that's what wins
[1:20:36] battles you've got great walls not
[1:20:37] everybody
[1:20:38] you know it's it's the trouble is and
[1:20:41] defeat comes
[1:20:43] from disarray
[1:20:47] defeat comes from disarray
[1:20:50] that's the way it is with your life you
[1:20:52] want to really get away from god and get
[1:20:53] everything all up get upset and and man
[1:20:56] you don't know what's up what sounds the
[1:20:58] devil's right on there and he's going to
[1:21:00] get you
[1:21:01] he's going to give you a lot of trouble
[1:21:02] but when you're in your prayer you pray
[1:21:03] every morning pray at noon pray at night
[1:21:05] you're tuned with god the devil won't be
[1:21:07] able to get in there
[1:21:09] are you with me
[1:21:10] and you get a church you get a group of
[1:21:12] people like this right here and the only
[1:21:14] way that we'll ever have is a really
[1:21:16] old-fashioned holy ghost beating is when
[1:21:18] everybody gets in the same mind gets of
[1:21:22] one accord of one mind
[1:21:24] how many believes that it takes that
[1:21:26] unity takes that harmony
[1:21:29] if you don't have that harmony
[1:21:32] and it takes god to bring that harmony
[1:21:34] amen
[1:21:36] praise be to god and that's what we
[1:21:38] desire in that harmony
[1:21:40] it's unity to where god can come and
[1:21:42] work whenever god is up here working and
[1:21:44] he's working there something's gonna
[1:21:46] happen
[1:21:48] but when the god is here and he's not
[1:21:50] there
[1:21:52] it's gonna be a quiet service or if it's
[1:21:54] back over there or something can we turn
[1:21:56] this around a little bit let's turn it
[1:21:58] around on the preacher
[1:22:00] you come to church and you're just
[1:22:02] expecting something oh man you're just
[1:22:04] expecting a fireball you're expecting
[1:22:06] god to speak to your heart and the guy
[1:22:07] so backsliddy can't even preach
[1:22:10] huh
[1:22:12] it's not inspired it's just come from
[1:22:14] his mental stuff
[1:22:16] huh you might not get back and you go
[1:22:18] out the door boy i didn't get what i
[1:22:19] expected
[1:22:21] because how many knows that's got to be
[1:22:23] right this is god it takes both
[1:22:26] amen when you say jesus christ died the
[1:22:29] same sinners
[1:22:31] what does the congregation say
[1:22:33] [Music]
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:36] it just takes a unification amen when
[1:22:38] you say god came to sometimes his sons
[1:22:40] and daughters he comes to mold us and
[1:22:43] shape us into his image
[1:22:47] that's better
[1:22:48] think about it it takes both takes
[1:22:50] harmony to bring the holy spirit because
[1:22:53] your holy spirit is not going to go in
[1:22:55] this array
[1:22:56] just like you get a bunch of fuss in a
[1:22:58] fight to the church brother ben says
[1:22:59] holy spirit leave
[1:23:01] you ain't going to have no kind of
[1:23:02] revival whatsoever when people are
[1:23:04] fussing to murmur
[1:23:05] because i'll tell you this right now
[1:23:06] that's out of the will of god when you
[1:23:08] fuss and you remember that is out of the
[1:23:09] will of god
[1:23:15] so what i said to say what to say on
[1:23:17] that was
[1:23:18] the prayer thing
[1:23:21] this is our heart's desire
[1:23:23] our prayer
[1:23:24] is to be more like christ
[1:23:26] how many believe that
[1:23:28] and if you believe in predestination and
[1:23:30] foreknowledge of god god knowing all
[1:23:32] things predestinating all things
[1:23:34] according to
[1:23:35] romans the 8th chapter it says in verse
[1:23:37] 28 he says for we know that all things
[1:23:41] work together for the good
[1:23:45] to them that love god aren't you glad
[1:23:47] for that that's harmony
[1:23:50] promising that god's going to make it
[1:23:52] come out good
[1:23:54] for them that love god to them that who
[1:23:56] are called according to
[1:23:59] how you want to do it
[1:24:01] no his purpose
[1:24:04] for whom he did for no
[1:24:06] i
[1:24:08] he also did predestinate
[1:24:11] oh my
[1:24:12] god knew everything he knew i was going
[1:24:14] to end before it ever started he know
[1:24:16] what's going to happen in the millennium
[1:24:18] he knows the battle of gog and magog
[1:24:20] that's going to go on after the
[1:24:21] millennium he knows when the new city is
[1:24:23] going to come down from heaven as
[1:24:25] adorned as a bride and to a husband in
[1:24:27] revelation he knows everything
[1:24:32] glory
[1:24:34] i hope you're part of it
[1:24:36] so he
[1:24:38] foreign for something and i like this
[1:24:41] and then it's our prayer this is our
[1:24:43] prayer is that we are predestinated to
[1:24:46] be conformed to the image of his son
[1:24:50] now there's a lot of people that i
[1:24:52] wouldn't mind being like brother branham
[1:24:54] is one of them paul's another
[1:24:57] many different ones david they're a
[1:24:58] different one but that number the chief
[1:25:00] one that i want to be like is jesus
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:08] let me tell you something if you aren't
[1:25:10] desiring to be closer to jesus and more
[1:25:12] like jesus then you ain't got enough of
[1:25:14] jesus is what you need to have in your
[1:25:16] heart right now
[1:25:18] because i guarantee you when you get a
[1:25:20] little bit of the holy ghost you want
[1:25:21] more holios when you get to be a little
[1:25:23] more like christ you want more like
[1:25:24] christ it is you know
[1:25:27] i was thinking on the way to church it
[1:25:28] says anything that you have any victory
[1:25:30] that you have or are going to have is
[1:25:31] something that has to be placed in your
[1:25:34] heart to have
[1:25:35] isn't that right god has to put it in
[1:25:37] there otherwise you'll never get victory
[1:25:39] you'll never overcome be able to never
[1:25:40] be a son of god unless god put something
[1:25:42] there to be for you desire to be like
[1:25:44] christ
[1:25:45] and i'll tell you this if you are a son
[1:25:47] of god god automatically predestinated
[1:25:50] he put a desire in your heart to be like
[1:25:52] christ amen
[1:25:55] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:25:59] that he might be the first monk born
[1:26:01] among many brethren
[1:26:03] praise be to god amen
[1:26:07] church age book
[1:26:08] page
[1:26:10] um
[1:26:12] well i got the wrong page let's go to
[1:26:14] the right page first if i can find it
[1:26:16] here it is
[1:26:17] all right this is the
[1:26:19] about the only quote i have i guess
[1:26:21] but this is where i went to after the
[1:26:23] lord showed me about harmony and i began
[1:26:25] to think
[1:26:26] and i came to mind of this quote that
[1:26:28] the prophet god said
[1:26:32] he makes this statement
[1:26:36] notice
[1:26:38] the harmony
[1:26:40] of the father
[1:26:42] and the son
[1:26:44] jesus never did anything until it was
[1:26:47] first showed him
[1:26:48] by the father
[1:26:50] praise be to god
[1:26:52] oh my
[1:26:54] i'm here to tell you we wouldn't have so
[1:26:56] many flops we wouldn't have so many
[1:26:58] disappointments if we would pray about
[1:27:01] everything we did more
[1:27:04] because he did nothing jesus didn't knew
[1:27:06] nothing even brother brennan remember
[1:27:08] one place brother bam talk about how he
[1:27:10] needs to have more faith and just
[1:27:11] believe and i'm always waiting for him
[1:27:13] to do something but if you'll look at
[1:27:15] his ministry and the rest of his life
[1:27:17] you'll find that he went back to just
[1:27:19] doing what the father showed him
[1:27:21] huh
[1:27:23] yeah you got to have faith to move out
[1:27:24] and all that but then
[1:27:26] in the core of it all your heart desires
[1:27:29] whatever god wants me to do that's what
[1:27:31] i want to do because you'll find
[1:27:33] yourself missing
[1:27:34] a lot of times outside of that
[1:27:37] amen
[1:27:40] oh my
[1:27:42] the harmony and notice how that in my
[1:27:44] bible reading tonight if you'll notice
[1:27:46] there was many it says all those porches
[1:27:49] were full of impotent people people who
[1:27:51] are in dire need
[1:27:53] in bad shape and he walked by all of
[1:27:56] them and went to that one man
[1:28:00] and healed him
[1:28:01] and left
[1:28:04] huh
[1:28:06] logically speaking sometimes we don't
[1:28:07] understand why that would be
[1:28:10] amen but jesus just didn't do his own
[1:28:13] thing
[1:28:14] he did what the father showed him
[1:28:18] amen and people wonder well where was
[1:28:19] the father up in heaven where's the
[1:28:21] father at no
[1:28:22] amen peter and them says where's the
[1:28:24] father you keep talking about the father
[1:28:26] show us the father and it'll be it'll
[1:28:28] suffice us
[1:28:31] and jesus says have i been this long
[1:28:33] with you and you still don't know you
[1:28:36] still don't understand let me tell you
[1:28:38] the children out there still don't
[1:28:40] understand about jesus and the father
[1:28:44] he says we are one
[1:28:45] amen when when thomas fell down in front
[1:28:48] of him he says my lord and my god
[1:28:51] amen jesus had to tell him i and my
[1:28:54] father are one if you have seen me you
[1:28:57] have seen the father because the
[1:28:59] fullness of the body the godhead the
[1:29:01] bible says dwelled in him
[1:29:05] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:29:07] he was god was right there and the
[1:29:09] father was the spirit that was in him
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:13] and it was in him and that spirit would
[1:29:15] show him everything
[1:29:17] he would show him the way the same way
[1:29:19] how many believes it's the same way with
[1:29:21] you and i god the holy spirit leading us
[1:29:24] and guiding us
[1:29:27] now i don't know about you but i want to
[1:29:28] be more and more
[1:29:30] sensitive to that spirit
[1:29:33] speaking to me on a daily basis
[1:29:35] i always like to put in my prayer in the
[1:29:37] morning and lord
[1:29:38] fellowship with me today
[1:29:41] speak with me today
[1:29:42] fellowship with me because god desires
[1:29:45] fellowship don't he he loves fellowship
[1:29:47] and then lord help my thick head and my
[1:29:49] busy schedule not to be so much that i
[1:29:52] can't hear you
[1:29:53] when i use
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:57] because when he talks folks i'm here to
[1:29:59] tell you there's nothing like it
[1:30:01] amen so you'll notice the father the
[1:30:03] harmony between the father and the son
[1:30:07] he never did anything until the father
[1:30:08] showed him
[1:30:10] now this is next statement he makes like
[1:30:12] this not truly believe
[1:30:13] that it's true and i just not thought of
[1:30:16] it but i had a scripture
[1:30:18] of how that look jesus loved
[1:30:21] harmony
[1:30:22] jesus loves harmony
[1:30:30] um
[1:30:31] i guess either can i pause
[1:30:33] because another thought came in my mind
[1:30:35] that is the whole universe
[1:30:38] how many knows the whole universe
[1:30:40] the stars the moon
[1:30:43] if the moon come too close it would mess
[1:30:44] everything up if it went a little bit
[1:30:46] too fast it would mess everything up if
[1:30:48] it went behind a little bit it would
[1:30:49] mess things up if these are slowed down
[1:30:51] a little bit it would mess things up
[1:30:53] everything stays right where the word
[1:30:56] put it
[1:30:58] i would love to tell every atheist out
[1:31:00] there if you don't believe in god why
[1:31:02] don't you just look around
[1:31:05] and if you can't see god and know that
[1:31:08] there's a god that makes it everything
[1:31:09] you they know when haley's gone it's
[1:31:11] gonna come back
[1:31:13] they know how many times to come they
[1:31:14] can tell you all that stuff but they
[1:31:16] can't believe it god what is wrong with
[1:31:18] you
[1:31:21] huh and then you try to tell me you're
[1:31:23] smart
[1:31:27] not so much
[1:31:30] if you think that's by chance
[1:31:33] you know well anyway i'll keep my words
[1:31:36] that's not very smart
[1:31:39] praise the lord you love him but the
[1:31:41] universe everything is perfect
[1:31:43] perfect harmony
[1:31:45] and i'm here to tell you
[1:31:46] god's people are in harmony with him
[1:31:49] if you're going into rapture you're
[1:31:51] going to be in harmony with god
[1:31:55] you believe that
[1:31:59] jesus when he talked about harmony and
[1:32:01] oneness
[1:32:03] it was in
[1:32:04] saint john 17 if you want to read the
[1:32:05] whole chapter is about it but he talks
[1:32:08] about leaving the world and and so forth
[1:32:10] and as thou has sent me i sent them and
[1:32:12] so forth but in verse 26 20 says i pray
[1:32:15] not for these alone but also for them
[1:32:17] which thou shalt believe on me through
[1:32:19] their word
[1:32:21] that they may be one as thou art in me
[1:32:24] and i in thee that they also may be one
[1:32:27] in us so that the world may believe that
[1:32:30] thou hast sent me
[1:32:32] amen how many believes he wants us to be
[1:32:34] one
[1:32:35] and the glory which thou gavest me i
[1:32:37] have given them that they may be one
[1:32:40] even as we are one
[1:32:45] oh my how i could preach tonight about
[1:32:47] how that we as children of god
[1:32:50] need to be one
[1:32:52] together
[1:32:53] brothers and sisters
[1:32:55] folks don't take that word too lightly
[1:32:59] we should take each other as brothers
[1:33:01] and sisters more than your blood
[1:33:06] more than your blood are we brothers and
[1:33:08] sisters because if you have brothers and
[1:33:10] sisters so it's not going to make it
[1:33:11] they're not going to be there in that
[1:33:12] family with you but up there we are
[1:33:14] going to be an eternal family
[1:33:17] sons and daughters of god
[1:33:19] we are one we have the same goals the
[1:33:22] same ambitions
[1:33:24] the same god the same one faith one lord
[1:33:26] one baptism one in god one god and
[1:33:29] father above all who is
[1:33:32] above all and through all i like that
[1:33:35] and he's the one that con is in each and
[1:33:37] every one of us for one by one spirit
[1:33:40] are we all baptized into one body and we
[1:33:43] are members in particular
[1:33:45] amen how many believe that
[1:33:48] amen it takes everything brother bam one
[1:33:50] place he talked about a watch and how
[1:33:52] that the old clock swatches that you had
[1:33:53] to wind up
[1:33:55] pretty spot if they had a glass on the
[1:33:56] back of it bert it'd be pretty cool to
[1:33:58] see one little one little spin spin
[1:34:00] spinning and going back and forth and
[1:34:01] the other one going this way and that
[1:34:03] one's going that way and the little
[1:34:04] wheel starts to turn it and all that
[1:34:06] other can you imagine if a bug got in
[1:34:08] there a little piece of wire got in
[1:34:09] there
[1:34:11] it would stop
[1:34:12] huh that's the way it is in your life
[1:34:14] you let one bug get in your life you
[1:34:16] like a little bit of disharmony get into
[1:34:17] your life and your relationship and
[1:34:20] fellowship with god is shut off you let
[1:34:22] a little sun come in little sin come in
[1:34:24] are you with me
[1:34:26] get away from god just a little bit
[1:34:28] and see how quick that stops
[1:34:31] it all has to be perfect
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:35] praise the lord that they may be one as
[1:34:37] we are
[1:34:38] and and you know this just comes to me
[1:34:39] as i read this but what's he talking
[1:34:41] about he says you know i have let me
[1:34:43] read it again and the glory which thou
[1:34:45] gavest me i have given them what is his
[1:34:48] glory this law is that they may be one
[1:34:51] even as we are one
[1:34:53] amen i in them thou in me that they may
[1:34:57] be perfect in one and that the world may
[1:34:59] know that thou hast sent me and has
[1:35:00] loved them as thou has loved me
[1:35:04] amen
[1:35:06] father i will that they also which thou
[1:35:08] has given me be with me
[1:35:12] where i am
[1:35:16] saint john 14 1 behold i go and prepare
[1:35:19] a place for you that where i am there
[1:35:21] you may be also
[1:35:22] i'm just looking forward one of these
[1:35:24] days we're going to be with jesus
[1:35:29] yes jesus is in here now and we are with
[1:35:31] jesus in the spiritual form
[1:35:33] but i truly believe with all my heart
[1:35:35] that one of these days he's going to
[1:35:36] come in the skies and we're going to see
[1:35:37] him face to face and we're going to have
[1:35:39] a body change because the bible says
[1:35:41] we're going to have body like unto his
[1:35:42] own glorious
[1:35:44] body
[1:35:50] that's his desire his desire is that
[1:35:53] they're going to be with me how many
[1:35:54] wants to be with him
[1:35:59] amen so that's what he said
[1:36:03] be with me where i am that they may
[1:36:05] behold my glory
[1:36:09] folks we talk about a christ that died
[1:36:11] on calvary we talk about a bloody
[1:36:13] massacre
[1:36:15] i mean it was calvary was a bloody
[1:36:17] massacre
[1:36:20] unjust unrighteous and judged him wrong
[1:36:23] and he was he didn't deserve that but
[1:36:25] then killed him anyway
[1:36:27] y'all know the story of the bloody
[1:36:29] cobblestone streets and the blood on his
[1:36:31] back until he looked like a bloody rag
[1:36:34] that was our king of kings
[1:36:38] it was glorious in that he wiped away
[1:36:39] our sins but what's it going to be when
[1:36:41] he comes in his splendor
[1:36:45] when he comes and the clouds are all
[1:36:46] around and all the hosts of heaven and
[1:36:48] all the angels are
[1:36:50] around what's gonna be like folks
[1:36:54] that
[1:36:55] is what you live for
[1:36:57] that's what you
[1:37:00] breathe
[1:37:03] every breath you breathe should be for
[1:37:05] that
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:09] everything else is a distraction
[1:37:12] waste of time
[1:37:15] amen
[1:37:17] because that's the only thing that's
[1:37:18] going to last
[1:37:20] that they may behold my glory
[1:37:24] which thou has given me
[1:37:26] for thou loved me
[1:37:28] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:31] how many believe that god loved you
[1:37:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:36] all whose names were not written in the
[1:37:38] land book of life of the lamb slain from
[1:37:40] the foundation of the world will wander
[1:37:42] after the beast
[1:37:44] god loved you before the foundation of
[1:37:46] the world that's why he loved you first
[1:37:49] we love him because he first loved us
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:57] harmony
[1:38:00] praise the lord
[1:38:02] jesus never did anything until he was
[1:38:04] first showed by the father
[1:38:07] this harmony
[1:38:08] this harmony is now
[1:38:11] to exist
[1:38:14] whew i like that don't you
[1:38:17] i don't care they said this back in the
[1:38:20] 60s brothers on
[1:38:21] they said it in the 70s he preached it
[1:38:23] in the 80s they preached it in the 90s
[1:38:25] they preached in the year 2000 here 2000
[1:38:28] the teens
[1:38:29] it's hard to believe we don't went
[1:38:30] through the teams ain't it we're in the
[1:38:32] 20s now
[1:38:34] 22 my gracious pretty soon they'll be
[1:38:36] 2030 if we aren't careful
[1:38:38] huh
[1:38:40] unbelievable
[1:38:42] it seemed like two days ago that we were
[1:38:44] all shook up about whether our computers
[1:38:46] were going to shut out shut down in the
[1:38:48] year 2000
[1:38:50] now freezers and many people probably
[1:38:52] bought generators and all this other the
[1:38:54] other
[1:38:55] huh here we are
[1:38:57] the babies that were born thin are now
[1:38:59] 22 years old
[1:39:02] my oh my
[1:39:03] no wonder
[1:39:05] i feel old
[1:39:09] all right disharmony is now i like that
[1:39:12] now how many would say yes amen this
[1:39:15] harmony has to exist now
[1:39:18] 2022 disharmony has to exist
[1:39:21] now
[1:39:23] it's time
[1:39:25] for this harmony to exist
[1:39:28] that we have the same harmony as jesus
[1:39:30] did with the spirit
[1:39:33] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:39:36] image of his son
[1:39:37] how many believes that
[1:39:39] between the groom and his bride
[1:39:43] he shows her his word of life and she
[1:39:47] receives it
[1:39:49] you know many churches out there you can
[1:39:51] read predestination or something that
[1:39:53] this bible says i don't believe that we
[1:39:54] don't believe that
[1:39:56] you stand a good chance at not being
[1:39:58] there
[1:39:59] you reject his word you don't receive
[1:40:00] his word
[1:40:02] i don't think that you're on the same
[1:40:04] plane
[1:40:05] yeah you better quit dating
[1:40:09] huh
[1:40:10] because the person that dates this right
[1:40:12] here
[1:40:13] you have to be one that's what dating is
[1:40:15] all about isn't it right to find out if
[1:40:17] you're one if you're on the same mind
[1:40:19] frame
[1:40:21] that's what god is doing god is choosing
[1:40:23] a pride out of every church
[1:40:26] i come from the amish mennonite he's
[1:40:28] choosing a bride
[1:40:30] amen
[1:40:32] and he wants her to be
[1:40:34] and think the way that he thinks
[1:40:38] how many believes that
[1:40:39] this harmonies exist between the groom
[1:40:41] and bride shows his word oh my and she
[1:40:45] never doubts it how many believes that
[1:40:47] this message amen the one thing we
[1:40:49] believe is that we believe this from
[1:40:50] giver to killer so to speak
[1:40:53] and we believe the cover but
[1:40:55] it i don't know why they took it off
[1:40:56] they're always taking something away
[1:40:58] where's my words
[1:40:59] the holy bible
[1:41:01] put it back on there right harmony with
[1:41:03] me
[1:41:04] it said the whole used to say the holy
[1:41:06] bible that's what it is it's the holy
[1:41:08] bible it's god's word
[1:41:09] heaven also passed away but this will
[1:41:11] never pass a word pass away
[1:41:13] one of the things i did when i was first
[1:41:15] born again
[1:41:16] was say i'm going to believe all of it
[1:41:19] did you know that before i was saved
[1:41:22] at first i didn't even want to read the
[1:41:23] bible i said i ain't even reading the
[1:41:25] bible because i won't be close to god
[1:41:26] but there's so much mass confusion in it
[1:41:30] you know i don't know about all that
[1:41:33] huh
[1:41:35] you got a question about me now don't
[1:41:36] you
[1:41:38] yeah boy oh boy brother bottle or you're
[1:41:40] our pastor and you thought you didn't
[1:41:41] want to have the bible that's right
[1:41:43] but it wasn't a few days few weeks later
[1:41:46] something said to me believe it
[1:41:48] take that bible believe it
[1:41:50] believe all of it
[1:41:52] that's what i did i picked it up and i
[1:41:53] said i'm gonna believe this and i'm
[1:41:54] gonna believe every bit of it
[1:41:56] long before i came in a message believe
[1:41:58] every bit of it
[1:42:00] amen
[1:42:02] wasn't really saved yet but i was
[1:42:04] dedicating myself to the lord and some
[1:42:06] because i had a short perhaps a
[1:42:07] justification experience
[1:42:09] i go around
[1:42:12] i test people with this bible and i read
[1:42:14] in saint john there it says yeah uh he
[1:42:16] that is born of god does not commit sin
[1:42:20] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:42:22] cannot sin for he's born of god
[1:42:25] now i knew that we're supposed to rot
[1:42:27] and low down sinners
[1:42:29] not that people do you believe that
[1:42:34] do you believe that i didn't care if i
[1:42:36] didn't understand it
[1:42:38] i just wanted to know if people believe
[1:42:40] it
[1:42:41] don't tell me that's wrong
[1:42:45] because if i can't trust that what can i
[1:42:47] trust what can i believe
[1:42:49] no i don't really understand it and i
[1:42:51] didn't understand until i come into the
[1:42:52] message
[1:42:54] i tested sam golden i tested john steven
[1:42:57] when they was witnessing daryl at the
[1:42:58] saw shop i went there and i said what do
[1:43:00] you think about this scripture right
[1:43:01] here
[1:43:03] sam goldman i'll never forget it he says
[1:43:06] that's right that's nothing but the
[1:43:08] truth each seed of god cannot disbelieve
[1:43:11] a son of god cannot disbelieve this word
[1:43:14] by this word you can't deny yourself and
[1:43:17] i said whoa this is the first guy to
[1:43:18] pass the test
[1:43:24] yeah
[1:43:25] and then they begin to test me a little
[1:43:27] bit
[1:43:28] did you know the bible says in malachi 4
[1:43:29] behold i'll send you elijah the prophet
[1:43:31] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:43:32] lord he'll turn the hearts of children
[1:43:34] back to the fathers it does
[1:43:36] well
[1:43:38] yeah
[1:43:39] well tell me more i don't believe i
[1:43:41] don't not believe it because it's the
[1:43:43] bible so i'm believing it
[1:43:46] that's right god sent prophet to god
[1:43:48] amen took a picture with this
[1:43:51] did miracles one miracle upon miracles
[1:43:53] about miracles whoa what
[1:43:55] yeah and he pointed us right back to
[1:43:57] what paul said
[1:43:59] right nothing but the word of god
[1:44:02] no more signing your name on a church
[1:44:04] book if you want to be a part of church
[1:44:05] you get baptized into the body of christ
[1:44:07] by those
[1:44:08] indwelling holy spirit by one spirit are
[1:44:11] we all baptized into one body that's how
[1:44:13] you get in the body that's what paul's
[1:44:14] thought that's what a man
[1:44:16] huh
[1:44:18] i had to go to that church i just want
[1:44:20] to go to that church where are you all
[1:44:21] at
[1:44:23] they told me where we're at i i don't
[1:44:25] mean to be old and repetitive but y'all
[1:44:27] want to hear it one more time
[1:44:31] where's y'all's church at right down
[1:44:33] this road over to the left and then back
[1:44:35] in the back of that is a little house
[1:44:37] right back there
[1:44:38] and it left brother john seaman with all
[1:44:40] of his family danny seaman just little
[1:44:42] kids sharon just little kids
[1:44:44] you know all dressed right proper and
[1:44:46] everything all right they left and i
[1:44:48] went back there and i looked for that
[1:44:50] house i looked and i didn't find it
[1:44:52] nowhere i couldn't find it for nothing
[1:44:55] and for two weeks i said here i thought
[1:44:56] i had found something and it's gone
[1:45:00] i got
[1:45:01] you couldn't believe how i was searching
[1:45:03] the streets i was looking

[1:45:06] they got to come out to get some more
[1:45:08] groceries at troyers again sometime
[1:45:11] they'll come out of the bushes sometimes
[1:45:12] sure enough they did
[1:45:14] hey
[1:45:18] where y'all go i couldn't find that
[1:45:20] place i've missed these last two weeks i
[1:45:22] ain't been there because i never found
[1:45:24] your place
[1:45:26] and they described it a little better a
[1:45:28] little better if and i'm sure if
[1:45:31] somebody didn't take me back there but
[1:45:32] they described it a whole lot better
[1:45:34] when i got back there sure enough
[1:45:36] there's a little dirt lane that goes
[1:45:38] between big two big orange trees almost
[1:45:41] right it's like you're going in the back
[1:45:43] i don't know back way back in i mean it
[1:45:45] was him back in there
[1:45:47] but sure enough i found it i went back
[1:45:49] there
[1:45:50] oh my
[1:45:52] i can't even can i didn't mean to get on
[1:45:53] this here but maybe it'll help somebody
[1:45:56] but i went back there and we began to
[1:45:57] have service and we'd sit down in the
[1:45:59] living room and talk about the word and
[1:46:00] talk about the word and man we got so
[1:46:02] caught up in the spirit all of a sudden
[1:46:04] i just oh phrase meeting i almost got
[1:46:06] the shout and i'm telling you what there
[1:46:07] was an atmosphere there like you
[1:46:08] wouldn't believe
[1:46:09] they showed me the baptism and how that
[1:46:11] you're supposed to get baptized in the
[1:46:13] name of the lord jesus christ nobody
[1:46:15] ever got baptized in titles of father
[1:46:16] son holy ghost only in the name of jesus
[1:46:18] christ showed me the right word he says
[1:46:20] and i says well i ain't never been
[1:46:21] baptized
[1:46:23] will y'all baptize me god see yeah we'll
[1:46:25] take you down to the philippine creek
[1:46:26] and baptize it
[1:46:28] a couple days later we went down to the
[1:46:29] philippine creek brother joe i think he
[1:46:31] showed me the dock or whatever down in
[1:46:33] there
[1:46:34] amen
[1:46:36] he went down there and i got baptized
[1:46:38] now i'm here to tell you i don't know
[1:46:40] what i was if i was saved before or not
[1:46:43] but i knew afterwards i was
[1:46:46] when i come up out of that water and
[1:46:47] that water is a slow flowing creek was
[1:46:50] back then anyway slow flowing i come up
[1:46:52] on the creek and the creek bench dried
[1:46:54] off a little bit and sat on the bank
[1:46:55] over there and i looked down there and
[1:46:57] there's a whole lot of bubbles
[1:46:59] just cruelly heading out to the ocean
[1:47:02] and man you talk about a feeling in my
[1:47:04] heart
[1:47:06] talk about feeling in my heart
[1:47:08] i thought that i was just going to be
[1:47:10] able to
[1:47:11] feathers here
[1:47:12] and just flop i was just ready to fly
[1:47:14] away i was
[1:47:16] ah so light so peaceful
[1:47:19] and watching those sins
[1:47:21] going out into the sea of god's
[1:47:22] forgetfulness
[1:47:24] and i know it wasn't the water but it
[1:47:25] was the blood taking carrying my sins
[1:47:27] and to see if god's forgetfulness
[1:47:30] amen
[1:47:31] and i'm here to tell you
[1:47:34] it never gets old
[1:47:37] i was 20 years old
[1:47:39] when i got saved 20 years old
[1:47:42] 60 years old now
[1:47:43] and he gets sweeter as the day go by
[1:47:46] i want to be more like him every day i
[1:47:48] failed him many times failing flop and
[1:47:50] everything but by god's grace i thank
[1:47:52] him for his forgiveness don't you
[1:47:54] giving you another chance all the time
[1:47:56] merciful god
[1:47:58] because he started to work and he's
[1:48:00] going to finish it
[1:48:02] amen praise be to god
[1:48:05] and ever since then you know and
[1:48:08] i'm telling my story maybe i'll just
[1:48:09] tell a little more is that all right
[1:48:11] i was on fire for god and i'd take it on
[1:48:14] people's express and go up to ohio and
[1:48:16] witness demonia and baptized money in
[1:48:18] the middle of the winter sometime in
[1:48:19] november it was freezing cold and
[1:48:22] david and baptized david that baptized
[1:48:24] moses they all got baptized and moses
[1:48:26] and david and moses and moani
[1:48:28] seem to have gotten the baptism of the
[1:48:30] holy ghost and got on fire and
[1:48:32] everything else and
[1:48:33] and
[1:48:34] and and mose one time and i was sleeping
[1:48:36] there at their house and me and moses
[1:48:37] went to bed ups and moaning
[1:48:39] and we we we was reading the scriptures
[1:48:41] he says what ask whatever you will and
[1:48:42] believe and and moses was definitely
[1:48:45] amateur and he didn't know that you
[1:48:46] don't just ask for anything
[1:48:49] but we was laying there he says well if
[1:48:50] we truly believe that let's believe that
[1:48:52] that light that that lamp right there
[1:48:54] will light before we go to bed
[1:48:56] we blew it out
[1:48:58] that light's gonna light
[1:49:02] all right i'll bleed with you if you
[1:49:03] believe it i'll leave it believe it but
[1:49:05] let's leave here
[1:49:07] believe it
[1:49:08] oh my
[1:49:10] the light lit before we went to sleep
[1:49:22] i don't care god works in a mysterious
[1:49:24] way that's good enough for me
[1:49:28] praise the lord huh hey you never know
[1:49:30] god works that way
[1:49:32] it was 9 30 tonight you never get
[1:49:34] company that late you know but we did
[1:49:35] that night
[1:49:37] somebody want to talk to moe's and they
[1:49:38] come up and lift that light
[1:49:40] but anyway
[1:49:43] and then from there
[1:49:44] you know witnessing the different people
[1:49:46] just always witness and that's why i
[1:49:47] feel so bad about myself when i think
[1:49:49] about all the people that i don't
[1:49:50] witness to
[1:49:51] that i come in contact with because that
[1:49:53] was my number one enthusiasm when i
[1:49:56] first served the lord was witness to
[1:49:58] people
[1:49:59] you know do you know god sent a prophet
[1:50:01] do you know that god sent malachi 4.
[1:50:03] jesus christ came and proved himself
[1:50:06] just as alive as when he was walking the
[1:50:08] shores of galilee did the very same
[1:50:10] things for 30 some odd years world over
[1:50:13] jesus did not brother madam jesus did
[1:50:17] being a witness to people
[1:50:19] and then i think about sometimes i just
[1:50:22] get caught up in other things so much
[1:50:23] and don't do that as much i'll tell you
[1:50:25] what i believe that if i'd done my job
[1:50:27] this church should probably have a lot
[1:50:28] more people in it
[1:50:30] what about you
[1:50:32] it would do our job because really
[1:50:33] that's what we're here for
[1:50:35] god threw us to be a light to the world
[1:50:37] how many knows we are the light of the
[1:50:38] world as the father has sent me jesus
[1:50:41] said so sent i them the works that i do
[1:50:46] shall you do also if we have the life of
[1:50:48] jesus in us then we're going to do what
[1:50:50] jesus done how many believes that
[1:50:53] praise be to god
[1:50:55] and then one day
[1:50:56] the way that i become a preacher
[1:51:00] didn't really expect it didn't see it
[1:51:01] coming
[1:51:04] but my pastor asked me to preach if i'd
[1:51:06] preach
[1:51:07] i preach
[1:51:09] never thought about that
[1:51:11] i really thought about preaching i was
[1:51:13] just witnessing you know just having my
[1:51:14] bible under my arm wherever i went
[1:51:16] telling people and talking to people god
[1:51:18] gifted me god's always gifted i don't
[1:51:20] know john hershberger is here but some
[1:51:22] of them
[1:51:23] of going into the scriptures and being
[1:51:25] able to explain things
[1:51:26] and make it
[1:51:27] a little simpler i've always been gifted
[1:51:29] with being able to do that
[1:51:31] and so but i never thought about being
[1:51:32] preached or whatever and and then when
[1:51:34] he asked me to preach
[1:51:36] i preached i would caught up in the
[1:51:37] pulpit
[1:51:39] brother danny i got up in the pulpit and
[1:51:41] that first time i preached i was on
[1:51:42] faith or something you know and
[1:51:44] it just really flowed it really went
[1:51:47] good i just really really went good
[1:51:50] but the next time i didn't really get
[1:51:51] out of the way and it wasn't so good
[1:51:55] i did a little bit of flip-flopping
[1:51:57] before i got up on my feet and
[1:52:00] amen
[1:52:01] and i'll tell you this even
[1:52:04] i'll say this even in the old church
[1:52:07] you know
[1:52:08] that i was not as good as preachers i
[1:52:10] could have been hello
[1:52:12] amen i am not today
[1:52:15] but by god's grace i pray the lord will
[1:52:17] help me amen how many any preacher you
[1:52:19] always say lord i could be better i
[1:52:21] could do better amen
[1:52:24] but one thing's for sure
[1:52:26] i have to stay in harmony with god how
[1:52:28] about you if you want to get anything
[1:52:30] from god you got to stay in harmony with
[1:52:32] him all right it's just ten after eight
[1:52:34] that clock hasn't quit or anything right
[1:52:36] all right we're good can we go ten more
[1:52:37] minutes let's go a little bit longer
[1:52:39] and talk about harmony but i like this
[1:52:41] because he says that this harmony is to
[1:52:44] exist between a groom and the bride
[1:52:48] amen
[1:52:50] the harmony of what in other words
[1:52:55] however jesus was it's what we're
[1:52:58] supposed to be
[1:52:59] amen
[1:53:00] whatever kind of relationship that he
[1:53:02] had is the relationship you and i are
[1:53:05] going to have to have
[1:53:07] before we leave this place
[1:53:10] page 171 of the church age book brother
[1:53:13] ben put it this way i think brother
[1:53:15] uh brad touched on it here uh on his
[1:53:18] last sermon talking about a seed that's
[1:53:20] planted that seed's going to bring forth
[1:53:21] whatever is planted amen
[1:53:24] and this message seed listen whatever
[1:53:26] seed started the church will come forth
[1:53:29] and be like the original seed because it
[1:53:32] is the same seed in these last days the
[1:53:35] true bride church
[1:53:37] will come to the headstone and she will
[1:53:40] be
[1:53:41] a superchurch
[1:53:46] a super race
[1:53:49] because how many knows that's what jesus
[1:53:50] was
[1:53:51] jesus
[1:53:52] was superman
[1:53:56] jesus
[1:53:58] was super
[1:53:59] man
[1:54:01] he could walk on the water
[1:54:03] he could bring people back from being
[1:54:05] four days dead
[1:54:07] that's superman
[1:54:09] just speak the word they come back
[1:54:13] praise be to god peter was in such
[1:54:15] harmony with jesus that even he could
[1:54:17] walk on the water
[1:54:19] until he got a little bit distracted
[1:54:23] huh
[1:54:26] folks i have the other half of this
[1:54:28] message and the other half of this
[1:54:29] message is about when you come out of
[1:54:31] harmony with god
[1:54:32] i mean it was when david got out of
[1:54:34] harmony with god you talk about trouble
[1:54:37] sitting in
[1:54:39] i want to just make a statement i hope
[1:54:40] he ever hears it here and out there you
[1:54:42] get out of the will of god and you're in
[1:54:46] for some major chaos
[1:54:50] you're in for major trouble i'm talking
[1:54:51] about the will of god it's very
[1:54:54] important that you find the will of god
[1:54:58] because if you ain't in that will you
[1:55:00] ain't part of the program
[1:55:02] god ain't gonna bless it
[1:55:04] because all jesus did was whatever the
[1:55:06] will of the father was
[1:55:10] i'm just gonna say this
[1:55:13] um
[1:55:14] maybe i could do it verse 20 let me see
[1:55:16] if i have it
[1:55:21] five no no i don't have it
[1:55:25] i've got it wrote down here yeah
[1:55:28] john john 4
[1:55:30] 34. it is
[1:55:33] 4
[1:55:34] 30
[1:55:35] 4.
[1:55:38] we'll start with verse 30
[1:55:40] 1.
[1:55:41] in the meantime while his disciples
[1:55:43] prayed him saying master
[1:55:45] eat and he said unto them i have meat
[1:55:48] tea that you know not of
[1:55:50] therefore said the disciples one to
[1:55:51] another had any man brought him ought to
[1:55:54] eat remember when he went to fetch me
[1:55:57] when they come back said jesus said unto
[1:55:59] them my
[1:56:01] meat
[1:56:02] is to do
[1:56:04] the will
[1:56:05] of him that sent me
[1:56:09] praise be to god can we just revel in
[1:56:11] that thought for just a minute
[1:56:13] everybody who likes food
[1:56:15] likes a good rib eye
[1:56:17] potatoes
[1:56:18] baked beans
[1:56:20] anytime you get hungry all the time you
[1:56:22] want to eat you want to eat oh boy we
[1:56:24] like to eat too much
[1:56:26] huh
[1:56:28] jesus says when it comes to hunger when
[1:56:31] it comes to wanting something needing
[1:56:33] something to eat
[1:56:35] my father's doing my father's will
[1:56:39] is my mean
[1:56:41] that's what satisfies me
[1:56:45] you get that
[1:56:47] it will only
[1:56:49] a real believer
[1:56:50] his real meat what makes him happy what
[1:56:54] satisfies him is to do the father's will
[1:56:58] then you feel full and you feel
[1:57:00] satisfied
[1:57:02] if you do the father's will
[1:57:05] and that's the holy spirit in you
[1:57:07] his will
[1:57:09] praise be to god
[1:57:14] i love him better every day
[1:57:18] i love him better every day
[1:57:22] folks there's a lot of people that have
[1:57:24] to sing that different i don't love him
[1:57:26] as much today
[1:57:29] i don't love him i don't feel like
[1:57:31] singing
[1:57:32] so much today
[1:57:34] huh isn't that terrible
[1:57:36] how many wants to love him more
[1:57:38] i love him better
[1:57:40] every day
[1:57:41] my meat is to do the father's will let
[1:57:44] me finish the quote
[1:57:46] there is super church
[1:57:48] a super race
[1:57:52] you're going to have to be super if
[1:57:53] you're going to overcome this age
[1:57:56] because i'm here to tell you the devil
[1:57:57] is throwing everything out there that
[1:57:59] he's got
[1:58:01] every instrument every trick
[1:58:04] that he's got you want to know why the
[1:58:07] politicians
[1:58:09] i mind goodness
[1:58:11] if you would look at the politics of
[1:58:13] this country in this world you wouldn't
[1:58:15] want no part of it
[1:58:17] but yet people are gung-ho about these
[1:58:20] things they're gung-ho about the left
[1:58:22] they're gung-ho about
[1:58:24] transsexuality and oh they're
[1:58:27] gung-ho oh they they pushing it they
[1:58:29] hate the right
[1:58:31] they're passionate about it why
[1:58:35] because there's a spirit behind it
[1:58:38] it's an evil spirit behind it that's
[1:58:40] driving this world
[1:58:42] amen
[1:58:46] oh my i don't want to get political but
[1:58:49] it's sad isn't it you can have no
[1:58:52] confidence in your government
[1:58:54] when they can't balance their own
[1:58:56] checkbook
[1:58:57] and they're 30 trillion dollars in debt
[1:59:00] and they want to tell you how you ought
[1:59:01] to do i don't think so
[1:59:04] you know they lose you lose your con
[1:59:07] your confidence in them just because of
[1:59:09] that alone
[1:59:10] and then everything else
[1:59:13] and how many knows it's run by the devil
[1:59:17] jesus offered him all the kingdoms of
[1:59:19] the world if he'll just bow down before
[1:59:21] him
[1:59:23] oh my can you imagine
[1:59:26] i don't even want to try to imagine if
[1:59:28] jesus would have took it
[1:59:31] i don't know what it had been like if he
[1:59:33] took in the offer yeah i'll be the king
[1:59:34] of the world
[1:59:35] i'll i'll rule everything
[1:59:41] let me tell you something i feel under
[1:59:43] the anointing of the holy spirit there
[1:59:46] wasn't even a slight chance that was
[1:59:48] going to happen
[1:59:51] there wasn't even a slight chance the
[1:59:54] thought of the whole thing is even
[1:59:56] irrelevant and stupid to think of what
[1:59:58] it would have been like
[2:00:00] because he would have never taken it
[2:00:02] never ever would he have to he's god
[2:00:05] because he would have been under the
[2:00:07] domain of the devil
[2:00:10] that ain't gonna happen
[2:00:12] amen
[2:00:14] get thee behind me satan what was it the
[2:00:16] prophet said he got singed he got zapped
[2:00:19] by a uh
[2:00:21] uh nuclear megaton bomb or a or so many
[2:00:25] wires he got fried he got his feather
[2:00:27] singed that day
[2:00:29] get thee behind me satan
[2:00:32] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[2:00:35] amen and him only shalt thou worship
[2:00:38] because if he fell down on the devil
[2:00:39] he'd been worshiping the devil
[2:00:41] there's only one that he worshipped amen
[2:00:45] super church surprise how many knows
[2:00:47] that you've got to
[2:00:49] folks i'm telling you if you're
[2:00:50] christian and you are a victorious i'm
[2:00:52] saying if you're a victorious christian
[2:00:55] today
[2:00:56] you are super
[2:01:01] i was thinking on the way to church
[2:01:04] i believe the prophet made the statement
[2:01:06] he says what would it be like if
[2:01:07] everybody would submit themselves to god
[2:01:09] and everybody would be a christian what
[2:01:11] a wonderful world it would be
[2:01:13] and we were all one because i was
[2:01:15] looking looking under the unity and
[2:01:17] harmony and so forth he says if we were
[2:01:19] all under harmony and unity of god what
[2:01:20] it would be like then on the way to
[2:01:22] church i wonder why it isn't why is it
[2:01:24] that it's so evil out there
[2:01:28] there's only one answer
[2:01:31] because the seed
[2:01:34] of the wicked one
[2:01:35] way
[2:01:36] outnumbers
[2:01:38] god's people
[2:01:41] huh
[2:01:41] how many knows it way out numbers
[2:01:45] i believe when brother branham talked
[2:01:46] about he says you know it's like a great
[2:01:47] big bunch of darkness and then just once
[2:01:49] in a while you'll see a white light
[2:01:51] quite light white light there's a
[2:01:52] christian there's a once in a while once
[2:01:54] in a while in that darkness there's a
[2:01:55] white light
[2:01:56] everything else is darkness
[2:01:59] that's about what this world is
[2:02:04] now notice in closing
[2:02:06] as she nears him
[2:02:08] she'll be a super race super people as
[2:02:10] she nears him
[2:02:12] they in the bride they will be
[2:02:16] so much
[2:02:19] like him
[2:02:20] until they will be in his very
[2:02:25] image
[2:02:29] i hope everybody here i know you did i
[2:02:32] hope everybody there heard that
[2:02:34] that if you're a part of the bride of
[2:02:36] christ you're going to be in the image
[2:02:37] of god you're going to be in that
[2:02:40] predestinated image of god form
[2:02:44] as we get closer
[2:02:47] oh my
[2:02:49] as we feel the pressure of laodicea the
[2:02:53] pressure of this age
[2:02:58] it presses
[2:03:00] the people so much until
[2:03:02] they crayon themselves everywhere
[2:03:05] they put earrings and nose rings and
[2:03:07] everything else but the bride
[2:03:09] it pushes you into christ
[2:03:12] how many believes that the pressure
[2:03:14] pushes
[2:03:16] the bride closer and closer to god
[2:03:23] if that's not working in your life you
[2:03:25] need to have a good altar call alter
[2:03:27] somewhere and say god
[2:03:29] i'm not getting closer to you like i
[2:03:30] should
[2:03:35] just
[2:03:36] what comes to my mind you will be more
[2:03:38] careful
[2:03:40] about your conduct
[2:03:42] your attitude
[2:03:45] every day
[2:03:47] not just when you come to church or get
[2:03:48] around friends but when you're in
[2:03:50] business all your business associates no
[2:03:53] matter who you're dealing with you'll
[2:03:55] want them to see the reflection of
[2:03:57] christ
[2:03:59] it's a whole
[2:04:01] i don't know it's okay i'll say what the
[2:04:03] spirit says it's a whole lot better to
[2:04:05] lose a little money
[2:04:08] and have people to think of you as a
[2:04:10] christian than it is for you to get the
[2:04:12] better deal and them to hate you
[2:04:14] not think of you as a christian
[2:04:21] like i said that just
[2:04:22] comes
[2:04:27] amen
[2:04:29] there in the bride will be so much like
[2:04:31] him that they will be in his very image
[2:04:33] this is in order
[2:04:38] to be united with him amen
[2:04:42] they will
[2:04:44] be
[2:04:45] one
[2:04:48] philippians i believe it is
[2:04:52] let this mind
[2:04:54] be in you
[2:04:55] that was also in christ jesus
[2:05:01] lord
[2:05:02] let my mind be your mind

[2:05:14] thoughts that i'm supposed to think

[2:05:53] he will lead you on what to ask
[2:05:56] and in the way to ask it because i

[2:06:05] he is the one that basically prays for
[2:06:07] us and asks for us
