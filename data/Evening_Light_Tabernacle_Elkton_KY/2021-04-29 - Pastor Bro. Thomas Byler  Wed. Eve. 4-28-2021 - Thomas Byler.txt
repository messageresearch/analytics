sunday he passed away and went to be with the lord and i i began to think as i was praying and i was telling brother thomas and brother stephen then back there when we prayed this morning we moved to arkansas when i was nine years old and the herald was up there in galena and i guess he'd been there in that little town and had that little church there for over 50 years and i said you know his children are gonna miss him but some of those people that's the only pastor they've ever had he's been there for all those years and been solid a real good brother and just pray for that church and that family tonight that god will just be with them and comfort their hearts and i know we all know if we could see where they're at tonight there wouldn't be any sadness in any of us when we lose a loved one if we really could truly see where they're at but i just pray that god will comfort their hearts tonight and also continue to remember brother irvin and sister martha they're doing something better we'll remember them in prayer and also a friend of ours in arkansas i i didn't tell but the stephen we had prayer but sister marie mccomas she has pneumonia and they asked that the lord would just move on her behalf and she's like a lot of us and and the lord's just done so many great things in her life and i i began to think about it when i sing the prayer requests for her and how that she was in very very bad shape and they met up with brother branham and brother branham prayed for her right there on the streets and the lord just done a miracle in their lives and in her body and i began to think three years ago they give her up and they said she was gonna die and she just keeps marching on and she's come down the stemoni and i thought well lord if it's her time to go you'll take her but if not she definitely believes that you're a healer tonight so just pray for her and also pray for jan tomorrow we go to the wounds doctor tomorrow for them to look at her leg and

thank you all for the musicians amen yes yes god is good isn't he amen brother daryl has he had a funeral this weekend so amen so just letting everybody know let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you father once again lord thank for god that we can assemble ourselves together in your name knowing lord jesus that wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you are in our midst lord and father we're so grateful for that and desire god that you'd be not only in our midst but lord that you would speak to our hearts tonight the things that you once said lord that's every effort that's been made that's every heart you know what's beneath every heart and father as we once again look open the bible and look at your word father we just ask god that your lord you would give the inspiration father to say what you once said lord tonight we want to remember all those that are not feeling well but that are getting better we asked lord did you just continue to raise them all up lord father we believe that by your stripes we are healed lord we thank you father for healing and lord we ask god that you just speak to us now in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen let's turn our bibles to revelations to revelations once again we're going to speak on the same kind of not the exact the same line of thought as we did sunday but it will certainly have to do with speaking about the purpose of god amen the purpose of god and so revelations 4 amen and i really like this scripture and then also colossians the first chapter colossians 1. so col revelations 4 and we'll begin with verse 8 and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and which is and which is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast your crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created over in colossians you'll notice how that this certainly goes paul writing the letter to colossians the epistle of paul to the colossians and the other one of course which john the revelator as we call him in colossians 1 and we'll begin with let's go with about strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the father we have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us in the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins and this is kind of what the point we want to get to talking about who jesus was who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him amen i mean he believes that he was all for his purpose and for his pleasure everything that was made was made for him i hate to disappoint people but that's the truth amen now notice and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminences amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight amen god is good i'll tell you what when you just get god on your mind and when you begin to think about god and how great he is and and you know and to know what he's done in your life and is doing in your life amen it does something for you amen so sunday we talked about first for one thing the omnipotence of god and the omniscience of god how that god is all-powerful amen and so we know here colossians paul is telling the colossians there he says you know anything that was made was made by him amen whether there's let me just say it again all things were created by him that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible amen not only the visible world has been created by him but also the invisible i mean what we would call the other dimension amen how many knows yet we have a theophany body waiting over there amen it's hard to fat a minute that you have another body waiting for you over there amen and you know and so you have one waiting so that if this body was to fail if he was to you know because we know the prophet says we have none of us none of us here sitting here this evening have a guarantee that you'll be here tomorrow morning life has absolutely no guarantee in the next five minutes amen it's all in the hands of almighty god but if you're in the hands of god and you know god then you know that he has a place for you is that right jesus said i'm gonna go and prepare a place for you amen so that uh and if i come again i'll receive you unto myself and we realize that jesus is going to prepare a place for the bride of jesus christ amen you don't know just what it'll be like none of us know just what it'll be like we know that you and i can't imagine what's over there waiting for us amen you'll have to take your last breath or go in the rapture to actually begin to see what's really over there and as we begin to talk about the purpose of god the plan of god amen it seems like in the world that we're living in it seems like the purpose and the plan of the devil is greater and louder and more obvious than what god's plan is am i right i mean you look around and you can see how everything's going and how it is going in the favor the way that the devil wants it to go in the right and it'll go the way the devil wants it to go all the way to the end all the way to where you and i are squeezed out amen the pressure comes down amen we know that god has a purpose god has a plan amen never never before i don't believe ever have we understood that plan better than what you and i know and understand it in this hour amen because we know that those seals that were sealed up in the book of revelation those seven seals that were sealed amen all the way to this end time amen a lot of the mysteries of god has not been made known a lot of the things were not known to us but i truly believe and know that in all of that when it looks like perhaps satan's agenda is is going the way that he wants it to go we know that god is doing the work i mean believes god is doing a work he has a plan and it's uh you know he's the beginning he's the end he knows the end from the beginning and and he knew it all nothing is a surprise to god amen he already knows exactly how it's all going to go and so now notice here i want to talk about and i was going to title this tonight the preeminent one the preeminent one amen because if you'll notice that all things were created for him amen and by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist amen now another place you know it talks about how god is feeling he is all and in all or and in y'all i heard brother bam say the other day paul was from kentucky he says because he says you know god is in y'all i didn't even hear him say that before but i thought yeah i picked that up i believe it's paul he said he is in you all in you all amen so praise the lord so now notice here he says and he is the head of the body the church the beginning of the firstborn from the dead amen the firstborn from the dead that that in all things he might have the preeminences amen i looked that up and asked siri what preeminences means and it says the fact of surpassing all others amen superiority superiority is what that preeminence means in other words he is the one that is superior in your life and in my life amen in the church how many knows the prophet told us that you know in the bible it says that god the church is to be led not by man but by god amen god wants to lead every individual by the holy spirit praise be to god so we look at this we see here that that was the purpose of bodies that he wanted to brienne one of the preeminences in his church he had a multi-purpose he has different he had a purpose of coming amen and his purpose of course is threefold according to the prophet of god in christ the mystery of god he has a threefold purpose god did now let's first of all look and as we begin to look at ephesians the first chapter if you want to go with me we're going to kind of go through some scriptures tonight for just a little while and see what the lord will have for us amen and we're going to deal with just a little bit of the omniscience of god his all-knowingness and so forth at the end from the beginning he was before all things he says and by by him all things consist so how many knows he was before the first thing started and he knew everything amen if uh and we were you know been taught by the prophets of god that if he wasn't any thinking from the foundation of the world there ain't no way you'll ever be there amen because the bible says all those whose names were not written on the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world wander after the beast amen so you begin to get identified you begin to get identified amen if you are a believer in the word of god it shows who you are and that is a marvelous thing amen boy i'll tell you what aren't you glad tonight that you understand amen first of all the plan of god and then where you are in that plan because it's not good enough just to know the plan of god or to understand it mentally but to know where you are in that plan and what part you are in that plan i want to talk about god's building tonight for a little while so god is building a building amen a new jerusalem he's building uh he's building basically heaven the inhabitants of the heavens are being built they're being made in the midst of all this the inhabitants are being made amen because we know that god wouldn't just go off and build us a house he wouldn't just go off and build us a beautiful place amen in that place be empty i mean please there's going to be a lot of folks over there amen he's going to build and that's what he's doing now let's start with ephesians 1 and verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places amen i trust that's where each and every one of you said tonight amen just sitting in that what is this color that we have just sitting on the bench just sitting in the church doesn't sit you in heavenly places does it now you can sit there and be completely miserable amen you can be in hellish places so to speak amen it's all about where your heart is amen where your soul is where your mind is amen in heavenly places in christ jesus according as he has chosen us and wrote our name down when we repented does that sound right i hear one no that doesn't sound right does it because a lot of people teach that you get saved and you have your names put they even wrote songs about another name was put on the book tonight amen no it was put on there a long time ago it was put on at all praise be to god y'all say sitting now because if you believe that your name was written on the left book of life from the foundation of the world folks you got something a lot happier be about you know man how maybe if you've got something to be happy about amen i was at the ballpark the other night listening watching my granddaughter daughter kick a ball around so nothing six to nothing so we weren't too cheerful but he looked over at the other ball diamond and there was a bunch of just little tots over there you know they were just barely can't hit the ball but they even i'll tell you what them little top they weren't screaming and hollering but the parents boy you should have heard them i said man we ought to take that game up they have a lot more fun over there parents screaming and hollering and carrying on i thought boy people really get enthusiastic about something don't they they sure will but if we got something i'd be happy tonight to believe that your name was put on that book amen to believe tonight by faith that your name is there amen that you he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world how many believes you had to be in the premeditated thoughts of god he knows all things he knows the end from the beginning amen and he knowed who would and who would not because he knows what's in people's hearts that's why he could do it i don't know about you but you know you know i don't know about you but whenever i go to building a house it's nice to have somebody that has a plan well no i don't know how i want this bill well you call me when you know i want this place built you know because man it can you can you can spend weeks just designing a place right you can spend a lot of time just figuring out how you want this plate amen and so it has to be pre-planned that has to be going through and that's what god did before he first created the first thing is he had already figured out just how he wanted it all amen can i just preach as it comes reminds me of the story who uh this builder this this homeowner that wanted uh wanted his house built and he gave his plans and everything to the builder and he said build me a house when i come back i want my house built well he came back and guess what this little uh hut wasn't where it was supposed to be the closet wasn't where it's supposed to be and this wasn't supposed to be on he thought the builder had a better idea uh he wasn't too happy with all of that would you be no and see that's exactly what's happening with denominational people that put their intolerant interpretation of the word of god god says this is how i want it you know and when it's wrong he's gonna say tear that out tear that out tear that out and build it the way that the plan said i mean believe that's what we got to do come according to the plan of god because god truly wants to have the preeminences amen in our lives and if we don't build it right god has to tear it down boy i'll tell you what a child of god when he doesn't do what god wants him to do he's in a lot of trouble god will get all over you he really will because he's not just going to let you he's going to fix you yay i thank you lord for fixing me i would rather get fixed and throw to the side amen and god is going to see to it that we are the way that we're supposed to be amen oh i like this so before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen how many is glad for that god wants you in love in love with him and without blame in front of him in love that's how god wants us having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of our will no that's right people think that it's all about our will no it's about his will amen no man can even come to the father but by me no man it can come to me except my father draw him it's according to the will of god so now notice he says to the praise of the glory of his grace where he hath hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein has abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will praise be to god wow you realize how many generations people wondered what it was all about and here god has made it known to us what his will was what his plan was and people refused to believe i don't believe it right comes down and proves that that's exactly what his will is nah i don't believe that i don't believe that cain was of that wicked one i don't believe that seth was of god i don't think there's children of the devil and children of god and god has a plan and he works around and amen he manipulates wherever he wants to meaningfully amen oh yeah remember how that herod wanted to kill all of the children and the angels told joseph mary look we're going to escape this we're going to go on over there go on escape you know you know but listen so listen so we realize what his plan is but people still don't want to believe it they would rather want to believe that they came from if you want to believe that in in in evolution that would be up to the world i know nobody nobody here will amen or you won't be too comfortable isn't that right to believe that they came from something like that and rather than to believe the will of god he has made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself i've always said no matter how cruel no matter how bad you think the plan is i believe it's a good plan the whole thing's been a good plan you could get tortured every day of your life tortured burnt with fire grow through with wires whatever every day of your life you could get tortured you might say boy this is a bad no it's still a good plan because guess what if at the end of all of that torture you get eternity of perfect bliss oh it's still a good plan believe me because paul he was miserable paul lived a miserable life when jesus said i'm going to recruit you paul but i'm going to show you how great of things you're going to suffer for me huh he promised him a life of suffering amen and you know people don't see the plan of god today that's because god's plan is so simple amen how many beliefs that you would be led by the holy ghost but yet how many would say here well i hear the voice of god telling me hey you know you better you know i know that life's gonna turn green but don't go that big old truck ain't gonna be able to stop no none of us can probably say that that gonna happen right we don't have a live voice telling us those things if you do raise your hand say well i've heard the verb no but what is it there's something down in here isn't it there's a still small voice that tells us things sure it does happens to me all the time little quiet voice will say something if i listen to that voice hello most of the time i'm very glad i did hello how many of you can say that when you don't listen to that voice and that certainly is a problem with a lot of us not being led by the spirit is we ain't got a scented enough spirit we're not close enough to god to hear that little voice speak to us so if you don't get nothing out of service tonight say god that's what i want i want to get more sensitive so that i can hear that voice because you do lead us by that i mean he does want to lead us by the holy ghost he really does and that's how he leads oh he can he can speak to you verbally he sure can or he can speak to you by reading the bible and oh that's what i need right there or he can do it through the ministry a lot very very let me say this very very very very very very very very you got this very very likely god's going to speak to you through the mystery ministry huh that's right i believe it because that's what i tend to find full ministry for what the perfecting of the saints so god's going to work through that five-fold ministry but he can do it through the bible he can through the whirlwind in the tree if he wants to talk to you but god does speak to his church god does lead his church and church i'm telling you that was his ultimate goal as should i say the second goal that god had was to get the preeminences in his people amen christ the mystery of god brother braham said there's a threefold mystery that god had purpose that god had amen and the first thing what he wanted to do was reveal himself to his people it meant he wanted to show us what his plan was i mean believes that amen now notice and the first one to show himself who really this god that knows everything this god that created the moon and the stars this god that is a mission all-powerful this god that is out there the first thing he wanted to do was show us what he is like huh israel was scared to death of this god remember whenever they uh uh when god told moses i'm gonna come on top of mount sinai you know i'm gonna speak to the people but if anybody crosses this line you get too close to me with your sinful life with your sinful heart you get too close into my presence i will kill you isn't that what he said you will be dead so don't cross that line it's your own life amen and whenever god did talk remember it was a roared and thundered and scared the people to death and after that if i'm not wrong it was after that that the people said let moses speak and not god and god says that's how i'm going to do it from here on out i'm going to speak through a prophet i'm going to use god's mouth peace my peace will be through humanity amen and the prophet always also taught us that the hardest thing for one human to do is to listen to another human huh i wonder why that is well partially because we both had a brain we both can figure things out and we're quick to say well i don't know about that i got a better idea i think it's this way huh sure we tend to be that way don't we so he says it's hard for him to get to listen to another that's why how many believes that's why you need god behind and backing a person up so that you can have confidence hey i believe that amen i believe that man i believe that prophet i believe that pastor i believe that evangelist i believe it ever coming by so the purpose was the first purpose that he had was show what this god is really like amen praise be to god let me see if i can find that scripture yes in colossians chapter 1 and verse 15 it says that jesus was the listen he was the uh he was the image of the invisible god how many believes that's who jesus what jesus was the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him all things that were made that was made god was completely and totally expressed in jesus christ and when he came if you'll notice the pharisees were legalistic they they wanted to abide by the law just like paul did you know hey if you get caught in this that or the other let them stone them if you you know if you take your neighbor's stuff and you got to restore fivefold and all these other stuff they were legalistic so they tried to trap jesus when that woman was caught in the very act they brought what hurt before him and had their stones ready and said now the law says that you know she is to be stoned amen but jesus said something i will have mercy amen go figure out what that means i will have mercy amen different times he says go figure out what this scripture means because there's going to be a dispensation of grace a dispensation of mercy and forgiveness and so god in jesus was expressing at that time of the mercy and the grace dispensation because how many knows that all of that stuff going on out there right now it's all under the mercy of god sure it is that blood that covers the earth didn't prophetic god said if that ever blood ever goes it'll be all over that even your sins even my failed faults and failures they come up there and it works as a buffer it won't go on up to god because why that blood is there but if that blood wasn't there it would be judgment so he began to express love for god's love the world and everything that jesus did he was the perfectly expressed image of almighty god that was his one number one priority and when everybody saw that they had to wonder even nicodemus had to say we know that you are from god because nobody could do these things unless they were a god those pharisees you know even nicodemus expressed the hypocrisy of the pharisees because they knew they couldn't let rattle he could have never raised lazarus four days in the grave unless god was with him the devil just can't do that stuff an evil person just can't do that stuff the devil can't raise people from the dead only god can raise people from the dead and so they had all kinds of stuff in their minds and all of that stuff in their minds their jealousy and their pride and all that'll be brought up on the day of judgment isn't it right that'll all be brought out you knew you knew boy oh boy i'll tell you what it you know can that be a lesson for us that when you know something's wrong you do it anyway remember you're not going to get away with that that's not going to work god doesn't accept that no you got to have a clean conscience when the holy spirit tells you something you better heed it amen because it'll be played back on the day of judgment and you don't i don't know about you but i don't want to be on the wrong side of judgment i want to be on the right side of judgment okay so that was the first first ambition first goal that god had is i'm going to let humanity understand and to know what this great god is like and what do we find that this great god was like he was a god of not killing everybody and genocide murder he was god of love even bob says god is love amen how many knows he couldn't truly love you unless he made a way for you to have pardon that's why he went to the cross because he loved and so he made a way for humanity he made a way for us to be reconciled back to god again through the cross of calvary that was his purpose that was the first purpose of his coming amen and the whole purpose of god because all the way from genesis he talks about the seed bruising his heal and so forth the seed that was to come and israel for oh my all of those years look for his coming amen all right let me try to hold that thought and pick it back up again of jesus how that god came to express god i'm thinking today you know of how long it seems like that the plan and the purpose of god is like a long time so i thought 2 000 years peter for 2 000 years now that sounds like a lot doesn't it huh that sounds like a lot but if parish was here perhaps or somebody that's up in their 90s and you think about how one lifetime perhaps if you live to be 100 years old right and that one man lives a hundred years old and then pick up another person and they live a hundred years old right a thousand years is only ten men's lives seems a lot shorter don't it two thousand years would only be twenty men's lives only twenty men's lives if they lived to be a hundred that's not so long is it that doesn't sound near as long because how many knows you know as we get older this life is really short it went really bad by really fast and to think that we're about to go into third phase of god's plan is the glory thing so anyway think about it so jesus come he paid the price we found that it was love and so forth amen how could we ever understand this great god who covered all time covered all space the great knowledge that he had hey i don't know about you but i still ain't got an even close to figure it out have you no no i still don't understand all this you can't understand god he's just way too great i'm just so glad to be a part of him aren't you just glad that he's working on you that he is shaping you and getting you ready for what lays ahead in the midst of all that's going on yeah that's right in the midst of our busy busy every day god is working on us amen so now notice so now notice he was father he was son he was holy ghost now he what did he wanted to do he loved fatherhood sure he loved to be the father in the old testament but he had to become the son of man and that becomes you know son of man in order to really express who he was amen and identify himself and reveal to the human race what he really was and now notice the second thing that he wanted the second thing that he wanted was to have the preeminence in his body of believers how many believes that's what he wants tonight that's what he's striving that's what he really wants he and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in some things he might have the preeminence a little bit of us he can have the preeminence that in all things he can have the preeminence how many knows that every time you go off do your own thing or do something you ought to do and you know that's still you in there that's not him having the preeminences yet i was laying on the bed the other day and i looked down at my foot i was like look at that there's my foot there's my toes i got shoes on tonight this is it amazing got it when my mind says toe wiggle there it goes you know i mean it just it just does it's so perfect can you imagine whatever god hooked up whatever however he did it you know i mean it's almost it's so instantaneous you know i mean the second your mind tells you to do it does it you know and that's the way that god wants how many knows he's the head of the church he's our head that's how quick we should be to react when god tells us something or when he wants us to move just automatically move because he truly is the head we are the body amen i believe it we don't have the cloud up here do we but it was the cloud and brother bam says how that is our head that's christ he's our head his body is here on the earth but his head the head is in heaven that right it's over in that other dimension and we are his body amen god is building his church all right so the second was that he might have the preeminence in his believer that is his bride that he might live in his people when jesus walked on the earth everybody could just well even even john the baptist said behold behold behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world behold the messiah the woman that ran into the city said isn't this the messiah the messiah is here is that right behold look at what it is amen when oh my when he raised lazarus from the dead and the multitudes followed him and oh he had everybody's attention isn't that right because people were seeing god among men even that young man that had his eyes opened in the fears he said you know who is this man that opened his eyes and so forth and he said jesus opened my eyes and the pharisees yeah right we don't notice jesus and from where he is just opened himself up the young man says well now isn't that something you're the spiritual leaders you got your your next doll your clothes just right you're the spiritual leaders of the day and here comes somebody and that opens my heart and you don't know where he is don't sound like me or doing your job right brother it don't sound like you're doing what you're supposed to be doing you ought to know where this guy's from amen yeah you can cast me out of your church because i probably don't want to be there anyway all right not if you don't know where this man comes from he'll sick and raise the dead huh go back home repent need to be following him too just get him good you love him tonight all right so behold they looked at god with us the affairs of the disciples followed him everywhere they believed him and oh my when everybody else forsook him and said will you go also and they said no you're all alone i have the words of eternal life peter didn't want him talking about leaving and all of that no we want you to stay here we want you to restore this without no it's not no i need to go he said i need to go it's expedient it's necessary that i go in the right it was needful that he went because the next thing that god wanted to express was what he wanted to express what jesus looks like through his children amen that's why sunday i brought brother stephen up here should be able to prayed so to speak any one of us up here and be able to say look at this person right here this is jesus son this is jesus's daughter amen because i'll tell you how many knows as you do your work as you go live here as you do whatever it is that's what people seeing people are seeing jesus in his children they're seeing god expressed think about that for a minute think about that for a minute really brand everybody sees us every encounter people have with us we express jesus makes you humble donut makes you want to say lord jesus help me to be a good reflection let me be a good reflection and i think this is the part brothers and sisters that tonight is the most important part for you and for me isn't that right if he truly wants the pre emptiness of my and i can't sometimes we get preaching brother we get down there the inspiration and we can speak things by the holy ghost and so forth you know i know people pentecost and those that could give themselves to that spirit they could speak in tongues and duty things no right the prophet of god was so yielded he was so in tune with god doing god's will amen until he could stand here and he began to talk he says now that's not my voice not right as soon as he would begin his sermon it was always god taking him over and having the preeminences that's why that discernment was never ever wrong amen i defy these hypocrites these devil possessed people that now that he's gone dare to try to say he was wrong about this and that all right because i've gotta lo i love i'd love for him to be here and for you to come up and say that yeah because they would never do it no but now he's gone they have the courage to run their mouth but let me tell you something you speak one word against god's prophet whom he has sent proven and vindicated isn't that right jesus himself would come down and back him up and then you speak about that and speak evil of that you will not go unaccount i'm not accountable amen but so much so and then people would say well that's what jesus is with the woman at the way he deserved their thoughts and intents at our heart you know pronounced some heal one little girl had i don't i'm not sure just exactly how it was but i know she couldn't see i'm not sure if she even had eyeballs and he prayed for her isn't that right and she had eyeballs and then he said well wait a minute he says now what color eyes would you like i don't know about you that still does something to me it'll always do something to know that our god that we talk about came and did things like that among us to know that it's god almighty amen no man could do that brother brahm could never do that but if he yields himself to god god can do that how many believes that tonight if we will yield ourselves of more than what we are ask ourselves does god have all the preeminences in our lives or is there still some of me in there hey my hands up i i gotta admit there's still some of me in there i truly be their s but i say god i surrender all help me not to have any of me in there god has the most peculiar ways of bringing that out in you amen and showing you whether they're still things since there's still some of you in there so it says that in all things he might have the preeminences amen and i truly believe that as a body speaking as a body because brother branham whenever the discernment came remember this that he taught that martin luther was part of that body and he all he had was the judge shall live a faith that right that was in the feet area in that right feet part of the body amen and then up comes john wesley sanctification now you gotta have to be sanctified amen and he talked about here and oh no it became pentecost and all of a sudden that speaking in tongues the gift of tongues came back isn't that right and then when we come up a little bit higher and then we had a prophet a seer eyes that could tell you the future could tell you the past tell you what germany's going to do what hitler is going to do he's going to uh you know all of these different powers are going to do amen talk about the car that can drive by itself and all of this amen the eyes of being able to tell people what's wrong with them and everything else and he says you know as uh the the body was coming closer to perfection closer to the perfection more like christ more like christ it was a restoration and as a body we've had the perfect reflection of jesus christ with complete of jesus christ in that body or can we say at least a portion of that body because i do know that belief that it's got to be in all of the body amen the whole body you and i include it because we are a part of that body amen and day without us cannot be made perfect what was the last part beyond the eyes where did we go beyond the eyes huh because even the pentecostals even the pentecostals hey they would come to the meetings they would support the service as long as there was healing going on discernment and going on but when it came to this part here where what is that your brain your mind the mind that's when the seven seals were open and the mind of god was made open we understood where denominational is from and it's actually a mark of the beast it's actually the catholic church is the mother of harlots and any church that goes astray away from the word of god is a prostitute amen and he began to open that stuff up he began to say no i seen which doctors speak in tongues have pens writing unknown tongue and unknown tongues and interpret and so forth so don't tell me speaking in tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost the bible don't tell that that's what denominations what they made out of it in the right and when he's brought out the truth of it all they couldn't take that anymore they rejected the mind part of it amen the truth the word the opening of the seals they rejected that amen but what is it i was just in closing i just wanted to show you that as far as the body part we have had such a reflection in the body of jesus christ until brother branham had to straighten him up just like john the baptist they came to john the baptist says are you the messiah he says no there's one standing among you that i'm not worthy of the losing his shoot i am the voice of one care i knew in the wilderness and they almost took john the baptist perhaps as being a messiah and it was the same way with the prophet of god because look at the prophet of god in this generation how did god would you have discernment and do the messiah sign hundreds and thousands of times and people tried to make brother branham god isn't that right you are jesus you're christ he says don't you ever do it i'll come off the field and i won't preach anymore and all of that will be on you if you don't stop that because if you make me christ you make me an antichrist he says don't call me dr branham don't call me dr reverend this that or the other if you love me just call me brother because i am just your brother that's where the prophet of god stayed he stayed down in the damascus dust he didn't have to have a title he didn't have to have a great big name he's just a sinner saved by grace no better than the man that was saved yesterday amen a perfect reflection because there was a perfect preeminence of the holy spirit in his life how many believes that before we go the holy spirit will have that in your life he'll have that in my life he'll have the perfect preeminence god bless you let's stand musicians if you would come how many believes that the lord sees your heart he knows what you're thinking and how many would just say to the lord lord jesus i really do need to let you have more preeminences i want to give you every all preeminences in my life every part of my life lord it doesn't matter what it is don't matter if it's work don't no matter if it's home between me and my wife my children my neighbors wherever i am whatever it is i want you to have complete preeminences in my life god bless those hands how about all hands lord jesus you see every hand lord mine is up father for i want to see you have the greater yet preeminences in my life lord father no matter what you want me to turn whatever you want me to say whatever you want me to do lord however we just give you full permission to take control for lord we know that you know how best to operate our lives and lord we just want to surrender our lips our heart our mind our body everything to you tonight saying god please take complete preeminence as lord jesus for we know the last thing that you're going to do the third part is father to come take us home and to take these kingdoms over and lord we ask god that you'd help us to be ready for that time for we know that it is right around the corner lord time is coming to an end lord jesus we're getting ready for eternity and to actually behold let our eyes behold what's over there lord and what you have in store for them that love you and we ask god give us a greater love father for you lord you have the preeminence let us help us god that we might in every aspect of our life lord you would have to be these the super the superior one lord jesus superior in everything father we give you that permission we surrender to you lord in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you david [Music] you
