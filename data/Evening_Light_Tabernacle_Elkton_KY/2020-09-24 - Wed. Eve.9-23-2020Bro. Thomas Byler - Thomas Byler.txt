service in a word of prayer tonight brother willie amen uh i about three weeks ago maybe even a month this course i woke up singing this song and i still don't know where i ever heard it at and of course me being stubborn like i do and thinking i could remember instead of writing it down i didn't and it two or three different times and janet told me of the morning nights was telling her about it while we were eating breakfast before she went to work and i did and she said why don't you just write it down and try to find it so i didn't come up very simple and it's called more than ever before and sister donna's got the words and i think a couple of the words are a little different than what we go ahead and put that up sister donna and this i still don't know but it just began to be in my heart and i just wake up singing this i didn't know if i was singing the right words to it or not [Music] and it just began to just keep on and on and on and on and on i don't know how many times i've listened to it i've sung it since i've got the words and it says more than ever before lord i love you more than ever before lord i need you and more than ever before i want to tell you dear lord i love you now more than ever before and that just began to just in my heart i said lord i love you i thank you for your goodness i don't know about you but if there's one thing that excites me of the morning is when a song burns in my heart something from the lord burns in my heart soon as i wake up i know i may not have the best day but i know there's just something that just it just stirs my heart to know that he speaks to me as soon as i wake up because he wants me to talk to him it may not mean nothing to you but it means the world to me amen we're going to try to sing it if we

that's everybody's desire amen is for the lord to come and to fill your cup amen i don't have any doubts but that's what your desire is that's what the lord will do because i believe that's what he's amen continues to do just as he did um with his disciples amen if you all remember amen he fried him some fish you know right and man and they were out in the boat and they seen it was the lord and he said what was it that he said come and dine amen come and dine amen i'm gonna come and dine tonight amen god bless you good to have everybody back from florida amen trust you all had a good safe trip amen and so praise the lord how about that nice fall weather it's pretty nice and praise the lord certainly enjoying it the lord has given us some really nice weather by the grace of god certainly enjoying it amen amen so i can't think of any announcement so let's just bow our heads kind of heavenly father we once again approach your throne of grace thank the lord jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together lord with one another and with you and your spirit being here lord in a special way father and just asking god that as we yield ourselves to you that you just use this father and to speak your word the words that need to be said what you want to say father to the church tonight lord and we ask god that everybody here lord they have their hearts open to receive what you have for them and lord that we'd come from go from here better people than what we've come and that we'd be able to say like those did come on the road to emmaus amenity after he had talked with them and it was all said and done it did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way father maybe that be our testimony that we can say lord jesus we're grateful god that you spoke to us on this wednesday night by the way of your word father we ask god that you just bless meditation of our heart and that which i feel you've laid upon my heart to speak tonight we ask your blessing upon your word father anointed this lord to be able to minister it not in jesus christ's name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will to ephesians amen and this is going to be i'm in just a little bit uh i don't know i don't want to say different amen but if the subject is perhaps just a little different amen but trust it'll be a blessing in ephesians five and verse 15. see then redeeming the time because the days are evil one more scripture that i have tonight and that's over in saint john the sixth chapter saint john 6 and donna just in case you're wondering the title we'll call it redeeming the time saint john 6 25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when came is thou hither jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled lay burn not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give you give unto you for him that hath god for him hath god the father sealed may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated redeeming the time amen so tonight we want to speak on uh we want to talk about time first of all i want to talk about stress pressure and perhaps releasing of that pressure amen but the main thing i want to dwell on for a little while is going to be and i guess where my thought originated from the way i started on this thought with the quote that i remember but i've been making and how that he said that jesus was never in a hurry amen he was never in a hurry so i began to think about that jesus was never in a hurry so i began to look up a few quotes and the different things that he said about that and so brother bannon makes a statement he says we're the only one in a hurry he says god is never in a hurry he let the hebrew children walk into the fiery furnace before he done anything about it amen i believe um there is a plaque probably some of you all might have it in your kitchen i don't know but i've seen it before he says you know if it wasn't for the last minute i wouldn't get nothing done now right how many is kind of like that you know we always wait for the last minute and then we just have to hurry and rush and so you know and the one thing i want to talk about is talks about redeeming or bringing back to time taking back time and i think every one of us probably are very familiar with the statement we probably make it a lot of times and that is this one thing that we don't have a lot of times we don't have it and that is i don't have time right i just got i don't have any time how many is that way in your life you just you're out of time you know i i don't have time for that i don't have time for this you know your time is all taken up you know and so it's a very busy very very busy time that we're living in and so we want to talk about the consequences the results of not having time and that and being in a hurry we know [Music] that time has seems to have sped up i guess if sped up it's a word uh it's it has speeded up or sped up amen and so uh you know because you used to and i will never forget especially where i come from you know because we take a day and we load up a box wag in the corn and we'd harness the horses and what our day would pretty much consist of is going about a mile with a load of corn maybe a few bags of wheat and different things going down the feed mill and have that all shelled you know because we had they'd have to shell that corn for us because it was on the cob because that's the way we did it we didn't have a way to shell it and the whole day consisted of us just going and getting a load of grain for the animals you know and other things a lot of things you'd do and it would take the whole day you know and so uh you know because they were not in a hurry we used to not be in a hurry amen and brother brahm says a lot about this he talks about you know we used to visit the neighbor and and help somebody out but we don't have time for that anymore people don't take that time anymore and they're right so uh you know and we realized that it's just time is a precious thing but let me talk about this for just a few minutes god is never in a hurry and we think about several different things that god is not even at this present time i thought about noah before we talked to praise about the present time let's talk about noah back way back in the day you know how that after he uh called noah how that he was not in a hurry about destroying the world how many knows that after he made the announcement of noah to build that ark you know it took him a hundred and twenty years how many knows i mean a lot of people maybe if they lived a hundred years it'd still live out their life and never see it you know and so i guess maybe in that hour they may have lived longer than that if i'm not wrong it was i'm thinking that it was perhaps after the flood if i'm not wrong uh that the life spans begin to dwindle a lot you know before that we realized methuselah and a lot of those up to noah enoch and those they live many hundred years so but anyway so we see how god was really not in a hurry he took his time and so we look even in our day and i was thinking today aiming out there as i was just thinking on the lord i thought you know lord here here we are expecting the coming of the lord and it's already since the departing of the prophet of god it's been around 55 years that's a long time you know because how many know that brother branham expected at any time and you read souls in prison now and he was talking about it could possibly be that we're in that time era where there is no more mercy anymore he even looked at it that way could it possibly be and it you know it scared the people to death i mean the altars were full right because they thought well i don't want to miss it and i want to be right you know if this is the time you know where he's actually preaching to the total lost and so it was that close but it ran a man in the moses imagine you look at it news talking about how close the coming of the lord is here we are 55 years later you know and i was just i guess three years old two three about three years old whenever brother band passed away so i'm glad that the lord didn't come before or or perhaps as a baby i went on to heaven but you know you know i still uh you know we got to live and we got to experience the salvation of the lord and and you look at the thousands and the millions that's come in through africa and all the different places and the things that's been done since then and then i begin to wonder well you know uh it was 120 years for noah before the whole world was destroyed and we know that this is even more cataclysmic than his time was because it's not just going to bring water upon the earth but it's going to bring volcanoes and eruptions and it's going to change the whole surface of the earth it's going to bring in the millennium we're not just changing a little bit here it's a complete renovation of the earth so you know i thought well i don't know just how long it will go how many of them says you know it might be ten years might be five years might be a hundred years he says nobody knows you don't know we don't know just how long it'll be but you do we can't see the signs of the times and emma and i were thinking today of how that when you look at the signs of the times and where we're at and and i thought of our own government you know the way they're operating it's almost like watching a completely drunk man trying to walk down the street and keep his people keep saying enough you know have y'all ever seen a real drunk person you know and just all of a sudden better they have to fall over into the bush and that's what our our government is acting like right now and that right they're staggering trying to stay up you know trying to stay on two feet you know just staggering around like a drunk person the whole system why because it's fixing the fall isn't the right so you know we know the fall is coming but that's where the world is the world is like that and it's a terrible place but okay so let's go on so we think about that think about knowing how that he took that long he was in no hurry he was no worry for the three hebrew children a lot of times i believe it was in brother branham's message called be certain of god where brother braham says you know sometimes we pray for things and we undercover every closet and we get all the skeletons out of our club we try to make everything right that we know of to make right we want god to answer a prayer and it just seems like god doesn't answer and you don't answer and you don't ask you know what i said go back and listen to the tape you know and he says you know it's he talks about how to you know he just goes on so long and and we wonder well is god going to god even there or whatever and better bam says you know god is just testing your faith he's just testing your faith god's that way don't get enough let me just say this don't get in a hurry with god or you're going to be disappointed many things he says about getting in too much of a hurry how did the people get too much of a hurry they missed theirs they mis they're healing they miss all kinds of things we get to get too much of a rush they get in too much of a hurry and i believe that's where the world is that's where i believe a lot of christians are and i hope those listening to the tape tonight in this evening like that but hear this that that's probably where we're at and i hope this message will get to every one of us amen and because i want to talk about being in too much of a rush and the consequences of it amen and so we got to redeem the time we got to bring back some of the time amen that causes us not to be what we're supposed to be and that's where the devil wants us to be where we're not supposed to be or shouldn't be because we don't have time for the right thing and that's why i read that about amen jesus even say you know they came again and he said jesus you came for that he says but don't labor so much for the good fish and the good steaks and the ribeye don't labor so much for that but labor for god isn't that right labor for the meat that does not perish labor for the meat that spend time for the things that are eternal because sooner or later the one thing that is for sure for you and me and for everybody it means that as time is coming when our time is going to end just as it has all generations before us and the only thing that's going to matter is how you lived your life for the lord only what's done for christ will last but we can get so busy and so fast and even better bam talking about preaching and i have learned in the pulpit that you know i used to try to preach 50 000 miles an hour but i read you know and even better brandon i read today he says you know i was listening to myself on tape and he says you know i was in such a rush i hurried and it wasn't so much i didn't like what i was saying but it was the way that i was saying it and sometimes you have to just slow down slow yourself down calm down amen and let the holy spirit have his way because god's not in a hurry amen he wasn't in a hurry for daniel he wasn't in a hurry for three hebrew children amen and many times for abraham he wasn't even in a hurry it was 25 years after he made him the promise that it actually come to pass it was a very long time many people many people come to the altar hello and if it didn't happen by the next morning or the next day they then lost their faith and that's why they lost their faith is because they didn't have in the first place they thought it would expect immediately it would happen now god can do it immediately i'm gonna know that but also sometimes it takes time just like the two women brother ben i mean talking about hurrying and don't be in such a rush he talks about the two women if you remember that were prayed for and pronounced a blessing upon is that right um brother ben says sometimes when a blessing is pronounced it's pronounced upon you he says it has to happen but we're the one in a hurry and that's why i picked that up amen and that blessing was pronounced upon those two sisters and you know it was several weeks later i could have been mine but it was several weeks later and forgive me for not being sure here but i'm thinking they came back to brother venom and wondered about it and they said just keep your faith just keep believing is that right so they went back and they just kept believing and sure enough one morning the one sister sitting in her kitchen or being in her kitchen began to feel this strange feeling coming over isn't that right and uh stomach problem amen that hurt and everything began to go away and then it was completely left and she went and she made her some coffee made her some eggs made some toast began to eat it and she was perfect to find it by the time she got down to her neighbor and then she was looking for that thing i was on her throat in the sheets and they're right she couldn't find it it was all gone because that angel came by but it took time for it to happen how many believes that if you really believe it with all of your heart just give it time gotta get around to it he's not in a hurry he's in eternity amen and you and i are looking for the time amen when we'll be in the place that our loved ones are at because we know but says there's no yesterday there's no tomorrow isn't that right there's no past the future you're just in the present you're not in time at all that's what we're looking for all right so let's look at a couple of results i mean of not having time and getting in a hurry all right now brother bam says scenes change and we notice that people change all right now how many knows that uh if you aren't careful if you are at your best that you know of that you've been as a christian okay you're friendly to everybody you love everybody amen because people aren't even friendly anymore you know right people don't have time to be friendly people don't smile people don't have joy anymore why suburban says people change amen so whatever god gives you something or brings you to a place i mean it's the devil's place to change you from what you ought to be it's a good thing for every one of us to ask ourselves tonight are you what you used to be or have you gotten worse now if you've gotten better that's that's just great but if you got worse then it's you've gone the wrong way you've changed like brother brown says that you have people change and it's god so that the people are not even friendly like they used to be amen i don't know whether you notice it or not here or not but we sure notice it back in the south and in the east people are changing year by year then he says the very next statement he says they're in too much they're too much of a hurry too much of a hurry people ain't got a time to look at the other car going down the road see who it was or think about waving not today got time for that gotta hurry up to where we're going right people don't wave they're not friendly at the store passing people how many knows you know it's gotten to where i probably a lot of times don't do it i just walk right on but people don't like eye contact anymore they're not they're not friendly they just you know it's sad in it they've changed now notice he says they are just got to hurry up and get this done and that done he says it's change oh they're in a hurry where are they going and then he says if you'll notice that most women today most of the women today was has washing machines and electric ironers and push-button dishwashers and everything like that and yet they got less time to pray than they've ever had all right let me ask everybody out there a question how many how much time did you take this week how many chapters in the bible did you read ask yourself that if you didn't it's because you didn't take time to do it maybe you thought you didn't have time amen that's what how many knows it's easy to get away from do you think the important things how many because it's important so he says last time the prayer that they ever did susan wesley had 17 children packing the water from us bringing washing on her hands and yet she could find two or three hours a day to pray with her children and out there came with john and a charles wesley that right she had time to raise him right how many knows that we don't the women anymore don't have time to raise their children they got to go off and work because they're under so much stress they're under so much pressure there's so much to be done it's so hard to keep up with everything it's very hard for a man that doesn't have a very good paying job to make a house payment a car payment the insurance or not at all and to keep it all up it's pretty hard isn't that right and so as brother brahm says most of them are out there in the workforces and so forth amen and not taken at home taking the children all right so he says and he uses her for an example that she what she still redeemed some time like i said and even brother batman says you know the horse and muggy days people had a lot more time back there than today look at the brother bam says people are are racing down the streets at breakneck next speeds anymore chris you know you the only kind that's down in the streets down there is the quicken the dead if you aren't quick you're another word it's dangerous it's dangerous to be safe not that you shouldn't you should and that right but he was just giving an illustration of the pace that people are running full speed amen all right people are running at full speed they don't have time anymore for god to slow down to rest and one of the things that made me think of this is that you know god made us to rest a little not to be under too much pressure not to be too stressed we weren't made to be that way he even in the old testament you know they were supposed to drop all of their work don't do nothing on the sabbath now right rest get some rest how many knows it really does you good to get some rest even and brother ma'am says sometimes in his own life he said you know that he would take off for what sometimes he'd say a month or two six weeks he would go squirrel hunting and just get away and he would just rest not have a bunch of meetings just rest is that right even he would get away in wrestling he says the scripture the scripture for it is what he even jesus said let us go aside into the mountain for a while in other words let's go rest for a while amen because people don't rest because people don't take a break and release the stress it brings them into a neurotic condition it makes people nervous i mean those pressure makes you nervous stress makes you nervous responsibility makes you nervous why it puts a load on you and people are getting completely strikes out until brother bam he makes the statement he says that we're living in a neurotic age a neurotic age that we're living in nervous tension everybody's racing here and going there and yet going nowhere it's just that kind of age amen he says and i know this church is plagued with it everybody's plagued with it the tabernacle's pl with the whole world he says it's a day of pressure stress then says everything's hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up amen that's right that's everything and in that rushing brother bam says it's the time we're living he says and in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension amen amen when you are rushed when you have to hurry like brother man says jesus never was god ain't no worry when you get in too much of a hurry it causes you to be stressed out when you get stressed out brother bam says that you get nervous and you'll be under pressure and a wife will say something a little contrary and boy you'll fly off he says it'll bring temper. how many know that when you're stressed out that's when it's easy to get impatient i'm still learning it amen that whenever something happens and so forth i'm trying to make a goal it's so easy to get stressed out in a temporary and you got to look at it you got to think of it in a different way you got to be patient but people fly off husbands say something and boy i'll tell you what there he goes amen wife oh i'm so nervous see what's the matter all of this together but abram says detention building up all right it builds tension up then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place how many believes it that when you don't have time to pray and all people brother bob says you know people get so stressed out and even the psychiatrists are stressed out until they have to have psychiatrists for them and people get stressed out and they'll go to the beer joints and try to drink it off and this makes it worse people will do drugs and everything else to try to release some of this stress because they don't have time because why they've got their schedules so full they don't have any time they ain't got time to release the pressure in the way that they're supposed to release it amen the results is that people act out of place they snap at each other and that right you get snappy you get short you get nervous stressed how many knows that's not how jesus needs you to be jesus don't need you stressed out he don't eat new snappy and short and temporary that's not how god wants you to be he wants you to be in peace and calm that's how i want you to be that's how christians live live in peace let the peace of god rule in your heart amen but no the devil's got the world so busy until they don't have no time there stresses them out too much responsibility and listen to what he says that's right people acting out of place now it'll make the poor act that way huh you know and it's usually let me say this and i truly believe that a lot of the stress and a lot of the problems comes from poor people is because they don't have anything they want stuff and man they are some of the fightness folks yeah there's some of the unhappiest people in the world as poor people because they don't have anything but listen so it'll make them act that way it'll make poor people act that way and it'll make the middle class act that way amen and you know you can just thank the lord that you don't have too much stress because i don't believe any human being was meant to take too much stress brother keith was telling me a story one time of a husband that just really was mean to her his wife a tree half naked whooper and everything else in the cold huh just treated her terribly and one day the cops had to show up at the house because the man had an ax buried in his head she killed him she couldn't take it no more right pressure stress human beings can only take so much amen we weren't meant to be under that kind of stress amen not under too much pressure now how many knows brother bam says god loves to put us under pressure but i'll tell you what whenever you learn how to use that how to set your wings in the wind of the trials that come your way you can have a smile in the midst of your trials but listen brother brown directly con connects the hurry hurry no time type of thing and it says that this is the results that it gets these people get snappy people can snap at each other they fuss they fight because they're nervous they're stressed out that's not the way that a christian home is supposed to be that right that's right amen let me just say this it comes to my mind is it all right we haven't learned anything as a husband and a wife if we haven't learned that if your husband is upset it's not going to make it any better for you to get upset or if your wife is upset it isn't going to do any good for you to get upset one can i have a witness that's right what happens it just clashes it just boils up you know sure you both make up because you know that's why there's so many divorces you know and that's what i would want to ask every young person that ever gets mad hey you realize you're going to clash sooner or later you're going to have your fights you're going to want to divorce her she's going to want to divorce you i really hate you you might get to that place most likely your marriage sooner or later get to that place but you got to ask yourself if you're really a christian hello if you really love god what are you going to do then because that's when you got to stick together that's when you gotta as the husband say i'm sorry honey that i got so mad i'm sorry i got upset or as a wife i'm sorry you gotta make up because i'd love to tell you hey marriage and all of that is so hunky-dory that you never have to face any of that but that be lying to you amen amen and the sooner that everybody learns that hey if the other one is upset and stressed you need to do what the prophet did when his wife was stressed out under so much pressure amen and the kids were screaming and everything else you know and she didn't have food cooked isn't that right the house was all dirty now what would have to down if brother bannon went in there and said do you mean you haven't had supper for me and this out of the other huh but no he had dealt with it in the right way it changes your whole life like i said it was just a thought that comes to my mind i hope that'll help somebody somewhere along the way all right so he says look it'll make the middle class that way it'll make the rich act that way when tension builds up when there's no time when you're hurrying too much it'll make the wrong people like that rat and it'll make the pretty good act that way praise pizza god i'm glad he's didn't mention the good people aren't you now it ain't gonna make the good people that way is it let me see and it'll make the good act that way too much pressure not enough time haven't been praying like you should haven't been under the sweetness of the holy spirit enough i don't care how good you are it's gonna make you act that way if you don't got time if you let tension build up that way it's going to make you act out of the way in the way that you shouldn't act amen it'll make the good act that way because it's tension it's steam built up he says it's got to blow out somewhere see if you don't you blow up the boiler amen praise the lord it's exactly right amen husband how often has your wife i don't know how much i can take this anymore i don't i'm really getting i really getting stressed you asked my husband's ever hear your wife say that mine said that a many times better pay attention say well what do i need to do what i need to do release that pressure because she has pressure moms have pressure raising kids is pressure all the things that we do it all comes up with pressure amen praise the lord then he goes talking about the kids or the boss amen it all builds up ooh mice see you feel like you're gonna your head's gonna come off i know i'm with it every day i know what it means it builds up how many knows we're living in an hour when so many things demand our time you have to give so much time to this you got to give some so much time to that amen and i'll tell you what there's just not enough time to go around amen i'll tell you what i've come to the place i've been trying to do things at my place for small and i've got the different people that i've worked for and different things you know and and and just little things you know that hey this one will call and that one will call and this one will call and i said honey i believe i got all my little little things done i believe i'm good to go now i can actually start on some of the things i need to do you know but there's not enough time you know and i told her i said look somebody calls me wanting the job done sorry no time no time you know because why because you can get so busy amen until you don't have time to pray and that's why i asked a while ago how much time do we spend in prayer amen and all these things all right so let me go on here i won't hurry but i'll go on all right um no time no time for god i want to i want to quickly just well here i go you see how we're nature did satanist we were god we got really fast oh my all right so about three years ago batman says i was on a hunting trip and i had an old indian guy and i hunt real fast he says and that stuff that's just in me and one of them pressure builders you know and i was hunting with the indian and i dumped off my horse and i was up for uh there was some elk up there in the mountain i started around the bend and the old indian was about 10 years older than me he was just a puff and coming up behind me he says come on chief come on i said he's just too fast too fast i thought well i said come on and i started and he said too fast i slowed down to the next gear too fast and i got down to a walk too fast hey man i wonder if we don't need to do that a little bit tonight too fast too fast amen slow down slow down slow down because i'm telling you right now we want to leave this place we want to get out of time completely we need to be slowing down and get our time redeem it get it back whatever it is taking all your time now i'm going to say this to everybody in church is this slight rebuke i don't mean it to any individual at all this goes for all of us but anymore it's to where we don't even hardly have time to get up on a sunday morning and to get to church in time right people come in half hour after the service started we moved it up to 10 30 10 30 in the morning uh folks you know because brother brahm said what he said we should be here about 30 minutes early to what release some of the struts that we've been dealing with amen to pray to get down there quiet with the lord brother brahm says you know he don't even he goes to the office in the afternoon and he don't want nobody coming in there and serving him at all until service time why because he said the minister has to have that time away in that quiet time with the lord if he's going to come out here under the atmosphere of the holy ghost and do any good i believe that's the same way with the congregation if we come all stressed out not prayed up we're probably going to sit there not getting half of us what as much we would if we come early get up a little early amen and come a little early and try to see if we can't amen let the lord know how many of us appreciate god's what he's been doing in his services but he can do even more if you get that time bring that time back say this is my time amen too fast he says come on too fast on down to the oh just a walk oh i said chief the hell is up there and he said him staying there and praise the lord it'd be high amen he's dying he's taking his last breath he called for jesus twice and he still didn't come he didn't come there doctors finally gave up the ghost huh and jesus still didn't come so slow huh it wasn't even at the funeral hey most folks would be mad you didn't even come to the funeral no but no jesus knew what he was doing he was in a hurry to get there amen as brother branham one place put to put it as god's no hurry he even let jesus die on the cross and go to hell but guess what god lifted him up out of the hill and took him on to the ramparts everything turned out all right same way with lazarus come back he was three days late or four days late it was the fourth day begin to death corruption begin to set in and he comes and visits mary and martha can you imagine but stephen if your loved one died and he was your friend your best friend and then you have here comes that master that he wouldn't come and he comes and looks you in the eye you have to see him now you have to face mary mary faces jesus and as brother brown said if it had been a pentecostal she'd probably give him a piece of her mind all that stress and pressure would have caused it to blow but jesus brother brown said no mary wasn't like that she was nice she says we know that if you'd have been here he would have not died and even now whatever you ask we know god will give it and they're right she was respectful and god had done it jesus had done it for a very special very special reason you know right he didn't do it out of meanness no he did it for our purpose because he knew the glory of god would show and man four days late he would go to the tomb and say lazarus come forth he made up for all the late is that right there he was lazarus he's well again oh my what a time what a service what a revival to see something like that but he wasn't in a hurry and you brother about him here at elk hunt he was in a hurry i mean i think brother brother eddie biscuit one time said of me he says you know when they hunt at me he says it doesn't matter if we're going up a hill down the hill wherever we are he's walking five miles an hour i walk fast amen well i slipped down a little bit now no no sense to rush it amen amen i'll tell you what young people i was born and raised and i was doing concrete work laboring concrete uh blocks bricks and and making my way at 16 years old on my own right and i worked hard and i worked fast i wasn't going to have nobody take my job i wanted my job don't take my money i need money to pay for that trailer i'm in and for that little old nova that i had you know what i'm saying and everything fast worked for urban and martha you know and it was slave time lay it fast we got to get paddled down everything was fast everything was hard quick huh and i got a routine folks in a routine that almost my whole life whatever i did it had to be fast and i'm still trying to slow down and teach myself not so fast not so fast hey if you don't get done this week maybe it'll get done next week if you don't get done hey god i'm looking up maybe you don't need to get done but one thing's for sure the number one thing is is your spiritual status that's the most important thing in your life where are you with the lord all right so now i know it's not like this so he says that's right him was born up there i said i guess that's right he said him stay there him were born there he said preacher hunt too fast scare all the game away says do like the indian welcome once look them nine times all right one time all right you know how you look both ways when you're come to a stop sign always do that young people look twice amen two three four five six seven can we go yet eight my goodness eight nine all right all right now we passed some trees some rocks so we exposed ourselves a little more now let's look if we can see that well that's slow hey if we would be a little slower maybe we'd be a little better amen not so fast amen well i wonder what kind of a gear i'd have to get down to get down to there for i was up there in a mountain he says welcome ones look them nine times look all around over everything nine times before you make another set but my you see he's in no hurry amen he was in no worry just like jesus he's not in a hurry he's not in a rush final quote brother bab says you have to be desperate about it you have to really need god jesus said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled but as long as you're satisfied with the things of the world how can god ever speak to you and you say well god never spoke to me why he wants to are you with me tonight you say god don't speak to me when's the last time god spoke to you the other man says god wants to amen i believe god spoke to me what was it monday night actually it would have been tuesday morning about three o'clock in the morning is when he laid this on my heart i woke up at three o'clock and this began to go through my mind about jesus never been in a hurry about the sabbath about needing rest about all the stress and so forth and begin to just begin to pour out i thought here it is three o'clock in the morning amen and god spoke to me laid this message on my heart his ass asses why has god not spoke to you he says you're too filled up with the things of the world that's what's the matter with us today we put all of our time on the things of the world and the pleasures of the world and give no time to god how many please that's where our problem is if god ain't speaking to you if you don't hear that still small voice amen god's speaking to you something i don't know what it is just whatever it might be amen then it's because you really don't have time to listen signs are appearing jesus is coming great wonders are being done amen i'm going to say what just comes to mind i really like what brother daniel said and i've read it myself to where brother brown says that discernment that went forth he says those things he said those things should give us rapturing faith how many believes that signs wonders and these great uh you know the prophet being on the scene desert and so forth it is absolutely should give us rapturing faith amen much could be said now notice great wonders are being done every milestone is pointing towards this soon coming and it'll happen in a moment how are you standing this morning as we take inventory we should if we should uh be spoke to this morning and the lord jesus should descend from the heavens this morning with a shout should say this evening and the trump of god would we be found ready as a church body will we be found ready as an individual to join with those who are raised from the dead who have proven themselves ready because no matter whether we're ready or not the lord jesus will come just the same at the appointed time we must be ready and we must do it now it is no time to wait we must redeem the time and be ready redeem the time and i wrote down here just think when the rapture comes it will be putting foundations for houses and hotels marriages will be going on eating at the restaurants people will be busy working everywhere doing all kinds of things they'll be very very busy going and doing things when the rapture comes and takes his bride home they'll be doing all of those things the things that you see now so just be ready at any time honey believes it's time to take time and make time to be ready amen god bless you let's stand more important than anything else take back the time that satan takes from you or has taken from you tries to take from it he loves the devil just loves it when you're too busy to pray too busy to read your bible too busy to talk to the lord too busy to come to church amen too busy to think and keep your mind on the things of god he likes it that's all he wants the people to be he's going to have the people zipping and flying everywhere when the lord comes to take his little waiting by the way that he's got herself ready amen let's bow our heads and let the lord search your heart has he spoken to you lately are you where you should be if he's if trump of god should sound tonight would you go would you be ready or would she still say i need more time i need to get ready i've been too busy with this that or the other and just think the people that are being left here they didn't take the time to get ready they were too busy with other things but we don't want to be the church of god won't be that way that church of god i truly believe they make sure that they make time to be ready for their prayer life for their heart and their soul to be right with god for them to be on fire and be waiting for that call come up higher thomas byler come on up you your name come on up higher come on up someone's to come to disguise lay down your whatever it is you're doing it's time to come home now and we'll be glad we'll be saying oh lord i've been waiting for you to come i don't want to appeal this i don't want to do this or that or the other i want to come home i just want to be with you i'm just passing my time until you come how many tonight would say i i need to take i need to take back some of the time so that i have more time for god lord jesus you see the hands all over the building and those listening on the airwaves we ask god if they're in the same way that they just don't have the time to pray like they should or the things of god and they've gotten too busy with other things and it's caused them to have reactions and reactions and nervousness and everything else that shouldn't be in the christian's life we ask god that you look at every heart tonight every hand that's up lord and father forgive us of where we have taken too much time with other things and not enough time with you lord jesus we thank you father that you give us time to read and to meditate lord to feed on your word and to listen to your voice that's in our hearts lord jesus and i pray tonight god that everybody here under the sun in my voice would learn to hear to listen heed it and to follow it and lord we know it will guide them right your spirit always guides every individual right lord and we ask god for that true leadership the holy spirit in your church and your people father we ask god that you'd help us from this night on not to be in such a hurry lord help us to be calm in everything lord jesus and we love you lord jesus and ask god that you just blessed now in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you brother david with all of your heart
