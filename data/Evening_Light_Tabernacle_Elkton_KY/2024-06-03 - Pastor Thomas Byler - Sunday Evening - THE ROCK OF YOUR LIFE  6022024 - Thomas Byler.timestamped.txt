[40:54] 16 me I I titled it the rock of your
[40:58] life the rock of our life
[41:01] amen and
[41:03] so
[41:08] amen 16 and
[41:11] 13 all right that's
[41:14] okay when Jesus Come into the coast of
[41:17] cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[41:20] saying who do men say that I the son of
[41:23] man am and they said some say that thou
[41:26] art John the Baptist and some Elias and
[41:30] others jeremias or one of the prophets
[41:33] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[41:36] that I am and Simon Peter answered and
[41:39] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[41:41] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[41:43] unto him blessed art thou Simon bar
[41:46] Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[41:48] revealed this unto thee but my Father
[41:50] which is in heaven and I say unto thee
[41:53] that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock
[41:55] I'll build my church and the gates of
[41:57] Hell shall not Prevail against it may
[42:00] God add His blessings to the reading of
[42:01] the word you can be seated tonight I'm
[42:04] going to say a lot of things that we've
[42:05] heard before amen but and it may seem
[42:09] kind of like of a deep subject talking
[42:11] about Revelation to our young people
[42:14] amen but the thing of it is amen it is
[42:17] the thing that is the anchor for your
[42:20] soul so it's very very important amen
[42:24] amen I've got wrote here you know the
[42:26] first thing about young people is that
[42:29] you should be thankful if God has given
[42:31] you Godly Parents amen because your
[42:35] chances of turning out right coming out
[42:38] right uh having a good life uh or ending
[42:42] up being alive hello are greatly
[42:46] increased because you have Godly Parents
[42:49] amen because there's only two things
[42:50] that's going to happen in in your life
[42:53] amen you're going to end up living
[42:55] forever or you're going to end up in
[42:56] dead death how many believe there's only
[42:58] two paths one is to life and one is to
[43:02] death amen so if you have Godly Parents
[43:05] be thankful for Godly Parents amen
[43:09] praise the Lord because we just PE kids
[43:12] nowadays don't
[43:13] realize uh that if you don't have Godly
[43:17] Parents and I will say this that
[43:19] probably different ones of us have seen
[43:21] even people that have left the church
[43:22] here parents that have left God left the
[43:25] church amen and there kids are scattered
[43:28] and there ain't no telling what they are
[43:30] amen amen so if you don't have a rock am
[43:33] me church is a rock of your life amen
[43:36] amen to come to church and because
[43:38] that's where you find out really what
[43:40] The Rock is isn't that right
[43:43] amen so praise the Lord I want to just
[43:46] read you some a few things the
[43:48] importance let me talk to you about the
[43:50] importance amen of that rock but let me
[43:52] let me just say a few more things here
[43:55] amen young people as you get to be a
[43:58] teenager as you get to be a teenagers
[44:01] and you go through times of uh you have
[44:04] a lot of questions you have a lot of
[44:07] whse why this and why that why do we
[44:10] have to do this and why do we have to do
[44:11] that there's a lot of things that you're
[44:14] not going to be sure about maybe
[44:17] yourself lot of insecurities a lot of
[44:20] unsureness a that right and it's a whole
[44:24] lot like what happened in the Garden of
[44:26] Eden now at one time Adam and Eve they
[44:29] were in perfect life they never had one
[44:32] question they had no wise no ifs no
[44:35] confusions of any kind am that right but
[44:38] after the fall amen we realize that they
[44:41] we went into darkness amen and then I
[44:44] want to try to try to get this to you
[44:47] that life is about you being able to say
[44:51] oh I
[44:52] see oh I understand now it's kind of
[44:55] like your parents or your teachers
[44:57] trying to teach you a certain problem
[44:59] that you have and you can't figure this
[45:02] problem
[45:03] out you don't really know what you know
[45:06] how to solve this problem but that
[45:07] teacher will tell you well you put these
[45:09] two together you put them together and
[45:11] all of a sudden the light comes on and
[45:12] you're like oh yeah I know how to do
[45:16] that you know and it just all of a
[45:20] sudden you light up and you understand
[45:22] it and that's what the whole Christian
[45:24] principle is is about having the eyes of
[45:26] your understanding come
[45:30] open amen and your parents you know in
[45:34] the spiritual realm in the spiritual
[45:37] realm there's things that your parents
[45:39] can never teach
[45:41] you they can tell you
[45:44] intellectually is that right they can
[45:46] intellectually tell you or the pastor
[45:49] might intellectually tell you but
[45:51] there's things that has to be done and
[45:53] showed you by God himself
[45:57] and really that's the only thing that's
[45:59] going to be an anchor for you that the
[46:02] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[46:05] it amen you are like a ship each and
[46:08] every one of us is like a ship on the
[46:10] ocean brother brandham talked about it
[46:12] when he was flying over top of this
[46:14] ocean and there was a ship down there
[46:16] amen and the storms were coming and
[46:18] hitting it ain't that right and you're
[46:21] going to have storms in your life you
[46:23] have all kinds of things that you got to
[46:25] overcome amen boy I'm jumping around now
[46:27] I haven't finished my story of the
[46:29] Garden of Eden but
[46:31] anyway uh storms will come questions
[46:35] will come hard times will come but he
[46:38] says you know if that that boat it would
[46:41] sink it would actually maybe turn
[46:43] sideways or whatever and flip over and
[46:45] those waves would actually cause that
[46:47] boat to sink and he was asking of
[46:49] somebody beside and he says what keeps
[46:51] that what keeps that ship from sinking
[46:53] he says well it's got a sea
[46:55] anchor right right it's got an
[46:58] anchor amen how many believes you got to
[47:00] have an anchor but you got to have
[47:01] something that that anchor holds on
[47:05] to and I want to call that you know that
[47:08] you've got to have an absolute in your
[47:11] life if you don't have an absolute then
[47:14] look at out there at Walmart go to
[47:16] Walmart and look at what people look
[47:17] like when they don't have an
[47:21] absolute they have been flown over and
[47:25] and flipped over so bad their brains
[47:27] have
[47:29] flipped huh the guys don't know if
[47:32] they're a girl or girls don't know if
[47:34] they're guy and they get mad at you if
[47:37] you tell them that you know they've lost
[47:38] their mind you've lost your mind if
[47:41] you're listening that's exactly right if
[47:44] you don't know if you're a boy or girl
[47:46] you have done went
[47:49] insane come on folks we won't get
[47:51] personal about where you need to go to
[47:53] check and find out but I'm here to tell
[47:55] you it's about time somebody knows which
[47:58] side of the fence they belong
[48:00] on Amen it's pretty simple
[48:03] really they want to have debates and all
[48:05] of this other stuff but pretty bad
[48:08] though they're tossed no telling and
[48:11] then you come to the age brother Paul
[48:13] brother Daniel you all come to the age
[48:15] Gideon all of you that right right now
[48:20] you know who your anchor is where's your
[48:22] anchor right
[48:23] now well once you come to the age of
[48:25] accountability it better be Christ but
[48:28] as long as you're with your parents you
[48:31] may not have the Holy Ghost but how
[48:32] many's heard they'll be your Holy Ghost
[48:35] for
[48:36] you they will be your answer for
[48:39] you they will keep you uh from having a
[48:43] phone if you don't need to have a phone
[48:44] because they're going to watch it make
[48:46] sure that your mind doesn't get
[48:48] corrupted they're going to give you
[48:50] security they're going to be there to
[48:52] help you if you fall down if you hurt
[48:54] yourself and you're are protection is
[48:56] there by your parents your anchor is
[48:59] your
[49:02] parents there even your Holy Ghost so to
[49:05] speak until you get the Holy Ghost but
[49:07] there comes a crossroad time ain't that
[49:10] right let me go back before the
[49:12] crossroad a little bit after Adam and
[49:14] Eve fell see brother bam said that in
[49:17] the age that we're living now ever since
[49:19] the fall we have been living in this is
[49:23] for us adults a little bit we've been
[49:24] living in the nighttime
[49:28] how many believes it's
[49:30] dark it's actually dark time it's like
[49:35] overnight everything went
[49:40] dark so much so that even the genetics
[49:44] of the trees and genetics of Adam and
[49:47] Eve
[49:49] changed from never getting old now their
[49:52] genetics changed to where now to get old
[49:54] is't that right all of the Animal
[49:57] Kingdom of the trees everything anything
[49:59] everything death came in when that curse
[50:01] is lifted again those genetics will
[50:03] change how many is looking for a genetic
[50:06] change for that curse to be lifted but
[50:09] we're living in the
[50:11] nighttime anden it's Darkness
[50:14] everywhere it was so dark Adam one time
[50:17] didn't know what to scary Amen in the
[50:20] night time and uh uh you know even as
[50:23] you think sometimes well I'm not sure
[50:25] Mom I'm not sure dad your insecurities
[50:27] and your unsureness and and maybe your
[50:31] condemnation but part of that darkness
[50:33] is condemnation part of that darkness is
[50:37] guilt just being guilty is a terrible
[50:40] thing just having a guilty conscience is
[50:43] a terrible thing having condemnation in
[50:47] your life then there's fear of judgment
[50:49] there's fear of death is that right it's
[50:53] a terrible World scary and spooky world
[50:57] at night why do you think people are so
[50:59] scared of the
[51:01] night oh Mommy I want to sleep with you
[51:03] I'm scared of the
[51:05] dark right why because the night is
[51:10] scary amen and I want to talk to you a
[51:12] little if I can take my time but there's
[51:15] been several times that God has amen
[51:18] that there's been a rising of the Sun
[51:20] that there's been a
[51:22] day that light came again brother B even
[51:26] Illustrated talking about how that men
[51:28] always feared death you know and it was
[51:30] kind of a Spooky World and everybody's
[51:33] got all these superstitions and
[51:34] basically a lot of religions still have
[51:36] their
[51:39] superstitions is that right Catholicism
[51:41] especially Amish ISM also all of that
[51:44] they have their
[51:46] Superstition you know like there's going
[51:48] to be when you die you know you're going
[51:49] to uh you know they go to purgatory and
[51:52] all of this other stuff and boy they
[51:54] were real smart weren't they if the give
[51:57] the preacher some more money he'll pray
[51:59] a and get your relative out of purgatory
[52:02] now there's some money hungry preachers
[52:04] right there isn't it that's exactly what
[52:06] Catholicism was and John Martin Luther
[52:08] broke away said Christ paid for my sin
[52:13] you know and there ain't no Purgatory
[52:14] this is Purgatory brother Bram said a
[52:17] purging where you purge yourself and get
[52:20] clean and so forth how many believe
[52:22] that but so for the longest time for
[52:25] thousands of years it it was a Spooky
[52:27] Night amen people and people's heart was
[52:31] dark see young people you're either
[52:33] going to live in darkness or you going
[52:34] to live in
[52:36] light
[52:37] amen see Isaiah 60 says arise and shine
[52:41] for thy light is come and the glory of
[52:43] the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold
[52:46] The Darkness shall cover the Earth and
[52:48] gross Darkness the people oh yeah we got
[52:52] light out there looks what do you mean
[52:53] light we mean it's all dark no in the
[52:55] spiritual well there's gross
[52:58] darkness in other words it's the darkest
[53:01] just before the day brother bam
[53:02] explained that right now it's darker
[53:05] than it's ever been so much so that he
[53:10] said that he said in this
[53:12] Lea
[53:15] age do you see any light in
[53:19] there I believe this spirit said it's
[53:21] complete it gets goes completely dark
[53:24] here amen
[53:28] when what what does that symbolize it
[53:29] symbolizes that the holy spirit is
[53:32] lifted the church is gone no more light
[53:36] and then he goes for three and a half
[53:37] years to Israel isn't that right so they
[53:40] get a little bit of light God says put a
[53:42] little bit of sliver of light in there
[53:44] put a little slivering light in there
[53:46] when them prove prophesy then it's total
[53:49] darkness amen
[53:56] so what is this
[53:58] Darkness this darkness is in the minds
[54:01] of the people this darkness is in the
[54:03] hearts of the people
[54:09] amen just like let let me just amen I'm
[54:13] GNA take my time okay I'm getting ahead
[54:15] of myself a little
[54:19] bit basically I want to talk to you a
[54:21] little bit with the help of the Lord
[54:23] about the
[54:24] importance of Revelation
[54:27] the
[54:28] importance of it
[54:32] amen all right where we at
[54:34] here notice he says in the Greek word
[54:37] for Revelation is apocalypse which means
[54:41] unveiling this unveiling is perfectly
[54:44] described in the example of a sculpture
[54:47] unveiling his work of staty exposing it
[54:51] to the onlooker it is an
[54:55] uncovering amen an
[54:58] uncovering
[55:00] amen and Enlightenment just like I said
[55:03] once uh it is something that has
[55:06] previously been hid now it's made known
[55:09] now it's shown it was covered over now
[55:12] it's unveiled it's to take the cover off
[55:16] of
[55:17] something amen how many knows that the
[55:20] God has to take our children and he has
[55:23] to open their eyes he's got to take that
[55:26] cover off mama can't do it Daddy can't
[55:28] do it preacher can't do it only God can
[55:31] do it and their
[55:34] choice it has to be their choice
[55:38] amen he reached that crossroads
[55:42] amen but so he says listen it was an
[55:45] unveiling or an uncovering is what he
[55:48] called
[55:49] it
[55:51] Paul he said that when he preached the
[55:54] gospel that Christ made known what is
[55:56] his secret and so forth he says having
[55:59] made known unto
[56:01] us the mystery of his will according to
[56:04] the good pleasure which he purp in
[56:07] himself
[56:08] amen even predestination according as he
[56:12] has chosen Us in him from the foundation
[56:14] of the world he begin to uncover the
[56:16] whole plan of God for thousands of years
[56:18] people didn't understand what the whole
[56:20] plan of God was but now it's made known
[56:23] how many knows even the seals
[56:26] Jesus Saidi have yet many things to say
[56:29] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[56:32] how be it when the spirit of Truth is
[56:34] come he will lead you and guide you
[56:37] into see so there's always a further a
[56:41] more uh a truth coming out
[56:45] amen praise be to
[56:48] God
[56:50] Amen brother brah says the importance of
[56:53] Revelation by the spirit to the True
[56:54] Believer can never be
[56:59] overemphasized that's right it means
[57:02] more to you than perhaps you realize not
[57:04] just the Book of Revelation but I'm
[57:06] talking about all Revelation it's very
[57:10] tremendously important to the
[57:13] church how many believe that if
[57:16] Revelation be on you look up and seek
[57:18] God for it
[57:20] amen that's the only way that you're
[57:22] ever going to get it a revelation has to
[57:24] come from God it never comes by human
[57:27] natural endowments but by spiritual end
[57:29] demment he says and you can't you can
[57:31] even memorize the scripture and though
[57:33] it is wonderful that won't do it it has
[57:37] to be a revelation of God
[57:40] Amen and the Bible says that no man can
[57:43] called Jesus to Christ but by the Holy
[57:45] Ghost amen and when you receive the Holy
[57:47] Ghost then and only then can that Spirit
[57:49] give you that Revelation that Jesus is
[57:53] the Christ and he says we need to call
[57:55] on God for Revelation more than anything
[57:58] else in the
[58:01] world
[58:03] wo more than anything else in the world
[58:06] young people you need to ask God for
[58:09] Revelation in other words make these
[58:11] things known to you amen sister Sher she
[58:15] needs a revelation or has it that hey
[58:18] I'm Healed God has healed me God has to
[58:21] personally Quicken that to
[58:23] you anybody that's sick no matter what
[58:26] it is if you're a sinner and you want to
[58:28] get filled with the Holy Ghost you pray
[58:30] God give me a revelation sometimes we
[58:32] call it a Pentecostal experience
[58:35] sometimes we call it a personal
[58:36] experience because it does have to be a
[58:39] personal
[58:40] experience and God doesn't have any
[58:44] grandchildren your parents ever so good
[58:47] and every all that they teach you and
[58:48] that's wonderful and good and you ought
[58:50] to obey him and listen to it but you
[58:52] pray young people you pray for
[58:54] Revelation see God out I want you to
[58:56] reveal yourself to me cuz in the
[59:00] beginning God created the heavens and
[59:03] the Earth and he said let there be light
[59:05] and there was light brother B
[59:08] says listen to
[59:10] this he says uh he says the only light
[59:14] that we can live by today in the church
[59:17] is God vindicating the light to this
[59:19] generation he says there was growth
[59:22] Darkness upon the Earth fog and Mist
[59:24] upon the Earth and God said let there be
[59:26] light now what if that light would not
[59:29] have come brother Place one place he
[59:31] says that was not even light when he
[59:33] said it until it was
[59:36] manifested and that's the way it is with
[59:39] you and I old young whoever we are amen
[59:41] it's never a reality to you until it's
[59:44] made manifest and that's what we pray
[59:48] for God make yourself real to
[59:53] me I don't want it to be on the pages I
[59:56] want it to be right here I want my
[59:58] healing I want my salvation I want my
[1:00:00] Victorious life I want the baptism I
[1:00:02] want it all to be a revelation God
[1:00:05] personally revealed it to me brother
[1:00:07] Brad a couple weeks ago talking about
[1:00:09] man you know we we get the new birth we
[1:00:11] think that's it no there's still 600

[1:00:17] more reveal all of your promises to me
[1:00:26] you think your
[1:00:27] natural knowledge of the word is going
[1:00:30] to overcome the
[1:00:33] devil no just your natural understanding
[1:00:37] isn't going to do
[1:00:39] it that's why you pray young people you
[1:00:42] pray God make yourself real to me let me
[1:00:45] get on my prayer bones and say God make
[1:00:48] yourself real and then if he fills you
[1:00:49] with the Holy Ghost and you believe that
[1:00:50] you're born again well then don't stop
[1:00:53] there amen keep praying say God reveal
[1:00:57] yourself more to we need me we need
[1:00:59] Revelation every day just that little
[1:01:02] revelation of what God gave me for this
[1:01:04] morning I mean that was just yielding to
[1:01:07] God and saying God reveal yourself more
[1:01:09] and he'll take that little bit and oh
[1:01:11] he'll just set you on fire with it anden
[1:01:15] it doesn't have to be a great thing quit
[1:01:16] looking for such big things young people
[1:01:19] listen to that still Small Voice that
[1:01:21] talks to you it'll tell
[1:01:24] you so I'm I want to encourage young
[1:01:26] people listen to that still Small Voice
[1:01:29] us older Po Folks be good off too to
[1:01:31] listen to that voice ain't that right
[1:01:33] listen to that still he'll Quicken it to
[1:01:35] you ask and you shall receive seek and
[1:01:38] you shall find so when you ask be
[1:01:41] expecting
[1:01:43] something because it's coming he keeps
[1:01:47] his
[1:01:50] word knowing Jesus died for you that's
[1:01:54] wonderful but that has to be a personal
[1:01:56] revelation to you
[1:01:59] amen pray for revelation we need to call
[1:02:02] on oh my listen than anything else in
[1:02:05] the
[1:02:06] world we have accepted the B the great
[1:02:09] Bible the truth of it we have accepted
[1:02:11] the grace truth of it but still it's not
[1:02:14] real to most people because the
[1:02:16] revelation of by the spirit isn't
[1:02:23] there now I don't really like it when
[1:02:25] preaching just come up here and say no
[1:02:27] you know you say say I believe it I
[1:02:28] accept it into my heart that don't do
[1:02:30] you one bit of good but yet brother bam
[1:02:33] says if that's all you can do that's
[1:02:34] what you do because guess what before a
[1:02:37] seed can Sprout you've got to take it
[1:02:39] into your heart if the word says it you
[1:02:41] say I believe that I accept that if it's
[1:02:44] just mental take it that way take it
[1:02:46] that way until God makes it Quicken to
[1:02:48] you because one thing sure you ain't
[1:02:50] getting it if you're not accepting
[1:02:52] it
[1:02:53] amen no you'll never get it if you don't
[1:02:56] well I don't know if it's for me or I'm
[1:02:58] just going to wait till God reveals it
[1:02:59] yeah you're going to wait till God
[1:03:00] reveals it but in the meantime believe
[1:03:02] it with all of your
[1:03:05] heart amen can't be
[1:03:08] overemphasized us parents how many of us
[1:03:11] parents would say I want my children to
[1:03:14] have a personal experience with God
[1:03:17] that's saying I want my children to have
[1:03:19] a personal revelation I want God to
[1:03:23] personally reveal himself to your my
[1:03:27] children cuz no matter how much you say
[1:03:30] no how much you've taught them it's all
[1:03:32] in
[1:03:33] vain if they end up going down the wrong
[1:03:36] road and if they don't get a personal
[1:03:38] revelation sooner or later it's all
[1:03:40] going to be in vain because there's no
[1:03:42] anchor there the anchor of your life is
[1:03:46] that personal and the reason I wanted to
[1:03:48] focus on children more is because it
[1:03:50] doesn't matter if it's Paul it doesn't
[1:03:52] matter if it's Moses every person that
[1:03:55] had a personal revelation they were
[1:03:57] children in the eyes of
[1:04:00] God they were just children it's just
[1:04:03] the start of God revealing himself to
[1:04:06] them how many knows when Moses he ran he
[1:04:08] was a coward and everything else and he
[1:04:11] tried to do it himself and it didn't
[1:04:12] work but when God talked to him on the
[1:04:15] back side of the desert he was not
[1:04:17] afraid to go into Egypt and if you want
[1:04:19] to kill those great big giants that
[1:04:21] you're going to face in your life and
[1:04:23] you have have H 10 times 100 more times
[1:04:26] the Temptation the trials and the tests
[1:04:28] that we had when we were growing up
[1:04:30] ain't that right our kids face great
[1:04:34] opposition and anything outside of a
[1:04:36] real personal experience isn't going to
[1:04:42] do I was listening to brother bam he
[1:04:44] said you know that black brother moose I
[1:04:46] believe his name was down in the South
[1:04:49] amen he got the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:52] Ghost and his boss said you know Moos I
[1:04:54] I need some of that I want I want to get
[1:04:56] the Holy Ghost sometime you know when I
[1:04:57] get a time and I'll I'll call you and
[1:04:59] I'll let you know so one day he called
[1:05:01] Moses I want to get this Holy Ghost he
[1:05:03] says here's a corn crib the Corn's all
[1:05:05] God good nice warm dry Place let's go to
[1:05:07] Corn Crib most said nope that's not how
[1:05:09] you going to get it okay well let's go
[1:05:11] up here to the hay Mound and we're going
[1:05:13] to get up in the hay Mound oh it's just
[1:05:15] really nice here you know we can just
[1:05:17] lay back on our backs and pray and say
[1:05:19] thank you Lord fill me with the Holy
[1:05:21] Ghost M said nope can't get it that way
[1:05:24] don't come that way' and they went down
[1:05:26] around to Pig pin he said there was
[1:05:30] Waller I guess about
[1:05:32] need most waited up in there waited up
[1:05:36] in there slashing around come on in
[1:05:40] here he says well I don't want that he
[1:05:43] says I didn't think you want it in first
[1:05:48] place huh how many know you got to go
[1:05:51] you got to be willing to die to yourself
[1:05:53] amen you got to make that choice I want
[1:05:55] to serve God that's one of the most
[1:05:57] important things that you got to do when
[1:05:59] you get a little bit older you got to
[1:06:01] decide what you want to do you decide
[1:06:04] who you want to serve is it going to be
[1:06:06] the god or the devil because you're
[1:06:07] going to serve somebody and you're going
[1:06:09] to go down a road that's either a hell
[1:06:11] Road or it's a Heavenly Road and you got
[1:06:13] to make that
[1:06:15] choice amen and you lay aside everything
[1:06:17] else and say God I tell you what now
[1:06:20] right now Lord Mom and Daddy's going to
[1:06:21] find me dead laying here until you fill
[1:06:23] me with the Holy Ghost you got to get
[1:06:25] real serious about it when you get real
[1:06:27] serious about it you watch God come and
[1:06:29] change your
[1:06:35] life in 1906 I think one of the leaders
[1:06:38] of the Pentecostal
[1:06:41] movement he said you know the people
[1:06:43] would come up and they would want to
[1:06:44] know whether they got the Holy Ghost he
[1:06:47] says if you got a question whether the
[1:06:48] Holy Ghost then you ain't got it I
[1:06:50] thought it was pretty good no you ain't
[1:06:52] got it if you have to question whether
[1:06:54] you got it you're going to know that
[1:06:56] just something happened you're going to
[1:06:58] know that you have been
[1:07:00] changed you know that those sins have
[1:07:03] been forgiven you're not the same man
[1:07:04] not the same woman that you was before
[1:07:06] not the same boy not the same girl it
[1:07:08] don't matter if you're young if you're
[1:07:10] old you have got to have that personal
[1:07:13] experience with almighty God cuz it's
[1:07:16] the only rock that your soul will ever
[1:07:18] anchor on there'll be Hypocrites in the
[1:07:21] church there'll be Hypocrites in your
[1:07:22] neighborhood Mom and Dad could be a
[1:07:24] hypocrite this my might be a hypocrite
[1:07:26] but none of that self will shake you if
[1:07:28] you have a real experience with
[1:07:32] God hello your preacher could fall let's
[1:07:35] just get personal here but if that would
[1:07:38] happen if you're a personal revelation
[1:07:40] to God that won't shake you either why
[1:07:43] because your experience isn't known
[1:07:44] whether a pastor stays right amen or a
[1:07:47] preacher or your mom or your daddy or
[1:07:48] your grandma or Grandpa amen that's not
[1:07:51] got nothing to do with you
[1:07:56] amen one amen
[1:07:58] anyway isn't that right you got to have
[1:08:00] a personal experience why you think I'm
[1:08:02] standing here folks I don't go by nobody
[1:08:05] else in their experience or what what
[1:08:06] people do or don't do got nothing to do
[1:08:09] with
[1:08:11] it you love the Lord
[1:08:14] tonight that's right amen back to the
[1:08:17] light you see in Ephesians the next
[1:08:21] verse he says you know he says the eyes
[1:08:23] of your understanding
[1:08:26] being
[1:08:27] enlightened wo isn't that right the eyes
[1:08:30] of your understanding being enlightened
[1:08:33] that's what opens up I think it was
[1:08:36] Jesus if I'm not wrong he said it this
[1:08:39] way he says blessed are your eyes for
[1:08:42] they see and blessed are your ears for
[1:08:45] they hear why because those folks they
[1:08:47] can't hear nothing because they're in
[1:08:49] darkness it takes God to open up the
[1:08:52] eyes of your heart the eyes of your
[1:08:58] understanding
[1:09:00] amen because their hearts and their
[1:09:03] ears and their eyes have they closed
[1:09:07] amen because if your eyes ever come open
[1:09:09] to it I believe it with all my
[1:09:12] heart believe it with all my heart and
[1:09:15] God opens it up and baptize it with the
[1:09:18] Holy Ghost then you can truly
[1:09:21] say I once was blind but now I see all
[1:09:26] the preacher talks about peace that
[1:09:29] passes understanding oh I wonder what
[1:09:32] that's really
[1:09:34] like joy
[1:09:36] unspeakable and full of Glory oh I
[1:09:39] wonder what that's really like but you
[1:09:42] get the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost you get your mind and heart set on
[1:09:50] him how old are you now Paul 15
[1:09:55] see I was only five years older than
[1:09:57] you five years older than you when God
[1:10:01] did a work in my life I said God here's
[1:10:03] my life take it and use it for whatever
[1:10:06] you
[1:10:10] want here I stand why because God came
[1:10:16] down and he did
[1:10:18] something give me a personal revelation
[1:10:22] of
[1:10:24] himself by coming and accepting my
[1:10:28] repentance
[1:10:30] amen this morning you seen him up there
[1:10:32] getting baptized and most of them in
[1:10:35] shorts
[1:10:37] huh one man was over there praying for
[1:10:40] somebody else I think and I was kind of
[1:10:42] feeling bad the man was shirtless in my
[1:10:45] church I said I didn't catch
[1:10:48] that but shirtless up there and I'm like
[1:10:52] nah no I just can't see God accepting
[1:10:55] all
[1:10:57] that huh let them go in with tattoos
[1:11:00] Living For The Devil and let them go to
[1:11:02] heaven and make you live straight
[1:11:05] life make you watch every thought that
[1:11:08] go through your mind bring it all into
[1:11:09] captivity while they can I don't think
[1:11:11] it's G to be like that do you no without
[1:11:14] Holiness no man shall see God you come
[1:11:17] God's way or you don't come and they're
[1:11:20] going to knock and knock and knock and
[1:11:21] try to get in and weary themselves well
[1:11:24] I went and I got baptized but it didn't
[1:11:26] work so I'll go back to my devil worship
[1:11:28] like I was here yesterday huh weary
[1:11:32] themselves to find the
[1:11:35] door but be glad young people that
[1:11:37] you've been you've been given the light
[1:11:40] amen you're not in darkness we're not in
[1:11:42] darkness what is that light when
[1:11:44] something's made real I'll send you
[1:11:46] Elijah to Prophet before the great and
[1:11:48] Dreadful day of the Lord when he comes
[1:11:49] and opens up amen and says if I haven't
[1:11:52] told you the truth amen don't believe me
[1:11:54] but if I do and Jesus comes and
[1:11:56] vindicates it it'll be sin for you to
[1:11:58] disbelieve how many knows the light that
[1:12:01] has come was Jesus Christ coming and
[1:12:04] even having his picture taken the pillar
[1:12:06] of fire so you don't have to be in that
[1:12:10] oo I'm Methodist I'm Baptist I'm
[1:12:13] Pentecostal which one's going to be
[1:12:15] right who's going to make it great big
[1:12:18] Steeples and churches and
[1:12:21] oo the days of Miracles is passed you

[1:12:29] sadness you don't have to be in sorrow
[1:12:32] you don't have to be scared you don't
[1:12:34] have to wonder you don't have to qu you
[1:12:36] can know because the light is really
[1:12:40] bright amen arise and shine for thy
[1:12:43] light is come the eyes of your
[1:12:46] understanding has
[1:12:47] opened folks I would still be wondering
[1:12:50] which Pentecostal church I would belong
[1:12:52] in
[1:12:56] I watched uh the Pentecostals reunion
[1:12:59] the other
[1:13:00] day the preacher was up there I guess he
[1:13:02] was the overseer of it all and he had 14
[1:13:05] preachers to come up and they were
[1:13:06] reading their articles of Faith 14
[1:13:09] articles of faith I believe it was and
[1:13:11] one was you know we believe in the
[1:13:13] resurrection and we believe in uh the
[1:13:16] saving of the Soul we believe in all
[1:13:18] kinds I'm well that's all scripture come
[1:13:20] on down the other preacher said we
[1:13:21] believe in baptism in the name of the
[1:13:24] father son and of the Holy Ghost the
[1:13:26] other preacher said well why we believe
[1:13:28] that the speaking in tongues is the
[1:13:30] initial it's the evidence of the Holy
[1:13:32] Ghost brother brandham talked about them
[1:13:34] guys amen why do they do that where does
[1:13:38] the bible say that you're supposed to
[1:13:39] have those type of Articles nowhere so
[1:13:42] they're unscriptural all their articles
[1:13:44] are
[1:13:46] unscriptural repent all of you for doing
[1:13:49] unscriptural stuff just believe the
[1:13:51] whole
[1:13:53] Bible go up there and say well guess
[1:13:56] what why wasn't anybody ever baptized in
[1:13:58] the titles of the father son the holy
[1:14:00] ghost in the Bible not one
[1:14:03] person but would do you think that would
[1:14:05] open their ears do you think that will
[1:14:07] open their eyes no they're so stuck and
[1:14:09] he was talking about yeah I know that
[1:14:11] bad stuff has coming Among Us yeah I
[1:14:14] know people say that we're backslid but
[1:14:16] I'm not worried about us not making it
[1:14:18] because we've got 14 articles of Faith
[1:14:20] amen and this next convention we're
[1:14:22] going to confirm that thing again and
[1:14:24] this that and the other
[1:14:28] amen I thought wow that's where they
[1:14:31] have went to that's where they are still
[1:14:33] suck in the same place they were way
[1:14:34] back then when the truth is presented
[1:14:37] their eyes don't come open
[1:14:40] amen Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I
[1:14:44] want to see you I want to see you
[1:14:48] blessed are your
[1:14:50] eyes for they
[1:14:53] see can you say this this
[1:14:56] evening the Holy Spirit what is the holy
[1:14:59] spirit I see what the holy spirit is I
[1:15:03] see what the Holy Spirit does because
[1:15:06] he's doing it in my
[1:15:10] heart brandom and Paul said no man call
[1:15:13] can call Jesus the Christ but by the
[1:15:15] Holy Ghost you don't know him until you
[1:15:18] have it your heart you just
[1:15:21] intellectually know him but it takes
[1:15:25] diving into the pool to get wet takes
[1:15:28] diving into the water to feel the
[1:15:30] temperature of it otherwise you're just
[1:15:32] saying that's
[1:15:34] water
[1:15:36] hello praise the Lord God is good isn't
[1:15:42] he but the light came in Paul's day the
[1:15:46] True Light Came ain't that right the
[1:15:49] Bible says the true light has come and
[1:15:51] it's shining into the hearts of people
[1:15:53] but then guess what happened we went
[1:15:55] down into some more Dark Ages didn't we
[1:15:58] Dark Ages until Martin Luther had to
[1:16:00] fight for every inch of ground that he
[1:16:02] got had to stand before that Pope and
[1:16:05] say I can't reject those articles I
[1:16:07] can't reject what we believe the just
[1:16:11] shall live by faith I can't in good
[1:16:13] consant to it the light was starting to
[1:16:16] come out ain't that right starting to be
[1:16:18] born again coming back forth and all the
[1:16:21] Palmer worm all the caterpillar all that
[1:16:23] those Dark Ages amen and all those worms
[1:16:25] that ate away from the truth all of a
[1:16:27] sudden it comes back to light more light
[1:16:30] comes Pentecostals
[1:16:32] come but then what happened the very
[1:16:35] life of Jesus Christ came and manifested
[1:16:38] himself in a man so much that people and
[1:16:41] thousands of people thought well he's
[1:16:46] Jesus you might be critical but whence
[1:16:49] the last time said man you you do so
[1:16:51] many of the works of Jesus you discern
[1:16:53] the thoughts and the sents of the heart
[1:16:54] you do everything raised and dead are
[1:16:57] you
[1:16:59] Jesus I don't think any of us had that
[1:17:02] problem people say they want to be like
[1:17:04] Jesus I want to be like Jesus that was
[1:17:06] the closest man I've ever known to be
[1:17:08] more just so close to Jesus until people
[1:17:10] mistook him for
[1:17:12] Jesus he was so yielded he was just my
[1:17:15] brother but he was so yielded to the
[1:17:17] holy spirit that he could do the very
[1:17:19] same works that he did when he walked
[1:17:21] the shores of Galilee and a lot more
[1:17:25] isn't that
[1:17:29] right
[1:17:31] amen then people have a problem when you

[1:18:15] Christ
[1:18:19] amen that's exactly right I ain't got to
[1:18:21] worry about brother Bram not following
[1:18:22] Christ he followed Christ
[1:18:26] God trusted him so much he came to such
[1:18:28] maturity on a spiritual level that God
[1:18:31] could trust him a't that right that
[1:18:35] young couple's misbehaving on the front
[1:18:37] row kissing each other and all over each
[1:18:40] other and terrible lwd and everything
[1:18:42] else and tells him to stop that now
[1:18:44] you're in the house of God go get you a
[1:18:46] room or something go get out of here

[1:19:39] prophet
[1:19:41] was so close to Christ so close to God
[1:19:44] that he can trust me with the spoken
[1:19:46] word and not speak them out of
[1:19:51] existence not judge them and cond
