[0:00] no matter what you're doing whether
[0:01] you're going to a boxing match or
[0:04] whether you're running a race and when
[0:06] you do all that
[0:07] those people those type of people that
[0:09] do that they have to
[0:11] prepare to eat the right food they have
[0:14] to do the right exercises
[0:16] in that right then they have to drink
[0:18] the right drinks they have to do
[0:20] everything just right
[0:21] amen to get ready for what they are
[0:23] doing amen
[0:25] i believe that's the way it is with the
[0:26] bride of jesus christ
[0:28] if we're going to be ready for a rapture
[0:30] we're going to have to eat the right
[0:32] thing we're going to have
[0:33] to exercise what we eat and do so forth
[0:36] aiming and all of that and so if you'll
[0:38] notice here that i just wanted to pick
[0:40] this thought up from this
[0:42] is that after paul said all of that
[0:44] about the running and about the being
[0:46] temperate
[0:47] and all of that he talks begins to talk
[0:49] about his
[0:50] body in that right his body he talks
[0:53] about his body
[0:54] and how that he has to bring his body i
[0:57] keep under my body
[0:59] and bring it into subjection amen
[1:03] i believe the prophet of god said one of
[1:04] the signs that you're
[1:06] amen headed for the rapture and and
[1:09] we're heading for the rapture getting
[1:11] ready for the rapture is when your
[1:13] body comes subject to the word of god
[1:16] amen i believe i don't know about you
[1:18] but i certainly feel a pull
[1:20] in my heart just as the let me just say
[1:23] this way hell
[1:24] is pulling the evil people towards it
[1:27] rapidly
[1:28] and they're right they're heading
[1:30] towards hell really really fast it's
[1:33] pulling them i mean just in the last
[1:36] five
[1:36] six years we've seen our nation endorse
[1:39] homosexuality by the supreme court
[1:41] you know and then going into uh you know
[1:44] letting our kids decide what gender they
[1:46] want to be it's just
[1:47] really fast it's just no end how low
[1:50] will they do and so forth
[1:51] but they're heading that way but if
[1:53] we're the bride of jesus christ we're
[1:55] going to be
[1:56] pulled in another direction amen and i
[1:59] trust that everybody here and i know
[2:01] that you do because of the response that
[2:04] that i get from amen the word of god
[2:07] amen and
[2:08] us pulling towards the word we're being
[2:11] pulled towards the word amen
[2:13] and that's what we want to talk about
[2:14] tonight being pulled towards the word
[2:16] and of course i've preached on this many
[2:18] times but
[2:19] you just bear with me amen because we
[2:21] first of all we want to talk about our
[2:22] greatest enemy now
[2:24] let's start with this and see if i can
[2:26] turn this on i can
[2:29] do i need to push this button right here
[2:30] that turns it on
[2:33] are you going to pull it up for me all
[2:35] right i call it the real enemy amen
[2:38] the real enemy amen
[2:41] amen our our greatest enemy i mean we
[2:43] already know what it is right
[2:46] we know what the greatest enemy is i
[2:48] love to talk about this you know
[2:50] uh i'm glad i'm not ambushing many night
[2:53] or baptist folks because this
[2:55] this here is way deeper than all of that
[2:58] how many knows
[2:58] we're in a way deeper than a baptist or
[3:01] a pentecostal that
[3:02] just thinks that if you speak in tongues
[3:04] up here at the altar
[3:05] that you got holy ghost you're saved
[3:08] how many knows that's not very deep at
[3:10] all amen we know that
[3:12] they'll go out there lie cheat and steal
[3:14] and everything else we know that isn't
[3:15] it amen
[3:16] it's much deeper than that and then to
[3:18] find out who our real enemy is and where
[3:21] the real battle is where the real
[3:24] war is amen let me see if i can go on
[3:27] with this
[3:28] to the next one all right
[3:32] well i gotta turn it on first i'm like
[3:34] hey you know what that might just help
[3:36] all right here we go are you all ready
[3:39] all right i push it a little longer
[3:40] maybe
[3:41] there we are all right
[3:44] now that's not okay that's the last one
[3:48] i push that up to the last one let me go
[3:50] backwards
[3:55] huh hold on i'm certainly not looking
[3:58] for that one
[3:59] why does it keep backing all right
[4:06] all right
[4:10] go back one uh this one here
[4:17] all right yeah this will be fine we'll
[4:18] go with this now we are
[4:20] dealing when we're talking about the
[4:21] devil all right how many knows that
[4:24] uh the devil isn't your real enemy
[4:28] because he said now we're dealing with a
[4:30] defeated enemy
[4:32] sickness is defeated all right sickness
[4:35] is defeated
[4:36] death is defeated hell is defeated
[4:39] everything is defeated
[4:41] oh i'm my i wish i had twice my size
[4:44] or maybe i'd feel twice as good he said
[4:47] brother beats on the pulpit
[4:48] we are disputing with a conquered
[4:52] enemy no wonder paul could say
[4:55] when there was in the building block to
[4:56] chop his head off
[4:58] he said oh death where is your sting
[5:02] show me where you can make me squirm and
[5:04] scream
[5:05] grave where is your victory and you
[5:07] think you'll mold me out there i'll
[5:10] point you to an empty one over here and
[5:12] i'm in him and he'll raise me up in the
[5:15] last days
[5:16] a defeated enemy
[5:19] amen so the devil's not your enemy
[5:22] anymore he's completely defeated
[5:27] he's powerless he's stripped of every
[5:29] rights that he has
[5:30] isn't he how many sled for that
[5:33] praise be to god all right so let's go
[5:37] to the next one
[5:39] and as far as christ he can't do nothing
[5:41] for you either
[5:45] all right that's good that's exactly
[5:47] right now notice
[5:49] god's provision for divine healing
[5:53] was on the basis of faith and that's the
[5:55] same way he heals them tonight
[5:57] is on the basis of faith know how matter
[6:00] how great
[6:01] man if christ himself was standing here
[6:05] on the pulpit with this suit on
[6:07] that he gave me if he was standing here
[6:10] in this suit
[6:11] he could not heal you wow
[6:15] not at all
[6:18] he has already done it now he might do
[6:21] something to convince you
[6:23] now how many knows that happened in
[6:24] brother branham's ministry
[6:26] what built people's faith what made him
[6:30] actually be able to believe
[6:31] was the discernment and so forth and it
[6:34] built their faith because
[6:35] we all know that there was a lot of
[6:37] people did not get their healing
[6:39] that was sick out there that needed it
[6:42] people come through the line and get
[6:43] paid for it they didn't get it it all
[6:45] depends on their faith christ couldn't
[6:49] do
[6:49] anything more for you we went and
[6:52] preached the whole message here a couple
[6:53] months ago
[6:54] ago on how that he says how on this very
[6:57] subject before
[6:58] christ can't do anything more for you
[7:01] you have
[7:02] to accept what he's already done
[7:07] because what he said on calvary he said
[7:09] it is finished
[7:11] the work was done it was finished
[7:14] his part is done
[7:18] even if he was standing in there he says
[7:20] he couldn't do a bit for me
[7:22] so now we know that the devil amen he
[7:25] absolutely is powerless now how many
[7:27] knows that
[7:28] the only power that the devil has is in
[7:31] people
[7:32] that give him power
[7:35] all right and listen the devil can't
[7:38] even bother
[7:39] you unless you let him
[7:45] he can't use you unless you let him
[7:49] he can't get to you unless you let him
[7:53] how he believes that when i got to
[7:55] thinking about this and i said most of
[7:57] the time
[7:58] that the way that the devil will try to
[8:00] get to you is through
[8:02] somebody else now how many of those
[8:04] human beings are boy
[8:06] they're complicated to deal with and you
[8:09] got to watch human beings you gotta
[8:11] watch their
[8:12] influence you gotta watch what they do
[8:14] you gotta watch what they say about you
[8:17] because that's most of the time how the
[8:19] devil will try to get to you
[8:22] is through other people that is uh that
[8:24] he's controlling
[8:27] but only if you let him that's why near
[8:30] circumstance why
[8:31] amen your greatest enemy is never
[8:33] anybody else
[8:36] huh your greatest enemy is of whether or
[8:39] not
[8:39] you are going to allow the devil to
[8:41] bother you or not
[8:44] whether you will let him get to you or
[8:46] not
[8:47] and it takes a holy ghost it takes
[8:49] somebody that's real consecrated to god
[8:51] because every one of us walked this
[8:53] journey and we've been hurt by people
[8:55] i've heard probably people heard some of
[8:56] y'all i had to get over it
[9:00] i had to repent hello it's all part of
[9:02] it isn't it right we human beings we're
[9:03] full of mistakes
[9:05] but there's one thing for sure your your
[9:08] your
[9:09] experience can't be based on what
[9:11] somebody else does
[9:13] or whether whether a preacher falls or
[9:15] whether a preacher's dead that can't be
[9:16] what's based on
[9:18] or you'll never stand is that all right
[9:22] so we find that every blessing every
[9:25] blessing in the bible
[9:26] every promise in the book is yours
[9:31] it's already paid for but god can't do
[9:34] anything more for you what does this put
[9:36] it back on
[9:37] it puts it back on your lap and back on
[9:40] my lap
[9:44] both with the devil and with god it's on
[9:48] your lap
[9:50] he can't get to you he's got to get
[9:52] saved just like you got saved if he's
[9:54] ever going to come in where you are
[9:57] unless you go out
[10:01] you have to go out amen and that's
[10:04] all part of this flesh getting in the
[10:07] way
[10:08] amen praise the lord now let me see if i
[10:11] can go the right direction i'm not sure
[10:13] all right i'm flipping it
[10:17] right we're not getting the best of
[10:20] signal
[10:21] green we're good there how's that now
[10:26] all right micah what happened
[10:30] you're going to help me out flipping it
[10:31] up for me all right
[10:33] maybe we'll work that way that's all
[10:34] right we'll work together
[10:36] i used to preach over at the baptist
[10:38] church a little sermon and she said it
[10:39] was called let loose and let god that's
[10:41] right
[10:42] just let loose and let god
[10:45] but as long as you got yourself into it
[10:49] there ain't no way
[10:51] then he says you know what the biggest
[10:52] enemy i got the biggest enemy of god is
[10:55] william branham
[10:56] he's always in god's way if you can just
[10:59] get him out of the way
[11:01] then god can go to work that's
[11:04] your worst enemy
[11:07] is yourself
[11:13] just get yourself out of the way and
[11:16] then god
[11:17] can go to work
[11:21] amen praise the lord listen to what he
[11:24] says here
[11:24] now be careful of your associates when
[11:26] you get out there and get among people
[11:28] and this one begins to tell you this
[11:30] and this one that then you get yourself
[11:32] all mixed up
[11:33] you don't know what you believe not
[11:35] about the truth i mean
[11:36] you gotta watch who you listen to what
[11:39] you listen to
[11:40] could get messed up oh man confused real
[11:44] quick
[11:47] but so there he says that you are your
[11:50] worst enemy not god
[11:54] amen he can't do any more except for
[11:56] what you accept
[11:58] not the devil the devil himself he's
[12:00] already been stripped of his power
[12:03] huh now it comes down into
[12:06] our laps
[12:15] i like this phrase right here he says if
[12:18] you can just get yourself
[12:21] out of the way now that's the big
[12:23] question right there
[12:24] that's the really big question how much
[12:28] are we still in the way
[12:36] how much are we still in the way because
[12:39] i believe that
[12:40] when i look at when i look at promises
[12:43] like
[12:44] where jesus said in saint john the 14th
[12:46] chapter of love he said
[12:48] let me just read it
[12:53] he says listen verily verily i say unto
[12:55] you he that believeth on me the works
[12:56] that i do shall he do also
[12:58] and greater works than thee shall ye do
[13:00] because i go unto the father
[13:02] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[13:05] that will i do
[13:11] isn't that a great promise that
[13:14] whatsoever you would ask
[13:15] that he would do
[13:19] amen to be in that place
[13:24] now i ask you i ask everybody in here
[13:26] that question
[13:28] do you feel like you're in the place
[13:29] that that's something that you can say
[13:31] yeah i've
[13:31] i've proven that it's true huh
[13:37] first of all you want to be careful what
[13:38] you ask for right
[13:40] because if you ask and miss you ain't
[13:41] going to get it but if you can be so
[13:44] yielded to god so
[13:45] let by god it should be that when you
[13:47] ask for it
[13:48] god gives it to you
[13:53] see my goal is to become a lot like
[13:55] brother branham
[13:56] [Music]
[13:57] huh brother baby says i can tell you
[13:59] right now
[14:00] he says that i and if anything i've ever
[14:02] asked god for
[14:03] he says he either give it to me or he
[14:05] told me why i wouldn't i couldn't
[14:10] amen i'll tell you if we can get to the
[14:12] place folks get out of our own way
[14:15] so much until we get to the place if we
[14:18] can speak to storms
[14:19] and bulls and hornets will be doing
[14:22] pretty good
[14:23] it may not be storms it may not be bulls
[14:26] it may not be hornets
[14:27] but it'll be something in your life that
[14:29] you need to speak to
[14:33] get to the place where we come in here
[14:35] and say brother also maybe come up here
[14:36] and i got a testimony i'll tell you what
[14:38] i was about to die the other day
[14:39] and i just threw my hands up the love
[14:41] and i just felt the love of god come
[14:42] down he just took care of it
[14:44] all give me a peace and a rest
[14:48] huh see folks
[14:51] we have to think about that just how
[14:53] much of our self
[14:55] is still in the way
[14:58] because i believe that if you ever we
[15:00] get out of the way that we're supposed
[15:02] to
[15:02] every promise in this book is yours and
[15:04] we will see it manifested in a greater
[15:07] way
[15:11] amen i would rather a preacher challenge
[15:14] me than to tell me well it just doesn't
[15:16] happen
[15:17] anymore forget about that it ain't for
[15:19] you
[15:20] and downplay it huh how many knows that
[15:23] even jesus talking about this now where
[15:26] will we get a scripture that talks about
[15:28] our us being the greatest enemy
[15:31] where would we go to see what jesus
[15:33] might say that
[15:34] you are your greatest enemy this is the
[15:37] scripture i come up with
[15:40] in luke 14 and verse 26 26 he says
[15:44] if any man come after me and hate not
[15:46] his father and mother
[15:47] and wife and children and brethren and
[15:49] sisters
[15:51] yay and the last thing he says
[15:54] and his own life also
[15:57] huh in other words yourself you got to
[16:01] hate yourself
[16:02] also amen because how many do this right
[16:06] here this flesh
[16:08] this flesh is your greatest enemy it's
[16:10] the thing that tries to get you to veer
[16:13] off
[16:14] it's so powerful that he would take a
[16:16] prophet of god
[16:17] that he even had to have a cross hanging
[16:19] on his
[16:20] because of all the naked women that were
[16:22] everywhere
[16:23] and that right that even he had to bear
[16:25] that and every time him and so he would
[16:27] look because
[16:28] it's a man's natural tendency isn't that
[16:30] right
[16:31] to go that direction and to look back to
[16:34] the cross and die to yourself
[16:36] and look to the cross isn't that right
[16:37] even he is pulled this flesh is so
[16:39] pulled
[16:40] in paul's way of saying it he says he
[16:43] had such a fighting battle with the
[16:44] flesh until he says
[16:45] i have to die every day i mean believes
[16:50] that's what we got to do we got to die
[16:52] to ourself every day
[16:56] oh my every day we got to die to ourself
[17:01] amen so there he says it our greatest
[17:04] enemy
[17:09] all right now let's go to where the
[17:11] battle is
[17:13] the battle once again is not out there
[17:15] somewhere
[17:17] where's the battle at the greatest
[17:19] battle ever fought two messages that you
[17:21] might want to listen to
[17:22] that'll go along with what we've been
[17:23] preaching about one is the greatest
[17:25] battle ever fought and the other one is
[17:27] uh christ's mystery of god revealed
[17:30] amen so he says listen
[17:36] now notice never started in some
[17:40] mechanical affair
[17:41] the grounds never started there
[17:43] therefore that organization can never
[17:46] never do the work of god because the
[17:47] battlegrounds
[17:49] where you've got to meet your enemy
[17:52] is in the mind
[18:00] we got to get our minds right
[18:03] you've got to make your choice it meets
[18:06] you
[18:08] talking about little sick girl come on
[18:10] down to here
[18:13] he says practically the same thing he
[18:16] says listen
[18:17] where you've got to meet your enemy is
[18:19] in the mind you've got to make your
[18:21] choice it
[18:21] meets you hey i've got that thing double
[18:24] click there don't i
[18:26] ah the little girl right there i want a
[18:28] little girl yeah i've got the same thing
[18:30] boy that's what happens after you get
[18:32] 59.
[18:35] so it's where where's the battle the
[18:37] battle is in
[18:38] the mind why
[18:42] because that's where the word comes in
[18:44] and then he talks about he says you know
[18:45] it's
[18:46] not a mind over matter thing but this
[18:48] mind has to accept
[18:50] things or it rejects things
[18:53] we all know the things that you think
[18:55] about affect you
[18:56] it makes you what you are and the
[18:59] great battle is right here and you can
[19:03] see
[19:03] in in let's just think about
[19:07] our mind it's a very precious thing a
[19:10] child
[19:10] it most likely is going to be the kind
[19:13] of
[19:13] man that it was raised up and what it
[19:16] was taught
[19:17] in in teaching in the teaching realm is
[19:19] that right
[19:21] we look at our politics today we look at
[19:23] the signs out there the mothers are
[19:25] holding out there
[19:26] and i don't know what all of this uh uh
[19:30] racist thing that they call it they're
[19:32] trying to teach
[19:34] you know to try to teach racism and they
[19:36] got signs up there don't teach my
[19:38] kid hey the government loves they
[19:41] took what the prayer out of school they
[19:43] took discipline out of school and
[19:45] and they teach this that they know how
[19:47] how important it is
[19:49] to catch those kids minds because that's
[19:52] where it starts
[19:55] amen i mean you don't you take the whip
[19:57] out of
[19:58] out of homes you out of the classroom
[20:00] and then what do you got now
[20:02] people out there destroying everything
[20:05] amen and so our mind how many knows our
[20:07] mind is a precious thing and that's
[20:09] where
[20:10] you have to meet the enemy every doubt
[20:13] either faith or doubt right in there is
[20:16] where you meet the devil
[20:19] and you become the kind of person that
[20:20] you allow the thoughts
[20:22] that come into your mind whether it's
[20:24] the word of god or whether it's not
[20:27] the greatest valor has ever fought and
[20:29] it's like
[20:31] when you think about it but abandon when
[20:32] he preached this greatest battle ever
[20:34] fought
[20:34] i don't know if i can shut this down or
[20:36] not right there
[20:38] i'm going to crank it back up see if it
[20:39] works how about that it works
[20:43] when he preached the greatest battle
[20:45] ever fought he began to go into the
[20:46] solar system and then he went into our
[20:48] body soul and consciousness and all of
[20:50] that
[20:51] and he talked about feelings and
[20:52] emotions and all of these things how did
[20:54] all of the flus have to be cleaned out
[20:56] everything has to be straight
[20:58] you have to bring the word of god coming
[21:00] it has to be the center of it all
[21:01] and keep all of that in line isn't that
[21:04] right
[21:05] because you get one memory out of line
[21:06] you remember what somebody did you
[21:08] remember this you think about that and
[21:11] buddy right there it goes boom it can
[21:13] accept your whole world and that right
[21:15] and it's and i got to thinking about how
[21:17] it's like a helicopter oh my you know to
[21:20] me
[21:20] driving a little airplane maybe it
[21:23] wouldn't be all that hard but driving a
[21:24] helicopter from understand
[21:26] you know there's so many foot pedals
[21:27] there's handles there's so many
[21:28] different things that when you drive one
[21:30] of them you really have to know what
[21:31] you're doing
[21:32] and that's a little like the human body
[21:34] that's like this flesh and this
[21:36] body soul and spirit that we're driving
[21:38] amen you have to you have to really be
[21:40] in harmony you have to have it under
[21:42] control
[21:43] if you're going to drive it right
[21:46] are you with me you know it's like
[21:49] driving a car it's very complex and you
[21:51] have to
[21:51] be careful how you do it but brother
[21:53] bram talked about how to
[21:55] he typed with the mechanics and the
[21:56] dynamics of a car and managed to
[21:58] type that with the church how that you
[22:00] know we can't just have the mechanics
[22:02] but you got to have the dynamics with it
[22:04] amen
[22:05] and it's all complex without the power
[22:08] of the holy ghost
[22:10] ruling your life comes right back down
[22:12] to it
[22:13] having that governor folks i'm telling
[22:16] you what you're going to go off in the
[22:18] ditch
[22:19] because guess what this flesh being our
[22:22] biggest enemy
[22:23] it is the one that wants to veer off
[22:26] this way and veer off that way so
[22:29] quickly
[22:31] amen the apostle paul
[22:34] he said that in his hour that there was
[22:37] people that was very spiritual and he
[22:39] said that they were
[22:40] not working at all anymore is that right
[22:43] they were just going from house to house
[22:45] and they were actually busy body
[22:47] in everybody else's matters and see they
[22:50] went extreme so
[22:52] they become so spiritual they were no
[22:54] earthly good
[22:56] you know i don't know about you but i i
[22:58] pity their wives don't you
[23:01] where the next meals come from and
[23:03] everything else their poor wives had to
[23:04] put up with not being supplied for and
[23:06] that was horrible
[23:08] and paul said man if you don't work
[23:10] neither should you eat
[23:11] guess what you're going to go without
[23:13] supper and breakfast if you don't eat
[23:15] well he was trying to tell him to keep
[23:16] the balance in our generation people
[23:18] were so spiritual
[23:19] they sold everything and went out where
[23:21] to move to arizona where brother
[23:22] brother branham was and half of them was
[23:24] on charity and he had to get on
[23:26] questions and answers and give them good
[23:28] old
[23:28] protoplasmic stimulation some correction
[23:32] isn't that right because they were going
[23:33] too far you know
[23:35] so spiritual they don't take care of the
[23:37] natural things
[23:38] amen so you have to keep that balance
[23:40] amen
[23:41] keep the balance of things paul he had
[23:43] the problem with that amen
[23:45] even in our day amen
[23:48] so look you love the lord amen
[23:52] got to keep the balance and this flesh
[23:54] this flesh it's got a
[23:55] it's like a car with a pulling problem
[23:59] i don't know about you but i hate a car
[24:01] or a truck that has a pulling problem
[24:03] don't you bill john
[24:04] he just wants to pull it over he keeps
[24:06] pulling over here pulling over there
[24:09] i won't never forget before i came up to
[24:11] tennessee long time ago
[24:12] moved to tennessee from florida
[24:17] but i'll tell you what it was a
[24:18] good-looking truck it had pretty pretty
[24:20] good wheels on it pretty good looking
[24:21] truck oh my god
[24:24] my guy said let me take my truck let me
[24:26] take your truck to go get a few parts i
[24:27] said go ahead
[24:28] go get him mateos he went hey
[24:42] but he was serious and that's the way
[24:44] our flesh is friend you got to be good
[24:46] to drive this
[24:48] you better have the holy ghost because
[24:50] buddy it'll take you off in left field
[24:52] quicker and you can
[24:53] think isn't that right and you'll end up
[24:55] in the ditch
[24:56] if you don't have the holy let's ghost a
[24:59] scripture over in uh
[25:02] let's look at what paul had to say about
[25:03] it
[25:07] and i'm not sure
[25:13] i'm going to see if this next quote is
[25:14] what i'm looking for
[25:19] take me to the next one michael
[25:23] all right let's just go with this one
[25:25] you see how many believes that
[25:26] if you would really get things right
[25:29] we'd be a powerful
[25:30] people brother ben says in the greatest
[25:33] battle said if this
[25:34] church right now could be put together
[25:37] and knitted together with such
[25:39] that every person would be in one accord
[25:42] with not one shadow of a doubt anywhere
[25:45] there would not be a feeble person in
[25:47] our midst in another five
[25:48] minutes there would not be nobody here
[25:52] desiring the holy ghost
[25:54] but what would receiving if you could
[25:56] just get that
[25:57] certain thing fixed
[26:03] amen get that certain things picked in
[26:06] other words if you could get the thing
[26:08] in the right track
[26:10] you'd never desire the holy ghost
[26:11] because you'd have it
[26:13] you'd be the kind of person the devil
[26:15] doesn't know what to do with you
[26:18] how many desires to be that the devil
[26:20] doesn't know what
[26:21] to do with you because as long as he has
[26:24] an avenue to get to you
[26:26] that's the avenue that he will take
[26:29] that's the avenue that he will take i
[26:32] don't know if i'll think about this or
[26:33] not but i'ma say well i'm thinking about
[26:34] it but you got to realize one thing that
[26:36] brother brahm said he says you know
[26:38] that over in melchizedek when abraham
[26:41] was coming back from the slaughter of
[26:43] the kings he
[26:44] met melchizedek isn't that right
[26:47] and he talked and he had communion and
[26:49] after abraham
[26:51] he says after the battle after the
[26:54] battle
[26:55] abraham had communion with melchizedek
[26:59] and he says talks about that with us and
[27:01] i think i may have it on here
[27:03] i think i do but anyway he says that you
[27:05] know he said
[27:06] after you get yourself
[27:11] y'all remember what he said whipped
[27:14] get yourself whipped then you can have
[27:17] communion with the lord jesus christ
[27:20] but you got to whip yourself because
[27:22] that's your biggest enemy
[27:24] is yourself amen
[27:28] all right not even a feeble person among
[27:31] us go to the next one if you can
[27:32] i don't seem to be going the right way
[27:34] i'll have to we'll have to try this out
[27:35] later on
[27:38] all right black dog white dog scripture
[27:40] i'm looking for
[27:41] somebody told me one time that we
[27:44] somebody was converted received the holy
[27:46] ghost
[27:46] we all know talk about an indian he said
[27:49] to him how are you getting along
[27:51] he said pretty good and pretty bad he
[27:54] said well
[27:54] how do you mean pretty pretty bad and
[27:56] pretty good he said well since he
[27:58] received the holy ghost he said
[28:00] there's been two dogs in me and one of
[28:03] them is a black dog and one of them is a
[28:05] white dog
[28:06] and said they argue all the time
[28:12] isn't that the truth you always got
[28:14] another voice
[28:16] telling you something man you gotta
[28:17] argue back said no get out of here
[28:20] that ain't the thought of god yeah
[28:22] always
[28:23] arguing because your flesh
[28:26] it wants to do one thing when the holy
[28:28] ghost wants to do another
[28:31] oh it's a constant battle all right
[28:35] all right they growl listen they argue
[28:37] all the time
[28:39] they growl and fight at one another and
[28:41] said the white dog wants me to do good
[28:43] the black dog wants me to do bad
[28:46] hello how many knows this is a answer
[28:48] for anybody struggling with anything
[28:51] say well chief which one of them wins
[28:53] the fight said
[28:54] it depends on which the chief feeds the
[28:56] most
[28:58] so i think that's good answer it just
[29:00] depends on the warring of the body
[29:02] that's in you
[29:04] it depends on which one you cater to
[29:08] which nature you cater to the carnal
[29:12] nature after the things of the world or
[29:14] the spiritual nature
[29:16] after thing of god and that does it amen
[29:21] paul let's go to paul romans 8
[29:24] romans 8 verse 14
[29:29] for we know that the law is spiritual
[29:31] but i am carnal
[29:33] sold under sin for that which i do
[29:39] i allow not for that for
[29:42] for what i would that do i not
[29:45] but what i hate that i do amen
[29:50] if then i do that which i would not i
[29:53] can send
[29:54] unto the law that it is good now then it
[29:56] is no more i that do it but sin that
[29:58] dwelleth in me
[30:00] for i know that in me that is in
[30:03] my flesh dwelleth some good things
[30:08] no it says no good thing
[30:12] let me tell you there's only one way
[30:14] that this flesh
[30:16] will ever desire the right things and
[30:18] that's when the nature of it is changed
[30:21] that is the nature of the holy ghost
[30:25] it's not hard to turn your head it's not
[30:27] hard to do right
[30:28] not hard to do any of those things when
[30:31] you've got the right nature in there
[30:33] but if everybody knows that if you tilt
[30:35] that and you
[30:36] not feed on the holy ghost you're not
[30:38] where you ought to be it ain't no
[30:41] time just stop praying for a day or so
[30:43] and find out how quickly you get ill
[30:45] how quickly your temper flares up how
[30:48] quickly you get carnal amen
[30:51] that's right if i know that in me that
[30:53] is in my flesh dwelleth no
[30:55] good things for to will is present with
[30:58] me but how to perform that which is good
[31:00] i find not
[31:01] for the good that i would i do not and
[31:03] the evil which i would not
[31:05] that i do we find ourselves making more
[31:07] mistakes sometimes than we are
[31:09] the good that we know we should do
[31:13] amen what does this mean this means that
[31:15] you are not feeding the white dog enough
[31:19] that's right you're not feeding on god
[31:21] enough
[31:23] because there's no excuses huh
[31:26] it just depends on who you're gonna let
[31:28] let let do it because
[31:30] god voted for you satan voted against
[31:32] you which way are you going to go what
[31:33] are you going to do
[31:36] now if i do that i would not it is no
[31:39] more i that do it but sin that dwelleth
[31:41] in me
[31:41] i find in a law that when i would do
[31:43] good his evil is
[31:45] always present with me
[31:49] oh man i would love to be able to say
[31:51] look there's going to be a come a time
[31:52] when you're going to come to perfection
[31:55] and you'll never make any more mistakes
[31:56] but that's simply not the truth is
[31:59] now you shouldn't do willful sin but
[32:01] we're still going to make mistakes
[32:03] you're going to flub
[32:03] up you're going to lean to the right
[32:05] you're going to get off that center line
[32:07] until the day you die because you're
[32:09] human
[32:12] amen but
[32:15] i do believe that a person can walk with
[32:16] god amen for i delight in the law of the
[32:19] lord after the inward man i like that
[32:21] but i see another law working in my
[32:23] members warning against the law of my
[32:25] mind
[32:26] and bringing me into captivity to the
[32:28] law of sin
[32:29] which is in my member oh wretched man
[32:32] that i am who shall deliver me from the
[32:33] body of this death
[32:35] i thank god that through jesus christ
[32:37] our lord so then with the mind myself i
[32:39] serve the law of god
[32:40] but with the flesh the law of sin
[32:44] amen so the law this the law that the
[32:47] flesh has
[32:48] is the law of sin it always wants to do
[32:52] wrong always pulling it the wrong way
[32:58] day after day and if you don't die daily
[33:01] that thing will rise back up but this is
[33:04] the scripture i really like
[33:06] and that is the next chapter aren't you
[33:09] glad for a chapter eight
[33:11] i'm glad for a chapter eight if there
[33:13] was no chapter eight we'd be all in
[33:15] trouble
[33:16] paul says there is therefore now no
[33:19] condemnation
[33:20] to them which are in christ jesus
[33:24] who walk not after the flesh
[33:30] amen but after
[33:33] the spirit in other words you're always
[33:36] seeking
[33:37] to please the spirit
[33:41] let's go down to the uh verse chapter
[33:44] four
[33:45] verse four now notice that the
[33:47] righteousness of the law might be
[33:49] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[33:51] flesh but after the spirit
[33:53] for they that are after the flesh do
[33:56] mind the things of the flesh
[34:00] isn't that the truth but they that are
[34:02] after the spirit
[34:03] the things of the spirit amen
[34:06] for to be carnally minded is death
[34:10] but to be spiritually minded is life
[34:13] and peace because the carnal mind
[34:16] is enmity against god for it is not
[34:20] subject to the lord of god neither
[34:22] indeed can be
[34:23] so that they that are in the flesh
[34:26] cannot please god
[34:27] boy wow everyone might stop right there
[34:30] step right there and say well i'm in the
[34:32] flesh so i think nobody can ever please
[34:34] god because we're in the flesh
[34:37] no read on but ye
[34:40] are not in the flesh he's not saying
[34:44] that's not where you're living
[34:45] but that's not what you're pleasing
[34:47] that's not what you're serving
[34:48] you're not serving the flesh you're
[34:51] serving the spirit
[34:54] your flesh it doesn't want to get up in
[34:56] the morning
[34:57] how many loves to get up in the morning
[34:58] go to work
[35:03] oh hallelujah i'll tell you what i
[35:05] thought about saying this i thought man
[35:07] if somebody says i love it i said well
[35:09] never mind you know
[35:10] some people just love the work i love
[35:13] that alarm going b
[35:14] b
[35:20] no but you have to make yourself just
[35:22] like your flesh
[35:23] a lot of times doesn't want to go to
[35:25] church doesn't want to pray it doesn't
[35:27] really read a bible
[35:30] don't but get more of the holy ghost in
[35:33] there
[35:34] and you can't wait for the doors to open
[35:36] you can't wait to open the bible you
[35:38] can't wait to listen to another tape
[35:41] amen why because we're not supposed to
[35:44] be
[35:44] in the flesh we're supposed to be in the
[35:47] spirit
[35:48] amen but in the spirit
[35:51] now notice and if so be the spirit of
[35:54] god dwell in you
[35:56] now notice now if any man have not the
[35:58] spirit of christ
[36:00] he is none of his that's where we get to
[36:03] sin
[36:04] unless you're filled with almighty god
[36:05] or unless you're filled with the holy
[36:07] ghost
[36:07] you're not his and if christ be in you
[36:11] the body is dead because of sin
[36:14] but the spirit is life because of
[36:17] righteousness
[36:18] and if the spirit of him that raised up
[36:20] christ from the dead dwell in you
[36:22] he that raised up christ from the dead
[36:23] will also quicken
[36:25] your mortal body
[36:28] amen by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[36:31] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[36:34] the flesh to live
[36:35] after the flesh for if we live after the
[36:38] flesh we
[36:40] shall die but listen to this i like this
[36:44] but if ye through the spirit mortify
[36:48] from what i understand that's cleanse
[36:51] cleanse the deeds of the body
[36:55] he shall live
[36:59] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[37:01] god they are
[37:02] the sons of god amen
[37:06] so i look at that i think about that
[37:09] if we truly would whip ourselves
[37:13] nobody would truly be needing the holy
[37:15] ghost
[37:17] we have victory in our lives someone who
[37:18] believes that if you'd whip yourself
[37:21] completely whip yourself your mind your
[37:23] heart your soul
[37:24] completely to surrender to god see god
[37:27] this is yours
[37:29] i'm your property amen
[37:32] i believe we have peace that passes
[37:34] understanding because it's there for us
[37:36] we have joy unspeakable and full of
[37:39] glory
[37:40] amen there's every promise in here
[37:44] i believe we could move mountains i
[37:47] believe we could ask whatever things we
[37:48] desire
[37:50] and we'd receive them amen
[37:54] i wrote down here i believe that we
[37:56] would be the kind of husbands that we
[37:58] were supposed to be we'd be kind of
[38:00] wives that were supposed to be
[38:02] if you'd really whip yourself you would
[38:04] totally be the kind of neighbor
[38:06] that you'd need to be
[38:09] you'd be the kind of pastor that you
[38:12] need to be
[38:13] you'd have to be the kind of you'd be
[38:14] the kind of sister that you need to be
[38:18] if we would just get out of the way as
[38:20] we see that quote
[38:23] amen get out of the way and let god
[38:26] do just be the kind of friends we could
[38:29] be the kind of bosses
[38:31] that we should be a real christian
[38:35] boss amen
[38:39] we'd be like our prophet
[38:42] because our prophet was like christ
[38:47] amen that's my heart's desire and
[38:50] yours that's how i want to be
[38:55] be like the prophet
[38:58] because he was like christ and
[38:59] ultimately will be like
[39:01] christ like paul said follow me
[39:04] as i follow christ amen
[39:07] you love him tonight so it's on
[39:11] us honey believes it's on us it's on
[39:13] every one of us it's in our lap
[39:16] what will you do he's waiting on you
[39:18] he's waiting for you to believe
[39:20] without a shadow of a doubt if you want
[39:23] if you listen i wrote this on the way
[39:25] sometimes i get things on the way i said
[39:26] honey write this on a piece of paper
[39:28] somewhere if you want to get something
[39:30] from god
[39:31] you have to be like the woman that was
[39:33] called a dog
[39:36] the bible says that he that cometh god
[39:39] that he must
[39:40] he that comes to god must believe that
[39:42] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[39:45] that
[39:47] diligently sometimes god really wants to
[39:50] see how much you mean it
[39:52] am right he wants to see how persevered
[39:55] you are
[39:56] just like he did with that woman he
[39:58] wanted to teach just how desperate how
[40:00] dis
[40:00] you know desperate she was and how
[40:02] perseverant she was
[40:04] and i believe that god's way god and i
[40:05] believe that god knows
[40:08] amen be certain of god you all remember
[40:11] but abraham says he says sometimes it
[40:12] don't seem like god answers like god
[40:14] don't answer like god don't answer
[40:16] but he's just seeing how much you really
[40:18] mean it
[40:19] but he'll come through you can receive
[40:21] it if you truly believe it
[40:24] you set your mind on and say god i won't
[40:26] take no for an answer amen
[40:29] i'm trusting you it's your word it's
[40:31] it's my right amen
[40:33] god bless you let's stand tonight
[40:42] amen musicians if you want to come
[40:53] let's bow our heads
[40:56] i don't know about you brothers and
[40:58] sisters but when i read the word when i
[41:00] look at this
[41:02] i realize how much growing that i still
[41:05] have to do
[41:07] how much room there is for growth in my
[41:10] life
[41:12] how about you would you raise your hands
[41:14] i know there's a lot of growth for me
[41:17] i really need to grow into presence of
[41:20] almighty god and to be more like him and
[41:22] realizing that
[41:23] my biggest enemy everything that the
[41:26] barrier that keeps me from joy
[41:28] the barrier that keeps me from victory
[41:30] the barrier that keeps me from these
[41:32] things is not somewhere out there it's
[41:34] me
[41:34] it's myself it's my unbelief it's my
[41:37] mind it's my heart it's where i'm at
[41:39] it's me
[41:39] i'm gonna have to fight the thing i'm
[41:42] gonna have to get through this barrier
[41:44] of self and trust in god and commit
[41:46] myself to god
[41:47] in such a way until i can see the
[41:49] promises of god coming to pass in my
[41:50] life
[41:51] lord jesus you see the hands all over
[41:53] our hands are up saying god we see
[41:55] where we still need to grow lord well we
[41:58] still need to get closer to you lord and
[42:00] to be more like you father
[42:02] until we see the promises of god being
[42:05] made manifest in our lives until we see
[42:07] the word
[42:08] becoming flesh even as your prophet said
[42:10] we're living an
[42:11] hour now but the word is becoming flesh
[42:15] lord help that to be our testimony lord
[42:17] the people of this church
[42:19] god that their word is actually coming
[42:20] and becoming their flesh
[42:22] we see it manifesting out through their
[42:24] flesh
[42:25] because their flesh is completely
[42:27] subject to the word
[42:28] and we see the reflection of christ in
[42:31] their life
[42:32] lord let that be from each and every one
[42:34] of us lord when we look at our past it
[42:36] ain't purty

[42:45] only reflect you in the future lord
[42:47] jesus we want us to be surrendered to
[42:49] you lord
[42:50] we want ourselves to be dead god we hate
[42:53] our own life we hate
[42:55] our self god we want you to live out
[42:57] through us
[42:58] we truly want to be our your disciple
[43:01] lord jesus
[43:02] and we love of you above everything lord
[43:04] jesus we want everything in our lives
[43:07] to be centered on you father
[43:11] we ask god your blessing upon every
[43:12] heart and every end
