things that we have need of hearing and we just ask god that you would come in a special way let your holy spirit just be here we invite you lord to come and minister to our needs lord jesus and to speak to us father as we worship you and as we have gathered lord and come from different places lord jesus to gather to worship you in spirit and in truth to bring honor and glory to your name lord and to let you know how much we love you lord we just ask god that you'll bless the meditation of our heart this morning father and bless the words that we're about to say father may you just have be in every word that we speak father this morning bless the reading of your word father we ask for the inspiration of it lord jesus and from it and we just ask these blessings and favors in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen so if you will turn your bibles this morning and we'll go to the book of matthew and i think we'll go with let me see here which one do i want 13 matthew 13 first i have several different scriptures that i want to read but in matthew 13 and we'll begin with verse 18. hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart this is he which receiveth seed by the wayside but he that receiveth the seed in stony places the same is he that heareth the word an anon with joy receiveth it yet hath not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation and persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that receiveth seed unto the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some 100 fold some 60 and some 30. may god had his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning amen i want to speak on really kind of two different subjects but one will tie into the other one i want to talk about identification and god's mirrors amen god's mirrors amen so that's what we want to speak on this morning with the help of the lord amen [Applause] i want to start with a story that we're all familiar with but i want to read it just to lay a foundation i don't know i'm sure everybody's probably heard this maybe not everybody out there but other bands as a little boy one time down here in kentucky raised up in the mountains and he'd never been around where there was a looking glass and he had a little piece tacked up on a tree but he'd never seen himself so here he come to louisville it was told to stay with his mother's sister and he lived in one of the nice homes old-fashioned home and when they in went into one of the bedrooms it had a door that had a mirror all the way up and down the door and when a little fellow started to run through the house he stopped now little johnny little johnny and then he scratched his head and little johnny in the mirror scratched his head he laughed and little john in the mirror laughed he jumped up and down a little johnny jumped up down in the mirror see he walked up real close and he thought it was a little boy he could play with so he walked up directly and he pecked on the glass he turned around and his parents was watching him he said mama that's me amen but the baby says now you look in this one amen and he's talking about the bible how many believes that this bible is god's mirror this is god's mirror amen and every time that we come to church every time you open this bible every time you get into the word of god you look into god's mirror amen and you know it's kind of different but that mirror and our age especially i believe that this mirror you know it maybe got a little muddy over the dark ages and people really didn't understand justification and sanctification and the new birth and what the holy ghost really was and all these things but i believe god has cleared it up don't you believe that he cleared it up tied up all the loose ends and got everything back together to where when you look in this mirror when you read the bible you can actually identify yourself amen it shows you who you are and so prophet makes its statement like this you look in this one he says which is you which one of these little johnnies are you impersonating which one is you see you're one of them that's one of them he's you would turn back he says the first little flaw and so forth but that's a different thought he says test it with the word and see if it's right now look in the mirror of god's word if he was to look in the mirror of god's word in other ages to see what group of these three that you'd be identified with this is another quote out of three kinds of believers but ibrahim says there's only three kinds of believers in the world only three kind of people in the world there's a make-believer a believer and an unbeliever isn't that right amen so there's only three kinds no matter what race no matter what it is amen you're either unbeliever or you're a hypocrite or a real genuine believer now i just want to start with saying this that uh it's very important amen it's very important because i'm here to tell you that you got to be very careful because you know it's as hard to look in this mirror sometimes and to identify your own fault as it is for you to be able to see your own fault how many knows we're we're geniuses at not being able to see our own faults now right amen and i believe it takes god's light of god's word and the holy spirit for people to actually be able to see their fault to be able to see what they really look like who they really are let me stop this and also and we know that people don't really learn from history uh you know john michael uh brother john you know john had to learn his lessons i had to learn my lessons we all had to learn our lessons didn't we you know it doesn't matter how much our parents knew what experience they had we also had to go through the same troubles we also had to go through uh trials and tests and experience the same things they had to trust that you know god don't have no grandchildren every son that comes to god must be tried everything must be tested and and and the next generation you have grandkids guess what they have to learn the same thing they'll have to find out who they are it's very very important and i believe uh you know i may say this that i believe that between the ages of 14 and 20 21 it's who you're gonna find who you really are i bear record of this because if you remember brother branham said that most people that actually get born again and serve god do it in that time frame and that right that's what he taught us most of them do it in that time frame and then people get begin to tend to sit into whatever they're going to be through their 20s 30s 40s and 50s don't mean that they can't get saved any time during that and that nobody does that doesn't name that at all but most generally that's the time that people get set in their ways that's most generally when they decide which route they're going to go because those are the time that you have to make a choice on which direction you're going to go what you're going to become whether it's a christian whether it's a just a pretty good person or whether it's a criminal or whether it's whatever it is amen and each age each age has to every young person you have to decide who you are what you're going to be amen that right because for me it was that i think about 20 19 20 years old is when the lord had mercy on me isn't that right and i said i believe that i'm the son of god i want to be god's child and that's something there was some calling in there and god saved me at the age of about 20 or something like that and 21 i got married i believe it was i think it was 21. and so you know and ever since that experience with almighty god i realized who i was and what i wanted to be and amen and i looked in the mirror of god's word and amen and whatever that word said i wanted to follow it 100 i wanted to find my identification in the word of god i found my identification in this right here but remember this here this is let me just say something else that when we come to church and we look in the mirror sometimes we don't like what we see now there's a big difference between people playing tapes and having a minister right ministering the word because you can play whatever tape you want amen and you can pretty much put out and let me tell you something we as human beings every one of us is uh very prone to sit there and have pitchfork religion we can amen when we know something's being said about somebody else but we're totally silent and don't even acknowledge it when it shouldn't be when it when it's actually coming to you people have a absolute a barricade i mean i'm one of these big old stone block barricades they have to take a lift to set on amen when it comes to allowing the word coming in and showing them where they're on where their fault is because i guarantee all of us will be at the altar more if the holy spirit shows you where you're wrong at because remember this one thing the prophet of god said amen that if we come to church for any other reason then to find out where our bad places are then we've come for the wrong purpose we come to look in the mirror of god's word and find out where our bad places are not the neighbors bad places but the devil that's what the devil does to us oh brothers also needed that since the souls don't need that we're good at that amen instead of listening now how can i apply what the preacher is saying to my life amen and and after a while i want to show you that's god's mirror amen we ultimate the ministers and christians ultimately are god's mirror amen and sometimes the reflection is so bright amen the holy spirit and god through his word reflects that so much until the audience and the congregation get so mad that they bashed people's heads in brother bile are you going a little extreme no i'll show you in scripture where it happened people don't like what they see people don't like what they hear huh even jesus says you know i have come and i have showed you the light has shown you the right way he says now your sin is open before you now you have no more excuse when the true light comes and it shines and you say you see you realize it's the truth then you can't hide anymore amen is that okay when i think about this i'm thinking about that this is my job you know right i said lord help us not a job that's coveted we have to be ordained to it is that right but it has to be and god's servants do it each and every one of you have a job and that is to be a reflector of god's word in your neighborhood amen but you know when i got to thinking about this i think i thought about what brother branham said about the symphony and how it has a certain two and there's different players i mean those and really that this whole creation it's been god's symphony and the god has had a music sheet the man that that means something to people that are listening and there's different players playing different parts right like peter and the wolf and i mean one person might change clothes many times become many other things and he said that's the way it was with god god changed where he dwells in whether it was a pillar fire in the old testament or jesus in the new or or his people here in the last days he changed his masses so forth but each one has a part part to play and how many believes each and every one of us play a part we play a part some part amen amen we're going to play the part of a believer or we're going to make play a part of a make-believer or the part of an unbeliever now let me just say this that i believe that in the day of judgment someday people sins and some someday people are really going to be shown the mirror okay on the day of judgment god is going to show everybody there's not going to be one thing that was ever dark done in dark or even a thought that you ever had that won't be brought to the forefront and god will show you what you really was no matter how much you tried to deceive yourself because the multitude of people i believe it's only the bible talks about the whole world is deceived by the antichrist people don't really ever and especially make believers and unbelievers or especially make believers amen there's so many people amen that'll be on that day thinking that they were right but they were wrong now right and on that day it'll be shown where they were wrong at but i believe the true believer catches it now right because as we come to church and when we come to church what are you listening out there when you hear the word of god when you come to church and you hear the word of god going forth it's actually judgment going forth peter says you know the judgment must begin at the house of god our bad places that we see come out here is that right this is where it comes out at this is where you have to have an open heart say well is this the way that i am you know is this how does this apply to me amid it say and then say god oh my and there you are your sin is exposed and the bad that you are is exposed and you either have to get mad about it you have to say no i refuse to believe it it ain't me block it out of your mind in that right or you can say that's exactly you know let's just take one little illustration i believe it was last part in the last week or two i talked about you know if you got a temper we all got a temper probably if we push too hard amen we probably all do you might not think you do but just wait a little bit find out you know and and i i want to tend to believe i hardly do but hey sometimes i still do i say oh boy you know but you know just to acknowledge but hey you know i lost my temper with my wife my husband i lost my temper and i ain't no way that i can get the holy ghost unless i make that rhyme because like it takes a little flight right there you know amen and if you're not willing to acknowledge that you're gonna you're gonna live in deception your whole time but that light comes out and then you say god i don't want to be that way take it away now the good thing about judgment in the house of god you're seeing being judged here is that it goes on up beforehand and guess what's up there up there right now there is a tub of bleach and it goes through that blood and it goes into the sea of god's forgetfulness that's why we come to church for us to look in the mirror of god's word to let our sins to go up to get purified to get cleansed of forgiveness because the white throne judgment it doesn't have any mercy this is the only place that judgment is that there's mercy there's grace there's forgiveness some men sins go beforehand unto judgment others follow after the bible says amen but i think you can understand now i want to read the scripture for it so here we find that jesus begin to uh in a parable tell us of the different kinds of there is isn't that right something that you know they get you hear the word but they don't understand it now what good does the word do if you don't understand it hello when do go on after i said if you don't understand what i'm saying what good does it do nick absolutely nothing it doesn't doesn't be any good if you don't understand it that's the way the word is you might think you understand but if it doesn't really sink down into here it's gone when you go out the horse it didn't do anything for you that's what jesus says the devil quickly just takes it away it's gone but others it sinks down a little bit isn't that right it sinks down and they begin to oh wow yeah hallelujah and it talks about my day rejoice for a while but guess what by and by persecution hardship comes with it god just don't leave you in a bed of ease all your life now he lets the heart think coming to tests come the trials come and all of a sudden you know i'm just not willing to do all this life was better when i was a sinner life was better the other way huh or there's the other class where they know that it's the truth but they're because of the persecution that comes like remember the family the mom and dad of the young man whose eyes were blind isn't that right and jesus opened his blind eyes and the pharisees came to him and if you confess jesus christ you would be put out of the synagogue you would be put out of church and they knew that it was right but yet they wouldn't confess it because and what would he say he was 18. can you imagine say well my son's 18 he's of age ask him i don't want to get in trouble about this people don't want to actually suffer from the gospel they don't want to actually suffer a reproach they don't want to be put out of the church people don't want to quit their church when they know it ain't right for some odd reason or other the prophet of god call it jellyfish people without spying and they're right without backbone and they just want to go along and that's what the parents did i don't know about you but i'm just little i think i tend to believe that i'm a little bit more like peter huh i go a little bit too far sometimes but if my son was blind all his life and get somebody amen prayed for him and he got his his sight back i'd be saying i'll tell you exactly who did it all right wouldn't we all be that way i'd tell you who it is it was jesus of nazareth that's one well we don't know from where he is he's not a goddess out of the other we know what he's isn't that what the young man said to them they asked him who and how he opened his eyes he said jesus of nathan they said they don't know who he is and so forth and the young man reproved them he says wait a minute you're the religious people you are the priest you there ain't nobody higher than you you are the religious people today and here come from what it comes does something ain't never been done and and you don't know from where he is they got mad because they didn't like their fault shown building they didn't like their fault shown and so guess what they put him out of the synagogue and he says oh you're all together a sinner and so forth he's holy and righteous pharisees you know huh but think about the parents there that could not put up with the reproach and the persecution of of standing up for the word and that's the way it is with the message of the hour let me tell you something i believe that message of the hour is of god amen i'm not ashamed we're not ashamed there's people that are they cannot pull back let me go on so now i notice i like this but you got to identify if you lived in an other age you've got to be identified with a certain group of people you're in a certain class you're a certain kind of person that's right amen whether it was way back in the days of noah whether it was in jesus time brother ben makes this statement he says look you're in one of these classes and your present state right now this present state of mind that you are here in this visible audience and you that will be in the invisible audience on this tape your present state of mind after listening to this tape proves to you what class that you're in did he tell you exactly where you are amen whether you're a believer in the word and will stay with it or whether you would walk out or shut the tape off see that tells you what they've done there how many knows it's easy when the preacher is preaching hallelujah praise god we're all it but when he begins to step on your toes when the truth begins to be told then how do you react then that's the question that's where it really comes down to where the rub really comes down to amen amen and the lord has a way of showing us sometimes things that we really don't like to see amen but we must see him amen i'm going to start with john the baptist now first of all let me say this we know that christ is in his body now and we're a representation of the moon how many knows we represent the church represents the moon the stars of course is god's servants and so forth amen his messengers and so forth but the moon represents the church amen and the moon actually has how much light of its own absolutely no light of its own why it is only reflects the sun on the other side of the earth amen and is so bright but on a full moon when you've got snow on the ground you don't even need a flashlight you can walk around because i've been young and i've been taking many sled rides in the dark on the full moon and they met and quite because you brought that much light down and we're a reflection we're a type of that moon amen and we're also a type that we are reflectors we are god's mirrors hello this is god's mirror but we're also mirrors and god takes his word and he brings it down into our hearts and then it goes out that direction amen all right so john the baptist he was a reflector of god's word amen and in matthew the third chapter we'll just look at it matthew 3. i want to talk about john the baptist we will talk about jesus paul for just a little bit and then also brother stephen we want to talk about stephen for just a minute that were reflectors of the light amen that showed amid people what they really looked like right because i'll tell you this right now i truly believe that the bride of jesus christ at this time listen to me everybody i believe that the bride of jesus christ is taking a real hard look at herself i believe she is being diligent that you may be found of him without spot blameless is that right we don't want no spot we don't want none of ourself now i'm going to say something as a pastor sometimes i try to preach i preach so hard let's make sure that we absolutely want to in our hearts only do what god tells us to do only what this scripture tells us to do and yet people will get slack you preach that it's like it doesn't take an effect at all people go the opposite direction rather than saying god what is your perfect will that's what i want to do they do things that's just the other direction huh it's like water off a duck's back amen but i know there's believers i know there's children of god that he goes down and he brings forth 30 fold or 60 fold or a hundredfold i don't know about you but i want to be one of those class don't you i don't want to be those that fall by the wayside because of persecution and just that or the other now notice john the baptist in those days john the baptist was preaching in the wilderness verse 1 of chapter 3 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this is that which is spoken of by the prophet isaiah is saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight his paths and the same john had his raiment of camel's hair and a leather and girdled about his loins and his meat was locust and wild honey he and then went out to him jerusalem and all judea and all the regions round about jordan and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism baptism he said unto them generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee the wrath that is to come huh can you imagine what a reflection he looked at those scribes those pharisees how many know she knew the attitude they had he knew what they were all about he called them a bunch of snakes look in this word i'm here to tell you that you're a snake in the grass huh i imagine they didn't like the mirror too much do you didn't like that too much oh my but he says bring forth fruit meat for repentance and don't think to say within ourselves with your enlarged garments and broad and so forth outwardly look righteous and all this other and say oh we're abraham's seed where abraham don't be starting to say that stuff we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise children unto abraham and now the ax is laid to the root of the trees whoa therefore every tree which bringeth forth good fruit is hewn down and cast that brings not forth good fruit it's hewned down and cast into the fire amen so he was rough on him he told them just what what was going on and what they really were that they were actually snakes in the grass vipers amen now let's go over and talk with look at what jesus said look at jesus he come into contact with the pharisees also amen i believe it was uh let's go to by the wayside matthew 21 matthew 21 hold on 31-32 you see if i have that right yeah here's the first one and the second one will be matthew 23. all right so here jesus is preaching and uh he asks him a question verse 27. he says indeed 27 actually 25 he was asking the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reason with themselves saying if we save from heaven he will send us why did he not then believe him but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither i thee by what authority i duty thinks but what think he a certain man had two sons and think about jesus was so wise that even though he wasn't going to tell him that he was still going to get the point across a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work today in my vineyard he said and he answered and said i will not but afterwards he repented and went and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said i go sir and he went not whether of them twain did the will of his father and they say i am the first and jesus says unto them he says verily i say unto you that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of god before you for john came unto you in the way of the wilderness and you believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when he had seen it repented not afterwards that ye might believe him amen look at the rebuke that jesus gave to those pharisees he says look amen to heartless and prostitute they're going to the kingdom of god before you do didn't brother bam say he says you know i had more cooperation with the witch doctors and everybody over in america african than these bunch of preachers over here in america he had better cooperation he says you know uneducated heath and there's a lot easier to deal with than that educated one amen and an educated one heathen is somebody that won't believe god even though they claim to be a christian amen how many know this generation got a true look at what they were really like folks when the prophet came out in the seals and he really tell told us what denomination or what churches were really all about amen and how that how horrible it really was what did they do they put him out they wouldn't have the prophet back anymore they wouldn't have none of that discernment going on anymore i believe that's part of the reason there and identification brother brown there thompson talked about how that you know that it was like there's so many in the holidays they had to go so far with him like those seventy they went so far with him but then he said something that they just couldn't stop me it was contrary to their teaching he says unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me is that right and they just couldn't take and those seven days he says who can hear this and the seventy left amen they left he wouldn't walk with him no more and then even jesus said to his own disciples will you also go away amen folks i want to be in that class right there where you say to whom shall we go where are you going to go thou alone has the worst of eternal life see even nicodemus knew nicodemus knew isn't that right he came to jesus by night he says we know that no man can do these things unless god is with him you can't raise the dead healed to sicken that forth so forth unless god is with him we know that but you know because of my popularity i had to come in the dark i had to wear my hoodie my dark glasses you know and hide and not be seen coming to see jesus or i might get put out see ashamed of the real truth amen so now notice here's one of them but let's look again the scribes in the pharisees and i'm going to say this again the sad part is that people that don't take a real good look at themselves are going to be deceived amen and there's going to be the majority of the world is that way they don't take a good look at their self see where they really are amen because i'm here to tell you take a good look at yourself take a real good look at yourself amen and i'll tell you this right now every time that you said something that was not quite right huh just like brother branham when he went outside of there and he says you know tell him i'm not here he went outside the door and tell him i'm not here by the time his wife said he's not here he was probably out inside but the holy spirit wouldn't let him live with that woody no he couldn't even pray for somebody why those little things it showed him hey you know that ain't right you know and when we all you know you all each and every one of you we look at ourselves you might find more of that than what you really realize you'll see your faults but if you don't man if you deceive yourself it's never your fault it's always somebody else's fault it's always some other reason some other cause no god said you know god's not gonna it's not gonna be good on the judgment day god's gonna ask you about you and that right okay let's go with jesus and look what he had to say here if i can find it here all right in g in matthew 23 13 let me see if i got that one right yes matthew 23 13 will begin all right and he was preaching to him and he was talking about how the greatest of among you shall be servant of all and so forth and whosoever shall exalt himself to your base he that humbles himself shall be exalted but woe unto you scribes and pharisees for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for you neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are to entering in to go in notice go unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you devour widows houses and for pretense make long prayers he was really telling them how they were therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation woe unto you scribes pharisees for you can pass land and sea to make one proselyte and that right and when he is made you make him twice the child of hell than you are yourselves what he do blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a deader ye fools and blind for whether is greater than gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty he fools and blind i don't know about you but sitting in the congregation you looked at and called you fool and blind you hypocrite you snake in the grass that would be hard to take it was hard for them to take but it was the truth all right let's go on down to verse 23 woe up to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and coming amen and have committed the weightier matters of the law omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment and mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone you blind guides which strain out of that and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes pharisees hypocrites for you may clean the outside of the cup of the platter but within you are full of extortion and excess he was really getting on the money he was painting them a picture this is what we really are up to now maybe john the baptist corrected you but up to now you've just kind of had your way but it's time that you find out who you really are i don't think i'll even get to it here i don't think it's in here but remember he talks about getting into an argument with about whose father he was and they called him the devil and so forth and beelzebub and he ended up saying no you are of your father the devil a true picture he told him exactly what they were of amen and we'll get when we get to stephen we'll kind of find out and and talk about how that israel within israel how many within within israel there were three kinds of believers that right it was a real believers joshua and caleb the real genuine believers and most of the rest of them were unbelievers or make believers amen and it was those make believers that had always that jesus is talking to right here now notice full of access and extortion thou blind pharisees cleanse first that which is within the cup of the platter that the outside may be clean also how many believes that's what we believe that a person has to get clean on the inside because you know we want people clean on the outside yes we do but guess what if you are clean on the outside and you still not clean the inside you're still as lost as can be but the idea is to get first get the inside clean and then it'll take care of itself amen woe unto you scribes pharisees hypocrites for you're like into white ed tombs or sepulchers which indeed a pure beautiful artwork but are within full of death man's bones what a reflection in other words we put the light of god on you all we see is skeleton here folks that casket is beautiful man it's got gold decorations out around isn't that what our caskets look like our caskets look beautiful man it'd be a nice place to lay down at but it's a god i don't want to be laying in it to you it's beautiful but inside it's just a dead person that's exactly what jesus said if you take a good look at yourself pharisees and scribes you look good on the outside and you like the uppermost seats and you like to be called rabbi and you know all these other but inside you're full of dead men's bones amen my what a picture to paint for him dead man's bone and of all uncleanness amen this comes to my mind i believe it's the prophet of god that illustrated a woman that'll wear the garment that pertains to a man that it's an abomination you go into one of these bathrooms he said that is so stinky and so horrible so unclean until you just wanna you just walk out say look i'm gonna go down to the next town or the next gas they might use in that it's just a terrible the more thing you can imagine that's what it smells like that's what it's like an abomination in the side of god a true picture of what it really is amen now notice even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity what do you scribe pharisees hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulcher of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our father we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets lord we'd have been on the right side we'd have been in the right group if we'd have been back there but brother abraham even says here in your present state in your present mind the way that you are now shows whose side you would have been on who you really are amen wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them which killed the prophets fill you up the measure of your fathers you serpents you generation of vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell what a picture to pick somebody how many knows another place jesus said they took up stones to stone him he preached and he painted them such a picture until they got so mad and they picked up stones and stoned him and he had to vanish through the midst of them how many knows jesus could do a disappearing act it wasn't his time to go he walked right through the middle of him they couldn't even see it wasn't his time when he preached he let the mirror put the held up the mirror in front of him this is what you really look like you're a generation of vipers and snakes outside you look good but what do you look like in here i mean at least that's what we got to ask ourselves what do we look like in here amen mine praise be to god and i believe i'm preaching to a group amen that is of the uh joshua and caleb i don't believe anybody here is ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ to witness to anybody that god gives you an opportunity to to stand for the word of god amen but little further listen he says degeneration of vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell wherefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify was that it was the jews that said crucify him crucified they're the ones that had him crucified anyway that's why the jews get so much flack do you know why the jews get hated by a lot of people why there's what they call anti-semitism is because they killed the lord and people hold that against them huh because he take the ones that killed jesus and so forth but we know that god had blinded their eyes amen he knew they'd be that way and he did it for us amen we've got to say thank you lord have mercy off on them have them great that was where it was predicted to go people and some of them you shall scourge in your synagogue and persecute them from city to city so we can say what you do with god's scribe what you do with god's wise man what you do with the word of god today is what you'd have done with it back then well i don't want to be called no holy roller i don't want to be called no branhamite huh i don't know about you but even nicodemus he said i ain't nobody can do these things unless he of god i mean if ain't no brother bannon could have never done these things unless god was with him now people might want to go somewhere else and i don't know i never can't understand a person can leave the message i have to really have a revelation of it i don't believe you can if you've got a real revelation of it maybe a mental understanding but a real revelation you can't never walk away from it because to whom shall we go let me say this god may think there may be things in this message that you just don't understand you just can't really get past it but what do you say i don't understand it i don't know why jesus told them unless you eat my flesh and make my blood but abandon one place he said he'd said that to thin down the crowd am i right sometimes he'll say anything it's nothing but the truth but he'll find out whether they are going along with him just for the meat and for the food or whether they're really going to believe his word whether they understand it or not because one thing we know for sure is that no man could have ever done these things unless it was of god and there ain't nowhere else to go but jesus christ he alone has the words of eternal life amen all right we're going to stop there persecute from city to city and then of course he talks about you know all the all the blood of righteous abel to sacrifice it all comes down on them o jerusalem doubted kill us the prophets the stoneless them that are sent thee i guess i will read it how often i would have gathered the chickens together even as the hens gathered her brood and you would not i can say it thus saith the spirit thus saith the word of god that jesus did very same thing in our generation even the prophet said if i could see the baptist in the mess of us and everybody come together and love the lord i could say you know let your servant depart in peace he tried to get him all back to the word back to christ now how you would have gathered them but they would not and that's where they are amen one more before i go to stephen let's go one more over here where jesus talks about uh in matthew 7 verse 15 he says beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening rules how many believes the things that you do show who you are the decision to make shows you are shows who you are everything you do shows who you are then he says you shall look them by their fruit amen how many remember i'm talking about uh a justified person sanctified person or person that's all the way inside of the holies of holies a justified person come to church and whoo praise be to god he's justified maybe even sanctified he could shout and so forth you know but they got they can't barely blast from one revival to another it isn't just automatically coming drinking from the spring but they have to be pumped up and primed huh lord help us not to be that way we gotta come to church and get primed up let me get no you come primed already you come in tune already drinking at the well even that springing up into everlasting life that's where we want to be he says you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of fizzles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a crop tree bring forth good fruit in other words sooner or later what you do and what's going to come out what you are is going to come out amen every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them now notice not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven now i'm not going to go to it i don't think it's here yeah it is now notice he says which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name and many mighty and wonderful works we spoke in tongue we had miracles happen we had this out of the other but we kicked your prophet out we could you out when you would come and discern thoughts and intense we wouldn't have no part of that huh see there's a group in the unbelieving world in the make-believing world that have a cane religion that cane religion is we're going to do it our way i can make it the way i want to come i'll bring fruits i ain't got to go out there and get no lamb and cut its throat and have blood splattering everywhere and get it all over me and get all messy you know and say god forgive me i should be this lamb i should die for my sin you know identified with his son i don't want to know no he didn't want to do all he brought the fruit and you know when god corrected him he would not be corrected cain religion is that when that correction comes and you don't take that correction you are identified as religion like cain lord help me lord if you want to correct me here i am correct me who the lord loveth he chastens us chastises corrects amen and if you're a son and daughter of god if you're a joshua and caleb you say boy i'll tell you what lord show me where i'm wrong at i want to be right i want to have everything right now notice here this is the group that on that day notice they'll come and say that and then when i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity you knew better but you just refused to do it amen therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i would liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon rock the reigns descended and the floods came we certainly have had that this morning and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock how many knows that's exactly what happened with the disciples now ultimately we know that disciples ended up forsaking jesus but that was a different story because they were not converted yet they didn't have the holy ghost yet because peter after he got the holy ghost and converted it was going to hang him upside crucify him and he says don't cruise me find me upright like him i'm not worthy to be hung in the same way to hit hang me upside down peter was one of these real rumbunctious i guess you would call it guys that went a little bit too far he went 150 whatever he did right because whenever jesus was going to wash his feet and he says you'll never wash my feet no you ain't going to get down there watch me you're my lord you know and jesus if i watch you not i have no power with me then he goes overboard he says well not just my feet but my hands and my head also peter's like jesus would you just settle down and remember when jesus peter says you know i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll die with you and so forth jesus said no i know you're enthusiastic peter but before the cockroach christ you'll deny me twice you'll throw deny me thrice that's the kind of peter kind of person that peter was i mean if peter had a revelation no matter what happened no matter how much he cried not much how much he repented when jesus came back amen peter fell right in line he kept believing all the way amen they were sure they were discouraged but through it all they hang in there amen praise the lord and that's how we want to be that no matter what happens no matter what comes or what goes we stay faithful to the lord jesus christ amen because we're walking into a certain part of the symphony now we're in the last days when luke warmness is all around us when it's easy to let the cares of life and they're right the cares of life choke out the spiritual life that's in you amen i'll tell you what it's easy to get away from god and it's easy to not have your prayer like you should in the morning i had my prayer in the morning but on the way to church amen with all of this flood coming down i wasn't looking at the negative i said lord i know it's you because your bible i read over over there and i believe he's probably before he talks he is the one that brings rain down amen to give a thirsty world water and i said boy you're sure giving the world a lot of good water thank you for the water lord we need it thank you lord for my you take care of the birds you take care of the animal world you take care of us thank you lord you're just a wonderful provider you provide for everything you're awesome god amen just keep god real in your hearts don't let the cares of this world don't fall in that category identification that the cares of this life is choked out your fervency and your love for the lord jesus christ because that's what this really ought to see and remember this layout is here that's what the devil has called that's what its whole purpose is is just to drown us with the cares of this world the pleasures of this world because it's not to have amen anymore god help us never to become unidentified it's a church where there's no hallelujahs no amens it's about got icicles hanging off of these here ceilings up here everything's so cold and everybody's so started never be identified that but free in the spirit the holy spirit can move god can do stuff and amen amen believes he is but i just want to see more and i say god this is where i want to be identified amen because i believe as i wrote here one place he says you know that he went god made a supper right and he invited all of his friends and all of those relatives to come and all of those relatives said they had an excuse well we can't come because of this and we can't come because of that although they made excuses and he says those people are not going to have any part but he says talk to servants now go out into highways and the hedges i believe it was three different places go out and die to neighbor and so forth there was still room he says now go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in so that i will have people and my supper that right to me i was one of those that was in the highways and the hedges i wasn't religious i was unworthy amen just nobody and nothing but yet he went out into those highways and those hedges amen and he found me amen called and i'm thankful that i responded aren't you glad you responded to that call that god gave you to come in and to dine with him to sup with him amen when there's so many putting them out people not really wanting to look in the mirror of god's word anymore people don't want to be honest with themselves so like all i can tell you this morning is be honest with yourself look in the mirror of god's word and see if you are you know and and he said brother branham used it and said that boy seen his reflection right but when we look into this we don't want to see our reflection we want to see his reflection we want to see christ reflected in our lives that it reflects christ yes that's me no we're not like nathan and cora amen i told you i was going to go with steven yet let's talk about stephen for a few minutes is that okay let's turn to acts the book of acts and stephen as you know he was brought up before the council all right let me see way back and he preached him a sermon we're not going to get into that if you want to read that whole sermon that he gave it he gave all the way from started in the seventh chapter of acts amen he's talked about abraham coming from mesopotamia amen to dwell in the land of charan and so forth and how did god called him and so forth but in verse chapter 6 the last verse it says and all that sat in the console looking steadfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel and stephen was given an opportunity to speak to that whole council and he preached them a message of how god uh started with abraham and come into egypt and all the way down and then i want to pick a thought up over in the wilderness he stopped in the middle the middle of the wilderness any in verse 37 he says and this that moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like and unto me him shall ye hear and this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with an angel which spake to him in the mount sinai and with our fathers whom received the lively oracles to give unto us to whom our fathers would not obey now if you'll notice stephen ties these pharisees in with the ones that would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back unto egypt saying unto aaron this is how he turned them away didn't want moses no more they wanted to go back to egypt okay turn back again to egypt saying on the air make us a gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we will what not we don't know what is become of him and they made a calf in those days and offered the sacrifice unto an idol and rejoice in the works of their hands and then he goes on to talk about how that god rejected him for it but let's go over here to verse about 48 we will read it all hobby at the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstall what footstool what else will ye build me saith the lord what is the place of my rest have not my hands made all these things ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the holy ghost this is what stephen was telling that congregation told them look as your fathers did so do ye remember he mentioned about nathan the corn there and so forth he says as your fathers did so do you stephen is painting him a picture of who they really are in that console to the whole sanhedrin council he's saying you stiff-necked an uncircumcised of heart and ears listen to what he says which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one whom ye have been now betrayers and murderers he calls them a bunch of traitors and murderers to their face just like your fathers whom ye who who have received the law by dispensation of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth just what that means i don't know if he just bunch of just talking real bad about him if they actually beat him i don't know gnashed on him with their teeth in other words the picture that he held the mirror up say this is where you guys are at you did that back there you wanted to go back to egypt back there you never would believe in that right and now you've taken the just one that abraham did you claim the followings of earth moses he says do you know god is going to raise up a prophet like an unto me and he did it and you are the murderers of him my and he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god and said behold i see heavens open and the son son of man standing at the right hand of god and then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears they began screaming and hollering and shutting their ears i ain't listening to this no more i ain't gonna hear this no more that was terrible can you imagine the people that would be shown the mirror of how they really are they don't want to and let me tell you something if you ain't a child of god you don't want to be hearing what you what you really are i don't want to hear i ain't going to listen to it that's how they were they were i ain't gonna listen to it i ain't gonna hear amen oh my and upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their coats at a young man's feet whose name was saul amen and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit it makes it sound like the one stoning stephen was calling upon the lord but i don't believe that's how that means it and they stoned stephen calling upon god saying lord jesus receive my spirit i believe jesus was saying here i am receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep we sing this song there was peter and paul and john the devine who gave their lives blood so this gospel could shine it talks about stephen they dashed his head in is that right dashing his head on because he showed them the true picture of how they were sometimes when the mirror reflects through god's servants or you know sometimes kids at school you'll dress right and they'll make fun of you and they'll despite you just because they feel condemned because they know they should you know right they don't like it just because that light is reflecting out through you to others and people will hate you for it amen but how many beliefs each and every one of us is a reflector of the word of god amen let's stand this morning stephen was paul was amen jesus was john was prophet of god in this generation was and even though jesus christ would come and do all those miracles that he would do after he was finished preaching people still did what they might as well done that he might as well just that no huh then brother ben says well you know even when he began to talk about paul when paul was testifying to israel who had really wanted to kill paul because he had went and become a christian and so forth found themselves not to eat or drink until he was dead but he had seen a vision paul would just testify of the vision that he saw and how he was struck down this is all i can tell you is what happened to me huh they didn't want to hear it and then brother branham went there and he began to tell holland and when he was young and how that angel came to him he began to say this stuff and he says there was a whole row of ministers in the back he says when he began to bring up paul he says they know where he was going they got up and left they all went up went out can you imagine what they look like in god's sight can you imagine what the mirror looks like for them or for the 70 just because they couldn't quite understand what he said walked away something happened amen let's bow our heads i don't know but i want to be in that group like peter like the disciples that no matter what happened to whom shall we go no matter what happens i believe it with all of my heart like stephen that though they slay me people people even get upset with god sometimes because of the things that they go through but i want to be like david says though he slay me yet i'll trust him no matter what happens i'll still believe in god i want to be a real genuine believer i don't want to be a make-believer i don't want to get over on that day i don't want to be a part of the group that comes over on that day and thinks that you had and thinks that you was all right and you wasn't because you really deceived yourself you didn't take a good enough look you wasn't honest enough with yourself how many this morning would raise their hand say god help me to be honest help me be honest with myself and let me look in the mirror of your word every time i read your bible or listen to a tape lord and there's something that isn't there that it shouldn't be there i pray god you take it out i confess all my faults lord help me to be like stephen that no matter if they even slay me no matter what would happen i could have that perfect love and say god don't lay it at their charge lord each one with their hands raised we want that in our hearts our lives lord we want that perfect love god no matter what comes or goes you allow things come our way to test us to try us to see whether we'll fall by the wayside or whether we won't or whether we'll stand true to your word not ask god this morning that every hand that is up lord jesus that you'd help them to have a closer walk with you father that you'd let them be in that group that's a genuine believer not be like that net that was cast the gospel net jesus talked about many different kinds of fishes they may have caught but we want to be that true fish that real fish got that trout so to speak that is to be kept lord jesus that's faithful to bring forth whatever you've ordained us
