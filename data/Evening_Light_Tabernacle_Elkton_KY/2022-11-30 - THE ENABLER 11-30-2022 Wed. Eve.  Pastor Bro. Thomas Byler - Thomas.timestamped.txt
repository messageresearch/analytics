[57:07] and Caleb Still the people before Moses
[57:10] said let us go up at once and possess it
[57:12] for we are well able to overcome it
[57:16] but the men that went up with him said
[57:19] we be not able to go up against the
[57:22] people for they are stronger than we are
[57:24] and they brought an evil brought up an
[57:26] evil report of the land which they had
[57:29] searched unto the children of Israel
[57:32] saying the land through which we have
[57:34] gone to search it it is a land that
[57:37] eateth up the inhabitants thereof and
[57:39] all the people that we saw
[57:42] are so in it are men of great stature
[57:46] and there we saw the Giants the son of
[57:48] Enoch which come of the Giants and we
[57:51] were in our own side as Grasshoppers and
[57:54] so we're
[57:55] we were in their side

[58:23] all the congregation to murmur against
[58:25] him bringing up his land upon the land
[58:28] even those men that did bring up the
[58:31] evil report upon the land died by the
[58:34] plague
[58:35] before the Lord before the Lord
[58:37] but Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[58:40] son of Jeth and then which were of the
[58:43] men that were in search the land lived
[58:45] still amen so we see the outcome of
[58:48] those who brought up an evil report amen
[58:52] it just comes to me now as I think about
[58:55] how that the Bible tells and says that
[58:58] he that believeth not is condemned
[59:01] already isn't that right so over in the
[59:04] New Testament for those who do not
[59:06] believe amen perhaps don't believe what
[59:09] God has said death is pronounced upon
[59:12] him already isn't it even as these men
[59:15] who brought up an evil report and I
[59:18] think they're that the big problem was
[59:21] with verse 33 it says that we were
[59:25] now notice there's two two things here
[59:27] two places he says and we were in our
[59:30] own sight
[59:31] as grasshoppers
[59:34] amen
[59:36] amen uh you know it brings it down home
[59:39] that a lot of times you are what you
[59:41] think you are
[59:43] you know life has a lot to do with how
[59:45] you look at yourself
[59:48] is that right how look how you how do
[59:50] you look at yourself
[59:52] amen
[59:53] uh you know and it says that we as we
[59:57] were also in their sight you know what
[59:59] they looked at us you know uh it doesn't
[1:00:02] really matter so much but it's matters
[1:00:04] of how they look at themselves
[1:00:07] they looked at themselves completely
[1:00:09] wrong didn't they
[1:00:10] because it wasn't about them in the
[1:00:13] first place
[1:00:14] isn't that right they should have looked
[1:00:16] at the god that they were serving
[1:00:18] because you know David he looked one
[1:00:20] time and you know I'm sure that Goliath
[1:00:23] looked at David as a a dog he's as
[1:00:27] himself he says am I a dog that you sent
[1:00:29] this little weakling you know he looked
[1:00:31] at David as just a weakling uh nothing
[1:00:35] but David how many knows David he was a
[1:00:39] little fitty shrimp of a fella but he
[1:00:41] didn't look at himself as a weakling
[1:00:45] you know because he knew that it wasn't
[1:00:47] about David but it was about the God
[1:00:50] that was with him
[1:00:51] so tonight's uh I want to title this the
[1:00:54] enabler the enabler
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:58] the one that makes things possible amen
[1:01:01] you've heard the saying uh you know uh
[1:01:04] no can do
[1:01:05] how many has ever heard that you know
[1:01:07] somebody wants to you know want
[1:01:09] something from you or whatever he says
[1:01:10] no can do
[1:01:12] you know and that's the way in the
[1:01:14] attitude that the Israel had no can do
[1:01:16] we can't do it
[1:01:18] right I don't know about you but when I
[1:01:20] want a project I know when I want
[1:01:22] something done I like for somebody to
[1:01:24] tell me can do
[1:01:26] yeah no problem we can do it
[1:01:29] amen and so that's what we're going to
[1:01:32] focus on tonight with the help of the
[1:01:33] Lord for a little while amen and uh so
[1:01:38] you know because
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:43] here this this was of course
[1:01:46] looking at the Old Testament now how
[1:01:48] many knows that as brother bam said that
[1:01:50] the Old Testament was a reflection or a
[1:01:52] shadow of the New Testament and as they
[1:01:55] looked and Scattered out so to speak in
[1:01:58] spite out the land they found out that
[1:02:00] it was a good land it was a really good
[1:02:02] thing I mean those that's a type of the
[1:02:05] Holy Ghost brother bam said
[1:02:07] amen the Holy Ghost is a good thing
[1:02:09] Christ is a good thing
[1:02:12] you know but there's some Giants in the
[1:02:14] land there's some things that we Face
[1:02:15] some time that oh it just looks like
[1:02:18] we're grasshoppers compared to what the
[1:02:20] problem is
[1:02:22] you know but how many knows you can
[1:02:23] never take the wrong attitude towards
[1:02:25] that problem
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:29] and no matter how big it looks no matter
[1:02:31] how much how impossible it might seem
[1:02:35] amen the second that you think that you
[1:02:38] can't do it well then that's when you
[1:02:39] can't do it
[1:02:41] amen and it's not always easy amen
[1:02:45] and so but they but you got to keep you
[1:02:48] got to look at it in the right aspect in
[1:02:51] the right way praise be to God so I like
[1:02:54] this
[1:02:55] so
[1:02:57] um you know but you know there's only
[1:02:59] one thing that we one one thing about it
[1:03:01] is that in order to do anything
[1:03:05] first of all
[1:03:07] we realize that we in ourselves and we
[1:03:10] hear this a lot that we in ourselves we
[1:03:13] can't do it
[1:03:15] how many knows that we can't do it you
[1:03:18] can't do a whole lot by yourself you
[1:03:20] know you can't really do anything by
[1:03:21] yourself
[1:03:22] but even Jesus talked about that he was
[1:03:25] the vine that we're the branches he says
[1:03:27] he didn't abideth and me and I and him
[1:03:29] the same bringeth forth much fruit he
[1:03:32] says for without me ye
[1:03:37] can do nothing
[1:03:40] you can do nothing without Christ
[1:03:44] so I mean it's a secret to being a
[1:03:47] person that can't do it
[1:03:49] is somebody that is in Christ
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:54] brother bam says some of you people
[1:03:56] walking along and saying well I just
[1:03:58] can't quit drinking and I just can't
[1:04:00] quit this
[1:04:02] the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to
[1:04:04] make all these camps get away from you
[1:04:09] how many knows my goodness he says you
[1:04:11] know you got to get away amen you know
[1:04:14] there's a can of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:04:16] canner
[1:04:18] I asked Micah today I said you know I
[1:04:20] don't know for sure if there's even a
[1:04:22] word amen enabler enabler I guess that's
[1:04:24] a word
[1:04:26] that's as well if it's my English but a
[1:04:28] brand I'm used by English too and it
[1:04:30] talked about canners and canters
[1:04:32] I don't know if there's a words either
[1:04:34] but I understand what he's saying and I
[1:04:36] guess that's what's important right
[1:04:38] but to get all these kids away from us
[1:04:41] that's right better man in the series of
[1:04:44] what is the Holy Ghost he was preaching
[1:04:46] the Holy Ghost series and what was the
[1:04:47] Holy Ghost given for the Bible says the
[1:04:50] Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make
[1:04:52] all these can't get away from you amen
[1:04:55] make you women quit cutting your hair
[1:04:57] make you men and quit wearing these
[1:05:01] shorts and slacks no excuses presidents
[1:05:05] no excuses amen
[1:05:09] um
[1:05:10] it would make the women come to hair and
[1:05:11] make them wearing shorts and slacks he
[1:05:13] says and make them quit tattling
[1:05:15] oh yeah hey man that's what it's for to
[1:05:18] make you live a holy life
[1:05:21] the holy ghost that will follow the
[1:05:23] instructions of the Bible every time
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:30] Raymond will say well it's just too hot
[1:05:32] I've got the worries he's gives me a
[1:05:35] headache if I don't let if I let my hair
[1:05:36] grow but there's no excuses with the
[1:05:39] Holy Ghost
[1:05:40] it's there to make it so amen it'll
[1:05:43] follow the word just exactly that's what
[1:05:45] the Holy Ghost is to do to make you man
[1:05:48] turn your head from them half naked
[1:05:50] women and quit lusting after them that's
[1:05:53] right
[1:05:54] it's to make you quit smoking and
[1:05:56] drinking and wanna be a big shot it'll
[1:05:59] make take that all out of you it'll
[1:06:01] humble you when you do when you do that
[1:06:03] that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's
[1:06:05] for a holy life make you quit gossiping
[1:06:08] make it quit playing cards shooting
[1:06:10] craps and all these other things that
[1:06:12] you do around the corner it'll make you
[1:06:14] quick you're carrying on the way that
[1:06:16] you're doing living untrue to your wife
[1:06:18] that's what it'll make you quit you want
[1:06:20] to marry somebody else's wife that's
[1:06:22] exactly right that's what it is make you
[1:06:25] live a holy life that's why the holy
[1:06:27] ghost power is for it'll make you set
[1:06:30] your affections and things above where
[1:06:32] Christ sitteth at the right of hand of
[1:06:33] God it'll put in the mind of Christ in
[1:06:36] you
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:43] amen praise the Lord when I got to think
[1:06:46] about that and if it's just come to me
[1:06:47] amen I would guess it was four o'clock
[1:06:49] in the morning and I was just meditating
[1:06:51] on the Lord woke up and and this this
[1:06:53] little quote came where another man have
[1:06:55] got to talk about the cancer and the
[1:06:57] canner and I said Canon Cantor and I
[1:07:00] remembered he talked about you know you
[1:07:01] get the Holy Ghost that can or that
[1:07:04] cancer get away from you that canner
[1:07:07] will come in
[1:07:09] praise be to God I got to thinking about
[1:07:12] the scripture like Paul says I can do
[1:07:14] all things
[1:07:19] I mean
[1:07:21] I can do all of it I know how it is what
[1:07:24] it's like to be a base I know what it's
[1:07:25] like to have much I know what it is like
[1:07:27] to have suffering and all these other
[1:07:29] things
[1:07:31] but Paul he was a person that believed
[1:07:33] that he could do
[1:07:36] oh my
[1:07:38] God oh don't you just love it
[1:07:42] amen Philippians I want to turn to that
[1:07:45] scripture I'm gonna slow down just a
[1:07:47] little bit if that's all right
[1:07:49] Paul says you know I speak in respect of
[1:07:52] want and for I have learned and
[1:07:54] whatsoever State I am there with to be
[1:07:56] content he's all right no matter what
[1:07:58] state he's in
[1:08:00] last chapter of Philippians 4 and verse
[1:08:03] 12. I know both know how to be a base
[1:08:05] and I know how to abound everywhere in
[1:08:08] all things I am instructed both to be
[1:08:11] full or to be hungry both the bound are
[1:08:13] to suffer need
[1:08:15] oh my we could add a whole lot more in
[1:08:18] there he knows what it's like to be
[1:08:20] Shipwrecked he knows what it's like to
[1:08:22] be stoned he knows what he's like to be
[1:08:23] schwepped and left for dead
[1:08:29] he knows how to suffer a need but he
[1:08:31] says I can't do all things through
[1:08:35] Christ which strengthens me
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:43] oh my how many knows what it's it's just
[1:08:46] a whole different world
[1:08:48] there's two worlds that you live in
[1:08:52] you live inside of Christ
[1:08:55] or you live outside of Christ
[1:08:59] how many knows that
[1:09:00] you're either hid away in Christ
[1:09:04] or you're outside of Christ Jesus made
[1:09:06] it plain I'm the mind you're the
[1:09:09] branches if you don't bring forth fruit
[1:09:11] you're cut off if you cut off your
[1:09:13] outside and you withered
[1:09:15] you get outside of Christ you'll wither
[1:09:17] away
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:21] praise be to God
[1:09:25] but in Christ it's a different story all
[1:09:28] things are possible amen
[1:09:30] the Holy Ghost comes to make all these
[1:09:32] things happen you say well I just can't
[1:09:35] do it oh I just can't do it sure you can
[1:09:39] but the Holy Ghost came for that purpose
[1:09:43] so that you could
[1:09:49] amen how many believe that
[1:09:53] Paul says I can do all things through
[1:09:57] Christ which strengtheneth me
[1:09:59] amen
[1:10:01] let's go to another one
[1:10:04] how about Ephesians
[1:10:06] 3
[1:10:12] and 20.
[1:10:14] Ephesians 3 and verse 20
[1:10:17] it says now
[1:10:19] unto him that is able amen
[1:10:23] he's able to do
[1:10:28] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:10:33] can ask or think according to the power
[1:10:35] that worketh in US
[1:10:38] I like that
[1:10:41] praise be God
[1:10:43] I was just you know I I just drive down
[1:10:45] the road and I got to thinking about the
[1:10:46] Lord and I got to thinking you know it's
[1:10:48] so it's something now that we have God
[1:10:50] on board now we love God and how we
[1:10:52] serve God we don't realize
[1:10:54] the power
[1:10:57] that is that our disposable
[1:11:01] the power that God has that basically is
[1:11:05] untouched yet by us a lot of times
[1:11:08] there's no telling what can God can do
[1:11:10] in your life
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:15] and I thought about that you know I'm
[1:11:16] Tim the disabled he is able to do
[1:11:19] exceeding the abundance above all that
[1:11:22] we can ask oh my I like that what's the
[1:11:26] other word that we can ask or
[1:11:30] say it out loud
[1:11:32] think
[1:11:34] amen I like to stretch these little gray
[1:11:37] matters up in here a little bit come on
[1:11:39] now believe a little more think about it
[1:11:42] a little more realizing you've got a God
[1:11:44] that's not just a god of History
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:50] how many believe God can change your
[1:11:52] situation
[1:11:55] you know sometimes the devil will try to
[1:11:57] tell us you know we can't change we
[1:11:59] can't change
[1:12:01] huh and we know preachers tell us you
[1:12:04] can't change your husband you can't we
[1:12:06] can't change each other you can't change
[1:12:09] yourself
[1:12:12] I'll give you and stop there think of
[1:12:14] where you'd be how horrible would it be
[1:12:17] to think that you can't change
[1:12:19] but I'm here to tell you this is what
[1:12:21] this is all about it's all about change
[1:12:24] Paul said that we look into the mirror
[1:12:26] of his word and we change
[1:12:29] from glory to glory
[1:12:33] but a man says that you can't come in
[1:12:35] those double doors and stay the same
[1:12:38] you'll either go out better or you'll go
[1:12:41] out worse
[1:12:42] what would be like that just to go out
[1:12:45] of history and that's the problem is
[1:12:47] people don't believe that God is here
[1:12:49] today amen so they say that oh the Holy
[1:12:52] Ghost was just for the Old Testament or
[1:12:54] for the apostles and so forth amen the
[1:12:56] Bible says that they had to have a form
[1:12:58] of godliness but they would deny the
[1:13:00] power of it
[1:13:03] hey man
[1:13:07] what the power to change us
[1:13:15] can I tell you something else come to my
[1:13:17] mind last week
[1:13:23] I don't know who we are
[1:13:27] it's just like give me my apparently we
[1:13:29] don't know
[1:13:30] who we are yet
[1:13:34] foreign
[1:13:37] what is it
[1:13:42] the reason I come to that conclusion
[1:13:44] because of the rest of the quote that
[1:13:46] President Brown said he says when she
[1:13:48] realizes who she is
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:51] the right should take place
[1:13:54] so we're still here so apparently we
[1:13:56] don't know who we are quite yet
[1:14:02] but we're gonna figure it out aren't we
[1:14:05] we're gonna figure it out that I've been
[1:14:07] better Ted talk about it because I kind
[1:14:09] of contemplated it he was talking about
[1:14:10] the whole mystery it's about you
[1:14:13] I'm like what that's a big word because
[1:14:15] I don't like always thinking about
[1:14:16] myself let's think about him a little
[1:14:17] shall we
[1:14:18] but the Bible clearly says great is the
[1:14:21] victory of Christ which is Christ The
[1:14:23] Mystery of God that it is Christ in you
[1:14:25] the hope of glory that's what the Bible
[1:14:27] said even by the way I'm talking about
[1:14:29] the whole mystery is the revelation of
[1:14:31] you Christ in you
[1:14:37] the bad thing that you and I hope that
[1:14:40] I've kind of wrote down somewhere but
[1:14:41] the bad thing that you and I can have is
[1:14:43] to know that the living Christ is in you
[1:14:47] every single day and you are seeing him
[1:14:51] manifested through
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:14:55] you that God could take these vile frail
[1:14:58] uh uh shortcoming bodies and vessels and
[1:15:01] so forth that we got to repent all the
[1:15:03] time and everything but he could steal
[1:15:04] and happiness in such a way that he
[1:15:07] would fulfill his word and complete his
[1:15:09] mission here through you and I
[1:15:14] am that right
[1:15:16] amen
[1:15:18] wow
[1:15:20] how am I
[1:15:24] yeah
[1:15:25] David didn't have a problem he says I
[1:15:27] will take your head off
[1:15:31] amen because I don't come to you with a
[1:15:33] sword and a shield
[1:15:35] I don't come to you with my ability but
[1:15:37] I come to you because I know the god
[1:15:40] that's in heaven
[1:15:44] let me just skip to page three
[1:15:46] I usually have one page but I've got
[1:15:48] about three this time
[1:15:50] the only reason the only reason that you
[1:15:54] can't do whatever it is that you need to
[1:15:56] do to live according to the Bible
[1:15:59] is why
[1:16:02] why
[1:16:04] is it
[1:16:09] well
[1:16:10] I've had the prophet say that he'd have
[1:16:12] harlots and prostitutes to come get
[1:16:14] their healing we're saying so
[1:16:17] huh
[1:16:19] well let me just give you a scriptural
[1:16:22] Lance how many lack of scriptural answer
[1:16:24] because you remember the epileptic child
[1:16:27] that their parents brought to the
[1:16:28] disciples and they just couldn't cast
[1:16:30] him out
[1:16:32] and remember to ask why couldn't we do
[1:16:34] it and what was the first direct answer
[1:16:37] that Jesus said
[1:16:39] he said because of your
[1:16:41] faith
[1:16:45] Hallelujah let me tell you so I believe
[1:16:47] that's where we like if we like anywhere
[1:16:50] is because of our faith in God
[1:16:54] because Bible says all things are
[1:16:57] possible
[1:16:59] anything's possible if you can believe
[1:17:07] nonetheless Bible says that with you
[1:17:09] nothing shall be
[1:17:12] impossible
[1:17:15] you can do anything if you have the
[1:17:17] Faith Lord
[1:17:20] there's nothing impossible
[1:17:23] oh Hallelujah
[1:17:25] think about it when Joshua
[1:17:28] needed more time I mean we're talking
[1:17:30] about
[1:17:32] massive things we're talking about great
[1:17:36] things like stopping the universe so to
[1:17:39] speak
[1:17:41] stopping the sun stop in the moon and
[1:17:45] we've got a little problems with
[1:17:48] taking care of our family our home and
[1:17:50] everything else
[1:17:51] huh
[1:17:53] you can't even do some of those little
[1:17:55] things
[1:17:56] they can't even treat your neighbor
[1:17:58] right
[1:17:59] you can't even treat your wife right or
[1:18:01] your husband right
[1:18:04] folks it's time to start with a small
[1:18:06] thing
[1:18:07] but it does no limit
[1:18:11] things are possible so don't give me
[1:18:13] excuses
[1:18:16] that's what the prophet said
[1:18:19] Oh my he was getting the owner he
[1:18:20] pinched on people a little bit
[1:18:22] I want to hurt you
[1:18:25] but I've told you I'm here to in the
[1:18:27] deepest of sincerity and I keep to keep
[1:18:30] from pinching you once in a while I just
[1:18:32] jump off the line somewhere else say
[1:18:34] something a little bit different
[1:18:36] staying there and make it in such a way
[1:18:38] it won't pinch too hard but I'm here to
[1:18:40] tell you something the Bible says it is
[1:18:42] wrong for a woman to cut her hair and
[1:18:43] you say you've got the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:45] cut your hair
[1:18:47] now that's just one illustration of
[1:18:49] whatever it is that you're having a
[1:18:51] problem with tonight are you with me huh
[1:18:54] may not be here but something whatever
[1:18:56] it is is contrary to the word you said
[1:18:58] oh
[1:19:01] you know okay
[1:19:04] and you can only want to go to church
[1:19:09] I don't feel like going to church you
[1:19:11] better get a different feeling in your
[1:19:13] heart
[1:19:15] isn't that right or whatever it might be
[1:19:18] wrong for it to do her hair and you say
[1:19:20] you got the Holy Ghost I wonder if you
[1:19:23] have and I don't get mad if you do it
[1:19:26] shows that you're another Mark against
[1:19:27] you
[1:19:29] why because the Bible said for a woman
[1:19:30] not to cut her hair isn't that right
[1:19:34] the Bible says it's wrong for a woman to
[1:19:36] put a garment that pertains to a man and
[1:19:37] you wear those little overalls or
[1:19:39] whatever it is you've grown women I
[1:19:41] guess a little girl or a little baby or
[1:19:43] whatever to play with the little boys
[1:19:45] and things but look when you're a grown
[1:19:47] woman 15 16 18 years old no grandma on
[1:19:50] off the road the opposits an Abomination
[1:19:52] it's not a God to wear another thing and
[1:19:54] you wear them anymore and you say you
[1:19:55] got the Holy Ghost I wonder sometimes
[1:19:57] that Holy Ghost will follow God's word
[1:20:00] to the letter and the preaching behind
[1:20:01] the pope will they got Grace enough to
[1:20:03] preach it I doubt he's got it
[1:20:08] he hit us all Tony
[1:20:11] that's right
[1:20:13] Glory now I got wrote down here but you
[1:20:15] know most people make an excuse
[1:20:18] you know for themselves and say well it
[1:20:19] was for some other age let me tell you
[1:20:22] something people got to form the
[1:20:23] godliness but they deny the power
[1:20:25] they're us
[1:20:27] when God does something he doesn't
[1:20:30] complete work
[1:20:31] how many that's what God's singing he's
[1:20:33] doing a complete work Lord
[1:20:37] keep changing me
[1:20:42] help me to go out here for better person
[1:20:43] don't want to come in
[1:20:46] let me be equipped I mean those that God
[1:20:49] equips his people
[1:20:51] but if I'm talking about Moses he
[1:20:53] completely when God sends a man to do
[1:20:54] anything he completely equips him with
[1:20:57] everything he has made of
[1:21:00] Hallelujah
[1:21:02] and when God equips a man he equips him
[1:21:05] with his own material
[1:21:07] I like that don't you it's not by our
[1:21:10] might
[1:21:11] it's not by our power but it's by his
[1:21:15] spirit says the Lord
[1:21:18] that's the way you learned it he says
[1:21:19] he's talking about amen that God that's
[1:21:21] how God equips his army is he fills them
[1:21:24] with his spirit
[1:21:26] we got all that like both here and
[1:21:28] out there that you need more of the Holy
[1:21:30] Ghost you need more Christ and a lot of
[1:21:33] these problems you wouldn't have anymore
[1:21:38] because the Holy Ghost wouldn't do it
[1:21:41] the Holy Ghost is sensitive about
[1:21:42] everything that you do
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:46] but it's only by faith I wanted to pull
[1:21:48] that out and amen because that's where
[1:21:50] the problem is is the faith level
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:56] because even
[1:21:58] that man that had that child and brought
[1:22:00] to him and so forth he says if thou
[1:22:01] can't believe all things are possible he
[1:22:03] says Lord I believe Lord help them an
[1:22:06] unbelief
[1:22:08] huh
[1:22:09] but that's what Jesus pointed to him
[1:22:11] when the disciples came up to something
[1:22:13] that they couldn't overcome it was your
[1:22:15] faith level is what the problem is
[1:22:17] amen praise the Lord
[1:22:20] Joshua 23 1-6 it talks about he says you
[1:22:23] know uh let's just go there
[1:22:27] let's just go to Joshua
[1:22:28] let's read this one
[1:22:31] be thee therefore very courageous to
[1:22:33] keep all to do that is written in the
[1:22:35] book of the law this is 23 and verse 6.
[1:22:40] that you turned on a side they're from
[1:22:42] to the right hand or to the left that ye
[1:22:44] come not among these nations
[1:22:47] these that remain among you neither make
[1:22:49] mention of the name of their gods nor
[1:22:51] cause to swear by them neither serve
[1:22:54] them nor by yourselves unto them but
[1:22:56] cleave unto the Lord your God as you
[1:22:58] have done unto this day for the Lord has
[1:23:01] driven out before you the great Nations
[1:23:04] and strong you great Nations this is a
[1:23:07] strong but as for you no man has been
[1:23:09] able to stand before you all your days
[1:23:12] how many noses that's what he told even
[1:23:14] Josh at the beginning you don't focus on
[1:23:17] God give him a night they meditate day
[1:23:19] and night he says and there's no man
[1:23:21] that'll stand in front of you
[1:23:24] Billy Paul said about his dad you know
[1:23:26] the greatest Miracle about his dad is
[1:23:28] how they can control every situation
[1:23:31] I wonder if that was for God's people
[1:23:32] for God's Prophet I wonder if that ain't
[1:23:34] for you and I
[1:23:36] tonight that if you stay in Christ and
[1:23:38] focus the way you are that there will
[1:23:40] nothing stand in your way nothing will
[1:23:43] stumble you nothing will bring you down
[1:23:48] oh
[1:23:49] I don't know about you but I believe
[1:23:51] it's for you and for me
[1:23:53] I believe it's for me
[1:23:55] amen now notice
[1:23:58] stand before you unto this day one man
[1:24:01] of you shall chase a thousand
[1:24:09] when God is with you it don't matter how
[1:24:12] many is against you
[1:24:18] how many knows that Samson is an example
[1:24:22] David's an example Moses an example
[1:24:26] if God before us
[1:24:28] who can be against us
[1:24:31] if God is for you who can be against you
[1:24:37] doesn't that make you feel good man
[1:24:39] doesn't that make you just want to jump
[1:24:40] up now a little bit
[1:24:42] when I look at these problems of
[1:24:44] good this the more I got the looking at
[1:24:45] it I realized why the prophet of God
[1:24:47] says we ought to be the happiest people
[1:24:49] on the face of the Earth
[1:24:51] you ought to be the happiest people in
[1:24:53] the world if truly you're buried in
[1:24:55] Christ
[1:24:57] you ain't got to worry in the world
[1:25:03] not even death pastors can scare you
[1:25:07] think's yours Paul said life death these
[1:25:10] presence things to come it all belongs
[1:25:11] see because Jesus paid for it on Calvary
[1:25:14] every enemy is under your feet
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:22] praise be to God
[1:25:25] that's right
[1:25:29] let's talk about this ability how many
[1:25:31] believe we when we when God's with you
[1:25:34] you're able
[1:25:37] the enabler
[1:25:41] you know it's I just got the thought of
[1:25:42] thinking about that
[1:25:44] word able and not able
[1:25:48] you know
[1:25:51] to not have an ability is to be
[1:25:54] helpless
[1:25:56] it's like to being down in a big old
[1:25:58] hole
[1:26:00] No Way Out way down there no way out at
[1:26:03] all how many knows that's the way the
[1:26:04] human race is that's the way every
[1:26:06] person that's born of a woman is you're
[1:26:08] born down in a hole No Way Out
[1:26:10] but somebody throws your rope down there
[1:26:13] right
[1:26:15] throws you a rope down there
[1:26:17] and now all of a sudden now you're what
[1:26:20] able to get out of there
[1:26:22] gives you the ability
[1:26:26] amen now you what
[1:26:29] can
[1:26:30] instead of can't
[1:26:37] can't
[1:26:38] is not really in a Christian's
[1:26:40] vocabulary is it
[1:26:43] no never use the word can't
[1:26:46] can't
[1:26:49] unless of course it's for the right
[1:26:50] reason like you can't do things that the
[1:26:53] devil wants you I can't do that I can't
[1:26:55] do that
[1:26:56] no
[1:26:58] but as far as your possibility there's
[1:27:00] no can't because why is there no can't
[1:27:03] this scripture here takes away all the
[1:27:06] can'ts
[1:27:07] nothing shall be impossible for you
[1:27:12] so don't give me no chance well I just
[1:27:14] can't not just can't I can't
[1:27:18] sure you can but there's one that can
[1:27:21] that's him
[1:27:22] when he comes in there you can
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:29] praise be to God
[1:27:33] Paul says I can do all things through
[1:27:35] Christ which strengthen me
[1:27:38] now I want to go just for a minute
[1:27:41] I'm going to talk about the devil side
[1:27:43] you can't side
[1:27:45] huh
[1:27:47] the devil's the one that is
[1:27:51] has
[1:27:52] an inability
[1:27:55] he's not able
[1:27:58] when it comes to fighting
[1:28:00] Christians or getting you
[1:28:03] he's not able
[1:28:07] he has the word he has to use the word
[1:28:10] many times I tried but I couldn't
[1:28:13] I couldn't how many times the Devils
[1:28:15] used that down through history I
[1:28:17] couldn't
[1:28:18] I failed
[1:28:20] I failed I couldn't
[1:28:25] amen
[1:28:29] over in Romans
[1:28:31] eight
[1:28:34] because the Bible says one place about
[1:28:36] the devil in his weapons he says no
[1:28:38] weapon formed against thee
[1:28:40] shall prosper
[1:28:43] so no matter what the devil throws
[1:28:45] Against The Real Son of God daughter of
[1:28:47] God that's in Christ now
[1:28:49] huh that's in Christ
[1:28:52] no weapon formed against you is able to
[1:28:55] make it can't stand can't do it
[1:28:58] Paul said it this way he was so
[1:29:00] convinced that the devil could never get
[1:29:04] to him that he wrote in Romans 8 and
[1:29:06] verse
[1:29:08] 35 who shall separate us from the love
[1:29:11] of Christ shall tribulation
[1:29:14] distress or persecution I mean that's
[1:29:16] what the devil does
[1:29:18] persecute or famine
[1:29:21] our nakedness or Peril or sword
[1:29:25] all fails right
[1:29:29] you can't
[1:29:38] for it is as it is written for thy sake
[1:29:41] we are killed all day long we are
[1:29:43] counted as sheep as the slaughter but no
[1:29:47] in all these things we are more than
[1:29:49] conquerors
[1:29:51] more than able right through him that
[1:29:54] loved us for I am persuaded that neither
[1:29:56] death nor life
[1:30:01] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:30:06] amen nor things present nor things to
[1:30:09] come nor height nor death nor any other
[1:30:13] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:30:15] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:30:18] Jesus nothing can separate us from his
[1:30:21] love
[1:30:22] amen
[1:30:25] aren't you glad for that
[1:30:28] thank you
[1:30:31] there's another scripture just comes to
[1:30:33] mind when I looked up that Abel word
[1:30:35] running it down
[1:30:36] he says all that the father has given me
[1:30:39] will come to me
[1:30:41] amen
[1:30:44] and he talks about and being in the
[1:30:46] father's hand and he says no man is able
[1:30:49] to pluck him out of my hand
[1:30:51] no man is able nothing is going to be
[1:30:55] able to pluck it out talk about ability
[1:30:58] and not ability no devil can ever pluck
[1:31:01] you out of his hand if he gets a hold of
[1:31:03] you
[1:31:04] foreign
[1:31:09] keep your seats
[1:31:11] because this applies to you look at all
[1:31:13] the times he's tried and look at where
[1:31:15] you are still today
[1:31:17] look at all the times he's tried to
[1:31:19] pluck you out of his hand
[1:31:21] you away
[1:31:27] I'm gonna say something I don't mean to
[1:31:29] pinch too hard but I'm here to tell you
[1:31:31] that I don't hardly know any weapons
[1:31:35] that the devil hasn't used against me
[1:31:39] huh many many weapons
[1:31:44] this church a lot of y'all
[1:31:46] any weapons
[1:31:48] is many weapons
[1:31:50] tried in many ways
[1:31:54] this brings me to another scripture if I
[1:31:56] can just read it
[1:32:03] 4 and 21
[1:32:06] that's not the one I'm looking for
[1:32:10] 8 35
[1:32:13] nope
[1:32:17] all right
[1:32:24] all right let me just look at this
[1:32:28] 835
[1:32:32] .
[1:32:35] here it is 14 Romans 14 and 4.
[1:32:40] who art thou that just just another
[1:32:44] man's servant
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:49] to his own Master he standeth or falleth
[1:32:53] in other words we should be very careful
[1:32:55] about judging each other
[1:32:57] you know how quick it is
[1:32:59] well he's up the devil well he ain't of
[1:33:01] God or look at what he's doing you know
[1:33:03] and all these others quickly that just
[1:33:05] condemn somebody and so forth when
[1:33:07] you're trying to be a Christian
[1:33:09] Paul says be careful who are not a judge
[1:33:12] is another man's servant to his own
[1:33:13] Master he standeth or follow up yea he
[1:33:16] shall be holding up
[1:33:18] for God is able
[1:33:20] to make him
[1:33:22] the stand
[1:33:24] amen how many knows
[1:33:25] don't try to knock somebody else down
[1:33:27] trust me if God don't hold him he's
[1:33:30] gonna fall
[1:33:31] amen but you're sure not going to be the
[1:33:34] one that causes him to fall or makes him
[1:33:36] fall because God is able to hold him up
[1:33:40] but if the devil wouldn't he like to do
[1:33:42] that to every one of us he wants every
[1:33:44] one of us to fall
[1:33:46] amen sure he does
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:54] First Timothy 1 and 12 he says unto him
[1:33:56] that is able to keep that which I have
[1:33:58] committed unto him against that day is
[1:34:01] that right
[1:34:10] all right I want to do another little
[1:34:12] series before I bring it to a close
[1:34:14] Ephesians 6.
[1:34:18] ability let's talk about ability
[1:34:22] because that's what we're talking about
[1:34:24] when we're talking about enabling
[1:34:27] to be able
[1:34:29] ability
[1:34:32] very familiar scriptures but I was
[1:34:34] surprised at how many times he talks
[1:34:36] about it Paul in Ephesians 6
[1:34:39] and verse 10 finally my brethren
[1:34:42] amen that's what I want to double shout
[1:34:45] out to us tonight everyone listening
[1:34:47] here at the end time
[1:34:49] in this horrible age that we're living
[1:34:51] in May this apply to every one of us
[1:34:53] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:34:56] Lord and in the power of His might put
[1:35:00] on the whole armor of God that ye may be
[1:35:04] able
[1:35:06] to stand
[1:35:08] amen
[1:35:09] Against The Wiles of the devil
[1:35:17] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:35:19] blood but against principalities against
[1:35:21] Powers I like what brother Phil brought
[1:35:23] to you tonight if you can stop him right
[1:35:25] here when he comes into your mind you'll
[1:35:28] you've stopped him
[1:35:29] don't never let him come in here and
[1:35:31] then drop down in here
[1:35:33] because James talk about when Temptation
[1:35:35] comes in you know and when it has
[1:35:37] conceived it brings forth sin it's got
[1:35:39] to be conceived first it has to be
[1:35:41] accepted you've got to think about it
[1:35:42] amen
[1:35:44] against the rulers of Darkness of this
[1:35:46] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:35:48] high places War for take unto you the
[1:35:51] whole armor of God that ye may be able
[1:35:56] to withstand
[1:35:59] how many needs ability tonight see God
[1:36:01] help me I need ability
[1:36:03] I don't need excuses I need ability
[1:36:07] to stand in the Evil Dead and having not
[1:36:10] all
[1:36:11] to stand stand therefore having your
[1:36:15] loins gird about with truth and having
[1:36:17] on the breastplate of righteousness and
[1:36:19] your feet shot with the preparation of
[1:36:21] the gospel of peace and above all taking
[1:36:24] the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall
[1:36:29] be able
[1:36:30] I like that all these shall be able I
[1:36:34] like that
[1:36:35] you shall be able to quench all the
[1:36:38] fiery darts of the wicked
[1:36:41] praise be to God and take the helmet of
[1:36:43] salvation the sword of the spirit which
[1:36:45] is the word of God
[1:36:48] praying always with all prayer and
[1:36:50] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:36:52] guarantee with all perseverance
[1:36:54] and supplication for All Saints
[1:36:59] amen
[1:37:11] wow
[1:37:12] Lord increase my faith
[1:37:16] that's the only reason
[1:37:18] that you're not able
[1:37:22] if you don't have the faith
[1:37:24] if you don't believe
[1:37:25] the only reason
[1:37:27] amen
[1:37:29] all right let's go to one more scripture
[1:37:31] here
[1:37:33] in Jude
[1:37:40] I like this
[1:37:43] thank you
[1:37:50] he says verse 24 now unto him that is
[1:37:55] able
[1:37:56] remember one place he says you know he
[1:37:59] that hath begun a good work
[1:38:01] he's also able to perform it
[1:38:05] it's not about you performing it it's
[1:38:07] about him performing it in and through
[1:38:09] you isn't that a message we've heard
[1:38:12] much
[1:38:13] but yet
[1:38:14] now notice that is able to keep you from
[1:38:19] falling and to present you faultless
[1:38:22] before the presence of his glory with
[1:38:25] exceeding Joy
[1:38:28] amen
[1:38:30] to him that is able to keep you from
[1:38:32] falling I mean those that's all by the
[1:38:34] Holy Spirit
[1:38:35] it's all just the Holy Spirit
[1:38:38] with God and with the holy spirit all
[1:38:41] things are possible With God all things
[1:38:44] are possible now like what
[1:38:47] he says you know he says when God equips
[1:38:50] a person he equips his that person with
[1:38:53] his material I believe his material is
[1:38:56] his spirit
[1:38:58] amen
[1:39:00] he is able
[1:39:03] Abraham said you know he uh staggered
[1:39:05] not at the promise of God through I
[1:39:06] believe was but was strong through you
[1:39:10] know believing that he who had promised
[1:39:12] that was able to perform it
[1:39:16] I mean I believe we're to rely on God to
[1:39:18] perform it
[1:39:19] in your life my life God is doing a work
[1:39:27] amen
[1:39:29] hey well I just don't have no joy in my
[1:39:32] life but what was wrong with you amen
[1:39:34] you can have toy you can have fullness
[1:39:35] of joy
[1:39:37] you're gonna have peace that passes
[1:39:38] understanding
[1:39:40] unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:39:43] amen
[1:39:44] but I also thought about this whether
[1:39:46] one thing better than sisters and that
[1:39:48] is that we got to continue
[1:39:50] to focus more on the Lord
[1:39:52] you still have too much focus on the
[1:39:53] things of this world
[1:39:55] I mean and that's why we're weak in
[1:39:57] faith a lot of times
[1:39:58] our prayer life lacks our fellowship not
[1:40:01] love how the holy spirit's been speaking
[1:40:03] to us about our fellowship Amen brother
[1:40:05] Tommy even is talking about you know
[1:40:07] when he come first stop talking about
[1:40:09] God wants fellowship with us
[1:40:11] he wants to Fellowship
[1:40:14] what a fellowship
[1:40:17] what a joy divine
[1:40:19] leaning on the Everlasting Arms
[1:40:23] oh my praise be to God musicians if
[1:40:26] you'll come stand with me tonight
[1:40:30] I had to serve a god that is able
[1:40:33] to have a holy spirit in you that is
[1:40:35] able
[1:40:37] amen with Joshua with stopping the son
[1:40:39] Jesus says if thou can't believe you'll
[1:40:42] say to this mountain be moved into
[1:40:44] deceived thou doubts not it'll be done
[1:40:48] you just get rid of all the doubt Lord
[1:40:50] get rid of the doubt
[1:40:52] I'm wondering how many tonight would say
[1:40:54] you know I've still got too much doubt
[1:40:55] too many things that caused me to doubt
[1:40:57] Lord take that away and give me more
[1:40:59] Faith Lord to believe
[1:41:01] amen Lord Jesus do you see all the hands
[1:41:03] all over the building tonight Lord my
[1:41:05] heart's desires God help me father that
[1:41:07] my my
[1:41:09] affections would be more on the things
[1:41:11] above and not so much on the things
[1:41:13] beneath because when we have the Holy
[1:41:15] Spirit that's where our focus is more
[1:41:18] Lord but we're living in laodicea and we
[1:41:21] have all these cares sometimes these
[1:41:23] cares drowned out the Holy Spirit it
[1:41:25] drowns out the faith that we need to
[1:41:27] live above some of these Hang-Ups and
[1:41:31] these these uh things that the prophet
[1:41:33] of God talked about these little things
[1:41:34] that hang on to us and Lord we ask God
[1:41:37] did you give us more faith than that law
[1:41:39] draw us closer to you Lord and build our
[1:41:41] faith Lord to believe that all things
[1:41:43] are possible give us the ability
[1:41:44] overcome Lord all of our habits and all
[1:41:47] the things that shouldn't be there Lord
[1:41:48] for we know that the Holy Spirit wants
[1:41:51] to total line as your Prophet said you
[1:41:53] set the mark and we tow it
[1:41:55] we come up
[1:41:56] to it Lord Jesus that's what we want
[1:41:59] father we want to be pleasing to you in
[1:42:01] everything we do father
[1:42:02] amen we ask these blessings and favors
