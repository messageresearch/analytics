[28:03] good morning everyone
[28:05] let's stand
[28:10] Brother Brad see not here
[28:13] brother Brian would you start off the
[28:16] sermon in prayer
[28:21] foreign
[28:25] way more control
[28:58] amen children can be dismissed at Sunday
[29:01] school
[29:03] oh
[29:06] let's open our Bibles and turn to
[29:09] Psalms 116.
[29:29] I love the Lord because he hath heard my
[29:32] voice and my suffocations
[29:35] foreign
[29:49] trouble in sorrow
[29:57] gracious is the Lord and righteous yea
[30:01] our God is merciful
[30:10] return unto thy rest O my soul for the
[30:14] Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee
[30:25] I will walk before the Lord in the land
[30:28] of the living
[30:35] I said in my haste all men are liars
[30:45] I will take the cup of Salvation and
[30:48] call upon the name of the Lord
[30:51] obviously
[30:57] crashes in the sight of the Lord is the
[30:59] death of his Saints
[31:12] and we'll call upon the name of the Lord
[31:23] this one together in the courts of the
[31:26] Lord's House in the midst of the
[31:28] Jerusalem praise ye the Lord
[31:32] amen
[31:34] everyone could be seated
[31:36] brother Daniel
[31:45] good morning everyone
[31:49] amen if uh turn with me if you will to
[31:53] First Samuel 16 and verse 7.
[32:13] foreign
[32:27] said unto Samuel look not on his
[32:31] countenance or on the height of his
[32:33] stats because I have refused him for for
[32:36] the Lord seeth not as man see it for man
[32:41] looketh on the outward appearance but
[32:43] the Lord
[32:44] looketh on the heart
[32:48] amen what what I want to speak on this
[32:50] morning is
[32:53] character that there the Lord looks on
[32:56] the heart rather than looking on on the
[32:58] outward apparent see
[33:00] um God chose David not because he he not
[33:05] because he was the the greatest of them
[33:07] and you would think if you were picking
[33:10] one of them you would pick the strongest
[33:12] and which one and would be the most
[33:15] suitable for a king a warrior someone
[33:17] that looks strong and
[33:21] and we would look on the outside as as
[33:23] human beings that's how we are we look
[33:25] at people uh as in in like how they look
[33:30] how strong they are if I was in picking
[33:32] the the one and to become king and like
[33:36] Samuel was
[33:38] picking picking who who was it that was
[33:41] going to be
[33:42] even next King it was a very important
[33:44] thing that he he couldn't rely on on his
[33:46] own
[33:48] own abilities to find someone here to
[33:52] um hear what what God would want and
[33:55] what him the one who got would uh choose
[33:59] instead of what he would think would be
[34:01] the best
[34:03] now uh brother Brandon says it like this
[34:07] um he says now Christian friends we're
[34:10] all in eternity being bound people every
[34:13] one of us
[34:14] here has got to meet God and face God
[34:16] someday and we're going to give an
[34:19] account for the Deeds that's done in our
[34:21] lives now if I told you I was a gangster
[34:24] and had the the spirit of John Dillinger
[34:27] or was upon me well you'd you'd expect
[34:30] me to have guns and be that kind of a
[34:34] character because his Spirit what was on
[34:37] me if I told you I had the spirit of an
[34:39] artist some great famous artist you'd
[34:41] expect me to be able to catch the scene
[34:44] of the Waves when I was tipping of the
[34:47] of the sunset when it was as Tiffany of
[34:51] the sunset and almost bring it out out
[34:53] in life's color if I had the spirit of
[34:56] an artist in me I would do the work of
[34:58] an artist and if we had the spirit of
[35:01] Christ when we do the works of Christ in
[35:04] the spirit that was upon him he said a
[35:07] little while in the world seeth me no
[35:09] more yet you'll see me for I'll be with
[35:12] you even in you to the end of the age
[35:16] amen Romans 5 and verse 3 3 is a to
[35:21] three to five it says and not only any
[35:24] so but but we glory and tribulation is
[35:27] also knowing that tribulation worketh
[35:30] patience and patience experience and
[35:32] experience hope and hope maketh not a
[35:35] shame because the love of God is shed
[35:37] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[35:40] which is given unto us
[35:42] amen character cannot be developed in
[35:46] ease in in quiet only through experience
[35:51] of trial and suffering can this will be
[35:53] strength and vision cleared ambition
[35:56] inspired and success achieved this is a
[35:58] quote
[36:00] by um
[36:02] someone named uh Helen Keller I'm not
[36:05] sure who that is but but it's it it's
[36:07] it's true it's it's true that's why God
[36:11] puts us through new trials and
[36:13] tribulations when we don't feel like we
[36:15] understand what and what's going on like
[36:17] why we're going through this and then
[36:19] later on as you age you realize that was
[36:21] to build your character and who you are
[36:23] as a person because that's way more
[36:24] important than than
[36:27] it's it's way more important than than
[36:29] how
[36:30] um great great of a a uh person and
[36:34] people see see you to be but if you're
[36:36] if behind the scenes you're you're truly
[36:39] a dark person and and even if if you're
[36:42] outward
[36:44] um person that people see on the outside
[36:46] your reputation is good but then and
[36:49] what when nobody's looking that's who
[36:52] you really are when when nobody's ACS
[36:55] what you're doing and nobody sees what
[36:57] kind of a person you are behind the
[36:59] scenes that's who who you really are
[37:01] because you can put on on a different
[37:03] person you can put on a different
[37:05] personality while you're away from
[37:07] people I've seen this so many times when
[37:10] when all of a sudden you become someone
[37:12] else when you're talking to someone that
[37:14] it really matters how how you look to
[37:16] them and you really change it seem to
[37:18] change as a person and and all of a
[37:20] sudden you're like
[37:22] yeah you're you're such a great person
[37:24] all of a sudden everybody thinks highly
[37:26] of you but then when you go back to
[37:28] actually your home it's it's like
[37:31] you you know no longer that person
[37:33] anymore
[37:35] and and so it says here that this is
[37:38] another quote watch your thoughts for
[37:40] they become words watch your words for
[37:43] they become actions watch your actions
[37:46] for they become habits watch your habits
[37:48] before they become character watch your
[37:51] character for it becomes your destiny
[37:56] amen a character is the foundation of a
[37:59] person's life and it is built on the
[38:02] choices we make the Bible tells us that
[38:04] our character is shaped by our actions
[38:07] and our attitudes we are called to be
[38:10] people of Integrity honesty and
[38:12] compassion we are to love our neighbors
[38:15] as ourselves to be kind and patient to
[38:17] seek Justice and mercy our character is
[38:21] not just about what we do but who we are
[38:24] it is a reflection of our heart and our
[38:27] relationship with God as proverbs 4 23
[38:31] says
[38:33] it says keep thy heart with all
[38:36] diligence for out of it are the issues
[38:39] of life our character is something that
[38:42] we must intentionally cultivate through
[38:45] prayer reading the word of God and
[38:47] putting into practice what we
[38:50] after we become more like Christ and we
[38:52] are able
[38:54] a life that is pleasing to God and
[38:57] beneficial to others
[39:02] amen it is it is so important who we are
[39:05] as as Believers not just who we we
[39:08] appear to others not just as what what
[39:11] other people see on us because that's
[39:12] our reputation there's a difference
[39:14] between simply your reputation and your
[39:16] character because people can think
[39:18] highly of you
[39:20] and think you're such a great person
[39:22] yeah and but but behind the scenes you
[39:26] could have a dark heart and and be far
[39:29] from God be far from from who you appear
[39:32] to be to others
[39:34] so so it's very important and that the
[39:38] most important thing is to have the
[39:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[39:41] that'll bring about your character
[39:42] that'll bring about uh God and that'll
[39:46] bring God on the scene in your heart to
[39:49] change your life to make you a better
[39:51] person not just not not just this you
[39:55] decided I'm gonna be this great person
[39:57] and you can and try to do that what by
[40:00] works but you'll only go so far but with
[40:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:04] you'll be able to become I'm the person
[40:07] that God has called you to be
[40:09] a to the fullness uh the fullness of a
[40:12] statue of a man that's the only way
[40:13] you'll get get to that place is with the
[40:16] baptism the Holy Ghost and so so even
[40:19] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost once
[40:22] you receive the weapons of the Holy
[40:23] Ghost citizen finish there got it and
[40:25] it's just beginning to work God is just
[40:27] us beginning in the work and and so so
[40:30] he has come to to build build you up as
[40:34] a person build you up as a Christian and
[40:37] so new Believers that have just been
[40:39] born again
[40:40] they're they're not not uh to the to
[40:44] they can they will end up making tons of
[40:47] mistakes even after the baptism Holy
[40:49] Ghost
[40:50] because
[40:52] of our own flesh and and you know it's
[40:54] it's still an onward battle that we we
[40:56] go through each and every day and so so
[40:59] God oh
[41:01] build us up and bring us through those
[41:03] trials and tribulations and bring about
[41:05] our character and build our character
[41:07] and and so so that we might be able to
[41:10] be in his perfect will because that that
[41:12] is God's desire for each and every one
[41:14] of us this morning is for for us to be
[41:17] in in his perfect will tell to have the
[41:20] character of Christ that's why are we we
[41:23] are to follow Christ in everything we do
[41:25] and follow this word and stay with it

[54:01] [Music]
[54:08] [Music]
[54:14] now aren't you thankful for that this
[54:16] morning and you know I I was praying the
[54:19] other morning I got to thinking and then
[54:21] the song and I thought about it again
[54:23] and I thought you know Lord
[54:27] if you've never really been sick you
[54:28] don't really know how you'll react to
[54:31] things and
[54:32] and I I begin to Marvel I begin to think
[54:35] about sister Sherry
[54:37] and every time I ask her how you doing
[54:39] she said I'm doing really good
[54:41] and she said I know that it's all in
[54:44] God's hands this morning
[54:46] and I thought you know Lord
[54:48] help help me this morning because I'll
[54:51] tell you sometimes when I don't feel
[54:53] very good I kind of get wimpy
[54:55] and I just and sometimes I just don't
[54:57] have the faith that I need
[54:59] but I thought Lord give me that faith
[55:02] and then I think what our Prophet said
[55:03] he said when he would eat that food and
[55:06] it would come back up and
[55:08] he'd eat it again and I thought boy that
[55:10] must have been really rough
[55:12] but he kept on confessing that God had
[55:15] healed him
[55:16] and somebody said well brother Bill
[55:18] you're not he said yes I am healed
[55:21] by his stripes I'm Healed this morning
[55:23] you know I I begin to think of all that
[55:26] and I thought Lord help us all to have
[55:28] that faith
[55:30] because brother Branham come as an
[55:32] example to us to put our trust in God
[55:35] that he had seen work and he knew he was
[55:38] able to do it
[55:39] and you know what he always taught us
[55:41] what was his theme song
[55:43] only believe some things are possible no
[55:47] he said all things are possible we
[55:50] serve an on-time God this morning and
[55:53] and we believe that he's a Healer this
[55:55] morning but the Daniel and brother
[55:57] Michael Jonathan Carson and this morning
[55:59] and we have several prayer requests but
[56:02] the Brad's not here uh brother Weston

[56:06] him as he's traveled on the road and
[56:08] remember all those that are gone to the
[56:11] meetings that'll be coming home and just
[56:13] pray that God will give them traveling
[56:14] mercy and
[56:15] also uh for the Micah buyers running a
[56:19] fever this morning I want to remember
[56:21] the Micah in prayer this morning that
[56:23] God would just touch his body and our
[56:25] shut-in sister Peggy and sister parish
[56:27] and sister Angie the different ones and
[56:29] also my brother-in-law we've been

[56:34] he they've got him out of his induced
[56:36] coma and he went to him yesterday he's

[56:43] Jan and Mom are going to go uh up there
[56:46] by St Louis and see him in the hospital
[56:48] and just pray that we can be a blessing
[56:51] to them and you know they just they're
[56:53] just down you know how the enemy likes
[56:55] to beat us up but you know we just pray
[56:58] that God will just help him this morning
[56:59] and you know I I say I say this and you
[57:04] know because I've been I've I once had
[57:07] to recognize what God had done for me
[57:08] just pray that the Lord will speak to
[57:10] his heart spiritually more than his
[57:12] health because if he if he doesn't if he
[57:15] doesn't save him it's not going to do
[57:16] it's heal him but he needs the Lord in
[57:19] all his heart so remember the Tim his
[57:22] family and he just needs a touch from
[57:24] the Lord this morning and I know God
[57:25] Babel
[57:27] if he can last raise you know have
[57:30] Lazarus raised from the grave after
[57:32] being dead four days I'm sure a stroke
[57:34] is no big deal to him this morning amen

[57:38] might let it be known by the uplifting
[57:40] hand and rashford the Josh if he'd stand

[1:10:07] from what we spoke on I think it was
[1:10:10] Wednesday I believe it was amen and
[1:10:12] talking about the weapons of our Warfare
[1:10:14] so we're going to talk about the weapons
[1:10:15] of our Warfare part two amen part two in
[1:10:20] will Kyle or title this builds
[1:10:23] to withstand built to withstand is that
[1:10:27] all right hey man and so I do have some
[1:10:30] statements I think that I don't remember
[1:10:32] that I don't remember hearing or perhaps
[1:10:35] even making making myself this morning
[1:10:38] but amen I feel like the Lord's given me
[1:10:41] something good this morning I trust
[1:10:42] it'll be good for you amen amen
[1:10:47] praise the Lord
[1:10:49] let's turn our Bibles into the book of
[1:10:52] Ephesians if you will book of Ephesians
[1:10:59] chapter 6.
[1:11:03] there is a lot of things that we are a
[1:11:06] type of Amen like the Bride of Jesus
[1:11:08] Christ the Church of the Living God
[1:11:09] where children of God you know but in
[1:11:13] this instance it puts us in the category
[1:11:15] of soldiers isn't that right
[1:11:18] soldiers amen finally Brethren verse 10
[1:11:22] chapter 6 of Ephesians
[1:11:24] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:11:26] Lord and in the power of His might put
[1:11:27] on the whole armor of God that you may
[1:11:30] be able
[1:11:32] to stand against amen
[1:11:36] isn't that right how many believes
[1:11:37] there's some things we have to stand
[1:11:39] against there's a lot of things that
[1:11:42] you're going to have to stand against
[1:11:44] The Wiles of the devil one place I
[1:11:47] believe the Bible says that when Satan
[1:11:49] comes in like a flood isn't that right
[1:11:51] God will set up a standard against it so
[1:11:54] it's not just some Wilds but it's a
[1:11:56] flood and you and I are certainly seeing
[1:11:58] that flood for we wrestle not against
[1:12:01] flesh and blood but against
[1:12:02] principalities and against Powers
[1:12:04] against the rulers of Darkness of this
[1:12:07] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:12:10] high places amen wherefore take unto you
[1:12:13] the whole armor of God that ye may be
[1:12:15] able to withstand in the evil day and
[1:12:19] having done all to stand or can we say
[1:12:22] to withstand withstand therefore amen
[1:12:25] amen
[1:12:27] having your loins go to Bow is truth and
[1:12:29] having on the breastplate of
[1:12:31] righteousness and having your feet shot
[1:12:32] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:12:34] peace
[1:12:35] above all taking the shield of Faith
[1:12:37] where would you work with he shall be
[1:12:39] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:12:41] the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:12:43] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:12:45] which is the word of God praying always
[1:12:48] with all prayer and supplication in the
[1:12:50] spirit watching there with all
[1:12:52] perseverance and supplications to make
[1:12:55] known The Mystery of the gospel for
[1:12:57] which I am a Ambassador in bonds that
[1:13:01] there and I may speak boldly as I ought
[1:13:03] to speak may God add His blessings to
[1:13:05] the reading and the words you can be
[1:13:07] seated this morning praise the Lord
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:12] amen so one first thing I want to say is
[1:13:17] that
[1:13:19] we are of course in a contest how many
[1:13:22] believe that
[1:13:24] I believe Alabama says the contest he
[1:13:26] preached a message called the contest
[1:13:28] between God and Satan and of course you
[1:13:30] and I are in that contest or could we
[1:13:32] say in this battle or in this fight
[1:13:35] amen everybody that's born in in this
[1:13:39] world is is forced I'm going to say
[1:13:42] Force into a contest
[1:13:45] you're forced to fight
[1:13:47] you don't have a choice
[1:13:50] amen you really don't because and I'll
[1:13:52] say this that you either kill him or
[1:13:55] he'll kill you
[1:13:57] that's how it is
[1:13:59] you're either going to have to get a
[1:14:00] better hymn or he will get the better of
[1:14:02] you amen and so that's where we're at
[1:14:07] praise the Lord
[1:14:09] he either destroy him or he'll destroy
[1:14:13] you
[1:14:14] man they're you're in the battle how
[1:14:15] many believes were in the battle the
[1:14:17] greatest battle that ever was fought
[1:14:19] amen a lot of my quotes of course this
[1:14:21] morning will come from a message called
[1:14:23] the greatest battle that was ever fought
[1:14:25] and so we meant we're gonna uh we
[1:14:28] touched a lot on that and I and I
[1:14:31] looked and seen the quote where brother
[1:14:33] Brandon was really talking about that
[1:14:35] how that and he
[1:14:37] he said if the devil can get into any
[1:14:39] one of those channels he can get in
[1:14:41] there he'll have you amen and we have to
[1:14:44] guard and keep him out of there amen and
[1:14:47] keep the guarded by the holy spirit amen
[1:14:50] because if you keep keep it guarded by
[1:14:54] this Holy Spirit and you keep those in
[1:14:56] check if it's amazing and I'll make my
[1:14:58] first comment about some of the things
[1:15:00] that I've heard and and so forth because
[1:15:02] uh you know some of the brothers are the
[1:15:04] things that's been said I mean he
[1:15:06] started out with the very very same
[1:15:08] thing brother brother Dwayne Lawson did
[1:15:10] and I don't know if you all stream that
[1:15:12] or not but I really wanted to just play
[1:15:13] that this morning but
[1:15:19] but we live by faith we look at the
[1:15:21] Unseen not the scene and how did this
[1:15:24] here the five senses and all of that of
[1:15:26] course he went into area that I had
[1:15:27] never even thought about going and we
[1:15:29] just had a really really good time amen
[1:15:32] but you know I think it was Caleb and my
[1:15:34] and Tommy also they they uh have been
[1:15:37] talking just talking to me and of course
[1:15:39] each other and they've been streaming a
[1:15:41] lot of preachers I have not streamed
[1:15:42] very many preachers at all here lately I
[1:15:44] have a little bit more than I used to
[1:15:46] but amen I I usually it is very good but
[1:15:50] you know one thing they said and I've
[1:15:52] seen when I was over there and that is
[1:15:53] that you know it's the same Holy Spirit
[1:15:56] same Holy Spirit and even they said it's
[1:15:58] amazing how the thieving the things that
[1:16:00] I've been preaching and now that think
[1:16:02] they've been talking about things
[1:16:03] they've heard others and how did it's
[1:16:05] the same holy spirit amen and it shows
[1:16:08] that God is doing
[1:16:12] is doing something something's going on
[1:16:15] Amen how many know that you and I want
[1:16:18] to be a part of that what just going on
