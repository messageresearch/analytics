[Music] right so so uh you fourth of july for everyone amen praise the lord celebrating independence day amen so let's stand this morning brother irvin would you open up service and prayer for us this morning yes jesus yes father yes jesus bless the lord amen let's be dismissed for sunday school this morning amen and then we'll read the scriptures i think that's how we do it right all right let's turn our bibles this morning to psalms 147 and we'll go to the first 11 verses praise ye the lord for he for it is good to sing praises unto our god for it is pleasant and praise is calmly he healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds great is our god and of great power his understanding is infinite sing unto the lord with thanksgiving sing praise unto the harp upon the harp unto our god he giveth to the beast his food and the young ravens which cry everybody on 11 the lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him and those that hope in his mercy i'll be cd good morning brothers and sisters like my brother thomas was saying happy fourth of july you know it's a funny thing about our country in the world we live in i could mention some places that most young men and women wouldn't even know where they're at in the world today but i was just thinking you know today's july 4th but on july 4th 1863 the two opposing forces were recovering from thousands of men given their lives that after faith in you know july 31 the battle of gettysburg was over and on july 4th two opposing forces were withdrawn from each other with thousands of dead and wounded men you know and sometimes people forget how life is i was just thinking this morning let me just when i when i look at you or you look at me you don't see you don't really see me or and i really don't see you there's only one entity god himself is the only one when he looks at you or looks at me he actually sees the real you whether it female or male he sees the real you nothing and you can't matter nothing i can do can manufacture that that's something god does for us i know i say that a lot i can't say it enough but if you would go with me to second corinthians the 13th chapter and you know i was just thinking about that you i can mention some places and i don't know if they don't they choose not to teach our country's history the way it should be taught anymore but you know i could mention numerous places that people wouldn't even know anymore because they just don't teach it i don't they you just think of i don't know eight you take a simple year like 1776 most people wouldn't know that the first four years of the revolutionary war were a dark time for the colonists they didn't really have any real significant victories i mean they had little battles they won but it was a struggle the first three to four years of the war it almost looked like it was over you know and then they had some victories and then it accelerated and they won you know you wouldn't know that today they don't teach that kind of stuff to the people you know it was it was a real dark hour back then in the turn turn of the century back then it was just god's grace that there is the united states of america this morning and you sit in a free country even though you can choose to believe the way you want to believe you can choose to go where you want to go you know i've been all over the world but the united states is one of the few countries that you can go 1500 miles and not have a passport or have papers to go from one area to the other area that's a blessing you people take for granted um but bringing it back this uh chapter and second corinthians the 13th chapter here this kind of speaks for today where we're at and uh paul had this to say this is the third time i'm coming to you in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established and i've told you before and foretell you foretold you as if i were president second time being absent now i write to them which herefore have sinned and to all others i if i come again i will not spare so he's speaking to the churches in corinthian you know telling them that he's sending letters to bring them back to the truth but then he goes on it's like since you seek the proof of christ speaking in me which is to you word is not weak but is mighty in you for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god towards you and this is really important scripture for this fifth one here for the age that we live in you know uh i can't examine you your pastor can you gotta examine yourself and this is what paul examined yourself whether you be in the faith prove your own self know you not your own selves that jesus christ is in you except you be reprobate so paul's given two contrasts here you've got to examine yourself you've got to know where you're where you're at in the in the age that you're in right now this morning and he's saying to examine yourselves and only you know if jesus christ is living and abiding in your heart that's what i was saying earlier i can look at you all i see is the outward presentation that i that i live with every day but god really knows you on the inside he knows inside your heart he knows inside your mind and the problem with some people god isn't in their heart he's in their mind and it never gets down to the heart and those kind of people are all over the plate using a baseball ism there they're just all over the place they don't consistently walk that line in their lives where they're the same person i said that last week i said the week before but i can't say are you the same person when i see you here are you the same person when you're at work are you the same person when you're playing whatever you're doing are you still the same person that's the same god abiding you at work that abides in you that's sitting here this morning in this church only you know that i i don't know that and he goes on to say examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know you're not your own self that in jesus christ is in you except you be reprobates and i know there's no reprobates here this morning but i trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates now i pray you to god you do not know evil that you should appear or prove or prove excuse me but that you should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates so he's saying people might look at you as a reprobate but you know who you are and everything we do we do honestly for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth for we are glad when we are weak we ye are strong this also we excuse me i'm not reading these things right fear or glad when we are we you are strong and and this also we wish that even your perfection therefore i write these things being absent unless being present i should use your sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction so paul saying here that in and what was read in the uh in the psalms it's in god doesn't use the strength of the horse he doesn't use the strength of man he doesn't use the strength of a government he uses weakness just simple weakness people submitting to him and to the spirit of christ that's what god uses and he goes on to say therefore i write these things being absent least being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction finally brethren farewell be perfect be of one comfort and be of one mind live in peace and with god of love and peace shall be with you you know uh god is asking us paul is asking us to be perfect can you be perfect in yourself no the only way you can be perfect is in god's word this morning and let me jump over here since i have a thompson chain reference bible here and i probably didn't write down what i should have wrote down let me see if i can find it again this morning uh if you have a thompson chain reference you can turn turn the page 15 20. you know we have to examine ourselves every day every morning every hour you know brother branham said you shouldn't go to bed at night unless you need to write whatever that is in your heart or in your life and uh lamentations the third chapter and the 40 it says let us search and try our ways and return again to the lord and it goes back to what paul was saying in the 13th chapter of second corinthians you got to examine yourself are you the same person you were 40 years ago like i said last sunday are you a different person the desires that you had in your heart 10 years ago five are they the same desires that you have in your heart this morning and then matthew 7 which i read a lot too it um val hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and thou shalt seek clearly to cast out more out of thy brother's iron and that's a perfect example of the world we live in everyone sees everyone else's faults you know they always look at everyone else they always condemn everyone else they never lift anyone else up that's the age we're in very rarely do you have a kind of person that looks deep inside himself before he even tries to help someone else you know what he's saying here is before you see something wrong with someone else you really got to examine yourself are you doing are you doing the same thing yourself and you're about to tell someone else to stop doing something you're doing yourself and i like i said again when i look at you i can't see the real you god sees the real you and it's the same with me is god in this heart of mind is he in this life of mine showing me who i really am and it takes a lot of prayer takes a lot of humility a lot of self seeking before the lord just have god show you who you really are and what you are and he goes on to say here in in corinthians first corinthians 11 and 28 but let amen and this is part of the communion service it says but let a man examine yourself so let him eat of the bread and drink of that cup and paul goes talks in that chapter how every man should examine himself and see if he's in the faith and then second i just read second corinthians 13 if let me see if i can jump here if you'll jump with me to matthew the seventh chapter yeah i'm one of those kind of people to get in there everything i do has to be fast i'm not one of those guys that draws back for something and takes his time if anyone knows me you know that about me i'm i'm not one of those kind of people uh and it goes to what i was reading and this is what jesus had to say you know as i i was thinking the world we live in they they like to take what christ said one place and they forget about what he said somewhere else so they twisted so much they make him say things he didn't say or do things that he didn't do but this is simply what he said here judge not and you be not judged for with the judgment you judge you shall be judged and with the measure you might it shall be measured to you again and i've read this one already and that why beholdest thou the mode in my brother's eye consider not the being in their own eyes and like i said you have to have a life before the lord where he can show you who you really are before you can before you can have help anyone else you've got to help yourself to get into that position and how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of an eye behold the beam that it is in their own eye thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of their own eye and thou shalt see clearly to cast a moat out of that brother's eye you know that's the way life is we see issues in other people that we think are so big uh but maybe in god's eyes it's not a big issue for them you might have an issue that god might think is even bigger than their issue like i said that's what people are they they don't they don't want to see the tr see themselves for who they really are and he goes on he goes on jesus says here give not that which is holy on the dogs neither cast your pearls before swine at least they trample under their feet and turn again around you ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asks receive it and he that seeketh find that to him that knock it it should be open and i would just end with that scripture this morning are you knocking enough are you seeking enough are you desiring enough to see god do something for you in your life you know we all have plateaus in our life we all have valleys we all have ups and downs you shouldn't be in the down your whole life you should be living in a valley you should have some victories i'm not i'm not laughing at your i have my rises and my falls i'm just saying your life shouldn't be a deadline you shouldn't have a you should like a dead person you shouldn't have a single line going one direction your life should have ups and downs you should have great moments you might have some slow moments but everybody has to have that time in their lives where god raises you up and lifts you down you know we all have to move forward you know that's the one thing about life you have to keep going forward in life and you have to keep desiring to see god do something for you in life that's greater than the day before you have to count on his grace and his mercy and everything that you say and do brother david just before brother david lee's songs i mean we want to try to shoot for next weekend uh saturday morning maybe get uh our pa our driveway sealed so the brian already purchased the sealer from uh lowe's so it's gonna be about 95 gallon buckets i mean that we got to try to take a squeegee and a broom and we're going to put it on pretty heavy this time i mean we're getting pretty much the best material i think that you can get it's supposed to have a 10-year durability on it so it's going to be good but friday night if anybody has time to come we're going to try to blow clean everything off this coming friday night providing we don't have rain in the forecast if rain comes in the forecast or something then it will have to be changed another time but all of our young men josh all of us and then if we could get all the help we can it'll make it go pretty good amen and so and then saturday morning is when we want to put a sealer down and we'll plan on starting between 7 and 7 30 in the morning i told nine o'clock but some of them said boy let's start earlier than that it's hot at nine so we'll try about 7 7 30 to get started uh to do that next next weekend lord willing okay amen love him with all your heart this morning amen let's stand this morning if we could and amen aren't you thankful for his grace and mercy today and amen let's sing that little song when i'm tossed on live see you this morning amen one more valley when i'm tossed on my scene not [Music] [Music] seems to available shout there be a brighter day don't allow the storms to hide sweet heaven here cause you've got one more valley one more and you've got one more trial one lord [Music] and one more curve in my stroke maybe one more miles ago oh you can lay down your heavy low when you get home oh don't let satan [Music] learn to smile through your fears just be faithful all the way it'll be worth it all someday because it's all gonna be over after a while [Music] and you've got one more trial one more oh you can lay down your heavy load [Music] and you've got one more [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh you can lay down your heavy load when you get home hey man you love him with all of your heart you may be seated this morning and god bless each and every one it's good to see you we have several out this morning and we just appreciate those that are here and those that are watching this morning are shut-ins brother sister parrish and sister peggy smith and the different ones so god bless you this morning and i thought my what a beautiful day and as brother brian talked about the 4th of july and we take we take so much for granted in our lives being americans because we are truly a blessed people and then on the spiritual side to have the message come in our language that god blessed us with in this hour to not have to go through an interpreter and have everything that our access that we have need of and you know when i was growing up it was real to reels but now the message lays right there any message you want to hear the prophets speak all you have to do is type it in and he'll play it for you what a blessing this is this morning and i thought you know lord you gave us our freedom naturally and like brother brian said i thought about that the other day i thought you know we want to go somewhere we get in the car we just go we don't have to be stopped and we don't have to be searched and looked at and i thought to live in a country and then for god to bless us in such a way and mine's just it's just an honor i think i think it's an honor brother branham said you know we live in america he said even though all her problems he said but it's still the greatest place in the world to be to live i'm thankful that god blessed us today and i know it's not what it used to be but i'm glad we're going home one of these days and where we're headed it'll be a perfect place amen this is a special day for me and uh many years ago and we always used to tell my mother she was a firecracker because she was born on the fourth of july and today my mother would've been oh that's trying to remember this morning how old she would be in her late 80s close to 90 and and i i get to thinking sometimes of how she'd be and then i thought this morning i thought you know lord i i can't never see her she won't come back here but where she is i can go and land where she's at this morning she's free if she don't have to worry about high blood pressure sugar diabetes and she don't have to worry about getting old she's in a land that we're longing for this morning and this song come on my heart yesterday morning and and i just began to think of everything and then this morning it was on my heart and i know we have it sister donna that song it is mine god's abiding peace is in my soul today amen yes i feel it now yes i feel it now he has taken all my doubts and fears away though i cannot tell you how but it is mine this morning aren't you glad this morning amen in a world that people are messed up on drugs and have to take this and that all we have to do is just

this morning god certainly is worthy of our praise you can have your seats for just a few minutes if you'd like so happy fourth of july i know we've got some in here that had fought for our freedoms and we thank you for that and it's something that seems to be taken for granted nowadays and and just how blessed and fortunate we are to to have those down through history that has fought for the the freedoms that we have um just a quick little testimony if we if we might take a minute here while you're while you're sitting um i think brother david may mention last week that weston was gone out to oklahoma and just to show you how how fortunate and blessed we we truly are even uh just just to say maybe we live where we live in kentucky uh how thankful we should be for our independence and our freedom and they were he was out there working with a couple of churches from a school and working with the native american children and oto is that right oto oto oklahoma and the work out there was started years ago by actually a minister from here in todd county uh i went blank jimmy kenner yeah jimmy kenner uh brother jimmy kenner started up there the lord laid on his heart to go out there in oklahoma years ago to to work with the uh the native american indians out there and on the reservations and just see what he could do to lead them lead them to christ and it's been a very good work it's been a hard work for him i know i went out there i guess it was two years ago we actually took our baseball team out there to do some a little bit of work and just witness and see the the children and try to help but it's been a hard work we talk about our independence and where we live and where we live here we got pretty much the freedoms that we want and and you know you get along pretty good with your neighbor but you can imagine a white man going out into the indian reservations and knocking on a door and saying i'd like to tell you about christ well he's had several doors slammed in his face literally so it's not been an easy road for for bro jimmy out there but just to tell you how thankful we should be for our freedom and independence westin said there was about 150 uh children there and uh out of those 150 three of them went home to parents that lived in a home together with a mother and a father out of 153 went home to but a mom and a dad in the same household uh and most of those children went home to a grandparent uh the other that was left out of the 150. um and so you know we i know today's missionary sunday and and we we send missionary work around the world and and and we're very thankful to be able to do that but sometimes we fail to look within a few miles of us sometimes the children many of them he said didn't have shoes that fit they would they would walk in on the backs of their shoes because their shoes didn't fit when they got the opportunity to take their shoes off they just run barefooted because i'm sure their feet were hurting so you know there's just a lot of things uh on this fourth of july that we got to be thankful for in our own little part of the world here so just kind of let you know what he was doing out there and it was with the several different uh churches i think probably most of them were baptist churches but just want to try to get the word to the children and the children love to come and they love to hear the word of god and they love to the fellowship and so you just trust that over the years and over the time spent that they just continue to get children softened and closer to christ and you know we've heard the prophet tell about it if you're i think if you get a kid if you can lead them to christ when they're young age three to five they'll serve christ the rest of their life and i actually just heard a preacher he was preaching about that on the radio this week and the importance of our kids being in church and in sunday schools and then in the word and so um something there that's it's a good work out there and just pray for brother jimmy and that he'll be able to continue doing that but that's where he was at and thankful that he got that experience because like i said a lot of times we take for granted what's going on a couple hundred miles down the road from us because we live in our own little world and that's just the way it is we are accustomed to what we have around us so if we would let's just stand turn in your bibles to the book of joshua look at joshua chapter 12 i think it's 7 there joshua 7. we'll try not to hold too long today we've got the communion lords communion here and i will try to transition smoothly over into that and um turn to the service to brother byler at the end here but we want to look at a few things this morning talking about uh aiken we're going to look at aiken and joshua and the battles they fought and and how aiken's life was uh was involved so much in the way things went there with the children of israel so joshua 7 but the children of israel committed a trespass and the accursed thing for achan the son of karmy the son of zebe the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing now watch now and the anger of the lord was kindled against who the children of israel let's just bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us for our independence and freedom that was bravely fought for our forefathers and and those that are still fighting today and it seems many times that we uh we we fall short and we we feel restricted and some of our freedoms are being taken away but lord you've blessed us to live in the greatest nation in the world lord and we're thankful for that lord and for all you the goodness that you showed to us father lord we just asked lord that you as the reading of the word went forth lord we just ask that we could be able to look at this and examine it lord not to not to hurt not to not to push thoughts or or feelings will or but to just to draw us closer to you father and lord that if there's if i need correction this morning i pray lord that the word would correct me and i pray that that would be the spirit and the attitude of the bride this morning if we're not ready if we're not right the that the word of the lord would come down and speak to our hearts to draw us close and near to you lord we just want to tell you we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name amen amen you can have your seats so brother branham's talking here and he's talking about joshua and what's going on with aiken and he says joshua after he crossed over into the land god gave him promise to fight an entire campaign without losing a man without even getting a scratch without even having a nurse or a first aid or a a bandage he said god said the land is yours go fight think of it a fighting a campaign and there's no red cross around there's nobody gonna get hurt brother sister god makes some amazing promises god makes some amazing promises in in life and he don't back down on his promises but what we do with his promises affect the outcome of the situation brother brown said among them he said and he's they slayed the amorites and they slayed the hittites and and there wasn't one hurt among them until sin come in the camp and when aiken took that babylonian garment and that gold wedge and he hid it under his camp and then the next day they lost 36 men joshua said stop stop wait a minute there's something wrong something's wrong here we're going to call seven days of fast because god made us a promise and there would be nothing to hurt us and our enemies will fall at our feet so something is wrong here something went wrong because we got 36 dead men laying here our israelite brothers and they're dead why did they die innocent man he said because one man stepped out of line you see this is the reason it has to be taught that's what he said this is the reason this has to be taught and it has to be taught not because we want to uh pick people apart not because we want to throw stones not because we want to make people feel less than what they are but i liked what brother ben how he brought it out on wednesday night that there is a day and a time we have to get ourselves right with god we can't just continually keep preaching and preaching you're the bride you're the bride because eventually you get in your mind that you are the bride and that's what we want we are the bride but we got to be careful that we won't get out such of our mind that we're the bride that's thoughtless on earth we can't get to a place so high but we don't even see our own mistakes is what i'm trying to say we don't even see our own failures that we begin to think things that are that maybe we didn't used to think we're okay but now they're okay we begin to start these things start creeping into our lives he said why did they die innocent man because one man stepped out of line you see there's a reason it has to be taught the church lining up lining up with the word of god he said lining up with the word of god lining up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all men fearing god it's not just enough to be called the bride you know there's a lot of brides a lot of churches call themselves the bride but are they walking upright are they walking soberly are they are they doing all this before men are they are they fearing god in the way that the bride of christ truly should fear god it's a good question now good question he said there's something wrong god made the promise and he says listen when we bring up the sick before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast call an assembly because something's wrong somewhere god made the promise god's got to stick to that promise and he will do it and he said joshua called for a fast and they found out and they cast lots and aiken confessed it and they killed aiken family and all and burnt them and took their ashes and left it for a memorial and joshua went right on through the battles taking everything without scratch or wound so we look here and we see here in joshua six and seven this is a tragic story of aiken and his sin now i'm going to try my best to go through history and slow things down and you're probably going to hear a lot of stuff that maybe you haven't really thought about or brought out but it's part of the history of the life of aiken and i think if we look at it we can tie it right down to where we was because here's aiken one man sinned by stealing a garment 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold after the heat of the battle and he was instructed do not take any of the treasures from jericho the treasures of jericho they are to be devoted to god so keep in mind here that aiken had no accomplice there was no witnesses so there was nobody that knew he'd done it nobody could could point him out he had no accusers but nonetheless because of what he did the israelites were now paralyzed with fear when they go to attack the city of i.e the whole nation of israel their fate depends upon this one person do you see how important your life is and how important you and your organ and the orchestration of god your life is into the plan of god again his life was was determining the whole outcome of what was about to happen 36 men died wives were widowed children lost their father and in the end aiken's entire family destroyed even though they were innocent of his sin the whole nation affected that's what god said god said it was a national sin you look in verses 10 and 12 and he says joshua get up israel hath sinned and transgressed against my covenant he didn't say joshua get up aiken is the one israel has transgressed the whole nation has transgressed against me because of what one man has done so brothers and sisters realize that it's more than just an individualized walk in our life and we do serve god in an individual basis god deals with each one of us individually on a day by day basis but it's bigger than that we may be individually but we're walking in this together we're not walking alone and a lot of times people fail to realize that god is god is wanting to see his bride move in a unit and we need to be another we need to be lifting one another we need to be working with one another and keeping in constant step with what god wants this church this part of the bride of christ to be doing brother branham said on july the 3rd of 1964 he said he fell into a trance and he said when i did there was somebody with me he said i didn't see the person but i just heard the voice and he said i looked and he said the bride will come in for preview you've seen this you heard this you know the story and he said i looked and coming to me i seen the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women i ever seen in my life each one of them long hair long sleeves and long skirts and so forth young women i'd say in about 20. and he said but this bride her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people i've ever seen in my life he said i don't know how many it was he said it was uh they were in the ground in the around about them but she passed by sweetly with an air there was an air about this group of ladies that walked by him that was the bride and the vision there was an air about them the upright they stood before god knowing who they were not as one person but as a group of ladies that stood and walked in line in tune together and he said next he said next we'll review the churches and they come and i notice them coming up each one of them and it looked like they got worse and worse he said i've never seen such a filthy bunch in my life he said and then i said next i heard a voice and it said here comes the american group here comes the american group and he said now i'm an american and he said but this just made me sick he said i'm not even elegant enough to to to speak about it in a mixed audience what was taking place you'll have to read between the lines what kind of day are we living in he said but these women were coming and the leader of them was a witch she had a great long nose and a big mouth and was dressed in some kind of lower clothes down here in the top with just a strap about a half inch strap and and and moving around them like this and he and he said the parts were exposed and he said cut hair and frizzy looking and real short and full of makeup nothing but look like a bunch of street prostitutes and he's looking at this vision 57 years ago and i think he can be seen from yesterday and he's looking at this vision 57 years ago and he said is that the church is that the church and he said there she went and they were singing and twisting to the rock and roll songs and and going down here and and moving this way in that way and they left and disappeared into chaos still marching to the beat of that music into chaos and he said i just started to bow my head and i said wait the bride has to come again the bride must come again he said i looked and here they come and they pass by them sweet looking ladies and i noticed each one of them their hair down the back looked like these were from germany they took german or something like that as i watched them and he said they started leaving and two or three of them in the back kind of got out of step so here's that group of bride from the beginning that's walking the straight and narrow they're all in tune they're marching together they're all on the same mission they're upright they're going forward the most beautiful group then he sees america the most filthy bunch he's ever seen polluted and then the bride comes back through and he's watching but now something's happened one of them or two of them three of them in the back is starting to fall to the side a little bit they're kind of getting off the word just a little bit they're they're kind of leaving this way he said and i wanted to holler at him he's in a vision he says i wanted to holler at him he said but then i seen them and they was trying to get back in step so here's the bride and she's walking and there's a few of them that's trying to start getting and then he said no i was going to holler at them but no i seen them they started getting herself back in step why because they knew who they were they knew that they had to walk in unison it's more than an individual it's a group effort and i like what brother ben said the other night i like when he said it's up to the pastors and preachers it's their job to meddle in your business i don't know if you liked it and my flesh didn't like it i'll be honest i'm thinking nobody build my own business don't nobody need to be in my business but that's not the truth we need people to get into our business and meddle in our business because we become so complacent with life we become so complacent with a word that things like i said that we used to wouldn't do it begins to creep in we find ourselves getting out of step we need somebody to holler we need somebody to holler and to get into our business and let me tell you brother and sister if the pastor can't look at you directly in the eyes and tell you you're wrong in the right kind of way and say i'm telling you this because i want you to get right with god and you can't handle that you've got a real problem and we don't like that because we're men we're adults we're grown men and women right we don't like telling us what problems are it's your soul he's worried about he's not worried about he's not worried about your job yeah he wants you to do well he's not worried about the little things that you worry and fret over so much he's worried about getting your soul to heaven he's not just being a busybody and that's what we want to do a lot of times we want to say that this person is just a busybody but that's not the case god was personally involved with what was going on with joshua and his army i mean after all it is god's nation it's his church it's his people he's going to be intensely concerned about and we look at the story and it contains a clear illustration of sins leavening power until a correction was made the leaven it just didn't lie there and die you know it just increased and increased and increased now i don't understand all the bacon stuff and all how all this works but i know my wife she puts this in the bread and that and her bread and she'll wrap it up next thing you know she's wanting to see i think right he's going to raise the stuff right off off the pot because she stuck something in there that leavened that bread and made it rise up and brother sisters that's what happens in our life if we let these things come in there it don't just lay there jesus said a little leaven leaveneth the lump it don't just sit there and die the sin begins to grow and it begins to consume the area that it's in and it begins to fill that space bigger and bigger and bigger just a little living and brother branham said the minister has got a place of duty to stand and preach the riches of christ without compromising if he's called to be a preacher he shouldn't spare one thing for one person if he's called to be a preacher and as a member of the church he's called to be uh he's called to be a member of this certain group that he would not compromise and if the church believes that we should not gamble then you should never touch a deck of cards we don't like to hear these quotes it's where you where do you draw the line we we talk about a balanced life and yes christians and has to live a balanced life you can't go so far this way or so far that way but he said if we don't believe in gambling you should never touch a deck of cards if we don't believe in drinking you should turn your head completely from drinking some people in a message think it's okay to have social drinks they think it's okay i hope it ain't y'all y'all for quiet he should turn his head completely from drinking if we do not believe in gambling or smoking the member of the church should never touch such a thing god gives complete deliverance he will do it as if we completely surrender ourselves to him if we will completely deliver ourselves into his hand then god can live in us christ the hope of glory can reflect himself from us as we get ourselves out of the way then our thoughts are his thoughts and brother brown says can you imagine christ smoking a cigar and i'm seeing a guy walking down the road and i didn't even have this quote pulled up but i seen this guy walking down the road the other day and he had a cigar in his i don't even know how it was so big i don't know how he had it in his mouth and when i read this quote i thought i can put the two together now i can see i can't imagine christ walking down the road with a cigar so how could this guy possibly be portraying christ what would jesus do that's the theme for the last 25 30 years of my life everybody still talks about it it started out when i was a teenager wwjd what would jesus do i can't see jesus doing that and he says can you imagine smoking can you imagine christ drinking or playing cards it's even hard to imagine a picture in your mind of that it is so incomprehensible to me so why does why is it okay for people why is it okay for christians if he wouldn't do it why would we do it it's simple we the ones that make it hard he wants it upon your confession but you permit the devil to come in and take over and all the time in your heart listen to this all the time in your heart way down deep you know you're wrong when you do those things you might do it but deep down in your heart deep down inside like brother ben talked about you get that convicting power there's a convicting power that comes down and convicts you of the things that you're doing and you know as good as the day is long that what you're doing is not right before god aiken he knew what he was doing was not right before god we can't ignore the convicting power and i think that's where brother ben was trying to go we can't just can ignore when we know things are wrong to stand back and let it continue on and on and on and on if not if we do that we're going to find ourselves in a situation like aitkin was and now your whole family is affected the whole church is affected the whole bride is affected listen to this when one member would talk against another member he's still in the same quote here if one member would talk against another member you know that's wrong how often do we get caught in those conversations you know that's wrong if one member talks about another amendment you know that's wrong and if someone is down let's pick them up you're commanded to pray for one another not to talk against one another but to love one another and if someone is down let's pick them up help them up that's what makes us a unified group of believers marching in step marching in time as a group of believers not as an individual god's going to deal with you as an individual but you're marching in time we're helping each other we're a unified group of believers and he said when you don't obey that you don't but you don't believe obey god and you displease god when you don't obey that you don't obey god and you displease god therefore our church our people cannot prosper our church cannot go on because it's disunified it's not together a little eleven leavens the lump brothers sisters i think whenever we read scriptures and we read scriptures we're supposed to be able to learn from these scriptures we're supposed to be able to take these scriptures as warning signs as beacons and we look at these examples and it tells us don't live like this don't live like that don't do this and here we look at aiken and there's such an example set right here a lesson for the bride of christ on his background his behavior he acted unfaithfully to the devoted things of israel and the lord's anger burned against israel so who is this man that the lord's angers burned against israel so much who is this man that could cause god to look down upon his people and get angry the story i'm fixing to tell [Music] and the words that come out of it are really food for thought because we ought to look at these words and it ought to be a reminder to us and that it ought to awaken us when we become sleepy when we become complacent when we become careless and we draw back and we find ourselves at the personal edge of destruction it angers god sometimes people think about aiken and they want to think and they look at him and they want to think about him being as a as a pagan this man is a bad man this man he he's just full of iniquity he's always on the lookout he's trying to grab property he wants to to gain easy money he's just a common thief and that's the way in our minds we begin to think about aiken but aiken was nothing of the sort of that aegin was one of the prominent families of the noble tribe of judah his father his grandfather his great grandfather carmy zimri zera they all lived a century in egypt under the taskmasters they were the ones that were there in egypt making bricks with no straw they were the ones that were the mud daubers brother sisters his own life had been spared when the egyptian soldiers sought to kill all the babies of israel it was aiken's life that was spared being the firstborn when when the death angel was going to pass through it was his own life that was spared his grandparents his parents his grandparents both of them saw the rise of moses they saw the rise of aaron they heard the miracles that the man done he was right there his parents witnessed the plagues as they come up on the egyptian taskmasters when the nile turned to blood and the frogs came and the gnats and the flies and the death of the livestock the bowls they were right there living this life he's not a pagan he's not a common thief his parents were right there they sacrificed a spotless lamb and sprinkled the blood upon the lentil of the doorpost and prepared a passover meal so that he could live it was his own people's obedience to the word that he's alive think about this aiken's father was right there and he experienced the deliverance through the opening of the red seas he saw the enemies he saw pharaoh and the chariots he saw them be swallowed up with the waves of water he experienced the quails falling from the sky to eat on he experienced the manna as it come down he experienced the water as it flowed from the rock and as he was a little boy he can remember the brazen serpent raised up on a pole and his family looked upon it and we're spared these are the stories that he lived this is the story of the life he lived he can remember hearing the stories about the pyramids and the mighty river and the fish and the abundance he remembers hearing the stories about the patriarch joseph and how joseph was thrown into the pit and how joseph come out and the patriarch was sold into slavery he heard those stories over and over and over so could we say this morning that aiken was raised in the message of the hour think about it don't let the story get so deep that you exclude yourself akin was right there he lived through the experiences brother sisters we have people around the message that's been raised we have kids that cut their teeth hearing the prophet in their bed at night in their little baby bed and they hear these stories over and over and over but where do they walk where do they walk aiken's just like the rest of us here's a young man he ended up he grew up raised up into the message we might say lived all the experiences he grew up and he fell in love and married one the daughter of the tribes and soon they had children that were born and he could see the rewards of god and their tent had to be expanded because more children were on the way he was really prospering and he became a man of substance a man may be a business successful and he labored six days a week and he had flocks and herds and oxen are you with me this is us this morning this is the world we live in this is the life we live message people born in a message raised in the message walk with the prophet was that the meetings god is prospered god is blessed god is give god give abundance and here he is the same person right here if we could say that he would have tractors and farms and marketable products he would have all this stuff constantly reminded of the life that he lived aiken sees his own personal triumph day after day as he obeyed god they entered into the land of canaan and they approached their first obstacle and as they come up to this first obstacle this land of a vast fortress named jericho they come up to this and they begin to look and they they have a strange plan that comes forth from god to joshua you're going to take this city once a day you're going to follow the ark of god and you're going to blow trumpets and you're going to walk around the city and you're going to repeat this for six consecutive days [Music] god laying down the the plan here everybody's in agreeance they're marching they're walking they're moving forward and so again and again and again they go around and around and around but on that last day you're going to give a great shout and you're going to sound the trumpets and then the walls of jericho were going to come to the ground and that's exactly what they did they did what god said and the walls come down those evil people of that city were put to the sword by god command not anything that man done everybody in that city except for rahab and her family died by the sword and not a scratch on the children of israel not not one bit of harm not a not a bruise not a scratch not a drop of blood fell to the ground for the children of israel this was this was aiken this is who aegon was he was a man highly favored he knew god he he knew about the fall he knew about redemption he understood the bible he understood about the lamb the sprinkling of the blood this was the man aiken was brothers and sisters we can be around this message our whole life but if you don't know god i'm sorry knowing a prophet is not going to get you there you got to know the god the prophet you got to go know the god that raised the apostle we hear these stories and they encourage us we hear the stories of all these this was raised and that was raising the fish come to life in a possum and we hear all these stories and they're they're wonderful they're true they're they're true scripturally by the by the message of the hour they're true but do you know the god that made those things happen here's achin a sin of disobedience a sin of covetousness all the spoils of jericho were to be dedicated to the lord the rest was going to be burned with fire and they were going to take all the treasures the gold the silver and eventually they were going to build a big tabernacle to god because it was god's strategy that took down jericho man had no no business trying to take any credit any of the spoils any of the treasures because man had nothing to do with it they were just merely doing what god said so god's strategy was for me to take down this city and then we're going to build a temple someday and god alone was to be honored for this day god alone was the one to get the credit they were just the instruments of god's judgment on these people but watch aiken now aiken enters into the city of rumble of of rummage and and rubble laying around and he opens his eyes into the house he had entered and maybe he was just looking around and he opened up into a little cupboard in the in the in the living room there and in there he sees in there this beautiful babylonian robe and he sees this 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold 50 shekels that's about a pound and a quarter if i'd done my math right 32 000 worth in today's gold the story goes away it goes over thirty two thousand dollars in my mind i'm thinking hey it must have been millions no thirty two thousand dollars and he looks at these and he begins to covet these objects and he begins to take him and he takes them and he hides them away under his tent after god specifically told the people do not take any of the spoils has god ever specifically told us to do anything in my mind i'm thinking of this gold and silver is not worth much but back then it was probably the wages for a dozen shepherds for a year so it's a pretty good chunk of money that he's dealing with and he sees this beautiful robe from babylon and in his mind he's thinking man this is this is this is the most beautiful piece of garment i've ever seen this will be a real family treasure i want to i can take this and i can pass this down to generation after generation this is this is the kind of robe that jonathan wore this is the kind of road that david would have took over this is the kind of road that that we would go to weddings with and i'll go to a feast and i'll put on this robe it's so beautiful why would i let it go to waste a lot of times we think that way we think some of the things that god gives us that doesn't want us to have it's just waste why don't we just take it it don't work that way but here's this road maybe it's it's a robe that perhaps the oldest boy would be presented such a robe when he comes to age here's a road from from babylon the most famous styles and tailoring come out of the land of babylon they're known for their bright dyes and their beautiful fabric those things are hard to not grab a hold of josephus the jewish historian says that the garment that aiken took was a royal robe woven entirely of gold he'd never seen nothing like that and sometimes our eyes gravitate to things that god really don't want us to be involved with but because it's beautiful because it looks like pleasure because it's things that look fun and enticing to us we get in and we begin to take these things and we pull them into the hidden place of our heart think about this gown this rope you know people pay outrageous amounts of money for robes or gowns or jerseys of athletes of movie stars millions and millions of dollars because somebody wore it and here's aiken through dishonesty and dishonorably gained the gold the silver and the garment and paul calls it idolatry it sounds simple it sounds easy it sounds like something that we wouldn't get involved with but brother and sister your secret sins control your life and this is where it gets serious because your secret sins if you're not careful they will take over everything going on in your life you'll begin to get consumed with things that you know like we said you shouldn't be doing aiken hid it under the tent under the floor in his tent and no doubt he was sitting there many times when he would close the door on his tent in his secret place and light up his little lamp he would pull out his gold and his silver and he's weighing it in his hand look at this man i i'm rich why would god not want us to have this why would god not want us to be prosperous look at this rope let me just feel the fabric of it it's beautiful why would god not want us to have this and he's weighing the stuff and he's looking at it over and over and over and he thinks man this is so glorious this is wonderful i'm living the life that's what secret sin does for you you think you're living the life we're going to have to get where the rubber meets the road i read story about men who get consumed in pornography yeah i can hear crickets now and it's a secret sin in their life and they begin to get so consumed by this secret sin in their life that that's all their focus and all their intent they lose their jobs because of watching a video begin to get so consumed in their life with this with this event but it's going on it starts out maybe just a clip just maybe starts out just so five minutes here 10 minutes there an hour here three hours there then you're dis disconnected from your family you're walking out of tune and the next thing you know this begins to consume their lives into such a place that they have no control over their lives maybe it's money people allow money to consume their lives a dollar is not enough two dollars is not enough a hundred thousand dollars is not enough and they begin to get consumed over and over and over and god's probably wondering why don't you show me the kind of attention you're showing to this filthy pornography this filthy money this filthy greed these filthy desires why don't you show me that kind of attention i don't want to be disrespected i'm first in your life brother i don't like this kind of preaching but it's the truth you get you get consumed with these secret sins you know somebody might see you out do something you may say something slight off the word sometime and somebody think oh he's gonna said that or he shouldn't have done that but i'm not talking about those kinds of things i'm talking about the things that you put into your tent i'm talking about the things you hide underneath the floor of your tent that's where your treasure's at what pain and poverty these things cause families what hurt it places on the children in families the distress the children's goes through the loneliness the abandonment coveting items coveting is what makes a man stalk a woman at his place of business coveting is what causes a man to go after a woman that's not his and ruin their family coveting secret sins nobody knows nobody saw me there's no witnesses i've got the gold i've got the silver i got the garment tuck it away if you're coveting for or itching for riches and money and popularity possession success fame esteem glory that kind of covetousness is gonna lead your heart to a dream world because it don't exist it's for a season people would take years years they would spend building up a home a marriage a life kids and give it all for 15 minutes don't place any gold or treasury of yourself but put it in the lord's house don't take it leave it why is it so hard somebody tells you to do something like that god says leave it why was it so hard it wasn't a hard commandment what do you think aiken was thinking about the days after the fall of jericho you know there was there was a time they didn't just leave jericho and go straight to ie and go take it and try to take it over but there was days that went by do you think he's sitting there anything man what what miraculous event took place that we would walk around the city blowing horns and shouting and the walls would come crumbling down walls the chariots drove around walls that they would hold cherry hey can you imagine god is so glorious do you think that's what he's saying no he was tucking away enjoying his little secret sin what a pathetic little man he became his greed his defiance diminished him no longer was he moral moral leader he had no more leadership ability ability about him he was not a leader in his family but he was consumed with things that would diminish away let's look at what happened next with the soldiers of god we know where aiken was we know what he'd done nobody's seen him we know where he's at now the the the stuff is in the tent the the articles are in the tent he's hitting them away and now their next path is to go to ie and joshua being the the the soldier he was he didn't presume anything so in joshua's mind he said i'm gonna send some scouts out to go see what kind of city this place is before we take it over and he sends the guys over the spies to go scout it out and they come back and they say joshua there is nothing near like jericho there they don't have any kind of the fortress that jericho's got this is going to be a cakewalk joshua we don't need half a million we don't we just just send a few thousand men and we will take this city over so joshua then begins to send about 3 000 men and to the shocking of those men now they're tucking tail they're running as fast as they can from this little city that should cause no threat to them and now they look behind and there's 36 men of their fallen friends and family behind them 36 men that died innocently because aiken has one little sin in his life 36 men dead on a battlefield their morale began to disappear from israel their hearts melted they fell down joshua took rent his clothes and fell down face first onto the ground as to say god what have i done what am i going to do he remained there until the evening what a surprise god had become angry with the people and he left them to their own demise and god's teaching them a lesson that christ's people need to be taught today and that is without god we can do nothing but if you take things into your own hands and you become a secret sinner and i hate to say that word over and over but i'm afraid there's times that we have to look at that and we have to really examine ourselves i need to examine myself examine my life my wife needs to examine herself my kids need to examine themselves and say what kind of life are we living and i encourage you to do the same thing don't play with it don't play with it but take it serious because we don't want to be like aiken who looted the school and brought it in there and god couldn't do nothing with him and this little sin ruined the whole nation 36 men killed 36 families destroyed parents wives people defeated crippled the reputation of the children of israel for the next 800 years aiken is the one who made the lord's enemies bold achin is the one who strengthened the enemies of god aiken is the one who brought hardship upon aiken has little sin they begin to consume his life brothers and sisters i just want to take just a solemn moment we're fixing to observe the lord's supper the communion today the bread the body of christ that was broken bruised beaten the wine the fruit of the vine representing the blood that was shed down calvary and as i hear and think about this story of aitkin and i want to transition it over now and i want to just ask each one of us as individuals the communion is not something we take lightly the communion is not something that you play with the communion is a sincere and dedicated time of your life when you have to examine your life and you have to be able to look and you look through the eyes and say do i have anything that i have pulled away and tucked away have i done anything wrong have i done anybody wrong am i being the moral christian that i should be but i'm when i take this i'm representing what god done for me so if we could this morning i just want to quietly bow our heads maybe sister becky if you would like to come to the piano and we'll just transition to brother byler in just a few minutes over into the communion service and let him take over the communion but as we said here this morning if we could just all bow our heads and honestly and sincerely just you and you alone as we get ready to take this communion and we think about this story that we've heard of with aiken i'm asking myself this morning maybe you just play he was bruised or something be fine [Music] and i'm looking at i'm asking myself this morning is there anything in my life that would bring a weakness to this congregation this is our church body as individuals we can go before god continuously day after day after day as long as there's mercy on the seat and we can ask for forgiveness and he's just and he's he's free to give he promises he would do that for his people but i'm asking this morning and myself is there anything that would bring weakness upon this congregation if it is god show me [Music] am i could i be the cause of a blessing not being given [Music] am i tolerating something that god says should be avoided that's a question every message believer to ask yourself am i tolerating something that god says the bride should avoid do i get angry and do i rage do i have malice do i slander [Music] does corrupt thoughts go through my mind or stay in my mind do i do i do i have foul language these are all little things but ask yourself are you secretly are these things in your life do i forgive the grievances when other people have done me wrong do i do i bear with people as a believer do i bear with people you know god's patient with us how should we be patient with others should we bear with people what is that wedge of gold what is that babylonian garment that i have hung in my life do i respect the pastor the way i should do i respect those that that have spiritual authority over me the way i should do i lift them up because they they have such a burden for me do i hold them up with high esteem do i live in peace with my neighbors do i live in peace with the people in the church or am i constantly looking for a way to pay back something wrong with wrong do i try to avoid evil do i treat the younger men as brothers the older women as mothers young women as sisters where is that wedge of gold hiding what is that babylonian garment do i get
