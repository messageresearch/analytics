[29:19] opportunity to be here it's been a been
[29:22] a week and Trust has been a good week
[29:24] for you but it's been a I guess you
[29:26] would say a hectic week for me just
[29:28] seems like one thing after another after
[29:30] another and
[29:31] maybe that's what we needed for this
[29:33] message tonight so
[29:35] uh you know we didn't didn't know what
[29:38] we were going to really speak on I had a
[29:40] thought on my mind and and then the Lord
[29:42] laid this on my mind so turn with me if
[29:44] you would uh we'll read just a quick
[29:46] portion of scripture and I'm going to
[29:47] let you have your seats uh we'll we'll
[29:49] read a quick portion of scripture out of
[29:52] Deuteronomy uh 18 and 15.
[29:57] just to kind of lay a foundation
[30:09] it's not going to be the core of our of
[30:11] our context tonight and and I don't plan
[30:13] on keeping you long so uh we're going to
[30:16] just kind of break down the word and
[30:17] study a little bit tonight and and see
[30:19] what the Lord what happened store for us
[30:21] so Deuteronomy chapter 18 and verse 15.
[30:25] it says the Lord thy God will raise up
[30:27] unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[30:30] thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto
[30:33] him ye shall hearken let's pray
[30:37] Heavenly Father we're just thankful Lord
[30:38] Jesus to be in your house tonight we're
[30:40] thankful for the word uh that that
[30:43] strengthens us it it leads us it guides
[30:45] us it teaches us the ways that you would
[30:47] have us to go there's nothing in this
[30:50] world that we can face that we can't
[30:53] find in this scriptures in the word
[30:55] you've laid it out before us as a road
[30:57] map and we're thankful for that Lord
[31:00] then
[31:03] another portion of the life of David and
[31:06] what David had went through through one
[31:07] of the most tremendous trials that that
[31:09] he could ever experience or ever did
[31:11] experience and and we can't even imagine
[31:13] but Lord we'll see that he
[31:17] he was
[31:19] the Lord and Lord we
[31:21] just want to want you to make us
[31:23] triumphant in our trials and Lord we
[31:26] just want to tell you we love you
[31:29] tonight we dedicate the service to you
[31:30] and we give you honor praise and glory
[31:32] in Jesus name amen you can have your
[31:35] seats
[31:37] as I said when I was praying I want to
[31:39] look at just a portion of David's life
[31:40] tonight and if I were title my message
[31:43] it would be Triumph in the trial
[31:46] and you say well you sure preach on that
[31:48] a lot well I've come to find out I've
[31:51] come to find out over time of studying
[31:54] the word for 25 years and and
[31:57] kind of digging in the word that our
[31:58] lives are in a cycle
[32:00] it's good it's bad it's good it's bad
[32:02] it's good and bad and I don't think we
[32:04] can ever get enough of that because I've
[32:06] come to realize that there's there's
[32:08] good and evil and and ups and downs and
[32:11] and today you may be on the Mountaintop
[32:13] and tomorrow you may be you may be
[32:15] crawling in the lowest Valley of your
[32:17] life we just don't know what tomorrow
[32:19] holds but one thing we do know we know
[32:22] the one that holds it and we can have
[32:24] confidence
[32:25] when we lay down at night
[32:28] that tomorrow is going to be another day
[32:32] and it may be another battle it may be
[32:34] another Victory but one way about it we
[32:36] win the war
[32:37] all right
[32:40] looking at David here and I'm going to
[32:41] start with what the prophet said in the
[32:43] in a message I'm going to read to you
[32:44] just a little bit here to to get started
[32:46] and and he's reading the identified
[32:48] Christ of all ages and he says he goes
[32:51] back to Deuteronomy 18 and he says the
[32:53] Lord your God shall rise up a prophet
[32:55] like and unto me so that scripture
[32:57] cannot be broken
[32:59] he said he had come to the son of man
[33:01] now that was for his age he was here on
[33:04] Earth and when he died and Rose and
[33:06] ascended he sent back the Holy Spirit
[33:08] and that was the son of God God is a
[33:11] spirit and through the
[33:13] Church age he's been Son of God and then
[33:15] the Millennium it's son of David sitting
[33:17] on the throne ruling he has ascended up
[33:20] he that overcomes shall sit with me on
[33:24] my Throne as I have overcome and sat
[33:27] down on my father's Throne he is sitting
[33:29] on the father
[33:31] first Throne now but in the Millennium
[33:34] he sets up on his own Throne because he
[33:36] is the son of David he's the son of man
[33:39] the Son of God the son of Davis
[33:41] see it's perfectly
[33:43] now we find out he had to come as a
[33:46] prophet the unchanging of his word god
[33:49] changes not
[33:51] like I said we're in a cycle
[33:53] we're constantly going and rounding
[33:55] around and God changes not
[33:57] if he was a Healer then he's a Healer
[33:59] now if he was a deliverer then he's a
[34:00] delicious savior the loss then he'll
[34:02] save the lost now he changes not but we
[34:05] can't forget that Satan also changes not
[34:08] he's here to defeat us it's his constant
[34:11] battle just to defeat us and he says
[34:14] David the great man made a mistake a man
[34:18] after God's Own Heart yet took Bathsheba
[34:21] thinking he could hide that from the
[34:23] very God that he had served all of his
[34:25] life
[34:26] but God exposed him by Nathan the
[34:29] prophet and he says yet look at David
[34:32] when he's going out
[34:34] and this is where we're going to get to
[34:35] our story exiled from his own people
[34:39] rejected King
[34:42] a rejected King now remember the types
[34:45] he said he had to be son of man
[34:48] Son of God and Son of David and he said
[34:51] well look at this he said he's the
[34:52] rejected King his own daughter had been
[34:55] ravished by her brother and the other
[34:57] brothers killed him and they was Absalom
[35:00] had raised up and separated had
[35:03] separated the Army calls in a revolution
[35:05] and David his own father was
[35:07] excommunicated
[35:10] we're talking about a serious hardship
[35:13] we're talking about some real stress
[35:15] here
[35:16] and he's been taken away and rejected by
[35:19] his people going out of the city this
[35:22] little crippled like fellow dragging
[35:24] along there making fun of him spitting
[35:27] on him do you see the relationship a
[35:29] rejected King being spit upon being
[35:32] mocked being made fun of
[35:35] David had to go through this by
[35:40] making fun of him and David's guard
[35:43] pulled his sword and said I
[35:45] let him alone
[35:50] let him alone God told him to do that
[35:56] whoa
[35:58] God told him to do that no doubt David
[36:02] didn't know what he was doing but he was
[36:03] walking up the same mound of Olives
[36:06] there and looked down weeping as a
[36:08] rejected King just like Jesus Christ it
[36:11] would come 800 years later
[36:13] a rejected King who sat there and
[36:16] watched him say father forgive them they
[36:18] know not what they do
[36:22] God told them to do that here he is he
[36:25] said a few hundred years after that
[36:26] Jesus on that same Mountain you see
[36:28] these things just portrayed he was part
[36:31] of it
[36:32] God doesn't change his nature doesn't
[36:34] change his character doesn't change he's
[36:37] still the word and Malachi 3 6 proves
[36:40] that he just changed his form from each
[36:42] age each age as a loved part of the word
[36:46] has been prophesied what happened for a
[36:48] certain day well as that age comes along
[36:51] God just moves into another form
[36:55] so we might say that if he's just moving
[36:58] into another form
[36:59] and David had to go through all those
[37:01] trials and David had to go through these
[37:03] hardships and God put him there to go
[37:05] through that and he's moving into a form
[37:08] into another age here we are at the End
[37:10] of the Age
[37:12] where does that put us what is God going
[37:14] to do he's going to move into you he's
[37:16] going to see if you're made to stand the
[37:17] test of time
[37:19] he's going to check and see can you
[37:20] Triumph in the trial
[37:23] can you and I make it through how are we
[37:26] going to make it through how did David
[37:27] make it through we'll find in the
[37:29] scriptures tonight and we'll see very
[37:31] clearly how David could lay his head
[37:34] down at night
[37:36] and sleep
[37:38] Psalms 3 if you'll turn there with me
[37:42] and this is where the bulk of our
[37:43] scripture will come from
[37:49] I found it kind of
[37:51] uh intriguing that I never seen where
[37:55] the Prophet preached on Psalms 3. he
[37:57] preached about the rejected King he
[37:59] preached about David he preached about
[38:01] Absalom and everything that led up to
[38:03] this but when we look at this scripture
[38:05] we'll read this we'll understand
[38:08] after tonight I hope we understand more
[38:10] I hope I hope you're blessed the way
[38:13] this scripture has blessed me
[38:16] Psalms 3
[38:18] says Lord how are they increased that
[38:22] trouble me
[38:27] there are they that rise up against me
[38:32] how Satan loves to rise up against us
[38:36] how he loves to increase our troubles
[38:39] and how he loves to increase our trials
[38:43] he says many watch this many there be
[38:46] would say of my soul
[38:49] there is no help for him and God say
[38:52] that
[38:59] how many knows what sayla means
[39:02] it means pause
[39:04] and reflect on what was just said
[39:08] it means pause and reflect on what was
[39:11] said raise your hands to the sky and
[39:13] take notice and praise God and think
[39:15] about what just was said in the
[39:17] scriptures and he says there's people
[39:19] that's saying there's many that say of
[39:21] my soul there is no help for you and God
[39:24] how many of us have been in a place that
[39:26] we could say people looked at us and
[39:27] said God can't do nothing for them
[39:30] God can't fix their problems
[39:33] they just don't know my God
[39:37] and he says but thou O Lord are a shield
[39:40] for me
[39:43] you are my glory you're the lifter of my
[39:46] head
[39:47] will he read Glory here what David is
[39:50] saying it's a different kind of Glory
[39:52] than when we talk about the Magnificent
[39:53] God and the glory of God and the Throne
[39:56] of God the glory here when it guitars
[39:58] who a man is talking about confidence
[40:01] God you are my confidence you're what
[40:04] gives me strength you're what gives me
[40:05] my confidence God you are the lifter up
[40:09] of my head
[40:10] [Music]
[40:11] and he said I whispered unto the Lord
[40:15] no
[40:17] he said I Cried unto the Lord with my
[40:20] voice and he
[40:21] heard me out of his Holy Hill say lie
[40:30] I laid me down and slept
[40:33] I awake for the Lord sustained me
[40:39] I will not be afraid of ten thousands of
[40:42] people that have set themselves round
[40:45] about
[40:47] arise O Lord save me
[40:50] oh my God for thou has smitten all my
[40:53] enemies upon the cheekbone
[40:57] I like this next part
[40:59] thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly
[41:03] you ever wondered where that sound was
[41:04] I'm Gonna Knock your teeth out come from
[41:10] just found it
[41:12] he's broken the teeth of the ungodly
[41:15] salvation belongeth unto the Lord
[41:19] thou blessing is upon thy people
[41:23] say that
[41:24] so as we begin to look at the psalm here
[41:27] and we begin to read and we see this
[41:29] Psalm written by David and we're reading
[41:31] it already just we just by reading we
[41:33] find inspiration we find encouragement
[41:34] and we find that King David living a
[41:37] life of complete confidence in God
[41:39] during what was no doubt one of the
[41:41] greatest trials that he had ever faced
[41:44] in his entire life and brothers and
[41:46] sisters this very trial was the
[41:49] consequences of David's own actions
[41:55] sometimes we try to blame our trials on
[41:57] Satan sometimes we try to play blame him
[41:59] on God God just given me a trial to go
[42:01] through but many times
[42:04] it's ourself
[42:06] it's our own stinking thinking it's our
[42:08] own ways to get us into trouble and here
[42:10] is David finding himself and the
[42:13] suffering the consequences of his
[42:15] actions and into order to fully
[42:17] understand the extent of David's trial
[42:19] we have to look back into the book of
[42:21] second Samuel second Samuel chapter 13
[42:24] through 18. it picks up where this Psalm
[42:27] originated
[42:29] if you want to study it out I
[42:32] all right I urge you to study it and
[42:34] read and take and and break it down
[42:36] because of chapter 13 of second Samuel
[42:39] M9 one of David's Sons he fell in love
[42:43] with what would have been his
[42:45] half-sister Tamar
[42:48] and he falls in love not so much a love
[42:51] like a husband and wife love but it was
[42:53] a passion it was a desire that he had
[42:56] that he had to be with Tamar and Tamar
[42:59] was the full sister
[43:02] of Absalom
[43:05] and so here we are
[43:07] Tamar is tricked
[43:10] I'm not says I gotta figure out how to
[43:13] get her into my Chambers
[43:15] so I'm going to play like I'm sick I'm
[43:18] going to play like I'm Ill
[43:19] and I'm going to tell my dad David
[43:23] I need somebody to come fix some food
[43:25] for me
[43:26] I'm not feeling well and I'm it can you
[43:28] send Tamar in here to make me some
[43:30] biscuits I need nourishment
[43:33] so David being the good dad since
[43:36] Tamarin Tamar begins to whip up some
[43:38] meals some fiddles some biscuits
[43:40] to feed him and as this is all happening
[43:43] she begins to take the the food over to
[43:46] him and amnon then looks at her and he
[43:48] grabs her and the Bible says he forces
[43:50] himself upon her
[43:52] and she says no don't do this don't
[43:54] force yourself on me this is not not
[43:56] legal this is not right by the laws this
[43:58] is not right at all Stop Don't Force
[44:03] he ravishes Tamar
[44:07] she leaves scarred broken and hurt
[44:11] Absalom her full brother then comes on
[44:13] the scene and says what has happened did
[44:16] he force himself on you
[44:18] yes
[44:20] so now Absalon seeks out to kill and to
[44:25] find and kill him not
[44:27] do you see how this plot is all going
[44:29] how did all this start with Bathsheba
[44:33] Take It on Back take it on back into the
[44:36] scriptures and it all started right
[44:39] there and David now David comes up here
[44:42] and he begins to look at this and he
[44:44] sees what happens he sees it Absalom has
[44:46] now killed and gone
[44:48] and it says that David well continually
[44:51] for his son and he can't get over the
[44:53] law of the Sun and so he vanishes and
[44:56] excommunicates absolutely out of his
[44:59] presence
[45:02] NOW Watch What Happens
[45:04] second Samuel 15.
[45:12] and it came to pass after this that
[45:14] Absalom
[45:16] prepared him chariots and horses and 50
[45:18] men to run before him
[45:21] watch What's Happening Here
[45:24] and the Bible it tells us that there is
[45:26] none to be much as praised as Absalom
[45:31] I want you to see the character and the
[45:33] kind of Beauty and the person that this
[45:34] Epsilon man was
[45:36] and then you'll begin to realize how
[45:38] beautiful and how perfect it seems it
[45:42] seems
[45:43] that the devil is
[45:46] Satan is spy he's slick and the Bible
[45:49] tells us that Absalom was to be much
[45:52] praised because of his Beauty was from
[45:55] the soul of his foot even to the crown
[45:57] of his head there was no blemish in him
[46:01] we're talking about handsome hunk here
[46:04] and this guy here has got everything
[46:07] going in his favor and it says Absalom
[46:10] watch how he begins to Snooker his way
[46:12] in he goes into the early in the morning
[46:15] he goes to sets at the gate
[46:17] and he sits at the gate and he waits for
[46:19] the people to come in who is going to go
[46:21] see the King King David and he sits
[46:24] outside the gate and he waits for him to
[46:26] come by and he says hey aren't you from
[46:28] one of the tribes of Israel
[46:30] yes I am I'm here to see the king
[46:32] and if you read on through you'll find
[46:34] out that he says oh I see see that I
[46:38] matters of good and right there's no man
[46:40] to depute but the king to hear thee and
[46:43] Absalon then says if I were judged in
[46:47] the land
[46:48] you see what he's doing
[46:50] if I were judged in the land
[46:54] every man which had a suit talking about
[46:58] a case or a lawsuit or a judgment
[47:00] something that he was coming to bring
[47:02] before the king he said every man might
[47:04] come to me and I would do him Justice
[47:10] you see how Satan slips in there
[47:13] David no longer is good enough
[47:17] they don't want it the absolutely I'm
[47:19] saying David can't do what I can do I
[47:21] can give you justice and Satan comes
[47:24] into our life and says God can't give
[47:26] you everything you want I can give you
[47:28] this I can give you happiness I can give
[47:31] you Joy I can give you pleasure I can
[47:33] give you peace
[47:35] I can make your life good
[47:39] and Absalon is saying the very same
[47:42] thing here I can do what David can't do
[47:47] so it tells me he's the greatest fine
[47:49] politician there ever was
[47:54] he's a politician standing out there
[47:55] he's he's looking for new new people to
[47:58] come and follow him and it says even so
[48:00] much that when people would come and put
[48:01] out their hand to him to shake his hand
[48:03] or to greet him he would kiss him you
[48:05] know oh yeah you're oh brothers You're
[48:07] so
[48:09] just pull him in
[48:10] reel them on in with his kindness
[48:13] and in the next part of the scripture
[48:15] says that Absalom stole the hearts of
[48:19] Israel
[48:22] hmm
[48:24] men who were who were devoted to King
[48:28] David men who served King David men who
[48:31] gave everything
[48:34] has now had their hearts stolen that's
[48:38] the way Satan does us
[48:42] if we're not careful we say we're
[48:43] Christians and we go to church and we do
[48:46] this and we love God and we serve God
[48:47] and we give our lives to God and then
[48:50] the absolute I say whatever
[48:52] comes sneaking in and he seals our
[48:55] hearts away
[48:58] and we have to be careful that we keep
[49:00] our governed up to say hey I'm a
[49:03] Christian and I do what God says
[49:08] and he stole their hearts away
[49:13] and Absalom continues his plot and
[49:15] continues his theme and he he leaves the
[49:18] country there for a little bit and it
[49:20] says he sent out spies
[49:24] you ever felt like you're being spied on
[49:29] just just say toilet paper in around
[49:32] your phone and you'll have Charmin and
[49:34] Huggies and everything will pop up on
[49:36] your on your ads
[49:39] I don't know where that came from but it
[49:41] just came
[49:44] but you ever feel like you're being
[49:46] spied on because that's what Satan does
[49:48] he begins to get into our lives he
[49:50] begins to look he begins to to tear us
[49:53] apart and kind of pick and say I wonder
[49:55] where he can fall here I wonder where I
[49:59] can get him to trip up over here I
[50:01] wonder if I put this out there yeah yeah
[50:03] yeah that catches his attention right
[50:05] there and the next thing you know things
[50:07] are beginning to be a broadcast that's
[50:09] you that you had no business being a
[50:11] part of
[50:12] and you find yourself captivated
[50:16] by what Satan has done by sending out
[50:18] spies to look into your life on a
[50:20] day-to-day basis
[50:23] they send out these spies
[50:25] now watch what he does
[50:28] Epsilon sent for a hit the field
[50:31] David's counselor
[50:37] David's right hand man
[50:40] the one David trusted with everything
[50:44] I think you'll find in one part of
[50:45] scripture
[50:46] I don't have it in my notes but I read
[50:48] it that David pretty much said God erase
[50:51] his memory
[50:52] because David didn't want this man
[50:55] giving everything that he knew because
[50:57] he knew everything there was to know
[50:58] about David he didn't want him giving
[51:01] Absalon all the information
[51:04] and now all of us now this is all coming
[51:06] around and the Bible says the conspiracy
[51:09] was strong
[51:10] the good and evil the good versus bad
[51:14] the conspiracy was strong in Absalom now
[51:17] is in the middle of this conspiracy and
[51:20] it's strong and it says the people
[51:21] increase continually with him
[51:26] so this Rue this Rebellion to overthrow
[51:31] the kingdom
[51:33] now comes to the attention of David
[51:39] one of his Messengers come to him and
[51:41] says David you're not going to believe
[51:42] this
[51:43] he's going to catch you so completely
[51:45] off guard I can promise you you have no
[51:47] idea what I'm about to tell you but
[51:49] David the hearts of the man of Israel
[51:52] are after Absalom
[51:58] now
[52:00] how would you feel
[52:02] if you were the king
[52:04] of a kingdom
[52:05] that God had given God had had placed
[52:08] you at Reign Over
[52:10] and now here comes somebody has come and
[52:12] began to take all the people
[52:15] and build it up against you and now all
[52:17] of a sudden all the hearts that once
[52:19] loved you and served you now they're
[52:21] going after the person who's out
[52:23] to kill you
[52:26] brothers and sisters is easy to see here
[52:29] that there is a major conspiracy and
[52:31] Absalom is not happy with David because
[52:33] of the way he handled the situation with
[52:35] Tamar so now he's out and he's
[52:37] determined I'm going to bring my father
[52:40] down and it's going to be to the death
[52:42] I'm going to kill him because that's the
[52:44] only way I can take over the kingdom
[52:46] he's got to die
[52:48] and so let me tell you tonight brothers
[52:50] and sisters let it be known that Satan
[52:52] is not happy with you or I either
[52:54] and Satan is determined that he's going
[52:58] to bring you down tonight just like
[53:00] Absalom was determined to bring King
[53:02] down
[53:05] so if you've ever found yourself at a
[53:07] point in life to where you're so beaten
[53:09] and so discouraged
[53:11] and you're so let down that the good
[53:14] news don't even encourage you have you
[53:15] ever been to a place like that you can
[53:17] be so down and so much in the gutter
[53:19] you're in that Valley I was talking
[53:21] about that somebody can come tell you
[53:23] some of the greatest news in your life
[53:24] huh
[53:27] because you're so beat down yours
[53:30] so hurt and there's no encouragement to
[53:33] be found
[53:34] David has to have found himself in this
[53:37] place
[53:37] and maybe I'm describing you today
[53:44] you know sometimes when it rains it
[53:46] pours
[53:49] it's one thing
[53:51] after another
[53:53] after another I'm not talking about the
[53:55] mountain we've all been on the mountain
[53:57] how many has been on the mountain
[54:01] those are fun times those are good times
[54:03] I'm talking about when you're down here
[54:05] scratching and you're digging in your
[54:07] clawing and you're thinking I don't know
[54:08] if I'm gonna make it through this
[54:13] and here's David in that very soon and
[54:16] and maybe you're in that
[54:18] same spot but I want you to know you're
[54:20] in love tonight
[54:22] because God wants you to lift up your
[54:24] head
[54:25] and he's lifted up the head of David and
[54:28] he said I want you to know that God can
[54:29] lift up your head and know that no
[54:31] matter what you're going through in life
[54:33] that God Is Bigger
[54:37] you can put anything in there you want
[54:39] God Is Bigger Than cancer God Is Bigger
[54:43] Than depression God Is Bigger Than anger
[54:45] God Is Bigger Than Temptation God is is
[54:48] bigger than marriage troubles God Is
[54:50] Bigger Than than death I said he's
[54:53] bigger than death because we live
[54:55] eternal
[55:01] and you can lay your head down with
[55:03] confidence
[55:06] knowing that the Lord will sustain you
[55:09] when we look at the Psalms chapter 3
[55:11] here
[55:14] one of the only Psalms
[55:17] that you can tie to a specific incident
[55:19] in the life of David we can pinpoint
[55:22] exactly what David was going through
[55:23] when he wrote this song
[55:26] and when we look at this Psalm we look
[55:28] at this Psalm and we know that the Lord
[55:30] helps his troubled people
[55:33] okay there's an assurance there that
[55:36] simply says that God cares
[55:39] that God hears
[55:42] God does it forsake
[55:45] and in our lives we encounter these
[55:48] troubles and difficulties and
[55:50] discouragement is natural
[55:52] it's a natural response to these and and
[55:54] and to feel defeated and David is
[55:57] sitting here he has reason to feel that
[55:59] way
[56:00] but today God is sending a message to
[56:02] each one of us
[56:06] through the message of the hour and
[56:08] through this Psalms 3.
[56:10] if God don't change and God sees us and
[56:15] God cares for us and if your heads are
[56:18] hung low and you're beaten and
[56:19] discouraged God still loves you
[56:23] sometimes the hardest thing to go
[56:25] through in a trial the part of a trial
[56:27] is to understand and realize that no
[56:29] matter how big the trial is no matter
[56:31] how big the problem is God still loves
[56:35] us
[56:38] [Music]
[56:39] David done some terrible things
[56:42] God still loved it
[56:45] David is going through a most traumatic
[56:47] experience in his life God didn't say
[56:50] you're on your own buddy
[56:52] no
[56:54] he still cared
[56:59] when we look at this Psalm I want you to
[57:01] notice it's the first Psalm with a title
[57:06] when you look at the book in your Bible
[57:07] it will say a Psalm of David when he
[57:10] fled from Absalon his son
[57:13] that is part of the scripture that's
[57:15] part of the the wording
[57:17] it's a title
[57:19] it's written in the Hebrew text it's
[57:21] there for a reason it's to show you how
[57:24] important and how discouraging that this
[57:27] must be just imagine just take Absalon
[57:29] out of it
[57:32] Psalm where David fled from his son
[57:36] how would your fathers feel knowing you
[57:38] had to run for your life from your son
[57:43] that the one that you raised
[57:46] the one you fed the one you sheltered
[57:48] the one you clothed the one you sent to
[57:50] school the one you
[57:52] give your whole life for
[57:54] is now hunting you down like a dog
[57:58] um
[58:00] you see the life events that set this in
[58:02] place we found in second Samuel
[58:04] but the heart of David
[58:07] we find in the Psalms 3.
[58:10] in the heart of David we find here the
[58:12] challenges we find the hurt we find the
[58:14] pain we find what he was going
[58:17] through and when he cries out here Lord
[58:20] how are they increased that trouble me
[58:22] me are they that rise up against me at
[58:25] the re at the writing of this Psalm here
[58:27] David in this great deal of trouble
[58:30] he's looking out here his son is leading
[58:32] a successful Rebellion against him and
[58:34] his previous friends and Associates
[58:37] have now joined the ranks of Absalom and
[58:41] it's obvious that David starts this song
[58:43] by crying the Blues
[58:46] the first sentence is a Cry he's whining
[58:51] well maybe you have never whined to God
[58:55] maybe you've never cried the blues to
[58:57] God
[58:59] but I'll tell you it's okay
[59:02] David says how Lord increase they that
[59:05] trouble me and rise up against me God
[59:09] look at what's happening to me now I
[59:11] Loved You Lord I served you with all my
[59:13] heart I've given my entire life and now
[59:16] all these troubles are all the way
[59:18] around me everywhere I look there's
[59:20] trouble trouble trouble
[59:26] brothers and sisters these forces are
[59:29] increasing
[59:30] all around him
[59:32] and some of his greatest friends
[59:35] have become his foes
[59:39] um
[59:43] that hurts
[59:46] when those you trust those you believe
[59:48] in those that you thanks got you
[59:51] now
[59:53] they're chasing you they're hunting you
[59:56] down
[59:59] and they're increasing
[1:00:01] like I said when it rains it pours
[1:00:04] crying the Blues
[1:00:07] your car breaks down
[1:00:09] your dog gets run over
[1:00:11] you your wife
[1:00:13] loses your your billfold full of money
[1:00:16] it's never happened thank the Lord
[1:00:19] I don't have any money
[1:00:26] but you know what I'm saying one
[1:00:28] challenge after another and you think
[1:00:30] man how can I take any more of this how
[1:00:33] can I think any take any more of this
[1:00:35] and here is David now his entire life
[1:00:38] turned upside down
[1:00:40] and not only is his life turned upside
[1:00:42] down and it's increasingly they're
[1:00:44] getting worse and worse and worse now
[1:00:46] listen to what they're saying about him
[1:00:48] listen to what they're saying about him
[1:00:50] many of they which say of my soul
[1:00:55] now we're not talking about flesh and
[1:00:57] blood
[1:00:58] we're talking about David's Soul
[1:01:00] something that's so connected to God
[1:01:02] this has now become a spiritual warfare
[1:01:04] and people saying he's lost it
[1:01:08] David doesn't stand a chance if there is
[1:01:11] no help for him and God
[1:01:14] he's crossed the line
[1:01:17] oh how many times have we heard that
[1:01:19] some self-righteous
[1:01:21] well
[1:01:24] they can't come to God no more they've
[1:01:26] crossed the line did you see what they
[1:01:27] did
[1:01:31] I would hate to know I had that attitude
[1:01:33] towards somebody
[1:01:38] so I
[1:01:40] I can say this
[1:01:42] I've been around here for a long time
[1:01:46] I've known a lot of you for a long time
[1:01:48] you've known me for a long time
[1:01:50] and I think if we were honest with one
[1:01:52] another we could look out across the
[1:01:54] crowd and say
[1:01:55] probably none of us
[1:01:58] deserve
[1:01:59] what God has done for us
[1:02:07] and these people now are looking at
[1:02:09] David's situation that was so bad
[1:02:13] so bad can you imagine being in that
[1:02:15] place in your life where people look at
[1:02:17] you and say God won't even be willing to
[1:02:19] help him
[1:02:21] these people were there were people of
[1:02:23] Israel so they knew that God was able
[1:02:25] but they began to look at David they
[1:02:27] began to look at his situation and said
[1:02:29] nah not God won't even intervene for him
[1:02:33] they looked at David's past
[1:02:37] like I said we know each other
[1:02:40] that's one of the drawbacks of a small
[1:02:42] Church
[1:02:45] it's easy to know what each person does
[1:02:50] and they
[1:02:52] they remember David
[1:02:54] and Bathsheba
[1:02:57] do you remember do you remember David
[1:03:00] murdered her husband
[1:03:02] so that he could take her as his wife
[1:03:05] do you remember it was
[1:03:08] no
[1:03:09] long ago anything about it
[1:03:14] and they begin to bring us up and they
[1:03:17] begin to look and they begin to figure
[1:03:18] this all out and then they end up saying
[1:03:21] this is what he deserves
[1:03:25] from God
[1:03:31] there's no help for him
[1:03:33] and God
[1:03:36] he's just getting what he's got coming
[1:03:40] consequences
[1:03:43] consequences
[1:03:52] there was a
[1:03:54] there was a little girl
[1:03:56] whose mother was telling her and
[1:03:58] teaching her about consequences
[1:04:04] he said if you don't quit disobeying
[1:04:08] you're going to live with the
[1:04:10] consequences
[1:04:12] and that little girl looked up at her
[1:04:14] mother with trembling eyes and said Mom
[1:04:18] I don't want to live with the
[1:04:21] consequences I want to live here with
[1:04:23] you and Daddy
[1:04:28] we laugh at that
[1:04:31] but I want to get your attention with it
[1:04:33] because the consequences are the from
[1:04:36] the actions of Our Lives
[1:04:39] and David now is suffering for these
[1:04:41] consequences he's going through these
[1:04:43] concerts
[1:04:45] quinces one after another after another
[1:04:48] but they don't change
[1:04:50] you've heard the story about another
[1:04:52] little boy
[1:04:54] another little boy
[1:04:56] every time he done something wrong every
[1:04:58] time he was disobedient his dad went and
[1:05:00] drove a nail in the door
[1:05:03] hundreds of nails on the door
[1:05:07] and when his son comes down and said Dad
[1:05:09] I'm sorry I shouldn't have shouldn't
[1:05:10] have done any of these things I'm sorry
[1:05:12] for what I've done can we remove the
[1:05:14] nails
[1:05:15] he said yeah so he went he began every
[1:05:18] nail out of the door that he had driven
[1:05:20] at her for everything he had done wrong
[1:05:22] every lie he had told every bad word he
[1:05:24] had said every time he had mistreated
[1:05:26] somebody
[1:05:27] and the little boy looked up at the door
[1:05:29] and he began to cry
[1:05:31] and he said what are you crying for the
[1:05:34] never gone he said yeah but the holes
[1:05:35] remain
[1:05:39] hmm
[1:05:41] that can be our lives
[1:05:43] and here is David going through these
[1:05:46] consequences and these people rising up
[1:05:49] against
[1:05:50] him
[1:05:51] and here is a guy by the name of shimia
[1:05:56] and shimmy I always see in the Bible and
[1:05:58] he looks down at Dave this man was a
[1:06:00] terrible terrible angry man
[1:06:03] and he's angry because he felt like
[1:06:06] David had mistreated Saul and he'd done
[1:06:08] Saul wrong and he wanted Vengeance for
[1:06:10] Saul and he looks out there and he's
[1:06:12] wanting this reconciliation and it's not
[1:06:14] going to happen and he comes out there
[1:06:16] and he looks out there and he looks at
[1:06:18] across David
[1:06:20] and he begins to mock him and he begins
[1:06:23] to
[1:06:24] curse at him
[1:06:27] and he begins to look at him and shimmy
[1:06:29] our stands up and he says come out come
[1:06:31] out you bloodthirsty man you Rogue
[1:06:36] now the word rogue means scoundrel
[1:06:40] the word rogue also means Belial
[1:06:43] which is in the in the Bible is tied to
[1:06:46] Satan
[1:06:49] what did they call Jesus
[1:06:51] Beelzebub
[1:06:53] the chief of devils
[1:06:56] now here David is going through the same
[1:06:58] thing from a Mountaintop this man is up
[1:07:01] on the Mountaintop and he's he's sitting
[1:07:03] up there and he's crying crying out in
[1:07:06] everywhere that David steps he's
[1:07:07] throwing rocks at him and he's cursing
[1:07:09] him and he's throwing rocks at him
[1:07:12] and David's servant is this is the place
[1:07:14] where he looks at him he says I should
[1:07:15] go over there and take his head off
[1:07:17] and he says let him alone
[1:07:20] you know sometimes in life we all need
[1:07:21] friends like that
[1:07:23] we need friends like David had there
[1:07:26] that was ready to take off this guy's
[1:07:27] head and help fight David's battles
[1:07:29] because no doubt he looked at David and
[1:07:31] knew that he had to be at the lowest
[1:07:33] point of his life
[1:07:34] and he's looking at he says he came for
[1:07:36] it fight for himself so I'm gonna fight
[1:07:38] for him
[1:07:40] sometimes we need that
[1:07:43] you know sometimes you know I coach
[1:07:45] baseball and sometimes I wonder why I
[1:07:47] coach baseball
[1:07:50] but I'll tell you why
[1:07:54] be careful when I say when I tell this
[1:07:56] story I don't want to
[1:07:58] anyway we have a young man who struggles
[1:08:02] with anxiety and fear
[1:08:05] terrible
[1:08:07] can't come out of his room
[1:08:10] can't be around crowds
[1:08:13] he decides he wants to play ball
[1:08:20] doing a great job
[1:08:21] average average kid average player not
[1:08:24] gonna not gonna win the World Series
[1:08:26] but he's having fun
[1:08:28] his mama's crying in tears because he's
[1:08:30] he's entered into a group now and he's a
[1:08:32] part of something
[1:08:35] we have another young man
[1:08:41] you know I'm tender so bear with me

[1:08:54] problem

[1:08:59] he said it's a big problem I said what's
[1:09:01] the problem
[1:09:03] he said when I was born I had two holes
[1:09:06] in my heart
[1:09:08] he said my doctor won't let me play
[1:09:10] because they heard a murmur
[1:09:13] she won't clear me to play I can't get
[1:09:15] my physical
[1:09:20] she's going to send me to a specialist
[1:09:22] to a cardiologist in Nashville
[1:09:24] I said okay I said hey it's going to be
[1:09:26] okay
[1:09:28] he said I just want to play I said I
[1:09:29] know you do just a little kid
[1:09:32] I said it's gonna be okay I said just
[1:09:34] set out today we'll deal with it
[1:09:37] at the end of every practice we pray at
[1:09:39] the end of every practice
[1:09:42] we pulled the team together
[1:09:45] and I said listen guys we got a serious
[1:09:47] situation here
[1:09:49] I said is it okay if I tell them your
[1:09:51] story so he said yeah so I told him the
[1:09:54] situation I said this is this is a this
[1:09:56] is a real serious situation we need to
[1:09:58] be sincere when we go before God and we
[1:10:00] need to lift up we need to lift him up
[1:10:02] and pray that God would come and move on
[1:10:05] his body and can deliver him from this
[1:10:07] heart murmur who wants to pray
[1:10:10] who do you think raised their hand
[1:10:13] the one with anxiety
[1:10:17] he says I got this coach
[1:10:21] he was ready to fight a battle for his
[1:10:23] brother when he'd been fighting so many
[1:10:25] battles of his own
[1:10:27] and he says I got this coach and I said
[1:10:30] let's do it and we bow our heads and he
[1:10:32] began to pray and you never heard such a
[1:10:34] sin more sincere prayer in you all your
[1:10:36] life and we waited and I said now we're
[1:10:38] believing and we're going to receive
[1:10:40] what we have need of right here I said
[1:10:42] you're going to be fine he goes to the
[1:10:45] doctor and he he he sends us a text to
[1:10:47] the two days later he goes to the doctor
[1:10:49] on his way home and he sends us and he
[1:10:51] says I'm back with the muscle emoji
[1:10:57] we've been again to hand out the
[1:10:59] uniforms the next day and I said I've
[1:11:01] got a very special uniform to hand out
[1:11:03] today I said it's number three he said
[1:11:05] that's my number
[1:11:07] and the kids just erupted him to clap
[1:11:09] and then just praising God because he
[1:11:12] stood in the gap for his brother
[1:11:15] don't thank God don't answer your kids
[1:11:17] prayers
[1:11:20] sometimes and I'm off on a tangent
[1:11:23] sometimes we we don't give kids the
[1:11:26] opportunities
[1:11:28] to be Christians
[1:11:31] we don't give kids the opportunities
[1:11:33] to prove the prayers
[1:11:38] you say well
[1:11:41] how old was too old how Young's too
[1:11:42] young
[1:11:43] all I know is Mary conceived when she
[1:11:45] was 13.
[1:11:50] David
[1:11:52] was 12
[1:11:54] when he was called to be king
[1:11:56] he wasn't anointed king but he was
[1:11:58] called to be king
[1:12:02] we don't need to let down on our little
[1:12:04] guys
[1:12:05] they're powerful
[1:12:09] I got to get back on my text somewhere
[1:12:17] Spurgeon said it this way
[1:12:20] talking about David here he said if all
[1:12:23] the trials which Come From Heaven
[1:12:26] all the temptation
[1:12:28] will
[1:12:29] just sinned from hell and all the
[1:12:32] crosses which arise from the earth could
[1:12:35] be impressed together they would not
[1:12:38] make a trial so terrible as that which
[1:12:40] is contained in this verse it's the most
[1:12:44] bitter of all afflictions to be led to
[1:12:47] fear that there is no help for us in God
[1:12:52] um
[1:12:56] what did God do for David in the midst
[1:12:59] of the trouble
[1:13:02] it says but
[1:13:03] without our shield for me
[1:13:06] when everybody else said God can't help
[1:13:09] you
[1:13:10] God can't defend you God can't hold you
[1:13:13] up God can't support you
[1:13:16] God can't fix your problems he says now
[1:13:18] Lord You're a shield for me
[1:13:21] see David was a warrior he was a king he
[1:13:24] was a warrior he knew what battle was
[1:13:26] and he knew he couldn't do nothing
[1:13:27] within himself and only God could
[1:13:30] protect him
[1:13:31] thou O Lord are my shield I'm under
[1:13:34] attack of this ruthless cunning
[1:13:37] enemy I need a shield David needed a
[1:13:40] shield you and I need a shield we need
[1:13:43] God in our life on a day-to-day basis
[1:13:45] and we need to cry out and declare the
[1:13:48] fact that you God are my shield
[1:13:52] he wasn't asking him to be a shield
[1:13:54] he declared it God you are my shield he
[1:13:58] knew where he stood
[1:14:00] you're my glory
[1:14:03] you're the one that gives me the
[1:14:05] confidence and the courage I need you're
[1:14:07] the lifter up of my head
[1:14:13] you know man find glory in all kinds of
[1:14:16] things
[1:14:17] Fame and power Prestige possessions
[1:14:20] that's not what David was looking for
[1:14:23] David found his glory in the Lord and
[1:14:25] said oh my soul
[1:14:30] I Cried unto the Lord with my voice
[1:14:38] you know sometimes we
[1:14:40] we run into problems
[1:14:43] and we say I need to go pray about this
[1:14:47] and we go into our little chamber
[1:14:54] and we whisper prayers
[1:14:57] nothing wrong with that
[1:15:00] but sometimes you have to get to a place
[1:15:04] silent prayers are fine
[1:15:06] but I will tell you some of my greatest
[1:15:08] Triumph moments when God moved on the
[1:15:11] scene is when I had to go up into the
[1:15:13] top of the hill and get in a deer stand
[1:15:15] and I cried unto the Lord
[1:15:18] and I said Lord I need you to hear my
[1:15:21] prayers I need you to listen to what I'm
[1:15:23] saying I need you to be vocal with you I
[1:15:26] don't know how far you are up there but
[1:15:28] I'm gonna make sure you hear me and I'm
[1:15:30] crying unto the Lord
[1:15:33] and David finds himself crying unto the
[1:15:36] Lord and what does the next verse say
[1:15:38] and he heard me out of his Holy Hill
[1:15:42] he burned me from the very portals of
[1:15:45] Heaven the windows of Heaven
[1:15:47] been opened up and God said I hear you
[1:15:50] David
[1:15:55] I hear you Peter I hear you Joe I hear
[1:15:59] you Becky
[1:16:01] I hear you Tommy
[1:16:03] when we cry the Lord he hears our voice
[1:16:12] and I laid down and slept
[1:16:17] I'll wait
[1:16:20] you know to be able to sleep in a trial
[1:16:22] like this
[1:16:24] David had a special kind of confidence
[1:16:30] how in the world could he sleep with his
[1:16:32] life on the line
[1:16:36] when we get ready for bed at my house
[1:16:40] my lovely wife will ask me did you check
[1:16:42] the back door
[1:16:48] y'all do it too
[1:16:50] sometimes I say yeah it's all right
[1:16:56] and she'll say you didn't check it did
[1:16:58] you
[1:16:58] and she'll throw them covers off and
[1:17:00] she'll go check it herself
[1:17:03] they have no security system
[1:17:06] David didn't have two vicious dogs
[1:17:08] sitting outside of his door
[1:17:12] got it here's when to learn tomorrow is
[1:17:16] going to come and God was going to see
[1:17:17] him through and we need the same kind of
[1:17:20] confidence
[1:17:22] because he says you will sustain me
[1:17:30] God sustains us in our sleep
[1:17:34] we take it for granted many times but
[1:17:36] when we're asleep we're dead to the
[1:17:38] world sometimes
[1:17:41] you don't know who's coming through the
[1:17:42] door
[1:17:44] but when I lay down God knows
[1:17:49] foreign
[1:17:51] he will sustain you
[1:17:53] so when the devil is hot on your heels
[1:17:55] it's time that we begin to remind
[1:17:58] ourselves who God is that God is our
[1:18:01] sustainer he's our great physician that
[1:18:03] God is our counselor he's our Banker
[1:18:05] he's our conqueror that God is all of
[1:18:08] these he's my best friend that's the one
[1:18:10] I like the most
[1:18:12] then I've got a friend in Jesus that
[1:18:14] nobody else can compare to
[1:18:17] David refused to let fear control his
[1:18:21] life and I'm hurrying now he says I will
[1:18:23] not be afraid of ten thousands of people
[1:18:27] let me tell you brothers and sisters ten
[1:18:29] thousand people is a lot of people
[1:18:31] hunting you down
[1:18:34] the Army has people the Navy has people
[1:18:37] they have one person can hunt down any
[1:18:40] body around the world can you imagine
[1:18:42] ten thousand trained Warriors and
[1:18:44] soldiers men who knew how to fight in
[1:18:46] battle are hunting you down but David
[1:18:49] says I will not be afraid of them I
[1:18:52] refuse to let fear control my life
[1:18:55] he didn't say fear wasn't present
[1:18:59] anybody tells you they don't fear
[1:19:01] nothing they're lying
[1:19:04] if they tell you that I don't have any
[1:19:06] fears
[1:19:09] um
[1:19:11] but David found courage in the Lord
[1:19:15] I read I run across this little sentence
[1:19:17] here and I hope it stands out to you the
[1:19:19] way it did me it says courage is fear
[1:19:22] that has said its prayers
[1:19:26] that's a good
[1:19:28] what's going on
[1:19:29] courage is fear that has said its
[1:19:32] prayers there's many times in my life
[1:19:34] even this is past week that when life
[1:19:36] gets hectic and stress comes on you can
[1:19:38] begin to feel the pressure and you can
[1:19:39] begin to feel the tightness and you can
[1:19:41] begin to feel a little bit of fear and
[1:19:42] anxiety and you just have to take a deep
[1:19:44] breath and say I'm not afraid
[1:19:50] just as David has done I'm not afraid
[1:19:57] arise O Lord for you have struck all of
[1:20:00] my enemies
[1:20:01] David's mind here is trusting God to do
[1:20:05] what he's already seen him dying
[1:20:08] he is already seen God In Action
[1:20:10] multiple times and let me tell you
[1:20:12] brothers and sisters we are too and I
[1:20:15] wish I would start doing it and I
[1:20:17] encourage all of us we ought to start
[1:20:19] keeping a journal
[1:20:21] and you want to write down every single
[1:20:24] day before you go to bed what did God do
[1:20:26] for me today
[1:20:29] because sometimes we get into places in
[1:20:31] our life and we think
[1:20:33] I know if God hears my prayers you know
[1:20:35] what you could look back on January the
[1:20:37] 10th you could look back on January the
[1:20:39] 9th you could look back in 1980 you
[1:20:42] could look back in 19
[1:20:43] whatever
[1:20:45] God done something for you every single
[1:20:47] day of your life and David by having
[1:20:50] these journals David's Psalms are
[1:20:52] nothing more than a journal of the life
[1:20:54] that he's been through and delivered of
[1:20:56] God God delivered him of his adversaries
[1:20:59] over and over and over and he's he's
[1:21:01] sitting there he's now he says you've
[1:21:03] struck my enemies
[1:21:05] I know you can do it again so I'm Not
[1:21:07] Afraid arise oh Lord
[1:21:11] and move into action
[1:21:13] when he says arise that's a military
[1:21:16] word and Moses used it back when the
[1:21:19] children of Israel he said arise and he
[1:21:21] began to call up an army and David here
[1:21:24] is telling them hey arise Lord go fight
[1:21:28] my battle
[1:21:32] sometimes we're not assertive enough
[1:21:36] we should never demand God
[1:21:40] but when we know what God is going to do
[1:21:42] for us when we know what he he eagerly
[1:21:45] presents for us
[1:21:47] we ought to just saying gosh go fight
[1:21:49] this battle I don't have I'm not going
[1:21:51] to worry about this
[1:21:54] God go fight my battle and that's what
[1:21:56] David is saying arise God don't fight my
[1:21:59] battle knock their teeth out
[1:22:04] I seen you do it before and I know
[1:22:06] you'll do it again go fight my battle
[1:22:09] he's Ford he's he's foretelling what is
[1:22:12] going to happen at Calvary and when we
[1:22:15] look into the New Testament it says oh
[1:22:16] death where is thy still thing the
[1:22:19] Stinger's gone
[1:22:20] crave where is thy victory
[1:22:24] David is saying you're not the teeth out
[1:22:26] of my enemies and salvation it said
[1:22:29] Belongs to the Lord
[1:22:32] what did they sell David
[1:22:34] all they say for my soul
[1:22:38] there is no help from me and God
[1:22:41] and David now has quit crying the blues
[1:22:43] and he says oh I'll remember what you
[1:22:46] said salvation Belongs to the Lord it
[1:22:50] belongs to the Lord it isn't somebody
[1:22:51] else's property they can't take it away
[1:22:54] from me it's something between me and
[1:22:56] God and God give me salvation so they
[1:22:59] can't take my soul
[1:23:08] David makes this Con confession of trust
[1:23:12] when no one would help him God was his
[1:23:14] shield
[1:23:16] when David had nothing to treasure god
[1:23:18] was his glory
[1:23:19] when there was no one to encourage him
[1:23:21] God lifted his head
[1:23:24] when David cried out God heard him
[1:23:31] so if your head's hung low
[1:23:33] you've been beaten by trials you've been
[1:23:36] talked about mocked spit on rejected
[1:23:40] and people tell you there's nothing God
[1:23:41] can do to fix you
[1:23:45] I say that God comes down and he'll stay
[1:23:47] right there and he'll deliver you
[1:23:51] the Wolves sometimes nip at our heels
[1:23:55] the Wolves of the world running you down
[1:23:57] and maybe you'll be losing sleep and
[1:23:59] you're discouraged and it seems like the
[1:24:01] light cannot shine in the pit
[1:24:05] God will get in the pit with you
[1:24:10] I'm gonna close with this little story
[1:24:12] so you were so you'll remember the
[1:24:15] message
[1:24:16] there was a man a grandpa
[1:24:18] went to visit his little two-year-old
[1:24:21] toddler
[1:24:22] granddaughter
[1:24:26] the mother lays the baby down to sleep
[1:24:28] puts it in the pen there
[1:24:30] puts the baby
[1:24:32] a little town the baby cries and cries
[1:24:35] you know how they do they cry she says
[1:24:36] she just needs to cry it out leave her
[1:24:38] alone
[1:24:39] and Peppa goes over there and reaches
[1:24:41] into the pen pulls her out of the pen
[1:24:42] and pass her loves owner and the Mama
[1:24:45] comes back
[1:24:46] what are you doing I told you she needs
[1:24:49] to cry it out
[1:24:51] she needs to just cry it out and she'll
[1:24:52] be fine this is my baby I'm gonna raise
[1:24:55] her the way I want to raise her so let
[1:24:57] me have her and put her back in the pan
[1:25:01] puts her back in the pen
[1:25:03] she leaves the room
[1:25:06] wow you know they do instantly
[1:25:09] crying again and crying crying crying
[1:25:12] and Peppa was in a pickle
[1:25:14] because he's looking and the baby's
[1:25:16] crying
[1:25:18] and he's trying to figure out what am I
[1:25:19] gonna do
[1:25:22] she told me not to get her out of pen
[1:25:33] is in the pen with her
[1:25:36] and he coddles the baby
[1:25:38] and that's the way Jesus is with us
[1:25:40] when we cry the wowzy wowzy Blues
