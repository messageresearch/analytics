Seals if you'd like to read it I thought well if he's EX in arrested I thought well that's might be a big bunch to chew off to start but I thought Lord he brought it up so we'll just let him take it and read it and so and I said I'm going to bring you the book it's called the Revelation the Seven Seals I think it's what I told him and or I just told him it about the Seven Seals and so I forgot it

is fighting against you amen uh did you have that clip mic ready or can you play that clip amen and uh I'd like to play a clip and also have sister Sher give a testimony before we get started this morning um so let's just do while you're getting that ready sister Sher let's have you give your testimony she's got a testimony she'd like to give the for the Lord and and give him a praise and so forth and I don't know just what all she wants to say but come on you want to me to bring you the microphone or did you want to come up here all right here you go the stage is for other people um I think many of you know uh a year ago last May I was um diagnosed with cancer and I still have it but I'm praising God because he's keeping it at Bay that it's not moving at all right now and they're hoping it's going to stay that way um I always start to say things and I forget uh but anyway I'm praising God for that every day but since May a lot of other things have happened Satan has been working on me healthwise and I just keep looking to God every day for every everything that he's done for Satan has done to me I've looked up toward God and ask God to give me the strength to get through it and to help me get through it and I've often also have claimed healing on everything including my cancer I know he will heal my cancer but it be in his timing he has a plan for me and I plan to stay with that plan the reason I bring this up is I know a lot of people struggle with a lot of things it can be work it can be uh you know maybe some a neighbor it could be somebody else it could be another problem you could have an emotional problem or a health problem but I have learned over this past year that the more that Satan throws at me the closer I want to get to God because I know God's going to take care of me uh several months ago about 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning um I had a bunch of words coming through my head uh don't know why except that God put him there and uh I was urged to get up and put him on paper and when I was finished I realized it was a poem I am not a poem poet La it never will be but I'd like to share this with you because this will kind of tell you where I've been what's happened to me and how I've dealt with it and I can share this I've shared this with a couple of other people in the church I have changed it um but I have shared this with the other people in the church and I've also shared it with people that do not go to our church because they need to hear what God can do as well I entitled this the devil doesn't know the devil gave me cancer to turn my eyes away from my heavenly father and worship Him each day but the devil didn't know the devil calls my heart each second to skip a beat he said he'd make it better if I bowed down at his feet but the devil didn't know the devil gave me a kidney stone the pain was so severe he said he'd take the pain away and wipe away my tears but the devil didn't know the devil gave me an aneurysm on my aort to make me scared the devil thought he'd had me and tried to show me he cared but the devil didn't know one more time he caused a leak in my aorta though it is small he said he could fix all this if i' and I'd be free from it all but the devil didn't know what the devil didn't know was the trials he threw at me made my fi faith in God stronger and he should leave me be my God is bigger and better than the devil could ever be my life is in the hands of God and He will always be with me my God is my physician in times he will heal me you see I have an awesome God who loves and cares for me and I think we all know that our God is more awesome than anybody in the world could be and I want to thank all of you for your prayers I still need them because I can feel them but he's given me a piece through this whole situation every diagnosis that was thrown at me I just felt like okay God here here we go again I just need your help and I need to strength my strength needs to depend on you and that's where it does but the prayers help as well so thank you all for your prayers amen e e for like um hold on uh I just want to say a few words you know whenever brother Tommy posted this on our men's prayer group amen and I watched it I think it's all appropriate but you know we like to watch what's happening in the world ain't that right just as we would watch Israel or watch things that are going on and I believe it was in the souls in prison now if you remember brother brandham said that the Baptist met Methodist and all those people were coming after the oil he says could it be that this is the time that they the foolish virgin is coming after the oil he says because he makes a statement he says because the Bible says that they when they do come they don't get it isin that right amen and I thought that many years ago the prophet thought maybe that because of all the ones that were coming in and uh you know from the different denominations and so forth that perhaps that was the foolish virgin going after the oil and you know uh but you know just in my way of thinking you know perhaps that was not so much the the foolish version going after because we've went through a lot of time but perhaps that was a time of actually people coming out of those denominational systems and coming to Christ is't that right but he did make the statement that when that foolish Virgin Goes after that oil amen it's uh it's real close to time isn't it amen because God comes when he come when they begin to go after that oil the Lord comes and he takes his bride away is't that right so I don't know I don't know what this is this could not be might not even be the foolish virgin because of how far out this is okay because of how uh into the world into Sodom like that it is this could be merily this could merily be the sodomites knocking at the door or trying to find the door because if you remember brother Brandon preached he says you know whenever and he was talking about Billy Graham preaching to the Pentecostals and preaching to all of that c C group that Billy Graham preached to amen and he would have altar calls and the people would constantly thousands would come to the altar right and and and brother Billy would say you know I come home I have thousands of converts when I come back next year I may have two thousands and I don't have 20 and you know and brother Brandon was was trying to correct him and talking about he says you know he says he doesn't leave far enough you know and they were he said that what they were doing what it was actually doing it was actually blinding them because they are wearying themselves to find door cuz remember the sodomites they were come to lot's door and they were trying to get into his house but they were struck with blindness and they couldn't find the door ain't that right so just year repentance or just here coming to the Lord amen and just come coming to the altar how many knows that you got to go further than that amen God has to come and give you that baptism of the Holy Ghost isn't that right when Paul had a convert he come back next year he had great great great grandchildren amen and brother bam talking about you know they woried themselves to find the door and perhaps this might be even the the group that is in that category I'm not here I'm not a prophet I can't tell you exactly what it is but I want to play it just to kind of get up to date and watch a little bit of what's going on in the world Amen because how many knows one wants to know what's going on watching the signs of the time ain't that right so we'll let brother uh Mike if you would just play that clip up till a little after the 700 Club if you'll notice let me just say a few couple more things so that you'll take note whenever you're watching it if you'll notice this group is under the uh banner and under the influence of of Christian rock music okay and it's all about the lights it's all about the big screens it's all about that and and about the music and uh uh so just look at that and there's something else that I want to point out the other point is is that they're saying that all of the churches are participating in this even the 700 clug and those who would perhap considered more conservative even they're participating in it all right so you know that what you participate in you tie yourself too amen and so if you're part of that well that could be a scary thing amen but uh you know if you'll see it you'll realize that these people have no dress code nothing or whatever or no fruit for repentance at all just she you know uh you know for the most part it looks like just a new thrill or whatever it might amen but I would hope and trust that out of it at least you know somebody some good is done ain't that right but I just want to play this before we get into the message this morning amen and let you amen see this for just a minute so just take note and realize the lateness of the hour God bless you Amen brother Mike if you would play that in California churches across the Golden State recently came together to host the nation's largest ever baptism as CBN Charlene Aaron reports an estimated 12,000 people took the plunge it's part of a nationwide summer of Spiritual Awakening we declare at this speech that Jesus Christ is Lord thousands made history by joining the baptized California movement at beaches and churches across the state day one was a mighty move of God read a post on the group's Facebook page another post addit today was powerful more than 6,000 entered the Pacific at Huntington Beach with the additional 6,000 people immersed in churches across the Golden State Pastor Mark Francy the Visionary behind the Monumental event spoke of even Satanist joining in it was a special weekend we did see a lot of people so many cool stories there's they're flooding in from Satanist that you know came to the beach that got radically encountered by the love of God and end up getting baptized spontaneously to one young couple you know um one couple literally proposing the guy gets baptized comes out of the water has a ring in his pocket proposes to his wife on the beach Francy helped entire families who made their way to the water I baptized one family that probably had 17 people between kids nieces nephews Aunts Uncles everyone getting baptized crying hugging I mean it felt like a book of Acts um page churches from various denominational backgrounds also played a role it's not about one denomination it's an it's an uh inter denominational effort it's a really a Great Commission mandate that's that's allowing everybody enough room in our Doctrine to go look we might not see eye to eye on every single tenant of our faith but we all do agree that Jesus told us to go into all the world Make Disciples of all Nations baptizing them the baptisms come on the heels of a move of God happening in other parts of the country as Florida beaches the Texas gulf and rivers in the midwest have become epicenters for Mass baptisms now with the success of baptized California Francy is already raising the bar for 2025 with an event called baptize America so we'll have two expressions we'll have Sunday morning on Pentecost Sunday June 8th that all the local churches will open up their their their facilities right after your last service of the morning time that everyone baptizes in local churches and then that evening we'll do Regional events All Over America but we already have I mean we have some denominations some non-denominational networks with thousands of churches saying we want to plug this in and encourage everybody in our movement to be a part of this Charlene Aon CBN News exciting to see thanks Charlene Gordon back to you it is exciting to see and and and it's so scriptural when the enemy comes in like a FL God always raises up a standard I'll give you a lesson I I learned about two weeks ago amen we won't let that play out I just want it to go long enough to let you see that even those people are involved and condoning it and are all for that amen so how many knows that that to me that really Point towards the lateness of the hour amen because we know what brother Bram said that there'll be millions and billions of people who think they're worshiping Jesus and actually worship the devil amen oh they use Jesus and how many knows the devil loves to use Jesus's name the Catholics use Jesus's name amen and killed 68 million Christians amen but how many knows that we need a deeper walk with God we as the Believers amen we need to be ready amen be ready for what's ahead lays ahead for the Lord could come at any time amen praise the Lord stand with me this morning amen we'll just get into the word of God I would like for us to if we have to this afternoon amen and uh we'll we'll see how long it goes this morning but can I take my time this morning I would like to take my time I've got about five pages here but it all depends on how the holy spirit moves amen amen but uh if it goes if we do have to change it to like 3 o'cl for the afternoon service we will amen but I just want to take my time this morning and preach on something amen something that we've heard quite a bit before and I don't know just how amen the Lord will help me to bring this out I know it'll take the Holy Spirit to really bring it out amen but uh I want to speak on the message amen something that brother Bon preached on many times amen I'm not sure I didn't count it but I looked down through there amen and he preached at least five six different times on on the simple word of why amen why so why was a pretty po important question to prophet of God Amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and your Prophet has taught us and showed us how that lord it's good father to Bow our heads and to talk to the author of the book before we open the book lord and father I ask you to give us the Divine uh inspiration Lord Jesus to be able to say father and and say what your word says in the way that you want to said father and Lord the ears of the hear hearers Lord that they would hear it and be able to have their understanding Open Lord to what's really going on father and what you're trying to say to the people Lord and I do believe God that you've got a voice this morning and you've got your spirit that is crying out to your people Lord and father May each one even as I already have been kind of showed lord of the direction God this service is going to go and how it's going to go Lord but I ask God In The Name of Jesus that you'd help each one father that has come here and those that are streaming Lord that they might be able to hear with their heart what you have to say to us Lord Jesus and we just Lord give you the Liberty to speak father this morning Lord we ask God your blessing upon the reading of the word our gathering together and those who are streaming in jesus' name amen and amen and bless those who's traveling amen if you will turn to the Book of Jeremiah Jeremiah 8 amen we want to read Jeremiah 8 we begin with what I'd like to do is amen preach a little bit on what the brother brandom talked on on why and then I want to basically give you amen another uh a different why I called it a different why am Meen it'll be kind of the thought that I had got come into my heart amen and I'll share with you in a minute exactly where it started from and then from where there that it'll go this morning service is going to be more or less a message that is uh centered around worship amen centered around worship and you wouldn't think so but amen uh it's it's a worship I would call it a worship message amen praise the Lord so Jeremiah 8 and I think and you pull that up brother Carson Amen in verse 20 the Harvest is passed the summer is ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt I am black as punishment has taken hold on me now verse 22 is there no bomb in Gilead is there no position there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered amen God bless you you can be seated this morning brother bam five times five different times amen preached on why amen of course he had a hard time amen understanding why that people would not be healed and why they weren't at the place that they should be after all that God has done for them amen now when he was preaching this message amen he was um Tulsa T in Tulsa I believe it was Amen in 1960 and he was talking to brother Williams and both senior and Junior and brother osbor he says and brothers and sisters may it never die may it stay alive I am so happy this morning to know that after all these about 14 years to come back into this church and to find that glorious Spirit moving among the people amen if you'll go back that if you ever want to see that 1960 and and 0401 in the morning amen and you can get the full scope of it but he got back there and he talked about how he could look at the sisters faces how they were clean and everybody had a glow on their face and everybody was basically the way that you're supposed to be and and in order and no makeup and and the sweetness of the Holy Spirit was there cuz how many know that's a real treasure the devil don't like that in a church he don't like that in an individual amen and he he'll do anything to take that away from you now listen to what he say said that glorious Spirit moving amongst the people it is such a jewel such a presence of God and it is so scarce think about back in his day saying that sweetness the presence of God in a church is scarce woo think about it today you know what I had to think as you know because we know that the devil's ambition is always to grieve the holy spirit away he don't like a church on fire he don't like a person on fire this with the help of the Lord I'm going to show you I'm going to tell you what amen uh about some of the things that take those takes that spirit and takes it actually sucks the life out of you so to speak everything in the natural is geared Amen to uh uh not let you go forward spiritually even the cares of Life all right praise the Lord amen oh my it's such a jewel I'm sure this morning that you don't realize how well off you are think about it he says you don't realize how well off and how nice that is for you to have that amen oh my it's such a rest you're so well off it's such a rest for my eyes to look upon people's faces and to see the glory of God praise the Lord amen then he always goes on to talking about the story he says it's like that old salt amen that was coming from the sea and there was an artist going to the Sea amen he was talking about how that that artist wanted to hear the goals he wanted to hear amen the waves roll and he wanted to see the sunset and feel the breeze amen and such a glorious thing and amen and when he went and talked to the old salt he says I don't see nothing So Glorious about it he says that's what probably what people what happens in church amen is people come into the presence of God they come into church amen and they don't really appreciate it anymore how many know we as human beings things amen it is so easy for us Amen to not appreciate the presence of God anymore oh my people get away from it and so forth and don't amen how many knows that even brother benam said about the Tabernacle even the people of the Tabernacle amen discernment would go forth here in America discernment would go forth and mean Jesus would come to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart how many know only Christ can do that why one discernment should have set the whole church on fire amen everybody should have been surrendering to God and praising God but he says no it's become so common to you until they just go and say well I guess it was a pretty good service I wonder how we'll go from this morning service well I guess it was pretty good amen I want you to understand something when we come to the house of God we are not a bunch of Spectators we're a bunch of participators amen amen praise the Lord when Jesus Christ amen how many know Amen brother B said is there no bombing Gill it is there no toxin is there no medicine oh my and he goes on to saying why do people crows why do people go to bars why do people drink why do people smoke why do people try to satisfy by putting their name on the book he says amen there's a real genuine satisfaction none of things will ever satisfy it'll never cure what heals you if you're sick God is here to heal you the Cure is here amen if your selfish The Cure is here I mean know Jesus Christ was the test subject it was tested on him in Matthew 4 the devil took him up in the high mountain he tempted him he tested him amen he tried him at all different points in lust of the flesh lust of the eye pride of life amen but he got his b feathers burned amen he got sined and I want you to understand that that same power that Jesus has the believer had amen it's the Cure over [Applause] Temptation amen my my my some people you miss service for two weeks and a couple of service and man man no alive wait till I get started you love him this morning oh the God is good isn't he amen God is good let me get this other one here see if this coms up here it is right here first thing oh brother B the same message it's joy unspeakable and full of glory amen W he say oh I feel twice my size yes sir I'm home now and I'm glad I'm glad that we have come out I'm glad you come out W I'm glad I come out aren't you happy that's right oh my what God could do with this little group right now what he could do if he could ever get one person in his grip so just he can hold that one person he could put 10,000 to flight with that one person with one person with genuine Faith he can put 10,000 Devils running just as hard as they can W if one person will just get free amen and get in the hands of God you could Chase every devil out of your country amen tell You' experience nothing but freedom freedom from anxiety Freedom From Fear woo he can if you can God can just take one person in his hand he can make 10,000 Devils running as hard as they can go there they go there they go They're scattering already brother breath they're already scattering why because the sheer power of the word of God and a Believer makes the devil's tremble makes him scatter are they gone yet I don't hear him no more must be gone amen them Devils of lukewarmness them Devils of mediocracy amen this morning I want to talk about you what God says about you amen praise the Lord I told you it was a message of worship this is about worship praising God in spirit and in truth amen I didn't have time to set this thing never to go off let me see here the Christian has not one worry in the world how many know as you get older you worry more you worry about your health you worry about your future you worry about this you worry about anything you can worry about but the Holy Ghost is come to take that away from you he said they should be the Christian they should be the most freest happiest people in all the [Music] world right cuz there's nothing they can't lose all things work together for them that love God who are the called ACC according to his purpose amen how many knows that when Jesus Christ came when he lived his life and when he paid the price ain't that right on Calvary he produced a cure he produced a toxin Amen to

got the Cure if you don't have fellowship with God he's got the Cure if you got the blues if you're downhearted if you are brokenhearted that's what he come for for the downhearted for the Brokenhearted to menend the broken hearts to give you what I read this week don't know how true it is you know how media is but they said a billionaire was dying a young billionaire was dying on his deathbed he says you know when you come down to the door of your death of death wealth doesn't have much significance doesn't have much significance anymore he says whether you're driving someplace in a $150,000 car or a $2,000 car you get there just the same had a few good pointers few other good things that he said and one of the things which he said I would advise that if your parent just to tell and teach your children to find happiness to find happiness I thought you know he could add a little bit to that he could add peace to that he could add righteousness to that and I where you find righteousness and peace and joy amen it's in the kingdom of God Paul said and the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but it's righteousness it's faith and it's happiness so you have this morning what a billionaire said he wishes his children would have happiness don't you realize that's what the world that's one of the main desires of all humanity is to have peace is to have happiness is to have joy that's right happy wife happy life happy husband happy life I'm gonna add one to it is that all right everybody want to be happy we want everybody happy and there's no reason why you can't be there are so many things in this world to drag you down isn't that right so many reasons not to be happy worry fret cares all these things but yet in the midst of it all aren't you glad that you can have joy that you can have peace amen that's what he came to do that's what he came to give it brought it back brought the cure for for Spiritual sickness for separation from God Amen from hatred amen is that right we'll find a out if you got the Cure let somebody come up and slap you good find out if you've been cured huh brother Braham said he had his mouth mashed all the time he had such a temper when he was young he would fight he would oh he was so little and he'd always get beat it sounds sound it to me like huh he' such a temper until man if he doesn't get cured he took down he wanted to shoot every one of them you think that man was playing no he pulled the trigger and it went snap oh and the man that once poisoned his dog anden he says I swore I'd get that man a't that right but after he got the Cure after he got the Cure he brought the man to Christ and led him to God how many knows we need some cure that black lady had a wreck amen and the somebody said hey me you want to sue for damages lordy no we don't need more damages we want some healing a't that right some fix them up that's what we need praise praise the Lord all right my maybe it's the devil telling me I'm not sure but something telling me you're going to have to tone it down or you won't be hardly preaching tonight if young people W people hear you I won't have any voice left so I don't know where that voice is coming from maybe the Lord but you know me I have a hard time holding back when we let go we just kind of let go we rely on the Lord to give his voice for tonight there it is if not we'll hold this up real close you can hear me now yeah yeah we'll make sure you can hear Mike and can turn it up so if you just amen a bunch and pull it out of me that'll be all right amen happiness peace joy in the Holy Ghost praise the Lord now let me get started let me get started on my thought first I want to take you to where my mind started off at way I begin to think about this and I thought about why I was thinking of why and I know what the prophet said about why and what he taught but I want to go a a a little different direction and that is I thought about the question on the song Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved the richet like me ain't that right when we've been there when I've been there 10,000 years huh bright shining as the sun we've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun and I ask myself the question after 10,000 years you ask me why are you still praising God huh why are you still praising God god well how many wants the answer because his grace is so amazing some people can't barely worship Him from one Sunday to the other they can't drive their sorry eyeses to church when church is open I don't know about you brother Troy but I'm looking forward to all of you I'm looking forward to hanging with you when we get over there and if I'm going to hang with you brother Daniel over there I'm gonna hang with you over here we're going to have Fellowship over here amen if we're going to worship God and for 10,000 years not have any less days to what sing God's praise cuz God is worthy of Our Praise he's worthy of more praise more more shouting more amens than what we have ever given [Applause] him that's why I'll still be worshiping him because I didn't let it get still I didn't let it get old never let this message never let the word become common to you like he told that church always keep it alive stay alive I'll just speak it as he comes would that be all right you ask me about a Bor after two weeks I thought maybe you'd have a hard time preaching I thought maybe you'd be little backslid why not I'm glad you asked me because the next scripture brother Carson I believe it's found in Isaiah 26 and3 because thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts in thee folks I tell you right now the more you think about your bills the more you think about your cares amen that don't do a bit of spiritual good for you and I'm learning folks I'm here to learn now I'm going to teach you again and I feel that this is something that the holy spirit is speaking to us this morning and something that's going to have to happen in each one of our Lives if we expect to go into Rapture all right because we all know that it is Satan's business to get you so busy that you don't have time for the things that are really important he'll get you so busy he'll get your mind so occupied until you have to think about everything else but him and I'm a minister Brad the Brad knows we know that we can get so wrapped up in things brother Brian knows as a Sunday school teacher sometimes we got to sit down and just begin to meditate say God where did I leave you at where did I leave off at now I'm going to begin to think about you because I've been thinking about my job I've begin think the work that I've got it on are you with me and we get away from God because our mind isn't stayed on God how many times in the Old Testament God told Israel to tie it on your bed post put it in front of your door think about it when you go to bed think about it when you get up think about it in the middle of the day he told Joshua he says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that's why you won't be backslid that's why you be a powerful Christian because what you put in here amen is what's going to come back out and we don't put enough in here amen a it not me the Holy Ghost I'm frustrated with myself with how busy I am amen before that two two days ago whipping around 300 bales of hay putting them up there over my head throw them up there and everything else amen un loading cars to did the second load un load felt my heart hurting I saido you better be careful you ain't 30 quite anymore huh that's right had to slow down take it easy me and my wife yesterday boy we just rested and took it easy yesterday cuz I said you know tomorrow I knew what I wanted to preach study a little bit the afternoon we just rest just take a day of rest we truly did do a no it's Sunday it's the Sabbath what am I thinking about r no Saturday's the Sabbath my mind ain't working right yeah really took a Sabbath we really took a rest amen by God's grace this morning no more pain praise the Lord praise the Lord but as I was saying so busy how many's busy so busy with the cares of life with the things of the world but I'm learning I hope you're learning if you don't get nothing else I don't care if you're sinner I don't care where you are if you'll turn your eyes on Jesus the things of this Earth will grow dim they'll grow less important to you church will become more important to you worship will become more important to you like my son was telling me last night he says you know the closer I get to God the more addicted I get to God the church to love the church to worship I thought that's right makes proud of Father proud when his children speak like that that's my son close to the Lord amen tell me all it takes to to grieve the Holy Ghost one Netflix movie it's all it takes just a little bit of the wrong it don't take much folks that's right God cares about everything you do he cares about everything you think amen and do no matter we have to work we've got to do our jobs but I've learned God help you God help me that even though we have to do that keep Christ on the Forefront of your mind see keep him thinking about him cuz when he thinks when you think oh brother B says when those three disciples coming from him they talked about him and when they talked about him it drew him near I'm here to tell you this morning if you'll meditate on him he'll come to you but we don't have meditation like should that's the word he used but Thou shalt meditate think about it think think about him think about all of his wonderful acts think about his goodness think about him and he'll take you like he does me to a simple thought of when we've been there 10,000 years why are we still worship Him we've got every reason oh my to still worship him and praise him for the most precious thing that there is that's amazing grace How Sweet the Sound 70 years what do we got here 80 years I don't know how much time we got left brother Urban and sister Martha we don't know how much time we got left but one thing's for sure not a whole lot not a whole lot the life that we have in the late these 80s probably won't be the greatest time of our life huh aches and pains and lack of energy lack of strength amen but to think try to think how long 10,000 years is 10,000 years amen that's a long time then brother Brad sometimes 12:30 yet 12:30 yet yet it's about time he'll close huh sometimes an hour and a half seems long to us huh folks I don't know about you but I think we I need to I'm more sensitive probably to that time clock than y'all are I am not picking on you I've gotten in a routine a habit certain time comes as a matter of fact 15 minutes I'm should be done should I quit that's it believe I will Caleb will why cuz we're going to do it throughout the ages to come we're going to praise him we're going to Magnify Him we're going to glorify him for his grace can I talk to you about his grace for a minute what do you mean his grace well first of all it was his grace that brought me here think about it there could have been a million in the conception of your birth it could have been a million others you know you wouldn't have been here but now chose you he chose you to be here Glory I don't know not everybody's glad to be here brother Glenn not everybody's glad to be here can I say something if you don't have a second birth it had been better for you not to been here better for you not to been born but God chose you one out of a million I don't know about you but that's worthy of a holler for me that's right he picked you to be here he picked you to draw a breath he picked you to have a spirit thank you Lord that's amazing W now how many would like to quad triple let's quad triple that and quad triple isn't enough Brother Brad I don't know what kind of ible it would be but when he chose you when he chose to put a burden on your heart to be saved when he put something in your heart that I want God I want the Holy Ghost there's more to life than just partying and having a good time having pleasure this that or the other I want more I want God God put that in you no man comes unto me except my father draw him young people tonight be glad if God draws you and when he draws you and when he baptizes you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he bypass seven billion people billions and billions of people he bypassed and he picked you now that's really amazing ain't that amazing that's really amazing So Unworthy of such Mercy amen I go visit my Amish cousins preachers Bishops first cousins just as homage to thec as they can be stuck in their religion you got to be homish you got to wear Amish clothes you got to do this out or the other can't have any more light huh yet I could have been stuck in there but he brought me out how many he's glad for his grace that's why that's why I'll praise him because of his Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I can see Glory brother B why are you always so anden why are you so full of the Holy Ghost why are you so refreshed I'll tell you why because I don't rely on local race I don't rely on Wednesday night I don't rely on Sunday

Ghost God himself among you I don't think I can find this but I'm at least going to try amen listen to Precious no I can't find it brother Ram talked about the presence of God you don't know how much

hurting oh my elbows hurting oh I tell you what there quit you griping Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord that's a better attitude to have no matter what kind of problems you have because in closing as you get older it's much much much easier to be crabby thank you brother Joe somebody's old and gets that way once in a while surprised my wife didn't say Amen on that [Laughter] one isn't Church good I love church don't you sure why we don't have to go out there to have a good time we come to the house of God to have a good [Applause] time we come to the house of God to praise we come to the house of God to scream and holler and do whatever you feel like doing last question I don't know how many times I said that brother Rad but last question why are you so quiet you see that was the question brother Glenn the question was why are you so quiet brother B why are you so quiet why can't you sit on your rocking chair on your porch or out on your barn just sit there let me give you the answer the reason you can be so quiet you don't have to have a lot of noise can somebody give me the answer well maybe I could give you a hint a small stream thin stream Rippling stream makes all kinds of right Rippling a narrow a shallow stream ripples a lot makes a lot of noise now let me warn you don't just take one quote and run with it because there's a not so deep stream might make a lot of noise but brother brandom also said wherever Jesus is there is a lot of noise so don't just go one way or the other but now the answer is at home we used to have to go grind brother Woody our corn and wheat put it on a wagon and go down there and have it mixed ground up you know but if you go with a box wagon oh y'all know where I'm going now is that right amen and when we go over them bump them up but when that was loaded it would just squeak a little amen it was quiet notot quieter so why are you so quiet because I'm loaded are you loaded Are You full Are you full of the Holy Ghost so then guess what whether you sit there and you're quiet or whether you scream and holler as long as you're full how many wants to be that way amen Lord help us to be [Applause] full full of good stuff how many wants to be full of good stuff all right we're going to close God bless you this morning amen when I begin to think about why are you still praising God after 10,000 years I begin to think of all the reasons how many believes we have a lot of reasons that way we've been there a million of years so my warning to you is don't let God don't let the message become common to you the answer to this is the easiest way for you to let it become common is to get your mind off of it to get it away from it just a little bit between Wednesday and Sunday get away from it amen by Saturday you're like wow I've gotten away from God don't do that keep your mind on God keep focused on God it's the worst hello and I've learned by God's grace I hope that you can learn from my lesson amen that that if you begin to think about your work it doesn't have to be sin it can be simply the cares of life so busy like that Methodist woman so busy that she got a bunch of stuff on her that she didn't need to have amen amen let's stand I want to tell you this morning that what we have here as the prophet of God said is very precious when you've got a church that is alive you've got something that's very precious now what I want to say is when you've got families dads that are alive you've got something precious when you've got families that are alive in Christ you've got something precious not just about the church because that's what the church uh what makes the churches families let's all make sure that we are very alive and I hope that we that this will be such a blessing and it'll change your life that whatever percent whatever you're giving to God multiply it amen think about him when you're driving down that road and when you every minute did you get extra that you ain't got to think about your job or whatever say Lord here I am I'm doing this business but God is more important that I do this business deal and reflect you than it is for me to Big make a big profit or whatever isin that right always keep Christ in the Forefront that's what our Bible taught us that's the message that Spirit spoke to us this morning I believe I hope we can take that and go home and be different because the time draws nigh amen bow our heads Lord Jesus as we bow our heads now I wonder how many this morning would raise their hands and say I am I don't think like I should I don't think on him as much as I should and from this day forward I want to pledge myself that I'll keep my mind stayed on him God bless you God bless those hands my hand is up Lord Jesus every one of our hands no doubt should be up but we ask you to bless those hands that have been raised Lord and help us God that you would be so much more real to each and every one of us Lord that you truly would come and make your Abode and do special things I know that you will that whenever people meditate upon you Lord you'll come your presence will come down in their hearts and their lives and change them forever Lord we ask God that you'll bless each one with a closer walk with you now in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen praise the Lord turn your bibles if you will we'll go into the communion part always in honor to take the Lord's Supper isn't it because this is what he asked us to do commanded us to do in remembrance of him because if it wasn't for this here and what he has done how many knows we wouldn't be here amen doing what we're doing and having the freedom in our hearts and the joy in our hearts
