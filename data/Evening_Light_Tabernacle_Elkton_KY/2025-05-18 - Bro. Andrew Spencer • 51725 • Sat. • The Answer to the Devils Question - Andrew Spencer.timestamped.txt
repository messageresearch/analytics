[49:26] everything behind
[49:29] me and I found a
[49:31] God who makes all things
[49:37] new. I looked to
[49:39] you cuz I was drowning in my
[49:45] questions. And I found a
[49:48] God who holds all

[50:48] you and I was wondering in the
[50:53] shadow and I found a
[50:56] God who
[50:58] relentlessly
[51:01] pursues. I hid from you cuz I was
[51:06] haunted by my
[51:09] failure. Oh, but I found a
[51:12] God. Though his grace still covers
[51:17] me and I fell on
[51:20] you when I was at my
[51:25] weakest and I found a God.
[51:29] You're the lifter of my
[51:33] head. I've worshiped
[51:36] you. Oh, I felt you right beside
[51:41] me. Lord, you're the reason that I sing.
[51:46] Cuz you're the God of all my days.
[51:54] Each step I
[51:57] take, you make
[52:01] way. And I will give you all my
[52:08] praise and my seasons
[52:12] change. And you stay the same.
[52:18] And you're the God of all my days.
[52:25] And in my
[52:28] wories, God, you are my
[52:32] stillness. And in my
[52:36] searching, God, you're still the answer.
[52:41] And in my
[52:44] blindness, God, you are my
[52:49] vision. And in my
[52:52] bondage, God, you are my
[52:57] freom. And in my
[53:00] weakness, God, you are my
[53:05] power. And you're the reason that I
[53:09] sing. Cuz you're the God of all my
[53:16] days. Each step I
[53:20] take, you make
[53:25] way. Oh, and I will give. You are my
[53:30] praise.
[53:33] And my seasons
[53:36] change and you stay the same.
[53:42] And you're the God of all my
[53:48] days. And in my
[53:51] blindness, God, you are my
[53:56] vision. And in my
[54:00] bondage, God, you are my
[54:05] freom all my days.

[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:18] Talk about throwing to the wolves. I
[1:00:20] sent my sister a song here and I didn't
[1:00:21] know if she knew it or not. So, we're
[1:00:23] going to go with something
[1:00:24] safe. Amen. How many come to praise the
[1:00:28] Lord tonight? Amen. I like that song the
[1:00:30] sister just sang because our God, he
[1:00:32] comes in in the most the most unexpected
[1:00:35] times. Amen. And the times when we think
[1:00:38] it's impossible, that's when he starts.
[1:00:41] Just sing this with me. Well, victory,
[1:00:45] victory shall be
[1:00:48] mine. Oh yes. Victory, victory shall be
[1:00:53] mine. Well, if I hold my peace, let the
[1:00:59] Lord fight my battles.
[1:01:02] Victory, victory shall be mine.
