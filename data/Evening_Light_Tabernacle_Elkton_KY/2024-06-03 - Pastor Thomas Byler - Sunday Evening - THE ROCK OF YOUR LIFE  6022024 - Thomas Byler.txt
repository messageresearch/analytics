that I the lord gave me this morning amen but I felt like I wanted to amen preach that one this morning and then this one this evening amen all right so here comes the Young Folks right first all all the Young Folks maybe Braden and Woody's kids how many who who can we get to come on up here amen right there's one huh all right all of you young chaps come in come on up as far as you can amen praise the lord it's all right they don't have to but they can if they want to they want to be with Dad Dad that's okay amen dad have to sit with him he wouldn't he amen praise the Lord God is good isn't he how many appreciates our young folks my my my amen amen let's just the scriptures and we'll get started let's turn to Matthew 16 if you would Matthew 16 me I I titled it the rock of your life the rock of our life amen and so amen 16 and 13 all right that's okay when Jesus Come into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist and some Elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight I'm going to say a lot of things that we've heard before amen but and it may seem kind of like of a deep subject talking about Revelation to our young people amen but the thing of it is amen it is the thing that is the anchor for your soul so it's very very important amen amen I've got wrote here you know the first thing about young people is that you should be thankful if God has given you Godly Parents amen because your chances of turning out right coming out right uh having a good life uh or ending up being alive hello are greatly increased because you have Godly Parents amen because there's only two things that's going to happen in in your life amen you're going to end up living forever or you're going to end up in dead death how many believe there's only two paths one is to life and one is to death amen so if you have Godly Parents be thankful for Godly Parents amen praise the Lord because we just PE kids nowadays don't realize uh that if you don't have Godly Parents and I will say this that probably different ones of us have seen even people that have left the church here parents that have left God left the church amen and there kids are scattered and there ain't no telling what they are amen amen so if you don't have a rock am me church is a rock of your life amen amen to come to church and because that's where you find out really what The Rock is isn't that right amen so praise the Lord I want to just read you some a few things the importance let me talk to you about the importance amen of that rock but let me let me just say a few more things here amen young people as you get to be a teenager as you get to be a teenagers and you go through times of uh you have a lot of questions you have a lot of whse why this and why that why do we have to do this and why do we have to do that there's a lot of things that you're not going to be sure about maybe yourself lot of insecurities a lot of unsureness a that right and it's a whole lot like what happened in the Garden of Eden now at one time Adam and Eve they were in perfect life they never had one question they had no wise no ifs no confusions of any kind am that right but after the fall amen we realize that they we went into darkness amen and then I want to try to try to get this to you that life is about you being able to say oh I see oh I understand now it's kind of like your parents or your teachers trying to teach you a certain problem that you have and you can't figure this problem out you don't really know what you know how to solve this problem but that teacher will tell you well you put these two together you put them together and all of a sudden the light comes on and you're like oh yeah I know how to do that you know and it just all of a sudden you light up and you understand it and that's what the whole Christian principle is is about having the eyes of your understanding come open amen and your parents you know in the spiritual realm in the spiritual realm there's things that your parents can never teach you they can tell you intellectually is that right they can intellectually tell you or the pastor might intellectually tell you but there's things that has to be done and showed you by God himself and really that's the only thing that's going to be an anchor for you that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen you are like a ship each and every one of us is like a ship on the ocean brother brandham talked about it when he was flying over top of this ocean and there was a ship down there amen and the storms were coming and hitting it ain't that right and you're going to have storms in your life you have all kinds of things that you got to overcome amen boy I'm jumping around now I haven't finished my story of the Garden of Eden but anyway uh storms will come questions will come hard times will come but he says you know if that that boat it would sink it would actually maybe turn sideways or whatever and flip over and those waves would actually cause that boat to sink and he was asking of somebody beside and he says what keeps that what keeps that ship from sinking he says well it's got a sea anchor right right it's got an anchor amen how many believes you got to have an anchor but you got to have something that that anchor holds on to and I want to call that you know that you've got to have an absolute in your life if you don't have an absolute then look at out there at Walmart go to Walmart and look at what people look like when they don't have an absolute they have been flown over and and flipped over so bad their brains have flipped huh the guys don't know if they're a girl or girls don't know if they're guy and they get mad at you if you tell them that you know they've lost their mind you've lost your mind if you're listening that's exactly right if you don't know if you're a boy or girl you have done went insane come on folks we won't get personal about where you need to go to check and find out but I'm here to tell you it's about time somebody knows which side of the fence they belong on Amen it's pretty simple really they want to have debates and all of this other stuff but pretty bad though they're tossed no telling and then you come to the age brother Paul brother Daniel you all come to the age Gideon all of you that right right now you know who your anchor is where's your anchor right now well once you come to the age of accountability it better be Christ but as long as you're with your parents you may not have the Holy Ghost but how many's heard they'll be your Holy Ghost for you they will be your answer for you they will keep you uh from having a phone if you don't need to have a phone because they're going to watch it make sure that your mind doesn't get corrupted they're going to give you security they're going to be there to help you if you fall down if you hurt yourself and you're are protection is there by your parents your anchor is your parents there even your Holy Ghost so to speak until you get the Holy Ghost but there comes a crossroad time ain't that right let me go back before the crossroad a little bit after Adam and Eve fell see brother bam said that in the age that we're living now ever since the fall we have been living in this is for us adults a little bit we've been living in the nighttime how many believes it's dark it's actually dark time it's like overnight everything went dark so much so that even the genetics of the trees and genetics of Adam and Eve changed from never getting old now their genetics changed to where now to get old is't that right all of the Animal Kingdom of the trees everything anything everything death came in when that curse is lifted again those genetics will change how many is looking for a genetic change for that curse to be lifted but we're living in the nighttime anden it's Darkness everywhere it was so dark Adam one time didn't know what to scary Amen in the night time and uh uh you know even as you think sometimes well I'm not sure Mom I'm not sure dad your insecurities and your unsureness and and maybe your condemnation but part of that darkness is condemnation part of that darkness is guilt just being guilty is a terrible thing just having a guilty conscience is a terrible thing having condemnation in your life then there's fear of judgment there's fear of death is that right it's a terrible World scary and spooky world at night why do you think people are so scared of the night oh Mommy I want to sleep with you I'm scared of the dark right why because the night is scary amen and I want to talk to you a little if I can take my time but there's been several times that God has amen that there's been a rising of the Sun that there's been a day that light came again brother B even Illustrated talking about how that men always feared death you know and it was kind of a Spooky World and everybody's got all these superstitions and basically a lot of religions still have their superstitions is that right Catholicism especially Amish ISM also all of that they have their Superstition you know like there's going to be when you die you know you're going to uh you know they go to purgatory and all of this other stuff and boy they were real smart weren't they if the give the preacher some more money he'll pray a and get your relative out of purgatory now there's some money hungry preachers right there isn't it that's exactly what Catholicism was and John Martin Luther broke away said Christ paid for my sin you know and there ain't no Purgatory this is Purgatory brother Bram said a purging where you purge yourself and get clean and so forth how many believe that but so for the longest time for thousands of years it it was a Spooky Night amen people and people's heart was dark see young people you're either going to live in darkness or you going to live in light amen see Isaiah 60 says arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people oh yeah we got light out there looks what do you mean light we mean it's all dark no in the spiritual well there's gross darkness in other words it's the darkest just before the day brother bam explained that right now it's darker than it's ever been so much so that he said that he said in this Lea age do you see any light in there I believe this spirit said it's complete it gets goes completely dark here amen when what what does that symbolize it symbolizes that the holy spirit is lifted the church is gone no more light and then he goes for three and a half years to Israel isn't that right so they get a little bit of light God says put a little bit of sliver of light in there put a little slivering light in there when them prove prophesy then it's total darkness amen so what is this Darkness this darkness is in the minds of the people this darkness is in the hearts of the people amen just like let let me just amen I'm GNA take my time okay I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit basically I want to talk to you a little bit with the help of the Lord about the importance of Revelation the importance of it amen all right where we at here notice he says in the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculpture unveiling his work of staty exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering amen an uncovering amen and Enlightenment just like I said once uh it is something that has previously been hid now it's made known now it's shown it was covered over now it's unveiled it's to take the cover off of something amen how many knows that the God has to take our children and he has to open their eyes he's got to take that cover off mama can't do it Daddy can't do it preacher can't do it only God can do it and their choice it has to be their choice amen he reached that crossroads amen but so he says listen it was an unveiling or an uncovering is what he called it Paul he said that when he preached the gospel that Christ made known what is his secret and so forth he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he purp in himself amen even predestination according as he has chosen Us in him from the foundation of the world he begin to uncover the whole plan of God for thousands of years people didn't understand what the whole plan of God was but now it's made known how many knows even the seals Jesus Saidi have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when the spirit of Truth is come he will lead you and guide you into see so there's always a further a more uh a truth coming out amen praise be to God Amen brother brah says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to the True Believer can never be overemphasized that's right it means more to you than perhaps you realize not just the Book of Revelation but I'm talking about all Revelation it's very tremendously important to the church how many believe that if Revelation be on you look up and seek God for it amen that's the only way that you're ever going to get it a revelation has to come from God it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual end demment he says and you can't you can even memorize the scripture and though it is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation of God Amen and the Bible says that no man can called Jesus to Christ but by the Holy Ghost amen and when you receive the Holy Ghost then and only then can that Spirit give you that Revelation that Jesus is the Christ and he says we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world wo more than anything else in the world young people you need to ask God for Revelation in other words make these things known to you amen sister Sher she needs a revelation or has it that hey I'm Healed God has healed me God has to personally Quicken that to you anybody that's sick no matter what it is if you're a sinner and you want to get filled with the Holy Ghost you pray God give me a revelation sometimes we call it a Pentecostal experience sometimes we call it a personal experience because it does have to be a personal experience and God doesn't have any grandchildren your parents ever so good and every all that they teach you and that's wonderful and good and you ought to obey him and listen to it but you pray young people you pray for Revelation see God out I want you to reveal yourself to me cuz in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and he said let there be light and there was light brother B says listen to this he says uh he says the only light that we can live by today in the church is God vindicating the light to this generation he says there was growth Darkness upon the Earth fog and Mist upon the Earth and God said let there be light now what if that light would not have come brother Place one place he says that was not even light when he said it until it was manifested and that's the way it is with you and I old young whoever we are amen it's never a reality to you until it's made manifest and that's what we pray for God make yourself real to me I don't want it to be on the pages I want it to be right here I want my healing I want my salvation I want my Victorious life I want the baptism I want it all to be a revelation God personally revealed it to me brother Brad a couple weeks ago talking about man you know we we get the new birth we think that's it no there's still 600 some promises in the Bible am Meen let's come on come on God I want more I want more reveal all of your promises to me you think your natural knowledge of the word is going to overcome the devil no just your natural understanding isn't going to do it that's why you pray young people you pray God make yourself real to me let me get on my prayer bones and say God make yourself real and then if he fills you with the Holy Ghost and you believe that you're born again well then don't stop there amen keep praying say God reveal yourself more to we need me we need Revelation every day just that little revelation of what God gave me for this morning I mean that was just yielding to God and saying God reveal yourself more and he'll take that little bit and oh he'll just set you on fire with it anden it doesn't have to be a great thing quit looking for such big things young people listen to that still Small Voice that talks to you it'll tell you so I'm I want to encourage young people listen to that still Small Voice us older Po Folks be good off too to listen to that voice ain't that right listen to that still he'll Quicken it to you ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find so when you ask be expecting something because it's coming he keeps his word knowing Jesus died for you that's wonderful but that has to be a personal revelation to you amen pray for revelation we need to call on oh my listen than anything else in the world we have accepted the B the great Bible the truth of it we have accepted the grace truth of it but still it's not real to most people because the revelation of by the spirit isn't there now I don't really like it when preaching just come up here and say no you know you say say I believe it I accept it into my heart that don't do you one bit of good but yet brother bam says if that's all you can do that's what you do because guess what before a seed can Sprout you've got to take it into your heart if the word says it you say I believe that I accept that if it's just mental take it that way take it that way until God makes it Quicken to you because one thing sure you ain't getting it if you're not accepting it amen no you'll never get it if you don't well I don't know if it's for me or I'm just going to wait till God reveals it yeah you're going to wait till God reveals it but in the meantime believe it with all of your heart amen can't be overemphasized us parents how many of us parents would say I want my children to have a personal experience with God that's saying I want my children to have a personal revelation I want God to personally reveal himself to your my children cuz no matter how much you say no how much you've taught them it's all in vain if they end up going down the wrong road and if they don't get a personal revelation sooner or later it's all going to be in vain because there's no anchor there the anchor of your life is that personal and the reason I wanted to focus on children more is because it doesn't matter if it's Paul it doesn't matter if it's Moses every person that had a personal revelation they were children in the eyes of God they were just children it's just the start of God revealing himself to them how many knows when Moses he ran he was a coward and everything else and he tried to do it himself and it didn't work but when God talked to him on the back side of the desert he was not afraid to go into Egypt and if you want to kill those great big giants that you're going to face in your life and you have have H 10 times 100 more times the Temptation the trials and the tests that we had when we were growing up ain't that right our kids face great opposition and anything outside of a real personal experience isn't going to do I was listening to brother bam he said you know that black brother moose I believe his name was down in the South amen he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and his boss said you know Moos I I need some of that I want I want to get the Holy Ghost sometime you know when I get a time and I'll I'll call you and I'll let you know so one day he called Moses I want to get this Holy Ghost he says here's a corn crib the Corn's all God good nice warm dry Place let's go to Corn Crib most said nope that's not how you going to get it okay well let's go up here to the hay Mound and we're going to get up in the hay Mound oh it's just really nice here you know we can just lay back on our backs and pray and say thank you Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost M said nope can't get it that way don't come that way' and they went down around to Pig pin he said there was Waller I guess about need most waited up in there waited up in there slashing around come on in here he says well I don't want that he says I didn't think you want it in first place huh how many know you got to go you got to be willing to die to yourself amen you got to make that choice I want to serve God that's one of the most important things that you got to do when you get a little bit older you got to decide what you want to do you decide who you want to serve is it going to be the god or the devil because you're going to serve somebody and you're going to go down a road that's either a hell Road or it's a Heavenly Road and you got to make that choice amen and you lay aside everything else and say God I tell you what now right now Lord Mom and Daddy's going to find me dead laying here until you fill me with the Holy Ghost you got to get real serious about it when you get real serious about it you watch God come and change your life in 1906 I think one of the leaders of the Pentecostal movement he said you know the people would come up and they would want to know whether they got the Holy Ghost he says if you got a question whether the Holy Ghost then you ain't got it I thought it was pretty good no you ain't got it if you have to question whether you got it you're going to know that just something happened you're going to know that you have been changed you know that those sins have been forgiven you're not the same man not the same woman that you was before not the same boy not the same girl it don't matter if you're young if you're old you have got to have that personal experience with almighty God cuz it's the only rock that your soul will ever anchor on there'll be Hypocrites in the church there'll be Hypocrites in your neighborhood Mom and Dad could be a hypocrite this my might be a hypocrite but none of that self will shake you if you have a real experience with God hello your preacher could fall let's just get personal here but if that would happen if you're a personal revelation to God that won't shake you either why because your experience isn't known whether a pastor stays right amen or a preacher or your mom or your daddy or your grandma or Grandpa amen that's not got nothing to do with you amen one amen anyway isn't that right you got to have a personal experience why you think I'm standing here folks I don't go by nobody else in their experience or what what people do or don't do got nothing to do with it you love the Lord tonight that's right amen back to the light you see in Ephesians the next verse he says you know he says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened wo isn't that right the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that's what opens up I think it was Jesus if I'm not wrong he said it this way he says blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears for they hear why because those folks they can't hear nothing because they're in darkness it takes God to open up the eyes of your heart the eyes of your understanding amen because their hearts and their ears and their eyes have they closed amen because if your eyes ever come open to it I believe it with all my heart believe it with all my heart and God opens it up and baptize it with the Holy Ghost then you can truly say I once was blind but now I see all the preacher talks about peace that passes understanding oh I wonder what that's really like joy unspeakable and full of Glory oh I wonder what that's really like but you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you get your mind and heart set on him how old are you now Paul 15 see I was only five years older than you five years older than you when God did a work in my life I said God here's my life take it and use it for whatever you want here I stand why because God came down and he did something give me a personal revelation of himself by coming and accepting my repentance amen this morning you seen him up there getting baptized and most of them in shorts huh one man was over there praying for somebody else I think and I was kind of feeling bad the man was shirtless in my church I said I didn't catch that but shirtless up there and I'm like nah no I just can't see God accepting all that huh let them go in with tattoos Living For The Devil and let them go to heaven and make you live straight life make you watch every thought that go through your mind bring it all into captivity while they can I don't think it's G to be like that do you no without Holiness no man shall see God you come God's way or you don't come and they're going to knock and knock and knock and try to get in and weary themselves well I went and I got baptized but it didn't work so I'll go back to my devil worship like I was here yesterday huh weary themselves to find the door but be glad young people that you've been you've been given the light amen you're not in darkness we're not in darkness what is that light when something's made real I'll send you Elijah to Prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord when he comes and opens up amen and says if I haven't told you the truth amen don't believe me but if I do and Jesus comes and vindicates it it'll be sin for you to disbelieve how many knows the light that has come was Jesus Christ coming and even having his picture taken the pillar of fire so you don't have to be in that oo I'm Methodist I'm Baptist I'm Pentecostal which one's going to be right who's going to make it great big Steeples and churches and oo the days of Miracles is passed you know you have to be in darkness you don't have to be in sadness you don't have to be in sorrow you don't have to be scared you don't have to wonder you don't have to qu you can know because the light is really bright amen arise and shine for thy light is come the eyes of your understanding has opened folks I would still be wondering which Pentecostal church I would belong in I watched uh the Pentecostals reunion the other day the preacher was up there I guess he was the overseer of it all and he had 14 preachers to come up and they were reading their articles of Faith 14 articles of faith I believe it was and one was you know we believe in the resurrection and we believe in uh the saving of the Soul we believe in all kinds I'm well that's all scripture come on down the other preacher said we believe in baptism in the name of the father son and of the Holy Ghost the other preacher said well why we believe that the speaking in tongues is the initial it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost brother brandham talked about them guys amen why do they do that where does the bible say that you're supposed to have those type of Articles nowhere so they're unscriptural all their articles are unscriptural repent all of you for doing unscriptural stuff just believe the whole Bible go up there and say well guess what why wasn't anybody ever baptized in the titles of the father son the holy ghost in the Bible not one person but would do you think that would open their ears do you think that will open their eyes no they're so stuck and he was talking about yeah I know that bad stuff has coming Among Us yeah I know people say that we're backslid but I'm not worried about us not making it because we've got 14 articles of Faith amen and this next convention we're going to confirm that thing again and this that and the other amen I thought wow that's where they have went to that's where they are still suck in the same place they were way back then when the truth is presented their eyes don't come open amen Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see you I want to see you blessed are your eyes for they see can you say this this evening the Holy Spirit what is the holy spirit I see what the holy spirit is I see what the Holy Spirit does because he's doing it in my heart brandom and Paul said no man call can call Jesus the Christ but by the Holy Ghost you don't know him until you have it your heart you just intellectually know him but it takes diving into the pool to get wet takes diving into the water to feel the temperature of it otherwise you're just saying that's water hello praise the Lord God is good isn't he but the light came in Paul's day the True Light Came ain't that right the Bible says the true light has come and it's shining into the hearts of people but then guess what happened we went down into some more Dark Ages didn't we Dark Ages until Martin Luther had to fight for every inch of ground that he got had to stand before that Pope and say I can't reject those articles I can't reject what we believe the just shall live by faith I can't in good consant to it the light was starting to come out ain't that right starting to be born again coming back forth and all the Palmer worm all the caterpillar all that those Dark Ages amen and all those worms that ate away from the truth all of a sudden it comes back to light more light comes Pentecostals come but then what happened the very life of Jesus Christ came and manifested himself in a man so much that people and thousands of people thought well he's Jesus you might be critical but whence the last time said man you you do so many of the works of Jesus you discern the thoughts and the sents of the heart you do everything raised and dead are you Jesus I don't think any of us had that problem people say they want to be like Jesus I want to be like Jesus that was the closest man I've ever known to be more just so close to Jesus until people mistook him for Jesus he was so yielded he was just my brother but he was so yielded to the holy spirit that he could do the very same works that he did when he walked the shores of Galilee and a lot more isn't that right amen then people have a problem when you say you follow brother brandom let me tell you something I follow brother brandom let me see how that makes you feel I wonder how that makes the people feel out in the other oh I don't know if you should do that well would you follow Paul he was a prophet of God and he said follow me he preached the church follow me as I follow Christ amen that's exactly right I ain't got to worry about brother Bram not following Christ he followed Christ God trusted him so much he came to such maturity on a spiritual level that God could trust him a't that right that young couple's misbehaving on the front row kissing each other and all over each other and terrible lwd and everything else and tells him to stop that now you're in the house of God go get you a room or something go get out of here this is not the place for that huh wouldn't do it wouldn't stop the Holy Spirit say whatever you want to him say whatever you want to him and it'll be I don't know about you brother bad but we're Believers we believe that whatever he'd have said would have happened whatever when that when that uh those boys came to uh sister Hatty Wright right ask what you will I ask for my boys and you'll have it in your lap where did they go to a bench no they came on her lap gave their hearts to God whatever you say you see folks I don't know about you but I'm still looking for that maturity in me I want to get to the place the prophet was so close to Christ so close to God that he can trust me with the spoken word and not speak them out of existence not judge them and cond condemn him but I forgive you I forgive you for that brother witty I want to see the tape plate back I'd like to see the tape plate back of how that couple reacted after he said that I'm very curious I'm very curious whether they left I'm really very curious of whether there was such an aura power of the Holy Spirit come upon them till they were about half scared to death and straightened up and sat still or just what happened I don't know amen but it was a tremendous moment brother Tommy it was a tremendous moment it was a life death can you imagine being that couple and say God just told me that whatever I say to you it would be I'd imagine I'd have been been scary that's right but he did the right thing didn't he he didn't do like Elisha and curse them children because they called him a Baldhead was mature brother Brandon wasn't but he cursed them children and 42 children were killed by a few she Bears few bears come out and kill them what did Brother Bram say he said the parents huh them kids think about the kids them kids died because their parents were disrespectful around the table able about the man of God hello you got parents that are disrespectful for the man of God how do you expect the kids to be it got them all killed Lord help us we're thankful for respectful parents aren't we kids be very thankful when you go home and you go to praying tonight you thank the Lord for your Godly Parents thank you Lord Jesus for your Godly Parents [Applause] they lead you and they guide you amen want you to have a personal experience with God Amen I want you as your pastor to have all of our young kids you know how many young people came through the line and took communion professing Christ that's nice to see amen but you know brother Brad I love long to have more more Revelations from almighty God God I know there's so much more of you you're a great big God and I know there's so much more how many of us adults are the same way say God I need more Revelation from you I need more Revelation from you Lord give me more Revel he says we need to pray for more Revelation more than anything else in the world because it's the what gives you the personal strength he says the we know the truths of it but the word hasn't been quickened to us and that's what we ask for Lord Quicken it to you make it alive to me I'm saved I'm forgiven I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I'm a Child of God every day that I go and I face the pressures of life I need him to reveal himself and speak to my heart how many loves when he speaks to your heart says just little things it's real sacred it's the best thing that can you can have just comes to mind I was going to close right now but comes back you know the one thing about a ship it has to have a compass that Compass points to that North Star and it's like that one has a it has a guide a guide another illustration of that brother Braham gave of of us is going through a wilderness ain't that right A wilderness we don't never know we don't know we don't know the way through these Wilderness the woods is too vast life is too vast it's too complex just to be able to go by yourself He said Out West you can't go hunting by yourself you have to have a guide you have to have somebody that knows what he's doing young people you have to have a guide in your life that guide is the Holy Spirit Mom and Daddy do a good job now but someday you're going to have the the holy spirit to guide you to lead you amen not that you don't now you do but as long as you're with your parents they're going to watch over you amen they'll assist you listen you have questions ask your parents if your parents can't answer it you're welcome to come me say Hey Brother B and I don't know I'm pretty dumb but I'll do what I can to try to help amen but one way or the other we want to get you through we want to get you through this alive not dead in 10,000 years from now we're g to be happy we're going to be alive in 10,000 a million years we we say that but do we really comprehend that in a million years we're so going to be alive it ought to excite us wow cuz you got a eternal life Pursuit of Happiness is only found in Christ you don't have to wonder how or where Christ has come and made it real to us and showed us the way the Wilderness you got to have a guide to guide you through it I was 16 I worked for a Mason laboring and at noon I love the woods I love the streams at noon brother Glenn I went for a walk I went for a little walk through the woods and before I know I was lost I climbed a tree to find out where I was and it didn't tell me nothing so what I do I got down and I just kept walking until finally got a road finally ran into a road remember brother braham's story of going on a death walk around around without a guide but anyway I found a road and come all the way back and I think it was around 3:00 half hour before I quit the bosses were laughing at me they were nice they were laughing at me I said where they said where you been where' you go I just I kind of went for long I got lost oh my but that's just just a short little walk oh I I ain't going no but I

you ain't getting out of your seat in vain you ain't doing it for nothing God sees it and I believe God's going to honor it I believe guess what I believe that whatever you ask it be given to you so I believe something's going to happen this week that's going to draw you closer to God how many says amen how many's with me something's going to happen God's going to reveal himself to you in a greater way can you imagine what we have need of brother Joel we don't we don't know what everybody has need of all different things right but the thing of it is he does right I don't know but he does so we're going to ask God and you just think about it and say God I need more of you how many needs more of him I need more of him him and he's going to you only get more of him as he reveals more of himself to you Lord Jesus we come before you bowing our heads listening to your Prophet that you Vindicated that said that we should pray for Revelation more than anything else in the world and that is for you to make yourself more real to us Lord father we ask God that you would forgive us because we know that the toxins there everything's been provided Lord there is more of you to be had but sometimes we're still a little bit too much in our own way in our own self perhaps we're not listening quite close enough to that still small voice but we have come and we've assembled ourselves

Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you can be seated in closing before Brother David sings a song or two I want to say brother Bram said Faith was a revelation he said the new birth is a
