break my head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities our bones are scattered at the graves mouth as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth keep me from the snares which they

they're they're lays ahead for the believer and the unbeliever for the unbeliever it is the most horrible time that you could ever imagine that right but for the believer it's the most glorious time amen and i believe you and i are facing that isn't that right the glorious time for the believer we don't have to be down-hearted isn't that right we don't have to be depressed we don't have to be sad and sorrowful because amen why because we don't have our hopes here in the first place if you have your hopes here while you're certainly in for a real depression amen but we're not looking for that we're looking for the glorious time of our lord appearing amen and and taking us out of here so god bless you this morning it's good to be not back in the house of the lord trust everybody's having a good summer so far we don't have much of it left i guess so amen maybe another six weeks or so amen so amen praise the lord enjoy the sun while you can amen praise the lord let's just bow our heads and go into the service lord jesus we come before you this morning thankful hearts once again to be able to assemble ourselves together father lord to see our brothers and sisters to fellowship one with another to be around one another lord jesus and just to be able to see each other father and then also lord to fellowship god which around the word which is more important father to be able to bring ourselves before you lord as job the bible talks about job going to the house of the lord to present himself before the lord lord and we we are here lord for you to look at us for you to check us out for you to see if there any be any ways in this that is not like you and if there is lord that you would take it out father and to prepare us to get us ready for the lord meeting you to see in

to your divine grace lord we thank you father for this opportunity and ask for your strength now in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord amen i always you never know i never know just why the lord takes me in the ab in the directions that he does but we always trust that it's for the best and it's the lord isn't that right amen we enjoyed ministering wednesday night i just liked the little thought the lord laid on my heart amen about reaching up to those things sometimes that's a little hard to get amen and getting a step ladder so to speak in climbing up to receive those things that god has for us speaking about where david said you know bless the lord o my soul and all that's within me amen and forget not all of his benefits amen the benefit of being a christian we spoke on is wednesday night amen and so amen we're going to try to we're continuing to try to improve uh the quality of our internet service and so forth so i don't know if that's going to help me when you've wired it directly this morning and then it's going instead of going on wi-fi but amen um you know so i believe you know i don't know if it's like brother branham said you know if you might not get the whole loaf but at least you get a slice of bread amen you might not catch all of it because it might not be streaming the way you should but i'm sure if you listen close it'll be a blessing so we greet all those out there amen on the internet watching this morning so praise the lord god is good amen turn your bibles if you will to saint john saint john we'll go to saint john the fourth chapter and begin and i want to speak to you with the help of the lord on revival would that be okay revival and the importance the importance of revival and what revival does amen amen i truly believe that it is important to stay in revival all right saint john 4 and we'll begin with verse 7 there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy me then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew asked us to drink of me which enemy woman of samaria but the jews have no dealings with the samaritans and jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith unto thee give me a drink that would as buddhists have asked of him and he would have given thee living water amen the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then has thou that living water are thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus answers and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life may god and his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen i think that last verse i wanted to go one more it says the woman said unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come here to draw amen how many knows jesus always had a reason for doing things amen and you know i don't know just what it was but there was a reason for him to be there and to be there and he actually sent his disciples away amen and then this woman came out to drink you know i just thank god that he knows those that are his how many believes that this morning amen how about you this morning how many remembers the time that the lord came your way aren't you glad that the lord came your way amen and stop perhaps and waited and was right there for you amen and spoke to your heart amen amen and i like this you know because we begin to think about revival we know that the bible talks about how the unreadable tells us the story of that spring isn't that right that spring that uh was always bubbling up it was always bubbling up and happy and and the better be asked to spring some questions about why it was always so happy why it always had so much joy you know was it because i come to drink from you or the deer come to drink from you amen now how many remembers brother baby says that the christian we as christians ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth we ought to have more joy than anybody and i don't know about you but i believe that the things around us the cares of life the you know because somebody knows that the more cares of life that you have the more you have to worry about those things isn't that right and worry will bring depression amen and so we find that those things they don't bring us joy like they're supposed to amen well they're not even supposed to because the lord he is the one that truly brings his joy but the more the more you get weighed down with cares a lot of times the more this unhappy people become they don't have the joy like they should have amen and i don't know about you but i'm sure every one of us here this morning would admit you know that i really could use more of the joy of the lord amen i believe one place uh uh you know and and what was it i've had it wrote down here but i think some of the pre-service music was even went along real well with what we were we were going to speak about amen but so we think about that and how that he's better bam talk about that thing and he says you know it wasn't anything that anybody did or anything from that well but it was something down on the inside that was coming forth praise the lord and jesus promised this woman and he was there and then he specifically asks her for a drink now how many knows jesus was the fountain he had the water amen that you could drink up and never thirst again and not only would you never thirst again but if you drink this water you become the fountain how many believes that you become the fountain this water that you drink will be in you amen a well of water springing up into everlasting life praise the lord how many know blood says that god really hates a powerless church amen it's called dead church he really doesn't like that god doesn't like death i don't think anybody here likes it amen none of us like to be spiritually dead amen we don't like to be naturally there we don't like amen to have things just to become common to us i mean that's what happens a lot of times if people things just become common to people all right so let's just think about this so he says here it'll be a a well of water bringing up into him an everlasting life and i want to i want to take my my theme pretty much my theme quote that brother bannon makes and if you don't mind i want to just read it to you and uh maybe before i even read it i think of this quote brother bam talked about mr reed head i believe it was which was like the head of the main religious realms back then in his time and out of how that mr redhead he got into a conversation i'm not sure if it was on a plane or somewhere along the way and he got into a a conversation with a muhammad and they got to talk about mr that this mo this mo this man he began to ask him and tell him you know you know you your religion believing in the bible and jesus and so forth you know he says you know our founder you know he claimed that we would have joy and we would have resurrection and so forth you know but your founder jesus he claimed that the things that he did you would do also and he said you know he says let me see him do that and then we'll believe that he's actually risen isn't that right so he got into the conversation like that and and attacked the end of the conversation brother man says mr reed had tried to kind of switch it around and brother branham called it a loophole and he was trying to get out of this conversation he was having with this man because he was very smart intellectually and he couldn't he couldn't defeat him and say well we got salvation and we got joy and we got happiness and he the other guy's at the same thing we got all of that also he says well you know he says you know us better scholars have learned that from i suppose you're referring to mark 16. and he says you know yeah that's what i'm referring to as muhammad did and he and and he began to tell them you know that we have learned that you know mark 16 from about the 14th chapter on it's not inspired and so but better than the more he says he didn't he but didn't like that at all he says he should have referred it to somebody that it did have faith to believe that you know and we well of course we know what happened later on we realized that brother branham he ended up going to the sikhs of jains and all of those and he says now i've come and paid respect to y'all will you come to my service and they all said they would we all know what happened there isn't that right that's when thirty thousand mohammed's and all of them guys got converted and so forth but he said talked about mr redhead and how that he says you know we learned that it wasn't inspired from there on east mr that muhammad and said you know what kind of bible do you have because you know if that part is inspired not all of it is inspired what part is inspired and he was really defeated in his conversation now how many knows you can't just take inspiration out of the bible and say this is part isn't good and expect god to bless you you you can expect defeat when you begin to changing the word of god god put it in there ain't no man got the right to take it out how many please say ain't nobody got a right to say this is inspiring this is in this part the bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of god and he's profitable doctrine for reproof for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be thoroughly furnished isn't that right so that's what the scripture says and so but he says that and then says what a defeat that it was and then he makes the statement again i believe that all of this is inspired how many beings did every word of this is inspired amen and i want to say this morning i truly believe that we need that inspiration to strike us that's the most needed thing in the message today is for this word that we have to strike is and for it to be amen inspiration to come into here because it's a seed form but the water has to fall and quicken that seed isn't that right so the story goes like this brother bam says i remember standing up there it was by lake michigan and i was just a boy preacher i went up to hear paul raider amen to preach at the world's fair i'd like to hear paul wouldn't you about 1933 i believe it was and it was at chicago and i had my first opportunity to walk out there and look at a large body of water oh mine and uh and it was just a jumping and going on you know and it was early spring easter sunrise service we were there and i see those great big white caps coming in you know and they hit the bank and they'd roll out and i thought oh my floods of joy or my soul like see below's role amen how many has had that experience sometimes you know it doesn't matter where you might be when you begin to think about the lord and the lord begins to let that spring come forth i mean it's like floods of joy amen flood your soul like a sea bellow it becomes rolling and rolling and rolling in amen how many needs more of that and i thought they roll in but that's not the end of the wave it goes back to roll again and i thought what's it all jumping about and something just seemed to say to me it's having a revival that's all well i thought you know what he said there's not one speck not one more drop of water in that place in that lake he says it than it was when it was perfectly quiet he says there's no more water not a bit amen did you ever think of it but it was just having revival just jumping screaming shouting having a revival and i thought well what's the use of having a revival now i read another place and i was listening to several different messages brother bam talked about he says you know it's not in my ability it's not in the preacher's ability or in a person's ability to produce a revival that has to come sovereignly by god but the only thing you can do is get in the place that god can use you to bring a revival amen how many you see you know there's a lot of people think well i sure wish my church had a we sure need a revival no maybe you need a revival let the revival start in you how many would say that this morning lord start a revival in may now sorry to say but most of the time because i believe that as a christian if you're staying tuned up the way that you should stay tuned up with the lord you are in a constant revival how many wants to be there but i'll tell you right now you know sometimes we get backslid a little bit amen into revival kind of he begins to dim out in that right and we that's why it's called the revival because you want to revive what you have already that's what revival is it's something that you have already but it just needs stirred up it needs revive bring back to life amen and i believe that's what people around the message need today is they need to have it revived to bring it back forth back to where it was before all right so now notice let me just get down here to our punch line here what's the use of having the revival oh my he says there's a wind that came down how many believe that's what needs to happen a wind needs to come down something needs to happen a rushing wind you know as we believe it and begin to stir it up what's it stirring it up for and i happen to see that all the trash that was out in the lake it washed up on shore so that's what a revival is for it's to wash out all the trash glory how many beefs that's what the holy ghost does amen when a revival begins to stir in your heart amen all the bad attitudes and all the fussing and all the bickering and all the attitude not all just washes away that's what a stirring in our hearts does you ain't got to worry about the things that are wrong the things that are not good it'll all wash away whenever you have a real revival in christ jesus when the word that we already have amen how many believes that brother bam says you know that that rapture ring faith lays in the message already [Music] it's already there praise the lord and as i got thinking about that this morning i begin to write some things down amen that is in there already we don't need new word huh we don't need another prophet let me say some strong things here is that okay we don't need another prophet i guarantee you if we would need another prophet he'd already been wrote about in the bible and we would have another prophet israel needs another prophet but i believe god is what says that last messenger he has sent that last prophet amen and that's going to have us ready it's what's going to make us ready i want to tell you this morning i believe that the dress is in the closet you just have to go and put it on i think we got what we need we just need to put it on hey man it needs to be a reality in our hearts [Music] and that's where the lack is is people it's not a reality to people this word is not a reality to people amen and what does it do if it's not a reality that means it's dead to you i want it to be alive praise the lord hallelujah all right so we're going to think about that here a little bit more about what all is in there but he says you know it washes out all the trash that's what revival is when he gets stirred up and then it washes all the different things away praise the lord and i got to think one thing you know you know the world you know oh my how many remembers and people are talking about defunding the police right they're talking about defunding the police you know i got a revelation here this week amen brother bannon talk about defunding the police thank you brother steve is that right and he told us how we can do it how many wants to know how we can get rid of all the cops i got a revelation i thought i remember brother brown said you know let everybody try to make jesus their example isn't that right get filled with the holy ghost like jesus was full of the holy ghost and you'll be able to dismiss the police force all right hallelujah i think you'll be able to dismiss the police force you would have to you could get rid of every marriage counselor you wouldn't need them anymore if everybody got killed with the holy ghost amen they're so revival that would break forth until the word of god was so real to them let the water of the holy ghost come down on you this morning and i can tell you man you might be the most stickery person hardest to get along with stick here and stick there but brother brown said let that water come on down let that gosher begin to gush out and undull and those stickers that mean person that you all will make you bloom with like a flower it'll make you soft it'll make you gentle it'll make you kind it'll make you understanding it'll make a man treat his wife right it'll make a wife treat her husband right isn't that right that's what the holy ghost would do not only can you dismiss the police force but you can dismiss the hospitals we can dismiss our deacon board because they're the ones that are supposed to keep ordering the church is that right somebody get disorderly that's right there's not going to be brother absolutely everybody get filled with the holy ghost it won't even be one fuss that wouldn't be one fuss why because the holy ghost don't fuss even paul said if you want to argue about whether a woman ought to have long hair or not we're just not going to fuss about it leave it alone brother brown says don't fuss with one another don't get in family fusses amen the holy ghost will take care of that what you need is a revelation a real real refreshing of almighty god and your soul and those things will go by the wayside you won't have to beg people to come to church and make them playing cards they'll be faithful no they'll can't wait for the doors to open to get in there and praise god just a little bit more i'm going to tell you right now the more of you get of this water the more you want the more you thirst you want more you want more all the time i want you to know it's joy unspeakable and full of glory we got people and i'm here to tell you people are losing their joy people are losing their happiness you haven't got the joy like you used to do you don't have to smile on your face like you used to do think about it and if you aren't what you used to be then you need a revival you need a stirring praise be to god let that water let it become a reality to you you'll come alive how many knows this water it brings life for the word of god is quick that don't mean fast huh that means alive you as he quickened who were once dead incense and trespasses how many glad to be alive amen peter like that's all because he's alive he's alive he's alive and i'm forgiven heaven's gates are open wide now we can sing i'm alive i'm alive and i know the resurrect of jesus christ amen our joy the joy is not there with people anymore they don't have that deep unspeakable joy in their heart that deep crusher that comes forth let me tell you something yesterday's experience isn't going to do for you for today yesterday's goalie washer's not going to do you for today we need it to continuously flow how many believes we need a flowing of that word in our lives continuously slow because so many times i'm telling you right now there's a lot of times that people amen they get stagnated the water just sits there hey how many know that if you stay at a certain plateau in your christian life it won't be long before you get moss backed muscle begin to grow the pastor and the deacons and everybody oh my moss green moss amen moss back brother talked about a moss-backed christian not enough water flowing to clean that all out how many knows that they're flowing stream keeps all of the wiggle tails off it keeps the mouse out just the flowing it's just a rippling isn't that right just a falling down stream and cleaning it all out that's what we need for that word just to kind of continuously flow in our life how why do you think better than pray for revelation more than anything else in the world why because it's what gives you power over the devil is that word it's being quickened to you it's a reality to you and i don't care what portion it is the word of god is inspired every word of it is inspired amen praise the lord all right let's go on if you think about it you don't need any more water we've got all the water that we need brother branham is preaching your spiritual amnesia in birmingham alabama and he goes to talking about he says birmingham you're receiving your last sign remember thus saith the lord did you ever hear me say that but what was the truth you're seeing your last sign that's scripture you've seen your last sign pentecost don't you get it mixed up now with what israel and what's going to happen after the rapture that isn't you you've done you're done then now is your day now is your sign but even one place he says you know i'm reading in the papers and the different ones are saying amen the revival has come but the revival is coming he says no it's not it's already come it's that out now it's dead and you're never gonna see one it came and you didn't know it right in the middle of malachi 4 they were saying they needed to need it they were recognizing the need of the hour but they didn't recognize what was happening around them now is your sign now is your time don't reject it don't do it you better come you believe me to be god's servant remember birmingham i've never met nicer people huh you're the nicest people i want to meet in my life they were very nice southern folks is that right but listen to what he said but you need a revival you're dying you're taking spiritual amnesia you're dying don't do that revive what you got bring it back up again quickly before jesus comes amen how many believes that's what we need to do say god make it alive make it real to me once again lord like he did with samson's you know his absence me begin to cry out just once more lord just once more lord i may be a slave but not just bring me that again and he did it one more time and destroyed more than he had in all of his life praise be to god i believe that how many believes the bride's gonna be in revival when jesus come because she's not gonna be dead she's not gonna be sleeping she's not gonna be lukewarm i believe she's gonna be hot amen i believe it but i want you to know the way i feel about it this morning is i want every word i want to not just be inspired but i want to be inspired in my heart in my life in your life because otherwise it's just sitting there doing nothing amen praise the lord expectation brother makes a statement blah blah blah says you know we're expecting god to do something for us we're expecting him to do something first he says women don't be like the world or dress like the world or be like these modern things and all this stuff that they're doing keep away from it you're a daughter of the king and gentlemen you're brethren you don't have to be beat down and pushed off in some corner i mean believe that you don't have to live a defeated life you don't have to go around with the blues huh you're sons of the king stand up with your chest out we're expecting god to do something for us and he can't do nothing for us when we're just all drooping around like something about half dead lord help thomas father i don't want to walk around amen like i'm half dead why because god doesn't like dead things i don't like dead things you don't like dead things we like it alive how many thought to be alive and there's only one thing that'll ever give you the spark of life and that's the power of the holy ghost jesus christ it's the only spark the only thing it'll absolutely get it going listen to what he says now notice he says don't go wrong about and i was listing this i thought boy this is good he wants a lively church are you with me the pharisees they didn't like a lively church you know how many churches out there that if you got two alive they'd throw you out huh you had to say amen preacher in some churches they would throw you off amen probably the army church i come from you say praise the lord you wouldn't last very long no they would throw you up because why that is not something they like the pharisees remember when those people were seeing jose hosanna glory they were worshipping the lord oh my brother says wherever jesus is there's usually some noise people don't even have emotions anymore people are so dead they didn't even have emotions what did the problem god say about emotion if your religion doesn't have a little emotion in it you ought to bury it it's dead you know right amen praise the lord and we all how many dogs we all express ourselves differently amen we some of us cry we just i see sometimes people just sit there and cry and raise their hand others are like me and they're loud and boisterous and amen their speakers should speak out and hallelujah amen we can't expect one to be like the other but just express yourself to almighty god praise the lord how many is glad this morning amen god wants a lively church he wants the members in there to be lively stones built up into a house of faith amen peter he says he says in uh first peter 2 and 5 he says ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by christ jesus oh if there's anything that we desire this morning it's the worship that we do bring before the lord that it is acceptable when we come on sunday when we come on wednesday then our worship is acceptable almighty god now let me ask you this what kind of worship is not accepted what kind of worship god don't like huh well it's called becoming common remember there's a kind of worship that you can have there's a kind of things that you can offer to god that's a stitch in his nose your tables have become full of vomit and so forth he says you know and brother branham he makes the statement that they did exactly what they always did but he says he came to church they offered sacrifices they sang songs they sang amazing grace perhaps but they did it out of tradition huh that's the kind of worship god doesn't accept that's what he doesn't like it's just a formal common thing so what does that tell me this morning that tells me that when you worship the lord it needs to come from your heart from way down on the inside it reminds me of the story brother damn told of a friend of his that was going to work you already might remember this story he was going to work and i'm not sure he's why him and his wife i think we're kind of spatting about something all right i gotta go love you honey bye give her a little kiss give her a little hug give her a little kiss went on up the street and begin to walk up through there right and he went up there he didn't begin to think you know what if i don't make it back what if i don't see her when i get back and so what does he do but says he goes turns around walks back in and he says he never even said anything is that right from what i understand no no i'm sorry me and you would be said honey i'm so sorry i uh you know i snapped at you we do that sometimes don't we brothers yeah got some honest brothers yeah and he didn't do all that but he came back in better bounce as he walked way back in the house and there was a little corner there and then and there she was crying [Laughter] i don't know if i should say what comes to my mind but maybe not oh my our sister should be sensitive right not so hard that you slap him or something you know that's what but sensitive you know and the brother should be sensitive too you know right but sensitive and she was like you know that's just not quite right i'm so sorry you know she felt bad about it he come back in she now know that oak opened her eyes and said honey you came back yes honey i came back and this time she gave her a big old hug and that right and gave her a kiss said all right honey i love you i'll see you later and he says you know it was everything was the same but this time it had feeling in it and that took care of it all because it had feeling in it and i believe that's where our lord is this morning our worship and our praise to him it needs to have feeling in it how many believe we need more of that this morning lord i need to have more feeling about my religion i need more have more feeling on my feeling my prayers when i pray to you in the morning lord i want to have more feeling in it why i want it to be genuine i want it to be a reality in my heart in my life i need a revival lord stir it up again amen restore unto me the joy of my salvation folks just tell me this story again i don't need my word but just tell me about the amazing grace of almighty god and i'll sing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the reds like me it might be the same old story but it's the greatest story and it'll never grow old should never go old to us how he believes that i believe the word of god should never grow old amen and you know god always he always stirs it up and he gives you a little bit more a little bit extra with it i mean it's the same word but it just gives it more feeling more meaning how many believes this morning that the word of god you need the word of god to have more meaning to you more meanings amen because it's there it's all there all of the word of god is inspired amen whether it's salvation how many believes that when you really get a revelation that jesus christ saved you when he quickens that to you it'll change you from death to life amen salvation it's in there in this book let me tell you how many believes that rapturing faith is in here salvation is here healing isn't here the rapture is in here how many knows the rapture is in here no wonder china and russia and those places they don't allow this brother caleb i believe in him brother was joe's head and then i was reading about tale of him and over a pastor there in china that's in prison because he's preaching go to prison for it they claim that this is very detrimental to their kingdom and it is this is the most dangerous thing to the devil there is you get this book right here into the hands of the people huh and you can cause people to become so that they're willing to die for this and that's dangerous for the devil why because it's inspired how many believes it this book is still inspired every part of it is still inspired yeah not just part of it every part of it even the cover even the first the second word on the front it's inspired it truly is holy this book the devil doesn't want to they don't want it because it'll inspire people to believe it'll save people it'll change people's lives and they don't want their lives changed they like their people to be puppets uh sheep so to speak uh their sheep but it's inspired this morning think about it i think about it how many believes that the resurrection is in here the res direction is in here as brother would have said this rapturing faith in the message i say this morning there's rapture in here i want to tell you something i believe those tapes are inspired how many believes it i believe every word i believe those tapes are inspired oh i believe it that's why i listen to him as much as i do that's where a lot of times i get my inspiration why because he preached the bible he's malachi 4. why wouldn't it be every word is inspired how many believe you're inspired this morning let that inspiration oh my whenever that inspiration strikes devils flee amen david how many knows that that word become inspired to david and goliath felt it when a knife began to cut his head off oh yeah he was he maybe wasn't quite dead yet maybe that stone amen he was just jerking around whatever but they wouldn't cut his head off make sure the job was done whatever your inspiration is like there's no telling there's no there's no limit to the power of this word when it's under inspiration in the heart of a person for the bible says the word of god is quick it's alive i mean believe this is alive it's quick and it's powerful sharper than any two-edged sword amen it goes all the way to the mar the bone and he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart this word is so powerful that it'll tell you what you're thinking and we've seen it manifested in this hour it's alive brother it's alive praise be to god and listen what else it does over in ephesians i want to read another scripture this water how many beliefs that were washed by the water of the word you know we're living in the age brothers and sisters a real real filthy age that right a dirty age and i'm sure that every one of us as we live here that this flesh this flesh if you aren't careful it wants to take on dirt this flesh likes the third of the world if you just let it go just a little bit it isn't long before you get dirt on you we're supposed to stay clean hey how many believes you got to say clean we'll take a shower or what once a day we'll wash our hands before each meal isn't that right we'll wash our hair three times a day take a shower every day amen to stay clean and i believe that even in your spiritual walk in the hour that you're living in you have to be careful to make sure that you stay clean and we get washed i believe that this word washes us it makes us clean it revives us just as amen that spring that's springing up on the spring it keeps that spring clean you don't see no wiggle tails in that cold water no they can't stand it in there not no real springy water and that's the way it has to be in our life in ephesians 5 25 we'll begin with um verse 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it praise the lord gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word how many believes that woman at the well was filthy she was dirty having five husbands she had to come out there when nobody else came because nobody wanted to associate with her nobody would come out walking with her no company you keep you know and so she was so dirty that he had to be there at a special time and what to do when she believed that word is that right it washed her it made her clean and that's where it is with you and i that's why we love to come to church and hear the word because as you receive it you see god take that away from me lord i know what i ought to be wash it away wash it away let it begin to just boil up and wash me clean i'm not what i was last year i'm not what i was last month i'm not what i was last week because the word is washing how many thankful for the washing of the word but you get away from that word huh it don't take long to get all dirty amen amen let it wash he gave himself forth that he might wash it by the washing of the water by the word amen praise the lord it brings life it washes it makes clean amen birmingham i mean no birmingham needed it they needed revival they needed a cleansing they needed the spark of the holy ghost they need that revival man to wash that thing out amen keep it clean that's what the church is for this morning that's what the word is to do to keep us clean praise the lord and to give new life when you begin to find yourself getting kind of cold on god find yourself getting a little backslid you don't have the joy of the lord you don't have a amen anymore a hallelujah can't drive down the road and just tears begin to come to your eyes thinking about the things of god and how good god is and pray for your brothers and sisters amen how many knows that's what the holy ghost does when you get enough of the holy ghost you begin to pray for the church you begin to pray for the people you begin to pray for your friends and begin to reach out and even all of these things that's what the word does it brings life back into you why because listen there's only one kind amen that's ordained to be able to do that because there's so many that are dwindling out doesn't bother them a bit never to come back to church doesn't bother me a bit to just go out there and live like that but you know the bible talks about an eagle isn't that right how many knows the evil it'll go through a moping period huh it'll go through a moping period those eagles they'll get so old and they'll get weak they'll get scales over their eyes they get all hardened and they can't hardly catch food anymore but you know the bible talks about how that and i've been told that these eagles as long as they'll keep eating you know right keep eating food keep eating the word amen that eventually those scales will fall off am i right and they will renew their youth praise the lord how many believes that's that's what happens to us as a christian oh my i don't care you know i love the joy of the lord but think about this that 80 year old man brother talked about going up there and preaching and so forth amen he had renewed his youth amen in other words you feel strong again you feel young again not just young and naturally but i'm talking about young in the lord amen exuberant for god an ego has the genetics it has the ability to renew its youth through the eating of the word of god amen how many islam for that would we be if it wasn't for that tell me being able to renew ourselves how many know sometimes between sunday and uh another sunday or wednesday and sunday sometimes you'll you'll get a little bit cold on god but we come to church raise our hands we come early and pray and say god i need my youth my youth renewed lord i need to be on fire for you how many believe we all need to be constantly on fire for god always in love with the lord never let the thing become cold and old and stagnant because that's not acceptable to god it's a stench in god's nose when it becomes common to you lord give us a revival how many is with me this morning lord give us a revival and he can only do that as we surrender ourselves and as we completely give ourselves say god here i am take me lord bring me a revival lord amen praise be to god god is good isn't he boy i'll tell you what after god does it doesn't matter how defeated moses might have seemed on the back side of that desert hiding out when god give him a fresh revelation of himself he wasn't afraid to go down to egypt and said let my people go amen david he wasn't afraid when he got that revelation that hey you know that guy he is defying the armies of the living god amen he came forth and he says i'll take him on he became strong because of the revelation that god had given him because of the water that flowed through if there's ever a time brothers and sisters that we need that strength it's in this hour because this is the age when amen when if you aren't careful it isn't long before i mean even something as simple as perhaps an attitude and that right might jump on you or just a little the word but he makes to say he says the word don't mean as much as to you as it used to god doesn't mean as much as you used to why because you've gotten too close to the world amen got a little dirt on here got a little got a little bit too cold on god god doesn't want a lukewarm church he wants you hot for him praise the lord how many is with me see god just keep us hot for you amen god bless you this morning stand with me if you will musicians if you'll come lord help us to be lively stones amen alive in christ that only comes through the word being a revelation and fresh in our lives amen praise the lord this morning amen let's bow our heads this morning go before the lord and say lord jesus we come before you god this morning god realizing that we can't bring revival ourselves it's something that the holy spirit has to do but father i pray god as we know that every last one of your words every one of those words in the bible is inspired and we believe that one of these days god even the rapture father that rain will come down the holy spirit will come and he will anoint that into the hearts of his people so much until god will be standing here and will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye why because it'll come down there and it'll just bubble in our hearts and in our souls father and you'll quicken that word by your spirit father but i ask god this morning lord jesus that you'll quicken the word father that we'll be hot for you that we won't be lukewarm but we'll be on fire and we'll be hot for you lord jesus that you'll lead us that you'll guide us lord jesus and it'll be all a real reality to our lives father your precious word father it doesn't matter which portion of it is lord whether it's needing overcoming whether it's need the baptism of the holy ghost lord salvation or whatever it might be lord i pray god that you'll bring more revelation to our lives lord jesus on a daily basis that we would be on fire for you and that water would come up from the inside of our souls bubbling up into everlasting life lord lord jesus and that will be lively stones worthy of representing you worthy of saying that we are a christian lord forgive us of where we failed and come short of your glory this morning we just thank you lord jesus for your great grace and for your mercy this morning that keep us ongoing lord jesus and that keeps us pressing the battle father for we know that battle certainly is heavy in its hot lord but so are your children roared preparing themselves and presenting themselves before you say lord make me worthy of your kingdom lord jesus and continue to bless lord jesus with your presence like never before inspire all of your word to us lord jesus this morning and father if there's anyone that has a need lord jesus may they just raise your hand say lord you what i know what i need of i needed that this morning because i need more that fire and my spirit lord i ask god that you'll bless every hand lord that's up lord every heart guards that bowed before you say lord jesus here i am i've be let it become common i've just come to church and it's just become common and i don't want that lord i want it to have feeling i wanted to really i want to meet it with all of my heart god father my relationship with you is not optional it's not something that's just lukewarm but lord we love you with all of our heart mind soul and strength we ask for your continued guidance lord for this church for every person here lord continue to raise up lord those that are not feeling well those that have back trouble lord jesus and we thank you for the praise report we thank you for all you do among us for we know that you work miracles among us
