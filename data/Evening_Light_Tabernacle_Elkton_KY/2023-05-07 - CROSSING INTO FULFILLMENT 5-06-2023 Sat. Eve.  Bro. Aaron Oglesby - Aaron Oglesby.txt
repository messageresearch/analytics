you're away from home to have a little bit of home with you amen so I don't I don't want to keep you standing too long tonight so we're gonna get straight into the word and and um we're gonna be turning to Genesis 49 but but before we do that if you don't mind let's let's go ahead and empower heads and talked the author of the word but before we get started and and just put the service squarely in his hands tonight hey man Heavenly Father Lord we bow before you humbly tonight Lord recognizing immediately Lord our insufficiencies recognizing Lord that with that I have nothing father Lord that I could do or say Lord that would Bless the people and strengthen them Lord but what I'm depending on tonight Lord is that you're going to come and that you're going to take control and that you're going to anoint the vessel father and Lord in so doing that you can take these words or you can break them up and however you see fit to meet each and every need that is represented here tonight father Lord so we just humble ourselves and commit the service into your hands commit the word into your hands and ask that you'll have complete preeminence now father in the name of Jesus we pray amen and amen we're so happy to be here good good to be amongst old familiar friends and new friends meeting new people it's just it's going to be good amen God bless you verse 1 of chapter 49 and we are going to read a portion down through verse 19. it says unto Jacob and Jacob called unto his sons and said Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your father Reuben Thou Art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power unstable as water Thou shalt not Excel because thou want us up to thy father's bed then defile us thou it he went up to my couch send me in and leave our Brethren instruments of Cruelty or in their habitations oh my soul come not thou unto their secret unto their assembly my honor be not thou United for in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel I will divide them and Jacob and scatter them in Israel Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judah is a lion's whelp from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he counts as a lion and as an old line who shall Rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a law Giver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be binding his foe unto the vine and his ass is cult unto the choice Vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes his eyes shall be read with wine as teeth white with milk Zebulon shall dwell at the Haven of the sea and he shall be for a Haven of ships and his brother his borders shall be undesigned on is a car is a strong ass couching Lord At His blessings to the reading of the word um have another couple of places I want to read from but I want to go ahead and allow you to take your seats tonight I want to look at numbers 32 and 1 numbers 32 and one we're going to read down through verse 5. it says now the children of Reuben and the children of GAD had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazeer in the land of Gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle the children of God and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses and unto Elisha the priest and under the princes of the congregation saying adiroth and daibon and jazir and Nimrod and hezbon and elilah and Siobhan and Nebo and Beyond even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle wherefore said they if we have found Grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over Jordan what you're seeing here is after the the journey across the uh across the Wilderness after they had been delivered from Egypt they actually get right up to the crossing over Crossing into the promised land and Dad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manassas aside they don't want to go in and the reason they don't want to go in is they see the land on this side of the Jordan and they say it is more suitable for cattle and we have cattle and if you do a little bit of research what you'll find is that accumulated these flocks in the journey so what I want to make a point we're here before we move on is listen we may accumulate a lot of things in the journey we may be blessed in a lot of ways here on this Earth but don't let that hinder you from crossing over don't let that stop you from going on into what you've been called to possess tonight you will understand amen so then we're going to look at one more place and it's just one scripture it's Matthew 1 22 and it says this now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying now I know that seems like an odd place to stop so saying what but but the point of that is a phrase right there in the middle of the verse there in Matthew and it's and it really strikes me and it says that it might be fulfilled that it might be fulfilled it says this phrase 11 times in the Bible in reference to events taking place and um whether it be Kings rising up or very specific things happening on the cross or Joseph and Mary going down to Egypt it's a phrase that says all of this happened that it might be fulfilled in other words no matter what God's word is going to be fulfilled this circumstance and this circumstance and this circumstance all of those things were happening leading to a fulfillment of God's word don't let it get out get you out of cater today God's word is going to be fulfilled amen you believe that and that's what we're going to preach to you a bit tonight Crossing into fulfillment Crossing into fulfillment because nothing is out of God's hand tonight nothing is out of hater nothing is out of order brother Bradham said God spoke it it's got to be so that settled in heaven forever it's already said he says they don't argue about it up there amen it's already settled we argue about it but in glory it's settled When God says anything it's got to be well is it that wonderful hey man I'm thankful tonight that he's not a Fickle God that thinks this way one day and this way another and he said by my stripes you're healed that still stands tonight if he says that the promise is unto you and to your children and as many as the Lord Our God should call that still stands yes tonight and forever amen we know that that fulfillment brings faith in other words the more things you see fulfilled it builds your faith up when when you see by my stripes you are healed fulfilled in somebody's life it gives you Faith to believe it for your life when you see that the promise is unto you under your children you see someone's child receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it builds up Faith to hold on for your children when we see fulfillment it builds up Faith amen it elevates our faith to believe for more not only in the sense of believing for things like like healing and victory but but but looking at world events through a different lens looking at world events through the word and looking through faith in his word it will completely stabilize you as a Christian if we'll take what's going on around us and look at it through the word tonight it'll bring it'll bring a stabilization people get so shook up and so shook by the things going on in the world they get so shook up by Russia or so shook up by the economy or so shook up by the evil of the politics all around us so shook up by the Sodom condition and then I want to ask like what is it that you were expecting I look at those things and I say it's exactly what the prophet said was going to be it's exactly what the word said it was gonna be it was foretold right here in the Bible it shouldn't Shake us it should make us recognize it's been fulfilled and if that's being fulfilled then there's a bride on the Earth today that part's gonna be fulfilled don't let it shake you make it let you look up and say I know that my Redemption draweth now don't let these things shake you look at them through the word tonight and you see something and it may be evil but you go yep knew that was coming yeah I didn't know that was coming that didn't shake me that just confirmed to me once again that this message is the truth hallelujah the word foretold it listen even for us as Believers the end times aren't going to be Rosy end times aren't going to be easy but we don't have to be scared of them we don't have to be worried about it because I'm looking for their fulfillment so when I see these horrible events I can take them and place them in their proper place I can place them where they're supposed to be what is it what does that event mean brother Aaron what's it mean Russia's doing this and the Sodom conditioning in this lgbtq and then what what does it all mean it means I'm one step closer to going home it means I'm one step closer to getting out of here it doesn't shake doesn't ground to say it's happening in church we're right there at the crossing over Hallelujah someone is going to cross into fulfillment in this day the world has to be in an end time condition we thought a few years ago where 10 years ago we're 20 years ago however long you've been following this and man and I believe in Christian that we just we thought we knew how evil it was going to get yeah 20 years ago we thought it was going to get evil but I don't think I didn't see how quick it would happen y'all was telling somebody the other day I said when I was a kid we had a president by the name of Bill Clinton who at the time was considered the liberal of liberals it didn't get no more liberal than Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton's time the Defense of Marriage Act that said marriage had to be between them a man and a woman and he was the most liberal president we'd ever had that guy would be like a right-wing conservative nut now do you realize how far things have come just in the last 10 or 15 years if we're here another 10 or 15 years oh God help us but you know what if we are that's okay because you said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you and I'll be in you even till the end of the world we're still here so so is he he's still fighting for us he's still going before us he's still safe and he's still healing he's still delivering he's still making a way through the Wilderness we have not been left alone church but he's gonna make sure somebody crosses into fulfillment Hallelujah brother Brown says look at all the televisions and things getting these fictitious things in order it'll come a time I predict that people will be completely totally insane the world will be fulfilled [Applause] he says the Bible speaks of such hideous sights as they show in movies today of some prehistoric creatures eggs that lived in the Earth for so many thousands and millions of years hatch and come forth he said that's just a minor thing that's what's going to happen and when hell is open and the Devil comes out with all these mysterious things locusts with hair like women teeth like lines while the world will be completely and totally insane it's not just but about one degree from it now that was in 1965. I'm afraid sometimes we become too conditioned to our surroundings because we'll look back to 1965 and go man I wish it could be like it was then and he looked at and said it's insane now we get two conditions sometimes we get two conditions but listen it's not a message of Doom and Gloom brother Brown would say to us he said too many times we point to how evil the world is getting he said and we're failing to see all the time how powerful the church is getting at the same time listen if there's a world in the end time condition if the tree of knowledge has reached its apex if there's a people sitting there ready to be Atomic fodder then there's got to be a people on the Earth a bride of Jesus Christ in the end time condition ready for a Rapture Ready for a body change ready to cross into fulfillment it's not just them in an end time condition you are in the end time condition I am in an intight condition oh but what about the anointed ones at the end time that's me it's not just a falsely anointed ones at the end time but what about the true anointed ones at the end time anointed to take a body change in this day Hallelujah but we look too many times through Earthly eyes oh I see this one struggling I see that one falling away I see this church splitting that one preaching false and and I see this one attacking this one you're looking at the Through The Eyes of circumstance who look at Through The Eyes of circumstances look through the eyes of the one that said I will have a church without spot or wrinkle I say it all the time but I look at that scripture and I go brother brother I'd mess that scripture up by myself but guess what it's not up to me to fulfill it it's not up to me to make it come to pass he said I'll have a church he said I'll have a bride he said there'd be a Rapture it's up to him to keep his word all I gotta do is trust in it tonight believe in it tonight it's his word it's his promise you're his people he's gonna bring it to pass in this day hallelujah hallelujah I didn't make the promise I didn't say it he made the promise he made the promise and someone is going to fulfill it too many times we look at these events and we want to see the Fulfillment of them but they're not characterless events in other words it's not just an event someone has to fulfill it someone it's not a kiss not just an event it's an event with a people for the event it's not a characterless event somebody's got to do it somebody's got to look away from circumstance Abraham looked away from circumstance and he looked away from his body now dead and he began to look to fulfillment there had been a word given Abraham and he knew this will be fulfilled because he looked at it through the promises of God let's take our eyes off the circumstances of the world tonight and bring them back to the word of God let the word be your filter don't don't allow yourself to to miss God because we view him through our circumstances don't allow ourselves to miss God because we look at him through hours of Flesh you know brother Branham says and I'm not quoting here you can go find it though he says that that Sarah was in a foul mood that day he said she was really in a bad mood but listen he was determined that she's the one that's going to bring forth the promise son and I don't care how bad a moose she is I'm not gonna let her miss it and he's telling you tonight you may have had a bad day you may have had a bad week you may have had a bad month but who is it that's gonna bring the promise son back to this Earth this Brown's gonna do it and he says I'm not gonna let you miss it but I have come down Hallelujah to wake you from your doldrums to pull you from your bad mood to pull your eyes back to the promises tonight brother Brown says if we don't watch Friends the church is going to fail to see it let's not look he said let's not look for church hairdos and new dresses let's look for the Holy Spirit to come in the Supernatural and raise some things he says the church don't need a facelift it needs a verse the Holy Ghost to come into the church and bring back people that believes in the Supernatural and holds on waiting for the coming of the Lord Hallelujah because many times God is in things and we fail to see it because of the eyes we're looking through you know we look through herd eyes sometimes we look through scored eyes we look through eyes with complexes come on we we look through eyes of doubt eyes of fear you know and sometimes let's be honest sometimes it's just tired eyes you ever try to read something late at night y'all just keep you're just tired it's hard to focus look I understand I understand the battle's hard we get worn down we get tired but they that wait they that wait upon the Lord maybe you're in a waiting period maybe you're wondering when's it gonna happen when's my turn Lord I've been struggling I'm like listen don't waste the waiting don't waste the waiting the waiting is for a purpose in your waiting talk holster in your waiting seek God in your way and get ditches in the valley I'm telling you there's water in your Valley there's blessings in your Valley your strength's gonna be renewed your blessings are going to be poured out but in the waiting don't waste the waiting but seek God like never before Hallelujah we look through the wrong guys but tonight let's begin looking with the eyes of I know it's going to be fulfilled I don't know when but I know I know it's going to be fulfilled and as the Royal seat of it Abraham it's going to be fulfilled in who it's going to be fulfilled in me quit putting it off on others Sarah because it's not it's not the slave girl's job to bring forth the promise son quit pushing it down the road on somebody else they can be blessed they can have the Holy Ghost their kids can come back these blessings these promises this Rapture it's for you Sarah it's yours tonight Sarah look who has a faith it's my Rapture it's my promise it's my Holy Ghost Hallelujah Hallelujah we got to start looking at these situations in our lives as opportunities for fulfillment come on we don't welcome trials I'm not like another one yes but when it comes it's the opportunity that Wayward son's an opportunity for you to kill the fatted calf sickness is an opportunity for you to experience healing and for this Satan Satan that's attachable body to be cast down no I don't want to be sick but when that comes my way this is my opportunity for God to rise up in my life for God to rise up and for his enemies to be shattered it's my opportunity to face a Goliath in my life [Applause] I'll never forget when I found out brother Ron Spencer had cancer and I just texted him a little thing Tim I was praying for him and he writes back and he says Goliath has showed up so now we fight come on now those are those 20 people hiding in the tents there's plenty of people like Saul I don't want to come into the valley but when Goliath shows up for your promise when Goliath shows up for your children when Goliath shows up for your health it's time to go down in the valley and say this is my land these are my children these are my promises and I'm here to take them back get off my land get out of my Valley Hallelujah Goliath shows up it's time we fight Hallelujah we got a good looking at it just as I want to see it fulfilled but I want to fulfill I want to fulfill what I've been called to fulfill Hallelujah the time has come for the Fulfillment of all of God's word brother random says now you know the story came out what was it years had passed but the time had come for the for that word to be fulfilled when the season rolls around don't you worry the crop will be there that's right and Brethren if there ever was a time for the next few minutes now he said I want to talk to you to your heart if there ever was a time that the time has come for the word to be fulfilled it is now this is the day he says the time had come and add to the Living World to show his word made true the time had come in Babylon where they laughed God to score and they made fun of the Hebrew children but the time come for God to speak he said when Daniel was thrown into the lion's den the time had gone for God to move and to speak out and he closed the mouth of the line the time that come when Mary was coming from a well that day with a pot of water on her head the time had come for the visitation of the Savior the time come when John the Baptist was born as a forerunner to fulfill the word of God because he was the voice of one crime in the wilderness in Isaiah 40. the time come for John to be born now listen to this he says I put him in a grave they put a seal on the grave they Garrison a bunch of soldiers a century a hundred men armed around there to be sure that nothing would take place for three days he laid there Friday Saturday and Sunday but on Sunday morning the first Easter no many how many army no matter how many armies was there how well it was Garrison the time had come for the word of God to be fulfilled it's not his I'll suffer not my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell that time had come I don't care what takes place it's going to happen anyhow the time had come I say let that ring out tonight let that ring out tonight the time has come for the Fulfillment of all things the time has come for your healing tonight that time has come for the body change the time has come for the Rapture that time has come at the blood of Christ recognize who she is as he's standing on the earth and let him Garrison us let him put a thousand demons ten thousand demons a million demons let's come out of the river Euphrates it's time and when the time is here nothing or nobody or no devil in hell can stop it it's time for fulfillment [Music] looking here at the beginning Genesis 3 and 3. and we are going to read a lot of scriptures tonight so just bear with me he says put up the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die no notice the attack here is actually on fulfillment that the word wouldn't be fulfilled the way God said it would be fulfilled the attack here is that it is possible for one word not to be fulfilled or for one word to fail because if one word can fail then what about this word and if this word can contradict this word then what about this one over here and pretty soon it becomes a very slippery slope and then you have nowhere to stand because well this one failed and I don't know if this is true and this and then all of a sudden your anchors not holding anymore amen hey man you have no place to rest but brother Brown says to the believer if God said it that settles it see there is your resting place listen you can hang your soul on every word of God tonight every word of God you can hang your soul that it's going to be fulfilled you believe that tonight amen Jeremiah 1 and 12 then said the Lord unto me thou Hast well seen for I will hasten my word to perform it now I'm gonna go through these next scriptures quickly so you may not have the opportunity to turn with me if you want to try that's fine but it's just a few examples to drive this point home about When God Says something he brings it to pass Matthew 2 15. and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my son Matthew 2 23 and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth that it might be fulfilled which is spoken by the prophets he shall be called a Nazarene Matthew 8 16. when the evening would come they brought onto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sickness listen this here Micah 5-2 but thou Bethlehem you freighter though thou be little among the thousands of Judah [Music] that is to be ruler in Israel who's going forth have from Everlasting now we're going to jump all the way over into the New Testament here in Luke 2. and it came to pass in those days that there went out of decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed can you imagine the griping that went on I can't because I'd have been one of them yeah they're always just trying to get our money they're taxing us here they're taxing us there they're going to make a cashless Society they're going to do this they're going to make it and the whole time God's going calm down I got this I'm doing this for a purpose down to verse three Luke two and three and it all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea under the city of David him because he was at the house of the lineage of Maven to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child why the taxation of an entire nation why the hardship because he had to be born in Bethlehem no matter what God's gonna make sure his word is fulfilled brother Brown says another thing we want to know this is just at the very time that he had to raise taxes on the people and in doing that it forced Joseph and his wife to be or he says as a spouse wife married be forced back into Bethlehem God knows how to do things come on somebody God knows how to do things where are you standing at tonight what is your situation what are you facing God knows how to do things let me give you a testimony real quick this is off off course for a minute but I just feel to testify God knows how to do things this is a message of restoration this imma be real open and honest with y'all for a minute I feel comfortable here I grew up in a household where my parents did not like each other much less love each other they just went what is he fixing to talk about I grew up in a house Grooms buddy by the time I was 19 my parents my dad divorced my mom a few years later by the grace of God got a hold of my Dad's life and brought him back to the Lord so for the next 20 years this wasn't awkward at all my dad said on that side of the church and my mom sat on that side of the church and dad started to to hate it he'd come to me he's on my porch and he'd say son talk to me I know God hates divorce I know God hates divorce I want to fix this I don't want this hanging over me I don't want to go meet God with this hanging over me what do I do and I would just be honest with him I said Dad if you've made it right in your heart the only way it can get fixed like here is if she's got a warrant fixed too I've got to work on both ends let me admit something to y'all I say this in shame you don't know how impossible this was to the point that I didn't even pray for it but can we be honest tonight and be real so I just had I just know I forgot about it because I didn't forget about it I'd quit praying about it quit even hoping to see it I was just like I was happy that God had done what he had done I was happy that he was in church I was happy mama was in church don't stop short don't stop short my daddy got diagnosed with cancer about a year ago maybe more than that now time flies it got real bad back in January ended up in the hospital when new things was going south and and one day my father-in-law but Tim sends me a picture my mom was in it with my dad which wasn't completely abnormal when my dad would get sick for some reason mom would go see him and bring him stuff and they treated each other cordially enough you know what I'm saying but but she was sitting on the bed holding his hand now that was different but Tim said you know what this is I wrote back and said no sir he said this is your parents wedding photo they just got remarried and renewed their vows in the hospital room they got remarried God restored don't give up on your situation don't give up on your child don't give up on your marriage don't quit don't give up on your wayward loved ones all the way to the end listen my Daddy went to be with the Lord on March 31st but he went a married man he went a man whose family was restored this message restores this God restores don't give up he will fulfill all that he has taught us don't quit don't look at something that's hopeless God can still do it [Applause] Psalms 22 18 they parked my garments among them and cast lots upon my best Year Matthew 27 35 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my master did they cast lots what are we reading these four just a reminder that God knows what he's doing God knows what he's doing tonight circumstances are not in control every scripture every word everything he ever spoke about you and about this bride is going to come to pass but you got to keep your eyes on that because somebody is going to fulfill it Others May stop short Others May find a good place to stop like Reuben and Gad did but somebody's going to cross over somebody's going to go all the way back into fulfillment listen Malachi 4 was sent to turn us back to the faith back to the original it didn't turn us to go halfway back it in turn us to give us some correct doctor come on now it turned us to go all the way back you can trace it back to the book of Acts you can trace it back into the upper room listen God started his church the way he wanted it and now he wants his church the way he started it back to the original not halfway back not cold and dead and dry and formal but he wants a church alive spring it up on the inside Hallelujah he called us to go oh the way back somebody's gonna go somebody's gonna go back to the works that I do shall you do also somebody's gonna fulfill that somebody's gonna overcome my Odyssey somebody's gonna take it go back and take the land of the Holy Ghost take the land it's her you're taken the words already said it was going to be fulfilled I say it might as well be us somebody's gonna do it who it might as well be me and it'll be you take your position tonight take the land that God's called you to take we know that God had told Abraham in Genesis 15 and 13. that his seed would be a stranger in the land and be afflicted 400 years and we know that was fulfilled and then in verse 14 God tells Abraham that the nation that does this to them is going to be judged and then God comes and he fulfills that we know the plagues just begin to fall out as he begins to judge the second part of verse 14 says and afterwards shall they come out great substance this was also repeated to Moses in Exodus 3 21 and I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians and it shall come to pass that when you go you shall not go empty now you know sometimes we look at things and we look at situations and we say how Lord you're not that I'm not I know you got but how right right you're married didn't ask that in doubt she just said how will these things be in other words I believe you you mind sharing with me how we're gonna do this sometimes we say how if you was one of the slaves who had been there with absolutely nothing who had everything you ever known Stripped Away from you from Generations after Generations you've been beaten you've been told you were worthless you've been told you can't fulfill the promise you've been told that you can't leave you might have looked at the same promise and went you know slaves and great substance don't exactly go hand in hand how is this going to be how is this going to be but tonight I want us to never forget how quickly the Lord can work how quick things can change just in a moment all it takes is one moment in the presence of God all it takes is One Moment In His presence for everything to change listen one day Ruth was gleaning in the field trying to survive and the next day she owned the field hello make it happen quick oh but I'm struggling I'm having hardship just hang on just in an instant just in a moment this moment I'm sick next moment I'm well this moment my my children's gone the next moment they're coming down the dirty Road oh come on it all can happen in just an instant don't forget how quickly things can change one moment you're tormented the next minute free one moment depression the next minute Joy one minute anxiety the next minute peace that's the kind of God we serve tonight amen you just keep playing Satan just keep plugging him just keep pulling it out just keep to listen listen sometimes you hear people say the devil don't give me no rest when is the last time he said that about you when's the last time he said oh no he got up again oh until he says get out one moment of slave one moment of mortal the next moment body change Rapture eternity it did all happen in a moment in a twinkling of an hour Hallelujah thank you one moment just keep plaguing him quick can you just keep tormenting devils [Music] and there's going to come a time and that time is now that all he has robbed from you he's gonna have to give back oh come on he says oh you know he always comes and tries to put things over it's all you've done this you gotta passed yeah true but at least I got a future he says you gotta pass you got these sins in your life you battle pornography you battled lust you battle drugs you as my slave you can never be free maybe those ain't what you battling maybe just come to the sense you never pray you lukewarm Christian you're not an overcomer you're a nobody who cares that you live a different lifestyle from other people I don't make you nothing special you can never be rich in joy you slave you can never be rich in overcoming power and he takes and it takes and it takes and it takes but you just keep placing him and you start taking back I'm gonna take my joy back I'm gonna take my piece back I'm gonna take everything that belongs to me back because the words that I can have it the words that I can go free the word said there's a land I'm going to the words that somebody's gonna fulfill it and it might as well be me I'm taking it all back Hallelujah oh one of these days he's gonna get tired of he said take your piece take your time take your kids and just get out of my kingdom and I'm gonna go Hallelujah [Applause] some of the ancient writers look at these scriptures in Psalms and they said that the Egyptians actually gladly gave them all their goods if they would just promise to leave just come take whatever you want as long as you get out just come take it assessor right there in Psalms 105 37 says he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes Egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them no no no it was the fear no no no no it was the fear of him hey I fell upon them listen come on Satan don't ever give up he don't ever give up I don't like to give him any credit but I'll give him that he don't ever quit he keeps coming at you and if for some reason Satan comes to you tonight he says oh you really have no you don't got no legal right for your joy you don't got no legal right for your freedom you don't have no right for your peace you still got some Reef into you you sold a lot of things out there and you still owe me you still owe me I'd like to remind the devil tonight my debt's been paid oh no you nothing it was all paid that day on Calvary oh you nothing tonight as a matter of fact if anything he owes me he stole from me he stole from my family and he hasn't gotten away with one thing it will all be recompensed upon the devil's head you owe the devil nothing tonight as a matter of fact he owns you and I'll say give it back give it back give me back my health Give Me Back My Worship listen you got a Right To Worship in the house of God you've been set free you've got a right to worship a king of kings the King of Kings is in the building and I say worship bam Praise Him rejoice in his presence because you have a right to worship Him Hallelujah give God grace tonight you gotta write you're free the debt is paid Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm gonna tell y'all a little story this is true I'm a history guy you can find this the Egyptians tried to sue the Jews in the 4th Century in the court of Alexander demanding that the Jews pay restitution for all the Egyptian gold and silver that they took along with them when they left in The Exodus says gavia the son of Pacifica a simple but wise Jew who requested the Sage's permission to present a defense on behalf of the Jews all right if he asked the Egyptians for evidence demo devil that the Jews absconded with their wealth the crime they said is clearly recorded in your Torah the Egyptians gleefully responded in that case kevia said the Torah also says that 600 000 Jews were unjustly enslaved by the Egyptians for many many years let's calculate how much you owe us [Applause] the Egyptian asked for three days in which they could come back and with a counter uh response and what they use those three days for was the high tell it out of town because they knew it was the truth he says you've done this and you've sinned and this is the true listen oh come on now come on now listen he likes to stack the facts up against you we're gonna go there for a minute and he likes to tell you listen listen the facts don't always represent the truth the fact is I was a sinner because I did a lot of things that should have sent me straight to Hell the fact is I was no good I was nobody I was from a broken home I backslit on God those are all the facts but the truth is he said I could go free the truth is it came and sacrificed his body and I could live eternally the truth is tonight regardless of what the facts say you're healed you're free you're delivered in the name of Jesus that is the true tonight in the house of God we don't owe the devil one thing I gotta try to gear down them and I got two more foreign they came out blessed they came out Victorious and all along the word was being fulfilled every step of the way they were walking in fulfillment yes there was a great stumble at kadish we know that but that didn't stop the word from being fulfilled God had to use a different generation but he still fulfilled it with Seed of Abraham it didn't stop the word from being fulfilled God was going to have the Seed of Abraham possess the land seated Abraham he's going to have seated Abraham possess the land Genesis 15 18 says in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto that said have I given this land from the river of Egypt under the Great River of the river Euphrates this was going to be fulfilled it didn't matter how many times man messed up look at our mess up don't hinder the Fulfillment I understand that your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you're gonna be there he may have to you may have to go through some stuff because we can be we're pretty ignorant sometimes but God don't go I knew I should have picked him look at that and the devil's going I told you I told you he was not how it works that's how it works the devil goes look look how much he messed up look at that stone look at that failure and God's going can't see through the blood I don't even know what you're talking about I can't see his message I can't see his stuff but what are you what are you even talking about he doesn't change his mind he's not going to get to the marriage supper and go I had one too many plates out oh he's gonna get you there you've been called to it you've been called for it you're gonna get there amen take our eyes away just for a moment from the children of Israel but following the same type God once again had a people Royal Seed of Abraham that down through the church ages had become enslaved they become slaves to a Catholic system that held them down with kriegs and dogma's a man it held them the way they held the people was by withholding the word from them so they held the People by withholding the word but but God began to move and Luther comes on the scene and the Reformation begins and it wasn't a Reformation just for the sake of reformation it wasn't just to do it just to say oh we reformed the church but it was a Reformation to start a journey it was a Reformation to start the journey to return back to the original and brother Brown says it comes back to the original grain is that right and his ministry comes from them reformations back to the original word again the word comes to a prophet and he promised it Malachi 4 and to restore the faith of the people back to the original grain what went in the ground is here the same listen somebody's going all the way back to the original somebody's not gonna be just something different they're gonna go all the way back they're not going to stop short of people that's going to come to the river and the water don't scare them on they say I like the water I'm getting in the water I will listen let the water cleanse you come on through to the other side cross on over to the other side tonight you may have come a long way and I'm proud of that I'm thankful for that but I'm telling you come on across into fulfillment you don't gotta stay on that side of the river [Applause] Joel 2 25 and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I said among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed there's going to be a people restored back to what it was before the Locust but before the canker worm before the the caterpillar before the Palmer worm or let's just put it like this in a historical sense before the Nicene Council before the church began to Fall Away back to that place somebody's going to be willing to cross back over to listen let's go ahead and say it or in some places it's a dirty word but I feel freedom here somebody's going back to original Pentecost somebody's going all the way back listen the fact that a denomination came and robbed the name Pentecost don't scare me none that don't scare me not I know what Pentecost is it's not a denomination it's an experience it's the outpouring of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I want it tonight you can call me a Holy Roller you can call me a fanatic you can call me what you want but you're gonna have to call me an original because I'm going back oh I'm not a same to my family I'm not ashamed of my Kinfolk Paul and Peter and Stephen those are my people and I'm going back to that Hallelujah back to the grain again because it's only in that place that we can fulfill what God has called us to fulfill in this day [Music] Reuben and God and half the tribe of Manassas stopped short of crossing over but this is crossing over time today is the day we can't stop sure we can't perpetuate the ages you know it didn't matter on any other day that Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh didn't cross the river because it wasn't crossing over day it didn't matter they was just doing what their boss was doing that's a long for the journey they was following the pillar of Fire they'd been called out by a message too many people fall in love with and you should don't get me wrong anything I say don't think I'm knocking it I'm just telling you there's more for you too many people fall in love with the calling out portion but the same message that called you out takes you in it doesn't call you out to leave you it calls you out to take you in [Applause] listen let me make a little point right here and I know we're we're running on time but you know you could have went out there and followed the message to a T and put Blood on the doorpost and on the matter and the Death Angel passing what a victory that was what a thing to celebrate what a place but the very next day as Israel left if you were sitting on your front porch underneath that blood going what are y'all doing you bunch of fanatics the prophet said put Blood on the doorpost the problem I'm gonna stick with what the prophet said you realize how many people have been snared by a truth it's exactly what happened to the denominations they got a truth and they wouldn't move from it it was true that you had to put Blood on the door post but it is also true that you better go and it would listen let me tell you what what a place to be when the Red Sea opened and your enemies were drowned but if you're still there six days later dancing on the banks of the Red Sea you just left behind too many of us are stuck at the last place we had a great Victory I said come on come on it's time for some more Victory it's time for some more wins it's time to take some more land move over where you were I'm not seeing a new message it was the same message but the pillar of fire was leading them that meant they were going somewhere we gotta cross over into fulfillment Hallelujah We Can't Stop I'm having to skip some of this but we can't stop short of where we're called to be no matter how good the land looks listen the land we're Roofing and get stopped was good-looking land but we can't stop there We Can't Stop in that in that place we got to press forward brother Brown says we've adopted today we've adopted other things we've adopted church membership instead of an upper room we've adopted theology instead of the baptism we've adopted everything else instead of this thing that God told us to do because we've listened to the rules and Orders of men but when God shared that Gospel Light Shine in the morning over Yonder on the Eastern country he said it's been a day that wasn't dark nor light it's been a day hazy the Sun and power cannot be seen a mixed light a hazy day he said they know the Sun was shining but the clouds has put it out of their sight people had enough Faith to say yes Jesus was the son of God he's gone away we can see enough to believe salvation but you can't believe all of it and they stop short he says that he goes on to talk about when the king come to the prophet asking for a victory over Syria and he put the arrow of Deliverance in his hand and told him to go strike it and he only Struck it a few times he said why'd you do that why'd you do that strike for more strike for more tonight strive for more wherever you're at I'm I'm happy you're there but strike for more than justification strike for more than sanctification strike for a full and filling of the baptism of the ghost s once you get that strike for a refilling of the Holy Ghost the prophet of God said that the Dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I say Lord I need it God pour it out I'm striking for it tonight I'm striking for the power of God I'm striking for healing in our midst I'm striking for the gifts I'm striking for as anointing I'm striking for a refilling of the Holy Ghost I'm striking for all of it tonight and I will not stop short yeah we got a strike for the dividends he says I'll tell you what's the matter with Christians tonight you're not drawing dividends on your baptism of the Holy Ghost he says draw in and drink and drink and drink and drink and drink until you push out salvation push out Divine Healing push out the baptism of the Holy Ghost and drink and drink and drink it's time to take another drink tonight telling you you ain't got the Holy Ghost I'm telling you why not take another drink tonight the rock followed them they're right here tonight the Rocks now just take another drink get refreshed tonight when's the last time you were refreshed in the presence of the Lord listen justification was a good land sanctification was good land the gifts was good land listen Pentecost never made an error now I'm talking about denominational Azusa Street by accepting the gifts their error was rejecting the word do we understand so when you get excited and the holy spirit moves and people run and shout and jump and dance and speak in tongues and people go you bunch of Pentecostals uh I don't identify with that because I'm not a word rejector I haven't rejected the word I've accepted the word why am I excited because of the word the word is open I'm excited because of the word tonight it's been restored I don't identify with that and if you say well it's word word and reject all the gifts and the movement of the spirit and the supernatural you're making the same error they they may just in a different ditch come on but we can have all of it we can have all of it you don't gotta pick and choose and say well I better not take too much you can have all of it tonight let me move on a little bit Hallelujah Reuben and dad had followed the pillar of Fire these weren't people that weren't accustomed to the moving of the spirit these weren't people that didn't believe the message they'd followed it all the way up to the River Jordan but then when it came time to cross over when it came time listen they'd followed the message through through sanctification they'd followed through justification recognize the era of denominations they had followed it long enough to recognize this is a Vindicated prophet they followed it that long they followed it far enough to stay under its protection stay under its blessings even so far they'll go as far as to say we've got the Holy Ghost but on our condition we've got the Holy Ghost but only on terms that we're comfortable with we've got the Holy Ghost because we believe yes I'm not arguing with you you better believe and you can't get the Holy Ghost without believing but this isn't some denominational philosophy where you walk up and say well I believe the message so I'm okay no no no no listen brother Brown made it very very very very very very clear that you can't Rob The Experience out of it he said they all want to dodge the new birth they want to dodge the new birth they don't want that experience because it's messy he said it's messy whether it's in a hospital room or whether it's in a pig pen a birth is always messy they want the Holy Ghost without the experience well listen that's not how it happened originally if we're going to go back to the original we've got to go back to the original of the original like I said I don't want to walk up the staircase to the upper room and get to the door and go Ah that's enough no I'm going on in I gotta have my own backside of the desert burning bush experience and you gotta have that tonight we can't be afraid or scared of the new birth at the original they staggered like drunk people and they spoke in tongues how it happened prophet of God says the mother of Jesus Christ had to go up there and be included in that bunch of people so drunk on the spirit till she staggered like she was drunk on whiskey or something and you think you'll get to Heaven by slipping over the church and putting your songbook under your arm and walking over every Sunday and the Bell Tolls and you sit and listen and walk back you'll never do it you have to come that route because that's the only route God ever laid down and ever has you'll walk it or you won't be there listen here's the deal if you don't like this portion you just um I'm leaving my opinion out of this completely this is this is your Prophet speaking he says I'm not your judge but I'm preaching the gospel that's exactly the truth the Blessed Virgin was right there acting yes just as idiotic as the rest of them did just as drunk as the rest of them these men and women every one of them was full of new wine if God ever changed that program put your finger on it on the scripture for me it isn't there no sir it was plumbed to the end of the age that way come to the end of the Bible and it'll be that way till Jesus comes Hallelujah that I say pour it out there whatever it takes gotta get it I ain't ashamed I just want it I want to be there my children are gonna be there and I'm hoping to receive it however you want to give it tonight time for fulfillment but if you're gonna fulfill it you gotta get filled Hallelujah gotta go back to the original we're gonna begin to wind this down we're gonna cross into the land of the Fulfillment you'll not fulfill everything unless you come all all the way back to the original furnace it's a land of the Holy Ghost it's a land of the supernatural let me tell you the devil hates the supernatural so much he attacks it so much and he tries to bring doubts about supernatural events and he wants to keep you out of it he'll bring he'll bring doubts and he'll bring uh um he'll question the authentic authenticity of certain events it's his tactic to undermine the Supernatural and seem like it's merely a coincidence that it was just entirely made up because what happens is he did the same thing with Janice and jambres the way they withstood Moses and tried to act like what was the point of Denison jambrief to try to act like that the Miracles in the Supernatural was nothing more than a mere magician's trick to make the supernatural seem like not that big of a deal to take away from the power what was its intent was to discredit it to remove faith in the power of God why because that was the power in that state yes that was that's why God said he showed them this for that was the power that was going to take them out of Egypt and so if I can get Jim this is Janice and jam Brees if I can get them to disbelieve in the Supernatural if I can discredit the Supernatural and say it's all emotion discredit the Supernatural and and and and point to the failures of Azusa Street Pentecost point to their failures say oh well they jump and they shout and they do those things too but it's only emotion it's only a magician's trick and it gets you to where you're afraid of the supernatural listen I'll say it like this we're not afraid of a little bit of Wildfire because there's plenty of wet blankets around here to put it out listen we got way too many people that are spiritual fire extinguishers and all of a sudden something right there whoa no no no no no they almost shouted they almost got excited they almost ran around what would have happened if they'd ride around this building I don't know what would have happened maybe somebody got loose maybe somebody got free hey I'm just the opposite I see a little smart and say Where's that gasoline I say pour some gasoline on it I say when a supernatural starts to break free embrace it enjoy it realize it hey you want to know what I'm shouting about you want to know what I'm excited about join me one time get loose one time get free one time oh come on there was some Fanatics one day that was running from the battle and they threw their dead friend on some bones that had life in it I wish some of y'all get on something with some life in it tonight and all of a sudden the dead guy got up went to run and they said that guy's been dead 25 years on the front row what happened he came in contact with some lies and that life got on and all of a sudden he was running and he was shouting and praising God tonight foreign that's the power that heals our sick that's the power that sets people free from addiction that's the power that breaks depression and it's the power that's gonna take me home it's the power that's going to change my body it's the power I feel it drawing me even now and the draw from that world is getting stronger than the draw from this world you say I don't feel anything well you better get to looking for something soon because any day now any day now they're starting to fall and it's starting to draw and I'm saying Lord just take us take us home Lord we're ready I'm ready to fulfill the greatest event in the history of humankind the Rapture of the church I'm ready for fulfillment I'm ready for the body change I'm ready for total victory tonight Hallelujah [Music] back to Genesis 49. and we're not going to go through all these that was a long reading but we read what we were reading there was the prophecies and the blessings that Jacob was speaking this was our opening scripture over his sons and in these it helps us to understand why they made the choices that they made and even the conduct of the tribes and the Fulfillment that comes through each one of those tribes you can trace it back to these blessings that he puts upon we know that Jesus was the is the line of the tribe of Judah and the root and The Offspring of David he's the firstborn of any Brethren he is the firstborn of every creature according to Colossians now nothing is by accident and we've established that God works every situation to come to pass the way he wants it to Judah is the trial by assignment Rubin lost the birthright okay listen to me Reuben was technically Jacob's firstborn son he says so in the scripture reading but he forfeited the firstborn rights of inheritance through misconduct and he lost them to Judah we see that in Genesis 49 3 and 4 First Chronicles five one and it's for that reason that the ruler belongs to Judah we saw that in Genesis 49 and 10 it says the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a law Giver from between his feet until Shiloh come now when we think of Jacob's blessings upon his sons we have to realize that that each prophetic blessing was not so much upon an individual son as it was upon that son's future descendants and it was for that sub it would also be what each one of those ascendants would have to walk under that was the thing that was pronounced over them it was more intended as a prophecy upon those thousands of descendants who would later be born into that tribe and Not only was it pronouncing the Destinies as it were of these tribes he was pronounced in the characteristics that each of these tribes would develop and those characteristics were but extensions of the already developed and displayed characteristics of his sons so Genesis 49 and 3 he says Reuben Thou Art my firstborn my might in the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power unstable us [Applause] that was he was unstable he made bad decisions he's never going to excel because of this and we see that when it comes time to cross over he would not cross over he made a bad decision but family Cycles have been something that humans have had to battle from the very beginning of time when it comes to your natural family you have to be a cycle breaker we can't lean into into the crutch so this is how my daddy was this is how my mama was this is just how my family is temper runs in my family lust problems running my family that's why we get a new birth we understand we can't lean back into the crutch of this we have to be cycle cycle Breakers and 4919 says God a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last now this is a very very brief blessing on on God about God's future as a military force and they were but the reason it speaks this way where it says a troop shall overcome him it is actually talking about all the battles and Wars he's going to have to fight more than any other tribe because of where he chose to settle he settled closest to the enemy he settled in enemy territory without his brothers and sisters around him for strength and reinforcement oh I can serve God and not come to the house of God okay but prepare for a lot of battles prepare for a lot of hardships prepare for a lot of things that you wouldn't have had to go through if you'd have just assembled yourself with your fellow brothers and sisters that have been there to help you fight your battles it says yeah you're gonna overcome at the end I'm not telling you you're not gonna make it I'm telling there's lots of things you're going to deal with because you didn't do it the way the word said to when he said assemble yourselves together but they were constantly attacked because they settled short and it says in the end they're going to win and most of the time they did but notice that they're fighting battles and enduring trials that they didn't have to they were attacked on all sides because of where they chose to settle and the prophecy had seen them there the prophecy had saw that Reuben would not Excel now listen as we bring this down and generation after generation would walk on think about it that was the blessing that you had to walk on her every day of your life every generation has the characteristics of the patriarch of their tribe would play out in the Fulfillment of their lives they didn't even really have a say in the matter this is how it's going to be this is prophecy the characteristics of the sons of Jacob were passed down into the tribes and the prophecies would prove true time and time again and then once again as they failed to fulfill all that they were called to do when they failed to cross over once again it was a fulfillment of this prophecy that had been put upon their lives but what I'm telling you is is that as the Royal Seed of Abraham we don't carry the characteristics of just some patriarch over our head come on now we don't care that we carry the characteristics of the Lion of the tribe of Judah so when I look and say am I going to overcome I ask you a question did he overcome am I gonna make it did he make it am I going to tear Satan's kingdom down did he tear Satan's kingdom down yes he did yes he did yes he did and I'm walking underneath the characteristics of the Lord Jesus Christ or we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride so what are we gonna do we are gonna fulfill all that has been spoken about the bride in this day we're gonna cast Satan down we're gonna heal the sick cast out Devils Jacob body change Jacob rapture we can't help it it's what Papa John is going to do through us we carry his genetic oh Hallelujah I carry the genetics of Jesus Christ the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and I have been called to fulfill all foreign Hallelujah The Works that he did shall you do us

Down but there was another people and started going up that's you how do I know that's me because this message called your name it didn't listen I don't care what somebody else's daddy says about me
