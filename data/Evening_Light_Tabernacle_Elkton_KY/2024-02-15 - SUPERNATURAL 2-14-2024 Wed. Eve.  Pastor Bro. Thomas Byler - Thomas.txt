========================================

called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel and one of his servants said none oh Lord AR the king but elishah the prophet that is in Israel tell the king of Israel the words that thou speakest th bed chamber all right then went out to spy him out and so forth and in verse 15 and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and host Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them amen I thought that would make a great message sometime amen they that are with us are more than they that are with Him amen praise the Lord and I Elijah prayed and said Lord I will pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about elishah may God bless his ADD His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen that's really the only two scriptures that I have tonight amen praise the Lord all right we're just going to do a little lesson tonight would that be okay all right let's talk about it for just a minute talking about the supernatural first of all amen not just the natural but the supernatural amen um in the world you and I live in we seem to think that we see so little Supernatural things we long to see Supernatural things don't we amen the whole world wants to see Supernatural things but now remember in the spirit realm first of all our bodies Our beings brother Bram being is that right amen one of them was of course your body next was your spirit and your soul now how many knows your spirit is Supernatural your soul is Supernatural so when you think about it if you want to talk about supernatural 2third of you is Supernatural amen we are 2/3 Supernatural onethird oh I ain't got to go back there do I amen onethird natural amen so we're made that made up that way amen and so we we think about that how that you know in the spirit realm and then in the soul realm and this is actually just a house that we live in the real man is on the inside but prophet of God said said some things that it's kind of hard probably for most people to really fathom you know I mean I don't I don't know if any of the preachers before brother bam ever said that when you're looking at you you're not really seeing you you have never seen you wow that's kind of a new thing isn't it and statements like everything that you see is not real amen come up against people he says if I can't see it I don't believe it it's not real but says it's just the opposite everything you see is not real it's only the things that you don't see that's real amen and I want to tell you we are gathered here this evening this Wednesday night we didn't come to see the nice new platform here and everything all that that's all wonderful or to see each other or how we dress or come to see our hats or whatever it might be this that or the other like they do on Easter or what we're not coming to look at the out but but you come for one reason and that is to look beyond what you see how how many don't realize it that's why even the prophet of God said it's so important to come early come and pray amen how manyan know it's so important so many times when you pray when you sing when you worship I like to close my eyes huh a lot of time when I'm worshiping and and just why you're closing the Avenue you're closing the door to everything visible and now you're looking to something that you don't see at all amen cuz God is invisible ible he's in a different dimension amen so you close your eyes and isn't it something how even the prophet of God when he would be praying for people and amen casting out devils and he tells that everybody close your eyes close your eyes you don't want to see it I don't know if it it must have a bearing on Spirits coming into you amen I don't know about you but if you know with a big old hideous dark demon was coming at you I'd rather not know I'd rather not know I'd rather not have to fight because that fear in itself might allow him to come into you but close your eyes and just be reverent and humble is that right and brother bam take every spirit and there under his control for the glory of God as long as ever close your eyes like they were supposed to guess what them demons couldn't get into them people but there was people that were disrespectful and just wanted to see the whole thing ain't that right they end up being epileptic the rest of their life the whole CH Church a whole group of them bunch of people amen so it's important when you come to church cuz how many knows you had a lot of cares today you had to work all day yeah a lot of things happen and it's time to come to church and close your eyes to all of that cuz when you come here we want to set an atmosphere create an atmosphere of Faith because you're now remember this that's where you get your strength from that's where all your power everything that you have all the strength that you have spiritually comes from you being shut in with God when you get shut in with God you shut everything else out and the more you can do that the better off you're going to be [Applause] amen the stronger you will be everything you see is not real everything everything is not real everything you do not see is real even all of our Weaponry all of our spiritual Weaponry something that you do not see with your eyes amen Peter he wanted to fight a battle he pulled the sword didn't he he went he says no no this our battle is not of this world we're not of this world of another world is that right the battle we have is by faith man you know one of the two greatest weapons three greatest I think he hear said three greatest weapons in God's Arsenal is one is Faith because it knows no defeat amen and love is even greater and that because there's nothing greater than love love overcomes all kinds of things we will try to if we have time to get into a little bit of that amen but talk talking about how that love overcomes hatred it overcomes bitterness and it's something you don't see but it's something that's real oh my but it's unseen amen everything about this amen is unseen and it's supernatural amen now how many knows that God is Supernatural and when he speaks she speaks a supernatural word but said we have a supernatural god with a supernatural seed word speaking to a supernatural Seed of Abraham he called us the supernatural seed amen Supernatural seed amen doing Supernatural signs amen praise the Lord one of the first things you know faith is something that's not seen that right faith is something that's not seen But if God ever brings that to you it is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen when you begin to accept that Supernatural word of God God it brings you to a supernatural birth how many believe that that's inner man is a supernatural being amen outside of that oh my that just absolutely throws out everybody that says the days of Miracles is p no such a thing as the Holy Ghost well they apparently don't have the Holy Ghost today their miracles it's pasted cuz they ain't even got the Holy Ghost but when you got God on the inside one thing God will not do is deny his own work no no no you talk anybody that got the Holy Ghost they're very careful about what they deny amen but you can't deny if you got the Holy Ghost they say they do but they don't not down in the soul they don't you can't have the Holy Ghost and say the days of Miracles is passed why you're to oh my I was writing this down here I said if you claim to be the if you claim to be a Christian and S days and miracles is pth well guess what it took a miracle for you to get born again so the they has not pass how many believe if you get the new that's an absolute Miracle it takes a supernatural work of God to bring a birth that's why it's so important that every one of our children get that birth otherwise they ain't got an anchor on the inside of the inside that unseen I Ain got it and it won't hold him amen that's right a supernatural word praise the Lord Brother B talked about how that people human beings we're so curious about what is beyond the curtain what is out there and they fail to recognize what's out there first of all they Rec don't even recognize who they are anybody that's lived very long knows that your natural ability hello your natural strength and joy of natural that doesn't go very far but it's about that spirit that you got how many know that's what we come to feed we come to feed that inner man to feed that Spirit not just the flesh oh my listen to what brother bam says he Begin by saying this looking at the Unseen he says it is a strange thing that man who was made in the image and likeness of God and was called to walk with him by faith amen how many knows that that's what we live living by faith in Jesus above that's right believing that God is would choose to walk by sight instead of by faith he says after his makeup we're all made up after his makeup his being and all that dwells in him was fashioned in the likeness of God and God is that great Jehovah who calls those things which are not as though they were and man was made to live with God in that manner I mean look we were made like I read Sunday and me we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son we were made to be in the likeness of almighty God butr takes Abraham you know how that he had the faith of God and me calling those things which were not as though they were that's why when sickness come no matter oh my I me just say this no matter what your condition is don't look at the condition look at the word that's the way reason why the more you feed on this how many know that whenever what you are what you we feed on we say right come to church and we feed on the word of God and guess what it's a supernatural word it's going to cause you to be a supernatural person amen they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover oh my oh my it's so awesome is it they drink any de inly thing you shall not hurt them that's right super Supernatural brother B I believe it's the books of his life story it's called the book The Supernatural books isn't that right his whole life was about supernatural I hope you're with me tonight but that's what I desire more and more Lord help me to see more Supernatural I'm a supernatural being super serving a supernatural God there'll be Supernatural signs and wonders oh my you should see them in your life I trust that you do and have is that right praise be to God Body Soul and Spirit we were made from a supernatural element when you're born and little baby coming out of the womb if you don't open that mouth and suck in that Spirit you won't live you'll be a dead person if you don't take in that spirit that right that's a super Natural Spirit waiting to inhabit you amen that's right you say Supernatural yeah it doesn't mean it's God they're Supernatural demons ain't that right but you're made supernaturally made of the supernatural praise be to God hallelujah my but B says you know the Bible says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and a man's physical being to be taken care of is not all the reason that God put him on the earth for because what he does with his physical being amounts to very [Music] little all the natural things that we are so busy every day doing really don't Mount to too much that's what I heard him say your physical being that's that's what's all B but brother B said man I'll tell you what you find a Band-Aid in a piece of pizza or man you find a bug and your soup and M I'm here to tell you send it back I want my money back find a fly in your soup it's going to be a problem if your steak isn't quite done right wonder if the preacher was that hard on you huh as we are the server some time better have it right amen what preacher come here man I never hear no amen I hear no P of me want want a little word God says don't bring me your lame sacrifices and offerings don't bring me your second best when you come to the house of God you give him your best amen the best you got is what he deserves he won't want nothing less than that your natural doesn't get the best list everybody your natural shouldn't have the best your spiritual should have the best the spiritual is first the naturally second let's get it right oh help us Lord feed that spiritual man let him be able to lift a th000 pounds or more aren't you glad to serve a supernatural God aren't you God glad that there's a God that intermingles in on our behalf in your life he has showed himself all the time everywhere he has come down in a special way there's a supernatural element I like that Supernatural element it's what puts a smile on my face go ahead it's what puts a smile on your face because defeat is distress defeat is no peace in that person that's defeated that's living in the natural don't have that Supernatural amen how many know even if God forgives you of your sin it's a miracle it's a supernatural act for God to forgive you when you get on your knees when you close your eyes whether it's every day or not every night you say God forgive me of my sins today amen it's a supernatural act that comes and makes you feel better again we need more of that Supernatural that's right something's going on over there when you close your eyes things happen how many believe that but said when the weakest Christian gets down on his knees Devils tremble why because Angels come and they Minister and they're just waiting for you to say something they're waiting to minister to according to your confession they they to make it right or if the devil tripped you up see God the devil trip me up I ask you to forgive me I'll tell you what in the other realm the angels are punching them Devils everywhere they're trembling they trying to get you to believe no you can't be forgiven you're no good you ain't no really a Christian you ain't going to make it that's what they want to put in there but there you are saying I'm your child God I know you'll forgive me the Angels tremble when you get down on your knees and you ask God to forgive things happen when you close your eyes you talk to the master he fills you with faith you come up there buff you come up there say where them Devils act amen Lord help us to live in the Supernatural realm but Braham says your natural it's not as important as what you think but we're so busy we live how much percent of our life just doing the Natural Things is that right how much time do we spend in prayer I never mentioned the other well I did twoo the two many more powerful things Faith love and brother said prayer is one of the most powerful things there is why cuz for one thing Jesus said for ask and it shall be given to you ask and it shall be given to you when you're on your KNE and you ask something of God remember those angels are there to minister to you now when brother Brandon was here and brother Brandon prayed for those two sisters is't that right and said you're healed in the name of the Lord they went back home for two weeks they didn't get healed or something so but one morning guess what that angel finally CAU up to that prayer amen we got the prophit here but I'm here to tell you tonight if you'll ask God I don't care if it's at home tonight in your own little closet somewhere ask God and God will come and he'll make it happen for you we going wear this Flor out a that right he's going to make it happen well just because it didn't happen for S days who cares it didn't happen for two weeks who cares it didn't happen for 20 years who cares Abraham waited 25 years but he held on and God made it happen brother Brenham Illustrated every year oh I got the Buddha I got the bed ready I every year every year all the time sh how you feeling not yet how you feeling that now no morning SE this well it's going to be a greater am it's been 15 years but it's going to happen can we say it's been since 1965 our pro has went off the scene here we are 2 almost 24 but it's going to happen the Rapture is going to happen Supernatural power is going to do it it's going to take Supernatural power to change you it takes Supernatural power to change youth on a Wednesday night on a Sunday morning or wherever you are if you just open up your arms say God keep changing me amen Supernatural word what do you think's gonna happen eat that [Applause] stuff forgive me but whenever I get in into a good old steak amen or I get into some good food and my dogs are there and they want to nibble too I remember old tracker finally died brother John I say num n num n you want some of to num num well that's what this is very good very tasty how many believe that how many there should rapturing Faith lays in this message you can go beyond it if you want to you ain't got no guarantee that Beyond it is rapturing Faith you got guarantee that this has rapturing faith in it how many Bel this has a body change in it this has got joy unspeakable in it this has got peace in it Supernatural Supernatural Joy real what I am experiencing right now it ain't natural what you're feeling right now it's not natural It's Supernatural I have found his grace is all complete it supplies to my every need amen it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory Full Of Glory Full Of Glory somebody say it's full of Glory Full of Supernatural power David knew what that was he knew what it was like to rely on his Supernatural God when he took down Goliath Hallelujah Daniel he experienced a supernatural Pillar of Fire coming down in his life and Inter reading Moses is that right became a oneman army after meeting the supernatural let me just say what comes to my brain is that okay you become a onean Invasion to the devil it don't matter if everybody in church forsakes you it don't matter if you're the only one if you're really born again you will be a supernatural power that the devil's got to deal with one thing you got to learn is doesn't matter how many walk with you we love brothers and sisters I want a lot of them but they they didn't want hold you no it's your walk sometime God will let you walk alone look at brother bam at the end of his life not having hardly any open doors if there was ever ever any man that was forsaken it was him in his end of his days all them churches shut him out they didn't want that Jesus up in there Discerning thoughts and intent of the heart they didn't want to do that Messiah sign as a matter of fact the Pentecostal said anybody who goost goes to that meeting will excommunicate can I tell you something the man that said that was already excommunicated from the program of God that's right he was already excommunicated by the attitude that he took then he was misleading his people as many as he could to keep them away from the sign of the Messiah it wasn't was what Jesus Christ that's who came to the pulpit it was Christ they said don't you go there oh I can't wait to see the replay back on that in the day of judgment Oh I thought you said you told him not look that there I was you said you that make anybody come you go off to hell you misled a lot of people don't even think about coming into this place there' be no place for unbelievers and sinners over y all of those secrets of the heart will be made known Lord when I come to church and even brother BR I mean brother B preaches on me Lord here I am show me now I want to be open now I want to have it straight now not wait till I get over [Applause] there beware evening like Tabernacle beware all of you that you don't put your flesh first don't you put natural first you put the spiritual first if that ain't it you're an idolator that's right isn't it anything you put before God it don't matter what it is you put it before God it's idolatry Revelation says all idolators will have their part in the Lake of Fire amen well brother B you shouldn't be so hard on us it isn't me being hard on you it's God loving you as many as I love I rebuke I chase it I chastise I rebuke you if I love you why because I know oh come on listen to me real close tonight because I'm tellor to tell you that yourself myself it's me included Lord show me my weak places and show me where I'm wrong because that's the hardest place for anybody to see wrong it's on their own selves I should have a big Amen on that amen that's the hardest place it's your own fault and I tell that because of personal experience when the Lord goes to show me my fault I'm like wow you need some repenting you aren't what you ought to be amen you're loud mouth and speak before thinking and everything else say things you ought to say by God God's grace I've gotten a little wiser in my gray haired age and even when I came out and told Brother Tommy that can I share it with him I told him yesterday I said say brother Tommy now I can move it up to Thursday if you need me to but then were're working here yet and had you you you know it was quite a sight here about hour before service I come in and says Tommy I told you got to move thday and here he had done all that work and I felt like here he done all that work and all I can tell him is rebuke him but anyway so I felt bad I say no man yeah it's true you could have done it and stuff but I was just grateful that he took the time to do it and he's a whole lot like me when you get on a job man I see it done I see through it at the end of the day this is what I want done and he can see he can see 30 minutes before church that this will be over with when you come on in it'll probably be mostly cleaned up ain't that right but just things like that about myself say Lord help me to be sensitive amen praise the Lord how many needs a change in your life that's right husbands to your wife wives to you I mean we all got to learn how to walk we all got to learn how to talk oh I got to learn how to be a Christian and Christlike it's a learning process and it takes a supernatural Holy Ghost takes the Holy Ghost to show us what we need to change and oh let me say this listen to that Stills voice that's where you'll hear it that's where I hear it that's still Small Voice you'll just be going through today and something will say ah you know you shouldn't do that or think like that or or whatever it might be you you sisters or brother what you know you shouldn't wear that huh or it'll even tell you you know you shouldn't have done that it'll tell you hey you know you should make that right how many knows that's what the that's type of think the holy ghost that Supernatural power will tell you thank you Lord if I could have one wish for the church here and for everybody is that each and every one of us would hear that still Small Voice and he it each time amen we'd walk a lot better lives we'd walk a better walk we talk a better talk we'd act different we'd be kinder gentler meaker more loving more like Christ all the way around listen to that still Small Voice amen you love him amen I'm going to throw this in a few days ago this very next quote after uh he mentions about well let me finish this other one because what he does with his physical being amounts to very little it's his soul is what counts how many believe that Lord help us to realize it's your soul that counts it's the inward man that did not come from the earth I believe Paul talked about the Inner Man strengthening the inner man amen it come from heaven and that's the Eternal part of the human being amen and yet strange that he tries to figure out his own way amen if we find it so in the scriptures that when a man chooses to walk in his own way and do the way that he wants to God lets him alone huh how many know you want to go your own way want to do your own thing fall flat on your face fall flat on your face get up and say wow well that didn't work how many believe that's the truth people that is so easy for any of us to want to do it the way we want to do it that's right we want to do what we want to do be careful of that it's in your nature and it's not something you want to do because if you live that way and you do what you're gonna do I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do I don't care go ahead God will let you alone I don't want God to leave me alone amen no I want God to be all up in my business I like that I want God to be all up in my business I want him to be in my head I want him to be in my heart I want to be in my strength I want him to be in my soul I want him to be all up in my business I want them to be all up in my conscience amen my goodness every part of me that's right oh my man must not think for himself but he must let the mind that was in Christ be in him we are not to think for ourself we are to call anything that's contrary to what he said as though it's not amen no matter what our eyes claim to be we do not live by what we see we live by what we believe a few days ago I was listening to a program on the radio coming to Sunday school and it was round a Roundtable discussion with teenagers in Louisville what was one of the most important things was a girl to find a boy with curly hair or a boy a girl that's pretty and blue and brown eyes did that make the difference in seems like that that would be the great thing for a teenager but that isn't the greatest thing the greatest thing is to find your God your maker amen then next thing he says don't mix marry marry a boy that believes exactly like you do after all God is the main important thing that we are on earth to do is to serve him and if you do marry oh boy and if you do marry or anything contrary to that you'll pay for it in the days that lays ahead of you you'll pay for it in the days that lay ahead of you amen you must remember always by faith not by sight the just shall live by say faith we look to the Unseen how many believe that we look to the Unseen amen praise the Lord when a man catches the vision of the invisible God and know that he's already present there's something that stabilizes that man [Music] thinking Glory teenagers listen to be clearly a lot of time when you're a teenager you have complexes inferior complexes not as pretty as somebody not as handsome as somebody this that or the other or maybe you don't feel like you can talk about all kinds of things folks I was one of the worst didn't act like I was brother John I like like but I still had all kinds of complexes I had to prove everything and do this that and the other prove you could do it this side or the other but you know listen whenever God got a hold of me some of that Wishy washing and all that mess got went the Wayside it'll stabilize you can I read it again listen to what he says amen when you finally have the vision catch that vision of the invisible God being present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make you look upward and above the things that are happening around him young or old how many belev that's something we have all learned to do learn to look huh into the invisible realm that's where you'll find it won't find it here don't find it here you you'll find it here right there is where you'll find it close your eyes to the world talk to the one that you don't see with your eyes he's right there amen because he's looking at the Unseen yet by promise amen even Jesus spoke of it in St John 14 when he talked about the branch and so forth am mean a branch that does not bear fruit is cut off because it's withered ain't that right only the fruit bearing the kind that bears fruit and the works of the Holy Spirit shall be able to continue in the vine for the life that is in the vine puts forth the branch and the life that was in Jesus was in uh was in the church first and they did not walk by sight they walked by Faith amen isn't it something that no matter whether it's sickness or things happening everything we we see it we see it with our eyes right not we can see it with our eyes and it affects us so much when you're not supposed to go by the things that you see with your eyes you go by the Unseen you go by what by the promise the supernatural word of God go by the promise of God look to that amen amen praise the Lord they did not walk by sight they walk by faith believing what God Said was the truth Oh What A Difference it is when men who will walk by faith and call anything that's contrary to that amen by sight that's contrary to the word as though it is not we need that type of faith in the church then he talks about aviators and how they fly through the sound barriers y'all remember that the wings like to come off and everything else but once they s past that sound barrier man that that thing that plane just sails on sa on Amen I didn't pull the quote up where I uh Christopher Columbus I believe it was that came over and he was trying to prove that the world was round and so forth and they said man big sea monsters are going to come grab you and man all the guys that were with him and says one of these times man we're going to fall off the edge of it don't keep going what do we do Master brother says say Lord say Lord how many believe that's what we do it doesn't matter what comes it don't matter how bad it looks what kind of monsters come my way say on no matter what trial what tribulation what matter what B comes keep sailing on why because you have closed your eyes and youve looked beyond the Realms of sight amen and you've broke that barrier of sight you're now in the barrier of the Unseen you don't go by what you hear you don't go by what you see taste feel or smell you've broke that barrier now you're sailing smoothly when the next problem comes up well that ain't nothing huh because you've done a lot fought a lot bigger battles than that amen you you love the Lord tonight amen oh my that's right oh if the Church of this day could ever pray till they P pass the sin barrier the unbelief barrier they could shout the victory of the Living God when they once passed that barrier by looking to the Unseen and letting the world vibrate and do what it wants to do I don't care who's Rel likeed next I don't care how much better it gets I don't care oh my they're going to have to Cony Brother Brad they're going to have to come some up some really what I can't even imagine them coming up with something more morbit and and twisted than what they've already come up with amen we were selling a dog yesterday and and people we talk to I was just like wow they're pretty far out there you know and and so forth and I says well and then didn't buy a dog and so forth you know we drove an hour and a half brother Tommy

Paul said bringing every thought captive Amen to The Obedience of the word praise the Lord thank you Jesus for your Supernatural power amen I uh amen two more quotes in a close actually one listen we used to sing in the old church here sing the songs like this I crossed the separating line I've left the World Behind if there ever was a time that the church needs to step across the line which separates you between faith and unbelief by sight and looking at the Unseen by faith it's now how many believe that and I want to say tonight being said it was I don't know what what year it is was

have that meekness that you have that Holy Ghost that you have all of it is not seen that prayer life that you have it's not in the visible world but it's real how many please it's real amen and the believer doesn't go by what he sees he goes by what he doesn't see amen why do you think blind Fanny pra Crosby it didn't matter that she couldn't see amen because she seen a lot of things that people didn't see she themes the the real things if she'd ever got her eyes healed all she just saw was stuff that's not real everything she seen in that blinded state by the Holy Ghost those things were real until she uh wrote wonderful songs amen amen amen let somebody ask him blind Fanny how if you can't see over there how are you going to know how are you going to see him oh I shall know him I

need them beer pieces you can really hear much better amen of what's going on out there musicians would you come amen let's stand Amen brother Jos I'll just sing a song and we'll go so if the musicians will come we'll have a word of prayer before maybe singing that song pull that up if you would I shall know him I shall know him with our heads bowed and our eyes closed Search Your Heart tonight and those that are viewing that are streaming you do the same search your heart I don't I can't read your mind I'm not not a prophet of God I can't discern but the holy spir no doubt maybe during the process of this word he's already searching your heart and pricked your heart in places where you put the Natural Things ahead of spiritual things maybe it touched you of you do it your way you go your way even though you know the word says something different that can apply in every any part of anybody's life only you know but let the Holy Spirit search you right now both out there and here and tonight let's go out those doors different than what we come in if there's something in your life that you want to say God I want to surrender that part of my life right now to you I want to surrender to you Lord I want to ask you to forgive me Lord Jesus where I've I fed good I take so good care of my body but my spirit is lacking my spirit is thin I don't feel like I'm a Christian I

to realize God left you alone because you put other things first Lord we raise our hands God eyes appr preacher it's so easy for me to do too to get so busy with the things of the world I don't have time to study I don't have time to pray I don't have the time to think about you I just love to have time to think about you God help each and everyone here to get more time just to meditate on you and to think about you keep the mind on you Lord and then also to pray to Fellowship to commune with you to listen to your Prophet that you sent to read the Bible that you've given us to feed that inner man there's no reason in the world why you can't be like Paul said strengthen with all might the inner man finally my brother be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and as our Prophet said if there was ever a time that Believers begin to pray until they break that sound barrier of unbel life and the things of the world and the cares of life amen and there'll be a shot of victory in the camp we love you Lord Jesus asking you father to forgive us of where we're not what we ought to be Lord and not
