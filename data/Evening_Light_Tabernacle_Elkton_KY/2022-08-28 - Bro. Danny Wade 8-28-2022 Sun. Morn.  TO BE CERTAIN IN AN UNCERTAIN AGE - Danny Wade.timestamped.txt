[15:15] amen one week and then
[15:17] we're going to have some meetings how
[15:19] many is ready for the meetings
[15:22] amen some special meetings i don't guess
[15:24] we're going to have a big crowd it don't
[15:25] look like this year
[15:27] so i know times it's always changing but
[15:31] we'll just have to wait and see i know
[15:33] that in the last week or even a lot of
[15:34] times a lot of kids they make up their
[15:37] mind up on friday whether they're gonna
[15:38] come or not so but brother john's got
[15:41] wrote down here that he's only got 16
[15:42] kids at this time so that's not a whole
[15:45] lot
[15:46] amen but anyway so that's okay
[15:49] it may be a light load for us i guess
[15:51] but i think more will come hopefully
[15:53] anyway so
[15:55] i think but john said instead of having
[15:57] a meeting he just wants to read this off

[16:01] so
[16:02] now i want to say that of course we know

[20:11] we'll read this uh
[20:13] whole chapter here psalms 86.
[20:18] bow down thine hero lord hear me for for
[20:21] i am poor and needy
[20:30] be merciful unto me o lord for i cry
[20:33] unto thee daily
[20:41] thou lord art good and ready to forgive
[20:44] and plenteous in mercy unto all them
[20:46] that call upon me
[20:54] in the day of my trouble i will call
[20:56] upon thee for that would answer me
[20:59] [Music]

[21:11] glorify thy name
[21:19] teach me thy way o lord i will walk in
[21:22] thy truth unite my heart to fear thy
[21:24] name
[21:33] regret is thy mercy toward me and thou
[21:35] hast delivered my soul from the lowest
[21:37] hell
[21:49] thou o
[21:50] but thou o lord or a god full of
[21:52] compassion and gracious longsuffering
[21:54] and plentiness and mercy and truth
[22:06] this one together show me a token for
[22:08] good that they which hate me may see it
[22:11] and be ashamed because thou lord has
[22:14] helped me and comforted me god bless you
[22:17] may be seated
[22:21] the brian got called out on the call
[22:24] so
[22:26] i figured we'd read here in the
[22:28] scriptures
[22:32] you want to go with me to galatians
[22:41] galatians chapter one
[22:54] and this is paul
[22:56] and we'll read a couple of these here
[22:59] verses
[23:01] paul an apostle not of men neither by
[23:04] men
[23:06] but by jesus christ and god the father
[23:08] who raised him from the dead
[23:11] and all the brethren which are with me
[23:13] unto the churches of galatia grace be
[23:16] unto you and peace from god the father
[23:18] and from our lord jesus christ
[23:22] who gave himself for our sins that he
[23:24] might deliver us
[23:26] from this present evil world according
[23:28] to the will of god and our father to him
[23:31] be glory forever and ever amen
[23:34] and marvel that you are soon removed
[23:37] from him that called you unto the grace
[23:40] of christ
[23:41] unto another gospel
[23:44] and this is kind of what i was
[23:45] hit on this morning but uh
[23:48] tommy had a bible study going over there
[23:51] and it kind of
[23:53] well he invites lots of people
[23:55] and
[23:57] and so there's kind of a mixed multitude
[23:58] there
[24:00] and so they pick a topic a different
[24:02] topic every week to
[24:04] try to focus on
[24:10] and one of the the other brothers there
[24:12] he
[24:13] he said
[24:15] that
[24:16] the topic should be discernment in
[24:18] prophecy
[24:20] and so up to this point we just kind of
[24:22] go along reading the word and focusing
[24:25] uh you know on the scriptures
[24:28] and then how it went
[24:29] uh
[24:31] one the last monday night actually is
[24:33] out but uh
[24:36] so
[24:38] it's hard to go into uh discernment and
[24:41] prophecy without bringing up what
[24:43] happened in our day with with brother
[24:45] branham
[24:46] so we kind of were feeling our way into
[24:48] it
[24:49] and uh so the topic of brother branham
[24:51] we
[24:52] we tried to tell him that god sent a
[24:54] prophet in this day to turn the hearts
[24:56] of the children back to the fathers
[24:58] and it didn't go very good at all so
[25:02] it went pretty rough
[25:04] and uh
[25:05] and it was going pretty rough sit for
[25:08] several days there
[25:09] because
[25:10] but really what it comes down to is if
[25:12] god don't open their eyes
[25:14] they won't ever see it just like i can
[25:16] never see like they see i can never go
[25:18] back and see what
[25:20] how they see it now they can't see how i
[25:23] see it
[25:24] or how we see it unless god opens their
[25:26] eyes
[25:28] so
[25:30] we don't preach another gospel than what
[25:32] paul preached
[25:33] uh
[25:35] brother branham said that he doesn't
[25:37] preach another gospel he preaches
[25:38] exactly what paul preached so paul goes
[25:39] on here in the seventh
[25:41] verse to say which is not another
[25:44] move from him that called you into the
[25:45] grace of christ unto another gospel paul
[25:48] says
[25:48] which is not another
[25:51] but there be some that trouble you
[25:53] and would pervert the gospel of christ
[25:56] and that's where we are a lot in today's
[25:59] day
[26:00] they've taken the gospel of christ and
[26:02] they perverted it into their own
[26:03] thinking or their own
[26:05] way
[26:07] but though we and then paul says but
[26:09] though we are an angel from heaven
[26:11] preach any other gospel unto you
[26:13] then that which we have preached unto
[26:16] you let him be accursed
[26:18] as we said before
[26:20] so say i now again if any man preach any
[26:22] other gospel unto you then ye have
[26:24] received let him be a curse so paul's
[26:27] laying it down real thick here
[26:29] telling the people
[26:32] if anybody comes and preaches anything
[26:33] else then whatever
[26:35] pretty preach to you let him be a curse
[26:37] for do i now persuade men or god or do i
[26:40] seek to please men for if i yet pleased
[26:43] men i should not be the servant of
[26:45] christ
[26:47] but i certify you brethren that the
[26:50] angel which was pre or that the gospel
[26:52] which was preached of me is not after
[26:54] man
[26:55] for neither received it of man neither i
[26:58] was i taught
[26:59] it
[27:00] but by the revelation of jesus christ
[27:04] and
[27:05] and so
[27:07] i guess the thought came
[27:09] that how blessed we are to have our eyes
[27:11] open and are able to see
[27:14] because just like
[27:16] you can take them to scripture after
[27:17] scripture after scripture and they'll
[27:20] and on many different things on many
[27:22] different doctrines water baptism
[27:25] lots of different ones
[27:27] the the women preachers the cutting of
[27:29] the hair
[27:31] the dress
[27:33] the serpency all these different topics
[27:36] they won't see it you can take them to
[27:38] scripture then you they say well
[27:40] you can take them to another scripture
[27:42] well
[27:43] and on and on it goes
[27:45] and then
[27:47] you know they i this i think they look
[27:49] at us they say well they're a little
[27:51] weird because they believe you know that
[27:53] god sent a prophet
[27:55] well
[27:56] my thought is they're a little weird
[27:58] because because they're they're
[28:00] expecting that it god all through the
[28:02] bible send prophets to straighten things
[28:04] out
[28:05] but here in the last day the most
[28:07] confusion of all days
[28:10] they think they're smart enough and rich
[28:13] enough
[28:14] that they don't need nobody to sort them
[28:16] out
[28:17] with with just 10 different people or
[28:19] five different people at a table you
[28:21] have five different interpretations of
[28:23] the same words
[28:25] so yeah we needed a prophet to
[28:27] straighten the situation now and he did
[28:30] straighten it down he didn't add nothing
[28:31] to nor did he take nothing away
[28:34] and
[28:36] he did give it to us straight so it does
[28:38] hurt sometimes but i'd rather have it
[28:40] straight
[28:41] and get it straight here than have to
[28:43] worry about it over on the other side
[28:46] so it's just uh
[28:48] so uh i guess pray for us because
[28:52] hopefully it was called off because of
[28:54] all the stuff that was said but
[28:56] maybe they have it another at least
[28:58] another monday night so
[29:01] try not to be too pushy or strong just
[29:03] like said
[29:04] it's it's got to be god that reveals it
[29:07] because just as loud just what the rich
[29:10] man jesus had the
[29:13] parable or that story of the rich man
[29:15] actually story of the rich man where he
[29:16] said he lifted up his eyes in hell he
[29:18] said for well could you please send
[29:21] someone back one from the dead could you
[29:23] send lazarus back from the dead and
[29:25] abraham said they have moses and the
[29:27] prophets he said if one was raised from
[29:30] the dead they still wouldn't see it and
[29:32] you can you can see that because jesus
[29:35] was there doing the things
[29:37] that what the scriptures said he would
[29:39] do
[29:40] and they couldn't see it
[29:42] jesus came today in the same way i just
[29:44] heard brother i'm saying
[29:46] doing the same exact things
[29:49] that was done when jesus walked the
[29:50] earth
[29:51] and the eyes were still closed they
[29:53] couldn't see it the one
[29:55] i just heard him say the one brother
[29:56] said i don't care how many people you
[29:58] raised from the dead i won't believe it
[30:01] he said well it wasn't for you
[30:03] you're not a believer you're an
[30:05] unbeliever
[30:06] but it's just a little
[30:08] thankfulness of
[30:10] the lord opening our eyes and letting us
[30:12] see what he's done in our day
[30:14] and uh i hope it didn't take too much
[30:16] time but
[30:17] uh that's just the thought that i had
[30:19] this morning what a privileged people we
[30:20] are to have the eye sap that god
[30:23] put on our eyes that we could see what
[30:25] we see because if you can't see it you
[30:27] just can't see it
[30:28] but once you do see it you can't unsee
[30:30] it so praise the lord
[30:58] video
[31:11] amen let's sing that little course i was
[31:13] glad when they said unto me let us go to
[31:15] the house of the lord this morning

[1:07:04] according as his divine power hath given
[1:07:08] unto us all things
[1:07:10] that pertain unto life and godliness
[1:07:12] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:07:14] called us to glory and virtue
[1:07:17] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:07:19] great and precious promises
[1:07:21] that by these you might be partakers
[1:07:25] of the divine nature
[1:07:27] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:07:29] this world through lust
[1:07:31] and beside this giving all diligence add
[1:07:34] to your faith virtue divert your
[1:07:37] knowledge into knowledge temperance into
[1:07:39] temperance patience into patience
[1:07:42] godliness into godliness brotherly
[1:07:45] kindness and brotherly and kindness
[1:07:48] charity
[1:07:49] and if these things be in you and

[1:07:55] ye shall neither be barren nor
[1:07:57] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[1:08:00] jesus christ

[1:08:03] blind you cannot see it far off and have
[1:08:06] forgotten
[1:08:07] that sin he was purged
[1:08:10] from his old sins
[1:08:13] wherefore the rather brethren give
[1:08:16] diligence to make your calling and
[1:08:18] election sure for if ye do these things
[1:08:23] you shall never
[1:08:24] follow
[1:08:26] and that's what i want to speak on on

[1:08:39] where this this age is
[1:08:42] so uncertain that the bible says that
[1:08:44] everyone would be deceived except the
[1:08:47] very elect
[1:08:50] if it was possible the elect would be
[1:08:52] deceived but it's not

[1:08:57] living in so uncertain
[1:09:00] that they don't have
[1:09:02] a
[1:09:02] firm foundation they don't have anywhere
[1:09:04] that they stand they don't know where
[1:09:06] they stand people that are agnostic
[1:09:09] just like i don't know
[1:09:10] there might be a god you know i'm not
[1:09:12] really sure i don't really they don't
[1:09:14] they don't really stand anywhere they're
[1:09:15] like
[1:09:17] they're like that
[1:09:19] that house that was built on on the sand
[1:09:22] that gets washed away

[1:09:34] grace of god which is given unto me as a
[1:09:38] wise master builder
[1:09:39] i have laid the foundation and another
[1:09:42] build it there upon thereon but let
[1:09:44] every man take heed how he build it
[1:09:46] there upon for other foundation can no
[1:09:49] man lay that is laid which is jesus
[1:09:52] christ
[1:09:53] amen and
[1:09:57] here uh let's see
[1:10:00] what
[1:10:01] i was talking to
[1:10:03] my friend at the
[1:10:05] uh
[1:10:06] well i have a friend from the gym uh his
[1:10:08] name is chris we talked a while back
[1:10:11] about many things he
[1:10:12] he told me he doesn't he he doesn't know
[1:10:15] if he's
[1:10:17] going to heaven or hell he's he's a
[1:10:18] christian he's been baptized he's spoken
[1:10:21] in tongues he
[1:10:23] he he he doesn't know where he he's
[1:10:25] going he said he said i'm not sure i i
[1:10:28] feel like i'm
[1:10:29] in i'm going the wrong direction like
[1:10:31] what what am i missing
[1:10:34] and what i told him i i didn't feel he
[1:10:37] was ready to know about the message and
[1:10:39] all that i
[1:10:40] because he didn't have his abcs right
[1:10:42] just like what brother branham says how
[1:10:43] are they supposed to learn algebra if
[1:10:44] they don't know their abcs
[1:10:46] but i told him
[1:10:48] and that until he gets the holy ghost
[1:10:50] he'll always feel that way because he's
[1:10:52] always always living in a sinful
[1:10:55] condition
[1:10:58] see
[1:10:59] i tried
[1:11:01] well i told him how he can get the
[1:11:03] baptism the holy ghost
[1:11:06] but well i did i didn't offer like
[1:11:09] i asked him to if you want to go to my
[1:11:11] church and
[1:11:13] well he he would like to but he he
[1:11:16] really can't unless i take him and i'd
[1:11:17] have to pick him up and stuff and
[1:11:20] and maybe he might come here sometime i
[1:11:22] don't know but
[1:11:25] you know i try to get uh
[1:11:27] people to go here if i can
[1:11:30] you know
[1:11:31] and but it is quite far away from where
[1:11:34] we're at and most people don't want to
[1:11:35] drive that far so
[1:11:37] but
[1:11:38] but that kind of hit me because
[1:11:41] he's like 17 years old back when i was
[1:11:43] as
[1:11:44] younger and i was i didn't know i didn't
[1:11:47] know i was always in a constant place of
[1:11:49] uncertainty where i didn't know
[1:11:52] where i was going and i was in a place
[1:11:54] where
[1:11:55] where i thought i could
[1:11:58] well i didn't know if i was going to
[1:11:59] make the rapture or that that's for sure
[1:12:01] that's the one thing i was always really
[1:12:02] uncertain about i was i even had
[1:12:05] uh
[1:12:07] i i thought i was uh just before the
[1:12:09] rapture happens i'm going to repent i
[1:12:11] thought i always had to like have
[1:12:14] things
[1:12:16] um amended and get everything sort out i
[1:12:19] didn't i obviously didn't have the
[1:12:20] baptism of the holy ghost in that time
[1:12:22] and
[1:12:23] and i was always trying to get things
[1:12:25] things together myself i can't do this i
[1:12:26] can't do that and then i kept falling
[1:12:28] and falling and falling and kept trying
[1:12:30] to
[1:12:31] trying to get back up up again and
[1:12:33] trying to
[1:12:34] say you know i was in a
[1:12:36] in a
[1:12:38] cycle um which i believe a lot of people
[1:12:40] are in today
[1:12:41] is a sin cycle where you sin one day and
[1:12:44] then in your pain and the next day you
[1:12:45] stand on your every plan that night the
[1:12:47] same cycle over and over and over again
[1:12:49] rep repeating the repetitive sin every
[1:12:52] single day and then thinking well no uh
[1:12:55] i always thought well at the end of the
[1:12:56] day after i repent from all that now i'm
[1:12:58] good to go and i'm gonna go to heaven
[1:12:59] and then and i'm just going to
[1:13:01] uh
[1:13:02] repent just before i die and i'm going
[1:13:04] to be okay
[1:13:06] death repentance kind of thing a lot of
[1:13:08] people have today
[1:13:12] people have i can live with the way i
[1:13:14] want but when i
[1:13:15] i'm
[1:13:18] deathbed that's why i'm going to repent
[1:13:19] i'm going to make everything all right
[1:13:23] and
[1:13:25] and and it's
[1:13:27] i even had a a plan that well the
[1:13:30] rapture happens i'm going to
[1:13:32] since i know america is going to burn
[1:13:34] i'm going to have a little plan i'm
[1:13:36] going to um steal a car i'm going to
[1:13:38] run
[1:13:39] run out of united states and go
[1:13:41] somewhere like israel or something and i
[1:13:42] was going to somehow i had this idea
[1:13:45] that i could do that when i was like 14
[1:13:46] years old
[1:13:50] i had it all figured out if if if this
[1:13:52] happens
[1:13:54] then i'll i'll be okay because i escape
[1:13:57] the country now i'm not in the country
[1:13:58] it's gonna burn
[1:14:01] but but that's how it is
[1:14:05] we we need to have
[1:14:06] a we need to be certain know where you
[1:14:09] are headed know
[1:14:11] where you stand
[1:14:13] that's that's another thing i really
[1:14:15] gotta
[1:14:17] get out here here today gotta
[1:14:20] hear what brother branham said it it
[1:14:22] said here if the trumpet gives an
[1:14:24] uncertain sound
[1:14:26] who can prepare himself for battle paul
[1:14:29] speaking here
[1:14:30] of course he was speaking to these
[1:14:32] corinthians and many of them were
[1:14:34] soldiers in those days in in their own
[1:14:36] army
[1:14:38] now now the the trumpet gives an
[1:14:40] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[1:14:42] himself you've got to have the certainty
[1:14:45] of anything we got to know whether it's
[1:14:47] right or not
[1:14:49] and now we're living in a day of great
[1:14:51] uncertainty we all know that the day of
[1:14:54] uncertainty and the time of uncertainty
[1:14:58] i don't i don't believe there there ever
[1:15:00] was a time since time first began in the
[1:15:02] garden of eden when sin come in and
[1:15:05] broke eternity into time
[1:15:07] i do not believe there's ever been a
[1:15:09] space of time with so much uncertainty
[1:15:12] as today
[1:15:14] because there there's not even one hope
[1:15:16] left in the natural world today
[1:15:19] now you say well i've seen times i read
[1:15:22] in history when the wars covered the
[1:15:23] earth that is that is true but never
[1:15:27] time when the whole earth would be blown
[1:15:30] to pieces just in one second see and
[1:15:33] such a destruction it'd take weeks and
[1:15:36] hours and so forth now it it takes one
[1:15:38] minute maybe not
[1:15:41] that just a button press and she's all
[1:15:43] over it's awful and they don't have
[1:15:47] uh cuba can and do it herself it it
[1:15:49] don't have to be
[1:15:51] you don't have to
[1:15:52] a little bitty uh hades could do it
[1:15:55] just any little nation that that wants
[1:15:58] to can can set the world completely on
[1:16:01] fire blow her out of her orbit any time
[1:16:04] they want see it only takes one fanatic
[1:16:08] which
[1:16:09] there's tens of billions of them around
[1:16:10] the world to do that
[1:16:12] and and this was brother branham said
[1:16:14] this in 1960 how much more so is that
[1:16:16] today
[1:16:18] and how much more uncertain it is it
[1:16:20] today these times that we're living and
[1:16:23] we're seeing
[1:16:24] everything that's going on it's so so
[1:16:26] uncertain you you better be
[1:16:29] a certain about where you're going
[1:16:31] because
[1:16:31] as in this day it could it could be the
[1:16:34] next minute next hour tomorrow uh we
[1:16:37] don't know
[1:16:38] uh when and it's going these things are
[1:16:41] going to start happening and i believe
[1:16:44] it's going to happen just like that and
[1:16:45] you're going it's going to be like um
[1:16:48] a thing that just has come upon us and
[1:16:50] you didn't even know what happened it
[1:16:52] it's gonna happen in the blink of an eye
[1:16:54] the rapture is gonna take place and the
[1:16:55] bride's gonna be gone
[1:16:59] and in these times you must be certain
[1:17:01] you must know where you stand as a
[1:17:04] believer you absolutely have to
[1:17:07] get that uh
[1:17:09] down you you can't and just keep going
[1:17:11] on hang on and living a life of
[1:17:14] well i don't know admit maybe this and
[1:17:16] that also stand on um know what you
[1:17:19] believe there's many believers even in
[1:17:21] the message that do not know what they
[1:17:23] believe not fully know what they believe
[1:17:26] at least
[1:17:27] they say well i believe the message okay
[1:17:29] do you believe
[1:17:31] um in the serpency that that's like the
[1:17:33] deepest thing ever i've i've
[1:17:35] i know oh people that and i've spoken
[1:17:38] and to people
[1:17:39] well there's one person
[1:17:41] that won't
[1:17:43] say who it is
[1:17:44] she didn't believe the um
[1:17:47] the serpent see
[1:17:48] and that that's a part of the message
[1:17:51] see i believe the whole message but i
[1:17:52] don't believe that part
[1:17:56] i've heard that before and the same the
[1:17:58] same thing with today well i believe the
[1:18:00] whole i believe this bible yeah
[1:18:02] but that you know that part was inspired
[1:18:04] you know
[1:18:05] saying what what um
[1:18:08] brother brandon and um said was
[1:18:12] uh he well he was uninspired or whatever
[1:18:15] he just kind of an idea that you know
[1:18:17] but
[1:18:18] know what you believe and stand on it no
[1:18:22] and that that's why i
[1:18:23] i um
[1:18:25] i believe us as believers shouldn't just
[1:18:27] go here here to to church but do your
[1:18:30] own
[1:18:31] research do your own study of of the
[1:18:33] bible and of the church age book as well
[1:18:36] because if you just is always going to
[1:18:40] church and never actually doing your own
[1:18:42] research your own starting your own
[1:18:45] uh own like even listening to brother
[1:18:47] branham there's a lot of message
[1:18:49] believers that just go to church and and
[1:18:51] that's where they get their whole
[1:18:52] message from and then the rest of the
[1:18:53] week
[1:18:55] and they say well i put god first
[1:18:57] okay
[1:18:58] you put god first but uh
[1:19:00] but then they don't put god in every
[1:19:02] aspect of their life
[1:19:04] and and it's like not revolving around
[1:19:06] their job everything there like this
[1:19:07] thing where it's separation of church
[1:19:09] and state or
[1:19:11] well i got my
[1:19:13] church life here and then the the rest
[1:19:15] of my
[1:19:16] a life
[1:19:18] i i have to myself and i do whatever i
[1:19:20] want to do and no that's not that's not
[1:19:23] where we need to be this morning
[1:19:25] we need to
[1:19:27] know what we believe know where we stand
[1:19:30] and
[1:19:31] and actually
[1:19:33] look for a greater understanding of the
[1:19:37] word
[1:19:38] a greater understanding of this message
[1:19:41] the message of this hour and instead of
[1:19:44] just relying on the preacher to tell you
[1:19:47] and to show you a new
[1:19:50] a new
[1:19:51] revolution and revealing new things
[1:19:54] that god is revealing to to this bride
[1:19:57] and if you if you just sit back and
[1:19:59] expect uh
[1:20:01] to only get a message from from
[1:20:05] the service every service
[1:20:07] and and then that's it
[1:20:11] you got to be more certain than that
[1:20:16] these are uncertain times don't don't
[1:20:18] just rely on on going within
[1:20:21] just doing your duty and and just saying
[1:20:23] i go to church every sunday every
[1:20:25] wednesday that's good enough it's not
[1:20:30] it's a time of uncertainty we have to be
[1:20:32] certain know where we're going
[1:20:39] amen aaron um what uh
[1:20:43] brother branham said here uh see
[1:20:53] well actually
[1:20:57] it's
[1:20:59] it's a spirit that that gets on on
[1:21:02] people that and they get content with
[1:21:04] what they know
[1:21:06] i i know
[1:21:08] enough to get by
[1:21:10] in this day there seems to be a lot of
[1:21:12] complacency
[1:21:13] people don't want to learn things but
[1:21:16] just want to be reminded of the things
[1:21:18] they already know which we need reminded
[1:21:20] of things of course we do that that's a
[1:21:23] part of it it's a part of it but if
[1:21:25] you're never on a if you never really
[1:21:29] getting greater understanding of things
[1:21:31] then you're not progressing you're just
[1:21:32] staying in the same place you're at and
[1:21:34] then you're going back a little bit oh
[1:21:36] let me get back to my place where i was
[1:21:38] because i get reminded of where
[1:21:40] where
[1:21:41] you get reminded and you just go back to
[1:21:43] the same place and then you back up a
[1:21:44] little bit and then go back to the same
[1:21:45] place again
[1:21:47] do you get what i'm saying yeah it's
[1:21:51] it's
[1:21:53] people
[1:21:54] are content with what they they know it
[1:21:57] it was it was this way when brother
[1:21:59] branham was here in in jesus time and
[1:22:01] today you can teach us
[1:22:03] uh you you can teach us
[1:22:05] where
[1:22:06] you can't teach us we're happy with what
[1:22:08] we know
[1:22:10] like the pharisees say oh we have the
[1:22:13] uh what we got the the old testament we
[1:22:16] don't need anything new come on now we
[1:22:18] we got all this
[1:22:20] and they put a period behind what they
[1:22:23] believed
[1:22:25] i believe in this time there are many
[1:22:27] people not just in the late odyssey and
[1:22:29] church
[1:22:30] but also message believers that are
[1:22:32] content with what they know and don't
[1:22:34] seek for a better understanding even
[1:22:37] some that that don't believe the whole
[1:22:39] message because of their personal
[1:22:40] beliefs that's how it is in this day and
[1:22:43] and we can't get to this place of
[1:22:44] complacency and like um
[1:22:48] what what jesus was saying to the
[1:22:51] laodicean church
[1:22:53] that they they
[1:22:55] they say they they lack nothing
[1:22:58] but yet are blind and and all this and
[1:23:00] that
[1:23:02] and and that's how how
[1:23:04] we can get that way if we don't
[1:23:06] if we don't don't seek for a better
[1:23:08] understanding
[1:23:09] [Music]
[1:23:10] we're just simply happy with what we
[1:23:12] know and not actually
[1:23:13] seeking a
[1:23:15] new
[1:23:17] um
[1:23:18] new revelation and from this word if
[1:23:20] you're not seeking something from god
[1:23:23] something new
[1:23:24] that then you'll always say is stay in
[1:23:26] the same place where and where you're at
[1:23:28] and i believe that the bride will know
[1:23:31] and will will know all the the secrets
[1:23:35] and that that's what the bible says is
[1:23:37] all that every secret will be made and
[1:23:39] known unto the bride
[1:23:42] every secret it
[1:23:43] and uh
[1:23:45] every single secret
[1:23:47] that that god has will be
[1:23:49] a known and it says here in
[1:23:52] uh let's see
[1:23:53] uh it's in
[1:23:55] revelations 10 in first
[1:23:58] wait let's see
[1:24:01] revelations
[1:24:03] 10.
[1:24:33] okay um
[1:24:36] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:24:37] seventh angel when and he shall begin to
[1:24:40] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:24:42] finished and he that as he had declared
[1:24:45] to the servants
[1:24:46] the prophets
[1:24:48] see
[1:24:49] the mystery of god shall be finished
[1:24:52] and and so so god
[1:24:55] has revealed all the secrets
[1:24:59] of of of the bible to his bride
[1:25:02] all the secrets and that man that made
[1:25:04] me start thinking what about what about
[1:25:06] the day or the hour that will be a
[1:25:09] revealed when
[1:25:11] when the the um
[1:25:13] churches will be shut down we'll and
[1:25:16] that that's when we'll be like okay
[1:25:18] here it is now now is the time when the
[1:25:20] when the
[1:25:22] uh when all message churches are shut
[1:25:24] down you happen and they're they're told
[1:25:26] you have to
[1:25:27] come into
[1:25:28] this
[1:25:29] new new order of things you have to
[1:25:32] uh
[1:25:33] you have to compromise on your doctrine
[1:25:35] you have to
[1:25:36] to
[1:25:38] forget about the the doctrine that you
[1:25:40] you know you have to compromise on that
[1:25:42] you have to be like well you know agree
[1:25:44] with what we say otherwise you you can't
[1:25:47] open up your churches
[1:25:49] when they do that we know that that the
[1:25:52] the raptures is
[1:25:53] is at hand
[1:25:57] and and it could it happened just like
[1:25:59] that and and and all of a sudden
[1:26:01] and there it is right in front of us
[1:26:05] but are we
[1:26:07] certain of the place where where we
[1:26:10] stand are you certain of the place where
[1:26:12] you stand
[1:26:14] that
[1:26:15] the never failing god never that this
[1:26:18] was a book i was reading the never
[1:26:20] failing
[1:26:22] never failing god never fails
[1:26:25] to deliver more revelation to those who
[1:26:27] want more the bride can never stop
[1:26:29] wanting to know more about the word
[1:26:31] because to her it is the very essence of
[1:26:35] her lovely lord in the early days of our
[1:26:38] message soon after our prophet it was
[1:26:42] god when a denominational person became
[1:26:44] a message comfort they wholly
[1:26:46] surrendered their past doctrine and
[1:26:48] embraced the greater revelation of the
[1:26:50] word if
[1:26:51] anyone is holding on to the doctrine
[1:26:54] from from the baptist church anything
[1:26:56] like that
[1:26:58] there you go
[1:27:00] you cannot be a baptist and a message
[1:27:02] believer at the same time you cannot be
[1:27:04] pentecostal and a message believer at
[1:27:05] the same time you you've got to you
[1:27:07] can't be in the middle you've got to be
[1:27:08] somewhere and stand firm
[1:27:10] and and say
[1:27:11] you can't be like well
[1:27:13] i believe the message but you know um
[1:27:16] this kind of you know doesn't make sense
[1:27:18] get a better understanding of it do
[1:27:20] research read the church age book and
[1:27:22] find it find out the the truth don't
[1:27:25] just stand in the middle and say well
[1:27:27] um the
[1:27:28] baptist taught me this and well i kind
[1:27:32] of you know it makes sense but the
[1:27:34] message also makes sense let me just
[1:27:35] stay in the middle
[1:27:37] better be careful
[1:27:38] can't be doing that
[1:27:40] know where you stand
[1:27:42] it it was a wonderful full time to see
[1:27:45] the power of the revealed word leading
[1:27:47] them as as in every church age before
[1:27:51] these same
[1:27:52] converts soon settle down into certain
[1:27:55] traditional teachings
[1:27:57] when hearts close god cannot lead
[1:28:02] then that next quote sums up most
[1:28:04] medicine message people so very well
[1:28:08] the the attitude of this age is exactly
[1:28:10] what it was then people have it all they
[1:28:13] know it all they cannot be taught if a
[1:28:16] point of truth from the word comes up
[1:28:18] and a man tries to explain his view to
[1:28:21] one with an opposing view the listener
[1:28:23] is not at all listening that he might
[1:28:26] learn but is listening only to a few
[1:28:28] what is being said
[1:28:29] [Applause]
[1:28:31] i mean
[1:28:32] that is exactly right
[1:28:33] [Applause]
[1:28:36] this is what the church agent said page
[1:28:39] 348.
[1:28:42] we gotta we gotta be careful now
[1:28:44] now if if you're you're holding on to
[1:28:47] something i think that
[1:28:49] um
[1:28:50] you were taught from the denominational
[1:28:52] thing that was a little bit contrary to
[1:28:54] what uh to this message you're not
[1:28:55] believing the whole message
[1:28:58] and and therefore
[1:29:00] you're you're missing the mark in in a
[1:29:03] way and
[1:29:05] and and you have to
[1:29:07] stay with it's exactly what the word and
[1:29:10] and brother branham had the revealed
[1:29:12] word of this day he had the revelation
[1:29:14] of of the this this bible is the
[1:29:17] revelation and
[1:29:20] just like um it said it at um just like
[1:29:24] he says is here
[1:29:26] as he had declared to the servants the
[1:29:28] prophets god shows these things to his
[1:29:30] prophets the revelation of this word and
[1:29:33] so if you go on and say well i think
[1:29:34] this and i think that that's contrary to
[1:29:37] that then then you and that's a very
[1:29:40] dangerous place to be stay with the word
[1:29:43] and and stay with with the message and
[1:29:46] and stop trying to get in a
[1:29:49] place where it's
[1:29:51] you're in between and you don't you're
[1:29:52] like
[1:29:53] well i don't know and i don't know
[1:29:56] know where you stand never be in a place
[1:29:58] where i don't know if i'm gonna make the
[1:29:59] rapture don't be in the place where you
[1:30:00] think hey i don't i'm not sure if you're
[1:30:04] not
[1:30:04] sure then you better get your you better
[1:30:07] you you better get into a place of
[1:30:09] certainty other
[1:30:11] wise you'll be with the rest of the
[1:30:13] world in a place of uncertainty i do not
[1:30:15] know where i stand whether where they
[1:30:17] say i don't know if i'm i'm a man or a
[1:30:19] woman and and they get they go so far
[1:30:22] into uncertainty that people are like
[1:30:24] that now
[1:30:26] and
[1:30:27] and we cannot be in a place of
[1:30:28] uncertainty now is the time to be
[1:30:32] certain and stay away with this word
[1:30:35] exactly what they're not not going on a
[1:30:37] uh
[1:30:39] like i was as a when i was younger or
[1:30:43] like i don't know where i say i don't
[1:30:44] know if i'm going to have their health
[1:30:45] and what really woke me up was a time
[1:30:48] when when
[1:30:49] when i believed that i was supposed to
[1:30:51] to die and
[1:30:53] when i thought i was going
[1:30:55] i should have died at that time and that
[1:30:57] woke me up and it made me realize i
[1:31:00] should i shouldn't know where i stand i
[1:31:01] don't know i didn't know if i was going
[1:31:03] to go to heaven or if i
[1:31:04] i was going to go to hell that's a bad
[1:31:06] place to be in
[1:31:09] and sometimes god has to do that to us
[1:31:12] plus in a place of
[1:31:15] where where we almost
[1:31:17] die or something like that
[1:31:19] to get to wake us up to tell us
[1:31:22] to tell us you better know where you're
[1:31:25] going you better know where you stand
[1:31:28] because if you don't know where you
[1:31:29] stand
[1:31:30] then then you're like that foolish man
[1:31:33] who built his house up upon the sand
[1:31:36] because he doesn't know where he stands
[1:31:38] uh when we get in
[1:31:41] in a place of certainty in in jesus
[1:31:44] christ and we know where we stand and we
[1:31:46] stand upon that word and upon this word
[1:31:50] and we say you can say i know where i'm
[1:31:53] going then you're you're exactly where
[1:31:55] he's supposed to be
[1:31:58] but where now is the time to be certain
[1:32:02] and know where you are going
[1:32:05] it is
[1:32:06] vital to be certain and to know where
[1:32:09] you're going and not not be so
[1:32:12] worried about where you're going if
[1:32:14] you're worried
[1:32:15] worrying well i don't know if i'll make
[1:32:17] the rapture
[1:32:19] then you better you better make
[1:32:20] something right you better get on your
[1:32:22] knees and make it right with god
[1:32:25] because you got to be certain in these
[1:32:26] times
[1:32:39] and um well
[1:32:41] now this is another conversation we had
[1:32:43] where
[1:32:44] um
[1:32:45] this is uh
[1:32:47] at some point i was talking to him you
[1:32:49] know that uh chris i was talking to him
[1:32:51] about how messed up this world is
[1:32:54] especially with the lgbtq
[1:32:57] new stuff
[1:32:59] community
[1:33:00] how they're told some people are born
[1:33:04] gay even kids told this
[1:33:06] you want to know something i've i've
[1:33:08] actually seen
[1:33:09] that there there's a little kids
[1:33:12] video
[1:33:14] that they actually show
[1:33:16] them in schools and stuff about um
[1:33:20] this
[1:33:21] gay pride parade uh an anime little
[1:33:24] thing and and
[1:33:26] and it's just a song about uh how how um
[1:33:31] those
[1:33:32] two two people two
[1:33:35] women and together going
[1:33:38] absolutely i was i was like this is so
[1:33:42] messed up these are little kids they're
[1:33:44] like from kindergarten
[1:33:46] they show these things too and it's
[1:33:48] horrible
[1:33:50] little little kids that are trying to
[1:33:52] brainwash
[1:34:01] little kids are told and told this to
[1:34:02] get get them wondering well maybe i
[1:34:04] might be gay and then they start
[1:34:05] thinking about this over time and
[1:34:08] and come to a false
[1:34:11] realization it's true it's a false
[1:34:14] realization just because they they put
[1:34:16] it in their minds to get them to start
[1:34:18] thinking well i might be uh you know
[1:34:21] they start they're looking at the
[1:34:24] other people differently and stuff and
[1:34:26] and because they think well maybe i am
[1:34:30] and
[1:34:31] he told and told and after i said that
[1:34:35] that um
[1:34:36] he he told me he has a relative that
[1:34:39] that is
[1:34:40] gay and said that that
[1:34:43] people do what makes them
[1:34:44] happy i i responded by saying doing what
[1:34:48] makes you happy sometimes has
[1:34:49] consequences
[1:34:51] like if someone said well cake makes me
[1:34:53] happy and they cake every single day
[1:34:58] they might be okay for a few years
[1:35:00] there's maybe but down the road they're
[1:35:03] going to have a lot of health problems
[1:35:06] and would probably die young
[1:35:09] sin has consequences he told me hey well
[1:35:12] they can't help it they they think that
[1:35:15] they were born this way i tell them that
[1:35:18] they're brainwashed
[1:35:21] and and i think he said well how do you
[1:35:23] know
[1:35:24] if they were if they were born in russia
[1:35:27] do you think they would think that
[1:35:30] what what about the 1800s do you think
[1:35:32] they would be gay absolutely not there
[1:35:35] you go
[1:35:38] it's it's true it's just because that
[1:35:40] they brainwashed them to think those
[1:35:41] things
[1:35:43] and and and then the little kids get in
[1:35:45] a place of
[1:35:47] they're trying to get little kids to be
[1:35:49] uncertain of their own genders
[1:35:51] like cut how mad up is that
[1:35:55] in this time of uncertainty
[1:35:58] that they don't even know
[1:35:59] oh
[1:36:01] if they're
[1:36:02] a boy or not or um
[1:36:04] like it's it's messed up
[1:36:19] now in this sermon um
[1:36:22] christianity versus idolatry but
[1:36:24] branham's um said it like this well he
[1:36:27] was saying
[1:36:28] that uh
[1:36:30] i'll i'll read it
[1:36:32] he'll like to say say for instance
[1:36:34] here's the the traffic coming down the
[1:36:36] street at
[1:36:38] 4th this is off the topic i was saying
[1:36:42] broadway and louisville
[1:36:44] zoom zoom zoom
[1:36:46] just
[1:36:47] fast as they can 60 miles an hour across
[1:36:50] the street everybody rushing hustling
[1:36:51] bustling
[1:36:53] one little man walks out there raises
[1:36:55] his hand and and brother
[1:36:58] breaks slide well that little man hasn't
[1:37:01] got enough power to stop one of those
[1:37:03] cars he's got authority
[1:37:05] it ain't his power what well if one of
[1:37:07] those cars would hit him it it
[1:37:09] demolished him but let
[1:37:12] him raise his hand why the driving
[1:37:14] adverts of the car recognized the
[1:37:16] uniform now let me
[1:37:18] say what i'm trying to say here
[1:37:20] is
[1:37:21] is that before you can know where you
[1:37:24] stand
[1:37:25] you have to know who you are and the
[1:37:27] authority that christ gives you
[1:37:29] know who you are as a person so that
[1:37:32] you'll know where you stand
[1:37:37] uh oh brother they recognize that
[1:37:38] uniform break slide why look at his
[1:37:41] authority look what's behind him the
[1:37:43] whole system of the city is behind and
[1:37:46] the law enforcement of the city is
[1:37:47] behind him that uniform represents that
[1:37:50] he he's different yes sir because he's
[1:37:52] an officer now what what brotherhood was
[1:37:55] saying a while back we should be doing
[1:37:58] um we should
[1:38:01] there should be loads of miracles and
[1:38:02] stuff kind of coming from us because as
[1:38:05] what the bible says
[1:38:07] but in order for that to happen you have
[1:38:08] to recognize the authority that you have
[1:38:10] you have to know where you stand as a
[1:38:12] christian in order for you to be that
[1:38:15] person that that god uses in that
[1:38:17] powerful way
[1:38:19] i had to know where i stood and in order
[1:38:21] for me to be a priester up here i didn't
[1:38:23] and nowhere know that this is what god
[1:38:25] called me to and to do
[1:38:28] and and i had to go off of that because
[1:38:30] i couldn't i had nowhere else to stand
[1:38:32] if god didn't show me
[1:38:35] what his will is for me
[1:38:37] if god didn't show me what was for me i
[1:38:39] wouldn't know where i stand and why
[1:38:40] would i stand up here if i didn't know
[1:38:41] if i was meant to be up here
[1:38:45] now uh he hollers stop well one one of
[1:38:48] them cars goes zoom and and just like
[1:38:50] that
[1:38:52] but
[1:38:53] they better not try it and look
[1:38:56] that what what's behind him they'll
[1:38:58] squeal well breaks aside he don't even
[1:39:00] and have to say a thing just raise his
[1:39:02] hand that does it sure his authority
[1:39:05] comes from the law enforcement it's all
[1:39:07] behind him
[1:39:10] and himself he's weak but but that what
[1:39:13] what's behind him
[1:39:16] that's that that star he's
[1:39:18] his dress he's all dressed up in a
[1:39:20] uniform
[1:39:22] that's what what the not not the idol
[1:39:24] but
[1:39:25] what the
[1:39:27] addressed
[1:39:28] let us put on the whole armor of god in
[1:39:31] that helmet of salvation the great big
[1:39:33] shield the size of a door of faith oh
[1:39:36] brother it's
[1:39:37] not what he
[1:39:39] what he is but what he represents
[1:39:42] that's what the officer it ain't it
[1:39:44] ain't that little man standing there
[1:39:46] he's just an ordinary man
[1:39:49] but but what he represents
[1:39:52] it that's a real for for us today
[1:39:56] what what we represent and us see we we
[1:40:00] have no authority of our own flesh of
[1:40:03] our own self
[1:40:04] but the authority that christ gives us
[1:40:07] and then we know where and where we
[1:40:09] stand and we can proceed just like a cop
[1:40:12] has to know who he is otherwise a cop
[1:40:16] would just be any other
[1:40:19] civilian if he didn't know
[1:40:20] where he stood in the law as a person if
[1:40:24] he was just like well i don't know if i
[1:40:27] i don't know about the laws and stuff if
[1:40:30] a cop didn't know about the laws
[1:40:32] then there's gonna be
[1:40:34] it's gonna be a problem and so us as
[1:40:36] christians we have to understand and
[1:40:38] let's just say this for a sentence for
[1:40:40] um for um
[1:40:43] for example
[1:40:45] where
[1:40:46] are um
[1:40:47] where are believers right we're
[1:40:50] um
[1:40:51] let's say we're
[1:40:53] uh let's let's say uh
[1:40:56] let's change that for a second let's say
[1:40:58] that
[1:41:00] we're all uh this is a police academy
[1:41:03] we're up our police
[1:41:05] well
[1:41:06] dude
[1:41:07] if i asked you do you know the law
[1:41:10] and you told me what i don't know
[1:41:13] then
[1:41:13] get out of here go back to law school
[1:41:16] otherwise i'm gonna have to uh teach you
[1:41:19] you better start you better start and um
[1:41:22] read it
[1:41:23] you better start learning
[1:41:24] uh my example i'm saying is if this is a
[1:41:27] police academy and you came in here i
[1:41:29] don't know what i'm doing
[1:41:31] and and you you said well
[1:41:34] um you know i'll give you a book of of
[1:41:38] uh law
[1:41:40] better start studying that that law
[1:41:42] better start
[1:41:44] getting a better understanding
[1:41:46] in other terms i guess
[1:41:49] if i was putting this as like a
[1:41:51] uh police
[1:41:53] place and and and every one of us are
[1:41:56] let's say every one of us are police
[1:41:57] that have graduated and and
[1:42:02] and
[1:42:03] i i'm the the chief let's say i'm the
[1:42:05] chief right now
[1:42:07] let's let's say i'm the chief and i'll
[1:42:08] say ask you
[1:42:10] um well what what do you do when you see
[1:42:12] someone run a red light
[1:42:14] you said well
[1:42:16] i don't know
[1:42:17] but how did you get here well you have a
[1:42:20] uniform on but how in the world are you
[1:42:22] how in the world are you a
[1:42:24] how are you a cop how did you become a
[1:42:27] cop if you don't even know what you're
[1:42:29] supposed to do in that scenario
[1:42:31] what okay let me ask you this what do
[1:42:33] you do when when you see someone run out
[1:42:35] of a
[1:42:36] a
[1:42:37] building with a bunch of money if you if
[1:42:39] you said well i
[1:42:42] i i get get my gun out and i shoot it
[1:42:48] we're going to be in trouble there's
[1:42:49] going to be a lot of deaths happening if
[1:42:51] we just go by what you just said there
[1:42:54] but but what in
[1:42:57] in that
[1:42:58] a police officer is supposed to know the
[1:43:00] law completely from from what one into
[1:43:03] the other they don't always follow the
[1:43:04] law they do things they they do things
[1:43:08] that
[1:43:09] aren't that they're not supposed to do
[1:43:11] and there's bad cops and there's good
[1:43:12] cops
[1:43:13] and if they if but they don't know that
[1:43:16] law
[1:43:17] then they're not going to do what
[1:43:19] they're supposed to do and they probably
[1:43:20] won't be very successful for very long
[1:43:22] because they're going to run into some
[1:43:23] trouble they're not following the angle
[1:43:26] law and they're the ones that's supposed
[1:43:27] to be the upholders of the law
[1:43:30] and and we can say that the same thing
[1:43:32] for for this message if you're a message
[1:43:34] believer and someone
[1:43:35] asks you
[1:43:37] let's say you're you're a cop right a
[1:43:39] cop asks you well is this in that legal
[1:43:42] i don't know
[1:43:43] you're a cub you're supposed to know
[1:43:45] that and and and so if a if someone goes
[1:43:48] and asks you as a message believer
[1:43:51] well it's in the message
[1:43:54] they ask you questions about the message
[1:43:55] and you're just like well
[1:43:57] i don't i don't know
[1:43:59] i don't know no
[1:44:01] you know you'll have to read it yourself
[1:44:04] that's like a cop said saying well i
[1:44:05] know
[1:44:06] i know the the lawyer but
[1:44:09] you have to read it yourself by the law
[1:44:10] but i don't know what it is
[1:44:12] that's why we should know as believers
[1:44:14] what we believe
[1:44:17] we should know exactly what we believe
[1:44:19] in where we stand just like just like a
[1:44:21] police officer is supposed to know the
[1:44:23] law as a police officer should know what
[1:44:26] his authority is and what he's supposed
[1:44:28] to do in these
[1:44:29] certain conditions and us as believers
[1:44:31] are supposed to know
[1:44:33] what we're supposed to do in these
[1:44:34] certain conditions
[1:44:40] and and um
[1:44:42] in that in that way
[1:44:44] we put on the full armor of god that is
[1:44:46] that is our uniform
[1:44:49] that's our uniform as believers
[1:44:53] but our full armor of governor is jesus
[1:44:55] christ yes sir all devils slider breaks
[1:44:59] when they see thee that they they see
[1:45:01] the full armor of god the two baptism
[1:45:03] the holy ghost amen and seed it go
[1:45:06] coming straight from the throne of god
[1:45:08] dressed in the full armor of his
[1:45:10] resurrection amen
[1:45:12] not that you are strong you're nothing
[1:45:16] it's what's behind you why you're dead
[1:45:18] you joined the army you you've joined
[1:45:20] the police force you're going to keep
[1:45:22] law and control of these devils that's
[1:45:25] right you're on the police force whole
[1:45:27] thing's behind you see you are wrecking
[1:45:30] dead you you're nothing you couldn't
[1:45:32] stop any your authority that's being
[1:45:35] given you because you are raised in city
[1:45:38] in heavenly places in christ in jesus
[1:45:40] the devil recognizes that everything
[1:45:42] slides this breaks
[1:45:44] when them hands go uh what's up
[1:45:48] amen and so us as believers we should
[1:45:51] know exactly where we stand we should
[1:45:52] know exactly where we stand with this
[1:45:54] word we should know exactly what we
[1:45:56] believe in this message and that that's
[1:45:58] why i 100 percent recommend for and for
[1:46:01] everyone to have a church age book
[1:46:03] because
[1:46:04] because
[1:46:06] as if
[1:46:07] because that is is the message in
[1:46:10] in word form and it is also
[1:46:13] you can get a greater understanding of
[1:46:14] the message if you get this book
[1:46:17] i got in and i opened up and i was like
[1:46:19] whoa
[1:46:20] you know i'm reading i'm like wow i did
[1:46:21] not know that it's because it's because
[1:46:24] it's in
[1:46:27] because
[1:46:28] in that book you can get a greater
[1:46:30] understanding of the message so that
[1:46:31] you'll you'll know where you stand in
[1:46:34] these uncertain times
[1:46:36] and and that's how it is with this
[1:46:38] message when when there's different and
[1:46:41] quotes and things that
[1:46:43] certain preachers bring up from what
[1:46:45] brother branham said there there's
[1:46:47] there's message believers that take a
[1:46:49] quote and they make an entire doctrine
[1:46:51] out of it that's right there's massive
[1:46:53] believers that do that well brother
[1:46:55] bannon said this
[1:46:56] well
[1:46:57] satan also talked from this bible and
[1:47:00] quoted to jesus and and jesus said well
[1:47:02] the word also says
[1:47:05] and that's how we should be as believers
[1:47:07] when we see someone uh and in the
[1:47:09] message or
[1:47:10] anyone in general say say something like
[1:47:14] well brother brandon said this but
[1:47:16] brother branham also said that too and
[1:47:18] it is and so that that's how we should
[1:47:21] be and know that the bible no
[1:47:26] man should not live by bread alone but
[1:47:28] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:47:29] mouth of god so that is what we should
[1:47:32] live and breathe and and know this book
[1:47:36] completely
[1:47:37] from the
[1:47:38] front to the back and and no whenever
[1:47:41] someone comes up and in and asks you a
[1:47:44] question what do you believe you instead
[1:47:47] of being like well
[1:47:48] i don't know i don't know where i'm
[1:47:50] saying i don't you know you have to know
[1:47:52] and someone asked you a question about
[1:47:54] the message
[1:47:56] now i it used to be words um it was a
[1:48:00] because of me not knowing everything in
[1:48:02] the message
[1:48:04] i i've
[1:48:06] there there was as believers that that
[1:48:08] came in here
[1:48:09] like uh
[1:48:11] jd i didn't know all the answers and
[1:48:13] when he asked questions
[1:48:15] uh you know i was like well you know um
[1:48:18] i don't know i you know read it yourself
[1:48:22] and i realized i need to be a i need to
[1:48:25] know more about this i can't just try to
[1:48:27] get
[1:48:28] other people in this church if i don't
[1:48:30] know what i believe myself
[1:48:32] who am i to say
[1:48:34] well well
[1:48:36] you should believe the message when i
[1:48:37] don't even know the message
[1:48:39] the whole message
[1:48:41] how how are we supposed to stand as
[1:48:43] believers if we do not
[1:48:45] know the whole whole message or how to
[1:48:48] respond to someone that
[1:48:50] that asks questions about the message
[1:48:52] otherwise you're not really standing
[1:48:54] very firm you should be able to respond
[1:48:58] with a
[1:48:59] you should be able to we should be able
[1:49:00] to respond
[1:49:02] with exactly the the right answer
[1:49:05] instead of being like well i don't know
[1:49:08] let me just go read it again
[1:49:12] but when the word
[1:49:14] get gets
[1:49:16] in our hearts and not just
[1:49:19] on paper if it's on our hearts be able
[1:49:22] to quote anything to anyone well
[1:49:26] i wish i could be like that but it takes
[1:49:28] it takes time it takes a lot of reading
[1:49:30] and studying and to understand these
[1:49:32] things or to to have it on your heart
[1:49:36] this there's people in
[1:49:38] in china that they will lock them up
[1:49:41] and for believing
[1:49:43] to
[1:49:46] and and they'll they'll take a bit of
[1:49:48] the bible they'll read this whole book
[1:49:50] and they'll memorize his entire chapters
[1:49:53] there's by heart the
[1:49:55] they'll
[1:49:56] know every baby and they'll be able to
[1:49:58] write it down word for word and and the
[1:50:00] reason for that is because there's there
[1:50:03] is a desperation and for
[1:50:06] the word but we we've gotten into a
[1:50:08] place where we have it all the time and
[1:50:10] now we're taking it for granted
[1:50:12] like uh brother pilot said we take
[1:50:14] things for granted we have it so good
[1:50:16] right now and there's people over in
[1:50:18] different countries that that can't even
[1:50:21] get access to the bible and and they
[1:50:23] memorized it by heart and they they
[1:50:26] and and it's like some eggs smuggling
[1:50:28] around and here's here's a portion of
[1:50:30] the word right
[1:50:31] and
[1:50:32] then they memorize it by heart because
[1:50:34] because it's so important to them and
[1:50:36] they and they know it's so important
[1:50:38] such
[1:50:39] vital information that that if we don't
[1:50:41] know where where we're standing we
[1:50:43] should know
[1:50:44] exactly where we're standing we don't
[1:50:47] seek it
[1:50:48] enough we don't seek a greater
[1:50:50] understanding enough
[1:50:55] and it's it's true we live in in such
[1:50:58] great times and then when things get bad
[1:50:59] all of a sudden where there's
[1:51:00] desperation
[1:51:04] there's only desperation when things get
[1:51:06] bad it's only desperation for the word
[1:51:08] to take into heart only when they want
[1:51:11] to take away the aid from us
[1:51:16] only then are we do we get desperate for
[1:51:19] uh to know the things of god
[1:51:24] i i challenge each and every one of you
[1:51:27] this morning to seek for a greater
[1:51:29] understanding to start reading more
[1:51:32] instead of just having your same habits
[1:51:35] every single day wide i
[1:51:37] read a little bit every day i'm just in
[1:51:39] the same way of course you read a little
[1:51:41] bit and you listen to brother branham in
[1:51:43] the morning
[1:51:45] but really stink for a greater
[1:51:47] understanding
[1:51:50] and and to have a greater understanding
[1:51:52] not only hey do you have to
[1:51:54] re read the word but you've also got to
[1:51:57] listen to what brother branham says
[1:51:59] about it and what
[1:52:01] and and read the church age but i
[1:52:03] believe the church book is a really key
[1:52:06] thing that we're missing in a message
[1:52:08] and people don't
[1:52:09] read it enough that to get a greater
[1:52:12] understanding of this message that we
[1:52:14] believe to read that book you can
[1:52:17] we got no we got no excuses you can
[1:52:20] look it up online church book pdf and
[1:52:23] you'll find it online and you'll be able
[1:52:24] to read it
[1:52:25] it's on there yeah it's it's out there
[1:52:28] it's of our reach but does it take a
[1:52:31] time
[1:52:33] a bad time a time where things start
[1:52:36] crashing down for us to finally realize
[1:52:39] we need to start getting desperate here
[1:52:42] we need to start actually seeking for a
[1:52:45] greater understanding of
[1:52:47] of god and we need to start seeking
[1:52:51] to know the things
[1:52:54] to know what we believe as as message
[1:52:56] believers
[1:52:59] we shouldn't wait for these these
[1:53:00] desperate times these harsh times for us
[1:53:04] to to start to start really seeking for
[1:53:07] a greater understanding
[1:53:09] sometimes it takes a per
[1:53:13] personal some personal trials to get you
[1:53:15] to to believe that to actually start
[1:53:18] getting desperate i i know that by
[1:53:20] experiences things happen and all of a
[1:53:22] sudden you're just really
[1:53:24] praying i wanted to be
[1:53:27] like that every single day start getting
[1:53:29] desperate lord i need you lord lord
[1:53:33] help me to have a greater understanding
[1:53:35] to to really
[1:53:38] get desperate
[1:53:39] when there's not a time of of great
[1:53:43] trial where before all that happens so
[1:53:46] that when it does happen which it will
[1:53:49] you'll be ready
[1:53:51] and you'll know where you stand and
[1:53:53] you'll you'll
[1:53:54] stay with that and you you won't and
[1:53:58] and you won't all of a sudden be
[1:53:59] destined because you're already seeking
[1:54:01] for a greater understanding you're
[1:54:02] already a
[1:54:05] a getting
[1:54:07] getting in that that
[1:54:09] greater revelation that god wants you to
[1:54:12] have and you already have
[1:54:14] so much of the word word in your heart
[1:54:17] so much of this in your heart that that
[1:54:19] in in those times that that you'll know
[1:54:22] exactly how to react to every
[1:54:24] circumstance
[1:54:28] and and we we need to get like the egg
[1:54:30] that this morning to where we're
[1:54:32] really
[1:54:33] in a time of desperation and and i also
[1:54:37] i'm a strong
[1:54:39] um advocate for
[1:54:41] discipline
[1:54:43] and it does take a lot of discipline to
[1:54:45] get like that
[1:54:47] but but that's what why it's called
[1:54:49] discipline because
[1:54:51] usually a parent will discipline you
[1:54:54] when you're young but then when you go
[1:54:56] older you gotta have your own sense of
[1:54:57] discipline in things and
[1:55:01] sometimes god has to do that discipline
[1:55:03] for us i don't want to wait for that i
[1:55:05] don't want to wait for god to to stop
[1:55:07] disciplining me to to
[1:55:09] to start seeking after him
[1:55:12] to start
[1:55:13] actually getting desperate for him i
[1:55:16] don't want to wait till till desperation
[1:55:18] and comes for me to get disciplined
[1:55:20] i want to be disciplined now i want to
[1:55:22] do all that i can for and for god now
[1:55:26] right now let's do it and now so that
[1:55:28] when
[1:55:29] and that um so that god doesn't have to
[1:55:33] discipline us like that and which god
[1:55:35] will chastise us
[1:55:37] but let's chastise ourselves first
[1:55:40] so that then
[1:55:42] so that the chastisement will will be
[1:55:51] when we start forgetting that
[1:55:53] that we're supposed to be in
[1:55:56] disciplining ourselves which we do
[1:55:58] forget sometimes we get a little bit
[1:56:00] forgetful and we start thinking
[1:56:02] like this this sermon
[1:56:05] it will will go go forth and then then
[1:56:08] next couple weeks you'll forget about it
[1:56:09] and it'll be the same old thing again
[1:56:12] until
[1:56:13] until oh oh god uh chastises you to get
[1:56:17] it back to
[1:56:19] that a place of desperation where you're
[1:56:21] seeking after god
[1:56:22] but if we take this word and put
[1:56:25] in our hearts right now in in this
[1:56:28] moment and and and just remind ourselves
[1:56:31] each and every day
[1:56:33] i also say we you should get a
[1:56:35] devotional
[1:56:37] if you don't have one already and stay
[1:56:40] devoted to seeking for greater
[1:56:43] understanding each and every single day
[1:56:47] it's so important in these times
[1:57:04] now here um
[1:57:05] this is last quote i think i'm gonna
[1:57:07] read one from
[1:57:09] brother branham as soon as you receive
[1:57:11] the holy ghost everybody begins to talk
[1:57:13] about you say you you've gone crazy lost
[1:57:16] your mind
[1:57:17] you was going to be a holy roller or
[1:57:20] something like that and then if you
[1:57:22] cannot stand chastisement the bible said
[1:57:25] you become an illegitimate child
[1:57:28] but if you're really born of god it
[1:57:30] don't make any difference what the world
[1:57:32] says or what anybody else says you know
[1:57:35] where you stand and all the devils in
[1:57:37] hell can't upset you
[1:57:39] then you prove it by your fruits not by
[1:57:42] your voice but by your life you live the
[1:57:45] right
[1:57:46] kind of life
[1:57:47] that is so true
[1:57:50] amen that's like
[1:57:52] you by by your fruits by their fruits
[1:57:56] you shall know them so so if if we're
[1:57:59] not living that kind of life every
[1:58:00] single day living for god striving
[1:58:04] to do his perfect world
[1:58:09] then we're not getting
[1:58:11] houston uh
[1:58:13] another place another quote it's on the
[1:58:15] same paper because um
[1:58:17] peter and john
[1:58:19] when they passed through the gate called
[1:58:21] beautiful the lord spoke to them about a
[1:58:23] layman dying there there was no
[1:58:25] uncertainty they didn't have any
[1:58:27] education they didn't have they didn't
[1:58:30] even belong to a church they didn't
[1:58:32] belong to denomination there was no
[1:58:35] uncertainty about their experience they
[1:58:37] had the positive
[1:58:39] then they didn't have money they didn't
[1:58:42] have membership they didn't have
[1:58:43] education but peter said such as i
[1:58:46] i have i'll give it to you in the name
[1:58:50] of jesus christ rise up and walk they
[1:58:52] had hidden power they dressed like other
[1:58:55] men they walked on the street they eat
[1:58:56] like other men
[1:58:58] but they had a blessing inside of them
[1:59:00] that
[1:59:01] give them
[1:59:03] a certainty to know where they were
[1:59:05] standing said i don't have any education
[1:59:08] i don't belong to any church i don't
[1:59:11] know any theology i don't have any money
[1:59:14] the only thing i have i'll give it to
[1:59:16] you if you'll accept it he said well ed
[1:59:19] what is it he said in the name of jesus
[1:59:21] christ and not just stand up and walk no
[1:59:23] uncertainty not stand up and try see if
[1:59:26] you can and move your foot not not stand
[1:59:29] up and try and see if you'll
[1:59:31] get better but in the name of jesus
