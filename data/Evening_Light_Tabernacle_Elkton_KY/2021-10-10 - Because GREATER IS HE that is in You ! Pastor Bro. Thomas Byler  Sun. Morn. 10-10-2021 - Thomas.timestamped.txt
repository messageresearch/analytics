[39:29] uh you know we all serve all knowing god
[39:32] he knows where each one of you are at
[39:34] this morning where i'm at this morning
[39:37] so whatever that need is god knows it
[39:38] and yeah i was reading the devotional
[39:40] this morning were mom a couple of days
[39:43] ahead where brother branham was talking
[39:45] about how we pray
[39:47] you know the most important thing about
[39:49] anything you do when you're praying is
[39:50] you just gotta surrender yourself and
[39:52] surrender your will
[39:54] it's not having a bucket list of things
[39:56] you need it's just surrendering and
[39:57] letting god have his way in his will in
[40:00] your life and i'll just open
[40:02] with a prayer
[40:06] lord god we just come to this house
[40:07] again lord one more time lord to give
[40:10] you the praise and the worship you're
[40:12] worthy of lord
[40:13] we just desire to see you have your will
[40:15] in our hearts and lives today lord
[40:18] praying and believing the lord that
[40:19] you'll have full control over this
[40:21] service lord from the preaching all the
[40:23] way down the singing whatever said or
[40:25] done lord will be done to glorify you
[40:28] lord speak to our hearts this day lord
[40:30] come and have your way in our hearts we
[40:32] so desire to see you lord in this day
[40:35] that we live
[40:36] lord we truly need you lord we just
[40:38] invite you into this assembly lord god
[40:41] we just pray that you'll come and have
[40:42] your way again
[40:44] in thy name we pray amen if you return
[40:47] with me to
[40:49] the 12th chapter of
[40:50] proverbs i couldn't quite remember where
[40:53] troy left off
[40:54] last time i did this in the 119th psalm
[40:58] but we're going to read this these first
[41:00] 12
[41:02] verses in the 12th chapter
[41:06] i've said before you know
[41:08] that when you take something like
[41:10] proverbs and you read proverbs you see
[41:12] solomon's wisdom
[41:14] you know 3 500 years ago and you read it
[41:16] today and you see that same wisdom is
[41:18] just as much applicable for the things
[41:21] we do
[41:21] in life today as it was three thousand
[41:24] years ago and i'll start with the first
[41:26] verse
[41:28] whosoever loveth instruction loveth
[41:30] knowledge
[41:32] but he that hateth through proof is
[41:34] brutish
[41:42] a man shall not be established by
[41:43] wickedness
[41:45] but the root of the righteousness shall
[41:47] not be moved
[41:56] the thoughts of the righteous are right
[41:59] but the councils of the wicked are
[42:01] deceit
[42:09] the wicked are overthrown and are not
[42:11] but the house of the righteous shall
[42:14] stand
[42:22] and he that is despised and hath a
[42:25] servant is better than he that honored
[42:27] himself and of bread
[42:37] he that tilleth his land shall be
[42:39] satisfied with the bread but he that
[42:42] follow with vain persons is void of
[42:45] understanding
[42:47] the wicked desire the net of evil men
[42:49] but the root of the righteous yielded
[42:52] fruit
[42:53] you know the one thing i don't it can
[42:55] all be seeded as brother dave it comes
[42:57] up i'm not teaching sunday school but
[42:59] that one scripture in there you know
[43:02] says a righteous man considereth the
[43:04] needs of his animals so whether you're
[43:06] human or animal god expresses us to
[43:09] treat everything with love and kindness
[43:17] love the lord with all of your heart
[43:18] this morning
[43:20] and it's good to see each and every one
[43:21] out and
[43:23] we have a pretty empty house this
[43:25] morning and
[43:27] brother stephen he's having to work this
[43:28] morning and then
[43:30] the rest of them are gone on fall break
[43:32] so
[43:33] it's good to have you here this morning
[43:35] and
[43:38] i had text brother steve avery this
[43:40] morning and
[43:44] he said
[43:46] well i'll just read you what he said
[43:49] you know me i usually get things messed
[43:51] up
[44:01] said good sunday morning to you as well
[44:03] god bless you brother dave he calls me
[44:05] dave he's one of the few i let do that i
[44:08] always tell everybody my name is david
[44:10] that's what they named me
[44:12] but anyways he said may god bless your
[44:13] church service
[44:15] i miss everyone at the church
[44:18] special group
[44:20] at the evening light tabernacle
[44:23] now i thought well
[44:24] i'm glad that
[44:27] we all made that kind of impression
[44:30] on our brother that he misses us and we
[44:32] miss him too but
[44:34] you know one of these days and but joe
[44:36] made a comment back there he said when
[44:38] he come in this morning and
[44:42] he said you know he said how will it be
[44:44] on that day
[44:46] when we're over there
[44:50] and we don't have any pain
[44:53] you know there's no old age no pain
[44:56] it's just kind of hard for us to imagine
[44:59] and he said you got something to smile
[45:00] about every day
[45:02] you know the world we live in sometimes
[45:05] it's not
[45:06] always
[45:08] there's not a lot to smile about but you
[45:09] know if you have jesus christ in your
[45:11] heart
[45:12] honestly
[45:14] even though we have sickness
[45:16] pains and aches i still believe as a
[45:19] as the bride of jesus christ we have
[45:21] something to smile about this morning
[45:24] i believe that with all my heart this

[1:16:03] blessings in jesus name amen and amen
[1:16:09] amen
[1:16:12] enjoyed the message
[1:16:14] wednesday amen
[1:16:16] i think brother branham brother
[1:16:18] brother ben did good amen and so
[1:16:22] praise the lord always appreciate
[1:16:24] having ministers to help amen pray for
[1:16:27] brother brad he's going to take
[1:16:28] wednesday night for me so
[1:16:30] he may always appreciate his ministry
[1:16:33] amen for sure
[1:16:34] and so
[1:16:36] uh
[1:16:37] maybe before i wanted to just say a
[1:16:39] couple words maybe before i get started
[1:16:42] um
[1:16:45] you know brother ben he mentioned about
[1:16:47] uh
[1:16:48] sometimes you sit there and you
[1:16:51] as a minister anyway you think about the
[1:16:52] preacher what he's saying and
[1:16:54] and we as a minister you think of other
[1:16:58] scriptures and things that go along with
[1:16:59] what he's saying
[1:17:01] you know and he kept talking about he
[1:17:03] and he said you know if you have any
[1:17:05] victory if you're going to have victory
[1:17:06] and overcome it's going to be because of
[1:17:08] what you what comes out of your mouth
[1:17:11] right i thought well where would be a
[1:17:13] scripture for that you know i know that
[1:17:15] jesus used the word any time any place
[1:17:18] he used the word right and he got his
[1:17:20] victory that way but there's also i
[1:17:21] thought of another one over in
[1:17:22] revelation where it says and uh and this
[1:17:25] was not read in chapter 12 of
[1:17:27] revelations verse 11 i believe it says
[1:17:30] when accuser is cast down which accuses
[1:17:32] us day and night before god he says but
[1:17:35] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:17:37] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[1:17:40] i said that's right you know amen
[1:17:42] and so also he talks about amen how that
[1:17:46] he mentioned brother branham saying
[1:17:47] something in the uh church age book i
[1:17:49] believe it is how that a fully
[1:17:50] surrendered person
[1:17:52] amen um
[1:17:54] uh to god is omnipotent
[1:17:57] all-powerful
[1:17:59] it's quite a mouthful it's for us human
[1:18:01] beings isn't it
[1:18:02] amen but i thought about the scripture
[1:18:05] he says you know i think i'm going to
[1:18:06] read it this morning
[1:18:09] where the bible says
[1:18:10] uh
[1:18:12] that it says that and if you have faith
[1:18:15] as a grain of mustard seed nothing shall
[1:18:17] be impossible
[1:18:19] with you amen i thought that's right you
[1:18:21] know a minute how many knows you can sit
[1:18:24] there and you always when i call it
[1:18:25] being optimistic always uh you know
[1:18:28] believe what the preacher is saying amen
[1:18:31] now if he says something wrong of course
[1:18:32] you can't and have can't have confidence
[1:18:34] but being optimistic about preaching is
[1:18:36] a whole lot better being pessimistic
[1:18:38] a lot of time we all know that you can
[1:18:40] sit there and be pessimistic well over
[1:18:42] here it says this or over here it says
[1:18:44] that you'll get a lot out of service
[1:18:46] that way amen
[1:18:47] so praise the lord but we just enjoy
[1:18:49] that god bless you if you will turn your
[1:18:51] bibles this morning to
[1:18:53] uh first john i believe it is first john
[1:18:56] and this morning uh service is going to
[1:18:59] be a center just howard's worshiping him
[1:19:02] amen
[1:19:03] starts worshiping him
[1:19:05] amen and i like the special of a song i
[1:19:08] know a man who can amen aren't you glad
[1:19:11] that you know a man who can
[1:19:14] amen so certainly the songs went along
[1:19:16] with what we were going to speak about
[1:19:18] first john 4 and verse 4.
[1:19:21] amen
[1:19:23] and this is certainly going to be and
[1:19:25] that and i
[1:19:26] a all right and first john 4 and 4
[1:19:31] year of god little children and have
[1:19:34] overcome them because greater is he that
[1:19:37] is in you
[1:19:38] than he that is in the world may god had
[1:19:40] his blessings to the reading of the word
[1:19:42] you can be seated
[1:19:47] i was working this week and just doing
[1:19:49] things and meditating on the lord and
[1:19:51] uh you know and it just began to come to
[1:19:54] me and the thought came to me uh
[1:19:56] of all the great things that god has
[1:19:59] done amen
[1:20:01] the powerful things that god has done
[1:20:04] amen all down through history all down
[1:20:06] through time
[1:20:07] and it made me think ask this question
[1:20:10] is there anything too hard for god and i
[1:20:12] believe brother brandon met him might
[1:20:14] have preached the message that way is
[1:20:15] there anything too hard for god
[1:20:18] amen i mean when you look at what what
[1:20:20] god can do and then i think brother brad
[1:20:23] mentioned
[1:20:24] i even forget already but something that
[1:20:26] would come out of the uh the lake
[1:20:28] against michigan or whatever i'd forget
[1:20:30] what it was but it took over the world
[1:20:33] amen and heard brother i'm saying
[1:20:34] yesterday and he that is in you talking
[1:20:36] about how that god could create so many
[1:20:39] billions of flies or fleas or he could
[1:20:42] destroy the world anyway that he wanted
[1:20:43] to
[1:20:45] he is that great amen
[1:20:47] and so there's nothing impossible with
[1:20:50] god isn't that right
[1:20:51] and so but my title this morning's just
[1:20:53] going to be and i'm going to bring in a
[1:20:55] lot of the is anything too hard for god
[1:20:57] but i want to title it because greater
[1:21:00] is he
[1:21:02] that is in
[1:21:03] you
[1:21:05] amen than he that is in the world amen
[1:21:09] and you know i mean you you can look at
[1:21:11] these couple of different ways but we
[1:21:12] realize that one way that i kind of look
[1:21:15] at this is that
[1:21:17] greater is the one that's on the inside
[1:21:20] of me
[1:21:21] than me
[1:21:22] right
[1:21:24] he's so much greater than the person
[1:21:26] that's in the world one place that says
[1:21:27] you are in the world but you're not of
[1:21:30] the world right so we're in the world
[1:21:32] and you know if we don't have him well
[1:21:35] we're pretty certain certainly limited
[1:21:37] to what we can do so we're going to take
[1:21:39] different examples different stories
[1:21:41] perhaps this morning of uh
[1:21:44] of what's happened in people when god
[1:21:46] was not only
[1:21:48] in them but we want to start with when
[1:21:50] he is with them amen amen then we want
[1:21:53] to talk about how that uh
[1:21:56] you know it's it's kind of a
[1:21:58] uh and we'll find it in saint john the
[1:22:01] tenth round the tenth chapter i believe
[1:22:02] it where it talks about the vine and the
[1:22:04] vine here the branches and so forth you
[1:22:06] know if any man abide not in me so you
[1:22:09] can you can get away from god how many
[1:22:11] believes that you can get away from god
[1:22:14] god doesn't say that he's going to get
[1:22:15] away from you but he does say you can
[1:22:18] get away from him
[1:22:20] amen and so there's a lot of stories
[1:22:23] we'll take with the help of the lord at
[1:22:24] least a few of them of people who got
[1:22:26] away from god amen and how that then of
[1:22:29] course they were no longer overcomers i
[1:22:32] mean those you cannot be an overcomer
[1:22:34] without him
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:37] so praise god
[1:22:39] uh greater is he that is in you than he
[1:22:43] that is in the world what a mighty god
[1:22:46] that we serve let's first talk about the
[1:22:49] old testament i'm going to go way back
[1:22:51] amen and we find how that
[1:22:54] you know in the old testament for the
[1:22:56] most part god was with them
[1:23:00] right
[1:23:01] he was with them not necessarily in them
[1:23:05] but with them
[1:23:07] right a lot of times the holy spirit or
[1:23:10] god's spirit the bible says would come
[1:23:12] on samson it would come on david it
[1:23:14] would come on this one it would come on
[1:23:16] that one right here that holy ghost i
[1:23:18] mean god would come down on him and
[1:23:20] anoint him just like moses his full face
[1:23:23] shone
[1:23:24] that's how much of god that was on him
[1:23:26] you know but there is still an element
[1:23:28] way down in the soul
[1:23:30] amen that wasn't changed yet that's why
[1:23:33] david was a man after god's own heart
[1:23:35] but without a conversion he still had
[1:23:38] that carnal nature that he simply could
[1:23:40] not overcome
[1:23:43] amen
[1:23:44] and so but you know god was with him and
[1:23:47] as long as god even having god with them
[1:23:50] makes them all-powerful in joshua i like
[1:23:54] this when uh in the first chapter of
[1:23:57] joshua god after the death of moses the
[1:24:00] servant of the lord came it came to pass
[1:24:02] the lord spake unto joshua the son of
[1:24:03] none
[1:24:04] moses minister saying moses my servant
[1:24:06] is dead now arise
[1:24:08] and go over this jordan now and all this
[1:24:10] people unto the land which i will give
[1:24:12] them
[1:24:13] even to the children of israel and every
[1:24:15] place that the soul of your feet shall
[1:24:17] tread that have i given unto you as i
[1:24:20] said unto moses from the wilderness of
[1:24:22] this lebanon even unto the great river
[1:24:24] the great river euphrates and all the
[1:24:26] land of the hittites and to the great
[1:24:28] sea
[1:24:29] towers the going down of the sun shall
[1:24:31] be your coast now notice
[1:24:33] here he says this and there shall not
[1:24:35] any man be able to stand before thee
[1:24:40] amen now notice what our scripture says
[1:24:43] our scripture said
[1:24:44] ye have overcome
[1:24:47] them
[1:24:49] now
[1:24:49] who is them anybody that isn't with god
[1:24:53] or that god isn't with
[1:24:56] anybody that is against you
[1:24:59] you will overcome
[1:25:01] as long as you have him
[1:25:03] well i'm here to tell you this morning
[1:25:04] if we get anything out of this service
[1:25:06] it's going to be that we learned the
[1:25:08] importance of having him on board
[1:25:14] now
[1:25:16] oh my so he says
[1:25:18] any man no man shall be able to stand
[1:25:21] before thee all the days of thy life as
[1:25:23] i was with
[1:25:26] moses so i will be
[1:25:30] with thee
[1:25:34] oh my aren't you glad for that aren't
[1:25:36] you glad that you and i have a promise
[1:25:38] that i will never leave you nor forsake
[1:25:42] you even to the end of the world
[1:25:44] i mean it means every child of god every
[1:25:46] born-again person has that promise that
[1:25:49] god promised that i will be with
[1:25:53] amen and that's what we're all so happy
[1:25:56] about that's what makes life life
[1:25:59] you know i came to have life not more
[1:26:01] abundantly because i live all if you've
[1:26:04] got a m you aren't even living
[1:26:08] this morning is about bragging about
[1:26:10] jesus
[1:26:11] there's a woman when come came up the
[1:26:13] brother bam says you know i really
[1:26:15] enjoyed your message but you just
[1:26:16] bragged too much on jesus he was just a
[1:26:18] prophet or you know another good man or
[1:26:20] whatever you know and he was you know he
[1:26:23] wasn't divine or whatever you brag too
[1:26:25] much
[1:26:26] i believe was she said that the only
[1:26:29] fault that i have with you what you're
[1:26:31] saying in your ministry is that you brag
[1:26:33] too much about jesus
[1:26:36] i was pretty happy you know imagine you
[1:26:39] did a little jig
[1:26:40] huh say about praise speak to god
[1:26:43] hallelujah
[1:26:45] if that's all you can find fault with
[1:26:48] and i am pretty happy
[1:26:50] wouldn't you be
[1:26:51] if that's the only fault somebody could
[1:26:53] find was that you brag too much about
[1:26:56] jesus
[1:26:58] amen i'll be glad to announce that i
[1:27:00] don't just brag about him i adore him i
[1:27:04] love him and not only that i plumb
[1:27:06] worship the man
[1:27:10] are you asked god plump worship him
[1:27:13] amen right because
[1:27:15] all before him and worshipped him and he
[1:27:16] said no that belongs to god no he
[1:27:18] accepted the worship
[1:27:21] because they said my lord and my god
[1:27:24] that's what he called him
[1:27:26] because that's what he was
[1:27:28] amen so we're going to brag on jesus
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:31] because he's the only one worth bragging
[1:27:33] about
[1:27:34] and then he goes on to talk about the
[1:27:36] law not departing out of the mouth and
[1:27:38] so forth verse nine i have not i
[1:27:39] commanded thee be thou strong
[1:27:42] strong and of good courage
[1:27:44] be not afraid need to be dismayed
[1:27:48] for the lord thy god is with thee with
[1:27:51] me whether so ever thou goest
[1:27:57] oh i love to tell the old stories don't
[1:27:59] you
[1:28:00] amen whenever moses met god on the back
[1:28:03] side of the desert right
[1:28:05] when he was introduced to him his life
[1:28:07] was pretty bland
[1:28:10] right it was pretty plain
[1:28:13] living on the backside of the desert
[1:28:14] serving her his wife's uh
[1:28:17] father and so forth and working there
[1:28:19] and and doing all that watching the
[1:28:21] sheep until god finally said moses i
[1:28:23] want you to come up to this mountain i
[1:28:25] want to talk with you right from that
[1:28:27] point on his life completely changed and
[1:28:30] when he met that pillar of fire
[1:28:32] when he met god
[1:28:35] oh my aren't you glad you met god you
[1:28:37] met that pillar of fire that's something
[1:28:40] that made a change folks if that don't
[1:28:42] happen in your life all you ever do is
[1:28:45] just come to church and hear a bunch of

[1:29:15] because he did something moses met him
[1:29:18] and then he began to say you know i want
[1:29:20] you to go down there and i want you to
[1:29:22] deliver my people
[1:29:24] and what did moses say i am insufficient
[1:29:28] i can't do it i i i can't do it
[1:29:32] folks i want you to know when you get to
[1:29:33] that place and you realize you can't do
[1:29:35] it but god says don't you worry i'm
[1:29:38] gonna be with you didn't he say i'm
[1:29:40] gonna be with you moses you ain't going
[1:29:42] down there alone
[1:29:45] how are they gonna know that you know
[1:29:47] that i'm son of god he says what do you
[1:29:49] got in your hand huh take this stick he
[1:29:52] had a stick in his hand calling the
[1:29:53] staff and then he says you know about
[1:29:55] this you're going to deliver israel
[1:29:58] and i just take this dick and so forth
[1:30:00] and go down that you
[1:30:02] your stick and me and we're going to do
[1:30:04] the job
[1:30:08] my man knows i ain't no job too big for
[1:30:11] god
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:16] amen
[1:30:17] all right brother dave i think you might
[1:30:19] saw
[1:30:20] all right i love you amen but
[1:30:22] amen praise the lord
[1:30:24] uh but anyway listen so amen there he
[1:30:27] was and he said i can't do it
[1:30:31] but i know that he can
[1:30:33] and he had to get that over to to moses
[1:30:35] look i'm with you
[1:30:38] we're a majority
[1:30:43] let me ask you something
[1:30:47] well let me tell you something
[1:30:49] you know where you would be
[1:30:51] if it wasn't for god
[1:30:54] controlling and being in your life
[1:30:56] you would be like samson
[1:30:59] after
[1:31:00] he disobeyed god
[1:31:02] let me know because samson is an example
[1:31:05] of leaving god
[1:31:07] i didn't leave him samson was the one
[1:31:10] that disobeyed he's the one to cut his
[1:31:11] hair give away secret
[1:31:14] and that right and because of it
[1:31:17] he was down there at the mill grinding
[1:31:20] going around and around with his eyes
[1:31:23] out miserable
[1:31:25] being mocked oh they didn't figure drums
[1:31:29] out no they wanted him to hear them
[1:31:32] laughing at him and their god
[1:31:36] and he's god he was a complete mockery
[1:31:39] he was in complete prison how many knows
[1:31:42] that's why we wouldn't be if it wasn't
[1:31:44] for god in our life
[1:31:47] that's right a terrible place
[1:31:51] but moses went down and all he did was
[1:31:53] follow christ
[1:31:55] he was an example of somebody that was
[1:31:57] completely surrendered to god
[1:31:59] isn't that right
[1:32:01] come on folks are you with me
[1:32:03] completely surrendered to god so there
[1:32:05] was nothing
[1:32:06] impossible with him
[1:32:08] with god nothing is impossible
[1:32:13] aren't you glad for that
[1:32:16] man i'm here to tell you
[1:32:17] we truly should be the happiest people
[1:32:20] on the face of the earth
[1:32:22] amen
[1:32:23] don't you just love him
[1:32:26] amen
[1:32:28] in matthew 17 and 20 it says it this way
[1:32:32] and jesus says unto them well they go to
[1:32:35] 19. then came his disciples to jesus
[1:32:37] apart and said why could not we cast him
[1:32:40] out and jesus says unto them because of
[1:32:42] your unbelief for verily i say unto you
[1:32:45] if you have faith as the greatness of a
[1:32:46] mustard seed you shall say unto this
[1:32:49] mountain remove hands and move yonder
[1:32:52] and young in the out to younger place
[1:32:55] and it shall remove for and nothing
[1:32:58] shall be impossible unto you
[1:33:05] all
[1:33:06] right maybe we've said it a hundred
[1:33:09] times
[1:33:10] maybe preachers have said it 100 times
[1:33:12] but i want to say it one more time
[1:33:14] and maybe in just a little bit different
[1:33:15] ways so put this in your hard drive
[1:33:18] are you ready
[1:33:20] remember this when you face
[1:33:22] impossible odds
[1:33:24] impossible things in your life
[1:33:27] things that look like it could never be
[1:33:29] fixed it could be you can't get over it
[1:33:31] you can't get under you can't get around
[1:33:33] it
[1:33:35] and it it may be completely different
[1:33:38] unlike anything you've ever seen maybe
[1:33:39] it's not a mountain being removed maybe
[1:33:41] it's a tumor maybe it's cancer maybe
[1:33:43] it's whatever it is remember this no
[1:33:45] matter what it is
[1:33:48] if you have him with you
[1:33:50] greater is he that is in you than he is
[1:33:53] in the world there is nothing that you
[1:33:55] can't conquer
[1:33:59] how he believes that
[1:34:01] no matter how big it is
[1:34:04] no matter how hard the problem as long
[1:34:07] as he is there
[1:34:09] it's not you doing it
[1:34:13] most of our problem is right the battle
[1:34:15] that we face is conquering ourself
[1:34:20] that's the giant many times
[1:34:22] is completely being able to surrender to
[1:34:25] almighty god
[1:34:27] and let him do it i like that
[1:34:30] think about it
[1:34:31] no matter what the problem i don't care
[1:34:33] if it's uh you know
[1:34:34] you know
[1:34:35] look at what god had moses to do yet
[1:34:38] perhaps him to do things and that hadn't
[1:34:40] been done before call flies call for
[1:34:43] fleas call for frogs call for the water
[1:34:46] to be turned into blood i mean he didn't
[1:34:48] care god didn't care what it took he was
[1:34:50] going to get the job done
[1:34:53] god will not fail
[1:34:56] if you are in the line of duty god will
[1:34:59] not fail
[1:35:02] and folks i want you to know something
[1:35:04] if you are continuously failing remember
[1:35:07] that ain't god
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:11] no it's not god if you're always failing
[1:35:14] if you're never having the victory if
[1:35:16] you're
[1:35:17] achieving your purpose it's not god
[1:35:21] that's something that you're doing you
[1:35:22] have gotten yourself into it
[1:35:27] judge your life of whether it is a life
[1:35:30] a victory or a life of defeat
[1:35:34] that's pretty good
[1:35:35] it don't matter what it is folks
[1:35:38] i've it's just you know it's
[1:35:40] something the lord's showing me fresh
[1:35:44] amen because god
[1:35:46] he never is defeated
[1:35:49] you think pharaoh
[1:35:52] you did the story the story would be
[1:35:53] completely different
[1:35:55] no the israelites they stayed captives
[1:35:58] and god just
[1:35:59] forgot about he couldn't do it
[1:36:01] huh
[1:36:02] didn't even even moses used that against
[1:36:06] god one time
[1:36:08] right when god was ready to destroy them
[1:36:10] all said just separate yourself i'll
[1:36:12] destroy a whole bunch
[1:36:14] and moses says no don't do that because
[1:36:16] then the heathens will say that he
[1:36:18] wasn't able to take him on
[1:36:21] huh and so god says i right
[1:36:25] but the story is how many believe god is
[1:36:28] more than able
[1:36:30] and the thing of it is if god is able to
[1:36:33] do anything
[1:36:35] if he is in you
[1:36:37] then you can
[1:36:39] conquer
[1:36:40] go through anything
[1:36:43] isn't that powerful
[1:36:45] greater is he that is in you
[1:36:48] than he that is in the world
[1:36:51] all right let's take a few of people
[1:36:53] who who didn't have god with him
[1:36:57] now we we all know are very very
[1:37:00] familiar with the message brother man
[1:37:01] preached on that people in this age
[1:37:03] these churches
[1:37:05] they're doing god a service without it
[1:37:08] being his will
[1:37:09] god isn't with them
[1:37:12] no you wouldn't have homosexuals you
[1:37:13] wouldn't have women cutting their hair
[1:37:15] and wearing makeup looking like
[1:37:17] prostitutes walking in their doors if
[1:37:19] god was with him
[1:37:21] huh
[1:37:22] no no no no listen
[1:37:26] so there we find that people think that
[1:37:28] god is with him sometimes when he's not
[1:37:32] let's just i wanted to take samson
[1:37:34] because samson was an example
[1:37:36] that god was at one time with him
[1:37:39] right
[1:37:40] and with god with him it didn't matter
[1:37:43] oh my sometimes we think we have so
[1:37:46] little to work with here
[1:37:49] well you know if i
[1:37:51] you know if i could have a million
[1:37:53] dollars i could be a missionary and i
[1:37:54] could do missionary work if i was a
[1:37:56] great preacher i could do this or if i
[1:37:58] you know no no no if you just have god
[1:38:00] with you it doesn't matter if all you
[1:38:02] have is in your hand is a jawbone of a
[1:38:05] meal
[1:38:06] you can conquer everything that's in
[1:38:08] front of you
[1:38:09] it doesn't matter what you have you have
[1:38:11] to have very little
[1:38:13] promise god is in it
[1:38:15] just like moses that stick that's all he
[1:38:17] really really really needed now stretch
[1:38:19] forth thy sap amen into the red sea and
[1:38:22] it'll part right it wasn't the stick
[1:38:24] coming it wasn't this thick it wasn't
[1:38:26] moses it was god in moses
[1:38:31] oh my
[1:38:33] praise be to god
[1:38:36] so samson we realized that he got away
[1:38:38] from god
[1:38:40] he got away from god and all of a sudden
[1:38:44] it was defeat
[1:38:46] after defeat
[1:38:48] after defeat
[1:38:54] how many know any when everything starts
[1:38:56] going wrong i begin to say lord did i do
[1:38:59] something wrong somewhere
[1:39:02] how many's with me if this goes wrong
[1:39:04] and that goes wrong and this goes wrong
[1:39:05] and that
[1:39:06] what if i miss it here
[1:39:09] you know
[1:39:13] oh my and i we realize god allows you to
[1:39:16] go through trials
[1:39:18] but one thing's for sure if you're in
[1:39:20] his will god will take you out the other
[1:39:22] side he'll bring out the other side
[1:39:27] folks brother john all of us i would be
[1:39:29] a complete wreck beside the road
[1:39:32] i'd be somewhere who knows where
[1:39:36] if it wasn't for god's hand on my life
[1:39:39] you would be too
[1:39:42] we'd be complete wrecks if it wasn't for
[1:39:44] god's and on our lives
[1:39:47] to take us through the trials that we go
[1:39:49] those hard times those emotional times
[1:39:51] that we have those those oh my those
[1:39:54] great trials that god allows to come our
[1:39:56] way
[1:39:59] amen but boy i'll tell you all right we
[1:40:02] real quick gravity
[1:40:04] that is in you
[1:40:06] now if he is not in you let's talk about
[1:40:08] that for a minute
[1:40:10] you do your own thing you have a plan
[1:40:12] like let's go with another how about
[1:40:14] nathan cora how about korra or was it
[1:40:16] dayton remember and he says moses you
[1:40:18] take too much upon yourself
[1:40:21] and he did something in himself
[1:40:24] right
[1:40:25] man we're religious too we're only two
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:30] now was god with him no god was not with
[1:40:33] him
[1:40:35] and what he ended up he ended up getting
[1:40:37] his whole family swallowed up in the
[1:40:39] earth
[1:40:40] everybody around him that took sides
[1:40:42] with him destroyed
[1:40:45] that wasn't god
[1:40:47] that was just him getting away from the
[1:40:49] god or god ordained way
[1:40:51] same way with samson he disobeyed god
[1:40:53] and i want you to know something
[1:40:55] you can't really have how many knows you
[1:40:57] can't have confidence towards god if
[1:40:59] you're doing things that is contrary to
[1:41:01] his word
[1:41:03] can't disobey god and expect god to just
[1:41:06] keep on blessing you
[1:41:08] no we got to be obama's we got to be
[1:41:10] obedient
[1:41:12] god demands obedience samson was an
[1:41:14] obedient and what look when god left him
[1:41:17] boy he became a complete uh
[1:41:20] calamity he was terrible things that
[1:41:22] went with him amen same way with nathan
[1:41:25] he was on the road he was riding with
[1:41:27] the group he was praising the lord with
[1:41:29] miriam and allah oh man until
[1:41:33] he
[1:41:34] left
[1:41:35] god
[1:41:38] amen
[1:41:40] and did his own thing that's what
[1:41:42] happens amen when you do your own thing
[1:41:48] remember israel i believe it was ahab
[1:41:50] and
[1:41:51] that wanted to go up and take a certain
[1:41:53] portion of land
[1:41:54] and they consulted micah micah says go
[1:41:56] on up but i seen israel scattered like
[1:42:00] sheep having no shepherd and so forth
[1:42:02] they went up there without the lord even
[1:42:05] though there are gods people in the land
[1:42:07] belong to them but they did something
[1:42:08] that the lord didn't tell them to do
[1:42:11] and god was not with them
[1:42:14] and they got killed didn't they
[1:42:17] they got scattered because they did
[1:42:19] something
[1:42:20] did something that the lord wasn't with
[1:42:22] folks i want you to know right now don't
[1:42:25] you leave the lord
[1:42:27] don't leave the lord
[1:42:29] otherwise calamity will strike
[1:42:32] things will go terribly wrong you won't
[1:42:34] have any victories no matter what you do
[1:42:36] it'll be defeat after defeat after
[1:42:39] defeat
[1:42:40] after defeat think of all the times that
[1:42:42] israel got away from god and then the
[1:42:44] enemies would come and take him captive
[1:42:47] amen
[1:42:50] my
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:54] now
[1:42:55] that was those those those times back
[1:42:58] there with samson with israel
[1:43:02] with nathan and so forth
[1:43:04] in the new testament it was the seven
[1:43:06] sons of siva that we can take as an
[1:43:08] example of he wasn't with them
[1:43:11] they were copycats they thought they
[1:43:13] could just not have down in here what
[1:43:15] paul had and what jesus had so when they
[1:43:18] went to casting out those devils they
[1:43:20] says we know who paul is because we know
[1:43:22] who's with them i mean it wasn't just
[1:43:25] paul it was who was with paul
[1:43:29] and they knew jesus well
[1:43:31] right they know the holy ghost
[1:43:33] but these guys didn't have the holy
[1:43:35] ghost so they tried to impersonate to do
[1:43:37] something they did
[1:43:38] and god didn't even protect him did he
[1:43:41] jesus did not even protect him let me
[1:43:43] tell you something when you're in the
[1:43:44] line of duty god protects you
[1:43:47] you have his protection that's why you
[1:43:50] don't have to fear anything
[1:43:53] don't be don't fear don't be dismayed
[1:43:56] for i am with you
[1:44:00] praise the lord how many believe that
[1:44:03] over in john the 14th chapter and verse
[1:44:07] 16 i'll start
[1:44:09] i will pray the father and he shall give
[1:44:11] you another comforter that he may abide
[1:44:14] with you forever
[1:44:18] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:44:21] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:44:24] neither knoweth him but ye know him
[1:44:27] for he dwelleth with you
[1:44:29] amen how many please when jesus was
[1:44:32] there with them
[1:44:34] their clear distinction that he is now
[1:44:37] with them
[1:44:39] and shall be
[1:44:42] in you
[1:44:46] there is a world of difference
[1:44:49] there is a world of difference between
[1:44:51] him being with you
[1:44:53] and in you
[1:44:55] if he's here beside you sure he'll guard
[1:44:57] you he'll protect you he's with you
[1:44:59] but when he comes on here we know there
[1:45:01] has to be a work done before he ever
[1:45:04] makes his abode in your heart
[1:45:07] amen because man they knew him the
[1:45:09] disciples do it but they did not know
[1:45:11] the love of god
[1:45:12] even peter and them you know what to
[1:45:14] kill anybody that wait contrary to him
[1:45:17] and so forth god obviously and
[1:45:18] everything else but when he comes in
[1:45:20] here you have the same love you have the
[1:45:22] same feeling that god himself does
[1:45:24] because he is not just with you now but
[1:45:27] he is
[1:45:29] in you
[1:45:32] i don't believe we can ever over
[1:45:33] emphasize
[1:45:34] this enough
[1:45:38] no
[1:45:39] it's christ the mystery what was christ
[1:45:41] the mystery which was hid from other
[1:45:43] ages and so forth it's christ in you
[1:45:45] the hope of glory that's the great
[1:45:46] mystery
[1:45:48] christ
[1:45:49] in
[1:45:51] you
[1:45:53] so he says and shall be in you
[1:45:56] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[1:46:00] come to you
[1:46:03] yet a little while when the world sees
[1:46:05] me no more but you see me because i live
[1:46:08] ye shall live also aren't you glad to
[1:46:10] live amen he lives you live and at that
[1:46:14] day you shall know that i am in my
[1:46:16] father you are in me and i am you
[1:46:21] praise be to god
[1:46:23] it brings us again to the true meaning
[1:46:25] of what our prophet taught us that is he
[1:46:28] says if you have the holy ghost on the
[1:46:30] inside of your heart when you're born
[1:46:32] again and when you have the holy ghost
[1:46:35] you have everything that you will ever
[1:46:39] need
[1:46:41] in this life's journey and what else
[1:46:46] thank you
[1:46:47] and in the world to come because how
[1:46:50] many of those a lot of us are dead are
[1:46:52] getting older we're getting older now
[1:46:53] we've got to realize and then the next
[1:46:55] decade hey there's perhaps amen you're
[1:46:58] going to have to face one of the biggest
[1:47:00] challenges of your whole life
[1:47:04] that's death itself
[1:47:07] you're gonna have to face
[1:47:08] death
[1:47:10] amen
[1:47:14] amen
[1:47:15] and you can do it
[1:47:16] unless you can do it
[1:47:19] with as long as he's in here it'll be
[1:47:22] all right
[1:47:23] how many believes it'll be all right
[1:47:27] amen because i tell you i've realized i
[1:47:29] believe we as christians need to know
[1:47:31] this for sure that all it is is stepping
[1:47:33] from this dimension into the other
[1:47:35] dimension
[1:47:36] amen it's taking your last breath here
[1:47:39] but it's not the end it's taking you
[1:47:40] first over there
[1:47:42] amen it's not as bad it's not bad amen
[1:47:45] not for a believer it isn't
[1:47:48] it's the most glorious thing for a
[1:47:49] believer
[1:47:51] but it's scary amen
[1:47:53] but still it'll be a challenge it's to
[1:47:55] check you out make sure whether you're
[1:47:56] right or not
[1:47:58] amen let me say something else this
[1:48:00] morning about
[1:48:01] about this i wanted to kind of do this
[1:48:03] at the end but i'm just going to go as
[1:48:04] it comes
[1:48:06] there is no rapture
[1:48:09] there is no rapture unless it is him
[1:48:13] in you
[1:48:16] you'll be left in the tribulation period
[1:48:18] to be punished
[1:48:20] to listen to the sounds of those
[1:48:22] nuclears
[1:48:24] i was laying in the bed thinking this
[1:48:25] morning i believe it was of those who
[1:48:27] missed the rapture and those who
[1:48:29] experienced those atomic bombs going off
[1:48:34] i had to think this i had to think
[1:48:36] probably you won't even die from that
[1:48:39] heat that's hotter than the sun
[1:48:43] you know how hot a nuclear bomb is i
[1:48:46] understand it's hotter in the sun it's
[1:48:48] very very hot
[1:48:50] but just uh
[1:48:52] what do you call that wave that comes
[1:48:55] yeah just that would probably kill you
[1:48:57] long before you ever felt the heat does
[1:49:00] that throw you so far
[1:49:02] right
[1:49:03] probably kill most of people unless
[1:49:05] you're in the building somewhere in the
[1:49:06] fire
[1:49:08] but folks
[1:49:09] you don't have to worry about that
[1:49:10] aren't you glad
[1:49:12] but there's no rapture unless he is in
[1:49:15] you now how many knows what brother
[1:49:16] braham talked about the token
[1:49:18] what is he it's when he has supreme
[1:49:21] control in here
[1:49:23] he said the literal life the song says
[1:49:25] like israel he says when i see the blood
[1:49:27] i will pass over you
[1:49:29] now it's not just the literal blood but
[1:49:31] it's the life that was in the blood
[1:49:33] which is him
[1:49:35] unless he is living his life out through
[1:49:39] you
[1:49:40] don't expect to go because it's the only
[1:49:42] thing that is accepted the only thing
[1:49:45] that god accepts is christ's life in you
[1:49:49] now he that hath not the spirit of god
[1:49:52] paul said is none of his
[1:49:54] you have to have the holy ghost in your
[1:49:57] soul not just your flesh and spirit but
[1:50:00] down in your soul you have to have him
[1:50:02] down here in order to take a rapture
[1:50:06] i mean please we have another big
[1:50:08] challenge
[1:50:10] this is the challenge i want to face
[1:50:11] brother irvin
[1:50:13] i want to challenge
[1:50:16] oh my
[1:50:18] and we can do it i mean there's nothing
[1:50:20] you can't do without him aren't you glad
[1:50:22] for that doesn't that make you happy to
[1:50:23] know that no matter young people listen
[1:50:25] if you've got him on board remember no
[1:50:27] matter what comes
[1:50:29] don't get irated don't fall don't go go
[1:50:32] crazy about no just surrender it to god
[1:50:34] say god i know you can handle this
[1:50:38] and then watch him handle it
[1:50:42] i'm here to tell you folks i am sorry to
[1:50:44] say this but i have seen way too many
[1:50:46] people try to make things happen
[1:50:48] themselves and bitterly failed because
[1:50:52] he was themselves
[1:50:54] committed to god say god you take care
[1:50:56] of it keep my dirty hands off of it sure
[1:50:59] as you get your dirty hands in it you
[1:51:00] are going to feel bitterly
[1:51:03] because god ain't going to be with you
[1:51:06] amen
[1:51:08] now where was i
[1:51:11] amen i was gonna read you something one
[1:51:13] night
[1:51:15] amen but that's right amen he's gotta be
[1:51:17] into him in the holy ghost the token his
[1:51:20] own life in you that's the only thing
[1:51:22] that's accepted
[1:51:24] where we have our trouble and where we
[1:51:26] have our defeats folks
[1:51:28] is where the prophet says you know we
[1:51:29] get too many of our own ways
[1:51:32] mixed up in it
[1:51:35] i mean at least we still got to get rid
[1:51:36] of our own ways
[1:51:40] still too many of thomas boiler's ways
[1:51:44] in
[1:51:45] i don't know where i was at i was going
[1:51:46] to go to the rapture
[1:51:49] the challenge
[1:51:51] second thessalonians
[1:52:01] amen
[1:52:03] oh my when i when i got to thinking
[1:52:05] about this hallelujah
[1:52:07] my
[1:52:09] i had to be a fit
[1:52:12] off there's nothing
[1:52:14] nothing too hard for god nothing too
[1:52:16] hard for you
[1:52:17] sometimes we think it is
[1:52:21] but it's not even close or very hard for
[1:52:22] god
[1:52:24] folks for
[1:52:25] for one of for one of his children
[1:52:28] one time that needed something
[1:52:32] he so to speak stop the universe
[1:52:37] he
[1:52:38] told the sun to stop the moon to stop
[1:52:41] huh
[1:52:43] everything stopped
[1:52:45] why because one of his children had a
[1:52:47] need nothing is too hard for god if he
[1:52:50] can stop the sun and the moon for
[1:52:52] somebody's need he can sure take care of
[1:52:53] your knee
[1:53:00] second thessalonians 4
[1:53:03] we call this a
[1:53:06] funeral message but it's really a
[1:53:08] rapture message
[1:53:10] he just talks about those that are
[1:53:11] sleeping amen
[1:53:13] who are taking a nap but i would not
[1:53:15] have you ignorant
[1:53:16] brethren concerning them which are
[1:53:18] asleep
[1:53:19] and that ye sorrow not death even as
[1:53:21] others which have no hope
[1:53:25] amen
[1:53:30] i don't know if i should but i i feel
[1:53:32] like i maybe be all right sister becky i
[1:53:34] remember when
[1:53:35] we buried your mom
[1:53:37] if i remember right you was up there
[1:53:38] with a shovel singing and praising god
[1:53:40] anyone yeah
[1:53:42] i remember that i was there he said i
[1:53:43] think burying your mom with a devil
[1:53:45] praising god hallelujah
[1:53:48] huh
[1:53:49] she don't have to sorrow
[1:53:51] like others who have no
[1:53:52] hope why because we believe that if
[1:53:55] we're of god that we know where they're
[1:53:57] at
[1:54:00] no we ain't got to be sad like others
[1:54:02] who have no hope
[1:54:04] we can rejoice and oh my they're in a
[1:54:05] better place
[1:54:08] amen
[1:54:10] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:54:12] you saw not even as others which have no
[1:54:14] hope for if we believe that jesus died
[1:54:16] and rose again even so them also which
[1:54:18] sleep in jesus will god bring with him
[1:54:22] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:54:24] the lord that we which are alive and
[1:54:27] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[1:54:30] not prevent them which are asleep
[1:54:33] for the lord himself shall descend
[1:54:35] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:54:38] of the archangel and with the trump of
[1:54:40] god then the dead in christ shall rise
[1:54:44] first
[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:45] now we know that when jesus rose from
[1:54:47] the dead that abraham and sarah were
[1:54:50] seen down in the city right
[1:54:52] for about 30 days or so people begin the
[1:54:55] scene they wouldn't visit the old city
[1:54:56] and people saw them and so forth that's
[1:54:58] why the prophet of god said when this
[1:55:00] red direction takes place know that
[1:55:02] you're going to see loved ones
[1:55:04] perhaps you'll see your loved ones
[1:55:08] we're gonna have church then
[1:55:11] huh
[1:55:12] can you imagine brother irvin if you saw
[1:55:14] ivan
[1:55:17] huh you say i'm an uh oh where'd he go
[1:55:22] just see him for a glimpse
[1:55:24] see our loved ones
[1:55:26] all of a sudden
[1:55:30] and then what what happens after that
[1:55:36] then we which are alive and remain
[1:55:40] right
[1:55:41] shall be caught up
[1:55:44] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:55:47] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:55:50] be with the lord
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:53] folks if the prophet god said he really
[1:55:56] does not believe that he would die of
[1:55:57] old age before the lord comes back he'd
[1:56:00] be over 100 now
[1:56:02] thought that he would come in 1977 here
[1:56:04] we are in 2020
[1:56:07] how late is it
[1:56:09] we can almost assuredly say we believe
[1:56:11] i'll say it like he did i don't believe
[1:56:14] i'll die of old age before he comes
[1:56:17] huh
[1:56:19] praise be to god that means you'll
[1:56:21] either be in the rapture or a
[1:56:22] tribulation period
[1:56:24] i don't believe i'm gonna be in the
[1:56:24] tribulation period why because i have
[1:56:27] seen god
[1:56:29] in my life
[1:56:31] way too much
[1:56:33] remember he says the world sees me no
[1:56:35] more but you're going to see me
[1:56:37] how are you going to see me because i'll
[1:56:39] be with you even in you doing things
[1:56:41] that you know you could never do
[1:56:45] you know that it's me working in your
[1:56:47] life
[1:56:50] amen one of the things that really one
[1:56:52] of the things that tells you if you're
[1:56:53] his is you go through all kinds but yet
[1:56:56] there's something down inside him
[1:56:58] hanging on to you and helping you to
[1:57:00] serve him no matter what
[1:57:02] you love him anyway
[1:57:05] you still love him you're still serving
[1:57:06] him
[1:57:08] amen
[1:57:09] he brings you through all these thoughts
[1:57:11] you see him
[1:57:12] and i just happen to believe that one of
[1:57:14] these days folks how many believes you
[1:57:16] have to have faith i have to believe we
[1:57:18] have to challenge so to speak to know
[1:57:21] that god is more than able to one of
[1:57:24] these days i believe it says paul said
[1:57:26] will be changed
[1:57:29] in the moment
[1:57:31] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:57:35] well
[1:57:36] i'm not a psycho not a psychologist but
[1:57:38] a philosopher to know just what
[1:57:40] twinkling an eye is but
[1:57:42] my interpretation is something that
[1:57:44] happened pretty quick
[1:57:46] in a moment the twinkling of an eye just
[1:57:48] a little glimpse of something about your
[1:57:50] eye twinkles just a little light that
[1:57:52] shines like for a second it's gone
[1:57:54] just a twinkling of an eye just in a
[1:57:56] moment
[1:57:58] we'll feel a change sweep over
[1:58:01] huh
[1:58:04] it'll not be something that you can do
[1:58:06] hello
[1:58:07] but it'll be something god does in you
[1:58:11] i don't know about you but i believe
[1:58:12] that's a real faith challenge for a real
[1:58:14] believer to know that god's gonna change
[1:58:16] us in our very adams
[1:58:18] one time we're gonna be just like enoch
[1:58:21] the bible says and he was not
[1:58:24] for he had this testimony that he
[1:58:27] pleased god
[1:58:30] our testimony is that we please god
[1:58:33] and we have him
[1:58:36] on board we have him in our hearts
[1:58:40] letting him live out his life remember
[1:58:42] the token life the literal life reminds
[1:58:44] us nothing but the literal life of jesus
[1:58:46] christ living in you
[1:58:49] is the only thing that is accepted
[1:58:55] oh my aren't you thankful for that this
[1:58:57] is uh just worship the lord say thank
[1:58:59] you lord amen
[1:59:01] to know that he's on board no matter
[1:59:03] what comes no matter what goes he's on
[1:59:05] board because greater is he that is in
[1:59:07] you than he is that is in the world
[1:59:12] remember the laodicea church age let's
[1:59:14] talk about somebody else for just a
[1:59:16] minute
[1:59:19] over in revelations
[1:59:27] 11 revelations 3.
[1:59:31] we know in revelations 3
[1:59:34] the last church age
[1:59:36] unto the angel of the church of the
[1:59:38] laodiceans write
[1:59:40] these things saith the amen the faithful
[1:59:42] and true witness the beginning of the
[1:59:44] creation of god
[1:59:46] now notice
[1:59:47] behold
[1:59:48] i stand
[1:59:50] at the door
[1:59:52] was he with him
[1:59:54] no
[1:59:55] he was put outside wasn't he
[1:59:57] he wasn't with him anymore
[2:00:01] no
[2:00:02] he wasn't there anymore here's a church
[2:00:04] age
[2:00:05] that doesn't have him on the inside
[2:00:08] but has him on the outside
[2:00:10] what is their condition
[2:00:13] they say verse 17 thou sayest i am rich
[2:00:18] and increase with goods and have need of
[2:00:20] nothing
[2:00:21] and knoweth not
[2:00:23] that thou art wretched
[2:00:26] and miserable
[2:00:28] and poor
[2:00:29] and blind
[2:00:31] and naked
[2:00:34] that was their condition just as samson
[2:00:36] was a slave these people here in this
[2:00:39] church age because they didn't have him
[2:00:40] on the inside
[2:00:43] right they were wretched miserable poor
[2:00:45] blind and made naked and the bible says
[2:00:48] thou knowest not
[2:00:52] they didn't even have the mental
[2:00:54] capacity to know they were naked
[2:00:58] that they were miserable that they were
[2:01:01] poor they were blind they were wretched
[2:01:08] i'm here to tell you it'll be the group
[2:01:10] that comes up that says heaven
[2:01:12] we were rich in god we did we do all
[2:01:15] great kinds of unwonderful things
[2:01:17] huh they thought they were rich but they
[2:01:20] weren't
[2:01:21] he was actually outside they were doing
[2:01:23] their own thing
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:26] amen god's not coming for people who do
[2:01:28] their own thing
[2:01:30] he's coming for those who are fulfilling
[2:01:33] doing his service that he wants none not
[2:01:36] the thirst that he doesn't want done
[2:01:38] miserable poor blind and naked
[2:01:44] no doubt every one of us knows what it's
[2:01:45] like
[2:01:47] that when you grieve the holy
[2:01:48] spirit how many was like you grieve the
[2:01:51] holy spirit
[2:01:52] and he takes it slight from you
[2:01:56] how many has ever have ever experienced
[2:01:58] that
[2:02:00] hey folks am i your preacher your pastor
[2:02:03] is saying both hands are up sure
[2:02:05] i've lost my emperor did all kinds of
[2:02:07] stuff
[2:02:09] that doesn't take a whole lot folks
[2:02:12] just lose your temper one time
[2:02:14] just remember this
[2:02:16] the holy ghost gone
[2:02:18] ah that's right you're gonna have to say
[2:02:20] i'm sorry
[2:02:22] before he comes back
[2:02:25] all right we all what happens i pray i
[2:02:27] never do i sometimes i think you know
[2:02:29] i've gotten over i i i don't but get in
[2:02:31] sometimes
[2:02:33] uh
[2:02:34] dog will jump up pet me and poke me in
[2:02:37] the eye
[2:02:41] you know you just something's gonna
[2:02:43] irritate you right
[2:02:45] but anyway
[2:02:47] but just that empty feeling and then
[2:02:49] you're like i don't like this it's
[2:02:50] horrible how many knows it's horrible to
[2:02:52] live without christ
[2:02:54] horrible and live without the holy ghost
[2:02:58] if you're ever going to overcome
[2:03:00] anything listen we overcome this leia we
[2:03:02] come over lukewarm as everything because
[2:03:04] of him that's in you that's the only
[2:03:05] reason you overcome
[2:03:07] because greater is he that is in you
[2:03:09] than he that is in the world
[2:03:13] you can grieve the holy spirit away how
[2:03:14] many believes that
[2:03:16] turn with me
[2:03:17] one more scripture i want to go to in
[2:03:19] john the 15th chapter
[2:03:28] i am the true vine and my father is the
[2:03:31] husbandman
[2:03:32] every branch in me that beareth not
[2:03:35] fruit he taketh away
[2:03:37] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[2:03:40] purges it that it may bring forth more
[2:03:42] fruit
[2:03:43] that's why i always preach
[2:03:47] that god is never satisfied with you
[2:03:50] no matter how good you are
[2:03:52] he's in the project and the job of
[2:03:54] making you a little better yet
[2:03:56] how many believes that he's always
[2:03:58] working on us
[2:04:00] he's always pruning
[2:04:02] always trying to get us to bear more
[2:04:04] fruit
[2:04:05] amen
[2:04:07] now notice now are clean through the
[2:04:09] words which i have spoken unto you abide
[2:04:12] in me and i in you
[2:04:15] amen
[2:04:16] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[2:04:19] itself
[2:04:22] except it abides
[2:04:24] in the vine
[2:04:26] our brother said the other day he says
[2:04:28] now you are the vine and i am the
[2:04:29] branches
[2:04:31] he said i was he was listening if they
[2:04:33] were really listening he says that's not
[2:04:35] how it is jesus is the main mind right
[2:04:39] we are the branches the vine don't bear
[2:04:43] any fruit the fruit comes off of the
[2:04:45] branches
[2:04:46] amen and that's what you and i are we
[2:04:48] are the branches that bears god's life
[2:04:52] no more can ye accept about you abide in
[2:04:55] me amen
[2:04:56] i am the vine and ye are the branches
[2:05:00] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[2:05:03] same bringeth forth much fruit
[2:05:06] how many please that
[2:05:08] what kind of fruit the fruit of the
[2:05:10] spirit
[2:05:11] brother how can you be so long suffering
[2:05:14] because greater is he that is in me that
[2:05:16] is in you that is in the world
[2:05:18] how can you love people that smite you
[2:05:21] on the cheek and do you wrong how can
[2:05:22] you never
[2:05:24] go telling everybody how much you hate
[2:05:25] them people

[2:07:20] good no zero
[2:07:22] it's going the other way they're doing
[2:07:24] absolutely nothing the only body that
[2:07:26] can do anything is
[2:07:28] a christian that has christ in their
[2:07:30] life
[2:07:32] they're the only ones that can do
[2:07:34] anything
[2:07:35] for god and for good
[2:07:39] without him
[2:07:40] you're empty your void
[2:07:43] if a man abide not in me

[2:14:35] that he's with us
[2:14:37] aren't you glad that the holy spirit is
[2:14:38] still here
[2:14:40] because one of these days that holy
[2:14:41] spirit will be lifted
[2:14:43] and then everything in here will be
[2:14:45] completely black
[2:14:47] brother brahm says he seen this age what
[2:14:49] did it do completely
[2:14:51] black out
[2:14:53] after the rapture for the gentiles
[2:14:55] it is going to be completely dark
[2:14:58] no hope no joy
[2:15:01] no peace no any of that i mean let's bow
[2:15:04] our heads
[2:15:06] search your heart
[2:15:09] ask yourself if you truly
[2:15:11] are so surrendered to him that
[2:15:14] everything that comes your way
[2:15:16] you're overcoming he's overcoming
[2:15:18] through you
[2:15:22] i know we have our faults i know we have
[2:15:24] our failures i know we have the times
[2:15:26] that we get defeated and when we do we
[2:15:28] get right back up again and try again
[2:15:30] don't we
[2:15:31] that's right because we know that hey
[2:15:33] there's still just too much of me in
[2:15:35] there and i'm committing myself in a
[2:15:37] greater way i realize there's still too
[2:15:38] much of me
[2:15:40] and not enough of him how many wants
[2:15:42] more of him say lord jesus i'm raising
[2:15:45] my hand
[2:15:46] i want more
[2:15:48] of you
[2:15:49] more and more and more lord until i can
[2:15:53] say that it is not me
[2:15:55] there's nothing good about me i can't do
[2:15:57] a thing
[2:15:59] but he can do anything
[2:16:01] lord jesus we ask this morning as we
[2:16:03] raise our hands to you we ask god that
[2:16:05] you would help us lord to go farther to
[2:16:09] a death to ourselves in a greater way so
[2:16:11] that you can live so that you can have
[2:16:13] the preeminence
[2:16:14] in our life lord
[2:16:16] and so that we can realize that no
[2:16:18] matter how great many of different
[2:16:22] people experience different trials
[2:16:24] different tests different things that we
[2:16:26] have to overcome but lord man we all
[2:16:28] realize that if we have you on board and
[2:16:30] if you are the one that's in us
[2:16:32] there is nothing too great for you there
[2:16:34] is nothing that you can't do lord
[2:16:37] we ask god that you would be the leader
[2:16:38] in the guide in our lives lord in a
[2:16:41] greater way after this morning

[2:17:12] body lord jesus we're going to see our
[2:17:14] loved ones we believe it with all of our
[2:17:16] god because you have not brought us this
[2:17:19] far
[2:17:20] to leave us
[2:17:21] we believe god that you're doing a work
[2:17:23] in our lives and we thank you for it
[2:17:25] we ask your continued leadership and
[2:17:27] guidance forgive us lord jesus this
[2:17:29] morning where there's still too much of
[2:17:31] us

[2:17:36] and that's when we fail it's when we're
[2:17:38] too great yet
[2:17:39] lord we want you to be the great one
[2:17:40] lord we want you to be greater than what
