[15:38] amen
[15:40] [Music]
[15:52] foreign
[16:07] i will begin from 22. it says that
[16:09] ye worship you know
[16:12] not what you know not
[16:16] you worship ye no
[16:18] not what
[16:20] we know what we worship
[16:22] for salvation is of the jews
[16:25] but the hour cometh and now is
[16:28] when the true worshipers shall worship
[16:31] the father in spirit and in truth
[16:34] for the father secret such as
[16:38] to worship him
[16:42] god is spirit and they that worship him
[16:45] must worship him in spirit and in truth
[16:50] [Music]
[16:55] [Music]
[17:27] [Music]
[17:31] then while still standing you read with
[17:33] me
[17:33] 95.
[18:39] that you come and use this modern lips
[18:49] of faith tonight
[18:52] open the eyes of our understanding
[19:21] true worshipers
[19:25] amen
[19:27] praise the lord
[19:29] where we read
[19:31] in the book of john chapter 4
[19:34] [Music]
[19:36] if you read the whole of that chapter
[19:40] it is jesus conversation with the other
[19:42] woman
[19:47] praise the lord i mean and i know all of
[19:49] us are acquainted with that verse for
[19:51] the scriptures
[19:54] but my
[19:55] major point where my
[19:57] point of interest is uh on this 23 22 23
[20:01] and 24
[20:19] and in truth
[20:24] and this means if there is a true
[20:26] worshiper
[20:31] there is also a false worshiper what one
[20:36] you may think that you're worshiping god
[20:38] these are all the sins that control that
[20:40] in truth
[20:41] when you are a false worshiper
[20:44] but jesus said yes we are that the time
[20:47] is coming
[20:50] when the true worshipers have arrested
[20:52] them
[20:53] they will worship god women have seen
[20:55] the catholics in the spirit
[20:58] and in truth
[21:00] praise be to god come here
[21:03] amen i mean some here talk about true
[21:06] worshippers
[21:10] beyond just singing
[21:28] but that
[21:42] let us read psalms 91.
[21:49] 95. sorry
[21:59] [Music]
[22:24] saying come and let us
[22:29] when we come in the presence of god to
[22:31] worship god between them
[22:34] all of us
[22:36] we must involve ourselves in worship
[22:39] today
[22:41] praise be to god i mean because david
[22:44] says come and let us worship let us sing
[22:48] to him
[22:50] praise be to god
[22:52] come and let us sing unto the lord
[22:54] reject
[22:56] let us make a joyful noise
[22:59] to necessary
[23:02] to invent double
[23:04] man amen yes let us
[23:07] let us make a joyful noise to the rock
[23:09] of our salvation
[23:11] [Music]
[23:14] so worship moves with the noise
[23:20] praise be to god i mean there are people
[23:22] who claim that they worship in spirit
[23:26] that i'm singing in my heart
[23:29] praise be to god
[23:31] amen
[23:49] take advantage with all our strengths
[23:52] with all our hearts
[23:56] with all that is within us
[23:59] to be our true worshipper
[24:01] ourselves
[24:14] what is the truth amazing
[24:39] [Applause]
[24:41] amen
[24:43] so we are the true worshippers that did
[24:45] not fail our sins
[24:47] and the bible tells us
[24:49] we must worship god in spirit study not
[24:52] since the catholic more young and in
[24:53] truth
[24:54] there is something about to worship what
[24:57] the way jesus is
[25:23] [Applause]
[25:41] his presence with thanksgiving
[25:45] make a joyful noise unto him with psalms
[25:48] i mean then three rocks
[25:53] for god is a great god
[25:57] a singer
[25:59] amen
[26:00] for our god is a great god
[26:03] our faith
[26:04] have you come with a joyful noise
[26:06] subject
[26:07] yes then you start
[26:16] and if you know how big and great and
[26:19] powerful god is
[26:32] [Applause]
[26:38] [Applause]
[26:48] that is how i worship my god
[26:50] since there's
[27:30] [Music]
[27:42] brothers and sisters
[27:43] when someone is touching
[27:46] this
[27:49] amen
[27:52] but when we come to worship god never
[27:54] treat just sins
[27:56] we must yield our soul truly know where
[27:58] are you we let go everything
[28:23] [Music]
[28:28] and we know that jesus is telling us
[28:32] true worship comes from the heart
[28:36] amen amen
[28:39] a real real change in worship oh
[28:42] my god
[28:51] [Music]
[28:56] be to god
[28:58] many times we don't get breakthrough in
[29:00] worship instead of singing at the top of
[29:01] the line of sins because we don't know
[29:04] how to worship
[29:07] but worship does not begin from the
[29:08] church
[29:16] [Applause]
[29:26] [Applause]
[29:33] praise the lord amen amen
[29:36] and now the time has come it didn't say
[29:38] that
[30:16] amen are you saying that god you are
[30:18] worshipping
[30:20] that that is
[30:28] [Applause]
[30:34] and
[30:39] [Applause]
[30:43] amen
[30:44] you are recognizing the greatness of god
[30:48] or somewhere
[30:56] amen because of what he has done for you
[30:59] already
[31:00] praise be to god
[31:31] jesus when you've got the revelation of
[31:33] worship
[31:35] those things happen automatically
[31:39] praise be to god
[31:41] amen nina
[31:43] i worship all to be with the figure oh
[31:46] because i couldn't
[31:48] yes sir
[31:50] you must do it with figures
[31:54] because god is a living god
[31:57] and where the spirit of god there is
[31:59] liberty
[32:01] in the world
[32:02] amen nina so when we are worshiping god
[32:07] we have to worship god when we are free
[32:09] catholicism
[32:11] where is the lord
[32:34] is
[32:55] left soul
[32:57] and evil spirit took cover
[33:01] amen amen
[33:06] to come and pray instruments
[33:23] amen amen
[33:25] we don't give god only half of worship
[33:28] cattle not the two machines that are
[33:30] cooking to do
[33:31] amen
[33:33] praise be to god come here
[33:37] if god can just help us sing
[33:39] that triangle
[33:41] the other day i was talking i was
[33:43] conversing with one brother
[33:45] i didn't know organic when you're not
[33:46] anywhere talking about worship
[33:48] since the
[33:50] catholic and you realize that in the
[33:53] message
[33:58] somehow
[34:01] worship is a little is lacking
[34:14] and we ought to be the best worshippers
[34:19] [Applause]
[34:29] and we know what we stand for
[34:39] [Applause]
[34:46] i remember
[34:51] [Music]
[35:01] like people who are saved
[35:04] they used to plant them names
[35:06] father two man
[35:08] just because of the way they worship
[35:12] praise be to god i mean
[35:24] [Applause]
[35:29] and god amen man but i'm not worshiping

[36:14] testify a word and i
[36:16] know of judaism that when we are

[38:46] every morning and his sermon is in
[38:48] spirit
[38:49] and no more doing anymore
[38:52] that's why he happened to see what he
