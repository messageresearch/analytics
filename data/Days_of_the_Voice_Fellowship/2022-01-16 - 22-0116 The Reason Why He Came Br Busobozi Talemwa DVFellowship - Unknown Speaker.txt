than 50 young people so those who will remain during the school time you have to say happy to see you after quite a long time and by the way our interpreter is not here and so this brother is helping out can you get us brother i i have not heard from him personally but i understand brother wanga and his wife is it the whole family or only with his wife with the children part of the family here yeah okay so uh him and his wife um i understand they traveled somewhere but rather than which are away do not have that united you get organa states okay oh yours that was yeah she hasn't gone a bit we are reading revelation 12. verses 7. to 13 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels okay i'll read it again yeah that's better brother marvin god bless you and there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against fault and his angels i think we can read verse by verse and prevailed not neither was there was there a place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and saturn which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him [Music] saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accused of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and nights [Music] and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and we overcame him hallelujah amen by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony and they loved not their lives and we loved not our lives even unto death never [Applause] rejoice rejoice you heavens and ye that dwell in them word to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea and for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because you know it that he has for a short time since and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man said okay we'll not get into that part praise the lord let us uh speak to the lord a bit not to get any more come on father once again we come before you and one commander perform the same father we were coming you in this place this morning which version in chinese precious name of jesus christ amen amen have your seats i'd like to speak a little bit about jesus yes really whenever we meet we talk about jesus we were to sink and talk and and uh i am going to uh kindly request for your undivided attention uh your mind also let it not go around just be in one place like a touring which for chimo and let us be in one accord one spirit and those who are outside the only way i can be able to know you are following is by shouting aloud amen praise the lord amen and so i'm going to speak about jesus and my subject is the reason why he came in so this morning we shall go over it and know that many of you that are now here we are not here then so i'm hoping that praise the lord amen the reason why he came in why did jesus come yes why did he die on the cross why why why did he come and so i will begin with a quote from the message go away jesus go go wake jesus says and god the creator of the heavens and the earth the catholic transcendence god the creator of the winds and the waves not they have to obey his word [Music] you see as much as the world is god in the beginning was just was he wasn't even god how many knew that in the beginning rather before the beginning was it even [Applause] that god desired he already was worshipped before we were created the prophet of god god away that he began now to express his nerves [Applause] and so when he wanted to be god that was what did he do he created angels yeah you see when you read the bible you will not find find a bat oh um you will not find a creation account of angels praise the name of the lord amen for him to create angels he only needed worship that they are in heaven watching him everything they have seen a [Applause] where god dwells the throne room so they they they imagine angels they have to cover their feet and themselves because of the holy [Music] [Applause] that is [Applause] oh and do not worship something else worship god don't sing the children shall not sins are catholic worship or worship is a big subject worship is a big subject ah sorry the biggest scenes and now i want to bring it down after he has created angels we come in the creation account after he asks angels to worship him now you can go to genesis 1-1 what does genesis 1-1 say read together one two three go see that great he has now become god what you said when he was not gone but yeah by the time we are opening our bible but we are not talking about the bible that we are already created and there were no good and bad angels you see the god i'm talking about does not need something [Applause] [Applause] you see you created the greater light to rule the day [Music] [Applause] [Applause] but there was no one creature which was an express image of himself make man let go no moon too praise the name of the lord amen with me to genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image directly and now verse 27 says so [Applause] yes object of worship that's all that you take is the identity since you were so god created man now so he was already being worshiped yeah you read that since he was then he is creating man what do you think was the purpose why he was creating that man told you why watch it can somebody tell me what was what yes my sister you needed fellowship that is to manifest but you know you have the right to manifest these attributes through all these other things because those who are part of his attributes but yes also this was a manifestation of his attributes there was an absolute reason why he went on but there was nothing created in his image [Music] other time i i preached to you about something that man has that no other creature has queen above one thing that separates us from all the creatures [Applause] separates now praise the name of the lord amen and by the time we finish up i know you were right normally somebody would you take a date and so we noticed that man that god created was in the image of god he [Music] no no those are not the right words conquer to subdue to conquer can somebody please if you have a record throw it out quickly yeah yes yes yes dominion over allah you realize [Music] but where to be because there is only one form of eternal life what we always wear wait wait wait and the reason we were in some direction early amen if i exist now whenever i would want to if i if how many believe they have eternal life you have it now like no no no are you not going to come i believe they have it now you know what to get in [Music] why because the world is weakening where how many believe that amen praise the name of the lord amen and so we know this here why not that man has always been a part of god and god is the only thing that is a tunnel i want you to see i want to paint this picture for you a little more yeah god creates everything it's just like a man who is planning on getting married you know he gets everything again [Music] that beautiful house without a wife is a house uh i told the church this brother came to my home so when after the service he came to me i would like to correct you i did not come to your home come to your house but he was alone he had not expressed an image out of him yesterday [Applause] [Music] many people yet we [Music] hallelujah amen and they would all bring them and learn them until she was tired and i [Music] [Applause] i'm sorry brother you do not tell me that you're going to give this testament let me talk about it because this is in the line of this he brother marvin told me brother young amber as i was speaking i had not had a good smartphone for a long time he had a smartphone but he lost it and so he has not had one for a long time so when i spoke about a little bit of the authority that we have when are you getting injured between us to speak what's up existence brother chadwick it happened it happened into existence hallelujah amen it happened [Music] we are flesh of his flesh fenega tone that's a word we and god there is no difference can you imagine that it should stabilize him well i'm not just telling you lies i'm just giving you the words applied so therefore we are a part of him know where to live god created everything catholic excuse me then he created the man to watch over everything you know that's why it was not good for him to dwell alone [Applause] i'm not talking about elohim amen foreign i don't know i don't know the language but but but self oh self existent one he was alone allow me to use that word he was by himself from the beginning there's no cause [Music] he manifested his attribute like brother dr peter said he manifested his attributes a part of him let me tell you whenever i think about that but when there was a concentration i just feel like crying in my heart you could be born in any family that you were born among any people you were [Music] and that part of god manifests they don't manifest themselves but they manifest the character of god hallelujah amen you know i met one person one day and he said where do people preach like that because you have nothing in this life he is one of the richest in africa africa in his country but you find his brother will go on the streets of the lord [Music] praise the lord amen okay let's carry on a little bit more here he says um genesis 2 18 brother give it give me the verse says and the lord god says it's not good that man should be alone there was a part of him that needed to be manifested man had to be the same one the mighty grenade we the lord god are taken from man this hallelujah amen that's why when you read the bible yesterday the bible types foreign hear that she can't get you it should not make you look down look church i don't believe that we come to church look down on the field down if you have chains that are binding amen if you go with them they'll kill you the bible says where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom is amen and this man homosexual you know always say this you know who said that it was not good for man to be alone i need [Applause] because god is so powerful i took it and when it came to surgery in the physical marriage god needs to is my younger sisters my sister god bless you look at my calling oh yeah okay don't do that why don't you college this man is still on saturday night some maybe they were not they were still you know buddy exactly that's the right word i think it's called is it chloroform all right he was throwing their then being that he's still under that influence may become a beast to you faster you know i don't know what i'm going oh and then we find that when god had already uh you know finished operating on adam adam here is something i wanted to [Music] but not the one to choose for you but in the video they wait for dreams why didn't they be wrong because i saw this sister i always say this but you don't know if you are going to marry her because of a dream she must also see a dream i'll take it that's how god what all those things are good everything to die for him stable praying and waiting yesterday oh so sisters in the message do not propose that so we don't want a bunch of sisters proposing to younger brothers jersey the man or the young man approached the system before she was even sure before he was sure [Music] [Music] foreign is hey oh but there was a deep calling hallelujah there is something that is a mystery about marriage [Music] is foreign adam he woke up from prayer yes this young man here um and i think he was also in prayer and he woke up and he found a young lady now all of you are wondering what has happened part of my summer money hungry praise the name of the lord amen i thought it's always good to type the spirit on the physics of you're born on my bones amen the name of the lord [Laughter] you're born on my boss hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord that's a wonderful thing to tell you and the young lady did not run away she just followed him engagement [Applause] and so this young man is from ethiopia all the way from ethiopia he came all because of her yeah the name of jesus [Music] this is a wonderful thing because it types the spirit in the church blessed be your holy name commit them into your hands cover them with your blood that you will sustain them lord hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord but the airframe will be in brother robert's church on sunday for them to announce the engagement there brother brother robert where these preparations will be announced how do they call it do they call it aeronautical engineering or what is that called aircraft maintenance and engineering yes so she repairs airplanes so if you happen to fly on on uganda airlines you know if these people mess up the plane if it is flying in the air you can easily crash amen amen marriage is a sweet wonderful thing isn't it amen and so this is exactly how it was so wasted with charlie give me 30 more minutes that you can start to succeed want to find out the reason why jesus came [Applause] hallelujah amen so before we talk about why he came i want us to look to look at the verse we looked at it in revelation 12. verse 7 quickly now because i'm saving my time i'm trying to keep up the time of request okay so we get to the next part of this it says and there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragonfold and his angels never [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] manifests himself in many ways yeah there'll be someone getting ancient so we say that michael jordan and so we see that when lucifer electron lucifer the one is calling the timothy was an english was you are the interpreter so you have to find the word my precious brother he said michael was unleashed michael michael indeed he is [Applause] amen and the bible says he prevailed not by willing neither was their place found anymore michael came back with a sweep step back because you have glorified he oh [Music] you see whether his son has [Applause] came down almost thought and it goes through once lucifer came down verse 17 of chapter 2 genesis but of the tree of the do you have the verse brother chapter 2 verse 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it talk with the anger for in the day that thou eatest reflects his character and his ambition how he wants [Music] check out your family what kind of man he is you may say super spiritual hallelujah oh hallelujah we know you by what you married amen we know brother dr peter here [Music] what is the womb in uganda under the one navana amen amen and we than they were when the woman saw that the tree six chapter three and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took off the fruit they off and did it and gave old son to the husband with her and he did it and the bible says we need you to be okay that you you you can dress in a way it doesn't matter you see they have arrest for modernity she gave also her husband with her and he did it the way it buy it for is do you all have your bibles somewhere quickly now it's not in my house but quickly but i want to show you something this is just so amazing first timothy are you there let me say what you saw chapter 2 and i wanted to read verses um verses 12. uh okay are you all there whenever we read together one two three go they started to get mobility but i suffer huh no one is there okay let us begin afresh one two three go but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to accept authority over the man but to be in silence that's why even in a home the man is the head of the home yes even in the church a woman is not allowed to be an old people wow and he became me so that i become him jesus yes you can see you forget so that [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] the sacrifice that healed me [Music] [Applause] [Music] you died my life [Applause] oh [Music] here where are you oh you know it's a very touching thing so uh we may attain what you lost for us just like a man a young man like a friend could leave ethiopia left his parents now they tell us that they left everybody for a woman that's exactly why what jesus did yes [Music] he went through against all odds for you for me and people ask me if he felt that way what did adam do for god lays the blame on adam sorry does [Applause] now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is unadulterated and it's no longer married and their husband is not to take her back that word adam took her back [Music] because eve committed adultery but he adam took up what happened [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] no matter what [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Laughter] jesus will never leave you alone [Music] he will never leave me alone he's with me [Music] [Music] why have you still loved me [Music] few more moments here listen he says brother give it to me again when it is a child [Music] he says he says if a woman now she was a part of him and said yeah and then he says you will not let your question if conceived by him even not from a reputable adam he knew she could yamanya are sober he knew exactly what would happen to the human race praise the name of the lord amen eve was guilty even the door adam had all reason to put her away that way he could save himself and start over again yeah he could not help it but come seek her out he had to find a defender to get hannah the coast yeah [Applause] [Music] you're not ready it's all for the bride you're not going whatever jesus did also yes it was all for you yeah because i died for you yeah for you no man can stand in the way hallelujah amen the bible says in the book of genesis 3 8 bible and they had a voice now we need that divorce the voice of the lord catholic okay because may have come down is yes sir because god is determined is hallelujah
