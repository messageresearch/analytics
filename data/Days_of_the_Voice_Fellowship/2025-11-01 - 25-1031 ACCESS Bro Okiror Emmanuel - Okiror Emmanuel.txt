It is you inclusive. Praise the Lord. Shadows are not gathering. This night is coming and if you delay, it will come for you and for me. Praise the Lord. But there's a wonderful love that he has promised and that promise is for me and for you my brother sister. Praise the Lord. Let us read in the book of Luke 5:E1 17 as we are going to share the word of God as briefest it will be or as long as it will be whatever the spirit will lead. Praise the Lord. uh Luke chapter uh 5 and verse 17-2. Praise the Lord. Uh Luke chapter 17 and verse uh chapter 5:E1 17 up to 25. And the Bible says, I don't know whether we're all there. We can say amen. Uh Bible says, "And it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of the every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them. And behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with epileps. And they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him. And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in before because of the multitude, they went up on the housetop and let him down through the uh tiling with his coach into the midst before Jesus. And when they he saw their faith, he said unto them unto them, "Man, thy sins are forgiven thee." And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this which speakest blasphemies?" Who can forgive sins but God alone? Verse 22. But when Jesus perceived their salt, he answering said unto them, the reason here in what here, what reason here in your hearts, whether it is easier to say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, rise up and walk. But that may know that the Son of Man has power upon the earth to forgive sins, he said unto the sick of the epileps, I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy coach, and go into thy house. And immediately he rose up be before them, and took up that that where on he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. Let us pray. Dear Lord Jesus, once I say I thank you for this scripture, we really want to commit this night and to thee Lord and the sharing of thy word. I commit even myself who standing before your children Lord for I do not have anything to speak before them but be thee Lord Jesus you come unto me that father whatsoever I speak let it be out of thy word let it be for the edification that father your children may grow spiritually strong Lord Jesus let them have a breakthrough through this night oh father I pray Lord Jesus Christ let it minister this word unto their souls oh Lord that father they may find peace of mind that they may find a healing of their soul. That they may have a breakthrough over every trouble that they are going through in this life. Oh father, I pray let the holy spirit come down therefore to minister unto us Lord Jesus that father we may hear from thee. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. We may be seated. I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we are certainly thankful to the Lord for such a wonderful time he has given unto us and to come tonight to share and to pray. Just wait on him. Expect him to do something for us. Praise the Lord. And whenever you come to church, you should expect something to happen to you. Praise the Lord. That should be a mindset, a mindset and an attitude of every Christian that as long as I go into the house of the Lord, I must come back a changey person. Why? Because in the house of the Lord, there is a word that brings out a healing of the soul. Amid is all troubles. Because for as long as you pray that person, there must be a way God will speak unto you. God will lead a preacher to speak that which will bring a peaceful heart unto you. Praise the Lord. That which will present unto you all the promises that God has given unto us. Now we are read from the book of u Luke 5:17. Jesus is trying to describe uh I mean the Bible here is trying to describe of what happened in the city of Galilee. Praise the Lord. And today we are going to share the the text that or the heading that we are going to share is access. Praise the Lord. Or accessibility, access towards something. When you need something, you must access it by all means. Praise the Lord. But now the means that you access it will matter a lot. By what means do you access it? Praise the Lord. Let me first try to read something here. Uh just a little let me get it. To access is just like permission or liberty or ability to enter. Praise the Lord. Approach or to pass an uh to and from a place or to approach or communicate with a personal thing. Praise the Lord. It can also mean freedom or ability to obtain or make use of something. Praise the Lord. If something is present and there's a freedom and there's ability for you to do it, you ought to access and use it. Praise the Lord. And a way or means of entering or approaching a certain or cannot uh provide access to Praise the Lord. There's something here. It's the means of entering or approaching. Praise the Lord. That could also be the same or the act or the an instant of accessing something that you get into something that you desire to have. Praise the Lord. Now here the Bible talks about uh uh the the the man who came across uh Jesus Christ present in the in the place where he was preaching but there was a multitude of people who were gathered together with various reasons. Now it matters a lot the reason why you go to church. Praise the Lord. We can tell a story of uh John the Baptist as he was in the wilderness. John the Baptist was in the wilderness preaching the gospel of all good news to people and he was preparing the way of the Lord before he came into place. Praise the Lord. But many people came into that place for various reasons. Why? Because perhaps some had rumors that there was a man who was just putting on skin animal skin. There was a man who was just eating or just enjoying milk and honey. He was just taking only honey as his food. Praise the Lord. And he was preaching about a certain man, a gospel which we could not understand. Praise the Lord. And everyone desired that let me first go and see what this man was really doing. Praise the Lord. Now it matters a lot which reason why you came to church. Because the Bible presents us here the different categories of people who were present that day when the Lord Jesus Christ was preaching the gospel. Praise the Lord. He was performing miracles. And because the Bible tells us that he was there, there was a power of God to heal them. Praise the Lord. Now the Pharisees and the doctors were present. Those doctors of law, all of them came from different towns of Galilee. And the Bible says that Jesus was there preaching from city to city by that time. Praise the Lord. But because these people here had the desire to understand who Jesus was, they had a desire also after trying to understand him, how best could they condemn him through his words. Praise the Lord. So they did all their best. Wherever Jesus went, they were also present. Praise the Lord. Because the Bible tells us that these people were coming from different cities. Some were from Jerusalem, some were from Judea, some were from other parts of the other cities. Praise the Lord. They were all gathered for one common purpose. Praise the Lord. And they all come to Jesus simply to condemn whatsoever he was doing. And during that time, these Pharisees and doctors were from all those cities that we have counted. Some from Galilee, Jerusalem, and from Judea. And and there was a power of God that was there present to heal them. Praise the Lord. But there were people there were men who had been perhaps at home. They were trying to see a way of helping their own friend or their relative but they had no means of doing it. Praise the Lord. Perhaps they tried different hospitals. They tried different means of helping him. But this time around they had the one who could do it. Praise the Lord. But because of maybe the distance or the time the how or because one was sick they were just carrying him. They delayed a bit a little bit to reach earlier. Praise the Lord. And the Bible says that when they arrived, they reach and got that people were already packed. The crusade was already full. The building where the people Jesus was preaching from was already full and packed with people. So these people never had access on how to get into the place. Praise the Lord. Yet they in them they had a desire that they could enter in and take their beloved one to be healed by Jesus Christ. But there were people who were packed inside. You need to be very very careful brother sister. How you came to church, your motive and your purpose why you have come to church. Because these Pharisees who came earlier, they made sure that they on time. They were already packed inside. Instead of allowing people who had a desire to get something which was right for them, they had their own motive. Yet even the other people had a desire that their person will be healed. Praise the Lord. And these people could not have access because the crowd was too big. Praise the Lord. There was nowhere that they could pass. And because people were packed, people were very many and maybe many also had brought their their beloved ones who were sick. Perhaps some they had come by themselves. They desired that they could come and get healed by the Lord Jesus Christ. They came all together all long distances just to gather in that place until the place was full. Praise the Lord. Now these people they had occupied the seats and they needed I mean they had occupied the seats and those needed help had to take another access praise the lord they had to find a solution what best can we do in order to reach our person to the lord JESUS CHRIST THEY SOUGHT all possible means maybe THEY CALL ASHAS PLEASE COME OVER HERE THERE'S an emergency can we have a west and we go to the lord Jesus Christ they say no it is not possible praise the lord [snorts] &gt;&gt; they could tried whosoever was available. Maybe the people were in charge of the church of the place or whosoever was possibly available at that time but they couldn't have access to enter through. Praise the Lord. Because everyone had his own idea why he was inside. The place was packed. Jesus Christ was preaching. Praise the Lord. Now these people had to deise another mechanism, another way that how can we reach our person to the Lord Jesus Christ. That was all what they desired in their hearts. They desire to have access. They desire to have a way through. They desire to have a breakthrough. They desire that how can we reach towards him. That was all what mattered to them. There was nothing which could matter to them. Praise the Lord. Now they could wonder that maybe because they are doctors of law. They are Pharisees. Maybe they will start condemning us. They will start telling us this and that. We have done things which are bad. Because these Pharisees after these people are found the access. Praise the Lord. After they had come in, praise the Lord. After the Bible says that they went to the rooftop up there, they went and opened the place where they could manage to lower down. They are person who had epilepsy. Praise the Lord. The man was sick. Praise the Lord. This man was was not able to walk. He was just lying on bed all the time. He couldn't do anything on his own. And he needed someone to help him. Praise the Lord. He couldn't have it in by his faith. He needed someone who could push him ahead. Praise the Lord. He needed someone who could do something who could take him ahead. Maybe perhaps he had a story. He had a testimonies of the Lord Jesus Christ healing all like kind of like manner of diseases. Praise the Lord. But he never had ability to go there. For a woman who was amid the crowd for what she tried to force her own access through because she had ability to praise the Lord. But this man was having epilepsy. He was just sick lying on bed. He couldn't do it. Praise the Lord. There was no access. The other woman who touched the Lord's garment had an access. Praise the Lord. She pushed through the crowd. She had the strength. She had energy to do it. Praise the Lord. And even we can see even the blind calling the Lord Jesus Christ as he was passing by. He needed that his son of David have mercy on me. Praise the Lord. He had ability at least to speak a voice. Praise the Lord. But now this man never had access. Even when people brought him in. Praise the Lord. Even when he was brought in by other people, there was no way to go through. Praise the Lord. And now these people had to deise a mechanism. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; For many years, Satan's through religious leaders have tried to hinder the move of the gospel of Christ. Praise the Lord. Because the Bible says that they are of the devil as they are father of the devil. Maybe we can read that from a book of John chapter uh 8:44 to 48. Can read it faster. Praise the Lord. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We need to be live. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't me to do because the spirit of sleep will take you up. Uh chapter 8 verse 44. The Bible says that yeah of your father the devil and the last of your father yeah will do. He was a murderer from the beginning and bought not in the truth. Remember that he doesn't desire the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie he speakest of the his own for he is a liar and a father of it. Praise the Lord. For he is a liar and a father of it. And because I tell you the truth here, believe me not, which of uh which of you com convince com convince me of any sin? And if I say and if I say the truth, why do not believe me? He that is of God heareth God's words. Here therefore hear them not because they are of they are not of God. Praise the Lord. Then answered the Jews and said unto him, say we not well that though at a samar town and he has a devil. Praise the Lord. That was a motive. That's why these Pharisees and the doctors of law were in in this place. Praise the Lord. For them they were gathered into the place not to hear the truth. But they have their own agenda. Praise the Lord. Because they were of their father the devil. the the they are father the devil is a liar. So they had to gather themselves perhaps had a meeting before they could go in perhaps they had to plan they had to do all whatever it takes to see that how could they trap Jesus to find a way how to put him down. Praise the Lord. So after they had entered in they were not after the truth they after condemning him. They after they were just waiting for a moment when something could happen that they could start murmuring. Praise the Lord. Many times even they could not even speak loud. They would just murmur within themselves. Praise the Lord. Something has happened. The man has been lowered down. He has got an access down. He has been healed. Jesus has told him to pack his bed and go home. And now they are wondering instead of perhaps wondering why they were able to break the rooftop for them. They were wondering why would he heal such a man? Praise the Lord. Why would he forgive his sin? Is he not blaspheming? Is he God to forgive sin? Praise the Lord. They were all trying to manipulate things. Praise the Lord. In order to hinder the move of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, there was a time when I was before I got saved. When we are still told there that we need to be very careful on on the religions which have come into existence, praise the Lord. We were told that please don't accept to be to be taken by those people who are called. Uh they will deceive you. They will take you into their things and and rob your money. they will do this and that to you. Praise the Lord. They were so careful to advise us not to move out of Catholic. Praise the Lord. They desire that they we could continue that we continue living in that very place year after year never to have access to come out. Praise the Lord. But because of the mercies of the Lord, he brought all of us out. Praise the Lord. Because this very people the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the doctors of the laws. These people always have desired to hinder the move of God. Even they were able to tell those of Peter go out there after weeping them never to preach in that name. They were trying to hinder every move of God. And today my brother my sister they still hindering the move of God in by their own means that they are trying. But I want to tell you they won't make it because God has ability to do whatever it takes. Praise the Lord. Now that was a man in the book of uh Luke that we have had uh that we have seen who had no ability to access the place of of relief. Praise the Lord. A place where he was going to get healed. And the people of the Pharisees also came around but not with a motive of getting healed. Remember the Bible tells us that there was power of God which was present that day to heal everyone. Praise the Lord. Everyone who was in the house whether he had a spirit of lies, whether he had a spirit of of fornication, adultery, whatever it may be, the power of God was present to heal all of them. But because they their motive wasn't right enough, they could not get healed. Praise the Lord. Now the people who never had access tried all their means and they were able to access the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us read in the book of uh John chapter 5 verse one. Uh book of John chapter 5. Can move backwards a little. Uh John chapter 1 verse one I mean chapter 5 and verse one. From verse one the Bible says that and this day was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is uh at Jerusalem by the the the sheep market a pool which is called which is called in the Hebrew tongue but the shed having five porches. In this lay a great multitude of important folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water. Whosoever then fast after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made wall of of whatsoever this is he had. And a certain man was there uh which had an infirmity. Praise the Lord. An infirmity. And uh just a little And a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and 80 years. When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said unto him, wilt thou be made wall? The important man answered, "Sir, I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another stepped down before me." Jesus says unto him, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk." And immediately the man was made wall, and took up his bed, and walked, and on the same day was and and on the same day was the Sabbath. And the Jews therefore said unto him that that was cured. Is it the it is the the Sabbath day. It is not lawful for do for thee to carry thy bed. He answered them. He answered them. He that made me wall. The same said unto me, take up thy bed and walk. Then Jesus answered, I mean then asked they him, "What man is that which said unto thee, take up thy bed and walk?" And he said unto and he and he that was healed was not wilt not who it was. For Jesus had conveyed himself away, and a multitude being in that place. Afterward, Jesus finds himself in the temple and said unto them, "Behold, though at made wall, sin no more, lest a wise a one thing come upon thee." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then the man the man departed and told the Jews that that it was Jesus which had made him whole. Praise the Lord. Now we have looked at the first uh account of a man who was having ability to have people who were available at that time. Praise the Lord. This man here had the opportunity the first one who was sick of epilepsy. He had opportunity of having relatives and friends who were available to help him out. Praise the Lord. And because he was very far, he had to be carried out to the place where Jesus was found. Praise the Lord. And when they reached there, their faith was was really fulfilled as they expected. Praise the Lord. They desired only that if they could take him down, that would be enough. Whatever happens down was none of their business. Praise the Lord. Their faith was activated and they lowered the man down. And when a man reached down, God looked into their faith and told the man, "Your sins be forgiven." Praise the Lord. It was the sins which were to be forgiven first. And when the man's sin was were forgiven, even the epilepsy had to leave. Praise the Lord. Because when I pray for a person, sincerely praying for a person, a sick person laying hand on a sick person, even sins are forgiven. Praise the Lord. Because God forgives even sins. Now in this next account, a man who had a solution before him but never had accessibility to the pool. Praise the Lord. For he stayed there for a number of years sat 8 years but never had a way into the pool. Praise the Lord. The solution was near him was present was just in front of him for but year after year he couldn't access the solution. Praise the Lord. He just looked at other people go into the water because maybe they had a little strength to go through. Praise the Lord. They could manage to run because the water could be turned just trouble once for a season. So this man stayed for a number of years trying to hope that one day I'll be fine. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He never lost hope. Maybe among them one of them left. Maybe as among them some of them quit. Some of them could have lost hope. But this man continued living. Praise the Lord. Continue staying within the place without leaving, without friends, without relatives, without neighbors, without anyone even giving him hope. Maybe even others who could have got healed could have said, "Please, we have stayed here together. Let me help you, push you a little." Praise the Lord. But for them also after they were healed, they could go. Praise the Lord. Because everyone there was there expecting to be healed. That was their aim. Praise the Lord. And it was none of their business to see this old man out. Praise the Lord. SO THIS MAN STAYED THERE having hope that one day something would happen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There was no one who was around to help him. Everyone after getting held walked away and he could not have access to the water. Year after year no help but still believed. Now when we read up to verse seven, praise the Lord. verse 7 the Bible says that uh the same chapter 5 verse 7 the Bible says that uh uh the important man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled. Now this is Jesus now who was coming to into the place where this man had stayed for a number of years. Praise the Lord. Now when Jesus arrived into the place, he said that there was a certain man who was there which had infirmities 30 and 80 years. But when Jesus arrived immediately he rushed into this man. He did not go to anyone else. Praise the Lord. He just went to this man and say and saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in the case in that case and he said unto him, thou be made well? Praise the Lord. It was a question which was a simple which needed a simple answer. This this man now because he had stayed there for many years. He couldn't imagine that for many years eight years someone who could come and ask me such a question. What is this man trying to mean at this point? Praise the Lord. Maybe no one has ever come to approach him that way. For many years, no one has ever tried even to talk to him that way. Praise the Lord. But now this man is coming to tell me about the healing. Even the season is not yet. Which kind of hopes is this man coming to give me? Praise the Lord. That's why he answered and said that there's no man who can put me in. Praise the Lord. Because he knew the season would come, but there's no man who could put him in. Praise the Lord. Maybe he hoped that this man could come and put him in. Maybe the Lord Jesus Christ was going to do something. Then important man answered and said, "I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another steps down before me." Praise the Lord. Before he could get healed, another one gets healed. Praise the Lord. So this man had to continue the same cycle year after year. One year gone, he had to do the same thing. Praise the Lord. A second year at a certain point, he felt like it was just something normal to him. Praise the Lord. Maybe he got used to but a little hope continue keeping kept on him telling himself that I can stay here until I'm healed. Praise the Lord. So such a thing motivated him. He kept on hoping day by day. Every day that something will happen. Praise the Lord. The breakthrough will come. Somebody will have access. Praise the Lord. Will help me to access this water. Perhaps that was his hope. But I want to tell you sometimes that is the way how we think. Praise the Lord. We think sometimes that this is how God will help me out. Maybe you want to have a breakthrough financially. Now your mind is locked into money. That until God provides me money, that's when I will have a breakthrough. Certain ways God works in a way that we don't think. Praise the Lord. God can do certain things not in a way that we expect. Praise the Lord. Even when you're praying, God give me money so that I can do this. God give me this so that I can build a house. OR IF GOD CAN bless somebody to build for your house, hasn't it solved your problem? It should have solved your problem. Praise the Lord. Now this man continued waiting year after year. But he couldn't have any hope of anyone who could come. But now here appears the Lord Jesus Christ who was able to do a miracle to him. Praise the Lord. He was able to speak unto him just by word and he it was able to help him. Praise the Lord. You know in life that's where there are other problems that we face and our minds are locked into a certain solution that until this happens that's when this will happen. That's why there's difference different persons or group of people can access areas of interest but come out with different results or similar. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Some persons can go into a certain place. They are interested in a certain thing but they can come out with either a similar result or different results. Praise the Lord. While other people are not allowed to access certain areas and others allowed some are allowed to uh some are allowed to after uh some are allowed after a great investigation but others go through without any checking. Praise the Lord. Others have got the right to access certain places at any time while others do not have any access or hope to access certain things anywhere and any time they desire. Praise the Lord. Others can access at once and never hope to get again while others expect again and again. Praise the Lord. Others expect to go through certain places forcefully while others take close study before they get in. Praise the Lord. Others can access certain things due to influence by others and others can go by themselves. Praise the Lord. Others have got full authority to access certain things but do not care accessing them while others have had a desire. They have a desire to access a same similar thing that others desire but do not have access at all. Praise the Lord. Others are saying today is for so and so and I hope tomorrow it will be mine. Praise the Lord. You hope that today it is for brother so and so. That blessing is for certain so and so. Praise the Lord. That duty is supposed to be done by so and so not by me. Praise the Lord. But I want to tell you that all of us have equal rights before God. And when you desire something from God and you ask from by prayer, by faith, you ought to receive it. Praise the Lord. Because we serve one God and we have one faith, we have one hope, we have one love, one baptism, and everything is one. Praise the Lord. Well, now when you have such access, you have a desire, then why not let it be known to God and God will answer your prayer. Praise the Lord. Because sometimes the means may not be there of reaching the almighty. Praise the Lord. Because of maybe the hinderance of sin, maybe because of the hinderance of certain situations, maybe the hinderance of other people telling you that it is not possible for you. Praise the Lord. So we fail to access things while we are seated in our problems thinking that maybe it is for so and so. Praise the Lord. Others wish certain things to happen first before they can get something. Praise the Lord. Somebody will say that until I get married that's when I will start praying and fasting. Praise the Lord. Somebody will say that until I do this and that that's when this will happen. Praise the Lord. You keep waiting for certain opportunities to happen because such opportunities are not happening. So you keep pushing yourself into sin. Praise the Lord. You keep going deeper deeper into sin while hoping that until this thing happens that's when I will come out of this. Praise the Lord. You ought to have confidence and speak to the Lord and God is there to help you out. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God is always there to stand for you and God is always there to lift you up in every situation that you're in and every moment that you're in. Praise the Lord. You have access to the blood of the lamb and of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible says in the book of uh Revelation 3:20, "Behold, I sound at the door at knock." Praise the Lord. Now, we are going deeper into the access how to access the blessings of the Lord. Revelation 20, chapter 3 verse 20. Maybe we can get it through. Revelation 3:20. The Bible says that behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and I will swap him with him and he with me. Praise the Lord. Uh to him that overcomemeth will I I grant will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even with my father in his throne. Praise the Lord. He that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Praise the Lord. Behold, I stand at the door to knock. Now, at one point, we lived a life which was having no hope. We lived a life whereby we saw that it was all enough. Praise the Lord. We lived a life where we knew that I don't think I can come out of this situation. But at a certain point, God sent a man. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God sent a person. Praise the Lord. And that person God sent had faced maybe many troubles in life. Maybe a person riding a bicycle for long distances. Maybe a person spending fuel, a person spending time in prayer and fasting that God today when I go for evangelism. Perhaps I may win a soul to the to thy kingdom. Now a person has labored to try to do his best to reach you and for me. Praise the Lord. Now through that person, God came knocking your door. Praise the Lord. that you may open him to come in. And by knocking that door, you manage to believe. Praise the Lord. By the grace of God, you receive the true baptism. Praise the Lord. By the grace of God, you receive the Holy Spirit. By the grace of God, you are still living here today. Praise the Lord. Now, the Bible has told us that Jesus came knocking at your door. He needed accessibility to your place. Praise the Lord. He needed accessibility to your heart. He needed accessibility in your life. Praise the Lord. Then whatsoever you do, you needed to access it. Praise the Lord. Whatsoever which was binding you, you needed to go through in order to break it out. It took somebody somewhere somehow. Praise the Lord. Like the man who was epilepsy. It took some people to carry him maybe for a distance. It perhaps he was very heavy because he was just down. He was sick. Praise the Lord. But somebody was bearing him, carrying him while having hope and faith that this man will get healed. Praise the Lord. That is the same which has happened today. Brother, sister, somebody preach a gospel to you. Somebody came with the gospel preaching and telling you about the true word of God. Somebody came telling you this is what it takes for you to be a Christian. Somebody came and told you that you're lost. You're in a dying world. Praise the Lord. Come out of it. Praise the Lord. Somebody had to come sweating and taking nights praying for you and for me. Now that the Lord has knocked your door and you've opened, are you ready to knock at his door? Praise the Lord. Because the Bible says that knock and it shall be open. And seek and you shall find it. All those kind of things they are all abundantly before us. It only takes us to present ourselves before the Lord and the Lord will give it to us. Praise the Lord. Because we have the accessibility to everything that we desire. Let us not allow the devil again to access us through many things. Praise the Lord. You know the spirit of can influence you to go back to the certain old way of your life to start doing the same things that you used to do to remind you how good all of things were praise the lord you have heard a testimony the story which a prophet spoke about a certain girl I don't remember story very well but a girl who had been in a disco for a number of years but at a certain time when she WAS DELIVERED SHE WAS PASSING BY had the same music a certain group of people she was associate with and she decided to to move together with them again. She moved by and by. Let me just stand at the outside door. Let me just move inside a little. Let me NOT DANCE. LET ME JUST keep them watch. Let me just keep watching on them dancing. Praise the Lord. Before she knew, she was also doing it. Praise the Lord. That is the kind of habit that we need to kill in our lives. Because once we allow the spirit of the devil to access our lives, it is so difficult again for us to come out. Praise the Lord. It it takes the grace of God because the Bible clearly says that if one demon is chest away out of a person. They go out there in the desert loitering looking for so somewhere that they can enter while checking at their place. THE BIBLE SAID THEY go to the desert there. They just loitering. They don't have anywhere to occupy any place to occupy. Praise the Lord. They desire to come to the same person because they enjoyed being you in you during their time with you. Praise the Lord. They were enjoying because for you able to move at night, for you were able to steal, you able to speak lies, you able to do this and that. Praise the Lord. Those demons enjoyed being with you in you. Now that they have cast them out, they are desiring to come back to you again. And when they desire to come back to you again, that demons do not have anything. Praise the Lord. Demons simply use things that we God had already created. Because during the time during the time when the devil was cast down when Lucifer was cast down he was cast down without anything. Praise the Lord. The devil just had to come down to deise a mechanism on how best he could deceive a person. The devil couldn't GO BEFORE A PERSON DIRECTLY. He had to find a beast in the land. Praise the Lord. In the garden of EDEN THAT HE MAY enter through and go and deceive man. Praise the Lord. That is how the devil was trying. The devil always desires to use somebody somewhere. Praise the Lord. Use a certain thing in order to lure you into sin. Praise the Lord. Now the devil knows the things that you desired that you loved when you still in the world. Now the devil desires that access again to get into you. Praise the Lord. He desire that how best can I get back into my place. But because the weakest of the Christian when he kneels down to pray even the devil tremble. Praise the Lord. Now the devil understands EVEN THAT. NOW DO YOU know what the devil does? He makes sure that he gets more seven demons which are stronger than itself. Praise the Lord. Because he knows that even that weakest one who is so weak. It is hard for me to go there alone. I have to gather them them more of my which are greater than me. Praise the Lord. Now if you love the disco now the devil will come back with immorality. Praise the Lord. You love the things of the world more than you love it before. Praise the Lord. You desire to do them all the time. Now the devil because he has had an access back to you. But I would love that in contrary that let us have a desire always in our hearts that let God always have access and preminence in our lives. Let only God operates in your life day and night in and out of your house. Praise the Lord. At all time let it be God operate in your life. Because when you God operates in your life, there are always things that will may happen that you will always rejoice because God is present. Praise the Lord. There will be blessings that will come along your way. Nothing will hinder your blessings. Praise the Lord. Because you have accessibility to desire whatever you desire and you get from the Lord. The Bible say that knock and you maybe let us read in the book of Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 7 Matthew. Praise the Lord. Praise God. Amen. Matthew chapter 7:7. We are sharing accessibility or access. Praise the Lord. Verse seven says that ask and it shall be given to you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be open unto thee. Praise the Lord. That is a kind of attitude. For everyone that seeketh receiveth, and that and he that seeketh findeth, and he to him that knockketh, it shall be open. Praise the Lord. Oh, what what man is there of you? Whom his son asks for bread, will he give a stone? or if he asks a fish and will give him a serpent. If he had then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your father which is in heaven which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him. Therefore all things uh therefore all things whatsoever yet would that man men should do to you do do receive do even so to them for this is the the law and the the prophets. Praise the Lord. This is now the accessibility of a Christian. Praise the Lord. For we have seen the accessibility of the devil. When a devil accesses can access a person by all means by any way the devil will always torture that person scatter him and put him into pieces until even you can't recognize a person. But now the the grace and the mercy of God called you and me out that you and me may be may be saved out of this world of darkness. Now the Bible has given us a freedom access that we may go and seek from the father and he is ready to give you and for me. Praise the Lord. There's always a breakthrough where the demons do not have any chance to stand before a Christian. Demons do not do not have any opportunity to try even to come back to you. Praise the Lord. Because they know how much they are harmed day and night. Whenever you pray, whenever you read the word of God, whenever you listen to the tapes, praise the Lord. Sometimes I desire to listen to the tape, even when when I'm sleeping. Praise the Lord. I feel that atmosphere even when you wake up, you feel the preaching is ongoing. Praise the Lord. It catches all the demons away. I want to tell you whether I as much tired as I was, I'll wake up when I'm fresh and good. Praise the Lord. Because the atmosphere created around me had allowed the spirit of God to access our house. Praise the Lord. No demon could access it by any means. They couldn't stand before the presence of God. They couldn't share at all. Light and darkness cannot share together. One are to depart and one to come in. Praise the Lord. That is the kind of accessibility which every Christian ought to have in your life in every situation of your life. Praise the Lord. Because there's no situation which is permanent life. Every situation which may come, it will go. It will come and will go. Just your mentality, how you perceive it at that moment is what matters. How do you receive it and how do you solve it? Which kind of uh situation or how do you relate with the with the with the power that you have in you? Praise the Lord. When you look at a problem and you say that this is too hard for me. I don't think I may overcome. That one is for so and so. I think that one requires me to have a lot of money for me to get healed. Praise the Lord. It requires me to do this and that. Praise the Lord. It doesn't require to do anything. It is simply requires you to go before God and God will do it for you. Because you do not have any ability. It is God who has it for you. Praise the Lord. He died on the cross that he would set you free and you're free indeed. And your freedom is in Christ. Praise the Lord. Not in the things of the world. Do not judge your station by the things or the present station. Know that you're in Christ and Christ are s of it all. He say it is finished on the cross and all. It was finished. Now that you have accessibility to get your healing, to get your breakthrough, to get whatsoever you desire, brother, sister, why not wake up and do it? Praise the Lord. God is able to do it for you because he's a very present help in times of need. Praise the Lord. God is always present to deliver you out of every situation. No matter how hard it is, no matter how difficult it is, you may not be the one going through the situation. It may be your relative. It may be your friend. It may be so and so. But I want to tell you because of your faith, your desire for somebody to change, God can do it for that person. Praise the Lord. That's why we labor, we pray, we go to preach the gospel, we continue doing it. We don't give up. No matter how many will discourage you and me. Praise the Lord. No matter how many will discourage those who you have preached the gospel to, your work is rich gospel to them and the Lord will do the rest. Praise the Lord. God will convert their hearts. God is able to change them. God is able to mold them to the way that he desires them to be. Praise the Lord. HE'S ABLE TO TELL THEM TO COME OUT OF every situation that they are in. Praise the Lord. Some people have allowed access by some people get access. I mean some demons get access to people in many ways. Praise the Lord. Some could be out of maybe your family tree. They are just following the the kind of covenants that you maybe your elderly people made. Now they're trying to follow you up. They are trying to to tie you. You're not prospering spiritually, physically, and even with things that of life. You're not getting it all together. Praise the Lord. And they try to torment you. You try to think of a solution. Brother, there's no solution out of Christ. Praise the Lord. As long as you come to Christ, there's always a solution. Some demons can access you through the things that you love. Praise the Lord. The very things that you desire, maybe the phone, maybe you desire watching, maybe you desire doing this and that. Maybe you desire just moving around things, doing things which are not necessary all together. Praise the Lord. And there the demon can access you through that because you are so idol you do not have any idea of what you can do. Praise the Lord. The demons can come into your life and they will come and torture your life. Praise the Lord. But now that we are in Christ, brother, sister, let us rise up and that we know that God is here with us and to do something good for for me and for you. Praise the Lord. For God is calling for you and me into action. Praise the Lord. An action whereby you desire to be changed. You desire to be like him. You desire to be transformed. You desire to go to heaven. You desire to be not in by not to look like anyone in this world. Praise the Lord. But just to be like Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; because he's the one who has all in all that you desire. Praise the Lord. For God is able to deliver you, God is able to bring you out. For in this world that we are living in full of troubles, full of problems that can come into our lives at any time not invited by you or not desired by you. Praise the Lord that you just wake up, a problem has happened, tomorrow again you wake up, another one comes to pass. Praise the Lord. How do we overcome them? Praise the Lord. We need to believe that there's a reality that Jesus is coming back and there's a sudden coming of the Lord Jesus Christ which will come for you and for me. And there must be a desire in you to receive him because he's coming for a bride. Praise the Lord. He's coming for a person who is prepared. He's coming for a person who is active in the way of the cross. Praise the Lord who is carrying his cross while following the Lord Jesus Christ. Let him access your life and let him use you. Let him come into you and mold you the way that he desires you to be. Praise the Lord. Let him be your Lord and God everywhere you go. Be it at school, be it at home, be it with friends of the world as you're moving with them, be it with the Christians, whatever it may be, let it be God himself leading you at all time. Because when God has accessibility in your life, he's able to speak to you smoothly. Praise the Lord. He's able to dine with you just like it was Adam and Eve when the princess of God was coming. Praise the Lord. All of them could feel the sweetness of the presence of God. But now because of sin, sin had hindered them. Praise the Lord. To feel that princess. God had kept his promise. He was always coming at a certain time of the day. He was coming to speak to them. But because of sin, now in them they were trembling. They wondering what can we do now? How best can we let's run and hide? Praise the Lord. God was there still present to call unto them. God was still calling to them that he may make them right again. Praise the Lord. But because man has a habit, a desire not to expose his sin. Praise the Lord. He tries to hinder it by all means. Even when a preacher preaches, he doesn't care. I think it is for so and so. You see him refer in your mind. You refer to somebody maybe next to you. You refer to somebody maybe in your village. You refer to your brother maybe in another church. Praise the Lord. It is for so and so. It's a mentality built in you which you must break. Praise the Lord. Adam had to refer to Eve. Eve had to refer to the serpent. Praise the Lord. They kept on trying to manipulate things out to see how to get an excuse. Praise the Lord. Let God always come before you and find that you're ready to receive him. Let the atmosphere of God be before you at all time. Let it him come and dwell in your heart. Let him stay in you at any time that he desires. Praise the Lord. When he comes in the night, he desires to speak to you in a dream. Let him not find demons trying to struggle into your house. They feel like to enter into your house to come and torment you. Praise the Lord. But let there be an atmosphere created that he may speak to you smoothly. Praise the Lord. that may God have access to your life at all time. Because if God can access you when you wake up in the morning, if God can access you even when you're walking in the road, when when if God can access you even when you're at the workplace or you are at school, if God can access you even when you're on the bus or you're driving, if God can access you in all the situations, praise the Lord. My brother, my sister, we shall always rejoice because God will always do miraculous and wonderful things to our lives. If accident is on the way, God is there to access you. PRAISE THE LORD. THERE'S NO SIN WHICH IS HINDERING HIM from reaching you. Everything's perfect on time. Praise the Lord. And God will save you out of every situation because your accessibility is open. Your door is ready to receive him at any time. IF THERE'S A blessing that God is giving around the world to his brethren, to his children, God should count you also to be among those ones. &gt;&gt; If a job, God should say that I have a job for so and so in DVF also. Praise the Lord. If this marriage I have marriage for so and so in DV year. Praise the Lord. He should find you available to receive it. Praise the Lord. LET HIM NOT FIND YOU TRYING TO FIND your own solutions. Trying to manipulate how to do it in the best way that you think. Saul saw that by bringing those fatty bulls and those nice things before God is so that it could please God. He decided to deceive the prophet of God. It is how you tell that these ones I brought them purposely for for sacrifice. You know we have to sacrifice to our God. We have to do this. Praise the Lord. Here the instructions were go and destroy everything of Amalachites. Praise the Lord. It was supposed to be destroying everything. Never to spare anything because by sparing such things, such things could give accessibility of a devil to come and attack the nation. Praise the Lord. It happened during the time of Joshua when Akan had stolen those precious things. Praise the Lord. 36 I built about 36 soldiers died. It was an accessibility that was given to the devil to do his own things that he desired. PRAISE THE LORD. BECAUSE GOD'S PROMISE was that Joshua was going through every war. There will be nobody who would die. PRAISE THE LORD. BUT BECAUSE OF SIN THAT HAD come amidst, something had to happen. Praise the Lord. The soldiers died. Now Joshua goes back to God and tells God, please God, uh, you promised this and that. Praise the Lord. God say, "It is true. I promised, but it is you, your part which was not played well. Praise the Lord. And God because he's merciful, still he gives you instructions on what to do. He tells you do this and that for you to repent. Praise the Lord. Now therefore, you ought to repent of every sin that you have committed before God. Praise the Lord. Now, after Akan uh was identified with his family and destroyed. Uh Joshua went back to the battle and he was successful. Praise the Lord. God even gave him a strategy on how to overcome. You know, there are spirits that we are fighting against in this life. Praise the Lord. Sometimes we don't have ideas on how to overcome. Sometimes you feel like maybe I talk to pastor, maybe you would help me. Maybe I talk to brother so and so, maybe you will help me. But still that one also you're still debating, maybe it won't help me. Maybe let me go to church. Maybe I hear that pastor is preaching breakthrough. Let me go there. But that one also won't help you. You try all whatever you try, my brother. It takes you to present before God. When God presents you a solution, it's a solution which works. It doesn't miss. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It does not miss at all. God's solution will always work because Joshua after they have killed, they had killed 36 soldiers. God gave him instructions. Tell that some soldiers pass through let them go straight to the camp of your enemies. Let others go to the other side that you may lure them. These ones who go from the front where we leave them to run like they are they they are they they are being defeated then the other ones who have gone over the other side will come and destroy everything. Praise the Lord. It was not Joshua who devised the mechanism. Praise the Lord. It was not Joshua who sought it on his own. He waited on the Lord and God spoke to him. So if you wait on God, God will have a solution for you. As long as you allow him to do it, he will always do it. IF JOSHUA HAD come to to do it on his own, I wanted more people would have died. But because he need Joshua was so keen, he had to go back to the author of life. Praise the Lord. The author who gave him ability to fight every battle. He went back to him. He went and cried before the Lord and God answered his prayer. Praise the Lord. So God is able to access your life and is able to turn every situation upside down. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever it may be, there's no limitation. Praise the Lord. But as long as you're able to allow him coming into you, there's no nothing which cannot change. My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; this world seems like it is tormenting us. But as long as we have Christ in us, something must happen in order for you to have something. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There must be something that you should do. And that something is not on your own ability. It's by you letting it all to God. Just accepting that God, you can do it. And when you let it to God, God will surely do it for you. Praise the Lord. God will fight every battle that you have. God will make you have a breakthrough. God will tell you you can carry your bed and go back home if you are sick. Praise the Lord. God will tell you that whatever you desire, you have it here with me. I have here with me. I have let me present it to you and you take it with you. Praise the Lord. That is a kind of a mentality a Christian should have because demons do not own anything. Demons are always broke. Demons can just borrow things to use. They just borrow a body of a prostitute and he present before you a Christian brother. Praise the Lord. Delure you into sin. The devil does not come to you direct as a devil. Praise the Lord. He desires to go into a body of somebody that he may come deliver you into sin. He borrows even money and he deceives you THAT GO AND STEAL that money. I want to tell you something. You see the money which is stolen when you go and buy bread that person who who will receive that money will not say that this is fake money. Praise the Lord. That person will receive and use that money even for a blessing. But I want to tell you that the power which is embedded into that money that you have stolen. It is what the devil is after. Praise the Lord. The devil is using it as a means to access your life. Therefore, there's need for us to quit all these things and come into the Lord Jesus Christ. Let him be the one to reign over us at all time at all moment because he desires us to be changed. As we stand up now and you get into prayer, God desires a transformation. God desires a person who is ready to receive him at all time. We may stand up. God desires to be alone in your life. God desires not anyone to come to access you at at any point. Praise the Lord. Because he wants to be alone and alone in you. He desires that he should be alone at all time. He desires that even up to the time of rapture, he wants to be alone in you. Let not anything of the world lure you into sin or take you into captivity of the things of the devil. Praise the Lord. God is calling you softly and tenderly. Jesus is calling as we sing that song. Softly and tender. Jesus is calling. calling for you and for me. Hallelujah. See on the portal and watching watching for you and for me. Halleluah. Come home. Come home. Yeah.

We desire to be changed Lord Jesus. We desire to be transformed. We desire to be like you. We desire to go to heaven, Lord Jesus. But how how can we do that, Lord Jesus, except we allow an excess of thee to come into our hearts, Lord. That's why we have come this evening, Lord Jesus Christ. Knowing that, Father, whatsoever we desire is in you. Whatsoever we want is in you, Lord Jesus. Come down there for Lord and make a way for us. Let us have a way of escape. Oh, Lord Jesus Christ.
