[53:43] our heavenly loving father.
[53:46] Lord, we thank you,
[53:49] for this evening,
[53:53] for the word we have read this evening.
[53:57] But we pray you come
[53:59] speak to us, oh God.
[54:03] The Bible tells us that you're the God
[54:05] of all flesh.
[54:08] And he said, "And man shall not live by
[54:10] bread alone,
[54:12] but every word that proceeds out of the
[54:14] mouth of God,
[54:16] that you may come and do as you want
[54:22] full prep minutes in this ministry.
[54:25] Thank you for you've desired it.
[54:28] In the name of Jesus, we have prayed.
[54:30] Amen. Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. May have your seats.
[54:36] Amen. Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This evening,
[54:40] &gt;&gt; I have something that I want us to
[54:41] share.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; And I will call it
[54:51] &gt;&gt; uh
[54:56] anon time god.
[55:03] Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want us to talk about
[55:06] tonight.
[55:08] Praise be to God.
[55:11] Amen. And where we have read
[55:15] We saw in Habacook
[55:18] where God is instructing him
[55:23] to write the vision.
[55:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[55:28] Praise the Lord.
[55:31] Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; And here where we have read,
[55:36] we are seeing the Bible is telling us
[55:39] something.
[55:40] It's talking about seasons. He's talking
[55:44] about time for everything.
[55:47] Time for sowing,
[55:49] time for reaping,
[55:51] time for loving,
[55:54] and time for hating.
[55:56] Many times this scripture is read uh in
[56:00] funerals.
[56:03] Blessed be the name of the Lord. But
[56:05] today I want us to take it take another
[56:08] direction
[56:10] and I want us to talk about on time God.
[56:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. God who
[56:18] is never too late
[56:20] who is never on hurry.
[56:23] He will not rush but he always comes on
[56:26] time.
[56:29] Blessed be the name of the Lord and that
[56:31] is the God we are serving.
[56:34] He has never been too late
[56:37] in any situation.
[56:39] Praise be to God.
[56:42] God is not controlled by time.
[56:46] He is not like us
[56:48] for us. We are creatures of time.
[56:52] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[56:55] most time many times
[56:59] we look at time
[57:02] that time factor
[57:04] and you hear them say time is money time
[57:08] wastage never recover you're wasting a
[57:11] lot of time
[57:13] blessed be the name of the Lord. It is
[57:15] because we are precious of time.
[57:19] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[57:23] But when it comes to God, Hebrews 13:8
[57:26] tells us that Jesus Christ is the same
[57:30] yesterday
[57:32] is the same today
[57:34] and forever.
[57:36] It's only God who is the I am.
[57:40] Amen. Ever present God.
[57:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord. It's
[57:46] God who knows everything. It's God who
[57:49] sees everything. It's God who is even in
[57:53] next year
[57:55] from eternity to eternity is God.
[58:00] Praise be to God. Amen. That is the God
[58:04] we are serving.
[58:07] Blessed be the name of the Lord. He's
[58:09] the God of his word.
[58:12] His word cannot get old.
[58:15] It can't expire.
[58:17] It's always fresh.
[58:19] is always up to date.
[58:22] Blessed be the name of the Lord. When he
[58:25] spoke in Isaiah
[58:28] about the virgin birth,
[58:31] how the virgin shall conceive
[58:34] to bring forth a son. His name will be
[58:37] called, wonderful counselor, the mighty
[58:41] God, everlasting father. Praise be to
[58:45] God. Amen. It took many many years
[58:51] but it came to pass
[58:54] humanly speaking
[58:58] it was quite many years
[59:01] I think over 600 years.
[59:05] Praise be to God.
[59:07] Amen. But it came to pass.
[59:11] It never in fact it never delayed
[59:13] according to God's timing.
[59:17] It was just on time
[59:20] when Jesus was born. He was born in the
[59:23] right time.
[59:26] Praise be to God. And he never delayed.
[59:30] That was that was God's appointed time.
[59:34] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[59:37] Hallelujah.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm here to tell you this
[59:41] evening, our God is on time God.
[59:46] Whatever comes our way, whatever happens
[59:50] to us,
[59:52] Amen. It just happen in the exact time.
[59:57] That is the right time of that situation
[1:00:00] for that thing to happen.
[1:00:03] Amen. And God is watching it. And God
[1:00:07] knows it. He knows that it will happen.
[1:00:12] Praise be to God. Remember on Sunday,
[1:00:17] pastor was giving us a testimony
[1:00:20] about our land fund,
[1:00:24] how we used to do it
[1:00:27] and how he was inspired
[1:00:30] and how the things work.
[1:00:34] That was God's appointed time to work.
[1:00:40] And the same is happens in our life.
[1:00:43] Many time we have a lot of complaint
[1:00:47] because things are not working out the
[1:00:49] way we would wish.
[1:00:51] But I'm here to encourage you.
[1:00:54] Amen. God is just on time.
[1:00:58] It is not too late.
[1:01:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:01:04] Amen. Because the Bible tells us in
[1:01:09] just a day with the Lord
[1:01:12] a thousand years is equivalent to one
[1:01:14] day
[1:01:17] and one day is equivalent to a thousand
[1:01:20] years.
[1:01:23] So we are counting 2025.
[1:01:30] God is counting two days.
[1:01:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; So God always come on time.
[1:01:49] Whatever God does, always happen on
[1:01:52] time.
[1:01:54] Amen. Praise be to God. So whatever is
[1:01:58] happening around us,
[1:02:01] where we are today, the day we are
[1:02:03] living in,
[1:02:05] Praise be to God. As being in this
[1:02:07] generation,
[1:02:09] it's not a mistake.
[1:02:12] We are just here on the right time
[1:02:15] and we are the right vessel, the right
[1:02:18] candidate for this time.
[1:02:21] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[1:02:23] situation you are in tonight, the things
[1:02:26] you are battling with, God knows about
[1:02:29] them. Hallelujah. But in God's appointed
[1:02:33] time,
[1:02:35] is going to work it out for you are
[1:02:38] good.
[1:02:39] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:02:42] Hallelujah.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I want us to see things different way.
[1:02:47] Let us see the way God is seeing it.
[1:02:50] Let us judge it the way God is judging
[1:02:52] us.
[1:02:53] God uses his word.
[1:02:56] Praise be to God. All the promise he
[1:02:59] gave us in his word,
[1:03:01] it cannot fail that it will come to pass
[1:03:05] in God's appointed time.
[1:03:08] Praise be to God. Remember the Bible
[1:03:11] tells us whatever we desire when we
[1:03:15] pray, we believe and we shall have it.
[1:03:21] He never see that whatever you desire
[1:03:25] when you pray, you now have it.
[1:03:32] Faithically speaking,
[1:03:36] faith
[1:03:39] you have it.
[1:03:43] But you say whatever thing we desire
[1:03:47] when we pray we believe and we shall
[1:03:50] have it. Amen.
[1:03:53] So many time we are prayed for
[1:03:57] and maybe you are sick and you go home
[1:04:00] and you're still sick
[1:04:02] and you're like I just not
[1:04:05] but he said you believe
[1:04:08] he said whatever thing you desire when
[1:04:11] you pray believe and you shall have it.
[1:04:16] As long as faith is there, much as you
[1:04:19] have not seen it, it's there. Just keep
[1:04:23] believing.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] Lord,
[1:04:31] maybe he didn't mean it.
[1:04:39] Those were days of Jesus. Whatever thing
[1:04:42] you desire,
[1:04:46] When you believe,
[1:04:48] you already have it.
[1:04:51] Hallelujah. Not feeling it,
[1:04:54] you already have it.
[1:04:57] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So the
[1:04:59] God we serve on time God.
[1:05:04] He he answers our prayers
[1:05:07] just on time.
[1:05:11] When David was being anointed
[1:05:14] They thought David was young.
[1:05:19] Maybe even some thought that the prophet
[1:05:22] has wasted that anointing.
[1:05:26] How can you anoint this little boy?
[1:05:31] What is he going to do?
[1:05:35] Yet we are here giants,
[1:05:38] well trained armor officers.
[1:05:43] Blessed be the name of God.
[1:05:46] But that was God's God was not making
[1:05:48] any mistake.
[1:05:51] He knew what he was doing and he was
[1:05:54] doing it on time.
[1:05:57] Blessed be the name of the Lord because
[1:06:00] when you read that scripture,
[1:06:02] you'll realize
[1:06:04] uh in uh
[1:06:07] 1 Samuel
[1:06:10] From
[1:06:14] the time David was anointed
[1:06:18] to the time
[1:06:21] he killed Goliath,
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; it was not long period.
[1:06:27] Praise be to God.
[1:06:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That David was
[1:06:32] being anointed
[1:06:35] and maybe they thought he was young.
[1:06:38] He could not do anything.
[1:06:40] But God,
[1:06:42] Amen. He was preparing him to face
[1:06:45] Goliath the other side.
[1:06:48] And the Bible tells us Goliath that
[1:06:50] challenged Israelite
[1:06:53] for 40 years.
[1:06:56] Praise be to God.
[1:06:58] Amen. But there is a little boy anointed
[1:07:02] for maybe just few weeks who is going to
[1:07:06] put him down.
[1:07:08] Why? Because it was God's appointed
[1:07:12] time.
[1:07:14] That was the right time
[1:07:17] for the job.
[1:07:19] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:07:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:07:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:27] So our God
[1:07:29] is an ontime God.
[1:07:34] Praise be to God. If we look at our
[1:07:37] lives,
[1:07:39] Well, there are things you are battling
[1:07:40] with.
[1:07:42] You have battled with it for so long,
[1:07:45] maybe for years, maybe two years, maybe
[1:07:49] 8 months or 10 years until you feel like
[1:07:53] you feel like giving up.
[1:07:56] Maybe God is not mindful about.
[1:08:00] But I'm here to tell you, I'm here to
[1:08:02] give you another report. That is not
[1:08:05] what God is saying.
[1:08:07] He knows what you're going through. He's
[1:08:10] washing it.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; He's seeing it.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; He's going to come just on time
[1:08:20] and that habit will vanish away.
[1:08:24] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Many
[1:08:27] time we want to hurry God.
[1:08:30] We want to quicken God. People who act
[1:08:34] like catisting
[1:08:37] the reaction
[1:08:39] is not our God. God is not creature of
[1:08:43] time.
[1:08:44] He's an eternal God.
[1:08:47] Amen. From everlasting to everlasting
[1:08:51] is God.
[1:08:54] So he worked his way.
[1:08:56] He has his own pace.
[1:09:00] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:09:02] Hallelujah.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; You see even in our daily life
[1:09:09] you can't join primary level today
[1:09:13] and then tomorrow you are sitting for
[1:09:14] primary leading exam
[1:09:17] but you have to follow all the
[1:09:18] procedures.
[1:09:20] You go through all the lower classes
[1:09:24] first classes then you go to higher
[1:09:26] institution of
[1:09:29] amen. And I believe that's how God
[1:09:31] works.
[1:09:33] He has his own time.
[1:09:35] Each one of us, we have our own time.
[1:09:39] And when that time reaches,
[1:09:42] nothing can stop that process.
[1:09:46] Stop that growth.
[1:09:48] Hallelujah. However much the devil,
[1:09:52] it will become unstoppable.
[1:09:56] Hallelujah. Amen. Why? Because it is
[1:10:00] God's time.
[1:10:02] God's time to work.
[1:10:04] God's time to operate.
[1:10:07] Frustration will have to obey.
[1:10:12] Amen. If it is cancer,
[1:10:15] it will have to go away because this the
[1:10:18] master's time.
[1:10:21] It is the first time for everyone.
[1:10:24] Blessed be the name of the Lord. But one
[1:10:27] thing we have to do
[1:10:29] Let us keep believing the word,
[1:10:32] keep standing in the word.
[1:10:36] Praise be to God. When it is God's time,
[1:10:43] no matter how hard things look to be,
[1:10:46] thing will have to give way.
[1:10:50] Blessed be the name of God. I was
[1:10:53] reading a quote.
[1:10:55] Brother was talking about uh uh a
[1:10:59] brethren who saw
[1:11:02] something in a cocoon
[1:11:07] and then they kind of wanted to help it.
[1:11:14] How many know?
[1:11:19] Yes,
[1:11:22] there are stages of uh some insects
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:29] they go through stages
[1:11:32] maybe two maybe three
[1:11:36] egg
[1:11:39] then the l stage.
[1:11:42] Yeah. If you look at livestock of
[1:11:44] butterfly.
[1:11:47] Amen.
[1:11:49] It has I think has those three stages.
[1:11:53] The first one the egg then the lover
[1:11:57] then after
[1:11:59] that lover will make a cocoon
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:04] preparing for another stage
[1:12:08] and it can be there for I think even for
[1:12:10] a month
[1:12:13] until you may think that there is no
[1:12:14] life in there.
[1:12:18] I remember when we were young, we used
[1:12:20] to stuff those cocoons,
[1:12:23] but when you tear it out, you realize
[1:12:26] there are some worms inside.
[1:12:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:12:33] Then after cocoon,
[1:12:36] nothing will burst into a butterfly.
[1:12:41] Praise be to God. And even in our life,
[1:12:44] in our Christian world,
[1:12:47] There is a time you reach
[1:12:51] and you think you are not progressing
[1:12:54] and you think you have done everything
[1:12:57] but it's like there's no result.
[1:13:00] Brother sisters, something is happening
[1:13:04] because it's not your working, it is the
[1:13:07] working of God,
[1:13:09] it is God working it out.
[1:13:12] Amen.
[1:13:16] And say if they remove that thing out of
[1:13:19] that
[1:13:22] in case it survive
[1:13:29] it will not have strength.
[1:13:34] I remember when I was young
[1:13:37] and we had a we had a hen which was
[1:13:40] hatching
[1:13:42] and after it was done normally there are
[1:13:46] those eggs which remained behind
[1:13:49] but if you shake them you hear chick
[1:13:51] crying in
[1:13:55] so what we used to do
[1:13:57] like cotton
[1:13:59] and you cover it with cotton
[1:14:02] most time After the head has hatched
[1:14:05] majority of the egg,
[1:14:08] they tend to ignore
[1:14:15] whether some chicks are crying there. It
[1:14:17] doesn't matter. But if you try to force
[1:14:20] that chick out of that
[1:14:25] in most cases will not even last for two
[1:14:27] days.
[1:14:30] And yet there are others will last.
[1:14:34] grow and even produce more needs.
[1:14:39] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Why?
[1:14:41] Because God has his own providing.
[1:14:47] So for you, for us many time praying
[1:14:49] that we are helping God.
[1:14:53] We are worsening the situation.
[1:14:57] Amen. But let God arrive
[1:15:01] on his own time,
[1:15:03] brother. Nothing will hinder God.
[1:15:07] Nothing will stand on our way.
[1:15:10] Amen. Amen. Because our boss has
[1:15:12] arrived.
[1:15:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So that
[1:15:18] is the God we are serving.
[1:15:21] We at the moment
[1:15:23] we are seeing how things are. And if you
[1:15:26] look at it physically speaking,
[1:15:30] it's like things are down.
[1:15:33] Praise be to God.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; But I also believe
[1:15:37] this is God's appointed time
[1:15:41] for us to take a step.
[1:15:44] Amen. And because this God's appointed
[1:15:47] time, it's God's right time, we are
[1:15:51] seeing something is happening.
[1:15:55] Amen. There is something going on
[1:15:59] both in the spiritual
[1:16:02] and the physical. Blessed be the name of
[1:16:05] the Lord. So don't be scared.
[1:16:08] Don't worry because things are tough.
[1:16:13] Because you are battling with a habit
[1:16:16] to come and sit in the service.
[1:16:18] If you get out of the church,
[1:16:21] you already under bondage again.
[1:16:25] Brother, sister, there's nothing you can
[1:16:27] do over that.
[1:16:30] The only thing you have to do,
[1:16:33] let God.
[1:16:36] Let go and let God handle it.
[1:16:41] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Because
[1:16:44] God knows it.
[1:16:47] One thing that encourages me most
[1:16:51] to know that I'm not here for my own
[1:16:55] somebody's property.
[1:16:57] I belong to a God
[1:17:00] who created heavens and earth.
[1:17:03] Amen.
[1:17:05] Say as long as you are still breathing,
[1:17:10] there is chance.
[1:17:13] Amen. As long as you are still alive,
[1:17:16] brother, you are still progressing.
[1:17:20] You are still pressing on. You are still
[1:17:23] moving forward.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; When you find yourself alive
[1:17:30] that God has given you grace,
[1:17:33] don't mourn.
[1:17:35] Don't be discouraged.
[1:17:37] Amen. Amen. But tell God since she have
[1:17:40] gave me another chance.
[1:17:43] I am pressing on the upward way.
[1:17:47] Amen. Amen. Every single day, the bride
[1:17:51] is pressing the upward way. We are not
[1:17:55] going the backward way. He found us when
[1:17:58] we are going the downward way. He
[1:18:01] changed our destiny.
[1:18:03] He showed us the right path.
[1:18:06] Let's have it on the right way.
[1:18:08] And from that time
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; we are moving forward.
[1:18:13] Hallelujah.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; The message the footprint on the son of
[1:18:19] child time.
[1:18:22] It talks of a brother. This brother he
[1:18:25] saw a vision. Oh it was a dream how he
[1:18:29] was walking with the Lord.
[1:18:32] But there is where when he reached the
[1:18:33] hard the hardship she ship
[1:18:36] he honors his one footprint.
[1:18:41] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I say
[1:18:44] this is being unfair.
[1:18:46] When things are okay
[1:18:50] I'm seeing two foot
[1:18:52] but when things are tough I'm only
[1:18:55] seeing one foot.
[1:18:58] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And you
[1:19:00] know what the answer was?
[1:19:03] When you reached there,
[1:19:05] it was me walking.
[1:19:08] I was carrying you on my path.
[1:19:11] Blessed be the name of the Lord. That is
[1:19:13] the God we are serving.
[1:19:16] When we reach a sharp edge,
[1:19:19] when we reach a razor edge,
[1:19:22] the Lord carries us on his back and he
[1:19:25] walks alone.
[1:19:27] Praise be to God. And when we when we
[1:19:30] reach where you can walk,
[1:19:33] he puts you down. So let us walk
[1:19:36] together.
[1:19:37] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So many
[1:19:40] time
[1:19:42] during that time of silence.
[1:19:45] It is because
[1:19:47] you are not hearing anything
[1:19:50] because somebody is scaring you.
[1:19:53] Somebody's working for you. Somebody's
[1:19:56] working out something for you.
[1:19:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord. That is
[1:20:02] the God we are serving.
[1:20:04] He always has come on time.
[1:20:08] Praise be to God where we read in Habac.
[1:20:12] He says write the vision
[1:20:15] put it on the wall
[1:20:17] it will.
[1:20:21] Amen. when he says it will t
[1:20:25] and again he came back and said
[1:20:28] it will not
[1:20:30] it will come to pass
[1:20:33] whatever thing God has promised us
[1:20:36] it may seem that has taken long time
[1:20:39] but brother sister
[1:20:42] is just on the way
[1:20:46] amen he said we shall possess the gates
[1:20:49] of our enemies
[1:20:52] No matter what comes our way, that word
[1:20:55] is turning night and day
[1:20:58] of our
[1:21:00] we are possessors
[1:21:03] and we must possess
[1:21:05] because it was declared.
[1:21:08] It was decreed
[1:21:10] and that's what we are. Possession is in
[1:21:13] our DNA.
[1:21:16] Victory is in our DNA.
[1:21:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Healing is part of us
[1:21:23] in seven language.
[1:21:26] Praise be to God. Your body is made up
[1:21:29] of all these things.
[1:21:33] Yes sir.
[1:21:35] It's made up of vision,
[1:21:38] healing,
[1:21:39] love, peace, meekiness.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; It take the Holy Ghost
[1:21:50] to quicken those elements
[1:21:53] for us to see it working.
[1:21:56] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[1:21:59] very God who promised and said he shall
[1:22:00] t
[1:22:03] but it will not turn.
[1:22:06] It will come to pass. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:09] when it tries
[1:22:12] because we are looking at it in a human
[1:22:17] way.
[1:22:19] Yes,
[1:22:22] there it is.
[1:22:26] But according to God's way
[1:22:28] of working,
[1:22:30] it has not taken long brother.
[1:22:33] It is just yesterday.
[1:22:36] It is just here.
[1:22:39] Praise be to God. When God promised
[1:22:43] the birth of Christ to prophet Isaiah
[1:22:47] after he declared,
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, the priest of them days,
[1:22:55] he was going Jesus was going to be born
[1:22:59] in the king's palace.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:05] And we believe
[1:23:07] that virgins were preserved
[1:23:12] maybe parents could tell their children,
[1:23:15] "Oh my daughter, there is this promise."
[1:23:20] We started reading it before even your
[1:23:22] father. And I believe that day.
[1:23:26] I think
[1:23:28] boys were
[1:23:35] H sorry the girls
[1:23:38] were the ones
[1:23:41] when you give birth to a boy those days
[1:23:49] when you give birth to a son you say
[1:23:51] I've missed to give birth to the virgin
[1:23:53] that will give birth to the Messiah
[1:23:55] praise be to God
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; and we believe they reserve they
[1:23:58] preserved them
[1:24:01] according to their
[1:24:04] of doing things.
[1:24:07] The prophecy took over 600 years
[1:24:11] according to a human way of seeing
[1:24:14] things.
[1:24:17] According to God's way,
[1:24:20] it was not even a day.
[1:24:24] Praise be to God.
[1:24:29] How many do you think waited?
[1:24:40] We have waited. We have read these
[1:24:42] things in the archive in the library.
[1:24:51] 100 years, 200 years, 500 years.
[1:24:59] Praise be to God.
[1:25:01] That was according to their timing.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; But when God's time arrived,
[1:25:13] oh brother, sister.
[1:25:16] Hallelujah.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; One day, Mary was somewhere. She was
[1:25:21] doing some work somewhere.
[1:25:24] She had a visitation.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The time had arrived.
[1:25:32] Angel came
[1:25:34] at the wrong time.
[1:25:37] Hallelujah.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe that day many woke up differently.
[1:25:46] Yeah. Because even the rapture
[1:25:49] when we are going, the Bible says
[1:25:51] some of us will not take us unaware.
[1:25:55] shall know his homegoing time
[1:25:59] and we shall start gathering.
[1:26:02] We will be seeing the saints.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; The bitters.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:10] Those brethren who died who rested in
[1:26:13] the Lord and we shall know your sister.
[1:26:18] I will tell my wife my dear Winnie
[1:26:23] going time.
[1:26:25] Hallelujah.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Although my wife will be the one to tell
[1:26:29] me
[1:26:30] because if you read the Bible
[1:26:33] most time it is sisters who have many
[1:26:37] angel of visitation
[1:26:41] maybe we come back from the from work.
[1:26:45] I tell him my dear
[1:26:47] I saw Sah
[1:26:50] I I will ask you mean Sah our daughter?
[1:26:54] Oh, the son of the Bible.
[1:26:58] Have you ever seen your
[1:27:01] say? Oh, yes. And maybe when I still be
[1:27:04] I will be there asking questions.
[1:27:09] You look like both said you are right.
[1:27:13] It's going time.
[1:27:15] Praise be to God. I believe Mary that
[1:27:18] day.
[1:27:20] Oh brother or sister,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; maybe she woke up singing a song
[1:27:25] of the redemption story.
[1:27:28] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden,
[1:27:34] it was there.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] Brother says, "No man is is in his right
[1:27:53] mind until receive Christ."
[1:27:59] When they hear us saying these things,
[1:28:02] they think we are just playing around.
[1:28:06] Brother, sister,
[1:28:08] amen. That morning or that afternoon,
[1:28:12] the hand of his lady Mary,
[1:28:15] it was God's appointed time.
[1:28:19] Amen.
[1:28:22] It never even took God one day.
[1:28:25] It took God a half day.
[1:28:29] Hallelujah.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the word outside
[1:28:33] the religious men of them days
[1:28:36] of that day
[1:28:39] for them to say this thing is taking
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:46] we have saved these girls. Let them get
[1:28:51] you saved the virgins. They are only God
[1:28:55] had a special one.
[1:28:59] Hallelujah.
[1:29:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Mary was in the lamb's book of life
[1:29:07] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:29:10] again, she was the one
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; to bring forth the Messiah.
[1:29:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:19] I trust the angels were watching the
[1:29:21] calendar.
[1:29:24] Amen. And that morning, God did not have
[1:29:28] to remind Gabriel that go and deliver
[1:29:31] the message.
[1:29:35] He knew his assignment.
[1:29:38] Praise be to God. And here on time,
[1:29:43] he came down. Today brethren,
[1:29:47] today we are seeing confusion in message
[1:29:50] churches,
[1:29:52] denomination,
[1:29:54] in the world. We are hearing words funny
[1:29:58] things happening
[1:30:02] in churches
[1:30:07] until sometime you feel like
[1:30:10] you want to be discouraged.
[1:30:13] But if I ask you a question this
[1:30:15] evening,
[1:30:16] you mean God is not seeing that.
[1:30:20] God is seeing it, brother, sister.
[1:30:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; He knows how to handle that.
[1:30:29] And just on time,
[1:30:32] hallelujah, he's going to do reshuffle.
[1:30:37] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Just
[1:30:40] cling to the word.
[1:30:42] Let us move forward.
[1:30:44] Let us lay aside every weight
[1:30:47] to the sin
[1:30:49] that was easily set.
[1:30:52] Let us look into the word of God.
[1:30:56] And let us know that we are just here on
[1:30:59] the right time.
[1:31:03] Amen.
[1:31:04] That you are the bride of Christ.
[1:31:08] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:31:10] talk of Hebrew children
[1:31:13] when they going to be cast into the
[1:31:14] fire.
[1:31:16] I believe it was not the first time for
[1:31:18] them to see somebody being cast in that.
[1:31:23] They knew very well how it was how it
[1:31:25] consumes
[1:31:28] because they were there for many years
[1:31:31] and remember those days
[1:31:34] punishment was punishment.
[1:31:37] Either you obey the law or you are
[1:31:39] killed.
[1:31:41] They knew what that fire could do.
[1:31:45] Praise be to God.
[1:31:48] But they knew their promise.
[1:31:52] They were updated with Daniel's prophet.
[1:31:57] Hallelujah. And they knew their time was
[1:32:00] ded.
[1:32:02] Yes, sir. And the king to instill
[1:32:05] warfare in them.
[1:32:08] He commanded it to be uh to be
[1:32:11] multiplied seven times.
[1:32:16] Blessed be the name of the Lord. But the
[1:32:19] prophet says that God came into the fire
[1:32:23] and removed that flame that removed that
[1:32:26] burning element in the fire.
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:31] And the king saw his guys in fire
[1:32:34] and they were not being consumed.
[1:32:37] What happened?
[1:32:39] God came on time.
[1:32:43] He quenched the violence of fire.
[1:32:48] Praise be to God.
[1:32:50] My brother, my sister,
[1:32:53] is an on time God.
[1:32:56] He will always come to us on time.
[1:32:59] Are you battling with something?
[1:33:01] You have something waited so long.
[1:33:04] God is going to come on time.
[1:33:08] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let us
[1:33:11] just keep moving.
[1:33:14] Do you know that even the devil is not
[1:33:16] affected by time?
[1:33:22] Yes. It's only us who bypass our
[1:33:25] theophony.
[1:33:30] the one who could say time.
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:35] I'm getting all this.
[1:33:37] I'm finished. What can I do?
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Then when you go to the mirror,
[1:33:42] it magnifies the problem.
[1:33:46] You even forget to look at what is in
[1:33:47] your bag on your eyes.
[1:33:51] You look at the wrinkles
[1:33:54] on your beard
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; and you start struggling with it.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because creatures of time
[1:34:07] and because the devil knows
[1:34:10] that that puts us on pressure.
[1:34:14] If the devil is not on pressure,
[1:34:18] he's not been affected by time.
[1:34:22] Yes, the devil works night and day.
[1:34:25] He has worked for 2,000 years.
[1:34:28] Even right now, he's working. And if
[1:34:31] you're not careful,
[1:34:33] he's even ministering to you somewhere
[1:34:35] there.
[1:34:38] You feel that you are tired
[1:34:40] by the what is what what what is the
[1:34:42] time?
[1:34:46] The brother is not finished.
[1:34:49] is ever on job.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; It is only us
[1:34:55] who many times
[1:35:03] I am 50 years.
[1:35:06] Why should I marry
[1:35:09] children? My children will call me
[1:35:11] grandpa.
[1:35:13] How many grandpas have died?
[1:35:20] How many people have been called grandpa
[1:35:23] and because they aged so they died
[1:35:27] pressure and fear.
[1:35:31] Hallelujah.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want to tell me
[1:35:35] that God who created you,
[1:35:38] if you look at the mystery of birth,
[1:35:41] out of millions and millions of your
[1:35:43] brothers and sisters,
[1:35:46] you managed to cross over
[1:35:48] and you became that life
[1:35:52] and God is just washing at you.
[1:35:56] You are doing your best
[1:35:58] because there's something you can do.
[1:36:01] The Bible says the bride has made us off
[1:36:03] rich.
[1:36:04] So the bride has got something to say
[1:36:07] and you God is just washing at you.
[1:36:11] You are 30 40
[1:36:13] 60 70 until now now you no longer you
[1:36:17] are back and
[1:36:20] God is just
[1:36:23] getting what is coming.
[1:36:25] No sir,
[1:36:26] if there is a purpose,
[1:36:30] there must be a way provided
[1:36:34] must come to pass.
[1:36:37] Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] But God will always arrive on time.
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:46] Even when you're on your deathbed,
[1:36:51] it is God's appointed time. He
[1:36:57] will visit you brother,
[1:37:00] he will come there.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; The situation will change.
[1:37:06] You will go, you will turn back on your
[1:37:09] foot.
[1:37:10] You will go do your best to serve God.
[1:37:16] So our God is on time God.
[1:37:20] Amen. Amen. We just need to be updated.
[1:37:28] is going on
[1:37:31] many time I've heard our pastor telling
[1:37:33] us that it's not me saying this
[1:37:40] but it is an inspiration and God has
[1:37:42] given me this and this
[1:37:46] brother that is it
[1:37:50] is the time
[1:37:52] for us to do something.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. These guys they
[1:37:57] knew that that fire would consume.
[1:38:01] But still they say even if
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; but again they say
[1:38:09] he's more than able.
[1:38:12] Praise be to God.
[1:38:15] Hallelujah.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:27] I want to quote something for you here.
[1:38:35] In the message, God keeps his word. The
[1:38:36] prophecy,
[1:38:39] I just love that
[1:38:41] when I think of that,
[1:38:44] just at that crucial time,
[1:38:47] he is not one minute late.
[1:38:52] He's always just on time.
[1:38:55] If you can just be like that
[1:38:59] or we try to push the thing,
[1:39:03] we try to make it our time.
[1:39:08] Let us try to make it our time.
[1:39:12] Amen. But let God work it out
[1:39:17] on his own time.
[1:39:20] Praise be to God.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] In this message, he say that and it's
[1:39:27] very seldom I ever hit anything that I
[1:39:29] that I make anything out of
[1:39:37] but I was thinking
[1:39:40] just before I reached down to get this
[1:39:44] that what that I'm try that uh I try
[1:39:48] going to try to say to you
[1:39:53] I was staying off Israel down in Egypt
[1:39:57] and they were slaves
[1:39:59] and yet they were children of God.
[1:40:03] Well, we all know the story.
[1:40:06] And if they throw if they throw them
[1:40:09] molded bread,
[1:40:21] they had to eat it.
[1:40:24] If they
[1:40:27] if they if they refresh their daughters,
[1:40:33] they they kill their sons
[1:40:35] and whatever they did,
[1:40:38] it was just done.
[1:40:43] What will you do? They were slaves
[1:40:46] and yet them were the chosen
[1:40:53] with a promise waiting
[1:40:57] until the time of fulfillment.
[1:41:01] You hear that?
[1:41:05] Whether their girls were raped,
[1:41:09] whether their daughters were killed or
[1:41:11] sedu
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:20] and yet they were chosen children of
[1:41:22] God.
[1:41:24] They were elected
[1:41:26] of God.
[1:41:29] Amen.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; But what was waiting was
[1:41:35] until the time of the fulfillment.
[1:41:40] Hallelujah.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; When that time has not come yet,
[1:41:46] even if you dance on the needle,
[1:41:50] even if you hold and cry,
[1:41:55] nothing will happen.
[1:41:57] Why? Because God knows what he's doing.
[1:42:02] Hallelujah. He want you to go through
[1:42:05] that
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; when you come out of that situation,
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; you will be in position
[1:42:12] to encourage others
[1:42:16] and tell them, "Hey boys,
[1:42:19] it works.
[1:42:22] Yes, I lost my first child
[1:42:27] 10 years ago,
[1:42:30] but today
[1:42:31] I can encourage somebody
[1:42:35] and tell him my brother
[1:42:37] the Lord gives the Lord takes.
[1:42:42] Amen. I am still alive.
[1:42:46] Blessed with men and daughters.
[1:42:50] No wonder God has given him many and
[1:42:52] daughters.
[1:42:55] Praise be to God.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; He has paid you with a bonus.
[1:43:00] You knew how painful it was.
[1:43:04] Do you know what? When that happened,
[1:43:10] people blamed me. Some if not majority
[1:43:13] blamed me.
[1:43:16] How can you take your wife to go and
[1:43:18] deliver from the village?
[1:43:21] How dare you taking her country?
[1:43:25] I sit in the village every woman who
[1:43:28] gives birth children like
[1:43:35] praise be to God.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:43:42] But God knew what he was doing.
[1:43:45] I knew that she was going to give a to
[1:43:47] give birth to a baby girl.
[1:43:50] I knew that very well. Heard her name. I
[1:43:54] know she was going to deliver. Normally
[1:43:56] they called me and told me they were
[1:43:59] going to uh your wife is going to uh to
[1:44:02] be to to to be operating
[1:44:05] because the baby has taken long and long
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:10] but I never saw that
[1:44:13] and what I saw coming
[1:44:20] it was not part of the package.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; I said no. I remember that evening it
[1:44:24] was our next day.
[1:44:27] I was from church.
[1:44:29] Amen. I reached around Zana roundabout.
[1:44:33] They called and gave me that
[1:44:34] information.
[1:44:36] I said I'm not going to go back.
[1:44:39] Let me I started praying from there
[1:44:41] going back to church
[1:44:44] said let me go spend a night there
[1:44:45] praying for my wife.
[1:44:48] Praise be to God.
[1:44:50] By the time I reach church compound, if
[1:44:53] I've not forgotten,
[1:44:55] I received another call
[1:44:58] that she has delivered normally.
[1:45:02] Praise be to God.
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:08] So humanly many time we tend to rush
[1:45:17] that is in our nature.
[1:45:21] You have no coin.
[1:45:24] You believe God for for money.
[1:45:28] Every time
[1:45:33] midnight is four.
[1:45:46] You get your phone and start scrolling.
[1:45:49] [Music]
[1:45:56] This one is demanding.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; You would have hoped me back.
[1:46:06] Why
[1:46:08] preachers of time?
[1:46:11] I remember one preacher say that most
[1:46:15] times
[1:46:16] it's when the angels are just backing at
[1:46:19] you.
[1:46:20] They're beckoning at you that we are
[1:46:22] coming
[1:46:25] and brother is already turning his back.
[1:46:27] He's going back.
[1:46:29] God has not answered
[1:46:32] after fasting for three days.
[1:46:37] Have you ever found someone who think he
[1:46:40] has been disappointed by God crying?
[1:46:46] It is different crying.
[1:46:57] Praise be to God.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; But that is not the case.
[1:47:02] God comes on time.
[1:47:06] It's not just God's time.
[1:47:10] Amen.
[1:47:12] Have you sought for the Holy Ghost
[1:47:15] for two years now
[1:47:17] and you're not receiving?
[1:47:21] Amen.
[1:47:24] He's just going to come on time.
[1:47:28] Maybe you'll be singing a special song.
[1:47:33] And before you realize the church,
[1:47:34] everybody's crying.
[1:47:37] You're touched by the song.
[1:47:40] And before you realize, you are singing
[1:47:42] in tong.
[1:47:45] Hallelujah.
[1:47:47] before you realize the pianist playing
[1:47:50] it song
[1:47:54] is God's time.
[1:47:58] Hallelujah.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what we are looking at
[1:48:04] on time. God
[1:48:07] when Lazarus died
[1:48:10] oh they mock Martha.
[1:48:14] Where is that guy? The one who saved us
[1:48:16] from the other lunch when we went where
[1:48:18] we had no money.
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:22] He when he made bread he multiply those
[1:48:25] fish
[1:48:26] and take long without eating it
[1:48:31] and you say it's your friend
[1:48:38] he's dying
[1:48:43] and maybe after very many words
[1:48:47] Lazarus died.
[1:48:50] Mary cried.
[1:48:53] Mary cried.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; But Jesus,
[1:49:00] he was he was seeing vision and
[1:49:05] he was seeing a drama.
[1:49:09] Praise be to God. He was 100% God, 100%
[1:49:14] man.
[1:49:18] Hallelujah.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe was communicating Lazarus's soul
[1:49:23] one or the other.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; First day
[1:49:31] they will say he had fainted.
[1:49:38] They will say second day they will say I
[1:49:42] can even spend two days in coma.
[1:49:46] But remember when you're in coma
[1:49:50] there is something moning your heart
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:49:59] second day.
[1:50:03] Are you in the st

[1:50:26] but he's going to resurrect.
[1:50:34] Muslims you die. Why
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; for us Christian we say
[1:50:43] we shall raise the dead.
[1:50:47] Hallelujah.

[1:50:50] on the fourth day
[1:50:54] Jesus tells the disciple
[1:50:56] now is the time. Let's go do the
[1:50:58] father's business.
[1:51:01] Yeah. offering Lazarus is isolate.

[1:51:24] he said he's dead.
[1:51:28] That is different.
[1:51:30] Praise be to God.
[1:51:33] But God was not too late.
[1:51:38] When Jesus arrived,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; he came. The clock was ticking.

[1:54:20] No sir. God is going to answer us on
[1:54:24] time.
[1:54:27] His own time. God.
[1:54:29] I was reading a quote here. Because of
[1:54:32] time I may not go there. Yeah. Say that
[1:54:35] God
[1:54:36] spoke, he laid the seed
[1:54:40] before the foundation of the world.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; He laid the seed there.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; So when the world was in that mess
[1:54:50] mixed up,
[1:54:52] that seed was there and God spoke the
[1:54:56] word.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:01] and the word was manifested.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And as I'm finish this, I'm finishing
[1:55:07] this quote, he says,
[1:55:10] "And like in God's appointed time,
[1:55:14] time for fulfillment,
[1:55:17] but there came a day. They had got so
[1:55:21] far away from it.
[1:55:24] They don't recognize it.
[1:55:27] They don't know when the time come, but
[1:55:31] God always is on time.
[1:55:35] Yes, they never knew
[1:55:40] the time when the deliver was going to
[1:55:43] be born.
[1:55:46] Here Moses was born
[1:55:49] just on time.
[1:55:52] Praise be to God.
[1:55:55] He's on time. God gone.
[1:55:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Now that is what is the matter with the
[1:56:03] Pentecostal today.
[1:56:06] They don't recognize the time is here.
[1:56:10] The time has come.
[1:56:12] God promised to be God's promise to be
[1:56:14] fulfilled.
[1:56:17] Amen.
[1:56:19] Brother, the time has come.
[1:56:22] Amen. Let us just keep pressing on.
[1:56:29] Jesus promised us
[1:56:32] that is coming for us
[1:56:34] is 2,000 years.
[1:56:37] But he said in my father's house, I'm in
[1:56:41] a mansion. If it wasn't so, I would have
[1:56:45] not told you. But because I'm going to
[1:56:48] the father, I'll come for you.
[1:56:52] Amen. In God's appointed time,
[1:56:56] he has sent the prophet through the
[1:56:57] ages.
[1:56:59] Send preachers.
[1:57:01] They sent evangelists,
[1:57:04] teachers, apostles.
[1:57:07] Amen. They are preaching night and day.
[1:57:10] They are laboring night and day for the
[1:57:13] perfection of the bride. And in God's
[1:57:16] appointed time,
[1:57:18] just one time
[1:57:21] is coming for us.
[1:57:24] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Our God
[1:57:27] is a seasoned God.
[1:57:30] He will always come on time. That's why
[1:57:32] I said there's time for everything.
[1:57:35] There's time for my trial.
[1:57:38] And when I'm destroyed,
[1:57:41] I will tell God. Help me endure.
[1:57:45] Help me stand firm. Help me stand still.
[1:57:50] praise God. When Job was being tried,
[1:57:56] Amen. He endured,
[1:57:59] it was his trying moment.
[1:58:02] But when the time for fulfillment had
[1:58:06] come,
[1:58:08] God himself
[1:58:10] just on time after he had complained
[1:58:15] and said I wish I knew where God's face
[1:58:18] I knew is gone.
[1:58:20] Hallelujah. Many time we complain
[1:58:25] almost God is
[1:58:29] then God just arrived on time.
[1:58:34] Job,
[1:58:36] where were you?
[1:58:39] He started asking him question.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; When Jesus felt like giving up the call.
[1:58:51] Amen. And he prayed, "Father, if it's
[1:58:54] possible,
[1:58:56] he was negotiating with the father,
[1:59:00] if it is possible.
[1:59:03] Take this cup away.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Just on time.
[1:59:09] Hallelujah.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Just on time
[1:59:13] on mountain transfiguration.
[1:59:18] He arrived on time
[1:59:22] and he was encouraged.
[1:59:26] So he's on time. God

[2:04:55] that happened shortly after my girl had
[2:04:57] got burnt.
[2:05:01] Praise be to God. But God arrived on
[2:05:04] time.
[2:05:06] He bathed me out and I'm to today. I'm
[2:05:10] still moving on.
[2:05:13] Praise be to God. And you are telling me
[2:05:15] that something will kick me and I I will
[2:05:17] go on.
[2:05:20] No, brother, no sister.
[2:05:22] What I know God is the driver.
[2:05:27] He's leading this journey.
[2:05:29] I never called myself.
[2:05:32] Yes. How many how many people you
[2:05:35] started with on this journey
[2:05:38] and they they already they fell off
[2:05:42] but God has always been there and is
[2:05:45] leading. May God bless you.

[2:06:23] for you to deliver them. But Lord, they
[2:06:27] just woke you up on time. And you say,
[2:06:30] "Peace be still." And there was peace.

[2:07:24] that God is watching us and we will know
[2:07:28] that we always arrive on time.
