[43:39] pray amen
[43:42] amen we are going to be reading from The
[43:45] Book of
[43:47] Luke chapter 22
[43:53] L Luke chap 22
[44:08] 31 amen you love the
[44:12] word amen
[44:14] amen vers 31 uh up to
[44:17] 34 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold
[44:22] Satan has desired to have you that he
[44:25] may sift you as we
[44:28] but I have prayed for thee that thy
[44:31] faith fail not and when thou art
[44:34] converted strengthen thy Brethren and he
[44:37] said unto him Lord I am ready to go with
[44:40] thee both into prison and to death and
[44:44] he said I tell thee Peter the coke shall
[44:46] not craw this day before that thou shalt
[44:50] thri deny that thou knowest
[44:55] me look uh I for
[45:49] amen amen you may be
[45:53] seated that is I do not remember the
[45:56] title but there is a subject I
[45:58] ministered here some time
[46:05] back there is a um a subject I
[46:08] ministered here at the
[46:11] church and also uh on zoom zoom um but
[46:16] it was connected
[46:18] to uh Believing on the
[46:24] Lord Believing on the Lord Jesus
[46:27] CHR and I remember I read the scripture
[46:29] in the Book of
[46:31] Luke where the disciples are having um
[46:35] you know being released from the prison
[46:37] by the by the angel of the
[46:46] Lord uh when they when they came out
[46:49] then they were with this man
[46:57] and he asked them what what shall I do
[47:01] to be
[47:02] saved what shall I do to be
[47:05] saved and the jail the disciples
[47:08] answered
[47:10] him believe on the Lord Jesus
[47:13] Christ you and your house and you shall
[47:16] be
[47:17] saved so and then out of that I spoke to
[47:20] you on Believing on the Lord Jesus
[47:25] Christ Jesus is the word and if you
[47:29] believe the word you receive eternal
[47:32] life but you see today i' would like us
[47:34] to take another
[47:37] Corner because you see many people
[47:40] believe in believing the
[47:44] word many believe on accepting the word
[47:47] agreeing with the
[47:49] word and by the way most of the
[47:52] denominations claim to believe the word
[47:58] even many in our churches of the
[48:00] [Applause]
[48:01] message claim to believe the
[48:05] word but you see last time I spoke on
[48:08] three kinds of
[48:11] Believers so then what kind of believer
[48:13] are
[48:15] you and I spoke on the first group which
[48:18] is the um the
[48:22] nonbeliever the nonbeliever what he does
[48:25] is he will come in
[48:28] he will sit under the preaching of the
[48:31] word you will hear the word but as long
[48:34] as the pastor is preaching things that
[48:36] are are nice for
[48:40] him as long as the pastor is encouraging
[48:44] him telling him you are
[48:47] same child of
[48:49] God you are going to The
[48:52] Rapture you are going to be
[48:54] blessed and you know we all love that
[48:57] and so this nonbeliever will love
[49:01] it and he will remain in the
[49:04] church and he can be sometimes he can
[49:07] tend to be a very good church
[49:10] member but if the pastor there in that
[49:14] church or the preachers in that
[49:17] church if they take the word without
[49:21] having any gloves on the
[49:24] word and they preach it the way it is
[49:28] and it convicts this
[49:29] man it condemns
[49:32] him he sees that he's
[49:35] wrong he will feel bad and a prophet
[49:40] said immediately he will not wait he
[49:42] will
[49:45] leave because the word has judged
[49:49] him and he will disbelieve the
[49:52] word and he will refuse it
[49:56] judge he will say the preacher is
[49:58] judging
[50:00] me and he will walk
[50:02] away and let me surprise you sometimes
[50:05] they walk away and they come
[50:08] back sometimes they walk away and and
[50:11] linger and go
[50:14] back but as long as the word is
[50:18] preached hear me Church the nonbeliever
[50:21] cannot sit under the preaching of the
[50:23] word and remain
[50:28] that's why you should always watch
[50:30] people who leave or who go out in the
[50:32] middle of the
[50:36] preaching especially when is very
[50:39] hot when the word is very
[50:42] hot they walk out usually these people
[50:45] are
[50:48] nonbelievers I am not guessing at it I'm
[50:52] the are you hearing me man beli in him
[50:57] or in her she or he cannot stand the
[51:06] word when it comes like a
[51:09] fire he rejects it and he walks away
[51:13] that's the
[51:15] nonbeliever but then there is another
[51:18] group says that the nonbeliever is not a
[51:20] pain at all because for him he walk he
[51:22] walks away
[51:31] but the real
[51:34] problem is the make
[51:37] believer the make a Believer can stay
[51:40] for a really long
[51:45] time the word will be
[51:48] preached the make believer will
[51:51] stay many times make
[51:57] but you see one thing about the make
[52:01] believer they will never genuinely
[52:04] believe the
[52:07] word they will always linger and stay
[52:11] around wait for an
[52:16] opportunity they will wait for an
[52:18] opportunity for a
[52:20] gap where they can be able to point at
[52:23] at the Believers
[52:27] a place where they can be able to fold
[52:29] the
[52:33] word for example you've seen many of
[52:35] these come to
[52:37] church and they will stay around for
[52:39] even
[52:40] years but they they are the ones who
[52:43] know everybody who has done
[52:48] everything actually our Prophet even
[52:50] said they have long
[52:53] ears they hear everything
[52:56] they are the ones who go into everyone's
[53:01] matters they will never be in matters of
[53:04] the people filled with the Holy
[53:07] Ghost be in matters they will know who
[53:09] has done what in the
[53:12] church these ones they will they will be
[53:14] the ones who tell you so and so it's not
[53:16] a good
[53:18] believer theying men and
[53:23] women and you know listen carefully make
[53:26] Believers are very
[53:28] [Music]
[53:29] dangerous because they can be a
[53:31] stumbling block in the
[53:34] church these ones they will
[53:36] stay but you see the moment they see
[53:39] someone you know oh see now the other
[53:42] one has has committed
[53:47] adultery and I told you this church is
[53:49] not
[53:50] right I told you thech is not
[53:53] standing you see now what the other is
[53:57] the people in this church don't love
[53:58] their
[53:59] words the people in this church have a
[54:02] problem the young people in this church
[54:04] are not
[54:06] saved there is a problem in the
[54:08] church these ones are the ones who
[54:10] always see that the church is
[54:15] falling they will never see anything
[54:17] that God is
[54:20] doing they will never talk about what
[54:22] the holy spirit is doing
[54:26] they will always talk about what is
[54:28] going
[54:29] wrong and the prophet also said the
[54:33] example of a make believer is
[54:37] Judas they always they have their hand
[54:40] on the
[54:42] money they love
[54:45] money makeever love money
[54:48] like they can sell the they can sell the
[54:51] gospel or they can sell Christ in just a
[54:54] moment
[54:57] as long as they're going to benefit
[55:00] financially they can do
[55:03] anything without any
[55:06] conviction and then you wonder are you a
[55:08] genuine
[55:10] believer and the sister they wish he was
[55:12] in the church for a long
[55:14] time you mean a man can just give you
[55:17] money and you forget about the
[55:20] message and you forget about what you
[55:23] believe simply because of money
[55:26] those are the ones who fall in the
[55:28] category of brother
[55:32] Judas they betray the
[55:35] word Judas he betrayed Jesus
[55:39] Christ and you know those are the make
[55:42] Believers and then we talked about the
[55:44] genuine
[55:46] Believers and we saw that the genuine
[55:49] believers they may not have perfectly
[55:52] changed yet
[55:56] but when they come under the
[55:59] word they hear the word they get
[56:02] convicted when the word is
[56:05] preached if they are doing something
[56:08] wrong in their
[56:09] life and they hear the word being
[56:13] preached they are preached in their
[56:16] heart they are easily
[56:18] changed when they hear the word it
[56:21] convicts it touches their
[56:23] heart they respond to the word
[56:28] the word and you see the life of the
[56:31] word always follows their
[56:36] life the real
[56:39] believer you know he doesn't want to
[56:41] hear
[56:43] anything he only wants to hear the word
[56:46] the
[56:48] word the real believer came to church
[56:50] for one
[56:53] reason the word
[56:56] not how others are doing it not to see
[56:59] the life of other people they don't care
[57:02] whether someone is a hypocrite or
[57:05] not they only care about one thing I am
[57:09] here because of the
[57:11] word I believe every part of
[57:15] it when you preach
[57:18] something and their life is
[57:24] condemned break down
[57:27] in the presence of the Holy
[57:29] Spirit and their prayer will be oh God
[57:32] change
[57:35] me you see why because they
[57:39] believers they don't just sit there and
[57:42] they said for someone
[57:44] else they shall always receive
[57:47] it that's why we should always you know
[57:51] cheer the
[57:53] word Believers always cheer the word
[57:57] you cannot sit there like a
[58:00] Catholic you cannot sit there like an
[58:03] Ang or like a
[58:05] Baptist Baptists these days are even
[58:08] better than some
[58:11] Pentecostal they receive the word they
[58:14] Rejoice at the word a real
[58:17] believer Fired Up by the preaching of
[58:20] the
[58:23] word amen amen because all of us have
[58:28] emotion but you see a prophet
[58:31] said that you see for us our
[58:35] emotions are on the things of
[58:38] God for them their
[58:41] emotion they make a Believer will come
[58:43] in
[58:49] church but when they go out put on this
[58:53] you know what do you call it soccer or
[58:59] football that's when you knew this
[59:01] person has always
[59:03] beeno I did not know I thought they were
[59:07] silent
[59:08] people you mean by can
[59:12] jump of course you're a genuine believer
[59:14] I'm just giving an example you mean he
[59:17] can
[59:18] jump what
[59:20] happened but what why is he jumping
[59:23] because of the football team
[59:27] [Applause]
[59:28] you know when he comes to
[59:31] church very
[59:33] quiet very silent
[59:35] brother very calm others are dancing and
[59:40] rejoicing you know
[59:42] happy amen shouting running
[59:46] around this one is
[59:49] quiet he's just looking
[59:51] around what is happening with these
[59:53] people look at this now the mucus is
[59:58] cry that one is a make a
[1:00:01] Believer but the genuine believer
[1:00:04] doesn't care who sees
[1:00:06] them the only thing he Minds
[1:00:09] about is to be in the inner
[1:00:13] ve only thing mind about is to be in the
[1:00:17] amen the presence of the
[1:00:21] Shak where the presence of God comes
[1:00:24] down
[1:00:26] sister it fires you
[1:00:28] up brother it fires you
[1:00:31] up amen when I pach something condemns
[1:00:34] your
[1:00:35] heart as long as you a
[1:00:38] Believer you will say
[1:00:41] Amen in other words yes Lord change
[1:00:44] me amen do I have some real Believers
[1:00:49] tonight praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:00:52] amen and so tonight I want to speak on
[1:00:54] conversion
[1:00:58] conversion yes and so we see here that
[1:01:02] you can believe the
[1:01:05] word when you are not
[1:01:08] converted so you see we have we have
[1:01:10] seen we have many types of
[1:01:12] Believers but there is one type of
[1:01:16] believer that will be
[1:01:19] converted praise the name of the Lord
[1:01:21] amen and we know there are three
[1:01:23] stages of Grace if you will
[1:01:27] the first being
[1:01:29] justification you know this is when you
[1:01:32] are a
[1:01:33] sinner but when you hear the word the
[1:01:37] word touches you and the word pulls you
[1:01:41] and so you believe the word and when you
[1:01:44] believe the
[1:01:45] word you know you you you you come and
[1:01:49] you know where the word is being
[1:01:52] preached and so you respond to the word
[1:01:57] and I'll tell you what happens under
[1:02:00] justification you know you remain the
[1:02:02] way you are you have the only desires
[1:02:05] you
[1:02:06] had but when you come under the
[1:02:09] word you know you come Desiring to be
[1:02:15] changed you come with the old
[1:02:19] appetites but you know willing and
[1:02:22] expecting for God to Mo
[1:02:28] amen and and so then the next thing
[1:02:30] begins to take
[1:02:31] place as you sit under the
[1:02:35] word the word like I told you daily it
[1:02:38] begins to wash
[1:02:41] you cut things from
[1:02:44] you and this is happening in each of our
[1:02:48] lives every day being
[1:02:51] changed every day Christ is molding his
[1:02:54] character us
[1:02:57] amen amen and so then after that he
[1:03:01] fills you with the baptism of the holy
[1:03:05] spirit so now the first believing you
[1:03:09] believed amen you believed
[1:03:13] unto you know believing alone does not
[1:03:16] give you the holy
[1:03:19] spirit let me put it this way believing
[1:03:23] in itself
[1:03:26] does not mean you have received the Holy
[1:03:30] Spirit does not be does not also mean
[1:03:32] you
[1:03:34] converted that's why many times you can
[1:03:36] find people in
[1:03:38] church for very many
[1:03:41] years but they have never been converted
[1:03:44] fully never been
[1:03:47] converted when you are
[1:03:49] converted there are certain things you
[1:03:52] cannot
[1:03:53] do when you you are
[1:03:56] converted you are totally
[1:04:00] changed and the life of Jesus is now in
[1:04:06] you and you living above amen your
[1:04:11] flesh
[1:04:13] yourh is still you
[1:04:20] know but you see you have a life of
[1:04:22] Jesus in you
[1:04:26] and the life in you of Jesus
[1:04:29] Christ is the power amen that helps you
[1:04:32] to live above the
[1:04:36] flesh it puts the flesh under
[1:04:41] subjection amen and then you realize you
[1:04:43] cannot do the things you used to
[1:04:46] do why because you are
[1:04:50] converted you can no longer talk the way
[1:04:52] you used to
[1:04:54] talk because you
[1:04:56] ConEd many Believers start this journey
[1:04:59] but they do not go all the
[1:05:03] way some of them even think by believing
[1:05:06] the message they have received the Holy
[1:05:11] Spirit listen to me tonight you can
[1:05:14] believe the
[1:05:16] message and still fail to go in the
[1:05:21] Rapture the message is not the ticket to
[1:05:24] the rapture
[1:05:28] why have people who believe that
[1:05:32] tonight the message of the
[1:05:36] hour is not the ticket to the
[1:05:39] Rapture you must believe the message of
[1:05:42] the
[1:05:43] hour but after believing the
[1:05:47] message then the life of the
[1:05:49] message the Holy
[1:05:52] Ghost should come in your life
[1:05:56] should come and abide in your
[1:05:58] soul now that is the thing that Christ
[1:06:01] will look
[1:06:04] for that is the
[1:06:06] oil and every believer needs to be
[1:06:09] filled with this
[1:06:13] oil amen we have been given the
[1:06:16] prescription on how to receive the Holy
[1:06:22] Spirit by Apostle Peter in the book of
[1:06:24] Acts
[1:06:28] 2 verse
[1:06:29] 38 listen carefully
[1:06:32] church then Peter said unto
[1:06:34] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:06:39] you in the name of Jesus
[1:06:42] Christ for what for the remission of of
[1:06:45] of
[1:06:46] sins and he shall receive the gift of
[1:06:49] the Holy
[1:06:50] Ghost now number one a person must
[1:06:57] repent number two they must be baptized
[1:07:01] in
[1:07:02] water in much water in the name of Jesus
[1:07:08] Christ amen and number
[1:07:11] three Jesus will wash away their
[1:07:16] sin
[1:07:20] sanctify that's the work of
[1:07:22] God number four
[1:07:25] filled them with the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:28] Spirit
[1:07:30] now how come that many can stay in
[1:07:33] church and they say I was I I
[1:07:38] repented I was baptized in
[1:07:40] water but I don't have the Holy
[1:07:43] Spirit is that
[1:07:45] possible that is not possible tell your
[1:07:48] neighbor that is not
[1:07:51] possible if you do not have the Holy
[1:07:54] Spirit
[1:07:56] having been baptized in much
[1:07:58] water in the name of Jesus Christ it
[1:08:02] means there is a problem
[1:08:04] somewhere and I will tell you where the
[1:08:06] problem should might have started
[1:08:10] from first thing that must be
[1:08:13] done amen by a person who wants to be
[1:08:19] converted is they must
[1:08:22] repent of their sins now what is sin sin
[1:08:27] is unbelief of the
[1:08:29] word now
[1:08:31] repentance many people think is
[1:08:36] confession there is a difference between
[1:08:39] confession and
[1:08:42] repentance right confession might be
[1:08:44] part of
[1:08:46] repentance but it is not
[1:08:49] repentance
[1:08:51] repentance is when when you were going
[1:08:54] this direction
[1:08:57] and then you decide to turn
[1:09:00] around and go another
[1:09:03] direction are you hearing me
[1:09:06] church if you have been a
[1:09:08] thief and you hear the
[1:09:11] gospel you repent of of
[1:09:15] stealing so from
[1:09:18] today going to
[1:09:20] steal I have decided to follow Jesus
[1:09:25] repentance is a
[1:09:28] decision to live the wrong way and
[1:09:30] follow the right
[1:09:33] way amen I have been living this kind of
[1:09:37] life I've been living in
[1:09:40] adultery
[1:09:41] fornicator I've been a liar I've been
[1:09:45] dressing
[1:09:46] badly I've been believing the wrong
[1:09:50] Doctrine even goes to what you have been
[1:09:53] believing
[1:09:56] I've been believing the wrong
[1:09:58] Doctrine but from
[1:10:00] today having heard the
[1:10:03] word I have
[1:10:05] decided to leave
[1:10:08] everything and follow
[1:10:10] Jesus I have decided to forsake my
[1:10:15] boyfriends to forsake the world to
[1:10:18] forsake you know
[1:10:20] sin and I
[1:10:22] decided to follow the word with all my
[1:10:25] my
[1:10:27] heart amen amen I have decided to cut
[1:10:31] myself
[1:10:33] away from you know even social media you
[1:10:36] know chatting that are wrong that
[1:10:41] are you see you see repentance is done
[1:10:45] in your
[1:10:48] heart you may confess but if you confess
[1:10:50] something which you have not you know
[1:10:52] fully done in your heart
[1:10:57] you just wasting your time so we have
[1:11:00] many
[1:11:02] Believers soall
[1:11:04] believers who have not truly repented of
[1:11:09] their they are in
[1:11:11] charge
[1:11:13] baptized but they never
[1:11:16] repented and that is why even when they
[1:11:20] are
[1:11:21] baptized they can never receive the Holy
[1:11:23] Spirit
[1:11:25] it is
[1:11:27] impossible because you see the bis
[1:11:30] is a person must
[1:11:35] repent amen repenting is leaving your
[1:11:39] wrong
[1:11:41] way but many people what do they
[1:11:44] do they leave some
[1:11:48] things and repent some
[1:11:51] things and that is why they can never
[1:11:54] overcome
[1:11:57] because you see this thing remain in
[1:11:59] their
[1:12:01] life devil has a claim on you
[1:12:05] still brother
[1:12:07] sister amen the moment you truly
[1:12:12] repent amen of all your sin and you
[1:12:15] truly
[1:12:18] decide say I will let nothing between
[1:12:25] my soul and the
[1:12:27] Savior nothing
[1:12:30] between amen all this worldly worldly
[1:12:33] you know
[1:12:35] things all these pleasures of the
[1:12:38] world the lust of the flesh the pride of
[1:12:42] life I will let from today I will let
[1:12:48] nothing the you do
[1:12:50] that you are going to be a candidate
[1:12:55] the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:00] Ghost but before you do that you can be
[1:13:03] baptized one million times still you
[1:13:06] won't be
[1:13:09] converted amen and we have many
[1:13:11] believers who are
[1:13:14] unconverted unconverted why are they
[1:13:17] unconverted you know they are in church
[1:13:19] many you know even sisters they are
[1:13:20] dressing properly
[1:13:26] you know why like I thought she's
[1:13:29] converted dressing oh my listen dressing
[1:13:33] properly is only a sign you are
[1:13:39] Sanctified you have left
[1:13:42] something you know
[1:13:45] sanctification bres you away from
[1:13:47] certain
[1:13:50] things but it does not amen inoculate
[1:13:53] you from going back
[1:13:58] that's why you can overcome for a
[1:14:01] while and then you are defeated
[1:14:04] again in the same thing you had
[1:14:08] overcome that is why is very very
[1:14:15] difficult for you to overcome only by
[1:14:20] works that is why we do this message is
[1:14:23] not a message of
[1:14:28] works it is a message of
[1:14:32] Grace that you see we are putting the
[1:14:34] emphasis on the wrong
[1:14:38] place and we as preachers we are guilty
[1:14:41] of
[1:14:43] that we have put our emphasis on the
[1:14:46] wrong
[1:14:48] place we have overemphasized for people
[1:14:50] to dress properly
[1:14:55] we have overemphasized for people you
[1:14:57] know to stop smoking
[1:15:01] stoping
[1:15:04] fornicating and you know what the people
[1:15:07] will stop those
[1:15:09] things because you know you show them in
[1:15:12] the word it is wrong to do these
[1:15:15] things and they believe the word so they
[1:15:19] will decide to stop on their
[1:15:23] own see these people are not
[1:15:27] converted soon after they have stopped
[1:15:31] one week they stop two weeks they stop
[1:15:33] and then the third week they go back
[1:15:34] again in the
[1:15:43] same why because they were doing their
[1:15:46] own
[1:15:49] works works failed and works are failing
[1:15:52] and works will always fail
[1:15:59] let me tell you amen let me tell you
[1:16:02] something even when you receive the
[1:16:05] perfect baptism of the Holy
[1:16:08] Ghost in your soul amen you will begin
[1:16:12] doing the works of that Holy
[1:16:16] Spirit and that Holy Spirit abides in
[1:16:20] you and the works of the Holy Spirit can
[1:16:23] never fail
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:27] it can never
[1:16:29] fail are perfect
[1:16:32] work because it is the working of God in
[1:16:38] you so we should go back to emphasizing
[1:16:43] on people being filled with the Holy
[1:16:48] Ghost amen amen you as a
[1:16:51] Believer you should quit worrying about
[1:16:53] what you can do and what your
[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:16:58] failure qu worrying about your
[1:17:02] failure and then all all the time you
[1:17:04] are
[1:17:05] worried you can't even come to church
[1:17:09] because you fear God May slap
[1:17:12] you God may take you to Hell in a moment
[1:17:15] because you know how bad you are and you
[1:17:18] know what we have received
[1:17:20] instead we have received a bunch of
[1:17:23] Hypocrites in the church
[1:17:29] Hypocrites in form of
[1:17:32] Believers each of them is living a dir
[1:17:37] life but they're claiming to be genuine
[1:17:41] Believers are you telling me that God
[1:17:44] can give his
[1:17:46] word and he fails to accomplish
[1:17:49] it if he sa he will fill you with the
[1:17:52] Holy Ghost
[1:17:55] something is able to
[1:17:58] do stop
[1:18:00] trying stop
[1:18:02] pretending you a failure admit accept
[1:18:09] it when you
[1:18:11] accept you cannot
[1:18:14] rest you cannot
[1:18:17] rest until God fills
[1:18:20] you with a
[1:18:22] power which will help you get truly
[1:18:28] converted amen hallelujah amen
[1:18:32] hallelujah amen why do we live under
[1:18:37] privileged and we accept a makeover a
[1:18:41] makeup instead of accepting a real
[1:18:45] thing if our work is
[1:18:49] proper and the preacher work is
[1:18:53] proper then his and his the preacher
[1:18:57] work is
[1:18:59] proper then God is
[1:19:02] work will be
[1:19:05] proper what is our
[1:19:08] work our work is
[1:19:12] repentence when you hear the word God
[1:19:15] expects you to truly
[1:19:19] repent many say they have repented
[1:19:23] then they say they have
[1:19:26] repented but in behind the closed
[1:19:30] doors they have not really
[1:19:35] repented have you repented from
[1:19:39] fornication but on your
[1:19:42] phone you know you have
[1:19:45] not you're still
[1:19:48] chatting with those same same
[1:19:51] people you know it in your heart
[1:19:55] you have you are you have not
[1:19:57] repented because when you
[1:19:59] repent you are tired of
[1:20:02] sin I'm tired of sin and straying
[1:20:08] Lord Lord I'm done with this now when
[1:20:13] the moment the day you reach that
[1:20:15] place you have
[1:20:18] repented when he said
[1:20:21] Lord enough is enough of
[1:20:26] kill me or change
[1:20:29] me where are where are believers that
[1:20:32] that kind of
[1:20:36] desperation kill me or change me I am
[1:20:39] tired of this
[1:20:41] situation I am tired of this
[1:20:44] life I need a
[1:20:47] change you are tired of that
[1:20:51] life you are tired of that of living
[1:20:53] that way
[1:20:56] you know that's why repentance usually
[1:20:59] is followed with
[1:21:05] tears
[1:21:09] tears
[1:21:11] tears praise the Lord amen amen I was a
[1:21:16] very good lover of of of
[1:21:19] TV television you know what our Prophet
[1:21:22] speaks on television
[1:21:25] and so uh when we got married with my
[1:21:30] wife we have a little time so you have
[1:21:33] to be a little faster so I I I got you
[1:21:35] know this television in my
[1:21:38] home and so I put it up there and um you
[1:21:42] know zuku I think it was at that
[1:21:44] time and so I we started watching you
[1:21:47] know these kind of series and whatever
[1:21:49] whatever have
[1:21:52] you you know and the things started
[1:21:55] getting a hold of
[1:21:57] us Slowly by slowly caping us and you
[1:22:03] know and you know I was preaching even
[1:22:05] at the
[1:22:07] time and I did not see anything wrong
[1:22:09] with
[1:22:10] that you see and and you know when you
[1:22:13] repent of something you are not ashamed
[1:22:15] of testifying about
[1:22:19] it that's how you know someone truly
[1:22:23] repented and so shortly we we started
[1:22:26] failing to go to midweek
[1:22:30] Services why because there is a sched
[1:22:33] you know TV program we have to
[1:22:38] watch our family outs were we always
[1:22:42] with crying and praying and but now it
[1:22:44] changed because we would always push it
[1:22:46] and then we first watch these things and
[1:22:48] then we pray at one when we are very
[1:22:49] tired and just
[1:22:58] and so the power of God
[1:23:01] left left and we were now
[1:23:05] defeated and so one of those days um you
[1:23:08] know I went to Ethiopia for a
[1:23:12] mission and I was with brother Paul in
[1:23:15] that
[1:23:16] room and you know I put on a seron that
[1:23:19] had preached in Zimbabwe some 2011
[1:23:24] and the sermon title was
[1:23:27] desperation and within that
[1:23:29] sermon I read a quote of of brother
[1:23:33] Bram which say that some of you who stay
[1:23:36] at home and watch who love Susie instead
[1:23:38] of going to
[1:23:44] church and and so he says if I find that
[1:23:49] thing shoot it with my shortgun
[1:23:55] when I heard those
[1:23:56] words and I began preaching to these
[1:24:00] people then in 2011 I was preaching to
[1:24:03] those
[1:24:05] people but in 2015 this voice was
[1:24:08] preaching to me
[1:24:10] now as I was listening on my
[1:24:15] computer Brethren I could not sleep that
[1:24:19] night I could not sleep I received such
[1:24:23] a conviction
[1:24:25] such a conviction it began building
[1:24:28] building up building
[1:24:30] up
[1:24:31] cry I cried I just slept on the
[1:24:35] floor very cold but I didn't
[1:24:39] mind I remember I was a mess that
[1:24:44] night and I made up my mind in the in
[1:24:47] the place of
[1:24:48] Prayer by the way do you know did you
[1:24:51] know you make up your mind in prayer
[1:24:55] God reveals to you things in prayer and
[1:24:58] it say in prayer that you overcome the
[1:24:59] things that are overcoming
[1:25:02] you in prayer you receive Revelations of
[1:25:04] what you should do
[1:25:06] next even when your back is against the
[1:25:09] [Applause]
[1:25:11] wall and you know you don't know what to
[1:25:13] do next when you go in prayer you know
[1:25:17] God comes
[1:25:19] down prayer is not you speaking to
[1:25:23] God a
[1:25:26] conversation you speaking to God God
[1:25:29] speaking back amen you may think it is a
[1:25:34] thought watch your thoughts when you're
[1:25:36] in
[1:25:39] prayer God speaks to
[1:25:41] you at that time of
[1:25:44] prayer amen and so always listen to that
[1:25:48] he gives you an
[1:25:50] inspiration and then you come out
[1:25:52] knowing what you're supposed to do
[1:25:56] and so at that time God spoke to me
[1:25:59] directly he said go remove that
[1:26:04] zuku and sell it
[1:26:06] off and so I I came out I said now how
[1:26:10] will I convince my
[1:26:12] wife because I convinced her to get it
[1:26:15] how will I unconvince
[1:26:17] her when I arrived at
[1:26:20] home my wife was already also having her
[1:26:23] own experience
[1:26:27] that is why you should always marry a
[1:26:31] Believer if you Mar a
[1:26:33] Believer you have done a very good thing
[1:26:37] because God will always speak to you and
[1:26:38] speak to her at the same
[1:26:40] time hallelujah amen you will always be
[1:26:44] in
[1:26:45] agreement even when you're in
[1:26:48] disagreement prayer will bring you back
[1:26:50] again
[1:26:51] together prayer
[1:26:55] and so I found out that she had also
[1:26:57] heard from the
[1:27:00] Lord and you know God has spoken to them
[1:27:04] to switch off
[1:27:07] everything and so she did not know what
[1:27:09] to tell me when I come
[1:27:14] back she was wondering how will I
[1:27:16] convince
[1:27:19] him oh my God is good Brethren amen
[1:27:23] hallelujah amen Oneness in marriage
[1:27:26] comes from the Holy
[1:27:29] Ghost it does not come from trying and
[1:27:32] fighting and hustling com from
[1:27:36] God can you say amen hallelujah praise
[1:27:40] the Lord amen and so when I told her my
[1:27:43] my my side of the
[1:27:46] story she just
[1:27:48] laughed and called her a
[1:27:51] sister because they were together when
[1:27:53] God spoke to them
[1:27:56] and so said isn't it what God told us
[1:27:59] also they told me their
[1:28:01] story so while we were singing and
[1:28:04] rejoicing we removed the zuku and sold
[1:28:06] it
[1:28:08] off and ever since then our family has
[1:28:12] been free from
[1:28:15] that but you see when I was
[1:28:19] repenting it was out of my heart with
[1:28:22] bit tears
[1:28:25] amen that's how repentance is and then
[1:28:28] now when you truly
[1:28:29] repent and then you are baptized in
[1:28:33] water in the right
[1:28:36] way in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:39] Christ in much water do you know what
[1:28:44] Breen God is bound to do two
[1:28:47] things to wash all your sins
[1:28:51] away and fill you with the baptism of
[1:28:53] the
[1:28:56] amen amen praise the Lord amen and many
[1:29:00] times people who truly
[1:29:03] repent they receive the baptism of the
[1:29:05] Holy Spirit
[1:29:07] right right at that baptism
[1:29:10] service amen hallelujah amen praise the
[1:29:13] name of the Lord amen Brothers when I'm
[1:29:16] almost out of time you just raise up
[1:29:17] your hand and show me I just want
[1:29:21] to um read for you something here
[1:29:26] the scrip in the message the
[1:29:29] supernatural now notice you can't make
[1:29:31] yourself anything different from what
[1:29:33] God intended you to
[1:29:37] be anything else is an
[1:29:42] impersonation therefore if your
[1:29:44] conversion is only because you're trying
[1:29:47] to hide behind
[1:29:51] something or trying to make yourself a
[1:29:53] better person
[1:29:56] you are only playing the part of a
[1:30:00] hypocrite conversion is not you
[1:30:04] trying to be a better person there is a
[1:30:08] power that power is called the holy
[1:30:12] spirit amen am when you believe it and
[1:30:17] you desire
[1:30:18] it after truly
[1:30:21] repenting God brings that power
[1:30:25] and when it comes it hits
[1:30:28] you are you hearing me church that power
[1:30:31] hits
[1:30:32] you and when the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:35] hits
[1:30:36] you from that
[1:30:38] moment you don't need to be a
[1:30:41] hypocrite you will live
[1:30:45] naturally amen until Christ has actually
[1:30:49] come to your life
[1:30:54] and changed
[1:30:55] you amen and brought you into an
[1:31:02] atmosphere that's the difference of it
[1:31:05] that's the reason we go through so many
[1:31:07] different
[1:31:09] forms and saying they have to do this
[1:31:11] they have to do
[1:31:13] this Jesus said he that Hearth my
[1:31:17] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:31:21] has everlasting
[1:31:22] life not I make
[1:31:25] believe it is absolutely something that
[1:31:28] has
[1:31:31] happened a conversion of the
[1:31:34] heart that has changed
[1:31:40] you changed you and brought you into
[1:31:43] another
[1:31:47] real amen now you begin to see someone
[1:31:51] walking but they're walking in another
[1:31:53] real
[1:31:55] their mind is
[1:31:56] different their thoughts are different
[1:31:59] their appetites are
[1:32:03] different they used to CRA
[1:32:06] alcohol now the smell of alcohol makes
[1:32:09] them
[1:32:11] vomit amen when they see you know these
[1:32:15] things that were attracting
[1:32:17] them before it would pull them as if
[1:32:20] they had a rope in there
[1:32:24] but now when the Holy Spirit comes you
[1:32:28] know they walk away from
[1:32:30] him the power to walk
[1:32:33] away from your
[1:32:35] Temptations amen comes from the Holy
[1:32:38] Spirit it doesn't come from you
[1:32:42] trying it comes from
[1:32:45] God you are in another
[1:32:48] room you in another
[1:32:50] world you are walking in Heavenly places
[1:32:55] amen men are
[1:32:59] misunderstood no no no no when you when
[1:33:01] you walk in that
[1:33:03] realm you are misunderstood Christians
[1:33:06] women men
[1:33:10] boys they
[1:33:13] misunderstood who lived in those
[1:33:16] places because it is contrary to the
[1:33:19] Natural run of life
[1:33:24] among the people in the
[1:33:27] world and I am sure we all want to live
[1:33:31] in that
[1:33:32] atmosphere how many want to live in that
[1:33:36] atmosph now before you've received the
[1:33:39] Holy
[1:33:40] Ghost you are believing unto eternal
[1:33:47] life but you do not have etal
[1:33:52] life until you receive the Holy
[1:33:56] Ghost this is from questions and answers
[1:33:59] now because the holy spirit is eternal
[1:34:04] life the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:07] God God is life in
[1:34:10] you then you've got eternal
[1:34:13] life do you understand that now see look
[1:34:17] you are believing
[1:34:19] unto you believed the message but you're
[1:34:21] believing unto
[1:34:24] you believed in baptism in Jesus but
[1:34:25] you're
[1:34:28] believing until you are filled with the
[1:34:30] Holy
[1:34:32] Ghost praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:34:35] and any doctor will tell you if you put
[1:34:36] something on the outside and heal the
[1:34:43] sound it will only make it worse
[1:34:55] it has to heal from the
[1:34:57] inside and that's the way Christianity
[1:35:00] is it isn't joining church or something
[1:35:04] it is healing from the
[1:35:07] inside coming out your conversion comes
[1:35:11] from the
[1:35:16] inside the
[1:35:18] cor
[1:35:20] Spirit
[1:35:22] life amen
[1:35:25] hallelujah amen what was the Holy Ghost
[1:35:27] given
[1:35:29] for you believe unto him when you accept
[1:35:32] him as your personal
[1:35:34] savior but when God
[1:35:36] gives but when God gives you the Seal of
[1:35:39] the Holy
[1:35:40] Ghost he sealed you to your Eternal
[1:35:44] destination now you this that and I will
[1:35:48] go with you on into eternal
[1:35:52] security yes sir because grieve not the
[1:35:55] Holy Ghost okay I don't know how to
[1:35:57] explain it just follow what I'm saying
[1:35:59] and follow connect to the spirit listen
[1:36:00] it says grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:36:04] God whereby you are sealed until the day
[1:36:06] of your
[1:36:08] Redemption you are not sealed by
[1:36:10] believing
[1:36:14] unto but sealed by the Holy
[1:36:18] Ghost the Holy Ghost seals
[1:36:21] you when you found favor with
[1:36:25] God and he seals you by the holy
[1:36:31] spirit that is so for the Bible say no
[1:36:34] man can call Jesus Christ only by the
[1:36:37] Holy
[1:36:40] Ghost you say I believe it it because
[1:36:43] the Pastor said
[1:36:45] so he's right but that doesn't count for
[1:36:50] you I believe it because the word says
[1:36:52] so
[1:36:55] yes that's right but that isn't for you
[1:37:00] that doesn't count for you the only way
[1:37:03] that you can say that Jesus is the
[1:37:06] Christ is when the Holy Ghost
[1:37:09] comes into you and bear
[1:37:15] record and Witnesses itself
[1:37:22] out is the Son of
[1:37:25] God Amen that's the only way you know
[1:37:27] the
[1:37:28] resurrection is when the Holy Ghost
[1:37:30] Bears
[1:37:32] Rec when the Holy Ghost is
[1:37:35] come he will
[1:37:39] testify of
[1:37:41] me he will show
[1:37:44] you things to
[1:37:46] come you will bring these things that I
[1:37:49] say to your
[1:37:52] memories you will never find it in the
[1:37:54] school he will bring those things to
[1:37:57] your
[1:38:00] memories so Peter had been
[1:38:03] saved he believed on the
[1:38:05] Lord he followed him Jesus told him who
[1:38:10] he
[1:38:11] was had him to follow him he gave him
[1:38:15] power against unclean spirits
[1:38:18] and and he Sanctified him but after all
[1:38:23] of
[1:38:25] and become the chief spokesman he became
[1:38:27] like the
[1:38:30] pope Catholics call him the
[1:38:33] pope whatever it was he became the head
[1:38:37] of the
[1:38:38] church yet Jesus
[1:38:40] said the night of his
[1:38:45] betrayal she asked
[1:38:47] Peter lovest thou me
[1:38:49] Peter and he said Lord you know I love
[1:38:52] you
[1:38:53] said feed my sheep he said that three
[1:38:57] times and Peter said you know I love
[1:39:00] you will go with you to the end and I'll
[1:39:04] go with you to the
[1:39:06] death this is a genuine brother but
[1:39:08] without the Holy
[1:39:12] Ghost
[1:39:13] amen he said before the C cow three
[1:39:18] times you will have denied me three
[1:39:22] times but have prayed for
[1:39:25] you that's one thing I wanted to show
[1:39:27] you
[1:39:28] tonight if you are a genuine believer of
[1:39:31] the
[1:39:32] world Jesus prayed for
[1:39:36] you in your process before
[1:39:39] you baptized into the Holy
[1:39:43] Spirit the devil's desire to have
[1:39:46] you you like we but they cannot have you
[1:39:54] amen Peter I prayed for you listen
[1:39:57] that's not all of it I prayed for you
[1:40:00] and after you are
[1:40:04] converted then strengthen your
[1:40:07] brethren after you are
[1:40:09] converted he had
[1:40:11] shouted after you you are
[1:40:15] converted he had probably danced in the
[1:40:18] spirit he he had done all these kind of
[1:40:21] things but he he hadn't received the
[1:40:24] holy spirit
[1:40:26] yet after you are
[1:40:28] converted then the then strengthen your
[1:40:33] brethren carry out his
[1:40:36] plan praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:40:39] and I want to finish with a M with a
[1:40:41] quote from the questions and
[1:40:44] answers it's a question that was asked
[1:40:46] by the
[1:40:47] prophet is it true that you are not
[1:40:49] saved unless you have received the Holy
[1:40:51] Ghost
[1:41:00] you not saved until you have received
[1:41:02] the Holy
[1:41:06] Ghost there could take about I could
[1:41:08] take about an hour discussion on
[1:41:11] that when you accept Christ as your
[1:41:14] savior and you are then ready for
[1:41:16] baptism in
[1:41:19] water you have not yet been converted
[1:41:25] you are only believing
[1:41:29] un conversion means to be
[1:41:33] changed now now to make this
[1:41:37] efficient Jesus said to Peter who had
[1:41:40] also followed him for three and a half
[1:41:43] years in the in the Book of Matthew the
[1:41:46] 10th chapter Jesus gave
[1:41:50] Peter I want you to explain this to the
[1:41:52] people properly you see he gave he G he
[1:41:54] gave people power he gave Peter
[1:41:57] power against unclean
[1:41:59] spirits to go out to cast them out to
[1:42:04] the sick to preach the gospel this was
[1:42:08] before the Holy
[1:42:11] Ghost so people can do all these things
[1:42:14] before my good
[1:42:19] Lord cast out demons heal the sick
[1:42:23] preach the
[1:42:26] gospel against
[1:42:29] Spirits before they are filled with the
[1:42:32] Holy
[1:42:34] Ghost that's why he
[1:42:37] say gifts the gifts and the calling of
[1:42:42] God I without
[1:42:45] repentance but I will tell you
[1:42:48] Brethren the Holy Ghost cannot be
[1:42:50] received without repentance
[1:42:56] that is why if you want to see someone
[1:42:58] who's truly
[1:43:01] converted amen the things they used to
[1:43:03] do they will no longer do them
[1:43:07] again he had power to do this and and
[1:43:10] you know Jesus Sanctified Peter through
[1:43:12] the
[1:43:13] [Applause]
[1:43:14] truth Peter had already gone through
[1:43:18] justification had gone through
[1:43:20] sanctification
[1:43:25] but Peter was not yet
[1:43:27] filled say the word was the truth and he
[1:43:30] was the
[1:43:32] word and then before
[1:43:36] Pentecost he said after you were
[1:43:41] converted after you
[1:43:46] Peter then strengthen your
[1:43:49] brethren you are only taking steps
[1:43:54] to
[1:43:56] conversion as you
[1:43:58] believe and are
[1:44:02] acting now I know many of you my Baptist
[1:44:04] and Presbyterian friends disagree
[1:44:08] with these days even some message
[1:44:11] Believers are falling in that
[1:44:14] category they don't believe that someone
[1:44:16] has to receive an
[1:44:21] experience brother sister
[1:44:24] you should receive an experience each of
[1:44:28] us you should receive an
[1:44:32] experience until then you are not
[1:44:37] converted you can be a good brother in
[1:44:39] the church a good
[1:44:41] church but when even you have some gifts
[1:44:44] by the
[1:44:45] way it is possible but when your
[1:44:49] life is testifying something else
[1:44:53] you can even
[1:44:55] preach but when your life has not yet
[1:44:58] been
[1:44:59] converted and each of
[1:45:02] us needs that
[1:45:06] conversion each of us need the power of
[1:45:10] the Holy
[1:45:11] Ghost to come in our
[1:45:14] souls have an experience with God then
[1:45:17] we are candidates for the
[1:45:21] Rapture then we shall overcome the
[1:45:23] things which are overcoming
[1:45:27] us amen praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:45:31] hallelujah amen I think my time for the
[1:45:34] for the for the zoom is
[1:45:36] over and allow me a moment to pray for
[1:45:38] the Saints on Zoom father in the name of
[1:45:40] Jesus i' would like to thank you Lord
[1:45:42] for the
[1:45:43] moment that you have given to us to
[1:45:45] share with the Saints
[1:45:48] evening bless each one of them Father
[1:45:51] and Lord if there be anyone Lord has
[1:45:53] been seeking for that
[1:45:55] experience that true
[1:45:58] conversion Grant it to them Lord because
[1:46:01] you a living God father Lord do anyone
[1:46:04] under the sound of my voice who desires
[1:46:07] that in their heart may you grant it to
[1:46:10] them in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:46:13] Christ amen amen amen God bless you
[1:46:16] Saints on
[1:46:18] Zoom now friends I'll tell you
[1:46:21] this this tonight is a
[1:46:24] teaching and that's why you should allow
[1:46:26] me a few minutes I I I conclude with
[1:46:28] this
[1:46:30] quote because I want I may not go back
[1:46:33] to this this
[1:46:35] way you see let me let me continue here
[1:46:38] just a few moments it says you see you
[1:46:40] go back to the
[1:46:42] scripture Abraham in Romans 4 believed
[1:46:46] God and it was imputed unto him for
[1:46:50] righteousness
[1:46:52] he believed God was imputed unto him for
[1:46:56] righteousness Abraham believed God and
[1:46:58] God imputed it to him for
[1:47:02] righteousness upon the basis of his
[1:47:04] faith to
[1:47:09] believe but to prove to
[1:47:14] Abraham because see what the argument
[1:47:17] bam is bringing
[1:47:19] here people are
[1:47:21] saying Abraham did not do anything
[1:47:23] Abraham only believed
[1:47:27] God right but you see the prophet
[1:47:31] continues and
[1:47:32] says after Abraham believed
[1:47:36] God God gave go went ahead and gave him
[1:47:39] a
[1:47:41] sign he gave him a
[1:47:44] sign and that's the sign of the Holy
[1:47:47] Ghost the Seal of
[1:47:50] God and there is where you are my dear
[1:47:53] Presbyterian and Baptist
[1:47:55] friends you failed to see
[1:47:59] it he gave him the Seal of
[1:48:03] circumcision as a
[1:48:05] witness as a
[1:48:07] proof that he had received his faith in
[1:48:11] him and that's why Paul in Acts
[1:48:16] 19 he said to those Baptist
[1:48:20] Brethren who had app as their
[1:48:24] Pastor believe in the Gospel of John he
[1:48:27] had preached
[1:48:30] it you ask them have you received the
[1:48:33] Holy
[1:48:34] Ghost since you
[1:48:37] believe you see they had
[1:48:40] believed but had not yet been
[1:48:45] converted now we take the wrong uh word
[1:48:48] conversion today
[1:48:55] we say that a man that's converted is a
[1:48:58] man that stopped
[1:49:04] drinking this is a good corner here now
[1:49:06] we are
[1:49:07] taking we think it's a man who has
[1:49:09] stopped
[1:49:11] drinking and everything and goes to the
[1:49:14] church joins the church he might join
[1:49:17] the
[1:49:18] church but that's no sign he's converted
[1:49:24] he isn't converted until listen the old
[1:49:28] life is
[1:49:33] dead are you hearing me
[1:49:36] Church your old
[1:49:39] life I don't always look at you like
[1:49:43] this but allow me to do it
[1:49:46] today because if this doesn't happen
[1:49:49] then all preaching is for nothing
[1:49:53] your old
[1:49:54] life has to
[1:49:57] die if you had
[1:50:00] hatred that has to
[1:50:03] die if you are an immortal
[1:50:07] person there is no other
[1:50:10] way try to P
[1:50:14] yourself know how you
[1:50:16] are to
[1:50:20] die if he doesn't die
[1:50:23] you are not yet
[1:50:26] converted you are not filled with the
[1:50:28] Holy
[1:50:29] Ghost you are
[1:50:34] still you have not
[1:50:37] overcome you
[1:50:42] cannot you cannot make it to the
[1:50:45] Rapture you cannot I'll be deceiving you
[1:50:49] if I tell you you will
[1:50:54] that old life has to
[1:50:58] die how can you claim you are a Rapture
[1:51:01] you know candidate when you are still
[1:51:03] living in
[1:51:08] fornication you
[1:51:10] cannot you are still telling
[1:51:13] lies goodness
[1:51:16] lies you are living in your old
[1:51:21] life you not yet been
[1:51:25] converted you see you still have FS of
[1:51:32] anger you you you you still
[1:51:36] Abus The Works of the flesh are still
[1:51:38] living in
[1:51:40] you and you are not yet
[1:51:44] converted you you you you still have
[1:51:49] conciousness you know when someone you
[1:51:52] you always you
[1:51:54] want that don't belong to
[1:51:57] you you are not yet
[1:52:00] converted I am not condemning you I am
[1:52:03] showing you your
[1:52:06] condition when you see it you say oh
[1:52:09] God I need a conversion you
[1:52:13] know and now let me tell you to
[1:52:19] repentance will give you the Holy Ghost
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:24] amen before you
[1:52:27] repent don't even try to ask for the
[1:52:29] Holy
[1:52:31] Ghost because you will never receive
[1:52:34] him he comes in a cleaned up
[1:52:39] house he comes in a ready
[1:52:44] Vel he comes in a soul that is hungering
[1:52:48] and thirsting
[1:52:54] the Bible says blessed are
[1:52:59] they after
[1:53:01] righteousness for they shall be
[1:53:08] filled he's not talking about mere
[1:53:13] fasting no he's talking about a
[1:53:17] soul that is
[1:53:19] repented and hungering for God
[1:53:26] amen praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:53:30] you see he isn't converted until the old
[1:53:33] life is
[1:53:40] dead and he is buried in
[1:53:43] Christ and he is risen with him in the
[1:53:46] resurrection of newness of
[1:53:50] life when the Holy Spirit
[1:53:53] has created in him a Living Hope of
[1:53:55] eternal
[1:54:00] life that only comes through the Holy
[1:54:03] Ghost
[1:54:05] therefore the question is that a man is
[1:54:09] saved I
[1:54:12] believe if he is trying to look towards
[1:54:16] to
[1:54:20] calary and dies in that
[1:54:27] EST because people who debate how about
[1:54:30] those who like the thief on the cross he
[1:54:32] did not have that
[1:54:36] experience but you see he died looking
[1:54:38] towards
[1:54:40] Calvary he died in that
[1:54:43] estate says in that case that man is
[1:54:48] saved certainly I believe he will be sa
[1:54:52] he would go through if he had not the
[1:54:55] opportunity
[1:54:59] before you go back to the dying Thief at
[1:55:02] the
[1:55:03] cross but remember that that was his
[1:55:06] first and last
[1:55:11] chance you got one
[1:55:14] tonight don't wait till that
[1:55:19] time because it might not be that way
[1:55:22] with
[1:55:26] you that girl you playing around
[1:55:30] with that boy you may not have a chance
[1:55:33] like the thief
[1:55:39] on you might not have a deathbed
[1:55:47] confession you see I tell you that we
[1:55:51] have very many living like
[1:55:55] that
[1:56:01] believer I tell you they all right but
[1:56:03] you see there there are too much of a
[1:56:05] chance to take a chance
[1:56:09] on don't take a
[1:56:15] chance don't you wait for death
[1:56:18] [Applause]
[1:56:20] bed you let this
[1:56:22] let this be tonight right now your death
[1:56:29] [Applause]
[1:56:31] B that you die
[1:56:34] out
[1:56:36] now and be born again of the Holy
[1:56:41] Spirit listen it does not take a full
[1:56:46] week the longest it took in the Bible
[1:56:49] was seven days
[1:56:53] number okay the longest time it has ever
[1:56:56] taken for people to be filled with the
[1:56:57] Holy Ghost was seven
[1:57:02] days and they were waiting in the upper
[1:57:05] room that's the longest
[1:57:07] time how about you saying I've been
[1:57:09] waiting for
[1:57:12] years God has been waiting on
[1:57:15] you he's more willing to fill
[1:57:18] you but you are not repented you are not
[1:57:21] ready
[1:57:23] you you are still living in
[1:57:26] hypocrisy I believe after hearing these
[1:57:29] words every one of you if you truly
[1:57:34] believe you ought to leave this do
[1:57:38] today after saying I've been filled with
[1:57:40] the Holy
[1:57:43] Ghost why because it's saying right now
[1:57:47] now you can be born again
[1:57:50] now of the Holy
[1:57:52] Spirit can you receive the Holy Spirit
[1:57:54] like that yes it is very easy to receive
[1:57:59] the Holy
[1:58:00] Spirit if you repent of all your
[1:58:04] hypocrisy and you clean up your heart
[1:58:07] with if you don't if you don't receive
[1:58:10] the Holy
[1:58:11] Spirit check that
[1:58:15] area of your
[1:58:18] repentance are you right with
[1:58:20] God are you right with with God if you
[1:58:24] truly
[1:58:25] are there's no reason why he
[1:58:30] cannot amen
[1:58:34] amen now that's where the preacher does
[1:58:36] his
[1:58:38] job and he
[1:58:41] finishes the rest is
[1:58:44] yours amen because I cannot ask the Holy
[1:58:47] Spirit on your behalf
[1:58:54] that's why some
[1:58:55] Believers when that Revelation strikes
[1:58:59] you even shut off
[1:59:01] everything and let me go and seek the
[1:59:06] holy not because he can't give it to you
[1:59:08] where you
[1:59:09] are because you want to have a time of
[1:59:16] consecration a time where you will put
[1:59:19] yourself
[1:59:20] right and you that I am right every area
[1:59:27] is that's why Believers go in fasting
[1:59:30] and prayer praying for God to fill them
[1:59:32] with the Holy
[1:59:34] Ghost but you see you can receive the
[1:59:36] prayer the holy ghost in a prayer
[1:59:39] line you can receive the Holy Ghost when
[1:59:41] the preacher is still
[1:59:43] preaching you can receive the Holy Ghost
[1:59:45] you know we've seen all these things
[1:59:48] happen when you prayed for during your
[1:59:51] water baptism
[1:59:54] I mean God will fulfill
[1:59:55] his as long as your part is done
