[32:47] [Music]
[32:52] how many appreciate the presence of god
[33:30] [Music]
[33:36] once
[33:46] again he limited a certain day saying in
[33:48] david today after so long a time as it
[33:51] said today if you will hear his voice
[33:54] having not your hearts for if jesus had
[33:57] given them rest then would he not after
[33:59] what have spoken of another day
[34:25] for the people of god
[34:27] for he that is entered into his rest he
[34:30] also has uh seized from his own words
[34:36] as god did from years
[34:39] verse
[34:42] 8
[35:07] [Music]
[35:23] [Music]
[35:27] the holy spirit
[35:41] then the same day at evening being the
[35:43] first day of the week when the doors
[35:45] were shut where the disciples where the
[35:48] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[35:50] jews came jesus and stood in the midst
[35:53] and saith unto them peace be unto you
[35:55] and when he had so said he showed unto
[35:58] them his hands and his side and then
[36:01] where the disciples glad when they saw
[36:03] the lord then said jesus to them again
[36:05] peace be unto you as my father has sent
[36:08] me even so send are you and when he
[36:10] associate this he breathed on them and
[36:12] said unto them receive ye the holy ghost
[36:14] whosoever sins you remember they are
[36:16] admitted unto them and also ever since
[36:18] he retained they are retained
[36:25] [Music]
[37:03] [Music]
[37:17] amen i mean amen sing this with me other
[37:20] cross at the cross
[37:24] where i fought saw the light
[37:28] and the bird and my heart
[37:32] rolled away
[37:37] it was there
[37:39] by
[37:40] faith
[37:42] i
[37:43] received my son
[37:47] and now
[37:48] [Music]
[38:15] why jesus christ died on the cross
[38:20] so that we might be able to receive the
[38:21] holy spirit in our souls
[38:25] we were born in a way that was perverted
[38:29] and if we die without a change taking
[38:32] place in our souls
[38:36] there is no more sacrifice for sin
[38:38] foreign
[38:39] [Music]
[38:51] is actually
[38:52] within
[38:54] the uh
[38:56] within the word almost
[38:59] you see when you receive the word whoa
[39:02] actually receive the blood
[39:04] and when you reject the word
[39:06] you have rejected the problem
[39:10] that the life of the blood is
[39:25] to enforce the power
[39:28] [Music]
[39:39] but you have not received the holy ghost
[39:41] yet
[39:43] you have not yet received the enforcer
[39:46] today
[39:47] it is the holy spirit
[39:50] which is the enforcer yeah take some of
[39:52] them
[40:08] supposed to leave egypt and everybody
[40:10] knows so that they can go and possess
[40:12] the land back in never tourism which god
[40:15] had promised i can't even make you ever
[40:16] soon so we have been able to see
[40:18] together that before they could be able
[40:20] to attain the land that even never tried
[40:23] to see the promised land in central
[40:25] business they had to go listen to me
[40:27] they had to go through a series
[40:31] hallelujah
[40:32] of of things but you know peter moving
[40:35] into everywhere and one
[40:50] and we noticed that when they that
[40:52] before they could apply that blood
[40:56] are you following me
[40:58] there was something that was required
[41:02] hallelujah
[41:07] so there was something that was required
[41:09] why do we actually target one and
[41:12] that could not be attained
[41:16] without a messenger of the hour
[41:32] was equipped with a message
[41:35] which was going to give these people an
[41:37] hour and turn the revelation they needed
[41:39] to have it
[41:41] in order to move from the place where
[41:43] they were
[41:44] for everybody to go and attain the
[41:46] promise which god had given you never to
[41:48] add it to you
[41:51] and that messenger was moses
[41:54] and one mother came down
