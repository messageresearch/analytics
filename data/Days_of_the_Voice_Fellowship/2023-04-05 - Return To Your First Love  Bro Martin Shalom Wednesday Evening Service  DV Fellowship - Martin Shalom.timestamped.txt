[24:50] is commanding them to go back to their
[24:53] first love
[24:54] [Applause]
[24:56] he said repent
[24:59] and go back the first line
[25:02] blessed me the name of the Lord amen
[25:07] remember the first love that was Christ
[25:09] himself
[25:12] because Love Is God
[25:16] if you look at the book of Acts
[25:22] amen how they loved serving God
[25:27] the Bible says they could they used to
[25:30] gather they gathered on daily basis
[25:34] praise be to God and God and somehow
[25:39] these people relaxed
[25:44] amen man and God came down
[25:48] and it's reminding them
[25:50] where they have relaxed from
[25:54] and it's telling them here
[25:57] go back to your first love
[26:01] blessed with the name of the Lord and
[26:04] the prophet tells us that the book of
[26:07] Acts it is taking
[26:13] us back to that church
[26:17] and that is the church which is going to
[26:20] be ruptured
[26:22] the church
[26:24] were exposed
[26:29] where sin could not hide in the church
[26:34] blessed be the name of the Lord

[27:27] out the things we used to do for God
[27:32] and we are no longer doing them
[27:35] praise be to God come here when we used
[27:38] to pray many times a day
[27:42] and nowadays we are so busy
[27:48] you are think of this that that rules
[27:52] when we used to come early at church
[27:56] and we kneel before the altar time
[28:01] before God
[28:03] he says repent
[28:09] amen
[28:11] it's the rebuking
[28:15] kind of preaching
[28:20] blessed in the name of the Lord
[28:22] we must know where
[28:24] we have fallen from today
[28:28] where we have relaxed what were two more
[28:31] day praise be to God because where we
[28:34] have read in Matthew
[28:37] Jesus says
[28:46] we must endure Until the End
[28:50] Community
[28:54] meaning things want to be easy
[28:59] because if things are okay you can bear
[29:03] [Applause]
[29:05] you can easily endure good things praise
[29:09] you to God Amen
[29:15] but it means there are some other things
[29:18] that must happen
[29:20] when you look at the context of our
[29:24] patience
[29:26] most times
[29:29] what you are being patient
[29:32] is not easy amen man
[29:40] I've been so patient with be having a
[29:43] lot of money
[29:46] um
[29:56] but most time you hear people say
[30:00] I've been patient about this
[30:04] right now I can no longer make it but
[30:07] Jesus
[30:13] is the one that shall be saved praise
[30:16] the Lord man
[30:36] it's knowing what is right
[30:40] and we don't do it
[30:43] foreign
[30:50] what is right to do ag2 for children
[30:52] what you're supposed to do
[30:55] blessed be the name of the Lord
[30:58] amen amen but in Revelation
[31:02] he tells us to repent uh
[31:08] remember there are four ways Thou Art
[31:11] fallen
[31:13] and repent
[31:17] amen amen
[31:24] and do the fast works okay
[31:31] we know those first Works
[31:33] [Applause]
[31:35] desire to please God okay
[31:41] to live a righteous life
[31:44] amen that is the first work
[32:01] amen I remember when I just believed
[32:06] all of us we have that point
[32:10] if it was genuine encounter with the
[32:13] Lord
[32:16] where you could spend the whole night in
[32:19] prayer
[32:21] amen when you hardly sleep without
[32:24] praying
[32:27] you first three times and we are three
[32:30] days not three times
[32:41] [Applause]
[32:52] but what happened
[32:54] what went wrong
[32:58] Hallelujah
[33:07] amen Amina
[33:11] amen Amina
[33:14] repent and say Amen
[33:19] praise be to God Amen
[33:42] out of
[33:44] he's out of his place
[33:47] except thou repent
[33:50] blessed with the name of the Lord
[33:54] amen Amina
[33:56] in this message the prophet says
[34:01] uh this is the message enticing spirits
[34:06] send the Holy Ghost with such all-time
[34:10] convictions
[34:15] that it will clean a man's appetite
[34:21] and they will lead his soul
[34:26] and clean him up
[34:29] um
[34:31] praise the Lord
[34:33] you know when the love of God is in your
[34:35] heart
[34:36] the Bible says the joy of the Lord is
[34:39] yours
[34:42] when God is happy you are strong
[34:46] amen when God is happy with you
[34:51] that is your strength
[34:54] praise the Lord man
[35:05] is the Lord happy with me
[35:08] but here the prophet is saying
[35:12] that God sent the Holy Ghost
[35:16] the whole of this message
[35:18] it's all about the Holy Spirit
[35:22] you cannot talk about the Holy Ghost
[35:25] and you put Holiness aside
[35:30] praise the Lord because when the Holy
[35:33] Spirit is in us
[35:36] our test will change
[35:39] our lives will change
[35:43] amen we will desire to walk right
[35:47] and do things right
[35:49] he will put that conviction in our
[35:52] hearts
[35:53] because Jesus said when the Holy Ghost
[35:57] will come he will conflict the world of
[36:00] sin a little meriz
[36:16] each one of us that's what we need
[36:21] the Holy Ghost is the tutor um
[36:38] praise the Lord what happened to the
[36:41] appetite you used to have
[36:46] are you still eating what you used to
[36:48] eat when you had when you you were in
[36:51] good times with the Lord
[36:54] [Music]
[36:58] he said the holy send the Holy Ghost
[37:02] with such all-time convictions
[37:09] remember this gospel
[37:11] is taking us back to Zion you're a Faith
[37:15] of Our Fathers
[37:17] amen the friends of the prophets
[37:24] amen when man had conviction
[37:30] where they had conviction in their
[37:32] hearts
[37:34] until the Bible says not even people
[37:38] fear to join their Church
[37:43] praise the Lord
[37:47] so this word
[37:48] they reveal the word of the hour
[37:51] is restoring Us
[37:57] Praise me to God
[38:02] killing man's appetite and clean his
[38:04] soul
[38:07] and clean him up
[38:10] and make him heaven-bound creatures
[38:17] amen most of the things binding us
[38:23] they are not heaven they are not
[38:26] Heavenly gurus
[38:29] they are absolute things because the
[38:33] devil knows when he hip on us
[38:36] [Music]
[38:43] blessed with the name of the Lord amen
[38:45] but he say you must come under
[38:47] conviction in the message
[38:51] God sent us all the fashion Pentecostal
[38:55] Holy Ghost Revival cartoon
[39:00] that will bring sin
[39:12] praise the Lord
[39:16] when we are restored back we're to
[39:20] discipline you when God returned us back
[39:24] to that first love
[39:28] that's what love will bring conviction
[39:30] in our hearts
[39:35] it will increase our appetite for God
[39:41] praise be to God because that love is
[39:45] God himself
[39:47] and when the love of God is in us
[39:52] we are going to seek on things where
[39:54] Christ is on the right hand of God
[39:56] together
[40:01] before even we think about the rapture
[40:05] we must return
[40:07] before we talk about the Rapture
[40:11] I will restored but this is
[40:14] not only restored by the word word and
[40:17] word
[40:20] but we must be restored even in the
[40:23] power of God
[40:29] Amen that is the true restoration
[40:34] because say whatever it was eaten by
[40:37] kangaroo caterpillar in the Book of Joel
[40:40] he said he will restore it back
[40:47] but here in Matthew chapter 24 verses
[40:50] 12.
[40:51] he says because iniquity
[40:58] iniquity shall abound the love of man
[41:01] foreign
[41:15] the love of many has worked
[41:19] I think some have reached a point
[41:23] and I think I think the Lord has delayed
[41:26] to come on
[41:29] but remember
[41:31] the Bible tells us
[41:35] concerning his promises
[41:43] blessed with the name of the Lord
[41:46] amen
[41:49] the grain should mature with the light
[41:57] but the thing but the thing
[42:01] is today
[42:04] the church grain don't want to mature
[42:10] if you want to stay the way it was back
[42:17] but this is another hour
[42:20] this is another day friend
[42:23] this is
[42:24] [Applause]
[42:32] amen things are running very fast
[42:39] it is another Edge
[42:43] where God is doing uh he's doing a very
[42:47] is doing it so quick to finish his work
[42:54] but what place are you running
[43:00] blessed in the name of the Lord
[43:03] amen I mean this First Love Is the Love
[43:07] of the groom and the bride
[43:11] the groom is complaining
[43:20] amen the first love you had
[43:23] just like to love your heart for your
[43:25] wife
[43:27] when you are proposing to her
[43:37] say that
[43:39] um
[43:50] [Music]
[44:13] amen amen even God wants us back the
[44:17] first night
[44:20] we are the bride the Instagram
[44:23] and the groom is asking himself the same
[44:26] way
[44:36] praise be to God
[44:40] but the Bible says
[44:50] praise be to God
[44:53] and the rapture
[44:55] foreign
[45:41] to multiply like three times that the
[45:46] day like then
[45:47] the way we used to eat when he had just
[45:49] believed
[45:54] because even the Bible tells us the
[45:57] Bible is
[45:58] that
[46:02] in the song Amazing Grace
[46:12] there is near than when we first
[46:16] believed
[46:17] blessed with the name of the Lord Amina
[46:20] you must come under conviction
[46:24] you know when the love of God when the
[46:27] love of mother works when iniquity
