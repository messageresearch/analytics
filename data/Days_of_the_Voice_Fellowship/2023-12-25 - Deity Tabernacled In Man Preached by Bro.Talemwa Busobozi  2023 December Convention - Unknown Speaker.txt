God and we have the same Spirit we have a what we call a kindred spirit and you see we are not the only ones there are others like us all over the world and if we were to meet in a an auditorium all

Chapter 2:8 thank you musicians Luke chapter [Music] 2 verse verse 8 praise God I I will read um can you are you you able to read it in maybe or I read in English maybe I can read in English and then you can read in your Bible inah if you have and there and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good hidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and and and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the Babe wrapped in the in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God hallelujah amen praising God saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord has made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known they made know abroad a saying which was told them concerning this child and all they had and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God glorifying I love that part glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen for all the things they had heard and seen as it was told unto them praise the name of the Lord for [Music] [Music] Mal [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen you may be seated I'd like to uh bring greetings from our church in campala days of the voice Fellowship the Saints there sent their greetings and number 12 is not a bad representation WE 12 years from there am amen how many happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen as I was meditating last night about the birth of Jesus the world has um you know the world has um masses uh instead of uh a service like we have in commemoration of his birth we are so happy that we are not only thinking about the Messiah that was born 2,000 years ago we want to see him born in our hearts this morning and so as I was meditating last night I heard those words and you know it just echoed in my ears Tabernacle in man Tabernacle in man and so I wondered how that is connected to the birth of Jesus and so started to pray and study over it and so I want to show you a few things that God revealed to me and I trust it will be a blessing to you if God gave it to me I believe it is for someone here this morning do you have a need that that you brought before the Lord how many prayed last night so God is going to answer your need so if you are expecting I believe you're going to receive tell your neighbor you going to receive now I want to show you that it all started in heaven all started in heaven and then from Heaven came down into the garden of the devil thought he would defeat God you know as the Bible says in the Book of Revelation it says there was war In Heaven There was war in heaven Michael fought against the dragon with his fallen angels and Michael also fought with his angels and Michael was representing God and I don't even know how the devil was thinking to think that he can defeat the the war he can defeat God in his presence he is doing the same mistake today to think that he can defeat the children of God in the presence of God it is not possible for Satan to defeat the armies of the Living God because the Bible says God is the Lord of hosts he is mighty in battle he is not weak the god of love he's the god of love but he does not mean he he loves only and he does not make war oh no he he loves but he also is a god of war and when he makes War he always stands out to be the mighty conqueror you know when a country declares War another country you do not know who will win but when God declares war you 100% sure he's going to win that war because he the Lord of H Mighty in battle and I want to say that is our God and he is when when you when you're going to make war you don't just go and fight you have to have a strategy how you are going to defeat your enemy you have to have a plan and God is a master strategist before even the devil thought it about defeating about fighting and you know taking over before it crossed the mind of Satan at that time he was an angel and his name was Lucifer before Lucifer thought about opposing God had already seen it God had already put a plan in place are you not glad that you serve that kind of God is a master strategist God had seen the end right at the beginning Hallelujah he had seen the end right at the beginning and he had he had it all planned out he had known every move Satan will make and he had known how he will combat it but also the devil had a plan his plan was I will Ascend above the stars of God and I will become God himself that was plan a of Satan but remember because Satan is not God he could not have only one plan he had more than one plan because he was not too sure plan will work out so plan a I will Ascend above the stars of God and I will become God but if that fails he I have plan B I will go down take over the human race that was the devil's plan because thought if I fail here in heaven I canot surely fail on Earth and I know according to the way God works if I if I I fight him here and I fail he will most certainly cast me down but I have a plan when he cast me down I will take over his race on Earth I will take over the human race but if that fails I have plan C I will confuse the whole human race and I will rule over them but if that fails and if I can't do it I will then steal kill and destroy the human r was the mind of Satan plan a plan B plan C Hallelujah Hall that is Satan but let me tell you we must be sorry for him because we serve a God who doesn't need plan A B C D but I say our God has a plan and his plan is plan A and plan a cannot fail the moment God s it and he said it that settles it before it has even come to pass it has already happen in his mind already finished is a finished work God is God hallelujah my this makes me me enthused Genesis 3:15 let us see the plan of God and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this thou cast above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy B shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life we are now reading from Genesis 3:15 [Music] and I will put a between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall Breeze thy head and thou shall breathe his heel now friends I want you to see something here pleas give me your attention see that when the devil came down first of all his plan a failed tell your name but the devil's plan failed oh my the devil must be trembling right now because we are discovering him and by discovering his failures we discovering our Victory and if the devil oh my God if the devil failed in the beginning he will always fail the chances of receiving Victory are almost nonexistent he failed in heaven when his plan a failed come to the Earth as a failed spiritual being so the devil came down to us a failure and he's convincing you that you are a failure you are not the failure he is the failure he fail in the beginning he will fail today he will fail tomorrow he will never win but we have a go and his plan never F and I want to see here when he came down here he now said is he called his generals his demons I don't know who he was leading the strategy and the he called him he said let us execute Plan B let us execute Plan B Plan B is green light green light go Plan B is a goal let us begin and what was Plan B to take over the human race so he came down as he is he found a beast which was looking like a human being almost like a human being almost had a soul but never had a soul but had a place for it the devil saw that Beast Adam was somewhere in the garden the devil's plan was the devil maybe his General came and told him yes sir the plan is you are going to go and incarnate into this Beast it is exactly like Adam almost almost like you enter Then you can attack and defile the womb of Eve that way we can plant our seed in there and then we shall take over the human race ah the devil say that's a good plan he execute so now the devil came in and boom he came into the woman a beast and then came to tempt and seduce woman where was God when all this was going on a plan and God does not rush Hallelujah God does not rush because he knows how it is going to end he was there and he doesn't rush and while the devil was doing all this he was just taking a seat somewhere he was not bothered all the Angels were surprised that God was not bothered but God had a plan his plan work out and his plan need the devil to execute his plan first you have to realize friends for God to be able to move in your life sometimes he lets the devil come in first confuse you and then you get worried about things in your life about things in your life and then you get confused but let me tell you brother sister God knows all that God knows all that let it be because if it doesn't happen that way there is no way how he will do his thing for God's plan to work the devil's plan had to fa fast and soil did all that he did and and then afterward God came down his plan God's plan is as perfect as God is he knows all things and he has a winning plan tell someone God has a winning plan Hallelujah some of these words I just wrote them here by inspiration as I was studying I keep reading them for you God had a winning plan and listen No Angel no man knew Noel knew his plan his winning plan was to was STP secret the devil did not know God is next move do you know the devil does not know God's next move in your life that's one party does not know even where you are now the devil is shocked and surprised because he expected that you would have died long ago you remember the the devil La for you he expected those trops will kill you and he's surprised you have made and let me tell you tell your devil tell your devil he yet to be surprised it is just the beginning hallelujah hallelujah amen there is more coming did expect me to be here today he expected you to be dead in religion dead in sin but God winning plan and the devil never knew anything about it hallelujah hallelujah oh glory god the plan of God was that God himself would beab in man to appro and to destroy the works of Satan hallelujah hallelujah we have a reason to Rejoice Hallelujah to Rejoice yes Hallelujah am theil is defeated the plan of God was to beab in man appr to destroy all the works of Satan once and for all his plan was the Alpha and Omega Al Omega the devil had plan a plan B but God's plan was plan Alpha and Omega did you get it his plan was Al and Omega plan so God told Michael God told Michael Michael let us ex Al and Omega plan let us execute Michael it is time to execute that is when he came to Mary oh Hallelujah when Angel Gabriel came down came to execute the plan of God when the Angels saw the devil attacking in Eden when they saw the devil coming to attack Eve and Adam the angels in heaven must have wanted to go and save the day the angels in heaven must have wanted to go and save the day but God had a plan he told all of them to step aside Angels step aside it's not your battle it is my war I'm going to fight it I'm going to win it Hallelujah sometimes it looks like the devil is winning God let the devil win for a moment but he wasn't winning but brother God has a plan it may look like the devil is winning in your life in some areas of your life listen to me this morning brother told us yesterday how can a gentleman shout and make a full of himself it's not me shouting at you it is God speaking to yous it might seem sometimes that the devil is winning in your life in some areas of your life but brother I want you to put it on your mouth and I want you to say God has a plan God has a plan how many will do that say God has a plan God has a plan even if it may look like the devil is wining God has a plan there is no way the devil can win because God is a plan is a winning plan God's plan is always a winning plan so therefore I say in the name of the Lord Jesus hold stand still and see the salvation of the Lord when all the angels wanted to go and help God told them stand aside stand aside it's my time and when God went down in aen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah he he began to put a type a type of his plan he went and quickly took a and he called Adam dressed him up says literally threw them the sick the devil must have been laughing you don't know what I've done you don't know what I've done it's just like someone who has repped your child it's a sad thing isn't it that's what the devil had done and he laughing there with a SC voice you don't know what I've done even if you're dressing you don't know what I've done what I've done I've done there's nothing you can do about God didn't didn't fight with him at that time but God showed what he wanted to do by killing a lamb and the devil laugh what will L do my SE is already the human but God had a plan said it in the beginning he said that the seed of the woman shall bre the head of the the the devil had no idea those were Thunders to the devil it was Thunders to he did understand the seed of the woman shall breathe your head what are you talking about called War cabinet what what does he mean how can a woman have a seed of God thew of God these were captains in heaven before they came down to be Devils before they became Devils they were captains in heaven so they know how God does things but they did not know they did not know all that God does is it possible for a woman to have a seat is it any no so what is going to happen we have no idea is a top secret but the plan of God was to use the seed of the woman why couldn't the devil understand it because it was coded with language and re that the devil can't understand there are some Revelations that cannot fit in the devil's little head there are some Revelations that the devil cannot be able to F he can't go around he can't understand it and one of those reation the devil can't understand the seed of the woman that meant a child born without a biological physical human father the devil can't understand how will it be he was confused he can't understand in his little stupid oh my goodness thank you for Revelation thank you Jesus for reation thank you for ration what the devil can't understand has revealed it to you has revealed it to B can hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen then we find then in the message having conferences then we find then when God found them standing behind a bush somewhere shivering talking about Adam and Eve and with their fig leaves aons on make certain places and then called a conference together I guess God when when he found Adam and Eve hid behind a bush over there they couldn't come out they said we can't come out father we are naked and he said who told you you were naked so God looked around and he found a tree a certain place a place he thought would be beautiful a place God looked and he said it is beautiful and he got some skins and skins skins yeah of animals skins and he threw them back in the bushes and he said cover yourselves and come out before me and they had a conference they talked it over then God made a preparation for them and even today the devil doesn't know when he executes his plan in your life God calls for a conference and we are here today because we are here to talk it over with God God doesn't forsake his own so then God made a preparation for them I'm so glad there was an Aiden conference not let us go under the Fig Tree under the Fig leaves and something we can SE up together but God killed something but God killed something to cover their sins and and then he gave a promise that through the woman seed would crush the Serpent's head the prophet says here God was for telling what he would do so God was for telling his plan I'm so glad of the Aiden conference he made a way a preparation a way to take away sin thank God for the Eden conference he made a way to take away sin he made a way that you could come back again sister if you are lost in sin Let Me prophesy to you again hallelujah hallelujah God made a way for you to come back again and if you're backing and you are here this morning you're going to come back again the devil can't hinder that be brought back into Fellowship where you would lost and standing out somewhere undone without God God made a preparation confence God is making a preparation if he did a preparation at aen conference he's making a preparation at conference hallelujah amen now now now there is a conference going on just this was he says he just made a preparation tempor until the real preparation would be given through the sacrificial L Christ through the sacrificial Life of Christ he spoke it would do that but between that time the lamb had to die until that time until the Lamb of God came that was to breathe the Serpent's head and he to bre the heel until Calvary that conference was successful that conference was successful and brother bam says it will beat sat it will beat sat anywhere God is word will defeat sat any place be a scet and he said you said any conditions by the that's exactly what it said any condition what condition are you in this morning don't shy away don't hide away from the sometimes the Devil beats you down so much that you can't even say Amen because you are thinking about your sins I'm here to tell you this even in your condition the word of God will beat Satan Hallelujah no matter what you have done say Amen to the word of God and it shall be because God is God and His word FS not and the devil always has missed God's great plan Eden was only a type of a greater plan a type of a greater a shadow of a greater plan the devil must have laughs at what happened he didn't know this was just the beginning oh Hallelujah I wish to tell the devil that has been tormenting my life if you want you can do the same that Satan this is just a beginning who is going to do that who is going to do that devil this is this is just the beginning this is just the beginning when God killed a lamb that was just a beginning hallelujah hallelujah when God gave

can forgive your he can make you holy it's not you it is all about him Hallelujah whatever he's doing with you is just the beginning to think that God would just kill some sheep and cloth Adam this looks stupid before the devil to think that Jesus would die it looks stupid before the devil but that was just the beginning someone should have told him devil this is just the beginning someone should have told the devil hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah well God went and took a lamb squeezed it and and he threw the skins theil was just laughing he was in the seat of the scord how can how can

thing which shall be born shall be shall be God oh my God being a Son of God means you are God that thing which will be listen we go back to Genesis the devil did not know what it meant and now for the first time in hisory years and years after thousands of years after God came down to execute his plan maybe God has taken so long in your life but don't you think may be your moment Years After I'm saying to you Church years after God is now speaking to you saying he has come to execute his plan and when he comes he doesn't work with politics he doesn't work by denomination it doesn't work by doctrines of by dogas and Creeds when he comes he doesn't work by dogmas and Creeds by this group by that group by this idea by that idea and we the ones who have who have it all the ones who know it all I believe at that time they had houses filled with virgins waiting to conceive God bypassed it all God wanted to choose a little unknown virgin somewhere there in the middle of nowhere right there in kosi a little nobody and God would choose them and then he would reveal to them things even demons did not know things even angels did not know things that no man knew religious lead did not know and the little Mary asked how shall it be hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah why do you think that brother bam did not record how to receive the Holy Ghost brother did not record the sermon how to receive the Holy Ghost told us what the Holy Ghost is what was given for it is simple God reveals it to the humble to the babes just can learn and he comes to Mary and he says you you are going to be with child she says how will it be how how tell me how give me the MTH M the calculations know explain it to me and here when the angel spoke don't you worry Mary Hallelujah don't you

mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh God was justified in the spirit God was seen of angels God was preached onto the Gentiles God was believ on The World God was received up into Glory it is a mystery not even the devil knew it when the devil saw him who is this man said okay okay if come you be the son of God makeon it is written man shall not live by bread alone okay if you be the Son of God it is written listen to me devil kept on doubting he he was doubting that even when Jesus died when he was at the cross he sent a demon to provoke him to see what will come out of him if you say who you are that you're Son of God if it wasn't that he wasn't sure about this one it was a mystery of in it overwhelmed the devil you could understand it and has overwhelmed religious people today they can't understand the mystery of God and and and he and he overcame that part and kept on doubting him all the way to the Grave all the way to hell and when Jesus Christ bang those doors [Music] open so you are here yes I'm here I'm the Virgin born son of God said he said and I've come down here to take over hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah we are not born by the will of

Hallelujah Hallelujah that's what the prophet said that if the church shall know who she is and where she stands for the devil cannot defeat we are the church we know who we areac hallelujah hallelujah because of that every demon has to be under our feet Hallelujah you can shout if you want to Hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah the devil can't understand even why we are shouting I told you a little stupid head Li it has a limitation the devil can't understand these are deep waters for him you a man calling yourself God yes [Applause] Sirac they baby little mang but they didn't understand he was that's why God was careful reveal this to the big people and educated philosophers he revealed the babes such as can learn he was 100% God was born the Christ he said before Abraham he said I'm the resurrection and the life me myself me myself I'm the direction of the life I am the Al and Omega I am the only plan I am the plan I am the andega I am the creator of all things the world was made by me there is nothing that is made that was made without me and that's why I ra the dead I rais the dead because I'm the resurrection and the life that's why I heal the sick because I'm the resurrection and the life that's why I forgive sins what manner of [Music] man he says woman don't worry about what they saying your sins are forgiven you did you see what he did he forgave don't worry your heads can't take that because you are too big to understand but they're too little can understand the Shepherds can understand Mary can understand J can understand can understand you can understand hallelujah hallelujah de in he was 100% man he had Flesh and Blood he cried actually says he wept he was tempted like you and I in all areas of life even sexual Temptations brother balam says what did you say you have to repent no the prophet said he was tempted even with sexual Temptations let that sink in but yet he was not overcome he died how can God die that was a human being like you and me but he was God was tabernacling right in there hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen my God in the testimony of a true witness all right he says oh God what is it the Holy Ghost the true witness of God what is it let me go back again let me rewind because some people have missed the Bible tells us to wait one on another so let us rewind he begins by saying oh God what is it the Holy Ghost the true witness of God what is itac in man have you ever heard that those are not my words from our Prophet what is the holy [Music] ghost in and the prophet says hallelujah hallelujah what church that is the reason I cannot take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of crying Shing or of speaking in tes or any sensation and he says they are all right now brother is not saying we should not cry should not Shake we should not speak in Tong we should not be excited right now how many are excited it's okay he says that is all but he says I cannot take the Holy Ghost be only those things them things are all right but here's the problem the devil can impersonate all that so real so real but the Holy Ghost is God tacle in it is more than a sensation it is more than speaking in Tong is your Prophet saying this is more than shouting in a spirit it is more than weeping it is more than joining Church it is God living in man God himself in that person Hallelujah when he can speak it is just the as God speaking that is the Church of Jesus Christ that is the way the First Apostolic Church went forth all right I'll read you the last quote here the second last I don't know listen listen listen quickly same message we need a day of weeping and mourning and waiting until God sends the Holy Ghost his witness not an empty shell notty denomination but Jesus said in Mark 16h when he comes will testify in every succeeding generation to the end he said this sign shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devil Hallelujah in my name they shall cast out Dev how long is this witness going to be to the end of the world how long every generation in my name they shall cast out they shall speak with new Tong if they take up serpent or drink any deadly thing if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover Jesus said that the Holy Spirit the holy spirit that you would send would be a witness to the End of the Age every generation now being that he said that we Are Witnesses we are witness amen and in closing listen close this was going to to be my my last I got another one but he says here listen close put
