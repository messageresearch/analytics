[1:56:14] i've been trying to gather now uh might
[1:56:17] be a little bit deeper for some beings
[1:56:21] but please i would like you to pay full
[1:56:24] attention
[1:56:26] you know more
[1:56:36] some of these things will help you to be
[1:56:38] established in christchurch
[1:56:54] that means even a car is coming
[1:56:59] and don't say now god has provided for
[1:57:01] him which means he's also working on
[1:57:02] youtube
[1:57:06] working on you um
[1:57:14] now we've read john 3 john 16 to summon
[1:57:18] your khan accommodation how big when he
[1:57:20] the spirit of truth is come
[1:57:28] and i did not speak about last sunday
[1:57:30] because i did speak on it on wednesday
[1:57:32] uh sunday
[1:57:37] i where not speak about
[1:57:39] last sunday because i spoke
[1:57:41] about wednesday amen sunday with this
[1:57:44] actually
[1:57:49] i mean uh we were in
[1:57:51] twilight
[1:57:52] and god gave us a wonderful time there
[1:57:54] come here
[1:57:57] and uh the saints sent their greetings
[1:57:59] to you
[1:58:02] amen in the name of jesus christ and uh
[1:58:06] brother martin god bless you for giving
[1:58:08] the word on sunday organizing
[1:58:11] sunday now in johnny says when the
[1:58:14] spirit of truth has come
[1:58:16] until
[1:58:18] he is going to do many things again that
[1:58:20] could have intervened one of it we saw
[1:58:22] that he will guide you into all troops
[1:58:25] [Music]
[1:58:31] so we already spoke about him as a guy
[1:58:47] he says he will show you things to come
[1:58:50] again
[1:58:51] again
[1:58:52] so in other words million dollars there
[1:58:54] will be things to come wake up
[1:58:57] into every night just like you see a
[1:58:59] little child whatever number
[1:59:03] [Applause]
[1:59:04] [Music]
[1:59:28] so we were able to speak about the
[1:59:30] maturity of the or the growth of the
[1:59:31] church
[1:59:36] and when i saw when i talked about the
[1:59:38] church
[1:59:39] i am talking about the church edges
[1:59:43] you know some people you know uh just
[1:59:46] think that church is judging
[1:59:48] the church
[1:59:52] okay first of all i want you to
[1:59:53] understand that these are fellowships
[1:59:57] every group you see gathering somewhere
[1:59:59] whether that one thousand two thousand
[2:00:01] or one hundred or a few like here it is
[2:00:04] a fellowship
[2:00:09] um
[2:00:53] passed that track request they can see
[2:00:55] you amen i mean and that church has been
[2:00:58] on this earth
[2:01:01] from the days of the apostles
[2:01:04] until today
[2:01:06] but now we read many prophecies
[2:01:09] talk about that
[2:01:11] and say that that church is coming to
[2:01:13] maturity
[2:01:17] there have been different messengers
[2:01:20] that
[2:01:27] [Applause]
[2:01:57] [Music]
[2:02:29] [Music]
[2:02:30] been the same holy spirit
[2:02:33] and we found out
[2:02:35] that
[2:02:36] this oil was being powered into a
[2:02:38] reservoir
[2:02:42] you know i don't know if i have the
[2:02:43] image here
[2:02:45] i might not have the image to show
[2:02:46] explaining
[2:02:48] but we didn't speak about it the other
[2:02:50] day
[2:02:52] how many remember
[2:02:55] you remember that
[2:02:57] okay so then that reservoir
[2:03:00] was collecting all the oil
[2:03:04] and that and
[2:03:06] this reservoir
[2:03:08] was a symbol
[2:03:10] of a prophetic ministry
[2:03:27] from the olive trees
[2:03:30] and it would be collected into that
[2:03:32] reservoir
[2:03:35] amen from god
[2:03:38] a messenger
[2:04:21] jesus christ
[2:04:32] [Applause]
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:05:03] it was lighted by god
[2:06:00] the pattern of god
[2:06:04] how he has been dealing with the church
[2:06:08] from the days of the apostles
[2:06:12] when he sent the first apostle
[2:06:14] to me
[2:06:55] foreign
[2:07:53] [Music]
[2:08:21] to help you study on the chart ages in
[2:08:23] full
[2:08:24] weight
[2:08:27] mechanism you can have it for free
[2:08:29] without money with that
[2:08:35] hallelujah i mean he's talking about
[2:08:37] these things
[2:08:40] very precious thing
[2:08:43] i wonder people sell
[2:08:44] very useless books for a lot of money
[2:08:46] and people buy
[2:08:48] it
[2:08:50] [Music]
[2:09:14] it was the first one you can say yes and
[2:09:16] apostle paul
[2:10:52] amen when they believed in god
[2:11:21] they were coming
[2:11:22] from paradise to go to gloryland

[2:20:40] too many preachers in our generations
[2:21:23] foreign
[2:21:38] like a wise man never said about this
[2:21:40] they decided to follow this star in our
[2:21:43] generation

[2:21:50] you are one of them
[2:22:08] is at hand the same day this message

[2:26:19] the holy spirit the denominations are
[2:26:21] talking about is not the holy spirit
[2:26:27] the holy spirit they talk about is the
[2:26:29] one that allows them to do anything they
[2:26:31] want as long as they feel it
[2:26:40] [Music]
[2:27:09] [Music]
