[1:39] [Music]
[2:06] Hallelujah
[2:08] Do You Love That Man From Galilee
[2:12] praise the name of the Lord
[2:14] [Music]
[2:17] amen you may have your seats
[2:23] I want to greet you all in the name of
[2:24] Jesus Christ
[2:39] praise the Lord
[2:43] I would like to appreciate all the songs
[2:45] that have been sang
[2:50] and uh
[2:52] I'd like to thank God for your coming as
[2:54] well this morning
[2:58] I believe that the holy spirit will
[3:00] speak to us today
[3:05] now before we go to the world I have
[3:08] quite a lot of announcements and our
[3:10] time is First spent so I really do not
[3:12] know uh I usually not want to preach
[3:15] when you are tired
[3:27] and everything is important
[3:32] now I have an invitation here
[3:39] I will not take time to read it because
[3:40] of time
[3:43] but this is uh addressed to
[3:48] days of the voice Fellowship
[3:53] inviting us to the wedding of Pastor
[3:55] Charles
[4:00] is one of the elders in this country um
[4:09] but about two or three years ago I think
[4:12] it's now two he lost his wife
[4:16] and God blessed him with a a wonderful
[4:19] sister now
[4:22] and so they are they already had their
[4:25] introduction ceremony yeah
[4:27] and they're going to get married
[4:30] on 10th December
[4:33] at the church
[4:36] so you are all invited
[4:40] go and be a part of that okay
[4:44] now I know that we are going into uh we
[4:47] are already in December
[4:50] and December is a very busy man
[4:54] and you know now we are very much
[4:56] connected most of you are already on
[4:58] social media and you are seeing a lot of
[5:00] invitations
[5:05] but I also believe that we should always
[5:07] be guided by our pastor
[5:12] don't always run to wherever you are
[5:14] invited to America
[5:17] always receive guidance
[5:20] not everywhere you are going you will
[5:23] you will get food
[5:26] praise the Lord
[5:28] but we have a lot of invitations even
[5:31] now as I came in I just received one
[5:33] that I had not seen before before
[5:38] so I don't know whether you will
[5:40] conflict with our programs but we'll
[5:42] look at it
[5:46] but from 22nd to 26th of this month
[5:53] we have uh two conventions
[5:59] and they're all believersions
[6:03] we myself and a few of you have always
[6:06] been a part of the convention in Kenya
[6:09] [Music]
[6:13] during that time this usually called the
[6:15] Christmas meetings
[6:20] so this time again they have invited us
[6:23] to go and be a part of those meetings
[6:25] [Music]
[6:27] anyone that has a national ID and a pass
[6:30] or a passport you can be able to go to
[6:32] those meetings
[6:38] some of you were born here and I've
[6:40] never gone anywhere else
[6:44] it is healthy to cross the border
[6:49] it gives you a test of what heaven will
[6:51] be you'll meet Believers of all kinds
[6:58] so that will take place during that
[7:00] weekend too
[7:02] [Music]
[7:03] and also we have a a convention uh here
[7:08] that our usual annual conversion in
[7:10] Uganda
[7:14] Uganda it's called a Believers annual
[7:16] Believers convention
[7:19] this is usually
[7:22] prepared by pasta Joseph
[7:27] of evening light bright
[7:30] evening light bright Tabernacle that is
[7:33] also going to take place during that
[7:34] same weekend of 22nd to 26th
[7:41] so now I am personally invited to
[7:44] minister to both meetings
[7:48] and I thought I should cancel one but uh
[7:51] then again it was difficult
[7:56] so I'll be going to both by God's grace
[8:00] [Music]
[8:03] but you all are welcome to go to both as
[8:06] well or to whichever that you will feel
[8:08] led to go to
[8:15] Uganda is usually in theater is it
[8:18] called Saturn Hill
[8:20] College
[8:24] it's a resident meeting so when you go
[8:27] there you get accommodation at the
[8:29] school again
[8:35] foreign
[8:47] I think
[8:52] Uganda so on Wednesday 21st to 23rd
[8:56] myself I'll be going to Kenya in
[8:59] Japanese
[9:08] Kenya so I will travel back on 23rd
[9:13] to minister on 24th in this set of
[9:17] convention
[9:23] foreign the meeting so I'm going to
[9:26] preach the last meeting
[9:29] and also
[9:33] one on 20 24th which is a Saturday
[9:39] because of these two programs
[9:43] and also because we all can be a part of
[9:47] that meeting Norway
[9:51] I did not find it necessary for us to
[9:54] open our church during that time
[10:01] so
[10:02] on the Sunday of 25th Katy Sunday
[10:07] which is going to be the Christmas Day
[10:13] I am asking all of us to go and
[10:16] participate in that meeting
[10:21] we shall not have a service here
[10:25] so don't come
[10:28] and also inform others to go in that
[10:30] meeting is
[10:35] amen Amina
[10:38] I hope you're writing this somewhere
[10:43] please don't forget
[10:44] we also have a youth convention
[10:49] and I spoke to brother robots
[10:53] about a record two ago
[10:57] telling me that they have that meeting
[11:00] it's usually they I think they've been
[11:03] preparing it for some time
[11:06] but that meeting or that convention you
[11:09] have to pay to get there
[11:13] one hundred and forty thousand
[11:17] it is to the younger people
[11:19] the youth so if you have the money
[11:24] and they want to go and be a part of it
[11:28] I'd like to let you know you are free to
[11:30] go yeah
[11:32] that is from 29th to First January
[11:39] I hope you're writing this somewhere
[11:41] those of you who are planning to
[11:43] participate in this meeting
[11:48] um
[11:50] now I spoke about our business meeting
[11:53] we usually hear in this church we have
[11:56] our annual business meeting
[12:04] We Don't Preach
[12:06] we just made to tell you about what your
[12:11] money has been doing that you have been
[12:12] giving throughout the year
[12:20] we have to account to you because you
[12:23] give
[12:26] and also we have a project that we are
[12:29] currently running that is the our
[12:33] Churchland fans
[12:39] and I think at this time I can also give
[12:42] you an update
[12:46] um
[12:47] noticed that since we moved here is
[12:55] those of you who were on fire
[12:59] giving
[13:00] daily and weekly with monthly week
[13:05] you just stopped
[13:06] I think when you arrived here you
[13:08] thought you have now bought the Judgment
[13:10] Hallelujah
[13:14] we have not bought the churchlands
[13:19] and we have not arrived yet
[13:22] so
[13:23] in the business meeting I'll talk more
[13:25] details
[13:28] but since October 1.
[13:34] only a handful of names and these are
[13:36] recording names
[13:41] and most of them are actually members of
[13:43] my my family
[13:46] that is myself
[13:52] and then also uh brother
[13:55] calebu and uh brother Peter burganda
[13:58] Peter
[14:00] um brother Solomon also gave something
[14:02] on November third Solomon
[14:05] those are the only names I've seen
[14:09] since October movies
[14:16] if you've given anything since October
[14:19] first
[14:26] that means we never received it
[14:30] and um
[14:36] brother Tim brother Tim God came and
[14:39] visited us here
[14:42] he was his time was short so he didn't
[14:45] have time to minister uh to us
[14:51] but when he came
[14:55] and his wife
[14:57] and my family the family we were able to
[15:01] meet him Brother Martin Thomas he had a
[15:04] little Fellowship
[15:06] and they sponsor the printing work in
[15:10] the office
[15:14] print books that we supply to the whole
[15:16] country
[15:19] also across the borders
[15:24] Ethiopia and also to to Rwanda
[15:28] so those Brothers sponsor the paper and
[15:31] some of you here contribute your time
[15:34] you volunteered to print that
[15:46] of a team he had
[15:48] yeah
[15:50] and when he came here
[15:52] he was surprised and he was moved you
[15:57] know the other Church where we were can
[15:59] you say he went right I think it was
[16:00] just half of this section
[16:05] those of you who don't know that
[16:08] action there foreign
[16:24] and I want to say and to let you know
[16:27] that he also contributed 1.4 million
[16:33] a
[16:36] um
[16:36] I think that is so far the only money we
[16:39] have received from someone from another
[16:42] country
[16:43] from another country foreign
[17:07] who are you sister Esther
[17:10] right there oh yeah and she gave she had
[17:14] a bucket a box
[17:16] [Music]
[17:18] broke it open when she had we're going
[17:21] to collect it for church
[17:24] she was in p7 at the time
[17:28] so she contributed 11 000.
[17:32] how are you and uh
[17:35] I want to tell you we have we are not
[17:37] struck with the vision
[17:43] but from what I'm saying here
[17:46] I think many of you
[17:48] are either tired
[17:54] I know that it's not been easy in these
[17:57] past few months
[18:00] but I believe you can surely do much
[18:03] better than this
[18:06] I will reserve my comments and most of
[18:09] the details in our business meeting
[18:14] but I want to say to that we've given a
[18:17] total of 29 Millions 149 000.
[18:28] now some of that when we were moving
[18:31] here we we used it to do a few things
[18:34] here
[18:38] but like I said we will talk about the
[18:41] details in the business meeting

[24:21] [Music]
[24:26] but today good for me to come here
[24:36] thank you so much
[24:43] I I just told him he did not inform us
[24:46] that he was coming
[24:48] but yeah otherwise we would have loved
[24:51] to hear him
[24:54] but we'll get to know you more
[25:00] let us sing Joy to the World
[25:12] Brothers
[25:15] [Music]
[25:30] [Applause]
[25:34] [Music]
[25:54] [Music]
[26:01] foreign
[26:03] [Music]
[26:34] comes to
[26:36] places
[26:38] [Music]
[27:13] oh joy to the wildest Glory Days
[27:27] [Music]
[28:15] I see
[28:19] let us pray
[28:23] Lord Jesus
[28:27] we know it is the reality
[28:31] that one day you were born in a manger
[28:33] okay
[28:37] that is
[28:38] [Music]
[28:47] I know once again you were born
[28:51] foreign
[28:55] [Music]
[29:08] and as we speak on this
[29:12] rare subjects
[29:14] [Music]
[29:21] at the end of this service
[29:26] give me inspiration
[29:28] let your Holy Spirit
[29:30] [Music]
[29:36] [Music]
[29:38] foreign
[29:41] [Music]
[29:51] I'm just praying that the Lord will
[29:53] count me down and uh
[29:56] so I don't just go over the things but
[29:58] be sensitively his spirit
[30:05] and if you don't get done maybe we'll
[30:08] just carry on on Wednesday
[30:11] praise the Lord so it is December
[30:15] this is the month they say
[30:19] that Jesus was born
[30:24] of course we know that is not true
[30:26] um
[30:35] okay so those are the things I want us
[30:37] to deal with everybody
[30:42] and this is one that actually shocks a
[30:45] lot of people when they get to realize
[30:47] it
[30:50] if there is one thing that is really so
[30:52] bad whoever wishing there is nothing as
[30:56] bad as tradition they were
[31:02] say why by slowly erases the truth
[31:06] and the truth sometimes and many times
[31:09] is actually replaced with tradition
[31:13] Al
[31:17] and when you tell somebody a tradition
[31:19] is not true
[31:23] they will disfellowship with you
[31:26] they will disconnect themselves from you
[31:32] and they will say you have a first
[31:33] doctor
[31:35] like you know when we tell people that
[31:38] the Trinity is a Doctrine from hell
[31:41] yeah
[31:44] it's a Catholic Doctrine
[31:47] it has nothing to do with the Bible
[31:50] oh they will frown at you
[31:52] they will tell you what because the
[31:55] Trinity has been preached as a major
[31:58] Christian doctrine for centuries
[32:05] but last Sunday we dealt with that next
[32:09] Sunday
[32:10] we were able to find out there is
[32:12] nothing like a trinity or persons
[32:16] there is only a trinity of a person one
[32:19] year
[32:32] that manifests himself in three
[32:35] different manifestations
[32:41] but then they said father is God son is
[32:44] God and holy spirit is God and each of
[32:46] them is independent
[32:51] um
[32:55] but that is not true there is nothing
[32:58] like an eternal son
[33:01] because to be an eternal son you have to
[33:04] be without beginning and without ending
[33:11] but we know that Jesus
[33:13] at the beginning
[33:19] at the beginning
[33:23] [Music]
[33:45] you can go and listen to that someone is
[33:48] called the unrecognized Christ
[33:55] so this morning we are going to deal
[33:58] with Christ in Christmas
[34:02] now I know among the message circles
[34:44] we should not do something because we
[34:47] want to look different
[34:49] and I want to thank God because we have
[34:52] a guide
[34:54] the holy spirit is our God
[34:56] but the Holy Spirit uses men and women
[35:00] and in our generation he has used the
[35:03] prophet
[36:04] that's why foreign
[36:38] foreign
[37:14] we will read from verses 1 to 7.
[37:22] and it came to pass in those days that
[37:24] they went out a decree from Caesar
[37:26] Augustus that all the world should be
[37:27] taxed and this taxing was first made
[37:30] once geranius was governor of Syria
[37:34] and all and all went to be taxed
[37:39] everyone into his own City
[37:43] and Joseph also went up From Galilee out
[37:47] of the city of Nazareth into Judea and
[37:50] to the city of David which is called
[37:52] Bethlehem because he was the he was of
[37:55] the house and lineage of David to be
[37:58] taxed with Mary his espoused wife being
[38:01] great with child and so it was that
[38:04] while they were there the days were
[38:06] accomplished that she should be
[38:07] delivered and she brought forth her
[38:09] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[38:12] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[38:14] Manger because there was no room for
[38:16] them in the Inn again
[38:21] [Music]
[39:08] [Music]
[39:19] because there was no room for them in
[39:22] the Inn
[39:27] ate together
[39:29] for everyone now because there was no
[39:32] room for them in the air amen you may be
[39:36] seated
[39:38] now in the message the acts of the Holy
[39:40] Spirit
[39:44] the prophet of God says
[39:48] now as we are approaching Christmas time
[39:50] now cutting electricity foreign
[39:54] [Music]
[40:10] [Music]
[40:27] one they're decorating that by my team
[40:29] W1 and instead of Jesus
[40:35] we are approaching Christmas together
[40:38] this is what they are doing
[40:44] do I have your attention this morning
[40:47] they are decorating Santa Claus but
[40:50] Timber Santa Claus instead of Jesus they
[40:53] don't even spell it anymore
[40:57] Christmas Christmas
[41:02] it is
[41:06] they don't even spell Christ in
[41:09] Christmas anymore
[41:21] what it is really good teacher cheat
[41:24] again and they think other clothes
[41:27] and instead of rejoicing under the
[41:31] spirit of God
[41:33] they go out and get drunk and rejoice
[41:39] and listen to me the prophet of God says
[41:41] here that is what makes the difference
[41:47] if there is effect Allah
[41:50] there will be an original door
[41:53] actually the very reason why there is a
[41:56] fake dollar is
[41:58] because there is an original dollar
[42:01] into anything wrong there is something
[42:04] right
[42:07] and so we see that the people the
[42:09] correct uh whenever Christmas time comes
[42:14] there is something I want to draw your
[42:16] attention
[42:18] that it's not about Jesus
[42:21] what we see on the outside
[42:24] is actually not about the Jesus of the
[42:27] Bible
[42:32] they get drunk and then they Rejoice so
[42:37] I want to ask you a question why are
[42:39] they rejoicing is it because of the
[42:41] birth of Christ
[42:43] because of the alcohol
[42:48] what is the celebration about teaching
[42:51] from the beginning the birth of Jesus
[42:54] Christ was not celebrated
[42:58] from the beginning
[43:00] we've read it together here
[43:03] you know it was time the time of taxing
[43:07] charity
[43:09] and the emperor had given an orders
[43:14] he said everyone in the world should be
[43:17] attacked
[43:19] and so everyone started to go to where
[43:22] they came from
[43:25] and Joseph you know the story of Joseph
[43:27] and
[43:29] Maryam how Joseph was espoused engaged
[43:33] with Mary history
[43:35] and then she he found one day he woke up
[43:38] and found
[43:39] his girlfriend pregnant
[43:45] and you know there is only one reason
[43:49] that a man can divorce a wife
[44:05] as a matter of fact Jesus himself when
[44:07] he came yesterday he said If any man
[44:11] um
[44:12] divorces his wife
[44:14] and marriage
[44:18] accept it before the cause of
[44:21] fornication
[44:24] um
[44:30] now listen let me explain that a little
[44:33] more so there is a difference between
[44:36] fornication and adultery
[44:39] nobody
[44:41] right
[44:46] living
[44:50] is immorality
[44:53] before marriage
[44:59] is the same act
[45:02] done by somebody who is married
[45:18] [Music]
[45:30] because she is your wife
[45:33] adultery does not warrant divorce
[45:37] I always
[45:46] fornication dance
[45:49] so how can I married a woman for the kid
[45:52] um
[46:02] so that means if the God does it um
[46:07] and 10 years later
[46:10] she's married to her husband
[46:14] you know I'm a virgin
[46:17] you know he finds out 10 years later
[46:21] [Music]
[46:22] they have a family
[46:25] [Music]
[46:27] that man has a right to divorce her um
[46:33] because they never married to begin with
[46:38] marriage must be made on the basis of
[46:41] good faithful
[46:44] [Music]
[47:21] you must confess your life to him
[47:25] just like we confess our life to Jesus
[47:28] [Music]
[47:29] before he takes us in as his wife
[47:33] and after we confess everything to him
[47:37] he forgives us everything we did in the
[47:40] past
[47:41] and he says all the past is now gone
[47:43] [Music]
[48:01] so here we find out that Joseph was
[48:05] engaged with Mary
[48:07] and Mary was a virgin Mary
[48:11] but later on
[48:13] Joseph finds out that Mary is pregnant
[48:17] oh she lied to me she must have lied to
[48:21] me but Joseph was a good man
[48:25] you didn't want to ashamed
[48:29] so he wanted to leave her but privately
[48:38] but that same night the angel of the
[48:42] Lord came to Joseph
[48:44] do not divorce your wife married
[48:51] he is of the Holy Ghost
[48:54] praise the name of the Lord amen and we
[48:56] notice that Jesus yes was not made out
[48:59] of the egg of Mary yes
[49:03] but he actually came from the word of
[49:06] God
[49:08] he himself was the world
[49:13] praise the name of the Lord
[49:15] and so now Joseph carries on with his
[49:18] wife
[49:20] and he said okay let us now raise this
[49:23] child
[49:25] and one day they have gone to do the
[49:29] taxing
[49:30] with Mary Maryam and Mary was about to
[49:34] deliver Mariam
[49:36] of the pregnancy
[49:39] and while they were there the Bible says
[49:43] the days were accomplished
[49:46] we shall come back to this but I want to
[49:48] ask you how many days does a woman take
[49:50] to deliver
[49:57] foreign
[50:22] [Music]
[50:26] and Lady him
[50:29] because there was listen now to this
[50:31] because there was no room for them in
[50:34] the innate she for
[50:39] eign
[50:59] did they celebrate it
[51:01] as a matter of fact when Mary was going
[51:03] to give back
[51:05] she went to the to the Inn again with
[51:08] Joseph
[51:10] to try and find just a room
[51:13] where Jesus where Jesus will be born yes
[51:17] but everybody told him I'm sorry
[51:21] we are busy
[51:24] they must I'm sure they must have gone
[51:26] in almost every place
[51:31] if they were the only available places
[51:44] we are preaching we are so busy foreign
[52:09] anymore
[52:11] the religious man of the time did not
[52:14] celebrate it but nothing eventually
[52:16] the Romans the national leaders
[52:20] they did not celebrate it the family of
[52:24] both Mary even the family
[52:27] [Music]
[52:29] you don't know what we are talking about
[52:31] you're not giving birth to a child
[52:35] is not celebrating
[52:40] it means it is
[52:44] you know children you know children are
[52:47] joy in the home
[52:49] and you know even whenever a girl even
[52:52] becomes pregnant without being married
[52:56] you know many people will not celebrate
[52:59] the birth of a child and to find your
[53:02] Humanity but at least
[53:16] [Music]
[53:31] [Music]
[53:56] [Music]

[57:52] [Music]
[57:58] question
[58:48] you know one day I was just thinking

[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:01:52] the
[1:01:54] Bible says in the Book of Romans
[1:02:02] why because it is
[1:02:11] and this gospel is the power I am not
[1:02:14] ashamed to carry my Bible

[1:04:51] story of Jesus
[1:04:56] as a matter of fact the Bible does not
[1:04:59] tell us to celebrate the birth of Christ
[1:05:02] and if we celebrate our own birthdays
[1:05:11] I want to say this to you
[1:05:14] as the true pride of Christ
[1:05:17] kind of people to celebrate the birth of
[1:05:20] Christ amen

[1:06:57] and Lord the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[1:06:59] them and the glory of the Lord Shone
[1:07:01] right about them and they were so afraid
[1:07:04] and the angels said unto them fear not
[1:07:06] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[1:07:09] great joy Hallelujah who shall be to all
[1:07:13] people read that Lucas new
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:37] all right I mean yes
[1:07:58] amen I want you to see how Jesus wants
[1:08:03] to receive his birth
[1:08:07] Jesus did not go to the priests
[1:08:09] yesterday against he did not go to the
[1:08:12] to the king
[1:08:14] he didn't even go to the them churches
[1:08:17] the synagogues but where did he go by
[1:08:22] advisation of angels
[1:08:25] you went to the Shepherds
[1:08:27] where was Jesus born yes yes
[1:08:35] so he went to the Shepherds
[1:08:38] who understand the manger
[1:08:43] I mean hallelujah amen so you went to
[1:08:47] the surface they were at the lowest and
[1:08:51] I always sized people
[1:08:54] of their time even today
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:08:59] what is a
[1:09:02] shepherdachi you know when you go to the
[1:09:04] Village
[1:09:05] you find them you know having a road
[1:09:10] stinking clothes

[1:09:15] dungus
[1:09:18] having that you know just you know

[1:09:24] and then you know
[1:09:26] you know going with the cows

[1:09:35] so when you really pass a Shepherd
[1:09:39] you look down on them
[1:09:47] shepherds are not great people
[1:09:51] just like Lambs
[1:10:15] hallelujah amen and when the angel of
[1:10:19] the Lord came down and light the glory
[1:10:20] of the Lord Shone around about them

[1:11:04] they came on the day Jesus was born
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:12] the wise man
[1:11:15] they came between one another and two
[1:11:18] years after the birth of Jesus
[1:11:21] [Music]
[1:11:24] you remember that after they left but
[1:11:28] I'm out of fire and the King wanted to
[1:11:31] kill the children because he wanted to
[1:11:32] kill Jesus
[1:11:36] killed everyone two years and below
[1:11:43] because Jesus at that time was in that
[1:11:45] age group
[1:11:48] but the people around to that made the
[1:11:51] birth of Jesus on the same day
[1:12:02] Christo

[1:12:27] God and saying glory to God in the
[1:12:31] highest and on the earth peace Good Will

[1:12:36] and it was it was and it came to pass us
[1:12:38] the Angels were gone away from them into
[1:12:41] heaven the shepherd said unto one
[1:12:42] another let us now go even unto

[1:12:54] lying in a manger and when they had seen
[1:12:57] it they made known abroad the saying
[1:12:59] which was told them concerning this
[1:13:01] child and all that they had and all they
[1:13:04] that had it wandered orders at those
[1:13:07] things which were told them by the
[1:13:10] Shepherds but Mary kept all these things
[1:13:12] and pondered them in our heart and the
[1:13:15] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[1:13:16] praising God for all the things that
[1:13:19] they had had and seen as it was told

[1:25:34] thank you
[1:25:36] in December
[1:25:39] we find
[1:25:43] it
[1:25:45] you might be a Catholic
[1:25:48] and you believe Jesus was born on 25th
[1:25:50] December
[1:25:52] I have a question for you was Jesus born
[1:25:56] as a premature yes
[1:26:05] was he put into a woman
[1:26:10] the Bible already has told us
[1:26:14] in Luke chapter 2 verse 6.
[1:26:21] that easy to say of Jesus being born
[1:26:27] the Bible did not say
[1:26:29] oh because Joseph and Mary were walking
[1:26:32] yes
[1:26:34] the pregnancy
[1:26:36] went upside down
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:50] if Jesus was born on 25th December
[1:26:54] since he was born as a premature
[1:26:59] but according to the Bible Bible he had
[1:27:03] full time
[1:27:06] he had to have full time
[1:27:10] be a hundred percent a man
[1:27:14] so that you can be able to save us
[1:27:18] from our sins
[1:27:24] nine months yes
[1:27:38] in Israel are usually born around that
[1:27:40] time
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:27:46] to be born
[1:27:48] around that time
[1:27:53] even when you see when Jesus was born
[1:27:56] they wanted a Manger
[1:27:59] there was no snow
[1:28:04] but whenever you see people celebrating
[1:28:06] Christmas
[1:28:08] during snow time
[1:28:22] why did they choose that date
[1:28:25] that death was already there
[1:28:28] before the birth of Jesus December
[1:28:40] and our Jesus
[1:28:42] was actually born yesterday in the
[1:28:45] springtime
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:50] God bless you
[1:28:53] thank you for opening my eyes
[1:28:56] now I know why they do everything they
[1:28:59] do because
[1:29:00] it has no connection to the birth of
[1:29:03] Jesus
[1:29:08] where is Santa Claus on the day that
[1:29:11] Jesus
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:26] but now as it is
[1:29:29] they have completely there is no Christ
[1:29:46] it's about other gods
[1:29:52] completely about other gods
[1:29:55] that's why they are celebrations
[1:30:02] giving all those kind of gifts of
[1:30:04] alcohol
[1:30:07] and they go out naked
[1:30:09] they're going fornication
[1:30:13] clubs
[1:30:15] Christmas
[1:30:17] not even Christmas anymore it's X-Men
[1:30:20] Christmas
[1:30:22] because the Christ they're celebrating
[1:30:25] is not
[1:30:26] ourselves
[1:30:33] put back Christ in Christmas
[1:30:39] they are celebrating their own Christ
[1:30:47] have our Christmas
[1:30:52] we must tell our children
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:57] what is wrong with food a military coach

[1:31:14] choose to celebrate Christ even today
[1:31:18] what is wrong with that attention the

[1:35:10] 25th yesterday
[1:35:16] the hills of judeaf was full of snow at
[1:35:19] that time

[1:36:15] any Memorial of his coming to the world
[1:36:22] one of the greatest gifts that God ever
[1:36:25] give to the world was Jesus Christ
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:38] giving themselves those kind of gifts
[1:36:45] we are going to give us ourselves the
[1:36:47] gifts
[1:37:08] Christmas because
[1:37:21] oh dear now
[1:37:24] your Prophet received the Bible
[1:37:27] on Christmas
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:36] he had a Christmas tree in his house
[1:37:47] and then the little children you can't
[1:37:50] expect they can't understand
[1:37:52] you have Revelation they don't or you
[1:37:55] know and then he would put the gifts
[1:37:57] under there
[1:37:59] and and you know they would come and
[1:38:01] pick it
[1:38:03] up and they would be so happy that you
[1:38:07] would make their time
[1:38:10] of telling his children
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:24] because my time is done but I will just
[1:38:27] have most of these I'll share them some
[1:38:29] of them on Wednesday if I feel late if
[1:38:30] not I'll just post it on the chat group
[1:38:32] and you can all yeah
[1:38:37] let me read a little more for you in
[1:38:39] Divine Healing he says and the fact of
[1:38:41] all the era and everything there is
[1:38:43] about there is something about it that
[1:38:46] the world tries to make it an Xmas
[1:38:50] moving to Xmas
[1:39:00] he says and the fact of all the errors
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:05] and everything there is
[1:39:15] in this thing there is something about
[1:39:17] it that the world tries to make it an
[1:39:19] X-Men it's
[1:39:27] that the the error is is really the
[1:39:31] world Mexican
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:35] but God has still got a Christmas
[1:39:46] somewhere I went to our house and here
[1:39:53] he's got something about it
[1:39:56] justice the very names and the thoughts
[1:39:59] of the birth of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:03] Oh the world has put Santa Claus in his
[1:40:07] place
[1:40:09] but not the Christians
[1:40:15] still a Christmas a child Christmas
[1:40:19] that's what your Prophet says
[1:40:22] Christianity is still a Christmas
[1:40:26] we have not done it as a next month
[1:40:31] has not remove the Christ we shall not
[1:40:35] remove replace him with Santa Claus
[1:40:37] Santa Claus
[1:40:46] praise the name of the Lord
[1:40:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:51] Christmas is the day of worship
[1:40:53] Christmas
[1:40:54] the prophet says and let me read another
[1:40:58] here in Christianity versus idolatry
[1:40:59] says Christmas is no more a worship
[1:41:01] Christmas
[1:41:03] is a celebration
[1:41:07] gambling arousing just Pagan to the
[1:41:11] limits
[1:41:13] maybe after Christmas I'll speak again
[1:41:15] on Christmas he says
[1:41:18] it won't deprive the little meaning of
[1:41:20] the children
[1:41:22] but you can't tell that that to little
[1:41:26] children like that
[1:41:29] they see little fellows on Christmas
[1:41:31] night getting Christmas presents
[1:41:35] and things like that so they can't
[1:41:39] understand it
[1:41:40] who is a very holy brother
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:45] you told your children
[1:41:47] for us we don't give gifts on Christmas
[1:41:49] Christmas
[1:41:51] but that it is Christmas
[1:41:53] or Christmas Merry Christmas
[1:41:56] and he's seeing the other children
[1:42:03] very many young children who were raised
[1:42:05] by parents who believe the message
[1:42:09] when they became of age
[1:42:18] they didn't follow what the prophet said
[1:42:22] are you hearing me Church
[1:42:23] fathers who are here mothers were here
[1:42:26] it's all right to give your gifts to
[1:42:29] your children on Christmas oh
[1:42:35] it's perfectly all right
[1:42:37] but you can't tell that to little
[1:42:39] children like that they silly the
[1:42:40] fellows on Christmas night getting
[1:42:42] Christmas presents and things like that
[1:42:43] they don't understand it
[1:42:49] together
[1:42:51] and we've got to remember them
[1:42:54] they have things in common
[1:42:57] we've got to bring ourselves down to
[1:43:00] remember them little fellas
[1:43:06] praise the name of the Lord
[1:43:08] in Psalms we would see Jesus
[1:43:14] they have taken the sacredness from
[1:43:16] Christmas
[1:43:19] to make it not at Christmas
[1:43:25] but a day of Celebration
[1:43:29] we do not
[1:43:31] you hear people say we are going to
[1:43:33] Celebration we are going to celebrate
[1:43:35] Christmas
[1:43:37] what is wrong we should never celebrate
[1:43:41] Christmas
[1:43:42] is a day of worship Christmas is not a
[1:43:46] celebration
[1:43:50] hallelujah hallelujah

[1:43:57] where it happened
[1:44:01] from them little Christmases when we
