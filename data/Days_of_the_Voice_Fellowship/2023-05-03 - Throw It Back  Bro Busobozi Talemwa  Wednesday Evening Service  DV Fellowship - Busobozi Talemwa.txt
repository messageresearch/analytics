laid to my church things that I knew not but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth I humbled my soul with fasting and my and my prayer returned into my own bosom but in my adiversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves together yeah the sub the objects gathered themselves together against me and I knew it not they did tear me and seized not foreign Lord how long will thou look on rescue myself from their destructions my darling from the Lions let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully Rejoice over me neither let them wink the eye that hit Me Without a Cause Jesus yeah

throw it back foreign [Applause] Hallelujah man we see here David he was praying yes he was believing what was he trying to say he was trying to throw back in prayer whatever the devil had thrown to him because the purpose of the devil should destroy us to discourage us to make us feel discouraged to make us but I tell you I am one of those this evening Hallelujah that I am determined each time the devil throws something I am determined to throw it back Hallelujah man you see let me tell you whenever the the devil does something sometimes the Lord just looks on you see David was struggling in prayer about his enemy foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so if you are here in the church this evening and the devil is not fighting you in any way that's the clear sign that you are to talk about foreign feel like you know you you were you were useless and and you you feel depressed I feel sad you know you have more strings sometimes the Devil comes and takes away your joy of Salvation and throws you sadness and then you begin to be there when you feel in your heart you have an empty vacuum and you see because you are under a storm because the devil has put you another storm to understand sometimes do these other things it is sickness what day sometimes it is because you are poor you have no money and you're trying to work but things are not working and you want to give up sometimes let me tell you and you throw it back foreign [Music] the devil there to cut off the very program of God God has a program with you Hallelujah man today I'm preaching to people who have come to China have you come to church I said have you come to church amen one sister there two sister you have come to church you have you come to church when I was there yes and I'm preaching to you today and I'm telling you right in the very first chapter um we find a devil there to cut off the very program of God you see there is a program of God with you God has a program with you and the purpose of the devil is to cut it off the first thing was the issue made by Pharaoh but they would throw all the children male children born of the Hebrews in the river and drowned them think of it that same lizard eyed devil oh yes how about back there in the beginning as soon as sudden sin that through that righteous seat sit down anyway through Abel was going to come out of the to come out of the redeemerable quickly he went to work to destroy that person too that God was going to use have you heard what I was saying whenever the devil says that God is going to use from the moment when they are babies it never begins to try and cut off the program of God it is the one who was trying to kill Moses the one who was trying to drown him why because you've seen the program of God with the life of Moses in the same way not families that died he was in the beginning he saw the plugin of God and now the Redeemer was going to come through immediately that God was going to use it no wonder your life Hallelujah man I wanted to remember about your life from the time you were a baby the devil has been at your case some of you even had ever tried witchcraft and he will try something to take away the joy of the Lord out of your life and he will throw things at you to try and kill you but let me tell you church when God has a program God thinks a program that program has to be accomplished that program cannot be cut off by soccer okay this is the devil cannot stop the program of God with your life I am really preaching to you [Music] we have to throw it back [Applause] you have sinned you have no use to pray you are not like the other one you are very bad look at yourself hey with all that you know you have done it is what is he trying to do he is throwing defeat on you he is throwing sin on you he wants you to fall down but let me tell you what does the Bible say in the book The Bible says I will look unto the Lord I will wait for the god of my salvation my God will hear me hallelujah our god will hear us whenever you come before the Lord no matter what you have done no matter what your life he has to hear you and then he says my God will hear me and then he says Rejoice not against me oh my enemy when I fall I shall rise can you put on your lips with me so when I fall I shall arise I can't hear you let's do it one more time when I fall I shall arrive some of you need to arise arise out of your situations because you are still living in your past 30 days of the voice God is fixing to do something God is fixing to move God is fixing to bless somebody God is fixing even to move in your life but he cannot bless you if you are still in your past he said when I fall I shall arise okay I shall arise when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be enlightened to me no matter where a child of God the light of God he's always in their souls even in the deepest of sins foreign they seem to reject the world but nobody can judge a saint and you are ashamed you are not a common man you're not a common woman I said you are saying why why because you are believed on the world your name your sins are out of the blood yeah stop living in your past to bless you God wants
