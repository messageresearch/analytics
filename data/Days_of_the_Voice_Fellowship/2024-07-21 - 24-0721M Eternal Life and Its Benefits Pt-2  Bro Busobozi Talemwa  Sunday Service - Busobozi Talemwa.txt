the Bible we have no membership have fellow believe that the blood of Jesus christes us from all sin of course we have no Creed but Christ amen praise the Lord okay we are going to go to the word this morning and we opening the Bibles in the Book of John chter 5 and while you are opening I'd like to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude [Music] uh to God because of Brother Martin um and um and thank you for that even before you know what I'm going to say also appreciate Brother Martin does what I cannot be able to uh we we the owner of the building is not a very easy gentleman fin I'm not saying he's a bad man I'm saying it's difficult to deal with and so seeing the flow made even if we had the money it would have been very difficult to make this without brother because he has been here for a full week he was the one with our funds protecting your funds ensuring it is not used for any other but this he's a technical person and by the way if you're building and you want painters we have Brian was here to help Brian is a professional paining work saying that he was here to and he was not paid you have not paid him so but he did it out of love out of sacrifice the body of Christ I'd like to appreciate him his family let us give the Lord so God bless you so much brother Mar your gifts to so we've spent um a total sum of um at first we spent 2.4 million and then some of that was pledged you've heard a brother saying that please fulfill your ples on our and then we also spent a total sum of 4.2 million brother was that 4.2 yes now we I have told you 5 million the good news is also God has given me some and I was able to negotiate with him I told him if you're going to spend all that money on your building we are going to pay you 700,000 inste of 800,000 per mon am and so instead of being I think we Saed about 600 700,000 so that's wonderful2 plus 2.4 how much is that don't you in Statics tell [Music] us. so we' spent 6.6 on this floor it's not our building it's G to our so uh that means brother Dan please tell me we've paid rent up to when august2 if you increase and double or triple your land fund [Music] contrib we will we can even leave here before but you up to you on how we give I see some have already begin doubling their God bless you a church with a vision vision for the souls but also we don't want to be in renting the whole time we want to have our own place if you visitor today and you intend to be fellowshipping with us please be a part of one the groups contribute we towards that effort you have little is is in it amen don't be shy and giving if that's all you have God will bless you for I believe if you you have 2,000 and you give it can't let you give it the whole time then you give 10 it begins with what you have John 54 eternal life and all its benefits this will be a part two of them verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death un life we have a request here from Sister Joan um she request that we pray for her sister what's sister's name not you not you which request is this the oh okay okay e e e is actually what happens immediately after the rupture when the rupture happens those who go in the Rapture will come before the judge seat of Christ does speak of it and I just read it to you here briefly praise the name of the Lord and many people think they confuse those two things and they think that every human being will be before the white throne and that's not true praise the name of the Lord um can you please read for for us brother Romans 14: now this is not the white Throne judgment you see many times when you preach scouching things people will tell you no don't judge me scriptures like this they say why are you judging shall all be before the white before the Judgment seat of Christ this judgment seat of Christ is not judging us to give us life or den of Life whoever will come before this judgment SE will already have previously received life are you following me now praise the name of the Lord so you see this judgment seat is like the the accountability place of what we did we live even if we we have already attained eternal life and we are children of God we saved and we have gone into the rapture it doesn't mean that God will not judge the little things that we did he will judge it so watch everything you do he an allseeing eye that watches he watches everything you do he watches everything you say the little things and the big things and all of us now here remember this scripture it was Paul speaking to the Believers and he was including himself who will come before the Judgment seat of Christ before before meaning they will stand before the Jud so they will be judged so it sounds like as if it will be the white Throne judgment will receive etal life will know but that is not speaking about that this is actually speaking about accountability we the Believers who would have gone into the Rapture stand before that judgment seat in heaven that judgment seat will be in heaven and we shall give accountability the things we were given into our stewardship I mean down even to the little things gifts that God gave you how did you use it did you use it to further the word you use it to just enrich yourself and to gratify yourself down even to you know the money you were given the money that came on your bank account brother do you use it you know when we were collecting money for buying the to do this and that you had money and you holded it and you Ed it for your other things you know all those things you know the angel of the Lord will follow it up you know down to how you spoke to your brother how you spoke to your sister how you didn't like someone very much even when they apolog to you reped to [Music] you you still that thing in your will follow that everything we do matters before the presence of everything we do will come to judgment and we shall all be judged judgment seat of Christ that judgment will not be judgment unto condemnation no it will not be judgment to either give life or deny life everyone that will be on that Jud will already have life so you see the Believers are the ones who will be judged so to be judged for what Beed into glories their life on Earth we are all not going to have the same Glory the Bible says he has vessels in his house of of less H all his even in heaven even in the rapture we will all not be having the same Glory have different levels of Glory depending on what we depending on how we when he talked of a Preacher when he reached Heaven he noticed there were crown and everybody was taking their Crown so he went for the big Crown the big shining crown told this is not yours have been a power turned many God many Souls I've had many crusades have healed a sick he said yeah that's all true but that is yours he took the little B one and it was what could fit on his he couldn't understand it and then the angel of the Lord showed said I want you to see something then there came a very old woman who was old at that time the Church of that man and this is the woman that would take the big Crown the man was confused how possible he said because every one of those exploits talking about it was because of the prayers of that she used to pray for you every day when you were on you were winning because of her prayers the things you accomplish in the because of the prayers of that woman you see now her judgment was was that she would take the bigger Shining not the preacher so the things you do matter before God you see at this moment not the debate or the conversation our conversation now is not about whether we shall make you to the Rapture or not that is not the conversation as long as you are a Believer as long as you have received the Holy Spirit it is a must for you to go to the here is what Glory will you have the Bible also speaks about those who will turn men to righte they will have a lot of shining stars in their so you see the glories will be different just like you see in the church our glories are different another all God someone sweeps the church you know someone speaks to the people another one plays the music what Glory do you want to have when you I don't know about you but I want to be closest to the I want to have a bigger shining CL there is anything we should fight for is that bigger shining Crown we are not looking how much Glory we shall receive on us amen pay attention to what I'm saying please many people when they do something for God looking for Glory you know I am the one who did that I am the one who did that the one who did that even you see brother one who gave him that nectar I am the one who bought him those shoes is actually without me is nothing you see I've taken all the glory and you know the brother is feeling small but let me tell you friend of course I didn't buy those things for you praise the name of the Lord but even if I did I want the glory to be up there whatever you are doing for the Lord you may not be thanked like sister she never spoken about you know many times she takes these curtains and you know makes them beautiful puts them back up never paid never talked about her glories will be found you may be the person will see the flowers D and will take it upon yourself says I want to be the one take care of all the flowers I want to be the one you may never be paid but you consist do it every day every week every week and when you get over there your glories will be our glory is in heaven we are working for to attain That Glory our payment is in heaven praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord but now I want us to see there is also what we call the white Throne judgment and the white Throne judgment will also consist of those that will get life having not previously attained it okay but now those who have or going Rapture they Attain life before they go in the rapt are you hearing me if you're hearing me say Amen they attain life before they go int how do they attain life there is only one sour of Life remember that is God own life someone one time told me oh some people will go in Hell Fire burn forever for eternity but you see a prophet teaches us there won't be an eternal tell your neighbor there is noal if there is etal it means they are also having some source of eternal life but those who go to hell would have been denied life so they will go to hell because they don't have eternal life and after they go to hell they burn forever and ever I want you to remember one thing everything that was created will have an end hell was created hell will have an end they may burn for zillions of years they will burn for a very long time but you see at the end of it all will do away with hell because those who have eternal life not go to hell only one source of eternal life Jesus the son in that office you know the Bible says that he will have an end and you hear the people who believe the Trinity they teach Jesus as the Eternal Son of God the Son of God had a beginning in terms of his had a beginning will surely have an End Amen when he has put all enemies under his feet he himself subject to the father become subject to the father become subject to the father like when when you subject to someone it means you are under them and they over you all right yeah that's that's a good interpretation so now we see that we are not going to have an eternal son there is only one source of etal that SCE of eternal life is God Eternal God the Eternal life and he gives it to as many that will believe my you know this is a big thought and if you can be able to move with me avoid distraction stick in the service listen to everyone while you're filtering it in your spirit I'm sure this will be a blessing to praise the name of the Lord and also pray for my interpreter amen all right so I want you to follow closely you see that this life is the life of God this life does not end and all those who will get life will also be a ET like God they will never come to an end how do we get eternal life we only get eternal life by faith neighbor we get eternal life by not by works did somebody get it not by work I realize many even in the message preach the message of Works our message is not the message of work it is the message of faith and Grace and I want you to understand the prophet said Grace not disgrace because you see this grace when having attained Grace but you are not able to walk within the Realms of that Grace I want us to understand what is Grace Grace is unmerited favorited but it is given to you we were all born in sin we were born without etal life but God are you following because of his love we read that last Sunday so Lov let us start over again for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but oh my if you got it say Amen so you see now how are we going to get eternal life working I worked fin no it is not your doing if it is your doing Christ died in vain but it is his doing why when he gave Christ Jesus Christ came down on Earth he came to purchase life eternal life all the backl sons of God and the price he paid them and redeemed them back into their original position they were now in the hands of but he came and presented the payment and he said here is the payment these are redeemed Satan cannot keep them you cannot hold them set them free and you know when he died he began with a thief Hallelujah the thief was purchased hallelujah amen amen amen and then straight away he went down into hell and he found all those were kept there them boys here to open for you there was there the was there they were all opened for he said it's time for me to take you to another place where I take those that have eternal life and he open for them and from that time everyone who received eternal life not die and go to hell die and go to heaven in a place in a dimension amen of paradise where all those who died in Christ and the Bible says how will the Rapture be all those who are dead in Christ all those who have ET before they shall resurrect they will come out of that Dimension physically they will come here and pick up their bodies we shall see and then shortly before we will also be changed be changed meaning we shall put off these bodies and we will wear our bodies that cannot die that disapp and I am waiting for that and then we meet them and together we will be raptured away and we go in heaven to the marriage supper of the Lamb I don't know all the events in heaven but I tell you some he said when we reach heaven we shall have the marriage supper you remember he told them this fruit of the Vine I'm not going to drink with you again here but when we go over there we drink again that's when that will happen of the praise the name of the Lord and then before that know there will be a judgment seat of Christ maybe there will be other events maybe he also has surprises for us only know what is revealed to us in but many more he has not told us we are in for some wonderful time we are waiting for that rather just be there be there amen if you like party just get there shall party we have a wonderful time when we go over there praise the name of the Lord but all those who will go there are the ones who will receive eternal life say for God so loved the world that he gave only begotten God I'm burning with this re says he gave his only begotten why a begotten son because his first begotten son was compromised by Satan When sin came in Satan compromised Adam the first so God said I'm going to send the the same way I sent the first the first came by the spoken and sat compromis the second also came by the spoken word she was not born he was not born by a woman by the lust of the flesh know that he was born out of the mouth of God he was a spoken word and Adam the second came on One mission to redeem ad the first amen it used to be those movies we used to watch oh now I I am looking back and never watch those movies again you know they used to portray America a super power I know many of you watch those rainbow movies and and they would say you know when an American is somewhere in a concentration camp and now the president of America an attack on one American is an attack of all they risk all the resources go and redeem that one Amer and they would go and redeem that oh my and then they show that they have the power let me tell you all those things are depicting Our God Amen ad the first attacked by the kingdom of dark God the father of could create Adam the second by the spoken word Adam the the second is Mission to come and redeem come and bring back the first Jesus came he was the second the B say the second what did he come to do listen down on Earth Amen to beat every Power of to break all right now don't Focus brother you distracting me now listen don't focus on this listen you see when he came down you know he came down right into the real what what do we call it we call it the the the kingdom of darkness Satan had put his barric everywhere all his generation was when Jesus came down again who was Jesus ask your neighbor who was Jesus who was Jesus come on neigh tell you who Jesus Jesus was the second he had the same gen like God just like the first Adam also the first Adam he was now compromised and he needed be redeemed so when Jesus came he came to break into the ranks of the enemy am a man called wiling have you ever heard about him a man of switzland when I was in swizerland I asked the brother where's that story where did it happen another place he was a man of when the men came down to attack their place were small people with small maybe wooden Spears and so you know the enemy to attack and they knew they would not defeat fearful to go and then he came and told them fellow countrymen we are not going to accept be taken over by the foreign man the foreign man will come take over our women our children some of them we are not going to per we are going to die amen trying to redeem our country and that manold you know he went and cry great entered into the enemies and they killed him like many Spears it all he went where the war was hardest where it was tightest because they all those Spears and they pierce him through and the man di shouting happening all the other men women they got the strength andage if we could do that we can do that so they all came like a SW and they came upon these people and you know what they defeated them and Switzerland switzland since has been the most peaceful country on Earth because of that but listen we are Uganda but we not ug of nation that was defeated once but one time when Jesus came he was our anold and he came shouting you know when he was on the cross you know [Music] he they pierced should but when we

the blood can change your destiny blood you eternal life life is in the blood nothing but the blood J Oh Glory to God friends we see that when Jesus shed his blood and then he says whosoever will believe Hallelujah not whoo that will go to church every Dayo will dress very well whoo will have will not get married not whosoever will behave very well will never do any bad thing in their life are you hearing but whoever that we believe Hallelujah woo amen when Paul and Silas in prison they met that prison man and he wanted to kill himself thinking they have escaped but he did not know the power of the blood come down to redeem the ones who were in prison when Paul and silus was in prison the blood followed them do you know blood follows you do you know blood is powerful when killed AB Abel went under the soil but his blood spoke blood spoke what about the blood of Jesus if you are in prison the blood can speak for you the blood spoke and when Paul and silus were there the blood came the blood s an Angel and the angel of the Lord came and overshadow the prison doors and the chains which were so powerful they were broken into pieces amen and they were set free and the doors were opened the power of the blood why because these were redeemed these were saved if you are saved if you are redeemed the blood follows you all the days of your life when he says you cannot perish it means he's watching over youah hallelujah amen that's why Mah by Revelation he knew it that he said even when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be my light and David also David knew it because he said even when I walk through the Valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why because of the blood and these two were in prison but their chains broke the door open and they came out they came out and the prison God yeah that's good brother yes we are on but now we on but now this hotest the prison God said I am gone I am dead these people have escaped he did not know the blood had show amen and then at that moment right at that moment you know they appear to him they said sir don't be worried we are still here we have gone nowhere what how did you what how he said don't you we know about something we know about the you are not let me tell you if you have the power of the inside your life you cannot be understood by the you walk in another life you walk in a higher life you work in a higher life when the Cockroaches when the Cockroaches are going to their bars when the co are going to the CLS when the co are going into Propet you as a Believer you are on a higher ground there's a big difference between an eego and a cockroach we are eagles glory to God hallelujah and this man he realized these people have something he doesn't have they asked him they said what can we do said what can I do brother to be saved he always thought is what he can do but they told him listen sir believe on the Lord Jesus you are also waiting for something else that's enough that's enough amen Martin Luther had that Revelation when he said I am justified not by The Works of the Lord I am justified not by The Works of the church I am ified by Fai in Christ and now they told him believe have faith in God believe in the Lord Jesus Christ you and your house and you shall be saved and that man became a Believer he said I believe and because he believed he was baptized that same night because he believed he washed strips because he believed that he did many things to show he had believed the things we do we do them because we are believers the things we do are not the one that save us we do what we do because we are who we are can you shout hallelujah we dress right we live right because of who we are amen glory to God amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah come on shout hallelujah to the Lord [Music] Jesus and this man was later baptized that same so we baptize not because we are making you a Believer we baptize you because you are a Believer go the world preach the gospel he that what he that believeth is shall be so we don't baptize unbelievers we baptize Believers we Believers are you Believers so because you are believers we are baptized in water in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that doesn't save us what saves us is our faith in him there are some people who will go and receive eternal life having just beli not baptized are you still here that one is hard for you to say Amen it is possible to go to heaven without being baptized if you had believed I'm emphasizing Faith here so Pastor you're saying is not necessary for oh no from the cross did he have eternal life did he have eternal life okay was he baptized you are walking in your answer right if you say baptism is the only thing that makes someone a believer that man was not aie Brethren baptism is done by Believers baptism does not make Believers you do it because you are a Believer are you following the thief on the cross received eternal life because of his faith but he didn't have a chance to be baptized but if he had gone out of that cross you would have been baptized if you refuse baptism it means you not a Believer as as that in Acts chapter 19 praise God no not 19 another chapter where Peter meets Cor when he met them and these people believed and received the Holy Ghost while Peter was still preaching then he said because Peter was doubting Gentiles could believe he thought only Jews were the only ones to believe but he was shocked when he saw the Gentiles had also believed and even spoken in he was shocked he wanted to prove where he was and that's the only place in the scripture where you find a preacher asking someone to be baptized all the other places it was the believer asking to but here Peter tells them all right seeing that you have received the Holy Ghost like us put it to our test come I bapti you they didn't run away but they said we are they were in their T hallelujah hallu huj hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah come to the water they didn't say no leave us we are in the spirit BM again they did not refuse it they accepted a True Believer will believe and accept every hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah whether you feel like it or you don't whether agrees with you or it doesn't if you're a Believer you will agree with every word amen and eternal life is received on the basis of faith in the finished work of the Cross now that is for those who will receive the Rapture you have heard many people saying it doesn't matter what I do it matters what is on my heart and they after that they do every bad thing and these are the people who who are going to go on the white thr but that those words are for believers we are the ones who are supposed to say it doesn't matter what I do it matters what he did for me because after that the life anyhow will be the life of a lamb do you think it's you doing it do you think you can do righteousness H that will accept go that will make God accept no the Bible says our righteousness like filthy RS God can't be impressed by it but there something that impresses you when you accept and believe submit yourself to his word and then he will let his Spirit come in your life and that life will live the life of singing sing with me sister the things I used to do I do them you can as well sing well the things I you're not singing come on the things I used to do I do them it was a glad day again glad day glad day I was born again oh glad glad day with I Bor oh glad day when I was born it was [Music] aad the things you used to do because it's no longer you living it is Christ that lives in you the problem with Christianity many Christians try to present their Works to God many of them try hard to leave aan oh my today I'm all songs do not struggle is by faith and Grace right set your wings on the [Music] WIS there's no struggling in the Realms I'm speaking about there is no struggling you struggle because you don't believe but if you believe you will allow God to fill you with the power of the Holy Spirit and when he comes in your life whatever he says you will do the things you cannot do you will do it will be automatic hallelujah amen you struggle to go back in sin and again back and again back because you have that Spirit of the pig but when you receive the spirit of the Lamb you will just be a lamb the lamb does not struggle to create F Ru it doesn't struggle the doesn't say give me work out let me come again God give me it just leaves and E it food and E it food the word and the W just comes aut hallelujah oh my God hallelujah very very I say unto you he that hears my word believe him that everlasting life did they get it not shall get but has present tense so the person you are seeing speaking to you right now I have eternal life when the Devil Comes tell me you may go to hell because you did a mistake I tell him Sat you too late you are too late because God has already told me I have ET life I am going in the Rapture I am born again there is no way I can go into condemnation and shall not come into condemnation what is condemnation condemnation is judgment is the white Throne judgment amen they oh my God you are not getting it they that have received eternal life here now cannot come in the white thr Jud because they have already passed oh my God from from death into life so we are already in eternal life right now Pastor I can't feel it it is not felt it is believed Hallelujah am Oh Glory do you feel like a man do you feel like a woman it doesn't matter what you feel it is what you are and it's what you believe you are my God praise the name of the Lord he's already passed from death into life there is no way we can miss the Rapture if we receive eternal life now every preacher that preaches and tells people we shall all come before the white Throne Jud they are preparing people for the tribulation and it is let me tell you no matter how good a preacher is they don't have this Revelation only the message of the we oh my God hallelujah we are the only ones in the message of the all over the world there Believers all over the world they almost everywhere who believe that we will never go through the tribulation we will never miss the rapture we will never come to be judged un condemnation the white Jud and some people are like the others who receive life on the judgment on the white Throne judgment yes that's true they are there and I want to talk about them now but those are not the bride because they receive it there they didn't have it before but when they receive it that is all they receive but the bride has eternal life plus more Hallelujah you get it eternal life is given to us here on Earth I have too much but you can't take it in all in one service maybe if God gives us Grace after I just give you a little more here then we can continue on Wednesday the word of God is sweet tell your nebor the word of God iset hallelujah amen amen it is the rising of the son the prophet says he said behold I send the promise of the father upon you carry ye always the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from to show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared it with those he shared those benefits there are benefits of eternal life been received by faith listen the people who receive eternal life do not receive it by faith so there's no other benefits do you know what it means to receive or be employed with a job with a salary and benefits ask brother Andre you know salary and benefits salary and benefits eternal life and benefits so those are there also who can get salary no benefits but the bride receives eternal life and the benefits now those benefits were not only shared by Christ but shared did with us he came to redeem to bring to life those those predestinated SE that God seen before the foundation of the world and he put their names in The Book of Life and here they be on earth without a hope he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing with every [Music] predestin he did not come to share the blessing no he did not come to be the blessing but he came to share the blessing with us we had the predestin seed and he came to share the blessing with us now if the seed wasn't on us it could not leave it had to be on the earth and also dramatized Hallelujah that is why you were born by your mother and father you are not here by mistake you are not on Earth by accident you are here to share the blessing if you were not born you could not but you had to be born no matter how long that seed is kept in darkness it will come forth when the sun shines upon it what I read he sent son o n yes you see when you plant a seed in darkness it will not grow seed we common science right seed needs how many things sunlight water and moisture whatever I don't know now but the most important thing is Son and now he said this seat everybody said this seat was planted down here on Earth but when it came listen now when it came down it was buried in the soil of darkness in the world under the rulers of the powers of doing all the wicked things like all the other Paul even said however he said that we were also like them but he has redeemed us so now we wear that seed that Darkness but when he came who the son you can say son s n my God I'm just intoxicated here with this Revelation now listen here the son as you n light when it shines on the seat the seed is dramatized now when the Sun s o n yes when he Shin what did he do he came to dramatize the seed that were predestinated to also come to life I wanted to look it over in John praise the name of the Lord chapter one I believe it is vers um six there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light am the light come in the world Jo to the world the light is coming they say the light of the Sun the light the sun same let Earth receive her King there was a man sent from from God whose name was John he came to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he oh Hallelujah believing can now come it can now come when the light has he was not John was not the light but he was sent to Bear witness of the life John the Baptist was a messenger he was Elijah William Bram was a messenger he was Elijah William Bram was not the light but William Bram was sent from God to Bear witness of the life that was the True Light which lights every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him it was him in the beginning who said let there be light and now it was him here who came again in the world he was the light the light came from him so he was the light and he came in the world but the people love the darkness more than the light he came unto his own and his own received him but as many has received him to them gave him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name not to them that do this and this and this to them that believe he has given power Hallelujah in our generation he has sent us a prophet messenger with message of restoration back to the Bible back to the foundations amen the messenger was not the light but the messenger was a witness of the light we don't follow William we follow Jesus Christ William Bram was a star that La us that showed us Jesus Christ and by following him F that star we found Christ and when we find Christ we are right here with him he's the light of the world all ye Saints of light Proclaim Jesus the light of the world M am Mery in his name Jesus come on everybody now the we walk we walk in the light beautiful light come where the drop Mery a bright shine around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world so you see he came to bear witness of the life and William's message actually it has presented to us Christ and now this Christ whoever believe in will not perish and has been given power to become a son we talked about the first Adam the second Adam so now they other sons who have eternal life what happened the death of Jesus Jus on the was able to redeem every Fallen Son of [Music] God listen to this listen to this portion from thean church age brother Dixon listen very carefully the visible manifest ations of what I have been telling you are seen all around us already the visible manifestations of what I've been telling you are seen all around us The ecumenical move of the tears is frur but also it is a fact that the prophet of the last age must be bringing forth a message from God that will for the second coming of the Lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back the P father have your hearts been turned have you seen the messenger have your hearts been turned have you received a messenger have you believed on the message your hearts have been turned you believe the truth church and with the restoration of the word will come with the restoration of the power that is a benefit others will simply get the life in the last nothing more but we we receive life and the all benefits once again I've not been able because of time to go through the other groups because I feel is more exciting to talk about the bride and the benefits that we have shall we stand on our feet preaching 17 years I've learned that it's not finishing a someone that does it it's what God has done and I sure believe

me God be with you we before before before the People March out please um we we've just concluded uh brother aa's wedding you're supposed to be interpreting for me that microphone I think you to switch it on [Music] and I appreciate people who accept to obey the Holy Spirit when he speaks I love people who submit themselves to the Holy Spirit when he speaks so God spoke to brother Andrew to remind me of something very important you know when when we are in the presence of God everything like is all in order she makes no mistakes amen so wanted us to be reminded about sister pe's wedding um first of all I'd like to appreciate those who Isaac and charity being with young people have learned um when someone does something before another does it the one who has not yet done will see a lot of loop holes and mistakes and errors in what the other has done and will think me I'll be much better but I believe that's what even the Holy Spirit was trying to speak to us today we should humble ourselves and we should love one another support one another do we understand what I'm saying brother Andrew did his wedding some supported some did not shame same thing now Isa and now it is peace but the trend that I see regardless of what anybody says what there is one Trend that I have seen that God has been with us in all those weddings [Applause] some attended this wedding and some did not attend the other wedding but God attended all and as your pastor I can tell you God has been behind all those [Music] marriages regardless of your opinion or person opinion God is God is God by himself he does what he wants to do and no man there questions him and so at this time the next wedding is that of sister peace uh the wedding is is it 31st August and unless they changed but the last conversations we had was it's going to happen in uh so that means is one of us of course we have to stand with behind as we have stood with all the brothers uh we've been taking people's girls it is now time for us to give also and we have to do it with one heart amen so I I think I would like maybe the deacons will work on that together with a piece and a fiance so that we try to arrange uh on that day you know a car uh that will take as many you can find a car and find out how much it will cost next Sunday you can announce so that people who want to go can be bringing each the amount can be divided if 200,000 and there 14 people how much is that 14 you you're offline he has been interpreting so it's offline someone who is good in math 15 so you see if we using a taxi I'm just saying if it is 200,000 I don't know how much it is so but I believe you can begin preparing at least a minimum of 50,000 to go and come 60 70 around there to go and come back so plan around 70,000 plan it it is next month around the end of next month yeah and then they will inform us the exact amount later so we go and support sisterpie number number two they still need money also in their wedding let us give and give generously you know if you really love your brother or your sister and they struggling they're having a wedding not easy you give and give as if you're supporting your own wedding and when you do that you will realize that God will also open other doors for you I believe that so shall we do that church they have a group also and they collecting money go on that group pleas make sure that group is posted again on the church group if you're not on the church WhatsApp group you are not serious if you have a smartphone so please go on the chch WhatsApp group because we announce sometimes like when we were renovating here we announced no service on Wednesday some brethren came and some of them are on the WhatsApp group what does it show they archived it they don't read what goes on there it's not a good thing you should always be active on your church group what if the rapt is announced there be up to date on your WhatsApp and also when you see a text sometimes I send sometimes Deon send sometimes other don't just be quiet some people go in the ventilators always be active people like brother Alan he answers every text whatpp you should even CL for him he a very good example yes yes it means he serious with the things of God and others you know yourselves who answer but those on who are the venators you also know yourselves it's not a good thing and then you are the one when you post something you want everybody to say oh thank you wonderful amen and when they don't answer you say they don't love me please answer those messages so sister post that link again and and um the people will join your group because we don't want to make the church group beginning collecting this collecting that they have their owning group join it and give there I'm
