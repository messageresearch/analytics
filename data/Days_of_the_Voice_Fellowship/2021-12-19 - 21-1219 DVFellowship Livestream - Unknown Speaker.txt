shall enjoy this for yourself praise the name of the lord hallelujah i'm waiting for the people to settle in those who have not yet settled in now [Music] i just want to greet each and every one of you in the name of jesus those who are visiting with us today i think i can only see one is there anyone else who is visiting here the first time oh oh sorry can you greet us let me give you an opportunity to greet us one by one just stand and tell us your names where you're coming from and then we can go to the next [Music] okay [Applause] you're welcome um [Applause] ah man brother what's the name god bless you you're welcome see another young man here i know it's not your first time to be here yes all right you're welcome god bless you that's uh joey's brother okay sister christine brother simon brother joseph feel at home you're welcome and in this place we do not have any laws but we only have love we don't have another book but we have only the bible as our absolute and so we we also don't demand membership from people we only have fellowship in this place and we believe in the blood of jesus washing us from every sin and so uh by god disgrace i'm the pastor of this leader fellowship and uh so this morning you are not going to be hearing from myself but you'll be hearing from another minister in this church by the martin you will be ministering the word of god and so here we give uh time to the word of god because we believe that the word is what will transform us everything you know healing miracles signs wonders prosperity all those things are good but they do not transform your soul you see your soul just like your flesh needs food to eat like your flesh needs muguyo posho matoke and things like that chicken oh you cannot leave the chicken out brother and so so you know your flesh needs all those things to be able to to to grow in the same way your soul also needs the word of god to be able to grow and so here we give time to the word of god and actually most of the time in the fellowship we usually give it to the word of god and because we believe we surely need it to be able to be transformed into the image of jesus christ and so before we go into the changing of all of the service i just wanted to give the update regarding our land contribution fund i know that there are those who are continually uh being faithful in giving towards their their pledges and this sunday only about three brother sam brothers and brother sister grace and and sister kavatoro have been able to fulfill their pledges i think that is november but assam has fulfilled this november pledge since the grace greatest how november pledge for week one and then sister cavatoro had december pledge so we have now a total of 4.932 so we are almost hitting five millions amen and uh we are looking for 150 million to buy land for the cabinet that seems like ah you're still far but look two months ago we had it so if you hold your hands and say maybe let god come and help us he will not come he will not come but now we can say god is already helping us and we are progressing amen from 115 million we are all we are about to hit to knock the 5 million out and how many will be remaining the good mathematician 245 so we are going we are moving forward and so some of you i know there are some that someone who was streaming the other day and wrote me and said we are praying for you for your church land so whoever that wants to contribute don't only pray don't only pray prayer is good and important it's prayer that is going to lead us through this but if you can give towards that noble cause that would be wonderful people when people die people are rushed to contribute they can even contribute in just one hour because of someone who is dead but in this case we are contributing for a even a better cause even a better cause because we are going we are actually also contributing for the those ones who die to the world and are alive in jesus christ to be able to meet in one place and glorify the living jesus christ amen so it's a noble cause god will bless you as you continue to fulfill your pledges so uh shall we [Music] sing one song as we give our offerings and take this and then after that our advice is that we need to sing a special song as the minister comes so for now let us done and then brother [Music] so let's pray for the those who are going to for the offerings father in the name of jesus we want to take this moment to appreciate you lord because you have allowed us to be in your house today father as we shall be giving our

may you bless us bless the those who are going to also give the of the substance that you have given to them may you open more windows and channels of blessings for them to be able to serve you even in a much much better way lord as each of us give our heart to you this morning i pray that you will give us let us have soft hearts for your world just come and have your way with us we have new people brethren brothers and sisters from different places others are here for their first time lord i know that that place is a burden on the minister in order for him to hear from you that you'll be

and here i have i will be today i'll i have uh quotes and we have heard so much about raid so much about preachers have preached on uh since the beginning of time of it through the ages prophets for told it four thousand years before it ever happened [Music] when it did happen when it did happen um it is such an important day that's why we are gathering the devil naked praise be to god i mean the bible tells us that we shouldn't comfort our one another with this word [Applause] many times we take things for granted [Music] it is because of being alive [Applause] [Applause] i want to talk about that what happened that day on calvary it is one of the most important day of all the days that god ever let down on us it is so important for human race amen i think it is good for us to go back and examine and see just what it means to us erando [Music] [Applause] and see what it means to us i'm sure that this late hour that we are living we are seeking every importance of god that we can know [Applause] do we believe that the church god's judgment is soon striking [Applause] i'm sure in this late hour that we are leaving we are seeking every importance of god that we can know he studied and meditate he's not the minister said and meditates in the scripture seek for inspiration it is because he is a public servant to god these people travole and i pray that it will uh call uh that culver mental okay uh okay i pray that it will condem every sinner that is present [Applause] that will make every sick person rise his faith to god [Applause] this morning [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] he never told us that one man will make you say it after you are dead yes but when he went to california again we became saints amen i mean that one great important thing that galbraith means to us calvary settled sin question once remember the bible says at the bible the song that's in the shall die and we have been uh sharing pastors and sharing with us about the tree of life about the voice of the blood at the muslim side praise be to god i mean all those things were typing calvary church furniture calvary and that's why jesus had to come here it was a shadow of the perfect one which was to come as your child you found foreign us we cannot we have nothing to do praise be to god so man was chained in sin yes is [Applause] of sin was tense praise you to god come here amen i mean and remember sin did not start on us the devil was condemned creature the devil was condemning preacher for his disobedience before ever struck the earth where god puts the angels and so forth upon the same places that he put human being on where a man could take his choice and when lucifer was given the preeminence to make his choice he wanted something better than god had oh questions nina and when sin struck the earth back in the beginning like a sheet of black falling from the heaven [Music] everything is decided i started to develop that self-defense mechanism it through every creature on earth thing and we were set here hopeless because every creature on earth was subject to it everybody was under bondage nobody could redeem the others praise be to god man could not redeem his fellow man [Applause] [Applause] when he was called to go out into the place which issued after receive for inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing where he went whose foundation was uh build up and make her is god [Music] that day being so important remember i told you where we read that quote about he was talking about the condition let us look at what we ought to do for that day that's what we have to know that price that we should look into it for a great day the greatness of all the dead seas price was settled and saturn's power was broke um [Music] position before your faith praise be to god come here creatures have preached about calvary valley ministers of ministers of prophecy each one of us must go to california it is because they have not visited [Applause] is because upon his shoulders how he had a hip of bug on his back but that day when he met calvary his parents were lifted oh [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] the spirit of the nomination the spirits of witchcraft praise be to god if you think i'm speaking my own words the one who the commander of the demons here in buganda is a protester praise be to god do you know him [Applause] is when he died on the cross [Music] those whose names are written in the lamb's book of life to god amen amen we are not here to be recognized by a certain head of denominations foreign [Music] you may act as if you don't love them may be no more distance and then you distance from them but that baby will keep on teasing you it's just from annoying you um or breaking [Music] [Music] [Applause] praise be to foreign these things were just going to manifold so the way god purposed it now that love god could not rest praise self-esteem but it's service without that pain when you are not fair go back to you oh how i miss this fellowship because god is going to pass back up they were defeated but jesus came from glory what praise be to god that was terrible time for the devil praise be to god [Music] [Applause] [Music] what they you must recognize your day and it is messenger [Music] territory [Applause] [Music] the prophet prophesied about jesus praise be to god but that prayer had not come already studies have been made sermons have been preached amen amen so this day it do three things and if you miss it you have missed everything already this is what the nomination missed preachers have not taken people to california but we are known to point people to the names of our churches but to point them to that big church triumphantly but all of us we are a member in the body of christ what would happen to me be tuned by christian praise be to god come and give us away that newton the church is lacking today when jesus could do how to come from another therefore and when man realized that he was separated from his god he became a wanderer [Music] foreign [Music] he did not know they could not go back to god he became lost he didn't know which way to die just look at wandering trying to find something uh try to find something on the inside of him told him that he became uh he came from a place that was to kill perfect there is something which tells him that he came from a perfect place one way king twitch come and you have how much faith and he was longing for that you see much as we are living like we are no one commanded to remove that deep inside our heart brother sister we are not content something is telling us that there is something much better than what we are doing you cannot deny that even a fifth one is stealing no more people have a bad inside [Music] he cannot help himself not until jesus comes his way praise be to god amen and he says that there is not a person here in this visible audience this morning one day number 121 to know oh yeah oh here in the audience for them of the magnetic tape where it goes around the world he's saying that uh here but he says that we see sorry uh go around the world there is no one here on oh oh anywhere but what sink but what seeks for the perfection you get bills paid you think it's certain when you get your bill paid then there is somebody sick in your family oh amen when the signal gets all right then you got more bills to pay attack and you see the first thing you know you are standing great you have pursued books or some editable until you are called the books mr book and you think it is settled no other words and and nothing comes in know about where you engage yourself [Applause] constantly because of what because that wave of sin but it says but in your heart because that you seek for that it shows that there is some perfection the reason as to why the only mama of 80 years dies ahead [Music] amen amen blessed be the name of the lord that day on calvary finally one day everybody [Applause] the prophet have died by the name of jesus christ that was the day that the price was paid everybody righteousness [Music] the reason as to where jesus came [Applause] heart where

calvary don't we we believe jesus died well of course everybody's talking about his bath but if he did not die his birth would mean nothing but sure he was born we believe that but he was born to die that day on calvary and i just the brother mentioned and talked about him christ divorcing all denominations and you know he's not coming back for any denomination he died and rose again so that we may be prepared to go and meet him in the air he's coming for those that he died for not for the nominations not for the churches he's coming for the days of the voice fellowship baptist church that is just not nothing he doesn't even know catholic church he doesn't even know uh whatever you want to call it he is coming for his bride who has no spot and who has no dream the bible says he's coming for a glorious church hallelujah how many believe that with all their heart amen he's coming for glorious church can we sing that song before we go a glorious church a glorious church without spot or wrinkle and i love this so very much and uh while we are saying this song if there is anyone who wants to give their life to jesus and you've never done that we want to invite you to come walk slowly and come here so we can pray with you amen [Music] okay we shall start with the first stanza i know some of you don't know it but it's a very very beautiful song and stick with some with some strength

in uganda and also in english so make sure you go out with a copy at eight at eight pm especially the younger people that have that usually attend the bible study i expect you to be at my house i don't know how you will sleep you will sleep sitting there the whole night but anyways just come we shall have because we're having a youth meeting i don't want only to preach to those who are approached i also want to help the representative here okay the young people if you can make it you are welcome at my house at exactly 8 00 pm tonight praise the lord how many have been blessed by the message let us give a lot of crap for praise if you have been blessed amen amen let us pray precious loving jesus we want to thank you so much this evening lord it's been a wonderful day wonderful morning that you have given to us there's no better day that that we can have than the day when we are talking about what happened on the cross father it is because of the cross that we are christians it's because of the cross that we can meet like this and people are meeting everywhere it's because of what was done on the cross and lord we know and realize that many people don't even realize that they do not respect that enough to know that you came from glory and as the preacher said it wasn't just another person that came but it was the very person the god who created heaven and earth that great spirit the bible calls the spirit in the book of john chapter 4 verse 24 god is a spirit jehovah god you came down and you condescended yourself in a form of a man you put on human flesh so that you can be able to die can't the world see that this was not just an angel this was not just another body or another little somebody this was the very god who had created heaven and earth the god who said let there be and there was was the same same god that came down in the form of human flesh and the bible tells me the book of john chapter one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word put on flesh and built among us you put on flesh so that you will be able to die on that cross you put on flesh so that you will be able to bleed on that cross amen so that when they pierce your side aim and blood and water will be able to bring forth your bride your church it is because of that cross amen like the wife of adam was taken out of his side by ripping his side open even your wife the church was taken out from your side when you were ripped on your side and the blood and water gushed out that has passed the church of jesus christ and today we are here because of that blood we are here because of that blood we can even sing and say oh the blood of jesus oh the blood of jesus for it washes away all our sins and makes us free and makes us happy and has identified us to who we are this this morning father we appreciate the blood we appreciate your sacrifice lord you you you humble the bible says you were in the form of god but you you you humbled yourself into a form of a man and you humbled yourself even to die on that cross you would have called all the host of angels to come and rescue you on that cross you would have simply said michael come and show them you would have called gabriel you would have called one of the great mighty angels but you did not you did not call them because you had a purpose to be on the cross you had a reason to be on the cross and i'm glad that i can say i am that reason for you to be on the cross no matter what the devil says there is a church triumphant a church of jesus christ going to go in the rapture she will not go in the tribulation because you have died and gone through the tribulation for her and i'm so glad to be identified with that church i'm so glad to be identified with that body of christ and my brothers and sisters here lord we just pray oh god that you will help us that we should identify ourselves with without blood that blood which was straight for us oh that day on calvary what a great great day and what a great thing to talk about bless our brother and renew his strength and whenever his times again he will be a blessing to your bride father we give you all the praise and honor and glory and bless this people father for they have listened and been fed your word and now i pray for them as they go away lord may you hold them give them strength even throughout this entire week and the remainder of this year give them strength lord amen that they will be able to be bold and stunned knowing that you have fought the battle for them and you have won it lord father commit them into your hands lord and even those who came to visit us bless them father and may you bring them closer to your god i pray in the precious name of jesus [Music] one song

give it to someone who will be very fast [Music] all right [Music] all right stand up and let us sing it together [Music] [Music] we are walking up [Music] oh is [Music] [Music] a sister who has something [Music] praise the living god [Music] i love jesus too much amen for all my family i stand as a born again but they're all catholic and protestant but i've changed my mind because when jesus is coming back he will take me but when they refuse to come back to jesus christ the son of god i know my grave is different from them my children grave is different from them even when i've got married they're all catholics but i know this message it will risk to them it's the first time for my sister doctors to give me the message when she went i know where she was staying she asked to reach me i know god was already prepared the way for me through her and my family so i want to be baptized again because the first baptism it was in catholic the second baptism i made it in a certain church which is called seven days adventists but i don't believe whether they have used the true name not a title on my name on my baptism and i want to re-baptize again in the name of jesus christ [Music] [Applause] the second thing i'm giving thanks to god [Music] to bringing doctors from the route where she was lost when she was born she has not known born again what is this but i've tried with my level best to bring her back home in the hand of jesus christ so good work through me and through monica and make dr stewart where she is i thank god for giving life of doctors an easy hand and make her a good girl because if we are working with her really people see what kind of a girl is dockers you cannot compare her with the ladies out there with the young girls walking around there i thank god for pastor may the lord protect you and your family may the hand of the lord really i'm very happy to continue keeping you and your family and they all church i know this is my church but i'm staying far you pray for me and my husband a lot is in training to go to somalia i want you to dedicate him in the hand of god pastor i love you all i love god i love jesus christ i love the children of god i like being born again i thank you praise the lord she was born again before her in the yeah before you and she was uh you know ready knowing jesus in another level but now she tried to show her the way with monique i'm told and now when she came again she passed and then when she passed now she's again going back and showing her by the way there is something missing here i know she's realizing hey we love the way god god the way god works is amazing amazing and you see if you love him he has to continue revealing himself to you you know if you love god without your heart it doesn't matter what you believe he reveals more of himself to you but the more you love him amen the bible speaks of one uh i think that he was a sister someone would remind i think she was a sister priscilla sister priscilla was with her husband um what was the name of her husband aquila and so they went somewhere and they found a preacher preaching in power and anointing and this man was full of revelation but he did not have the full message of the hour because he did not he knew jesus but he did not know him the way the priscilla and the pillar knew him he did not have the full revelation so priscilla and aquila told him and when he received it the bible says that they showed him the scriptures and were able to bring the word of the hour to him so i'm sure that maybe some of you who you could not jesus but you see at what level do you know him amen you may know him but you have to know him at the level of the day that you are living in and now we have known him and i want to sing the song as we go we have known him in his name in the power of his name we are the people of his name you know that you see others may know him as a friend as a hero as this as that as a uh one that gives them prosperity as one that gives them miracles signs and wonders as that oppressor is wonderful but you should know him in the power of his name and his name is the one that through his name we receive salvation of our souls that's why even in water baptism we baptized in his name the name of our lord and savior jesus christ the bible says there is no salvation in any other name if i had time i would preach another someone but i know you are tired you all want to go so let us just sing one song and if there is anyone with a question sister i don't know when you're ready for water baptism but uh we'll talk to you and we'll be able to have some time with you and then we can plan well to uh maybe in the course of the week or on wednesday whichever we can uh have you be baptized as soon as you are ready we are ready hallelujah amen do you have a song i know we sing this song many times but i love it so much there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all aflame with a fire that fell at pentecost which cleans that made them clean it is burning now within my heart all glory to his name i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them and give me the next stanza it says that's a chorus brother it says though though these people may not learn be no most of what they fame we may not say we are so famous but they are they have received their pentecost pentecost is the holy spirit they are baptized in jesus name oh no one is by praising just name here and i'm telling now both far and wide you see we are here but also this is on the internet it's going all over the world and there are many all over the world like us they are telling that his power is yet the same and i'm so glad i was preaching that his power of hearing his power thing that is all the same like it was then on the cross and i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them there are people almost it is we're one of them [Music] one of them [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] i'm so glad that i can [Music] [Music] i can say i'm one of [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen to this now come my brother seek this question somebody tell somebody come on tell somebody oh glory to his name i'm so glad that i can say one of them [Music] why don't [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] are you one of them [Applause] [Music] i don't [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am going to see the king [Applause] [Music] [Music]
