he's standing with us are you happy to be a believer tonight amen hallelujah there are many who doubt this message that this message is the truth there are many people today [Music] one of the things that's seeking for Vindication is whether the message is [Music] searching for Vindication and they're trying to discredit the message in any ways vindication it was in the days of foreign Singapore foreign praise God Lord today I want to give you I want to demonstrate by the spirits of this message to prove to him you better be perfect so when we talk about the infallible praise God and debatable Vindication that is perfect that is foreign [Music] praise God hallelujah hallelujah if you receive the word tonight I have a little time but I'm determined to you know bring these things amen amen I I believe that God has and had this in mind for me to bring it to you and in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ and what she is and what she stands foreign [Music] she will be an invisible praise God hallelujah if we know who he is in finding the infallible I'm going to show you by the way that the devil has always tried search for Vindication prove to me did not say it is the Lord Jesus Christ yourself again he said unto him all these things [Music] the devil Saturn was not resting foreign foreign [Music] the devil neither this is that Jesus never needed yes it is always certain words the Bible says he signs so for them that believe me praise God but they are not believes signs of foreign think about it for a moment if Jesus wanted to do it because he didn't even take a second he would perform all the time for him to be Vindicated he had the power Simba he had the power but he couldn't produce them [Music] Hallelujah he couldn't do it without doubting the word himself if Jesus did it it means he had doubted who he was because he had done it do you realize Jesus was the word himself I will not give it to you that is what Jesus was saying he knew who he was in the message of wisdom versus Faith listen be very attentive I know you are well taught here God drop this inspiration for this church and so I I have no iota of doubts foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign Shanda foreign that's why I never feel don't sucker so discouraged because they know it but by wisdom it is foreign everything so say I said there is your perfect communication everything that was about him and then one day praise the name of Allah hallelujah amen I want you to see this one is John and his disciples seeking for vindication we see that I just read for you a portion he says when John had had in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples [Music] or do we look foreign these were Disciples of John and they came back in the name of John because John was in prison this is the same man and John came in a place where he was now is he the one yeah and he sent two of his decisions foreign [Music] foreign praise God hallelujah oh God are you leading us this way that is your mind to receive this message of his resurrection hallelujah praise God Amen and Jesus you know however I want to say this is so gracious when the Disciples of John came on behalf of John you know what it is he was ready to tell them who he was he was ready to do that but you would think he would sit them down Jesus answered and said unto them yes okay in those things there are people out there who are not unbelievers but they are not part of us genuine you don't need a Vindication that is in the same Jesus signs and wonders Jesus are you here today and you want to see something Hallelujah are you here today are you here today and you want to hear something praise the name of the Lord I can say we are all believers who are not yet sorry the Believers who is going to do it [Music] it is us through us that they will be able to see Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God Amen listen he's infallible way indicating himself what was his way of indicating himself he didn't explain he was trying to show them The Interpreter of the message foreign [Music] praise God hallelujah hallelujah that's how we've been together by manifestation demonstration [Music] [Music] that he is alive is Undisputed it is perfect the devil could not look to Jesus I don't believe it Jesus would be like yes or not you don't believe it yourself myself praise God you give that to the devil and it is fully disowned this manifestation of the sons of God these vindication you give it to the devil and you are fully disappointed this will do maximum damage this is the greatest one lukewarmness not hot not cold in the middle um we don't want to be lukewarmed we want to be the church the devil Satan will want you to be a believer but he will not allow you to manifest that life because that's the only thing that can disarm him a manifested life if you have your Bible turn with me to Malachi chapter 5. you know this message Malachi and I want to say we have a message let me say this in here it's a vindication that the prophet was a man of God and there are many people who will try to take themselves and then they say you see this is all right because we see we believe foreign [Music] foreign [Music] so now my question is [Music] is you foreign [Music] [Music] the devil can't say anything foreign foreign Hallelujah in the message then Jesus came and called The Prophet says who has the spirit the fruit of the spirit says not speaking in times [Music] what is the evidence what is the evidence he says the evidence of the word [Music] foreign why are you here because God had the mind for this church why are we as the bride of Christ we are here as the answer from the minds of the devils in our generation let me tell you I've seen God change lives I tell you that is Hallelujah I was meant to be a priests but why am I here where am I shouting Prince is not supposed to shout please why am I here [Applause] why are you here in the people that God will call in every generation has shined in our generation Hallelujah when did the message start here in this country 19. 1975. 1975 they were Believers of this message 2013. 13 there was no believe foreign [Music] foreign [Music] of this message let me tell you the good message is more than a movement foreign [Music] in your womb by the way we have had many testimonies foreign foreign what happened someone with authority exercise when you stand on the road a police officer just does like this is that is exercising Authority and we as Believers of this noise and when we walked into that hospitals say Lord Jesus yes you've sent us a message and you say it in your words [Music] I pray for my brothers the man who was only born walked out of that hospital he was on oxygen but he walked out totally healed and as he was he told the people I don't want to go in a car I want to walk down to the church it was maybe about 10 kilometers [Music] [Music] Hallelujah the chief in the village and we still preach the message there and they have been been baptized over the years this message when you receive it you become the vindictive hallelujah praise God I want to reach a closing moment and I want to say this the Bride of Jesus Christ to fulfill everything was written about sources just like Jesus said that was written about it where it is becoming inhabitable it is Sodom again sin will increase [Music] around some people who are going to try and overcome it try to do something to run away you've heard what is happening in our country they're trying to put up the anti-homosexuals do you think we can fight sin by Allah I appreciate what our country is doing it sin foreign I am going to overcome the chakunda the bride must live in Hawaii the bride must conquer this is quite loud this year the bride manga must overcome I don't know about you but I know I'm the bride and I'm the Vindication if the devil is doubting this is the message is foreign [Applause] it will not stop God that have been changed zero to say that it is the Bride of Jesus thank you Hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen one of the brothers can give us the song we've got the power in the name of Jesus just listen to these words the prophet says and if you can't accept the whole word of God the way it is written you wouldn't do it there don't worry you won't be there ago but the bride accepts the whole world you've got to accept it of what it is I'd like to pray before I invite the pastor if there is somebody here with a real name I'm not going to pray the bride is going to pray foreign [Music] let us sing that chorus [Music] ES [Music] he cannot be defeated [Music] In The Name Of The Lord [Music] has got the power of God [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] whatsoever [Music] [Music] [Applause] the power of the name of Jesus [Music] defeated with God [Music] In The Name Of The Lord while we are going to pray now we believe all the vindications prove to us they believe that is that this message is to prove to us and God sent us all of them we believe the clouds good question God is just reminding us tonight that you have love for one foreign Hallelujah and
