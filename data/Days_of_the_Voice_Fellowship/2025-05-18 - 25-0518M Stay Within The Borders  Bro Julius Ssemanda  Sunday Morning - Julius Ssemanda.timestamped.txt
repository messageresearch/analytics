[15:22] Let's have ourselves some of prayer. Hol
[15:25] dear Lord Jesus Christ in the cover of

[15:33] Lord Jesus, we commit ourselves, our
[15:36] ways, oh father, Lord Jesus, our souls
[15:39] and our ways of speech. Our father, we
[15:41] all commit unto thee, Lord Jesus. For we
[15:44] know that, Lord Jesus, you died on the
[15:46] cross and was for once and for all, Lord
[15:48] Jesus, that our sins were forgiven and
[15:50] you paid the debt. Lord Jesus, now as we
[15:53] gather in this place today, we come to
[15:55] hear from thee, Lord. We come to ask
[15:57] forgiveness, for mercy, that Father,
[16:00] even as we move in this world which is
[16:01] so wicked, that we may have your grace
[16:04] and mercy moving with us day and night,
[16:07] guiding us day and night, oh Lord Jesus
[16:09] Christ, we commit our ways and call even
[16:11] this Sunday. We commit to us, Lord,
[16:14] bless the servant that you're going to
[16:15] use. Father, anoint him with your word
[16:18] that father may speak not parties of his
[16:20] own but father that which you have put
[16:22] in his. We commit even all the hearers
[16:25] Lord Jesus. Let us hear that word and

[16:30] as we go in this world. We commit even
[16:32] all the tithes and offerings Lord Jesus
[16:34] that your children are going to give. Oh

[49:27] The song is called Belie Becomes My
[49:29] Victory.
[49:34] [Music]
[49:48] It's not hard to believe.
[49:54] Standing on the mountain of glory.
[50:00] [Music]
[50:05] When you can hear the songs of
[50:10] angels and the grace from heaven sends
[50:14] your
[50:15] spirit
[50:22] sorry but in the
[50:25] valley once
[50:27] more when Jesus still
[50:31] behold that still
[50:41] believing when the
[50:43] living isn't
[50:46] easy. That is the testing.
[50:52] [Music]
[50:55] And I need faith for the
[51:00] time. When the sun does not
[51:04] shine and the mountain top is just a
[51:10] memory when there's no sign to be
[51:16] seen and I don't feel a
[51:20] thing to the word of God alone. I must
[51:26] claim and I need strength for the
[51:32] day when troubles come my
[51:36] way and I just don't
[51:40] understand what it
[51:44] means. That's when nothing else we do.
[51:49] Faith alone will see me
[51:52] through.
[51:54] Unbelieving becomes my
[51:57] [Music]
[52:04] victory. It's not hard to
[52:09] believe where things are going. There is
[52:12] sky for sunny.
[52:17] [Music]
[52:20] When you feel you're making
[52:24] progress, doing
[52:26] good. Living in the time of
[52:35] plenty. But if all of that should
[52:40] change, would you still keep the faith?
[52:44] That's the question.
[52:47] [Music]
[52:52] Don't
[52:53] believe when the living isn't
[52:58] easy. That is the testing.
[53:03] [Music]
[53:06] And I need faith for the
[53:11] time. When the sun does not
[53:15] shine and the mountain top is just a
[53:21] memory. When there's no time to be
[53:26] seen and I don't feel a
[53:30] thing to the one of God alone, I must
[53:36] cling and I need strength for the
[53:42] day. When troubles come my
[53:46] way and I just don't
[53:49] understand what it
[53:53] means. That's when nothing else we
[53:57] do. Then we long we see
[54:01] food. I
[54:03] believe becomes my victory.
[54:08] And I need faith all the
[54:13] time. When the sun does not
[54:17] shine and the mountain top is just a
[54:23] memory. When there's no sign to be
[54:28] seen and I don't feel a
[54:32] thing to the one of God alone I must
[54:38] cling and I need strength for the
[54:44] day when troubles come my
[54:47] way and I just don't
[54:51] understand what it means.
[54:56] That's when nothing else we
[54:59] do. Faith alone will see me
[55:03] through. I
[55:05] believe becomes my
[55:10] victory. That's when nothing else will
[55:14] do. The world alone will see me
[55:18] through.
[55:20] Unbelieving becomes my
[55:24] [Music]
[55:26] victory.
[55:28] Unbelieving becomes my victory.
[55:32] [Music]
[55:36] [Applause]

[1:32:13] Father in the mighty name of our Lord
[1:32:15] and Savior Jesus
[1:32:17] Christ, you are the great and mighty
[1:32:20] God, the everlasting
[1:32:23] God, the God of
[1:32:26] glory, he that was and is and is
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:30] You are full of power. You are full of
[1:32:34] grace, loving
[1:32:36] kindness. Lord God, our savior, we don't
[1:32:40] come to you because we are a great
[1:32:43] people. We don't come to you because we
[1:32:46] are too many. We don't come to you
[1:32:50] because we are worthy. But we come
[1:32:53] because you bid us to come. But we come
[1:32:57] because you love us. For you said, for
[1:33:01] the Lord your
[1:33:02] God loved you with a great love.
[1:33:06] Heavenly Father, we are so glad to know
[1:33:09] that we can always come always come
[1:33:12] every time regardless of what we have
[1:33:15] done. The blood of Jesus, the sacrifice
[1:33:20] that was made as atoned for our sins. We
[1:33:24] are so glad to know
[1:33:26] that our God is in our
[1:33:29] midst. Heavenly Father will forgive our
[1:33:33] sins which we have committed in
[1:33:36] words and in deeds and in our thoughts.
[1:33:41] And if there be
[1:33:43] anything that may hinder you this
[1:33:45] morning to move to touch every
[1:33:49] individual, take it out of the way. May
[1:33:52] you cleanse us Lord by the blood of
[1:33:55] Jesus. May you show your divine
[1:33:58] love, your grace upon each one of
[1:34:01] us. Heavenly Father, let this morning
[1:34:06] all through the
[1:34:07] afternoon. Let it be a day of
[1:34:11] reviving,
[1:34:13] restoring, blessing your people, giving
[1:34:16] them
[1:34:17] breakthroughs, granting their hearts
[1:34:20] desires, discerning the secrets of the
[1:34:23] heart. For you said in your word that
[1:34:26] the word is a
[1:34:28] discerner. Father, we may not have a
[1:34:31] gift that the prophet of the age, but
[1:34:35] you said the word is a discerner of the
[1:34:40] secrets
[1:34:41] and of the hearts. Reach out
[1:34:46] everyone. Address their
[1:34:49] need. Touch them.
[1:34:51] Lord, even as who are standing here,
[1:34:54] Lord, take us out of the way.
[1:34:57] Let it not be that man is
[1:35:00] sick but the Lord Jesus the power of the
[1:35:05] Almighty come to confirm the
[1:35:07] word. Father we can
[1:35:10] speak we can do
[1:35:12] all that but it's only you that can make
[1:35:16] this word
[1:35:18] alive. Only your holy
[1:35:21] spirit can bring the life of
[1:35:24] Christ into the hearts of these
[1:35:27] people. We be nothing but
[1:35:30] vessels that you are using this
[1:35:33] morning. Father I
[1:35:35] pray open the ears that
[1:35:38] you circumcise the
[1:35:41] lipsticks. Those that are
[1:35:44] online bless them also.
[1:35:47] Each one of us receive our
[1:35:50] portion. We are weak but
[1:35:53] thou. Lord Jesus, we bless your
[1:35:57] name. Giving glory and honor to
[1:36:00] you. We are expectant
[1:36:03] Lord. We are waiting this
[1:36:05] morning. We have not just come Lord to
[1:36:09] see a minister to see each other to
[1:36:13] support each
[1:36:14] other. We came to hear from you.
[1:36:17] Lord take
[1:36:19] over. Take over. Lord
[1:36:21] Jesus, come and do what I cannot do in
[1:36:27] Jesus Christ.
[1:36:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:36] Amen.
[1:36:40] Amen. God richly bless you.
[1:36:44] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[1:36:46] Jesus
[1:36:48] Christ. We thank God for this
[1:36:52] morning and for this
[1:36:54] time, for this
[1:36:57] hour that he has granted
[1:37:00] us. It's always a good
[1:37:03] thing, a joyous
[1:37:06] moment when we come to the house of
[1:37:09] God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Abraham
[1:37:14] said we come to
[1:37:17] church to be
[1:37:23] better. Why we come to
[1:37:25] church is to be
[1:37:29] better. He said to become better
[1:37:34] Christians, to become better
[1:37:38] citizens, to become better neighbors,
[1:37:43] to become
[1:37:47] better. That's why we come to
[1:37:50] church. After every service
[1:37:54] as we're opening numbers
[1:37:57] 35, I read verse 26 to
[1:38:01] 28. Always ask
[1:38:05] yourself, what has been added to me?
[1:38:12] Am I becoming better or
[1:38:16] not? Have I lost
[1:38:20] something? Have I lost something which
[1:38:23] wasn't
[1:38:25] good? And I'm becoming
[1:38:29] better. If you can get something
[1:38:33] small that can draw you a step closer to
[1:38:37] Christ, it's good
[1:38:42] enough. I want to use one hour
[1:38:45] only. I was looking whether there is a
[1:38:48] watch
[1:38:49] day. Maybe we shall get
[1:38:53] one. I will use only one hour.
[1:38:58] If I go beyond I if it knocks 1
[1:39:02] hour it's it's now
[1:39:08] 11:40 41 past
[1:39:12] midday
[1:39:15] 01 I have to be
[1:39:18] off of preaching the Bible says numbers
[1:39:23] 35:26 to 28
[1:39:32] But if the slayer shall at any time come
[1:39:36] without the border of the city of his
[1:39:38] refuge, whether he was fled, and the
[1:39:42] revenger of blood find him without the
[1:39:45] borders of the city of his refuge, and
[1:39:49] the revenger of blood killed the slayer,
[1:39:52] he shall not be guilty of
[1:39:54] blood because he should have remained in
[1:39:59] the city of his
[1:40:01] refuge. I want to stop
[1:40:04] there and not continue with that
[1:40:07] verse because that's what I want.
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:48] Amen. Shall we pray? Father, add a
[1:40:52] blessing to your word.
[1:40:54] Open it. Speak it
[1:40:56] out. Reveal it to your
[1:40:59] people. Open their
[1:41:01] hearts. Open their
[1:41:03] minds. Make them
[1:41:05] ready to become better
[1:41:08] Christian. In Jesus Christ name I
[1:41:11] pray. Amen. Please take your
[1:41:15] seats. Amen. Amen. God bless each one of
[1:41:19] you. Our guests, you are most welcome.
[1:41:23] This is days of the voice fellowship.
[1:41:24] Days of the voice fellowship. No law but
[1:41:27] love. No membership
[1:41:30] but no book but the
[1:41:33] Bible and the blood of Jesus
[1:41:39] Christ. Amen. Our pastor is not with us.
[1:41:44] We all know he's in Australia.
[1:41:47] He called me on
[1:41:48] Saturday and he said, "I'm praying for
[1:41:51] you.
[1:41:52] It always encourages
[1:41:54] us. He always calls
[1:41:57] us. He He always calls
[1:42:00] us and says, "I'm praying for you."
[1:42:03] Yes. So is good and I believe you are
[1:42:07] praying for
[1:42:09] him. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:13] Amen. Amen. Amen. You are happy. You are
[1:42:18] ready for the word.
[1:42:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:23] My subject today
[1:42:26] is stay within the
[1:42:30] borders. Stay within the
[1:42:33] borders of the city of
[1:42:37] refuge. Stay within the
[1:42:40] borders of the city of
[1:42:43] refuge. Don't go beyond the
[1:42:46] borders. Stay within
[1:42:48] there. In the Old
[1:42:50] Testament when God called the children
[1:42:52] of
[1:42:54] Israel, he
[1:42:56] said when he said after I've given you
[1:43:00] the
[1:43:02] victory and you have conquered the
[1:43:04] land, taken possession of
[1:43:07] it, you shall appoint six
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:11] cities. And these cities belong to the
[1:43:16] Levites. And these six cities
[1:43:19] were to be
[1:43:21] taken. A
[1:43:23] city, the rest of the
[1:43:25] tribes had to surrender a
[1:43:28] portion of their
[1:43:30] inheritance and to the Levites and to
[1:43:33] the
[1:43:34] Levites no
[1:43:36] inheritance because the Levites had to
[1:43:39] receive an
[1:43:40] inheritance from the
[1:43:42] inheritance of their president.
[1:43:46] Then he
[1:43:48] says then you appoint six
[1:43:51] cities and these six
[1:43:54] cities this is
[1:43:58] Jordan before crossing
[1:44:01] Jordan appointed three
[1:44:03] cities and after
[1:44:06] Jordan appointed three
[1:44:08] cities that had a
[1:44:15] And then he
[1:44:18] said that he that kills a
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:24] man and
[1:44:28] aware by mistake.
[1:44:31] He should
[1:44:33] flee to one of the
[1:44:37] cities
[1:44:39] that he may not be
[1:44:43] slain by the avenger of
[1:44:48] blood. Take
[1:44:50] note the avenger of
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:44:54] blood. If he
[1:44:57] avenged, he was not guilty.
[1:45:01] Amen. Because it was an
[1:45:06] iPhone. So there was an avenge of
[1:45:10] blood. You slay a man, the avenge of
[1:45:14] blood
[1:45:15] comes to you also and he is not guilty.
[1:45:22] Therefore, God says, "There are people
[1:45:25] that do these
[1:45:27] things, kill one another
[1:45:31] unaware. Such a one is
[1:45:35] innocent. He needs to be
[1:45:38] forgiven, but there was no
[1:45:41] forgiveness. Then God said such a one.
[1:45:46] It is a blessing where they can
[1:45:48] flee and the avenge of blood
[1:45:52] I have no permission to go in there and
[1:45:56] kill
[1:45:57] them. Amen.
[1:46:00] Then he
[1:46:01] says only
[1:46:03] those that do it by
[1:46:07] mist they did it but they didn't mean to
[1:46:11] do
[1:46:12] it. They don't want to do it. It's not
[1:46:16] in their hearts to do it. They didn't
[1:46:19] plan to do it.
[1:46:21] They had to do it. It's not a part of
[1:46:24] them. They don't want
[1:46:26] it. But they did
[1:46:29] it. It says for make them a city of
[1:46:34] rest six of
[1:46:38] them.
[1:46:41] But if any
[1:46:43] man
[1:46:47] premeditates, plans
[1:46:54] I hate him. I don't know I can poison
[1:46:57] him. Kill him. And you plan this how I
[1:47:02] will do it. Get him a
[1:47:05] Jewish brother minister take this. Oh
[1:47:11] God bless you. And he takes it and he
[1:47:15] dies and you have committed murder. God
[1:47:19] says, "Such
[1:47:21] one shall not be allowed to go into the
[1:47:25] seat of
[1:47:26] God. He should surely be
[1:47:29] killed by the avenge of
[1:47:34] blood in Numbers 35 and in Joshua 20,
[1:47:39] Joshua did it and he put those
[1:47:45] cities. A man that runs to that
[1:47:49] city was
[1:47:51] supposed to stay within the
[1:47:55] borders that
[1:47:57] city until the high priest of that
[1:48:03] time
[1:48:04] ties then you are
[1:48:07] free can
[1:48:09] go. And also this man had to stand
[1:48:14] before the
[1:48:16] congregation for
[1:48:19] judgment but is
[1:48:22] innocent is is okay in the seat of ref.
[1:48:30] But if this
[1:48:33] man dares to get
[1:48:36] out and goes
[1:48:39] beyond the borders of that
[1:48:42] city and the high
[1:48:44] priest is not yet dead of that
[1:48:49] time, that man and the avenger of blood
[1:48:54] comes and he finds him beyond the
[1:48:58] borders of God.
[1:49:01] He he will surely seal
[1:49:06] him and he is not
[1:49:10] guilty because he went out of the seat
[1:49:13] of
[1:49:18] refuge. But if he goes in the seat of
[1:49:23] refuge to to to
[1:49:26] avenge kill the other
[1:49:28] one, it it's not
[1:49:32] granted. We are
[1:49:34] together stay within the
[1:49:38] borders. There are so many
[1:49:41] things and people
[1:49:44] today count for a place of refuge.
[1:49:50] Some it's their
[1:49:52] money, others it's
[1:49:55] music. To some it's their
[1:49:58] phones. As long as I have a
[1:50:01] smartphone and it has
[1:50:04] data. Well, I feel
[1:50:06] safe. I feel
[1:50:08] good to others. It's
[1:50:11] their as long as I'm a Catholic. As long
[1:50:15] as I'm a
[1:50:16] Muslim, as long as I'm a Jehovah
[1:50:19] witness, as long as I'm I go to a
[1:50:21] message
[1:50:23] church, as long as I'm this or that, I
[1:50:26] know I am
[1:50:27] safe. You are not
[1:50:30] safe, to some it's their fellow church
[1:50:34] members, to some it's the
[1:50:37] pastor, but they count him for a
[1:50:40] refuge. To some it's
[1:50:43] television. They feel safe with it. They
[1:50:46] just can't do without
[1:50:48] it. And programs they feel comforted.
[1:50:53] Tik Tok. They feel
[1:50:55] comforted. When they laugh, they feel
[1:50:58] they're happy. But it is just a
[1:51:02] noise. It's just a
[1:51:04] noise. Not happiness to others. It's
[1:51:08] social media. Social media. They feel
[1:51:10] they can run into it on their
[1:51:14] status and express their
[1:51:16] feelings. Social media cannot be touched
[1:51:20] the feeling
[1:51:22] of there was a sister in courtship with
[1:51:26] the
[1:51:26] brother when the brother
[1:51:29] cheated. She she said he
[1:51:33] cheated. His strength went away and he
[1:51:36] posted it on her
[1:51:38] status crying. The sister went
[1:51:42] strong. He
[1:51:44] cheated. Then all of us who
[1:51:47] commented, "Sorry, sorry. God bless you.
[1:51:50] God will comfort
[1:51:52] you." She
[1:51:55] posted to feel
[1:51:59] comforted. But that can't comfort.
[1:52:03] That can't be a
[1:52:04] refuge. No brother. It cannot be that
[1:52:09] the people count certain things for a
[1:52:13] place of
[1:52:15] refuge which don't
[1:52:17] work. They run church to church place to
[1:52:22] place seeking
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:25] rest
[1:52:26] about running different
[1:52:29] cities.
[1:52:31] If I run to
[1:52:33] campa pressure
[1:52:35] rises, pressure
[1:52:38] increases. They run
[1:52:41] from go
[1:52:43] to
[1:52:45] pressure. They run from go back to the
[1:52:48] village. Pressurize. There is no refuge
[1:52:53] on to others. It's their
[1:52:57] position. Possession.
[1:53:00] Like the rich man that had a lot, he had
[1:53:04] plenty of
[1:53:06] harvest and he said, "Rest my
[1:53:10] soul. You have
[1:53:12] bread. Rest my soul. You have bread."
[1:53:16] But when God come down, he said, "Thou
[1:53:21] poor." And when the pharaoh
[1:53:24] died, he didn't get rest.
[1:53:27] He
[1:53:29] perished in hell. He
[1:53:31] wept. The possession couldn't give him
[1:53:36] refuge. Brother, sister, others, they
[1:53:41] count their
[1:53:42] husbands or their wives for a blessed
[1:53:47] breakfast. One will say, I will just run
[1:53:51] over to my husband and all all will be
[1:53:55] well. I will just run over to my wife.
[1:54:00] I'll just feel safe as safe can
[1:54:04] be. And another said the children, they
[1:54:09] will say, "My mommy, my daddy. I can
[1:54:13] just run to them any time. I'm just
[1:54:18] safe."
[1:54:20] But we find out in the old
[1:54:24] testament in the days of
[1:54:27] Moses when they were in
[1:54:29] Egypt and the death angel was passing in
[1:54:33] the land of
[1:54:34] Egypt to sele at the
[1:54:37] festival. Maybe these children would
[1:54:39] say, "Oh, mama, look. There is Oh, papa.
[1:54:45] There is there is a darkness. There it
[1:54:48] is." And mama,
[1:54:52] papa, I'm not seeing it, sir. I'm not
[1:54:55] seeing it, sir. There it is. There it
[1:55:01] is.
[1:55:03] Amen. Hallelujah. They couldn't
[1:55:08] help it was the same days of
[1:55:12] L in the days of Lord. The people
[1:55:16] cried ran to different places. Maybe
[1:55:19] they climbed trees. Maybe they had built
[1:55:23] caves. Maybe they had got
[1:55:26] mushrooms. Maybe they had got a lot of
[1:55:28] things. But when the flood came the
[1:55:32] place of refuge was
[1:55:35] the knew what
[1:55:37] met
[1:55:39] always one place of
[1:55:47] refuge but maybe they
[1:55:50] try maybe they had a
[1:55:53] titanic of their day but it couldn't
[1:55:57] work because
[1:56:00] A refuge must be ordained of
[1:56:05] God. Hallelujah. You cannot ordain a
[1:56:08] refuge as a man. This is where I run to
[1:56:13] when the trouble
[1:56:14] comes. This is where I will run
[1:56:18] to. It will pick you
[1:56:21] up. It will go
[1:56:24] there. Trouble will go
[1:56:26] there. It will pick you out.
[1:56:30] and destroy you.
[1:56:32] Brother, in the days of Lot, some had
[1:56:36] strong
[1:56:38] houses. The kings in their
[1:56:40] palaces, but the fire that
[1:56:43] came could not see the strength of those
[1:56:47] marches. Oh brother, the roof which
[1:56:52] was run, flee to the mountain.
[1:56:59] It was an
[1:57:01] emergency and in the times of
[1:57:04] emergency, God provides
[1:57:07] a
[1:57:09] those to
[1:57:13] those that are
[1:57:16] innocent. Hallelujah. Man has always run
[1:57:22] somewhere, somewhere where they can find
[1:57:24] refuge.
[1:57:29] These cities of
[1:57:32] refugee, they were for
[1:57:34] all the strangers,
[1:57:37] the
[1:57:38] sjaners, children of
[1:57:40] Israel, all of these
[1:57:42] ones, six of them, three
[1:57:46] decided
[1:57:49] typing, you know, across
[1:57:51] Jordan is the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:55] Before Jordan,
[1:57:56] You are still you are still there in
[1:57:59] sanctification
[1:58:01] church. But even
[1:58:04] there God
[1:58:05] says these people that have not yet
[1:58:09] received the Holy
[1:58:11] Spirit and they have accepted the Lord.
[1:58:14] If they do anything
[1:58:16] wrong, they can
[1:58:18] come to the city of refuge. Even these
[1:58:22] ones that have the Holy Ghost shall do
[1:58:27] mistakes. But they can
[1:58:30] have
[1:58:32] refuge. Never ever
[1:58:35] think because the brother, a sister's
[1:58:38] done a
[1:58:40] mission, does not have the Holy
[1:58:44] Ghost. That's
[1:58:48] wrong. That's not right.
[1:58:52] That was the
[1:58:53] type. And you notice that when God
[1:58:58] always provides and makes a way of
[1:59:02] escape for all men, but
[1:59:06] men reject it. They refuse to enter in.
[1:59:12] Some stop at the
[1:59:13] door. Some just talk about
[1:59:17] it. Can you imagine? Some look at
[1:59:21] it. And say, "Well, it's pretty
[1:59:26] good. It's a fine good
[1:59:29] sermon." They won't get
[1:59:32] in. Some say it's the devil and they
[1:59:37] burst him and
[1:59:39] perish. Some point others to
[1:59:43] it and themselves never go in.
[1:59:47] Some stop others from getting
[1:59:51] it. Like the
[1:59:55] Pharisees in those
[1:59:57] days, the innocent one, someone that has
[2:00:01] done
[2:00:02] harm, but they didn't mean to do
[2:00:05] harm. They had to
[2:00:08] flee to the place of refuge.
[2:00:11] I want you to
[2:00:14] notice a man had to
[2:00:18] flee, not to
[2:00:20] walk, push themselves
[2:00:25] [Applause]
[2:00:27] around, should I
[2:00:32] go? And then they go, should I
[2:00:35] return? He had to flee.
[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:40] Hallelujah. Not to be as if going as if
[2:00:44] not but disappear
[2:00:47] quickly in
[2:00:48] haste. You flee for your
[2:00:52] life because the
[2:00:56] avenger. If he finds you, he will slay
[2:01:01] you. Flee. You run as fast
[2:01:06] as you don't look back. You just run
[2:01:13] for Hallelujah.
[2:01:15] Or
[2:01:16] else you are
[2:01:19] guilty. You the avenger will slay
[2:01:24] you. There was a man sent from God.
[2:01:28] He was Reverend William Maron. Reverend
[2:01:30] William. He was a prophet of the
[2:01:34] entire end time age, the last church
[2:01:38] age. He preached a
[2:01:41] message letting off the
[2:01:43] pressure in
[2:01:45] 1962. And he said, "Now in the Old
[2:01:50] Testament, God is saying in some of this
[2:01:56] trouble was accidentally
[2:02:01] done." So if you are
[2:02:04] innocent and not
[2:02:07] guilty, God makes a way for you.
[2:02:12] Now if a man killed a
[2:02:15] man just
[2:02:18] deliberately
[2:02:20] premeditated, he was
[2:02:23] lost. He could not
[2:02:26] come to this
[2:02:28] place. But if he
[2:02:32] did, he didn't mean to do
[2:02:35] it. Then there was a
[2:02:39] city. Amen.
[2:02:41] He says now the people could come to
[2:02:45] this
[2:02:47] city if
[2:02:49] accidentally he done something
[2:02:53] wrong. He didn't mean
[2:02:56] to he would come to the
[2:02:59] situation and go to the
[2:03:02] gate. The
[2:03:05] gatekeeper would ask him why he was
[2:03:09] coming.
[2:03:19] The
[2:03:21] gatekeeper would ask him, "Why have you
[2:03:27] come?" What was his idea of coming?
[2:03:36] Then his case was
[2:03:39] pleaded. And when his case was pleaded
[2:03:42] at the
[2:03:44] gate and the man be formed found
[2:03:50] innocent, he did it not
[2:03:53] willfully. Then the
[2:03:55] man was taken into the
[2:03:58] city as a place of refuge.
[2:04:03] Then the enemy could not get
[2:04:08] him. And if he
[2:04:11] lied and done
[2:04:14] wrong and he come into the city
[2:04:18] of though he was holding on the horns of
[2:04:21] the
[2:04:23] altar, his enemy had the privilege and
[2:04:28] the right to drag him on that altar.
[2:04:33] kill him.
[2:04:36] That's what happens in the
[2:04:40] church. Come to God
[2:04:44] sincerely. Yes, sir. Because he was
[2:04:49] guilty,
[2:04:51] premeditated and he had to be punished.
[2:04:59] You see the
[2:05:02] avenger is a
[2:05:05] punisher. He puts the
[2:05:07] pain upon the
[2:05:14] wrongdoer. There was something went with
[2:05:19] dad because that man would be
[2:05:25] nervous. He would be nervous. My he says
[2:05:30] maybe a dozen of men behind
[2:05:34] it somewhere every
[2:05:36] rock every hill every
[2:05:40] bush the
[2:05:42] enemy was there the avenger was
[2:05:46] there because straight is the
[2:05:49] gate and narrow is the
[2:05:52] way somebody was standing
[2:05:55] ready for
[2:05:57] him. He was
[2:06:00] nervous. And then when he once got into
[2:06:03] the
[2:06:04] city, he would let off the
[2:06:08] pressure. He was
[2:06:11] safe. He was all
[2:06:13] right because there was a provided
[2:06:17] place made for
[2:06:20] him. Oh brother, sister, maybe you look
[2:06:24] on the side. Land road is
[2:06:27] knocking and you turn this
[2:06:31] side the electricity is over. When you
[2:06:34] look this
[2:06:37] side when you look the other
[2:06:39] side the wife is sick. As you're there,
[2:06:44] the Lord's office, as you're there, the
[2:06:47] children are hungry. Rest rises up.
[2:06:53] You can run
[2:06:54] somewhere. You can run
[2:06:57] somewhere. Don't let the pressure
[2:07:00] rise. Run into the
[2:07:03] borders. He says, "There was a provided
[2:07:09] place for him. God has provided
[2:07:13] way that innocent
[2:07:16] man not to be
[2:07:19] slain. Amen.
[2:07:22] But he could be exempted from
[2:07:28] slaying because he did it
[2:07:32] accidentally if he didn't mean to do
[2:07:35] it. But if he meant to do
[2:07:38] it, he had to stand the circumstance.
[2:07:43] Brother,
[2:07:45] sister,
[2:07:48] sin, believer or not
[2:07:51] believer will never go
[2:08:00] unpunished. That's hard to
[2:08:03] swallow, but you have to swallow it.
[2:08:07] Believe or not,
[2:08:08] believe sin has to be punished,
[2:08:18] there is no chance for
[2:08:20] him if he did it willfully.
[2:08:29] Brother,
[2:08:32] sister, in those
[2:08:34] days, God gave them six
[2:08:38] cities. But when you see there are
[2:08:43] 60 there's one
[2:08:45] missing to complete the
[2:08:48] number. They have got to be
[2:08:52] seven. They have to be seven cities.
[2:08:56] But the seventh is always a mystery.
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:02] The seventh is a
[2:09:05] man. Hallelujah.
[2:09:07] I'm saying the
[2:09:09] servant is a man.
[2:09:12] God the
[2:09:14] servant. The Bible says Psalms
[2:09:19] 9:9-10, the Lord
[2:09:22] also will be a
[2:09:25] refuge for the
[2:09:27] oppressed, a refuge in times of
[2:09:31] trouble. The 70 city of
[2:09:34] refuge is the Lord
[2:09:36] himself where people can
[2:09:39] flee where people can run
[2:09:42] too and find rest.
[2:09:48] You are getting it here.
[2:09:51] It
[2:09:52] says, "Whosoever
[2:09:55] will he that is heavy
[2:09:59] laddened and weak, come and have
[2:10:04] rest." If you are tired of
[2:10:07] sin, you have walked in
[2:10:09] impunity. You have you are worn
[2:10:12] out. You are tired of
[2:10:15] sickness. You are tired of
[2:10:17] jealous. You are tired of anger.
[2:10:20] You are tired of lust. You are tired of
[2:10:24] bitterness. You are tired of rumors and
[2:10:27] it is eating you
[2:10:29] up and it eats like a
[2:10:32] c. But if you don't want
[2:10:35] it, there is a
[2:10:37] refuge where you can be set
[2:10:40] free if you want
[2:10:43] it. If you want it, that is sin that
[2:10:48] grips your
[2:10:49] soul and it doesn't grieve
[2:10:52] you, you will perish with it.
[2:10:57] But if
[2:10:58] you don't want it out, I don't want this
[2:11:03] weakness. It has beaten me down. You
[2:11:06] know, I don't want it. Come for
[2:11:10] rest.
[2:11:13] Christianity, he
[2:11:14] says, I will give you
[2:11:18] rest because my
[2:11:21] yoke is light.
[2:11:26] My burden is
[2:11:28] light. Learn of
[2:11:31] me. I am meek and lowly in
[2:11:35] [Music]
[2:11:37] me. Seline and
[2:11:40] holy, obedient to
[2:11:43] lord. I long to be like him.
[2:11:48] It
[2:11:49] says you shall find
[2:11:52] rest unto your
[2:11:55] soul.
[2:11:57] Christianity is about
[2:12:00] rest.
[2:12:06] Hallelujah.
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:11] Rest. If you are in
[2:12:14] Christ, it's about rest.
[2:12:18] Let off the
[2:12:19] pressure. Stay within the
[2:12:22] borders. All is well. All is well. All
[2:12:26] is well. All is well. Stay within the
[2:12:31] borders. She said, "It is well. It is
[2:12:36] well. It is well. It is well. It is
[2:12:40] well. It is
[2:12:42] [Music]
[2:12:44] well." Some say
[2:12:47] What if someone would
[2:12:49] say in those
[2:12:51] days, well, the city is too
[2:12:54] far, I will just run over here to my
[2:13:00] neighbor that can hide it
[2:13:02] there. I will run over here to my
[2:13:05] friends and hide it there. It's so hard
[2:13:08] to get the Holy Ghost.
[2:13:11] It's not
[2:13:12] hard. Is it receive the Holy Ghost? They
[2:13:17] that hunger and
[2:13:19] thirsty after
[2:13:21] righteousness, they shall be
[2:13:23] filled. Oh
[2:13:25] God, how can I
[2:13:27] overcome? Faith is the
[2:13:30] victory and overcomes the
[2:13:33] world. Oh
[2:13:35] Lord, how can I defeat
[2:13:38] this? I'm so heavily
[2:13:41] burdened with the Lord
[2:13:44] of so
[2:13:46] defeated. I need a breakthrough.
[2:13:51] Lord, it is
[2:13:53] easy. Stay within the
[2:13:57] border. Hallelujah. I am weak. Perhaps
[2:14:02] they would say I will run over to my
[2:14:05] friend and hide there because I am weak
[2:14:09] because I'm tired. I can't pray. I can
[2:14:13] do this. I can do that. You will
[2:14:20] perish. This pharaoh had no
[2:14:25] choice. The man has no
[2:14:28] choice. Sin has no choice.
[2:14:31] You have no choice. You have no choice
[2:14:34] but to run.
[2:14:38] What can I do? Lord, you have no choice
[2:14:42] to run.
[2:14:45] I am tired. I just can't go through all
[2:14:50] that running
[2:14:51] in Christianity.
[2:14:54] Full of desperation.
[2:14:57] It's full of it's hard. Yeah, it's hard.
[2:15:04] But you are not alone.
[2:15:06] God bless you, brother
[2:15:08] Martin. You are not alone. He helps you
[2:15:11] to
[2:15:13] run in the
[2:15:15] race. I just can't make it. Let me go
[2:15:19] over here. To my
[2:15:21] in-laws, to my
[2:15:23] relative, let me do this or that.
[2:15:26] When the avenger
[2:15:29] comes, we shall talk it
[2:15:31] over. I've heard he can be
[2:15:35] merciful. He will
[2:15:38] understand. He will not
[2:15:43] understand. Poor little
[2:15:45] soul, brother,
[2:15:47] sister. He will not understand.
[2:15:52] The Lord understands.
[2:15:56] He understands
[2:16:00] now
[2:16:02] later. He won't
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:11] understand. He won't understand your
[2:16:15] cry. Seek the Lord. But he can still
[2:16:18] be run. When there is still time to
[2:16:23] repent, when there is still mercy, when
[2:16:26] the rapture is gone, there's no baptism
[2:16:29] of the Holy
[2:16:33] Ghost. The
[2:16:35] rapture goes with the Holy
[2:16:39] Ghost. The
[2:16:41] rapture goes with the
[2:16:45] blood. Stay within the border.
[2:16:49] run to the
[2:16:52] borders. Look
[2:16:54] brother, this
[2:16:56] fellow he had no say
[2:17:00] whatsoever. He is a
[2:17:03] subject after he has entered this
[2:17:06] city. He has no
[2:17:09] say. He is a
[2:17:12] subject under the
[2:17:14] government of that city, under the laws
[2:17:19] of that
[2:17:20] city, he is under the
[2:17:24] control of that city.
[2:17:28] Whatever the city
[2:17:31] offers, he must be
[2:17:39] satisful because he has only fled for
[2:17:47] refuge. You can't
[2:17:50] flee to my home or
[2:17:54] refuge and you start giving
[2:17:58] order remove that chair. Put it
[2:18:02] there. I will take it
[2:18:07] there turn it like this. I'll turn it
[2:18:10] and it will look that
[2:18:13] side when you come back.
[2:18:18] I'm not happy with this.
[2:18:20] If you don't hear
[2:18:22] me say pastor, this brother has a
[2:18:25] problem.
[2:18:27] What am I saying? You don't flee for
[2:18:32] refuge to put orders.
[2:18:36] You must abide by the
[2:18:39] Lord. Amen.
[2:18:42] Now,
[2:18:44] now someone will
[2:18:48] say, "When you get married,
[2:18:54] won't you stay in pastor's office all
[2:18:56] the time?"
[2:18:59] Because if you tell the wife like that,
[2:19:02] you're saying, "Brother Julius, if you
[2:19:04] get a wife and you treat her like that,
[2:19:06] won't you always be in pastor's
[2:19:07] office? If she says turn the bed like
[2:19:10] this and you turn it there and then you
[2:19:13] say what is wrong with you? Not the
[2:19:15] wife. Not the wife.
[2:19:18] I'm saying a stranger that has spread
[2:19:22] to the world is under a
[2:19:27] curse. So you have to stay within the
[2:19:31] borders of the
[2:19:33] message because the
[2:19:36] message is the
[2:19:39] cast.
[2:19:40] Hallelujah. Stay within the
[2:19:43] borders the world has been
[2:19:47] cast and in the
[2:19:50] message the message stays
[2:19:54] the stay within the borders of the word.
[2:19:58] Stay within the borders of the
[2:20:01] cross
[2:20:03] and it shall be
[2:20:07] well. Just stay within the
[2:20:13] border.
[2:20:15] Amen. Just within there.
[2:20:19] It is
[2:20:22] well.
[2:20:24] Imagine this fellow could
[2:20:32] run. But then he looks
[2:20:38] back. He had no
[2:20:40] rest until he said.
[2:20:44] Hallelujah.
[2:20:49] There is two classes of people today.
[2:20:54] May I say this? There's men and
[2:20:57] women in the world
[2:21:00] today. Then he says that really don't
[2:21:04] want to do these things they are
[2:21:08] doing in the church here.
[2:21:11] They don't want to do the things they
[2:21:15] want. There is men and
[2:21:18] women in the world
[2:21:20] today that don't want to
[2:21:26] sin. I feel sorry for them.
[2:21:33] They don't want to do anything
[2:21:38] wrong,
[2:21:39] but they do
[2:21:41] [Music]
[2:21:45] it. They are drove to
[2:21:53] it. Something drives
[2:21:58] them. After doing it, they cried.
[2:22:04] I
[2:22:05] remember when I was a
[2:22:08] Pentecost, I tried to
[2:22:11] overcome the
[2:22:14] world, I tried and I
[2:22:16] tried, I fasted and I
[2:22:19] prayed, but the next
[2:22:22] day I go back into the same thing. I
[2:22:25] wake up at night. I cried. Lord forgive
[2:22:29] me. Lord help me. What can I
[2:22:33] do? I
[2:22:35] failed. But when I came to the
[2:22:39] message just to come to the
[2:22:41] message rather I don't know I
[2:22:45] overcame and I
[2:22:47] overcame.
[2:22:49] Hallelujah. Yes sir. There is the power
[2:22:53] in the message.
[2:22:56] He
[2:22:57] says there is a place for that
[2:23:01] person that wants to do
[2:23:04] right. There is a
[2:23:07] place let off that
[2:23:10] person. It's
[2:23:12] true. But there is
[2:23:14] some that don't
[2:23:18] care. They come to the
[2:23:21] church. Listen. Every time you come to
[2:23:25] church, you either go back
[2:23:27] better or
[2:23:29] worse whether I like it or
[2:23:32] not.
[2:23:34] Big-headed,
[2:23:39] highminded,
[2:23:41] stubborn. I don't
[2:23:44] care. Brother, this is not a home where
[2:23:49] we have to say
[2:23:54] Jesus is not for stubborn
[2:23:57] people. The gospel is not your mother's
[2:24:00] teaching.
[2:24:03] It's not your mother's stick. Like what?
[2:24:07] What? The gospel ought to change
[2:24:11] you. Hallelujah.
[2:24:14] What is something
[2:24:16] said and do
[2:24:17] [Music]
[2:24:22] right
[2:24:26] nature
[2:24:29] nature pull
[2:24:32] them pull them pull them that
[2:24:37] stubbornness cannot take you
[2:24:39] anywhere brother sister you ought to
[2:24:43] come to
[2:24:45] without no one pushing
[2:24:47] you. Do what is
[2:24:50] right. Think
[2:24:52] right. Be
[2:24:54] right. Do right. Become
[2:24:58] right. Respect
[2:25:02] God. God is not respect
[2:25:05] person. How will God be
[2:25:09] respected? God is not respect person.
[2:25:13] Ah, God has tough
[2:25:16] today. I I'm I'm trying to cast that
[2:25:20] demon
[2:25:23] out. He will never bow to any
[2:25:27] man. He cannot put
[2:25:33] difference. You just they just don't
[2:25:36] care.
[2:25:39] He says, "You
[2:25:41] see, some people don't
[2:25:44] care. They don't want at
[2:25:48] all. It does nothing to
[2:25:53] them. You preach it does nothing to
[2:25:57] them. Pastor talks to them, it does
[2:26:01] [Music]
[2:26:02] nothing. He talks this and it does that.
[2:26:08] tap on
[2:26:09] anyhow just carry
[2:26:12] on brother
[2:26:14] sister they just love to walk in
[2:26:19] sing just like a
[2:26:21] pig loves to play in the
[2:26:26] m eating
[2:26:28] vomit such a
[2:26:31] fellow has no
[2:26:33] blessing has no part
[2:26:37] Christ says the
[2:26:40] prophet. Hallelujah. Beat
[2:26:43] preacher, beat song leader, beat
[2:26:47] musician, beat teacher, beat prophet,
[2:26:51] pastor,
[2:26:52] evangelist with that
[2:26:55] kind, husband or wife, you have no part
[2:26:59] in Christ.
[2:27:05] He come for the
[2:27:08] weary. Those that are tired to walk
[2:27:11] [Music]
[2:27:13] in. If you love
[2:27:16] it,
[2:27:17] listen, just carry
[2:27:21] on. But the end there is
[2:27:26] dead. If you want to do
[2:27:28] right, I'm so glad tonight to tell you
[2:27:32] that there is a city
[2:27:37] A city of
[2:27:38] love, a city of
[2:27:40] mercy that is Jesus
[2:27:43] Christ. If you don't want to do
[2:27:47] wrong and the enemy is after
[2:27:50] you say, "Brother Julius, understand
[2:27:55] me, I don't want
[2:27:57] it. It is you that I want. There is a
[2:28:00] way of escape.
[2:28:03] That escape is
[2:28:05] Jesus. There is a
[2:28:07] place where you can
[2:28:09] come and let off the
[2:28:16] steam. Hallelujah. But if you love to
[2:28:20] sin and you don't want
[2:28:24] God, then the
[2:28:26] enemy is going to overtake you
[2:28:29] somewhere.
[2:28:33] Listen, you can't come to
[2:28:37] Christ. You can't come to
[2:28:40] Christ because you don't want
[2:28:43] [Music]
[2:28:47] to
[2:28:50] see. You love
[2:28:53] sin, so you can't come to Christ.
[2:28:57] For it is written, John
[2:29:01] 3:19, this is the
[2:29:03] condemnation that light is coming to the
[2:29:06] world. And men loved
[2:29:09] darkness rather than light because their
[2:29:13] deeds were
[2:29:16] evil. For
[2:29:18] everyone that does
[2:29:20] evil hates the
[2:29:22] light, neither comes to the
[2:29:25] light. Lest is it did should be
[2:29:30] reproved. Reprove
[2:29:33] them. Reprove
[2:29:37] them. Try to reprove them. See how they
[2:29:42] respond. You will
[2:29:45] know. But he that does
[2:29:49] truth comes to the
[2:29:51] light that his
[2:29:53] deeds may be manifest. that they are
[2:29:56] wrought in
[2:29:59] God. Amen.
[2:30:03] When this man comes to Christ,
[2:30:09] a place of
[2:30:11] refuge, when a a man come
[2:30:15] in the Old
[2:30:18] Testament, the first
[2:30:20] thing he
[2:30:23] had he had to come upon his own free
[2:30:28] will.
[2:30:35] And that's the
[2:30:37] way you have to come to Christ.
[2:30:46] Now you say, "Brother
[2:30:48] Julius, I came many years ago."
[2:30:51] [Music]
[2:30:52] All
[2:30:53] right. Another
[2:30:56] thing you must be satisfied.
[2:31:01] while you are there.
[2:31:06] You can't hang
[2:31:09] around every day
[2:31:11] crying. I would like to get out of
[2:31:14] here. I like to get out of here. They
[2:31:18] would put you
[2:31:20] out. You must
[2:31:22] willfully want to stay.
[2:31:32] comes don't
[2:31:35] go please
[2:31:38] wait may not do
[2:31:42] that not all of us have patience
[2:31:49] like I may tell one time or two
[2:31:52] time
[2:31:55] says if you try to reprove somebody
[2:31:58] twice
[2:32:00] and they refuse. That one is an
[2:32:07] heretic. Leave them
[2:32:09] alone and I'm not
[2:32:22] guilty. Come to church. Where are you
[2:32:25] today?
[2:32:27] Leave that
[2:32:28] [Music]
[2:32:32] girl. Don't get married. I'm
[2:32:36] begging. Why making the pastor kneel?
[2:32:42] Brother, you must want to stay.
[2:32:49] It must be
[2:32:52] that you must want to stay in that city.
[2:33:01] Show
[2:33:02] love so that you love
[2:33:05] Christ that you don't want to leave
[2:33:09] him. Show that where you enter the
[2:33:15] best. Show that what you
[2:33:18] have. It is a power of great price.
[2:33:30] Show love. Express your
[2:33:34] love to the city you entered
[2:33:42] in. Brother, sometimes I'm beaten here
[2:33:45] and
[2:33:46] there. Yeah, I am talking about you. You
[2:33:50] are the one I'm talking about.
[2:33:53] I love these
[2:33:55] things. I love these things.
[2:33:58] But now when you leave here today, we
[2:34:02] have completed
[2:34:03] you. We have finished it. Don't start
[2:34:07] telling
[2:34:10] us. We have given you the
[2:34:14] t. Don't take it. It is up to
[2:34:19] you. And this preacher is not caring.
[2:34:23] The preacher is caring. That is why he
[2:34:25] has brought the message.
[2:34:28] God cares.
[2:34:30] The message is a refuge.
[2:34:33] When you come to Christ,
[2:34:35] you can't look back to the world. The
[2:34:39] Bible says, "He that puts a hand to the
[2:34:45] plow and turns to look
[2:34:48] back is not worthy of the plowing.
[2:34:55] Luke 962 there is where so many soal
[2:34:59] Christians make their
[2:35:04] mistake. They act like they are going to
[2:35:08] blow but the first little thing comes
[2:35:13] along they blow
[2:35:15] [Music]
[2:35:16] up about it.
[2:35:22] Walk unconscious of
[2:35:25] fear. Walk unconscious of
[2:35:29] criticism. Just walk with
[2:35:32] God. He
[2:35:35] says you must count the cost
[2:35:45] first. You have start the race.
[2:35:51] Are you ready to start on until when you
[2:35:54] enter the city of
[2:35:57] refuge? And are you ready if you reach
[2:36:00] the city to stay there? Cuz if you enter
[2:36:02] this
[2:36:05] city, you must know that you are
[2:36:08] covered. You are protected. You have
[2:36:10] boundaries.
[2:36:11] You shouldn't go beyond
[2:36:19] now. Don't tell us. You
[2:36:22] know me. I'm waiting.
[2:36:25] The brothers in the church are not doing
[2:36:28] anything. I'm
[2:36:30] old. We shall not listen to that.
[2:36:35] You are not old. You are still a younger
[2:36:38] girl. And you look
[2:36:41] beautiful now. Don't be on
[2:36:45] pressure. Rest
[2:36:51] now. That is why I met
[2:36:53] Tony. You know this Tony will
[2:36:59] change. Why Tony won't
[2:37:02] change? Tony wants
[2:37:05] you after getting you. He will regret.
[2:37:13] Amen.
[2:37:16] Brother say youth like me I don't
[2:37:19] refuse. I am not refusing.
[2:37:22] But it is not
[2:37:24] [Music]
[2:37:27] right. I'm only
[2:37:29] human. I'm just a
[2:37:32] man. I also believe it.
[2:37:36] But what you want to
[2:37:37] do, you're going to go beyond the
[2:37:42] boundary.
[2:37:44] This avenger will attract you. The
[2:37:47] avenger of blood will destroy you.
[2:37:55] That's why I've brought
[2:37:58] a and says if you cross here
[2:38:02] and you leave
[2:38:03] Christ and you go in the
[2:38:06] world you want to
[2:38:08] test you may not return
[2:38:17] it is not the world alone don't
[2:38:19] yield to a wrong spirit
[2:38:25] You must count the cost
[2:38:29] first. You act like as if you are going
[2:38:32] to
[2:38:34] testify, as if you are going to
[2:38:36] give, as if you're going to help, as if
[2:38:40] you're going to pray, as if you're going
[2:38:42] to
[2:38:43] fast. You act like as if something you
[2:38:46] are going to do
[2:38:47] something. Then you start something
[2:38:51] comes up and you blow
[2:38:55] up and you
[2:38:57] begin like a
[2:39:00] chicken. You shout, "You must count the
[2:39:04] cost
[2:39:07] first. I'm just getting done
[2:39:09] here just in my time there." He says,
[2:39:14] "The man must want to stay.
[2:39:19] in the
[2:39:21] refuge. Now listen, he can't go in
[2:39:27] there
[2:39:33] complaining. These things of the
[2:39:35] messaging they are
[2:39:37] no things. We are not free. You are the
[2:39:42] one who is not. You are the one who is
[2:39:44] not free. Hallelujah. be free for us. We
[2:39:47] are free and free indeed.
[2:39:50] Hallelujah.
[2:39:53] Brother, brother, how do you do it? It's
[2:39:57] the grace of God.
[2:40:01] But you have failed to love it.
[2:40:04] He says, he says just fall in love with
[2:40:11] God. He must want to stay.
[2:40:16] He says no complainings about
[2:40:23] it even outside he
[2:40:28] dies inside he is
[2:40:31] safe and that is it
[2:40:34] today. If your aim is to complain about
[2:40:39] the word of
[2:40:42] God, complain about the
[2:40:44] Bible, complain about the message,
[2:40:47] complain about
[2:40:49] this. I am
[2:40:51] afraid, you may blow
[2:40:53] [Music]
[2:40:58] up. The pressure will pump up and then
[2:41:02] you will blow up.
[2:41:07] and begin going astray, going
[2:41:10] mad. Hey,
[2:41:15] you get the hand and you throw it up in
[2:41:18] the air in the
[2:41:21] sky. Probably you in the release it
[2:41:26] and release it in the space. It has
[2:41:29] wings. It has
[2:41:31] feathers. It can even fly.
[2:41:34] where you have thrown it up,
[2:41:37] it will complain
[2:41:39] and then it will blow up because it
[2:41:43] is not an
[2:41:45] eagle and the
[2:41:47] territory where you have put
[2:41:50] it. It is a territory for
[2:41:54] eagles.
[2:41:55] Therefore the hand will
[2:42:04] complain. Take me
[2:42:08] back. You cannot manage evil
[2:42:12] things. If somebody will
[2:42:15] perish, even if you drag them to
[2:42:21] church and employ them to lure
[2:42:26] them and you visit them and give them
[2:42:30] gifts, if they will never get
[2:42:33] saved, you will bring them to church and
[2:42:36] they will
[2:42:37] complain
[2:42:39] because he is not that.
[2:42:43] You are the one tying yourself to
[2:42:46] them. Many people they in the message
[2:42:50] they in the church but we are just tying
[2:42:53] them in brother.
[2:43:07] Forgive me for saying
[2:43:09] that. But the truth
[2:43:11] is you
[2:43:16] will forgive me for saying this because
[2:43:19] after all you will go
[2:43:21] back if this person is
[2:43:24] guilty and you bring them in the state
[2:43:26] of
[2:43:27] refuge because he's
[2:43:30] guilty at the end of it all will cross
[2:43:32] the boundary
[2:43:35] and look for girls and take them to
[2:43:38] their home.
[2:43:40] But he's
[2:43:42] there. He's a preacher. He's
[2:43:47] preter a
[2:43:49] musician. And then after this
[2:43:55] another
[2:43:56] person, he was just dragged.
[2:44:03] It is like forcing somebody into
[2:44:05] marriage, even though they are a
[2:44:07] Christian, even if it is
[2:44:10] me, we may not
[2:44:13] separate, but I may I may leave you
[2:44:17] alone. I said, "Let me
[2:44:21] go. Let me go and look for another
[2:44:24] place, but I will never marry again.
[2:44:28] I would rather go and be somewhere alone
[2:44:31] than staying with this
[2:44:32] woman because you don't love them. They
[2:44:36] just dragged you into
[2:44:42] her. I want to say
[2:44:45] something the people here if you are not
[2:44:49] a
[2:44:50] Christian I came to this city of
[2:44:54] Russia. He says about 30
[2:44:57] years
[2:45:00] ago. I've never wanted to go out.
[2:45:05] I came into
[2:45:07] Christ. Everything that I longed
[2:45:09] for was in
[2:45:13] here. Hallelujah. I don't want to go
[2:45:16] [Music]
[2:45:18] out. I pray
[2:45:20] daily. Oh God, I'm so happy here.
[2:45:25] Just let me
[2:45:29] stay. I never want to leave.
[2:45:33] And I know he will never leave
[2:45:36] me. I know he will never leave you. He
[2:45:40] will never leave you. And the pressure
[2:45:43] gets
[2:45:45] great. If it
[2:45:47] does, then he is our outlet.
[2:45:54] So we don't have to worry about
[2:45:58] it. Hallelujah. If you are all pressured
[2:46:02] up and you don't know where you are
[2:46:06] going, you don't know what's going to
[2:46:08] happen to you after
[2:46:10] death and you know you are going to
[2:46:13] die. You have got to do too. You have
[2:46:16] got to die.
[2:46:18] And the thing to
[2:46:21] come is come to
[2:46:24] Christ the
[2:46:26] refuge and let off the
[2:46:29] [Music]
[2:46:32] pressure.
[2:46:40] Brother and brother
[2:46:44] I need
[2:46:45] something. It
[2:46:47] says we can let off the
[2:46:51] pressure, settle it once for
[2:46:55] all. No matter what takes
[2:46:57] place, listen. No matter what takes
[2:47:02] place, Christ is our
[2:47:05] refuge. Amen. And when we come to
[2:47:09] him, we can let off the pressure.
[2:47:14] You can quit worrying about it.
[2:47:17] [Music]
[2:47:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:47:23] Yes, sir.
[2:47:26] He says, "Well, if I
[2:47:29] die, you say, well, if I die, what's
[2:47:33] going to happen to me? What's going to
[2:47:35] happen to my wife? What's going to
[2:47:37] happen to the
[2:47:39] husband? What's going to happen to the
[2:47:40] children?"
[2:47:42] Just come to Christ
[2:47:45] and let off the
[2:47:47] pressure. Oh, he gives us all things.
[2:47:53] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory.
[2:47:57] Christianity.
[2:47:58] The
[2:47:59] message it was
[2:48:07] given. Shalom.
[2:48:11] He preached the message
[2:48:14] shalom. It is
[2:48:22] rest. He says he gives us all
[2:48:26] things to one. He gives us all things.
[2:48:30] All things are ours by
[2:48:33] Christ. So just let the pressure off.
[2:48:38] That's the only one way you can do it.
[2:48:50] Bring it to
[2:48:51] Christ. I assure
[2:48:54] you, by the time you rise
[2:48:57] up, you will be in the rest.
[2:49:01] Amen. Hallelujah. I don't care what it
[2:49:04] is. that has brought pressure in your
[2:49:08] life. Stay in
[2:49:11] Christ. You might join a
[2:49:14] church. It will still build up
[2:49:21] pressure because the Methodist church
[2:49:24] will tell
[2:49:25] you that they are right. The Baptist is
[2:49:29] wrong. The Baptist will say they are
[2:49:33] wrong, we are
[2:49:34] right. It just builds up
[2:49:37] pressure because you don't know where
[2:49:39] you are
[2:49:40] standing or you say I will join a
[2:49:42] message
[2:49:43] church. Maybe you have a
[2:49:46] gift. Maybe you know too much about the
[2:49:48] message. That's good to keep it up. But
[2:49:52] that's not what we are talking about.
[2:49:57] that will still build up
[2:50:01] pressure and you will blow
[2:50:04] up. Enter in Christ by the Holy Ghost.
[2:50:09] And if you ever come to
[2:50:11] Christ, just let off the
[2:50:13] pressure. It's all
[2:50:16] over. Settle it down. It's God's
[2:50:19] provided place of service.
[2:50:24] The name of the Lord is a mighty tower.
[2:50:28] The righteous
[2:50:29] run and is
[2:50:32] safe in time of
[2:50:35] sickness. When sickness
[2:50:38] strikes, the doctor
[2:50:40] says nothing else can be
[2:50:42] done. Don't build up
[2:50:46] pressure. Let off the
[2:50:48] pressure. Call your pastor. Let him
[2:50:51] anoint you with
[2:50:52] oil. Pray over you. The prayer of
[2:50:56] faith shall save the sick.
[2:51:00] That is what lets off the
[2:51:07] pressure. While you are in the
[2:51:10] refuge, you've got a right to
[2:51:13] anything that's in the
[2:51:16] refuge. And Christ is our refuge.
[2:51:20] Everything you have need
[2:51:22] of is in him.
[2:51:31] You say I wonder
[2:51:34] brother. He says you don't have to
[2:51:37] wonder. Just let off the pressure.
[2:51:40] Commit your guest to
[2:51:42] God on as if it was all over.
[2:51:48] [Music]
[2:51:50] Don't build up
[2:51:52] pressure. Let off the
[2:51:58] pressure. Cast your cares on
[2:52:01] him for he cares for you. Shall we stand
[2:52:05] on our feet? There was a sister. Abraham
[2:52:09] talked about meating off the pressure.
[2:52:13] This
[2:52:14] sister, she looked young about 30 years.
[2:52:18] But this sister was 60
[2:52:22] years. He said, "How do you
[2:52:26] sister?" You look
[2:52:28] 30. She said, "I have sons which are of
[2:52:31] your
[2:52:33] age." He said, "How do you do sister?
[2:52:45] say, "Brother, when I came to
[2:52:49] Christ, I asked
[2:52:51] myself if something is too big for
[2:52:56] me and it is too big for
[2:53:00] God, why do I have to worry about
[2:53:03] it? If it's already too big for
[2:53:07] me, I just give it to him.
[2:53:10] if it is too big for
[2:53:12] him. I don't know. So I just quit
[2:53:17] worrying and I cast all my cares upon
[2:53:21] [Music]
[2:53:22] you. But we have brother
[2:53:26] [Applause]
[2:53:27] [Music]
[2:53:28] sister. You have got old
[2:53:32] because you are young
[2:53:35] but you are getting wrinkles. You're a
[2:53:38] younger man. You want us to beat you?
[2:53:41] No.
[2:53:43] You are worrying for no good. Let off
[2:53:46] the
[2:53:48] pressure. Let off the pressure.
[2:53:52] Let off the pressure.
[2:53:54] Because you are in
[2:53:56] Christ. It is
[2:54:00] rest. Just stay within the
[2:54:04] boundaries. Amen.
[2:54:08] I have
[2:54:09] fin my
[2:54:14] soul in
[2:54:16] Christ
[2:54:20] alone
[2:54:23] knowing
[2:54:26] him in quietness.
[2:54:31] Hallelujah.

[3:10:37] [Music]
[3:10:41] home.
[3:10:44] [Music]
[3:10:52] Hallelujah. Before we close with a word
[3:10:55] of
[3:10:56] prayer, request brother Marvin, you
[3:10:59] project that
[3:11:00] song. Jesus is a refuge of our
[3:11:06] [Music]
[3:11:15] soul. You said Jesus is lover of our
[3:11:18] soul. Shall sing then give closing
[3:11:22] prayer.
[3:11:24] As you're meditating upon what we've
[3:11:26] heard this
[3:11:27] day, I believe the Lord has spoken to
[3:11:30] us. He has spoken to
[3:11:32] me. And just as the minister was saying
[3:11:35] that either you become better or you go
[3:11:39] in your works, but I trust each one of
[3:11:42] us. It's our desire always to see God
[3:11:45] speaking to us. Because the Bible say
[3:11:48] that those whom he love he correct, he
[3:11:50] rebuke and he
[3:11:52] chasten. So when the Lord comes and
[3:11:54] rebukes
[3:11:56] you is in fact you're on the better side
[3:12:01] because God is always and only concern
[3:12:04] about his children. God will never
[3:12:07] rebuke the neighbor's child. That is
[3:12:10] none of his business. And I believe that
[3:12:11] all of us are children of God. And
[3:12:14] personally always when the word comes
[3:12:16] and the Lord does not speak to me I go
[3:12:18] back say God indeed I'm bad off but when
[3:12:21] he comes and correct you brother what
[3:12:23] you have to do you say that this day
[3:12:25] when you hear my voice hard not your
[3:12:27] heart like our fathers did in the
[3:12:30] wilderness. So
[3:12:32] brethren, I believe that was the
[3:12:36] masterpiece. It was evangelctic sermon,
[3:12:39] but the Lord has spoken to us and we
[3:12:42] appreciate the Lord for
[3:12:45] that. Shalom. Yes sir.
[3:12:50] Jesus love.
[3:12:53] Oh my
[3:12:55] soul, lead me to thy borderless
[3:13:03] [Music]
[3:13:16] in his
[3:13:18] [Music]
[3:13:20] heart.
[3:13:21] Behold my
[3:13:24] sior
[3:13:26] high till the
[3:13:29] storm of
[3:13:33] life.
[3:13:35] Save to the heaven.
[3:13:42] Lord
[3:13:43] receive my soul.
[3:13:47] Brother,
[3:13:53] we have no other refuge.
[3:13:57] My
[3:13:59] helpless soul
[3:14:03] [Music]
[3:14:13] me and
[3:14:15] comfort me.
[3:14:18] All my trust on me each
[3:14:24] day. All my help from thee I
[3:14:33] [Music]
[3:14:39] bring the sh
[3:14:45] [Music]
[3:15:01] Thou, oh
[3:15:03] Christ, are all I
[3:15:07] want,
[3:15:12] all I
[3:15:14] want. Praise the fall and share the
[3:15:21] fame.
[3:15:23] He
[3:15:24] [Music]
[3:15:28] seek
[3:15:33] just thy name.
[3:15:37] I am
[3:15:39] L.
[3:15:44] Ious and full of
[3:15:53] sing of truth and
[3:15:57] grace.
[3:15:59] Jesus
[3:16:00] [Music]
[3:16:02] love my soul.
[3:16:05] Tell me to thy
[3:16:09] [Music]
[3:16:16] balance
[3:16:18] wrong by the tempest.
[3:16:23] [Music]
[3:16:26] Guide me home my
[3:16:32] savior till the storm of

[3:16:42] burning the
[3:16:46] heart or
[3:16:49] receive my soul. Oh,
[3:16:53] [Music]
[3:16:57] oh rock of ages for
[3:17:01] us. Lord, let us hide ourselves in
[3:17:05] thee. Lay thy water and thy
[3:17:08] blood from thy wounded
[3:17:14] side. Precious
[3:17:16] Jesus, we come before the throne of
[3:17:19] grace tonight.
[3:17:22] We thank you for the word that has gone
[3:17:24] forth,
[3:17:26] Lord. Lord, we are weighed on
[3:17:30] high and we are found Lord
[3:17:33] wanting but Lord
[3:17:37] Jesus. We have nowhere to
[3:17:40] run. You're the only hope that we have
[3:17:43] Lord. You're the hope of the hopeless.
[3:17:46] Lord the father of the
[3:17:49] fatherless. You say that you are the
[3:17:52] husband of the
[3:17:55] widows. You are our redeemer. Lord
[3:17:58] Jesus remember even one time when we are
[3:18:01] going the downward
[3:18:03] way. Thy grace found
[3:18:06] us. It's you who found us Lord
[3:18:10] Jesus. We thank you for the words of
[3:18:12] rebuke and correction.
[3:18:15] Lord, it's because you saw us straying,
[3:18:19] Lord. But Father, this day you have sent
[3:18:22] your word and you say that when you send
[3:18:25] your word, it will never go back to
[3:18:28] fighting, but thy word will accomplish
[3:18:31] its
[3:18:32] purpose. And you gave us a good example,
[3:18:35] Lord, just the way when you send the
[3:18:37] rain on the surface of the earth, that
[3:18:40] do not go back the same. It waters the
[3:18:43] earth for the soul to have a seed. Even
[3:18:47] this day, may the great Holy Spirit
[3:18:50] water this word in our
[3:18:52] soul. May you make us a better
[3:18:55] Christian. Prepare us first when coming
[3:18:58] Lord
[3:18:59] Jesus. You have showed us there's no way
[3:19:02] Lord we can play around and make it
[3:19:05] Lord. But this day Lord we are making a
[3:19:08] resolution Jesus. And Lord, we are
[3:19:11] deciding Lord. We having a purpose like
[3:19:14] Daniel of old who father who perhaps
[3:19:18] father perassed in his heart Lord Jesus
[3:19:21] not to defile himself with a king's meat
[3:19:24] where we have fallen short of your
[3:19:26] glory. We ask you to forgive us. We
[3:19:29] accept our faults that Lord we are
[3:19:31] wrong. Forgive our errors of omission
[3:19:34] and of commission. Forgive our iniquity
[3:19:37] and our sin. Forgive our father our
[3:19:41] backsliding this day. You said in
[3:19:44] Jeremiah that return all backsliding
[3:19:46] children for I'm married unto you. Lord
[3:19:51] Jesus, make us a better
[3:19:53] Christian. Revive us, Lord. Revive our
[3:19:57] moral
[3:19:58] values. Renew our strength.
[3:20:02] Father, you say it in your word that let
[3:20:05] those who lip lips no more Lord, but let
[3:20:08] them get
[3:20:09] healed. Father, Lord Jesus, may you heal
[3:20:13] each and every soul tonight. We thank
[3:20:16] you for the vessel you have used. We ask
[3:20:18] you that Lord revive his strength. May

[3:20:44] abide with him even as we leaving this
[3:20:46] place going back to our homes. We pray
[3:20:49] that we go with each one of us Lord. May
[3:20:51] the pillar of fire divide himself Lord

[3:22:00] receive their portion. Father, receive
[3:22:03] the glory. Remember our children who are

[3:22:08] God you'll provide for parents who are
