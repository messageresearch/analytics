[56:42] me and
[56:45] will
[56:48] [Music]
[56:51] again this is start of
[56:55] prayer precious loving

[57:37] all this in Jesus name we
[57:41] [Music]
[57:46] God bless you.
[57:51] Maybe let's first read before
[57:55] uh we are going to
[57:57] read from the book of
[58:01] Hebrews. Hebrews chapter 11 from verse
[58:03] 11- 16.
[58:12] Can I read? Amen. Um it says through
[58:16] faith also Sarah offered
[58:20] uh through faith also Sarah received
[58:22] strength to conceive seed and was
[58:24] delivered of a child when she was past
[58:27] age because she judged him faithful who
[58:30] had promised.
[58:32] Therefore sprung up even of one, and him
[58:35] as good as dead, so many as the stars of
[58:37] the sky in multitude, and as the sand,
[58:41] which is by the seashore
[58:43] innumerable. These all died in faith,
[58:46] not having received the promises, but
[58:47] having seen them a far off, and were
[58:50] persuaded of them, and embraced them,
[58:52] and confessed that they were strangers
[58:54] and pilgrims on the earth. For they that
[58:59] for they that say such things declare
[59:02] plainly that they seek a country. They
[59:06] seek a country. And truly if they had
[59:10] been mindful of that country from whence
[59:13] they came out they might have had
[59:14] opportunity to have returned. But now
[59:17] they desire better country that is
[59:19] unheavenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed
[59:22] to be called their God. And heath
[59:24] prepared for them a city.
[59:36] Amen.
[59:46] Fore! Foreign! Foreign!
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:28] Fore! Foreign!
[1:00:32] Foreign!
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:01:01] for a singer.
[1:01:13] [Music]
[1:01:17] Amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:01:21] seated. Uh I just this is what I wanted
[1:01:24] to say before I
[1:01:25] read. I would like to I'd like to thank
[1:01:29] pastor in his absence for giving me this
[1:01:31] opportunity.
[1:01:36] to stand before you
[1:01:39] today. I'm not the
[1:01:43] best and maybe I'll not be the right
[1:01:46] person to stand
[1:01:49] here, but I just thank God for his
[1:01:54] grace that he has allowed me to stand
[1:01:56] here.
[1:01:59] Uh so today I'm going to call my sermon
[1:02:04] uh persuaded by the
[1:02:10] word. Being persuaded being being
[1:02:12] persuaded means to be
[1:02:16] convinced. It means to be convinced or
[1:02:18] to be one
[1:02:23] over. Yeah. So when I say persuaded by
[1:02:25] the
[1:02:27] word, I mean being warned by the
[1:02:32] word, being taken over by the
[1:02:36] word. When when I look back at these
[1:02:38] verses I have
[1:02:40] read. These are very solid
[1:02:44] verses whereby when you read
[1:02:48] them, you can never exhaust
[1:02:51] them because they have a really big I
[1:02:55] feel they have something really big
[1:02:57] within them.
[1:03:06] uh maybe highlight.
[1:03:08] I wanted to highlight verse
[1:03:22] 30. And then it says, "These all died in
[1:03:27] faith, not having received the
[1:03:30] promises, but having seen them a far off
[1:03:33] and were persuaded of them,
[1:03:37] and have embraced them and confessed
[1:03:40] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:46] earth. Amen. And then verse uh verse 15
[1:03:50] it says and truly if they had been
[1:03:51] mindful of that country from when they
[1:03:53] came
[1:03:56] back they might have had opportunity to
[1:03:59] have returned.
[1:04:03] I mean that's why I I I chose that that
[1:04:05] title persuaded by the word
[1:04:10] because these people they they were
[1:04:13] really persuaded and confessed to be
[1:04:15] strangers on this
[1:04:20] earth. As I said being persuaded means
[1:04:23] to be one
[1:04:26] over or ought to be
[1:04:29] convinced. Maybe someone introduces a
[1:04:31] new idea to
[1:04:33] you and then you buy it. A completely
[1:04:36] new
[1:04:38] idea. Either I've convinced you by my
[1:04:43] words or by
[1:04:46] anything but most times it's a very new
[1:04:51] idea and then persuaded by the
[1:04:56] word. So I asked myself what is the
[1:04:59] word?
[1:05:01] What is this word which can persuade
[1:05:05] people? What is this word which can make
[1:05:07] people lose their minds and say they are
[1:05:09] strangers on this
[1:05:11] earth? Do you notice? Do you notice that
[1:05:14] that is a very big
[1:05:17] thing? You know someone telling you that
[1:05:19] you are seed of
[1:05:21] God and in yourself maybe you don't feel
[1:05:25] it.
[1:05:27] Someone tells you this is not where I'm
[1:05:29] supposed to
[1:05:31] be. There is somewhere we are
[1:05:33] going but it never looks like we on a
[1:05:38] journey because we are ever stationary
[1:05:42] sometimes. And some people even maybe
[1:05:45] they had faith that Jesus would return
[1:05:47] sometime
[1:05:52] back but they see they are so stagnant.
[1:05:57] What kind of word is
[1:05:58] this which can touch someone's
[1:06:02] heart which can change their lives
[1:06:05] completely which can change the way they
[1:06:09] act which can change what they
[1:06:11] desire which can change everything about
[1:06:14] their
[1:06:15] lives. I believe each of us when we look
[1:06:18] at our
[1:06:19] lives maybe when we look
[1:06:23] back we have changed
[1:06:25] completely and if you haven't changed
[1:06:28] then you have to look back at the word
[1:06:29] you're
[1:06:32] following I I wanted to bring it to
[1:06:36] this uh in Mark
[1:06:43] 4:20 I wish you could open to
[1:06:49] uh Mark
[1:06:51] [Music]
[1:06:54] 4:20 I'm going to read only one verse
[1:06:57] and it says and these are they which are
[1:06:59] sown on good ground such as hear the
[1:07:02] word and receive it and bring forth
[1:07:04] fruits some 30folds some 60 and some 100
[1:07:22] So here this is a parable of the ser who
[1:07:24] went out to
[1:07:27] sow. And so when he went out to sow, he
[1:07:29] saw on different
[1:07:31] grounds. But there was a ground where he
[1:07:34] sowed. He saw the
[1:07:36] seed and it produced some 34, some 64.
[1:07:45] which means there were
[1:07:47] fruits. There were fruits out of this
[1:07:51] ground. And and and when this parable is
[1:07:54] explained, that seed was the
[1:07:57] word. And then the good ground were the
[1:07:59] good the
[1:08:02] hearts, the hearts which could receive
[1:08:05] the which could receive the
[1:08:07] word. And then in in John chapter 1
[1:08:11] verse one, we all know that scripture.
[1:08:13] It says in the beginning was the word
[1:08:14] and the word was with God and the word
[1:08:19] was then how the word became flesh
[1:08:26] and so we can see that the word at this
[1:08:28] point was a person.
[1:08:34] The word is a person which came
[1:08:37] down and dwelt among the
[1:08:40] people. Can you imagine staying with the
[1:08:44] word something which has to change you
[1:08:46] but you live with it every
[1:08:49] day and some people couldn't see
[1:08:52] it but he lived among the
[1:08:55] people and those he called he changed
[1:08:57] them and he he gave them new ideas and
[1:09:00] like Peter
[1:09:02] [Music]
[1:09:05] how we told them they would be fishes of
[1:09:09] men. So then that word which came among
[1:09:14] us, this word was
[1:09:17] tried before this man was
[1:09:20] killed. He had to be tried before many
[1:09:23] before many judges. Let me
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:28] say I like it. I like it what the
[1:09:30] preacher from South Africa
[1:09:33] said. He had to be tried and asked many
[1:09:38] times, "Are you the son of
[1:09:40] God? Are you the king of the
[1:09:43] Jews?" Ask him several
[1:09:46] times. And after all that, you say,
[1:09:48] "This man has has done nothing
[1:09:51] [Music]
[1:09:53] wrong." And then he's asked
[1:09:55] again and again to find out who exactly
[1:09:59] is this
[1:10:00] guy. Satan didn't know the whole plan of
[1:10:03] God. The whole plan of God is that Jesus
[1:10:06] had to be proven
[1:10:11] worthy. He knew that his life was going
[1:10:14] to go
[1:10:15] out and that is the life we are living
[1:10:18] by. So whenever he went there and and
[1:10:21] and this man would wash his hands and
[1:10:23] say this man has no fault on
[1:10:30] him. And actually when you read it
[1:10:33] closer, you notice that this man would
[1:10:35] say, "I have no problem with this
[1:10:39] man, but you kill
[1:10:42] him." It was so
[1:10:46] funny. Why would an innocent man be
[1:10:48] killed?
[1:10:51] But he had to be killed for
[1:10:53] us. God God did all that on
[1:10:57] purpose. So that in our day no man no
[1:10:59] one can claim that Jesus was
[1:11:03] guilty because even after proving that
[1:11:05] he was innocent they said kill him
[1:11:10] anyhow. So the Bible says in in uh John
[1:11:15] chapter 12 verse 24
[1:11:25] It says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:11:27] you, except a corn of wheat fall into
[1:11:29] the ground and die, it abideth alone.
[1:11:32] But if it die, it bringeth forth much
[1:11:45] fruit. So this was actually This was
[1:11:48] Jesus who gave this
[1:11:50] parable. He was literally saying unless
[1:11:53] I
[1:11:55] die, my life can't come into
[1:11:58] you, unless I am killed because unless
[1:12:02] that seed fall and and
[1:12:04] and
[1:12:09] die, it abideth
[1:12:12] alone. But now Jesus had to give his
[1:12:15] life.
[1:12:17] He had to give his life for the
[1:12:20] church. And that is the word which comes
[1:12:22] to someone's
[1:12:24] heart and someone feels convinced beyond
[1:12:29] doubt that this is the
[1:12:31] truth and people give their necks for
[1:12:34] that
[1:12:37] word. Hallelujah. Amen. So that is the
[1:12:41] word. And then why I also say persuaded
[1:12:44] by the Lord, it means that there are two
[1:12:46] forces
[1:12:52] fighting. There are two forces
[1:12:55] fighting. We we can see that in
[1:12:59] uh in Galatians 5:1 17 it talks about it
[1:13:04] talks about how the flesh lusts against
[1:13:06] the spirit.
[1:13:10] So these are two things
[1:13:13] fighting. The spirit lusts after the
[1:13:16] things of
[1:13:19] God, but this body laughs for the things
[1:13:22] of this
[1:13:23] world. So there's a fight inside every
[1:13:27] one of
[1:13:28] us. the world trying to overcome
[1:13:31] us. And also when the word comes to our
[1:13:35] hearts, we feel like the word wants to
[1:13:38] overcome
[1:13:39] us. But then sometimes people are
[1:13:43] unstable until they fail to choose where
[1:13:45] they want to
[1:13:47] go. They failed to choose what they want
[1:13:49] to
[1:13:51] do. Otherwise if everyone was following
[1:13:54] maybe the voice of the
[1:13:58] spirit maybe they would have been
[1:14:00] growing.
[1:14:02] We can see that most of us were called
[1:14:03] from very many things which we
[1:14:07] left when we're in the world and we f we
[1:14:10] fed our souls on the things of the
[1:14:14] word and and followed what our bodies
[1:14:16] were
[1:14:19] saying and and ignored what our spirits
[1:14:24] wanted. Even the seeds of God are like
[1:14:26] that.
[1:14:28] Even when you want to do good, sometimes
[1:14:31] most times your body is against
[1:14:38] you. Brother said that his biggest enemy
[1:14:40] is William
[1:14:46] Brandham. Just imagine the prophet
[1:14:50] himself having such a
[1:14:52] problem. It is not a mistake that it
[1:14:55] happens to us also.
[1:14:58] It happens to every one of
[1:15:00] us. Even even where I've read from about
[1:15:03] these people how they saw themselves
[1:15:05] strangers on this
[1:15:10] earth, it doesn't mean
[1:15:12] that maybe their bodies failed or
[1:15:16] something because the Bible says that
[1:15:20] they died in
[1:15:23] faith. They died believing that
[1:15:28] So I want I want to read a quote
[1:15:32] here. It's in question and
[1:15:36] answers. Someone said he said well since
[1:15:39] uh me received the Holy
[1:15:43] Spirit. He said there's been two dogs
[1:15:45] inside of me and one of them is black
[1:15:47] and one of them is a white dog.
[1:15:52] He said they urge you all the
[1:15:54] time. Say they growl and fight at one at
[1:15:58] one
[1:15:59] another and say the white dog wants me
[1:16:01] to do
[1:16:03] good and the black dog wants me to do
[1:16:06] bad. So this was a man filled with the
[1:16:09] Holy
[1:16:10] Spirit. A man everyone can look up
[1:16:13] to and say I want to be like that man.
[1:16:17] But this is the man himself
[1:16:19] complaining that there's there's like a
[1:16:22] black and a white
[1:16:24] dog and they are fighting against each
[1:16:27] other that is a spirit and a
[1:16:31] body and then and then and then they
[1:16:33] asked him well chief which one of them
[1:16:35] wins the
[1:16:39] fight. Then he said he said that depends
[1:16:43] on which chief feeds the most.
[1:16:54] Then say, "So I think that's a good
[1:16:55] answer
[1:16:59] here." So this man is actually maybe he
[1:17:03] was perplexed. He has the Holy Spirit
[1:17:07] and but still we see that he needs the
[1:17:11] word. He needs the word in his life.
[1:17:14] This word is
[1:17:17] alive. As I said that Jesus died and and
[1:17:20] and his life was given to the
[1:17:24] church that on our own we can't we can't
[1:17:27] live on our own
[1:17:30] life. Paul said that he can't depend on
[1:17:32] his own
[1:17:35] righteousness because if it was our own
[1:17:37] righteousness
[1:17:39] God would have been so unjust to judge
[1:17:42] Cain.
[1:17:45] You can imagine that uh brother Brandham
[1:17:47] said that Kane was a religious
[1:17:53] man. Yeah. But uh just because he didn't
[1:17:57] have a revelation of the
[1:18:01] word and so he offered a a wrong
[1:18:04] sacrifice.
[1:18:10] So uh here I want
[1:18:13] to I want to uh show you a few men who
[1:18:18] who are actually persuaded by the
[1:18:23] word. Uh one of them is
[1:18:27] Job. Uh we are going to read in Job
[1:18:30] chapter 19.
[1:19:01] As we know, Job was one who was really
[1:19:08] tried. Job was tried in thick and thin.
[1:19:15] You know, one time the devil was moving
[1:19:17] on
[1:19:18] earth and then and then
[1:19:21] uh and then he goes back before God and
[1:19:24] God asked him, "Have you seen my
[1:19:29] servant?" Let's read that in Job chapter
[1:19:36] 19. Actually, that is in is in some
[1:19:38] other scripture. I just want to
[1:19:51] In Job chapter 19, I shall read from
[1:19:53] verse
[1:19:55] 25. It says that for I know that my
[1:19:58] redeemer
[1:19:59] liveth and he shall stand at the last at
[1:20:02] the latter day upon the earth.
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:12] And after my skin worms destroy this
[1:20:14] body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.
[1:20:27] So Job was one who has really tried in
[1:20:32] everything. But the devil goes before
[1:20:34] God and tells God that Job is just
[1:20:37] righteous because of what God has given
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:46] him. But we can see there's a difference
[1:20:49] in in in Job's life.
[1:20:52] Job was one who was
[1:20:55] convinced. You know in the first in the
[1:20:57] first verse we read it says that those
[1:20:59] people died even without receiving the
[1:21:05] promise. Which means that these people
[1:21:07] are most likely either poor or maybe
[1:21:11] they didn't have anything
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:16] much. But there was something in their
[1:21:18] hearts which had life.
[1:21:22] There was a hope in their
[1:21:24] hearts. The Bible talks about those who
[1:21:26] don't have Christ, they literally don't
[1:21:28] have
[1:21:30] hope
[1:21:32] because what can they hope
[1:21:35] in? They have nothing to hope in. So the
[1:21:38] devil thought maybe Job was like one of
[1:21:42] them since God has given him all these
[1:21:46] things. Maybe he has decided to trust in
[1:21:48] God.
[1:21:51] And then the devil comes one by one
[1:21:52] sweeping everything
[1:21:55] away. And that is what Satan does in our
[1:21:58] lives. Many times we go through hard
[1:22:01] trials
[1:22:02] and and we think God has left
[1:22:05] us. Sometimes Satan wants to prove by
[1:22:08] himself that these are actually children
[1:22:10] of
[1:22:12] God. Because being a child of God is not
[1:22:15] only about coming to
[1:22:17] church. It's about the life which you
[1:22:20] have in
[1:22:22] you. What life do you live when you go
[1:22:25] out? What life do you live in your
[1:22:29] home? When someone enters your
[1:22:32] home, can they see Christ without
[1:22:35] talking to
[1:22:37] anyone? You know, there's an atmosphere
[1:22:39] which is created around the children of
[1:22:41] God.
[1:22:43] that you can walk into a place and walk
[1:22:47] out. You'll notice that there's
[1:22:49] something different in
[1:22:50] there. You can talk to someone and mess
[1:22:53] with them and be like, "This person is
[1:22:57] different." Sometimes the devil wants to
[1:23:00] prove that by
[1:23:01] himself. So Satan comes to
[1:23:04] Job and he takes away everything he had,
[1:23:08] every hope he had, every
[1:23:10] happiness. You know, Job had no fault
[1:23:13] before
[1:23:15] God. Job was
[1:23:17] righteous. Even God would bear a
[1:23:19] testimony of
[1:23:21] him. In addition to being righteous, he
[1:23:23] used to sacrifice for his
[1:23:27] family. Because he knew his children
[1:23:29] were not
[1:23:31] righteous. Whenever they would go for a
[1:23:33] party after, he would sacrifice for
[1:23:38] them. Which means that Job was most
[1:23:41] probably very right with
[1:23:45] God. And then Satan tries to sweep him
[1:23:47] and off his
[1:23:49] legs and takes
[1:23:52] everything. And Job keeps quiet for very
[1:23:54] many
[1:23:56] days. And many people come to him
[1:23:58] telling him that maybe he has sinned. He
[1:24:00] should
[1:24:03] repent. They tell him, "Job, have you
[1:24:05] done
[1:24:06] this? Job have you done this?"
[1:24:09] and he says no.
[1:24:12] And then let let's look at what he said.
[1:24:14] He said that I know my redeemer
[1:24:17] lives and he shall stand at the latter
[1:24:19] day upon the
[1:24:21] earth. And though and though after my
[1:24:24] skin worms destroy his body, yet in my
[1:24:26] flesh shall I see
[1:24:32] God. So here we can notice that Job was
[1:24:36] fully persuaded
[1:24:39] He said, "No matter what you take away
[1:24:40] from me, no matter what sorrows you
[1:24:43] befall on
[1:24:44] me, no matter what you bring upon my
[1:24:48] life." Job goes back and reads the
[1:24:51] Bible. He notices that uh that that he
[1:24:55] will see God one
[1:24:58] day. He notices that he has not done
[1:25:00] anything
[1:25:02] wrong. He just knows that he will see
[1:25:04] God one
[1:25:05] day. And he knows that my redeemer
[1:25:09] lives. That's how we should be
[1:25:12] today. Many times things come across our
[1:25:16] ways. And what we do? We go to our
[1:25:18] friends and we tell them this
[1:25:22] this whenever I'm pressed
[1:25:24] down, I go back to the Bible because
[1:25:27] this Bible has everything you need.
[1:25:31] It doesn't matter what condition you're
[1:25:34] in as long as you get
[1:25:37] persuaded. The best thing you can do is
[1:25:40] to get
[1:25:42] persuaded. There is something I left
[1:25:44] out at the
[1:25:47] beginning. Uh we realize that these
[1:25:49] people actually they had
[1:25:52] faith and they could not be persuaded by
[1:25:55] the things they are
[1:25:57] seeing. But the Bible says that they
[1:25:59] were seeing something.
[1:26:02] But it doesn't mean it doesn't mean they
[1:26:04] were seeing these things with physical
[1:26:07] eyes. These people had faith and they
[1:26:09] were looking at a city to
[1:26:12] come whose builder and maker is
[1:26:16] God. They didn't look at what they had
[1:26:19] around. After all, the Bible said that
[1:26:22] they didn't even get the
[1:26:25] promises. But that means they were
[1:26:27] having faith.
[1:26:29] And then the Bible tells us that faith
[1:26:31] comes by
[1:26:35] hearing. And by hearing the word of
[1:26:38] God. So hearing the word of God can help
[1:26:41] you actually to grow that seed within
[1:26:47] you. When that seed grows within
[1:26:50] you, you start noticing that you're not
[1:26:53] of this country.
[1:26:55] You start noticing that something is
[1:26:57] wrong around
[1:26:58] here. You notice that this is not your
[1:27:02] home. If you've been from the world, you
[1:27:04] feel like coming back real
[1:27:09] quick. Uh I remember one of the one of
[1:27:12] the questions which
[1:27:13] uh
[1:27:15] uh pastor was asked, pastor
[1:27:19] Keith, they asked him, "What would you
[1:27:21] say to the younger cave?
[1:27:27] He said I would I would ask him to pray
[1:27:31] more. I would ask him to mean
[1:27:35] business. I would ask him to do this and
[1:27:38] that. So when that seed inside you
[1:27:41] grows, you start noticing that there are
[1:27:43] better things you would have
[1:27:46] done. You start noticing that maybe you
[1:27:49] wasted time out there.
[1:27:54] and then you get to
[1:27:56] business. But that only happens when
[1:27:59] you're persuaded with the
[1:28:01] word. And so the more we feed on the
[1:28:07] word, the more we get
[1:28:09] convinced like that seed which fell in
[1:28:12] the in the good ground and some produced
[1:28:13] 30 some 64.
[1:28:18] I believe that people have different
[1:28:20] measures of faith because of how they
[1:28:21] feed on the
[1:28:27] word. Let us learn to feed on the
[1:28:36] word. Another man was
[1:28:41] Abraham.
[1:28:44] Abraham was a
[1:28:47] man who lived in the land of
[1:28:50] Ur and his his parents
[1:28:54] died and now he's there maybe having a
[1:28:56] hope of of staying there and uh getting
[1:28:59] land for his great grandchildren and
[1:29:05] something. But now God comes to him and
[1:29:07] tells
[1:29:10] him. God tells him to
[1:29:12] move. Can you imagine what do you think
[1:29:15] in Abraham really made him to
[1:29:20] move? I I believe that Abraham was a
[1:29:23] real seed of
[1:29:25] God. The first word he had
[1:29:30] believed and and there are very many
[1:29:33] people who are like
[1:29:34] that. Uh in in Genesis chapter 12 verse
[1:29:38] one it
[1:29:39] says now the Lord said unto Abraham get
[1:29:42] thee out of thy country and from thy
[1:29:53] kindred. house and to a land that I will
[1:29:56] show
[1:30:00] thee, and I'll make of thee a great
[1:30:02] nation, and I'll bless thee, and make
[1:30:04] thy name
[1:30:07] great, and thou shalt be a father of
[1:30:10] many
[1:30:15] generations, and I'll bless them that
[1:30:18] will bless
[1:30:19] thee, and cast them that cth thee.
[1:30:25] And in this shall all the families of
[1:30:26] the earth be
[1:30:29] blessed. So Abraham departed as the Lord
[1:30:32] had spoken unto
[1:30:36] him and Lord went within with him and
[1:30:38] Abraham was 75 years old when he
[1:30:41] departed from
[1:30:45] her. We can see Abraham was another
[1:30:48] person who has touched in his
[1:30:51] heart. That word which God came which
[1:30:54] God told
[1:30:56] him it immediately touched his
[1:30:59] heart and he noticed he he had to
[1:31:03] leave. He was in a wrong
[1:31:06] place. But God doesn't take you from a a
[1:31:10] good place to a worse
[1:31:13] place. God always takes you to a better
[1:31:15] place.
[1:31:18] So many times in our lives, there are
[1:31:19] things we don't want to move away
[1:31:23] from. When that word comes to
[1:31:26] us, it comes to us in
[1:31:29] power. And I believe it comes to us with
[1:31:31] the power of
[1:31:34] love. It's it's only by love that we
[1:31:37] could be
[1:31:40] saved. Because after all, we are all
[1:31:42] sinners.
[1:31:46] And even if I leave this, I have already
[1:31:47] done
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:50] it. So I believe that the word comes
[1:31:53] with
[1:31:54] love. It comes with a a certain kind of
[1:32:01] grace. So
[1:32:04] uh when when we when the world tells us
[1:32:06] to leave certain
[1:32:09] things, sometimes we harden our
[1:32:12] hearts. And when you harden your heart,
[1:32:14] it means that now the word can't win
[1:32:20] you. Jesus talked about those who
[1:32:22] hardened their hearts by
[1:32:26] themselves and they refused to move away
[1:32:28] from what they were
[1:32:32] doing. And then in in in uh in the
[1:32:36] sermon here, we have no continuing seat.
[1:32:38] It says
[1:32:40] it I think of when Abraham left the city
[1:32:43] of
[1:32:45] Ur and the land of the children. He was
[1:32:48] sitting a city whose builder and maker
[1:32:50] was
[1:32:54] God. Now there was something in Abraham
[1:32:57] that he could that he could see that
[1:32:59] that he could see that great city of Ur.
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:10] Uh it says and by instinct or by the
[1:33:13] leading of the Holy Spirit he hunted
[1:33:15] that city whose build and maker was God.
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:25] So he so journed in a strange land
[1:33:26] professed to the pilgrims to be pilgrims
[1:33:29] and
[1:33:33] strangers and seeking a city and
[1:33:36] dwelling in tents with Abraham, Isaac,
[1:33:39] Jacob and so
[1:33:46] forth. So Abraham actually left his
[1:33:49] homeland
[1:33:52] and he was going to a strange
[1:33:53] land. He literally left all the riches
[1:33:56] of his
[1:33:58] father and he was now going to a strange
[1:34:02] land where he doesn't know where he's
[1:34:04] going. He doesn't know where it's
[1:34:07] located. But I can say that when you
[1:34:10] follow
[1:34:11] God, you don't have to know what's ahead
[1:34:14] of
[1:34:15] you because what's ahead of you is
[1:34:17] perfect.
[1:34:20] So you don't have to say if I go for
[1:34:24] service maybe I'll get an
[1:34:28] accident. Don't think like
[1:34:31] that. God knows what's ahead of
[1:34:35] you. You can imagine this man literally
[1:34:38] denied his
[1:34:41] homeland. And and here it says that they
[1:34:44] were sleeping in tents.
[1:34:47] Can you imagine living maybe a very big
[1:34:50] comfortable
[1:34:53] place and then he goes just wandering
[1:34:59] around looking for a land which he
[1:35:02] doesn't know
[1:35:07] uh in in Philippians
[1:35:13] 3:7-9 it says that But what things were
[1:35:17] gained to me? Those I counted lost for
[1:35:24] Christ. Let me just read. But what
[1:35:26] things were gain to me? Those I counted
[1:35:28] loss for Christ. Yeah. Doubtless and I
[1:35:30] count all things but loss for the
[1:35:33] excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[1:35:35] Jesus my savior for whom I have suffered
[1:35:38] the loss of all things. and do count
[1:35:40] them dang but and do count them but dang
[1:35:45] that I may win Christ and be found in
[1:35:47] him not having mine own righteousness
[1:35:50] which is of the law but that which is
[1:35:52] through faith of Christ the
[1:35:53] righteousness which is of God by faith.
[1:35:57] So this is
[1:35:59] Paul is another who was persuaded in his
[1:36:03] heart. Paul is a man who had much
[1:36:07] education, maybe more than any of us
[1:36:10] here. I don't know how the education
[1:36:12] was,
[1:36:14] but Paul was a man who had a he had a
[1:36:17] basis of his
[1:36:20] life. Maybe even if Paul was just from
[1:36:23] the church, he would have riches to
[1:36:24] continue
[1:36:27] with. I can say he had an enough
[1:36:30] knowledge to make him more wealth.
[1:36:35] But when Paul met the pillar of
[1:36:37] fire, when he was when he was still soul
[1:36:40] by then, when he met that when he met
[1:36:43] that pillar of
[1:36:44] fire and he asked and he asked it, "Who
[1:36:47] are
[1:36:48] you?" And he said, "I am Christ to your
[1:36:52] persecutor." At that very point, I
[1:36:56] believe Paul was a man who really loved
[1:36:57] God.
[1:36:59] Paul was a man who did all he can to
[1:37:01] protect the name of
[1:37:03] God. I can still say Saul when he was
[1:37:06] still
[1:37:07] Saul, he had a really good
[1:37:10] heart. He had a heart for
[1:37:12] God only that he was following the wrong
[1:37:15] thing. But when Paul met that pillar of
[1:37:19] fire and he said, "Who are you?" Because
[1:37:22] he could see it clearly. And then he
[1:37:25] says, "I'm Jesus you're persecuting.
[1:37:29] Paul immediately got I don't know how he
[1:37:35] felt but I'm sure he really
[1:37:38] screamed all along he thought he was
[1:37:40] worshiping
[1:37:42] God all along he thought he had studied
[1:37:45] his theology to come and serve God to
[1:37:47] the
[1:37:49] best and maybe Paul was sure that when
[1:37:52] Jesus comes he will be he would be uh
[1:37:55] maybe credited for for for protecting
[1:37:58] the
[1:38:03] word and these were keepers of the
[1:38:07] law. But when Paul made that pillar of
[1:38:10] fire and then the person who prayed for
[1:38:13] him was one of those he was
[1:38:17] persecuting and even they baptized
[1:38:20] him. Paul noticed that this God uh these
[1:38:24] people were serving was a true God.
[1:38:29] Immediately Paul got so
[1:38:32] convinced and he says, "But what things
[1:38:34] which were gained to
[1:38:36] me, I counted loss for
[1:38:39] Christ, completely
[1:38:41] lost." Can you imagine someone giving up
[1:38:44] their life's
[1:38:47] plan? The only way you can do that is
[1:38:50] when you are fully persuaded.
[1:38:53] And what we need today is to get
[1:38:56] convinced. We need to get convinced by
[1:38:58] the word. We need to sink deeper in the
[1:39:02] word because you can't finish what is
[1:39:07] here. Uh last time I was talking to
[1:39:11] Shem and they were talking about a
[1:39:13] certain a certain someone
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:18] by all of us were saying whenever we go
[1:39:20] back we get a new thing. We get a new
[1:39:22] thing.
[1:39:25] That happens when you read the
[1:39:27] word. You can never exhaust it
[1:39:31] completely. So he counted all those
[1:39:34] things are
[1:39:38] loss and then he says that he counted
[1:39:41] them d that I may win
[1:39:45] Christ. There are many things in our
[1:39:47] lives we have to count as d.
[1:39:51] There are many things in our lives we
[1:39:53] need to give
[1:39:55] up. There are many things we hold on to
[1:39:57] as life to
[1:40:01] us. They are suffocating our spiritual
[1:40:04] life. I believe Saul's education was
[1:40:08] suffocating his spiritual
[1:40:11] life. It was real. It was really
[1:40:13] suffocating
[1:40:15] him until until it couldn't hold
[1:40:18] anymore until until Jesus had to meet
[1:40:22] him and change him.
[1:40:25] Jesus has to meet each one of
[1:40:27] us and change us.
[1:40:34] And then another one was uh
[1:40:37] was David.
[1:40:40] I believe David was one also who was
[1:40:44] persuaded that even when David would
[1:40:47] sin, David knew that my God can't leave
[1:40:51] me. I believe David knew his
[1:40:55] position. Many times he go
[1:40:58] astray and we we hold on to ourselves
[1:41:01] and we cry on our own.
[1:41:06] Something I noticed is that that crying,
[1:41:10] if you're crying on your own, it is a
[1:41:11] loss for
[1:41:14] you. You rather spend that time going to
[1:41:20] work. God is not pleased with
[1:41:27] unbelief. Now, when David noticed
[1:41:30] that whenever David would go against
[1:41:33] God,
[1:41:35] David used to go before
[1:41:37] God because he was so
[1:41:42] persuaded. And then he says in uh in
[1:41:45] Psalms chapter
[1:41:48] 23 verse
[1:42:02] 4 Psalms 23 verse4 says yeah though I
[1:42:07] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:42:09] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:42:10] with me thy road and thy staff they
[1:42:12] comfort
[1:42:20] me. David was talking about walking a
[1:42:23] rough
[1:42:25] path. David was convinced in his
[1:42:28] heart that God can't leave me. David was
[1:42:32] persuaded in his heart that no matter
[1:42:35] what
[1:42:36] happens, no matter what I do, God won't
[1:42:39] leave me. Whenever I would come before
[1:42:41] God,
[1:42:42] You tell God, I am but a
[1:42:45] man. I'm a man born of a woman. David
[1:42:49] noticed the grace of
[1:42:50] God. He noticed that he found favor
[1:42:53] before
[1:42:54] God. And he will just come before God
[1:42:57] and say, "God, I know I am persuaded
[1:42:59] that you're
[1:43:02] able. I'm persuaded that you're able to
[1:43:04] forgive
[1:43:05] me. I'm persuaded that you're able to
[1:43:07] carry me.
[1:43:10] I'm persuaded that even if I
[1:43:12] fail, you won't
[1:43:15] fail. I believe we all have to come to
[1:43:17] an an
[1:43:20] understanding that God can't
[1:43:22] fail. And the Bible says uh Jesus talks
[1:43:25] about those who come to him, he will in
[1:43:26] no wise cast them
[1:43:30] away. But many times we fear to
[1:43:33] go. It's because we are not
[1:43:36] convinced. Who is God to
[1:43:39] you? Jesus asked his disciples, who do
[1:43:42] men say that I
[1:43:45] am? And then they said, some say you're
[1:43:47] this, some say that. Then he said, who
[1:43:50] do you say I
[1:43:52] am? And then Peter was inspired and he
[1:43:54] said, you're the son of
[1:43:57] God. So today I can say that who is God
[1:44:00] to
[1:44:02] you? How has God revealed himself to
[1:44:04] you?
[1:44:06] You know there are people who have a
[1:44:07] gift of
[1:44:08] healing but they believe beyond doubt
[1:44:11] that when they lay their hands on
[1:44:14] you that you will heal. You'll get well.
[1:44:19] But those people can cry for
[1:44:20] food. Maybe they don't have enough faith
[1:44:23] that God can give them
[1:44:25] food. Maybe God has revealed himself to
[1:44:28] them. Maybe they know God is a healer.
[1:44:33] But us as believers, we know that God is
[1:44:37] everything. God is everything. We don't
[1:44:39] have to go to him because maybe I need
[1:44:42] food, then I can't ask for
[1:44:48] this. God should be our
[1:44:51] friend. And I believe that God can
[1:44:53] reveal himself to us in any
[1:44:56] way. God can convince you. God can put
[1:44:59] you in a situation which can convince
[1:45:03] you that he can do anything for you. I
[1:45:07] believe that God can do for me
[1:45:09] anything even when I feel as low as
[1:45:13] low. I go back in the Bible and I read
[1:45:16] that I won't leave you
[1:45:19] comfortless. I will be with
[1:45:21] you. I will carry you through.
[1:45:25] It's because I am
[1:45:27] persuaded. God has taken me through
[1:45:29] things that when something
[1:45:33] comes, however long it takes
[1:45:36] me, I remember my experience and I
[1:45:40] remember that I am really
[1:45:42] persuaded. I am sure that you won't fail
[1:45:44] me and I'm sure that I'm sure that God
[1:45:47] won't fail me in any way.
[1:45:51] And and the last one I wanted to read is
[1:45:53] in the book of
[1:45:58] Philippians chapter 3 verse seven.
[1:46:07] Uh sorry we already read that it is
[1:46:16] uh maybe I didn't write
[1:46:20] it but uh it was Timothy it's in the
[1:46:23] book of I think first
[1:46:25] Timothy where Timothy was
[1:46:28] confessing he says that I know who I
[1:46:31] have believed
[1:46:34] I am fully
[1:46:36] persuaded that he is able to to to take
[1:46:40] which I've committed against
[1:46:45] him. So he was completely persuaded
[1:46:50] in today. We really need to get
[1:46:53] persuaded. If you feel you're not yet
[1:46:56] persuaded, go back to the word, read the
[1:47:00] word. go deeper in the
[1:47:03] word. You can't exhaust the
[1:47:06] word. You may not realize that you're
[1:47:09] growing. You may not notice that that
[1:47:10] seed inside you is
[1:47:12] growing. But there's going to come a
[1:47:14] time. Maybe you'll come to church one
[1:47:17] day. You may be silent the whole
[1:47:20] service and that one
[1:47:22] word will just make you
[1:47:25] scream because that seed is growing.
[1:47:28] Your life is growing.
[1:47:31] I remember pastor preached a sermon of
[1:47:33] you can never be the
[1:47:36] same. As long as you stay under the word
[1:47:39] and you subject yourself under the word,
[1:47:41] you may never notice what is happening.
[1:47:44] You may never notice what is changing
[1:47:46] but there is something changing in your
[1:47:49] life. When you hear the word of God,
[1:47:52] this is something I learned from
[1:47:54] pastor. Even if you can't believe
[1:47:56] it, say amen, I believe it.
[1:48:00] Even if it's too hard for you, say amen.
[1:48:04] I remember
[1:48:06] during our pastor used to most times ask
[1:48:09] the main brothers they were called back
[1:48:15] then are those who are really active in
[1:48:17] the
[1:48:18] service and then he would he would bring
[1:48:21] a few to church during when others at
[1:48:23] their
[1:48:27] homes so that they can cheer the
[1:48:30] word. You know when you share the word
[1:48:33] it appetizes the
[1:48:35] preacher. So we used to come and say
[1:48:37] amen.
[1:48:39] Amen. But me and myself seriously
[1:48:43] sometimes I wasn't that
[1:48:46] amen just say it sometimes. But in me I
[1:48:50] knew that I'm saying amen with my with
[1:48:53] my
[1:48:54] mouth. God is going to recognize my
[1:48:58] faith and feed that seed inside of me.
[1:49:02] You don't have to feel anything to say
[1:49:06] amen. When when they say something and
[1:49:08] you want
[1:49:09] it, just say amen. I receive it. Amen.
[1:49:13] Say amen means I believe
[1:49:15] it. Be it unto
[1:49:18] me, I receive it. And that's how we
[1:49:22] should be as
[1:49:23] believers. Just like that, you're going
[1:49:25] to realize that your heart is taken
[1:49:27] away.
[1:49:29] You ask yourself how he left the things
[1:49:31] of the
[1:49:33] world. As I finish, I wanted to give a
[1:49:37] testimony. Uh back then in
[1:49:40] COVID, I was a really different person
[1:49:43] from what I am right now. Completely
[1:49:47] different. Those who saw me can believe
[1:49:51] me now. I was different. I was not
[1:49:54] anything close to this.
[1:49:58] I was completely a not even a nobody but
[1:50:04] nothing. I couldn't stand and talk
[1:50:07] before
[1:50:08] anyone. I was at my lowest point
[1:50:14] spiritually so deep down there. And then
[1:50:17] uh I I I used to come and sometimes
[1:50:21] pastor would
[1:50:23] preach and I think something in me woke
[1:50:28] up and back then I thought it was I used
[1:50:33] to just wonder what is
[1:50:36] this and then and then uh I remember I
[1:50:40] used to go back
[1:50:42] home and then something just makes me
[1:50:45] text pastor.
[1:50:47] And I tell him, I want to see you
[1:50:49] tomorrow. I see you
[1:50:51] tomorrow. He's like, "Come." So I come,
[1:50:55] I sit in used I sit in his
[1:50:58] car and then he asked me Polap. He
[1:51:02] wanted to meet
[1:51:04] me, talk to me. So then I'll just sit
[1:51:09] there and I tell him I also don't know
[1:51:15] what. So we used to talk other
[1:51:18] things and then I go back home. And then
[1:51:22] next time I text him, pastor, I want to
[1:51:23] come. I want to
[1:51:25] come. So then I come again. I sit with
[1:51:29] him and there's
[1:51:31] nothing. It bothered
[1:51:33] me. I think he also got bothered.
[1:51:37] But one thing I really
[1:51:39] like, God gave us a very patient
[1:51:43] path. So I went back home and I think it
[1:51:46] was either the third or fourth
[1:51:48] time. So I came back and I sat with him.
[1:51:53] I told him,
[1:51:54] "Poly, you've been here for two or three
[1:51:57] times. What do you have to say? What do
[1:52:01] you want to tell me?" And then I I just
[1:52:03] kept quiet.
[1:52:06] And at that point I was actually my
[1:52:09] heart was
[1:52:11] taken. I was so pulled that he didn't
[1:52:14] have to say any word to me for me to say
[1:52:16] to see the the the faults in my
[1:52:23] life. So then this time he started
[1:52:25] asking
[1:52:26] me okay I'm going to ask
[1:52:29] you did you do
[1:52:31] this? No. Have you done this? No. Did
[1:52:37] you do this?
[1:52:39] No.
[1:52:41] And I was also I don't know what was up
[1:52:44] with me that
[1:52:46] time. And then I just burst into
[1:52:49] tears. And then I told him, "Pastor, I
[1:52:51] don't know why I'm
[1:52:53] here, but whenever at home I don't have
[1:52:56] peace. Something just tells me to come
[1:52:59] here to come and meet you."
[1:53:02] And that's how it was. Something in my
[1:53:05] heart persuaded me. I didn't know what
[1:53:08] it was. I didn't know what I
[1:53:10] wanted. He just took me
[1:53:13] there. And and just like that,
[1:53:17] uh I believe pastor being a man of God,
[1:53:19] God directed him on how to deal with
[1:53:25] me. So from completely knowing, not
[1:53:28] knowing what is wrong,
[1:53:32] Now I can stand before you
[1:53:34] today. I can just say it's the grace of
[1:53:38] God. You don't have to fight your way
[1:53:41] there. Just stay under the
[1:53:44] word. I can say that the word has
[1:53:49] power. To do
[1:53:52] anything if you believe the
[1:53:54] word you can say
[1:53:56] anything and it will be that.
[1:54:00] Don't
[1:54:01] doubt. Don't doubt the God you have
[1:54:04] believed. Many times uh uh uh God has
[1:54:08] performed signs and wonders to prove
[1:54:10] this
[1:54:13] message. You don't have to be on
[1:54:16] the on the background watching for is
[1:54:18] there anything wrong with the
[1:54:22] message looking for looking for faults
[1:54:24] in the
[1:54:26] message. That is not your place.
[1:54:29] Just believe the
[1:54:31] word. You'll find yourself where you
[1:54:33] have never
[1:54:38] been. God bless
[1:54:42] you. Uh let's sing this song as we
[1:54:45] invite brother Martin.
[1:54:50] But I
[1:54:52] know I
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:56] have and I'm
[1:55:00] persuaded that he's
[1:55:05] able to keep
[1:55:09] the which I've
[1:55:14] committed and to him
[1:55:18] against the dead.
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:24] But I
[1:55:26] know I have

[1:55:44] that which have
[1:55:49] me and to

[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:42] speak

[1:59:49] Speak my

[1:59:56] Jesus and I will
[2:00:00] quick to
[2:00:02] answer thee.
[2:00:10] Take
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:15] my speak.
[2:00:19] My
[2:00:23] Lord speak.
[2:00:28] [Music]
[2:00:35] Why don't you just go before the Lord
[2:00:38] and pour your heart before him
[2:00:42] for he is
[2:00:44] here. He has spoken to
[2:00:48] us and I trust that was the masterpiece.
[2:00:55] It was not brother Paul is speaking but
[2:00:56] the Holy Spirit speaking to
[2:01:00] us. Just surrender yourself to the
[2:01:04] Lord. Are you persuaded by the word or
[2:01:09] you've just been
[2:01:11] coming? But brother, we ought to be
[2:01:14] persuaded by the
[2:01:16] word. We have to be
[2:01:20] convinced. And the only we can be
[2:01:22] concerned after being
[2:01:25] convinced is when we are
[2:01:29] persuaded, fully persuaded like the
[2:01:32] saints of
[2:01:34] all. For the Bible says that our
[2:01:38] fathers, they lived in sheep's skin.
[2:01:42] They rested in
[2:01:45] tents. They put on those sheepkin
[2:01:47] brother
[2:01:49] sister. But they were
[2:01:52] persuaded by that city whose
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:01:56] builder and maker is God in
[2:01:59] soul. And a brother told
[2:02:02] us some even died without seeing that
[2:02:06] city. But by faith they were persuaded.
[2:02:13] Hallelujah Lord
[2:02:15] Jesus. Father, we surrender our hearts
[2:02:18] to you this
[2:02:19] evening. We thank you for the word you
[2:02:22] have sent us this
[2:02:24] day. Father, we pray that may the great
[2:02:26] Holy
[2:02:28] Spirit may come and compel us
[2:02:32] tonight and persuade us, Lord
[2:02:35] Jesus, that this is true, Lord
[2:02:38] Jesus, like the disciples were
[2:02:42] persuaded. And they said that this very
[2:02:46] word, the word which was
[2:02:49] spoken, the word which was in the
[2:02:52] beginning, we ate with
[2:02:55] him, we walked with
[2:02:58] it, we touched him because they were
[2:03:03] persuaded by that word, Lord. Heaven
[2:03:07] Father, thanks what we need,
[2:03:09] Lord. We are living in the time, Lord
[2:03:11] Jesus.
[2:03:13] in the ends of the end
[2:03:15] time and we are seeing many are leaving
[2:03:18] Lord. Many are forsaking the way it's
[2:03:22] because they have never been persuaded
[2:03:25] Lord. But father we thank you but that
[2:03:29] you have brought us this long way
[2:03:32] because we are persuaded Lord. Lord, we
[2:03:35] know whom we
[2:03:36] believe. And we pray that even for those
[2:03:39] who are still struggling, Lord, that
[2:03:42] they will be confused tonight. They
[2:03:45] persuaded by the Holy
[2:03:47] Ghost. Oh, Father, we thank
[2:03:50] you. Hope I believe to believe the
[2:03:54] word. Father, we bless you and your
[2:03:57] name. We love you, Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:04:01] Father, we need more of
[2:04:03] you. More of your grace,
[2:04:06] Lord, more of your
[2:04:09] anointing, more of your
[2:04:11] blessings and more of your
[2:04:14] revelation is because they had the
[2:04:16] revelation of the
[2:04:18] word. That's why AB gave more extra
[2:04:23] sacrifice. Precious father, Lord
[2:04:26] Jesus, we know that you may not be
[2:04:28] feeling it, Lord.
[2:04:30] But the Holy Spirit in the minister
[2:04:33] saying that we just have to believe it
[2:04:35] anyhow
[2:04:36] Lord must believe it Lord Jesus because
[2:04:40] nobody comes and you chase him out
[2:04:43] Lord restore the comes to be father to
[2:04:47] you. Must believe that you are and you
[2:04:51] are reward of those who seeketh you
[2:04:54] tell must be persuaded that you are.
[2:05:01] For you are the high priest touched by
[2:05:02] the feeling of
[2:05:05] father. May you touch our hearts
[2:05:09] tonight. May you confess those who are
[2:05:12] father who are doubting
[2:05:15] Lord. Father may you touch each and
[2:05:17] every soul
[2:05:18] tonight. Even those have been streaming
[2:05:21] this service. Lord, may they be
[2:05:24] persuaded by the word. Father we thank
[2:05:27] you.
[2:05:29] We bless you at your name.
[2:05:31] We give you praise now.
[2:05:34] The most precious name.
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:06:06] Precious kind and heaven father,
[2:06:10] we humble ourselves in your presence.
[2:06:15] We have come with our sacrifice
[2:06:17] [Music]
[2:06:18] tonight and we believe that you have
[2:06:21] consumed our
[2:06:26] sacrifice of each and every
[2:06:30] worshipper. May the word which you have
[2:06:32] heard this
[2:06:35] day, may it get rooted deeper in our
[2:06:38] heart.
[2:06:41] May you help us be the doers of the
[2:06:45] word, not only the hearers of the
[2:06:49] word. For the Bible says that because of
[2:06:51] their
[2:06:54] unbelief, that's why they perish in the
[2:06:58] wilderness. Precious
[2:07:00] father, you have used our brother this

[2:09:37] Lord, we pray that you use each one of
[2:09:40] us in a mighty way.

[2:10:07] rightful
[2:10:08] position even as we're leaving this
[2:10:10] place, Jehovah
[2:10:12] God. Remember our
[2:10:15] pastor, Lord Jesus, who is on his
[2:10:19] way for the missionary
[2:10:22] trip. We ask that you bless him where he
[2:10:24] has
[2:10:25] gone. May the great Holy Spirit use him
[2:10:28] in a mighty
[2:10:30] way. Lord, he will come back with a
[2:10:34] testimony and we shall be careful to
[2:10:36] give you the glory and
[2:10:39] praise. Take him out of the way whenever
[2:10:41] he will
[2:10:43] stand that Lord you will use him in a
[2:10:46] mighty
[2:10:47] way. Prepare the hearts of the bright
[2:10:50] side Lord.
[2:10:53] that they will receive the
[2:10:55] word. Father, Lord
[2:10:57] Jesus, we pray for his
[2:11:00] family and his dear wife
[2:11:03] Jehovah that you you'll protect
[2:11:06] them. You'll be the head of his family.

[2:11:28] Lord. I dismiss your people with your
[2:11:31] blessings that will keep us under the
[2:11:34] blood until we meet here on Sunday

[2:12:04] life. May you touch her from the crown
[2:12:08] of her head, the soul of her
[2:12:11] feet. Even those who have not
