Above all, above all, above [Music] all, the world has ever known. [Music] above [Music] all the ways of mine. You are here [Music] before. You were [Music] crucified, laid behind the storm. You live to die. Rejected and alone like a rose trumpet on the ground. You took a thought and thought of me above. You are crucified. Laid behind the storm. You live to die. Rejected and alone like a [Music] role on the ground. You two were [Music] thrown and thought of me. Above all, above all prayers, above all things, above all wonderers and unknown above Build the treasures of the earth. There's no one to measure what you are. You are crucified.

Lord Father, we want to thank you Lord Father. Loving Father, you left for us a debt loving heavenly master. Lord Father, a debt which you didn't owe. Lord Father, you paid a debt. Lord Father, a debt for people who you didn't know. Heavenly King of Kings, Lord Father. Lord Father, we were nothing. Lord Father, but you made us something. Heavenly King of kings, Lord Father, loving Father, you were wounded, Lord Father, for our iniquities, Lord Father, bitter, Lord Father, for our transgressions, heavenly father, but you were innocent, heavenly father, you had no blemish, Lord Father, loving Father, who are we, Lord Father, to be standing before you, Lord Father, this evening, Lord Father, master, Lord Father, all we can do is to give in our lives, Lord Father, to you, Lord Father. Lord Father, there is nothing that can amount Lord Father to pay that debt. Lord Father, loving Father, no one on this world, Lord Father, can ever do that for a friend, Lord Father. But you, Lord, you came down, Lord Father, to prove your love to us, loving, heavenly master, Lord, loving Father, we are grateful, Lord Father, we are grateful, Lord Father, for your hand, loving master, Lord Father, we are grateful, Lord Father, Lord Father, there is none like you, Lord Father. Lord, we've searched all over, Lord Father. But Lord Father, there is no one, Lord Father, with such a love, Lord Father, loving Master, we come before you, Lord, Father, for we know that you are with us, Lord, this evening, Lord, Father, for you promise, Lord Father, that you bring us a comforter, Lord Father, you will not leave us, Lord Father, as Lord. Lord, Father, we here, Lord, asking for your grace, Lord Father. May Lord Father, forgive us, Lord, of our shortcomings. Heavenly Master, Lord Father. Lord Father, because we are humans, Lord Father, we easily forget, Lord Father, we easily go short of your word. Lord Father, in our thoughts, Lord Father, in our actions, Lord Father, in our words, heavenly master, Lord Father, my loving father, this is our plea this evening, Lord Father. Lord Father, may you have mercy upon our wicked souls, Lord Father, may you melt these hearts of stone. Lord Father, may you, Lord Father, give us a heart of flesh, Lord Father, that can receive your word, Lord Father, loving Father, we pray, Lord Father, that you may start up a fire once again within us, Lord Father, loving Father, create a clean heart, Lord Father, and restore other in spirit, Lord Father, within our lives, heavenly father, Lord. Loving Father, many of us have gone short of your word, Lord Father. Lord Father, some of us are shaming. Lord Father, most of the people Lord Father gone denying your power. Lord Father, my king of kings, Lord Father, we are humbly apologizing, Lord Father. We are asking for your mercy. Lord Father, begging for your grace. Lord Father, Lord Father, we may come and take full eminence in our lives. Lord Father, may we, Lord, stand with your word, Lord Father. May we not take sides with any other thing, Lord Father. Help us not to compromise with your word, Lord Father. Lord Father may you teach us Lord Father to be doers of your word Lord Father this evening heaven king of kings Lord Father loving master perhaps that's why many of us are sick this evening Lord Father perhaps that's why Lord Father many have fallen heavenly father but loving father we have come to realize Lord Father that you're too faithful Lord Father to us heavenly master Lord Father you always stand with your word heavenly father Lord Father we ask you Lord that Lord father may you restore us Lord Father back to the faith of our fathers. Heavenly Father, loving father, we want to thank you, Lord Father, for the food that you've been feeding to us, Lord Father. We want to thank you, Lord, for you've kept us, heavenly father, under your word, Lord Father, under the truth of this age, Lord Father, whereas many people, Lord Father, drifting away, Lord Father, Lord, you've thrown down a lifeline, Lord Father, to save our souls, Lord Father.

Heavenly Father, my loving heavenly master, we pray Lord Father, may you, Lord, prepare us, heavenly father, for your coming, heavenly father, because it is now.

Heavenly Father, loving father, may you come, Lord Father, if it needs to be disciplined. Lord Father, discipline us, Lord Father, to get back to the track. Heavenly Father, the Lord Father, we may do our purpose, Lord Father, rightfully on earth. Heavenly Father, loving Father, we pray Lord Father that you may also come Lord Father provide the necessities Lord Father that you be needed Lord Father in furthering the gospel Lord Father to your children heavenly father because Lord Father we know Lord Father even back in those days Lord Father you needed the material things Lord Father to be used to father the gospel heavenly father loving Father we pray Lord Father come and provide to us heavenly father come Lord Father and heal the sick Lord Father come Lord Father perform the same miracles.

Oh dear, loving our king of glory. Thank you Lord for your mercies and grace. [Music] Oh Lord father for we are incomplete without you. We welcome you in our midst. Lord, father of Christ, may you forgive us. And Lord, may you make us worthy to be in your presence. And Lord Kim, father, may you come and divide this thought in our [Music] midst that you've given me to share with your children. Lord, get me out of the way completely. It's all to do with your with your bride and you Lord Lord Father I pray for each one of us to be blessed and also we remember our pastor may bless him wherever he is Lord in the precious name of Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. I think as we are still standing let's open the Bible the book of revelation chapter 4 verse one he say that after this I looked And behold, a door was opened in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up hither, and I will shoot thee things which must be hereafter." Revelation 4, sorry, verse one. Revelations 4 verse one. [Music] Verse one. Yes. Verse one. Verse one. May be seated. to the [Music] court. Praise the Lord, saints. I'm happy again to be here once again. It is always the grace of God to serve him. And I thank pastor for giving me this opportunity. It is rare. It's not easy for pastor to trust you in his absence. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And of course we are going to have him this coming Sunday. Hope you're all waiting to hear what he has. Hallelujah. Amen. So last time I realized I spoke a lot of things and I didn't bring them to a conclusion. Hallelujah. But today I will try my level best to keep time and still I'm sure I will not finish. So still I'm speaking on part two of come up hither and for a tit I will take the judgment seal if you remember very well we talked about that seal that's the sixth seal hallelujah so here the Bible says You know, last time we say that just maybe for a recap, [Music] the prophet usually could type this chapter and then he says that in Revelation chapter 4, it is the going of the church that the church goes up. But you see, we need to understand these things. We need really to understand and if you pray for me I believe God maybe reveal something small for you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So there are these you know the prophet preached revelation the book of symbols. Hallelujah. So there are some things here that where we need sorry let us remove where we need a higher revelation to understand them. And of course we know very well that before 1963 the prophet also could preach things that are not uh to that revelation. with the Pentecostal background some of the things you could come late and correct himself. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Uh there is a picture brother Marvin I forgot to send it to you if you can download it. It shows people going to the rapture. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see that is Pentecost Pentecostal [Music] perspection. But now we see that after the opening of the seals, there was a higher revelation. So we see there are some things that I want us to get out the the way in this verse. Uh there when when you say that the church goes up, come up hither, what does it mean? Does it really mean fly in the clouds? No sir. What does it mean? Okay, we shall come to that. Now remember that John saw he had a voice like of a trumpet and then the prophet says that he didn't hear the trumpet but he had the voice like of a trumpet bro if you could help on sound. So we can read in in the exposition of the church age the patimos vision say that John did not say it was a trumpet. It was like a trumpet. Now when a trumpet is blown it's a it has an agency about it. Israel was always assembled by the sounding of a trumpet. Something important is at hand. Then he say that, "Oh, that we might hear the voice of God as a trumpet this day. For it is the gospel trumpet, sounding forth the word of the of prophecy to make us aware of and prepared for what is coming. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This voice that is like a trumpet. Of course, why he said it's not a trumpet but voice like a trumpet. We know that trumpets are for the Jews. And then the seals are for the bride. And then the seven vials they are for the world, the unbelievers. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So whenever the preacher stands here to preach, it's an urgency. It's an urgency. [Music] needs you to to act immediately. When you go to the message of s is it the end time the prophet preaches and repeatedly he keeps saying that something is fixing to when he's preaching the seals he's always saying Now you understand it. Now I think you get it. I hope you have not missed it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it is an [Music] urgency. It is a voice like a trumpet. And that is for every preacher that [Music] stands. the five-fold ministry to the bride. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, and and we see that this is Naomi when we go in the in the book of Ruth, we see this trumpet who was typing the old [Music] church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. and the fivefold ministry if I'm uh she was sounding to Ruth giving her the words of wisdom and it was an urgency come up he hither Ruth rest at Bo's feet hallelujah And now remember that Ruth when he had this sounding trumpet gospel trumpet of the five-fold ministry she had to act to act immediately. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Receive her kinsman redeemer. So saints preachers come stand here on the pit. Please act immediately. Whatever they they are talking about take note of [Music] it because by all means you have to act or you don't act. And now why have I brought this Ruth and Naomi? Remember at that point O was not there. Where was she? And yet they were together. They were together. Remember O and Ruth? of the same tribe of the same tribe married to both the sons of God. But where where was she at this moment? She was behind incia. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why? Because there had to be a time of decision. And now I think you're getting the reason why I read for you last time. Revelation chapter 17 verse 14. Do you think we should repeat it? Let's repeat it to get it better. Something is going on. Saints the man. So here it says that 17 15 oh 14. Yeah. Uh this shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings. And they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful. and called. It is by predestination. They are chosen by election and faithful by their decision. you know, they have to make a choice. Ruth decided to go to stay with Naomi and was giving her the words of wisdom. And that was the gospel trumpet that was leading her to the feet of Boaz. And of course, you know, it ended up when she was redeemed. The full redemption. Hallelujah. I I think now you can connect the reason I read that uh brother Joel preached on Friday if I'm to remember Friday about Jacob's uh is it walk Jacob's walk? And then he say that there are three people involved. Jacob had to play a part. The mother had to play a part also. And who else was play a part? God himself. Now what God did, God elected. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And what did he do? What was his part? It was to be faithful to the election that make a decision and then through his mother, God predestinated it that the mother will give her wisdom. It will be that way. So it is with the church of Christ there is a part for the bright play and that's the the part of making a decision already God already elected you already. He chose you by election and then he predestinated he predestinated your work of course through the five-fold ministry. God was merciful to us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So whenever the preacher stands here always take everything. Okay. I know sometimes the preacher can speak piercing words directly. But friends, it is because of something that is coming. [Music] Just don't uh you know don't shake your fist against the preacher like how Kane did. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So remember the prophet says why am I connecting this to the judgment seal? Remember I told you that the bride is beaten out of Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now remember the prophet says that whenever we come to church every Sunday is a judgment judgment seat of God. Every Sunday it's judgment. That's what the prophet say. So if a preacher preaches a very good sermon, a lovely sermon, nice to hear, that Sunday you are lucky because it is a judgment seat every Sunday because I've heard some people maybe a preacher comes here and preach of course you know when the preachers are preaching they are also careful not call out your name. But even if it happens, friends, just break. Take it. Just take it. Take it. Because now we are going to see here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we go back to our scripture. Come up [Music] hither. Come up. What was it meaning? You see Jesus said in I think in Luke 21 when you see these things they have come to pass. Lift up your hands and look up for your redemption draws near. Wait a minute. What was he meaning? Was he meaning that you look up in the skies? Not really. Now you're going to see the reason why when the prophet was preaching about the rapture. He went to Psalms 27. Not second Corinthians, [Music] not not 2 Corinthians 15, neither 2 Corinthians chapter 4. Hallelujah. Of course, we know all this was after the opening of the seals. I'm saying that this was after the opening of the seals when this revelation was delivered. Not the Pentecostal view. Hallelujah. Come up. What does he mean? And also we see Stefan when he was beaten and stoned. The Bible says, I think in the book of Acts chapter 7, he looked up steadily steadfastly into heavens and saw the glory of God. Did he look like this and saw uh the heaven open? Not really. So what does he mean? The prophet say that it means higher dimension and now higher dimension he does not mean like a story building you know there's how Pentecostals draw the dimension the first dimension down the second dimension the fifth no it's not that it is higher in terms of access but everything is here. All the dimensions are here connected to you right now. I will give you an example the dimension of hell. It is right here. You remember in the third seal when that pale horse rider was riding, the Bible says that hell followed him. Hell followed him. So, okay, that's not what I'm talking about. But if if God allows another time, we shall talk about it. But anyway, the dimensions they are with us. It is all about the access [Music] between. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now we see even Jesus himself. I will give you an example for the scripture but it says no one has ascended to heaven except the son who came down from heaven and then he said who is in heaven the son of man. Hallelujah. What was he meaning? He was meaning that dimension he was accessing it. Hallelujah. So what does the what what does the Bible mean that you should come up here? It's all to do with the dimensions. It is to do with the dimensions bro. Did you get the picture? Of course, you know these photos have I think you have ever seen them. People are going naked women with trousers and mini skirts. Oh, what a deception. What a deception. The prophet say that it will be in a twink of an eye just switching between the dimensions and then he say that this world you see it is in three 3D dimensions for you to live you see and that's light matter and time without any of Because you cannot exist everything will freeze. So you see that even human beings they also in three soul spirit and without the body you're not a living soul. Without a soul you are dead body. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So and also maybe I I will Since I'm not talking about that today, you can I didn't even put it in my notes here, but I don't know why I was going that direction, but you can read the messages uh present stage of my ministry countdown influence on 1963 August and others as well. The prophet talks about those dimensions. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see that Jesus was living in flesh but at the same time he's in another dimension. And the prophet in the message it's the raising of the sun. He says that he was the wave sheep offering. It was there the first fruit the offering typing of uh you know the meaning of the first fruit in the old testament it means it is taping of the remaining uh the remaining seeds. that they are also coming to that level of maturity. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the prophet says that he was he was waved. Hallelujah. On the cross. But again he was waved again uh in re in 1963. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that brings us to the bread edge. Hallelujah. It brings us to the harvest time. And now it means that we also we ought to come to that level of maturity to the full adoption of the sons of God. Friends, let's stop these things of joking of Lakia. While the preacher comes here and preaches and you leave when you are sad in your heart just let it go. Hallelujah. And now here we see that coming up hither friends it is to do with the dimensions and it's very possible because Jesus Christ son of man being re he was uh being revealed through brotherham and he was giving us an example of the level of maturity should come to now. It didn't only stop with brother Brandon. But it was waved. The pillow of fire was waved over the people. Hallelujah. Why? Because the rising of the sun. Why? It is the rising of the sun. You know, it's the raising of the sun. The prophet say that uh in the message I believe Christ the mystery of God revealed. He says that the son rose from the dead the s from the dead and it was lighting. There was light in the beginning in the beginning of the church. But then afterwards we see that men's idea pad up piled up and piled up and left the sand behind. And now because of of the accumulations of those piles [Music] It produced the church ages because the church ages, you see, when Paul was writing, when James was writing, if you read their writings, do does it seem like they are writing church ages? They were writing like as if time is now. Time is normal. So churches were not in their minds because the sun had already risen. It was light. But now Jehovah already predestinated and he saw it would be that way. And through through Ezekiel He prophesied and said, "There shall be light in the evening. The son that was left behind again, he will be revealed and appear in the end time and we are living in that very time. It's the time of the resurrection. It's the Easter time. Hallelujah. My my my. So we see that it is the it's to do with dimensions. You remember brother Bos when he died and the prophet says that this brother he died and he was in the room. First of all he called his family and he said bye to them by and he was busy greeting the unseen. the beloved that died. But yet this brother was still in his body. But he was switching. Hallelujah. With inside of it was calling it was switching into that dimension, the sixth dimension. Hallelujah. And then he went and then there's also another brother who died. And then this one, the prophet saw a vision. He saw him when his body is there. But this brother was busy greeting people there. He was crossing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see brother Martin on Sunday preached and he said there is something that he talked about was it Sunday or he was giving remarks on Friday and he said a brother you are just there local you can't even think what if I'm moving on the way and then I'm knocked I You are just waiting for that very moment. Remember time is filled with swift transition. In a twink of an eye, you find yourself when you are switched into the other dimension. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now friends, there's a scripture that Jesus talked about. The prophet was not understanding this scripture. I'm not correcting him. He corrected himself. Through his correction, we also got the revelation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Um I didn't write it here. But it says that if your hand offends the offended, cut it off something like that. You remember for it is better to enter in life when you are named than going to hell with two two hands. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then he said that I think let me find it here. Let me find just a moment. Just a moment. Just a moment. A moment a moment says that where they warm warm dieth [Music] not and the fire is not quenched. Hallelujah. Does it mean that in hell there are wombs? Does it mean that there is a burning fire? Of course, when you read it that you can get some imaginations, but that's not what it was mean. The worm dieth not. The worm dieth not. It refers to the to your conscience or guilty that torments you in hell. eating you up eternally. The time tested memorials. You see, whenever preacher stands here and preaches, any word of God that you hear and you don't act, it is those very words that are going to torment [Music] you. What's the worst? That's your soul. That's your soul. It will be not even God tormenting you. It will be you yourself. You're conscious. You're guilty. Tormenting you seriously. And now this fire that never quenched, it's not the fire like how you think. But let me leave that. Hallelujah for another time. Now we see that the prophet say that the only solution to our condition in it is revelation chapter 4 to be caught up into a certain dimension. Hallelujah. Amen. Into a certain [Music] dimension. And by by God's predestination, he gave us the preachers. He gave us he said for us the prophet. The pastor is always preaching here. What have you done? What have you done, saints? What have we done? You see, so we have always to ask ourselves and always we we try our our level best to do something. And now we see here there are two reasons you may not come up into that dimension. Reason one, either you haven't heard the the gospel trumpet. Of course, you're not here. Those are unbelievers. Reason two, you are still behind the walls of the walls of Jericho. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see, when you go in the book of Joshua, The priests, they had to blow the trumpets. They had to draw to blow the trumpet. No, no, no. They had to blow the trumpets that day. I'm talking about a specific [Music] time. Not really. Okay, you'll get it. Let me first say these priests they had to blow the trumpets and then the people also were they had to respond that those trumpets for for the walls to [Music] fall. Exactly. God bless you. Amen. So we see that it was the duty of the priest to blow the trumpets and the trumpets were calling for urgency. And then these people they also had a part to play because remember the trumpets were not bring down the walls. It is the bride. The bride has a ministry in this time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. She has to bring down those walls. Hallelujah. And now uh these priests they they blew the trumpets and whenever in Israel whenever the trumpets are blown you have to act immediately. immediately. Even if you are lame, no excuse if you don't act what there are consequences also. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we see now to this age that we are living in the consequences of not responding urgently. You find yourself that you are in a point of no [Music] return, no mercy for you because the prophet says that keeps spanning the mercy of God, but you will do that for the last time. and you realize that even though you repent, you cannot come back. I'm talking about the judgment seal. So you bear me, you bear with me. Hallelujah. So we need we ought to act urgently. And and if you don't act, you find out that you will be in bondage in bondages forever. Behind the walls. Let's let's first look a little bit about these walls. Uh we have very many walls in LA. We have the lukewarm wall. [Music] not hot enough to leave the message and not cold enough to reject it to you are just there. The pastor calls you, "Brother, how are you?" We are there. There you didn't come to church. Ah, let me tell you, brothers, this is so real. Uh, okay. I'm I'm sorry. There's a brother I talked to before I came here on the pull pit. Maybe he will hear this. You forgive me. I didn't mean to bring I didn't mean really. Uh but you see I you know when I was praying before I came I cried and I said God may help us. Because in most cases you find ourselves we are entangled. in the cares of this world. And then it is the cares of this world that makes us put God number two. And we find ourselves God is not in the first place in our hearts. You see how can you miss church because you're worrying because you're looking for this and this. You don't have rent. Everyone has those problems, but we just switch them off and then we activate the other dimension. Hallelujah. And that is what we ought to do. That's what we ought to do. And you see this lukewarm wall. May God help us because that now concerns all of us. May God help us brethren be able to overcome because it is not easy to tell because remember these are not being lukewarm. You are not busy with sin but you're a good person only that you are busy with the cares of the last time now I read for you scripture which says to be minded is it is death but now remember to be minded is not to be sinful Just these natural things take you out and you find yourself you are replacing God from uh that position. You put him in [Music] another. And what is the solution? It is repent. As simple as that. Let me tell you friends, you are still missing church because of the cares of the world. The time is going to come when this sixth seal. It is in its full engage fully engaged and you are always at church from Monday to [Music] Monday. Maybe even call pastor. Hey pastor, do we have a service on Tuesday? Can we have overnight on Monday? Friends, that time is soon coming. And time is filled with swift transition. Within a twink of an eye, you'll find yourself caught into that time. And and in that time, you're not even seeing how busy you are. We have the walls [Music] of no still the same walls. The wall I will not finish them all but I'll talk about the zeal for God. The lost zeal. You see today I was I appreciate those brothers who came early and started praying. They created an atmosphere here. I felt it when I was entering the church. I felt ashamed because I came just to realize there's a certain atmosphere. You see because the brothers they already praying. I wish we can keep it that way. I wish we can be doing that. You find you come from home 2 minutes to the service. Why zeal lost? If God gives us grace again and go God gives me another chance, I will talk about that. in a depth. The harvest time show you that the harvest time it means the original seed that was planted it is now [Music] displayed. That is when you you know that's the harvest. The disciples they were praying every day moving from home to home. What we are doing is close to that home sales. But may God give us grace. We make it more than that because I believe we are growing until we go back fully until the very seed that was sown. It's manifested. And why were they doing those things? Because they had a zeal for God. They had zeal. You hear a brother is going to stand here to preach. You pray for him. You can't wait to hear what God is going to speak to you. What do you have in store for me? Hallelujah. May God give us that very now I see I will not even finish. So if God gives me time and allows we shall continue with this judgment seal just these 10 minutes remaining. Let's talk about it. What's this judgment seal? This the sixth seal. And what's the sixth seal? It is after the bride. That's true. But also that is the time when it will be in its full power. Hallelujah. Now we see that uh uh the sixth the prophet says in the the sec about the second world war that it was the tender hand of Jehovah driving the Jews back to their homeland. [Music] And remember Israel and the church. If this tender hand of Jehovah under the influence of the sixth seal, the judgment seal, the tribulation, if it was driving the Jews back to their homeland, there is something that is doing to our souls. And then I'll read this say that Okay, I didn't put it all here, but says in the third exodus say that how sometimes it looks real of the way that people suffer, but it still it's the tender hand of Jehovah leading his little children. We thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But up in that [Music] message that God had to harden the heart of Hitler to be rough, the children of Israel. Was it a good thing? It's not a good thing. It's not a good experience. But yet, it was a tender hand of Jehovah had mercy on them to drive them to their homeland to to eat on the tree of life. So there is something it is playing in our soul. The prophet says that there is tribulation in your soul. There is always [Music] tribulation. And now uh I can read for you this scripture. I'm sorry I'm using the phone so it is disturbing me here. Okay, it's fine. But you know the scripture, the Bible where says that talks about persecution and tribulation how it is part of salvation. Hallelujah. So God use it is always the tender hand of Jehovah. When you get problems, there's tribulation in your souls. But now I want you I'm soon closing. I want you closing towards these two kinds of people. Everyone under the influence of that seal. [Music] Everyone is the seal of [Music] judgment. And when the judgment comes, how do you respond? We see this judgment, the sixth seal. Cain came under the influence of this sixth seal one [Music] time. And how did he respond? How did he react? He said, "Oh, this is too much than I can bear." And now remember the prophet says that this seal seal reveals the seventh. It leads us to the seventh meaning that the dimensions come together. So it means that the ministry of the bride. It is to bring the sixth and the seventh together. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Okay, let me read for you this quote. I've remembered their quote the seven seals and the the seventh seal said but it will be revealed in that day in the hour that is supposed to be revealed. Now we all know that the seventh seal was not revealed. If we are to say, but was it not revealed? The prophet say that it's not for the public. Hallelujah. It is for who? It's for the bride, for an individual. Hallelujah. It's for an individual. And then he say that we find that the sixth seal has been open to us. We see it and we know that this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public. But again say until the hour arrives until the day. Which day is that? Write it down. I'm not going to read it. That's John 14:20. Why in that day you will know that I am in you and you in me. Friends, that's the seventh seal. There lies your seventh seal. It's the seventh seal where the bride is married together with the [Music] husband. Where heavens embraces the earth. [Music] Meaning that the one, two, three dimensions one, two, three, six married with the seven. It is all about the switching of dimensions. Hallelujah. And now we see that we all ought to come under the influence of the sixth seed. There are many things there under that se but I will not go through them. Unless God gives time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But we see that when it comes we see that Isaiah also came under the influence of the six. How did he respond? He broke down and says, "Wo is me." And then we see also this woman at the well. Actually, this story is interesting because it is in it's the bride story. The prophet says it's in the fourth gospel. [Music] You remember the ego from our previous the ego John? Okay in the fourth chapter of John sixth how of the day and then here comes the the son of man. And what did he do the son of man? He started revealing the seals to her. One, two, three, four, five, six men. And when she saw uh when she saw the sixth six revealed to her the seventh because now remember the prophet said that the seventh he is always the one revealing he's the one revealing God created in six days where is the seven creator hallelujah praise the Lord and now we also see back to our story of Ruth and Opa. Ruth, we see 666. And then we see that he uh this Boaz he gave her six measures of [Music] B. He gave her the seventh The seventh is always [Music] hidden and the seventh is to do with marriage is to do with Adam and Eve. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that's you understand what the Bible says that if even if we suffer all these sufferings are not compared. When we are fully combined with the seven, when we are back beyond the curtain of time and when we are switch the dimension, we cannot remember. But remember, it's needed is needed. That's why the Bible says that the children of God, they don't worry. Worrying it is a spirit. It's the devil and the devil means lying. By the word devil means lies. He is always lying to us. You get? So these sufferings we need them friends. But when we get them because now the Bible gave us a warning and gave us the solution to this. Oh, let's read the book of James. Let me read this one. James chapter 5. When you're under the influence of this judgment, the judgment of God, Here he says that 58 from 8 say that be also patient uh establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord is draweth nigh. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned. Behold, the judge standeth before the door. Now, this was the warning. I'll read for you the solution later on. Now what was he meaning by grudge not? Because God remember God to bring you under the influence of the six judge seal. Sometimes he can use your brethren. We are brothers because we are humans. Now for example, maybe you engaged to the sister and the sister is engaged to you or maybe you are doing with a certain brother or some other person business or of the sort as you know death and then maybe things happen. this brother hurts you. Remember God uses these testing moments. Remember I told you last time that there these four living creatures guarding the throne of God. You don't just go enter in there. You have to be tested first and hallelujah. And then God watches you. Hallelujah. I've given you just an example. There are many many things. But first of all, we should not be worried worried about rent, worried about what to eat, worried about the cares of this world. never and there is a secret I'm giving that but there is nothing comes to the believer without going through the secret desk of Jehovah for signature for him to sign everything he's aware of them now after knowing that it means no worry. No worry because worrying is a devil. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The sister breaks your heart. God watches how are you going to you are under that influence. How are you responding? The sister breaks your heart because she's a human being. The brother breaks your heart. But brother, we already went for introduction. Friends, there is nothing happens without going through the desk, secret desk of Jehovah. Everything is in control. Hallelujah. Everything is in control. And now remember God uses these tribulations to drive you to your homeland. Hallelujah to position you. And now the prophet say that the sixth seal is the burning down of the earth. And now if it's the burning down of the earth then it means is the burning down of our bodies. It's burning down of ourselves. It's burning down. And it is the tender hand of Jehovah of Jehovah that has given you these trials to judge you and to see whether you stand the test of time. Are you worthy for the tabernacle of God? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And whenever we receive these tribulations, uh James told us, be patient. Number one, establish your hearts. Grudge not. Don't keep someone in your heart because someone hurt you. It was the tender hand of [Applause] Jehovah to test you and to see whether you are worthy to stand the test of time. You remember the book of Joel said uh he said that I send my armies but God called them my armies. What was [Music] that? To do what? To eat up the church. the church of Christ, but it's God's army such that he can rebuild it, he can position it again in the full stature of who Jesus is. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see that those were the armies of [Music] God. But again, we ought to bring it to an individual There is something going on. There is revelation that we are receiving. And every day in our life, we receive this new revelation. I mean we grow. Are you growing? And friends if you feel I will give you an idea. If you feel maybe you are being caught up in some kind of sort of loudian behind the walls of [Music] Jericho, don't be left behind. Don't allow that. Do whatever it needs. At least run to the pastor. Explain him your conditions you're going through. M I know if something is not right you [Music] know if something is not right you know maybe something that you have failed overcome God has given you your pastor and he can help you he said that he will take you through all this I'm trying to show you that the bride has a part to You've got to make a decision. You've got to be faithful for you that day to stand with the lamb. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I had a lot to say. I didn't know. May God bless you. [Applause] Lord, lift me up and let me stand. Brother Martin, by faith on heaven and stable love higher plane than I have. So plant my feet on high ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand by faith on him. Let's stay the highest. Oh, I want to scare the out [Music] of glory. [Music] Oh, lift me up and let me down. I feel [Music] so high. [Music] me. Oh Lord, Lord, lift me up. Oh, [Music] so love.
