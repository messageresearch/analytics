[18:27] Amen.
[18:29] Are you there?
[18:34] Amen. So, let's read in the name of the
[18:36] Lord.
[18:38] Then the children of Judah came unto
[18:40] Joshua in Gal.
[18:43] And Caleb the son of Jeffy the Kennesite
[18:45] said unto him, "Thou knowest the thing
[18:48] that the Lord said unto Moses, the man
[18:50] of God, concerning me, and thee in
[18:53] Kadesh Bania,
[18:55] 40 years old was I then when Moses, the
[19:00] servant of the Lord, sent me from
[19:02] Kadeshiban to spy out the land. and I
[19:06] brought him
[19:09] word again as it was in mine heart.
[19:14] Verse 8, nevertheless, my brethren that
[19:16] went up with me made the heart of the
[19:19] people melt, but I followed the Lord my
[19:23] God. And Moses swear on that day,
[19:27] saying, Surely the land where thy feet
[19:30] have told shall be thine inheritance,
[19:34] and thy children forever, because thou
[19:37] has h wholly followed the Lord my
[19:42] because thou has followed the Lord my
[19:44] God. Verse 10. And now, behold, the Lord
[19:48] has kept me alive, as he said, these 40
[19:52] and five years, even since the Lord
[19:54] spake this word unto Moses, while the
[19:57] children of Israel wandered in the
[19:59] wilderness. And now, lo, I'm this day
[20:03] four for
[20:05] 5 years old. as yet I'm I'm as strong
[20:11] this day as I was in that day that Moses
[20:15] sent me. As my strength was then, even
[20:19] so is my strength now for war both to go
[20:23] out and to come in. Now therefore give
[20:26] me this mountain whereof the Lord spake
[20:29] in that day. For thou hardest in that
[20:33] day, how the anarchims were there, that
[20:36] the cities were great and fenced. If so
[20:40] be, the Lord will be with me, then I
[20:44] shall be able to drive them out, as the
[20:47] Lord said. Verse 13, and Joseph blessed
[20:51] him, and gave Caleb, the son of Jeffy,
[20:55] Hebron, for an inheritance. Verse 14.
[20:59] Hebron therefore became the inheritance
[21:02] of Calb, the son of Jeff the Kennesite,
[21:05] unto this day because that he followed
[21:10] the Lord God of Israel.
[21:13] I can read.
[22:01] Amen.
[22:53] Amen.
[22:58] Got it.
[23:04] forchech.
[23:35] Amen.
[23:37] Amen. Let's go to the New Testament.
[23:42] Ephesians chapter 1.
[23:59] Then let's read verse 11.
[24:02] You can read the whole chapter from
[24:04] verse one
[24:09] as it flows.
[24:12] But let's go to verse 11.
[24:16] Ephesians chapter 1 vers 11.
[24:19] In whom also we have obtained an
[24:22] inheritance, being predestinated
[24:25] according to the purpose of him who
[24:27] workketh all things after the council of
[24:31] his own will.
[24:49] Let's pray.
[24:51] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[24:53] Christ,
[24:56] we thank you for this morning.
[24:58] Thank you for gathering us.
[25:01] Thank you for this fellowship,
[25:04] your servant, Pastor
[25:09] and all the believers
[25:11] in this place. Lord, we pray father
[25:15] that you speak to our hearts.
[25:18] Reveal thy word
[25:20] for each one of us, Lord.
[25:23] Lift us up. Take us a step higher.
[25:27] Let us be transformed
[25:30] by the power of the Holy Spirit. Let us
[25:32] be blessed
[25:34] by thee, Father.
[25:36] Let us live here in the testimony that
[25:40] surely we have heard from you.
[25:44] those who are in the live stream. May
[25:48] you bless them. May you meet the needs
[25:51] of every person
[25:54] for your glory, your honor in the name
[25:58] of our Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen
[26:01] and amen. Amen. God bless you.
[26:06] Hallelujah.
[26:07] Hallelujah.
[26:08] Amen.
[26:08] Amen.
[26:08] I greet you once again
[26:11] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[26:13] Hallelujah.
[26:14] Hallelujah.
[26:15] Amen.
[26:16] Amen.
[26:16] So the title of my message
[26:21] possessing your inheritance.
[26:26] Yes.
[26:29] Possessing your inheritance.
[26:33] Hallelujah. Amen. So we see here in the
[26:36] Old Testament
[26:38] had an inheritance.
[26:40] God promise him that you will possess
[26:45] your inheritance
[26:47] something that is for you because you
[26:51] have followed the Lord God of Israel. So
[26:55] Caleb knew that one day
[26:59] I will possess an inheritance. One day I
[27:04] will get Heblon.
[27:06] He went through battles.
[27:08] He went through hard times in the
[27:11] wilderness. They were fighting. They
[27:14] many died. But Caleb would not die. He
[27:19] couldn't die because he had an inherit.
[27:24] One day he had to get it. God kept him
[27:28] alive until that day. And he told Joshua
[27:33] that you know what happened? How the
[27:36] children of Israel
[27:38] Many died in the wilderness. How the 10
[27:41] spies
[27:42] who are sent
[27:44] who are sent there were 12. They were
[27:48] sent when they came back. 10 spies gave
[27:53] a report that made the heart of the
[27:57] hearts of people melt.
[28:00] But Joshua and
[28:04] we are different.
[28:05] They they had a purpose.
[28:08] They were up to something. They were not
[28:10] to stop in the wilderness. They were to
[28:13] enter the promised land and possess an
[28:18] inheritance.
[28:19] Hallelujah. Amen.
[28:20] He told Mo He told Joshua that you had
[28:24] Moses very well
[28:26] that I have to get an inheritance.
[28:31] Yes, I'm old, but I'm still strong. I
[28:36] can still fight.
[28:37] Hallelujah.
[28:38] Amen.
[28:39] I'm still
[28:41] I still have the vigor.
[28:43] Yes. 45 years.
[28:47] I can still go for war. I can still
[28:50] fight. I possess that inheritance.
[28:54] Hallelujah. So
[28:57] was not giving up. He was not giving a
[29:00] negative report.
[29:02] No, no, no. He was a storm. He knew what
[29:07] God promised him, he was to possess it.
[29:11] Hallelujah. Amen. So my brother, my
[29:13] sister, as had an inheritance, you also
[29:17] have an inheritance.
[29:19] Hallelujah. Amen. God gave you an
[29:21] inheritance
[29:23] because it has said in Ephesians
[29:27] 1 11
[29:29] Jesus Christ obtained
[29:32] an inheritance.
[29:34] Hallelujah. Amen. And you want to look
[29:36] at that inheritance.
[29:40] His inheritance was Hebron
[29:43] was a mountain. Hallelujah. But for us
[29:47] we have a spiritual inheritance.
[29:50] Hallelujah. And you have to possess it.
[29:54] Hallelujah. Amen. And the prophet says,
[29:57] God gave you this inheritance
[30:01] before the foundation of the world.
[30:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And our Lord
[30:07] Jesus Christ died on the cross make a
[30:11] way for you to get to your inheritance.
[30:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Now listen to the
[30:20] prophet. I like to quote the prophet.
[30:24] Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Now
[30:29] listen. He says here the message
[30:32] adoption
[30:34] to God. He says here inheritance by
[30:37] predestination.
[30:40] Adoption
[30:45] 177.
[30:47] It says inheritance by predestination.
[30:51] I inherited something.
[30:54] What inheritance?
[30:57] There had to be somebody
[31:00] leave me an inheritance.
[31:02] Why? You say Jesus left me left you an
[31:05] inheritance.
[31:08] Beg your pardon. Jesus
[31:11] never left me an inheritance.
[31:15] Jesus never left you an inheritance.
[31:19] He only came down.
[31:22] He paid your paid for your inheritance.
[31:31] Yes, sir.
[31:31] Amen.
[31:32] Hallelujah.
[31:33] Hallelujah.
[31:33] So Jesus came on the cross and died to
[31:39] make a way for you and me to get to our
[31:43] inheritance.
[31:45] Why? Because we are sons and daughters
[31:49] of God.
[31:51] Jesus came on the cross.
[31:54] Amen.
[31:56] We are there in the mind of God.
[32:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Before the devil
[32:02] was created,
[32:04] Satan was created.
[32:10] [screaming] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[32:13] Amen. And that's what God asked Job.
[32:16] Where was thou when the sons of God
[32:20] shouted for Job in the morning star
[32:24] together? Hallelujah. Amen. Where was
[32:26] thou? When I laid the foundation of the
[32:29] world. Hallelujah. Amen. [screaming] We
[32:31] were thou. Amen. Amen.
[32:34] So he was asking Job where he was thou
[32:37] remind
[32:41] where he was that he was not in this
[32:44] time.
[32:47] He was there in the mind of God. Amen.
[32:52] Even though even though he has gone
[32:56] through problems, he has gone through
[32:58] trials. He has gone through sicknesses,
[33:01] but he will not fail. He's victorious.
[33:05] He's an overcomer because we are there
[33:08] in the mind of God was there before the
[33:12] foundation of the world. Hallelujah.
[33:14] Amen. Amen. He was passing through
[33:19] those trials, those hard times that he
[33:22] was go back
[33:24] where he came from. Hallelujah.
[33:27] Amen.
[33:27] And Job he gave he got the revelation.
[33:33] He said, even thy die.
[33:37] Amen. Amen. Even the wombs
[33:40] eat my flesh. One day I will see my
[33:44] redeemer.
[33:45] I will see my redeemer. He was speaking
[33:48] about the resurrection. That one day you
[33:52] resurrect.
[33:53] Hallelujah. Amen. So my friend, my
[33:55] brother, my sister, you have an
[33:58] inheritance.
[34:00] Your inheritance
[34:02] was yours.
[34:04] Was [screaming] yours
[34:07] before you are born.
[34:10] That's why you are born.
[34:12] That's why you are here. That's why
[34:14] you're hearing the gospel. The gospel,
[34:17] your being here is a way is a channel
[34:22] make you rich inheritance. [screaming]
[34:26] Hallelujah. Amen.
[34:28] Oh my my my.
[34:29] Hallelujah.
[34:29] Hallelujah.
[34:30] Amen.
[34:31] Yes sir.
[34:32] Oh my. Amen.
[34:33] So he says your inheritance was there.
[34:38] Jesus Christ died
[34:40] to make a way for you to get to your
[34:43] inheritance.
[34:45] So
[34:46] Jesus Christ,
[34:48] yes,
[34:48] died.
[34:49] Hallelujah. Amen.
[34:51] To bring you your inheritance.
[34:55] But your name
[34:58] was put on the lamb's book of life
[35:02] from the foundation of

[35:09] God gave you your inheritance.
[35:13] Hallelujah.
[35:14] Amen.
[35:16] Your inheritance was fast.
[35:21] Your inheritance was fast.
[35:25] Jesus only come.
[35:28] Amen. Oh my. And he says, "Oh," he says,
[35:32] "Uhhuh, here's the way."
[35:35] They try to make it.
[35:39] God is saying,
[35:42] "There's a lot of people
[35:45] who who are lost.
[35:48] Not one of them will be saved.
[35:51] So I will send Jesus down there
[35:55] and perhaps
[35:57] maybe somebody will feel sorry
[36:02] and know what I have done
[36:05] and get saved. Oh mercy I wouldn't run
[36:09] my office like that
[36:12] even as as poor as I do run it.
[36:18] I wouldn't do it that way.
[36:21] How about God?
[36:24] Oh,
[36:25] God [screaming]
[36:27] is not
[36:28] taking chances
[36:34] betting you know.
[36:38] Give this one Jesus die
[36:42] somewhere.
[36:46] No,
[36:47] God is not like that.
[36:49] Praise be to God.
[36:51] Hallelujah. Listen. Paragraph 178.
[36:56] Oh my. Amen. He says paragraph 178.
[37:01] He says God God by his for knowledge.
[37:11] He is seen exactly who would be saved.
[37:23] He knew for hand and saw what was to
[37:27] come.
[37:28] Mhm.
[37:30] Seen exactly who would be saved
[37:34] and who would not be saved.
[37:37] So he sent Jesus
[37:39] to save those
[37:42] who whom he had already chosen.
[37:47] So God looked in this day
[37:52] in this age and saw you and me
[37:56] who will be saved
[37:59] and when he saw us
[38:01] that we will be saved
[38:04] then he chose us.
[38:07] And he sent Jesus to die for each one of
[38:11] us. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And when he
[38:15] saw all that, he started working on it.
[38:20] Hallelujah. Amen.
[38:22] So you are coming here today
[38:25] by accident.
[38:27] It is God's plan
[38:30] for you to be here today.
[38:33] this way
[38:36] rest. Hallelujah.
[38:38] And that's why nothing can stop us
[38:43] in our journey.
[38:45] Hallelujah.
[38:46] Amen.
[38:48] Oh my my.
[38:51] Oh my. Didn't Paul say
[38:54] five verses behind this?
[39:01] He says Paul said
[39:04] that he chose us in him
[39:08] before there was a world.
[39:15] That's our inheritance.
[39:18] God chose us
[39:21] and let Jesus come
[39:24] and pay the price.
[39:26] Hallelujah. Amen. that what
[39:29] his shedding of his blood
[39:33] that no sin
[39:35] would be accounted to us.
[39:39] Hallelujah.
[39:40] Amen.
[39:41] Oh my.
[39:42] He says nothing you do.
[39:45] It is him who did it.
[39:48] Hallelujah.
[39:50] Amen.
[39:50] Amen.
[39:51] And that's our inheritance.
[39:53] Our inheritance
[39:55] is already paid for
[39:59] already ours
[40:01] right now. We are possessing it
[40:06] day by day. We are possessing it. As you
[40:10] come to church, you are possessing it.
[40:13] When you heard the gospel,
[40:16] when you had the gospel and you accepted
[40:18] Jesus Christ and you repented of your
[40:21] sin and you are baptized in the name of
[40:24] Jesus Christ, what were you doing
[40:28] possessing
[40:30] inheritance?
[40:32] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[40:32] Amen.
[40:34] Possessing inheritance is a process.
[40:41] taking your inheritance is a process.
[40:43] Hallelujah. Amen.
[40:45] When
[40:47] possess the mountain,
[40:49] he never took it immediately in seconds.
[40:54] No, no, no. Can you imagine even first
[40:57] go to Joshua
[41:00] and told
[41:02] you what Moses said that I I have to
[41:05] possess my inheritance and he told him
[41:09] what happened
[41:11] and Joshua told him surely
[41:14] you have to possess inheritance I give
[41:18] you
[41:20] for your inheritance and had to get
[41:23] swords
[41:25] to get spears had to go out there and
[41:29] fight [screaming]
[41:30] and drive off everybody who was on his
[41:34] mountain so that he can possess
[41:38] Hallelujah.
[41:39] Amen.
[41:41] It may have taken him days.
[41:45] It may have taken him weeks or months,
[41:48] but he had to fight every day, every day
[41:53] until he got his mountain.
[41:56] Hallelujah.
[41:57] Amen.
[41:58] That's why Christianity
[42:00] is not one day.
[42:04] No. Hallelujah. You enter, you become
[42:08] saved.
[42:10] You repent. You are baptized in water.
[42:14] You are you come out. You are
[42:17] sanctified.
[42:18] You claim the Holy Ghost and pray one
[42:22] month, two months, three months, four
[42:26] months until the Holy Spirit comes.
[42:30] The prophet prayed for six months to get
[42:34] the Holy Spirit. So my brother, that's
[42:37] what it means to get an inheritance.
[42:41] Hallelujah. Amen.
[42:43] We are still possessing.
[42:45] We are still possessing.
[42:47] Whatever you possess,
[42:49] that's yours because
[42:54] where you lay your feet
[42:56] will be your possession.
[42:59] So day by day he was laying a feet and
[43:03] that was his he was laying a and that
[43:07] was and that's how it should be for you
[43:11] a Christian
[43:13] every day you should claim something
[43:16] every day you should get a step high
[43:20] you should move forward hallelujah amen
[43:24] don't stay in one place so a Christian
[43:27] is in a journey
[43:30] possessing his inheritance
[43:33] until the climax
[43:37] which we shall see.
[43:39] Hallelujah.
[43:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So my brother,
[43:42] my sister, we are here to possess.
[43:46] We are here to possess. We are here to
[43:48] get somewhere.

[44:13] called
[44:14] before the foundation of the world.
[44:17] Amen. So when you are born here
[44:21] when you were born
[44:23] by your mother and father.
[44:26] Amen. for you. You didn't know that you
[44:29] have an inheritance. But one day you
[44:32] heard the gospel and one day you
[44:36] responded to the call of the gospel.
[44:40] Why did you respond?
[44:44] Preachers preach
[44:48] and many listen.
[44:51] Some abuse.
[44:53] Some laugh at the gospel.
[44:55] criticize,
[44:57] but you when you had it, you accepted
[45:01] it. Sometimes
[45:04] some of us were a little bit hesitant.
[45:08] Amen. When we had never made a decision
[45:12] right away, but there was something
[45:16] which followed us, convicting us,
[45:19] convicting us, convicting us until we
[45:23] had no peace.
[45:25] And we said [screaming]
[45:28] this is the truth. I have to follow it.
[45:33] Oh my.
[45:35] Oh my my. Amen.
[45:37] My brother. If I can give you a
[45:39] testimony.
[45:41] How I believed in this message.
[45:47] And the brother preached to me the
[45:49] gospel.
[45:50] Preached me the message of the Lord.
[45:53] and he showed me. He gave me a magazine.
[45:58] The Lord God has spoken.
[46:00] I saw it. There was a man with a pill
[46:04] with a a light on his head.
[46:07] I said, "My Bible told I I saw it."
[46:14] So this is the man. He's calling him a
[46:16] prophet.
[46:19] But the Bible said in the end time there
[46:21] will be false prophets.
[46:26] I said
[46:27] I went on my knees. I was an angry.
[46:34] So I prayed. I said, "Lord, if this is
[46:38] true, if this man is is is your prophet,
[46:43] guide me." I left it at that. Then it
[46:47] took time but one day a voice spoke I
[46:53] was convicted
[46:55] one night and I cried tears
[46:58] that this is the truth. voice was
[47:01] telling me that's the truth
[47:04] follow it
[47:06] and he had preached to me the gospel in
[47:10] I had come to campala
[47:16] by the time I was convicted
[47:18] I was in campa
[47:20] and I was in a place and I don't know
[47:23] where to turn it I have been convicted
[47:27] I want to get to this truth
[47:31] fellowship
[47:33] beapt
[47:39] to God. And one day this brother,
[47:44] brother Alfred
[47:46] came not knowing where I am.
[47:51] He came, the Holy Spirit led him
[47:54] and I was in India in the suburbs there
[48:00] and I saw him entering the compound
[48:06] without knowing where I am. There were
[48:09] no phones at that time.
[48:12] There was no kind of communication.
[48:15] But the Holy Spirit led him. The same
[48:19] Holy Spirit
[48:21] that led Philip to the unic. Hallelujah.
[48:26] Amen. The same Holy Spirit made that
[48:29] brother
[48:30] came where he was staying
[48:34] and I told him how did you come that

[48:40] that time here

[48:51] Amen.
[48:52] My

[48:57] where the fellowship is. Amen. And I

[49:03] I attended fellowship there.
[49:06] And then I accepted the message baptized
[49:10] me in the name of Jesus Christ. So my
[49:13] brother, my sister, wherever you are,

[49:55] So when you had the gospel,
[49:59] you couldn't help it.
[50:02] You couldn't stop.
[50:04] You couldn't refuse.
[50:07] There was a force. There was a force.
[50:10] There was a power which was pushing you
[50:14] to believe it.
[50:16] That was the call of God.
[50:19] He was calling you come and possess
[50:23] your inheritance.

[1:01:26] I never deviated from
[1:01:29] I never took any church credits of
[1:01:32] anything else
[1:01:34] the same
[1:01:37] and listen to this and all the people
[1:01:39] who are there
[1:01:42] when he was saying this all of them
[1:01:44] scream
[1:01:46] one voice and said, "We know that
[1:01:50] we are resting
[1:01:52] with assurance."
[1:01:55] And they said, "You will present us to
[1:01:58] him."
[1:02:00] Hallelujah. And we go back to the earth
[1:02:05] and live forever.
[1:02:08] Hallelujah. Amen. My brother, my sister,
[1:02:11] what preached
[1:02:14] is what brother preached
[1:02:17] in this nation
[1:02:19] possessing our
[1:02:22] preached
[1:02:24] preach
[1:02:25] and we preach it and we believe it.
[1:02:29] Hallelujah.
[1:02:30] And the people
[1:02:33] who believed
[1:02:35] the message
[1:02:39] some had crossed
[1:02:41] some we are there and they were
[1:02:43] testifying.
[1:02:45] Hallelujah. I told him we are standing
[1:02:48] on that.
[1:02:51] Amen.
[1:02:52] My so what we preach
[1:02:56] is already tested
[1:02:59] is already proved.
[1:03:01] He has already made people
[1:03:05] enter [screaming]
[1:03:07] beyond the curtain of time
[1:03:10] enter heaven
[1:03:12] paradise
[1:03:14] and they are waiting
[1:03:16] for us who are here on earth.
[1:03:19] Hallelujah. and to possess our
[1:03:22] inheritance.
[1:03:25] So the message of the hour,
[1:03:29] the gospel we preach
[1:03:33] has already made people enter heaven
[1:03:40] and they were there and they told
[1:03:43] brother
[1:03:45] we are standing on that.
[1:03:48] They are there and telling him we are
[1:03:50] standing on that.
[1:03:54] When he crossed they told him we are
[1:03:58] already here.
[1:04:03] We are here. The message you preach.
[1:04:08] It made us come here. It brought us
[1:04:11] here. We are here. We are here and we
[1:04:15] are resting on that which you preached
[1:04:18] on. Hallelujah.
[1:04:21] That is why.
[1:04:23] Amen. Others have already reached with
[1:04:26] it.
[1:04:29] So for us, we are still moving with it.
[1:04:34] Whoever crosses,
[1:04:36] whoever goes, we give God the glory and
[1:04:39] we remain moving. We continue pressing.
[1:04:43] Hallelujah. Oh my.
[1:04:45] Hallelujah.
[1:04:46] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:04:48] Hallelujah.

[1:04:50] Amen.
[1:04:51] Oh, possessing our inheritance.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:56] We must possess it.
[1:04:59] And now and he said when I was now he
[1:05:03] was coming back to his body
[1:05:06] and then he looked at his body
[1:05:09] and when he saw his body he said I have
[1:05:12] to come back to this wrinkled body
[1:05:17] and then a voice started speaking to
[1:05:19] him.
[1:05:20] In paragraph 98
[1:05:23] in the same message adoption
[1:05:26] and he says I kept hearing that voice
[1:05:28] Keep pressing more.
[1:05:33] I said Lord always believed in divine
[1:05:36] healing
[1:05:38] giving it but I will press
[1:05:42] for them souls. So help me. I have so
[1:05:47] many there.
[1:05:49] Let me leave Lord. I'll put on and I'll
[1:05:52] put another million there.
[1:05:56] Just let me live.
[1:06:02] So my brother, my sister, there is a
[1:06:04] purpose why we are here. We are here to
[1:06:09] possess our inheritance. We are here
[1:06:14] reach somewhere.
[1:06:16] Hallelujah. Amen. That's the purpose
[1:06:19] that we are called. You are called to
[1:06:21] possess your inheritance. Your
[1:06:24] inheritance includes the baptism of the
[1:06:28] Holy
[1:06:29] Baptism of the Holy Spirit is part of
[1:06:32] your inheritance.
[1:06:34] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:35] You shouldn't stop at being baptized in
[1:06:37] Jesus name.
[1:06:40] Continue pressing God. Continue fighting
[1:06:43] God. Continue praying until you are
[1:06:47] filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:49] And when you are filled, don't stop
[1:06:51] there. It's not over. There's more to
[1:06:55] possess.
[1:06:57] You are filled.
[1:06:58] You are you have just laid a foundation
[1:07:02] in the kingdom of God.
[1:07:05] You are born by the Holy Spirit and by
[1:07:08] the word. Hallelujah. And when you are
[1:07:11] born, oh my brother, my sister, you have
[1:07:14] to continue eating.
[1:07:16] You have to continue eating.
[1:07:19] is born.
[1:07:22] That
[1:07:23] has to continue drinking,
[1:07:26] let alone food,
[1:07:29] later on meat.
[1:07:31] And as this child eats,
[1:07:34] this child grows.
[1:07:38] The one who was crowing
[1:07:40] starts walking. The one who was walking
[1:07:44] starts running. The one who was shot
[1:07:46] like this [snorts] starts to grow. Time
[1:07:50] comes. When this child goes to school
[1:07:54] and this child studies after studies,
[1:07:58] this this child is no longer child now.
[1:08:02] He's a youth. He marries. He gets
[1:08:05] children. Hallelujah. Amen. Gets a
[1:08:08] family.
[1:08:10] Serves God.
[1:08:13] That's it. That's the family in this
[1:08:15] world.
[1:08:17] What about the family of God? What about
[1:08:20] being born in the kingdom of God?
[1:08:22] Born in the family of God, born by the
[1:08:25] Holy Spirit by an experience of the new
[1:08:28] birth
[1:08:31] filled with the Holy Spirit. Yes, that's
[1:08:33] the dove
[1:08:35] to lead you
[1:08:38] in the salvation
[1:08:40] to lead you to perfection
[1:08:43] to lead you adoption. That's why the
[1:08:47] prophet preached the message. You must
[1:08:50] be born.
[1:08:52] He preached the message the new birth.
[1:08:56] He preached the message.
[1:08:58] What was the Holy Ghost giving?
[1:09:01] Amen. And then he preached the message
[1:09:04] adoption.
[1:09:06] And he preached the message stage of the
[1:09:08] perfect
[1:09:10] all those messages we are showing our
[1:09:14] inheritance.
[1:09:19] Are you seeing that?
[1:09:22] Yes. After you have been filled with the
[1:09:24] Holy Spirit,
[1:09:26] wonderful.
[1:09:28] You were child of God and now you have
[1:09:30] to grow.
[1:09:32] You have to possess your inheritance.
[1:09:36] Amen. You have to add your faith virtue.
[1:09:41] You have to add on knowledge.
[1:09:44] Add on temperance. You have to add on
[1:09:46] patience. You have to add on godliness
[1:09:50] on brother.
[1:09:53] That is a Christian journey.
[1:09:56] It's not one.
[1:09:58] It is climbing your mountain.
[1:10:02] It is chasing away.
[1:10:04] It is chasing away the Amorites,
[1:10:07] the Jebites, the Canonites,
[1:10:10] all the people who are occupying
[1:10:14] your mountain
[1:10:16] to chase them away. Hallelujah. As you
[1:10:19] pray, as you come to church, as you
[1:10:23] enter into prayer,
[1:10:26] praise God, cry to God.
[1:10:29] We are the one the Holy Spirit touches
[1:10:33] you being changed for glory glory. Glory
[1:10:40] until one day you reach the maturity.
[1:10:48] Are we together? Are you seeing your
[1:10:50] inheritance?
[1:10:52] So brother
[1:10:56] had to fight and you have to fight.
[1:10:59] We were fighting with his swords,
[1:11:02] fighting with his spears for us. We
[1:11:05] fight
[1:11:07] in a spiritual way, with the word of
[1:11:10] God, with prayer, with fasting.
[1:11:15] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:11:18] Brother,
[1:11:20] I believe in prayer and fasting.
[1:11:27] Fasting is part of Christian life
[1:11:35] as prayer is part of the Christian life.
[1:11:40] The prophet fasted
[1:11:43] and prayed. Our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:46] fasted.
[1:11:49] The apostles,
[1:11:51] prayed and fasted.
[1:11:54] Believers should do the same.
[1:11:58] If there are things which are not moving
[1:12:02] in your life, dedicate time
[1:12:06] and pray and fast
[1:12:10] to move
[1:12:12] certain hurdles.
[1:12:16] Amen.
[1:12:18] You remember one time.
[1:12:20] There was a demon
[1:12:24] a boy
[1:12:25] had epip
[1:12:28] and was brought to the apostles.
[1:12:30] The disciples they could not cast out
[1:12:35] and then that child was brought to Jesus
[1:12:40] and Jesus cast away the
[1:12:43] disciples asked him privately.
[1:12:48] Yes, you gave us power,
[1:12:50] but this demon
[1:12:53] wouldn't go away.
[1:12:56] And he said, "Such
[1:12:59] cannot go away
[1:13:02] unless you pray and fast.
[1:13:07] Are you hearing that? There are things
[1:13:11] which may refuse to go
[1:13:14] unless you enter into prayer and
[1:13:16] fasting.
[1:13:21] That's right.
[1:13:22] So, brother, sister, use that weapon
[1:13:28] to fight for inheritance.
[1:13:33] Amen.
[1:13:34] Hallelujah.
[1:13:35] Hallelujah. So my brother, my sister,
[1:13:38] as you are growing,
[1:13:40] as you are praying, as you come to
[1:13:43] church, hallelujah, we are possessing
[1:13:47] our inheritance, the seven virtues,
[1:13:51] the seven character
[1:13:54] of Jesus Christ in the message of the
[1:13:57] perfect man
[1:13:59] is part of our inheritance.
[1:14:05] We should claim it. We should possess it
[1:14:09] day by day as prayer.
[1:14:12] Pray for that
[1:14:15] because
[1:14:17] unless we strike a perfection,
[1:14:22] the rapture cannot take place.
[1:14:27] Listen to this in the message stage of
[1:14:31] the perfect.
[1:14:33] Listen to what the prophet says.
[1:14:36] Oh, hallelujah. You love him. Give up to
[1:14:39] the Lord.
[1:14:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:14:44] Praise be to God. Amen. The message
[1:14:47] stage of the perfect man.
[1:14:50] The prophet says this.
[1:14:54] Amen. This is part of our inheritance.
[1:14:58] You get it. Search of the perfect man
[1:15:02] paragraph 366
[1:15:06] says you get this.
[1:15:09] These people here who died in Christ
[1:15:13] in here are depending
[1:15:18] and waiting on us.
[1:15:20] Do you see why we are called?
[1:15:23] They are depending and waiting on who?
[1:15:28] On who?
[1:15:30] you me.
[1:15:33] Oh, and he says,
[1:15:35] "So this church
[1:15:37] has got to come to perfection
[1:15:42] in order to bring the resurrection.
[1:15:49] Hallelujah. That is part of our
[1:15:51] inheritance.
[1:15:54] We must grow.
[1:15:57] We must add them seven virtues
[1:16:00] to reach perfection
[1:16:03] for what? To bring about the
[1:16:04] resurrection.
[1:16:07] Because before the rapture takes place,
[1:16:10] there must be resurrection
[1:16:13] of the sleeping saints.
[1:16:15] Those who died in Christ
[1:16:18] from the first church age,
[1:16:21] they are waiting for the believers, the
[1:16:25] bride
[1:16:28] of this age to come to perfection.
[1:16:33] That's why God had to reveal all the
[1:16:37] trees, the seven seals, the seven church
[1:16:40] ages,
[1:16:42] seven thunders, every mystery that was
[1:16:45] hidden,
[1:16:47] revealed to bring out the entire plan of
[1:16:51] redemption
[1:16:57] so that we can see our position
[1:17:00] in Christ. can inherit
[1:17:04] and raise up to possess it.
[1:17:07] Hallelujah. Can you clap to the Lord?
[1:17:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:17:15] my.
[1:17:17] Oh my my. And he says
[1:17:19] and they under souls under the altar
[1:17:23] waiting for this church
[1:17:26] come to this perfection.
[1:17:28] And when Christ
[1:17:30] does come
[1:17:34] The rapture cannot take place.
[1:17:38] We have fully possessed our inheritance
[1:17:45] in full possession.
[1:17:47] Yes. Amen.
[1:17:48] Hallelujah.
[1:17:49] Amen.
[1:17:49] So our our inheritance
[1:17:52] includes the baptism of the Holy Spir
[1:17:56] includes Hallelujah.
[1:17:58] Amen. Amen. includes faith, virtue,
[1:18:02] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:18:06] godliness.
[1:18:09] And then we are adopted,
[1:18:13] placed in position of authority
[1:18:17] and power restored back to Eden.
[1:18:21] Then you go back
[1:18:24] in that authority that Adam had before
[1:18:28] the fall.
[1:18:32] That's all our inheritance.
[1:18:36] Hallelujah.
[1:18:36] Amen. My my my day by day we are
[1:18:40] possessed.
[1:18:41] We are getting step by step.
[1:18:45] Yes. Hallelujah. Amen. So we must get
[1:18:48] into that authority.
[1:18:52] character.
[1:18:56] God has to give us character.
[1:18:59] The prophet said God cannot entrust us
[1:19:02] with his power
[1:19:06] until we have character
[1:19:10] handle it.
[1:19:12] Right now we have power
[1:19:15] under control.
[1:19:17] It is in measure.
[1:19:23] But we are talking about the fullness
[1:19:26] which is coming.
[1:19:31] Adoption
[1:19:35] is
[1:19:38] perfection. Adoption will be released
[1:19:42] through power, true authority
[1:19:46] of adopted sons and daughters.
[1:19:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir. The prophet
[1:19:54] speaks about a a child born
[1:19:57] in a family. When a child is young
[1:20:01] cannot be given full authority,
[1:20:04] cannot sign on a check,
[1:20:06] cannot drive a car,
[1:20:09] cannot go
[1:20:11] here and do this and this. But when a
[1:20:14] child has been trained
[1:20:17] under tutors
[1:20:20] and he has been proved
[1:20:23] to have the right character,
[1:20:25] he was given full authority.
[1:20:28] If you sign on the church on behalf of
[1:20:31] his father, he can do the work of his
[1:20:34] father and we we are undergoing training
[1:20:40] right now. What's going on
[1:20:42] is bride training.
[1:20:45] We are being trained
[1:20:48] through trials,
[1:20:50] through problems,
[1:20:52] through sickness,
[1:20:54] as we come to church, as we pray, as we
[1:20:57] believe God,
[1:20:59] different things.
[1:21:02] Some things we believe
[1:21:04] take a long to happen
[1:21:08] and you cry unto God [screaming]
[1:21:10] and things don't change. Don't worry.
[1:21:13] God is at work. He's training you. He's
[1:21:18] giving you patience.
[1:21:20] If you perseverance,
[1:21:22] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:21:23] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody
[1:21:27] abuses you. Somebody speaks against you.
[1:21:31] Somebody does this and this
[1:21:34] forgive them. You are getting brotherly
[1:21:37] kindness.
[1:21:39] Some even may be your brothers.
[1:21:43] Amen. But it's okay. God has let it be
[1:21:48] so that you get character.
[1:21:51] Hallelujah. Amen. Oh my. Character
[1:21:54] building
[1:21:57] is being carried out.
[1:22:00] by the Holy Spirit in the bride so that
[1:22:05] we get our inheritance
[1:22:09] fullness.
[1:22:12] Hallelujah.
[1:22:12] Hallelujah. My so inheritance
[1:22:16] includes adoption.
[1:22:21] Oh my. Amen. Romans 8 speaks about
[1:22:25] manifestation
[1:22:27] of the sons of God. All creation
[1:22:30] are waiting for the manifestation
[1:22:34] of the sons and we are those sons
[1:22:38] who should be manifested in our day. It
[1:22:42] is part of our inheritance.
[1:22:45] Amen. So when you get character
[1:22:49] when we get character
[1:22:51] give us full power.
[1:22:54] power to speak the word. When we speak
[1:22:57] the word, what we what we speak will be
[1:23:02] manifested. Power of the spoken word
[1:23:05] as it was in the life of our prophet
[1:23:09] William.
[1:23:11] He went through training.
[1:23:13] He got character and God gave him power
[1:23:17] of the spoken word.
[1:23:20] spoke and what he spoke was manifest.
[1:23:25] We shall speak the lamb will walk. The
[1:23:29] blind will see our loved ones who are
[1:23:31] not yet saved.
[1:23:34] Brother sister before the rapture
[1:23:38] you will speak and your son will be
[1:23:41] saved. You will speak your brother will
[1:23:45] be saved. You will speak your relatives
[1:23:48] will be saved.
[1:23:50] Hallelujah.
[1:23:51] Because you will have full authority.
[1:23:55] That authority, your word which you
[1:23:58] speak the Holy Spirit will go with it.
[1:24:03] Hallelujah. And when you tell your
[1:24:05] brother, your son, your daughter, your
[1:24:08] mother, your uncle, your aunt, and tell
[1:24:12] them today you are saved, you are
[1:24:15] getting saved
[1:24:17] right now.
[1:24:19] that word, the Holy Spirit will go with
[1:24:22] it and convict
[1:24:26] the soul of that relative of yours. And
[1:24:30] at that moment, your relative will
[1:24:34] repent and accept Jesus as his Lord and
[1:24:38] Savior. The same way happened
[1:24:42] to sister's sons.
[1:24:46] My brother, my sister, That's our
[1:24:48] inheritance. Salvation of our loved
[1:24:52] ones. You keep pressing on. Hallelujah.
[1:24:56] You will reach there. God called us for
[1:24:59] that.
[1:25:01] My my my So my brother, my sister, there
[1:25:05] is a land to possess.
[1:25:07] There's an inheritance to possess.
[1:25:10] Hallelujah. Amen. And the climax of it
[1:25:13] will be
[1:25:16] the resurrection because the prophet
[1:25:19] said, "Hallelujah." Amen.
[1:25:21] In the message, what was the Holy Ghost
[1:25:24] given for?
[1:25:26] He says, "Hallelujah. That power
[1:25:30] that will resurrect
[1:25:32] the sleeping saints
[1:25:34] is in us will be in us. It's building
[1:25:38] building."
[1:25:40] And by climax
[1:25:42] at the climax that power which will be
[1:25:46] manifested in the perfected bride.
[1:25:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Will shake the world
[1:25:54] shake the denomination
[1:25:56] at that moment the denomination
[1:25:59] will know
[1:26:03] was a prophet of God.
[1:26:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother there's going
[1:26:07] to be a shaking.
[1:26:10] the bride shaking
[1:26:13] the world through the power of God.
[1:26:17] He spoke it in the message
[1:26:19] speak to this mountain. He said the
[1:26:22] church of the living God is moving
[1:26:25] towards fear.
[1:26:27] Amen.
[1:26:29] Anointing will strike the church of the
[1:26:33] living God and they speak the word and
[1:26:37] the will walk. They speak the word. The
[1:26:40] dead will be raised and they will shake
[1:26:42] the the world
[1:26:46] with the power of the living God.
[1:26:49] That's right.
[1:26:52] And we are moving into that. It is part
[1:26:55] of our inheritance
[1:26:57] right now. People don't even know us.
[1:27:03] You speak about brother. Brother
[1:27:06] who is that?
[1:27:08] We have a fellowship in a school.
[1:27:12] Our fellowship is in a school.
[1:27:15] We have a church. There are believers in
[1:27:18] the community.
[1:27:20] and school students
[1:27:23] and these students come from different
[1:27:25] religions
[1:27:28] and you preach to them the messenger.
[1:27:31] We speak about the messenger
[1:27:33] we speak about brother
[1:27:36] and they wonder who is that.
[1:27:39] One young man told us, "But this gospel
[1:27:41] you preach,
[1:27:44] people don't know it.
[1:27:47] There are many saved people, but you, we
[1:27:49] don't hear of you.
[1:27:53] They don't know us. But don't worry,
[1:27:57] we cannot be known everywhere."
[1:28:00] But let me tell you, at the back of the
[1:28:02] desert,
[1:28:04] God is at work.
[1:28:06] Hallelujah. He's shaping us a great
[1:28:15] working
[1:28:17] masterpiece.
[1:28:21] Amen. When a great masterpiece is being
[1:28:23] worked upon
[1:28:26] cannot be displayed.
[1:28:29] Amen. It is always hidden somewhere.
[1:28:32] And every day the master's character,
[1:28:37] he comes with his hammer
[1:28:40] and he hits and knocks. He comes with
[1:28:43] his chisel and he cuts this cuts that
[1:28:48] this and people don't see that.
[1:28:52] He's doing it behind the cages.
[1:28:56] He's doing it behind the desert.
[1:28:59] Oh my. He's doing it in a closet.
[1:29:06] Hallelujah. Amen. But when the work is
[1:29:08] done,
[1:29:10] the masterpiece is finished.
[1:29:13] My brother, my sister, there has to be a
[1:29:16] ceremony.
[1:29:18] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:29:19] of unveiling
[1:29:22] the great masterpiece
[1:29:25] that God has been built.
[1:29:27] Right now the bride of Christ is being
[1:29:32] built
[1:29:33] is possessing
[1:29:35] her inheritance.
[1:29:37] Right now we are growing
[1:29:41] from faith
[1:29:43] to virtue to knowledge to temperance to
[1:29:47] patience to godliness
[1:29:51] and kindness
[1:29:52] until the Holy Ghost
[1:29:57] with charity
[1:29:59] until the cup
[1:30:01] until the head
[1:30:04] will come and seal us.
[1:30:08] And the fullness, the fullness of the
[1:30:11] Holy Spirit will be in us. The fullness
[1:30:16] of the power of the Holy Spirit will be
[1:30:19] in us. And there everybody will see
[1:30:25] that there are people who believe the
[1:30:29] message of the hour.
[1:30:31] There are people who believe the message
[1:30:33] of the hour.
[1:30:35] There are people who believe a prophet
[1:30:39] called William
[1:30:41] and those people have power.
[1:30:44] Those people have authority. Those
[1:30:47] people what they are speaking is coming
[1:30:50] to pass.
[1:30:52] Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] Amen. Oh,
[1:30:55] my brother, my sister, your neighbors,
[1:30:58] your neighbors, they're going to know
[1:31:01] what you believe. Your friends who are
[1:31:04] criticizing you. We know that what you
[1:31:08] believe has power. Even now the power is
[1:31:12] there
[1:31:14] but it has it is under control.
[1:31:18] The control faith.
[1:31:21] That person you want to pray for.
[1:31:24] You have to preach to him first.
[1:31:28] The gospel of healing.
[1:31:30] He has to believe divinely healing
[1:31:34] and then he's healed.
[1:31:38] Are you are you seeing that? The the
[1:31:40] person you want saved,
[1:31:43] you have to preach to him the gospel of
[1:31:46] salvation and he believes it and accepts
[1:31:49] Jesus.
[1:31:51] But now when you're perfected
[1:31:54] another law
[1:31:56] which will come which overrides
[1:32:00] their decision
[1:32:03] which overrides
[1:32:07] whether they like it or not
[1:32:10] has decreed.
[1:32:12] It has to be so. Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:32:15] Amen. My my my oh I feel like more
[1:32:20] things are coming.
[1:32:23] But now listen to this brotherham
[1:32:26] with the power of the spoken word.
[1:32:29] He didn't want the authority of the
[1:32:31] other party. He didn't want he didn't
[1:32:33] have to the other party be convinced.
[1:32:41] No
[1:32:44] with the power of the spoken one.
[1:32:47] God was in control.
[1:32:52] It overrides the other person.
[1:32:57] It overrides everything.
[1:33:00] Look what those sons of Sister Hart.
[1:33:04] They didn't. He just commanded
[1:33:08] and they repented
[1:33:11] the dead fish.
[1:33:16] He just spoke
[1:33:18] and it got life.
[1:33:20] Uhhuh. Sister M is tumor.
[1:33:24] He never went there and preached you
[1:33:28] that can disappear.
[1:33:32] No,
[1:33:35] he just said before the doctors touch my
[1:33:40] let that tumor disappear.
[1:33:44] And the tumor had it obeyed.
[1:33:48] Sister just found the tumor disappear.
[1:33:51] Sister
[1:33:56] confession.
[1:33:58] Hallelujah. It had to override.
[1:34:01] Hallelujah. A situation. My brother, my
[1:34:04] sister, let's press on into that
[1:34:07] situation.
[1:34:09] Let's press on [screaming]
[1:34:11] into that fear.
[1:34:14] Oh my brother, my sister, we're going to
[1:34:16] see the manifestation of
[1:34:19] we are going to be manifested
[1:34:22] as sons and daughters of God
[1:34:26] authority and people will know William
[1:34:30] Brham was a prophet of
[1:34:34] so my sister that power will shake and
[1:34:40] check even the denominations
[1:34:43] will try to touch us and not get us
[1:34:47] because we shall have authority.
[1:34:49] That's when they will know that these
[1:34:52] people have been there.
[1:34:54] These people were we are hidden and now
[1:34:57] they on display.
[1:35:00] Hallelujah. And that power at its climax
[1:35:04] will resurrect the sleepies.
[1:35:09] And that will be the voice of the king
[1:35:15] which is the voice of the resurrection.
[1:35:18] And then in the rapture we
[1:35:22] hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's our
[1:35:23] inheritance.
[1:35:25] That's what you should fight for. That's
[1:35:28] why you should claim
[1:35:30] to possess every day in your prayer.
[1:35:34] Get a step higher.
[1:35:38] Get a step higher. The saints are
[1:35:40] waiting on me.

[1:35:46] the Holy Ghost given.
[1:35:49] Hallelujah. Says the same Holy Spirit.
[1:35:52] Paragraph 50.
[1:35:54] What was the Holy Ghost given for?
[1:35:57] He says, "The same Holy Spirit that
[1:35:59] saved the ruther, that sanctified the
[1:36:01] Methodist, that baptized the Pentecost,

[1:36:26] church
[1:36:28] that it will draw the rest of them from
[1:36:32] the grave.
[1:36:37] Hallelujah. Amen. There will be

[1:36:51] cannot be made perfect. Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] Amen.
[1:36:54] So do you see the Holy Spirit is setting
[1:36:58] in order. He's working on us, preparing
[1:37:02] us for that first resurrection, the
[1:37:05] resurrection of the sleep,
[1:37:08] the climax.

[1:39:09] Are you seeing that all that is our
[1:39:11] inheritance?
[1:39:14] Yes. When our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:16] resurrected
[1:39:18] in his glorified body,
[1:39:21] the disciples were in a room.
[1:39:24] They had closed the doors and he
[1:39:27] appeared in their midst and said peace
[1:39:31] be.
[1:39:33] Hallelujah. My and they saw him. They
[1:39:37] touched him. He was in a body which can
[1:39:39] be touched.
[1:39:41] It was special.
[1:39:43] It could go through a wall. It could
[1:39:46] disappear and
[1:39:48] it could fly.
[1:39:50] And this is so my brother.
[1:39:53] Hallelujah.
[1:39:54] Amen.

[1:41:13] flying.
[1:41:15] And in that body.

[1:41:19] another,
[1:41:21] here on earth,
[1:41:23] the trump of God
[1:41:26] will call us
[1:41:28] to the marriage supper
[1:41:30] to be lifted from this earth and go in

[1:41:37] inheritance.

[1:41:54] us. Even now,
[1:41:58] we are possessing and you shall reach
[1:42:00] the climate.
[1:42:02] But even now, you can receive whatever
[1:42:06] you want.
[1:42:10] When Caleb
[1:42:12] was waiting for his mountain
[1:42:15] before he reached Hebron,
[1:42:17] he enjoyed the blessings of the Lord.
[1:42:20] Yes. When they were in the wilderness,
[1:42:24] when they were sick, they could get
[1:42:26] healing. When they were hungry, God
[1:42:30] could feed them. When they were weak,
[1:42:33] God could strengthen them. He was with
[1:42:35] them. Though there was an inheritance,
[1:42:40] They were moving too
[1:42:46] and they were moving
[1:42:48] an inheritance. They were enjoying
[1:42:52] the blessings of the Lord as moving to
[1:42:54] perfection
[1:42:56] adoption.
[1:42:58] The blessings of the Lord is there.
[1:43:01] The Holy Spirit is here. If you are
[1:43:03] sick, God is here to heal.
[1:43:07] God is here to deliver you. If you need
[1:43:10] a job to give you if you need money, God
[1:43:15] can provide you.
[1:43:18] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:43:20] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:43:21] Even though you don't have what to eat,
[1:43:24] God will give you what to eat. Children
[1:43:26] of Israel. The same God who gave them
[1:43:30] mana from heaven.
[1:43:32] He can give you bread.
[1:43:35] Amen. Amen. So my brother, my sister,
[1:43:39] believe God for your needs because on
[1:43:43] the cross, Jesus Christ made a way
[1:43:48] for you to get whatever you need.
[1:43:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the children
[1:43:53] of Israel, as they were moving to their
[1:43:56] inheritance,
[1:43:58] and they moving to the promised land,
[1:44:00] they got God's blessing.
[1:44:03] They enjoyed healing.
[1:44:05] They enjoyed good health.
[1:44:08] They got heavenly food.
[1:44:11] They got angels food.
[1:44:14] They got protection.
[1:44:16] They got victories in their
[1:44:21] Oh my. Amen. God was with them. The
[1:44:24] presence of the Lord was
[1:44:27] even we ourselves
[1:44:29] are moving to perfection. His presence,
[1:44:34] the power is with us. He's here to heal
[1:44:39] the sick. He's here to deliver those who
[1:44:43] are bound. He's here to provide your
[1:44:46] needs.
[1:44:48] Just believe
[1:44:50] your heart. All things are possible to
[1:44:54] them that believe. Whatever you need,
[1:44:58] whatever you need, whatever you need,
[1:45:01] Jesus paid for
[1:45:04] your wife. Amen.
[1:45:07] Listen to this.
[1:45:09] Some children of God,
[1:45:11] they don't want to enjoy their blessings
[1:45:13] here on earth.
[1:45:16] Some want to preach about perfection,
[1:45:18] adoption.
[1:45:21] Some
[1:45:24] when you preach about possessing things,
[1:45:27] some can condemn you.
[1:45:30] Some can call you that is world
[1:45:33] that is lotism
[1:45:37] things like that. Let me tell you the
[1:45:40] gospel includes eternal life
[1:45:44] and physical life. God promised to bless
[1:45:47] us here
[1:45:49] give us eternal life
[1:45:52] for me for me. I will believe God for
[1:45:56] the blessings that I'm supposed to
[1:45:59] receive here on earth and also believe
[1:46:03] him to perfect me, adopt me, take me
[1:46:08] into the right,
[1:46:10] eternal life is mine. I already have it.
[1:46:15] The Holy Ghost is mine. I already have
[1:46:18] him. And day by day, he's refilling me.
[1:46:23] He's refing me.
[1:46:25] As he's refitting me, I say, "Lord,
[1:46:28] thank you for the refer.
[1:46:31] I also need a blessing
[1:46:33] in my job. Lord, Lord, I need a car.
[1:46:40] Lord, I need a house. I'm [screaming]
[1:46:44] tired of renting."
[1:46:46] You see?
[1:46:48] Amen.
[1:46:51] Come on. I believe in the full gospel.
[1:46:55] I believe in the full gospel.
[1:46:59] I believe in the power of God.
[1:47:02] I believe in miracles, signs and
[1:47:04] wonders.
[1:47:07] Hallelujah. Amen. My Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:11] was rich in heaven. He became poor on
[1:47:14] the earth.
[1:47:16] So that I may be rich
[1:47:19] here on earth. There is no sin
[1:47:23] in being rich.
[1:47:26] Abraham was rich.
[1:47:28] Hallelujah.
[1:47:29] Amen. [screaming]
[1:47:30] David was rich.
[1:47:32] Joseph was rich.
[1:47:35] Amen.
[1:47:37] Yes, sir.
[1:47:37] He served God.
[1:47:41] God.
[1:47:42] Hallelujah.
[1:47:43] Amen. Job was rich. He lost many things.
[1:47:49] But when God restored
[1:47:52] many things, he added [screaming] more
[1:47:54] riches.
[1:47:58] [cheering] Amen.
[1:48:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you see that
[1:48:04] you can claim
[1:48:07] your blessings here on earth
[1:48:10] so long as you use them
[1:48:12] to serve the Lord? The motive should be
[1:48:16] right
[1:48:20] to serve the Lord. Now this morning it
[1:48:23] was raining
[1:48:25] and there are vehicles many vehicles in
[1:48:28] Campala
[1:48:31] and some are being driven by people are

[1:49:01] Amen.
[1:49:02] Hallelujah.
[1:49:03] Yes.

[1:49:08] church.
[1:49:12] Then some people now if I get a vehicle,
[1:49:14] what about your fuel?
[1:49:16] Provide fuel.
[1:49:25] Lord God, I need a job. I ask for a job.
[1:49:29] Yes. Ask for well paying job
[1:49:33] to enable you to serve the Lord.
[1:49:36] Yes. Ask him to prosper your business.
[1:49:41] God promised to make you a head, not a
[1:49:43] tail.
[1:49:46] To be above, not below.
[1:49:49] You read Deuteronomy 28.
[1:49:53] God promised to bless you.
[1:49:56] I believe the full gospel.
[1:50:00] Spiritual blessings.
[1:50:05] Spiritual blessings. I believe in them.
[1:50:09] Physical blessings. I believe in them.
[1:50:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:16] Do you hear that?
[1:50:19] If the Lord promised
[1:50:21] to bless me on earth, brother,
[1:50:25] I will not wait to reject it.
[1:50:28] I will claim it.

[1:51:52] my sister, don't be scared. The prophet
[1:51:56] says,
[1:51:57] some people
[1:51:59] don't want to pray so much and they say,
[1:52:03] some people say, Lord, I don't want to
[1:52:05] disturb you. I don't want to ask this.
[1:52:10] The prophet said,
[1:52:12] God want to be bothered.
[1:52:15] He wants you to ask. The Bible tells us
[1:52:19] asking plenty
[1:52:22] so that your job
[1:52:25] may be full.
[1:52:28] Amen. And the Bible says you don't have
[1:52:31] because you don't ask.
[1:52:34] And don't ask because you don't believe.
[1:52:39] You see all those are scriptures.
[1:52:44] So you ask God
[1:52:46] whatever you need. He either gives it to
[1:52:49] you tells you why he's not giving it to
[1:52:53] you.
[1:52:55] That's the prophet.
[1:52:58] That's the prophet.
[1:53:08] Hey
[1:53:13] Hallelujah.
[1:53:14] Don't Lord, if you ask me why he's your
[1:53:20] father, you are his son.
[1:53:22] The son gets from his father.
[1:53:24] [screaming]
[1:53:26] Ask whatever you wish.
[1:53:29] Hallelujah. [screaming] Amen. Shall be
[1:53:31] given unto you.
[1:53:33] Oh my brother, stand up on your feet.
[1:53:36] God bless you.

[2:47:14] and standing with
[2:47:17] we love you. We appreciate your family.
[2:47:20] I I want to say especially to young
[2:47:22] people that are here in this country
[2:47:25] and many that stream our services.
[2:47:28] [music] I want to tell you this.
[2:47:32] Thi this is and and this is a man of God
[2:47:38] that over the years
[2:47:42] as you heard his testimony
[2:47:44] when he believed the message
[2:47:47] he did not give himself half-hazardly.
[2:47:49] [music]
[2:47:51] He gave himself to the message.
[2:47:55] He even started a school
[2:47:58] and
[2:48:00] all the whole school
[2:48:04] whoever goes through his school
[2:48:06] they hear this message
[2:48:09] he would have said I don't want to mix
[2:48:10] business my business with my faith
[2:48:16] but he understood there is nothing else
[2:48:19] that matters
[2:48:21] than the word of God. How many do you
[2:48:23] have in your school every year, Pastor
[2:48:25] Jess?
[2:48:31] But how many do you have in your
[2:48:34] school? Over 500 people.
[2:48:40] Every year they baptize over 50.
[2:48:44] I want to say your reward in heaven is
[2:48:46] great.
[2:48:48] I love that. Amen. God bless you. And we
[2:48:53] really we have been so immensely blessed
[2:48:54] by the ministry of the word
[2:48:58] and uh we want to say that we identify
[2:49:00] oursel with you.
[2:49:03] Amen.
[2:49:05] Shall we now sing a [music] chorus as we
[2:49:07] give in our offering as the deacons will
[2:49:10] hope to
[2:49:12] offering.
[2:49:15] How many have been blessed again?
[2:49:19] All right. So So h All right. So, how
[2:49:21] many would love to bless the man of God?
[2:49:25] Look, look, it's not for him. It's for
[2:49:28] you.
[2:49:31] He has a school of over 500 students.
[2:49:35] He doesn't need your money.
[2:49:38] But if you want to tap a little
[2:49:39] blessing,
[2:49:42] you can take out of what God has given
[2:49:43] you and the man of God.
[2:49:46] We believe that here, don't we? So let
[2:49:48] let us let us sing a chorus
[2:49:52] as we uh we we give that offering and
[2:49:55] then we shall

[2:50:09] for your prayers

[2:55:07] Our kind heavenly father, Lord, as we
[2:55:09] dismiss this congregation morning,
[2:55:12] [music]
[2:55:14] We appreciate you for blessing us today
[2:55:18] and reminding us these very important
[2:55:20] things, Lord.
[2:55:23] That you died on the cross
[2:55:26] so that you might make it possible for
[2:55:27] us
[2:55:29] to attain all that was once ours.
[2:55:33] You did not just leave us an
[2:55:35] inheritance.
[2:55:38] We already had it.
[2:55:40] It was ours before the foundation of the
[2:55:42] world,
[2:55:45] but you came and paid for it
[2:55:47] that we might get it back.
[2:55:51] We were redeemed.
[2:55:53] We thank you, Father, for the ministry.
[2:55:58] Bless Pastor Jesse.
[2:56:00] bless his wife,
[2:56:03] for all his children and family,
[2:56:05] his ministry. Lord, as he has been a
[2:56:08] blessing to the body in this area,
[2:56:13] may you also be a blessing to him.
[2:56:17] Give him strength, Lord, in his body,
[2:56:20] Lord, in his spirit.
[2:56:22] Father, as a pastor and as a leader, he
[2:56:24] goes no doubt through, Lord.
[2:56:30] and together with his family and they
[2:56:33] need your grace. Lord,
[2:56:36] he has come and labored and strengthened
[2:56:37] us and encouraged us.
[2:56:40] May you also in turn bless him and
[2:56:42] encourage him.
[2:56:46] Strengthen him that whenever he stands,
[2:56:48] he will [music] continue to be a
[2:56:50] blessing to the poor.
[2:56:53] Father, we also ask your blessings upon
[2:56:56] the people that have given something,
[2:56:58] Lord,
[2:57:01] just a [music] love offering to our
[2:57:02] brother.
[2:57:04] I pray that you bless them and bless
[2:57:07] every one of us as we go.
[2:57:10] We are committing yourself into your
[2:57:12] [music] into your hands
[2:57:15] until we meet again
[2:57:18] the precious name of Jesus.
[2:57:21] Amen.
[2:57:22] Amen.
[2:57:25] [applause]
[2:57:27] So [music] before you go, uh I Pastor
[2:57:31] Pastor Chakon surprised me when he
[2:57:33] bumped into my house the other day.
[2:57:39] Unexpected. [music]
[2:57:41] So uh we had received these letters. You
[2:57:45] can have you can be seated. We had
[2:57:47] received these letters from the Mana
[2:57:50] meetings.
[2:57:54] So I didn't get had not gotten a chance
[2:57:55] to get the details.
[2:57:59] But in talking to him the other day
[2:58:02] he clarified that uh the meeting they
[2:58:05] will have a whole day meeting the first
[2:58:08] day will be from morning.
[2:58:13] I presume they are because I don't
[2:58:15] remember clearly but I think they'll be
[2:58:17] having two services every day
[2:58:21] in the morning and afternoon
[2:58:25] from 17th that is next Friday
[2:58:30] actually Friday [music] this week.
[2:58:34] So Friday this week they'll be having
[2:58:35] two services
[2:58:38] and uh Saturday they will be having two
[2:58:40] services as well.
[2:58:43] So and sand as well.
[2:58:45] So I think that anyone in this church
[2:58:49] who would like to participate in those
[2:58:51] meetings to go and be in fellowship with
[2:58:53] the believers there
[2:58:55] you're more than welcome to do that.
[2:59:00] So I think [music] we have two full days
[2:59:01] to participate in
[2:59:04] that is Friday and Saturday.
[2:59:07] [music]
[2:59:08] If you want to go and be there and be in
[2:59:10] all the services will be wonderful.
[2:59:14] So that means if you want to go Friday
[2:59:16] morning and afternoon, Saturday morning
[2:59:18] and afternoon, that's okay.
[2:59:23] But you are very busy at work and you
[2:59:24] just want to find a day and [music] then
[2:59:26] you go or a service find.
[2:59:33] So our Sunday service will not be
[2:59:35] interrupted here Sunday
[2:59:41] and then our Wednesday of course. So we
[2:59:43] shall be here again on Wednesday
[2:59:49] uh this week. [music]
[2:59:51] So the Lord bless you.
[2:59:53] And before I had just forgotten, I did
[2:59:55] not note it down here. On Wednesday, we
[2:59:57] also have a a visiting minister,
[3:00:02] a brother from Sweden.
[3:00:05] Uh I don't know him,
[3:00:09] but uh another minister in another
[3:00:12] country linked him up with us.
[3:00:17] That brother is coming here, I think,
[3:00:18] for some work.
[3:00:22] [music]
[3:00:22] But I learned he was a minister and I
[3:00:24] asked him and I invited him to come and
[3:00:26] minister to us that Wednesday.
[3:00:31] Praise the Lord.
[3:00:33] So don't miss Wednesday service.
[3:00:36] Be here on Wednesday [music]
[3:00:39] and be blessed again. So this is a
[3:00:42] season of blessings.
[3:00:45] The ones who missed Friday,
[3:00:48] I don't know whether you will ever have
[3:00:49] something like that again.
[3:00:52] It's always increasing, I know,
[3:00:55] but Friday was something else.
[3:00:58] So, don't miss services.
[3:01:01] Try and come as much as you can.
[3:01:04] So, the Lord bless you and go with you.
[3:01:08] [music] We'll meet on on on Wednesday.
