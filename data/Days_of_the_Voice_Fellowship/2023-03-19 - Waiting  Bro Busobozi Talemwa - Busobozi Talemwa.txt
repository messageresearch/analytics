========================================

that you wait upon the Lord I'm happy to see by the psalm God bless you and also brother Gideon God bless you thank you for coming and I'm happy to see every one of you these young men they've not been coming on Wednesday for some time but the day that we that we shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as egos they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint [Music] but even the youth shall faint sometimes we think you know when people are older sometimes they can lose balance and fall off and that's what happens the older ones the older you get the more vulnerable you are doing even they faint and even the youth be wary and even the younger men shall utterly fall nobody is meaning that to each of us whether you are old or young you are not sufficient in yourself you need an extra help wait you need God to give you strength and Grace sometimes we might be wary it is Spirit or in your soul or in your body and you need extra strength and you feel you need strength from the Lord so maybe you're faint foreign [Music] we will renew our strength as long as we wait upon the Lord we will always renew our strength so I'm speaking on waiting tell your neighbor waiting now there are many benefits of waiting foreign all right so all of you have stood in a line or in a queue and you waited for something my name is food someone was waiting for food and you know when you are hungry and you are standing in a queue you you can't pass the others that came before you even if you have ulcers and you you begin complaining around I have outside I'm actually feeling not well at all at least they should have let me pass if you try to pass somebody else will tell you please please and especially when here in Africa when someone has died many people who don't don't even have an association with the person who died they want to come and eat food [Music] and they are usually the first in the queue when even when they are last or in the middle somewhere they will try to sneak their way out of the queue so that they can be in the front because they don't want to wait [Music] in the bank more bank and maybe those tellers that really serve slowly slowly slowly 10 minutes 20 30. sometimes even one hour and you feel like fainting I remember when I was in Ethiopia my my wife I think we had about two children then and so we had Elizabeth and the ship I don't know where they're here so Elizabeth was very good at crying so when you would stand at um at the immigration queue immigration it was a very long queue but you know what I used to do yes I remember that time at that time my wife was pregnant for uh and Elizabeth was little also I carried her and I told my wife now we need to find our way to the front [Music] foreign Moroni so when when this man came he noticed my wife and then my child how my child rest how Restless my child was so the whole thing was a mess he told me he said please just go past so we passed to the front and and and at that moment I knew indeed waiting we were not going to wait no more praise the name of the Lord you know many people don't like waiting that many people are like me on that queue [Music] we have to make the baby crying we have to do everything it took to correct your nature thank you for us to go to the front and besides praying waiting is very hard for all of us many of us nobody likes waiting if you want something you want it immediately if you ask if you're a child and you ask your parents for money and you're going to school you want it there and then if you want a job you want it now foreign that was a person of substance nobody received what they wanted to receive there and events they waited and I'm going to take you down a journey tonight we will not be long as usual I consider myself not to be a very long preacher the network and so I trust that you will follow me along tonight foreign let us begin with a quote but the bottom says but it was done the Hebrew children but they never tempt the Lord thy God they was just thrown into it they didn't try to manufacture something and he says that's what's the matter with the Pentecostals today they are manufacturing something into they can't wait you see they are manufacturing something they can't wait and he says oh God they just can't wait so they commit adultery tell us to manufacture something never uses stairs and what does it bring forth like it did the first time the first bride that couldn't wait I will get deeper into foreign that is talking about Eve could not wait and because she could not wait she went into adultery again and then she was able to get bastard children and he says we all are a part of that okay I'll expound it as we go on but God came in the flesh but God Came In the Flesh to give us another birth at work God Came In the Flesh to bring us back to the original Sons and Daughters of God you see he says that um okay the lifespan of Eve never happened it never did why shimingo did kept it away instead of Adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like Christ's will would have come to the group Christ would have come to his church he promised to do it I mean did you get it no you see Adam Adam was the husband to this bride yes and he was supposed to give seeds you remember what God promised Adam in the beginning in Genesis what did God promise he told them multiply and remember by this time Adam and Eve was not flesh and blood how are they going to accomplish that because just the same way that God brought forth his children by the spoken word because the spoken word is the original scene but what happened while they waited [Music] because someone told me oh if that was the purpose why didn't they have children before [Music] but you see that had not yet been the appointed time but before the appointed time for that to be accomplished and the serpent gave a better options do you know that we all are born as bastard children [Music] because each of you has that part of serpentine [Music] the reason was you see so she did not bring the original Sons and Daughters of God [Music] bastard children but here he says but God Came In the Flesh to give us another bar at work to bring us back to the original Sons and Daughters of God [Music] hallelujah amen and that's why they said no matter how evil we are or how bad we are you see as a child of God you must never accept to defeat you must never accept to be of the world you must never accept your temptation to overwhelm yourself you must never accept yourself to be done because there is one that was born in order to give me and give you another foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] you see that's why we preached that's why there is preaching of the gospel because the preaching of the Gospel the preaching of the gospel songs free setting the captives free [Applause] that's what Jesus Christ has come to do actually he says that the spirit of the Lord God is upon me the purpose of Jesus Christ was on Earth so our soul that we are a victim of circumstances you see he made an unfailing way for those Souls that were in prison an unfailing way for them to be set free 30 minutes and how does it set them free by giving them a new bath by giving you a new back you may not someone may tell you against this message but we are the proof that what I'm telling you is the truth that God can still set Souls free do you believe you are one of those Souls that are set free praise the name of the Lord something is happening today with you know young people that wouldn't wait just a little bit all right so we see that some you know uh they end up you know because physically speaking now they end up they can't wait you know waiting for marriage waiting or you're waiting waiting or they can't wait so they end up in fornication and immorality but remember failing to wait like Eve's case has consequences foreign [Music] [Music] you are walking there with the Devil but when the consequences when the time for the consequences [Music] I'd like us to see an example here that did not wait turn with me to the book of First Samuel chapter 13. foreign let us begin from verse Five summary and the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel 30 000 chariots and six thousand Horsemen and people as the sandwiches on the seashore in multitude and they came up and preached in mismatch Eastward from Beethoven when the men of Israel saw that they were in a straight for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits our Versace and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of God and Gilead as for Saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling and so the Philistine Army had come to attack the Israelites and you remember how Saul was chosen as a man to lead Israel of course it was at a time that Israel wanted to have a man to rule over them is yet God was their King and so God told his Prophet don't worry they have not rejected you but they have rejected me but you remember last time we talked about how Saul was elected as a king he was God that elected him and chose him to be a king I will not go in the whole story but then he became the king of Israel but now here I want us to look at souls he finds himself in a straight in a place where he needs to exercise waiting let me tell you to each of us Believers to each of us Christians we must always come to that place where we must exercise waiting but the question is how are you going to behave are you going to stand your ground on the word of God okay oh you are going to try and and go and take the easy way out I want you to see the children of Israel were following Soul they were all fearful they were all trembling and then they went on up to gilgals and so the Bible verse 8 says and he tarried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but somewhere else came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of the offering of the offering the of offering the bad offering behold Samuel came and and Saul went out to meet him that he may salute him and some will say what has thou done and so said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and the thou cameest not within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together a at mismatch thereafter said I the Philistines will come down now upon me to gilgam and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself thereof and offered a bad offering foreign and verse 12 says therefore said I the Philistines will come down upon me to gilgalan I have not made supplications unto the Lord I forced myself to have an offered about offering and someone said thou has done foolishly thou has not kept the Commandment of the Lord like God which he commanded thee for now would they Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now the kingdom shall not continue the Lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord has commanded him to be Captain over the over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee somewhere then foreign the children of Israeli as I told you they were all shivering and shaking [Music] and they came following their kings and soul knew very well that he was the king but he was not the prophet he was the king not the prophet but as as he stood there in gilgals the prophet had told him to wait for seven days it was the work of a prophet to give or offer sacrifice [Music] amen and then we see that as as someone who tarried about somewhere I'm imagining the Bible says for seven days you see this is how children of God fight their battles you you must give an offering to them that's why we come in the church to praise him to cry for him to jump to do all these things to hear the water we are giving an offering to them and so as they were they were up in gilgals the prophet was looking I mean the King was looking around the prophet was not coming yeah okay just wait for the second character the second day the third day what was that what was the last day was the last appointed day okay of waiting the last day of waiting was the seventh day and you're not saving his completion so there was their waiting was going to be complete in seven is that right are you following me seven some the end of waiting so the the the king waited for six days and then when the seventh day arrived at your room he waited but as the day was about to end this prophet foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign I'm smiling because I'm waiting do that you're just moving I'm imagining this is how King Soul was he didn't even know where to swim let me give it myself that was a mistake did not wait and when they brought the offering the man gave it to himself maybe didn't even know how to cut it just bring that down big sword okay so the other thing pushing the fire and he was tying an apron on himself and then the prophet arrived the Bible says at the moment this King could not wait long enough and then the man of God was hungry when the prophet arrived because the king the prophet knew what the king did he was so previous to the Lord the prophet knew what the king did not know it wasn't just about the sacrifice it was also about the right anointed anointing for the office you see you may feel like you want to do something even better than your pastor sometimes but the question is I is that your right office you are more knowledgeable than your father or singer that I am against you are better than your mother you want to even do everything and devise everybody around oh yeah but is that your right office you always have to wait or you know and while waiting you submit to Authority and at that moment the king the prophet what have you done a king was but uh you see on my knee I saw the people were scattered and you were not coming in the days who are you to say if God wants you to wait wait [Music] foreign [Music] and now you're saying I forced myself he was impatient he didn't wait long enough and the king the prophet said someone said unto soul you have done foolishly you have not obeyed the command you have not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God and now the kingdom would have been with you forever but according to what you have done your kingdom shall not continue the Lord has sought him a man after his own hammock [Music] seven is a number of completions it might seem that summer was no longer coming to fulfill his place but it was foolish for Saul to stop waiting and where are we today we are in the seventh age we are in the last day we are the last day of waiting the very last time I seem as if Christ is not going to come Christian but he told us he is going to come back again we are not going to be like those who don't believe that paid we don't want to be impatient we don't want to live as though Jesus is not coming back we want to live as though we believe that on the last day on the last day of the seventh gentle generation there was the first age that was the second age that God was dealing with a gentle child foreign [Music] expecting Grace to abound don't allow the devil to preach to you that you will put it right tomorrow praise the name of the Lord whatever is wrong in your life whatever is wrong in our lives we should make it right right away and make ourselves ready all the time that if the Lord comes the next [Music] I tell you what some one of these days Jesus Christ is going to come in the air yes foreign [Music] [Music] is still coming but yeah wow that's just your stories but about Paul said then I would have you no Brethren one day to the Lord is a thousand years God doesn't count the way we count cartoon foreign [Music] we are saying one day just won the meal one one day let me live in sin for just one day 24 hours I'll start it tomorrow but to God it is you have sorted not started yourself for two thousand years one second academically come if one if 24 hours is 2000 years 24 hours is one thousand years how much is one second attack you can count it and see it's a really long time so how are you going to live your life Soul as soon as he offered the sacrifice foreign [Music] so we are here friends at the finishing line today let us not give up yet how I wish that somebody would have told Soul wait just a moment can you sing our way the man waited for seven days actually let me say for six days and 23 hours perhaps I can put it that way and that last two hours and that's when the prophet arrives the Bible says that the day of the Lord will be as a thief in the night two women will be on their sowing one will be taken once all around the world [Music] [Music] has it lost I remember we used to always live on our toys foreign [Music] [Music] so I quickly rushed to find out foreign oh where are you what's my first question say oh we are in conventions let me tell you this is how we ought to be always wanting to be near our brothers how can you be a believer your friends are those of the world you don't even contact with the Believers let me ask you are they the ones really that you're going to spend eternity with you because we will have overcome the world let me tell you our hearts should always be yearning for the coming of the lord we should always live under expectations yes we can go and have jobs yes we can go and take our families together design it we can take care of our families and do other things but let me tell you that is the primary thing for a Believer the coming of the Lord the preparation Hallelujah are you ready are you ready you want to take the phone and write a brother how are you my brother one of the reasons you are doing that I want to see are they still here then I say yes are you pressing on yes I'm pressing and they will ask you what about you you said me too I'm blessings hallelujah amen let me tell you foreign telephone number trying to call is not available this is they feel the burden and the fire to God preaching okay we should have gone but before we do that let us go and talk to the pastor and then when you go to the pasta you find there is no one is that forsaken house maybe the pastor has gone somewhere with his family let us go on Sunday at church you will find one or two people and the deacons will not be there the minutes and then those of you who find yourself you'll realize you have one thing in common come to think of it who are the others I don't know it's the money where are the others I don't know what happened and then one of you will think about before you tell the others before you even want to say foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign those who will not wait that are in this will be foolish for them foolish virgins while some of us have gone to glory and I tell you what I believe with all my heart I am one of those that will go [Music] Hallelujah if the devil doesn't believe it I say you can go to hell that's where he belongs but I know where I belong I belong in the Rapture I belong in the coming of the Lord so that he can give me a new birth in myself on fire for the coming of the Lord praise the name of the Lord so friends make friends with those that you will spend eternity check your phone list when you spend most time with it that's the one you will spend eternity [Music] wherever they are going is where you are going to remember what what you're talking with them is reflecting the place we are going to as simple as that it is reflecting now that's why the Bible says let us examine ourselves so we can see if we are in the face have you examined yourself are you in the faith you examine yourself are you going okay if you're not going I'm telling you don't leave this place today ask God to help you so you can be ready to go praise the name of the Lord and then the king told the prophet or the king this is even another one God has already prepared good is amazing when did God prepare him did he know that the king would do this God knows all things the next thing is the next thing waiting is for that elected and called out Seed of Abraham [Music] vocabulous [Music] who was recognized the manifestation of God among his people narinda yeah are you waiting I am waiting for the Chariots When the Saints Go March when the saints [Music] to my home do that fair City When the Saints Go March and then the prophet told him the king God has even prepared says that you see these people they did not wait and because they didn't wait they denominated God has given to us that he is coming foreign [Music] [Music] okay in in 20 minutes let me let me take you through this let us see first Samuel chapter 13 verse 14 but now the kingdom shall not continue here is when God is choosing David now the kingdom shall not continue the Lord has sought him and a man after his own heart and the Lord has commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee on your recommendation so here was God choosing David foreign at this time we're talking about I ask you a question where was David yes yes he was a Shepherd somewhere in a bush he didn't know what God was planning but he was waiting so David really started waiting before he even knew the plan of God for his life brother you may tell me yes I don't know what I should wait for what what God intends for my life I don't know the plan of God just wait my name is [Music] to be two years from now but wait upon the Lord David was waiting even when he did not know you are in a better place than David tonight because I have told you David no one told him David was just waiting yeah yeah way way [Music] upon the Lord and then came a time when the time of waiting was almost over um three chapters later in 1612. and he sent and brought him in now he was Rudy and width of a beautiful continents and goodly to look too and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so someone rose up and went to ramam but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him and sold servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from God trouble with thee now I want you to see something here at this time of course we know the story how someone went to Jesse's house and when he arrived in Jesse's house he was supposed to anoint a king there yeah I want to ask you another question did he know who the king was he said this the same man that spoke to Saul and he said God has chosen another man so did he eat another man he was making my inspiration that's why you should always be careful when the word of God goes through the the minister because sometimes God is designing speaking your heart without even the money himself knowing what he's talking about sometimes I may say a few statements it's about your life you know it's about your life but I don't know anything about even what I'm saying so yeah Saul was telling King someone was telling King Saul that God has the kingdom will no longer continue with you God has chosen himself but even so did not know who is [Music] [Applause] and go in the house and right there he he followed the leadership of God it took him there what did he have to do friends he had to wait but like many of us sometimes waiting is he was anointed he was a man of God he was inspired but what did he have to do at that moment foreign [Music] Oh e r e r e e someone was surprised but the problem was he never waited he saw another one and God said no it is [Music] then again you saw another one because said to me who are those little preachers for tomorrow send them over here all right come come laying up here how many times did you just have yes huh brother some will come come on come on and fill the whole place just as children you see how all of them how good they are told us went to the next one can you imagine but he didn't wait and then all of a sudden God had somebody there is the name of the Lord God had somebody that he had kept somewhere we are nobody knew a foreign and then he said ah this is Jesus house do you have another one he said another one the other one is not even I didn't even count here he is just a rude foreign [Music] foreign [Music] the man of God was shocked but he had no objections he had to bring the horn and anointed Hallelujah man if the prophet somewhere had waited he would not have made all these spiritual guesses we have a lot of prophets today making spiritual guesses ah elujah [Music] God is God is telling me there is someone there one woman foreign [Music] then he collects himself is the one that has been having headaches two of them say yeah [Music] we are not married yet you go back I'm telling you those spiritual guesses why are they mad because men don't wait here was a man of God a spiritual man of God but when here David that would be God chose him and when God chose I will not read Because of time God anointed him after and the moment God anointed him the Bible says the spirit of God Came Upon David and the spirit of God and an evil spirit how I don't know but that's what the Bible says Saul was a troubled soul but that was for a purpose there are certain things that God permits to happen so that his purpose can be accomplished in some people's lives Soul had to have this evil spirit movie so that David can become relevant I wondered Hallelujah and when David was anointed he still was like a number the evil spirit came to sorrow and then there was a need for somebody who had the spirit now the Bible says the spirit of the evil spirit um we know that bad attitude that's why I always tell people sometimes the people who have bad attitude [Music] it's an evil who knows how to play Hallelujah who knows how to play music Spirit-filled voice and I tell you what they looked everywhere you know the answer they gave him they told him there is one little boy his name is the evil spirit in my soul called for the spirit of God in David that was not a coincidence some people are tormented in this Earth so that it can call for what is in you to give them a solution hallelujah amen let me tell you whenever I walk in this world I don't know I don't believe it is a condition I believe it is how it is supposed to be secretary I always see myself as a little David you should see yourself as a little David where is I can cast it out how are you going to cast it out by the spirit of God that is in you will meet people that are depressed you will meet me foreign [Music] foreign and David found himself in the palace singing singing in moments [Music] [Music] that's a normal voice but just a stringed one woman and at that moment that moment there is something in this go and tell his father I want this young man to be here this is his place from today he is going to be my amateur again because this was waiting upon amen glory to God remember David knew together but it didn't boasts that he was anointed whenever he would sing for songs he will see that throne and he will know it is Hallelujah the anointing I wonder which song do you think he sang during that moment [Applause] is taking back Linda all the anointing all the singers foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Applause] things began to go up and down vibrations of the power of the Holy Spirit then he just it was just filled with that anointing and he asked the question who is this uncircumcised the Philistines that can defy the kingdoms the armies of the of the living the army of Israel Israel who is he tell me the boy how many spoke in a voice bigger than him he said give him to me I will show him we know you were anointed but at least wait until you grow these little brothers I think they might have got his e and squeezed wait until you go this way I mean what I said Brethren yeah who is he and you you give him to me let me give you my testimony one day to kill myself it was again foreign said okay let me give you my jacket so that you can go okay so that you can go and attack and when you wear it he said this is not my size I don't want this theology I don't want these things I want to go with only one thing Jesus yes only one thing the revealed one of the earth and when he went again he killed that man but let me tell you one thing I didn't tell you David said they asked the question the first question the very first question they asked is the man who will kill this guy what will he get but then and they told him the key is going to give him one of his daughters foreign foreign [Music] Linda throughout the whole time David waited David feeding ship he was waiting David killing the bear and the lion he was away when he was anointed David when he received favor before the king and the kingdom now it is Goliath and he became the champion tell me what did he do he was one let me kill him he was tempted but he didn't kill him what did he do she waited yeah for God this time David waited and waited and waited to the moment when Jonathan and Saul were killed in battle you understand foreign to be around some a man or a woman of God who is waiting to be around such people you have to be very careful you can lose your life you will not be blessed took David nearly 15 years from the time he was anointed some of you here are going to be millionaires each step of the way some of you are going to get married you have to wait you don't have to rush don't rush things go through you want to just get it immediately people want to be rich overnight you can't do that because God has has given you a secret that you are going to be a pastor if God revealed one of you Brothers here that you are going to be the next pastor of this church what are you going to do will I even sleep instrumentality to it the worry that you thought you pull here you pull that you push here let God do things from the time David was anointed you did not influence anything big or small for him to sit on that throne God did everything God literally dragged him on that Throne is [Music] that's not how it is you say I must get a job he must be um all that is good it's called job hunting it's not job hunting that gives you a job it is faith and walking into the dogs and walking into the door that God is David did not push go on your knees ask God for leadership oh where is it gave a testament the other times and he got up I don't know what I said Hallelujah and then finally it was projector light project the first time it might have been the second time it might not have been happening but what am I saying teaching number when even when you come at the altar don't rush to go back wait on God remember in the convention we had some people here almost by the way in every service we had someone receive the power of God foreign and and one one young lady were worshiping and she was just all over she was just rolling on the floor and some people wanted to carry her out I didn't even I didn't I was not aware of what was happening but the spirit of God just carried me I found myself it was by inspiration and that sister I thought that I think they thought she was going to confuse everything but she did not she was waiting in that atmosphere and that's the right thing to do it someone you feel like crying to the Lord and you don't even wait for an article to be called you just come on the Altar and bro you pray wait on God you see you come before the service begins [Music] is actually more and takes longer time than actually the real thing and when you wait you can never be disappointed God bless you sir way that way upon the Lord shall renew their strength place your mind on top you want to stand up on your feet as an eagle they surround trying to not be weary they shall walk teach me Lord Teach Me Love it everybody sister by faith comes for prayer they that wait upon
