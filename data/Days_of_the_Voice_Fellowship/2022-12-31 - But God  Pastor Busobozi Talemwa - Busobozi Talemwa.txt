the crop of Praise [Music] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus yes praise the name of the Lord while you are still standing we shall take a scripture in the book of Ephesians chapter 2. I'd like to while you're opening your Bibles to thank the Lord for the grace he has given us to be able to speak to you in this conventions we want to thank God for Pastor Joseph and Tai for the invitation message and also for the confidence and you know invite us to come and speak to you it's very humbling especially when you have generous and there are others have had to say that these are generous but when they themselves are generous but to me when I said generals I really mean it because I'm a junior but we want to thank God for the generals let us thank God for the generation without them we all would not have been here today I mean whenever I look I see men of God I want to really respect you and say God bless you for allowing us to speak to you and your people amen I mean I was speaking to one of the brothers on the organizing committee DC and I think the assistant pastor Joseph and he asked me a question now he is the organizing committee [Music] how come that you're speaking the last service [Music] how did that happen how did you take that honor to do this I told him I do not know how come I even get to speak so he doesn't know so Pastor Leo said something he said it it's it's God who led past untai to ask whoever was to stand here in this convention oh so I believe that God knew our needs is indeed our needs are made I've been moved in this last service I want to say God bless you brothers and the other ministers I was I was charges participated in these meetings we closed our service on Sunday so we've been here amen I mean let us go to the scripture and then we shall read and see it um let us begin instead of verse 2. let us begin from verse one is [Music] [Music] foreign who were dead in trespasses and sins were in in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all hear in this confession had our conversation in time past in the last of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we are by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but I wanted to hear verse 4. it says and then there is a comma there so we should read this and pause a moment I wonder you each of us could say those two words who is rich in Mercy for his great love we are with he loved us even when we were dead [Music] and we know that one of these days we will no longer be here because we will be gone it's a privilege and I want to thank you for your grace now to you in Jesus name amenities but God that's the subject I have in my mind thank you brother for singing that song for us massage you know we've been in this convention and we have had a lot of teachings a lot of exhortations a lot of preachings and I believe we are full I don't think that we need more but I think what we need we need tonight is to think about what God has done for us in this house and so there are many uh preachers that have preached wonderful summons and you know last night there was a healing service and you see I had something uh in my my heart and what I wanted to see what I was laboring in my heart to see but I want to say in this in the past Services we didn't come just to talk about the message to be in us and for us to be in nothing in Christ so the service I don't think I'll be wrong I do not know I was money but this is the last service after now you are going home but if I were not to dakas I want you to you know uh pay attention now for a few moments [Music] and see the Bible says and you has it quickened him who are dead interest is not somebody who is a murderer somebody who is a thief or somebody who is an adulterer I realize that all of us were upon Cena the Bible says we all have sinned and all have come short of the glory of God like I said in the other service we have seen as because we were born you were seen us because we were born of a woman the Bible says [Music] [Music] the Bible says he is the savior he is the Redeemer you remember the three the three uh Hebrews children you know the prophet says as they walked into the fiery furnace you know all the Angels they wanted to go down they had waited upon the Lord they asked one another message and they say to themselves and to others we know that our God is able to save us but even if he does not serve us he will walk through the fire I want to tell you here today is able to take us out of it every situation but even if he did not do it Hallelujah we know he's more than able to do it we know that we will go through the fire anyhow praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord as they walked through the fire I'm sure all the Angels were on there on their toys [Music] let me go and cause you know I can do it you created me to do that let me go and save your son cartoon [Music] I want you to see something here you are dead as long as you are not yet believe the message you were just dead you did not know it but you were dead until you know what Christ has done for you on the cross you were a day but there are many groups and many denominations that talk about the cross but I'm convinced they do not know what the cross is because the cross it is the blood that has reconciled us back to God besides and our ministry is the ministry of reconciliation reconciling human beings the Bible now continues to say is the word of reconciliation we don't have the blood of Jesus today the blood of Jesus sacris in every generation is embedded in the word of that power was the blood of that Tower the message of wisely was the blood of the tower was the blood of that Tower the message of William Branham is the blood of this hour because the message is not an idea of a man the message is the mind of Jesus Christ and the Bible says we were dead in our unbelief so now sin is unbelief we are in the message on the message of the hour when you refuse to be foreign how many believers do I have here now we all have believed now we can read the scripture and say the Bible says and you as he quickened Musa who were dead this is now past tense hallelujah amen in time past we walked away according to the prince according to the course of this world we were anglicans we were Muslims how many anglicans were here lift up your hands how many Catholics you are dead in that moment how many Adventures those how many Muslims we're Muslims how many Jehovah Witnesses yes right there um there are many lodges that we were in warri [Music] hallelujah amen who is Rich he loved us yes [Music] all the other purpose for his brothers and the purpose of God is never can stop it no amount of demons because the purpose of God cannot be defeated in the church when you come and another person says that if you really yield yourself to God I will say so much that refused you with the Holy Ghost you will be a thunder to the devil that the devil will not know what to do the devil doesn't know what to do with the end time messages and now you will sing Against the things I used to do I do them no more hallelujah hallelujah and he continues on to say we're in in time past you walked according to the course of this world and he says according to the priests of the power of the Earth the spirit that now works in the children of the Disobedience God never takes anyone to Hell actually the purpose of God is not to take any human being to him again hell was created for foreign foreign foreign foreign so we all had our conversations in time passing the lusts of our flesh [Music] in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh do you know you don't have to fulfill those desires did you know you don't have to overdose but if the devil gets to convinced you you cut you cannot do otherwise then you always fulfill them we were like all the others the children of Wrath there's some people who say you know I was born this way I love a tea I was born a liar in our family we are all lions in our car in in our family tree it was famous my father was not a surprise for me to be one cuttings my father was lost [Music] even the great grandfather so brother please try to understand this is my nature you know in our family even I know I took after my father when my father is angered he can even remove your eyes but this is the Bible actually agrees with you he says by Nature now the thing is in You by a nature your Fallen nature you have another nature another nature which is not from there another nature which is from the heavens the nature of Jesus Christ communication goes away foreign foreign [Music] even many here tonight one time you can look back and know that you were dead when you were going to that mosque you are going to those lodges the religious Lodges of course when you were in living in sins foreign [Applause] that made the change right there God who is Rich it is not me it's not my riches not you to stop your desires you don't have to do it by yourself my sister don't try to be a hypocrite we have many hypocrises foreign I have nothing against them sit in a chamber what can I have good news for you Hallelujah I mean you don't have to remain a scene because you are trying to manufacture right yes you cannot make it who is richer foreign if he was rich in money if he was just rich in materials which he is God is rich [Music] no believers God is rich in money he is rich in what we need is he [Applause] I I met a sister an all-time sister and she told me she said oh brother you're driving a good car said oh I wish you were in our day you will not drive this thing because you would be termed as proud and a sinner so it comes to a point even when a brother has the money because you want to be humble but that's all right but even the one who was them and uses them for the glory of God foreign foreign foreign when you begin talking about money away those things but we are in the world now if you don't hear it from the pulpits of the message now he says he is rich in those things Hallelujah and he says oh what a great word that is I always tell the people they don't come around to and the other time I talked to you of a sister I talked to you of assistance you know who used to come to church in trousers and my wife told me you left that door open because I never concluded right now we're talking about she's a real saint Musa [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and he says here in the same message and we were speaking the other night on how the seed Must Die Hungarian and everything around that jam of Life must not only die if he doesn't rotita food it cannot live she is you might not realize it but whenever you come to church and you sit down there amen and the pastor preachers and it seems as if he's just you know beating against them and it is [Music] something is happening yeah we may not see ourselves transforming please so let me tell you we are being transformed hallelujah amen the more we hear the world we need the Temple of the lord we shall be like him and until we get to the place that our own ideas foreign foreign foreign [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah even when others are so happy in their sins and you can't find places foreign Jesus yes you read Isaiah 61 yes one and two versions because that was not for his time and he said to them this day is the scripture fulfilled so when I read that scripture again [Music] those two words [Music] there's a sister who come firstly here one woman child are you today I want to tell your sister you might have gone again I have seen your way to Hell he's the only game changer you lay a catch you say is the only difference maker not he and somebody and your boss and he comes in the form of the world he comes in the form of the Holy Ghost and he says the only way that they could get that water out of that rock the Judgment Road can go to judgments the people he says God was just [Music] while I'm reading about the Jews I see myself even Moses called them Rebels against God and they deserved to die tell your neighbor and all of us deserve that anything because we are rebellious now I know we want to always to make it look like we are all powerful perfect and righteous but how many of you here have sinned here I'm talking about the mistakes you make one of the wrong things you do oh from time and time and this time you come for prayers foreign you should never thought or he should never not have ever thought of us until he took every Heely took the sins of every one of us we are drinking from that rock we must be right in our house foreign foreign [Music] foreign why didn't he not let that happen because he knew what he was a rib and a part of him and only he can save her yeah amen Christ who is the husband Oman is the Redeemer of the church and because Adam knew that he decided but that was not allow he also knew he had a redeem foreign but if you let Eve now yes be dead forever but if if Adam is a part of if sin the Redeemer came down so when when Jesus Christ came down Hallelujah for the revelation of the seals died on the cross and he said it is I believe we Believers of the message has come to the realization and we have a message demands from the devil everything he has stolen from the church we must not settle for less you know many people said only for the understanding of the world but we must not set only for the world we must also go on to receive the holy ghosts and these people the Jews they deserve to die praise the name of the Lord and the prophet says to be an ego of God to follow the words [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] all right now here is what Mercy does we are facing this direction and so these brothers are meant to go but in again to hell okay yeah that's the plan and purpose of the Devils but before the foundation of the world he believed in eternal security sandwich and so Kathy they are supposed to go but in again and they are supposed to go but in a game but whenever they reach that place no you can't go keep fighting they'll keep fighting fight away not to fight away but the master kept on saying no no I am not going to let you know again I am not going to let you slip away you cannot go to hell amen because I bought you with a prize foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] I will me give them to them that you will overcome sit with me I'll give them to each of the tree of life because he's sure he's confident I know they are Overcomers today [Music] [Applause] my brothers are you dedicated his message to the older ones I want to dedicate mine to the younger ones to overcome users we don't have the lucky story of living in sin another kid is we don't have that Samson wanted to die he really wanted to die please [Music] foreign and then the light I would say foreign and again not them when they went back to the left side do you know I love you and Samson was beginning to mail to me I hear you say anything and by that time his eyes and finally foreign [Music] that's why the prophet says anything might be possible as a matter of fact when it came to interracial marriage but why would a black girl a dark-skinned girl or a colored girl want to marry a white boy are you hearing that's what the prophet said why watching to give birth to a lot of children meaning foreign but he didn't give an expression what they are what you guys I'm simply saying what the prophet says but when it came to be mixing marriages with unbeliever name what about pasta is I would say yes that's a circumstance foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] go and suit yourself God is with me God promise foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] but God gives message God he gives Mercy for your soul God give his Mercy for your life God gave Mercy to Raha God gave Mercy to the thief on the cross that last moment [Music] and when the thief woke up he was in
