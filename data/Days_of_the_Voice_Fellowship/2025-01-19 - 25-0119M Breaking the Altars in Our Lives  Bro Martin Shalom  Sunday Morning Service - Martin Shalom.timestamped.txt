[1:39:07] the scripture we have
[1:39:11] read and I call it uh from this
[1:39:18] verse verse 7 where he say that and he
[1:39:21] and when he had br Bren down the altars
[1:39:25] and the Groves and had beaten the graven
[1:39:29] images into the powder and cut them and

[1:39:34] the land of Israel and he returned to
[1:39:37] Jerusalem
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:54] blessed be the name of the
[1:39:56] Lord
[1:39:58] amen I'll call my sharing this
[1:40:02] morning tearing down the
[1:40:07] altars or breaking down the altars in
[1:40:10] our
[1:40:13] lives blessed be the name of
[1:40:16] the amen you know an
[1:40:21] idol uh the the definition for an
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:26] idol here say that an idol or an idol or
[1:40:36] image okay an ID is
[1:40:41] image or representation of a
[1:40:47] god used as an object of worship
[1:41:01] blessed be the name of the
[1:41:03] Lord but remember the Bible
[1:41:05] says that God does not share his worship
[1:41:11] with blessed be the name of the Lord as
[1:41:14] we are moving we are going to see the
[1:41:17] some of these
[1:41:18] things there are some things in our
[1:41:21] lives which maybe you never
[1:41:24] know it has been an idol to
[1:41:27] you without even you
[1:41:30] knowing blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:41:32] and when we go back to this
[1:41:34] scripture we are seeing
[1:41:37] Josiah blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:41:40] Josiah was the grandson of
[1:41:43] mani and if you read second
[1:41:46] chronicles you see how these Kings
[1:41:50] behave how they reign and how they Deed
[1:41:54] from
[1:41:56] God and what followed after
[1:41:59] that blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:42:02] there is something special about
[1:42:05] Josiah praise be to God because if you
[1:42:09] come back up
[1:42:11] here when man
[1:42:14] died and then his son inherited
[1:42:18] him blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:42:21] his son was called Ammon
[1:42:24] and the Bible says in 2 Chronicles
[1:42:28] 33 ver 21 that Ammon was 2 and 20 years
[1:42:36] old when he began to Reign and Reign two
[1:42:39] years in
[1:42:42] Jerusalem but but he did that which was
[1:42:46] evil in the sight of the
[1:42:48] [Music]
[1:42:51] Lord his father
[1:42:54] for am sacrific all the covered
[1:43:00] images which man his father and had made
[1:43:03] and served
[1:43:06] them and humbled not himself before the
[1:43:12] Lord man his
[1:43:14] father and humbled
[1:43:17] himself but Ammon trespassed more and
[1:43:20] more
[1:43:25] blessed be the name of the Lord you
[1:43:28] remember in
[1:43:30] Kings that when
[1:43:32] Israel sinned against
[1:43:35] God God gave them in the hands of their
[1:43:38] enemies and each time God gave them the
[1:43:40] house of the
[1:43:42] en they knew where the problem
[1:43:45] was and go back to God and repent of
[1:43:49] their
[1:43:50] sins amen and again received
[1:43:54] them blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:43:57] there God sent them
[1:43:59] judges they sinned
[1:44:01] again and then they repent again and
[1:44:05] then God delivers
[1:44:06] them blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:44:10] here where we have just
[1:44:11] read we are seeing jah's
[1:44:15] father was an ID
[1:44:19] worshiper because his
[1:44:21] grandfather was also an idol
[1:44:24] worshiper but if you read the story of
[1:44:28] man man when he sinned against
[1:44:31] God and God gave them to gave him up the
[1:44:34] hands of his
[1:44:36] enemies and he was taken in
[1:44:39] C he cried to God he
[1:44:43] repented and God remembered
[1:44:46] them amen and after he died his son
[1:44:51] picked the man from
[1:44:55] and he did exactly like his
[1:44:58] father blessed be the name of the
[1:45:01] Lord amen there is something that I want
[1:45:04] to show you this
[1:45:05] morning it's not a
[1:45:08] must that you have to live like your
[1:45:11] parents you have to live like your

[1:45:39] years in
[1:45:42] Jerusalem 1 and3 years and he did that
[1:45:46] which was right in the sight of the
[1:45:53] never did like his
[1:45:56] father like his
[1:45:58] grandfather and walked in the ways of
[1:46:04] David father and decline neither to the
[1:46:09] right hand not the
[1:46:12] left for in the E year of his
[1:46:16] Reign while he was yet
[1:46:19] young he began to seek after God
[1:46:27] blessed be the name of the it is always
[1:46:30] good to see God when you are
[1:46:34] young amen he never went the ways of his
[1:46:39] father but he started to see God at his
[1:46:41] early
[1:46:44] AG blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:46:47] hallelujah hallelujah praise be to God
[1:46:51] Josiah started to seek
[1:46:55] God he did not walk in the ways of his
[1:47:00] grandfather and the Bible says he did

[1:47:09] young men and
[1:47:11] women that you are going to seek
