but one but one mighter than i cometh the latchette of whose shoes i'm not worthy to and lose he shall baptize you with a holy ghost and with the fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly pudge his flow and will gather the wheat into the gunner by the shaft he will bond with fire unquenchable a giant [Music] and speak through i i want to talk what i'm going to share tonight is where he says that john answered saying unto them all indeed baptized sea with water but one mightier than one mightier than i cometh the last of whose shoes i'm not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with a holy ghost and fire. a giant speaking about jesus away with you your job he shall baptize you are you about jesus with the fire no more blessing the name of the lord amen meaning so when jesus comes yes jesus baptized us with fire trophies are normal you know and that's why we are singing in acts 19 when apostle paul met the disciples of jesus christ [Music] [Applause] so john was preparing for the coming of the lord that was his first coming he was toiling he was preaching and baptizing god after he went to the wilderness [Applause] the second coming of jesus christ that's why i called her to send elijah to the community with the same spirit of preparation amen taking us back to original the one who's coming i'm not even bothered to lose his shoes but he has a secret woman when he comes up he will not baptize the only water how do you know [Applause] [Applause] [Music] amen amen i mean so god is preparing the church john was preparing the first church for the coming of the messiah in the amen because there was some great one who was coming when jesus comes yes sir there must be something what do you know about it you must do something for him to come into your life you must prepare your soul [Music] sir [Music] [Applause] telling them when [Applause] something about the fire of the holy ghost [Applause] [Applause] remember there must be a preparation before you are
