[40:10] uh this was our second trip into
[40:12] ethiopia
[40:13] again
[40:15] against them ethiopia and i usually
[40:18] write those emails whenever i go out hey
[40:20] everybody
[40:22] company
[40:48] paul and i travel to the city of
[40:50] nazareth on saturday evening
[40:58] we had one question in our mind
[41:02] could something good
[41:04] could something good really come out of
[41:06] nazareth
[41:11] now i will suppose a bit and remind you
[41:14] to those who do not remember
[41:44] and we were ministering to a group of
[41:46] young people
[41:53] [Music]
[41:59] who was one of the first believers
[42:04] and so sister
[42:07] she tried to tell us a few universities
[42:09] that she knew of in the country
[42:13] university
[42:14] area
[42:18] [Music]
[42:27] and so
[42:28] i i i nothing clicked in my heart as she
[42:32] was mentioning the names of this
[42:33] universe
[42:38] but then she mentioned one university
[42:41] university emoji are
[43:10] what does a dharma mean
[43:14] uh she said
[43:16] uh it means nazareth
[43:19] i told her we are going
[43:21] back
[43:23] today
[43:24] that same
[44:35] of nazareth
[44:39] we went to a university called adama
[44:42] university
[44:43] university
[44:45] but we were not allowed to enter the
[44:47] campus because there was a political
[44:49] situation that because of the political
[44:51] situation that was in the area
[44:54] university
[44:55] yeah
[44:58] we met and witnessed to a few people but
[45:01] it wasn't long until we had to switch to
[45:04] the nights
[45:06] until we had to switch to the night of
[45:08] rest
[45:14] at night
[45:16] i
[45:31] the lord was trying to plan things
[45:34] i could take a cable and i did not even
[45:36] have an idea
[45:39] so i narrated a dream to my brethren
[45:45] so we went on to the streets on sunday
[45:47] morning
[45:50] and sister yoda suggested we sit around
[45:53] a certain coffee place
[45:58] i want to have a new
[46:00] to meet and interact with the students
[46:03] since the restaurant was just closed by
[46:06] the campus grounds
[46:07] was closed by the country to the campus
[46:18] so i continue to write the story
[46:21] is very long
[46:23] but the little i can testify next gonna
[46:26] change that julia because we really had
[46:28] a wonderful time with nursing to the
[46:30] fresh fish from the waters of adama
[46:32] university
[46:36] area
[46:56] a young man 21 years old was baptized in
[46:59] the name of the lord jesus
[47:04] christ brother baby got a very good
[47:07] revelation of the word
[47:19] now there are many things i told like i
[47:21] wrote in this email i said that the
[47:22] story is very long
[47:27] but
[47:28] you know i realized when the apostles
[47:31] wrote the episodes are the two men with
[47:33] that one they come about work they did
[47:35] not write every little detail they
[47:37] wanted
[47:42] that happened
[47:45] so as i read this i realized oh there is
[48:03] after i had answered by the word
[48:08] he told me can you wait for me
[48:11] for just uh like 30 minutes
[48:13] can you wait here
[48:16] so you rushed to the university
[48:45] hallelujah

[1:23:13] of the beloved firstborn before the son
[1:23:16] of the hated
[1:23:18] move
[1:23:26] you need to read that out of your bible
[1:23:28] because that was not a correct
[1:23:29] translation
[1:23:31] i'll read verse 16 again then it shall
[1:23:33] be when he maketh his sons to inherit
[1:23:35] that which he has that he may not make
[1:23:37] the first the son of the beloved

[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:29] but he shall acknowledge the son of the
[1:24:30] hated of for the first born by giving
[1:24:33] him a double portion of all that he has
[1:24:36] for he is the beginning of his strength
[1:24:38] and the right of his and the right of
[1:24:40] the first born is his
[1:25:03] hallelujah now i know we will go a bit
