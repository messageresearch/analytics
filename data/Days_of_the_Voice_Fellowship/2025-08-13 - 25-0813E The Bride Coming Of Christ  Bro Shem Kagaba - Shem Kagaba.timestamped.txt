[36:47] myself unto thee.
[36:50] Dear heaven father, I've written some
[36:52] notes.
[36:54] I've listened to the message I've read
[36:56] here and there,
[36:59] but Lord, may you come and take full
[37:01] control.
[37:02] [Music]
[37:04] and may be blessed this evening
[37:08] in Jesus name I pray.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:16] God bless you musicians.
[37:20] Maybe if you can first have a seat.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:29] Once again, I'm happy to be in front of
[37:31] you
[37:35] and I thank God has protected each one
[37:36] of us
[37:40] and
[37:43] believing that the Lord will speak to
[37:46] us.
[37:50] Hallelujah.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; So our pastor is not with us.
[37:58] you receive greetings from him.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; I talked with him in the morning
[38:10] &gt;&gt; and God willing he will be coming back
[38:12] this weekend.
[38:16] Amen.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Also, uh
[38:21] our sister Shama, I know she will stream
[38:24] this
[38:28] in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia. May God
[38:32] bless you. You know, she's the sister I
[38:34] told you last time. She believed the
[38:36] message
[38:39] and may continue praying for her
[38:44] with her friends as well.
[38:47] This message is precious.
[38:50] Praise the Lord.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Whenever we come in the presence of God,
[38:56] should always feel excited when we are
[38:58] sharing.
[39:01] So today I'm going to speak about the
[39:03] bride coming of Christ.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. That statement, brother Brham
[39:17] used it many times,
[39:21] but it really means the Christ coming in
[39:23] the formation of the bride.
[39:29] Meaning that meaning that the formation
[39:38] meaning that this time around his second
[39:42] coming
[39:45] uh he's not coming as
[39:49] as one person as coming
[39:53] but he's coming in his body
[39:58] many membered body
[40:03] so I believe that uh God is the one that
[40:06] gave me this inspiration
[40:10] and to those of this is going to
[40:13] part three
[40:17] because we have shared about it two
[40:18] times.
[40:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; I had other things that I wanted to
[40:24] share about but when I prayed you know
[40:27] it's not easy to get some things to talk
[40:29] about here
[40:33] and then I felt God is leading me here.
[40:38] So
[40:40] let's first before we read the scripture
[40:45] the first coming of the Lord
[40:49] he was laying a foundation
[40:53] or we can say a pattern a pattern
[40:59] and it will be the same because he's the
[41:01] same yesterday and forever
[41:04] it does not change it's the same even in
[41:06] his second
[41:10] the way he came
[41:13] is the same way that he's coming.
[41:17] And uh I want you to know that his
[41:20] coming
[41:22] is the same as his going.
[41:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; When we talk about the coming of the
[41:29] second coming of Jesus Christ,
[41:33] we are meaning the going
[41:36] the rapture.
[41:38] Hallelujah.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; So that's why I titled this the coming
[41:43] meaning the going I mean the rapture.
[41:50] So and when you look at his coming
[41:53] if you want to understand the second
[41:55] coming
[41:58] because of course you have to understand
[42:02] if you are not to miss the second
[42:04] coming.
[42:08] And that's why the prophet says that
[42:11] the bride she is perfect
[42:17] because Eve fell in the garden of Eden.
[42:22] And again when Jesus Christ came and
[42:23] restored everything
[42:28] when the disciples slept again she fell.
[42:34] But now the third time the prophet is
[42:36] saying now this is the perfect time.
[42:40] He say that she is not going to fail.
[42:46] And one of the things that will make us
[42:47] not fail.
[42:50] is because that Paul says
[42:53] all these things were written for
[42:56] for our example
[43:02] admonition.
[43:04] Hallelujah. So for us we have where we
[43:06] can look and read and see
[43:11] the first coming of Jesus Christ.
[43:14] But those people could not see.
[43:19] Of course they had but for us we are
[43:22] better. We have we have the fullness.
[43:28] Hallelujah. So to understand his second
[43:29] coming
[43:32] we have to look at his first coming how
[43:34] it was.
[43:39] All the conditions that were surrounding
[43:41] his first coming,
[43:45] they are the same condition in the
[43:46] second coming.
[43:49] But look, only one thing is going to
[43:51] change.
[43:53] It is our response to those conditions.
[43:59] It is our response to those conditions.
[44:03] Hallelujah.
[44:05] That is what that is going to make a
[44:07] difference.
[44:09] So there are quite many things around
[44:11] his surrounding his coming
[44:13] [Music]
[44:15] but I'm going to pick just a few things.
[44:18] I also if I'm to ask a question
[44:23] when was his first coming?
[44:27] Can you pinpoint and tell that this is
[44:29] his coming?
[44:33] Is it when the angel went to Mary?
[44:38] Is it when he was born in a manger?
[44:44] Is it when he went in the temple? This
[44:46] day this scripture is fulfilled.
[44:48] [Music]
[44:51] Is it when he started his ministry?
[44:55] Is it when is it when John the Baptist
[44:58] say, "Behold the lamb of God."
[45:04] So the answer is
[45:06] All is his coming.
[45:11] It is his coming but in steps.
[45:12] Hallelujah.
[45:16] And when you look at his going still the
[45:18] same.
[45:21] So we see that the pattern was laid in
[45:23] his first coming.
[45:28] And now if you could stand and take the
[45:29] reading the book of Isaiah chapter
[45:34] chapter 60 verse one
[45:42] verse one
[45:49] I always say that it's a blessing to
[45:50] serve God
[45:55] and I thank pastor for letting us
[45:58] also do something serve the lord.
[46:05] So Isaiah 60 verse 20 say that arise
[46:10] arise and shine
[46:13] for thy light is come
[46:17] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[46:20] thee.
[46:23] For behold, darkness shall cover the
[46:25] earth,
[46:28] and gross darkness the people,
[46:32] darkness, and gross darkness,
[46:38] but the Lord shall arise upon thee,
[46:42] and his glory
[46:45] shall be seen upon thee.
[46:49] Let us pray again. Lord, dear heavenly
[46:50] father, we may come
[46:53] and Lord just share with us, Father.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; May we see your glory and may we see
[46:58] your light
[47:01] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:04] May be seated.
[47:09] So this scripture denominations they
[47:11] read it day in day out
[47:17] and they love it so much. Arise
[47:24] They even make groups. They call them
[47:26] arise and shine.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; But uh to us
[47:34] we have got the revelation.
[47:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have got the
[47:39] revelation
[47:42] by the message
[47:45] today.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. This inspiration was combined. I
[47:51] was sharing with
[47:53] brother last time and then also I got
[47:56] this inspiration from the message
[47:57] shalom.
[48:04] Shalom and also Elijah and Elisha
[48:10] because after sharing with the brother
[48:14] I got some questions.
[48:17] So I went and I started searching
[48:20] and then I realized something so
[48:21] interesting.
[48:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; So I'm going mainly talk about uh if God
[48:30] gives us time don't worry I will not
[48:31] take long.
[48:34] If I could go through Matthew chapter
[48:37] 26,
[48:40] I believe it will be a blessing for us.
[48:44] Here Isaiah saying that arise and shine.
[48:49] And this was a prophecy
[48:52] for the end time.
[48:54] And now what does the prophet say?
[48:58] What is the light?
[49:01] Shalom.
[49:03] He say that what is the light?
[49:08] The vindicated spoken word of God.
[49:14] Not only the spoken word
[49:18] but spoken and vindicated
[49:23] like when he said in the beginning that
[49:24] let there be light.
[49:29] If the light didn't manifest,
[49:33] it would have not been light.
[49:37] Hallelujah. And then here he says that
[49:40] um yeah, he even said it here that
[49:43] outside of that there is no light.
[49:48] That son is the word of God.
[49:53] In the beginning, God said,
[49:56] "Let there be light.
[50:00] And when the manifested the the
[50:02] manifested word of God
[50:05] when the word of God was manifested
[50:08] there was light
[50:11] first God spoke it.
[50:14] What if it didn't manifest?
[50:17] Then it wasn't light yet.
[50:22] And then here again down he say that if
[50:24] he'd come
[50:27] said he was Messiah
[50:32] and he didn't do like the Bible said
[50:38] then he wasn't the light of the world.
[50:43] [Music]
[50:44] See it's the it's the vindicated word
[50:48] that makes it the light of the world.
[50:56] There is a spirit.
[50:59] I believe when I was studying I I I
[51:01] believe that you know the prophet said
[51:03] that the end time I mean the New
[51:05] Testament preacher is a prophet.
[51:11] So I believe this is like a prophetic
[51:14] uh
[51:16] someone if I'm to call it
[51:22] Because there is a a demon I want to
[51:24] deal with here by the grace of God
[51:29] that has come
[51:31] but also it is coming.
[51:35] It has come but it is coming
[51:41] like it it's going to increase its
[51:42] power.
[51:44] Hallelujah. And in very many messages
[51:47] the prophet has warned us
[51:49] [Music]
[51:51] And that is what is going to make us
[51:52] perfect.
[51:55] Because when the seeds were revealed to
[51:58] us,
[52:00] then we could be able to see all the
[52:03] tricks of the devil
[52:06] and see what is coming ahead.
[52:09] And when it happens, we know where we
[52:11] are standing.
[52:16] That's why this eve this time around
[52:19] she's not going to fail.
[52:24] Hallelujah.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a brother I shared with
[52:28] last time and u
[52:31] he was telling me
[52:34] there are very many things on internet
[52:36] or
[52:38] website people speak a lot of things
[52:42] and mainly when you are evangelizing to
[52:44] them
[52:46] you come to understand what is in their
[52:47] head.
[52:50] So uh people they talk about brother
[52:54] Braham they talk about the ministry
[52:56] [Music]
[52:58] to bring it down to bring it down
[53:04] how it was for
[53:08] and also
[53:10] uh all all these Pentecostal circles
[53:12] these nation circles
[53:16] they also believe
[53:19] that he was the might man of God, the
[53:21] prophet of God.
[53:25] But he reached a time and he erad
[53:30] the track. So there are three groups
[53:32] that I want us to talk about.
[53:38] I want to talk about um
[53:42] these people
[53:45] who believed when he was just coming
[53:47] starting his ministry
[53:51] and then and then they turned against
[53:53] him later
[53:57] and also talk about the bride of Jesus
[53:59] Christ.
[54:01] Hallelujah.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then there's also
[54:04] another group.
[54:07] It's also hidden in the bride.
[54:09] And this is Judas.
[54:12] Hallelujah.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; So when you listen to the tape called um
[54:20] it's called uh
[54:23] is there a man here who can turn on the
[54:24] light?
[54:29] The prophet he was not joking. There was
[54:32] no joke.
[54:35] If you listen to his voice
[54:38] when he was warning us the time that is
[54:41] coming ahead.
[54:43] But he told us that don't fear.
[54:47] He said you'll remember this
[54:51] because remember there is a man who can
[54:53] turn on the light
[54:56] and take you through. Do you believe
[54:59] that this the the the squeeze is coming
[55:03] and the persecution of the bride
[55:09] But listen, he said that God won't let
[55:12] his bride suffer.
[55:17] He will quickly take her.
[55:20] Hallelujah.
[55:21] So there there there are these spirits
[55:23] that are there. There's this spirit that
[55:24] is there,
[55:27] but it is also going to come in full
[55:29] force.
[55:32] And also there's a brother that I talked
[55:33] to from another church now
[55:37] and I discerned his spirit like as if
[55:39] he's trying to bring the message.
[55:43] He didn't say it clearly
[55:52] but I saw where it is going.
[55:57] Hallelujah. So I want us to open
[56:00] together
[56:04] in the book of Matthew chapter 26.
[56:12] Last time, the first time I stood here,
[56:17] the last time I stood,
[56:20] I talked about this lady of Matthew
[56:22] chapter 26.
[56:25] And I realized later that many of you
[56:27] didn't understand the lady I was talking
[56:29] about
[56:33] because I asked my wife at home. She she
[56:35] was lost also.
[56:40] So this lady of Matthew 26,
[56:45] she's the lady of the alabaster box.
[56:50] And you remember I said that
[56:53] the whole plan of God of redemption, the
[56:57] Old Testament, everything was hinged on
[56:59] that little lady.
[57:06] And this lady, she was the she was
[57:10] climaxing the going of Christ.
[57:16] She's the one that caused his going.
[57:20] Because when you you read this chapter
[57:22] from the start,
[57:26] you will see that these people they they
[57:27] were plotting from the beginning
[57:29] actually
[57:31] [Music]
[57:32] from far in the beginning
[57:36] they wanted to kill him but they
[57:37] couldn't
[57:40] but we see when this lady came in the
[57:41] picture
[57:44] immediately they killed him.
[57:47] Hallelujah.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we are going to see what
[57:50] the cause was. But we at the beginning
[57:53] of this this chapter
[57:58] you will see
[58:00] that uh these people were planning.
[58:07] But the scriptures show you that they
[58:10] were not ready to kill him
[58:15] because they were it was during the
[58:16] festival season.
[58:24] Yes. But we see that this lady
[58:28] by her decision she made
[58:32] and and entering into that house.
[58:37] Was it Simon the leaper? I think.
[58:42] And she was a despised lady.
[58:46] But she got all that she had that
[58:48] alabaster box
[58:55] and she powered it on the Jesus
[58:58] and she started washing his feet
[59:03] with tears.
[59:06] The unwelcomed Christ
[59:10] but she welcomed him.
[59:14] And now from that moment
[59:18] remember these are the circumstances
[59:20] around the coming.
[59:25] And now when I talk about the coming I
[59:26] mean the going
[59:31] and you remember me telling you that you
[59:32] you are that lady
[59:36] that is the bride of Jesus Christ
[59:40] a sinner.
[59:42] But all she could do
[59:45] is to surrender whatever she her heart.
[59:50] And you know that heart the heart of a
[59:52] person
[59:55] is the most expensive organ in the body.
[1:00:00] Hallelujah.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; So she had the most expensive oil.
[1:00:07] So when she powered it until even the
[1:00:10] disciples saw it was a west.
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:16] But you see when you go to John, John
[1:00:20] will will point out specifically that it
[1:00:23] was Judas,
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:28] the Judas group.
[1:00:33] Now let's read here chapter 16.
[1:00:38] The Bible says, of course, I'm jumping a
[1:00:40] lot of things, but you read that chapter
[1:00:42] on your
[1:00:46] if you can note down some a few things
[1:00:49] and you read it to bless you. Verse 16
[1:00:52] say that and from that time he saw
[1:00:54] opportunity to betray him.
[1:01:02] From what time?
[1:01:04] from the time that this lady
[1:01:08] made the decision she made.
[1:01:11] Hallelujah. So we see that Judas
[1:01:15] was hiding.
[1:01:17] He was hiding among the believer
[1:01:20] and what you need to know that Judas is
[1:01:23] a message believer
[1:01:27] and he's a very precious brother.
[1:01:31] Hallelujah.
[1:01:33] Because Jesus said that one of you is
[1:01:35] going to betray me
[1:01:38] to the extent that John thought maybe
[1:01:40] he's the one.
[1:01:43] Peter thought maybe it's
[1:01:45] no one said maybe this
[1:01:52] brother Judas he was a very precious
[1:01:56] Hallelujah. But now
[1:01:59] in in his goodness,
[1:02:02] there were a lot of demons resting on
[1:02:04] him.
[1:02:08] A lot of spirits. And now these spirits
[1:02:11] needed something to provoke them.
[1:02:18] Hallelujah. And now this is the work of
[1:02:20] the bride. Now,
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; so this is like a warning.
[1:02:28] It is there now, but it's really coming.
[1:02:33] Hallelujah.
[1:02:35] And here you can use verse 21. He said
[1:02:39] as they did eat,
[1:02:42] he said, "Verily, I say unto you,
[1:02:46] one of you shall betray me."
[1:02:49] And they were exceedingly sorrowful.
[1:02:53] And began every one of them to say unto
[1:02:55] him,
[1:02:56] Is it I?
[1:02:58] [Music]
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:03:05] uh, it's it's you remember I told you
[1:03:08] that it's the bride
[1:03:11] holding the last events
[1:03:19] and the timelines. Everything is in your
[1:03:21] hands.
[1:03:23] And that's why she's so precious.
[1:03:27] That's why God is trusting on her,
[1:03:29] waiting on her,
[1:03:33] but she's lingering.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; But anyhow, he's trusting her. He's
[1:03:39] trusting her
[1:03:42] and we are going to make it because God
[1:03:44] is going to give us grace.
[1:03:48] Hallelujah.
[1:03:50] because
[1:03:52] he's going
[1:03:54] in his first going we see
[1:03:58] that
[1:04:00] these demons that were in Judah they had
[1:04:01] to be manifested
[1:04:05] and from that time the Bible says
[1:04:09] he saw an opportunity to betray him
[1:04:14] to betray who his precious Lord
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:20] Hallelujah.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:04:24] Judas,
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; we see him going and uniting with uh the
[1:04:30] denominations of that.
[1:04:36] Not really believing in what they are
[1:04:37] believing,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; but being on that side
[1:04:46] as we are going to see.
[1:04:49] And also the prophet says something here
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; that Herod and Pilates
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; they also united.
[1:05:05] And then you see that the religious
[1:05:07] powers united political power
[1:05:13] just because of Jesus.
[1:05:17] Not because they wanted, but because of
[1:05:19] Jesus.
[1:05:22] Because they they wanted to get him out.
[1:05:27] Squeeze him out of them.
[1:05:30] Now here he say that in shalom he says
[1:05:32] that the darkness is separating itself
[1:05:35] from the light.
[1:05:39] God is causing it.
[1:05:42] The light is doing it.
[1:05:47] We see that there has to be a point of
[1:05:50] separation.
[1:05:54] It has to be there and this point of
[1:05:57] separation.
[1:05:59] It is not only the denomination
[1:06:04] but also the Judas group.
[1:06:10] We said the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; has to be on a certain side.
[1:06:16] And when the prophet preached this
[1:06:18] message shalom,
[1:06:20] he preached it as a new year message.
[1:06:27] That was 1964.
[1:06:30] It was the first message.
[1:06:33] And he said,
[1:06:36] "Shalom,
[1:06:38] God's peace."
[1:06:40] Good morning.
[1:06:42] That's what it means. means good
[1:06:44] morning. God's peace
[1:06:47] meaning that to the bride it's light.
[1:06:50] It's a a new day.
[1:06:55] But to to the church
[1:06:59] it is darkness
[1:07:02] and to the world
[1:07:05] it's gross darkness.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:10] And now we see that for us
[1:07:14] here we have received a message
[1:07:17] and this is the only hope that we have
[1:07:20] that will separate us
[1:07:23] and this is what that brings separation
[1:07:28] a surrendered heart
[1:07:33] just as simple as that.
[1:07:36] The prophet said that the more the bride
[1:07:39] surreners,
[1:07:43] the more she unites,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; the more the separation.
[1:07:49] Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; The more the separation.
[1:07:53] Hallelujah.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I fear a lot of things
[1:07:56] coming. May God give me grace. But
[1:07:59] we see here
[1:08:03] this spirit,
[1:08:05] it comes
[1:08:07] and attacks the believers.
[1:08:10] And it is a spirit of discouragement
[1:08:12] about the message
[1:08:15] about the message
[1:08:18] and shakes those that are
[1:08:22] not firm in the message
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:26] and they fall off.
[1:08:28] Many have left this land
[1:08:32] because of some many things
[1:08:35] because they are not strong.
[1:08:38] They have not known what they have
[1:08:39] believed.
[1:08:41] Some have believed this message because
[1:08:43] of the cloud
[1:08:46] because of the signs
[1:08:49] and the manifestation.
[1:08:51] You see,
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; but but the bride
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; as we going to see
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; she has gone inside
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; and she has received the light.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And uh here
[1:09:12] there is this um
[1:09:15] preacher Pentecostal preacher who came
[1:09:18] recently in Uganda.
[1:09:20] the one who came at miracle center.
[1:09:24] I heard him saying that brother was a
[1:09:26] might man of God
[1:09:29] but he eroded
[1:09:33] in his teaching in his teachings
[1:09:37] and that's what the Bible college also
[1:09:39] says.
[1:09:44] Hallelujah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; But now remember whatever you say has to
[1:09:48] be scripture. Has
[1:09:53] in the Bible has God ever sent any man
[1:09:55] any prophet
[1:09:58] and he eroded?
[1:10:01] No. So it's un scripture.
[1:10:04] So it's another gospel. But we are going
[1:10:07] to see what caused this.
[1:10:11] First of all, what is the message? Let's
[1:10:13] know what's the message.
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:17] M
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; the word of God revealed.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; It is so sad. There is a preacher here
[1:10:26] in Uganda.
[1:10:29] You know him, but I've heard him saying
[1:10:33] that now in America
[1:10:38] the news have come out.
[1:10:41] The government has confirmed
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; that the pillow of cloud it was wrong.
[1:10:46] It was
[1:10:49] it was not
[1:11:15] And you say I thought this is a person
[1:11:18] and maybe God used him even to bring men
[1:11:20] to Christ.
[1:11:24] But they are leaving it and they are
[1:11:25] going to leave it.
[1:11:29] But it's all about us to know where we
[1:11:31] are standing
[1:11:34] and what we have believed.
[1:11:37] Hallelujah.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And also
[1:11:40] you remember the Elijah the Tishite
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; when he was going
[1:11:49] uh the prophets the Bible says they were
[1:11:52] the sons of prophets.
[1:11:56] So it's not it's not something so new
[1:12:02] but it has to be tried by the word.
[1:12:07] Because we know that these people, it is
[1:12:08] true, they got vision, they saw the the
[1:12:11] prophet going
[1:12:15] but they used it
[1:12:19] uh with their because they were biased
[1:12:25] and they added things. We are going to
[1:12:27] see why they were biased.
[1:12:33] And what did Elisha reply this Sunday?
[1:12:38] He said, "Hold your peace."
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:12:43] Hallelujah.
[1:12:45] And they kept on like I think like three
[1:12:48] times.
[1:12:52] And Elijah also he was busy
[1:12:55] moving
[1:12:57] from place to place.
[1:13:00] He was busy moving from 19 from 1950s
[1:13:06] 1960
[1:13:07] to 1964
[1:13:09] 1965.
[1:13:12] And the Bible says that then God told
[1:13:15] Elisha Elijah
[1:13:18] to go to Jericho.
[1:13:20] That's a step.
[1:13:22] The prophet talks about it. See, but
[1:13:25] Elisha said as the god live,
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:31] I'm not leaving.
[1:13:33] So we see that he went all the way.
[1:13:40] And each stage he was reaching, he was
[1:13:42] finding the sons of the prophet.
[1:13:46] Hey, God is taking you
[1:13:49] Elijah.
[1:13:51] He said, "Hold your peace. I know."
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And Elijah also knew his going.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a shock that it's the sons of
[1:14:02] the prophet that brought the news.
[1:14:06] But they already knew.
[1:14:10] Elisha, how could he reply like that?
[1:14:13] because he had received a revelation
[1:14:17] of Revelation 10:7
[1:14:19] because he say that
[1:14:25] the mystery of God
[1:14:30] that John I mean Jesus Christ in his
[1:14:33] second coming
[1:14:36] he's coming he's a lion of the world
[1:14:40] but when John turned
[1:14:43] He saw a lamp
[1:14:45] bleeding.
[1:14:47] Hallelujah. And I used ask I used to ask
[1:14:50] myself
[1:14:53] if it's a line why now hear the lamb.
[1:14:59] This lamp is only to the bride.
[1:15:04] You see when you are married to your
[1:15:06] wife you can even be a toughest man in
[1:15:08] the world.
[1:15:13] from work. Then when you go home,
[1:15:17] you can even play around.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; You see, so to his bride,
[1:15:25] he has reduced himself.
[1:15:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And also,
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; yes, it is true to the world, he's a
[1:15:36] liar.
[1:15:39] He's a judge.
[1:15:41] He's indicting this generation.
[1:15:46] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; So, we see here that John came to to
[1:15:50] prepare a way for the lamb of God.
[1:15:54] But not only that, he came as a friend.
[1:15:59] So, there was engagement there.
[1:16:03] There was engagement. So that's why the
[1:16:05] prophet says
[1:16:08] that this Bible
[1:16:12] is a mystery
[1:16:15] just one mystery
[1:16:17] of which Paul said that has been hid
[1:16:22] through the ages
[1:16:24] but now it's been revealed.
[1:16:27] So this mystery is all about marriage
[1:16:32] marriage.
[1:16:35] Hey, we are getting married to Jesus
[1:16:37] Christ.
[1:16:40] Hallelujah.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; It may be somehow hard to swallow, but
[1:16:43] just follow him.
[1:16:59] the nominal churches
[1:17:02] gross darkness.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Because and remember I told you that the
[1:17:10] bride
[1:17:12] is veiled
[1:17:14] during the seven days.
[1:17:18] Hallelujah.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Are we in the seventh day?
[1:17:22] Hallelujah. The bride is veiled. There
[1:17:26] is no one who can tell that this is the
[1:17:27] bride.
[1:17:30] That's why Jacob could not tell
[1:17:33] realized.
[1:17:35] But Matthew 26
[1:17:37] verse 27.
[1:17:40] These are conditions surrounding the
[1:17:42] climax.
[1:17:46] The prophet says that after that lady
[1:17:50] making that decision
[1:17:53] in those last events
[1:17:57] thousands and thousands of scriptures
[1:17:59] were fulfilled.
[1:18:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. said, "And he
[1:18:07] took the cup
[1:18:09] and gave thanks
[1:18:11] and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye
[1:18:15] all of this,
[1:18:18] for this is my blood,
[1:18:21] new testament,
[1:18:23] new covenant,
[1:18:25] which is shed for men,
[1:18:30] for the remission of sins."
[1:18:34] Now I want you to compare this with what
[1:18:36] I've just told you.
[1:18:39] And also if Jesus said
[1:18:42] that this is my new testament,
[1:18:48] where is the the mystery then?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So all that he was talking
[1:19:04] about here,
[1:19:06] it was about engagement
[1:19:09] with his bride.
[1:19:19] Jesus Christ knew the price he was
[1:19:24] even before he left heaven.
[1:19:27] He knew because the call went out
[1:19:32] and they said who is worthy?
[1:19:36] There was no one worthy.
[1:19:39] But Jesus Christ being God being so
[1:19:42] merciful
[1:19:45] and he had a plan.
[1:19:48] He himself had to come
[1:19:52] this cup say that thou when thou prayest
[1:20:00] enter into thy closing
[1:20:04] and when thou hast shut thy door.
[1:20:08] Pray to thy father which is in secret.
[1:20:12] And thy father which seeth
[1:20:16] in secret shall reward thee
[1:20:20] secret place with the father.
[1:20:25] Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; So we are seeing here
[1:20:29] pray. So this this can mean our daily
[1:20:32] life
[1:20:34] how we should behave and conduct
[1:20:36] ourselves.
[1:20:38] in your house.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Close yourself.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; But I want us to look beyond that.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; is a secret place with the father.
[1:20:52] It is a certain dimension
[1:20:56] that you enclose yourself.
[1:20:59] Not your room at at your home,
[1:21:04] but in a certain dimension.
[1:21:07] God talked to us last time about come up
[1:21:09] hither
[1:21:14] meaning that is darkness
[1:21:19] shalom
[1:21:20] [Music]
[1:21:22] come up hither
[1:21:24] to the new day.
[1:21:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because to us
[1:21:29] the brightest is light.
[1:21:34] Let me tell you saints.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; You see, even those brothers can
[1:21:39] testify. People that we have tried to
[1:21:42] reach out to,
[1:21:46] you can preach to someone. If he has
[1:21:48] helped you, he will give you ears.
[1:21:54] And if he has really really helped you,
[1:21:58] you will come to church like twice.
[1:22:01] and disappears.
[1:22:04] You try all your best
[1:22:06] and then you wonder
[1:22:09] because the Bible says that is gross
[1:22:11] darkness.
[1:22:16] They can't even see that Jesus Christ is
[1:22:18] outside
[1:22:24] and then you just go back.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; If you God do for you something
[1:22:33] He's more than able.
[1:22:36] The prophet says that the New Testament
[1:22:40] bride.
[1:22:59] Then he realized he was in another
[1:23:01] dimension.
[1:23:03] And in this dimension
[1:23:05] he saw himself on the lake.
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:10] And on the lake he looked in the lake.
[1:23:13] He saw
[1:23:16] the rainbow strut.
[1:23:19] He calls them the rainbow strat.
[1:23:23] These are kind of beautiful fishes.
[1:23:32] that were preaching alongside with him.
[1:23:36] And now immediately before I read
[1:23:39] after that he successfully pulled that
[1:23:41] fish
[1:23:45] and immediately then he saw when he's
[1:23:48] holding a baby shoe
[1:23:51] baby
[1:23:53] shoes
[1:23:55] and then he was trying to put the sho
[1:23:57] lace
[1:23:59] in this eye of the
[1:24:02] but it could not pass because it was too
[1:24:04] big.
[1:24:07] And then he was like, "Watch this." And
[1:24:08] then the angel told him that how can you
[1:24:10] teach
[1:24:12] supernatural things to the baby?
[1:24:18] And I want you to hear.
[1:24:20] He said, "You see the first pull was
[1:24:22] when you used to pull your to put your
[1:24:24] hands
[1:24:28] on the people and tell them what was
[1:24:31] their trouble."
[1:24:33] The second P was when you know the
[1:24:35] secrets of the heart
[1:24:39] like I told you and said instead of you
[1:24:42] keeping that yourself
[1:24:46] you try to explain all about it
[1:24:50] and tell people and when you did
[1:24:54] said you didn't know nothing about it
[1:24:56] yourself
[1:25:02] Because for him he had just received a
[1:25:03] sign
[1:25:05] and instructions from God. God had told
[1:25:07] him to keep it a secret.
[1:25:11] But here he explained it
[1:25:14] and you've caused a big bunch of car
[1:25:17] impersonations.
[1:25:22] And you see what you've done.
[1:25:25] Very many preachers could even get
[1:25:27] anointing from his hands.
[1:25:31] and go and they start doing miracles
[1:25:34] all these Pentecostal preachers
[1:25:37] when you look at them
[1:25:39] they're coming either from Tosbos
[1:25:42] or Robert from Kenneth Hagen
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; but when you see all the circles they're
[1:25:48] going back to brother Brham
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; so what was the what was wrong
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; he explained a lot about it, talked a
[1:26:01] lot
[1:26:04] and we got a lot of imperson
[1:26:05] impersonation.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he read and when he said that just
[1:26:13] then I I felt myself go higher up.
[1:26:17] I'm jumping a lot of things. And when I
[1:26:20] was set down,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; then I was beneath
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; and standing up above a great tent.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; He saw a tent.
[1:26:32] Now you remember a tent.
[1:26:36] He saw a tent. I never seen such a tent.
[1:26:40] And I had just made an altar call
[1:26:45] seeming like alter. Yeah.
[1:26:49] down at the altar.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And when I was down there, I looked
[1:26:55] and there was hundreds of people
[1:26:57] standing around the altar weeping.
[1:27:02] Okay, I think let me just read and
[1:27:04] finish. Because they had accepted the
[1:27:06] Lord Jesus and they were just weeping
[1:27:09] out loud and saying, "Oh, that's more
[1:27:13] like it like that." and and uh a real
[1:27:17] kind of gentleman walked
[1:27:20] out to the platform said uh while
[1:27:24] brother Branham is resting
[1:27:27] just a few moments this is the brother
[1:27:30] speaking on the platform that brother
[1:27:31] Branham is resting just a moment he said
[1:27:36] we'll call the prayer line and said
[1:27:38] everyone with a prayer card beginning
[1:27:41] with a certain number stand over onto
[1:27:45] the right. Well, I noticed the prayer
[1:27:48] line seemed like it went all around the
[1:27:51] tent and out and down the streets. Such
[1:27:55] a prayer line. Hallelujah.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; So, you read that message by yourself.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; But I want you to see something here.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet said this that was
[1:28:08] the third P.
[1:28:11] And then he the angel said that don't
[1:28:15] say anything about it.
[1:28:18] It's not private.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; No, it's private. It's private.
[1:28:26] And we don't want to have impersonators
[1:28:32] only for the bride. Hallelujah.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:28:37] here the prophet say that now here is
[1:28:41] something not slow. There is difference
[1:28:43] between the angel of the Lord and the
[1:28:45] light because I heard something moving
[1:28:48] as it does when it comes here at the
[1:28:51] platform at night. Kind of like uh
[1:28:56] and like a fire weeping around leaking
[1:28:58] blaze and it left me and it went right
[1:29:00] down over the top of the audience and
[1:29:03] went and stood over the top of the
[1:29:06] little building then settled down on top
[1:29:09] of it. H. And then when it did, this one
[1:29:13] that was standing by me behind me, the
[1:29:16] same voice, the angel voice, he said, "I
[1:29:19] meet you in there."
[1:29:24] And this is the third pool. But nobody
[1:29:26] will know nothing about it.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; So there is something I want us here to
[1:29:31] get.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; May God help each one of us because now
[1:29:35] now this is to every life of an
[1:29:39] individual. Now
[1:29:41] Hallelujah. Remember the tent as I told
[1:29:44] it it is the engagement
[1:29:49] it is it's it's the marriage
[1:29:53] because according according to the
[1:29:54] traditions of the Jews
[1:29:57] they usually use that tent
[1:30:00] and then they stand over it
[1:30:04] copying Sarah Ibrahim where they were
[1:30:08] and Isaac and Sarah
[1:30:11] Isaac and Rebecca.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And now here is all that he's trying to
[1:30:17] say. I will not say a lot, but you'll go
[1:30:18] and read it.
[1:30:22] It is marriage taking place.
[1:30:26] And then the light that he saw,
[1:30:29] he saw it moving.
[1:30:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; So showing that there are few people
[1:30:35] that are inside there.
[1:30:39] Most of them they are here outside.
[1:30:42] Hallelujah. And then you can use people
[1:30:44] were healed
[1:30:48] in that vision
[1:30:50] of which can be both the physical ill
[1:30:53] illness
[1:30:54] and the spiritual illness. Hallelujah.
[1:30:57] Hallelujah.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's why I say that even at the
[1:30:59] listening of the word God can heal your
[1:31:02] disease.
[1:31:06] God can take care of your needs.
[1:31:10] Now as the musicians come,
[1:31:14] we see
[1:31:16] this third P vision
[1:31:19] that the prophet saw.
[1:31:22] There was a prayer line
[1:31:26] and the prophet was resting. He was away
[1:31:32] and he said that he was looking.
[1:31:35] He was high just watching what is taking
[1:31:39] and
[1:31:41] people were entering one by one is
[1:31:43] giving them an advice to pray
[1:31:47] watch and pray.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; So it is all about the union
[1:31:57] with our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; And that's why we don't miss any
[1:32:01] service. We keep coming.
[1:32:05] as much as we can
[1:32:07] because the wedding is taking place.
[1:32:11] And when when you're listening to the
[1:32:12] word of God,
[1:32:15] you give in all that you want, you have
[1:32:17] your heart,
[1:32:20] power your heart
[1:32:23] and said, "God, expose me."
[1:32:27] Hallelujah. And don't forget, the more
[1:32:30] you yield yourself
[1:32:33] the more we are getting far away from
[1:32:36] darkness
[1:32:41] and the more Judas
[1:32:44] is resurrected.
[1:32:48] Hallelujah. Amen. May God bless you. Let
[1:32:50] us pray.
[1:32:51] And at this moment, if you have
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:16] you
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:21] He is
[1:33:24] calling
[1:33:26] now
[1:33:28] your name.
[1:33:31] He
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:36] can touch you.
[1:33:40] You will never
[1:33:43] be
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:51] sweet
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:56] in sing
[1:33:59] our soul
