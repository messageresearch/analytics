TRANSCRIPT
========================================
lord [Music] praise let us first read matthew chapter 5 verses 5. okay we can start from bus uh from the very first verse and seeing the multitude went up into the mountain and when he was set his disciple came unto him and opened his mouth and told them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for there is the king there is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be confrated blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are they merciful for they shall obtain mercy now yes [Music] then i also want uh to read the book of ammos we are reading almost hamas yeah almost chapter 8 verses 11. [Music] behold that they come says the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the word of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and they shall not find it in that day shall the fear shall defeat violence and the young men trained for thirst [Music] father we thank you lord for the reading of the word it's my desire that you come and break this word unto us lord take my knowledge aside and may the holy spirit speak through me tonight in jesus name amen i mean maybe praise the lord come here i will come in the praise of the lord tonight and i thank god for my pastor that has given me uh an opportunity to stand before the bride of christ standing here it's never been easy and this is the only way god speaks to us the highest way god speaks to man let's [Music] you all the praises of the lord and this evening i want to talk uh i'm going to share about hungering for more of god here this word came from jesus himself from his own lips it says that blessed are they which do hunger and thurst after righteousness for they shall be filled with of the lord come blessings blessed are those who hunger and thus after righteousness shall be filled blessed by the name of the lord amen brother joel i request you to try to open that amen i mean so jesus himself yes in this chapter the bible tells us when the bible is saying that the multitude seeing the multitude he went up into um he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciple came unto him and he opened his mouth and told them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven things that started changing now the direction has started going different directions because majority followed him because of the miracles and the signs and the food yes unless you eat my flesh but tonight i want us to look at hungering for god they're living in the taste saw it by by the eyes of prophet samus [Music] [Applause] yeah if you turn in the opposite of that one according to you who does not hunger and that's for righteousness because [Applause] of god is amen just imagine you have that painful desire to hear the word of god that is how the church ought to be it cannot separate your way obey that blessing with [Applause] where is the problem it is because you are part with something different amen how can i get anger for god [Music] this evening [Music] is he the spirit of god in the spirit of the [Music] now the very reason that there is a holy spirit is because unless there was something in here to call for it out jesus is saying that blessed are those yes it means you can hardly find that um [Applause] go and cry before god holiness oh [Music] god [Applause] amen i remember we were with brother peter the other day truly tried in organ and peter and we met a brother that sentiment believe in fasting amen sometimes seeking god involved fasting isolation you locked yourself somewhere in the room nobody would carry he could go nobody [Music] of jesus christ telling the people that they don't need to fast i challenge them in the name of the lord he accepts my [Music] and strike their souls with the power of the resurrection prayer tonight that god sent the holy ghost in the disappearance [Music] is the name of the lord [Music] jesus come and give us the word praise the lord and then peter asked them to ask him we really did our best they still had the other revival when they because [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that will keep us on our knees praying for things to survive in the name of the lord and i want to tell you there is still more of god for us jesus is the founding that we cannot exist yes oh yes you know they are men and women what do you have to say before him they have relaxed the prophet fasted for us he prayed for us and now [Music] but there are people who cherish their stomach more is [Music] is and is is is teaching us how to match with jesus [Music] oh [Music] is [Applause] is [Music] [Music] if you say no more [Music] [Music] body of christ rise in the power of the holy ghost the body of christ raising the holy ghost [Applause] that's why that amen now as long as you are waiting and hungering to get back to god there is a god calling somewhere what was calling for you know why you are creator one time jacob saw that you just get over with it like that he looked after his possession with [Music] he had to send them in groups and when they reached there also knew his enemy he said oh my god how they call them you must [Applause] here blessing the name of the lord but remember jacob had a promise in his life right when they were still in their mother's womb god spared their waiting waiter he started developing that anger injury you amen said god i don't even intend to do this you spoke about this that night when we are the name of the lord what do we need to do jesus will not call him to be in maybe like abram where he was blaming jesus there was no ship there but because abram was in prayer he knew that god provided him a lamb yeah wrestling [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] now as long as you are waiting and hungering to get back to god there is a god somewhere according to you [Applause] [Music] god wants to come down and make love to you like okay you're speaking the thirsting and the hungering trying to get to some of your stature heart to make love to you know it takes the mountain yes sir sometimes it breaks us just to express love to us so what we need hungering for god that every time we get a little time some people will sneak here being prayer because they are hungering for god [Applause] [Music] you said that if you come to criticize what's the kolokota the devil is going to show you plenty to precise if you come to find the faults [Music] everywhere everyone because that's what you came to see amen man you cannot come listen forth and see something good let me guarantee those women who dress in long skirts like all the people for your information they are legends they are legends and when you see them [Music] amen when god created the universe and say this is good oh brother is [Music] listen the devil is going to show you plenty of faults but if you come hungry and fasting for god angels of god will direct you to the spot to find amen maybe you have been hungry for the holy spirit today [Music] sometimes you think maybe when i sit where someone is sitting i will be able to i will shout like him or mother was a singer here because this is the right place for you for you would have been to the catholic church one day i went in there and i found the the mamas these uh statues [Music] how can oh glory be to god that when we enter in the courts of the lord and the time is god give me [Music] [Applause] and sometimes they tell you how small spiritual they are brother i can't even hold the sister on the waist and i don't watch life i can't even sleep on that word and i amen how can you go to bar again the spirit of god will never take you to bed it will take you to fellowship you cannot remain [Applause] [Music] the name of the lord because where the holy ghost is come i'm going to talk about he will lead us to all the truth he will reveal this thing to us but i'm saying revelation cannot be emphasized to believer it cannot be over emphasis like emphasize to a believer blessed be the name of the lord come in this way so we need that hunger in our heart amen you see the holy spirit in you will not hunger for the if it is hard for you to go to church listen [Music] meaning that each one of us it is our duty for faith to come for rehearsal yes we are being told how we are going to merge with christian us they speak anyhow blessed in the name of the lord amen neighbor is a symbol priests speak with the honor began their research they take care whatever you cannot be better than unless your father is the devil one day he sat there maybe it was an evening i will exult my throat we should love and we should love one another more than we ever did in all our there [Music] when jesus rose from the dead yes [Applause] and as much as i long to go hunting and fishing in the uh in the in the outdoors yet my heart is more hungering to get on top of that mountain and talk to god than anything i know of hungering for the word of god [Music] brother branham used to use that opportunity every time he went into the mountains he said he was hungering to do what i can buy a little monkey to talk it is even they shall be filled that we will hang and thirst for him day and night may god bless you okay amen blessed father [Music] it is our desire tonight we are not very wrong lord i believe that you have spoken to some of us you're not beginning with lord we cannot have that hang unless you become that hunger in us and thirst in us
