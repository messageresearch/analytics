[0:38] I'm speaking to you this morning on a
[0:41] very important subject is
[0:49] second Kings chapter 20 from verse
[1:00] in those days was Hezekiah sick unto
[1:03] death and the prophet Isaiah the son of
[1:06] Moses came to him and said unto him thus
[1:10] saith the Lord
[1:11] set the in-house in order for Thou shalt
[1:15] die and not leave
[1:18] then he turned his face to the wall and
[1:21] prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech
[1:24] thee O Lord remember now how I have
[1:28] walked before thee in truth and with the
[1:32] perfect with a perfect heart and have
[1:34] done that which is good in thy sight and
[1:38] Hezekiah whip so
[1:40] and it came to pass before Isaiah was
[1:43] gone out into the middle court that the
[1:47] word of the Lord came unto him saying
[1:50] turn again until Hezekiah the captain of
[1:54] my people thus saith the Lord the god of
[1:58] David thy father I have heard thy prayer
[2:02] I have seen the tears behold I will heal
[2:06] thee
[2:07] on the third day Thou shalt go up into
[2:10] unto the house of the Lord and I will
[2:13] add unto thy days 15 years and I will
[2:16] deliver thee and this city out of the
[2:19] hand of the king of Prayer
[2:21] and I will defend this city for my own
[2:24] sake and for my servant David is sake
[2:27] and Isaiah said take alarm or fix and
[2:32] they took and laid it on the boil
[2:35] and he recovered
[2:37] is
[2:42] um
[2:57] foreign
[3:28] [Music]
[3:52] foreign
[4:32] amen Lord Jesus look at my ears we
[4:35] object and a portion of scripture
[4:38] we are breaded as men
[4:41] but we ask for inspiration from Europe
[4:45] not come here to see one another
[4:49] I have not even come here to talk to
[4:51] these people of my own language
[4:54] I need you Lord to give me utterance
[4:58] Use Me Lord because the sun will come up
[5:01] and may you put bind us all together in
[5:03] the same spirit this morning
[5:07] that your word will have free points
[5:21] praise the Lord
[5:22] praise the Lord come and give us the way
[5:28] as usual I want to request for your
[5:31] undivided attention
[5:36] and try to limit movement as much as you
[5:40] can
[5:44] plus that your Pawn is in silence
[5:54] so that you can be here a hundred
[5:57] percent
[5:59] praise the Lord
[6:06] I want you to look at that
[6:08] you know how many I've ever read this
[6:11] portion of scriptures
[6:18] okay what about those who have never
[6:21] heard of this portion of church
[6:28] and so I want to believe that we are all
[6:31] Christians
[6:33] and so
[6:36] um here was a man
[6:39] a man who whose days had come to an end
[6:46] and God now sent a prophet to him
[6:50] and you know God is always in the
[6:52] business of sending prophets
[6:56] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[6:59] and forever he never changes
[7:03] so if he did send prophets once you will
[7:06] always send foreign
[8:06] men believe in prayer
[8:12] great women have been women of prayer
[8:17] and if you want to be great in this life
[8:22] you must be a man a woman of prayer
[8:27] if you are not a prayerful man or woman
[8:32] you are not great
[8:36] but if you are a prayerful man or woman
[8:41] you are a great man or a great woman
[8:45] and so this was a king
[8:48] and with all that he had done for the
[8:51] Lord
[8:52] suffering and affliction
[8:57] and I want to say that suffering and
[8:59] afflictions are a part of our Christian
[9:01] journey
[9:08] and many times we are in need
[9:11] [Music]
[9:16] times
[9:29] it might sound strange but it is not
[9:31] strange
[9:36] one point in your life
[9:47] [Music]
[9:55] you know once always for us to keep
[9:59] focused on those things
[10:07] the devil's plan is to allow you to
[10:11] focus on those things
[10:16] and God will not take them away
[10:22] he will not take away those things
[10:26] a Christian suffers Affliction
[10:31] and we went through that sometime back
[10:34] and you're driving
[10:38] that every Christian in this world
[10:42] at one point will suffer Affliction
[10:47] how men have ever been in need
[10:51] I'm not speaking something strange
[10:54] I'm talking about our everyday life
[11:09] yes how many have ever wanted to have
[11:12] something
[11:15] how many have ever been desperate
[11:47] you know in every continent there is a
[11:50] problem that is
[11:51] prevalents
[11:58] to the Western World
[12:02] you find a lot of natural disasters
[12:09] and a lot of sickness
[12:11] well now you you find that you will they
[12:15] will get Wildfire back to normal
[12:18] and people will lose their property
[12:22] foreign
[13:02] [Music]
[13:44] here in Uganda there has been some sort
[13:47] of lack of food
[13:50] and people go with it with empty
[13:53] stomachs
[13:56] we have also lack of money
[14:01] you find everybody's eyes open
[14:05] trying to see where can they get money
[14:09] people don't come to church because
[14:11] they're trying money
[14:14] people snacks people's phones because
[14:17] they want to save the money
[14:22] so really you know there is problems
[14:25] everywhere
[14:26] like I said here in Africa our greatest
[14:29] physical problem is lack of
[15:02] that's why people become you know they
[15:05] become hard-hearted
[15:08] you know people don't go to churches
[15:10] anymore
[15:12] even when they do they have a form of
[15:14] godliness
[15:22] you have also seen many fresh pastors
[15:31] of us is to try and make some money for
[15:34] themselves
[15:36] they just go there and do some comedy
[15:40] because I knew that people usually are
[15:42] calling for I don't know why over around
[15:44] 20 minutes you know they just deceived
[15:47] in people are and oh they just go and
[15:50] take the money when the man of God tells
[15:53] them look
[15:54] I want you you know I I want to show you
[15:58] something here
[15:59] you know they play their games
[16:03] the lame person
[16:06] many times it is
[16:23] already a false Ministry
[16:27] [Music]
[16:32] true Ministry is usually settled on
[16:35] Christ or where is
[16:38] our emphasis is not a man a man
[16:42] our emphasis is not our Bishop Community
[16:46] this is
[16:59] on Jesus Christ
[17:03] that's the purpose why we are Christians
[17:14] because they want money
[17:16] and they will get this money and they
[17:20] will try to go marry second wife
[17:23] and I will go abroad by Mansions
[17:28] they will drive cars which look like
[17:31] people never foreign
[18:00] [Music]
[18:31] see no more academic but you know when
[18:34] Jesus came in I think it was Simon's
[18:36] house
[18:38] you know they never washed his feet
[18:41] they never they never cleaned him up he
[18:45] never gave him a good seat and they
[18:48] simply told him they just looked at him
[18:51] and he walked in and went to a park a
[18:54] seat
[18:56] nobody attended to him let me tell you
[19:00] that is the the the condition of the
[19:05] churches of Our Generation
[19:08] they have invited Jesus to come in their
[19:11] churches yes
[19:14] they have not attended to him
[19:18] how have they not attended to him
[19:22] by not hearing the word
[19:25] I'm not preaching the word
[19:28] what makes them accepted is not the word
[20:31] foreign
[21:41] foreign
[22:45] foreign
[23:52] praise the name of the Lord
[23:55] hallelujah amen I am not standing here
[23:57] to entertain you see me I'm standing
[24:01] here in the name of the Lord
[24:04] give you the word of God
[24:07] give you the mind of God
[24:19] I am not giving you the word of God
[24:26] they can now
[24:28] says
[24:30] my son I'm not the one talking now

[24:38] What About Us

[25:53] right in our Amina
[26:04] everything can failure is
[26:10] the word of God
[26:16] they are never says
[26:28] you're overcoming your enemies
[26:34] bear is a weapon
[26:37] but any believer can use
[26:41] and praise God it works out
[26:45] how many can shout and say it works
[26:55] you can never be spiritual not to pray
[26:57] because
[27:02] foreign
[27:12] if you don't pray you are not a
[27:14] Christian foreign
[28:38] prayer is the only communication medium
[28:41] between God and Men
[29:32] amen I want you to see this in a message
[29:36] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[29:38] forever

[29:46] place the Bible says
