[8:03] name
[8:08] amen amen God bless
[8:12] [Music]
[8:13] you uh how many enjoyed the Sunday
[8:17] service
[8:20] was was a wonderful wonderful
[8:23] time amen and uh we just trust that the
[8:26] Lord will speak to us once again tday
[8:33] so why don't return to our
[8:37] Bibles in the book of First
[8:45] Peter chapter
[8:50] 3 we are beginning to read from verses
[8:57] one and we shall read up to verse
[9:06] 7 likewise ye wives be in subjection to
[9:11] your own husbands that if any obey not
[9:15] the word they also May without the word
[9:20] be worn by the conversation of the
[9:28] wives
[9:29] [Music]
[9:39] while they behold your chest
[9:41] conversation coupled with
[9:46] fear who adorning let it not be the
[9:50] outward adorning of plating the hair and
[9:53] of wearing of gold or putting on of
[9:58] apparel
[10:08] but let it be the hidden man of the
[10:10] heart in that which is not corruptible
[10:14] even the hment of a Meek and a quiet
[10:17] Spirit which is in the sight of God of
[10:20] great
[10:28] price
[10:31] [Music]
[10:34] for after this manner in the old time
[10:38] the holy women also who trusted in God
[10:41] adorned themselves being in subjection
[10:45] unto their own
[10:56] husbands for even as
[10:59] Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[11:04] whose daughters ye are as long as you do
[11:08] well and are not afraid with any
[11:12] amazement likewise ye husbands dwell
[11:17] with them according to knowledge giving
[11:20] honor unto the wife as unto the weaker
[11:23] vessel and as being hairs together of
[11:26] the grace of life that your prayers be
[11:29] not
[11:57] hindered
[12:03] amen you may be
[12:06] seated you can greet your neighbor and
[12:08] tell them God bless you welcome to the
[12:09] house of God bless
[12:12] you
[12:17] amen is the Lord
[12:20] good it it good to
[12:23] you so this evening I'm speaking on
[12:26] strength in
[12:27] weakness
[12:32] strength in
[12:35] weakness so we notice
[12:38] here Peter starts writing these
[12:43] things and is mainly speaking about the
[12:47] character of a
[12:52] woman um being saying that let their
[12:57] adorning
[12:59] not be the outward
[13:03] daing but we see that we are living in a
[13:05] generation or a
[13:09] time where the woman's strength is in
[13:13] the is in her outside
[13:15] [Music]
[13:18] appearance I'm happy to see you sister
[13:20] Esther we prayed for you so that that
[13:23] her strength is on the outside uh out
[13:27] looks
[13:32] the a typical woman in our generation
[13:34] would not dare go outside without
[13:36] without putting on
[13:38] [Music]
[13:41] makeup because her strength to her is in
[13:45] her
[13:49] makeup but you see the Bible speaks of a
[13:52] woman of character
[13:55] here and it says that her ading should
[13:58] not be the outward
[14:00] [Music]
[14:02] ading you see of plating the
[14:06] hair of wearing of
[14:08] gold of putting on of
[14:12] Apper and we know he is not saying that
[14:14] these are
[14:18] wrong is is not saying that if a woman
[14:21] plated her hair it's
[14:26] wrong or if a husband give her necklace
[14:29] it's
[14:30] [Music]
[14:32] wrong or that if she dressed good
[14:34] clothes it is
[14:37] wrong we know that that's what Paul is
[14:40] that's not what Paul is
[14:42] saying but Paul is saying that her
[14:45] adoring should go beyond
[14:49] [Music]
[14:52] this it should not be the outside things
[14:55] that everybody
[14:57] sees
[15:00] it should be the hidden man of the
[15:05] heart and I know that we are living in a
[15:08] time where
[15:10] ornaments women love
[15:15] ornaments you know you find them using
[15:18] ornaments all over well I've not never
[15:20] seen a Believer who uses earrings at
[15:24] least because we all know that earring
[15:27] is a sign or symbol of
[15:32] slavery that's what in the Old Testament
[15:34] that's what they wore when um they they
[15:37] were going to be a slave
[15:39] [Music]
[15:43] forever when the the trumpet of Jubilee
[15:48] sounded and they
[15:51] refused to be set
[15:53] free then they would be given uh uh what
[15:57] you would call uh and hearing they would
[16:00] be put on the door post and then they
[16:01] would hit their their ear with a hole
[16:04] and then put that ring
[16:08] [Music]
[16:12] there like you see a c when it is
[16:17] tagged and the women today are tagged
[16:19] all over wherever you are
[16:23] going it's a sign that the devil has
[16:26] hold them
[16:27] hostage
[16:29] and that's why Believers don't go for
[16:33] those and so we find that the Bible says
[16:35] the ornament of a of a
[16:40] Believer should be the ornament of a
[16:42] Meek and acquired
[16:46] Spirit you will not you see the women
[16:48] are always after the things that are of
[16:51] high
[16:54] value oh you know the boys out there or
[16:57] the men that marry them them are really
[17:02] strained because they have to keep up
[17:05] with the with the with the with with a
[17:10] value to buy an expensive
[17:13] earring an expensive
[17:16] necklace unexpensive nose
[17:20] Jewel and unexpensive fake
[17:26] eyelashes and and things and then makeup
[17:28] and all those
[17:30] things but you see the Bible says for
[17:32] this
[17:34] woman The Virtuous
[17:36] Woman her hament will be of a Meek and a
[17:40] quiet
[17:44] spirit that is why as much as Believers
[17:47] we know your husband can give you a
[17:54] necklace we really know that believers
[17:56] who are really Holy Ghost filled
[18:01] women that really seek after
[18:03] God they don't have time for for those
[18:07] things you know the their time is really
[18:10] to seek after Holiness to seek after
[18:12] pleasing
[18:14] God their time their time is spent in in
[18:19] prayer in making their
[18:22] home in teaching their
[18:24] children praying for their
[18:27] husbands you see this is uh what a a
[18:30] virtuous woman
[18:33] does and you know the Bible continues on
[18:36] here to
[18:38] say after this manner in this way the
[18:41] all time in the all time the the holy
[18:44] women also who trusted in God they did
[18:47] like
[18:51] this this is how they adored
[18:55] themselves being in subjection unto
[18:57] their own
[19:00] husbands even as Sarah obeyed
[19:04] Abraham calling him
[19:06] Lord praise the name of the Lord I'm
[19:09] just so thankful for this message of the
[19:13] hour this message has liberated the
[19:17] men by setting free the
[19:22] women I'm so thankful that I can walk to
[19:25] a shop
[19:27] somewhere
[19:29] maybe to a jewelry
[19:31] shop Desiring to buy a ring for my
[19:35] wife and I'm so thankful for this
[19:38] message that our eyes will not be all
[19:41] over every jewelry in in the
[19:45] sh oh buy me this oh buy me that oh buy
[19:48] me this by the time she walks out she
[19:51] has several kilograms on her
[19:55] body you will find that even if the
[19:58] woman is
[20:00] Rich As long as she has Christ in her
[20:03] heart those things will not take her
[20:08] heart and the Bible says the old women
[20:10] did the same
[20:13] way Ador themselves that
[20:16] way being in subjection to their own
[20:21] husbands now even as Sarah obeyed
[20:25] Abraham calling him Lord
[20:28] now now we realize that in a
[20:31] marriage is not partnership the way we
[20:35] we think it
[20:41] is we are
[20:44] Partners that's not really the teaching
[20:46] of the
[20:48] Bible in
[20:51] marriage the man is the
[20:53] Lord and the woman is supposed to sub to
[20:56] submit to her Lord
[21:01] that's why sister you should not get
[21:02] married or you should not get married to
[21:04] a man you cannot submit
[21:08] to what is the kind of woman that you
[21:10] are going to
[21:12] marry the what kind of woman I'm talking
[21:14] to the woman what kind of man are you
[21:16] going to
[21:18] marry you're going to marry the kind of
[21:21] man that has the Lord Jesus as his
[21:27] headship Jesus is is his
[21:30] headship then he's not going to you are
[21:32] not going to submit to the
[21:34] devil but if Jesus is not the headship
[21:37] of the
[21:39] man you will never submit to
[21:42] Christ and that's why you should marry
[21:45] Believers all the
[21:47] time never marry an
[21:50] unbeliever because when that
[21:53] happens it breaks the entire
[21:57] chain
[21:59] I'm trying to build something here
[22:01] now if you can follow me so even as
[22:05] Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him
[22:09] Lord whose daughters ye
[22:13] are amen sisters you are the daughters
[22:17] of
[22:18] Sarah as long as you do
[22:21] well and are not afraid with any
[22:26] amazement likewise ye
[22:29] husbands dwell with them according to
[22:34] knowledge giving H unto the
[22:38] wife as unto the weaker
[22:42] vessel everybody say weer
[22:49] vessel weer
[22:52] vessel we
[22:54] vessel oh the brothers love that part
[22:58] [Music]
[22:59] whenever we say sister is a weaker
[23:03] vessel we think that she means it means
[23:05] that she's weak and she's good for
[23:09] nothing but today I want us to look at
[23:12] that I want us to see strength in this
[23:18] weakness amen amen and especially
[23:21] Brothers pay a lot of
[23:24] attention and sisters listen
[23:26] carefully
[23:30] the Bible says if a woman is in
[23:33] subjection to her
[23:37] husband if your husband does not believe
[23:40] the
[23:42] word that him without the
[23:47] word but because of your
[23:50] character because of your obedience and
[23:53] submission to the
[23:55] word it will win him to Jesus
[24:02] Christ now in
[24:04] marriage the woman is place is
[24:09] submission the Woman's Place is
[24:13] submission the man's
[24:16] place is love and cherishing of the
[24:20] wife the woman must submit herself to
[24:23] her
[24:26] husband and the man must love his
[24:31] wife now if one of them leaves their to
[24:34] begin
[24:35] with if you say oh my husband doesn't
[24:38] love me
[24:40] enough that means there's a problem to
[24:42] begin with
[24:44] you the the problem is right there
[24:46] because you see this is
[24:49] intertwined if you think the Lord Jesus
[24:52] does not love
[24:54] you there is a problem with your faith
[24:58] there is a problem with your
[25:00] submission but if you submit to every
[25:03] word of
[25:04] God he will love you with all the
[25:08] love amen and he loves you even
[25:12] unconditionally but if you submit to him
[25:16] you obey his word you do according to
[25:19] his
[25:21] ways you will always see his
[25:25] love and then on down with go I'd like
[25:29] us to see the symbol of
[25:33] submission praise
[25:35] God brother I have a lot of stere so
[25:38] maybe if you want to help me with that
[25:41] uh 1 Corinthians
[25:48] [Music]
[25:53] 11:3 there is a foundation I'm trying to
[25:55] build so you can see something here
[26:00] listen but I would have you know that
[26:02] the head of every man is Christ and the
[26:04] head of the woman is the man and the
[26:06] head of Christ is
[26:17] God every man praying or prophesying
[26:21] having his head covered dishonors his
[26:26] head
[26:33] but every woman that prays or prophesies
[26:35] with her head uncovered dishonors her
[26:46] head for that is even all one as if she
[26:49] were
[26:53] sheven for if the woman be not covered
[26:55] let her also be shown but if it be be
[26:57] ashamed for a woman to be shown or seven
[26:59] let her be
[27:13] covered did we all understand that part
[27:16] please listen carefully here he says if
[27:19] the he says every that the head of every
[27:22] man is
[27:25] Christ and the head of the woman is the
[27:30] man so now and the head of Christ is
[27:34] God so other words the head of the
[27:38] man is
[27:40] Christ the head of the
[27:44] woman is the man if you're following me
[27:47] say
[27:48] Amen every man praying or prophesying
[27:51] having his head covered this hor as his
[27:56] head
[27:59] how many understood that
[28:03] part no one a few of you if a man
[28:09] prays or
[28:11] prophesies having his head
[28:14] covered this his
[28:18] head who is the head of the
[28:21] man Christ so if the man
[28:25] prays or prophesies meaning if a man
[28:28] worships
[28:29] God with his head
[28:32] covered with the physical head
[28:35] covered he's dishonoring
[28:38] Christ that's why we don't put
[28:42] hearts in church when we are praying men
[28:46] we remove our
[28:49] hearts that's why we also do not uh uh
[28:54] grow our hair
[28:56] long
[28:59] you will see it
[29:01] soon verse five but every woman that
[29:03] prays or prop with head and
[29:13] cover so listen so every woman that
[29:16] prays or
[29:19] prophesies her head have physical head
[29:24] covered she dishonors who
[29:31] if a woman
[29:33] pray or
[29:35] prophesies with her head
[29:39] uncovered meaning she has not covered
[29:41] her
[29:43] head she dishonors her
[29:47] head who is her
[29:50] head her
[29:52] husband so that means if a man if a
[29:56] woman prays or
[29:59] size with her head
[30:02] uncovered she dishonors her
[30:07] husband are we all there
[30:09] now and then he continues on if she
[30:13] doesn't cover her
[30:15] head it is the same as if she should
[30:18] shave off
[30:22] [Music]
[30:26] everything
[30:28] if she doesn't cover her
[30:30] head she should remove all the
[30:36] hair but then he says but if it is a
[30:40] shame for a woman to shave
[30:45] everything then she should cover her
[30:50] head so the question is what kind of
[30:52] covering is he talking
[30:56] about read verse 13 here
[30:59] now judge in
[31:01] yourselves is it cly that a woman pray
[31:04] unto God and
[31:10] covered that's not even nature itself
[31:14] teach you that if a man have long hair
[31:16] it is a shame unto
[31:23] him praise God my sound today I don't
[31:28] understand it very well so listen it
[31:30] says judging
[31:31] yourself is it cly that a woman pray
[31:34] unto God
[31:41] uncovered is it good is it right for a
[31:45] woman to pray unto God
[31:47] uncovered does not nature itself teach
[31:50] you that if a man has long hair it is a
[31:52] shame unto
[31:56] him
[31:58] [Music]
[31:59] but if a woman have long
[32:04] hair it is a glory to
[32:08] her for her
[32:11] hair is given
[32:13] her for a
[32:17] cal praise God so what does this
[32:21] imply the Bible has told
[32:25] us the woman if the woman prays with her
[32:28] head
[32:31] uncovered she's dishonoring her
[32:35] husband and then down here on verse 15
[32:37] he has told us her hair is her
[32:43] [Music]
[32:45] covering and then up there he had
[32:47] already
[32:48] said if she is
[32:52] uncovered let her shave
[32:56] everything
[32:58] what does that mean it means if the
[33:00] woman cuts her
[33:04] hair she trims her
[33:07] hair then it is better for her to wipe
[33:10] out
[33:14] everything but because it is a
[33:17] shame for a woman to to to be
[33:23] bheed let her not cut her hair
[33:29] because her hair is given her for
[33:32] [Music]
[33:34] cover if a woman cuts her
[33:37] hair she dishonors her
[33:42] husband hair is a sign of
[33:47] submission hair is a hair is a symbol of
[33:52] submission is a symbol of
[33:55] Glory is a symbol of
[33:58] power somewhere there he said that you
[34:01] see she she has power on her
[34:06] head do you remember
[34:08] Samson the of power was in
[34:13] his the woman has
[34:16] power on her head because of her hair
[34:21] can you imagine that why because hair is
[34:25] a sign of is a symbol of
[34:29] submission and I want to show you here
[34:31] there is power in
[34:35] submission as long as the woman stays in
[34:38] her
[34:39] place there is a power that she
[34:43] wields you know she is the glory to her
[34:47] husband what is the place of a woman in
[34:51] marriage submission what is the place of
[34:54] a
[34:55] man
[34:57] love and if the woman stays in her
[35:01] place she has a lot of
[35:05] power let me tell you sister you can
[35:08] actually control your husband if you
[35:11] submit to
[35:14] him you can control
[35:17] him you have the power to control
[35:20] him if it's your god-given
[35:23] husband you don't need witchcraft to
[35:25] control you
[35:27] you have the power with
[35:29] you to Wi a sword of
[35:32] power but you just need to
[35:36] realize praise God praise God something
[35:40] I want you to see
[35:42] today now remember as we are speaking
[35:46] everything this is the type of the
[35:49] church let us first read joh John
[35:55] 156
[36:01] I hope you understood that Foundation
[36:03] because is the foundation of
[36:07] everything if a man abide not in me he
[36:10] is cast forth as a branch and is
[36:12] withered and Men gather them and cast
[36:15] them into the fire and they are
[36:25] burn abide in me and my words abide in
[36:28] you ye shall ask what you will and it
[36:31] shall be done unto
[36:41] you hallelujah amen here is the
[36:45] spiritual application of what I just
[36:49] said the pride is in her right place of
[36:55] submission submission to every spoken
[36:58] word of
[37:00] God has the
[37:02] power the Bible says Jesus himself said
[37:05] she can ask whatever she
[37:09] will she has the
[37:11] right to wield the the
[37:16] power a lot of power not some power a
[37:20] lot of power there is power in
[37:24] submission as long as a woman submits
[37:26] herself to her
[37:28] husband in this case our husband is
[37:31] Jesus
[37:32] Christ please listen to me here now our
[37:36] husband is Jesus
[37:37] Christ and and and now Jesus himself our
[37:42] husband said If any man abide in
[37:45] me and I abide in him he can ask for
[37:50] whatever he
[37:51] wants anything he wants he will have it
[37:55] what does that mean
[37:57] you cannot abide in
[37:59] Christ unless you submit to
[38:02] him unless you obey every word unless
[38:07] you believe every word you have to do
[38:10] that in order for you to receive
[38:12] whatsoever you
[38:15] need if you are in your right place as a
[38:18] Christian if you are in your right place
[38:20] as a
[38:21] Believer whatever you
[38:23] desire am you have
[38:28] whatever you desire the say whatsoever
[38:31] you
[38:32] desire ask and you shall receive how
[38:35] because you are in
[38:37] Christ if my people that are called by
[38:39] my
[38:40] name hum themselves and
[38:43] pray hear them you see so now the things
[38:48] that we
[38:50] desire it's not about Jesus doing
[38:54] them many things that we want him to
[38:58] do is in the power and control of the
[39:04] Bride he's waiting for you to come in
[39:07] your right
[39:09] place imagine
[39:11] sister if your husband tells you
[39:15] something and you don't obey
[39:17] him and then you tell him you know dear
[39:20] I need a new
[39:22] [Music]
[39:24] dress he'll just behave as if he never
[39:28] had I said I want a new
[39:31] dress he would just pass by I said I
[39:34] want a new
[39:35] dress and now you have become even a bad
[39:39] woman he will even not look at you all
[39:42] he will not hear you
[39:43] anymore but cook him some good
[39:47] food place the food on the
[39:49] table talk well to him talk
[39:53] nicely you know when he arrives at home
[39:57] create that
[39:59] atmosphere did you know that the power
[40:02] to build a home is in the woman's
[40:08] hand power is not in the man's hand is
[40:12] in the woman's
[40:14] hand listen church when you see women
[40:17] that are children that are
[40:20] spoiled in most cases it is their
[40:25] mother when you see good children who
[40:27] are
[40:28] good people appreciate their fathers but
[40:31] it is their
[40:33] mother even the the words you speaking
[40:37] it's not because of your father it is
[40:39] not father
[40:41] tongue his
[40:43] mother the character you have is a is a
[40:47] is a transfer of the character of your
[40:50] mother the life the way of life you are
[40:53] living it came from your mother
[40:56] if you back a lot your mother was
[40:58] backing a
[41:00] lot if you abuse your mother was
[41:04] abusing if you shout your mother was
[41:07] shouting if you calm your mother was
[41:10] calm if you talk well your mother was
[41:12] that
[41:13] way so the character of a mother is
[41:16] always amen controlling the entire
[41:21] household and not is here the woman has
[41:24] a certain power
[41:26] given to her but that power is not given
[41:30] as
[41:32] power that power is engraved in
[41:38] weakness that strength is engraved in
[41:41] weakness by the woman amen submitting
[41:47] herself it seems as if she has come to a
[41:50] place of
[41:52] weakness but don't think it is a place
[41:55] of weakness
[41:58] it is a place of power strength and
[42:02] Authority people see us following
[42:05] Jesus believing everything the word says
[42:09] and they call us fools they call us holy
[42:12] rollers because we shout in church when
[42:15] the spirit comes upon us because we
[42:18] rejoice when the spirit comes upon us
[42:21] then they say we are fools we have lost
[42:23] our mind but they don't know
[42:26] that is a position of power strength and
[42:31] Authority people even some some of them
[42:34] fear to cry in the
[42:36] church they fear to manifest
[42:39] emotion when they feel they're going to
[42:41] be
[42:42] emotional they try to control
[42:44] it come on come
[42:48] on don't be emotional let me tell you if
[42:52] you be like that oh you are not in a
[42:55] place of Authority at
[42:58] all but brother sister if you can accept
[43:02] to be in a place of
[43:04] [Music]
[43:07] weakness crying many times is shown as a
[43:10] as a as somebody who is crying is is in
[43:13] a place of
[43:18] weakness and the one who is looking on
[43:20] is the one who is
[43:22] strong but brother sister strength is
[43:26] revealed in
[43:28] weakness strength is in
[43:30] weakness that person there who shattered
[43:34] who is praying who is crying is wielding
[43:38] a lot of strength that you don't even
[43:40] have an idea what it
[43:44] is you remember the woman
[43:47] called the the mother of
[43:51] Samuel she was just there at the
[43:54] altar praying
[43:58] crying and then when the priest came it
[44:01] looked as if the priest was the one who
[44:03] was
[44:04] strong and the woman was weak said what
[44:07] is wrong with you woman who told you to
[44:10] drink this ear
[44:13] hours and then you know he was a priest
[44:17] he was occupying an
[44:20] office the spirit of God Came
[44:25] Upon why what was
[44:28] that it was the power and the strength
[44:31] of the
[44:32] [Music]
[44:33] woman actually driving and controlling
[44:36] the
[44:38] priest when when the priest came he came
[44:42] with another
[44:43] attitude but when he arrived there the
[44:46] strength the woman
[44:48] had in tears began controlling
[44:53] him and he that was saying why are you
[44:56] you drunk why are you
[44:58] drunk was as if he was
[45:03] Bewitched what you want you shall have
[45:06] it God has given it to you where did
[45:09] those words come from came from the
[45:12] tears of the
[45:14] woman strength is in
[45:18] weakness never never underestimate
[45:21] weakness whenever you are weak there is
[45:25] some strength
[45:27] somewhere there is strength that is why
[45:30] I want to make a
[45:32] statement there is nothing strong like a
[45:35] woman on
[45:40] earth a few amens because you have no
[45:42] revelation of what I'm talking
[45:46] about there is nothing strong on earth
[45:49] like a
[45:51] woman you you say Amen later on you will
[45:55] understand
[45:57] you don't you don't say Amen because you
[45:59] have understood you say Amen because you
[46:00] believe what I'm
[46:03] saying the woman is the strongest
[46:05] creature in the
[46:08] world praise the name of the
[46:11] Lord why because the Bible says she's a
[46:14] weaker
[46:16] vessel which means in her
[46:18] weakness she Wills the power that
[46:21] controls the
[46:24] world look sin the devil could not bring
[46:30] sin without the
[46:34] woman not only that God could not bring
[46:39] Salvation without the woman so in other
[46:43] words the woman is on both
[46:47] ends she wields her strength she wields
[46:51] a
[46:52] power the man actually will listen to me
[46:57] the a man can never attain his
[47:02] potential his full
[47:08] potential to fulfill it without a
[47:17] woman that's why when God created
[47:20] everything he said it is good it's good
[47:22] it's good but when he saw the man he
[47:25] said is not good it's not good why
[47:28] because a woman was
[47:30] missing the woman had to come in
[47:34] view for God to say it is good
[47:41] now
[47:43] listen
[47:46] now praise
[47:48] God Without
[47:50] You Christ is not
[47:54] complete he's the head but you are the
[47:57] body what is the head without the
[48:02] body it's
[48:06] nothing the head needs the body to
[48:09] [Music]
[48:11] function
[48:13] strength is in
[48:18] weakness I'm coming I'm coming to you
[48:20] I'm
[48:22] coming First Peter chapter
[48:24] 3
[48:27] likewise ye husbands dwell with them
[48:28] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[48:30] the wife as unto the weaker
[48:40] vessel now the Bible calls a woman the
[48:43] weaker
[48:46] vessel meaning if the woman is the
[48:48] weaker
[48:50] vessel she must be placed in a
[48:54] place where has an opportunity to wield
[48:57] a certain
[49:00] strength that no one else can
[49:03] wield brother in the message a greater
[49:09] witness a greater
[49:11] witness he says and you and when you you
[49:14] being when you can become nothing in
[49:18] your own
[49:24] sight becoming something in
[49:29] God and always remember this
[49:32] friends the Way Up Is
[49:35] Down tell your neighbor the Way Up Is
[49:39] Down brother Solomon tell your neighbor
[49:41] the way up is
[49:44] down if you want to go
[49:46] up go down if you want to be strong you
[49:51] have to be weak you cannot be strong
[49:54] when you are
[49:57] strong you have to be weak in order to
[49:59] be
[50:01] strong if you are proud you will be
[50:04] brought
[50:06] down if you are humble you will be
[50:08] lifted
[50:10] up and always remember these friends the
[50:13] Way Up Is
[50:15] Down he that exalts himself shall be a
[50:19] best but he that humbles himself shall
[50:22] be
[50:24] exalted when God speaks to
[50:27] you you should humble
[50:30] yourselves the reason why people don't
[50:32] experience
[50:34] God because they are
[50:36] proud what is a proud
[50:40] heart he that doesn't believe he that
[50:44] believes he has everything he
[50:47] needs like says we are
[50:50] rich we are increased with goods and we
[50:52] have need of
[50:54] nothing but because they thought like
[50:57] that God said you don't know you are
[51:01] poor you are blind you are naked and you
[51:04] don't know
[51:06] it why because they think they are
[51:09] something God said you are nothing and
[51:12] I'm telling you church if you think you
[51:14] are something you are nothing before
[51:18] God you think you are nothing I'm here
[51:22] to tell you you are going to be
[51:23] something before God
[51:26] he says just love him with all your
[51:29] heart and forget all you ever know about
[51:33] all other things but Jesus
[51:38] Christ just go ahead and love him and
[51:41] work for him serve him like the woman
[51:46] loves the
[51:47] husband works for the husband you know
[51:50] in the Book of Proverbs it speaks about
[51:52] a a woman a virtuous woman
[51:57] house wakes up
[51:58] earlys for the house works for the
[52:02] house why because she's a servant she a
[52:05] servant serve him why it's a place of
[52:09] weakness it
[52:11] seems if he wants you to be the
[52:16] doorm just be the
[52:19] door it's whatever he wants you to
[52:22] do you do it
[52:26] God will bless
[52:29] you whatever if God wants you to be a be
[52:32] a
[52:35] door lose your
[52:38] identity and receive his
[52:41] identity Lose
[52:43] Yourself and receive him don't look at
[52:46] me as if you're not hearing what I'm
[52:47] saying say
[52:50] amen amen in John 15 ver 5
[52:56] I am the vine he says and you are the
[53:00] branches he that abides in me and I in
[53:04] him the same bring forth much
[53:07] fruit but for without
[53:11] me you can do
[53:14] nothing think about
[53:16] that God is saying you
[53:22] I we can do nothing without you
[53:26] if a man abide not in
[53:28] me he is cast forth as a
[53:31] branch and is
[53:33] withed and Men gather
[53:37] them and cast them into the
[53:39] fire and they
[53:43] bur without God you are
[53:47] nothing let me tell you whatever you
[53:50] want to accomplish in
[53:52] life you can never accomplish anything
[53:55] without
[53:58] him what if you don't put God in your
[54:04] life you are a
[54:07] loser Philippians 4:13 says I can do all
[54:11] things through Christ which strengthen
[54:15] me so in other words through him we can
[54:18] do all things without him we can do
[54:23] nothing so in other words he wants us to
[54:26] be to submit to
[54:29] him if we can submit to
[54:32] him there will be nothing
[54:37] impossible but without him we can
[54:40] accomplish
[54:42] nothing but with him there will be
[54:46] nothing
[54:48] impossible I am telling you even in your
[54:51] life if you can listen to the word we
[54:53] are preaching to you here
[54:56] every Wednesday every Friday every
[54:59] Sunday and you believe it and you do it
[55:04] there will be nothing impossible with
[55:07] you all things shall be made
[55:10] possible why because you have accepted
[55:13] to come to a place of
[55:17] weakness when you are in a place of
[55:21] weakness you are very
[55:23] strong you can do
[55:29] things let me now give you a few
[55:31] examples now
[55:32] here in Luke 1 verse
[55:36] 38 Mary
[55:39] said behold handmade of the
[55:43] Lord be it unto
[55:45] me according to Thy
[55:48] word and the angel departed
[55:51] from did you hear what Mary called
[55:54] herself
[55:55] [Music]
[55:58] hand meaning
[56:03] a
[56:06] nothing this is the Angel of the Lord
[56:08] Angel Gabriel when he
[56:09] came and he spoke to her the word of
[56:13] God Mary never
[56:17] doubted Mary
[56:21] submitted listen
[56:23] submission does not mean
[56:28] agreement you know many times you know
[56:32] women think that they have to agree with
[56:33] their
[56:36] husband no submission does not mean
[56:41] agreement you may not understand what
[56:43] he's
[56:44] saying you may not even believe
[56:48] it you you can't make your mind agree to
[56:53] it but in your heart you submit to it
[56:57] with all your
[56:59] heart you don't know how it can happen
[57:02] you don't know how it will
[57:04] be but you submit
[57:06] yourself you say you've said
[57:08] it I believe it that settles
[57:12] it that is
[57:15] submission now
[57:17] Mary when the angel came she was
[57:21] confused how will these things happen
[57:25] and and the angel told her the spirit of
[57:27] God will overshadow
[57:29] you and then Mary said the moment she
[57:34] had let me ask you a question do you
[57:36] think that Mary knew how the spirit
[57:38] would
[57:42] overshot did she have all
[57:45] answers she didn't have all
[57:47] answers but Mary
[57:50] beli and decided to
[57:53] submit now
[57:55] she was
[57:57] strong when she had her
[58:00] will but when she hum
[58:04] herself to his
[58:07] will she was no longer
[58:09] strong she was not
[58:12] vulnerable to his
[58:14] will said be it unto
[58:17] me according to your
[58:19] wife now she was I'm the hand I'm I'm a
[58:23] hand I'm just as I'm
[58:27] nothing I'm just humbling myself here I
[58:30] don't know how it's going to be I don't
[58:32] I've never seen the spirit of a shadow
[58:34] anybody and they they become
[58:38] pregnant I've never seen how it happened
[58:41] I don't know how it is done but all I
[58:43] know is you have said it and all I know
[58:47] is you are my Lord so I am saying let it
[58:51] be according to what you say
[58:55] and then she humbled herself that was
[58:59] submission did you realize that Mary at
[59:03] that time at that
[59:05] place she was put in a
[59:08] position of
[59:11] strength Mary accomplished something no
[59:14] man has ever
[59:19] accomplished now tell me who is greater
[59:22] than a woman in the world
[59:25] Mary accomplished
[59:27] something Mary brought forth the
[59:31] Messiah the Bible tells
[59:34] us to Mary says you are
[59:38] blessed among all
[59:40] women you are
[59:42] blessed the blessing of God it maketh
[59:46] rich and he adds no
[59:48] soul Mary was blessed that means that
[59:52] she was the richest woman ever
[59:56] why because she submitted herself to the
[59:59] word submission is power and because she
[1:00:05] submitted she brought forth the
[1:00:08] Messiah none else could do
[1:00:11] it but the but a woman under
[1:00:17] submission a man can could not do
[1:00:21] it a man cannot do it a PRI could not do
[1:00:24] it an angel could not do it I don't know
[1:00:27] whether you understand what I'm talking
[1:00:28] about no one could do it not even the
[1:00:32] angels of God not even the biggest
[1:00:34] priest or the biggest
[1:00:36] Prophet but a
[1:00:38] woman I imagine that why because God
[1:00:43] wanted to show that strength is in
[1:00:49] weakness and the savior of the world
[1:00:52] came through a woman
[1:00:55] not just a woman but a woman who was
[1:00:58] nothing and
[1:01:00] nobody
[1:01:01] despised from a despised
[1:01:05] town she didn't even have a place to go
[1:01:07] to bring forth
[1:01:10] him he he came in a a very despised
[1:01:16] way powerful things come
[1:01:20] small small but the problem with our
[1:01:24] generation
[1:01:25] we all want big
[1:01:27] things when we see Small Things We
[1:01:31] despise them we want big things and we
[1:01:35] want them fast so we we leave what would
[1:01:38] have taken us to
[1:01:42] Greatness and we rush for the big things
[1:01:45] which will evate like
[1:01:49] Vapor but here is Mary she was humble
[1:01:53] she was down there and then when when
[1:01:55] the angel of the Lord came you know the
[1:01:58] Angels Came among the
[1:02:01] Shepherds who are the Shepherds they
[1:02:03] were the weakest they were the most
[1:02:07] despised and and and the angels of God
[1:02:10] did not come to the
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:15] Palace there is something I'm coming
[1:02:18] to if you want God to speak to
[1:02:21] you if you want angels of God to come to
[1:02:24] you
[1:02:25] if you want to receive the Holy
[1:02:28] Spirit humble
[1:02:32] yourself come down submit yourself to
[1:02:34] the
[1:02:36] word the way up is
[1:02:39] down and then the priests were just the
[1:02:42] Shepherds were just you know uh watching
[1:02:45] over sheep at
[1:02:47] night and then the Angels showed up and
[1:02:51] they began singing they began telling
[1:02:53] them they
[1:02:56] he's born thei of the
[1:03:01] world why preached a message why it had
[1:03:04] to be
[1:03:08] shepher God is revealed in
[1:03:11] simp not in great big
[1:03:14] things not in stands
[1:03:17] and but in a still Small
[1:03:20] Voice and many people Miss God because
[1:03:24] they're waiting for him to speak in a
[1:03:27] thunder they're waiting him to roar like
[1:03:29] a
[1:03:31] lion God speaks in
[1:03:34] Simplicity you may have a problem right
[1:03:36] now in your life and you are here
[1:03:39] listening to me but in this Simplicity
[1:03:42] God may be giving you
[1:03:44] Solutions but you may miss it if you
[1:03:47] don't see
[1:03:50] God God works in
[1:03:53] simplicity he doesn't work in great
[1:03:55] Thunders and great big
[1:03:58] things he works in simple
[1:04:01] ways that's how he was born in our
[1:04:05] generation he spoke to us through a
[1:04:08] seventh
[1:04:11] grader he didn't have a degree in
[1:04:15] theology brother Bram was very
[1:04:18] humble he claimed to know
[1:04:23] nothing made him speak
[1:04:26] things bring
[1:04:28] Revelations that you could not even find
[1:04:30] with a PhD
[1:04:33] holder what was that strength in
[1:04:38] weakness and I tell you a
[1:04:42] woman is a weaker vessel and because a
[1:04:46] woman is a weaker
[1:04:48] vessel all through
[1:04:51] centuries God has used women
[1:04:56] mightly in ways he has never used men
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:00] before if you stud your Bible you will
[1:05:05] Marvel I've just shown you one example
[1:05:08] here of Mary of
[1:05:11] Mary the angel did not
[1:05:14] come toist
[1:05:17] him there was a a
[1:05:20] church there was a high priest there
[1:05:23] were ministers there were other prophets
[1:05:27] but God bypassed all of them there were
[1:05:30] Kings God by Pastor all of them there
[1:05:33] was even a high priest who believed God
[1:05:38] cannot speak in his
[1:05:41] time not through
[1:05:43] him he thought God will only speak
[1:05:45] through
[1:05:47] him so I believe they had
[1:05:50] rumors that the angel came to a certain
[1:05:53] woman
[1:05:54] and say that you will have a
[1:05:56] child and the spirit will overshadow
[1:05:59] you and when the high priest may be had
[1:06:03] that just ignore
[1:06:06] ignore if it is God Why didn't it speak
[1:06:09] to me listen if you are still proud if
[1:06:14] you still think you are
[1:06:16] somebody God can never speak to
[1:06:20] you God does not deal with pride
[1:06:24] God deals with
[1:06:26] humility God deals with a soft
[1:06:29] heart a broken
[1:06:32] Spirit a contrite heart aant
[1:06:37] soul God deals with
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:41] such he says he has left all the the big
[1:06:44] things of the
[1:06:47] world and he revealed himself to
[1:06:53] babes and he said the kingdom of God is
[1:06:55] likened downto a little
[1:06:59] child for God and angels to visit
[1:07:03] you you need to be
[1:07:06] helpless you need to be in a place of
[1:07:11] weakness and here is Elizabeth and
[1:07:15] Zariah let us look at it in the Book of
[1:07:17] Luke chapter
[1:07:21] one I'll just read in English listen
[1:07:25] verse 12 and when Zachariah saw him he
[1:07:29] was troubled and fear fell upon him but
[1:07:32] the angel said unto him fear not
[1:07:34] Zacharias Zacharias for thy prayer is
[1:07:37] heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[1:07:39] the a son and thou shalt call his name
[1:07:42] John and thou shalt have joy and
[1:07:44] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[1:07:47] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[1:07:50] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:07:52] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[1:07:56] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[1:07:57] mother's womb and many of the children
[1:07:59] of Israel shall eat unto the Lord their
[1:08:01] God and they shall go before him in the
[1:08:03] spirit and power of Elias to turn the
[1:08:05] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:08:06] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:08:08] just to make ready a people prepared for
[1:08:10] the Lord and Zachariah said unto the
[1:08:15] angel whereby shall I know this for I am
[1:08:19] an old man and my wife well stricken in
[1:08:21] years what are you talking about angel

[1:08:47] to show thee these th Tidings and behold
[1:08:51] thou shal be dump and not able to speak

[1:09:02] season this is so touching to
[1:09:07] me here is an angel of the Lord that
[1:09:09] comes down to speak to a
[1:09:14] priest and the priest you would say is
[1:09:17] the best person to hear from

[1:09:30] everything listen the angel of the Lord

[1:15:52] in the days where in he looked on
[1:15:56] me to take away my among
[1:15:59] men I have a question for the church
[1:16:03] where did Elizabeth get these things
[1:16:05] from how did she not God dealt with
[1:16:09] her maybe God may not have said
[1:16:12] something but Elizabeth could sense the
[1:16:15] presence of
[1:16:18] God women sense the presence of God
[1:16:21] better than men
[1:16:26] oh God make all the men like
[1:16:29] that
[1:16:31] Hallelujah one one one day young man
[1:16:34] came to say Pastor can you imagine today

[1:16:48] opportunity to be weak and
[1:16:52] vulnerable
[1:16:55] Hallelujah Elizabeth elizeth she
[1:16:59] conceived and she began to give a
[1:17:02] testimony she wasn't there when the
[1:17:04] angel was
[1:17:05] speaking but that's just the
[1:17:08] beginning listen there is more
[1:17:11] sistera verse 59 and it came to pass
[1:17:15] that on the eth day they came to
[1:17:18] circumcise the child and they and and
[1:17:21] they called him Z
[1:17:25] after the name of his
[1:17:34] father the child shall be called
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:43] Zacharias Elizabeth was
[1:17:46] around and Elizabeth
[1:17:48] said what did you
[1:17:52] say
[1:17:55] he he shall be called
[1:17:59] John
[1:18:02] whaty what did you say Elizabeth what
[1:18:06] did you
[1:18:08] say were you there when
[1:18:10] Gabriel where did you get the
[1:18:13] name you remember that was the first
[1:18:15] point the second point the
[1:18:18] angel your wife shall have a boy and his
[1:18:20] name shall be John
[1:18:25] let me tell you a mystery the angel must
[1:18:27] have gone and told Elizabeth about this
[1:18:37] news and he made sure he made zakar
[1:18:42] dumb the one who shall declare the good
[1:18:46] news will be a
[1:18:48] believer the one God will speak
[1:18:51] to will be
[1:18:53] believer the one who the angels will
[1:18:56] appear
[1:18:57] to will be a weak
[1:19:00] person a real genuine believer of the
[1:19:06] supernatural hallelujah hallelujah said
[1:19:10] no her name is
[1:19:12] John and they said unto her what are you
[1:19:15] talking about woman there is no one in
[1:19:18] your among your family that are called
[1:19:21] by that name
[1:19:27] I love this
[1:19:29] church verse
[1:19:31] 6 and they made signs to his
[1:19:36] father so they went to
[1:19:39] Zacharias we want to know the name of
[1:19:42] the
[1:19:47] boy which means he couldn't even hear he
[1:19:49] couldn't
[1:19:51] talk if you refuse to hear God he will
[1:19:55] make you Dum and
[1:19:59] death spiritual
[1:20:02] speaking and that you will no longer
[1:20:04] hear
[1:20:05] him friends I want to always hear
[1:20:09] God when God speaks I want to
[1:20:12] hear I don't want to hear him the second
[1:20:14] time I want to hear him the first
[1:20:19] time and he made signs to his father
[1:20:22] tell us the name
[1:20:25] bring me that
[1:20:28] table and I bought the table he gave
[1:20:31] them the pen and he started
[1:20:37] writing
[1:20:40] John because he already had heard it
[1:20:42] from the angel you
[1:20:43] remember he already knew but because of
[1:20:46] unbelief allow him to say it
[1:20:49] f so God made him dump and when I
[1:20:54] brought a piece of paper and he wrote
[1:20:58] John everybody was
[1:21:01] like same
[1:21:03] name name like
[1:21:06] Elizabeth and immediately when he wrote
[1:21:09] it down that is a sign of faith it is a
[1:21:13] sign of faith God opened him
[1:21:16] up he said now you can speak now you can
[1:21:19] speak because you have accepted to be a
[1:21:22] place of
[1:21:25] weakness if you don't accept to be in a
[1:21:27] place of weakness God will never speak
[1:21:29] to
[1:21:32] you God speaks to you if you decide and
[1:21:35] accept to be a weak
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:39] vessel that's why our sisters in that
[1:21:42] are better than
[1:21:46] us God has always spoke to women better
[1:21:49] than
[1:21:51] men even in a home God speaks to the
[1:21:54] mother more than he speaks to the
[1:21:57] mother brother that's why you should
[1:22:00] love your
[1:22:02] wife love her so much because the more
[1:22:05] you love her the more she will tell you
[1:22:08] about her secret talks with the Lord
[1:22:14] Jesus my good Lord that is if you mared
[1:22:17] a
[1:22:20] Believer hallelujah oh my this is is so
[1:22:23] wonderful let me give you one one last
[1:22:25] example and then we
[1:22:27] close you will just read directly from
[1:22:29] me judges
[1:22:32] verse1 and the children of Israel did
[1:22:34] Evil again in the sight of the
[1:22:37] Lord the Lord delivered them into the
[1:22:39] hand of the
[1:22:42] Philistines and there was a certain man
[1:22:45] called a certain man of
[1:22:48] Zora of the family of the
[1:22:51] danites whose name was
[1:22:54] Mano and his wife was
[1:22:57] baren and bear
[1:22:59] not mm another story are you
[1:23:04] interested would you like to hear all
[1:23:07] right and the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:23:10] unto the
[1:23:12] woman and said to her behold now you are
[1:23:17] baren and you bear not but you shall
[1:23:21] conceive

[1:23:48] unto
[1:23:50] God from the womb and he shall begin to
[1:23:54] deliver Israel out of the hand of the
[1:23:59] Philistines many points so many
[1:24:02] points God the woman was
[1:24:08] listening was
[1:24:10] amen then the woman came and told her
[1:24:14] husband saying my my darling my dear
[1:24:18] husband a man of God came and to
[1:24:23] me and his continence was like the
[1:24:26] continence of an
[1:24:28] Angel very
[1:24:30] terrible but I asked him not when he
[1:24:35] was neither he told me his
[1:24:38] name but he said unto me behold thou sh
[1:24:43] conceive and bear a son and now now
[1:24:47] drink no
[1:24:49] wine no uh H strong drink
[1:24:53] neither eat an unclean thing for the
[1:24:55] child shall be a
[1:24:57] Nazarite to God from the womb to the day
[1:25:00] of his
[1:25:04] death have you heard I wanted you to say
[1:25:07] a point there before we
[1:25:08] continue the woman did not ask
[1:25:13] anything everything the angel said she
[1:25:15] just said amen
[1:25:17] amen she even forgot to ask the name of
[1:25:21] the
[1:25:22] and where you came from she just
[1:25:26] believed if it was the man let us
[1:25:30] see and her husband
[1:25:33] now when he had those things he went to
[1:25:37] pray he said Lord let let the man of God
[1:25:41] which thou did send come again unto
[1:25:46] us and teach us what we shall do unto
[1:25:48] the child that shall be
[1:25:51] born
[1:25:53] and Goden to the voice of
[1:25:56] man so you would think God would come
[1:25:58] and speak to
[1:26:04] man let us
[1:26:06] continue but the angel of God came
[1:26:09] again unto the
[1:26:13] woman as she sat in the
[1:26:16] field but man husband was not even with
[1:26:21] her
[1:26:23] oh my
[1:26:25] God and the woman made
[1:26:28] haste the moment she saw the angel she
[1:26:31] ran and she showed her husband and said
[1:26:34] unto him behold the man come back he has
[1:26:39] appeared to me again the one who came
[1:26:41] the other day and man arose and he went
[1:26:44] after his wife so the wife was
[1:26:48] running and and the man was
[1:26:51] following in spiritual things in
[1:26:54] spiritual
[1:26:57] things you need to work with your wife
[1:27:00] my
[1:27:03] dear because in because she's the weaker
[1:27:07] vessel God uses them so
[1:27:09] much in here she's
[1:27:12] leading man is
[1:27:14] following why because she can see what
[1:27:17] man cannot
[1:27:19] see she can hear what man cannot hear
[1:27:25] what let me take you take
[1:27:29] me now you you are very busy you want to
[1:27:31] marry a sex
[1:27:34] Queen how will she lead you to
[1:27:37] theel she will lead you to hell that's
[1:27:41] why when married
[1:27:42] Jezebel jeel L her
[1:27:47] to the woman with the spiritual
[1:27:51] things the woman is the one to build
[1:27:53] your home
[1:27:56] spiritually that's why he says a foolish
[1:27:58] woman will te her home
[1:28:02] with if you allow that Bo music in your
[1:28:08] home you allow your children to sleep
[1:28:10] without
[1:28:12] praying you allow your home not to have
[1:28:14] a
[1:28:16] family because you're not cooking in
[1:28:19] time and you're so tired
[1:28:22] and you're just sleeping without
[1:28:24] teaching your children how to
[1:28:27] pray your home is
[1:28:30] broken you have to lead the way as much
[1:28:34] as the man is the priest of the
[1:28:36] home the
[1:28:38] woman God has placed her there to help
[1:28:42] build that
[1:28:44] home and so we see
[1:28:47] here many times God loves speaking to
[1:28:49] women
[1:28:51] fast
[1:28:52] even my wife God spoke to her about me
[1:28:55] before I knew that I was supposed to
[1:28:57] marry
[1:29:00] her my wife always is
[1:29:03] shy when I say
[1:29:05] that because she like people will
[1:29:11] think but it is
[1:29:14] bibical
[1:29:16] gods that
[1:29:20] way listen
[1:29:22] notice
[1:29:23] here so she leades the
[1:29:27] way and uh and uh man said unto the
[1:29:31] angel now they have
[1:29:35] arrived okay which verse were we
[1:29:41] on verse 11 and
[1:29:45] said now let thy words come to
[1:29:50] pass first of all he ask he went after
[1:29:52] his wife and he came to the man and he
[1:29:55] said unto him Mr Angel tell me are you
[1:29:59] the man that spoke to the
[1:30:02] woman and the angel said I
[1:30:06] am and man said now let thy words come
[1:30:11] to
[1:30:12] pass how shall we order the
[1:30:16] child and how shall we do unto
[1:30:19] him imagine the man is asking many
[1:30:23] questions that's why God always comes to
[1:30:25] the woman because the woman doesn't have
[1:30:26] ask all questions the woman just
[1:30:28] believes be to me according to
[1:30:33] what in one second the man has already
[1:30:36] asked two
[1:30:37] questions and the angel of the Lord said
[1:30:40] unto
[1:30:41] man of all that I said unto the woman
[1:30:44] let her be
[1:30:47] aware you man what are you talking about
[1:30:50] I've already spoken to you your
[1:30:52] wife so whatever I've said to her let
[1:30:56] just be aware
[1:31:00] of praise God she may not eat of
[1:31:04] anything that cometh of the
[1:31:07] vine and blah blah blah and verse 15 and
[1:31:10] man said unto the
[1:31:12] angel I pray thee let us detain you
[1:31:16] here until we shall have made ready a
[1:31:19] kid for
[1:31:20] thee
[1:31:23] and the angel of the Lord
[1:31:25] said though thou detain
[1:31:28] me I will not eat of th bread and if
[1:31:32] thou offer a bur
[1:31:34] offering th must offer it unto the Lord
[1:31:37] for man knew not that he was an angel of
[1:31:39] the
[1:31:41] Lord and man said unto the angel of the
[1:31:45] Lord knew
[1:31:48] not I wonder whether the woman knew not
[1:31:53] who told the woman that this was a man
[1:31:54] of the
[1:31:57] Lord
[1:31:59] Revelation said unto the angel of the
[1:32:01] Lord what is thy
[1:32:03] name that when thy sayings come to
[1:32:06] pass we may do the
[1:32:09] honor the woman never asked the name
[1:32:12] this man is very busy us what is your
[1:32:16] name and the angel of the Lord said unto
[1:32:18] him why do you ask my name
[1:32:23] why what is wrong with
[1:32:25] you it is a secret I will not tell
[1:32:31] you the angel could not disclose nothing
[1:32:33] to the
[1:32:35] man everything the angel told the man is
[1:32:37] what he had already told the
[1:32:41] woman and he told the woman he told the
[1:32:44] man when the woman was
[1:32:48] there are you following me now but the
[1:32:52] angel of the Lord did
[1:32:53] not praise
[1:32:56] God so man took a kid with a meat
[1:33:00] offering and offered it upon a rock unto
[1:33:03] the Lord and the angel did
[1:33:06] wondrously and manoah and his wife
[1:33:09] looked
[1:33:11] on it came to pass when the flame went
[1:33:13] up toward
[1:33:15] Heaven from off the altar that the angel
[1:33:19] of the Lord ascended in the flame of
[1:33:23] and man and his wife looked on
[1:33:26] it and fell on their face
[1:33:29] ground but the angel of the Lord did no
[1:33:31] more appear to manoah and to his
[1:33:36] wife man knew that he was an angel of
[1:33:39] the
[1:33:41] Lord and man said unto his
[1:33:45] wife we shall surely die because we have
[1:33:49] seen God oh man
[1:33:52] what is wrong with
[1:33:55] men but his wife she said unto him if

[1:34:02] us he would not have received a burn
[1:34:05] offering and meat offering at
[1:34:08] our a weak
