[20:50] of Romans chapter
[20:57] 3
[21:01] [Music]
[21:04] Romans chapter 3:
[21:17] 10 I'm hoping that you
[21:20] are just trying to find it in my
[21:27] Bible

[21:36] 10 everybody there if you're there say
[21:39] [Music]
[21:42] Amen so let us pray before we
[21:47] read Lord Jesus we are we have a portion
[21:50] of scripture here that we are going to
[21:54] read there many Souls Lord

[22:00] talk
[22:03] about father I pray that you will take
[22:05] me out of the
[22:07] way consecrate me now I've waited on
[22:11] you and I expect you Lord that you will

[22:24] lips may you speak and may we be
[22:26] silent speak to us Lord let help us to
[22:31] open our
[22:32] hearts that we will all hear from
[22:35] you grant it Lord in Jesus
[22:39] name amen
[22:41] amen we are reading Romans 3:
[22:47] 10 as it is written there is none
[22:51] righteous no not
[22:55] [Music]
[22:56] one
[23:00] no I'd like us to take our seats for now
[23:03] and then we are going to continue
[23:05] reading from verse
[23:10] [Music]
[23:11] 21 and I pray that you give me your un
[23:14] divided attention
[23:19] tonight but now the righteousness of God
[23:22] without the law is manifested being
[23:25] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[23:36] so he begins by verse 10 where he says
[23:38] there is none righteous
[23:40] [Music]
[23:42] no and then he says but the
[23:44] righteousness of God without the law is
[23:53] manifested so according to our own
[23:57] righteousness
[24:00] there is none
[24:01] righteous not
[24:04] one but the righteousness of
[24:08] God has been
[24:13] manifested now this is the righteousness
[24:15] of God without the
[24:19] law being witnessed by the law and the
[24:23] prophets even the righteousness of God
[24:26] which is by faith of Jesus J Christ unto
[24:29] all and upon them that believe for there
[24:33] is no
[24:45] difference for all have sinned and come
[24:50] short of the glory of
[24:56] God being
[24:58] justified
[25:00] freely by his grace through the
[25:03] Redemption that is in Christ
[25:06] [Music]
[25:12] Jesus God has set forth to be approp
[25:16] appropiation through faith in his blood
[25:20] to declare his righteousness for the
[25:22] remission of sins that are passed
[25:25] through the forbearance of God to Clare
[25:28] I say at this time his
[25:31] righteousness that he might be just and
[25:34] the justifier of him which believeth in
[25:56] Jesus
[26:02] so when I'm speaking to evening light we
[26:04] usually do an
[26:08] hour I don't want to just be fast and
[26:13] you so I want you to prepare your mind
[26:15] and move with
[26:18] me and uh keep your thoughts
[26:21] together and even if you're streaming
[26:23] the
[26:24] service I'm sure that the Lord will
[26:26] minister to you and
[26:30] I have Labor to hear the mind to receive
[26:32] the mind of God for the service
[26:35] tonight convinced that uh I do not know
[26:39] how many but I'm convinced that this
[26:40] will be for someone
[26:45] tonight so I'm speaking on a subject
[26:48] false
[26:50] [Music]
[26:53] guilt false
[26:56] gu now we will try to rehearse a little
[26:59] bit of what we have read so we can get
[27:01] uh the the
[27:07] picture Romans
[27:09] 3 verse 10 says as it is written there
[27:13] is none
[27:17] righteous no not one but now the
[27:21] righteousness of
[27:26] God without the is
[27:30] manifested I want you to understand here
[27:32] is that no one is born
[27:36] righteous and no one that is born is
[27:41] righteous whether or not you have done
[27:43] something
[27:45] bad you may never have
[27:49] stolen told a lie or offended
[27:53] somebody but according to God according
[27:56] to the standard of
[28:00] God brother all of us are born
[28:05] sinful we actually born in sin the
[28:08] B so none is
[28:11] righteous tell your neighbor none is
[28:14] righteous tell your neighbor you are not
[28:18] righteous and you see if we to gaug on
[28:21] our own
[28:23] righteousness the scripture says that
[28:25] our righteousness is like Fe filthy
[28:30] rugs works of
[28:33] righteousness they are like filthy
[28:36] rugs before God and so there is nothing
[28:39] that you can ever
[28:41] do that will make you righteous before
[28:46] God that none of us is going to make it
[28:48] to Heaven because of our works of
[28:53] righteousness and so he emphasizes and
[28:56] he says there is none righteous no not
[29:02] one so whenever we talk about us
[29:05] believing in Holiness and believing in
[29:07] righteousness we are not really
[29:08] referring to our own Holiness and our
[29:10] own
[29:18] righteousness we are talking about his
[29:22] righte and this is what you need to
[29:24] attain in your
[29:26] life then he continues on and he says
[29:28] but now the righteousness of God without
[29:31] the law is
[29:38] manifested now the righteousness of God
[29:41] comes without the
[29:46] law being witnessed by the law and the
[29:50] prophets even the righteousness of God
[29:53] which is by
[29:56] faith right so the righteousness of God
[29:59] comes to you by faith in Jesus Christ
[30:06] Jesus by faith of Jesus
[30:11] Christ unto all and upon all them that
[30:18] believe so the only thing you need to do
[30:20] to attain his righteousness is
[30:26] believing says for all have
[30:29] seen and come short of the glory of
[30:33] God but you see continues on by saying
[30:36] being justified freely by his grace
[30:39] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[30:46] Jesus Hallelujah we have been Justified
[30:51] freely amen by his
[30:53] grace through faith and he says whom God
[30:57] has set forth to be appropriation
[30:59] through faith in his
[31:05] blood to declare his
[31:08] righteous so why did he shed his
[31:12] blood please follow me closely here he
[31:16] shed his
[31:17] blood so that he will
[31:21] declare his
[31:23] righteousness for the remission of
[31:26] sin that are
[31:29] passed I'm speaking on false
[31:34] guilt now if I would want to Define
[31:38] guilt is the fact of having committed a
[31:41] specified or an implied offense or
[31:52] crime or a
[31:55] crime guilt is the reason of having
[31:58] violated a specific rule or
[32:06] law in other words if you break a law or
[32:10] if you break a
[32:11] rule either by your
[32:15] Society your
[32:17] community the laws of
[32:20] God the cultural laws whatever it is
[32:23] moral laws when you break those laws and
[32:28] then you you become
[32:31] guilty so guilt comes out of breaking a
[32:37] law now when we we cross a moral like I
[32:41] said a moral or
[32:52] eth then you become
[32:56] guilty
[32:57] guilt is primarily a state or a
[33:04] condition it is not a
[33:07] feeling I repeat it is not a
[33:10] feeling it is a state or
[33:14] condition someone can actually be guilty
[33:17] and not feel that they are
[33:22] guilty and they don't feel it they just
[33:25] killed someone and they don't feel the
[33:29] tell to me it's all
[33:31] right it's not
[33:33] bad according to
[33:35] them because they don't feel their
[33:37] guilty they think they're
[33:40] safe someone can go ahead and and
[33:42] fornicate and say I don't feel condemned
[33:45] I don't feel
[33:48] guilty because he does not know the law
[33:51] of
[33:53] God and so someone can actually be
[33:56] guilty and not feel that they
[34:00] are it is also possible not to be guilty
[34:03] and then feel you are
[34:10] guilty and and according to
[34:13] scripture we are all guilty before
[34:17] God because God gave his
[34:21] word which is his law in the Book of
[34:24] Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 I read and
[34:29] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[34:31] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[34:33] freely
[34:36] eat but of the tree of the knowledge of
[34:39] Good and Evil thou sh not eat of
[34:44] it for in in the day that thou eest
[34:47] thereof thou sh surely
[34:50] die so now we see here after man broke
[34:54] the word or the law of God
[35:00] so then he knew he was
[35:03] guilty because the law or the word of
[35:06] God was previously given to
[35:12] him so many times people will sin but
[35:16] they do not know they are
[35:20] sinners actually a sinner out there is a
[35:22] sinner but they don't actually know or
[35:24] realize they are sinners and they need
[35:26] God or they need
[35:32] salvation but they don't know
[35:35] it that is because they do not know the
[35:39] word and that's why we preach the
[35:42] word because the word brings
[35:46] condemnation and when you feel you are
[35:49] guilty that feel transports you into
[35:54] repentance so man because he knew he
[35:57] previously had known the word of God or
[35:59] the law of
[36:02] God the moment he did what God told him
[36:05] not
[36:07] to he knew he was
[36:10] guilty and this was the introduction of
[36:12] guilt actually the first time to the
[36:14] human
[36:19] race man also got guilt feelings and you
[36:22] know and then he hid
[36:25] himself
[36:27] and I want you to see now God started
[36:30] right from the beginning to for shadow
[36:38] justification Genesis 3:
[36:42] 21 and to Adam and also to his wife did
[36:46] the Lord God make CS of skin and clothed
[36:54] them in Hebrews 9:12 says neither by the
[36:57] blood of gods and calves but by his own
[37:00] blood he entered in once into the holy
[37:09] place by his own
[37:12] blood he entered in once into the holy
[37:17] Place having obtained Eternal Redemption
[37:21] for
[37:24] us after man had sinned
[37:28] a man came to a place of
[37:31] guilt he was not only in a place of
[37:34] guilt but he also had guilt
[37:40] feelings so then man needed
[37:45] Redemption needed
[37:47] salvation and so then what he did he hid
[37:51] himself that is what we all do when we
[37:54] sin
[37:55] before our away from the presence of
[37:59] God and this is what I want to deal with
[38:01] this
[38:03] evening actually many people when they
[38:05] they feel they
[38:08] guilty you see the devil brings them
[38:10] this sense of guilt that they do not
[38:13] need to be in the presence of
[38:18] God they are
[38:21] unworthy they don't even they shouldn't
[38:22] even come before
[38:24] God you know sometimes even feel like I
[38:27] shouldn't even
[38:29] pray I shouldn't even you know
[38:32] sing because my mouth is unclean my
[38:35] hands and clean my feet I feel like
[38:38] worship is not for
[38:40] me I can't even sing a special song I
[38:43] can't do anything for
[38:44] the this is how Adam
[38:48] felt and Adam shed the presence of God
[38:52] and together with his wife they hid
[38:54] themselves but I want you to I want to
[38:57] show you the attitude of
[38:58] God down he did not come with the
[39:01] attitude of
[39:04] judgment he only wanted one thing from
[39:07] Adam and
[39:08] Eve he only wanted him Adam to realize
[39:12] and confess his
[39:17] guilt you know God had introduced guilt
[39:20] or sin rather had introduced guilty to
[39:23] the human
[39:25] race
[39:27] you know sin introduce guilt into the
[39:29] human into the human
[39:34] race that God can use it as a
[39:38] policeman to bring this
[39:41] man back to God to bring him from sin
[39:45] back to
[39:47] God but I want to show you this
[39:49] evening devil TT the some
[39:53] something and he wants to use it to take
[39:57] man out of the presence of
[40:00] God guilt is not supposed to take us
[40:03] away from God's
[40:05] presence but it's supposed to take us
[40:07] into the presence of
[40:09] God Amen whereby Adam came and he he
[40:13] confessed he said yes I've done
[40:16] it God said have you eaten the
[40:20] fruit of the tree that I told you not to
[40:23] eat did God know or he did not know
[40:28] knew but why did he ask he wanted to
[40:31] hear Adam
[40:33] sayam had to
[40:36] say if you've done something and is
[40:38] condemning you you have to come before
[40:40] the presence of God and
[40:45] say that is called
[40:48] confession and some confessions are done
[40:50] in public others are done in private
[40:52] others are done to individuals others
[40:54] are done just before you and go
[41:03] if do not do that then that feeling will
[41:08] make you run away from the presence of
[41:12] God and so what was the attitude of
[41:17] God when God came down he did not begin
[41:19] judging
[41:21] Adam the moment Adam confessed his
[41:25] sin the moment Adam
[41:28] confesses God quickly went and killed a
[41:32] lamb and he brought CS of
[41:35] skins and closed them and in Hebrews 9
[41:39] he
[41:39] says neither by the blood of God or the
[41:43] blood of but by his own
[41:46] blood now what listen Church what God
[41:49] did in the
[41:51] beginning was only foreshadowing what he
[41:53] would do later thousands of years later
[41:58] god listen why did God kill gods and
[42:02] Lambs why did he kill Gods God got to to
[42:05] remove the
[42:07] Skins he was just showing in the
[42:11] future I'm going to shed
[42:13] blood amen my own
[42:16] blood in order for you to be
[42:19] redeemed Adam as long as you have
[42:21] confessed your
[42:22] sin I'm going to redeem you my own
[42:27] blood because your blood is
[42:30] sinful your lineage is sinful but I am a
[42:34] perfect
[42:35] God I am Holy and I will have a holy
[42:40] generation that's why the Bible says I
[42:42] am Holy you holy as I am
[42:46] Holy now there he doesn't talk about
[42:49] your
[42:50] Holiness oh my I wish you would see this
[42:52] tonight he's talking about his holiness
[42:57] but he says be ye
[42:59] holy even as I am Holy he's not pointing
[43:03] to your
[43:04] Holiness he's not pointing to your
[43:07] righteousness he's pointing to his
[43:10] Holiness amen that's why he said by his
[43:13] own
[43:14] blood he entered him once into the holy
[43:19] place and having obtained Eternal
[43:22] Redemption for
[43:25] us
[43:27] Eternal
[43:29] Redemption if God ever redeemed
[43:33] anyone he redeemed them
[43:36] eternally he redeemed them to a point
[43:38] that he can never lose them
[43:42] again let me tell you if I've been
[43:44] redeemed once I've been redeemed
[43:48] forever if been saved was have been Saed
[43:52] forever oh praise the name of the Lord
[43:56] you know the act of shedding blood of
[43:57] animals and and and clothing Adam and
[43:59] Eve was just a
[44:06] shadow God showed what he would do to
[44:08] remove the guilt of
[44:11] sin whoever would receive the perfect
[44:16] sacrifice amen guilt would
[44:19] leave and guilt would leave them
[44:24] permanently and we are the beneficial of
[44:29] that in John
[44:32] 1:12 are I'm just trying to lay down
[44:35] some simple but very strong facts of our
[44:44] faith but as many as received
[44:47] him to them gave he power to become the
[44:50] sons of
[44:51] God and so when I hear that I hear that
[44:55] this way
[44:56] because I received him he gave me power
[44:59] to become a Son of
[45:01] God even to them that believe on his
[45:05] name which were born not of
[45:08] blood nor of the will of the flesh not
[45:12] of the will of
[45:13] man but of
[45:16] God and and and you know the moment I
[45:18] was born
[45:20] again I ceas to be a son of my
[45:24] father things that were following my
[45:27] father's
[45:29] lineage were cut off that
[45:32] moment and then now the things that were
[45:34] following my new father's
[45:37] lineage amen I was joined to them for
[45:40] that
[45:41] moment and so what is my real
[45:44] lineage amen I come from God I go back
[45:47] to
[45:48] God I was not born of blood I was born I
[45:51] was not born of the wheel of the
[45:53] flesh I was not born of the wheel of my
[45:56] father but I was born of God Amen I was
[46:00] born according to a new
[46:02] convenant amen now I am joined onto a
[46:05] new
[46:06] blood his blood vein his blood amen
[46:10] flows through my
[46:12] veins why because I received him he gave
[46:16] me power to become his
[46:18] son so today I am a Son of
[46:21] God in John 3:16 he says for God so
[46:24] loved the world
[46:27] that he gave his only begotten son that
[46:30] whosoever believeth in him should not
[46:33] perish but have everlasting
[46:36] life for God sent not his son into the
[46:39] world to condemn the
[46:43] world but that the world through him
[46:46] might be
[46:49] saved why did he come to the
[46:52] world he did not come to show us how
[46:55] guilty we
[46:57] [Music]
[46:58] are because for sure we are
[47:01] guilty we guilty in our mind our
[47:05] conscience we are guilty in our body we
[47:08] are guilty in our words we
[47:10] speak but for God so loved the
[47:14] world that he gave his only begotten son
[47:18] that whosoever
[47:20] believeth so the only thing you have to
[47:22] do is to
[47:23] believe whosoever believeth
[47:26] Amen in him should not perish but have
[47:29] eternal
[47:31] life but for he says for God did not
[47:33] send his son to
[47:37] condemn Jesus did not come to condemn
[47:40] me amen but he came that I might be
[47:44] saved through
[47:45] him so in other words the message of the
[47:49] Cross or even the end time message as we
[47:52] call
[47:54] it not a message of
[47:58] condemnation it is a message of
[48:01] Salvation it is a message of
[48:03] hope it's a me it's a Guiltless
[48:07] message has come to Amen to declare to
[48:10] us that we are
[48:12] Guiltless amen we are no more
[48:15] guilty we are no more sinful we are
[48:19] redeemed we are saved now this is not
[48:23] what I said is what he said in his
[48:27] just follow me closely Romans 109 that
[48:31] if thou sh confess with thy mouth the
[48:34] Lord
[48:34] [Music]
[48:36] Jesus and Shall Believe in th
[48:39] heart that God has raised him from the
[48:44] dead Thou shalt be
[48:47] saved
[48:48] simple for with the
[48:51] heart man
[48:53] believe you may say I believe with your
[48:55] mouth
[48:58] that's not what we're talking
[48:59] about we are talking about the heart
[49:02] with the
[49:03] heart man
[49:05] believeth unto
[49:09] right and with a
[49:11] mouth confession is made unto
[49:14] salvation for the scripture say
[49:16] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[49:20] ashamed this goes for anything that you
[49:23] have done in your life
[49:26] amen if you believe in your
[49:29] heart having heard the word of God and
[49:32] you believe that Jesus Christ's blood
[49:34] washes away every
[49:37] sin after you repent of any
[49:40] sin the moment you you repent of it you
[49:44] must believe it in your
[49:46] heart and you must believe that him and
[49:48] his blood washes you
[49:52] per as though you never did it in the
[49:54] first place
[49:57] and after you confess it believe that
[50:00] you are washed away
[50:01] from believe that you are saved believe
[50:05] that you are
[50:05] clean so in other words it begins by
[50:09] hearing from hearing it comes to
[50:12] believing in the heart after believing
[50:15] in the heart then it comes to confessing
[50:17] the mouth so you said how many believe
[50:20] here that you are
[50:22] saved how did it start with your ears
[50:27] amen I'm saved you know when he were
[50:29] telling you preaching to you the gospel
[50:31] you accepted it you believed it and then
[50:35] you said what can I do and then they
[50:37] said you be baptized in the name of
[50:39] Jesus Christ and you did it right away
[50:43] now you
[50:45] believe that you are saved and you tell
[50:48] your heart every day I am a believer I
[50:52] am saved I am a believer I'm saved
[50:56] and now you confess with your mouth not
[50:58] only in your heart you take it from your
[51:01] heart and you confess it I'm a believer
[51:04] I'm a Believer I am saved I'm a Believer
[51:07] you know you believe it and because you
[51:10] believe it the devil cannot rob it away
[51:13] from
[51:14] you in the same way if you have ever
[51:18] done something
[51:19] wrong did you know it works like magic
[51:24] it works even more than
[51:26] the moment he KNE before God and he said
[51:29] Lord I'm sorry for my that very moment
[51:33] the blood of Jesus washes your sins away
[51:37] that very moment you are cleansed and
[51:40] you are set
[51:42] free and you are no longer
[51:44] guilty according to
[51:47] God now he has already done everything
[51:49] to remove the
[51:51] guilt our only part is to believe him
[51:56] and to believe in his finished
[51:58] work now I want I want you to see here
[52:01] the difference between Godly guilt and
[52:03] World
[52:09] gift the book of second Corinthians
[52:13] 710 it says for go Godly sorrow work
[52:16] repentance to
[52:21] Salvation the word Sor there you can
[52:23] replace it for guilt
[52:31] to be repented of to Salvation not okay
[52:34] for Godly sorrow WTH repentance to
[52:36] Salvation not to be repented of but the
[52:39] sorrow of the world WTH
[52:42] death we are in 2 Corinthians 7:
[52:47] [Music]
[52:50] 10 can we give you a moment better be
[52:53] faster have a little time
[53:19] now I want to explain this and expound
[53:21] it for you
[53:24] tonight feelings are
[53:28] [Music]
[53:30] good when they lead you to
[53:35] repentance but the devil can also use
[53:37] these feelings to drive you away from
[53:44] Godly guilt has
[53:49] hopelessness
[53:51] hopelessness
[53:53] condemnation disappointment
[53:57] disillusionment you feel you
[53:59] disappointed in
[54:02] yourself you feel your
[54:04] hopeless some of you you look back and
[54:06] see the things you
[54:09] did and then you begin comparing
[54:11] yourself with
[54:13] others and you say me I'm I'm I'm so bad
[54:16] so bad I'm so bad but remember you
[54:20] repented of those
[54:21] things and those things are under the
[54:24] blood it is a sin for you to refer to
[54:27] those sins
[54:29] anymore because anything that is under
[54:32] the blood is not be remembered by God
[54:34] Amen the moment is confessed and
[54:42] repented and and so wildly guilt of the
[54:45] guilt of the
[54:48] world it shows you that you are
[54:51] bad and and nothing you can do to make
[54:55] you good
[54:58] enough it show you cannot be
[55:01] accepted even in your mind you say when
[55:03] you look at yourself you feel I'm so
[55:08] bad there is nothing good in me I've
[55:10] done only mistakes in my
[55:14] life sometimes you sit down in a corner
[55:16] and You Begin judging
[55:19] yourself oh I did this I did that I did
[55:22] this I did
[55:23] that can never
[55:26] redeemed am so bad I can no longer be
[55:29] good
[55:30] enough and you find a person that was
[55:33] really so
[55:35] good but because of this self
[55:39] condemnation because of this guilt that
[55:42] they apply upon themselves they can
[55:45] never break through
[55:49] complexes they would just be as if
[55:51] they're beaten by
[55:53] rain they long feel free to worship
[55:57] God they be as though they are
[56:00] bound you can literally look at a person
[56:02] and see that they have chains around
[56:08] them not chains placed there by
[56:11] [Music]
[56:12] God not placed by the
[56:15] world not even placed by the
[56:18] devil self applied
[56:23] chains and this is what I called false
[56:28] guilt it shows you you are bad and
[56:30] nothing you can do to make you good
[56:34] [Music]
[56:36] enough you know worldly sorrow or
[56:39] worldly guilt will make you have a bad
[56:41] attitude toward
[56:47] God it will make you feel that God is so
[56:49] big and God Is So
[56:52] holy and you are so bad and you
[56:56] and God can never forgive you even your
[56:59] prayers cannot be
[57:00] heard what are you praying now why are
[57:03] you even going to
[57:05] church quit going to church you are not
[57:08] so good you are not important you are
[57:11] sinful you know guilt will play with
[57:15] you and will begin to refer to things
[57:17] that you know you
[57:21] did and you also know you did and you
[57:25] tell you for example see this and this
[57:28] how can you even go and begin saying
[57:30] [Music]
[57:31] amen when you know you did this and this
[57:35] and that's why when you see people
[57:36] seated in
[57:38] church cold like
[57:40] ice they can't even thereare say one
[57:44] amen many times it's because of this
[57:47] false
[57:50] guilt theil is telling them you're not
[57:52] good
[57:53] enough God speaks to you you want to say
[57:56] amen and the devil tells you shut
[57:59] up you cannot say Amen because you a
[58:03] sinner because you are so bad amen is
[58:06] for the holy
[58:07] ones but I'm here to tell you that that
[58:10] is called false
[58:12] guilt that is not true guilt that's the
[58:16] devil trying to
[58:18] pervert Wordly sorrow or guilt clouds
[58:21] your
[58:23] head
[58:25] it clouds your head and gives you no way
[58:29] back to
[58:31] Redemption you feel you are
[58:34] enclosed you feel you are overcome by
[58:37] these thoughts of
[58:41] condemnation but that's not the way God
[58:45] works when God found
[58:47] Adam not tell him Adam you are
[58:51] sinful you are so
[58:53] bad trusted you I did this for you I you
[58:59] the whole world what have you
[59:01] done but what did he do the moment Adam
[59:05] confessed his
[59:07] roong God went to a to
[59:10] Redemption Redemption is the answer of
[59:12] Godly
[59:16] guilt praise the name of the Lord give
[59:20] for the
[59:22] unbeliever let me let's talk a little
[59:24] bit about the guilt for the
[59:29] unbeliever before God John 3 ver
[59:34] 18 He that believeth on him is not
[59:39] condemned but he that believeth
[59:42] not so you see it's all about
[59:46] believing what do you believe what do
[59:49] you believe what do you believe right
[59:51] now do you believe you are saved do you
[59:54] believe your the Holy Ghost do you
[59:55] believe you're a child of God what do
[59:57] you believe do you believe you an
[1:00:00] overcomer do you believe you are walking
[1:00:02] out of that
[1:00:03] situation do you believe you are going
[1:00:04] to serve God do you believe you're going
[1:00:07] in the Rapture do you believe you're
[1:00:09] filled with the Holy Ghost you believe
[1:00:12] the blood of
[1:00:13] Jesus has been applied to you and all
[1:00:17] your sins are forgiven forgotten by
[1:00:20] God if you believe that then you will
[1:00:24] not
[1:00:26] condemned in other words you will not
[1:00:28] have
[1:00:30] guilt he that believeth
[1:00:33] not he that refuses to
[1:00:36] believe is condemned
[1:00:40] already because he has not believed in
[1:00:42] the name of the only begotten
[1:00:46] son and this is the
[1:00:49] condemnation that light is coming to the
[1:00:52] world and love
[1:00:55] Darkness rather than the
[1:00:58] light because their deeds were
[1:01:01] evil many times I've seen unbelieving
[1:01:05] friends you know they came to me and

[1:01:51] report we have believed his blood we
[1:01:56] have believed that he has washed and
[1:01:58] cleansed us we have believed we are more
[1:02:01] than conquer we are believed we are
[1:02:05] saved and the world is not our
[1:02:09] portion but they choose not to believe
[1:02:12] they choose to remain a
[1:02:14] sinner even when they
[1:02:16] guilty that guilt is supposed to drive
[1:02:20] them to
[1:02:22] God you see if you're not a beli

[1:10:35] Justified it means you never did it in
[1:10:39] the first
[1:10:43] place hallu this is my message to the

[1:12:17] first place
[1:12:20] hallelujah what about when we stumble
[1:12:23] and fall
[1:12:25] first John
[1:12:26] 1:9 if we confess our
[1:12:30] sins he is the is
[1:12:33] faithful and is just to forgive our sins
[1:12:38] and to cleanse us from all
[1:12:42] unrighteous it doesn't if you're in
[1:12:45] Christ all your sins are taken care
[1:12:50] of are you hearing me all everything is
[1:12:53] taken care
[1:12:54] of because if even if when you stumble
[1:12:57] and
[1:12:58] fall if you
[1:13:00] confess what you have done before
[1:13:03] him he has said he is
[1:13:07] faithful faithfulness
[1:13:09] mean you can count on
[1:13:13] him faithfulness means he's
[1:13:17] Dependable I've seen too many people
[1:13:21] feel guilty to the extent they lose
[1:13:25] their fire for
[1:13:29] God because of a little fult a little
[1:13:31] failure
[1:13:33] somewhere let me tell you brother sister
[1:13:35] if you're listening to me tonight leave
[1:13:37] your sins for the blood to
[1:13:40] cover be on fire for
[1:13:43] God don't let anything pull you
[1:13:46] down amen if you you stum and fall amen
[1:13:50] confess your
[1:13:52] sins he's
[1:13:54] faithful and he's
[1:13:56] just to give Amen to forgive our
[1:14:01] sins praise
[1:14:03] God cleans us from all
[1:14:07] unrighteous so that he can make us
[1:14:11] right so then what is false
[1:14:16] gu many
[1:14:18] Believers struggle with false
[1:14:22] guil and that's why we have believers
[1:14:25] who are not committed to
[1:14:29] service they are not committed to God
[1:14:33] fully because they're feeling
[1:14:37] guilty are you hearing me they're
[1:14:40] feeling
[1:14:41] guilty and when you feel
[1:14:44] guilty you cannot dedicate yourself to
[1:14:47] the service of
[1:14:49] God because then you're feeling
[1:14:52] unworthy
[1:14:56] they are
[1:14:57] forgiven and yet they still feel
[1:15:01] guilty they are burried in
[1:15:06] guilt guilt is all over
[1:15:10] them mind and
[1:15:13] heart even when you
[1:15:16] sleep you
[1:15:17] dream when you are uh you know going
[1:15:21] snakes are chasing after you
[1:15:24] because your
[1:15:26] conscience is not
[1:15:28] clean your conscience is filled with
[1:15:32] guilt even when you sleep you you are
[1:15:36] the one who will dream people chasing
[1:15:38] after you with
[1:15:41] my you always be wondering whether you
[1:15:44] being Beed or
[1:15:46] not because you are filled with
[1:15:50] guilt and I'm saying that is false guilt
[1:15:56] people they know that God has forgiven
[1:15:59] them but they cannot forgive
[1:16:03] themselves yeah I know they would even
[1:16:05] tell you I know I prayed that women
[1:16:07] confess know my sins are under the
[1:16:10] blood I know God has forgiven
[1:16:13] me but I can't forgive
[1:16:16] myself Des spite of their
[1:16:19] repentance they continue to beat
[1:16:21] themselves up
[1:16:24] and they actually think by doing that
[1:16:27] they are
[1:16:30] humble but you will actually see shortly
[1:16:32] that that is
[1:16:34] pride the devil
[1:16:36] speaks and he tells you you don't
[1:16:38] deserve full
[1:16:42] Pard you don't deserve
[1:16:44] full you a hypocrite you are a sinner
[1:16:48] youve done so many bad things you are so
[1:16:51] bad you don't God has has forgiven you
[1:16:54] but not
[1:16:55] completely God does not forgive
[1:16:59] halfway now let me tell you something
[1:17:01] else God when he forgives you of your
[1:17:05] sin he now even protects you from the
[1:17:08] after effects
[1:17:17] of he protects
[1:17:19] you from the hand of the div
[1:17:24] he protects you from your
[1:17:26] enemies we find many people they've done
[1:17:30] things and now they they've repented and
[1:17:33] now someone tells them if if if you you
[1:17:36] leave
[1:17:37] this I'm going to do this to you they
[1:17:40] begin blackmailing them and then they
[1:17:42] begin fear okay I know God has forgiven
[1:17:45] me but if I I I I if I don't do what
[1:17:48] this person is
[1:17:50] say I'm I'm finished you are not
[1:17:54] finished as long as you s you confessed
[1:17:56] and
[1:17:58] prop God will fight for
[1:18:02] you I actually believe and I'm convinced
[1:18:04] that this message is for someone or some
[1:18:06] people
[1:18:10] tonight work
[1:18:14] to I am not going to do what you're
[1:18:17] telling me
[1:18:18] to I am a child of God said no you did
[1:18:22] this no I did
[1:18:24] I am who I am and I know who I
[1:18:27] am you know the devil will speak to you
[1:18:31] God wants you to prove how sorry you
[1:18:34] are because you know you caused it you
[1:18:37] made it happen some of you even are
[1:18:40] guilty for things that have happened in
[1:18:41] other people's
[1:18:45] lives and you are so
[1:18:47] guilty someone dies and you I caused it
[1:18:50] to
[1:18:51] happen
[1:18:53] I cause it to
[1:18:56] happen I cause it to
[1:18:58] happen let me tell you you cause nothing
[1:19:00] to
[1:19:01] Happ every human being is a free moral
[1:19:05] agent and decisions they make they're
[1:19:07] responsible for
[1:19:09] them and if you made a decision to serve
[1:19:13] God and to confess the repent of your
[1:19:16] sins you are not responsible for
[1:19:20] them you are not guilty
[1:19:23] I am here to announce to you you are not
[1:19:26] guilty in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:19:29] are not
[1:19:30] guilty you are not the devil will tell
[1:19:33] you you are not worthy of God's
[1:19:36] grace and therefore you must punish
[1:19:39] yourself until he become
[1:19:41] better you know the devil the devil
[1:19:44] leaves you know to many people to think
[1:19:48] that by actually hanging onto their
[1:19:51] sins
[1:19:55] they're being
[1:19:56] humble and I want to say that is
[1:19:58] actually
[1:19:59] pride
[1:20:01] humility accepts
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:05] pardon pardon it can never
[1:20:09] ear and humility lives to demonstrate
[1:20:13] that
[1:20:19] gratefulness but if you refuse to be
[1:20:21] forgiven
[1:20:23] you are
[1:20:24] proud Pride thinks God may have forgiven
[1:20:28] you but your standard is make is is
[1:20:30] higher
[1:20:36] [Music]
[1:20:38] standard your standard actually is
[1:20:40] higher than
[1:20:42] God's God forgive you but you need to
[1:20:45] punish
[1:20:48] yourself what I did is so bad what I did
[1:20:50] so bad Pride makes you feel the
[1:20:54] sacrifice on the cross is sufficient to
[1:20:56] cover people's sins but not
[1:21:05] yours so we think we can actually help
[1:21:08] Jesus to pay for the Sacrifice by
[1:21:10] punishing
[1:21:15] ourselves you think you have to C your
[1:21:18] shame until you decide the sacrifice has
[1:21:20] been fully
[1:21:21] paid
[1:21:26] this is false
[1:21:28] guilt clinging to eat suggest that the
[1:21:31] blood of Jesus is not
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:37] enough but I want to tell you tonight
[1:21:40] finish amen when Jesus forgave you and
[1:21:44] announced it by his
[1:21:45] word said you
[1:21:48] Justified you are
[1:21:50] Justified that means ific NF
[1:21:57] guilt let me even tell you he justified
[1:22:00] you before you were even
[1:22:03] born so you even knew the things you
[1:22:06] were going to
[1:22:07] do he even knew the bad things you're
[1:22:09] going to
[1:22:11] beol and he forgave you before you even
[1:22:14] repented and he wased you before you
[1:22:16] even
[1:22:17] conf and anybody that tells you you need
[1:22:21] to punish yourself
[1:22:23] you need to you know go through this
[1:22:24] process they are a liar because when God
[1:22:28] forgives you one time forgave you
[1:22:32] forever and that is false guilt don't
[1:22:36] let FAL guilt false guilt hinder you
[1:22:39] from serving
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:42] God praise the name of the Lord I'll
[1:22:46] finish with this
[1:22:47] quot why is it that so many Christians
[1:22:49] find it so hard to live the Christian
[1:22:51] Life
[1:22:57] and this is the reason
[1:22:59] why because of false
[1:23:02] guilt the prophet of God says take away
[1:23:05] all guilt and
[1:23:09] condemnation take all the guilt away and
[1:23:13] May from this very
[1:23:14] day he says may the Holy Spirit of love
[1:23:18] joy peace and
[1:23:21] meekness Gent and
[1:23:24] patience set into every heart
[1:23:29] here Lord as your servant I intercede
[1:23:31] for this group with all my
[1:23:35] heart I offer you this fruit of the
[1:23:39] sermon this is the thing that I am

[1:24:01] each May the Holy Spirit melt down cold
[1:24:04] touched
[1:24:08] in May every root of bitterness be
[1:24:10] grabbed out by God's sharp

[1:24:18] things he give you the Fruit of the
[1:24:21] Spirit peace love joy

[1:24:33] because of
[1:24:35] that God bless

[1:24:43] my faith looks up to
[1:24:50] the oh thank you Lord
[1:24:53] I think we'll need to pray so we can
