[9:16] We are desiring to see you, Lord.
[9:20] To see you in your beauty, to see you in

[9:26] Lord, just come down even in the hearts
[9:29] of those that are ailing. Lord, we've
[9:31] had a prayer request here,
[9:37] the mother of Sister Winnie,
[9:40] the hospital at this time.
[9:43] Lord, we remember her
[9:45] especially not only the healing of our
[9:47] body but also the healing of our soul.
[9:50] [singing]
[9:51] Lord, let your spirit, Lord, in
[9:53] agreement together with my brothers and
[9:55] sisters here, [music] we pray for her
[9:56] that your spirit will go in the hospital

[10:01] a mighty way.
[10:09] Father, may you cause a healing, Lord.
[10:13] in our body and soul
[10:16] for your name's glory.
[10:18] We commit this service to you now.
[10:22] The reading and the preaching of your
[10:23] word, Lord,
[10:25] in Jesus name.
[10:28] Amen. Amen.
[10:38] again.
[10:45] [music]
[10:54] Send you [singing and music]
[11:00] [singing]
[11:06] [singing]
[11:10] may raise
[11:19] [singing]
[11:29] Yes.
[11:31] [singing]
[11:40] Yes. Do
[11:42] Green
[11:46] [singing]
[11:51] [singing]
[11:59] [music]
[12:02] [singing]
[12:05] [music]
[12:11] [singing]
[12:12] Yes.
[12:16] [singing]
[12:22] Yes.
[12:26] [singing]
[12:31] Jesus
[12:34] name [singing]
[12:38] [music]
[12:45] [music and singing]
[12:52] you praise and
[12:56] praise.
[12:56] [music]
[13:01] Amen. Why don't you take your Bibles at
[13:03] this time?
[13:06] I want to greet every one of you in the
[13:08] precious name of our Lord Jesus.
[13:14] I don't know the deacons. Can you help
[13:16] me make sure there is no seat in front?
[13:24] If you have a seat in front of you,
[13:25] please take it.
[13:30] Anyone who has a seat in front of him,
[13:32] you are in the wrong place.
[13:38] All right. God bless you. Please, please
[13:44] don't don't fear to be near the fire.
[13:52] Have we come to hear from the Lord this
[13:54] morning?
[13:57] So we are not afraid to be close.
[14:01] Amen. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them
[14:03] God bless you.
[14:06] Are you ready to hear from the Lord?
[14:13] While we are still standing, I'll just
[14:15] ask you to go to the book of Mark,
[14:16] chapter 9.
[14:27] Most of our students have gone back to
[14:30] school.
[14:36] So, schools have resumed.
[14:40] But I was glad that at least we had a
[14:42] youth convention before the schools
[14:43] started.
[14:50] It was a a good timing.
[14:55] So we are going to take Mark chapter 9
[14:57] verse 38.
[15:06] We are going to read only two um three
[15:08] verses and then we shall sit and then
[15:10] read the rest later.
[15:21] Okay. So I'll read. And John answered
[15:24] and answered him, saying, Master, we saw
[15:28] one casting out devils in thy name, and
[15:32] he followth not us. And we forbid him
[15:35] because he followeth not us. And Jesus
[15:39] said, "Forbid him not, for there is no
[15:42] man which shall do a miracle in my name
[15:46] that can lightly speak evil of me. For
[15:49] he that is not against us is on our
[15:52] part.
[16:25] Amen. Let us uh first pray again.
[16:28] Lord Jesus,
[16:31] We just humbly ask you to come at this
[16:33] time Lord and honor this meeting Lord by
[16:35] your presence.
[16:41] Lord we are unworthy in ourselves.
[16:45] We just depending on you to come and
[16:47] speak to us.
[16:50] You know what your people need, Lord.
[16:53] You know what you've laid on my heart.
[16:57] Take it Lord and divide it to each heart
[16:59] here as according to the need
[17:04] Lord. Even whoever that might see or be
[17:06] streaming or see this later Lord that
[17:08] you will speak to them.
[17:14] We just need your presence Lord.
[17:17] Father we ask this in Jesus name.
[17:21] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[17:25] So to our friends uh brethren who are
[17:27] joining us for the first time we want to
[17:29] say you are welcome feel free to feel
[17:32] feel at home.
[17:38] Is that brother Ivan
[17:41] to see you. God bless you.
[17:43] Amen. You're welcome back.
[17:46] You're welcome back to your home.
[17:51] Amen. brother here I think. Are you with
[17:53] your family?
[17:56] Oh yes. God bless you. We happy to
[17:59] fellowship with you today.
[18:02] Amen. Amen.
[18:04] And our sister you said you are not a
[18:05] visa. I think your face is also not very
[18:07] new but
[18:12] so this morning I'm speaking on uh uh
[18:16] something that the Lord has laid on my
[18:18] heart.
[18:22] And I pray that God will be able to take
[18:23] it, divide it, and put it into each of
[18:26] our hearts.
[18:31] So I'm going to speak on recognizing
[18:33] your place.
[18:38] But the my inspiration is jealousy at
[18:41] the altar.
[18:46] So I'm going to request little movement
[18:48] as much as possible.
[18:52] You try to be in that seat at least
[18:54] until the end of the preaching.
[18:59] Amen. So that the Lord will speak to
[19:01] you.
[19:03] How many are expecting from the Lord?
[19:06] Amen. So jealousy at the altar.
[19:12] Now here we know that in this church
[19:17] in this church
[19:20] is that hard to interpret?
[19:21] No.
[19:24] I've said many times that we are not a
[19:27] church.
[19:31] I've said many times that we are a
[19:33] fellowship
[19:37] of a main church.
[19:41] Jesus does not have two, three, four,
[19:44] five churches.
[19:47] And so really what I'm going to preach
[19:49] today is more of instructional and maybe
[19:52] a little bit more putting a few things
[19:54] in order.
[20:00] It's not one of those uh sermons I've
[20:04] been preaching in the past. So I want
[20:05] you to listen carefully.
[20:10] So that this church
[20:13] that Jesus has
[20:15] is one church.
[20:19] How many believe that
[20:22] Jesus does not have two, three, four,
[20:24] five churches?
[20:28] Jesus has only one church
[20:31] and that is the church we we sing about
[20:33] called the church triumphant
[20:38] and that church is what Jesus said he
[20:40] has built on the rock
[20:45] that is the revelation of himself
[20:49] that church is built upon the revelation
[20:51] of who Jesus is
[20:56] and that is one church. It is a
[20:59] worldwide church.
[21:02] There is members of that church in every
[21:05] part of the world.
[21:09] Wherever you go, you will find members
[21:11] of that church.
[21:15] We don't join that church by water
[21:17] baptism.
[21:21] We don't join that church by shaking of
[21:23] the hand of the pastor.
[21:28] We don't join that church by registering
[21:30] on a church book.
[21:35] We don't join that church by paying our
[21:37] tithe
[21:41] to that church. Actually, we are members
[21:44] of that church not by joining it.
[21:49] We are members of that church by being
[21:52] born into it.
[21:56] JUST LIKE YOU WERE born into your family
[21:59] by a birth.
[22:02] In the same way, we are born into that
[22:05] family by a birth,
[22:09] BY A SPIRITUAL BIRTH
[22:11] OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. The moment you
[22:14] receive the Holy Spirit in your soul,
[22:18] you are a member of that church.
[22:21] Now, WHEN THE WHEN JESUS CHRIST COMES,
[22:25] He is going to come and rapture members
[22:27] of that church.
[22:32] ONLY MEMBERS OF THAT CHURCH.
[22:36] AMEN. AMEN. Now the members of that
[22:39] church remember ARE SCATTERED ALL OVER
[22:40] THE WORLD.
[22:44] They in every place on earth.
[22:47] And the MEMBERS OF THAT CHURCH
[22:50] CAN RECEIVE THE FULL WORD OF GOD.
[22:54] THE MEMBERS OF OUR CHURCH WILL BE HOLY
[22:57] GHOST filled and holy ghost led.
[23:01] THEY WILL HAVE OVERCOME SIN.
[23:04] THEY WILL HAVE THE CHARACTER OF JESUS
[23:06] CHRIST.
[23:08] But so YOU SEE THAT CHURCH IS A
[23:11] UNIVERSAL CHURCH.
[23:15] It's a universal church of Jesus Christ.
[23:19] And now we know that WE HAVE THE
[23:21] CATHOLIC CHURCH.
[23:24] The Catholic church calls itself that
[23:26] church
[23:30] because the word Catholic means
[23:31] universal.
[23:35] AND SO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS
[23:37] CLAIMED to be that church.
[23:41] And they say they are the mother church.
[23:45] And they said everyone who is going to
[23:47] heaven should be a PART OF THE CATHOLIC
[23:49] CHURCH SYSTEM.
[23:54] But according to the word,
[23:57] we have found THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
[23:59] SYSTEM DOES NOT meet the qualification
[24:01] of being that church
[24:08] because they are a CHURCH DENOMINATION.
[24:13] THEY ARE a religious system.
[24:16] THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT A
[24:18] RELIGIOUS SYSTEM.
[24:22] THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT
[24:24] LOCATED IN ONE PLACE.
[24:28] It is not even a local church.
[24:32] The church of Jesus CHRIST IS A
[24:34] UNIVERSAL CHURCH
[24:37] all over the world.
[24:40] AND MEMBERS OF THAT CHURCH ARE BORN into
[24:43] it by being filled with the Holy Ghost,
[24:48] believing the word of the hour
[24:52] by accepting everything THE WORD OF GOD
[24:54] says
[24:57] by receiving the Holy Ghost.
[25:00] Now we realize that that church
[25:03] is a many membered body.
[25:09] your attention this morning.
[25:12] That church IS A MANY MEMBERED BODY.
[25:17] You will find some members of it in one
[25:20] location. Like I told you, we went to
[25:21] Kamoja.
[25:27] There was even no road to go there.
[25:31] And when we reached there, we found
[25:32] actually by the on the last day we in
[25:35] the last service there were 700 people.
[25:40] Did you know that
[25:42] in the bush there
[25:45] 700 people
[25:47] 700 people
[25:49] they were members of that body.
[25:53] One day I went to Ethiopia in a very
[25:55] rural area
[25:58] where there was even no road.
[26:02] We parked somewhere
[26:04] and we had to to to take the rest of the
[26:06] journey by on horseback.
[26:10] It was my first time to use a horse.
[26:13] So I had to learn how to guide it.
[26:16] And and you know it was a very
[26:18] interesting journey.
[26:20] And you see when we reached there there
[26:23] was that a few members of that church.
[26:27] They were baptized in the name of our
[26:28] Lord Jesus Christ
[26:30] and they received the Holy Spirit. and
[26:32] we've been in many places
[26:35] and you know one time a brother went to
[26:37] Germany
[26:39] and he asked me if there is any church
[26:41] where he is
[26:45] I told him yes there's a local assembly
[26:46] there
[26:49] and so it was just next door to where he
[26:51] was that he didn't even know
[26:54] so he just walked there and he found
[26:57] some believers there and they were
[26:59] telling him God bless
[27:02] That church has the same spirit all over
[27:04] the world.
[27:08] Wherever you go, you'll find members of
[27:11] that church.
[27:13] They have the same spirit.
[27:16] Amen. Whether they are white or red or
[27:18] yellow or black.
[27:20] They have the same same spirit. You will
[27:24] find the sisters. They are wearing
[27:26] modestly.
[27:28] They are dressing in dresses and in
[27:30] skirts.
[27:33] You will not find one member of that
[27:34] body IN A TROUSER. YOU cannot
[27:39] because the members of that church are
[27:41] all guided by the same word
[27:47] you will find even if you go to America,
[27:50] MEMBERS OF THAT CHURCH BODY,
[27:53] YOU WILL FIND THEM WHEN they hear the
[27:54] word, they will rejoice.
[27:57] SHOUT GLORY, HALLELUJAH,
[28:00] GLORY.
[28:00] The same way we do here, you will find
[28:03] them dancing the same way we do here.
[28:07] Even when THAT COUNTRY IS SO cold
[28:11] and the MANNERISM OF THAT COUNTRY IS SO
[28:13] different
[28:15] when they when they when they are
[28:17] members of the church of Christ in that
[28:19] country,
[28:22] you will find them behaving the same
[28:24] same way
[28:26] that everybody else is behaving
[28:29] as members of that church body. Are you
[28:32] following me? THEY WILL BEHAVE the same
[28:35] way. THEY WILL BELIEVE THE SAME THING.
[28:37] THEY WILL PREACH THE SAME GOSPEL. THEY
[28:40] WILL FOLLOW THE SAME characteristics
[28:43] as the very first church in the book of
[28:45] acts.
[28:48] Now in some place you may find there are
[28:50] thousands.
[28:52] In some place you may find two. In some
[28:55] place you may find 80 50.
[28:57] In some place you may find 2,000.
[29:00] I remember one time I spoke to a local
[29:02] church of 3,000.
[29:06] For my first time, I was overwhelmed.
[29:09] And they all believed what I believe.
[29:11] They all preached the same Bible the way
[29:13] I preached it.
[29:15] They all believed in the baptism in
[29:17] Jesus name.
[29:19] They all believed God has sent a prophet
[29:21] in our generation
[29:24] baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[29:27] Let me tell you, they are members of
[29:29] that church.
[29:32] And now we have what we call local
[29:34] assemblies.
[29:37] Local assemblies.
[29:40] Local assemblies.
[29:42] Wherever they gather.
[29:44] Some could be under a tree like in
[29:46] Kamoja.
[29:49] It could be in a building like this.
[29:51] Others it will be in a better building.
[29:55] Others will be in a bigger building.
[29:58] But really it is the same church.
[30:01] Those are just members.
[30:04] They are fellowships
[30:07] of the same church.
[30:10] Are you following me this morning?
[30:13] Now when Jesus Christ is coming to
[30:16] rapture the bride,
[30:20] he doesn't know days of the voice
[30:22] fellowship.
[30:24] Days of the voice.
[30:27] He doesn't know evening light bright
[30:29] tabernacle. Evening light bride.
[30:32] He doesn't know what what are the names.
[30:36] Only believe. Only believe. He doesn't
[30:39] know any of those names you've
[30:40] mentioned.
[30:42] He doesn't know nothing.
[30:45] The only thing he knows, my bride
[30:50] and that is the one he is coming to.
[30:53] When he comes to rapture his bride,
[30:57] he is NOT GOING TO FIRST ASK YOU WHO WAS
[30:59] YOUR PASTOR.
[31:03] But what is he going to do? Did you
[31:06] believe my word? Did you receive the
[31:08] token? DO YOU HAVE THE TOKEN?
[31:12] THE MOMENT HE FINDS THE TOKEN THERE,
[31:15] YOU are members.
[31:18] HE WILL RAPTURE YOU NOW.
[31:21] PRAISE the name of the Lord. Amen.
[31:24] Now, we appreciate local fellowships
[31:28] because in local fellowships like this
[31:30] one here, DAYS OF THE VOICE FELLOWSHIP,
[31:33] this is where we are FED
[31:36] FROM THE WORD OF GOD
[31:39] MATURES US INTO INTO THE FULL STATURE OF
[31:43] CHRIST.
[31:46] AND EVERY LOCAL FELLOWSHIP HAS A PART TO
[31:49] PLAY.
[31:53] BUT NOW MANY TIMES
[31:55] WE FIND THAT EVEN WITHIN LOCAL
[31:57] FELLOWSHIP
[32:00] SOME PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT EACH
[32:02] OF THEM HAS A PART TO PLAY.
[32:07] SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY
[32:09] ONES WHO ARE TO PLAY THE ONLY ROLE.
[32:14] You see even within the local church
[32:17] you have the song leader,
[32:20] you have the the musicians,
[32:23] you have the interpreters, you have the
[32:25] ushers, you have the cleaners, you have
[32:28] the deacons. What else do we have? We
[32:31] have the singers. You see, you clap your
[32:34] hands. You rejoice at the word.
[32:38] You know me, if you're just looking at
[32:40] me, I can't preach to you. You have to
[32:41] rejoice at the word.
[32:45] When you rejoice at the word, then God
[32:46] will bring more.
[32:50] When you rejoice, God brings more.
[32:53] So you also have a part to play.
[32:56] Amen. This is more than a stadium.
[33:00] You don't just in a stadium they rejoice
[33:02] and shout at the holler.
[33:06] What about in the house of God? We do
[33:08] the same SAME WAY EVEN MUCH MORE.
[33:12] We rejoice at the word. WE SAY GLORY
[33:15] HALLELUJAH. GLORY HALLELUJAH.
[33:17] And then God brings more to you. And
[33:20] then God brings more for you.
[33:21] So each of US HAS A PART TO PLAY even in
[33:24] the local body.
[33:29] Each of you has your place. Each of us
[33:31] has our place.
[33:34] Tell your neighbor, you have your place.
[33:38] You have your place.
[33:40] Let me tell you, each of you has to find
[33:41] YOUR PLACE IN THE BODY.
[33:46] IF YOU'VE NOT FOUND YOUR PLACE IN THE
[33:48] BODY OF CHRIST,
[33:50] YOU are an inactive member.
[33:54] YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IS [screaming]
[33:55] YOUR PLACE.
[33:57] GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS BODY.
[34:00] WHAT IS YOUR PLACE? ARE YOU THE EYE? Are
[34:04] you the ear? Are you the feet? ARE YOU
[34:07] THE HANDS? WHAT ARE YOU? YOU MUST BE A
[34:10] PART OF THE BODY WHEN YOU ARE ACTIVE.
[34:15] Praise the name of the Lord.
[34:17] NOW, AS IT IS IN THE LOCAL CHURCH BODY,
[34:22] so is IT IN THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH OF
[34:24] JESUS CHRIST,
[34:28] EVERY LOCAL FELLOWSHIP, WHEREVER THEY
[34:30] ARE,
[34:32] THEY HAVE THEIR [screaming] PLACE.
[34:36] WE HEAR DAYS OF THE VOICE.
[34:39] WE HAVE OUR PLACE.
[34:41] AMEN. ONLY BELIEVER HAS THEIR PLACE.
[34:43] ONLY BELIEVE.
[34:44] EVENING LIGHT HAS THEIR PLACE.
[34:47] EVERY CHURCH HAS THEIR PLACE. AND
[34:49] LISTEN, NO CHURCH FELLOWSHIP CAN TAKE
[34:52] THE OTHER'S PLACE.
[34:57] NO MINISTER CAN TAKE ANY OTHER'S PLACE.
[35:01] NOBODY IN THE CHURCH CAN TAKE YOUR
[35:03] PLACE.
[35:06] EACH INDIVIDUAL IS DIFFERENT.
[35:10] Each ministry IS DIFFERENT.
[35:13] WE DO NOT NEED TO COPY OR TO IMPERSONATE
[35:16] ONE ANOTHER.
[35:19] SAYS, "OH, I SAW PASTOR PREACHING WHEN
[35:21] DANCING AROUND.
[35:25] Let me do IT THE WAY YOU ARE DOING IT.
[35:28] IF YOU DO IT, YOU'LL ONLY BE ME. BUT YOU
[35:31] CANNOT BE ME.
[35:35] IF I TRY TO PREACH LIKE BROTHER MARTIN,
[35:37] I CANNOT.
[35:40] If I try TO PREACH LIKE ANOTHER
[35:41] PREACHER, I CANNOT BE MYSELF.
[35:46] AND IF ANOTHER PREACHER TRIES TO
[35:47] IMPERSONATE ME, THEY CANNOT MAKE it
[35:49] anymore.
[35:52] But why DO WE HAVE THOSE THINGS
[35:54] EVERYWHERE?
[35:56] BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT RECOGNIZE OUR PLACE.
[36:01] the day BEFORE WE FAILED.
[36:03] WE HAD TO BE WHAT GOD CALLED US TO BE
[36:05] AND WE MOVE ON.
[36:09] IF ALL OF US, EACH OF YOU,
[36:12] if we realize this,
[36:15] we could actually advance the kingdom of
[36:17] God more.
[36:22] There would be no room for jealousy.
[36:26] THERE would be no room for envy.
[36:29] NO ONE WOULD BE INTIMIDATED.
[36:32] OH, NO ONE WOULD FEEL INFERIOR.
[36:38] Are you following me?
[36:41] I'm dealing with some stuff this morning
[36:45] which I believe will help us
[36:49] to shape this fellowship
[36:51] into knowing our place.
[36:56] When when Jesus preaches to the
[36:58] disciples
[37:02] He calls the disciples.
[37:05] He He sends them out
[37:08] and they GO PREACHING, DOING MIRACLES,
[37:09] SIGNS AND WONDERS.
[37:12] Jesus himself
[37:15] was the one who groomed these men.
[37:19] JESUS HIMSELF
[37:21] CALLED THESE MEN. HE SANCTIONED THEM.
[37:24] And then they went out to preach.
[37:28] They went casting out devils
[37:31] in the name of Jesus. And one time they
[37:34] even came back to Jesus
[37:37] AND THEY SAID ALL DEMONS TREMBLE.
[37:41] WHEN THEY SEE US THEY TREMBLE AND SHOUT.
[37:46] And Jesus said that shouldn't make you
[37:47] excited.
[37:50] What should excite you is because your
[37:52] names are on the book of life.
[37:57] You should know your place. If you know
[37:59] your place, that should be enough to
[38:01] excite you.
[38:04] Do you know your place in the book?
[38:07] That should excite you.
[38:10] Amen.
[38:13] BUT THE DISCIPLES CAME. ONE time they
[38:16] came back.
[38:19] I believe one time as they were going
[38:21] out to preach,
[38:24] THEY SAW SOME OTHER PEOPLE.
[38:28] THE PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT PART OR MEMBERS
[38:30] OF THEIR LOCAL FELLOWSHIP.
[38:35] THE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT A PART OF WHERE
[38:37] THEY COME FROM.
[38:40] THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PASTORED BY THEIR
[38:42] PASTOR.
[38:45] THE PEOPLE WHO WERE OF ANOTHER
[38:47] FELLOWSHIP SOMEWHERE ELSE
[38:50] AND WHEN THEY SAW THEM THEY CAME
[38:53] RUNNING.
[38:54] THEY CAME BACK TO THEIR PASTOR
[38:57] AND THEY SAID, "PASTOR JESUS,
[39:00] CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WE FOUND?
[39:04] WE FOUND ONE PERSON OUT THERE.
[39:07] HE WAS CASTING OUT DEMONS
[39:10] IN YOUR NAME AND WE TOLD HIM
[39:14] YOU SHOULD STOP. AND THE REASON WE GAVE
[39:17] [screaming] HIM WAS NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE
[39:19] NOT A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH.
[39:24] HOW CAN HE CH OUT DEMONS IN YOUR NAME
[39:26] WHEN HE'S NOT A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH?
[39:30] HE HAS TO BE A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH.
[39:34] MIRACLES ARE ONLY COPYRIGHTED TO OUR
[39:36] CHURCH.
[39:39] THE POWER OF GOD IS ONLY IN OUR
[39:40] FELLOWSHIP.
[39:42] GOD IS ONLY MOVING HERE.
[39:45] AND WE TOLD THOSE PEOPLE,
[39:48] YOU ARE EITHER IN OUR CHURCH OR YOU ARE
[39:50] LOST.
[39:53] AND WE TOLD THEM, "SHUT UP.
[39:56] YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AS LONG AS YOU
[39:59] ARE NOT A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH."
[40:02] BUT JESUS LOOKED AT THE DISCIPLES
[40:04] AND HE TOLD THEM, "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE,
[40:10] THEY THAT ARE NOT AGAINST US?
[40:14] THEY ARE FOR US."
[40:16] HALLELUJAH. LET ME TELL YOU, LET ME TELL
[40:20] YOU, ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING IN
[40:22] THE RAPTURE,
[40:25] THEY ARE NOT ONLY HERE, THEY ARE NOT
[40:27] ONLY IN ONE LOCAL FELLOWSHIP,
[40:30] THEY ARE ALL [screaming] OVER.
[40:32] THEY EVERYWHERE
[40:34] AND I AM NOT THEIR PASTOR.
[40:37] I AM ONLY A PASTOR OF A FEW.
[40:43] IF EVERY LOCAL FELLOWSHIP
[40:46] WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE WOULD
[40:49] HAVE LESS JEALOUSY.
[40:52] WE WOULD HAVE LESS ENVY.
[40:55] WE WOULD NOT feel inferior.
[40:58] God look at the other church.
[41:01] They have more people. Oh God, me.
[41:05] Oh God, what am I going to do?
[41:08] Look at look at when I look at my
[41:10] church. God,
[41:12] I only have 50 people.
[41:14] Oh God. Oh God, why don't you make my
[41:18] church like the other?
[41:21] Oh God, look at the other church. They
[41:24] have instruments.
[41:26] Goodness, Lord. when they begin playing.
[41:30] Oh God, I don't even want to look at
[41:32] them because I feel bad. Oh, I wish mine
[41:37] was also like that.
[41:39] Oh god, THAT PREACHER.
[41:43] I even wish he was my pastor.
[41:47] When he begins preach, look at
[41:51] my pastor.
[41:54] This is what you have everywhere.
[41:57] Even in the message circles
[41:59] you have people envious
[42:02] you have people feeling you you have
[42:03] feeling inferior
[42:06] and others feel INTIMIDATED
[42:10] ministry is going to overwhelm my
[42:12] ministry
[42:14] and you fight you find pastors fighting
[42:16] against pastors
[42:18] you find churches fighting against
[42:19] churches you find even people saying my
[42:22] pastor is better than yours
[42:24] ministry is THE BEST IN THE
[42:27] NO, [screaming] YOUR MINISTRY IS NOT THE
[42:29] BEST IN THE WORLD.
[42:32] YOU HAVE ONLY HAD ONE MINISTRY IN OUR
[42:34] GENERATION
[42:36] and the BEST IN THE WORLD. THAT'S THE
[42:38] MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST.
[42:42] HALLELUJAH. AND HE HAS SENT HIS PROPHET
[42:46] WITH A MESSAGE OF THE END TIME,
[42:50] THE SECOND BEST MINISTRY IN THE WORLD.
[42:55] WE ALL ARE [screaming] FELLOWSHIP
[42:56] MEMBERS.
[42:59] REALLY, WE ARE ALL MEMBERS OF THE SAME
[43:01] ONE UNIVERSAL CHURCH.
[43:07] Praise the name of the Lord. And so
[43:09] Jesus told the disciples.
[43:11] You couldn't HAVE STOPPED THEM.
[43:14] GOD FORBID THEM. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD A
[43:17] COPYRIGHT ON JESUS.
[43:22] No one has a copyright on Jesus
[43:26] to THE EXTENT SOME CHURCHES WILL EVEN IN
[43:29] THE message
[43:32] even in the message
[43:35] they WILL FEEL AS IF THAT THEY HAVE
[43:37] [screaming]
[43:38] THEY HAVE THE THE FINAL SAY THEY HAVE
[43:40] THE AUTHORITY ON SOMEBODY.
[43:45] IF YOU WENT TO ANOTHER CHURCH,
[43:48] THEY WOULD TELL YOU YOU ARE [screaming]
[43:49] LOST.
[43:51] LET ME TELL YOU, YOU THAT FELLOWSHIP IN
[43:53] THIS CHURCH, I HAVE NO [screaming]
[43:56] OR COPYRIGHT OVER YOU.
[43:59] I DON'T OWN YOU.
[44:02] JESUS OWNS YOU.
[44:05] NOT DAYS OF THE VOICE FELLOWSHIP. DAYS
[44:07] OF THE VOICE.
[44:08] HALLELUJAH. WHAT DO WE BELIEVE? NO BOOK,
[44:11] NO BOOK, BUT THE BIBLE.
[44:14] MEMBERSHIP BUT FELLOWSHIP.
[44:18] WE DON'T COME HERE TO BE MEMBERS.
[44:21] WE HAVE WE COME HERE TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP.
[44:25] FELLOWSHIP WITH THE WORD OF GOD.
[44:27] FELLOWSHIP WITH THE HOLY GHOST,
[44:29] FELLOWSHIP WITH THE WITH THE HOLY
[44:31] SPIRIT.
[44:33] AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES US MEMBERS OF THE
[44:35] FULL
[44:38] UNTIL EVEN SOME WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR
[44:40] FELLOWSHIP WHERE YOU WERE ATTENDING.
[44:42] MAYBE YOU WERE COMING FROM FAR AND YOU
[44:44] WENT TO ANOTHER PLACE.
[44:49] THEN YOUR PASTOR WILL TELL YOU YOU MUST
[44:52] TRAVEL BACK HERE.
[44:55] If you don't YOU HAVE LEFT YOUR BLESSING
[44:57] HERE.
[44:59] THAT IS A LIE FROM THE DEVIL.
[45:03] YOUR BLESSING IS IN THE MESSAGE OF THE
[45:05] HOUR.
[45:08] NOT IN A LOCAL CHURCH BODY.
[45:12] YES, we believe IN A LOCAL CHURCH.
[45:15] WE BELIEVE IN HAVING A PASTOR. WE
[45:17] BELIEVE IN ATTENDING A CHURCH WHERE YOU
[45:19] SUPPORT THE CAUSE.
[45:23] A CHURCH WHERE YOU PAY YOUR TITHE.
[45:26] A CHURCH WHERE YOU MUST BE AMEN. YOU
[45:28] MUST ATTEND EVERY SERVICE.
[45:32] YOU HAVE A DUTY TO THAT CHURCH.
[45:35] That's what THE PROPHET SAYS. YOU HAVE A
[45:37] DUTY TO THAT CHURCH
[45:40] TO GO AND BE THERE WITH YOUR PRESENCE
[45:44] AND SUPPORT WITH YOUR MONEY.
[45:47] IT IS YOUR LOCAL CHURCH.
[45:49] YOU ARE A PLAY. YOU ARE A PART IN THAT
[45:51] BODY.
[45:53] AND WE believe in that in the message.
[45:56] LISTEN, THAT IN ITSELF
[45:59] DOES NOT REMOVE THE FACT
[46:02] THAT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST IS
[46:04] UNIVERSAL.
[46:08] If you were LIVING IN A LOCAL PLACE
[46:11] AND YOU MOVE TO ANOTHER LOCAL PLACE
[46:15] AND FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER YOU CAN'T
[46:17] GO BACK THERE,
[46:21] IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO CHANGE TO ANOTHER
[46:22] LOCAL CHURCH.
[46:27] AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE PROPHET SAYS,
[46:30] YOU ALL HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE
[46:34] WHICH LOCAL CHURCH TO ATTEND.
[46:39] NO PASTOR CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR YOU.
[46:43] JUST LIKE YOU MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICE
[46:46] ON WHO TO MARRY,
[46:48] NO PASTOR CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR YOU.
[46:52] IN THE SAME SAME WAY,
[46:54] YOU MAKE A CHOICE OF WHICH CHURCH, LOCAL
[46:57] CHURCH BODY TO ATTEND.
[47:03] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[47:05] And so we notice here that the DISCIPLES
[47:07] CAME RUNNING.
[47:09] I SAID JESUS
[47:11] THESE MEN WHERE DID THEY GET A RIGHT TO
[47:13] CAST OUT DEMONS
[47:17] where they get a right
[47:20] where they are not a member of our
[47:22] church
[47:24] for Jesus looked at the poor disciples
[47:27] what are you talking ABOUT IT'S NOT
[47:29] ABOUT CHURCH MEMBERSHIP
[47:32] it's not about AFFILIATION
[47:36] about the HOLY GHOST
[47:39] IT'S ABOUT THE POWER OF MY NAME.
[47:42] ANYBODY THAT BELIEVES IN ME
[47:45] AND USES MY NAME, NO MATTER WHICH LOCAL
[47:49] CHURCH FELLOWSHIP,
[47:51] THEN MY NAME WILL WORK MIRACLES.
[47:57] The only one who has no right
[48:01] is the one who really is not a true
[48:03] believer.
[48:06] And even then it is not your part to
[48:09] tell them you're not a true believer.
[48:14] God himself
[48:16] does that part.
[48:18] And I'll show you here some people who
[48:20] actually thought they were part of the
[48:22] church and God proved them otherwise.
[48:29] You go to Acts 19:3.
[48:34] I'm dealing with some spirits here and I
[48:35] really want you to cuz I'm laying a
[48:36] foundation for our fellowship here and I
[48:38] want you to really listen carefully.
[48:45] Acts chapter 19 verse 13.
[48:50] Then certain of the vagabon Jews exist
[48:52] took upon them to call over them which
[48:54] had evil spirits the name of the Lord
[48:56] JESUS SAYING WE ADARE YOU BY JESUS WHOM
[48:59] PAUL PREACHETH. And there were seven
[49:01] sons ofKeva, a Jew and a chief of the
[49:04] priests which did so. And the evil
[49:05] spirit answered and said, "Jesus, I know
[49:08] and Paul I KNOW, BUT WHO ARE YE?" AND
[49:10] THE MAN IN WHOM the evil spirit was
[49:12] leaped on them and overcame them and
[49:14] prevailed against them, so that they
[49:16] fled out of that house naked and
[49:18] wounded. And this was known to all the
[49:20] Jews and Greeks also dwelling at at
[49:22] Ephesus. And fear fell on them all. And
[49:24] the name of the Lord Jesus was
[49:26] magnified. Now listen to me.
[49:29] In this portion which we have read
[49:33] very interesting
[49:35] these Jews
[49:39] sons of
[49:42] seven sons of
[49:46] they came to some people
[49:49] and they also wanted to use the name of
[49:51] Jesus
[49:54] but they themselves were not genuine
[49:55] believers.
[49:58] Are you hearing me?
[50:01] And they began.
[50:04] WE HAVE STARTED OUR CHURCH HERE.
[50:08] We are more than three
[50:10] because a church is more than two.
[50:14] Two and above is a church.
[50:17] According to the Bible, he says where
[50:20] two or three are gathered, I will be in
[50:23] their midst. church, meaning a local
[50:26] body, a local fellow.
[50:29] So these were seven already
[50:32] and I BELIEVE THEY HAD SOME MEMBERS WHOM
[50:34] THEY WERE CASTING out demons from.
[50:43] Praise the name of the Lord.
[50:45] And as they begin praying,
[50:49] WE HAVE OUR CHURCH HERE.
[50:54] We have our FELLOWSHIP HERE.
[50:56] GOD HAS MOVED ON us
[51:00] to start a fellowship.
[51:03] Let me tell you, let me let me tell you.
[51:06] Let me tell you. If God ever let someone
[51:09] cut you
[51:14] and start another fellowship,
[51:17] you have my support 100%.
[51:20] Amen.
[51:22] Brother Solomon, if God led you to start
[51:26] a fellowship in
[51:28] one away from here,
[51:31] you have my support 100%.
[51:35] Do you believe God still leads?
[51:39] God leads.
[51:43] Why did I say that? If it is God, he
[51:46] proves it. If it is not God,
[51:50] he proves it.
[51:53] AND THESE ONES WENT OUT
[51:56] SAID WE HAVE A BURDEN TO START a
[51:58] ministry. I start a ministry. So they
[52:01] started and ONE OF THEM STARTED
[52:03] PREACHING. HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[52:07] AND HE CAME TO SOMEWHERE DEMONP
[52:08] POSSESSED
[52:11] SAID I CAST YOU OUT
[52:14] IN THE NAME OF [screaming] JESUS WHOM
[52:16] PAUL IS PREACHING ABOUT.
[52:19] And these demons looked at this.
[52:22] They said what
[52:26] the NAME OF JESUS. WE KNOW
[52:28] PAUL WE KNOW YOU. WE DON'T KNOW. WHO ARE
[52:32] YOU?
[52:34] THIS ONE SAID,
[52:40] "Come here." And the demons and those
[52:42] people unrest them
[52:47] and unrest them.
[52:49] And so they
[52:52] WERE ALL
[52:54] SCRATCHED ALL OVER, scratched
[52:55] everywhere. And even they had they had
[52:58] only a few pieces of cloth on them.
[53:02] and they went out
[53:04] ashamed.
[53:07] SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHAT
[53:10] HAPPENED THERE? DID THEY USE THE NAME OF
[53:13] JESUS?
[53:17] YES. SO WHAT WENT WRONG?
[53:20] THEY WERE NOT INDEED CALLED. [screaming]
[53:24] THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE BODY TO BEGIN
[53:26] WITH.
[53:28] THEIR MOTIVES WAS WRONG.
[53:31] THEY WERE NOT FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST
[53:32] THEMSELVES.
[53:34] THEY DID HAVE NO BURDEN FROM THE Lord
[53:38] and the demons didn't fear them and
[53:41] their work NEVER PROSPERED.
[53:43] IF GOD SENDS YOU,
[53:46] YOUR WORK WILL PROSPER ALWAYS.
[53:50] IF GOD, AMEN, ANOINTS YOU TO DO
[53:52] SOMETHING.
[53:54] What you're doing WILL SEE THE BLESSING
[53:56] OF THE LORD.
[53:59] It could be in the local body,
[54:02] but every time you're singing a special
[54:04] song,
[54:06] you are causing confusion.
[54:10] Rather sit down.
[54:13] It's not your rightful place.
[54:16] EVERY TIME you go TO PLAY THE PIANO,
[54:20] CONFUSION,
[54:22] just leave the thing.
[54:25] IF WHAT? IF GOD IS SENDING YOU TO DO
[54:27] SOMETHING,
[54:29] IT WILL SEE HIS BLESSING.
[54:34] Praise the name of the Lord. AND SO WHEN
[54:36] GOD CALLED US HERE
[54:39] as an example to start days OF THE VOICE
[54:42] FELLOWSHIP,
[54:43] I CAN NOW SAY, IT WAS GOD.
[54:49] WHY SOULS ARE SAVED? THE DEMON POSSESSED
[54:53] A DELIVER. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH
[54:55] THE HOLY GHOST. THE POWER OF GOD HAS
[54:58] BEEN MOVING. GOD HAS BEEN MOVING IN OUR
[55:00] LIVES. HAS HE BEEN MOVING?
[55:03] THAT IS A PROOF TO THE DEVIL
[55:06] THAT GOD IS WITH US.
[55:09] AND NOW WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES,
[55:12] GOD WILL keep sending more.
[55:17] If 10 people rose up around me
[55:21] to start up another fellowship,
[55:24] I wouldn't worry a bit.
[55:28] Why? If God sent them,
[55:31] it will prosper their way.
[55:34] If it's not God, it will show itself.
[55:38] Secondly,
[55:40] I can never be them. They can never be
[55:42] me.
[55:45] I am not intimidated by them.
[55:48] You should never be intimidated by
[55:50] somebody else.
[55:55] Oh, that sister is singing a better
[55:57] special.
[56:01] Oh God. Now when I sing, nobody would
[56:04] even be blessed.
[56:07] That's the devil lying to you.
[56:10] You are you and nobody is like you.
[56:15] You are the only one in the world
[56:18] like you.
[56:20] Always be confident. Always know your
[56:24] place.
[56:26] There is a blessing in recognizing your
[56:28] place.
[56:34] So in Luke 9:49,
[56:38] the Bible says, "And John answered AND
[56:40] SAID, MASTER, WE SAW ONE CASTING OUT
[56:42] DEVILS IN THY NAME, and we forbid him
[56:44] because he followth not with us." And
[56:46] Jesus said unto him, "Forbid him not,
[56:47] for he that is not against us is for us.
[57:03] for he that is not against us is for us.
[57:09] Can we say amen?
[57:16] The disciples became jealous when they
[57:18] saw someone doing what they were doing.
[57:23] And many pastors even in the message are
[57:25] like these disciples.
[57:30] They became jealousy
[57:32] when they saw someone doing what they
[57:34] were doing.
[57:36] SO OUR MASTER
[57:39] we stopped them
[57:42] because what they were doing they were
[57:44] not following us.
[57:47] Who told you I have to follow you in
[57:48] order to do what you're doing?
[57:55] I don't have to follow anybody.
[57:58] I have to follow Jesus Christ.
[58:01] But these disciples thought
[58:04] if YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH
[58:08] OR IF YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING US,
[58:12] you are against us.
[58:14] And that's how denominations have been
[58:16] formed.
[58:19] One day I went to Nairobi
[58:22] and I was so flabbergasted. I met this
[58:24] sister
[58:28] and I was in a certain local fellowship
[58:31] and they were having the Lord's supper
[58:37] and this sister she was from another
[58:39] local fellowship
[58:41] just like me. We [clears throat] were in
[58:43] that local fellowship
[58:47] and the sister, she didn't go to take
[58:49] the Lord's supper
[58:52] and she was a message believer. So I
[58:54] said, "Why?"
[58:56] She said, "Because this is not my
[58:58] church."
[59:03] I said, "What?
[59:05] You mean if it's not your local
[59:06] fellowship,
[59:09] you can't have the Lord supper here?
[59:12] I'm sorry. Someone has to correct me. I
[59:14] thought that was wrong.
[59:19] We take the Lord's supper as members of
[59:21] the church of Jesus Christ,
[59:25] not as members of a local fellowship.
[59:30] I think it HAS COME TO A PLACE
[59:34] WHERE WE HAVE MADE OURSELVES
[59:36] DENOMINATIONS.
[59:40] ORGANIZED RELIGION IN THE message
[59:44] and YET IN THE MESSAGE LISTEN IN THE
[59:47] MESSAGE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE
[59:50] FLYING BIRDS. [screaming]
[59:56] WE HAVE RECEIVED THE ANOINTING OF A
[59:57] FLYING [screaming] EAGLE.
[1:00:00] WHERE WE ARE NOT BOUND BY RELIGIOUS
[1:00:03] BOUNDARIES.
[1:00:07] HALLELUJAH. WHERE TWO THINGS ARE LEADING
[1:00:09] US.
[1:00:11] THE WORD OF [screaming] GOD.
[1:00:14] EVERYBODY SAY THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:00:16] THE WORD OF GOD
[1:00:19] to the Holy Spirit.
[1:00:22] COME ON, SAY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:00:26] IN THE MESSAGE.
[1:00:28] WE ARE NOT A DENOMINATION
[1:00:32] WHICH LEAD US TO
[1:00:34] THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:00:37] AND THE WORD
[1:00:42] not the laws of our churches WHERE WE
[1:00:44] FELLOWSHIP.
[1:00:46] EVEN IF me your PASTOR I TELL YOU LET US
[1:00:49] DO THIS OR DO YOU DO THAT
[1:00:53] AND IT CONTRADICTS THE WORD
[1:00:56] YOU CAN REJECT WHAT I TELL YOU
[1:00:59] OBEY WHAT THE WORD SAYS
[1:01:04] FOLLOW ME
[1:01:06] AS I FOLLOW CHRIST SO WE FOLLOW YOU AS
[1:01:10] LONG AS YOU'RE FOLLOWING JESUS CHRIST
[1:01:13] IF YOU FOLLOW SOMETHING ELSE
[1:01:15] I I'M SORRY I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU NO MORE.
[1:01:20] THAT IS WHY WE ARE NOT IN THE
[1:01:21] DENOMINATION.
[1:01:23] THAT'S WHY WE LEFT THE DENOMINATION.
[1:01:26] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TO BE FREE PEOPLE.
[1:01:30] TO BE FREE PEOPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
[1:01:33] THE HOLY GHOST
[1:01:35] TO BE FREE PEOPLE. THEY WILL FOLLOW
[1:01:38] EVERY WORD OF GOD.
[1:01:42] So these disciples
[1:01:44] they became jealous when someone was
[1:01:46] doing what they were doing.
[1:01:49] They thought that they had a copyright
[1:01:51] on the name Jesus.
[1:01:54] They thought that they were the only one
[1:01:56] that were called and anointed and
[1:01:57] favored.
[1:02:01] I'm telling you if you're not going to
[1:02:03] days of the voice fellowship
[1:02:05] days of the voice you missing the
[1:02:07] rapture.
[1:02:09] Who told you?
[1:02:11] I never wanted to come to that place
[1:02:14] where I tell people that if you're not
[1:02:16] coming to my church, you're not going to
[1:02:17] the right.
[1:02:20] It is God who has a copyright for them.
[1:02:24] The Bible says the secret is he knows
[1:02:26] those that are his.
[1:02:32] You know what made denominations?
[1:02:36] Do you know what made them?
[1:02:39] The Catholics [clears throat] said,
[1:02:41] "We are the only church. As long as you
[1:02:44] are not a member, you are lost."
[1:02:47] The Anglicans also say, "WE ARE THE ONLY
[1:02:49] CHURCH. IF YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER, YOU ARE
[1:02:52] LOST."
[1:02:53] The Pentecostal groups,
[1:02:56] the holiness, we are the only church.
[1:03:01] We are the only church
[1:03:03] assemblies of God. We are the only
[1:03:04] church
[1:03:06] apostolic. We are the only church
[1:03:09] and now in the message it has gotten to
[1:03:11] that extent.
[1:03:14] WE ARE THE ONLY CHURCH. IF YOU'RE NOT
[1:03:16] COMING OF THE FAVOR FELLOWSHIP, YOU ARE
[1:03:19] LOST TO THE EXTENT THAT SOMEONE WILL
[1:03:23] TRAVEL 100 kilometers
[1:03:27] to GO TO A CHURCH
[1:03:29] WHEN THERE ARE 50 CHURCHES IN THAT
[1:03:31] DISTANCE.
[1:03:36] AND HE'S NOT TRAVELING THAT DISTANCE
[1:03:39] BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST LED HIM.
[1:03:42] BUT HE'S TRAVELING THAT DISTANCE
[1:03:44] BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING
[1:03:46] US, YOU ARE LOST.
[1:03:50] That's a denominational spirit.
[1:03:53] That's a religious spirit.
[1:03:56] But we are no longer OF RELIGION OR
[1:03:57] RELIGIOUS LEAD SPIRIT.
[1:04:00] GOD HAS CALLED US OUT OF DENOMINATIONAL
[1:04:03] BARRIERS.
[1:04:06] HE SAID, "COME UP.
[1:04:09] COME UP, [screaming] MY EGOS.
[1:04:11] COME AND GO BEYOND THAT.
[1:04:14] COME IN a place where I'm going to
[1:04:17] prepare you for the rapture."
[1:04:20] And I'm not saying that we do also like
[1:04:22] the religious people do
[1:04:26] that we go to the nearest church.
[1:04:33] No.
[1:04:36] We are not religions.
[1:04:38] We don't go to the nearest church.
[1:04:42] We have some people here who have
[1:04:43] traveled 50 kilometers to me.
[1:04:48] You go to a church that is preaching the
[1:04:51] full word of God
[1:04:53] and believes the moving of the Holy
[1:04:54] Ghost. Number three, a church that your
[1:04:59] spirit is happy with
[1:05:03] where you are growing in the spirit.
[1:05:06] A church where you feel that you you you
[1:05:08] have the liberty of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:11] for you to grow for you to expand in the
[1:05:13] realm of the Holy Spirit. A church where
[1:05:16] where you are growing uh by being fed on
[1:05:19] the true word of God.
[1:05:25] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:05:27] Not because I told you, oh now if you
[1:05:28] leave here you are lost.
[1:05:35] GOD HELP US.
[1:05:37] GOD HELP US
[1:05:39] THAT WE WILL recognize our praise.
[1:05:45] They forgot that they had to mind their
[1:05:48] calling.
[1:05:53] You see, actually to them calling on the
[1:05:55] name of Jesus was right and as long as
[1:05:57] it was done by them.
[1:06:04] Listen to what Bam says here in a
[1:06:07] messenger greater than Solomon is here.
[1:06:12] And actually he says, brother Bham says,
[1:06:15] notice now how petty these people can
[1:06:18] be.
[1:06:22] These disciples just like other men.
[1:06:26] Two or three days later, they found a
[1:06:28] man casting out devils
[1:06:32] and he was getting the job done.
[1:06:36] Amen. Amen. He was doing a real job.
[1:06:40] And the disciples found him. And just
[1:06:43] like the men of our day, of our day,
[1:06:48] they said, they said, "You come and join
[1:06:52] our denomination.
[1:06:56] You are casting a demon and you're doing
[1:06:58] the job.
[1:07:00] How can it be?
[1:07:02] Let me tell you, let me listen.
[1:07:06] I found
[1:07:09] called church
[1:07:14] to be interpreted apostolic church of
[1:07:16] Ethiopia.
[1:07:20] And this church
[1:07:23] if you don't know the foundations of the
[1:07:25] message properly,
[1:07:28] you will actually think you have arrived
[1:07:32] in that church.
[1:07:35] They believe what? What do you What do
[1:07:37] you believe here?
[1:07:39] Tell me what do you believe?
[1:07:43] Decency.
[1:07:45] They believe in decency.
[1:07:50] Be specific. Be specific.
[1:07:57] Women not cutting off their hair.
[1:08:01] They believe that.
[1:08:04] What else? Baptism in Jesus name.
[1:08:09] They believe that
[1:08:11] one God. They believe that
[1:08:16] the Holy Spirit. They believe that
[1:08:19] they speak in tong.
[1:08:22] Women don't preach.
[1:08:26] They believe that.
[1:08:28] Sometimes
[1:08:31] they may let them preach
[1:08:33] but it is very rare. So if you are gone
[1:08:37] there the first time you may not know
[1:08:39] that they
[1:08:43] interpret
[1:08:45] tongues
[1:08:48] rapture they believe they are the only
[1:08:50] ones going in the rapture.
[1:08:57] Sisters, don't put on makeup. Oh, yeah.
[1:09:03] Now, some of you are saying
[1:09:07] yes.
[1:09:09] No, they don't. They don't even know
[1:09:10] that God sent a prophet.
[1:09:16] Now, we are beginning the difference.
[1:09:20] Did you hear what I said?
[1:09:24] Now, if you don't know what you believe,
[1:09:28] among these [clears throat] people
[1:09:30] actually I met this one of their elders.
[1:09:32] He told me
[1:09:34] brother the only church of Jesus Christ
[1:09:38] is the apostolic church.
[1:09:41] They are calling apostolic because they
[1:09:43] believe everything the apostles taugh
[1:09:50] and they say if you're not a part of the
[1:09:52] religious denomination
[1:09:56] you are lost.
[1:09:59] They have members,
[1:10:01] I mean they have their branches all over
[1:10:04] the world, even here in Uganda.
[1:10:10] And those people have genuine love.
[1:10:15] Genuine love, but they are the greatest
[1:10:18] denomination I've ever seen.
[1:10:21] So they do not know that denomination is
[1:10:22] even going to be the one to bring the
[1:10:24] mark of that beast.
[1:10:29] There have to come a time where they
[1:10:30] have to give the right hand of
[1:10:31] fellowship
[1:10:36] according to the prophecy. They don't
[1:10:38] know that God sent a prophet.
[1:10:41] They don't know about the revelation of
[1:10:42] the seven seals.
[1:10:45] They don't know about the serpent seed.
[1:10:48] I'm telling you, there are many things
[1:10:49] they don't know.
[1:10:51] And yet, these are the things that are
[1:10:52] going to perfect the bride for the
[1:10:54] rapture.
[1:10:58] So now,
[1:10:59] HOW are you going to meet such people?
[1:11:04] If you thought YOU WERE THE ONLY one
[1:11:05] that knows what you know,
[1:11:09] as a matter of fact, for them, they
[1:11:10] don't even wear rings.
[1:11:15] because they say it is worldly.
[1:11:19] But in the message we even use
[1:11:27] actually it is getting more worldly
[1:11:28] indeed
[1:11:31] in the message. But those people they
[1:11:34] they are cleaned up from those things.
[1:11:40] But we know it also gets to a place
[1:11:42] where they go legalism.
[1:11:46] I'm telling you this so you can know.
[1:11:49] You are not the only ones who believe
[1:11:50] the basics that you believe.
[1:11:55] There are many others WHO BELIEVE IT AND
[1:11:57] PART of your system.
[1:12:01] I would not be shocked
[1:12:04] if some believers who would go in the
[1:12:06] rapture are even a part of those
[1:12:17] You see, you kept quiet because you also
[1:12:20] believing like the disciples.
[1:12:24] THEY ARE NOT A [screaming] PART OF US.
[1:12:26] WE STOPPED THEM.
[1:12:29] You don't you don't have the key for the
[1:12:31] rapture.
[1:12:35] You don't have the key to open and close
[1:12:37] the DOOR FOR THE RAPTURE.
[1:12:40] THAT IF SOMEONE DOES NOT come to your
[1:12:42] church, he's going to hell.
[1:12:46] NO,
[1:12:47] IT IS GOD WHO HAS KEPT THAT FOR HIMSELF.
[1:12:52] THE BIBLE SAYS HE KNOWS THEM THAT ARE
[1:12:55] HIS.
[1:12:59] If I was this disciples,
[1:13:02] I may NOT UNDERSTAND.
[1:13:05] SINCERELY, I want you, brother, to try
[1:13:07] and understand them.
[1:13:11] these men. They know Jesus is the
[1:13:13] Messiah.
[1:13:15] They know he's the one who called them
[1:13:17] and trained them.
[1:13:20] How many did he call?
[1:13:23] 12.
[1:13:25] So where did these other
[1:13:29] where did they get the money?
[1:13:33] HOW HOW COME?
[1:13:35] THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T even ask BEFORE
[1:13:37] THEY STOPPED THIS.
[1:13:40] THEY JUST SHUT UP. PLEASE
[1:13:44] don't defame the name of our Lord.
[1:13:47] Shut up. But Jesus told them, I
[1:13:50] understand you. You were not there when
[1:13:53] I was calling those.
[1:13:55] They are not even a part of our members
[1:13:56] of our church.
[1:14:00] if they are not against us.
[1:14:07] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WE SHOULD HAVE THAT
[1:14:09] OPEN MIND
[1:14:11] TO KNOW THAT GOD IS USING ALL THOSE
[1:14:13] MESSAGE CHURCHES THAT ARE NOT US.
[1:14:18] And God has POTENTIAL
[1:14:22] OF CALLING HIS BRIDE WHEREVER SHE IS.
[1:14:26] HALLELUJAH. SHE MIGHT BE IN A CATHOLIC
[1:14:28] CHURCH.
[1:14:31] YES, SIR.
[1:14:34] YES. SHE MIGHT BE IN AN ANGLICAN CHURCH
[1:14:36] SOMEWHERE.
[1:14:38] I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE WILL BELIEVE THAT.
[1:14:41] SOMEBODY WILL CALL HER OUT OF THERE.
[1:14:44] SHE'LL BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:14:47] YOU DON'T HAVE A [screaming] COPYRIGHT
[1:14:48] ON THE RAPTURE.
[1:14:52] MUST MIND YOUR CALLING
[1:14:55] OR YOU [screaming] ARE BLESSED.
[1:14:57] MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME TO ME AND asked
[1:15:00] if you preach against women preachers.
[1:15:04] Are you saying all women preachers are
[1:15:06] going to hell?
[1:15:09] I said that is not mine to say
[1:15:13] but here's what the Bible says.
[1:15:16] My mandate
[1:15:18] is to preach what THE BIBLE SAYS.
[1:15:21] MY MAND HALLELUJAH IS TO TELL YOU THE
[1:15:24] RAPTURE IS COMING.
[1:15:26] MY MANDATE, AMEN, IS TO PREACH TO YOU
[1:15:28] THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:15:30] MY MANDATE IS TO TELL YOU THAT JESUS IS
[1:15:33] ALIVE.
[1:15:36] ANYBODY ELSE DOING ANYTHING THEY WANT TO
[1:15:38] DO, IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS
[1:15:44] AND I AM NOT GOING TO FIGHT THEM.
[1:15:49] THAT'S why I don't believe in THE GOSPEL
[1:15:50] PREACHING AGAINST OTHERS.
[1:15:57] NO,
[1:15:58] THAT IS NOT THE GOSPEL.
[1:16:00] LET ME ASK you a question, church.
[1:16:02] What is the gospel?
[1:16:06] But what is the gospel? The word gospel
[1:16:08] means what?
[1:16:12] God bless you.
[1:16:14] The gospel is good news.
[1:16:18] So if I come here and I begin fighting
[1:16:21] against
[1:16:23] fighting against
[1:16:26] I'm sorry that is not the gospel
[1:16:31] and some preachers even mentioned these
[1:16:32] names
[1:16:36] and
[1:16:38] nailed those.
[1:16:41] What about if you found in the rapture?
[1:16:49] Now you are feeling like the disciples.
[1:16:54] How come that they come here?
[1:16:57] I'm telling you the apostolic church
[1:16:58] believe they're the only ones going in
[1:16:59] the rapture.
[1:17:04] I don't know about
[1:17:07] I know about the mandate that I have
[1:17:10] that I'm preaching the message preparing
[1:17:13] the bride
[1:17:16] and so brother Bham here then continues
[1:17:17] to say
[1:17:19] and the disciples found him
[1:17:22] just like the men of our day they said
[1:17:23] you come and join our
[1:17:27] actually just remember this this man is
[1:17:29] a is a fat man with fat big eyes.
[1:17:34] And so he told me when he SAID WHEN THE
[1:17:37] MOMENT THEY MEET YOU,
[1:17:40] he ask you, "Do you believe in one God?"
[1:17:43] I said, "Yes." Yeah.
[1:17:44] Do you believe in what about
[1:17:46] Christian? Yes.
[1:17:48] He opened his mouth
[1:17:52] and then he thought of something else to
[1:17:53] ask.
[1:17:55] They have some differences there.
[1:17:58] The difference they have, they have two
[1:17:59] groups.
[1:18:01] Apostolic Church
[1:18:03] and the United Pentecostal Church.
[1:18:04] United Pentecostal Church.
[1:18:05] The difference they have, one says the
[1:18:08] body of Jesus was divine
[1:18:13] and others say the body was a human.
[1:18:22] But they both believe he was God.
[1:18:25] So now he asked me. So when we went into
[1:18:28] that, I told him The seed of Jesus
[1:18:33] was not from Joseph. It was from God.
[1:18:37] Therefore, I believe he was 100% man.
[1:18:41] 100% God.
[1:18:44] He opened his mouth and his eyes.
[1:18:46] Then why don't he join us?
[1:18:50] According to him, I believed everything
[1:18:53] they believe.
[1:18:55] I'm supposed to be a part of them.
[1:18:59] I I told him, "My brother,
[1:19:03] all those things I believe, but there is
[1:19:05] more."
[1:19:08] He said, "How come THERE IS MORE?
[1:19:10] THERE CAN'T BE MORE." I SAID, "BROTHER,
[1:19:13] THERE IS MORE."
[1:19:15] I TELL YOU IN THE MESSAGE, THERE IS
[1:19:16] MORE. [screaming]
[1:19:20] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THAT'S WHY GOD KEEP
[1:19:22] SENDING PREACHERS
[1:19:26] BECAUSE THERE IS MORE.
[1:19:28] IN EVERY GENERATION AT EVERY TIME. THERE
[1:19:32] IS MORE THAT GOD WANTS TO REVEAL.
[1:19:36] OTHERWISE, he would have only used one
[1:19:38] man,
[1:19:41] but there is more.
[1:19:45] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:19:48] Oh my, I might be a little bit longer
[1:19:50] than usual, but are you are you are you
[1:19:51] listening?
[1:19:53] All right. So, let's let's carry on a
[1:19:55] little bit here. He says, "You you come
[1:19:56] and do so you you can't you come hook up
[1:19:59] with us
[1:20:01] because you can't do this unless you go
[1:20:04] with us."
[1:20:07] But they were just a little bit too
[1:20:09] late.
[1:20:11] God was already proving he was doing it
[1:20:14] with this man.
[1:20:17] He heard Jesus SAY, "WHOMSOEVER WILL,
[1:20:20] LET HIM COME.
[1:20:28] THE MAN WAS CHASING DEMON.
[1:20:30] THE one the disciples never understood.
[1:20:35] HE HAD JESUS
[1:20:38] WHO
[1:20:40] LET him come.
[1:20:46] He had the will and he came and started
[1:20:48] the job.
[1:20:49] Oh my goodness.
[1:20:50] Amen.
[1:20:53] Hallelujah.
[1:20:55] They were jealous
[1:20:58] because that this man was getting the
[1:21:00] job done.
[1:21:04] JEALOUS AT THE ALTAR [screaming]
[1:21:08] and they could not do it.
[1:21:13] This man was done doing getting the job
[1:21:15] done.
[1:21:17] And that's the way it is today.
[1:21:20] Who starts a jealousy?
[1:21:22] Is men in great prestige sometimes?
[1:21:28] Who starts it?
[1:21:31] Many times it's a man. He says it is
[1:21:34] great prestige. Men in great prestige
[1:21:37] sometimes
[1:21:42] who because of different denominational
[1:21:45] barriers
[1:21:48] also so prestige
[1:21:52] they are afraid to come out and tell
[1:21:53] their church that the Holy Spirit lives
[1:21:55] today to make intercessions [snorts]
[1:22:04] and and will heal our sickness today
[1:22:06] just the same as he did then.
[1:22:10] Listen listen, are you listening? And is
[1:22:13] jealousy
[1:22:17] because it's not in their denomination,
[1:22:20] not in their social ranks.
[1:22:23] God, listen, are you hearing me now? But
[1:22:25] God can deal in any rank that he wants
[1:22:28] to deal in.
[1:22:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:22:35] God can deal in any round.
[1:22:41] That is his own sovereign will.
[1:22:47] Oh, how little that we can be sometimes
[1:22:49] on those things
[1:22:54] and it does nothing but stand in the way
[1:22:56] of a real believer.
[1:23:07] Yeah, those things, you know, stand in
[1:23:10] the way of a real believer.
[1:23:16] The other brother is playing better than
[1:23:18] me.
[1:23:21] God bless you, brother. Brilliant.
[1:23:24] That brother is playing better than
[1:23:27] trying. I can't even play.
[1:23:32] I can't play again.
[1:23:34] But brother,
[1:23:38] jealousy,
[1:23:42] just know your place.
[1:23:45] You are you and you are you alone.
[1:23:49] Nobody like you.
[1:23:53] Some preachers are even afraid of
[1:23:54] inviting some preachers on their
[1:23:55] pullpit.
[1:24:00] because I'm talking about the altar. I
[1:24:02] can talk about that.
[1:24:08] Ah, how come I invite brother Seawa
[1:24:14] to come and preach
[1:24:16] yet I know his ministry.
[1:24:23] Let me protect my sheep.
[1:24:26] Listen,
[1:24:28] this message is not like the Pentecostal
[1:24:31] denomination.
[1:24:34] It does not come as to connect us around
[1:24:36] one man,
[1:24:40] two men or three men.
[1:24:43] It has come to connect us with Jesus
[1:24:46] Christ.
[1:24:49] Who is Jesus Christ? Is the bishop of
[1:24:52] our soul.
[1:24:55] Amen.
[1:24:56] Hallelujah.
[1:24:58] God gives us pastors
[1:25:01] in every local assembly.
[1:25:03] BROTHER SAYS, "GIVE THEM RESPECTS."
[1:25:09] But if you BELIEVE IN YOUR PASTOR
[1:25:12] AND YOU GIVE HIM RESPECT,
[1:25:15] GOD WILL USE him
[1:25:17] to take you through.
[1:25:21] But if YOU DON'T GIVE THAT MAN RESP
[1:25:32] HERE, that Sunday, the other Sunday they
[1:25:35] are there. The other Sunday they are
[1:25:36] there. I don't believe that either. That
[1:25:39] is wrong. It's wrong. We are all members
[1:25:43] of one church,
[1:25:45] but each of us has a home
[1:25:49] fellowship.
[1:25:51] where we are supposed to be
[1:25:54] and and and support the cause
[1:25:57] and then if there's a convention
[1:25:59] or gathering and everybody's gathering
[1:26:03] so right
[1:26:05] don't even wait to ask me by the way
[1:26:07] members of days of the voice don't even
[1:26:08] wait to ask me
[1:26:13] pastor should I go
[1:26:16] unless we have our own program
[1:26:21] Please go.
[1:26:24] We are free.
[1:26:27] Why? Because we are not a denomination.
[1:26:34] I'll deal with a little more here then
[1:26:35] I'll put it to a pause. Now in Genesis 4
[1:26:44] vers 3.
[1:26:49] And in the and in process of time it
[1:26:51] came to pass that Cain brought of the
[1:26:53] fruit of the ground an offering unto the
[1:26:55] Lord. And Abel he also brought of the
[1:26:57] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[1:26:59] thereof. And the Lord had respect unto
[1:27:02] Abel unto his offering. But unto Cain
[1:27:04] unto his offering, he had not respect.
[1:27:06] And Cain was very wroth, and his
[1:27:08] countenance fell. And the Lord said unto
[1:27:10] Cain, Why art thou wroth? And why is thy
[1:27:13] countenance fallen? If thou doest well,
[1:27:16] shalt thou not be accepted. And if thou
[1:27:17] doest not well, sin lith at the door.
[1:27:19] And unto thee shall be his desire, and I
[1:27:21] shall rule over him. And Cain talked
[1:27:23] with Abel his brother. And it came to
[1:27:25] pass when they were in the field that
[1:27:27] Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
[1:27:29] and slew him. And the Lord said unto
[1:27:31] Cain, "Where is thy brother Abel?" And
[1:27:34] he said, "I know not. Am I my brother's
[1:27:36] keeper?" And he said, "What hast thou
[1:27:39] done? The voice of thy brother's blood
[1:27:40] cereth unto me from the ground, and now
[1:27:43] at thou cast from the earth, which has
[1:27:46] opened her mouth to um to receive thy
[1:27:49] brother's blood from thy hand." Praise
[1:27:51] the name of the Lord.
[1:27:53] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:27:55] Cain kills his brother.
[1:27:58] What was the reason?
[1:28:02] Jealousy.
[1:28:03] Where was the jealousy started from?
[1:28:08] Where was it exactly?
[1:28:11] At the altar.
[1:28:14] At the altar.
[1:28:17] God have mercy.
[1:28:19] But says, "Now we find out that because
[1:28:21] that Cain listened to the enemy,
[1:28:26] then what happened? He become the first
[1:28:29] murderer.
[1:28:31] He become the first one that had
[1:28:33] jealousy on earth.
[1:28:38] Tell me where that pure line from God to
[1:28:40] Adam. That's only that's the only
[1:28:41] connection. Adam was the son of God.
[1:28:45] The Bible said. So then where did that
[1:28:48] jealousy come from?
[1:28:53] Ask your neighbor, where did that
[1:28:54] jealousy,
[1:28:58] did it come from Adam?
[1:29:01] It couldn't have.
[1:29:03] It come from Satan.
[1:29:07] It's exactly where it come from.
[1:29:12] Now, we find out that he was the first
[1:29:13] murderer
[1:29:16] and he was the first one to have
[1:29:17] jealousy.
[1:29:21] He was the very first one to have
[1:29:23] jealous
[1:29:25] and Lucifer got jealous of Michael.
[1:29:29] Please listen. Please listen. He brought
[1:29:32] it down to the earth and transferred it
[1:29:34] into man.
[1:29:37] Kain by taking on this evil took the
[1:29:40] first mark.
[1:29:45] God marked him.
[1:29:47] No one was no one was to kill him.
[1:29:53] You know that mark
[1:29:55] I remember there was some people
[1:29:56] singing.
[1:29:59] He said uh then one pastor was praying.
[1:30:02] He said oh God
[1:30:05] give these people
[1:30:08] the mark of Cain
[1:30:12] so that nobody will touch them
[1:30:15] so that they will be untouchable.
[1:30:19] Lack of revelation is a very dangerous
[1:30:21] thing.
[1:30:24] The mark of the of Kane is the mark of
[1:30:26] the beast.
[1:30:29] The Bible says in the tribulation,
[1:30:33] those who shall receive the mark
[1:30:36] that they will not be touched.
[1:30:40] Why? They will leave.
[1:30:44] They will not be persecuted
[1:30:46] because they will already be in the
[1:30:47] system.
[1:30:50] But the ones who will not have the mark,
[1:30:53] they will be persecuted.
[1:30:55] They will be killed.
[1:30:58] But those will be the foolish virgins.
[1:31:02] So they will have eternal life
[1:31:04] and they will have to pay it with their
[1:31:05] own.
[1:31:08] But here we see the first time this
[1:31:11] marker was given the mark of the beast.
[1:31:16] It was given to Cain.
[1:31:19] Praise the name of the Lord. It was
[1:31:20] given to Kane.
[1:31:23] Excuse me.
[1:31:25] And Cain received the mark of the beast.
[1:31:29] Why did he receive the mark of the
[1:31:30] beast? Kane received the mark of the
[1:31:32] beast.
[1:31:34] Because
[1:31:35] he was a son of the serpent.
[1:31:41] Number one. Number two.
[1:31:43] He refused to repent.
[1:31:46] And that's the very first man that had
[1:31:48] jealousy.
[1:31:52] Jealousy is a bad thing.
[1:31:56] Never entertain jealousy in your heart.
[1:32:01] A man that knows his place
[1:32:05] cannot have jealousy.
[1:32:10] A woman who knows her place
[1:32:13] can entertain jealousy.
[1:32:16] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:32:18] Hallelujah.
[1:32:19] Hallelujah.
[1:32:20] Sisters who are married here.
[1:32:24] Jealousies of the devil.
[1:32:27] If you know your place,
[1:32:30] never entertain jealous in your heart.
[1:32:33] And marriage is built on trust.
[1:32:37] If you trust that your husband truly
[1:32:39] loves you,
[1:32:42] that is all that matters.
[1:32:45] Love him back.
[1:32:47] Some women are so jealous.
[1:32:50] The husband will pick a phone call.
[1:32:54] Who are you talking to? Who are you?
[1:32:59] What is that? Jealousy.
[1:33:02] Jealousy.
[1:33:03] And that breaks families,
[1:33:06] that breaks home. But if you know your
[1:33:08] husband loves you,
[1:33:12] all right.
[1:33:12] Hello.
[1:33:14] Yeah. I love you, too.
[1:33:19] You won't even come.
[1:33:21] WHO IS THAT ONE?
[1:33:24] You know, he will tell me anyway. No
[1:33:26] problem.
[1:33:27] He will tell me. And then soon soon
[1:33:30] sooner or later you say by the dinner I
[1:33:33] was talking to my mom
[1:33:36] is she talking to the morning
[1:33:40] but if you had been jealousy
[1:33:43] and maybe a SEED THERE
[1:33:46] IS closed and then he also ANGER YOU AND
[1:33:49] HE SLAPS you
[1:33:52] and then you meeting
[1:33:55] you saying I'm going home and then he's
[1:33:57] marrying another girl.
[1:33:59] Jealousy.
[1:34:02] Let me tell you this same jealousy is
[1:34:06] also at the altar.
[1:34:09] It's a bad thing.
[1:34:12] JEALOUSY [screaming] AT THE ALTAR IS THE
[1:34:14] WORST CASE.
[1:34:18] BOTH THESE BROTHERS CAME TO GIVE AN
[1:34:20] OFFERING TO THE LORD.
[1:34:25] I WISH KNEW HIS PLACE.
[1:34:29] YOU WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE FELT bad
[1:34:32] because
[1:34:34] sometimes the person you're having
[1:34:35] jealousy over is not even meant to be in
[1:34:38] your future.
[1:34:44] Sincerely, think about Kane and Abel.
[1:34:47] Kane could never take place no matter
[1:34:50] what Kane did.
[1:34:54] Was it possible?
[1:34:56] Completely impossible.
[1:34:59] Kane was of another seat.
[1:35:02] Abel was of another seat.
[1:35:06] No matter what Kane would do,
[1:35:09] he can never take Abel's place.
[1:35:12] So they give an offering
[1:35:15] brought the beautiful fruit. Kane
[1:35:17] brought the beautiful fruit.
[1:35:19] Wonderful
[1:35:21] smelling nice.
[1:35:24] You know fruits they can so look so
[1:35:25] nice.
[1:35:27] and he put it at the altar.
[1:35:30] Which song do you think he was singing
[1:35:31] that morning as he was giving his
[1:35:34] offering?
[1:35:37] Bringing in the sheep.
[1:35:41] Bringing in the sheep.
[1:35:43] Bringing in the sheep. Me, my son Kane.
[1:35:47] Your son Kane, Lord.
[1:35:52] Oh, bringing in.
[1:35:54] And he put everything. He was putting
[1:35:56] the upjuities
[1:36:10] shall come
[1:36:12] and then at the end of the day he
[1:36:14] brought the fire
[1:36:16] the fire.
[1:36:22] What does say
[1:36:26] send your power just now?
[1:36:29] Oh Lord, send your power
[1:36:32] and baptize all these fruits.
[1:36:36] And at that moment
[1:36:38] when he put the fire,
[1:36:41] of course he had to sing another song.
[1:36:43] Now the smoke was going before the
[1:36:45] praise.
[1:36:47] Praise the name of the Lord. And as the
[1:36:50] as as the smoke was going up,
[1:36:54] oh, he was so happy and overjoyed.
[1:36:58] I feel the
[1:37:03] and and and as it was going up,
[1:37:07] it reached somewhere
[1:37:11] and God was choking
[1:37:20] said back
[1:37:25] and Kane was like what
[1:37:29] said okay let me first calm myself maybe
[1:37:33] I did a mistake let me see what my
[1:37:35] brother will do
[1:37:39] and the same same way
[1:37:42] I bear
[1:37:44] he went in his flock
[1:37:47] Bringing in the sea. Bringing
[1:37:55] in the
[1:37:59] as he brought it to the altar.
[1:38:02] He brought a stone
[1:38:05] and then he he got the sheep, put at the
[1:38:08] altar and put up the neck and cut the
[1:38:12] throat.
[1:38:14] OH, IT shall come rejoicing, ringing.
[1:38:17] And at that moment, the song changed
[1:38:19] when blood came over him. Oh, the blood
[1:38:24] of Jes.
[1:38:28] What's that? Oh, that is so disgusting.
[1:38:33] Look at the blood.
[1:38:35] Even the song I don't like it. What kind
[1:38:38] of song is that with the blood all over
[1:38:39] him?
[1:38:43] Mine is better. I'm sure God is pleased
[1:38:46] with me more. But we shall see. We shall
[1:38:47] see because we have brought very clean
[1:38:50] offerings.
[1:38:53] And by the end of the offering at the
[1:38:56] altar,
[1:38:58] Cain
[1:39:00] also brought the fire.
[1:39:03] Say, "OH LORD, SEND YOUR POWER JUST NOW.
[1:39:08] LORD, send your power just now.
[1:39:10] [screaming] ALL THE SAME same way and
[1:39:14] the smoke began
[1:39:16] as it reached before the throne of God
[1:39:20] was I believe he called one of the
[1:39:22] angels
[1:39:25] give me THE NEWS WHAT IS THAT
[1:39:28] SMELLING SO NICE [screaming]
[1:39:32] bring it on
[1:39:36] [groaning]
[1:39:37] who is that YOUR SON
[1:39:40] I KNEW
[1:39:41] TAKE A DAY AND AND WHEN THAT happened
[1:39:45] Kane was like what
[1:39:47] I'm sure these brothers we are both
[1:39:48] spiritual so they must have seen what
[1:39:50] was going on
[1:39:53] they were seeing WHAT WAS GOING ON AND
[1:39:55] CAME SAID WHAT
[1:39:58] I OFFERED THE BEST SACRIFICE
[1:40:01] GOD NEVER ACCEPTED IT
[1:40:08] from that moment
[1:40:09] wow The word jealousy was formed for
[1:40:14] he began feeling bad about his brother.
[1:40:17] And let me tell you, brother, sister, if
[1:40:19] you're here
[1:40:21] and you have jealousy,
[1:40:23] just know it doesn't come from God.
[1:40:26] Jealousy is of the devil.
[1:40:30] AND CAIN WAS THE FIRST TO HAVE JEALOUSY.
[1:40:34] So it MEANS HE LOVES
[1:40:37] MORE THAN HE LOVES ME.
[1:40:41] IT MEANS HE LOVED HIS SACRIFICE BETTER
[1:40:43] THAN MINE.
[1:40:47] [gasps]
[1:40:48] How could he be so ruthless?
[1:40:52] And at that moment, God saw what was
[1:40:55] going on.
[1:40:57] So he told Gabriel, "Prepare my chariot,
[1:41:01] we are going down, let me see my boy,
[1:41:04] and I will talk to him."
[1:41:07] And in a moment in a
[1:41:11] then God came on the earth
[1:41:14] and he met Kane
[1:41:16] SAID HELLO ANYBODY HOME.
[1:41:20] HE SAYS YES FATHER I'M HERE
[1:41:23] and and GOD TOLD KANE YES MY SON
[1:41:28] WHY ART thou
[1:41:31] what is happening? You know some people
[1:41:33] they like being angry sad.
[1:41:37] If you're always like that is a wrong
[1:41:39] spirit on you
[1:41:43] times that spirit is not brought it
[1:41:45] doesn't come on itself. It comes with
[1:41:47] other spirits behind it.
[1:41:52] It comes with anger, jealousy, envy.
[1:41:57] SO NOW CAIN WAS ANGRY. HE WAS SAD. his
[1:42:01] coldness had fallen. SO GOD TOLD HIM,
[1:42:04] "WHY ARE YOU LIKE THAT?"
[1:42:06] HE SAID,
[1:42:10] "I don't even know." And God said,
[1:42:16] "If you do well,
[1:42:19] won't I receive you also
[1:42:22] and accept your offering?"
[1:42:27] came in at that moment
[1:42:30] God thought he was preaching a powerful
[1:42:32] sermon
[1:42:34] and at that moment he was just firing up
[1:42:37] that jealousy in Cain.
[1:42:41] WHAT IS HE TRYING TO SAY THAT I DID NOT
[1:42:45] DO WELL
[1:42:50] the way I I brought those fruits
[1:42:54] the way I handled them? The way I
[1:42:58] the way I wash him,
[1:43:02] he wants me to go and do that thing that
[1:43:05] Abel was saying.
[1:43:10] Cain was jealous.
[1:43:14] And that moment
[1:43:16] God told him,
[1:43:18] "Go and do that. I'll receive you." And
[1:43:21] Kane was like, "Okay, okay, okay." But
[1:43:24] in his heart,
[1:43:26] He knows he had that jealousy.
[1:43:29] He didn't know his place.
[1:43:32] If he had known his place, by the way,
[1:43:35] he would have repented
[1:43:38] and done well. So even when you're bad,
[1:43:41] if you know your place,
[1:43:44] it will help you.
[1:43:46] At that moment when God left, he told
[1:43:50] his brother, "Brother, my brother, my
[1:43:53] dear brother,
[1:43:55] come I take you somewhere."
[1:43:57] So they went somewhere. Brother, you
[1:44:00] know, God came and that someone
[1:44:04] really touched me. So I'd like to go and
[1:44:07] see how you're doing
[1:44:10] in your field.
[1:44:13] Brother Abel was having clean heart.
[1:44:17] told me it's all right. Let's go my
[1:44:19] brother. As they were there
[1:44:23] in the field of
[1:44:26] he looked here,
[1:44:30] no angel, no God, no deacon, no.
[1:44:36] got the neck of
[1:44:39] got a stone
[1:44:42] squeezed his neck
[1:44:45] and the man died.
[1:44:47] He said, "Now we shall see. We shall see
[1:44:50] which offering he will receive
[1:44:54] buried him in the sand
[1:44:56] and and he cleaned himself.
[1:44:59] He came back."
[1:45:01] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:45:02] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:04] AMEN.
[1:45:06] And I'm ready for the service today
[1:45:09] and God came down. The service started
[1:45:14] who song that day.
[1:45:16] He was even very spiritual.
[1:45:21] OH [screaming]
[1:45:22] LORD SEND POWER JUST
[1:45:25] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:27] YES SIR. AMEN.
[1:45:29] But he knew what he had done.
[1:45:32] He knew what he had done.
[1:45:34] Brother, let me tell you, jealousy is a
[1:45:37] bad demon.
[1:45:40] And at that time, when God came, he
[1:45:44] said, I'm cursing you.
[1:45:47] But before he did that, he told him,
[1:45:50] "Where is your brother?
[1:45:53] Where is your brother?"
[1:45:56] Elizabeth,
[1:45:58] come back.
[1:46:00] I want you to hear this part. And at
[1:46:02] that moment,
[1:46:04] he God and I'm about to finish. God
[1:46:06] looked at Cain
[1:46:09] and he asked him a question.
[1:46:12] He said, "Where is your brother?"
[1:46:18] The man who was spiritual turned,
[1:46:23] "Am I my brother's keeper?
[1:46:27] When did you make him keep
[1:46:32] We should be our brother's keeper.
[1:46:36] You should always check on them.
[1:46:39] If you don't see somebody in church,
[1:46:41] call them.
[1:46:44] Is everything all right?
[1:46:46] We should be our brother's keep.
[1:46:50] And and at that moment, things happened.
[1:46:53] And then God told Cain because you
[1:46:56] didn't do well. Now I'm placing a cast
[1:46:58] on you and I'm putting a mark.
[1:47:03] Whoever sees you will not kill you.
[1:47:07] And God and and Kane knew what this man.
[1:47:11] [screaming]
[1:47:12] You have given me a very strong
[1:47:14] punishment.
[1:47:17] And God said,
[1:47:19] you know, at that moment Kane would have
[1:47:21] repented.
[1:47:24] But he did not. Jealousy.
[1:47:28] Friends, jealousy at the altar is the
[1:47:31] worst thing.
[1:47:38] If you if God has given you your place,
[1:47:44] maintain your place.
[1:47:48] In Romans 12:4 it says, "For as we have
[1:47:50] many members in one body, and all
[1:47:52] members have not the same office, so we
[1:47:54] being many are one body in Christ, and
[1:47:57] everyone members of one another. Having
[1:47:59] then gifts, listen, if you have a Bible,
[1:48:02] read as I I read because of time the
[1:48:04] brother will not read this. Having then
[1:48:06] gifts deferring according to the grace
[1:48:08] that is given to us. Where the prophecy,
[1:48:10] let us prophesy according to the
[1:48:11] proportion of faith. Or ministry, let us
[1:48:14] wait on min on our ministering. Oh, he
[1:48:16] that teacheth on teaching. Or he that
[1:48:19] exhortth on exhortation. He that giveth,
[1:48:22] let him do it with simplicity. He that
[1:48:24] ruleth with diligence. He that showeth
[1:48:26] mercy with cheerfulness. And here is
[1:48:28] what I wanted to say. Each of us is
[1:48:31] special.
[1:48:35] Tell somebody, no one can take an
[1:48:42] No one can take your place.
[1:48:45] So we need one another to be a fully
[1:48:47] functional body.
[1:48:51] No one can take another's place
[1:48:54] even in the church. That's why you need
[1:48:57] to be here at the services.
[1:48:59] Don't say well I'm a little nobody.
[1:49:01] Nobody.
[1:49:02] You have your place in the flesh.
[1:49:06] Joseph, another believer. He couldn't
[1:49:08] help being what he was.
[1:49:12] Joseph,
[1:49:15] he was a prophet. God made him a
[1:49:17] prophet. He didn't want to be different
[1:49:19] from his brother. But he was different.
[1:49:23] God made him what he is.
[1:49:27] Nobody else could take HIS PLACE. NOBODY
[1:49:30] ELSE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. GOD HAS MADE
[1:49:32] YOU WHAT YOU ARE.
[1:49:35] NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[1:49:38] EVEN IN YOUR FAMILY, even in your
[1:49:40] church, even in your place of work, EVEN
[1:49:43] AT YOUR COMMUNITY,
[1:49:45] NO [screaming] ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[1:49:50] Nobody can take your place. NO MATTER
[1:49:53] HOW LITTLE YOU ARE.
[1:49:55] SO WHY HAVE JEALOUSY?
[1:49:58] WHY HAVE ENVY?
[1:50:00] YOU ARE SPECIAL.
[1:50:03] NO ONE CAN EVER TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[1:50:06] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. You say I'm just a
[1:50:08] housewife.
[1:50:11] NOBODY CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[1:50:13] GOD IN HIS GREAT ECONOMY.
[1:50:16] He has SAID SO THE BODY OF CHRIST IN
[1:50:19] ORDER. [screaming]
[1:50:23] AMEN. IN ORDER
[1:50:25] TILL THERE IS NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR
[1:50:28] PLACE. THIS IS YOUR PROPHET SAYING THAT.
[1:50:36] I say believe it in the NAME OF JESUS
[1:50:38] CHRIST. NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[1:50:42] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:50:43] AND BROTHER BAMIR SAYS, "OH, HOW I WOULD
[1:50:46] LIKE TO TAKE BROTHER BILLY GRAHAM'S
[1:50:47] PLACE,
[1:50:53] any of us ministers,
[1:50:55] BUT WE CANNOT DO IT. BUT REMEMBER, BILLY
[1:50:59] CAN'T TAKE OUR PLACE. BILLY, WE ALL HAVE
[1:51:04] A PLACE.
[1:51:06] ONE PASTOR SOMEWHERE ELSE HAVE HIS
[1:51:08] PLACE.
[1:51:10] Another pastor has his place. AS HERE
[1:51:13] MYSELF, I HAVE MY PLACE. AND WHEN I'M
[1:51:16] MINISTERING, I DON'T LOOK AT OTHERS AND
[1:51:19] HAVE JEALOUSY.
[1:51:20] I don't look at OTHERS AND HAVE ENVY. I
[1:51:23] KNOW MY PLACE IN CHRIST.
[1:51:26] AND I KNOW NOBODY can take my place.
[1:51:29] Nobody can take your place. Also,
[1:51:32] we all have pastors.
[1:51:34] Whatever we are, brother says,
[1:51:37] our housewives, some mechanics,
[1:51:40] some farmers,
[1:51:42] whatever it is, God has set you in your
[1:51:46] place.
[1:51:59] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:52:02] There's a lot I had. I I I thought I
[1:52:05] would not finish it. But let me before
[1:52:07] we close,
[1:52:10] let us look a little bit about John the
[1:52:12] Baptist.
[1:52:18] And we shall close with that. Now John
[1:52:21] had baptized Jesus.
[1:52:25] And from there Jesus's ministry started.
[1:52:29] Now listen very closely now.
[1:52:32] And this caused more people.
[1:52:38] This caused more people to follow Jesus
[1:52:41] more than John.
[1:52:48] What do you think it made John's
[1:52:50] disciples feel?
[1:52:57] Let us see how they felt. John chapter
[1:52:58] 3:27. John answered and said, let us
[1:53:02] begin from 26. And they came unto John,
[1:53:04] and they said unto him, Rabbi, he that
[1:53:07] was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom
[1:53:09] thou beest witness. BEHOLD, THE SAME
[1:53:11] BAPTIZES, and all men come to him,
[1:53:23] PASTOR,
[1:53:25] YOU REMEMBER the brother who was
[1:53:27] fellowshipping here?
[1:53:30] The one you baptized?
[1:53:32] The one you groomed?
[1:53:34] Yes, I remember.
[1:53:36] He started a church there
[1:53:39] and he has more people than ours.
[1:53:42] If you were that pastor, what would you
[1:53:43] do?
[1:53:49] Let us see what Pastor John said to his.
[1:53:54] John answered and said, "A man can
[1:53:56] receive nothing
[1:53:58] except it be given him from above."
[1:54:06] He's saying we can only be what God HAS
[1:54:09] CALLED US TO BE.
[1:54:14] NO MAN CAN MAKE ANYTHING OF HIMSELF.
[1:54:19] IF HE DOES, IT WILL CRUMBLE.
[1:54:24] TRUE MEN OF GOD ARE GOD MADE, NOT
[1:54:26] SELFMADE.
[1:54:33] AND JOHN KNEW THAT.
[1:54:36] SO HE SAID, "WHATEVER HE IS, GOD HAS
[1:54:39] MADE HIM.
[1:54:42] DON'T BOTHER HIM WITH DON'T BOTHER ME
[1:54:44] WITH JESUS'S MINISTRY.
[1:54:47] HIS MINISTRIES OF GOD,
[1:54:49] LET HIM BE WHAT GOD HAS DONE.
[1:54:52] I HAVE NOTHING TO do with it. I ALSO
[1:54:54] HAVE MY OWN MINISTRY.
[1:54:57] AND WHEN HIS MINISTRY WAS FINISHED,
[1:55:00] his head was cut off.
[1:55:03] No man can make him himself anything.
[1:55:08] cannot make himself an interpreter.
[1:55:12] If he makes himself, it will crumble.
[1:55:15] Brother Martin can't make himself a
[1:55:17] preacher.
[1:55:19] IF AT ALL THAT GIFT IS THERE,
[1:55:23] it means it is GIVEN TO HIM BY GOD
[1:55:28] THAT CANNOT CRUMBLE.
[1:55:31] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. BROTHERS ON THE MUSIC
[1:55:33] TEAM. WHATEVER YOU ARE, YOU DID NOT MAKE
[1:55:38] YOURSELF
[1:55:39] GOD HAS MADE YOU THAT.
[1:55:43] AND IF IT IS NOT GOD,
[1:55:45] IT WILL SURE CRUMBLE.
[1:55:48] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHATEVER GOD HAS MADE
[1:55:50] YOU,
[1:55:52] it will never crumble.
[1:55:56] Hallelujah. Amen. And I even say in this
[1:55:59] little fellowship here sometimes things
[1:56:01] happen
[1:56:03] like
[1:56:05] the other one left
[1:56:08] the church is going to crumble.
[1:56:11] I have never had those thoughts.
[1:56:16] There was a time when we were alone in
[1:56:18] the house here four five of us.
[1:56:23] The other place you became 10, 15, 25,
[1:56:25] 40.
[1:56:26] Some would go, some would come, some
[1:56:28] would go, some
[1:56:30] and people who are very good at coming
[1:56:33] to criticize,
[1:56:38] they be behind there talking.
[1:56:40] Brother, what do you feel these days in
[1:56:42] the church?
[1:56:45] The spirit is no longer there. The
[1:56:48] anointing is really
[1:56:50] even people, even people are dozing
[1:56:52] dozing.
[1:56:54] I think the speed has left us.
[1:56:57] Yeah. Yeah. And they begin moving those
[1:56:59] rumors.
[1:57:02] And then even the person who was active
[1:57:05] when they begin hearing that they will
[1:57:08] also say, "Yeah, but by the way, so when
[1:57:10] he comes to church, he will say, you
[1:57:13] will also be
[1:57:15] the anointing.
[1:57:17] I think the church is crumbling.
[1:57:20] Let me tell you, no one started this
[1:57:22] child.
[1:57:25] It is God who started it
[1:57:28] and it cannot crumble.
[1:57:30] It will not crumble. If the devil has
[1:57:32] been waiting for that, I HAVE BAD NEWS
[1:57:35] FOR HIM THIS MORNING. WHATEVER GOD
[1:57:37] [screaming] STARTS, IT CANNOT CRUMBLE.
[1:57:42] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME
[1:57:45] OR BECAUSE OF YOU. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE
[1:57:47] WORK OF GOD IN OUR LIVES.
[1:57:51] JUST KNOW YOUR PLACE.
[1:57:54] God bless you. Stand on your feet.
[1:58:00] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:58:03] There's quite more I had to deal with. I
[1:58:05] I just send this I just send this not on
[1:58:08] the church group. I just feel I should
[1:58:09] send it to you so that you can be able
[1:58:10] to go through other scriptures.
[1:58:18] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:58:21] Hallelujah. How many love the Lord?
[1:58:25] Amen.
[1:58:31] Amen. Let us sing. Oh Lord, send the
[1:58:33] power just now.
[1:58:39] Let us first pray. our precious heavenly
[1:58:42] father.
[1:58:44] Maybe there is someone here [music] Lord
[1:58:45] who has been having a spirit of jealousy
[1:58:50] and maybe even in the family
[1:58:53] where they come from Lord they've been
[1:58:56] so much tormented by that spirit.
[1:59:00] Maybe they felt that their father loved
[1:59:02] the the other more than them
[1:59:06] or their boss loved another more than
[1:59:08] them
[1:59:10] or something of the kind Lord or maybe
[1:59:13] even in the church.
[1:59:15] I pray that oh God that the spirit of
[1:59:18] God will just come upon them
[1:59:20] and forgive them Lord. Give them grace
[1:59:23] Lord Jesus.
[1:59:25] Father we pray oh God you that died and
[1:59:28] rose again
[1:59:30] that you come and let that spirit leave,
[1:59:32] oh God,
[1:59:34] and let the spirit of God come and
[1:59:36] replace
[1:59:38] where that spirit has [music] been. Oh
[1:59:39] God,
[1:59:41] Father, we know that you are alive
[1:59:44] and you do miracles. Help
[1:59:46] us to be a church, to be a people, Lord
[1:59:49] Jesus, that will be delivered from those
[1:59:52] demons,
[1:59:54] powers of darkness, those wicked forces
[1:59:56] of evil, that we shall be women and men
[2:00:00] that stand OUR GROUND AND KNOW OUR PLACE
[2:00:04] AND HAVE THIS confidence
[2:00:07] that God knows our name.
[2:00:10] No one can TAKE OUR PLACE.
[2:00:13] NO ONE CAN TAKE our place.
[2:00:16] Father, maybe somebody has been
[2:00:17] tormented before
[2:00:20] by a wrong spirit and Lord even as they
[2:00:23] would [music] they would torment them
[2:00:25] and maybe even send cuss words to them
[2:00:27] Lord
[2:00:30] that if you leave here you are gone you
[2:00:32] you are cast you never mount anything
[2:00:35] you
[2:00:37] for nothing you you are lost father let
[2:00:40] that that spirit come off of them right
[2:00:42] now
[2:00:43] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:00:46] For you, oh God, that has started a good
[2:00:47] work in heaven. You are going to
[2:00:50] accomplish it, Father. For we are the
[2:00:52] body of Jesus Christ. And we here are a
[2:00:55] part of it, Lord. And oh God, you are
[2:00:58] doing a great work in our lives.

[2:01:04] to come and take over completely in our
[2:01:06] lives
