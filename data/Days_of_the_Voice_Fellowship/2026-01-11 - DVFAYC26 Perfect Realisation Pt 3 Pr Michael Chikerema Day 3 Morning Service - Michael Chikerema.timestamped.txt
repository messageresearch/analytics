[53:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is a day of climaxes.
[53:16] I feel that many of us have already uh
[53:18] taken our blessing.
[53:22] So, we just reaffirming it.
[53:26] Amen. Yesterday was wonderful.
[53:30] Amen. Was a wonderful day. Ah, the last
[53:33] preacher made me lose my voice.
[53:37] Man, pray. Pastor Tasha is a preaching
[53:39] machine.
[53:44] God bless you, Pastor.
[53:47] And all our precious brother that have
[53:49] ministered,
[53:51] we say, "God, the ministers, God bless
[53:53] you."
[53:56] Amen. And so uh brother from Ethiopia
[54:03] uh ministered this morning
[54:06] and uh he while I speak these few words
[54:10] if my family and a few others if you
[54:12] could come
[54:14] because okay I don't have much of any
[54:17] voice left but there's a song I wanted
[54:19] us to sing. I don't know if we could
[54:20] still do it. We can pray
[54:23] as we usher in the word this morning.
[54:26] So brother shared a little bit of his
[54:28] testimony
[54:30] saw ministered uh the word to us this
[54:33] morning.
[54:35] Was it not wonderful?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; It was really wonderful.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And so this morning
[54:44] we have one last lap with brother
[54:47] Michael.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] as uh I I spoke to you yesterday,
[54:57] I just wanted to rehearse it to you this
[55:00] morning.
[55:02] Um Pastor Michael.
[55:05] Yes. Thank you.
[55:08] You can just stand there and wait.
[55:11] And others could come as well.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:17] And and so uh don't concentrate on them.
[55:20] Concentrate on what I'm saying.
[55:24] He broke the ice
[55:26] &gt;&gt; and and so I was saying that Pastor
[55:28] Michael
[55:30] uh is a busy man
[55:35] just like all the other preachers.
[55:39] He's a very busy man
[55:41] and you are not concentrating on what
[55:43] I'm saying.
[55:46] I said he's a busy man.
[55:52] And so to get him to come here
[55:56] even to begin to give an invitation,
[56:00] it was by faith
[56:03] not knowing whether he will accept.
[56:06] Uh I mean he still I have proposed to
[56:10] him he should resign at the place of
[56:12] work and concentrate on the ministry
[56:13] full time.
[56:16] But uh nonetheless, he's still he's
[56:19] still working full-time
[56:22] and full-time ministry.
[56:26] And uh
[56:28] and I think brother Josh would agree
[56:30] with me,
[56:32] Pastor Michael has one of the biggest
[56:34] churches in Australia.
[56:38] And like he told us here, you know, it
[56:41] has it's a multinational church
[56:45] and I did not know him.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; But when brother Gary Walker invited me
[56:50] to Australia,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; he set me up to visit a few places.
[56:56] Brother Michael's place was one of those
[57:00] and we just kind of struck a very good
[57:02] connection
[57:04] and he's a real man of God. He has
[57:07] blessed us.
[57:09] And um if the Lord tries,
[57:11] we would want you to come back again.
[57:14] Amen. Sure enough. Sure enough. I
[57:17] believe that this is just one of the
[57:18] many
[57:20] Amen. one of the many visits.
[57:26] And and so um after here he will be
[57:30] going to Kenya.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac is going to be carrying
[57:35] his itinerary there.
[57:39] And so if you want to know where he's
[57:40] going to be,
[57:43] brother is the man.
[57:46] So you can follow him up and attend the
[57:49] meetings there
[57:50] because I'm sure the few meetings he has
[57:52] preached here is not enough.
[57:56] We need more.
[57:58] Amen. Are there others joining us?
[58:02] Come on, brothers. You can't leave this
[58:04] to us.
[58:06] come.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll come down. I'll come.
[58:12] Honestly, we didn't practice this. We've
[58:14] sung it before in the church, but we do
[58:16] not practice it now.
[58:23] So, we sang it a long time ago. So, we
[58:26] we we don't know really how it will go.
[58:29] And my voice is broken up. So, I'm
[58:30] giving a lot of disclaimers,
[58:34] but my daughters and sons will help.
[58:39] Amen.
[58:40] Who wasn't a piano last time? Was it
[58:43] you?
[58:45] Was it Shem? Who is Shem?
[58:54] Brother, brother promise is one of the
[58:55] good pianists.
[58:57] How many appreciate brother promise?
[59:00] Amen. He too can do a good job and and
[59:04] um can you get on the organ, please?
[59:10] Amen. This is just we're not going to
[59:12] really sing for you. We're going to
[59:13] worship together as we usher in the the
[59:15] ministry of the word this morning.
[59:18] I know this song, we all know it, but I
[59:20] don't know if you have the word. Psalms
[59:22] 34. Uh I sought the Lord and he answered
[59:25] me.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd like us to sing it
[59:26] together. If you can get the words,
[59:28] that's fine.
[59:38] This one probably needs a microphone. He
[59:41] always But he doesn't need a microphone
[59:42] because he has the highest voice
[59:43] usually.
[59:46] Amen. I'll just I'll just stand here.
[59:58] I sought the Lord
[1:00:02] and he answered me
[1:00:07] and delivered me
[1:00:11] from every fear.
[1:00:16] Those who look on him
[1:00:21] are right.

[1:09:50] shake every hand that's here.
[1:09:54] And if I be honest, as a Christian, I
[1:09:56] can't remember all your names,
[1:10:00] but I know your faces, and I want you to
[1:10:02] know I love you all.
[1:10:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:08] And uh well, brother Bas said a few
[1:10:10] things here that could make even an
[1:10:11] African man blush.
[1:10:18] You know,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; you know, some of these things we didn't
[1:10:22] plan on them.
[1:10:25] We we never grew up to want to be
[1:10:28] pastors and ministers and and all these
[1:10:30] things.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And many time we are as surprised as you
[1:10:35] are surprised.
[1:10:38] that we are where we are
[1:10:41] and we are doing what we are doing.
[1:10:45] Amen. So we we we but we at the same
[1:10:49] time accept the responsibility the Lord
[1:10:51] has given us
[1:10:54] and we just like this morning at
[1:10:57] breakfast we were just making the
[1:10:58] brothers laugh as we were sharing our
[1:11:01] our boyhood experiences.
[1:11:05] Praise the Lord. So, like I did mention,
[1:11:08] me and Rev, we share the same spiritual
[1:11:11] grooming
[1:11:14] and for probably over 20 years, we've
[1:11:18] operated in very different spheres.
[1:11:24] But every time someone hears you preach
[1:11:26] or you interact with them, they'll be
[1:11:28] asking, "Do you know brother?"
[1:11:34] And I'm sure it's been the same with
[1:11:36] him.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we call each other and say,
[1:11:40] "Brother, I'm getting sick and tired of
[1:11:41] this thing."
[1:11:46] And we laugh about it.
[1:11:48] Amen. But we've never shared meetings.
[1:11:53] We've never shared meetings
[1:11:56] in all our boyhood years.
[1:12:00] I think we've shared some first street
[1:12:03] preaching.
[1:12:06] when we were young boys
[1:12:09] preaching on the streets of Arar.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that was the last time we
[1:12:16] kind of preached along the same way.
[1:12:21] The Lord led him this way. I was led
[1:12:23] that way.
[1:12:25] But we've never been under pressure to
[1:12:26] take the same meeting.
[1:12:30] But inwardly we knew
[1:12:33] that at some point
[1:12:36] we will have to come together again and
[1:12:37] take some meetings.
[1:12:44] Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; So God had to use our precious brother.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you say it right?
[1:13:00] brother, brother Tenua
[1:13:03] to bring us together in the form of
[1:13:05] meetings.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; So it's an experience to cherish
[1:13:14] also been good to come with brother
[1:13:17] Joshua
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; a young bing minister from the land of
[1:13:24] the kangaroos.
[1:13:29] Amen. So he kind of
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he represents
[1:13:40] uh the generation that is coming.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it's a privilege to share
[1:13:47] this experience with him.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; It's his experience first time in
[1:13:53] Africa.
[1:13:56] Praise the Lord. So, I'm sure it's quite
[1:13:57] an experience.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things to take in. A
[1:14:03] lot of things to take in.
[1:14:05] A lot of things to adjust to.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm just watching him and
[1:14:12] laughing
[1:14:15] cuz I know Australia
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; and Australians.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; He's a good missionary. He
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; is a good missionary.
[1:14:27] He he's he's doing well. He sometimes he
[1:14:31] turning red in the face
[1:14:34] but he's hanging in there.
[1:14:40] So we appreciate the Lord.
[1:14:43] Amen. And so certainly want to I'll take
[1:14:46] this opportunity to do one naughty
[1:14:48] thing.
[1:14:50] I want to really appreciate the host uh
[1:14:54] brother.
[1:14:57] Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I really appreciate his
[1:15:01] vision for the young people
[1:15:05] to invest much in the generation that's
[1:15:07] coming up.
[1:15:10] Hallelujah.
[1:15:12] Certainly want to appreciate that and
[1:15:15] appreciate the opportunity to be a part
[1:15:16] of this.
[1:15:20] And I want to appreciate all the pastors
[1:15:21] that are here or that have allowed their
[1:15:24] people to come and be here.
[1:15:28] Certainly appreciate that cooperation
[1:15:30] and it's been a pleasure to minister to
[1:15:32] you all.
[1:15:35] Amen. I want to appreciate the ministers
[1:15:38] which are many
[1:15:41] then pastors that would have taken these
[1:15:43] meetings but
[1:15:45] they have preferred us.
[1:15:48] So we want to appreciate them and
[1:15:51] acknowledge them as men of God. Praise
[1:15:53] the Lord.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I will take this opportunity
[1:15:59] as well
[1:16:01] to appreciate all the sisters
[1:16:05] that are married to these brothers,
[1:16:09] to these ministers, to these pastors
[1:16:14] that are married to the deacons.
[1:16:17] that are married to the trustees,
[1:16:21] that are married to the brothers that
[1:16:22] are running around
[1:16:26] in the past week. They have not seen
[1:16:27] their husbands.
[1:16:30] Their children have not seen their
[1:16:32] daddies.
[1:16:34] They come after midnight and they leave
[1:16:36] before 6:00 a.m.
[1:16:41] So they are as much a part of the
[1:16:43] ministry
[1:16:46] as we all are.
[1:16:48] And I want to salute you all sisters.
[1:16:52] May the Lord richly bless you.
[1:16:55] Praise the Lord. And the Lord who sees
[1:16:58] your sacrifices
[1:17:01] will not forget it.
[1:17:04] I pray for abundant blessings on you.
[1:17:08] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; So I want to also acknowledge a precious
[1:17:14] friend.
[1:17:18] A brother who was an older brother to us
[1:17:20] in college,
[1:17:24] brother Patrick.
[1:17:26] Brother, if you can give us a wave.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; That brother there.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; It was an emotional reunion with him
[1:17:36] yesterday.
[1:17:40] There are people you meet in college, in
[1:17:42] life
[1:17:45] and you love them deeply
[1:17:47] and they play a very key role.
[1:17:50] They are very supportive.
[1:17:53] They live a Christian life before you.
[1:17:56] You pray together. You confess to one
[1:17:59] another. you lay hands on each other.
[1:18:04] That is one of those brothers.
[1:18:07] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; So, I really appreciate that brother.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm sure he appreciates what
[1:18:16] the Lord has done in our lives.
[1:18:20] And I'm sure it's also a blessing for
[1:18:22] him to see us travel the world and
[1:18:27] serve the Lord in the way that we are
[1:18:29] doing.
[1:18:32] And I see hasn't changed.
[1:18:35] So I appreciate that. I think I've done
[1:18:38] all the protocol.
[1:18:41] It's taken me close to 10 minutes to do
[1:18:43] that.
[1:18:45] Let's get into the word. How many are
[1:18:47] still expecting?
[1:18:50] Amen. Amen. And I should not forget the
[1:18:52] next phase of my African trip.
[1:18:58] Let me start to pave the way right.
[1:19:02] Special greetings to my Kenyan brothers
[1:19:04] and sisters.
[1:19:12] Hallelujah. Cuz I know that's where I'm
[1:19:14] going. So, you know, you lay the
[1:19:15] groundwork
[1:19:17] so that they can treat you right.
[1:19:22] Brother Isaac is a great man.
[1:19:27] Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Jude chapter one.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; The book of Jude chapter one
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; and we start from verse 17.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know the cameramen yesterday.
[1:19:42] They were a bit naughty. They kept they
[1:19:45] kept the cameras rolling when we were
[1:19:46] really picking up some serious dances.
[1:19:48] Yeah,
[1:19:54] unfortunately with this world, digital
[1:19:56] world,
[1:19:59] the images went very far
[1:20:03] to a big continent
[1:20:09] and the people saw the pastor dancing.
[1:20:13] He had reconnected with the African in
[1:20:15] him.
[1:20:18] All the African moves came out.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And all the Polished
[1:20:25] stuff went out the window.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; But God is good.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jude chapter one starting
[1:20:33] from verse 17.
[1:20:39] But beloved, remember ye the words which
[1:20:41] were spoken before the apostles of our
[1:20:44] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:20:52] How that they told you there should be
[1:20:55] mockers in the last time who should walk
[1:20:58] after their own ungodly lusts.
[1:21:12] These be they who separate themselves
[1:21:15] sensual having not the spirit.
[1:21:24] But ye, beloved, building up yourselves
[1:21:28] on your most holy faith, praying in the
[1:21:31] Holy Ghost,
[1:21:44] Keep yourselves in the love of God,
[1:21:46] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[1:21:49] Christ unto eternal life.
[1:22:00] and of some have compassion making a
[1:22:03] difference.
[1:22:12] And others save with fear, pulling them
[1:22:15] out of the fire, hating even the garment
[1:22:18] spotted by the flesh.
[1:22:37] Now unto him that is able to keep you
[1:22:41] from falling and to present you
[1:22:44] faultless before the presence of his
[1:22:47] glory with exceeding joy to the only
[1:22:51] wise God our Savior be glory and majesty
[1:22:56] dominion and power both now and ever.
[1:22:59] Amen.
[1:23:28] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; The grass fadeth, wither, the flower
[1:23:32] fadeth,
[1:23:35] but the word of our God shall stand
[1:23:37] forever.
[1:23:40] The Lord had blessing to the reading of
[1:23:42] his word.
[1:23:43] You may be seated saints.
[1:23:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:54] I've tried to stay on track on a thought
[1:24:01] that is really precious to me
[1:24:05] which is the thought of perfect
[1:24:06] realization.
[1:24:11] And every minister understands that
[1:24:13] there seasons
[1:24:17] when the Lord places something upon your
[1:24:19] heart
[1:24:22] and you get this perspective on a
[1:24:23] thought,
[1:24:25] you get this other perspective on the
[1:24:27] same thought.
[1:24:32] You get this other perspective on the
[1:24:33] same thought.
[1:24:36] And when you look at your notes and what
[1:24:38] you've been preaching
[1:24:41] in the recent past,
[1:24:44] you realize that unconsciously you've
[1:24:47] been preaching basically around the same
[1:24:50] areas.
[1:24:54] And sometimes
[1:24:56] you take your time to look around,
[1:25:00] you realize that that same thought and
[1:25:02] that same channel,
[1:25:05] the Lord is also dealing with other
[1:25:06] ministers along the same
[1:25:11] and you start to realize that it's like
[1:25:12] the spirit is making something an
[1:25:14] emphasis on this
[1:25:19] to his bride.
[1:25:21] Praise the Lord. Amen. And so this is a
[1:25:23] thought that has been very close to me
[1:25:27] and I've preached quite a number of
[1:25:29] subjects on it
[1:25:31] and I've just tried to put together what
[1:25:34] agrees with the theme and as the Lord I
[1:25:36] felt the Lord leading me
[1:25:41] and I'm thankful to God that uh I felt I
[1:25:46] connected with his spirit to deliver the
[1:25:48] message so far.
[1:25:52] And I pray the same for this morning.
[1:25:56] And I don't want you to worry if you see
[1:25:59] me try to slow down a bit
[1:26:04] and you fear that I'm going to preach
[1:26:06] too long.
[1:26:09] If it happens, it's not by design.
[1:26:15] Amen. I tend to preach my usual no more
[1:26:18] times.
[1:26:22] Praise the Lord. But it's something that
[1:26:24] I feel as I come now to the last service
[1:26:27] that I have to take in these meetings,
[1:26:34] I bring this thought.
[1:26:37] acknowledging the work that the Lord has
[1:26:39] done through the other ministers as well
[1:26:46] that have ministered in this convention.
[1:26:49] I think it's been precious what's been
[1:26:51] planted in us.
[1:26:55] Praise the Lord. How we have spoken
[1:27:00] talking about how men
[1:27:04] lost his relationship
[1:27:08] from the garden
[1:27:11] and as a result of losing his
[1:27:13] relationship.
[1:27:17] He then became disconnected
[1:27:21] from his channel
[1:27:25] of blessing,
[1:27:27] authority,
[1:27:29] protection and all these other things.
[1:27:33] And I prophet in the message fundamental
[1:27:35] foundation for faith.
[1:27:40] It says here now that is the beginning
[1:27:43] of man.
[1:27:46] That's what God gave him power over
[1:27:51] everything on the earth.
[1:27:54] Now through the fall he lost that power.
[1:27:59] Then he becomes unconscious of the FACT
[1:28:07] after losing his relationship and
[1:28:10] friendship
[1:28:15] fellowship with the father.
[1:28:18] He lost that
[1:28:21] and all of his great channels
[1:28:27] become clogged up
[1:28:30] and he couldn't get through.
[1:28:33] Now what Adam was in God
[1:28:38] Christ
[1:28:40] has redeemed us back to that.
[1:28:44] Now a redeemer
[1:28:46] to redeem anything
[1:28:49] is to bring it back to its origin again.
[1:28:56] So when sin entered the garden
[1:29:00] sin caused a separation
[1:29:04] it man lost his relationship and
[1:29:07] friendship and fellowship with God.
[1:29:12] And as a result,
[1:29:15] he lost his CONSCIOUSNESS
[1:29:19] to who he was.
[1:29:22] He became unconscious
[1:29:28] to his rightful position
[1:29:32] as a son of God.
[1:29:34] Are we together? And by losing that
[1:29:37] conscious,
[1:29:39] the prophet says his great CHANNELS
[1:29:45] got clogged up.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They were trying to fix up
[1:29:50] our water situation by the residences
[1:29:52] there
[1:29:56] because the water pressure just wasn't
[1:29:58] enough
[1:30:00] and the plumbers had to come
[1:30:04] and attend to the fault
[1:30:07] and there's many reasons for that
[1:30:10] and sometimes the reason
[1:30:13] is that the piping is clogged up.
[1:30:17] Some foreign material
[1:30:22] has entered into the channel of water
[1:30:26] and is restricted now
[1:30:29] the water flow
[1:30:31] to go where it's supposed to go. And the
[1:30:34] only way you can fix it
[1:30:38] is to come and remove the foreign
[1:30:42] material
[1:30:44] AND CLEAN IT OUT.
[1:30:47] SO THAT THE WATER CAN now flow.
[1:30:52] And the prophet is saying
[1:30:55] when man
[1:30:56] lost his relationship with God,
[1:31:00] HIS CHANNELS
[1:31:03] that connected him to GOD
[1:31:07] AND allowed all these great things
[1:31:11] that made him a true son of God.
[1:31:16] Now remember in the church ages
[1:31:19] I have to drop this even though I'm
[1:31:21] running away I'm running ahead of
[1:31:23] myself.
[1:31:26] In the church ages, the prophet really
[1:31:29] takes his time to EXPLAIN
[1:31:32] that Jesus is the true light.
[1:31:36] Does not mean
[1:31:38] that trueeness. The word truth there
[1:31:43] does not mean that it is void of a lie.
[1:31:50] When he says, "I'm the true bread,"
[1:31:54] he's not trying to say, "I'm not lying.
[1:31:56] I'm telling you the truth."
[1:32:00] But it's got a deeper meaning.
[1:32:05] It is him standing
[1:32:08] IN A POSITION
[1:32:10] OF perfect realization
[1:32:14] AND DECLARING
[1:32:16] THAT I am the light.
[1:32:20] HE'S NOT SAYING IT TO GO contrary to
[1:32:23] lies.
[1:32:26] It's a part of it,
[1:32:29] but it's a deeper meaning.
[1:32:32] It's a being standing in perfect
[1:32:34] realization
[1:32:37] and saying I am.
[1:32:40] THAT'S WHY YOU saw I used that term.
[1:32:43] The channels WERE CLOGGED
[1:32:46] and the the clogging of the CHANNELS
[1:32:50] THEN AFFECTED ADAM
[1:32:54] from being conscious
[1:32:57] of him being a true son of God.
[1:33:02] So in other words, as long as the
[1:33:04] channels are closed,
[1:33:08] he could not be a true son of God
[1:33:12] in the sense that he lost himself the
[1:33:15] perfect realization
[1:33:18] that he was a son of God.
[1:33:23] That's why the things that happened in
[1:33:24] the garden happened.
[1:33:27] That's why they could cover themselves
[1:33:28] WITH FIG LEAVES.
[1:33:31] THAT'S WHY HE WAS AVOIDING the presence
[1:33:33] of God.
[1:33:35] He had lost his connection,
[1:33:38] his relationship.
[1:33:41] Therefore, he was now in a state of
[1:33:43] amnesia.
[1:33:47] Praise the Lord. And for him to be
[1:33:50] restored back,
[1:33:52] God had to carry out a work.
[1:33:57] And that work would be to unclog the
[1:34:00] channels
[1:34:02] and re-establish
[1:34:05] an unrestricted connection
[1:34:10] between himself and his son
[1:34:14] and all this consciousness
[1:34:17] would come back again.
[1:34:21] Are we together in the message? What was
[1:34:24] the Holy Ghost given for?
[1:34:28] Amen. The prophet in paragraph 32 he
[1:34:30] says
[1:34:32] Christ poured himself into the church.
[1:34:37] Therefore now watch
[1:34:40] at that day you will know that I am in
[1:34:43] the father and you are in me
[1:34:50] and I am in you.
[1:34:54] At that day
[1:34:56] you know it
[1:34:59] for the whole thing is one plan of
[1:35:03] redemption coming down
[1:35:10] that God coming back to live in and
[1:35:13] dwell with and commune to his people as
[1:35:18] he did at the beginning.
[1:35:27] Now then, as soon as he gets his church
[1:35:30] in speaking conditions,
[1:35:36] gets his church to a place WHERE HE CAN
[1:35:38] FLOW himself through
[1:35:44] and love
[1:35:46] and persuade
[1:35:49] and fellowship.
[1:35:51] Then there will come an Eden.
[1:35:57] He will TAKE HIS CHURCH BACK TO WHERE it
[1:35:59] left him at
[1:36:04] back to an Eden again.
[1:36:07] There it fell.
[1:36:12] That's where it made its first start
[1:36:17] OR FALL.
[1:36:19] THERE IS where it will be taken right
[1:36:22] BACK
[1:36:25] with every clean slate of redemption,
[1:36:32] bringing them straight back to that
[1:36:35] place again.
[1:36:38] That's the whole plan of redemption.
[1:36:42] God is trying to bring his church
[1:36:46] back to the speaking condition.
[1:36:50] to to a place
[1:36:53] where he himself
[1:36:57] WOULD FLOW THROUGH
[1:37:00] AND LOVE
[1:37:03] AND PERSUADE
[1:37:06] through his people.
[1:37:09] So the plan of redemption
[1:37:12] is to unclog the channels,
[1:37:17] the supernatural channels.
[1:37:21] Hallelujah. SO THAT GOD
[1:37:25] CAN START TO FREELY FLOW
[1:37:29] and be able to love, to fellowship.
[1:37:35] Are we together? AMEN. WITH MEN AGAIN
[1:37:38] THROUGH MEN.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? AMEN. IS IN THAT FIRST
[1:37:43] JOHN WHEN HE SAYS IF WE SHARE WITH YOU
[1:37:46] THESE MYSTERIES
[1:37:49] then we have fellowship with one
[1:37:51] another.
[1:37:53] BUT ACTUALLY OUR FELLOWSHIP
[1:37:56] IS NOT BETWEEN YOU AND I
[1:37:59] BUT IT is between you and God.
[1:38:04] Because now God
[1:38:06] is freely flowing
[1:38:10] through MY SISTER,
[1:38:13] THROUGH MY BROTHER
[1:38:15] AND FLOWING also
[1:38:17] through my other brother AND MY OTHER
[1:38:20] SISTER.
[1:38:22] AND AS they meet together,
[1:38:25] THEN GOD
[1:38:27] IS FLOWING THROUGH
[1:38:29] AND IT IS GOD
[1:38:31] FELLOWSHIPPING WITH GOD.
[1:38:37] AMEN.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; now? WE'VE GOT TO CATCH THAT.
[1:38:42] SO, man lost that consciousness
[1:38:45] and he lost his connection to the
[1:38:47] celestial
[1:38:51] and he became too conscious to the
[1:38:54] terrestrial.
[1:38:58] He lost his sensitivity to the spiritual
[1:39:05] And really God so connected to the
[1:39:07] NATURAL
[1:39:11] and education
[1:39:13] is training the NATURAL
[1:39:17] making the natural mind
[1:39:20] think in a certain way.
[1:39:25] Culture and tradition
[1:39:30] is training the natural man.
[1:39:33] TO BE CONSCIOUS
[1:39:36] OF THEIR NATURAL SELF.
[1:39:38] YOUR parents will tell you you are of
[1:39:41] the Minga tribe.
[1:39:44] YOU ARE OF THIS TRIBE.
[1:39:47] We this people,
[1:39:49] our totem is the crocodile.
[1:39:55] Our totem is the monkey.
[1:39:58] We should act LIKE A MONKEY IN A CERTAIN
[1:40:00] WAY.
[1:40:02] THEY ARE GRILLING IN YOU,
[1:40:05] training your natural SELF
[1:40:09] TO START TO THINK IN A CERTAIN WAY.
[1:40:13] ARE WE TOGETHER? OH, WE ARE THE BIG
[1:40:15] ANIMAL.
[1:40:18] Our totem is the elephant
[1:40:22] and the people are groomed like that.
[1:40:25] AND YOU START TO see in the village they
[1:40:27] start to treat everybody like they are
[1:40:28] SMALL PEOPLE.
[1:40:31] OH, OUR TRIBE
[1:40:33] IS RIGHT at the top level of the
[1:40:37] pyramid.
[1:40:39] Don't ever marry from THIS OTHER TRIBE.
[1:40:43] THEY are not good people. DON'T MARRY
[1:40:46] FROM THAT TRIBE. THEY ARE NOT GOOD
[1:40:49] PEOPLE.
[1:40:50] WOMEN FROM THAT VILLAGE, THEY ARE NOT
[1:40:53] GOOD PEOPLE.
[1:40:55] EVEN IF THEY ARE BELIEVERS,
[1:40:58] DON'T MARRY FROM THAT VILLAGE.
[1:41:01] THEY ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. It is the
[1:41:04] natural MIND
[1:41:06] being trained
[1:41:08] in the culture and tradition
[1:41:12] of humanity.
[1:41:14] ARE WE TOGETHER? THE CHANNELS OF GOD,
[1:41:18] THEY ARE CLOGGED UP AND THE MUSCLES,
[1:41:23] natural muscles,
[1:41:25] NATURAL MENTAL MUSCLES
[1:41:29] ARE BEING DEVELOPED
[1:41:31] AND CONSCIENTIZED
[1:41:34] AND TRAINED TO THINK in a certain way.
[1:41:41] That's why this prophet spoke so much
[1:41:43] against education.
[1:41:46] It's not because he promoted ignorance,
[1:41:50] but he realized that damage that
[1:41:52] education could do.
[1:41:55] Because an educated man
[1:41:58] wants to reason things out,
[1:42:02] wants to think things through
[1:42:05] with his natural mind.
[1:42:08] SO EDUCATION HELPS FURTHER CLOG up the
[1:42:11] CHANNELS
[1:42:13] so that a man is not connected
[1:42:16] spiritually to his maker
[1:42:19] but is more connected to his natural
[1:42:21] faculties.
[1:42:25] But God wants to flow through you.
[1:42:29] And through you, my sister
[1:42:31] and have fellowship with you and have
[1:42:34] fellowship with the other sister.
[1:42:37] And he wants to do it through you.
[1:42:41] And it is through that fellowship
[1:42:44] that God restores Eden again.
[1:42:49] He is working by his word
[1:42:53] to restore us to the place where man was
[1:42:57] perfectly conscious
[1:43:00] that he was a son of God. That his
[1:43:03] thoughts were the thoughts of God. That
[1:43:06] what he spoke was God speaking.
[1:43:09] That the place where God wants to take
[1:43:11] us to.
[1:43:14] Amen. Amen. First Corinthians chapter 2.
[1:43:18] Verse
[1:43:20] 9.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. But as it is
[1:43:34] written, I had not seen,
[1:43:40] nor ear heard,
[1:43:43] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:43:45] men the things which God hath prepared
[1:43:48] for them that love him.
[1:44:00] But God hath revealed them unto us by
[1:44:03] his spirit.
[1:44:08] For the spirit searchth all things,
[1:44:12] yay, the deep things of God.
[1:44:16] For what man knoweth the things of a
[1:44:19] man?
[1:44:23] save the spirit of man which is in him.
[1:44:28] Even so the things of God knoweth no
[1:44:31] man,
[1:44:34] but the spirit of God.
[1:44:37] Now we have received
[1:44:40] not the spirit of the world, but the
[1:44:42] spirit which is of God,
[1:44:48] that we might know the things that are
[1:44:51] freely given to us of God,
[1:44:57] which things also we speak, not in the
[1:45:00] words which men's wisdom teacheth,
[1:45:08] But which the Holy Ghost teacheth,
[1:45:12] comparing spiritual things with
[1:45:14] spiritual,
[1:45:18] but the natural man
[1:45:21] receiveth not that things of the spirit
[1:45:24] of God,
[1:45:27] for they are foolishness unto him,
[1:45:32] neither can he know them
[1:45:36] because they are spiritually discerned.
[1:45:42] But he that is spiritual
[1:45:46] judgeth all things.
[1:45:49] Yet he himself
[1:45:52] is judged of no man.
[1:45:55] For who hath known the mind of the Lord
[1:46:00] that he may instruct him?
[1:46:04] But we have the mind of Christ.
[1:46:08] Spiritual things
[1:46:10] are spiritually discerned.
[1:46:13] No natural man.
[1:46:17] No matter how intelligent they are
[1:46:21] is able
[1:46:23] to discern
[1:46:24] the spiritual things. You are you have
[1:46:28] to know that.
[1:46:31] You are not going TO FEEL
[1:46:34] in the natural.
[1:46:36] And because of the feeling in THE
[1:46:38] NATURAL
[1:46:40] THEN YOU ARE ABLE TO DISCERN
[1:46:43] SPIRITUAL THINGS. You are not going to
[1:46:46] REASON
[1:46:47] IN THE natural and ADD THIS AND THAT
[1:46:52] AND COME UP WITH that conclusion
[1:46:56] in the natural mind and design correctly
[1:47:01] the things of God.
[1:47:04] Because the NATURAL MIND
[1:47:06] AND THIS natural body without the spirit
[1:47:11] is clogged up.
[1:47:16] Are we together? So the only way
[1:47:20] you can discern SPIRITUAL THINGS
[1:47:23] IS by the spirit of God
[1:47:26] which BRINGS
[1:47:28] THE MIND OF CHRIST
[1:47:31] INTO the individual.
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. Romans chapter 8. Oh, don't
[1:47:37] worry. You think I'll start preaching?
[1:47:38] I'm preaching right now.
[1:47:41] If you are tying your shoelaces is
[1:47:43] waiting for the moment,
[1:47:47] you might miss it because next thing you
[1:47:50] hear me closing.
[1:47:53] Now if you are busy tying up your
[1:47:55] shoelaces, tucking up your shirt,
[1:48:00] straightening up so that now when he
[1:48:03] comes to the interesting part now my
[1:48:05] eyes can open up
[1:48:08] you might miss it because I'm preaching
[1:48:10] RIGHT NOW.
[1:48:13] I'm not jumping but I am preaching.
[1:48:17] And he who had the spirit
[1:48:20] will hear what the spirit is saying.
[1:48:25] Are we together? Because we need to know
[1:48:28] where we are standing
[1:48:31] and we need to take everything that we
[1:48:33] have been taught in this convention
[1:48:37] and be able to rightly apply it.
[1:48:42] The problem is
[1:48:45] we live in a microwave age.
[1:48:50] We live in an instant
[1:48:55] instant noodles.
[1:49:05] There's
[1:49:08] there's the brand of noodles that is
[1:49:10] world famous.
[1:49:11] What is that?
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Indomi. That's right. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:18] We live in the world of instant noodles.
[1:49:23] We live in the age of instant coffee.
[1:49:27] We live in the age of microwaves.
[1:49:34] One minute.
[1:49:36] It is steaming. Then you eat it.
[1:49:41] We live in an age where test cricket is
[1:49:45] losing popularity
[1:49:48] because people don't have the patience
[1:49:50] to sit for three days
[1:49:54] watching one single match.
[1:49:58] These are the years of T20
[1:50:03] cricket
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; knock the ball OUT OF THE STADIUM.
[1:50:10] IN TWO HOURS the match is finished.
[1:50:14] These are the days of fast cars.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; 300 horsepower,
[1:50:22] powerful machines
[1:50:25] that can travel.
[1:50:27] These are the days of supersonic travel.
[1:50:32] People used to take months and months
[1:50:37] to travel across the seas
[1:50:40] to reach another continent.
[1:50:43] BUT NOW BY JET TRAVEL,
[1:50:46] you can call them in the morning
[1:50:49] and tell them that please prepare
[1:50:51] supper.
[1:50:53] I'm going to be home. AND AS SURE AS
[1:50:56] anything
[1:50:58] by the evening time, you are seated with
[1:51:01] your family.
[1:51:03] having supper. BUT THE PROBLEM
[1:51:07] IS THAT that whole MENTALITY
[1:51:11] start to filter through
[1:51:14] to our minds
[1:51:16] and we think God
[1:51:19] is also moving at the same pace.
[1:51:23] You think God is going to microwave you.
[1:51:28] You think God is going to instant coffee
[1:51:30] you.
[1:51:35] Are we together? This is the DAY
[1:51:39] WHEN people can't wait to get married.
[1:51:44] THEY CAN'T WAIT
[1:51:47] ALREADY. WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG TEENAGERS,
[1:51:50] they know NOTHING ABOUT LIFE.
[1:51:54] THEY ARE ALREADY thinking of boys,
[1:51:57] already thinking of girls.
[1:51:59] They have NO JOB,
[1:52:02] NO MONEY,
[1:52:04] NO HOUSE,
[1:52:06] NO FUTURE.
[1:52:08] THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF A
[1:52:10] FAMILY.
[1:52:12] THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHARACTER, BUT THEY
[1:52:14] WANT TO GET MARRIED.
[1:52:19] Are we together? Young people, give me
[1:52:22] an amen.
[1:52:28] You see that that's that's a danger
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; and people don't want even young
[1:52:34] MINISTERS
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; do not want to sit under leadership.
[1:52:41] They they just HAVE A LITTLE GIFT
[1:52:44] AND THEY GET APPRECIATED BY THE PEOPLE.
[1:52:48] THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR own church.
[1:52:50] THEY THEY START TO WALK LIKE A PEACOCK.
[1:52:58] HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO PASTOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY
[1:53:02] HAVE NOT been pastored themselves.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; It is the blind leading the blind,
[1:53:13] no experience,
[1:53:15] no experience,
[1:53:17] no revelation,
[1:53:19] NO CHARACTER. BUT PEOPLE WANT TO BELIEVE
[1:53:22] IT.
[1:53:25] ARE WE TOGETHER? But we have TO BE
[1:53:28] ESTABLISHED
[1:53:30] IN THE FAITH
[1:53:32] TO KNOW THAT THE THINGS OF GOD,
[1:53:36] THE BIBLE SAYS, GOD COULD HAVE TAKEN
[1:53:39] THEM BY THE WAY OF PHILISTINE
[1:53:43] to the promised land. ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:53:47] BUT HE CHOSE
[1:53:49] TO TAKE THEM THROUGH THE WILDERNESS.
[1:53:58] OH,
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; church is no monkeyastics.
[1:54:05] Church is no DISCO
[1:54:08] where you say DJ give us
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; church
[1:54:25] IS THE PLACE WHERE EVEN IF YOU are a
[1:54:28] company director,
[1:54:31] you come to an uneducated pastor
[1:54:36] and he tells you to sit down.
[1:54:41] PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; CHURCH IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU MAY HAVE A
[1:54:47] LOT OF MONEY
[1:54:49] and the pastor is wearing shoes that
[1:54:52] that have got the toes STICKING OUT.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WITH THOSE SHOES
[1:54:59] KICKING OUT LIKE THIS,
[1:55:01] HE TELLS YOU TO SIT DOWN
[1:55:04] WITH YOUR CROCODILE SKIN SHOES
[1:55:08] AND LISTEN to a word.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; We live in a microwave age.
[1:55:26] BUT GOD HAS GOT A BRIDE.
[1:55:29] HALLELUJAH. God has got a bride. She's
[1:55:33] not caught
[1:55:35] by the spirit of the age.
[1:55:38] She has character.
[1:55:41] She has patience.
[1:55:43] She has virtue.
[1:55:46] She's no ski milk.
[1:55:50] She's tough.
[1:55:53] She doesn't need a greenhouse
[1:55:56] and be sprayed up
[1:55:58] and temperature increased.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's tough.
[1:56:05] She can stand pressure.
[1:56:08] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. SHE'S STRONG. SHE CAN
[1:56:12] BE REBUKED
[1:56:14] AND NEXT SUNDAY COME BACK TO CHURCH.
[1:56:24] Not these people that are rebuked THIS
[1:56:26] TIME
[1:56:27] AND THEY STOP COMING TO CHURCH.
[1:56:31] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Oh brother,
[1:56:34] GOD NEEDS TOUGH PEOPLE.
[1:56:37] COME RAIN, COME
[1:56:40] SHOES OR NO SHOES,
[1:56:43] I WILL WORSHIP my God.
[1:56:49] Oh, you may be seated, saints.
[1:56:54] You may be seated, saints. You are
[1:56:57] getting me in a straight I don't want to
[1:56:59] get to too soon.
[1:57:04] You don't know how many times I prayed
[1:57:05] in my room. Lord, don't get me get
[1:57:07] carried away.
[1:57:09] Don't allow me to get carried away.
[1:57:14] Amen. I'm not used to this level of
[1:57:16] energy.
[1:57:18] So, you trigger too much the African in
[1:57:20] me.
[1:57:22] You see me standing on this building.
[1:57:30] Hallelujah.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; I've done it before.
[1:57:36] I was preaching at a shopping mall.
[1:57:39] The next minute I was on top of
[1:57:41] somebody,
[1:57:44] stepped on HIS CAR
[1:57:47] TO HIM
[1:57:51] AND AFTER I PREACHED TO HIM, HE SHOOK MY
[1:57:54] HEAD,
[1:57:56] THANK YOU.
[1:58:04] BECAUSE IT WAS THE SPIRIT
[1:58:06] THAT TOOK ME THERE.
[1:58:10] Because if it is excitement,
[1:58:13] you can receive the five-fold ministry.
[1:58:22] Don't work on excitement.
[1:58:25] You lose your teeth.
[1:58:37] They will rearrange your frankly
[1:58:44] the infallible proof of the
[1:58:46] resurrection.
[1:58:50] The sin questions is settled.
[1:58:55] When the Holy Spirit comes into the
[1:58:57] human heart,
[1:59:00] it casts down reasoning,
[1:59:05] it goes above our intellectual approach.
[1:59:12] NOW today the reason so many ups and
[1:59:15] downs and things enter the religious
[1:59:17] PEOPLE
[1:59:22] is because there's an intellectual
[1:59:25] conception of Christ.
[1:59:30] In other words,
[1:59:32] it's in their mind,
[1:59:37] not in their heart.
[1:59:39] You see
[1:59:41] they just mentally believe it
[1:59:46] and your mental will reason.
[1:59:53] Could it be so?
[1:59:55] Could divine healing be so?
[1:59:58] Could the baptism of the spirit be so?
[2:00:02] Now that's intellectual reason.
[2:00:08] BUT WHEN that comes into the heart,
[2:00:12] IT'S A FAITH.
[2:00:14] IT'S a positive.
[2:00:17] There is no question at all about it.
[2:00:22] It's all settled forever.
[2:00:27] It's in your heart
[2:00:29] and your heart doesn't reason
[2:00:34] because it's the throne.
[2:00:37] Where is that? Where is that?
[2:00:41] THE DWELLING PLACE
[2:00:44] of the almighty
[2:00:47] heart.
[2:00:50] So you can have a CONCEPTION
[2:00:54] of what is being PREACHED
[2:00:58] is a mental conception.
[2:01:03] THE WORD CONCEPTION
[2:01:06] THE PROPHET uses it a lot
[2:01:09] and I know you might know it
[2:01:12] and the architect amongst us
[2:01:15] would explain it better
[2:01:18] but A CONCEPT
[2:01:21] IS THE FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK
[2:01:27] on which you build everything.
[2:01:30] ARE WE TOGETHER? OR A CONCEPT
[2:01:34] OF THIS WALL
[2:01:37] THE FOUNDATIONAL DRAWING
[2:01:40] GIVES THIS BUILDING
[2:01:43] DIMENSIONS
[2:01:47] IT LAYOUT
[2:01:50] AND THEN ALL THE OTHER FINER DETAILS
[2:01:54] come after the CONCEPT
[2:01:59] THE FINER DETAILS
[2:02:09] SO IF YOU HAVE A WRONG CONCEPT,
[2:02:12] YOU CANNOT get the final details.
[2:02:17] SO YOUR CONCEPT HAS GOT TO BE RIGHT.
[2:02:22] THE FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK IS HAS GOT TO
[2:02:26] BE RIGHT.
[2:02:29] THE FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK
[2:02:32] HAS GOT TO BE
[2:02:34] AND THEN YOU BUILD ON IT.
[2:02:37] IF YOU HAVE A MENTAL CONCERN,
[2:02:41] YOU ARE GOING TO CONSTRUCT A MENTAL
[2:02:44] STRUCTURE
[2:02:50] the righteousness of God.
[2:02:55] IF YOUR CONCEPT
[2:02:57] IS A REVELATION CONCEPTUAL
[2:03:02] CONCEPT
[2:03:04] CAN STAND
[2:03:06] PRESIST,
[2:03:19] if I was to come
[2:03:22] and give each one of you
[2:03:24] a blank piece of paper
[2:03:28] and say, "My sister, here's a blank
[2:03:30] piece of paper. My brother, here's
[2:03:32] another one. My brother, there's another
[2:03:34] one. My brother, there's another." And I
[2:03:38] would give you an array of colored
[2:03:40] pencils.
[2:03:43] And I would ask EACH ONE OF YOU
[2:03:46] TO draw
[2:03:48] what you think God looks like.
[2:03:54] ARE we together? Do you know how many
[2:03:57] pictures?
[2:04:00] THREE CREATURES
[2:04:04] that that we would get.
[2:04:08] Are we together? It would be hard for
[2:04:11] you
[2:04:13] to draw a god who looks like a kangaroo
[2:04:18] because there's no kangaroo.
[2:04:20] And you might draw something
[2:04:23] that looks like a monkey
[2:04:26] because you you you have seen monkey.
[2:04:29] YOU MAY DRAW SOMETHING THAT looks like a
[2:04:32] green
[2:04:35] because you have seen it.
[2:04:37] And so your CONCEPT
[2:04:41] IS informed by what you know.
[2:04:47] And the choice OF COLORS
[2:04:50] WOULD BE INFORMED
[2:04:52] BY THE colors that you know.
[2:04:59] You are not going to pick COLORS YOU
[2:05:00] DON'T KNOW
[2:05:02] AND PICK VIOLET VIOLET and
[2:05:07] where did you SEE THEM? YOU ARE GOING TO
[2:05:09] TAKE COLORS THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU LEAVE
[2:05:12] AROUND
[2:05:14] YOU DRAW WHATEVER you draw
[2:05:16] because it's informed by your
[2:05:18] environment.
[2:05:22] ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT GOD IS NOT LIKE
[2:05:27] THAT.
[2:05:29] YOU CANNOT catch him with your natural
[2:05:31] mind.
[2:05:33] WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES
[2:05:36] TO PRAY,
[2:05:38] WHAT IS THE PICTURE THAT COMES TO YOU?
[2:05:41] I WOULD LIKE TO think you imagine
[2:05:42] something.
[2:05:45] It can be blank like that.
[2:05:49] When you pray, do you SEE BLANK LIKE
[2:05:51] THAT?
[2:05:54] OR IN YOUR HEAD SOMETHING COMES UP
[2:05:59] THIS IMAGE
[2:06:01] THAT YOU HAVE CREATED.
[2:06:04] BUT WHEN YOU IN THE DEPTH OF PRAYER,
[2:06:07] YOU START TO SEE THAT MAYBE YOU SEE
[2:06:10] YOURSELF
[2:06:11] WALKING AND YOU'RE A VERY SMALL PERSON
[2:06:15] STANDING IN FRONT
[2:06:17] OF A big
[2:06:19] God.
[2:06:21] WITH WHITE HAIR,
[2:06:24] BLUE EYES
[2:06:26] BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE missionaries
[2:06:27] told him.
[2:06:33] Does he have hair like YOUR HAIR?
[2:06:37] OH, HE has flowing hair
[2:06:40] because that's the pictures you GREW UP
[2:06:42] LOOKING AT
[2:06:44] ALL YOUR LIFE. YOUR GOD CANNOT LOOK LIKE
[2:06:47] AN AFRICAN.
[2:06:50] THOSE ARE NOT THE PICTURES
[2:06:52] YOU GREW UP SEEING.
[2:06:54] YOU WERE BRAINWASHED
[2:06:57] TO think God looks a certain way.
[2:07:01] His hair is a certain way.
[2:07:04] HIS NOSE IS A CERTAIN WAY. HIS LIPS ARE
[2:07:07] A CERTAIN WAY. WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU
[2:07:11] CLOSE YOUR EYES?
[2:07:14] You're going quiet on me now.
[2:07:17] You're going QUIET TO ME NOW. I'M GOING
[2:07:19] TO RUB IT IN.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going TO RUB IT IN.
[2:07:26] YOU SEE, WHATEVER YOU ARE IMAGINING,
[2:07:31] LET me tell you today is a mental
[2:07:35] concept.
[2:07:38] IT'S INFORMED BY SO MANY THINGS
[2:07:42] AND NONE SOMETIMES NONE OF THOSE THINGS.
[2:07:47] IS CORRECTION. IT'S PROPAGANDA,
[2:07:51] is indoctrination,
[2:07:54] is brainwashing.
[2:07:57] WHATEVER YOU ARE BUILDING
[2:07:59] IS A CONGLOMERATION
[2:08:02] OF YOUR OWN PERCEPTION
[2:08:04] AND COMPLEXES,
[2:08:07] superiority complex,
[2:08:10] INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND WHATEVER ELSE IS
[2:08:13] IN BETWEEN.
[2:08:15] FORMS THAT IMAGE.
[2:08:18] GOD IS GREATER SINGER THAN YOUR MENTAL
[2:08:22] CONCEPTION.
[2:08:26] HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE TRYING TO IMAGINE GOD with your
[2:08:34] natural mind.
[2:08:38] THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE GOT THE godhead
[2:08:40] wrong like WAS PREACHED LAST NIGHT
[2:08:42] BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND GOD
[2:08:46] WITH THE NATURAL MIND.
[2:08:48] YOU CANNOT
[2:08:50] YOU NEED THE SPIRIT
[2:08:54] the proof of his resurrection
[2:08:57] and MAN IN HIS OWN MENTAL WAY OF THINK
[2:09:02] is wrong TO BEGIN WITH.
[2:09:06] HE is an alien to God.
[2:09:12] YOU AND I,
[2:09:15] YOU AND I AS NATURAL HUMAN BEING
[2:09:20] IN OUR OWN MENTAL WAY OF THINKING
[2:09:25] is wrong TO BEGIN WITH
[2:09:28] AND IT IS ALIEN TO GOD.
[2:09:32] IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS NOTHING like God.
[2:09:39] HE IS CUT OFF
[2:09:41] WITHOUT hope without God, without mercy.
[2:09:47] AND THE ONLY THING
[2:09:50] THAT HE CAN DO IS COME TO accept Christ.
[2:09:56] AND THEN THE HOLY SPIRIT
[2:10:00] COMES IN
[2:10:02] AND THE MIND
[2:10:05] THAT WAS IN CHRIST
[2:10:08] IS in you.
[2:10:12] JESUS SAID, "THE FATHER THAT SENT ME
[2:10:17] is with me." Oh my, what a declaration.
[2:10:23] WHAT A WORD.
[2:10:25] A FATHER THAT SENT ME
[2:10:28] COME WITH ME.
[2:10:31] LISTEN.
[2:10:32] AND AS GOD SENT ME,
[2:10:35] SO DO I send you.
[2:10:38] HE DON'T ONLY SEND YOU,
[2:10:41] BUT HE GOES WITH YOU.
[2:10:45] I'LL be with you.
[2:10:47] EVEN IN IT UNTO THE END OF THE WORLD
[2:10:53] THAT WAS IN GOD.
[2:10:55] ALL THAT WAS IN GOD
[2:10:58] WAS POURED OUT IN CHRIST AND ALL THAT
[2:11:01] WAS
[2:11:04] EMPTIED
[2:11:06] OUT INTO THE RIVER
[2:11:09] THE CHURCH. GOD IS WITH YOU.
[2:11:13] OH, I AM WITH YOU
[2:11:17] even to the END OF THE WORLD.
[2:11:20] THAT'S THE DECLARATION
[2:11:23] OF GOD'S WORD.
[2:11:25] WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS,
[2:11:28] THAT'S WHAT I believe.
[2:11:32] Amen.
[2:11:35] HALLELUJAH.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WITHOUT THE SPIRIT
[2:11:40] WHICH BRINGS THE MIND OF CHRIST,
[2:11:43] IN THE NATURAL MAN
[2:11:46] you can be pious,
[2:11:48] you can BE ZEALOUS.
[2:11:50] YOU CAN BE HAPPY. YOU CAN SHOUT. YOU CAN
[2:11:53] OPERATE.
[2:11:55] YOU CAN PREACH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:11:58] BUT YOU HAVE A WRONG
[2:12:01] OF GOD AND A WRONG CONCEPT OF GOD.
[2:12:06] ONLY GO SO FAR.
[2:12:12] ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT A RIGHT CONCEPT
[2:12:16] YOU ALL.
[2:12:20] AMEN. Philippians chapter 2
[2:12:23] verse 5. Let this mind BE IN YOU
[2:12:28] WHICH was also IN CHRIST
[2:12:32] JESUS.
[2:12:33] WHO BEING IN THE FORM OF GOD,
[2:12:37] thought it not ROBBERY
[2:12:39] TO BE equal with God,
[2:12:42] BUT MADE HIMSELF
[2:12:44] OF NO REPUTATION,
[2:12:47] AND TOOK UPON HIM
[2:12:49] THE FORM OF A SERVANT,
[2:12:52] AND WAS MADE
[2:12:54] IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN, AND BEING FOUND
[2:12:57] IN FLESH AS A MAN,
[2:13:01] LIKE YOU AND I,
[2:13:03] HE HUMBLED himself
[2:13:06] and became OBEDIENT
[2:13:09] UNTO DEATH.
[2:13:11] EVEN THE death of the cross,
[2:13:14] he became obedient
[2:13:17] UNTO DEATH. NOT JUST AN ORDINARY DEATH,
[2:13:22] BUT THE DEATH OF THE CROSS, A VIOLENT
[2:13:27] DEATH AND ROMAN CAPITAL.
[2:13:32] SHAME. SHAMED BEFORE THE PEOPLE,
[2:13:37] CRUCIFIED
[2:13:38] LIKE A COMMON CRIMINAL
[2:13:41] TAKEN CLOTHES OFF, CLOTHES TAKEN OFF,
[2:13:46] NAKED
[2:13:47] ON THE CROSS BEFORE HIS DISCIPLES.
[2:13:53] HE DID NOT THINK OF IT AS PROPER
[2:13:57] TO BE EQUAL WITH GOD.
[2:14:00] HE COULD HUMBLE HIMSELF.
[2:14:03] HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:05] HIMSELF
[2:14:07] AND DIE THE DEATH
[2:14:10] EVEN THE DEATH OF THE CROSS.
[2:14:13] THAT'S no natural man.
[2:14:16] AMEN.
[2:14:18] MIND OF CHRIST.
[2:14:21] THEREFORE, GOD ALSO HAS highly exalted
[2:14:25] HIM
[2:14:27] AND GIVEN HIM A NAME
[2:14:29] WHICH IS ABOVE EVERYTHING
[2:14:32] THAT AT THE NAME OF JESUS
[2:14:35] EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW
[2:14:38] IN HEAVEN AND THINGS
[2:14:42] AND THINGS
[2:14:44] AND THAT EVERY TONGUE
[2:14:47] SHOULD CONFESS. I PRAY THAT JESUS CHRIST
[2:14:51] IS LORD TO THE GLORY OF THE LORD.
[2:14:57] HE IS WALKING IN A PLACE OF PERFECT
[2:15:02] REALIZATION
[2:15:04] THAT HE IS EQUAL WITH GOD.
[2:15:08] THERE'S NO SHADOW OF DOUBT
[2:15:12] EVEN IN HIM THAT HE IS EQUAL WITH GOD.
[2:15:17] AND YET EVEN WITH THAT REALIZATION
[2:15:21] THERE'S NO PRIDE IN HIM.
[2:15:24] THERE'S NO POMPOUSNESS IN HIM. THERE'S
[2:15:27] NO AIR ABOUT YOU.
[2:15:30] HE CAN HUMBLE HIMSELF
[2:15:33] TO THE LOWEST
[2:15:35] CRIMINALS
[2:15:37] TO THE LOWEST OF SINNERS.
[2:15:41] HE CAN LIVE AS IF HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
[2:15:47] THE MOVEMENT OF HIS FINGER.
[2:15:50] HE CAN CALL THE ARMIES OF HEAVEN
[2:15:53] AND DESTROY EVERYTHING.
[2:15:56] HE CAN LOOK DOWN
[2:15:58] ALLOW ROMAN SOLDIERS
[2:16:02] UNGODLY SINNERS
[2:16:05] TO HIT HIM ON THE HEAD TO PUSH HIM
[2:16:08] AROUND AND HUMBLY WALK
[2:16:12] IN THE HUMBLY WALK WITHOUTATION.
[2:16:17] EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS
[2:16:19] HE IS GOD
[2:16:21] IN FLESH.
[2:16:23] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:27] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:31] HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, if it is some of our
[2:16:35] brothers and sisters,
[2:16:41] they are going to say, "You pushed me
[2:16:42] too far.
[2:16:46] You pushed me too far."
[2:16:50] Brother says, "You closed the line."
[2:16:51] That's right.
[2:16:54] From now you will look like a gorilla.
[2:17:03] How we together? You have a tail like a
[2:17:07] baboon.
[2:17:16] But his purpose
[2:17:18] was more important.
[2:17:22] THAN political point scoring.
[2:17:28] Now that's the mind of Christ.
[2:17:32] That is being like Jesus.
[2:17:40] He knew who he was
[2:17:42] when he went to the cross.
[2:17:46] In the book of John, he makes so many
[2:17:49] declarations
[2:17:51] before his crucifixion.
[2:17:53] Do you LOVE TO READ THE BIBLE?
[2:17:56] LET'S READ SOME OF THE DECLARATIONS.
[2:17:59] BROTHERS, if you help me with the
[2:18:00] projector,
[2:18:02] we want to have a snapshot of THE BOOK
[2:18:04] OF JOHN.
[2:18:06] JOHN CHAPTER 6 verse 35.
[2:18:10] Jesus said unto them,
[2:18:13] I AM the bread OF LIFE,
[2:18:17] HE that cometh to me shall never hunger.
[2:18:22] And he that believeth on me SHALL NEVER
[2:18:25] THIRST. JOHN CHAPTER 8 verse 12. Then
[2:18:31] Jesus spake again unto them,
[2:18:34] saying, I am the light of the world.
[2:18:38] YE that followeth me,
[2:18:41] shall not walk in darkness,
[2:18:44] BUT SHALL have the light of life.
[2:18:48] The Pharisees therefore SAID UNTO HIM,
[2:18:51] "THOU BEAREEST RECORD of thyself,
[2:18:56] thy record is NOT TRUE."
[2:19:00] The Pharisees GOT TIRED
[2:19:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:19:06] humbly declaring his position.
[2:19:10] And just like with any human being,
[2:19:13] if someone stands here and say I'm a
[2:19:15] true son of God,
[2:19:18] if I would have come and stood here and
[2:19:22] my first statement
[2:19:24] would have been, YOU SEE ME THE WAY I
[2:19:27] AM, I am a man of God.
[2:19:31] Some of you would have walked out.
[2:19:35] This is coming with an attitude
[2:19:40] man of God.
[2:19:42] Come on.
[2:19:48] It's human attitude.
[2:19:51] Amen. WE RESENT
[2:19:55] PEOPLE who are too sure of themselves.
[2:20:04] WE HUMAN BEINGS RESENT
[2:20:07] PEOPLE WHO ARE too sure of themselves.
[2:20:11] I will tell you
[2:20:13] I'm A PASTOR pastoring a lot of PEOPLE
[2:20:17] OF different social CLASSES
[2:20:21] and educational qualifications.
[2:20:25] Sometimes for someone TO CALL ME PASTOR,
[2:20:28] IT'S LIKE THEY are swallowing a golf
[2:20:30] ball.
[2:20:38] Pastor
[2:20:48] or they will never say my pastor.
[2:20:52] Oh Lord, bless the pastor of this
[2:20:54] church.
[2:20:57] The pastor of this church.
[2:21:04] I'm I'm just sitting AND
[2:21:08] PRIDE.
[2:21:10] They can't say God bless OUR PASTOR.
[2:21:13] GOD BLESS my pastor.
[2:21:16] It's too much for them.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Our the
[2:21:29] liberty to say it. I'm away from home.
[2:21:33] But people have got big heads.
[2:21:37] They are improper fractions.
[2:21:52] The Pharisees were OFFENDED
[2:21:55] when the Lord Jesus Christ was declaring
[2:21:58] his position.
[2:22:01] If the PASTOR COMES AND STANDS
[2:22:04] AND HE SAYS THIS is the vision that I
[2:22:06] have
[2:22:08] vision
[2:22:11] whose VISION
[2:22:20] they said to Moses, you think too much
[2:22:23] of yourself.
[2:22:26] Are you the ONLY MAN OF GOD HERE?
[2:22:32] YOU THINK THOSE ATTITUDES STARTED TODAY?
[2:22:36] People die but spirits don't die.
[2:22:42] PEOPLE DIE
[2:22:44] AND ARE DEAD.
[2:22:46] BUT THEY ARE SPIRITS ARE STILL HERE.
[2:22:54] I I I don't know if I will have MY LUNCH
[2:22:57] TODAY.
[2:23:06] PRAISE THE LORD. Do you know that's the
[2:23:09] reason why tithe paying is now a
[2:23:11] problem?
[2:23:16] THAT'S THE REASON
[2:23:18] people no longer believe in paying.
[2:23:24] Pay tithe to who?
[2:23:33] Yeah.
[2:23:35] Oh, THE MAN OF GOD. WHO'S not a man of
[2:23:38] God?
[2:23:41] WHO WHO
[2:23:43] IS NOT A MAN OF GOD?
[2:23:46] I'M GOING TO TAKE MY TITHES
[2:23:48] AND I'M GOING TO GIVE TO THE POOR.
[2:23:52] I'M GOING TO TAKE MY TITHE
[2:23:54] AND I'M GOING TO HELP THE POOR PEOPLE.
[2:23:58] NOT THAT PASTOR WHO'S driving a nice
[2:24:00] car.
[2:24:13] ARE WE TOGETHER? YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE
[2:24:17] IT HAS always been a revelation.
[2:24:23] TITHE
[2:24:24] WERE PAID.
[2:24:27] BEFORE THE LAW of Moses.
[2:24:31] THE FIRST PERSON
[2:24:33] TO PAY TIED
[2:24:36] BY REVELATION
[2:24:39] in the correct way.
[2:24:47] THE LAW OF MOSES
[2:24:49] CAME TO AFFIRM
[2:24:52] THE REVELATION of Abraham.
[2:25:10] YOU WERE JUMPING WHEN WE WERE TELLING
[2:25:12] YOU THAT YOU ARE SONS and daughters.
[2:25:18] YOU WERE JUMPING.
[2:25:20] NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REVELATION.
[2:25:23] PAY TI. YOU ARE CLOSING YOUR MOUTH.
[2:25:27] WHAT YOU SAY? YOU BELIEVE THIS BIBLE
[2:25:31] FROM COVER TO COVER.
[2:25:39] Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, PRAY FOR ME.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M FEELING good right now.
[2:25:52] People now believe all kinds of things.
[2:25:56] They now believe in donating to the
[2:25:58] church.
[2:26:03] I donated
[2:26:07] Oh brothers,
[2:26:09] God help us.
[2:26:12] And if you pay your tithes LIKE THAT,
[2:26:15] I'M NOT speaking to these pastors.
[2:26:19] I'm not speaking on their behalf.
[2:26:23] BUT AS FOR ME,
[2:26:25] IF SOMEONE IS paying tithes without
[2:26:27] revelation,
[2:26:29] I don't want them to pay tithes. I don't
[2:26:32] want THEM TO PAY TITHE.
[2:26:36] BECAUSE ONE DAY THEY WILL COME WITH a
[2:26:39] whole print OUT
[2:26:46] and say, "I finally stopped believing.
[2:26:52] I need a refund."
[2:27:00] YEAH. BECAUSE IT'S PAINFUL.
[2:27:03] GOOD DAY. IF YOU DO IT IN the flesh,
[2:27:08] LET'S BE HONEST, BROTHERS. LET'S BE
[2:27:11] HONEST, SISTER. IF YOU DO IT IN THE
[2:27:14] FLESH,
[2:27:16] OH, it's painful.
[2:27:23] IF IN YOUR MIND
[2:27:26] YOU THINK IT'S MY MONEY
[2:27:28] THAT I'M GIVING TO THE CHURCH,
[2:27:32] IF THAT'S HOW YOU PROCESS IT,
[2:27:35] IT'S GOING TO BE PAINFUL.
[2:27:37] BUT IF IN YOUR HEART,
[2:27:40] IT WAS NEVER YOURS.
[2:27:43] IT IS THE LORD'S MONEY.
[2:27:46] IN YOUR HEART.
[2:27:48] IT IS WORSHIP.
[2:27:51] NOT THE WORSHIP OF THE PERSON,
[2:27:54] NOT THE WORSHIP OF THE MEN OF
[2:27:57] THE WORSHIP OF GOD
[2:28:00] WHO HAS PROVIDED ME
[2:28:03] AND GIVEN ME HEALTH,
[2:28:05] GIVEN ME STRENGTH,
[2:28:07] BLESSED ME, PROMOTED ME, PROSPERED MY
[2:28:11] BUSINESS.
[2:28:13] HALLELUJAH. AND IT BLESSED ME. I'M
[2:28:17] EARNING MONEY
[2:28:21] FOR
[2:28:23] I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE
[2:28:25] NOT MY
[2:28:28] GOD
[2:28:36] have nothing to DO WITH THE PASTOR
[2:28:39] OF GOD.
[2:28:41] DON'T SERVE THE PASTOR.
[2:28:43] WHEN I DO ANYTHING FOR THE PASTOR
[2:28:46] DOING IT for God,
[2:28:52] that's the correct revelation.
[2:28:55] God never SAID TO ABRAHAM,
[2:28:58] "GIVE ME YOUR TITHE."
[2:29:00] ABRAHAM WENT TO BATTLE
[2:29:03] 318
[2:29:06] SERVANTS AND HE FOUGHT KINGDOM
[2:29:10] AND HE TRAINED ARMIES
[2:29:12] AND HE PROSPERED
[2:29:14] AND HE CONQUERED AND HE WAS ABLE TO SEE
[2:29:18] THAT MY VICTORY
[2:29:21] AND NOT BECAUSE OF MY ABILITY
[2:29:23] THE HAND OF GOD
[2:29:26] UPON ME. WHAT CAN I DO TO ACKNOWLEDGE
[2:29:31] HIS BLESSING ON ME? WHAT CAN I DO TO
[2:29:35] ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE'S BEEN WITH ME?
[2:29:39] ALL THESE THINGS THAT I HAVE SPOILED
[2:29:43] AS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
[2:29:46] THAT IT WAS GOD WILL
[2:29:49] TAKE 10%
[2:29:51] AND GIVE UNTO ME
[2:29:54] THE PRIEST OF THE HIGH
[2:29:58] REVELATION
[2:29:59] AND THE WORD DOES NOT CHANGE
[2:30:03] THE revelation today.
[2:30:07] HALLELUJAH.
[2:30:09] PRAISE THE LORD. WE ARE SICK AND TIRED
[2:30:12] OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY BELIEVE THE
[2:30:14] MESSAGE WHERE THEY BELIEVE PORTIONS OF
[2:30:17] IT.
[2:30:19] PRAY FOR REVELATION
[2:30:21] THAT THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS
[2:30:24] AND THEY NEVER PRAY FOR
[2:30:27] DO THE right thing.
[2:30:32] You may be seated.
[2:30:38] How How did I get here?
[2:30:50] Praise the Lord.
[2:30:53] The Pharisees had a problem
[2:30:56] with Jesus.
[2:30:58] They said, "Thou beareest record of
[2:31:00] thyself,
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; your record cannot be true."
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[2:31:08] "Though I bear record of myself,
[2:31:13] yet my RECORD IS TRUE.
[2:31:16] FOR I know when I come
[2:31:19] and whether I GO,
[2:31:22] but he cannot tell whence I come
[2:31:27] and whether I go. He judge after the
[2:31:31] flesh.
[2:31:33] I judge no man.
[2:31:36] YET IF I JUDGE,
[2:31:38] MY JUDGMENT WOULD BE TRUE.
[2:31:41] FOR I AM NOT ALONE,
[2:31:44] BUT I
[2:31:48] sent me.
[2:31:54] Ah,
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; the Pharisees had a problem.
[2:31:58] He didn't make it any easy for them.
[2:32:01] He's telling them more.
[2:32:04] He says, "I am.
[2:32:06] I am the good shepherd
[2:32:10] and know my sheep
[2:32:13] and am known of mine.
[2:32:16] As the father knoweth me,
[2:32:19] even so know I the father
[2:32:22] and I lay down my sheep
[2:32:26] for the my life for the sheep.
[2:32:30] Verse 19.
[2:32:33] There was a division therefore
[2:32:37] again among the Jews for these sayings.
[2:32:41] Others said, "These are not the words of
[2:32:44] of him.
[2:32:46] The devil,
[2:32:50] can a devil open the eyes of the blind?"
[2:32:54] John chapter 10 verse 33.
[2:32:58] It continues. The Jews answered him,
[2:33:02] saying, "For a good work,
[2:33:05] we stone thee NOT
[2:33:09] for blasphemy,
[2:33:12] and because that thou,
[2:33:15] thou
[2:33:17] being a man
[2:33:20] maketh thyself?"
[2:33:24] Jesus answered them. Is it not written
[2:33:27] in your law? I said ye are gods.
[2:33:32] If he CALLED THEM GOD
[2:33:35] AND TO whom the word of GOD CAME,
[2:33:38] THE scripture cannot be broken.
[2:33:42] Say ye of him
[2:33:44] whom the father had sanctified
[2:33:47] into the world, thou blasphe,
[2:33:53] I am the son of God.
[2:33:56] Jesus saith unto her. This is John
[2:33:58] 11:25.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection
[2:34:04] and the life. HE THAT BELIEVETH IN ME,
[2:34:09] THOUGH HE WERE DEAD,
[2:34:11] YET SHALL he live. Hallelujah.
[2:34:14] Hallelujah. John 14 verse 5. Jesus saith
[2:34:19] unto him,
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; I am the way,
[2:34:23] the truth, and the life. No man cometh
[2:34:27] UNTO THE FATHER
[2:34:29] BUT BY ME.
[2:34:31] If ye had KNOWN ME
[2:34:34] YE SHOULD have known my father,
[2:34:38] AND FROM HENCEFORTH
[2:34:40] YE know him and have seen him.
[2:34:44] Hallelujah.
[2:34:46] How many statements did we read
[2:34:50] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:34:52] plainly
[2:34:55] humbly
[2:34:56] declaring his POSITION
[2:34:59] DECLARING WHO HE WAS RATHER TO SAY I am
[2:35:03] the WAY
[2:35:05] IS TO TELL THE JEWS YOU ARE lost all
[2:35:09] your ways I'm not correct I am the way
[2:35:14] LEAVE YOUR TEMPLE
[2:35:16] LEAVE YOUR ROBES.
[2:35:18] LEAVE YOUR POSITION. I am the way.
[2:35:22] It's like the prophet standing in A FULL
[2:35:25] AUDITORIUM
[2:35:27] LIKE THIS AUDITORIUM. AND STANDING THERE
[2:35:30] AND SAYING, I TAKE EVERY SPIRIT
[2:35:35] UNDER MY CONTROL
[2:35:38] OF GOD. HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. AND AS HE
[2:35:42] WAS CONDUCTING
[2:35:44] PRAYER LIFE AND HIS HUMAN GUARDS,
[2:35:48] you know how he was guarded as a person,
[2:35:50] he was careful.
[2:35:52] So he would ALWAYS TRY TO AVOID
[2:35:55] TO DECLARE HIS POSITION.
[2:35:58] BUT UNDER THE ANOINTING,
[2:36:00] HE WOULD STAND IN THE PRAYER LINE AND
[2:36:03] ASK THE PEOPLE AND SAY, "DO YOU BELIEVE?
[2:36:07] I'M GOD'S PROPHET."
[2:36:11] HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS CLEAR ON WHO HE WAS. AND
[2:36:17] WHEN THE CROSS EYES
[2:36:20] WERE BEING STUBBORN,
[2:36:22] HE WOULD SAY BY THE COMMISSION
[2:36:25] MINISTERED UNTO ME BY AN ANGEL. WHEN I
[2:36:29] WAS IN GREECE,
[2:36:31] I SPEAK UNTO YOU. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HE
[2:36:34] WAS STANDING ON HIS SHORE POSITION,
[2:36:39] SUREOOTED,
[2:36:41] BUT HE WAS A PROPHET OF GOD. AND THE
[2:36:43] ANGEL HAD SAID TO HIM, "NOTHING SHALL
[2:36:46] STAND BEFORE YOU, NOT EVEN CANCER."
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; Do you think the prophet was SURPRISED
[2:37:00] when he was going to pray for King
[2:37:02] George?
[2:37:05] Do you think the prophet was surprised
[2:37:08] when they were coming to him with
[2:37:11] Cadillacs?
[2:37:13] the farmers, the Armenians in California
[2:37:19] who HAD RICH VINEYARDS
[2:37:21] IN California who WERE VERY RELIGIOUS
[2:37:24] PEOPLE that that were fleeing RELIGIOUS
[2:37:27] PERSECUTION
[2:37:29] in Armenia
[2:37:32] that had received a revival
[2:37:34] of the Holy Ghost in Armenia BUT DUE TO
[2:37:38] PERSECUTION
[2:37:40] HAD FLEE TO AMERICA.
[2:37:43] AND GOD PROSPERED THEM. GOD BLESSED
[2:37:46] THEM. AND THEY HAD RICH VINEYARDS.
[2:37:51] AND SHAKARIAN FAMILY
[2:37:54] PEOPLE. ARE WE TOGETHER? And they
[2:37:57] appreciated THE PROPHET
[2:37:59] BECAUSE THEY WERE ACQUAINTED
[2:38:02] WITH THE SUPERNATURAL.
[2:38:04] THEY COME WITH THEM ALL THE WAY FROM
[2:38:09] RIGHT THERE BORDERING TURKEY.
[2:38:12] AND THE USSR
[2:38:16] and they appreciated THE PROPHET'S
[2:38:17] MINISTRY
[2:38:19] AND THEY INVITED HIM INTO
[2:38:22] GRAND HOMES.
[2:38:24] DO YOU THINK THE PROPHET WAS SURPRISED
[2:38:29] WALKING INTO HOMES
[2:38:31] THAT HAD MARBLE FLOORS?
[2:38:33] DO YOU THINK HE WAS SURPRISED WHEN THEY
[2:38:36] WERE BRINGING CADILLACS
[2:38:38] TO HIS HOUSE?
[2:38:40] YOU THINK HE WAS SURPRISED? THE ANGEL OF
[2:38:43] THE LORD
[2:38:45] HAD TOLD HIM, "YOU SHALL PRAY FOR KINGS.
[2:38:49] YOU SHALL BE AMONGST THE RICH.
[2:38:53] THIS GIFT WILL TAKE YOU TO PLACES."
[2:38:57] HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. THAT'S WHY WHEN THEY
[2:39:01] BROUGHT THE CADILLAC,
[2:39:03] HE WOULD SAY, "NO, DON'T WORRY. I don't
[2:39:05] need it.
[2:39:10] If we were to give you a Jeep WRANGLER
[2:39:15] TODAY,
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; you will marry a second wife.
[2:39:30] HE HAD CHARACTER,
[2:39:32] BUT WHERE DID THE CHARACTER COME FROM?
[2:39:36] HE HAD PERFECT REVELATION.
[2:39:39] WHO HE WAS.
[2:39:42] He finally had a Cadillac
[2:39:46] and brother George Smith says this is
[2:39:48] how they ended up giving this Cadillac.
[2:39:53] He said drive to his house,
[2:39:58] PARK THE CAR THERE, MOVE THE KEYS in and
[2:40:02] disappear.
[2:40:10] BECAUSE THEY KNEW HIM THAT HE HIS
[2:40:13] character he would tell them don't worry
[2:40:15] about it.
[2:40:18] HE WAS NOT TAKEN UP
[2:40:23] BY MATERIAL THINGS.
[2:40:25] HE WAS CONSUMED
[2:40:28] BY HIS PURPOSE.
[2:40:32] HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. HIS PROTECTION,
[2:40:38] HIS VICTORY WAS ANCHORED IN HIS PERFECT
[2:40:42] REALIZATION
[2:40:44] OF WHO HE WAS. HALLELUJAH.
[2:40:48] HE COULD NOT GO,
[2:40:50] CHASING AFTER ALL THE WOMEN
[2:40:53] THAT WERE SCREAMING HIS NAME.
[2:40:56] THEY JUST WANTED HIM TO TOUCH THEM
[2:40:59] FOR A BLESSING. HE COULD NOT BE TAKEN UP
[2:41:02] HERE
[2:41:03] BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE WAS GREATER THAN THE
[2:41:07] MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
[2:41:11] HE COULD NOT BE TAKEN UP BY THE MILLIONS
[2:41:14] OF DOLLARS BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE
[2:41:17] GREATER THAN US.
[2:41:19] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE COULD NOT BE
[2:41:21] TAKEN BY THE FULL STADIUMS
[2:41:25] AND POPULARITY
[2:41:27] AND POSTERS WITH HIS FACE AND HIS NAMES.
[2:41:32] HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE WAS
[2:41:35] GREATER THAN US.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; Knowing who you are
[2:41:46] takes OUT PRIDE.
[2:41:49] IF YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE BY REVELATION,
[2:41:54] you know who you are, you don't doubt
[2:41:56] who you are.
[2:41:58] And it takes pride out of you.
[2:42:03] YOU ARE HUMBLE. BUT BEING HUMBLE DOES
[2:42:07] NOT MEAN THAT YOU are not sure.
[2:42:15] I I'm not going to come and stand here
[2:42:18] and pretend like I didn't come to
[2:42:20] preach.
[2:42:24] I don't know, you know,
[2:42:27] the brother, you know, this morning. I
[2:42:31] was having breakfast.
[2:42:34] Somehow the pastor
[2:42:36] felt led.
[2:42:38] I slept with an INTENTION TO PREACH.
[2:42:41] EVER SAY
[2:42:46] I prayed that God help me to PREACH
[2:42:51] AND I FLEW FROM AUSTRALIA
[2:42:54] TO COME AND PREACH
[2:42:57] AND I'M PREACHING BECAUSE I BELIEVE
[2:43:02] GOD HAS GIVEN ME A GIFT
[2:43:04] TO PREACH.
[2:43:07] HALLELUJAH.
[2:43:09] THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT ME.
[2:43:12] IT'S NOT A MISTAKE
[2:43:15] THAT I'M A PASTOR. THAT I'M A PREACHER.
[2:43:19] I WAS BORN FOR THAT PURPOSE.
[2:43:22] I WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT PURPOSE.
[2:43:26] I CAN PREACH
[2:43:28] BECAUSE GOD
[2:43:30] HAS CALLED ME FOR THAT PURPOSE. I'M NOT
[2:43:33] POSTING.
[2:43:35] I'M DECLARING MY PURPOSE.
[2:43:39] HALLELUJAH.
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of beautiful sisters
[2:43:46] here.
[2:43:49] Oh, Uganda is a very
[2:43:52] pretty women.
[2:43:54] Some serious black beauties.
[2:43:58] Of course, my wife is the BEST
[2:44:04] in
[2:44:05] case she's watching.
[2:44:14] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; DON'T THINK I'M NOT SEEING YOU.
[2:44:18] MY NATURAL EYES, THEY ARE SEEING YOU.
[2:44:22] THEY SAY THAT SISTER IS
[2:44:24] THAT SISTER IS ME. BUT MY PURPOSE
[2:44:29] HAS NO FURTHER CONNECTION TO YOU.
[2:44:33] MY HANDSHAKE.
[2:44:35] HALLELUJAH.
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SAY, "GOD BLESS YOU, SISTER."
[2:44:38] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; MY PURPOSE IS GREATER THAN YOUR
[2:44:44] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. MY PROTECTION IS IN MY
[2:44:47] PURPOSE.
[2:44:50] HALLELUJAH.
[2:44:56] PRAISE THE LORD.
[2:44:57] I'M NOT SCOUTING AROUND THE CAMP
[2:45:00] TO SEE HOW I can sneak out AT NIGHT
[2:45:04] TO GO AND SEE THE SISTERS.
[2:45:07] I'M LOCKING MY DOOR
[2:45:10] ADVENTURE.
[2:45:12] THE devil will inspire a sister.
[2:45:25] I'M LOCKING MY DOOR.
[2:45:28] WHEN I TRAVEL TO PREACH, I ASK IF
[2:45:31] THERE'S a lock.
[2:45:34] I DON'T WANT THE DEVIL TO INSPIRE A
[2:45:38] SISTER
[2:45:39] TO SNEAK INTO MY ROOM.
[2:45:43] YOU will find the DOOR LOCKED
[2:45:46] BECAUSE I traveled FOR ONE PURPOSE.
[2:45:49] PREACH THE GOSPEL
[2:45:51] OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:45:54] HALLELUJAH.
[2:45:56] MY PROTECTION
[2:45:58] IS IN MY PURPOSE.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; ONE WIFE, ONE WOMAN, ONE FAMILY BECAUSE
[2:46:06] I'M A MINISTER OF GOSPEL OF JESUS
[2:46:09] CHRIST.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; It's time we close.
[2:46:25] time will close.
[2:46:27] Your purpose,
[2:46:29] THE REVELATION OF IT
[2:46:31] is your protection.
[2:46:34] THE REVELATION OF IT
[2:46:37] IS YOUR BLESSING.
[2:46:39] THE REVELATION OF IT is your rapturing
[2:46:42] faith. THE REVELATION OF IT WILL MAKE
[2:46:46] YOU STAND IN THE DEN OF LIONS.
[2:46:50] THE REVELATION OF IT WE WILL MAKE YOU
[2:46:52] STAND IN THE FIERY FURNACE. THE
[2:46:56] REVELATION OF IT. WE WILL LOOK AT A
[2:46:58] PIECE OF LAND.
[2:47:00] EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T have any MONEY IN
[2:47:02] YOUR LIFE, THE REVELATION OF YOUR
[2:47:04] PURPOSE, WE SAY, "BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
[2:47:08] we now NEED OUR OWN CHURCH." AND THAT
[2:47:11] PIECE OF LAND THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THE
[2:47:13] MONEY, BUT WE'VE GOT TO BELIEVE GOD THAT
[2:47:17] HE WILL PROVIDE TO US. IT IS A
[2:47:20] REALIZATION
[2:47:21] THAT I'M A PASTOR TO THESE PEOPLE AND
[2:47:24] YOUR FATHER SHOULD PROVIDE A HOME FOR
[2:47:27] YOU. IT IS YOUR PURPOSE THAT WILL MAKE A
[2:47:31] WAY FOR YOU. GOD WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH
[2:47:34] THE HOME THAT YOU NEED BECAUSE YOU ARE
[2:47:37] IN YOUR PURPOSE. YOUR PURPOSE
[2:47:42] IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN
[2:47:44] THE CAR. YOUR PURPOSE AS AUNTIE
[2:47:50] AS A MOTHER WILL STOP A PLANE BECAUSE A
[2:47:54] MOTHER IS HER POSITION
[2:47:58] PERFECT REALIZATION
[2:48:01] POSITION.
[2:48:10] HALLELUJAH.
[2:48:12] GLORY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. I KNOW WHO I
[2:48:16] AM. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHERE IS ELIJAH
[2:48:20] AND GOD
[2:48:22] HONORS THAT FAVOR? AND THE PLANE TO SEND
[2:48:28] ELIJAH TO THE MIGHTY.
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:48:41] Hallelujah.
[2:48:44] Oh my
[2:48:45] &gt;&gt; time fail us.
[2:48:57] Help
[2:49:00] us. Oneness.
[2:49:03] We are in the end.
[2:49:06] Oneness.
[2:49:08] Are you so one with God?
[2:49:14] That's the way you are going to have to
[2:49:18] be.
[2:49:21] Yeah. We are going to have to BE ONE
[2:49:24] WITH HIM.
[2:49:27] TILL let the MIND
[2:49:30] THAT was in Christ
[2:49:33] be in you.
[2:49:35] Then Christ
[2:49:37] his own mind
[2:49:40] in you WILL RECOGNIZE
[2:49:44] every word
[2:49:46] that HE WROTE.
[2:49:49] it did IN THE APOSTLES
[2:49:51] rightly dividing the SCRIPTURE
[2:49:56] which is the truth the Holy Spirit. If
[2:50:00] it is the truth
[2:50:02] then he will bear RECORD OF IT
[2:50:06] BY BRINGING the same sign that he GAVE
[2:50:08] US
[2:50:10] same sign he give to Abraham
[2:50:13] same sign he did by Christ
[2:50:16] same sign he did by fa
[2:50:19] We are in the end time.
[2:50:22] He said that WOULD BE
[2:50:24] IN THE END TIME.
[2:50:26] THE CHURCH COLLECTIVELY
[2:50:29] IS GETTING TOGETHER IN A UNION. ONE here
[2:50:35] and one there making it up.
[2:50:41] The spoken word is the original seed.
[2:50:44] Verse two. Believers of the word.
[2:50:48] and the spirit must be one. You get it?
[2:50:53] The congregation says
[2:50:56] believers
[2:50:57] the word and the spirit are absolutely
[2:51:02] one.
[2:51:03] YOU DON'T DO YOUR OWN THINKING.
[2:51:07] YOU DON'T USE YOUR OWN MIND.
[2:51:10] ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL? The mind that was
[2:51:13] IN CHRIST
[2:51:15] IS IN YOU.
[2:51:17] SEE THE MIND IS IN CHRIST
[2:51:20] AND YOU TAKE THE WORD
[2:51:23] JUST LIKE HE DID
[2:51:25] BECAUSE HE WAS the word AND THE MIND OF
[2:51:29] CHRIST IN YOU. You are the word.
[2:51:34] YOU ARE GOD'S
[2:51:37] LIVING WORD
[2:51:41] REPRESENTATIVES OF HIM
[2:51:44] HERE ON EARTH. That's right. CONTINUING
[2:51:48] THE WORK. THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THAT WAY.
[2:51:52] AND WHEN so the Bible is manifested
[2:51:56] AGAIN
[2:52:00] like in the early days of the disciples.
[2:52:05] Just like the disciple,
[2:52:08] the Bible is living again.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[2:52:16] When you receive the Holy Ghost,
[2:52:20] you are born into the kingdom.
[2:52:24] You are a baby right there.
[2:52:30] He says the Pentecostals
[2:52:33] made that mistake.
[2:52:36] Don't sleep. I'm closing.
[2:52:40] He says the Pentecostals
[2:52:43] made that mistake.
[2:52:45] They thought now that they've received
[2:52:46] the Bible,
[2:52:49] they have all of it.
[2:52:51] But he says that was just the beginning.
[2:52:54] Says when you receive the baptism,
[2:52:58] you are a newborn baby.
[2:53:01] A newborn baby
[2:53:03] HAS TO GROW.
[2:53:05] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:53:07] You talk to many young people
[2:53:11] in the message, they don't know if they
[2:53:15] have the Holy Ghost
[2:53:17] or not. And many times the fold
[2:53:22] is ours
[2:53:25] ministers because WE CAN PREACH IT in
[2:53:28] such a way that you will start
[2:53:33] but when you COME TO THE WORLD when your
[2:53:36] hands are laid on you when you have the
[2:53:38] experience that's all of it all your
[2:53:41] weaknesses are going to all your
[2:53:44] immaturities going all this is going to
[2:53:46] falls
[2:53:48] ship is going to go. Your lust is going
[2:53:51] to go. You won't even like sisters. If
[2:53:54] you are a sister, you won't even like
[2:53:56] brothers.
[2:54:00] And then after the convention
[2:54:03] and you see a brother
[2:54:05] that is really dressed up,
[2:54:08] nice fresh haircut,
[2:54:11] LOOKING STRONG AND TALL
[2:54:14] AND YOU feel a certain way and all the
[2:54:17] jumping at camp.
[2:54:20] The amens at camp, THEY ARE DEAD RIGHT
[2:54:23] THERE.
[2:54:24] WHY DID I FEEL like this?
[2:54:27] So I didn't RECEIVE THE BAPTISM.
[2:54:31] GOD DIDN'T TOUCH ME with that
[2:54:33] convention. The problem is you have a
[2:54:37] wrong CONCEPT
[2:54:40] OF THE BAPTISM
[2:54:42] OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:54:44] The baptism of the HOLY GHOST IS A
[2:54:47] BIRTH. YOU ARE BORN A BABY. AND THE HOLY
[2:54:52] GHOST WILL GUIDE YOU. THE HOLY GHOST
[2:54:56] WILL HOLD YOUR HAND AND SAY, "LET'S GO.
[2:55:00] AVOID THAT THING BECAUSE IT WILL HURT
[2:55:02] YOU. COME THIS WAY." THE HOLY GHOST WHEN
[2:55:07] YOU ARE STUBBORN, YOU SAY, "OKAY, SINCE
[2:55:11] YOU INSIST, GO AHEAD AND DO IT. AND WHEN
[2:55:15] YOU COME BLEEDING,
[2:55:17] THE HOLY GHOST SAYS, you have learned
[2:55:19] your lesson. Let's keep going.
[2:55:23] IT'S THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:55:25] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HE IS A GUIDE,
[2:55:28] GUIDE YOU. THE HOLY GHOST IS GOING TO
[2:55:32] LEAD YOU. THE BIBLE SAYS ISRAEL WAS LED
[2:55:38] BY THE PILLAR OF FIRE. WHERE DID THE
[2:55:41] PILLAR OF FIRE? LEAD THEM TO THE RED
[2:55:45] SEA. THE RED SEA BEFORE THEM
[2:55:48] ON EITHER SIDE
[2:55:50] BEHIND THEM LED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:56:05] YOU THINK THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[2:56:08] WAS surprised
[2:56:11] that there was the Red Sea?
[2:56:14] He was like, "Oh,
[2:56:20] HE DID IT ON PURPOSE.
[2:56:25] HALLELUJAH.
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; FOR THE EXPERIENCE.
[2:56:28] FOR THE EXPERIENCE.
[2:56:31] HE DID IT ON PURPOSE.
[2:56:33] THIS DAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RED
[2:56:36] SEA. IT WAS A PILLAR OF FIRE. LET GOD'S
[2:56:41] PEOPLE
[2:56:43] SEE. GOD WILL LEAD YOU IN DIFFICULT
[2:56:48] TIMES. GOD WILL ALLOW YOU TO ENTER INTO
[2:56:52] TEMPTATION
[2:56:54] BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:56:56] BUT WHAT IS HE DOING? HE IS BUILDING YOU
[2:56:59] UP EXPERIENCE BY EXPERIENCE
[2:57:03] FROM GLORY TO GLORY.
[2:57:05] HE IS ESTABLISHING YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU
[2:57:10] ARE A SON OF GOD. YOU ARE A DAUGHTER OF
[2:57:12] GOD. YOU CAME FROM GOD. YOU GO BACK TO
[2:57:16] GOD. THE SAME GOD WHO DELIVERED ME FROM
[2:57:21] A LION. THE SAME GOD WHO DELIVERED ME
[2:57:25] FROM A BEAR IS THE SAME GOD THAT WILL
[2:57:29] DELIVER ME FROM THIS COLL.
[2:57:34] GLORY. THANK YOU JESUS. BY THE HOLY
[2:57:38] GHOST GOD ALLOWED IT
[2:57:43] TO BLINDLY
[2:57:45] WALK INTO A TRAP.
[2:57:47] AND THERE WAS ARMIES, WELL ARMED ARMIES
[2:57:51] THAT HAD SET A TRAP FOR HIM. AND GOD
[2:57:55] ALLOWED HIM TO WALK INTO THAT TRAP
[2:57:58] BECAUSE HE HAD A PURPOSE TO SHOW THAT HE
[2:58:01] WAS NOT IN THE STRENGTH OF SAMSON.
[2:58:04] IT WAS IN HIS SPIRIT
[2:58:06] AND HE HAD NO WEAPONS
[2:58:11] AND DID NOT ALLOW SAMSON TO CARRY A
[2:58:14] WEAPON.
[2:58:16] DAY AND HE LOOKED AROUND
[2:58:20] AND HE FOUND A JOB
[2:58:22] OF A DONKEY AND BY THE DONKEY.
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:58:28] &gt;&gt; HE FOUGHT AN ARMY AND DESTROYED THEM
[2:58:32] BY THE HOLY GHOST,
[2:58:34] GOD WAS BUILDING A CHARACTER UNTIL HE
[2:58:38] GOT ONE DAY TO A PLACE WHERE EVEN THOUGH
[2:58:42] HE WAS BACKSLIDING,
[2:58:44] HE KNEW HIS GOD.
[2:58:46] SAY THE LORD ONCE MORE. YOU'VE DONE THIS
[2:58:49] WITH ME BEFORE. YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
[2:58:53] YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN. MY HAIR HAS GROWN
[2:58:56] BACK. YOU ARE STILL THE SAME GOD ONCE
[2:58:59] MORE. LET ME DIE WITHIN.
[2:59:04] THE SAME GOD THAT HAD BEEN WITH HIM
[2:59:07] STOOD WITH HIM AND HE DESTROYED
[2:59:11] PHILIST
[2:59:14] all the other
[2:59:20] young people
[2:59:23] allow God
[2:59:25] to guide you.
[2:59:27] ALLOW GOD
[2:59:29] TO HOLD YOUR HAND.
[2:59:32] ALLOW GOD
[2:59:34] TO SEND YOU TO THE RURAL AREAS
[2:59:37] TO TESTIFY THE GOSPEL.
[2:59:40] DON'T BE IN A RUSH TO HAVE A CHURCH IN
[2:59:43] CAMPA.
[2:59:45] DON'T BE IN A RUSH TO HAVE A church in
[2:59:49] Nairobi. DON'T BE IN A RUSH TO DRIVE A
[2:59:53] NICE car and have a house like THE
[2:59:56] PASTOR
[2:59:57] DRESS LIKE that other
[2:59:59] YOUNG SISTER. Don't have all these SILLY
[3:00:02] MINDS
[3:00:04] WHERE YOU are looking FOR A RICH BROTHER
[3:00:07] BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO BELIEVE THAT
[3:00:11] GOD CAN SEND A BROTHER WITH NOTHING AND
[3:00:16] YOU BEING A FAITH WOMAN. YOU WILL PRAY
[3:00:20] FOR GOD BLESS YOUR HUSBAND AND PROSPER
[3:00:24] HIM
[3:00:27] brother at church.
[3:00:31] Hallelujah.
[3:00:34] HALLELUJAH.
[3:00:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:00:36] &gt;&gt; OH BROTHER, God wants to mold character.
[3:00:41] God wants you to KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
[3:00:44] THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL KNOW WHAT GOD HAS
[3:00:48] PUT IN YOU IS WHEN HE PUTS YOU THROUGH
[3:00:51] EXPERIENCE
[3:00:53] THAT WILL REVEAL WHAT IS ON THE INSIDE.
[3:00:57] COMING TO THAT PLACE OF PERFECT
[3:01:00] REALIZATION.
[3:01:01] NOW AS I close the TITLE OF MY SERMON
[3:01:06] was and is tutored to perfect
[3:01:10] realization.
[3:01:17] by to perfect realization.
[3:01:23] Praise the Lord. John chapter 16,
[3:01:27] I have yet many things to say unto you,
[3:01:32] but he cannot bear you.
[3:01:35] How be it, when the Spirit of truth is
[3:01:38] come,
[3:01:40] he will guide you.
[3:01:43] into all truth.
[3:01:45] For he shall NOT SPEAK OF HIMSELF,
[3:01:48] BUT WHATSOEVER HE SHALL HEAR,
[3:01:51] THAT SHALL he speak,
[3:01:54] and he WILL SHOW YOU
[3:01:56] THINGS TO COME.
[3:01:59] He has given us a guide.
[3:02:02] Let the guide come in your life.
[3:02:05] Lose your car minds and
[3:02:09] accept the mind of Christ.
[3:02:11] by the Holy Ghost. Let him reveal to you
[3:02:16] WHO HE IS. Because as he reveals to you
[3:02:20] WHO HE IS, HE REVEALS to you who you
[3:02:24] are.
[3:02:26] SOMETIMES TAKES TIME, HE'S GOING TO PUT
[3:02:28] YOU IN SITUATION
[3:02:30] FOR YOU to dig deeper and realize what
[3:02:33] you've got. He's going to TEST YOUR
[3:02:36] PATIENCE.
[3:02:38] THE BIBLE SAYS HE MAY TURN the whole
[3:02:40] church against you,
[3:02:43] but it is God working ON YOUR CHARACTER.
[3:02:47] OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. We are the
[3:02:49] GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS.
[3:02:51] WE DO THINGS WITH REVELATION.
[3:02:54] WE ARE NOT TOO EXCITED,
[3:02:57] TOO IMPATIENT,
[3:02:59] BUT WE ARE PATIENT WITH GOD.
[3:03:02] REVELATION
[3:03:04] SONS AND DAUGHTERS.
[3:03:07] WE CANNOT LOSE.
[3:03:09] NEITHER CAN WE BE LOST BECAUSE GOD IS
[3:03:13] AND WE ARE NOT PROUD
[3:03:16] BEFORE OUR GOD.
[3:03:18] OUR GOD SHALL FIGHT FOR US. MAY THE LORD
[3:03:22] BLESS YOU. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[3:03:25] &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T MEET THIS SIDE,
[3:03:28] we'll meet ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[3:03:30] GOD BLESS YOU.
[3:03:35] HALLELUJAH.
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[3:03:45] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[3:03:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you seen this word. Let
[3:03:49] your word be born in the m of my heart.
[3:03:53] If the song leader can sing that song.
[3:03:59] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[3:04:04] &gt;&gt; One of my longest sermons in recent
[3:04:07] history.
[3:04:13] Amen.
[3:04:15] But God is good.
[3:04:19] Let your word
[3:04:22] be born
[3:04:26] of my life.
[3:04:30] and let it live in me.
[3:04:34] Let it shine.
[3:04:39] Start inside this house of clay.
[3:04:45] Mold me every day.
[3:04:49] Oh, let word be
[3:04:54] in the m
[3:05:00] Let your word
[3:05:04] word
[3:05:09] in the manger of my heart
[3:05:14] and let it live in me.
[3:05:19] Let it shine.
[3:05:24] Start inside this house of clay
[3:05:29] and mold me every day.
[3:05:34] And let your words be warm
[3:05:38] in the manger
[3:05:42] of my
[3:05:44] Oh, may the brother come and help us
[3:05:47] sing this song. He made a way. You made
[3:05:49] a way. The one that we sing
[3:05:54] Amen. So that we can just worship
[3:05:55] together.
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:05:59] &gt;&gt; And then when he does, God bless you.
[3:06:11] made our way.
[3:06:18] You
[3:06:20] made our way.
[3:06:27] When I bounce against the wall
[3:06:32] and it looked as if it was all gone, you
[3:06:40] made our way
[3:06:46] and we standing
[3:06:48] here
[3:06:51] only because
[3:06:53] you Away.
[3:06:57] You made a way.
[3:07:01] You
[3:07:03] You made
[3:07:08] You You made a way.
[3:07:11] You
[3:07:17] &gt;&gt; when I pass
[3:07:23] the wall
[3:07:25] and you learn to see it was
[3:07:31] You
[3:07:33] made our way
[3:07:42] here.
[3:07:45] Behold
[3:07:47] you.
[3:07:52] Listen,
[3:07:55] we're going to sing this a few more
[3:07:56] times, but I want you to close your eyes
[3:07:57] and
[3:08:01] Think about everything that has been
[3:08:06] quite some serious things were said.
[3:08:10] And I kind of felt in my heart
[3:08:13] that indeed that must be God,
[3:08:17] collecting a bunch of young people
[3:08:20] and telling us serious serious things
[3:08:25] concerning our life.
[3:08:27] He has indeed made a way
[3:08:30] to move mountain
[3:08:33] to cause walls to fall over.
[3:08:37] But we can give him a moment
[3:08:39] and let him do it right.
[3:08:43] Would you just surrender your heart now?
[3:08:46] We are in his presence. I always want to
[3:08:49] feel that there's no rush.
[3:08:52] When you are in his presence, it's no
[3:08:54] longer time is no longer an issue.
[3:09:00] Just meditate as you sing
[3:09:03] about all the things that you
[3:09:07] let us sing.
[3:09:10] Brother Shalom.
[3:09:12] You
[3:09:15] made our way.
[3:09:20] Hallelujah.
[3:09:22] You
[3:09:24] made our way
[3:09:31] with a box against the wall
[3:09:36] and it looked as if it was over.
[3:09:42] You
[3:09:44] made
[3:09:46] our way.
[3:09:49] Hallelujah.
[3:09:51] And we're standing
[3:09:53] here
[3:09:55] only because
[3:09:58] you
[3:10:05] move mountains
[3:10:09] now
[3:10:12] to fall
[3:10:14] with your power
[3:10:20] for Miracles.
[3:10:24] There is nothing
[3:10:27] nothing.
[3:10:46] You move mountain.
[3:10:51] You go
[3:10:56] with your power.
[3:11:00] You are performing miracles right now in
[3:11:02] my life. Oh yes. That's why you sent
[3:11:06] your word to me. There was nothing
[3:11:10] nothing
[3:11:24] you
[3:11:28] tell him
[3:11:30] the way you
[3:11:39] away.
[3:11:49] Hallelujah.
[3:12:00] You
[3:12:03] made my way
[3:12:14] only because
[3:12:16] you made
[3:12:19] the way.
[3:12:21] Maybe you want him to move some
[3:12:22] mountains for you.
[3:12:25] But we have heard today
[3:12:29] when the man of God was preaching,
[3:12:32] this is a generation
[3:12:35] that wants things fast,
[3:12:38] a microwave generation,
[3:12:41] but you know, you see that you moved
[3:12:43] mountains
[3:12:46] because you sing it by faith.
[3:12:49] You already see him moving mountains.
[3:12:54] things are going to happen according to
[3:12:55] his will, according to his word.
[3:12:59] But the fact that you have heard what
[3:13:00] you have heard today,
[3:13:02] he's already moving those mountain.
[3:13:06] What is hard?
[3:13:08] What is hard? What is your mountain
[3:13:11] today?
[3:13:13] What is your mountain today?
[3:13:16] He is here to move that
[3:13:18] &gt;&gt; with his power. He is a miracle worker.
[3:13:23] He makes a way where there is no way
[3:13:26] and he's here to make a way right now.
[3:13:29] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we can just give it a few
[3:13:30] more moments
[3:13:33] in prayer and worship.
[3:13:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:13:40] Mountains
[3:13:43] you cause.
[3:13:46] &gt;&gt; Sing it to him if you can now. your
[3:13:49] power.
[3:13:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Miracle miracle.
[3:13:56] &gt;&gt; There is nothing there is nothing
[3:14:00] &gt;&gt; nothing possible with you.
[3:14:03] mercy
[3:14:08] and we stand
[3:14:12] before
[3:14:14] you
[3:14:17] away.
[3:14:19] You made a way.
[3:14:22] You
[3:14:24] made a way.
[3:14:29] You made a way.
[3:14:35] You away.
[3:14:43] Hallelujah.
[3:14:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:14:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:15:00] Now we stand
[3:15:03] before.
[3:15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:15:20] Everybody in prayer now
[3:15:24] we have heard today
[3:15:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:15:32] is a start
[3:15:35] and when he comes into YOUR HEART
[3:15:39] HE never leaves.
[3:15:43] But you see, you still have to come to
[3:15:44] MATURITY
[3:15:47] and you will go through things.
[3:15:51] You'll go through struggle.
[3:15:54] But you want to know WHO YOU ARE
[3:15:58] BEFORE YOU face life's challenge.
[3:16:02] You need to know what you have received.
[3:16:05] You need to know that is in your heart.
[3:16:09] You need to come to that realization.
[3:16:14] HALLELUJAH.

[3:16:21] &gt;&gt; While everybody's praying,
[3:16:24] &gt;&gt; if I can have more sound, a little more
[3:16:25] sound.
[3:16:28] While everybody's praying,
[3:16:31] if you are here
[3:16:34] and your back is against the wall,
[3:16:38] your back is against the wall
[3:16:42] and you don't know what you've got,
[3:16:46] BUT YOU NEED SOMETHING
[3:16:48] TO BE ABLE TO go through the challenge.
[3:16:54] Your place IS AT THE ALTAR.
[3:16:57] LET ME TELL YOU, WE serve a real living
[3:16:59] God.

[3:17:09] &gt;&gt; Your back is against the wall.
[3:17:14] This is your moment.
[3:17:16] This is your time.
[3:17:19] DON'T LET IT PASS YOU. FEEL free to come
[3:17:23] at the EARLY
[3:17:26] making that trip TO COME OVER HERE
[3:17:29] SAY LORD
[3:17:31] I want to come TO THAT REALIZATION
[3:17:34] OF WHO I AM
[3:17:36] SO THAT I CAN FACE LIFE'S CHALLENGE
[3:17:41] with boldness
[3:17:44] with CONFIDENCE
[3:17:46] BECAUSE I KNOW ONE THING
[3:17:49] I AM A CHILD OF GOD.
[3:17:52] I AM BORN AGAIN
[3:17:55] WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[3:17:58] I KNOW WHO I AM.

[3:18:06] where you GET THAT EXPERIENCE.

[3:18:11] ATMOSPHERE WHERE YOU GET THAT
[3:18:13] EXPERIENCE.
[3:18:14] DON'T LET IT PASS YOU BY.
[3:18:19] IS more than an emotion.
[3:18:23] When your heart is ACCUMULATED
[3:18:29] by the revelation of what you HAVE
[3:18:31] HEARD,
[3:18:33] something pulling ON THE INSIDE
[3:18:36] SAY, "OH GOD, I WANT TO HAVE what the

[3:27:48] your anointing.

[3:32:29] when the conversion is over, let us not
[3:32:32] forget this. May this be a memorial
[3:32:35] shall move with us with every day
[3:32:39] everywhere that we shall go. Let us go
[3:32:41] with his presence and let it always do a
[3:32:44] change. shall continue growing

[3:33:14] Grant it, Lord.
[3:33:16] as we praise thy name
[3:33:19] &gt;&gt; and in your name Jesus Christ.
[3:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Have
[3:33:32] your seat.
[3:33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33:37] Let us give the Lord a clap of praise
[3:33:38] for the word we have.
[3:33:46] There's a lot of things that has been
[3:33:47] said this morning.
[3:33:51] But you see, I just want to rehearse one
[3:33:53] or two things and then we dismiss
[3:33:57] so that we can go to lunch. When you
[3:33:59] know who you are,
[3:34:02] you remain humble.
[3:34:04] You stop pretending.
[3:34:10] You You just You are who you are.
[3:34:13] You know who you are. You don't need to
[3:34:15] pretend about it. See what it is. What
[3:34:18] is it? It's confidence without ego.
[3:34:24] Jesus knew who he was.
[3:34:27] He never allowed the the the Pharisees
[3:34:30] to talk HIM OUT OF IT.
[3:34:34] NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAID, HE SAID, "If
[3:34:38] you don't believe that I am he,
[3:34:40] you will die in your sin."
[3:34:43] Yet the Bible says, "Let this man that
[3:34:45] was in Christ,
[3:34:48] he was in THE FORM OF GOD,
[3:34:50] BUT HE NEVER MADE HIMSELF EQUAL WITH
[3:34:52] GOD."
[3:34:54] SO HE being God, yet he humbled himself
[3:34:58] into a form of a son.
[3:35:00] So when you realize when you come to the
[3:35:02] PERFECT REALIZATION
[3:35:04] of your identity in CHRIST
[3:35:09] then you realize you are the
[3:35:11] righteousness.
[3:35:15] You
[3:35:17] the righteousness
[3:35:19] of God.
[3:35:21] How does it sound?
[3:35:24] It sounds unbelievable.
[3:35:27] But that's the realization you have to
[3:35:29] come to.
[3:35:32] When you come to that,
[3:35:35] not even the devil can defeat you.
[3:35:40] Do you know brother Bham said that if
[3:35:42] the the true church will know who she is
[3:35:47] &gt;&gt; and what she stand
[3:35:51] your purpose
[3:35:56] the devil he she the church will be an
[3:36:00] invisible church
[3:36:04] even if all hell we sing a song ALL HELL
[3:36:07] ARE
[3:36:10] THEY CANNOT DEFEAT me
[3:36:13] to an extent. You go THROUGH STUFF,
[3:36:16] you are not going to doubt your
[3:36:17] experience.
[3:36:20] For those of you who have the experience
[3:36:21] of the baptism of
[3:36:23] you, you are not going to doubt it
[3:36:25] because you see we have heard that
[3:36:28] that's a part of the package.
[3:36:30] The troubles and the trials AND THE TEST
[3:36:34] QUESTION YOUR EXPERIENCE.
[3:36:40] BECAUSE WHEN HE COMES IN, HE NEVER
[3:36:43] LEAVES.
[3:36:45] HE COMES TO STAY.
[3:36:47] HE ABIDES.
[3:36:50] But the troubles KEEP COMING.
[3:36:54] KEEP COMING. WHY DO THEY COME? BECAUSE
[3:36:57] HE IS IN THERE.
[3:37:00] HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
[3:37:03] STEPPED INTO THE PROMISED LAND, TROUBLE
[3:37:05] STARTED. THEY ACTUALLY STARTED WITH
[3:37:07] JERO.
[3:37:09] WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAD TO CLAIM EVERY
[3:37:12] INCH of ground.
[3:37:16] IT WAS PROMISED TO THEM. SO WHEN YOU
[3:37:19] RECEIVE THE BAPT Holy Ghost, THEN THE
[3:37:21] BATTLE STARTS.
[3:37:23] THEN YOU ARE RECRUITED AS A SOLDIER
[3:37:26] IN THE ARMY OF THE LORD. AND THIS BAND
[3:37:29] OF SOLDIERS
[3:37:31] ARE INVISIBLE.
[3:37:33] THEY CANNOT BE DEFEATED.
[3:37:36] I AM ONE OF YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[3:37:38] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THINGS COME MY WAY, I am not
[3:37:42] going to say wait. Am I really baptized
[3:37:45] with the Holy Ghost?
[3:37:47] People think when the Holy Ghost comes,
[3:37:50] he will come and take away the demons.
[3:37:55] He will not.
[3:37:57] He will guide you. He will lead you.
[3:38:01] That's the purpose.
[3:38:03] And I'm so thankful that we have
[3:38:05] received a messenger in our day
[3:38:09] that has brought these these things to
[3:38:10] us
[3:38:12] and men of God that can come and break
[3:38:15] the word
[3:38:18] to the extent that everyone can
[3:38:19] understand.
[3:38:21] Let us give a clap to our brother.
[3:38:26] Amen.
[3:38:27] The baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:38:30] IS THE START.
[3:38:32] You have to come to maturity.
[3:38:35] You have to gain character by the things
[3:38:38] WHICH YOU SUFFER. YOU HAVE TO feed on
[3:38:40] the word.
[3:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. H there's a lot of things I
[3:38:44] would want to say but I have to dismiss
[3:38:46] you for lunch.
[3:38:49] But I feel
[3:38:52] I have been so much blessed
[3:38:55] by Pastor Michael's ministry.
[3:38:59] Amen.
[3:39:00] Now, now that you are here,
[3:39:04] how about having him again?
[3:39:15] Let's Let's Let's have him again.
[3:39:19] You are going nowhere.
[3:39:23] It's a 100% vote.
[3:39:27] We We inviting you again.
[3:39:30] That's wonderful.
[3:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39:34] &gt;&gt; When you go back to path,
[3:39:37] &gt;&gt; send greetings to the saints.
[3:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39:42] &gt;&gt; I want to salute uh uh my friend uh who
[3:39:45] has just arrived.
[3:39:49] God bless you so much.
[3:39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now I I will just do
[3:39:56] the thing of the districts in the next
[3:39:58] service because
[3:40:02] I just received a note from the deacons
[3:40:05] and we have another crowd that has
[3:40:07] joined us
[3:40:10] that have not necessarily registered
[3:40:13] which means we never prepared
[3:40:17] things food for them. So we want to be
[3:40:20] to be able to know who is who is camping
[3:40:26] the ones that were prepared. So you need
[3:40:28] to put on your tag.
[3:40:36] Yeah. If you don't have it and you go to
[3:40:39] the line, maybe
[3:40:48] we don't want that to happen.
[3:40:51] Amen. If you have a tag,
[3:40:55] it means you either paid camp fee
[3:41:00] or someone helped you to pick up
[3:41:03] and so it's it's good you have it with
[3:41:05] you.
[3:41:07] Brother Shalom, come. We're just going
[3:41:09] to come back at 2 p.m.
[3:41:12] Uh we already we've already moved our
[3:41:15] time a little bit. So let's try to be
[3:41:18] here. I know not probably others would
[3:41:20] still be eating but let's be start
[3:41:24] here.
[3:41:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. So he's I think the one is he the
[3:41:28] one taking the service. Okay. Just make
[3:41:30] make sure that he starts the service
[3:41:32] exactly.
[3:41:35] God bless you.
[3:41:44] Just a close walk with him.
[3:41:50] Granted, Jesus is my plea.
[3:41:57] Daily
[3:41:59] walking close to thee.
[3:42:03] Let it be the Lord. Let it be.
[3:42:10] I am weak but thou are strong.
