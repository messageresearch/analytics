[15:39] today I thank God for yesterday those
[15:42] who came around to celebrate with us
[15:44] were really blessed to have you and my
[15:47] testimony is that
[15:50] uh throughout my level I really found a
[15:54] hard time in school like academic part
[15:59] I did pay because it felt heavy for me
[16:04] and I really tried my best
[16:06] I the best points I got were in first
[16:10] ter form five after
[16:13] that I didn't I don't think I crossed
[16:15] Five
[16:16] Points till I I finished my a level
[16:20] those were my best points I used to get
[16:22] 3 three3 and at the end of the
[16:26] year promotional exams
[16:29] I got five points and I was below the
[16:32] promotion line so they asked me to
[16:35] repeat form five so I felt
[16:40] bad and I came I shared with some people
[16:43] talk to many people around who advise me
[16:46] they told me no don't
[16:48] waste
[16:49] so I decided to to to go back to school
[16:54] to go for they they had an option of
[16:56] promoting me but they make me sit under
[16:59] another Center and that Center we were
[17:02] sitting with
[17:03] prisoners were sitting with old
[17:06] people was sitting with people who who
[17:09] had failed
[17:10] like very old people very old men people
[17:13] who are coming back for for Education
[17:16] just maybe to get a course so it was so
[17:21] humiliating but I decided to take it
[17:24] like that so I I went I started school
[17:28] and we used to form groups people who
[17:30] are in that Center encourage each other
[17:33] be
[17:35] like uh in the world they don't care
[17:38] where School you are in as long as you
[17:40] have your point those things don't
[17:42] matter so I went to school with that
[17:45] mind so I accepted that I'm going to sit
[17:49] with them so in it was it was actually
[17:53] after physics practical and then the
[17:55] deputy steps in and he's like he reads
[17:58] our name and he says you have a problem
[18:00] with your you name stuff so come to my
[18:03] office so when he went to his office he
[18:06] told us you people you're very lucky he
[18:10] told us that they sat as a group and
[18:12] discussed about our results this was now
[18:14] in form six and then they decided to
[18:17] take us back to the school
[18:20] c i i i told my friends that it's
[18:23] because of me that you've been
[18:26] transferred yeah so I thank God for that
[18:28] that and then when results came out
[18:31] recently I thank God very much I I beat
[18:35] almost very many people who are in the
[18:36] school Center 5 and I got 15
[18:43] points
[18:45] and I I can I can get almost any course

[1:32:00] speak on a
[1:32:02] subject um I am but a
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:11] man okay tell your neighbor I am but a
[1:32:16] man and maybe for an inspiration a man
[1:32:19] under Divine assignment
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:28] I
[1:32:30] believe I am but a
[1:32:32] man but I am a man under Divine
[1:32:38] assignment and I am convinced that this
[1:32:40] morning I'm speaking to many like
[1:32:46] me so if you are like
[1:32:48] me a man not an angel a man
[1:32:54] then um this sermon is for you
[1:32:57] this
[1:32:59] amen we have taken a portion of
[1:33:02] scripture from The Book of
[1:33:05] Numbers here Moses was under special
[1:33:09] assignment he was under a Divine
[1:33:14] assignment we did not come into the
[1:33:16] world to look
[1:33:18] around we are here on Divine assignment
[1:33:25] there is a one time a sermon I preached
[1:33:26] and I titled it um Divine connection for
[1:33:30] a Divine
[1:33:37] Purpose I almost preach it again this
[1:33:42] morning but then I'll take another turn
[1:33:44] today I believe with the people we meet
[1:33:48] in this
[1:33:49] life there is no one we meet by accident
[1:33:55] even you who is here this morning you
[1:33:56] are not here by
[1:33:59] accident and by the way good and bad
[1:34:03] people whoever you meet in this life
[1:34:07] there is a Divine
[1:34:10] appointment that God has planned before
[1:34:13] the foundation of the
[1:34:16] world you see to to be able to bring you
[1:34:18] to your
[1:34:21] purpose to be able to bring you to your
[1:34:23] go God given
[1:34:26] assignment now I remember I was in
[1:34:30] M as a young boy and they are you know
[1:34:34] raised in a
[1:34:35] family a Christian
[1:34:38] homean
[1:34:40] home but also they were part of the East
[1:34:42] African
[1:34:44] Revival we call it a
[1:34:48] movement so we were part of that it was
[1:34:52] not by coincidence
[1:34:54] even the family you were raised
[1:34:56] in was not by
[1:34:58] coincidence you should stop beating
[1:35:01] yourself and blaming yourself blaming
[1:35:05] your mother your father your
[1:35:06] friend your situations many of us don't
[1:35:11] progress to know the purpose of God for
[1:35:13] our
[1:35:13] Liv because we are always too good at
[1:35:16] muring and
[1:35:20] blaming we should begin seeing God in
[1:35:22] everything
[1:35:25] we should begin seeing God in everything
[1:35:27] that
[1:35:29] happen because if you are a child of
[1:35:34] God everything about you is
[1:35:38] planned everything about
[1:35:40] you is plan the good the bad
[1:35:46] the everything about you is a plan
[1:35:50] nothing is out of uh it's it's life
[1:35:56] nothing is wrong even the places you
[1:35:58] went through before even the places
[1:36:01] where you are now even the plac where
[1:36:04] you you are to
[1:36:05] be by God's grace I will show you
[1:36:07] everything is
[1:36:09] planned you are here to fulfill Your
[1:36:13] Divine
[1:36:16] assignment and you see and then you know
[1:36:19] in that
[1:36:20] family I get you know to Ane I think it
[1:36:24] was
[1:36:25] 11 and we had finished um the
[1:36:29] the they call I don't know how
[1:36:33] to confirmation
[1:36:36] ceremony after learning after being told
[1:36:38] for a
[1:36:39] while then the bishop comes and now he
[1:36:43] confirms
[1:37:02] and you know I would go before
[1:37:04] everybody and you know you have to walk
[1:37:07] majes even the cross we don't
[1:37:10] just felt we are really
[1:37:13] there that we are serving God you see
[1:37:17] that was by Divine
[1:37:19] appointment because go the journey was
[1:37:21] still
[1:37:22] moving God was still leading me so these
[1:37:26] denominations were of God or of the
[1:37:31] devil they are of
[1:37:33] God is the shark of the devil or of
[1:37:38] God it is of god but you see the seed
[1:37:42] cannot be here with a
[1:37:44] shark the SE the seed needs the
[1:37:48] shark but when the seed is
[1:37:51] rapen then the shark is not necessary
[1:37:54] so some of us or most of us have gone
[1:37:56] through the
[1:37:57] Shar we have gone through the
[1:38:00] process you know even when maze is
[1:38:04] growing it grows through all that kind
[1:38:06] of Stam and
[1:38:09] everything but it is not
[1:38:12] needed but there is a season there is a
[1:38:15] time when it is
[1:38:17] necessary so where you were
[1:38:20] before it was all necessary
[1:38:23] that you be here this
[1:38:25] morning so please pay attention to what
[1:38:27] is being said because by Divine
[1:38:31] appointment you are supposed to be here
[1:38:33] this
[1:38:35] morning and take you uh to my
[1:38:40] Palace because I was the one who was
[1:38:42] chosen to give the Thanksgiving
[1:38:47] speech and I spoke and I touched his
[1:38:51] hand and I found favor in his
[1:38:54] and he said Let Me Take You My Mother
[1:38:57] accepted right away my father did not
[1:39:02] accept you know he was also a priest and
[1:39:04] all that but he wanted to be with us to
[1:39:08] raise us himself but by God's grace and
[1:39:12] I say God's grace because there's
[1:39:14] nothing that can frustrate that grace of
[1:39:18] God every phase of life you will go
[1:39:23] through to attain what God has planned
[1:39:24] for you to
[1:39:27] attain Redemption has
[1:39:30] season one time we'll talk about that
[1:39:33] but then we see later on I come and
[1:39:36] begin living with the bishop
[1:39:38] and and then one time um so for the
[1:39:43] first time in my life at 13 years I was
[1:39:48] given a
[1:39:49] Pulpit in a big church of about 400
[1:39:55] people that night I never
[1:39:57] slept I was
[1:39:59] shaking because they told me to tomorrow
[1:40:02] you'll
[1:40:04] be and I know when the bishop visits a
[1:40:07] place there so many people that come
[1:40:10] many many every so before everybody I
[1:40:15] was to be there it was by Divine
[1:40:19] appointment and um I I I by the time I
[1:40:22] came to the pool
[1:40:24] no they are not as small as
[1:40:26] this they are very large and you have to
[1:40:30] climb to go there so as I was
[1:40:33] climbing my feet was shaking my feet was
[1:40:37] shaking and then I reached there my
[1:40:40] Bible you know was in I started reading
[1:40:42] the scripture and preach when I started
[1:40:44] reading then the anointing Came Upon and
[1:40:47] I preached and many people came to give
[1:40:50] their life to Jesus about 100 people
[1:40:53] those were my first Souls War to
[1:40:56] Lord in the Anglican Church the bishop
[1:40:59] came and he prayed over them the
[1:41:02] blessing of the father and of the Son
[1:41:04] and the ghost amen but within all that
[1:41:10] God was leading his
[1:41:12] child and at
[1:41:14] 15 um long St short God in the place
[1:41:20] where the bishop took me
[1:41:23] that same city that same town God had
[1:41:27] something in
[1:41:29] mind to introduce this message to
[1:41:34] me so if I had not been in the
[1:41:38] Ang if I had not met the people I
[1:41:43] met if I had not come
[1:41:46] toana I would not have known this
[1:41:51] message and if I had not known this
[1:41:54] message I would not have known who I
[1:41:57] am and if I had not known who I am maybe
[1:42:01] I would have missed the
[1:42:03] Rapture so can I would I be right to
[1:42:06] say I was everything was under Divine
[1:42:12] appointment tell your neighbor you are
[1:42:14] not here by
[1:42:17] AC nothing happens by
[1:42:20] accident to a child of God nothing
[1:42:23] happens by
[1:42:25] accident and nothing happens by
[1:42:29] coincidence everything that happens in
[1:42:31] your life you must begin to learn to
[1:42:34] appreciate
[1:42:35] God and thank him for leading you
[1:42:39] because the Bible says the footsteps of
[1:42:41] the
[1:42:43] righteous who are the Righteous the ones
[1:42:46] who have been
[1:42:48] forn the ones who have been
[1:42:50] predestinated
[1:42:53] and been chosen in him before the
[1:42:56] foundation of the world those people
[1:42:59] they are
[1:43:00] footsteps are ordered of the
[1:43:03] Lord now I believe your
[1:43:07] footsteps are being ordered of the
[1:43:10] Lord but you see you are a human being
[1:43:14] but you are a human being under Divine
[1:43:19] assignment you must Find Your Divine
[1:43:22] assignment
[1:43:24] and God even before you were
[1:43:26] born he knew what you will do when you
[1:43:28] are
[1:43:31] born he knew what you will
[1:43:33] accomplish but the reason why many
[1:43:36] people don't do what God wanted them to
[1:43:39] do because they are not sensitive to the
[1:43:41] leadership of the Holy
[1:43:46] Spirit to know what God is
[1:43:49] doing many people miss it
[1:43:53] I was in the city of Adis
[1:43:56] Ababa the first time we went
[1:43:58] there and then we were singing I was
[1:44:02] with a brother from
[1:44:03] Nairobi and um we were singing I don't
[1:44:07] remember the song but we were walking on
[1:44:09] the streets and singing and then there's
[1:44:12] a man who tapped on my
[1:44:14] shoulder and he said Hallelujah
[1:44:17] hallu turn to see later on I would find
[1:44:20] out he's a pastor
[1:44:23] and his name is John I I'll withhold the
[1:44:26] other name and then we sat down because
[1:44:29] we so excited to find someone who is a
[1:44:32] Christian and as we sat down there he
[1:44:36] looked at us and then he looked me in
[1:44:39] the eyes and he said I
[1:44:41] see a
[1:44:43] light there is a light on on your
[1:44:46] head and I see that you have a pure
[1:44:51] message God has sent to this country
[1:44:54] with a pure message and it is for the
[1:44:57] entire
[1:44:58] country and he has given you an
[1:45:01] open and no man will close
[1:45:04] it now when he say those words I was
[1:45:08] excited not because um I already knew
[1:45:11] what he was
[1:45:13] saying already I
[1:45:16] knew the devil knew that there was
[1:45:20] someone going to be born
[1:45:23] under a Divine
[1:45:24] assignment to destroy my kingdom we are
[1:45:28] born into the kingdom of God to destroy
[1:45:32] the kingdom of
[1:45:33] dark and here is the good news the devil
[1:45:37] knows it by the way the devil knows who
[1:45:40] you
[1:45:41] are it is only you who has not realized
[1:45:44] yet who you
[1:45:46] are but the devil knows if you're a
[1:45:49] child of God the devil knows you
[1:45:53] if you want to try
[1:45:55] it you go to
[1:45:59] nightclub they will ask you people who
[1:46:01] don't even know you even you are
[1:46:07] here cuz they will realize you are a
[1:46:10] different
[1:46:12] person many times you walk out
[1:46:14] there we even dressing
[1:46:17] Cas and someone says oh Pastor have you
[1:46:20] ever met me but you look like
[1:46:25] people know
[1:46:26] you the devil knows you God knows you
[1:46:30] you know
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:34] yourself listen the devil knew uh
[1:46:39] Moses and Moses was born and the devil
[1:46:42] thought he would kill him but you see he
[1:46:45] cannot kill someone who has a Divine
[1:46:51] assignment if if you have a
[1:46:54] purpose in this world the devil cannot
[1:46:57] finish you before your
[1:47:01] time there is no amount of
[1:47:04] suffering that will finish you before
[1:47:06] your
[1:47:06] die there is no amount of lack of fear
[1:47:10] or
[1:47:10] whatever even your birth
[1:47:14] circumstances cannot finish you before
[1:47:17] you
[1:47:18] time we have to stop being
[1:47:21] sorry about families we were born in we
[1:47:25] have to stop being
[1:47:26] sorry about the situations we found
[1:47:28] ourselves in we have to stop being sorry
[1:47:32] about even the things we found that
[1:47:34] happen in our
[1:47:35] life because everything is happening by
[1:47:40] Design why because there is a Divine
[1:47:44] assignment for me for
[1:47:46] you let's start together as I build
[1:47:49] this and then Moses reached a Time
[1:47:53] and then they picked him and um you know
[1:47:57] and they took him to the Palace of
[1:48:01] the and when I was thinking about that I
[1:48:03] thought about myself going
[1:48:06] to Pharaoh's
[1:48:08] Palace but you know friends you too some
[1:48:12] of you were in Pharaoh's
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:16] pal great Prestige and power
[1:48:21] money but no word
[1:48:24] not
[1:48:25] true how many were
[1:48:29] there look at those
[1:48:31] hands some of you were
[1:48:34] not but most of you
[1:48:36] I in those
[1:48:39] palaces and here I mean any denomination
[1:48:42] that is not word
[1:48:46] best and Moses was there Moses was
[1:48:49] trained for 40 years and Moes now got um
[1:48:55] this kind of thinking that he's now one
[1:48:57] of the
[1:49:00] best he can now destroy all the
[1:49:04] enemies he has the power he has the
[1:49:06] authority he was almost the next
[1:49:12] Pharaoh listen and by saying this before
[1:49:16] I
[1:49:17] continue if you go to the lineage of
[1:49:20] Cain the lineage of C there were great
[1:49:24] people the people who had gone into
[1:49:26] great education
[1:49:28] programs people who understood all
[1:49:32] Myst to the extent they even wanted to
[1:49:36] build a tower to reach
[1:49:39] God and even God said they will they
[1:49:41] were going to
[1:49:43] fulfill these were knowledgeable
[1:49:46] men there are people of power and
[1:49:49] influence but when you go to the line of
[1:49:52] of sat
[1:49:55] they were humble people they were
[1:49:57] shepherds they did not have much
[1:49:59] accolades in this
[1:50:01] life if you read in the New Testament
[1:50:04] the Bible says not many great are
[1:50:09] called not many Rich are
[1:50:12] called I tell you for sure if you look
[1:50:15] at all the
[1:50:17] demographics the whole world and you
[1:50:20] look at Christianity
[1:50:23] there are very few Christians who are
[1:50:26] great people in this
[1:50:28] life most of the
[1:50:30] Christians most of the Jesus
[1:50:33] followers are humble people they don't
[1:50:37] have much in this
[1:50:38] life they don't have much to to to to to
[1:50:42] to tie
[1:50:43] on they don't have high high
[1:50:46] education
[1:50:48] qualifications they don't have you know
[1:50:50] big buildings
[1:50:53] they don't own molds and you know
[1:50:56] airplanes and and good things there are
[1:51:00] few who do the Bible says so there are
[1:51:03] few there few Among Us and those who
[1:51:06] were put among us we also put Among Us
[1:51:09] for a
[1:51:11] purpose if you find yourself in the body
[1:51:14] of Christ and you have in this material
[1:51:19] world more things than others
[1:51:23] it is not for
[1:51:24] you unless if you're not a sincere
[1:51:27] Christian but if you're a sincere
[1:51:29] Christian and you have more than others
[1:51:32] whatever you have is for the entire body
[1:51:36] so you must always be given to the
[1:51:37] distribution of the
[1:51:40] Saints amen that's the purpose why God
[1:51:43] makes some of us
[1:51:46] rich God his economy is very
[1:51:49] good he doesn't want his children to beg
[1:51:52] out
[1:51:54] those who have he says give especially
[1:51:59] in the
[1:52:01] household first in here then out there
[1:52:05] so if you have anything in this
[1:52:07] life it is not for you and for your
[1:52:11] family only it is for the body of Jesus
[1:52:15] Christ amen and we will find out more on
[1:52:18] that now we see there are not many
[1:52:21] children of God
[1:52:23] who have great things in
[1:52:25] this now you can debate with
[1:52:28] that but you go and and make your
[1:52:31] research you will not find much many of
[1:52:35] them were were what we would call
[1:52:39] Poor to the extent the disciples came to
[1:52:42] Jesus and they said for sure we who have
[1:52:46] left our houses
[1:52:47] our families our things what are we
[1:52:51] going to get in return
[1:52:54] because they realize this thing is
[1:52:56] true but it doesn't have much to
[1:53:00] it there are many people who have
[1:53:03] refused to preach this
[1:53:05] message not because it is not true but
[1:53:08] because if you preach this you will not
[1:53:11] get much
[1:53:14] money the message the kind of message we
[1:53:17] preach in message churches all over the
[1:53:21] world is not one that will make a Pastor
[1:53:26] Rich it
[1:53:28] cannot I will be sincere with you all
[1:53:31] you younger preachers here if you have
[1:53:33] been
[1:53:34] planning on that American kind of
[1:53:38] Dream by this
[1:53:41] message you better find another
[1:53:45] message because this message the purpose
[1:53:48] of this message is not to enrich us
[1:53:52] in worldly goods and
[1:53:55] materials
[1:53:57] no God will
[1:53:59] provide don't don't make a mistake with
[1:54:01] that he will always provide but I'm
[1:54:04] talking about enriching
[1:54:06] ourselves like what you see happen out
[1:54:09] there oh and then they drive private JS
[1:54:13] and drive huge cars and bigs and all is
[1:54:18] owned by a
[1:54:19] pastor why because he has made many
[1:54:23] collection from the people and the
[1:54:25] people give
[1:54:27] will because of the man is
[1:54:30] Anointed are you saying we have no
[1:54:32] anointing in the message sure we have
[1:54:34] anointing in the
[1:54:35] message but with the way we operate is
[1:54:39] we don't measure on a
[1:54:42] minor we measure on the
[1:54:44] major and the Maj is the soul the major
[1:54:48] is the rapture the Maj is the coming of
[1:54:51] the Lord the rest is just an
[1:54:54] addition so you can never preach this
[1:54:58] message expecting to become
[1:55:00] rich because for sure the way we preach
[1:55:02] to you you don't even want to give us a
[1:55:05] lot of
[1:55:07] money because we don't make you
[1:55:09] happy but if I come here on one Sunday
[1:55:12] morning even if it is a message
[1:55:15] church and I make you happy prach what
[1:55:18] you want to hear you'll be so happy that
[1:55:21] even your it will
[1:55:24] be but the gospel I
[1:55:27] found in the Bible is that which is of
[1:55:30] without money without
[1:55:33] price freely you have received
[1:55:36] fre that is our divine
[1:55:40] assignment to preach
[1:55:42] Christ amen not to preach to make you
[1:55:46] happy but to preach Christ into your
[1:55:49] heart that you may get an experience
[1:55:51] with God
[1:55:53] amen if God blesses you with worldly
[1:55:56] Goods we thank
[1:55:59] God and he has taught us how we can be
[1:56:01] blessed with the worldly
[1:56:04] things by
[1:56:06] working
[1:56:10] hard I hope I'm not offending some
[1:56:15] already someone say Pastor don't you
[1:56:17] think that believing the message is
[1:56:18] already making you rich no
[1:56:24] you can go to heaven poor you can go to
[1:56:26] heaven Rich it doesn't
[1:56:29] matter but if you want to be rich
[1:56:35] work he promised a
[1:56:37] blessing as long as you you walk and you
[1:56:40] follow the kingdom
[1:56:43] principles there is a blessing to
[1:56:46] eat that's why when we preach this
[1:56:50] message We Don't Preach a message of
[1:56:55] receive receive it receive it this
[1:56:57] message is a higher
[1:57:00] Revelation higher
[1:57:02] understanding but but let me take you
[1:57:04] deeper here in the life
[1:57:06] of so you will understand what I'm
[1:57:08] talking
[1:57:09] about now um I'll quote first of all in
[1:57:12] the message
[1:57:14] Fellowship our Prophet says each one of
[1:57:16] us has a different
[1:57:19] Ministry so meaning each one of us has a
[1:57:21] Ministry
[1:57:23] each one works
[1:57:26] different each one of you has a
[1:57:30] Ministry a separate
[1:57:33] Ministry all that come into Christ has a
[1:57:38] Ministry not one not only the
[1:57:41] preacher but you have a Ministry to
[1:57:45] something something you can
[1:57:49] do and I hope this doesn't sound
[1:57:51] sacriligious
[1:57:53] but usually God has to drive you into
[1:57:56] your
[1:58:02] ministry I am showing you that when you
[1:58:05] come to the Lord there is a Divine
[1:58:08] assignment
[1:58:10] you if you've not found
[1:58:12] it amen it is going to find you this
[1:58:17] morning the assignment is going to find
[1:58:19] you this
[1:58:20] morning there is something you must
[1:58:23] do every one of us sisters brothers
[1:58:29] young preachers and non prach all of us
[1:58:32] have a
[1:58:33] Ministry and this is something that you
[1:58:36] can
[1:58:38] do that's why you should never accept to
[1:58:40] be a dant Body of
[1:58:44] Christ imagine if you have
[1:58:47] hands that are not cannot touch
[1:58:50] anything feet that can't MO
[1:58:53] you are
[1:58:55] lame and many parts of the
[1:58:58] body are
[1:59:00] dment you see a brother you see a sister
[1:59:04] who will never be useful in the
[1:59:07] body there is something you can
[1:59:11] do you are here for a Divine
[1:59:15] assignment there is something you and I
[1:59:17] can
[1:59:18] do but you see usually God will dri you
[1:59:22] into your
[1:59:25] ministry you can drive yourself into
[1:59:28] some
[1:59:30] Ministry but God will always drive you
[1:59:32] into your
[1:59:36] correct in 1 Corinthians
[1:59:38] 12 it says now ye are the body of
[1:59:41] Christ and your members in
[1:59:44] particular and God has said some in the
[1:59:48] church first apostles Prophets
[1:59:52] teachers then
[1:59:54] Miracles gift of healing
[1:59:58] helps
[2:00:01] governments I don't know whether you
[2:00:02] call it but I think governments is you
[2:00:06] know management and all that kind of
[2:00:08] thing diversities of
[2:00:10] tongues all and and then he asks a
[2:00:13] question are all
[2:00:15] Apostles are all prophets are all
[2:00:18] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[2:00:21] have all the gifts of
[2:00:23] healing do all speak with
[2:00:25] Tong do all interpret the answer is
[2:00:29] obviously no but in verse four he says
[2:00:33] there are diversities of
[2:00:35] gifts but the same spirit and there are
[2:00:38] differences of
[2:00:41] administrations but the same Lord there
[2:00:44] are diversities of
[2:00:47] operations but the same God who work all
[2:00:50] in all
[2:00:52] but the manifestation of the
[2:00:54] spirit is given to every
[2:00:58] man every man to profit with for to one
[2:01:03] is given by the spirit Word of
[2:01:06] Wisdom to another word of
[2:01:09] knowledge to another Faith by The Same
[2:01:12] Spirit to another Gifts of healing to
[2:01:16] another working of
[2:01:17] mirac to another prophecy Des signing of
[2:01:21] spirits
[2:01:23] of um and another one diverse kinds of
[2:01:26] times and another one interpretation of
[2:01:29] times but all
[2:01:32] these work that
[2:01:34] one it says work that one and the self
[2:01:38] Same Spirit divide into every man sever
[2:01:41] as he
[2:01:47] will for as the body is one and has many
[2:01:51] members
[2:01:52] and all the members of that one
[2:01:55] body being many are one
[2:01:59] body so also is
[2:02:01] Christ and there are many many many
[2:02:05] Ministries it could be just
[2:02:09] marriage you're just a
[2:02:11] housewife that's a big big
[2:02:14] Ministry could be a
[2:02:18] husband it's a Ministry a father is
[2:02:22] Ministry mother so family is Minister
[2:02:26] own that's why the Bible even qualifies
[2:02:30] a
[2:02:32] pastor he says if a pastor if someone
[2:02:35] wants to be a
[2:02:37] pastor he must be first a successful
[2:02:41] father and
[2:02:46] husband you read your Bible in the book
[2:02:49] of First
[2:02:50] Timothy he says he if a man does not
[2:02:53] know how to rule his own
[2:02:55] house how shall he rule over the Church
[2:02:58] of
[2:02:58] God so if a pastor's home goes you know
[2:03:02] breaks
[2:03:03] apart many still
[2:03:06] insist I have the calling I have the
[2:03:08] calling you may have the calling but you
[2:03:10] don't have the
[2:03:12] qualification because what qualifies you
[2:03:16] is your success at
[2:03:19] home there is no way you can make the
[2:03:22] Church of God
[2:03:24] Prosper if your wife and children and
[2:03:27] and and home is not
[2:03:29] [Music]
[2:03:31] prospering so first you prosper
[2:03:34] your then the Church of God and it's the
[2:03:38] same qualifications even for
[2:03:42] deacons you see they must be married to
[2:03:45] one wife not two not
[2:03:47] three and they must be prospering
[2:03:51] marriage they must be prospering in
[2:03:54] their family if someone is the one who
[2:03:57] always beats his
[2:03:58] wife he does not qualify even to be a
[2:04:03] Deon because he has not prospered
[2:04:06] there so you see that these are all
[2:04:09] Ministries some people are given to
[2:04:13] prayer praying for the church praying
[2:04:15] for the needs of the people you know you
[2:04:18] know that is maybe a calling that you
[2:04:21] have
[2:04:23] and you know you don't want to do it
[2:04:26] some of God will drive you into
[2:04:29] it it's not because you want to do it
[2:04:32] it's because God
[2:04:34] himself will drive you into
[2:04:37] that you see it might be
[2:04:39] music musicians and administrators
[2:04:43] and media Department whatever you are
[2:04:47] this is all Ministry even cleaning the
[2:04:50] church it's all Ministry helping it's
[2:04:54] all Ministry you know um whether you
[2:04:57] children or young or other all of you
[2:05:02] can be used by the
[2:05:03] Lord you all have a
[2:05:06] Ministry and here I will continue here
[2:05:08] on this quote it
[2:05:10] says some Methodist Brethren the other
[2:05:13] day had just received the Holy Ghost
[2:05:16] there are farmers up in
[2:05:18] Indiana they was just all on fire
[2:05:22] and he said I've been reading some
[2:05:25] books and he said brother bam should we
[2:05:28] all come together now and seek our
[2:05:32] ministry and seek for our
[2:05:36] ministry did you hear
[2:05:41] that many people try to do
[2:05:44] that oh let me go on the mountain and
[2:05:47] pray for 30 days and seek for my
[2:05:51] Ministry
[2:05:53] have you heard of that
[2:05:55] before it's not the way we do
[2:05:58] it there is no God called
[2:06:03] Minister that will seek their
[2:06:06] Ministry actually every God called
[2:06:09] Minister will try to run away from their
[2:06:14] Min and you find the ones who want
[2:06:16] always to do
[2:06:18] something they are the ones who don't
[2:06:19] have the anointing for it
[2:06:22] they the ones who don't have the calling
[2:06:26] for you find it
[2:06:28] true even if it's just we can take it as
[2:06:31] low marriage
[2:06:33] issue you find that the woman goes to a
[2:06:36] man and begins to talk about
[2:06:40] our the man is not
[2:06:43] interested because you're not supposed
[2:06:45] to seek
[2:06:47] yourself the man is supposed to seek
[2:06:53] brother are you praying about
[2:06:56] marriage what are you thinking
[2:07:00] about a sister who does that is of a bad
[2:07:06] character he's of a bad
[2:07:09] character the husband seeks
[2:07:11] you he seeks you and he finds you and he
[2:07:15] picks you how many here sld
[2:07:20] themselves Jesus s us we never
[2:07:26] [Applause]
[2:07:29] our you don't seek
[2:07:32] Lord seeks I am here because he
[2:07:39] me the more I continue to
[2:07:41] run the more you Contin seeking after me
[2:07:45] and I am here today because he found
[2:07:49] me Hallelujah amen that's why
[2:07:53] salvation is not your
[2:07:56] work it is a work of
[2:07:59] God Amen God will accomplish
[2:08:02] it he started it by dying on the cross
[2:08:07] he will finish it by saying all the
[2:08:12] savable who are the
[2:08:14] savable those who he chosen
[2:08:17] him before the foundation of the world
[2:08:21] they are the
[2:08:22] savable I am one of them I am
[2:08:26] savable if you are savable when you hear
[2:08:30] the word you will recognize it you will
[2:08:33] have something like we call
[2:08:36] whatever something like I remember
[2:08:43] this this is
[2:08:46] familiar you you may even hear it for
[2:08:48] the first
[2:08:49] time but something in
[2:08:52] will say I relate with that I believe
[2:08:55] that that sounds like
[2:09:01] home to respond to the word of
[2:09:06] God so he so
[2:09:08] us even
[2:09:10] Ministry you don't have to go this man
[2:09:13] came here and asked by
[2:09:15] the should we come
[2:09:17] together and we we all pray and seek our
[2:09:24] ministry but B answer and he said I said
[2:09:28] no you will Rin yourself doing
[2:09:31] that you will rein yourself doing
[2:09:34] that I said you don't do
[2:09:37] that I said a man that always seeking
[2:09:40] for God to do
[2:09:43] something such and such and such
[2:09:46] things usually don't amount to very much
[2:09:52] it is the
[2:09:53] man that doesn't want to do
[2:09:56] it it is the man it is the
[2:10:01] man that doesn't want to do it that's
[2:10:04] the one that God can
[2:10:08] use look
[2:10:13] at give me money give me money if you
[2:10:17] give me money I am going to buy the
[2:10:20] church land
[2:10:22] if you give me money I'm going to do
[2:10:24] this see Believers in church are
[2:10:26] suffering if you give me money I am
[2:10:29] going to help other
[2:10:32] one that's the man that will never do
[2:10:38] it if you want to know
[2:10:41] yourself see where you are now and what
[2:10:44] you're doing now is what you will do
[2:10:47] when you get a lot more than what you
[2:10:49] don't have
[2:10:56] if you have 5,000 and you can't give
[2:10:58] 3,000 to
[2:11:01] God even if you get 40
[2:11:04] million you can't give him one
[2:11:06] million are
[2:11:08] you that's why many of your prayers are
[2:11:10] not
[2:11:15] answered listen and things like that God
[2:11:19] knows he would you know God you use word
[2:11:23] here God knows that he such a person
[2:11:25] would be a stuffed
[2:11:30] shirt so he just takes
[2:11:33] somebody that doesn't want to do
[2:11:36] it and say maybe I can use him a little
[2:11:40] while till he gets to be
[2:11:42] one you remember ABS the son of um uh of
[2:11:48] um of David I believe it was
[2:11:51] and then this boy you know was going
[2:11:54] down to the
[2:11:56] gates waiting for the people to
[2:11:58] come so he can tell them oh you want to
[2:12:02] see my
[2:12:03] father yes we have an issue
[2:12:06] here don't bother my
[2:12:09] father my father is very
[2:12:11] busy but don't worry me I'm around I'm
[2:12:15] around I can help you and then they then
[2:12:19] he handles them and they and they go
[2:12:22] away
[2:12:23] say it is a very good brother
[2:12:26] here he's even better than our
[2:12:30] King and then
[2:12:32] eventually he sto their
[2:12:34] hearts he sto their
[2:12:36] hearts and then he caused a REV
[2:12:39] happen but did he ever become a
[2:12:42] king he died before he became
[2:12:47] aing he was not the man for the job
[2:12:51] it is always the man who runs
[2:12:55] away God doesn't want to look at this
[2:13:01] one I qualify he leaves that one and he
[2:13:06] goes for the one running away and he
[2:13:09] says you come I want to use you there is
[2:13:12] a work for you to do hallelujah amen
[2:13:17] it's the same yesterday to
[2:13:19] Forever this is always the way God
[2:13:24] works and this applies in every
[2:13:30] everywhere
[2:13:32] amen so some of you who have been
[2:13:35] waiting to
[2:13:37] serve it's not about you qu it is not
[2:13:41] about you put yourself putting yourself
[2:13:43] in the position it's about
[2:13:46] God choosing
[2:13:50] you so that's about it you try to get
[2:13:53] away from it all the
[2:13:55] time great Ministries has always been
[2:13:58] somebody trying to get away from
[2:14:00] [Music]
[2:14:02] it because let God do something for
[2:14:06] them and then they all puffed
[2:14:09] up how
[2:14:12] great and everything but a man that
[2:14:15] doesn't want to do
[2:14:17] it he just forced to to do it
[2:14:21] and then he wants to get away from it as
[2:14:23] big as he
[2:14:24] can that's the way usually God
[2:14:27] works now we look at
[2:14:30] Moses Moses was trained up in the
[2:14:35] Pharaoh
[2:14:36] Palace for a number of years 40 years
[2:14:40] and I want now to show you here in the
[2:14:42] Bible if you can open with me to the
[2:14:46] book of um
[2:14:49] Exodus and I want you to look at um
[2:14:52] chapter
[2:15:01] 2 vers
[2:15:08] 11 and it came to pass in those days
[2:15:11] when Moses was grown that he went out
[2:15:15] into his uh unto his Brethren and looked
[2:15:17] on their burdens and he spied on
[2:15:19] Egyptians smiting and Hebrew one of his
[2:15:37] breth and he looked this way and that
[2:15:42] way and when he saw that there was no
[2:15:45] man he SLE the Egyptians and the son
[2:15:57] and when he went out of the second day
[2:15:59] behold two men of the Hebrews stro
[2:16:01] together and he said to to him that did
[2:16:05] wrong why do you smite your fellow and
[2:16:07] he said who made you a prince and a
[2:16:09] judge over us intend thou to kill me as
[2:16:12] thou killed the Egyptian and Moses
[2:16:14] feared and said surely this thing is
[2:16:17] known
[2:16:45] now I want you to see Moses felt
[2:16:48] empowered
[2:16:52] he was empowered by
[2:16:55] education imagine if you have been
[2:16:57] educated by the best for 40
[2:17:01] years Moses was empowered by
[2:17:06] education Moses was
[2:17:09] empowered according to him he felt his
[2:17:12] own
[2:17:15] efforts he was able to serve
[2:17:18] Israel and he today we would call it
[2:17:24] theology you know man you see they have
[2:17:26] the big
[2:17:28] titles h d l l
[2:17:30] d and and many other powerful loud
[2:17:35] titles the world gives them accolades
[2:17:38] and the world Praises them if you
[2:17:42] mention
[2:17:43] yourself as um uh p h d l l d s s what
[2:17:50] what
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:55] by the time you mention your
[2:17:57] name people already
[2:18:00] shaking this must be a big person one
[2:18:03] day I was in um at some
[2:18:06] airport I met a man from Nigeria and I
[2:18:10] asked him his name by the time he
[2:18:12] mentioned his
[2:18:14] name I was already
[2:18:16] tired because he mentioned a lot of
[2:18:19] tit apostle the most Prophet you know
[2:18:24] bishop and and then finally later on he
[2:18:29] mentioned the name I am so glad we have
[2:18:32] received a prophet in our generation who
[2:18:35] has preached a sermon BL famous
[2:18:39] names we are delivered from
[2:18:41] that amen hallelujah we have pastors we
[2:18:47] have brothers and pastors are brothers
[2:18:49] and brothers are pastors
[2:18:53] hallelujah amen men of God are
[2:18:57] men there is something I'm trying to
[2:18:59] build to
[2:19:00] here if you want to be used by
[2:19:03] God you must realize you are nothing you
[2:19:06] have nothing you can do
[2:19:09] nothing you have to humble
[2:19:12] yourself you have to see nothing good
[2:19:14] about
[2:19:16] yourself but here is a
[2:19:19] man called Dr
[2:19:22] Moses I don't know the titles they were
[2:19:24] giving at that
[2:19:26] time maybe
[2:19:29] honorable
[2:19:31] honorable you know the most
[2:19:38] whatever you know
[2:19:40] man in the all of you know
[2:19:44] Egypt and all those
[2:19:46] titles then they say Moses
[2:19:51] he comes out of that kind of
[2:19:55] training and he feels the
[2:19:58] strength you know they say I feel the
[2:20:00] anointing is it the anointing of
[2:20:03] theology or the anointing of the
[2:20:05] word but I'm so glad God still has
[2:20:08] people anointed by the true spirit of
[2:20:11] God who respond to the true word of
[2:20:15] God Amen and and so they were anointed
[2:20:19] by the word
[2:20:21] but here Moses was not anointed by the
[2:20:24] word he was anointed by
[2:20:27] training he was anointed by
[2:20:30] education and by the way make no mistake
[2:20:33] I we support
[2:20:37] education but I'm saying when you are
[2:20:39] serving God you put all your education
[2:20:45] aside we don't care whether you you have
[2:20:48] a a PhD or l l or you know when it comes
[2:20:53] to serving
[2:20:54] God you forget about all those things or
[2:20:58] whether you have a bachelor or a diploma
[2:21:02] some people they just can't can't can't
[2:21:05] operate without thinking about what they
[2:21:07] have achieved in this
[2:21:12] life you have to think of yourself as
[2:21:15] though you are
[2:21:17] n and here this man came and uh he
[2:21:21] looked at this man fighting he knew he
[2:21:25] was a
[2:21:27] Jew but he had all his
[2:21:31] authority so he said you why are you
[2:21:34] killing your
[2:21:35] neighbor why you fighting so he looked
[2:21:38] here looked here this is a man who is
[2:21:43] very don't know the word to use very
[2:21:47] subtle
[2:21:49] wisdom look
[2:21:53] around no one then he got this man M his
[2:22:06] name and then he came
[2:22:08] out hallelujah hallelujah you know he's
[2:22:11] a man of God how many believe mes is a
[2:22:13] man of
[2:22:14] God he was a man of did you actually
[2:22:17] know Moses mured
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:25] like but there's a difference between
[2:22:32] Andes I want you to understand it's not
[2:22:35] the
[2:22:36] action is the
[2:22:40] person that is deep if you
[2:22:44] receive but then this man murdered this
[2:22:48] man and buried him
[2:22:51] and he came out as if nothing happened
[2:22:53] and the next time he came out ready to
[2:22:55] do the
[2:22:56] same you so now this time it was two
[2:23:00] Hebrews fighting he looked at the one
[2:23:03] who did
[2:23:03] wrong you why are you doing
[2:23:07] this this said ah you want to kill me
[2:23:11] the way you killed the
[2:23:13] other that's when Moses
[2:23:16] realized I am
[2:23:17] busted so I am known so my weakness is
[2:23:23] discovered I can't serve God
[2:23:26] now what was it doing in the
[2:23:29] beginning don't you ever think he was
[2:23:33] murdering he thought he was actually
[2:23:36] saving
[2:23:38] his and oh my God help us that's what
[2:23:42] all these denominations are
[2:23:45] doing they are murdering the people but
[2:23:48] they think they saving
[2:23:52] by preaching wrong
[2:23:53] Doctrine by preaching the Trinity do by
[2:23:57] accepting things the
[2:23:59] Bible by telling everybody speak
[2:24:02] T the Bible is very clear how the gift
[2:24:05] of T must
[2:24:08] operate by teaching
[2:24:11] disgrace instead of teaching real
[2:24:14] Grace they are doing what muring the
[2:24:17] people telling them it doesn't matter
[2:24:19] what you drink
[2:24:21] God SE your heart not your body they are
[2:24:24] Ming those
[2:24:26] women they don't know they think they
[2:24:29] saving
[2:24:30] them why because of theology because of
[2:24:33] their church doctr let me tell you
[2:24:36] brother it doesn't matter the education
[2:24:38] you have it doesn't matter which level
[2:24:42] of understanding you think you
[2:24:44] on until you humble
[2:24:47] yourself and you and you know that God
[2:24:50] has to lead
[2:24:52] you you are
[2:24:55] nothing this Moses was uh you know
[2:24:58] muring these
[2:24:59] people thinking is
[2:25:04] saving that's the organized Church
[2:25:07] religion that's what they
[2:25:10] doing even this morning some people are
[2:25:13] being
[2:25:15] murdered this
[2:25:18] this they're being murdered
[2:25:21] and they don't
[2:25:22] know they don't know they going to they
[2:25:26] are going to
[2:25:27] altars but
[2:25:30] altars they the
[2:25:34] sacrifice they being
[2:25:38] sacrific but friends we must go an
[2:25:42] altar where Christ is the
[2:25:45] sacrifice Hallelujah where our work
[2:25:48] should be to receive the word
[2:25:52] amen just receive the word if you don't
[2:25:55] receive the word you are you yourself
[2:25:58] being
[2:26:00] sacrificed you are losing your
[2:26:02] soul but if you receive the word you are
[2:26:06] receiving the sacrifice that has already
[2:26:08] been given
[2:26:12] amen but we see here amen that
[2:26:16] Moses when he realized his weakness was
[2:26:19] discovered
[2:26:22] I'm sure his feet must
[2:26:24] have he realized all the training he had
[2:26:29] received from the best military school
[2:26:32] in the
[2:26:33] world was now
[2:26:36] nothing at first he felt
[2:26:38] empowered but when his weakness was
[2:26:41] discovered in
[2:26:42] him he realized he was so
[2:26:46] weak and Brethren may God help us to
[2:26:50] realize we are so
[2:26:54] weak that we can be a now to come to a
[2:26:58] place as I show you that Moses came
[2:27:02] where I can be able to
[2:27:05] confess that I am but a
[2:27:08] [Music]
[2:27:10] man in the message
[2:27:13] absolute Moses why he had tried to save
[2:27:16] the life of those poor Hebrews
[2:27:20] almost as bad
[2:27:22] off these two children are were trying
[2:27:24] to save to it says these were
[2:27:28] slaves and they killed them just at
[2:27:33] random whenever they wanted to Moses
[2:27:36] filed in his
[2:27:38] heart that you know that was not the
[2:27:40] will of
[2:27:41] God so he tried to do
[2:27:44] it through education he tried to do it
[2:27:48] through his own efforts and found out
[2:27:51] that he miserably
[2:27:53] failed he did something that wasn't
[2:27:57] right because he took another man's life
[2:28:01] and that was not right when I was in the
[2:28:03] Anglican Church for two years I tried to
[2:28:07] save my people but I found out I was
[2:28:11] just murdering them but then the great
[2:28:15] light The Shining Light the word of God
[2:28:20] shined my
[2:28:22] way shined your way and we came out of
[2:28:26] her the Bible says come out of all my
[2:28:29] people who is she she's a false
[2:28:33] religion this message is are calling out
[2:28:38] come out of them come out of organized
[2:28:41] religion come out of manmade
[2:28:43] systems go where not into another
[2:28:46] denomination not into another church go
[2:28:50] into
[2:28:51] Christ we have been called not just to
[2:28:54] start a
[2:28:56] movement Hallelujah but to come into
[2:28:59] Christ and you know I always say we are
[2:29:03] everywhere in the
[2:29:05] world we are not
[2:29:08] organized but we are not
[2:29:11] disorganized our head is Christ Our
[2:29:14] headquarter is in heaven our Arch Bishop
[2:29:18] is Jesus Christ
[2:29:20] our
[2:29:21] Authority is the
[2:29:23] Bible That's The Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:29:26] that's the Church of Christ that he said
[2:29:29] is coming back forth who has no spot no
[2:29:34] wrinkle but washing the blood of
[2:29:38] the amen am can you say
[2:29:41] Amen in the book of Exodus chapter
[2:29:44] 3 and then here now Moses has realized
[2:29:48] he is
[2:29:50] he
[2:29:52] says come now there God talks to
[2:29:55] him I will send the to Pharaoh that thou
[2:29:59] may bring forth my
[2:30:01] people the children of Israel out
[2:30:04] of and Moses said to God who am
[2:30:09] [Music]
[2:30:12] I that I I I should go to
[2:30:18] pharaoh who am I
[2:30:21] that I should bring forth the children
[2:30:23] of
[2:30:25] Israel out of Egypt meaning meaning this
[2:30:29] man is now
[2:30:31] shocked that God actually
[2:30:34] thought that he can actually do
[2:30:37] this oh my let me tell you the way to
[2:30:42] know God is calling you into any
[2:30:46] Ministry it will never be obvious
[2:30:51] it will shock you it will surprise
[2:30:54] you it will be bigger than
[2:30:57] you it is not a
[2:31:00] vision until it is bigger than
[2:31:05] you let me tell you God has called you
[2:31:10] each of you each of us to
[2:31:13] accomplish certain Divine
[2:31:16] assignments in this life but those
[2:31:19] Divine assignment
[2:31:21] are actually bigger than
[2:31:25] you until When God says I've called you
[2:31:28] to do this you will say God who me who
[2:31:32] am I I am but a man I have no ability I
[2:31:38] have no ability you mean me God says yes
[2:31:42] you
[2:31:45] you certain times when God shows me what
[2:31:50] he called me to
[2:31:52] accomplish I
[2:31:54] Marvel if I tell you all the things that
[2:31:57] God told me I will accomplish in this
[2:31:59] life in his service you will think I'm
[2:32:04] crazy but let me tell you each of us
[2:32:07] should come at that
[2:32:09] place where you
[2:32:12] realize what you are called to
[2:32:17] accomplish when you see it you won't
[2:32:20] believe it mes saw it said God who am me
[2:32:27] me go to
[2:32:29] PHA tell him let my people
[2:32:33] go who am
[2:32:36] I I'm nothing I'm about just a man what
[2:32:41] can I accomplish on my
[2:32:43] own do you see the difference now
[2:32:46] between the first Moses and the second
[2:32:48] Moses
[2:32:51] Exodus 41 and Moses answered and
[2:32:54] said but behold they will not believe
[2:33:00] me no hecken unto my
[2:33:03] voice for they will say the Lord has not
[2:33:07] appeared
[2:33:08] unto at another place he said oh God I
[2:33:16] st how will I speak
[2:33:20] when God calls
[2:33:21] you he knows you will accomplish that
[2:33:23] Divine
[2:33:26] assignment but God cannot call
[2:33:30] you until you are
[2:33:32] ready and you are not
[2:33:35] ready until you think you are not
[2:33:39] ready am I preaching to someone here
[2:33:41] this
[2:33:42] morning you are not ready until you
[2:33:44] think you are not ready
[2:33:50] if you feel you are ready you are not
[2:33:53] ready if you feel you can do it you are
[2:33:56] not ready if you want to go you are not
[2:34:00] ready but until you come to that place
[2:34:03] where you feel you are not ready then
[2:34:05] you are ready to
[2:34:07] go amen some of you are fearing marriage
[2:34:12] because you feel you are not ready I
[2:34:14] tell you then you are
[2:34:16] ready then you are ready if you feel you
[2:34:19] not worthy then you are worthy if you
[2:34:22] feel you can't serve God then you are
[2:34:25] ready if you feel you can't go then you
[2:34:28] can why because God has a way of turning
[2:34:34] weakness perfect weakness into perfect
[2:34:39] strength amen if you see every man of
[2:34:43] God that has been used by God they will
[2:34:47] tell you I never knew that God would do
[2:34:51] this like they were surprised by
[2:34:56] God hallelujah hallelujah and some of
[2:35:00] you are are even saying I can't worship
[2:35:02] God because I'm a sinner then you are
[2:35:05] ready to worship
[2:35:07] God the moment you feel so
[2:35:09] holy you can never worship God but when
[2:35:13] you are
[2:35:14] broken when you feel sinful when you
[2:35:17] feel insufficient when you feel
[2:35:21] and you are ready to
[2:35:23] worship because when you worship it will
[2:35:26] be from your heart when you are
[2:35:29] weak when you feel not
[2:35:31] loved that's the moment to
[2:35:34] worship that woman she was a prostitute
[2:35:38] when she came to Jesus she was
[2:35:42] broken she was broken she just fell down
[2:35:46] and you know everything was automatic
[2:35:48] and natural
[2:35:51] and her tears came down and she was
[2:35:54] crying why because she was
[2:35:58] broken because she knew she was not
[2:36:01] worthy brother listen sister listen when
[2:36:04] you are not worthy then you are ready to
[2:36:08] worship when you are weak then you are
[2:36:11] ready to be used by God because God
[2:36:15] wants to use useless
[2:36:17] things he wants to use useless
[2:36:21] things so that he can
[2:36:23] prove that he can never share his
[2:36:26] glory with no
[2:36:29] man amen and then he comes in our
[2:36:34] generation and he picks a man called
[2:36:37] William
[2:36:38] BR a man who had no
[2:36:41] education a man who didn't know how to
[2:36:43] speak English a man whose family was
[2:36:47] broken his parents were making out
[2:36:51] he was from a family that didn't even
[2:36:53] know God why did God do
[2:36:56] that just at an very early age of seven
[2:37:01] years he comes and speaks to him and he
[2:37:04] says never drink never def your body in
[2:37:08] any way because I have a work for you
[2:37:11] when you get older why God do that why
[2:37:15] did he pick somebody who was a nobody
[2:37:18] because God wanted to prove he can turn
[2:37:22] somebody in nobody into
[2:37:25] somebody God wanted to prove a point it
[2:37:29] is not about
[2:37:30] this it's about the
[2:37:33] go so when you see anything good in
[2:37:37] me I can announce to you this morning
[2:37:40] it's not because I am good it's not
[2:37:42] because I'm
[2:37:43] educated because God has made me what I
[2:37:48] am I am but a man God has made me who I
[2:37:52] am and that that is what he wants to
[2:37:54] make
[2:37:56] you stop feeling sorry about
[2:37:58] yourself and you fail to serve
[2:38:01] God you fail to serve
[2:38:03] God because you say you a bad
[2:38:07] story God wants bad
[2:38:11] stories God wants those ones who are
[2:38:14] really
[2:38:16] weak God is looking for
[2:38:20] nobody God is looking for somebody who
[2:38:24] can achieve
[2:38:27] nothing I don't know if I have some in
[2:38:29] the
[2:38:30] church don't worry if you have something
[2:38:35] if you feel you something this service
[2:38:38] is not for you this service is for

[2:40:48] qualified for a job who are not
[2:40:51] qualified for marriage who are not

[2:41:26] years
[2:41:27] sister 40
[2:41:30] years why he waited for the first year
[2:41:34] mother still F
[2:41:36] qualified second year 10 years Moses was
[2:41:40] still feeling

[2:41:52] Ethiopian girl he mares her God Is
[2:41:56] Watching God is saying you still have
[2:42:00] qualifications but I have to take
[2:42:04] out all the qualifications from you that
[2:42:08] the world has given you so I can make
[2:42:11] you so I can make you something that the
[2:42:16] world can never make you
[2:42:20] attack attacking
[2:42:22] Egypt at the time was like attacking
[2:42:26] America I want you to imagine you are
[2:42:29] little
[2:42:31] nobody going to invade
[2:42:34] America who does that it is
[2:42:37] impossible but now if God can send an
[2:42:41] unqualified man to invade a country how
[2:42:45] much more small things like a job off
[2:42:50] like a desire for
[2:42:52] marriage like a desire to serve God to
[2:42:55] have the Holy Ghost this small small
[2:42:58] thing God is more than
[2:43:01] [Applause]
[2:43:03] able we as
[2:43:06] dvf are not
[2:43:08] qualified to even have a land of our own
[2:43:11] because we are so few just a little over
[2:43:15] 100 people no money no money in in big
[2:43:20] tits no in big
[2:43:22] offerings we are not like other churches
[2:43:25] that are financially
[2:43:28] qualified but I tell you what God if it
[2:43:32] is time to
[2:43:34] move Sister Mary he can give us
[2:43:38] land without us even paying a
[2:43:43] shing you can call me
[2:43:46] fool but I'm just being inspired
[2:43:49] to speak by inspiration and to tell you
[2:43:53] even for a little
[2:43:55] church Someone told
[2:43:58] me don't you see you are putting
[2:43:59] yourself High get
[2:44:02] some which is like million and use the
[2:44:06] balance to BU still young poor they
[2:44:09] don't understand
[2:44:12] how when God gives a vision the vision
[2:44:16] is bigger than you
[2:44:19] see beyond what they see you see what
[2:44:22] God
[2:44:22] sees a little old
[2:44:26] Moses this time he was
[2:44:28] old he he was a Shepherd a Shepherd is
[2:44:33] the least of the jobs anyone can
[2:44:37] do meaning he had accepted to set
[2:44:45] for
[2:44:47] faes was in that Lev
[2:44:50] fa because they
[2:44:52] fa go with what comes God came at that
[2:44:56] moment now I do not know brother sister
[2:45:00] how many are here and you at that stage
[2:45:03] when you are saying
[2:45:07] amen that moment God is
[2:45:11] swifting fixing to come and when he
[2:45:14] comes he comes
[2:45:17] swiftly is is movement is faster than
[2:45:21] sound amen he came all the way from
[2:45:24] Heaven amen and he overtook
[2:45:28] Moses and he went ahead of him and he
[2:45:31] came in a a Bush Moses who was on Earth
[2:45:35] walking he found a burning
[2:45:38] bush God saw
[2:45:42] Moses when before he was
[2:45:47] born and he he waited for that
[2:45:51] moment when Moses felt
[2:45:54] weak stupid
[2:45:57] useless finished then God said it is
[2:46:00] time for
[2:46:02] me Moses was
[2:46:04] poor mother was poor
[2:46:09] brother God said it is time to move how
[2:46:14] many years 40 years it doesn't matter
[2:46:18] how long
[2:46:19] that
[2:46:20] moment when it is
[2:46:24] impossible then God wants to
[2:46:27] prove it's time to
[2:46:32] move and he came in a burning
[2:46:35] bush and they called
[2:46:38] Moses what's that mes what's
[2:46:42] that you know when he calls you you
[2:46:45] can't even believe it why you not
[2:46:55] qualified because you're not
[2:46:58] qualif you feel
[2:47:00] useless but it doesn't matter whether
[2:47:02] you feel
[2:47:04] useless it doesn't
[2:47:07] matter if God qualifies
[2:47:09] me cany
[2:47:12] you can qualify every one of
[2:47:15] us hallelujah amen and when God
[2:47:20] no one can
[2:47:23] unify and Moses at that moment he did
[2:47:26] not know he was meeting a living
[2:47:29] God friends do we
[2:47:31] believe that God is still living
[2:47:36] to or are we just having church still
[2:47:38] living
[2:47:40] God qualifies the
[2:47:43] unqualified and then he takes them on
[2:47:45] the next
[2:47:46] phase and that next phase
[2:47:49] is not a face of
[2:47:52] feess is not a pH of un
[2:47:55] qualification a of
[2:47:59] power amen
[2:48:01] amen when Moses went to
[2:48:05] Egypt he did not go as a weak
[2:48:09] man he went with us the
[2:48:13] Lord he was like a
[2:48:16] boy jumping up and down
[2:48:19] jumping up and down fearing no
[2:48:23] man
[2:48:25] Fearless when you know you are called by
[2:48:27] God you become
[2:48:30] Fearless brother that job that you
[2:48:33] want that job that you want you can
[2:48:37] receive fearlessly when you hear the
[2:48:40] calling of
[2:48:41] God it's not man to qualify you for the
[2:48:46] job amen others who have
[2:48:50] qualifications and they don't have good
[2:48:54] jobs God can
[2:48:59] qualify I don't know whether I'm
[2:49:00] preaching to someone here
[2:49:05] today when you feel no one will believe
[2:49:07] you when you feel no one will listen to
[2:49:10] you when you feel that you know no one
[2:49:12] will understand you like Moses felt amen
[2:49:17] he felt that he was just a person human
[2:49:19] being and
[2:49:23] nobody and that's why even here later on
[2:49:27] he was very busy crying when people when
[2:49:30] God brought him into this position of
[2:49:32] power and then he he felt that people
[2:49:35] were asking for too
[2:49:38] much you know you have you feel you have
[2:49:40] a lot of
[2:49:42] responsibility on your shoulders but you
[2:49:45] do not have
[2:49:46] ability to fulfill those resp
[2:49:49] responsibilities and um he started
[2:49:51] crying out he
[2:49:54] wept with all you know he had as people
[2:49:58] were crying
[2:49:59] out every man in his
[2:50:02] house and the Ang of the Lord was kind
[2:50:05] of and was also
[2:50:08] displeased yes even in the middle of
[2:50:11] your
[2:50:13] calling you can be displeased sometimes
[2:50:18] because you do not
[2:50:21] understand how this job you
[2:50:24] received when you were
[2:50:26] unqualified you cannot be able to
[2:50:29] accomplish we don't always have all the
[2:50:32] answers but the only thing we did is we
[2:50:34] answer the
[2:50:37] call and we took the job
[2:50:40] offer and Moses is very busy
[2:50:44] working and then the people begin
[2:50:46] crying and he was displeased
[2:50:49] and he said to the Lord why have you
[2:50:51] Afflicted
[2:50:53] your why why have you put all the burden
[2:50:57] of these people
[2:51:00] on did I conceive all these
[2:51:03] people did I beget them that that you
[2:51:07] should tell me
[2:51:11] all i n them as a a father B A suing
[2:51:17] child no no no no cannot do this he he
[2:51:20] was
[2:51:21] displeased he said I am not able to Bear
[2:51:24] all these people
[2:51:27] alone because meat is heavy for me and
[2:51:30] if thou deal th with me then kill
[2:51:36] me but here is some consolation for
[2:51:40] you if God calls
[2:51:42] you he will help
[2:51:44] you God tolds you he will give help
[2:51:49] when you need
[2:51:50] help when things are heavy for you if
[2:51:53] it's a calling of
[2:51:55] God he somehow brings
[2:51:57] help then he tells Moses okay Moses when
[2:52:02] God came down you know
[2:52:20] because he is
[2:52:23] God he does not share his glory any
[2:52:27] [Applause]

[2:52:31] becomes he has the answer hallelujah

[2:52:39] do to do in my
[2:52:41] situation he knowes what to do in your
[2:52:44] situation you don't need to lose hope
