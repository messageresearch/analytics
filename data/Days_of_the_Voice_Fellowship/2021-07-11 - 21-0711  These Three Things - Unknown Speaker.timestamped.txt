[1:08:50] if you do not want to overcome
[1:08:55] you can never be a christian
[1:08:59] when we say a believer it
[1:09:02] means you believe
[1:09:33] also overcame somehow
[1:09:39] but she did not yield it now but she was
[1:09:42] a believer anyhow

[1:10:11] and when you face those personal
[1:10:13] temptations you must overcome them
[1:10:20] if you cannot overcome them
[1:10:24] then you are failed
[1:10:28] and
[1:10:40] to fight and overcome
[1:10:55] jesus was god in flesh
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:00] if god in flesh if god manifested in
[1:11:02] flesh
[1:11:03] could not overcome by his uh
[1:11:06] by his own strength
[1:11:24] strength you have
[1:11:28] to overcome by the word
[1:11:33] jesus overcame by the word
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:38] and by the
[1:11:50] are you following me in each of the
[1:11:54] three major trials
[1:11:57] that correspondent
[1:11:59] [Applause]
[1:12:01] exactly to the temptations of the garden
[1:12:04] of eden
[1:12:06] it says okay he says in each of these of
[1:12:09] the three major trials that corresponded
[1:12:11] exactly to the temptation
[1:12:12] of the garden of heaven
[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:17] the last of the flesh
[1:12:20] the last of the eye and the pride of
[1:12:24] life
[1:12:26] jesus overcame by the word
[1:12:31] eve fell to the personal temptation of
[1:12:34] saturn
[1:12:36] [Applause]
[1:12:40] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:12:44] he says eve fell to the personal
[1:12:48] temptation of saturn
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:52] by failing to use the word
[1:12:58] failing to use the word
[1:13:11] disobedience to the word
[1:13:26] but jesus overcame by the word
[1:13:35] and right now let me say this
[1:13:40] this is the only way to be an overcomer
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:14:12] so so if eva
[1:14:15] failed to use the word
[1:14:21] she had the word but she tried to use
[1:14:25] the word
[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:40] that very
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:50] of this generation told us to do
[1:15:08] scripture three
[1:15:11] to never misplace scripture
[1:15:15] come on now so when you when you
[1:15:18] dislocate the word
[1:15:21] when you misapply it
[1:15:25] how you misplace it
[1:15:31] so when you do those three things you
[1:15:34] have already failed before you start
[1:16:32] scripture but when jesus came
[1:16:35] yes they did not
[1:16:38] apply the scripture in the right way
[1:16:44] he must build up
[1:16:54] [Applause]
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:42] many denominations which have the same
[1:17:44] right that we have to you know
[1:17:48] read the same scriptures
[1:17:52] but they cannot apply those scriptures
[1:17:55] in the right occasions
[1:18:23] praise the name of the lord
[1:19:03] as much as i might be preaching but i'm
[1:19:05] really teaching something here
[1:19:34] by
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:44] is
[1:20:59] in evolution between a group winner and
[1:21:01] that group is
[1:21:02] like adam for them
[1:21:07] but they they refuse to obey never gone
[1:21:10] oh yeah i know that's what
[1:21:39] it is hallelujah amen
[1:21:42] did adam die adam here yes yes
[1:21:46] and what is this oppressive death means
[1:21:49] a total separation from god
[1:22:36] now we can sing jesus
[1:22:39] jesus overcame yeshua jesus overcame
[1:22:43] satan's power
[1:22:48] jesus overcame yes jesus
[1:23:04] you can overcome amen amen you too can
[1:23:07] overcome by the word
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:10] god has given us the word in this last
[1:23:12] days
[1:23:14] and we too can overcome
[1:23:18] hallelujah
[1:23:28] i want you to see this temptation of
[1:23:32] jesus
[1:23:46] then was jesus led up of the spirit into
[1:23:49] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:23:51] devil
[1:23:51] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[1:23:54] nights
[1:23:55] he was afterward unhanged
[1:23:58] [Music]
[1:23:59] and when the tempter came to him he said
[1:24:02] if thou be the son of god
[1:24:03] command that these stones be made bread
[1:24:06] but he answered written man shall not
[1:24:09] live by bread alone
[1:24:11] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:24:13] the mouth
[1:24:14] of god
[1:24:16] [Music]
[1:24:46] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:24:50] now i want us to examine the temptations
[1:24:54] of jesus in matthew chapter four
[1:25:09] but the bible says to be tempted of the
[1:25:10] devil
[1:25:15] and when he had fasted
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:24] he
[1:25:28] and the prophet said that we as
[1:25:30] believers
[1:25:32] when you fast
[1:25:36] you must be led into a fast
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:26:21] you are in your heart you are yielding
[1:26:23] yourself
[1:26:26] on youtube you don't even become hungry
[1:26:32] because you are fasting
[1:27:03] after the burden has been lifted
[1:27:10] many times even believers when they get
[1:27:12] problems they don't fast
[1:27:17] when was the last time that you fasted
[1:27:19] was somebody else
[1:27:21] but you you may tell me one year
[1:27:25] within that one year you've never had a
[1:27:30] problem
[1:27:45] fasting and prayer when certain
[1:27:47] situations come to our life
[1:27:54] many times when the lord puts the fast
[1:27:56] on you just blush it off because you're
[1:27:57] so busy and you're so
[1:27:59] caught up with your day-to-day lives
[1:28:12] always yield when he puts a fast on us
[1:28:15] we must always
[1:28:16] yield to it
[1:28:21] to hear from him you must be willing to
[1:28:25] yield to him
[1:28:40] [Music]
[1:28:54] before
[1:29:05] [Applause]
[1:29:08] we don't usually mean the uh last
[1:29:11] sexual kind of immorality
[1:29:34] you know the last of the flesh is not
[1:29:35] merely the last of after
[1:29:49] the last of the flesh
[1:29:52] the last after the flesh like the flesh
[1:29:54] lasting
[1:29:56] for suck for for for you know for
[1:29:57] fornication for this and that
[1:30:00] but you know it it entails all the lust
[1:30:03] that has its seat
[1:30:18] me james chapter 1
[1:30:24] james chapter 1 verse 13.
[1:30:27] we can begin from verse 12 blessed is
[1:30:30] the man that endureth
[1:30:31] temptation for when he is tried he shall
[1:30:34] receive the crown of life
[1:30:36] which the lord has promised to them that
[1:30:39] love him
[1:30:42] come on now let no man say when he is
[1:30:45] tempted i am tempted of god for god
[1:30:48] cannot be tempted with evil
[1:30:50] neither tempteth he any man now
[1:30:54] here on verse 12 he says blessed is the
[1:30:56] man that endures temptation
[1:30:57] if temptation comes to you and you
[1:30:59] endure it in other words you overcome
[1:31:01] it for when you are tried you will
[1:31:03] receive after you have tried and you
[1:31:05] overcome

[1:31:08] will receive the crown
[1:31:09] of life which the lord has promised to
[1:31:11] them that love him

[1:32:07] temptation you are tempted
[1:32:10] with it's the source of it is the last
