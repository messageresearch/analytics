even as she's here [Music] I mean [Music] amen before you get seated please open your Bibles with me let us go to the book of Hebrews chapter 11. musicians Hebrews name and we are really just reading one verse together [Music] are you are you there yet if you're there just say Amen what does all right so we read together verse six we can begin from verse 5. by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had transited him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God is a which we shall really dwell on but for now let us ask God to bless his one and then you'll be seated father we commit this word into your hands that we have read these people into your hands as well just give me the grace Lord to speak to them that the word will penetrate their hearts direct my thoughts and everything Lord and give us a good atmosphere that your holy spirit will be pleased with us this morning Father we ask this blessing in Jesus name praise the Lord now I'd like to bring greetings to you in the name of Jesus Christ this morning when you greet your neighbor and tell them God bless you so uh this morning um I'm happy that you prayed for me and I'm back safely the ones who prayed for me I want to say God bless you God answered your prayers that I'm back when I'm well amen and not only that but also God gave us wonderful a wonderful time in Germany we really had a uh it was a supernatural weekend for me um you know in the meetings there we had a lot of Believers and ministers and people coming in from different countries the meetings were hosted by the pastor in Germany brother God Road who has been in the message for quite very many years maybe almost 50 now um and so uh we had the ministers and Saints from Belgium Italy England Germany Russia Poland Ukraine Ukraine notice you were in a meeting in one in one of the services we had a prayer line and one of the pastors that was with us on the prayer line um was a pastor Sagi from Russia Moscow and some believers who are coming to be prayed for we are from Ukraine and you know in Ukraine and Russia they speak the same language and so these people could not be able to express themselves in in Germany or in English had to interpret for brother Timothy and the rest of us uh um for these people from in Russian or stroke Ukrainian to to to English and you those of us who know what is happening in Russia and Ukraine you're like that is impossible but that's confirmed to me in the believer's world we are completely in another world we are living in the world but we are not of the world no matter what is going on in the politics of the regions or the politics of the world the believer is not really that much affected because what affects us is what is in our world I'm glad to be a part of this world there was war in Ukraine praying for ukrainians that have been maybe lost their families or lost things or lost and he's praying for them and comforting them in the Lord that means that we are citizens I was really glad to see that I understand with this man of God in on the battlefronto and uh I by God's grace we we had most of the services uh uh on the weekend preached by brother Tim and brother Timothy orange and brother God asked me to preach the first service on I think it was on a Friday and uh we agree that it will be the appetizer for the services but I was really humbled I mean there were many many ministers who would have stood chance God gave us Grace I know that some of you streamed that service and those who did not get a chance because you know in Germany they are not like in the U.S or other capitalist countries to even access the service because it was you have to sign in on our website to access it I said brother God I said brother God would it be okay for me to stream uh the weekend of these meetings on our Channel on YouTube kids I asked about that uh brother Isaac is going to be putting it up I think the first one is when sorry 9 pm today and I think that will be the service I preached basically I was giving my testimony and gave a little exportation and then uh the rest of the meetings will also follow I think we'll announce to you when or you just keep checking on the channel it will be uploaded there and then you can be able to stream it and share it with others it was a blessing and so I also had a wonderful time you know brother Tim brother Tim Pruitt what kind of team prude is a man that has preached this message for more than 50 years and if I've seen ministers that are balanced in the world but the team fruit is really one of them and I really uh love the way he delivers the word and God has prospered his ministry over the years and ever since brother Eddie biscal invited him in one of his meetings in Canada 2007. stream into one of those meetings it was an immense blessing to me so I've been following that brother's Ministry and so we had time in Fellowship you know speaking of about the ministry and you know like I I can say that he was imparting on me all the years of his ministry and I really felt it was a big blessing for me from here in Uganda and basically in Africa that go to Europe or to America to to receive a money impartation and I was really very embarrassed as they were telling me of some of these names of people from here keep writing letters what I told these brothers I said Luke brothers because I understand that this came in from a long history Uganda and I really need to tell you this wanted to come to you guys but he failed to come because of War now and at the time you know Uganda was kind of uh broken into many pieces people did not have clothes people did not have food they didn't even have time to cultivate them and so they wouldn't have education schools no Healthcare Systems we were broken down because of you know it was like a war-ton country in Colorado some of the brothers that came here those many years ago and so all they could do was to support give money support give money for everything you know they have to come and preach meetings they have to rent a building like this so they have to pay cutting the we might not have attained what they have attained but we are no longer where Uganda was 30 40 years ago I spoke to the Brethren and I told them this is another generation we are in another generation and I told them I mean like I knew but I've known brother God for very many years and they said to him I mean like I've never written you to ask for any money but I had needs everybody whether they are white or black but we need to have a realization that the god of the whites is when they followed his words and so I clearly put it to the Brethren together them if there is anything I've come for here once you invited me do I desire to come because but the team put was going to be in this meeting take part in them because I was really immensely blessed and we had a good a real good time in discussing about the ministry and about you know the work of the Lord and his experience over there we also pray together with him it was a really wonderful time and so we met also quite a several friends some of which are are going to come and visit us [Music] from Russia I said if you came to Uganda you will be the first preacher from Russia how many would like to see him you would say well this message is from American is a Russian and a Russian America you know oh how come let me tell you this message is not American message this message is from the mind of God and so there's a lot that we can talk about the trip but I think I will not take more time I want us to just go right into the world but I want to appreciate the ministers Brother Martin brother uh Joel and the other musicians and the brothers that have really stood a club I've heard that you've had wonderful meetings this morning I just want to continue you remember the last time I left I was going to speak on the power of Revelation part 2. so I ended up speaking on on it but I did not go into the what I wanted to go into so I'll this is like part three but it will really be the second part of that service so please go back to the Village Hebrews 11. [Music] um we'll begin from verses one so we can be able to see the whole thing [Music] now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not sinus for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear again by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Caine by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet is that a man by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had he had this testimony that he pleased so you see Hebrews 11 News goes on and on and on and on again he speaks us of so many and he says that they pleased God by faith and you know he spoke of Abel okay he spoke he spoke of Abraham actually very many and he continued stressing the point it was by Faith by faith people like Daniel in the land can you imagine an offering David is a natural way why you cannot give to God an offering and God accepts it if it is not by faith it must be by faith if it is impossible to please God every one of us let us read verses six together one two three go but without faith but without faith let us do it again maybe you are not there yet let us do it again now the Pentecostals have taught us faith and some of them have described Faith something that you do you work no I believe it is going to be I I I accept it I see it is so what is faith faith the Bible says the substance call your neighbors faith is a substance is a substance it is something that you have a naturally yet you are going to attain it is all under one umbrella with your navigation when he said what is faith in the message the anointed ones at the end times faith is something that is revealed to you five is something that is revealed to you praise the name of the Lord come here let me tell you something can be open but we're not revealed and the book is an open book the book is full of promises full of you know what God has promised his children the book is showing us what we are going to be in the bed the book is demonstrating what a child of God now everything in that open books because God has said it is not good to you foreign [Music] does God want me to do that quality how can I attain this you know how can I attain that how can I find a wife how can I find a business profitable how can I know good to associate how can I know this is why I'm supposed to be how can I know is my pastor how can I know you're supposed to be a part of the other team how can I know let me tell you brothers and faith cannot be shared all cookies it is something that is revealed to you people when some something is revealed to you could be people will try to talk you out of it they will try to make you as a fail as if you were a failure oh but because you have faith because job Revelations faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation tell your neighbor faith is a revelation if your neighbor is if you tell somebody come on it is a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it is given to you by the grace of God hallelujah amen and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the Revelation and how does faith foreign why do we come to church why do we Fellowship every time why do we every time should we hear the words the reason is simple without faith does not please God thank you we need that faith comes by here in the world pray is the name of the Lord and this morning I'm going to show you very many people here three or four people as examples to us this morning and then you will see the power of Revelation and when God gave me this inspiration I've left it at home by inspiration when something is revealed to him it is time for it to happen amen hallelujah amen Hallelujah that moment it is um I will read from the message out from the message uh wax is no no no just a moment I'll get the message I want to read from uh wax is Faith expressed yes I wanted to listen to this word amen Amina and as I'm preaching to you maybe some of you will receive face because that moment something is about one way before I talk about David no man had no Revelation came all the way from where he came from to come in Israel and when he arrived there the reason why he came was because he had there was a prophet of God in Israel the reason why you have come it's because you know in this place is sent out to you when you hear that message without faith they know nothing will happen to you without revelation Ghana which will change I need let me let me tell you the gospel engineering is not the only word she became of your car the gospel Gamble and action words and life praise the name of the Lord Jesus did not just preach yesterday but he also opened the eyes of the blind he also made the lamb to work so the gospel Angel is not only word she became of your career not to be educated people we are not to be educated only if we are only educated message Believers we have the mechanics but we have no Dynamics which we are preaching to you Allah is much has the potentially that's the power let me tell you the world is powerful the Bible says you need to have faith you need to have Revelations you can choose to go back to Urban and fever or go and die with your lips God doesn't change his words stop if you want to go to work do what he's watching this is what is not debatable difference between the message Believers and the denominations now here comes a man who begins to debate with the prophet and the prophet said what I say change is it wasn't even written sometimes you can come in the church and a preacher speak to you directly tell you something just there he's just excited nothing will happen nothing will happen if you receive a revelation that is and then maybe he speaks to you in the ministers [Applause] Hallelujah something was revealed to us she she you know she was like this is true and when she [Music] is the prophet of God also received another evidence and he spoke into her life said if she had asked for a million dollars but she asked for the Salvation and God saved all of them you have to have the right attitude I love it Revelation is by inspiration she came to him and she said foreign you see the impossibility Faith okay is a matter of the heart and that moment I was like okay what is that thing that made him to bow down and that's the only thing that pleases because when you have faitha foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] we prayed for Sunshine and you are coming with all the jackets because it has been raining for the past few months dressed as somebody who is going to have Sunshine then it is he says now some of them said I know you are naughty his mother said you come up here to see the battle now you get on you get on back over where the them ship was and he said let me speak to Saul General I admire your courage you are nothing but you are nothing but a youth and he's a Warrior from his youths for him but he said I was standing my father's ship yes oh it's just the same he has to reveal to you yes foreign [Music] to me foreign that was Revelation he did it we can be some David there can be some David's here how about I'm happy to say God bless you what can't Our God do now ask your neighbor what can't God do maybe something is [Music] am I the only one asking my neighbors think about that for a moment [Music] saw me before he was born information [Music] he is alive today as he was there amen and if he has blessed others if he has blessed us with the wives I've often heard many young people saying and I really feel sorry for this generation because without faith you are you're going to perish you have to have faith how dare you say that well that was then no more Good Guys the reason why they are more No Good Girls is because they are no more good boys and if you want a good guy God can give you a good god a God-fearing God that loves God a God that will amen make your joyful um if God Did It for the others are you saying you were the first one on earth to desire to marry a Godly woman are you the first one brother Marvin I'm sorry you're not the first one foreign and we understand it is foreign I'm going to be excited singing songs foreign it's a revelation of marriage looking for somebody to get married and somebody who wrote I'll marry when I want let me tell you let me tell you everything to a child of God is a revelation foreign I want to marry at 20. I mean there was no way it was going to happen was in school no livelihood just a mother and a sister who also wear needs the only man in the house you need to take care of them he said this is what I want I want to marry a 20. the young man it is a revelation we have people who have a lot of Ahmed a lot of wealth job with the millionaires but they still have it married they're just moving around from woman to woman with some women read the thought of just getting married and sticking with one woman and paying you know bright price and doing a wedding oh it's like okay it is a Dreadful thing for them because you see they have no Revelations how can they receive Revelations because it leader stuck your mind the Bible says casting down imagination [Applause] I've seen people but they are mean some of them are the meanest creatures give me a little gracious in churches around me in the message that inclusive why do many people suffer financially and they told me something that I said that is right he said in his church he has had a lot of people sometimes they are they're suffering financially and they would come to him and say Pastor um that you will not even have enough blessings to keep it I mean it's a scripture it's in the Bible that every believer he believes that must be a taith ten percent of your income is not yours it is and I've also been because of that I've also normalized blessings foreign foreign [Music] foreign foreign specifically what I saw was from Malawi videos you know people who almost to drugs people who need you know like they need food yo foreign we are looking for money to buy land do not understand but your hand is in your pockets we are collecting please foreign [Music] I think we as the days of the voice Fellowship can be an example if we choose to be days of The Voice Even in our young age it's never too late for God to fulfill his word [Applause] let me let me let me give you another example of Samsung quote out one day of God in aprily and here come a thousand citizens upon him and he looked down on the ground and there is where a mule had died as it could be and they took it on it and took out after those Philistines not the truth foreign [Music] I want to ask you today what is your job this man was a man of God this man was anointed this man was called this man was placed there but there's something that he heard that they did not have [Music] but what did he have yeah and that Revelation amen Drew him to pick whatever he foreign foreign tacos in the camp why do everyone because of one man with Revelations imagine if you're fighting on a battlefronto he's killing on the front in the back on the side and on the left two three four one it must have been some exercise for him my mother is strength it was the power of Revelation what do we have let me tell you when you receive revelation God begins to work with you using whatever you are crazy it might be small that's what you need to begin Hallelujah [Applause] foreign [Music] ten thousand every month why not 100. but make sure you commit yourself I'm going to kill this Philistines right now we are giving all our money to somebody else and I'm really I know most of your members I'm offroading my heart to you we're giving all our money to somebody who's using you to Father his vision but we have our vision some of you have children already others are going to have children where do you want your children to go you want them to to go in a place where it's not like a sanctuary I think parents who are here you'd rather do all your characters [Music] not only for the church for now we're talking about the house so we can have our own topics it is foreign I want to tell you something now work on that pulsation look on that partition a pulsation no you're really missing it praise the name of the Lord is like a sensation okay foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and then you get an excitement in your heart that Spa that's part of a moment I'm going to give you one of my spouse of a moment was very hard for me to hold on to it I was in university and I was um I think I was doing I was trying to pursue a degree in it and it was uh sometime I'd study for some time and then you know as I had gone to Zimbabwe so cold in my life I received when I came back I received that power when I spoke to my mother I spoke to her and said there's something I feel today I just want to drop out of the school right and I want to first concentrate on getting married raising a family and then uh we will see school later but I want to be considered on Ministry and family and she opened our eyes I will lay you down and beat you but I was little but that was a spa of a moment brother Timothy said something in the meetings over there he said the presence of God is Not emotional give me your religions they said where [Music] don't quench the spirit tonight in this and you know he was driving almost toward him stop because you see that was such a presence you know drugs they call it they call it you know doing those that kind of thing I don't know how they call it you know those people they go do it and you know like Voodoo People and other people you know they go they say well you listen to the inner man and you try how do they call that foreign same foreign I know some people have been streaming our services well I
