Oh Lord, just come Lord and sweep Lord that everyone will see your presence. Oh father, oh Lord loving Jesus, this is a divine gathering of father because you said Lord in your word where two or three are gathered. You'll be a minister Lord as we're going to open the scriptures. May you make it life for Lord to us. May you make it light Lord. May you make it an anchor Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord when the winds come Lord may it be the anchor that we are going to come. Many Lord may may be having a lot of wind storms in their lives now Lord. But Lord, like you you you you woke up Lord Jesus in the boat and you had [music] to come the storms farther. May you just come down Lord. Lord Jesus be my help this evening. Be the help of your children this evening. [music] Lord we are only relying on you. We are not relying on man or God but we are relying on you Lord. Oh Jesus you welcome this we pray through your might name Jesus. Amen. God bless you once again. Thank the Lord who has enabled us to be here. I always don't like taking it for granted when uh we come to the house of the Lord because I because I believe he's here. That's why I really take it so personal and I just pray that you may take it personal. This is we shall just open the scriptures. Proverbs 25 verse 25. Proverbs chapter 25 verse 2 it says it is the glory of God to conceal a thing but the honor of the kings is to search out a matter. The heaven for for height and the earth for depth and the heart of kings is an is unarchable. Take away the drawers from the silver. And there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. Take away the wicked from before the king. And his throne shall be established in righteousness. May the word of the Lord be blessed. You can have your seats. So this evening I just have a a simple inspiration that the Lord has put on my heart. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just want us to be connected in one one accord that we may hear what the Lord is trying to tell us this evening. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. As you're seated there, keep praying that God may answer you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My simple inspiration is rise and shine. Rise and shine. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word of God defines us to be the kings that are chosen are peculiar people. You are peculiar people. Never and never despise yourself. uh when you read when you go through this scripture that you have read the second verse it says it is the glory of God to conceal a thing that the honor of kings is to search out a matter how many have heard that it is the it is the honor of kings The Lord has made us kings and priests. It is our duty to search out a matter but God has concealed it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He has hidden it but we have to search them out. We as the kings under that inspiration of rise and shine. I have an an other inspiration that is attached to it. Ignited by the living word. Ignited by the living word. I just want to tell you this evening But the word of God is very true for you to trust it. These are not just words that man sat down and wrote down the word of God. When we read it, search out a matter what God is trying to tell you. THIS EVENING WE ARE READING THIS word search out a matter then rise and shine. The devil may have tried to deceive because the greatest gateway of the devil is lying. IF HE LIES YOU and brings fear in your heart, you'll not rise and shine. Hallelujah. you not rise and shine. This evening, [laughter] I just want you to take this. The living word of God is true and it never fails. Hallelujah. I will not say that I'm an angel that we do not get uh some disturbances in life that we do not get down sometimes. Yeah, we get down. everyone even the prophet he wanted to kill himself he went up he said let this electricity just kill me sometimes you reach those moments and you say why CAN'T I JUST LEAVE WHY can't I just leave THIS MESSAGE WHY AM I frustrating myself but this evening I want to tell you just get ignited by THE LIVING WORD WHATEVER THE WORD HAS SAY, just believe it and go forward with it. When when things get rough, you also have to get rough. That's why when someone is driving a car, he reaches a muddy place, you put fourwheel. Hallelujah. I just want you TO PUT A FOUR WHEEL THIS EVENING. Things will not always be just walking. I want you to put now a for a for gear whatever but I think you have understood it. I just want you to put another gear in your life, in your faith, in the trust that you put in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. And say, what does God want me to do? What has God put in this trouble my life? What has the Lord put in this message that I'm here? What? What? What am I? What am I here to do? Am I just Am I just going to live and die? No. Search out a matter in everything. Search out a matter. When you get the matter in the whatever you're searching, then rise and shine and reflect to that. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just have to rise and shine and identify yourself with what you have searched. It is like a student when you study. Yeah. You'll be you'll be proud of yourself that I know this. I know this. You can even stand before people and explain. Hallelujah. So I want you to like search out a matter in this situation that you may be in. There's no situation that God brings along your way that brings to distract you. It is either you you are not IN YOUR POSITION THERE'S SOMETHING THE LORD WANTS you to learn. So what what is the matter? The main goal is the Lord has something better for you in that situation. We cast him out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We see Job, &gt;&gt; he got sicknesses, but the Lord had permitted it. &gt;&gt; He had permitted it. &gt;&gt; But the truth is, reality is hard to eat Job. Realities had to hit Job. He complained a little bit, but when he heard the word of God that Elu preached to him, God united and he went back to his feet and he had to shine again. I WANT YOU TO SHINE AGAIN. I want you to rise and shine again. Tell the devil, "You're too late. WHATEVER YOUR HALLELUJAH, this battle was already won. It's just you searching out a matter in that battle. They fought for me." Like you have to search out a matter of the battle that the Lord fought for you. and say the devil, the Lord fought for me. HE PAID &gt;&gt; FOR EVERYTHING. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And rise and shine. He will not dare put a hand on you. He will not dare put a hand on you. The devil will say, "You got me. You got me. day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me read you this uh quote from the message. Let your light so shine before men. Brother said here, I'm sure that's what we are all here for correction and to get an understanding of what we can do to make us better Christian. If I have one thing in my life that I desire, you will be a better Christian than I am. And I am sure that the hearts crying of uh let me read again. And I'm sure that the hearts cry of every soul that is here tonight is to be a better Christian. &gt;&gt; MY FRIEND, I want to tell you, you came here to BE A BETTER CHRISTIAN. YOU COME HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LORD CAN REALLY work sort your issues. YOU CAME HERE because you still have hope. [screaming] Many people have said you will not even attend church. But you came here because you have hope. Hallelujah. Amen. We can rise and shine. This is our age. Hallelujah. Amen. No wonder the prophet when he drew the the the seven church ages he said there was light in every age. Who are that light? It's you AND ME. HALLELUJAH. It's you and me. We have to rise and shine again. Hallelujah. Amen. rise [screaming] and shine. &gt;&gt; Oh my, &gt;&gt; let's just if if there's anything that hinders you. &gt;&gt; Last time we were sharing about uh last Friday on the overnight. We shared about uh take take the baton. No, take the baton that like that they give out. [laughter] I I know all of you in school to run that you used to run and you give out the baton. You give out the baton and another one runs runs runs and gives another one and gives another one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I I had that inspiration, I forgot actually brought you something. I saw a matchbox and I said, "Uh, this matchbox, if you you have if you how do they call it like, you get out that match stick and you pack that matchbox and fire comes out." I just want us to type it to the word of God. You are that maybe that thing that you have to get scratched that MATCHBOX LIGHT. HALLELUJAH. That matchbox if I would put it anywhere here on that is flammable. IT CAN BURN this whole world. Something will connect to the other thing. It will connect to the other one. It will connect the other one. It will connect and connect and connect. burn almost the whole world just of one stick. WHAT OF A BELIEVER WHO HAS BEEN IGNITED BY the word of the Lord? YOU CAN BURN AND SHINE and burn all the things of the devil and burn all the territory of the devil. &gt;&gt; Just one seed, just one believer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just one believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just don't look at a group. &gt;&gt; I think that's why the Lord said in in the with the Gentiles, he deals with an individual. He deals with an individual. An individual can spark out light that will shine to THE ENTIRE WORLD. WE SEE AFTER after the that period when uh uh that there's a period in the seven church ages that the dark ages around there. But what did that light again come from? Where did it come from again to shine? You see that is still lighting up to now. It is maybe it was one believer, ONE believer and that's why the Lord says where two or three are gathered or where two believe and agree. Yeah. when they believe or when they come together in the Lord, yeah, he will be a minister. I just want one fellow believe to just believe and catch THE FIRE AND RISE AND SHINE [screaming] in this world. IT IS THE END TIME. NO MORE TIME TO SHINE. It is now. Now. Now. It is our time to shine. That's why the prophet say that THE BRIGHT SHORT QUICK WORK YOU SHINE TO SHINE your brother that when YOU LIGHT YOUR light will shine onto other people and they will glorify God. You attract your brothers and will make the full bride. My friends, this is our time. This is my time. Tell your neighbor. This is my time. This is our time. FRIENDS, MANY things have have come along the way. But let us keep pressing on. Let us keep pressing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's keep focused. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the in the message the great sh the great shining light the prophet said and if you will ch you will not and if you'll notice God only reveals himself to those who search and long to see him. Draw nigh unto me. I will draw nigh unto you and I will draw nigh unto you, sayaith the Lord. And sometimes God lets things happen so that we can draw nigh unto him. GOD HAS surely ordained that certain events must take place and THEY WILL UNFOLD JUST AS THIS great they will unfold just as this great time clock ticks it off. The mystery that was hidden from ages AGES in this age and where the people hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was listening to some message brother was saying that he was on a journey and he saw a signpost. He was showing hungry just hungry. said after some meters then they posted they had to put another Hallelujah when you look at it you'll just be there maybe there's something maybe there's foodmen So he said &gt;&gt; like all those advertisements &gt;&gt; are paid for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said we are the billboards of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are the billboards. They pay for them. &gt;&gt; But he has sponsored these billboards. We he has sponsored us to be the billboards. Rise your feet and shine. Amen. Hallelujah. Rise your feet and shine. Let's read Isaiah 6 verse 1 to5 it says arise shine &gt;&gt; for thy light is come and the glory of of the Lord is shine upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon on thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee, and the gentile shall come to thy light, and the gentile shall come to thy light, the kings to the brightness of thy rising. Lift up thine eyes around about all [screaming] they gathered themselves together. THEY CAME to thee. Thy son shall come from far. Thy sons shall come from far. And thine daughter shall shall be nursed at thy side. AMEN. THEN THOU SHALL shall see &gt;&gt; and and and flow together, &gt;&gt; and then and thine shall fear and be enlarged because the abundancy of the sea shall be converted onto thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The forces of the of the gentile shall come unto thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We see the light that were the the Israelites that was on them. This was a prophecy that the the it will shine to us the gentile. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And is now shining. Amen. &gt;&gt; In our camp, IT IS SHINING IN YOUR CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Let's just rise and shine &gt;&gt; because the word of God is here to ignite us. It is here to ignite every one of you. Every one of you. Just get hungry for this one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Oh God, I want to see. I want to see what you said in your word. I just want to put a challenge to this word." Say, "Oh God, YOU SAID THIS. PUT IT TO A CHALLENGE. Just be right with it. a challenge. If he fails, &gt;&gt; then leave God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be right. &gt;&gt; Don't just ask God that God this, this, and this, this, and this, this, and this, this, and this, this, and this. And then for you, you've not played your part. That's what we as many believers, we do that mistake. We blame God. WE SAY, "OH GOD, THIS, OH GOD, OH GOD." But we do not. We do not look at our side. Hallelujah. We do not look at what it is like pointing at someone that you made a mistake. But I believe the Lord does not make a mistake. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's we that MAKE MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; I want you to get ignited by THE WORD AND LEAVE THOSE MISTAKES THAT [screaming] burn the mistakes away. Just identify your mistakes and say, "Oh, God, I'm sorry." AND THEN MOVE ON. SEE THE THE WORD OF THE Lord shining in your life, shining in your family, SHINING IN YOUR CHURCH. BROTHER ARAB SAYS the pastor does not come with uh does NOT COME WITH REVIVAL in his briefcase. IT DOES NOT. REVIVAL COMES FROM US. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. You hear THE WORD OF GOD UNITED, REVIVAL COMES. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. When you read the the history of uh like the way revival used to come, it is a person got so hungry, he got frustrated, said whatever comes I want. the world survivor. How many like if you go on YouTube, you'll watch its people got on fire. People reached a point of pledging allegiance and say I will follow the the Lord. a mother who had a baby like you see sister charity there he gives the child to brother Isach when they're killing people because of Christianity he says I'm here WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS that can any manufacture that being ignited by the WORD THE WORD BECOMING TRUE TO YOU. [screaming] AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You just feel like you're connected like electricity. When you connect the wires, you just SEE the one one cable here, the light will go off. But now when you bring it back, you'll see again life. &gt;&gt; There's a disconnection. There's a disconnection among the believers. Disconnect that we need TO CONNECT AND SHINE AGAIN AND RISE AND SHINE. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR YOU HAVE TO RISE AND shine building. THIS MESSAGE.

Let me tell nothing good comes without a challenge. nothing in LIFE even Jesus had to come to die to pay and the word of God tells us that shall we leave him to bear the cross we are part of him. He's the head and we're the body. So that means we are part of him. But he paid for it all. Hallelujah. Is our duty to just identify just ourselves with him and say my husband paid for you which is the Lord. Friends, I don't know why I'm feeling this been on me for so long. But that everyone like we have to rise AND IS ENOUGH. HALLELUJAH. Enough is enough. If the the word of God has told me something and I type myself in it, I have to rise and say, "This is mine." Like said, "Give me my mountain. Give me my mountain." &gt;&gt; Why? He was identified with it. Friends, I don't want you to get ignited by a preacher or an excitement. Because if any other thing ignites you, if this money that ignites you, If this may be a booming business that ignates, my friend, the word of God again says that heaven and earth will pass up. But the word of God, Hallelujah. If I want to give you something that can ignite you, it is the word of God. because it will never fail you. IT IS A SURE DEAL. A sure deal that you have to lie. Though sometimes we don't believe we say but I've tried I've tried but it is not again working. The preacher told us that the word of God can ignite us. But now I've tried to to to myself but it is failing. Maybe you like when you put a matchbox in water [laughter] and you come and That's what most of us believers do. Then you come and scratch yourself. [screaming] Yet the word of God, you've just put aside. You put it in a condition that cannot work. You come and scratch. Now I've come now. Yet you in a wrong condition. You put it in A WRONG CONDITION. NO. Like the the word of God. You put it in a wrong condition. It is like putting a plant in a box. If you get a bean, you put it in a box. They say that a seed has life. Now let me put it there. Now is safe there. No one will take IT BUT YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN IT. YOU HAVE JUST GIVEN it a a like you've stored it so well but you have not given it the required conditions the ground. Hallelujah. And then the seed has come and rise and shine. That's why you see flowers, it comes out, it blossoms out out from the ground. This flesh of ours, it is the ground and the seed is in our soul. Hallelujah. Put your body in a good condition and watch that seed that is in you. Hallelujah. The seed of the word that has been preached, the seed of the word that you have read. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think I've been so long. Am I so long? &gt;&gt; Let us see where we can Oh, I still have some time. Hallelujah. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's read this quote here. Brother Brham says, "You are a star. Every Christian is a star, to guide the lost, to guide the weary. How many have heard that? &gt;&gt; The foot of the traveler, to those that are seeking, then the star cannot be guided by itself. Let me read again. The star cannot be guided by. It must be led by the spirit. It must reflect the brilliancancy of God in in its life. Abstain from the things of the world. And to live godly and soberly in that presence, in that present life, it must reflect the light of its great one that shined. We are the stars that are going to shine. But we cannot shine on our own. We are shining by this word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We all know the word of God is God himself and the spirit is God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is not your own like you'll your own efforts that you're going to sit down and say how can I make this circuit work for me and light this light this or I have to read maybe other books. It is not your work. It is God's that has already been done already. Hallelujah. It's as just rising. You rise and be in your position and shine. If all believers here can do that, As you have read here, we all come here to be better to come here to be better Christians. We pray to God say, "Oh God, make me a better Christian." Because he said in his word when he comes, we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes you look at yourself and you say, "How will I even look if God comes now?" Just keep cleaning yourself. Keep cleaning. The time he comes, you'll be clean. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just keep cleaning yourself. Just keep working on yourself through the word of God. Sometimes I I I always ask myself when my back is against the wall. What does God want me to do here? I ask what does God sometimes in when you're crying you God good God what do you want me to do sometimes you you fail to pray you just you just like in your mind you you you're speaking as thousand words what does God want in this matter that has come in my life. Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You ask yourself, &gt;&gt; you think sometimes you even ask friends and friends don't help you. You feel you are alone. But I want to tell you this secret. This word promised, &gt;&gt; God will not forsake. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God will not forsake you. Hallelujah. Amen. God will not forsake you. Let me tell you if right now Maybe a lion enters here. Is this is it okay? If comes here, you see like mommy, he loves his children. But if it comes, everyone will run for you. Say, "OH MY GOD, you remember when you're out." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But who protects that child? Sometimes you see here we don't have anything here. Someone can jump from there and to save the life. But God never forsakes us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even when you pass there, he's going to protect you, even when you get you get an injury. Sometimes I remember when we were at school. We used to sleep in the morning preps, they they tell you go for morning prep, go for mornings. You're tired, you don't want to wake up. And then they come with a cane. the teacher comes and you don't know where the sleep goes. &gt;&gt; You even don't know. You'll find yourself outside. &gt;&gt; We used to look at some children. They used to come from on the on top from a flood from a flood. Not even a up to down. And you wonder, you say, "How did he make it?" [clears throat] But still, God protected. Sometimes you have to to make a a suicidal. It will be like a suicidal move. Say, "Come what?" May I'm going to believe the word of God. And before you know, &gt;&gt; you've won. Hallelujah. Say, "I never knew that I would make it. &gt;&gt; I never knew that I would make it. Trust the Lord. Trust the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Friends, I just want to tell you, trust the Lord. Hallelujah. Sometimes the Lord will cause you to make a move that you as a person like in your in your own efforts you cannot do. Say am I the one who jump from there? Am I the one really? Am I the one who really ran that fast? You look at yourself. But guess what? It is God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just want you to get ignited by the WORD AND RISE and shine. Hallelujah. Rise and shine. Rise to the challenges. God knows all the pressures of this world. He knows it well. He knows everything that we don't have money. Like in the minor church age, he said, "I KNOW YOUR POVERTY." HE SAID HE DID. He knows the poverty. &gt;&gt; THE LORD KNOWS EVERYTHING. HALLELUJAH. When you go back home, say, "God, you know everything." God you even ALONG THE WAY I KNOW the devil is going to tell you what haven't you ever heard no preachers have come from abroad we have had youth meetings what haven't what haven't you done but maybe it is your time to rise AND SHINE AS A DEVIL OH, GET BEHIND ME. Enough is enough. And before you know, you're already shining. Hallelujah. You're already making a step to a better is the dangerous moves that we have to make. DANGEROUS ONE WHEREBY YOU YOU WILL CUT YOUR FRIENDS. You'll cut everything and say if God said this if he said I'm the light of the world. If he said I'm the salt of the world, then I have to rise and we are the people. &gt;&gt; You are the people. &gt;&gt; You say me. I'm the one. So what are you SUPPOSED TO DO? RISE to every challenge. The Bible says &gt;&gt; he has given like the greatest weapon that God has given us is prayer. Hallelujah. Not your life when you you're praying so much. just not I've seen it many times in my life sometimes I get disturbed things take me I end up praying but when again I realize I look back I say but the other life was better life was a bit light was light for me because of word. It was not I was not living on my own energy. I was just tapping from the living founding. When you're praying, you don't you don't just pray words. You refer to the word. You say, "God, you said this." Ah, &gt;&gt; he said, "Lord, you'll strengthen the weak." He said, "Lord, even when we faint, I think it is He said those that that like trust in the Lord, he shall renew their strength. They shall mount their wings like ego eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Hallelujah. What what scripture do you want now to rise and shine and rising and shining is not always easy. You'll fall. You rise. you fall maybe you you nearly to that you slide but again you wake up and you make a step and you say I must shine &gt;&gt; and shine after because you've been persist a persistent on it. Being persistent does not mean that you don't get discouraged. You get discouraged. You say no. You say, "Okay, I went and it didn't work. I'm going back." Maybe what? What? What? What is not right? You check You check around this one. Oh, you leave that &gt;&gt; and then you'll end up shining and you you'll end up being in the position you want to be. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother here again says, "Although peculiar, yet the star was yet the star was brilliant. world world affair but brilliant as sacrifice before the Lord. We prostrate ourselves as maggis as the maggis magis. Okay, &gt;&gt; you can say amen. &gt;&gt; If you hear tongues and you don't understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Huh? The mag that did that did in the presence of the of the king of kings to reflect his light. I think God bless you, brother Isaac. I think we got an interpretation. Hallelujah. Friends, my main message today. Rise and shine. Just rise and shine. As the musicians are coming I want us to just break that spiritual ice pack by the word of God, by the light that comes from What is the source of our light? It is God himself. So don't be worried that my light is is very small. It is the Lord is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like we have heard like those men, &gt;&gt; brother Bernham says they rose and and gave their testimony and we see them shining. We can also make it now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me read this as uh these scriptures I'm finalizing in the book of Acts 12 verse 7 to 8. Uh it says, "And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon uh came onto him, and a light shined in the prison, and he smains fell off from his hands." And the angel said unto him, "Guard thyself, and bid on thy sandals." And so he did. He saith unto him, "Cast the garment out of thee, and follow me." Amen. As we are thinking about those scriptures, Peter was in prison. You may be in a certain prison, but the angel is telling you through his word that arise, arise. If you take this with urgency, it would help you. But if you just look it as any man's word then I don't know in John John chapter 1 verse 45 it says in him was light in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and The darkness comprehends. In him was life. And the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehends me. Brother says, "You have got a sponsor tonight. Christ wants to sponsor you. If you want to let your light shine, be a billboard for him. Be a billboard for him. Won't you come be a billboard for me? Here is your sponsor. These are not my words for you. Even any if it was any other preacher, they're not his words. Even if the our pastor, whatever he speaks here, they're not his words. Just a mouthpiece. Even brother Brham was just a mouthpiece. It was God. He's your sponsor. Come and take him now. Shalom. As we sing, we walk in the light. for [singing] beautiful light.
