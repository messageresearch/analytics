church the truth you are the bride of jesus christ [Music] hallelujah hallelujah means praise our god hallelujah there is a way so this morning i'm speaking once again on that which is perfect is calm and this will be the third so the things that i'm going to share i've been trying to gather now uh might be a little bit deeper for some beings but please i would like you to pay full attention you know more some of these things will help you to be established in christchurch that means even a car is coming and don't say now god has provided for him which means he's also working on youtube working on you um now we've read john 3 john 16 to summon your khan accommodation how big when he the spirit of truth is come and i did not speak about last sunday because i did speak on it on wednesday uh sunday i where not speak about last sunday because i spoke about wednesday amen sunday with this actually i mean uh we were in twilight and god gave us a wonderful time there come here and uh the saints sent their greetings to you amen in the name of jesus christ and uh brother martin god bless you for giving the word on sunday organizing sunday now in johnny says when the spirit of truth has come until he is going to do many things again that could have intervened one of it we saw that he will guide you into all troops [Music] so we already spoke about him as a guy he says he will show you things to come again again so in other words million dollars there will be things to come wake up into every night just like you see a little child whatever number [Applause] [Music] so we were able to speak about the maturity of the or the growth of the church and when i saw when i talked about the church i am talking about the church edges you know some people you know uh just think that church is judging the church okay first of all i want you to understand that these are fellowships every group you see gathering somewhere whether that one thousand two thousand or one hundred or a few like here it is a fellowship um passed that track request they can see you amen i mean and that church has been on this earth from the days of the apostles until today but now we read many prophecies talk about that and say that that church is coming to maturity there have been different messengers that [Applause] [Music] [Music] been the same holy spirit and we found out that this oil was being powered into a reservoir you know i don't know if i have the image here i might not have the image to show explaining but we didn't speak about it the other day how many remember you remember that okay so then that reservoir was collecting all the oil and that and this reservoir was a symbol of a prophetic ministry from the olive trees and it would be collected into that reservoir amen from god a messenger jesus christ [Applause] [Music] it was lighted by god the pattern of god how he has been dealing with the church from the days of the apostles when he sent the first apostle to me foreign [Music] to help you study on the chart ages in full weight mechanism you can have it for free without money with that hallelujah i mean he's talking about these things very precious thing i wonder people sell very useless books for a lot of money and people buy it [Music] it was the first one you can say yes and apostle paul amen when they believed in god they were coming from paradise to go to gloryland changing dimensions in order to go in that place and wait oh hallelujah and [Applause] you have [Applause] foreign amen it is not because of the pilot it is not only the pilot symbol it's also because of what the plane is made up of we are going to lift off from the ground you get in this city amen this is not just a story this is our reality this is the real thing don't think we are telling fables i don't think we are wasting our time foreign the wise [Music] last days freedom now is the same by you anytime pretty much is it billy graham no be regret for roberts not your only healing message because it leads me to jesus christ yes not to him as a man too many preachers in our generations foreign like a wise man never said about this they decided to follow this star in our generation i am one of those men you are one of them is at hand the same day this message is about jesus christ when the star took them to jesus disappeared now it was time to church for them to be with jesus it is our time to say that is [Music] i no longer believe it anything i used to believe in women and preachers i no longer believe because his message has turned me back the holy spirit the denominations are talking about is not the holy spirit the holy spirit they talk about is the one that allows them to do anything they want as long as they feel it [Music] [Music] is spoken of in the book of revelation will be revealed [Music] [Applause] john [Applause] hallelujah before the coming of jesus but in the days name and never [Applause] [Music] the things i'm speaking about their prophecies and the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me saying president obama go and check the little boy is [Music] these things [Music] this thing [Applause] [Music] amen to remove every material amen that's why you are happy you can the power to create ammonia is so the word the second thing this message of revelation 10 7 is going to do will be to reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders which will be the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be this divinely revealed mystery truth that literally will turn the hearts of the children to their pentecostal to read from the message says is is this the sign of the end star to see this mystery truth brother despite the revelation i didn't get it now the great mysteries are avian number one the mystery of the kingdom of heaven because you may hear me talk about mysterious mysteries but you don't know the many mysteries can you get a seat for the brother mysteries mystery is the mystery of israel's blindness during this age kabakka the kingdom is hours now cut your work back the jews are cut off have you died the second mystery is the mystery of israel's blindness during this time of germany the mystery of the translation the living saints at the end of time the end time of this age [Music] and we did talk about that as i was starting to turn it so the fourth mystery a challenge of is of the mystery of the new testament church as one body composed of both jews and gentiles you don't pray as a little boy a little girl christ same yesterday today and forever many people still think that jesus christ was the second person of the godhead [Music] and the end time community is the beginning of the creation of heaven and earth how we know [Music] the bible says that because of their anime [Music] huh [Music] [Music] did you say because the scripture says if two shall act and you know this scripture is misinterpreted to mean even if you are in fornication and you say no gum but you are right yes whatever [Music] and [Music] [Music] how does he know you are this woman communication she's money nobody means spiritual prostitution remember that she was a woman which means she's a church a no canisia remember a woman is always a type of a church that's why if you want to know how that church is standing on the word whatever see how the women behave how they dress up [Music] [Music] she claims to speak for jesus [Music] [Applause] nevertheless because they went against the roman catholic catholic church not the people there simon see [Music] out you're available that's why i always tell you whatever this is not just another challenge hallelujah man this is god calling his bride [Applause] foreign their but i'm sure in heaven there is no old woman amen how does it start i will see all my friends in hallelujah square who are a wonderful time we will all now we will sing and we praise jesus his glories to share and you will not see one blind man in hallelujah i said you will not see one old woman in hallelujah amen hallelujah say what you buy your cat [Applause] [Music] who he will go to hell ejecting them again he will drag you with him no rachel that is why in sunderland it is a true church mechanism too from the book [Music] [Applause] and a big head of the woman get prayed you've done it your husband will tell you go back to your home and jesus yes divorce this woman oh my [Applause] he i'm glad i'm one of them amen glory hallelujah amen there are people almost everywhere people who are already having to whose hearts are all afraid with oh hallelujah amen i'm so glad let me send you from you oh i was the son of a priest i would have been down there and everybody was sick amen yes sir if you're offended by this kind of you know rejoicing then i tell you you'll be born [Applause] foreign [Music] now i got i'd like to continue a little bit with this the eleventh mystery a challenge is that mystery bubble on the prostitute [Music] through to give you a little bit kambasuni we know that kane was not the son of adam what did you just say to the bible [Music] because all a woman see in the religions they teach barcelona you are going to hell or gain them and you are going to ban eternally [Music] because we are in him and he's in us so the the guy is going to hell again cannot have also eternal life a world without told us that if you do not speak in tongues you do not have to hold it back so already because of that foreign if you notice singapore are you telling me that it's been very cool oh no sir make the seventh speaking in tongues one of the gifts you may have the holy ghost without speaking in tongues [Music] that of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost and then some people say now you receive the books from the holy ghost as if you are unofficial because you have received the revelation oh but christ christ the person of [Music] foreign [Music] if i because the person of christ will be in you and jacob and i'm afraid in you very well these things know the mystery of water baptism where the extreme trinitarianism has brought it into the title of father and holy spirit but of the god had been fulfilled in the baptism in the name of jesus christ [Music] that now can you take your bible open first peter what a biblio let's give me about 20 more minutes i'll finish who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time first peter chapter 1 verse 5. cathy montgomery david peter here wanna pitch it it's about salvation going to be revealed in the last time when is the last time enough but in the days of the verse of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants which are the mysteries contained in the seven in the seals listen it finished the mystery of god and this age everybody said this the building up through [Music] the way you construct your house from the foundation up to the top not faker account to say given us now we have arrived we are at the time of the roofing justification through easy we are in the third phase and these are the 20 minutes i requested for to explain this in the third phase all things are possible are waving to your navis i'm going to read small small small questions and he cola and it's sent to them sent to us and this message would have the same identification as elijah elisha and john were all having the spirit of elijah upon them and [Applause] [Music] of the last angel revelation 10 days of the seventh angel these mysteries that's others have all been actually revealed why no i'll just go down there to save time now not when please listen this is very important please pay attention i know when you take long money [Music] meaning by the time he was preaching this 1965 the mysteries are already beat up where is that yes but the message that follows the healing service god bless you no one else okay true all right i'm gonna read one last word i talk about it a little i close i don't know if you didn't get it still yeah the next service i'll start with that one i'm a service attacker because but it does not begin okay okay all right you don't need to go to a theological segment seminar you this word is enough foreign [Music] is bro [Music] now how many nominations do we have today um what do you think foreign [Music] but through those denominations [Music] [Music] they depend where penned the cost was i lost it and we call them phases when jesus came yesterday after being baptized what did he do answer me yes he's a teacher and they go [Music] [Music] [Music] time came sarah jesus is the minister went into the second face and in the second phase he had what we call disarmament of the heart yeah [Music] because we are believed to be two kids we are believed to kill zach not because you have to see you either you're talking about because we have seen that yeah the people he was one of the biggest pastors in town he was one of the biggest prophets more than 10 000 people we are feeling easy [Music] i want each of you to imagine preaching and cambodia you have seen the miracles oh you have seen the disadvantage because this man was able to know my hallelujah [Music] my ministry is turning a corner of where it is i'm going to preach on something new that i've never preached about it and this was my real message if you do not eat my flesh movie ripe [Music] [Music] [Applause] wow you
