[2:19:34] [Music]
[2:19:38] uh he had some problems some years ago
[2:19:40] that son
[2:19:42] got an attack was a demonic attack i
[2:19:44] don't know where i would be when this is
[2:19:52] [Music]
[2:20:22] [Music]
[2:20:26] but that's how that going uh it was
[2:20:28] that's
[2:20:29] [Music]
[2:20:48] [Music]

[2:21:33] [Music]
[2:21:42] i remember the scripture where jesus met
[2:21:45] the blind man and the disciple asked him
[2:21:48] who sinned
[2:21:50] yesterday
[2:21:51] [Music]
[2:22:06] that
[2:22:17] maybe god
[2:22:19] is
[2:22:21] where it's working his way out
[2:22:26] even yeah this song of mine is a
[2:22:28] minister in one of the pentecostal
[2:22:30] church there because
[2:22:33] and even his pastors never bothered even
[2:22:34] to go and pray with him nervous
[2:22:39] yes i was talking to him
[2:22:41] he was kind of busy but still i would
[2:22:43] talk to him
[2:22:45] i just request you to pray for me let us
[2:22:48] join prayer that we pray for him
[2:22:50] insanity
[2:22:52] i believe one of these days when the
[2:22:54] lord paves us away
[2:22:58] we will go and pray with him
[2:23:01] because i've always encouraged him that
[2:23:03] if you want to see god
[2:23:06] if you want to prove this god that god
[2:23:07] we are serving just believe this god man
[2:23:14] [Music]
[2:23:15] because the bible tells us
[2:23:25] [Music]
[2:23:31] and i just think that the pastors there
[2:23:33] they fear to be disappointed because
[2:23:36] uh how comes that you are
[2:23:39] one of the chief got problems
[2:23:44] [Music]
[2:23:56] and i believe that when we pray
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:10] may god
[2:24:24] bring you disgrace
[2:24:33] [Music]
[2:24:37] until the day

[2:25:50] i just want to request you to have your
[2:25:52] seat for a few minutes

[2:25:57] preaching organization
[2:26:04] and i want to read it to you
[2:26:07] before we close
[2:26:09] the message
[2:26:11] we would see jesus
[2:26:15] 1962.
[2:26:18] where he says now the word is a seed
[2:26:26] now most of you brethren are here i
[2:26:28] suppose
[2:26:44] and you put a seed in the ground and the
[2:26:47] next morning you go out and dig it out
[2:26:56] and say
[2:26:57] no
[2:26:59] my corn ain't
[2:27:10] where is that part brother
[2:27:12] and you say my corn isn't growing yet
[2:27:24] you go back and see if it is growing
[2:27:29] it never will grow like that just over
[2:27:31] the cooler way do you know
[2:27:33] every time you dig it up you delay it it
[2:27:37] isn't that right
[2:27:42] that story was also appropriate
[2:27:46] and told us
[2:27:49] as much as naturally mr tortoise is
[2:27:51] slower than mr hair yet
[2:28:11] on
[2:28:12] it's not about how fast you can get it
[2:28:18] but it's about uh how uh
[2:28:22] you can make progress every day that's
[2:28:46] [Music]
[2:29:19] [Applause]
[2:29:20] don't
[2:29:34] give me the coat again and then you come
[2:29:36] and then you know you you you put your
[2:29:38] seed under the ground again
[2:29:40] the seed is sure it's going to grow
[2:29:42] amazing
[2:29:44] but if you
[2:29:45] you say well you planted today you say
[2:29:47] let me go in the morning i check it
[2:29:48] never
[2:30:02] what do you do
[2:30:04] you know the earth was made to grow the
[2:30:06] corn oh my god
[2:30:10] that is the purpose of the earth
[2:30:13] that's the purpose of your heart
[2:30:20] [Applause]
[2:30:51] [Music]
[2:30:57] it's not up to you to manifest the
[2:30:59] future
[2:31:01] it's not up to you to manifest the move
[2:31:03] of the holy spirit
[2:31:06] but it is up to you to commit that seed
[2:31:09] in your hearts
[2:31:25] i can't do this
[2:32:01] [Music]
[2:32:07] and then you go out there in the world
[2:32:37] the sins that may endanger it from
[2:32:39] growing or you could be living
[2:32:42] just keep on believing it i'm going to
[2:32:45] commit it to god
[2:32:46] makes it grow
[2:32:48] you all believe that
[2:32:50] any promise that god makes you
[2:32:54] you just plant it in your heart and say
[2:32:57] it's mine
[2:33:03] any promise expedition
[2:33:08] [Music]
[2:33:18] promise to you i've
[2:33:20] i've made a promise to you so every
[2:33:21] promise that god makes you but it's
[2:33:23] still young i don't know
[2:33:24] just plant it in your heart when you see
[2:33:27] them motivated and say it is mine oh god
[2:33:31] god gave it to me
[2:33:32] katrina it is mine
[2:33:35] god gave it to me catanda achieved
[2:33:38] can you say that
[2:33:40] it is mine
[2:33:42] god gave it to me
[2:33:44] he said by your stripes you are healed
[2:33:46] by my stripes you are
[2:34:11] and the devil will speak back and say no
[2:34:13] you will not overcome
[2:34:42] how
[2:35:10] how
[2:35:21] you can't agree with me and remain the
[2:35:22] way you are talking
[2:35:24] about
[2:35:52] corn crop as soon as you plant your core
[2:35:59] but potentially it is there now
[2:36:04] as long as you leave it alone we can
[2:36:06] strong
[2:36:18] and every word of god is dramatized by
[2:36:20] god

[2:37:07] for a few minutes and let us finish this
[2:37:09] quote because it's really very important
[2:37:10] it says that's right
[2:37:12] don't keep digging it up now
[2:37:15] you will read it objection
[2:37:17] read your crop every time you do that
[2:37:22] just committed to god and believe it
[2:37:24] which way that don't look it is there
[2:37:25] and now he says now for instance say
[2:37:28] for instance i was up here on the
[2:37:29] mountain somewhere i'm a room that i had
[2:37:31] nothing to eat
[2:37:36] and before i could get anything to eat a
[2:37:38] loaf of bread would say um i would say a
[2:37:42] lot of a lot of blood would save my life
[2:37:43] and the purchase price of a loaf of
[2:37:45] bread say is 25 cents
[2:37:55] where somebody come in and say what's
[2:37:57] the matter about brothers
[2:38:08] why don't you get some bread no i'm a
[2:38:10] restaurant
[2:38:11] and then i would say i haven't got no
[2:38:13] money
[2:38:14] when a loaf of bread is worth it it's 25
[2:38:17] cents
[2:38:20] yes sir but i haven't got twitter
[2:38:23] well you would say here brother
[2:38:37] i can be just as happy with the water in
[2:38:39] my hand to buy the love of bread as i
[2:38:41] will be with the love for bread itself
[2:38:43] because i have got the purchasing power
[2:38:45] for the love for breakfast

[2:39:06] quarter in my hand as i could be with
