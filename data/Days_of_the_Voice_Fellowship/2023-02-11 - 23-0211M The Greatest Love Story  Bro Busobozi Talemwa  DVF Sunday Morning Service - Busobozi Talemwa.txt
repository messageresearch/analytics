of the Lord please I would like to invite you to have your seat I'd like to greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ to be in the of uh before we continue I have a testimony here this is from Brother Dr Peter M he says God bless you I thank God for a business opportunity a colleague of mine gave me to run a medical facility in I think uh H the way he told me the testimony he ought to have changed these [Music] words because it was unbelievable but it was in prayer he lost his job some years some months ago but he just said you know someone just telling him you know I have several hospitals and I want you to help me to take over this one so do you think that is a man that is God so you should have said God gave me to run a medical facility so he says I he knew the person is calling a friend of his he knew him for the first time and they they met when he was trying to help him to register a clinic in NAA [Music] and through that instruction in the process through that interaction in the process rather he told me of a medical facility that he doesn't have time to run and uh his new uh and he needed to cut cost his costs and so he asked him if he could be able to take it as a manager and he accepted and so actually the brother even paid the one month rent and he has started to run it already he didn't want to say it but I believe there was was given to him believe every footstep is possession so we want to thank God for that testimony for brother Dr M we believing for more God knew that it ising for the funds for the church and he has already started opening doors for the people amen I also had a testimony of open offer Brother Joseph we bless the name of the Lord uh so to those of you who did not attend our meeting on Sunday would like to let you know that we uh we instituted uh a new system of being able to do fundraising for our land and and H we instituted a system whereby we shall have uh seven groups and in each group there is a team leader and who is responsible for fundraising for that team so we divided ourself the whole church in in in sections of seven groups I know there are those of you who might be here and you're not part of any group yet so by the end of the service today you we are requesting you to be a part of a group uh if you know you're not part of a group which means you are not uh participating in this exercise and we would like you to be a part of one uh also members also those groups it is up to the leader or the team leader of the group to do fundraising fundraising is not an easy process but it is easy if the team leader knows what they doing and if you know you're failing uh you cannot be able to coordinate with people how do you know if you are not bringing results then we will ask you to find someone else in your group and request them to take over so uh the brothers requested me that I I uh take one of the ministers said pastor you are the best to handle as the chairman because the one holding the vision but certainly I need assistance and since I was voted by those Brothers as a chairman I was thinking that I also uh uh ask someone to assist me because we will need someone every Sunday here who will be coordinating actually every week he will be coordinating with every group and also will'll be giving us the report the details report every Sunday and since I was appointed I think I'm also going to appoint you brother Andrew youe uh I know I did not speak to you before but we are one family here and uh people are clapping so it means they have accepted and so do you agree brother if you do not agree you have agreed now but because I know I'm putting you on the spot here but if you do not agree you can come to me after service and will apologize and pick someone else but I believe you agree and and so uh he I'm sure he can of course we have our treasure already where all the funds are being given and then he's responsible for putting it on the and um so for today because we did not have a team in place to all the teams we have we do not have organized information but nonetheless I'm going to give you the information that we have and what we don't have I'll ask the team leaders to give it to me here I'm going to read the group Total how much each group has raised this week uh we have the group of Paul and the team leader is brother brother Joel brother Joel raise up your hand people did not see you that's Jo and that team has raised 82,000 this year Hallelujah um we have the group of Iranians grou is that Iranians okay uh this is the group of Iranians grou Irani and the team leader is brother shalom and they have raised a total of 95,000 Hallelujah and so we have also the team of Columba and uh I forgot the team leader who's the team leader sister eser and they have raised a total of 112,000 Praise the Lord we have the group of Martin the team leader is brother Isaac over there if you can and they have raised a total of 10,000 amen so we have we have the group of Martin Luther and the team leader is sister f right up your hand and they have raised a total of 304,000 Hallelujah praise the Lord and we have the group of John wisley and they have raised the total of the leader is Sister Sister M sister right over here God bless you and they have raised a total of 166,000 was someone counting the totals okay someone counting yes brother Isaac online oh he's counting okay I'll need the total and then last is the group group of William Bram who is the leader again the team leader oh yes my daughter here sister and they have raised a total of 140,000 Hallelujah do you have the total what the total amount 999,000 shs hallelujah amen our our weekly Target is 1 million for the first time at all amen and so we are 100 oh rather about 9 98 99,000 Chings [Music] short so the leader this month this week has been has been Martin Luther so let us give a big hand for the members and of Martin [Music] Lu amen and number last has been Martin we are not clapping for Martin we are encouraging Martin to do a better job now there are some groups that have a lot of students and the students are not even around Ino I understand Martin is one of those groups and I think [Music] col so I was thinking what we are going to do we are going to put all the students the in the lower classes in one group as I think sister had suggested last Sunday is at school now so so that we put all the other people who are working in all these groups and we be sure that contributions are coming in now the leader of Martin Luther to S time I would ask her to come and tell us how they were able to make it but because I'm a part of that group I'll tell you how we were able to make [Music] it because I'm a member of two things were done number one when the group WhatsApp group was formed WhatApp uh by the way our leader was Dr but he and I talked we agreed I cannot be the leader because I'm busy he cannot be the leader because he's busy with being a team leader you have to coordinate you know you have to make it happen so we notice that these young people are very good at coordinating and if you want to see all the groups that are doing well the team leaders are sist so some of you who have brothers as your team leaders you may want to make them sisters Hallelujah now and so because they're really doing well they know how to talk to people I'm imagining if brother so and so called say brother we want money immediately you don't even want to give anything if a sister calls and says brother you did not send your contribution okay let me send right now so so I think some of you groups you may want to consider that tactic and also this sister that is leading our team put up a list I know there is this sentiment that you know we are not B says if you're giving giving secret let not your right hand know what your left hand know what your right hand has given and so some are like I don't want to contribute on the group because me I'm humble but even privately you have not contributed it's not humility the same Bible says don't pray in public no the same Bible that said the other thing also says we should not pray in public like the Hypocrites do they come in the in the sanctuary and then they lift up their hands you that is saying you don't want to give in public you are the one who prays in public so you should interpret scripture correctly We Are One family we are one team and we are the body of Christ and if you are because we are not mentioning people here and what they have given those are filed because it is in your group [Music] team so if you are spiritual you will contribute you will put your shoulders to the wheel you will let us achieve the goal because you part of the body and so uh the sister put up that list uh and she was mentioning she kept mentioning who is giving how much and it motivated others also to give the second thing that was done on our team we were able each individual was able some individuals to look out for friends and we added them on our who are not members of the church and so they also helped us to so you as the team leader and your members you can do that and make it happen for for your team at the end of it all we shall buy our church land and the Lord shall take the glory so uh we will have a very brief uh meeting with the team leaders to guide them a little bit praise the Lord and so before we go to the word this morning I'd like to do two things one I'd like to welcome uh sister peace to dvf if you could please stand sister right over here let us give our hand amen sister peace if you go in the early early videos of our I don't even know whether it was on our church channel in she happened to be around she's origin from and so she happened to be around in so she would travel and she would come and she was like almost Our Song leader during that time and uh it used to be so beautiful and humble but very wonderful and so she has been with us from the very beginning but she's been off and on traveling places recently she told me well I'm a part of church I told I off so we say God bless you amen praise the Lord and uh also and brother Andrew and sister phib we are supposed to be in in evening light Tabernacle today because they wanted to go and officially appreciate the Saints but I told them I actually requested them if it is possible they could go next Sunday because I wanted you to be here because there's an anointing which you started and todaying on another one hallelujah amen I know some people already know other people already have rumors and so today let us put it to an end so my son brother sh i' would like you to come over [Music] here Hallelujah you know marriage is a good thing the devil hates it but God loves it um I've raised this young man for very many years ever since he was in physics he has listened to every coun but there is no area that the devil has fought in his life like marriage but today I'm happy that we are reaching the beginning of Victory amen and so he has already made a choice and so I want to invite the young lady but he's going to invite him I think yeah okay are you bringing up with

I'd like like you to join me to also welcome my designer brother innocent right over here God bless you thank you for coming amen we are trusting that the Lord will also visit him and give him the revelation of the word so friends I'm speaking on the greatest love story and an inspiration the reason why Hees the reason why he came um I've preached this once some place and Sh said it was his favorite someone I thought that he would love this and you all will be blessed by this praise the Lord for God so loved the world that he gave his begotten son now love CA him to do this caused him to G there is something about love we cannot be able to uh to replace with anything and so uh the prophet of God says in the message go wake Jesus says God in the beginning he wasn't even he wasn't even God I'm happy to see the brother here from carja there's another one from are you Daniel okay God bless you so that God wasn't even God can I want you to think about what I'm saying that God wasn't even [Music] God does it make sense I've never had anybody but the prophet of Mal no Theologian has ever no PhD hold has ever because it came by Revelation now we know that God is he says God is an object of worship when the Bible says Thou shalt have no other gods beside me he does not mean like another God there be another God but he means anything that you worship anything you R you should not have it's a God if it is your phone it is your if it is your social media it is your if it is someone in your life it is your god and then he says that thou shall have no other God before so he's God and is's God by himself but when the prophet says there was a time when he God wasn't even God he has now even go gone beyond the the first verse of the Book of Genesis the Bible as we know it begins with Genesis 1 verse one but remember and you know someone asked me Pastor who wrote the book of Genesis the Book of Genesis was is the book that shows the beginnings of everything and so it must not have been a man who knew those things it was it is only God who knows what was before the beginning and after the beginning and during the beginning God uses human beings and those human beings are called prophets now God can take a prophet a man and take him before something happened and he shows him what happened before it happened and he can take the same man and show him the future and that's why prophetically if the spirit of prophec is upon me I can be able to speak to you and speak about your future and those things will happen just as exactly as if I knew what was going to happen in the but then you know what that is prophecy but you see there is a gift of Prophecy and then there is a prophet who is born a prophet now a prophet who is born a prophet his messages do not need to be tested by another person but according to scripture if someone had a gift of Prophecy and maybe just came and prophesied over your life you don't just believe that and take it to be that say the Lord if it has been judged by other men who are spiritual [Music] and can say indeed it is of god but a prophet like uh like Moses he was born a prophet his messages did not need to be questioned it was thus sayth the Lord and we see that God anointed Moses and he showed him everything from the beginning and you know now Moses began to write you see in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth so now by the time God takes by the time you know Moses begins to write he did not know he was not there but these things were coming to him by the spirit of Prophecy and now he began writing but by the time he began writing God was already God if you understand it say Amen because he said in the beginning God but here comes a prophet another man who was born a prophet in our generation William BR and he takes this same scripture and he even goes before that scripture and he says before the beginning God wasn't even God now that is not written in here that can be proved by the same Bible If any man comes and speaks in the name of the Lord if some some whatever he says must be proved by what is written because God cannot come to this prophet and say something contrary to what he will say to another prophet and so we know that you know the the analogy is that God is an object of worship and so there was a time that God was not worship he was Elohim he was dwelling with his own souling with his own attributes he was self existent he was a self-existent one he had nobody with him had no angels with him he had no human beings with him he had no animals with him he had no nature to worship he was gone he was just Elohim he was the spirit that gives life and the Bible says he was covering everywhere and you know he he was existing by himself with his own attribute just like shame or like any young man would Exist by himself before he expresses his attributes and so there was a time God was not wor and that time he was not God but when did he become God because what we see in Genesis 1 one he was already god well there is other creatures that the Bible actually speaks of but the Bible does not tell us about their creation St and those creatures are called Angels how many know Angels how many have ever received anel have ever received one if you want to receive an Angelic visitation keep good music in your house listen to the word of God the right atmosphere and angels will visit you and and so the Angels were created the Bible says Angels were created we know that from The Book of Ezekiel and from also the Book of Revelation Angels were created when they were created we do not know we do not know when know what there is no creation story for angels in the Bible we also know that angels are worshippers there is even a band of angels that do nothing but worship God day and night these are not Messengers these his presence and night all the time and they worship him say holy H the only their one they have two wings covering their F two covering Theirs to fly with now the Bible speaks of all that and you know but now the prophet of God goes and says God became God when Angels were created so now he was being worshiped but there was a time that God was not God but I'm glad that I was created for the purpose of wor now of course now there we speak about God a little bit but now I want us to go to Revelation and I want you to hold your thoughts together the service today will have a little more content than I usually give I just want you to keep your thoughts together and let us see how the holy spirit will deal with us don't make conclus before we reach the conclusion because then you will be confused Revelation 127 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon F and his angels now before I continue on this verse are we together church if we together say Amen now God as an object of worship began to um Express his attributes Elohim the self-existence the moment he created angels He had begun to express himself he then became God the object of that was unexpressed attribute of God now in the creation story we see several things he created over time and the first thing he created was light and darkness and he separated the light and the Darkness and we see the other thing was the firmament the space between the waters do you know the Bible says that that that you know the firmament is the space between water Heaven as we call it is actually just a space between the waters so there water down and water up God is amazing God is things are in the Bible also on the third day dry land earth water sea HS Tre now God was intentional there is something I want you to see you know you might think that God was just trying to play a video game to appe himself so whatever he was doing he had a main reason he had something in his heart he had a desire he want to express himself in such a way I want you to follow me here he then created now lights the greater light to Ru the night the less light to Rule the Day stars and everything the fth day then he fish all these were attributes God was expressing himself and through all creation all creation worships him see all the birds in the morning they wake up and they begin there are some birs which were even recorded early in the morning you know you know singing as they sing and then they flap their we every morning and you see the trees you know they was worship him all nature worships him fish worships and then he did the CLE the and all the animals and they multiplied now after God created all these things God still felt aoid God was happy and everything was good but with him he felt he needed something he was still can you imagine having all the riches of the world but you are still Lo God was still Lo because there was no creation that was in his direct image he need a creation that is in his Perfect Image a creation that I can say is unexpressed image of his person and so God was not happy God was still lonely there was none like him but he wanted to have company he wanted to have someone like him can someone he can talk to someone that can carry on do what God was doing let me tell you God Amen then say let us create man in our image amen that is Genesis 126 let us make money in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of and over the of the and over the C over all the Earth and over every creeping so now God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female them all right now many people say you see the there are three gods the Trinity father son Holy Ghost and each of them is a God that's why here he says let us but wait a moment if you want to know the nature of God you can know the nature of God by the creation he created after his image the the one he created was in His image and who was he how many were they one man but he said created he male and female he was one man dwelling with more attributes he was one but he was more he was one but he was many he was one but he was overflowing through him he will have multiplication through him the word will one man he had a lot of attributes that's how God was God is one is a spirit but he's not one like your finger God is more not more than one but I mean God is more more than enough you cannot count him you cannot number because a spirit just like you cannot count water how many Waters do we have Victor all these but how many waters are there one water how one like your finger not one like your finger but more than one more than enough how God is God covers the earth he covers the heaven he covers the mountain did you know that the same God who is in heaven is the same God here do you know he can be in heaven can be on at the same time but in every place he is there in his fullness howan the attributes make him is all there just like you see this two bottom you know it has attributes sodium magesium chlide many many attributes and so this is water and that is water but these are two bottles of water but how many waters are there one water come on one two what am i counting am i counting water one two I'm counting bottles so in the same way God can bottle himself in many manifestations in many form God is one because everything that makes God all the attributes of God was powered in Jesus that did not make Jesus the second person it made him the only god of Heaven he was in heaven and he was on Earth so that's why when he says let us create it was God with his attributes and of course Angels were already created but now the man he was creating was going to manifest perfect image of God and so God would then have Fellowship but the devil doesn't always let the fellowship that way among the angels He had created you know when they saw that there was man in the image of God CH follow me I want you that this was would be a little more follow closely so here are two domains there is a domain in heaven and there is a domain and the domain in heaven was was the place the dwelling place of God now God blessed man on the domain on earth now man was the one seated on the throne of on the earth and God created God was now on the on the throne of Heaven but now when Lucifer Lucifer was one of the angels in heaven not just an angel was according to the Bible he was one of the closest Angelic beings theone of God high up in run he had a lot of authority to make things happen angels were created never to Angels were created be perf but the Bible speaks of Lucifer he says Lucifer lufer thou perfect you were perfect evil found somehow even in his Perfection evil was sin was and you know when an angel sin an angel can never be pardoned there is no Redemption for an angel when Angels sin they cast away forever I thank God I'm not an angel I God I'm not an angel I'm a human being that is redeemable I have within me a seed of life is redeemable every a human being no matter how much Sin from Grace he will always be redeemable God will call him out God is able to do that prise the name of the Lord and so we see when Lucifer see you know God just looked at him and the and you know Lucifer felt like he wanted to lift himself with pride to sit higher to be something to be someone and that's why you should watch pride pride comes before the fall if you feel you are being lifted up if you're feeling better than others no matter how much you have achieved in life no matter where you are in life you will fall down humility is the way up pride is the way down be humble and Lucifer say to the angels the way I see I know heaven like my palm like my palm and I know God and I know all of your angels and you know I have very good vocal cord I'm very good yeah yeah we agree you are very good I have a proposition to why don't you make me your God so you can worship me instead of woring him me now God saw that now God is G so what God did he came down but how did he come down he came down in another form down in a form of an Angel and his name was Michael and he came down to show the devil to show Lucifer if you think you are good I can create another form of [Music] myself in a way of an Angel to come and show you I have better what you are if I made you and you think you are good I have better where this came from and when Michael came down Michael did not come to negotiate Michael did not come to agree let us now have an agreement let us negotiate so that you can take that F and I take my God does not negotiate with the terrorists and the Devil is a terrorist is a terrorist if God did not negotiate with the devil in heaven he cannot negotiate with the devil here and if the devil is tormenting you in your life let me tell you God is not about to negotiate with you God is in you you are not going to negotiate without Spirit you in your life time has to come The Same Spirit which was in Christ if it is in you time comes you say no enough is enough I am not going to negotiate with all these demons I'm going to stand as a Son of God and I'm going to kick them did you know Believers kick out demons did you know that we have been given the authority to cast out demons to cast out Spirits I am telling you what I know I have seen it it is a good feeling when someone is being tormented by a demon and you cast it hallelujah hallelujah I remember there was this guy crying with a lot of strength and eight girls were caring us and when we came they called us we just came I said Lord I quoted Mark 16 I said he said we shall cast in your name because you said this sign shall follow them that believe all those that believe and so I said Lord I lay my hands as soon as I laid my hands know the baby stretched the girls just stretched the demon left immediately and I'm telling you we have power to cast demons if your neighbors call you when someone is demon possess Don't Run Away don't even say let me first go and pray you have the authority you have the power you have the authority the word gives it to you cast out the and let me tell you you believe yourself if you know who you are that demon will go and so he was not negotiating with him and so he told Michael you have out those demons Angels demons God never created demon he created angels but then this Michael when he came down Lucifer Lucifer now had already got very many angels and he had taken them on his side so don't underestimate Satan Satan has power if if Satan can be able to conv angs who are meant to be perf how much more on Earth we are not meant to be perfect bodies that are cor so the devil can can do a lot of damage if given a chance but see friends there was war in heaven Michael and his angels F against the dragon and that Dragon F and his Angel it was a fight and he prevailed not neither was there Place found anymore in and the Great Dragon was cast out that serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he's here on Earth today deceiving the whole world the world is in deception as long as they not following this they in deception they have been deceived by the devil if you are not anointed by God you anointed by the devil there's only two anointings in and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out in now Satan is the is the devil but demons we the Fallen Angels so we have demons and the Devil Himself so many of of you many times are tormented by demons not the devil now the devil is the big guy that's sat that Dragon but then he has many demons Fallen Angels you know and and you know when when when Angels fell God never took away their gifts did you know that that God does not take away gifts God is not like a man when he gives you something and you do something he doesn't like he says give it back to but God is not that way when God gives you he is not ready to take back and the devil had gifts that's why someone can be gifted someone can even preach and go to hell someone can sing so and yet not a Believer someone can be so gifted in many ways but yet still go to heaven it's not gifts that take us to Heaven it is the relationship with Jesus Christ it is that Unity it is that love connection Devil Went Down onto the Earth with all his gifts and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuse of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him hallelujah hallelujah the accus of our brethren is cast down amen he accused them before God both day and night you know the devil is our accuser the devil is our accuser but he says we overcame him by the blood of the L and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives until death therefore Rejoice ye and that dwell in them to the inhabits of the Earth of the sea for the Devil is come down and he great WRA because he knows he has but a short time hallelujah hallelujah knows that he he knows he doesn't have long year and that's why we have to fight as if it is the last moments that's why if we be on fire for God let us do it as if it is our last day on Earth let us serve God with all Z let us be on fire friends whatever is our weight let cast it down because the devil knows he has a short time but the church does not know the church thinks they have a whole lot I tell you we have a short time on whatever weing do it with Precision do it with Zeal do it with fire must do it with consecration with commitment we are not living in the world like wind doesn't know where it came from but we know who we are we know where we came from and we know where we are going we are not falling angels we are human with soul in us and we know where we came from we came from God and we go back to God we are here right now to raise a stand we the bride of Christ is on the standard and when that battle happened lucier found himself lucif in on Earth where on Earth do you think he went The Book of Ezekiel tells us where he went he went straight to the Gard of and he found that Adam was away some place in the garden and they found Eve and began ask speaking to Eve and he beg [Music] her he will come to that short Now The God Who is reaching says now if you've got eternal life tonight then we we always were we always had it there is only one form of eternal life and the reason we always wear is because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that is etern tell your neighbor I am a part of God Amen I'm a part of God there something I'm coming to be a little patient with me today for we are flesh of his flesh we are born of his born we are life of his life we can no more perish that God himself that's what the Holy Ghost is when you receive the Holy Spirit you have received a part of God when you receive the Holy Spirit you have received the life of God can God perish can God perish amen and he says if you a part of God you cannot perish listen to me church we are not praying to get eternal life we already have eternal life now the Bible says if any man in Christ is a new cre is a new creature all things are passed away all things are new he also says he has passed from Death to life to life there is only one source of life when he says we have passed from Death to life I ask you what kind of life zo zo The Zo the life of God and if we have passed from Death in it means we can no longer die amen the life of God himself is in us I don't care where you want to take take me anywhere I cannot die Take Me In The Grave I cannot die take me in the world I cannot die there is a life of and that life can never die that is why even when the devil took us into sin he thought we will die but what the life of Jesus us out of our amen some of you you Demons of fornication but here you are you can say I am free I am beli fre because of Life of God and let me tell you even any demons that is still troubling you oh my my my every demon that is it cannot Prevail listen to me church I am not presuming I am telling you what the word of God we as sons of God there is no demon that can Prevail us because there is zoy light us the moment you receive that life the devil cannot do anything to upset you he can kill the flesh your soul is sa in the arms of jeh Oh Glory Hallelujah one of these days we are going to fly away and even if we don't fly away and we go by the way of the Grave one of these days hallelujah our bodies may be finished but like job said the skin worms May destroy my body but I know with my eyes I can see the Lord why he receive the revelation who you are he a Son of God life of God the moment you have that the devil can do whatever you to you cannot be UT destroyed you will resurrect there is a resurrection morning and I say we shall rise don't worry about the little don't worry about that little last that little demon that little spirit has been fall fall fall and fall and fall and fall and if you a Son of God da of which I believe you are one of these days one of these days we shall know who is you know why because there the deepest of Life the deepest in us that's what God did that's what he let the devil come down he let the devil come down because he wanted to show the devil theology According To Jesus Christ not theology according to the devil go into the Earth the devil was a good strategist because he was created by God let me now go when I go there okay let me try to first of all refuse to follow let me refuse to follow let me just let me just do whatever I'm doing here and when he refuses to accept me then I'm going to go down to the Earth and I'm going to refuse to submit myself and when he sends me down to the Earth I'm going to show him who I am because I'm going to go in his creation when I go in his creation I will show him I will show him that I can disengage everything I will show him that I can destroy the human but the devil did not know the human race a of God human Hallelujah was not like the devil devil was created from another substance but Man was created from God himself and theil because I'm Fallen I cannot be redeemed oh even man I make him for and he can be redeemed the devil made a big mistake why because we are human beings the human race was fashioned out of a thisal never you have seen the movie actor amen doing is it called vampires what is it what do they call them remember zie do they call them zombies are they called what are they called you know you I saw it very many years ago I whe they still sh kill it and then don't behave as if you have never watch what is it called God bless you you a movie a good movie Watcher praise God you cut off it head and then the head would let me tell you science science and and the world is moving on on the devil's you know Direction everything politics is under the devil's Direction but whatever he doing he he is coping from God he knows the principle but he doesn't have the power to make it happen right now science has broken into God trying their best cre human being they call them robots you know that right these days robots can walk they even making robot prostitutes imagine a man buys it never gets to Mar he has a prostitute in his house created by a human being but let me tell you that's wires and and and batteries and things like that you know what you're made of you made of wires and batteries and connectors but there is no hospital that can create recre this is made by God from the special Bank Health Bank of heaven and God himself created these bodies and all the another system of all the connection and how the brain works let me tell you God is God and is God by himself the devil has been trying to recreate make it like God did it but he can never do it because the devil is not the devil cannot create and he thought man will fall and so he was sure and then he came down into the garden and he he inserted his SE into the human race you've heard of evolution haven't you've heard of it they said man has been first he was a and then this man improved improve improve improve and this [Music] man now if that is correct why is because this wrong it's not correct evolution is not correct but the devil brought that idea confuse sons of men but he himself knows the truth he was there in the beginning the Bible says the serpent had a seed and that seed mingle with a woman bring forth a child with a human race and that's exactly what happened was not a son of Adam you can search the Bible over and over and over you never find a place that proves Kan is a son of if you find it give it to me I will repent there is no place but I will show you many places that prove was a son of the serpent was a son of the devil not a son of Adam because the human race was supposed to multiply by Eve the devil came and the body of Eve and he knew Eve before Adam would know and by so doing became with a SE another how how is that well the devil is is an angel but he incarnated into this P creature the Bible says it was the most and he came in it could speak and the devil came in where does that be today God cast it became a snake so today before it was not before it was like me walking like me is it new to you don't you know it if you know say amen and I can prove that by the Bible and that like creature continued to multiply through that seed of continu his lineage but his lineage was never mixed with the lineage of Adam the lineage of Adam was different through through Seth and it continued on when you count Adam and others up to Enoch the Bible then says Enoch was the seven is not included included that's why kan's Works were evil that's why he killed his brother because his Works were but his brothers were right there and the Bible says why was his Works evil because his father was the devil today we have people on Earth whose father is the devil Jesus himself said it and how do we know who your father is these people were saying our father is Abraham and Jesus said no you are liars your father is the devil because your works are evil and you do not believe me everybody who refuses to believe the word of God is not a son of God but sons of God Son of God God at every one of his word Amen in the I don't care about my opinion that is sons of God do I have children of God there is serpent seed in the world today no matter how much you tell them they can never AC because there's no se in their hearts to accept by the seed of God will always believe [Music] every now we are flesh of his flesh we are born of his we are life of his God created everything then he created man to watch over Adam was not just like any other was in the image and in the likess was a part of God he had to have attributes of God in him that is why God say it is not good for man to dwell alone now you say it is a says not so if you're man and you alone it is not good tell all the single Brothers it's not it is not good don't deceive us the Bible says it is not good and even for God himself it was not good for him to D alone so what did he do he created amen a man that was an extension of him life of his life of his and he called that man and then we see that now when he does create Adam everything he said is good but with Adam it is not good for ad also to why because Adam was like God was lonely needed also fellowship and Adam needed to have somebody else but whatever Adam needed don't miss this now whatever needed was in already hallelujah oh my God whatever God needed was in him whatever Adam needed was in him whatever you need in this life is not coming is not coming is in you is in you is in me what do you need do you need a car what do you need you need a house the house is in you it is in you yes whatever you need is right there why because you are like God you are small God that's what the Bible says if you need a wife stop looking elsewhere that wife is in you God created you with everything you need what did God do to make the attributes which were in him to be manifested God did not do much but I will tell

married don't for sisters relationship and these days it's not only Brothers foring sister some sisters can also I am brother be careful that's not how it was in the SCP evil was just there waiting waiting sisters yours is to wait and when she waited Adam turned said B my myib whatever it is and so from there they became one and a great love story started but friends that was just the beginning when they started a great love story then sin came in that was the place and I want to around here and I'll continue another service that was the place that God was [Music] waiting the devil was his God saw him but he left him sometimes when you do wrong things and God doesn't rebuke you you think I'm fine God is just waiting for the right moment if you a sinner repent before too late listen to this moment when it reached there the devil had now you know come to Eve planted his SE and now Eve was corrupt I want you to imagine before he could touch what do you think heaven was like what do you think heaven was like In Heaven There are a band of angels do you think they were quiet they were saying what was going on even after sin God blessed angels to keep the how much more did you know even now there angels watching over your life every day nothing happens to you but what God knows and at that moment there's anel called he's the one responsible for all the waters let me go down let me bring a storm wipe out in danger heaven day was full of s even in danger the garden is infiltrated danger danger danger nothing takes God by Sur think your life is in nothing God knows everything God knows the good things God knows the bad things and God is interested in every little detail about my life even what I'm going through yes God knows God knows and when he saw and he had all that news he wasn't bothered and Michael came he said you remember when you sent me down I kicked the devil but here he is he has followed your he's attacking the woman God said ah attacking the woman let me go and hinder him with a flaming sword God said it so Hold Your Position Michael that's not your job there is something I want you to say God is responsible for a part of [Music] him Hallelujah God was not moving for as long as it was the woman that was not God's responsibility did you hear that Brothers God is not responsible for your wife you are responsible that's why men to marry because they responsibility say see how she dresses see how she behaves in the God will judge you sir do that you are responsible before God for your wife why because she's a part of of your B flesh of your she's your wife love her no one can love her for you no no problem brother sister do it no problem if you are hugging your wife hug the am sing if you want to walk no problem walk there are some people who are telling me over because now they're engaging and putting one KN down is he the first to don't be jealous don't be jealous and don't be can this is a spiritual Affair it's a spiritual Affair the man is responsible for the way he treats his wife that why do men commit adulter they are very busy looking at other women they not taking care of their wies but if you take care of your wife she will always be a beautiful flower years beautiful flower and you will not even have time to look at the beauty of other flowers thank God I've looked at only one flower 11 years and I'm not about to change and we see here that God did not look look at that and want to go and help it was ad's responsibil I'm no longer going to read I'm going to stop let me bring it to a CL there is much more listen he waited he waited and he finish whatever she did left and then now Eve came to and if told Adam do you know what I found I found some nice St serent told me good things and what did you do and I took the and I at you did you actually did now this moment Adam had to make a decision it is not God that makes a decision for the way you treat your wife make that decision I was going to read a cour where says a woman that lives unclean a man should put away and that was the way Moses WR could have Sav now you woman I don't want but what did Adam do Adam was a real man real men defend their wi real love their real and Adam was a real man he said don't you worry you are a b of my B your Flesh of My Flesh you may have no Redeemer but I am your Redeemer Adam your husband I am going to redeem you out of this Hallelujah in the cham knew what he was doing and he went right there and he took Adam he took Eve brought to him says don't worry and the Bible says they two together why did ration why did he of this re that came from because he knew the only way of Defending his wife was if he was a part of it he was the Redeemer of the woman but had a redeemer amen how many get it had a redeemer had a redeemer and had a ration if my redeemer redeems me he redeems me and everything that I own all my possession all my land all my family everything must be and therefore I'm going to take you to andam and falling on and they walked and walked in shame in distress and they went the thickets down there cover themselves some and they were there crying but listen friend all angels in heaven we shocked what is happen to the of Jehovah God his family is gone master one more time let me go down says there's nothing for It's Already Done gabri Master at least give me some good news let me take it to them tell them that something is coming he said don't wor this is redemption I will do it myself I will do it myself God Amen that evening he came down friends he came down and when he came down he did not come down to investigate he knew what happened if God is coming down to your life now he's not coming to investigate he knows everything about he knows everything you have been he knows and that's why he comes down when God comes down he comes down to redem and when he came down right there Adam had the but what did God where are you read your Bible God called the one he was respons where are you says I'm here I'm here fathering myself what you naked yes I'm naked who told you you naked did you eat of the tree that I told not says father the woman you came and what did God do God did the Hallelujah God did the same thing that Adam had God told Adam don't you worry this is the reason why I've come God quickly quickly went and he killed a he brought of and he said Adam son this hallelujah hallelujah and at that moment I believe Adam was smiling because he was seeing what was coming after that brought another kind of by default by default he said Adam don't you worry here is another one for your wife God redeemed Adam and his wife Hallelujah hallelujah amen why because Adam was born of BS of godh of God and God was responsible that's what happened in the garden of aen but let me tell you that was only a type and Shadow amen the same God came down from Glory he came and put on flesh he came down from Glory what was that God condescending coming down humbling himself no wonder when the boys are proposing I don't know where that came from but they kneel down oh I believe is a spiritual thing because tying what God did God came down from his majesty came down from and heed himself heed himself hallelujah hallelujah he said I love you I love you I still love you I'm going to marry you will you marry me will you Mar will you accept that's what he did on the cross he humed himself so that we can say yes Lord and no matter your past life the moment he chooses the moment he chooses love you and you choose to accept it doesn't matter the all things are God you are one from that moment and then he begins defending you he begins fighting for you oh what a love [Applause] story Hallelujah and I said that is the greatest love story she came down and he loved me God should love a I was not worthy but he loved me if I continue just be so long hallelujah hallelujah praise God I'll just carry on on Wednesday the Lord willing but there's a

to record brother Prince's testimony but the prince has quite a testimony he's a young man he's still overcoming but I tell you I thought his testimony is worth listening to he's been he's gone into he's gone into serving God and the devil has thrown him into the world and the Lord has taken him out and now he's preaching this message and we want to hear that testimony we will have some kind of talk show like we had with pastor and his wife will put on the channel so if you not subscribed to the Church Channel please [Music] do because that will not be a main [Music] service it will not be a main service it will be in in the course of the week so you will need to listen to that also some sister that has sent me quite a few questions I think there are some fored people and their s for singles so I kind of felt inspired to uh do some kind of I don't know whether to call it a show uh but some kind of streaming or stream online we shall also later on put on podcast where we shall be answering one by one of those questions so that every young person can be benefited especially on the area of courtship I have more than 10 questions on courtship uh we need to get them answered for our young people what we believe and how we do don't go away from the church and be angry with shame why didn't you tell me some I know we angry with you brother Andrew some came to me [Music] even so I need to tell you why we do what we do How We Do It and that's how we are guiding our young people and whoever follows our coun things [Music] go I can tell you I can even count them on fing we have more prayers we pray they really work you know we pray the prayer at the closing of the year all youer people you made a mistake to stand and say Will Follow Your confession and will make it happen so now one man down another another man down today now another one is coming and another one is coming another is coming one person told me was it you who told me or somebody say that when when there is marriages in the church say it how did you say it when a church has sisters giving [Music] birth brothers are getting married to sisters and sisters are getting married and people are getting saved that's called a living church and I think I agree with him I don't know where he got that from but I think that I agree with him amen because you see it means that God is moving in our we want to be a Living Church not a dead Church we're talking about souls getting saved we're talking about people getting married we're talking about children being born we don't believe we're not not waiting you here so you can go and enjoy life and not bring forth life we want crying babies here praise the Lord because that's a blessing from God those marriages for those who don't fear responsibility so lastly I'm also intending to start um uh I already told you radio broadcast were supposed to have started on the first week of this month so all these things need money and we need 250,000 every week for the radio evangelism so please remember that as well and we will let you know when we get started when we get started when God provides the money why is the money God is going to bless you and touch you and then you'll bring that money and he shall use it for you listen friends the message we are preaching needs to be heard by the word we are not the only ones preaching it but the little we can do we want the world to know so they can come to the Lord amen so I think we'll dismiss you and uh then we shall remain uh I just want to speak a few things with the team [Music] leaders I promise it will be 10 [Music] minutes all right so I think we'll just dismiss you and brother martin desires if you are part of his [Music] group you also stay back let me see those who did not have any group assigned to them [Music] please okay so who [Music] writing pick their names now and then and I think brother Jo we might have to rep to replace your leadership with a sister because you're busy handling many so let's give it a moment while he writes the [Music] names uh brother Joel if you can try to a little faster just write the name and the number and then we shall do the assignment to the groups later brother Enoch the day assign you a group are you assigned to a group oh you've given your name okay okay so those that have not been assigned to groups can stay while the brother writes you and the rest you are all dismissed we meet on Wednesday God bless you [Music] friends while you are going I want you to remember if we give 1 million a week that'll be 4 Millions a month that's the target so every group at least raise 250,000 a week that will be very good it will make us hit the target [Music] quickly me to and just day
