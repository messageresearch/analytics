are you happy to be in the Pres of this evening yeah I thank God that uh we are in his presence and also I thank my pastor for giving me the opportunity once again to stand before the purches of the Lord yeah I know it's one of the place which you cannot get used to and most time when you told to stand you wonder what you're going to say Amen but as usual uh every Minister we uh we have always been trusting in the Lord and we know it's him and him alone who can make us something blessed be the name of the Lord Lord yeah before we take our seats uh let us turn to our Bible visit us in our mid you most welcome brother Kaba you're most welcome God bless you and Mama God bless you amen you turn with the Book of John St John Chapter 11 okay it's uh quiet uh I wonder where to begin from but for okay we can begin from uh from vers 14 of St John 11: 14 says uh shall we read in the name of the Lord Jesus then said Jesus unto then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your sake that I was not there to the intent to to to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him then say Thomas which is called Dias unto his fellow uh andto his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him then when Jesus came he found that he had laid in uh he had laid in the grave for days already now Bethany was n un Jerusalem about 15 or four Longs off and many of the Jews came to Mara and Mary to confort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as he heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus uh Lord if thou had us been here my brother had not died amen my brother had not died then MAA as soon as okay okay 22 but as I know that even now whatever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again 24 said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believe in me shall never die believest thou this Lord Jesus we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read Lord I just humble myself that you come and take this word and make it life to us Lord help us Lord in just few minutes we're going to spend here at least to receive something from you Lord father for we have us all in Christ Jesus we pray amen you have you can have your seat praise be to God yeah it is quite an interesting testimony about uh Lazarus death and Resurrection blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus and this evening uh yesterday was when I was told to stand I was wondering what to say I was asking God you know yesterday you came back when too exhausted so but I trust uh God that this evening he has given me something that we going to share in the few minutes we are going to spend here amen and I'm going to talk uh about the power of Resurrection or resurrection power blessed be the name of the Lord we are here because of that amen how many believe that we shall resurrect how many believe that he will resurrect amen yeah there's a Resurrection coming and already going on even now blessed be the name of the Lord and here where we have read uh I've put down some scriptures uh that we are maybe God willing we shall peep on them and uh we are seeing in John where we have just read the story of Martha and uh uh and Lazarus blessed be the name of the Lord and we are seeing here Jesus is the key point the bible say that when Jesus heard that the first time he heard about Lazarus death he did not come but he continued with the gospel blessed be the name of the Lord it is because Jesus he say that there's nothing I can do L my father shows me so when Lazarus died the father told him to continue with a saving of Soul business because death is not Shock to God blessed be the name of the Lord the power of life and the power of death is in the hands of God blessed be the name of the Lord and here where we have read if you read from 23 it says that uh Jesus said unto her he was telling Martha thy brother shall rise again Jesus was very sure that this man was dead and mother said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day blessed be the name of the Lord Lord Mara believed in the resurrection but at the last day blessed be the name of the Lord amen Mata believed he knew that Jesus that his brother that Lazarus would rise or would resurrect but in the last day and the prophet tells us that the devil always shows us what happened and what will happen in the future blessed be the name of the Lord and it does not want us to know what is happening right now blessed be the name of the Lord and I remember one time one Minister preached and he told us that uh when Jesus or when the disciples were talking about Jesus the devil was was busy enjoying his seat by the day after the Pentecost when the devil had that the lame man at the gate of beautiful God made him to walk that day the devil came out of his seat and then it caused chaos blessed be the name of the Lord because this men they proved to the world that the same Jesus who died and rose again and went to heaven came back and is now dwelling in US blessed be the name of the Lord and there the devil started to wage war with them praise be to God and the reason why God sent this message is to remind us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday is the same today and forever and the difference between as and denomination is that we know that the same Jesus who walked here on Earth 2,000 years ago the same Jesus who came back on the day of Pentecost in the time of the disciple that same Jesus is living in the Believers today blessed be the name of the Lord amen that is what maketh difference amen I'm talking about the resurrection power or you call the power of Resurrection the power of Resurrection is in is within the circle of Christianity blessed be the name of the Lord and we shall see scripture where Jesus referred himself as he is the resurrection and life blessed be the name of the Lord there's no man in history who had ever made such a statement apart from the Lord Jesus because he was God in flesh praise be to God Amen and the reason asked why we come to church what make a difference between us and denomination it is that power of Resurrection when we were in Catholic we used to sing and say we shall rise Hallelujah we shall rise but in fact the kind of Resurrection or Rising we're talking about is the same one which Martha is speaking about here that I know that my brother shall rise but in the last day blessed be the name of the Lord and that's what the devil want you do whatever you want you live the kind of life you want but if you die you will rise in the last day that is a big lie which kind of Resurrection are you going to resurrect to they will resurrect there are those who resurrect to face the white Throne judgment but there is a group of people who are going to be raptured amen and still what is going to make us being raptured is that resurrection power and that resurrection power lies in the word of God and that is the life of God in The Believer blessed be the name of the Lord amen out outside there they sing we shall rise we shall rise in the day of Our Lord but when you tell them that God heals diseases they say it is impossible you see so if you are doubting that God can heal fever cancer AES how can you convince us that you will resurrect look here you died maybe 50 years Jesus comes after 50 years when you already died many years ago how are sure our assuring us that you shall resurrect when you are doubting the power of Divine Healing that is a big lie blessed be the name of the Lord amen hallelujah but we are obtaining oh we are getting this power right now every time we are feeding on the word the word is working in our life praise be to God that's why we encourage Believers to receive the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is that resurrection power amen and when we have him in us we can speak like Jesus break this temple in 3 days I will build it praise be to God Amen if you read John chap 10: 17 and 18 let us go there St John chapter 10: 17 it says that uh therefore do my father love me because I lay down my life and I might take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself and I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment I have received of my father blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus was so sure about what he's talking about Jesus knew that he is that seed of woman who will braise the head of the serpent blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus knew that he was that incorruptable seed praise be to God that even when Jesus died on the third day the prophet tells us that corruption takes place on the fourth day but even death could not hold him captive blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why we sing and say even in the grave he is Lord praise be to God that is the God we are serving he is the Lord of our life he's the Lord of every situation he's the Lord of whatever we are going through is the Lord of your storm it's the Lord of your sickness praise be to God in each and every situation Jesus is Lord praise be to God David says in Psalms 16: 10 that for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption God revealed this thing to David and David saw Christ and here he says Thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption blessed be the name of the Lord and the prophet in the message what is the Holy Ghost he says that what the holy spirit is is the Seal of God that you have found Grace in his sight and he loves you and he believes you and he puts his seal upon you and the Seal of God that is the power of the Resurrection praise be to God no matter how good we are no matter how nice we are how good church member we are but without that we have no Journey blessed be the name of the Lord and if there's something that somebody has to cry for is for the presence of God is for God to give us that new birth blessed be the name of the Lord because it is later than we think we must be sure that when I die maybe you may die in a car crash maybe you may be die of any kind of death but are you sure that you're are going to resurrect are you sure that you have that power that you have acquired that power of resurrection and the power of Resurrection is in Christ Jesus and when you have it brother you are sure praise be to God you see the good thing with the message it is not all about guess work we to be in our domination when you just think and presume that ah maybe because you sang in the spirit maybe because you spoke in tongues maybe because you pray for the sick and the sick get healed and you presume that ah everything is right but when you come this side it's different story why as John the Baptist was sent to forun my first coming your message will for on the second coming amen praise be to God so in this time round we have to be sure amen you must be sure because there is no any other message it is this message for running the second coming of Christ and that's why we believed it praise be to God and that's why we have a better understanding we know when we're talking about worship we know what we are talking about when we talking about Christianity we know what we're talking about when we talk about the Holy Spirit we know what we're talking about amen I remember when we were still in Pentecostal denomination at home when they start speaking in tongues you would think that what was happening my mom in tongues my brothers my cousins my unles but what's surprisingly when we when we we believe the message I wonder where the tongue disappeared from I think I've never I've never heard my mother speaking in tongues and she used to be the Pioneer praise be to God someone speaks in tongues until he suffocates and I was wondering what kind of tongue is this one but when the True Light Came in our family amen that disappeared praise be to God that today when someone is under anointing and speaks in tongues God comes and interprets it praise be to God Amen so we used to be threatened by those big men how dare you I'm a bishop I'm this and this but you come this side and see the different however big you are however great you are we have the waying the measuring stick is here blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise be to God so the prophet said that what the holy ghost that the holy spirit is the Seal of God that you have found Grace in the sight of God we ought to be sure that each one of us have found Grace in the sight of God not because we see sing and shout and cry and dance and jump and roll up and down you must be sure praise be to God because it's later than we think are you having that resurrection power in you praise be to God Amen because there is a man called Jesus Hallelujah who knows no Str praise be to God he cannot be threatened even by death and that Jesus want to Dell dwell in our soul praise be to God for the Bible says be holy for your father in Heaven is Holy it is only through Holiness that we can see God God only sees that token in our lives and that is the righteousness of God not the righteousness of denomination blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus amen Amen Hallelujah Jesus tells us hallelujah praise be to God that Jesus in Romans chap 1: 34:3 he say that Jesus Christ Our Lord was made of the seed of David according to the Flesh and declar to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of Holiness amen by the resurrection from the dead Christ Our Lord was made of the seed of David according to the Flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of Holiness by the resurrection from the dead blessed be the name of the Lord am amen friends there is a power of Resurrection in Christ and that is what we need praise be to God and because Apostle Paul knew that he had that power that's why when he reached his dying moment he said I have ran the race blessed be the name of the Lord amen when there was strike by Revelation and say that what shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus the love of God is not in the things of the world the love of God is not in the things that we do but the love of God is in Christ Jesus amen when you have Jesus you have the love of God when you walk according the word of God we walk in the love of God blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise be to God Amen in the message uh thou knowest all things butam say that Zoe zo means the life of God and you become an offspring of God and God can't hurt you without hurting himself blessed be the name of the Lord when we when we receive the spirit of Christ in us when we have that life that power of Resurrection because know it's only God who can resurrect blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet say that that is the life of God remember zo that's what came from God Amen praise be to God and that is the Son of God which means the life of God what makes us children of God is not this flesh but it is the life of God in us blessed be the name of the Lord that is the life of God and it says that the life of God that so it means the life of God and you become an old of God and God can't hurt you without hurting himself when he sees the blood he will pass over you why the blood was on the doorpost the blood had a voice the blood was the life amen and when the when the death angel when he was passing Egypt the blood was crying we are dead we are dead and that angel passed over them blessed be the name of the Lord because the life was in the blood amen and here he say that God cannot hurt himself if you have the spirit of Christ in you the prophet tells us you are already sealed good amen and that seal cannot be broken until you are day of your Redemption and that is the resurrection power I'm talking about blessed be the name of the Lord that when Jesus comes in us the Bible says that when the spirit that raised Christ from the dead there is a spirit that raised him from the dead amen that Spirit knows no law of gravity that's why when Jesus died Hallelujah he carried our sins praise be to God after he paid the dead we did not we he pay the debt we owe in fact the Dead Jesus Paid It Is Us who owed that de then he paid the debt we could not pay and when he died and buried there is a secret the spirit of Life praise be to God and that's why the bible say that when the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwelleth in us what you need is that Spirit to dwell in you amen he will Quicken you m of body he will Quicken your weak body he will Quicken your weak Faith amen he will Quicken our children because he's the spirit of Life blessed be the name of the Lord that same spirit in Genesis chapter one The Bible says that the Earth was messed up amen but that same Spirit was brooding over the Earth Hallelujah and that same Spirit brought life blessed be the name of the Lord when the spirit comes upon us the commotion is settled blessed be the name of the Lord amen say that you stand un unadulterated a born again son and daughter of God with the life of God in you to speak the word blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus said that break this temple in 3 days I will build it Jesus was the spoken word praise be to God he was it was the spoken word because remember that the angel spoke to Mary and Mary believed so Jesus knows the law which was operating within blessed be the name of the Lord amen he knows that even the power of gravity the force of gravity could not hold him praise be to God that's why when Jesus made the blind blind man you know how sensitive the eye is so this man was blind and I believe he needed an extra care when it comes to his eyes but what Jesus did blessed be the name of the Lord because he is the resurrection and life the first born of all the creation blessed be the name of the Lord so friends I want to introduce you that power blessed be the name of the Lord and that power is in the word hallelujah if you receive the Holy Ghost you have that power in you but if you die without the Holy Ghost you are lost praise be to God he amen without the Holy Ghost we are lost but because God loved us for God so love the world he said that when he the Holy Ghost will come he gave us the promise of the Holy Spirit praise be to God this body has it desire it has a lot of need and without the Holy Ghost amen we cannot manage it blessed be the name of the Lord but I want to tell you this after this evening that the power of Resurrection lies within the word of God Amen if you receive Jesus if you receive this word if you receive it and walk according to it amen and we go further from justification from sanctification until the B of the Holy Ghost then there we are having the power of Resurrection praise be to God that power does not only work within us but even within the creation praise be to God that's why you can pray for a tree and it get healed what is that it is the power of Resurrection amen that power lays within you that you can speak we have heard Pastor telling us how he SP to the rain that is the power of creation amen the Bible tells us go into the world and preach the whole gospel to Every Creature not only human being amen creatures have ears and they hear the word of God that's why one time the prophet was hunting and then the storm was coming he did not know praise be to God and when he saw the storm coming he started running for his life but the voice spoke and told him turn back back and speak to the storm what was that that was the power of Resurrection amen the prophet had that power to speak the creation blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah that resurrection power is the righteousness of Christ in us and that's why Apostle Paul tells us it tells us in Philippians CH 3:9 that and be we found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise the Lord in the message God hiding himself in Simplicity the prophet say that that you stand unadulterated a born son and daughter of God with the life of God in you to speak a word of creation let this mountain be moved and it will remind you praise be to God you remember in Job 14 where it says that if man die shall he live again and all the days of of my life appointed time will I wait till my change come Hallelujah for the corruptable must put on incorruption that is 1 Corinthians chapter 15 vers 53 praise be to God he amen and amen turn to me let's let's read Romans chapter 10: chapter 8 rather verses 10 to 11 we can start from five say for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be caral minded is death but to be spiritual minded is life and peace because the kind of mind is enemity against God for it is is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be amen so they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ is none of his as ask yourself do you have the spirit of Christ are you sure that you have the spirit of Christ he says you're none of his if you don't have Christ is putting emphasis Apostle Paul is putting emphasis here and is reminding the church amen that caral mind is enemity to God caral person will always think about caral things his conversation will be caral his sacrifice will be caral his prayer life will be carel amen everything he will do will be carel when a cause comes like maybe there arise a CA like maybe uh we want to get something it is kind of people who will complain fast every time you're making contribution every time this and that praise be to God and remember God hate maming the Wild and his fullness is of the Lord amen praise be to God it is our role to support the work of God and when we are walking in the spirit it will be light to us amen this will not be a burden that's why a kind of man cannot serve the Lord a can of man cannot praise cannot worship and a kind of man God will never accept his sacrifice praise to God so Apostle Paul is reminding us that a mind is an enemity to God praise be to God because God is spirit and those who worship Him will worship Him in spirit praise be to God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwells in you now if any man have know the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin by the spirit is life because of righteousness blessed be the name of the Lord when the spirit of God is in us our body will have to die because our body will be operating under another law praise be to God and that's the law of life not the law of death praise be to to God Amen may God give us the spirit of Christ but if the spirit of Christ if the spirit of him that raises Christ from the dead dwelleth in you he that raised Christ up amen from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you your mortal body cannot be quickened unless the spirit of Christ dwells in you praise be to God and these are things which sometime we take them for granted every Christian must be sure that the spirit of Christ dwells within us praise be to God when you don't have the spirit of Christ forget about Rapture praise be to God don't even call yourself worshipper because when you are worshiping God is not even looking I [Music] say praise be to God therefore brethren we are debors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you if you through the spirit of the spirit do notify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as led by the spirit of God they are sons of God praise be to God Amen praise the Lord so also is there the resurrection of the Dead in uh 1 Corinthians 15 uh 42 verse 4 says so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption and the message the token the prophets tells us that you must present the token that you are subject for the resurrection you see because the resurrecting power is is already in you do you believe that that the resurrect power is already in you present the token then you are the subject for the Resurrection The Token is the resurrection power and all of us we know the token what is the token the token is the Holy Ghost and if you have the Holy Ghost that is the resurrection power praise be to God and Jesus when he was being baptized the Bible says Heaven opens amen and the voice spoke this is my beloved Son whom I'm well pleased to dwell in he in him amen and because Jesus the Holy Ghost was dwelling in him God himself incarnate in flesh was dwelling in Christ that's why Jesus said put this Temple down I will raise it up in 3 days praise be to God and that's why when he had about Lazarus death that was just a minor thing he said let us go and resurrect him because himself was resurrection and when Jesus reached there and Martha came and said I know he will rise in the last day Jesus asked them for the grave blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why Jesus never attended funerals amen because when Jes Jesus comes to your funeral you just know their Resurrection is going to take over praise be to God Amen Jesus is life when Jesus meets death something happen praise be to God and what we want tonight we want Jesus in our dead condition because he is the resurrection he is that resurrecting power praise be to God when he comes and meet our dead condition it is going to resurrect am because Jesus is that resurrecting power what the church need tonight is Jesus in our lives not only in our mids Jesus in our midst and Jesus in in US those are two different things you need Jesus inside you you need Jesus in your soul let that anointing comes inside of you out let that praise come inside of you out because Jesus is in your heart blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet tells us that no man had ever spoken like that that I can lay down my life and bring it up Talk of the great mens of the world we have had them all over we have read about them amen but when they died that marked their end but when Jesus died even today there is an imput grave proving that he is resurrection and life blessed be the name of the Lord so let us present that token praise the Lord in the message ister s the prophet say that we are you are creature with the resurrection power within us so the church is in it is complete maturity in it complete maturity if you look at when we believed and where we are today there are many years praise be to God just imagine the seed was planted 20 years ago do you think that seed is still in the ground it germinated it has been growing amen we are approaching the coming of the Lord we are living in the Harvest Time praise be to God and what we are seeing in the Pentecostal that is the seed which was planted we are now seeing the fruits they are bearing they cannot bear something much better than that amen because that was the seed which was planted in the beginning praise be to God don't expect them to get better they will get worse and worse because that is the seed praise be to God and the prophet tells us the seed shall not inherit with a Shar so we are living in the Harvest Time this when we are seeing the true seed which was planted in the beginning blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise the Lord the power of of Resurrection is in Christ and that power is in the church because Jesus said whatever was in whatever was in father he poured it in Christ and whatever was in Christ every Miracle every Divine Healing every Power every uh righteousness which was in Christ Jesus he has poured it in the church and you are in that you are that church not in this building no sir you are in that church you are that church amen Christ has poured it in you that's why most time ministers are preaching reminding us about our inheritance that is our inheritance praise be to God you must have your inheritance we must know our inheritance first amen that you inherit the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit is the power to live Christian Life praise be to God is the power of Resurrection it's the power of rapture it's the power of worship amen praise be to God and when Jesus told them show me the grave he was resurrection and he is resurrection even today and he is life blessed be the name of the Lord amen in Romans chapter 8 verse1 17 he said that if children then the hairs the hairs of God and Joint hairs with Christ do you believe that that we are the hairs of God and the joint hair with Christ amen and the prophet in the message uh the Lan Church age he says that with the resur with the restoration of the power with with the resurrection of the word will come the resurrection of the power amen and it says that perfect faith is the master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it amen amen and he said that oh Lord send the Holy Ghost just now somehow into this resurrection and may they rise to their feet in the resurrection power and be identified with Christ in his resurrection Amen in the message Paradox the prophet says we pray father that you will send down Grace in the resurrection power of Christ that you might restore resurrect us to a Living Faith in the word of this day and I believe that is what the church need and I believe that's why God sent this message to resurrect us to the power of Christ that he might restore resurrect us to a living faith in the Living Word of this day blessed be the name of the Lord amen shall We rise on our [Music] [Applause] feet praise be to God shall we pray Heaven father in the name of Jesus father we thank you for this evening we thank you for the few words you have spoken to us we know Lord you speak one word and it means eternity Lord precious father I believe those are the few words you you have given me to speak to your children reminding us about that resurrection power and father we are here because that's what we need and we believe that it's a glimpse of that resurrection power that has given that has keep us moving father for all this time even now Lord we need more of you and we ask that you come down lord Jesus and send down the holy spirit in each and every fasting heart it's my desire the Lord Jesus you will throw each and every individual into desperation because you spoke through the prophet that through desperation Lord that you bring us father the best out of us Heaven father we living in the time when there a lot of thing that is consuming people's time but God may you help us be like Daniel of old that we shall make up our mind not to defile ourself Lord Jesus with a king's meid Lord but bass in our heart Lord to live for you Lord Jesus precious father

that nothing will do it it's not works it's going to be our faith in the finished work amen and that that is where the resurrection power is uh I just wanted to just make a few comments and appreciate you I don't know how many prayed for us uh on the trip to uhuh I see some some some are not raising their hands others are but those of you who prayed for us God bless you God answered your prayers we had I hope you don't mind standing for a few moments we've been standing for sitting for long so God really was with us H we went on Monday uh Monday early morning and uh we we arrived in Lita a little bit late because of a little traffic uh and so we we were very tired of course after preaching on Sunday here and I I thought I would drive but I I couldn't drive the whole time thank thank God we had brothers that could support so it was myself that went Brother Martin was with us brother Isaac back there who else brother ranas brother praise brother Joel yes several people really went and we had a good time we had some good time with Pastor Michael O in his house before we could leave L and then we came back down to a place called Loro now Loro is about 40 kilm from uh from L is that the right pronunciation of the word of the place is it Loro Loro yes Loro okay so and it was a very blessed time because the whole family was waiting uh sister um sister Lilian was able to invite all our family members our brothers most of them were there sisters and and so we were I don't remember how many people really did you count them brother martin you the one who always does that you're good at that I don't usually and when I estimate the number sometimes I go overboard so um but but we had quite a number there and the whole family was there so we had a we had church under the tree uh it was very very amazing and uh we preached this message without fear or favor and five Souls we are ready to be baptized by the time we fin finished so I thought that was a very wonderful thing so the the one of the brothers of sister Lilian and a few others they said now there must be a church in this place so there is no church in that area uh but we believe that a church is going to begin in that in that place in the name of Jesus Christ so already we have uh the sister of haret is also I mean the sister of Leen who is AR yet she's also uh a Believer but she wasn't fellowshipping for a long long time so now some of our children also were part of those that believed and a few others are going to be believing we had pastor Pastor obia jofre also from L who escorted us there and he was interpreting interpreting in langi so uh it was a very good time we had a good time so we also introduced him to them uh we hope by the grace of God we shall keep going back to help them and by the obia will also be coming to help them so let us remember that family and that area of Lord Ro in prayer you know this message must move and we are the ones going to move it God is going to use us Amen
