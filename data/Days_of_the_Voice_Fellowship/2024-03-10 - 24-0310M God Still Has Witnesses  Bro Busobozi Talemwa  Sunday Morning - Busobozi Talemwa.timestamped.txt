[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:39] hospital and we really preached the
[1:12:41] message there for several
[1:12:43] hours want to say
[1:12:45] something
[1:12:49] yes ah okay okay praise the Lord there
[1:12:52] is a lady we prayed for she had just
[1:12:54] come out of the operation
[1:12:58] and the sister was telling me that she's
[1:13:01] now better she even can
[1:13:05] walk but I tell you what that lady and
[1:13:07] her mother and her family they going to
[1:13:09] come to the
[1:13:12] message a little prophecy I gave right
[1:13:14] there and then some other two people
[1:13:16] told me they had say the same thing to
[1:13:18] this
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:23] sister that has them in
[1:13:27] mind amen and also this morning I
[1:13:30] received a fresh
[1:13:33] testimony from Buddha Christian
[1:13:36] Fellowship Fellowship Pastor Jess called
[1:13:38] me this morning with a wonderful
[1:13:39] wonderful
[1:13:42] news uh we've had brother brother Sam
[1:13:45] give a testimony of God's grace in
[1:13:51] his we are so thankful for those good
[1:13:54] results
[1:13:56] and so we were also invited to go to
[1:13:57] Buddha to pray for the um candidates at
[1:14:00] that
[1:14:02] time they had a very good and anointed
[1:14:07] service and so the testimony this
[1:14:10] morning is that they performed they all
[1:14:14] passed all
[1:14:16] pass they passed like they have never
[1:14:18] passed
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:23] the told told me that the
[1:14:27] first got 20
[1:14:31] in and he said that this is the first
[1:14:35] time even the whole performance of all
[1:14:37] the others was very
[1:14:41] spectacular and so reading works
[1:14:44] studying hard
[1:14:48] works
[1:14:50] works sure about
[1:14:52] that amen and um
[1:14:56] uh then I just wanted to let you know uh
[1:14:59] I've I've been hearing a lot of
[1:15:03] questions of course these children being
[1:15:05] our
[1:15:06] children and getting
[1:15:09] married usually I believe thatth really
[1:15:11] marriage is on the shoulders of the
[1:15:17] parents as well as the uh the couple
[1:15:21] getting
[1:15:23] married that we are in total agreement
[1:15:27] with the parents of sister
[1:15:32] favor and the biological parents of
[1:15:35] brother
[1:15:37] sham and we are all in agreement because
[1:15:39] you see they've given us a short
[1:15:42] time and we we cannot be able to you
[1:15:46] know do it the way brother Andrew did
[1:15:49] it uh if we say that they're going to be
[1:15:52] doing meetings meetings
[1:15:56] for five
[1:15:57] weeks I don't know how much they can
[1:15:59] raise
[1:16:01] them and if you give an open
[1:16:05] invitation everybody is going to come
[1:16:08] and it's going to be upon your head
[1:16:11] responsibility to to take care of all of
[1:16:16] them so an idea came up and I supported
[1:16:21] it uh and I think every other young
[1:16:24] person that would want to go that
[1:16:26] direction I feel that will be a big
[1:16:31] relief so that weddings are not very
[1:16:35] complicated
[1:16:38] thing you know you invite 100 people and
[1:16:42] you get 400
[1:16:45] people and you know you cannot be able
[1:16:48] to buy food for all of
[1:16:51] them and then you get headache I believe
[1:16:55] it should be something very simple for
[1:16:56] our young
[1:16:58] people and we should all be
[1:17:02] understanding so that we can be
[1:17:06] supportive of them to get married and
[1:17:09] start families support the work of
[1:17:13] God and really that's what I believe in
[1:17:17] so if you want to have a wedding with
[1:17:18] five people 10 people that's all
[1:17:22] right just the family and the friends
[1:17:25] that's still
[1:17:28] right what they kind of kind of had an
[1:17:30] idea that they should um uh not overden
[1:17:34] the
[1:17:38] people to pull money from
[1:17:43] them and then you get offended so and
[1:17:47] so so everybody's welcome to support
[1:17:49] their
[1:17:52] wedding with as much as you can
[1:17:55] of course you know all the wedding
[1:17:58] needs uh but for the
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:05] reception is going to be an exclusive
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:12] reception no it's going to be
[1:18:17] exclusive
[1:18:18] no that is very dangerous what you say
[1:18:22] very
[1:18:23] dangerous oh
[1:18:28] retion I don't know if that's the right
[1:18:30] luga word exclusive means that not every
[1:18:33] body is going to be
[1:18:37] invited but those who are willing and
[1:18:39] able to support with a sum of
[1:18:47] 55,000 the friends of sh and
[1:18:51] MERS you know it doesn't matter how many
[1:18:54] there will be
[1:18:56] even if
[1:18:59] you well as long as you can pledge to
[1:19:03] support that
[1:19:07] amount you be given an invitation
[1:19:12] card only those with invitation cards
[1:19:14] will be welcome
[1:19:17] there to be at a
[1:19:20] hotel so don't embarrass yourself but by
[1:19:24] coming without an invitation
[1:19:28] C because the the hotel will have
[1:19:34] instructions um so well I know that at
[1:19:38] dvf here we don't have issues with money
[1:19:40] and
[1:19:44] suppor I do not think that we will have
[1:19:46] problems with any person
[1:19:50] here I can't afford
[1:19:53] that well it's all right
[1:19:55] you don't have to
[1:19:57] go as simple as that and it's in a good
[1:20:01] spirit not in a bad SP and I encourage
[1:20:05] every young people who want to do do it
[1:20:07] that way you are
[1:20:11] welcome because then it relieves the
[1:20:15] burden for for the young people maybe to
[1:20:17] just look at other
[1:20:20] needs make their family members to
[1:20:23] support them on other things
[1:20:26] and them if they have saved up some
[1:20:28] money to help on other
[1:20:31] things and then for them they will just
[1:20:34] focus on
[1:20:36] that and you then can support
[1:20:40] them someone said called me said well I
[1:20:43] do not I I cannot eat 55,000 in a
[1:20:49] hotel that's the wrong
[1:20:52] understanding you are doing it to
[1:20:54] support their
[1:20:56] wedding it's not you feeding
[1:20:59] yourself you can even contribute that
[1:21:02] and not even
[1:21:05] e so do we all understand
[1:21:08] that so I think there will be uh I think
[1:21:12] you're already doing some uh you're
[1:21:14] already doing how do they call it
[1:21:18] yeah yeah they're already working on
[1:21:22] that I just thought I should clarify
[1:21:24] that for
[1:21:27] everybody
[1:21:29] their I'm also their
[1:21:32] parent I need it to be
[1:21:35] understood so we shall have a team
[1:21:37] leaders meeting after the
[1:21:41] service last week we didn't meet so let
[1:21:43] us meet this
[1:21:45] week and talk a little
[1:21:48] bit but I would like to appreciate the

[1:41:25] now these are people that had had Jesus
[1:41:29] teach with him some of them had even
[1:41:33] done some Miracles at the beting of
[1:41:37] Jesus imagine but they did not have
[1:41:41] power the power to be a
[1:41:44] witness you see so now that power only
[1:41:47] comes when you receive the Holy
[1:41:50] Ghost you see these disciples were in
[1:41:53] the Church of Jesus and Jesus was their
[1:41:55] pastor but they did not have the Holy
[1:42:00] Spirit they had received right
[1:42:03] teaching they had been in the right
[1:42:05] atmosphere they had believed the right
[1:42:07] stuff they not have the
[1:42:10] power to be a
[1:42:12] witness and the power to be a witness
[1:42:15] comes by the Holy
[1:42:19] Spirit after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:42:21] upon
[1:42:22] you you are no longer the
[1:42:24] same you are now Witnesses of his
[1:42:29] resurrection and even today it is the
[1:42:32] same thing there is no woman or man has
[1:42:34] a right to say they are witnesses of the
[1:42:36] resurrection of
[1:42:40] Christ you do not have a right to say
[1:42:42] that if you are not yet filled with the
[1:42:45] Holy
[1:42:46] Ghost what you are maybe you are a
[1:42:50] Believer but you are not a witness for
[1:42:53] you to become a witness you must be
[1:42:56] filled with the Holy
[1:42:58] Spirit now in the Book of Luke chapter
[1:43:01] 24 let us take a little look at Jesus
[1:43:05] after the
[1:43:07] resurrection verse
[1:43:09] 46 he said unto them thus it is written
[1:43:14] and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and
[1:43:16] to rise from the dead the third
[1:43:22] day and that repentance and remission of
[1:43:25] sins should be preached in his name
[1:43:27] among all nations beginning at
[1:43:35] Jerusalem remember that Jesus is now
[1:43:38] speaking these words to the people he
[1:43:40] had told for three years and a
[1:43:44] half some of these people had walked
[1:43:47] close to
[1:43:48] him they had eaten with him they had
[1:43:52] moved with him
[1:43:54] they had had him teach so they knew the
[1:43:57] doctrine of
[1:43:59] Jesus and also they had apparently
[1:44:03] repented of their
[1:44:05] sins and now you know Jesus now died and
[1:44:09] rose
[1:44:10] again and now he meets with them and he
[1:44:14] tells them that repentance and remission
[1:44:16] of sins should be preached in the name
[1:44:18] of
[1:44:22] Jesus
[1:44:23] because that's how it was
[1:44:25] written it will be preached in my
[1:44:28] name un among all
[1:44:31] nations beginning at
[1:44:34] Jerusalem and now it appears as if he
[1:44:37] was telling them to go and
[1:44:40] preach he was telling because there had
[1:44:42] been
[1:44:43] Witnesses because right here on verse 48
[1:44:46] he says and ye are witnesses of these
[1:44:52] things had seen Jesus healed they had
[1:44:55] seen him cast out demons they had walked
[1:44:58] with him they had followed him and they
[1:45:00] had believed him with
[1:45:02] all some of them like Peter said I will
[1:45:05] never
[1:45:06] for but we know they went ahead and
[1:45:10] for because when they arrested Jesus
[1:45:13] they did not have staying
[1:45:16] power the power to stay and be a
[1:45:20] witness is only from the Holy Ghost
[1:45:23] if you canot get filled with the
[1:45:25] Holy what you have is intellectual
[1:45:29] faith if you do not have faith from the
[1:45:32] heart you don't have the power to be a
[1:45:36] witness what you have in you will be
[1:45:39] fear you don't have the the ability to
[1:45:42] stand before
[1:45:43] some and the
[1:45:46] confidence about what you
[1:45:49] believe and maybe some of you are like
[1:45:51] that this morning
[1:45:53] the reason is you do not have the Holy
[1:45:55] Ghost
[1:45:57] yet you know when Peter Peter was with
[1:46:00] Jesus he said others will leave you but
[1:46:03] I will never
[1:46:05] for be with you until the
[1:46:07] end even when you are dying I'll be with
[1:46:11] others can go but I will not go you know
[1:46:14] you feel like he was a man who was
[1:46:17] bold he was a man who had Faith but that
[1:46:20] was intellectual faith
[1:46:23] because when Jesus was faced with his
[1:46:27] adversary Peter came with a
[1:46:29] sword he was he meant what he
[1:46:33] said and here now he came with a sword
[1:46:36] and he cut off the ear of the man who
[1:46:39] had come to arrest Jesus and he
[1:46:42] was you see I told you I will defend you
[1:46:46] I'll fight for you and many of us
[1:46:48] Believers are like
[1:46:50] that we take things kindly
[1:46:54] we take things
[1:46:56] intellectually we Le on wisdom rather
[1:46:58] than
[1:47:00] Faith but you cannot have you cannot be
[1:47:03] a true
[1:47:05] witness you cannot have
[1:47:07] faith if you do not have the Holy Spirit
[1:47:11] in your
[1:47:12] soul you must come to a place where you
[1:47:16] open up before God where you wait at
[1:47:21] the fills you with the power of the Holy
[1:47:27] Ghost that does not happen it is only a
[1:47:31] matter of time but you will forsake
[1:47:34] Jesus because you have no power to be a
[1:47:38] witness I'm here to speak to you this
[1:47:41] morning if you don't want it there are
[1:47:44] many all over the world and even some
[1:47:47] here who are witnesses of what I'm
[1:47:49] talking
[1:47:51] about God still as
[1:47:54] witness and you know when Peter was F
[1:47:57] with
[1:47:58] adversity and then they C Jesus and he
[1:48:02] saw with his eyes them taking Jesus away
[1:48:07] and he follow to see what they would
[1:48:09] do and what how Jesus would
[1:48:12] respond when it reached a moment he felt
[1:48:15] like no I can't take
[1:48:18] this I can't
[1:48:20] die and a little girl came and told him
[1:48:24] I saw you with that man said what are
[1:48:26] you talking about I don't know what
[1:48:29] you're talking about I even never seen
[1:48:31] the man in my
[1:48:32] life this is the man who said I'll be
[1:48:35] with you until the
[1:48:37] end but he had not
[1:48:40] power friends we need
[1:48:42] power we need power tell your neighbor
[1:48:46] we need
[1:48:47] power amen power comes when you are
[1:48:51] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:48:53] and Jesus sent them he said You shall be
[1:48:56] Witnesses repentance and remission of
[1:48:59] sins shall be preached in my name among
[1:49:03] all nations beginning at Jerusalem tell
[1:49:07] them you are
[1:49:08] witnesses you saw me heal you saw me
[1:49:12] deliver you s you saw me set free the
[1:49:15] captives you saw me doing the Miracles
[1:49:18] so you will go and do the
[1:49:19] same you shall be Witnesses but he said
[1:49:23] wait before you go and behold I send you
[1:49:28] the promise of my father upon
[1:49:32] you come on help me and preach with me
[1:49:34] this morning I sent the promise of my
[1:49:36] father upon
[1:49:39] you
[1:49:44] he in the city of
[1:49:47] Jerusalem wait there wait in
[1:49:51] Jerusalem you go
[1:49:54] wait Jesus did not have confidence in
[1:49:58] them to be
[1:50:01] Witnesses until they were endued with
[1:50:05] power until he says until you be endued
[1:50:08] with power
[1:50:11] from are you hearing me this morning
[1:50:14] until you endued with
[1:50:16] power he has no confidence in you until
[1:50:20] you were endued with power you have no
[1:50:23] right to call yourself a
[1:50:25] witness until you ended with power you
[1:50:29] have no right to stand as a Believer a
[1:50:32] chrisan because you cannot be a
[1:50:35] witness you have just heard but you
[1:50:38] don't know what you're talking
[1:50:40] about it's just like those son Sons of
[1:50:44] ke who came and they were casting out
[1:50:47] demons and they say we cast you out in
[1:50:51] the name of Jesus
[1:50:53] who Paul speaks
[1:50:54] about they were just you know bring it
[1:50:57] in third
[1:50:59] person they were not they were not
[1:51:03] Witnesses and those demons listen to
[1:51:06] them and they knew the words they spoke
[1:51:09] were
[1:51:11] right but the people that spoke them
[1:51:13] were not
[1:51:15] Witnesses so you may have a right mental
[1:51:20] Faith you may even know what to
[1:51:23] believe you may even know the message
[1:51:25] from back to from from from You Know
[1:51:27] cover to
[1:51:28] cover you may have read all the
[1:51:31] Bible that does not make you a
[1:51:34] believer that does not make you a
[1:51:37] witness to be a believer you need to be
[1:51:39] a
[1:51:41] witness when they bring a witness in
[1:51:45] court it is not someone who says I
[1:51:48] heard it is someone who said I saw
[1:51:53] I
[1:51:54] witnessed you know one time you know
[1:51:57] there was the son of King David called
[1:52:02] ABS the son of King David absum you know
[1:52:05] went uh to form a revolt against his
[1:52:11] father and you know what happened that
[1:52:14] little boy as he was taking the people
[1:52:16] and they were fight there was a
[1:52:19] fight and joab the captain of David
[1:52:23] was sent by King
[1:52:24] David to go and represent him on the
[1:52:28] batt and make sure he doesn't kill his
[1:52:31] boy and so there was a a
[1:52:35] commotion and you know well absum was on
[1:52:39] on a donkey on
[1:52:41] ass and you know as he ran you know the
[1:52:44] donkey or the ass just took him straight
[1:52:46] to the branch of the
[1:52:49] tree and you know he his head was just
[1:52:54] there and you know he couldn't come out
[1:52:57] until he was killed right
[1:52:59] there there was a little man and and
[1:53:02] this man was called um what was his name
[1:53:07] Kush there was a little young man called
[1:53:10] Kush Kush heard
[1:53:12] everything Kush saw everything and he
[1:53:16] was
[1:53:17] amazed and because joab saw that kush
[1:53:21] was a witness
[1:53:23] he came to K and told him go to the king
[1:53:27] and tell him the
[1:53:29] tidings tell him what you have
[1:53:31] seen and while Kush was going to start
[1:53:35] off there came another man and his name
[1:53:38] was
[1:53:39] arimus arimas had not seen
[1:53:42] anything arimas had had the
[1:53:46] commotion he had everything that
[1:53:48] happened but he does not know for sure
[1:53:51] what exactly happened
[1:53:55] he came quickly to he
[1:54:00] said because I feel it all over me let
[1:54:03] me go and tell the king the Glad
[1:54:09] Tidings and then he said but it's not
[1:54:11] your time to go what are you going to
[1:54:14] say anyway you've not seen anything just
[1:54:18] allow me to go and then he said all
[1:54:20] right you can go he owed him to go but
[1:54:24] he actually was not a
[1:54:26] witness and there are many preachers who
[1:54:28] are preaching
[1:54:30] today but they are not
[1:54:32] Witnesses they don't know what they're
[1:54:34] talking about they even this Sunday
[1:54:37] morning many churches all over the world
[1:54:40] there are many preachers who are like
[1:54:43] arim they don't know what they are
[1:54:45] talking
[1:54:46] about they are not Witnesses of what
[1:54:49] we're talking about they are not
[1:54:51] Witnesses of his
[1:54:53] resurrection but they are preaching
[1:54:56] because they're excited because they can
[1:54:58] do some Miracles here you hear them
[1:55:01] prophesy
[1:55:03] Papa they think that you know preaching
[1:55:06] the gospel is
[1:55:07] comedy preaching the gospel is not a
[1:55:10] show preaching the gospel is not a TV
[1:55:14] show preing The Gospel is amen Bringing
[1:55:17] Down the word of
[1:55:21] God
[1:55:23] witness speaking of something you know
[1:55:26] speaking of something that is revealed
[1:55:28] to you speaking of something you have
[1:55:30] seen speaking of something you've heard
[1:55:34] and you are sure about what you're
[1:55:35] talking
[1:55:37] about and and
[1:55:39] when you know he he he didn't even while
[1:55:43] while was
[1:55:45] running on the right path on the right
[1:55:48] path oh may God send us more Cush
[1:55:53] may God send us more cushies and I'm
[1:55:56] here to tell you this morning God has
[1:55:58] sent us a cushy in
[1:56:00] this prophet of
[1:56:02] Malachi amen a true Messenger a true
[1:56:06] witness the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:56:10] he came with the word that was pointing
[1:56:12] us to Christ he heard he saw he knows
[1:56:17] what he's talking about Hallelujah am
[1:56:20] and he let the people
[1:56:22] through the path he took the message
[1:56:26] through the path but there are many
[1:56:28] others who are like Aras what didas do
[1:56:32] he didn't use the path he used a
[1:56:35] shortcut he ran through the shortcut and
[1:56:39] his running was like
[1:56:44] wind he ran so fast the Bible says that
[1:56:48] he overtook
[1:56:50] cush and he went ahead of him
[1:56:53] and he reached the king but before he
[1:56:55] reached the king you know as he was
[1:56:58] running the one that keep the the watch
[1:57:02] over over the tower they saw him running
[1:57:07] said who Could That Be who Could That Be
[1:57:10] and someone said I think that is
[1:57:15] arimus because the running is like the
[1:57:18] running
[1:57:19] of there are many people Oh Glory to God
[1:57:23] in this
[1:57:24] Christianity who are running like
[1:57:27] Aras they are running like Aras they
[1:57:30] taking a
[1:57:31] shortcut and why did he say they running
[1:57:34] like that

[2:05:31] Witnesses of Jesus
[2:05:35] Christ and he told them you cannot go
[2:05:40] wait in
[2:05:43] Jerusalem the problem that we have many
[2:05:46] people don't
[2:05:48] tell they have no confidence in God
[2:05:52] they don't trust him they don't believe
[2:05:54] he will fulfill his
[2:05:56] promise but when he told the
[2:05:59] disciples the disciples trusted
[2:06:02] him they waited for 10
[2:06:06] days they knew
[2:06:09] everything but they
[2:06:12] waited brother wait upon
[2:06:15] God because one thing I know about
[2:06:19] God God is faithful
[2:06:22] God is faithful no one can ever accuse
[2:06:26] God
[2:06:29] unfaithfulness when he gives a
[2:06:31] promise he keeps
[2:06:33] it he keeps it he fulfills it and if you
[2:06:38] trust him if you have confidence in him
[2:06:41] he will come through for you but the
[2:06:44] problem with trust in
[2:06:46] chariots We Trust in our abilities there
[2:06:49] was a man who said some trust in
[2:06:53] chariots others trust in this but I we
[2:06:57] trust in the god I will trust in the
[2:07:00] name of my
[2:07:02] God trusting Our God we not trusting our
[2:07:06] abilities in the Chariots what man has
[2:07:10] we trusting
[2:07:11] God oh it is so sweet to trust in Jesus
[2:07:17] it is so sweet because when you trust
[2:07:19] him you are confident
[2:07:22] that is going to come through for you
[2:07:24] when you have faith in him you will be
[2:07:27] called a
[2:07:28] fool when you have faith in him you be
[2:07:31] called
[2:07:33] unrealistic you be called
[2:07:36] anible the Bible says without faith it
[2:07:40] is impossible to please
[2:07:44] God do you believe he will give you the
[2:07:46] holy
[2:07:47] ghost or you do not if you believe
[2:07:52] then learn to wait on

[2:10:32] power in the same way he can do it
[2:10:36] again in the same yesterday today and
[2:10:41] forever we Are
[2:10:43] Witnesses I was not always like this but

[2:11:15] immortal you and give you a power to be
[2:11:20] a witness
[2:11:24] hallelujah hallelujah in the Book of
[2:11:27] John
[2:11:29] 15 verse
[2:11:32] 26 but when the comforter is
[2:11:36] come whom I will send unto
[2:11:42] you from the
[2:11:45] father even the spirit of
[2:11:48] Truth which
[2:11:50] proceeds
[2:11:52] from the
[2:11:55] father he shall testify of
[2:11:59] me and
[2:12:01] he also shall bear
[2:12:07] witness because ye have been with me
[2:12:10] from the
[2:12:12] beginning the disciples were called by
[2:12:15] Jesus they were separated taught and
[2:12:18] guided by
[2:12:20] him they saw and had Jesus teach and
[2:12:24] they
[2:12:26] believed they saw and had Jesus cast a
[2:12:31] demon and they themselves cast a
[2:12:34] demon in his name some of them could
[2:12:37] even cast
[2:12:38] them in his name think about it but they
[2:12:42] were not yet
[2:12:45] witnessed you can be in church for two
[2:12:47] years 3 years when you are not a
[2:12:50] witness
[2:12:52] and you will deny Jesus at your earliest
[2:12:58] opportunity did you know you as a
[2:13:02] Christian who is a
[2:13:04] witness you are a representative of the
[2:13:07] whole
[2:13:09] Chris whatever you do whatever you say
[2:13:14] you are representing the whole Church of
[2:13:17] Christ on Earth but why I believe is not
[2:13:21] able to do
[2:13:23] it because they not
[2:13:25] Witnesses we have too many church
[2:13:28] members we have very few
[2:13:31] Christians why do we have a lot of
[2:13:34] corruption even here in our country
[2:13:37] until you have a lot of young people
[2:13:39] wanting to go and join
[2:13:42] politics not because they have a heart
[2:13:45] to Ser
[2:13:46] people because they have a heart to go
[2:13:49] and steal money
[2:13:52] because they know for sure that's where
[2:13:54] the money
[2:13:55] is and they right and these are
[2:14:02] Christians the president talked
[2:14:05] to Robert you know Pastor Robert
[2:14:09] Kay and a few other pastors and he told
[2:14:13] them give me some of your good
[2:14:16] people I want to put them in in in in
[2:14:19] some institutions
[2:14:22] where I don't want corruption
[2:14:25] to put them in in
[2:14:28] tax you know revenue auth and
[2:14:32] put but what happened they brought the
[2:14:34] whole thing down quicker than even the
[2:14:39] infidels so they are
[2:14:41] Christians by
[2:14:43] name they Nom
[2:14:46] Christians they are not Witnesses but
[2:14:49] brother sisters when one time you get
[2:14:52] filled with the Holy Ghost you will
[2:14:55] realize these things of the
[2:14:58] world nothing you will have a new
[2:15:02] dream you will have a new
[2:15:05] ambition to seek after the Eternal
[2:15:09] things I don't know about you but I am
[2:15:13] seeking after my eternal
[2:15:15] Heritage I am on my way to heaven I
[2:15:20] don't care about the things of the world
[2:15:23] if God gives me that's all right if God
[2:15:26] makes me Rich that's all
[2:15:28] right and he has the ability to do
[2:15:31] that here is what I want to tell you my
[2:15:35] heart is where my treasure is and my
[2:15:39] treasures are in heaven my treasures are
[2:15:44] above when the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:47] comes in your heart you receive the
[2:15:50] honest
[2:15:53] the down
[2:15:55] payment of what is up
[2:15:58] there the Holy Ghost is not our
[2:16:04] go the Holy Ghost is the Hest of our
[2:16:10] goal our goal is to go be with
[2:16:15] Jesus but when you receive the Holy
[2:16:18] Ghost you have the power
[2:16:22] exercise everything everything that
[2:16:26] those who are in the Kingdom can do you
[2:16:29] have the the power to live a Christian
[2:16:34] Life you cannot live
[2:16:37] holy hear me now you cannot live
[2:16:41] holy if you don't have the
[2:16:44] Holy you must receive the
[2:16:47] holy in order to live
[2:16:49] holy if you think you are living holy
[2:16:53] and you don't have the Holy Ghost that
[2:16:55] is your own
[2:16:57] works and God says it is nothing before
[2:17:01] me is filthy
[2:17:03] rug but when you filled with the is his
[2:17:07] life
[2:17:09] in it is a life that no man can
[2:17:15] flow but until they receive the baptis
[2:17:17] of the Holy Ghost these
[2:17:19] people they were not your true
[2:17:23] Witnesses oh God make us
[2:17:27] Witnesses in the message Witnesses
[2:17:32] 53 and God help us to
[2:17:35] see the day that when men will be just
[2:17:38] what they
[2:17:41] are you know I say this now with all
[2:17:46] respect it isn't our city full of
[2:17:48] bootleg joints just hurting
[2:17:55] are you hearing what I say because we
[2:17:57] have too many uh you know uh some of
[2:18:01] these bootle joints
[2:18:02] or bars
[2:18:05] Orting stations
[2:18:07] or you know immoral you know BRS and
[2:18:11] things that is not what is hurting
[2:18:15] us because the world is full of
[2:18:19] sinners Liars fornicators
[2:18:23] adter murderers thieves that is not what
[2:18:27] is killing
[2:18:30] us here is what is hurting
[2:18:33] us more than
[2:18:35] ever is people who are professing to be
[2:18:39] Christians and not living like
[2:18:43] it that's the thing they are not a
[2:18:47] correct
[2:18:49] Witness
[2:18:52] they're
[2:18:54] not they can't
[2:18:56] witness until they have an
[2:19:00] experience and when they have an
[2:19:03] experience then they can become a
[2:19:07] witness automatically they
[2:19:10] become because they are born
[2:19:13] again and all of the things of the
[2:19:15] world all things have passed away and
[2:19:20] all Things become new then you become a
[2:19:24] witness unto Jesus when you receive the
[2:19:28] Holy Ghost all things are passed away
[2:19:31] tell your neighbor all things are pass
[2:19:34] away all things are passed
[2:19:36] away oh glory to
[2:19:41] God all things are passed
[2:19:44] away your desires pass
[2:19:48] away your cigarettes you throw them away
[2:19:52] you only need to ask where is the
[2:19:56] scripture just smell so bad for
[2:19:59] you because the world enjoys
[2:20:02] it that's the
[2:20:05] appetite but when you receive the Holy
[2:20:07] Ghost you receive a new
[2:20:10] appetite let me tell you when you
[2:20:13] receive the Holy Ghost you become
[2:20:16] drunk because the Holy Ghost intoxicates
[2:20:21] the ho ghost comes through you he comes
[2:20:25] in you he comes all over
[2:20:28] you the Holy Ghost takes over your mind
[2:20:32] takes over your heart takes over your
[2:20:34] soul takes over every part
[2:20:38] of until you forget who you
[2:20:42] are you forget who you are and the Bible
[2:20:45] brings it in one one phrase that says
[2:20:49] all things
[2:20:51] pass
[2:20:52] away
[2:20:53] behold all things are
[2:20:58] new they used to know you as a
[2:21:02] liar and they can't believe you
[2:21:05] now but he simply tell them just watch
[2:21:09] me I'm a new man
[2:21:13] now you go back to your
[2:21:15] friends and tell them sorry I cannot
[2:21:19] walk with you anymore
[2:21:22] why I no longer who you used to
[2:21:25] know I'm a new man
[2:21:27] now they would say no we still love you
[2:21:30] you say all right I will hang
[2:21:34] around and as long as you hang
[2:21:37] around you will infate
[2:21:40] them you will you will you will you will
[2:21:44] give
[2:21:48] them because what are
[2:21:51] doing what you used to do you are no
[2:21:54] longer
[2:21:56] doing they used to take is a social
[2:22:00] drink and you used to say it's all
[2:22:03] right remember I'm a Christian I can't
[2:22:06] take more than one it's all right and
[2:22:09] they will give you drink but brother
[2:22:13] when you f the Holy Ghost you'll be with
[2:22:15] them all right and then they will tell
[2:22:18] you as usual you tell them I'm sorry so
[2:22:22] what is happening I'm no longer what I
[2:22:25] used to be so you are a
[2:22:27] fool I'm a fool for Christ and then they
[2:22:31] will say you have lost your
[2:22:33] mind say I found my
[2:22:36] mind and they will say you are
[2:22:39] brainwashed and they will tell them if
[2:22:42] that's brainwashing I need more
[2:22:44] of they cannot keep up with
[2:22:47] you I'm saying they cannot keep up with
[2:22:50] you
[2:22:52] if the world is tagging around
[2:22:54] you there is a problem with your
[2:23:02] experience I am telling you I know what
[2:23:04] I'm talking
[2:23:06] about if the world loves
[2:23:09] you because you a kind man a kind
[2:23:14] woman but if oh my God you are the one
[2:23:17] who had
[2:23:19] sweet in their test but the moment you
[2:23:24] receive the power of the Holy Ghost let
[2:23:27] me tell you you are
[2:23:29] change and you
[2:23:31] become what we call
[2:23:34] reder they don't want to test you
[2:23:37] anymore because your taste is
[2:23:41] different your heart is drawn on things
[2:23:45] about your heart is looking about it's
[2:23:50] looking down here oh God give us more
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:24:00] witnesses Jesus knew before these
[2:24:02] Apostles could ever go out and be
[2:24:04] correct
[2:24:08] witness they had to experience what they
[2:24:12] were witnessing
[2:24:16] about wouldn't that be nice
[2:24:19] today if every Seminary did the same
[2:24:23] thing if every Christian did the same
[2:24:26] thing would just come to church and
[2:24:29] say now I'm accepting Jesus as my
[2:24:34] personal
[2:24:35] savior I am going to stay right
[2:24:38] here till I get the baptism of the Holy
[2:24:43] Spirit then I'm going to go out and be a
[2:24:48] witness but what happens
[2:24:51] you accept Christ as youri and you put a
[2:24:54] full stop to it that's just the
[2:24:57] beginning you water baptism is just the
[2:25:02] beginning you need to go all the
[2:25:04] way you need to seek the
[2:25:06] holy you need to thirst for
[2:25:09] the God cannot give you something you do
[2:25:11] not
[2:25:13] want yeah you say I want it but I don't
[2:25:16] have you do not want it you are a
[2:25:19] liar because if you want it you will
[2:25:22] come for it it's like I have this phone
[2:25:24] and you want this
[2:25:26] phone but you don't want to ask
[2:25:28] me it is because you're
[2:25:31] proud you don't want to ask and so I
[2:25:35] won't give it to you but when you come
[2:25:37] to me and say can you please give me
[2:25:39] that
[2:25:40] phone I sure it's been yours for a
[2:25:43] year but I waited for you to ask and
[2:25:47] this is how God is he doesn't give you
[2:25:49] the Holy Ghost
[2:25:51] because you're
[2:25:53] proud how many have ever gone to a
[2:25:56] fasting and prayer because you want to
[2:25:57] go
[2:25:59] to with the Holy Ghost and let me tell
[2:26:03] you if you did not get the Holy Ghost it
[2:26:07] is because you did it the wrong
[2:26:09] way you come but you've not burnt your
[2:26:16] Bridges I'm going to pray and if it
[2:26:19] doesn't work out
[2:26:21] I still go back because after all he has
[2:26:23] not
[2:26:25] fulfilled but oh be like that
[2:26:28] man was in a
[2:26:32] field him when it came to

[2:30:52] country I was determined I was
[2:30:56] focused to be filled with the Holy
[2:30:59] Ghost because I desire un
[2:31:01] hung if you love

[2:31:29] a few days fasting and praying and
[2:31:32] listening to the message reading the
[2:31:34] Bible waiting upon God and I'm telling
[2:31:37] you what he sent me an email filled with
[2:31:41] joy filled with excitement he said on
[2:31:45] the last day when I was about to give up

[2:31:51] to pray with me and then he encouraged
[2:31:54] me he told me keep on pra I I was
[2:31:58] fasting for a few days I didn't have
[2:32:01] energy but when that power came I was
[2:32:05] filled
[2:32:06] with like a
[2:32:08] giant like a giant I was so full of joy
[2:32:12] from within he said this it was so
[2:32:16] strange and yet so
[2:32:18] sweet
[2:32:20] [Applause]
[2:32:22] strange so sweet I love the feeling said
[2:32:27] every time from that moment when I begin
[2:32:30] praying I pray
[2:32:32] endlessly I pray endlessly I feel like I
[2:32:36] want to pray one
[2:32:37] second but then I feel ped I feel ped
[2:32:41] what is it the power of the when Jesus
[2:32:46] was right there on the mountain he
[2:32:48] prayed endlessly
[2:32:50] why he had the life of
[2:32:53] God when you have that life of God in
[2:32:55] you amen you will be a man of woman of
[2:33:02] prayer you can be a witness
[2:33:05] too nothing can stop
[2:33:08] you now I'm accepting
[2:33:10] Jesus as my
[2:33:13] personal I'm going to stay right
[2:33:16] there until I get the
[2:33:18] baptism the Holy Ghost and then I'm
[2:33:21] going out to be a
[2:33:23] witness things would be different don't
[2:33:26] you think
[2:33:27] so we wouldn't have that loose cuted
[2:33:34] testimonies people testify and say they
[2:33:37] are
[2:33:39] Christian and they go out and live other
[2:33:44] lives and the unbeliever comes
[2:33:48] in and sees
[2:33:50] that and he
[2:33:52] says look at
[2:33:56] them is that the way and the devil will
[2:33:59] always Point them
[2:34:03] out you can't just depend on
[2:34:07] that Devil is a
[2:34:11] buiness and don't underestimate his
[2:34:14] ability and his business
[2:34:18] room because he know knows what it's all
[2:34:22] about people walk in
[2:34:25] here they don't know what you're talking
[2:34:28] about but they've heard this is the
[2:34:31] truth preparing our for the RT and then
[2:34:35] because they
[2:34:36] know the devil knows those are not
[2:34:39] changed and so he will look at
[2:34:42] them if you're saying that this is the
[2:34:44] truth how come it did not
[2:34:47] change how come it did not change
[2:34:50] how come some say like
[2:34:52] this and you can't debate with the devil
[2:34:56] on
[2:34:59] that he
[2:35:01] knows his a business he been in for a
[2:35:03] lot of a long
[2:35:05] time now before you can be a
[2:35:08] witness as I've said you have to know
[2:35:11] something you really have to be a
[2:35:15] witness you have to know what you're
[2:35:18] talking about
[2:35:20] how many want to be
[2:35:22] witness now if you want to be a
[2:35:24] witness don't let it end on a Sunday
[2:35:29] morning after this Sunday morning you
[2:35:32] are not yet filled with the Holy
[2:35:34] Ghost him until
[2:35:37] you do something
[2:35:40] extraordinary do something you've never
[2:35:42] done
[2:35:42] before is fasting
[2:35:46] fast no longer fast
[2:35:48] even no longer thir
[2:35:52] after thir after
[2:35:55] him forget about your food for a
[2:35:59] while go in a closet
[2:36:02] somewhere
[2:36:04] pray don't pray until you're
[2:36:06] tired when you tired wait until
[2:36:10] something
[2:36:11] happen remember the moment you're about
[2:36:14] to give
[2:36:16] up that is the moment is about to come
[2:36:20] don't accept the devil to discourage
[2:36:22] you if we have young people filled with
[2:36:25] the Holy
[2:36:26] Ghost I tell you we shall change our
[2:36:29] world we will change our country we will
[2:36:33] change our
[2:36:34] continent we will change our
[2:36:37] cities because the Holy Ghost is
[2:36:42] contagious as much as the the filthy
[2:36:45] Spirits are
[2:36:48] contagious
[2:36:50] you walk close around to somebody who
[2:36:52] has a f the
[2:36:54] spirit and then it begins to come in you
[2:36:58] because you yourself are not
[2:37:01] filled but if you filled with the holy
[2:37:04] spirit let me tell you whatever you walk
[2:37:07] those demons will
[2:37:10] scream a man a woman filled with the
[2:37:14] ho is a thunder to the
[2:37:17] devil because the devil does not know
[2:37:19] what to do with
[2:37:20] you wherever you go demons are
[2:37:23] screaming you are not seeing them
[2:37:26] literally feeling them
[2:37:28] spiritually whenever you go those demons
[2:37:32] begin to
[2:37:32] scream those demons begin to scream how
[2:37:36] will you know because those people will
[2:37:39] not like
[2:37:42] you without a
[2:37:44] reason they will begin to hit you that
[2:37:47] is how Jesus was
[2:37:50] wherever he went they did not like him
[2:37:53] and one time he went around the toms of
[2:37:57] GAD and when he arrived there he was
[2:38:00] still far the demon Spirits they knew
[2:38:04] him and they began
[2:38:06] screaming have you come to take us
[2:38:09] before our
[2:38:11] time and the man was
[2:38:14] feared amen because if you have the Holy
[2:38:17] Ghost demons will
[2:38:22] Hallelujah why do you think that people
[2:38:24] will someone will come and tell
[2:38:27] you let's go to the movie
[2:38:31] theater because they know the spirit in
[2:38:34] them is the spirit in
[2:38:38] yous know each
[2:38:42] other know each
[2:38:46] other but if you're filled with the Holy
[2:38:48] Ghost
[2:38:50] brother this is the second time you're
[2:38:52] going
[2:38:53] out I will tell the to
[2:38:59] AR if you filled with the Holy
[2:39:02] Ghost you cannot someone cannot come
[2:39:13] and you're f with the Holy
[2:39:16] Ghost the moment someone tells you that

[2:47:40] the
[2:47:42] Earth with him when he sits on his
[2:47:46] throne oh let me listen to me there is a
[2:47:49] throne that Jesus is going to sit on one
[2:47:54] day and that is
[2:47:56] called The Throne of
[2:48:02] David remember he promised
[2:48:04] David an everlasting
[2:48:07] Kingdom a kingdom
[2:48:10] without that's why they were asking
[2:48:12] Jesus when he was on Earth is it the
[2:48:16] time for the kingdom to be restored
[2:48:19] you are our King that is why the Jews
[2:48:23] laid for him
[2:48:25] Palms that he walks
[2:48:28] over because they thought he had come to
[2:48:32] restore the
[2:48:33] kingdom of
[2:48:37] David and they asked
[2:48:40] him are you a
[2:48:42] king he said you have said
[2:48:47] so
[2:48:49] and then he said so you mean you're
[2:48:51] going
[2:48:52] to and he told
[2:48:55] him hallelu amen because listen at that
[2:48:59] time please open your understanding now
[2:49:03] at that time Jesus was not a son of
[2:49:10] David he was a son of
[2:49:14] man a
[2:49:16] prophet a good man
[2:49:20] and as
[2:49:21] God that time the office was in his
[2:49:26] kingdom was not of this
[2:49:28] world it was of
[2:49:31] heaven so he answered my king is not of
[2:49:35] this
[2:49:36] one but there was a
[2:49:39] confusion they also know there was a man
[2:49:43] supposed to come on the to
[2:49:47] continue the
[2:49:50] of and he was he looked like
[2:49:53] him but he didn't fulfill it that's why
[2:49:56] the Jews never believed
[2:50:00] him but they failed to
[2:50:03] understand listen they fa to understand
[2:50:08] that was just a
[2:50:11] dispensation of the
[2:50:13] same who will also fulfill the
[2:50:17] other
[2:50:19] are you following me he was also
[2:50:21] supposed to
[2:50:22] be son of
[2:50:25] DAV and Son of
[2:50:28] God so son of man started from when he
[2:50:31] started his
[2:50:34] ministry up to when he
[2:50:37] died son of man
[2:50:40] Min it was a prophet a
[2:50:43] man dying for our sin
[2:50:47] godh son of man
[2:50:49] Min
[2:50:50] Son of God was he was fulfilling son
[2:50:55] of but there was another
[2:50:58] Ministry of the same
[2:51:00] person Son of God that one
[2:51:05] started where on the day of
[2:51:09] P when he the spirit of Truth
[2:51:14] Shall he will remind
[2:51:17] everything you will be endued with
[2:51:20] power what is the
[2:51:22] power oh I feel like
[2:51:25] speaking what was the power it was the
[2:51:28] power of the Son of
[2:51:31] God Son of God
[2:51:34] ministry as the Holy
[2:51:36] Spirit and it has been going
[2:51:39] on from that time until the
[2:51:45] Rapture and when the Rapture goes
[2:51:49] and finishes there's going to be another
[2:51:53] cut
[2:51:56] open of the same
[2:51:59] Jesus now the son
