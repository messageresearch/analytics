[38:25] [Applause]
[38:26] [Music]
[38:30] i also thank everybody who prayed for me
[38:33] god answered your prayers
[38:38] amen
[38:39] thank you appreciate the lord for the
[38:40] special song
[38:43] amen
[38:44] brother isaac requested to give a
[38:46] testimony i'm just giving you one minute
[38:51] god bless you brethren
[38:53] i'm so happy today
[38:56] that i'm here testify
[38:58] for what the lord has done for me
[39:01] uh
[39:02] most of you you know about me and uh
[39:06] my story but
[39:08] what the reason why i'm here right now
[39:10] is uh
[39:12] the test one i wanted to give it last
[39:14] week
[39:15] but it was not yet
[39:17] it was not yet confirmed
[39:20] so uh
[39:21] i'm here to tell you the last time after
[39:24] i came back
[39:25] i didn't have a job but when i come here
[39:29] we prayed
[39:31] right now i feel i couldn't believe it
[39:34] because
[39:35] we're invited for interviews
[39:38] and
[39:40] where i thought of 147 apricans
[39:44] but of all those i
[39:47] imagined the first one and i was given
[39:50] the job
[39:55] uh
[39:56] the job i didn't expect it but uh
[40:00] it's how the lord
[40:02] turns things which seems impossible he
[40:04] makes them possible
[40:06] yeah because
[40:08] this job is would have been for people
[40:10] who are highly educated
[40:13] because uh it's a u.s company that i got
[40:17] a job from
[40:18] as a technical recruiter
[40:22] and uh
[40:24] even that the money or the salary that i
[40:28] were getting the other side
[40:30] uh when we had to compare this one is
[40:32] even much
[40:34] than what i was earning
[40:36] outside
[40:38] so
[40:39] i'm very happy and uh i wouldn't i can't
[40:42] fail to thank god for
[40:44] this miracle it's indeed the miracle
[40:47] and may god richly bless you
[40:52] amen
[40:54] we thank god for that testimony
[40:56] brother joelle had requested you to do
[40:58] me something but
[41:00] uh

[41:04] time to fellowship with us

[57:12] we didn't have chairs situational tv but
[57:14] the team with his own money bought all
[57:17] the chairs for the first challenge

[57:42] at one point he offered me and my wife
[57:44] to even
[57:45] because his house was big it had

[1:11:40] brother bus is just like me
[1:11:44] we don't want no organization supporting
[1:11:47] us
[1:11:50] because brother branham was the same way
[1:12:19] that god is called men of god
[1:12:23] to a backside of the desert experience
[1:12:29] men that have gone through trials
[1:12:33] men that don't have it all together

[1:13:13] though
[1:13:14] immediately
[1:13:16] if you wanna
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:41] because i believe god can speak the same
[1:13:43] word in softness
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:13] lord god but i'm more than that i'm a
[1:14:15] son of god
[1:14:18] i have to have my own experience
[1:14:22] but i pray for your heart that would be
[1:14:23] here today
[1:14:26] what
[1:14:36] [Music]
[1:14:52] is the pure word of god
[1:15:14] [Music]
[1:15:22] and they go out of churches
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:35] if you have the desire for god to give
[1:15:37] you mercy
[1:15:39] why don't you just lift up your hands
[1:15:42] why don't you just surrender right now
[1:15:44] wait wait
[1:15:45] why don't you say lord speak to me guys
[1:15:50] lord
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:31] see jesus
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:12] reality
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:27] to
[1:17:29] be like jesus
[1:17:34] oh on earth i
[1:17:37] love
[1:17:40] to
[1:17:41] be
[1:17:42] like
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:55] from earth
[1:18:03] i
[1:18:04] only
[1:18:05] asked
[1:18:08] to
[1:18:09] be
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:15] oh man how many have that desire
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:19] and this
[1:18:21] morning let's just hear from our
[1:18:22] theophany
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:52] let's
[1:19:15] [Music]
[1:19:34] and then my next pastor was ron peterson
[1:19:38] peterson and then my next pastor was ed
[1:19:40] bischo again
[1:19:43] school and then my next pastor was
[1:19:45] brother peter ivan
[1:19:48] and now we have our seventh pastor
[1:19:51] brother john anderson
[1:19:55] all of those men
[1:19:57] will leave the message today
[1:20:00] praise god
[1:20:02] so the message
[1:20:21] and he gave some apostles and prophets
[1:20:24] and some evangelists
[1:20:26] and some pastors and teachers
[1:20:44] to you as a gift
[1:20:47] i want to say
[1:20:49] accept the gift
[1:20:52] accept all that god has for you
[1:20:56] amen let's continue reading verse 12.
[1:21:00] why did these ministers come
[1:21:04] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:21:06] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:21:09] the body of christ
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:22:08] because ministry is not supposed to
[1:22:10] preach against people
[1:22:15] ministries should not uh speak against a
[1:22:17] circumstance or uh something that's
[1:22:19] happening in the church
[1:22:50] until
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:28] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:23:31] unto
[1:23:32] unto
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:24:01] see the problem is when you ask a
[1:24:03] minister if he makes a mistake
[1:24:07] in his personal life
[1:24:11] you notice how hard he'll get
[1:24:13] hard how hard he will get
[1:24:15] oh it is
[1:24:18] i'm going to tell you what
[1:24:19] that minister is dealing with or any of
[1:24:21] you are dealing with
[1:24:23] what you're dealing with
[1:24:25] any minister that is like that or a
[1:24:27] person that is like that where they
[1:24:28] harden their hearts
[1:24:37] they have pride
[1:24:40] how many want to be proud
[1:24:42] of
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:09] when you've received great revelation
[1:25:18] so this morning we want to speak on our
[1:25:20] christ-centered absolutely
[1:25:40] write it down she wondering
[1:25:42] and come talk to me afterwards
[1:25:46] so what i took from that under that
[1:25:48] ministry
[1:25:50] was that it's important to take notes in
[1:25:52] church
[1:25:57] because a lot of people are just
[1:25:59] listening to the message
[1:26:02] and they don't even absorb it into their
[1:26:04] hearts
[1:26:16] do you want your children to have the
[1:26:17] life of jesus christ in them
[1:26:34] a living word
[1:27:44] that
[1:28:26] you cannot understand
[1:28:52] the imbalance is when we make this
[1:28:54] greater than the bible
[1:29:00] if you're taking notes
[1:29:04] this message that i'm going to preach
[1:29:07] came from 1962.
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:13] 12 30 m
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:20] and it was called the absolutely
[1:29:25] see the problem is people preach their
[1:29:27] own doctrines
[1:29:31] and brother peter you know where they
[1:29:32] got their message from
[1:29:36] google
[1:29:39] what's the five things denominations are
[1:29:41] preaching about right now
[1:29:45] brother tim anders has never gotten a
[1:29:47] message from the google canada team andy
[1:29:50] stage
[1:30:01] [Applause]
[1:30:32] preaching on another jesus
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:38] [Applause]
[1:30:39] but see people worship their pastors
[1:30:43] they worship him
[1:30:45] they make him god
[1:31:28] if a person tells you
[1:31:30] it's okay to cut your hair
[1:31:37] this is the message that brother branham
[1:31:39] preached
[1:31:41] ministry today the bride
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:59] will we have a big congregation
[1:32:02] in it never
[1:32:04] okay
[1:32:09] because what we have in the message
[1:32:22] hallelujah
[1:33:07] i am here to make a message
[1:33:10] i am here to lift up the message
[1:33:12] i'm here to lift up jesus
[1:33:18] see we have an hour we had an hour and a
[1:33:20] half of music
[1:34:30] the prophet
[1:34:43] and we preach the message
[1:34:52] is not going to churches that are having
[1:34:54] hundreds of baptisms
[1:34:59] i'm not going to churches
[1:35:00] this is a citadel mechanism that are
[1:35:03] having hundreds of people baptized
[1:35:08] now listen very carefully
[1:35:11] baptism is an important
[1:35:52] and i said where are the people you
[1:35:53] baptized
[1:36:04] [Music]
[1:36:20] we're having this huge sweeping revival
[1:36:22] in uganda
[1:36:50] they want to take
[1:37:06] and that's to give all glory to jesus
[1:37:08] christ amen
[1:37:11] amen
[1:37:12] hallelujah
[1:37:14] just like a brother timothy could stand
[1:37:15] here
[1:37:17] when it seems brother bus is lifting him
[1:37:19] up
[1:37:23] brother is not lifting up him he's
[1:37:24] lifting up
[1:37:27] timothy
[1:37:29] we're lifting up jesus in the brothers
[1:37:33] [Music]
[1:37:46] is
[1:37:58] if we compromise on the word of god
[1:38:12] only the true believer will stay
[1:38:42] from
[1:38:56] this brother gave a testimony that god
[1:38:57] provided a job
[1:39:03] what if this brother though in his hour
[1:39:05] of need
[1:39:08] had texted me and 15 other
[1:39:11] americans
[1:39:20] then he would have replaced
[1:39:22] jehovah jireh our young
[1:39:49] god gave him a greater job
[1:40:20] you need to stop
[1:40:47] must be set by god
[1:42:11] if you're cheating on your wife
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:44:04] if i
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:33] prophet
[1:44:42] so brother joseph is part of the
[1:44:43] faithful ministry
[1:45:00] brothers
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:54] but have somewhere that you go to church
[1:46:09] somewhere you support the
[1:46:21] but don't never
[1:46:23] disfellowship
[1:46:24] the
[1:47:28] [Applause]
[1:48:43] that is causing disunity
[1:49:26] what do i need to do brother jim if i
[1:49:28] have hey
[1:49:30] repent
[1:49:34] it's done we're winning it when you
[1:49:36] repent we're winning
[1:49:39] but you might have to email them now
[1:49:54] and when that
[1:50:07] how many believe this is there
[1:50:08] absolutely
[1:50:49] and see if he has the same purpose in
[1:50:51] his heart
[1:50:58] you got fellowship
[1:51:01] one with another we're not women
[1:51:03] when when will you have that fellowship
[1:51:07] when you discern his spirits
[1:51:14] when brother tim sits over here and i
[1:51:16] listen to a minister
[1:51:18] when brother tim sits over there oh look
[1:51:20] on the team but nevertheless and i
[1:51:22] listened to a minister
[1:51:25] or anywhere in the church
[1:51:31] i
[1:51:33] it i'm looking at his spirit
[1:51:37] i'm looking at what his motive and
