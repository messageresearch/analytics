[Music] so we are taking vers 9 to vers 13 everybody there if you there just say Amen and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I he myself [Music] and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should not shouldest not [Music] eat and the man said the woman whom thou Gest to me who whom excuse me whom thou Gest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beged me and I did [Music] it did you see that I I I hope that all of us followed Adam heard the voice of God in the garden and he was afraid because he was naked so he hid himself and then when God came to Adam he said what is this that you have done and Adam said it is the woman who you gave to me to be with me she gave me of the tree and I ate and so the Lord came to the woman now what is this that you have done it is not me also it is the serpent which beg me praise God so no one accepted responsibility each of them blame the other brother did you hear what I just read each of them blame the other so it was a Blame Game and I'm speaking on the blame game tonight you may be SE hallelu so you have to get all the synonyms in luganda praise God how I happy to be here tonight the brothers that at this side I'm requesting all of you to come brother brother I think one Deon is enough in the back the others can all come this side on Wednesday when everybody is not here we could I can't see if you're beyond the pillar I can't see you so it's better you are this side then you can be able to see one another properly praise God maybe brother Marin if you want to use the okay so um I wanted to also bring uh greetings from Sister Dina to you she told me that uh to tell to let you inform you that she arrived well in Boston and thank you for your prayers we had some good time before uh on Sunday uh after the service Sunday myself brother brother Henry Brother Martin and also brother Dixon we went over at her house and we were able to find uh also her two [Music] daughters her two daughters heard about how many friends yeah like four friends so uh who who are all my girls they done with campass and God gave us an opportunity to share the this message and uh they were all happy they all confessed that they learned new things and about two three desire to hear more of this so I pray for them that uh God would give us another opportunity with them so that we can continue to share share this message with them praise the Lord amen and so to to today I'm speaking on I don't know whether I will get done but I'm going to be a bit fast because I have a lot to cover on this subject and I don't desire to break it into another service so just stay with me and be here with all your mind all your heart be here physically and if you're streaming also don't allow anything to distra praise God blame so here is Adam and Eve and because when God created Adam he created Adam and gave him dominion over the everything that was on Earth but Adam was you remember when God created Adam and Adam within Adam was Eve because it says he created male and female and yet he had cre one man of God so you see God just like God God is is many in [Music] one God is is much God is not one like your finger is [Music] one and yet there are not more than one God is one God but in him there are many attributes and so we notice that the same way he was the same nature that he was he also created man and later on he comes and takes um in Genesis 2 he makes man to sleep he takes the woman out of the man by taking out of the ribs and he uh molded Man Out of the Dust of the ground and then he breathed in him the breath of life and the Bible says Man became a living soul but but then we see that after that when he when when he took man to sleep then out of him out of the rib he made a woman and then there was a woman and a man but when Adam saw the woman he said Bor of my BS Flesh of My Flesh shall be called a woman a woman means a part of the man praise God and so uh later on the woman gets another name called Eve and Eve does not mean part of a man but means mother of all living this was after sin had come in and yet Adam was a Son of God so here you have Adam and Eve after sin When sin came into the world so you now have Adam and Eve Son of God and mother of all living what does that mean you see I've spoken that before here when when when Eve fell had a right to leave her alone and Adam would not have fallen into the same sin you know in the book of First Timothy Chapter 2 I think verse 11 there the Bible says the woman was in the transgression why because when the serpent came to the woman the woman you know gave herself she accepted to be beged and when that happened had been introduced into the human race but if Adam had not of that same sin you know Eve would be destroyed butam would remain you see brother bam said Adam knew what he was doing because you see he knew Adam somehow by Revelation he knew about the law of redemption because he knew that the woman was a born of his b but he also knew that Adam was a born of Bones of God just like in the New Testament it says that that Christ is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman and we know that our Prophet also tells us that the the men the husbands will be answerable to their for their wives but the women will not but the men will have to answer for how they treated them what they let them do because you see the man is the is the head of the the man gives both spiritual leadership in the in the and also family leadership as a man you are the head of the home you are supposed to bring the nature of Christ because Christ is also your head and then Christ leads you and you lead your family with the leadership of Christ and so we see that you know man man man also partt of this and the Bible says if the woman gave to the man and together they did it so the man fell but why did the man do that because he knew that this was the only way of redeeming his wife watch when God comes down he does not say Adam and Eve where are you but he says Adam where are you because by calling Eve was called was a part of Adam and if Adam was a sinner andam Eve was a sinner if Adam was to be redeemed Eve was to be redeemed so when Jesus Christ came down to redeem Fallen man he redeemed all Al everything else that was Fallen with man are you following me but now I I don't want to just talk about that story I just want to take a different direction tonight and I want to speak on the blame game I want to bring it out of the Book of Genesis by God's grace bring it down to us today so we see that when when when when Adam now had sinned when you know God gave his word to ad he never gave it to Eve he gave it Adam was responsible 100% responsible the way that word was treated so when God came down he did not ask if he asked Adam he says Adam where are you and he says I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told you that you were naked Adam and Eve now we naked so the question is is see nakedness his nakedness [Music] sin what is sin they were already naked before they sin if if you already knew that say amened before they but they were innocent and the devil came and took away their inoc revealing their nakedness and the word speaks of the nakedness in the end time and I want while I'm starting here while trying to to lay this foundation for you I want to uh read um this is a very good message the power of transformation if you can take it up find it and read it but I'm going to read about three paragraphs there I want you to listen to this he says now if you will turn if you wish to write down Revelation the third chapter the Holy Spirit predicting this last agean Pentecostal Church in the last days he said you are naked and blind and don't know it now he says there is God seed there is God seed [Music] seed innocence not knowing at all they were naked under a veil of the Holy Spirit veiling them from sin so here is Adam and Eve before they fell they were veiled with a veil of Innocence veil of the Holy Spirit and they were naked and they didn't know they were but it was the veil of the Holy Spirit are you following me now and he says now in the last age we find here that they are naked again and they don't know it again but it is not the Holy Spirit Veil it is the veil that Satan SLE over Eve back there a ve of last the last Veil they are so filthy till they don't know that they are naked women on the street with shorts on sexy dresses so when you see the generation we are living in When sin came into the world the devil veiled us again with a veil of nakedness but this is filth and the Bible says brother says here that they are naked and they don't know was it yesterday one of the days I went somewhere with my wife and we were SE somewhere and uh it was cold really raining a lot and then there came several several women also and there were dressed in skimpy Scots just above around the level of their thighs and so several of the of the women so my wife commented she said to me the devil has blinded them and is making them suffer they can't they can't even understand is cold and they need to cover themselves up they feel the coldness but they are blinded they are blinded to think that this and so they go out dressed that way sincerely speaking these days when you see some of them walking on the streets sometimes you may think you are dreaming things that are supposed to be dressed in the bedroom in the actually dressing it and walking on the streets and that's why we should feel so sorry for the young younger generation the generation that is actually growing or raising now it's it's going it's facing a a a huge level of difficulty because imagine a young child growing up seeing this kind of thing and then by the time they become of age they feel it is okay to dress that way you know and not until if they seed of God they hear the word of God now the word of God will reveal to them their nakedness and that's why we should preach the word regard and that is why we should never compromise on the word we should not preach to bring to make people comfortable we should preach to make people realize their wrongs and change because the devil has blinded them the devil Sur blinded them and so in the beginning man was naked but you see he was naked with innocence he did not know and then when the devil came down he took away that innocence and man realized they naked but today since that time man has been naked naked with Fields naked on the streets you know and the devil has blinded their eyes they can't realize they naked they need they need the word to show them that they are naked you sisters you can see the big difference between you and the women on the street and let me tell you there is a difference there must be a difference between a Christian and a nonbeliever in the way they dress because the way you dress shows who you are on the inside but you see uh the when when when man when when when sin came into the world then came God and he asked Adam what is this that you have done and here is my sermon tonight Adam did not accept what he did Adam refused to accept he said it's not me God said what have you done it's the woman not me sincerely was it the woman no was it the woman you may say what the woman seduced him but he was responsible for his actions each individual is responsible for his actions but Adam never [Music] owned responsibility the woman me I'm I'm I I I did not mean to do it the is the woman and then God said okay he went to the woman woman what is this that you have done me it was not me it's not me it is the serpent well you may say the serpent was the culprit because yes the Bible says the serpent be but by the there is something I want you to see here that is true the Ser Eve but Eve had to own her actions she was responsible for what she did with her mind she was responsible for what she did with her body you in the same way are responsible tell your neighbor you are responsible you cannot say someone else is you are responsible 100% responsible if say is the Ser but let me ask you a question do you see anywhere in the in the scripture here where thought comes to the serent and says what is this that you have done why because the serpent is not a human being a serpent serpent was a beast and I told you there is one thing you can look it up I preached on that the power of free moral agen there is one thing that God has given only the human race has not given it to any Beast he has not given it to any other animal any other bir of fish he has given it to you who is listening to me today and that is the power of free moral agent the power to make a decision you cannot blame anyone for what you have done or what has happened to you you and you alone have that power over your life the devil cannot be blamed many people come and say I'm sorry the devil tempted me that is what exactly Eve said that the serpent temped me the Ser no God was looking for something here can you accept [Music] responsibility do you know who you are if the church knows who she is she will accept her resp responsibility we have a responsibility to this word the way we live the things we do after we have known the truth we are directly responsible before God but what do human beings do human beings play the blame game how many think about it how many times have you thought that you are the way you are because of somebody if it wasn't for for that person I would have been [Applause] better if it wasn't for so and so I would have done better that is wrong don't blame anyone for your condition brother B in the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness there is something I'm trying to come to him if you can diligently follow me he says I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Bram this is him saying to himself he's the only one that gets in God's way so I can say the greatest enemy I have is can you speak your greatest enemy your greatest enemy is the devil some of you are even not accepting because you like how can I be my greatest I love myself our Prophet said he was his greatest enemy he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shows God right out of the picture there is nothing you can do of yourself and for yourself when Jesus was here on Earth if you will realize it Jesus knew who his greatest enemy was he knew if he would even try to lift himself up he will not accomplish the mission why he came on Earth Jesus had to Humble himself even when he was God himself in flesh Jesus realized without God he can do nothing but many times we think we are something oh if I had money I would do this oh if I had power I would do this listen you can do you can accomplish nothing on your own Adam could accomplish nothing on his own he needed a supernatural power we all need a supernatural power we cannot accomplish anything on our own so if you get to a place where you think you can do something about your situation you know me I'm intelligent I will make it you know me I have money I will make it you know I'm educated I will make it there is nothing you can accom on your own you need something to rely on you need a power to depend on that is the power of God and here says when I can get rid of that guy if I can get rid of when I can get to a place that he is out of the way then God can come over and do things William Bram knows nothing about that is humility Up Is Down Down is up if you want to get anywhere in this life humble yourself if you cannot humble yourself you will never get anywhere nothing can take you anywhere humility is key and he says that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when he get when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot oh perfect strength is in perfect weakness friends you need to realize that you are nothing by yourself and the greatest enemy that you have is [Music] yourself I am my greatest enemy many times people sit there and they think about how much people some HS me about and then begin to be angry and then many of them even get cancers out many of them get depression and then so and so comes he me what is that you are so full of yourself you think you know everything you think you you you are better than anybody and everybody and that is your greatest enemy Christianity is accepting you nothing is accepting to humble [Music] yourself there is something I'm trying to come to tonight by God's grace and if he allows us I believe it will be a blessing to all of us we all need to Humble ourselves we need to come to a place of total surrender and realizing that there is someone bigger and great than all of us hallelujah that's the problem that Adam had and Eve they were so full of themselves Adam God said Adam what is this that you have done God me me I know myself me is the woman you not it cannot be me me no no way no way Adam refused at the same time Adam was hiding himself at the same time Adam was covering himself with he leaves because he had a voice in his knew he needed something knew he had fallen but Adam was losing something there is something he did not have and that was conviction and I'm going to come and talk about that tonight many Christians don't have conviction and that's why they live in sin and can even manage to come and be in church when it came to what have you done really me cannot be I'll have you know it is Ser do you realize that serpent has no will Mr serpent was only walking in the garden that day and the next thing Mr serpent realized was the devil the real serent came and and Mr serpent realized he had more greater abilities he received the Revelation he had not received before and the devil told see that is a woman Ser do you know that you can have a child do you know do Mr serpent was a victim of the [Music] circumstance that's why what have you done time with that Ser was not Satan was a beast you have to understand was a beast like creature just almost like you and me it was a victim of circumstances and here is human being with the power of free moral AG blaming such a creature what a shame Eve had to own up for Action had to do the same that's why when it came to serpent God never wasted time he only said you I'm going to take you and break every B and you will begin eating that and walking on your bed praise God listen Adam had a different opinion he thought the problem was Eve Eve thought it was Adam they failed to realize that as long as they did not know what the problem was they could not know amen they could not know whether they needed help or not listen if you oh my God are you listening to me church if you don't know what the problem [Music] is you will not know whether you need help you will not even know what kind of help you need you will not even know how to be helped or even who to help you but when you realize where the problem is you will humble yourself and you will ask for but here is Adam and Eve because they did not know what the problem was they hid themselves did they come running back to god father father we have SE no they hi themselves why they had no [Music] conviction all they had was blaming one another imagine ad and Eve in theard ofen hiding themselves in the thi which is the type of their denomination each of them was blaming the other but if you are the one who no let me tell you let me tell you know what talking Mr Man let me tell you God gave you the word you to guide me why didn't you why didn't you tell me it was wrong no but when you came to me it was already done no but but but also you accepted when I came also you you you no you you you no you you everybody was saying you while they were doing that they were hiding themselves playing their blame game and the whole time God was not there amen the moment the devil gets you to that place God will not be there you die in your sin God is not there but when you realize what the problem is you cry out for says father I need you let's talk a little bit about the absence of conviction now due to lack of due to lack of failure to admit one's sin that that causes lack of you cannot sit down there and selfle you are just playing the blame game and anybody who plays the blame game can never be convicted of sin we have them many times in meetings and even some of you who are may be following online you might have experienced or you here and you sit with the people and everybody tells them but you are wrong you are the one is wrong and he says when he can't have any more words says okay if I'm wrong if I am wrong which means I don't have a revelation I am wrong you think I am wrong no I'm sorry that's not true repentance that's not true repentance and that is why Adam hid himself away from God conviction will bring you to God not let us take little time to learn about there in the Book of John 16:8 the Bible says and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment [Music] and in the Amplified it says when he comes meaning the Holy Spirit he will convict the world about the guil of sin praise God when the Holy Spirit friends we need the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit comes in your life convicts you of sin that's when you'll find someone who you did not tell that they were wrong but they will come to you by themselves I have had a few come in my life and they did things that I didn't even have an idea that they did to me and they come and say you know I'm sorry I did this and this and this what was that that was conviction when the Holy Ghost oh praise God when the Holy Ghost comes in your soul he will bring [Music] conviction now I was reading and I fell my eyes fell on this article which I felt I really needed to read it all for listen very good words he says to help you to help us understand what the what conviction of sin is we can look at what it is not first conviction is not simply a guilty conscience or even [Music] shame so and seen have done this m when you catch people stealing red-handed they'll say I'm sorry not what you think I'm sorry I'm really sorry I am really sorry is that out of conviction that's just a guilty conscience such feelings are naturally experienced by almost everyone everyone whether Christians or not when you steal you feel bad when you do something bad you feel bad even if no one has seen you it is a feeling but it is not conviction but this is not true conviction because you continue still in that se you do it and you to do it and you to do it but time you do it you feel bad so you cannot say it is conviction you just have a bad feeling because you did something bad just like Adam went there and he ran away because he felt bad but he was not convicted second conviction of sin is not a sense of fear of [Music] divine if I've done this I don't know is going to take me to hell those feelings to are commonly experienced in the hearts and minds of sinners one time when I called a thief that stole from me I asked him a question he was in police custody I asked him a question don't you feel bad about what you do he said I really feel that was not conviction right it was just a fear of of judgment and and Punishment because he was the police's hands he wanted me to forgive him so he can come out and then continue from where he stopped you find here we have more Justice in Uganda they put tires on them and then when they doing that the man is very busy saying forgive me forgive on and very saying let us beat him let us let us him let us please if you have a faint heart you see such a person you can't eat for a week because it is so Dreadful and you think the people forgive him because the man is convicted the man is not convicted even as soon as they releasee him that very night will are demons and they need conviction before they can repent but again true conviction is is of sin is of sin true conviction of sin rather is something different thirdly let us see the third thing that it is not conviction of sin is not merely knowledge of right and wrong it is not an acceptance to scriptures teaching about Sin many people read the Bible and are fully aware that the wages of sin is death yet for all their knowledge they continue to live in sin they understand the consequences but they are far from being convicted of their sin someone tells you I know fornication is wrong I know us will go in Hell Fire I know those things are wrong I know the Bible but doesn't mean that they convicted they to live in sin matter of fact most people who are sinners the best Sinners that we have in the world today they know the Bible almost from cover to cover so that's why on Sunday preached on the power of the r word because you can know the L word and still remain a sinner but when that power Hallelujah that power of the Holy Ghost that amen that is behind this word amen the power that WR this word the power that raised up Christ from the dead when he comes in your life when you are living in sin he brings conviction to you and some you feel you cannot continue in that [Applause] [Music] lifestyle the truth is if we experience nothing more than a p of conscience if we experience nothing more than if we just experience a p of conscious I'm doing something wrong aniy at the thought of judgment I'm going to go to hell Jud anic awareness of H then we have Gody then he says then we have never truly known the conviction of sin if the level you are at in your life is only to feel in your conscience oh I've done something wrong and then you feel anxious oh I might be judged or to just know what amen those who go to hell what they do and you are on that level only then you have never known what true conviction of sin is question is what is the real [Music] conviction kind that the Bible speaks about the word convict is a translation of the Greek word elen means to convince someone of the truth to reprove to accuse to refute to cross examine a witness you know you take that witness cross examine him you refute him and accuse him and then you convince him that he is wrong you convince him that he is wrong and you are right you convince him that he is wrong and he come to that place whereby he feels his judg even before the judgment is [Music] passed now the Holy Spirit as a persecuting who exposes evil he expose oh when when he comes in your life he he begins to expose all the evil in your life and he reproves you and he convinces you that you need a savior when when he comes in your life he convinces you that there is something else that you need in your life to be able to come out of your lifestyle the Holy Spirit reproves you the Holy Spirit convinces you of sin no one is there he is there to convince you I've seen a few people in the ministry over the past you know 15 16 years I [Music] preached people who are really convicted you tell them no it's all right you're fine no no I know what I've done I I don't want to live this I just want God to change me I need something these people let me tell you if you have ever received a conviction in your life it is a treasure don't disregard it work on it because conviction brings through repentance whereby if you are a liar you will be convicted of lies and that demon of Lies will be exposed you feel oh God I need a change whereby if you have been living Immortal he convinces you he convinces you right where you that you need to come to a place you need to put yourself right you need to run to a savior you need to receive the Holy Ghost he he convinces [Music] you and then you break down and you arrive at that place of conviction and only and only then can you be saved let me tell you it is very unfortunate but we have many amen Christians going church Christians professing Christians that are not really convicted [Music] of you are right with it you continuing normally you just feel a little conscious that tells you you are wrong and he say what if happens but then you continue right on but let me tell you one day when you receive conviction that will be the beginning of your deliverance when you receive conviction in your soul amen he will come and convince you of sin and then you will receive true and genuine Holy Ghost repentance to be convicted is to feel the sheer lomness of sin feel hatred of you it you had the thing you like given this cigarettes I no longer love them it's not just out of your mind it is out of conviction amen being convinced by the Holy Ghost this happens when we've seen God's Beauty his Purity his Holiness and when you recognize that sin canot dwell with him when Isaiah stood in the presence of God he was immediately overwhelmed by his own sinfulness Isaiah a prophet he stood right there in the presence of God and even he could not say good he could not play the blame game anymore he came to a place where he realized I'm a sinner I need a change he said why to me I am ruined I am a man of unlean lips who told him all this the Holy Ghost convinced him of the Holy Ghost exposed his sin and he says I'm a man of unclean lips eyes have seen the king the Lord Almighty he was convicted and because of that at that moment right at that moment the Bible says then God sent down an angel and this angel came amen with fire that amen that he got out of the presence of God and he came and touched his lips he touched his lips and from that moment the man was a new man in a moment he was a new man when you oh glory to God when you are convicted if you're a liar and you convicted if a fornicator and you convicted if you a thief and there is no big thief or small Thief a thief is a thief if you're a thief and you're convicted if you're last fo and you're convicted you are going to come to this place whereby you will cry out to him not out of fear of hell but out of what the Holy Spirit has re and out of being in the presence and seeing the beauty of the Cross and seeing the Holiness of God oh how can I be like this in the presence of a holy ghost how can I dwell like this and then to cause you to cry out like Isaiah and you know what you will receive the Holy Ghost right there to be convicted is to experience and dreadfulness of sin our attitude toward [Music] sin becomes at this PO moment uh Point like the one that Joseph had J fled Temptation crying out how can I do this great evil and sin against God that's conviction imagine Joseph he was in a place where no man was there he could have gone with that woman and no one would ever find but right in his he [Music] dreaded he wased he said how can I how can I do this thing how how can I do this great evil against go do you realize we have an allseeing eye watching you and when you sin you don't sin against yourself you don't sin against your wife you don't sin against your brother you don't even sin against the church as such you against you know Don't Preach like this but the holy spirit is dealing with you you better open up your [Music] heart you see God doesn't bring something for for not for nothing so you see when you're convicted of of that sin you be like how can I sin against you can't even entertain the thought in your mind said no no no Joseph the woman was all over and Joseph just ran away and the woman teared his CLS and removed took a piece of Joseph's and she said he tried to rap me God loves such [Music] cases the spirit love such cases when the devil tries to Blackmail you if the devil tries to Blackmail you when you've been living right with the word that's those are the battles that God [Music] loves God loves fighting for his children praise God brother pet you have to work on the audio you know the devil likes you know fighting against the children of God that way but you know what church the devil likes it but God loves it God loves it more because the devil used it against the man of God but guess what God used it to lift up the man of God he that was in prison became he that became on [Music] top when you are convicted of sin don't worry about the planning of the enemy to Blackmail you just put yourself right with God and we are convicted when we become mindful of how much our sin dishonors God when David was convicted by the Holy Spirit he cried out against you you only have I sin and done what is evil in your sight David saw his sin primarily as an AFR or offense to [Applause] Holy H when we are convicted we become intensely aware of the Wrath it exposes to our Souls praise God working I think it is oh yeah so listen to me church when we are convicted we become intensely aware of the Wrath it exposes to our souls that it exposes to our souls are you following me now when the Philippian jail fell at the apostles feet and he cried says what must I do to be safe he was under conviction he was certain that without a savior he would die when the Holy Ghost convicts people of their sin he represents the righteous Judgment of God there is no appeal of the verdict you feel oh I am undone isah said me said ohed man I said let me Len to me when you receive conviction feel is done you rightous judge and you need Grace the Holy Spirit not only convict people of sin but he also brings them to repentance when you are convicted by the Holy Ghost of sin he brings you to repentance Hallelujah if you being a liar a good liar liar the day you are convicted about it you will repent of [Music] it you turn around from sin you turn you give it your back you can never do that thing again because you hate it from the bottom of your soul soul you repent repentance means to turn around to it the convicting power of the holy spirit opens our eyes to our sin and opens our hearts to receive God's grace if someone is convicted of sin even if they have been a murderer they will accept God's grace why because they will understand it's not a physical thing talking about a spiritual thing here done by the power of the Holy Spirit if you had hatred I can preach about against hatred here on theit but if you're not convicted in your soul you will go right on and still and God will not and you will not receive the Revelation about it but when God convicts you of it he will begin to show you everybody that you've been hating and from that moment you will repent from that moment they'll become your friends from that moment you will say I forgive them if you have to call them up you will call them up if you have to F them you will F them whatever you need to do you will do it because the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you what you need to put right repentance and conviction is a work of the holy spirit it's not something you work up it's not something a push to do it is something the Holy Spirit reveals to you if you have been doing rumor mongering you know you will not realize is wrong when the Holy Spirit comes down amen and he makes it known to you he will just repent of it it will no longer be a part of your life we praise the Lord for the conviction of sin without it there could be no salvation no one is saved apart from the spirit is convicting and regenerating work in the heart the Bible teaches that all people are by Nature Rebels against God we dead in our trespass Jesus said no one can come to me unless the father has drawn him and part of that drawing is to convict praise God and today I took my time to explain what conviction is I want to say we all need a conviction whereby you will be convicted of sin and repent of your sin not just be a church member and the Rapture happens and you remain here this is one of the reasons why people will not go in the Rapture because they are not saved you cannot be saved without conviction you just the blame games all the time you feel like your condition is that way because of somebody's something that have done but says the message believest thou this when your pastor prays for you you say well he must not be a man of God would have his prayer have heard his prayer why did I get healed and then brother says what about your faith it is your faith that touches God not all together his prayer you are obeying God's word and when you obey God's word is under obligation to answer you if you believe him it lays in you don't blame the other man don't blame the other man oh if the pastor was a man of God God would have answered his prayer oh I think even the problem is our church don't enough or maybe we don't sing enough preach well enough listen you don't need to do blame games God what we need is a conviction of sin Hallelujah in the message God provided way brother bam says then how can you blame God you can't some of you blame God oh is God who has brought me in this B imagine Eve and Adam right there the thickest blaming oh let Theon I want to imagine it Hallelujah them blaming God think about it oh you can't blame godam says our Prophet says you can't tell your neighbor you can't you have got to blame yourself there is not a bit of need of anyone going to hell when God has made a provided way of Escape you can't help being a sinner you can't help that you you were bornn a sinner but you can help staying a [Applause] sinner the body pushing me this right but you don't suppos to stay like that you can help staying a sinner meaning you can change if you want to if you can accept Jesus as your in your place he was made sin for you God is way of Escape then you don't have to be a sinner you will be a Christian and you'll be holy not your own Holiness but his Holiness not what you are but what God has done for you Jesus your own ways you you you can quit lying you can quit stealing you can quit smoking that doesn't mean you are saved you cannot bypass a conviction Hallelujah the Bible does not say that is coming back for people who don't do bad things but he said he's coming back for those that are saved but you cannot be saved unless you receive a conviction of you can and when you receive the conviction of sin it will bring through repentance repentance will bring true salvation so you are saved because God ordained that you should be saved and he called your heart that's why you are saved no man can come to the father except bys him and he has made a way of Escape now how does he draw Us by a conviction praise God one day as a young person think about 19 or 17 years I was saved I thought but there things that I still did and um you know I uh I was watching this this kind of movies and um you know it is something that was a part of my life and I could not break out of it and I I had a pile of them as young person you know whatever you a young person would like watching is what I was fisting on and I had and I'm speaking this publicly because I'm giving a testimony maybe it will help someone and I had a pile of all these [Music] videos my pastor never knew no one knew I was preaching at the time but no one knew that I was still bound so a person can even preach and still go to hell if you don't receive a conviction you can be a minister and go to hell if you don't receive a conviction and I know we say that hell is not made for us and things like that that is a sermon for another day but this is what God has LA on my heart for and that day I remember I was in another country I had gone for missionary work in Zimbabwe I never forget that day and I'm saying this I have a witness right here I had left Brother Martin in my house to keep my house for me both of us were not married and so while in Zimbabwe I had all those piles of of CDs you know hidden away is in a stock somewhere under my bed no one no one knew that I had and so and and then while in Zimbabwe I uh we had service after service and one day the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is real the Holy Spirit came down and he started convincing me speaking to me no one was there I was all by myself and he started telling me this is wrong that is wrong this is wrong and I explained he said no that is wrong wrong because it brings this and does this and does this in your life explained everything and why certain things were in the way they were in my life at the time I tried to explain myself to him but friends he convinced me me and I broke down and I started repenting with bitter tears Lord please forgive me forgive me for what I've done forgive me for my life that has not been right and when I got off off my knees I called Brother Martin immediately I told him Brother Martin listen to me carefully I told him go under my bed there's a stock of some CS please find them I don't know what you want to do with them if you want to bur them or break destroy it all and I went off the [Music] phone that is a conviction and I never went back to those things never I was delivered never watch pornography again from that moment I never did again I got delivered let me tell you young people the holy spirit is real he can con you and speak to you on and convince you there is no reason of you being a Believer being in church when you are bound let experience the power of the Holy Spirit when you experience him you will never go back to those things again your lying will die your cheating will die your desires for pornography will die you will be born again the new birth is real and if you don't receive it you will not go in the Rapture and the time is running fast playing music is not enough preaching is not enough calling yourself a Believer is not enough even fasting for the whole day and praying for the old day is not enough to come to a place of conviction and you cannot come to that place unless you have amen presented yourself into the presence of the word of God evening services on Wednesday you start going late because we were watching a program one day we almost missed church because we had a program it is so cunning it happens so fast you don't feel it or plan for it even when you think spiritual and so I subscribed for that month and I traveled on a mission trip to Ethiopia was one of our first mission trips there and so while there I was with brother Paul and we were in this room and we started praying we prayed it was a good atmosphere pray and uh I I think um we prayed together until brother Paul slept off but something happened to me stop praying I continued praying tears were all over the floor and the the floor was cold but I couldn't feel the coldness any and I was just lying down beside the bed on the floor and uh at that moment the Holy Spirit started speaking to me convincing me that what I the decision I made to bring that ke in my home he gave me many reasons told me a lot of things revealed me a lot of things I can't explain it but I think and I believe that that is conviction and I I by the time I came out of that prayer I had repented and I made up my mind that when cuz now the next point was how am I going to talk to my wife because both of myself and and her were now glued to this and I didn't want to have problems in my marriage and so I uh I I just sprayed it away and I but I made up my mind I'm going to go back home and tell her what God dealt with me the experience I [Music] had and together if she agrees with me we would remove the dish and so when I arrived home I think it was about 2 weeks later I found that the C disconnected and I had left her with her young sister sister Anna and then I found that the cables were disconnected and there was only the screen and the dis was still up there and so I said why the was disconnected she said and when she told me the time it was at exactly the same time God was dealing with me God dealt with them while they were praying God convicted them to quit this thing and that she did not know how she would talk to me convince me to remove it away from let me tell you when the Holy Spirit comes we don't need to convince people to live things that's why me I learned the hard way that I am a pastor but I'm not the Holy Spirit some pastors follow up people what they doing what they have in their house no I don't do that because I've learned their hard if we preach the right message the Holy Spirit should convict you and convince you of sin and God came down I didn't have to convince my wife didn't have to convince me the Holy Spirit had done convince I called the man quickly he came he removed it and from that time we've never had in our home I can't imagine what my home would have been with that and these little children it is literally raising this generation all the bad stuff children are learning from TV you know the filthy things they learning from TV and they're bringing it in the society our government today is making laws against LGBT but they can't stop it it's a spirit and it's being transferred through this channels through these movies that the young people are watching through the televisions let me tell you there's only one thing that is going to stop people from sin is the conviction of the Holy Spirit and that's what you need that is what I need that's what we all need and allow me to read this qu as I close the message Jehovah Gyra he says now I don't condemn Sinners for the way they live that is all they know and I feel sorry for them I don't blame a sinner from going out and getting drunk that is all the pleasure he has give him another one I don't blame I don't blame him from gambling going to places Hony tongs and that's all the pleasure he got I don't blame a pig for eating out of man P that's all he [Music] knows my brother but you people who call yourselves Christians and you do it you are guy I am you know you are the one that I'm you wouldn't want to see you have another microphone you wouldn't want to see a lamb go to dinner with a pig would [Applause] [Music] you God God God he says be something strange but it wouldn't be strange for the pig eating there praise God I'm waiting for another microphone brother [Music] [Music] he finishes by saying you wouldn't want to see a lamb go to dinner with a pig it would be something strange but it wouldn't be strange if the pig is eating there so where is your nature that's where you will eat what's your diet if you're Abraham seat you believe God like Heavenly things separate yourself come out and be a pilgrim and a stranger praise God God bless [Music] you what I preach to you today was just from my heart church and I pray that we don't take it for granted that each of us will come to a place of conviction that we will truly [Music] repent until you receive the the gift of the Holy Ghost God wants to do that for you how many your heart and he will do that brother Peter there is a a a song that just came in my mind now there's some brothers in Malawi that sang it says Lord make me a doer of the word I don't know the words either but maybe you can just sing that chorus do you know do you know that song you know the [Music] song he says Lord Make Me A do of the not a church M but I do the oh it's my desire Lord make me a doer of the world Lord

mind father Lord I I come before you tonight I feel that the church needs a res Lord father Lord we need to reach that place where we shall have a reason a decision of what kind of life we want to live Paul says know that after turning many to [Music] righte that he himself doesn't make oh Lord on us for these are your children Lord that are called by Your Word my prayer tonight is that help us that we will be doers of your word we will live according to your word Lord we shall come to a place of conviction where we will not blame others Lord for things that have happened in our life but we will take responsibility and accept that we are the ones that are wrong and be convicted of sin and then repent of it father I want it to be whereby everyone will be filled with the spirit of God everyone will overcome and come to a place of total surrender Lord if this was to be the very last service we will ever have I pray that you give each of us a conviction conviction of sin in our that we shall love you with all our mind with all our mind with everything in us we shall please you Lord more than Lord Jesus we want to please ourselves we will not look at ourselves or think that ourselves to be [Music] anything father Lord we want don't want to see ourself as being anything we want to speak like you spoke when you came on Earth and you said without him I am nothing Lord we

us us speak to [Music] us Lord perhaps this service was for someone Lord I pray that you will work on their heart let this words continue ringing in their mind until they'll come to that place of conviction and if there be someone who is already in that place help them Lord to come to a place of full repentance because that's what the Holy Spirit does says when he the spirit of Truth is coming
