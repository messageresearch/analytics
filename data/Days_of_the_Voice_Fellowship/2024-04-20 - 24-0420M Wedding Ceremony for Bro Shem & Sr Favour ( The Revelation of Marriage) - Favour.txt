[Music] moment dearly beloved we are gathered here in the sight of God and in the presence of these witnesses to join together and in the bonds of holy matrimony according to the ordinance of God the custom of the Christian Church law of this nation and to on their behalf the blessing of God psms 1271 it is written except the Lord build the houseb in vain that marriage is Honorable it's a ho insti which was started by God in the garden ofen it was there that the Lord God said it is good that the man should be alone it is good it is not good that the man should be alone it was there that Eve was then fashioned out of the rib of Adam and given to him for a wife and it was thus recorded therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh it is also sanctioned and honored by Jesus's Christ Presence at the marriage in car in galile and this exists between between Christ and his church God ordains it as the foundation and bond of family life for the mut help for comfort of husband and wife and for the welfare of the State marriage there is not to be entered upon by any inadvisably lightly but should be entered into reverent and in the fear of God and into this holy estate these two persons now desire to enter by being joined together as one therefore If any man can show any just cause why these two may not LLY be joined together let him now declare it just had to be quiet for a moment and no one came up and so if there is any forever hold your [Music] peace need to say amen for that moreover I charge you both before God the searer of All Hearts if either of you know of any impediment why you may not LLY be United together as husband and do conf for be rest assured that you will surely answer the day of judgment when the secrets of all heart shall be disclosed if there is either of you that know of any impendent why you should not be LLY joined together in this holy be also assured that so many of us are joined together otherwise than God's word allow because there many who are living together but they were never joined together as God's word alls just know those are not United by the Lord neither is their marriage blessed by him and so that was just a little bit of an introduction which we usually start with just to take it out of the way and now from here I would like everybody to smile this is

not able to do things on time many things that have happened which looked like it will fail everything done last minute shame and fav let me assure you whatever God has started nothing can stop nothing can stop it praise God and so we are not going to delay here in the church after the sharing of the word we are going to do the vows the signing and then we will right away go to the ven so I

wonderful time you took good care of us when we came uh from the first time when we went to uh Cala to visit actually to visit before Thea and then we went for Thea which is the now the previsit and then after that we did the yesterday so it's been quite a journey but God has been in that Journey every step of the way and to those of you who are worried about what we are going to share I want you to be stress free here we just Bible Believers and we're going to instruct the young man and the young man and the young lady from the scriptures straight away to The Vow praise God let's first PR our loving father author of life we are so glad today because you are here and you have smiled Upon Us upon shame upon favor and you have allowed them to come to this day and Lord now for the remainder of the part of the service this wedding ceremony may it be blessed of you may you Grant each one joy in their hearts May their Joy be full Lord by the end of this ceremony today may we rejoice in our heart together with in Jesus name amen amen amen if you have a Bible you can turn with me if you do not just listen and I already started it out I'll just use my iPad IP so Ephesians chapter 5 31-32 says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church that is uh Ephesians 5:31 [Music] [Music] now I know usually on the wedding we are pre I'm preaching to you shame and I'm preaching to you favor I also know many times you don't hear everything because of what is going around in your mind the stress of the event so I'm privy to the fact that they are recording the service and streaming it live as well don't worry if I take a few moment like 30 minutes because I know you'll go back and and listen to that afterwards so now I'm going to speak to you on the revelation of marriage and I'm going to divide my thought into three three points and I'm going to ask the first question in forms in form of questions what is revelation What is marriage and to whom will God reveal so let's go quickly to the first question what is revelation because the Bible says that two becoming one is a mystery so if it is a mystery those who do it it means they have attained revelation of what the mystery is and so what is revelation now the Church of Jesus Christ is built upon revelation of who Jesus is and to be able to uh to to demonstrate this for you I'm going to read the scripture in the Book of Matthew 16 vers 13 to 19 um it says when Jesus came into the course of ceria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah oh one of the prophets he said unto them whom say ye that I am all right now this is Jesus Christ on Earth and is you know with the disciples and and he's asking them what the people say that he is and of course they said some call you John you El some call you Jeremiah but then he brought it down to them what about you what do you say that I the son of and then you know the all looked at each other but on verse 16 one of them Simon Peter answered and he said thou the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed thou Simon flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gat of Hell shall not Prevail against I give unto the the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatever thou shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shall lose on shall be Lo in heaven so now the Church of Jesus Christ is built listen Upon This Rock and the question is what is the rock now some the Roman Catholics say that the rock is Peter and you know Peter was buried in in in Rome and they built a big church and called it St Peter Basilica and they said now you know the church this is the church the first church CH that's why Catholic means Universal they mean that their church is the only one true Universal Church of Christ upon and the Protestants say that no it's not Peter it is Jesus upon whom the church is built but the question is what is this rock the rock that Jesus was speaking of was neither Peter nor Jesus but he said this flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock upon which rock upon the upon the revelation of Jesus of Who Let me put it this way upon the revelation of who Jesus is that Peter had received that was The Rock and the Church of Jesus Christ is built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ and that church is a mystical body that church is is a mysterious body let me call it that way you can't see it with eyes it is a universal church all over the world it is not Anglican it's not Catholic not Pentecostal but what is that church it is the body of Jesus Christ those who have a revelation who Jesus Christ is and who is Jesus Christ amen is he that was in heaven God he came and put on flesh and he dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the only glory of the begotten of the father so who was Jesus Christ the savior of the body who is Jesus Christ he's the head and the church is the body who is Jesus Christ he's the husband and the church is the wife who is Jesus Christ is the male and we are his wife Revelation 197 says be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made her so the Church of Jesus Christ is in Kenya is in Ethiopia is in zimb my friend from Zim where is he is he right in here outside okay he's from Zimbabwe is all over the world the Church of Jesus Christ is not limited to a place or to a denomination or to a place like this but it is a mystical body Jesus Christ is the husband of he came down from Glory who was he he was God himself God is a spirit and as a spirit he could not die for us so he had to put on flesh so he can come down and bleed and die God put on flesh and he came down but I have a question why did he come down he came to redeem his so who are we if you believe in Jesus Christ you are his wife you are the Church of Jesus Christ but to believe that you have to have the Revelation it's it's a type what we are having here is a type of that is a physical manifestation of the spiritual thing that is already going on today is redeeming his bride he found his bride in M's home and he went to redeem her Jesus Christ came down on Earth and he found us here on Earth and he came to redeem us to him amen it is a revelation and the Church of Jesus Christ is not built upon Creeds it's not built upon Dogma built upon Christ the revelation Christ is Jesus Christ is his own word and all the Believers all over the world when they hear that they believe it and the first thing they do they take his name when you hear about it Jesus Christ my husband then you say I accept him as my personal what comes next his name how in water Christian baptism it must be in the only one name which we have given on Earth whereby we can be saved the Bible says there is no other name given to us to be saved The Only Name which can redeem us The Only Name which can save us that name is Jesus Christ that's why when we are baptizing we baptize people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a powerful name it's a mighty name Hallelujah from today she's taking another name because she's redeemed she's taken out of a family and joining another family it beautiful is a revelation so this Revelation is given by God Alone no man figures it out and it alone is that Revelation that a GS of Hell cannot Prevail the revelation of marriage oh my God I'll finish with that God's Prophet said it it show the gates of hell would be against it could not Prevail Hallelujah the Gates of Hell will fight against the Church of Jesus Christ but they could not Prevail they cannot overcome Church how many of you believe in Jesus Christ let me [Music] tell there is no hell that will overcome because you got a revation that you have a savior hallelujah amen that's why I'm excited about that hallelujah hallelujah if it doesn't excite you then I don't know what can excite just like right now is excited as we were coming she began crying because she was excited she was going to be Redeemed by someone who has a name name of she was going to be redeemed and taken to and she knows as long as shame is there no one can Prevail against we could suddenly say that the gates of hell are against marriage in this day all hell fight marriage the devil doesn't want young people to get married he want them to get to to get lost but I want to tell you man woman here there are some men reation of marriage all the of cannot Prevail that Revelation it comes by Revelation it comes by re even if someone hits your head and he says go Mar go Mar you cannot if you try because they forced you it will fail it has to be a [Applause] revelation praise God is against it he's not against the word marriage but is against the reality what God intended marriage to be everybody wants to claim the word marriage but God is intended use of this sacred Union is what the devil would destroy what is God's intention of marriage is that the two shall become one will be husband and wife part of a union there only three in there where it is the man the woman and God and the rest on the outside but the devil has tried to make that fail he has tried to bring John and Steve together he has tried to bring Susan and Esther he has tried to destroy the very Union what it meant the devil has Tri take young men and join them into prostitution younger ladies sleeping with with men who are who are never their husbands and will never be their husbands fornicating in out and and they calling themselves this generation has died where Chris do you know that salvation does not allow to do such things but our age is dying the ERS here allow me say it we must fight for our children fight for our youth we should not allow this kind of action of fornication sex before marriage why because they will spoil the Next Generation there won't be people to serve God when you see young men getting married these days we don't want to support them because we you are still young you study go and get master and get PhD can't get this and that but as they are getting spoiled what is the best are they Our God word how many will say today stand with the word and say Amen that is what we believe and I want to thank the father and the mother and all the other par to support favor these are still young children young ones why are theying the Bible says if you are burning it didn't say when you bur I have a demon of burning no I have say they pull me says if you are burning if they don't have money parents stand with we build a nation build the Next Generation say Amen where is it it is revelation Revelation let me stop there because if I continue on that case I may make some people angry the ones who don't support the the supported praise God hallelujah amen sh got Revelation and he said I want to get married and I said are you sure do have you found somebody said yes are you sure about her he said I was just there and something just struck me and began telling me everything about favor one by one by one by one and it was like her life was open before my heart I can't explain I did not ever know that I would love fa because they were going to the same school in the same class both of them are into Aviation but sh got a revelation is that correct yes sir Revelation even saying yes sir because he knows and Fa two came to me she said pastor I know he is my husband I know it I know it what was that Revelation let marriage be by revelation not Arrangement no no no not not what what is the word I'm looking for help me find it brother K yes not much making deserve that the way I see her she's my wife it comes from R but for us Believers we know it is revelation and Revelation comes from God not from the world all right let's quickly now run to the next part uh the next we have two two more What is marriage now marriage I just want to say I usually do this on every wedding but let me just rehearse a little bit here marriage shame and favor more than a vow it is deeper than just leing together is deeper than cohabitation is richer than a physical relationship alone it is unique on Earth it is unlike any other relation any other relationship you have ever been a it is more important than any of those except one relationship my god there are many relationships on Earth but there is one which is more important than any other and that is your relationship with Christ he found you with Jesus Christ if your relationship wants to separate you with that then then that's where now now if she wants to separate you from that relationship you can think twice but apart from that relationship with Jesus Christ the second best most important relationship is this one here you have your father your mother who love you so much your sisters who are here love you so much your cousins your uncles your same thing with you even me I'm taken up with that let me tell you if I ever tell you anything and it is bring problems with your leave it take what this is the most important relationship it is important more than any other more important than any other though all these relationships your relationships with your pastors with your wife I mean with your with your sister Brothers all those ones will fail even this one will fa may fail fa but this one is the most crucial one that you'll ever be a part of is my mother here oh she is she not yet she's still outside okay so I know they streaming and they feel bad Whenever I Call on them now my mother I'm tell you this when I bought a car my mother knew woman so when I bought M I'm sorry I have to say it when I I put my mother in the back SE and I put my wife in the and my mother was not Happ she said you know you have you were in my for months you see the breasts fed you how can you do that to me I felt so bad I love my mother but I told her mama what you said is correct but I also have one correct my wife is not more important than me but she's me so that's why she has to be here I'm glad now she has her own car so I don't have but shame if you buy a car which I know you are going to do that front seat not for any other woman it is for your wife I'm preaching to my children it is for your wife praise God this is more than just a vow many people make a vow but that in itself is not staying power that is only obligation Real Marriage goes well beyond the V there is a great power in for a man to be fully completed and fulfilled sh you have been a half man all this time but from today not been completed you're going to be fulfilled you're going to be more happy going to have more weights wait and see praise God hallelujah and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I'll make him help me am I out of 30 minutes if I am and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fall of the air brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle of the air every pie of but for there was not found birs in all the creeping things in all the beautiful things in the world you hear me brother sh all the good things of the world shame never found help helmet fit for him now all the things all the things you've seen now what you're doing today you're saying the other one the other things were not the help met you found it to be your wife there's no help me to be found in nature but your wife so empowered with this true Revelation what marriage is the man can fulfill his life's purpose he has a purpose in his life but you were a part of it you remember that day you receive that Revelation and you said I want to be there's a woman said I want to be like this woman I want to be this in sh's life God has answered that and go leave that purpose without that Revelation the union will always need something and that in itself will be a hinderance all the days of his life if you fa to find purpose now the Bible refers to to her as a help me these ones are very lovely words listen to them she can comfort you like no other and I know the very first time you will take her to your BOS she lives a spiritual and that no other can feel that talks about the wife of your you her trust she trusts with all her life and her trust is to be treasur respect her weakness her giving to you you know her giving is to be h you know when she you know makes food and if you don't like it don't kick it with your don't shout at her her we believe in treasuring our wives you've been with me for all these years you've seen how our submission is to be cherished her obedience is to be adored there is great power in marriage for a wife to minister to her you are a minister now you are being crowned a minister from today official minister minister in you know the government of shment Hallelujah proverbs 31 says who can find a VIR the heart of her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do you don't need to put him in a in a in a bottle the Christian bottle do you know the Christian bottle I know your mother knows it she told you Mama's come I greet you Mama the bottle for Christians is the needs she will do him good all the days of her life when things are failing you go and put him in the bottle if you have not it pray for him sometimes when I go wild at home I feel as if I'm a sheep see what is going on and then I my wife said I was praying for you fasting for you let me tell you that is the power the strength of every woman in marriage to pray for your husband every day even if they think they very wild that one will make them simple her children are raised uped her husband also and he Praises her should her if she's this virtuous woman come here with some nice you know swee in Ethiopia we have in ethopia we have better words you know you know like thata her many daughters have done virtuous but she them favor favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord shall be praised if a man has found a true wife God has given him the second best gift that a man could receive first being she's to be treed as such she to be treasured above all natural things above all other accomplishments only should be valed in your life higher than [Music] her salvation is find a good thing a wife a good thing can we say Amen to that and obtain and obtain has put favor in your life God has put favor here and favor also that means you must Prosper everything you do you must Prosper know the parents are with me while we are declaring this you must you drive the car you will get the big amen you will you will serve God hallelujah you will serve God you will asham the devil you will be an example what is that favor Hallelujah hallelu and lastly to whom will God reveal these things at that time Jesus answered and said in 112 I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them to babies because this is a revelation you cannot learn it from a book you you even not from your parents even not from your pastor everybody has their experience and their advice but just like everything else much adice is not bested on Revelation there are many marriages on shifting signs of man wisdom don't go there someone give you a book how to be married for 50 years without a problem go and read it your that will not what works is revelation let me tell you sometimes you can be in marriage and you in hard situations problems will come they always do hinderances come but in the mid of all these things always let your ears be open what does God say we believe in Consulting God about everything we do because God answers prayer how many can say Amen to that God answers prayer so you see let your marriage be best on Revelation favor you need to go to God to find the two meanings of those wordsy submission thing with your cherish of yourself those words what do they mean God will reveal it to you and as you make your voice now in a moment don't blindly say the words but rather silently pray that God will make those words real to you whether you search out the answer of what it really means as that for this cause a man shall leave his father and shall Beed his wife and they shall be one the B say this is a great mystery and today it is still a mystery even to married couples but it won't be a mystery it won't if you seek God with all your heart the almighty God creator of the universe the of Life the give of every good gift grant that marriage would be not a mystery to you to you both God bless you [Applause] now we shall go to the next phase of this the vows I'm waiting on the musicians this is the moment we've waited for if you have them to stand Maybe [Music] [Music] me
