[1:18:45] Daniel. Uh history says that this
[1:18:48] happened around 350 years before Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ was
[1:18:55] born as as we read in the first first
[1:18:59] verse that it began with uh the siege of
[1:19:03] Jerusalem.
[1:19:07] King
[1:19:09] Nebuchadnezzar attacked
[1:19:12] Jerusalem. When he attacked Jerusalem,
[1:19:15] he besieged it.
[1:19:18] Amen. So when he besieged
[1:19:20] it, the Lord had given Jerusalem unto
[1:19:24] the hands of King
[1:19:27] Nebuchadnezzar because of the
[1:19:29] disobedience of the children of Israel.
[1:19:33] Amen. Amen. So he gave he he gave them
[1:19:36] to the hands of their
[1:19:38] enemies. But when they were given to the
[1:19:40] hands of their
[1:19:42] enemies, the Bible
[1:19:44] says that when the king had beseeched
[1:19:49] Jerusalem that he took all the
[1:19:53] treasures which were in the temple, he
[1:19:56] took them in the house of his gods.
[1:19:59] And the other thing he did he the Bible
[1:20:02] says that he he told he told one of his
[1:20:07] his master of the
[1:20:11] unax he told him that you should bring a
[1:20:14] certain of the children of
[1:20:18] Israel of the king's
[1:20:21] seed and of the
[1:20:24] princes children in whom was no blemish.
[1:20:29] Notice he had taken the treasures in the
[1:20:32] in the
[1:20:34] temple. But he didn't stop
[1:20:36] there. He also told his
[1:20:40] uno that make sure you bring
[1:20:44] children which are children who come
[1:20:47] from the king's
[1:20:49] lineage. He said that these children
[1:20:52] have to have no
[1:20:54] blemish. They have to be well favored.
[1:20:58] They have to be
[1:21:00] skillful in all wisdom and cunning in
[1:21:04] knowledge and understanding
[1:21:07] science and such as had ability in them
[1:21:11] to stand in the king's palace.
[1:21:17] This is the this is the qualification he
[1:21:21] wanted that the children he has to
[1:21:24] choose they have to to meet these
[1:21:28] qualifications. Why? Because they are
[1:21:30] going to serve
[1:21:31] him.
[1:21:34] Hallelujah. He continues on. He
[1:21:37] says that when when they when this man
[1:21:39] chose these children out of out of
[1:21:42] because remember the kingdom was was was
[1:21:44] attacked and it was besieged. So he he
[1:21:47] chose children out of these out of these
[1:21:50] of these children who are young in this
[1:21:52] in this
[1:22:00] kingdom. Amen. And he said he told the
[1:22:03] king told this
[1:22:05] man
[1:22:06] that he appointed them a daily provision
[1:22:10] of the king's
[1:22:14] meat. Amen.
[1:22:18] He told him, "A
[1:22:20] daily a daily
[1:22:23] provision of the king's
[1:22:26] meat." Hallelujah.
[1:22:30] Because they were going to stand before
[1:22:31] the
[1:22:33] king. Amen.
[1:22:36] Amen. The meat is to make them ready to
[1:22:40] serve the
[1:22:42] king. Because this you cannot serve the
[1:22:45] king when you are
[1:22:47] weak, when you are looking
[1:22:50] hungry. So he told him you you have to
[1:22:52] give them the food that I
[1:22:54] eat because they are going to stand
[1:22:57] before
[1:22:59] me and serve before
[1:23:01] me. Amen. The Bible says that in these
[1:23:04] they were children uh of Judah named
[1:23:07] Daniel, Haniah, Mishael and Ael. And he
[1:23:11] said in verse seven, he said that in
[1:23:14] these four in these four children,
[1:23:16] because the Bible says they were
[1:23:17] children, he says that he gave them new
[1:23:20] names.
[1:23:32] And he gave them other
[1:23:34] names.
[1:23:36] Hallelujah. They were given the
[1:23:38] Babylonian names.
[1:23:41] Hallelujah.
[1:23:43] But there was something about uh uh
[1:23:45] these four children. These four
[1:23:48] children. If you read from verse 8 to go
[1:23:52] down, I won't read all through. But if
[1:23:55] you read this whole
[1:23:56] chapter in verse 8, it shows that Daniel
[1:24:00] was purposed in his
[1:24:03] heart that he's not going to defile
[1:24:07] himself with the
[1:24:10] meat which was offered unto
[1:24:13] him. Amen. Amen. The Bible continues to
[1:24:17] say that God gave them favor because of
[1:24:19] that decision they had made.
[1:24:24] because they had chose the way of
[1:24:28] God. Hallelujah. Because the Bible tells
[1:24:31] us that uh uh that the other children
[1:24:34] for them they accepted to eat the
[1:24:38] meat. But for Daniel and these four
[1:24:41] these three other other children they
[1:24:43] they said no we shall not eat this meat.
[1:24:49] And the Bible says that the Enoch tried
[1:24:50] to to encourage them to
[1:24:56] eat. He encouraged them to eat this
[1:25:00] meat because the king had commanded
[1:25:04] commanded him to give them the
[1:25:07] meat. But the Bible says that Daniel
[1:25:09] said, "No, we shall not eat this meat."
[1:25:13] He told he told him you just give us
[1:25:16] uh he told he told he told the king you
[1:25:19] just he told him you just give us you
[1:25:22] don't give us this meat you just give us
[1:25:25] this you know vegetables and uh without
[1:25:28] the meat of the king and the and the
[1:25:30] wine of the king he said don't give us
[1:25:32] that you just give us this normal normal
[1:25:34] normal
[1:25:38] food and he told he told this man that
[1:25:41] You give us 10 days. You You try us in
[1:25:43] 10
[1:25:45] days. And after these 10 days, you shall
[1:25:48] compare us with the other ones who
[1:25:52] ate the king's meat and us who did not
[1:25:55] eat it. The Bible says that they they
[1:25:58] were given what they had
[1:26:02] asked. And after 10
[1:26:04] days, the Bible tells
[1:26:07] us that the the four children
[1:26:11] eat the the
[1:26:13] meat.
[1:26:16] Hallelujah. And the Bible continues to
[1:26:18] say that after that God blessed
[1:26:22] them. He the Bible says he gave them
[1:26:25] knowledge and
[1:26:28] skill in learning and
[1:26:31] wisdom. The Bible says that and Daniel
[1:26:33] had understanding in all visions and
[1:26:36] dreams.
[1:26:42] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So the the Bible
[1:26:45] continues to say that after that that
[1:26:47] the king called them these these these
[1:26:49] four
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:53] boys and when he called
[1:26:56] them he loved them because they had
[1:26:59] found
[1:27:00] favor in the eyes of the
[1:27:03] king. Amen. So like you know like what
[1:27:07] happened to these boys when they were in
[1:27:10] Israel? It happens to us in our
[1:27:14] lives. Amen. We the human
[1:27:17] race. We are caught we are caught
[1:27:23] up. We were caught up between the
[1:27:25] disobedience of of our fathers.
[1:27:32] Adam. When Adam disobeyed
[1:27:35] God, God judged
[1:27:38] Adam and the the judgment fell on his
[1:27:41] seed after
[1:27:44] him. Like you see these boys because
[1:27:47] they were
[1:27:48] young. When the king attacked
[1:27:51] them, they were young. They didn't know
[1:27:53] anything.
[1:27:55] They didn't they didn't put any input in
[1:27:58] in what made the king to come and attack
[1:28:03] them. But it just happened they found
[1:28:06] themselves in that kind of
[1:28:09] situation. Amen. The Bible says in
[1:28:11] Romans
[1:28:12] 5 12, it says that therefore as by one
[1:28:16] man sin entered into the
[1:28:20] world and death by
[1:28:23] sin and so forth passed upon all
[1:28:28] men for that all have
[1:28:32] sinned. Hallelujah. Some of us are sick
[1:28:36] without our input.
[1:28:40] We are simply caught up in the
[1:28:42] disobedience of those who came before
[1:28:47] us.
[1:28:48] Hallelujah. Amen. You you you have a
[1:28:51] sickness which is tormenting
[1:28:54] you but you just you just got it from
[1:28:57] your
[1:28:58] forefathers. You are not there when they
[1:29:01] did what made them get that that
[1:29:04] sickness. But you are now suffering.
[1:29:08] because you came from
[1:29:11] them. Hallelujah. That teaches us what?
[1:29:15] That the decisions we
[1:29:18] make, they don't stop on
[1:29:21] us. Amen. Amen. They they go on unto our
[1:29:25] descendants after
[1:29:28] us. For example, a mother or a
[1:29:33] father who teaches not to who decides
[1:29:36] not to teach his children the will of
[1:29:37] the
[1:29:39] Lord.
[1:29:42] Amen. The children are the one who get
[1:29:44] in the
[1:29:46] suffering because for them they have
[1:29:48] aged they have little
[1:29:52] time. The punishment goes on the
[1:29:55] children. Some of us the the the the the
[1:29:59] sins which easily beset
[1:30:03] us they they caught us when we are when
[1:30:06] we are
[1:30:09] young. Amen. When we are young because
[1:30:12] maybe we didn't have godly
[1:30:14] parents who could teach us who could
[1:30:16] teach us that this is wrong. This is
[1:30:18] this is like this according to the
[1:30:21] word and we are caught up in that kind
[1:30:23] of
[1:30:24] environment. Amen. I believe in
[1:30:26] continuity of a
[1:30:30] blessing. Even when when you make the
[1:30:33] right
[1:30:34] decision, the blessing of
[1:30:37] God does not stop only on you, it goes
[1:30:41] on unto your
[1:30:44] descendants. When God when God blessed
[1:30:48] Abraham, he also blessed his seed after
[1:30:51] him.
[1:30:52] When God blessed
[1:30:54] David, he also blessed
[1:30:57] Solomon, after when Solomon disobeyed
[1:31:01] God, the Bible says that God said, "I'm
[1:31:03] not going to take away this
[1:31:05] kingdom from Solomon because of his
[1:31:09] father." Hallelujah. So, we can we can
[1:31:12] get blessings because of the decisions
[1:31:14] of our
[1:31:15] father. For example, this place we are
[1:31:19] enjoying, we are not the ones who built
[1:31:21] it.
[1:31:22] Amen. Amen. There is a man who came and
[1:31:25] toiled and labored but now we are
[1:31:29] enjoying
[1:31:30] it. Amen. We as a Christians should
[1:31:34] learn the decisions we we
[1:31:37] make either right or wrong the things
[1:31:41] which overcome us they will overcome our
[1:31:44] children. The things we overcome it will
[1:31:48] be so easy for our children to
[1:31:49] overcome. Hallelujah.
[1:31:52] So the Bible
[1:31:55] says that the king when the king chose
[1:31:57] chose these these children,
[1:32:01] he chose those who are
[1:32:04] blameless. Amen. Amen. The king was
[1:32:07] typing uh uh the
[1:32:14] devil. Brother Brham says that the devil
[1:32:17] wants to use beautiful things.
[1:32:24] the the the the king, he chose he told
[1:32:27] him, "You
[1:32:29] go and look for those children who are
[1:32:33] blameless, who are wise." Amen. Amen.
[1:32:38] And you bring
[1:32:39] them. Amen. Amen. The devil wants to use
[1:32:42] beautiful things.
[1:32:45] He wants to build his
[1:32:48] kingdom but using God's
[1:32:52] instruments. Remember God is the one who
[1:32:55] you remember the sacrifice in the Old
[1:32:57] Testament. It was a sacrifice which was
[1:33:00] a lamb without
[1:33:05] blemish. The devil is a copy. He tries
[1:33:07] to
[1:33:09] copy what God is trying to
[1:33:13] make and he tries to use it in his own
[1:33:16] perverted
[1:33:17] way. Let me read a quote here where
[1:33:20] brother Brham talks about
[1:33:24] that. Let me read that quote here. It's
[1:33:27] in the
[1:33:28] message the message three kinds of
[1:33:31] believers. He says Satan is the one that
[1:33:34] dwells in beauty.
[1:33:37] That's exactly what the scripture
[1:33:39] says. That's the reason sometimes a
[1:33:42] pretty
[1:33:44] woman is a bait for
[1:33:47] Satan. If he can just get a hold of
[1:33:51] her, he can twist more men into hell
[1:33:54] than he
[1:33:59] could than he could with all the Bums in
[1:34:03] this country.
[1:34:06] That's right.
[1:34:07] See, oh handsome, oh great handsome man,
[1:34:13] that without stand up in his trueeness
[1:34:16] of
[1:34:19] manhood. Amen. He can swing them women
[1:34:22] to the
[1:34:25] devil and to send them to
[1:34:27] hell. Yes, sir. He says, notice Satan
[1:34:31] dwells in
[1:34:33] beauty. What did he try to do in the
[1:34:36] beginning? Make a more beautiful
[1:34:39] kingdom than Michael was.
[1:34:43] Hallelujah. So you see you see the
[1:34:46] tactics of the
[1:34:48] devil. Amen. The people who who
[1:34:51] who if the like brother Brham has said
[1:34:55] here,
[1:34:57] if you go to see these people who who
[1:35:01] sell themselves on the on the roads,
[1:35:06] these prostitutes. They are not ugly
[1:35:11] women. They are not ugly. The devil
[1:35:14] chooses the
[1:35:16] beautiful and he wants to use them to
[1:35:19] build his
[1:35:21] kingdom. Hallelujah. But this kingdom
[1:35:23] was given to them by
[1:35:26] God. Because these children of Israel,
[1:35:30] this Daniel, the wisdom they had, it was
[1:35:33] given by
[1:35:35] God. They were simply taken from the
[1:35:37] other
[1:35:39] kingdom using
[1:35:41] Godgiven privileges that they
[1:35:45] had. Now this king desired to use those
[1:35:48] same same
[1:35:50] things. Amen.
[1:35:52] The devil does not have uh what he what
[1:35:56] he needs to build his
[1:35:59] kingdom. He uses the people of
[1:36:04] God, uses their
[1:36:07] beauty. Amen. And deceives them to build
[1:36:11] his own
[1:36:13] kingdom. Notice the king tked one of his
[1:36:19] uns. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:22] to he told him that you have to make
[1:36:25] sure that you give these these the these
[1:36:30] children
[1:36:33] daily
[1:36:35] meat and and and wine from from my where
[1:36:39] I eat
[1:36:42] from. Hallelujah.
[1:36:47] The
[1:36:48] devil is on our case
[1:36:52] daily. Hallelujah. The devil does not
[1:36:56] give you
[1:36:59] rest. The king tked this man that make
[1:37:02] sure
[1:37:04] daily. Hallelujah. That's why you cannot
[1:37:07] be a Christian on
[1:37:10] Sunday Christian on
[1:37:12] Wednesday and other days you are not a
[1:37:14] Christian.
[1:37:16] Hallelujah. Because the devil uses I'm
[1:37:20] going to Okay, I'm going to Let's open
[1:37:22] in First Corinthians 15:31.
[1:37:27] 1 Corinthians
[1:37:41] 15:31. 15 31. It
[1:37:46] says, it
[1:37:49] says, says, I protest by your rejoicing
[1:37:53] which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I
[1:37:57] die
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:09] daily. Hallelujah. Amen. Paul is telling
[1:38:12] us that he dies
[1:38:14] daily. Amen. The battle is is a daily
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:19] battle. Hallelujah. Because the devil
[1:38:22] has assigned his
[1:38:24] demons to make sure every
[1:38:27] day. Every day. Make sure you bring them
[1:38:33] meat. Every day. Daily. Amen. There's no
[1:38:37] time to
[1:38:38] rest. Hallelujah. That's why also Paul
[1:38:41] has told us we have to die
[1:38:45] daily in one quote he
[1:38:47] says that in the morning you can wake up
[1:38:50] when you're
[1:38:52] Christian and at night you go to
[1:38:56] bed when you a
[1:38:58] sinner amen because you've not fought
[1:39:02] daily you've known the you've not fought
[1:39:04] the
[1:39:05] battle amen since the devil's attacks
[1:39:08] are daily
[1:39:12] What God does, he also gives us a daily
[1:39:17] bread. Hallelujah. In his prayer, he
[1:39:20] told us that we should
[1:39:23] pray to God to give us a daily
[1:39:27] break. Why? Because we are attacked
[1:39:30] daily. So, we have to be empowered
[1:39:33] daily. Hallelujah. We are not Christians
[1:39:36] on certain days.
[1:39:38] We have to be Christian
[1:39:41] daily. Hallelujah. There's another
[1:39:44] brother emphasizes on that thing. Let me
[1:39:47] read it here very
[1:39:49] fast. He
[1:39:55] says it
[1:40:02] is. He says, "And now sin caused all
[1:40:05] this to happen.
[1:40:09] And God through this age is gathering up
[1:40:11] his
[1:40:15] material. Satan is still
[1:40:17] here. Present
[1:40:20] tense
[1:40:22] is still here. Amen. Amen. That's the
[1:40:26] reason all these things
[1:40:29] happen. He is still here. And all of his
[1:40:33] evil
[1:40:34] forces are still here.
[1:40:37] Notice that's why the earth is full of
[1:40:41] filth. That's why the scam and
[1:40:43] ridiculous things that goes
[1:40:47] on, bloodshed,
[1:40:49] war, politics,
[1:40:52] sin,
[1:40:54] adultery, all kinds of filthiness goes
[1:40:57] on is because that Satan is the ruler of
[1:41:01] this
[1:41:04] atmosphere. Hallelujah. Amen. Satan is
[1:41:07] here.
[1:41:08] Amen. That's why we see these these
[1:41:10] things
[1:41:11] daily. We see
[1:41:13] murderers. Amen. We see we see
[1:41:17] politics, sin,
[1:41:20] adultery. Amen. Let me tell you. Don't
[1:41:23] be caught up in those
[1:41:24] things. Amen. Those demons are assigned
[1:41:27] by
[1:41:29] Satan. They attack us.
[1:41:32] So you should learn that these are the
[1:41:34] attacks of the
[1:41:36] enemy. Amen. What I'm trying to do, I'm
[1:41:39] trying to show us the the
[1:41:42] tactics that the devil uses and to
[1:41:45] attack us. Amen. He says that the daily
[1:41:49] meant was meant to make them ready to
[1:41:53] serve the king.
[1:42:00] Notice in this age we have we have uh so
[1:42:04] many things of
[1:42:08] entertainment and often times some of us
[1:42:10] are caught up in those
[1:42:14] things for example these apps Tik Tok
[1:42:17] and
[1:42:19] words when you go and watch that
[1:42:21] thing the entertainment of the
[1:42:25] world often times when sometimes when
[1:42:27] you go even to sleep
[1:42:30] You start dreaming what you saw.
[1:42:33] Hallelujah. Amen. And imagine people who
[1:42:36] feed on that
[1:42:39] day. It is a preparation by the
[1:42:43] enemy. Amen. Amen. Such that he's going
[1:42:46] to use him to serve
[1:42:48] him. Hallelujah. They don't begin when
[1:42:51] they are worse
[1:42:53] off. They begin slowly.
[1:42:57] daily, daily, daily, daily. Hallelujah.
[1:43:00] Just just like you see
[1:43:02] sickness when you go to the
[1:43:05] hospital when you when you've just uh uh
[1:43:09] received the
[1:43:12] sickness and uh they tell you it's good
[1:43:15] you've come
[1:43:17] early. Amen. But when you go
[1:43:20] late for example the imag you know
[1:43:24] cancer you know that there are people
[1:43:26] who go to the
[1:43:27] hospital and they tell them that this
[1:43:29] cancer is in the latest
[1:43:34] stages the devil has
[1:43:37] already
[1:43:39] he for all of you he has eaten
[1:43:43] you it's a tactic he eats you
[1:43:47] lady, the the longer you you you take
[1:43:50] without going to the
[1:43:53] hospital, when you go there, you already
[1:43:56] finished.
[1:43:58] Why? Because he know he
[1:44:01] knows. He goes to you
[1:44:04] daily. Notice the Enoch gave them
[1:44:08] names. Hallelujah. They took away their
[1:44:11] names. They took away their god-given
[1:44:13] names. They gave them other names.
[1:44:17] the names of Babylon.
[1:44:19] Hallelujah.
[1:44:21] The same thing that the devil
[1:44:23] calls, the devil does to many of
[1:44:29] us in this world because we are caught
[1:44:32] up in maybe families which are
[1:44:35] adulterous
[1:44:38] families,
[1:44:40] drunkards. He calls you those
[1:44:42] names. He calls you poor.
[1:44:46] Because you have that name. Your your
[1:44:47] father is poor. When you
[1:44:49] see you are poor, your lineage is poor.
[1:44:53] So he gives you a
[1:44:54] name. Amen. A name. He calls you a
[1:44:59] failure. He calls you poor. He calls you
[1:45:03] confused. He called you a
[1:45:05] beggar. He called you
[1:45:07] blind,
[1:45:09] deaf, dump. You a holy roller.
[1:45:14] Hallelujah. The same tactic like we see
[1:45:17] here. Hallelujah. They remove their
[1:45:20] names. They gave them their other
[1:45:23] names. But the Bible is so
[1:45:26] interesting. The Bible does not say the
[1:45:28] book
[1:45:30] of what they called
[1:45:32] Daniel in in Babylon. Amen. God does not
[1:45:37] call you by this
[1:45:38] name. God does not call you a failure.
[1:45:42] He does not call you
[1:45:43] poor, confused or a
[1:45:46] beggar. Amen. He calls you his
[1:45:49] name. You are still a child no matter
[1:45:53] the condition you are
[1:45:55] in. Amen. Amen. And there's something
[1:45:57] which these boys
[1:45:59] did. Amen. Which is so
[1:46:02] interesting. Amen. Amen. God does not
[1:46:05] call us but by what the world calls
[1:46:08] us. Amen. Amen. In the Bible, there is
[1:46:11] no book of
[1:46:15] Baltas. There is a book of
[1:46:18] Daniel. God does not know the name they
[1:46:20] call us
[1:46:23] here. Amen. Amen. We are from his
[1:46:27] kingdom. We have his
[1:46:29] name. Amen. His character in us. He
[1:46:34] still calls us by
[1:46:36] that. Hallelujah. Amen. The Bible says
[1:46:40] that God calls us
[1:46:42] beloved. He calls us little children. He
[1:46:45] calls us
[1:46:47] blessed above all things. He calls us
[1:46:50] the apple of his
[1:46:52] eye.
[1:46:54] Hallelujah. Amen. So we should learn to
[1:46:57] reject these
[1:46:59] names that the the world is giving us
[1:47:02] that the devil is giving us. Hallelujah.
[1:47:06] Because Daniel did it.
[1:47:08] Daniel rejected what was offered unto
[1:47:11] him. Amen. We should also
[1:47:15] reject the devil's
[1:47:18] offers to our
[1:47:19] lives. Amen. Amen. Anything that comes
[1:47:22] from the
[1:47:24] devil, however much it looks like uh it
[1:47:28] is
[1:47:29] good, you have to reject
[1:47:32] it. Amen. Amen. Even if it is
[1:47:35] medicine and it comes from the devil,
[1:47:39] don't receive
[1:47:40] it. Amen. What disqualifies the
[1:47:44] medicine because it has come from the
[1:47:47] devil. Amen. Amen. The devil does not
[1:47:50] wish good and
[1:47:52] worse.
[1:47:54] Amen. Daniel rejected the the
[1:47:57] meat. Amen. He was typing that we should
[1:48:01] also reject
[1:48:05] the
[1:48:06] doctrines. Amen.
[1:48:09] Which are in this world. There are so
[1:48:11] many doctrines in this
[1:48:13] world. Amen. Amen. Concerning for
[1:48:16] example, let me say becoming
[1:48:19] rich is some some friend I
[1:48:23] had was preaching to
[1:48:26] me telling me in this
[1:48:29] world you can never be rich if you don't
[1:48:33] steal. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. It was it
[1:48:39] was the devil's
[1:48:42] meat. Amen. Amen. giving me his meat
[1:48:45] because he wants me to eat it.
[1:48:47] Hallelujah. There are so many things he
[1:48:50] gives us to
[1:48:51] eat. Amen. You can never have a
[1:48:54] successful marriage when you are
[1:48:57] young. You need to have you know the
[1:49:00] things the world says. You need to first
[1:49:03] enjoy the world. My
[1:49:04] brother, you will marry when you are
[1:49:06] aged
[1:49:07] there. That is the devil's meat. Amen.
[1:49:11] That is not our meat.
[1:49:13] Amen. We should not eat it. We should
[1:49:16] reject
[1:49:17] it. Amen.
[1:49:20] For
[1:49:20] example, the devil has brought
[1:49:23] sicknesses in our lives, poverty,
[1:49:28] depression,
[1:49:30] disappointments. Amen.
[1:49:33] Doubt he's offering it to us
[1:49:36] daily. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:40] Amen. Amen. I believe we all fight these
[1:49:44] battles. Amen. Often times you feel
[1:49:48] depressed. You feel
[1:49:50] disappointed. You've worked. You've
[1:49:53] worked. You don't see any
[1:49:56] breakthrough. When the devil preaches to
[1:49:59] you, ah that for you, you live to be
[1:50:03] disappointed. Hallelujah. Amen. Those
[1:50:06] are the devil's meat.
[1:50:10] We should learn to reject
[1:50:11] it. He does not stop there. He brings
[1:50:16] anger. Amen.
[1:50:18] Hatred,
[1:50:20] malice, he's offering it to
[1:50:23] us. Does God offer us
[1:50:27] anger? Does he offer us
[1:50:29] hatred or malice or sickness? Amen.
[1:50:34] These are these are things from the
[1:50:36] enemy. Amen. If you notice you are
[1:50:39] becoming you you feel like you are
[1:50:41] trying to hurt some
[1:50:43] person just know that the devil has
[1:50:48] assigned that
[1:50:50] demon come to
[1:50:52] you. Amen. You have to resist
[1:50:55] it. You have to reject it. Hallelujah.
[1:50:59] In James
[1:51:01] 4:7 the Bible says let's read there very
[1:51:05] fast.
[1:51:08] James 4:7
[1:51:15] James 4:7
[1:51:17] says, "Submit yourselves therefore to
[1:51:20] God. Resist the
[1:51:22] devil and he will flee from you."
[1:51:26] Hallelujah. You have to resist him.
[1:51:40] Notice he won't
[1:51:42] walk. He will flee. He will flee from
[1:51:46] you. Hallelujah. When you resist him,
[1:51:50] when you reject his
[1:51:51] offers, hallelujah. And after that, the
[1:51:55] Bible tells us that after they had
[1:51:58] rejected this
[1:52:00] meat, this drink from the table of the
[1:52:03] king, the Bible tells us that then God
[1:52:07] gave them
[1:52:09] favor. Amen. In
[1:52:11] Babylon, favor before the
[1:52:15] king. Amen. We also can get this
[1:52:20] favor. But for us to get this favor in
[1:52:22] this world,
[1:52:25] We have to first be
[1:52:28] obedient and we
[1:52:30] reject the
[1:52:32] offers that the devil is offering us.
[1:52:35] God cannot bless
[1:52:37] us before we first
[1:52:40] rejected. Hallelujah. The offers of the
[1:52:47] enemy. blessing those who reject Satan's
[1:52:54] offer with what is greater than what
[1:52:56] Satan
[1:52:58] offers. For example, Jesus when Satan
[1:53:01] came and tempted
[1:53:03] him, he offered him the
[1:53:06] kingdom. Hallelujah. What did Jesus do?
[1:53:10] He rejected that
[1:53:12] offer. Hallelujah. Why? Because the
[1:53:16] kingdom of the devil has an
[1:53:18] end. Hallelujah. And God gave
[1:53:22] Christ after he rejected that a kingdom
[1:53:26] without an
[1:53:27] end. Hallelujah. What does that tell us?
[1:53:31] That after we've rejected the devil's
[1:53:34] offers, God is going to give
[1:53:37] us. Amen. Amen. Which has no
[1:53:40] end. Amen. Amen. If you reject that
[1:53:43] worldly boyfriend or
[1:53:46] girlfriend, he will bless you with a
[1:53:48] genuine
[1:53:50] daughter. Oh son of God. But you have to
[1:53:54] first
[1:53:55] reject. Hallelujah. Often times the
[1:53:58] challenge we
[1:54:01] have, we don't reject the devil's
[1:54:05] offers and we try to pray God to give
[1:54:10] us. Amen. Amen. They can't. Darkness and
[1:54:13] light can't walk together.
[1:54:17] Amen. Amen. You have to choose one.
[1:54:20] Amen. Amen. The Bible
[1:54:23] says that Daniel told this
[1:54:27] un
[1:54:29] days, I'm sure, you will
[1:54:33] see that we shall be better than the
[1:54:35] other ones. We are preaching uh uh uh
[1:54:42] outdoor and uh brother Anga he was the
[1:54:45] one preach. He
[1:54:46] said that if you bring a
[1:54:49] person and you tell
[1:54:51] him you obey the word
[1:54:56] uh obey the word as it says you
[1:55:00] do and you bring another one and you
[1:55:02] tell him you don't do you don't follow
[1:55:06] anything in the word and you bring them
[1:55:09] after one
[1:55:10] year there will be a very big
[1:55:13] difference the one who will believe the
[1:55:16] word, you wouldn't compare
[1:55:19] him with the one who has rejected the
[1:55:22] word. Amen. It is what happened
[1:55:26] here because Daniel
[1:55:29] rejected the food which was offered unto
[1:55:32] him. Amen. And he decided not to eat
[1:55:36] it. Amen. And he ate the normal food.
[1:55:38] The name of was typing the word, typing
[1:55:41] the message.
[1:55:44] He was a better man. They were better
[1:55:47] children than all the others who
[1:55:50] accepted to eat the kings.
[1:55:55] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. The Bible
[1:56:03] says that following Christ
[1:56:07] produces the better quality of life.
[1:56:15] or the better quality of
[1:56:20] people. You know our leaders, they try
[1:56:24] to make
[1:56:25] laws to make sure people are in
[1:56:29] order. That won't work. Amen. Man was
[1:56:33] made to break the
[1:56:35] law. Amen. Imagine Adam had one law.
[1:56:43] Only one thing God told don't do
[1:56:45] it. He broke
[1:56:47] it. Just one. How many? And you think he
[1:56:52] will keep all these these
[1:56:54] many? He will just break
[1:56:58] them. Amen. Amen. Amen. Because that's
[1:57:01] his
[1:57:02] nature. Amen. Amen. It it does not take
[1:57:06] laws to produce a better kind of life.
[1:57:13] It takes
[1:57:14] Christ. It takes the
[1:57:16] word.
[1:57:19] Hallelujah. Even in marriage, the better
[1:57:22] kind of
[1:57:23] marriage is the marriage of the
[1:57:25] Christian.
[1:57:28] The better business,
[1:57:30] it is the business of the Christian.
[1:57:33] Hallelujah.
[1:57:34] What? What? Daniel, you remember what
[1:57:37] what what happened to Daniel?
[1:57:40] They had the better. They were fairer
[1:57:42] than all the
[1:57:44] others. Amen. Following
[1:57:48] Christ produces a more fulfilled
[1:57:56] life than all other ways of
[1:58:00] life. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't accept the
[1:58:04] reasons of the
[1:58:06] devil. Hallelujah. Remember what this un
[1:58:10] told
[1:58:11] them that you won't make
[1:58:19] it. You're going
[1:58:22] to enjoy the Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But
[1:58:28] they had that
[1:58:29] revelation. They knew that they were not
[1:58:31] of that kingdom.
[1:58:33] Hallelujah. We are not of this kingdom.
[1:58:36] We are not of this world. Like for them
[1:58:39] they were taken from
[1:58:41] Israel. The physical
[1:58:43] Israel they they were taken to
[1:58:46] Babylon. We are also we are just fallen
[1:58:49] here. We are not of this world. We are
[1:58:53] children of God. We came from God. We
[1:58:57] are just here to
[1:58:59] pastor. So we should have that
[1:59:01] revelation.
[1:59:02] Hallelujah. And we should reject the
[1:59:05] offers of the
[1:59:07] truth. Hallelujah. My message was Daniel
[1:59:11] in
[1:59:12] Babylon. Let me end with a
[1:59:17] quote. Amen.
[1:59:20] He
[1:59:21] says the message life story. He
[1:59:25] says, "And we each and we each one have
[1:59:29] a life that God has given
[1:59:33] [Music]
[1:59:35] us, we must live
[1:59:37] it." And I to my humble
[1:59:43] opinion if you will get
[1:59:46] this I think the best life in the
[1:59:51] world the best life in the
[1:59:55] world no matter whether it's up or
[2:00:01] down if you will find God's
[2:00:05] path and walk in it where God has
[2:00:08] ordained
[2:00:11] us to
[2:00:13] walk. If we
[2:00:15] always if we always walk in that way
[2:00:18] that God has ordained for us to walk
[2:00:22] in we find
[2:00:26] victory no
[2:00:28] matter.
[2:00:30] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:33] God bless you.
[2:00:41] Hallelujah.
[2:00:43] God bless you.
