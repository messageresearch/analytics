[1:12:27] Um, as you prepare your Bible to open
[1:12:29] into the book of
[1:12:35] Lamentation now, I've uh I've preached
[1:12:38] for
[1:12:40] um I've been thinking close to 20
[1:12:46] years. Uh but I've never felt
[1:12:51] uh relaxed when I come to speak to the
[1:12:53] children of God.
[1:12:59] I'm always
[1:13:00] nervous whether it's a little group or a
[1:13:03] huge
[1:13:04] group. I preach to a
[1:13:07] hundred
[1:13:09] thousand, a few hundred if a
[1:13:12] couple usually I'm
[1:13:16] nervous. That's why many times I I
[1:13:20] worship you can see me away from this
[1:13:23] reality, our reality.
[1:13:25] and I get to his
[1:13:27] reality. It is so beautiful when you
[1:13:29] know you are hearing from
[1:13:32] God. And today I was just waiting
[1:13:35] because I know my wife was outside. Is
[1:13:37] she in

[1:14:22] after you know 12 years I don't know
[1:14:24] what
[1:14:26] happened also she told me dear you are
[1:14:29] also
[1:14:33] getting she says she can't find it but
[1:14:36] she picked a gray hair
[1:14:39] also I think it's not because we are
[1:14:42] very
[1:14:43] old the responsibility on our
[1:14:47] shoulders, you know, is giving us making
[1:14:49] us overwork. But I want to thank

[1:25:29] Hallelujah. Oh, thank you
[1:25:32] Jesus. You have a reason to worship him
[1:25:34] if you are. You are grateful.
[1:25:37] If you're
[1:25:39] grateful for what he's even about to
[1:25:42] do, you don't worship him because he has
[1:25:44] done
[1:25:45] something. You worship him because he's
[1:25:47] about to do
[1:25:49] something. and worship him because you
[1:25:51] know he's
[1:25:52] faithful to fulfill every promise he has
[1:25:57] made. Let a
[1:26:00] worship arise.
[1:26:07] Let our sons and the daughters
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:15] sing. I surrender in my
[1:26:23] own. I surrender to the
[1:26:30] king. Worship him with me now.
[1:26:33] Oh little
[1:26:35] worshipers
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:41] around little sons and the daughter
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:45] [Laughter]
[1:26:47] see.
[1:26:49] Hallelujah. I surrender in my own.
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:57] Oh, I surrender to the
[1:27:02] king. Lift up your hands and sing it
[1:27:05] again. Let our worshipers.
[1:27:09] Oh
[1:27:10] yes. Let them arise this morning.
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:17] Oh, if you're a son and you a daughter,
[1:27:19] you have a reason to sing this morning
[1:27:21] and worship him. Oh, hallelujah. Thank
[1:27:25] you
[1:27:26] Jesus. My
[1:27:28] oh I surrender to the Oh, sing it one
[1:27:33] last time everybody. Let our worship.
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:41] Oh let him
[1:27:43] run. Let the sun and the
[1:27:49] sing. I surrender Lord. I surrender in
[1:27:54] my
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:27:56] home.
[1:27:58] Oh, I surrender to you.
[1:28:08] Lord Jesus,
[1:28:11] we are going to speak about your
[1:28:13] faithfulness.
[1:28:17] It is because we are
[1:28:19] convinced beyond reasonable
[1:28:23] doubt that you have been
[1:28:28] proven overseas and ages and
[1:28:32] times that you are
[1:28:35] faithful. You have never spoken a word.
[1:28:37] You never
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:40] act. You have said you are coming back
[1:28:42] for
[1:28:43] us. Lord, we are waiting and we are
[1:28:47] believing and we know you will make your
[1:28:50] word
[1:28:52] good. There are many things you have
[1:28:54] promised to each of us as
[1:28:57] leaders. Many are waiting. Many are
[1:29:01] believing. And Lord, tonight we just
[1:29:03] want to encourage
[1:29:05] ourselves and remind each other about
[1:29:08] your faithfulness.
[1:29:10] Have your way with us this
[1:29:12] morning and let your word have
[1:29:15] frequency. Give us a good
[1:29:18] atmosphere that your word shall be
[1:29:20] preached and shall be received by
[1:29:24] waiting. Grant it Lord in the name of
[1:29:29] Jesus. Amen.
[1:29:35] Amen. I'd like to invite you to
[1:29:38] Lamentations chapter 3.
[1:29:48] We will read from verses 19.
[1:30:37] If you're there, just say amen.
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:55] 21 I'm reading in the name of the
[1:31:01] Lord. Remembering mine affliction and my
[1:31:04] misery, the wood and the
[1:31:07] g my soul has
[1:31:10] them still in remembrance and is humbled
[1:31:15] in me. This I recall to my mind.
[1:31:20] Therefore have I hope.
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:51] vers 22.
[1:31:53] It is of the Lord's mercies that we are
[1:31:56] not
[1:31:57] consumed because his compassions fail
[1:32:01] not.
[1:32:03] They are new every morning. Great is thy
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:21] faithfulness. The Lord is my portion,
[1:32:24] saith my soul. Therefore will I hope in
[1:32:27] him. The Lord is good unto them that
[1:32:30] wait for him to the soul that seeketh
[1:32:33] him. It is good that a man should both
[1:32:36] hope and quietly wait for the salvation
[1:32:39] of the Lord. It is good for a man that
[1:32:42] he bear the yoke in his youth.
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:16] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:19] Amen.
[1:33:26] Before I forget, we have a minister's
[1:33:31] meeting next Sunday after
[1:33:36] and also this morning um uh I mean after
[1:33:40] the service we are going to of course go
[1:33:42] to but we have a few people who want to
[1:33:43] be
[1:33:47] baptized. I don't know whether the
[1:33:50] brothers are
[1:33:52] here. Oh, you're one of them.
[1:33:54] Yes. And then this brother, we had
[1:33:58] several in the church. I don't know if
[1:33:59] they are
[1:34:02] here that needed to be
[1:34:05] baptized. These brothers want to be
[1:34:08] baptized in a
[1:34:10] lake. So I told them it it doesn't
[1:34:13] really matter.
[1:34:16] could be a lake or could be a swimming
[1:34:20] pool. It could be anything as long as
[1:34:22] there's much
[1:34:24] water. But again, if someone's conscious
[1:34:30] uh feels that they should be baptized in
[1:34:33] in a in a moving
[1:34:37] water because John baptized in
[1:34:41] Jordan, it is perfectly
[1:34:43] open. So we can always do
[1:34:47] that. So we will have that baptism
[1:34:50] service
[1:34:51] in and then afterwards we have the
[1:34:54] service.
[1:34:56] So this morning I just want you to uh
[1:34:58] please give me your undivided
[1:35:02] attention. We try to avoid uh movement
[1:35:06] as much as we possibly
[1:35:11] can. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:14] I'm happy to see you, Sister Ruth.
[1:35:17] Always praying for
[1:35:18] you. I know it's not easy, but I know
[1:35:22] God is your
[1:35:25] portion. So, I'm speaking today on the
[1:35:27] faithfulness of
[1:35:31] God. Nice to see you,
[1:35:35] sister. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them
[1:35:37] God is
[1:35:39] faithful. God is faithful.
[1:35:42] God is
[1:35:43] faithful. Did your neighbor hear
[1:35:48] that? Brother Brian, I want to tell you,
[1:35:51] God is
[1:35:54] faithful. My sister, God is
[1:35:57] faithful. God is always
[1:36:00] faithful. Amen. We are not always
[1:36:04] faithful, but God is
[1:36:09] always. And um like I said, I just need
[1:36:12] cuz we're going to delve into the
[1:36:15] different
[1:36:18] scriptures. Uh you know, when we come to
[1:36:20] a Sunday service like
[1:36:22] this, I know uh we are always rushing it
[1:36:25] through so we don't get to bore you or
[1:36:27] take very long and then you get
[1:36:32] tired. Um I'm not one person who
[1:36:35] believes that you should keep the people
[1:36:36] very long so that they can get so much
[1:36:42] No, I I I believe that you should get
[1:36:44] what God has reserved for
[1:36:48] you. But um being that it is a
[1:36:52] Sunday and many of you don't appear here
[1:36:54] on the
[1:36:57] weekdays, you come to church
[1:37:00] relaxed. Don't rush the
[1:37:03] preacher. If you rush me, I can feel
[1:37:07] it and it can affect the way I I give
[1:37:11] you what God has prepared for
[1:37:15] you. But if you are relaxed and you are
[1:37:18] waiting and expecting to hear from the
[1:37:21] Lord and you are giving God
[1:37:23] time, I can also feel it. Uh, by the
[1:37:27] way, every preacher
[1:37:29] can and then it will affect me in a
[1:37:33] positive
[1:37:35] way. If you're moving out and
[1:37:39] and it shows me you you are
[1:37:43] restless and that also gets to affect me
[1:37:47] negatively and you know um there are
[1:37:50] people when the God is really dealing
[1:37:52] with your
[1:37:55] issue or when you feel he's about touch
[1:37:58] your
[1:37:59] issue then whatever tells you get
[1:38:04] out you go
[1:38:06] and you have listened to the
[1:38:08] devil. Sometimes you think the preacher
[1:38:10] is talking about
[1:38:12] me as in I think he knows or heard about
[1:38:16] me. Actually me when I hear something
[1:38:19] about someone I don't bring it to the
[1:38:22] pool. I bring it to them
[1:38:26] personally. So you should always feel
[1:38:28] relaxed in the house of God.
[1:38:30] If you feel God is addressing your
[1:38:33] issue, receive it
[1:38:35] wholeheartedly and be ready to to to you
[1:38:38] know do what the Lord wants you to
[1:38:41] do and you cannot regret
[1:38:44] it. Is it amen? So please let me have
[1:38:49] much attentiveness as
[1:38:52] possible so that the Lord will help us.
[1:38:56] So we are speaking on the subject of the
[1:38:59] faithfulness of
[1:39:03] God. This is the first time for me to
[1:39:06] preach out of the book of
[1:39:09] lamentation. The lamentations of
[1:39:13] Jeremiah. Um maybe I can just give a
[1:39:16] little synopsis of this
[1:39:19] book. We are looking at a
[1:39:22] time around 588
[1:39:28] BC. You know, and despite the warnings
[1:39:31] of God through prophet
[1:39:35] Jeremiah, he was warning the
[1:39:37] Jews, despite God's several
[1:39:41] warnings, they did not stop their
[1:39:45] sin. They did not stop their sin. And
[1:39:48] yet God had warned them many, many times
[1:39:50] over and
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:52] over through Jeremiah, but they did not
[1:39:56] stop their
[1:39:57] sin. There are always consequences for
[1:40:03] sin. Tell your neighbor, there are
[1:40:04] always con consequences.
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:10] So at the writing of this
[1:40:13] book, God is weeping for Israel through
[1:40:17] his prophet Jeremiah.
[1:40:29] But at the same
[1:40:31] time he was displaying sorrow. God
[1:40:34] himself was displaying his
[1:40:37] sorrow and he was displaying his
[1:40:41] love through God's prophet Jeremiah his
[1:40:47] mountain. The same prophets that had
[1:40:49] prophesied judgments upon
[1:40:53] Israel before its occurrence. The same
[1:40:57] prophet is
[1:40:59] weeping because Israel is going through
[1:41:02] the chesting of
[1:41:05] God. Who
[1:41:07] prophesied? It was not the prophet. It
[1:41:10] was God speaking through the
[1:41:12] prophet who was weeping. It was not the
[1:41:15] man. It was God
[1:41:18] weeping for Israel. And he because of
[1:41:21] the love he had for
[1:41:23] them. It's like a parent, a father or
[1:41:25] mother.
[1:41:27] who takes a child. The other time I took
[1:41:29] Eddie
[1:41:30] who I love him so much. When I see
[1:41:34] something is going to become something
[1:41:36] else. The Bible says foolishness is
[1:41:39] bound in the heart of a
[1:41:42] child. But the road of correction shall
[1:41:44] drive it
[1:41:47] out. Not only prayer, not only preaching
[1:41:50] the word. Sometimes you have to apply
[1:41:53] the road.
[1:41:56] Yes, physical
[1:41:57] road as much as you also apply the
[1:42:00] spiritual
[1:42:01] road. So I took him and I said now it is
[1:42:05] time for us to drive out this
[1:42:07] foolishness and then I took the road and
[1:42:11] hear him
[1:42:12] seriously and he began crying and
[1:42:18] crying looking at me
[1:42:20] with love and all that. I felt bad in my
[1:42:25] heart that my boy was crying like that
[1:42:28] and I was the one who was inflicting the
[1:42:30] pain on
[1:42:32] him. But I felt good because I was
[1:42:35] correcting him but at the same time I
[1:42:39] felt bad because he was feeling bad and
[1:42:43] that's the same way God
[1:42:45] feels. He doesn't like to bring pain on
[1:42:49] us. He doesn't like to judge us.
[1:42:53] He doesn't like to beat us, but he
[1:42:56] always beats
[1:42:58] us. He always judges us. He always
[1:43:02] chastises
[1:43:03] us when we fail to correct
[1:43:07] ourselves. Yes, God is a God of
[1:43:10] love. But the same God of
[1:43:13] love, if you do not take heed to his
[1:43:17] word and you find yourself in places
[1:43:20] where his word told you not to go,
[1:43:24] He will rebuke you. He will chastise
[1:43:27] you. And trust me, the chastising of the
[1:43:29] Lord is never
[1:43:32] sweet. It is never sweet. It is painful.
[1:43:36] You feel it. But you see, he loves you.
[1:43:40] That's why he does it. He says in the
[1:43:42] book of Revelation, "As many as I
[1:43:45] love, I rebuke and chasten.
[1:43:50] and
[1:43:52] repent. So if you a child of
[1:43:55] God, the devil cannot correct you on
[1:43:57] behalf of
[1:43:58] God. God himself will correct
[1:44:01] you. But you see his
[1:44:04] correction is not as sweet as his
[1:44:10] love. Don't be on the bad side of
[1:44:15] God. We see I want us to first examine
[1:44:18] this Israel.
[1:44:20] Israel was a nation that God had
[1:44:24] chosen. Let us go back to the
[1:44:26] beginning in the book of Genesis
[1:44:29] 12:1. Now the Lord had said unto
[1:44:31] Abraham, "Get thee out of thy country,
[1:44:35] and from thy kind, and from thy father's
[1:44:38] house to the land I will show
[1:44:41] thee, and I will make of thee a great
[1:44:45] nation." When God calls you,
[1:44:48] It is because he wants you to be
[1:44:52] great. There is no child of God that
[1:44:55] should be a
[1:44:57] tail. Every child of God must be the
[1:45:02] head must be great. You must prophesy
[1:45:06] over yourself and say I must be
[1:45:09] great. They want he wanted them to be a
[1:45:12] great
[1:45:13] nation. Whatever Israel is in the
[1:45:16] natural, the church, the gentile church
[1:45:19] is in the
[1:45:21] spiritual. And I will bless thee, and I
[1:45:25] will make your name
[1:45:26] great, and you will be a blessing, and I
[1:45:30] will bless them that bless
[1:45:32] thee, and cast them that casteth
[1:45:35] thee. And in thee shall all the families
[1:45:38] of the earth be blessed.
[1:45:44] This was the promise of
[1:45:47] God for Israel. When he gave it, it was
[1:45:52] not dependent on how Israel
[1:45:57] felt. Abraham just received it because
[1:46:01] God gave it. But you see, God did not
[1:46:04] say if you do this, you will be a
[1:46:07] blessing. If you do this, whoever will
[1:46:11] will cast you, I'll cast. If you do
[1:46:14] this, whoever blesses you, I'll bless
[1:46:16] you. If you do this, you will be a great
[1:46:19] nation. He never said that. This was not
[1:46:22] a conditional promise or
[1:46:26] covenant. God simply gave
[1:46:29] it because of
[1:46:32] election. And we know that the proof of
[1:46:35] God is love.
[1:46:38] his
[1:46:39] election. Amen. He chose me in him
[1:46:44] before the foundation of the world and I
[1:46:46] am here in the
[1:46:48] world. I'm manifested son of
[1:46:52] God. Meaning on my head I carry that
[1:46:57] promise. On my head I carry that
[1:47:01] confidence. I may feel it. I may not
[1:47:04] feel it. that does not change the
[1:47:08] fact. This is not an emotional
[1:47:11] covenant. It is a covenant that God has
[1:47:14] given
[1:47:18] regardless. Praise the name of the
[1:47:20] Lord. Sometimes I'm like, I remove my
[1:47:25] court. But when things begin to
[1:47:28] happen, I don't know what happens. Can
[1:47:31] we get into this church?
[1:47:33] So he says, "I'll make thee a great
[1:47:36] nation and I will bless thee and I will
[1:47:39] make your name great and thou shalt be a
[1:47:44] blessing." Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:47:47] I want you to see those three four
[1:47:49] things. Number one, he says, "I will
[1:47:52] make your nation. I will make you a
[1:47:53] great
[1:47:54] nation. I believe that for myself. I
[1:47:58] will bless you. I will make your name
[1:48:00] great and you will be a blessing.
[1:48:03] Do you believe that for yourself?
[1:48:06] If you believe it for yourself, let's do
[1:48:07] some preaching together. I want you to
[1:48:10] say, "I will be a great
[1:48:13] nation. I am
[1:48:15] blessed." He will make my name great. I
[1:48:18] will be a
[1:48:20] blessing. And then he says, "I will
[1:48:24] bless those that bless you and I will
[1:48:26] cast them that cast me. I cannot be
[1:48:30] cursed because I am already
[1:48:34] blessed. Now that's not subject to my
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:40] feeling. Subject to his
[1:48:43] covenant. Listen in the book of numbers.
[1:48:48] when one person now tried to come and
[1:48:50] and curse
[1:48:52] Israel, he was an a prophet a
[1:48:56] herring and you know he had you know
[1:48:59] been hired to come and c
[1:49:02] Israel you know it doesn't matter what
[1:49:05] the devil plans against the
[1:49:07] church the church of Jesus will
[1:49:11] stand the church of Jesus cannot
[1:49:14] fall the church of Jesus cannot be
[1:49:16] removed
[1:49:18] The church is not a building. The church
[1:49:21] are a
[1:49:22] people. The devil will throw many things
[1:49:24] at
[1:49:25] us. But we cannot
[1:49:28] fall. We cannot be
[1:49:30] destroyed. I am not the one making the
[1:49:33] church stand. I am not the one who
[1:49:35] called you. I am not the one who
[1:49:37] established you. It is God who called
[1:49:40] you. It is God who establish you. It is
[1:49:43] God who is interested in
[1:49:45] you. And you because you are the church
[1:49:47] of
[1:49:48] God. And so we see here
[1:49:51] Israel as the church physical church of
[1:49:55] God was you know the devil wanted to
[1:49:57] cast
[1:49:58] them through prophet
[1:50:00] Balac the king Balac
[1:50:03] rather and prophet
[1:50:06] Balam who was
[1:50:09] anointed came down to cast
[1:50:12] them. And then he went to ask God and
[1:50:16] He said, "Should I cast them?" God said,
[1:50:20] "No." He said, "Should I cast them
[1:50:22] again?" God said, "Okay, you can go."
[1:50:26] But we we know what
[1:50:27] happened. And on verses
[1:50:31] 20, the man who was hired to
[1:50:35] cast in numbers 23, I wanted to hear the
[1:50:39] words he is speaking.
[1:50:42] Behold, I have received commandment to
[1:50:45] bless, and he has
[1:50:49] blessed and I cannot reverse it.
[1:50:55] Did you hear that
[1:50:56] verse? Don't hear it can
[1:51:00] hear. I have received commandment to
[1:51:05] bless and he has blessed and I cannot
[1:51:09] reverse it.
[1:51:11] No
[1:51:12] preacher, no anointed man of God can
[1:51:16] reverse your
[1:51:18] blessing. That is why our
[1:51:22] salvation is not hooked to a church or
[1:51:28] organization. Some people think if we
[1:51:30] leave
[1:51:31] them we shall be cast or if you leave
[1:51:35] DVF you shall be cast. That can never
[1:51:38] happen to you.
[1:51:41] Because your blessing is not tied to a
[1:51:44] system or a church or a
[1:51:48] man. Even if the man is
[1:51:52] anointed, my
[1:51:54] blessing is tied to the
[1:51:57] word is tied to the
[1:52:00] covenant. and go and you know the
[1:52:03] anointed
[1:52:04] man he came and he
[1:52:07] said I have received commandment to
[1:52:10] bless he has blessed I cannot reverse
[1:52:15] the blessing I have for my
[1:52:17] life cannot be
[1:52:20] reversed it does not mean I'll not go
[1:52:22] through
[1:52:23] things I can but the blessing cannot be
[1:52:29] reversed Amen. Let's build it. It says,
[1:52:33] "He has not beheld iniquity in
[1:52:38] Jacob. There is therefore now no
[1:52:43] condemnation to them that are in
[1:52:47] Christ. There is no
[1:52:50] condemnation. You are not
[1:52:52] condemned." Meaning you are accepted in
[1:52:55] the
[1:52:57] blood there. Amen. He he he speaks the
[1:53:00] same thing about
[1:53:02] Jacob. He says, "I've received I beheld
[1:53:05] no iniquity in
[1:53:07] Jacob." And I want you to imagine this.
[1:53:11] He He did not say I have He did not say
[1:53:13] I He has not beheld iniquity in
[1:53:17] Israel. He says he has not beheld
[1:53:20] iniquity in
[1:53:21] Jacob. Do you understand this? Jacob
[1:53:25] before he even
[1:53:27] changed before the
[1:53:30] conversion God did not see any iniquity
[1:53:32] in
[1:53:34] him. Why? Because of the
[1:53:37] covenant. It cannot be removed. It
[1:53:41] cannot be deleted. Some cannot be
[1:53:45] reversed. This is the secret of our
[1:53:48] Christian
[1:53:52] faith. To know who we are. Listen, he
[1:53:55] has not beheld iniquity in
[1:53:57] Jacob, neither has he seen perversess in
[1:54:04] Israel. The Lord is his God. The Lord
[1:54:07] his God is with
[1:54:09] him. The Lord his God is with
[1:54:12] him. The Lord my God is with
[1:54:17] me. This is not just written about
[1:54:20] Israel.
[1:54:23] It is also written about the church
[1:54:26] today. The Lord our God is with
[1:54:30] us. The Lord my God is with
[1:54:33] me. And the shout of the king is among
[1:54:38] them. That's why we shout. That's why we
[1:54:41] rejoice when we begin opening the pages
[1:54:44] of the word and reading about the
[1:54:47] promises. Amen. There's a shout of the
[1:54:49] king in the car.
[1:54:52] God brought them out of
[1:54:54] Egypt. He He has, as it were, the
[1:54:58] strength of a an unicorn.
[1:55:01] [Music]
[1:55:06] Surely there is no enchantment against
[1:55:12] Israel. There is no enchantment against
[1:55:15] Jacob. Neither is there any divination
[1:55:18] against Israel.
[1:55:20] According to this
[1:55:22] time, it shall be said of Jacob and of
[1:55:25] Israel. What has God wrote?
[1:55:32] What has he has he wrote? Behold, the
[1:55:36] people shall rise up as a great
[1:55:40] lion and lift up
[1:55:43] himself as a a young lion. He shall not
[1:55:47] lie down until he eat of the
[1:55:51] prey and drink of the blood of the
[1:55:54] slave. Who are we? We are
[1:55:58] lionesses. Why? Because our husband is a
[1:56:01] lion of the tribe of
[1:56:07] Judah. Now
[1:56:10] uh Israel could not be
[1:56:13] cast because Israel was blessed.
[1:56:19] And uh we we then begin to
[1:56:22] see that the people Israel now we've
[1:56:27] seen the
[1:56:28] foundation of the covenant and of the
[1:56:31] blessing and this is this also applies
[1:56:34] to
[1:56:37] us. He says there is no mistake in
[1:56:42] me. I don't care which mistake you
[1:56:44] see. There's no error. There's no
[1:56:49] sin. When God sees
[1:56:51] me, he sees
[1:56:54] perfection. When God sees me, he sees
[1:56:58] purity. And he said he's coming back for
[1:57:01] me. He said, "I have no spot. I have no
[1:57:05] wrinkle. I am washed in the
[1:57:08] blood." That's how he sees me.
[1:57:12] He sees me as
[1:57:13] perfect. He sees me as holy. He sees me
[1:57:17] as
[1:57:18] ready. You know in the book of
[1:57:20] revelation 19 it says the marriage 79
[1:57:23] the marriage of the lamb is
[1:57:26] come. And his wife has made herself
[1:57:30] ready. So he sees me as
[1:57:33] ready. I am ready to meet him in
[1:57:36] the Are you
[1:57:39] ready now? The devil will tell you,
[1:57:42] "What about this? What about that? What
[1:57:43] about that?" He says, "No, actually God
[1:57:46] does not see those
[1:57:48] things." Because his
[1:57:50] covenant, he gave it to me
[1:57:53] regardless. If I am an
[1:58:00] elects that will qualify
[1:58:03] me, he qualified
[1:58:06] me before I knew that I was.
[1:58:10] Now we see here that's also how Israel
[1:58:14] is. By the way, if you type it, you will
[1:58:17] type it also with Israel, you will see
[1:58:18] that they were surely the
[1:58:24] elect and no amount of curses could
[1:58:27] could reverse the
[1:58:31] blessing. Whatever God said about
[1:58:34] them, he will make it good.
[1:58:38] Now we see by and by in the days of
[1:58:41] prophet
[1:58:42] Jeremiah more than 500 years before the
[1:58:45] coming of
[1:58:46] Christ Israel
[1:58:50] sinned Israel sinned against
[1:58:54] God. So now because you see and I've
[1:58:57] taken a few
[1:58:58] weeks preaching grace and election and
[1:59:01] all
[1:59:03] this but you see we do not preach
[1:59:06] disgrace.
[1:59:10] because you see many people would now
[1:59:11] say
[1:59:12] ah it's what God says I
[1:59:17] am even if I'm I'm having this thing
[1:59:19] it's all right he doesn't see it now
[1:59:23] it's the same way with
[1:59:25] Israel but I want us to
[1:59:27] understand what is pure
[1:59:30] grace pure grace will make you turn away
[1:59:34] from your sin
[1:59:38] Pure grace will make you do his
[1:59:43] will. It will not be you doing his
[1:59:46] will. It will be him in you fulfilling
[1:59:49] his
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:52] word. Pure grace will give you
[1:59:56] faith as a
[1:59:58] gift is the gift of
[2:00:01] God. It's by grace through faith.
[2:00:05] the faith of the son of God. So when he
[2:00:08] places that faith, you know, he gives it
[2:00:10] to you as a
[2:00:12] gift. So when you receive that faith in
[2:00:14] your
[2:00:15] heart, it's not your faith. No, it is
[2:00:19] his faith in
[2:00:20] you. He is actually living in you to
[2:00:24] fulfill his
[2:00:26] word. But many times people don't hunger
[2:00:30] and thirst for him.
[2:00:33] There is no enough hungering in the
[2:00:35] church. There is no enough fasting for
[2:00:38] the things of
[2:00:40] God. How can he give you these
[2:00:43] things? How can he give you the grace
[2:00:46] that overcomes the
[2:00:47] world? If you are not hungering for it,
[2:00:51] if you're not thirsting for
[2:00:53] it, he's not going to find you about
[2:00:55] going your business.
[2:00:58] Yes, you are
[2:00:59] unelect. But you must
[2:01:01] hunger for what he has prepared for
[2:01:05] you. No, I has
[2:01:07] seen. No man knows the things that God
[2:01:11] has
[2:01:13] prepared. There is more in
[2:01:16] God. We have not seen yet. But we have
[2:01:19] to hunger. We have to fast
[2:01:22] after hungering and fasting after
[2:01:25] righteousness.
[2:01:28] Why? Because
[2:01:29] righteousness is not worked by your own
[2:01:32] works. Righteousness is given to
[2:01:36] you. It is imputed unto you to be
[2:01:40] righteous. You have to hunger and
[2:01:43] thirst. To be able to receive
[2:01:46] righteousness, not your righteousness,
[2:01:50] his are you hearing me, church? Now,
[2:01:53] when that happens, how does it happen?
[2:01:56] Of course, through
[2:01:58] prayer, through desire for the
[2:02:01] word, through coming to
[2:02:03] church, through
[2:02:05] praying. Not only when you come to
[2:02:08] church, you always pray for
[2:02:12] revelation. Pray for God to reveal more
[2:02:14] of
[2:02:15] himself. Have a personal walk with
[2:02:19] him. Not a church religious
[2:02:22] walk, but a personal relationship with
[2:02:25] him.
[2:02:28] Now
[2:02:30] Israel well they knew we are the people
[2:02:32] of
[2:02:33] God. We are blessed. No one can c us.
[2:02:38] They can even give
[2:02:40] examples. He balam
[2:02:42] tried. It never worked out. We cannot be
[2:02:46] cast. Wait wait wait
[2:02:48] wait. There are certain things you will
[2:02:52] do and they will have consequences in
[2:02:55] your
[2:02:56] [Music]
[2:02:58] life. And I want us to use the example
[2:03:01] of
[2:03:02] Israel in Jeremiah
[2:03:05] 19. Thus say the
[2:03:07] Lord, go and get a potter's athen
[2:03:15] botm and take of the ancients of the
[2:03:20] people and of the ancients of the
[2:03:23] priests, and go forth unto the valley of
[2:03:26] the son of
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:29] Hon, which is by the entry of the east
[2:03:32] gate,
[2:03:35] I proclaim there the words that I shall
[2:03:37] tell
[2:03:39] you. Why is God now deploying prophet
[2:03:44] Jeremiah? Because Israel had
[2:03:49] sinned. Israel had done things that God
[2:03:52] was not displeased
[2:03:54] with. They had not heckened to the word.
[2:03:58] They were doing whatever they wanted to
[2:04:00] do.
[2:04:01] So now he told the prophet go to this
[2:04:04] place and I'll tell you what to
[2:04:07] say
[2:04:09] listen. And when he reached
[2:04:12] there he began
[2:04:16] prophesying and say hear ye the word of
[2:04:20] the
[2:04:21] Lord. Oh kings of
[2:04:23] Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem.
[2:04:27] Thus saith the Lord of hosts.
[2:04:31] the God of Israel. Behold, I will bring
[2:04:36] evil upon this
[2:04:38] place. The which whosoever
[2:04:43] heareth, his ears shall tingle.
[2:04:48] God cannot c
[2:04:52] you but your
[2:04:55] atmosphere will be
[2:04:57] cast because of the life you
[2:05:04] live. When he came to his son Adam, he
[2:05:07] never cast you but said cast me the
[2:05:11] ground. He shall bring
[2:05:13] thorns and you will kill
[2:05:17] it. Why? Because of his
[2:05:21] lifestyle. But that did not change who
[2:05:24] Adam
[2:05:27] was. But there were consequences of
[2:05:32] sin. Sin had consequences in the
[2:05:36] beginning. Sin has consequences
[2:05:40] today. And then he said to them, "Tell
[2:05:44] them, I bring evil upon this
[2:05:47] place. The witch whosoever heareth, his
[2:05:50] ears shall
[2:05:53] tingle." If you walk the way you want to
[2:05:55] walk, God can allow things to happen in
[2:05:58] your
[2:05:58] life that will shock you and shock
[2:06:03] everyone. Things that are
[2:06:05] bad because they have forsaken me. Now
[2:06:10] God begins to give the reasons why he
[2:06:12] would do
[2:06:15] that. Because they have forsaken me and
[2:06:18] they have enrained this
[2:06:21] place and they have Yeah. And they have
[2:06:24] burned incency unto other
[2:06:27] gods whom neither they nor their fathers
[2:06:30] have
[2:06:32] known, nor the kings of
[2:06:34] Judah. And they have filled this place
[2:06:37] with the blood of innocence.
[2:06:42] If people began killing children as
[2:06:46] sacrifices, they worshiped other
[2:06:48] gods. God never told them to do this
[2:06:51] thing. But they did it because of
[2:06:54] unbelief. And he says they have built
[2:06:57] also the high places of
[2:07:00] B to burn their
[2:07:03] sons with fire for burnt offerings and
[2:07:06] to burn
[2:07:09] I commanded
[2:07:10] not nor spake it. Neither came it unto
[2:07:14] my
[2:07:15] mind. Because God is saying, I never
[2:07:18] thought
[2:07:19] this. I never said it, but the people
[2:07:22] did it. And because of this, I am
[2:07:26] reigning my
[2:07:28] judgment. The Bible says God is a
[2:07:32] righteous judge.
[2:07:35] God can never judge you
[2:07:39] wrongly. If you fulfill your
[2:07:41] life, you're under the judgment hand of
[2:07:45] God. Search your
[2:07:47] life. Put yourself right with
[2:07:50] God. If things are not going
[2:07:53] well, search yourself because God is
[2:07:56] faithful.
[2:07:58] God is faithful to
[2:08:00] bless but also it rains a
[2:08:03] curse on your
[2:08:06] circumstances on your
[2:08:08] situation because you don't deal well
[2:08:10] with the
[2:08:12] money according to the word according to
[2:08:15] the way he's saying you will have
[2:08:17] problems in your
[2:08:19] finances and then you will cry you will
[2:08:21] cry you'll cry you are blessed but your
[2:08:24] finances are
[2:08:26] cut you are blessed
[2:08:28] But your children, you are blessed. But
[2:08:32] your family, you are blessed. But your
[2:08:34] job, you are blessed. But things are not
[2:08:38] well. Why? God is
[2:08:41] faithful. Always search your
[2:08:43] life. Because God is
[2:08:46] faithful. So he cast
[2:08:48] Israel. He said, "I'll cast this
[2:08:51] place because they have brought these
[2:08:53] things
[2:08:54] here, things I never spoke. things I
[2:08:58] never thought. Brother, sister, let us
[2:09:01] know what God said and what God
[2:09:05] thinks. Meaning, let us know the will of
[2:09:09] God before we do
[2:09:14] anything. Jeremiah
[2:09:17] 7:23, what does he say? But this thing I
[2:09:21] commanded I commanded
[2:09:23] them saying obey my
[2:09:27] voice and I will be your God and he
[2:09:30] shall be my people and walk ye in all
[2:09:33] the ways which I commanded
[2:09:35] you that it may be well with
[2:09:38] you. So you can actually be
[2:09:41] blessed. But when it is not well with
[2:09:45] you, how can it be well with you?
[2:09:49] walk in his
[2:09:52] ways. If you walk in the ways of
[2:09:55] God, oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[2:09:58] guarantee you, brother, sister, it shall
[2:10:01] be well with
[2:10:03] you. But if you go out there and you are
[2:10:07] not walking according to the ways of
[2:10:09] God, a prophet may
[2:10:12] prophesy, it is well with you, you shall
[2:10:14] prosper. I said, I said it. It will be
[2:10:18] words falling on idle
[2:10:22] [Music]
[2:10:23] ground. Nothing will
[2:10:25] happen. It can only be well with
[2:10:28] you if you obey his
[2:10:32] voice. He says, "Obey my
[2:10:35] voice. I will be your God and we shall
[2:10:38] be my people and I and walk ye in all
[2:10:42] the
[2:10:43] ways I have commanded you."
[2:10:46] The ways of God are the ways of the
[2:10:52] word. The things you do, what does the
[2:10:55] word say
[2:10:56] about the
[2:10:59] church? What does the Bible say about
[2:11:02] that? What is the voice of
[2:11:05] God? We have a voice in this
[2:11:08] generation. The voice of God at the time
[2:11:11] was the prophets. The voice of God this
[2:11:13] time is the prophet
[2:11:16] We have a
[2:11:17] prophet from Malachi 4. Revelation 10:7.
[2:11:22] He has that sayeth the Lord to our
[2:11:25] generation. Don't interpret the Bible by
[2:11:28] yourself. God is his own divine
[2:11:32] interpreter and he uses
[2:11:35] prophets and we have received one
[2:11:41] now. But they hecken
[2:11:43] not. They didn't incline their ear. They
[2:11:46] nor inclined their
[2:11:49] ear but walked listen but walked in the
[2:11:53] councils and in the imagination of their
[2:11:55] evil
[2:11:56] [Music]
[2:12:01] heart. The word of God tells you under
[2:12:04] no
[2:12:06] circumstance should I believe an
[2:12:08] unbeliever and then your evil
[2:12:11] heart. It makes you to imagine
[2:12:15] God will give you
[2:12:18] exception. It is an evil
[2:12:20] imagination of your evil
[2:12:23] heart. The Bible says they did not
[2:12:26] listen and they went
[2:12:28] backward and they did not go forward.
[2:12:31] Brother, I encourage you. Let us not go
[2:12:34] backward. Let us go
[2:12:37] forward. No matter what you do, let's go
[2:12:40] forward. We know what the word say. If
[2:12:44] we believe the word, we are going
[2:12:45] forward.
[2:12:49] He says, "But they hecken
[2:12:53] not. And since the day that your fathers
[2:12:56] came forth out of the land of
[2:12:59] Egypt, unto this day, I have even sent
[2:13:03] unto you all my servants, the
[2:13:06] prophets, daily rising
[2:13:10] up, and sending them
[2:13:19] I wake up early and send you prophets.
[2:13:21] Amen. Even today, forget about Isaiah,
[2:13:25] forget about Jeremiah. Forget about the
[2:13:27] other prophets. God has sent you the
[2:13:30] prophet. Let me say in our generation.
[2:13:34] But even now, God has sent me to
[2:13:39] you. If you
[2:13:41] hear a new testament
[2:13:44] preacher but said he's a
[2:13:51] prophet. So when he comes and preaches
[2:13:53] the word and you say maybe heard about
[2:13:56] you maybe because he knows
[2:13:59] this you have refused to hear the voice
[2:14:02] of
[2:14:04] God. And he says, "Yet God rose up
[2:14:08] early." Meaning Al when before you did
[2:14:12] the wrong
[2:14:14] thing before he caught you, before you
[2:14:18] did the wrong thing and he warned you,
[2:14:21] but you did not
[2:14:23] listen. God always comes to you early
[2:14:25] before you go
[2:14:29] wrong. I may be your brother. I may be
[2:14:32] your your your son. I may be a friend
[2:14:35] but when I'm giving you the word I am
[2:14:38] none of those I am God's voice to
[2:14:43] you and so is every God called
[2:14:49] preacher God raised up and he sent him
[2:14:51] to
[2:14:53] you and he says yet they hearken not
[2:14:55] unto
[2:14:56] me nor inclined their
[2:15:00] earned their neck
[2:15:07] They did worse than their
[2:15:09] fathers. Therefore, thou shalt speak all
[2:15:13] these words unto
[2:15:14] them, but they will not heck unto
[2:15:17] thee. Thou shalt also call unto them,
[2:15:21] but they will not answer
[2:15:23] thee. But thou shalt say unto them, this
[2:15:27] is a nation that obeyest not the voice
[2:15:30] of the Lord their God.
[2:15:33] receiveth
[2:15:34] correction, truth is perished and is cut
[2:15:38] off from their
[2:15:41] mouth. And now what did God
[2:15:44] do? Brother, sister, it is very
[2:15:49] important to listen to God when he
[2:15:51] speaks to
[2:15:54] you. Very very important. Never take the
[2:15:58] word of God for
[2:16:01] granted because God is coming to you
[2:16:05] early. He doesn't want you to be
[2:16:08] judged. But if you refuse, then he
[2:16:12] brings his
[2:16:13] judgment. His judgment is
[2:16:15] fierce. He said, "I will do something
[2:16:19] that even whoever
[2:16:21] hears their ears will tingle."
[2:16:25] Let me tell you, God is not threatening.
[2:16:28] God is not scaring. Whatever he says, he
[2:16:31] does
[2:16:33] it. So if you are here and you're not a
[2:16:36] hecken to the word of God concerning
[2:16:38] anything in your
[2:16:41] life,
[2:16:46] he correct your
[2:16:48] life. Put your life right. Walk
[2:16:51] according to the ways of God.
[2:16:55] do what you need to do. Accept
[2:17:00] correction. Hear the voice of the
[2:17:02] Lord. But he said, "Even when you speak
[2:17:05] to
[2:17:06] them, they will not hear." So what did
[2:17:10] he then do? In Jeremiah
[2:17:13] 27 5, the judgment of God
[2:17:17] begin. I want you to see. God can hire
[2:17:22] even an
[2:17:25] unbeliever to bring his judgment on
[2:17:29] you. You say me,
[2:17:32] I love the boy. Okay, you love that
[2:17:35] boy. God will hire that
[2:17:40] boy to bring serious judgment on him.
[2:17:46] And then you I wish I
[2:17:49] had time is no more you had but you not
[2:17:51] correct yourself.
[2:17:54] But right now you have a
[2:17:56] chance to correct
[2:17:58] yourself. Brother, you cannot keep a a
[2:18:02] girlfriend when you're not ready for
[2:18:05] marriage. Believers have a way a decorum
[2:18:08] they have about themselves.
[2:18:14] You see if you
[2:18:16] don't the judgment of God is
[2:18:19] coming and it comes
[2:18:22] quick and is
[2:18:24] fierce. Let us live right. Let us live
[2:18:28] lives that are worthy of the calling we
[2:18:31] have been
[2:18:33] called. The Bible said we are a royal
[2:18:38] priesthood. We are priests and kings.
[2:18:43] We are a chosen
[2:18:46] generation. We are not a
[2:18:48] commoner. I am a chosen
[2:18:51] generation. I want to live in my life
[2:18:54] and my
[2:18:55] path. I having a life that will give
[2:18:59] glory to
[2:19:01] God. When I hear the word and my life
[2:19:04] has not been going
[2:19:06] well, quickly I repent.
[2:19:09] The badness means changing your
[2:19:11] way, moving away from your
[2:19:14] sin and doing what you ought to
[2:19:17] do. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter what
[2:19:20] they know about you. God corrects your
[2:19:24] past. When you repent, God corrects your
[2:19:28] past. And when you have repented of
[2:19:32] something, forget about
[2:19:35] guilt because that's not even part of
[2:19:38] it.
[2:19:40] It is forgotten
[2:19:42] completely. Your past is divorced from
[2:19:49] you. I want you to see. Israel refuse to
[2:19:53] repent. And now let us see what God told
[2:19:56] them. Jeremiah
[2:19:58] 27:5. I have made the earth, the man and
[2:20:02] the beast that are upon the
[2:20:06] ground. Because I'm the one who made
[2:20:08] them. God is boasting. I have made this
[2:20:12] thing. By my great
[2:20:15] power have I made have I and by my
[2:20:19] outstretched
[2:20:21] arm and have given it unto whom it
[2:20:26] seemed unto me.
[2:20:32] I made this
[2:20:33] earth. I made every beast that is upon
[2:20:37] the ground by the great
[2:20:41] power and my outstretched
[2:20:43] arm. And then I've given it to
[2:20:47] whomsoever I saw
[2:20:52] [Music]
[2:20:53] fit. Don't joke with God. God is God.
[2:21:00] He knows he created this world.
[2:21:04] He can do anything with
[2:21:06] anyone. God has power over believers.
[2:21:11] But also God has power over
[2:21:15] nonbelievers because they are living in
[2:21:17] his
[2:21:19] eyes. He created them too.
[2:21:23] Did he
[2:21:24] say he created even
[2:21:28] Pharaoh for judgment?
[2:21:32] God is God. We cannot debate with
[2:21:37] him. And now after exercising his
[2:21:40] authority in his
[2:21:44] word, he now begins to say what he has
[2:21:47] done. He warned them. They refused to
[2:21:50] hear. Now he has first of all reminded
[2:21:53] them I am the creator of
[2:21:55] everything and I give it to whoever you
[2:21:58] want. Meaning including
[2:22:00] you including you are his creation he
[2:22:05] can give to you to whoever you
[2:22:11] want God let me fall in your arms.
[2:22:14] That's why David s there are some he
[2:22:18] said let me be in your house. He never
[2:22:19] wanted anyone to judge
[2:22:24] him. He can give you to whoever you
[2:22:28] want. Vers six. And now have I given all
[2:22:32] these
[2:22:35] lands, including
[2:22:38] Israel, into the hand of
[2:22:42] Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Are
[2:22:44] you hearing me, church, my
[2:22:49] servant, Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:22:53] the king of of
[2:22:55] Babylon, my
[2:22:57] servant, God has hired a servant
[2:23:02] an
[2:23:03] unbeliever to charge us the unrepentant
[2:23:10] believers. If you don't want to
[2:23:12] repent, you are in difficult
[2:23:15] position. Hallelujah. God has
[2:23:20] hired to give him everything was
[2:23:23] supposed to be
[2:23:25] yours because you refuse to repent.
[2:23:30] And the beast of the field have I given
[2:23:32] him also to serve
[2:23:36] him. And you are very busy chasing
[2:23:39] others. It is running away. Whatever you
[2:23:42] are chasing is running away
[2:23:44] from going to others even the
[2:23:47] unbelievers and then he begins saying I
[2:23:50] think God is not faithful. It is because
[2:23:53] of your life. Check it.
[2:23:57] How come the world has what is supposed
[2:23:59] to be
[2:24:03] yours? There is a problem with your walk
[2:24:05] with the
[2:24:06] Lord. But if you walk right with
[2:24:09] God, oh Nebuchadnezzar has no
[2:24:13] right. Nebuchadnezzar has no
[2:24:16] right. The priest of Babylon has no
[2:24:20] right to claim our God-given
[2:24:24] properties, to claim our God-given
[2:24:28] promises. As long as we are walking
[2:24:30] right with
[2:24:31] God, we can take every one of
[2:24:34] them one by one and we tell the prince
[2:24:38] of
[2:24:38] Babylon, this belongs to
[2:24:41] me. But if you do not walk
[2:24:44] right, you don't have that authority.
[2:24:49] Listen. And all nations shall serve
[2:24:53] him and his son and his son and his son
[2:24:58] until the very time of his land
[2:25:03] come. And then many nations and great
[2:25:05] kings shall serve themselves of
[2:25:11] him. And it shall come to pass that a
[2:25:14] nation and a kingdom
[2:25:17] which will not serve the same
[2:25:19] Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:25:23] the king of
[2:25:25] Babylon, and that will not put their
[2:25:29] neck under the yoke of the king of
[2:25:34] Babylon, that nation I will
[2:25:41] punish. God is saying, "All they that do
[2:25:45] not put
[2:25:47] themselves under the prince of
[2:25:52] Babylon, God will
[2:25:54] punish."
[2:25:57] How with the
[2:25:59] sword and with famine and with
[2:26:02] pestilence until I have consumed them by
[2:26:05] his hand? is Nebuchadnezzar's
[2:26:15] hand. God is servant
[2:26:19] Nebuchadnezzar was
[2:26:23] hired.
[2:26:24] God do not let me ever fall.
[2:26:32] Save me from that
[2:26:34] shame. Let me be repentant,
[2:26:37] Lord. Let me hear your word when you
[2:26:40] speak. Let me hear your voice when you
[2:26:43] say that. I will be
[2:26:46] saved from
[2:26:50] shame. But you see, when you hire a
[2:26:55] servant, you deploy
[2:26:58] him. God has now hired him.
[2:27:01] What is remaining is
[2:27:05] deployment he has given him all the
[2:27:07] world. Now it is in the hand
[2:27:10] of thus sayith the
[2:27:14] Lord. Now let us see the
[2:27:17] deployment. Jeremiah
[2:27:19] 25 6 and go not after other gods to
[2:27:23] serve
[2:27:26] them and to worship them and provoke me
[2:27:30] not to anger with the works of your
[2:27:32] hands is speaking God is speaking to
[2:27:35] [Music]
[2:27:37] Israel if you don't do that I will do
[2:27:41] you no
[2:27:47] He will not hurt us. If you don't serve
[2:27:49] other
[2:27:50] gods and you don't worship them and if
[2:27:53] you don't provoke the anger of God with
[2:27:54] your
[2:27:57] works, he will do you no
[2:28:00] heart. Hallelujah. Shout I you will do
[2:28:02] me no
[2:28:05] heart.
[2:28:06] Yet ye have not hearkened unto me,
[2:28:11] saith the Lord, that he might provoke me
[2:28:14] to
[2:28:15] anger with the works of your
[2:28:18] hands to your own
[2:28:21] heart, to your own
[2:28:28] heart.
[2:28:29] Therefore, therefore, God is saying, I
[2:28:33] cannot hurt you. It's not me hurting you
[2:28:37] but what you have
[2:28:39] done is making yourself hurt yourself.
[2:28:45] When I took
[2:28:47] any put him in my
[2:28:49] legs, brought a rod, he said, "Daddy,
[2:28:52] forgive me. Don't beat me." I said, "I
[2:28:55] can't beat you. I love you, my son. But
[2:28:59] what you have done, you have to suffer
[2:29:01] the
[2:29:03] pain." Why? Because I want you to come
[2:29:05] out right. In the same way, if you don't
[2:29:09] listen to God, he'll put you in his
[2:29:12] legs. He's putting his in his legs.
[2:29:15] And he's saying, "I'm not hurting you.
[2:29:17] You are hurting yourself."
[2:29:23] And then he says,
[2:29:26] "Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord of
[2:29:29] hosts, because ye have not heard my
[2:29:32] words, behold, I will send and take all
[2:29:36] the families of the north, sayeth the
[2:29:41] Lord, and
[2:29:44] Nebuchadnezzar, the king of
[2:29:47] Babylon, my servant,
[2:29:54] You should leave your
[2:30:00] God. You can wonder how God can forsake
[2:30:05] according to his servant and calls the
[2:30:07] nonbeliever their servant.
[2:30:10] You know how it
[2:30:16] feels. He's supposed to call you my
[2:30:18] servant.
[2:30:19] But he's calling your enemy, his
[2:30:23] servants. And he repeatedly said
[2:30:25] it to provoke
[2:30:28] them to know how small they are.
[2:30:32] He will share his glory with no one.
[2:30:42] He says, "I will set send the families
[2:30:44] of the north, say the Lord, and
[2:30:46] Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my
[2:30:48] servant, and will bring them against
[2:30:50] this
[2:30:58] land, and against the inhabitants
[2:31:02] thereof, and against all these
[2:31:05] nations round about. And I will utterly
[2:31:08] destroy
[2:31:10] them and make them an
[2:31:15] astonishment and
[2:31:19] unhissing and perpetual
[2:31:24] destation. Moreover, I will take from
[2:31:28] them the voice of
[2:31:30] math and the voice of
[2:31:33] gladness, the voice of the
[2:31:36] bridegroom, the voice of the
[2:31:38] bride, the sound of the
[2:31:41] millstones, and the light of the candle.
[2:31:44] I will take it from
[2:31:46] them. And this whole
[2:31:49] land shall be a
[2:31:54] desolation and an an
[2:31:58] astonishment. And this nation shall
[2:32:00] serve the king of Babylon 70
[2:32:06] years. Can you say
[2:32:08] amen? Here is
[2:32:10] Israel finally struck by God's judgment.
[2:32:15] Jeremiah the weeping
[2:32:17] prophet stays in in this devastated
[2:32:27] place. It comes to show that God is
[2:32:29] always weeping over every sinner that
[2:32:32] has lost his
[2:32:38] way. Jeremiah writes the book of
[2:32:41] lamentations.
[2:32:44] When he is left in
[2:32:46] Israel, when Israel is
[2:32:50] there in
[2:32:53] ruins, he was there with a few poor
[2:32:58] guys. All that buildings
[2:33:01] destroyed. He had become a
[2:33:04] dissolation, a an astonishment.
[2:33:08] The whole land was
[2:33:10] absurd. The
[2:33:12] temple was
[2:33:18] destroyed. God had fought for them
[2:33:20] battles. Since God took them from Egypt.
[2:33:24] God had proved that he was God. God had
[2:33:27] never failed them. God fought their
[2:33:29] enemies. One time God broke the walls of
[2:33:33] Jericho.
[2:33:35] One time God made a way in the sea. One
[2:33:38] time God parted Jonah. One time God did
[2:33:42] many
[2:33:44] miracles. But now because of
[2:33:47] unbelief, he said, you will see what I'm
[2:33:50] able to do. Everything I built over
[2:33:53] these
[2:33:54] years in your life, I will
[2:33:57] destroy. Let me tell you, brother. Do
[2:34:00] not ever play with God.
[2:34:03] God is able to reduce you to
[2:34:07] nothing if you don't humble
[2:34:10] yourself. He took a
[2:34:13] king. He took a king who was a great
[2:34:16] man. And he said there is no God. God
[2:34:19] said what? I am the one who made you
[2:34:22] God. All right. Let us see. Until you
[2:34:26] say there is God in heaven, I'm going to
[2:34:30] reduce you to nothing.
[2:34:32] This man started eating
[2:34:34] grass, like an animal. He grew
[2:34:37] feathers like a horse. Don't play with
[2:34:42] God. God can reduce it to
[2:34:45] nothing. What you think is beauty, it
[2:34:48] can fade. What you think is strength, it
[2:34:52] can disappear. What you think is
[2:34:54] something you have achieved in your
[2:34:56] life, God can show it is nothing.
[2:34:58] Listen, humble
[2:35:00] yourself before God,
[2:35:05] obey his voice and you will
[2:35:09] prosper. Amen.
[2:35:12] And then he reduced
[2:35:15] Israel to
[2:35:18] nothing and he started
[2:35:20] weeping. Jeremiah was in Israel
[2:35:24] well the whole book of
[2:35:26] lamentation is
[2:35:29] lamenting because of the people it's not
[2:35:32] Jeremiah the same man who spoke these
[2:35:34] words it was God in Jeremiah now it is
[2:35:38] God in
[2:35:40] Jeremiah the book of
[2:35:42] lamentation
[2:35:44] lamenting for what has happened in the
[2:35:47] land of Israel
[2:35:51] And you see the Holy Spirit always
[2:35:54] weeps over every
[2:35:58] sinner. He always weeps. You see in the
[2:36:01] message return and
[2:36:04] Jubilee Bam shouts out and say
[2:36:08] return. The Holy Spirit cries return. I
[2:36:13] can think of when Jesus looked over
[2:36:16] Jerusalem and he wept, he loved it and
[2:36:21] they had rejected him. And a man that's
[2:36:24] filled with the spirit
[2:36:26] tonight can look over the church and see
[2:36:30] people that ought to be
[2:36:32] shining with the glorious power of
[2:36:36] God and the Holy Spirit within your
[2:36:40] heart will
[2:36:42] weep tears of
[2:36:45] regret. What have we done? When you see
[2:36:49] young people living anyhow they want to
[2:36:52] walk. They don't care about the word.
[2:36:55] They don't care about the promises of
[2:36:57] God. They don't care about thirsting and
[2:37:00] hungering for God. The Holy Spirit in
[2:37:02] you. Whether you're a mother or a father
[2:37:05] or a young person, old person, a
[2:37:08] minister, you can't live normally. You
[2:37:11] will weep in your
[2:37:14] heart. What have we done?
[2:37:17] God calls us. God called us our fathers,
[2:37:21] our out 50 years
[2:37:23] ago and we returned back. And you see
[2:37:27] what it got
[2:37:28] us a disgraceful
[2:37:32] bunch. And it has got us a disgraceful
[2:37:35] bunch under the name Pentecost.
[2:37:38] [Music]
[2:37:42] People who
[2:37:43] smoke, they're Pentecostals.
[2:37:46] Christians these days not even
[2:37:49] Pentecostals. They call themselves
[2:37:51] message
[2:37:52] believers. They can quote the message
[2:37:54] like a moving
[2:37:57] dictionary. They know the Bible in and
[2:38:00] out. But their
[2:38:02] life is it is far from what
[2:38:06] they let me tell you brother. Don't give
[2:38:09] me a good quotation
[2:38:12] machine. Give me a lived life.
[2:38:17] You may not know the whole Bible in your
[2:38:19] head. You may not have read the whole
[2:38:21] message, but give me a life that is shut
[2:38:25] up by this
[2:38:27] word. A man, a woman that is living the
[2:38:30] life of Jesus
[2:38:34] Christ. He said he will take the
[2:38:37] fools and confound the wisdom of the
[2:38:39] wise.
[2:38:43] You
[2:38:44] see a disgraceful bunch. People who
[2:38:48] smoke,
[2:38:49] people who
[2:38:51] drink and you call yourself a
[2:38:54] believer, you smoke and
[2:38:57] drink, married three or four
[2:39:01] times. Women who cut their
[2:39:04] hair in the name of design and
[2:39:08] fashion. Believers don't cut their hair.
[2:39:11] If you're a woman, why? Hair is your
[2:39:17] glory. If you reduce it by one bit, it
[2:39:20] is cutting
[2:39:22] it. Keep your natural
[2:39:25] hair. Natural
[2:39:31] sisters, whether you say amen or not, I
[2:39:34] am convinced it is the word of
[2:39:38] God. Women who cut their hair
[2:39:42] They paint and use their shorts and wear
[2:39:45] immoral
[2:39:47] clothes everything and they call
[2:39:50] themselves Pentecostal
[2:39:52] sisters and they call themselves
[2:39:54] believers of the
[2:39:56] message the other
[2:39:58] side when they walk it is painting their
[2:40:04] side when they sit. Oh my God and you
[2:40:09] call yourself a believer.
[2:40:10] It doesn't matter which office you are
[2:40:12] working
[2:40:13] in. Sister, you have to be a
[2:40:17] believer. Show the life of
[2:40:20] Jesus. It doesn't mean you are going to
[2:40:23] dress something which is
[2:40:26] sweeping. I mean dress
[2:40:33] decently. What a disgrace on the name of
[2:40:36] Christ. What a disgrace upon his church.
[2:40:41] No wonder he says blasphemous names was
[2:40:43] found in
[2:40:48] Babylon
[2:40:50] organization confusion all messed up all
[2:40:53] kind of this and the other where is
[2:40:56] Christ in the whole
[2:40:59] spirit. And then he says return
[2:41:02] people. May God help us to
[2:41:05] return to the faith of our
[2:41:08] fathers, to return to a prayerful
[2:41:11] life, to return to a hungering and
[2:41:13] thirsting. You young seeking after
[2:41:17] God, not after boys and
[2:41:19] money. You young men not seeking after
[2:41:22] lustful things and
[2:41:24] desires. You're on your phone. You're
[2:41:26] seeking the newest iPad, the newest
[2:41:28] iPhone, the newest car.
[2:41:31] You don't even have money to buy
[2:41:34] it. Relax. Get back to seeking after the
[2:41:38] real
[2:41:40] things. We should return to the real
[2:41:43] true Pentecostal
[2:41:48] message where families can come at the
[2:41:52] altar and
[2:41:54] pray and desire
[2:41:57] God. Yes, you don't have him. So, desire
[2:41:59] him.
[2:42:02] But that thirst is
[2:42:03] gone. Everybody's just jumping up and
[2:42:06] going. Young people don't even have a
[2:42:08] place to
[2:42:09] stay. They can't even step put in one
[2:42:13] church. They're running up your looking
[2:42:16] for wives and
[2:42:17] husbands. Shame on our
[2:42:19] generation. We have to
[2:42:21] step. We have to relax and know that God
[2:42:25] is faithful.
[2:42:29] He has not disappointed
[2:42:31] anyone who trusted in him. Lamentations
[2:42:34] chapter 3 vers 19. Let us talk about his
[2:42:39] faithfulness. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:42:42] Remembering mine
[2:42:43] affliction and my
[2:42:45] misery. the woman and the
[2:42:48] girl. My
[2:42:50] soul has them still in remembrance and
[2:42:53] is humbled in
[2:42:56] me. This I recall to my
[2:42:59] mind. Therefore, I have
[2:43:02] hope. It is of the Lord his
[2:43:05] mercies. We are not
[2:43:07] consumed. Because his
[2:43:10] compassion, they are new every morning.
[2:43:13] Great is thy faithfulness. The Lord is
[2:43:15] my passion, saith my soul. Therefore
[2:43:19] will I hope in him. The Lord is good
[2:43:21] unto them that wait for him. To the soul
[2:43:26] that seeketh him. It is good that a man
[2:43:28] should both hope and quietly wait for
[2:43:30] the salvation of the
[2:43:35] Lord. Let's look at this and then we
[2:43:37] finish. So verse 21 says, "Then I recall
[2:43:40] to my
[2:43:41] mind, therefore have I hope.
[2:43:44] I said, "I have hope." Tell yourself, "I
[2:43:47] have
[2:43:48] hope. I have hope." First Thessalonians
[2:43:52] 4:30, "But I will not have you to be
[2:43:56] ignorant concerning them that are
[2:43:58] asleep, that ye sorrow
[2:44:00] not. Do not
[2:44:02] sorrow. Don't leave as someone who has
[2:44:06] sorrow, even as others which have no
[2:44:08] hope."
[2:44:09] Psalms
[2:44:11] 39 vers 7. And now, Lord, what wait I
[2:44:17] for? My hope is in thee. Deliver me from
[2:44:21] all my
[2:44:23] transgressions. Let me not the reproach
[2:44:26] of the
[2:44:28] foolish. I was
[2:44:30] dumb. I open not my mouth because thou
[2:44:34] did
[2:44:35] this. My hope is in thee.
[2:44:41] Amen. My hope is in this. No matter what
[2:44:46] you're going
[2:44:47] through, Amen. You might have fallen
[2:44:49] away like how Israel had fell away. You
[2:44:52] must be able to say, "Lord, the hope is
[2:44:56] in
[2:44:57] you." Listen, God can save and
[2:45:03] redeem. Even if you think your family is
[2:45:07] sinking, you think there is no hope
[2:45:10] anywhere. God save us not with money. He
[2:45:14] doesn't save with money. He doesn't save
[2:45:16] with good. He doesn't save with people.
[2:45:20] Have hope in
[2:45:22] God because he's
[2:45:26] faithful. You know this man Jeremiah, he
[2:45:31] shouts it out.
[2:45:33] He said, "But I have
[2:45:35] hope. This one may be
[2:45:38] forsaken. Everything may be destroyed,
[2:45:41] but I have hope." A believer never gives
[2:45:46] up. Amen. A believer never gives up. A
[2:45:51] believer
[2:45:52] believes even until
[2:45:54] death. A believer
[2:45:57] believes. Even when you feel you can't
[2:46:00] overcome, I believe I always has
[2:46:03] hope. I will make it. I can make it. I
[2:46:07] can
[2:46:08] overcome. I will not be forsaken. I have
[2:46:13] hope. Hallelujah. And David cried out.
[2:46:17] He said, "My hope is in
[2:46:20] thee." Praise the name of the Lord. For
[2:46:23] the Lord will not cast off forever.
[2:46:26] Though he caused
[2:46:29] grief, yet will he have
[2:46:33] compassion. Amen. According to the
[2:46:36] multitude of his
[2:46:38] mercies, for he does not afflict
[2:46:43] willingly, nor grieve the children of
[2:46:47] men. He will not cast off forever.
[2:46:54] sayeth the word of God
[2:46:57] today, he will not cast off
[2:47:00] forever. Maybe God has cast you
[2:47:03] off because of your
[2:47:05] lifestyle. Maybe he has judged you. But
[2:47:09] I want to tell you, God was not going to
[2:47:11] forsake Israel
[2:47:13] forever. There was
[2:47:16] hope. Hope for their restoration.
[2:47:20] He said after 70
[2:47:23] years after 70 years. That's why when
[2:47:26] Daniel was reading and he read this part
[2:47:30] where Jeremiah said after 70 years and
[2:47:34] Jeremiah and Daniel he took up and began
[2:47:39] calculating from the time they went in.
[2:47:42] What time were they living? He saw it
[2:47:45] was just a few years for them to come
[2:47:48] out. And Daniel under the anointing, he
[2:47:52] began praying. He began praying and
[2:47:56] repenting and confessing because Daniel
[2:48:00] saw there was a
[2:48:03] hope.
[2:48:05] Amen. Your situation may be too
[2:48:08] bad. Your family may be too bad. Your
[2:48:11] condition may be too
[2:48:13] rough. But I'm speaking to you. I'm
[2:48:16] speaking to you.
[2:48:18] speaking to you. There is hope.
[2:48:22] Amen.
[2:48:25] Hallelujah.
[2:48:31] Vers 22 says, "It is of the Lord's
[2:48:35] mercies that we are not consumed because
[2:48:38] he's because he is because his
[2:48:41] compassion fail
[2:48:45] not. His
[2:48:48] compassion, his
[2:48:51] compassion, his compassion fail not.
[2:48:57] The devil has
[2:48:59] desired to destroy
[2:49:02] you. The devil's desire to
[2:49:12] destroy,
[2:49:14] but it is of the Lord's
[2:49:17] mercies that you are not
[2:49:21] consumed. The devil has planned
[2:49:25] to bury you in many
[2:49:29] toms of immoral
[2:49:32] living of
[2:49:33] anxiety of depression of
[2:49:37] pressure of self
[2:49:39] righteousness of
[2:49:43] fear. You see the pleasures
[2:49:46] of the lust of the eyes but it is the
[2:49:50] Lord's
[2:49:51] mercy. We are not consumed.
[2:49:55] meaning his mercies endure
[2:49:59] forever. As long as you are the elect of
[2:50:03] God. Amen.
[2:50:06] He is holding me. I am not the one
[2:50:09] holding him. He is holding me. I may not
[2:50:13] have the faithfulness all the
[2:50:15] time. But he is always
[2:50:20] faithful. Hallelujah.
[2:50:23] Hallelujah.
[2:50:25] They are new every morning.
[2:50:28] Great is thy
[2:50:31] faithfulness in the last church
[2:50:34] age. He says this great
[2:50:37] creator, listen savior God. He's
[2:50:40] faithfully working amongst his own right
[2:50:43] now. Now, now, now as the great shepherd
[2:50:47] of the
[2:50:47] sheep, his very existence is for his
[2:50:50] own.
[2:50:53] He loves them and he cares for them. He
[2:50:58] loves them. He loves you and cares for
[2:51:01] you. His eye is ever upon
[2:51:07] them. When the word
[2:51:09] says that your lives are hid with Christ
[2:51:14] himself, it means exactly what it says.
[2:51:18] The devil can't have your
[2:51:20] life. The devil can't have my life. He
[2:51:23] can't have your life. Why? He can't see
[2:51:27] my life. My life is
[2:51:29] hid in Christ. In Christ I live. My life
[2:51:34] is hid away in Christ. And when the
[2:51:37] devil tries to enter
[2:51:38] there, he is denied
[2:51:41] access. My life is hid. The life I now
[2:51:45] live. It is Christ that liveth for me.
[2:51:51] [Applause]
[2:51:52] Hallelujah.
[2:51:54] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:51:56] Amen. Oh, I'm so glad that my God abides
[2:52:01] faith. He is true to
[2:52:03] himself. He will not
[2:52:06] lie. He is true to the word. He will
[2:52:09] back it up. He is true to us. He will
[2:52:13] lose none of us.
[2:52:15] raise up in the last days. I am glad
[2:52:19] that I am resting in his
[2:52:21] faithfulness. Philippians
[2:52:24] 1:6 being
[2:52:26] confident of this very thing that he
[2:52:29] which began a good
[2:52:31] work. In you, everybody say in me. In
[2:52:36] me, he began a good
[2:52:39] work. He will perform
[2:52:42] it until the day
[2:52:45] Jesus Christ.
[2:52:48] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:52:51] I say hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:52:54] Lamentation
[2:52:56] 35. And I want to try and finish now.
[2:52:59] The Lord is good unto them that will
[2:53:02] wait for him that seeketh him. It is
[2:53:06] good that a man should both
[2:53:08] hope and quietly wait for the salvation
[2:53:12] of the Lord.
[2:53:17] [Music]
[2:53:19] It is good for a man that he bear the
[2:53:22] yoke in his
[2:53:25] youth. And in a message why brother Bham
[2:53:28] says, "Oh God, I
[2:53:30] believe. I will never turn
[2:53:33] loose. I will stay right here till
[2:53:36] something happens to
[2:53:39] me." Remember friends, this may be the
[2:53:42] last time
[2:53:44] that the prayer will ever be
[2:53:46] prayed. The death angel may summon you
[2:53:49] before the
[2:53:51] dead. Now is the time to get down to
[2:53:53] business with
[2:53:55] God. Now is the time to believe
[2:53:57] it. Confess your sins. Go right back
[2:54:01] where you left
[2:54:02] him. Go right back where you left him.
[2:54:06] And there you will find him
[2:54:07] again. What caused you to lose your joy?
[2:54:12] Find out where you lost it. Go right
[2:54:15] back
[2:54:16] there. And say,
[2:54:18] "Lord, I'm
[2:54:20] sorry. I'm starting right
[2:54:23] here. Find out where you left him. Where
[2:54:26] did you lose your joy at wherever you
[2:54:29] lost your joy? Wherever you stopped
[2:54:31] serving him, go right back to that spot
[2:54:37] again. Start right there.
[2:54:40] Right where you left
[2:54:42] off, there is where you find him. He
[2:54:46] will be
[2:54:47] waiting. Hallelujah. You'll be standing
[2:54:52] there waiting to receive you.
[2:55:00] Let us stand on our feet.
[2:55:11] And Jesus
[2:55:14] was with Mary and Joseph
[2:55:18] and they left him in the
[2:55:20] temple and they went ways
[2:55:24] away.
[2:55:26] But they
[2:55:28] realized Jesus was not with
[2:55:31] them. They didn't say we should
[2:55:33] continue. He will follow us.
[2:55:35] [Music]
[2:55:36] They didn't say he knows our
[2:55:38] home. He said let's go
[2:55:40] back and find
[2:55:44] him with every head bowed, every eye
[2:55:49] closed. I want to ask
[2:55:52] you, where did you lose
[2:55:56] him? You've not always been
[2:56:01] backsliden. You backslider.
[2:56:05] If you're backslider here
[2:56:08] today like Israel, you've not heard the
[2:56:11] voice of
[2:56:12] God. You kept on turning it down,
[2:56:15] turning it
[2:56:18] down. Remember, you've not always been
[2:56:21] that
[2:56:23] way. Remember when it all first
[2:56:28] started? Let's go back to the beginning.
[2:56:33] I want you to meditate about that.
[2:56:40] Jesus is right
[2:56:43] there. He's
[2:56:46] waiting at that very spot where you left
[2:56:51] him. He's
[2:56:53] faithful. When you come back, he cannot
[2:56:56] deny you. He cannot reject you. He will
[2:57:00] receive you.
[2:57:02] He is faithful.
[2:57:04] The prodigal son left
[2:57:07] and he went with all his goods and money
[2:57:09] and
[2:57:10] everything. But after he suffered and he
[2:57:13] came to
[2:57:14] himself, he said, "Let me go
[2:57:17] back." His father did not go looking for
[2:57:20] him. No, the boy came to himself. He
[2:57:25] said, "Let me go back
[2:57:26] home. Let me go back
[2:57:28] home. Let me go back home.
[2:57:32] My father will receive it. Even if as a
[2:57:35] as a
[2:57:37] servant, I'm ready for
[2:57:39] it. And his father could never receive
[2:57:42] him as a
[2:57:44] son. He's a son. Always a son. Will
[2:57:49] always be a
[2:57:51] son. Listen to me. You are a son of God.
[2:57:56] You are a daughter of God.
[2:57:58] You'll always be what you have been in
[2:58:01] his
[2:58:02] mind. But you are lost. You've fallen
[2:58:05] away. You don't need to receive the
[2:58:08] anger of
[2:58:10] God. You don't need to receive the anger
[2:58:13] of
[2:58:16] God. He's still
[2:58:19] merciful. He will abundantly
[2:58:22] pardon. He's faithful.
[2:58:26] He will wash away your
[2:58:29] sins and make your life
[2:58:31] right. He will clean you up, straighten
[2:58:35] you up. What do you need to do? Repent.
[2:58:39] Let go of your
[2:58:41] sins. Let go of that sin which has
[2:58:44] easily beset
[2:58:46] you. Pass it away. Drop it. Dump it.
[2:58:49] Refuse it. Walk away from it.
[2:58:53] Say, "Lord Jesus, I am now
[2:58:56] returning. Receive me now. I'm coming
[2:59:01] now." Listen,
[2:59:04] friends, it's not always that we have
[2:59:06] services like
[2:59:09] these. I feel so thrilled in my
[2:59:13] soul that the Holy Spirit is after
[2:59:16] somebody
[2:59:19] today. It could be you.
[2:59:22] It could be you. If God has been
[2:59:24] speaking to
[2:59:25] you, everybody please please bow your
[2:59:29] head and close your
[2:59:31] eyes. If you are that person or I tell
[2:59:34] you something is about to
[2:59:36] come, slowly walk to
[2:59:43] the slowly walk to the
[2:59:45] altar. Say, "Lord
[2:59:47] Jesus, I'm coming back to you.
[2:59:51] You will receive me Lord.
[2:59:56] Like Israel, he did not cast away
[2:59:59] forever. He received them.
[3:00:03] He forgave
[3:00:05] them. And then they started a new
[3:00:07] journey. Seven years were
[3:00:10] finished. And another journey
[3:00:13] started. And
[3:00:15] friends, he has Israel to deal with us
[3:00:19] today.
[3:00:22] He has come for you. He's interested in
[3:00:26] you. Everybody's eyes please
[3:00:29] close. Be in prayer.
[3:00:31] Everybody, the spirit of God is
[3:00:34] here. Many people here are going to be
[3:00:37] delivered out of the chains of sin. And
[3:00:41] of Satan has no power over your life
[3:00:45] because he has been exposed.
[3:00:49] The Holy Spirit will come and electrify
[3:00:51] your soul and your body and your
[3:00:53] [Music]
[3:00:54] spirit. He will give you strength and
[3:00:57] put strength in your
[3:01:00] soul. He's the
[3:01:04] redeemer. Everybody be in prayer now.
[3:01:08] Wherever you are, whether you at the
[3:01:10] altar or your seat
[3:01:16] today, he's
[3:01:18] faithful. You may have thought he has
[3:01:20] forsaken
[3:01:22] you, but I want to tell you, he is
[3:01:25] faithful. You may have thought your back
[3:01:28] is against the
[3:01:31] wall. He is faithful. You may think
[3:01:33] there is no hope for you.
[3:01:36] He there is hope. And God is faithful to
[3:01:40] keep that which he
[3:01:42] promised to finish that which he
[3:01:45] started. He is faithful. Get ready. Get
[3:01:49] ready right now to receive him in your
[3:01:52] soul. Get ready right now. Those demons,
[3:01:56] those powers of
[3:01:57] darkness, to live your life, to live
[3:02:00] your life. I don't care what powers of
[3:02:03] darkness it is.
[3:02:05] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Everybody be
[3:02:08] in prayer right now.
[3:02:10] Oh yes. Wow. Oh yes. Wow.
[3:02:14] I don't care what it is.
[3:02:17] Demons that have come to Amen. disturb
[3:02:19] your
[3:02:20] spirit. You've tried to break free from
[3:02:25] them. You've tried to break free from
[3:02:28] them. But you have
[3:02:30] failed. But there is a power.
[3:02:33] There is a power here right now. The
[3:02:36] power that loses the
[3:02:38] s. The power that sets you
[3:02:41] free. Free from
[3:02:44] alcohol.
[3:02:45] Free from all the demons of
[3:02:49] lust. Free from the
[3:02:52] spirit coming to you in many forms.
[3:02:55] Might be sicknesses. might be aiding
[3:02:59] spirits, tormenting you, oppressing you
[3:03:04] right now. If you are under the sound of
[3:03:06] my voice, I speak freedom into your
[3:03:08] life. I speak freedom into your life. I
[3:03:12] release you from every power of
[3:03:14] sin, every power of
[3:03:17] darkness. Amen. Because the blood is

[3:03:44] set

[3:04:03] there is hope.

[3:04:16] sins. Cleanse your life before
[3:04:19] God. He's here for you. He's here to
[3:04:23] embrace you. He's here to accept you.
[3:04:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's here to
[3:04:31] accept you.
[3:04:33] Everybody be in prayer
[3:04:35] now. Agonize in his
[3:04:39] presence. Don't be ashamed of him. Don't
[3:04:42] be ashamed of
[3:04:44] him. If it takes you to in his
[3:04:48] presence to cry
[3:04:50] out, do
[3:04:52] it. If it takes you to seek after him,
[3:04:56] say, "Lord, I am
[3:04:58] lost, but here I am,
[3:05:01] Lord." Do
[3:05:03] it. Ask him to come
[3:05:06] in and fill you with the
[3:05:09] joy of your salvation that you
[3:05:20] love. Ready?
