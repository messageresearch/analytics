Nairobi Nairobi but before I introduce you allow me to take a moment and put you up to date with the with I know I've taken a while so I need to put you to up to date with our contributions towards our church lunch because [Music] before I do that I'd like to remind uh some people who give Pleasures towards the patches of the piano and also the uh the rent but we are moving into this place yeah um uh you have quite a few here I know I'm seeing that you've there are some who have been consistently contributing but if you know that you pledge I would like to encourage you to please fulfill your place you know whenever you whenever you play unto the Lord the Bible says if you do not fulfill Bible you are a fool that's not my word this is God it's the Bible that if we don't fulfill why does the bible call us full righteous like as if you don't believe that God is there because the Bible says only a fool says that there is so if you pledge fulfill your place because God takes that it's not a pleasure to me or to the church it's a place that you've made for the work unto the Lord and so whenever you make a pledge kindly Brethren I want to encourage you don't take it lately myself and one of the the people that has continually played for our church land and I try to be an example to fulfill every other month is several here who also do that so we are still at um I don't

it's not the same assistant Antonio we are looking for at least 150 Millions let me ask you a question how many still believe that the Lord can do it is act like it foreign and the Lord will bless you amen so I'd like to introduce uh brother Kennedy Kennedy I have an email here that I'll just I'll just going back into the archives from 2014. in in November on Wednesday and I had visited I just visited Nairobi Nairobi as a preacher and uh I must meet very many Brethren my name is when you travel you get to meet many people how many more times but as I was walking out of the church after the service then I met this young brother Nancy who was seriously you know looking on his face and you know he stopped me and said God bless you brothers and uh I was young but he was much younger than me I was one year married at that time and uh so the brother told me I said I would like you to pray for me because I have a desire in my heart and so I I I I don't remember whether we prayed there but I remember I prayed with him and we kept you know I gave you my address I was reading this email it says God bless you how are you Brothers Kenny from Bad Exodus Pentecostal assemblies you gave me your contacts after the service was over and you told me to get in touch with you I had also told you about the button I have in my heart to serve God and so from that time we continually go were in touch with but again and brother Ken has been to Uganda a few times he has preached some phenomenon meetings he got married yeah what's up and there's a family man now massage and uh one thing that I I love about him is that something that I see in myself or I saw it myself even at that time that I saw in him 2018 the burden and the Brazil to serve god um you see there are many many people especially young people whatever the devil listen and the devil would like to take especially at a younger age and use them as His ambassadors for checking bank foreign [Music] and uh and with a trip of weeks in that trip God did marvelous things in the city of awasa which is still running even now foreign and you know when you have a different positive for coffee they don't you don't go on any flights and we are grounded and we are isolated so we were all discouraged and both of us were encouraging one another that was quite a moment but the Lord took us through it some good moments but most important is here to preach to us he has preached to us on Wednesday to turn assemblies pasted by Pastor weekly foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] is keeping well he's keeping me alive he's all over me but man is keeping me alive oh Jesus is keeping me alive where is the Holy Ghost on Fire amen [Music] [Music] Jesus is keeping me alive amen is a Holy Ghost on Fire is keeping me Hallelujah [Music] I feel him in my heart I have him in my heart is the Holy Ghost on Fire amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] is keeping Hallelujah you love the Lord this morning is he keeping you alive doing the work of redemption so we have every reason to thank him tonight we have every reason to praise him this is you know there's a reason why let me say that let everything that has breath praise the Lord is the one that gives the breath someone said some time go to the mortuary and put an alarm clock next to the dead body so if he's keeping you alive you have a reason to pray foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] foreign foreign foreign we want to ensure that we give that uh the full attention that it requires chapter 23. foreign [Music] I sent an angel before thee to keep me in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared the work of keeping the people in the way it was not the work of Moses the work of the Angels the work of bringing the people to the place because it is that our God is a jealous he could not leave the work of Salvation to any man foreign foreign beware of him and obey his voice obey his voice [Music] foreign foreign you're never Mina blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus we've been speaking about two times and I'm praying that the Lord tonight this this morning I'll just give us a climber for this at 24 years you know we can never really put a full stop to the word of God but I believe other ministers will come in and maybe take the same same line or take another Direction but since the messages the gospel is one engineering the thing is I will not preach like your pastor I may not preach like the ministers that you have here but I believe in the five-fold ministers every finger has a purpose [Music] we shall see how all these things match together but tonight I want to show you this day I want to show you something that we are moving that I'm preaching to members of a church foreign knew him to be a prophet was because it lined up with the scripture each and everything has to line up with the scriptures don't forget we will read the full benefits we would live at a privilege we won't just be listening to our gospel that no come to the house you will be blessed come to the house because you came to the house of the Lord now we finished and we are speaking about this man Moses through Ephesians that is not the end of your Christian Life relation chapter 4. it was in the spirit and he could hear the voice of the lord we can listen to the message [Applause] foreign [Applause] I've received the hidden light no from now I no longer that guy sleeps blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus is not coming with this message Ephesians chapter four depending on his message their voice is America blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus because when Moses left the scene blessed with the name of the Lord it was not the work of Moses that is your sense that God may help us because it comes to a place where foreign Muhammad because the promise of the day they were to go back that is why we have to measure each and everything with the words how how you know some things that are preached me so much as long as it does not match up with the words and the Lord was always with them remember we also said our hearts were so hard by the grace of the Lord was sufficient we know too many that the Old Testament was low but right there these people who are somehow experiencing the grace of God yet why were they experiencing the grace because God had chosen them as long as they were with Moses of course God will punish them right now if you go about in your wayward ways and you know the truth that is the same same thing that happened with them to fail Ure not stand to the problems comparing the experiences forgive me I feel like to mention something we should Ensure that we really check ourselves with the word problems we cannot say that we are Christians we want to pattern ourselves after the world because God that brought up the children of Israel and the purpose for them was that they should be a peculiarism God was dealing with these people so nicely Moses was giving them a challenge is there a nation that God is so near to them as the way is near to you this is how God was dealing with the children of Israel says of God was yes the age of the Lord spoke to Moses when they go to our place I've got instructions to the people together one shall not live by bread alone and Moses gave instructions foreign foreign came to a place do not take more okay on particular days because on the next day but I know they did not believe some of them and for sure very simple things very simple Charlie but yeah it was the voice of the age another time he tells them about this day for today and for tomorrow because tomorrow will be nothing that will fall now for today when they go up the next day because some of these people thought what this man is talking about we are so used to Moses whatsoever you will come across children do not fear because [Applause] I don't know how it happens foreign hallelujah amen because the children of Israelites for sure there is no sickness there's not me now they knew sickness and what was under my face that is why Moses monster maybe I can just repeat those that were not here there was a contention between Lucifer and Michael over the body of Moses because kubanga Moses never entered the promises the only thing that we read is that there was a battle instrumental as they were fighting over his pockets that the reason this was because disciples [Applause] Christopher foreign he didn't just bite anywhere in the promises these people had Revelations these people had Revelations because they knew as long as we're in the promised lands amen Hallelujah I repeat myself and guess the mechanism Upon This Rock through us the Chili Peppers foreign [Music] [Applause] no [Applause] foreign the biggest the biggest broadcasting network in UK NBS yes and yes your work is not to be NBS good job hallelujah hallelujah they tried so many instances they tried so many instances because the promise of God was in America foreign look at David foreign we are dealing with the heart remember when it comes and hears the Defiance of this Goliath Korea how can these things be here are people of the promise foreign [Music] but if your heart has been turned to God no matter what comes your way yeah because God is a god of possibilities [Applause] Jonah um David was depending on the problem that is my sense the problem is not that we do not believe the Bible is a Bible we have not just turned back we have not received the Holy quotes when the spirit of truth shall come from now when you have the Holy Ghost we will teach you how to dress he will teach you how to love your wife and your husband that's right we'll teach you how to save me he'll teach you how to run the house sisters he will teach you to be like a modern day Esther a Japanese foreign not the crown singular that is a difference between someone who is Anointed and someone who is check this out you will have some presidents that will come into some authorities but with anointing it also gives you an assurance I may not be crowned yet my day of crowning so it is not the crown that gives you the right and the power to act as a kid someone is we said black Andy you will have a president have the crown yes but look at David had been anointed pushes him to act as a killer myself amen hallelujah I don't know if someone is getting me this is I believe in the three episodes foreign come on you have an issue in your life nobody knows about it the pastor doesn't know your parents your husband or your wife don't know about it yes you are he's willing to grow and then again because when he goes he did not foreign yeah he was yeah yeah exercising kingship over his own kingdom [Music] but the superficial Kings there was a man who had received anointing yeah foreign he even this pastor didn't have he didn't have confidence in his um foreign so he always saw man has been a warrior maybe do you see where you are right now even if you are meeting the youth Goliath that would be worth it has grown so huge now Sarah hey man what is he doing putting confidence make you realize who you are okay go her brother was giving us this story there was this brother who he really used to pray it was such a prayerful young man and whenever he will pray he would really cause Havoc so one day his shoes were just under the bed and that he was going to look for the shoes the brother was not about to go but the devil he was so afraid of his brothers happening give me Sons and Daughters of God give me Sons and Daughters of God have you studied that rightful positions it is we have a huge responsibility we have young people that are fighting the spirit of loudish we cannot start coming to them telling our brothers I'm giving you these quotations we want to move from quotations to manifestations David could not depend on quotations there is a time a lion there is a time amen whatever little experience that God gives you brother sister don't shine it off because he closes from glory to glory when he gives you that Victory will do not just stay there keep on telling the laws oh Showers of Blessings we have received summer foreign your quotations they're actually preventing me from seeing my enemies he's even covering my eyes oh but give me that full-time religion that will make young men denied young women Swift on their feet when the enemy comes give me that all-time religion give them stamina in their life Amina let's say what is happening today if it is possibilities foreign the name of the Lord Karma remember yukida there was this step why are you working at Solomon Bill why were you here and the prayer of Solomon it is that your name will be found there is [Music] there are people that have been identified with the name of the Lord when the Lord comes tell them I will do one two three not for yourself but for my names foreign [Music] foreign when you're casting a demon Muslim in the name of the father and sometimes become people become cartoon they come with a cross even if you hit the Devil with the Bible quotes foreign so the devil has higher Revelation and some of our preachers today because there is only one name [Music] that is the fanciest clothes okay you may not have money but you have something what you have is what I wanted uh but my head hurts um that was not a cross Bear area of the Lord Jesus Christ foreign [Music] to do what to Break Every Chain Break energy the bread that's right my brothers foreign that is why we live today not preaching to ugandans I am preaching to Christians are you people with the name of Christ in them whoever will tell us that the family in heaven Guru and the family goes by one name Lord Jesus Christ now let's go with this I'll come to try to wind up now remember we say that the Turning of the hearts only for the children because it is only the children that will listen the children of Israeli had the gospel of Moses but because they had not been done because they have not gone your heart was still in Egypt you have a representation on the other side [Music] [Applause] you see yourself in Christ foreign foreign foreign foreign uh it is okay now but it is something that is being shown because you want to attract something unless the pressure might be so much money I will wear like my mother said I will dress like my sister because you're finding identification and things that they come so much bombs and all this explosions and the war was so much got into some PTSD trauma and they developed Amnesia he didn't know who he was just been taken in a trip somewhere else and they happened to Embark from the training to come off from the tree and they were walking along the fields and as he was walking down the path the supervisors the people are taking care of him and they said let us not stop him you might have been lost foreign he had found his way back because there was something in here foreign foreign then Faith loses but faith is a substance Lord I just believe it anymore so this morning I just want to speak to someone I do not know how my life has been Lord I know that I'm your son I do not care how the world I do not even care

this land there was nothing there comes at 10 that there will be no rain and then this land here and say no oh God here from Heaven if they will have sinned oh God here from Heaven the condition was
