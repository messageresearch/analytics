that shall he speak and he will show you things to count [Music] the holy spirit uh of the holy spirit does not necessarily mean that you have the holy spirit by the way what i'm about to say now is only foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] if [Music] [Applause] [Music] can imagine [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Applause] [Applause] what [Music] by the yes spirit on your spirit to do those things in your souls foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] unto christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are no longer under a school master verse 26 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus can you read that brother where for the lord was our school master to bring us unto christ can he just interpret directly [Music] amen that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school master for ye are all children of god by faith in christ jesus you know who a school master is a teacher someone who trains you up someone who tells you what to do someone who tells you what not to do someone who guides you someone who prepares you someone who rebukes you [Music] are you following me all this is the work of a teacher but now we realize when all this is the work of the holy spirit the holy spirit is supposed to teach you the holy spirit is supposed to guide you the holy spirit is to show you things to come again to protect you but before you receive the holy ghost that is the work of the school master [Music] [Music] i is for you to be people who usually have a problem with preachers or what the bible says is are those people who do not have the holy spirit that's why if someone is doing something wrong and it's corrected if he has the true holy spirit oh he will humble himself children do not have choices before the age of accountability [Music] that child cannot even be taken to to caught alone because they have not reached the age of accountability they have choices by the virtue of the fact that they are human beings [Music] that power now that you get identified oppressed actually when i preached on that summon the power of female agencies [Music] i went back home [Music] [Music] [Music] after [Music] that power to exercise your power [Music] [Applause] without the knowledge of your father and if your father gets to know about italian [Music] [Music] over you your mother has a right over here to tell you what to do to tell you and some people say well you know let them be the way they want to be you know you for us we just give birth to the flesh now let me tell you something [Applause] god is going to hold you responsible because the parents have decided not to take over the responsibility that god has given to them [Music] and the husband is the king of his home that man must have his house his family under subjection he must be able to control his house he must be able to control [Music] oh [Applause] father nothing the way a man has control over the house mom who said there were a number to train up their children in the ways of god so that the with gloves [Music] if someone is doing something wrong you know is so they can love [Music] and some preachers will tell you that they are telling you to do things because they are led by the spirit of faith and they don't find what they are telling you to do in the bible run away you know telling women to leave their husbands to marry another one those are the ones you know you know you know bringing divorces those are the ones telling you to you know bring a gallons of oil they just power power power on you [Music] [Music] [Music] you you don't come here for me to entertain you can we tell my number you say i am not a comedian i am a servant of god i am a preacher tell them you position hallelujah amen the choices before the holy spirit are all that the children america always come out [Music] ask you ask him to make a choice of who he's going to marry no more what will he what will he use as a business [Music] a woman a woman who looks like this american height [Music] [Music] [Music] because if they make choices before they receive the holy spirit when they are still young you know they will make them according to the last of the flesh we talked about [Music] [Music] decisions [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you don't have the holy spirit because the holy spirit is humble they say that the holy spirit is god christ is a gentleman christo they would be there baby down asking him who do you think you are where is that what do you call yourself where are you so if you don't believe i am he never killed his auntie you will die in your sins [Music] this no man has ever spoken like this man and again who is he though before abram now you are even beginning to blaspheme but you didn't say no football but he was so humble who was jesus christ yes he was god himself yes yes but the bible says he accepted to go on the cross almost naked ashamed of him never quite when so it's hard to put off the lights the moon shut down and you always watch the sun shut down shut down we cannot see but [Music] [Music] yes a parent is a school master before faith has come oh [Music] so you mommies cut him with a mama well i should have said mamas that is matata you ought to tell your children don't dress that up don't do that do that [Music] do you know that the holy spirit has his own laws if you can't even obey the laws of your mother and your father do you think you can obey the laws of you of the holy spirit the work of the father the mom [Music] [Music] [Music] your pastor your mother your father they all train you soon preparing you to receive christ in your heart and i want to read something here about bringing up a child he says you know what i think everybody has his own opinion but one of the greatest and to my opinion the greatest president that we ever had in this nation in the usa he says was abraham lincolnin [Music] abraham lincoln not because he was a republican but he says uh let me go down here because he was a godly man [Music] he was raised to serve god yes [Music] foreign if there is anything that i want to praise to give praise to he said my life was influenced by a godly mother who told me to pray and to know jesus as my savior [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the lord do you realize many of you here mochiman many of the things that you do right you attribute them to your mothers [Music] [Applause] [Music] i still remember when my wife many times tells me that she's going to fast and pray if she's going to pray for her children she reminds me that my mother told them we used to do this when i was with my mom you should do like this fasting would go and pray with god and i remember oh yeah no wonder she's doing the same thing with her children and when it comes to me and i saw my mom somewhere here on zoom my momma and grandmother be quiet no she's listening to that i'm not saying this because i know she's listening [Music] we would go into conventions somehow i do not know why she liked me among all the others but she would always tell me come we go to the convention [Music] and i was very young seven years yeah sometimes i wasn't even understanding what they were saying [Music] you know i went on like any child would do that i went away wondering and i think i saw a man you know in the neighborhood from the convention center so they had that plate of the head of that animal on the on the plate [Music] so when i saw it the man told me you see this head is of a person i will also eat you now but now with what the whole the convention i remember [Music] whenever you have sister agnes what how many i don't know how many you are never making each and every one of you let me tell you you have an opportunity amen to send ambassadors ambassadors he was brought up the acquisition meant to kill yakuza the egyptians can he imagine brother brother brilliant organ of brilliance can you imagine [Applause] they did not know i'll give these people away from here remember my boy mothers that opportunity is in your hands don't let the devil deceive you don't take your place say them and support you father take your place don't say they are small no they are not small as long as they have ears as long as they can see [Music] it's an opportunity to bring forth a train of children and you see here that's why you young man in what kind of mother is she going to be and the only way you can know should be a good mother is by how her mother raised [Music] what she has been eating and feeding on [Music] are you really listening to me now my name is and and but the banham says that that president abraham wrinkling in america was the greatest president that he has ever known why because that her mother his mother told him to pray and also to know jesus [Music] if you are drunk and your family will be drunk not even because it is in the blood sometimes people think that you know this thing has been going through the bloody she's not in the blood [Music] my father's father's father [Music] have been changed the life in me it is that of jesus christ the blood in me the messiah is the blood of jesus christ all the things in my past sending me back [Music] [Music] if you also pick something from your father i hope someone else will join me your father used to do this [Music] because like an exterior gohan's check we're gonna know okay you grew up seeing that you you grew up saying that what could have been about and they never put it on you satan and made you think it is in the blood no no worse than to be no it's not in the blood those things you grew seeing them and you thought that that is a part of you [Music] it is not in the blood mossad not even witchcraft it is what you grew up seeing [Music] and it has influenced you you grew in that atmosphere but when you are when someone is born from a poor family [Music] if someone is born from a family oh my gosh where their father has never driven [Music] and their father's until another generation rises if none of your people in your lineage [Music] ever went into an aircraft none of them in your lineage has even ever bought a motorcycle [Music] and you know when they grow up seeing mommy's suffering that is suffering they think i will also have to suffer the way they suffered i don't even know where i'm preaching this for someone come on yeah seeing all his fathers and fathers fathers suffering time oh take them slaves take all their youth will never ever immediately hope and they would go again and plant again they became servants of the medianites [Music] you know trying to have this doing at the harvesting work and when the immediate came in oh he knew they have come again he was hiding himself hallelujah this man was a very powerful man themselves [Music] me i i hope you missed your chance you are talking to me son of a defeated man [Music] yeah please don't just mistake it [Music] [Music] i i i think you met the son of business a son of god i think you met christ you're powerful but you are a man god is saying you're powerful but he said you can make it god is saying you no one even has ever got 1 [Music] freedom every [Music] [Applause] he went and obeyed now go on you realize okay okay all right let me see i told him go and take me can you try that but god before we do this i am not yet sure i want to be sure you are meaning i'm going to put this thing today uh [Music] they go to an army you know the story how they

slowly very important and you hear what they're saying you know is [Applause] why do you [Music] as a believer of this message it's your turn now to surprise that devil jesus hallelujah amen the only thing you have to do is to stop questioning surprise even yourself now and when we surprise the devil where when he says return and he will not know what to do with you because he will realize this is about the news [Music] victory [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] what are your fears be keep your tears put them aside and believe god brother shame organization put them aside and believe god your family is what you are familiar i'm realizing i'm even not halfway on the first page okay you raise your child in a certain environment it's got 98 better chance to go right than it was if you bring that in the wrong way bring up a child in the way that it should go and when it's old we will not depart from it [Music] if you are a clean person mother even if your children are not involved when you're left at home alone hallelujah [Music] is always shady at home this is the woman she does not prepare the house flies are everywhere the suspect is falling there and those neighbors you are talking with them things that are not as good as a christian well you're gonna never neighborhood everything they come to you talking about their husbands i'm proud bring up a child in the way it should please bring me a glass of water your children are learning they are taking that to the next generation [Music] the way i teach my children how to be honest elizabeth [Music] [Music] [Music] yes i'm sorry [Music] and you'll not get your strokes and you know what there is a power in that the child learns honesty and they learn the word of god also [Music] [Music] [Music] to be square and fair even when they're in school it's your job brother i don't know [Music] where [Music] that can do now many times children are prone to copy off of one another and i see that in my children someone comes at home in one minute she came she's behaving like that person are you talking like that person are you moving like that person in one minute these children are still learning they are prone to copy off from one another [Music] but that's not good that your students try to they try to press their way through school [Music] and then it's something you appreciate you can appreciate your good

says do the right do right he has a slogan [Music] [Music] and you think right another one you are bound to come out right now hallelujah [Music] yes sir don't let your mind be cast down don't kill those that you there's a way you put here confidence i think [Music] [Music] yes that's what i want to read did you get it brother [Music] which has great recompense of reward [Music] hallelujah testimony of after testimony after testimony you know where i call to tell you what my god can do hallelujah he can do the impossible he can move you when you think you can move amen he can make you

chinese is stupid [Music] no no no and by the way by the end of the of of this series you will see where i am going many people are be like you you cannot talk tanks that's for pentecostals enemies you can [Laughter] this is something very important i want to quote organ he said no man can go higher and go higher than their pastor yeah you can make them and the terrible one too i kind of feel i'm about to finish by the way i'll just finish complete this subject later but i want i just feel to address this a little bit and so again in the message in the message pigment church age you can either preach your brother you can get it it says the hidden manner emmanuel a little something special what is special i can't trust the blessings of the holy ghost the blessings of the holy ghost no that is for the whole congregation but the hidden manner name man was a special revelation because he had to teach the others was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he would teach others that is the man of god or the pastor hey hey man you will never leave no higher than your pastor you remember that hey now let's pause right there many people have read this about [Music] no sheep can claim to be higher than the and that is what is happening with the denomination now what does the prophet mean here together even in the message god blesses your pastor of that special revelation to be able to bless you now you can't go above it now if your pastor is not having it yes in our church there is women and preachers our pastors but it's okay for me i don't believe it them but i don't believe it next she kills them it's not right it is up to the church my dear quran you cannot be higher than that if your leaders are going to hell you are going to help too i couldn't [Laughter] so if if you call me on the rapture morning and i'm still here just know we are all doomed [Laughter] oh hallelujah [Music] calling me doing those things just now you're finished because you are going to be not higher than what is telling you [Music] we were reading the message in the church edge of the power of god will follow hallelujah amen i believe if we are the true church of god there must be true manifestations in our meetings and i'm not talking only about times that is good it must be there there's no power it must be there is nobody if they are not there it's a clear sign there himself in our lives [Music] you must be in a position whereby you can say last year i was like this but this year i'm not like this [Music] if i'm pastoring someone you know for the first year second year i can't help them chica can see that there are similar queens because i believe this message will preach overcome number two if i'm i'm if i'm the right person god has sent to you when [Music] you might be stunted and you don't know but i thank god that we are progressing us the testament of how you receive the holy spirit and i'm about to finish and i said by the marvin he came brother joel you know brought him around and he's been around he was always a very quiet brother like that no smile nothing but you know something happened all of a sudden and it's just one example yesterday [Music] i came

and ministers to them sometimes i was i was giving a testimony i've not been a part of it yet but i've been given a testimony now for now you know that god moves in in that prayer you know you you must get to that level [Music] [Applause] [Music] we must train the children truly not in the cabin if we don't train them [Music] and that testimony must reflect in your spiritual and physical life i'll probably do this though i used to be this but nowadays we used to be powerful one time we would pray one time the power of god would come down one time you people are joking but you are you still like that now your child will hurt you so you are also joking we want to see that god that you had then let him be manifested now [Music] some of you who used to come in the church some people chew um as if they are goats others they they use phones if you in the message and you use a phone in the chat you have a very big problem all over you um i noticed some of those sisters they started changing
