I got were in first ter form five after that I didn't I don't think I crossed Five Points till I I finished my a level those were my best points I used to get 3 three3 and at the end of the year promotional exams I got five points and I was below the promotion line so they asked me to repeat form five so I felt bad and I came I shared with some people talk to many people around who advise me they told me no don't waste so I decided to to to go back to school to go for they they had an option of promoting me but they make me sit under another Center and that Center we were sitting with prisoners were sitting with old people was sitting with people who who had failed like very old people very old men people who are coming back for for Education just maybe to get a course so it was so humiliating but I decided to take it like that so I I went I started school and we used to form groups people who are in that Center encourage each other be like uh in the world they don't care where School you are in as long as you have your point those things don't matter so I went to school with that mind so I accepted that I'm going to sit with them so in it was it was actually after physics practical and then the deputy steps in and he's like he reads our name and he says you have a problem with your you name stuff so come to my office so when he went to his office he told us you people you're very lucky he told us that they sat as a group and discussed about our results this was now in form six and then they decided to take us back to the school c i i i told my friends that it's because of me that you've been transferred yeah so I thank God for that that and then when results came out recently I thank God very much I I beat almost very many people who are in the school Center

your word however short or long I pray may you minister to us Lord may you encourage somebody that has come here expecting to hear from above minister to us I pray in Jesus name amen amen Give the Lord a c of Praise as you turn to your Bible in the Book of Numbers Chapter 11 amen thank you musicians God bless you we read from 10 in the Book of Numbers Chapter 11 amen you know sometimes when the spirit of worship comes down you just want to worship Him endless but I think he is all that matters to us is that true to you God bless you amen we read in numbers 11 up to 15 then Moses had the people weep throughout the their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly Moses also was displeased and Moses said unto the the Lord wherefore hast thou Afflicted thy servant excuse me and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all these people upon me have I conceived all these people have I begotten them that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bossom as a nursing father beareth the sacking child unto the land which thou um sorest unto their fathers whence should I have flesh to uh give unto all these people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat I am not able to Bear all these people alone because it is too heavy for me and if thou deal thus with me kill me Moses became angered and now he's fighting with in his prayer with me I pray thee out of hand if I have found favor in thy sight and let me not seek my wretchedness brother you can read that from vers 11 um from vers 11 to 15 for for [Music] amen may the Lord have blessings upon have your seat we have also those who just joined us now sister from Nana please raise up your hand so we can right over there the back bless and also Brother David fromo I don't know where is right over here God bless youcome welcome brother and also brother Benjamin from mjam amen uh um also sister Stella this morning uh she sent greetings to the church she um has uh gone to be with her husband at at his church they still in theiron yesterday they were celebrating their 25 year what we normally call the silver jubile and uh we really we were happy to be there with them together with their family and I don't see much of their family here this morning I I think they have gone to to be with their dad I see po over there and otherwise we are so happy for them and we are happy oh did you mention sister PE where is she I can't see her sometimes you think actually I'm seeing you when I'm not seeing you you know when a pastor preaches something then someone says Ah he was talking about me even looked at me and pointed at me but many times I'm not really seeing so if that gets to happen that service is yours God was having you in mind not the preacher and also uh we should also congratulate brother and sister m stand up they they also celebrating their 5 year anniversary yes come [Applause] in you hold her like your bride don't leave her behind let us clap for them hallelujah amen amen amen so we celebrate every year that every couple spends in marriage it's a testament of resilience love so God bless you amen we we had to do that because we have those who just and the way I see brother uh are you always love calling you brother and sometimes I call Alan I don't know where your bride is to your bride before these people are married they usually want to be together after the marriage in church one will sit I I I love the way uh brother and Mrs Baka are sit amen you should always see married people in the church and if the other one doesn't sit near to the husband after the service go ask them are you all right only excuse people like sister Ruth whose husband is quite far yeah so I saw how when we were at the um event yesterday and uh I I fa I said oh God may you answer our prayer most of the people were seated with their husband she was the one seated in the alone but God knows you and your husband will come back quickly amen how many are happen to be in the amen I'm also happy to be in the house of the Lord Brother Neville I'm happy to see you it's been a while and that I think that is Sister Stella we already announced that she will not be around we happy to see her along with fortunate and is that your sister-in-law and uh and uh you're all welcome God bless you so much amen so this morning by gra by the grace of God we just want to get into the word brother emuel uel we are delighted that you are here today your this brother was uh I should say that the devil wanted him dead but God said no before your time amen is this Brother David I'm happy to see you Brother David if you could come and stand so that people can see you this is the brother I I told you about time fromo amen you here with some of your family members okay God bless you so much happy to be with you amen so this morning I just want to speak on a subject um I am but a [Music] man okay tell your neighbor I am but a man and maybe for an inspiration a man under Divine assignment [Music] I believe I am but a man but I am a man under Divine assignment and I am convinced that this morning I'm speaking to many like me so if you are like me a man not an angel a man then um this sermon is for you this amen we have taken a portion of scripture from The Book of Numbers here Moses was under special assignment he was under a Divine assignment we did not come into the world to look around we are here on Divine assignment there is a one time a sermon I preached and I titled it um Divine connection for a Divine Purpose I almost preach it again this morning but then I'll take another turn today I believe with the people we meet in this life there is no one we meet by accident even you who is here this morning you are not here by accident and by the way good and bad people whoever you meet in this life there is a Divine appointment that God has planned before the foundation of the world you see to to be able to bring you to your purpose to be able to bring you to your go God given assignment now I remember I was in M as a young boy and they are you know raised in a family a Christian homean home but also they were part of the East African Revival we call it a movement so we were part of that it was not by coincidence even the family you were raised in was not by coincidence you should stop beating yourself and blaming yourself blaming your mother your father your friend your situations many of us don't progress to know the purpose of God for our Liv because we are always too good at muring and blaming we should begin seeing God in everything we should begin seeing God in everything that happen because if you are a child of God everything about you is planned everything about you is plan the good the bad the everything about you is a plan nothing is out of uh it's it's life nothing is wrong even the places you went through before even the places where you are now even the plac where you you are to be by God's grace I will show you everything is planned you are here to fulfill Your Divine assignment and you see and then you know in that family I get you know to Ane I think it was 11 and we had finished um the the they call I don't know how to confirmation ceremony after learning after being told for a while then the bishop comes and now he confirms and you know I would go before everybody and you know you have to walk majes even the cross we don't just felt we are really there that we are serving God you see that was by Divine appointment because go the journey was still moving God was still leading me so these denominations were of God or of the devil they are of God is the shark of the devil or of God it is of god but you see the seed cannot be here with a shark the SE the seed needs the shark but when the seed is rapen then the shark is not necessary so some of us or most of us have gone through the Shar we have gone through the process you know even when maze is growing it grows through all that kind of Stam and everything but it is not needed but there is a season there is a time when it is necessary so where you were before it was all necessary that you be here this morning so please pay attention to what is being said because by Divine appointment you are supposed to be here this morning and take you uh to my Palace because I was the one who was chosen to give the Thanksgiving speech and I spoke and I touched his hand and I found favor in his and he said Let Me Take You My Mother accepted right away my father did not accept you know he was also a priest and all that but he wanted to be with us to raise us himself but by God's grace and I say God's grace because there's nothing that can frustrate that grace of God every phase of life you will go through to attain what God has planned for you to attain Redemption has season one time we'll talk about that but then we see later on I come and begin living with the bishop and and then one time um so for the first time in my life at 13 years I was given a Pulpit in a big church of about 400 people that night I never slept I was shaking because they told me to tomorrow you'll be and I know when the bishop visits a place there so many people that come many many every so before everybody I was to be there it was by Divine appointment and um I I I by the time I came to the pool no they are not as small as this they are very large and you have to climb to go there so as I was climbing my feet was shaking my feet was shaking and then I reached there my Bible you know was in I started reading the scripture and preach when I started reading then the anointing Came Upon and I preached and many people came to give their life to Jesus about 100 people those were my first Souls War to Lord in the Anglican Church the bishop came and he prayed over them the blessing of the father and of the Son and the ghost amen but within all that God was leading his child and at 15 um long St short God in the place where the bishop took me that same city that same town God had something in mind to introduce this message to me so if I had not been in the Ang if I had not met the people I met if I had not come toana I would not have known this message and if I had not known this message I would not have known who I am and if I had not known who I am maybe I would have missed the Rapture so can I would I be right to say I was everything was under Divine appointment tell your neighbor you are not here by AC nothing happens by accident to a child of God nothing happens by accident and nothing happens by coincidence everything that happens in your life you must begin to learn to appreciate God and thank him for leading you because the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous who are the Righteous the ones who have been forn the ones who have been predestinated and been chosen in him before the foundation of the world those people they are footsteps are ordered of the Lord now I believe your footsteps are being ordered of the Lord but you see you are a human being but you are a human being under Divine assignment you must Find Your Divine assignment and God even before you were born he knew what you will do when you are born he knew what you will accomplish but the reason why many people don't do what God wanted them to do because they are not sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit to know what God is doing many people miss it I was in the city of Adis Ababa the first time we went there and then we were singing I was with a brother from Nairobi and um we were singing I don't remember the song but we were walking on the streets and singing and then there's a man who tapped on my shoulder and he said Hallelujah hallu turn to see later on I would find out he's a pastor and his name is John I I'll withhold the other name and then we sat down because we so excited to find someone who is a Christian and as we sat down there he looked at us and then he looked me in the eyes and he said I see a light there is a light on on your head and I see that you have a pure message God has sent to this country with a pure message and it is for the entire country and he has given you an open and no man will close it now when he say those words I was excited not because um I already knew what he was saying already I knew the devil knew that there was someone going to be born under a Divine assignment to destroy my kingdom we are born into the kingdom of God to destroy the kingdom of dark and here is the good news the devil knows it by the way the devil knows who you are it is only you who has not realized yet who you are but the devil knows if you're a child of God the devil knows you if you want to try it you go to nightclub they will ask you people who don't even know you even you are here cuz they will realize you are a different person many times you walk out there we even dressing Cas and someone says oh Pastor have you ever met me but you look like people know you the devil knows you God knows you you know [Music] yourself listen the devil knew uh Moses and Moses was born and the devil thought he would kill him but you see he cannot kill someone who has a Divine assignment if if you have a purpose in this world the devil cannot finish you before your time there is no amount of suffering that will finish you before your die there is no amount of lack of fear or whatever even your birth circumstances cannot finish you before you time we have to stop being sorry about families we were born in we have to stop being sorry about the situations we found ourselves in we have to stop being sorry about even the things we found that happen in our life because everything is happening by Design why because there is a Divine assignment for me for you let's start together as I build this and then Moses reached a Time and then they picked him and um you know and they took him to the Palace of the and when I was thinking about that I thought about myself going to Pharaoh's Palace but you know friends you too some of you were in Pharaoh's [Music] pal great Prestige and power money but no word not true how many were there look at those hands some of you were not but most of you I in those palaces and here I mean any denomination that is not word best and Moses was there Moses was trained for 40 years and Moes now got um this kind of thinking that he's now one of the best he can now destroy all the enemies he has the power he has the authority he was almost the next Pharaoh listen and by saying this before I continue if you go to the lineage of Cain the lineage of C there were great people the people who had gone into great education programs people who understood all Myst to the extent they even wanted to build a tower to reach God and even God said they will they were going to fulfill these were knowledgeable men there are people of power and influence but when you go to the line of of sat they were humble people they were shepherds they did not have much accolades in this life if you read in the New Testament the Bible says not many great are called not many Rich are called I tell you for sure if you look at all the demographics the whole world and you look at Christianity there are very few Christians who are great people in this life most of the Christians most of the Jesus followers are humble people they don't have much in this life they don't have much to to to to to to tie on they don't have high high education qualifications they don't have you know big buildings they don't own molds and you know airplanes and and good things there are few who do the Bible says so there are few there few Among Us and those who were put among us we also put Among Us for a purpose if you find yourself in the body of Christ and you have in this material world more things than others it is not for you unless if you're not a sincere Christian but if you're a sincere Christian and you have more than others whatever you have is for the entire body so you must always be given to the distribution of the Saints amen that's the purpose why God makes some of us rich God his economy is very good he doesn't want his children to beg out those who have he says give especially in the household first in here then out there so if you have anything in this life it is not for you and for your family only it is for the body of Jesus Christ amen and we will find out more on that now we see there are not many children of God who have great things in this now you can debate with that but you go and and make your research you will not find much many of them were were what we would call Poor to the extent the disciples came to Jesus and they said for sure we who have left our houses our families our things what are we going to get in return because they realize this thing is true but it doesn't have much to it there are many people who have refused to preach this message not because it is not true but because if you preach this you will not get much money the message the kind of message we preach in message churches all over the world is not one that will make a Pastor Rich it cannot I will be sincere with you all you younger preachers here if you have been planning on that American kind of Dream by this message you better find another message because this message the purpose of this message is not to enrich us in worldly goods and materials no God will provide don't don't make a mistake with that he will always provide but I'm talking about enriching ourselves like what you see happen out there oh and then they drive private JS and drive huge cars and bigs and all is owned by a pastor why because he has made many collection from the people and the people give will because of the man is Anointed are you saying we have no anointing in the message sure we have anointing in the message but with the way we operate is we don't measure on a minor we measure on the major and the Maj is the soul the major is the rapture the Maj is the coming of the Lord the rest is just an addition so you can never preach this message expecting to become rich because for sure the way we preach to you you don't even want to give us a lot of money because we don't make you happy but if I come here on one Sunday morning even if it is a message church and I make you happy prach what you want to hear you'll be so happy that even your it will be but the gospel I found in the Bible is that which is of without money without price freely you have received fre that is our divine assignment to preach Christ amen not to preach to make you happy but to preach Christ into your heart that you may get an experience with God amen if God blesses you with worldly Goods we thank God and he has taught us how we can be blessed with the worldly things by working hard I hope I'm not offending some already someone say Pastor don't you think that believing the message is already making you rich no you can go to heaven poor you can go to heaven Rich it doesn't matter but if you want to be rich work he promised a blessing as long as you you walk and you follow the kingdom principles there is a blessing to eat that's why when we preach this message We Don't Preach a message of receive receive it receive it this message is a higher Revelation higher understanding but but let me take you deeper here in the life of so you will understand what I'm talking about now um I'll quote first of all in the message Fellowship our Prophet says each one of us has a different Ministry so meaning each one of us has a Ministry each one works different each one of you has a Ministry a separate Ministry all that come into Christ has a Ministry not one not only the preacher but you have a Ministry to something something you can do and I hope this doesn't sound sacriligious but usually God has to drive you into your ministry I am showing you that when you come to the Lord there is a Divine assignment you if you've not found it amen it is going to find you this morning the assignment is going to find you this morning there is something you must do every one of us sisters brothers young preachers and non prach all of us have a Ministry and this is something that you can do that's why you should never accept to be a dant Body of Christ imagine if you have hands that are not cannot touch anything feet that can't MO you are lame and many parts of the body are dment you see a brother you see a sister who will never be useful in the body there is something you can do you are here for a Divine assignment there is something you and I can do but you see usually God will dri you into your ministry you can drive yourself into some Ministry but God will always drive you into your correct in 1 Corinthians 12 it says now ye are the body of Christ and your members in particular and God has said some in the church first apostles Prophets teachers then Miracles gift of healing helps governments I don't know whether you call it but I think governments is you know management and all that kind of thing diversities of tongues all and and then he asks a question are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with Tong do all interpret the answer is obviously no but in verse four he says there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same Lord there are diversities of operations but the same God who work all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man every man to profit with for to one is given by the spirit Word of Wisdom to another word of knowledge to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing to another working of mirac to another prophecy Des signing of spirits of um and another one diverse kinds of times and another one interpretation of times but all these work that one it says work that one and the self Same Spirit divide into every man sever as he will for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ and there are many many many Ministries it could be just marriage you're just a housewife that's a big big Ministry could be a husband it's a Ministry a father is Ministry mother so family is Minister own that's why the Bible even qualifies a pastor he says if a pastor if someone wants to be a pastor he must be first a successful father and husband you read your Bible in the book of First Timothy he says he if a man does not know how to rule his own house how shall he rule over the Church of God so if a pastor's home goes you know breaks apart many still insist I have the calling I have the calling you may have the calling but you don't have the qualification because what qualifies you is your success at home there is no way you can make the Church of God Prosper if your wife and children and and and home is not [Music] prospering so first you prosper your then the Church of God and it's the same qualifications even for deacons you see they must be married to one wife not two not three and they must be prospering marriage they must be prospering in their family if someone is the one who always beats his wife he does not qualify even to be a Deon because he has not prospered there so you see that these are all Ministries some people are given to prayer praying for the church praying for the needs of the people you know you know that is maybe a calling that you have and you know you don't want to do it some of God will drive you into it it's not because you want to do it it's because God himself will drive you into that you see it might be music musicians and administrators and media Department whatever you are this is all Ministry even cleaning the church it's all Ministry helping it's all Ministry you know um whether you children or young or other all of you can be used by the Lord you all have a Ministry and here I will continue here on this quote it says some Methodist Brethren the other day had just received the Holy Ghost there are farmers up in Indiana they was just all on fire and he said I've been reading some books and he said brother bam should we all come together now and seek our ministry and seek for our ministry did you hear that many people try to do that oh let me go on the mountain and pray for 30 days and seek for my Ministry have you heard of that before it's not the way we do it there is no God called Minister that will seek their Ministry actually every God called Minister will try to run away from their Min and you find the ones who want always to do something they are the ones who don't have the anointing for it they the ones who don't have the calling for you find it true even if it's just we can take it as low marriage issue you find that the woman goes to a man and begins to talk about our the man is not interested because you're not supposed to seek yourself the man is supposed to seek brother are you praying about marriage what are you thinking about a sister who does that is of a bad character he's of a bad character the husband seeks you he seeks you and he finds you and he picks you how many here sld themselves Jesus s us we never [Applause] our you don't seek Lord seeks I am here because he me the more I continue to run the more you Contin seeking after me and I am here today because he found me Hallelujah amen that's why salvation is not your work it is a work of God Amen God will accomplish it he started it by dying on the cross he will finish it by saying all the savable who are the savable those who he chosen him before the foundation of the world they are the savable I am one of them I am savable if you are savable when you hear the word you will recognize it you will have something like we call whatever something like I remember this this is familiar you you may even hear it for the first time but something in will say I relate with that I believe that that sounds like home to respond to the word of God so he so us even Ministry you don't have to go this man came here and asked by the should we come together and we we all pray and seek our ministry but B answer and he said I said no you will Rin yourself doing that you will rein yourself doing that I said you don't do that I said a man that always seeking for God to do something such and such and such things usually don't amount to very much it is the man that doesn't want to do it it is the man it is the man that doesn't want to do it that's the one that God can use look at give me money give me money if you give me money I am going to buy the church land if you give me money I'm going to do this see Believers in church are suffering if you give me money I am going to help other one that's the man that will never do it if you want to know yourself see where you are now and what you're doing now is what you will do when you get a lot more than what you don't have if you have 5,000 and you can't give 3,000 to God even if you get 40 million you can't give him one million are you that's why many of your prayers are not answered listen and things like that God knows he would you know God you use word here God knows that he such a person would be a stuffed shirt so he just takes somebody that doesn't want to do it and say maybe I can use him a little while till he gets to be one you remember ABS the son of um uh of um of David I believe it was and then this boy you know was going down to the gates waiting for the people to come so he can tell them oh you want to see my father yes we have an issue here don't bother my father my father is very busy but don't worry me I'm around I'm around I can help you and then they then he handles them and they and they go away say it is a very good brother here he's even better than our King and then eventually he sto their hearts he sto their hearts and then he caused a REV happen but did he ever become a king he died before he became aing he was not the man for the job it is always the man who runs away God doesn't want to look at this one I qualify he leaves that one and he goes for the one running away and he says you come I want to use you there is a work for you to do hallelujah amen it's the same yesterday to Forever this is always the way God works and this applies in every everywhere amen so some of you who have been waiting to serve it's not about you qu it is not about you put yourself putting yourself in the position it's about God choosing you so that's about it you try to get away from it all the time great Ministries has always been somebody trying to get away from [Music] it because let God do something for them and then they all puffed up how great and everything but a man that doesn't want to do it he just forced to to do it and then he wants to get away from it as big as he can that's the way usually God works now we look at Moses Moses was trained up in the Pharaoh Palace for a number of years 40 years and I want now to show you here in the Bible if you can open with me to the book of um Exodus and I want you to look at um chapter 2 vers 11 and it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out into his uh unto his Brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied on Egyptians smiting and Hebrew one of his breth and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he SLE the Egyptians and the son and when he went out of the second day behold two men of the Hebrews stro together and he said to to him that did wrong why do you smite your fellow and he said who made you a prince and a judge over us intend thou to kill me as thou killed the Egyptian and Moses feared and said surely this thing is known now I want you to see Moses felt empowered he was empowered by education imagine if you have been educated by the best for 40 years Moses was empowered by education Moses was empowered according to him he felt his own efforts he was able to serve Israel and he today we would call it theology you know man you see they have the big titles h d l l d and and many other powerful loud titles the world gives them accolades and the world Praises them if you mention yourself as um uh p h d l l d s s what what [Music] by the time you mention your name people already shaking this must be a big person one day I was in um at some airport I met a man from Nigeria and I asked him his name by the time he mentioned his name I was already tired because he mentioned a lot of tit apostle the most Prophet you know bishop and and then finally later on he mentioned the name I am so glad we have received a prophet in our generation who has preached a sermon BL famous names we are delivered from that amen hallelujah we have pastors we have brothers and pastors are brothers and brothers are pastors hallelujah amen men of God are men there is something I'm trying to build to here if you want to be used by God you must realize you are nothing you have nothing you can do nothing you have to humble yourself you have to see nothing good about yourself but here is a man called Dr Moses I don't know the titles they were giving at that time maybe honorable honorable you know the most whatever you know man in the all of you know Egypt and all those titles then they say Moses he comes out of that kind of training and he feels the strength you know they say I feel the anointing is it the anointing of theology or the anointing of the word but I'm so glad God still has people anointed by the true spirit of God who respond to the true word of God Amen and and so they were anointed by the word but here Moses was not anointed by the word he was anointed by training he was anointed by education and by the way make no mistake I we support education but I'm saying when you are serving God you put all your education aside we don't care whether you you have a a PhD or l l or you know when it comes to serving God you forget about all those things or whether you have a bachelor or a diploma some people they just can't can't can't operate without thinking about what they have achieved in this life you have to think of yourself as though you are n and here this man came and uh he looked at this man fighting he knew he was a Jew but he had all his authority so he said you why are you killing your neighbor why you fighting so he looked here looked here this is a man who is very don't know the word to use very subtle wisdom look around no one then he got this man M his name and then he came out hallelujah hallelujah you know he's a man of God how many believe mes is a man of God he was a man of did you actually know Moses mured [Music] like but there's a difference between Andes I want you to understand it's not the action is the person that is deep if you receive but then this man murdered this man and buried him and he came out as if nothing happened and the next time he came out ready to do the same you so now this time it was two Hebrews fighting he looked at the one who did wrong you why are you doing this this said ah you want to kill me the way you killed the other that's when Moses realized I am busted so I am known so my weakness is discovered I can't serve God now what was it doing in the beginning don't you ever think he was murdering he thought he was actually saving his and oh my God help us that's what all these denominations are doing they are murdering the people but they think they saving by preaching wrong Doctrine by preaching the Trinity do by accepting things the Bible by telling everybody speak T the Bible is very clear how the gift of T must operate by teaching disgrace instead of teaching real Grace they are doing what muring the people telling them it doesn't matter what you drink God SE your heart not your body they are Ming those women they don't know they think they saving them why because of theology because of their church doctr let me tell you brother it doesn't matter the education you have it doesn't matter which level of understanding you think you on until you humble yourself and you and you know that God has to lead you you are nothing this Moses was uh you know muring these people thinking is saving that's the organized Church religion that's what they doing even this morning some people are being murdered this this they're being murdered and they don't know they don't know they going to they are going to altars but altars they the sacrifice they being sacrific but friends we must go an altar where Christ is the sacrifice Hallelujah where our work should be to receive the word amen just receive the word if you don't receive the word you are you yourself being sacrificed you are losing your soul but if you receive the word you are receiving the sacrifice that has already been given amen but we see here amen that Moses when he realized his weakness was discovered I'm sure his feet must have he realized all the training he had received from the best military school in the world was now nothing at first he felt empowered but when his weakness was discovered in him he realized he was so weak and Brethren may God help us to realize we are so weak that we can be a now to come to a place as I show you that Moses came where I can be able to confess that I am but a [Music] man in the message absolute Moses why he had tried to save the life of those poor Hebrews almost as bad off these two children are were trying to save to it says these were slaves and they killed them just at random whenever they wanted to Moses filed in his heart that you know that was not the will of God so he tried to do it through education he tried to do it through his own efforts and found out that he miserably failed he did something that wasn't right because he took another man's life and that was not right when I was in the Anglican Church for two years I tried to save my people but I found out I was just murdering them but then the great light The Shining Light the word of God shined my way shined your way and we came out of her the Bible says come out of all my people who is she she's a false religion this message is are calling out come out of them come out of organized religion come out of manmade systems go where not into another denomination not into another church go into Christ we have been called not just to start a movement Hallelujah but to come into Christ and you know I always say we are everywhere in the world we are not organized but we are not disorganized our head is Christ Our headquarter is in heaven our Arch Bishop is Jesus Christ our Authority is the Bible That's The Bride of Jesus Christ that's the Church of Christ that he said is coming back forth who has no spot no wrinkle but washing the blood of the amen am can you say Amen in the book of Exodus chapter 3 and then here now Moses has realized he is he says come now there God talks to him I will send the to Pharaoh that thou may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of and Moses said to God who am [Music] I that I I I should go to pharaoh who am I that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt meaning meaning this man is now shocked that God actually thought that he can actually do this oh my let me tell you the way to know God is calling you into any Ministry it will never be obvious it will shock you it will surprise you it will be bigger than you it is not a vision until it is bigger than you let me tell you God has called you each of you each of us to accomplish certain Divine assignments in this life but those Divine assignment are actually bigger than you until When God says I've called you to do this you will say God who me who am I I am but a man I have no ability I have no ability you mean me God says yes you you certain times when God shows me what he called me to accomplish I Marvel if I tell you all the things that God told me I will accomplish in this life in his service you will think I'm crazy but let me tell you each of us should come at that place where you realize what you are called to accomplish when you see it you won't believe it mes saw it said God who am me me go to PHA tell him let my people go who am I I'm nothing I'm about just a man what can I accomplish on my own do you see the difference now between the first Moses and the second Moses Exodus 41 and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me no hecken unto my voice for they will say the Lord has not appeared unto at another place he said oh God I st how will I speak when God calls you he knows you will accomplish that Divine assignment but God cannot call you until you are ready and you are not ready until you think you are not ready am I preaching to someone here this morning you are not ready until you think you are not ready if you feel you are ready you are not ready if you feel you can do it you are not ready if you want to go you are not ready but until you come to that place where you feel you are not ready then you are ready to go amen some of you are fearing marriage because you feel you are not ready I tell you then you are ready then you are ready if you feel you not worthy then you are worthy if you feel you can't serve God then you are ready if you feel you can't go then you can why because God has a way of turning weakness perfect weakness into perfect strength amen if you see every man of God that has been used by God they will tell you I never knew that God would do this like they were surprised by God hallelujah hallelujah and some of you are are even saying I can't worship God because I'm a sinner then you are ready to worship God the moment you feel so holy you can never worship God but when you are broken when you feel sinful when you feel insufficient when you feel and you are ready to worship because when you worship it will be from your heart when you are weak when you feel not loved that's the moment to worship that woman she was a prostitute when she came to Jesus she was broken she was broken she just fell down and you know everything was automatic and natural and her tears came down and she was crying why because she was broken because she knew she was not worthy brother listen sister listen when you are not worthy then you are ready to worship when you are weak then you are ready to be used by God because God wants to use useless things he wants to use useless things so that he can prove that he can never share his glory with no man amen and then he comes in our generation and he picks a man called William BR a man who had no education a man who didn't know how to speak English a man whose family was broken his parents were making out he was from a family that didn't even know God why did God do that just at an very early age of seven years he comes and speaks to him and he says never drink never def your body in any way because I have a work for you when you get older why God do that why did he pick somebody who was a nobody because God wanted to prove he can turn somebody in nobody into somebody God wanted to prove a point it is not about this it's about the go so when you see anything good in me I can announce to you this morning it's not because I am good it's not because I'm educated because God has made me what I am I am but a man God has made me who I am and that that is what he wants to make you stop feeling sorry about yourself and you fail to serve God you fail to serve God because you say you a bad story God wants bad stories God wants those ones who are really weak God is looking for nobody God is looking for somebody who can achieve nothing I don't know if I have some in the church don't worry if you have something if you feel you something this service is not for you this service is for somebody who feels their nothing why because God is just getting ready Amen to speak to you and to tell you like he spoke to Moses I have come I have come because I want you to go to pharaoh go to Egypt I'm giving you a commission I'm giving you an assignment God was giving Moses a job when Moses was not having the job qualification amen God does not hire because of qualification I don't know how many feel like me I am unqualified but I am the man for the job I am so weak and feeble but I'm the man for the job you are the woman for the job whatever God has assigned for you to accomplish you are qualified because he has called you when you apply for jobs they say you apply we will call you we will call you we will call you and they never call you because you're are not qualified but God Amen am amen he doesn't even wait for you to apply he calls you he calls you before you apply he calls you before you apply and then he says to you because you are not qualified that is the qualification hallelujah hallelujah because you're not qualified that is the qualification I know I have many people here who are not qualified for another level who are not qualified for a job who are not qualified for marriage who are not qualified for a new house for land for whatever it is because you are not qualified God has said you are qualified hallelujah hallelujah yes sir that is our God Amen when you are feeling weak and unable then he says time for me to move he waited for Moses for how many years for how many years sister 40 years why he waited for the first year mother still F qualified second year 10 years Moses was still feeling qualified and then he waited for him to marry was still jumping up jumping up and there feeling is still handsome and then he went to this he gets this Ethiopian girl he mares her God Is Watching God is saying you still have qualifications but I have to take out all the qualifications from you that the world has given you so I can make you so I can make you something that the world can never make you attack attacking Egypt at the time was like attacking America I want you to imagine you are little nobody going to invade America who does that it is impossible but now if God can send an unqualified man to invade a country how much more small things like a job off like a desire for marriage like a desire to serve God to have the Holy Ghost this small small thing God is more than [Applause] able we as dvf are not qualified to even have a land of our own because we are so few just a little over 100 people no money no money in in big tits no in big offerings we are not like other churches that are financially qualified but I tell you what God if it is time to move Sister Mary he can give us land without us even paying a shing you can call me fool but I'm just being inspired to speak by inspiration and to tell you even for a little church Someone told me don't you see you are putting yourself High get some which is like million and use the balance to BU still young poor they don't understand how when God gives a vision the vision is bigger than you see beyond what they see you see what God sees a little old Moses this time he was old he he was a Shepherd a Shepherd is the least of the jobs anyone can do meaning he had accepted to set for faes was in that Lev fa because they fa go with what comes God came at that moment now I do not know brother sister how many are here and you at that stage when you are saying amen that moment God is swifting fixing to come and when he comes he comes swiftly is is movement is faster than sound amen he came all the way from Heaven amen and he overtook Moses and he went ahead of him and he came in a a Bush Moses who was on Earth walking he found a burning bush God saw Moses when before he was born and he he waited for that moment when Moses felt weak stupid useless finished then God said it is time for me Moses was poor mother was poor brother God said it is time to move how many years 40 years it doesn't matter how long that moment when it is impossible then God wants to prove it's time to move and he came in a burning bush and they called Moses what's that mes what's that you know when he calls you you can't even believe it why you not qualified because you're not qualif you feel useless but it doesn't matter whether you feel useless it doesn't matter if God qualifies me cany you can qualify every one of us hallelujah amen and when God no one can unify and Moses at that moment he did not know he was meeting a living God friends do we believe that God is still living to or are we just having church still living God qualifies the unqualified and then he takes them on the next phase and that next phase is not a face of feess is not a pH of un qualification a of power amen amen when Moses went to Egypt he did not go as a weak man he went with us the Lord he was like a boy jumping up and down jumping up and down fearing no man Fearless when you know you are called by God you become Fearless brother that job that you want that job that you want you can receive fearlessly when you hear the calling of God it's not man to qualify you for the job amen others who have qualifications and they don't have good jobs God can qualify I don't know whether I'm preaching to someone here today when you feel no one will believe you when you feel no one will listen to you when you feel that you know no one will understand you like Moses felt amen he felt that he was just a person human being and nobody and that's why even here later on he was very busy crying when people when God brought him into this position of power and then he he felt that people were asking for too much you know you have you feel you have a lot of responsibility on your shoulders but you do not have ability to fulfill those resp responsibilities and um he started crying out he wept with all you know he had as people were crying out every man in his house and the Ang of the Lord was kind of and was also displeased yes even in the middle of your calling you can be displeased sometimes because you do not understand how this job you received when you were unqualified you cannot be able to accomplish we don't always have all the answers but the only thing we did is we answer the call and we took the job offer and Moses is very busy working and then the people begin crying and he was displeased and he said to the Lord why have you Afflicted your why why have you put all the burden of these people on did I
