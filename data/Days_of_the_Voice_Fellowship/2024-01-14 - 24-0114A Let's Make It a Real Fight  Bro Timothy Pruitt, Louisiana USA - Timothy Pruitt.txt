enemy amen he came here chasing you you go home chasing him amen remember we're not on a picnic but we are in a battlefield amen many people they think when they become Christians that's just all there is to it life is going to be easy no more mind battles no more problems don't ever get that in your head I became a Christian to fight Amen to fight the good fight of faith I became a Christian to get in the battle amen we are Christian Soldiers we have been trained we have been brought up to know the techniques of the enemy and how to fortify ourselves and to know how to fight a good fight amen last night as I was speaking to you I was telling you it was your time this is your Jubilee I want you to understand this fight is not just a fight for preachers or song leaders or musicians but we all must fight this good fight of Faith amen I wanted you to understand this was not just a jubilee for preachers but it was your Jubilee it's not just my hands that can be laid upon the sick but your hands can cast out Devils you have been called into this place to cast him out when you see the devil arise you cast him down amen we are Christian Soldiers amen we have been called to a battle but we have the Holy Spirit to direct us we have the chief commanding officer brother brandom said this he said I anything I hate to see is a spineless person who calls himself a Christian he said God wants somebody with some grit with a backbone that'll fight that won't just lay over for the devil and let him run all over you but you'll pull your sword and you'll fight you'll take your inheritance you'll take what God has given you you'll take it all it was an old brother by the name of Buddy Robinson he said Lord give me the backbone the size of a of a log and let me fight the devil as long as I got it one two and he said when all my teeth are gone let me gum him till I die Hallelujah that's what I like you got to be determined I'm going to break these Cycles I'm going to break my my Heritage that was handed down from a generation after generation I am determin to live right I am determined to act right I am determined to walk right I am determined to talk right I am determined because God is Place something on the [Applause] inside God give you the Holy Ghost how many's got the Holy Ghost well there's a determination that comes with it he said when you get that determination get ready you're about to take over hallelujah hallelujah amen get ready you about to take over cuz I said so no God said so let's go take over that's what God wants us to do come on now some of you young people need to go home and take over your bedrooms take over your car take over your private life amen take over your cell phone take over everything the devil is trying to hinder you and put him under your feet hallelujah hallelujah amen that is what we are commissioned to do we are not commissioned to be the slave for some Spirit or the slave for some devil we are commissioned as the Church of the Living God to rise above every Spirit to rise above every devil and put him where he belongs under [Applause] ouru hallelujah amen amenu Joshua and Caleb they went into to spy out the land there was two of them that came back with a good report and 10 with a bad report the 10 come back and said we look like grasshoppers we we know what you have grasshoppers oh yeah I know I know you have grasshoppers cuz 30 years ago I watched people eat grasshoppers we eat them amen that was that that was not out somewhere somewhere Yonder that was in kapala that's right I know you got grasshoppers but who told them that who gave them the idea could you I I don't imagine it was like this Mr giant what do I look like oh a grasshopper that's what I thought no it was in their mind they looked at their problems and made their problems bigger than their car they looked at the walls of Jericho and made them bigger than their car amen but not Joshua and Caleb they said we can do it this is our promise this is our inheritance this is what God has given me and how dare any devil stand in my way God promised we could have it he promised we could have the Holy Ghost he promised we could have healing he promised we could have Deliverance he promised it I'll take it it is our land it belongs to us but see when you quit looking at the Giants and you start looking at the word of God you will take over Hallelujah walls can look really big when you're standing down here but our position has been changed we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so you're not looking up at the walls you're looking down at the walls Hallelujah you're not looking up at that child you're looking down at that child Hallelujah hallu thank I'm a country boy I don't live I don't live in big cities with high buildings exactly I live in the country country I went to Cape Town South Africa and I was walking down some of these streets and I was looking at some of the taller buildings like wow you know later that evening the brother took us up on top of a building and we sat down and had a meal on a rotating restaurant now I was looking down on the building few days later I go up on Table Rock and I look and I'm looking down there's the restaurant there's the building oh wow this is a high place a few days later I got an airplane and I went over the top of Table Rock what I'm trying to tell you if your enemy is looking big just come up a little higher hallah if your enemy is looking too impossible just rise up a little high Hallelujah we are astronauts we are called for another dimension astronauts are looking at Earth say how small it is yes W meanwhile on Earth people are having trials people are going through sicknesses people are dying but astronauts see a little bit OPP Hallelujah in this service we're going to magnify how big our God is and how small your enemy really is he's nothing but a bluff when men and women quit looking at the sickness and the disease and they start looking at what God said about you'll take over all things how many can say all all things are subject to Jesus Christ all things are subject to you when you pray you ask in my name and believe it shall be [Applause] done God makes big things very very simple God in Simplicity he takes big diseases that that doctors gives a name this long and he puts them in three letters a l l All That's how little your the enemy that is against you is he said I am the Lord God that heals all all all that is Jesus I am the Lord God That Forgives [Music] your now all your diseases all your sin all your iniquity he has put under his feet you say well I I just don't feel like very much brother Timothy are you part of the body of Christ how many is part of the body of Christ well in Revelations 10 I saw a mighty Angel come down and he put one foot upon the land and one foot upon the sea he was showing he had dominion over it all amen so I don't care what part of the body you are if you're the skin on the bottom of the foot the lowest of the lowest of the lowest but when that foot goes down every devil is under you I'm the weakest of Christians every devil is under you let me just say this real quick all the part of the body is important the Unseen and the seen actually the Unseen is more important many times the seen you can cut a finger off and live and still live you can lose your arm and still live what happens if something on the inside like your heart or your liver or something of vital importance then the whole body dies he said we are one body jointly fit together we are all important amen not I'm not just so I'm not important because I come from a different country that has nothing to do with it I'm part of a body that body is Jesus Christ and we are everyone important amen hallelujah one day there was a bunch of Israelites gathered on a Hillside and there was this big old giant his name was Goliath you know when when you say the devil's like this when he gets a edge on you that's when he thinks he has you he walked out about 10 foot tall tall big armor and spear said I'll tell you what what I'll do I'll make an agreement with you send me a man to fight me and if he if he if I win then you serve us if your man wins then we'll serve you lying devil ly devil listen the devil never keeps one of his deals he said well I don't know if I can be a Christian I don't know if I can be a Christian because I hear Christians have to give 10% to the work of God so I don't know if I can afford that well let me tell you the devil takes more than 10% oh yeah I know I used to serve him too I know he takes a lot I wasn't always a Christian I didn't always serve the Lord but thank God it changed my life but I found out God gives more than he takes Hallelujah he'll give you back more than you can ever give to [Music] him amen yes Hallelujah that went pretty good for about 40 days Giant Goliath message but one day brother brandham said there was a different set of ears in the camp hallelujah hallelujah he went good for 40 days when he he can make his challeng he could go in back in and then Philistine women would give a massage calm his hair and feed him grapes and he could lean back and he could say I'm the man but on this day there was a different set of ears in the camp and Goliath got up that morning he didn't know it but it was his last morning he ate his breakfast probably had about 12 pancakes three dozen of eggs five cups of coffee it was his last breakfast he put on his armor it was his last time to put his armor on he walked out of his tent and he made his boast it was the last time he was going to make that boast cuz there was a little David in the camp Hallelujah and David heard him he said who is this uncircumcised phis how dare he how dare he challenge the army of the Living God I'll fight him David wasn't a fighter he was a Shepherd sure he had a sling that would kill a lion he he he could kill a bear but you know the real secret behind David's courage he had the anointing all poured on him Hallelujah he knew he was next and line to be king and there was no devil going to stand in my way hello bride of Jesus Christ you're not some little nothing you're not some nobody you're in line to be the Queen of Heaven the anointing all has been poured over you so don't let no giant stand in your way rise up a little higher rise up a little higher Saul said okay let let me put my quotes on you let me let me put what I believe on you David said this don't fit me It Don't Fit who I am and he began to testify what God had done for him how he killed the lion how he killed the bear and he said that giant will be just as them Hallelujah and he started walking down into the valley I've been in this Valley there in Israel I've been in the valley there stood right there in that same Little Creek and I picked up some rock you know what I realized the promise was already there all it needed was somebody to pick it up hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen I invite you down into a valley the promis is already there all is waiting on is somebody that take the challenge of the enemy and pick up a stone and say today your head's coming off amen we know the story the Bible said David ran not ran away he ran to the Giants and he slung a stone and this Stone hit that giant right there and he stumbled and he stumbled and he fell but David wasn't done he went and got the sword of Goliath and he lifted it up so that all of Israel could see my God is an awesome God my God is a great God and he took his head off then he grabbed that head of that child and he lifted it up hallelujah hallelujah oh let's lift the head of Giants tonight let's lift up the head of fear let's lift up the head of depression let's lift up the head of anxiety let's lift up the head of sexual problems Hallelujah I was in Israel and they took us to the place called The the skull the the mountain of the skull where Jesus died and the god begin to tell us he said when David fought Goliath he said he brought him to this same place and he stuck a spear in the ground and he stuck his head on top of that spear because it it was at a major crossroads he wanted all of Israel to know your enemy is dead and I thought oh the son of David came to the same Crossroad and he was hung on the cross and he said these words it is finished day Hallelujah it is finished day and it showed you your enemy has no power he's just a blood for hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he's given you the same abilities to overcome as the same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead also dwells in our mortal body hallelujah hallelujah he says put your faith in action turn it loose and the Holy Ghost will come upon you he said A man was telling me the other night he had a dream and he dreamed the devil was a little bitty devil but after a while the devil said boo and he jumped back he got smaller and the devil got bigger and he went The Devil Went Boo and he jumped back he got smaller and the devil got bigger he said but all he wants the next time he jumped back he hear a Bible and he pulled it out and he looked at that devil and he said boo he got bigger and the devil got smaller boo he got bigger and the devil got smaller amen it's time to tell your enemy I am not your child I am not your son I am not your daughter I am a blood bought son of the Living [Applause] God hallu Hallelujah am prophet of God would say this the prophet would say this he said I want to speak to you something to Enlighten you to the promise of God for this age this is in Satan's Eden and 6 five he said not something for another day but for this day he said I want to bring something to your mind that would Enlighten you I think that's a good thing we ought to pay attention because it's for this day he said I want to make you a better soldier in the field you're fighting now to learn the tactics of the enemy so you can block him before he gets to you he said that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can hallelujah hallelujah you know there was a there was a boxer his name I believe was Muhammad and he he he had this uh way of boxing he would lean on the ropes and he would take punches and hold and he would just he would let his his enemy just fly and he just back there blocking leaning up Ro until his until his enemy got tired then when he got tired he came off the Roop he was fighting in a championship ship round for the championship belt and the plan was for six rounds he would stay on the ropes but in the seventh round he's going to come off the ropes and he came off the ropes and he knocked his enemy out Hallelujah this bride has been on the ropes for 6,000 years six Church agents trying to breing it off but it's the seventh round it's time to come off the road it's time to take the fight to your enemy it's time for you to quit being the tormented and become the Tormentor cuz there's going to be a people on on this Earth that's going to torment Pharaoh's Kingdom they're going to give him such a hard time he's not they're not listening to what he says huj they're not doing what he does and he's going to get tired of them and say get out of here leave my Egypt get out of here there's a people on this earth that is going to torment to devil and torment to devil until he says get out of here get out of [Applause] here are you ready to go I said are you ready to go [Applause] Hallelujah we all have mind battles that's the B greatest battle ever fought you know your Prophet had mind battles oh yeah he had mind battles amen I'll tell you a few of them he said I was listening one morning to the broadcast on the radio and it wanted to tell that creation came together by two little particles coming together and Satan started try to punch at me and he tried to not only tell me that creation wasn't real but the Bible wasn't real and that Jesus wasn't real you know he was just a man that lived like Billy Graham or all Roberts yeah he was a great man but then after a while he BEC so great that he became a God to the and it scattered all over the world since he's dead and that's all there is to it that's Satan speaking to the prophet's mind and he said I thought this Satan how a liar you are you've been talking to my conscience he said but I want to ask you a few things who was it the Hebrew Prophet spoke about that would be the anointed Messiah that would come 2000 years ago and it was foretold by the letter that he would come and he would live and he would die and he did that just exactly as it was said it was written in the word and every word is true then he [Music] left you want the devil to leave take him back to the word it is written is Proverbs 18:21 says let me say this first a thought is just a thought unless you have let it become words and then those words become power amen as long as there's a thought you just cast it down but when you begin to speak it that means you begin to believe what you're thinking Proverbs 18:21 it says death and life are in the power of the tongue amen how many's got death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof Matthew 12:3 7 says by thy words thou are Justified and by thy words Thou Art condemned lot of power in what we say Amen Hebrews 4:14 says seeing then we have a great high priest that's passed into the the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession Hebrews 10:23 says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise the Bible also says a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways Proverbs 19 says verse 14 says let the words of thy mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord 141 and verse three Psalm 141 and verse3 set a watch oh Lord before my mouth keep the doors of my lips amen you know probably not in Uganda but in you the us we have a lot of people who speak before they think oh yeah I know in Uganda too we're all humans we say [Music] things wish I wouldn't have said that Proverbs 133 he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life wo he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction right hey don't get mad at me it's the Bible you know we have a I don't know if this translates we have a saying it says I want to give him a piece of my mind sooner or later if you give out too many pieces you won't have any pieces left amen I just can't wait to tell so and so why don't you just wait a minute and pray about it and let God deal with your heart and their heart oh it's got quiet here now boy where's all the rejoicing at [Music] hallelujah it's getting [Music] deeper you know how it is sometimes I'll just tell you personal things maybe it's not like this in Uganda but you you know if you have some something happen between you and another brother you start thinking in your mind I need to talk to him so I'm going to say this and he's going to say that he better not say that cuz if he does I'm going to say this and he oh he better not say that I'm going to say this we're having some home cooking tonight but you get to the brother and you start talking to him and he don't even know what you're talking about it was all in your mind we have to cast down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself above the word of God Amen questions and answers brother brandom has asked this question please explain how a person knows if he's thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong especially if you know you don't want to think them very simple if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's Tak it if it's with the word it's God's if it's the wrong thoughts it's the devil if it's good thoughts of the word and of God it's God's thinking hello somebody did you not did you notice who he left out you he said the devil he said God but the devil wants to come put thoughts in your mind and make you and make you think it's your thoughts when it's his thoughts but if it's contrary to the word of God it's not your thinking it's the devil's thinking but if it's susceptible to the word of God it's God's [Music] here's another question in the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it be that I can overcome it or get rid of it he says go the opposite direction if you know you're a Christian and the devil tries to make you think you're not a Christian you say I am a Christian I am a Christian the man the man the man continues with question he said when you answer this please pray for me to overcome I know I'm not by myself brother brandham says God grant your overcoming whoever you are may your thoughts go to the right place I am a Christian I am a believer Satan you have no hold on me now listen to this he says frankly I'm standing right here saying the same [Music] thing to keep from figing here in the pull pit CU he was battling the same thoughts the prophet had those kind of thoughts he was human hey the the the the devil appeared in his room one morning and he began to speak to him he said you have no power with God of all people to tell that to he had cast out demons after demon after demon after demon and he's standing there before him you have no power with God Satan Satan is a bluff what do we do sometimes you're right you're right devil I don't have no power fill my muscles brother I ain't got did the prophet respond to him Satan you are an offense to me get out of here in the name of Jesus CHR and he said he left and he said after he left the most precious presence came into the room and this words begin to speak the never failing presence of almighty God is with you wherever you may go I feel that same presence right now he is with you I won't always be with you brother David can't always be with you but Jesus Christ can go with you wherever you may go hallelujah hallelujah Philippians 4:8 says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest soever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise seek on these [Music] things brother Brandon would say don't ever have a negative testimony he said if God reveals to your heart and speaks to you and gives you Deliverance only have the testimony I am delivered he said because if you start testifying to the other side the negative then it'll come back worse than ever let the weak say I am strong I am strong I am healed I am delivered I am set free it is done it is finished it is [Music] overwhel he said say it to you actually believe it say it to you believe it don't have a negative testimony well I still feel bad I still feel bad I still feel down I still feel bound no I don't have that kind of testim I am a Christian I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I've been Blood Bought I've been paid for my dead is paid amen he say well I I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're talking his language then uhhuh oh we want to talk English and we don't to talk Ugandan we want to talk Kenyan but let's don't learn hell's language amen you must never say that you must never say that don't ever let your testimony be negative let it be positive I'm saved I have God in my heart I am a believer I belong to Jesus hallu Jesus is mine yes Hallelujah he's mine no matter where I go no wonder where I am he is mine and I am his hallelujah amen your body will obey your confession amen am well brother Timothy I have thoughts what I do about them cast them down go back to the word that's what Jesus did Satan came to him in his weak moment if if thou be the Son of God then turn these stones into bread he said Satan it is written he took him back to the word of God brother Brandon would say it's like this he said you can't keep thoughts coming through your mind but you can keep them from staying there he said it said it's like a farmer said he said I can't keep a bird from flying over my head but I'm sure not going to let him build a nest in there all right let's go to the spiritual side there's a lot of

she was we didn't know what would happen and I had some meetings to go to Just Like These and my father said we're at a Red Sea moment we either going to back up or we going to speak and go forward amen so we we went on I went to the meetings while I was at brother Ron Spencer I was preaching on these words the god that answers the god that answers and I would preach I was preaching on God brother Brandon speaks about it he says God answers he said God always answers but many times it's in an unexpected way and an unexpected place and an unexpected he said but the deal is you have to recognize God answered I was coming down to the end of that service and I'd walked away from my iPad here that I keep my notes on and it had went dark and I was standing in the front of the I was speaking about the three Hebrew children how that they were going into the fire we won't we'll save time here but but how God looked over and brother Bram said he caught the East Wind and the West Wind and the light and as as they stepped into the fire the fourth man came down it takes a fire to produce a Fourth Man all of a sudden I hear somebody speaking at the pull pit and I didn't have a watch at that time that would operate operate my iPad but brother Ron sitting behind us he saw my iPad light up and it goes flipping through the icons it pulls up the message goes down with the messages picks a tape picks a tape and I hear this voice said my favorite of all the hymns said Booth cin wrote it in a cornfield Booth cber name name of yeah wrote it in a cornfeld he said but it's my favorite of the hymns he said because it expresses the extreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ especially in the day that we're living in he said people want to make him just a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was God Amen and it was booming all over the audience out of my iPad and I just looked at it for a moment went back off and I got to looking at what song he was referring to it

wouldn't speak you could tell maybe she recognized you a little bit she wouldn't say any words for about 20s something hours she had not spoken a word to anybody I walked into her hospital room I looked at her brother bus I said I said mom look at me I said I want to let you know God's in the fire she turned and looked at me and she started singing down from his glory ever living story my God

your testimony is still in the making and you can have your testimony just in the next few moments right now God has told [Music] you God has told you God has told you you can only be forgiven you can only be forgiven as much as you forgive and when the preacher spoke that the Holy Spirit instructed me at that moment to speak to you anyone who is under the sound of my voice maybe you've been dropping with a burden of forgiveness and you are bitter maybe because you were hot and your heart broken and you pray but your prayers are not answered because of that burden but if you can allow the Holy Spirit to melt your heart now and say Lord forgive and you make a resolution to walk out of this meeting and go and ask that person to forgive you they don't need to ask for forgiveness from you with this sweet spirit of God moving down on your heart all the bitterness will be behind and you and the love of God that passes all understanding will come and cool over your heart and give you peace and joy unspeakable and full of Glory But first you must forgive I wonder how many here are caring that burden I don't care where you are from you may be from Congo or from Kenya or from Zimbabwe or from right here in Uganda or from any other country that is represented here I speak to you in the name of Jesus Christ let that burden of unforgiveness leave you right now be filled with the love of God forgive your enemies I instruct you to do that right now forgive your enemy God will take your Brokenness and M character you are losing your mind because of this burden and you're fighting a battle you don't even know what you're F I know God is dealing with someone here you don't have to leave these meetings the way you came you are a good person but if you allow this burden to weigh you down you will never come to a place of Victory but think about it if you can let go and let God come in you will be free you'll be full of joy love you will leave this meeting and as we heard the Devil will think you are the person that left but he will realize you're a different one some of you are going back to clean up your rooms you're going you you're going back home to clean

instead to come in place of the ministers I had invited um and uh well you're going to to hear about this but first hear what I'm telling you and so I spoke to brother Timothy and I told him my desire that I had on my heart for them to come and also to Brother David and brother they had some other schedules they had prepared I think you had meetings I don't know May in Canada on this same weekend

came to minister to us lastly oh thank you brother Prince please come lastly I wanted to say I appreciate and salute Pastor wickliff W from Nairobi sent us such a big number of young people 33 of them stand up the video man you're supposed to show them not me all these ones you see all these let us give another hand which is bigger God bless you so much thank you for coming but I'm warning you next time come bigger like bigger than this you told me you going to come bigger two have already left their Patron brother Isaac ISAC uh for some reason he had to to drive back with another appr and so we also have brother Prince but Prince has quite a testimony and we got connected in Zimbabwe you know he was born in the message and then left went into the world and then came back so I found him when he was back but you know still struggling and questioning whether not to go to Ministry but while we ministering together he actually intered one service and then they gave me another interpreter I I told Pastor side why is that young man that interpreted for me said that one there but Pastor was like that is there when the pastor does that you know that issue but he said that one is running away from Ministry I said I want him can we go with him to and my we had quite an experience didn't we and and and uh ever since we've been connected and from after those meetings he took to the streets God Le a fire in him I was told 15 people have already been baptized from the streets and I'm so glad for him to be here and I asked P I said would you like him to come he said you representing an entire nation you have to stand here God bless you I greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ the prophet one time in a vision said I saw black hands lifted up and I'm glad and I believe and I'm glad and I believe that amongst those hands with my very black hands like the Pastor said I was born in the message but the message was not born in me so along the lines you know the devil plays tricks on you because because you're not yet grounded in the message so when the pastor was preaching he was talking about me right there and his testimony is exactly like my testimony but God is gracious and kind and merciful the prophet says we were in God's mind before the foundations of the world and if God would lose me that would mean God has lost his mind of which God can never lose his mind my name is brother Prince but one day but one day I just had an inspiration somewhere I told myself I love the name g did I know little did I know that when I was born my father actually wanted to give me that name but he did not know what it meant Pastor so I gave myself that name and I had to go and tell the meaning of it it means gentleman and I believe that I'm one of the very few gentlemen left in this world Amen so I like to thank my pastor Pastor you know forgive me Pastor for taking much of your time you know God sends an answer every time when you need him I was I was going I was going you know in my mind I had one thought that was telling me that something you know you have that feeling but one part of me was looking at where I have and I felt so ashamed so when he came I was actually conflicting in my mind then I was on the pulpit asking God after that he came to me after the service he said young man you preach I took it as a question and I said no because I was running he corrected me and said I am not asking you I am telling you then the the way that it began one day after all night I was sleeping thinking out of the blue a friend of mine sends me a testimony by Pastor per green where he wanted to move from one city to another and he was conflicting in his mind and as the prophet about how do I know the will of God in my life you know that short clip came to me at the time when I was thinking of it but still I ran until one day I was sitting in a Combi TX back home we call them combies yeah you call them taxi taxi and God sent a drunkard holding a beer bottle in a comie sitting in front of me him he started preaching to me Holy Ghost convicted me said you are running and now look at you a drunker with a bottle of Castle ler is preaching to you in a if you want to run continue to run but somewhere along the line my story and that's the reason why I'm here all thanks to Pastor tal I love you so much I love you so much from the bottommost part of my heart if been for him I would have never gotten on a plane it's actually my first time getting on a plane from thank you so much amen amen am Pastor Gideon if you want I'll send him to your church and he will preach you will see song few times and we were all on fire so it's going to be around for up to the end of the month and so I would like also to appreciate Pastor a good friend and Elder who sent also a good size to the meetings can you all stand from again okay behind here and over this side any other brother you are not standing okay God bless you so much thank you for coming we appreciate you so I see this sister when I was preaching there I was giving us an example oh I now see you God bless you nice to see you hallelujah amen we've had a wonderful time now we've reached the end of our preaching meetings and so we are going to dismiss go for supper while they're setting up the the sound at the uh fireplace after which we shall go there for the testimony service which will also be streamed we intend to do that we've not tested it but we intend to do that so the Lord bless you I don't even want to dismiss you it's been a sweet Fellowship I know some of you I'm not going to come there so I have to say this we're looking forward to 2025 January how many are looking forward amen 100% is looking forward amen and we don't know what God has in store for us but someone lost 3,000 if you unless you want to give it as an offering you should come for it and my last testimony as we go someone lost this phone there is a man standing right there brother lumu come come up here yeah this brother is from pastor bu's church one of the most serious deons I've ever seen so Hallelujah people appreciate you [Music] huh so in our first Youth Camp he came and he helped us greatly in this one he told me he's coming and then they called him somewhere else he told they told them I'm s I'm booked so he came so we say God bless you brother we appreciate you I forgot that other Pastor there is there Pastor are you a pastor can you please bless you Saints I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ my name I from but I've come with I wasn't told of this meeting I didn't know of it but I was with brother Gideon in some Ministry and we went together in K we've been together at his church the one who has told me for me it was way beyond my thinking sorry Mr very brother because also you know me but we weren't able to connect that's why I wasn't informed of this meeting but I thank God but that in his for know he knew that I would get the same blessing you've got here even though you came here before me but when it comes the time of of giving out the Saturday we shall all be given the those who came here before me I might have got something precious that's why God prepared me to come here I still appreciate the ministers those that have come from Beyond we appreciate you for coming here thanks for hting I pray that we continue being connected because I want to be part of every Ministry that goes on the Lord bless you happy to see brother all in the name of our Lord Jesus CHR God bless you uh I forgot one person and

something in the next youth meetings we are going to arrange I'm requesting you to please register and also contribute we should learn to take care of our meetings we are a new generation if we don't learn it we shall our children shall not learn it how many say Amen to that amen and so I I I heard when I give those words there is someone who was delivered now came and gave a testimony and you see this idea and spirit of begging we are not Beggars friends are we are we are we poor are you poor we are not poor tell me have you ever seen any man with God poor unless you do not know what true riches are but we are not even talking about just two riches we are talking also about substance that we can resources that we can use for the ministry our God is more than enough and our brothers as usual I told you that I do not ask them to support to give to find our meetings want them to come and just uh blessed us with their Ministry and they have blessed us with their Ministry and for that we are so thankful to and so we took up an offering and uh you know when we went for that break we needed to pay 2.9 Million sh which was remaining now that sounded awfully much when I mentioned it
