[36:16] Bible uh please buy
[36:19] one if you can't buy one come see

[36:34] [Music]
[36:37] careless it also means when you go back
[36:39] home you don't read the
[36:43] Bible a Christian should read the Bible
[36:46] every
[36:48] day your Bible is your
[36:51] gun you don't let it

[37:32] not be say that my Bible was
[37:39] Sten Genesis 6 verse
[37:43] 5 we are reading up to verse
[37:48] 8 and God saw that the wickedness of man
[37:52] was great in the earth and that every
[37:54] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[37:56] was only evil continually and it
[37:59] repented the Lord that he had made man
[38:01] on Earth on the earth and it grieved him
[38:04] at his heart and the Lord said I will
[38:06] destroy man whom I have created from the
[38:08] face of the Earth both man and Beast and
[38:12] the creeping thing and the fs of the air
[38:14] for it repenteth me that I have made
[38:17] them but Noah found Grace in the sight
[38:20] of the Lord Brother shame my sound is
[38:23] not yet good my monitors I can't hear
[38:26] myself for
[38:33] [Music]

[39:06] Lord let us
[39:08] pray kind Heavenly
[39:10] Father we humble our before

[39:16] purchase of

[39:22] brother who is
[39:24] intere because we are useless and
[39:27] powered
[39:29] without you we are
[39:32] weak we are
[39:35] insufficient we are seen as saved by
[39:38] gra but Lord if you please this
[39:42] evening and if we have found favor
[39:44] before your
[39:46] sight I pray that you will help us and
[39:48] use
[39:49] us the benefit of your
[39:52] children both those that are here and
[39:55] those that are streaming the service now
[39:58] and those that shall hear this service
[40:00] later may your presence Lord be
[40:04] made I pray in Jesus name amen be
[40:12] seated so I'm speaking this
[40:16] evening on finding Grace in the eyes of
[40:23] God so now the Bible begins here on
[40:26] verse five
[40:31] by um saying that God saw the wickedness
[40:35] of
[40:38] man was great in the
[40:41] earth and that every imagination of
[40:46] thoughts of his
[40:48] heart Contin now remember here we
[40:52] speaking about the time before the flood
[40:57] and so this was before the time that God
[41:00] had destroyed the world with
[41:03] water and this is the reason why
[41:05] actually God decided to destroy the
[41:07] world with
[41:12] water the people's hearts were
[41:16] darkened man had become more and more
[41:20] wicked and to the to the place where the
[41:23] scripture now would say that every
[41:25] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[41:28] was only evil
[41:34] continu now do do you know that we as
[41:38] the end time
[41:40] church and really I'm not preaching but
[41:43] I'm speaking to
[41:45] you I want to be looking at you and I
[41:47] want you to be looking
[41:49] at and I not Con on those who are online
[41:52] I'm concentrating on those of you who
[41:53] are
[41:56] here and I want you to imagine
[41:59] this that the Bible if if God himself
[42:02] the holy
[42:04] God gracious
[42:06] God God would come to a place where he
[42:10] would not
[42:11] judge and he would say man is
[42:16] wicked and and then he says that that
[42:19] every imagination of
[42:24] man's was now evil
[42:28] did you know that we have arrived at the
[42:29] same same
[42:32] time where man is
[42:35] wicked where the imaginations of people
[42:37] today are continually evil
[42:42] before and I'm not even talking about
[42:45] people out
[42:46] there I'm talking about people in
[42:49] here what I want you to ask
[42:53] yourself how is the imaginations of your
[42:55] heart every day
[42:59] what did you imagine just take inventory
[43:02] of your own
[43:04] life how were your imaginations from
[43:07] morning up to
[43:10] now how much of the time today did you
[43:13] take thinking about the
[43:16] Lord thinking about the word of
[43:19] goding about the coming
[43:22] of how much time did you
[43:25] spend did you know that God would speak
[43:28] to a prophet in this
[43:31] day and and he told him that tell
[43:35] them that their
[43:37] thoughts are louder in heaven than their
[43:42] what our thoughts before
[43:45] God are much louder than our
[43:51] words God doesn't hear our
[43:53] words because our thoughts supersede our
[43:58] [Music]
[44:00] he says that the imaginations of the
[44:03] people
[44:07] Contin not only one time not only one
[44:11] day but
[44:14] Contin their thought were
[44:17] evil praise the name of the Lord I'm I'm
[44:20] sorry I uh the monitors are not only not
[44:24] bringing the good sound but also there's
[44:26] a big Echo so you really have to help us
[44:29] work on the sound for for for for for a
[44:32] smooth flow of the the
[44:36] ministry sometimes the sound is really
[44:38] perfect sometimes it is very poor like
[44:42] today praise the name of the
[44:45] Lord and so I would like you
[44:48] to um follow closely with me here
[44:58] there's this word here which says
[45:02] continu every imagination of the
[45:05] thoughts of his heart was only now that
[45:09] other word
[45:14] [Music]
[45:16] only only
[45:20] evil if I would to if I was to pick one
[45:23] of
[45:25] you and put them here and put a
[45:31] screen and take the imaginations you had
[45:35] today on the screen for all to
[45:39] see how many would want to
[45:45] volunteer I want to be the
[45:47] one for my imaginations to be
[45:53] dis no one is willing to volunteer
[45:59] you see we are back again in the days of
[46:05] no the thoughts of the people's
[46:09] hearts are continually
[46:14] evil if you call yourselves
[46:18] Believers are not willing to volunteer
[46:20] to display your thoughts before
[46:24] everyone how much more those who are in
[46:27] the
[46:29] world you see how bad it has
[46:34] become and the scripture
[46:36] says and it repented
[46:39] God that he had made man on the
[46:43] earth and G him at his
[46:46] heart I believe when God looks at our
[46:48] thoughts he gets
[46:51] grieved when he sees what people are
[46:53] imagining he gets G
[46:57] when he sees what is going on in the
[46:58] hearts of people he gets
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:01] grief I literally grieve God every day
[47:03] you literally grieve God every
[47:07] day and the Lord said I will now destroy
[47:11] man I have from the face of the
[47:14] Earth and and when he God became angry
[47:17] he said I not only destroy
[47:20] man but I also destroy Beast and I also
[47:24] all the creeping thing
[47:27] of the air because it repenteth me that
[47:30] I have
[47:32] made now I want you to see in the mind
[47:35] of of The Sovereign
[47:39] God how man would be in the mind of a
[47:42] sovereign
[47:45] God in the mind of a sovereign God man
[47:48] is
[47:50] unworthy man only deserves
[47:53] judgment man only deserves condemnation
[47:58] and there is only one thing that can
[47:59] save
[48:01] man amen and that is what is called
[48:04] Grace because now he came down on verse
[48:07] 8 and he said but Noah found Grace in
[48:09] the eyes of the
[48:11] [Music]
[48:13] Lord you think that Noah's imaginations
[48:16] were
[48:17] [Applause]
[48:18] good he was just like the rest
[48:22] of but the Bible says no found Grace
[48:28] in the eyes of the
[48:30] Lord now I was finding the word
[48:35] grace in Hebrew it is
[48:39] called which is to mean
[48:43] favor
[48:46] kindness you know undeserved
[48:52] favor gra is the basis of the Christian
[48:55] faith
[48:58] we are we believe we are saved by by
[49:02] faith through
[49:05] Grace now God's grace is usually defined
[49:08] as undeserved
[49:14] favor Grace in other words also is the
[49:17] power of
[49:20] God to help us
[49:24] overcome without Grace we cannot
[49:26] overcome the
[49:28] world none of us has
[49:32] righteousness let me put it this way
[49:34] none of us has the works the amount of
[49:36] works of
[49:40] righteousness that God could best on to
[49:42] take you to the
[49:45] rapt if he did if there was one then God
[49:50] did not need to send his
[49:53] son he did not need to die on the cross
[49:57] but because all
[49:59] man was
[50:02] insufficient all man was in
[50:05] sin all man was
[50:07] unworthy all man was
[50:10] undeserving God himself decided to take
[50:14] it upon
[50:15] himself amen and give something that we
[50:19] did not
[50:21] deserve and Grace is not eared
[50:26] but it is freely
[50:28] given it is God's
[50:32] prerogative to give it to whever he
[50:36] [Applause]
[50:37] will now when when God looks in the
[50:40] whole
[50:41] earth is up to him to whom he will give
[50:46] Grace you know he like like in in that
[50:50] day I'm imagining that there must have
[50:52] been thousands and tens of thousands of
[50:55] people on earth
[50:58] but among all the people who were on
[51:02] Earth God chose one am and he says amen
[51:06] he found
[51:08] Grace in the eyes of the Lord did not do
[51:12] anything to deserve that
[51:14] Grace Noah did
[51:17] nothing but Noah found
[51:20] Grace in the sight of God and of course
[51:24] his family there is something
[51:26] significant that I found in the in the
[51:30] scripture when you find Grace in the
[51:32] eyes of the
[51:34] Lord it is passed on down to your entire
[51:40] generation it is passed on to your
[51:42] children to their wives their
[51:46] children and that is why we have to
[51:48] apply the token upon
[51:51] them when when when when Noah found
[51:53] Grace in the eyes
[51:55] of that meant his sons their wife his
[51:59] wife every one of them found Grace in
[52:03] the eyes of the Lord why because of one
[52:05] man who had
[52:07] found I don't know about you
[52:10] friends but as I was going through this
[52:13] I mared at the grace I
[52:16] found in the eyes of the Lord that I did
[52:20] not do anything to deserve it as a
[52:23] matter of fact every day how I imagine
[52:27] our words our thoughts our actions take
[52:30] us further away
[52:33] from but
[52:34] Grace
[52:36] CL every of our Liv the death of Jesus
[52:41] on the
[52:42] cross what was it
[52:44] for it was to give us
[52:48] Grace everyone gets
[52:51] Grace not everyone gets
[52:54] Grace not everyone
[52:58] how many here can say I found
[53:02] Grace it's a
[53:04] revelation wait until I get I get deep
[53:06] into
[53:08] this I trust that if you came PR
[53:11] prayerfully you will enjoy what the Lord
[53:14] has for us
[53:15] tonight amen the word is just amazing
[53:18] and so
[53:20] lovely not only good to study but also
[53:23] good to
[53:25] hear so I wanted to hear this
[53:29] evening in the message of Grace which is
[53:31] a good message for us to listen to if
[53:32] you can go
[53:36] and he says the grace of God reached
[53:40] over in Noah's
[53:46] timein
[53:49] man and his
[53:51] family but because Noah feared
[53:54] God he believed
[53:57] God you cannot fear God without
[54:01] believing how can you fear something you
[54:03] don't
[54:04] believe you've got to fear God Solomon
[54:08] said the fear of God is the beginning of
[54:11] wisdom just to fear
[54:14] God you are beginning to have
[54:17] wisdom that's why the Bible says those
[54:20] people who don't believe the
[54:22] word they fools the Bible says only the
[54:25] fool say there is no
[54:29] God to those of you who believe the word
[54:32] it means you have the fear of God in
[54:34] your
[54:35] heart you believe in the existence of
[54:38] God you believe this is not
[54:41] a this is a reality and because of that
[54:45] the moment you begin to fear God you are
[54:48] beginning to have wisdom the you you
[54:51] begin to believe the word you are
[54:53] beginning to have wisdom and the fear of
[54:56] God now fear the lord and and he
[54:58] believed the
[55:00] Lord and that's what God
[55:04] honors is your faith in
[55:07] him but now remember
[55:09] Faith through
[55:11] Grace we we have believed on him by
[55:15] faith through
[55:18] Grace without Grace our faith is in
[55:24] vain all right so you see one leads to
[55:27] another and one is connected to the
[55:31] other then when the fear of the Lord
[55:33] come upon
[55:36] Noah God called him by
[55:41] Grace amen and saved him and his house
[55:46] because it was Grace that did it not
[55:50] because Noah was a great big handsome
[55:54] man that oh more than all the rest of
[55:58] them not because Noah went to the church
[56:01] to the best Church there was in the
[56:05] country not because he belonged to the
[56:07] best in
[56:10] organization not because he could dress
[56:13] better you know for us in our church we
[56:17] dress better than any other
[56:19] Church you know our women don't dress
[56:21] that
[56:24] our and that's why we are the bride
[56:27] that's a big
[56:29] mistake we are not the bride because of
[56:31] what we
[56:33] do we are not the bride because of how
[56:36] we
[56:38] look are you hearing me we are not the
[56:41] bright because of what we do not
[56:44] do what we do but we do what we do
[56:49] because we know who we
[56:50] are when you find out when you receive a
[56:54] revelation of who you
[56:57] then you do things and you stop doing
[57:01] things those things that you did all
[57:04] those things you stop doing do not make
[57:07] you who you
[57:08] are how many receive that Hallelujah and
[57:12] so we are not the
[57:14] bride because we do this or don't do
[57:20] that Noah did not find
[57:23] Grace because of he was more handsome
[57:26] he dressed better he was in a better
[57:29] Church actually they have better
[57:31] churches than
[57:33] ours I'm telling you there even
[57:36] denominations have better rules than
[57:40] ours did you know we have
[57:44] organizations that don't actually even
[57:47] believe that a man should even wear a
[57:50] [Music]
[57:52] ring because according to them that is
[57:55] jewelry
[57:57] and when you look at it it is indeed it
[58:01] is so if this is
[58:04] jewelry NE Jew it's the same thing so in
[58:08] their understanding then we should not
[58:11] wear the ring women should not wear
[58:14] necklace you know because these things
[58:17] are
[58:18] sins but did you know that now we in the
[58:21] message we we have
[58:24] levels where by now when one wears a
[58:28] necklace that one is a sinner but where
[58:31] one wears a that one is okay according
[58:34] to
[58:36] [Music]
[58:37] what are you hearing
[58:39] me but our Prophet would come and tell
[58:42] us it's the
[58:45] motive it's the motive behind what
[58:48] you're
[58:49] doing wear Rings because it
[58:53] shows it's a sign when someone would see
[58:56] me wearing a
[58:58] ring oh he's
[59:00] married it's a simp because everybody
[59:02] knows
[59:04] what and when it comes to things like a
[59:07] like a
[59:08] necklace he says okay if your husband
[59:11] lets you wear
[59:15] one it's all right I don't find problem
[59:18] but there be
[59:20] organizations and
[59:22] religions that will tell you all that is
[59:24] sin
[59:26] and where when you do all that you will
[59:28] go to
[59:29] hell so now this message has taken us a
[59:33] level
[59:35] high this message is the message of
[59:39] Grace whereby it has revealed to us the
[59:42] character of
[59:44] Christ whereby we are no longer living
[59:47] under the bondage of the
[59:50] law fear a dreadful
[59:54] God going to come and kill
[59:57] the moment we did something
[59:58] wrong no we are beyond that if you're
[1:00:02] living below that you not known what the
[1:00:08] message let me not do this because God
[1:00:11] will kill me let me do that I will go to
[1:00:14] hell I have a
[1:00:17] revelation hell is not my pure to
[1:00:20] begin it is not even in the mind of
[1:00:24] God take me to hell
[1:00:26] because hell was not made for
[1:00:29] believers hell was made for
[1:00:32] devils and his
[1:00:34] angels that is not my
[1:00:37] portion listen it is not even a portion
[1:00:40] of any
[1:00:42] believer
[1:00:44] why sometimes people want to
[1:00:47] believe the message of
[1:00:49] fear because they don't understand their
[1:00:53] God to those who know their God
[1:00:56] they know
[1:00:57] works is only
[1:01:00] done out of
[1:01:02] Revelation knowing who you
[1:01:05] are of knowing who you are before I know
[1:01:08] I am a
[1:01:10] woman I will dress like a man before I
[1:01:13] know I'm a man like a woman right when a
[1:01:18] little child like this comes
[1:01:20] up you can even give them a
[1:01:23] dress and they will wear a dress
[1:01:26] because they don't have a
[1:01:29] difference they don't know that when you
[1:01:32] when you a man you don't wear a
[1:01:36] dress but let me pick one of you
[1:01:38] brothers and give you a dress to
[1:01:45] wear I remember when I was very
[1:01:49] little now that I
[1:01:51] remember must have been even Beyond five
[1:01:53] perhaps
[1:01:56] my mother used to give me little dresses
[1:01:57] to
[1:01:58] wear and many of you brothers did
[1:02:03] wear
[1:02:05] right you don't want to say yes but
[1:02:09] you now you are ashamed because you have
[1:02:12] a
[1:02:13] revelation who you are I'm a
[1:02:18] Manar you
[1:02:20] see you know who you are when you know
[1:02:23] who you are you don't do the things the
[1:02:25] world
[1:02:26] do because you know you are a royal
[1:02:29] PR because you know you a king and a PRI
[1:02:33] you know you supposed to be different
[1:02:35] and that's why we come to church to be
[1:02:38] told who we
[1:02:39] are and the word of God is going on
[1:02:43] gives us a revelation gives us an
[1:02:46] understanding of who we
[1:02:49] are and our Prophet said the true church
[1:02:52] shall know who she is and what she
[1:02:55] stands
[1:02:56] then the devil cannot
[1:02:59] defeat but the problem is many people
[1:03:02] live in
[1:03:06] Amnesia we do not know who we are so
[1:03:09] it's none of the
[1:03:10] works that save
[1:03:13] Noah but because he gives the
[1:03:18] reason but because of the grace of
[1:03:22] God God no I repeat that but because of
[1:03:27] the grace of
[1:03:29] God God sa
[1:03:32] no gra
[1:03:35] no not his work but his
[1:03:40] grace and also saved his
[1:03:43] family hallelujah praise God hallu the
[1:03:47] same Grace that saved me will save my
[1:03:51] family you ought to say that to
[1:03:54] yourself the same that served me I serve
[1:03:58] my
[1:04:00] father everyone in
[1:04:02] my I claim the blood upon them
[1:04:06] hallelujah amen he is a powerful
[1:04:10] Grace sometimes we do not talk about
[1:04:12] Grace
[1:04:15] enough probably Noah was as bad as the
[1:04:18] people of his
[1:04:20] time family was not any
[1:04:24] better but
[1:04:30] Sav Hallelujah prise God and Grace is
[1:04:35] powerful I tell you when you find God's
[1:04:39] grace you have certain
[1:04:44] privileges that others who have not
[1:04:46] found it
[1:04:48] don't how many would like to know such
[1:04:52] privileges let's go in the Book of
[1:04:53] Genesis chapter 19
[1:04:56] first look at somebody else who found
[1:05:01] Grace amen I'm now I'm looking at Grace
[1:05:05] actually today mostly from the Old
[1:05:06] Testament rather than the old the New
[1:05:12] Testament so my version of presenting it
[1:05:15] today is
[1:05:18] different verse
[1:05:21] 17 I'm going to read up to verse
[1:05:24] 22 and it came to pass when they had
[1:05:26] found when they had brought them forth
[1:05:28] abroad that he said Escape for thy life
[1:05:31] look not behind thee neither stay thou
[1:05:34] in all the plain escape to the mountain
[1:05:37] lest thou be consumed and Lord said unto
[1:05:40] them oh not so my Lord behold now thy
[1:05:43] servant has found Grace in thy sight and
[1:05:46] thou Hast magnified thy mercy which thou
[1:05:49] has showed unto me in saving my life and
[1:05:52] I cannot escape to the mountain L some
[1:05:53] evil take me and I die behold now this
[1:05:56] city is near to flee unto and it is a
[1:05:59] little one or let me escape the is it
[1:06:01] not a little one and my soul shall leave
[1:06:04] and he said unto him see I have accepted
[1:06:06] thee concerning this thing also that I
[1:06:09] will not overthrow this city for the
[1:06:10] which thou has spoken thee ESC for I
[1:06:14] cannot do anything till thou be there
[1:06:17] the name of the city was zor you can
[1:06:24] read for
[1:07:25] Hallelujah Hallelujah I want you to see
[1:07:27] Grace today in a different
[1:07:30] way Grace when when you find Grace in
[1:07:34] the eyes of the
[1:07:37] Lord it is unmerited
[1:07:41] favor something you do not
[1:07:44] deserve but God gives it to
[1:07:47] you and once he has given
[1:07:50] it once you have found that
[1:07:53] gra you have a priv
[1:07:57] that no other
[1:07:59] has I'm going to show you a few
[1:08:02] examples people that found
[1:08:04] Grace in the sight of
[1:08:07] God before I talk about Lord I talk a
[1:08:11] little bit about
[1:08:12] Moses how the word of God would even say
[1:08:15] that you know they should marry among
[1:08:17] their
[1:08:20] own and so here is a man of God that
[1:08:24] actually went Beyond and married an
[1:08:26] Ethiopian
[1:08:29] woman and you know ab and K and together
[1:08:34] with were
[1:08:36] Justified to come against the man of
[1:08:40] God because he was out of the
[1:08:46] word and and and you know when when they
[1:08:49] they made a team among
[1:08:51] themselves they said here is what we are
[1:08:53] going to
[1:08:54] do the man has
[1:08:56] error and you know isn't there other
[1:08:58] people who are spiritual Among
[1:09:01] Us you see but what did what did Moses
[1:09:06] have follow me Clos Moses had
[1:09:10] something all these others had not
[1:09:16] re Moses had received
[1:09:20] favor
[1:09:21] Gra unmerited
[1:09:26] he had he had it and so when God came
[1:09:29] down what did he do he told
[1:09:33] them Moses it's all right that's what
[1:09:37] they doing let me finish all of
[1:09:40] them Moses had to
[1:09:44] intered if Moses did not intercede for
[1:09:47] them God would fish almost all the
[1:09:53] Israelites but he Moses stood between
[1:09:56] them the of
[1:09:59] God and and you know he told all the
[1:10:02] others who were standing against
[1:10:05] him stand on one side and you know how
[1:10:08] the story went and others were swallowed
[1:10:11] up under the the so under the
[1:10:14] soil the Earth swallowed them what was
[1:10:18] go God trying to
[1:10:20] demonstr yet Moses was not a perfect
[1:10:24] man Moses had
[1:10:26] anger Moses was was a sinner just like
[1:10:30] the rest of them you know God told him
[1:10:32] go and strike the rock
[1:10:35] once and he strike it
[1:10:37] twice Moses also
[1:10:40] disobeyed Moses married against the
[1:10:44] word are you hearing no I'm not
[1:10:47] justifying
[1:10:49] wrongdoing but this is what happened in
[1:10:52] Moses he was not worthy either
[1:10:56] his life was not
[1:10:58] worthy of the love of God but here is
[1:11:01] one thing called
[1:11:03] Grace PR is more powerful than any sin
[1:11:07] that there is in the
[1:11:08] world no matter what a man has done let
[1:11:13] them find Grace
[1:11:15] one it will rewrite
[1:11:18] everything ches of their
[1:11:22] Liv hallelujah hallelujah and that's
[1:11:24] what Moses
[1:11:26] found and God took his
[1:11:29] side God was bound to do
[1:11:32] that because of one thing Grace and we
[1:11:35] find here Lord Lord is as you know he
[1:11:39] was a he was a a relative
[1:11:41] of of
[1:11:45] Abraham you know and and and and here he
[1:11:50] was uh I think I think it was Abraham's
[1:11:52] nephew
[1:11:53] right I know one time I was preaching
[1:11:56] here and I said he was Abraham's
[1:11:59] cousin sometimes you just understand
[1:12:02] what I'm trying
[1:12:05] to praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:12:09] lot now the angel of the Lord the two
[1:12:12] angels go
[1:12:14] down to pick Lord and his family why
[1:12:19] because Lord had found
[1:12:21] Grace in the sight of God
[1:12:25] understand I don't think that lot was
[1:12:27] better
[1:12:29] than L was
[1:12:32] back lot loved
[1:12:35] cities when Abraham told him pick where
[1:12:38] you will
[1:12:39] go he looked over and saw a big
[1:12:43] city
[1:12:45] called he said I go to one
[1:12:47] of and Abraham went to the
[1:12:50] desert lot desired always to live in a
[1:12:53] city I believe maybe he liked soft
[1:12:57] life maybe he liked something you know a
[1:12:59] life of no
[1:13:01] strugg a place where he could be happy
[1:13:03] with his
[1:13:04] family things like that and and so he
[1:13:08] went there and and Abraham let him go
[1:13:12] there but then now when when God had
[1:13:14] come down to destroy
[1:13:18] Sodom lot was right in the middle of
[1:13:25] did you know that even if you were in
[1:13:27] the middle
[1:13:29] of if you find Grace in the eyes of
[1:13:33] the do you know you cannot perish
[1:13:37] with did you know you cannot and here he
[1:13:41] was right in the middle
[1:13:44] of I believe it was a physical thing but
[1:13:46] also it meant something
[1:13:49] figurative because when this man came
[1:13:53] wanting the the two angels that enter
[1:13:55] the
[1:13:56] house Lord reached over to them and he
[1:13:59] said my
[1:14:00] brothers he called them his
[1:14:03] brothers
[1:14:05] SES I don't think I don't think lot was
[1:14:08] any
[1:14:10] better but Lord had found
[1:14:14] Grace in the eyes of the Lord and when
[1:14:18] the Angels came into that
[1:14:20] house you know of course they smart
[1:14:23] those people with blindness
[1:14:25] and they Clos thems
[1:14:27] in and they told Lord it is time for you
[1:14:31] to flee the
[1:14:33] city because fire is coming
[1:14:36] down oh let me tell you brethren we are
[1:14:39] living in a modern
[1:14:41] day but we are
[1:14:43] different may be in the middle
[1:14:48] of we have receiv the message of
[1:14:51] GRA Hallelujah and right there they told
[1:14:54] him
[1:14:55] time to
[1:14:56] escape time to
[1:14:58] escape and it came to pass when they had
[1:15:00] brought them forth
[1:15:01] [Applause]
[1:15:03] abroad that he said Escape for your
[1:15:07] life look not behind you neither stay
[1:15:11] thou in all the
[1:15:14] pl the Angels told him escape to the
[1:15:21] mountain oh my God to hear
[1:15:26] closely the Angels now are speaking to
[1:15:31] lot his wife and his daughters escaped
[1:15:36] to the
[1:15:37] mountain now that you may be not
[1:15:41] consumed that's what the word of God say
[1:15:44] through the Angels but here is a man who
[1:15:48] had another
[1:15:51] desire now I wanted to show you this to
[1:15:54] me when I read like
[1:15:58] why I saw something that I thought I
[1:16:00] should I should impress upon
[1:16:02] you that Grace does the
[1:16:06] impossible God doesn't change his
[1:16:08] word and God does not have
[1:16:11] respect but Grace is Far and Beyond
[1:16:16] what and now this man when he had the
[1:16:19] Angels telling him run to the
[1:16:22] m brother do you know what he said
[1:16:25] he said no no no
[1:16:28] no not no mountain
[1:16:38] no please my Lord no I'm not going to
[1:16:42] the
[1:16:45] mountain God has sent you a
[1:16:48] message and you are saying no to his
[1:16:52] Mage why because
[1:16:55] L had a
[1:16:57] revelation had a
[1:16:59] revelation he had
[1:17:02] something was more precious than
[1:17:04] God he had something that even the
[1:17:08] angels
[1:17:10] cannot had something that was powerful
[1:17:14] and even the angels had to bow to that
[1:17:18] and that's what he pulled out he said
[1:17:20] I'm not going to the
[1:17:22] mountains I am not going to the mountain
[1:17:26] behold if your
[1:17:29] servant if your
[1:17:31] servant has found
[1:17:34] Grace you are saying I found Grace if I
[1:17:37] found Grace
[1:17:40] in then you have magnified your
[1:17:45] mercy which have showed me in saving my
[1:17:50] life and I cannot escape to the
[1:17:53] mountain why can't you escape because I
[1:17:57] know I have found Grace multiplied

[1:27:54] the name of the
[1:27:56] Lord in the message the unchangeable god
[1:28:01] 196 would say every
[1:28:03] soul that comes to God seeking salvation
[1:28:06] or
[1:28:09] healing he's going to come on on those
[1:28:13] basis he's going to come believing that
[1:28:15] God
[1:28:16] is and
[1:28:20] reward did not our lord Jesus say
[1:28:24] whatever things you
[1:28:26] desire When you pray believe that you
[1:28:29] will receive
[1:28:30] them and you shall have
[1:28:34] them Jesus said that the prophet says
[1:28:37] Jesus said
[1:28:39] that I am saying the
[1:28:47] prophetes if you
[1:28:51] pray Hallelujah amen did not he say ask
[1:28:57] the father what you will in
[1:29:00] my
[1:29:01] receive now that is infallibly the
[1:29:13] truth and there is
[1:29:15] nobody that ever ask
[1:29:19] God but what God gave it to them if they
[1:29:22] come with unhonest heart
[1:29:33] if God inspired me to preach
[1:29:36] this God is anointing someone's
[1:29:40] face for what they
[1:29:43] Des Hallelujah if you come to God with a
[1:29:47] honest
[1:29:48] heart he will always give you
[1:29:51] what and the thing of it is
[1:29:55] God gives it sometimes in in the way
[1:29:57] that we are not
[1:30:00] expecting but God always keeps his
[1:30:07] word so in other words you ask what you
[1:30:10] want God will give it to
[1:30:12] you the difference is not all times
[1:30:17] sometimes he may give it to you in a way
[1:30:19] you never expected it
[1:30:25] but not all times sometimes so in other
[1:30:29] words most of the time gives it to you
[1:30:32] the way you
[1:30:33] want the way you
[1:30:36] expected but the fact is he always
[1:30:39] anwers a
[1:30:42] prayer there is no way for God to tell
[1:30:45] you anything and lie about it and remain
[1:30:51] God he canot must keep his word

[1:34:35] people and thou Hast not let me know
[1:34:37] whom thou will send me with who thou

[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:22] foree
[1:37:52] for for
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:32] I want you to see talking about
[1:38:35] Moses Moses was a man that was not
[1:38:41] perfect by the way there is no servant
[1:38:43] of God on Earth that was
[1:38:47] ever because all human beings need
[1:38:51] Grace if there was one
[1:38:54] perfect then we did not need
[1:38:57] Grace we did not need Jesus's death on
[1:38:59] the
[1:39:00] cross we need
[1:39:02] salvation but there was only one
[1:39:05] worthy that is the Lamb of
[1:39:08] God world but even the greatest of
[1:39:12] prophets they had their own
[1:39:14] insufficiency so we find that
[1:39:17] Moses as he came before the presence of
[1:39:20] God and God told him now to go and take
[1:39:22] his people
[1:39:25] Moses knew this
[1:39:27] one he wanted to be
[1:39:30] sure found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[1:39:35] by the way that is the only thing you
[1:39:37] need to be sure
[1:39:38] of when he says make your calling and
[1:39:41] election
[1:39:43] sure means find Grace in the eyes of the
[1:39:49] Lord be sure
[1:39:52] that mes wanted to be sure I am going to
[1:39:56] go but before I go I want to be
[1:40:00] sure I found
[1:40:02] Grace in
[1:40:04] your and he says if I found Grace in
[1:40:07] your I have a
[1:40:09] request show me now thy
[1:40:13] way that I may know the that I may find
[1:40:17] Grace in your sight you want to know
[1:40:22] him you want to know him you want to
[1:40:25] find his way Moses had everything but
[1:40:29] Moses had hunger said I want to see
[1:40:34] you
[1:40:39] iction I know you you have a
[1:40:43] desire to
[1:40:45] God
[1:40:46] experience the bapm of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:49] you have a
[1:40:51] desire remember you have found
[1:40:54] Grace in his sight whatsoever your
[1:40:57] desire is he gives it to you he gives it
[1:41:01] to you he gives it to you that is why
[1:41:05] doesn't answer all
[1:41:07] prayers especially those of people that
[1:41:12] have not found
[1:41:13] Grace but the people who have found
[1:41:17] Grace in his he calls them my
[1:41:21] people and he said
[1:41:23] his my
[1:41:27] people and pray then I will hear and I
[1:41:31] will answer so now Moses was aware that
[1:41:36] he was not
[1:41:38] anyone
[1:41:42] found my God I feel like
[1:41:45] speaking let me tell you there are
[1:41:48] people on
[1:41:49] Earth cannot say
[1:41:53] [Applause]
[1:41:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:00] people cannot say
[1:42:02] no cannot say
[1:42:04] no cannot
[1:42:07] say I will not
[1:42:10] be I will not
[1:42:13] be hallelujah amen why because I'm his I
[1:42:18] am his and his mine and Moses knew that
[1:42:22] that's why when Moses started
[1:42:24] asking Moses did not ask for one
[1:42:27] thing he asked for more he kept on
[1:42:31] asking ask I believe that if we as
[1:42:36] Believers can be in prayer we can change
[1:42:39] the world why because God answers the
[1:42:43] prayer of
[1:42:46] Believers hallelujah how many of you was
[1:42:49] lost in prayer
[1:42:54] pray you go and close yourself
[1:42:57] somewhere you see you pray too little
[1:43:01] that's you receive to but let me
[1:43:03] challenge us let us turn
[1:43:07] ourselves into prayer
[1:43:11] machines let us make it like a
[1:43:14] challenge in our homes we we begin to
[1:43:18] pray you know in our homes in our prayer
[1:43:21] closet individually
[1:43:24] each of us families husband and and we
[1:43:28] begin to do prayer
[1:43:30] Retreats going to begin to see
[1:43:32] Revival you're going to see God moving
[1:43:35] in
[1:43:36] power why because when God hears the
[1:43:39] prayer of a
[1:43:42] Believer he lives whatever he's doing
[1:43:45] Hees whatever he doing say who is that
[1:43:48] you remember that woman everybody was
[1:43:51] touching him this woman
[1:43:53] she was a Believer she was a Believer
[1:43:57] came tou he left
[1:44:00] everything who is that who is that that
[1:44:04] touched Meer said Master everybody's
[1:44:07] touching me he said no this is a
[1:44:10] different
[1:44:13] tou the prayer of a
[1:44:15] Believer is a different
[1:44:18] prayer Hallelujah it doesn't need to be
[1:44:21] saved
[1:44:24] received no it goes direct to the throne
[1:44:29] room because you have direct
[1:44:32] access you have direct
[1:44:35] access to
[1:44:37] the when you begin to pray don't you
[1:44:40] worry you may feel like a sinner you may
[1:44:43] feel defeated there Grace when you have
[1:44:46] Grace stand
[1:44:49] between
[1:44:50] your and God and then your prayer
[1:44:58] go Hallelujah and when the devil
[1:45:02] hears he begins to shake he begins to
[1:45:06] tremble because he can't understand what
[1:45:09] is happening what is happening I thought
[1:45:14] I finish that I that little I thought
[1:45:19] more what is
[1:45:21] going something going on when I believer
[1:45:25] begin to pray why because you have a
[1:45:30] speci your
[1:45:32] life brother if you feel
[1:45:34] defeated don't worry go in prayer go in
[1:45:38] prayer even if you're messed
[1:45:41] up when you begin to pray you begin to
[1:45:44] sh every G
[1:45:47] of begin sh
[1:45:53] now I am
[1:45:58] preaching begin to
[1:46:02] move that is the power of
[1:46:04] Grace Hallelujah the power of
[1:46:08] Grace the power of
[1:46:11] Grace and Moses knew that when he came
[1:46:14] before God he was not asking for
[1:46:18] little he asked abundantly
[1:46:23] he said show me your way I want to know
[1:46:25] your with after that he said go with us
[1:46:30] go with us can you prove you will go
[1:46:32] with us I go with
[1:46:35] you if you don't go with us we cannot go
[1:46:40] how will they know that you are with us
[1:46:43] you have to go with us and after that he
[1:46:47] said I'm not about to finish I'm about
[1:46:50] to finish
[1:46:52] I want
[1:46:54] more show me thy
[1:46:57] Glory
[1:47:01] Hallelujah God was
[1:47:04] overwhelmed no man has ever asked him
[1:47:08] this the request were so
[1:47:11] big but no request is big for
[1:47:16] our yourest is not big for
[1:47:20] God it is not so big for God
[1:47:23] your prayer will make a
[1:47:24] way because your prayer Hallelujah is a
[1:47:28] prayer that has
[1:47:30] found so you're not just anybody
[1:47:35] just no you a person of God and when
[1:47:39] Moses asked this things God
[1:47:44] said God could not say
[1:47:49] no God could not say no
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:47:58] will not say to
[1:48:00] you when Moses prayed all these
[1:48:04] things sister
[1:48:06] Grace God did not say
[1:48:09] no do you know what he
[1:48:12] did he made a
[1:48:17] provision you want to see my
[1:48:20] glory no one has ever seen that
[1:48:24] said now
[1:48:25] Moses now you know let me explain
[1:48:28] something to
[1:48:29] you if you see me you will
[1:48:34] die but mother said Show Me Your
[1:48:39] Glory because he knew he cannot be
[1:48:44] denied had
[1:48:46] found in
[1:48:48] the so now God began as you would say
[1:48:52] fting
[1:48:54] what
[1:48:58] can
[1:49:01] God remember this was before Jesus was
[1:49:04] born so God had to bring
[1:49:13] his and
[1:49:16] presented but he told him here's what we
[1:49:19] going to do he began to negotiate
[1:49:26] God sometimes if he doesn't give you
[1:49:28] exactly what
[1:49:29] you he will give it to but in another
[1:49:33] wayes wanted to seek God
[1:49:36] himself but God
[1:49:41] negoti but here is the
[1:49:44] deal
[1:49:46] thees he said to him behold there is a
[1:49:50] place by me
[1:49:52] and you shall stand upon a
[1:49:56] rock upon a rock and it shall come to
[1:50:01] pass now while my glory passes
[1:50:06] back that I will put
[1:50:09] thee in the C of the
[1:50:14] rock you see Moses I'm standing here you
[1:50:18] can't see me you see me but because you
[1:50:22] have
