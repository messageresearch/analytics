[9:07] [Music]
[9:13] just some little sharing this evening
[9:21] verse 26 of Luke 1 Luca is
[9:30] let us uh first speak to the Lord
[9:35] Jesus as we take the pages of your holy
[9:38] word we are not worthy
[9:43] you are the one Lord
[9:47] and help us to understand what we are
[9:50] going to read
[9:53] also give us utterance
[9:57] that your people shall be blessed
[10:00] tonight
[10:01] in Jesus name is
[10:04] amen I mean so we read verse 26 of Luke
[10:08] 1. Luke
[10:13] and in this and in the sixth month the
[10:17] angel Gabriel was sent from God and to a
[10:20] city of Galilee named Nazareth
[10:24] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[10:27] was Joseph of the House of David
[10:31] and the virgin's name was Mary
[10:34] and the angel came in unto her and said
[10:39] excuse me hail Thou Art highly favored
[10:43] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[10:46] among women
[10:48] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[10:51] his saying and cast
[10:54] in her mind what manner of salutation
[10:57] this should be
[10:58] and the angel said unto her
[11:01] fear not Mary
[11:03] for thou has found favor with God
[11:06] and behold thus shall conceive in thy
[11:10] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[11:14] call his name Jesus
[11:16] he shall be great and shall be called
[11:19] the son of the highest and the Lord God
[11:21] shall give unto him the Throne of his
[11:24] father David
[11:25] and he shall reign over the house of
[11:27] Jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[11:31] shall be no end
[11:33] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[11:37] this be saying I know not a man
[11:40] and the angel answered and said unto her
[11:43] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[11:47] the power of the highest shall
[11:49] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[11:53] thing which shall be born in thee shall
[11:57] be called The Son of God and behold thy
[12:01] cast in Elizabeth
[12:03] she has also conceived a son in her old
[12:05] age and this is the sixth month with her
[12:08] who was called Baron
[12:11] for with god listen to this for with God
[12:14] nothing shall be impossible
[12:31] foreign
[12:50] [Music]
[13:31] foreign
[14:09] foreign
[15:08] and by denominational people
[15:13] and especially around the birth of Jesus
[15:16] they they read a lot of this video yes
[15:21] about Mary and how of course the
[15:24] Catholics love Mary when you know in
[15:26] Ethiopia when you talk about Mary they
[15:28] feel so good and they feel so excited
[15:36] even when someone was not going to give
[15:38] you their ears when you the moment you
[15:40] speak about Mary now they can give you
[15:42] their ears
[15:47] but one of the reasons why I love the
[15:50] message
[15:53] always teaches in types
[16:01] usually especially in the Old Testament
[16:04] you take those and then he was able to
[16:07] apply them in to fulfill them to show
[16:10] their fulfillment in the ministry of
[16:12] Jesus Christ
[16:20] for example David with
[16:24] Christo you know he's able to type
[16:26] Joseph and say that that was a type of
[16:29] Christ
[16:34] he explains in detail in English
[16:39] there's a lot of detail on those types
[16:44] and so then we also see that uh here in
[16:49] the New Testament we can also see many
[16:52] of these characters there in the New
[16:54] Testament as types of the Bride of the
[16:56] end times
[17:00] [Music]
[17:04] you remember one time I've spoken on the
[17:07] on the thief on the cross
[17:11] how the thief on the cross is a type
[17:15] of the Church of the Bride because
[17:18] [Music]
[17:19] remember that song which we used to sing
[17:22] say oh that dying Thief Rejoice to see
[17:25] that fountain in his day
[17:29] [Music]
[17:32] we can talk about Lazarus
[17:35] we can talk about many characters
[17:38] but tonight I'd like us to take a
[17:41] character
[17:47] also is a type of the True Church of
[17:50] Christ of Jesus Christ
[17:55] Mary is a type who can look at her as a
[17:59] type of the Bride actually
[18:03] as a virgin bride of Christ
[18:07] you remember the story that Jesus Christ
[18:10] gave of the five ways virgins and the
[18:12] five foolish virgins
[18:20] when the trumpet sounded
[18:24] then the wise virgins
[18:28] of course all of them were sleeping
[18:31] so when the trumpet sounded in the
[18:34] middle of the night
[18:37] all the ten virgins arose
[18:42] but you see the five wise virgins
[18:46] [Music]
[18:48] they had extra oil
[18:51] [Music]
[18:53] you see you know all the others had oil
[18:58] this morning I was discussing with my
[19:01] wife
[19:01] and she was asking me why brother I'm
[19:03] called the other some of the
[19:05] denominational people Christians
[19:07] children of God Believers
[19:16] and you know to be a Christian you must
[19:19] have Christ in you right
[19:23] call them Christians
[19:27] yes they are Christians all over yes
[19:31] it's just like I can say there are many
[19:34] message Believers all over the world
[19:39] and now if to go in the Rapture if all
[19:42] that you needed to go in the Rapture was
[19:45] to believe or accept the message
[19:53] then I'm telling you there are many
[19:55] people going in the Rapture
[19:57] you don't even need to struggle
[20:00] I just do everything you do you just
[20:02] believe the message
[20:05] but you see believing the message is
[20:07] only a foundation
[20:11] it is the best upon which you receive
[20:15] the requirement for the Rapture
[20:20] and so we see that this virgins they
[20:23] were all virgins
[20:26] there's only one thing that can make
[20:29] someone a virgin
[20:31] if they have character
[20:34] and you cannot get character without the
[20:37] word
[20:41] bible believers
[20:45] they had the character of the world
[20:49] but they also had the oil
[20:53] which was the spirit
[20:56] says that you see you can receive the
[21:00] Holy Spirit upon your spirit
[21:06] but not filled in your soul
[21:10] um
[21:18] how one day he was so anointed when he
[21:21] had gone to kill David
[21:24] because he had said many of his uh
[21:27] people to go and kill David but you see
[21:29] whenever they would arrive there David
[21:31] was among the prophets
[21:37] so you see whoever went there became
[21:40] anointed to prophesy
[21:45] and yet they were not prophets but they
[21:49] began jumping up and down saying thus
[21:51] say the Lord
[21:53] and the Soul said why are you not
[21:56] fulfilling what I've told you today
[22:01] until finally he said let me go myself I
[22:04] shot this boy
[22:07] when he arrived there where he found
[22:10] himself also jumping up and down
[22:12] prophesying
[22:15] he was anointed
[22:17] through Jane wine spirit of God
[22:22] he was not a prophet you see so someone
[22:26] can be anointed to prophesy
[22:29] when they are not really prophets
[22:33] in the same way someone can be Anointed
[22:36] with the spirit the true spirit of God
[22:40] when they are not filled with the Holy
[22:43] Ghost in their souls
[22:46] preached that someone called the
[22:48] anointed ones at the end of time
[22:54] they are anointed with a true genuine
[22:57] holy ghosts
[23:02] so false anointed ones
[23:06] so you see these virgins
[23:09] yes I can see that someone wants to hear
[23:12] a little more about that
[23:14] we are false
[23:17] because they did not bring forth the
[23:20] right sin cubanga foreign
[24:05] [Music]
[24:11] [Music]
[24:12] Hallelujah
[24:18] [Music]
[24:19] [Applause]
[24:59] [Music]
[25:16] the weed did not become the wheat
[25:19] because it received the rain
[25:37] [Music]
[25:45] [Applause]
[26:14] only the true seed of God will mature
[26:17] into the full stage of Christ
[26:28] by the water
[26:31] um
[26:33] that spirit of God will bring out amen
[26:37] that which was in you before the
[26:39] foundation of the world
[26:45] Amen Amina it will not change
[26:48] he will bring forth what is in you touch
[26:51] you that you could choose
[26:54] that's why I always tell you the devil
[26:56] cannot defeat Us
[26:59] big nature which we are born with
[27:04] our original nature
[27:08] we will not be smelled Lambs they
[27:12] probably busy
[27:14] we were alarmed with a big nature
[27:18] [Music]
[27:22] it showed us who we really are
[27:26] amen and every day we begin dropping
[27:30] that nature which is not
[27:35] using the nature that who is really in
[27:38] us
[27:43] and that's the reason why he overshadows
[27:46] us with the Holy Ghost
[27:49] so we go back to the virgins
[27:52] for the five wise virgins
[27:55] are the foolish virgins they had oil
[27:58] both of them but
[28:00] the oil of the five foolish virgins
[28:05] that the anointing will always run out
[28:08] of
[28:10] foreign
[29:12] these ones we're ready
[29:15] they trimmed the alarm
[29:18] hallelujah hallelujah amen and that is
[29:52] they told The Voice once told the
[29:54] foolish ones
[29:58] I am sorry
[30:00] go to those that serve again
[30:04] let them sell you
[30:06] what we have is only enough
[30:12] you cannot share the Holy Spirit
[30:23] that God who gave that brother has to
[30:26] give you your own portion
[30:31] and when you receive your portions will
[30:34] receive it for free
[30:36] for free it begins by receiving the
[30:40] world
[30:45] confessing everyone and the more you get
[30:49] into the word of God Amen
[30:53] but you you find yourself in amen
[30:56] wrapped up and Tangled Up With Jesus
[31:02] and
[31:06] it begins to change your nature
[31:13] and so these people they had to go and
[31:15] find their own Holy Spirit
[31:18] we have to go and do the crying
[31:21] to go and do their searching
[31:26] but the only problem was
[31:32] time will come one time will run out
[31:34] [Music]
[31:36] going to be very sad for people who are
[31:39] attending church
[31:42] and many of them are going to be message
[31:44] Believers
[31:46] because in the message it's where we
[31:49] really teach the Rapture the others
[31:50] don't know much about the Rapture
[31:56] a few others may take the Rapture but
[31:58] not in details
[32:01] emphasize it because it's not their main
[32:04] objectives
[32:08] teach the tribulation they say that the
[32:10] Saints will go through the tribulation
[32:12] [Music]
[32:23] we are going to go up
[32:26] together when the world will go in the
[32:29] tribulations
[32:42] we shall be there together
[32:50] it's not yours to do
[33:08] we have to receive the Holy Spirit
[33:17] now let us look at
[33:21] Maryam Mary was a virgin Mary and the
[33:25] angel came to her
[33:27] Mary was a woman like all the others
[33:31] she was born in sin
[33:34] she was sheltered iniquity
[33:36] she was sinful and she was a weak vessel
[33:41] you see the Holy Ghost does not
[33:43] overshadow the perfect
[33:47] day amen amen the holy ghosts
[33:50] overshadows the sinful those who
[33:53] accepted in iniquity those who are born
[33:55] in sin and those who are weak um
[34:02] when God came down he told Mary Mary
[34:06] God favors you oh
[34:36] [Music]
[34:38] the Lord is with thee the Lord is with
[34:41] blessed are thou among women blessed are
[34:43] thou among women
[34:53] amen we are highly favored
[34:56] amen the Lord is with us
[34:59] we are blessed among a church
[35:03] why because we are the bride of Christ
[35:07] we have been chosen
[35:10] bring forth the promised son
[35:13] it is
[35:30] very hard only one question
[35:34] shall this be
[35:37] and then the answer was definite
[35:41] even though holy ghosts shall come upon
[35:44] thee um
[35:53] for with God
[35:56] for with God
[35:58] nothing shall be impossible Hallelujah
[36:05] Amina
[36:33] I do not see how possibly this can
[36:35] failure
[36:40] when I look at myself
[36:45] maybe you want to say the same thing
[36:51] foreign
[37:12] [Music]
[37:34] I don't see this happening
[37:38] but when I see you
[37:40] the confidence
[37:54] and the moment Mary say that
[37:58] all the Holy Ghost came down
[38:06] amen she received something in her womb
[38:10] and you know our womb is the soul
[38:15] [Music]
[38:17] the word listen listen when you believe
[38:20] the word the word must bring the Holy
[38:22] Ghost
[38:26] if the word you believe does not bring
[38:29] down the Holy Ghost it is
[38:49] foreign
[39:29] foreign
[40:27] I
[40:29] just started
[40:35] shouting I'm rejoicing Ninja
[40:52] I don't think she said that I was
[40:54] yesterday
[41:04] the Holy Spirit
[41:10] [Music]
[42:03] until one day we will all be filled with
[42:07] the Holy Ghost that we will be able to
[42:08] go in a Rapture tonight
[42:13] until even the devil will not know what
[42:16] to do with us
[42:19] I want to be one man who is so filled
[42:23] with all because that the devil will try
[42:25] to tempt me but he doesn't know what to
[42:27] do with me
[42:36] Hallelujah
[42:41] we will actually be the Thunder to the
[42:44] devil
[42:50] foreign
[42:56] that he never would send you his agents
[43:02] and
[43:03] those agents will touch fire
[43:07] and they themselves would be changed
[43:15] that's the power of the Holy Ghost
[43:20] that's the power of the Holy Ghost
[43:22] we were walking on the streets I told
[43:25] you I've told you this story many times
[43:33] you know money
[43:38] she came to work
[43:41] but she came around to men
[43:44] who were so filled with the power of God
[43:50] you know where she ended up
[43:57] I believe those are the testimons we
[44:00] need to have um
[44:04] we don't want Brothers to come here
[44:08] just forgive me he was out there
[44:14] where was the Holy Ghost
[44:18] where was he because if he overshadows
[44:25] the devil cannot even know what to do
[44:28] with you
[44:30] yes
[44:40] but he will overcome each time
[44:44] and you will be a testimony
[44:48] it's not ourselves that do it
[44:52] they know how of the Holy Ghost that
[44:54] overshadows Us
[44:57] in Romans 9 15 he says
[45:01] to Moses I will have Master on whom I
[45:04] will have mercy and I will have
[45:06] compassion and whom I will have
[45:07] compassion
[45:09] um
[45:13] [Music]
[45:19] and then he says so then it is not of
[45:22] him that we will wait to see you you are
[45:26] your Gala nor of him that runeth Amina
[45:37] it's not because of me that I receive
[45:40] the holy ghosts
[45:41] [Music]
[45:43] I was only a little poor Mary
[45:47] leaving my little sinful life
[45:51] and then one day
[45:53] and then one day the angel of God showed
[45:58] us
[45:59] and when he showed up
[46:01] he told me things I've never had before
[46:05] and then what I believe to them
[46:09] when I received it when I believed
[46:32] let your wife be born
[46:35] in the manger of my heart
[46:39] you see this is what we need to treat
[46:43] Our God let me tell you when you come to
[46:44] Christ
[46:45] you should have a desire to birth the
[46:48] Holy Spirit
[46:52] the church is a labor one
[46:56] I told you in a hospital
[47:01] and churches are hospitals
[47:07] touches our hospitals
[47:10] but in the hospitals there are two
[47:13] important places
[47:16] the first one
[47:19] is a very important place
[47:22] without it
[47:24] there is no hospital
[47:27] is the mortuary
[47:33] everything is in order
[47:38] foreign
[48:04] the order of the mortuary
[48:12] be
[48:13] quiet now
[48:19] if I type that with the church
[48:23] you'll also find some
[48:27] denominationals
[48:33] that are actually representing that
[48:36] guanica whatever they read here
[48:40] tells them to be quiet foreign
[48:49] brother
[49:00] you'll even read for you somewhere
[49:02] like those ones in another room
[49:06] let's not disturb the peace
[49:18] I was really enjoying it but
[49:22] then that
[49:24] Other Woman disturb myself
[49:48] for him to be able to preach yes
[50:06] even when you are anointed you can't
[50:08] preacher
[50:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:20] the next thing they can do is to does
[50:24] everything they can do is maybe to work
[50:26] out or use their phone
[50:32] that is a dead religion
[50:36] says
[50:49] [Music]
[50:56] if your religion has no emotions
[51:11] so that the power of the Holy Spirit
[51:16] you see those things bring down the Holy
[51:18] Spirit
[51:28] [Music]
[51:34] [Music]
[52:18] you can never hire foreign
[52:25] [Music]
[52:53] that will bring down something
[52:56] and then after that when the Holocaust
[53:01] come
[53:02] there will also be noise
[53:07] [Music]
[53:10] when a baby is born
[53:16] then they say yes
[53:47] [Applause]
[53:56] [Music]
[54:00] [Applause]
[54:04] hallelujah amen and he also has his own
[54:07] noise
[54:09] the noise of the Holy Ghost is the life
[54:12] that it brings in you
[54:18] hallelujah amen and that's the part the
[54:21] blessing where I want to be
[54:24] I want to be in that mess
[54:28] may God help us
[54:34] a place where the dead are kept 84.
[54:38] where there is zero temperature of the
[54:40] spirit
[54:42] so it's not him that runeth
[54:52] by allowing the Holy Spirit to
[54:55] overshadow us
[54:57] we didn't even want
[55:00] we didn't even run to get it
[55:05] we were just running away from him to
[55:13] from the beginning was running away
[55:20] he came seeking for us
[55:35] and they found me
[55:39] and when when we we had the word of life
[55:44] we received his message
[55:48] it says then he answered and spoken to
[55:51] me saying
[55:53] this is the word of the Lord
[55:57] say not by might not by power but by my
[56:01] spirit
[56:02] ual money
[56:07] amen Amina if you believe him you get
[56:10] picked by the Holy Ghost
[56:14] it's not by you trying to do it
[56:20] you just believe the word
[56:22] and the word
[56:26] amen by the bottom says in the message
[56:29] the angel of the Lord the new birth is
[56:30] an experience
[56:36] it's a gift of God it's the Seal of your
[56:40] faith
[56:43] the holy spirit is
[56:48] the name of the Lord amen
[56:51] God made Abraham the promise
[56:54] and Abraham believed God
[56:56] was justified by faith
[56:59] and God give him the sign of
[57:02] circumcision
[57:05] so he does today
[57:08] we believe in him and then if you say
[57:11] you believe
[57:13] and do not receive the Holy Spirit
[57:18] if you so many believe here
[57:22] foreign
[58:10] do you know the longest time it took for
[58:12] people to receive the Holy Spirit
[58:14] [Music]
[58:20] how many
[58:25] in the upper room hey yes
[58:33] that was long because they were tiring
[58:36] waiting for him for the first time
[58:41] for us it doesn't have to be 10 days
[58:43] immediately
[58:49] immediately
[58:52] as a matter of fact I'm challenging you
[58:53] don't leave this service without
[58:54] receiving the words
[58:59] if you believe it you believe the holy
[59:03] spirit
[59:05] amen
[59:07] just lift up your hands
[59:12] I want the Holy Spirit I receive the
[59:15] Holy Spirit
[59:20] if you ask but Sarah you receive he says
[59:27] if you believe you shall receive
[59:32] it's very complicated
[59:36] going to pray for Saturdays and Saturday
[59:38] nights
[59:43] it's not him that Runners
[59:52] all you have to do is to believe
[59:57] hmm and then if you say you believe
[1:00:02] this is your Prophet now and you don't
[1:00:05] receive the holy spirit
[1:00:10] because God promise
[1:00:21] and now in believing
[1:00:24] you do not receive the Holy Spirit When
[1:00:26] You Believe
[1:00:32] Paul asked in Acts 19 have you received
[1:00:35] the Holy Spirit since she believed
[1:00:43] I believe the message I have received
[1:00:46] the Holy Spirit
[1:00:52] you see
[1:00:54] Paul asked them did you receive the Holy
[1:00:58] Spirit since you believed
[1:01:02] it's a gift of God
[1:01:05] and when that when the spirit of God
[1:01:08] comes into a man
[1:01:11] it quickens him
[1:01:13] and then it becomes a new creature
[1:01:16] he believes in the immortal gods
[1:01:21] that he does all sings
[1:01:26] in tune with God
[1:01:31] like you believe
[1:01:34] and you believed you saved and his blood
[1:01:38] was applied upon your life
[1:01:41] you must also believe in the Holy Spirit
[1:01:46] is yours
[1:01:50] when you believe that history
[1:01:57] and he says and when the spirit of God
[1:01:59] comes into a man's heart
[1:02:03] all his intellectuals just fed um
[1:02:06] and the Darkness and the doubts just go
[1:02:09] away

[1:02:43] and you truly are one of God's
[1:02:46] attributes that he spoke
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:02:53] now if you're not
[1:02:56] only you will wonder and frustrate and
[1:02:58] run here and run there and everything
[1:03:00] else

[1:03:07] truth

[1:03:11] all things pass away right now
[1:03:14] and you become new the power of
