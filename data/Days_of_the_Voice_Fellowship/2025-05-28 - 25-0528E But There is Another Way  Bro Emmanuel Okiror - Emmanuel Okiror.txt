Even when it seems all is finished, Lord, you're always in our midst. Thank you, Lord Jesus Almighty. We trust that Lord, you're here with us. And we believe that Lord Jesus Christ, you're going to speak unto us, oh Lord. Let thy holy spirit come down. Let it pass into each each one's heart. Let us find that portion that you prepared for us today for the glory of thy holy name. Father I thank you for everything. Oh Lord Jesus by your grace that father we are standing here again to come before thy presence oh Lord Jesus to present the bread of life to your own children. Father, let you completely come and take over. Let you bless the hearers, oh Lord, that I may even put this word into action. Thank you, Lord. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Do you love the Lord? I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Maybe before we sit, we can read from the book of Proverbs chapter 14. Proverbs 14:12 only. Then we shall read even prover then we shall read even John chapter 10 verse 10. Praise the Lord. Proverbs chapter 14 verse 12. Proverbs 14. Chapter 14 verse 12. The Bible says, "There is a way which seemth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. Then chapter 10 verse 10 of John. The Bible says that the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy. I am come that they might have life and they might have it in more abundantly. [Music] Amen. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. I greet you again once for in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. and please receive greetings from pastor. He sends your his greetings to all the saints of the church and I believe that we always pray upon the prayer request that he has always sent to different platforms and I'm very sure the Lord shall answer them. Praise the Lord. praying for me also for it's just my first time to stand here. But I'm sure the Lord will speak to us. Do you believe? Do you believe that? Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Even greetings from my dear wife. She's not here with us, but possibly she's following us. Praise the Lord. There was one time at our workplace I had an encounter with about three people and the three people we had called them to do some work with us. But when they arrived the work was not ready for them to do yet. I had a little time to discuss with them something which the Lord had put in my heart. So I started speaking to them. All of them had a feedback. One said, "I'm a born again." The other said, "I am a Christian." The other one kept quiet. But these two was a born again and a Christian said that for that one, he doesn't believe in God. That is who is praise the Lord. So afterwards, we started speaking to with one another. We had a conversation for about a long time. Praise the Lord. So as we spoke, I engaged the one who was who call himself a born again person. I said since you gave your life to Christ, you have been moving with two friends of yours. What do you tell about them? What have you told them about Christ? The man said, I'm a born again person. I'm not a preacher. Praise the Lord. Then when he said, I'm not a preacher, For me, I just do dancing church. That is what I do. Then I went to the one who's a Muslim. Since you're Muslim, what good things have you shared with your other friends? He said, "I'm a Muslim. I don't know those things that you praise the Lord." Now, when I went to the sad person, the one who doesn't believe in God, for him, he kept quiet completely. But the two people who spoke said a lot of things about him, they started praising him. They said this man doesn't believe in God. He has his God that he he worships. And they said how does he worship his God, they said this man when they go to their group, they take they shake their heads. That is how they worship their God. Praise the Lord. And a lot of things that they spoke about this man praised him in many ways. Praise the Lord. But I want to tell you out of our conversation something came into my mind. I told him among all the three of you. All of you doesn't have any strong stand of your your [Music] faith. So there's another way I want to share with you and that is the way of salvation. Praise the Lord. So we started speaking with one another. At the end of it, all of them were quiet. He had no words. The one who claimed to be a born again person was also quiet. He seemed like he had never given his life to Christ. The one who claimed to be a Muslim was equally quiet. Praise the Lord. That's why today something inspired me out of that speech. I got some inspiration out of that conversation. There must be another way. That is what we are going to share. But there is another way. If all of them never had a right way, there must be another way. Praise the Lord. That's why we have read from the book of Proverbs 14:12. 14:12 that there is a way which seemth right unto man. That way it seems right unto man. Praise the Lord. But the end of it is a waste of death. Then chapter 10 verse 10 of John. Praise the Lord. The Bible says that oh the Lord Jesus Christ said, I come that they might have life and they might have it in more abundance. Praise the Lord. Maybe this brother can display something here. Praise the Lord. If he has it with him, it is something just to display something about death and life and we shall see as time goes. Praise the Lord. Now the way that seem as right unto man, there are many ways in life. One of it could be a physical death. that there's a way that sin is right unto man. One of it is that which lead us unto death. But the Lord Jesus Christ gave us another way and that way is a way of life. Praise the Lord. But we are going to talk a little more about the way that lead us into death. We are not going to talk about death itself. But we are going to talk about the world. Praise the Lord. Now the death we are talking about can be physical death. It can be emotional death. Can be financial death. Praise the Lord. Sometimes you mismanage your finances. Maybe you're doing business or at home or whichever place and at the end of it all together your business dies. That will be financial death. There's also a relationship there. When you neglect the way of true marriage, praise the Lord. And you maybe take your own way, that which lives into death, even your relationship would die. Praise the Lord. There's also spiritual death. When you neglect your spiritual work with the Lord, automatically you can die. Praise the Lord. And when you die, you go to hell. Praise the Lord. Even your ministry can die. If you become so proud, but I'm the only one who can do it. Praise the Lord. For in the Bible, in the book of Isaiah, we are going to read something. I mean, from the book of Numbers, I'm going to share about somebody there. I mean the number of people who claimed that they knew more at the end of it all together they died all. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Our ways are always different from God's way. How we do things is different from the way God has been. Praise the Lord for the book of Isaiah 55 verse 89. Isaiah 55 verse 8 and 9. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Isaiah chapter 55 vers 8 and 9. Praise the Lord. Let us read it in the name of the Lord. says that for my souls are not your souls neither are your ways my ways says the Lord. Then verse 9 says that for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my souls than your souls. Praise the Lord. [Music] [Music] Praise the Lord. Man's ways are always concentrated within sin. The nature of man's ways is always concentrated within sin. If you decide to take your own way, not in the will of God, The end of it all together is death. Praise the Lord. And the man decides his own way. In many ways it leads to death. Those ways that we have counted the the death ways that we have counted. Praise the Lord. And without God, our ways are always invalid. They cannot work out completely. And our ways don't prosper at all. Our ways cannot stand test of time. How many times you can try to pretend in one way or the other. But I want you to give it time when a trial time comes. It's always hard for our ways to stand up. Praise the Lord. And that's when you know the true colors of a person. He has been a thief in a company. It will be identical. They will identify it because his ways or her ways cannot stand the test of time. Praise the Lord. For they have a limited time when they will expire. Praise the Lord. And we keep sometimes promising ourselves that we can do it on our own. But I want you brother, sister, you can't do it on your own. Never. No one has ever done on his own. Or if Moses was to rise up and I want to go and bring the children of Israel out, he would do not make it because in the beginning he fa to go to train him in order for him to succeed. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You cannot do it on your own. It takes the Lord with you. Brother sister, all man's ways which are created lead to sin. Praise the Lord. Because in most cases, God is not inclusive. In most cases, God is taken out. But when you try to do it on your own, you'll go to death. Praise the Lord. So this men were going to talk in the Bible their ways and how it led them to death. All these people seemed all these people seemed all had a relationship with God's children. All had a relationship with God's children but decided to go their own way and they ended up into death. Just like we can look at King Ahab's wife. She had a some relationship with the children of God because she was married to the king. But the ones that she chose at the end of it all the le. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Then after briefly in conclusion we are going to look into the ways that lead to life eternal. and that life eternal. Praise the Lord. I hope you are together. Are we together? Praise the Lord. So Moses who had a great relationship with God also had a great leadership which faced many obstacles and it was tested the greatest trial in his leadership. Praise the Lord. But we are going to talk about the rebellion of Kora. Not about even others. The Bible begins in the book of Numbers chapter 16 verse one. We can read a little number 16 verse one. Maybe the brother will translate this one straight. Amen. So that we can save time. Chapter 16 verse1 the Bible says the son of isar the son of the son of David and the sons of and the son of son of took men says that And they rose up before Moses with a certain of children of Israel, 250 princes of the assembly, famous men in the congregation, men of renown, and they gathered themselves together against Moses, against Aaron, and said unto them, "Yeah, take too much upon yourself, upon you, yet take too much upon you. Seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, the Lord is among them. The Lord is among them. Praise the Lord. Are you getting me? Praise the Lord. Maybe let me repeat verse three. And they gather themselves against Moses against and said unto them, "Yeah, take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Wherefore he lift up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord." Praise the Lord. And when Moses had it, he fell upon his face. He had take too much upon yourself. This is what the famous man famous men said. The men among them was Kora and they gather themselves against Moses that you take too much upon yourself. All the congregation is holy. Why do you say then that we are the only one to talk to God? Praise the Lord. These men started speaking but like they loved God. But indeed they wanted to worship God but they had a bad intention. Praise the Lord. And when you follow closely this ways they are ways led into death. Praise the Lord. For they said for they said they began like they supported justice Roman's attention. Mark this man and Mark this man did not say the congregation was of Satan but they said it was of the Lord. Praise the Lord. This man wanted the attention of other people like these people are speaking good. You see speaking the name of the Lord. You see they are just the same as like us. Why don't we join up together with them? This Moses all the time. He said that he's the only one that talk to God. That is a bit impossible. Let us guide ourselves and indeed they rose up against Moses. But always God's servants. They always simple and easy. They don't rush to do things. They take in accordance to the leadership of God. thing Moses did. The first thing Moses did, it fell upon his face. Praise the Lord. Verse four say so. When Moses heard it, he fell upon his face. And he spoke unto Kora and all unto his company saying even tomorrow the Lord will show who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him. Even him whom he had chosen when he to come near unto him. Then he gave him instructions. This do take C scissors and all his company and put fire there in and put incense in them before the Lord tomorrow and it shall be that the man whom the Lord do choose it shall be holy. He take too much upon upon you. [Music] says of Levy, and Moses said unto Kora, "Here I pray you, sons of Levy, eat but a small thing unto you, that the Lord of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord. stand before a congregation and minister unto them. It is seem like it was it seemed like but I it seem like these people here they had their own assumption of doing things. They decided to do things outside the will of God and they decided to gather themselves because Moses was speaking unto them. My brothers, even the Lord has appointed you. You are serving the tabernacle of God. Why have you decided to rise up or just like that? Praise the Lord. They decided on their own because the devil was leading them. Praise the Lord. Do not be of that kind. I pray thee, brother. We are going to read from this quote. The God who rich in mercy preaching 1965 we are going to read it partularly paragraph 77. It says that we could say the same thing about Kora and they are gang of unbelieving people as they try to impersonate they try to inflict something into God's program was that they could serve the people in the tabernacle but for them they decided to bring out their own program have not spoken to any of them but I just had an idea how can Moses say him alone him alone all the time why not even in fact I say all the congregation is holy everyone is free to talk to God and I didn't like a one month's program I didn't like that they had to have something to do said, "Why there is more holy men than you?" Praise the Lord. These people had more to say, not just the congression is holy. They said that you are holier than Moses. Act like you are the only on on on own and the only people on the beach and said you owe not to do that and there's more men here. And Moses known that he was to carry those children over into the promised land. The promised land was given unto him and he must pack them to the promised land. And today the only the Holy Spirit is here to vindicate God's word. And that is the eagle's wing. And we are supposed to ride on not some manmade se. But we are to ride upon the wings of the king to the promised land. Then paragraph 8 say 8 was going to get a bit of a bunch of chicken out there you know come around impersonate this eagle and they did it God said separate yourself from them and he swallowed up the world swallowed up the whole thing the ation. But God rich in mercy. Those who are trying to follow this word always God rich in mercy. Many of them come over come over on the on the side with Moses and God opened up the ark and swallowed up the unbeliever. Praise the Lord. And the same praise the Lord, brother. Praise the Lord. The same can happen today if you remain an unbeliever. There will come a time where there will be no grace. There will be no mercy. And what else? It will be the way of death. You will die. You will perish. Praise the Lord. And those who did not believe. Lord, I come out and walk for a while. But they Jesus said they they are everyone dead. Death is anhilation they are dead. Just think of that. Think of them. I mean they come out in the miracles of God in the grand hand of God. They enjoy the manner. He got out there and listened to a man named Praise the Lord that perverted the way of God by his teaching contrary to the word of God and all brethren. So let's just be together. That is the spirit that had we just the same. We are just the same. We can do things together. We are just the same. We can enjoy things together. Now the story that I gave you at first about the three friends they used to move together but their spiritual state all of them even the one claim to be a Christian even him never had Christ in him. So these people the way they were moving together I'm very sure they were saying we are together we are one people there's no need of criticizing the other only preaching against the other. Even the born again said I will also keep quiet. The Muslim say I will not speak about Islamic but the one who claimed that God does not exist could have spoken more and could have said we are together. Let's let's move together. Let's do things together because these people always in that street. They like moving together. Whenever they call them for work, you see them moving together. I don't know why do they discuss all the time. Praise the Lord. None of them had anything which was good. They have all decided to take the sin. I keep praying for them. May the Lord be merciful to them. Then verse uh chapter I mean paragraphs 82 says there is another balam system rising up today let's all get together it will not work let's work with the eagle eagle you are eagleise praise the lord there is only three saved out of the entire group Moses and Joshua. The rest of them perished. Jesus said so in St. John chapter 6. God in mercy would not let them perish because with the rest of the unbelievers, they all died right there in the wilderness and they are dead. God saved Moses and the eagle believers because that they had respect to the his word. all follow the word of God. The unbelievers, the company of Kora, the company of Dan and all 120 elders, all those who gathered against Moses, all the people tested of goodness all everything that God had given to the congregation. When there was time of hunger, when food was given, All of them ate from it. When they needed water, all of them had from they drank it. Praise the Lord. They saw how Moses spoke to God. So whatever Moses spoke out came to pass. I keep wondering how they from nowhere rise up and say Moses you claim too much for yourself too much for yourself. Even as we are holy, we can also speak to God. Praise the Lord. After all that time, the other day we are sharing the in home sale. We are sharing about a report how Moses sent the children of Israel to spy the land at the point and then after they came back all of them had different reports. Joshua and had a different report. The rest of the children who who were sent also had a report but their report was evil. Because the Bible says so Paul discoura the children of God because they say we are just like grasshoppers people are giants we cannot fight them we are just like grasshoppers honestly you are brother sister looking at the things happening in the world maybe sometimes you sleep hungry on self that this world is so hard that you're a child of God. Thank God rose up and he said, "We are more than able. Let's go up at one. They were more than able because they trusted on the Lord at they didn't dwell on their own ways. look at their own strength. They don't look at their own things that they had the hammer that they had. They only depended on the Lord. The Lord could deliver them. Praise the Lord. But this one from now rising up, I'm also holy. Is holy brother. Why only you always And you are the one leading us. Praise the Lord. That was an evil spirit in there. That brother or sister, you should not entertain it. Evil spirit that will rise up and even has risen up. Praise the Lord. They are trying to do all whatever they can saying that brother was not a prophet. All the other say so other one will say another thing will say another one that how comes only him messenger I'm also messenger I receive from God bring it for God praise the Lord but I want tell you in our age only one prophet only one was sent not two not three not many but only We ought to follow the message of the heart that will lead us to life and then you rise up and stand against it. You go to YouTube, you go to Tik Tok, you go to all other platforms and start posting why I left a message to begin with. You are not a message yourself. You are not converted. That's why you couldn't bear it. The true word of God is done with that because it was sent by God. Praise the Lord. For Kora decided away. Not only you even us can do it. I wanted the end of it all together. The people died. They couldn't survive. They had no way of surviving. For others were swallowed up. others a plague he came and took them. You know it is so funny these people here they couldn't learn from a first thing which happened after the heart has swallowed others after others were swallowed up they could have woken up and said you see what has happened we should wake up let's serve the go of Moses but the people continue resisting but not only you Moses but at the end of it all together Even them died. Praise the Lord. Let's follow the ways of the Lord. Praise the Lord. For God has done a lot of things for us that we cannot turn back anymore. For God has saved you. We cannot turn back anymore. For those of the God who delivered them when they reached the Red Sea, they had nowhere to go through. They had no way through and God came through Moses put the word and it was acted. Moses and Aaron working together. This happened and these are the men they stood against who brought the true message to them. The man who came and preached the good news to them who went and brought them out of the land. They forgot all those things. Praise the Lord. and they decided to rebel against us. It was in the wilderness. It was in the wilderness where they rebel against me. For us today, we are in this world. Let's not rebel against the message. Praise the Lord because we journey on the journey to the promised land. Let's not stand against his word. Let us stand with it that we may have that promised land. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And today, friend, the only way that we can ever have favor with God in mercy, then we have got to respect what is said about it. You just can't take talk about take about somebody else said or what somebody said. You have got to take what God say. If these people who died with the of could only go and reason within themselves but how could he believe what is saying imagine saying that all is saying that he's only one who's holy if they could go and reason within themselves or if they could go and pray about it reasoning could come normal because they were one they just accepted it. Perhaps they had those of had a campaign. They had a small movement within themselves in the camp that they were living in. Perhaps they were moving from house to house to whisper to those people. But how comes you see Moses is saying that him alone? How do you see that thing? Then get your same spirit in that person. I've been seeing Even me I've been thinking about this. It is very true. How can Moses say him alone? Now they become two. They continued moving looking from home to home until the number became big. They saw that we cannot conquer Moses. They rose up and they rose up and imagine Kora was Moses cousin. They were cousins. He rose up against Moses. told Moses, "Not only you, but even us." Praise the Lord. Uh in the message, who do you say this is? Just a brief one. They followed him, but they arose up in the wilderness, one by the name of Dan and one by the name of Kora. And they said, "This has got to be a one-man affair. Moses thinks he's the only one God's called. The one message, the one message, they didn't want it. No, they didn't want it. And God never did deal deal with but with one person at a time. One man, one message. Praise the Lord. It is always one man, one message. You cannot say that even I have a message. Honestly, a person like me rising up. I have a message. People follow me and I start creating my own ways. Follow me. That way will lead to death. Praise the Lord. All those ways lead to death. But there is another way. There is another way and that is the way of a Bible. The way of a true message. If there is a way which lead to death, let us leave aside. There's a way that of a Bible which leads to death. I mean which leads to life. The way of the cross for the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross and that is the way of true life. But he died on the cross that our sins may be forgiven and that is the way we ought to follow 53. Isaiah 53. Let us read something from there. So that we can end on the right time. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Isaiah chapter 5. Isaiah chapter 53. We are going to read from verse three up to verse 10. The Bible says he is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and and we esteemed him not. Surely he has bore our grief and carried our sorrows. Yet we didn't we did esteem him stricken smiten of God and afflicted and he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities tment of our peace upon him and with his stripes we are healed. All we are like sheep have gone astray. who have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and he was afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth. He is brought as an a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before a shara is lamb openth not his mouth. He was taken from prison. He was taken from prison and from judgment. And who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off of the land of the living. For the transgression of my people, my people was his stricken. And and he made his grave with a wicked and with a rich in his death because he has done no violence. Neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord, Bruce him. He has put him to grief. When those shall shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his land. Praise the Lord. That is the way of a cross. That is the way we ought to follow. Where the Lord died for our sins. He was stuck in a sinful man simply because we could be saved. It seemed like he's the one who did it simply because he wanted to save us. Praise the Lord. That is the way of life. The way which gave us life. There's another way. That's the way of repentance where you sincerely commit your ways to the Lord. That is the way which lives life as they are only way led to death. But here there's a true repentance. I just go to God and the spirit of pride which is rising up in me. God forgive me. God had repented that way that I'm I'm God. I'm feeling it in me. He's so proud. I'm feeling like it's all Moses. But for him, he went and told people that to be the only ones. But I want a way of true repentance and that is the way of the Lord Jesus Christ. There's a way of true baptism and true baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is a way which leads to life. There's a way of true obedience. Where he leads me, I will follow. When he tells me to do this, I do it. When he speaks to me in his word, I receive it and say amen to it. Because it is a way of life. That is the way of a Christian. That is why a Christian ought to live, not the way which leads to death. Praise the Lord. There's a true way of marriage. Not just moving left, right. Seek for the marriage in your own ways. This is the true way of marriage. But for you say, no pastor. I want this way which is right in your own way. You can manipulate the church. You can manipulate people. You can seek that people will not know. No one will not no one will know it. But I want you the Lord knoweth it. The Lord watches it. But there's an eye which watches you day and night. When you're in a most place when you are alone, eye is watching you. Who is watching you even in your bedroom is watching wherever you go. Even when you look left, right, see that there's no brother. I think I can speak a little. Praise the Lord. I can take a little alcohol. I can do some relationship a little. And you say, I've stayed here for about one time. There's no believer here. I can also get a girlfriend. Praise the Lord. Those are the words which lead to death. As long as you take them, they will lead to the way of death. Praise the Lord. There must be true godship. There must be true marriage. And that is the way of the Bible. Not doing things on your own. You must seek the leadership of God. The way of true and sweet fellowship. That sweet fellowship that you feel the presence of God coming down. man fellowship like this boy here who said he's a Christian for him to work in church is to dance to preach the word of God so I don't have time to preach to these people as decide but I want to tell you there's a way of true and sweet fellowship that is what the Bible says John 4:2 the Bible said but the hour cometh No is is when the true worshippers worship the father in spirit and in truth. It must be in the spirit and in the truth. Praise the Lord. You may claim that I'm woring the spirit, but it may not be true. Pentecost will claim it around making some weird noise. But they say that we're in the spirit. But I want to they are not in the spirit. They had a false spirit aloud. One time I had an encounter when I went to visit some home. My sister took me there. So when we reach home, I didn't know that this home has a church. The home compound, they decided to put a church there. So we entered to the sting room. We got all people had gone to church. All people had gone to church. So only one person was left in the house was ready to welcome us. Then my sister said, "Oh, we are going let's go to church." I said, "That's right. Let's go to church." So we went to church. So when we reach church, a lot of things were happening there. People were in different categories. The prophets on their own. Then a certain lady came to me. Who are you? An inter intercessor. Oh, which group do you belong? I was confused. I said where do I belong now? I thought maybe I was because I was behind. I thought maybe being among the common people. I didn't know even behind people also had a role and for them they were intercessors. Then they saying who are you? I didn't have a word to say. They told me go in front there. Praise the Lord. They knew that I was among the people who came for prayers. I didn't know where I belong. But they told me go in front there. I went and stood. I told him no. Sit down there. Praise the Lord. And there was a cycle of people. Even my sister was already among them. I was wondering how did she reach there. How did she reach there? So they told me sit down with pressure. So I sat down among the group of people among the circle. So as we seated those ones who were prophets, they started prophesying. They started praying for people. I was really ignorant of what was happening. How did I find myself? I was so confused. I didn't know what to do. I like running away. But I was surrounded all over. And if you try to run away, catch you as the spirit of people away. How am I going to escape from here? I just say, God, I commit my spirit to you. I have nothing that I can do. I'm in a trap. I don't know how I came here. I've been caught here. Lord, take my spirit. Help me, Lord. Now, these ladies started their work. They started pressing people's heads, pressing the body while others are washing the body. Now they were about to reach me. And I had my school fees in the pocket. People were pouring a lot of water. I was wondering whom am I going to give my school? I had a lot of notes in the pocket. I was wondering who am I going to give? There was no one. Everyone was busy in his department. I said God how much I decided to hide man a little down so that maybe water will not affect then they reached my part they told me okay they didn't say anything but I started speaking out words was pressing my head she was pressing out demons to me the lord then another one said on the legs one ran to the legs while they said to the legs another one to the legs pressing the legs while others are pouring water they pouring on the head all the shirt is wet was happening I said god I'm mercy how did I come here so these ladies were doing the all this short skirts they tried to do some covering of their skirts because their work was 2000 time they got busy the covering they had fell down. So they remain with all their short skirts trying to prophesy. So they finish on me. Then I reach on my sister. I said God help my sister. But my sister had a small belief on these people. So far she was okay with it. I didn't have it. Praise the Lord. So after all the prayers they did for all. Now the prophecies came from the main prophet. They called me in front. Please come over here. They call me in front. You come in front here. So we are going to tell you what the Lord says for you. You're a good child. But there are demons which vis you every night and you always see them. They come as bats and they come flying over you. Those are demons sent away your future. Praise the Lord. I was now quiet. I didn't say a word. They said again, your stomach always pains all the time like pain. Is it true? He said, "My stomach has taken almost a year without pain." I remember I said I was honest to myself. I was honest. The person who was next to me was trying to knock me say yes. Yes. I said no. I don't feel stomach ache. I don't even when I'm sleeping. I always sleep well and I wake up well. All those things you speaking about, I don't know. It was a burden to these people. It disturbed them. They were not settled. So I challenged them. They lost the moral of speaking about other people. They couldn't speak about others because I felt defeated. Praise the Lord. So immediately when I left that place, I ran home and pastor I believe some of you know pastor. He was staying in senior quarters. Senior senior quarters. So I ran very fast. I ran home because at the place I know as home I climbed the stairs. I went up where they stayed. They were staying the flat and I got mommy's wife in the house. I said mommy pray for me. I am finished. Pray for me mommy. They saw my body was wet. The shirt is wet. You're wondering what happened. I said today I fell into a trap. These people took me. I didn't know what to say. Praise the Lord. Those are the ways which lead to death. For as long as you follow them, they always lead to death. People creating their own atmosphere of God present. They behave like God is present. They act like God is present. Like they worshiping God in the spirit. Here they are not they trying to speak in tones and on tones without interpretation they spoke a lot no interpretation even afterwards they didn't tell us what they meant I remember even that very day after prayers they were now worshiping they were praising God I saw the brothers and the sisters dancing and they reach a point they were excited I saw them carrying each other on the A sister is carrying a brother but they are not married. They are not married. That is the spirit of God moving. When the prophets said as they were worshiping, God is saying to the all the prophets, pray for one another, pray for one another. So they have to catch up with one another. Two two. If you find a man, that is the one you pray with. Find a woman, that's the one you pray with. So the most of them for them found themselves they were with a woman and a man things were happening. I'm wondering that God have mercy the world is lost. The way they were acting the way they behaving a man said the Holy Spirit is telling him massage a lady. So he started doing it. The Holy Spirit is saying carry on your back. Put on your back. I said what's happening? A lot was happening. The generation of evildoers claiming to worship God yet they are not worshiping God claiming to be in the spirit yet they are not in the spirit. Up to today when I go to that home I don't look the same. For me these days I go in a different spirit. I tell them that the spirit that I have is not as a spirit that you have. So now they take me as a reject in their home. Even when I visit them sometimes I feel like I'm I'm not like welcomed because I am quite different from them. Praise the Lord. I really accept to be different from them because I found the truth. Praise the Lord. Our founder will accept me free. Praise the Lord. The way of fivefold ministry. Everyone fit into his right place. Not a brother struggling to be like brother putting yourself into a position which the Lord has put in the church. That is a true way of the Lord. That's the true way of the Bible. Praise the Lord. We ought to move in a true way and the true way is in the way of the Lord and worship the Lord in the spirit and in the truth. We ought to be obedient to the word of God, following what he says and doing what he says. When he tells us go here to do it, just do it in simplicity and the Lord will always help you. Try tell someone about the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the true way of the Lord and the true of the Bible follow because at one time even me I didn't follow that way. I was following the way of the world. I was following the way of Catholism. I just love to go to church and I could just sing. I could just come back the normal way I was. Nothing happened. Everything continued. When the sister comes and teaches you about to praying the rosary bits, everything was going on like that. But there was no change. And when I found a true way, I found life. Praise the Lord. Because the true way will take us to heaven. The true way will make us make us meet our Lord Jesus Christ. The true way will give you true marriage if you want it. The true way will give you a job. The true way will bring your Holy Spirit down into your heart. And that is a true way that we ought to follow. Now we can go back to the other story. And there is a word that seem right until the man. But at the end of it all together, it leads to death. Now if it leads to death, there must be another way which leads to life and that is the way of the lord. God bless you. Let's pray. Dear father in heaven say thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy for your kindness Lord that you loved us before the world and you predestinated us oh Lord. Now we are here as your children. We commit our ways unto you. Let them be the ways of the Lord. Not the ways of not the ways which lead to death but voices which lead to life and life eternal. Lord come down. Visit each and every one of us in our places of work in our places of stay where we sleep. Lord Jesus Christ the way that we take the be Lord Jesus Christ. We pray Lord always be in our leadership. Help us oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lead us oh Lord. Father give us your ways oh Lord. The way of true repentance oh alone. The way of genuine fellowship alone. The way of true repentance alone. The way which will take us to heaven. When we all get unto heaven we shall sing glory and glory for the Lord is good because you have given us a true way. Father I want to say thank you. good and you're wonderful in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. We shall sing this song as brother Martin comes.

And Lord, you say that Lord, if we don't want correction that we then we are reprobate, Lord, but you say thy sheep hears thy voice and they cannot follow the voice of the stranger. Lord Jesus, it's because you are yours. That's why thou has corrected us this evening. Forgive us, Lord, where we have been in our own ways. We ask you to forgive us and bring us back to the right path. You said in Jeremiah that go stand at the junction and ask for that old way and walk therein and thy soul shall find rest.
