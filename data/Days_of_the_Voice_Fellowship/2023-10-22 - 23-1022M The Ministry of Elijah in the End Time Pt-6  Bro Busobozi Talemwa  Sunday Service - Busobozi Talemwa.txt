of you who went you did let's do all that we can especially when someone wants to marry the right way marriage is a good thing and whenever someone or one of us is going to marry uh sister or brother we should do all that we can in our ability to to support them so we are behind you in prayers brother Andrew and we believe that the Lord will give you success praise God uh so I have just a few

Victor brother Victor and I have become best of friends have so much in common his uh we went we had not planned it but Pastor Le heard about him really desired that we also take him to Miana so we

the dead and he is Lord every KN every shall B every Jesus Christ just before we read the scripture i' just like us to just close our eyes for just a moment this is the moment where we just ask the Lord to come and speak to us through his [Music] word as we just meditate about our lives commit ourselves to him it's not about a preacher coming on the pulit to speak to you it's about Lord coming down to speak to all of us because we are in need spiritual needs physical needs but our God can answer all our needs and so at this moment I want you to believe with me just before we commit oursel for him to speak to us that he will inspire all of us to be able to hear and receive what he has for [Music] us hallelujah hallelujah oh yes wow let everything within in me Christ Jesus let everything within me Christ Jesus as a prayer to him this morning of Child [Music] Jesus Jesus Jesus he the L that was slain everybody s with me now let everything within me Christ Jesus Christ [Music] Jesus let everything within me Christ Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus is the Lamb that was slain I just want to do it one more time that everything within me let everything within me cry Jesus whatever you need is just cry out to him let everything within me Let It cry cry Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus is the love that was name we are here because of you [Music] Lord you are slain for our sin if it had not been for Calvary if it had not been for that Old Rugged Cross where would we be today and Father we are so grateful this morning because you have called us the purchase of your blood [Music] we are the reason why you went on that cross some may believe it is just a story but we believe it is a reality because we've seen change our lives this is our sustaining power Lord we are so grateful this morning because of the Cross we are so grateful this morning because of the L that for our Lord and now father Lord as I would even now open the pages of your holy word may you bless each and every listener this morning for this Congregation of people have not come to congregate just around themselves but unto you Jesus reveal word of the day s known to each individual father give Revelation to each individual give understanding to each person father that we may know such things as you want us to have in our in this hour day bless your name Lord bless the reading of your word in the precious name of Jesus Christ and everybody say amen amen while you still standing please stand with me to the Book of Malachi chapter [Music] 4 God thank you musicians that will be all the singing for for today [Music] so just uh taking from verses one so the service today the Lord willing will be a teaching service service I the Lord willing because I'm not that much of a teacher but just to get a few Basics and uh of our foundational uh truths here in the Bible that I desire that we share together with you we read from verse one so I appreciate if you can if you have a pen and maybe you have a question just write it down and then after the service we can always you know you can always approach me and we can go through those so we are reading from verse one behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be tble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root no Branch so this day is coming and it is coming because God said it is coming so you better believe it is coming whether you believe it or not it is coming anyway how many believe that day is coming that means we should prepare ourselves unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he shall go forth and grow up as calves of the store and ye shall trade down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of [Music] HS remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you may be seated God bless you and bless the reading of your word so we have been dealing with the subject of the ministry of Elijah in the end time and I think that this is a part six but really most of all the other parts we've been looking at the ministry of Elijah itself in the beginning [Music] so I am requesting that you kindly give me your undivided attention try to uh minimize movement as much as possible so that the the thought which will not be so long can be projected to you properly after the service we are going to have a um a meeting with the committee members for the Youth uh uh our youth meetings and I know I'm also meeting a few people for cancer so I will not delay in so I just want us to be together one mind don't do on me don't sleep on me and just have your Bible handy how many have this book how many need it okay so everybody has I hope everybody has so this is a a little booklet we have been uh Distributing for some time now around the country it's called the five comings of Elijah just 17 pages everyone can read it in less than one hour even the poor reader if you're very very very poor reader maybe in two hours Maxim if you're a good reader in just 15 to 30 minutes you'll be done just very few pages really like a track about the five comings of Elijah and so brother Tim wrote this book and I had also um recorded a video the five comings of elij and I was thinking of putting it into book format and I noticed by the team put had already written this so I I I asked him to give it to me so we also translated it into ruganda and it's been going around the whole country there are many who even don't know this message that I've received this little booklet really much of this teaching on Elijah's Ministry you will find it in this book with all the scriptures all the explanations so you can clearly understand uh and for you who are not good at reading and just want to listen we have a video recorded on that as well I think I also um we did it in Ethiopia in Amar also with we did one here with the luganda version should be on our Channel of the on the YouTube on the days of the voice channel so YouTube what I'm trying to say is when we come in the church sometimes you preach things and you think everybody has understood but not usually I've learned over the years not everybody understands everything you're saying so you have to keep repeating it repeating it and repeating it and sometimes I've noticed you also need to uh put it in small bits and pieces where people can be able to break it down and understand it so that's why we have those videos we have and many forms where people can be able to understand and really be able to to be helped to study this in the Bible fully are fully Bible Church where every teaching we teach is based on the scriptures and we believe that the scriptures are enough for our salvation and it is in the scriptures that we learn about the ministry of Elijah and we notice that the ministry as we have come as we have been seeing for now about six services the ministry of Elijah uh did not only work at the time of Elijah when he was on Earth it is also going to work in it is Promised or prophesied to work in the end time also but there is only one man that came that was called Elijah and we have started his ministry or gone through his ministry these past Services we have seen everything Elijah did from pronouncing a drought you know to feeding you know to being fed by Ravens and and the Ang of the Lord you know providing flour and and oil to the woman all these were Supernatural occur occurrences in his ministry you know he slaughtered the prophets of B when he took them to The Showdown to prove for them to prove whether their God was the true one or whether his God was the right one and he said the god that will answer by fire and consume the sacrifice will be the right the right God their God was silent they prophesied they cut themselves they jumped up and down they shouted but their God was silent so it is from that we learn it's not about the shouting the dancing all that kind of thing it's about having the principles right so the god of Elijah is about is the god of restoration of the principle of God of the principles of the word the god of Elijah puts everything in order and then when he calls the fire fire comes down not because Elijah called the fire but because the time was right it was the time of the evening which was the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice and then the altar which was messed up initially was also prepared properly by Elijah and then now we can call God and when God comes down you know he has to prove that he's with Elijah and you see the other prophets of Bal were ashamed and Elijah slaughtered all of them you know because their God was not and we also notic he prayed and Rain came down and we also notice that he prayed and rain stop for three and a half years my God I love the the god of Elijah because the god of Elijah is the god of [Music] action is the god of action not the god of words the god of action he makes things happen so he said it will not rain and it did not rain for three years let me tell you that is power to bind just like Jesus said in the Book of Matthew that whatsoever you will bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you lose on Earth shall be loed in heaven so Elijah had power to bind and Elijah had power to lose are you following me so we also notice that he prophesied the death of Jezebel Jezebel was a prophet who had lifted herself above the word of God but Elijah prophesied that she would die and Elijah went on he did many things we can see that his ministry was a powerful Ministry and actually if you compare him with all the prophets of the Old Testament he had an outstanding Ministry you know he raised a dead child back to life you know you know I can go on and on and on talking about his is many exploits so let me put it this way the god of Elijah is a god of restoration the god of Elijah is a god of life is a God who prepares things and brings back life where there has been death you know and also life was restored where death abounds the only thing that was required after Elijah had set everything in order was for him to speak for yes was for him to speak and and at the sounding of his voice God came down are you following me now in the times of course we we have also been able to look at the times when Elijah came it was a time when Ahab was the king of Israel and notice that at that time Israel had been divided already and and Ahab went after other gods just like the other kings before him and God displeased go because he went and married an unbeliever actually he married a PRI a a priest's [Music] daughter a priest who believed a priest of B his name was and he expected that you know he would still worship His God but because he married the PRI of daughter of an unbeliever he ended up sanctioning the building of the temples of B in Israel that if you marry an unbeliever there is no way you can worship the true God and that's why Believers always matter [Music] Believers we are the younger men can we say Amen to that only the the young ladies is that a young lady Believers always Mar [Music] Believers because if you don't do that you end up worshiping other gods now these other people were serving their God and they thought their God was a living God I want to ask you question why do you think these people were ready to go for on a showdown with Elijah do you think they doubted their gods they actually believed their God they believe their God will answer with fire maybe in the past they had seen their gods do something for them but you see I want to tell you when we preach when we talk about the message when we talk about the end time message and we said the end time message is the right truth is the truth it does not mean that God is Not elsewhere no please I want you to hear me clearly it does not mean God is Not elsewhere God is everywhere and some of these people pray some of them have gifts some of them they have seen God work for them and there's no way you can prove to them that what they have is not the truth but listen to me when Elijah comes on the scene he does not come to debate with anybody because for him is a prophet not just somebody with a gift of Prophecy but he is a prophet do you know the difference between a prophet and somebody with a gift of Prophecy somebody who has a gift of Prophecy can tell a few prophecies and he may never tell them again he may never prophesy again or he can you know some of the prophets may even fail but let me tell you when we come to a prophet he is born a prophet he is a prophet from the time he's in his mother's womb and when he comes on the seene not one of his prophecies can fail why because he's born a prophet so even if they reject him his prophecy still holds now Elijah was rejected he came to a place where he even went and started crying he said Lord I'm left alone left alone everybody has gone toship but God told him no elah that's not true there are others 7,000 who have not bowed and need to Bow and there was a prophet I think H uh his name was called um uh what what is the name of this Prophet uh I think it was what it did he was just very busy hiding the prophets of God hiding them in caves and Elijah never knew about them so listen Elijah was one one man in the hands of God there were other true prophets but God used only one man Elijah for a Ministry of restoration one man in a generation and he stood he was one man versus all the prophets Ministry never failed and wherever it was received his ministry brought Prosperity are you following me now wherever the Min of Elijah went and was accepted Prosperity followed where there was death life came on the where there was no food food was provided where there was no hope Hope was restored now that is the ministry of Elijah the ministry of Elijah brings healing the healing of God on his wings follow me closely here just trying to lay foundation for you so now Elijah was rejected and uh at the end of his ministry everything he said happened Jezebel died and until you know he he spoke rain never came he was a prophet of God and now that is the Old Testament so in the portion of scripture where we have read today there is a another prophecy for Behold a day come that shall burn as anen and all the proud and all that do wickedly shall be and the day that come shall bur them up say the Lord of host I want you to understand that the prophecy here is speaking of the end time let me ask you a question the day that is the day that shall burn as an oven has it come yet so it has not yet come now this prophecy was given by Prophet Mal and it is the last book in the oldest and you know prophets when they prophesy they don't speak on their own they speak according to what God has told them was see the day is coming over I want to say that day is coming still if the prophet Mal saw it I want to say it must happen tell your neighbor it must happen it must happen it must happen because God said so the day of judgment must happen and the day when we say the day of judgment the day the judgments of God they don't begin only on the last white Throne judgment the day of Judgment of God really listen to me begin after the Rapture because after the Rapture of the Church of the Bride there comes a tribulation the tribulation is not an easy time it's not a good time people who will remain here they will suffer call that the judgments of God it will be a time of tribulation and then we know that the Bible says all that do wicked shall be stubble that day shall burn them up and we know that there is coming what we call the third world war are you hearing what is happening today in in Israel you know some people think that these things are just happening everything is in Prophecy we are standing in a place where prophecy is being fulfilled in our very eyes the world order as it is is right here in the Bible and the world order as it is going to be to become is right here in the Bible and our place as Sons and Daughters of God is right here in the scripture until you understand the Prophecies of the world you cannot be able to place yourself in the scripture and to know where are you standing are we just you know worshiping a God we do not know and we are going to die and go to a place where we don't know no listen the Bible speaks about dimensions you know yesterday one young man was asking me seven dimensions and those dimensions are real when you die today there is a place where you are going did you know that if you die in Christ you are going to a good place we call it Heaven oh you want to call it Paradise whatever you want to call it but that place is a dimension where your soul [Music] go people think some people thought that oh when someone dies it goes to where Jesus is no everybody who died in Christ has never actually seen Jesus never they waiting just like you are waiting that day is coming when we shall see Jesus with our very eyes in the book of First Thessalonians chapter 4 since I'm teaching you these things I need to read it for quickly open there I always refer to it but I don't read it chapter 4 says verse 13 I would not not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise fast then we which are alive and remain shall be CAU up together with them in the clouds to meet with the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord [Music] for amen so there are two groups here the first group are those who have have died in Christ can you do you have some examples of those Abraham who else John PA Peter well Mary those are in the Bible do you have examples that you know today there are some of those who died so you are sure of those in the Bible your family members and your friends all those that died in Christ that believe the word of their they are in that place together they in one place together they w to resurrect now the Bible says three things will happen there will be a shout a voice and a trumpet now I'll not explain it because of time but he says that the sounding of the Trump because it's the last thing to sound what is going to happen the dead in Christ will rise up again by the way do you believe that this is not a or a story listen to me chch this is not a bedtime story this is a Bible prophecy the dead in Christ shall rise so what are we waiting for we are waiting for them to rise up they are going to resurrect we are going to see them they must right now which forms of body are they in they are now in another form of body in the dimension which they in they have to come up here and pick up another form of body here on Earth because you see right now right now we are having this form of body but this is not the form of body we are going to go with Resurrection the Bible says even us we shall be changed our bodies shall be Quicken which means this is not the body going in the rapt they have acted movies on how the Rapture is going to happen but many of them have it wrong you see they think it's just going to be a change that is happening one day the change is already going on now the change is happening right now what will when the trumpet of the Lord sounds the day Christ shall rise it will be the climax of a change that has been going on in us for ages and ages that's why we sing that song I've Been Changed I've been reborn all my life have been rearranged so now those who have been changed will meet together with those that died in Christ and rose again and then they will meet together you will see them and they will see you you tell God bless you so you also made Hallelujah you the message ofation you you will be able to discuss those things and then finally the Bible says together we shall go and meet the Lord that is going to happen that is what we believe tell your neighbor That's What We believe We believe that we believe the resurrection We Believe the change of our B that is going to happen Hallelujah well if you don't believe it wait until it happens because if you don't believe it it will still happen and you will be here on Earth and you will recognize it has already happened and you are left behind but I don't want to be left behind what is going to happen so important that God has said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet why is God sending Elijah the prophet he's sending him so that the people can be ready for what is going to happen are you following me now all right so I want you to look at uh at at that verse again in vers okay I'll just skip that let's just go to verse five behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord praise the name of the Lord now here church is speaking about the two comings of Jesus Christ he is speaking of his first coming and speaking of his second coming the first coming of Jesus was great why because the savior of the world came he came to die he came to give himself he came to bring Grace so it was great but was it Dreadful I ask you was it you can say it was Dreadful why it was not Dreadful because he did not come to bring judgment he did not come to bring Vengeance came to bring Salvation so now you remember I think the last service I did some illustration here of the first coming of Jesus and the second coming of Jesus and uh maybe I'm trying to see how to avoid that but I think I have to do it again today so that you can sink in I'd like to have four young people if you can come up and help me to illustrate this amen I know you don't want to be put on the spot but if you can please come and help out Isaiah 43 as the brothers are coming up thank you Brothers God bless you so now I want to show you something here if you can come this side extend side yeah yeah so now here is the first coming of Jesus and this is the second coming of Jesus it was prophesied that it would happen are you learning are you learning it was prophesied it would happen the first coming of Jesus and the second coming can someone open for us Isaiah 61 I want you to see the the prophecy of the first coming and the second coming of Jesus all right Are We There Brother do you have it on the screen it says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the me he sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted Proclaim Liberty to the captives opening of the prison to them that abound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vance of our god this is Isaiah prophesying and he is speaking about the first and the second coming of Jesus brother give me that verse again I want you to notice that in your Bible you canline it he talks about proclaiming the acceptable year of the Lord and then he says and the day of Vengeance of our God now follow me Clos the acceptable year of the Lord was the year of was great day of the Lord a wonderful time where everybody's going to be free the Bible says he that the son of man has set free is free when did Jesus set us free when he died on the cross when he died on the cross that time unless you want to be bound you are free are you following me when did that happen in his first coming that was the acceptable year of first coming of Jesus but then again keep the verse there brother but then again here after the acceptable year he says he's also going to declare the the day of V listen brother elst day of vengeance is the Dreadful day that we just read in the Book of Malachi 4 verse1 says behold the day cometh which shall burn as an talking about the judgments of God that is not happening the first time Jesus comes that is happening the second coming of Jesus of the Messiah when he comes but in the first coming he's coming as a savior he's coming to die on the cross to bring Grace to bring freedom to bring Salvation but the second coming is not coming to do that he's coming to condem listen the only thing good thing that is happening in this second is is going to Rapture the are you following me but he Second Coming he's not coming with Mercy for anybody actually the Bible continually says you know when he talking about the third world war now you know as they were fighting against Israel and you know he calls it aedon and when he came down when he was coming down you know he came and consumed all of them every living on the earth was destroyed what that's the god of is coming with r coming with judgment coming with destruction because he's coming oh hallelujah hallelujah he's coming to set down here on Earth a new world order a world order where he will be the king of all the Earth to fulfill the scripture which says the kingdoms of the world have now become the kingdom of our God is Christ and he he shall reain so when is he going to rain over the Earth it is going to be in the Millennium when he comes down on Earth but wait a moment what about you that fear his name what about you that believe his word in he saying the son of his righteousness shall come and arise to you with willings in wings that's what I want what is it talking about there wings wings everybody say Wings come on say it again Wings when is that going to happen I will fly away Oh Glory I will fly away so those wings are going to happen in the Rapture going to arise give us that verse brother CH 4 thank you Brothers for your patience he says unto you that fear my name unto you that fear my name he is talking to us now he's talking to me amen unto you that fear his name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wing Pentecostal thing is just healing in the body but it is much more than that healing in the body just the honest but the great deal the Rapture the catching away of the Bride we are going to be taken out of this world and we shall ever be with the Lord so that is his second coming to you that fear his name have a Rapture but to the others the judgments of God are waiting for them in his second coming now we have now seen go back to Isaiah we have now seen in Isaiah he has prophesied and spoken about the first coming and the second coming where is it Isaiah 61 here he says to it is in one verse to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of v and to comfort all that to comfort those that part is there for for us but it says the day of Vengeance the second coming is Vengeance first coming is the of the Lord now listen Church listen when Jesus came here now this one when he came isn't he the one he speaking over here the prophecy but when he came he read this verse from verse one he reached verse two he didn't vers he read it up to the part which says the AC and he left the other part he closed the book and he said to the people this day this scripture is fulfilled why because that first part of declaring the acceptable was fulfilled in his first coming the other part was not yet amen I want you give us that one Luke Chapter Brothers you're going to wait until I ustr the part of Elijah if you don't mind praise God are you there Luke I want you to see when Jesus I think chapter 4 when Jesus Takes this book in chapter 4 ver 17 and there was delivered unto him a book of the Prophet Isiah and when he had opened the book he found the place he knew what he was trying to I understand this prophecy he found the book the place which was written the spirit of the Lord is upon mey this time he was not prophesying this time he was reading it personally he was declaring to them that the spirit of the Lord is upon me it was now him he was speaking of himself Isaiah prophesy Jesus was reading that deing it himself that the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he sent me to heal the broken heart Deliverance to the cap and recovering of the sight to the blind to set Li them that are bre verse 19 now brother Fred verse of Isaiah 61 now follow me closely here if you if you can't explain this after I've explained it to you you've not understood you have to be able to explain it to somebody so follow me now to preach the acceptable year of the when Jesus read this place he put a full stop he put a full stop there's a full stop right there but where he was reading in Isaiah 61 verse 2 there was a but Jesus put a full St because this was now his first coming the other details were not necessary at this time he was talking about his second com Hallelujah when you come here yes yes you did so well see in Isaiah oh brother Isaac if you can flush it on the screen there both those scriptures Isaiah and and and and and and Luke you see in Isaiah he says to proclaim the acceptable are you seeing it in your Bible the AC the Lord the day of venance of our God the Messiah is the same but his coming is different are you following me these are just illustrating the Messiah who came the first time is the one who came the second time you understand but these on are just representing the first and the second so now yes yes you the first Messiah you can stand there so now when he came the first time he was coming to to proclaim the acceptable year the and he would come again the second time to do what to proclaim the day of vengeance Our God by this time these words the day of Vengeance was not necessary for Jesus to speak so when you go to Luke he skipped it in of a and the Bible says and he close the book everybody say close the book he closed the book and he gave it unto the minister and he sat down and all the eyes of them were in the synagogue were F they looked at him are you trying to in and he began to say unto them this day this day there is another day coming but this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears what was that portion meaning only what I have read in your ears not eyes but ears meaning the words I was reading is fulfill today this day my first coming but there is another day another day coming and that other words of the day of V shall be fulfilled but for now in this day this scripture is fulfill in your ears they wanted to Stone him how can you the Messiah oh my goodness I don't know whether you get it do you know why they wanted to kill him because they missed El they were supposed to receive an's Min which would prepare them to receive but when mesiah came they recognized him not they missed the ministry which PR them understand when this ministry came they actually did not recognize it also if you miss Elijah of your day you will miss the Messiah Elijah's Ministry is very important because It prepares you for the Messiah praise praise God okay give me now Malachi now it says behold I will send you elij oh this one is very sweet do you have it there yes I will behold I would send you everybody say Elijah the prophet oh you're saying it very very Wily us all say behold I send you Elijah the prophet I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day so there oh hallelujah hallelujah that is two days of the Lord and before each day an Ministry it say Amen now when Elijah comes what is he going to do is's coming to turn the hearts of the father to the children and this Elijah who comes before the second coming of Jesus turn the hearts of the children to the fathers it is the same verse but it speaks to different things so when you read the Bible as if they newspaper you will miss it you will miss that and you don't understand but it is in the Bible there notice here verse five speaks about two days of speaks about two comings of speaks about two different works that this Elijah will [Music] do oh Brothers you must be going to get a bigger blessing for now because you're really helping the people to understand this look how can we know that this Elijah only did the first portion of turning the hearts of the father our Bible will tell us everything must be in the Bible open your Bible praise God Matthew in the Book of Matthew I believe it is are you all there praise God speaks about the birth of John okay I think I I was looking for Luke chapter one me pleas Luke chapter 1 brother Marin give it to me verse 13 but the angel said unto him fear not zachari for th prayer is hard and wife Elizabeth shall bear their son shall call him his name John now this is John going to be born okay everybody say Amen if you is going to be born now okay and then he says for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor drink no strong drink John I hope you don't drink those things a very good type and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's When God Says something has to come to his word never fails that's the reason why I've served Jesus all the 70 years because I trust him every day more and more he can never fail he said something that has never happened that this John would receive the Holy Ghost in his mother's have you ever seen it happen but when God spoke it by an Angel it was potentially fulfilled and when Mary met Elizabeth hallelujah oh sister Eliz God bless you when Mary met Elizabeth Elizabeth had a baby in her sto baby John and baby John was almost dead he had never responded but when Mary came to Elizabeth you know they were cousins so when they met Mary had Jesus in the stomach let me tell you there is nobody else who gives the Holy Ghost but Jesus Hallelujah he started giving the Holy Ghost when he was in the womb when Mary's bu met with Elizabeth when they huged Jesus touched John and joh began why he was filled with the power of the Holy Ghost right in the stomach of to fulfill the prophecy which say he shall receive the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb hallelujah hallelujah the word of God never fails and then many of the and then he continues on and because of John many of the children of Israel shall be turned to the Lord their God and John shall go before Jesus John shall come before Jesus in the power and in the spirit of in your Bible in the spirit and power of el Hallelujah this man here John was not coming as John he was not coming as a son of Zarah he was coming according to what the Bible say power and in the spirit of Elijah to do what do you all remember Malachi 4:6 let us remind ourselves Mal chter 4 verse 5 6 and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children everybody and and the Heart of the children to their fathers now let us go to Luke what will John do the scripture say when Jo's Ministry comes he shall go in the power and in the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children is the scripture it disappeared brother Marvin give us the scripture here all right and then what else will he do all right go down down there okay everybody let us read verse 17 and it shall go read with me now and in the power of elas to turn the fathers to the children and the disobedient the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord let me ask you a question where did turning the hearts of the children to the fathers go are you following me are you confused are you confused church are you following me did you understand that so what what is he talking about he's talking about John's Ministry being in the power and the spirit of to turn the hearts of the fathers but he did not mention children to fathers that was not for John that was for this El are you following now who are the fathers to the children these are the sades and phes fathers of the law their hearts are going to be turned by when he was preaching to them repent repent it was being turned from the Lord to from the Lord to Grace from Moses to Jesus John's Ministry was fulfilled by simply preaching repent and when his ministry was finished John was K they cut off his head and they put it on a because his ministry was finished so Pastor why did they cut his I ask you a question why didn't they cut off his head before he finished his work it doesn't matter how you die but when you die it means god is finished with you and you cannot die until God is finished are you hearing me that's why me I don't fear death when it comes it comes but as far as I know when I is not done with me I'm going nowhere whether someone sends you witchcraft whether someone hates you someone does some people like doing even if you against me I am going nowhere I am here when God is not done with me I'm going nowhere same for you brother sister you are going nowhere you should tell the devil I am here as long as Jesus is not done with me I have more work for him and John stayed for as long as Jesus wanted him to accomplish his work and when Jesus was done with him was Jesus done with him the day John introduced Jesus to the world he says Behold the Lamb of God Tak the of the his true but the people are still what is he talking about they understand they they missed John they were waiting for a man called Elijah elah came but for them what did they see they saw a man who is having rugs a man who is not educated a man who is who doesn't know how to speak very well who was eating wild H and lo they said you are crazy man you see all the the dreadlocks and everything you have a problem John John please excuse us they came to him and asked him who he was who who he was let me show you something here let me show you something talking about John Isaiah 43 prophesied the voice of him that cth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a Highway To Our God if you heard it say Amen that is the prophecy of John Malachi 31 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his [Music] Temple is that amen they didn't understand but those prophetes both were speaking about joh where is my John can you come back here people stood before John I have a scripture here the says and this is the record of John John 1 ver when the Jews sent priests from Jerusalem to ask him who are you the people didn't understand who so they came to ask who are you and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ remember we are learning now listen carefully he confessed that he was Christ sorry that he was not the Christ but he denied not that he was Christ Christ means the anointed one so he denied to be the Christ but he accepted that he was anointed with a spirit of listen Church the spirit of Elijah was not a man Elijah incarnating in another man it is the spirit of Jesus Christ or rather call it the spirit of God that worked upon Elijah that God used on other men so you see John was anointed with the spirit of Christ but he was not the Christ this one was the Christ but this one was John elah so when they asked him he said no I'm not I'm anointed but I'm not the Christ and they asked him what then are you Elijah and he said I am not hallelujah hallelujah now to people who did not believe that John Was Elijah John himself spoke in his own mouth and he said I'm not elij so how do you do with that now before I continue before I continue let me read for you Matthew 11:13 in the words of Jesus all the prophets and the law prophesied until John and if ye will receive it this is El which was for to come he has don't worry let me give you some ration now here Elijah who was John they asked are you Elijah he said no why did he said no because because these people when they saw John and they were calling him Elijah they thought he was this Elijah so he said I'm not that one even when they saw the Messiah they thought he was this Messiah he said no I'm not that you you understand people always want to push things ahead or behind they don't want to believe what is happening they were accepting Jesus as long as he is the Messiah who is coming to rule the world to sit on the throne of David but he said no I'm not my kingdom is not of the this world that's why the Jews never accepted the Messiah they were confused the Messiah is supposed to sit in the why is he not accepting I believe I believe even Judas is he must have believe that idea that's why he betrayed him because he knew he must sit on the throne and he was waiting for Jesus to reain to rule over the world so he didn't expect him to die you have to understand when Jesus J died people lost hope but the problem was one they misallocated Bible prophecy so if you miss it today missing the Messiah are you Elijah he said no I am not that Elijah but Jesus said are you that prophet he said no do you know what that scripture means says are you that Prophet how many Bible readers do we have very few okay how many Christians do we have I'm trying to challenge you I know you have to read the Bible Christians read the Bible in theonomy there was a prophecy that the Lord God shall raise up a prophet like unto me Moses spoke that a prophet like unto me that was not John that was speaking of the Messiah are you following me so here when they were asking are you that prophet were promised that he will come like unto Moses he said no I'm not John knew his place in the script are you following me are you following me so now they asked him a question so tell us who are you that we may give an answer to them that sent us what say thou of th and he he said I am the voice of one crying in the wild make straight the way of the the prophet saidh that's what John answered I am the voice of one crying in the wildness straight the way of the lord The Way of the Lord you know that prophecy was speaking about the coming Prophet Mah and Jesus when he came these people did not because they miss John they miss the Messiah so they killed him and when they killed him and he left the sin I'm sure I not to call you back so when he left the scene after he had announced the people who he was the people still didn't understand him you know you remember we asked him whether he's Elijah he said he's not and again we ask him whether is that prophet and he said is not and when we asked him who he is he said I am the voice from the Wilderness do you know that that prophecy is actually speaking about of el yes so why did he let us leave this John guy but by doing that they did not solve the puzzle of the prophecy they missed the Messiah so they asked him who are you and he said before Abraham was I am Abraham just to see my he saw it and he was who are you I'm the resurrection and the life this is confusing who are you if you don't believe I am here you will die in your how can he speak like that because they missed and when the Messiah came he told them if you will receive it John Was Elijah which was to come but still they didn't understand knowled one day they come to him again they come to the Messiah again brother give us that scripture I'm approaching the finishing of this listen they come with a scripture again in the Book of Matthew vers 17 vers 10 my my are you there marthew 1 ver 10 praise God and his disciples asked him saying now his disciples again they asking the Messiah why did describe say that Elijah must first come let me ask my students this morning where did the scribes say that in which prophecy does anyone who has been following know Malachi chapter five good students now the scribes said before the great and now this is Jesus now the great day of the Lord they missed John now they asking Jesus we are confused we can't place scriptures why did the scribes say must why why did they ask that question follow me closely please follow me why did they ask Jesus that question if you read from verse one this is the Mount of transfiguration you remember that when Moses and Elijah appeared and Jesus was changed and he was in aoud together with MES and they received the Revelation did did Moses die did Moses die yes did Elijah die so Elijah was a type of the those who did not die who are still alive Moses was a type of those who are dead in Christ Jesus was the Messiah you remember the scripture in first thalon which we read here you remember it the dead in Christ shall rise F Moses then we which and Al remain shall be changed El and then we shall meet the Lord in the air they saw Jesus and then they say so you are the Messiah you are the Messiah so you have been the Messiah now solve this for us if you are the Messiah if you are the Lord so tell us why have you come before why did the scribes say must first come we have not seen El and if you the mesiah how come El did not come they even said the scribes they they doubted whether that was a prophecy they thought someone just WR but Jesus answered them oh I love Bible prophecy and I love Jesus he is God he's not just a man he's more than a man he gave his word and he knows how to interpret it Hallelujah so Jesus answered them Jesus answered them here praise God are you following me okay let me find my scripture here so Jesus answered and said unto them El truly mesiah please come come closer look the other side when they ask him why did they say that elas must first come we have not seen El so Jesus answered them yeah yeah yeah true Elias elah truly is pointing not but first come now have you got the understanding have you got the Revelation now the wisdom of the spirit have you got the understanding it enter bro he talked about the Elijah who is shall first come and he introduces another word and restore all things let me ask you a question did John restore anything if you have been following me what did he do he pre he he he prepared for something new the Messiah was coming he prepared for the Messiah and when the Messiah came when his ministry was finished but now here oh hallelujah hallelujah the mesiah is say El shall trly and restore all things that is another Ministry that is another man coming in the end time not John the Baptist Jesus was simply telling them yes before I come the second time Elijah will first come and restore all things hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus also knew elah had already and people had missed him so he continued but in in Ethiopia we say again again but I sayto you El is come already Hallelujah but I say unto you that Elias is come already already so he says is come already and they knew him and you did unto him whatever you like shall also the son of man even me I'm going to suffer like that because you don't understand me when he say that he said he's talking about after John has already but that one was already fulfilled already already and Jesus was telling them he already came but that when they missed it just like when he told them he will come they also missed now we are here Mah already came and we are here the question is are we going to miss proph the way they did this is a Bible prophecy it must happen Elijah must come and rest all when this elah comes he will rest all and Mah will come where are we we are right here we are right here don't miss it Elijah must come with anti Ministry to restore all things there will be many prophets many preachers many churches in but when Elijah come he's coming with a special Ministry his ministry is going to be different he will talk against women preachers because the Bible says so he will he will talk against infant baptism because the Bible says he will preach one go and he will preach against the Trinity because the Bible says he will teach every teacher the apostles told because his work is to restore all all teachings of the Apostles all Bible teachings all foundational teachings of chran he will restore Elijah must come this time if he doesn't come Jezebel will finish his life spiritual isra if he doesn't come jeel will finish you the Bible speaks and prophesies of a spiritual jeel read your Bible he says a woman I wish I had time I go there a woman seated upon with names of blasphemy what is she she a church system covering the whole earth and the B says she makes the kings of the Earth to commit spiritual fornication and all the multitudes and all the people because that is the water she was Seated on it's symbolic in the Book of Revelation so the Bible speaks about Jezebel in the end time Jezebel is here again is here again telling children to be baptized baptizing babies who are simply crying Bing them in the name of the father and of the son where is that in the Bible Doctrine Jezebel Doctrine she teaching people in the same time it's okay you can be get no problem Grace is there teaching of Jezebel letting men and women be moral leaving the standards of the World and St being so low teachings of B they think they standing for God jeel made all the peoples of the world to fornicate spiritually with her spiritual immorality and that's why this is the time that God promised to send Elijah again when Elijah comes he comes with a ministry of food restoration of the whole word of God the way it is in the scriptures there will be men and women who will hear the message of Elijah and there will be different from all the world and they'll be prepared for the Rapture I am one of them I'm one of them Elijah has come hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah last night I listened to somebody called Robert lson or and and he was speaking on William Bram Bram and he said William Bram was the greatest Prophet the reals of Prophecy since the days of Jesus and this man said William Bram you could not compare him with anybody but then he says but he died a tragic death and it says because he he Backle and went into teaching and yet his ministry was in the prophetic when I listen to that I was going to switch it off I said let me finish it and then when I finished it I just simply noticed these men are not given to know the Bible says huah there are some who are given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but some are not given to I believe I'm one of those who are given William Bram William Bram was a prophet everybody in the religious World believes they believe he was just a prophet to prophesy to heal and to raise the they actually believe in his ministry to that extent but when it comes to the teaching of the word they said it is not his place they even understand the Bible in the Bible the ministry of a prophet is the one that receives the revelation of the word all the other prophets spiritually worldly bar but when Elijah came what did he do he stoop down took the stones them together the does teaching the right placing back the landmarks and after that he now called upon God the miracle of fire comes to vindicate the word which is being brother Bram on the day of his accident do you know what happened there's a drunk driver who came and he's he was driving on the opposite side of the Lan which brother bam was driving and brother Billy Paul was in the other car which was ahead so they saw the drunk driver coming brother was in the car with his wife and so B Paul dodged the driver and then the driver just came brother B had not seen him so he hit and so they crashed and when they crashed they went through the windshield again so they were in that ruin the sister died immediately the wife of brother bam and and and and and brother bham was still alive many bones were broken over and uh then you know bil ran back and found him there and then she said he said is Mommy alive said no they touched his she was gone said place my hands on her so laid his hand on her said Lord help us in our time of trouble let Mommy not die and just a few words he mattered and in a moment she came back to and in all his ministry he rose up five people from the dead she was the and yet he died from the same accident John the Baptist died a tragic death but he was Elijah Elijah who received the spirit of Elijah the first time he died theyed him but his death also had questions did you know that in his death he rose they threw a dead body on him and because it touched him the person came back I'm talking about elah Elijah nobody knows where he is because he never died it's question the ministry of Elijah is entirely questionable confuses the confus but to those it is sent no question because it's not about the man it's about the ministry it's about the word which they brought for and I want to tell you in our generation Elijah has come by the way Billy Paul has lived ever since he just died I think this past week or 88 years but I want to say this they have been living people who have seen the Min Jesus would prophesy and say Tru shall first come and restore all things and I want to tell you that Jesus spoke has already come and has restored all things we now know B in the name of Jesus CHR we now know the teachings of the scriptures why because of the ministry of this theend time what are we waiting for we are waiting for the coming of hallelujah hallelujah praise God God bless you Brothers
