lost or something like that as he was going home that's also what i know so we don't have the detail so but i know that they are safe everybody's fine but never need to remember we just need to remember their new friend but you kidding you are selling entirely amen i mean you know when you are going to claim your land minimum wage nceo that's when the battle starts i will tell you where to turn the killer when god promised israel for a land thunder but god gave them grace they could turn their way to sir and they were able to take jericho so i believe too that's the father will take jericho amen i mean praise the lord come here so by god disgrace we are now in our new place yeah hey man nina uh it's not been easy i'm going to get to where we are now it's been with a lot of sacrifices made by very many people those of you who just came and saw it for your first time there have been brothers who have come here and even spent nights here what do you have never seen i did not expect brother wang to have as much strength as he has this morning not you may be wondering what did they do exactly really uh you cannot understand whatever i know that god and all your sacrifice that you have made god says god understands see there was very low lighting here you see the brothers had to put more lighting moving all those people you can't even see them because they have they've gotten so perfect because they've been in your there's also been other brothers who came from other uh church you see all these curtains the carpeting cuppity the wallpaper everything some of you thought it was stones you know whatever you see here with your natural hair you know where you are seated look at around where you're going to the truth between the world today how does it look it's been sacrificed of somebody you see brother andrew holgan andrew who gave me the day he came here i think he was coming from some office or something he and also very smart i want to say we appreciate all these brothers could not even work not call me because you know about the shame who kind of ashamed but the shame was always around to make sure people have eaten sometimes also to do some work here uh you know and i don't know who i have forgotten that was really here and i think some others i might have skipped but god cannot skip yours praise the name of the lord so god has been so good to us um i do not have all the details i would have wanted we felt we felt that we had to do it this way why would it take a song so we've spent money a lot of money which we all including you are yet to pay yes this like i is i don't have all the details and i would not want to give you the half details but i'd like you to remember that and maybe on sunday i'll be able to give you all the details but maybe what i can say is i want to appreciate those who have cleared off their pledges that they made what's the rental for this place which was pledged and one million is due for payment and i believe that god will help you to fulfill those pledges so that we can continue to reach our attack i believe in worshipping god in spirit and in truth [Music] i also believe heaven is not that secret and if i'm going to heaven and i have a little heaven down here it should be portraying where i am going when the one you know so if someone can't if i bring someone to church when they say they're promising them of heaven they would not understand that the place i'm taking them too or that i'm promising them that the bible the word of god is promising them is really real brother was one day god is going to prosecute but i believe that children of god must not live in a sort of state because we worship a god who is more than enough you see what he has given you is not enough he's going to give you more yeah and what he has done for us is not enough he's going to bring more towards it i want to say this is just the beginning they're gonna come back to academy capitan dc are

will forget the word let's uh go to the book of regulations i had my part two of the jericho that i want to talk about today but uh yesterday picked up another inspiration i'm gonna get it and this young man i forget his name i think his name was joe yeah let me tell you when he asked a question and the question took us to revelation 10. and so i asked her brother isaac to take him through revelation 10. [Music] so you are missing the whole story now i asked brother isaac to take through the other young man through revelation 10. uganda and so as i had them talk i i got an inspiration to speak on this this morning everybody there is but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets may the lord bless us this morning may be seated before i forget on thursday the lord willing i'll be traveling through karamoja when i understood that he was in a critical condition i asked i was trying to find out if another brother could be able to take up his responsibility and complete those two last chapters underwent the operation but while he was on the hospital bed he told me please do not give those chapters to anyone remember i want to translate them myself the month of uh july we said he did finish those two last chapters and he also proved several messages which others had done a work that he has never done before the quantity of work he did i was actually even impressed i was about to call him and ask him how did you do all this singing so he asked one of the people uh brothers to take him to the hospital um and and while there that very morning he passed away again so i want to say he really went very well barrio was uh on yesterday actually yes he dwight joe i'm not sure whether he was buried i've not had the latest but i know that the barrio funeral service was could be yesterday uh chairman [Music] what will be your legacy after you leave but now we have something to remember our brother with brother marvel give me that church that you will be remembered but i pray that things will be said today which will help you and help all of us to get deeper into the knowledge of the world [Music] service in this place what you know and so don't create a bad impression for the devil stand you know first impression it usually matters if the devil thinks ah this is a sucker like this that is where i will always go so don't be cold you know sometimes i realize when the preacher is not preaching and but teaching getting into people what of the voice fellowship and i think the verse we have read today is the reason why and today what i'm speaking on now we have read the verse it says but in the days of the voice yeah please put it up for us but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel named catch right away which was a mystery rooney charichama and it will continue to be a mystery era until the days of the voice we need to receive the voice at the moment situation i need to know the voice say it's a good demonic we need to hear the voice because without that it doesn't matter we blind not know god to man obama but are praise the name of the lord come here the worst situation that has ever been on earth a man just since there will be a river is for someone to be blind and they don't know someone who is blind but they think they can see someone who is deaf but i think they can hear caddy and they would read out of the book of isaiah and others unto us anything a son is born a child is given oman actually the government will be upon his shoulders that they turned to jesus and they said you are wait a minute you hear that you the scripture they read hey when they came speaking about him but they called him after reading when he appeared before them we all become a sugar they did not see him they did not recognize him together because they were not sensitive to the spiritual things [Music] how can you say our father is the devil [Music] okay do you know we are the children of abraham permanently by the bible and the promise was given to the seed of abraham next tuesday when saturday and but they also were blind never mind that here the promise was not to the natural seed of abraham the real promise checkdown was to the royal seed of abraham satan yeah he blamed the darkness of abraham jesus was the promised seed yes in the book of genesis he was the one the seed of the woman and when he appeared on us he was the one supposed to possess the gate of his enemies and that is why jesus breathed the head of the serpent yes we are returning to mutual minnesota but no other could anymore how could jesus even do that yes yes because it was the sea that was promised to come but when he came among his own they because jesus is the same yesterday i'm sorry i did not give you the one i have but if you can quickly get me the the the picture because i want you to prepare to show it of the church edges the mystery of god hey let us first talk about this mystery everyone go to the book of daniel chapter 12 verse one to four females okay are you there brother amen listen and at that time shall michael stand up the grand prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble [Music] such as never was since there was a nation even to this to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book [Music] of hey friends i want you to pay attention very much to these scriptures what we are sharing on today what i'm sharing with you today is not my opinion [Music] was the youngest not just some ideas of some preacher coming from some place or maybe the ones that you are i'm giving you the mind of god [Music] his entire plan for redemption [Music] people we have many denominations and they all read this bible you see the way you read no one is god does not think [Music] do you think we are born just to live and eat and then die where are you going i don't know from i know i was in the mind of god foundation of the world i know that's where i am going to go hallelujah amen i am not just windy experiment i am a son of god the man our catholic you are the daughter of god only one hour you must go back where you came from you know and why did you come here right what you come here to manifest the nature and character of your origins hallelujah amen we are not just jokers on the earth they don't even know if he couldn't see our father has a plan for the name and we have received the knowledge of the plan can we now cut it into it to change them praise the name of the lord come here and you will see it here now in the book of daniel daniel this is prophetic this is prophetic and we'll get of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to a shame and everlasting content on shall shine as the brightness of the family [Applause] righteousness they will shine as they start forever and ever now are i choose time committee for now daniel never forget shut up the world external every time of every camarilla seal of the book take a team to that time i want to tell you before i even get [Applause] hallelujah amen this is the time that you said the mystery of god finished your nacho all right now i would like us to look at this prophecy of daniel from verse one little and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which stands for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time that people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book [Music] and major prophets in the world and daniel at the time when they were not in their country when they had gone to exile the body of one man would say during i think the reign of uh um of uh i don't remember the king probably the king of katniss or wherever he was but before that let me check this danielle was reading other prophets before him and daniel read from prophet jeremiah that nobody else had and daniel when he counted we are about [Applause] for the sins of his people [Applause] [Music] you don't know how to [Applause] i think you can be watching is [Applause] details so why you're gonna mind every single you can listen to the message seventy weeks of daniel by brother branham myself did some skits and some videos what to what would happen in the future aquarium now you need to understand that israel god deals with israel as a country is [Music] physical we are the church they are the church natural we are the church spiritual yes all the promises they receive physically for us we receive spiritual vision [Music] [Music] right now seven years one week weekend is uh uh equal to seven years yes seven years here comes sam so we noticed that excuse me now we noticed that that time of the jewels was to end at the ending of the 70th week the weekend somewhere but the messiah jesus christ by the time he came and he started this ministry [Music] [Music] then the times of the jews would be put to a point where you died and a time of the gentiles would come in they turned the kid when the time of the gentiles has been fulfilled god would go back to israel here is what i want us to see today when jesus came on earth and he preached his ministry for three years and a half and she that was the first part of the last week of the jewish time and commented so if you do not like math in school oh today is not going to be a good service [Music] because god is a good man you're in good company years now jesus yes his ministry was for how long but three years and a half so that is the first part a challenge okay of the last week of the year right mean and when jesus was cut off cut yes god remembered these poor gentiles by the way of the cross the blessing of the all that became the blessing of the younger okay amen that's why we say we are children of abraham by promise [Music] seven is completion [Music] [Music] last week the last [Music] jews no rachel that's that time will start counting again after the rapture of the gentiles
