you amen amen so before we uh this morning I just want to to let you know Pastor Robert kabas is already here and we just so happy we'll just invite introduce him to you in just a moment but before we do that quickly I just want to get something out of the way you know uh this is a young fellowship and you know like I always tell you we are not a church we are just part of the church or maybe let me put it this way we are a church but we are not the church okay yes you know you know we are just a members of a church of the church this is a fellowship and we have the Church of Jesus is all over the world even here in CA there are many members of that church so we just a little Fellowship part of the Church of Jesus Christ church is the one built upon the rock of Revelation and he say the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against and so we believe we are part of that triumphant church but this little Fellowship has uh been in existence for I I did not go back to check but I believe for uh perhaps two years and a few months someone who knows the dees you can throw it started a little bit in my home here and just me and my family from there we we went to uh uh actually Co hit us when we were in the home brother's home joined us and uh you know a few others joined in and we we used to have a lot of Youth Bible studies there throughout the whole time of and then after the enter a little shop I will always call it a shop you know about 30 40 people could sit in there God filled up then we got a tent and now finally we are here by God's grace amen if all our students are here I our chairs are no longer enough for us we need to buy more chairs but um by God's grace he has led us up to this time and is increasing the congregation by Souls getting saved by children being born was it last Sunday when I was dedicating one more child but also with by our young people getting married amen hallelujah and so uh but brother bam speaks on on marriage in the message wedding ceremony 1965 he says it is therefore not by any to be entered into an advisably or lightly but advisably soberly and in the fear of God and so uh can I invite you brother Andre to just come at this time Andre and I'm I'm making you an example of this quot because you you are you are one of the young our young people who are warming up to get married amen well you can just stand right there if you want to come on your a minister you can come up amen so brother Andrew if you are going to marry don't just walk into marriage you have to walk into it advisably uh soberly and in the fear of God and so Andrew came to me I'll make the long story short and he told me that uh he wanted to get married and so I advised him and I'm doing this for a purpose because there many of you who are warming up for the same so excuse me if I take a little time here and so I told him I advised him on how marriage is supposed to be conducted according to the message and uh his his desire was for God to lead him to the right to the right one amen and uh brother andrewy is here today because he's saying God led him to the right one amen and so uh brother Andrew uh came to me and told me the sister's name and uh I did not know her so much but we invited her they came we had several meetings together with them give them some counsel and decisions were made and today we here for the next step the message the marriage of the Lamb he says and then after the decision is made that you are then comes the engagement amen so I'd like to invite the sister to come some of you are going to see for the first

amen so you need to prepare that will be shortly after our youth meetings and prepare to support them you heard the scripture don't only support them with prayers but also with money so sister Fe we receive you we shall receive you and we shall continue to receive you amen so God bless you and with all that joy we are now entering into the service theice beginning now we are entering into the service when I moved here with my uh my uh family you know we just shortly uh back fromis Ababa and we just back Uganda living inana but then the Lord led us to move here so I of course spoke to a few friends that we had in Cala pastors and uh they all encouraged us to do whatever the Lord had laid on our heart you know if you are young and in anything you need to seek counsel from those that have gone before you even if you thought that the Lord had led you and so uh Pastor Robert is one of those that uh encouraged us to continue you know he told me have you started the church yet I said no we in the house we are we are he said no you start once you start the Lord will give you Grace and we are behind you there many who said that but Pastor Robert has really meant it all these years amen and he has been standing with us recently we had our youth meetings here how many enjoyed the song reading of brother en this is the pastor brother and so uh most of these young people were here and even when they have their own youth meeting [Music] but after their they still came to support ours and I know even this year they are going to have theirs which we are intending to support and I'm sure they intending to support our it's a blessing to have men of God that do not have Mo other motives in preaching the gospel but they just have one motive the souls you know those are usually God called men and I've sat down with brother Robert several times and I can you know tell you without missing my words I believe he A God Called man I believe that with all my heart his only business is to send out the message printing a lot of messages before we even started doing the printing here when we went to we found he had already been there his name was being mentioned and so um we appreciate Pastor Robert for his love and Zeal towards this message and I call him my older brother amen and so he's here with his wife and some of his children uh so God bless his wife is over there God bless you so much we really really appreciate you all so can you stand up as we invite uh the minister Robert of lifebo Min I believe the Lord will use him as a teacher you know his ministry and mine are bit different you know uh I'm a bit Evangelical but is a teacher and I already warned you and I told you to bring your books and pens I don't be ready to learn the message of the hour be expectant whatever you expect God will grant it to you amen so Pastor Robert have your full Liberty we have the message and whoever gives us the message we appreciate that so much amen so don't be in

this place just take a moment now while you close your eyes to meditate a little bit about what we have [Music] heard the Gate of Heaven did you know we are the people that have arrived at that [Music] place where Jacob was but the problem of it is people are still running away why your life is still the same and there is no change because you're still running away but if you can come to yourself and you realize what God is doing in our generation like Jacob you will realize I'm in the house of God where his [Music] bread his bread for the end [Music] time has been SED Jesus has a table spread where his Saints have fed and he's inviting you come and die oh this is the message of the hour we have an invitation to come to the house of God is PR we will not need to pray and fast for the for the gate to be open because it has already been [Music] open healing is yours what do you have need of whatever you have need of is yours is yours the man of God has been an angel of God ministering to you if only you can receive a personal [Music] revelation what this is it was not a coincidence that Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem where the man of God Jacob had seen the Revelation already of the [Music] place and the man of God has read to us a court [Music] and he said he built his Tabernacle of [Music] Flesh and [Music] Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that you know what God is when you see Christ where is Christ the Bible says that there shall be many false anointed many false Christ in the end time but God has sent us the true anointed one the messenger the angel the star of this [Music] generation to come and restore us back to the world and when you see that then you know what God is you have access the windows of Heaven are going to be open for [Music] you because you've come to the door we have come by by accepting this message you've come to the door you're walking through do you think you can walk through that door and you remain sick and you remain needy I want to challenge you now before we close the [Music] service to just commit all your needs before him something good is about to happen something good is in store for you what is your desire what is your need you see when the word of God the true word of God has been ministered the Holy Spirit follows that to accomplish it so in in in a minute why don't you present your needs before you and then we shall pray to give him thanks for providing so everyone just go in prayer now and just commit if you don't have needs pray for the needs of [Music] another for his Emmanuel is here with us he knows the desires of our [Music] heart oh Jesus we come to you Lord at the closing of this [Music] meeting Lord I know that the man of God still had a lot to say much more in your Storehouse for us but I pray that the words that have been spoken that you have allowed him to say today oh Father Lord may you water it Lord Jesus in the hearts of your people [Music] father may we quit [Music] running may we come to ourself Lord and realize we are in your house this is where the Gate of Heaven is the Gate of Heaven is not in some some kind of denomination out it's not in some kind of organization out there or some religious movement it is right here in the message of the hour this is where all things are possible may you open our eyes of understanding that we may know as we are [Music] known your word has been opened SE have been revealed and now we know who we are we know we are not supposed to be sick we know we are not supposed to be poor we know we are not supposed to you know be in these bad conditions because we know who we are we are not no longer Jacob but now we know we are Israel we a prince with God and we are walking in [Music] power give each of us that Revelation that understanding that even as we leave this [Music] place that
