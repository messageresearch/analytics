person have been passing through something but I thank the Lord that the Lord has seen me through blessed be the name of the Lord amen shall we turn to our Bible our brother G you're most welcome we glad to have in our midest amen uh read with me second Corinthians uh chapter 4 vers 8 we should begin from Seven it says but we uh but we have these Treasures in Earthly vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might uh Jesus might be made manifest in our more am M of Flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have uh we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sake that the bound that the abundant grace might through the thanks uh the Thanksgiving of many redown to the glory of God for [Music] fore for amen precious Lord we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read and Lord I pray that you just come and give me the inspiration this evening speak the hungry hearts for we know that any man any anybody can turn the pages of this Bible father only you who gives the inspiration have your own way this even in Jesus name amen may have your seats praise the Lord hallelujah hallu amen I trust that I not take long today yeah just if you pray for me blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen I want us to go back to where we have just read I want to turn around and welcome your neighbor your brother and tell tell him or her this words it's not over yet I have not heard you until the devil as well is not yet over amen praise the Lord that's what I'm going to talk about it is not over yet amen hallelujah and I've come to tell the enemy that same words and we have to recho the same word to the enemy blessed be the name of the Lord no matter what we are going through amen but one thing we are sure of as long as Jesus is still on the throne he's still working it out for our good blessed be the name of the Lord many time we go through things many time we have challenges blessed be the name of the Lord until we are discouraged but my brother my sister I want to tell you something trouble everywhere you go this side there is trouble you go the other side there is trouble you go to your workpl there there's trouble amen sometime you find trouble praise be to God Amen but he said yet we are not distressed we are public but not in despair amen many times we have questions without answer we ask ourselves why things are moving like that praise be to God but it says but we are not in despair sometime many times people get depressed because they have questions without answers they try to figure out things however much they try they only hitting on the dead end blessed be the name of the Lord and others commit suicide because they are hopeless when they look at themselves when they look at their families they look at where they came from things they have they going through things they have gone through and it's like they're in darkness they are not seeing answer anywhere they're not seeing anything like a of Hope and there the Devil Comes in and tells him that you are useless and the moment he listen to that voice inde indeed I'm useless but I'm here to tell you brother sister amen we are not useless blessed be the name of the Lord but we have treasure in this F God knew us before the foundation of the world he knew that live in this generation blessed be the name of the Lord amen he says that persecuted but not forsaken talk of persecution every time you are like a white bir minan black bues you are being persecuted at home don't say brother I'm not persed at home but talk persecution at your workplace you are persecuted at home you are persecuted whenever you are you are persecuted for Christ's sake amen you do good is misinterpreted blessed be the name of the Lord and I believe we are living in the time where this thing is happening but the Bible tells us the Bible gives us consolation that even though we are persecuted but we are not forsaken blessed be the name of the Lord that is where our confidence is the difference down but not destroy of man like Paul is talking about being cast down many time we are cast down many time we are challenged blessed be the name of the Lord but one thing we assur of that we are not destroyed because we have the seed of God in us that's why the Bible tells us man fall seven times and he rise again because though we are cast down we cannot be destroyed we cannot be finished because we have the Gen of God in us we have God's DNA in us and God cannot be destroyed the Alpha and Omega he the beginning and the ending end from the beginning is the one leading us is the one leading the battle blessed be the name of the Lord amen always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus must be manifest in our body blessed be the name of the Lord for the Bible tells us that kind minded is anity to God but it tell that when we walk in the spirit we shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh blessed be the name of the Lord and here Apostle Paul is telling us that for we which are always delivered unto death for Jesus that life also of Jesus might be manifested in our moral body not spiritual body now but the Life of Christ must be manifested in our m b that's why you have a mandate to walk in the spirit blessed be the name of the Lord and this evening I'm here to tell the devil and to encourage you that it's not over yet no matter what you are going through amen it's not over yet brother blessed be the name of the Lord God is still working on us and we are still winning the we are it's not yet over something is happening amen you may not be knowing it but I'm here to tell you this evening blessed be the name of the Lord that something is going on in the supernal for all the time you've been coming here each time you come and you attend the service blessed be the name of the Lord something is working out for you good maybe the devil there is another voice telling you that's not yet over amen blessed be the name of the Lord God has given us the prophecy that God has given us what we we need for our body [Music] change given us all we need to change our bodies and this what you are listening to this evening that is what you need amen you don't need another sermon you don't need another gospel we already has a restored word and that is what we are feeding on and we know that our body change is going on blessed be the name of the Lord he said that we are troubled on every side blessed be the name of the Lord but I'm here to tell you that we got we have hope we have the truth we are troubled but we have the truth though we are perplexed we have the victory amen now we are fighting battles but the victory is on our side why because we have got a God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is on our side blessed be the name of the Lord that's why though we are cast down we cannot be destroyed blessed be the name of the lordu amen praise the Lord that devil always want to swallow us up and that's why David says that if God was not on our side if just God was not on your side you not be here when you look back and you see things that God brought you some accident you were going the downward way one time there's a point to reach and you had no [Music] hope you did not even know that there is a redeemer we are walking according to the course of this world [Music] where the world say some people say there's no God and they tell that your parent are your God and maybe somehow you are caught in with that mind and he came and met situation we were in prise the Lord no matter what God gave us that which it is what shows not over God is still working praise the Lord why we are we are not forsaken amen amen amen am that same Grace is holding [Music] us and we shall look some examples in the Bible the man of God in the Bible the war but God himself who raised Christ from the dead shall present us over that these are the people am these are my redeemed this is my Overcomers for all things are for your sake that the abund grace might through Thanksgiving of many red to the glory of God and for which cause we faint not faint not blessed be the name of the Lord but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day amen might perish maybe squeeze with sickness maybe squeez with [Applause] perplex maybe troubled maybe you are sick and you are cast down your outward man is perishing but he says our inward man is you day by day why because of the word of God the J shall live by faith L it be the name of the Lord that's why even when we are sick we still glorify the Lord when we are broke we glorify him when we are persecuted we say God you are faithful when we are troubled we say God you are bigger than my mountain when we are in trial we said the Lord will give him strength when we are in darkness we still say the Lord is my life even when doctors declare and tell us that we are there no more hope blessed be the name of the Lord but our inward man say even when I walk in the shadow of the valley of I will fear no evil blessed be the name of the Lord that's why the Bible says that our inward man praise the Lord amen he is renewed every day blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] amen Romans 8: 38 say that for I am persuaded that neither death nor life not angels nor principalities not of powers not of things present not of things to come neither height nor death nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus to break that seal nothing can separate us neither height not of death talk of death is what's separating from love of God girlfriends boyfriends prostitutes money no nothing amen not any other creature shall be able to break that seal brother separating us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus bless blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord amen it's not yet over one time in Babylon the king declared a decree and told them if they don't worship that Idol they would throw them in the burning furnace blessed be the name of the Lord shall you turn to me and read the scripture we go to the Book of Daniel Daniel chapter 5 Dan oh no missing it see praise the Lord okay yeah this Daniel chapter 6 vers 16 say then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him into the the den of lion The King The King spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee blessed be the name of the Lord even the King was much aware that this man was serving God continually praise be to God he not say that the God who you serve sometime once in a while but the King was much concerned and much eager how Daniel was worshiping his God and here is telling Daniel that the God you are serving continually how do you serve your God blessed be the name of the Lord amen the same man who commanded Danel to be cast in the den of lion he knew that it was not yet over he knew that Daniel could not just end with lions blessed be the name of the Lord and wanted to know the next thing what next praise be to God so many time when the devil attacks us the devil knows he comes and do something on you when he's so sure that that's not it's not over that's why when the devil visited job and God asked him where are you from I was moving to and here and there Ken Uganda Tania have you considered myant is there is doing well the man is prospering he has even gained weight by the way is increasing every day say wow what a testimony what a man said but of course definitely you have to yeah because when you have favor with God with men but just just give me a give me access and I show you praise be to God when God gave the devil ACC the devil was so in fact the devil was not sure he went to attack job but knowing that God cannot give uh job to him wholeheartedly every move that God makes the devil knows is a trick praise be to things don't just come to that God can't get his own child and just give him praise the Lord amen as the devil has a hook he comes and Putter and throw in the Lake of the world is seeing something to eat looking at that word yet it is a tree it's a trap praise be to God is holding here it around does not just come and grab you and take you we have a good example in the Bible hook not our local hooks the local ones you can even see and pull out but it is the modified americs hold you just turn around and pull out do you think that devil is stupid to just come and put it when it is obvious no sir the devil is smart man the Devil is a theologian is a religious man amen he put he puts on those religious AR and comes with a Bible and said today we are reading John 3:16 for God so L the world that he gave his only begotten son whoever believes in him you see yeah the man has the word by the way when it is a bit when God gave the devil authority to attack job [Music] the devil knew very well it's not over yet Trap Is God putting here because the devil knows it child of cannot go get lost however much he however much as long as a SE of God that seed cannot get lost the only thing that devil can do is to SC you to put a scrash on you on you blessed be the name of the Lord because the seed of God cannot get lost praise the Lord amen and when he was given access then he carried on his dut as usual death stried him his children his animal his businesses blessed be the name of the Lord and then the devil came back amen oh praise the lord the devil came back to report to the master I have done the job but the man is bigheaded but I think is because you give me another access now praise be to God it was not yet over and job went through what he went through he suffered until the wife told him why don't you cast that God and die praise be to God but job inside his soul amen deep in his soul there was a seed of God and that voice was telling him job is not yet over blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm here to tell you the same praise be to God you are going to make it for the Rapture amen you are God's children praise be to God just keep on moving keep pressing on those habits will go because it's not yet over God is still handling it God is still working on it in one of these days you will stand like samel of old and look back and [Applause] say you look at the fornication you used to commit you look at the Witchcraft you used to do you look at the used to do you look at the hatred you used to and said this is God blessed be the name of the Lord amen and one day it was revealed to job and then job knew that I know my redeeming now that was the finishing time he had reached the finishing line now blessed the name of the Lord that's why a prophet tells us nothing can destroy us until God is done with us that's why Apostle Paul says nothing separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus as long as that love is there it is not yet over God is still working he still saving he's still healing he's still delivering he's still setting free amen our God is still working blessed be the name of the Lord and we are telling our enemies do whatever you want but one thing we know praise the Lord that is not yet over God is working on God is on our side and if he be for us who can be against us no enemy can be against us no hell can be against us because there God doing his work we are God's Masterpiece blessed be the name of the Lord and we know that we growing the St of the perfect man and we know the where we are going we are not walking in darkness it's like we are not like beating air but we know what we are speaking of we know what we are speaking about when we are talking of Christ we are not talking about Jesus a little Jesus in the M but we are speaking about the Holy Ghost living in us that is the Jesus we know see that when he the Holy Ghost is come he will lead you into all the truth and today when we speaking about Jesus the reason Christ is the one who came on the day of pente and we know that it's the one working on us that's why it tells us that look do not forsake assembling together as you seeing the days approaching because every time we assemble he's working on us he's revealing to us things we didn't know is making us understanding who we are blessed be the name of the Lord remember when they were cast in the in the burning furnace amen praise be to God the furnace was hit seven time and the Babylonian thought they uplift they make themselves spiritual now I'm a Catholic if if I I have bowed to this what have I lost I am also sh I've bowed down even I have my my you know those people think they are high praise be to God and that's how the devil always Mo Christian but this M for us we shall not we are not willing we are not ready and even if our God has not deliver us amen we shall not B down that is our law blessed be the name of the Lord we are not touching our constitution where we came from before the foundation of the world there is no bowing down for the image we are ready to face the burning fund after all our God is a consuming fire blessed be the name of the Lord because they came from Glory knew how the system of Glory works and that's why they knew that God is Planning something praise the Lord they knew that God is Not Just sitting they knew that God was not just washing a but God had a mega plan many time when we are squeezed the devil make us think that it's that's over but let me tell you brother sister every time when you are going through hardship God is Planning something amen glory is very busy amen angels are moving with your fire from one from one office to another office blessed be the name of the Lord why because somebody is going through a tri but remember the Bible tells us that God cannot allow us to be tempted beyond our faith hallu and when you see that your your trial is prolonged just know that in glory the other side angels are working on your problem they are handling your cases they are marking your papers the see where did he fail let him first redo this one there he passed correctly here is average but when he focused he can make it much better so God will first hold on a little blessed be the name of the Lord amen that's why I'm telling you this evening it is not yet over even when you've reached your death bed that is not the end of you because the Bible tells us that when the spirit that raise Christ from the dead when it dwelleth in us he will Quicken this moral body blessed be the name of the Lord even when we are down there that same spirit will Quicken oural bodies praise be to God even when you children have missed school for one time it doesn't mean that they will not go to school God is still working blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord amen even when you're planning a business and things does not add up brother sister that's not the end of it it's not over yet blessed be the name of the Lord may God help us and reveal help us to know our promises that God's word cannot fail Heaven and Earth will pass away but this word will never fail this word will stand the test of time because it came from God's mouth amen when God spoke the world in Genesis praise be to God the prophet said that God believed this word it might have taken 100 years or million years but the world came to pass because God knew that his word cannot fail blessed be the name of the Lord when those Young Mens were there and they were counting one two we are curing them on the third blessed be the name of the Lord but they knew may God help us to know how Glory Works how the other Kingdom works the other om cannot be bribed no sir the other Kingdom lecturers they will not sh exams for you we see the same paper with the presidents with the congressman with the Kings God presents us with the same examples praise be to God Andor praise be to God one thing we are sure of that when God gives us a paper he so sure that we are going to pass he says the exams presented before you and then the other side of the paper he's seeing only a praise be to God but when you look at it from of perspective you say this is unfair why me I'm not the worst sinner I'm not this or that I have tried my best but when you look at it from spiritual perspective you would say that all things work together for good blessed be the name of the Lord when they cast it where they cast in the burning furnace he was already there waiting blessed be the name of the Lord and surprisingly even the king the fire is the end of these guys he was expecting some spal something praise the Lord was not yet over and he was the first man to testify we cast three mens in the fire are you seeing what I'm seeing we c three men s but I'm seeing the fourth man the man got the Revelation and said the Fourth Man look like the son of man blessed with the name of the Lord amen God was working it out that same God is here tonight that same God is alive today amen and is telling the enemy do whatever you want it's not yet over but remember even the devil knows God cannot Just Surrender brother M to the devil without without a backup the other time I told you that God has his hard disk that disc blessed be the name of the Lord before the foundation of the world before he created the star before he became even God when he was still Elohim amen when he was still staying alone he got those people slay the lamp wrote their name in that hard dis in glory that is so safe is so secured that nobody can blot your name out of it and the devil knows those people because they are marked praise be to God even when he's attacking he knows even when you have access in your home he knows that any time I'm being I'm going to be kicked out of this house any I'm going to be kicked out of this place because this is a special person these are the pest of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and those are the people the Bible says in Daniel that those who will know their God they shall do explod why because before the foundation of the world they were somewhere so they bypass their theophany but inside their soul something tells them that they are not of this world that's why those people they dress like children of God they walk like children of God they talk like children of God they worship like children of God and they dance like children of God [Music] those one they come from another kingdom and that is the kingdom of darkness it is f the Kingdom full of lust full of filthiness full of dreadlocks full of mear full of smoking full of prostitution that's why that's why when they come they have to express the kingdom where they come from blessed be the name of the Lord but there's a group of people whom the Bible says hallelujah they were living in chip skins they were living in tents they're moving from place to place they were not settled they were looking for a kingdom SP they knew that there is a kingdom not this Earthly Kingdom not this a city they were not looking for New York they were not looking for campala they not looking for Nairobi they not looking foram they are not looking for California they are not looking for United Kingdom they were looking for a city build God himself the city where the Bible says where the lamb is the light blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen and those people even when they are worshiping God hallelujah they worship like Angels they worship even much better than Angels because the poet say we shall sing the we shall tell the story how we overcome we shall sing a song which the devil which even the angels will not be able to join blessed be the name of the Lord just IM much just think about it the redeemed of Christ the bride of Christ singing a song which the Angels cannot imate those are the people I'm talking about tonight and the one I'm telling that is not yet over keep fighting let us keep the fire burning we are going to acquire our Tabernacle amen we are going to receive the Holy Ghost each one of us will be filled with the Holy Ghost each one of us will reach the stage of the perfect each one of us will Beed in his right BL let the devil not tell you that you are nobody that you are the least you are the least among the others every service you rendering the Lord the Lord recogize the seat every song you are singing Ang put it down every testimony you are giv it is written down every service you are doing every money you are paying blessed be the name of the Lord every time you worship when you wake up in the night and you raise your hand because of you and me that he came from Glory he shed his blood and said these are mine and nobody can plug them out of my hands blessed be the name of Lord we are That Never Dies yes sir We are Never Dies we just sleep we sweetly Slumber Believers don't die expect but God gives us what we what he want what is better for us blessed be the name of the Lord and many times the enemy Corners us one time Gideon was cornered and he was so scared and he not know what to do he not know what next but was not yet over God had another plan God spoke to Gideon through his enemy one dream a dream and another one interpreted for the brother and the man of God was there listening praise be to God and then he knew that now is the time talk of the time of the Israelites when in the wall thought that he had them they had no way out blessed be the name of the Lord but there was a young rugged boy in the filing train of God when David slew the bear he didn't know that was a training he didn't know that God Was preparing to face the Giant and when he killed the lion he thought it was over one day be came David crushed it amen and Goliath every single day it was like he was gaining strength blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallu but was not yet over there was a young boy coming with the food for the brothers who had an experience with God and if you have an experience with God no matter what comes your way you will know that this is not the end of me we are not ordinary people we are supernatural being and when we walk in the spirit that's when we shall know that Peter was arrested like any other man he was cast in prison he was just a normal man he was a normal brother he was scared like any of us here would be he was taken in jail he had just had what had happened to Stephan and then he knew that now it was his time but when Peter was in the prison the bre say it can't just end like this God send us more Brothers like that when they hear another brother is in trouble they will not sit and flat they will not sit and back bite and see brother is living in sin it seems living a double standard life may God give us th those Breen like those in the book of Acts who say no no no no no we have just lost Stan we are to lose Peter God that can't happen blessed be the name of the Lord may God raise men and women amen who will hear about such a stuation and come and gather at church and go and gather certain Brothers they said let us pray for brother Mar is undergoing this let us go pray for brother Shing this that is the spirit of Christians that is Christian heart bearing one another's buring and when they began to pray Hallelujah the devil was Wasing amen the devil knows the promise so well even when Christ told Peter that Peter uh Upon This Rock I'll build my [Music] church the devil was there listening was like what where is the rock of course the devil knows does not know Revelation there not this man is been standing on the side is not even a Son of God that's how God works someone sees brother en I have this brother also touch him you see how things will turn upside down blessed be the name of the Lord so when they began to pray the angel said no no and when Peter was there maybe was he was looking at his watch going to be me at around two let me write my because Peter had family praise be to God but the angel said not yet is not yet over amen say there some is praying and that's why I've come I'm getting out of this pron and I'm here to tell you no matter the prison you are in the same Angel of the Lord who liated Peter is still moving in the Church of the Living God to liberate you out of your prison praise be to God when Paul and silus were in prison Hallelujah Paul knew very well not just end like this no sir Hallelujah he remember he went to the constitution of Glory article 47 B amen and then when he was when he opened article 37 B he remembered in Psalms praise the Lord amen all you righteous sing praise those upright amen we started to praise the Lord s us joined him they started singing they started praising maybe they started when things were hard but they pressed on because Paul knew that right from the days of John the Baptist until today this Kingdom saath violence they put violence is in Praise Is In Worship and guess what and then they were trembling around you hear that sure I feel good amen then they kept on praising then again the Shing came out I said Paul let us read another article here oh yes he here they kept on praising and praising and all of a sudden shame fell off their hands their FS were loose blessed be the name of the Lord and maybe the PRI on God was dreaming he was being disturbed in the dream about these men who were in prison Hallelujah not all cops are corrupt not all Spirit security Personnel not all of them sideline with evil some of those men they are innocent some are righteous men and maybe this man knew these men were innocent they just preaching the gospel they want to kill them for nothing blessed be the name of the Lord but in glory something was happening God knew that unless Paul and cus if they had not taken to the prison this man would not hear his name so God took them to prison for that family Hallelujah and Paul knew this man was filled with the Holy Ghost and you know that when you walk in the spirit shall not for the last of Paul was in the spirit he say if I'm to do anything I will do it in the spirit he was in the spirit and maybe him being the prophet of the Gentiles something in his heart told him that we are here for a purpose we are here for a reason but let us just wait upon God s fear not always we are not equivalent in faith we have different measures of faith and the reason us words like that this one of a stronger Faith would have to encourage the one with a weaker faith I believe Paul's Faith was much much higher than C's faith I said my brother don't you worry we are here for a reason blessed be the name of the Lord Paul's the I believe was detecting another theop within there was a deep calling within the I calling within the prison and when this man was maybe sleeping maybe a do do and then he had the earthquake and when he woke up the G the doors were open I was like what have gone away so he pulled his SW he wanted to hurt himself said no sir we are here do not harm yourself and God say that is it blessed be the name of and the man asked him a very nice question to be sa and Paul say believe Jesus Christ your house be saved and the job was done and the men were released out of the pron and that work was done so brother sister before you give up are you sure that God is done with you I am here to tell you if you're not sure it's not yet done God
