[0:19] ephritis
[0:21] or the land of the Hittites and unto the
[0:24] great sea toward the going down of the
[0:26] sun shall be your cost there shall not
[0:30] any man be able to stand before thee or
[0:32] the days of thy life as I was with Moses
[0:35] so I will be with thee I will not fail
[0:38] thee nor forsake thee
[0:41] amen Yeshua is foreign
[1:20] [Music]
[1:31] I'd like to thank God for each of you
[1:33] that have made it today when is the
[1:35] service tonight
[1:40] brother Fred this evening and he desired
[1:43] to be here but he told me he'll be
[1:45] streaming because he was not able to
[1:47] come because it was raining so heavily
[1:49] at their place
[1:57] God bless you I'm gonna have afraid him
[2:00] come out and today this evening I'd like
[2:03] to speak on reflecting
[2:05] on the Promises
[2:14] really I'm going to take a few moments
[2:17] so I would like your undivided attention
[2:22] let us see what the Lord has for us this
[2:25] evening
[2:34] we have come for service
[2:37] you know you cannot drive a car
[2:41] yeah in yeah out without servicing it
[2:46] [Music]
[2:49] do that the engine will knock
[2:53] you cannot drive it anymore
[2:57] oh you need to buy a brand new engine
[3:03] the engine so
[3:08] we also didn't know nothing cannot live
[3:11] as Christians
[3:13] without coming for service
[3:16] we need to change our oil every now and
[3:19] then
[3:21] we need to change this and our filters
[3:27] are you here for service
[3:33] amen Amina and so I pray that as you are
[3:36] here this evening
[3:38] the Lord will speak to you because he
[3:41] knows the desires of your hands
[3:44] I would like us to reflect on the
[3:47] Promises this evening
[3:51] our promises as the children of God
[3:55] and his promises to us Navy soon
[3:59] him as our God yeah
[4:03] I'd like us to look at Joshua here when
[4:08] God is speaking to uh uh when God is
[4:11] speaking to Joshua the same same way he
[4:14] spoke to Moses
[4:21] he said as I was with Moses
[5:21] does God mean those words
[5:23] [Music]
[5:26] now don't look at them as if you were
[5:28] speaking it to Joshua
[5:32] he is speaking to you are you okay
[5:35] because Jesus Christ is the same
[5:37] yesterday today and forever
[5:41] and he says I will not fail thee nor
[5:43] forsake me
[5:46] praise the name of the Lord
[5:49] in Genesis chapter 1 verse 27
[5:53] example God
[5:58] Gathering says he has ever given in a
[6:00] form of a promise to the children or the
[6:03] sons of men
[6:07] on verse 27 he says so God created man
[6:11] in his own image in the image of God
[6:13] created he him male and female created
[6:16] heathens
[6:21] [Music]
[6:23] and God bless them
[6:26] God said unto them be fruitful and
[6:29] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[6:31] subdue it and have dominion over the
[6:33] fish of the sea and over the fall of the
[6:35] air and over every living thing that
[6:37] moveth upon the Earth
[6:55] when the moment God created Man In His
[6:58] Image
[7:01] the very first thing God did
[7:04] he blessed man
[7:08] so let no man ever tell you that God
[7:10] doesn't want to bless you because
[7:15] the purpose and the desire of God is
[7:20] for man to be blessed
[7:24] remember man in his own image
[7:29] if you're walking in the image of God
[7:32] walking in the spirit of God
[7:35] then you are blessed
[7:37] and he says and God said unto them be
[7:40] fruitful
[7:43] now if your feet if you are blessed God
[7:46] wants you to be fruitful
[7:49] and God doesn't want you to remain the
[7:52] same yeah
[7:57] he wants you to multiply
[8:00] and replace
[8:04] and have dominion over the fish
[8:38] God doesn't want you to have only one
[8:40] shot for five years
[8:47] God doesn't want you to have one dress
[8:49] for the whole time
[8:54] God doesn't want us to have a 50 people
[8:57] in the church for five years
[9:02] if you're married God doesn't want you
[9:04] to be without children
[9:08] you see God wants you to multiply it
[9:13] could be same whatever God made in this
[9:15] world he makes it to multiply
[9:20] when he created a black flower
[9:23] he met he made it multiplied yeah
[9:35] and he did red flowers and roses
[9:39] and he makes it in a way that it will be
[9:42] able to multiply yeah
[9:47] comes in the devil always destroyed
[9:50] yes and we have seen the genetically
[9:54] modified foods
[9:58] when you saw them
[10:00] those seeds cannot re uh reply or cannot
[10:05] multiply themselves
[10:08] you cannot plant those seeds again and
[10:12] they will bring forth of their kind
[10:13] again
[10:17] because they are dead to begin with
[10:21] but you see whatever has life
[10:24] it must multiply whatever was created by
[10:29] God
[10:30] it must multiply
[10:32] do you understand what I'm saying if you
[10:36] have a means
[10:40] that means seed must multiply oh
[10:47] foreign
[12:04] [Applause]
[12:08] foreign
[13:08] find out what has gone wrong in your
[13:11] life
[13:13] because the intention and purpose of God
[13:16] for your life
[13:19] is for you to multiply but we could be
[13:22] same is for you to be fruitful
[13:24] one day when Jesus was walking
[13:27] he found a mango tree and this mango
[13:31] tree looks so beautiful
[13:33] but the mango tree did not have one
[13:36] mango on that fruit on that tree
[13:40] and Jesus was not happy with this yes
[13:43] what did he do with it
[13:47] he said because I can't have any fruit
[13:50] from you
[13:54] you will never have any fruit in the
[13:57] days
[14:08] foreign
[14:38] and God has promises
[14:41] and this it is him who spoke it fast
[14:44] before anybody
[14:49] foreign
[14:59] [Music]
[15:18] [Music]
[15:33] [Music]
[15:41] God wants you to ask big things
[15:45] he doesn't want you to be like a petty
[15:48] uh like Petty and juvenile
[15:54] he wants you to ask big things that your
[15:57] choice may be full
[16:00] name
[16:04] God wants to ask for big things
[16:08] not small things
[16:12] how many have big plans
[16:16] what are your big plans
[16:19] this coming year or before this year
[16:22] closes or before the coming of the Lord
[16:26] where do you want to be what will you go
[16:29] to be that where you will be
[16:31] physically and spiritually
[16:33] will be determined by what you want
[16:36] again
[16:38] that God has already given it all to you
[16:42] God has already told you I've given you
[16:45] my blessings
[16:48] and you know the word of God he doesn't
[16:50] need to speak many words
[16:56] he says
[17:01] replenishances
[17:15] now if you go out into the world
[17:19] and they are not able to have dominion
[17:22] and you're not able to multiply
[17:25] you're not able to be fruitful I'm not
[17:28] able to subdue
[17:30] it is not God in the wrong it is you who
[17:33] has not yet found what you want to
[17:36] understand
[17:41] God doesn't want us to be afraid
[17:46] to ask for big things
[17:49] some believers
[17:51] they need to begin asking for big things
[17:56] begin asking for big times
[18:01] praise the name of the Lord
[18:04] tell your neighbor begin asking for big
[18:06] things

[19:21] that your choice may be full yes some of

[23:24] tons of them fish
[23:27] never one they would never drink the
[23:29] water up never worry that wouldn't be
[23:31] too hard
[23:36] how many times could we multiply
[23:41] you could never exhaust God in his
[23:44] powers
[23:49] to his children we can never existence
[24:03] please
[24:05] please go and tell that young man
[24:09] it's almost finishing up my bless the
[24:12] blessing of God is unequenchable
[24:16] today I'm speaking on the Promises
[24:20] reflecting on the Promises
[24:23] reflecting on the blessings of God
[24:27] maybe God knows someone here needs it
[24:30] is
[24:33] let us reason together so God is
[24:36] listening with you today
[24:38] in the form of his word it is up to you
[24:42] if you will hear it and receive it is
[24:46] that praise the name of the Lord you
[24:48] could never exist God in his powers
[24:53] and his message to his children
[24:56] he is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[25:03] and it says
[25:12] amen you can never exhaust the promises
[25:16] and the blessing of God
[25:21] Hallelujah
[25:24] I want you to see the Promise here that
[25:26] he gave to Abraham
[25:29] in Genesis 12 verse
[25:35] now the Lord said unto Abraham get thee
[25:38] out of thy country and from thy Kindred
[25:40] and from thy father's house and to a
[25:42] land that I will show thee and I will
[25:44] make of thee a great nation and are
[25:46] blessed thee and make thy name great and
[25:48] thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[25:50] bless them that bless thee and cast them
[25:52] that cast thee and and thee in indeed
[25:55] shall all the families of the earth be
[25:56] blessed is
[26:36] as I was reading this I was just
[26:39] marveling whenever this is that when God
[26:42] was blessing Abra cartoon
[26:45] he did not withhold anything
[26:47] [Music]
[26:50] progress
[26:51] God
[26:56] blessed Abraham with an abundant
[26:59] blessing he did not withhold
[27:03] he gave him a seven Sevenfold blessings
[27:10] seven some is got this number of
[27:13] Perfections
[27:15] are there are different numbers in the
[27:17] scriptures
[27:20] is is is is number of perfection
[27:25] seven is a number of completions
[27:31] and so we see that seven here was a
[27:34] number of complete completions
[27:39] not Perfection
[27:43] and and
[27:48] was indicating that Abram
[27:52] have given you my full complete blessing
[28:02] I've left nothing
[28:06] Hallelujah man I've given it all to you
[28:11] just like you remember
[28:12] in the same same way when when they uh
[28:17] when Jacob was blessed by his father
[28:22] the father of of of Isaac was Abram each
[28:26] one experience and you know this
[28:29] blessing was going on down the
[28:31] generation
[28:33] and when Jacob received that the
[28:35] simplest thing from from his father
[28:41] isaacsa came running after
[28:44] because there's some little left for me
[28:49] do you remember what he told him I said
[28:53] I'm sorry I've given it all away
[28:56] I don't have even a little less
[29:03] listen to me when God gives you a
[29:07] blessing
[29:09] this Blessing of Abraham um
[29:49] look foreign
[29:52] foreign
[29:56] [Applause]
[30:16] [Applause]
[30:33] you know there's a song that says
[30:40] [Music]
[30:44] this sauce
[30:46] never runs dry
[30:49] it can never run drunk
[30:55] and this sauce is not a religious entity
[31:00] is not a society is not a company
[31:05] it's not a job that you have this source
[31:09] is the blessing of God
[31:13] within this blessing it's not even
[31:16] family inheritance
[31:20] it's not even family inheritance
[31:23] I don't know how many here have some
[31:25] family inheritance
[31:28] some of us never inherited anything from
[31:31] our family
[31:34] not even one inch of a piece of balance
[31:38] but we are blessed by God
[31:41] it's not the blessing of a family family
[31:45] it's not the blessing of the things that
[31:47] you will receive in the world
[31:50] the Bible says you can gain the whole
[31:52] world
[31:57] it's not the things that we gain in the
[31:59] world
[32:01] it is the things that we gain from the
[32:04] supernatural
[32:07] Abraham lost it all right but God gave
[32:11] him a seven-fold blessings
[32:14] I will make the a great nation now
[32:17] foreign
[32:30] each of this blessing is different you
[32:33] know your name is
[32:46] [Applause]
[33:20] foreign
[33:56] Out of Heaven the second time and said
[34:00] by myself I have have I sworn saith the
[34:04] Lord
[34:05] for because thou Hast done this thing
[34:08] and ask not withheld thy son thine only
[34:11] son that in blessing I Will Bless thee
[34:14] and in multiplying I will multiply thy
[34:17] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[34:19] the sand which is upon the sea shore and
[34:21] thy seed shall possess the Gate of his
[34:24] enemies and in thy seed shall all the
[34:27] nations of the earth be blessed because
[34:28] thou has to obeyed my voice is
[34:50] [Music]
[35:05] foreign
[35:32] you know
[35:34] and I often hear from many people about
[35:38] is really hard we are going through hard
[35:42] times
[35:44] for everyone
[35:46] don't think that it's only hard in your
[35:48] home
[35:54] you know the economy is not going well
[35:57] and then the people are suffering
[36:00] financially
[36:02] and you know with many without anything
[36:05] to eat
[36:07] many have even been dying
[36:10] because of starving
[36:13] in this country
[36:15] people have been foreign
[37:24] all those that love his name
[37:28] and listen for all those that are in the
[37:32] promise
[37:34] these promises now I want to reach the
[37:37] crime action good for you and finish so
[37:38] I wanted to listen very careful
[37:41] these promises and I will be finishing
[37:44] the next 30 minutes
[37:46] so these promises
[37:48] are not for everyone
[37:52] these promises are only for those who
[37:56] are inside those promises
[38:02] when God pressed Abraham
[38:05] he told him in blessing
[38:13] as the stars
[38:17] and as the son which is upon the sea
[38:19] show
[38:57] [Applause]
[39:20] through Abraham
[39:46] [Applause]
[40:20] but Jesus
[40:22] YouTube
[40:26] Mina
[40:28] I am one of them is
[40:34] promises
[40:40] all those who receive Christ they
[40:51] are right in this scripture
[40:54] I see it shall possess the Gate of his
[40:57] enemies
[41:03] I was reading this and I was rejoicing
[41:06] so for the remaining part of the service
[41:08] I'll read this quote for you and I want
[41:10] you to listen carefully
[41:14] God lets you get to that last end of the
[41:17] road
[41:22] to the last mile of the way
[41:28] then he steps in get out
[41:34] did you hear that
[41:36] I said did you hear that
[41:40] that's what usually got done
[41:43] he lets you reach at the very last end
[41:46] of the way
[41:49] the last mile yeah
[42:04] if you are a Seed of Abraham
[42:08] obviously believe God it is a cartoon
[42:12] and if you believe these things come on
[42:14] you need to shout a man
[42:16] if you are a seed of God
[42:20] believe God
[42:22] holding his promise for healing
[42:26] hold his promise for salvation
[42:31] of the Holy ghosts
[42:38] God lets you get some time right to the
[42:41] end of the road
[42:45] again and it looks worse than it ever
[42:48] did
[42:51] and the daughter say there is not a
[42:53] chance
[42:58] with a promise you shall possess the
[43:02] Gate of your immigration
