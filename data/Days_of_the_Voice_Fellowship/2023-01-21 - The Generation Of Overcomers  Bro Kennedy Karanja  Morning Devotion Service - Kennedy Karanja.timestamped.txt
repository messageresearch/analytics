[13:18] [Music]
[13:22] okay
[13:25] foreign
[13:28] [Music]
[13:47] [Applause]
[13:59] I'll pray
[14:01] [Music]
[14:16] you know we are singing for them to
[14:19] bring it to the now to impact on the
[14:21] expectation
[14:23] and expectations
[14:25] he'll touch me yeah something is going
[14:29] to happen
[14:32] I believe you're short of time
[14:35] leader for the songs
[14:38] and we just want to be an expectation
[14:41] this morning
[14:43] we just want to be under expectation
[14:44] this morning
[14:46] we thank the Lord for the special
[14:48] singing
[14:49] thank the Lord for each and everyone
[14:52] God bless you so much
[14:55] we just turned to our Bibles
[14:57] in the Book of Psalms chapter five
[15:01] I just have a little thought this
[15:03] morning
[15:07] when the pastor mentioned to me that
[15:12] he requested that I prepare myself for
[15:14] the service today
[15:19] it was such a huge it was had such a
[15:22] huge burden I would say
[15:26] standing here is never usually easy
[15:30] but I trust the Lord shall make it
[15:33] possible for me this morning
[15:37] to stand in the Gap
[15:40] and speak the Oracles of the Lord
[15:44] now the thought that I had
[15:47] most of it was actually preached
[15:49] yesterday
[15:50] yeah
[15:53] to start this morning
[15:57] because I was to read from Joshua
[15:59] chapter six
[16:01] in Hebrews
[16:03] we covered that extensively yeah
[16:07] but I believe there is still they still
[16:10] a small portion
[16:12] that the Lord has reserved for us this
[16:14] day
[16:15] foreign
[16:52] when are you going to take him out of
[16:54] the ocean
[16:56] food so forgive me if you still go
[16:58] through the same same scriptures
[17:00] but I believe
[17:03] being that the awards of eternal life
[17:06] we can never get out of them
[17:09] the book of Psalms chapter five
[17:12] the Lord has just placed something in my
[17:15] heart this morning
[17:17] and I'll just be leaning mostly on the
[17:19] morning side because it's a morning
[17:21] service uh
[17:29] oh Lord consider my meditation
[17:33] foreign
[18:09] and now we come to the most important
[18:11] part of the service
[18:14] where a man moves out of the way
[18:18] and Lord you can come and step in and
[18:20] speak to us as a children we're
[18:23] expecting dear Lord
[18:25] this morning you're going to do
[18:27] something special
[18:29] that you're going to touch us oh God we
[18:32] shall leave this place with an
[18:33] experience
[18:34] that we shall be remembering
[18:37] that on that morning service
[18:39] on 21st of January
[18:42] something happened in my life the Lord
[18:45] touched me the Lord delivered me the
[18:48] Lord Set Me Free the Lord healed me may
[18:52] you do something special this morning
[18:54] Father we thank you and appreciate you
[18:56] Lord as we get into the ministry of the
[18:58] word as I Sovereign myself
[19:16] time has really gone
[19:18] but I trust that the Lord is in control
[19:21] of everything
[19:22] I just want to take some time
[19:28] we have the theme for the meetings
[19:35] the generation of Overcomers
[19:39] blessed be the name of the Lord so even
[19:42] before
[19:44] so even before we continue
[19:47] I want you to even see the prophetic
[19:50] words
[19:52] God is speaking to you today
[19:55] it does not matter your situation it
[19:58] does not matter how things are
[20:00] here but God has already counted you
[20:03] among the generation of Overcomers
[20:06] you see something that people need to
[20:09] know and as Believers we need to raise
[20:12] up to a level where we identify with God
[20:17] the way he identifies with us
[20:20] it does not matter your presence
[20:22] condition look at Adam Adam Adam was the
[20:26] son of God but then
[20:29] and he came into a fallen condition
[20:32] now remember he was falling but though
[20:36] he was falling he was a fallen Son of
[20:40] God
[20:41] good day
[20:43] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus we
[20:45] have the children of Israel they were in
[20:48] bondage they were in captivity
[20:50] regardless of whether they were
[20:53] in Egypt in Babylon we have a place by
[20:59] the Covenant of God
[21:02] and as long as they got in tune with
[21:04] that foreign
[21:33] [Applause]
[21:36] that is the reason why hence when he
[21:39] failed he will still find his way
[21:43] children of God children of God I want
[21:48] to tell you this morning you can find
[21:50] your way you can find your way back
