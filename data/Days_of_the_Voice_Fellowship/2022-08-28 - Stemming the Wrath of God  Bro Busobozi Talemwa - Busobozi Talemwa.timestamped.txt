[1:11:24] is
[1:11:37] and so
[1:11:38] uh i would also like to take the
[1:11:40] opportunity this morning
[1:11:44] to announce the arrival of our baby
[1:11:47] leader
[1:11:53] god answered all your prayers
[1:11:57] and uh on thursday early in the morning
[1:12:04] we left at home probably
[1:12:06] okay well we were here on wednesday
[1:12:09] fellowship
[1:12:12] was in the back there and she was
[1:12:13] raising upper hand
[1:12:17] and so uh when we were going home she
[1:12:19] told me
[1:12:21] i think it has it has begun but really
[1:12:24] nobody can understand so we went back
[1:12:28] home today
[1:12:29] and
[1:12:30] she was still confessing it is
[1:12:33] continuing
[1:12:35] so i said well uh well of course the
[1:12:38] unmarried ones are wondering what was
[1:12:39] going on
[1:12:43] but i know most of you understand
[1:12:45] when she was already in bath pain
[1:12:48] progressing
[1:12:54] in those last moments we did not pray
[1:12:55] much because we are done most of the
[1:12:57] praying here oh what was saying
[1:13:00] to us about this last moment
[1:13:05] came down his promise and his wife who
[1:13:07] make history
[1:13:09] so
[1:13:10] um
[1:13:11] we
[1:13:12] i just kept on watching her
[1:13:15] and uh at around
[1:13:18] okay we
[1:13:19] we thought um you know during our first
[1:13:22] children we would always rush to the
[1:13:23] hospital
[1:13:25] at the first sign
[1:13:26] of us
[1:13:42] uh
[1:13:43] for the contractions to get
[1:13:45] more intense
[1:13:51] this was supposed to be our fifth
[1:13:53] child so we had more experience
[1:13:58] so
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:23] usually all my children it's my mother
[1:14:25] who has them in our hands first
[1:15:08] so
[1:15:24] and everybody happy
[1:15:27] i know i know my wife is dreaming manny
[1:15:29] machado and equality i don't know if
[1:15:31] i've forgotten anything reminding me
[1:15:33] i should say that she appreciates all
[1:15:36] your prayers
[1:15:39] amen and i would trust that next next uh
[1:15:42] sunday she will be here and probably
[1:15:44] will dedicate the child to kids
[1:15:48] praise the lord
[1:15:50] so i'm i'm very happy this morning
[1:15:54] amen i mean because of that
[1:15:56] and also because i'm in the house of the
[1:15:58] lord
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:16:01] praise the name of the lord come here
[1:16:03] well you should be happy with me church
[1:16:12] so let us stand on our feet and we will
[1:16:14] go straight away to the scripture to
[1:16:15] immediately
[1:16:17] individually
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:36] you know it was amazing
[1:16:38] when i took the following day when i
[1:16:39] took all the children to the hospital
[1:16:44] and all the others were all obsessed
[1:16:46] with the child
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:15] holy moly
[1:17:17] and i was like oh my god
[1:17:19] so men should be caring for their women
[1:17:26] exodus chapter 4 verse 24 oh
[1:17:41] i don't know i don't remember who
[1:17:42] started
[1:18:11] said
[1:18:13] so we are taking verse 24 to 26.
[1:18:21] and it came to pass by the way in the
[1:18:24] end that the lord met
[1:18:27] that um excuse me let me read that again
[1:18:30] and it came to pass by the way in the
[1:18:32] inn that the lord met him and so to kill
[1:18:35] him
[1:18:36] then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut
[1:18:39] off the foreskin
[1:18:41] of her son
[1:18:42] and cast it at his feet and said
[1:18:46] surely a bloody husband at a thou to me
[1:18:50] so he let him go then she said a bloody
[1:18:54] husband thou act
[1:18:56] because of the circumcision
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:13] [Music]
[1:19:34] what
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:20:18] and everybody said
[1:20:21] hey my name is
[1:20:31] we just had wonderful a wonderful uh and
[1:20:33] a successful youth meeting on on friday
[1:20:41] and uh
[1:20:42] we had one young lady give a heart to
[1:20:44] the lord is she here yet this morning
[1:20:52] no not yet okay
[1:20:54] so and
[1:20:56] we
[1:20:58] i do not expect to have as much as we
[1:20:59] did now this is
[1:21:01] when about two months
[1:21:02] we had a thought is it for six five and
[1:21:05] we had also others draining in thirty
[1:21:07] three and then others joined in i don't
[1:21:08] know
[1:21:09] but i expected about forty i don't know
[1:21:10] brother did you buy you a guru
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:26] how many young people say we have we had
[1:21:27] a wonderful but
[1:21:29] come and destroy the next city hey man
[1:21:31] and we had a wonderful session of
[1:21:32] questions and answers as well
[1:21:36] that was just the beginning we expect to
[1:21:38] have
[1:21:39] more more times like those in the coming
[1:21:45] so this morning i'll just take a little
[1:21:48] while probably an hour or so and i want
[1:21:51] to speak to you on the subject of
[1:21:53] stemming the wrath of god
[1:22:04] and i'm asking and i'm requesting each
[1:22:07] of you to be attentive remember
[1:22:19] the wrath of god is not something that
[1:22:21] anyone would ever want to be
[1:22:23] in
[1:22:24] there
[1:22:27] the wrath of god is
[1:22:29] dangerous
[1:22:33] and as a matter of fact
[1:22:36] when you read your bible
[1:22:38] the book of malachi which is the last
[1:22:40] chapter
[1:22:42] he gives a promise that god would send
[1:22:44] the spirit of elijah
[1:22:49] and at this election when he comes
[1:23:04] upon the whole world
[1:23:08] in the form of a curse
[1:23:10] so you see
[1:23:12] in all the time of history
[1:23:15] wherever the wrath of god was manifested
[1:23:25] there was a time one time that when god
[1:23:27] destroyed the whole world while the way
[1:23:29] she said i removed
[1:23:31] it
[1:23:32] destroyed it with water i'll tell you
[1:23:34] did you kill his mercy because of the
[1:23:36] wrath
[1:23:38] there was a time when he destroyed twin
[1:23:39] cities what would he say that way
[1:23:41] ezekiel said
[1:23:43] because of the wrath of the world
[1:23:45] so the wrath of god
[1:23:48] cannot be almost i should say cannot be
[1:23:50] stemmed
[1:23:53] it cannot be stopped
[1:23:56] cannot be resisted
[1:23:58] when it comes
[1:24:00] it cannot be resistable that would say
[1:24:02] to someone that pushes you out many
[1:24:04] times you talk about the love of god
[1:24:09] about the grace of god
[1:24:11] but let us talk about
[1:24:40] and god loves me
[1:24:47] [Music]
[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:20] because saul was an instrument in the
[1:25:22] hands of god to manifest the wrath of
[1:25:25] god
[1:25:31] and when he went out there
[1:25:33] she did not do what god told him to do
[1:25:37] i told him go and destroy
[1:25:52] security and he did not do what god told
[1:25:55] him to do
[1:25:57] and did you know that when you come to
[1:25:58] the lord what god wants you to do first
[1:26:01] is to destroy everything
[1:26:32] like we saw on friday everything else is
[1:26:34] vanity
[1:27:17] wants
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:44] shall be our god
[1:27:46] but do many destroy
[1:27:49] many don't destroy it
[1:27:52] you know if god if you do not manifest
[1:27:55] the wrath of god through yourself
[1:28:12] this is how we've seen it all through
[1:28:14] scripture
[1:28:17] praise the name of the lord
[1:28:18] and hear the king's soul
[1:28:21] he did not destroy everything he has
[1:28:23] taken his evolution and he came and he
[1:28:24] was happy
[1:28:26] and then the prophet
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:41] when we come in the presence of god
[1:28:44] we forget that god knows everything
[1:28:48] god sees everything
[1:28:51] and god knows life more than you know it
[1:28:54] i take a turn
[1:29:21] you know the wrath of god was made
[1:29:25] and you know he went after this prophet
[1:29:27] nagging they wanna be because the
[1:29:29] prophet told him what about the bleeding
[1:29:30] and the you know of the cows and the
[1:29:32] sound of the animals
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:51] this to our god he knows that
[1:29:55] he brought those things
[1:29:57] but god is one who has destroyed it
[1:30:03] and his eye is with us
[1:30:17] and so he came to a prophet of god
[1:30:20] and he was seeking for help
[1:30:23] and when it came to elijah right there
[1:30:25] where is he he told him
[1:30:27] you have to go i'm gonna
[1:30:29] and dip yourself in river george
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:27] and when you don't believe it
[1:31:42] came to this uh norman
[1:31:46] and uh
[1:31:52] please why don't you obey
[1:31:55] that you never know what may happen
[1:31:57] about just go and do as the man of god
[1:32:02] you know god
[1:32:03] that's what the scripture says
[1:32:06] he reveals his
[1:32:08] word his secrets
[1:32:33] he reveals his word to you
[1:32:36] because you are humble
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:52] listen to the girl nominee here we need
[1:32:54] his wallet and he went
[1:32:56] and dipped himself seven times knocking
[1:32:58] on a new car
[1:32:59] and he became
[1:33:02] and as soon as he left
[1:33:04] he came to the man of god
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:34] we know it's not me it's not anybody
[1:33:37] that does anything for you
[1:33:41] when you leave the world
[1:33:44] the world has its results
[1:34:02] so
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:30] there was another
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:42] is that right
[1:34:44] and girls were always preaching with his
[1:34:48] pastor elisha
[1:34:51] that was the new preacher
[1:34:55] remember at one time
[1:34:57] elijah was with elijah in this science
[1:35:00] but now it was time for elijah to now
[1:35:03] minister but she said that earlier i
[1:35:06] will say the spirit of elijah had come
[1:35:08] upon elijah oh my god he agreed with
[1:35:10] request and so as i know
[1:35:39] i believe that the pastor was
[1:35:51] don't you think
[1:35:53] we have wasted
[1:36:08] and
[1:36:37] as if he was a messenger from elections
[1:36:42] and he said again the man of god has
[1:36:45] sent me
[1:36:46] turned unto me to tell you in the name
[1:36:48] of the lord
[1:36:49] that he has changed his mind over there
[1:36:52] actually give him some of those things
[1:36:54] you have muslim welcome
[1:36:56] praise the name of the lord
[1:36:58] those are the future many preachers we
[1:36:59] have on the pulpits today
[1:37:04] they tell you to give seats okay
[1:37:08] why aren't you everybody with a second
[1:37:10] goal
[1:37:12] so that you also can check you
[1:37:16] those are not inspired by god
[1:37:32] where
[1:37:46] also
[1:37:48] and that means his servant cutting
[1:37:50] zombie way i will take it to him
[1:37:54] come and say praise god come here
[1:37:57] finally he has accepted my offer
[1:37:59] so gave it to him
[1:38:02] as he they were giving it to him anymore
[1:38:05] he was also i think giving it some voice
[1:38:09] and then
[1:38:10] he carried it
[1:38:13] he walked our majestically
[1:38:29] by and i believe he maybe people have
[1:38:31] loved putting things under the bed and
[1:38:33] tobacco and you take him into a switch
[1:38:35] stand i also don't know what is under
[1:38:36] your belt
[1:38:39] you must not have things under the
[1:38:40] command and i've been touring watch it
[1:38:42] see
[1:39:10] oh
[1:39:24] do you mean that my spirit did not go
[1:39:25] with you oh god you're going to go
[1:39:27] against inaudible
[1:39:29] you think i was not there oh there was a
[1:39:31] sabbath day do you think my eyes was
[1:39:33] nothing it was amazing
[1:39:35] he failed to understand he hadn't made
[1:39:37] it he was not elijah
[1:40:06] god
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:34] don't get an angry like this what tell
[1:40:37] me a lie no neema and you have deceived
[1:40:40] no need and the god only collected these
[1:40:42] things
[1:40:44] now
[1:40:45] let the class let you know which was
[1:41:12] i want you to see we can go and talk
[1:41:14] about many examples in the bible
[1:41:21] you know when god sent uh
[1:41:24] when god sent uh
[1:41:27] this man that went to nineveh catholic
[1:41:30] honor hey again
[1:41:44] if
[1:42:11] so it means that my words
[1:42:23] again the
[1:42:26] currencies and as he was in a border
[1:42:29] fish
[1:42:30] again
[1:42:31] god said hey
[1:42:34] i was going to bring upon the heavens
[1:42:38] let me begin with you now
[1:42:54] with him
[1:42:57] hallelujah amen and and so god
[1:43:00] brought all his wrath upon him
[1:43:04] let me tell you to eat to the extent
[1:43:08] there
[1:43:22] wrath of god was not true
[1:43:25] when the wrath of god comes it has come
[1:43:27] off
[1:43:30] they put everything in there in the
[1:43:31] scene
[1:43:33] but the wrath of god continues
[1:43:35] and jonah was there
[1:43:50] i am just like any of you
[1:43:53] okay
[1:43:54] let us say let us cast lots
[1:44:11] they count and then until when they
[1:44:14] reach the last person
[1:44:16] they were counting
[1:44:18] and as the
[1:44:32] not
[1:44:46] the voice of god
[1:44:59] he said to them
[1:46:19] and at that moment he begged to be
[1:46:21] stoned in the sea if you thought he was
[1:46:23] going to die yes
[1:46:26] i don't know where this fish came from
[1:46:32] you know it is almost impossible for a
[1:46:33] fish to swallow a human being
[1:46:38] i don't know if your world can somebody
[1:46:39] know about who what is someone
[1:46:41] i really don't know but
[1:46:43] i i i even believe this fish
[1:46:47] must have been a special fish
[1:46:51] god maybe created it for that moment
[1:47:07] the fish was ready
[1:47:10] don't think this was a better a better
[1:47:11] punishment
[1:47:14] you think that
[1:47:16] living in the in the belly of the fish
[1:47:48] so here is
[1:47:57] and uh
[1:47:59] before we we get into what she had done
[1:48:08] in genesis 17 open up your bible to
[1:48:10] genesis 17 verse 9.
[1:48:15] and god said unto abraham thou shalt
[1:48:17] keep my covenant therefore thou and thy
[1:48:20] seed after thee in their generations
[1:48:22] this is my covenant which is between me
[1:48:25] and you and i seed after thee
[1:48:28] every man child among you shall be
[1:48:30] circumcised and he shall circumcise the
[1:48:33] flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a
[1:48:35] talking of the covenant betwixt me and
[1:48:37] you and he that is eight days old shall
[1:48:39] be circumcised among you every man child
[1:48:42] in your generations he that is born in
[1:48:45] the house or brought boat with money of
[1:48:48] any stranger which is not of thy seed he
[1:48:51] that is born in the house and he that is
[1:48:53] bought with money must needs be
[1:48:55] circumcised and my confidence shall be
[1:48:57] in your flesh for an everlasting
[1:48:59] covenant and the answer comes says man
[1:49:02] child who the flesh of his first kin is
[1:49:04] not circumcised that soul shall be cut
[1:49:07] off
[1:49:08] from his people
[1:49:17] [Music]
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:50:47] foreign
[1:50:52] now i wanted to follow me closely here
[1:50:56] i wanted to see that this was the mark
[1:50:58] of the covenant
[1:51:01] god had made a covenant with
[1:51:04] israel it was
[1:51:07] by this come because of this confidence
[1:51:10] that god was sending moses down to egypt
[1:51:15] a mystery
[1:51:16] it was because of that covenant that he
[1:51:18] had remembered
[1:51:46] circumcision
[1:51:49] every boy that was born was supposed to
[1:51:51] be circumstances
[1:51:55] blood was supposed to be spilled
[1:51:58] that was the sign of a convenience
[1:52:14] off would be cut off from his people
[1:52:17] because they would have broken the
[1:52:19] covenants
[1:52:21] and so here now katrina moses god is
[1:52:24] calling here tonight
[1:52:26] to go and deliver the covenant people
[1:52:28] from egypt
[1:52:42] but
[1:52:57] of moses was going to enforce
[1:53:00] the law of god
[1:53:05] he was a part of the covenant
[1:53:08] but he himself was not an example
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:25] moses
[1:53:26] and and i was just reading there's a
[1:53:28] portion i found and i thought i thought
[1:53:30] it was a very good question and i'll
[1:53:31] read it out to you
[1:53:35] and this man wrote and said these are
[1:53:37] things that are true he said first of
[1:53:38] all yahweh can again make sokka this
[1:53:41] instant or cause when moses and his
[1:53:43] family are heading down to egypt
[1:53:48] to deliver god's message to pharaoh and
[1:53:50] to lead the israelites
[1:54:04] and he said the best is forgot his
[1:54:05] intervention on israel's behalf here in
[1:54:08] exodus is the convenient promises he had
[1:54:11] made to abraham
[1:54:15] um
[1:54:36] are you following me now
[1:54:40] listen
[1:54:42] and the sign of circumcision was an
[1:54:45] obligation of this covenant for every
[1:54:47] male decent descendant
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:54:58] so this
[1:54:59] he said in fact the lord had said that
[1:55:01] any son who was not circumcised on the
[1:55:03] 8th day would be cut off from his people
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:12] because he has broken my covenant
[1:55:16] now this means that mothers and sons
[1:55:17] were supposed to be circumcised in
[1:55:19] obedience to god his command
[1:55:25] and as a demonstration of his faith in
[1:55:27] god is covenant with abraham
[1:55:42] moses apparently believed god is
[1:57:00] and everything you remember what god the
[1:57:02] experience of mothers in the burning
[1:57:03] bush and when he met god but you
[1:57:05] couldn't think of your muscle we are
[1:57:07] seeing hannah catonda but with all that
[1:57:10] now yeah maybe you're not a few verses
[1:57:11] down the line whoa
[1:57:16] who did god forget
[1:57:18] the conversation you had with moses
[1:57:21] she comes down
[1:57:22] and
[1:57:36] i'm going
[1:57:50] your
[1:58:16] and there is something there is no
[1:58:18] covenant with that blood
[1:58:21] in the garden
[1:58:23] every covenant of god has blood with it
[1:58:28] are you listening to me
[1:58:30] if someone is closing around you slap
[1:58:32] them and wake them up or else yourself
[1:58:33] will be dusting in there
[1:58:39] praise the name of the lord
[1:58:40] god has the confidence
[1:58:43] he has made
[1:58:44] but that confidence
[1:58:46] is now
[1:58:59] is
[1:59:43] avocados
[1:59:44] who rush yet you can't believe the word
[1:59:46] of god and kiss the chicken but you
[1:59:48] quickly run and have to come
[1:59:50] and
[1:59:52] mash the child i don't know where the
[1:59:53] child is
[2:00:51] you have a covenant with god
[2:01:35] blood on it and you come inside and it's
[2:01:37] not a lot of
[2:01:41] of one messiah
[2:01:56] amen hallelujah
[2:01:58] and that blood style stems gordon's
[2:02:01] wrath good shower
[2:02:05] praise the name of the lord come on and
[2:02:07] the prophet in the message israel and
[2:02:08] the church not be more saying
[2:02:10] afghanistan he says now later again
[2:02:13] we find out that moses got all busy in
[2:02:15] his clash of works
[2:02:28] he was taking right on the eve of
[2:02:30] deliverance
[2:02:34] he was taking his son down in egypt and
[2:02:36] circumcised
[2:02:38] anyway
[2:02:42] god would have slayed him in the inn and
[2:02:44] as
[2:02:58] you see
[2:02:59] before
[2:03:00] there can be deliverance every person
[2:03:03] must be in the covenant
[2:03:09] because god is got a covenant today
[2:03:40] were how motto they've got to get away
[2:03:44] when we're never kind in our body
[2:03:47] right now
[2:03:48] they've got to find favor before god
[2:03:51] foreign
[2:04:09] buy you the favor of god one way
[2:04:14] that's an instance
[2:04:16] hallelujah amen and they wanted favor
[2:04:19] before god
[2:04:20] enough
[2:04:21] they go out and get some different ones
[2:04:23] and get the fruits of the field
[2:04:29] and suffer to make a sacrifice
[2:04:32] to try and appease the wrath of god
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:05:00] and there was something which was called
[2:05:02] powering of liberation
[2:05:18] when they are drinking their alcohol
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:27] or whatever it is
[2:05:29] they will first power down person
[2:05:32] before they dream
[2:05:35] and then they drink
[2:05:37] that's how they used to do it in african
[2:05:39] traditions
[2:05:42] what was that charity they were trying
[2:05:44] to appease the gods
[2:06:01] with a coke without any any whatever
[2:06:03] spot in it
[2:06:06] praise the name of the lord
[2:06:08] what was that
[2:06:10] peace the god
[2:06:13] in the devil that don't do anything but
[2:06:14] what he has seen with god
[2:06:21] to be of peace with sacrifices
[2:06:25] let me tell you our god two love
[2:06:28] sacrifices
[2:06:30] and you cannot appease him
[2:06:33] without the sacrifice
[2:06:35] that's why in church mechanisms
[2:06:39] are sacrificed
[2:06:42] we shout
[2:06:56] me
[2:06:58] but you see
[2:06:59] they all saw er cain went and
[2:07:02] blessed some fruits
[2:07:06] to appease the wrath of god
[2:07:10] and the judgments
[2:07:22] [Music]
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:34] [Applause]
[2:07:39] was just as religious
[2:07:43] as any gentleman
[2:07:45] now in every respect that happened
[2:07:49] when they begin singing
[2:07:51] i pray
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:34] but his mercy why would i
[2:08:37] see that queen am i preaching to someone
[2:08:39] here today
[2:08:40] hallelujah amen we are not served by our
[2:08:43] words we have to call us
[2:08:46] by works
[2:08:48] okay without
[2:09:44] it is not what you do that serves you
[2:09:46] church
[2:09:49] it is what he has done
[2:09:53] and what has he done
[2:09:56] oh hallelujah hallelujah there is only
[2:09:58] one difference
[2:10:00] in the sacrifice
[2:10:05] am i preaching to you today
[2:10:07] no there's only one difference brother
[2:10:09] why do you enjoy your program within the
[2:10:11] sacrifice
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:54] ah
[2:11:08] up
[2:11:21] but the revelation of of of abel wars
[2:11:27] it had something to do with blood
[2:11:31] blood mixed someone oh messiah
[2:11:34] blood was mixed
[2:11:36] with
[2:11:50] wow
[2:12:03] um
[2:12:04] [Music]
[2:12:28] [Applause]
[2:12:32] why did i even lose all those pleasures
[2:12:36] when i cannot even get his favor and get
[2:12:38] somebody in the front of ganja do you
[2:12:39] think you get the favor of god because
[2:12:41] of what you're doing
[2:12:45] get revelation of what was done right
[2:12:47] now
[2:12:50] the father of god
[2:12:52] stems the wrath of god
[2:12:55] with the right revelation
[2:12:58] with the right covenant
[2:13:42] is
[2:13:53] and by the time you go home
[2:14:10] seek you kill and i am you don't know
[2:14:12] nothing about your mind
[2:14:15] let me tell you
[2:14:17] why we believe in a church with lives
[2:14:20] to kill them can you say any moment
[2:14:21] because we give sacrifices of praise a
[2:14:24] ring
[2:15:00] and many christians and many messenger
[2:15:01] believers let me call it that way
[2:15:07] they think i don't want this our works
[2:15:12] it is not in our works
[2:15:15] if it is his mask
[2:15:17] it is his mask because
[2:15:19] it is his sacrifice
[2:15:21] our works can never be good enough
[2:15:26] but he is looking for the sacrifice made
[2:15:28] according to the covenant
[2:15:33] our what
[2:15:49] children
[2:15:52] because after all addressed us and saved
[2:15:54] them
[2:16:02] our works or your works don't save you
[2:16:05] every corner of your quran
[2:16:07] you do your works
[2:16:10] in recognition
[2:16:13] that god has made with you guys
[2:16:18] is the name of the lord man
[2:16:20] so it is the recognition of the covenant
[2:16:25] that saves you
[2:16:28] church
[2:16:29] hebrews 9 everybody open your bibles
[2:16:30] hebrews 9 22.
[2:16:35] and almost all things are by the law
[2:16:37] purged with the blood and without
[2:16:38] shedding of blood is not remission
[2:16:40] it was there often necessary that the
[2:16:42] patterns of things in the heavens should
[2:16:45] be purified with these but the heavenly
[2:16:47] things themselves with better sacrifices
[2:16:49] than these
[2:16:50] for christ is not entered into the holy
[2:16:53] places made with hands which are the
[2:16:55] figures of the true but into the heaven
[2:16:58] itself now to appear in the presence of
[2:17:01] god for us
[2:17:12] [Music]
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:26] a
[2:17:34] know yet
[2:17:36] that he should offer himself off
[2:17:39] as the high priest
[2:17:40] entereth into the holy place every year
[2:17:43] with the blood of others
[2:17:45] for then must he often have suffered
[2:17:48] since the foundation of the world but
[2:17:50] now once in the end of the world has he
[2:17:53] appeared to put our sin by the sacrifice
[2:17:56] of himself
[2:17:57] and as it is appointed unto men wants to
[2:17:59] die but after this the judgment so
[2:18:01] christ was once offered to bear the sins
[2:18:03] of many and unto them that look for him
[2:18:06] shall he appear
[2:18:08] the second time without seeing unto
[2:18:10] salvation
[2:18:22] okay
[2:19:18] the lower part with blood
[2:19:20] era
[2:19:24] without shedding of blood there is no
[2:19:26] remission
[2:19:30] please can you tell your neighbor
[2:19:31] without shredding your blood that is
[2:20:14] for america but jesus
[2:20:17] said he did not need to do that
[2:20:19] because the bible says
[2:20:20] when he came down to earth
[2:20:22] he died once on the cross
[2:20:25] and he died once and for all
[2:20:40] if you feel you are insufficient well
[2:20:42] what are you doing
[2:21:35] jesus neither circumcision avail of
[2:21:37] anything no uncircumcision but a new
[2:21:39] creature
[2:21:40] and as many as walk according to the
[2:21:42] rule to this rule peace be on them and
[2:21:44] mercy and upon the israel of god from
[2:21:47] henceforth let no man trouble me pry
[2:21:50] bear in my body the marks of the lord
[2:21:52] jesus
[2:22:32] hallelujah
[2:22:34] praise the name of the lord amen there
[2:22:36] was circumcision
[2:22:38] why didn't that work come on as the mark
[2:22:41] of the covenant
[2:22:43] okay your body is saying you don't even
[2:22:45] need to be circumcising
[2:23:01] god was going to kill someone because of
[2:23:03] circumstances
[2:23:08] it's not my circumcision
[2:23:12] you put a mark on my body
[2:23:15] jesus christ has already received a mark
[2:23:17] on his body yes
[2:23:20] i bear the marks in my body i bear the
[2:23:23] marks of the lord jesus
[2:23:28] said if any man in christ is a new
[2:23:30] creation
[2:23:34] that is a new creature
[2:23:37] the works i did in the past singing to
[2:23:39] be an accredited whatever i did in the
[2:23:40] past does not count you're not being
[2:23:42] according to that eventually no matter

[2:25:35] and then god will see you
