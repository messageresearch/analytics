we are glad to have you here um i'm also happy to see you uh brother dixon for collaborating with dickson brother dixon uh joined us when we are still in the in the home fellowship those are one of the first believers in this chat is and so uh i would also like to take the opportunity this morning to announce the arrival of our baby leader god answered all your prayers and uh on thursday early in the morning we left at home probably okay well we were here on wednesday fellowship was in the back there and she was raising upper hand and so uh when we were going home she told me i think it has it has begun but really nobody can understand so we went back home today and she was still confessing it is continuing so i said well uh well of course the unmarried ones are wondering what was going on but i know most of you understand when she was already in bath pain progressing in those last moments we did not pray much because we are done most of the praying here oh what was saying to us about this last moment came down his promise and his wife who make history so um we i just kept on watching her and uh at around okay we we thought um you know during our first children we would always rush to the hospital at the first sign of us uh for the contractions to get more intense this was supposed to be our fifth child so we had more experience so [Music] [Music] usually all my children it's my mother who has them in our hands first so and everybody happy i know i know my wife is dreaming manny machado and equality i don't know if i've forgotten anything reminding me i should say that she appreciates all your prayers amen and i would trust that next next uh sunday she will be here and probably will dedicate the child to kids praise the lord so i'm i'm very happy this morning amen i mean because of that and also because i'm in the house of the lord [Music] praise the name of the lord come here well you should be happy with me church so let us stand on our feet and we will go straight away to the scripture to immediately individually [Music] you know it was amazing when i took the following day when i took all the children to the hospital and all the others were all obsessed with the child [Music] holy moly and i was like oh my god so men should be caring for their women exodus chapter 4 verse 24 oh i don't know i don't remember who started said so we are taking verse 24 to 26. and it came to pass by the way in the end that the lord met that um excuse me let me read that again and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him and so to kill him then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband at a thou to me so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou act because of the circumcision [Music] [Music] what [Music] and everybody said hey my name is we just had wonderful a wonderful uh and a successful youth meeting on on friday and uh we had one young lady give a heart to the lord is she here yet this morning no not yet okay so and we i do not expect to have as much as we did now this is when about two months we had a thought is it for six five and we had also others draining in thirty three and then others joined in i don't know but i expected about forty i don't know brother did you buy you a guru [Music] how many young people say we have we had a wonderful but come and destroy the next city hey man and we had a wonderful session of questions and answers as well that was just the beginning we expect to have more more times like those in the coming so this morning i'll just take a little while probably an hour or so and i want to speak to you on the subject of stemming the wrath of god and i'm asking and i'm requesting each of you to be attentive remember the wrath of god is not something that anyone would ever want to be in there the wrath of god is dangerous and as a matter of fact when you read your bible the book of malachi which is the last chapter he gives a promise that god would send the spirit of elijah and at this election when he comes upon the whole world in the form of a curse so you see in all the time of history wherever the wrath of god was manifested there was a time one time that when god destroyed the whole world while the way she said i removed it destroyed it with water i'll tell you did you kill his mercy because of the wrath there was a time when he destroyed twin cities what would he say that way ezekiel said because of the wrath of the world so the wrath of god cannot be almost i should say cannot be stemmed it cannot be stopped cannot be resisted when it comes it cannot be resistable that would say to someone that pushes you out many times you talk about the love of god about the grace of god but let us talk about and god loves me [Music] [Applause] because saul was an instrument in the hands of god to manifest the wrath of god and when he went out there she did not do what god told him to do i told him go and destroy security and he did not do what god told him to do and did you know that when you come to the lord what god wants you to do first is to destroy everything like we saw on friday everything else is vanity wants [Music] shall be our god but do many destroy many don't destroy it you know if god if you do not manifest the wrath of god through yourself this is how we've seen it all through scripture praise the name of the lord and hear the king's soul he did not destroy everything he has taken his evolution and he came and he was happy and then the prophet [Music] when we come in the presence of god we forget that god knows everything god sees everything and god knows life more than you know it i take a turn you know the wrath of god was made and you know he went after this prophet nagging they wanna be because the prophet told him what about the bleeding and the you know of the cows and the sound of the animals [Music] this to our god he knows that he brought those things but god is one who has destroyed it and his eye is with us and so he came to a prophet of god and he was seeking for help and when it came to elijah right there where is he he told him you have to go i'm gonna and dip yourself in river george [Music] [Music] and when you don't believe it came to this uh norman and uh please why don't you obey that you never know what may happen about just go and do as the man of god you know god that's what the scripture says he reveals his word his secrets he reveals his word to you because you are humble [Music] listen to the girl nominee here we need his wallet and he went and dipped himself seven times knocking on a new car and he became and as soon as he left he came to the man of god [Music] we know it's not me it's not anybody that does anything for you when you leave the world the world has its results so [Music] there was another [Music] is that right and girls were always preaching with his pastor elisha that was the new preacher remember at one time elijah was with elijah in this science but now it was time for elijah to now minister but she said that earlier i will say the spirit of elijah had come upon elijah oh my god he agreed with request and so as i know i believe that the pastor was don't you think we have wasted and as if he was a messenger from elections and he said again the man of god has sent me turned unto me to tell you in the name of the lord that he has changed his mind over there actually give him some of those things you have muslim welcome praise the name of the lord those are the future many preachers we have on the pulpits today they tell you to give seats okay why aren't you everybody with a second goal so that you also can check you those are not inspired by god where also and that means his servant cutting zombie way i will take it to him come and say praise god come here finally he has accepted my offer so gave it to him as he they were giving it to him anymore he was also i think giving it some voice and then he carried it he walked our majestically by and i believe he maybe people have loved putting things under the bed and tobacco and you take him into a switch stand i also don't know what is under your belt you must not have things under the command and i've been touring watch it see oh do you mean that my spirit did not go with you oh god you're going to go against inaudible you think i was not there oh there was a sabbath day do you think my eyes was nothing it was amazing he failed to understand he hadn't made it he was not elijah god [Music] don't get an angry like this what tell me a lie no neema and you have deceived no need and the god only collected these things now let the class let you know which was i want you to see we can go and talk about many examples in the bible you know when god sent uh when god sent uh this man that went to nineveh catholic honor hey again if so it means that my words again the currencies and as he was in a border fish again god said hey i was going to bring upon the heavens let me begin with you now with him hallelujah amen and and so god brought all his wrath upon him let me tell you to eat to the extent there wrath of god was not true when the wrath of god comes it has come off they put everything in there in the scene but the wrath of god continues and jonah was there i am just like any of you okay let us say let us cast lots they count and then until when they reach the last person they were counting and as the not the voice of god he said to them and at that moment he begged to be stoned in the sea if you thought he was going to die yes i don't know where this fish came from you know it is almost impossible for a fish to swallow a human being i don't know if your world can somebody know about who what is someone i really don't know but i i i even believe this fish must have been a special fish god maybe created it for that moment the fish was ready don't think this was a better a better punishment you think that living in the in the belly of the fish so here is and uh before we we get into what she had done in genesis 17 open up your bible to genesis 17 verse 9. and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which is between me and you and i seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and he shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a talking of the covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or brought boat with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed he that is born in the house and he that is bought with money must needs be circumcised and my confidence shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the answer comes says man child who the flesh of his first kin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign now i wanted to follow me closely here i wanted to see that this was the mark of the covenant god had made a covenant with israel it was by this come because of this confidence that god was sending moses down to egypt a mystery it was because of that covenant that he had remembered circumcision every boy that was born was supposed to be circumstances blood was supposed to be spilled that was the sign of a convenience off would be cut off from his people because they would have broken the covenants and so here now katrina moses god is calling here tonight to go and deliver the covenant people from egypt but of moses was going to enforce the law of god he was a part of the covenant but he himself was not an example [Music] moses and and i was just reading there's a portion i found and i thought i thought it was a very good question and i'll read it out to you and this man wrote and said these are things that are true he said first of all yahweh can again make sokka this instant or cause when moses and his family are heading down to egypt to deliver god's message to pharaoh and to lead the israelites and he said the best is forgot his intervention on israel's behalf here in exodus is the convenient promises he had made to abraham um are you following me now listen and the sign of circumcision was an obligation of this covenant for every male decent descendant [Music] so this he said in fact the lord had said that any son who was not circumcised on the 8th day would be cut off from his people [Music] because he has broken my covenant now this means that mothers and sons were supposed to be circumcised in obedience to god his command and as a demonstration of his faith in god is covenant with abraham moses apparently believed god is and everything you remember what god the experience of mothers in the burning bush and when he met god but you couldn't think of your muscle we are seeing hannah catonda but with all that now yeah maybe you're not a few verses down the line whoa who did god forget the conversation you had with moses she comes down and i'm going your and there is something there is no covenant with that blood in the garden every covenant of god has blood with it are you listening to me if someone is closing around you slap them and wake them up or else yourself will be dusting in there praise the name of the lord god has the confidence he has made but that confidence is now is avocados who rush yet you can't believe the word of god and kiss the chicken but you quickly run and have to come and mash the child i don't know where the child is you have a covenant with god blood on it and you come inside and it's not a lot of of one messiah amen hallelujah and that blood style stems gordon's wrath good shower praise the name of the lord come on and the prophet in the message israel and the church not be more saying afghanistan he says now later again we find out that moses got all busy in his clash of works he was taking right on the eve of deliverance he was taking his son down in egypt and circumcised anyway god would have slayed him in the inn and as you see before there can be deliverance every person must be in the covenant because god is got a covenant today were how motto they've got to get away when we're never kind in our body right now they've got to find favor before god foreign buy you the favor of god one way that's an instance hallelujah amen and they wanted favor before god enough they go out and get some different ones and get the fruits of the field and suffer to make a sacrifice to try and appease the wrath of god [Music] and there was something which was called powering of liberation when they are drinking their alcohol [Music] or whatever it is they will first power down person before they dream and then they drink that's how they used to do it in african traditions what was that charity they were trying to appease the gods with a coke without any any whatever spot in it praise the name of the lord what was that peace the god in the devil that don't do anything but what he has seen with god to be of peace with sacrifices let me tell you our god two love sacrifices and you cannot appease him without the sacrifice that's why in church mechanisms are sacrificed we shout me but you see they all saw er cain went and blessed some fruits to appease the wrath of god and the judgments [Music] [Music] [Applause] was just as religious as any gentleman now in every respect that happened when they begin singing i pray [Music] but his mercy why would i see that queen am i preaching to someone here today hallelujah amen we are not served by our words we have to call us by works okay without it is not what you do that serves you church it is what he has done and what has he done oh hallelujah hallelujah there is only one difference in the sacrifice am i preaching to you today no there's only one difference brother why do you enjoy your program within the sacrifice [Music] ah up but the revelation of of of abel wars it had something to do with blood blood mixed someone oh messiah blood was mixed with wow um [Music] [Applause] why did i even lose all those pleasures when i cannot even get his favor and get somebody in the front of ganja do you think you get the favor of god because of what you're doing get revelation of what was done right now the father of god stems the wrath of god with the right revelation with the right covenant is and by the time you go home seek you kill and i am you don't know nothing about your mind let me tell you why we believe in a church with lives to kill them can you say any moment because we give sacrifices of praise a ring and many christians and many messenger believers let me call it that way they think i don't want this our works it is not in our works if it is his mask it is his mask because it is his sacrifice our works can never be good enough but he is looking for the sacrifice made according to the covenant our what children because after all addressed us and saved them our works or your works don't save you every corner of your quran you do your works in recognition that god has made with you guys is the name of the lord man so it is the recognition of the covenant that saves you church hebrews 9 everybody open your bibles hebrews 9 22. and almost all things are by the law purged with the blood and without shedding of blood is not remission it was there often necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into the heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us [Music] [Music] a know yet that he should offer himself off as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with the blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put our sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men wants to die but after this the judgment so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without seeing unto salvation okay the lower part with blood era without shedding of blood there is no remission please can you tell your neighbor without shredding your blood that is for america but jesus said he did not need to do that because the bible says when he came down to earth he died once on the cross and he died once and for all if you feel you are insufficient well what are you doing jesus neither circumcision avail of anything no uncircumcision but a new creature and as many as walk according to the rule to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god from henceforth let no man trouble me pry bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus hallelujah praise the name of the lord amen there was circumcision why didn't that work come on as the mark of the covenant okay your body is saying you don't even need to be circumcising god was going to kill someone because of circumstances it's not my circumcision you put a mark on my body jesus christ has already received a mark on his body yes i bear the marks in my body i bear the marks of the lord jesus said if any man in christ is a new creation that is a new creature the works i did in the past singing to be an accredited whatever i did in the past does not count you're not being according to that eventually no matter what you have that's why i am preaching to you i am a simple messenger of god i am a preacher anointed by the word i'm here to tell you the things you have done in your life as long as you can place them under the block i will not count at all why right she got this blood i'm speaking hallelujah the blessings are marking your life oh messiah came from it becomes the mark of the convention and when the angel of wrath was through when the wrath of god comes and then god
