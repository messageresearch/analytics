before him you're praying for and i've been believing for and it is taking too long to manifest because god wants to show his signs amina and god sometimes happens the people and the things around us so that he can manifest his signs on and god does son and of thy son his son what things i have wrote in egypt and my signs which i have done among them that he may know how that i am the lord a rodeo body [Music] are you here church can you savannah and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long will thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people i'm happy to see you my name is saying and i was you know sharing with a little bit and i think in the coming weeks i will take a a subject on uh well i'll just keep it for now but there's something i want to speak on in the coming weeks and uh for the church to educate the church as believers need to know where we stand finger that kid is actually not money our way to immediate death no if we do not have roots then you cannot grow if you are tossed to and fro whatever amen i mean and we see that god spoke to uh moses and aaron and spoke to them and say that a mother-son aaron came in under fire and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long will that refuse to humble thyself before me are you following me these hebrews we are different people barrio and juventus god had called them and separated them from all the different manner of people on earth and he had anointed them after fulfilling tell me that he was in one of the conferences well there was also the ambassador just recently whether it was also the ambassador of israel and they were speaking about the ethiopian jews the specific group groups of them are kevin jackson that live in the northern parts of the country that pe and people dislike them and one of them brother was telling me that they the the people think about all kind of things these people are accused you know because they will just look at you and you can be cast no furniture was try and see how they can get them back maybe to their homeland or to try and see how they can be able to live and cohabit these people but you see what the people this man told me it is in his words i'm commenting he said no wonder in our country we've been cast because how can they treat the jews that way by yourself at you you see let me tell you this is the promise of god election do you believe in god catholic i believe in the god of the bible by the god of the bible catholic bible is actually the god of abraham the god of the bible is the god of isaac the god of [Applause] you find the jewish uh five-star flag of david but you get the mechanism have you seen that before some of you are wondering that's the reason whether you believe it or not that's what the bible says are you bible believers that's what the bible says hallelujah amen i am for israel support israel not because i want to sing but because the bible that i believe tells me too the bible tells us to pray it doesn't say pray for the peace of uganda bible hallelujah and so here they were in egypt and god did not want them to stay in egypt [Music] do you know the reason why because there was a purpose on their life they were not created to build egypt hello church and i'll tell you that egypt is the type of the world egypt in the sea and israel is a type of the church financial canister israel is a type of there is a spiritual issue we are not natural israelites we is and jesus will always overcome saturn jesus was born for a purpose until it is their purpose for why they were born and i'm speaking on a purpose driven life though physically there were a people bodybuilding that god had called the idea no man foreign i need to be crazy with that hallelujah amen before you become crazy nature it cannot mean anything to you i am god wanted the israelites ready to go and serve him let my people go and give again that was the purpose of god where they wanted and today [Music] individual like that the purpose of god has to be accomplished before you before you know your purpose why you are born you have not yet realized the instance of life oh god help me to be able to bring this character many people in this life they chest after wind the day i realized this message is true today god proved to me that this message is true i made up my mind you saw the lord with all my soul all my heart is you know gathering at school i was crystal [Applause] [Music] and then you die [Music] is [Music] i don't even know where she was from because they told jesus they say to themselves they come back we wish we know god is saying that he knows what type of woman that she is she was as because i and am me to the arms of jesus and here are the disciples saying we're wishing you guys our master [Applause] [Music] yes i was he would have condemned her to death this woman [Music] [Music] oh i could be dormant she's convicted there's a deliverance taking place don't touch her no one else whenever there is a service because i'm perfect [Music] hallelujah amen if you realize you have a baptist in life you cannot come to church and your mind is somewhere how long will you refuse to hammer yourself before me oh no come on that he had how many even know that moses was a married man [Music] how many knew that

facebook he's a young man that never missed church he was always in charge he said mechanism he was manning the videos i learned that it was even the one sending making some that is these things that their church was sending out quarterback and you know very professionally made he was the one making yeah where is because of how christ impacted him angery christopher and the life he lived a life of testimony of christ foreign i don't care how many years i will be when i die but i want to be remembered as someone no who impacted the lives of when we went into the plane but you have a demon johnny i thought i remember i was one time in in a house actually and uh ethiopian airlines crashed in union ethiopia it [Music] no one could even see any of them because they were all turned into because i made up my mind but as the plane was shaking i thought there was those people punished i want to anyway we could just perish right now will die teddy arrows and no one who no one even wants to think

do your negation meaning you are picking yourself up but if you obey people hallelujah hallelujah if you obey or gonda it's not going to be easy he never said it would be easy but he said i'll be with you when you are working in your life's purpose and i tell you when you are working in your life many will disagree when will mean i mean misunderstanding amen now i'll read for you a quote in the message taking sides with jesus and i think that's the thing here i know stood here and i told you that this is a vision we are going to have our church lives what's the purpose that's the question what is motivating us [Music] right brother wanga goes to street just the switch to preach even when sometimes he's very tired i try to understand why he does it is it for money grandson used to collect money no he no longer collects money on the road same time adversity did he stop narrated out you you're back i'm away buddy but we need your help with we talk twitter me thank you man send us those figures no i'm buying for you all right i don't want water did he stop preaching our buddy no need that he still goes sister wanga where is she that sister go he still goes oh it is always be competing cindy why did we do that write it twice i ask you days of the voice fellowship where is our enthusiasm where are the younger men and women is you have got to be enthused with him hallelujah amen if you are going to preach it preach it like you are in zeus [Music] amen until you feel what do you want to say amen do you want to live that word hallelujah if you are not ensued with your mercy where to send you saying there is something wrong [Music] with you you are not confused about going to church playing the piano [Music] it's a big opportunity you need to be enthused and i'm the first one [Applause] where's the broom what's the rack oh let me take this plastic so enjoyment hallelujah amen sowing in the morning sowing seeds of kindness sowing in the noon time and i do it [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] when you're live [Music] [Music] these are principles of our faith see no no no who cares about faith do what you do for the lord when you are cheerful and you watch the blessing foreign this is a better life than hitler's life this is a better life than hitler's life is a better life than muslims jesus did you take it i was used by that king's son you said if you are not enthused by that that's your examiner then something is wrong you've got just not to say or you know we've got just not to say they're truly not talking a little bit down here and finish the quote and then finish the service because like i always liked our last president mr eisenhower i had a great admiration for general eisenhower he said there is many times we picked up a shell and thrown it into the gun what we mean and later four no carries for me and he just snapped it didn't go off notice again that we said we didn't surrender if you are not successful somewhere you know oh hallelujah amen when you pray the first time keep trying to receive the holy ghost when things seemed it would not change keep trying [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i can do all things and the prophet tells you throw um try it out regem and throw another one take it down throw it in take a middle and try it again come on till one goes oh you can never there is one of them that that's a lie watch your power wait a little and one of them will go off but that's the way we got to do it just keep fighting away you cannot go hiding away heading away hallelujah amen for your business for what you are doing baby i can't make it so what i want things can't work that is as a church and as an individual as a church we have a purpose again as a church mechanism we have a purpose what is our purpose to find every last one okay don't think don't even try to think that this is a failing church antenna can you say [Music] we only batteriness will be let us be a purpose that will change uh we went and walked on the road dragon and timeline we found a young man on the road on the streets and he was going his way he was going his way myself and brother paul is an organ that paul had found our life's purpose while it was and that was to leave for the lord to preach this message this young man having his own plans talk he did [Music] meaning when i went back to ethiopia when i was ethiopia that was the second trip the third trip around your book saturday in 2014. coming in i felt in my heart why not follow up with that man i'm obsessed that maybe god will lead us and use us to convert one pastor in the pentecostals into the knowledge of the truth and then they can preach this message i'm assuming god starts builds something from nothing catholics image into occupation but all the time most of the time people love and people enjoy things which are already built into obviously listen don't be distracted no would you never know concluding here people love things which are big and i'm trying to be people like things which are beautiful i don't know it's beginning and no one is interested in going in the beginning of it praise the lord come here listen church i'm giving you my burden this morning hallelujah and this brother hologram don't know we continued with him together we would come together in our room myself and two or three people and i saw him looking at that and so it was like a dagger in my heart again i went to christ [Music] and when we finish prayer retirement we usually say if you have any questions and then from that we can begin sharing the work and then this brother organ the question and i will never forget he asked the question and say how do they pray honestly speaking i did not know how to answer that question for you how to pray i had learned how to pray nothing i'm emotional because i'm looking there and now [Music] then i told him i i i was fidgeting with my words because i did not know how to answer but i thought about jesus because they said when they asked you don't worry what you would say you know you know an apartment you know apartments apartments so um there are people living under us that brother slowly by slowly organizing the anointing of prayer eventually people would literally come from downstairs and travel once and come to us and say you were shouting for us can you please come has something that changed his mind and her name was my work he went there again i did not know he had hid it from me the reaction question he was doing so when he went there kendall and they told them you have to be ready to die for your party molino if you're not ready for [Music] and in that room which saying i saw him troubled i reached out to him what is wrong with the chief no problem everything is good then he opened up after a while you know there's something troubling and well as he was speaking i noticed that people were speaking to him [Music] that's exactly what was troubling where i have been jammed to me how you are doing this political party you showed me the card but ethiopia the bank administration of about 20 plus people have been baptized this is going now across the country you know i'm going to go in what's going on in in in no matter what's going on in our [Music] [Music] let's be laughing let us the life of christ christ there is a better life we will go for the lord [Music] here [Music] lord jesus christ living in this life [Music] that nothing counts [Music] but what we did for you okay [Music] [Music] scene those who are dying [Music] those that we

went beyond the cutting of time sisters and brothers [Music] a precious sister lady and she hugged him because there was nothing like feeling sexy and he didn't even realize who she is who are you
