[1:27:23] make it
[1:27:26] and uh also sister Ruth um on Sunday
[1:27:30] last Sunday she she was something you
[1:27:33] know U spoke to me Saturday last last
[1:27:39] week I wouldn't say something I would
[1:27:41] say the Holy
[1:27:45] Spirit and uh
[1:27:47] so like unus I felt uneasy I don't not
[1:27:50] know what was going to happen
[1:27:54] I started to go in fasting and
[1:27:56] prayer I felt something was a little off
[1:27:59] last last
[1:28:02] weekend that would do the devil had
[1:28:04] certain things he had planned
[1:28:07] on and so um and then that
[1:28:12] morning when brother Enoch here was
[1:28:14] coming with his
[1:28:17] father on on the motorcycle they had an
[1:28:21] accident and uh but you see God
[1:28:24] protected
[1:28:26] them and no bone was
[1:28:30] broken amen I believe it was because of
[1:28:34] prayer and right
[1:28:37] here uh sister Ruth had come with her
[1:28:42] children and uh she she on the stairs
[1:28:45] outside there she she had a
[1:28:50] misstep and you know she she's expecting
[1:28:54] and also had a child she was
[1:28:59] caring and if she had fallen the which
[1:29:02] was going to
[1:29:04] fall it would have been very big
[1:29:10] catastrophe uh but God was
[1:29:13] gracious and there happened to be the
[1:29:16] two deacons back there they had to be
[1:29:20] around and they tried to hold her
[1:29:24] one was holding the baby was
[1:29:26] holding and and so the leg her leg got
[1:29:29] an feet got an
[1:29:32] injury and um so uh she's under
[1:29:35] medication
[1:29:38] currently so we pray for her quick
[1:29:42] recovery amen so God was gracious if he
[1:29:44] would if it wasn't for the prayers the
[1:29:46] devil was planning
[1:29:50] was but the devil is always on the
[1:29:52] losing side
[1:29:56] amen and um so sister m is also in

[1:39:06] morning put words in my
[1:39:08] mouth take control of our
[1:39:10] minds and may we UT those things such as
[1:39:13] you want us to
[1:39:15] speak and may may it affect us in such a
[1:39:18] way that you have
[1:39:21] desired Grant it that each individ will
[1:39:24] have a
[1:39:26] portion and each person will
[1:39:28] drink from this water that you give
[1:39:32] freely in Jesus name we pray
[1:39:37] amen I'm going to speak on uh the first
[1:39:41] question this is the second
[1:39:46] part uh really I just want us to have a
[1:39:51] conversation not so much of a
[1:39:54] preaching David was longing and wanting
[1:39:56] the new birth that new
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:39:59] birth here where we read in the Book of
[1:40:02] Psalms 42 he said I am thirsty for the
[1:40:05] Living
[1:40:11] God and I want to
[1:40:13] say like I spoke in the first part each
[1:40:16] of us have a
[1:40:19] thirst and that thirst was placed within
[1:40:22] us by God
[1:40:25] and then we begin to thirst for
[1:40:27] things that do not
[1:40:30] satisfy but you will never satisfy the
[1:40:32] thirsting heart with a dead
[1:40:38] God you know we can preach dress and cod
[1:40:41] and rules of the
[1:40:45] church the do and the
[1:40:48] don't that can never
[1:40:52] satisfy the which is in your
[1:40:54] heart the only thing that will will
[1:40:57] satisfy the thir in your
[1:41:00] heart he's a living
[1:41:03] God that is why we as a church must not
[1:41:06] offer a bunch of geds and and
[1:41:12] rules
[1:41:14] regulations you know ideas
[1:41:17] Creeds but we must offer a living
[1:41:20] God that's why we must always preach and
[1:41:23] believe in a living
[1:41:26] God a God that changes
[1:41:29] lives a God that saves you from
[1:41:32] sin a God that delivers you when you are
[1:41:36] sick a God that can change you and turn
[1:41:38] your
[1:41:41] appetite and make you you know walk away
[1:41:43] from your
[1:41:46] addictions in Zechariah 13:1 he
[1:41:49] says in that day there shall be a
[1:41:51] fountain open to the house of
[1:41:55] David for sin and for
[1:41:59] unclean David spoke of the
[1:42:02] waters in the message tting for for life
[1:42:04] I read a lot out of
[1:42:07] that and then again David being a man
[1:42:09] who dealt into the
[1:42:12] woods he learned a lot about wild
[1:42:16] life and in one of the Psalms he cried
[1:42:19] as we read As the deer thirst for the
[1:42:21] waters broke
[1:42:26] so my soul thirth after thee Oh
[1:42:31] God so in the wilderness places in
[1:42:35] Israel they had wolves and
[1:42:40] dogs and these used to attack the
[1:42:44] deers because these deers were an easy
[1:42:48] pray for
[1:42:51] them and you as aie
[1:42:54] you were that dear chest by the HS of
[1:42:59] hell you know they swore the devil swore
[1:43:02] to destroy
[1:43:04] you you were
[1:43:06] running we've been running for a long
[1:43:08] time many of you are still running even
[1:43:11] now but you see you're running when you
[1:43:15] run you just run into a deep
[1:43:18] trap and you find someone trapped
[1:43:23] by
[1:43:24] addictions by you know
[1:43:27] Habits by sin and they
[1:43:30] trapped you know you they run sometimes
[1:43:33] they run to total
[1:43:36] exhaustion until the horns of of of hell
[1:43:39] until that dog or whatever would come
[1:43:41] and
[1:43:45] capture and for every
[1:43:47] sinner the horns of
[1:43:50] hell are on your Trail
[1:43:53] they are yapping at you they won't let
[1:43:56] you sleep at night
[1:43:58] sometimes I've been speaking with young
[1:44:00] people sometimes they will tell you I
[1:44:02] don't even have sleep at
[1:44:05] all do you know when you SE so far away
[1:44:08] from God you even lose
[1:44:13] sleep and many people would tell you I
[1:44:16] can't
[1:44:17] sleep some they even have to take
[1:44:19] medication in order to sleep
[1:44:23] you see why because those hounds of Hell
[1:44:25] cannot let you
[1:44:28] sleep you see the devil will take you in
[1:44:31] sin and then he will take your rest
[1:44:36] away your bed becomes
[1:44:39] hard your P so becomes so hard you
[1:44:42] cannot
[1:44:43] sleep and you don't have rest and there
[1:44:47] is no peace because you hear you know
[1:44:49] that trail coming
[1:44:53] maybe sometimes it is even something
[1:44:55] that you
[1:44:57] hear they're just sneaking up in the
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:02] shadows I've spoken to young people who
[1:45:04] have been going through these
[1:45:07] things something you feel like something
[1:45:09] ready to come and pounce on
[1:45:12] you and then you feel very
[1:45:17] vulnerable so
[1:45:19] helpless friends I want to tell you
[1:45:23] this morning I want us to enter into a
[1:45:26] hospital
[1:45:27] room let us examine Our Lives as
[1:45:32] individual outside of
[1:45:34] Christ we are
[1:45:38] vulnerable without the Holy
[1:45:41] Spirit you are
[1:45:45] vulnerable this deer would be attacked
[1:45:47] by the
[1:45:49] walles because they were uneasy pray
[1:45:54] without the Holy Ghost we also we are
[1:45:56] uneasy
[1:45:59] pray is a pray for
[1:46:02] sin and is a pray for
[1:46:05] addictions and is a pray for the attack
[1:46:07] of the devil Upon Our
[1:46:10] Lives and many of you have even promised
[1:46:13] and say Lord I will be tomorrow from
[1:46:18] today you make vows and you make
[1:46:20] promises to God
[1:46:23] and I said that can never
[1:46:25] work if you you are here and it has
[1:46:27] worked for you raise up your
[1:46:31] hand you will make vows and Promises
[1:46:34] only to break
[1:46:37] them because why your adversary the
[1:46:41] devil is after
[1:46:43] you he is there in the
[1:46:46] shadows he's over there on the next
[1:46:49] Hill he's around the next C waiting on
[1:46:51] you
[1:46:54] everywhere you look he's waiting
[1:46:56] on and in the message that I told you
[1:46:58] I'm reading from he says and that's a
[1:47:00] very good type of the
[1:47:04] devil you take a beautiful
[1:47:06] woman or a handsome young
[1:47:09] man that's a very easy
[1:47:13] prayer the very prayer for the sins of
[1:47:15] this
[1:47:17] world just to pray a little innocent boy
[1:47:19] of 16 or 17
[1:47:24] a little girl just pray to the
[1:47:28] devil to Feast
[1:47:30] on when the devil sees you he sees you
[1:47:33] as an easy
[1:47:35] pray if you are not filled with the Holy
[1:47:38] Spirit these wild dogs lay in
[1:47:43] Ambush you know the Can sin crouches at
[1:47:46] your
[1:47:49] door he said I seen it in Africa and
[1:47:51] other countries
[1:47:54] and they jump on this little
[1:47:56] deer the very first thing they do is to
[1:47:58] try to break this string behind their
[1:48:03] legs the first thing they do is to try
[1:48:06] to break that string and they they they
[1:48:08] they can't
[1:48:10] run we call it an Hunter's Voice or they
[1:48:14] call it hamstring
[1:48:25] and then if he cannot grab them
[1:48:29] there he grabs them by the
[1:48:33] throat the devil finds for the weak the
[1:48:35] devil looks for the weak
[1:48:37] spot he jacks the jugg vein
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:44] lose and it BS to
[1:48:48] death just in a moment then there is a
[1:48:51] flank in the deer
[1:48:53] and he will run and Jack his teeth into
[1:48:59] that when you know it has been done like
[1:49:03] that and maybe a vein has been removed
[1:49:06] or maybe it cannot run then it will
[1:49:09] start running for his
[1:49:13] life you know if he's a very big heavy
[1:49:17] dog and a small deer he can throw that
[1:49:20] deer on the ground from the flank
[1:49:25] he's got him in the mid
[1:49:27] Center and he swings the deer off his
[1:49:32] feet as the dog grabs it and throws
[1:49:34] himself
[1:49:37] over he throws the deer to the
[1:49:40] ground and they go right
[1:49:42] in and just tear that little fellow to
[1:49:46] Pieces I'm showing you how the devil
[1:49:48] attacks
[1:49:50] the you are that little dear
[1:49:54] the devil doesn't want to do anything to
[1:49:55] you but to
[1:49:59] destroy I want to ask you a question
[1:50:01] this
[1:50:02] morning especially to you that are still
[1:50:04] living in a life of
[1:50:06] sin what do you think that sin has to
[1:50:12] offer sin has never offered anything
[1:50:17] good sin offers broken homes
[1:50:23] sin offers ruined lives of
[1:50:27] children imagine if you as a mother or
[1:50:30] you as a father lives in
[1:50:33] sin it will offer you a broken
[1:50:36] family last time I preached on the
[1:50:39] generation of
[1:50:41] Overcomers the power of the Next
[1:50:44] Generation and I told you that the power
[1:50:46] of the next generation is in
[1:50:50] you you have the power to stop
[1:50:55] from coming to your
[1:50:57] children but whatever you do not
[1:51:01] overcome whatever you don't get
[1:51:04] over it will go through you and come to
[1:51:06] the Next
[1:51:10] Generation a life of sin will only off
[1:51:13] ruin
[1:51:16] children when you get down to the end of
[1:51:18] the
[1:51:20] road well maybe you are now or 60 or
[1:51:24] 70 you might have a great big
[1:51:27] house you might even become a great
[1:51:29] person in this
[1:51:31] life but really I want to ask you a
[1:51:34] question what does that offer
[1:51:38] you one day you are coming to the end of
[1:51:40] it
[1:51:42] all all of
[1:51:44] us one day we are going to come to the
[1:51:46] end of
[1:51:48] this and the end actually is closer than
[1:51:50] we think
[1:51:53] because there is a Rapture
[1:51:56] promised we still believe in the
[1:51:58] Rapture the Rapture is going to
[1:52:01] happen and all the wrath of God will now
[1:52:04] be powered to the world after
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:09] the he says many times the mouth of the
[1:52:12] flesh pulls
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:15] out going back to the
[1:52:19] deer and the deer is so quick
[1:52:23] and the deer can maneuver his little
[1:52:24] body so
[1:52:27] fast that sometimes he can get a away
[1:52:31] then when the dogs are rolling before
[1:52:33] before he can get
[1:52:35] up the deer can get
[1:52:39] away but if there is any Hunters
[1:52:42] here well I know there is no Hunter
[1:52:45] here if but if there is a hunter that
[1:52:49] knows that a wounded deer
[1:52:53] there is one thing a wounded deer will
[1:52:55] try to
[1:52:59] do it will only to try to find water
[1:53:02] right
[1:53:04] away and I could imagine seeing the
[1:53:06] little deer with the blood running out
[1:53:08] of
[1:53:11] him he's
[1:53:16] watching he's looking for the water
[1:53:19] BR if that deer can get the water
[1:53:24] he will
[1:53:25] live that is how the deer
[1:53:28] is there is only one thing that serves a
[1:53:32] deer a de that has been
[1:53:34] attacked a de that is shedding
[1:53:37] blood one thing that saves that
[1:53:40] deer is
[1:53:43] water if only you could get to the
[1:53:46] water sometimes when you shoot a
[1:53:49] deer it is so wounded that it will never
[1:53:52] make it to the
[1:53:55] water and then sometimes he will just
[1:53:58] run and fall into the
[1:54:01] water and too badly
[1:54:05] wounded but some of them maybe they are
[1:54:08] wounded and wound and would die from the
[1:54:12] wounds but when they run and go into
[1:54:15] that
[1:54:16] water then they begin to drink and drink
[1:54:19] and drink and drink you know that water
[1:54:22] saes
[1:54:25] that amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:54:28] I'm continuing that
[1:54:30] quot he says I've trailed them many
[1:54:33] times when they cross the
[1:54:36] creek and
[1:54:39] drink run down the creek a little
[1:54:42] piece run up on the
[1:54:45] hill they cross back and get some more
[1:54:49] water he will just keep on running as as
[1:54:52] long as he can get
[1:54:54] water but if he doesn't get
[1:54:58] water he will
[1:55:01] perish that is what David
[1:55:03] said my soul is
[1:55:07] thirsty after
[1:55:09] you like the
[1:55:12] deer I must have
[1:55:14] you I must have
[1:55:17] God or I
[1:55:21] perish David
[1:55:23] discovered 500 women could not
[1:55:29] satisfy 500 women cannot
[1:55:34] satisfy even if you said I'm going to go
[1:55:36] in a life of
[1:55:38] sin you can never have so
[1:55:41] many that you will be
[1:55:44] satisfied he had to go and take somebody
[1:55:47] else's wife even with 500 women
[1:55:54] David could make all the plages and the
[1:55:55] promises but those also could not stop
[1:55:58] him from
[1:56:01] that there is also one thing only one
[1:56:03] thing that can hold you from a life of
[1:56:07] sin it is when this thir
[1:56:11] quen comes inside of your
[1:56:14] soul hallelujah amen amen all these
[1:56:18] appetites that you
[1:56:20] have could be for Al
[1:56:23] it could be for
[1:56:24] smoking it could be for women or men
[1:56:28] addictions or that let me tell you you
[1:56:31] can even if you were in the world and
[1:56:34] you said I will do it until I'm
[1:56:36] satisfied you can never be
[1:56:39] satisfied that thir that is placed in
[1:56:41] your
[1:56:42] heart was put there by
[1:56:45] God and it is only God who can satisfy
[1:56:50] that but you see the devil to bring in
[1:56:53] all these
[1:56:54] things to try and satisfy you but you
[1:56:58] cannot be
[1:56:59] satisfied and listen to me

[1:59:35] conduct yourself how to make your hair
[1:59:38] you don't need to hear me to teach you
[1:59:39] on those
[1:59:41] things if only you can find this squ I'm
[1:59:44] speaking
[1:59:47] about Amen in the message the 6 C it
[1:59:49] says and what makes a man do wrong or he
[1:59:52] says and what makes a man do man do
[1:59:55] wrong or a woman do
[2:00:01] wrong what makes you do
[2:00:04] wrong when you don't want but you find
[2:00:06] yourself doing
[2:00:07] wrong what makes him drink and carry
[2:00:12] on is because there is something in her
[2:00:19] thirsting and something in him thirsting
[2:00:23] and they are trying to quench that Holy
[2:00:26] thirst with the things of the
[2:00:31] world when God ought to be that
[2:00:36] quencher he made you that to
[2:00:39] thirst that's the reason you thir for
[2:00:44] something God made you that
[2:00:46] way so you would turn that ho thir to
[2:00:49] him
[2:00:52] but when you try to quench that
[2:00:55] s how dare anybody do
[2:00:58] that you have no right to do
[2:01:01] that you have no right to try to quench
[2:01:03] that Holy
[2:01:05] thirst that you thirst for something and
[2:01:08] you turn it into the
[2:01:12] world you try to satisfy it with the
[2:01:15] world you cannot do that there is only
[2:01:19] one thing that will fill that up
[2:01:23] and that is
[2:01:24] God and he made you that way to
[2:01:28] thirst and to thirst so that you can be
[2:01:31] able to quench your
[2:01:35] thirst and sometimes we look at people
[2:01:38] who have done awful
[2:01:41] s and we look at them and
[2:01:45] exclaim oh the big
[2:01:48] Sinners oh even this all she's an awful
[2:01:53] sinner she's an awful
[2:01:55] sinner but if you could look at it and
[2:01:58] see it is a thirsting human
[2:02:03] being doesn't matter what you have done
[2:02:06] in your life you've done it because you
[2:02:09] were
[2:02:10] thirsting a thirsting human
[2:02:13] being if you look at them like that then
[2:02:17] you would look at them as a thirsting
[2:02:18] human being
[2:02:22] having a
[2:02:23] thirst but if you know one who can
[2:02:25] quench
[2:02:27] that you will want to give them a
[2:02:32] drink if you see someone
[2:02:37] pting and you have
[2:02:39] water you can offer them
[2:02:42] water I have some drink I want to offer

[2:17:47] once let Christ take the throne in your
[2:17:54] heart those
[2:17:56] things don't bother
[2:17:59] him it is so much
[2:18:04] greater when you receive the Holy Ghost

[2:18:55] and you will be like that
[2:18:57] Samaritan these are people the
[2:19:00] Samaritans that were placed in in places
[2:19:03] that they were taken out of their their
[2:19:07] country and be placed in captivity
[2:19:11] somewhere and when they reach that land
[2:19:14] where they
[2:19:15] are they have their own
[2:19:18] Gods but to appease the people of the
[2:19:20] land where they're

[2:38:38] us hallelujah amen I would say oh God
[2:38:44] power that
[2:38:45] water upon that seed of God in Me
[2:38:51] spring up all
[2:38:56] well your land is
[2:38:58] thirsty he said he will power
[2:39:01] water not only water but floods upon the
[2:39:06] Thirsty
[2:39:08] ground praise the name of the Lord many
[2:39:11] people will accept Jesus as
[2:39:14] their and they will accept him to pay
[2:39:17] their sin debt
[2:39:21] but they will stop
[2:39:23] there I want to look at an
[2:39:27] example let's say you have an enous
[2:39:31] debt that you could not
[2:39:34] pay you have a house but the title is in
[2:39:37] the
[2:39:38] bank and you have failed to pay the
[2:39:42] loan with interest
[2:39:46] rising and it comes to a level whereby
[2:39:48] you cannot
[2:39:52] the money lenders are beginning to
[2:39:53] threaten to take your your
[2:39:58] car because you have a lot of unpaid
[2:40:02] areas so you don't own any other
[2:40:06] assets you don't have any money to your
[2:40:09] name you can hardly make ends
[2:40:12] me everything is terrible because you
[2:40:16] have a huge
[2:40:18] de and you cannot pay that
[2:40:21] debt you see that
[2:40:23] situation you know how it is when the
[2:40:25] creditors are
[2:40:27] calling maybe some of you have been
[2:40:29] there
[2:40:31] before and they
[2:40:34] hounding you and cannot
[2:40:38] answer and even when you answer the
[2:40:41] phone you you don't know is it the
[2:40:46] maners how many have ever been in that
[2:40:48] situation
[2:40:50] don't raise up your
[2:40:54] hand is it the
[2:40:56] moneyers you are so filled with
[2:41:01] anxiety and when you are in that
[2:41:04] situation goes
[2:41:08] off because the units are
[2:41:13] finished while you are there the bank
[2:41:16] sends you a
[2:41:17] letter we are taking a possessing your
[2:41:22] house because you have failed
[2:41:24] [Music]
[2:41:27] toay pay this
[2:41:29] debt or we will take this house that's
[2:41:33] how it is with our
[2:41:35] soul the the devil is like pay this
[2:41:40] debt or will take your soul into
[2:41:43] prison we will burn it like the in the
[2:41:45] Lake of
[2:41:46] Fire we are coming after your soul
[2:41:50] you know like this man is walking
[2:41:53] working himself
[2:41:55] up walking as much as he
[2:41:58] can but he cannot pay the
[2:42:00] debt because the debt is
[2:42:02] big and
[2:42:05] finally some man comes
[2:42:08] along a
[2:42:11] billionaire
[2:42:12] Rich he comes along and pays your enm
[2:42:19] and he says I want to do something for
[2:42:21] you I want to pay off your
[2:42:24] house I'm going to pay off your car I'm
[2:42:27] going to pay all
[2:42:30] theill I'm going to pay it off today
[2:42:34] when I give you this check you are going
[2:42:36] to be debt
[2:42:39] free you know what will happen to you
[2:42:42] you would have peace you will have
[2:42:47] relas you will be so emo
[2:42:51] you will cry you will
[2:42:54] shout you will just go to everybody and
[2:42:57] tell them my debt has been
[2:43:00] paid the debt I couldn't pay was
[2:43:04] paid you would feel a weight lifted from
[2:43:07] your
[2:43:09] shoulders you would go speak skipping on
[2:43:11] the streets and telling
[2:43:15] everybody hallelujah hallelujah now
[2:43:18] whenever they call
[2:43:20] you you're not you're not afraid to take
[2:43:22] a
[2:43:25] call you are not hiding
[2:43:29] somewhere you don't expect any
[2:43:31] threatening
[2:43:33] call my dat has been
[2:43:36] paid hallelujah hallelujah amen it is
[2:43:40] all
[2:43:41] paid you can now go and have a new
[2:43:47] life but
[2:43:49] you can also
[2:43:51] go and make a new
[2:43:56] debt now listen closely even though that
[2:43:59] one that one that man paid your
[2:44:04] debts and he became your savior to save
[2:44:07] you from loss you still wouldn't have
[2:44:09] his life or his nature you still
[2:44:13] wouldn't have his
[2:44:17] nature and that's where many Believers
[2:44:21] are my debt was
[2:44:25] paid I'm free I'm free from sin I'm
[2:44:30] happy Jesus saved me and you know what
[2:44:33] they
[2:44:34] do he paid my debt and they go take
[2:44:38] other
[2:44:39] debt they come back again to the church
[2:44:42] oh God this one
[2:44:44] also it is paid it is finished
[2:44:49] he paid my
[2:44:51] debt again they go take
[2:44:53] another why you you
[2:44:57] still can make more
[2:45:00] debts because you don't have the nature
[2:45:04] of the debt
[2:45:08] pay that is what is lacking in many
[2:45:13] Believers of course you feel the weight
[2:45:16] lifted you will be so happy you will
[2:45:20] shout in the Holy Spirit you will roll
[2:45:23] on the floor you will be so
[2:45:24] happy but when you go your life your
[2:45:28] nature is the
[2:45:30] same that's a clear
[2:45:32] sign you did not actually receive the
[2:45:35] holy
[2:45:38] spirit because your nature is the
[2:45:44] same but if you want to know that your
[2:45:46] Nature has changed
[2:45:51] the nature of The Debt
[2:45:54] Pay will be in
[2:45:56] you and you cannot make any more
[2:46:01] debt Jesus said he that believeth on
[2:46:04] me out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[2:46:07] Living
[2:46:10] Water praise the name of the Lord now
[2:46:13] all your Sensations this is the message
[2:46:17] Investments brother brother B preached
[2:46:19] this in
[2:46:21] 1963 he says now all your
[2:46:23] Sensations as we Pentecostal people like
[2:46:26] to jump and
[2:46:29] Shout he said I believe that's all
[2:46:32] right we like to speak with
[2:46:35] Tong I believe that's a gift of God the
[2:46:38] devil can impersonate
[2:46:42] that you can produce that in that
[2:46:47] line so that's not a
[2:46:49] proof that you have received this Holy
[2:46:52] Spirit I'm speaking of you may speak in
[2:46:54] tongues you may shout in the Holy you
[2:46:58] may be so
[2:46:59] happy but still that can be
[2:47:05] impersonated you will find this this
[2:47:07] kind of teaching only in the
[2:47:11] message out there they think because
[2:47:16] they can
[2:47:17] shout they have the Holy Ghost
[2:47:20] because they can speak in Tong they have
[2:47:22] the Holy but yet when you come and see
[2:47:26] their
[2:47:27] life their life is
[2:47:29] rotten their life is the same their sin
[2:47:33] nature is still sitting on the throne of
[2:47:36] the
[2:47:38] heart but he says notice then it shows
[2:47:42] that something is
[2:47:44] wrong The Life of Christ isn't flowing
[2:47:47] through the church the way it sh
[2:47:51] the body the bride is not going through
[2:47:53] there like it
[2:47:56] should it is clogged up
[2:48:02] somewhere clogged up
[2:48:04] some because if you have the spirit of
[2:48:07] God your nature will
[2:48:10] change what is wrong today in many
[2:48:12] churches across the
[2:48:14] land what is clogging up the church
[2:48:18] accepting the Theology of the
[2:48:23] blood we are accepting the teachings of
[2:48:25] the
[2:48:28] word but we are not
[2:48:31] born of the
[2:48:33] spirit the blood of Jesus Christ is more
[2:48:36] than our
[2:48:40] substitute he is also our sin
[2:48:45] offering surely paid our debts
[2:48:48] but in this
[2:48:50] Covenant there is more to
[2:48:52] eat than just receiving money from the
[2:48:55] rich
[2:48:57] man receiving the life of that rich
[2:49:01] one Jesus is our Kingsman
[2:49:05] Redeemer he was so
[2:49:07] rich to pay all the debts of the whole
[2:49:12] world then take your sins and put them
[2:49:15] in the sea of forgetfulness
[2:49:17] [Music]
[2:49:19] and make you a Son of
[2:49:21] God where the little life of Jesus
[2:49:25] Christ returns back
[2:49:27] again upon your life and changes your
[2:49:32] nature not a patched up
[2:49:35] life not turning a new
[2:49:38] Leaf when the new year begins you say
[2:49:41] I'm going to
[2:49:43] begin you change your sim card you
[2:49:46] change your friends you change your rece
[2:49:49] and then in the next two weeks you are
[2:49:52] rotten
[2:49:55] again why because you simply turned a
[2:50:01] new you never
[2:50:04] died the only way for you to be born
[2:50:08] again is to die fast if you still love
[2:50:12] the world and the things of the world
[2:50:15] there is no
[2:50:16] evidence that the life of God
[2:50:20] when he comes all the things are
[2:50:24] what passed away and behold the Bible
[2:50:27] says all things are
[2:50:30] new if you even ever go in the
[2:50:33] Rapture you are going to have that same
[2:50:36] Spirit which was in Jesus
[2:50:38] Christ you have going to have the same
[2:50:41] life that he had the only way you will
[2:50:44] ever go in the
[2:50:46] Rapture is to become born again
[2:50:50] of the Holy
[2:50:52] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah many
[2:50:55] Believers come having good
[2:50:59] intentions saying I'm going to go all
[2:51:01] the
[2:51:02] way but you go as far as accepting the
[2:51:07] pardon and and forgiveness of your sin
[2:51:13] debt but you don't go ahead to receive
[2:51:15] the divine
[2:51:18] that is why sister
[2:51:20] brother you find it very
[2:51:22] hard to stay out of
[2:51:25] debt that's why you continually have to
[2:51:27] come back again again to the
[2:51:31] altar because you have had somebody pay
[2:51:33] your
[2:51:34] debt and yes you feel
[2:51:37] better and you can even sleep very well
[2:51:39] at that night and you even have a good
[2:51:43] hope but that real
[2:51:46] faith is not there that real faith
[2:51:50] says if there is one going in the
[2:51:53] Rapture it is me
[2:51:56] going how many here have that
[2:51:59] Faith don't just raise up your hand now
[2:52:02] that you can surely say if there is one
[2:52:05] going in this church and
[2:52:07] the if Jesus was to come
[2:52:10] now and he's taking one I'm that
[2:52:15] one I can't speak for anyone else
[2:52:19] but I
[2:52:20] know friends I met God I
[2:52:28] know and that should be
[2:52:31] everyone's
[2:52:35] confession his life came into
[2:52:38] me and I'm filled with the Holy
[2:52:42] Spirit and out of me is coming
[2:52:47] rivers of Living Water that should be
[2:52:50] your
[2:52:53] testimony but people go through the
[2:52:57] church and they don't they fear to go to
[2:53:01] hell but you see you are still
[2:53:06] attracted to that little
[2:53:09] girl to that little
[2:53:13] boy who has beautiful
[2:53:16] hair and these days they like to make a
[2:53:18] bit
[2:53:22] wavy and you look at that and you're
[2:53:24] attracted to
[2:53:26] that and every little girl you see
[2:53:29] brother you are still
[2:53:32] lustful towards her you pulled that way
[2:53:35] you pulled this
[2:53:36] way then the next day you are very busy
[2:53:39] watching fil
[2:53:42] and if you love the things of the
[2:53:45] world the love of God is Not In You
[2:53:49] in you know friends this has I said I
[2:53:52] wanted us to have a
[2:53:55] conversation this is the place where you
[2:53:57] need to
[2:54:00] arrive and say I am
[2:54:03] sure I have the spirit of God in my
[2:54:06] heart and if he was to come now I'm
[2:54:09] going in the
[2:54:13] RT that's where you have to be brother
[2:54:18] but if you still love the
[2:54:20] world the things of the world the love
[2:54:23] of God is
[2:54:25] not in order to get that love of
[2:54:30] God into your
[2:54:32] heart you have to
[2:54:36] die where to the place where that love
[2:54:39] for cigarettes will
[2:54:42] die where that love for those filthy
[2:54:45] movies will die
[2:54:49] and sometimes we debate on what is
[2:54:51] filthy and what is not
[2:54:54] filthy and many of you have asked me
[2:54:57] Pastor is it wrong to watch
[2:55:00] movies and my answer is always
[2:55:03] no and so then we will see what is out
[2:55:07] of
[2:55:08] you is there a river out of
[2:55:11] you because if there is that River of
[2:55:14] living water coming out of
[2:55:17] you there are certain movies you will
[2:55:19] never put your eyes
[2:55:22] on whether they look harmless or
[2:55:27] not you're going to have a different
[2:55:31] appetite you see it's it's going to be
[2:55:34] more than Pastor can I do this or can I
[2:55:36] not do
[2:55:38] that is it okay is it okay for me to do
[2:55:41] my hair this
[2:55:43] way can I do that or can I not do
[2:55:46] that you see you going to go beyond
[2:55:50] that he that has received the spirit of
[2:55:53] God does not live under the
[2:55:56] law you are actually beyond the
[2:55:59] law you are no longer being ruled by dos
[2:56:02] and
[2:56:04] don'ts the sin has
[2:56:07] died praise the name of the
[2:56:11] Lord I'm so
[2:56:13] thankful that about 18 years ago in my
[2:56:16] life
[2:56:20] you know I met this th
[2:56:22] quencher I had a lot of
[2:56:25] th in my life if I begin listing them
[2:56:28] right now I may not finish right now but
[2:56:32] when I met
[2:56:33] that he quenched my
[2:56:39] thought nothing else is
[2:56:42] desirable you give me a
[2:56:46] beer I'll just laugh at
[2:56:49] I don't have the
[2:56:52] appetite say oh God I love
[2:56:57] the
[2:56:59] I I don't have
[2:57:01] a he
[2:57:05] died oh you've been married 11
[2:57:09] years you are old you have no feelings
[2:57:12] for other
[2:57:13] women don't be deceived it's just that I
[2:57:17] died
[2:57:18] [Music]
[2:57:20] I died and brother you have to
[2:57:23] die sister you have to die to that
[2:57:28] desire of having sexy
[2:57:33] clothes to the extent that we will come
[2:57:35] and preach about clothes in the
[2:57:38] church we should never preach on clothes
[2:57:41] in the
[2:57:43] church you if everybody in the church
[2:57:45] has made that
[2:57:48] that will be a thing we don't even talk
[2:57:52] about but where you find in the church
[2:57:55] every service
[2:57:56] every the preacher is talking about your
[2:57:59] clothes your D your it shows there are
[2:58:04] many who have not even received the Holy
[2:58:08] Ghost and there are many who claim I
[2:58:10] have the Holy Ghost and they dress like
[2:58:13] Bel
[2:58:15] Jezebel and you have the Holy Ghost that
[2:58:18] Holy Spirit will throw away
[2:58:22] makeup will throw away all these
[2:58:24] trousers of
[2:58:26] women there is nothing like trousers of
[2:58:29] women no nothing like that in the Bible
[2:58:32] there's only trousers for
[2:58:36] men and when I say that I mean not only
[2:58:39] in
[2:58:41] church
[2:58:43] everywhere in your bedroom on the road
[2:58:47] at work
[2:58:48] anywhere a Believer is a
[2:58:52] Believer the holy spirit fs on the same
[2:58:56] same the Holy Spirit cannot feed on them
[2:58:58] things of the
[2:59:01] world those appetites will
[2:59:04] die some of these apps that you are
[2:59:08] own when you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:59:11] theti will
[2:59:13] die because the food which is there is
[2:59:16] no longer yours
[2:59:19] when you receive the Holy Ghost we shall
[2:59:21] have more people on Wednesday in the
[2:59:24] church because you are hungry for the
[2:59:27] world you are hungry for the for
[2:59:30] God you can hardly stay at
[2:59:33] home and say I will
[2:59:35] stream you just have the anger and The
[2:59:39] Thirst like that deer for the things of
[2:59:43] God and the word of God and the songs of
[2:59:45] Z
[2:59:48] before you receive the holy the Holy
[2:59:51] Ghost you are believing eternal
[2:59:56] life but you don't have eternal life
[2:59:59] until you receive the Holy
[3:00:01] Ghost hey do you know that did you know
[3:00:05] that until you receive the Holy
[3:00:08] Ghost you don't have etal
[3:00:11] life why only those who have eternal
[3:00:16] life are going the
[3:00:18] Rapture so if we say anybody who
[3:00:22] believes that Jesus died for
[3:00:25] them has received eternal
[3:00:27] life without receiving the Holy Ghost it
[3:00:31] means everybody who is called a
[3:00:33] Christian will go
[3:00:36] into but the foolish virgin
[3:00:39] stayed why because they
[3:00:42] believed in Jesus but they did not
[3:00:46] receive the Holy Spirit
[3:00:49] and so they could not make it to the
[3:00:51] Rapture so if you are
[3:00:53] wise receive the Holy
[3:00:58] Spirit you have to have the thirst for
[3:01:03] it the devil knows the church is
[3:01:06] pregnant and so he comes along to try to
[3:01:09] give a a hard Breeze to the
[3:01:14] church to breathe that church that wants
[3:01:17] to kill the child
[3:01:20] there are some of you now that are ready
[3:01:23] to receive the Holy
[3:01:24] Ghost I know you are in needing
[3:01:28] something something is missing
[3:01:31] somewhere but you are consoling
[3:01:34] yourself saying I'm all
[3:01:36] right you know I believe the message but
[3:01:39] I believe it you know even my
[3:01:43] mothers I've been in church for some
[3:01:46] years you know there is something that
[3:01:49] is lacking in your
[3:01:51] life if you know it you know
[3:01:53] it there is something lacking in your
[3:01:59] life something has to
[3:02:02] happen until you you know it doesn't
[3:02:06] matter who is
[3:02:07] there you shout
[3:02:09] out Glory
[3:02:12] Hallelujah that kind of joy that is
[3:02:14] bubbling from the
[3:02:16] soul and then you let go of the
[3:02:20] world and then you let go of
[3:02:23] sin without anybody seeing you or
[3:02:26] watching you or foring
[3:02:30] you until you become crazy to the
[3:02:34] world until you get a brand new
[3:02:37] mind until your thinking is even
[3:02:41] changed that is what needs to happen
[3:02:44] brother
[3:02:45] sisters even your behavior will
[3:02:49] change it changes your
[3:02:52] dress it changes your
[3:02:54] attitude it changes everything about you
[3:02:58] because the life of the one who paid
[3:03:00] your
[3:03:03] debt comes into your
[3:03:06] life and and and and and you will never
[3:03:10] make another date
[3:03:12] again he says that out of his Bell shall
[3:03:16] flow rivers of living
[3:03:21] and this is a good example here that I
[3:03:23] want to give
[3:03:24] you I wish we had a pipe here do we have
[3:03:27] a pipe anywhere here
[3:03:30] brother a
[3:03:33] pipe you see the prophet L did to stop
[3:03:36] stopped a
[3:03:42] pipe a stopped up a pipe that is
[3:03:46] B you know the the holy spirit is
[3:03:50] here he is trying to force
[3:03:55] himself he's pushing
[3:03:58] down he's appearing in this
[3:04:01] age even here in the recent weeks in the
[3:04:04] church we have
[3:04:05] seen he has given Saints and wonders
[3:04:09] he's pushing and pushing and
[3:04:11] pushing but you have got something that
[3:04:13] has stopped up the
[3:04:16] floor rivers of Living
[3:04:20] Waters is here of their
[3:04:24] potentially Among Us it's
[3:04:27] there it is not flowing In Your
[3:04:31] Vessel but it is
[3:04:34] here maybe it is stopped up because you
[3:04:37] are content with just a substitute that
[3:04:39] you
[3:04:46] have you are just ified with just sins
[3:04:52] forgiven and because the weight of sin
[3:04:54] is
[3:04:56] gone knowing that you are not going to
[3:05:00] hell I don't know what is in your
[3:05:02] life but you know you know the flow is
[3:05:07] not
[3:05:10] there that flow of the holy
[3:05:13] spirit is not there you know it that
[3:05:18] cannot be told to you you
[3:05:20] know and if it there you also
[3:05:25] know something has stopped it
[3:05:28] up and it is supposed to
[3:05:31] flow it is kind of like working on a
[3:05:33] pipe and you know the water is
[3:05:37] there is there a pipe
[3:05:40] here and you know the water is
[3:05:43] there and and and you know you know the
[3:05:46] pressure is there
[3:05:49] something has got it stopped
[3:05:52] up you run this little wire and you know
[3:05:55] then brother martin knows these things
[3:05:57] because it's a
[3:05:59] plumber and then you get a
[3:06:02] wire and then you you you pierce it
[3:06:05] through and then you you begin to Zig
[3:06:08] Zig Zig
[3:06:09] Z and push it
[3:06:12] there until you can feel that thing
[3:06:14] which is blocking the water
[3:06:19] I can get down to this far and I can't
[3:06:22] get any
[3:06:25] further push a little
[3:06:28] more and it just bends
[3:06:31] back some unbelief or sin has got the
[3:06:34] PIP
[3:06:36] sto now let me tell you let me stop here
[3:06:39] a moment I tell
[3:06:42] you preachers can come
[3:06:44] here or I can come your pastor any other
[3:06:48] brother preach you
[3:06:50] happy but when you are on your way to
[3:06:54] miss the
[3:06:57] Rapture what
[3:07:00] profit what profit you gain out of that
[3:07:05] you can sit in the Church of a
[3:07:07] Believer and at the end of it
[3:07:09] all you miss the
[3:07:12] Rapture the Rapture is going to
[3:07:15] happen God has sent us the the last day
[3:07:21] Prophet with a message that is preparing
[3:07:25] us we seeing that it's the old time Holy
[3:07:29] Spirit and the devil won't go
[3:07:31] near we not talking about the
[3:07:34] knowledge we talking about the life of
[3:07:37] [Applause]
[3:07:39] it when you receive that Holy
[3:07:42] Spirit it quen someh quenches all your
[3:07:45] thirst
[3:07:48] and you can never thirst for the things
[3:07:50] again but what happens is we have a lot
[3:07:53] of things that is
[3:07:55] blocking that
[3:07:57] River from flowing in our
[3:08:01] life some of you is
[3:08:03] anger some unbelief some kind of sin
[3:08:06] that doing in your life but you better
[3:08:09] get to where you don't care what people
[3:08:13] think you have got to want it more than
[3:08:16] anything else
[3:08:19] you have to put off anything
[3:08:22] else some of you maybe maybe when I
[3:08:24] finish
[3:08:26] campus I will concentrate and seek for
[3:08:30] it or when I finish school or when
[3:08:33] I when I marry finish marriage how about
[3:08:38] if you do it right
[3:08:41] now you better put it ahead of
[3:08:45] everything it has got to become first in
[3:08:48] your
[3:08:50] life I must have
[3:08:53] this or
[3:08:56] perish I'm thirsty you have got to get
[3:08:59] down to where it means more than
[3:09:01] anything
[3:09:04] to I have got to get that
[3:09:07] Flor you have heard the pastor talking
[3:09:10] about that
[3:09:11] River I want that flow to flow through
[3:09:14] me I want that life to flow through me
[3:09:18] you know if it means you know what did
[3:09:20] Peter do when he went in the upper room
[3:09:24] that's what he was doing there was
[3:09:26] something
[3:09:27] blocking you know Peter had Peter was a
[3:09:31] deceiver he was a
[3:09:33] denier you know he denied Jesus he was
[3:09:36] not he was a liar he said I'll be with
[3:09:39] you even if for so these things were
[3:09:42] there to sin sing his life blocking his
[3:09:47] life
[3:09:48] from that flow but make no mistake Peter
[3:09:51] was a
[3:09:52] preacher Peter was even casting
[3:09:55] demons did you know that but that flow
[3:09:59] was not
[3:10:00] there Peter had a calling on
[3:10:04] his but that flow was not there when it
[3:10:07] comes to the test the
[3:10:11] Temptation he that flow was not there
[3:10:14] there was nothing bubbling up in him the
[3:10:17] only thing he would run to was
[3:10:20] Canal picked up a knife said I'm ready
[3:10:24] who is going to ATT my
[3:10:27] master killed somebody Peter was so full
[3:10:30] of
[3:10:31] canal maybe many of you are still full
[3:10:34] of
[3:10:35] canal but I'm telling you I would be a
[3:10:39] liar if I don't tell you this
[3:10:41] things but if I tell it to you brothers
[3:10:44] and sisters then it is your
[3:10:46] responsibility
[3:10:48] to take something and begin
[3:10:51] push push
[3:10:53] out when Peter went into the upper
[3:10:57] room what do you think he went to do he
[3:11:01] went to
[3:11:02] push he was pushing out that deception
[3:11:05] he was pushing out that busting he was
[3:11:08] pushing out that Li he was pushing out
[3:11:11] all those kind of
[3:11:12] things and as he push and he push and he
[3:11:15] pushed
[3:11:17] woo hallelujah hallelujah that River
[3:11:20] began
[3:11:23] flowing it came with a lot of
[3:11:25] pressure you know that water which has
[3:11:28] been
[3:11:29] cloged and
[3:11:31] then then the clogging comes
[3:11:34] out it comes so much gashing
[3:11:39] pressure it began coming out and they
[3:11:43] started talking in tongues and and then
[3:11:46] the people came down
[3:11:48] he said hey what's happening here you
[3:11:50] said no you people you drunk Peter who
[3:11:53] was
[3:11:55] fearful he was no longer
[3:11:59] fearful he had found the thir
[3:12:02] question at first he had fear he could
[3:12:05] not stand for Jesus maybe some of you
[3:12:08] have
[3:12:09] friends and you can't stand for
[3:12:12] the before your
[3:12:15] friends he's coming right down to your
[3:12:18] address I want to ask you as
[3:12:22] individuals how many
[3:12:24] here have their
[3:12:26] friends and your friends know what you
[3:12:29] believe you don't need to raise up your
[3:12:31] hand just think about
[3:12:35] it all your friends
[3:12:38] know from your left and to your right
[3:12:41] they all know what you stand
[3:12:43] for they all know that God sent a
[3:12:45] prophet in your generation
[3:12:47] they all know that you believe in
[3:12:49] Jesus God they all know that you believe
[3:12:52] in water baptism in the name of our Lord
[3:12:55] Jesus Christ they all know you going to
[3:12:57] the
[3:12:58] rupture I can tell you for sure if they
[3:13:01] don't know I'm sure you will be where
[3:13:03] they will be after during the
[3:13:08] Rapture you will be where they will
[3:13:11] be because if they don't know it is just
[3:13:16] evident you don't
[3:13:18] know you know but you have not
[3:13:21] experienced but what we are talking
[3:13:23] about we must experience
[3:13:26] it we must experience it and Peter when
[3:13:30] he reached there at first he was fearful
[3:13:33] when the girl came to him you have been
[3:13:36] with them no no no I don't
[3:13:39] know but at that moment right there when
[3:13:44] when the Holy Ghost came down Peter
[3:13:48] changed what do you think happened think
[3:13:51] about
[3:13:53] it from denying before a little
[3:13:59] girl to speaking before a crowd of
[3:14:05] 3,000 some of you young men you can't

[3:14:50] would they think because they know what

[3:14:54] a Bible they would say even you have a
[3:14:56] Bible are you a

[3:19:02] Christian and you don't have a

[3:19:24] Bible and we will know whether you read
[3:19:26] your Bible or

[3:19:32] it very
[3:19:33] clear then know you never read your

[3:20:45] what it means to love
[3:20:49] God I surely love God with all my
[3:20:52] heart but when you say it it is through
[3:20:56] that
[3:20:57] floor that is bubbling up when we sing
[3:21:01] songs you can see people who have that
[3:21:04] FL they're singing they're flowing in
[3:21:07] the Flor they have the life but when you
[3:21:10] don't have the
[3:21:12] floor you are in the church but you feel
[3:21:15] like as if you

[3:22:00] dry brother is that how you want it to
[3:22:06] be is that how you want it to
[3:22:08] be is that how you want to
[3:22:13] leave do you know the holy spirit is
[3:22:16] real
[3:22:18] and he feels people who desire
[3:22:24] you and when it comes upon you there
[3:22:28] will be a
[3:22:31] bubble he will be
[3:22:35] everywhere when you begin
[3:22:38] worshiping you don't even
[3:22:40] know where the tears
[3:22:45] come you don't even know you just feel
[3:22:49] something bubbling inside of
[3:22:52] you if you have what I'm talking about
[3:22:57] you know what I'm talking
[3:22:58] about but if you do not have what I'm
[3:23:01] talking about you're missing out a great
[3:23:06] deal when you are in
[3:23:09] Temptation that moments when you
[3:23:12] alone and you are tempted
[3:23:17] that
[3:23:17] flow will begin
[3:23:20] bubbling bubbling up bubbling up and you
[3:23:24] will see yourself going through that
[3:23:29] Temptation because it says lead us not
[3:23:31] into
[3:23:32] temptation Deliver Us from
[3:23:35] Evil who does that that one in
[3:23:39] you he that is in you is greater than
[3:23:43] your

[3:24:52] Ghost that's what it will make you
[3:24:56] mothers you sisters before you are even

[3:25:12] generation of

[3:25:16] generation that fears the word of God
[3:25:20] that loves the word of God a generation
[3:25:23] that has the

[3:26:18] who have this
[3:26:23] flow hallelujah amen you talk about John
[3:26:28] wisley talk about all this he was his
[3:26:32] mother

[3:26:43] floor if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[3:26:46] you cannot know how to
[3:26:49] pray but if you have the flow you begin
[3:26:53] praying you begin praying and it's like
[3:26:55] you put on that
[3:26:57] strong you begin bubbling
[3:26:59] up within you it's like you are swimming
[3:27:03] in
[3:27:04] water you enjoy the prayer but when you
[3:27:08] pray without the Holy

[3:29:10] giving people
[3:29:15] this praise the name of the
[3:29:17] Lord I'm just wanting to read what I
[3:29:19] read
[3:29:21] again he says he that believeth on
[3:29:26] me out of his
[3:29:30] belly out of his
[3:29:32] belly shall flow
[3:29:35] rivers of Living
[3:29:39] Water Jesus spoke to this woman and told
[3:29:43] her you remember we talked about it last
[3:29:45] time
[3:29:46] how she was
[3:29:48] thirsting having five men and she was
[3:29:51] not yet
[3:29:53] satisfied and the sixth one and Jesus
[3:29:57] said if you knew who I was the water I
[3:30:01] give
[3:30:02] you if I give it to you you will never
[3:30:05] thir
[3:30:09] again I have a question for
[3:30:11] you did this woman drink
[3:30:16] did she drink of that
[3:30:18] water did Jesus feed her person
[3:30:23] physically It Is by
[3:30:26] What It Is by
[3:30:29] faith Jesus was talking over a
[3:30:32] well of water and the water he
[3:30:36] had the woman started by
[3:30:40] laughing what are you going to get the
[3:30:44] water the woman did not
[3:30:47] Jesus was talking of a
[3:30:51] spiritual the world I'm speaking
[3:30:54] about not a physical well
[3:30:59] not Jesus was standing with that
[3:31:02] woman that well was
[3:31:06] there the woman was not seeing it by
[3:31:10] eyes but as Jesus was having that
[3:31:13] conversation with
[3:31:16] her eyes
[3:31:18] open she said H give me to
[3:31:22] drink give me to drink of this water
[3:31:25] said the water I give you if you drink
[3:31:28] it you will never thirst again and the
[3:31:32] the moment she said give me to
[3:31:34] drink the moment she said give me to
[3:31:37] drink Jesus said go bring me your
[3:31:42] husband now I'm trying to finish here
[3:31:46] why did Jesus go to
[3:31:48] that at that
[3:31:51] moment because you cannot
[3:31:56] drink without
[3:32:00] dying to your to the old
[3:32:02] [Music]
[3:32:05] you kill all the
[3:32:07] past remove all the sinful life remove
[3:32:11] all the unbelief remove all the doubts
[3:32:16] it all
[3:32:19] die and the woman had to
[3:32:22] confess with her own mouth and she said
[3:32:25] to Jesus I have no husband Jesus said
[3:32:29] you've said it you've been living with
[3:32:31] fire and the one you are living now is
[3:32:35] also not your husband she said
[3:32:38] yes what was that Jesus revealed the
[3:32:43] secrets of her life this is what was
[3:32:46] going on in the service
[3:32:49] to if anything was spoken
[3:32:52] about that you noise in your life Jesus
[3:32:55] was doing the same
[3:32:57] thing having a conversation with
[3:33:01] you is this how your life is see this is
[3:33:04] how you are see this is how you are see
[3:33:07] this how but I have a well
[3:33:11] of if I give it to you today you will
[3:33:14] never thirst again
[3:33:16] and the woman received the
[3:33:18] Revelation and the water pot she
[3:33:22] had she just threw it
[3:33:25] down and she took off and ran to the
[3:33:29] city say to the people come see a
