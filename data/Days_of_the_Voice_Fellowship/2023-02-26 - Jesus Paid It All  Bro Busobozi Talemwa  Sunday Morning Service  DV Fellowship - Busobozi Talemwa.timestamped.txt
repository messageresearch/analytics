[2:11] [Music]
[2:16] [Applause]
[2:18] [Music]
[2:25] thank you
[2:27] in the name of the Lord touch your
[2:28] neighbor and tell them God bless you
[2:31] [Music]
[2:33] tell them you're welcome in the house of
[2:35] the Lord
[2:35] [Music]
[2:37] amen how many are happy to be in the
[2:39] house of the Lord this morning
[2:41] coming to me why don't you give the
[2:43] other another clap on the shout of
[2:45] praise
[2:46] [Music]
[3:03] I'm so happy to be in the house of Lord
[3:05] this morning
[3:06] the Lord has done great things
[3:11] in our life
[3:12] [Music]
[3:18] you see I have prepared to sing these
[3:20] songs this morning
[3:22] [Music]
[3:24] that I have I have their lyrics printed
[3:28] on these papers
[3:28] [Music]
[3:32] we sing many songs here in this church
[3:37] some of which we are written by people
[3:39] we don't know
[3:42] but as long as it was inspired by our
[3:44] God then they are our songs
[3:49] how many believe that
[3:51] someone could have been Anglican
[3:54] it could have been respiratorian
[3:58] and then they were inspired to write
[4:00] those songs
[4:02] and then we sing them because of the
[4:03] spirit behind them
[4:06] so now this uh these ones that I was
[4:10] like I felt inspiration to sing
[4:14] were written by a Ugandan singer
[4:21] [Music]
[4:22] and the first time I had them it really
[4:26] really blessed my heart
[4:30] but this morning I'm speaking on Jesus
[4:32] Paid It All
[4:36] and so I just remembered these songs and
[4:38] when brother Peter came here yesterday
[4:40] [Music]
[4:43] he started singing the same songs
[4:47] without even knowing that I was planning
[4:49] to sing them today
[4:52] and so I I I kind of felt maybe that was
[4:56] a confirmation that God wanted us to
[4:57] sing them
[4:59] so we'll sing them to In Worship
[5:02] and I just want you to be a part of the
[5:06] worship
[5:09] for maybe just a few moments before we
[5:12] go into the world
[5:15] and we're happy to see brother Peter and
[5:17] his family this morning
[5:20] amen God bless you
[5:24] Hallelujah
[5:25] Hallelujah
[5:27] Hallelujah
[5:30] amen and we we see we have we have more
[5:33] instruments this morning
[5:35] [Music]
[5:40] you know
[5:41] on Friday
[5:45] let me just give this short testimony
[5:46] before we go to the worship
[5:50] on Friday
[5:52] I was seated in the back seat the back
[5:54] very plastic
[5:58] and
[6:01] Brother Martin was up here on the pulpit
[6:06] and you see and then he was leading us
[6:09] in prayer
[6:12] so I was just connecting with the Holy
[6:13] Spirit and in prayer
[6:17] and
[6:19] foreign
[6:20] at that moment while in prayer
[6:24] the Holy Spirit ministered to me
[6:28] and he spoke these words
[6:32] he says
[6:35] because I had already spoken with
[6:37] brother Shem
[6:39] we had been speaking he has been he had
[6:41] been speaking to me
[6:44] and it has been a burden he was telling
[6:47] me you see we need we need the the drums
[6:50] we need the best guitar we need
[6:52] [Music]
[6:55] and I didn't even want to think about it
[6:58] because it was a lot of money
[7:01] so I always would tell brother Hashem
[7:03] we've not yet reached there we don't
[7:04] need to over stretch we we don't need to
[7:07] strain the church
[7:08] [Music]
[7:10] the Lord will give the grace when we are
[7:13] ready for it
[7:14] [Music]
[7:16] but at that moment the Holy Spirit
[7:17] ministered to me and said
[7:21] buy the drums tomorrow
[7:25] said what I don't have the money
[7:28] I have a lot of debts
[7:30] buy the drums tomorrow
[7:34] it just came and I was like what
[7:38] and I I you know continue to bring for a
[7:42] moment and then I I went out
[7:46] and then I picked my phone
[7:49] and called the gentleman that sells
[7:52] these machines to us
[7:55] and I asked him
[7:58] how much
[8:00] are the drums
[8:01] [Music]
[8:04] I was just asking oh an open question
[8:07] he told me 3.5 million
[8:11] and how about that basic guitar
[8:14] you told me seven hundred thousand
[8:17] and then and then I know he was also
[8:19] demanding me six hundred thousand for
[8:22] the microphones
[8:25] that's 4.1 million
[8:28] so
[8:30] ah
[8:32] said how am I going to do this
[8:34] but one thing that I know is that God
[8:36] does not speak lies
[8:40] it was the voice of the Holy Spirit he
[8:42] had to make a way
[8:45] foreign so I told this man I told him
[8:49] can you bring the drums tomorrow
[8:54] and he said yes
[8:56] Pastor if you have the money I'll bring
[8:58] them
[9:01] and I said bring them
[9:03] I said he said do you have the money
[9:06] I said bring them in house
[9:08] leave the rest to me just bring the
[9:11] drums
[9:14] Saturday morning
[9:17] God made a miracle
[9:20] I had enough money
[9:24] to pay the man
[9:26] and I remained with the debt of 1
[9:28] million out of 4.1 million
[9:35] and the man brought the drums here
[9:39] by the time I gave the instruction
[9:42] I didn't have an idea on how I would pay
[9:46] by the time the drums reached here I had
[9:50] the funds in my hands
[9:52] do you believe in a God who does
[9:54] miracles
[9:56] so how many years have financial needs
[9:58] [Music]
[10:00] God is going to do a miracle for you
[10:07] do we just believe the word this is part
[10:09] of the word
[10:12] how many believe that
[10:13] so God will do miracles for you
[10:17] amen and if there is a somebody who
[10:19] wants to take that blessing of the
[10:21] remaining one million
[10:25] to pay up the debt
[10:28] you can begin your Miracle by paying
[10:30] that and then God will also open doors
[10:32] for you
[10:34] Hallelujah we serve a god of Miracles
[10:38] we serve a miracle working God

[38:14] I didn't hear nobody reading Selena
[38:16] Gomez I wanted to read it

[38:23] now no condemnation to them which are in
[38:27] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[38:31] flesh but after the spirit
[38:34] did you hear that maturity
[38:37] for the law of the spirit of life in
[38:40] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[38:41] love sin and death for what the law
[38:44] could not do in that it was weak through
[38:46] the flesh God sending his own son in the
[38:49] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[38:52] condemned sin in the flesh
[38:55] that the righteousness of the law might
[38:58] be fulfilled in us who work not after
[39:01] the flesh but after the spirit
[39:04] is foreign
[39:34] [Music]
[39:51] foreign
[40:18] [Music]
[40:34] brother
[40:37] brother I can see you but your seat is
[40:39] right here you missed yourself
[40:47] God bless you Brothers
[40:50] amen I love people who pulled on the
[40:53] water to be close to me so I can be able
[40:54] to preach my heart
[41:01] I'm happy to see you God bless
[41:04] God bless you all I'm happy to see
[41:06] everyone my name is
[41:08] visiting with us you're welcome
[41:11] and I want to give this time now to the
[41:15] world
[41:16] and see what the Holy Spirit has for us
[41:20] so that we can be prepared for the
[41:23] service I I don't know my sound I think
[41:26] you need to give me more sound up here
[41:29] there's a bit of a rebounding so you
[41:32] might need to work on that as well
[41:35] uh where's brother Shem
[41:38] you're always on here and things are
[41:40] always fine so why don't you come and
[41:42] work together with the brother and make
[41:43] sure that everything is working
[41:44] perfectly
[41:45] so this morning I want to speak on Jesus
[41:48] Paid It All
[41:52] [Music]
[41:53] right
[41:54] Jesus Paid It All yes
[41:57] I'd like you to lean on to your neighbor
[41:59] and tell them Jesus Paid him
[42:05] Jesus Paid It all my sister
[42:11] do we believe that
[42:13] there is therefore now no condemnation
[42:16] to them which are in Christ Jesus Christ
[42:27] is to judge
[42:31] is to sentence
[42:36] is to
[42:38] sentence a guilty person
[42:45] and you condemn them
[42:48] when you were dead to death
[42:50] or you condemn them to something
[42:54] and so this morning I'd like us to speak
[42:57] on that
[43:00] for a few days a few days ago I was away
[43:05] you and you know during that that time
[43:08] you know the Holy Spirit you know
[43:09] brought this thought to me
[43:13] and I was thinking about things and
[43:15] speaking uh to myself about things
[43:21] and I thought Jesus Paid It All
[43:25] ah praise the name of the Lord and
[43:29] really I'm not going to continue until
[43:30] you Brothers make the sound you remove
[43:31] that rebounding because we can't preach
[43:35] in the brother's microphone mine is fine
[43:38] I think amen
[43:40] I hope all of you can hear that
[43:43] needs to be removed so that we can we
[43:46] can have a good atmosphere for I mean
[43:51] foreign
[44:19] because the law
[44:21] has its part that it plays
[44:25] and
[44:28] and it is the law there's a whole
[44:30] process
[44:30] [Music]
[44:32] it's called like a legal process
[44:37] of Prosecuting of all the prosecution of
[44:41] an offender
[44:46] you know we have we have different types
[44:49] of laws
[44:52] but here in Uganda we use the common law
[44:58] and so I'll give you a little bit of a
[45:02] preamble of the common law and how it
[45:04] works
[45:08] I am not a lawyer see
[45:14] but this is common knowledge
[45:17] and I would like you to follow through
[45:19] first of all with this because if you we
[45:21] get this Foundation correctly this
[45:23] Preamble of the summer then we'll be
[45:24] able to understand the whole summer
[45:26] [Music]
[45:31] for the first few moments we all are
[45:34] going to be lawyers in making
[45:39] let us have a low class for a few
[45:42] moments
[45:43] if someone will ask you have you ever
[45:46] been have you ever been in law class you
[45:47] tell them yes
[45:51] at days of the voice
[45:56] so what is the legal process of
[45:59] prosecution of an offender
[46:01] [Music]
[46:06] the first is to investigate on the crime
[46:13] [Music]
[46:16] and the purpose of a criminal
[46:18] investigation is to gather evidence
[46:21] [Music]
[46:25] to identify a suspect and to get a
[46:29] support to arrest them
[46:31] [Music]
[46:39] or someone should not arrest you before
[46:42] they have made an investigation on you
[46:46] [Music]
[46:49] an investigation must be made
[46:52] and after it has been concluded
[47:01] enough information to identify you as a
[47:04] suspect
[47:09] then they arrest you
[47:11] all right so now the investigation is
[47:13] the first process
[47:17] then the second process in this
[47:20] prosecution of an offender is the arrest
[47:23] of assess of a suspect
[47:28] so if they investigate on you
[47:32] to find out whether or not you are an
[47:35] offender
[47:37] then they find saying that there is some
[47:40] incriminating evidence
[47:45] but indeed you are a
[47:49] suspective then the police will arrest
[47:52] you
[47:54] so an artist involves taking a person
[47:57] into custody cut your quiet
[48:00] for the purpose of holding the suspect
[48:03] until the suspect is arraigned to cut
[48:06] your Moon
[48:15] yes then the third process is
[48:18] the prosecution of a criminal defendant
[48:26] they prosecute them
[48:29] they prosecute them like you see one
[48:32] deciding whether to charge a person with
[48:35] a crime
[48:39] is it prosecutors way many factors
[48:43] [Music]
[48:44] including the seriousness of the offense
[48:50] and the strength of the evidence
[48:55] so then this suspect
[49:00] is now A Reign before
[49:06] you see that's the fourth stage
[49:09] before the trial
[49:12] the defendant appears in court
[49:18] and then enters
[49:22] you see when when if they you know
[49:26] they've arrested you and they suspected
[49:29] that you stole something
[49:31] then they bring you before a judge
[49:35] and I think we call it you know the doc
[49:38] the docker foreign
[49:44] [Music]
[50:16] what is your plea where where was that
[50:20] and then there is always two sides of
[50:23] the priest
[50:25] you will say
[50:27] yes I'm guilty oh
[50:31] you will say no I am not
[50:35] you see that is your part to do
[50:39] you accept
[50:41] the accusations
[50:45] amen are you following me so far okay
[50:49] you're good students then the Third
[50:52] that if you if you uh then there is a
[50:56] the the next process or the next day
[51:00] the fifth stage is trial
[51:07] you see no no no trial
[51:11] what's the same adjudication of guilt
[51:13] what's the same with a prosecutor and
[51:17] that under defense attorney uh
[51:19] participating a trial is held before a
[51:21] judge or jury
[51:23] yes
[51:39] you see
[51:42] the standard of evidence for a criminal
[51:45] conviction is guilt
[51:49] [Music]
[51:51] his guilt Beyond reasonable
[51:58] less than 100 certainty but more than
[52:02] high probability if there is doubt based
[52:05] on reason the accused is entitled to be
[52:07] acquitted
[52:14] if there is enough proof
[52:17] that what you are accused oh
[52:23] foreign
[53:38] a judge meets out a sentence
[53:42] gospel sentences include a fine
[53:49] probation
[53:52] a period of incarceration in a
[53:54] correctional institution
[53:58] such as jail or in prison
[54:03] for a given period of time but
[54:06] then when the Judgment has been given
[54:11] that is the end of that case
[54:15] are you following me when a judgment has
[54:18] been given um
[54:21] then you just have to abide by what the
[54:24] judges said
[54:27] but if in any way you feel maybe this
[54:30] judge was not fair
[54:34] and you you you feel you still have a
[54:37] curse to present
[54:43] that the judge did not have before
[54:47] giving you a passing judgment on your
[54:49] case
[54:54] then you go and do what we call
[54:57] appealing
[55:00] so you go to the court of appeals
[55:03] and you file your curse again
[55:08] so that the Judgment can be reversed
[55:12] and then the case will return again to
[55:15] be tried
[55:19] for the trial I mean are you following
[55:23] me
[55:25] all right
[55:27] sister Grace
[55:29] all right now
[55:32] but if in any case
[55:36] you still found guilty
[55:39] and you are sentenced by a judge
[55:42] then you are only going for one thing
[55:44] punishment
[55:49] s do not serve the complete term and are
[55:53] released before the expiration of their
[55:55] maximum sentences
[56:03] release may be obtained by serving the
[56:05] maximum sentence
[56:15] or you might be you might receive an
[56:19] early release
[56:22] now
[56:51] we all as human beings
[56:54] we are made or created in the image of
[56:58] God
[57:00] so the Bible says in the Book of Genesis
[57:03] chapter 1 verse 27.
[57:07] in his own image
[57:10] the image of God created male and female
[57:13] who created
[57:17] so now man was in the image of God
[57:21] are you hearing me man was perfect like
[57:24] God
[57:26] was sinless
[57:37] and so but then something happened when
[57:40] sin came in
[57:43] and the Bible says you see in Genesis
[57:46] chapter 2 verse 16 and the Lord God
[57:47] commanded the man saying
[57:51] foreign
[57:55] [Music]
[58:51] committed
[59:51] foreign
[1:00:00] foreign
[1:00:38] [Music]

[1:00:54] remember this is the ultimate sentence
[1:01:02] there is something I'm trying to build
[1:01:04] your mind
[1:01:11] can we say it one more time death death
[1:01:13] Death

[1:01:22] I mean did we get that picture together
[1:01:25] all right I want you to get this
[1:01:27] properly
[1:01:28] because in the next few moments I wanted
[1:01:31] to understand what I want to get to
[1:01:32] because
[1:01:36] he was going to attract the ultimate
[1:01:39] sentence
[1:01:57] that was the ultimate sentence
[1:02:03] and Adam was called his baby
[1:02:08] Adam was a child of God
[1:02:11] was in the image of God
[1:02:17] Adam was
[1:02:27] but I want you to know you can eat
[1:02:30] everything

[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:53] foreign
[1:05:32] [Music]

[1:05:54] originally
[1:06:44] [Music]

[1:07:06] foreign
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:37] on the word

[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:17] and she did not wait for us
[1:08:21] Army way
[1:08:24] what happened there
[1:08:26] it became silent
[1:08:30] next time
[1:08:33] the serpent was out of the picture
[1:08:38] we are seeing Adam and Eve
[1:08:42] and Eve was telling others I'm
[1:08:53] foreign
[1:09:19] he's the tree of life
[1:09:20] he said I'm the way the truth the life
[1:09:23] is

[1:09:37] characters
[1:09:53] foreign

[1:10:47] gave to him
[1:10:54] they did the same act back
[1:10:56] that was introduced
[1:11:01] but before she came to Adam
[1:11:06] this is a mystery what you are hearing
[1:11:09] now you can never hear it in any
[1:11:12] denominations
[1:11:21] this is exclusive
[1:11:24] because it's a revealed mystery
[1:11:27] because we have a prophet in our
[1:11:29] generation
[1:11:30] who came to us with a message
[1:11:42] that have received the full Revelation
[1:11:47] hallelujah amen even a doctor theology
[1:11:50] doesn't know this no massage

[1:15:02] but now we know nature because we had
[1:15:05] the world
[1:15:08] hallelujah amen the seed of God in you
[1:15:12] will always say Amen to every word
[1:15:20] and so I walk the swords that sin amen
[1:15:24] so who which sold sin
[1:15:27] we saw the sins
[1:15:32] that says Adam
[1:15:35] no one was able to live even for one day
[1:15:40] the Bible says to God one day is a
[1:15:43] thousand years and a thousand years to
[1:15:44] God is one day
[1:15:51] do we know the longest living man on

[1:16:57] all the human race
[1:17:00] has lived for not more than one day
[1:17:05] no man has ever lived
[1:17:09] because all of us are born in sinatus
[1:17:13] the way we are born we are born in a
[1:17:17] perverted way
[1:17:18] we were not to be born amen by by the
[1:17:23] lust of the flesh

[1:19:42] word that is going to take me out of it
[1:19:50] I am thinking of the Raptors
[1:19:53] hallelujah amen why do we get up in our
[1:19:57] souls
[1:19:59] foreign
[1:20:27] [Music]

[1:21:22] no condemnation
[1:21:25] to them that are in Christ
[1:21:30] who work not after the flesh
[1:21:33] we are not working according to our
[1:21:36] natural birth
[1:21:38] we are working out for the spirit
[1:21:42] We Are Spiritual Beings
[1:21:50] that life is

[1:22:34] someone had to die
[1:22:38] in order
[1:22:40] foreign
[1:23:49] and there is none of them will be saved
[1:23:52] none of them will be saved are you
[1:23:56] hearing me today because none of them
[1:23:58] can pay the price
[1:24:00] is too heavy um
[1:24:08] I know all of them are poor fellows

[1:25:16] man
[1:25:17] who came and said I have taken their
[1:25:21] land they can't redeem it back because

[1:25:50] we did not understand that this one is
[1:26:03] yes it was
[1:26:06] a very big price
[1:26:10] Jesus Christ

[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:17] tomorrow
[1:53:35] brother's wallet doesn't well it's
[1:53:39] it had to be a worthy enough money
[1:53:44] you remember what brother Ephraim
[1:53:46] preached to us
[1:53:51] she said who is worthy yeah
[1:54:01] John was weeping
[1:54:03] there was one of the illness
[1:54:24] where is this lion
[1:54:37] it was already dead
[1:54:41] and the blood was all over no more signs
[1:54:53] he realized it was the Lambs
[1:55:00] Jesus Christ
[1:55:10] his wallet was worthy enough money
[1:55:14] hallelujah amen and Jesus yes sir that's
[1:55:18] why you're baptized in his name
[1:55:21] that's why we
[1:55:23] bother you if you are not yet baptized
[1:55:26] in his name is
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:29] you have not
[1:55:31] the Bible says you have not put on
[1:55:32] Christ
[1:55:35] you have to be baptized in the name of
[1:55:39] Jesus Christ
[1:55:40] for the remission of your sins
[1:55:43] because his wallet alone
[1:55:50] so now Boaz represented Christina
[1:55:54] and then here he says and then he had to
[1:55:56] make a public testimony that he had done
[1:55:57] it
[1:56:01] and then it was his property
[1:56:05] can you imagine that he can say here
[1:56:07] that you whatever he redeems
[1:56:12] it is his property
[1:56:23] what did Jesus
[1:56:28] yes God bless you who else is
[1:56:44] foreign
[1:56:54] I am his property that's why when we are
[1:56:58] praying for the sick
[1:56:59] we have a right to tell the devil sit
[1:57:03] down take your hands off of God's
[1:57:04] Property
[1:57:06] and when the devil hears that stand in
[1:57:09] my Holiness
[1:57:13] you know when someone is trying to
[1:57:15] become a squat on your land
[1:57:18] if you come with a paper plus here is
[1:57:21] the proof this is the Land Titles
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:31] but Jesus yes whatever he redeemed he is
[1:57:35] not willing to negotiate with the devil
[1:57:38] he is not willing to negotiate
[1:57:41] he only understands one language to tell
[1:57:45] the devil to walk away from his property
[1:57:51] when the Israelites were going to Pro to
[1:57:53] claim their land are they say they're
[1:57:55] back in the bank
[1:57:57] God did not tell them go and have
[1:58:00] treaties
[1:58:01] with the people of that Land by the way
[1:58:05] you are seeing what is happening in
[1:58:06] Palestine now Palestine
[1:58:09] because of the same thing
[1:58:13] you know the others are saying it is our
[1:58:15] land
[1:58:17] here for ages
[1:58:23] God gave us this land
[1:58:27] and the world is saying
[1:58:30] you can have a treaty
[1:58:34] a two Nation agreement
[1:58:39] but this is what he's saying I don't
[1:58:42] know about that favorites what do we
[1:58:44] know it is
[1:58:55] so don't negotiate with your enemy
[1:58:58] if the enemy is bringing you sickness
[1:59:03] if the enemies
[1:59:07] I want to say and declare today
[1:59:13] we are going to claim and possess what
[1:59:16] belongs to us
[1:59:21] hallelujah amen whatever belongs to us
[1:59:24] to Nature the devil has not right
[1:59:27] we are his property
[1:59:38] Romans 8 3
[1:59:41] what the law could not do in that it was
[1:59:43] weak through the flesh God sending his
[1:59:46] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:59:48] and for sin condemned the seed in the
[1:59:50] flesh

[2:00:27] to overcome sin
[2:00:30] and remove its Penance
[2:00:34] to remove this power of sins
[2:00:39] are you hearing me the Lord didn't have
[2:00:42] that ability
[2:00:46] to remove the penalties
[2:00:53] recorded
[2:01:26] and it has come to an extent
[2:01:31] is what the works of the law
[2:01:36] is going to give us salvation
[2:01:41] sincerely
[2:01:43] tell me what work of the law can give us

[2:02:52] not he says it could not remove penalty
[2:02:55] of seeing all the power of sins
[2:02:59] you see the law in itself
[2:03:04] so the people who were under the law
[2:03:08] they were under bonded the

[2:08:32] at this bird
[2:08:38] now you're quiet
[2:08:39] because we are not too sure why is
[2:08:41] Pastor going that direction
[2:08:50] but here's what I want to tell you
[2:08:52] the Lord the Bible says the law was
[2:08:55] righteous
[2:08:59] because it was given by a righteous God
[2:09:03] it was given to the unrighteous people
[2:09:08] and because of that the law in itself
[2:09:13] did not help them to overcome sins
[2:09:18] the law in itself
[2:09:20] did not remove the penalties
[2:09:24] they did not remove the power of sins
[2:09:32] because
[2:09:35] somebody always
[2:09:49] and whenever they're talking about
[2:09:51] fornication
[2:09:59] foreign
[2:10:09] [Applause]
[2:10:52] and you're telling that child
[2:10:54] at 15 years
[2:11:01] will not help the child
[2:11:06] if that child a man or at that age kumia
[2:11:09] cage has not received the character
[2:11:13] yet and the ability to know
[2:11:17] that if I go to the Lord I'll be knocked
[2:11:21] then the law will not happen
[2:11:25] so you have a lot of people like that
[2:11:29] who are living in
[2:11:33] but they are really trying to just abide
[2:11:37] by the laws of the message
[2:11:46] you find us people around Parable they
[2:11:48] are like the richest
[2:12:00] and Jesus told him yes
[2:12:26] I've watched and kept but then all these
[2:12:30] rules
[2:12:35] but he is some
[2:12:36] how
[2:12:39] um
[2:12:44] that's why he was asking
[2:12:47] what else can I do
[2:12:50] it's not about another thing you can do
[2:12:56] is somebody getting it
[2:12:59] this young man
[2:13:01] he needed to understand
[2:13:03] it wasn't about another thing he can do
[2:13:07] it wasn't another work
[2:13:11] s
[2:13:23] entirely another work
[2:13:27] somebody else
[2:13:32] Jesus told him yes
[2:13:34] okay because if you have done all those
[2:13:38] Jesus did not tell him yes it's for
[2:13:41] nothing
[2:13:44] in fact Jesus told him go and do this
[2:13:48] but when he realized he has kept them
[2:13:51] then he brought something else or
[2:13:54] whatever I'm going to bring now
[2:13:55] is not for the lock Breakers
[2:14:01] foreign
[2:14:45] okay foreign
