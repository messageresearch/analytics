[30:38] the truth is
[30:47] a prophet God sent in this place
[30:53] what spoke through that Prophet is
[30:57] [Music]
[31:01] the words God gave the prophet are the
[31:04] ones we are going to speak
[31:07] and I believe
[31:11] that God wants to talk to someone
[31:14] through those words

[34:17] [Music]
[34:21] foreign
[34:30] [Music]
[34:38] [Music]
[34:49] foreign
[34:57] [Music]
[35:09] PC
[35:16] Eddie not again someone
[35:22] is
[35:34] foreign
[36:03] message says hear the voice of God
[36:08] [Music]
[36:13] ladies and gentlemen when gold called us
[36:16] from the world
[36:20] I remember there are certain words that
[36:23] you use we used to confess
[36:27] they told us say go today
[36:31] um
[36:32] [Music]
[36:37] I ask you to be the Lord
[36:40] of my life and my savior amen amen every
[36:43] time
[36:48] in those two words there is a word which
[36:51] says the Lord Of My Life
[36:55] [Music]
[36:56] foreign
[37:11] [Music]
[37:31] praise God
[37:46] they
[37:52] have enough money to make the right
[37:55] decisions
[37:59] foreign
[38:06] [Music]
[38:07] to pray at night they say
[38:10] that these preachers money answers
[38:13] everything is
[38:20] so the Lord become peace their savior
[38:23] but not the Lord of their life
[38:37] that's why in this Christian Journey we
[38:40] have encountered
[38:42] troubles
[38:44] strongholds that were announcements
[38:49] when we are not meant to pass through it
[38:59] we are in the message hear his voice
[39:04] um on paragraph 50. I want you to put it
[39:06] there so that we follow through I'm not
[39:09] going to speak but I want the voice of
[39:11] this the prophet to speak to us tonight
[39:14] amen man amen
[39:18] the voice of God
[39:22] the prophet says here
[39:29] hearing his voice in that day was a rare
[39:33] thing to
[39:38] um
[39:39] there was no open vision
[39:45] and it was a rare thing
[39:50] the real voice of God
[39:55] because the people had gotten away
[40:03] they had a church
[40:12] they had a church and they used to pray
[40:15] as us we come and pray amen amen
[40:22] ladies and gentlemen being saved and
[40:25] coming to church that is only not enough
[40:29] foreign
[40:43] because the church takes no one to
[40:46] Heaven amen amen
[40:50] let's go on
[40:52] they had a church in that day
[40:56] but they just didn't follow the
[40:59] Commandments of the Lord
[41:05] they had a minister by the name of Ellie
[41:11] brother the message is 58 10 05 m
[41:20] 58 10 0 5 and 5m hear his voice hear his
[41:26] voice
[41:29] they hired the minister by the name of
[41:31] Ellie
[41:33] um
[41:35] and he had got away from God
[41:41] I mean
[41:48] ladies and gentlemen it is easy for
[41:51] someone to be a minister when he left
[41:54] God
[41:58] it is possible for someone to be saved
[42:01] yet they they left God
[42:05] lives not his people
[42:09] the people of God are the ones who leave
[42:11] him come on Amen
[42:26] because God does not leave his place
[42:29] it's the people who leave their place
[42:32] service
[42:42] and people used to come in services
[42:50] but in those days the voice of God was
[42:53] limited Amina amen
[42:57] and it just became a place where the
[43:01] offering was the main thing
[43:03] is
[43:15] the church had become that sowing a seed
[43:19] offering had become the main important
[43:22] thing in the city amen
[43:25] I mean
[43:31] the Church of today
[43:36] and somewhere just careless about the
[43:40] way that he handled the Commandments of
[43:44] the Lord
[43:45] and cut it somewhere
[43:57] today
[43:59] we go to church and we find the people
[44:03] going on and having a great time
[44:06] together
[44:14] they sing they jump God has done great
[44:17] things
[44:19] my Miracle is here
[44:21] [Music]
[44:26] they
[44:30] go back home
[44:32] services
[44:57] foreign
[45:00] hearing the voice of God is not one of
[45:04] the major things but it is the major
[45:06] thing in the life of a Christian
[45:10] okay
[45:28] foreign
[45:51] men and women used to pray all night and
[45:55] their homes were set in order by the
[45:59] book of the Lord and the God was fast in
[46:02] their home
[46:03] see
[46:07] never
[46:10] foreign
[46:29] let me tell you Brethren God is
[46:32] interested in Every Beat Of Our Lives
[46:54] foreign
[47:19] [Music]
[47:26] you can't have the prayer meeting
[47:28] because Mr Godfrey is on tonight
[47:56] foreign
[48:16] we talk to God too much but we never
[48:19] give him time to talk back to us
[48:22] prayer is a two-way traffic you talk to
[48:26] God and he answers you back
[48:28] foreign
[48:41] that is if your prayer life is talk talk
[48:44] talk and there is no answer answer
[48:46] because some of us will think answers
[48:49] are God giving us what we prayed for
[48:53] 201 is
[49:08] very many times we pray and we put we we
[49:12] put together
[49:40] so many times we complain and they say
[49:43] God doesn't answer but God answers but
[49:46] we don't listen again
[49:50] [Music]
[49:57] foreign
[50:08] God answers every prayer but his way
[50:22] again
[50:29] foreign
[50:50] but he answers the prayers easy way
[51:09] the prophet says we don't wait long
[51:13] enough
[51:15] foreign
[51:28] because when the word comes and the
[51:31] spirit has come
[51:33] and the services over it is there is a
[51:36] time you need to to sit back a little
[51:39] and Ponder and think or lose
[51:51] foreign
[52:07] the prophet was saying hear the voice of
[52:13] God what you're praying for have you
[52:16] taken time after speak speak have you
[52:19] taken time to listen listen listen
[52:20] listen
[52:28] foreign
[52:50] now listen to the prophet
[52:54] the prophet is saying that we are always
[52:56] rushing and actually he's calling these
[52:59] things a bit to papier no sense
[53:07] [Music]
[53:08] tomorrow they may not be going to work
[53:10] but at least after this I've give it
[53:12] some few moments kneel down stay in your
[53:15] chair close your eyes think about the
[53:18] world
[53:19] think about the word
[53:24] but you finish the service three out in
[53:26] the compounds
[53:29] yes
[53:44] right
[53:48] that takes up time and we don't have
[53:51] time to hear the voice of the Lord
[53:54] and those who claim to be Christians
[54:00] brother told him those who claim to be
[54:02] what
[54:03] Christians just kneel down
[54:06] a little prayer like this kind of
[54:09] homemade Lord bless me and my family and
[54:13] take care of us good night
[54:16] foreign
[54:44] we should wait on the Lord
[54:51] one of the things which helped me grow
[54:53] in my Christian Life in my areas I was
[54:56] told that a Christian should have quiet
[54:59] time alone with the Lord
[55:03] when you wake up in the morning after
[55:05] prayer get some time and keep quiet
[55:10] and and just sway out there
[55:20] I want to hear what I've what do you
[55:23] have in store for me tonight
[55:34] [Music]
[55:37] God is so concerned even to the smallest
[55:41] things in our lives
[56:18] be on time
[56:21] we would wait on the Lord
[56:53] we are running lives so fast
[56:59] um
[57:07] the world has parted us apart into
[57:10] pieces
[57:12] that we don't have anymore
[57:19] God speaks katonda yogira
[57:23] foreign
[57:34] if we would pray pray until our souls
[57:38] come out into the presence of God
[57:43] um
[57:50] if we would pray
[57:52] until our souls comes into the presence
[57:54] of God and then after just relax and
[57:58] listen to his voice
[58:01] foreign

[2:03:53] [Music]
[2:03:57] this is Esther for about five five
[2:03:59] minutes your name skipped my mind but
[2:04:02] the Holy Spirit kept on bringing
[2:04:04] your face to me and
[2:04:06] emphasizing these words which I just
[2:04:09] want to speak to you as we close the
[2:04:11] service tonight
[2:04:17] foreign
[2:04:21] [Music]
[2:04:37] those are the words that the Holy Spirit
[2:04:39] spoke to me about you
[2:04:44] and I want you all to believe that the
[2:04:46] holy spirit is here and spoken to you
[2:04:48] concerning your life
[2:04:50] if you've asked him to speak to you say
[2:04:53] Lord speak to me
[2:04:55] he is faithful he never fails
[2:04:59] he knows what every one of us needs
[2:05:02] he knows your desires
[2:05:05] he knows your needs
[2:05:07] [Music]
[2:05:08] and if you continue to consecrate you
[2:05:10] are he has only spoken to you because he
[2:05:12] loves you
[2:05:15] it is unusual for it to be this way
[2:05:21] but you see he said my word will not
[2:05:24] return unto me void
[2:05:27] if God speaks
[2:05:29] then Vindication will always follow it's
[2:05:32] not planned but alwanga was not supposed
[2:05:34] to preach today
[2:05:37] Brother Martin was supposed to be the
[2:05:38] one to preach tonight
[2:05:43] but because he was not able to even come
[2:05:46] to the fellowship because he's sick
[2:05:50] somehow the Holy Spirit just spoke to me
[2:05:52] say ask brother luanga to speak I know
[2:05:55] he was not ready also to speak he said
[2:05:57] I'm not ready but I'll try and the Holy
[2:05:59] Spirit will have his way
[2:06:01] this was the Holy Spirit speaking to us
[2:06:03] Beyond Reasonable Doubt
[2:06:06] it's not about me it's not about
[2:06:07] badawanga it is God vindicating his word
[2:06:10] god confirming his presence with us
[2:06:13] establishing his presence confirming
[2:06:15] that he's with us
[2:06:17] and if we had it not our hearts friends
[2:06:19] he wants to do much more in our lives
[2:06:22] he wants to move our mountains he wants
[2:06:24] to confirm his presence he wants to okay
[2:06:30] but shall We Believe shall we open our
[2:06:33] hearts shall we accept his presence
[2:06:34] shall we believe when he speaks to us
[2:06:38] [Music]
[2:06:39] that's the challenge
[2:06:42] so the service tonight has been God
[2:06:45] speaking to us oh praise God
[2:06:48] not as speaking to him but him speak to
[2:06:51] us
[2:06:52] and what a fellowship what a fellowship
[2:06:54] with the Holy Spirit
