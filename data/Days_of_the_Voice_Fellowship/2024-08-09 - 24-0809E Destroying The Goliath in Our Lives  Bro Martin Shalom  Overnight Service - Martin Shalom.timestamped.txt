[31:29] Jesus gave us
[31:34] Victory
[31:40] um I want us to
[31:43] read scripture in
[32:09] okay I have some several of them but let
[32:12] us first read uh in the book of 1
[32:19] Samuel then we shall read another other
[32:21] scriptures
[32:31] reading 1 Samuel chapter 17:
[32:39] 50 First
[32:43] Samuel chapter
[32:47] 17
[32:49] uh vers
[32:55] 50 to 53
[33:06] uh so David
[33:08] Prevail prevailed over Philistine with a
[33:12] sling and with a stone and smot the
[33:16] Philistine and slew him but there was no
[33:20] sword in the hands of David there David
[33:24] ran and stood up up and stood upon the
[33:27] Philistine and took his sword and Drew
[33:30] it out of his uh sheet thereof and slew
[33:35] him and cut off his head therewith and
[33:39] when the Philistines saw their Champion
[33:42] was dead they fled and the men of Israel
[33:47] and Judah Rose and shouted and pursued
[33:49] the Philistine until Thou come to the
[33:52] valley and to the gates of erron and and
[33:57] the wounded and the wounded of the
[33:59] Philistines fell down by the way to
[34:03] shim even with G and unto
[34:08] Eon Precious Jesus we thank you
[34:13] Lord for the portion of the scripture we
[34:15] have read and other scriptures we have
[34:18] to read yet we ask you that you bless it
[34:22] in Jesus name
[34:25] amen you may have your seat
[34:38] blessed be the name of the
[34:41] Lord yeah tonight I want us to talk
[34:43] about Goliath
[34:46] amen and uh I call my simple
[34:52] sharing
[34:55] destroying Goliath
[35:00] in our
[35:02] lives blessed be the name of the
[35:06] Lord all Bible reader we know about who
[35:10] Goliath was and also we know of the
[35:15] David and remember in this very
[35:21] scripture Goliath was a Philistine amen
[35:25] and the Israel they were
[35:28] uh they are going they going the
[35:31] war and then there was a giant man
[35:34] called
[35:37] Goliath blessed be the name of the Lord
[35:41] so during that time Israel they had uh
[35:44] they were battling with the
[35:46] Philistine and that battle you realize
[35:49] that
[35:51] uh even today the battle is still raging
[35:54] blessed be the name of the Lord but in
[35:57] this
[35:59] we are seeing
[36:03] here that
[36:05] uh if I start with this quote the
[36:08] prophet say that the spirit of Goliath
[36:12] represent big enemies and giant problems
[36:17] amen if you are currently battling with
[36:20] a situation or
[36:24] an entity that is threatening your peace
[36:28] harassing you and intimidating you you
[36:32] are facing Goliath and if there is a
[36:34] situation or entity that is seeking to
[36:38] enslave you you are facing Goliath
[36:42] blessed be the name of the Lord but I'm
[36:44] here to tell you this evening that uh we
[36:48] have God Amen who is mighty in battle we
[36:54] have God who fights our battle blessed
[36:56] be the name of the Lord
[36:58] and each time you should not forget that
[37:00] every time there is a Goliath you just
[37:02] know that there is a David somewhere
[37:05] blessed be the name of the Lord when you
[37:07] see goliaths in your life you're seeing
[37:09] uh situation things you're going through
[37:11] in your life maybe hard times you are
[37:14] facing you just know within yourself
[37:18] amen within you there is a David samare
[37:22] who will have to face that Goliath
[37:24] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[37:27] amen and when we come back to this
[37:30] scripture uh we are seeing that
[37:39] uh uh there is a part that I want us to
[37:42] read
[38:09] uh and David was this is uh first Samuel
[38:14] chapter
[38:22] 17 okay we can begin from four it says
[38:25] and there went out a champion out of a c
[38:28] of fisan named Goliath of
[38:31] GTH whose height was six
[38:35] chit and a and a span and he had an
[38:39] element of
[38:41] brass upon his head and was armed with a
[38:45] coat of male and the weight of the coat
[38:48] was 5,000 shackles of
[38:51] brass blessed be the name of the Lord
[38:54] and he had a he had a g he had a grief
[38:57] of brass upon his leg legs and a target
[39:02] of brass between his
[39:04] shoulder and the staff of the spear was
[39:07] like a wavers beam and his Spear's head
[39:11] weighed 600 shekles of
[39:14] iron and one bearing a
[39:17] shield went before him amen and he stood
[39:22] and cried the armies of Israel and said
[39:25] unto them why are you come out to set
[39:28] your battle in aray and not I Philistine
[39:32] and you servant to Saul choose you a man
[39:36] for you and let him come to me and if he
[39:40] be able to fight with me and to kill me
[39:44] then we will be your servant but if I
[39:48] Prevail against him and kill him then
[39:51] you shall be our servants and serve
[39:55] us blessed be the name of of the
[39:58] Lord and the phis said I defy the armies
[40:01] of uh of Israel this day give me a man
[40:06] that we may fight together and when Saul
[40:10] and all Israel heard those words of
[40:14] philistine they were dismayed and
[40:16] greatly afraid blessed be the name of
[40:19] the
[40:21] Lord so this man came out and challenged
[40:24] them because according to him being that
[40:28] was Champion he was Warrior from his
[40:31] birth he knew that nobody in Israel
[40:35] would challenge him blessed be the name
[40:37] of the Lord but that is the mistake
[40:40] which the devil always make when he
[40:42] looks at the way you are the way God
[40:44] designed you he looks at your weakness
[40:48] he thinks he can finish you blessed with
[40:51] the name of the Lord but God always has
[40:54] a secret blessed be the name of the Lord
[40:57] for the Bible tells us uh the message
[40:59] tells us
[41:01] uh that uh God that is perfect strength
[41:06] in perfect weakness blessed be the name
[41:09] of the Lord and the David was okay and
[41:17] uh 12 says and now David was the son of
[41:20] the eph of uh Bethlehem Bethlehem Judah
[41:26] whose name was Jesse and had eight sons
[41:28] and the man went among men for an old
[41:33] man in the days of Saul and the three
[41:35] Elder son of Jesse went out followed
[41:38] Saul to the
[41:40] battle out jump and David was the
[41:45] youngest 16 says and the fisan

[42:19] how thy Brethren are faing on aair and
[42:23] take their pledges now Saul and now Saul
[42:27] and they and all the men of Israel were
[42:31] in the valley of Ella fighting with the
[42:34] Philistine and every rose up in the
[42:36] morning and left the ship with a keeper
[42:40] and took and went as Jesse had commanded
[42:43] him and he came to the trench as uh as
[42:47] the host was going forth to fight and
[42:50] shouted for the and shouted for the
[42:52] battle for Israel and the Philistines
[42:54] had put the battle in Array
[42:57] Army against Army and deid left his
[43:00] courage in the hand of The Keeper of the
[43:03] courage and ran into the army and came
[43:07] and saluted his Brethren and as he
[43:10] talked with them behold there came up a
[43:13] champion the philis of goth
[43:17] Goliath by the name out of the armies of
[43:20] philis and spake according to the same
[43:23] word and David heard them blessed be the
[43:27] name of the
[43:29] Lord
[43:31] destroying goath in our
[43:34] lives praise be to God there are things
[43:38] in our
[43:39] lives that we Must Destroy them amen
[43:44] because God has given us everything in
[43:47] this time that we living in right from
[43:50] the first church age through all the
[43:53] generation God has equipped his church
[43:56] with his word
[43:57] blessed be the name of the Lord and the
[43:59] strength of the church lies in the word
[44:02] of God and as long as the church follows
[44:04] the word of God the church win or will
[44:08] win every battle blessed be the name of
[44:10] the Lord remember the story of Israelite
[44:13] that to begin with God had rejected Soul
[44:17] amen because God's intention was to lead
[44:21] the church remember Israel represented
[44:24] represents the church and God was to
[44:28] lead the church but the church reached
[44:32] somewhere down the road and they
[44:35] started fashioning after the world they
[44:39] started admiring the foreign tribes amen
[44:44] other people the way they are and that
[44:46] same mistake today the church is making
[44:49] the same mistake and we are seeing this
[44:52] from uh look at like the Pentecostal
[44:54] world where they have to go in the world
[44:58] and borrow what they do in the world and
[45:00] bring them to the church blessed be the
[45:02] name of the Lord and here we are seeing
[45:04] Israelites they were fighting the
[45:08] battle and regardless of the battle they
[45:10] were
[45:11] fighting
[45:13] God was supposed to be the one fighting
[45:16] their battles blessed be the name of the
[45:18] Lord and that quote which I read braam
[45:21] tells us that the spirit of Goliath
[45:25] represent big enemies
[45:29] all of us we have enemies in our
[45:31] lives because the prophet tells us the
[45:34] greatest enemy of yourself is yourself
[45:38] amen I'm my greatest enemy and if I can
[45:42] overcome myself then there's no enemy
[45:45] that can stand before you blessed be the
[45:47] name of the Lord and the spirit of go
[45:50] represent that big enemies and giant
[45:52] problems and if you are currently
[45:55] battling with a situation I know each
[45:57] one of
[45:58] us we are battling the situation in our
[46:02] lives but I'm here to tell
[46:05] you that we must overcome those goliaths
[46:09] in our lives because God has given us
[46:12] his word amen it is God fighting our
[46:16] battles and no matter what comes our way
[46:20] there is nothing that can take us away
[46:23] from the love of God which is in Christ
[46:26] Jesus amen there is no way we can go
[46:29] back there is no way we can backslide
[46:33] there's no way we can fall blessed be
[46:35] the name of the Lord there is no way we
[46:37] can be
[46:38] defeated amen if you read with me Romans
[46:42] chapter 8 vers 39 let us go there very
[46:48] fast Romans chapter 8
[47:10] all
[47:14] right let us begin from
[47:21] 35 it says who shall separate us from
[47:24] the love of Christ
[47:31] that's what this Bible tells us tells me
[47:36] who shall is that that's how it is right
[47:40] okay who shall separate us from the love
[47:43] of Christ shall
[47:45] tribulation or distress or persecution
[47:49] or famine or nakedness or PRS or sword
[47:56] as it is written
[47:57] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[48:00] long we are accounted as a sheep for a
[48:03] Slaughter n in all things we are more
[48:07] than conquerors through him that loved
[48:11] us amen for I'm persuaded that neither
[48:16] death nor
[48:18] life nor
[48:21] angels not of
[48:23] principalities not of powers no of
[48:27] things present not of things to come not
[48:31] of height not of depth not any creature
[48:37] shall be able to separate us from the
[48:39] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[48:44] lord amen you see there is nothing that
[48:49] can put us down Apostle Paul has
[48:51] mentioned almost everything lack death
[48:57] persecution amen and then he made a
[49:00] conclusion and say there is nothing that
[49:03] can separate us from the love of God
[49:06] which is in Christ Jesus blessed be the
[49:09] name of the Lord what we have to know
[49:11] that in this battle we are fighting in
[49:14] this life we are living we are not
[49:18] alone blessed be the name of the Lord we
[49:21] are walking with God whatever we are
[49:24] doing we are walking with with God
[49:28] Amen praise be to God so whichever
[49:32] things that comes our way God permits it
[49:36] and God sees it amen so we are seeing
[49:39] here back to uh our
[49:42] scripture that Israel they are
[49:47] fighting and the greatest challenge they
[49:49] had not all the
[49:52] Philistine the Philistine had a champion
[49:57] and that man was
[50:00] Goliath he was like War
[50:03] Machine he was like a
[50:06] monster
[50:09] amen until even the king of Israelite
[50:13] was
[50:14] scared because remember the Bible tells
[50:16] us that that
[50:18] Saul this man his shoulders was high
[50:21] amen
[50:31] but the
[50:35] other they had a
[50:38] monster
[50:39] amen and it was the one leading their
[50:43] army blessed be the name of the
[50:46] Lord
[50:49] amen so we have many things in our lives
[50:53] we have a lot of hindrances within us
[50:57] sometime even like in overnight you feel
[51:00] like going and something tells you there
[51:03] are some who have not come not because
[51:05] they are sick not
[51:08] because they are bad love but because
[51:12] simply something told them that don't go
[51:15] and they felt like not coming and they
[51:18] stayed at home blessed be the name of
[51:20] the Lord but the prophet said that when
[51:22] the Holy Ghost is in your heart you
[51:24] can't wait for those doors to open amen
[51:28] and David that's why David cried and
[51:30] said that God restore unto me the joy of
[51:34] my
[51:35] salvation when the joy of Salvation is
[51:38] in your heart brother sister amen you
[51:41] will hardly do in the service like
[51:46] this it is that joy that keeps us
[51:49] moving and that's what the devil fight
[51:52] most amen what keeps the Christian
[51:55] moving on it is the joy of Salvation
[51:59] that's what keeps your heart burning
[52:01] amen and when we sing and say that that
[52:04] it is burning within my heart we mean
[52:07] that Joy amen and that Joy is the Holy
[52:10] Ghost In Your Heart blessed be the name
[52:13] of the Lord the Holy Ghost will not take
[52:15] you to
[52:16] Bar he will not take you to the bar in
[52:19] the evening like this he will take you
[52:21] to the church amen the Holy Ghost will
[52:24] not take you to Gumble no sir he will
[52:28] not lead you to see wrong things blessed
[52:30] be the name of the Lord but he will
[52:33] guide you to see the right thing or to
[52:36] read the right stuffs blessed be the
[52:38] name of the Lord the holy spirit always
[52:40] will feed on the word of God praise be
[52:43] to God but many times you find that a
[52:46] week elaps the whole week when you have
[52:49] not been read one verse in your Bible

[52:55] problem it is because because you have
[52:56] Goliath within yourself amen but I'm
[53:00] here to tell you tonight that we have
[53:02] come to destroy all those Goliath in our
[53:05] lives amen and God want you to destroy
[53:09] your enemy The Prophet tells her that

[53:39] spend in prayer blessed be the name of
[53:41] the Lord and whatever is hindering you

[53:48] hindrances blessed be the name of the
[53:50] Lord the time the Israel the time they
[53:53] spent in the battle and there was no
[53:56] progress
[53:57] amen every day the Bible says they are
[54:00] there for 40 days just

[54:38] battle amen because it was God fighting
[54:41] their

[55:26] servant if we I challenge him and put
[55:29] him down we will be your servants
[55:32] amen blessed be the name of the Lord and

[55:49] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[55:52] from the
[55:54] West and his glory
[55:56] from the rising of the sun when the
[55:59] enemy shall come in like a flood then
[56:02] the spirit of God shall raise in a
[56:08] standard amen always God raise a
[56:12] standard because he want his name to be
[56:17] feared when the spirit when the enemy
[56:20] comes in like the flood God has always
[56:24] raised a standard if you read your Bible
[56:27] throughout your Bible you find each time
[56:30] the enemy rise like a flood each time
[56:33] you think that there is no solution amen

[57:09] used to call mental telepathy
[57:12] amen we are faced with a lot of
[57:15] challenges in our generation we are

[57:21] living in the time where science versus
[57:23] Faith amen Faith tells you this science
[57:27] tells you the other things blessed be
[57:29] the name of the Lord but thanks be to
[57:31] God that we have the word and the Bible
[57:34] tells us in Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus
[57:37] Christ is the same
[57:39] yesterday is the same
[57:42] today and
[57:44] forever the same mechanism he used to
[57:46] overcome the devil from the first day is
[57:49] still the same tactics and it will be
[57:52] still the same tactics blessed be the
[57:55] name of the Lord
[57:57] Lord amen butam say that we need today
[58:02] what we need today is the Life of Christ
[58:06] inside of us and that is what pufies not
[58:10] the
[58:11] outward but turned around color or
[58:15] degree of psychology or something it
[58:18] takes the power of resurrected Christ to
[58:21] make us what we should be amen and God
[58:25] has no no other plan than let the Holy
[58:28] Spirit Rule and reign in the
[58:32] church blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:35] the only way we can
[58:36] overcome is by letting the Holy Spirit
[58:40] Rule and reign in
[58:42] you you have to sacrifice yourself amen
[58:47] you have to lay down yourself blessed be
[58:50] the name of the Lord you have Surrender
[58:52] Your Will to God you have surrender your
[58:54] children you have to surrender your
[58:56] knowledge amen and let the Holy Spirit
[58:59] reign in your life blessed be the name
[59:01] of the Lord the prophet say that is the
[59:04] plan of God that's the purpose of God
[59:11] Amen praise the
[59:16] Lord
[59:22] amen you know they ought to be like
[59:24] David the man okay
[59:34] sorry okay let's read this quote First
[59:36] it says that
[59:39] uh
[59:41] so so you my brother and if there is no
[59:45] testing
[59:46] time then you haven't made your
[59:49] investment yet because your enemy is
[59:52] standing there with a hammer back on his
[59:55] gun
[59:57] with a bu string
[1:00:00] drowned and he is ready to shoot every
[1:00:04] poison dir that he can send every cult
[1:00:09] and every little idea and every
[1:00:12] intellectual giant like Goliath amen he
[1:00:16] sends them around like that look so
[1:00:21] taller than the Brethren that you are
[1:00:24] associating with you are little you you
[1:00:27] are little ignorant and unlearned
[1:00:30] Brethren he send such spiritual
[1:00:33] intellectual Giant and Big schools that
[1:00:36] can explain the whole thing away from
[1:00:39] you but you have made your
[1:00:42] investment and got your policies sted
[1:00:45] and sealed by the Holy Spirit and there
[1:00:48] is nothing going to rub it
[1:00:51] off blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:01:03] and then of course Saul trained his army
[1:01:07] so he said Oh my he had them Israel just
[1:01:12] knowing every which way to knock a spear
[1:01:16] off or to do anything but one day there
[1:01:21] came a challenger old
[1:01:24] Goliath and and brother is taken more
[1:01:28] than unintellectual training then it
[1:01:32] took a man that know something about
[1:01:35] supernatural blessed be the name of the
[1:01:37] Lord don't think that Israel were not
[1:01:40] trained they were well trained and in
[1:01:44] this quam says that they even knew how
[1:01:47] to Doge a
[1:01:49] spear how you could throw your
[1:01:54] spear hey amen and they thought that
[1:01:57] things would just be like that blessed
[1:02:00] be the name of the
[1:02:01] Lord but brother bam tells us that one
[1:02:04] day there came a
[1:02:08] challenger that's why you knowing the
[1:02:10] word is not
[1:02:12] enough you learning studying the Bible
[1:02:15] it's good but it's not
[1:02:17] enough amen because this men were
[1:02:21] skilled they were well trained in the
[1:02:23] Army amen they knew how to Doge Spears
[1:02:27] they knew how to fight they knew how to
[1:02:31] wrestle blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:33] but one day there came a challenger whom
[1:02:37] they could not wrestle with amen they
[1:02:40] needed something spal to engage that
[1:02:44] enemy blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:46] that's why the prophet tells us that to
[1:02:49] know him is life not to know words in
[1:02:53] fact not even to know the message but to
[1:02:56] know the author of the message to have
[1:02:59] the Holy Spirit in you to have the
[1:03:02] author of the word in you that is what
[1:03:05] make the difference blessed be the name
[1:03:07] of the Lord and he say that and brother
[1:03:10] it it taken more than an intellectual
[1:03:14] training it will take you more than an
[1:03:17] intellectual training blessed be the
[1:03:20] name of the Lord when we were in
[1:03:22] Pentecostal we had the Bible when in our
[1:03:26] Catholics we still had the Bible and the
[1:03:29] Evangel uh and we could go for those
[1:03:33] masses but you could not overcome even
[1:03:36] the Habit
[1:03:44] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:03:47] Lord you could repat those recite those
[1:03:53] Rosary the whole day
[1:03:56] every evening and every night and from
[1:03:59] there you will still even putting on
[1:04:01] those
[1:04:02] rosaries you will go
[1:04:05] and for those like uh who practice
[1:04:08] witchcraft somebody will bewish you even
[1:04:11] when he putting on those things because
[1:04:14] those things they have no power amen it
[1:04:18] is only the word of God that has power
[1:04:21] blessed be the name of the Lord amen we
[1:04:26] knew all those
[1:04:32] things but all those thing could not
[1:04:35] help
[1:04:36] us even when we're in Pentecostal the
[1:04:38] same
[1:04:40] thing we had the Bible they used to
[1:04:43] preach to us but that could not help us
[1:04:47] blessed be the name of the Lord it was
[1:04:50] good for them to preach to
[1:04:52] us brother Solon amen
[1:04:59] but that could not help
[1:05:02] us and this men were well
[1:05:05] trained in fact even just believing the
[1:05:08] message is not
[1:05:09] enough attending church is not enough
[1:05:13] it's good to attend Fellowship because
[1:05:15] the Bible tells us we should not forsake
[1:05:17] assembling together of saints but that
[1:05:21] is not enough you can attend all the
[1:05:24] services still you go to
[1:05:30] hell praise be to
[1:05:35] God God want us to go beyond
[1:05:39] that God want us to accept him in the
[1:05:42] power of his
[1:05:44] resurrection praise the Lord because
[1:05:47] this men were also soldiers like the
[1:05:49] other guys they also trained like them
[1:05:52] but one day there came a challenge which
[1:05:56] was abnormal
[1:05:58] amen praise be to
[1:06:14] God praise be to God goath told David
[1:06:18] that would Pierce him with his Spear and
[1:06:22] then carry him and the Falls of hair
[1:06:26] would fed on
[1:06:34] him unless in the presence of God you
[1:06:37] can't even lift your hands for two
[1:06:40] hours but just try lifting this phone
[1:06:43] like this for 10
[1:06:45] minutes you'll find you're fighting with
[1:06:48] gravity but this man says that he would
[1:06:51] Pierce him and carry him up or
[1:06:58] praise be to God he was abnormal to
[1:07:02] begin
[1:07:03] with this man they needed Supernatural
[1:07:06] power
[1:07:09] amen and they had it but they lacked the
[1:07:13] Revelation blessed be the name of the
[1:07:16] Lord amen and when goath was there
[1:07:20] raising dust that's when David visited
[1:07:24] the camp and that day Goliath never knew
[1:07:27] that something had happened amen that
[1:07:30] there was a revival going on in the camp
[1:07:33] of the Israelites blessed be the name of
[1:07:36] the Lord he thought is as usual because
[1:07:39] you have been shouting for the last 40
[1:07:41] days he comes and shout and goes back
[1:07:44] comes and shout and goes back but I'm
[1:07:46] here to tell you amen that your enemies
[1:07:49] they will not shout at you
[1:07:53] forever just keep on coming to church

[1:10:39] of God upon David amen and when the same
[1:10:43] situation Rose here that same feeling
[1:10:47] came back again David started feeling
[1:10:50] the same and he knew that there was a
[1:10:53] job to be accomplished
[1:10:56] blessed be the name of the Lord and he
[1:10:59] said and said that he said to the men of
[1:11:02] Israel do you mean to tell me that you
[1:11:05] will stand and let that uncircumcised
[1:11:09] Philistine defy the armies of the Living

[1:12:01] Lord for that God has always got
[1:12:04] somebody he will always have he had man
[1:12:08] he called to put his hand on Amen and
[1:12:12] when Goliath was on the land God had
[1:12:15] somebody who was willing to
[1:12:18] stand there must be a willingness to
[1:12:22] stand you are the deavid today he amen

[1:12:55] everything was paid on the cross of
[1:12:58] Calvary and Jesus gives us Victory he
[1:13:01] died and rose again and said because I
[1:13:04] overcome you will also overcome amen I
[1:13:08] give you power to tr over serpent you

[1:13:14] demons in your in my name blessed be the
[1:13:17] name of the
[1:13:18] Lord amen God is looking for somebody
[1:13:23] who is willing to stand
[1:13:26] and now is the time blessed be the name
[1:13:28] of the Lord what we had the Creeds and
[1:13:31] the dogmas could not give us Victory we
[1:13:35] are still living in shame and bondage
[1:13:37] praise be to God but God Amen rich in
[1:13:42] his Mercy he sent us the message of the
[1:13:45] hour showing us that our Victory lies in
[1:13:49] the word amen and now we have a restored
[1:13:53] word in of Our Generation
[1:13:56] blessed be the name of the Lord this
[1:13:58] people they heard God but they they only
[1:14:01] lacked experience with God what David
[1:14:07] had David had his personal experience
[1:14:11] with
[1:14:12] God this people they knew the god of our
[1:14:15] father the god of Abraham said the god
[1:14:18] of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god
[1:14:20] of Jacob but David had an experience
[1:14:24] with that God
[1:14:25] you know that this God is far far beyond
[1:14:28] just being read in the scroll or being
[1:14:33] mention in the word what he did to
[1:14:35] Abraham because one day that God saved
[1:14:38] him
[1:14:39] amen when the lion came that God proved
[1:14:44] to him that I am the god of Abraham and
[1:14:47] now I am your
[1:14:49] God blessed be the name of the
[1:14:52] Lord so David had an experience he knew
[1:14:56] what he was talking about he knew the
[1:14:59] god of his father he is still the same
[1:15:03] God and when he came to the camp and
[1:15:06] heard Goliath making
[1:15:09] noise I think even he had
[1:15:12] headache blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:15:15] and what David had his brothers did not
[1:15:18] have because he told them this man to
[1:15:21] begin is been
[1:15:23] uncircumcised and do you that you are
[1:15:25] the army of the Lord and this man is
[1:15:28] defying the army of the Lord blessed be
[1:15:30] the name of the
[1:15:31] Lord
[1:15:40] amen praise be to God what was David
[1:15:43] doing he was laying a strategy how was
[1:15:47] going to face his
[1:15:48] enemy this man is a Philistine M this
[1:15:52] man is uncircumcised he has no Covenant
[1:15:55] with God there's no way there is no way
[1:15:59] amen there's no way can defy the arm of
[1:16:02] the
[1:16:04] Lord since I have come now and have met
[1:16:08] that God and I have a personal
[1:16:10] experience with him now is the time
[1:16:14] blessed be the name of the Lord God had
[1:16:18] visited the camp of Israel in
[1:16:21] David and his brothers were wiing
[1:16:28] blessed be the name of the Lord and that
[1:16:30] is the same problem we are having even
[1:16:33] in the message
[1:16:34] Church you find other brothers other
[1:16:37] ministers attacking other
[1:16:40] ministers what the Same Same Spirit is
[1:16:43] not
[1:16:44] dead but we are fighting the common
[1:16:49] enemy praise be to God David asking
[1:16:53] question was for them
[1:17:11] good like that praise be to God but this
[1:17:16] man had a
[1:17:18] secret
[1:17:20] amen he was like Samson David had a
[1:17:24] secret
[1:17:28] which even Goliath did not
[1:17:31] know he thought this is ordinary
[1:17:34] Dixon brother let us receive the Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost amen the moment we receive the B
[1:17:42] of the Holy Ghost we are not commoners
[1:17:45] anymore but we are amate Gods
[1:17:51] amen praise be to God the reason I
[1:17:54] that's why the devil want to Trum on us
[1:17:57] is because we have not known who we are
[1:18:01] we have not received the portion of God
[1:18:03] in us amen and that's why I want to to
[1:18:13] you blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:18:16] that day something had happened praise
[1:18:20] be to God maybe David was there the
[1:18:23] Bible says he was a sheep but maybe was
[1:18:26] there one day and he felt of a feeling
[1:18:29] in him and he was praying for
[1:18:31] deliverance he was praying for victory
[1:18:34] and he didn't know why he was praying
[1:18:36] amen the Holy Ghost was moving on
[1:18:40] him and then maybe few days down the
[1:18:43] road his father called him and told him
[1:18:47] boy take this to your
[1:18:50] brothers and when he was going there
[1:18:54] something was telling him in his heart
[1:18:56] he had a strange feeling in him praise
[1:18:59] be to God Amen the Holy Ghost was
[1:19:03] ministering to
[1:19:06] him and when he reached
[1:19:09] there the enemy also rose that morning
[1:19:12] and
[1:19:13] came he started
[1:19:17] blaspheming why do you come with your
[1:19:19] enemy in church and you go back with him
[1:19:22] we come with habit and then we go back
[1:19:24] with the same
[1:19:26] habit praise be to God am the word of
[1:19:30] God it is purpose is to destroy the
[1:19:34] enemy of the
[1:19:37] word the devil operates in the body or
[1:19:40] in the human
[1:19:43] Veil so we should not allow to come with
[1:19:47] the Enemy and we go back with him let
[1:19:49] God crush your
[1:19:52] enemy amen if is a time for you to
[1:19:55] destroy your
[1:19:58] Goliath each one of us we know the
[1:20:01] Goliath we have in our
[1:20:05] lives others maybe butam say that if you
[1:20:09] used to pray and you no longer doing it
[1:20:11] you back lead start with that one if you
[1:20:16] used to First and nowadays it's so hard
[1:20:18] for you that is
[1:20:22] Goliath praise be to God if you used to
[1:20:25] come early to church and nowadays you
[1:20:28] you struggle you come late that is
[1:20:31] Goliath is a time you destroy your
[1:20:35] enemy blessed be the name of the
[1:20:44] Lord but in the message INF say that we
[1:20:47] know that you know we ought to be like
[1:20:50] David a man after God's Own Heart he
[1:20:53] said that he that the Lord is always
[1:20:56] before me and B say that wherever David
[1:21:00] Goes he remembered the
[1:21:02] Lord whever we go we should always
[1:21:06] remember the
[1:21:14] Lord listen when David got a
[1:21:18] sling
[1:21:20] amen and he throw it toward
[1:21:23] Goliath David knew who he
[1:21:26] was David knew what goliath
[1:21:29] was and David also knew what God was or
[1:21:33] who God was
[1:21:36] amen he was standing in the right
[1:21:39] place with the right word and he was
[1:21:43] facing the right enemy that's why the
[1:21:46] Bible says whosoever comes before God
[1:21:49] Must Believe first that he is
[1:21:54] God is and he reward those who seek of
[1:21:58] him
[1:22:00] diligently praise be to God and without
[1:22:04] faith it is impossible to please him
[1:22:07] David had faith in God he believed that
[1:22:10] God was there
[1:22:13] amen praise be to
[1:22:22] God God is so concerned about about us I
[1:22:26] was reading that scripture in Genesis
[1:22:28] chapter
[1:22:31] 2 where the Bible says that uh and God
[1:22:35] say that man should
[1:22:37] not be
[1:22:40] alone but abam says that uh the second
[1:22:44] thing greatest thing that God can give
[1:22:46] you that God gives you after
[1:22:49] salvation is our
[1:22:52] Good Good Wife
[1:22:56] God from the
[1:22:58] beginning he say it's not good for you
[1:23:01] to be alone but most time I was looking
[1:23:04] at it from another
[1:23:06] perspective of not just being
[1:23:09] married like having a sister or having a
[1:23:14] wife but God's intention for man God has
[1:23:18] never wanted man to be
[1:23:20] alone amen God always want to have
[1:23:23] fellowship with
[1:23:27] man and if the wife is the greatest
[1:23:30] second thing or give that God gives you
[1:23:35] after
[1:23:37] salvation then talk
[1:23:40] of the marriage with
[1:23:46] Christ blessed be the name of the
[1:23:49] Lord then what is the first greatest
[1:23:52] gift it is salvation
[1:23:57] praise the
[1:23:58] Lord so brethren we are not
[1:24:01] alone God always works with
[1:24:05] us and God wanted God had us in his
[1:24:11] plan praise be to God because even after
[1:24:15] creating the
[1:24:18] Angels still go say let us make
[1:24:23] man how
[1:24:32] Hallelujah wow I didn't know that he
[1:24:34] already
[1:24:40] living David knew who he
[1:24:43] was he had met
[1:24:46] God this words have been I've heard it
[1:24:50] for I think the last 20 years
[1:24:55] having personal experience with God
[1:24:57] personal God and we are hearing this
[1:25:02] again over and over until we get used to
[1:25:05] it without having personal experience
[1:25:08] with
[1:25:09] God but each each and every Christian
[1:25:13] must have a personal experience with
[1:25:22] God that is the only way to
[1:25:25] go men
[1:25:28] disappoint even great men will
[1:25:31] disappoint
[1:25:33] you that's why the singer said that
[1:25:36] friend when sickness lays you
[1:25:40] down a friend when time is at
[1:25:44] last amen Jesus will always be there
[1:25:49] because he has always been there for you
[1:25:53] before you were born
[1:25:55] when you were born the day you were born
[1:25:57] when you living on this Earth amen and
[1:26:00] even your last minute that Jesus is the
[1:26:03] one who will be
[1:26:06] there and it's always good to know that
[1:26:10] he is there you must create that
[1:26:12] relationship with
[1:26:18] him and that relationship comes through
[1:26:21] personal
[1:26:22] experience you could not convinced David
[1:26:25] that he never killed a lion because
[1:26:27] David killed a lion with his
[1:26:30] hands when you meet God no one can
[1:26:34] divert you from the
[1:26:37] truth because you met God
[1:26:41] alone you could not tell Jacob that you
[1:26:43] were just dreaming he will tell you sir
[1:26:46] I was not dreaming why he could even he
[1:26:50] could even take you there where he lled
[1:26:53] with
[1:26:56] Angel where did you wrestle with your
[1:27:00] angel is it in a cinema
[1:27:06] Hall is it in football
[1:27:10] pitch you must have an altar somewhere
[1:27:13] brother sister before the Rapture you
[1:27:16] must wrestle with an
[1:27:22] angel blessed be the name of the
[1:27:25] Lord you realize in the message that in
[1:27:27] a few
[1:27:29] places where you find talks
[1:27:32] about you going to hell somebody going
[1:27:35] to hell but many times he says that a
[1:27:40] sinner fight his way to
[1:27:44] Hell praise be to God God he say that
[1:27:47] God has not take any man to hell but man
[1:27:51] takes himself to hell how they will tell
[1:27:53] you
[1:27:55] you have a personal experience with God
[1:27:58] and you take it for
[1:28:00] granted be on fire for God and for you
[1:28:04] that's none of your business do this for
[1:28:07] God and it's like you also
[1:28:13] see by the time you realize you've
[1:28:16] reached your your books remember your
[1:28:20] book the day you were born it was open
[1:28:23] started
[1:28:30] writing blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:28:34] destroying goliaths in our
[1:28:36] lives in our
[1:28:41] homes God has given us that
[1:28:45] Authority whatever we bind on Earth he
[1:28:48] will bind in heaven
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:14] amen praise be to
[1:29:17] God and when he set that loose the Holy
[1:29:21] Ghost got a hold of that little old
[1:29:24] Stone and picked it up at a speed about
[1:29:29] 1,000 miles per second and strike that
[1:29:33] giant between the face and he fell
[1:29:36] forward hallelujah oh my amen the Holy
[1:29:40] Ghost grabbed that
[1:29:42] stone because he had the extion with
[1:29:45] that same Holy Ghost they were afraid
[1:29:48] with that Holy Ghost amen David was not
[1:29:52] alone
[1:29:54] and that's why when he was facing the
[1:29:56] enemy of Israelites that same Holy Ghost
[1:30:00] grabbed the stone and brother says the
[1:30:03] stone ran at 1,000 kilomet per
[1:30:09] second it was like in a blink of an eye
[1:30:37] I believe this was like in a blink of an
[1:30:40] eye praise be to
[1:30:43] God
[1:30:45] Amen so coming to church is like so with
[1:30:49] his uh Spears and armor like
[1:30:54] and all
[1:30:56] those so coming to church is it's good
[1:30:59] but not enough you have to go
[1:31:05] farther
[1:31:07] amen we are living in the time where
[1:31:09] every Christian ow to cry to God
[1:31:27] there are
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:46] people praise be to God
[1:32:01] what you have to know this body will
[1:32:03] never obey the word but you'll have to
[1:32:06] force it to obey you'll have to believe
[1:32:09] God that my flesh will obey every word
[1:32:12] of God and I will live above
[1:32:18] sin not because I'm perfect
[1:32:21] no but I'm also fighting against this
[1:32:24] flesh every single day when it speaks
[1:32:28] against the word I say My Flesh
[1:32:36] obey praise be to God that's why the
[1:32:39] Bible say let us lay aside every weight
[1:32:42] and every sin you can lay it aside it is
[1:32:46] possible to lay it aside because this
[1:32:49] says the bible let us lay aside every
[1:32:51] weight and every sin that was this will
[1:32:54] beset
[1:32:55] us after putting it aside let us
[1:33:00] run amen with patience toward the mark
[1:33:04] of High Calling The Mark of High Calling
[1:33:07] is in Christ Jesus and you cannot run
[1:33:09] there with your sins you have to lay it
[1:33:13] aside God rejected so he could not win
[1:33:17] their enemy God had to choose somebody
[1:33:20] else Amen to come and finish the job and
[1:33:24] if you're not willing to run let me tell
[1:33:26] you God will pick somebody

[1:33:36] hands to do be it outside there or in
[1:33:40] the service do it with all your heart
[1:33:44] because if you don't do it God is going
[1:33:47] to raise somebody else he going to pick
[1:33:49] someone else who will accomplish that
[1:33:52] job and you will be there
