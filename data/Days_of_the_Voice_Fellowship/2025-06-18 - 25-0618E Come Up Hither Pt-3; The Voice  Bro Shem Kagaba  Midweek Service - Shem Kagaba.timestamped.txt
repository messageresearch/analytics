[51:31] Let's pray. Oh dear heavenly father,
[51:33] king of glory this evening once again.
[51:38] We thank you for your mercies and grace.
[51:40] Lord,
[51:42] we thank you for everybody that is here.
[51:46] And Lord, we thank you for another
[51:47] chance that you have given us Lord
[51:52] to minister to your purchase, Lord
[51:53] Father.
[51:56] And Lord, there's nothing above
[52:00] above us gathering and feeding on your
[52:03] word.
[52:07] We thank you dear heaven father.
[52:11] May you come and break this little bread
[52:13] of life to us
[52:17] and what we need. We need our hearts to
[52:19] burn within us.
[52:23] Oh Lord, we thank you.
[52:26] and we welcome you in the name of our
[52:29] Lord Jesus.
[52:32] Amen. God bless you saints.
[52:37] God bless you musicians.
[52:40] Hallelujah. Amen. So as we still
[52:43] standing, let us read the book of
[52:44] Revelation 4
[52:51] from verse one.
[52:54] Okay.
[53:10] After this, I looked and behold, a door
[53:12] was open in heaven.
[53:16] And the first voice which I heard was as
[53:19] it were of a trumpet talking with me,
[53:24] which said, "Come up hither, and I will
[53:27] show thee things which must be
[53:29] hereafter."
[53:30] And immediately I was in the spirit, and
[53:34] behold, a throne was set in heaven,
[53:37] and one sat on the throne. Amen.
[53:43] for
[53:47] [Music]
[53:55] guarantee.
[54:23] May God bless the reading. Be seated.
[54:31] God bless each and every one of us.
[54:36] Again
[54:38] I I thank pastor for another opportunity
[54:41] to serve the bride.
[54:49] I had very many thoughts when I was told
[54:52] to preach
[54:58] and yesterday I prayed God to lead me
[55:04] and then because even uh the other part
[55:08] that we had last time we didn't finish
[55:09] it
[55:13] but I decided to take
[55:15] another direction but we are still on
[55:17] come up hither part three
[55:25] for the title it will be the voice we're
[55:27] talking on the voice
[55:33] maybe for a recap uh last time we talked
[55:36] about the judgment seal
[55:43] that how we we all come under the
[55:45] influence of that judgment seal.
[55:51] And the Lord uses it uses it to position
[55:53] the bride
[55:57] in her homeland
[56:00] spiritually speaking.
[56:03] And now we see that whenever we come at
[56:07] the under the influence of this seal,
[56:13] God just watches how we react.
[56:18] And from this seal
[56:22] it it
[56:25] either leads you to the seven
[56:32] or the mark of the beast
[56:36] like Kane when he came under the
[56:37] influence of this seal
[56:41] and then he said this is too much for
[56:42] me.
[56:45] Hallelujah. Amen. You know, but for us
[56:47] the children of God,
[56:51] we always understand that everything is
[56:52] for the good to them that that love God.
[57:00] Hallelujah. I mean, David, he said,
[57:03] but thy ro and thy stuff they comfort
[57:05] me.
[57:08] And I was thinking that as a shepherd of
[57:10] the flock, every good shepherd have
[57:18] the road
[57:20] and the staff.
[57:23] And we saw that being in position,
[57:28] it is far beyond our children,
[57:36] good life in this world.
[57:39] And that's why God can do anything to
[57:40] put you in position.
[57:45] He can even take your wife. He can take
[57:46] your children.
[57:50] He can take your job
[57:52] to position you.
[57:55] We see that position is more important.
[58:00] And then we saw that this bride has to
[58:03] be
[58:05] smitten by this road.
[58:10] Hallelujah. But because of time I didn't
[58:12] give you the the solution
[58:17] uh whenever we come under the influence
[58:24] of this seal. The only thing I gave it
[58:25] was the warning.
[58:31] But the solution is in James chapter 5
[58:38] verse 13
[58:41] he say that is any among you afflicted
[58:48] let him pray and we see that that's the
[58:51] only solution that gave us
[58:57] as far as this judgment is concerned And
[59:01] and then also we saw that every time
[59:03] whenever we come to church,
[59:07] we have come at the judgment throne of
[59:09] God,
[59:13] the judgment seat of God.
[59:17] And then
[59:18] now this is the solution of the children
[59:20] of God.
[59:25] First of all, you first calm
[59:29] And if you're afflicted, you pray. You
[59:31] go in prayer.
[59:35] But we see that the devil has given us
[59:37] another solution.
[59:41] And last time we're talking about
[59:42] dimensions a little bit.
[59:48] But the prophet talks about another
[59:50] dimension.
[59:54] It is the fourth dimension. The
[59:56] communication.
[59:59] But he calls it ether.
[1:00:04] Hallelujah. Amen. And now we see that he
[1:00:06] said that the devil came and manipulated
[1:00:09] that dimension
[1:00:14] into science.
[1:00:19] But that's the communic that's the
[1:00:21] dimension that God placed there
[1:00:26] to communicate with men.
[1:00:30] Hallelujah.
[1:00:32] It is it is accessed almost now by
[1:00:35] everyone
[1:00:39] the witch doctors
[1:00:42] the scientists.
[1:00:46] Hallelujah. He said now like for example
[1:00:48] he gave an example of the witch of end
[1:00:52] how was he able how was she able to
[1:00:54] communicate
[1:01:00] he said that she was uh she was uh
[1:01:05] getting the signals
[1:01:10] she was advice tapping the signals in
[1:01:13] the other dimension
[1:01:16] Hallelujah. And now even God uses a
[1:01:19] dimension to speak to us.
[1:01:24] Talk about visions.
[1:01:27] And also now the the prophet that's why
[1:01:29] he was able to preach the seals.
[1:01:34] And then he said that uh
[1:01:37] have have you seen this mysterious week
[1:01:39] that we have been having
[1:01:44] is meaning the week of the seals
[1:01:48] where the angels have been meeting me.
[1:01:53] And when he was preaching, he could be
[1:01:55] able to tap into that dimension
[1:02:01] where the angels were passing more
[1:02:04] and he could be able to pick the signal
[1:02:08] and he brings it to the bride
[1:02:11] using the gift
[1:02:13] and that's why even speaking in tongues
[1:02:16] seeing visions or so God can use that
[1:02:18] you can use that gift to penetrate and
[1:02:20] tap into the
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:02:26] And I want to cut it short. Then we go
[1:02:28] to the preaching of today.
[1:02:33] Now the devil
[1:02:36] first of all he first manipulated that
[1:02:38] dimension to science
[1:02:43] with an intention.
[1:02:46] And now we saw last time that
[1:02:49] people there are people here on earth
[1:02:54] who are living in hell.
[1:02:57] They don't go to hell when they die.
[1:03:02] Never.
[1:03:03] They just switch their place that they
[1:03:09] and like how it is that people are
[1:03:11] living in hell today.
[1:03:16] We have heard another voice
[1:03:20] telling us to come up hither.
[1:03:23] Hallelujah. And now like how people are
[1:03:25] living in hell
[1:03:29] and living in that dimension of science.
[1:03:34] I will give you an example.
[1:03:37] You remember under the opening of the uh
[1:03:40] fourth seal
[1:03:43] the prophet say that he his name was
[1:03:46] death
[1:03:49] and hell followed him.
[1:03:52] But where is he? Where is that guy?
[1:03:56] He's everywhere.
[1:03:58] He's on the pull pits. He's walking on
[1:04:00] the streets.
[1:04:03] You see?
[1:04:05] So if that guy is connected to people,
[1:04:12] then hell also is connected to him, not
[1:04:15] people.
[1:04:19] Because God never created hell.
[1:04:23] Hell came after when man fell.
[1:04:29] I mean when the devil fell.
[1:04:33] You see? So uh and before uh before the
[1:04:38] seals
[1:04:42] we see that the prophet I believe it was
[1:04:45] a vision
[1:04:48] when uh when he went in that dimension
[1:04:51] Was
[1:04:53] it a vision or he died? End of the two.
[1:04:56] He went into the fifth dimension.
[1:05:00] And then he saw something that he has
[1:05:02] never seen in his.
[1:05:05] He saw some conditions that were there
[1:05:09] and he saw these women
[1:05:14] like Jezebel
[1:05:16] putting on lipsticks,
[1:05:19] eyeballs,
[1:05:21] working on worked on their nails.
[1:05:25] And he talks about that I believe in the
[1:05:26] message souls that are in prison.
[1:05:32] And then these ladies,
[1:05:35] they were in a terrible condition
[1:05:37] and the condition was scaring to the
[1:05:39] prophet and then he cried and said,
[1:05:41] "Lord, get me out of here."
[1:05:45] You see, so when he came out
[1:05:49] later,
[1:05:51] he saw these women on on earth
[1:05:55] for the first time
[1:05:58] and he almost thought, "Have I gone back
[1:06:00] to hell?
[1:06:03] You see, hell is on earth
[1:06:08] and there are people that are living in
[1:06:09] that dimension.
[1:06:13] And I tell you that this dimension is
[1:06:14] connected to your bodies.
[1:06:18] It is not a place. It is an existence.
[1:06:23] It's not a place. It's an existence.
[1:06:28] You see, but but we've got to overcome
[1:06:31] it
[1:06:34] completely
[1:06:36] because we have received a voice
[1:06:40] that is separating us completely from
[1:06:42] that dimension
[1:06:45] where we are going up.
[1:06:48] Hallelujah. Amen. And now we see we see
[1:06:51] that
[1:06:53] when people get trouble
[1:06:58] even believers of the message
[1:07:02] instead of going to the other dimension
[1:07:06] of Revelation 4,
[1:07:10] they go to the dimension of the devil,
[1:07:15] WhatsApp WhatsApp communication.
[1:07:19] You see and now someone gets hurt
[1:07:24] they go on internet
[1:07:27] and they post all their feelings there.
[1:07:32] You see that is lack of revelation.
[1:07:37] You are first of all you have to
[1:07:39] understand that you are under the
[1:07:40] judgment seal of God.
[1:07:44] whatever troubles that you're going
[1:07:46] through
[1:07:50] and then we see that also Isaiah went
[1:07:52] through it
[1:07:54] and then he said he said woe is me Lord.
[1:07:59] Hallelujah. Amen. So the Bible tells us
[1:08:02] to break in the presence of God into
[1:08:04] prayer.
[1:08:08] And also maybe another thing that I may
[1:08:10] say on that
[1:08:12] you have to remember that the
[1:08:16] the lamp is in control of everything.
[1:08:21] It is a mystery
[1:08:23] that has been revealed.
[1:08:26] You remember in revelation chapter 5
[1:08:31] that pastor preached to us on Sunday.
[1:08:35] Um when you remember the voice that
[1:08:39] cried out
[1:08:41] which was the lamp in fact and they say
[1:08:44] that heart not the oil
[1:08:48] heart not the oil
[1:08:51] and the wine.
[1:08:55] It sounds like a commander
[1:08:59] which means you can do this but don't do
[1:09:01] this.
[1:09:04] You see, like Job,
[1:09:06] the devil first went to to God
[1:09:11] and everything that happened to him
[1:09:14] first pass through the desk check of
[1:09:17] Jehovah
[1:09:19] for him to say,
[1:09:22] you see, so it is the same with us.
[1:09:26] Everything that the devil is doing,
[1:09:29] God has sinned, has permitted.
[1:09:32] All that we need, we need just
[1:09:34] revelation
[1:09:37] and to understand
[1:09:40] that God is with us.
[1:09:43] And then we take the solution that the
[1:09:45] Bible gives us
[1:09:50] and then I'll pick it from Jericho.
[1:09:54] And we saw that the priest had to blow
[1:09:57] the the gospel trumpet.
[1:10:02] and people were to shout.
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:07] But before they shout,
[1:10:11] remember,
[1:10:15] they were given instructions,
[1:10:18] shout,
[1:10:20] but they were never told what to shout.
[1:10:24] They were never told what to say.
[1:10:28] You see? And now we see that
[1:10:31] let first read Joshua 5
[1:10:37] uh 15 and 14 say that and said unto him
[1:10:41] you know u
[1:10:44] Joshua
[1:10:45] one morning
[1:10:47] he was standing facing Jericho
[1:10:51] and then I believe he was thinking
[1:10:54] how are we going to bring it down
[1:10:58] and then As he was still looking at
[1:11:00] Jericho,
[1:11:02] then he saw a man
[1:11:05] standing before him
[1:11:08] with a sword.
[1:11:10] And this is what Joshua asked him and
[1:11:12] said unto him, "At thou for us
[1:11:16] or for our adversary?"
[1:11:20] And he said, "Nigh,
[1:11:22] but as captain of the host of the Lord,
[1:11:27] now come."
[1:11:31] Remember the prophet says
[1:11:33] this was after crossing Jordan.
[1:11:39] As I'm preaching, I pray that you pray
[1:11:41] with me.
[1:11:44] You know, getting an inspiration also to
[1:11:46] bring it out.
[1:11:50] And my aim is our hearts to burn within
[1:11:52] us after.
[1:11:57] Hallelujah. Amen. So the prophet say
[1:12:01] that this was after the crossing of
[1:12:02] Jordan.
[1:12:06] Remember the crossing of Jordan was the
[1:12:08] breaking of the seven seals.
[1:12:13] And then the Bible says
[1:12:16] that
[1:12:18] signs and wonders in the world.
[1:12:22] You know this and that
[1:12:25] bread
[1:12:27] which types miracles
[1:12:31] the the first pool and the second pool.
[1:12:35] But now the prophet says
[1:12:38] that this pillar of fire
[1:12:42] turned into a man
[1:12:45] and it it put on flesh.
[1:12:49] It ceased to be the pillar of fire
[1:12:53] that they were looking for.
[1:12:56] I believe maybe Joshua was standing
[1:12:57] there looking whether I can see the
[1:12:59] pillar of fire.
[1:13:03] But he saw a man with a sword
[1:13:06] and he asked him, "Are you for us?"
[1:13:09] Hallelujah.
[1:13:10] And who was that?
[1:13:13] We see also the prophet saw.
[1:13:17] He received that very sword.
[1:13:21] And then he said, "What's this for?"
[1:13:24] He said, "This is the sword of the king,
[1:13:28] the word of God."
[1:13:31] Hallelujah. Amen. So, and then we see
[1:13:36] that now what about these people who say
[1:13:39] uh
[1:13:40] the pillow fire has appeared, you know,
[1:13:43] they take photos, they post everywhere.
[1:13:49] You see, we we no longer look at the
[1:13:53] pillar of fire,
[1:13:56] but we look at the person of Christ
[1:14:01] who was embodied into the prophet
[1:14:03] himself.
[1:14:06] Brother Brham
[1:14:08] and then brother Brham himself,
[1:14:12] he became the first fruit
[1:14:17] of his ministry.
[1:14:20] and then
[1:14:22] to the church.
[1:14:26] Hallelujah.
[1:14:28] So we see that these people they were
[1:14:31] told to shout
[1:14:34] but they were not told what to shout.
[1:14:39] And then when the prophet was preaching
[1:14:41] the seventh seal,
[1:14:44] he said that I saw it clearly.
[1:14:49] First of all, he said that it was uh
[1:14:53] revealed in three-fold manner.
[1:14:59] And he said one was yesterday.
[1:15:02] One today
[1:15:06] and another one I saw it clearly
[1:15:11] but it was in an unknown language.
[1:15:16] Hallelujah. Amen. So we see but we he
[1:15:19] said but it is the third book
[1:15:23] you see. So it it first of all it's
[1:15:26] unknown
[1:15:29] in unknown language.
[1:15:32] Okay. But we see that it is connected to
[1:15:35] the bride
[1:15:38] because John said there was no man
[1:15:40] worthy.
[1:15:44] So it is to do with the man just
[1:15:45] specifically man
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:48] and we see that that's the min the
[1:15:50] mystery
[1:15:55] and and then the prophet said that this
[1:15:57] man
[1:15:58] was standing before Joshua.
[1:16:02] He had power.
[1:16:04] He could just carry those walls of
[1:16:06] Jericho.
[1:16:09] Maybe sweep them with the waters from
[1:16:11] the Red Sea.
[1:16:14] But wait,
[1:16:17] there is a part for the bride
[1:16:21] and that is the unknown language.
[1:16:24] Hallelujah. There is a part that the
[1:16:26] bride has play
[1:16:29] the third fold
[1:16:32] for the bride.
[1:16:35] The angel could just wipe it in a
[1:16:37] minute.
[1:16:42] And then the prophet said that say that
[1:16:44] the pillar of fire now was Christ in us.
[1:16:50] see that when they crossed Jordan,
[1:16:53] this pillar of fire
[1:16:55] became a man
[1:17:00] with a sword.
[1:17:02] And then maybe for another time, I may
[1:17:06] not go there,
[1:17:09] but we see that it's this man that gave
[1:17:11] them the instructions
[1:17:16] of how to bring down the walls of
[1:17:18] Jericho.
[1:17:21] what fall and so on.
[1:17:23] Now we see we know that in the book of
[1:17:27] Thessalonians says that
[1:17:31] God himself shall descend
[1:17:35] with a shout voice of the trump.
[1:17:40] Hallelujah.
[1:17:44] Meaning
[1:17:46] he is coming
[1:17:48] from the seventh dimension
[1:17:53] to
[1:17:55] light matter time
[1:18:00] and that's why it's called a mystery.
[1:18:03] Hallelujah. Amen. The prophet said
[1:18:05] heaven and earth embracing
[1:18:10] and last time I told that that's the
[1:18:12] ministry of the bride
[1:18:17] is to bring heaven on earth
[1:18:21] to bring heaven on earth.
[1:18:24] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:18:27] And now we see
[1:18:29] that the voice this voice
[1:18:32] it is the voice of the archangel.
[1:18:35] You know there's a Pentecostal preacher
[1:18:37] I was preaching to
[1:18:41] and then finally was saying
[1:18:43] that the angel shall stand in the clouds
[1:18:47] and then the trumpet
[1:18:50] and then the he first shout
[1:18:53] and then after shouting
[1:18:56] then the voice
[1:18:59] and then the trumpet shall start
[1:19:02] and then heaven.
[1:19:04] You see
[1:19:06] now we see that this voice of the
[1:19:07] archangel
[1:19:11] guess what
[1:19:14] it is the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:19] Hallelujah
[1:19:21] is the bread coming of Christ.
[1:19:26] You see,
[1:19:28] I believe I put here this quote here.
[1:19:29] They say that
[1:19:31] and in an exposition of the seven church
[1:19:35] age,
[1:19:38] the loudesian church
[1:19:41] say that until in this last day
[1:19:45] is again another people in the land
[1:19:49] who under their messenger
[1:19:53] will be the the final voice, the final
[1:19:56] edge.
[1:19:59] Sir, the church is no longer the
[1:20:01] mouthpiece of God.
[1:20:05] It is its own mouthpiece.
[1:20:09] So God is turning on her.
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:15] He will confound in her.
[1:20:18] He will confound her through the prophet
[1:20:21] and the bride.
[1:20:24] for the voice of God
[1:20:28] of the archangel
[1:20:31] will be in her.
[1:20:34] So today we are talking about the voice
[1:20:38] and I will tell you why we have sung
[1:20:39] that song I surrender.
[1:20:44] Hallelujah. We going to pick just a few
[1:20:45] characters in the Bible if time allows
[1:20:47] like three
[1:20:51] and then we'll be done.
[1:20:53] Let's look at Esther.
[1:21:00] Do you believe that this great mystery
[1:21:02] of God?
[1:21:06] Because the prophecy that it was uh not
[1:21:09] for public, it was like as if it was not
[1:21:14] uh broken or interpreted.
[1:21:21] But he said that it is typed throughout
[1:21:23] the the Bible.
[1:21:29] It is typed in the shadow.
[1:21:34] So it means that we can be able to see
[1:21:36] it clearly.
[1:21:40] But he left it for the bread. There is a
[1:21:42] part for us.
[1:21:46] How can we see it?
[1:21:48] You remember the two brothers that were
[1:21:50] walking to a mouse.
[1:21:53] First of all,
[1:21:56] they were a bit confused.
[1:21:59] They were lacking some revelation.
[1:22:02] They knew Jesus,
[1:22:04] but they walked with him without
[1:22:07] realizing that he's the one
[1:22:11] because I believe he appeared to them in
[1:22:12] another form.
[1:22:16] in another form like how he has appeared
[1:22:17] to us.
[1:22:20] You see, but what happened?
[1:22:24] It took God
[1:22:26] to take them through the types and
[1:22:28] shadows
[1:22:33] through from Moses
[1:22:36] throughout
[1:22:41] their eyes open
[1:22:44] and they knew him.
[1:22:46] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:50] Now we see that Esther
[1:22:53] by tribulation
[1:22:58] she was able to go to the palace.
[1:23:05] You know the king had first sent his
[1:23:07] soldiers
[1:23:10] to come and hunt for them
[1:23:13] which seemed to be tribulation.
[1:23:19] And you see but you have to remember
[1:23:23] that there was a prophet
[1:23:25] and that was
[1:23:29] he gave her the words of wisdom
[1:23:32] and she kept them. The Bible says
[1:23:36] if she didn't keep them,
[1:23:39] she would have not been able to reach
[1:23:44] preach where she wherever she reached.
[1:23:48] And now we see one time
[1:23:51] as she was there
[1:23:55] then through
[1:23:58] told her come on Esther
[1:24:01] you have relaxed enough.
[1:24:05] Now we are coming now to our topic of
[1:24:07] today.
[1:24:10] You have relaxed enough.
[1:24:13] You have enjoyed enough of the first P
[1:24:16] and the second P.
[1:24:20] Do you believe
[1:24:22] that the seals are throughout the Bible?
[1:24:27] Hallelujah. Believe.
[1:24:30] So he told her,
[1:24:34] "You've got to face the king."
[1:24:40] She had to speak out.
[1:24:43] Remember the voice of the archangel is
[1:24:45] within her.
[1:24:49] But now remember saints,
[1:24:53] it is this voice that is connected to
[1:24:56] the resurrection of the dead.
[1:25:00] It is this voice that is connected to
[1:25:01] the rapture.
[1:25:04] That's why brother Gary last time he
[1:25:06] said
[1:25:08] that you are the rapture.
[1:25:11] Simply he was meaning you are the voice.
[1:25:14] You are that voice.
[1:25:17] Okay. Amen. But now the reason why we we
[1:25:21] may God give us grace.
[1:25:24] Most times we think that the dead are
[1:25:26] waiting for us.
[1:25:29] I mean we think we are waiting for them.
[1:25:32] But every God is waiting for us.
[1:25:36] The dead are waiting for us because we
[1:25:39] are the voice
[1:25:42] and he has he has entrusted us.
[1:25:47] Hallelujah. So we are the one to bring
[1:25:50] the rapture
[1:25:52] and we are to bring the dead.
[1:25:56] Hallelujah. So we see that told her
[1:25:58] Esther come on
[1:26:01] come on
[1:26:03] enough
[1:26:05] of your comfort in the palace.
[1:26:10] Hallelujah. Amen. And now
[1:26:15] the Bible says that say that Esther had
[1:26:17] to make a decision. You see it takes us
[1:26:19] back to the decision making.
[1:26:25] She said
[1:26:27] that if I die, I die.
[1:26:31] She made that uh decision.
[1:26:36] And then she she said that I will go to
[1:26:40] the king.
[1:26:42] But before she went,
[1:26:45] she had first pray
[1:26:47] first prepare herself.
[1:26:50] We shall come to that also.
[1:26:53] And now she had to face the king
[1:26:57] and speak. And now here the secret is
[1:27:02] of all the people in the palace that
[1:27:04] didn't know.
[1:27:08] It was the voice of the king
[1:27:11] in her speaking to the king
[1:27:16] because everyone was like what?
[1:27:20] And now you see that the Bible says
[1:27:23] Now before now Esther approached there
[1:27:28] it was 30 days of silence
[1:27:33] of silence. Nothing is happening in the
[1:27:34] court.
[1:27:37] Now that silence
[1:27:41] it needed Esther to break it
[1:27:45] tap into that silence.
[1:27:49] And then we see Esther coming down the
[1:27:51] aisle.
[1:27:54] She approached the king.
[1:27:57] And now what is amazing here,
[1:28:02] the king as if the king was waiting for
[1:28:04] her.
[1:28:08] You see if if you look at the response
[1:28:11] of the king
[1:28:15] my queen
[1:28:17] what's th petitional
[1:28:23] she say that you and honey
[1:28:26] if it pleases the king
[1:28:30] come to the banquet
[1:28:33] because now the bride
[1:28:36] has to bring the enemy
[1:28:40] and the Lord
[1:28:43] at the same table.
[1:28:45] You see, and now we see here
[1:28:49] that it had to take a decision for her.
[1:28:55] And then here it say that then said the
[1:28:57] king unto her,
[1:28:59] thou queen Esther,
[1:29:03] and what is thy request?
[1:29:06] It shall be
[1:29:08] even it shall be even given thee to the
[1:29:12] half of the kingdom.
[1:29:17] Something that has never been said
[1:29:19] before by
[1:29:22] the prophet say that this it means
[1:29:25] equality.
[1:29:30] It means God in the bride.
[1:29:34] It means that the bride is equal to God.
[1:29:40] You see, and then in the message uh
[1:29:43] Christ the mystery of God revealed
[1:29:47] this is God's great mystery of love
[1:29:49] expressed
[1:29:53] that God and man became one.
[1:29:58] See equality
[1:30:01] the whole thing is God and man.
[1:30:05] One.
[1:30:07] God and man was one there
[1:30:10] and God and man is one here now.
[1:30:14] Hallelujah. Is that wonderful?
[1:30:17] And then we see that the bride has got
[1:30:20] to speak out.
[1:30:24] This voice had have to come out.
[1:30:28] But now this voice come out. The prophet
[1:30:29] says that the rapture
[1:30:32] will take a fully surrendered heart
[1:30:40] surrendering everything
[1:30:44] including the worldly pleasures
[1:30:48] all forsaken.
[1:30:51] You can even forsake your comfort.
[1:30:55] Instead of feisting on your four
[1:30:57] millions
[1:30:58] salary,
[1:31:02] you decide to pick like two young
[1:31:05] families,
[1:31:07] people who have just gotten married,
[1:31:12] you follow them up that my brother, how
[1:31:13] are you doing?
[1:31:16] God has given me a revelation. I will
[1:31:18] always give you 500 every month.
[1:31:21] until you stabilize
[1:31:24] and then there is church land
[1:31:28] always one million let me tell you it is
[1:31:30] possible two millions and it's enough
[1:31:36] then you sacrifice the two millions
[1:31:39] you see let me tell you rapture it is
[1:31:41] not an easy thing
[1:31:45] it will take a fully surrendered heart
[1:31:50] you Esther had to say that if I die I
[1:31:52] die
[1:31:55] but let me leave my comfort.
[1:31:59] And now remember all the people
[1:32:03] people are depending on her
[1:32:08] for their life.
[1:32:11] So she had to speak out.
[1:32:14] This voice had to come.
[1:32:17] Hallelujah. Save the people.
[1:32:21] Hallelujah. Now the bride has has to
[1:32:24] speak. This voice has to come out
[1:32:28] even for the dead for the dead to be
[1:32:30] quickened.
[1:32:33] Hallelujah.
[1:32:35] And now we see another
[1:32:37] uh little lady that had to speak
[1:32:42] something that has never happened in
[1:32:44] history.
[1:32:46] You know the eastern culture and the old
[1:32:48] testament
[1:32:53] they could not regard any words of the
[1:32:56] little lady.
[1:32:59] They had no say.
[1:33:02] They make for them decisions.
[1:33:06] But this time around it was a mystery.
[1:33:11] Rebecca, Rebecca. And
[1:33:14] you see
[1:33:17] Elza,
[1:33:19] we all know that he types the prophet
[1:33:22] or prophet
[1:33:24] who went forth to look for the bride.
[1:33:29] And here he comes.
[1:33:32] But remember go uh his master Abraham
[1:33:38] he has told him
[1:33:40] that the angel God will send his angel
[1:33:46] the angel will be with you
[1:33:49] and it is true the angel was with him
[1:33:53] and everything that he prayed to God
[1:33:56] answered
[1:33:59] and I want us to watch just a few
[1:34:01] moments from this little lady here,
[1:34:05] she came down
[1:34:08] and uh the prophet or the man of God
[1:34:11] just said just one word
[1:34:16] just water to drink.
[1:34:20] She did hesitate.
[1:34:22] I want you to look at her heart. She
[1:34:24] gave him immediately
[1:34:26] and said I can even feed you a camel.
[1:34:28] Now the prophet says that that act it is
[1:34:32] recognizing the prophet
[1:34:37] and then recognizing his ministry
[1:34:42] because you can be a message believer
[1:34:44] but when we have not recognized the
[1:34:46] ministry
[1:34:49] or the message
[1:34:52] but this lady recognized both.
[1:34:56] Hallelujah. And now quick she ran
[1:35:00] and now this man told her told her
[1:35:05] I've come for the wife
[1:35:07] I want to take you
[1:35:09] to be my master's son.
[1:35:13] You see
[1:35:15] and now quickly she ran home
[1:35:20] pack my things and go.
[1:35:24] But these people they asked
[1:35:28] And I I will read it here
[1:35:31] say that and they said we will call the
[1:35:35] dam
[1:35:37] and inquire at her mouth
[1:35:42] for the first time. It has never
[1:35:43] happened.
[1:35:47] And now the prophet say that her act of
[1:35:51] feeding the camels,
[1:35:55] watering them and the servant of God,
[1:36:00] it was an unspoken language.
[1:36:05] The language that the prophet saw
[1:36:09] and he could not interpret.
[1:36:12] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:36:14] Now
[1:36:17] here he comes.
[1:36:20] And now these people
[1:36:22] they told her, "Okay, you can go
[1:36:27] but you stay here long a little bit
[1:36:29] longer.
[1:36:32] You see remember that condition of
[1:36:38] you you are not
[1:36:40] too too convinced to believe it with all
[1:36:43] your heart
[1:36:46] and you don't have power within you to
[1:36:48] reject.
[1:36:51] So you are just there
[1:36:54] t here for 10 days
[1:36:58] 10 days
[1:37:01] in the laws of Moses.
[1:37:04] Hallelujah.
[1:37:06] But what did you see under the third
[1:37:08] when it comes under the third
[1:37:12] he say that let let the damsel speak.
[1:37:21] Let the maiden speak.
[1:37:25] This voice has to come out.
[1:37:28] And then what did she say? The Bible
[1:37:30] says that she said I am going
[1:37:33] that I will go.
[1:37:36] I will go.
[1:37:39] And then the Bible say that away they
[1:37:41] went.
[1:37:45] And uh I'm going to read for you this
[1:37:48] quote here. Say that God's great mystery
[1:37:52] of how it's a secret.
[1:37:56] He kept it a secret.
[1:38:00] Nobody know nothing about it.
[1:38:04] Even the angels didn't understand it.
[1:38:08] You see,
[1:38:10] he didn't reveal it.
[1:38:13] That's the reason under our seventh
[1:38:16] mystery
[1:38:19] when the seventh seal
[1:38:22] was opened
[1:38:23] there was silence
[1:38:26] and I remember this silence it is the
[1:38:28] the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:38:32] step into it
[1:38:35] like how Esther stepped
[1:38:38] in those 30 days of sale.
[1:38:41] Hallelujah.
[1:38:44] And now we see here
[1:38:47] again also in the book of Esther chapter
[1:38:48] 10
[1:38:52] say that now the king laid tribute
[1:39:00] laid tribute.
[1:39:04] Okay. He laid a tribute on land and on
[1:39:07] the sea.
[1:39:17] It is
[1:39:20] like something
[1:39:27] is that the word. Okay. He lied to on
[1:39:30] land and on the sea.
[1:39:35] You remember revelation 10
[1:39:38] this night when he came
[1:39:42] with an open book.
[1:39:45] He placed his one leg on the land
[1:39:49] and another one on the sea.
[1:39:52] the prophecy that he was suppressing
[1:39:53] every evil spirit
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:39:59] that will hinder the message of Elijah
[1:40:04] to reach the bride.
[1:40:07] You see, we have no excuse.
[1:40:11] We have no excuse completely.
[1:40:14] There is only one thing that God
[1:40:15] requires us to do.
[1:40:18] It is to make that one decision
[1:40:23] and reach at a point of total surrender.
[1:40:28] We completely give ourselves
[1:40:35] there is a someone I was talking to
[1:40:36] yesterday
[1:40:40] and and she say that uh you know for us
[1:40:45] we would want to come for Wednesday
[1:40:47] service and somehow we don't
[1:40:53] manage but this is what I told her that
[1:40:55] I believe
[1:40:58] as long as we are trying our best.
[1:41:01] I believe God is not going to take an
[1:41:03] imperfect bride.
[1:41:07] There has to come at least a time for
[1:41:09] you
[1:41:12] to be perfect.
[1:41:14] That's what I was praying that God gives
[1:41:15] us grace.
[1:41:17] We be able to surrender everything.
[1:41:22] We surrender everything.
[1:41:26] and and let that voice of the archangel
[1:41:28] inside come out
[1:41:33] and away we go. And now I'm coming to my
[1:41:36] conclusion here.
[1:41:39] Uh you you remember can you believe it
[1:41:44] that the whole New Testament and Old
[1:41:47] Testament mystery,
[1:41:53] it was hinged on that little lady
[1:41:58] of Matthew chapter 2.
[1:42:04] She came to Christ.
[1:42:06] And now you see the prophet says,
[1:42:10] he says that the way he came
[1:42:16] Jesus coming and Jesus going is the same
[1:42:18] thing.
[1:42:23] But now the way he came at first
[1:42:27] he laid a pattern.
[1:42:31] He placed pattern.
[1:42:34] And then it is the same thing,
[1:42:38] the same pattern
[1:42:41] that the the braid going of Christ.
[1:42:48] Hallelujah.
[1:42:50] Now I want to tell you something small
[1:42:53] about this this little lady.
[1:42:57] She was speaking.
[1:42:59] She had to speak, but she never uttered
[1:43:02] words.
[1:43:05] It was
[1:43:07] unspoken
[1:43:09] language.
[1:43:12] Hallelujah. Amen. Whatever she was
[1:43:14] doing, she was speaking.
[1:43:17] It was the voice of the archangel
[1:43:21] in her
[1:43:23] because now
[1:43:25] she was the climax
[1:43:28] of the going of Christ.
[1:43:32] She she was the claimax. She's not that
[1:43:34] climaxed.
[1:43:38] Yes. So we see that it was because of
[1:43:41] her act.
[1:43:45] She was in It was her act
[1:43:49] that triggered all sleeping demons.
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:56] No, it was her act
[1:43:59] that triggered.
[1:44:04] Okay, it's fine. That triggered all the
[1:44:07] sleeping demons.
[1:44:10] Yes, exactly. And these demons
[1:44:15] were sleeping in Judas
[1:44:18] and they were everywhere.
[1:44:20] And away he ran
[1:44:23] and immediately
[1:44:25] they came and took him.
[1:44:29] But the whole mystery
[1:44:32] was connected this little lady.
[1:44:36] But she had to speak out
[1:44:38] an unknown language
[1:44:42] that even the disciples were like,
[1:44:44] "What's this?"
[1:44:47] And this
[1:44:49] and this is the same thing that is going
[1:44:51] to happen.
[1:44:55] It must happen.
[1:44:58] And this time around is the going away
[1:45:01] of Jesus
[1:45:03] the bride.
[1:45:06] Hallelujah. The bride has to speak out.
[1:45:12] And now there's another thing that I
[1:45:13] want you to see that she was in charge
[1:45:15] of the last event,
[1:45:23] the going out of Christ.
[1:45:26] She was in charge of the last evil.
[1:45:31] And now you see
[1:45:34] who is this lady
[1:45:38] is the bread of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:42] And now the prophet says
[1:45:44] that this expensive oil that she had.
[1:45:51] That's all that she had.
[1:45:56] And she surrendered everything.
[1:45:59] She surrendered everything to Christ.
[1:46:03] She said, "I surrender everything.
[1:46:06] All the worldly pleasures."
[1:46:10] Guess what will happen?
[1:46:12] If the bride comes to full maturity
[1:46:18] and make that decision,
[1:46:21] we shall go home.
[1:46:24] As simple as that.
[1:46:26] You see, because now it will resurrect
[1:46:30] all the sleeping demons
[1:46:34] to an extent
[1:46:37] that God can no longer let us live here
[1:46:43] and we have to take a flight.
[1:46:46] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:46:49] And now she was in charge of the last
[1:46:52] events.
[1:46:55] Guess what?
[1:46:58] You are in charge of everything.
[1:47:04] I didn't make a mistake. You are in
[1:47:06] charge.
[1:47:09] You may say, "I thought God,
[1:47:13] yes, it's God."
[1:47:17] Hallelujah. But remember, he is in the
[1:47:19] bride,
[1:47:21] the archangel.
[1:47:24] He's in the bride.
[1:47:27] And it is the greatest mystery
[1:47:31] that perhaps the demons they can't
[1:47:33] understand.
[1:47:36] That perturbs the Judas
[1:47:40] that perturbs everything
[1:47:43] you see. But we are in control.
[1:47:49] We are in control in charge of social
[1:47:51] media.
[1:47:55] headline of the news everything
[1:47:58] because it's all about the last events
[1:48:03] with a climaxing.
[1:48:07] See the headline comes that Trump has
[1:48:09] been selected as a president
[1:48:15] is a president.
[1:48:18] this and this Russia,
[1:48:21] Ukraine war,
[1:48:23] Iran, Israel,
[1:48:26] the whole mystery,
[1:48:29] it is hinged on the little bride of
[1:48:31] Jesus Christ.
[1:48:36] She is controlling the last event,
[1:48:40] but the world doesn't know.
[1:48:43] But we are the one behind YouTube,
[1:48:45] everything controlling
[1:48:50] You see, and that's how precious the
[1:48:51] bride of Jesus Christ is.
[1:48:54] You see, I say that the decision she
[1:48:57] made
[1:49:00] to surrender all she had she had
[1:49:04] triggered all the demons to speed the
[1:49:07] bride coming of Christ.
[1:49:16] Hallelujah.
[1:49:19] First of all,
[1:49:21] we have got to leave behind completely.
[1:49:26] And after leaving behind
[1:49:30] under the anointing of an ego,
[1:49:35] then remember it's not just the ego.
[1:49:38] We have to go further.
[1:49:43] The Bible says four living creatures.
[1:49:48] How about if I say five living
[1:49:50] creatures?
[1:49:52] Because now the prophet says
[1:49:56] that the ego
[1:49:59] has to give way for the lamb himself.
[1:50:06] Hallelujah. Of course when I talk about
[1:50:08] the ego
[1:50:10] I mean the Holy Spirit
[1:50:13] only that the Holy Spirit was coming in
[1:50:16] uh different manifestation
[1:50:20] and anointings
[1:50:24] and now we see in our age the anointing
[1:50:25] we are having is the anointing of ego.
[1:50:31] Yes. So we've got to come up here,
[1:50:36] live
[1:50:38] completely, separate ourselves from the
[1:50:40] dimension of hell
[1:50:44] and we bring heaven on earth.
[1:50:48] We unite the light matter time with
[1:50:50] seventh dimension.
[1:50:57] It does not stop there. Remember the
[1:51:00] lamb himself,
[1:51:03] he has to speak through the bride,
[1:51:06] the unknown language.
[1:51:09] And this is this is the last acts
[1:51:15] everything
[1:51:18] and then away we go
[1:51:21] and then everything is done.
[1:51:25] But now this evening I'm to tell you
[1:51:29] that the bride has got
[1:51:32] the
[1:51:34] the great work to do.
[1:51:39] We have a a ministry
[1:51:42] and that ministry.
[1:51:45] It is just to surrender everything to
[1:51:47] God.
[1:51:49] Everything.
[1:51:51] Look at anything that can come between
[1:51:53] you and Christ.
[1:51:58] surrender it completely.
[1:52:02] Anything remember I told you
[1:52:06] you being in position
[1:52:11] it is greater than anything before God.
[1:52:17] That job God can take it away.
[1:52:21] The wife God can take her.
[1:52:24] He can take the children.
[1:52:26] He can allow the devil torment you
[1:52:30] for you to be in the position.
[1:52:34] And the more you linger,
[1:52:39] the heavy the judgment seal,
[1:52:45] the judgment seal,
[1:52:49] you see. So, we've got make a decision
[1:52:53] and leave our comfort zones
[1:52:57] and approach the king
[1:53:00] and we speak out.
[1:53:02] And now last time we were talking with
[1:53:04] brother Polycap
[1:53:07] and now we're saying that now you see
[1:53:10] the prophet
[1:53:12] he had the most complicated job to do
[1:53:18] because now he had to reveal the seals
[1:53:23] but in a way
[1:53:25] that the devil won't get it.
[1:53:31] the demons will not get it
[1:53:35] and he has to bring it in a way that the
[1:53:36] bride will catch the revelation
[1:53:42] and that's why you see he was not
[1:53:43] straight forward.
[1:53:47] He was never straight.
[1:53:49] He goes here and there and there
[1:53:52] he's on seventh seal
[1:53:56] brings the sixth.
[1:53:59] He goes all the place
[1:54:03] and he could keep saying that I believe
[1:54:06] you get it.
[1:54:10] The reason why he didn't bring it plain
[1:54:12] plainly.
[1:54:15] It's because God had already laid the
[1:54:18] pattern
[1:54:22] because it was hidden.
[1:54:25] first coming,
[1:54:27] the second coming also it is hidden
[1:54:29] still
[1:54:31] but revealed in a way that the bride
[1:54:33] will catch it.
[1:54:37] You see signs.
[1:54:39] So I pray that may the Lord give us
[1:54:41] grace
[1:54:44] and yesterday night
[1:54:47] I dreamt I was preaching
[1:54:50] but as I was preaching
[1:54:53] I was speaking to myself.
[1:54:57] I was preaching to myself,
[1:55:00] may God give us grace and we surrender
[1:55:02] everything that we have.
[1:55:07] Unless we do that,
[1:55:12] we shall not
[1:55:14] achieve what we are waiting for.
[1:55:18] In fact, we are waiting for ourselves.
[1:55:23] And now you may say now if I make a
[1:55:24] decision
[1:55:26] what about others
[1:55:30] you know revival starts with an
[1:55:31] individual
[1:55:35] just come to a place
[1:55:39] make a decision and wait and see.
[1:55:44] You see the fire can start with a sister
[1:55:45] here
[1:55:48] and goes over.
[1:55:50] I guarantee you that
[1:55:54] if you start the fire,
[1:55:56] it will not stop on you
[1:55:59] because how many wants to go to heaven
[1:56:03] because we have to go.
[1:56:05] Hallelujah.
[1:56:07] And the bride and the spirit they say
[1:56:09] come Lord.
[1:56:13] We are all waiting for him.
[1:56:16] Now as the musicians come,
[1:56:19] let me finish with this.
[1:56:21] You see, I talked about uh the
[1:56:24] dimension.
[1:56:28] And whenever anything bad happens,
[1:56:33] don't forget the solution that the Bible
[1:56:35] gives us.
[1:56:38] Always go to the knees.
[1:56:42] and pray to God
[1:56:45] and God will give you strength
[1:56:48] to go through it.
[1:56:51] Remember
[1:56:53] the the Hebrew children
[1:57:00] there had to first be the judgment seal
[1:57:02] upon them
[1:57:06] which caused them to make a decision.
[1:57:10] And still they stood for God.
[1:57:14] And when they were thrown into that
[1:57:15] fire,
[1:57:17] they saw the seventh,
[1:57:21] they saw the son of man.
[1:57:25] Hallelujah. Amen. And here the secret is
[1:57:28] that in that furnace,
[1:57:32] nothing hurt them.
[1:57:35] So relax. Nothing is going to hurt you.
[1:57:39] Nothing is going to hurt your soul
[1:57:43] because the lamb is in control
[1:57:48] of everything.
[1:57:51] As the pastor comes, my brother, you can
[1:57:54] sing that song after after I've prayed
[1:57:56] this short prayer. May we pray? Oh, dear
[1:57:59] heavenly father, king of glory, we thank
[1:58:01] you for your mercy.
[1:58:03] Lord, I'm weak in the body,
[1:58:07] but Lord, you I thank you that you have
[1:58:09] used me
[1:58:12] to deliver something.
[1:58:14] Lord, I pray that may our hearts burn
[1:58:16] within us
[1:58:19] and may our hearts yearn for something
[1:58:23] that we ought to have.
[1:58:26] Lord, King of Father, may you come and
[1:58:28] speak to our hearts.
[1:58:31] May you help us. We make that decision.
[1:58:37] We surrender everything.
[1:58:39] We surrender everything unto you
[1:58:42] because we see that we are waiting on
[1:58:44] ourselves.
[1:58:47] The Lord is waiting on us
[1:58:51] and the sleeping saints are also waiting
[1:58:53] on us.
[1:58:56] Oh Lord, what a ministry.
[1:58:59] May you help us to fulfill it.
[1:59:02] In the might name of Lord Jesus.
[1:59:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:07] I surrender.
[1:59:10] I
[1:59:11] surrender.
[1:59:14] Oh.
[1:59:17] Ooh. I
[1:59:20] surrender.
[1:59:23] Oh.
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:28] Oh.
[1:59:30] To thee, my lied,
[1:59:37] [Music]
[1:59:38] I
[1:59:40] surrender.
[1:59:44] One more time. I surrender.
[1:59:48] I
[1:59:50] surrender.
[1:59:54] I surrender, Lord.
[1:59:58] I
[2:00:00] surrender
[2:00:04] [Music]
[2:00:05] your Lord
[2:00:09] to thee
[2:00:11] my praise
[2:00:19] surrender.
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:27] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. God bless
[2:00:31] you, saints.
[2:00:33] You know, there's that portion in the uh
[2:00:36] in the uh Laian church age.
[2:00:41] I think I don't I'm not too sure, but I
[2:00:42] think he read it.
[2:00:45] He's talking of the people
[2:00:48] under their messenger
[2:00:51] being the final voice
[2:00:54] to the final age.
[2:00:56] and that the church is no longer the
[2:00:59] mouthpiece of God.
[2:01:02] Now he's speaking of the the church
[2:01:04] church national the denomination
[2:01:09] is no longer the mouthpiece of God.
[2:01:13] It is its own mouthpiece.
[2:01:16] So God is turning on her.
[2:01:20] He will confound her through the prophet
[2:01:22] and the bride.
[2:01:27] For the voice of God will be in her, in
[2:01:31] the church, in the bride.
[2:01:36] You know, we know that the messenger's
[2:01:38] voice is the is the voice of God.
[2:01:42] But you see, it doesn't stop there.
[2:01:45] Revelation 10
[2:01:48] vers 7. Brother, if you give me that
[2:01:50] verse, it is speaking of the messenger,
[2:01:54] the prophet of our of our age
[2:01:57] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:02:00] angel. When he begins to sound, the
[2:02:03] mystery of God is finished. But then he
[2:02:06] doesn't stop there. Verses 8 to 11.
[2:02:11] Are you Are you following me? Is
[2:02:13] speaking of you,
[2:02:16] the bride, the church.
[2:02:19] You see this is about the angel
[2:02:22] vers seven we spoke on it on Sunday as
[2:02:24] well
[2:02:26] but then from vers 8 continue on all the
[2:02:29] way from to vers 11 I think.
[2:02:33] Yes. Come on brother give me the next
[2:02:36] verse.
[2:02:39] Thou must prophesy again
[2:02:42] before many peoples and nations and tong
[2:02:45] and kings. There is something that God
[2:02:49] is trying to do in our in our day
[2:02:52] to get us to realize what time we are
[2:02:54] living in.
[2:02:57] We are no longer in the church ages.
[2:03:00] We are being called out of there
[2:03:03] to a to a place where we take our place
[2:03:07] our position in Christ.
[2:03:10] Listen to this portion as before we we
[2:03:12] we give our offerings.
[2:03:16] It is the rising of the sun.
[2:03:20] All right? It says as Christ, now
[2:03:22] listen, as Christ was the first one to
[2:03:24] raise
[2:03:26] from all the prophets
[2:03:28] and so forth,
[2:03:31] although typed in many places.
[2:03:36] He was the first fruits of those that
[2:03:38] slept.
[2:03:44] He's
[2:03:50] now speaking of how Christ died in
[2:03:53] Christ. He was the first fruits of those
[2:03:54] that slept was the first and then he
[2:03:57] says in the bride coming of Christ
[2:04:03] coming out of the church.
[2:04:05] There will have to be a sheath waved
[2:04:09] again in the last days.
[2:04:16] waving of the sheath.
[2:04:21] What was the sheath?
[2:04:24] The first one that come to mature.
[2:04:30] The first one that proved it was a wit.
[2:04:36] That proved it was a sheath.
[2:04:41] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:04:44] Praise the name of the Lord. Well, when
[2:04:47] Jesus rose again from the dead,
[2:04:50] it was only to show there are many who
[2:04:54] will rise again from the dead.
[2:04:56] And in the first resurrection when Jesus
[2:04:58] rose from the dead, we see there are
[2:05:01] many who actually physically in reality
[2:05:03] rose from the dead
[2:05:06] and at that time and he saw them.
[2:05:11] You remember they were on the streets of
[2:05:13] Jerusalem.
[2:05:17] We see it says in this bright coming of
[2:05:19] Christ
[2:05:24] there is another shift
[2:05:27] that has to be waved
[2:05:29] to prove it was whe
[2:05:33] to prove this is real
[2:05:36] and he says hallelujah I am sure you see
[2:05:40] what I'm talking about
[2:05:43] it was waved over the people
[2:05:46] and the first time there will come forth
[2:05:50] for the bride age
[2:05:53] for a resurrection out of dark
[2:05:56] denominationalism.
[2:05:59] There will be a message
[2:06:02] [Music]
[2:06:04] that the full maturity of the word
[2:06:08] has turned back again
[2:06:11] in its full power,
[2:06:15] being waved over the people
[2:06:18] by the same signs
[2:06:21] and wonders that he did back there.
[2:06:26] Praise the name of the Lord. Because I
[2:06:28] live, ye live also.
[2:06:31] Speaking to his wife.
[2:06:35] Because you live. Because I live, ye
[2:06:38] live also.
[2:06:40] What a resurrection that that was.
[2:06:43] And what a resurrection this is.
[2:06:47] To be quickened from the dead,
[2:06:50] to be made alive in Christ Jesus.
[2:06:53] By God's quickening power,
[2:06:57] he was waved to them.
[2:07:00] The word
[2:07:02] which he was was waved back to them on
[2:07:05] the day of Pentecost.
[2:07:09] The word made manifest.
[2:07:16] Yeah. The word made manifest.
[2:07:20] You know after brother Bham preached
[2:07:21] everything,
[2:07:23] he also manifested what he was talking
[2:07:26] about.
[2:07:28] And you know uh when he spoke the
[2:07:32] squirre into existence
[2:07:35] speaking it into existence.
[2:07:38] What voice was that?
[2:07:40] It was the voice of God
[2:07:43] in a man in our day in this bread coming
[2:07:47] of Christ.
[2:07:50] And then a fish dead
[2:07:53] speaks back life to me.
[2:07:55] God proving I'm I'm again here
[2:08:00] to prove that there is another group
[2:08:04] that is going to do exactly this.
[2:08:07] But you see he brother Bham was waved in
[2:08:10] this bright coming of Christ
[2:08:13] to show there are many more
[2:08:17] that are going to rise
[2:08:19] in the end time
[2:08:22] and will do the same thing.
[2:08:26] And you know the voice that cried to
[2:08:29] John, come up hither
[2:08:33] calling him out
[2:08:36] of the church ages
[2:08:38] pointing to the rapture.
[2:08:41] You know, as we know that there's a
[2:08:43] three-fold uh uh
[2:08:46] process
[2:08:51] shout.
[2:08:53] That is the message that comes through
[2:08:56] the seventh angel message
[2:09:00] voice
[2:09:02] that's going on now.
[2:09:05] How many are getting it? That's going on
[2:09:08] now.
[2:09:10] I want to say we are being called out
[2:09:14] to come from denominations
[2:09:17] to come to maturity
[2:09:21] and there is no way that is going to
[2:09:22] happen
[2:09:24] if you are still so looped with what
[2:09:26] others are doing.
[2:09:29] Let us focus on this message friends.
[2:09:33] Um I want to encourage you to read the
[2:09:35] message
[2:09:37] to listen to the message. There is a lot
[2:09:40] of things there.
[2:09:43] day we were brother polycap and my
[2:09:45] daughter we were at over sister uh gets
[2:09:50] Monica was there and you know if you
[2:09:53] want to take a seat for a moment that's
[2:09:55] okay and as we were sharing there and
[2:10:00] talking yeah it's okay musicians you can
[2:10:01] continue a little bit and uh you know we
[2:10:04] we we we we were just each of us was
[2:10:06] sharing what they were feeding on
[2:10:09] and brother pulled out a message from
[2:10:11] desperations
[2:10:14] and and you know put out something from
[2:10:16] the church ages to the seals
[2:10:19] and and oh my we had a wonderful time.
[2:10:23] Let me tell you if you are a believer
[2:10:26] and you are eating the message and you
[2:10:28] meet one another and you have been
[2:10:30] feeding on the message you you cannot
[2:10:32] just talk flat.
[2:10:36] Something is happening in the spiritual
[2:10:38] realm.
[2:10:40] Even when you come to church and the
[2:10:43] message is preached and you've been
[2:10:45] feeding on it,
[2:10:47] then your heart gets quickened.
[2:10:50] Don't worry about the small small things
[2:10:51] disturbing you in this life.
[2:10:55] Let us feed on the word. The more you
[2:10:57] feed on the word, the more you become
[2:11:00] the word
[2:11:02] and the more you realize your place in
[2:11:04] Christ.

[2:11:41] to the message
[2:11:43] and then you realize something is being
[2:11:45] done in your life.
