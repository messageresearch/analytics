us now as we desire to hear from you grant it Lord in Jesus name amen [Music] amen amen amen I'd like you to go to scripture now we are also speaking to evening light bright Tabernacle even and so we are reading from The Book of Romans chapter 3 [Music] Romans chapter 3: 10 I'm hoping that you are just trying to find it in my Bible okay Romans 3: 10 everybody there if you're there say [Music] Amen so let us pray before we read Lord Jesus we are we have a portion of scripture here that we are going to read there many Souls Lord that no doubt need what we are going to talk about father I pray that you will take me out of the way consecrate me now I've waited on you and I expect you Lord that you will come and show up for I have nothing to say but only what your word says what you will put on our lips may you speak and may we be silent speak to us Lord let help us to open our hearts that we will all hear from you grant it Lord in Jesus name amen amen we are reading Romans 3: 10 as it is written there is none righteous no not [Music] one no I'd like us to take our seats for now and then we are going to continue reading from verse [Music] 21 and I pray that you give me your un divided attention tonight but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets so he begins by verse 10 where he says there is none righteous [Music] no and then he says but the righteousness of God without the law is manifested so according to our own righteousness there is none righteous not one but the righteousness of God has been manifested now this is the righteousness of God without the law being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus J Christ unto all and upon them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ [Music] Jesus God has set forth to be approp appropiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to Clare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus so when I'm speaking to evening light we usually do an hour I don't want to just be fast and you so I want you to prepare your mind and move with me and uh keep your thoughts together and even if you're streaming the service I'm sure that the Lord will minister to you and I have Labor to hear the mind to receive the mind of God for the service tonight convinced that uh I do not know how many but I'm convinced that this will be for someone tonight so I'm speaking on a subject false [Music] guilt false gu now we will try to rehearse a little bit of what we have read so we can get uh the the picture Romans 3 verse 10 says as it is written there is none righteous no not one but now the righteousness of God without the is manifested I want you to understand here is that no one is born righteous and no one that is born is righteous whether or not you have done something bad you may never have stolen told a lie or offended somebody but according to God according to the standard of God brother all of us are born sinful we actually born in sin the B so none is righteous tell your neighbor none is righteous tell your neighbor you are not righteous and you see if we to gaug on our own righteousness the scripture says that our righteousness is like Fe filthy rugs works of righteousness they are like filthy rugs before God and so there is nothing that you can ever do that will make you righteous before God that none of us is going to make it to Heaven because of our works of righteousness and so he emphasizes and he says there is none righteous no not one so whenever we talk about us believing in Holiness and believing in righteousness we are not really referring to our own Holiness and our own righteousness we are talking about his righte and this is what you need to attain in your life then he continues on and he says but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested now the righteousness of God comes without the law being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith right so the righteousness of God comes to you by faith in Jesus Christ Jesus by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe so the only thing you need to do to attain his righteousness is believing says for all have seen and come short of the glory of God but you see continues on by saying being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus Hallelujah we have been Justified freely amen by his grace through faith and he says whom God has set forth to be appropriation through faith in his blood to declare his righteous so why did he shed his blood please follow me closely here he shed his blood so that he will declare his righteousness for the remission of sin that are passed I'm speaking on false guilt now if I would want to Define guilt is the fact of having committed a specified or an implied offense or crime or a crime guilt is the reason of having violated a specific rule or law in other words if you break a law or if you break a rule either by your Society your community the laws of God the cultural laws whatever it is moral laws when you break those laws and then you you become guilty so guilt comes out of breaking a law now when we we cross a moral like I said a moral or eth then you become guilty guilt is primarily a state or a condition it is not a feeling I repeat it is not a feeling it is a state or condition someone can actually be guilty and not feel that they are guilty and they don't feel it they just killed someone and they don't feel the tell to me it's all right it's not bad according to them because they don't feel their guilty they think they're safe someone can go ahead and and fornicate and say I don't feel condemned I don't feel guilty because he does not know the law of God and so someone can actually be guilty and not feel that they are it is also possible not to be guilty and then feel you are guilty and and according to scripture we are all guilty before God because God gave his word which is his law in the Book of Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 I read and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou sh not eat of it for in in the day that thou eest thereof thou sh surely die so now we see here after man broke the word or the law of God so then he knew he was guilty because the law or the word of God was previously given to him so many times people will sin but they do not know they are sinners actually a sinner out there is a sinner but they don't actually know or realize they are sinners and they need God or they need salvation but they don't know it that is because they do not know the word and that's why we preach the word because the word brings condemnation and when you feel you are guilty that feel transports you into repentance so man because he knew he previously had known the word of God or the law of God the moment he did what God told him not to he knew he was guilty and this was the introduction of guilt actually the first time to the human race man also got guilt feelings and you know and then he hid himself and I want you to see now God started right from the beginning to for shadow justification Genesis 3: 21 and to Adam and also to his wife did the Lord God make CS of skin and clothed them in Hebrews 9:12 says neither by the blood of gods and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us after man had sinned a man came to a place of guilt he was not only in a place of guilt but he also had guilt feelings so then man needed Redemption needed salvation and so then what he did he hid himself that is what we all do when we sin before our away from the presence of God and this is what I want to deal with this evening actually many people when they they feel they guilty you see the devil brings them this sense of guilt that they do not need to be in the presence of God they are unworthy they don't even they shouldn't even come before God you know sometimes even feel like I shouldn't even pray I shouldn't even you know sing because my mouth is unclean my hands and clean my feet I feel like worship is not for me I can't even sing a special song I can't do anything for the this is how Adam felt and Adam shed the presence of God and together with his wife they hid themselves but I want you to I want to show you the attitude of God down he did not come with the attitude of judgment he only wanted one thing from Adam and Eve he only wanted him Adam to realize and confess his guilt you know God had introduced guilt or sin rather had introduced guilty to the human race you know sin introduce guilt into the human into the human race that God can use it as a policeman to bring this man back to God to bring him from sin back to God but I want to show you this evening devil TT the some something and he wants to use it to take man out of the presence of God guilt is not supposed to take us away from God's presence but it's supposed to take us into the presence of God Amen whereby Adam came and he he confessed he said yes I've done it God said have you eaten the fruit of the tree that I told you not to eat did God know or he did not know knew but why did he ask he wanted to hear Adam sayam had to say if you've done something and is condemning you you have to come before the presence of God and say that is called confession and some confessions are done in public others are done in private others are done to individuals others are done just before you and go if do not do that then that feeling will make you run away from the presence of God and so what was the attitude of God when God came down he did not begin judging Adam the moment Adam confessed his sin the moment Adam confesses God quickly went and killed a lamb and he brought CS of skins and closed them and in Hebrews 9 he says neither by the blood of God or the blood of but by his own blood now what listen Church what God did in the beginning was only foreshadowing what he would do later thousands of years later god listen why did God kill gods and Lambs why did he kill Gods God got to to remove the Skins he was just showing in the future I'm going to shed blood amen my own blood in order for you to be redeemed Adam as long as you have confessed your sin I'm going to redeem you my own blood because your blood is sinful your lineage is sinful but I am a perfect God I am Holy and I will have a holy generation that's why the Bible says I am Holy you holy as I am Holy now there he doesn't talk about your Holiness oh my I wish you would see this tonight he's talking about his holiness but he says be ye holy even as I am Holy he's not pointing to your Holiness he's not pointing to your righteousness he's pointing to his Holiness amen that's why he said by his own blood he entered him once into the holy place and having obtained Eternal Redemption for us Eternal Redemption if God ever redeemed anyone he redeemed them eternally he redeemed them to a point that he can never lose them again let me tell you if I've been redeemed once I've been redeemed forever if been saved was have been Saed forever oh praise the name of the Lord you know the act of shedding blood of animals and and and clothing Adam and Eve was just a shadow God showed what he would do to remove the guilt of sin whoever would receive the perfect sacrifice amen guilt would leave and guilt would leave them permanently and we are the beneficial of that in John 1:12 are I'm just trying to lay down some simple but very strong facts of our faith but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God and so when I hear that I hear that this way because I received him he gave me power to become a Son of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh not of the will of man but of God and and and you know the moment I was born again I ceas to be a son of my father things that were following my father's lineage were cut off that moment and then now the things that were following my new father's lineage amen I was joined to them for that moment and so what is my real lineage amen I come from God I go back to God I was not born of blood I was born I was not born of the wheel of the flesh I was not born of the wheel of my father but I was born of God Amen I was born according to a new convenant amen now I am joined onto a new blood his blood vein his blood amen flows through my veins why because I received him he gave me power to become his son so today I am a Son of God in John 3:16 he says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved why did he come to the world he did not come to show us how guilty we [Music] are because for sure we are guilty we guilty in our mind our conscience we are guilty in our body we are guilty in our words we speak but for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth so the only thing you have to do is to believe whosoever believeth Amen in him should not perish but have eternal life but for he says for God did not send his son to condemn Jesus did not come to condemn me amen but he came that I might be saved through him so in other words the message of the Cross or even the end time message as we call it not a message of condemnation it is a message of Salvation it is a message of hope it's a me it's a Guiltless message has come to Amen to declare to us that we are Guiltless amen we are no more guilty we are no more sinful we are redeemed we are saved now this is not what I said is what he said in his just follow me closely Romans 109 that if thou sh confess with thy mouth the Lord [Music] Jesus and Shall Believe in th heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved simple for with the heart man believe you may say I believe with your mouth that's not what we're talking about we are talking about the heart with the heart man believeth unto right and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture say whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed this goes for anything that you have done in your life amen if you believe in your heart having heard the word of God and you believe that Jesus Christ's blood washes away every sin after you repent of any sin the moment you you repent of it you must believe it in your heart and you must believe that him and his blood washes you per as though you never did it in the first place and after you confess it believe that you are washed away from believe that you are saved believe that you are clean so in other words it begins by hearing from hearing it comes to believing in the heart after believing in the heart then it comes to confessing the mouth so you said how many believe here that you are saved how did it start with your ears amen I'm saved you know when he were telling you preaching to you the gospel you accepted it you believed it and then you said what can I do and then they said you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you did it right away now you believe that you are saved and you tell your heart every day I am a believer I am saved I am a believer I'm saved and now you confess with your mouth not only in your heart you take it from your heart and you confess it I'm a believer I'm a Believer I am saved I'm a Believer you know you believe it and because you believe it the devil cannot rob it away from you in the same way if you have ever done something wrong did you know it works like magic it works even more than the moment he KNE before God and he said Lord I'm sorry for my that very moment the blood of Jesus washes your sins away that very moment you are cleansed and you are set free and you are no longer guilty according to God now he has already done everything to remove the guilt our only part is to believe him and to believe in his finished work now I want I want you to see here the difference between Godly guilt and World gift the book of second Corinthians 710 it says for go Godly sorrow work repentance to Salvation the word Sor there you can replace it for guilt to be repented of to Salvation not okay for Godly sorrow WTH repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world WTH death we are in 2 Corinthians 7: [Music] 10 can we give you a moment better be faster have a little time now I want to explain this and expound it for you tonight feelings are [Music] good when they lead you to repentance but the devil can also use these feelings to drive you away from Godly guilt has hopelessness hopelessness condemnation disappointment disillusionment you feel you disappointed in yourself you feel your hopeless some of you you look back and see the things you did and then you begin comparing yourself with others and you say me I'm I'm I'm so bad so bad I'm so bad but remember you repented of those things and those things are under the blood it is a sin for you to refer to those sins anymore because anything that is under the blood is not be remembered by God Amen the moment is confessed and repented and and so wildly guilt of the guilt of the world it shows you that you are bad and and nothing you can do to make you good enough it show you cannot be accepted even in your mind you say when you look at yourself you feel I'm so bad there is nothing good in me I've done only mistakes in my life sometimes you sit down in a corner and You Begin judging yourself oh I did this I did that I did this I did that can never redeemed am so bad I can no longer be good enough and you find a person that was really so good but because of this self condemnation because of this guilt that they apply upon themselves they can never break through complexes they would just be as if they're beaten by rain they long feel free to worship God they be as though they are bound you can literally look at a person and see that they have chains around them not chains placed there by [Music] God not placed by the world not even placed by the devil self applied chains and this is what I called false guilt it shows you you are bad and nothing you can do to make you good [Music] enough you know worldly sorrow or worldly guilt will make you have a bad attitude toward God it will make you feel that God is so big and God Is So holy and you are so bad and you and God can never forgive you even your prayers cannot be heard what are you praying now why are you even going to church quit going to church you are not so good you are not important you are sinful you know guilt will play with you and will begin to refer to things that you know you did and you also know you did and you tell you for example see this and this how can you even go and begin saying [Music] amen when you know you did this and this and that's why when you see people seated in church cold like ice they can't even thereare say one amen many times it's because of this false guilt theil is telling them you're not good enough God speaks to you you want to say amen and the devil tells you shut up you cannot say Amen because you a sinner because you are so bad amen is for the holy ones but I'm here to tell you that that is called false guilt that is not true guilt that's the devil trying to pervert Wordly sorrow or guilt clouds your head it clouds your head and gives you no way back to Redemption you feel you are enclosed you feel you are overcome by these thoughts of condemnation but that's not the way God works when God found Adam not tell him Adam you are sinful you are so bad trusted you I did this for you I you the whole world what have you done but what did he do the moment Adam confessed his roong God went to a to Redemption Redemption is the answer of Godly guilt praise the name of the Lord give for the unbeliever let me let's talk a little bit about the guilt for the unbeliever before God John 3 ver 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not so you see it's all about believing what do you believe what do you believe what do you believe right now do you believe you are saved do you believe your the Holy Ghost do you believe you're a child of God what do you believe do you believe you an overcomer do you believe you are walking out of that situation do you believe you are going to serve God do you believe you're going in the Rapture do you believe you're filled with the Holy Ghost you believe the blood of Jesus has been applied to you and all your sins are forgiven forgotten by God if you believe that then you will not condemned in other words you will not have guilt he that believeth not he that refuses to believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and love Darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil many times I've seen unbelieving friends you know they came to me and said pastor I want to believe but I'm sorry these things are so difficult for me I feel because when I believe I will not be able to keep up with your standards and you know let me tell you that's the devil speaking to because the Bible says all of us are guilty we are all born guilty we come to the world guilty but what makes us different come on brother what makes us different there's only one thing that makes us different that's believing we have believed the report we have believed his blood we have believed that he has washed and cleansed us we have believed we are more than conquer we are believed we are saved and the world is not our portion but they choose not to believe they choose to remain a sinner even when they guilty that guilt is supposed to drive them to God you see if you're not a beli you will experience feelings of guilt you should however let those feelings lead you to Jesus for Jesus absolves them these feelings for you are perfectly you know these feelings for you are perfectly meant to create in you a desire for [Music] forgiv [Music] Lord I'm not I'm not right with you instead of saying oh no how can I keep up with the standard listen friends we have no standards here our standard is Jesus Christ Hallelujah come on Church our standard is the word our standard is Jesus Christ Our standard is the blood of Jesus blood of Jesus has washed away every one of our sins and that is our standard amen and that blood can still atone for any of your sins can wash you clean no matter your desires no matter your no matter what you walked in before false guilt will tell you you know you know yourself you can't overcome that no I say you can overcome it first gu will tell you you know your level is here that is not your level let me tell you amen if you have received forgiveness Amen in one time in your life and you know God has forgiven me of my sins and I'm a Believer and I'm a Christian no matter what was in your past you drop it and walk away from it majestically as if it really never happened as if it really never happened the devil uses our past to to influence our present by telling us we cannot live better than our past but Jesus Christ amen comes and he tells us because of my blood amen I don't even remember your past and I'm here to give you a life an expected end when Jesus Christ comes he lifts us on a Higher Ground A Higher Ground whereby he says you are no longer down here on you are now in Heavenly places you are now in Heavenly places you are no longer down in you are now in Heavenly places I don't know where you are but I am in Heavenly places tell your neighbor I'm in Heavenly places this is where I am I am in Heavenly places where all things are possible where my sin is no longer remember where the Bible says they that are born of God canot sin that is the place where not sin can step that is the place where there is perfection that is the place where there is the bride Jesus Christ is coming back for a spotless bride a spotless bride how can we be spotless in ourselves we cannot but when he gives us his Holiness his Perfection we walk in a place of total perfection when he looks at us amen he looks through the blood and he sees Perfection Hallelujah you can praise him and say hallelujah glory to God Romans chapter 5 I'll show you what we are therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ justified by faith not by our works our works were already evil we were justified by faith because we believed we have been Justified how many believe tonight because you believe you've been Justified Hallelujah we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus that's why a Believer works with stoop shoulders you have peace with God you have peace in your heart you have no worry in your mind you have no condemnation in your mind you have no guilt over you you have peace with Jesus Christ Romans 81 says there is there are for now no condemnation tell your neighbor there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Oh Glory to God we don't walk according to the flesh our flesh has nothing good in it we are born with all these lust and the desires of the world and but let me tell you when we are in Christen the spirit of God puts our flesh under subjection of the power of the Holy Ghost to the extent we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh but we fulfill the amen the desire of the Holy Ghost in us and now the Bible says because you are in Christ amen there is no condemn because you are in Christ you have no condemnation no guil on you are gu this ought to make you shout make you say Glory Hallelujah because there is no condemnation hallelujah hallelujah if I'm the only one here who has no condemnation I'll shout it because I'm a free man in Christ amen someone will walk to you and say are you not the one who didc he said I'm sorry the address has changed the address has changed I am not the one you used to know I'm a different man I'm a different woman I am Guiltless are you not the one no I am not I am I'm a new man I'm a new creation glory to godallah praise God in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says you are standing completely Jus this is what I love more as though you never did it at the beginning all the bad stuff you think you've done and the devil has been using to condemn listen when you are Justified it means you never did it in the first place hallu this is my message to the church now and this is what our Prophet says his message is a message never did in the beginning if you're standing on God's word and with God's word and and with God's word every amen every J every tit where you are standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shars pull away from them shs you know many of us because you did certain things then now you begin to become friends with people who are still doing them they want to try to make you like as if you're one of them pull away from them sh get out here in the whe where you can get right before the son that's why we come in church that's why we Fellowship so we can ripen under the son of the [Music] son Hallelujah we are walking in the light I hear the amen the coming of the combine you are standing complete you are Justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah what about when we stumble and fall first John 1:9 if we confess our sins he is the is faithful and is just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteous it doesn't if you're in Christ all your sins are taken care of are you hearing me all everything is taken care of because if even if when you stumble and fall if you confess what you have done before him he has said he is faithful faithfulness mean you can count on him faithfulness means he's Dependable I've seen too many people feel guilty to the extent they lose their fire for God because of a little fult a little failure somewhere let me tell you brother sister if you're listening to me tonight leave your sins for the blood to cover be on fire for God don't let anything pull you down amen if you you stum and fall amen confess your sins he's faithful and he's just to give Amen to forgive our sins praise God cleans us from all unrighteous so that he can make us right so then what is false gu many Believers struggle with false guil and that's why we have believers who are not committed to service they are not committed to God fully because they're feeling guilty are you hearing me they're feeling guilty and when you feel guilty you cannot dedicate yourself to the service of God because then you're feeling unworthy they are forgiven and yet they still feel guilty they are burried in guilt guilt is all over them mind and heart even when you sleep you dream when you are uh you know going snakes are chasing after you because your conscience is not clean your conscience is filled with guilt even when you sleep you you are the one who will dream people chasing after you with my you always be wondering whether you being Beed or not because you are filled with guilt and I'm saying that is false guilt people they know that God has forgiven them but they cannot forgive themselves yeah I know they would even tell you I know I prayed that women confess know my sins are under the blood I know God has forgiven me but I can't forgive myself Des spite of their repentance they continue to beat themselves up and they actually think by doing that they are humble but you will actually see shortly that that is pride the devil speaks and he tells you you don't deserve full Pard you don't deserve full you a hypocrite you are a sinner youve done so many bad things you are so bad you don't God has has forgiven you but not completely God does not forgive halfway now let me tell you something else God when he forgives you of your sin he now even protects you from the after effects of he protects you from the hand of the div he protects you from your enemies we find many people they've done things and now they they've repented and now someone tells them if if if you you leave this I'm going to do this to you they begin blackmailing them and then they begin fear okay I know God has forgiven me but if I I I I if I don't do what this person is say I'm I'm finished you are not finished as long as you s you confessed and prop God will fight for you I actually believe and I'm convinced that this message is for someone or some people tonight work to I am not going to do what you're telling me to I am a child of God said no you did this no I did I am who I am and I know who I am you know the devil will speak to you God wants you to prove how sorry you are because you know you caused it you made it happen some of you even are guilty for things that have happened in other people's lives and you are so guilty someone dies and you I caused it to happen I cause it to happen I cause it to happen let me tell you you cause nothing to Happ every human being is a free moral agent and decisions they make they're responsible for them and if you made a decision to serve God and to confess the repent of your sins you are not responsible for them you are not guilty I am here to announce to you you are not guilty in the name of Jesus Christ you are not guilty you are not the devil will tell you you are not worthy of God's grace and therefore you must punish yourself until he become better you know the devil the devil leaves you know to many people to think that by actually hanging onto their sins they're being humble and I want to say that is actually pride humility accepts [Music] pardon pardon it can never ear and humility lives to demonstrate that gratefulness but if you refuse to be forgiven you are proud Pride thinks God may have forgiven you but your standard is make is is higher [Music] standard your standard actually is higher than God's God forgive you but you need to punish yourself what I did is so bad what I did so bad Pride makes you feel the sacrifice on the cross is sufficient to cover people's sins but not yours so we think we can actually help Jesus to pay for the Sacrifice by punishing ourselves you think you have to C your shame until you decide the sacrifice has been fully paid this is false guilt clinging to eat suggest that the blood of Jesus is not [Music] enough but I want to tell you tonight finish amen when Jesus forgave you and announced it by his word said you Justified you are Justified that means ific NF guilt let me even tell you he justified you before you were even born so you even knew the things you were going to do he even knew the bad things you're going to beol and he forgave you before you even repented and he wased you before you even conf and anybody that tells you you need to punish yourself you need to you know go through this process they are a liar because when God forgives you one time forgave you forever and that is false guilt don't let FAL guilt false guilt hinder you from serving [Music] God praise the name of the Lord I'll finish with this quot why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian Life and this is the reason why because of false guilt the prophet of God says take away all
