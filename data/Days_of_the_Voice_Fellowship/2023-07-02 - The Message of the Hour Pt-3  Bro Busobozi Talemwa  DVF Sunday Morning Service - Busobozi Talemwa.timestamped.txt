[1:10:36] are giving unto us exceeding great and
[1:10:39] precious promises that by this he might
[1:10:42] be partakers of the divine nature having

[1:13:51] you always in remembrance of these
[1:13:54] things though you know them and be
[1:13:57] established in the present truth
[1:13:59] is
[1:14:12] speaking on the subject
[1:14:15] the message of the hour
[1:14:21] what you could call the present truth
[1:14:27] I've been on this subject now two weeks
[1:14:33] but I know that Ministries are different
[1:14:38] many times when I want to teach
[1:14:41] something and laid out very well little
[1:14:42] by little I notice that I'm all over the
[1:14:45] place
[1:14:51] I mean like I'm Evangelistic
[1:14:55] and that's that's my gift that's how God
[1:14:57] made me change
[1:14:59] you can only power out what I have
[1:15:03] and I can only power out what you brave
[1:15:06] from ask from God
[1:15:11] pray for the ministry of the word
[1:15:15] when you come in the church you are a
[1:15:18] hundred percent sure that what you will
[1:15:20] hear is from the Lord
[1:15:25] foreign this morning I don't know how
[1:15:28] many have prayed minister to them
[1:15:33] but if you have prayed I want to
[1:15:36] encourage you God will minister to you
[1:15:40] have not prayed I want to encourage
[1:15:47] right now you can say a little prayer in
[1:15:49] your house
[1:15:51] oh Lord may you speak to me
[1:15:54] I want to hear from you and I'm sure
[1:15:57] that he will speak to you
[1:15:59] praise the name of the Lord so friends
[1:16:02] we are in a time
[1:16:04] when looking around and seeing
[1:16:06] everything going around us
[1:16:09] we can clearly see that the world is
[1:16:12] departing from God
[1:16:16] and the world is departing from God
[1:16:18] systematically
[1:16:22] especially the most one of the most or
[1:16:25] actually the most dangerous ages age of
[1:16:28] all ages
[1:16:35] and that is the age we actually happen
[1:16:37] to live here
[1:16:40] its name is
[1:16:48] those Church ages where some of them
[1:16:51] people did not actually believe in God
[1:16:56] other ages people really believed in God
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:06] and you know because the believer was
[1:17:09] ready to die for the truth
[1:17:13] I was not ready
[1:17:19] but you see in in the last age
[1:17:25] the Bible speaks of which in the Book of
[1:17:27] Revelation chapter 3.
[1:17:30] he has nothing nothing good to talk
[1:17:34] about the last age
[1:17:37] for if you can turn with me to the book
[1:17:40] of the Lord sorry to the Book of
[1:17:42] Revelation chapter three I'm thinking
[1:17:43] about Allah this year
[1:17:45] foreign and and I wanted to look at
[1:17:48] verse 14.
[1:17:50] of the Church of laodicean of the Lord's
[1:17:55] right these things says the amen the
[1:17:57] faithful and true witness the the
[1:18:00] beginning of the creation of God because
[1:18:16] and he says I Know Thy words are Thou
[1:18:19] Art neither cold nor hot I would that
[1:18:21] word called
[1:18:31] first of all the world is actually means
[1:18:34] people's rights
[1:18:38] so we are in an age or a generation of
[1:18:41] Rights
[1:18:44] whereby politically and according into
[1:18:47] our world Cosmos now people actually can
[1:18:50] do what they want to do and they have a
[1:18:52] right to do what they want to do because
[1:19:01] no one has a right to stop you from
[1:19:03] doing what you have a right to do
[1:19:07] you have a right to think that you are a
[1:19:09] cat or to think that you are a cow
[1:19:14] and everyone should respect your rights
[1:19:18] that age is now
[1:19:21] you might not see that kind of uh uh you
[1:19:25] know that kind of degradation actually
[1:19:27] here now or in Uganda
[1:19:33] it doesn't mean it is not in the world
[1:19:35] or in our age
[1:19:38] and really Hollywood feeds the rest of
[1:19:41] the world
[1:19:44] now these spirits come from there and go
[1:19:48] all over the world
[1:19:51] and the Bible says gross Darkness has
[1:19:54] covered the earth
[1:19:58] and the Bible here says that the people
[1:20:01] in laodicea they actually are not hot
[1:20:03] and they are not cold at the same time
[1:20:09] you know these are people who think that
[1:20:12] oh we are hot and oh we are called
[1:20:19] in other words when it comes to God and
[1:20:21] it comes to God this word they really
[1:20:23] want to profess that they are believers
[1:20:28] like in the Book of Romans chapter 1 it
[1:20:31] says that uh you know they say they
[1:20:33] believe the gospel
[1:20:37] but they deny the power of the gospel
[1:20:41] and so they are not actually outright it
[1:20:44] is saying we don't believe God
[1:20:48] quite frankly quite a few people who
[1:20:51] profess not to be Believers in God
[1:20:57] most people in this generation actually
[1:20:59] believe in God
[1:21:02] they said they believe in the existence
[1:21:04] of God
[1:21:06] they believe there is a God in heaven
[1:21:09] many of them will actually say they
[1:21:11] believe the Bible to be the truth
[1:21:15] actually even many of them say we are
[1:21:17] preaching the Bible
[1:21:19] read a Bible but here the Bible says
[1:21:22] they are not called and they are not hot
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:25] and God is saying I would at least if
[1:21:28] you were called
[1:21:34] so then because now at lukewarm and
[1:21:37] neither called the heart I will spill
[1:21:39] thee out of my mouth
[1:21:46] know how many of you have ever taken
[1:21:48] lukewarm water
[1:21:50] is
[1:21:53] not good
[1:21:55] for the fruit if you take lukewarm water
[1:21:59] you'll feel like throwing it out again
[1:22:04] is that right you would rather take cold
[1:22:07] or you'd rather take
[1:22:10] you know when someone gives you a
[1:22:13] bottled water
[1:22:15] when it is not hot and it's not cold
[1:22:19] you know you you when you take it it
[1:22:23] tastes kind of funny
[1:22:25] you would rather have very cold water or
[1:22:28] very hot water
[1:22:31] and God is saying the people in laodice
[1:22:40] and God is saying because of this
[1:22:43] I will actually spill thee I'll spit you
[1:22:46] out of my mouth
[1:23:45] of me God tried in the fire again
[1:23:51] that you may be rich
[1:23:56] you may be close by the shame of your
[1:23:59] nakedness do not appear it is
[1:24:07] that that you may see
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:19] this is the Council of God
[1:24:28] to buy that you may be rich buy clothes
[1:24:32] for me
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:38] God has a white roommates
[1:25:37] it is
[1:26:35] God does not change
[1:26:38] says is the same yesterday today and
[1:26:40] foreign
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:28:02] and this is what we have in the Holy
[1:28:04] Spirit foreign
[1:28:50] praise the name of the Lord
[1:28:51] praise the name of the Lord
[1:28:55] when you you look at Israel as the
[1:28:57] natural Church
[1:29:00] you know God's Called Moses
[1:29:03] a message
[1:29:08] and really I I I I I I will in the
[1:29:12] morning very early in the morning in the
[1:29:13] wee hours of the morning
[1:29:17] God spoke to me and
[1:29:21] um regarding this portion that I want to
[1:29:23] bring in could you tune into this
[1:29:25] subject
[1:29:28] the three exoduses
[1:29:43] was with Moses and so God spoke to Moses
[1:29:48] and he gave him the word and when God
[1:29:51] when when Moses had this word
[1:29:55] he called out the people
[1:29:57] to come out of a system come out of
[1:30:01] Egypt
[1:30:04] there was a promise
[1:30:08] where they were going to go there was a
[1:30:12] place where this message was going to
[1:30:16] take them out of
[1:31:16] foreign foreign
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:33:15] that's not the new Bible
[1:33:40] hallelujah hallelujah and mothers
[1:33:42] preached and mothers left the city
[1:33:45] before the word was fulfilled
[1:33:48] but God is
[1:33:50] always
[1:33:53] Generations
[1:34:02] when mothers left the sins
[1:34:10] Rangers
[1:34:23] was it the same God yes oh yes he was
[1:34:27] because
[1:34:44] the promise of God
[1:34:50] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen what is
[1:34:53] the purpose of God
[1:34:55] from Genesis to Revelations
[1:34:59] of God is going to imprison
[1:35:04] usings and you know traditions and the
[1:35:07] ideas of mass
[1:35:11] [Music]
[1:35:13] and religions and and things like that
[1:35:17] producer the purpose of God
[1:35:20] the children of man for the son for the
[1:35:23] son of man
[1:35:25] is one
[1:36:11] this is
[1:36:13] but what did man do with it
[1:36:16] mastered groups
[1:36:23] and then they're like if you're not part
[1:36:26] of us you're lost
[1:36:30] if you're not among our group you're
[1:36:32] lost
[1:36:34] if you're not a member of our church
[1:36:48] but goddess purpose has never changed
[1:36:54] is a very important to know the message
[1:37:02] brings back the children of God
[1:37:05] the purpose of God
[1:37:08] was given in the very beginning
[1:37:12] Hallelujah and so friends I want you to
[1:37:16] follow me closely here
[1:37:19] when Joshua received this instruction
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:54] which is right here in the Bible
[1:37:59] foreign
[1:38:54] and I read this many times but many of
[1:38:56] you are not here so let me read it again
[1:38:59] not one or not for one moment do I bring
[1:39:01] a message to
[1:39:03] follow me
[1:39:06] or join my church
[1:39:09] some fellowship and organizations
[1:39:45] that is the purpose of God
[1:39:48] to give us this Bible yes to
[1:39:52] re-establish us
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:03] where men become New Creations in Christ
[1:40:08] filled with his spirit
[1:40:10] and live according to his word
[1:40:13] I would invite plead and warn all to
[1:40:16] hear his voice at this time
[1:40:19] and healed your lives completely to him
[1:40:23] as a trust in my heart that I have given
[1:40:26] all my all to him
[1:40:30] praise the name of the Lord
[1:40:32] praise the name of Allah
[1:40:36] in another message he says Hear Me
[1:40:41] God will not deal with his church
[1:40:45] she comes back to the homelands
[1:40:53] what we call the message of the house
[1:40:56] is not what Luther called the message
[1:41:03] not the Believers of that time you but
[1:41:07] what was it charity God katonda was
[1:41:11] restoring
[1:41:13] his truth I must see my back again to
[1:41:16] the church
[1:41:24] because by that time your whole truth
[1:41:35] that God is not building
[1:41:38] a line He is building a house he's not
[1:41:41] building a wall he's building a house
[1:41:46] he's building a house
[1:41:49] and so you see that he says upon faith
[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:17] [Applause]
[1:42:51] it has always been
[1:43:50] and that was the message
[1:43:53] Sarah
[1:43:55] all those who did not hear it
[1:43:57] they missed out
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:02] was the main man of that time
[1:44:17] and the problem of it was
[1:44:20] they made a denomination
[1:44:24] listen listen they organized
[1:44:27] and whenever they organize
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:35] and so he says
[1:44:36] come back to the originals
[1:44:46] precipitation ideas
[1:45:06] who is shouting this the messenger of
[1:45:10] the hour
[1:45:12] this is the message
[1:45:14] what we call the message
[1:45:35] they decide to be
[1:45:43] to make a denomination
[1:45:48] this message is not to denominate
[1:45:52] it's not just to be followers
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:45:58] messages
[1:46:21] foreign
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:39] they are all wrong under all of the
[1:46:41] devil but within them
[1:46:43] is
[1:46:56] godly people in every one of them
[1:46:58] movements
[1:47:02] in itself is not of God everybody
[1:47:07] will never bless
[1:47:09] he has never done it he will never bless
[1:47:14] him God will never bless an organization
[1:47:19] I I fear sometimes when I hear people
[1:47:21] think oh God has blessed days of the
[1:47:23] voice fellowships
[1:47:28] people refresh their denominationals
[1:47:30] their denominations and their Church
[1:47:32] names more than the purpose
[1:47:41] all over the world I think the most
[1:47:44] churches that don't have advertisements
[1:47:51] a message believing churches
[1:47:55] the reason being our emphasis
[1:48:01] our emphasis
[1:48:11] and that's why we don't put a lot of
[1:48:13] signposts
[1:48:15] and it's okay to do it
[1:48:18] but I'm saying the reason why we don't
[1:48:21] emphasize on that is
[1:48:23] because we have a message
[1:48:27] a message to take us back again
[1:48:33] about the organizations
[1:48:45] and he says every each age has had its
[1:48:48] message and its Messengers
[1:48:52] through the times every age has sparked
[1:48:54] its message with a messenger
[1:48:57] um
[1:48:58] God in every dispensation
[1:49:01] he has sent forth someone Anointed with
[1:49:04] the Holy Spirit
[1:49:06] to bring forth his message for that age
[1:49:10] and he says every time every
[1:49:15] foreign
[1:49:33] [Music]
[1:50:01] only two foreign
[1:50:54] God brought frogs
[1:50:58] sovereign
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:58] foreign
[1:52:39] foreign
[1:53:57] imagine people foreign
[1:54:08] [Music]
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:45] and because God knows that you know it
[1:54:48] is the only way
[1:54:50] for his children to
[1:54:53] him
[1:54:56] as an insurance
[1:55:06] A stranger's voice
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:41] when normal world Chicago
[1:55:49] [Applause]
[1:56:33] foreign
[1:57:31] [Applause]
[1:57:33] that you are the only again
[1:58:24] not gonna hit we have been here
[1:58:28] some people are patient as long as
[1:58:30] things are working
[1:58:33] but when there is
[1:58:43] and these people they hanged on and I
[1:58:45] don't want to buy a cigarette
[1:58:48] since he had everything that noise
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:14] according to
[1:59:23] it shows that there is no water in the
[1:59:25] atmosphere
[1:59:29] and that old Noah is actually duping and
[1:59:34] lying the people
[1:59:36] it has been proved
[1:59:40] because there is no water
[1:59:45] it is
[1:59:55] the ones who are willing to be lied too
[1:59:59] as far as I'm concerned
[2:00:03] and the Bible says when they fall away
[2:00:05] again
[2:00:06] that there shall be no restoration
[2:00:23] and then you go back again
[2:00:26] Jesus Christ
[2:00:31] there is no more repentance
[2:00:46] yes again let me follow him
[2:00:50] let me follow him
[2:00:55] again I don't know if Pastor never
[2:00:57] followed us
[2:01:00] some people who fall away from the
[2:01:02] church
[2:01:03] and they expect the pastor to follow
[2:01:06] them
[2:01:10] please come back sister always
[2:01:31] foreign
[2:02:14] you are ordained to life
[2:02:18] that's why even when you wanted to run
[2:02:20] away
[2:02:25] what happened
[2:02:27] there is a seed of God in here
[2:02:40] I want to stay here yeah
[2:02:45] this is my place
[2:02:59] praise the name of the Lord
[2:03:04] they made with eight Souls
[2:03:08] Noah's message was the truth
[2:03:22] because it was so
[2:03:26] for foreign
[2:04:34] Hallelujah man
[2:04:36] when he when we preach things that we
[2:04:38] preach
[2:04:41] it looks out of place
[2:04:44] how can you tell a young man that you
[2:04:46] don't have to fornicate until you
[2:04:48] married
[2:05:01] and we have received the message
[2:05:05] of the hours restored us back again to
[2:05:08] the Bible
[2:05:10] and you are going to have a people
[2:05:14] that will be perfect
[2:05:22] what is the message
[2:05:30] hallelujah amen God has restored us back
[2:05:34] to himself foreign
[2:06:36] there is no place where it is recorded
[2:06:39] anyway
[2:06:43] about the Holy Spirit without sensation
[2:06:54] there was sensation
[2:06:58] the Bible says there was a rushing
[2:07:01] baby
[2:07:03] let us speak it louder
[2:07:05] Mighty Wind how do you think it was
[2:07:08] sounding yeah
[2:07:11] [Music]
[2:07:24] foreign
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:54] yeah man
[2:07:58] are you Tower
[2:07:59] and in a moment when I was drunk
[2:08:03] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:11] that's the god of the Bible That's the
[2:08:13] god of Pentecost
[2:08:15] there was
[2:08:17] more sure
[2:08:21] and our Prophet said in a religion has
[2:08:25] no emotions
[2:08:36] because
[2:10:17] [Applause]
[2:10:34] mother's performing
[2:10:50] that is
[2:10:55] out of that
[2:10:57] is an ideology
[2:11:03] but the message
[2:11:05] is not a thought it's not even just a
[2:11:10] mere learning
[2:11:13] and getting into the Mysteries
[2:11:17] that's not the message
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:32] which is the message
[2:11:35] the word of God in the book of First
[2:11:37] timoth he says
[2:11:53] when the word of God comes to you
[2:11:56] foreign
[2:12:23] when you search
[2:12:25] you find that in our generation
[2:12:28] of us try to play with us
[2:12:31] and he has made this message
[2:12:40] by restoring us
[2:12:42] who are you
[2:12:44] people think that we have been restored
[2:12:46] Allah
[2:12:51] the message is not a place where there
[2:12:54] is a set of rules
[2:13:06] he wants his life to dwell in us
[2:13:10] he wants his life to come
[2:13:13] and move us
[2:13:26] doing the better things he did
[2:13:31] listen I'm about to conclude if you've
[2:13:34] seen the Old Testament
[2:13:36] in the Old Testament rules and
[2:13:39] regulations
[2:13:44] foreign
[2:15:00] man you are no longer going to struggle
[2:15:03] what to dress
[2:15:05] the Holy Ghost is going to show you what
[2:15:08] to dress
[2:15:10] you're not going to talk about your hair
[2:15:17] that's why people who don't believe in
[2:15:19] the Holy Spirit
[2:15:25] we have seen the message of the hour and
[2:15:29] our Prophet was asked questions
[2:15:33] one of the questions like the first time
[2:15:35] I preached on this I left this this
[2:15:36] hanging and I want to give a little more
[2:15:39] before I conquerque
[2:15:43] foreign
[2:15:57] [Music]
[2:16:12] I
[2:16:13] I would like us to
[2:16:15] uh
[2:16:18] go to the book of First Corinthians
[2:16:19] Hallelujah
[2:16:22] [Music]
[2:16:36] okay First Corinthians chapter 11
[2:16:41] verses uh
[2:16:45] you can begin from verse
[2:16:48] the whole thing is nice
[2:16:50] let us read it from verses
[2:16:56] [Music]
[2:16:57] I think verses 3 gives the foundation
[2:17:03] he says but I would have you know that
[2:17:05] the head of every man is Christ and the
[2:17:07] head of the woman is the man and the
[2:17:08] head of of Christ is
[2:17:19] and every man praying or prophesying
[2:17:21] having his head covered this one as his
[2:17:23] head
[2:17:36] she tells us what's the head of every
[2:17:38] man
[2:17:42] Let Me Now read verse 4. every man
[2:17:46] praying all prophesying having his head
[2:17:48] covered this one as Christ
[2:17:54] um
[2:17:58] do we understand that let us go go on
[2:18:02] together
[2:18:03] the woman that prays or prophesies with
[2:18:06] our head and covered this one as her
[2:18:08] head
[2:18:36] foreign
[2:18:39] which is her
[2:18:41] husband yeah
[2:18:45] now for that is even all one as if she
[2:18:49] were seven
[2:18:53] now there is a mystery
[2:18:56] so the Bible talks about covering and
[2:19:01] knocks out if the woman does not
[2:19:03] covering her hair
[2:19:07] the Lord is the Bible did not say the
[2:19:09] woman covering her hair
[2:19:14] foreign
[2:19:40] let that also be shown
[2:19:48] [Music]
[2:19:52] let her be covered
[2:20:05] so in other words the woman should be
[2:20:07] covered
[2:20:10] um
[2:20:34] does it mean what does it mean
[2:20:37] that does it mean a clause
[2:20:40] does it mean like what is this Muslim
[2:20:43] thing
[2:20:46] foreign
[2:20:57] foreign
[2:22:08] praise the name of the Lord
[2:22:11] to save time let's read verse 15.
[2:22:14] verse 14 first does not even nature
[2:22:17] itself teach you that if a man have long
[2:22:20] hair it is a shamer to him
[2:22:27] [Music]
[2:22:29] but if a woman have long hair because
[2:22:34] wait the Bible says if a man has long
[2:22:39] hair or massage
[2:22:44] to him
[2:22:45] and remember the man said the head of
[2:22:49] the man is Christ
[2:22:51] if the man has long hair um
[2:23:27] but if a woman have long hair
[2:23:30] foreign
[2:23:32] [Applause]
[2:24:04] foreign
[2:24:59] for verse 5 every woman that prays to
[2:25:01] prophesies with our head uncovered this
[2:25:03] one as her hair
[2:25:11] let us explain it if a woman Cuts or
[2:25:14] trims are here
[2:25:21] the same as removing everything
[2:25:29] what should women do they should let
[2:25:32] their hair grow
[2:25:34] even nature itself
[2:25:38] but what should men do they should not
[2:25:42] let their hair growth
[2:25:47] foreign
[2:26:47] oh I need or maybe I don't have long

[2:38:21] you are not the only one with the Holy
[2:38:23] Spirit
[2:38:29] is going to give us one fashion
[2:38:33] all of you removed
[2:38:36] it is
[2:38:46] and then other scriptures can apply
[2:38:48] because they don't look like the world
[2:38:51] that is big in itself
[2:38:54] how would you know what looks like the
[2:38:56] world
[2:38:59] well of course if you have the spirit of
[2:39:01] God
[2:39:03] you will know even when you see someone
[2:39:06] coming in church
[2:39:11] but you will give them Grace
[2:39:14] they are new Believers
[2:39:17] let them get deeper in Christ
[2:39:24] in 20 years he will not have this
[2:39:27] hairstyle
[2:39:29] French cut I can assure you not even
[2:39:33] because
[2:39:33] he is is now a better Christian
[2:39:38] but because he has grown
[2:39:41] he has grown birth in the Lord
[2:39:46] physical appearance as well
[2:39:50] he is no longer wanting to appease
[2:39:56] but he has more purpose in his life
[2:40:01] why a young man running away
[2:40:04] because they're taught to do things
[2:40:05] which are actually not scriptures
[2:40:15] this is the message
[2:40:22] the message
[2:40:24] represent us before Jesus Christ
[2:40:39] now you brother Solomon will not like
[2:40:43] this hairstyle
[2:40:48] but it doesn't make it wrong
[2:40:53] I hope my deacons don't dick on me after
[2:40:55] this
[2:40:59] I'm telling you because you've had this
[2:41:02] in the message for a long time no
[2:41:06] Museum
[2:41:46] does our God
[2:41:48] have a standard for them and for us
[2:41:54] in Chinese
[2:42:02] what the brother has done
[2:42:05] is very very small
[2:42:07] they will begin from here um
[2:42:12] even preachers
[2:42:15] but in China it is all right name of
[2:42:17] China they like it very much
[2:42:21] so what am I trying to say if you're not
[2:42:24] exposed
[2:42:26] you've grown in one area
[2:42:29] you begin to think if people don't do
[2:42:32] things like you then
[2:42:36] but if they do things like you know
[2:42:39] they're good
[2:42:44] foreign
[2:43:12] foreign
[2:43:21] sister mother if you have the Holy Ghost
[2:43:24] I have to tell you how to dress
[2:43:30] we have seen them come in our church
[2:43:33] win trousers
[2:43:36] but we understand
[2:43:38] they are young in the face
[2:43:40] they don't understand
[2:44:06] that is not called preaching it is
[2:44:08] called
[2:44:11] the
[2:45:04] foreign
[2:45:14] [Applause]
[2:45:38] I believe when I ask I said we have a
[2:45:41] preacher from caramela some of you were
[2:45:42] aware
[2:45:45] we're going to have someone with half
[2:45:48] clothes
[2:45:53] saying praise God
[2:45:55] what happened he's dressed better than
[2:45:59] some of you yeah
[2:46:19] Hallelujah
[2:46:22] ladies
[2:46:35] Hallelujah
[2:46:36] if you ask me pastor and you do a French
[2:46:40] cards
[2:46:44] it looks weird
[2:46:47] but you see the measure of the spirit I
[2:46:49] have is not the measure somebody else
[2:46:54] and some people he and the others
[2:46:59] because of their attitude
[2:47:01] this woman came to Jesus
[2:47:04] you know everybody knew she was a
[2:47:06] prostitute
[2:47:16] really
[2:47:38] you know many times we want we want
[2:47:39] Jesus to chase our Sinners
[2:47:45] because he wants to change them
[2:47:49] okay
[2:48:20] Jesus hears all your thoughts yes
[2:48:26] and he had what she said
[2:48:30] I think it was Peter whoever I said
[2:48:32] Peter
[2:48:33] Simone
[2:48:35] I could really think the rules are
[2:48:38] I don't know
[2:48:40] and then he began to give him a story of
[2:48:45] foreign
[2:48:57] [Music]
[2:49:12] her expression of love to Jesus
[2:49:17] [Music]
[2:49:20] even before she was transformed
[2:49:24] so you see you have a lot of people
[2:49:27] coming in church
[2:49:31] [Music]
[2:49:37] that this is a hospital
[2:49:40] and I'm concluding I'm really done
[2:49:42] preaching myself
[2:49:44] this is a hospital
[2:49:51] you know better that you have different
[2:49:55] patients
[2:49:56] at different levels of of of sickness
[2:50:01] and different levels
[2:50:34] is the only problem
[2:50:51] with you but as long as the pulpit and
[2:50:56] security is giving the right measure of
[2:50:58] the world
[2:51:00] let them come in
[2:51:04] Sinners
[2:51:06] [Applause]
[2:51:08] the world will work on them
[2:51:12] because the word
[2:51:15] and even our attitude
[2:51:22] we shouldn't always see through the
[2:51:24] glasses of judgment
[2:51:28] this word is
[2:51:31] this word is
[2:51:34] and if it wasn't for Grace you wouldn't
[2:51:37] be here
[2:51:39] let Grace do its perfect
[2:51:44] in every one of us
[2:51:54] it was wrong did you jump and someone
[2:51:57] said hey you stopped using that style
[2:51:59] all right you stopped using that stuff
[2:52:02] what happened where is this is what I
[2:52:05] want again he doesn't even know what
[2:52:08] changes
[2:52:24] don't look at him as if you're going to
[2:52:26] kill him again
[2:52:51] that's what I want and to change what
[2:52:54] God wants
[2:52:56] that is the message
[2:53:06] oh if God can do that for us
[2:53:10] see real real solid Believers
[2:53:16] hypocrisy
[2:53:20] quite frankly I'm okay with somebody who
[2:53:22] is just seated
[2:53:25] and when you're saying is
[2:53:29] [Music]
[2:53:41] doing what he's doing it
[2:53:43] let me go out when I go we're not going
[2:53:47] that God will begin
[2:53:52] but what do you think is
[2:53:58] [Applause]
[2:54:14] oh what do you want to have
[2:54:16] let him come there beaten down
[2:54:20] don't say brother now
[2:54:23] that's cool
[2:54:27] don't ever frustrate the people
[2:54:30] if they're like no don't worry leave
[2:54:32] them alone they're not fine leave them
[2:54:34] alone
[2:54:37] that's why the people who are playing
[2:54:39] Brothers pray for the ministers
[2:55:14] foreign
[2:55:19] foreign
[2:55:44] [Applause]
[2:56:39] what is see you've got on Petty issues
[2:56:48] that is not the message
[2:56:50] say that the message of there was laid
[2:56:52] the foundations
[2:57:26] I always told you that whatever I preach
[2:57:28] on the pulpits
[2:57:31] it's what I've started it's sort of seen
[2:57:33] in the words
[2:57:42] of God ever true
