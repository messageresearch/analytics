all right i mean it says okay i have not reached my bible here but i have the scripture with you amen praise the lord come here i just all right so i did have that match marked out for easy okay we are reading chapter six chapter seven rather than verses 26 now you're going to hear from the words of from a man who had the greatest wisdom on earth and he says again what i applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of foley even of foolishness and madness and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands who so pleases god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her era maybe timber name economy amen may the lord bless the reading of the word you may have your seats come home i i have been a i was asked and i took this subject already i with uh i do not remember the name of the church no yeah yeah yes yes yes evening light brighter banaco evening light so i took one i spoke on this subject that is just last night [Music] so i preached to them first but you are hearing the message first this message the subject but i i know i will not finish this subject also tonight uh i will check it again maybe on sunday the lord willing uh brother you're [Music] it is in christ alone where the bride should come hey yo you are in christ no matter where you are when the trumpet sounds you will find you ready in the right place grace you will be able to go for the rapture praise the name of the lord so tonight we are speaking on the snares of a child of god can you find a better word for snails yes that's the old word the snares of a child of god a young man now we all here are children of god for now everyone knows these words were spoken by a man who was the man with the greatest wisdom in the world and he said that i find more bitter than death the woman argument is snares and nets timber can you read that again in uganda verse 26 okay read it this way and i find more bitter than death the woman oh mukazee whose heart is snares and nets [Music] and her bun under her hands as bands name econo jay bianca you see and he says that whosoever pleases the lord he has sent you some camera he will escape from her but the sinner will not the sinner it shall be taken by her own friends i think a woman is a great thing but the banham said that the next best thing that a man can get aside from salvation organization it can be the worst thing that a man can get in here if he does not marry a good wife and so when we talk about a woman you see by the bottom say that if you want to see the nature if you want to see the church the the character of the church look themselves around men that shows you the character of that child and also we know that the church itself is typed as a woman [Music] that kind of a woman after what he claims to be homosexual no matter how he shows and portrays himself it shows what kind of a man he is [Applause] [Music] maybe it depends on what type of woman we are talking about you see it is so important she is so important but even the devil himself he was not having he did not have the ability to get to adam they have several funerals but he needed without the assistance of a woman because he needed to use the woman in the garden of eden but the bible comes back later in the book of first timothy chapter 2 and they say that a woman was in the transgression but i want to show you also that the woman is so much important not only for the bad reasons but also for the good reasons god could not save the world come without a woman because a prophecy was already given the book of genesis he says that the seed of the serpent shall [Music] now of course you see how important a woman is and and angel came to mary and say that uh you are blessed hail mary you are blessed among women and indeed is because we know that jesus was not as it was not an offspring of mary but jesus was an offspring of god whoever yes he was the seed of god in that way but why does the bible call her the seed of the woman is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] his own [Applause] so you can see how important a woman is [Music] it takes one woman [Applause] and that was eve coward do you see how strong a woman can be about ammonia and here is the man with the greatest wisdom on the earth and he comes and he [Music] whose heart is snares and necks praise the name of the lord so there is a woman white woman but her heart humanity my way snares and nets what is a snare oh a snare is a controver a often consisting of a noose or a rope for entangling birds or mammals um something deceptively attractive oh my god our heart is that type that entangles speak other people that that involves people in difficulties through the the the the the story of samson how god had given samson the greatest strength on earth why because the lighter's heart was snares and nets how many have ever set up a snare but all right you have never set up any snare sister yes that's a snap all right now inserting a snare consideration is made as to what exactly which as to what is meant as to exactly which are the usual parts of the target when you are setting up a target for the ride but when you're setting up a trap for the rack but won't take a message you don't just set it up anywhere tomorrow not so similar why because these kind these wraps you know in the house how a specific path they take so when you're setting a snare you said you consider the usual path of your target this could be past leading to food already made it to desires so very and and then you put something like a what a rat doesn't eat no take away you cannot do that if you want to drop a rat we're gonna take a minute you will put something it usually or take away cheating messages you will put some fish or take a cat canyon you will put something that you have like nuts something which will attract the right i can't i can ask and of course you know that you're putting that trap or that snare in the path of that rack so snares are laid even in the world for people who go hunting they put those snares in the world in the usual path the animals take but again if you are going to put a snare for let's say uh cheetah or something of the country you cannot again put a trap that would drop a rat i need to take care of myself you have to put a a trap or a snare the size of your target or tigger or when cannon opening and nature are you following me this is how they lay a snail wait a minute again and then you know if you're you're trying to trap uh uh you know this will be pigs you know how to trap them angrily oh man you know where it usually passes i know what it is where it goes for food where it goes for whatever reason and then you will find those parts and try and lay a snare come on hallelujah i mean now friends in the same way [Music] [Music] now this type of a woman she is intending to drop somebody now of course they must be the target why do you not buy which who is this woman but a snare [Music] it's all about laying people in bondage that you need to move it's all about strength she is going to let the snare i could take caretakers for people now go take a bantu in there you use your parts i hope somebody's following me hallelujah hallelujah let us first read one scripture so you can be able to get ah speaking about hallelujah by my mind read now revelation 17 is and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come heather i will show unto thee the judgment of the great wall that's seated upon them upon many waters is a woman are you following me she's a woman you you read first to you is what i'm talking about in english it says the inhabitants of the earth have made been made drunk with the wine of heart fornication verse 3 so he carried me and went the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a sketch cannot be full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and seven horns amen now we find out that this woman [Music] the waters are symbolizing people's nations and tanks if you if you read the world chapter you will get a lot of the interpretations that we are believers of the message because for us we have more teachings she has overcome the world inside you and here all the good kings of the world not she claimed that jesus was her husband [Music] from the government program government don't think it's going to attack us from the politicians is what is within since they needed a worship stone worship the creation of god within them to worship one word that the devil knows we must take citadel i need to take it when you come in the bible you find that apostle paul came to a place right now found people worshipping and they did not know that god the name if god took you out of your denomination and then you feel the first to go back you have never found god means you have never met god but if you met god one decide [Music] [Music] [Music] but as long as [Music] do you know what it means to worship god in the spirit and in truth oh that doorman changed the results but when you come to church there was another spectator that when you come to church never james can you say you are a participant that's the reason why we left the baptist churches and the other foreign [Applause] some of you have never been in those denominations you may not understand and the people's work is to cheat and enjoy [Music] [Music] [Applause] whereby we don't only act in the church but even when we go outside today when we live the life of the gospel we experience a living god to so maybe you want to go back and listen on the archives hallelujah now i'll read a quote here and as i continue to preach praise the name of the lord it is more worthy of not that the very name satire means dominating female 1 even when you join them they make you sign on a book somewhere quandary our souls are owned by god himself for he is the past and bishop of our souls [Music] of faith and we are not controlled by a church a referendum we are not controlled by a church system [Applause] i'm coming back that's his message our sisters in their right places moving forward will be too full of a place of obedience of subjection [Music] having you are looking down on a woman i got my name ammonium and certain times it seems as though they don't that you are taking their rights away the moment we come to the knowledge of jesus christ we're too many years to christian and we accept him as lord of our souls them be here you'll be able i'm going more dead because the bible says submit yourselves to your own husbands in every city so you have given away your rights that's why the bible [Applause] you find a woman in a miniskirt they call themselves [Applause] [Music] so the moment we married the christ returned and into four christians to give away our rights to him we have no rights to fight for the two children can i hear and i mean so that's why they want me you have no rights to fight for the truth that's why my sister the moment you agreed to marry that man they [Music] is spirit no kidding obedience holy spirit teach you submission not as a woman but also as a church where we the whitest man in the world ever saw was solomon um and he said i applied my heart to no one to search and to seek out wisdom [Music] foreign are the snares and nets [Music] [Music] the lord let me tell you church of god you please the lord will send yourself escaped from the clouds and the bones of this kind of woman from the yes she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the man not to be submissive when your husband makes you happy not to be submissive when your husband tells you what you want to hear not to be submissive when your husband braves you but to be submissive it is the laws of god because it types the spiritual command memorial that is commanded of her woman who is truly female or mukesh [Music] oh [Applause] if you find a man abusing a woman almost younger whether or not is his wife obama has to oversee him that's not a real man it seems like you're a normal daughter a real man inside your name do not treat for he is the head of the house but remember that if you're the head of the house the woman is your queen so you treat her like a queen if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted and any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is all supervised [Music] he gives us a reason he says that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertains that's why she doesn't cut her hair means even to wear garments that pertain to a male or cutter when she dies she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself [Music] and when a woman invades the pulpit which is commanded she must not do she shows what speech she is oh hero hallelujah i mean being a dominating female is antichrist [Music] [Applause] and the seeds of the of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this superhero name [Applause] hallelujah she has when it comes to the word let god be true in every manner because the true female is submissive to god she has no thoughts before you do anything if your head ship says yes then you go ahead and come over again and then he says agamba but what about this church can you say no she has cast out the word yeah destroy the bibles and what the essence of the godly nazi kill is the bible is your name she has slain those who would preach the truth she has taken over kings princes and nations she controls armies and insists that she is the true body of christ that her popes are the vicars of christ christians she is entirely seduced by the devil oh you ascend the west in the west until she is in in turn until she in turn has become the seducer of others she is the bride of saturn and she oh my goodness and she has produced his bastard um but i thank god there is a bride of christ and never said to the white woman who will be submissive to every word of god i am the bride of christ hallelujah [Music] and the devil through this system has used the paths of worship to lay a snare for the children so you find people a yara tigger you find bastards more than one voice they have been ensnared because what does the bible say [Music] what is happening it is an ensnare moteco the devil desires to snare people sit on your head less snails for them for you in a bar so much sin in the church people worshipping god messages but when sometimes you hear them confess some things about today [Music] but we need god's grace nature takes such a catherine for tonight i'll finish from there those who have missed the first part please go and listen to it after this [Music] the devil has laid stairs for people where they can't even worship in truth whereby these songs [Music] above all power [Music] created this and all the ways [Music] were here before the world began [Music] above all kind of [Music] know [Music] treasures [Music] there is no way [Music] [Music] [Applause] is like a rose [Music] and thought of me oh [Music] oh [Music] and thought of me [Laughter] above all power [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] you were here before the wild [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] measured [Music] oh
