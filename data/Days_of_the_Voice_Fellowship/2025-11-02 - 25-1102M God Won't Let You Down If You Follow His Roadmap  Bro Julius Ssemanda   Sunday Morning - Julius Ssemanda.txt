Father, in the name of Jesus, We have read of your word. Open it in wisdom, in revelation and inspiration. Anoint us. Anoint your people. Bless us all in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God richer bless you. Amen. Amen. It's kind of hard to stand here and talk to the children of God because it's not that the people are too great, &gt;&gt; but what makes them great &gt;&gt; is because they have been purchased with a great price. The precious blood of the lamb. So what makes the people of God great is what he purchased them with. Hallelujah. So it's you can't come and start to play before them. Seek your own glory. and things like that. You have got to to be sober. So and the people also have got to believe the preacher. God told brother if you can get the people to believe you no not disease shall stand before your prayer [Music] not even canc. The people have got to believe their channel. Then believe what comes out of the channel. If it matches with us, they must believe that this is God's time. This is God's divine plan. Then you WILL GO OUT WITH SOMETHING. I want us to talk about my subject is God won't turn you down if you follow the road map. God won't TURN YOU DOWN IF YOU FOLLOW HIS road map. No, HE CAN'T TURN YOU DOWN. HE CAN'T LET YOU GO DISAPPOINTED if you follow his road map. If God HAS GOT ANYTHING WITH HIM, it must be for his people, ALL THE RICHES AND HIS GLORY, ALL HIS POWER. HE SAYS MY POWER IS YOURS. WHY HE OVERCAME? HE OVERCAME FOR YOU. WHY JESUS TOOK YOUR SINS THAT YOU MIGHT BECOME THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD. BUT HOW TO ATTAIN THAT? THERE HAS GOT TO BE A WAY. SO IF EASY PEOPLE if if if IF WHAT IF GOD HAS SOMETHING IT HAVING IT FOR HIMSELF it doesn't DO HIM ANY GOOD. IT HAS GOT TO BE FOR EASY PEOPLE BECAUSE OUR GOD IS NOT A SELFISH GOD. Our God IS NOT A SELFSEED GOD. HE THINKS ABOUT HIS PEOPLE MORE THAN HE THINKS ABOUT HIMSELF. HE'S A GOOD FATHER BECAUSE A FATHER EXPRESSES SACRIFICIAL LOVE. THE EXPRESSIONS OF GOD AND HIS DESIRES ARE FOR HIS PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS, "MY THOUGHTS TOWARDS YOU ARE TOO GREAT. EVERY CANNOT BE NUMBERED. IF I COULD THINK ABOUT THEM, THEY ARE MORE THAN STAND UP FOR DAY AND NIGHT. HE THINKS ABOUT YOU. WHAT SHOULD I DO FOR JULIUS? OH, I KNOW HE WILL TURN THIS WAY. HOW CAN I GET HIM THAT WAY? WHAT SHOULD I DO FOR BROTHER JONAH? I KNOW HE DESIRE SUCH AND SUCH THING. OH, HE WON'T TURN YOU DOWN WHAT HE DOES NOW. Job had an issue. I said if I KNEW WHERE I CAN FIND HIM AND I go TO HIS SEAT AND I PLEAD MY CASE, I JUST REACH WHERE HE IS AND I PLEAD MY CASE. I KNOW he won't turn me down. I know he won't TURN ME DOWN. BUT HE HAD A QUESTION if I KNEW IF I KNEW NOW MAN IN HIS FOREIGN state cannot approach GOD BECAUSE IT'S WHY GOD DROVE away man. Adam and Eve he drove from them away from his presence. They could not commune with WITH HIM BECAUSE GOD cannot be where THERE IS A SIN. SO HE DROVE THEM AWAY FROM HIS PRESENCE. BUT GOD IS A GOOD GOD. HE HAD TO PROVIDE A WAY. HE DESIRES FELLOWSHIP WITHIN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS. WHEN THE THINGS HAPPENED THERE, THERE HAS GOT TO BE A WAY BACK TO GOD. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A ROAD AND THAT ROAD HAS GOT TO HAVE A MAP. HOW TO GET ABOUT THAT ROAD? WHEN GOD GIVES A ROAD, HE GIVES A MAP TO THE ROAD. YOU DON'T GO ABOUT IT. He has got A MAP TO THE ROAD. IT'S AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING there be anything GOOD FROM GOD ANYTHING GOOD IN HIM OF WHICH THERE IS MANY GREAT RICHES PRECIOUS THINGS WHICH ARE ETERNAL AND SOME ARE TEMPORAL THAT COME FROM OUR GOD AND OUR GOD IS THE ONLY FORM OF ETERNAL SO THE ONLY WAY GET THAT ETERNAL LIFE THERE'S GOT TO BE A ROAD MAN HAS ALWAYS MAN HAS ALWAYS LONGED FOR GOD LIKE JOB WAS LONGING. I WISH I COULD GO THERE DOWN IN HIS COURT. LET HIM KNOW ABOUT MY CONFIDENCE. THE BITTERNESS IN MY SOUL JUST DOWN. I'M SO DOWN. I WISH I COULD KNOW WHERE TO FIND THIS GOD. HE WOULD NOT TURN ME DOWN. HE LONGED TO SEEK GOD TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE TO GET BACK TO GOD. IT'S THE DESIRE OF EVERY MAN LONGING FOR GOD. BUT YET sometimes many think MANY THINK THAT BY WISDOM, SCIENCE, BY THEIR STRENGTH, BY KNOWLEDGE, THEY WANT TO MAKE A WAY FOR THEMSELVES BACK TO GOD. MAN HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT IN THEIR OWN WAY AND GOD HATES IT. WHEN MAN TRIES TO DO IT IN HIS OWN WAY BECAUSE ALL THE WAYS OF MAN NOT GOD'S WAY AND ALL THE IMAGINATIONS OF THE THOUGHT THERE ARE EVIL CONTINUE AND THAT'S THE TROUBLE OF IT TODAY WANT TO SEE GOD MANY WANT TO USE GOD THAT YOU CAN'T USE GOD WILL AND YOU WANT TO LET GO AND YOU CAN'T let go. BROTHER, THE PEOPLE TODAY SCRIPTURE SAYS THE WISDOM OF MEN IS THE FOOLISHNESS BEFORE GOD CANNOT PROSPER AND IT CAN'T WORK. GO BACK IN THE DAYS OF THE BABEL IN GENESIS 11. THE PEOPLE OF ONE LANGUAGE AND THEY UNITED THEMSELVES AND THEY MADE A GREAT DOMINATION AND they made a great DOMINATION FOR THEMSELVES AND THEY SAID GO TO NOW. LET US BUILD OURSELVES A GO. WHO'S THE TOP may reach UNTO HEAVEN? OH, THE TOP OF THE TOWER THAT CAN GET US UP UNTO HEAVEN and God saw that and he came down and he destroyed that and HE SCATTERED THEM. SO THE WISDOM OF THE WISE SHALL ALWAYS FAIL. BUT GOD EXALTS THE ENEMY AND GOD I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR GOD IN SIMPLICITY THE SIMPLIST OF GOD. YOU DON'T NEED A PSYCHOP. YOU DON'T NEED A PSYCHOPEDIA. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ELOQUENT. You don't NEED TO KNOW TOO MUCH OF ENGLISH. AND YOU KNOW HIM THE LORD JESUS. THAT'S LIFE. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A PROVIDER ACCEPTABLE TO GOD THROUGH WHICH MAN CAN APPROACH THE LIVING GOD AND RECEIVE THAT WHICH IS HIDDEN IN HIM. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THE HIDDEN WISDOM OF GOD, THE MYSTERY OF GOD WHICH WE SPEAK IN WISDOM, THE PRINCESS OF THIS WORLD DO NOT KNOW ABOUT. LISTEN BROTHER TODAY IS NOT BY POWER. IT'S NOT BY MIGHTY. IT'S BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THAT'S THE WISDOM OF GOD. GOD GAVE MAN his desire but man still fail to SEE besides God providing a way. Not many are able to walk in it. Very few FIND IT. VERY FEW CAN WALK THERE. IT'S because it's a narrow. &gt;&gt; It's a narrow way. &gt;&gt; Not that it cannot contain many. We sing a song. There is room. And when he set the supper, when he he SET THE SUPPER, he said, "GO AND CALL THEM THAT ARE BEATEN TO COME to the WEDDING TO COME TO THE SUPPER AND THEY COULD NOT COME." HE SAID GO TO THE STREETS AND BUY and call. THEY WENT AND CALLED HIM. THE SERANT SAID THERE is a room. GOD SAID GO BACK. SO THERE IS A ROOM AT THE FOUNTAIN. BUT THE WAY IS NARROW MEANING IT IS HARD WAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We are talking about the road map. A road map in a business, it's a strategic PLAN in business and projects. It's a strategic plan THAT DEFINES A GOAL. IT DEFINES A DESIRED OUTCOME. It includes the major steps, MILESTONES needed to reach the goal. A ROAD MAP IS A HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC PLAN. High level, STRATEGIC PLAN that visually represents the goals. the major STEPS AND TIMELINE FOR ACHIEVING A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE. Look brother, A VISION ROAD MAP IS A COMMUNICATION TOOL. It is CREATED AND PRESENTED TO GET ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS and the EXECUTIVES and your entire team. ALIGN IT ON ONE STRATEGY. SO THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR MOST IMPACTFUL WORK. So that THEY CAN DO THEIR MOST IMPACTFUL WORK. I WANT YOU TO PUT ON YOUR spiritual glasses. A road map. It's on paper. IT'S PHYSICAL. IT GIVES YOU THE ENTIRE TRIP. THE MAP of the road. NOW that the other one was of business and PROJECT now this one is of the ROAD WHICH GIVES YOU THE ENTIRE TRIP. It keeps you AWARE of your surroundings. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the BEST WAY TO TRAVEL anywhere is to plan ahead. Part of planning ahead is getting an OVERVIEW of your entire trip. YOU GET AN OVERVIEW of your entire trip. THEN YOU SEPARATE THE ROAD MAP BEFORE YOU AND YOU START TO POINT. I'M RIGHT HERE. I I I have planned that I have to DO SUCH A THING ACCORDING TO THE ROAD MAP. I CAN DO IT AT THIS CHURCH. AND THIS I CAN DO IT HERE. AND THIS I CAN DO IT HERE UNTIL I REACH MY FINAL DESTINATION. I have my road map. I WILL HAVE A SUCCESSFUL COURTSHIP AND BE ENGAGED. I WROTE IT YEARS BACK WHEN I WAS POOR. AND IT CAME TO PASS, we are talking about a road map, BROTHER SISTER. YOU DON'T NEED SOMETHING THAT WILL LOSE A SIGNAL. You don't need something to to guide you along the way that will lose a signal. That's the wisdom OF MEN. WHEN TROUBLES COME, WHEN DISCOURAGEMENTS COME, WHEN DISAPPOINTMENTS COME, THEY LOSE A SIGNAL, THEY SHUT DOWN, THEY DON'T HAVE A ROAD MAP. THIS IS HOW IT WORKS. YOU YOU YOU WHEN YOU SPREAD THAT ROAD MAP, YOU SEARCH, YOU FIND WHERE YOU ARE. I'm here. Where do I WANT TO GO? I WANT TO GO HERE. OH, I feel I look THROUGH THE ENTIRE I know WHICH WAY IT TURNS THIS WAY. WHEN I TURN, WHEN DO I FIND WHERE IS THE PETROL STATION? WHERE IS THE TRAFFIC? WHERE IS THE FOREST? WHERE IS THE LAKE? IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST it gives me a full TRIP &gt;&gt; and not now. You always need a current road map. IT HAS GOT TO BE CARRIED BECAUSE THE FEATURES WHICH WERE HERE 10 YEARS and they are not the fishes. SO YOU NEED A CURRENT ROAD. It will GIVE YOU THE SAME PLACE BUT IT SHOWS YOU ALL GLORY. IT SHOWS YOU WHAT'S AROUND THAT PLACE AT THAT TIME in that moment. as someone I think someone has got to cut. The road map HAS TO BE A CURRENT ONE UP TO DATE [Music] 1956. NOW THIS BLESSED OLD BIBLE IS THE ROAD MAP to the CRED to the grave. AND TO HEAVEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH. IT SAYS THIS BLESSED HOLY BIBLE IS THE ROAD MAP &gt;&gt; TO THE WHERE WE CAME FROM AND TO THE GRAVE BACK TO HEAVEN AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH. LISTEN THIS BLESSED OLD BIBLE. IF YOU HAVE ANY GOAL, THERE'S GOT TO BE ONE SIMILAR to it in the BIBLE or else it's it's wrong. It will show you THE OUTCOME AND THE STEPS YOU NEED. SOMEONE HAS got someone may tell me Brother Julius, I MAY DESIRE SOMETHING. I HAVE NO EXAMPLE of it in the Bible. Brother, I don't know how you get the scripture. IT SAYS ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. It is covered there. I DON'T see anyone that got a job at the airport, brother. That's not how we do it. He says, "AND WE LOVE IT BECAUSE THE CONTENTS OF THIS IS WHERE WE FIND THE PLAN OF SALVATION to serve to the uttermost." AND BEFORE WE OPEN IT, LET US SPEAK TO THE AUTHOR. THE AUTHOR AND HIS WORD ARE JUST THE SAME AND THE AUTHOR OF IT IS THE REVEALER OF IT. Listen brother, YOU NEED THE AUTHOR OR YOU APPROACH WHAT HE WROTE. You must know the author really well. He says it is THE ENTIRE PLANET. IT JUST GIVES YOU ALL THE TRUTH. IN THE BOOK OF JOSHUA CHAPTER 3 verse 1 TO4 HE SAYS AND JOSHUA WAS EARLY IN THE morning and they removed from AND CAME TO JORDAN HE AND ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND LORD THERE BEFORE THEY PASSED OVER AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THEIR THREE DAYS THAT THE OFFICERS WENT THROUGH THE host [Music] and they commanded the people listen saying when YOU SEE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT WITH THE LORD YOUR GOD AND THE PRIESTS BEARING IT THEN HE SHALL REMOVE FROM YOUR PLACE AND GO AFTER YET THERE SHALL BE A SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND IT ABOUT 2,000 BY MEASURE. COME NOT NEAR UNTO IT THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE WAY BY WHICH YOU MUST KNOW. FOR YE HAVE NOT PASSED THIS WAY. YOU HAVE NOT PASSED THIS WAY HERE TOO FAR. LISTEN BROTHER, HE SAYS WHEN THE TIME TO MOVE COMES THE IT TAKES THE ARK OF THE COVENANT. WHEN you see the LEAR AND THE STARTS TO MOVE, HE SAYS YOU SHALL FOLLOW THE ARK OF THE COVENANT. YOU KNOW THE WAY. THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE WAY WHICH YOU OUGHT TO GO. LISTEN, MY BROTHER, WHEN THE JUNCTION OF TIME HAS COME, God inspires the pastor. GOD INSPIRES THE PASTOR. WHEN THE TIME COMES TO CHANGE TO MOVE, GOD INSPIRES THE PREACHER. AND WHEN THE PREACHER COMES TO THE WORLD AND IT IS PREACHING PROSPERITY AND IT IS IN MONEY BROTHER AND MOVE but the PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE THE PRINCIPLES OF GOD THE PREACHER INSPIRES HIM BECAUSE IT IS TIME FOR THE CHURCH TO REPENTANCE TO move to REPENTANCE TO REPENTANCE. AND THE PREACHER COMES WITH A MESSAGE OF REPENTANCE, REPENTANCE AND IT'S NOT TIME TO FORGIVE. THE PREACHER WILL COME BEARING THE ARK OF THE GOD. WHICH HAS THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD WHICH IS THE LIVING WORD OF GOD AND HE WILL PREACH FORGIVENESS. LET THE CHURCH MOVE AND THE BIT OF CLOUD AND A BIT OF FIRE MOVE BACK YOUR OUT OF YOUR BACK UP EVERYTHING. DON'T DISTURB IT WHEN THE AR OF GOD IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THE WAY AND YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THAT. YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THAT TRUTH. SO GOD WHO WALKED THE WAY, THE LORD JESUS WALKED AND TRIED ALL THE WAY. IF I WAS BORN, HE CAME ON THE UPON THE EARTH AND HE SAW ALL MY BODY SAID, "THIS IS MY SON." AND GOD WALKED MY BODY. GLORY. HE WALKED MY PATH. HE WORKED MY PATTERNS. MY SINS PASS THROUGH MY TRIALS. AND HE WENT THROUGH AND REACHED THE END. THEN HE SAW MY END. AND HE SAID, "THE END OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS GOD." NOW THEN HE COMES AFTER YOU ARE BORN AND HE SAYS NO MOVE THAT WAY but move the one TELLING YOU TO MOVE AS YOU PASSED THERE BEFORE the young men are too heady SOMETIMES and women you know young men and me actually all THE PEOPLE SOMEONE will tell them you know I'VE BEEN IN THAT DON'T GO THAT WAY THEY SAID LET ME GO AND I SEE OH BROTHER HE SAYS YOU HAVE NEVER PASSED THIS way the road IS ROUGH AND THERE ARE MANY DERS SO HE SAYS COME WALK WITH COME WALK WITH ME. AND HE SAYS, "COME FOLLOW ME." LISTEN, BROTHER. MOVE WITH GOD. MOVE WHERE YOU LIVE. MOVE WITH A SERMON. MOVE WITH A SERMON BECAUSE IT IS GOD DIRECTING THE PRIEST. AND HE SAYS HE NOW COME. IT'S TIME TO GO TO HIGHER LEVEL. IT'S TIME TO POSSESS JESUS. IT HAS GOT TO BE THE VOICE that says now to possess. IT'S TIME TO POSSESS. GOD IS PROVIDED WAY OF DEALING WITH SIN. HE SAYS GOD'S PROVIDED WAY OF DEALING WITH SIN. GOD HAS A WAY. WE HAVE A WAY. BUT OUR WAYS ARE NOT GOD'S WAYS. AND WE CAN'T BE IN OUR WAY. WE CAN'T BE IN OUR WAY. AND GOD'S THE WAY. WE CAN'T BE in our way. Yes. WE CAN'T BE IN OUR WAY AND GOD'S WAY AT THE SAME TIME. JUST LIKE A ROAD MAP. WHEN I GET READY TO GO HOME, I DON'T SAY, "WELL, now I set a compass that perhaps I live directly east and north from here." Well, if I just TOOK OUT IN THAT DIRECTION, I WOULDN'T GET OUT OF THE CITY. But you know, you get a compass to show you east. Then you START TO GO EAST. LOOK, BROTHER, THERE'S no way over there. You need a road map to pass. Get where THE There is been a provided way made for me. I get A ROAD MAP. SEE which road. HALLELUJAH. SOMEONE WILL GET IN THE MESSAGE. IF SOMEONE WOULD COME ANOINTED, IF SOMEONE WOULD COME READY TO MOVE, IT'S TIME TO MOVE THAT FELLOW WILL MOVE. IF HE COMES READY TO RISE, THAT WILL RISE BECAUSE GOD COMES AND SAYS TURN THIS WAY. He said see which way the ROAD TURNS. IT says I see which way the road turns. I see the mark where I turn to the left and to the right and so forth and follow that map closely. AND I FOLLOW THAT MAP CLOSELY. I WILL MAKE MY WAY HOME BY the grace of God. So he says when I SET TO GO HOME, I DON'T JUST SAY IS FOLLOW EXACTLY. GOD BLESS YOU, BROTHER. I FOLLOW IT CLOSELY and I will make my way home by the grace of God. He says WELL WELL GOD HAS A MAP. HE HAS A PROVIDED WAY HAS to go home tomorrow. HE HAS A PROVIDED WAY FOR SALVATION. HE HAS A PROVIDING WAY FOR DIVINE HEALING. HAS A PROVIDING WAY FOR THE WORLD TO BE OPERATED. A CHILD OF GOD LIVING IN THE WORLD. GOD HAS MADE A WAY FOR THEM IT HOW THEY OUGHT TO OPERATE. HE HAS A PROVIDED WAY. FOR THE CHURCH HAS A PROVIDED WAY FOR THE CHURCH. THE CHURCH IS TO BE OPERATED BY NINE SPIRITUAL GIFTS BY THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS GIFTS AND SIGNS AND WONDERS IN THE CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. GOD IS THAT'S GODLY PROVIDED WAY OF PERFECTING HIS CHURCH. LISTEN BROTHER, IT DOESN'T matter how many ser you listen over to YouTube. LISTEN THIS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU WILL NEVER BE PERFECTED. IF YOU DON'T GIVE ATTENTION TO WHAT is preached in your LOCAL God is blessed FOR YOU where your duty IS TO BE PERFECTED. EVERYTHING ELSE, EVERY OTHER MESSAGE IS TRUE. IT ADDS IT TO YOUR PERFECTION. I know what I'm talking about. I know it brother 100%. You will ask it the pastor when it's not true. GOD HAS A PROVIDED WAY OF PERFECTING his church. We try anything else. THEOLOGY, THEOLOGY, TEACHING, ANYTHING ELSE, IT WILL NEVER WORK. YOU CAN HAVE TOO MUCH OF GOD IN THE HEAD AND NOTHING OF HIM IN THE HEART. I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF HIM IN THE HEART, TOO MUCH OF HIM IN the head. No, I'm saying I would rather have too much of HIM IN THE HEART. DONE TOO MUCH OF HIM because he wants THE HEART. NO MATTER THE THEOLOGY, THE TEACHING WHATSOEVER, IT SAYS IT WILL NEVER WORK. IT NEVER DID AND IT WILL NEVER DO. It never will. I know too much of the message. I know too much of the Bible. BROTHER, THAT'S NOT IT. IT'S NOT I THAT LIVETH, BUT CHRIST THAT LIVETH. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. WE GOT TO COME BACK TO GOD'S WAY to support the church. Not making blankets and having super suppers, BUT EVERY MAN PAYING HIS TITHING into the church. You don't think we are going to open up a certain business that will make us MONEY AND OFFERINGS BRING IT TO THE CHURCH DOING THE WAY GOD SAID DO GOD PROVIDED WAY FOR THAT PROVIDED FOR A MAN TO COME INTO THE CHURCH TODAY. The way we BRING MEN INTO THE CHURCH, GIVE him a letter, bring him into the church, the right hand of fellowship and sprinkle and water on top of his head. and bring him into that. THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD SAID. GOD HAS GOT A DIFFERENT WAY FROM THAT TO BRING THE PEOPLE INTO HIS CHURCH BY ONE SPIRIT. YOU DON'T say pastor is my friend, the minister is my friend. Just as friend as friendly can be that it does not make you part of the church. IT MAKES YOU PART OF DVF. THAT'S NOT PART OF THE CHURCH BY ONE SPIRIT. WE ALL BAPTIZE BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. GOD'S PROVIDED WAY OF BRINGING MEN INTO THE CHURCH BELIEVERS. HALLELUJAH. GOD ADDING TO THE CHURCH DAILY. God adding to the church. GOD don't do ANYTHING JUST means it for a purpose. THE BIBLE WASN'T PUT HERE JUST FOR MAN TO JUST look at it. SOME OF YOU WHEN YOU GET YOUR BIBLE START TO OPEN IT THE PAGES ARE STUCK TOGETHER. CHRISTIAN, YOU DON'T READ IT. BROTHER, YOU JUST LOOKING AT IT. You open Jeremiah 28. You are in Luke looking for Jeremiah. What's the matter with you? YOU JUST THE BIBLE WAS NOT PUT HERE JUST FOR A MAN TO and such brothers and sisters. They can cheat each other. They are best at arguing. EMPTY VESSELS MAKE A LOT OF NOISE JUST LOUD CHICK ignorant of the scripture. IT WAS NOT PUT HERE JUST TO LOOK AT IT first about it. THE BIBLE WAS PUT HERE FOR COLLECTION. TO turn that way. Fix this. FIX THAT. THERE'S A problem there. THERE'S A PROBLEM. WAKE UP OR RISE FROM IT'S A LIFE JUST TO BE LATE AND IT'S A ROAD MAP FROM IMMORTALITY. I don't KNOW WHERE YOU HEADING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIBLE. WHERE DO YOU SEE YOUR WHERE DO YOU SEE FROM or you ONLY SEE FROM SINGLE TO MARRIED from unemployment to EMPLOY from poor to RICH WHAT YOU SAYING IS TRUE BUT IT IS STILL SHALLOW. [Applause] YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THE ENTIRE TRIP. THAT'S ALL PART OF THE TRIP. BUT THE END OF IT HAS GOT TO BE MORTALITY. DWELLING IN AN APPROACHABLE LIGHT. Dwelling in an approachable light. We are talking ABOUT it shows you REMEMBER all the steps you have got. So that all of these STAKEHOLDERS must have one who call the stakeholders the stakeholders. That's that's THIS ROAD MAP. WHEN GOD BLESSED MEN HERE, THE UNFAILING REALITIES OF THE LIVING GOD, the unfailing realities of the living God. When God blessed MANY and in the days of the LORD JESUS, HE GAVE MEN. BROTHER, YOU HAVE GOT to be just follow and write type the words and spread it over there. A true road MAP to his power. HALLELUJAH. WHEN GOD BLESSED MEN HERE AND IN THE DAYS OF THE LORD JESUS, HE GAVE MEN THE TRUE ROAD MAP TO his power. What are you complaining about? Whom are you blaming? The problem is NOT YOUR WIFE. PROBLEM IS NOT YOUR HUSBAND. PROBLEM IS NOT THE PREACHER. YOU YOU YOURSELF HAS GOT TO BE that leads YOU TO THE POWER OF GOD. BROTHER, there's no blame game in Christianity. A ROAD MAP IS SOMETHING THAT TELLS YOU which way you are headed. It shows you which way YOU ARE HEADED. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE NOW. If we just find it in THE BIBLE, I will tell you where you are going to end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this road shows you where you are heading when we live in the He says, "When we live in THE NEXT FEW DAYS, I HAVE CROSSED this country. Crossed it SO MUCH. MY old wife and I were AMAZED TO THINK of it for the LAST FEW YEARS. YOU COULD mention where you want to go. Attention. Attention. WE WERE AMAZED FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. YOU COULD mention where you WANT TO GO. I can tell you and I can TELL YOU ANY ROAD THAT LEADS TO IT. I was say I was amazed. I realized THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHERE ARE YOU NOW? You go through here, there, and there, and then there. You say IT SAYS I CAN TELL YOU THE road that leads to it and within 15 MINUTES OF MY YOU WILL arrive from here to California. He had traveled it so much. He says I haven't missed it a time always my DIRECTIONS the directions I give it's just I've not missed it a time man traveled this country he says I don't know sometimes right on the dot calculating my time of what the driving time is and the average time. I have just been back and forth and up AND DOWN AND BACK AND FORTH TILL YOU JUST KNOW IT. THAT'S THE WAY GOD WANTS US TO KNOW HIS WORD. We know it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'VE JUST TRAVELED IT BACK AND FORTH, UP AND DOWN. The devil tells me which by which book are you going to read? It will be boring. You read it. I know it's a devil. No, no, NO. EVERY TIME I OPEN IT, IT'S THINGS UNFOLD. But listen, it says that's the way wants us to KNOW the way we know the ways. It is the way God wants us to know HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW YOU this way. YOU HAVE BEEN BACK AND FORTH. HE SAYS WE KNOW IT. We have traveled it. WE HAVE TESTED IT. YOU HAVE NOT GOT IT. He says we must know it and travel it and test it and TRY IT. YOU KNOW where it leads to. &gt;&gt; You just KNOW WHEN THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THIS IT MEANS THAT WHEN HE SAYS THAT IT means it says it's the road map IS BIBLE. THE BIBLE IS THE ROAD MAP THAT LEADS TO THE POWER OF GOD. HE SAYS HIS FAITH LEADS YOU TO THE POWER. POWER PRODUCES THE PROMISE. WE NEED THE POWER. BUT THE TAKE THE ROAD TO THE POWER IS THE BIBLE. AND FAITH IN THE BIBLE LEAD YOU TO THE POWER. AND THE POWER WILL GIVE YOU THE PROMISE. IN THE POWER IS THE HOLY SPIRIT. HALLELUJAH. [Applause] I don't know where you are getting whether you are getting this but I just want you to settle down be a Christian that is a self-contained a self-contained Christian that first DON'T DO THIS THE ROAD WHEN SATAN MET HIM, Satan tried to deter him. He It tried to deter the Lord Jesus. He got the road map. Satan did. And he said, you see here it says this year, cast yourself down. You know, Angels will come. It's here. It's here. [Music] There's a lots of bypasses. THERE'S A LOTS OF BYPASSES. LOTS of shortcuts. Don't take a bypass. Don't take a shortcut. You are in you are calling brothers. You are here. You are lying. You here MAKING YOU TAKING A SHORT PASS. I WILL BE around and act like them and shout me like it says there is a lots of bypasses this that or the other or as long as I do this That's not it. YOU HAVE GOT TO FIND GOD IN A PERSONAL RELATIONS and experience. &gt;&gt; Not to stay around AND JUST BE AROUND and just be AROUND &gt;&gt; and think this and think that. TRY THAT. YOU WILL FALL. IT'S YOU HAVE GOT TO KNOW GOD PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE. If you claim you have it and still LIVE FOR THE WORLD, THEN THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. THE DEVIL HAS DETERRED YOU ON A WRONG SCRIPTURE and you will suffocate. If we FOLLOW THE ROAD MAP, IF IT SAYS TURN ON THE SO SAYS HERE TURN THAT ACTS 238 SAYS REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS FOR THE REMISSION OF SIN. IT DIDN'T TURN LEFT. You must turn THAT WAY BECAUSE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS DONE THAT. I don't CARE HOW IT IS. YOU HAVE GOT TO FOLLOW THE ROAD. Oh brother, it's hard. Oh, brother. It's long. BROTHER, I DON'T CARE. FOLLOW THE ROAD. IF HE SAID THE PROMISES TO YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN, THAT DIDN'T MEAN FOR YEARS PAST AS MANY AS THE LORD OUR GOD is what it said. [Applause] Brother, it's hard to get the Holy Spirit. It is hard to get the Holy Spirit. [Music] We are not going to console you AND it is NOT WHEN YOU REPENT AND YOU'RE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS believe you WILL GET THE HOLY SPIRIT. IT SAYS THAT GOD IS YOU MUST FOLLOW IT. THE ROAD IS MARKED OUT. YOU CAN'T GET LOST. THE ROAD IS MARKED. IT IS MARKED. LISTEN. AND THOSE THAT WALK IN THAT ROAD. THEY ARE MARKED. I am marked. I AM MARKED. JUST WHEREVER I GO. AND I'M MOCKED. &gt;&gt; I USE THE SPIRIT TO DIVIDE. NO MORE. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And &gt;&gt; listen, it says the road is marked out. You can't say I followed and I got THERE'S NOWHERE TO GET LOST WITH THIS BLESSED old Bible. You say, "HOW WILL I KNOW THAT I AM ON IT? HOW WILL I KNOW THAT I'M ON THE RIGHT PATH? HOW WILL I KNOW THAT IT IS THE RIGHT THE RIGHT ROAD?" HE SAYS, "THE BLOOD FOOTPRINTS of the Lord JESUS made the road. HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO HALLELUJAH. THE PRAISE GOD THE FOOTPRINT OF THE LORD JESUS AND THE DISCIPLES laid on the same foundation. We will walk where the apostles ARE HONESTLY CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH WHICH WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINT. AND I SAY I PLEDGE ALLEGED on the same FOUNDATION AND THE HOLY SPIRIT directed them. [Applause] Hallelujah. It &gt;&gt; says the guide, THE GUIDE. IT SAYS THE HOLY SPIRIT directed them. FOLLOW THAT ROAD MAP. FOLLOW THAT ROAD MAP. FOLLOW THAT ROAD MAP. IT MAY BE A GREAT NEED. IT MAY BE A GREAT NEED. MAYBE THE DEBTS JUST TO DO HANGING ON YOU. IN THE ROAD MAP. THERE'S ONE THAT HAD A DEBT TO he said the credit HAS COME. &gt;&gt; THE CREDIT HAS COME. &gt;&gt; THE CREDIT HAS COME. BUT THERE WAS A ROAD MAP TO SORT OUT THE CREDIT. OH, GLORY. GLORY. HALLELUJAH. AND THEN HE SAYS WHEN THEY WERE CUTTING TREES, THE PROPHET ELISHA WAS THERE AND THIS MAN CUT THE TREE AND THE AX FELL IN THE WATER. It was BORROWED BUT recovery action. Have you invested Have YOU INVESTED AND BORROWED MONEY AND YOU HAVE LOST IT IN THE ROAD MAP TO RECOVER THAT BECAUSE IN THE ROAD MAP I HAVE SEEN IT say oh my lord IT WAS BORROWED AND THIS IS WHERE DID it fall a branch LET THE AXOT BROUGHT AGAIN IN THE NAME OF JESUS TROUBLE IN THE HOUSE TROUBLE IN THE HOUSE. THE WIFE IS ALL NERVOUS. THE CHILDREN ARE CRYING. OH, don't also get nervous. Don't also get THE PROPHET COMES IN. HE FIND sister ma. &gt;&gt; SHE'S THERE CRYING. HE SAYS she has she put that nervousness in the HOME and she was just crying and washing the dishes overwhelmed. THE CHILDREN ARE CRYING. THEY HAVE NOT EATEN IT. EVERYONE IS CONFUSED. And she says, "Oh, people are going in and out. Children have not eaten. Oh, it's too much." &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Now, I know Satan wants to guess get us all confused." But Lord, let my love of God, as he put his hand on her, go unto her. Then he says, "And may I help you to wash the dishes?" He says, "As I'm standing there, I'm praying while washing the dishes." Now, Lord, I know you are doing it. I know you ARE PUTTING EVERYTHING IN ORDER. AND BEFORE YOU KNOW, THE children started playing. Sister brought a story to talk AND HAPPINESS CAME BACK. IT SAYS IT'S THE ATMOSPHERE. Now that's in the road map. That's in THE ROAD MAP. SO IF IT IS TROUBLE IN YOUR HOME AND THE ROAD map shows you what IT took to GLORY AND YOU HOLD TO IT, BROTHER, THANK YOU to glory. WHERE HE IS RIGHT THERE. IF YOU ARE UNDER sin and it is overwhelming brother, this is a little bit different ones. It is not different. Don't tell us how big the difference. We tell you how big OUR PROBLEM, HOW BIG IS YOUR GOD, your problem will shrink. [Applause] DON'T TELL US HOW GREAT IS YOUR SIN. How great is the blood? JUST COME LIKE DAVID. YOU JUST COME LIKE DAVID. YOU JUST COME LIKE DAVID. AND HE SAID, "RESTORE UNTO ME THE joy of your soul AND RENEW A RIGHT SPIRIT within me." AND THERE COMES THE BLOOD. THERE COMES THE SPIRIT. AND you are RESTORED the virus to offend us. THIS BLOOD OF THE LORD JESUS KNOWS NO SIN. AND HE LOVES NO DEFEAT. &gt;&gt; IT CAN CLEANSE EVERYTHING. IF YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST, YOU CAN JUST NOT you come like that, I assure you, YOU ARE GOING BACK A CHRISTIAN. GOD WILL SURPRISE YOU. AND I SAID, "GOD, I have I said God." I have seen I've changed too much. I'm not what I used to be. Or sometimes I PREACH AND I JUST FEEL THE HAIR IS GOING OFF AND I'M ON THE STREET. I'M JUST NOT MYSELF AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND. But I don't have a place WHERE I CAN SAY IT WAS SUCH AND SUCH a such and such a time that I had an experience with you. I SAID GOD I DON'T HAVE THAT PLACE. [Music] MY LIFE IS DIFFERENT. I KNOW I'M JUST NOT WHAT I USED TO BE. I AM JUST EVERYONE SAYS I'M JUST A CHRISTIAN. BUT LORD, I DON'T HAVE that place. AND I cleaned the church. I said, I'm not eating today. I GAVE AWAY THE FOOD. AND AFTER CLEANING THE CHURCH, I ENTERED THERE AND I locked myself AND I SAID, "LORD, WHETHER TODAY SATURDAY ALL THE SAINTS ARE COMING, I WILL AGAIN COME BACK HERE AND ANOTHER DAY IF I DIE AND EXPERIENCE I PUT THE MESSAGE ON ALL THE SPEAKERS OF THE CHURCH. WHAT IS THE HOLY GHOST? WAS THE HOLY GHOST. I RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST. I GOT THE BIBLE. I FIND EVERY HOLY GHOST. I said, "LORD, I prayed till I could PRAY NO MORE." AND I SLEPT. I SAID, "I think it will be too many days, BUT I WILL NOT GO." AND I WOKE up at around midnight. I believe it was God that woke me up. AND I KNE DOWN AND I PRAYED again on my knees.

AND HE CAME AND HE TOOK ME UP. THAT WAS NOTHING. THE DEVIL CAN'T TAKE it away. SOMETHING WITHIN ME TOLD ME. NOTHING CAN TAKE THIS AWAY FROM YOU. I THINK I'LL TAKE AWAY THAT.

[Music] [Applause] GOD WILL SURPRISE THE YOU MAY think it will BE TOO MANY TIMES. IT WON'T BE TOO MANY DAYS. YOUR BREAKTHROUGH WILL COME TODAY. YOU MAY THINK IT WILL BE TOO MANY DAYS FOR YOUR ANSWER TO COME. BUT IT IS TODAY THAT THE ANSWER COMES. YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW surpris [Music] Oh brother, that man said, "Lord, if you don't give me the Holy Ghost, you will find my bones in this garden of God. When you COME BACK AND WHEN I MEET THE LORD, I DIED BECAUSE YOU DID GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST." PROBLEM SAY I WILL eat this portion AND PIECE. IF I DIE, I WILL TELL GOD I DIED BECAUSE I TRUSTED YOU. AND JOB SAID THOUGH HE SLAYS ME YET WILL I TRUST YOU BECAUSE I KNOW MY REDEEMER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday IS BOUND TO RESPOND JUST THE SAME. JUST THE SAME. Just the same. Just the same. I RESPONDED. BROTHER JULIUS, &gt;&gt; I HAVE TOILED ALL NIGHT. I have applied everywhere. I have APPLIED EVERYWHERE. I have prayed AND FASTED. BUT THERE IS NO CATCH. He says launch into the deep. AFTER HE PUTS HIS HAND IN THE WATER AND THE HAND OF GOD. THE HAND OF GOD COME UPON YOU AND RECEIVE YOUR ANSWERED PRAYER IN THE NAME OF JESUS. YOU SAY MY brothers are too heavy. These bills ARE TOO HEAVY. I HAVE A ROAD map that the God we have is a Jehovah. You say, "Brother, I PLEDGE THEE BY INSPIRATION, BUT NOW I FEEL IT TOO MUCH. OH BROTHER, THE LORD WILL PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF if it IS OF THE LORD. HE PROVIDED FOR HIS OWN FROM THAT TIME. HE SAYS THE LORD JESUS WHEN HE WAS PREACHING THE GOSPEL UNTO THE people there came a time John 6 there that he laid down the gospel in John 6 and they started leaving him and because they DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHO BROUGHT HIM BACK. THE ROAD MAP EXPLAINED ABOUT THE MIRACLES. They didn't see that it also explained THE GOSPEL in its entirety. IT says they left HIM AND FROM THAT TIME HIS POPULARITY BEGIN TO decrease it down. He wasn't the same one then. HE SAYS AND JUST LIKE A modern preacher, SOMEBODY IF THEY SAY WHY, &gt;&gt; wait a minute here, you are offending the people with your preaching. YOU MUST NOT DO THAT. NOW A MODERN preacher would say, "OH YES, MAYBE I would better watch. I would better watch what the CR says. I better watch what the company says. I better watch what my friends say. Maybe I would better look to see what the church says about turn ME DOWN. THE CHURCH MAY TURN YOU DOWN. BUT GOD WON'T TURN YOU DOWN. THE FRIENDS MAY TURN YOU DOWN. BUT GOD WON'T TURN YOU DOWN. THE BOSS MAY TURN YOU DOWN. BUT GOD IS YOUR BOSS. THAT wasn't our Lord. Our Lord came to do the will OF GOD. HE FOLLOWED WHAT? AND ANYBODY WITH GOD IN HIM FOLLOW THE SAME WAY THE what did did he stop? NO SIR YET HIS POPULARITY BECAME ALL THE TIME DIDN'T WALK WITH HIM. THEY WENT AWAY FROM HIM. THE NEXT CHAPTER SOME TURNED NO MORE. They went out from him. He says, "WHERE WAS HE AT? ON THE ROAD TO CAL AND WHERE ARE WE AT ON THE ROAD TO GLORY?" Many may turn their back on the message. Say this and do that. But brother, I'M STAYING ON THE ROAD. I'VE SEEN IT all the way through. HE SAYS IT NEVER STOP. OR COMPROMISED WITH GOD'S word straight on down the highway. Now don't sleep. I'm just getting to cut just sober on THE ROAD MAP. THERE WAS A ROAD set before him. That's the road you must every born again Christian as the road set before GOD TO follow that road. God marks it out. It's marked by the BLOOD and the spirit ALWAYS LIVES IN THE BLOOD. BECAUSE THROUGH THE BLOOD COMES LIFE blood cell is the life WE FOLLOW HIM. WE SEE how the road map directs us. SHOWS WHICH WAY WE ARE GOING. It is always been God's provided WAY FOR US. THE WORD IS GOD'S PROVIDED WAY. Be it marriage, be it a job, be it ministry, be it family, whatever, whatever, WHATEVER. This is God is provided me the present state of my ministry. one of our deacons here. I don't know where he is here tonight. It's Tony Zabel is USUAL AROUND HERE AND HE CAME to me and HE SAID HERE NOT LONG ago he said I had a dream a FUNNY DREAM. I dreamt I was trying to find my way upward toward heaven. HE SAID, "I seen a man coming with a black robe on." He was reading a book and he said, "I got this man." And I said TO HIM, "WHICH WAY to heaven?" AND HE SAID, "ASK THE MAN AHEAD OF ME." That was a pastor of a church that he had went to. He went a LITTLE FURTHER AND HE MET another man. He had on a black robe and he was singing songs GOING ON. THAT WAS ANOTHER PASTOR. IT'S LIKE YOU GOING from church to church, body to man of God, brother to brother, sister, BOTH THEM PASTORS ARE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE, fine men. And he said to him, which way DO I GET UP TO THE TOP OF MOUNTAIN? He said, "Look here, standing way up there on the top that little bitty guy." He said, "There stood a guy with a pair of overalls, wearing a little cowboy hat. You think it's about what he wears? You think it's about the clothes? He says, "There is a guy with a little pair of over wearing a little cowboy hat." Someone said, "That one doesn't look like a preacher. Looks like a farmer." said that it was me standing up there and he climbed up till he got to me. I got him by the arm and led him on up till I got on top of the hill. Listen, listen. AND THERE WAS A wilderness &gt;&gt; to go through. That's a place of trials. LISTEN. AND I SAID, TONY, I MUST LEAVE YOU HERE AND YOU MUST WALK SOME OF THIS BY YOURSELF. TOOK HIS HAND. He took his hand. Took him and took him up to somewhere. He told me this is where I leave you. You must walk alone. Who are you going to walk with? [Music] My mother, my father and my brother and carry me. There will be a moment that he will leave you somewhere. Not that he wants to, but there has got TO BE A TIME WHEN YOU MUST WALK some of this by YOURSELF because God does not keep baby Christian. HE SAID, "BROTHER, BROTHER, WHAT CAN I DO FROM HERE ON? WHAT SHOULD I DO?" I SAID, COME HERE, TONY. &gt;&gt; Look down there. You see them barefooted tracks [Music] WITH BLOOD IN THEM. I SAID, THAT'S WHAT I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL the way. Brother is here no more. BROTHER IS NOT HERE ANYMORE. I WISH THERE SOMEONE WHO could you never knew then brother brother if you are like that he says JUST LOOK OVER THERE that's the bloody FOOTPRINTS OF THE FACTS OF JESUS THAT'S WHAT FOLLOWED ALL [Applause] THAT'S THE ONLY THING I KNOW &gt;&gt; TO POINT man to not a sensation SOME SORT BUT TO THOSE BLOOD that leads TO THE BIBLE THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on brother. He says you have got to walk some of this. WHAT CAN I DO FROM HERE? Just look over there. Just see the bloody fruit. Amen. I wish Paul was young. I wish I was in those days. I wish my husband did. I wish my wife I wish I WISH MY FATHER DID NOT DO THAT. I wish I was born of a parent. I WISH MY PARENTS were rich. I WISH OF MINE HAD a job like this that's not that's not just follow the blood of CHRIST when a man comes to a spot brother when you just get into contact with HIM just somewhere right off there anchored in Christ God His problem is the Holy Spirit. GOD IS PROVIDED OF DOING THINGS. It just has got to be God. THAT'S THE GOD'S ROAD map out THAT WILL TAKE YOU up there. If Satan Satan sometimes if he can't make people keep the truth, he can't keep them away FROM THE TRUTH. HE MAKES THEM FANATICS. Throw them off in this side and they get all kind of stuff and and unscripture THINGS BUT STAY ON THE BLUEPRINT. STAY ON THE HIGHWAY. STAY WITH THE SCRIPTURE. DON'T LEAVE IT. THAT'S WHY JESUS COME not deceived. Stay on the highway. STAY ON THE ROAD. GO THE WAY THE disciples went. Go the word they preached. Believe it. TESTIFY. I KNOW IT TO be the truth. SIGNS IN THE LAST DAYS. GOD living in man. It's God is a program. GOD HAS TO FIND somebody that he can trust. SOMEBODY THAT HE CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN can have confidence IN GOD. SOMEONE that can believe him. You he says easy is confidence. YOU SURE BELIEVE THAT YOU HE SAYS GOD HAS TO FIND someone whom he can put his and when he finds such he can PUT HIS CONFIDENCE IN. AND HIS POWER in that MAN THAT WILL FOLLOW THE road that will stay on THE MAP right on till he comes to the place of power. Not this little bit chicken brother, little bitty coward. He says someone that can come and follow till he comes to the place of power. Faith will lead him to that BECAUSE HE HAS GOT FAITH IN THE WORD. It will relate HIM TO THE PROMISE AND IT WILL LEAD HIM TO THE POWER AND POWER will lead him to the promise. When he gets to the promise and he begins to manifest the promise, what does it do? IT BLINDS THE EYES of the unbelieving lukewarming brother. How how has he done it? Probably he's a he's a con man. He's not a real Christian. He's just making himself up. &gt;&gt; Someone is manifesting THE PROMISE. FOLLOWED THE ROAD MAP TILL IT GOT to the presence. THEY START TO WALK IN THE PROMISE. THEY START TO WALK IN THE PROMISE and the LUKEWARM SERVING BROTHER is blinded. THAT'S exactly right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm just done over here. Just done. It says a man that will follow that law. I need the power. I need God. I need to seek this man that will continue in a road map will someday come to the place of power where I will begin to manifest the promise. JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THE road map. Just keep following that road map. YOU ARE NOT LOST. YOU ARE NOT ON A WRONG PATH. YOU ARE just on the right path. Brother, brother, brother, sister, if you just do what they did, just you can just even stand on your feet now. We preach together. because I've done over here. IF YOU JUST FOLLOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID, he says that's why I think erranous [Applause] &gt;&gt; that's in the Samaranian church age. &gt;&gt; I think erranous &gt;&gt; because he had the same faith that Paul and the disciples had handed down. Why I believe that he was the ANGEL OF THE CHURCH of Samaria? Because he had the same scripture teachings on the basis of God's word. It says, it will produce the same thing every time. Whether it's a young man that takes an old man. IF THEY FOLLOW JUST right that THE OTHER FOLLOWED TO GET THE PROMISE, it will produce the same thing. If you will JUST SIMPLY TAKE GOD'S FILM FORMULA [Applause] I JUST WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS secret because we have NOW COME TO AN emergency situations which are here. The conditions WHICH ARE HERE COME WITH A NEED. You came with a desire. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM AND TROUBLE IS UPON YOU. IF YOU WILL JUST SIMPLY TAKE GOD'S FORMULA AND CARRY IT OUT to the letter. NO MATTER WHAT THE CHURCHES SAY, what the neighbor say, what the other family say, AND YOU JUST FOLLOW THAT WORD, just the way it IS SAID, it will produce the same thing. THAT'S WHAT that's what he did. Ah, close your eyes brother. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Now we are addressing now your CONDITIONED SITUATION. NOT HERE TO HERE TO FIGHT. WE HERE TO PUT DOWN. WE ARE HERE TO DEFEAT THE DEVIL BECAUSE WE ARE BORN FOR THAT. WE COME INTO THE WORLD FOR THIS. But the scripture might be fulfilled. Remember what he says. &gt;&gt; He says IF I JUST TAKE THE ROAD MAP and just follow the marker, I am bound to come there. It may take me wrong to my thinking. Everyone, I want you to CLOSE YOUR EYES. JUST HELP ME. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. God is now God is now the one controlling. It's not you, it's not us. He says if you take God's ro has been provided it may not it may look different to your THINKING BUT JUST GO THAT WAY BECAUSE THE SIGN IS appointing that you will arrive [Music] That's the way with the road to heaven. We have our own thinking. The word your need your answer YOUR OWN THINKING. YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. MAYBE THIS WAY THAT WAY UNTIL YOUR mind is almost like blowing because you are trying to TAKE IT YOUR WAY. WE HAVE OUR OWN thinking but if we use WE ARE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES ALL TOGETHER WRONG. You will become wrecked somewhere. But if you take the way THAT GOD HAS MARKED OUT YOU WILL ARRIVE JUST AS YOU BECAUSE THAT'S GOD'S WAY. Come on MY BROTHER. WHAT'S YOUR NEED? [Music] THINK HOW long we have come in the presence of God. We know the road map says all things are possible to them. JESUS SAYS, "I AM THE way which is true and it leads to life. It's by faith that we do anything. What is it, brother? We want to lift UP NOW. GET YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY. JESUS IS HERE. IT'S NOT AN IDOL TALK. The promise of God is true.

What is standing in your way? &gt;&gt; Come on my sister. Come on my brother. &gt;&gt; You can BREAK IT RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE THE POWER.
