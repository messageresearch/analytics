[8:16] in this service today I'd like you to
[8:19] really
[8:20] um
[8:23] put on like brother Barnum would say
[8:25] your spiritual thinking okay
[8:27] um
[8:36] in the beginning was the word and the
[8:39] Word was with God and the Word was God
[8:47] the same was in the beginning with God
[8:53] is that a man should
[8:55] now I would like all of us to read verse
[8:57] 14 together
[9:02] and the Word was made manifest
[9:06] and let us read it again and the Word
[9:08] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[9:13] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[9:17] only begotten of the father full of
[9:20] grace and truth
[9:22] so the word was made flesh
[9:26] is
[9:35] so in the beginning was
[9:44] God the word was
[9:48] so what is the word
[9:52] God is the one
[9:54] and verse 14 says
[9:58] and
[9:59] the word
[10:01] was made flesh
[10:05] so remember what is the word
[10:09] now I want you to to to to to read it
[10:13] that way and
[10:15] God katonda was made flesh
[10:21] so in other words
[10:23] Jesus yes was not some other man that
[10:28] came out of nowhere
[10:30] it was the word which was in the
[10:32] beginning with God
[10:35] and now was made fleshura
[10:43] so I'm going to speak to you on the
[10:45] subject of the unrecognized Christ
[10:51] on Wednesday brother brother
[10:55] Andrew spoke on recognizing your
[10:58] promises
[11:03] and so
[11:05] the word recognizing is coming again to
[11:07] us today
[11:10] even Jesus was before the birth of Jesus
[11:17] the Jews knew the prophecies about his
[11:22] birth
[11:25] the Jews believed in the Messiah
[11:29] the Jews believe the Messiah would be
[11:32] born
[11:34] and when the Messiah would come
[11:37] he would have several characteristics
[11:42] so they believed in the messiah's coming
[11:47] stay hard and believed the prophecies
[11:52] one of the prophets and that is Isaiah
[11:56] in the book of Isaiah chapter 61 and you
[11:59] can turn it there today we are going to
[12:01] read quite a lot of scriptures so if you
[12:02] have your pain and and Bible you can
[12:04] knock those things down and and then go
[12:07] back to it after correctness
[12:14] in verse 1 of 61 of Isaiah
[12:20] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[12:23] because the Lord has anointed me to
[12:26] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has
[12:29] set me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[12:31] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[12:33] opening of the prison to them that
[12:35] abound
[12:36] tomorrow
[12:39] [Music]
[12:46] is
[13:07] now this prophecy was given by prophet
[13:10] Isaiah before the New Testament
[13:15] that the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[13:18] because he has anointed me to preach the
[13:21] Good Tidings
[13:25] and this prophecy was speaking on the
[13:28] coming of Jesus
[13:31] who would have the spirit of God upon
[13:33] him
[13:36] area would actually bind the we would
[13:40] actually bring Good Tidings to the
[13:43] makeup
[13:45] he would bind the Brokenhearted
[13:49] Proclaim everybody to the captives
[13:52] this was the ministry of the Messiah
[13:56] if you understand that say Amen
[13:59] now in Isaiah
[14:02] is
[14:05] I want you to look at that prophecy
[14:08] again
[14:09] praise the name of the Lord
[14:17] For unto us a child is born and to us a
[14:21] son is given and the government shall be
[14:23] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[14:26] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[14:28] God the vasting Father the Prince of
[14:29] Peace
[14:48] now this prophecy was also given by
[14:51] Isaiah speaking on the coming of the
[14:53] Messiah
[14:55] [Music]
[14:57] are you following me
[15:00] you really have to say Amen in this
[15:01] service
[15:03] because if you don't you will does I can
[15:05] assure you
[15:06] know because you need to really put on
[15:09] your spiritual thinking
[15:15] as a child is born
[15:18] and to us a son is given oh man
[15:22] who was this son this was the Messiah
[15:26] that was for to come
[15:27] [Music]
[15:30] he says his name would be called
[15:32] wonderful
[15:36] the Mighty God the Everlasting father
[15:40] the Prince of Peace
[15:47] praise the name of Lord now I want you
[15:50] to follow this
[15:52] the Jews had this script
[15:55] the Jews believe in the description the
[15:59] Jews followed
[16:00] they read it every time in their
[16:02] synagogues
[16:05] but when the time for Jesus to be born
[16:07] came
[16:09] they never recognized him they did not
[16:13] even understand
[16:15] Jesus was the Messiah
[16:17] do you know why they didn't understand
[16:19] that brother somewhere
[16:21] because the Messiah was supposed to be
[16:24] nothing less than God
[16:31] knew the Messiah had to be God
[16:34] you know as I will show you in the Bible
[16:37] in the Book of John
[16:39] Jesus told them the Jews that he was a
[16:42] Son of God yes
[16:44] and they wanted to stun him immediately
[16:47] do you know the reason they gave him um
[16:59] he told them he was the son of God
[17:02] but they claimed he said he was God
[17:06] because they knew to be a Son of God
[17:09] it meant you had to be God himself
[17:15] are you following me this morning
[17:17] they read this scripture in their
[17:19] temples
[17:21] synagogues for years and years
[17:26] and on the day when Jesus was born
[17:38] they did not understand
[17:40] that the Messiah was born
[17:44] as a matter of fact only a few
[17:46] understood
[17:53] was one of them
[17:58] was one of them
[18:00] you know and we also find that the the
[18:04] Shepherds
[18:05] you know these were people who were
[18:07] despised
[18:09] the lowest of the people they are the
[18:13] ones who understood and recognized the
[18:14] birth of
[18:20] [Music]
[19:13] you see that this waste man anybody
[19:16] never said that again because of a nice
[19:17] day
[19:18] they realize that the Stars was leading
[19:22] them to the Messiah
[19:24] and they followed that stuff until they
[19:28] reached
[19:30] and they worship
[19:32] the king never recognized the priest the
[19:36] religious man never understood
[19:38] now if if those great people of that
[19:41] time did not recognize Christ
[19:44] [Music]
[19:45] I want to ask you a question do you
[19:49] think they will recognize Christ today
[19:53] the religious men are said there are not
[19:55] the Bishops back upon the mighty
[19:58] powerful the theologians you don't
[20:01] recognize Christ that way
[20:04] Christ reveals himself to babies such as
[20:07] can learn
[20:11] are you a baby
[20:18] so you can be able to recognize Christ
[20:22] now we need to understand that the Word
[20:24] was God to take it into it
[20:27] so God was made flesh
[20:34] this is the most powerful Revelation in
[20:37] the Bible
[20:40] hallelujah amen even Jesus himself he
[20:44] said he's going to build his church
[20:47] on the revelation of Christ
[20:50] because Jesus one day asked his disciple
[20:53] foreign
[20:55] [Music]
[21:06] [Music]
[21:13] [Music]
[21:25] foreign
[22:56] in the beginning was the what foreign
[23:05] [Music]
[23:10] God became man
[23:12] too that you might become him I want to
[23:14] go for okay Hallelujah
[23:16] [Music]
[23:18] now turn to your Bible in the Book of
[23:19] John chapter four because
[23:25] verses 24.
[23:27] God is a spirit and they that worship
[23:30] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[23:32] truth is
[23:40] the name of the Lord God is
[23:47] the spirit moyo is like water
[23:54] what is this chichino
[23:56] must how many water amazing
[24:01] one water okay we will find out how many
[24:05] it is
[24:08] okay how many disagree
[24:12] it's all right it's okay to disagree
[24:14] okay do you see this is what is
[24:17] happening
[24:21] that confusion
[24:23] it is
[24:36] how many water is this
[24:39] if this is
[24:41] how many water is this
[24:47] do you see the confusion
[24:51] the other one will even come and you
[24:55] know
[24:56] they will come and with red face yes and
[24:59] he will say no don't you have knowledge
[25:01] in your head don't take it that way this
[25:04] is one water two water
[25:08] it is
[25:14] there is two yeah when you said the
[25:16] studio you're right
[25:18] but what you said is true water you are
[25:20] wrong
[25:22] because the water is
[25:24] but also that water which is
[25:28] not one like your finger is
[25:32] that right it is more than one
[25:36] but not
[25:38] foreign
[26:08] it can be in this mother today guys
[26:13] and in another kind of bottle
[26:16] the bottles may be so many babies but
[26:20] you cannot say it is one water
[26:22] but you can say it's the same water yes
[26:28] and because it's the same word
[26:31] that's where the word Oneness comes
[26:34] it is
[26:42] it can be in many places at the same
[26:45] time in
[26:50] Uganda
[26:51] as a matter of fact that water is in you
[26:54] and it is
[27:06] the same word
[27:43] where that water is
[27:47] and that is how the spirit is the Bible
[27:51] says God is a spirit
[27:54] you cannot count the spirit
[27:57] the spirit is in heaven
[28:00] it's in America
[28:04] but how many is it
[28:08] same experience
[28:11] Hallelujah if that same spirit that
[28:15] raised Christ from the dead yes
[28:17] [Music]
[28:24] [Music]
[28:29] it's not a different spirit it's the
[28:33] same same Spirit
[28:34] one day he came in a field of clouds
[28:40] one day you came and he says
[28:56] but he is
[29:10] foreign
[29:42] and then another one says
[29:46] divided in three parts
[29:51] so is one divided in three parts
[30:03] so what about God the father in which
[30:07] form is
[30:16] confusion
[30:17] is the same God who manifested himself
[30:22] in three different forms
[30:26] the Greek word is
[30:31] God changing his form
[30:38] God manifesting himself
[30:57] and you can never count him
[31:01] praise the name of the Lord
[31:04] hallelujah hallelujah now
[31:09] foreign
[31:25] foreign
[31:36] [Music]
[32:26] [Music]
[32:38] each of them is
[32:43] each of them is a is a is the spirit but
[32:48] each of them
[32:49] is not the other one Buddhism
[32:59] each of them is
[33:03] conduction
[34:03] foreign
[34:23] [Music]
[34:44] foreign
[35:22] so there is something that you need to
[35:24] understand
[35:26] so the Oneness teaching is wrong
[35:31] and that's why they go ahead to baptize
[35:35] in the name of Jesus
[35:38] they actually they call them Jesus only
[35:40] people yes we don't believe that to kill
[35:44] us and I find that many Believers of
[35:47] this message actually don't understand
[35:48] that
[35:51] they get mixed up there now our Prophet
[35:55] is telling us here but the trinidadians
[35:59] mixed it up
[36:01] and the Oneness people also mix it up
[36:06] I said God is not one like a finger is
[36:09] one cartoon
[36:12] those two groups got it mixed up I'm
[36:15] always
[36:17] you can't make it either way
[36:23] you put for me these quotes here this is
[36:26] a very sensitive subject
[36:28] now he says he was God
[36:32] manifested in a flesh
[36:36] of his creative foreign
[37:48] foreign
[38:08] [Music]
[39:15] [Music]
[39:33] he created everything
[39:54] all right now I want you to go to
[39:57] uh-huh
[40:04] First Corinthians
[40:07] chapter 15.
[40:13] foreign
[40:25] these are all very wonderful nuggets but
[40:27] okay let's continue but every man in his
[40:30] own order verse 23 Christ the first
[40:32] fruits afterward they that are Christ is
[40:34] at his coming then cometh the end when
[40:38] shall when he shall have delivered up
[40:41] the kingdom to God even the father when
[40:44] he shall have put down all Rule and all
[40:48] authority and power for he Jesus must
[40:51] Reign till so that is an end to his
[40:54] reigning till he has put all enemies
[40:57] under his feet The Last Enemy that shall
[41:00] be destroyed is death for he has put all
[41:03] things under his feet but when he shall
[41:05] have all things uh when he shall when he
[41:08] says all things are put under him it is
[41:10] Manifest that he is expected which did
[41:13] put all things under him that is in
[41:15] Christ Jesus and when all things shall
[41:18] be subdued unto him the then shall
[41:21] discern
[41:23] also himself be subject unto him that
[41:28] put all things under him that God may be
[41:30] all in all
[41:31] ah
[41:36] [Music]
[41:39] Christ is

[48:43] [Music]
[48:54] [Music]
[49:22] [Music]
[49:49] [Music]
[50:13] he has now come back
[50:17] in the form of the Holy Spirit
[50:43] that's why the name of Jesus
[50:45] must still be used
[50:48] without the name of Jesus
[51:33] [Music]
[51:49] Hallelujah
[52:21] [Music]
[52:39] he divided himself

[52:45] but in Christ he was there yeah he
[52:49] walked in his foreign
[52:51] [Music]
[53:19] praise the name of the Lord the Bible
[53:22] says that he was the fullness of God had
[53:23] bought it again
[53:27] does it mean heaven was empty
[53:31] God was still in heaven but God was in
[53:34] Jesus Christ in his fullness
[53:42] let me ask you a question to you who I
[53:44] hear can't understand that
[53:47] was Jesus God in the pill of Fire

[54:16] what about the crowd
[54:19] was it God yeah
[54:23] now you're thinking
[54:24] that's very nice this is the truth now
[54:27] God katonda is a spirit he's not
[54:31] anything visible
[54:35] but the spirit
[54:37] manifests himself
[54:39] invisible thing moving
[54:42] the visible things
[54:44] can pass away big wow but that God
[54:48] invisible but remains and he continues
[54:53] manifest himself
[55:00] now
[55:01] God the spirit came down in the field of
[55:04] fire
[55:07] came down in a body yeah
[55:15] foreign
[55:20] [Music]

[56:18] but when God was born in a man
[56:23] from that day
