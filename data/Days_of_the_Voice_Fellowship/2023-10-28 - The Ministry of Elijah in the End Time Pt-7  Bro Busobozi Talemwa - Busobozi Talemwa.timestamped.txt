[0:02] so I would like to greet the Saints at
[0:04] evening on
[0:08] zoom in the name of our Lord
[0:11] Jesus so if you can all turn with me to
[0:14] Second Kings chapter
[0:26] 4 and we have already uh spoken on the
[0:31] ministry of Elijah in the end
[0:37] time and we've been speaking on this
[0:40] subject for quite a while
[0:45] now but to the Saints on Zoom I left up
[0:48] uh I left on somewhere I just it will
[0:50] just be a
[0:55] continuation and for all of us even here
[0:57] at the the
[0:58] church
[1:00] it will be a
[1:03] continuation and uh just I have a few
[1:05] things that I have on my heart to speak
[1:07] to
[1:09] you may the Lord
[1:12] just you know give us inspiration to
[1:16] speak we are reading from vers
[1:22] 32 and we shall read up to vers
[1:27] 36 I'll read verse by verse with my
[1:29] brother
[1:33] and when Elisha was come into the house
[1:35] behold the
[1:37] child was dead and laid upon his
[1:41] [Music]
[1:49] bed and went in there and shut the door
[1:52] upon um and he went in there and shut
[1:57] the door upon them Twain and prayed unto
[1:59] the the
[2:02] [Music]
[2:04] Lord and he went up and lay upon the
[2:06] child and put his mouth upon his mouth
[2:09] and his eyes upon his eyes and his hand
[2:12] upon his hand and he stretched himself
[2:14] upon the child and the Flesh of the
[2:16] child Works
[2:28] warm
[2:32] [Music]
[2:34] then he returned and walked in the house
[2:36] to and fr and went up and stretched
[2:39] himself upon the
[2:40] child upon him and the child sneezed
[2:43] seven times and the child opened his
[2:58] eyes
[3:00] and he called
[3:02] gazi and he called gazi this is verse 36
[3:07] and said call this shunamite so he
[3:10] called her and when he was come in unto
[3:13] him he and when she was come in unto him
[3:17] he said take up thy
[3:28] son
[3:32] amen let us pray father we commit
[3:35] ourselves to you at this
[3:38] moment Lord may you give me
[3:41] utterance may you just give Grace to us
[3:44] tonight for we do not know how to
[3:47] speak but may you give us utterance Lord
[3:51] give us inspiration father people that
[3:53] are listening to
[3:54] us oh God for these are the purches of
[3:58] your blood I pray that you reveal
[4:00] yourself to them that amen for your
[4:04] purpose that they will hear
[4:07] tonight you open their eyes of
[4:09] understanding and may they see the
[4:11] deeper things of God in Jesus name amen
[4:16] amen you may be
[4:18] seated I'm speaking to you today on the
[4:21] ministry of Elijah in the end time part
[4:26] seven and maybe for a little inspiration
[4:29] tonight
[4:31] a little at the seventh time
[4:38] sneeze amen at the seventh time
[4:43] sneeze so I want to say that we have
[4:45] established from all these things we've
[4:48] been looking
[4:51] at so we have established that the Bible
[4:54] teaches on the five comings of
[4:58] Elijah
[5:01] the first time Elijah
[5:03] came that was elah
[5:06] the and and and we've seen everything
[5:09] that Elijah the
[5:12] did he was
[5:14] anointed he was a prophet of
[5:16] restoration he rose the a child from the
[5:20] dead you know his ministry brought
[5:23] restored
[5:24] food restored life restored you know the
[5:28] power of God
[5:30] brought down
[5:32] rain you know went against the false
[5:36] prophets that was the first coming of
[5:40] Elijah and and the second time we see
[5:43] Elijah's
[5:46] Ministry in
[5:49] elishah because Elisha received a double
[5:51] portion of the spirit which was upon
[5:57] Elijah so now I want to say it this way
[6:01] when we say the spirit of
[6:04] Elijah we do not really mean Elijah
[6:07] incarnating other
[6:13] people we are meaning that the spirit of
[6:16] God which was working upon
[6:21] Elijah in the nature that he
[6:25] worked he continued working again on
[6:28] other
[6:32] other
[6:34] Generations the second time It Came Upon
[6:37] elishah and when you see the ministry of
[6:41] Elisha listen the ministry of Elisha is
[6:43] really I can say a duplicate of the
[6:47] ministry of
[6:51] [Music]
[6:52] Elijah everything Elijah
[6:55] did is what Elijah had done
[7:00] but in a double
[7:03] portion so that's the second
[7:05] time we see Elijah's Ministry the third
[7:09] time we see Elijah's
[7:11] Ministry is through the ministry of John
[7:14] the
[7:16] Baptist now when John the Baptist came
[7:18] they did not know who who uh who he
[7:24] represented they asked him who he was
[7:28] and he said I'm the voice from the
[7:29] Wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[7:34] Lord make his path
[7:37] straight so John the Baptist
[7:40] again when Jesus came he said he was the
[7:44] Elijah which was for to
[7:47] [Music]
[7:48] come in many denominational
[7:52] circles they believe that John the
[7:55] Baptist was the one to finish the
[7:58] ministry of Elijah
[8:03] they understand listen they understand
[8:04] that
[8:06] John had the spirit of Elijah on
[8:09] him and they actually think that that
[8:12] Ministry ends with
[8:15] John but I want to tell you tonight the
[8:18] ministry of Elijah continues on after
[8:23] John because John
[8:26] only fulfilled his portion
[8:30] of preparing the coming of the
[8:34] Lord turning the hearts of the fathers
[8:36] to the
[8:39] children which were the
[8:41] Jews previously not knowing Jesus
[8:45] Christ so the ministry of John prepared
[8:48] their
[8:49] hearts to receive the
[8:52] Messiah but you see the Bible says he
[8:55] was in the his ministry was in the power
[8:57] and spirit of Elijah
[9:03] but the people never
[9:05] understood at the time before the coming
[9:07] of the
[9:09] Messiah the people never understood that
[9:11] the ministry of
[9:13] John was actually in the power and
[9:16] spirit of
[9:18] Elijah they missed it and because they
[9:21] missed it they also missed the coming of
[9:24] the
[9:26] Messiah when the Messiah came they never
[9:29] understood who he
[9:31] was why because they missed
[9:34] John when you miss the coming of
[9:37] Elijah you will miss the coming of the
[9:41] Messiah Elijah's Ministry only comes to
[9:45] prepare the people's hearts to receive
[9:47] the
[9:49] Messiah and so we found that John the
[9:52] Baptist was that
[9:56] Elijah his name was John
[9:59] but his ministry was in the nature and
[10:01] in the spirit and in the power of
[10:06] Elijah if you understand that say
[10:09] amen and then we see Elijah comes the
[10:12] fourth
[10:13] time you see the fourth time now is is
[10:17] coming to the
[10:19] Gentiles and we notice that this was
[10:22] William
[10:24] Bram now I trust that all of you believe
[10:28] that some of you don't believe that
[10:30] William Bram was the fourth
[10:34] Elijah we can have another service to
[10:36] prove that to
[10:38] you but today we want to to also go on
[10:41] that line a little
[10:44] bit to prove to you why William Branham
[10:47] why this age has received William
[10:50] Branham who is actually the fourth
[10:56] El and why in the end time
[11:00] so I say that unequivocally without any
[11:06] doubt was the fourth
[11:09] Elijah that is without any
[11:12] debate and if you agree with me you can
[11:14] say
[11:15] Amen praise God but that is to the
[11:20] Gentiles we are coming back to that just
[11:23] hold that for a moment and then we
[11:25] notice that the fifth time Elijah
[11:27] comes
[11:29] he comes now to the
[11:32] Jews and in Revelation
[11:35] 11 the Bible speaks of two
[11:38] witnesses it says that one of them had
[11:41] the power to turn water into
[11:46] blood that is
[11:48] Moses and then the other one he had
[11:51] power to call fire from
[11:53] heaven so that is the the ministry of
[11:57] Elijah so we notice that the
[11:59] Jews will also receive the ministry of
[12:02] Elijah
[12:05] again but that will be after the
[12:11] Rapture and therefore that is not our
[12:16] ministry that Ministry is not really
[12:20] about the
[12:22] Gentiles is coming after the
[12:26] Rapture for the Salvation of the 44,000
[12:33] Jews but for now where are we we are
[12:38] right here at the coming of the fourth
[12:42] Elijah now listen to me oh the five
[12:45] comings of
[12:47] Elijah really benefit the
[12:51] Jews except for the fourth
[12:54] one William Bram went from America
[12:59] and he was going to go to
[13:02] Israel but do you know what the Holy
[13:04] Spirit stopped
[13:06] him God spoke to him when he was up in
[13:09] the
[13:11] air and told him don't you do
[13:14] that don't you go there why don't you
[13:19] understand that William BR you know you
[13:22] have to go and find that
[13:24] video they interviewed him and they
[13:27] asked him whether he thinks that he his
[13:31] ministry will be received in
[13:34] Israel he believed yes he said yes I
[13:38] believe he said because the Bible says
[13:41] the the Greeks seek after
[13:44] wisdom and the Jews seek after
[13:47] signs and the ministry of William Bram
[13:50] was that Anointed with the Min with with
[13:53] the spirit of
[13:56] Elijah to do signs and wonders
[13:59] to call fire from heaven to show the
[14:02] sign of the
[14:03] Messiah if if he went to
[14:06] Israel their eyes would have
[14:09] opened they would have understood the
[14:12] Messiah and it was not yet
[14:15] time for them to receive the
[14:18] Messiah the time of the
[14:21] Gentiles was not yet finished so God did
[14:24] not allow him to go
[14:27] there there would come another man who
[14:30] have the same
[14:32] anointing like Elijah
[14:37] like and he would go to the
[14:39] Jews but that would be after the Rapture
[14:42] of the
[14:46] Gentiles so God stopped him he told him
[14:49] you cannot go there it is not yet
[14:54] time praise God so only the fourth
[14:58] Elijah
[15:00] came to the Jew the
[15:02] Gentiles everything about the Jews is
[15:06] known everything about the Jews is
[15:09] numbered so much that we even know how
[15:11] many will be saved among the
[15:15] Jews but for the Gentiles it is totally
[15:19] by
[15:21] Grace by grace and grace
[15:24] alone God is dealing with us as
[15:27] individuals
[15:29] Ephesians
[15:31] 2:8 it says for by grace are ye saved
[15:34] through
[15:37] faith amen tell somebody we are saved by
[15:41] grace we are saved by grace in Romans
[15:45] 11:
[15:47] 24 amen I'm sorry I have a limited time
[15:50] here and so I'm going a little
[15:53] faster so you have to think quick and
[15:57] follow follow these details now
[16:00] so Romans
[16:01] 11:24 it says for if thou were cut out
[16:05] of the Olive
[16:06] Tree which is Wild by
[16:11] nature and you graft contr to Nature
[16:15] into a good olive
[16:21] tree contr to
[16:25] Nature how much more shall this
[16:29] which be the natural
[16:32] branches he crafted into their own Olive
[16:37] Tree follow me closely here God intends
[16:40] to cut off the
[16:43] Gentiles God intends to do
[16:46] it God intends to cut off the Gentiles
[16:49] and return to the
[16:52] Jews but first the times of the Gentiles
[16:57] must be fulfilled
[17:01] for he said you were saved by
[17:04] grace you the Gentiles you came in by
[17:07] grace and he said you were the Wild
[17:10] Olive
[17:13] Branch you were removed from the
[17:16] wild and you were you know brought onto
[17:19] this Olive
[17:21] Tree and the original branch of the
[17:24] Olive
[17:26] Tree was cut off
[17:29] and then you you were
[17:31] grafted he says he asks a question then
[17:34] if God can take a wild
[17:38] branch and C it onto the Olive
[17:42] Tree how much
[17:44] more those who were the
[17:47] original how easy will it be for
[17:51] him bring it back and graft them again
[17:55] let me tell you the Israel is original
[18:00] Church the gospel came to them
[18:03] first but because they rejected it they
[18:06] were
[18:08] blinded for your sake that you may
[18:11] receive the
[18:12] Gospel you were grafted
[18:14] on by Grace not of your works that you
[18:19] can boast of
[18:21] it hallelujah hallelujah that is why I
[18:24] cannot understand anyone who preaches
[18:27] the gospel of works
[18:31] because the gospel among the
[18:34] Gentiles is a message of
[18:37] Grace amen we have been grafted
[18:40] on by Grace but remember not
[18:46] permanently up to some
[18:49] time when the
[18:51] full of the Gentiles has
[18:55] come then we shall be cut off again
[18:58] and then Jesus will go back to the
[19:01] original
[19:03] Branch Israel and graft them back on
[19:08] again okay let me interpret it what he
[19:12] is saying that the Jews right now don't
[19:16] believe Jesus because their eyes were
[19:20] blinded so that can now call the Gentile
[19:25] bride when the last Gentile bride has
[19:28] come
[19:29] here it is time for Jesus now to go back
[19:33] again to the
[19:35] Jews the Gentiles will be left in their
[19:39] denominations in theirs and
[19:41] dogmas and he will go to the
[19:44] Jews so he says now I want you to follow
[19:46] me closely here Romans
[19:50] 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you
[19:53] should be ignorant of this mystery lest
[19:55] you should be wise in your own Concepts
[19:57] that blind bless in part is happened to
[20:00] Israel until the fullness of the
[20:03] Gentiles become
[20:15] [Music]
[20:25] in praise God praise God so there is a
[20:30] Time
[20:31] coming and here it is when the fullness
[20:35] of the Gentiles has
[20:38] coming how long or when will it come
[20:42] in please listen to me the fullness of
[20:45] the
[20:46] Gentiles com in by seven Church
[20:52] ages from EP
[20:57] to the time of the
[21:00] Gentiles from
[21:02] Ephesus Jesus is beginning to call his
[21:08] bride he continues calling his
[21:11] bride up
[21:14] to Revelation 1 verse
[21:18] 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord
[21:21] day and I heard behind me a great
[21:25] voice as of a trumpet
[21:29] saying I am Alpha and
[21:31] Omega the first and the
[21:34] last what thou see us write in a book
[21:39] and send it unto the seven
[21:42] churches which are in Asia now this is
[21:46] John
[21:47] seeing these visions and the Bible says
[21:50] he actually gives a testimon that he was
[21:52] in the spirit on the
[21:57] Lord the Lord's day I told you is the
[21:59] day of the Holy
[22:02] Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost
[22:04] you are in the Lord in the Lord's
[22:07] day when you receive the Holy Spirit you
[22:09] have received your
[22:12] Sabbath if you understand it say
[22:14] Amen so now he says here you know I am
[22:18] Alpha and
[22:20] Omega what you see right in a book and
[22:22] send it to the seven
[22:26] churches he says these churches
[22:30] arew in
[22:32] Asia Asia is the Gentile
[22:36] land not
[22:38] Israel so these are GLE
[22:41] churches the first one is epes the
[22:45] second one
[22:46] is thir
[22:52] is
[22:54] and and he continues on on verse 13
[22:59] where where he speaks of the mystery of
[23:01] the candlesticks and the Mystery of the
[23:08] stars please follow me Clos verse 12 he
[23:12] says and I turned to see the voice that
[23:13] spake with
[23:16] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[23:23] candlesticks and now this is John
[23:25] turning
[23:26] and he wanted to see the voice that
[23:29] spoke with
[23:30] him and he saw seven golden
[23:34] candlesticks and in the M of the of the
[23:37] seven candlesticks one like un the son
[23:39] of
[23:42] man closed with a gar down to
[23:46] the and the with a golden
[23:52] G all right now his head as his head and
[23:56] his ears were white like wo
[24:01] as white as
[24:03] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[24:07] fire and his feet like the fine like
[24:10] fine
[24:12] brass and if they bur in a
[24:16] furnace as if they bur in a
[24:20] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[24:23] many
[24:25] Waters and he had in his right hand
[24:27] [Music]
[24:30] Seven
[24:32] Stars tell your neighb Seven
[24:34] Stars and out of his mouth went that
[24:38] sharp two-edged
[24:40] sword and his countenance was as the sun
[24:43] shineth in his
[24:46] strength so when he
[24:48] turned he saw seven golden
[24:53] candles and he also
[24:56] sawen one that was in the middle of the
[24:59] seven golden
[25:02] cand like a son of
[25:05] man and then he also saw in his right
[25:09] hand there was seven
[25:11] stars all right so we we are seeing
[25:17] 777 we began with
[25:19] elishah elishah prayed stretched himself
[25:22] over the the
[25:24] child and the child sneezed how many
[25:27] times
[25:29] seven times so we're coming down to find
[25:33] the seven Gentile
[25:36] dispensation which is the time of the
[25:40] Gentiles and it comes in its fullness
[25:43] after the seventh
[25:49] church but we cannot understand
[25:52] that until we see the vision of
[25:56] John saw the Gentile
[25:59] Church John saw the the Gentile church
[26:03] as a seven
[26:05] Candlestick so the seven
[26:08] candlesticks was the fullness of the
[26:11] Gentiles listen after the
[26:15] candlesticks then comes Israel
[26:18] again right before the candlesticks is
[26:23] Israel after the Candlestick is
[26:26] Israel so now we are seeing the
[26:29] candlesticks in the middle
[26:31] there so in your mind you can draw the
[26:34] the Star of David here and the Star of
[26:35] David here and the candlesticks in the
[26:43] middle are you following me now but yet
[26:46] in the middle of the
[26:48] candle there were seven there was
[26:51] one who was like the son of man and in
[26:56] his hand were Seven
[27:00] Stars what does it mean every Church
[27:04] age had a star every Church age had a
[27:09] star but those stars were in the hands
[27:13] of
[27:14] God it was in the hands of
[27:17] Jesus Amen they weren't on their on
[27:21] their
[27:22] own they were in the hands of
[27:25] him him that is Alpha and Omega
[27:29] that is the beginning and the
[27:30] end these Stars don't have their own
[27:34] message these Stars don't have their own
[27:37] life remember the
[27:39] Sun that was in the middle of the of the
[27:44] candlesticks is the one who has the
[27:48] light the stars reflect the light of the
[27:53] sun are you following me the Stars don't
[27:58] have their own
[27:59] light the stars reflect the sign the
[28:02] light of the
[28:05] sun well here is talking of the s o n
[28:08] but we know it can it might as well be
[28:10] the
[28:13] S praise God because they they were
[28:16] reflecting the s o n
[28:20] [Music]
[28:21] light the son of
[28:26] God so what does the candlesticks
[28:30] mean what does the stars
[28:32] mean Revelation
[28:35] 1:17 and when I saw him I fell at his
[28:38] feet as
[28:40] death and he and he laid his right hand
[28:43] upon
[28:44] me saying unto me fear not I am the
[28:49] first and I am the last I am he that
[28:53] liveth and was dead Hallelujah oh I'm so
[28:58] glad to serve he that is
[29:01] alive he does not say I am he that is
[29:04] dead who was
[29:07] alive but he's saying I am he that
[29:10] live I am he that was dead and he's
[29:15] alive I want to say Jesus is alive
[29:18] today he's alive in his church he's
[29:22] alive in his
[29:23] bride churches out there are praying for
[29:26] Revival
[29:28] but we are in the Bright's
[29:30] Revival we are waiting for the
[29:33] CH our Revival is

[31:03] churches how many churches that Jesus
[31:07] have he has only one
[31:09] Church which is said upon this
[31:11] revelation of the
[31:13] world upon this revelation of who I
[31:16] am I will build my
[31:19] church and the GS of Hell shall not
[31:21] Prevail
[31:23] against the Church of Jesus Christ is
[31:26] built upon the
[31:28] revelation of Jesus
[31:31] Christ and and and this is the same
[31:35] church that has been in all the chur all
[31:38] the Seven
[31:40] Ages when he say seven
[31:43] churches it is just symbolic to Seven
[31:46] Ages so the GLE Church
[31:50] there is's alloted in a period of Seven
[31:56] Ages
[31:57] 1 2 3 4 5 6
[32:02] seven how many times remember did the
[32:04] child
[32:07] sneeze seven times we are coming back to
[32:12] that what was it meaning they were aimed
[32:16] and then
[32:19] relax you know you know ephus was the
[32:23] beginning they had the anointing of a
[32:26] lion
[32:27] and they had the truth the purity of the
[32:30] word and then somewhere they began to
[32:33] relax SM is simply you know it simply
[32:37] talks about two
[32:39] things death and
[32:42] bitterness you know and you know as the
[32:45] church started now to receive
[32:48] persecution
[32:50] and you know means
[32:52] married the church now married
[32:56] state
[32:58] they became
[32:59] one
[33:03] the the church and politics
[33:07] married and there that was the beginning
[33:10] of the Roman Catholic Church
[33:15] movement but remember in each of these
[33:19] ages had a
[33:23] star that kept the light
[33:25] shining
[33:28] it might have been a little
[33:30] light but it was shining
[33:33] in it kept life
[33:35] in and then come after
[33:40] p means a dominating
[33:44] female that is when the do of the trity
[33:47] covered the
[33:50] whole and almost the truth was lost
[33:54] complet but God had a little life
[33:59] a little light
[34:02] inise
[34:03] God hallelujah hallelujah oh my I wish I
[34:06] go in the
[34:07] details there comes
[34:09] sadis s you know sadis means the escap
[34:14] on why because this was the era or the
[34:19] edge of Martin
[34:22] Lu protestantism
[34:25] started when there was gross
[34:29] Darkness covering the Earth amen God had
[34:33] his little
[34:35] star Martin
[34:37] Luther he came and he began to
[34:40] Shine the Light of the
[34:43] World by preaching just shall live
[34:48] by alone you know he
[34:52] escaped the false Church
[34:55] system began the Reformation
[34:59] movement which we call the Protestant
[35:03] movement and then comes the 60th Church
[35:08] age
[35:09] Philadelphia Philadelphia means
[35:11] brotherly
[35:15] kindness this was a generation where the
[35:18] gospel went all over the
[35:21] world and the star of that
[35:24] age being a man called John
[35:28] Wiley a man who preached love a man who
[35:32] preached
[35:34] sanctification amen man who preached
[35:36] that if you have love for your
[35:39] brother you are going to go and give him
[35:42] the
[35:43] gospel amen a man who preached if you
[35:48] you have amen Christ in you if you're
[35:51] truly justified by faith you must truly
[35:54] be
[35:55] sanctified
[35:57] by the word of
[35:58] God you know and then after
[36:02] Philadelphia then
[36:05] comesa the Street
[36:09] Revival which amen brought a new era of
[36:15] Pentecostalism also this was the
[36:17] beginning of the last
[36:20] age the last
[36:23] Candlestick are you following me now the
[36:26] last
[36:30] praise God and
[36:32] then you know means people's
[36:36] rights that's why I say we are
[36:39] here we are
[36:41] in
[36:44] we people's
[36:46] rights Women rights children rights
[36:50] homosexual rights everybody's right this
[36:53] is the time this is the last AG
[36:57] the seventh age then where is the
[37:00] seventh
[37:02] star the seventh star must be
[37:06] here oh we are not
[37:10] in each Church
[37:12] age have a St
[37:15] messenger by the grace of God the last
[37:19] one would actually be the Elijah to the
[37:25] Gentiles Hallelujah amen I want to say
[37:28] this is not a
[37:30] coincidence some people like
[37:34] Alexander they thought they were
[37:37] Elijah but their Ministry did not
[37:40] fulfill Elijah's ministry as prescribed
[37:43] in the
[37:48] Bible
[37:50] thought he was going to restore
[37:53] righteousness and Holiness by ining
[37:57] cities that are
[38:00] holy
[38:02] physically started what they call Zion
[38:04] city in
[38:06] America and he was planning to buy a
[38:09] great big piece of land in
[38:12] Israel to buy a to build a big Zion City
[38:15] there for the
[38:17] Lord we found that that's not the
[38:20] way that Elijah's Ministry would
[38:24] be Elijah's Ministry in the end
[38:27] time would restore all
[38:31] SE Hallelujah not start some
[38:35] religion not start some
[38:38] denomination not some or something or
[38:41] some
[38:44] M I want to say that's why we believe
[38:46] William
[38:48] BR his ministry was that of
[38:52] Elijah because it
[38:54] fulfills everything the Bible said
[38:59] El God spoke to to William
[39:02] BR in
[39:04] 1933 when he was baptizing the 17th
[39:10] person seven
[39:12] again Hallelujah and he spoke to him and
[39:16] say out of the pill of
[39:18] fire thousands of people were
[39:22] there and the
[39:24] voice John the Baptist
[39:28] was sent for on my
[39:30] first your message will for on my
[39:36] second God
[39:38] himself declared who Elijah
[39:42] was in the end
[39:44] time just like Jesus
[39:47] himself he came and
[39:49] declared John Was
[39:51] Elijah Even in our
[39:53] generation Jesus himself through the
[39:57] pill of fire declare that William BR was
[40:02] the Elijah in
[40:04] theend praise God then he returned we
[40:08] are back to Kings
