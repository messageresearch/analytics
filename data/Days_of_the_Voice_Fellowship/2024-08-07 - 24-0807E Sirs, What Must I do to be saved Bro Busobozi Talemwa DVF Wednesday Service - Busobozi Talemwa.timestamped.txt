[46:20] saved so this was a question asked by
[46:22] the
[46:24] Jailer of course having being that the
[46:27] disciples had been CAU were
[46:31] CAU uh uh especially Paul and
[46:35] Silas for preaching
[46:37] Christ and there was this damel the
[46:40] Bible calls her a
[46:43] damel also B calls
[46:46] a you know she was following
[46:49] Paul and Silas and she had followed Paul
[46:53] for for a
[46:55] while and she kept speaking these words
[46:59] these men are the Servants of the most
[47:00] high
[47:02] God which show us which show unto us the
[47:05] way of the of
[47:07] Salvation so now it appeared that this
[47:10] Spirit actually Bible calls calls it a
[47:14] demon on vers
[47:17] um
[47:19] uh
[47:21] 16 and it came to pass as we went to to
[47:24] prayer a certain Dam possessed with
[47:27] Spirit of divination matters which uh
[47:31] brought her matters sorry which brought
[47:35] her Masters much gain by Soo
[47:48] saying the spirit he calls it the spirit
[47:51] of
[47:53] divination you know it was upon this
[47:55] woman
[47:57] and and she was bringing these her
[47:59] Masters a lot of
[48:02] money you know the spe of
[48:05] divination a very F
[48:07] Spirit you know and even today we still
[48:10] have them
[48:11] them and they pretend to be
[48:15] prophets some most of the things they
[48:17] say are
[48:19] right it takes the spirit of God to
[48:22] discern
[48:25] that because they will side to you and
[48:27] the things they're saying are
[48:30] right but of course they will meet heat
[48:33] misses as
[48:34] well but you see it's a spirits of
[48:37] divination and some of them can even use
[48:40] Psalms and they use
[48:43] scriptures and they they appear to be of
[48:47] God but you see it's a spirit of
[48:50] divination you have to have the spirit
[48:52] of Christ to
[48:54] discern with which Spirit someone is
[48:56] ministering
[48:59] so now this woman was actually speaking
[49:02] truth and she was saying that these are
[49:05] the Servants of
[49:07] God that teach us the ways of
[49:11] salvation but she herself was not
[49:14] saved she herself had a wrong Spirit
[49:16] upon
[49:17] her and so now when Paul looked at her
[49:21] you know after a while he got tired of
[49:24] it and the Bible actually say
[49:27] Paul
[49:29] turned and he cast out this
[49:33] spirit and he says I command thee in the
[49:36] name of Jesus
[49:38] Christ come out of her and and that
[49:42] Spirit came out of that
[49:44] same and when our
[49:46] Master you know getting money out of
[49:48] this
[49:51] thing they saw that they had lost now
[49:54] hope for their gains
[49:58] they they they now turned against Paul
[50:00] and
[50:01] Silas they pulled them to the
[50:04] market took them before the judge and
[50:07] the judge you know condemned them to be
[50:12] imprisoned and so they took them and and
[50:14] put their feet in the
[50:17] stalks yeah and so they were there the
[50:20] whole
[50:22] night with into the
[50:39] if this word will bring suffering to
[50:43] you or pain or
[50:48] accusation it is a blessing to you but
[50:51] if you are c as a
[50:53] thief
[50:55] a you know the Bible says way unto you
[50:58] because you have even
[51:01] ashamed but it is a blessing if you go
[51:04] through
[51:05] suffering for the sake of the gospel and
[51:07] of
[51:21] Christ you know the Believers we
[51:23] encourage ourself by singing and prayers
[51:28] and you know they were not singing and
[51:30] praying so that others don't hear
[51:35] them you know sometimes some people
[51:38] fear to express their
[51:41] religion to express their
[51:43] faith you come to someone you know in
[51:46] church and you don't want to say allow
[51:48] amen so that they will see
[51:52] you you know we must learn to say Amen
[51:56] you know so that let everybody know you
[51:58] are
[51:59] here let all the demons know you are in
[52:02] church let all your friends see how how
[52:05] a holy Lord you
[52:07] are never be ashamed of the Lord and of
[52:10] the
[52:12] Gospel amen I remember one time we had
[52:15] gone
[52:16] out somewhere in Ethiopia with my
[52:20] children and so Elizabeth I don't
[52:22] remember how old she was but she was a
[52:24] little bit fellow
[52:26] so we started now praying in the
[52:29] restaurant we were eating a meal and so
[52:32] I said let us pray and then I started
[52:35] you know I have a big voice so usually
[52:38] even when I do I don't mean to shout I
[52:40] end up
[52:42] shouting so I started praying dear Lord
[52:46] told me Daddy
[52:48] quiet people will hear you I said yeah
[52:51] let them hear me we are praying to our
[52:54] lord
[52:54] Jesus and I believe that's how we ought
[52:56] to be I hope that some of you when you
[52:59] go to restaurants you don't fear
[53:02] praying no matter where you are don't
[53:06] feel ashamed of your
[53:09] faith bow your heads if you are two do
[53:13] it if you one do it Praises unto
[53:17] God and the prisoners had them that's
[53:22] the point where I was and the prisoners
[53:24] had them
[53:26] they were not praying quietly or singing
[53:30] quietly they were praying until the
[53:32] prisoners heard
[53:35] them you know they prayed at home so
[53:39] they prayed in
[53:40] prison but if you you don't your life is
[53:43] not a life of prayer when you
[53:46] okay when you are in a certain prison or
[53:50] problem you cannot also pray I believe
[53:53] we should pray in good times and in bad
[53:55] times
[53:58] we should pray when things are going
[53:59] well and when things are going
[54:01] back and the Bible says this was
[54:05] midnight so they didn't sleep they were
[54:07] not
[54:11] cursing sing they sang Praises unto
[54:16] God so if you are in
[54:20] a Praises
[54:24] unto what situation
[54:29] and suddenly there was a great
[54:30] earthquake so that the foundations of
[54:32] the prison were
[54:36] shaken you know one thing I can tell you
[54:40] friends whenever you worship God or
[54:42] praise
[54:43] him whenever you talk to God and
[54:46] pray you attract
[54:49] him they were deep in the inner
[54:53] prison but the Bible says suddenly
[54:57] there was a great
[54:59] earthquake so that the foundations of of
[55:02] the prison were
[55:04] shaken and immediately all the doors
[55:06] were
[55:08] open you remember on Sunday we talked
[55:10] about he that shuts and no man
[55:14] opens and he that opens and no man
[55:18] shuts amen that is amen the one with the
[55:20] Key of
[55:22] David praise the name of the Lord we
[55:24] know this is our Lord Jesus Christ
[55:27] amen when as they were praying and as
[55:29] they were you know crying and singing
[55:31] you know the prison doors were
[55:35] open amen when doors are closed for
[55:39] you just pray and praise
[55:42] God can we learn to do that just praying
[55:45] and praising
[55:47] God not complaining and looking for help
[55:51] but praying and praising God it opens
[55:54] all not some all
[55:58] it opens all doors and everyone's BS
[56:01] were
[56:03] loed and now the keeper of the
[56:06] prison that's when he he remember to
[56:09] wake
[56:10] up and he he drew out his sword and
[56:14] wanted to kill
[56:15] himself why because he thought everybody
[56:18] had
[56:19] escaped so instead of being killed he
[56:23] wanted to kill himself before they kill
[56:24] him
[56:39] he came
[56:40] running and fell at his feet and said s
[56:45] what must I do to be
[56:48] saved ask your neighbor what must I do
[56:50] to be
[56:52] Sav what must I do to be Sav
[56:56] and now this is the
[56:59] situation of every human
[57:02] being we always think there is some
[57:06] magic
[57:09] formula there is some ACT there is
[57:13] something we need to do to be
[57:18] saved but do you know what the Bible
[57:22] says
[57:24] nothing do nothing
[57:28] what must I do to be
[57:30] saved and they answered
[57:33] him believe on the Lord Jesus
[57:37] Christ believe on the Lord Jesus
[57:41] Christ I just pray that this will be so
[57:43] personal to
[57:45] you that it will get you to another
[57:47] level of your
[57:49] faith you know these days I'm really
[57:53] determined to get us
[57:56] to mature at a certain
[57:58] level of our
[58:01] Revelation to stop being babies
[58:05] in but we have to
[58:07] mature and these series of
[58:10] sermons are really you know pressing
[58:12] towards
[58:14] that because you see you find many
[58:17] believers who are so much
[58:20] worried about what they have failed to
[58:23] do and others are so much worried
[58:26] about what they supposed to do now the
[58:29] more you worried about you failing to do
[58:31] or about what you're supposed to
[58:35] do is the more you're going to be a
[58:37] failure in this work of
[58:40] Christianity you are not supposed to
[58:41] worry about those do
[58:44] ands you are supposed to worry about
[58:47] accepting what has been done for you
[58:53] already have you believed on what has
[58:55] been done for you
[58:57] already salvation is not a set of
[59:03] [Music]
[59:04] rules do do we understand what I'm
[59:06] talking
[59:08] [Music]
[59:10] about we were in the
[59:12] carja and some of our
[59:15] brothers excommunicated some
[59:19] brothers and the basis of that
[59:23] excommunication was that their
[59:27] wives were plating their
[59:31] hair that was the
[59:34] bis you know just like you see sister
[59:36] Esther here oh my young sister here you
[59:40] you
[59:41] know they they believe they're not
[59:44] supposed to touch their
[59:45] hair their hair is just supposed to be
[59:48] straight if you do anything to eat you a
[59:51] sinner and you deserve to be chest away
[59:54] from
[59:55] church and they
[59:57] disfellowship
[59:59] disfellowshipped these are
[1:00:02] believers so and and you
[1:00:05] find that they will
[1:00:08] believe they are the ones who have a
[1:00:11] right to put in someone or take someone
[1:00:17] out you understand what I'm talking
[1:00:19] about so we need to
[1:00:21] mature we are the end time
[1:00:24] church we need to know what we
[1:00:26] believe we need to know the the the the
[1:00:30] the importance of the
[1:00:33] message you see when we do we we will
[1:00:38] mature to such a
[1:00:40] level whereby we will be able to
[1:00:42] minister
[1:00:44] Grace to even the lowest of
[1:00:48] Sinners the ex they will be able to
[1:00:50] accept
[1:00:52] Christ and believe the message of this
[1:00:56] without an
[1:00:58] effort
[1:01:00] effortlessly let me ask you a question
[1:01:04] friends a
[1:01:06] sheep put an
[1:01:09] effort to make
[1:01:13] wool
[1:01:14] sheep sheep doesn't make an
[1:01:17] e to make wool it just grows on it
[1:01:23] naturally why it all it has to do is to
[1:01:28] eat the more it eats the more the wool
[1:01:33] grows but the question is if you begin
[1:01:37] beating this
[1:01:38] sheep until it produce wo produce wool
[1:01:43] oh you're not producing wool get
[1:01:45] out but you're not feeding the
[1:01:49] sheep and we are sheep of his
[1:01:52] pasture and we are meant only to be
[1:01:54] Eaters of the world
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:01:58] the word will mature us we should desire
[1:02:02] the word we should have appetite for the
[1:02:05] world even when you come to church you
[1:02:08] must come amen
[1:02:10] Desiring you must come
[1:02:12] appetiz how do you do that by
[1:02:15] praying by waiting upon God by being
[1:02:19] expectant so when you come and walk into
[1:02:21] church even if you the only one in
[1:02:23] church you have enough
[1:02:27] eat the whole meal by
[1:02:29] yourself and next time you won't come
[1:02:31] alone you will even bring someone you
[1:02:34] know how to know that a church is
[1:02:36] getting
[1:02:38] matured they begin to get
[1:02:41] concerned you can't come to church alone
[1:02:44] you have to pick somebody amen but now
[1:02:47] when you're not matured you be like this
[1:02:49] a
[1:02:50] Sinners for us holy ones let us go to
[1:02:54] church and how you see your friend who
[1:02:56] is wearing a
[1:02:57] trouser said no this one is a
[1:03:01] Cena that one can even this one is
[1:03:04] so I remember the very first time I was
[1:03:06] judgmental like
[1:03:09] that sister was in
[1:03:12] Ethiopia and um this one brother which
[1:03:14] we had just
[1:03:16] baptized he he told me there is a sister
[1:03:20] I want to bring to
[1:03:21] you oh that sister is is filled with the
[1:03:25] spirit
[1:03:26] she's a prayer Warrior I want to bring
[1:03:29] that so you can share the word with
[1:03:32] her I said wow that's wonderful bring
[1:03:35] her so he brought her in the evening I
[1:03:38] was there with my wife and uh with with
[1:03:41] with her and and and and um and so she
[1:03:44] came when I saw her as soon as I saw
[1:03:48] her I didn't have glasses
[1:03:51] then so I just did like
[1:03:54] this in my heart I was like
[1:03:59] M what he told me is not
[1:04:01] true I did not know that he just going
[1:04:04] to waste my
[1:04:06] time why was I saying those words I was
[1:04:10] gaging this
[1:04:11] woman how she
[1:04:13] looked she was a
[1:04:16] painted she had cut all this
[1:04:20] things painted
[1:04:22] it lips were painted
[1:04:26] face was
[1:04:27] painted with
[1:04:30] earrings and and all those things as you
[1:04:32] know we
[1:04:33] do and so I looked I was seeing holdes
[1:04:36] through
[1:04:37] her she can't be a Christian and even I
[1:04:40] don't think she can believe because the
[1:04:42] message is very
[1:04:44] difficult so I I I was not appetiz to
[1:04:46] preach to
[1:04:48] her so at that moment I started just
[1:04:51] going around meing
[1:04:53] around speaking a few things here and
[1:04:55] there
[1:04:56] and she she CAU it because she was a
[1:04:59] spiritual
[1:05:00] woman so she said brother I've been
[1:05:04] fasting and praying and even now as I
[1:05:07] came I've coming from an
[1:05:10] overnight I've praying that God should
[1:05:13] visit me and God spoke to me and said he
[1:05:16] was sending someone from another country
[1:05:19] to me with a
[1:05:20] message when my friend called me I
[1:05:23] believed you were the one now I've come
[1:05:27] but you're just wasting time it looks
[1:05:29] like you are saying something it looks
[1:05:31] like you're not
[1:05:33] saying whatever you have if it is from
[1:05:36] God say it I believe
[1:05:40] it it looked like a
[1:05:42] rebuke I was so challenged friends I was
[1:05:47] from that moment I changed my
[1:05:50] perspective of seeing the message as a
[1:05:54] set of rules
[1:05:57] and I started seeing the message as a
[1:05:59] message of
[1:06:00] Grace and that's why I present the
[1:06:02] message the way I
[1:06:04] do because I believe this is a message
[1:06:08] of Grace not a message of and
[1:06:12] rules and if we see it that way you can
[1:06:16] actually get so much empowered and you
[1:06:18] can mature so
[1:06:20] fast whereby you will overcome the
[1:06:22] things that we overcoming before
[1:06:27] and that woman I preached to her for
[1:06:29] about 2 three hours that very night she
[1:06:33] believe the message and we baptized that
[1:06:36] that woman the following morning she was
[1:06:39] very busy interpreting for me in a
[1:06:40] Pentecostal
[1:06:44] church and through her the Revival
[1:06:48] started in
[1:06:49] eth and now there are hundreds of
[1:06:51] thousands of
[1:06:54] believer all started like that I want
[1:06:57] you to imagine you cannot be the one to
[1:07:00] put in someone or take out
[1:07:05] someone the jail asked a
[1:07:08] question that's why I want you to pay
[1:07:11] attention it's not just like any usual
[1:07:14] preaching I'm setting
[1:07:17] principles of this message I want it to
[1:07:20] understand I want it to be a part of you
[1:07:24] I want you to mature and then you will
[1:07:26] begin to see things
[1:07:28] different so I want you to see this man
[1:07:30] came to
[1:07:31] him and he asked a question he said s
[1:07:35] what must I
[1:07:38] do do you see that thing this man is a
[1:07:43] Jailer this man has been told to listen
[1:07:46] to
[1:07:49] rules they they brought these people
[1:07:52] in just like others and they told him
[1:07:55] keep them make sure you keep them
[1:07:58] suffing those are the rules he's used
[1:08:01] to and so he thinks everything is about
[1:08:05] rules everything is about dos and
[1:08:08] dos that's why he even wanted to kill
[1:08:11] himself because of
[1:08:14] failure you know when you see the word
[1:08:16] as rules and of dos and
[1:08:21] don'ts you the moment you
[1:08:24] fail don't even want to come to
[1:08:27] church you will take yourself Far Away
[1:08:29] From
[1:08:31] Grace you will go away from you run away
[1:08:33] from
[1:08:34] God when God told Adam of this fruit you
[1:08:38] should not
[1:08:40] eat and so when he did he quickly ran
[1:08:43] away from the presence of God because he
[1:08:46] was seeing the word of God as rules and
[1:08:49] of those
[1:08:52] and so this is why this man was asking
[1:08:56] what must I
[1:08:58] do he thought it's all about what he was
[1:09:01] able to
[1:09:03] do or what he was not supposed to
[1:09:07] do in order to attain
[1:09:09] salvation Salvation is simpler than how
[1:09:12] we make
[1:09:14] it salvation is simpler than how we
[1:09:16] think about
[1:09:19] it when the disciples looked at him they
[1:09:23] never did tell him to do anything
[1:09:26] they simply told him believe on the Lord
[1:09:29] Jesus
[1:09:31] Christ and you and your entire
[1:09:35] house will be saved hallelujah oh glory
[1:09:40] to God I wish I can overemphasize
[1:09:44] this so the all things I'm going to say
[1:09:46] today is all about
[1:09:48] that I just want you to hold on to every
[1:09:51] word so you see these disciples told the
[1:09:54] man to
[1:09:57] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ not to
[1:10:00] believe on what he can
[1:10:02] do not to do certain things to make
[1:10:06] Christ accept
[1:10:07] him you know Jesus Christ brother bam
[1:10:11] said some people say i s the Lord i s
[1:10:15] the Lord i s the
[1:10:17] Lord but the prophet would say no you
[1:10:20] never did seek the Lord the Lord sought
[1:10:23] after you
[1:10:26] when when they sinned in the garden of
[1:10:28] aen who who sought the
[1:10:31] other it was God seeking after
[1:10:35] fallam and his entire
[1:10:37] rest praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:10:41] and so we see it has always been
[1:10:45] faith in other words the disciples told
[1:10:48] him it's not about what you should
[1:10:51] do just have faith
[1:10:56] and that's the faith I want us talk
[1:10:58] about in Hebrews
[1:11:02] 11:6 but without faith it is impossible
[1:11:06] to please
[1:11:07] him for he that cometh to
[1:11:10] God must believe that he
[1:11:14] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:11:16] that diligently
[1:11:20] seek can we now read that again with
[1:11:23] understanding
[1:11:26] but without
[1:11:27] faith it is impossible to please
[1:11:31] him tell me what can you do that will
[1:11:35] please the
[1:11:38] Lord what coming to church dressing well
[1:11:43] speaking well doing things well there is
[1:11:47] this one man he was um he was a believer
[1:11:51] of the
[1:11:52] law we called him the Rich Young Ruler
[1:11:56] so this young man came to Jesus and he
[1:11:59] told him master who Master what must I
[1:12:05] do to be to the kingdom of
[1:12:08] God same question what must I do to
[1:12:11] be are you following me Jesus looked at
[1:12:15] him he said why do you call me good only
[1:12:18] God is
[1:12:19] good so if you understand the Bible he's
[1:12:22] trying to tell him you are saying I am
[1:12:27] God so Jesus
[1:12:29] confirmed he was
[1:12:32] God you're calling me good only God is
[1:12:36] good in other words I am good okay let
[1:12:39] me tell you if you think I'm good then
[1:12:42] you should know I am God and everything
[1:12:44] else I'm about to tell you is the word
[1:12:47] of
[1:12:48] life because God is the only source of
[1:12:52] life and so now he started telling
[1:12:56] you know okay you go and do the works of
[1:12:58] the Lord don't
[1:13:02] don't he said
[1:13:05] oh thank you I've done all those
[1:13:08] things just doing those good works since
[1:13:11] I was a
[1:13:13] child I have not committed without you I
[1:13:16] have loved God I have not stolen from
[1:13:20] any man I've not done this Jesus agreed
[1:13:23] with him he said yes you said I'm God so
[1:13:28] yes you've done all those things but
[1:13:30] there is one thing you've not
[1:13:31] done said what is it what is
[1:13:35] it go go sell all your
[1:13:38] riches give it to the poor come follow
[1:13:43] me now Jesus brought that in in a form
[1:13:46] of
[1:13:50] doing do you think why please just focus
[1:13:54] here
[1:13:56] do you think it was about the
[1:13:58] money do you think it was about the
[1:14:00] buildings and the riches he
[1:14:03] had it had nothing to do with all those
[1:14:06] things nothing
[1:14:09] completely but what was it about because
[1:14:12] even Jesus told him go sell the money
[1:14:13] give to the poor he didn't say bring to
[1:14:15] the
[1:14:18] church no so it wasn't about the money
[1:14:20] that he
[1:14:22] wanted what was Jesus looking for
[1:14:26] he was looking for
[1:14:29] obedience he was looking for
[1:14:32] Faith amen because even he said
[1:14:34] obedience is better than
[1:14:38] sacrifice you know you can sacrifice all
[1:14:40] you
[1:14:41] want but if you don't believe his word
[1:14:45] and you don't submit to it and you don't
[1:14:48] believe it all your sacrifices for
[1:14:52] nothing so he told him go sell
[1:14:54] everything
[1:14:56] give to the poor come follow me so in
[1:14:59] other words believe on
[1:15:02] me I am God so believe what I'm
[1:15:05] saying the Bible says the man went away
[1:15:08] s in
[1:15:09] his because he had great
[1:15:12] riches so now many of us are not able to
[1:15:15] have faith in
[1:15:17] God because of our
[1:15:19] riches what are our riches oh my the
[1:15:23] Bible says where whever your treasure it
[1:15:26] says where your treasure
[1:15:28] is there your heart is also are you
[1:15:32] following me chch hallelujah amen where
[1:15:35] your treasure is where your your heart
[1:15:39] is also so in other words if you see
[1:15:42] someone not able to come to
[1:15:45] church because of a deal
[1:15:49] somewhere that is their
[1:15:51] treasure you don't you don't you can't
[1:15:53] worship God
[1:15:56] because of
[1:15:57] something you can't believe the
[1:15:59] word because of
[1:16:01] something what that thing is becoming a
[1:16:06] God to you and therefore you you are
[1:16:09] unbelieving the
[1:16:11] word you are refusing to submit to the
[1:16:14] word because of that thing and therefore
[1:16:18] you have
[1:16:19] disobeyed and therefore you are a
[1:16:22] sinner you see how easy salvation
[1:16:26] it's all about
[1:16:28] faith it's not about works the things
[1:16:31] you do only show your faith or your
[1:16:37] unbelief I just pray that you go back
[1:16:39] and listen to these things afterwards
[1:16:40] because I don't know whether everybody
[1:16:42] is getting
[1:16:43] everything listen brother bam would come
[1:16:46] on to
[1:16:47] say stealing is not a sin doubt is not a
[1:16:51] sin drinking is not a sin prostition is
[1:16:54] not a sin
[1:16:55] and all these things are not a sin but
[1:16:58] he said they are
[1:17:00] fruits of the sin so what's the sin the
[1:17:05] sin is not the works you
[1:17:07] do the sin he says you have to first
[1:17:11] unbeli the
[1:17:13] word to do the wrong
[1:17:16] things if you are a Believer you cannot
[1:17:19] unbel the word if the word says um Thou
[1:17:24] shalt not commit adultery so you are
[1:17:26] going to hold on to that as the word of
[1:17:29] God you're going to believe it and
[1:17:32] because you believe you will leave it
[1:17:35] but if you cannot believe it you will go
[1:17:38] and commit doubt why because you don't
[1:17:41] believe this word so he won't judge you
[1:17:44] for what you have
[1:17:45] done but he will judge you for unbelief
[1:17:47] for being a sinner for unbelieving his
[1:17:51] word but he says they that are born of
[1:17:54] of
[1:17:55] God they cannot
[1:17:58] see why because the seed of God remains
[1:18:01] in
[1:18:04] him that's the seed of God I want to
[1:18:06] talk about
[1:18:08] today that seed of God is called
[1:18:11] faith when that seed of God is in you
[1:18:14] the Bible says there is no way you can
[1:18:18] see they that are born of God cannot
[1:18:22] sin because the seed of God remains in
[1:18:24] him
[1:18:27] hallelujah amen and if you have that
[1:18:30] seed of God in
[1:18:32] you it is impossible for you to
[1:18:35] sin and you will always please the
[1:18:38] Lord and he says without faith it is
[1:18:42] impossible to please him so then how are
[1:18:46] you going to please him by having faith
[1:18:48] in everything he
[1:18:51] says by holding dear his word
[1:18:55] by punctuating every word with
[1:18:59] amen by believing everything he
[1:19:02] says whether it is REM
[1:19:05] word or it is written word are you
[1:19:08] following me sometimes the scriptures
[1:19:11] written sometimes it's a spoken
[1:19:14] word but if you said it you
[1:19:18] should and that will please
[1:19:21] him praise the name of the Lord and
[1:19:24] that's
[1:19:25] why amen when he wanted that
[1:19:28] tree sorry that fruit from that tree and
[1:19:33] that tree could not that fig tree could
[1:19:34] not give him any
[1:19:37] fruit he cast it why because any man
[1:19:41] that does not believe the word or
[1:19:43] anything that does not believe the
[1:19:47] word is under a
[1:19:50] curse when he was on Earth he said
[1:19:53] because you do not believe me
[1:19:55] you are judged
[1:19:58] already but they that believe he says
[1:20:02] there is there for
[1:20:03] now no
[1:20:05] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:20:09] who walk not after the flesh but they
[1:20:12] work after the
[1:20:15] spirit my you know when you get this
[1:20:20] concept the whole Bible becomes a new
[1:20:23] book
[1:20:26] you know the Journey of Christianity
[1:20:28] becomes so
[1:20:30] easy it is no longer a heavy
[1:20:33] y because Jesus said come to me all that
[1:20:38] Labor All That
[1:20:41] heavy I will give you rest he said my
[1:20:45] yoke is
[1:20:47] light so and the Yoke of the of Christ
[1:20:49] is the
[1:20:51] word to a Believer the word is not a
[1:20:54] heavy
[1:20:57] lad do I believe the word is
[1:21:02] light that's why I'm
[1:21:12] saying of Grace you have never
[1:21:15] understood the power that can help you
[1:21:18] to to drive your mot
[1:21:21] body under submission
[1:21:24] the word and so this is the concept I'm
[1:21:27] sharing with
[1:21:28] you he said without faith it is
[1:21:32] impossible
[1:21:33] toe for he that cometh to
[1:21:36] God Must
[1:21:39] Believe not should
[1:21:41] believe not might believe or may believe
[1:21:45] but must
[1:21:48] believe he that cometh to God Must
[1:21:52] Believe says what
[1:21:55] to be believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:59] he that cometh to God must
[1:22:02] believe that he
[1:22:05] is that God is and that he is a
[1:22:10] rewarder of them that diligently
[1:22:14] seek how do you seek Him you seek Him
[1:22:18] diligently you seek him with an
[1:22:19] intention of finding
[1:22:22] him you find that rich
[1:22:25] was seeking him but he never had an
[1:22:28] intention of following what he was
[1:22:30] saying when he was seeking the word when
[1:22:34] you seeking the attention of
[1:22:36] God and you want to know the will of God
[1:22:39] when he makes his will
[1:22:42] know submit to that
[1:22:44] will and he will reward you
[1:22:48] accordingly hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:22:52] hallelujah the church is built upon that
[1:22:57] praise the name of the Lord and that's
[1:22:59] why he told Peter in in Matthew
[1:23:01] 16 Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:23:06] know told us that rock was
[1:23:11] Revelation are you following me now that
[1:23:13] rock was revelation of what revelation
[1:23:18] of who Jesus Christ
[1:23:21] is Oh Glory to God that comes to God
[1:23:26] must believe that he is and he a
[1:23:28] rewarder of them that dently
[1:23:32] re the church is built upon the
[1:23:35] rock of who Jesus is oh my God how many
[1:23:39] I enjoying this
[1:23:40] tonight and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:23:44] Prevail against so you see the Gates of
[1:23:47] Hell cannot Prevail against a believer
[1:23:51] of the
[1:23:55] so you see he say here in the in the
[1:23:59] message the Rapture you see it is a
[1:24:03] revelation the Revelation is
[1:24:05] Faith you cannot have Revelation without
[1:24:09] it being
[1:24:14] Faith so you see it is
[1:24:17] Faith Revelation is is
[1:24:20] faith faith is a revelation
[1:24:24] because it is something that is revealed
[1:24:27] to
[1:24:28] you faith is a
[1:24:30] revelation faith is something that has
[1:24:33] been revealed to
[1:24:36] you like to it was to
[1:24:39] Abraham and that could call anything
[1:24:42] contrary to what he had been revealed to
[1:24:44] him as though it was it wasn't
[1:24:51] so now listen faith that's what faith is
[1:24:56] is the revelation of
[1:24:59] God the church is built upon a
[1:25:04] revelation the whole entire
[1:25:07] body are you
[1:25:09] saved you will say yes how sure are
[1:25:13] you by what
[1:25:16] faith what is Faith by a revelation so
[1:25:20] it is revealed to you but what kind of
[1:25:23] faith is that
[1:25:25] is it your personal faith is it your
[1:25:28] human Faith did you know that human
[1:25:31] Faith
[1:25:33] fails it fails you can actually believe
[1:25:36] with your human Faith but then that
[1:25:39] Faith Can
[1:25:40] fail praise God you see we see that it
[1:25:43] failed
[1:25:44] once Peter had it and when he was using
[1:25:48] that intellectual
[1:25:50] faith and he said I will be with you
[1:25:52] everywhere
[1:25:54] but you see when they when the people
[1:25:56] came and accused him his faith failed he
[1:26:00] told he told them I'm not one of
[1:26:02] them what what was that was he saying
[1:26:06] the truth at first yeah he was sincere
[1:26:10] but that Faith he had was
[1:26:14] intellectual and that's why we cannot
[1:26:15] rely brother B preached a message of not
[1:26:18] leaning on our own
[1:26:22] understanding you can't debate the word
[1:26:24] of God
[1:26:25] you can't reason the word of God the
[1:26:28] word of God is to be
[1:26:30] believed you don't believe it with your
[1:26:32] own
[1:26:33] faith you believe it with the faith of
[1:26:36] the Son of
[1:26:37] God we will get there now see in the
[1:26:42] book of Ephesians chapter
[1:26:44] 2 8 it says for by
[1:26:47] grace are you
[1:26:49] sa
[1:26:52] through through
[1:26:56] get there get there get there fast
[1:26:57] Ephesians CH
[1:26:59] 2:8 don't miss
[1:27:02] this Ephesians
[1:27:05] 2:8 what does it
[1:27:09] say for by grace are you
[1:27:14] saved really Believers we need to have a
[1:27:18] pen and especially young
[1:27:22] people you come and done these
[1:27:26] scriptures so you can well I know these
[1:27:29] things are now you know they go online
[1:27:31] and you can go back again and
[1:27:33] listen I understand that but also it's
[1:27:36] good for you to have your own personal
[1:27:39] not while the word is going on God can
[1:27:42] reveal something personally to
[1:27:44] you and then you want to write it down
[1:27:48] so let us look at verse eight for by
[1:27:51] grace are ye saved through faith
[1:27:57] did you get that by Grace we are saved
[1:28:02] but not grace
[1:28:03] alone
[1:28:06] through so the
[1:28:09] road of
[1:28:12] Salvation is called
[1:28:15] Faith the
[1:28:17] highway is called
[1:28:20] Grace for by
[1:28:22] grace through faith
[1:28:25] you understand that and that not of
[1:28:29] yourselves it is the gift of
[1:28:33] God not of
[1:28:35] works okay let me first pause a bit he
[1:28:40] says you are saved by grace through
[1:28:45] faith but that not of
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:51] yourselves is not talking about your own
[1:28:54] human
[1:28:57] Faith he talking oh my God I wish you
[1:29:00] get it he's talking about the faith that
[1:29:03] is the gift of
[1:29:06] God are you getting it now if you're not
[1:29:10] getting it just say Amen
[1:29:13] come not of
[1:29:15] works so you see is L any man should
[1:29:20] boast for we are his workmanship
[1:29:25] created in Christ Jesus unto good
[1:29:28] works which God has before ordained that
[1:29:31] we should walk in
[1:29:34] them now before I get into a little bit
[1:29:38] deeper on
[1:29:41] this we will go to Galatians
[1:29:44] soon but I want to read you a quote
[1:29:47] here and brother bam is speaking on the
[1:29:49] spirit leading you to believe
[1:29:54] but we know that the spirit leads you to
[1:29:55] believe by
[1:30:00] faith okay listen it says there first
[1:30:04] has to be a creation or cre to create a
[1:30:06] creation to make you long and believe in
[1:30:16] God and when it does as sure as you
[1:30:19] believe in
[1:30:21] that that shows there is a fountain of
[1:30:23] divine
[1:30:27] heing it's got to be and the Bible
[1:30:29] speaks and says that it
[1:30:32] is it is his it is his holy spirit that
[1:30:36] leads
[1:30:38] you you see why it is important for a
[1:30:41] Believer to receive the Holy
[1:30:43] Spirit if you do not receive the Holy
[1:30:47] Spirit you can never have the right kind
[1:30:50] of
[1:30:52] Faith let me put this way the holy
[1:30:56] spirit is the only
[1:30:58] faith that can make you get
[1:31:02] saved the holy spirit is the power to
[1:31:06] make you get
[1:31:08] saved is the power that saves you it
[1:31:11] drives you he leads you he guides you he
[1:31:14] shows you things to he he he he he pulls
[1:31:18] you from a level where you have been
[1:31:21] human level human faith a level where
[1:31:24] you
[1:31:26] attain superatural
[1:31:28] Faith to believe for the impossible when
[1:31:32] you receive the holy spirit all of you
[1:31:34] are have the same power
[1:31:55] to exercise your
[1:31:59] faith faith is like a
[1:32:02] muscle you see the more you exercise the
[1:32:06] more stronger you become if you don't
[1:32:08] exercise for a while and You Begin
[1:32:11] running you know what happens you know
[1:32:14] you feel you know the tingling in your
[1:32:17] body pain and Ms and all those
[1:32:21] things that he wasn't going to die
[1:32:25] until he see the Lord is
[1:32:27] Christ that same Holy Spirit speaks to
[1:32:31] you Hallelujah so here brother B is
[1:32:34] trying to show us that the holy spirit
[1:32:38] will lead you to
[1:32:40] believe in things that are yours and for
[1:32:45] you so you find people who exercise
[1:32:50] that they believe they believe for
[1:32:53] things and then they pray because they
[1:32:56] believe God will give it to them and
[1:32:59] because they have seen it it works they
[1:33:02] will go again believe for more pray and
[1:33:05] believe for it pray and believe for it
[1:33:07] and it will happen they will go back
[1:33:09] again Hallelujah he said the same holy
[1:33:13] spirit that revealed to
[1:33:15] Simeon that he will not die until he
[1:33:18] sees the Messiah is the same holy spirit
[1:33:21] that speaks to you
[1:33:24] Hallelujah huj when he speaks to you
[1:33:28] whatever he leads you to
[1:33:31] believe is
[1:33:33] yours is
[1:33:35] yours now that's why we say levels of
[1:33:40] faith it is not different
[1:33:43] faith it is different exercising of your
[1:33:46] same faith
[1:33:53] you will get
[1:33:54] it you believe for a bicyc you
[1:33:58] get you understand one will believe for
[1:34:01] five
[1:34:02] children believe for 10
[1:34:04] children right it's the same Faith but
[1:34:07] you see it depends on how you're willing
[1:34:09] to
[1:34:11] exercise God is willing and is
[1:34:14] able to accomplish everything and
[1:34:17] anything we
[1:34:20] believe
[1:34:22] Hallelujah if we believe for our church
[1:34:25] land and we say God will give it to us
[1:34:29] that's what he will give it to us I've
[1:34:31] had some men
[1:34:32] say why are you doing that that land in
[1:34:36] this area is
[1:34:38] expensive you could go
[1:34:41] somewhere like how others have done and
[1:34:44] you go in some ghetto
[1:34:46] somewhere you know where is all the mess
[1:34:48] and
[1:34:49] everything and you you know just get a
[1:34:51] portion of L
[1:34:53] in a w
[1:34:55] land the money you have you can even
[1:34:57] buy I told him that's your
[1:35:00] faith that's your faith but if we are
[1:35:03] believing for big things amen if we
[1:35:05] believing for what the word of God tells
[1:35:07] us to believe
[1:35:09] for amen it is our faith and God is able
[1:35:13] to
[1:35:16] accomplish he is able to accomplish if
[1:35:19] you believe for a house of two
[1:35:20] rooms and I believe for a house of five
[1:35:23] rooms
[1:35:24] we all have faith it's just a measure
[1:35:27] that we
[1:35:28] have but the same Faith but how are you
[1:35:31] exercising
[1:35:38] yours okay I'm not just talking about
[1:35:41] faith as in
[1:35:43] faith I'm trying to bring you to an
[1:35:48] understanding of the faith that gives us
[1:35:52] salvation the same faith that gives us
[1:35:55] salvation is the same faith that
[1:35:58] actually gives us um everything else we
[1:36:05] need and that Faith let me emphasize
[1:36:08] here is not faith in
[1:36:15] Christ it is the Faith of
[1:36:19] Christ did somebody get
[1:36:21] it open your Bible
[1:36:25] I told you you need to go back and
[1:36:26] listen to
[1:36:28] this Galatians 2:
[1:36:31] 20 that's why I'm going a bit slow so we
[1:36:34] can catch
[1:36:37] everyone Galan CH 2: 20 if you can stand
[1:36:41] there with
[1:36:44] me it says I am crucified with
[1:36:48] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[1:36:52] Christ live in me and the life which I
[1:36:55] now live in the flesh I live by the
[1:36:58] faith of the Son of God who loved me and
[1:37:02] gave himself for me
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:26] okay interpret this this way and the
[1:37:29] life which I now live in the
[1:37:32] flesh I live by the
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:36] faith no no no no no
[1:37:40] no okay I live by the faith of the son
[1:37:43] of God
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:53] yes you get it
[1:37:56] now is talking about the faith of the
[1:38:00] Son of
[1:38:02] God not the faith in the Son of
[1:38:09] God just say what I'm saying exactly
[1:38:12] because here is where the real thing is
[1:38:15] now I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:38:17] God not son of man Son of
[1:38:21] God okay let let me first pause
[1:38:25] there we have three dispensation of
[1:38:33] sunship okay the
[1:38:36] first son of
[1:38:39] man Christ as son of
[1:38:42] man he is a prophet a man on Earth that
[1:38:46] Ministry ended when he died on Calvary
[1:38:50] and then there's a second
[1:38:52] Ministry of him as a Son of
[1:38:55] God now as a Son of
[1:38:58] God is the holy
[1:39:01] spirit it began on the day of
[1:39:04] Pentecost and it continues on until the
[1:39:07] Rapture now listen closely here when
[1:39:10] Christ was on Earth he said who do they
[1:39:14] say that I the son of
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:21] man not Son of God but
[1:39:24] so meaning yeah I'm a man I'm a son of
[1:39:28] man is a prophetic Ministry so who do
[1:39:31] they say I am that's why they said oh
[1:39:33] some say you're Moses others say you
[1:39:35] elah others one of the
[1:39:37] prophets you're just a prophet but he
[1:39:40] said but who do you say that I son of
[1:39:43] man you who do you say that I
[1:39:46] am yes I'm a prophet I am right now
[1:39:49] within my prophetic Ministry on Earth
[1:39:55] but tell me you my disciples who do you
[1:39:59] say that I
[1:40:00] am and one of them amen receed the
[1:40:04] Revelation receive the
[1:40:07] faith Hallelujah it didn't come from a
[1:40:10] man it was not his own faith oh my God I
[1:40:14] don't know whether you're getting this
[1:40:16] it was not his own
[1:40:18] faith you get it very soon amen what was
[1:40:21] it it was a faith which came from
[1:40:25] above it was a revelation which came
[1:40:28] from above it was a faith of
[1:40:31] God and he came upon him and do you know
[1:40:34] what he say he upgraded
[1:40:38] Jesus and he said you are Jesus Christ
[1:40:43] the son of the Living
[1:40:45] God so he said you are the Son of God
[1:40:49] you are not just a son of man you are a
[1:40:51] son of God he took him from one phase of
[1:40:56] ministry and he took him to another pH
[1:40:59] Son of God means holy spirit and means
[1:41:01] God
[1:41:04] himself but son of man means Prophet man
[1:41:06] on
[1:41:09] Earth you get brother M so now when he
[1:41:12] said you are Jesus Christ Jesus said who
[1:41:16] do you say that I who do they say that I
[1:41:18] the son of man
[1:41:21] am and and he said
[1:41:23] yeah they saying you're one of the
[1:41:25] prophets what about you my disciples
[1:41:27] said you are Jesus Christ the son of the
[1:41:31] living so in other words you are no more
[1:41:34] than a
[1:41:36] prophet you are God
[1:41:38] himself Jesus looked at Peter he
[1:41:41] realized this was more faith than what a
[1:41:44] human being can
[1:41:48] have when I said faith I mean
[1:41:51] Revelation this was more reation it was
[1:41:54] higher Revelation and how did Jesus talk
[1:41:57] to him back amen he said to him Peter
[1:42:02] amen you Peter Upon This Rock Amen he
[1:42:06] said he said Flesh and
[1:42:09] Blood Flesh and Blood meaning you Peter
[1:42:12] in yourself
[1:42:14] human has not revealed this to you
[1:42:17] meaning Peter this is not your faith as
[1:42:20] a
[1:42:21] man this is not your human face Peter
[1:42:25] let me tell you Peter where that came
[1:42:27] from God himself has given you this
[1:42:32] Revelation so in other words Peter what
[1:42:35] you have understood right
[1:42:37] now God has given you his own
[1:42:41] faith it's a gift which come from above
[1:42:45] and come upon you and he said Upon This
[1:42:48] Rock upon this faith upon this
[1:42:51] Revelation I will build my
[1:42:54] church and the church is built upon that
[1:42:59] Faith this is the victory that overcomes
[1:43:02] the
[1:43:03] world this is the way that we can live
[1:43:05] above our defeating you know things and
[1:43:08] and all these worldly
[1:43:14] things not in our human
[1:43:17] Faith but in the faith of the Son of
[1:43:21] God Amen which we receive as a
[1:43:25] gift which we receive from
[1:43:28] God that comes from
[1:43:30] God the faith of the Son of
[1:43:33] God I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:43:37] God if you understand you say
[1:43:40] amen I live by the faith of the
[1:43:43] son the Son of God who loved
[1:43:46] me and gave himself for me of course we
[1:43:50] know that is also son of David
[1:43:53] that is in the Millennium is going to be
[1:43:55] as a king but Son of God here is talking
[1:43:58] about the Holy Spirit
[1:44:02] dispensation oh my God Amen oh my god
[1:44:07] wow I do not frustrate the grace of
[1:44:11] God for it is the
[1:44:14] righteousness come by the for for if
[1:44:17] righteousness come by the
[1:44:20] law then Christ is dead in vain
[1:44:26] this Faith enables us to believe in a
[1:44:29] finished sacrifice on the
[1:44:32] cross this Faith enables us to surrender
[1:44:36] to the lordship of Jesus Christ the
[1:44:38] Jesus we have never
[1:44:41] seen this is not our own
[1:44:44] faith this is you know our faith
[1:44:47] produces good
[1:44:49] works but this faith of ours
[1:44:54] does not save us from our
[1:44:56] sins that's why that Rich Young
[1:45:00] Ruler all the good
[1:45:02] works by his own faith but he had
[1:45:05] received the faith of the
[1:45:08] son the faith of the Son of God is
[1:45:11] something
[1:45:12] else it's the gift of
[1:45:16] God Amen that's what we see in the book
[1:45:20] of Acts chapter 2
[1:45:23] he says repent and be baptized every
[1:45:28] of and
[1:45:30] ye it says your sins shall be
[1:45:33] forgiven and ye shall
[1:45:35] receive the what the
[1:45:39] what the
[1:45:41] gift of what of the faith of the Son of
[1:45:45] God you get it you shall receive the
[1:45:48] gift of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah
[1:45:53] I live by
[1:45:56] faith in the Son of
[1:45:58] God I live by faith in
[1:46:03] theol do you get it brother
[1:46:08] sister my my my
[1:46:10] my and there it is it said
[1:46:13] this it said
[1:46:16] this for by grace are you
[1:46:19] saved through
[1:46:21] faith and not of
[1:46:24] yourselves not your own
[1:46:26] faith it is the
[1:46:28] what the gift
[1:46:31] God and ye shall receive the gift
[1:46:35] of the holy
[1:46:40] spirit so you see why every believer
[1:46:43] must have
[1:46:44] it if you don't have the Holy Spirit you
[1:46:48] don't have the gift of God to make you
[1:46:51] understand the word to make the word
[1:46:54] make for the Rapture and if without
[1:46:57] faith this Faith you can never please
[1:47:01] God it is
[1:47:03] impossible it is
[1:47:07] impossible so now how does this Faith
[1:47:12] come Romans chapter
[1:47:15] 10 verse
[1:47:18] 16 friends you just B yourself in the
[1:47:20] word these things are so beautiful
[1:47:25] but they have not all obeyed the
[1:47:28] gospel for Isaiah sayth
[1:47:32] Lord who has believed our
[1:47:36] report so then
[1:47:38] Faith which Faith the faith of the Son
[1:47:41] of God which Faith the holy
[1:47:47] spirit so then Faith cometh by hearing
[1:47:53] and
[1:47:55] hearing by the word of
[1:47:59] God did you get it
[1:48:02] now now let me
[1:48:05] just I don't
[1:48:07] think I can explain it
[1:48:11] better than that let's just get into the
[1:48:15] message the P paman Church
[1:48:20] age and we read um quot
[1:48:23] there where brother bam is trying to
[1:48:25] explain this same thing I'm trying to
[1:48:29] explain acts 3:1 16 it says when Peter
[1:48:33] was asked how Mighty Miracles had taken
[1:48:35] place upon the crippled one at the gate
[1:48:38] beautiful he explained it like
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:49] this and his meaning Jesus name through
[1:48:53] faith in his Jesus name has made this
[1:48:57] man the former Creer strong the for has
[1:49:01] made him
[1:49:10] strong yeah the faith which is by
[1:49:13] meaning from him Jesus has given him
[1:49:16] this man this perfect soundness in the
[1:49:19] presence of you all
[1:49:28] see there it is Jesus name and Jesus's
[1:49:31] Faith brought about the
[1:49:37] miracle everybody say Jesus's name and
[1:49:41] Jesus's Fai brought about the
[1:49:44] miracle Peter did not claim it was his
[1:49:47] own human Faith any more than he claimed
[1:49:51] that it was his own name
[1:49:58] he said that Jesus's name used in the
[1:50:01] faith which is from
[1:50:17] Jesus thank you now you're getting it
[1:50:20] amen oh my God this is so sweet he said
[1:50:22] that Jesus name using the faith which is
[1:50:24] from Jesus perform that great
[1:50:29] work this faith is what the Lord was
[1:50:33] speaking about in Revelation
[1:50:36] 213 it was his Capital his
[1:50:41] faith it was not faith in
[1:50:45] him but it was his own
[1:50:49] faith that he had given to the Believers
[1:50:54] Hallelujah he has given us his
[1:50:58] faith we live by the faith of the Son of
[1:51:03] God my my my my that's why we cannot
[1:51:07] fail that's why we cannot go to hell
[1:51:10] that's why we can be overcome by the
[1:51:12] world because we have his own
[1:51:19] faith it was not faith in him
[1:51:24] but it was his own
[1:51:25] faith that he had given to the
[1:51:27] Believers Romans
[1:51:30] 123 according as he has dealt to every
[1:51:34] man according to uh verse one the men
[1:51:38] are Brethren The Measure of
[1:51:41] Faith according to the measure of
[1:51:45] Faith Ephesians 28 By The Grace are you
[1:51:48] saved through faith
[1:51:52] and that
[1:51:54] faith not of
[1:51:56] yourself this is how I what I was
[1:51:58] explaining to you you see not of
[1:52:01] yourself that faith not of
[1:52:04] yourself it is a gift of
[1:52:08] God and it also says in James
[1:52:12] 2:1 my brethren notice he to is talking
[1:52:17] to
[1:52:18] Brethren this faith is for believers
[1:52:22] is have not the faith my brethren have
[1:52:25] not the faith of not in but the faith of
[1:52:28] the Lord Jesus Christ with respect to
[1:52:30] person don't he says don't Brethren
[1:52:33] don't have the faith of the Lord Jesus
[1:52:35] Christ with respect to
[1:52:40] persons in this paman church
[1:52:44] age where men were humanizing
[1:52:48] salvation having turned from the truth
[1:52:51] that salvation is of the Lord
[1:52:55] everybody say salvation is of the
[1:52:57] Lord having cast aside the do of
[1:53:02] election and opened wide the church door
[1:53:05] and their fellowships to any and all who
[1:53:07] subscribe to their
[1:53:11] tenants as long as never mind the word
[1:53:15] never mind
[1:53:16] word in this age of Rapid
[1:53:20] degradation there were still the few who
[1:53:22] had measure of that Faith of Our Lord
[1:53:26] Jesus
[1:53:30] Christ and not only use that faith in
[1:53:33] Acts of
[1:53:35] power but with those who dare to say
[1:53:39] that they were saved simply on the
[1:53:41] grounds of joining a
[1:53:47] church you can use this Faith which we
[1:53:50] have given
[1:53:52] Amen to command
[1:53:54] power to command the sick to be healed
[1:53:57] to command a demon to go are you hearing
[1:54:00] me is the Faith of Our Lord Jesus
[1:54:03] Christ and how do we get it by
[1:54:07] hearing the word of
[1:54:11] God
[1:54:13] listen they knew that no man could truly
[1:54:18] believe eternal life and the
[1:54:21] righteousness of God
[1:54:23] apart from the measure of the faith of
[1:54:25] the Lord Jesus
[1:54:27] Christ
[1:54:29] himself as today's church is filled with
[1:54:32] mental
[1:54:36] believers who end the Virgin
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:45] birth shed
[1:54:47] blood they believe in it going to church
[1:54:51] and taking
[1:54:52] communion and are not reborn at
[1:54:57] all even so in that third
[1:55:00] age was the same problem and I want to
[1:55:03] say the same problem
[1:55:05] now human Faith wasn't enough
[1:55:10] then and it is not enough
[1:55:12] now it takes the very faith of the Son
[1:55:15] of
[1:55:17] God
[1:55:19] to drop into a man's heart
[1:55:24] so that he can receive the Lord Of
[1:55:27] Glory into the temple not made
[1:55:32] withu this was a living
[1:55:35] faith and brother bam says I live by the
[1:55:38] faith of the Son of
[1:55:43] God Paul did not say that he lived by
[1:55:45] the faith in the Son of
[1:55:49] God it was the faith of the son
[1:55:53] God that given him
[1:55:57] life and kept him living in Christian
[1:56:04] Victory Walking In Christ Living in
[1:56:08] Christ means living with the faith of
[1:56:10] the Son of
[1:56:13] God exercising your faith
[1:56:16] daily until you receive the
[1:56:19] victory no they had not denied that
[1:56:22] salvation was Supernatural from start to
[1:56:28] finish they kept alive the truth of his
[1:56:33] name and his
[1:56:35] faith and they were blessed by the Lord
[1:56:38] and accounted worthy of
[1:56:42] him that's why he says whatsoever you
[1:56:44] bind on
[1:56:46] us be found in heaven whatever you lose
[1:56:49] on Earth shall be lose in heaven that's
[1:56:52] why we have the
[1:56:53] authority to command demons and Powers
[1:56:56] that's why we have the authority Amen to
[1:56:59] bring about amen the moving of the
[1:57:02] mountain we don't even now brother says
[1:57:04] pray in the name of
[1:57:08] Jesus but we speak by the authority of
[1:57:12] Jesus and the things shall
[1:57:15] happen where do we even get Authority
[1:57:18] it's not
[1:57:19] us it's not even our faith is by the
[1:57:22] faith of the Son of
[1:57:24] God
[1:57:26] Son what must I do to be
[1:57:29] saved what must I do to be saved believe
[1:57:34] on the Lord Jesus
[1:57:35] Christ and when you believe on him you
[1:57:38] believe on him by grace
[1:57:42] through faith none of works that any man
[1:57:47] should boast it's a gift of
[1:57:50] God not of yourself
[1:57:52] is the gift of God repent every one of
[1:57:55] you Bap in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:57:57] Christ and he shall receive the gift of
[1:58:00] thehost there it is the gift of God and
[1:58:05] when a man receives it in his
[1:58:07] life then you are represent a
[1:58:11] representative of
[1:58:15] Heaven you are saved you have received
[1:58:18] eternal life here on Earth that's why it
[1:58:22] is impossible for you to say you're
[1:58:23] going to the rure
[1:58:27] the and the gift you don't have to do
[1:58:30] anything to get
[1:58:31] it you just have to
[1:58:33] believe this man believed that same
[1:58:36] night midnight the says he was
[1:58:41] baptized baptism is not an
[1:58:44] act of
[1:58:46] self is an Act of Faith
[1:58:52] that shows that you have believed and
[1:58:54] when he was
[1:58:56] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:58:58] Christ he received the
[1:59:01] gift if you don't have the gift of the
[1:59:04] Holy Spirit and you baptized you are too
[1:59:08] late you too late the only people I see
[1:59:12] in the Bible taking so long to receive
[1:59:15] the Holy
[1:59:17] Spirit how
[1:59:19] long 10 days 1 2 3 3 4 5
[1:59:23] 6
[1:59:26] 10 10
[1:59:28] days not 20 not 30 not one month not two
[1:59:32] years you can't stay in church hearing
[1:59:35] the word believing it and you don't
[1:59:37] receive the it's
[1:59:41] impossible it's
[1:59:43] impossible the longest was
[1:59:47] 10 is more willing to give it to you
[1:59:49] than you are willing
[1:59:53] what must I do believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:59:56] chist so if you don't have the Holy
[1:59:58] Spirit even now I'd like you to stand
[2:00:02] up all of us that us stand and ask him
[2:00:05] to
[2:00:07] feel if you if you believe with all your
[2:00:10] heart if you believe with all your
[2:00:14] heart it's not something off from the
[2:00:16] moon or something we
[2:00:19] attain it is something that is here
[2:00:22] present with
[2:00:23] us and it gives to every
[2:00:27] believer maybe you've not understood
[2:00:30] everything maybe you can go back and
[2:00:32] watch
[2:00:34] this and um try to meditate on those
[2:00:39] words as you continue in
[2:00:41] prayer and
[2:00:43] consecration let us pray father in the
[2:00:46] name of our Lord
[2:00:48] Jesus we thank
[2:00:50] you because of this faith of the son
[2:00:54] of we
