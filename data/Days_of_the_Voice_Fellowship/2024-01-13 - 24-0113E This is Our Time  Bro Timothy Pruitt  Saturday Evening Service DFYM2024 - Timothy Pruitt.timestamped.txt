[1:34:36] Jubilee amen I believe we are in the
[1:34:38] Year of
[1:34:40] Jubilee amen that every captive can go
[1:34:45] free Jesus would take the scripture and
[1:34:47] he would begin to read
[1:34:50] it and he would lay it down and he would
[1:34:53] say this day the scripture is
[1:34:59] fulfilled the prophet said he was giving
[1:35:01] forth a warning of the coming forth of
[1:35:04] the great gusher of
[1:35:11] Pentecost to set at Liberty anyone that
[1:35:14] was a slave to
[1:35:18] sin amen anyone that was bound could go
[1:35:23] free and we know the Jubilee
[1:35:26] Year God told told the
[1:35:30] Israelites he said I want to I want you
[1:35:32] to remember that one time you were
[1:35:37] slaves and I came down and freed
[1:35:40] you and I want to make a day that at the

[1:36:00] lands and be free of every
[1:36:03] debt for it is a time of
[1:36:07] Liberty and every slave when he heard
[1:36:09] that Jubilee
[1:36:13] sound maybe he was Ro a ho in a row of
[1:36:18] tomatoes he could throw that hoe down
[1:36:22] and he could look at them at his slave
[1:36:25] master and he could say I am a free
[1:36:28] man I couldn't do nothing on my
[1:36:31] own but I have heard the trumpet
[1:36:35] sound and I believe that what the voices
[1:36:38] said and I don't have to hold one more
[1:36:43] roow brother R said we were also slaves
[1:36:47] to
[1:36:48] sin we were born in sin we were shaped

[1:37:17] free amen the trumpet is the gospel it
[1:37:21] is the good news you are no longer bound

[1:37:42] Paid a Debt a debt that I ow when I
[1:37:46] couldn't pay it on my own he came down
[1:37:50] and struck it all off and he said you

[1:49:52] rebellious boys were giv
[1:49:56] lies
[1:49:59] am let me let me here tell you what the
[1:50:01] prophet said he said the day of Miracle
[1:50:05] is not p as says the
[1:50:13] theologians if the day of Miracles is
[1:50:16] passed the day of God is passed
[1:50:19] Hallelujah
[1:50:24] God is a
[1:50:29] miracle you say when they say the days
[1:50:31] of Miracles are
[1:50:33] passed he said when the day of Miracles
[1:50:35] passed the day of God is
[1:50:39] passed certainly the days of Miracles
[1:50:42] will never be passed
[1:50:46] hallelu never was and never will be
[1:50:54] when God told
[1:50:56] Moses I'll send an angel before you to
[1:50:59] keep you in the
[1:51:01] way and bring you into a place that I
[1:51:04] have
[1:51:07] prepared hallelujah hallelujah to bring
[1:51:09] you into a place that I have
[1:51:12] prepared sorry that angel was
[1:51:16] Christ it was the angel of the Covenant
[1:51:20] but still many people didn't believe
[1:51:23] it there's still people today that don't
[1:51:25] believe
[1:51:26] it but the men who rejected the
[1:51:30] light they went into a total
[1:51:33] darkness and he said I believe
[1:51:36] today those who reject the Holy
[1:51:39] Spirit In The Light Of
[1:51:42] God the days of Miracles and so
[1:51:45] forth you will go back into total
[1:51:48] darkness
[1:51:52] you see Pharaoh's
[1:51:54] heart how dark
[1:51:58] it it got so dark and so
[1:52:03] hard he said listen what am I trying to
[1:52:05] say to
[1:52:07] you that God who came out and led the
[1:52:09] Church of God out of
[1:52:12] Egypt from bondage into
[1:52:16] Freedom has come down again in the same
[1:52:19] manner
[1:52:21] to lead the church spiritual out of the
[1:52:24] bondage of sin
[1:52:27] first by the Holy
[1:52:30] Spirit sickness
[1:52:32] next and the third step is to go into
[1:52:37] Glory take this Mortal and make it
[1:52:43] immortality but God called an
[1:52:46] exodus it was a separating time
[1:52:51] God was making ready to fulfill his
[1:52:53] Divine word he had given to
[1:52:58] Abraham he had made a promise to Abraham
[1:53:02] and Isaac and
[1:53:04] Jacob hundreds of years had
[1:53:07] passed but God never forgets a
[1:53:13] promise in the
[1:53:15] season in the
[1:53:17] time God will bring it to pass
[1:53:22] you can rest assur that what God has
[1:53:25] promised God will
[1:53:29] fulfill it might look
[1:53:32] impossible it might be years since he
[1:53:36] said but God said it his word will be
[1:53:40] fulfilled it will come to
[1:53:44] pass and here they
[1:53:47] are Moses now on the back side of a
[1:53:51] desert tending some
[1:53:54] sheep and one morning he gets
[1:53:57] up and he looks on the side of a
[1:54:00] hill man I need to wipe my
[1:54:03] eyes I see a bush up there it's on fire
[1:54:07] but it's not
[1:54:09] burning I want to go back I want to go
[1:54:11] see what this is all
[1:54:12] about and he goes to the
[1:54:15] bush and then out of the Bush comes a a
[1:54:18] voice
[1:54:22] and it knew
[1:54:26] Moses it didn't call him

[1:54:34] Moses
[1:54:35] Moses take off your shoes for you're
[1:54:39] standing on Holy

[1:54:50] I've heard their cry and I have come
[1:54:53] down to deliver

[1:55:09] thought you was nothing but a worthless
[1:55:12] nobody you said nobody cares nobody
[1:55:17] understands but God heard you
[1:55:20] and he's come down to deliver you and to
[1:55:23] break that chain off your
[1:55:34] neck I'm going bring my people
[1:55:38] out so here
[1:55:40] Moses had tried on his own
[1:55:47] abilities he had heard you know of the
[1:55:50] uh he' been taught all of his life who
[1:55:52] he
[1:55:53] was that he was to be a deliverer of
[1:55:56] God's
[1:55:57] people so he tried he killed an
[1:56:01] Egyptian but now he's not going on his

[1:58:06] you there's a pillar of fire that's
[1:58:09] swirling in this building right

[1:58:30] Jubilee this is your moment for
[1:58:48] freedom
[1:58:54] you know he said what has happened
[1:58:56] today he said because our churches have
[1:58:58] become
[1:59:02] intellectual and we get smart
[1:59:09] ministers they don't have no use for the
[1:59:11] holy
[1:59:13] spirit in the way that it was back
[1:59:17] there it's something we don't need
[1:59:20] today it's the days that's
[1:59:23] passed we don't need the Holy Spirit to
[1:59:26] heal the SI we've got doctors
[1:59:33] now we don't need the Holy
[1:59:36] Spirit we are all intelligent
[1:59:39] people he said when you do
[1:59:42] that you take the lifeline out of the
[1:59:48] body
[1:59:51] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah a church
[1:59:55] that feels it don't need the Holy
[1:59:58] Spirit man will stand up and give you an
[2:00:01] intellectual
[2:00:04] talk didn't Jesus
[2:00:06] say he would to see the very elected if
[2:00:08] it was
[2:00:13] possible intellectual talks will be so
[2:00:18] smooth
[2:00:19] it would deceive the
[2:00:21] people it's the men who can handle that
[2:00:24] word in such a
[2:00:27] way they're but they're trusting in
[2:00:29] their
[2:00:32] intellectuals and they condemn the holy
[2:00:38] spirit this is where we're at we've got
[2:00:41] people that say we don't need it no
[2:00:44] more with the perfect word has come we
[2:00:48] don't need shout we don't need dancing
[2:00:50] we don't need none of that no
[2:00:54] more the perfect word has
[2:00:57] come so the part is done away
[2:01:04] with what that simply
[2:01:07] means is the whole word has
[2:01:11] come so just having a
[2:01:14] part is done away
[2:01:16] with now we have all of it

[2:28:17] this is
[2:28:26] your you got just a moment let you have
[2:28:30] your seats just a
[2:28:36] second I'll just tell you a personal
[2:28:38] testimony for a
[2:28:41] moment I came here 30 years
[2:28:45] ago
[2:28:47] come to Kenya and Uganda actually Uganda
[2:28:50] I was about 18y old
[2:28:53] boy and uh you know just a I was born in
[2:28:57] a message
[2:28:58] home my my my dad's one of the one of
[2:29:01] the elders in the message great
[2:29:05] Min but I had to have more than
[2:29:08] [Music]
[2:29:10] that but when I came here it sparked
[2:29:13] Something In My
[2:29:15] Heart and I and I began to search and
[2:29:19] look I had pushed all thoughts of ever
[2:29:21] being a preacher
[2:29:23] out I don't understand anybody that
[2:29:26] wants to be a
[2:29:30] preacher I'm sorry I don't understand
[2:29:33] you it was not me I didn't want it I'd
[2:29:38] have been a preacher's
[2:29:39] kid I've been under the
[2:29:43] microscope I didn't want none of
[2:29:45] that but God has other
[2:29:49] plans and he knows how to get you where
[2:29:51] he want
[2:29:52] you went through a lot of nose in the
[2:29:55] dirt you know he'll drag you if he has
[2:29:58] to he'll drag you if he has
[2:30:00] to nose all in your mouth and your teeth
[2:30:04] your dirt's all in there dirt's all in
[2:30:07] your mouth
[2:30:09] teeth but he'll get you there and he got
[2:30:13] me
[2:30:14] there and about 2,000 I gave myself to
[2:30:17] him for the service of the
[2:30:21] Lord been preaching ever
[2:30:24] since but you know there was a lot of
[2:30:26] complexes I
[2:30:28] faced a lot of things that I you know
[2:30:31] people would say or
[2:30:33] whatever you know people would still
[2:30:35] make the statement well he's a preacher
[2:30:37] because he don't want to
[2:30:40] work I don't understand that either it
[2:30:44] was a lot easier on the job I had
[2:30:48] but you know you you all these things
[2:30:50] begin to build up complexes and
[2:30:54] things so God would lead me even more
[2:30:57] into full-time
[2:30:59] Ministry I've been in full-time Ministry
[2:31:03] now since about 09
[2:31:08] 2010 so
[2:31:11] I yeah so I I
[2:31:15] um know still you'd go through
[2:31:18] things resentment because
[2:31:21] you you know towards the Lord because
[2:31:23] you didn't want this you know resentment
[2:31:26] towards the
[2:31:28] Lord because you didn't want
[2:31:40] this you know anytime a hard time would
[2:31:44] come say well I I don't want how I
[2:31:46] didn't want it anyway you
[2:31:47] know so go through a lot of
[2:31:52] complexes and brother you know uh I I
[2:31:55] would always try to do something on my
[2:31:57] own to make a some extra
[2:32:01] money and uh so I would do various
[2:32:03] little jobs and what have
[2:32:06] you and so I uh just just case you don't
[2:32:10] know you don't get rich
[2:32:15] preaching
[2:32:24] I'm doing this on purpose so just bear
[2:32:27] with
[2:32:29] me but I was looking to maybe go into
[2:32:32] business
[2:32:34] again so I went to visit brother Ron
[2:32:36] Spencer's
[2:32:38] Church brother Ron's A Gifted Man Of
[2:32:44] God I went to his house for a dinner and
[2:32:48] things never mentioned one time about
[2:32:50] going into
[2:32:52] business that night we would go
[2:32:56] to
[2:32:59] oh yeah I I I I um I didn't mention one
[2:33:03] thing about it so we went to church that
[2:33:06] night brother Ron came up to me he say
[2:33:10] going to be a great
[2:33:12] weekend especially for
[2:33:14] you I thought oh wow maybe God's got a
[2:33:18] word go into business you
[2:33:21] know and so we go up on the mountain the
[2:33:24] next day and we're up there and he he
[2:33:27] pulls me
[2:33:29] aside he said Timothy you was at my
[2:33:31] house
[2:33:33] yesterday he said I went to go take a
[2:33:35] nap after you left lay
[2:33:38] down he said the Lord told me to get up
[2:33:40] and go to my
[2:33:42] office and I sat down at my office and I
[2:33:46] begin to think about things and the
[2:33:49] voice of God begin to
[2:33:51] speak and says don't you tell Timothy
[2:33:54] don't go into
[2:33:57] business but he is my
[2:33:59] servant and I will take care of
[2:34:03] him and I saw God do miraculous
[2:34:07] things take care of bills and things I

[3:39:37] a an ambition in politics
[3:39:43] but that
[3:39:44] moment when it came to
[3:39:46] him he came to me and said these
[3:39:52] words I've decided to quit
[3:39:57] politics and I'm going to serve the
[3:40:00] Lord I never asked him to do
[3:40:03] that God vised
[3:40:06] here and God he has a lot of ability
[3:40:11] a very intelligent
[3:40:13] man he passed very well did a degree in
[3:40:18] law but when this message came to
[3:40:21] him it turned him
[3:40:24] around and I'm saying this
[3:40:27] specifically because you're going to
[3:40:29] hear him
[3:40:30] tomorrow and you will know the power of
[3:40:34] this
[3:40:35] message this message that we talking to
[3:40:38] you
[3:40:39] about is not a man's
[3:40:41] idea it's not a man's knowledge it's not
[3:40:45] even
[3:40:46] quot it's a life
[3:40:49] changer when God met
[3:40:52] me turned me
[3:40:54] around at one place I wanted to be a
[3:40:56] movie
[3:40:58] actor go turn me
[3:41:04] around he made a preacher out of
[3:41:08] me pray
[3:41:11] this message is
[3:41:12] real that's the reason we are preparing
[3:41:17] this bring anointed
[3:41:21] ministers to let you
[3:41:24] experience the power of this
[3:41:27] message you may sit down in your local
[3:41:31] church and think it's just
[3:41:37] ques it's a power if can yield
[3:41:41] yourself it will turn you
[3:41:43] around some of you are going on a wrong
[3:41:45] path of
[3:41:47] life but these meetings have the
[3:41:50] potential of changing your destiny
