So don't be so spiritual that I can't dance. You can dance for the Lord. You're not dancing for your neighbor. I'm not dancing for you. If I'm here dancing for the Lord, I'm dancing for the Lord, not for you. One more time. You're going to add some speed. mighty. Oh mighty. Oh no. Oh. Oh. Why?

Well, without wasting any more time, we just have a few minutes to hear the word and we have all the time. So, we want brother Ken to come and, you know, have his liberty this morning. I've always enjoyed brother Ken speak. I know he's going to be a blessing to us. Amen. Amen. Uh, brother Brian, let's do that one more time. We are learning the song. Amen. And then you will usher in brother Ken. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's sing it once more. might. Oh, why do I feel now? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't we give the Lord a mighty shout? Why don't we tell the Lord, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. We praise you, Father." &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; we are gathered this morning once again for there's always about the morning Father, the beginning of a new day, new hopes, new ambitions and aspirations, and even new expectations. Father, we thank you for this opportunity that you've given us that as young people, we can come together, lift our voices in praise, sit under the teaching of your word that Lord, you can be able to align us with the purpose of God concerning our life. We surrender ourselves to you, Father. Songs of Zion have gone forth. Now it has come a time. Lord, as I stand behind this sacred desk and as your servant, I'm reporting to duty. I pray that you'll have your own way. Lord, may you take the little thoughts and break the bread of life for us. May this service mark a good beginning for us as we even set a pace for the meetings ahead. May your Holy Spirit pick us up and place us in those heavenly places that Lord Jesus Christ this day we shall be real eagles that will get to soar higher and higher in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We are quite pressed for time. &gt;&gt; So, we'll just go into the uh scriptures as we appreciate our host pastor. Thank you uh pastor. It's always a blessing to be in this camp. I may not get maybe another chance to say this, but I I appreciate you and I've always said it. We'll always be here to support and stand behind the man of God. We thank the Lord for yet another time. as we open in John chapter one. Uh I want you to preach with me this morning because I want to give a disclaimer. This is not what I plan to preach on. So I really want you to preach with me. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. This brother is saying this is not what he was planning to preach on. Is he not prayed up? By God's grace, I've prayed up. By God's grace, I've studied. &gt;&gt; But I just felt the Lord leading a different direction. The book of book of John chapter one from verse 35. Again, the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold the lamb of God. And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus. There's something happening here. This is the second time that Jesus is being introduced by John. The previous day Jesus had come and he was baptized. And you remember John had introduced him. Behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. But I want you to notice nobody caught that. It was a change of ministry. But nobody caught it. But on the second day, two disciples heard and they followed Jesus. &gt;&gt; They realized it was a time when Jesus is here, John must decrease, Jesus must increase. So they were able to realize that we no longer need to rely on the sacrifices of bulls and goats. Why? The lamb of God is here and they followed Jesus. And this is why we have a testimony in the book of acts that there were those that were baptized according to the baptism of John and they were asking we didn't even hear about the baptism in Jesus name because their eyes had not been opened at that time but the bible gives us a testimony there were two that follow Jesus and the bible goes down in the ch uh verse 44 before now Philip was of Bethider the city of Andrew and Peter. &gt;&gt; Philip findeth Nathaniel and said unto him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." We've found the fulfillment of scriptures for our day. And Nathaniel said unto him, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip saith unto him, &gt;&gt; "Come and see, &gt;&gt; precious Lord, May you take this scripture father and break it for us. Open our eyes of understanding that we can see Lord from this text that we shall be speaking on. Precious Holy Spirit. May you give the context in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. You can take your seats. &gt;&gt; Uh for just a moment. I want to speak on can there any good thing come out of you? Can there any good thing come out of you? We know the scripture is talking about Nazareth. But now for a moment, I don't want us to look at Nazareth, a city in Israel. &gt;&gt; I want you to look at yourself. But just for a background, we see the events that are taking place here and the statement that Nathaniel makes is something I believe he was warranted to make because Nazareth was not known as a very good city. Maybe it was a place if you passed by at around 10:00 in the night, you'll maybe lose your phone and your wallet. You will meet some goons that will take away your things. Maybe it was a place if you wanted to have the local brew. We call it cha back home. That is the place where the best of the worst was being made in terms of sin. That is why maybe women were walking so naked. Adultery was on the rampage. and all these bad and evil things that were there at that time. It was a lowly city, nothing good could be said about it. And that is when Nathaniel was skeptical. Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? But I thank the Lord. As much as Philip had an answer, I want to bring the scripture into perspective now because we are living in the worst of all ages. We are living in an age where 200 million devils are on the rampage. We know that hell is open. We know that the devil is on the loose. That things are not going to get any better. We know the world is falling apart in dark ludicia where people are blind. They're naked. They're wretched. They're poor. They're miserable. IT IS THE WORST AND WORST of all conditions. You name it. LGBTQ IS on the rise. LGBTQ. Homosexuality is on the rise. Parent delinquency, CHILDREN DELINQUENCY. THE WORLD IS falling apart indeed. ECONOMIES ARE FAILING. Systems are crumbling. Can there ANY GOOD THING COME OUT OF CAMPALA THIS MORNING? CAN THERE BE ANY RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE THAT WILL stand in this day? MY ANSWER TODAY, COME AND SEE. COME AND SEE BECAUSE SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF YOU, BROTHER. SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF YOU, MY SISTER. YOU'VE GROWN IN A HOME. YOU'VE GROWN IN A HOME WHERE YOU'VE BEEN SCARRED. YOU'VE BEEN TRAUMATIZED. YOU'VE GROWN UP WITH WOUNDS. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T BELONG. YOU'VE GONE THROUGH BATTLE. THE DEVIL HAS SCARRED YOU. THE DEVIL HAS GIVEN YOU WOUNDS AND YOU'RE WONDERING, "AM I GOING TO MAKE IT? AM I REALLY RAPTURE MATERIAL? AM I REALLY THE PRIDE?" I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU. COME AND SEE because in THE MIDST OF IT ALL, THERE'S A PEOPLE. THERE'S A GENERATION, A GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? YOUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS IS FILTHY RUGS. YOUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS IS FILTHY RUGS BEFORE THE LORD. THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M NOT DEPENDING ON MY RIGHTEOUSNESS. DON'T DEPEND ON your righteousness BECAUSE NAZARETH COULD NOT DEPEND ON ITS NAME ANYMORE. NAZARETH HAD A BAD NAME. BUT THERE WAS ONE THING. THERE WAS ONE MAN, CAN I TELL YOU HIS NAME? &gt;&gt; HE IS CALLED THE DIFFERENCE MAKER. &gt;&gt; AND I'm introducing to you today, CHRIST. THE DIFFERENCE MAKER. HOW BAD IS YOUR SITUATION? JUST AT CHRIST. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO CHRIST, THE MOUTH OF CHRIST, CHRIST is a DIFFERENCE MAKER. ONE TIME Elisha goes to the school of prophets. They didn't know HOW TO GIVE THE proper food. They took some wild guads and they put THEM IN THE POT. WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT? THERE WAS DEATH IN THE PORT. AND WHEN DEATH WAS IN THAT PORT, HERE COMES A PROPHET WITH A REVELATION. WHEN THERE IS DEATH IN THE PORT, SHALL BRING CHRIST AND HE TOOK A MEAL OFFERING, WHICH IS THE TYPE OF CHRIST, WHICH IS THE TYPE OF THE WORD, AND HE PUT IT IN THE POT, AND HE PUT IT IN THE POT. THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WERE CRYING, THERE IS DEATH IN THE POT, THEY NOW SANG A NEW SONG. I HAVE NEVER EATEN FOOD LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS? IT WAS CHRIST THE DIFFERENCE. I DON'T CARE HOW BAD YOUR SITUATION IS, JUST BRING CHRIST. ARE YOU DEAD SPIRITUALLY? BRING CHRIST. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU DEAD IN YOUR PRAYER LIFE? BRING CHRIST. DON'T YOU KNOW HOW TO READ THE MESSAGE? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU LOOKING FOR REVELATION? DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE? &gt;&gt; CHRIST THE DIFFERENCE MAKER. &gt;&gt; PREACH THE DIFFERENCE. AMEN. We are putting things into perspective now. We are putting things into perspective because all the GOOD PREACHINGS, ALL THE WONDERFUL REVELATIONS that will come from this sacred death WITHOUT CHRIST WILL AMOUNT TO NOTHING. BUT WITH CHRIST, SOMETHING GOOD WILL COME OUT OF NAZARETH. BECAUSE AS LONG AS JESUS WAS IN NAZARETH, THERE IS SOMETHING WE CALL THERE WAS a possibility. &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO TELL YOU TODAY THERE IS A POSSIBILITY. &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS IS IN NAZARETH, the lame COULD WALK. THE BLIND COULD SEE. THE SICK WILL BE HEALED. THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED. SO TELL ME CHURCH, &gt;&gt; CAN SOMETHING GOOD &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF NAZARETH? AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Jesus is there, &gt;&gt; something good can come OUT OF NAZARETH. AND IN YOUR SITUATION, JUST BRING JESUS. AND LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS, JESUS KEEPS ALL HIS APPOINTMENT. NO MATTER HOW BAD THE SITUATION IS, YOU THINK THAT your life is filthy. Let me tell you, he went to the grave OF LAZARUS THAT WAS THINKING THAT WAS SMELLING BUT BRING JESUS. LAZARUS &gt;&gt; COME FORTH &gt;&gt; AND IN THIS MEETINGS THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE LAZARUS THEY ARE DEAD THEY ARE STINKING BUT TO THAT EQUATION BRING JESUS AND I CAN TELL YOU FOR SURE WHEN JESUS CAME HE DIDN'T SAY COME FORTH AND THE PROPHET OF GOD TELLS US &gt;&gt; THAT IF JESUS WOULD HAVE SAID COME FORTH THEN ALL THE GRAVES WOULD HAVE OPENED. BUT JESUS is a particular man. JESUS IS SPECIFIC TO the dots. The preaching OF THE WORD IS THE CALLING of the name. When the preacher IS PREACHING, HE MAY NOT MENTION YOUR NAME, BUT HE CAN MENTION YOUR CONDITION. HE CAN MENTION YOUR SITUATION. THAT IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO SIT READY BECAUSE RIGHT THERE, DEATH IS ABOUT TO LOSE ITS GRIP. SIN IS ABOUT TO LOSE ITS GRIP. THAT ADDICTION IS ABOUT TO LOSE ITS SCRIPTURE BECAUSE THE PREACHING OF THE WORD IS THE CALLING OF THE NAMES. AND WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR NAME, YOU SAID JESUS, &gt;&gt; HERE I AM. RESPOND BROTHER, RESPOND, SISTER, MAY WE NOT COME TO THIS PLACE AND GO THE WAY WE CAME BECAUSE CHRIST THE DIFFERENCE MAKER. IN THE CUP TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Jesus is in the camp. &gt;&gt; What's your need? &gt;&gt; What's your trouble? &gt;&gt; Do you have to wait until the last service? You have to wait until tomorrow. My moment will be on the last service. That is when I'm going to RECEIVE MY BREAKTHROUGH. JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; IS THE SAME YESTERDAY AND EVEN RIGHT NOW &gt;&gt; AND IN THE OTHER SERVICES RESPOND &gt;&gt; TO THE CALLING OF YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Haven't we feasted? Haven't we feasted? &gt;&gt; Haven't we feasted? But I have a question for you. What happens next? We heard about the disguised ministry and the anointing of the lion. If you fail to identify yourself WITH THAT, ALL that becomes intellectual knowledge. But I want to see yourself like a David. David didn't know WHO HE REALLY WAS. THE COMING OF SAMUEL. SAMUEL was the one carrying the mystery of his life. HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT I'm just a little shepherd boy that has been sidelined by my family. AT THE COMING OF SOMEONE MADE HIM REALIZE YOU ARE ORDAINED TO be a king. HE WAS ANOINTED. HE WAS ELECTED. HE WAS ANOINTED WAITING for the placement AT SOME POINT AND THE MESSAGE HAS COME SO THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY THAT even before the foundation OF THE WORLD SAINTS. COME ON. COME ON CHURCH. WE HAVE RECEIVED A POWERFUL MESSAGE. OUR SEL HAS COME WITH THE REVELATION OF WHO WE ARE. I am going to tell you this morning what was in the BACK PART OF GOD'S mind before God was God and what did he say you were there I I wish you had the time to read the scriptures &gt;&gt; the Bible the book of Job who can get A CLEAN THING OUT OF AN UNCLEAN THING. WHO CAN GET A RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE? OUT OF DARK LUDITION, WHO CAN DO THAT? CHRIST, &gt;&gt; THE DIFFERENCE MAKER. AMEN. Are you seeing it? &gt;&gt; This is the main thing. YOU AND I TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH A JOSHUA AND CALB GENERATION. THE ONE THING THAT CALB REALIZED knew there's a portion for ME AND YOUR FAITH NEEDS TO RISE TO THAT LEVEL WHERE YOU KNOW RAPTURE IS MINE. BODY CHANGE IS MIND. THE HOLY GHOST IS MINE. BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT REALIZATION WE WILL BE COMING TO CAMP AFTER CAMP AFTER CAMP. BUT REALIZE YOU ARE THOSE LITTLE ONES IN THE LITTLE BOOK AND I SAW ANOTHER MIGHTY ANGEL COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN WITH AN OPEN BOOK IN HIS HAND. WHAT WERE THE CONTENTS OF THAT BOOK? YOU. WHY IN THAT BOOK? AMEN. &gt;&gt; And at this time, he's coming to redeem HIS OWN. YOU AND I, THAT WERE IN THE PAWN SHOP, THAT WERE IN FILNESS. BUT IT COMES TO SAY, "THIS IS NOT YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE. YOUR PLACE IS RIGHT BY MY SIDE. AND WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT, SIN WILL shake off from you because YOU SEE YOUR LIFE IS PRE-PLANNED. SO NOW YOU'RE CHECKING YOUR CURRENT CONDITION with a blueprint THAT GOD PUT DOWN. SO IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE BLUEPRINT, YOU BECOME LIKE THAT LITTLE EGO WHO KNEW WHEN SHE WATCHED THE MAMA EGO IN THE SKY. SHE SAW herself big like mine. No wonder I was not able to eat the grain wings like mine. &gt;&gt; CLOTHES LIKE MINE. &gt;&gt; But here's the thing. &gt;&gt; The little igllet had never exercised. Amen. Amen. GOD PUT YOU HERE to be a king and a priest BUT YOU HAVE NEVER EXERCISED. So when the realization STRIKES YOU now start EXERCISING AS A KING MINE IS TO RULE. &gt;&gt; I rule over sin. I rule over the flesh. I RULE OVER MY PHONE. I RULE OVER MY LAPTOP. I RULE OVER MY TIME. I RULE OVER MY FEET. I RULE OVER MY EYES. I RULE OVER MY HANDS. WHY? I AM A KING. SO IF YOU ALLOW YOURSELF to live below THE STANDARD OF A KING, THAT IS UP TO YOU. BUT YOU NEED TO know &gt;&gt; the realization of relationship. He didn't come to make him a son. He was already a SON TO START WITH. THE FATHER just needed to align his thinking his CONDUCT SO THAT he can behave like a son. YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A DAUGHTER of God. AND THE PREACHING OF THE WORD IS COMING TO MAKE YOU ALIGN with who you really are. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. So we see that nothing good would have been said about Nazareth. Nothing good could be said about you maybe. But one thing stands for sure. When Christ the difference maker comes on the scene, he makes everything all right. Let's pick Abraham, an old man with a promise of God. He tried to work things out his own way. He caught Ishmael instead catching up with him. And God waited until that time. that he was old, his skin was wrinkled, there was no strength in him. SARAH'S WOMB WAS DEAD. There was no way she could have had pleasure with her husband. BUT AT THAT POINT, THAT IS WHEN GOD COMES. WHEN THE SITUATION IS BAD, YOU YOUR STRENGTH HAS FAILED. YOUR ABILITIES HAVE COME TO AN END. THEN HE COMES AND SAYS, "I AM EL SHAI THE STRENGTH GIVER, &gt;&gt; THE DOUBLE BREASTED GOD. &gt;&gt; COME AND NURSE FROM ME AND WE COME TO CAMP SO THAT WE CAN NURSE FROM HIM. COME AND NURSE. COME AND GET SOME STRENGTH." WHY? THERE'S A POSSIBILITY IN THIS WORST CONDITION. SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF ABRAHAM. SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF S. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. Let's look at Samson. Someone that we know had really failed terribly. He gave his strength to God. But he's had two women and it got to a point where his sh his his head was shaved. We were speaking about restoration yesterday, right? And you are living in another time of restoration. Maybe you've been having some delila over the years and they have shaved OFF YOUR HAIR. THEY HAVE SHAVED OFF YOUR glory and you now feel like a waste. There is nothing good that can come out of you. Samson remembered one thing. Samson remembered the parents. Samson remembered the mother. SAMSON REMEMBERED THE FATHER. WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO SAMSON? SAMSON WAS BEING RESTORED. AND WHEN HE REALIZED that I have fallen from the standard that God had given to my parents. AND WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE FALLEN FROM THE STANDARD THAT GOD GAVE THE APOSTLES, THEN you get INTO A CONDITION WHERE YOU START LOOKING UP TO GOD AND TELL GOD, ONE MORE TIME. AND SAMSON WAS THERE AND HE HAPPENED TO TOUCH HIS HEAD ONE TIME AND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS some hair that had grown. AND GOD BRING YOU TO A PLACE WHERE YOU ARE CONNECTED WITH YOUR HEAD WHICH IS CHRIST AND YOU CAN TOUCH HIM and you can feel that he's there. Hallelujah. Do not do not overthink it. But when I'm speaking about your head, I'm speaking about Christ. I'M SPEAKING ABOUT A HEAD. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT a literal head. BECAUSE WHEN SAMSON TOUCHED THE HEAD, SAMSON FELT the hair and he knew the covenant is joined WITH THE HAIR. AS LONG AS MY GLORY IS THERE, THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY. AND AS LONG AS I'M IN THE WORD, AS LONG AS I'M ONE WITH THE WORD, WHATSOEVER YOU ASK IN MY NAME, it shall be given unto you. So here was assumption eyes were gone, &gt;&gt; but the hair was still there. The prophet might be gone. The eyes stand for prophetic insight, but the hair was there. What was the hair? The headship was there. The glory was there. And Samson knew IF GOD HAS RESTORED MY HAIR, then definitely something good can come out of me. You've come to camp. If you're CRYING FOR RESTORATION, YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE because God IS A RESTORER. HE RESTORES YOUR JOY. HE RESTORES YOUR PEACE. WHATEVER THE ENEMY HAS TAKEN, THIS IS A TIME SOMETHING GOOD CAN COME OUT OF YOUR PROUD. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THE DEVIL IS WREING HOW THE enemy is blocking your way. He blocked the way of the children of Israel. And the prophet says that God looked down at the Red Sea with fiery angry eyes. So God looks at situations in YOUR LIFE THAT HINDER YOU and it is upon you. Can something good come OUT OF MOSES? SOMEONE that was weak RAISED IN EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE AND THERE CAME A TIME THAT HE MET God and God told him I have heard the cry of my children and I am NOW COME I HAVE NOT SENT AN ANGEL I I'VE COME. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID MOSES REALIZE? The seventh seal mystery broke before MOSES RIGHT THERE. WHAT IS THE SEVENTH SEAL? THE COMING OF THE LORD. MOSES REALIZED. IF I AM WAITING FOR GOD TO COME, IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO COME, YOU HAVE FAILED. BECAUSE MOSES REALIZED, I AM THE COMING OF THE LORD. REVELATION CHAPTER 19. BEHOLD, THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB HAS COME AND HIS WIFE HAS MADE HERSELF READY. WHAT WAS SHE DRESSED IN? I &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE PREACHING IN FRONT. WHAT IS THE BRIDE &gt;&gt; DRESSED IN? SHE IS DRESSED IN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF SAINTS. BROTHER, SISTER, REALIZE YOU ARE THE GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS. IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR SOMETHING UNTO YOU BECAUSE I CAME TO TELL YOU, YOU ARE THE FULFILLMENT of this scripture. So I'm asking this morning. Can something good come out of you? Can something good come out of you? I have an answer. Come to PDN. Come and see. The righteousness of God is here. The righteousness of God is here. Take the words with a strong hand of faith. And you will see the devil flee. What's your situation? What's your circumstance? Is it a bad name? Is it a bad name? Crush the difference maker. Is it a bad habit? Christ the difference maker. Is it a complex an addiction? The difference maker is right here. We are not depending on righteousness. We are depending on the righteousness of our Lord Jesus. In the message that day on Calvary, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Stand up on our feet. &gt;&gt; Says there's a highway made. There's a telephone set in there. There's a line to glory. Brings every person in reach of that line. If a man is full of sin, it connected him in on central He can be forgiven of that sin. Not only that, but that sin is paid for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the righteousness we're talking about. We cannot depend on our own righteousness. We are depending on the finished work of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to say, "I'm not worthy. Sure you're not. &gt;&gt; You never could be. But a worthy one, took your place. He became sinner so that you CAN BECOME THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD. Where is the generation of the righteous? It is right. &gt;&gt; Abraham believed in God. And it was accounted to him for righteousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wanted to preach on righteousness by faith. But I feel those thoughts are streaming in now. But one took your place. You are free. You don't have to wonder anymore. You don't have to be a pleasure seeking man to open your eyes. For there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins. Sin has plunged beneath the blood. They lose all their guilty state. Catch this now. You don't have to be lost. &gt;&gt; You don't HAVE TO BE LOST. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE LOST. &gt;&gt; You don't have TO LIVE IN SIN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE FETED. You don't have TO LIVE SHACKLED. DO NOT BE like ch that he was set free but was a prison in his mind. He is set free but doesn't want to fly because his mind IS ALREADY CAGED. DO not be a crow. Be an eagle. So you don't have to be lost. Something that has bound you doesn't have to bind you anymore. There's a highway and a way and it's called the way of holiness. The unclean don't pass over it. FOR HE COMES THROUGH THE FOUNTAIN FIRST and then he enters the highway. He broke the powers of Satan. He opened the prison doors of hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons fearing that when he died what death would be to him on Calvary he opened those cell doors. Let every captive go free. You don't have to no longer be torn DOWN BY SIN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO NO LONGER YIELD your members to sin, drinking, smoking, gambling, telling lies. YOU DON'T HAVE TO YIELD your members to sin. You don't HAVE TO YIELD YOUR MEMBERS TO GOSSIP. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO lead your members TO FEEL THE LIVING. PORNOGRAPHY IN THE FIELD OF THIS WORLD. YOU DON'T have to yield your members to immorality. You don't have to yield your members TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE FASHIONS of this world. You can be honest. You can be honest. Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN BE HONEST. YOU CAN BE JUST, YOU CAN BE UPRIGHT. YOU CAN BE RIGHTEOUS. YOU CAN BE HOLY. YOU CAN BE AN OVERCOMER. WHY? WE ARE NOT RELYING ON OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. JESUS PAID IT ALL. ALL TO HIM I OWE. You can be honest. &gt;&gt; I would really want us to read this. You can be honest. You can be just You can be upright. You can read your Bible and pray every day. You can read the message every day. You can be getting time to consecrate yourself before THE LORD EVERY DAY. YES, YOU CAN. IN THE MIDST OF LICIA, WHERE PEOPLE ARE SO BUSY, YOU CAN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; This last part is what I want you to see. And I do not know why the devil is fighting it. The message that day on Calvary, paragraph 64, you love the Lord Jesus. Once I finish this, I'll be done. But I feel like if I go without using this or without us reading this, my mission will be accomplished. Do you love the Lord? Do you believe you're the generation of the righteous? My righteousness is filthy rags before him. But his righteousness upon me, he will accept. So today in this camp we are stripping off the old garments. Amen. When the prodigal son came back, &gt;&gt; he laid aside the old tattered garments and the father called for the best robe. This is what we are doing. Your righteousness has to be stripped and you have to be clothed in the righteousness of God. Have you seen it? Paragraph 64. The message that day on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You don't have the table. This is this is a song. Ah yes. This is it. You don't have to no longer yield your members to sin. cheating, smoking, gambling, telling lies. You can be honest, just and upright and Satan can do nothing about it. So yes, you Yes. in dark cloud in Satan's Eden where the people are worshiping the god of this evil. It is payback time Satan &gt;&gt; you came to my Eden and perverted what I had greed. But now the tables are turning right in Satan's edge. GOD IS PICKING HIMSELF A PEOPLE. GOD IS GETTING HIMSELF A BRIDE, A CHOSEN GENERATION, A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD, A PECULIAR PEOPLE, A GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS, AND SATAN CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. God bless you. Let's stand up. Amen. Amen. So today he's a bluff and he'll forever be a bluff. So as the preaching of the word goes forth. Receive it with joy. Receive it with faith. Possess the gates of THE ENEMY. FOOTSTEPS MEAN POSSESSION. THE DOOR IS OPEN FOR YOU.
