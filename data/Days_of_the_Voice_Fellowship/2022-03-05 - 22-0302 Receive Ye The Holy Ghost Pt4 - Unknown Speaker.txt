that you be very attentive let us see what the holy spirit will speak to you that's not how much time we take sharing the word how much we are blessed with and every spirit whenever you are coming to the service well you know service you believe that that will be your day and if you are already filled with the holy spirit and then whenever you are coming to the subject of service [Music] rapture comes together that morning arrives we shall realize that all the church services we had to go to guarantee all the bible scriptures we had to read hey i want to go up there believe it never tried to know all the quotes we had to read all the message books we had to read or listen we had to do oh you see how important it is for a believer to receive the holy spirit you know many people when they come to the message they think that it's all about understanding the mysteries of the message you know it's not more it's not just understanding the mysteries but as we will be able to see the revealed mysteries should be able to take us to the promised land be taken [Music] the holy spirit the person of jesus christ yes christ without having restored back to the revealed truth so we need to understand these things again and we see when jesus christ came and yesterday hallelujah amen where's by the shame i have too much stereo if you can be able to control that and give me a little more bass and decrease the stereo amen when jesus christ came yes he after resurrection he was able to meet the disciples yes and this was about his [Music] program when they met jesus there was a an an encounter one was in canada which brought a change i went through a change was evident that changed you see when [Music] when you are supposed to manifest the life of that claim that is when we shall not believe us and unbelievers that's when we shall know whether you have the holocaust or you [Music] when you have to manifest the light or you know god is sober that you claim to have with all garments it's when you can be able to know whether you have the holocaust or you do not i want to get it nobody knows is whereby hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord well come on that's the way apostle peter comes to our place and he meets jesus nasty cannabis and he had promised him i will be with you now when all my brothers of mine forsake you i will not forsake you i will die with you because i love [Music] because he did not have the holy ghost [Music] intellectual look at what is happening [Music] you fight with them [Music] the seed of god you don't they don't need to fast with the wife the spirit of god always believes hallelujah amen and so amen children whereby [Music] but we should come to a place [Music] [Music] let me tell you don't trust in a man there was a cigarette trust in a woman our trust is in the lord always great that's why but i'm saying organically it is not right for you to even this these are the things that make up this body but then we need to be born again that was the first life the first nature of the world dna in him that is and we can only be born into that child [Music] the true importance of the holy spirit the first stop god breathed the breath of life into adam yes so god jesus christ breathed the breath of life to the disciples but now uh as we will continue building on that i want us to tape it with israel and here was israel in the land of egypt israel and israel had a promise to result you remember before behold the christ the children of israel is coming to me and i have also seen the operation where with the egyptians oppressed hallelujah land okay a land flowing with milk and seeds and the believers but the banana says the believers went out and entered into the promised land organization they would not accept the message they perished with the rest of the animals but those who went to the promised land they had to receive the anointed message of the messenger what is it the purpose of that message [Music] it gives them [Music] [Music] there is an angel of death going all over the world he's going around every house there is no house he will not go to telling you going around every house the souls of men and men younger men young ladies the devil has intended but it's going to move around this generation this age of death i told you the devil has no problem if you can do his work best single korean minimum you can go to church you can even pay your tribe why won't everyone recommend you can even give money to the church you can be the best realizes people mean business we are talking about antibiotics but leave your younger ones leave the younger ones and you find in a message today many people young old ones who have believed the message when you see that children down the line this message is more than a teaching let me tell you what the message is this message you may not understand that right now but i'll explain hallelujah amen he said that they had to go to the promised land like the anointed message of the messenger the people knew nothing about the blood i went to bed until moses came on the scene are you following me what was the blood homosexuality that black was the only thing um that was going to stand before them between the people and the age of death [Music] the blood what is the end of death maracao it's the spirit of sin way more you're going to be the spirit of fornication the spirit of adultery all sexual perversion all through chinese [Applause] of death or america was sent down to me by once into egypt every house amen whether it is the house of the israelites oh it is the house of the egyptians it did not matter the arenas the age of death had full access full access but the only house the blood was [Music] jesus died on the bride under the cross yes yes two thousand years ago messiah which was shed on the cross not here in a there is no church passing milliliters and liters of the blood of jesus that was that's the chemistry since we are doing a little teaching here let me go let me let's read that part here is let us first read the first read second corinthians chapter 5 verse 19. [Music] quickly now the way that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation by the way second corinthians 5 9 yes 5 17 begin from 17 therefore if any man be in christ she is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things have become new amon crystal and all things are out of god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation [Music] [Music] [Music] there's quite many scriptures we can read but i think i will uh all right we can we could really join five but for stream five but i think we can skip that for now says okay you why don't you read first john 1 7. now yes and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin away hallelujah hallelujah then he says in revelation 1 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own [Music] and that is why when we are in christ creature alien because we are under the ministry of reconciliation reconciliation to reconcile means to bring back to uh to bring together two parties [Music] amen what desire to bring us back together with him and come here because he said the soul that sinneth that soul shall die [Music] so what was jesus ministry his ministry what is that was the ministry of reconciliation shedding his blood on the ground which is shot on the cross my brother my sister listen carefully your full attention here [Music] not imputing their trespasses unto them yeah that's why i cannot have a cast on me more that's why you cannot take the cast of cynical no longer hold on your life are you following me what has it done us the meaning the word of god because jesus yes oh hallelujah somebody get it please amen when jesus came on the earth yesterday he came with the ministry of reconciliation so where is the blood atom the blood is in the world oversight amen he said father he sent me number one to man so saying hallelujah amen you sent me to do what one to my question is the ministry of reconciliation back to you but now i live negative i also give them amen amen that's why this gospel drips with blood whenever we are preaching this gospel is the blood of jesus christ hallelujah and then you are reconciled hallelujah amen now of course there were also other false prophets you if what they have cannot be compared with this then this will swallow what they have done and things like that naming two names disorder in the church without interpretation they come with this without generio and we compare it with this [Music] when moses came down to egypt and you remember some time back i talked about moses moses staff was representing the [Music] i don't care how big they let me tell you this message you will see how powerful [Music] i can stand with this old bible any bible and i challenge the pope of rome i can't stand with this bible and challenge all the priests and challenge religious orders [Applause] you're preaching outside where they will ask themselves who are these people we thought they are against vertigo they are also against this false prophet it is by this you know what anointed word of the messenger come upstairs that will go to the promised land hallelujah a sound where you need to get in that game i'm waiting standing ready three minutes we're ready to take a kick think rosa you are garments by [Music] [Music] [Music] wife
