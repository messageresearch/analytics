[50:49] weekend whereby we are having a visiting
[50:55] Ministry and so as your pastor I thought
[50:59] at least I should give you one message
[51:00] in the
[51:04] week and so I thought I should speak
[51:08] tonight amen because on Wednesday we had
[51:10] brother
[51:11] ephra and then on Sunday we are going to
[51:14] have Pastor
[51:15] Gideon and so I thought I should speak
[51:21] tonight amen amen
[51:27] on Monday the Lord
[51:29] willing we going to have the bench
[51:33] again and uh yeah I can see there are
[51:37] people who love
[51:39] it amen and this
[51:41] time by God's grace the Lord
[51:44] will it will be with brother
[51:47] ephra and so so that we can hear more
[51:53] testimonies what God is doing with him
[51:55] in Ethiopia
[52:00] many other things that will be an
[52:02] inspiration to our
[52:06] generation So speaking of a Time the
[52:09] short time that the devil
[52:13] has the battle that we are fighting here
[52:16] on
[52:17] Earth see usually in a time like this I
[52:20] would want to I know according to our
[52:23] time I have about 30 minutes to speak to
[52:25] you
[52:28] but I know I will go a little more than
[52:32] that but for the things I want to
[52:35] speak I want to speak from my heart to
[52:41] yours how are ready to receive
[52:44] from amen and brother Andrew still
[52:47] you're not supposed to be all the way
[52:49] the other side you know where
[52:53] your yeah you know where your place is
[52:56] someone could be
[52:59] lonely amen the devil has but a short
[53:04] time and and and so I was saying that
[53:07] the battle of the world that we are
[53:11] fighting the Battle of sin the war of
[53:17] sin uh the war of
[53:21] indifference the war of the cares of the
[53:24] world
[53:26] the Tres of this
[53:29] life it all did not start with
[53:32] us we were only a victim of
[53:37] circumstances and so I want you to smile
[53:39] this
[53:41] evening a victim of
[53:46] circumstances but we are people who have
[53:51] hope no one can be so
[53:54] bad that the grace of God cannot
[53:58] redeem because God is Not contending
[54:01] with
[54:03] you God is contending with
[54:07] Satan and you are a child of
[54:10] God but the
[54:12] devil his desire is to take you out from
[54:15] the hand of
[54:17] God but he cannot do
[54:19] that because we are for ordained of
[54:24] God to overcome the world
[54:28] praise the name of the Lord amen and So
[54:31] speaking about a time of the
[54:34] devil we see the Bible Begins by saying
[54:37] that there was war in
[54:40] heaven and we know that that's where
[54:43] everything
[54:44] started Michael and his angels fought
[54:47] against the
[54:48] [Music]
[54:50] dragon and the dragon F and his angels
[54:56] you see this is when Satan thought that
[54:59] he was
[55:02] good and he thought he could be able to
[55:04] take the place of
[55:06] God and he wanted to go and Ascend at
[55:10] the at the Throne of
[55:12] God but of course he he was
[55:16] shortsighted he did not know he knew
[55:19] that God had made
[55:21] him and he was
[55:24] deceived in himself
[55:27] to think that the power that he
[55:30] has was greater than the power that God
[55:33] has Satan is making the same mistake
[55:37] today you to think that the power of of
[55:41] God is lesser than his
[55:44] power you know what tell me what can the
[55:47] devil bring your
[55:49] way what can the devil bring my
[55:53] way that will be more than the power of
[55:55] God
[55:57] the power of God is greater than
[56:00] all the power of God is greater than
[56:04] sickness we know that all sickness is
[56:06] caused by the
[56:07] devil so the power of God is greater
[56:10] than the power of
[56:12] sickness it is greater than the power of
[56:14] sin it is greater than the power of of
[56:18] failure greater than any other
[56:23] power God is over and Beyond
[56:27] everything that the devil
[56:29] has you know he can stand there and tell
[56:32] the devil bring your
[56:36] best and even his best come defeat
[56:42] the when I when I think about
[56:45] that I get encouraged in my
[56:49] soul when I think about what the devil
[56:51] has done in my
[56:53] life from the day I was born
[56:57] the traps tried to lay for
[56:59] me you know imagine the traps is try to
[57:02] lay for
[57:04] you and he thought that one will surely
[57:07] kill that one will surely kill
[57:10] him every time he L
[57:14] that took you beyond
[57:17] that took you beyond
[57:20] that and even the Bible says when these
[57:23] bodies are failed
[57:26] even have another one
[57:28] Wai so in other words in this
[57:31] body and out of this
[57:34] body we are more than
[57:36] conquerors through Christ that gives us
[57:40] strength and so the devil the Bible says
[57:43] is the devil Satan the deceiver of the
[57:45] whole
[57:48] world so he was cast out into the
[57:52] Earth and so when the battle raged in
[57:55] heaven
[57:57] the devil now thought I am going okay
[58:00] now because I've been defeated up
[58:03] here let me go down on the earth I will
[58:07] defeat
[58:10] everything he thought he will defeat
[58:12] us but you know when he was cast
[58:15] down God gave him an allotment of
[58:21] time did you know that when Angels sin
[58:24] they cannot be forgiven
[58:28] but when a child of God
[58:31] sin they will always be
[58:34] forgiven but the devil and all
[58:38] Angels
[58:40] they they can never be forgiven I am so
[58:44] glad I am a child of
[58:46] God because I can be
[58:50] forgiven and the Bible tells
[58:52] me he is the accuser of the brethren
[58:58] and he was cast out of
[59:00] Heaven he came down to the
[59:02] Earth and he is the he is now here on
[59:06] Earth what does he
[59:08] do he the
[59:11] Tormentor imagine brother
[59:14] Solomon that Satan is the
[59:18] Tormentor do you know to
[59:22] torment the Bible says that you know
[59:24] he's the he's not only the
[59:31] accuser but he also to
[59:35] Mens a person who inflicts severe mental
[59:38] or physical suffering on
[59:45] someone and we see there are many people
[59:48] who are tormented here on
[59:51] Earth you remember the man who was in
[59:53] the toms
[59:56] of
[59:57] GAD he was being tormented by the
[1:00:00] devil his mental state was not
[1:00:04] good when he was in those
[1:00:07] storms the devil had made him lose his
[1:00:11] mind imagine a man a human being living
[1:00:15] among dead
[1:00:21] bodies and he was you know you know
[1:00:23] almost naked
[1:00:26] and um you know just sleeping there
[1:00:29] eating there
[1:00:31] doing which s man with the same mind can
[1:00:35] do
[1:00:37] that the devil was tormenting
[1:00:41] that and we see there are many people
[1:00:43] who are
[1:00:46] tormented and you know I usually take
[1:00:48] that
[1:00:49] scripture to actually say that people
[1:00:53] there are many people who alive
[1:00:56] we see that they are
[1:00:58] alive but they are
[1:01:00] tormented because these are the kind of
[1:01:03] people you find that in their mind
[1:01:05] they're not doing
[1:01:07] well even the place where they
[1:01:09] sleep when you reach there you can
[1:01:12] almost
[1:01:15] vomit that's a clear
[1:01:17] sign that someone is being to
[1:01:22] mened but anyone who is Washed by the
[1:01:24] blood of Jesus
[1:01:27] you know this the holy spirit is a clean
[1:01:32] Spirit he will take away all
[1:01:37] uncleanness you know if if you are
[1:01:40] sleeping in a place that looks like a
[1:01:42] like a a pig's
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:46] time when the Holy Spirit comes in your
[1:01:49] heart he will clean you up that you will
[1:01:53] even find it impossible for you to sleep
[1:01:56] in such a
[1:01:58] place you will find it impossible for
[1:02:00] you to live in a
[1:02:03] home you will find it impossible for you
[1:02:05] to come in
[1:02:08] church you will just find yourself
[1:02:10] coming even before the service to clean
[1:02:14] up because the holy spirit is a clean
[1:02:19] Spirit but people who are
[1:02:22] dir and
[1:02:23] unlean are people who are being
[1:02:25] tormented
[1:02:28] by and they don't even have an idea they
[1:02:30] being
[1:02:33] tormented you see these are people who
[1:02:36] you will find that they uh they take
[1:02:38] drugs for
[1:02:40] instance and you know it will control
[1:02:43] their
[1:02:44] mind where they will go what they will
[1:02:46] say what
[1:02:48] they in the mouth you find that they are
[1:02:51] V in their
[1:02:57] their words or their tongue doesn't have
[1:02:59] a
[1:03:01] filter you know he speaks a word bu
[1:03:05] and everybody
[1:03:08] get did you just actually say
[1:03:11] that you see this person saying those
[1:03:14] words is being tormented by
[1:03:17] demons and you know we are living in L
[1:03:20] the Bible says they don't even know
[1:03:21] they're being
[1:03:23] Ted so we are living in a
[1:03:26] generation that is full of human
[1:03:30] beings that are being tormented by
[1:03:33] Satan you know they're being afflicted
[1:03:35] by
[1:03:36] Satan praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:03:39] hallelujah amen what is an
[1:03:43] Affliction you know where you
[1:03:46] find that
[1:03:48] someone is in a state that they don't
[1:03:50] want to be
[1:03:52] in but they Bound by
[1:03:56] they Bound by it they seem not to have a
[1:04:01] power live above
[1:04:05] that you you'll find a person for
[1:04:07] example being afflicted by the demon of
[1:04:09] telling
[1:04:13] lies you see what is that they are under
[1:04:18] Affliction you find someone being
[1:04:20] afflicted by
[1:04:23] disease what is that the spirit of
[1:04:28] Affliction but do you
[1:04:30] know that you know the devil is the one
[1:04:33] that does all
[1:04:36] these he's the one who brings a bad
[1:04:41] situation many people by the way do you
[1:04:43] know that many people in our generation
[1:04:44] are being afflicted by the spirit of
[1:04:50] depression
[1:04:52] depression whereby someone has no joy
[1:04:57] did you

[1:05:17] you for someone to see a smile out of
[1:05:21] you they would rather beat you thousand
[1:05:24] Strokes
[1:05:27] because you do not have joy in your
[1:05:29] heart you are being afflicted by the
[1:05:32] spirit of
[1:05:35] sadness and you know someone says I'm
[1:05:38] unhappy I don't know I don't know about
[1:05:40] you but have you ever been around people

[1:05:51] are
[1:05:53] afflicted they don't have joy in their

[1:05:57] but do you know what happens when
[1:05:58] someone receives the Holy
[1:06:01] Spirit the first thing that comes to
[1:06:04] them spirit is
[1:06:06] joy and the Bible says the joy of the
[1:06:08] Lord is our
[1:06:11] strength that's why true genuine
[1:06:13] Believers are joyful
[1:06:17] people and these people who have who who

[1:06:47] prayer a Believer should constantly be
[1:06:49] in an atmosphere that brings
[1:06:53] Joy you know the world is inde
[1:06:57] that's why they go to find instant
[1:07:02] Joy why they find instant
[1:07:05] Joy is because they don't have joy in

[1:15:02] than the ones who don't believe
[1:15:06] him politics I don't even need to talk
[1:15:09] about
[1:15:11] it let me tell you the devil is the
[1:15:14] ruler did you know that today Satan is
[1:15:17] the ruler of this
[1:15:21] Eden that is why it seems us to be
[1:15:26] it's difficult for believers to live on
[1:15:32] Earth it's going to become more and more
[1:15:37] difficult sin will be lifted
[1:15:40] up and it will be accepted by
[1:15:44] everyone that it will be um it will be a
[1:15:49] shame for those who do not believe in
[1:15:51] sin
[1:15:56] and they will be
[1:15:58] outcast but let me tell you
[1:16:00] brother the devil who is castigating all
[1:16:03] these
[1:16:05] things he was cast down here on
[1:16:08] Earth and he's not going to be here
[1:16:12] permanently the devil is going to be
[1:16:14] here only for a special
[1:16:16] time don't let him amen BL your
[1:16:20] vision don't let all these demons all

[1:16:36] going to
[1:16:37] overcome but let me tell you brother and
[1:16:39] sister you have to be like
[1:16:42] men whereby you stand and say I am not
[1:16:45] going to bow

[1:16:50] defeat even when you are sick and you
[1:16:53] almost dying
[1:16:55] you will say I am not accept this
[1:16:58] sickness I am healed in Jesus
[1:17:01] name not because you already feeling
[1:17:05] the because you
[1:17:07] know sickness is not
[1:17:11] permanent but I you I we are
[1:17:17] permanent we are Eternal
[1:17:20] beings the Bible says when this body
[1:17:24] amen is
[1:17:26] dissolved when we die when we come out
[1:17:30] of this body there is another
[1:17:34] one to receive us hallelujah and that is
[1:17:38] an eternal
[1:17:40] body if you
[1:17:42] anybody every one of us has
[1:17:46] one we are just waiting to walk
[1:17:49] into just waiting to walk into
[1:17:52] you let me tell you brother
[1:17:56] amen this Bible is real and God is
[1:18:00] real just like we see sickness is
[1:18:05] real but sickness is not really
[1:18:09] real but the word of God and the
[1:18:11] promises of God are
[1:18:14] real praise God Amen after the
[1:18:19] Rapture the devil will be bound for a
[1:18:22] thousand years

[1:18:28] coming Saturn now I'm talking about for
[1:18:31] just a moment the time of
[1:18:34] Saturn he knows that that time is
[1:18:38] coming when he going to be bound for a
[1:18:40] thousand
[1:18:42] years and during the a thousand
[1:18:47] years that will be the Millennium of the
[1:18:52] bride and a Heavenly bridegroom
[1:18:57] and do you know the Bible says after the
[1:19:02] Millennium Satan will be losed for a
[1:19:15] space But even that time when the devil
[1:19:18] is

[1:19:24] from where he
[1:19:27] stopped he will immediately go and
[1:19:30] gather all the inhabitants of the
[1:19:34] earth and and and tempt
[1:19:37] them to go and attack the holy

[1:19:45] City who will be living in the ho
[1:19:49] City the bride and the
[1:19:52] groom we shall be in the holy

[1:26:24] prayers we are
[1:26:26] pray there is nothing we are doing in
[1:26:30] vain oh we are preparing
[1:26:34] ourselves for our homecoming
[1:26:38] time why the devil is preparing his
[1:26:42] own God is preparing his
[1:26:45] own don't worry about the ups and downs
[1:26:48] you have gone
[1:26:51] through is a battle
[1:26:54] and the battle is aen between God and
[1:26:58] Satan and our enemy
[1:27:01] Satan is a defeated
[1:27:04] enemy can say amen amen he's a defeated
[1:27:09] enemy doesn't have any power he doesn't
[1:27:13] have any Oh Glory to God control over
[1:27:16] us but now he's exercising a little
[1:27:22] authority because we are living in a
[1:27:25] fallen backslid domain that he
[1:27:31] controls and this house of
[1:27:35] Flesh which we are living in but I tell
[1:27:38] you brother sister we are
[1:27:41] dropped we are trapped in this
[1:27:45] body but every day we hear the word of
[1:27:49] God we hearing from our other body
[1:27:54] we are connecting with our other
[1:27:57] body our
[1:28:00] theop my God Amen we that's why we say
[1:28:06] Amen what what is that it's a
[1:28:11] connection our spiritual
[1:28:14] body and our
[1:28:16] soul but right now our soul is trapped
[1:28:22] here but one day
[1:28:25] These Bars of
[1:28:27] born are going to
[1:28:30] bust hallelujah amen and we are going to
[1:28:33] come
[1:28:35] out oh my we're going to come
[1:28:41] out and we shall go in our real
[1:28:44] body but while we are still in this
[1:28:47] one let us not give
[1:28:50] up let us Contin fighting
[1:28:54] let us continue

[1:29:10] Lord amen praise God
[1:29:14] amen amen and he says and he cast him
[1:29:16] into the bottomless pit and he shut him
[1:29:20] up and set a seal upon him
[1:29:24] and he should that he should deceive the
[1:29:27] Nations no
[1:29:29] more till the Thousand Years should be
[1:29:34] fulfill and after that he must be
[1:29:38] lose so that's the season I was talking
[1:29:41] about when the devil will be
[1:29:45] losed and that will be really ending at
[1:29:48] the close of the millennium
[1:29:54] yes when it is done then the devil will
[1:29:57] be
[1:29:59] loed and I saw
[1:30:01] Thrones and they that sat upon them and
[1:30:03] judgment was given unto them and I saw
[1:30:05] the souls of them that were beheaded for
[1:30:07] the witness of Jesus and for the word of
[1:30:09] God and which all right let us um go
[1:30:13] verse five but the rest of the Dead live
[1:30:14] not again until the thousand years we
[1:30:16] have finished this is the first
[1:30:18] resurrection now we talking about uh the
[1:30:22] the the
[1:30:24] those who came up in the in the in the
[1:30:26] first
[1:30:29] resurrection he's speaking of the those
[1:30:32] who who would go in the
[1:30:35] Rapture you know those came up in the
[1:30:38] the ones who went in the
[1:30:40] rapture we in the first
[1:30:43] resurrection and they that were in the
[1:30:45] in the first resurrection or will be in
[1:30:47] the first
[1:30:51] resurrection the second death
[1:30:54] listen please listen the second death
[1:30:58] will have no power over
[1:31:00] them now the second death is the
[1:31:02] destruction of
[1:31:06] souls but the first death is the death
[1:31:08] of our
[1:31:12] bodies so now the Bible says six blessed
[1:31:16] and holy is he that has part in the
[1:31:18] first resurrection
[1:31:25] yes yes blessed and
[1:31:32] holy on such the second death has no
[1:31:37] power but they shall be PR and of God
[1:31:40] and of
[1:31:44] Christ and shall reign with him a
[1:31:47] thousand
[1:31:50] years hallelujah amen and when the
[1:31:53] thousand years are
[1:31:56] expired Satan shall be
[1:32:00] led out of his
[1:32:02] prison and shall go out to deceive the
[1:32:07] Nations which were in the four quarters
[1:32:09] of the
[1:32:11] earth and the devil that deceived verse
[1:32:14] 10 now okay okay okay let us read verse
[1:32:16] n okay because of time and they went up
[1:32:18] on the breadth of the earth and
[1:32:20] compassed the camp of the Saints about
[1:32:21] now these are the people who were
[1:32:22] possessed now by the by Satan deceived
[1:32:24] by Satan and the Beloved City and and
[1:32:27] fire came down from God out of heaven
[1:32:29] and dived
[1:32:42] them and now
[1:32:46] listen amen I'm telling you know amen
[1:32:49] when the devil came down to amen deceive
[1:32:51] the other people to go and attack the
[1:32:52] city

[1:32:58] Earth amen he could not
[1:33:02] Prevail and the fire consumed all of
[1:33:05] them and the devil that deceived
[1:33:09] them oh be ready for this one now be
[1:33:12] ready for this one the devil that
[1:33:13] deceived
[1:33:15] them was cast into the lake of
[1:33:21] fire and brimstone
[1:33:24] where the Beast was was and where the
[1:33:27] false prophet
[1:33:31] was and they will be
[1:33:34] tormented they
[1:33:36] are
[1:33:40] forever amen somebody tell
[1:33:42] Satan your time is
[1:33:45] coming hallelujah amen come on tell your
[1:33:49] time is
[1:33:50] coming the day of sat is coming
[1:33:54] where he shall be cast to the Lake of
[1:33:57] Fire Oh Glory to God Amen and the Bible
[1:34:01] says Satan
[1:34:04] knows because he's being cast down on
[1:34:07] Earth but he has great
[1:34:10] rra because he
[1:34:13] knows
[1:34:16] he but a short
[1:34:19] time so he's he's very angry
[1:34:24] listen to me Church Satan is very
[1:34:28] angry because of one
[1:34:31] reason he knows he has but a short
[1:34:34] time so he's doing everything he
[1:34:37] can to finish all he
[1:34:41] can and that's why let me tell you
[1:34:44] brother us not
[1:34:46] rest because Satan is not
[1:34:50] resting let us not
[1:34:52] sleep because is not
[1:34:55] sleeping the more he comes to you the
[1:34:58] more you should go in prayer the more it
[1:35:00] comes in you the more you should amen go
[1:35:03] before
[1:35:05] God and hear his word let me tell you
[1:35:09] this is our time to ourselves in the
[1:35:14] word to ourselves in
[1:35:17] prayer because Satan
[1:35:19] knows he has a short time
[1:35:24] so he has to use every
[1:35:26] moment he has to use every every
[1:35:30] tactic let me tell you I am amen I'm
[1:35:34] putting sat on notice
[1:35:36] today I am some of you can join me
[1:35:40] tonight I am putting sat on
[1:35:43] not no matter what tactic he
[1:35:47] uses I am
[1:35:49] standing on a solid
[1:35:51] rock he cannot get
[1:35:55] he cannot get you as long as you are his
[1:36:00] beloved his eyes is on the
[1:36:05] sparrow and he's watching over
[1:36:09] us amen Satan
[1:36:11] knows he has but a short time he's doing
[1:36:17] everything he
[1:36:19] can to to
[1:36:21] steal to kill
[1:36:24] to
[1:36:28] Rob everything he come from
[1:36:33] us if he will rob our
[1:36:39] Zeal he will rob
[1:36:41] it whatever he can do he will
[1:36:44] do if if you rob our prayer
[1:36:49] life she will rob
[1:36:51] it if you will rob our fight
[1:36:56] he will rob it you will see many people
[1:36:58] going to
[1:37:00] church but very few
[1:37:03] Christians and the devil is
[1:37:06] happy but where is that Zeal and
[1:37:11] fire and
[1:37:13] sincerity now that doesn't mean that
[1:37:15] you're going to be
[1:37:17] perfect you know we have a wrong
[1:37:19] mentality and a wrong
[1:37:21] attitude when we come before God
[1:37:25] God
[1:37:25] knows that you are
[1:37:28] weak and that you
[1:37:31] insufficient he knows all
[1:37:34] that and that's why the other time I was
[1:37:36] preaching about
[1:37:39] sincerity so when you come before God
[1:37:42] don't go before him as some as a
[1:37:47] Christian oh God you know I'm saved
[1:37:51] sanctified
[1:37:55] I'm going to
[1:37:59] heaven what kind of pray is that come
[1:38:02] before him with
[1:38:04] sincerity with a broken
[1:38:07] heart he knows all your
[1:38:10] dirty he knows all your
[1:38:13] weakness but one thing I want to tell
[1:38:15] you
[1:38:16] tonight he's
[1:38:18] willing to strengthen you
[1:38:23] ify you to empower you to give you
[1:38:28] Grace but when you come before him in
[1:38:30] prayer approach him with that
[1:38:35] attitude amen come by the door of the
[1:38:40] blood accept your
[1:38:44] unworth accept your
[1:38:47] weakness you know I have
[1:38:52] noticed whenever I come before God
[1:38:55] without that
[1:38:57] attitude for a few
[1:38:59] moments I'm just you know like broken in
[1:39:02] his
[1:39:03] presence maybe for like 30 minutes and
[1:39:06] the whole time I'm praying
[1:39:09] broken
[1:39:11] crying but watch the next one hour and a
[1:39:14] half or
[1:39:18] two I'm praying
[1:39:24] like as if I'm on
[1:39:28] steroids as if I'm
[1:39:35] swimming what is
[1:39:37] that you've approached God a right
[1:39:42] way and his Spirit comes with
[1:39:45] you and then all of the
[1:39:47] sudden he makes you
[1:39:50] able he makes you able
[1:39:53] now go before
[1:39:56] Saturn with
[1:39:58] strength
[1:40:02] Authority why because then it's no
[1:40:07] longer your power no longer your
[1:40:10] author there not the power of the Holy
[1:40:14] Spirit do you know when you go to
[1:40:17] prayer through prayer should not be us
[1:40:21] praying it's not should not be us
[1:40:23] praying it should not be you
[1:40:26] praying it should be him
[1:40:30] praying him praying in
[1:40:32] us with his
[1:40:36] faith that is what serves
[1:40:39] us the faith of the Son of
[1:40:42] God and when he begins to pray in
[1:40:45] you sometimes you even find yourself
[1:40:47] making prophetic utterances
[1:40:53] over your
[1:40:55] life you begin praying declarations over
[1:40:59] your
[1:41:00] life and under that
[1:41:03] anointing you feel like there is no stop
[1:41:05] to

[1:43:34] You job
[1:43:37] 21 there was a day when the sons of of
[1:43:40] God came to present themselves before
[1:43:42] the
[1:43:45] Lord and sat came also among
[1:43:49] them to present himself before the
[1:43:52] Lord and the Lord said unto
[1:43:54] Satan from
[1:43:57] come and Satan answered
[1:44:01] the he said from going to
[1:44:07] and in the world in the earth and from
[1:44:11] walking up and
[1:44:16] down that's what the devil
[1:44:19] does the devil always does that
[1:44:23] is going
[1:44:25] everywhere this week he has checked my
[1:44:29] home he has checked your
[1:44:36] homeing
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:39] and is
[1:44:41] online he checked your home
[1:44:44] too brother did he check your
[1:44:48] home he checked your
[1:44:50] home your home angels
[1:44:56] but he's checking
[1:44:58] everywhere
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:09] going where can I
[1:45:13] do
[1:45:16] can by that side brother
[1:45:24] the brother said he
[1:45:27] did he came
[1:45:29] around sister Angela did he come around
[1:45:36] there That's what Satan
[1:45:41] told and
[1:45:43] so as you were walking
[1:45:46] around did you see
[1:45:51] my said
[1:45:53] that one I know him I've
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:00] alwaysed but the
[1:46:02] problem the reason why he's not cursing
[1:46:04] you and leaving you you have blessed
[1:46:10] him have given him everything he
[1:46:13] want how can he now C
[1:46:16] you now God said that's what you think
[1:46:21] because I blessed him
[1:46:23] okay go touch everything I've given
[1:46:27] him but don't dare touch his
[1:46:31] soul the devil never touched the soul of
[1:46:33] of
[1:46:34] job so even the devil obeys
[1:46:40] God the devil always obeys God by the
[1:46:43] way did you know that and do you know
[1:46:46] where God
[1:46:47] is God is in his word
[1:46:53] believer who believes the word God is in
[1:46:57] them if you have received the Holy Ghost
[1:47:01] God is in you that's why the Bible says
[1:47:04] you have power to bind you power to
[1:47:08] lose you can tell Satan to go here and
[1:47:11] he will you tell him to go here
[1:47:14] and you can touch the sick and the sick
[1:47:18] will cast out the spirit
[1:47:23] that
[1:47:24] Authority and the devil will always
[1:47:27] obey because he knows his time is only
[1:47:32] there before God comes
[1:47:34] down when God comes down his time has
[1:47:38] come to one
[1:47:40] end Oh Glory to God amen glory to God
[1:47:43] Amen and that is why we
[1:47:46] find because of time I not read the
[1:47:48] quote I have a long quote
[1:47:51] here in the message questions and
[1:47:55] answers but the M was talking about
[1:47:58] um excuse me he was talking about
[1:48:02] Satan how he went you know with Jesus up
[1:48:07] there and tried to tempt
[1:48:09] him he walked arounded to tempt
[1:48:13] him but
[1:48:17] listen oh I wish I had time I would read
[1:48:19] all this he was telling him
[1:48:23] all the
[1:48:24] kingdoms are given to me bow down
[1:48:29] worship me I give them over to
[1:48:31] you but Jesus did not because he knew
[1:48:35] all the
[1:48:36] kingdoms belong to
[1:48:39] him that's why we don't want need to
[1:48:41] worship
[1:48:42] Satan because all the
[1:48:44] kingdoms Belong To Us Praise the name of
[1:48:48] the Lord amen and we are given
[1:48:50] power to bind
[1:48:53] we are given power to
[1:48:56] lose and when Jesus was
[1:48:59] coming in Mathew
[1:49:03] 8:28 as was approaching that man who was
[1:49:06] possessed by
[1:49:09] demons listen the demon saw him
[1:49:13] coming
[1:49:15] they you have come to destroy us before
[1:49:20] our time
[1:49:23] they they know their
[1:49:25] time we have already talked about
[1:49:27] his he knows it he knows his time is
[1:49:32] coming but he knows
[1:49:35] also the same God who gave him that
[1:49:38] time can destroy him before his
[1:49:42] death but one thing about God he cannot
[1:49:46] break his own
[1:49:49] word so he can't destroy sat before he
[1:49:55] he can cast him out of a
[1:50:00] Believer and when those demons were cast
[1:50:02] out they went in the
[1:50:05] animals and
[1:50:08] drowned what Dr was not the
[1:50:12] spirits it was the
[1:50:16] animals where are those
[1:50:19] Spirits they are still on Earth today
[1:50:23] but we as
[1:50:24] Believers we are given the
[1:50:27] authority to cast them
[1:50:30] out and let me tell you if you're
[1:50:33] tormented by any Spirit prayer is the
[1:50:39] key
[1:50:41] key come together and
[1:50:43] pray Sometimes some Spirits need
[1:50:47] fasting you come together you fast and
[1:50:49] pray but God answers prayer
[1:50:53] praise the name of the Lord amen the
[1:50:55] devil's time is coming to an
[1:50:59] end do you know what would
[1:51:01] happen when the Seven Seals are
[1:51:05] open the Bible says there should be time
[1:51:07] no
[1:51:10] longer for
[1:51:15] who when we say we living in the end
[1:51:19] time the end of
[1:51:23] you end
[1:51:25] time I am
[1:51:27] Eternal I have no
[1:51:31] expired the end time of
[1:51:35] Satan and all the
[1:51:37] demons have been tormenting the children
[1:51:39] of
[1:51:41] God that's why I believe we Believers of
[1:51:43] the message are the
[1:51:46] answer the world that is
[1:51:49] dying and may God help us
[1:51:52] and give us the
[1:51:54] grace to maintain the
[1:51:56] standard and remain
[1:51:59] standing no matter what comes or
[1:52:03] goes we shall remain in our
[1:52:05] place knowing the devil has
[1:52:09] but he's trying his
[1:52:11] best but we are also in our post of
[1:52:15] Duty how do solders
[1:52:18] fight when one looks the other
[1:52:21] side one looks this side and another
[1:52:24] looks the other side and they fighting
[1:52:27] defending one
[1:52:31] another that's what we have to
[1:52:34] do amen musicians can come to protect
[1:52:36] one
[1:52:37] another and we do that through
[1:52:41] prayer amen praise God hallelujah shall
[1:52:45] we stand on our feet
[1:52:55] how many are ready to go before
[1:52:58] God In Prayer the Bible says the weapons
[1:53:03] of our
[1:53:05] Warfare are not
[1:53:06] caral but
[1:53:08] Mighty through God to pulling
[1:53:13] down of the
[1:53:16] strongholds casting down
[1:53:19] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:53:21] exal
[1:53:26] and bringing into captivity every
[1:53:29] thought Obedience of

[1:53:42] Disobedience when your obedience is
[1:53:47] fulfilled and in Ephesians
[1:53:49] 6 from verse 11 tells us to put on the

[1:54:04] supplication and watching there unto
