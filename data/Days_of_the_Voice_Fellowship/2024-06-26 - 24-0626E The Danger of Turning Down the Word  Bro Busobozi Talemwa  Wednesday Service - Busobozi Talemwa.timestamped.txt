[41:05] sound uh this evening we are also
[41:08] speaking to evening
[41:13] light we send our greetings to the
[41:15] Saints there as
[41:17] well I'd like us to turn to our Bibles
[41:20] God bless each of you your
[41:23] word Isaiah chapter 6
[41:31] we are reading from vers
[41:36] [Music]
[41:45] 8 Isaiah chter 6: 8 to 10
[42:13] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[42:16] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[42:18] for us then said I here am I send me
[42:35] he said go and tell these people hear ye
[42:39] indeed but understand not and ye and see
[42:44] ye indeed but perceive not make the he
[42:48] the heart of these people fat and make
[42:51] their ears heavy and shut their eyes
[42:55] lest they see with their eyes eyes and
[42:58] hear with their ears and understand with
[43:00] their heart and convert and be healed
[43:40] amen you may be
[43:47] seated so I'm going to speak to you
[43:49] today on the danger of turning down the
[43:52] word
[44:00] the danger of turning down the
[44:03] word so here in the book of
[44:08] Isaiah some of you have read here
[44:12] before this is the place where Isaiah
[44:16] heard from
[44:20] God in the year that King
[44:24] died and he said that in the year King
[44:26] died he saw the
[44:30] Lord he saw the Lord sitting upon a
[44:32] throne high and lifted
[44:37] up and his train filled the
[44:42] temple and then he goes ahead to
[44:44] describe how the The Throne
[44:48] was and um the Angels is
[44:52] so and
[44:54] so the voice Cries Out
[44:58] who shall I send and who will go for
[45:02] us but you see Isaiah could not accept
[45:05] he said I'm a man of unclean
[45:11] lips unclean
[45:14] tongue and um and he says my eyes have
[45:18] seen the king and the Lord of HS why is
[45:23] me and then one of the Sims flew unto
[45:27] him having a live call on his
[45:32] hand and they had taken it out of the
[45:35] altar with
[45:38] tongues and he laid it upon his
[45:42] mouth and and he said and he he laid it
[45:45] upon my mouth and said Lo this has
[45:48] touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
[45:51] taken away and th sin is PED
[45:59] and I heard the voice of the Lord saying
[46:00] then whom shall I
[46:04] send who will go for us so then he said
[46:08] here am I send
[46:11] me and then verse 9 he says and go and
[46:14] tell these
[46:17] people hear you indeed but understand
[46:21] not and see ye indeed but perceive
[46:25] no make the heart of these people fat
[46:28] and make their ears
[46:31] heavy and shut their
[46:34] eyes L they see with their eyes and hear
[46:37] with their
[46:41] ears and understand with their
[46:44] hearts and convert and be healed in
[46:46] other
[46:47] words if they could be able to hear with
[46:49] their
[46:51] ears if they could be able to see with
[46:53] their
[46:55] eyes and could be able to um their had
[47:00] to open up to the word of
[47:03] God they could
[47:05] convert and they could be healed many
[47:08] times I have said
[47:10] here that there is no one no matter how
[47:12] sinful they
[47:14] are can sit under the preaching of the
[47:20] word and not be changed no one I don't
[47:25] care how sinful they are
[47:27] or how sinful they
[47:29] feel if they sit under the preaching of
[47:32] the
[47:33] word there is power in the word to
[47:36] change a
[47:38] sin the word can change a liar from
[47:40] being a liar to being a truth a truth a
[47:43] truthful
[47:46] person the word can change a
[47:48] thief to a real
[47:51] Christian the word can change actually
[47:53] you know a
[47:55] drunker a smoker
[47:58] you know as an immoral person to someone
[48:01] that is really genuinely serving the
[48:04] lord but what makes some people sit
[48:08] under the word and they are not
[48:11] changed is because their ears are
[48:15] sealed their eyes are
[48:18] closed and they cannot understand with
[48:20] their
[48:21] heart so because of that they cannot be
[48:24] converted and they cannot be healed from
[48:26] death spiritual
[48:27] [Music]
[48:30] sicknesses and what causes that as we
[48:33] shall see it later here
[48:35] today turning down the word can cause
[48:38] someone's spiritual ears to be shut and
[48:40] someone's eyes to be
[48:48] closed we are privileged that we can be
[48:50] able to come sit down and hear the
[48:54] word it is a great great privilege
[48:58] but but don't do not misuse
[49:01] it well you have the opportunity to be
[49:03] in the presence of
[49:06] God hear
[49:08] everyone believe everyone open your
[49:11] heart to the word because if you do not
[49:14] do
[49:15] that you are you are
[49:18] risking to come to a place where you can
[49:21] never be
[49:25] converted you can never
[49:29] nevered out of your spiritual
[49:32] trouble and the prophet here says in the
[49:35] second
[49:36] SE and when a man turns down the gospel
[49:41] truth Satan Mar
[49:44] him
[49:46] where at his
[49:49] ear praise the name of the Lord you
[49:52] remember in the Old Testament when the
[49:55] Bible speaks of the
[49:57] um The Year of
[50:01] Jubilee that when when the sound of the
[50:04] trumpet went
[50:06] out everyone that was a
[50:08] slave the sound of the trumpet
[50:11] meant that they were free to
[50:14] go they were free to shout they were
[50:17] free to come out of their slavery they
[50:19] were free to go
[50:20] claim whatever belonged to
[50:23] them but if the sound if they had the
[50:27] sound of the
[50:29] trumpet and they refused to decline
[50:32] going
[50:34] out and they preferred their slave
[50:37] master rather than their
[50:41] freedom that slave would be that they
[50:43] said that the slave master would have to
[50:45] take
[50:47] them and put them on the door of the
[50:53] doorpost and or whatever and then and
[50:56] pin something in his
[50:59] ear like a tug on their
[51:03] ear and that would mean it was
[51:07] signifying that this man was going to be
[51:09] a slave or this woman a slave all their
[51:15] life why because the trumpet of the
[51:17] Gospel
[51:19] sounded trumpet of Freedom
[51:23] sounded but they never accepted the
[51:26] freedom
[51:29] when the trumpet of of Freedom
[51:33] sounds the trumpet of
[51:35] Jubilee and you turn down that
[51:39] Jubilee for
[51:41] slavery you never ever have that
[51:44] opportunity
[51:46] again it will be taken away from you
[51:50] forever now I fear there are so many
[51:53] people who actually go to churches
[51:57] but that opportunity they missed long
[52:01] time when Grace passed
[52:05] them when God visits others and yet them
[52:08] they never get
[52:11] changed I believe you to can
[52:14] testify there are people who can come to
[52:17] church year after year after
[52:20] year but nothing happens on their
[52:22] spiritual
[52:24] life it even be looks as if they go
[52:28] deeper in
[52:32] sin there is no change happening on the
[52:35] inside and of course if there is not
[52:37] change on the inside you cannot see
[52:39] change on the
[52:40] [Music]
[52:43] outside if if when you became saved you
[52:45] were a good
[52:48] liar and five years down the road you
[52:50] are still making a good
[52:53] liar it means you are not being
[52:58] changed if you are if you are a
[53:01] thief or if you an immoral
[53:04] person and you are not being
[53:06] changed years later it means something
[53:10] bad has
[53:12] happened the word actually the more you
[53:14] hear the
[53:15] word the more you
[53:18] sink you know the prophet spoke about
[53:21] the
[53:22] rain rainning actually the scripture
[53:24] would say rainning on the just and on
[53:26] the
[53:31] just and the word of God and when it
[53:35] rains it falls on the good and on the
[53:38] bad but you see the more it rains on
[53:41] them the more it manifests the character
[53:46] that they have inside of
[53:50] them take this example if there is a
[53:54] tear and there is a we
[53:57] the tear was not planted by the owner of
[53:59] the
[54:01] field but the wheat was planted by the
[54:03] owner of the
[54:05] field now when rain comes
[54:09] down rain does not disqualify the tears
[54:12] from the from from the from receiving
[54:14] the benefits of the
[54:18] rain the tears will receive the rain
[54:21] just as much as the wheat
[54:26] not say oh because the tears has
[54:28] received so much
[54:32] rain it means it is going to become good
[54:36] wheat it cannot become it remains te
[54:40] remains te wheat remains
[54:43] wheat so the outp powering of the Holy
[54:47] Spirit the preaching of the
[54:50] word actually does not there is a time a
[54:53] place you reach at
[54:56] there is something you can
[54:58] do that the preaching of the word and
[55:01] the outpouring of the Holy
[55:03] Ghost can literally make you worse
[55:06] instead of
[55:10] good and what am I talking about someone
[55:14] who hears the
[55:15] truth someone who hears the word someone
[55:19] who sees and experiences the outp
[55:21] powering of the Holy
[55:24] Ghost and turns it down
[55:28] and refuses it and rejects
[55:31] it that one their chance is
[55:34] gone they can never have the opportunity
[55:38] again their ears will be shut their eyes
[55:42] will be closed their hearts will never
[55:44] be
[55:45] received bam would go ahead to talk
[55:48] about
[55:49] Russia how that was an out powering
[55:52] there and they they rejected it and see
[55:56] they went into
[55:59] communism look at America same thing
[56:02] America rejected God when when God came
[56:05] down
[56:07] ATA and many other revivals even that
[56:09] during the the time of our
[56:12] Prophet did they reject did they accept
[56:14] the word they refused it and then the
[56:18] prophet says the Revival in America is
[56:23] over why because they rejected it
[56:27] why did God blind the
[56:30] Jews in Romans
[56:32] 11 it says there eyes are
[56:36] blinded they cannot see the
[56:39] truth what is the truth Jesus Christ is
[56:43] the truth he is the way he the life is
[56:46] the
[56:47] truth but they cannot actually be able
[56:50] to receive the Revelation that Jesus is
[56:51] the
[56:54] Messiah even today
[56:56] the Jews reject Jesus as the
[56:59] Messiah why because they rejected him
[57:02] the first
[57:03] time when they rejected
[57:06] him Their Eyes Were
[57:09] shut and now they cannot
[57:11] see even if you teach them their eyes
[57:15] are
[57:15] blinded and the Jew the Gentiles eyes is
[57:21] open while we still have an
[57:24] opportunity let us not play with what we
[57:27] have amen let us not turn down what we
[57:31] have when we hear the word let us
[57:34] receive with fullness of
[57:36] heart because time can come if you turn
[57:40] it down push it away that you will never
[57:44] have another
[57:46] [Music]
[57:47] opportunity that is the danger of
[57:49] turning down the
[57:52] word when a man turns down the gospel
[57:55] truth
[57:58] Satan Mars
[57:59] him he says where at his
[58:03] ear he defens him so he can't hear the
[58:06] truth no
[58:09] more and he's finished he stays with the
[58:13] group that he's
[58:16] with if he want hear the
[58:19] truth no you shall know the truth and
[58:22] the truth shall make you
[58:24] free the truth makes
[58:26] free how many believe that God Mar his
[58:31] God marks also his when they
[58:34] come God marks his by vindicating his
[58:37] promised word through
[58:41] them John
[58:44] 1412 and another thing if you want to
[58:46] put it down Mark
[58:48] 16 Jesus said these signs shall follow
[58:51] them that
[58:54] believe amen
[58:56] that's what God does when you believe
[58:59] the truth when you accept the truth then
[59:02] God comes down behind you to vindicate
[59:06] that
[59:07] truth that's why Believers of this
[59:09] message we don't we are not sign
[59:13] Seekers we are not Miracle
[59:16] Seekers
[59:18] because the the Miracles are supposed to
[59:20] follow
[59:21] us the blessings are supposed to follow
[59:25] us whatever you need in your
[59:27] life amen it may be a blessing it may be
[59:30] a miracle it may be healing it may be
[59:34] you know whatever it is it is supposed
[59:36] to follow you you know if you truly
[59:39] believe the
[59:41] word cannot Remain the way you
[59:44] are year after year after
[59:47] year it is impossible it is impossible
[59:51] to be a believer of the
[59:53] truth and your life remain blessed and
[59:59] changed it is impossible if your life is
[1:00:02] the same
[1:00:04] literally it means that there's a level
[1:00:07] you need to attain of
[1:00:10] Fai it is impossible for a Believer to
[1:00:14] remain the same once there was a
[1:00:17] man called Abraham he was a Buren man
[1:00:21] his wife was called
[1:00:23] Sarai she was bur to and together for a
[1:00:26] space of
[1:00:28] time but when the word came down and the
[1:00:31] word met them and they received the word
[1:00:34] amen the bar became
[1:00:37] fruitful and that's the same
[1:00:39] principle when God comes your way and
[1:00:43] you accept the word you cannot remain
[1:00:46] the same the word of Truth gives you
[1:00:49] Freedom the word of Truth gives hope the
[1:00:53] word of Truth amen gives free if you are
[1:00:57] bound the word of the word of Truth
[1:01:00] makes you overcome
[1:01:03] sinen praise the name of the Lord First
[1:01:06] Timothy
[1:01:08] 2:3 he says for this is good and
[1:01:11] acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:01:15] savior who will have all men to be
[1:01:20] saved and come unto the knowledge of the
[1:01:24] truth so God wants everyone to be
[1:01:27] saved that is why Jesus died on the
[1:01:31] cross the truth was powered out to
[1:01:35] us what is the truth Jesus is the truth
[1:01:40] what is the truth the word is the truth
[1:01:42] the message of the
[1:01:44] hour is the truth and the truth was
[1:01:47] powered out to
[1:01:49] us he wants everyone to come to the
[1:01:51] knowledge of this
[1:01:54] truth but will they come to the
[1:01:56] knowledge of the
[1:01:57] truth many have actually rejected this
[1:02:01] truth you know you talk about baptism in
[1:02:04] the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:02:06] Christ many have rejected you talk about
[1:02:09] one God many have rejected you talk
[1:02:13] about the
[1:02:14] Rapture many have rejected many are
[1:02:17] actually preparing to go through the
[1:02:21] tribulation you talk about receiving the
[1:02:23] Holy
[1:02:24] Ghost many have no time for
[1:02:27] that and when they turn it
[1:02:31] down when you turn it
[1:02:34] down you are in a
[1:02:37] danger of losing it
[1:02:40] forever that's why as a Believer you
[1:02:43] should never reject the word portion of
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:47] word even when you don't
[1:02:50] understand always say
[1:02:52] Amen say I receive it I believe
[1:02:56] it receive
[1:02:57] it and if you don't understand it he
[1:03:00] will reveal it to
[1:03:02] you but you should believe it Believers
[1:03:06] believe that's what we
[1:03:08] are second Timothy 3:1 I show you
[1:03:11] something
[1:03:12] here about people who will actually when
[1:03:14] they turn down the
[1:03:17] truth you know they they can never
[1:03:21] receive it
[1:03:22] again and the Bible speaks of them here
[1:03:25] in this
[1:03:27] portion he says this know
[1:03:30] also that in the last days perilous
[1:03:32] times shall
[1:03:35] come so men shall be lovers of their own
[1:03:39] selves cous bers
[1:03:43] proud disobedient to
[1:03:46] parents unth thanful
[1:03:49] Unholy without natural
[1:03:52] affection truth
[1:03:54] Breakers false
[1:03:57] accusers
[1:03:59] incontinent
[1:04:01] Fierce despisers of them that are
[1:04:04] good
[1:04:06] traitors are you hearing what people are
[1:04:08] going to be like in the last days are
[1:04:11] you hearing Church
[1:04:16] traitors highminded
[1:04:18] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:23] God you know that's why you can come to
[1:04:26] to church and you find 10% of the
[1:04:31] people even on Sunday
[1:04:34] morning instead of people coming to
[1:04:36] church they would rather stay at home
[1:04:39] and watch something something or go to a
[1:04:42] certain
[1:04:43] game pleases in the end time it is
[1:04:47] prophesied that in the end time people
[1:04:49] will love Pleasures more than they love
[1:04:52] God
[1:04:55] but yet these people are not entirely
[1:04:58] Sinners or titled or called
[1:05:02] Sinners they don't even call themselves
[1:05:06] unbelievers we are talking about
[1:05:08] Christians here
[1:05:11] soal we talking about
[1:05:14] Believers because the B says in verse
[1:05:16] five having a form of
[1:05:20] godliness but denying the power
[1:05:24] thereof now what is the the power of the
[1:05:27] Gospel the power of the of the
[1:05:32] Gospel is is the faith of
[1:05:35] it is the Holy Spirit and they deny it
[1:05:40] but they have a form of Godly but they
[1:05:43] deny the
[1:05:45] truth are you hearing me they will hear
[1:05:48] the the the
[1:05:49] preaching and they they will come to
[1:05:52] church they will say they Christians but
[1:05:55] they will deny the
[1:05:57] truth when the truth is being
[1:06:00] preached they will not open their hearts
[1:06:02] to
[1:06:03] receive their hearts are hard like a
[1:06:06] rock by the time you preach to them they
[1:06:09] have made up their mind on what they
[1:06:11] want to
[1:06:12] believe and they cannot open their
[1:06:15] hearts to be
[1:06:18] corrected the Bible says we have those
[1:06:20] people in the end
[1:06:22] time they will not say we are
[1:06:24] nonbelievers
[1:06:26] they will say we are believers but they
[1:06:29] will deny the
[1:06:30] truth and the Bible says from such turn
[1:06:35] away they will say we are
[1:06:38] believers but when you tell them a woman
[1:06:40] is not supposed to dress a
[1:06:43] thousand they say in our church we don't
[1:06:46] believe
[1:06:46] that what is it they don't have the love
[1:06:50] of the
[1:06:51] truth but they have Jesus on their
[1:06:54] mouth when you tell them immorality is
[1:06:57] wrong you will find men refusing to
[1:07:00] accept they will say they will ask you a
[1:07:02] question who can live in this world
[1:07:04] without being
[1:07:07] immoral you know they they don't have
[1:07:09] they cannot retain God in their
[1:07:13] knowledge they cannot open their
[1:07:16] hearts to the truth let me tell you you
[1:07:19] are blessed
[1:07:20] today if you can hear the word and
[1:07:23] receive the word and accept correction
[1:07:26] of the
[1:07:27] truth amen you come here because you are
[1:07:30] bad and you want to be
[1:07:32] good you come here because you a sinner
[1:07:34] and you want to be
[1:07:36] saved we come to God because we realize
[1:07:40] we need a change from the
[1:07:43] inside but the Bible says these people
[1:07:45] these
[1:07:47] men they turn they turn down the
[1:07:50] truth they deny the power of the
[1:07:54] word amen and so the Bible says from
[1:07:56] such we should turn
[1:07:58] away and that's why we are gathering
[1:08:01] here that's why we left our big
[1:08:04] monasteries that's why we left our big
[1:08:08] Cathedrals and we came together in a
[1:08:10] small
[1:08:11] place and the Bible says you are blessed
[1:08:13] you little FL you are
[1:08:16] blessed they can't understand why do you
[1:08:19] Fellowship in small small
[1:08:21] places why don't you all come in our big
[1:08:24] cathal
[1:08:26] amen because they deny the power of the
[1:08:30] word because they deny the power of
[1:08:33] God therefore he says from such we
[1:08:35] should turn away from
[1:08:37] them and we turned
[1:08:40] away for for of this sort are they which
[1:08:43] creep into
[1:08:47] houses and Lead captive City women Laden
[1:08:50] with sins LED away with diverse lust

[1:09:39] word then they will take you to
[1:09:41] Greek then they take you to Hebrew and
[1:09:44] then they'll try to show you that they
[1:09:45] understand the scriptures more than

[1:14:50] men as they as also
[1:14:54] was cannot proceed no further than
[1:14:59] their Hallelujah the Bible says their
[1:15:03] mind are
[1:15:05] corrupt they
[1:15:07] reprobate concerning the faith the Bible
[1:15:10] says they are like Janice and
[1:15:13] jamb how were they when Moses came down
[1:15:18] Moses was was having the mind of
[1:15:20] Christ Moses was having th of
[1:15:25] was having the truth in his hands and
[1:15:28] when he came down there came Janice
[1:15:31] there came and they threw down
[1:15:34] their their roads and their roads became
[1:15:38] also and the mouth of of
[1:15:40] Moses's the snake of
[1:15:43] Moses open his mouth and swallow the the
[1:15:48] snakes that came out of J and
[1:15:51] jamb but there is no
[1:15:53] scripture that says men
[1:15:56] repented there is no scripture that
[1:15:59] shows these men finally saw the
[1:16:02] truth they are
[1:16:04] reprobate concerning the
[1:16:07] truth they rejected Moses and by
[1:16:10] rejecting Moses amen their F was made
[1:16:16] manifest and they proceeded no
[1:16:20] father amen they could only stop where
[1:16:22] they were at
[1:16:25] stop with their
[1:16:26] fly let me tell you church we have a
[1:16:30] message that is Vindicated by
[1:16:33] God God came
[1:16:35] downen and showed himself he was with
[1:16:39] William
[1:16:40] Brother William bram's message is not
[1:16:44] against saying
[1:16:46] s he is not you know guessing that
[1:16:49] guessing
[1:16:52] this the message of William Bram was
[1:16:55] Vindicated by
[1:16:57] God th say the Lord amen it is
[1:17:00] Vindicated by the
[1:17:02] Bible he said if I preach anything and
[1:17:05] it is not in the Bible he said leave it
[1:17:08] alone that is a prophet of God because a
[1:17:12] true Prophet will not say anything that
[1:17:15] is against the prophets that came before
[1:17:20] him a true Prophet is not like Muhammad
[1:17:24] because Muhammad came 600 years
[1:17:27] later but things he teaches are not
[1:17:31] here therefore we don't follow that word
[1:17:34] we follow our Prophet who has that say
[1:17:37] the
[1:17:39] Worden this message is not some new
[1:17:42] teaching this message is not a new
[1:17:45] ideology this message is the original
[1:17:49] Faith the origal
[1:17:51] truth in which the men of old
[1:17:55] walked in but others like J and
[1:17:59] jamb they with
[1:18:02] Moses even today we have men who are
[1:18:06] withstanding this
[1:18:08] message but what happened to them they
[1:18:11] could proceed no
[1:18:13] further oh the word is not always
[1:18:16] preached to be
[1:18:19] believed sometimes it is for a
[1:18:22] witness let us keep preaching the word
[1:18:26] amen if they believe you preach if they
[1:18:29] refuse You Preach if they accept you
[1:18:32] preach they turn it down your
[1:18:34] pre that's why amen if we are called by
[1:18:38] God I Don't Preach because you are
[1:18:41] accepting I Don't Preach because you are
[1:18:44] few or because you are
[1:18:46] many I preach because I'm called to
[1:18:50] preach amen why because this word must
[1:18:54] be preached
[1:18:56] a
[1:18:58] witness amen whereby if you reject it
[1:19:01] Amen on that day The Voice this voice
[1:19:05] you are hearing
[1:19:06] tonight will be played back again in
[1:19:08] your
[1:19:10] ears amen don't think the word of God
[1:19:14] dies the voice of the word does not
[1:19:18] die it continues on
[1:19:20] ringing it continues on ringing amen if
[1:19:24] you believe
[1:19:25] you will meet it the other side but if
[1:19:27] you refuse it you will meet it the other
[1:19:30] side so a
[1:19:32] judgment if I am you brother
[1:19:35] sister let us believe the word when we
[1:19:37] hear
[1:19:39] it every part of the world because every
[1:19:43] part of the
[1:19:44] world is truth every part of the world
[1:19:48] to be
[1:19:49] believed every part of the word is to be
[1:19:53] eaten is to be
[1:19:55] when he gave the open book he said Take
[1:19:58] and
[1:20:00] Eat take and eat it will be in your
[1:20:03] mouth sweet as H it will be in your
[1:20:07] belly bitter what are we doing we are
[1:20:11] taking the word the open Word and we are
[1:20:15] eating it not some of it all of the
[1:20:20] world Believers believe all of the world
[1:20:25] even if your that word has not yet
[1:20:26] manifested in
[1:20:28] you you believe it and you will become
[1:20:32] the
[1:20:33] word amen amen the danger of turning
[1:20:37] down the
[1:20:38] word is that you will never get another
[1:20:42] opportunity and we find here I'll show
[1:20:45] you an
[1:20:46] example Matthew
[1:20:48] 5:20 for I say unto you that accept your
[1:20:52] righteousness
[1:20:55] you message
[1:20:56] Believers except your
[1:20:59] righteousness shall exceed the
[1:21:01] righteousness of the scribes and the
[1:21:06] Pharisees shall in no case enter into
[1:21:09] the kingdom
[1:21:11] of now the Pharisees had to fulfill the
[1:21:14] works of the
[1:21:16] Lord for example thou shal not
[1:21:20] kill now they had to fulfill the works
[1:21:25] but for us our
[1:21:28] righteousness has to go beyond the
[1:21:32] work now our
[1:21:34] righteousness is Christ requires
[1:21:38] us to have his
[1:21:44] righteousness in our
[1:21:47] hearts by
[1:21:50] faith in his
[1:21:53] word that is
[1:21:55] righte Hallelujah that is the only
[1:21:58] righteousness that exceeds the law amen
[1:22:01] glory to God
[1:22:10] hallelujah that is the only thing that
[1:22:12] exists the
[1:22:14] law because said I did not come to take
[1:22:16] away the
[1:22:18] law he came to fulfill the requirement
[1:22:21] of the
[1:22:23] law the requirement of the law was that
[1:22:26] they may be holy even as God is
[1:22:31] Holy but the Lord demanded you to do
[1:22:34] certain things certain
[1:22:38] way according to your
[1:22:40] ability and the phes did those things to
[1:22:44] the best of their
[1:22:46] knowledge but they failed many times
[1:22:50] they became Hypocrites in the process
[1:22:55] and Christ came down and proved it to
[1:22:58] them that they were
[1:23:00] Hypocrites he asked them if your camel
[1:23:03] falls into the
[1:23:05] ditch on Sabbath day don't you remove
[1:23:08] it and they all looked at one another
[1:23:11] because they all knew they did
[1:23:13] it they were
[1:23:15] Hypocrites amen because within our
[1:23:18] works our abilities we cannot be
[1:23:22] perfect and God knows that
[1:23:25] and that's why he say for us to be able
[1:23:27] to go to heaven our righteousness must
[1:23:30] exceed the righteous of the
[1:23:33] Lord amen what is it it is Christ amen
[1:23:37] requiring us to have his
[1:23:42] righteousness where in our
[1:23:47] hearts by
[1:23:49] Fai by belief of the
[1:23:52] truth the Bible says you
[1:23:55] Sanctified by belief of the
[1:23:58] truth amen by faith in the word in the
[1:24:02] truth thank God for the message we have
[1:24:05] something to
[1:24:07] believe when you believe the message you
[1:24:10] are Sanctified you become holy you are
[1:24:13] made holy and you receive his
[1:24:17] righteous hallah glory to God Amen this
[1:24:20] go well over and Beyond just the good
[1:24:22] works
[1:24:25] if you turn down that word in your
[1:24:28] heart your Works will be
[1:24:32] evil it will always be
[1:24:34] evil listen if you accept the word your
[1:24:38] Works will be
[1:24:40] holy but if you turn down the work your
[1:24:43] Works will always be
[1:24:46] evil so now when Christ came he gave us
[1:24:50] the
[1:24:52] insurance faith by Grace is an
[1:24:56] insurance to go into
[1:25:00] heaven we now know we cannot be
[1:25:04] denied because we have received it by
[1:25:07] faith through Grace it is the gift of
[1:25:12] God am and if we have it in our
[1:25:17] heart then we will not do
[1:25:20] evil so we don't need the law we are
[1:25:23] above the law
[1:25:25] we above the because we we are
[1:25:27] fulfilling his
[1:25:28] will we are Ho by
[1:25:34] default God 1 John
[1:25:37] 3:2 nor
[1:25:39] does who was of that Wicked one and slew
[1:25:43] his brother and where why did he kill
[1:25:46] him because his own Works were
[1:25:49] evil and his brothers
[1:25:52] righteous why because Abel was
[1:25:56] predestinated he was a seed of God from
[1:25:59] before the foundation of the world his
[1:26:02] works could not be evil because in his
[1:26:05] heart was the law of God
[1:26:08] bound are you hearing me who told him
[1:26:13] that give a lamb who told him shed blood
[1:26:18] was in his heart it was a
[1:26:21] revelation faith is a revelation of the
[1:26:23] will of God
[1:26:26] and this boy had how did he get it he
[1:26:30] had it by
[1:26:32] default it was in him the Bible says
[1:26:36] they that are born of God canot see why
[1:26:41] because the seed of
[1:26:42] God remains in
[1:26:45] them the seed of God was in
[1:26:48] AB was a SE of
[1:26:51] God because of that could not
[1:26:56] see AB had Fai meaning AB had a
[1:27:01] revelation his Papa and
[1:27:03] Mama did not eat
[1:27:06] apples it was a
[1:27:08] revelation he had a revelation it had
[1:27:11] something to do with the
[1:27:12] blood it was a revelation the Bride of
[1:27:15] Jesus Christ we have a revelation of who
[1:27:19] we are we have a revelation we are not
[1:27:22] here to be B Church do we are not here
[1:27:27] to join our denomination we are not here
[1:27:30] to have our Ed somewhere we are here
[1:27:33] Amen to practice and manifest The Life
[1:27:37] of Christ in us that at the end of the
[1:27:40] day we will be carried
[1:27:42] away to the Rapture that is why we are
[1:27:46] here it is by
[1:27:50] Revelation Hallelujah Matthew 13: 10
[1:27:55] and the disciples came and said unto
[1:27:57] him to Jesus why speakest thou unto them
[1:28:01] in
[1:28:02] Parables he answered and said unto them
[1:28:06] because it is given unto you to know the
[1:28:07] mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:28:10] heaven but to them it is not given for
[1:28:14] whoever
[1:28:15] has to him shall be
[1:28:17] given do you have
[1:28:20] something amen God will add
[1:28:22] more and he shall have more
[1:28:26] abundance if you have faith God is going
[1:28:29] to increase if you have faith God is
[1:28:32] going to give you what you need you see
[1:28:35] because you have he
[1:28:37] will my but whoever has not from him
[1:28:42] shall be taken away even that he
[1:28:45] has therefore speak I to them in
[1:28:49] Parables because they
[1:28:52] see they see not
[1:28:55] I want you to see something
[1:28:57] here and hearing they hear
[1:29:00] not neither do they
[1:29:03] understand you remember God told
[1:29:05] Isaiah in the scripture we read
[1:29:08] first whom shall I send and the man said
[1:29:12] here I send me Lord and he said speak
[1:29:15] unto these people they have eyes but
[1:29:18] they see not they have ears but they
[1:29:21] hear not why why now we know
[1:29:25] why now we know why in
[1:29:28] Matthew because the Bible is saying here
[1:29:32] verse 14 and in them is fulfilled the
[1:29:35] prophecy of
[1:29:36] [Music]
[1:29:38] Isaiah in who in the Pharisees and the
[1:29:43] SES the people who were
[1:29:46] Jews but what happened with when the
[1:29:49] Messiah came they saw him they never
[1:29:52] accepted him rejected him and when they
[1:29:55] rejected him the Bible says that
[1:29:59] prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled with
[1:30:04] them which Say by hearing he shall
[1:30:08] hear by hearing he shall hear and shall
[1:30:11] not understand and seeing he shall see
[1:30:14] and shall not perceive for these
[1:30:16] people's hearts is wased
[1:30:20] gross and their ears a of
[1:30:25] hearing and their eyes they have closed
[1:30:29] L at any time they should see with their
[1:30:32] eyes and hear with their ears and should
[1:30:36] understand with their heart and should
[1:30:38] be
[1:30:39] converted and I should heal them who
[1:30:44] Jesus Isaiah was speaking of
[1:30:48] Jesus when Jesus
[1:30:51] came Oh Glory to God when Jesus came and
[1:30:56] he started speaking to the phes
[1:30:58] and he never spoke to
[1:31:01] them in words they can understand he
[1:31:05] spoke to them in
[1:31:07] Parables and when he finished The
[1:31:09] Parables he would leave them he would
[1:31:12] again come another Parable and then he
[1:31:15] would leave them and one time one
[1:31:18] disciple asked but why do you speak in
[1:31:20] Parable
[1:31:22] today why do you speaking
[1:31:25] Parables and Jesus answered because they
[1:31:29] have eyes they can't see they have ears
[1:31:33] they can't hear it is them it is them it
[1:31:37] should be
[1:31:38] fulfilled what is prophesied why do I
[1:31:42] waste my
[1:31:43] time to
[1:31:45] explain what they can't understand but
[1:31:48] he looked to the disciples and he said
[1:31:51] back back blessed are your
[1:31:55] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[1:32:00] hear
[1:32:01] oh for I say unto you that many prophets
[1:32:06] and righteous men have desired to see
[1:32:08] those things which you
[1:32:10] see and I've have not seen them and to
[1:32:13] hear those things which you hear and
[1:32:14] have not heard them who was hearing the
[1:32:20] disciples the disciples Jesus knew
[1:32:24] they had ears to
[1:32:26] hear they had eyes to
[1:32:28] hear so he spent time
[1:32:32] interpreting what the pares
[1:32:37] meant Jesus won't spend
[1:32:40] time on someone he knows their D of
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:46] hearing they can't see the D of
[1:32:50] hearing doesn't was his time he doesn't
[1:32:54] have his precious
[1:32:56] time but we see in our
[1:33:00] generation once again once again you
[1:33:04] remember Jesus Christ is the same
[1:33:07] yesterday today and forever what he did
[1:33:10] then he does today today once again he
[1:33:15] has
[1:33:16] appeared he has appeared through Elijah
[1:33:20] the
[1:33:21] prophet he never wasted time
[1:33:25] with the Pentecostal
[1:33:27] babies never even when he went among
[1:33:29] their churches he preached to them
[1:33:33] ABCs and when he came to the Tabernacle
[1:33:38] where the Believers were he preached the
[1:33:40] Deep
[1:33:41] Mysteries he went into the seal
[1:33:44] Hallelujah he went to the serpent
[1:33:47] SE because God was
[1:33:50] explaining The Parables of the Bible
[1:33:54] to you the
[1:33:56] bride and I want to tell you today
[1:33:59] blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:34:03] blessed are your ears for they

[1:34:38] knew him until today they don't know
[1:34:41] that Jesus was
[1:34:44] God the world thinks he is the third
[1:34:48] person of the
[1:34:50] Trinity they are lost they don't know

[1:34:57] eyes but they can it is right in

[1:35:04] emuel which means God is with
[1:35:08] us not the second person not the third
[1:35:12] person not the first person but God
[1:35:16] himself they read it they sing it but
[1:35:20] they have eyes but they can't see

[1:39:31] are not guessing at this we are not
[1:39:34] trying we are here because we have a
[1:39:36] proven
[1:39:39] message my my time is up but allow me to
[1:39:42] read a portion here from thean church
[1:39:45] age when the church allowed herself to
[1:39:47] move away from the
[1:39:50] original like Adam and Eve dead set in
[1:39:55] there is no strength in
[1:39:57] her she be has become a monstrosity
[1:40:05] horrific me that the church moved toward
[1:40:08] form and
[1:40:11] ceremony and toward priesthood by
[1:40:14] organizing the ministers into a group
[1:40:17] that decided leadership apart from the
[1:40:20] Holy Ghost and his word
[1:40:28] it is not a group of ministers that
[1:40:31] sanction of
[1:40:34] preacher listen it is not a group of
[1:40:39] ministers that start a
[1:40:41] church it is not a church or a
[1:40:44] denomination that sends out a
[1:40:47] preacher what does it is
[1:40:50] called by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:53] that is
[1:40:55] Apostolic he sends that a
[1:40:57] preacher and a church is started and
[1:41:00] that church is not led by a
[1:41:02] denomination is not led by a man that
[1:41:06] church is led by two things the Holy
[1:41:09] Spirit and the
[1:41:12] word hallelujah that very moment death
[1:41:15] sits and entered and she started to get
[1:41:20] sick and as she got sick she changed to
[1:41:23] a powerless group of
[1:41:27] people whose only weapon was
[1:41:30] argument you find
[1:41:34] ministering I am
[1:41:37] this don't
[1:41:41] do this the
[1:41:43] trth oh we are delivered from that the
[1:41:46] message of the hour has delivered us
[1:41:48] from
[1:41:50] that she could produce nothing in the
[1:41:54] spirit for our hopes were built on
[1:41:56] program and not on faith in his
[1:42:02] word they sold
[1:42:06] program so they ripped
[1:42:09] program they sold
[1:42:12] perversion so they reaped perverted
[1:42:16] children you tamper with
[1:42:19] God and you reap exactly what you
[1:42:21] injected
[1:42:24] man ought to learn from that that from
[1:42:28] nature he has tampered with
[1:42:31] nature he has injected his own ideas
[1:42:34] into nature and rearranged the molecules
[1:42:41] Etc and now he is reaping a
[1:42:46] worldwind just look how they have braed
[1:42:48] the
[1:42:51] chicken it is so bread that it is a
[1:42:55] laying machine that lays itself
[1:43:00] out is not good for
[1:43:03] food and it's soft and poor
[1:43:06] eating they inject substances into the
[1:43:11] meat and we eat the meat we
[1:43:14] eat and because of that the human body
[1:43:18] is
[1:43:19] changing so that women are getting
[1:43:21] narrower in the hips
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:26] and broader of shoulder and men are
[1:43:29] getting just the
[1:43:33] opposite now if you fool with
[1:43:37] nature and get a mon and
[1:43:43] backfire what will happen if you change
[1:43:45] the truth into a
[1:43:49] lie the answer is you will breed
[1:43:54] Antichrist Godless
[1:43:57] system of religion that is so
[1:44:01] perverted it will not look like or
[1:44:04] produce what the original
[1:44:08] did the only answer that God has for a
[1:44:11] situation like
[1:44:13] that is the L of
[1:44:16] fire but I want to say thank God we
[1:44:18] don't have to go
[1:44:20] there because we believe the word
[1:44:23] we have not turned down the word we how
[1:44:26] many agree with the word we believe the
[1:44:29] word when we hear the word we say
[1:44:33] amenu the danger of turning the word
[1:44:36] turning down the word is you will be
[1:44:39] blinded
[1:44:41] forever your ears will be blocked
[1:44:44] forever and the answer is the lake of
[1:44:48] fire god
