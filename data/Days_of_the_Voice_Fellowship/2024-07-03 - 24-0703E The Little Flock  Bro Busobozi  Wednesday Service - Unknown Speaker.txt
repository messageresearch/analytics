ourself in his presence tonight hungering and thirsting after him do not let anything stand between you and him tonight [Music] sometimes we even come you know but the enemy when you come in the house

we ask His blessings upon the word [Music] father we are going to open the pages of your holy word you say to us in your word where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in the mid thank you for being here with us we now ask that you give us a good atmosphere and you will also help us to create a good atmosphere for you to come in our midst tonight Grant it Lord in Jesus name amen I'd like to greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus you know uh what brings down the presence of God in our midst is not how many we are he not even uh what we are talking about it's about our attitude we can create an atmosphere around us that can bring down the Holy Spirit to minister to you or your sister turn to your neighbor tell them welcome in the [Music] house amen I know they're trying to work on the place and uh sometimes when our Sanctuary is you know when you know for us in the message when we have a sanctuary what we call a church we always look it out to the rest of the people and leave it open only for prayer and the word and the Gathering and uh until now the owner of the hotel cannot understand that because the church which was in here before us was always keeping the doors wi and Ja so anyone can come in and go so he was telling us but why do you keep your said well it's a holy place for us and now being that everybody has been coming in and try to work on the place of course the atmosphere cannot remain as our original atmosphere so but when we walk in our prayer our worship it consecrates the place it's just like if you go in an arena out there to preach there it's very you struggle but when you come inside a church that's dedicated for the work of God the atmosphere is usually right but you see it is us the Believers that set the atmosphere if you come tired or touching or having things disturbing you and you do not let it go you won't be blessed actually even when God is ministering to you he just passes You by but I hope that you can let go of everything tonight and for the next 1 Hour 1 hour and a half you consecrate yourself to the preaching of the word how many are ready to do that toight thank you uh one of our deacons Brother Martin has been here yesterday and I understand you'll be here the rest of the week as they working on the place and I think also brother brother Ivan was he here today as well so um I would like to invite you to the [Music] scriptures um chapter 12 we are reading chapter 12 Luke chapter 12 [Music] we are reading from verses 29 to vers 35 and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubt of doubtful mind read for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom sell that ye have and give arm provide yourselves bugs which works not old a treasure in the heavens that fath not where no Thief approach neither moth corrup for where your treasure is there will your heart be [Music] also amen you may be seated this evening I'm speaking on uh on the subject uh the little flock the little flock thank you musicians the little flock if you can turn back again to vers 32 and see what it says fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom number four we get to our subject uh of this evening you notice that in the in the previous verses he spoke about a lot of things and he was asking us to consider them maybe we can be able to go through a few of them from vers 22 and he said unto his disciples therefore I say unto you you take no thought of for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body what you shall put on the life is more than meat and the body is more than rment consider the Ravens for they neither s nor reap which neither which neither have store house no burn and God feed them and how much more are ye better than the [Music] fs and which of you with taking thought can add to his sture one cubit you understand no matter what is going on in your personal life no amount of worry or thinking can actually add one cubit on your St so then he says if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the rest so if you cannot change your St by thinking how much more do you think that you can be able to accomplish the Rest by thinking by worrying there is nothing that you are going to change by worrying about situations there's nothing going to change and then he gave he gave us examples here he said consider the lies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of those if then God so cloth the grass which is to today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven can you imagine that the Bible says God dresses the grass some grass has red clothes other type of grass has red white yellow God is a god of variety and he ured that he he made even grass look beautiful in the way it dresses but he says this grass today it is in the field tomorrow it is cast into the oven or like you can say in sopa you know for you to go and eat it yet God took care to dress it so how much more will he clothe you oh ye of little faith and then it says seek not ye that ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of of doubtful [Music] mind God does not love doubters God loves people who are believers and he says for all these things do the nations of the world seek after what you will eat what you will drink what you you know this is what people think you know every human being every single day is thinking about what to eat what to drink what to clothe to put on where to sleep these are the things that are making people even not be in church on Wednesday evening this is the things that make people not serve God these are the things that actually make people not follow the way of Christianity these are the same things that make it feel like it is hard to be a Christian someone will ask you a question how do you want me to make ends me I'm in church two or three times a week sincerely do you have an answer to that question you almost have no answer to the question but what the Bible says do not have a doubtful mind all the people of the world or the Nations they seek after these things what they will eat what they will drink why they will sleep you know with what they will travel with what they will put on but for us the Bible says for us that you should know that your father knows that you have need of these things that is so comforting for me my father knows my father understands that I have need of these tell your neighbor my father knows that I have need of these things praise the name of the Lord so no matter what you need the father knows what you need therefore I am not going to stop worshiping here even because of these things very few people today worship Our Father and even so in spirit and in truth very few worship him that way but me I know my father knows what I need I am going to serve him I am going to worship him and I'm going to do it in spirit and in truth even if it means to stand alone hallelujah hallelujah excuse me for just a moment by the mar I know we have renovation e e e e e e is because we are more in number you would be wrong because in the whole world we have 8 billion and only a little over two mil two billion a Christian the rest are not you have over two 3.2 billion people you know either Buddhists or Muslims and you know other religions and you have another 2.4 more than 2.4 billion and there in many other you know categories of atheists what what what so there are more who are believers than Believers yeah there no no brother you have to I don't know is mathematics challenging you brother very much okay let me go a little bit slower here there are more who unbelievers than Believers in the world [Music] there are more nonbelievers in the world than Believers if you understand that say Amen now now let's look at the group called the Christians because even in the group called the Christians we have very many types of Christians not all professing Christians really are true Christians now did you actually know the biggest number of the group called Christians is the Roman cathol Catholics we have more than actually almost 1.5 [Music] billion Catholics in the whole world now remember we have a little over 2 can say 2.4 billion Christians in the world but more than half of it is Roman Catholics who are they of course we all know Roman Catholicism and what they believe and what they stand for I will tell you a few things about the faith of the Roman Catholics the Roman Catholics believe in praying to and through the dead but according to the Bible that is spiritualism and it is not taught here in the Bible only which doctors do that kind of thing and other people who believe in spiritualism that's why our Prophet said that Roman Catholicism is the highest spiritualism that there is right here where we live we have a shrine one of the biggest shrines in the whole world here in I don't know is said four pops have been here and you know whenever they come all these people they walk from all over the country and all over the region they come by tens of thousands and and they come here every once a year and and you know in this place some of you don't know the things that take place there it's not only the prayers where the Pres that go and you know no there are other things that happen you see because they believe that these people were killed there because of their religion and let me put this correct they didn't they were not killed because of Christ but they were killed because of their religion so now these are different from the matters the Bible speaks of in the Book of Revelation they are not matters of Christ matters of their religion all right and we can if you want the history you can of course go and study about the matters of Nam you know how they were killed and so they died because of their religion and so uh now Vatican I don't know is it called canonizing or canonized them and they made them saints so now they are Saints so now that is why people come from all over the world and they come at this Shrine it is called a shrine why because you see a shrine is a place where people go to pray through mediums or to pray to Media to pray to a person you know a holy Place actually I see the definition here says a place regarded as holy because of its associations with the divinity or a sacred person or a relic marked by a building or other construction and so here they believe these people killed there and they have erected statutes and they they they have different shrines and they have different pawns tops whatever where people go and and and and and take this water and they consider it to be holy water I think do they buy do they sell it no okay so it is considered to be holy water so people will come with J from as far as from all the way all across and they come and that water to to take it throughout the year another year they will come back again you see that is that is spiritualism they believe you know you can go to the toms and pray through somebody who die as long as they were a priest or somebody who is considered to be holy just giving you facts these are not lies it is facts and also they they you know have a woman who they believe that she's a holy woman um Mary they believe that she's a mother of God their God has a mother but our God the god of the Bible does not have a mother but their God has a mother and their mother is the most holy whereby they cannot actually dare approach God but they will have to approach God through the mother of and then they will ask the mother of God to pray for them on on their behalf and and so and this is the biggest Christian religion in the whole [Music] world the word Catholic means the universal church so Orthodox is very close to the same same teachings so you see that they believe that these are the truth but most most of them their major truth are not written or are not Vindicated by the Bible and you see also the Orthodox same thing over 300 million people and when you United with the Roman Catholics you have almost um uh something close to 1.7 billion and you have the the Anglican which is about 85 million from all over the world thean community and so you are left now with many other groups mostly Protestant Pentecostal groups are the minority but even among those minorities you find that they believe things which are not here you find that they believe in the Trinity just like their mother Church the Catholic Church you find that they they believe in women preachers things are against the scriptures and so you go on scaling scaling scaling scaling down down down down until you reach to a group called The Apostolic church now this is one of the very last groups to be formed since Thea Street Revival and to be a denomination and it's one of the biggest uh denominations really among the Pentecostal but even they I can say that they closest to the scriptures than all the other groups but when you if you you know and believe this message and you put the light the glasses of this message and you look at what they teach you realize that many of them also gone astray so what am I trying to say that he said that when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth those who are going in the Rapture are going to be the minority they going to be the Chosen Few they going to really be very few now I have a few things I want to read for you here in the message thean Church age he says all through the Dark Ages he's talking about the Catholic Church she has dominated for over 900 years she planted and destroyed she killed the Arts destroyed the Sciences sence produced nothing but death until the light of the truth was almost entirely gone and only the beest S silver of light remained the be life splint of light Remain the oil and the wine had almost ceased to flow but though she dominated all the world kingdoms and demanded all men to find their citizenship in her there was a little group who belong to God and their citizenship was in heaven and them she could not destroy God kept his little flock they could not be [Applause] destroyed this Church of Rome was as hien and wicked as Queen aaria who tried to destroy all the Royal seed and almost succeeded but God preserved one and of him there came more of the faithful so God preserved a little FL in that long dark night and of their truth there finally arose a Luther now I'm trying to show you something here that we have seven Church ages but in every age you know God was walking and preserving for himself a little flock I I want you to open your spiritual mind don't sleep spiritually I want you to understand we are not here to form another church or another denomination we are actually not following any man we are not members of any denomination we are supposed to actually be part of the little flock in these last days because in every age there has been a little flock that was left for example in the first age called Ephesus there was those few that held on to the word then come come comes man there was those few that held on to the word and in every age God was sending a messenger but now the ones who held on to the world we are not the majority they were the minority in every age you see there was that Minority now listen when we talk about the bride and say the bride we are not referring to our churches in the end time we are only a little piece of the Bride the bride has been Gathering since the very first church age and all the members of the Bride are sleeping now apart from us who are alive when Paul wrote first Thessalonians chapter four he said they they will rise first and we who are alive and remain shall be CAU up be Chang so Paul was also at that time believing that he will be alive but Paul is not alive to see the last age you and I are the ones who are alive to see the last age called Lord in this last age God does his final work Gathering his last flock FL amen and and we are the Omega bride but the first church age had the the uh the um Alpha Bri the beginning so now all of them who died in Christ when the trumpet of God sound they will all rise up we shall actually literally see them physically do you know that Jesus is coming back physically do you know we shall see him with our eyes the Bible says we don't know how we shall be but we know we shall be like him when he comes so we shall have the same body like amen we shall see him he will see us and we shall go and be with him in heaven so but the dead in Christ will be the very first one to rise up and then we which are alive and remain so we are also believing we are the ones going to be alive because we are in the last age and then we shall be changed and then we will meet with them and then together we meet Jesus Christ in so if you have any loved one that died before and he died believing you will see him first before you see Christ praise the name of the Lord so now he says in there was that little FL there has always the Church of Jesus has always been the little flock it has never been the mega church it will never be the mega church it will always be the little FL always will be the now does it mean that we should not have big churches yes of course we can have big churches but I can tell you this we can never have the biggest church Never As a matter of fact the number of unbelievers even in message churches is bigger in bigger churches our Prophet told us there are three kinds of believers in every Church including ours three kinds of Believers we have the real genuine believers who take God at his word whatever the word says they say Amen they believe it they do it they follow it they never debate with it as long as the word says it they say Amen to that word they follow that word their life changes every day it changes follow that word now those are the Believers do I have some tonight those are the Believers I believe I am one of them but we have another group those are the mega believers they will they will believe like the Believers but they don't really when they believe because they do things when you see them when you don't see them they do other things when when you see them they say God bless you when they go in in the corner they do something completely different and opposite they are hypocrites they are not genuine you can never know even when you hear son has done something that brother s you can even say no that one is a real brother but he was a me believer he was hiding himself within among the Believers but he was not genuine I hope we don't have any maybe today they have not come maybe they will come on Sunday but we have them in the church every Fellowship has them and we have another category Nel they will be in every Fellowship go and study it the problem you don't want to listen to the message brother bam has preached it three kinds of Believers go and listen to it that the nonbelievers those ones they will never agree with anything they can't hide their colors he's not living but he's always not agre with anything he can even tell you that one I don't agree with it may I have another opinion but is also in the fellowship that category will always be there even in the Church of Jesus they were there in in the Church of Moses they were there in the Church of brother bam they were there and even in our church today in every Fellowship they are there but I thank God that we have ears to hear eyes to see and heart to believe we are real Believers now the Believers are the ones I'm speaking of there will always be the little flock there will always be the minority the Bible would say in the Book of Matthew 73 enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wi is is the gate and Broad is the is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go in their R because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there be that find it may God help you to find that little way straight is the gate wide is the gate straight is the gate wide is the gate broad is the way that leads to the destruction which means the majority will always go the wrong route but the minority will always follow the right thing are you hearing me ask your neighbor are you hearing the true genuine Believers Never never do something because the majority do it you will never follow something because the majority are following they will set their own Trend there are people in this world that set Trends and others follow them are you following me social media people are there doing a lot of things and the more you keep watching it the more you want to follow what they doing but the true genuine believer will not follow social media but we will follow the word in everything about their life in any aspect of their life in every area of their life be it how to manage a home you know how to live your life how to behave at work I mean everything you will let the word of God saturate you in every area of your life you will be a believer in the church you be a believer out of church you'll be a believer at work you be a believer at school you'll be a believer in everything you are doing and amen you are not a Believer only here and out there you are something else we have people who have a spirit or the spirit of a dark on them you know how a dark behaves a duck will sure come in the rain and will allow the rain to rain down on it when you look at it you'll feel sorry for it see this dark it is completely wet but after it finishes to rain it just does like this it becomes dry the way it was before there are people who come in the church sometimes they even enjoy the word from today I'm changing as soon as they go out there peer pressure begins so and so comes and whatever they had they just shake it off it doesn't make sense anymore what happened what happened to them they never let the word of God come into their heart I am hoping that there is no one here with a spirit of a dark we hear the word we believe the word and we are allowing the word to change us brother sister my brother when you listen to the word open up your heart allow the word to come into your heart that it will cover that it will go deep go deep into your heart that it will change you that it will give you a new life some when they hear the word they they partition it in several other places you receive God in some part of your but in another area you refuse when I believed this message I was ready to give my all every part of me let it let the Holy Spirit by the word of God and you see you cannot receive the word when you are under the spirit of denomination in The Invisible Union of the Bride it says remember straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there and few but sorry and but few there will be that will find it don't go in that with that crowd that's moving on Yonder thatan Church age it could jump up and down it could dance under music didn't say it was ice cold it said it was lukewarm that's the Pentecostal and don't know that it's miserable they don't know it they're miserable they're wretched they're blind you find these kind of denominations you find young people like most of you and they go in the church and they call it praise you know how many have seen that praise young people like Sam they come up dress them in pajamas very tight Solomon IRAs and others no they don't pick the ones they pick the the Slender ones tell them come and they they they tighten themselves you can literally see every part of their body and then they someone comes there is is is not a praise leader and he's wearing this short sleeve you see they are physically fit they ready to praise God and they have this heart a man imagine men are wearing hearts in the church let me tell you those are not churches and that's not praise to our God don't be deceived don't be deceived that those are not churches is not praise to the God I know that's another Jesus but the Jesus we know canot accept such price and then this man begins you know with all the younger ladies same thing they Tien themselves and then now they stand in such a way and the whole crowd is waiting you don't see anyone dozing they all waiting to see yeah it's time for praise brother lifts up the praise the musicians they have all these dreadlocks now those would be the shames and others and they have the dreadlocks I'm imagining you brothers having dreadlocks and you're coming on the piano they can't even sit because they stand begin shaking and then they begin playing and people when this one is singing which songs do they sing brother yeah you know how do they sing it this yeah singing so the song is saying that my Miracle is here today and as they're doing they begin jumping they all in order in one form they throw their legs they thrown the light they thrown the they throw their hands they throw their stomach they they throw they shake their head all in the same direction and then we yeah we are praising God come on and your hands let us praise the Lord and they it is the highest deception that there is that is entertainment it is not worship it is not worship and let me tell you God has delivered us from such God has delivered us from such he say they they did not say they were ice cold the Bible says they were lukewarm he say they Pentecostal they don't know that they're miserable red and blind but the question is blind to what they are blind to the word to the manifestation of the word praise the name of the Lord because it never come through their organizations listen the word of God cannot come through an organiz the word of God Amen comes through the message of the hour they cannot receive it Matthew 10 ver 29 it says and not two Sparrow sold for a fa thing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father 109 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered he says fear ye not there ye are more of value than many sparrows praise the name of the Lord when we talk about the L flock church it's a church that is very valuable is a church that is very special to God well there is another one which is not a little flock church but this one I'm talking about is a little flock Church it has always been the minority they have always held the minority views this Bible has always been believed on by the minority many claim to believe it but very really believe it but the church that is going in the Rapture is a little flock church and I believe I'm one of them praise the name of the Lord and and before you finish I'll read a certain long long quote really and so listen it says the hour is come and I titled it he said the how is come make your stand listen the time came for sadra M and to show their colors their faith in God did you know the time comes for each and every one of us to show their true colors to show their faith in God lack of faith in s m their time had come to show their true colors are they real Believers are they nonbelievers are they make Believers so they turned their back to the image they said our God is able to Deliver Us from this Fey fness but nevertheless will not bow down to any other images any of images there it was it was time the season was there so then the time came that when he was going to throw them into the Fey f to burn that religion out of them that's what the devil is trying to do even in our generation to burn our religion out of us but let me tell you what we have received the devil cannot burn it out of us because what we have received is more than Creeds what we have receiv you may say well you are few you are few even all over the world you are few I will even write out I tell you here recently actually the pastor that was a pastor of the biggest church in the message died recently he called brother baruti from Congo you know he had I don't not know the number but really tens of thousands and you find very few churches like those and I've found one maybe in Nigeria also and a few also others in I don't know Zimbabwe maybe I don't know whether maybe some some thousands well but all over the world you will find the message belie believing churches will be the minority we are not known we don't seek to be known also because our goal is not our goal is not to possess here in the world to possess places to possess you know spes when you go over in the Pentecostal world that is their goal to possess spes one who has the biggest TV show who has the biggest listen listenership who has the biggest following who has the biggest church and you know they feel they have big accomplishments when they have a 20,000 SE and so you see p will start today and in the next five years they have a thousand people it's very easy just tell them what they need to hear don't judge them don't tell don't talk against what they doing you know try to twist and tune the word in such a way that it will make them feel comfortable that even a sinner will come in the church and he will feel that this is surely my church when I went to church I felt so good I never felt judged I felt so comfortable and so this will be my church and another will come another come another come but you see this message is different why because our purpose is not to occupy space the purpose of this message is not even to start another denomination it is not to seek recognition you know and by the way it's not only us it is even those who were here before us all the other believers in the generations before us they did not seek recognition they did not seek space they did not seek you know big you know attendance but they had one one one thing in common they were all having a passion in them they were having a Passion Of Truth they were having a Passion of afterlife they were having a Passion of seeking God and finding God and being changed and overcoming the world you know they would read scriptures like we are the salt of the earth we are the light of the world they did not come here to make people comfortable in the world but whatever they preached was to make people feel uncomfortable in the world so that they can seek for another country whose Builder and maker is God and I believe that to every um one who claims to believe really that how comes that comes when you have to show your true color now you know that how never comes until you have opposition until you face problems in your life until you faced with with difficulties are you are you following me now and we look at Several of them here now that's what the devil tries to do all the time is to bur you on some to burn you up on something to make you Seeker when you are prayed for to make you think you've lost your experience with God but he's lying to you the time comes when you have to stand on God's word and and here is what I love most he said stand alone many times when I go on on on missionary Journeys preach to a a group of people maybe five or 10 people and you are introducing the message to them uh they would see everything is the truth but I've noticed and I give some of you who like evangelism a tactic on how to introduce the message to a new person you don't U meet a group because whenever you meet a group it's very hard to find one why people always are fear fearful to stand alone they want to stand as a group and so usually what I do I sit with when I I sit with a group talk with them and then I will Design who has the love of God in their heart and then appoint them at later dat and then we meet I meet with them show them the scriptures show then they will make their stand where they believe and many have believed that way see we were in what's the name of the place Brother Martin uh the north yeah L we were in L and you know we visiting a family from nor way you know took us to our family and preached there several people Tred from many places now after they received the word very well but when it came to now the time of decision that's where you you had to see now people looking down and they looking at one another are you accepting and a few very few a little group accepted and I'm preaching on the little flock the the little flock will always stand alone the time comes when you have to stand on God's word stand alone but when that time comes stand there stand alone stand there there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith and he says that's the time tonight praise the name of the Lord no matter what you feel regardless of your feelings that time comes where you have to separate yourself from your feelings and your faith the time comes that when this Hebrew children had to seal their testimony by a fey furnace I can see them that morning let's look immediately I can see them that morning they would come a great time in Babylon the king said now look we've got some Fanatics down here and they causing us a little trouble with their religion Hallelujah amen amen glory to God I like to be called a fanatic I'd rather be called a fanatic for Jesus rather be called a fanatical believer and I would rather be hated by the world for what I stand for for what I believe amen they were called Fanatics amen they were called outcasts and they say they were bringing trouble with their religion where it comes to a place where it comes to a place and you are among a people and those people don't actually have a problem with you the things they do you do the things they love you love there's a problem with your religion your religion is not salty you're not attracting people to what you believe but you are attracting people actually people are actually really influencing you over to their side I hope that each of us can have a a true religion where it will cause trouble in your [Music] vicinity I remember when I I used to be in school I was called all sorts of things because I never I never Shi away when it came to the word I always held the word of God with high regard matter of fact I've told young people how to overcome in school and this is what I did you see time comes this is for the young people that you would see you know someone that you attracted to I don't know whether they understand understand that yes brother a girl or some these days girls actually see better than boys a boy sister when I came in those moments my weak moments by this is what I would do I would call them and I tell them have something I want to share with and I would and I would open of course I would be nervous but I would open the scriptures and begin teaching on godhead women preachers the Rapture Holiness you know and all these things and by the time I'm done and I would even talk about because of course if I was talking to a god I've talked about trousers Holiness you know and I've talked about also um you know many of the things we believe in now she's a woman many times she would they would reject it and reject it with passion and whenever they did that I would reject their character with passion that way there is no way I could fall for someone I rejected with passion and if they would believe well then I would be their pastor and how can I as their Pastor be found in a scenario that is not good so then I went through school without one episode of living immoral why not because I was you know you know super powerful but because I was ready to stand for the word in every moment I got and so Brethren if you stand for the word some of you you have friends they don't actually even know what you believe shame on you how can you have a friend that you spend one two three four days with and they don't know what you believe they don't know your stand they don't even know about the Rapture those are the same friends that you will be with in the tribulation and you will know what is going on and they won't and you'll be the one to tell them actually I know what is happening and he will tell them they will tell you what is happening so we are actually in the tribulation let me tell you what is coming next and they'll begin calling you a prophet but you'll be a prophet of Doom and they will judge you they say why did you not tell us said but you know you will have nothing to say but now you have an opportunity if you're truly convinced about this truth number one you are not going to be afraid to Stand Alone number two you're not going to be ashamed of telling your friends about the word whether they call you a fanatic or not whether they call you a foolish or not you will be ready to testify to your friends and your peers and your coworkers about this message and so could you imagine burning the holy ghost out of a man it cannot be done notice I can see the king set out himself upon a throne they bound these Hebrew children they put them in the front of a spear and started walking up a platform that they were to fall into this great furnace I can hear s message sure you prayed through you know sometimes when Satan puts the heat on we have to stop and check up so they they said Lord do I truly believe you I can hear s say yes I've prayed up now the God said you want to take that back boy you want to take back that boy no we are willing to seal Our Testimony with our own life we are ready now we are ready now I wonder how many are ready now to seal their own testimony with their own life by the way let me tell you if this Bible cannot produce radicals it is not worth preaching we should have people who are really radical Believers of the Bible ready even to die we have seen Muslims who are ready to die and even to kill others because of their religion I met a brother young man who a somal some years ago who you know he was living in Somalia then lived this message and then you know they started hunting him down because you see these people are radicals the radical Muslims the more if you are part of their religion and you leave they hunt you down and they kill you and whoever does that is respected highly among so this brother was in Nairobi I think at a fourth or fifth floor and this man came you know they they they they know how to track they tracked him down and and and you know they came and pushed him over and you know he fell from the fourth floor came you know and then fell down right on the floor on the ground but you know what God kept him not even a born now you tell me that Jesus Christ is not the same yesterday to for and I met that man with his family and was so happy about this message saying oh I'm ready and willing and I'm ready to die I know any time they may find but I'm ready and I am willing to die we will not kill anybody but we should be ready to give our own life if that is what it took for the word of God praise the name of the Lord all the disciples did just that now sometimes when sat puts heat on okay okay now say now we're willing to seal Our Testimony with our own life I can hear Nebuchadnezzar say now if you will bow down to the image I will take it back no we've taken our our way with the Lord is despised few I'm going through with it the time was for decisions just a few minutes left many of you are sitting here tonight in that same condition had trouble Bound in these chairs and on these crouches and things to you it may be something else just a few minutes left in this meeting he says make your decisions the time has come for you to do it either you've got to believe what I've said to be the truth oh what God has WR his Bible walk away in the same condition but the time has come now let me tell you recently I preached on a subject and I really recommend it to every believer to go and listen to it those who follow our ministry here the danger of turning down the word time comes where you have to either believe the truth follow what the Bible says walk away in the same condition that time comes for every human and I told you that this word has power to change anyone it has power to change anyone no matter how bad they are it has power to do that I've seen it change me my life but whenever you are presented with the truth and you turn it down that moment you turned it down your ears are sealed your eyes are sealed your eyes are sealed your ears are sealed you can no longer be red you become unredeemable you walk away the same in the same condition and I can hear him say all right walk them up the heat begin to get a little bad don't worry if you accept him tonight as your healer Satan will put the heat on you tomorrow don't you worry about that they started walking a little further I can hear him say are you sure you have prayed up y all right got right up the steps to about one step they begin to feel fainty like they was going in in a few minutes I can see these Gods with their Spears ready to push them over into the f that was heat seven times hotter than it ever was his head just listen to these words notice we are painting an awful dark picture down here but let's turn our camera up this way once oh my always when there is anything wrong going on down here there is something going on up there there is always two sides to eat when Saturn is on the job Jesus is also who you yield your faith to that's the way it's going give your faith to Christ let's look up this way you know I can see him sitting up there in his majesty his Priestly robes dropped around him looking down I see him coming to his uh right a great angel I see I see to his right coming a great Angel his name is Gabriel great archangel he comes running up he pulls his sword he said master master have you looked down in Babylon your people is taking a stand for you down there the hour has come for them to stand and they are taking a stand how many are taking a stand tonight but the bunch of the of the people there but that bunch of people there is going to push them into that FY and Gabriel said let me go down there I will clean that thing up many times we do not realize how many host of angels are willing and ready to come to our rescue whenever we are in trouble whenever you take a stand I stand for the word I stand for Christ I Stand For righteousness I stand for Holiness whenever you take that stand all Heaven is on your side all Heaven is behind you but why do you feel alone sometimes because God doesn't want to send Angels just he wants to come himself he wants to show his glory he wants to manifest his majesty Hallelujah and and Gabriel said let me go and clean the thing up I believe you could have done it yes sir he said he will give his angels charge over this and I believe the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Hallelujah hallelujah praise God we have a song that says the storms re dark they won't worry me I'm shelter within the arms of God he walks with me listen and not of Earth shall me I am sh The Arms Of God he always fights for the weak he always fights for the Fain he always fights for those who have no strength because he's their strength and in this case the little flock has always had a host of angels around them to protect them to watch over them to keep God for them praise the name of the Lord and so I can hear Gabriel say I'll I'll go down there I'll strike Babylon off the map if you let me go down there have you considered them I can hear the master say yes Gabriel you are a wonderful Angel you've obeyed me and youve set that my right hand the day I created you but I can't let you go just can't let you go then I see coming this way another Angel you know God has got angels in heaven at his command I can see another one coming up look at him he rushes up he's called Warwood he falls down he has controls of all the waters I can hear him saying Master down in Babylon your children has taken a stand and they are going to throw them in the FY Fest this morning they almost there and have stood by your sight since you cre me I have the controls of the water in the anian destruction I broke up the Springs of the deep I swept over the Earth and I destroy the whole world with water let me go down there this morning and I will wash her off the face of the earth I believe you could have done it don't you right I can hear him say I can't let you go you've been a good angel but I can't let you go have you considered them yes all night long I've been watching all day long God has been watching over hallu oh praise the name of the Lord Brother his eyes is on The Spar I know he watches me he he's watching you he's watching how much Faith you got how much you got how much you got he wants to see what kind of a stand that you will take that how has come now what are you going to do he said I've wased them all night long I had every prayer they prayed you angels has been good Angels but I can't let you go I am going myself amenu I can see him rise from his SE the Priestly robes drop around him I can him hear him say come here come here East Wind come here West Wind North Wind South Wind come here you know everything obeys him I can hear him saying get over here that big white Thunder beard thunder thunder head out Y where it's at I can hear him roll up to his throne step over on there oh my reach up and get a hold over zigzag lightning pass by the tree of life and pick of a palm a palm pray what's the matter I'm going to Babylon this morning who the ancient of the king of Glory Hallelujah I'm going to babon this morning my children has taken a St I am taking a stand too whenever you take a stand amen God takes a stand for you brother take a stand for the word sister stand with the word if you a Believer whatever the word says you say amen I believe it don't worry God will amen take a stand also and when God takes a stand when you in a squeezed up moment when things are going sideways God Will Take A Stand and his stand will be to stand by you to Stand By Your Side Hallelujah that's why amen David under the anointing amen he was able to say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not fear Hallelujah I shall not want the Lord is my shepherd amen why would he say that he knew God was going to take a stand even though I walk through the valley of the Shad of death I shall fear no evil for thou with me how could he know that David was a prophet he knew when he takes a stand for God stand with him Hallelujah God stands with a little flock amen my my my about that time S and M and went down into the FY furnace taking their faith their final stand for the Lord and about the time they got into the fire there was a fourth person like the Son of God standing there fing away the breeze down there my his eyes and the SP if he would come all the way from glory to Babylon for three children how much more will he come to to tonight for all of those who are sitting here bound there has the hour has come father the hour has come the hour has come for you you are going to make a decision now let me tell you whenever you take your stand for him it takes a stand for you throughout history God has always taken a stand with a little flock and I believe God is taking a a stand for us let us stand on our feet tonight with every eye closed how many here have not yet taken a stand and you know what you have to do but you've just not been able to make the decision yet but you're risking you're risking your life what would you give in exchange for your soul if today God should call it away what would you give what would
