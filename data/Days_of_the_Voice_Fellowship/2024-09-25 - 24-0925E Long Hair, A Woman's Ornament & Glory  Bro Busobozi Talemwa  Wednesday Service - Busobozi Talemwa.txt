and then we shall go to the SCP father we would like to ask your blessings upon your word tonight quite a subject that I would like to undertake today that many have had questions on they've wanted to know where we stand on this what we lord I pray that you bless each one give me and Lord May the words come forth in such a way that your holy spirit will lead us answer questions take away confusion and and bring Clarity we will all know what we expected [Music] of and that is good and acceptable we ask your blessings upon the scripture as we read it tonight that it will be a blessing in Jesus name amen amen amen turn to your neighbor tell them you welcome in the house of the Lord amen amen is the Lord good has the Lord been good the subject I want to deal with today I'm happy to see several mothers who have sacrificed to be here know whenever it rains some of the people that cannot make it mothers so but when we see them coming with children I know a and certainly God will bless you for all those of you who have made it God bless you and now there are those who shall join us by the way of the internet especially those who are far but the subject I want to deal with today I have been asked by several by many on several occasions for the past one year regarding hair long hair of women and how should it be kept and so today by God's I want to deal with that so I'm requesting that you give me your undivided attention I would normally preach such a lengthy subject on Sunday so um being that's a little bit doctrinal so uh where most people are here but thank God for the internet that we stream and these services are recorded so someone who is not here can watch it later amen amen and so um also uh there are several in carja that have asked me to to also deal with this subject uh it's quite a an issue there I understand even there are some who have either dis fellowed been dis fellowed because of this issue so it might be so simple for you if you already know just uh just enjoy the word and if you don't know learn and if you knew a little you can add your understand but it is good for us to know what we believe is that amen and really what we believe is what our Prophet told us amen uh so we we shall go to the book of First Corinthians 11 I've incidentally been asked as well to minister to evening light by the way I congratulate evening light right Tabernacle for the election their new associate pastor brother job gav understand so we congratulate him and pray for God His blessings amen that was for evening light amen we just go to First Corinthians chapter 11 so I'm also ministering for the Saints on Zoom I'm also ministering ing this uh here at at um uh dvf so if I if it is lengthy I'll continue and then maybe the brothers will will divide it into two and then the other part can be played later so just want us to be attentive because this is a bit doctrinal I said I'm really not going to give my opinions or ideas but I'm going to read and and give you the message can we say Amen to that chapter 11: we just read only one verse but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering [Music] Corinthians 11: amen you may be seated I'm going to speak to you this evening on the subject of long hair a woman is ornament and Glory so I'm requesting your undivided attention this is a a well you know a subject that is I don't know which word to use but it is debated on a lot even in the message we're talking about in the reals of the message of the so this debated on much each almost Pastor has his own take on it and um each Church looks at it differently but as I understand before I even get into it I'd like to say that I do not believe that we we will make it to the Rapture on the basis of work I believe God is going to best on the on our faith and so if long hair for women or or hair inself as a teaching if if it's part of the word then it is the word our faith in the word matters how we approach it how we believe it and so I'm not going to teach a bunch of works this evening I'm just going to touch a little bit on a part of the word which I believe is as important as the rest of the world if you are found wanting in one area or the other just correct yourself and let's go on as Christians amen and if you fine then that's glory to God long hair a woman is ornament and Glory so you see um in the amplifi that verse which I read in the Amplified says but if a woman has long hair it is her orament and Glory so if a woman has long hair that long hair is her orament and Glory I do not know what what the word ornament is in luganda but I think that's the right word is like a decoration yeah yes you see if a woman if a woman wants to be well decorated then surely hair must be a part of it the Bible says long hair is her hament and is her glory so you see if even if a woman really dresses so well but but her head is shabby you know or she doesn't have hair on her head she looks funny that's the truth is that right because you see hair is so much a part of a woman's uh adorning but we see it also has some spiritual connotations to it and that's what I want us to get into and and and everything about it so it is honor and glory for how long hair is given to her as a covering so now the Bible says it is her honor it is her glory and also it is her covering and then he says that she should not even pray in the same chapter she should not even pray or prophesy with an uncovered ha so ha is her covering all right so now we see here that the Bible says not just hair but it says long hair praise the name of the Lord and as we get into it let me just read I'm going to read a lot of quotes today so get ready and brothers if you can be able to get those quotes and put it on the screens for the people to follow I will appreciate that so I'm going to first of all read from questions and answers part four where the Prophet says why is it that we make so much of a big issue of women's dress somebody ask brother and he says oh I'm getting on this one big issue of women is dressing and cutting of hair nothing said about the hair of man or the way he dresses and then he answered this person and the only reason why I'm reading this because someone may may say what about us why are you not talking picking on men looks like you're talking so much about the the women and he says well sister I'm going to agree with you on one thing first place the bible say that a man should not have long hair and if he had long hair I would tell him just the same as I tell you he's wrong but most men lot lots of them like are like me he says not like me like The Prophet by the had a bold head but most men cut their hair you know they look like men now if they don't do it they would be not they would be told not to do so if they don't if they don't if they let their hair grow out they would be told not to do so we we would also tell them not to do so to leave their hair to grow out like a woman's hair they be Reed and if indeed we see some brother here not trying to let their hair grow out like a r or something we tell them no brother that is wrong so now I I'm going to bring this in a way of question I'll be dealing with one question after the other and the first one is what is long hair ask your neighbor what is long hair in the book of First Corinthians the same chapter we have read vers 3 11: 3 uh we are going to read up to verse six he says but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God every man praying or prophesying having his head covered this hor his head do you understand that part he says every man praying or prophesying having his head covered this horn has his head so he's not talking about a man dising his head he's talking about the man dising Christ because he say the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man so if a man covers his head dising Christ but every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered now this is really where the whole thing begin many people have misunderstood this portion of scripture and I want us to understand it very well he says but every woman that prays all prophesies with her head uncover first of all correct that when he says prophesies is not saying preaching so if if a woman prays or prophesies with head uncover Dison her head if you understand it say Amen so now what does this mean so we have understood already that the head of every woman is the man so we see that if she if a woman has an uncovered hair she is dishonoring her husband but you see uh he continues on here to say just hold hold your thoughts together now for that is even all one as if she were shav so now he says if a woman prays or prophesies her head cover her head so what does that mean it means if a woman prays or prophesies certainly of course we pray every day we prophesy every day so if a woman in other words have an uncovered head dishonors her husband if she's not married she's dishonoring Christ are you following m I need to hear your amen okay now if you're following me here then it continues and says it is the same as if if she's not covered it is the same as if she was shoven or sh okay so what is the covering what does a covering mean the covering of course as we read in the beginning the covering is the hair so the woman is covering is the hair for the scripture says for her hair is given her for her covering so now if she doesn't have long hair she should shave everything off but he says if it is a shame for a woman to be shown or shaven let her be covered how will a woman be then covered a woman can only be covered with long hair right now he's not talking about a scarf or something that you put he's talking about hair long hair some says does it even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a shame but if a woman has long hair it is a glory so then what does long hair symbolize it symbolizes a covering so a covering is equals to long hair and as we get into the message here you'll find that long hair is actually talking about uncut hair says if a woman is not covered let be shet so what does it mean if a woman cuts her hair or trims it or reduces it and makes uses the word b it is the same as if she I mean if she does that then she should remove everything but because it is a shame for her to remove everything then let her be covered let her have long hair let her not touch her hair let her not trim her hair cutting your hair means you have an uncovered hair short hair does not mean trim um you know many people think that oh long hair means hair that goes all the way down but you see in Africa here we do not have any I do not know of any tribe that has hair all the way down Ethiopians have nice hair but still a little bit different so in other words long hair is uncut hair no matter how short it is it may be short this short or this this but as long as it is not trimed it is long hair but you see if you reduce it you know like mine is not long hair I may even have a bigger hair I can choose to have a bigger hair you see but as long as I keep trimming it and making it look tiny then it is not long hair so long hair is is uncut hair tell your neighbor long hair is uncut hair Hallelujah so uncovered to be uncovered is to Tre or cut your head to be shaven means to remove everything let's see what our Prophet says in questions answers on Hebrews part paragraph 757 now we just now we get just a minute and show you that the hair of the woman is her cover for that even he says is not in the scripture even all as one as if she was sheven that means if she's going to cut her hair then shave it all off you see for even for if the woman be not covered let her also be shown sh means sh but if it be a shame for a woman to be Shan or sheven let her be covered so in other words if if you if she doesn't want to be asame she shouldn't touch her hair she should let her let her hair grow out she should not Tre her hair Believers Christians don't trim their hair Believers women they don't trim their hair they don't cut their hair why because your hair is your covering but if you decide to cut it and do your gen cut then he says you should cut everything off completely shave itle SH now he says now we are getting right down to the question here you are asking all right now is it wrong for a lady to cut a hair according to the Bible now as I'm contining to read this quot for you I understand there are some people who think what brother bam says does not matter but I believe and in this church we believe what our Prophet says matters because he is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 he is the one that brought the message that is preparing us for the second coming of Jesus Christ he is our Authority in this day you know every preacher can have their opinion every church can have their opinion but you see Believers opinions is the message of the hour because you see brother bam pointed us to the Bible did not believe there is nothing butam say that is against the Bible every teaching he told was already in the Bible there is nothing new there is even new no new idea he doesn't when he talks about it he doesn't bring his opinion when he asks questions he doesn't bring his opinion he speaking what the word what the Bible says to the extent sometimes as I will read for you here some questions it says I don't know he said I don't know but I can give you my opinion but I don't know I will only take what the word says I will tell you the message of the hour amen is not a new message it's the message direct to the Bible if we want to understand what the Bible says we have to refer back again to the message I've heard people who claim they say oh no no no brother bam went wrong here according to who according to their own interpretation should we take your interpretation or we should take our prophet's interpretation of the Bible Amen in the Book of Amos 3:7 he said surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveal his Secrets Hallelujah to his Ser us the prophets and we have a prophet in our generation it is his revelation of the word we believe it is what we take it is what we are standing on it is what has made us what we call message Believers what message do we believe we believe the message of William Bram which has taken us and pointed us to Christ Jesus anyone who interpretation is their own interpretation according to themselves and they are not Vindicated but our Prophet Hallelujah he is a Vindicated by the prophet God came down and himself with him and he said I am with this man and therefore we are on right ground when we take his interpretation of his word God is his own interpreter and how does he interpret it using His prophets praise the name of the Lord and so that should settle that for a Believer they claim to be a message believer they should believe what their messenger says I ought to have 100% Amen on that they claimed that they can correct brother bam on this and that and they were lost completely lost in their denominations before williamh but after he came now they were able to understand what the Bible was saying but now theying claiming they can correct the prophet you cannot correct a prophet a man who hears from God you cannot correct him because when he comes he comes with th say the Lord and everything he preached was he a man oh yes he was did he make mistakes oh yes he did but every mistake he God corrected him and he corrected it on T and so we have a perfect message a perfect message which does not need interpretation which does not need debate or father trying to explain what he said I believe it it and that's how every believer must that should be where we stand and we here as days of the voice Fellowship that is where we stand every message that is where we stand praise the name of the Lord and so it's an authority we are reading from not just some manmade idea so then he says I continue here for a for a man okay this is interesting now we we getting right down into the question here you are asking all right now is it wrong for a lady to cut a hair okay it's not a question this one is not a question it is a statement I'm sorry he says all right now it is wrong for a a lady to cut her hair according to the Now you listen right here and see if the Bible don't give a man a legal right to put away his wife if she cuts her hair see if this is right or not of course later on he explains and he says you see because her hair is given her for coverage but you see if she is uncovered she uh does not H her head and who is a woman head her husband so if she's dishonorable to her husband then that's why he says oh then the Bible gives a man right to put her away okay I will not explain that like I said we just believe what it says for a man in in in the Jewish old Jewish States you know when a man died a husband died a woman would remove her hair as a symbol that she's been Dishonored you know so you see but a woman dare not cut her hair when a husband is alive for a man indeed ought not to cover his head that is he says that is have long hair for as much as is the image and glory of God but the woman is the in the glory of the man did you ever think of that now I want to stop here because I want this to sock in real good and I remember I've seen tens of thousands of lovely women know them right now and plenty of them sitting in this church that has short hair that is Christians and while I lay it onto onto is not you it is the way you have been taught you you your preacher never told you this but if any of the women around this Tabernacle around this church then you are guilty he was speaking to crowds and many people all over and so today we can say there are many Christians all over the world that actually cut their hair personally I was from the Anglican Church they reawakened Revival and you know when a woman would believe the first thing they would do is to cut off her hair because they misinterpreted some part of the scripture in Isaiah where they where it say that oh where there was long hair I I'll leave the head Bal because he was talking about it was talking to the hty women that had left the Lord and forsaken the Lord was a sweet um beautiful smell or put a bad order and things like that so they thought oh yeah you see so God doesn't like hair he likes short hair but that's a missing interpretation of scripture and there are many Christian women today actually have short hair they cut the treatment and today we have even leaders in the government women who have short hair and you see it's becoming a trend you find them trimming it trimming itm it you know and they think it is fancy but you see that is the same as bobbing hair triming hair or cutting yeah same and the scripture says a woman should have long hair and cut hair but he says to you a Believer you know better you should not do what they doing because for you you are told you know you shouldn't touch your ha praise the name of the Lord and so I continue on here he says but if a woman has long hair is a glory to her he said glory to her if you have long hair say Amen now he says now what's he talking about a heart that you Catholic people wear in church he says no indeed are little covering over the top of your head with a handkerchief you know you know and then he says he's talking about your hair now and if a woman cuts off her hair she cuts off her glory and is not permitted to the alar to pray that means in the presence of God see just what it said here is it a common thing for a woman to go pray with a head and covered says well she's got well she got to cut her hair so let her be if she wants to cut her hair then let her be shaved of s I think we call it here and if she's going to be sh of sleek if she's ofle is say that's at this hor it's a dishonor to her head it's a shame for a woman to do that then say she ought to be covered now I'm just reading Paul's letter that's all up to you so you see he's saying I'm all I'm doing I'm giving you the word the rest is up to you questions part three says then if she says she must she has to cut it off then let her be shaved and said if she's um and if it's a shame or disgrace for a woman who is supposed to look pretty and having her hair all shaved off then let her hair let her have her covering on her head let her have long hair now basically we there are many things I'm going to cover but the major point of scripture regarding woman is ha is this one a woman should have long hair and long hair remember his uncut hair now I understand God has given you know us God is a god of variety you find some people some resters have longer hair and others have shorter hair you know but but God is a god of variety and he loves all these races and I will tell you what it is more beautiful to be the way God made you but you see when God gives you the hair he gives you it's going to be long hair as long as you don't cut it the moment you cut it then it is short hair even if it looks long it is short hair but if you don't cut your hair and you stand together with a sister from say London you know she's a European her hair goes to the and goes up to the shoulder but before God both of you have long hair but you see if even if even if her hair is up to the feet and she trims it it is no longer long because it is dream and for men the scripture says it is a shame for us to have long hair so brother always keep your hair shap it don't become a you find people wanting to become a they have spe of oh you know some other people you know they want to have the wrong dreads a Believer a Christian man how can you desire something like that you should want remember you know you should want to give God the glory in everything that you do praise the name of the Lord so the question is why have long hair then for the Sisters of First Corinthians 10 1110 it says for this cause the woman to have power on her head because of the angels and I'm going to um just read a small short quote out of the talken he says long hair this stand me it says long hair is a Nazarite vow and I don't think it is a coincidence where he says the woman ought to have power on her head you remember how many remember Samson you know Samson had a Nazarite vow with naite vow Works he kept the power for as long as he did not put a Le Bread on his head he had the power he was the most powerful man in Israel for as long as his head was not touched with the R so we see here he says it show that that you've cut yourself from the world to obey the word and I Believe Christian women they are showing that they have obeyed the word and they have cut themselves from the W and they have a Nazarite vow with samon let his hair grow out for aite vow and I believe our sisters the Bible says you see a woman has to have power on our head because of the Angels explain that part of the Angels I'm sorry I'm going to read a lot of stuff for you today and I just want to be attentive and in the message oness says a woman wrote me a question the other day she said brother Bram oh no it was a man a minister he may be standing here this morning from some place in Ohio we want to say the same thing that you do but we found something on your tapes that's not right these were some like some of the preachers today who read some quotes of this is not correct so Billy brought me the letter Billy brought the letter to me said something on your T is very contradictory by the to the word of and we want to say what we want to say the same thing you know said one question I want to say to you that's First Corinthians the 11th chapter it says that about the head covering for the women and the men not to have a covering said we believe that the women should wear hearts in the church this is a letter a letter that these people sent to brother B and the men should take their hearts off in the church say we believe them head coverings and so forth and said then another question is that the people come to us and they say the angel of the Lord speaks everything to you every word that you speak is from the angel of the Lord and brother bam it is so hard to fight against something like that said in my church said we want to say the same thing now brother Bram don't you believe that you was a little in error there cuz now they according to them they say that a woman should have a heart and a man should remove his heart so and they saying by the BAM you are the way you explained it to us don't you think you are in error and he says I wrote back do you want to hear what the prophet wrote my precious brother I am not in error hallelujah our Prophet is not in error the First Corinthians the 11th chapter say a woman should have her head covered and why the 15th verse said her long hair long hair is given to her for cover not a heart that Catholic Spirit dominated the church long enough how long hair is her covering teach and look and then the question come back somebody asked me sometime ago I'll explain it while I'm at at it he said well the bible say that she should have long hair because of the Angels what is the Angels going to do with a woman I said what is an angel It's a messenger what is Paul saying if a true Messenger an angel from God comes by You' better have long hair he will condemn the thing Willem that that's right that means every Ang of God every man of God every preacher from God will condemn women having short hair will condemn women cutting their hair that is it so which means men or pastors who actually let their women cut their hair or trim it or do things like that They Are Not Angels of God simply put praise the name of the Lord a messenger from God will condemn it said you better have long hair because of the Angels the messenger sent from God comes by Will condemn that s yes indeed because a real messenger from God an angel is connected with God and his word Can't Fail that's exactly right St Paul said there that even if an angel from heaven come and told anything else let him be a cur that's right now we find out that that's true she should have long hair that's her covering but he says um I imagine this pretty moabite women were very beautiful they might have been fixed up some like some of the modern Jezebels of today but however not all women I think a woman that's genuine a woman that is genuine is a jewel praise God for a real woman we have real women in this church the B said you are a Jew you are God's [Music] handmaid yes but a real woman is like a real is like a real man they will follow the word of God regardless of what the devil and they say our Pastor said it's all right to do this you know actually actually there some pastors who are so invested in other things they would tell the women don't do this don't do that in your hair don't do that in your [Music] ha for cutting that's okay you find a girl a big girl 20 years she's because she's a student so C and because she's not married so then she's not a Woman They say she's not a woman she can cut what happened to teaching children and raising them in the way they should go the Bible says raise up a child in the way should go when they grow they will not depart from it from childhood God should know their hair is their Glory hair is Untouchable it should not be cut it should not be reduced it should not be removed and he says and our Pastor said it's all right to do this I don't care what your pastor said if it is contrary to the word of God let your pastor's word be a lie and keep God's word I don't care what denomination it is or what if he's got anything to say about it let him look into the word of God listen friends we don't care what the world says and the system of the world say a woman a man the father of the house you should have a backbone of standing for the word and teaching your family to stand for the word can we have people who believe that and say Amen we should stand for the word because the word is not our word is the word of God so you see from a god from childhood she should be raised up knowing that my hair is my [Music] glory amen and I thank God all my three girls are ra has never touched their head since they were born yes and someone said oh when a child is born you know you need to First remove that first layer of the hair so that they can have the beautiful hair where did you get that idea from he is not in the message I don't say what you're doing is wrong but what I'm saying is I would rather you teach them while they were young from childh I believe Samson from childhood no touched his and I believe God has given you girl children raise them from childhood them knowing my hair is my no res blade touching my hair no sciss touching my hair no machine touching my hair my hair is given me for a covering praise the name of the Lord and so it is a shame having fathers and mothers Believers of this message because they want a good school so for their children and they take them to a school where they cut hair well of course we want to take what the messengers told us what the Bible says amen we have now many schools which will actually accept girls to have long hair if this school doesn't allow you change the child to another that will allow you have a backbone for the word and God will stand with you every part of the word is God's word there is no small word big word every word is big word and every word of God is perfect word so my sisters have your hair grow out don't cut your hair don't reduce your hair leave it to grow for that hair is your glory if you cut it if you reduce it it is better you remove everything and you remain clean clear sheven but it is a shame for you to be that way you should let your hair grow up hallelujah amen the God of this evil age says and a woman that will cut a hair dishonors a head is a sinful thing for a woman to offer prayer with short hair do you believe your Prophet oh only 10% that believe do you believe your Prophet are these message Believers here today it is a sinful thing for a woman to offer prayer with short hair I don't understand it either but I believe it the Bible said so pray in public with a hair uncovered or you say I wear a heart oh these next words are very powerful now listen don't be offended now just believe it he says he say you say I wear a heart he says you hypocrite teach them women such things as that when the Bible said her hair is given her for cover not some man made heart that's why the Bible said I am not responsible I am only responsible to tell the truth don't be dishonest as the Bible says handling the word of God with deceit to fix or to meet the request of a bunch of we say what he says and that settles it praise the name of the Lord and so there is no way I can deal with the hair talking about the issue of plating the hair because you see this is has been an issue and it's been brought up many times but you see how Prophet has been very clear what he has emphasized is what is in First Corinthians and he said women should have long hair long hair is uncut hair and somewhere else actually he says after that I don't know where to go there are many other ideas this that this and that before I read the next things what I want to tell you is really after that is what the Holy Spirit leads somebody to do you need to understand what I'm saying amen Beyond a woman having uncut hair you see you see beyond a woman having uncut hair yeah you said it right after that and beyond that we have no laws or rules now someone told you Pastor when you say that you give people a license to do everything the world is doing well I would say this is a clear sign those people who will do everything the world is do are not filled with the Holy Ghost because if you're filled with the Holy Ghost he would literally tell you everything about your life the Bible says he will show you things to come he will guide you into all truth he will make sure you don't go into error that is the work of the Holy Spirit he will tell you even what cloth to wear you may like a good jumper a good and then you go see that word on it and the Holy Spirit will tell you no don't buy this one and you walk away from me and someone will tell you but this is what you wanted the Holy Spirit has told me you see the Holy Spirit should lead us how even what design to have in your head how to keep your hair even what kind of pom or pom or or J or whatever you want to call it whatever you're putting there the Holy Spirit should lead you on those because if he doesn't quite frankly you may do what your pastor tells you to do but you will never please God because pleasing God is on the basis of faith not faith without faith it is impossible to please God praise the name of the Lord and so now uh on that basis I'll will now approach this issue of plating there first Timothy 2:9 in like manner also that women Ador themselves in modest appar with shamefacedness and sobriety not with braded hair or gold or Ps or coly AR but which becometh women professing godl with good works [Music] okay so now when people read this many people in the denominational world before they even received the message they said women should should not braid their hair women should not you know and things like that and they should not wear gold PS and clothes but you see you need to understand the speed behind this scripture and before I read what our Prophet says I'll read what the Amplified version says likewise I want women to Ador themselves modestly and appropriately and discretely in proper clothing not with elaborately braided hair you can get it you can do it brother I'm sure you can he says not with elaborately braided hair okay and gold or P or expensive cloes but instead Ador by Good Deeds helping others as is proper for women who profess to worship God so now you understand that Believers must always be different from the world the world will always be different from Believers you see is not it's not possible for a Believer to copy the styles of the world the new dress that has come up by the way those cheap cheap clo that show their body you will find is very expensive and then you wonder why why is a woman spending 500€ 1,000 on such a cloth what the speaking about here the Bible is not saying women should not all together wear clothes oh should not wear good clothes that are expensive but he's saying they should not wear such wildly fashionable expensive clothes the Bible is not saying here that believer should only buy second hand no that's not what it's saying you will not buy a new cloth because the Bible says we should notar we expensive cloes no you you can actually wear a cloth of 200,000 even 500,000 for as long as it is way different from the fashion of the world and then here is's talking about elaborately elaborate braided hair you know you do what they do the pencil you do the pencil are you a Believer there a problem somewhere the new fashion in town you find a Believer doing it there is a problem the Bible says we should not amen be conformed but we should be renewed in our mind transformed by the renewing of our mind we are transformed by the word of God of the word we leave it alone there is no rule do this do this do this do this know don't put wuzi in whatever there is no law like that but what we are saying what is worldly leave it for the world but you see a Believer who is a Believer but he looks like wildly problem there that's what the Bible is talking about here gold the Bible is not say to wear gold but you see Believers don't wear gold like the unbelievers but it is not a sin to wear go are you hearing me gold and P is talking about jeel is it a to wear those things it's not a sin to wear them but you see the way the world does is not the way the Believers do you know a nice you know ho ghost F woman can have a wedding God ring may even maybe be given a necklace by a husband a good neckace simple and doesn't look elaborate and kind of things you know but you'll never find a Believer wearing you know earring and having 10 kog in the chest putting here putting here even hands can't touch properly because all over they are filled with gold and Po and and silver and here you see when you see a Believer you can see there's a difference between the believer and the world now first Timothy 2:9 is speaking in that line saying these things are wrong to do but he saying we should not do it like the world that's why said I only after scriptures he said don't don't cut your hair and don't look like the world and the rest I don't know what to say praise the name of the Lord so now he is questioned here in questions and answers part one brother Bram does this first Timothy 29 mean a woman cannot braid her hair does braid hair mean braided hair notice braided hair in that day was a sign of a street woman that is what she done braided her hair and Paul said to the Christians now that adoring not not don't let it be the braided or braided or braid is the same thing to braid their hair because it looked like the rest of the [Music] world even today you can braid your hair and you look wildly and you can braid your hair and you look saintly so what is the Judgment what's the best of judgment is the Holy Spirit you should judge by the spirit of God you see the Bible says everything is lawful to us but not everything is expedient e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e should really at least you have put everything it's not a doctr praise the name of the Lord if you have the spirit of God you will not copy the styles that you see in the world you will want to dist yourself from what you see the women of the world praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen I I'd like you to give me a few more minutes I I I summarize because there some portions like on things that bam talks about he calls them rats and wigs and questions and answers part four he says if a woman has got real thin hair and she wants to wear one of those rats orever what you call it my wife wears it she says her hair is thin and she got some kind of a thing about a big around looks like a great big oversized biscuit I don't know I think you know those rats not not not even a wig that's a hairpiece p i I searched it i i al also was thinking it is a it's um um how do you call it I was thinking it is a uh a wig but a rat is something else it's like I don't know how many women know it [Music] they call it under the hair and then the hair looks big as if it is mat it's also called a wig it's also called a Weg you have a word for it weave weave I wouldn't there something else you go search a hair rat you'll find something I don't think we use it much here in Africa because our hair is not usually that much and that kind of texture but anyways it says his wife was wearing it and some of it is a wig you know the one that also you can wear and you know she's um and she wraps her hair around okay the one that she was wearing she puts it there and then she wraps her hair around it and pins it as far as I'm concerned he was asked what about that he said that don't bother anything as long as your hair is long Minister said his wife was condemned because she had a tint in her hair and I found out from a question that means that means a paint or a coloring in a I can't say that is wrong I have nothing about it if she got long hair that's all I can say about it for the other one I don't know what to say this person said this morning taking off their hair and putting it back on and now this kind of got here too about a haircut now if a man doesn't have hair oh his wife I've heard a woman say well if I could just get John I think he would look better if he had a if he wore a hairpiece what do you think about it brother BR you know like some men they actually have bold head so it says it would he would look better my husband look better if you would have put on a we you see I think I don't think we do that much here in Africa if you what do you think about it brother bam is it wrong for him to do it I'm sure 100% of you would say brother says yes it's sinful but here is what he said no sir no indeed it is not wrong not at all if he wants to wear no more than wearing teeth or whatever that come along by the way I've got three for Te myself I wish they didn't have them they are on a wire and they always Shen my voice and they cut my tongue and everything else so he says um so I I I um when I'm overseas on them outside meetings I wear a hairpiece not because for the looks of it because you know I would stand right here and I don't I didn't have a hair on top of my head and whatever it was it wouldn't make no difference I'm here to represent Jesus Christ I love that attitude showing it not wrong to do those things but I don't care how I look it's all about Jesus Christ but you see he's trying to show you the motive behind what you're doing but when I stand out there about the first night in one of them tropical storms the next night my throat is so so I can't get up so if it was something I wanted to do and Fa to do it I fail to do it I would do it yes sir there is not a thing says not to do it not a thing say sister that you you can't wear a rat or switch of hair or something or another that's perfectly all right but let your hair stay long and man you cut your off what you got keep it cut and woman you dress like a woman and man you dress like a man don't try to be a siss and wear some women's clothes and women don't you try to be myle and wear a man's cloes because God don't want you to do it the Bible condemns it but now about wearing a hair a piece of hair or wearing a hair well what is one of those rats something a woman puts in her hair to make it look more ever what it is there is nothing wrong with go ahead it's all right now do we believe this to be the word of God do we believe it to be the word of God now I understand the Believers who believe it like I do that have your natural hair and brother B believe that too he keeps pushing for that look natural look look the way God made you look and when you go in some of Evangelistic sermons that's why people ask this question because he was hitting on these things putting on these addons and things he always meting on it and these people asked him questions is it wrong he says no it is not wrong so now you find some very good old um Unholy ghost a person who is not filled with the Holy ghow praise God the prophet said is not wrong and then from the church they just go I want the best wig how much the wi how much the week the pastor read for us the prop he said it's not wrong why did you take that part why didn't you take the part that says stay with your natural hair a problem with your experience so you see you find Brothers would say if a sister we a wig she's going to hell they are not Believers you are wrong our Prophet said it is all right but it's it's not all right for me as a person I have my personal walk with the Lord and if I want my natural hair I want my natural hair I want to look that way I want to present myself that way I to be natural but the other who has small Revelation not filled with the Holy Ghost I'm not going to throw him to hell because he's doing what I cannot do you find someone dressing up to down and and and and and and you and and you you are dressing up to here below the knee and then you who dressing up to down sister you are going to H unless you repent what is my sin it is not a sin for her to dress a right is it a sin but I tell you for sure if I was choosing a wife I would not look for the one who dresses like this I would look for the one who is dressing up all the if I'm looking for a wife I won't look for the one with a wig why are you fake I want original I will look for the original sister with natural hair but as far as Doctrine is concerned it is all right you understand church so you have to be balanced in your approach and I was so shocked when bam dealt with this issue of if it says if it is wrong for me is it wrong for me to run a bit sh atian and don't believe in Christians cutting her hair but I cut others hair and I and I tint I tint their hair sister dear I wouldn't know what to tell you listen I can't say for women about that putting color in their hair I have no scripture against that I can only stay with the scripture I love my prophet he always right on scripture the scripture don't say for them not to do that the scripture says she must have long hair and after that I don't know where to go so if you you want your tint I don't know where to go but as your pastor I'm going to ask you do you have the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost want you to tint your hair so the prophet never assumed the position of the Holy [Music] Spirit why do we do it as pastors we should let the Holy Spirit do his work in the people but we should preach the word we should be instant in season the word will always correct the error you find people who are always picky this one looks like that he says here the scripture don't say for me to tell D not to do that the scrip says she must have long hair after that I don't know where to go don't know nothing about that hey my praise God now little minister is present here somewhere I know a dear friend of mine we was talking together the other day at the blue ball when we was having dinner he said my wife's kind of ashamed to come before you a very saintly goodly little woman she's pretty little lady grandmother and but she's nice a clean little you know my wife's just crazy about this woman and I think she's a real real woman I don't know if she's sitting here I guess she is I think her husband is here and she said to me he said she let her hair grow out after she had you preach and she seen it it was right but say she's been using some coloring in her hair and she's trying her best to get all that color to grow out before she comes around where you are hallu [Music] now look sister dear I high respect that I have a honor for a woman that will do that for some woman just to come up and do her hair anywh speit in your face and walk around arrogant and no respects at all remember Jesus said what you do to these little ones you do it unto me and I respect that in you sister God will bless you for that but sister about the hair color or something like that I don't know don't you want to be led by a prophet who says I don't know when he doesn't know this is sincerity I can't back that up with the scripture that is up to you oh Pastor don't read that quote people are going to get spoiled look those without the holy spirit will be but those with the holy spirit will feed on the word you if you want to do it that's perfectly all right with me as far as I know the church has no such custom anything that's not in in this Bible that's up to youu but I'll give you my advice you see as far as I would know it's just the nature of women to want to look pretty she's supposed to be that way you know in every life there is the male is [Music] prettiest and you know I don't know whether I should read you this story but maybe I should skip it because of time but here he was talking about you need to go and read that yourself you can see the quote up there and those of you who are following online you can as well do it and and read it on on your own because of time questions and anwers 6 4823 a.m. excuse me they were speaking about the woman wanted to be pretty and look beautiful and in every other creatures the male is the prettiest but you see in the human race the woman is the and they said why she caused the fall Satan chose her and beauty is of the devil after brother bham stands he doesn't condemn according to the Bible this sister who has color in her hair and he says anyway it's all right it's up to you I cannot say it is wrong as far as I'm concerned but then he continues on and he says you see women it is in their nature to want to be beautiful but then he says why you see you see the female to the human is the most beautiful she caused the SAT chose her right there and beauty is of the devil Satan was the most beautiful angel he was the CH beam that overshadow look how different the woman is getting now to what they used to be and then he talks about a woman called PA briyan who was very beautiful at the time and now he says there are others who are much more beautiful than her you see and then it says just exactly what the Bible said when the sons of God saw the daughters of men were fa that was a bunch of Renegades that sent flood upon the Earth that God destroy the whole human race and today everything is based upon Hollywood and beauty and things like that when beauty is the secret thing of the heart I just pray that you you open your mind to receive this he's trying to to say here naturally a woman wants to look beautiful that's why they do all the things they do they will tell you show me why does the bible condemn me when you see a Believer when you read this quote you will see beyond what the prophet say is showing you what that has caused the world from the very beginning with Eve wanting to be beautiful right over to the devil he is the most beautiful by the way do you know Satan is beautiful some people thought the devil is some ugly guy with some horns Satan is very beautiful very beautiful he was one of the Angels God doesn't have ugly angels and when he fell he didn't become ugly see all the prostitutes see all the boys out there that the devil uses to destroy a generation beautiful and handsome the devil doesn't choose any ugly person by I can tell you preachers who are very ugly but I don't know a singer who is ugly the olders who were singing music taking people to hell they look so presentable and so beautiful and so handsome and so nice and you know they do this makeup thing and make their hair certain way and things like that you see and it says it was a bunch of Renegades that sent the floods upon the Earth to destroy the whole human race and today everything is based upon Hollywood Beauty and things like that and he says what is beauty beauty is supposed to be a secr thing of the heart that's what Timothy was saying amen that's what you know we read here you know Peter that's what Peter was saying the secret beauty of the heart that should be what the woman has how much je she has how she makes her hair but how she's so beautiful me humble cont in spirit able to take God at every word let them ad themselves not without whaton of appearance but word me and gentle that is the Christian praise the name of the Lord so he says I can stop right now or take another 30 minutes praise the name of the Lord and I think me too as well and he goes ahead to speak about um you know a hair actually I love the way he talked about uh the the cap the socks cup the socks cap you know they do that during the time of coldness and I think you will love this quote as I'm approaching to finish here and losing my hair as a young man putting carbonic acid on it AB did and took it all out when I was just a boy and it's been always a kind of a thing to me and I get cold so quick because of my scalp is still soft you know and the roots of the hair is still there it was burnt by carbonic acid can never grow so I went and I went my wife and I long years ago and got a hair piece to wear a little piece of hair I was always ashamed to wear it because it looked like it was something false and I didn't want nothing false how many want something false praise the name of the Lord oh I think lug we have a good one the prophet says I didn't want nothing forse I believe if you Holy Ghost fi you won't want anything false and so I thought I would just put on a stocking C yes that I did for a while you know what they did you know what they did they wanted to call me a bishop there then they said you know the way you put it on it makes you look like a pop or something so they began calling me Bishop so I said let her go so I just I just suffer out of the B he raising them windows you know and so my you fellows that's got hair you don't know how thankful you should be and that is right sister if you have your long ha let it grow out leave even this F hair alone you know leave these kind of things let your hair if you have it let it grow out I know I've seen some sisters who really truly do not have hair and surely they will need a that's a very very good reason I know of one who even refused to wear a wig he said God must make my hair grow I don't want to look false hair out God gives you according to your desire but you have hair you are putting weak putting you know something else be natural look like a Christian are you saying I'm wrong I'm encouraging you as your pastor on which way you should go praise the name of the Lord I wouldn't think it would be if it would be for a man if he wanted to wear a hairpiece it would be for a woman to wear one of those mouses or rats ever what they put in their hair like that to make it up but because if you do it it depends on what you doing it for it depends on what you're do and as I was about to finish studying I came across this quote in the message the resurrection he say did you ever think that the color of the hair that you got when you was a younger woman about 20 and you was a young man do you realize that it will be the same color of hair in the resurrection praise the name of the Lord I want to be original which means god tolds why he made me the way he made me I don't want to die my hair is it wrong or no it is not I don't want to do it I want to be the way God made me I myself because even in the resurrection I will appear the same way praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah let your hair grow out and stand as I read this last sad in the message Faith he says oh brother I don't care what some of this little overnight preaching does and it looks like today we have heard an overnight preaching but stick your chin up we are Sons and Daughters of God we made we may beated here but our father is a k how many believe that he says believe God don't matter what comes or goes conduct yourself like Sons and Daughters of God you women wash the paint off your face let your hair grow out again let your hair grow out you men that cigar put it out of your mouth and go out of here and act like Sons and Daughters of God put all this wasy Wishy doubling around about the place and conduct yourself like Sons and Daughters shall we pray father Lord there are many things that I might have said no doubt this is one of those long long services that have ever held here but I need to say all these things for our people and I pray Lord if there there's something said that is a miss a little bit may you correct it in the hearts of the people but most importantly we have heard the word may we take those little seats and may they impact our lives and may we desire to be more and more like you that we may resemble your image your sture your your nature that's how we want to be and for our sisters Lord we know that the beauty of the church is this is the people and if you want to know how the church is should look at how the sister they show the spiritual stat of the church if they carry on and and and go into all this jewly and kind of styles of the world of the father you will show that surely we are not feeding on the word but if they're feeding on the word you will surely draw them more to a quiet and mixed Spirit to desire to be like you more like granted father and if there is anyone with a question I pray that you will answer all those questions we give you praise in Jesus name amen God bless you church this is um one of the longest services that I've done here and I don't regret it because I believe um how many have been blessed uh now to those of you
