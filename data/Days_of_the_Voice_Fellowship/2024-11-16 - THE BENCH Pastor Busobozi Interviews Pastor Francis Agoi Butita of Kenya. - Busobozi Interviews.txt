last time we we we were meeting here at the bench we had uh Pastor Steven IAL one of the Elders in Uganda and today we are blessed to have um Pastor Francis ago BTA an elder from Western Kenya and there's a lot that we shall hear today this is usually orchestrated to be a blessing to the Young Generation especially the young uh ministers and also the Believers alike um for if the Lord Tes there's quite a lot that uh the next generation will want to to hear and to learn about how God dealt with these brothers that first believed in the message in our region here in East Africa and so allow me uh to welcome you sir thank you uh well we are so blessed to have you today here at the at the bench and to be able to talk to you if you would please kindly greet the people God bless you so happy to be here and to talk to you I know God is has a purpose he going to bless us together amen amen uh Pastor Francis I did not uh like I told the people here in the church that uh uh myself and yourself are Generations AP part but somehow the Lord was able to uh connect us and bring us together in such uh I should say Supernatural way because personally I did not know of you um being that um I'm much younger and and was start just starting out but um like I informed the people here at the church I got to learn of you and of the ministry uh in Western Kenya from one of ours our brother Timothy um who at the time had come to be with us in Ethiopia at that time I was with my wife and the family in Ethiopia so he happened also to be working there and we were able to link up with him and then he told us of of yourself and that's how how we got to learn of you um and I'm sure there are many people who do perhaps the younger ones also who do not know of course the older ones know know you but there are many younger ones that do not know you and um so there many questions I have I'm just trying to see where to start from okay but I think we will start from the very basic question uh how did you become a Christian let us begin there thank you thank you uh first of all if you have heard Pastor Francis atita uh from the western part of Kenya and uh the journey to be a Christian is a wonderful Journey um first of all from my youth school well it did something to my heart because somehow I had the the feeling of a god being somewhere but it it didn't take me to be a Christian so around the 10 age I think I went off I went off and by around 1970 7170 I went I went into deep world I drunk and smoked did everything but God is very gracious around 1972 just around around the turning on on of June something happened to my life that I can't explain it was as if I'm sick is as if I'm not I'm not sick I could not explain what I was the feeling was terrible but I wasn't sick I wasn't in pain and I I even went to the hospital they could not give me the the treatment so I was in school and I took off leave to go home and maybe find help but at home I didn't get help so I lay there on on my my bed from Monday Tuesday Wednesday I wasn't feeling okay the feeling had not left me on Friday I felt I must go back to school and I convinced my mother to let me go back to school so I went back to school when I went back to school I found that there was a a Pentecostal old man European who worked with the what used to be called the Trinity Fellowship okay he was called Mr doit he had a missionary to schools and to colleges in our country so that evening he had brought a film in our school okay I understood there was a film to be shown at the hall so I went there just like anybody else I didn't know this is now 197 72 1972 June that was 24th okay June so when I went to the hall there comes the this old man with a film and he puts on Billy gaham preaching in a crusade in Texas okay uh my heart seemed to have found what I was looking for and I was glued to the to the to the screen and as bil Graham would preach and would point a finger I would see him as if was pointing at me and I got I I wondered what what what is it so towards the end of the film when the the film ended yes I made a prayer I said God speak to this man to ask those who want to be save and for sure he asked for those want to be Sav and quite a number of the students more than maybe 100 moved to the front and he led us in what he called uh a prayer for the for salvation I did not pray that prayer as he he led the other boys into praying that prayer I was deeply praying and pleading with God to forgive my sins and just before he finished I don't know what happened I don't know how I knew it I said God if you have forgiven my sins fill me with the Holy Ghost now and something happened that I could not explain I felt such a power come upon my my my my my body right from the head into inside me as if some was pouring some good cool atmosphere into my soul and such a peace rested in my heart so after that I went to The Bard and I told him something has happened to me I don't know what it is and he told me there are two possibilities either an evil spirit or the Holy Ghost but we going to do this we are going to pray together if it is the Holy Ghost go to let him settle in your life and use you so we did pray with the old man and from there on my life was transformed amen the things I used to love I found I didn't love them anymore I used to love worldly music it didn't have t to me anymore in fact I went to the doet and when one of the one one of the boys was playing the music I Found the courage tell him to stop and he did and from in fact the next day everybody was looking at me in school with a very strange you know look MH something had happened from then I knew I was say yeah praise the lord well uh um first of all before we I comment on what just said if I can just request our listeners brothers and sisters if you can please share this link with all the others that would like to uh listen to this testimony because there are many many things that are about to be Sav that is going to turn your life around and change you and uh give you perspective especially about this message to be able to understand where we are where we have arrived what God is doing because what God did in the lives of others he also can be able to do in our life today in our generation and so if you can share this link with whichever group you are in and share with your friends invite them to come and be a part a part of this interview um one thing that is that really has always moved me uh is the humility and the sincerity of of Mo most of the oldtimers most of the brothers the oldtimers like our precious Pastor here Francis V very very humble people and it's not humility that is put on you can see is real sincerity coming from the heart and as you had that testimony you know God visited him and moved in his life now this is remember before the message came this before he even learned of the message this is just how he became a Christian so as we will hear later on how the message came to him and how he received the revelation of the word he had already been a true Christian in his heart and and changed filled the Holy Ghost and the life of the world already left him now um Pastor Francis uh you you you you receive a conversion in that moment you were a student at school I don't know how old you were at the time was about 18 18 and so did you become a church person from that moment on well in school they had what they call Christian union and I wasn't a member okay and actually I didn't become a member okay but what I did when they had meetings I would go to attend but I wasn't a member m uh when they would have R I would go at 10 but it came to a time during that time the Christian union leaders decided to approach me to tell me to take the so I took over the Christian union I wasn't a member but they asked me come please we see what we are doing is not is not what we we have and you able to meet so they invited me and gave me to leave the chran MH and that's how I I entered the still the same year 1972 yeah that's 72 or early 73 okay and so you start now ministering at the uh Christian scripture Union at the school and you are leading it and ministering to these people how then did you what was your first encounter with the message of brother BR uh what happened is now that I'm a Christian and now I have a desire to share with people what I what I've experienced the Christian union used to have what they called Sunday school teaching in other churches around the school so I decided to go to one of the Sunday schools to teach the young children but where I went I didn't teach the children the mothers and the fathers who are in the church said you are going to preach so for the first time I people outside when I did preach which church is this that was the fr the French Church H okay yeah I I noticed there quite plenty in Kenya of Kenya yes and from there I was invited several other small fellowships around the school so I kept on going around from this small Fellowship to this Fellowship this church this church and I made friends people knew me around the school now so in 1973 a sister tells me who was just from around the school tells me I have read a book and in that book God spoke to a man from a tree I said where is that book this is a friend from the quers yeah okay the sister from the quers yes yes she tells me she was a saved Christian from the quer church okay okay so she tells me I've read a book and in that book God spoke to a man for and this man is amazing so I say where where is that book say I'll give you so what I do I go to the sister's home over the weekend and I picked the book and the book I picked was a man sent from home when I saw the book I read the book I wept over the story about brother Bram and I thought brother was still alive so I wrote him a letter okay and asked him to send me books so what happened was books were sent to the school ctoons and c and books so many MH that every student was given three and the remaining were put in the library mhm now from there they also sent me the Sals a prophet uh 20 Cur prophet and the the booklet Lan church thank so I deled into reading the books and finding what was there okay well up to this time I thought brother Bram was a wonderful preacher I didn't know he was a prophet but I would get what was was reading the books and preached to the brothers in the school mhm we had Services every day after supper mhm so every day after supper I read from those books I did something I go to the fellowship and and preach with the brothers teach the brothers I did know it was a message for me it was just very wonderful preaching so you would read and enjoy it and then you preach to your share with other students what I've read tell them about the godhead how God is one them about baptism we went on like that and you know it is very amazing because I noticed there many Pentecostal preachers that have read the message of brother bham and they all they stopped there they did they did not have the grace to continue on with the further part of the message to understand it deeply and so here is where you had arrived you just you do not have the whole message but fractions of the message and whatever you read it was food to to your soul that's right and so we are now in 1963 still 773 oh sorry 19773 and so uh you already even preaching about baptism were you baptized yourself no I wasn't bapti mhm and by that time yeah and I was asking now Christians are being baptized in water what happens yes but I will continue to preach what I was reading the message but with some of the older Pentecostal I knew and one of them told me that man Le and therefore keep away from those books so already by that time there were people passing the news the wrong news that brother bham is a back preacher yeah so what I did I took my books and placed them somewhere and left them for some time but something happened I visited another sister and you know Pentecostals were having these materials and we didn't know they were even having tips country my mind so one of the pical sisters was having cassette player with the T of brother brandham okay so she gave me this T and told me take to brother so and so and don't listen to it so on the way I decided why did she tell me not to listen to it so I sat under the tree and put it on and who do I hear that good Preacher Brother Bram and as he preached I was not hearing everything but the anointing was overwhelming yes and I said this man is a prophet my my so I so you were reading his messages in books but this is the first time you will hear his voice yes so I go back to where I put my books I begin reading them again I now go to the brothers I was to I tell this man is a prophet because the anointing I fail I could all the English words was speaking but something in my heart would as if you know I was grabbing something from somewhere so I knew this man is a prophet and from there I decided to stand the message amen and uh so you you it's quite amazing the way you you you were given a cassette take it somewhere and then you end up you know listening to this message and you you were something moved on your heart that confirmed that this was of the Lord yeah and no wonder by the B preached the message the Deep cth to the Deep you right there must have been a deep calling in your heart and then there was a deep respond to that that's right and so when then did you CU did you know of any other believers of this message in in this part of the world not that time M I continued preaching but I was reading from the books not knowing there were other believers in the country okay then towards the end of 73 yes I got wi that there was a brother in a college near our place okay who knew the message so so somehow we connected around 74 okay and by that time we had finished college and gone back to Nairobi mhm we began to communicate uh I continued preaching and people were believing the message but nobody baptized them I was not baptized okay so you have a bunch of people they Believers you believer but there's no one to baptize no one to baptize I'm not baptized myself you're not baptized and so how did you to then go go on from there so now what happens 74 73 you know we are mixing sometimes with the Pentecostals sometimes with the message believer there was not really great good boundary yes so I finish my school and I decide I'm not going for form five MH because um I felt such a um an arge in my heart that I needed to stay around the West in place mhm and preach the message I don't know what was happening with me but that was a big pull in my heart mhm and my friends were all talking about going to form five and going to University I failed even if I passed well and of course I did I got my first division but I decided I would stay and P the message MH so come 75 uh now I'm not in school I went for time preaching about the message M then it came to around Easter M I decided we have to make a decision about the message so I went to the the college where this brother was because I I think he had told me there's a brother there who was baptized I went there MH asked him to baptize me he did baptize me early 75 mhm so I go back and Easter is coming I plan for a meeting and invite all the people are preach to the message MH tell them we have a meeting certain point all of you I'm inviting you to come mhm uh that week before Friday I take a few of message books I have and the Bible yes and I went to a brother's house there's a brother was a teacher Pentecostal brother mhm and because schools were closed his house would would be empty so I requested him to give me the house for that week MH so I go to that house I look myself there with my message books with my Bible and I did studying of the message I read the message to find I told God if these things are true just open them to me because I want to make a decision to act on it m so I read about the godhead I read about uh most of the doctrines I study the message I study the Bible MH then Friday um I decide uh those who come for the meeting during the Easter Friday I'll preach to them those who believe I'll baptize them yes so I borrow clothes from ladies I knew around I put in a suitcase some clothes from men I knew around I put in the suitcase I car the suitcase the church and I put it under the table then I preach I preach I ask are there any people here who want to be bapti and so many hands go up I say no listen I'm not talking about any other time I'm talking about now you want be baptized now they close here under the table you change and you be baptized and that day I baptized 11 people praise the Lord that was wonderful so immediately I baptized the people such a fear grip to me because it is not known in my area for such a young man to baptize people and he's not even an ordained preacher in any church is known or church so fear grips me and I I I hurriedly left that place going back home but the news went all over and then from there because everybody heard about the those who were baptized every weeked I would have people come to my my home and I would take them to the river baptize them sometimes I'd go the river several times in a day somebody comes I go to the river baptize them what happened after that is that people began to gather the river when they would see me go down just come people would run from all the from the other side and from the other side and gather the river so I would pre to them there then baptize the one I brought mhm and that went on some time so you became John John the Baptist of sorts then you know uh what has really moved me is uh the decision you made because I noticed this you know reminds me of the decisions I also made when I I I first heard this message comes to show that when someone hears the message the very first thing that will come to them when the message becomes a reality they will be first with a a decision to make yeah they have to make a decision whether to stand for this message because if they convinced they have to be concerned about sending out the message and so you decided to let go of your educational ambition at the time and you did not go to form five cuz it was not in the in that area you had to travel to Nairobi or some other place no I was to just within the area maybe bong side okay I would go for form five but you fail that you had to stay there I felt I must stay around my place yes because I felt the Brethren needed me yes yeah so for the sake of this message yeah and uh I wonder I wonder all of you who are listening to us today how many have made such a decision whereby you decide to sacrifice everything else it even seems as if you would sacrifice your life for the for the sake of the of the true faith of the Apostles what you have received because brother bham preached a message convinced and then concerned yeah I these days some young men can believe the message and even coming to church is a tag of War they feel the church is far and and and you know they cannot be able to walk to church if it's the little sacrifice they can make so and and so now you are baptized and then you baptized this this group of people and you now still you've not yet started a church that is the beginning of my church that's not the beginning of the church yeah from there now Services began to be in that place where it was a home of a sister we began Services there so we are now talking about 1975 yeah 1975 and amazing that is 50 years ago yeah and Al also the repercussion from the decision not to go to form five was so big especially you know those days people going to form five or something great and so my parents and everybody thought I was mad in fact they were saying I was mad at one time I was approach and told you know you are not normal so you have to be helped and Son of I almost believed they convinced you were crazy because of the of the of the decision you had made yeah and also the behavior and the uniqueness of the whole thing nobody have never known of somebody who comes from nowhere and Bing people and he's not compromising with the Unown religions yes and the Pentecostals are scared of him yes so it was it bring a lot of rpps around you see uh pastor vti this reminds me of um a scenario we had in Western I think South Southwest or western part of Kenya of Ethiopia we had a mission there with a a brother called brother beab and this is in his uh area where of course there were no message churches there I think until now we don't have a message church but we have a couple Believers there now yes but um most of them are Lutheran and others but you see they have a principle that if you die if a person dies you are buried uh at at the church if you're a Muslim they bury you at the mosque if you a Catholic they have their barrial grounds a Lutheran they have their barrial grounds and so if you leave your church for any new or unknown Faith they just excommunicate you and if you die they don't bury you they leave your body there for the birds of the air so it is kind of known that you are an outcast and that entire family is marked for Generations so when when I remember when I I hear your testimony it reminds me of that that you you accepted to to be an outcast that's right for the sake of the truth for the sake of the this message I don't know maybe I'll go ahead of myself a little bit do you have any regrets for doing that decision now 50 years later in fact I would say there's nothing I regret about mhm and there's nothing I missed mhm because what God has done for me in life cannot compare maybe I would have gone to form five maybe going to University maybe been something but I look at my friends who did that m and they're not much better mhm actually if is financially God has helped me so much mhm I have nothing to regret M he has blessed me he has given me what actually maybe I wouldn't have had if I had going the other side mhm yeah I was actually amazed you know our viewers you may not know when I was invited to go to kosi it's a rural area a rural setting and so but when I arrived I was a amazed when I I saw the church building it looked like a church building in in the middle of a city and when I I went later on the pastor took me to one of his projects yeah he owns a school and I was so amazed when I saw it like a very huge school with the buses and cars and many students I said my my in a ruler setting sincerely I I would agree with you when you say you have nothing to regret of because when you believe this message like the Bible says that se ke the first the kingdom of God and all its righteousness then all the rest of these things shall be added sure so um we are so blessed to hear a witness um a testimony like yours that can encourage us our generation that if we stand for this message we have nothing to regret of many years from now and you see that all these friends of yours actually many of them you much even better than them sure um this brings me to to a question um speaking of the message to you and this is to the viewers what is the message um you see people think the message is the books uh some think the message is following brother brandham but to me the message is God being manifested in your life amen when the word of God becomes real to you real in your heart revealed to you and you get the concept of what God is saying in your day I think that's what the message is all about um I know people call the books the message which is okay M but you can have the books just like somebody can have another book and you can um memorize the books just like somebody memorize a literature book but there's a difference when God takes those words and plants in your heart MH and it makes them real you can die for them amen makes them so real in your life you know the problem we have today people say they're receiving the message but what is the message the message is a revelation what God revealed mhm through the prophet of our day amen you see when the message was given to John the Baptist it was in symbols mhm and God will come and bring it out but it was in the symbols so when you get what is was when it symbols and it's revealed to you and you can hold it and you can live on it becomes part of you to me that's what I call the message amen Christ in you Christ in you so uh it's more than just knowledge it's a life sure it is more than knowledge it is more than just a group and more than just changing positions mhm it is something that touches on your life mhm yeah no wonder the people I've been following the testimonies like yours of the oldtimers even those in the US and in some other countries that first the first generation of the people that receed this message you could see that there life was a very simple life but also a very sincere life and God and there were people full of love Yeah in the beginning when you were telling us your testimony you spoke of listening to a tape of Billy Graham in in in our time now you find that even pastors ministers are fighting against other pastors who both claim to believe the message but when I read the message of brother banham he was so full of love that even when he talked about Oro Roberts or Billy Graham or any of these ministers he he would speak about them with with love and you could see that he truly loved them and and and so I don't know whether you see that there's something that we our generation has missed actually I'm so ashamed of what we are today uh where we have drawn circles all over and we try our best to be the only ones I think that should not be the case and I think brother ra didn't do that didn't teach us that that's right so we have a message that's not message where people are build build building personality camps mhm and personality Empire Empires mhm I think that's wrong M I believe that we may differ in principle yeah but you still my brother yes uh your approach to things may not be my Approach yes but I still should look at you as a brother M and of late recently that has been my my biggest preaching in the church mhm I've been calling my church not to draw any Circle yes and not to look at anybody as as not a good person mhm because they not in your Camp because he's not in my camp in any case these camps are not even it's just like denominations yes yeah exactly yeah so I feel a time if comes to some the minister to realize that the camps have no place in God MH that we are Breen we are sons of God we are Daughters of God and brother says if somebody says bad about you say good about him mhm if somebody does not love you love him amen and that's how we can conquer and you know brother brother Billy Paul the L was asked about the great miracle that brother banam performed he said the greatest miracle that he saw was he never saw he could not tell the difference between the enemy and a friend of brother banham you're right that he loved everybody and genuinely all right so when the life of Jesus Christ comes in an individual uh they they will have true love and even for the Cena to be able to reach out to them and and tell them the truth and so I understand that you organ organized the first Believers convention in Kenya and I've heard this from many other testimonies of other people that I've met in Kenya can you please tell us about that yes what happened was 1975 I was just a college student and um we didn't have many Believers MH uh we were about my wife another sister and a few others M very few those who are committed actually were just about three of us M and while in college I was invited to go and preach at our school capit high school mhm for one of my brothers we were within school had been taken there form five okay so he talk to the CEO chairman and the officials that I have a brother he can come and preach to us so I went there we had meetings over the weekend mhm and uh after the me the meeting several people believed quite a number of them believed and when they believed uh I baptized them and those who believed if you have heard of brother Mayo yeah he a a senior pastor in Nairobi one of the the churches in Nairobi he was the chairman mhm so he tells me uh we discuss with him is it a POS posibility to have a meeting here he tells me yes let me ask the the principal so he goes to the principal the principal gives him an okay mhm so he tells me you can now organize the meeting mhm so I go looking for food to feed the people and announcing the meeting but remember we don't have much money we are just students we have given 20 Shillings every month this the money we are going to put into the convention mhm so we take this money we buy food steps every month we buy food steps then I realized I don't have enough money by this time um I had we had connected somehow with brother Frank Frank award Frank award yes and Frank was coming to Kenya okay so I went to Nairobi to meet him okay when I went to Nairobi to meet him I found also there were other brothers okay I found brother guu brother Sila and I think other several Brothers I can't remember well yes so we meet brother Frank we talk to brother Frank I tell him what I wanted we thought he would give us a public address system he says I'm going to buy you right now you wait we go back to the to to the shops but it is evening of Saturday and I have to go go back to college okay so I tell him I can't wait because I'm a student and I took my off over the weekend I just have to go back to college MH so he's very disappointed and I go back to college so while I'm at college now this time for the camp the end of the year this is December mhm we are going to the December it's about October November and now I realize I don't have money enough money to to to you know to sponsor sponsor the meetings the meetings a friend of mine a Pentecostal comes and tells me my meeting is being sponsored I've good sponsors and I feel helpless because I not sponsor by meetings so what I did I was remaining with 20 Shing 20 shs then was a lot of money I went looked to myself in a room and opened that 20s before the Lord and I told him Lord you know my efforts and now this is all the money I have just tell me mhm so after I prayed not thinking about it I got to the post office I had a post office box I open it I get a good envelope out of it and when I open I receive a big check of 1,000 Shillings those days 1,000 Shillings was a lot of money and the letter the letter written by this brother says this money put where it is urgently need M I knew God had answered my prayers so I took the money and sank it in the convention into the man was enough to feed the convention and we remain with abundance and this meeting I didn't know who to invite so I contacted this brother in Nairobi was was called Guru gur yes I tell him might you be knowing any message preachers he tells me oh yeah I know some just let me call them don't bother about preachers yes so he calls brother Sila brother moo brother guondo and himself and they come for the convention yes and actually although we have we were having a church there were so many things we didn't know what to do like in my church for example a sister was leading the services and sisters were not limited to doing certain things I know of other churches where the preachers didn't know what they were doing even some like in Brother G his church he told me during L supper he was watching all the sisters and all the brothers their feet so when we came to this this this church this this convention this would be a very big Turning Point most of us yes because we now learn from one another mhm the the true cont context of the message MH some of the things we are doing wrong some for example some sisters thought by having their their dresses just at the knee it was long enough and they discover no it is not so they go get pieces of clothes to sew around their their addresses to make the address long and you would you would think that was our uniform then because you see somebody has a black address and has put a yellow piece of dress at the bottom and and and and these days the the the dresses are going are going back again above the knees that's funny because when we had the message our dresses were lengthened mhm yeah I think we have a problem with the with the sound with the battery for this one [Music] yeah so uh I was just saying that the these days it looks like uh the dresses of the sisters are going back again above the knee but yet then God like gave you the the understanding the Revelation that that that was not right yeah especially that convention uh sisters realiz maybe if you want to use this microphone sorry uh sisters realized that uh what they thought was was long dresses or not long dresses and therefore they got other pieces of clothes and had them soon around their dresses to make them long H and not only that some brothers had very long hair okay and they went to shave there were certain dressing in those days the B bottom and the the the platform shoes the Fashions of the time yeah the Fashions of the time those who had platform shoes they were ashamed the meetings went to look for people to go and cut the shoe to be flat I know people did that in the meet in the meetings I know people who went from the meeting they rent the pap to go and shave their hair some of them were having very big hair MH and actually the atmosphere in that meeting at capset was such an atmosphere such an anointing M the presence of God was so much mhm M and we left that meeting all of us changed amen and that's the meeting that transformed Us in Kenya amen yeah and and that makes me wonder what inspired you to call a convention at that time well I wouldn't understand because I mean if if it was the ability I didn't have it mhm if it was the money we didn't have the money I was a student brother may was just as a student M and so I I didn't I don't see but I believe God was in it and God was doing it yeah and so then also apart from all this uh Revelations that God brought and and you know helped the Believers also it was like a linking with many other ministers around the country all over the country so you got to know each other yeah actually for the first time we knew one another and we sat in that convention and talked and even because we didn't have know how to if somebody wanted to marry who who does the we had to go back to these people we are saying they they Fallen but this time we now decided we have to have our own get licensed mhm and conduct marriages so we asked brother Sila from ambassa to go and register the Attorney General so that he can conduct marriages I remember the first when I first believe the first one of the first messages I listened to was brother translation of Swahili messages of brother bam yes God bless his heart yes yeah and brother guandu also the ugandans uh uh know him well I think he's been here several several times yeah right so I think those are the names I can recognize in in the among the ministers that you were working with at the time yes and and so let's move on to the Uganda connection uh when was the first time that you came to Uganda and how was the message in Uganda at the time so we are looking at um you've started your church 1975 and uh this when did this meeting hold this 75 December 75 December yeah so then when was the first time that you came to Uganda now to come to Uganda we had been going on in Kenya and there was a brother who got a B in had to translate the messages to kiss okay so we got together several ministers uh within our area you you know brother Barnabas of the voice of God he was yeah we got together with Barnabas and brother muhanji and the others and we decided we shall be behind his brother and support the work he was doing m in translating the message books so he did quite a number of books and uh the what he was doing was not quality but at that time that was something and we he would translate the church ages I went and printed it in in K and we had a few copies and in the process we got connected to brother way MH brother way remember the one who died in the meeting of brother bam yes um I think there's a message where brother bam talks about him and he says is he okay is he okay and yeah yeah yeah so brother way writes a letter to tell us about brother in Uganda who are in in trouble and even one of them has written to to him asking him to sponsor maybe a poultry farm or a mat to business M to help the Brethren MH so brother way says I don't know who can go to Uganda to find out what is going on there MH and that was not a good time to come to ug that was 1981 mhm when the theot over turning second time mhm and the militia Ugandan milti tan militia had come in mhm and they were driven all the forces of obot up the Border mhm so I come in around that time and the country is tense I ask a brother called mutoni mut is a pastor now in Botella I asked him whether you can go together with you he agreed he was from the West that time so he accompass me we come to Toro we don't know where we are going mhm we just come we know that there is a a t g and there are some brothers there we have a name of that brother who wrote the letter so we come to the t g and then request to see this brother so we go to this brother's house and we talk with him we sit with him the situation was wasn't very good in this country mhm because even as we arrived in we F in the hands of this militia yeah and then they took us in where they were seated and the our guns are pointing at us and they trying to be friended to us we are so scared but after being with them for some time because we can't now hurry we can't tell them we want to go we just relaxed and trying to show them we are not afraid but after sometime they now ask us you can now go so they for somebody who has a there take these people there the other side so we are taking to we find these brothers and we talk with them we now get connection we get the picture of the what is going in the country there's a problem with the food there's a problem with supplies even clothing is a problem so we left with the report and um when we reach at the border this brother one of the brothers gave me an old cassette to to repair for him when we reach the Border we arrested without cassette and we are put in what was wrong with the cassette these people didn't seem to know what a cassette was H and they think we have a gadget that is dangerous ah some of those cassetes were not just normal cassetes yeah some of them were a bit complicated so they ask us what is this we tell this a cassette player Poli cassettes and we are Christians they say no You Are Spice so they lock Us in we plead and plead and plead and they bed for hours they even threaten to shoot us there H so after a long time somehow I spoke something and one say one of them said you have spoken good but these others are not speaking nicely so there was a a lady there was also a soldier she looked friendly now and said let let them just go let them just go so we were left to go and that marked the connection with Uganda from there and now WR Brothers uh way brother way I think uh talked to a brother in in Britain okay it was called brother stone m and they made some contributions and and U that same year toward the end of that same year that brother comes in with some some finances M so we buy clothing in Kenya and we come some money here so we came with the money and some clothing we gave clothing in Toro we went to uh that brother in Bali MH they forget his name there was this brother in Bal he's still there then is in ginger not there's another brother also Myra no that is more recent one H okay then we go to up to sorot brother's place M but to go to sorot it was challenging because you know that time these people are all over and they have roadblocks and if you are Kenyan they see you in form of money so we decide uh as we go to to uh to sorot we go to sorot I think we left brother Stone in tooro because we thought him being a white we would easily be identified mhm so we come back and we come here and the journey to this campal this road was so rough we went to Brother o Kell's house I've never met brother K but I went to that his house that time he wasn't in okay I think he had gone out of the country yes and went to his house and whever we went we bought some M we bought some food stuffs and de the bre with and we went back to to Uganda to Kenya mhm then these brothers were connected in too some of them crossed over to Kenya we found them jobs there mhm so from there now we began coming to Uganda for example now I began coming to Tor to PR there mhm and then in our coming many times I don't know which it was we now encountered a young man called odipo mhm has a young man in that Fellowship there was somebody there also and we saw brother him to have something we really encourage him to preach mhm and I met friends brother oio he would come to our meetings and most of these brothers came to our meetings brother I and the rest of them would cross over to our meetings okay and we had such a such a connection so Uganda and Kenya has been connected for a long time yeah and maybe for some who don't understand at that time I um I was just reading a little bit of what B bam was saying here in 1964 the message aible he said and now we are supposed to be going overseas over to Kenya and tanganika and Uganda in the tribes in there and they are having a little uprise now with the ma I can't get in as a missionary but I'm going to try to get in as a hunter go in and and and they're fixing up so um I don't you were you were we were you and I was discussing about this I do not know was this the year of the Mau Rebellion 1964 the ma Mau Rebellion was in the 50s was it was in the 50s yeah and around 1963 December M Kenya got independence okay so 64 Kenya was independent and the my M apprising was not much air mhm because uh actually we were we were independent and there wasn't much of that so by you see people I think people were reviewing what had been there yes yeah and so the the information even I'm sure did not use to travel as fast yeah at that time as it do today as it is today but even today we have a lot of fake news going around even then I believe even then what was being talked by the Europeans across MH was not the real picture so I think this gives me a mindset that even today you have a lot of missionary brothers or ministers fearing to come to Africa because of what they see on the news yeah and not only that even some ministers here in Africa they paint a very bad picture of us here in Africa to be able to win those Brothers abroad to give Aid mhm so somebody paints a very miserable picture we are starving we are starving the other time someone was saying oh we are eating dogs yeah and therefore you know when the brothers abroad hear that that's the picture they have which true yeah and one of the things that I I have learned is to trust God yes not to not to present the miserable picture of a Dying Africa Church yes and try to you know to play on the sympathy of the brothers abroad mhm because I don't think that's what God wants us to do so wrong information can hinder the flaw and extension of the Gospel that's right and you may think you are spreading the gospel with that sort of wrong wrong wrong information and God is not with you MH because when you use lies to cheat those Brothers actually you are robbing them mhm because those brothers are also straining yes so when you cheat them to Rob them for your own benefit and you think you are doing a service to God I think God is not with you and I think we'll talk a little more about that um but I I want to emphasize on this thing of wrong information because do you know who brother bam was talking to at the time in 196 in the 1960s who was his correspondent with the with East Africa there was a brother called Joseph Bose okay and Joseph Bose was in Mombasa okay yeah and he talked about even the message in those days there yes there there some people mson is mson b mson b yes mson B yes yeah so he was in Kenya and he was mostly in Mombasa area okay yeah um was he working for Kenya raes no the person who worked for Kenya raes was brother way oh that was brother way the one who was in the meetings of brother B brother way the one you were corresponding with yeah and he spoke good K okay very fluent okay yeah and so um these brothers do you think they might have misinformed brother bam about the situation in Africa in East Africa specifically at the time I wouldn't know exact because I wasn't mature enough to to know the current current current news that was on mhm but I think it wasn't as bad as it was in the 50s MH yeah because if he's speaking about the M rebellion in 1964 it had already happened it it was 52 53 around there mhm 51 52 53 around there but anyway um it also shows us a picture of the instability the security instability at the time yeah um which is what just actually relate to us when you first came to Uganda uh with the militias and and all that how it was difficult to come even with just a cassette player thinking you're a spy so it must have been difficult to maneuver around with the message at that time it was hard it was not easy yeah the transport was not what is on now M to travel from one place to another place you would take so long even within Kenya M just to move from one place to another place I remember I would move from my place to towards the border to bungoma M to areas where churches were and to get there sometimes you would spend a whole day mhm yeah and it wasn't very easy secondly we were not having anything we were so poor most of us MH so it was not easy to do things but we did so you've given us your background um how you started and um how you got to meet other brothers how you started you know making these meetings but still you were in rural Kenya at the time yeah so this makes me wonder uh if we talk about Ministry you know was it easy for you at the time to sustain your ministry um especially the r part of Kya well um I would say God gave us Grace for that day for that time like he was invited to go and preach somewhere and I didn't have the finances I just walked or it just rain yeah I just I just walk to the place if it is a even it took hours to walk I would walk to that place and preach if I saw I was getting later I would run I remember I ran more than 20 20 20 kilm to go and preach to a girl school and how old were you at the time I was about 1920 around 19 or 20 okay yeah so I I can I would rightly I would be right if I say that you used your strength oh yes for the purpose of the message at the time yeah and God gave us the grace but then how did you manage the ministry without money because we have a lot of young people today who think they can't serve God because they have no money and I'll will also bring it to you and to your attention that we have a lot of young ministers and when I say young I don't mean really really young like 20 or or 30 some may even be well over their 40s who have made it I should say uh the order of the day to write letters abroad begging for help in order to run the ministry back at home and to them they cannot be able to run the ministry without the white brothers or brothers from Asia wherever it is supporting them uh how were you able to do it at the time did you do the same thing that these brothers are doing because because we your ministry has been prosperous over the years even now you are still in a rural part of Kenya but last time I was there you've you know you've built a very huge church and I don't know do you have bazus giving you money because you need to advise us well serving God is a sacrifice if you're not ready to sacrifice don't don't go in the ministry mhm because uh from the time I believed I told you I got a th000 sh from Frank mhm and I think that's the only money I've got from abroad did you ask him for it no I told you what happened mhm and I believe God was in it mhm although L later I didn't agree with the Frank's approach to things M but I believe God used him that much mhm and then um I have always believed there are things of the message we need like books steps and other things that we don't have locally yes maybe today we may have a few locally but I believe that's what we needed from the brothers mhm uh the financial aspect like me I I went I I trained as a teacher MH I went to to train as a primary school teacher mhm the reason why I did that I believed I have enough time to serve God teaching as a primary school teacher I would have three months in a year free and I can make my three conventions in a year so I got I got a salary I fed my my family with it with and sometimes use that money when it was necessary do something for God mhm so the idea of asking for money from from abroad has never been in my my thoughts mhm and I have failed that's not right mhm yeah so um I worked and preached I worked as a teacher for 30 years I worked as a teacher for 30 years as well as I pastored the church uh past when I came down to kosi and I keep going back to this because there's something I want my people My Generation to understand yes I've you've had me come over to kosi several times yes and uh and I've also brought over a few Brothers over the years to come and see how God has worked among you and among your people um we we've noticed like I said I noted previously that by by God's grace you've been able to build a church yes and I saw the first church before you de demolished it and another First Church before the other one that you demolished so the other one was um I think um do they call it mud mud Beauty was was it built out of mud it was brick but brick poorly made uhuh like okay so that thata like can I say traditional one the very first one I think was sitting about 20 30 people around 50 people around 50 people okay and then you left that on and then you build another one sizable building yes I think we're sitting about 300 in it and now you have it's unfortunate I would not prepare these uh pictures for the people but um now you have a new building uh which is I was given an opportunity to come and be there at the dedication and we had the service dedication service um this seats I don't know more than 500 around 600 around 600 yes so and it's very beautiful I mean when you arrive there you think wait where am I I mean in am I in Nairobi oh oh you know actually how the question is how are you able to do that in a rural part of Kenya without white people powering money into your ministry because some people we have a group of young ministers who think that's the only way to go uh and you can't convince them otherwise so can you convince us that it is possible well it is possible because it has happened yes um as I've told you we never have asked for money from abroad and I believed I believe that's the way we have done things we it's not that we are rich m M but we sacrifice M the first church we build a small Church M we just donated pledges in the church we donate and build the church first we donated we pledged bu bought the plot M we pled build the small church then we we thought this church was small because we now are having our meetings there mhm so we build the bigger Church you saw the first bigger Church mhm and soon it was not enough yes and the Brethren felt why can't we extend this church actually the idea was we extend the other Church MH but when I put the case before the church the people refused they said we build another church yes and um the the plan they brought was too big I told them no so what we did with the elders we worked a plan that that was what is now would save on space and will sit more people and that's how he brought in the idea of the baron mhm but where is the money but all we did was we believed God and we started we didn't have money we didn't have an account for the church MH we got the little money we got if it's for cement we put in cement if it's for the the the the Brick the blocks we brought the blocks and we started building just like that and I had the report I think was it brother Moses who was in charge of the building committe Moses been Char of building ah man that young man did a spectacular work I mean I had report he spent all his time there for the mans that we are building I I I just felt that if and we didn't pay him by the way he wasn't even paid that is sacrifice That's What I Call sacrifice and by the way the all these people that the pastor is saying that they sacrific to do that work to build that work God has blessed them some of you who have been with us to kosi you've seen the people are living in a rural area but when you come to the meetings I mean the parking is full the parking is full these people are blessed financially they are blessed spiritually and I believe that that's the way to go even for Our Generation to sacrifice sacrifice these days when you you I mean in message churches I don't know where that it's only here in Uganda people don't want to hear the pastor talking about money talking about contributions talking about pledges when you do I mean like for instance here at um days of the voice Fellowship we have um we've had some pledges going over some time now yes and we're trying to collect funds to uh buy our church plot it's about 200 million ugana Shillings and we we we've been collecting that over time and so it like was became a little bit difficult so what we decided to do you know it just came to me as an inspiration that I should have the church divided into several groups we have now seven groups and each group collects a certain amount of money and then we bring it all together and we announce it to the church every Sunday morning so um and it is working I believe it is working cuz we are progressing we are going at the right direction currently we have about 67 million out of the 200 million and our church is not that big as you can see yeah so but um recently I heard that there's a certain person who visited from another church and had the collections we were making and and and was like no this church is a very good church but it is money-minded well you can't run the church without money mhm and what I can say my people have sacrificed to bring the church to where it is it is a sacrif rice some people have sacrificed heavily I don't want to mention names M there are people when there's a project in the church they take it personal mhm they take it personal and do it personally mhm and they are my strength M my church is my strength MH those people support me so seriously mhm they stand with me on every project and they they make me feel very humble that reminds me of the testimony that brother bham gave about that um poor Widow who was giving her little nickos yes and he didn't want to take it yeah that's yeah because he felt that these people don't have you know they are poor people and until until you know brother was it this brother who corrected him yeah that is it it was a Deon uh yeah uh you know this brother God had blessed him and you know he s Bri or something like that yeah and so turn turns out that brother banam also teaches and he asserts it is how important it is for the people to support their Pastor to support their the the labors of the ministry uh because support is not going to come from outside the church well God can do that over maybe sometimes but it must come from the people to support their own work yeah just you know brother says who is a church member explains a church member and a church member is not just a person who comes to sing in the church and goes away come to say aen goes away no is a man or woman that comes to church he supports that church with his finances through tithing and offerings he supports that church with his presence and with his prayers so we cannot exclude and I believe I believe I believe even he said if you don't if you don't pay tithe in the church for example you have no right to vote in that church you're not a member of that church so the support of the church financially is very important and what I've done I've taught my people and they know it and they support the church I I only avoid extremes I don't want to put them extremes where they always you know on big projects every time time yes I I sort of regulate yes sometimes I I differ with them they they themselves want it I tell you no because I H they want to overburden them yeah overburden them yes just to do what they can and if one project I put on them we work on it yes and they have been wonderful yes they have supported me they actually the strength of my Ministry M yeah how I wish our generation can learn this not only those who are hearing me at this time but even those who will hear this over the next years um I just wish I had the pictures to show you on on what Pastor vas Minister has been able to accomplish with the people like he said supporting that work supporting locally I mean I had an opportunity of being with one of your sons in the Lord uh brother Timothy yes and uh I I I could see that I mean I I did not need to whatever project we had at the time in Ethiopia cuz um um we met him a deacon um inis Ababa when I was still a pastor there and he was very supportive yeah I could see that he learned from the best yeah so I think that this is something that we can learn and I thought it was something very important to highlight in this interview for uh for Our Generation to learn from that so what would you consider uh would be the right approach to Ministry in which way well um we we yester yesterday um I think you preached to us a very wonderful service yes and you spoke about the bearing uh a minister can be a minister but with a wrong bearing oh yes yes um if you could please expound on that uh uh the ministry has has good many aspects and it depends on why why you in the ministry MH because I know there are people in the ministry to make to make themselves money mhm uh they can't sacrifice anything yeah like if you see the time we started we didn't have anything yeah and we didn't start ministering because we we needed money I didn't take tithe in the church for many years mhm so many years I preach without taking tithes MH and when I started taking tithes it was very late most of that tithe was plowed back in the ministry MH so if your ambition is money Minister goes after money goes go God gets away mhm I think that St me is the in one of the life story he says mhm so if the motive is money mhm that preacher lost it mhm if that that preacher the motive is riches then that man is already finished before he starts mhm and some people want to preach because they they think being a preacher is something that gives them status mhm and they being called a minister of the of the message makes them look look great mhm and those are wrong motives so if you have those motives that's why it is very easy for you to go away into wrong Doctrine mhm because your motives are not right exactly when you have wrong motives you will never end right mhm but if God has called you and God has put the burden of the church into your heart mhm this is a man who would spend time looking in the Bible in the message to know what he's going to say is what it is true and what will benefit the people because I believe preaching the message is not only reciting whatam says I believe it's getting the spirit of the message MH and I believe that's where you can get the right bearing if you can get the spirit of the Prophet amen get what the you know John said I was in the spirit of the Lord's day and if you can get if a minister can get in the spirit you know there is one thing just to speak things that you are not in the spirit so if the minister can get the spirit get the Revelation get himself in that atmosphere where the Holy Ghost can get him then you have somebody who can help you amen yeah so it goes to the motive why someone is entering into the ministry wonderful mhm yeah and I believe if we censored ourself along those lines some of us would rather sit down M and give up yeah yeah some people make uh or look at ministry as a way of enriching themselves as a way of having soft life which is unfortunate because you realize sometimes in our churches like the rural churches you find even the pastor sometimes you have to to give the people yeah you have to take care of them that happens a lot even yeah some of them are sick and they can't go to hospital you have to you know so if you went in because you want to be rich actually I noticed in Africa yeah most pastors are like fathers to their congregation is it yeah so if is the motive of getting rich then you go to the wrong motive and I believe in spiritually you're not correct M you're not correctly wired spiritually yeah I love the way you phrased it you're not correctly wired spiritually yeah if your your motive is money and your motive is riches to drive a big car yes to do this yes I think you are not correctly wired spiritually yeah there's a problem there there's a problem there my my my and then you see also you touch that part of uh because because of the wrong motive you you find them also going into wrong Doctrine Doctrine that's right um someone can easily change their Doctrine simply because there is money somewhere yeah and this what we have seen some of the doctrines that come especially from outside they are sponsored by people of money M and we have seen our brothers change camps from one group to another one M they eating money from this group then they they see this group as come as more money you find they are there MH when that one seems to go down there's another group that has come with money they are there they seem to smell where money is yeah and if a preacher does that that's not much you going to put your life into his hands yeah I would rather have somebody that has nothing amen but has the conviction and has the revelation of the message and dedicated the message amen and he's ready to stand and die for amen then have somebody that looks wonderful wonderful words speaking Mysteries but he goes around following any type of win because of money MH I I think that would be terrible uh that's very good C and we appreciate that um I think if you are listening in and you're a minister you have to check your motives the motives why it why is it that you are getting into the ministry um is it for fame is it for money is it for something else you must have as we've heard it in his own words you must have a right conviction a right conviction of why you are getting into the ministry well we are getting almost to our close but before we do there a few more things that I would like you to comment on speaking of wrong doctrines there are many that we can be able to talk about certainly starting the ministry 1975 you've seen a lot of Winds of camps and ideologies within the message but there's one that I would like you to specific specifically address being that you when you first started out actually you're coming to the message started on a tape listening to a tape yeah there are those who uh say that pastors should sit down preachers should sit down we should only play the tape for the people play the tape on on on weddings play the tape on Outreach play the tape in churches and the work of the right minister is to play the tape for the people how did you when you first started out what was your approach to that and and and what would you advise Our Generation today when we started out we didn't have that we had tips of course we had tips from the brothers abroad we listen to the tips but we had preaching MH and I I can tell you thatth from my my experience sometimes the people listen to the tips and they don't get the what is in the tips H but the preacher comes in and preaches the same message and explain and expounding on what will say and people say we didn't see it I can now understand it better yeah so if we go the approach of the preacher should sit down and the tap should be everything it means we'll be contrary to the message because brother says um he quotes Ephesians 41 that when he ascended on high he gave gifts unto men some he gave prophets Apostles evangelist teachers pastors and he says this was for the edification of the church and the for Unity of the faith so if we get these people sit down and they're doing nothing it means that part of the scriptures we are putting it down yeah number two brother says the bride will have a Ministry and he tells us that the ministry is a five-fold Ministry yes when when Jesus was on Earth all the God had dwelt in him and the ministry was in his hands but on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came upon the disciples the ministry expounded to many other vessels we know when was here the message was in his hands but that was a prophet that where the word came to the prophet but after he's going God would raise up men who will cut out the ministry and that would be within the fivefold ministry and brother said if you are called to preach preach yeah if you are called to teach teaching so how do you preach when you are playing the tap yeah so the thing is it's good stand between the between the lines between the lines the TS should be listened to yes the preacher should preach yes the book should be read and the preacher should preach double amen so the whole thing should be there the TS should be listened to and the preachers to preach fire mhm and let the people get what the TS say the preacher get what the the inspiration in the tips and they preach the message amen yeah that's what I believe and if you say no tips you are wrong if you say no preachers you are wrong yes but the the the right thing is to have both of them together amen yeah so people should read the message listen to the tapes but also should come under the preaching of their Pastor in fact because of this because of that Doctrine some people don't go called Church yeah and that's wrong because says you should have a church which you call your home Church MH where You' go and pay your tith exactly and support support support the work of God Amen so when you sit at home and say you in the message you are breaking the message because you don't have a church and you are not supporting any any Ministry by your ti mhm so those who say they are streaming or they are listening to at home they may think they're doing something very spiritual but they are in error mhm yeah it's very unfortunate and also these Ministries have roles the pastor like I said yesterday the pastor is like a nurse yes you need a nurse in your life a spiritual nurse so when you take a TP a t cannnot nurse you I have seen people use the tape for for for what for wedding or dedicating of children that is to me that's Catholicism yeah where you use the dead Saints to pray for the people we ask to pray for the people and we should not make brother Branham one of the Catholic saints God gave Ministries and he said you have a pastor yes and ask your your pastor with the questions yes so I would believe if we take the message take it as it is yes yeah and the danger is we may do that and Elevate to an idol yeah which is not good also yeah yeah because you see brother bham um is the a messenger pointing us to Christ not to himself yeah so we are not pointing people to brother Branham we are pointing people to the Christ that he pointed us to that's a very major point because brother branham's Ministry is a replay of John's Ministry yeah and when John say said Behold the Lamb of God mhm those disciples who are with him they followed who Jesus MH they went to Jesus so John pointed them to Jesus and they followed Jesus brother Bram points us to Jesus and we must follow Jesus Jesus yeah so uh our listeners we are about to come to a close um and so I'll ask the pastor maybe one or two more questions and then he will give his final remarks and then we will bring it to a close but before we do I'd like to let you know if you have any question and you listening in and you'd like to ask the pastor please write it on the comment section send send in your questions especially about the things he's been talking about maybe something he say that you would like him to throw more light on or something else that he did not talk about that you would like him to talk about please send it in and then we'll read it for him shortly and if you're here as well and you have a question you just raise up your hand and uh will let you ask your question uh one more thing about um in the brother banam says that I mean no one should stand behind a pull pit behind the sacred desk if they are not filled with the Holy Spirit or if they've not had that experience and you've told us about your experience way back in the 70s I'm sure you've had more experiences since then uh what would you say to someone who sincerely believes this message but has never had an experience and he actually claims or she claims I'm fine because I believe shouldn't every believer be um baptized into the Holy Ghost and have an experience thereof I believe brother bam says it's compelling it's compelling that every person has an experience with God and it's unfortunate because of the wrong approach the message and the way it was taught that some people have a slud belief about the Holy Ghost so that today when you talk about the Holy Ghost people see you are Pentecostal MH but you see every true Christian and every true uh Bible preacher there is no way you preach salvation and preach experience with god without preaching the baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost yeah and there is no way as a preacher you can have the depth of God without having the baptis of the Holy Spirit and I don't know what has happened because it looks like either we are refusing it bluntly or is a false anointing I don't know because every message I play of brother Bram he's talking about people being filled with the Holy Ghost amen I was playing in my church one of the TS where was encouraging people to receive the Holy Ghost after he preached and he would tell people surrender surrender to God Just Surrender Your Life surrender now and then the Holly ghost fell in the in in the meeting and fell on on four people and says there it is you can see the pill fire there he telling brother shakarian said you see there it is there it is she has received it and that sister begins to scream the next person the same the next person the same and he says 1 2 3 4 have received it h so now when you come to our preachers today and especially in my country I don't know what the problem is H because even a common sense somebody reading with a common sense and listening with the common sense there is no way you can rub out that it is there deps and you run it right from 40s to the time the death of brother 6 65 so to me it is mandatory mhm and if you a preacher without the Holy Ghost you are doing yourself at the service mhm yeah if you want God to touch you to lead you and show you exactly what is the riches of his glory amen you need the Holy Ghost amen yeah amen um and that I've been asked by many um and I'm sure it would be very helpful coming from an elder such as yourself how someone out there might want to know or someone who will listen to this later on how can I receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit um from my own experience and from what I seen the message total repentance you will repent your sins yeah God is obligation to give you the Holy Ghost yeah you don't have to do anything you simply clean your heart confess your sins sincerely and honestly and be open to go and surrender to God just like I've said brother say surrender and don't don't look to receive the Holy Ghost like so and so or don't imagine that when I get I must do this you don't know what God will do Just Surrender and let God fill you the the way he wants amen the way he did to me he may not do the same to you he may do it his own way so the best thing is total repentance and a surrendering her to God having faith that this is your promise God say it gave it to you it is your promise and God will give it to you so so if someone keeps one leg one feet in the world one feet in Christ it is impossible that is why many people don't get the Holy Ghost yeah because today they're praying for the Holy Ghost tomorrow they in the world they come you are preaching about the Holy Ghost they want the Holy Ghost they go outside here they go out of the Holy Ghost so it's on and off on and off on and off and some decide to then settle in there say oh I think God doesn't want to fill me with the Holy Spirit yeah I'm I'm in the sleeping bride and if you're in the sleeping bride you should not be in the church by the way if you are sleeping bride you should be the Pentecostal yeah but you exposed the message here yeah and this is where the promise is being dished have your portion yeah amen amen that can never be overemphasized I wish you would talk more about this I mean I was just beginning to feel so good I'm sure there's much more that can be said about this quite a lot about the BT B of the Holy Ghost is quite a lot a lot yes and the examples in the message are several several you look at people how they they receive the holy ghost in the message leave alone the Bible because you know when you say the Bible they tell you we are not in the book of Acts and yet we are being destroyed the book of Acts you see restoration is not having a new thing I have heard people say in this message we are higher than higher than the book of Acts if you are higher than the book of Acts then you are not preaching restoration MH because restoration is bringing us bringing us back the book of Acts amen and making this word live in our day like it live then so if you say you have something higher than what Paul had then I doubt you m you seem to have gone beyond the limits of God yeah now Pastor batita there is one more question I think this will be maybe the last or the second last amount I don't know I usually ask it to elders and um I do not know how it will come across to you I'm sure you are not prepared for it but I have to ask it what was or what is your greatest regret since you came into the ministry something that you did uh that you you you you can you can feel at Liberty to share with the younger generation and say Here's the mistake that I did and I pray that you never do the same H I've made many mistakes very many very many um one of the things I regret now mhm when when you pick this message I personally I look to the message from legalistic point mhm where you are not doing right you are not this and I think we had many people MH so that um we didn't preach the message with Grace MH some of the problems we have is the way we handled the message in the beginning mhm it's not our fault but because we didn't have a pastor MH we didn't have somebody leading us mhm it was we looking in the books and also you did not have the full message full message and the full knowledge of the message yeah but where I am now if I'm given a second time there are people we communicated I should not excommunicate yeah there are people you know we send away from church and I would not send them away today mhm yeah MH the the the way we presented this message mhm and in a legalistic way mhm that was not right MH yeah and and that is very good for our younger ministers to know that this message is a message of Grace and one thing Pastor batita I did not expect you to say this on the interview because I know you've you've said that to me before uh when I was visiting you with you but uh one thing that you've continued to impact me with is the your humility your ability to come out and say well I was wrong with that I ought not to have done that and I realize there also a very big weakness in the ministry among the ministers that you know he will do something which will hurt the people but he cannot be able to own up and say I ought not to have done that that was wrong but the greatest preacher is one that can say I'm wrong yeah because we are we not super Supernatural M we are human beings M sometimes you can preach an idea and sometimes the idea is not right yeah and sometimes we find is not right MH and you should come back and say I think here I was not I was not right yeah so the problem is today we have ministers who feel they are right and they're holy and everything they say is from the presence of God and it cannot be challenged yeah it cannot be challenged which is wrong which is wrong praise the Lord I I I think that that that really is so impacting it is so impacting and so um the many who would even excommunicate some people simply because they're not part of their Camp which is not right and that's that's a spirit of that I've really been grieving about where because I disagree with you I can't have you in my company MH because I disagree with you I should not have so and so come come to see you MH that is a bad approach and that's a bad spirit and others even help other ministers help other ministers hate other ministers on their behalf that is true which is wrong it should never be encouraged it's an evil spirit and that's what brother W wers about yeah yeah you are my brother whatever you do and you have done a mistake I should look at your mistake as you didn't mean it mhm Satan has done it MH our biggest enemy is the devil yes yeah we are fighting the devil MH and so if the devil uses you to do something I should not really put it on you m yeah it's the devil doing it exactly yeah well I think we are coming to a close here and um I'm going to ask the pastor to say a few um his last remarks uh whatever it is that is on his heart his admonition to the young people to the uh young Min SS uh but before that I still give a chance to anyone who has um something that he would like the pastor to speak about um as you all know Pastor vti has now been ministering uh preaching this message for 50 years it's amazing 51 51 now yeah 51 51 years goodness I'm not even 4 yet so we really thank God to have to to to have an opportunity to sit down with you here today on the bench It's a grand grand opportunity and we couldn't um in any way take it for granted we so much appreciate your time that you have um uh taken to come and be with us here this is not for you it is for us it is for Our Generation it is for the generation after and so if you have anything that you would like which I know you do uh to maybe look to towards this camera and and say to to our listeners please what I would say this message is true I have lived with it it has been my support I have been through many occasions in very many difficult situations this message has proved to be alive um I have had spectacular healings in my life and it's because of this message because I know if I was not a beli of this message I will not be alive today I remember in the ' 80s I got a kidney problem that was so serious and I should have died when I was sent for the X-rays I pleed with God I said God if you can't heal me now it will be hard for me to be healed later on because my faith to climb to a place where I can be healed would be heard I just ask you when I go to the table of xray do something and let that man when he read the the what he has been xray find nothing wrong and when I went to the X-ray table they did the X-ray and the man was very sympathetic with me but when he went to read he looked and it's surprising he told me what is wrong there's nothing wrong you okay and when he said that I had something like a shock pass through my body and that pain went and I got healed completely I later on I went to school that one one morning after that I taught in the class and then went to my car to take a cup of tea and the devil told me you are just imagining you are sick and I said sure I don't think I was sick and that pain came back right there I said oh God forgive me forgive me for doubting I know you healed me and the pain went I had other complications I've had psoriasis psoriasis aate skin problem and my skin would would disintegrate in a very short time it was all eaten up purches and I live that problem for long but one day I woke up and told my wife it is over I'm I'm not going to have it anymore I believe what brother Abraham said and I confess healing and the thing went we I have read I have told you about my eyes went off yeah and I could not see and I want whoever is listening and is sick to believe that God is able to do it amen amen I could not see I went to class to teach and the children would make fun of me because I'm not seeing I would meet people on the way and they would look at me and they pass but God did a miracle one day one time I was in school my sister she's now diseased came with a husband in a car took the key of the car and gave me told me drive this car I said I can't drive you know he said I've told you drive it so I got the car started to drive and as we went I saw I can see to my amazement the amazement of people are looking and from that time God has help me I'm able to drive at least I'm able to read my Bible to read the message and before you couldn't read the Bible you couldn't drive actually by the time the time uh the I went off even preparing to preach was quite a labor and when I wrote I wrote very big things to be able to read if I show show you my nodes they big big letters so that I can read them struggling sometimes I had a hand lens to look at what I was writing and reading but God is good amen the doctor told me you will not see again don't even come you're going blind but I'm I'm I'm praising the Lord today 24 years after I'm still able to see amen amen uh recently you heard that I got a osed with the cancer and uh I I took a lot of inspiration from brother Spencer if you have listened to brother Spencer I'm a good listener to brother Spencer yes brother Ron Spencer has a wonderful test spener and when this happened to me I remember one of the statements he met the devil likes to use fear in cancer so I said if that be it I will not fear so when the doctor tells me you have cancer I said Doctor uh if I have cancer it's okay I'm not scared because I know if I fear the SAT will take advantage but I know one thing God is able to heal me amen and if he doesn't heal me and my time has come to go I'm willing to go and um I want to thank the brother all over the country and all over the the Eastern Africa place all over they were praying for me remember when you were having meetings here yes with brother Timothy I sent a request yes and God has been gracious that thing God to get away amen amen uh the last time I took my PSA it was 0.4 H and it was 30 amen I thank God so much amen amen so I want to encourage en everybody this message is working this message is able to save this message is able to heal amen this message is able to do great things if I would give my testimony to would take time and I don't think time allows it but for the young people you are not you are not wrong or you are not disadvantaged having this mess mhm because it works it works for 50 years it has worked amen and I know it still will work amen God bless you amen thank you so much would you please um pray for those with needs I think this is a very good ending there might be someone who is sick could be among the things that you mentioned that you had and God delivered you from them could be something else we'll just have a moment and and um then you pray over those uh shall we have sister charity where's sister Charity she around can we have the piano and and uh then we can maybe just have you pray over those needs yeah yeah yeah whatever needs is there I know God

side took a stone and threw it on the on the snake on my leg good Lord and I coil and went back the the water I think that's not just an accident M I think that's God yeah if he can do that I believe
