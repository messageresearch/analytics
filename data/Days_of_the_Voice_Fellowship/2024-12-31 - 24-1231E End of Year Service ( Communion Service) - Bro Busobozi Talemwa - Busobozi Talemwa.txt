bless us in every season you begin something new oh I believe there is something new today Lord I'm expecting I am under great expectation I pray that you bless everyone even now as we approaching the communion service I ask that you will come and bless us in Jesus name amen you may be seated for just a moment I'm so happy to see different ones coming uh to be in the house of the Lord turn to your neighbor and tell them welcome to the house of the Lord amen is there anyone visiting us for the first time if you can lift up your hands so we can see you if you're here for the first time let us clap our hands for our brother there God bless you anybody else okay over here there's a sister and another sister there God bless you so much you are all welcome today amen so we are so happy to be in the house of the Lord this 31 one season is going and another season is beginning amen um shall we turn to our Bibles we are going to share something little as we are headed for [Music] communion after that we have a very wonderful night today because we have many brothers uh um going to minister to us and I don't know about you but I am under great expectation this night can I request the brothers sisters Seated on the other row to please come and join these other rows we have many empty seats this side if you you pleas don't mind that is thank you wonderful avoid being behind a pillar because I love preaching to people that I see all right amen so we can stand on our feet we going to go to the book of Isaiah chapter [Music] 53 amen we are beginning from verses 1 to vers 7 everybody there if you there say amen who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed y for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form no cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we shall we should be desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has born our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was breathed for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed [Music] all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth amen let us pray Our Kind Heavenly Father we want to surrender ourselves to to you this this evening Lord this is a s moment because we want to remember what you did because of us we were born in sin all of us in sin but your grace found us because because of you we are alive because of you we are saved today no one can boast because of their works but because of your work we are so happy we are so happy in Jesus we can be able to say out loud today we are redeemed I am redeemed both with a price thank you Jesus for your love thank you Jesus for your grace thank you Father for dying on the cross for accepting to be beaten and to go through the pain and the suffering and the agony all because of me I am so thankful Lord I give praise honor and glory to your holy name in Jesus name amen you may be seated God bless you hallelujah amen how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord today I've seen there are many people here who do not have H Bibles when I'm reading they folding their arms uh I think in this ch we do not allow that we believe that every Christian should own a Bible but if you are not a Christian and you're just visiting us that is okay you you can be like that for a week or two after you become a Christian then you have to own a yeah but if you're a Christian and you don't have a Bible it is not right so if you are near someone who has no Bible tell them it is not right make it a point this year to find a Bible if you are so poor you cannot buy one we will help you to have one but everyone must have a Bible I I expected bigger amens amen um I do not know how to get into this I'm just going to speak for about 25 minutes and then uh we shall go into uh food uh food washing and communion um you know communion is a very is a part of our Christian faith how many have ever been a part of communion or how many have never okay I I see several hands go up I wish I knew that you were so many I would have taken a teaching on [Music] communion uh maybe that means I should take one of these one of these services in the coming year I should take a service on that just to teach on on communion but generally speaking communion there are three ordinances three ordinances that that we were left or told to do one of them is water baptism I continue these three ordinances do not serve us none of them serve us but we do it because we are saved only the saved must do those three if you are still trying to get to know about it about salvation then you can wait to do them but only the saved are the ones who do or participate in those three ordinances it is for the church for the Believers those who have confessed Christ and have believed him the first ordinance that must be done by every believer these three are a must if you don't do them it is an indication you are not a Believer if you refuse to be a part of them even if you were a part of the church it shows you are not a Believer the very first is water baptism now water baptism is an is an ordinance of the Christian Church everyone that believes Jesus Christ as their savior the very first thing they must do is they must be baptized in much water not by sprinkling not by powering but by immersion deeping bar in much water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in father son Holy Spirit but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that is the name above all names that is the name whereby we can be saved so every believer who has the gospel and believed with their hearts confess with their mouth they must be baptized in much water in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ does water bapti anyone no what a baptism is done by those who are saved how many understood that so after believing then you get baptized what a baptism doesn't make you a Believer you do it because you have believed amen why it is a symbol of the burial and Resurrection with of Jesus with Jesus Christ if you believe that Jesus died was buried and resurrected you do it in symbolic form to show his death resurrection and to show that you are identified with him that because you have been identified in his death and burial you've died to the world and you bued in water and then when you come up it's a symbol you will come up with him like he rose from the dead you will also rise again in the resurrection of the saints that is which we call the Rapture of the church so that's the first ordinance so every believer must do that the moment you believe that's the first thing you do the second thing that we we have been taught by Jesus to continue doing is to take of the bread which we call um um um which we call generally we call communion to take the bread this is uned bread you know in the Jew Jewish culture they used to call it uned bread in Uganda we call it there is no there is other there is no there is no anything what else do we there is no salt there is no cooking [Music] oil that is just burn on both sides you don't even understand it it looks weird it is like a scalp even if you put it in the mouth sounds weird when you look at it it looks beaten up looks bad it looks as if it has been beaten up it has broken up because it signifies the body of Christ so we eat that bread in remembrance of the body that Jesus Christ gave because we were guilty and um that's what I want to talk about today because I was guilty and then we take the wine which you know symbolizes um the many things we can talk about simulation of Revelation symbolizes the Holy Spirit symbolizes the many things we can talk about there symbolizes the blood praise the name of the Lord the blood of Jesus will never lose its power amen it increases in power it cannot lose its power that's why in wine we do not take grape juice we don't take a ju is the issue [Music] here it's the fruit of the Vine no just get this cuz the people will get confused as well it is a fruit of the vine it is grape it is from The Grapes it is from The Grapes I know you are Ugandan so you don't understand grapes because we don't grow grapes here but grapes is what they make wine from yes yes yes and um so it can you know you can take those grapes and you can make a ju out of them you see that is n it is called non alcoholic they sell it here even in shops they call grape juice it looks reddish but it is a non-alcoholic drink but you see wine you see wine is um um is is fermented fermented so so yes so the ju goes bitter and sour and it goes bad but the wine the longer it stays the more powerful it becom so that's the wine we take actually if you take much of it you get drunk but you see the reason we take that is because it symbolizes the power of the blood it symbolizes the power of the spirit it shall never lose its power the more the more it stays the more powerful it is and um we will read a few scriptures on it later just a few minutes to come so and then we also do feet washing so we do feet washing um of one another Jesus did that for the disciples and um you know at one time Peter said no don't wash my feet because you are my Lord he said okay if I don't wash your feet you are not a part of me so then Jesus um Peter said ah in that case wash also my head and my whole body you know he repented quickly he said if I can't be a part of you just wash me and wash all my body but you see the point here is we should wash another one another's feet being our Lord he humbled himself and washed the disciples feet as our example of humility of love and you know he did it and he told us to do the same and since that time Believers have been doing it and we are going to do it today even if your brother's feet has even if he came you know walking on feet that is the one you should choose come you know the the in the in the days of the Jews washing one someone's feet was a work of the Lonely People the poor you know when someone comes to your house you take him and wash his feet so there were those servants who were at the G washing their people's feet especially those digitar respected guests and then they would enter in when they are now clean it's a sign of showing respect love someone is received you remember when Jesus visited that house he used feet was not watched and he sat in a corner and you know that woman came and wash Jesus's feet with her own tears praise the name of the Lord oh my there's much we can talk about I think I'll take services on each of those subjects so we can understand the you know the significance of those things praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah but today I just want to take a few moments to talk about that subject just that those words because I was guilty he is despised and rejected of men there is no beauty that we should desire him a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we he and we heed as it were our from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs he has CED our sorrows if you have Sorrows here today I want to say Jesus cared your Sorrows you should not go with your sorrow to another year he has carried your sorrow he has borne your griefs and yet they did not esteem him he was smitten he was afflicted of God and he says he was wounded for our transgressions he was breathed for our iniquities and with his stripes we are healed as you are taking communion today you are going to be healed I want you to have faith for any sickness you have you are going to be healed why because by his strikes we are healed not we shall be healed we are healed in the message the context the cont he says this CER bread it is made by Christians not everyone can come and make this bread it is made by Holy Ghost fi Christians it is unlived bread and if you will notice it when you place it in your mouth it's very rugged to be bitter it is wrinkled and broken it is mingled that means the broken mangled body of our Lord Jesus imagine Jesus was Guiltless but he carried our guil he was sinless cared our sin let me ask you a question when we talk about Grace I want us to understand the importance of grace many many people we even today we still think the works of the works we are going to do will qualify us to go to heaven right you're going to dress well and because of that you will go you are going to live right and because of that you will go you are going to talk right and because of that you go but I want you tonight to understand there is no amount of works you can do that can buy you salvation no amount of works we do that can buy us eternal life that is why we should quit trying to work our own Works pay attention to what I'm saying and understand we should quit trying to do why is Christianity very hard why does it seem like a burden to many because we are trying our best to live right let me tell you there was once a couple who lived without the devil sat was not known to them Temptation was not known to them they were perfect they were not born in sin they were spoken out of the mouth of God they were created in the image of God and that was Adam and Eve but they fell so what makes you think that you can try to do something to be better than Adam and there is no amount of works that you can try to do that can make you righteous the Bible says our works of righteous as filthy rocks before God whatever you try to do in your own power by trying now the year is ending many are going to say from today I am no longer going to do this you see what did you do there you committed to try and be good many of you I'm going to say now from today I am no longer going to contact these people you even change your number you delete those contacts you block them and you start a new le you open a new page you say I'm a new man now in this 2025 I'm a new person now but before even the first day of 2025 ends you realize you go back to all those things you made up your mind you will you will stop how many understand what I'm trying to talk about yes many times it has not worked why because we are trusting in our works are trusting in our abilities but you have to come to a place and understand you works and your abilities will always fail you no man has ever passed by his words no one in this Bible that we have ever read of that has passed by his words all have failed the Bible says all have SE all have sinen and have come short of the glory of God no one righteous no not one not one all of you including myself every one of us is a failure by default there are no amount of works we can do that can buy us salvation even a man who was very good at keeping the law you know he came to Jesus and he told him good Master what must I do to be saved he thought it's all about what because the laws of Moses told him many many works the Ten Commandments and everything see imagine that man was righteous as far as are concerned better than all of us here how many here can say since I was born I've never lied that man was better than all of you he had never lied he had never stolen he had never CED never doubt he had never all those Ten Commandments he kept them Jesus answered him he said what you want to know what you can do oh go and do the The Ten Commandments and he mentioned all of them and the man said Jesus I have done all of them since I was a child Jesus looked at him and he said you you said the correct thing Jesus accepted that this man was saying the truth he was perfect as far as the laws were concerned he was his Works were 100% but still he felt there was something Laing he wanted to know what can he do more than the Lo he had done well but Jesus told him I will now tell you there is one more thing that you must do one more thing you must do that you missed out the man said what is it he said to him go sell everything you have sell everything you have tell your neighbor sell everything you have sell everything you have oh come on tell your neighbor one more time sell everything you have that is what we need to do sell everything you have sell all your malice sell all your pride sell all your self rightousness sell all your Works give up your life die to the world all you think is important to you to come to a place where you see it as nothing where you Lift Jesus Higher Than Anything where you come to a place and say because I was guilty Jesus died that is the place where every believer must and said because I was guilty I have no good work in me I'm selling everything now let me become a fool for Christ let me be abused for Christ until we come to that place where we accept to become a fool for Christ we we get obsessed Christ when it come to worship if it is for Christ you do it like it is your only business you do it is heart amen whether you are preaching you are not preaching fearfully you are preaching with boldness I'm saying whatever you are doing be singing or playing an instrument I mean this should be your resolution this year sell everything give up even your friends and give up even the world give up the of you have to give up that feeling for Jesus I can do anything for Jesus I can become crazy for Jesus I can give up anything sometimes even parents yes the Bible says it sometimes you have to do that give up everything and the man the Bible says he was sad in his heart because he had great positions and he went away from Jesus but he was sad the moment you have an encounter with Jesus he is the word whether you believe it or not you can never be the same and to those of you hearing me today you can never be the same again you see when you don't believe it you will walk away but when you believe it amen you will totally be happy that's the only thing Jesus told to do the man to do said everything so what is it that he had to do is to obey what Jesus was saying is to become a Believer God Hallelujah in Jesus was telling him there is only one thing you have to do I have done everything for you only believe in me go and do what I'm telling you to do believe in me by faith Hallelujah am the only thing we have to do is have faith faith in the word we are served by [Applause] what we are served by work come on by faith through Grace it is a gift of God no man can boast about by faith alone through Grace now Faith in what faith in a finished work are you understanding what I'm saying now here he came to the world because the world was sinful and because the world could not help the sin that was in them everyone was born in sin and you know man had to be broken and mangled and all those things and die so that he can be red but Jesus came and he changed the holy he came because I was guilty he came because I was a sinner he came because I couldn't do it on my own he came because I had transgression he came because I had iniquity and he came and he was wounded for my transgression and he was breathed because of my iniquities and the Bible says by his stripes not mine his I am healed I am healed I am healed from sin I am healed from disease I am healed from the world I am healed from every of Darkness I am healed because he came so it is all because of Jesus Christ that's all we need to do to have faith in his finished work hallelujah hallelujah and when you receive that Faith he fills you with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and now that Holy Spirit Will begin to do every work every good work so you don't struggle on your own you don't struggle say oh my God I love that smoke oh God take it from me I don't struggle anymore it is by Grace It Is by grace even when I smell cigarette I feel like vomiting why Grace took over in my life took away the appetite I don't love smoking I don't love drinking don't love immorality why because Grace took away he took away my life and he gave me his life now the life I live is not my life it is his life living in my life I am living because of him my life is dead and I'm alive in Jesus Christ that is the message we believe praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise God so if you see yourself struggling simply means you've not yet received the Holy Spirit but when you do it's all over what did he do the wrath of God was upon us for being Sinners no one could save him there is nothing we could do we are all born in sin sh in iniquity the word speaking life and what did he do he came to the Earth hallelujah hallelujah and tread the wine press all the Wrath of the almighty God was upon powered out upon Him Thou Art Worthy oh Lamb of God for you were slain taking the sins of the world and he B our sin that God powered out the fierceness of his wrath upon you you don't have to worry about your sins now the only thing is to do to repent of your sins and leave his blood to cover amen and he was wounded for our transgression he was breeed for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace upon him his stripes we were healed never man did like that man he suffered until the blood and water separated in his body and the drops of blood dropped out of his of his brao before his death praise the Lord let us lastly read Revelation 5 vers one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven knowing Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their on there was no man in heaven there was no one in Earth there was no one under the Earth I'm saying there was no one every place that ever existed there was no one that was worthy what is this book the book is a book of redemption it contained the names of all those that were to be redeemed the names were in there they were predestinated they were known before the found of the world their identity was in there are you hearing me church but you see the book was sealed with Seven Seals so these could not know that they were in there I'm trying to simplify it for for us now but you see he said here you know there was no man in heaven on Earth under the Earth that was worthy what is this there was no one able to save there was no one able to redeem everyone was a sinner from Adam to Moses to Abraham everyone was a sinner no one was worthy because you see being a son of a sinner you become a sinner so no one was a was able to open the book and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their on and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed oh hallelujah amen the lion of the tribe of Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book to lose the Seven Seals they who is this lion I ask you who is this lion lion is a king king of kings but is not just a king is the king of the tribe of Judah the root of David and remember God promised David and everlasting Kingdom a kingdom Without End this one who is Worthy is the root of David he a li so he's a king and I beheld and law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders I saw a lamb so when the voice told John that the lion of the tribe of Judah John turn to see that lion and when he turned to see he saw what he saw a lamb a lamb it was not a living lamb it was a dead lamb do you understand what I'm talking about the lion became the lamb God is a spirit God is the king of kings but God he became a l himself and became a man who was Jesus he was the Lamb of God Tak away the SS of the world so when John turned to see he didn't see the lion but he saw the lamb who was Jesus he was God himself who put on flesh to come and die for our sin God himself there was no one could save her we were all lost we were all lost in our sin trespasses no one could save us I tell you no one can save you today your pastor can't save you your brother can't save you your mother can't save your father can't save it but there one who can save even your Prophet can't save is it amen but there is one who can save us the Lamb of God Jesus Christ he was slain having hor seven having seven horns and seven eyes and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the praise the name of the Lord we are the people of the open book Revelation 10 an angel came down having an open book and you know what we have had our names being called my name was on the book your name is on the book the names of all those who [Music] believe by faith you realize those who are going in the Rapture listen to this they are not going to the Rapture on the basis of works I am not saying their Works will be bad I'm saying not they will not go on the basis of their [Music] Works they will go on the basis of his work we are actually the real people the beneficiaries of the of the Cross because by his work we are SA we can prove it because our life changed the things we used to do we don't do them anymore our sisters don't wear trousers they don't dress naked they don't walk out naked our brothers they don't go around chasing after girls our sisters our Holy Ghost fi they changed those are the ones I'm talking about those are the redeemed and those are the ones going in rapture praise the name of the Lord and their names were called and I believe I'm one of them because I was guilty he came and died he came and gave his body he was bitten he was stri naked he he he was smitten his body was mang and he shed his blood all for me praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah now I just want to change the order of the service in the communion message the prophet says many of the churches has closed communion Clos communion they have closed communion that is just to their own church when they have their communion but here we are not a denomination we have a we have a open communion for all for we believe that every believer has a right to the table of the Lord and to Fellowship around the good things of God with every believer regardless of GRE color or whatever he may be that all have been made to drink of the self same blessing that is Christ shall we turn to 1 Corinthians 11 so you can see what we are going to do can I have one or two deons close by please First Corinthians 11: 23 it says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in the which he was betrayed took bread you can read verse and when he had given thanks he broke it and say take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sapped saying when he had sapped okay that is the cup like drinking saying this cup is the is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me amen believer say amen for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord his death till he come when we eat that bread we are showing that Jesus died for me for me he died because I was guilty that is to say I am no longer guilty hallelujah hallelujah wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood of the body and the blood of the [Music] Lord You Have To don't just come and you know this is not like at home taking food or just drinking things you are showing the Lord is death that he died for you but if he died for you have you really given your life to him is your life surrendered to him or you are living under unconfessed sins before you take it put your life right because if you don't he says you are guilty of the body and the blood of but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not designing the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many die so this is not a joke for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chested of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world where for my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together un condemnation [Music] praise the Lord if the musicians can come please we have to do this hely if you have something to put right just do it amen amen the deacons know who will partake of this we have little children and and maybe people who are new that's okay they be excused but the Believers all the Believers amen amen I'm going to have our Deon Brother
