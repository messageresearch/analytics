TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] he [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] hello uh our viewers today greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ welcome once again to the bench with pastori uh pastori here once again speaking to you from our program it's been a while uh uh without having uh a guest on the bench uh but by God's grace we've got somebody here to talk with today and I believe that our conversation will be a blessing to many young ministers as well as many young people to just Inspire them and even older ones alike just Inspire them to to for for us to know that God is still God is the same yesterday today and forever he still doing his works uh he's still calling he still sending many into the mission Fields until the last one comes in the scripture in the Book of Matthew 24 says verse 14 and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come so and to the uttermost parts of the Earth this gospel will go up to the uttermost parts of the earth now we know the Bible speaks of uh the woman the queen of Shiba and we know that she was the queen of Ethiopia and she was coming from the uttermost parts of the earth to go in Jerusalem and see the wisdom and hear the wisdom of Solomon and so today we have someone from the land of Ethiopia our brother Ephraim uh Abdu Dango and so we would like to greet you brother brother Ephraim God bless you maybe if you could just take a moment and with the viewers uh that'll be wonderful God bless everyone uh my name is brother Ephraim I came from uh Ethiopia uh doing a ministerial work there may God bless all the viewers and all the people that are here amen so uh we've had many people on the bench here we we've had pastors we've had businessmen we've had elders and so and even younger ones as well but we've not had had uh uh someone like you a a a young man but also a real dedicated gospel Minister and so before we get into your ministry and what the Lord is uh doing through your life and your ministry let's go back to the beginning uh maybe to just ask you cuz I see your is it your called your middle name is Abdu that is a Muslim name how did you get that name well uh from the beginning my my father was a Muslim M he started his journey uh with a Muslim family and his father is known in the southern part of the Ethiopian nation which is called s okay so he introduced the the the market of coffee the market of perfume and the market of seeds plant seeds in uh in SEL and he start to import them to to the capital city of Adisa that's how he's known all over but the main part of the impact will be on religious he's a very religious man dedicated man so my father will grow up under him uh in the religious way the same way that he handled it so my father grew up holding the the the the Muslim religion very seriously yes uh are you aware of the beginnings of his conversion and how he converted from Islam to the Christian faith yes so as he was he was doing his Masters there there are some white people Baptist white missionaries came from abroad and he interacted with them so that is how he first believe in Jesus Christ Christ and was baptized and was going to churches and become a a normal believer that's of the Baptist Church that's under the Baptist Church yes okay so I also understand he he would then come to know and be a part of several other denominations yes yes how old were you then by then I was I was three and four and uh my mom will also uh be in the Baptist Church with him and she she there with him also and mainly what he does is apart from the work he goes as a missionary person taking that that gospel out of the out of the city and he usually ministers there and that is how he become to be introduced to the ministry okay yes so uh you you were born after he converted or before he converted after he's converted after he converted into Christianity so you were born in to a Christian home that's right by a former Muslim right all right right uh so because people would wonder Abdu here it is a Muslim name that is true um so that that's quite an a background you know it goes back to predestination and you told me the other day you were preaching about predestination amen how God knew us before even we were here amen uh you were born by somebody who came from from Islam you know background but he himself would convert to Christianity and then now we are seated here with a preacher of the Gospel we'll be able to talk more about that amen now um maybe our viewers what you would also want to know before we get into a little more of his uh the testimony of brother Ephraim is that um uh we got connected with him a little later uh when of of course my wife and I of course many of you I believe you know those who do not know by God's grace God has sent us had sent us to Ethiopia at the time we were there since 2013 and we had been doing missionary work um you know baptized a few people we were starting a Ministry there at the time and just having a handful of Believers uh in the in the young work which was beginning there uh but eph you know we get to get to know him a little later uh but mainly it was the connection the connecting Factor was his father um I understand that your father came uh came to the message yes you know which year he came to the message um he came in 2007 mhm he by then after he left the Baptist Church M he went on to a menite church okay where he was a pastor in a church there okay so when he was working the minonite church uh an evangelist who came from Kenya with the message will come to him and talk to him okay in the office uh so this this evangelist will actually introduce the message to him by then okay so afterwards he receive the message he told me it was not easy converting you he he personally told me it was one of the hardest job to convert your father from a manite not to the message Believers so now he converted it and then now he become a believer of the message so he left all the position he had in the menite church he left his pastoral ship and he came now to the message and I would think at that time you were about 6 seven years old exactly and so your father you know starts his journey into the message yes and uh he long story short passes away that's that's right you remember the year he passed away 2011 2011 yes so uh at the time did you and your family had you followed him into the message or believe the message yet well uh this is a main point that uh my father was uh was believing this message in the level of a ministerial position he was in the level of ministerial position Okay so so now before it gets deep with my mom he takes me and my sister everywhere he goes to minister this these truths that he has usually what he do is he give out books okay to different parts of the the the country so he will take me and my sister and my mom uh throughout the the country to give out the books that are printed in vgr books to give out to the world so the main point will be that I believe it was an inspiration for him to pass away okay because the day that he passed away we had a very good time with him yes it was so personal so uh real to me as I can feel it now and the more I get to continue with the message journey I understand slowly okay what happened was before he died he takes me to a trip MH and told me there is something that I want you to to know okay but it could be very soon but I want you to dedicate your life for this one and when he's talking about that he came from a Muslim background so when Muslim dedicate themselves for one thing it is as real get so he told me seriously to take this very seriously MH and at night we'll go back home he'll he'll take out a book MH three books that are the church age books The Seven Seals and the C part one and part two he'll give me that and the other one will be the CDs that are from 1947 up to 1968 the old CD Park he will give me those he told me there is nothing I will inherit you m but this I have inherited for you this is the best I can give you so until the last day hold this one never depart from of course by then uh I I listened to him but you were about 11 years you couldn't make up for everything he was saying or fully understand it yes and uh did I also understand that your mother and your sister at the time had also not uh got the revelation of the message yet and uh that you were closer to your father and he now leaves he leaves all the books that he had of the message or the work that he has he had received of the message to you as an inheritance when you don't even know what it is that is true that's amazing that is true so sometimes actually the first day I heard you speak that I was really moved I remember you you brought all those books to me and told me this is the inheritance my father left me and I was really moved because sometimes maybe this goes to the parents and whoever might be listening to uh to our live stream or or a little later what we our children may be young they may not even make up in their mind what we believe or what we stand for but it it is our responsibility to claim them it is our responsibility to apply the token upon them upon our family you know the message books they may see you reading the message books they may hear you listening to the tapes they may not understand what it is they may say reading the Bible but you see what they see and they hear it will later on a seed that you're planting in their life and will come it will later on come back again and it will never leave them um if you're doubting that wait until you hear the full testimony your brother Ephraim and so uh he passes away and then you you you you pack up these books and keep them and you know you carry on with your life that is true I never knew what the book where mhm uh all I knew is an instruction of my father that this thing is important because I knew he meant it real but I never knew what the book were because he keeps he keeps the audio in the morning he listen it and at night he listen it and I knew that voice MH and it was something special for him I knew it and that is where after he the TS of brother bam that's right okay that is after he passed now I try to take what he really meant let me let me see what it really meant so I keep listening I keep reading I keep listening I keep reading so where that is all the journey starts in 2013 is when my wife and I went to Ethiopia and uh when we arrived there we were of course connected to uh a sister and a few other people who later on believed and you know we started a Ministry with with them a handful of people but before we had gone there there are other people that had come into Ethiopia before us many brothers especially from Kenya and from Malawi from Zimbabwe some of them were expatriates working in Ethiopia and so among these I think is the Evangelist that our brother ephra talked about that were was able to get to his his dad and introduce the message to him but also there was another brother from uh from South Africa that came to visit it uh in Ethiopia and was connected to your dad yes tell me about this man and how and when you met him for the first time okay so uh Pastor Joseph from South Africa and my father were very close before they knew each other and they both go out for a mission to evangelize so my usually my father goes out with him and he translate for him and help him to reach the souls that he needed to reach okay so when my father passed away way I'll be the one taking his his SIM card his phone by then okay so I was taking every time with me and unfortunately I would receive a call MH and this brother I knew this brother that called me because he was one of the Believers and the members that my father used to uh minister in those in those places okay those are message Believers but they have backs leaden already because they they don't have someone that can take care of them and things like that so this brother will tell me a brother from South Africa had come and they are a friend of your so already I knew Brother Joseph okay but I was little by them but his he his his uh his appearance is like as if I have known him a very long time ago so Joseph will come I I believe it is you who received uh Joseph while you speak about his coming cuz I did not know that part I'm actually getting to know that part right on this interview wonderful um and no wonder we have four gospels and one according to Luke one according to mark one according to Matthew because one cannot cannot have the whole perspective of what really happened very true because on my end we of course received Brother Joseph when he came to visit and you know he did not know where to start from he literally came to us and he said um I think some brother brother Becket and and and in in in South Africa and other brothers had connected him with us I think brother Tim do was in South Africa also and when brother Tim told him that there was a church in Ethiopia he was interested and he said I'd like to go because I have this family that I wanted to track and find and so now when he arrived in Ethiopia we he informed me where he was we picked him up and then he told me there is this family of my friend who passed away uh that I would like to get to I'd like to find them I'd like to get to know how they are doing do you know them I said I do not know them I've heard of the the the the brother but I had never met him I wanted to meet him but he passed away before I could meet him and so uh we tried to drive to the place you know where Brother Joseph thought that you people were living at the time and you and your family we couldn't find it so we found eventually after a while you know through a lot of searching we found a place and these people gave us a contact and I think this is the contact that now we called and they were able to direct to direct us where you were now living at the time I don't believe it was easy to find us it was not because by then we were having a lot of uh financial problems with with with my mom so we keep shifting yes we keep shifting to find the actually we went to several places people keep kept on directing us this place we go there you're not there go to another place we don't find we go another place until we arrived at this place where you you you living at the time so it will be this brother calling me used to be a message believer but now Backle he told me there is a pastor that has come from South Africa and he is a friend of your father now we need to come to your house M so I directed them to to the house where we living and it turns out it was not Brother Joseph only but you were there yes and your wife was there yes uh brother GMA was there and sister yodit was there so that's how we met and uh when we I think it's your sister that came out first then your mother when you came out of the room that's a moment I'll never forget because it really stuck with me I saw you coming out and at that moment the ho Spirit just began moving you know you could tell when the Holy Spirit begins moving people you know feel the Holy Spirit differently I know how I feel the Holy Spirit when he's moving and he's going to do something and I was my wife was standing by my right and then I started telling her these words I said darling she said yes I said you see that young man coming out she said yes I said he's going to believe the message and he's also going to be a preacher of this message amen and my wife you know we we had been married then for a few years so she she knew well I don't see speak such words in an idol way and and so she said amen amen amen we receive that we believe that so later on of course we came and began interacting with the family well what do you recollect of those moments well I didn't know the the prophecy yeah of course no we did not share with it yet uh that time uh usually I spend most of the days in the street playing basketball trying to look a away of my opportunity to survive what should I do what is my career so I was having a very big whole space in my heart where it doesn't fit yet I am very interested to know what my father is giving me so I read them every day along along the way so when you came I thought these are just visitors and I knew this person Pastor Joseph he he was there with my father he just came to visit us and they're going to leave somehow so we receive you as a guest and I remember uh Pastor Joseph will pick up I don't know if it is a tablet or a Bible he picks up and start to speak some few words MH so those words that he spoke it was about Noah and his age that he's living in and the message that he has received and God has sent him for that age so whenever he is speaking those words I remember he's speaking what my father has already given me and then you will come up and you will speak uh before you pray you'll speak some words and I will have another big question in my heart again now why did these people came and now I'm realizing these people are not just a guest there has to be something with my inheritance I receive because I have been reading and something that I read is now you're repeating the same thing yes so that is how I just thought about it by then so you sit down and for many of you you may not realize it for the visitors but me now I'm getting impacted like right now I think now I'm trying to understand what my inheritance is so that is the only thing that will happen uh Pastor Joseph will greet my mom and give us respect and try whatever he can and he prayed and also you you prayed with your wife and brother gmai will do the same thing with his wife sister yodit and that is how you left us yes so from that moment on there was now attaching the book from the visitors yes I am starting to attach the book from the visitors so I will desire to know more of you to understand what this book is yes so every time I try to call Joseph told me that this is a trusted person that you can talk to to him so I receive your phone call and I start calling you how are you what are you doing yes and things like that so I think that is how now we became very close and you can continue from there and uh you've mentioned youit and G husband several times maybe for a viewers who do not know sister yodit was uh the woman some of you have had a testimony how uh the message you know went to Ethiopia um the the man that we met uh in Nairobi gave after baptizing him uh he gave me this contact he said please if you would uh go and baptize my brother but also uh if he believes and also my my priest so he gave me the contact of his brother and his priest so both of them came but the priest had it accepted it but did not believe it but his brother actually was so impacted by it and was baptized that same day so when he came out of the water he gave me a contact of a sister and you know this would turn out to be sister yodit and it's not y his testimony today so we will not go in the details of that but youit really was a great pillar in the in the early uh time and starting out to to reach out so by this time I think it was a few years after her her conversion because she was already married and the church had already been started and so the work was already going on we had several Believers by then I think we had about uh 20 Believers or so at the time and the church had already been established and so um we now find Ephraim and his family uh they had had an encounter of the message but not the family when the dad passed away the family had not yet uh fully understood really I should say that uh the message in his entirety but now you understand this is the only uh inheritance that your dad had left for you and here are people one from South Africa one from uh two from I don't remember where they were two or one from Ethiopia and then myself and my wife from Uganda and here we are speaking about things that were so connected to your inheritance so you got interested amen you know when people talk about inheritance it sounds like a lot of lands houses and Estates but to you it was something Eternal amen something Eternal amen um I think we'll talk about about that a little more shortly so then um we depart after exchanging contacts and I don't remember do you remember how did we meet again uh did you call or how how did that happen uh I'll be I think I'm the one to call you MH uh because I wanted to find out if what you're saying is connected to the my inheritance that I've been holding for for the last many years yes so if somehow it turns out to be interested with the with the in irritance that I have so I'll continue with you until I found out what's the point of it yes that is the main reason I called you yes so to see whatever you're saying would link up with this yes and so you called me and we received you I remember we went even at home and we even went at church and um the memor is a little bit fuzzy then tell me of the things you recollect I me it's meetings actually the the guest that we hosted by then when you came and when uh Pastor Joseph came and when brother GMA came it was an international people coming to our house so he he insist for me to come on Sunday so he'll be preaching on Sunday okay so that is the first someone I heard him preaching about and it was about the Fifth's gospel okay who was preaching uh Brother Joseph oh he were we were still having him at church yes we were hosting him so he was the first to preach in the Fifth Gospel was the mother so he was speaking I still have the the memory what he was speaking on whatever he will be speaking on will make me Zeal zealous to understand more about my inheritance because he's touching some few points that I've known already so that is what will open my heart to come to you you and now I'll become so close to you so in touch to you to know more about it so there is one time I know and I came to your house and I told you does the message that my father preached and received is it the same with youth and I remember that I remember that question yes because now if it is not I'm not wasting my time I I I'll shift and do my things so when you tell me yes then I became more interested in you okay and try to understand more what what it is all about okay so when I come to your house Mama SAR mamaa was there the children two of them was there so you gave me you gave me uh a book yes so when I saw that book yes the the the message book I say this picture on top of this picture I have it at home M and I came to tell you that I have this book now see this book in those books I have underlined it I have things of I wrote on this I have question marks something like that so now I'll become so close to you to understand what it is all about and I will come to the office and tell you I have I am more interested to know about this now yes do you remember how many services you attended then before the decision was made uh I only attended Joseph's uh Pastor Joseph service and I left and then you left yes M yeah and after I left I will contact to you in one year MH that will be 20 2017 still in the end of the year so that is when I became so close to you and you start telling me what the message is all about yes and uh at the time you were in school and um you know I think I don't remember which grade you were concluding then yeah um and there is a time you came uh back to church and uh after I think you you you you disappeared for quite a long time and then you reappeared what made you disappear for a long time uh the disappear came from before I was baptized okay uh because someone told me I should be baptized and I said why would I be baptized and why would someone think of baptizing me and so I'll start to have these doubts of the message and I remember the devil was trying to attack with a lot of depression I was having a lot of depression trying to make me live this inheritance that I've been focusing all those years and even in the school even in the life everything that I was seeing it was putting me down and putting me down and putting me down so I said which was not the right decision I said let me separate myself from everything and I I will see how the life goes when I do that I couldn't do it without the books yeah I couldn't do it without the CDs so every time I have to listen to those and one time I said there is the thoughts that my father spoke the instruction that he gave me the the the real the real feeling I felt it in my heart and I say now if I'm going to give it my all I have to be baptized if I'm not going to leave it at all I I should stay away from it so it came to a point where I should decide so for that decision to happen you know decision is a process for that process to happen I was taking a long time a long time away from the church seeing all the opportunity I can take so there is a time I said now I will be baptized yeah there is nothing that will stop me so I called brother gmai and he's a person that I I shared with and then he takes me to you and then I'll be baptized that Sunday and it changed all my life after that and uh what do you recollect after your baptism uh did you come back to church yes so now before I baptized I said I'm going to dedicate myself to this message I didn't know nothing about Ministry I didn't know nothing about singing worship all I knew is there is nothing that is changed outside like my physical body the things I have look there is nothing but something has changed in my heart there is a inner peace I have found that will change my heart and that peace allowed me to settle allowed me to come down in one place and then listen to the sermon what was um what is your recollection of the services cuz I know now you had been baptized and you'd be coming of course me I see new people people come people go and you never know who is really feeding or who is here for what um but I would like to know now I'm getting into your mind where I wasn't then when you would come in the services what would be your perspective on the services how would they impact your life all right now I mean this is someone uh who is I I know Ethiopians you call us Africans as if you're not Africans so this is someone from Africa preaching and uh and uh you know he's a foreigner and you know he's shouting all over the place and and then I mean how were you making of what was going on wonderful now to make it to church was was very difficult for me because because of the transport I have to take four taxis to reach to to the to the to the service and we have service every Wednesday every Friday and every Sunday yes Sunday was not a challenge but making it on Wednesday and Friday was a challenge so the decision I made before baptism help me to come to the churches yes and whenever I I'm coming to this service it becames real it is becoming more real and more real to me every time I'm Fellowship there so now I believe that is the phase I took to dedicate myself for that time and I dedicated myself just to listen what the preacher is preaching of course I didn't come with an open heart by then I came with a prepared book with a prepared notes to see a mistake from the preacher so that's how I will come on the first of phases the second phase will be now I wanted to to to impact myself with those words and settle in my heart I want those words to be settled in my heart that was the process in the bridge I was having by then I think this is uh giving me a little inspiration to tell our viewers um maybe a minister or a younger minister or a younger Pastor might be watching this or watch this later sometimes we want people to believe and be changed that same day um it's a process it's a proc process because I mean imagine someone coming in the first time they they are coming to find mistakes the second time you know they are coming to know they're coming with an open heart so I think we also need to focus on what we are preaching and thank God for this message because in this message we're not preaching our ideas or our thoughts we're not preaching about Visa getting Visa or getting rich or getting this as much as all those things are good and they have their place in the Kingdom but we are to preach the word it is the word that molds a character or the character of God in the people because the people are hungry for the word but if you give them the word then the word will do the work brother bam says that the word corrects the error and so let's talk about the opposition um there was a time that you had opposition from your family about coming to church was it before baptism or after baptism it was uh after baptism because before I was baptized I have to inform them that I'll be going going to the to the to the church yes so my mother had a special gift she had a gift of discernment yes she don't care whether the the person knows about Genesis to Revelation or or from 1947 up to 65 all those things she have a special gift called discernment so she will she will have those question in her heart if this boy goes to this if I let him go and he is dedicated to this what about his his job what about his school what about because if I get hold of something I will take it as it is until I found what it is all about so she was leaning more for me to to have the school to focus on the school and to focus on the side jobs that I'm doing so that's real point of view of things yes so but there is a point she said right now I have seen something I believe that is the right place for you to go because she didn't want me to stay in the street and wait for some job to come and I take it she said that is the best thing you can do is go to that church I believe not do that I believe it is the Lord spoker to do that because if I'm working there and she's singing I'm benefited and I'm going to school she'll be happy for me to do that but the Lord spoke to her that she'll be happy interested if I go there MH so out of nowhere this happens but she told me she's not coming with me yes I remember that yeah yes so there is a special reason for her to say that which which is not necessary to speak but she said I will not go to that church specific something to do with her past encounters and yes because she have encounter the message Believers before yeah and she knows things that was not happy for her and after that now is a time where I tell her what I have heard in the church where I respond to her what I have heard in the church and when she see that process going on and going on going on she already knew the message she already knew what what it is all about but for her to join the fellowship it was the hard part yeah so slowly when she see the progress and slowly when she see things are changing and things are improving and things are God is doing something from the inside then she came up to me and she said on Sunday I'm going with you praise God so I was surprised I said okay we will go together and you know Ephraim when it comes to parents uh let me talk a little bit about that as well when it comes to parents sometimes uh parents want to look at things in a a realistic uh point of view my son has to go to school my daughter has to go to school I'm going to even take them to the best school I'm going to take them to hostel I want them to get the best results get the best job but the whole time they're not considering the spiritual life of this child yes you see it's a good thing to want your child to want the best for your child but also consider the spiritual life of this child as much as he is growing in the things of the world and in the knowledge of the things of the world he also needs to grow in the knowledge of the things of God because you see both of of these things are needed and after all it is God who really controls and and and and makes all things work out and then on the other part of how your mother the perspective she had of the former or the some Believers that she had received um been in contact with perhaps maybe three or five it also goes to show that it is not what we speak it is the life that we live because you see our Prophet said show me don't he said that instead of preaching me as someone leave me one the life that we live will preach to the people and will make them want the the message that we have but if our life says something else other than what we are uh are saying then people won't be interested they won't be interested so your mother I believe she I don't know why but I think when she let you come and then you started you know coming for a while then she also got interested and started coming I don't know like I said but I I I want to believe that it must have been what she had been what she had seen you becoming that is true I I believe the Lord SP to her directly by them because she will not make that kind of decision out of nowhere because you see my father was a minister and she was with him and one thing I know he doesn't baptize people quickly he want them to come to him to ask them for baptism because in the scripture we see it was not Paul it was not Peter instructing the people now let me baptize you he didn't preach to them about baptism sermon no he preached to them about Christ this Christ has made him both Lord and Jesus Christ for you now when he was speaking that word that word inside of them B the question up to him and said what can we do now and he instructed them now you can be baptized so you see that is what there's only one instance in the scripture where the apostles H asked the people to be baptized and that was in the house of Cornelius yes when they had received the Holy Spirit then Peter told told them now if you have received the spirit like us then be baptized as a proof that you have received the Holy Ghost otherwise all the other places it was the people the kind is asking baptize us that is true yeah sure so I have seen those things happening in the fellowship but after my pass my father passed away she saw a very wrong Spirit she saw something that was not appropriate so it made her leave the leave the leave the membership or the fellowship that were there and my sister took the same decision with her so now it was a very difficult process to let them know it is the same message but different it is different people it is a different Fellowship now so slowly she was able to understand it by God's grace and I believe the Lord has informed her to do this and she she went to church I wish she was here but to to answer this but you'll answer on her behalf when she came what was her comment after coming to the church she was still very suspicious about it yes even though the Lord spoke for her to go she was really suspicious about it but it was a sad service that made her accept now this truth and actually can be in this Fellowship so that is when we start now coming regularly to church now she's free she can worship and she have met the Lord there by herself yes amen and um there is a time I think I don't remember for after how long maybe shortly after baptism or before baptism I do not remember you can remind me then uh she let you come to our house was that after baptism or before that was after the fellowship after I have after she also started coming yes okay uh how did she allow you to do something like that um the same way that God has told her let your child go to that church I I believe that will resolve everything MH yes so uh because my wife and I you know talked we we in a foreign country and we had to really be careful uh and I know I had people around me who would always advis you have to be careful you know you're not in Uganda you have to be careful you know how you bring people close and and but you know we just decided within ourselves we said no we're going to adopt this boy we're going to make him our son and um we we just I don't remember even how we discussed but then you end up in our house yes uh how how was it was our was your stay in our house and uh as our child at the time I don't remember how long maybe one year or one year and a half or two um um did it bring you closer to the Lord or did it take you further away did you learn more or did you learn less yeah actually I stayed there for one year mhm and in that year is now where I knew I am called for something yes because my father used to tell my mother he is he is a a minister of the the gospel and I used to run around and play with it or whatever he said and my mother has caught up the same thing tells me I am I the minister of the Gospel but she knew if I go to that lane I will I will I will lose some balance so she's trying to keep me in both sides where I can so that is a time I felt like there is something God has called me for but I don't know what that calling was by then but I start feeling that call but I don't know how how to respond to that calling because I don't know what the calling is it started with a burden with a heavy burden to the lost souls and by then I don't know what the calling is I don't know if it is singing I don't know if it is uh worshiping I don't know if it is cleaning I don't know but I knew there was a calling but I cannot be specific on that calling so that was the experience I was having by then and then before the last uh year end there was a brother from Kenya brother Daniel who came and preached for us on Friday service and his sermon was receiving the Holy Ghost yes so on Friday night after I heard the sermon we go back home and I keep asking the Lord what is this Holy Ghost I felt and I felt a trust that I should receive this Holy Ghost because they keep saying Holy Ghost it will make you do this it will make you do this it will so I want to know what the Holy Ghost is and I cannot know it by my knowledge I want to feel it I want to experience it myself so after his suon that left a question mark in my heart to go back and seek and I realize The More I Seek is the more I pray for the Holy Ghost to come and change my life and those two were my two experience in that house for one year yeah and you receive the Holy Ghost can you tell us your experience about that um tell the viewers cuz I know now many right now are waiting to hear how did he receive the Holy Ghost and when and how good because you see this is a question that many have but until someone gives their own experience of it and testimony I mean yours may not be someone else's yes to someone it may you know be very simple and to another one it may be but God fulfills his promise amen so now uh what I can speak is when you receive the Holy Ghost it says you will know the date and you will never forgot that date yeah because it is some experience of your life that you never had before the reason we need a second birth is because e e exactly it cannot debate with the word so it has to come right that's why you see many people they have they claim to have the Holy Ghost but they still deny the word and they still have a woman preacher because they receive the Holy Ghost on their body not on their souls yes they could be baptized on their Spirit Room and in the in the in the flesh but not in the soul that's right so it's a must for every believer to receive the holy spirit amen you know must have that experience amen um then you went back home and after all this experience and we were privileged I I should say uh and the other time in the church I said I'm very proud of you because we were privileged to be a a little pit a little piece and part of your life and and and and and you know to just be a blessing and to be counted worthy to be a part of that because I know uh God has called you for a special purpose in our generation and you know comes to show as we will speak a little bit briefly uh about the work that God is doing through you currently now so uh when you went back home there's a brother came from uh I think Australia Brother Gary Walker you remember him yes and then he he had a burden to uh give everyone in the church at the time a library of the message of the hour and when you say that now your heart was receptive to the message I I remember that bit because um I came up I came down here at the offices of vgr and we were able to buy packs of books um and every believer was able to receive a pack of their own having a full seed library of the message that is true I'm sure you feed on that yes yes how was that now uh actually I want to speak on those things uh for the for the for the viewers or for the people that are listening um it is good to start the message from now 1947 the reason I said it because wherever I see the books I could just pick up and read it but for someone to know what the message is or for for him to preach or for him to have his own mystry from it it is very best to start from 47 until 65 that is very important because to understand Moses we have to understand josa josua because Jo Moses had the first pool and the second pool but Joshua is the one who had the third pool and when we see in the New Testament Jesus Christ had the first pool and the second pool but it was Paul who had the third pool so now it is very important to understand the image of the message not only pointing Joshua or not only pointing Moses so for us to understand what the message is it is best to have the library it is best to know the message from 47 up to 65 that is when we have now understood the problem is people will start from 65 and stay in 65 and don't know the approach of the 47s that's why you see why people have left the message you see they only understood the 65 they only understood the thir pull of it they didn't understand the the second pool and the first pool so that's why you see they pick up errors they do this they do this why because the the message image they have is only on 65 or based on 47 only so having the books at your homes is very essential yes listening to the tapes reading the books when you go back to the Bible it is a new book amen so that's what you did you fed amen you fed on the message and I remember if there is one thing that I can say that I or my Ministry did in Ethiopia is we encouraged the brothers the sisters everyone that was directly under our ministry to feed on the message study the message hear it read it because in there is rupturing faith we believe and um and so your mother and your sister later on believe the message and was baptized and they were baptized and so it was a full family now of believers that's true and later on your sister got married and you know your mother who was always sad she became the happiest in the church true and here is the great deal you also did not become the same after that and that now brings us to uh another phase of this testimony so then we would start to uh come with you to Uganda you know for you to visit I think you visited the first time and then the second time and then this other time you uh you visited one of uh believers who were in Ethiopia at the time and uh you know you linked up with the daughter of the sister who was they were in Ethiopia and then they were in Uganda I don't know what you saw in sister Emma um my wife so to speak is uh is a a different she have a very different and unique character in her yes and I'm sure she's listening to this I hope so I hope so you see uh the first time that we got to to see each other was I came to Uganda and after I came to Uganda uh we went to uh Mama Sara's house to pay a visit and in that visit my wife was not there but um her sister will send me an envelope to give it to someone in our church and I didn't know she was in my in our church yes but when I gave that envelope to the sister in Ethiopia that is when I saw her and that is when I see that's when the Revelation struck you that's right Hallelujah you call it a burden maybe and that goes that takes me back to a few years ago when you were still in our house and we were still in Ethiopia and I was telling you the testimony on how I got married and how at what age I was and I think I was told you I married at 21 and you said I am also going to marry at 21 do you remember those words I believe those were inspiration yes it was yes it was not just a word it inspir it was an inspiration yes because by then there is no way no way I it will not happen so um but slowly when I get to know her when I see her character it was was it was very different she was she was a very different soul she was a different unique character so that made me interested in her yeah so by then she was baptized she was a Believer you took her to to C her to baptize her in that Lake and she was studying the message and we study the message together we we get a phone call and we start talking about the message and the word so finally there was a time that we should make a decision M and uh we made that decision to stay together all I said is uh she was just sitting there and I was driving a car she was listening to what I said and I told her there is one thing I want to do and I told her I want to rest I want to spend my whole life with you wow specifically for you wow and she didn't reply she didn't speak and after two minutes of thinking she said have you prayed about it and I told her yes I've been praying about it yes so she told me let me also pray about it yeah she didn't say yes I know you had previously before that you had told me about it and I had you know we had agreed that you would pray about it and be fast that's that's right so she she goes back to her residence she prays about it and somehow I I thought she's not going to call me back I thought that is a no because she was taking longer but there is a time she called me and she said I have received your request mhm so from then is when we start to move on and the rest is history the rest is history well maybe the brother can put us uh put up a picture of you and your wife and baby you had a wonderful wedding here and and then you have a wonderful family and she's been working here and now coming to join you in Ethiopia I'm sure that it it is for it's it's a perfect timing amen especially for the work of the ministry that you're doing that is true so um uh things happen I come back to Uganda you continue on in the church in in Adis Ababa and Pastor morus uh and then things happened and you went to aasa yeah after you left uh we my mom saw a vision it it all starts with my mom uh she's a very prayerful woman and she saw a a a vision where I'm driving a bulletproof car okay and is very white and inside there was a lot of food packed so for those food to be hot it was sealed in the back the the food Corner were sealed so she was telling me you are driving this car in a very high speed to aasa and she told me that I feel the Lord is calling you to e to to aasa to go but by [Music] then um I'm I'm I'm we are still thinking about with my wife to come to to Uganda to stay there and to do to find out what to do next or to continue with my school or to upgrade on my job things like that so it was a very hard moment for me to decide what to do and I told the Lord if you are the one calling me to aasa confirm that to me because you see in Ephesians chapter 1 verse one it says an apostle of Jesus Christ Paul called by God not by a man m or Not by a bishop because I want to go with a confirmation so I know what I am doing there so I went to a prayer and when the Lord put it in my heart for a burden for me to go there I just wrote your text yes I feel like I'm starting the ministry and I'm I was I was I was texting I remember the Lord is now guiding me to hour I don't know what he has a store for me but I just know he's the one who leading me so I told you and that is how we begin um maybe I just take a moment here to uh while you take a little race and maybe a little drink to tell the viewers about uh haasa um the ministry in haasa really did not start until uh one of us a brother who was a deacon in in the church in Adis Ababa a brother from Kenya his name is brother brother Tim we call him brother Timothy uh Timothy muhanji he um was able to get a job he had a job close to Adis but he got a job now a new job in haasa and uh there was no message Church there in that town he had gone to a a Oneness Church which is really very close to the message and you know most of their teachings and but um you know I kept on encouraging him saying that you know God sent him there for our purpose and um after a little time he had been there he was uh managing a factory there God connected him to one of the workers his co-workers at the at the at the factory uh brother tesan and brother tesan after hearing the message traveled all the way how many hours is it I think four hours four five hours yes to Adis Ababa but but the Tim at the time was traveling every weekend you know to come to the service in in in Adisa so he at that time traveled with after brother tesan had received a witness from brother Timothy and brother tesan was baptized in the church in in in Adis Ababa and so from that time we would now continue going back and forth in haasa at one time I I remember I went with pastor morgus at the time he was my associate in the ministry and then at another time and I think most of the time I went with you brother Ephraim and also with brother ased uh and uh we would just go there meet people um I even I think I I had a picture there I don't know whether you can find brother Isaac of myself and and brother Ephraim um and brother tesan and brother Timothy yes if you can put that up for the people as well so we would meet people like in in restaurants in areas just meet people talk to them uh give them the message and um uh some sometimes University students from from the University and tell them about the message and you know it it it looked a bit difficult but from time to time people would come into the message and one time you know there was like a big Revival just something happened all of the sudden and and people uh just just came up I I had returned to Uganda already but then you know I had this great burden Co time yes that that was during covid time I would never forget that brother Ephraim because at that time you know God laid a burden on me to go to haasa specifically haasa I told brother mgas I'm not even coming to Adis that much I'm going to aasa and I told the people I feel God is going to do something great this time and so um we went to aasa I contracted covid I didn't even know went with brother Ken from from Nairobi and so we were there the whole time preaching to these people but there was God used by the assed God used by the te othy God used brother Ken God used us in a way that we never imagined people just came like mushrooms we baptized brother ephra 30 people in one trip and the whole time we had covid and we didn't even know we had covid at that time I even recorded some um Outreach messages and I was coughing the whole time I didn't even know I had Co but by God's grace the church was started in the house of brother Timothy brother Timothy supported with everything that he can and he is a really really solid solid brother he did a great work in that in that City and uh whenever myself and brother Ephraim myself and brother ased or myself and another brother went there you know uh he would support he would you know um you know buy meals for the people in his house and his wife Salia would cook I mean there many people sometimes we sit with people here at the bench and talk about things but there are many other people behind the scenes that really have done and continue to do a lot of work to support what God is doing especially in Ethiopia and the work of the ministry there that's true and so uh the church was started and then we the people were now many we had to find a place uh we have some pictures there brother uh brother Isaac um of the church so we we we found a place rented it up and and U put up a structure and there was a church and and and and you know people were like 30 40 at times 50 and but I was no longer in Ethiopia time came brother Timothy left aasa uh back to Kenya uh time came there was nobody uh yes of course there were other brothers um that brother tesan was there brother Tesa who was previously a pastor in the Pentecostal was also there uh but all these brothers needed help because they were all new to the message and so we did not seem to have a pastor of the place and um at that time God now moved on you and to now go to hawasa so I wanted to give the people this kind of uh little perspective on why haasa that is true there was already need and then God began moving on you I even never knew that God was moving on your heart to go to aasa amen but you went to haasa that's true against all ODS that's true so you arri in aasa so as soon as I ared in in in aasa it was just a suitcase and inside was a Bible and inside some some few Taps so as soon as I reach I am taking a coffee at one place I want to C down first I want to see what's happening um but before I go my had my wife had a very big intention in aasa she she just loves it so much and she wants to she admires it so much before so now I come down I want her to have a couple of coffee and the guy sitting in front of me told me it is very late you supposed to have a pension a guest house before you sleep and he I told him I'm just coming by the leadership of the Lord and I don't know what he's going to do and he told me I have one room for you where you can sleep yes so he provided for me a room I thought I was going to pay for that room each day but he told me this is just a rental house you can just sleep on it until you feel to move on so he opened the door for me and that time is where the Lord spoke to him for me to have my first home there mhm so that is where everything started actually it was not just for one day or two day I spent there for8 months my God yes and I remember well the only thing I I I did not know ah as God sent him there I didn't I wasn't even sure but I told you if God has sent you if you feel God is leading you to go there then I'm behind you but I didn't even know what you were going to do there I didn't even know what God would do and if God sends you then the devil has to challenge you so you can be sure God sent you that's true then you shared this testimony with me that I felt was quite moving and our viewers would want to hear that then this woman comes to you please share that testimony of that woman that came to threaten you when you arrived in aasa uh actually that one was a prophet oh she was a prophetess uh the there is two people okay the number one is a prophet he told me if you don't go out of aasa I think he gave me a week he told me in a week if you're not going out you're going to die in a very hard disease so that say the Lord you should go out so now I'm at my home Counting the days one day two days now it's going to be my last day in AA what am I going to do so that day reach and I don't even count the because I was counting all the dates but when it left me just one day I just forgot what for I was so busy I was in touch with another people and I found you very busy doing what God told you to do that that's right and I found out that that time has passed after one month I didn't to know what he was spoken about yes and I think that's where now you shared it with me that's right one month after the due Deb of the devil has passed that's right oh let me tell our viewers some of you the devil has given you a due date that's not going to happen in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen my my my my my my and the second thing was there is an old lady I mean she was not normal she didn't dress uh no more dress um she was having a bit of uh awkwardness and abnormal more she told me this m she just appears and told me you only you you're going to have some Vindication in your house number one she said all the things you need in the house is going to be needed that you needed the Lord will provide for you MH and number two God will give you an Open Door mhm that's right and number three God will provide for you what you needed in that compound so it turns out to be before you make a decision in your life it is so important to know the will of God I didn't I didn't just accept what you was saying I said but as soon as I went back home a connection happened where someone wants to give me his his his all his all materials in the house he put it in my house and he left just appeared let me tell you a prophet would tell us that the will of God will not take you where he will not provide for you if it's the will of God he it will take you where his grace will prevail and where he will provide that's right if he wants you to if it's the will of God how do you know it is the will of God if he sends you at at some place he will provide for you he will be with you you won't go pushing the door open that's right he will open the door and then he will go through it that's how you are able to know that God has sent you to some place that's right would you allow me to read some quotes please go ahead um in the mage is trying to do God a service without his will paragraph 55 it talks about how important this is very serious how important to know it's the will of God yes and here it says no matter how much it's needed how much everybody agrees that it's needed how much that it is true there is yet one thing to find out you know he make sure he emphasize many people could agree with it it could be very needful and people have agreed on that basis and it says here there is yet one thing to find out exactly is that the will of God yes and here it is it is showing us it is necessary for the people not only in the ministry side also in your life in your schools in the small decision you take it is so crucial to know if it is a will of God yes it is important to know the will of God and um our generation uh today has a a big weakness of not inquiring from God you know we do things because we are excited we do things because we feel like we we are the right people to do it or we feel like yeah it's the right time it's the you know but we've not inquired from the Lord that's right and this is a very sobering Court no matter how it is needed no matter how many people agree with you you must ensure it is the will of God and you did it was the will of God not not because you followed your mother or because someone came and prophesied over you we believe in prophecies yes but we also believe in making sure that it is God the will of God Amen so you you you are there 100% assured that it is the will of God Amen and so you you are you used to send me testimonies of how many people would believe almost on a weekly basis baptizing people people would be added to the church and and you are really busy you are really busy um you see things things start to happen naturally slowly at The First beginning of few few months it was very difficult you don't know people you don't know whom to talk to things like that yes but slowly it is when after two years or one years that I realize those moments I had was it is God operating in our as something because he was making sure who is going to believe who's not going to believe who's going to receive it and who's not going to receive so he was making a connection he was making a connection which are Divine connection for specific a Divine assignment Hallelujah and I was just waiting for that moment to come hallelujah amen my my my have you met that woman who gave you that prophecy again never she disappeared well that's what happens they never read about such people again but we can continue reading in the book of Acts about what God is doing through your ministry there amen because uh Prophet would say that the church we would be the continuation of the book of Acts that is true so what the Holy Spirit did then he is still doing today and he's going is's going to continue doing and so you were in you how long have you been in aasa now I have stayed for two years now two years yes um and uh during this time you were you were helping the church and yes working hand in hand with brother mores cuz I know he's also taking care of the church there together with brother Tesa brother um tesan brother tesan who recently went abroad yes and brother deesa brother Dees yes and uh the the ministry in Adis Ababa but there's been a ton of events recently that is true where God has uh giv you more open doors that is true can you please tell us about that uh you see um it is very good to be open for the leadership of the Lord because he works not in our own ways he works things that has never been done before so it is very crucial and again I want to emphasize on it it's very crucial to know again the will of God yes uh because David knows the will of God but he has a good intention he has a good burden to me minister to help the Lord to to but it was not the right will it didn't mean it's not it's not bad or he's he's a bad person he was a good person but it was out of the will of God so now it came a time where I was I was sleeping in the bed and I was looking through my phone but something appeared as if I'm somewhere in that place is a hotel and it's 10 minutes away from from aasa so that hotel I I failed to see that hotel but inside there is a lot of people worshiping but outside it's a hotel inside there are people worshiping so I I wanted to know why I saw this vision and I start praying about it and nothing happened I prayed nothing happened but in my heart there is some specific day that I was longing for to go to that place it was Tuesday at 8 8 in the morning I dressed up and I go to that place and already a person who is the owner of the hotel will go to will be waiting for me in that right time because he had a received a vision that a person will come M this day this hour in this minute and you shall hand home over you keiss to him the keys for the hotel mhm so when I stood up it was exactly what I saw I went there not knowing it's going to be 8 or 3 I just appeared to be there at 8 m a.m. I was there already so he came and he told me are you the minister are you the one and I told him what do you mean he told me are you a yes I told him I'm a please take care of the keys this is what the Lord has given you please nourish it and whatever you want to minister here do what the Lord like leads you to do so for me I have to go to another place and do my own own work so he gave me the case I was still trying to process what is still going on because it was too quick too fast and things are just happening so he told me if you need anything just call me I'll be here for you so that moment was so special to me I said Lord you have brought me to this place and inside I don't know what you wanted to do for this so I just took a knee in the hotel I told I told God if you are the one who led me here prove to me that you are here and a a widow running come up to me and she she said are you a minister and I told yes I'm a minister of the gospel and she said okay I feel the Lord guiding me here and if you start to worship what time do you worship what date and I told well I just came here today so from Wednesday and Friday and Saturday we shall Worship the Lord and she start coming from Wednesday and Friday and Saturday what's the name of that place Abella okay the church is called Abella Fellowship okay that is where we fellowship and uh continue continue with the testimony and from her time she start bringing her friendss she start bringing her her her neighbors she start bring and she told me I want you to introduce this message to my daughter so she has two daughters and one of them was about to get married and other one is in school so I witnessed to her she said I have been waiting for this truth to be revealed but I will just sit and wait upon the Lord to do anything so she was she was just sitting coming the church just sitting coming the church yet she's testifying about what she's hearing in in her neighborhood yes so in her neighborhood she will bring all those people and testify about what she's been hearing and at the day continues people start coming start coming and it sh it we we said let us have some ministers with us who could help us and most of the church their elders and the their their their mothers and their aged people coming now to the message of the the truth but recently that daughter got married and when I preach on her wedding two people got saved praise the Lord and they came to the to the message of the hour literally a church started CH of divine leadership out of divine leadership how many sords do you have there we have there over 45 people praise the Lord can can I have a picture of that brother brother Isaac I think we have several pictures of of the church in Abella um if you could share the pictures with the viewers that that would be wonderful I mean I just saw it and I was flabbergasted I was just moved there is uh this this one with the people and and a little video yeah yeah that's that's the one and then there's another one a little video as well as the one inside uh it's amazing I mean what God is doing there what and even how the whole thing started amen do you know how we came to Ethiopia I was praying for 3 years because God had been showing me scriptures each time about Ethiopia and a desire was a desire progressed from a desire to a burden and then from a burden to um you know really that Zeal of wanting to go to see what the Lord wanted us to do there we didn't have any contact we didn't have any money to go um we had just gotten married with my wife um but God sent a brother who he instructed to give us money to go and then also God sent a brother who we did not know when we had the money to go all the way from Kenya called me gave me a contact uh he said that I have an Ethiopians here who would like to hear this message and I've preached to them theyve accepted but when I went to baptize them before I could baptize them I was on the website and I saw your picture meaning my picture I had a website then called the youth message site and uh he said that the Holy Spirit led him to to invite me to come and be the one to baptize those people so when we went to Nairobi with my wife baptized this Ethiopian uh man and um and then he gave me a contact this is the one I spoke about in the beginning and the rest is history and that was the beginning of the whole work divine intervention Divine leadership and and I see the same Trend continuing you know what I see in this brother Ephraim I don't even see men or vessels that God is using I see God behind this message it is hard to say I have done this it's impossible for a man to do this impossible it is impossible it is impossible I mean friends I want you to understand when we share such testimonies we are not trying to lift up a man or another man or the other we are trying to impress it upon your hearts and Upon Our Generation we need to document these things for them for the people to know that the message we hold dear the message we hold dear to ours the message we are propagating the message we are leaving for people men have deed to leave everything you know personally when I received this message I decided to leave everything and leave for this message you have done pretty much the same thing many have done the same thing men like brother Eddie Bisal who has been my mentor for many years he did the same thing he gave up everything for this message men like pedig and many more if the Lord terries for what to advertise the name William brandham to to talk about a man born in Kentucky and things like that it is about God calling a generation to a message that is going to prepare them for the coming of the Lord and these things come to show that God is behind this message it is not a work of a man it is a work of God and we are 100% sure and a man would want to be 100% sure before they even went out to preach or on the street to preach or on the behind a pull pit to preach they would want to be 100% sure God is with them amen one thing we are sure about is that this message is Vindicated we don't need to vindicate it amen I don't need to reproduce the peill of fire that the pel of fire to be on my head and show the people that look I have a peel of fire this message is already Vindicated the PE of fire was already here it is already here but you know it has already come and Vindicated the prophet of Malachi 4 and you know the the the the sign in the hand the designment of the people's hearts and all these things and the truth of the message to vindicate that this message is the truth God himself has confirmed that and I to use that word Vindication because we when we take out this Vindicator message to the souls we don't make them to be a message believers they have already a message believers they don't know it they don't so when the Vindicated truth come to it it will tell them where they were and who they are yes so this Vindicated truth will reveal to them who they are exactly and they will know they are the bride of Christ and let me tell you this ethopia will have a special bride of Christ amen she will have a special bride of Christ and I felt so much the burden of my father and makes me so responsible it will not make me proud or things like it will make me more responsible for what's happening in Ethiopia so I will tell you this ethopia will have a special and a unique bride which will manifest the spirit of God amen amen that's what we want we don't want to I mean we're tired of the politics we're tired of the church politics we are tired of uh the me I I we want to see God being made manifest in our ministry in our life in the people after all this is the only way we can people can be able to know that we are his disciples if we have love one for the other but God is love and if God is in us then he's going to manifest his power that's right yes and um I'm speechless brother brother amen yeah I'm just a little bit emotional about this whole thing you know God just coming down to vindicate and to prove that I'm here I'm leading I'm guiding I'm what more do we want to know that the message is really true that's true and so you've also continued to reach out and U I remember you sent me a picture of this church in Abella the first when you you you had gotten the place and it was empty there yeah it was empty but then these people came and brought the bench that's true by by themselves that's true my God because you see uh yes we need money for the ministry but money is not the absolute yes so when people were coming in they didn't have space to sit yes they were just sitting on the floor so yes I just failed to say this with a humility and respect I told them well if you are what you are hearing is blessing you then you can provide a chair for yourself so actually I didn't know what I meant but the next service they bought a chair from their house my God and they say we have dedicated this CH this chair for the for the Lord Brother Isaac do you have the video ready yes please play the video they just brought the chairs and everything from their houses from their house yes and it was a miracle you know and I want to say they are very prayerful people m you know the days of barrier where whatever Paul was speaking they don't accept it they go back and study it with if it is true or not yes and this these people their special weapon is prayer they able to sense the spirit of God and be so sensitive to to the things you are saying and align it with the word and I would like to say a Ministry that we work without prayer will be man's work exactly but the ministry Hallelujah that we work with prayer will be God's work Hallelujah there is nothing a man will say I have done this it will just take everything to the Lord that's right actually all the glory goes back to God Amen there is um these other places you you keep going back to the Pentecostals One Pastor leads you to another yes and uh there's this picture you shared um maybe brother Isaac can as well share it of this large uh group you were meeting uh how many did you esate to be there you see I I just didn't appear to be there I I met a person that that was a pastor and uh this pastor was not fully believing the message by then but he was led by God to tell me that I need you to go to this church there will be a conference I need you to minister to them so I'll usually go with the track and with the book after I preach I will I will give about the books and things like that so this picture was taken when I was going to the conference yes and I believe the Lord is doing a mighty a mighty work in the south in the North in the East part of Ethiopia yes amen and so you kind of now also Minister among these um if you can enlarge that a little bit brother Isaac to you reach out to these um Pentecostals as well one Pastor leading to another this is just amazing uh and then this testimony that we shared recently in church also moved me I know we we by the way few viewers we never prepare to talk this or that we we just wanted to just have a conversation cuz I mean while I was sharing with ephra he had too much and I was like no people need to hear it that to hear all these things amen and so this testimony that moved me as well of uh how did you meet that pastor Pastor H okay I was invited a conference at chashan mhm I was told there will be a a pastor a Revenant who is going to come and preach so I sat down and I listen to his someon preach that is the first time meeting him so he preach a sermon but the host will bring me to to say a Thanksgiving at the end of the conference okay so after I I said some few words and I I prayed and we Clos the program so they allowed me to sit next to him okay so when I sit next to him is when I receive his contact okay and he told me well if you if you want to meet me you have to make an appointment things like that and he showed me the process so I I received his message phone number I called he never picked yes I called he never picked yes so after trying five times I left it yes so there was a time he called me himself MH he said I was doing this I was busy but right now I can I can speak to you and what can I help you and I told him well the Lord has brought me here to to to give out a message and I would like you to be part of this trip that you listen to this messages so I sent out books for him to read on the phones so he kept reading it and he said after 3 months he had planned a meeting for me to sit with him and have a discussion with him M so he told me you only have 10 minutes to talk to me and that that being scheduled it's an a hotel it's in a meeting yes so we start the conversation in the morning because he told me that he'll be having a flight at night okay so when we started you see the Lord has a way of going and doing things yes we started with with a with a sermon called The Serpent seed wow that is where we started and he told me 10 minutes I'll be done so instead of using 10 minutes we stayed the whole day without lunch and without breakfast we stayed the whole day until he said now this you have to stop I have to go and catch my flight so he left and catch a flight so again it tookes another two two months to come and meet this man and he gave me different ideologies that he was having he was bringing with a different question what the internet says what the other people says and things like that and I told him don't listen listen to the message mhm and what I did is I just directed him to the message so he he's good at reading he keeps reading he keeps reading and finally he came up to me and he said because I'll be here and there I need you to give me a contact of who who brought you to this message who who who baptized you or who is who Ned you in the m so I gave I gave you his contact and I I sent him a link you did not give me his contact No No I gave him your contact and I didn't told you by then because I was so busy you didn't know anything yes because I know he he might not call you or you know he's he's at diseas so there was time that he was listening to the sermons that been preached here that I didn't know about yeah so he was keeping listening live yeah he was streaming live and I was tired at home I came home planning to rest and sleep yeah so as I was laying down he calls me and he said uh do you remember that day you told me you you you can baptize me any time any place anywhere and I said yes yes I remember that time and he said I want to be baptized now praise the Lord and I told him you see now it's it's very late and people are going to sleep and it's dark he said no no I want to be baptized now and I told him okay there is no transport now it's far from me to your home he told me I'm at your gate right now my goodness he usually comes home to take out books yes so that was Wednesday night that was Wednesday night yes it is around 40 9 you mean 10 10 10 p.m. p.m. that is where he was baptized and he went out quickly and and um he sent this message I read it for the people here in the church I mean I was amazed this just blew my mind and he said he he that service uh he was streaming he commented he didn't send this to me directly but he commented it on the YouTube so I usually receive these notifications that people comment on YouTube so he commented and said Shalom greetings to the Saints and you Pastor my name is Pastor H and he mentions the church where he comes from in aasa he say Pastor Ephraim Abdu introduced me to this present truth of the hour amen you could tell that he has really got a good grip on this and he says the last time I went to his church at Abella which is the church we've been talking about and so he mentioned you as his uh mentor and after a while I keep after a while I kept following your channel so this is my sixth time my sixth time listening to the sermons preached I have seen God in this message and you know I told the people that moved me that I have seen God in this message not I've seen how powerful you are how great you are but I've seen God in this message I just feel like crying when I see that when I hear someone testify like that because the purpose the reason why we preach Ephraim is to the for the people to have a direct relationship with Jesus Christ not for for us to front ourselves but for the people to see Christ in us and so he says I have seen God in this message and now I have given all my all to him and he says I now have decided to accept what baptism I will call Pastor Ephraim Abdu now and he says what can hinder me from water baptism fire fire come again and take my side oh my God I was just moved and by the time I sent you this you just said I'm from baptizing him oh my I think this to me it just finished me amen my God am amen so um and and I'm sure there are going to be many more cuz this is a bishop this is a bishop that's right he has many churches behind him if he has been convinced of the truth no doubt he is going to be concerned about taking this truth that is true all over this area that is true and uh tell us a little more about what is happening there are there other churches other places starting up now the Revival is going to begin H it's going to start you know the prophet says the Revival starts from the hearts yes start from out inside to the outside yes so people are dedicating their lives now to read the books yes that has been translated and to listen what and by the way people should know that you are also a translator of the message yes I remember the first time I heard you translate uh some people thought I was being um I was doing something wrong because you were young and oh he's young he doesn't know the message so deep and you know and you know but it turned out you're one of the best translators amen amen I I appreciate that have people people there are two kind of people people that see where you're going and what potential you have and the second people they will see it when you accomplish and there's people who see it before that thing happen so I I thank God for for it so right now in Ethiopia what is taking place is the ministers are are packing themselves now to give what the message is to to to to know them you you know now we are in in the phases of telling them there is a difference and they have known the difference and now it is time for them to know what the difference is yeah and to stabilize themselves in the message now that's where we're going right now well um it would not be good to finish this interview without making a comment about the efforts of our brothers in clal and message hub for supporting translation uh because they have also uh supported the translation of the message uh in Amharic in in um also oromia and uh I think the church Ed book is concluded also Somali in inar is that is that started yet Somali has started oh wonderful yes so you can see that this they've really dedicated themselves to do that and that is really the vision of brother bisco amen and uh they've done a good work in that and regarding your ministry of course our viewers you need to understand that brother Ephraim is not a theologian is someone as you heard called of God and he's educated you are educated you you have a bachelor's degree but he decided to fully go into Ministry I never asked him to God asked him to it was a personal revelation um yes I always want young people to go into Ministry but I never push anybody into Ministry or ask anybody to go into Ministry uh it has to be a calling they have to be sure and as you can hear him speak he's mature he knows what he's talking about he's fed on the message and I know God has been supplying buten somebody could be listening and they just all of the sudden receive a burden to support the work there I think they're welcome to do that because there's much to do there's much needed there's much to do but the resources uh are from as many as God gives a burden uh to to uh to support the work of God in the ministry and uh I know that the god that has been supplying and the god that sent you there will continue to supply he he's always faithful he's always more than able he has he's unquenchable he he's he's more than enough and so uh um how is the the church in aasa the the main Church now Ina it's been it's been a blessing because we have uh now a new Minister there he's uh called uh brother Elias okay uh ACC compined with brother Dera and brother Tes yes they are doing a marvelous job there right now they are found in building the church yes so they are constructing and making sure we have the next conference set and ready wonderful yes um we have uh the message in our country has come in the late 70s early 80s so that's quite very many years uh in Ethiopia if we count from 2013 it's just barely uh about 11 years yeah 11 years 12 years yes and so you can see that the message in Ethiopia is quite new and the seeds of the message were sold myself brother Paul in Nairobi came brother Gideon who actually spoke to yesterday and is leaving the country he's been there for about 13 years and other brothers they've really helped and the work of God has you know the seed of the message has been sold in the country true uh but now I think in most of the regions where that that seed was planted they're sprouting out and you were on another phase now like you said a Revival is breaking out and and so some of us would just continue to come come and encourage uh we are also trying to go in the North in in TIG there is a new work there but I think the work is still a lot we talking about how many million people are in Ethiopia 120 million 120 million plus plus um we have only 40 something 45 Millions here for sure and we have many Believers for sure so in Ethiopia there's still a lot of work to do you know what I believe this is my private Revelation EOP is one of the last countries that will receive the message before the Rapture this is my private Revelation so so like you said that Ethiopia will have a special bride I believe that I believe that amen so because it's one of the last countries to receive this message before the Rapture amen and uh it's God is doing it is God is doing amen and um so uh is there something before we conclude this that you would want to maybe tell our viewers maybe you look over to that camera and say something preach something say something whatever it is maybe to the younger generation the younger ministers whatever you feel to say um you see um God has a special uh calling in everyone and actually the prophet calls it everyone is a minister uh we may not turn out to preach we may not turn out to stand in in the Pulpit we may turn out to be behind the pulpit but every person has a diff different calling in their lives and I want us to to to take that burden and to ask the Lord what have you putten inside of me what do you want me to manifest in the age that you have put in me that is very critical and that is very blessing thing to know that you are set for this so you aside yourself from different things and you know where you are heading and you know what you're doing so I will ask the youth if they could find out the biggest problem to is to know who we are to understand who we are to know what we are working for so if they found out yes if they found out their purpose and God's plan in their life yeah that's it yeah amen that that's powerful amen that's powerful many people are just going to and fro now like in Uganda where you have many churches they're jumping from one Church to the other they never rest never settle never sit under a Ministry to grow and and how can they find purpose that is true but I think to find purpose is a very important thing and usually when you do not everyone will agree with you many people will disapprove of what you're doing that is true someone when I was coming to a theer the first time they told me uh you're just going to fail you're wasting your time but you see see uh if it is God it cannot fail because God is the one who reveals your purpose and when he does reveal it it cannot fail that is true and and so uh uh now um after a few years of your marriage your wife is now fully going to join you I'm sure you you are going to be better prepared to go on the fields and to do whatever it is that you have to do and cuz you now have her support as a wife as well as um a prayer partner and so we are just praying God's blessings over you and over her we already prayed here yesterday in church amen and praying that God will give you Grace as you go I'd like to bless the DVA Fellowship for for the host and for the appreciation and for revealing what's happening in aasa and part of

greetings amen we love all the Believers in Ethiopia I always say uh that I count myself a part of the Saints in Ethiopia amen and uh whoever whichever Fellowship whichever uh Brothers invite us to come and support and help them we will come and support them let me speak some few words after after 10 years ethopia will impact the world with this message amen uh she will influence the devil and she will reveal the tactics and his deep secret to the world and expose who he is and ethopia will have a special bride amen that is what I'm longing that is what I want to see before the Lord teres amen that's what we know well uh that's daring of you to say such words just very sharp very strong I know they they send the devil parking well uh may the Lord grant it may the Lord grant it uh we I have no doubt that Ethiopia has a special bride and they special to our hearts you know when I came to Ethiopia myself and my wife thought we were going to stay fully we never knew we were going to exit at some point that's true but God permitted it that we exit if we had not all the souls here that have believe the message you would not have believed it that's true and so we have vessels in his hands where he leads us we go he has led you in that area but maybe next time he'll lead you somewhere else we don't know yeah we do not know but we have vessels in his hands where he leads us we follow amen we follow praise the Lord and so I do not know if there is anybody who wanted to tell something to brother ephra before we CL close um if there is among those of you who are streaming with
