[8:30] it is by his grace
[8:32] i have come to thank god because he has
[8:35] been so real and so good to us
[8:38] and his hand has been so great
[8:41] he has done many mighty things but among
[8:43] all i will thank him
[8:46] for this
[8:47] because in the last like two weeks now
[8:51] the enemy attacked our home with disease
[8:55] sickness
[8:56] we have been battling some days going to
[8:59] hospital buying medicines
[9:01] but this time i stood and said no enough
[9:03] is enough now
[9:06] now i have to fit
[9:09] because now no money for stealing
[9:13] so
[9:14] i decided to stand
[9:16] they all of them all the children got so
[9:18] sick
[9:19] with headache fever they could not eat
[9:22] stomach egg i think it was something so
[9:25] strong
[9:27] like maybe infections what they have
[9:29] been going through
[9:32] i laid my hands on all of them everyone
[9:34] that cried i could lay my hands on them
[9:37] and just ignore the fever even not
[9:39] giving painkillers to
[9:41] calm down the fever i left the lord to
[9:43] do his work
[9:45] i thank god through it all he has been
[9:48] so faithful they all get better without
[9:50] even medicine
[9:53] so after they had become well now that
[9:55] they've attacked their dad
[9:58] when he was taking the children of their
[10:01] sister to
[10:02] to school
[10:04] the devil tried to bring accident to
[10:06] kill him the lord saved him when he came
[10:09] back home he got so sick in the night
[10:12] the whole night he was badly off he
[10:14] could not see
[10:15] he could not eat
[10:16] he passed in the hospital they said he
[10:18] has no disease
[10:20] so in the morning the devil scared me
[10:23] so much telling me that ah now your
[10:25] husband is going to die and leave you
[10:28] how will you be many things he put me in
[10:30] the corner i got so worried
[10:33] so when i was still there i remember the
[10:35] scripture
[10:36] that says that long life and
[10:39] and the length of days will be added to
[10:42] us
[10:43] if we don't forget the commandments of
[10:44] the lord i say but he has been trying to
[10:48] liberate with god how comes the devil
[10:51] just take him when he's still young even
[10:53] i said they forget behind me now
[10:56] i went on my knees and prayed for him
[10:59] when i prayed i said lo let him wake up
[11:01] when he's fine
[11:03] he got up and the night was still badly
[11:05] off again he slept but in the morning it
[11:07] was so fine i thank god for that
[11:10] a blessing
[11:13] [Music]
[11:20] a sign that we are serving a living god
[11:22] amen
[11:23] yeah being that is a living god
[11:26] we have to leave because he lives
[11:29] praise be to god

[32:02] christ has been good this week
[32:05] you know you have had the testimonies
[32:07] of would you listen um
[32:09] the lord saved us from a very
[32:12] which were what would have turned out to
[32:14] be a very terrible accident
[32:19] after dropping airframe in entebbe i was
[32:22] supposed to drop actually we're already
[32:24] in the car with
[32:25] sister stella and some parts of our
[32:28] family
[32:33] family we were taking uh some of the
[32:36] children one was going to namidiango and
[32:38] another one was going to
[32:40] i now forget the school but uh one of
[32:42] the schools there is
[32:48] and so we were entering the road
[32:52] from sunday road
[32:54] uh
[32:56] the oncoming traffic was okay there was
[32:58] no traffic police so
[33:03] the oncoming traffic
[33:05] who came to our standstill so then those
[33:07] of us were turning we are now turning
[33:22] the trailer man thought that
[33:24] i had turned i had like finished turning
[33:27] no sir whatever i lost that motorcache
[33:30] and he was fully loaded
[33:32] up
[33:34] into and so he
[33:35] came head on on us
[33:40] i should say it was the age of the lord
[33:42] that protected us
[33:45] uh by now
[33:47] we would be crying
[33:50] i will not be crying
[34:04] now that the lord has allowed us to

[34:07] for for us to do for him

[34:30] school where she is going to be teaching
[34:58] we i told you to commit you know those
[35:01] needs that you had before the lord
[35:06] believe that the lord will supply ok
[35:09] so uh do not
[35:11] be gloomy about how god has supplies
[35:29] so that's actually one of the reasons
[35:31] why we stream our services
[35:35] you can also be able to stream while you
[35:37] are there now
[35:39] streaming
[35:40] and uh we know that once in a while you

[45:37] why did jesus come yes
[45:39] why did he die on the cross

[45:47] the message go away jesus
[45:49] go
[45:50] go wake jesus
[45:56] says and god the creator of the heavens
[45:59] and the earth the catholic transcendence
[46:02] god the creator of the winds and the
[46:04] waves
[46:10] not they have to obey his word
[46:26] [Music]
[46:52] you see as much as the world is
[47:06] god in the beginning was just
[47:09] was he wasn't even god
[47:13] how many knew that
[47:16] in the beginning
[47:19] rather before the beginning
[47:22] was it even
[47:35] [Applause]
[48:19] that god desired he already was
[48:22] worshipped before we were created
[48:30] the prophet of god
[48:32] god
[49:29] away that he began now to express his
[49:32] nerves
[49:33] [Applause]
[49:34] and so when he wanted to be god that was
[49:38] what did he do
[49:40] he created angels
[49:42] yeah you see when you read the bible you
[49:45] will not find find a bat oh um you will
[49:49] not find a creation account of angels
[50:10] praise the name of the lord amen for him
[50:12] to create angels
[50:15] he only needed worship
[50:19] that they are in heaven
[50:22] watching him everything they have seen
[50:38] a
[50:49] [Applause]
[50:52] where god dwells the throne room
[50:56] so they they they imagine angels
[51:01] they have to cover their feet and
[51:03] themselves
[51:06] because of the holy
[51:13] [Music]
[51:27] [Applause]
[51:34] that is
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:15] oh
[52:43] and do not worship something else
[52:45] worship god don't sing the children
[52:47] shall not sins are catholic
[52:49] worship or worship is a big subject
[52:56] worship is a big subject ah sorry the
[52:58] biggest scenes
[53:07] and now
[53:09] i want to bring it down after he has
[53:10] created angels
[53:27] we come in the creation account
[53:30] after he asks angels to worship him
[53:34] now you can go to genesis 1-1
[53:40] what does genesis 1-1 say
[53:45] read together one two three go
[53:51] see that
[53:54] great
[54:07] he has now become god
[54:23] what you said when he was not gone but
[54:25] yeah
[54:26] by the time we are opening our bible but
[54:28] we are not talking about the bible
[54:30] that we are already created
[54:33] and there were no good and bad angels
[55:16] you see the god i'm talking about does
[55:18] not need something
[55:42] [Applause]
[56:51] [Applause]
[56:54] you see you created the greater light to
[56:55] rule the day
[57:21] [Music]
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:48] [Applause]
[58:10] but there was no one creature which was
[58:13] an express image of himself
[58:48] make man let go no moon too praise the
[58:51] name of the lord amen
[58:54] with me to genesis 1 26
[58:57] and god said let us make man in our
[58:59] image
[59:00] directly
[59:28] and now verse 27 says so
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:45] yes
[59:47] object of worship that's all that you
[59:48] take is the identity since you were so
[59:51] god
[59:53] created
[59:54] man
[59:58] now
[59:59] so he was already being worshiped yeah
[1:00:01] you read that since he was then he is
[1:00:03] creating man
[1:00:06] what do you think was the purpose why he
[1:00:08] was creating that man
[1:00:12] told you
[1:00:13] why
[1:00:14] watch it
[1:00:16] can somebody tell me what was
[1:00:18] what yes my sister
[1:00:22] you needed fellowship
[1:00:26] that is
[1:00:38] to manifest but you know you have the
[1:00:40] right to manifest these attributes
[1:00:41] through all these other things because
[1:00:42] those who are part of his attributes but
[1:00:43] yes also this was a manifestation of his
[1:00:45] attributes
[1:00:51] there was an absolute reason why he went
[1:00:53] on
[1:01:05] but there was nothing created in his
[1:01:08] image
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:23] other time i i preached to you about
[1:01:25] something that man has that no other
[1:01:28] creature has queen above
[1:01:33] one thing that separates us from all the
[1:01:35] creatures
[1:02:06] [Applause]
[1:02:18] separates
[1:02:47] now
[1:02:48] praise the name of the lord amen and by
[1:02:50] the time we finish up i know you were
[1:02:51] right normally somebody would you take a
[1:02:53] date and so we noticed that man that god
[1:02:55] created was in the image of god
[1:03:00] he
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:41] no no
[1:03:42] those are not the right words conquer to
[1:03:44] subdue to conquer can somebody please if
[1:03:46] you have a record throw it out quickly
[1:03:49] yeah
[1:03:50] yes yes
[1:03:53] yes dominion over allah
[1:04:10] you realize
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:17] but where to be
[1:06:19] because there is only one form of
[1:06:21] eternal life
[1:06:24] what we always wear wait wait wait and
[1:06:28] the reason we were in some direction
[1:06:30] early
[1:06:43] amen
[1:06:44] if i exist now whenever i would want to
[1:06:47] if i if how many believe they have
[1:06:49] eternal life

[1:06:54] not going to come i believe they have it
[1:06:56] now
[1:06:57] you know what
[1:06:58] to get in
[1:07:45] [Music]
[1:08:22] why because
[1:10:27] the world is weakening
[1:11:38] where
[1:12:27] how many believe that amen
[1:12:29] praise the name of the lord amen and so
[1:12:32] we know this here why not
[1:12:34] that
[1:12:36] man has always been a part of god
[1:12:41] and god is the only thing that is a
[1:12:43] tunnel
[1:12:46] i want you to see i want to paint this
[1:12:48] picture for you a little more yeah
[1:12:51] god creates everything
[1:12:55] it's just like a man who is planning on
[1:12:56] getting married

[2:15:57] go
[2:15:58] but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to
[2:16:02] accept authority over the man but to be
[2:16:06] in silence that's why even in a home the
[2:16:08] man is the head of the home yes
[2:16:15] even in the church a woman is not
[2:16:16] allowed to be
[2:16:58] an old
[2:17:12] people
[2:17:38] wow

[2:22:06] just like a man a young man like a
[2:22:08] friend could leave ethiopia
[2:22:11] left his parents now they tell us that
[2:22:13] they left everybody
[2:22:16] for a woman

[2:23:50] man she is unadulterated
[2:24:12] and it's no longer married and their
[2:24:14] husband is not to take her back
[2:24:25] that word
[2:24:55] adam took her back
[2:24:57] [Music]
