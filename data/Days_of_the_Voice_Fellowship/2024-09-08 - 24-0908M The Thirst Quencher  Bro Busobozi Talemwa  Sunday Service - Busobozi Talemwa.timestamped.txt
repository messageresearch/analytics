[1:35:50] ver we've read this many many times
[1:35:54] and I know that uh it
[1:35:57] um it can never become
[1:36:01] ordinary scripture is always new to
[1:36:07] us and he must needs go through Samaria
[1:36:10] this is about Jesus he left Judea and
[1:36:12] departed again into Galilee and he must
[1:36:14] need to go through Samaria then then
[1:36:16] cometh he to the city of Samaria which
[1:36:19] is called SAA near the pel of ground
[1:36:22] that Jacob gave to his son
[1:36:25] Joseph and now Jacob's Well was there
[1:36:28] Jesus there being worried with his
[1:36:31] journey excuse me sat thus on the well
[1:36:34] and it was about the sixth hour there
[1:36:37] cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water
[1:36:40] Jesus said unto her give me to drink for
[1:36:43] his disciples were gone away unto the
[1:36:45] city to buy meat then sayth the woman of
[1:36:48] Samaria unto him how is it that thou
[1:36:50] being a Jew askest drink of me which am
[1:36:54] which I'm a woman of Samaria for the
[1:36:56] Jews have no dealings with the
[1:36:59] Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto
[1:37:01] her if thou knowest the gift of God and
[1:37:04] who it is that saith to thee give me to
[1:37:06] drink thou wouldest have asked of him
[1:37:08] and he would have been given the Living
[1:37:10] Water the woman said unto him sir thou
[1:37:13] Hast nothing to draw with and the well
[1:37:15] is deep from when then hast thou that
[1:37:18] Living Water art thou greater than our
[1:37:21] father Jacob which gave us the well and
[1:37:23] drank thereof himself and his children
[1:37:26] and his cattle Jesus answered and said
[1:37:28] unto her whato whosoever drinketh of
[1:37:31] this water shall thirst again but
[1:37:33] whosoever drinketh of the water that I
[1:37:35] shall give him shall never thirst but
[1:37:37] the water that I shall give him shall be
[1:37:39] in him a well of water springing up of
[1:37:43] springing up into everlasting life the
[1:37:45] woman saith unto him sir give me this
[1:37:48] water that I thirst not neither come
[1:37:51] thither to draw you
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:38:22] for
[1:38:52] for for
[1:39:48] amen amen you may be seated please
[1:39:57] I'd like to first of all uh appreciate
[1:40:01] you and thank you for your
[1:40:06] consistence in giving towards the land
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:11] fund uh God bless you so
[1:40:15] much we are making positive
[1:40:19] stries uh we are
[1:40:21] progressing as much as we we have had
[1:40:23] certain things to um a little bit
[1:40:26] decline our
[1:40:31] efforts like from the time of the moving
[1:40:33] to this
[1:40:36] place it kind of declined our efforts a
[1:40:40] bit and uh you know the making of the
[1:40:43] floor
[1:40:45] here uh the
[1:40:49] rent but
[1:40:51] nevertheless we are making positive
[1:40:55] eorts towards the land fund
[1:41:00] project and those of you who are
[1:41:02] streaming and following us
[1:41:05] online maybe you do not know but we are
[1:41:09] currently raising funds to buy our own
[1:41:11] church
[1:41:14] L and we have ways that actually you can
[1:41:17] give
[1:41:21] online uh brother
[1:41:24] those on the media they can be able to
[1:41:26] put
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:30] that and you can also tell your friends
[1:41:32] you know you can give by mobile
[1:41:36] money we are actually working on getting
[1:41:38] M pay and air
[1:41:42] pay because um we we had another way to
[1:41:45] pay directly to the church account but
[1:41:48] it was stopped
[1:41:53] but if we have
[1:41:56] M it can also benefit us in
[1:42:00] our service
[1:42:04] collections because we are in a
[1:42:08] age where you find many people can come
[1:42:12] to church forgetting to bring cash
[1:42:16] on you realize ah I forgot to carry my
[1:42:21] offer
[1:42:23] but when you have it on your
[1:42:25] phone so M then just helps
[1:42:29] you you just see the code and then you
[1:42:32] just
[1:42:33] make so it will also help us on the land
[1:42:36] fund and the
[1:42:39] offerings going to we're trying to work
[1:42:41] on that with the
[1:42:44] treasury uh then also we have other ways
[1:42:48] of of sending donations like PayPal and
[1:42:51] Visa mile
[1:42:59] the Lord is
[1:43:00] good and we are going to attain this
[1:43:05] Vision it is not
[1:43:10] unattainable it is
[1:43:13] attainable if a church a small Church
[1:43:15] like
[1:43:17] this of the majority young
[1:43:22] people can raise this much money that
[1:43:25] you
[1:43:27] had and by the way most of it is raised
[1:43:29] in the past 12 months by the
[1:43:35] way so if we had started like this some
[1:43:39] two years
[1:43:40] ago we would have been very fun
[1:43:43] now someone when we started this weekly
[1:43:45] collections told
[1:43:49] me it is
[1:43:51] difficult people will give up
[1:43:54] so but you've proved them
[1:43:58] otherwise we have been
[1:44:02] consistent this is week I think
[1:44:05] 31 31
[1:44:08] right and it is
[1:44:11] consistent
[1:44:13] amen for yourselves for that
[1:44:17] amen so uh and those who have not yet
[1:44:20] come on
[1:44:21] board you are you are making us to L
[1:44:25] behind please come on board and let us
[1:44:29] do this
[1:44:30] together it is always much better when
[1:44:32] we do something
[1:44:34] together it it works
[1:44:37] faster and then we are able to attain
[1:44:39] our goals
[1:44:42] faster also Sister Rose was in
[1:44:46] in what's the name of the place
[1:44:54] I what's yes that's the
[1:44:57] one but God gave her traveling mes
[1:45:01] and Amen brother Steven told me uh
[1:45:06] there's a Sister Irene that would come
[1:45:07] here today I don't know whether she's
[1:45:08] here
[1:45:12] yet is
[1:45:14] she not
[1:45:16] yet okay so with those few words maybe
[1:45:20] we can just go to the word now
[1:45:24] this morning I want I'd like to speak to
[1:45:25] you on the subject The Thirst
[1:45:33] quencher The Thirst
[1:45:37] quen tell your neighbor the th
[1:45:42] qu
[1:45:44] amen the
[1:45:47] quen now there is a natural
[1:45:51] thir that we are born
[1:45:54] with everybody
[1:45:58] here ask your neighbor you
[1:46:02] here yes of course they can be here
[1:46:04] physically but not
[1:46:07] here so as usual I request your
[1:46:11] undivided
[1:46:16] attention uh avoid moving out if you
[1:46:20] can for most of you adults I'm sure you
[1:46:23] can stay in one place for 1 hour 1 hour
[1:46:26] and a
[1:46:29] half so please stay in one
[1:46:32] place avoid
[1:46:34] movements because it disrupts the flow
[1:46:37] of the Holy
[1:46:41] Spirit I think we've been doing good for
[1:46:43] the past several
[1:46:47] weeks and we've seen God honor us with
[1:46:50] his presence
[1:46:55] when you hon the Holy
[1:46:57] Spirit he also honors
[1:47:01] you but if you dishonor him he's very
[1:47:06] timid he's very
[1:47:09] timid he just moves away
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:25] and so do not grieve
[1:47:28] him do not grieve him when you are in a
[1:47:32] fellowship like
[1:47:34] this add on
[1:47:36] it don't take away if you do something
[1:47:40] that Grieves the
[1:47:42] spirit you are taking
[1:47:44] away even if you feel like you want to
[1:47:46] tell someone
[1:47:47] something it surely Can
[1:47:50] Wait It surely can wait until after the
[1:47:54] service is that an
[1:47:57] amen so there is a natural thirst that
[1:47:59] we are born
[1:48:02] with and every human being
[1:48:07] thirsts and we are all human being so we
[1:48:09] all
[1:48:11] thir and we are born to thir for
[1:48:15] God animals don't have a desire for God
[1:48:23] but humans uh or human beings desire
[1:48:28] God you have never seen animals making a
[1:48:31] statue or an idol to
[1:48:35] worship they have never built houses of
[1:48:40] worship there is no form of worship in
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:44] animals you know that is you know trying
[1:48:46] to actively worship
[1:48:50] something but man always wants to
[1:48:55] worship you know even if they don't know
[1:48:57] God you find that they trying to
[1:49:01] worship is humans that are building
[1:49:03] worship
[1:49:06] houses you know here in Africa we have
[1:49:08] heard like um uh in M where I grew up
[1:49:14] from for the past for the first 1 years
[1:49:17] of my
[1:49:18] life I know there is a tree
[1:49:23] called
[1:49:25] tree how many
[1:49:29] know and that tree is a large tree with
[1:49:32] Bess leaves Bess
[1:49:36] roots and so people believe that that
[1:49:39] tree was a a woman
[1:49:43] godess and and so she was moving and
[1:49:47] traversing the
[1:49:50] land and then she camped in that
[1:49:55] why because it is a a big large tree
[1:49:58] with big
[1:50:00] butress uh uh uh um you know uh branches
[1:50:03] or whatever it
[1:50:07] is so you can enter into it and you it
[1:50:11] appears as if you have entered a
[1:50:15] house and so you find many people
[1:50:17] entering
[1:50:18] there and they believe that whatever you
[1:50:21] pray there is answered
[1:50:25] and so they go with money they go with
[1:50:28] pipes they begin smoking there they
[1:50:32] begin you know doing their enchantments
[1:50:35] there and you know you find them there
[1:50:38] some of them it is as if they want to
[1:50:39] lose their
[1:50:42] mind but they're just basically
[1:50:44] worshiping a tree as
[1:50:47] a I don't know whether you are ready
[1:50:49] with those pictures by the
[1:50:52] so and so in the book of
[1:50:55] Jeremiah
[1:50:57] 10:2 the Bible says thus sayth the
[1:51:01] Lord learn not the way of the
[1:51:05] Heen and be not dismayed at the signs of
[1:51:11] Heaven for the Heen are dismayed at
[1:51:16] them for the customs of the people are
[1:51:21] vain for one cuts a tree out of the
[1:51:25] forest the work of the hands of the
[1:51:27] Workman with an
[1:51:33] axe they deck it with silver and with
[1:51:37] gold they fasten it with nails and with
[1:51:43] hammers that it move
[1:51:45] not they are upright as the palm
[1:51:50] tree but they speak
[1:51:53] not they must needs be
[1:51:56] born because they cannot
[1:52:02] go and so they have to carry
[1:52:07] it not afraid of
[1:52:13] them be not afraid of them for they
[1:52:16] cannot do
[1:52:18] evil neither also is it in them to do
[1:52:21] good
[1:52:23] you find in countries like um uh you
[1:52:26] know um
[1:52:29] India you know especially when they have
[1:52:33] floods you find these people you know
[1:52:36] very busy caring their gods on their
[1:52:40] back
[1:52:41] running you know they're trying to save
[1:52:44] their
[1:52:45] goats from the
[1:52:47] floods they trying to save their
[1:52:50] gods from the fires
[1:52:53] so we have heard those Gods also here in
[1:52:57] Africa amen I wish my sound quality can
[1:53:00] be improved we have too much noise and
[1:53:03] so we have had many of those gods in
[1:53:07] Africa and um also we have you know in
[1:53:10] India they have them in Europe they have
[1:53:14] them right now recently when they were

[1:53:32] went to the
[1:53:35] west and from the West it came here in
[1:53:40] Africa but we see now they are going
[1:53:43] back into their
[1:53:46] idolatries they going back into their
[1:53:48] ancient
[1:53:51] idolatry find

[1:54:35] woried in
[1:54:37] China you know
[1:54:40] dragons they believe it's some kind of

[1:55:12] pets okay yeah continue on continue on
[1:55:15] just keep them playing it's all right
[1:55:17] and then this is I think somewhere in

[1:55:23] you know this is
[1:55:24] z these are just Idols this
[1:55:28] is some go in in in ch in um in in
[1:55:34] India this is Buddha
[1:55:36] laughing oh give us that picture again

[1:55:41] God you know Buddha and you know they
[1:55:45] have those pictures and the sculptors
[1:55:47] and the images and the
[1:55:49] idols go back go back a little bit
[1:55:53] yes this is uh you remember how it was
[1:55:55] in the in in
[1:55:58] Egypt when they when they left Egypt the
[1:56:00] of isra free
[1:56:02] that you know and and Moses was up in
[1:56:05] the
[1:56:06] mountain you know the children of Israel
[1:56:09] they decid they kind of because Moses
[1:56:11] was not
[1:56:12] coming and they felt like they had a
[1:56:16] thirst for worshiping and so what they
[1:56:19] did they decided to collect whatever
[1:56:22] gold they
[1:56:25] had they removed all the earrings they
[1:56:28] removed all the nose Jewels they removed
[1:56:31] all the the the
[1:56:32] bracelets the Rings and whatever more
[1:56:35] they had and all the gold was brought
[1:56:40] together and they molten or they made
[1:56:43] they melted this molten
[1:56:47] C and they kind of felt now they wanted
[1:56:50] to appease that F they had
[1:56:54] their because you see they wanted to
[1:56:57] worship and so they began now they put
[1:56:59] it up there oh everybody was happy they
[1:57:03] began dancing now we have our
[1:57:07] go this
[1:57:09] car imagine people who had heard the
[1:57:13] voice of
[1:57:15] God but you see because they did not see
[1:57:18] God because they had not found that God
[1:57:22] and you know even the Bible tells us
[1:57:24] even when they went to the promised
[1:57:26] land they still did not find the rest
[1:57:29] for their
[1:57:31] soul their first was not yet
[1:57:34] qued there was still someone else that
[1:57:37] was to
[1:57:38] come that would quench their thoughts
[1:57:42] and that is Jesus and so they began
[1:57:45] worshiping come on and so we have many
[1:57:48] others you know the the the the Indians
[1:57:51] I think this is IND
[1:57:55] and and you know it's just some kind of
[1:57:58] funny
[1:57:59] looking you know
[1:58:03] mold but they kind of believe that that
[1:58:06] is their
[1:58:07] God if they had me talk about it that
[1:58:10] way they would say you blaspheming our
[1:58:13] God but you see this is just an
[1:58:17] idol continue
[1:58:19] on this is z the ancient god of Greek of
[1:58:24] the
[1:58:25] Greeks it's just an idol continue
[1:58:29] on yeah yeah just let it play Let It
[1:58:33] play give us more of that yes this is
[1:58:36] China somewhere they have many gods in
[1:58:40] China many gods in
[1:58:42] China
[1:58:45] continue yeah you remember this image of
[1:58:49] Nebuchadnezzar you know how he put it up
[1:58:53] there you know it was having a
[1:58:56] message speaking of what God would
[1:58:58] do talking about the gentle
[1:59:01] kingdoms out of the dream he had but the
[1:59:05] man decided to make an image out of
[1:59:08] it and he told everybody to bow to
[1:59:11] it but only three refused to
[1:59:15] Bow that's why the Bible says learn not
[1:59:17] the way of the
[1:59:20] Heathen we may be in the
[1:59:25] world where you know we we are
[1:59:27] surrounded by
[1:59:29] heavens and everybody is worshiping
[1:59:31] certain
[1:59:32] things everybody is worshiping certain
[1:59:36] Spirits everybody is worshiping certain
[1:59:38] images and
[1:59:40] Idol but we should be like these three
[1:59:43] brothers we will not we should not bow
[1:59:47] we should not B because for us we have
[1:59:49] only one God and his name is Jesus
[1:59:53] Christ that is the only God we shall
[1:59:56] worship that is the only God We Shall
[1:59:59] Serve amen the Bible told us not to
[2:00:02] learn the way of the
[2:00:06] Heen all right so he was you know why
[2:00:10] does man do all these
[2:00:13] things because man was made a living
[2:00:17] Soul he has always desired to know the
[2:00:20] Creator
[2:00:23] man has always looked for ways to enjoy
[2:00:25] life to its
[2:00:28] fullest you always feel like you want to
[2:00:31] enjoy
[2:00:32] life you want to fly you want to go
[2:00:36] higher you know you want to enjoy you
[2:00:39] want to discover
[2:00:41] life and you know it's it's a
[2:00:44] thirst that God has placed within our
[2:00:47] heart each of us have
[2:00:50] it in the message in for life and I
[2:00:52] would read many quotes out of
[2:00:55] that the prophet would say and as I
[2:00:57] stood back you know he had come from
[2:01:01] preaching and he was very tired and so
[2:01:04] he you know was retiring to go in a
[2:01:06] hotel room and
[2:01:09] rest and so now he narrates what he
[2:01:13] saw what he experienced there at that
[2:01:16] hotel and and you know many of us like
[2:01:19] you know preachers that travel
[2:01:22] we see a lot of these things we are
[2:01:25] really living in this kind of
[2:01:27] world where are many people are
[2:01:32] worshiping Idols other gods spirits and
[2:01:37] we are surrounded by
[2:01:39] them but we should never allow the world
[2:01:41] to influence
[2:01:43] us into worshiping the gods they
[2:01:47] worship the Bible says we are royal
[2:01:49] priesthood
[2:01:53] a holy
[2:01:54] nation we should be
[2:01:57] different because we are made to be
[2:02:01] different because we have found the one
[2:02:04] that can quench our
[2:02:08] thoughts and soam
[2:02:11] narrates and he says you listen to this
[2:02:14] story he says and as I stood back in the
[2:02:19] shadow they were most you know these
[2:02:21] people were coming running up and down
[2:02:23] they were most too
[2:02:27] drunk they were so they were too drunk
[2:02:31] to recognize me standing
[2:02:33] there they came by lovely looking
[2:02:38] women and men pulling them to the
[2:02:42] rooms and the other men fasting about
[2:02:46] them I noticed as one passed
[2:02:50] by she stopped
[2:02:52] and she taken a big drink from the
[2:02:57] bottle you know as they were just moving
[2:03:00] around and you know they were carrying
[2:03:02] on as usual so she stopped and pulled a
[2:03:05] drink and took a big
[2:03:09] seep a
[2:03:11] woman and handed it over to the other
[2:03:14] one and and and they made some kind of a
[2:03:17] real dirty smarty remark
[2:03:23] and she said
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:28] who this
[2:03:32] is you know I don't know whether some of
[2:03:34] you have been
[2:03:36] there but those people who are there
[2:03:38] they think that is
[2:03:41] life they think they have joy they think
[2:03:44] they happy but you see this oh my God
[2:03:48] these people are
[2:03:50] thirsty listen listen to what the
[2:03:52] prophet of God says about this and so
[2:03:55] she said o this is
[2:03:57] life I thought how mistaken you
[2:04:02] already that is
[2:04:05] death the Bible say the woman that lives
[2:04:08] in
[2:04:10] pleasure is dead while she
[2:04:17] ising how the devil has made people
[2:04:20] believe that that was like
[2:04:24] some people think they
[2:04:27] smoking
[2:04:29] gambling
[2:04:31] drinking
[2:04:33] reveiling his life by the way I was just
[2:04:37] trying to look up the meaning of the
[2:04:38] word reveiling or ring I don't know if
[2:04:40] that's the right
[2:04:42] pronunciation and listen to what it
[2:04:44] means because the Bible also speaks of
[2:04:47] it it means to celebrate
[2:04:52] to
[2:04:53] enjoy the action of participating in
[2:04:56] Lively and noisy
[2:05:03] festivities especially involving
[2:05:05] drinking and
[2:05:09] dancing you know those kind of things
[2:05:11] that make people
[2:05:14] excited you know enjoying they think
[2:05:16] they're enjoying they are
[2:05:18] celebrating that's why you never find
[2:05:20] people drinking alcohol having a party
[2:05:22] when they are
[2:05:26] sad they think they're so
[2:05:28] happy and so they are always
[2:05:31] shouting and all
[2:05:35] Party
[2:05:37] enjy come on God come
[2:05:41] on begin
[2:05:44] drinking they
[2:05:46] sh oh you want some
[2:05:53] that's
[2:05:59] Ring says that is
[2:06:03] death a perverted life it is not life it
[2:06:08] cannot be life that kind of a life
[2:06:11] becomes so
[2:06:14] miserable to many times people take a
[2:06:18] gun or something and read themselves of
[2:06:21] that
[2:06:24] life so that could not be the kind of
[2:06:26] life that the psalmist was speaking
[2:06:30] of when he was saying that loving
[2:06:33] kindness is better than life to
[2:06:36] me but this is not the kind of
[2:06:39] life that David was speaking about but
[2:06:43] this is the kind of Life the world is
[2:06:45] offering our younger
[2:06:49] generation and they think it is life
[2:06:52] but it is not life my brother it is
[2:06:56] death because in the end they end up
[2:07:00] becoming
[2:07:01] depressed they end up becoming so
[2:07:04] sad they end up getting a
[2:07:08] hangover and they go into
[2:07:10] drugs and they begin they many of them
[2:07:13] shoot
[2:07:14] themselves and take themselves out of
[2:07:17] that kind of life and they go straight
[2:07:20] to hell
[2:07:23] and says and I
[2:07:24] thought then what makes people do
[2:07:29] that how come that men and women will do
[2:07:32] those
[2:07:34] things then I thought
[2:07:36] this God created man to thirst for
[2:07:43] life these people do these things
[2:07:45] because they're thirsting for
[2:07:49] life can you imagine a prophet would
[2:07:52] tell us these people are doing these
[2:07:53] things because they're thirsting for
[2:07:56] life and any of you before you get
[2:08:00] life you can actually also have these
[2:08:04] thir that thir that is in you is a
[2:08:07] creation of
[2:08:10] God you see you find these women pulling
[2:08:13] these men pulling them into their
[2:08:17] rooms living in
[2:08:19] immorality thinking and part
[2:08:22] and think they enjoying
[2:08:25] life smoking and gambling you know why
[2:08:29] do they have these
[2:08:32] Appetit it is because they have a
[2:08:35] thirst a thirst for
[2:08:38] life but they've not yet been
[2:08:41] quenched they still have that s and they
[2:08:45] will have it until they find the amen
[2:08:47] the th quen
[2:08:53] and so the prophet said why do they do
[2:08:56] that how come that men and women will do
[2:08:59] these
[2:09:01] things then I S this God created man to
[2:09:05] thirst for
[2:09:07] life that that is in
[2:09:10] you is a creation of
[2:09:13] God tell your neighbor that th is the
[2:09:16] creation of
[2:09:18] God and right and wrong is said before
[2:09:21] for
[2:09:23] you as a tree of life and death in the
[2:09:27] garden of
[2:09:28] aen and God Made You to
[2:09:32] thirst and how dare you take that
[2:09:34] blessed
[2:09:37] thirst that God has put in
[2:09:40] you thir after
[2:09:42] him and you try to quench it with the
[2:09:45] things of the
[2:09:48] world the devil is trying to make men
[2:09:50] and women run run the night
[2:09:55] clubs they are running the night
[2:09:59] clubs
[2:10:00] parties and live
[2:10:03] immorally because they are
[2:10:06] thirsting and that thirst is in you is
[2:10:08] of
[2:10:10] god and it will never be
[2:10:15] satisfied until
[2:10:17] Christ that
[2:10:19] Fountain the fountain of Life fills your
[2:10:25] soul until you receive
[2:10:27] him by the way of the Holy
[2:10:31] Spirit your thir will never
[2:10:35] be it is totally
[2:10:37] impossible the devil will make you
[2:10:39] believe that you are
[2:10:42] living but you are
[2:10:44] dead in sin and in
[2:10:48] trespasses God is the only thirster
[2:10:52] that will satisfy that longing in
[2:10:55] you I told you there's a time I I I I
[2:10:58] had a thirst I didn't even know I was a
[2:11:03] child and made for myself a
[2:11:07] cigarette and I put fire on
[2:11:10] it and I started you know smoking
[2:11:13] it and you know it's the closest I ever
[2:11:16] came to
[2:11:17] smoking I began coughing and coughing
[2:11:20] and coughing
[2:11:22] and then I realized the thing was not
[2:11:24] good but you see that thirst what made
[2:11:27] me smoke that
[2:11:29] paper it was because I had a f in
[2:11:33] me I did not know who would quench that
[2:11:37] fast but when I Found
[2:11:39] Jesus amen
[2:11:42] the when I found him the Fountain of
[2:11:47] Life he quenched my thirst in my soul
[2:11:52] you can't give me a cigarette now
[2:11:55] because I don't have a thir for
[2:12:00] it there is no one that will quench your
[2:12:03] thirst and everything you are doing
[2:12:05] can't quench your
[2:12:07] thirst until you find
[2:12:10] him Christ the Fountain of
[2:12:16] Life last night he says when I was going
[2:12:19] into the hotel
[2:12:22] I know this two nice young
[2:12:25] ladies as wife and I were walking
[2:12:29] in beautiful young
[2:12:33] girl somebody's
[2:12:36] daring some mother and father maybe
[2:12:39] maybe little old dad had sweated hard to
[2:12:42] feed them and they were dressed very
[2:12:51] and as they went into the
[2:12:53] door they entered to the right to a
[2:12:57] little
[2:12:59] bar dingy
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:03] dark with cigarette
[2:13:07] smoke and whisky
[2:13:11] fumes coming from
[2:13:14] that I thought
[2:13:16] oh you walking into the Jo of hell
[2:13:21] into the Jo of death you may defer with
[2:13:25] me you may say that's just an old
[2:13:29] F and I've seen also many young
[2:13:31] people who when you tell them these
[2:13:34] things they tell you you just from
[2:13:36] another
[2:13:37] generation they don't even realize it is
[2:13:40] not about the generation you are coming
[2:13:43] from it's about the S you
[2:13:46] have theen of
[2:13:51] matter which
[2:13:52] generation people have been thirsting
[2:13:54] from the very
[2:13:56] beginning years and years before you
[2:13:58] were
[2:13:59] Bor but each person that
[2:14:02] found the
[2:14:04] thiren was
[2:14:07] satisfied and they never went back again
[2:14:09] into those
[2:14:11] things and so you might say well you are
[2:14:13] just an old
[2:14:15] foggy but my friend in the end of this
[2:14:19] life you find out that that is the
[2:14:23] truth it is death to enter into
[2:14:27] that it is death to enter into that
[2:14:32] bur to go into and begin taking
[2:14:36] whiskey it is D to begin taking
[2:14:40] cigarettes it
[2:14:43] is you are trying to satisfy a
[2:14:46] hunger you are trying to satisfy a
[2:14:49] thirst with the things of the world and
[2:14:52] thus th was not was not given to you to
[2:14:55] be quenched by the things of the
[2:15:00] world it was given to you by
[2:15:03] God to be satisfied and quenched by
[2:15:08] Christ the inexhaustable
[2:15:11] Fountain of
[2:15:16] Life when you try to satisfy that with
[2:15:19] with with that perverted
[2:15:24] tomorrow you wake up with a
[2:15:26] headache with a
[2:15:29] heart and you live
[2:15:32] immorally you've got to face the world
[2:15:34] with a scar on you for the rest of your
[2:15:41] life you only get death by doing
[2:15:45] so by trying something else out of
[2:15:48] Christ
[2:15:51] y that craving in your
[2:15:54] heart you will only get
[2:15:58] death and the prophet says let me invite
[2:16:01] you to a fountain that's open in the
[2:16:04] house of
[2:16:06] God a smitten
[2:16:09] rock that lifegiving
[2:16:11] water came out of it Jesus invites
[2:16:16] everyone he says whoever will
[2:16:19] come let him
[2:16:21] come and quench their
[2:16:24] fast they will never fast
[2:16:27] again what a promise that
[2:16:30] is sometimes we have a religious
[2:16:34] th you know you end up with as much
[2:16:36] hypocrisy in your
[2:16:40] life sometimes worse than even going to
[2:16:42] the
[2:16:45] barroom you are in church people
[2:16:48] sometimes will come so close to the
[2:16:53] Fountain they will be in church in a
[2:16:56] message
[2:16:57] church but they will refuse to drink
[2:17:00] from that
[2:17:02] F right in the middle of God changing
[2:17:07] lives people will come up give
[2:17:11] testimonies I was an immortal person God
[2:17:14] changed my life I was a drunk God Chang
[2:17:17] my life
[2:17:21] was lustful God changed my life but
[2:17:24] right in the middle of God doing this
[2:17:28] things people will sit right there and
[2:17:31] they will
[2:17:32] refuse to drink from that
[2:17:36] Fountain when God is very
[2:17:39] busy doing wonders and the
[2:17:42] Miracles right under the
[2:17:44] fountain and they die and
[2:17:48] rot we have many of those
[2:17:51] in our
[2:17:52] churches in church that's why even the
[2:17:55] people of the world
[2:17:57] sometimes they would tell you I am
[2:18:00] better off an
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:02] unbeliever than being a
[2:18:05] hypocrite because they have thought that
[2:18:08] every Church person is a
[2:18:11] hypocrite but I tell you brother not
[2:18:13] every Church person is a
[2:18:16] hypocrite if you a hypocrite don't think
[2:18:18] everybody is
[2:18:21] you are a hypocrite because you couldn't
[2:18:23] or you have refused to drink from
[2:18:26] that but whoever drinks from that
[2:18:30] Fountain God changes them and he
[2:18:33] quenches that fast for the things of the
[2:18:36] world that they used to
[2:18:38] do in a message how can I overcome he
[2:18:41] says I was crossing an Old Log the other
[2:18:47] day down I wash
[2:18:50] or what is called a
[2:18:54] hollow and I jumped up on this
[2:18:58] log on the
[2:19:00] outside it looked good it looked like a
[2:19:04] big old beach
[2:19:08] log but when I jumped on
[2:19:11] it oh a great chunk of it fell
[2:19:15] off it was real
[2:19:18] rotten and dirty I say that's the way
[2:19:22] the Christians are
[2:19:25] becoming they've been dead in sin and
[2:19:29] trespasses so long till they become
[2:19:32] dirty dirty means to be socked and soft
[2:19:34] and
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:42] spongy yes yes that's the right they can
[2:19:44] hold no weight at
[2:19:46] all they don't know what what even
[2:19:49] overcoming
[2:19:52] means I begin to think of this text
[2:19:55] then
[2:19:57] overcome keep life in you when life went
[2:20:03] out that's what brought that log to that
[2:20:08] condition and it made it so
[2:20:11] worse than
[2:20:14] ever when it laid in the branch where
[2:20:17] the water was
[2:20:19] [Music]
[2:20:24] and then there you take a
[2:20:26] Christian that is supposed to be a
[2:20:28] Christian let the life of God go from
[2:20:32] him and the experience the joy of
[2:20:35] serving Christ and living in a church
[2:20:40] where such is going
[2:20:41] on he Rens twice as
[2:20:47] quick living in the church
[2:20:51] but what happens because that Joy of
[2:20:53] serving
[2:20:55] Christ that experience has left
[2:21:00] them the life is no longer in but they
[2:21:04] in church but they will R
[2:21:07] fast than even the ones who are in the
[2:21:10] B so if we are trying to follow the
[2:21:12] message of the
[2:21:14] hour or at least this part of the
[2:21:17] message we should live constantly in the
[2:21:21] Life of
[2:21:23] Christ because if you don't you lay
[2:21:29] around and know that these things that
[2:21:31] you are supposed to
[2:21:34] do and you don't do it the Bible said he
[2:21:38] that knoweth to do
[2:21:41] good and do it not to him it is
[2:21:47] sin then you become dirty
[2:21:51] you become
[2:21:53] rotten when you are separated from the
[2:21:55] life of
[2:21:56] God so you strive with all that is in
[2:22:01] you to stay in the Life of
[2:22:04] Christ every one of us should strive
[2:22:07] with everything in
[2:22:08] us with everything in us to live in the
[2:22:12] Life of
[2:22:14] Christ whatever the word
[2:22:16] says within your soul
[2:22:21] that you may be fit
[2:22:23] bearing in John
[2:22:26] 46 the Bible says Jacob's Well was
[2:22:29] there Jesus being worried with his
[2:22:33] journey sat on the well and it was about
[2:22:37] the 60th
[2:22:38] house there come a woman of
[2:22:41] Samaria to draw water Jesus said unto
[2:22:45] her give me to
[2:22:47] drink Jesus engages this woman
[2:22:51] in a
[2:22:52] conversation he wants to engage you in a
[2:22:54] conversation this
[2:22:57] morning all the other men that she had
[2:23:01] met they had engaged her in a
[2:23:05] conversation for the wrong
[2:23:08] reasons and the reasons they had
[2:23:10] in was to perpetuate that
[2:23:14] fast that was in
[2:23:19] her to try and pet
[2:23:22] it to try and satisfy and
[2:23:25] gratify but Jesus the
[2:23:29] thiren was the only
[2:23:32] man who could offer her
[2:23:36] something something that could qu
[2:23:40] that once and for
[2:23:43] [Music]
[2:23:45] all verse 10 says Jesus answered and
[2:23:47] said unto
[2:23:48] her if thou knowest the gift of
[2:23:52] God and who it is that sayth to thee
[2:23:56] give me to drink thou would would have
[2:24:00] asked of
[2:24:01] him and he would have given the Living
[2:24:05] Water Jesus told this woman you just
[2:24:08] don't know who he's talking
[2:24:10] to but if you knew who he was you would
[2:24:14] have asked him give me to
[2:24:18] drink if you knew
[2:24:22] who you were talking to whenever you
[2:24:25] come in
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:28] church oh if you could only come to the
[2:24:30] house of

[2:31:22] in sin because you
[2:31:24] are

[2:33:12] thirst Jesus said unto
[2:33:15] her go call me your husband
[2:33:20] it sounded
[2:33:24] random because she had opened her

[2:33:30] straight to where the problem
[2:33:35] was he says call your husband and come

[2:34:42] disgraced she was so
[2:34:45] asham she was in this
[2:34:47] condition because she was thir

[2:35:07] she was a predestinated seed
[2:35:12] of and that
[2:35:14] seed in her was calling for expression
[2:35:21] was calling for
[2:35:24] expression every time it would
