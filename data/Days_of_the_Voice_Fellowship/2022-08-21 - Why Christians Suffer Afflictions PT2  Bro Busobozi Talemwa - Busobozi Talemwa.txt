of jesus christ sometimes you feel like being in his presence [Music] foreign psalms 34 verse 19. and i think i'll give the announcements at the end of the service i don't want to break the atmosphere i mean let us read verse 19. many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers him out of them all everyone knows the writers cry and the lord heareth and delivers them out oh [Music] i would like to take this opportunity to greet each and every one of you in the jewish name of jesus and uh we are happy this morning to be with sister peace from sri lanka god bless you come on come on nice to see you after a very long time and uh i see another young lady i do not think i know foreign oh god bless you amen she's the wife of our acting deacon here oh yo mucha allah to welcome brother peter and who have also moved in this area amen mean praise the name of the lord come here and i had a brother who is visiting with us god bless you too thank you come on come on everybody protect us hallelujah on sunday my my mother here had a testimony i don't know where i'm going yes let us give a testimony these things encourage the church the commandment would you [Music] i thank god more so for the gift of life and i thank god for hearing my prayers brethren i have the testimony but sometimes i give even when i don't have and then god gives me back hey i had the testimony that i was preparing to buy land and build i came and i told god that i was planning to build but let me give you my money so that you will also give me back we started gathering money in zana in much pain i could give everything i had uganda brethren who are seeing me thought that i have a lot wondering who are you because i was the biggest giver but i had i had i was i had i was in a covenant with god we are still constructing even before reaching the middle and god had already finished my house me i didn't know that as i was building for gold they were building for me they called me and said mama come on and they give me my home but whenever after this then that was a mighty testimony brethren you know how my home looks i am not the one who built that home it is go to build it but i never stopped to come before the house of god to tell god i also pray make a way for me that i will serve you better now the brother came and picked money and bought chairs in the first time transport that day i didn't even have money to take me back home i remember when the mobile money person was withdrawing the money i told her please ah top up on that money 100 000. and i gave brother anger and he bought the chairs even the next time i called him and i told him come and pick money and i gave him money to buy chairs during those days when we are working and we probably understand what is going on in town it has been since five months four months ago i've been having daily consecutive dreams when i'm dreaming traveling somewhere and in that dream as i would be moving when i would reach in the middle of the journey one of my children could come and give me a lift and take me to the end and i would ask god what is the meaning of this message i couldn't understand it i started telling my children through messages that i'm done with town i'm going back home one of my sons told me finalize everything i'm going to give you all the money you will confess in your mouth that you need water i will give you that money and you begin doing what you want i finalized everything i was doing is like a message and they sent me an a a blank check in the message how much money do you want oh my god i told him that i want 130 millions and he got 130 millions and gave them to me on my account i have not closed the previous business and i'm having a new business tanzania i went to tanzania i have my driver he's there they said i'm going to take you to tanzania you buy rice in here we went to tanzania we bro we bought a trailer of rice carrying 1060 bags of rice 117 millions in a hard cash we even paid the taxes of four million transport media on a billionaire even transport 2.5 million we even paid the workers 500 thousands i don't know what i can tell you never break out i thank the grace of god for good words the rice but the market is still unstable and even customers are not yet aware of our product but we believe the lord who has done this will do the rest those are the miracles that god have done for me this is he has done that not in a church which tells us to sow seeds but in a church which they listen which preaches to us the word of god hallelujah hallelujah what god has done for others he can do for you we have a god that never fails and a god that keeps all his appointments i told you when we were beginning to collect our land funds that priorities and he will do the same for you so i encourage you to continue doing the same but i was called delivered our god provide cause our god don't think it is someone's testimony can as well be your testimony may even be different what is the same god amen so now this morning i would like us to ask ourselves a question why do christians suffer afflictions do christians suffer afflictions do we go through temptation so do it anymore we came up yes but why shouldn't our life be well and it is very appropriate that we have had a testimony this morning i think and she said that you should not change anymore what would he do with judaism because now sister rose can say i know man i know that's my redeemer and i know many are the afflictions of the righteous but the law delivers him out of them so now the first we talked about on wednesday is that god allows us to go through suffering so that he can make his attributes known to us he wants his attributes to be known to us quickly return to your body goes to the book of revelation chapter 2 verse 8 praise the name of the lord yet i'm coming here amen and then and i always try to be not a lengthy preacher so if you can support me and preach together with me then i can try to be as brief as possible and then all of us will be blessed i wanna finish and i'm to the edge of the church in samana right this thing says the first and the last which was dead and is alive [Music] [Music] oh and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say that they are jews and are not but at the synagogue of saturn shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that he may be tried and he shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life [Music] what the spirit of satan to the churches he that overcometh shall not be heart of the second death i you know there were ministers of the message who were arrested in china some years ago church one way can you say 2137 they do not uh preach even publicly also it's the only church which is allowed by the state you can say okay and then the other churches they do underground church one day when i was in one of these cities i think i was in shenzhen not even saying i had we had gone to visit a factory tried it against a child in accordance and then as we entered into the the factory 23 indirect everybody was working people were busy and then i noticed that there was uh this man came and pushed something [Music] and so we went and uh we were preaching on that i think it was about the 10th floor and it was in a believer's home and we had a knock on the door and i was preaching in english and brother ivan was inter preaching to me for me into chinese and as i was preaching we you take care we had our bibles in a bible is the faith you know it's not allowed to do that the chicken is what you call them even allowed to have bibles so those will be taken as exhibits and so um the brother froze was interpreted the whole people froze university come on froze so we did not know what to do next and no one had the guts to go and open the door but one brother you know kind of gathered the gaps and he was he was going to go and open me up so if i'm going to be killed or arrested remember let them take me because when i am doing when i'm on my post of duty if i told this brother let us continue preaching let them end and find us preaching friend that took this hallelujah amen and we preached on it don't tell me what happened next i don't know what happened because nobody came together when the brother opened there you know was telling them of what he knows about them i know you're suffering i know you are affliction i even know that some of you are poor many believers think that when you become a christian god simply takes away your troubles everything becomes fine everything [Music] says i'm sailing and sailing going to heaven you know they think that christianity is a sailing process reality is not the sailing of christianity is filled with afflictions it's filled with the trouble look you dammit i wanna know it is filled with a stumbling block lose your damage it is filled without hurdles i'll just be done in one hour so just follow me closely i'm not done with the subject i'll just cut it and continue on wednesdays now listen now the lord god almighty says i know money there's somebody i know i wanted money there he is working in the middle east of his [Applause] [Music] let me tell you god is mindful about each of his children he can say that underwear because our god does not sleep he does not slam down together he is always there even in your hardest of trials and this is a stumbling block to so many people on wednesday we read in malachi 1 1 1 2 3. [Music] when the children say nature how come that you say you love us you know that jews have been even taken into concentration camps do you know there is no nation there is no people there is no tribe there is no clan on ah that has suffered like the jews did you know that oh my gosh money they have suffered more than any other tribe when you're singing but yes it is the only drive you change you catch your car they are the only people that are the only nation that has never been annihilated all the others the kingdoms when they fall they fall forever and some of them even their history is gone with them in the history of the world there is no nation that has ever failed and came back again because there was a purpose of god for them [Music] is [Music] in him praise the name of the lord you see they could not figure out god islam they thought that love meant no suffering they leave your things in the chair you see people think that god is love come up here oh little oh even you know oh that our god is a white king i don't know what's he cannot come against he's a white father he is rich but he does not want us to be spoiled and he according to his rules god said god loves you hallelujah amen if god chose you understand god no matter what you have gone through no matter what the devil has done no matter the suffering just to know one thing god loves you amen i mean never fear allah [Applause] because we rejoice in his election quran there are many millions in the world why do you look at them not all of them have heard this message i have seen people know that only those that god hallelujah hallelujah god has more confidence in you than your faith and no questions you think you will not make it otherwise my god if it had [Music] that no matter what happened since sometime his love was proven truly by the fact to serve by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation oh oh everything is all right so how is your relationship with him oh some of you don't care to be of god but let me tell you you are a friend of god to to reap very many benefits out of it we don't do anything we do to become safe what we need for our salvation was done by jesus you don't dress the way you dress to become saved brother you don't cut your hair to be saved the things we do an integrative collaboration use them to appreciate is his what for us we do it because we love him hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah my sister if you're not married and you'll find mercy before one brother and he marries you now if jesus yes had mercy on us you have to serve siddha and he married us nothing was sad his wife but truly this brother organ makes the first move [Music] now i will take this one doctor and then when he comes to you he comes with an application a giant sympathy servant he comes to the proposal now it is up to you to accept him not to refuse it and it is so sad but many tragedies are refusing christ [Music] for life what listen to me if the woman is wise [Music] the bible says she will rebuild her house i've just seen by mccarthy right secondly in the book of proverbs people can see and what is going to happen she will lose the favor of will not he [Music] and you find that someone else may be or less the bible says without faith it is impossible to please god but someone can send you sacramento hallelujah how do you please god i'm taking him at his wife everything is saying go ahead and do it go ahead and do it we don't do what we do to be safe they took hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord come here so let us carry on here katrina so he may commit you to anything amen for suffering makes us to be strengthened good food established hallelujah hallelujah a you see when he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered obedience by the things which is suffering and he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did they want [Applause] [Music] your the tree is not becoming softer if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i recall that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us [Music] [Applause] you know let me tell you something we have people called gold diggers today now then to our simi bazaar yeah i think that should have a phrase in uganda touring abandoned i've known every you know these people don't know they do not want to go through suffering but they want to get the benefits of suffering and maybe you know they are now rich and half goods are increased in other things of the world i think this one would be good for me and she goes in again and of course the man will lie to her you see i don't know i'm really embarrassed my wife let me talk about this because we have a lot of young people here they can be okay do you know they don't want to get married to younger men what what are their uh list of needs a man who is handsome from your own but now where [Music] they know where they they were there together they were using bathrooms that do not have even cement together are you are you are you following me yeah we're together together [Applause] forever [Music] now jesus yes he is also a wise man yes i'm against he doesn't want to marry a sex queen or a modern [Applause] body name meanwhile as if it is that of a vampire vampire full of red things good today i have to talk about this thing pinocchio getting cruel in the church mechanism your brother's going to spend time in the mirror for a long time we don't want no sisters here to talk about that you want to look i mean spend time in the mirror with them underground look at yourself let me wait a little bit let anymore [Music] what you know you should look like a baboon and get sick you find women very uncomfortable the devil is really imprisoning them you haven't seen them on camera i even have one that the man who made them how do they really oh my gosh without them anymore she can't even lick it that's the devil is giving them a bad and oh and amen there oh my god hallelujah do you know that even jesus your skin was of a dark complexion [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] amen why because jesus rose again let me tell you he died for me he was [Applause] you are hallelujah unless you suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is character simply is never made without suffering praise the name of the lord amen that's why i believe that whatever it is [Music] oh [Music] that's why we should never want to be like somebody else what somebody else has gone through to become who they are is not what you're going through and if you want to be like someone else then you must go through what [Music] i want this what is mine now come and get a vienna lord prepare me come and take care of your sanctuary for you you are me don't prepare me like somebody else that's what i've been vocal about our president and i've never actually voted in my life i voted once for christ yes the other time the inter-religious council and other councils of religion they were trying to put pressure on him can you grow ban those little churches can you show and when the president came president we had to respond to them reported them the bible and he said i don't see where peter went for theology we have them in history to my name we have fire there is no leader tell him korean then say that god has not put caton praise the name of the lord come here praise the name of the lord [Music] is do i'm your next king by the way i am the one you would sit there to try and rob their confidence if god wanted him to be a king you wouldn't even have to do that hallelujah amen what i'm saying it's not your efforts for you to be anything in this life that you see in the command you go is and this opportunity [Music] [Music] need you pick out no that two million millions do you even give it to that condemnation god bless you guys this is god this money because the holy spirit just reminded me of something which i've been trying to run away from but he's telling me to share it with you i was in ethiopia one day and there was some brothers coming from from canada some place and but the biscuit told me of them brother and his wife and they were coming from tanzania by their tanzania and they were going to back home and so europe is the main half of most of these um flights ethiopia [Music] um uh for a few hours and at that moment the brother contacted me and said we've landed and if you could just come at the airport and meet with us and so when we arrived there too um long story short he was not allowed to enter because this is now like the main gate going to the to canada to the states so they don't allow people to enter actually the departure gate if you don't have a ticket again and so but i found my way through i had this coffee i bought for the brother and um the coffee and everything else so i left him with everything and i left again and when i entered there all the mothers met me and i met them scared are you are you flying oh i said no no so how did you come here i said i was permitted to come to my friends and uh i was just praying oh god let that man

he said no i can't you are going to be here the whole night again because what you did was criminals we are still making investigations and i knew from there car in the parking lot waiting for me to come back in given means and at that moment i knew what this man wanted me on a chair she wanted a bribe because it's a foreigner me [Music] now not take any money and actually you can go again why did you wait until that moment god was taking me through something and what i learned there it has carried me all through my life to trust god during suffering he gave champion now i can stand and testify and i can instruct you i know money and maybe the holy spirit is dealing with someone here woman okay for you to learn to trust i'm rather god knows us better than we know ourselves catholic singapore and he says i know what you're going through i know money you may think no one cares no one knows no one understands the loser but god says i know i understand you better than you understand yourself protected i want you to know i am dependable i wanted to get into your soul remember you can rely on yourself on me i will always answer your and that's why it says love to god you want to

about get about ready to get to where she works [Music] the next time she goes there the lord you will bless the work of my hands [Music] bless that business [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] after the [Music] is you hello [Music] may my spirit [Music] my [Applause] [Music] as the [Music] daddy you are lonely [Music] for just a moment [Music] [Music] i just wanted to update you but again what to do says been a while without updating you because i know most of us have so i'm not surprised that there is not much contributions in the past to so we uh pledged about three point five twelve million building h2o but not all of it has been fulfilled and i really want to say god bless you for your contribution okay i don't think i need to read names you know yourselves i think one brother will call each of you and remind you to fulfill your pledges because remember those pledges that you met was the renter of this place frank said fortune was for the initial six months and we already paid it because we took it from our land fund and that was this sentence and so you need to pay it back so that you can be taken back and send us a 120 so whatever i will announce as the land fund does not mean we have it is the tucker city now until you fulfill all your places you understand that so uh so that means it is short of 959 pounds but also when we when we arrived here between fortuna there was was no doors and we had to put in these doors both of them emiliano even trivial because they said what but after inserting them in the building but while they tell me we agreed with the owner that it will all be counted as part of our rent is so there is more money we have spent than you promised to give catholic center is a singapore is the two was there to spend these things yes so i do not have the the details here every single moment that is because brother you give me your report but the martin he did not give me yours been waiting for this year we have paid a total of 10 months 11. i think 11 11 months ago we will not need to look for rent the children know you're saying but uh you will need to contribute for the money of the four how many more months is it because they had promised six months but then we paid for eleven so how many more months five so that and that is eight each month is five hundred thousand whereas our time for five months how much is that money is no 2.5 million building h2 so we need 2.5 plus this about a million so that's about uh 3.5 knows of cutting up certain h2 to put back on our landfans we are in debt of 3.5 million which has been spent towards our rental for this sentence now in addition you see this place is beautiful like this and you know we came without two speakers here and obviously and when the brothers plugged it in it would not make any sound the room was empty so we noticed we needed more speakers we were able to get the best speakers and the the this one is called the monitor monitor we need another monitor and also some other brothers help me what is the names of those crossover program an amplifier and a crossover give someone a microphone there let them explain to the church what do those things do is so you must explain to us in a way that after you have explained to us we can be able to pray for them god bless you change when we come in this place we are able to buy one we're able to buy two more things here one of you maybe apart from this what jacob is in that age so we bought new amplifier we had one two arduino amplifiers yeah but it was weak so this one is more powerful the sound from the from the base crossover area because these speakers they're not supposed to receive this area because if they receive best they will they get support so this is supposed to go [Music] yes so it sends the best there under the sound again again then on top of this we added this god bless yeah god bless you church everybody is giving a report on what he worked on hey wait what do you wanna know when we came here there was darkness inside here at anyway walk underground here which you don't see what are the next features and the sutures and then what wanna uh and then there is somebody who helped us out so s and center that was a sign the money was spent [Music] it was 101 million 100 1 million one million one fifty thousand yeah so i spoke to the pastor and sent pictures of w editor we need the lights which don't bring shadows but we found one light like [Music] another life also the light on the pulpit that was streaming when you look at our services online you really see the lighting is still lacking come about god bless you so brother martin worked on the you know he's a technician visible so now we appreciate god for brother marty amen and he worked on the lights and he has explained it all having you on your deviantart and uh that costed about it costed one million one fifty thousand yeah millionaire done and we've spent inside yeah and then now it is on you to pray that the lord will provide to you so you can contribute [Music] you want someone else to take that blessing alone they will it's my blessing to give that receipt total of i'm i have a problem with my figure here i don't know was it 2.3 or 3.2 you do not see okay all right so i i think it is uh 3.3 million million a missing brother we have a new debut my medium is set to make me try that if i made a mistake and i've added one million i'll correct it in the next segment and uh also there are other things that we have worked here what would they be interpreted here and uh that's the carpeting capacity amen come in uh i believe jesus is clean yes and they invite him to worship to him it should also be created so um and we failed to do all these because we are going to be here for a little while to be correct yes as we are we are concluding with our contributions for the land once we have settled all our debts here again back towards our land contribution and so i want him to give us a report also i know you gave me the financial report but tell us absolutely uh foreign [Music] foreign okay okay so you need to add that on the one point six once to come up foreign this curtain and timbers you know was designed most but all these things were done by believers i think 90 percent believers was done by a sister miracle i know most of you know her manina miracle you have to take care of timbers you know mr miracle we know her because she was the one that i think she did the hairdressing of my wife on her wedding money man and brothers so it was my choice but uh i believe it will serve us and honestly brother martin unless you remind me i do not remember how much it was much an imposing one because that's duke is the same yes it includes everything how much total force now we i don't know if i've forgotten anything yeah these flowers were just my gift every morning [Music] for your glory has come amen all right god bless you come on come to your sister so sister this is your responsibility if they look ugly so so of course this because the outer was ending all right so if you said it looks good then give a clap of praise but i think that one we can always take it upon ourselves maybe enough now there is also a need to go the piano and the piano the one that we want to buy costs uh a minimum of five 5.5 million million i've already found one i pray they don't take it away because they're rare all right now uh yesterday joe i thought brother martin you'll carry me to a room so if you don't know these things you'll be like maybe they are robbing them they are cheating them but you know those very correct prices aj when they meet we'll need another one here two targets we also have that camera which we procrastinate but i i thought that i should i should put that on myself not always because it will be a heavy financial burden and the laptop they are using the other side i think i need to put that on you for now now the things we've gone through i need someone with a calculator with a very sharp mind to do some auditions for us i mean to be a true is okay so you're ready so the lights zero millions mata millionaires i know the speakers these speakers are also already paid but we need to pay back it's yes 3.3 million million ceremonies saturday the carpets capacity one point nine eight millions millionaire military chamber patents and fifty million a thousand is that true how much is yours what do you count somewhere channel so how much is that is it a mecca seven point one eight so a total of point of seven point one eight and we've got two one million emma mutual and i should add you know this place did not have windows hey fortunately denise
