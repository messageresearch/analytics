Jesus for your prence We Appreciate You Lord we pray Lord through your might name Jesus Christ [Music] amen hallelujah yeah we thank the Lord trly for we are here really also want thank our pastor who has given me this opportunity once again stand behind this sacred desk is not always easy to speak but God will give me Grace just yield yourselves to the word and to give you life can we go to Timothy chapter second Timothy chapter 4:7 second Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 can we read uh here in in verse S it says I fought a good fight I've finished my course I've have kept the faith amen this was Paul he was tell he was telling toothy because he was handing he was handing over to Timothy Hallelujah yeah this evening we shall take a small little context it says setting an example Hallelujah as we have read here in the word you can see you can take your seats as you have read here in the word Paul was telling Timothy I fought a good I fought a good fight I finished my course have kept the faith in other words Paul was like an example to Timothy he was telling him you see what I did it's the way to go these examples are still living up to now Paul fought a good fight in his generation but we're also fighting right now in our generation brother Bram said he preached what Paul preached he said what Paul said he's out po right now he's telling the bride I fought a good fight we believe he fought a good fight so it is now to us those people set good examples to us that we have to follow right now though very many things are coming up very many Creeds and dogmas coming out by men who call themselves spiritual men spreading wrong news because of having a a big crowds people may think they they are the right people to guide them in this path but this this is the right way to go what Paul said is what we take what did the apostles say it's what we take Hallelujah there's no any other thing that we are going to take because the Bible says Paul was preaching he said if any Angel comes and changes anything let him be casted an angel is a Messer even our pastors that you see maybe the ones that the the word Angel was just was just sending in for all the the ministers even the the the called ministers the people called and the on the ones that called themselves so the the change some are changing what is here they're not Keeping the Faith right now they're not directing us fight a good fight Hallelujah but from the beginning God came setting examples that we have to follow in every generation he said examples in our generation he said examples but as we read in uh in Hebrews chapter 8 verse3 it says Jesus is the same today yesterday today and forever if he set examples back then the generation of Paul the generation of John wisley the generation of all the angels that he sent the all the prophets he sent is also setting examples right now we are living examples right now because if you set examples in those ages they may not have lived in the same life we are living right now they may not have experienced what we experiencing right now but right now we have the people who are experiencing what we are going through and are setting examples in this world we are setting two examples because this world is led by two Powers everything runs on two things as you even see in the Bible God created a male and female even as we we studied most of us have gone schools we started opposite the opposite the the the things that are about opposites they always two things there's a boy there's a girl there's a woman there's a man there is God there's the devil there is truth there's false all those are setting examples you may be setting a right example or a wrong example it's up to you to what example you're setting right now to the generation you're you're living in right now very many people we see have set good examples to their Generations but we're also setting right now examples we also being Witnesses right now the examples that we are setting are the ones that going are the ones that are going to be the the witnesses we we as examples are going to be the Witnesses on that day if you say that something was so hard for me they will bring for you someone who had overcome who went through this you may say ah po is not in our generation he may have not faced what we fac he may have not seen the internet but they will bring you someone they will bring you a bride who went through what you went through God is so just some people may think that they're facing a lot than other people but we are all going through the same Hallelujah but it's up to you setting an example set an example in your generation be that witness that will say I fought a good fight that your brother and sister can despy about you like tabi when she died most Believers are to cry because she she had set a right example she was a good sister in the church she said an example we also have to set examples if you're not setting a good example you're setting a bad example if you're not spreading a good thing you're spreading a wrong thing that's it you cannot change that then if you feel that you you're in the middle God says those are feel those are are a warm and not warm he will spill them out of his mouth that means that is a noo Zone you cannot be between something so we are setting an example right now Hallelujah can we read also in uh uh in Romans chapter 8 verse 31 it says what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us as you setting an example in this world there's a lot of critics there's a lot of people that will speak there's a lot of people that will laugh at you that may think that are they good they better than you there's a lot of people people who will say you cannot manage but we have a God he said he will not leave us he's always besides us hallelujah who can be against us if God be for us though the storms rage those situations come as tough as nothing he has sa is always with us nothing will be against us if God is with us they may fight against us but they will not overcome Hallelujah yeah we have a lot of things that have written up people's minds that have eaten up Christians Minds people are always leaning on the negative side negative things have always taken up people because you see a very very many people are taking up that root you're also taking up that root that setting examples for you yet you all set an example as a Believer Hallelujah even in church be mindful of the examples you take because in church we have three kinds of believers to be able to know the right example to take be baptized with the Holy Ghost just receive the Holy Ghost you'll know the right example to take you'll know the right people that will motivate you but if you miss out that I don't know Hallelujah yeah we should always lean on God in everything that we do because his grace is always with us you'll not have any other excuse that I failed because of this he has set examples we can see Jacob he was a supplanter he changed him that means what he did for them he can do it the same Hallelujah if he saved him he can save you if he forgave job he can forgive you don't easily give up we have a restaurant yeah we can read also in Matthew chapter 5 verse 15 it say up to 16 it says neither do men light a candle and put it under Bell but on a Candlestick and gives light onto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven Hallelujah they let your light so shine that they may see your good works that they may see the examples you're giving to them that they may see your life your life will will be an example to someone to glorify God hallelujah it's not necessary that you'll come and preach here but your life can be a testimony to someone your life can be an example to someone I was reading uh some act from a book of that was written by RCA sister Rebeca Branham he was she was talking about her mother her mother sistera she was telling her that Mom for you enjoy they were talking for you enjoy washing clothes then the mother looked at her in a you know when someone tells you something you look at them and there's a when when you're not happy with what he said or when you're not when you're not like how can I when you're not like in the same like in the same direction of what he's meaning you someone will easily know so the mother the mother replied to her she said you may think I like washing clo this but uh no Rebecca was so surprised he said I I thought you you like washing clothes even when you go to outside on missions you always washing clothes I thought you enjoy it but she said no the mother also gave some little like she she she was telling she she when she she went she she started pray she was going to pray then she felt so bad that other ministers wives like the ones that were working with uh brother Branham they were supporting in the ministry in the music uh in serving in doing other things in ministering but for her she she was not doing anything she reached out a point saying ah maybe even I'm not worthy brother Branham that's what she started feeling but she said she started praying she was so heartbroken when she started praying a voice spoke to her she it said you can pray what am I coming to to the mothers to to our sisters it is not necessary that you'll do something that everyone will see you because when when when she she heard that voice she said yes I can pray I can do a service for God however much little it is it inspired very many people very many people gave her respect because of her of her being so humble and of her wisdom she of her wisdom when she was washing the clothes once again she washed them and iron them while praying for them setting an example of mothers of sisters you may think you you're doing nothing you may say sister like sister charity right now she plays a guitar for you a sister you cannot you do not have even a good voice you cannot sing you say now what can I do for God you just there pray pray for the brothers pray for the ministers pray for pray for those on that are playing even instruments play for pray for them you may see it as a small thing but you're doing God a service Hallelujah we have to set examples in all ways if you cannot do any other thing come on more the church they will know you because of moping the church there's no there's nothing that we are doing in this world for the service of God that will go unpaid so if you feel that you're not that you cannot do any other anything in church or anything to help the bride of Christ then I don't know I don't know what you will be paid Hallelujah we should set examples Hallelujah set at least one they will know they say ah that brother can pray when I feel I I have something ah I'll go to that brother he will help me we shall pray together Hallelujah set an example we have a race Hallelujah every one that is here you have a rest to rant I don't know you there's no shortcut for that race we are taking the race because God trusted Us in this generation he ordained us this L de generation that is so dirty but he called us out for a reason may we never disappoint God may we always stand with the truth some of us we may be laughed at sometimes you go and preach to someone they laugh at you you tell someone the truth sometime back I was at school and I selling one of my friends he told me never trust God 100% I said ah never some people may think having this uh some people are replacing god with these little things these World things replacing God you may say I have a land I have a car you may think those are the the major blessings of God that he gives but those are just little things Hallelujah let us not be taken by little things sometimes situations come in life and they seem be sometimes they seem bigger in our [Music] lives no sometimes we people need want want God to to to take the same things that we are thinking in our heart our minds that if this is the door it's what God has to take us through but God is good as soon as the children of Israel reached River Jordan it's it had to be part and created way for them he can create way here you may see a wall here but he creates way how did he Phil preach the other man uh when that that unich that was on the on water floating did he fly that was God's way Hallelujah he's setting examples for us he set examples in the past but he again setting examples amid us hallelujah he's setting examples to everyone whatever situation you're going through he's setting an example to someone who has gone through it Hallelujah you may think you're left alone but what may help you go through such things fellowshipping Hallelujah when you fellowship with your brothers they will tell you ah I was also going through something like this but God helped me and I went through it but some people when I they're going through difficult situations they go and they separate themselves from people they go and do other things they say ah God left me so let me do my let me let me find a way that I can go through something but you're going to fail because his word says is the way truth and light if you're trying to make make your own way hey you may find yourself in a tel that you cannot go through Hallelujah because he said he's the way truth and light Hallelujah set examples even to the church members that you're with don't just be a yeah we see even brother Bram he was speaking about Zacharia the father of John here he says and let me read you this quote from uh it is I believest thou this this brother Bram said well now I want you to note something look here a minister of the Gospel a clar man well learned but he failed to believe the angel he said how can these things be I'm old and my wife's is my wife is old well how could these things be why he said I'm Gabriel that sent from God he said and because you are you you you have doubted my word you will be dumb till the day the baby's born for my word for my for my words are going to take effect when God speaks anything it's just got to be so and then when he said so why of course was his meeting now look seems like that the priest he could not look back in the Bible here he had plenty of examples of Sarah Hanah a few of these back there were who after the the pass of the age of bearing received children but just so ruined his work that he could not V he could not vary a bit from from just what he was taught and that's about the condition the church is today isn't it right isn't that right just your regular routine you know and usually God comes around and interprets all the all all the time you know yes sir with his program we have plenty of examples that are being set like we see this priest Zacharia he didn't he didn't believe it he didn't even sometimes we read the Bible we read different examples in the Bible but we leave them aside we leave them aside because people are saying that cannot be possible see Zara even in church people are leaving right examples and are saying ah that cannot be if God Did It for someone he can do it the same even right now if you fill someone with the Holy Spirit he can feel you the same Hallelujah if you give someone what you're yearning for if you give someone a husband he can give you also if you give someone a wife he can give you if you give give some someone a car that is something little to God hallelujah let us don't be let us don't look at examples men give that for me I've worked for years and years I've not even got I've served God that I've not got anything those people are not always right with God that's right that's right are never right go when you serve God righteously ah I don't he can never fail you never will God fail you when he serve right righteously those people always giving wrong examples are the people that live a double life you you you see them at church well dress you see them at church praying singing you say that sister is spiritual but yet when they go outside that brother is spiritual when they go outside H you look at someone and someone will scare you take right examples the God we serve can never fail some people are making God they're making God as if he cannot do anything for us the creator of Heaven and Earth the creat the creator of all the things that you look at of all the good things you may say he did not create CS but he's the one who created the men who are making C that's right Hallelujah that God when you serve him righteously he will give you something that you're yearning for you'll also set an example for someone Hallelujah am Mary had no example but she stood on the word of God Zakaria failed to stand on the word of God sometimes you may you may look at someone in church you say ah because he's in church so if he didn't get it I can also not Get It Mary had no example what happened to Mary Had never happened to anyone but why did she some people are meant to be examples even of the new things that are coming up [Music] Hallelujah because the word promises that there will be a short work for right do you believe it if you believe it then things are going people are going to to discern your life people are going to speak different things people are going to to to bring people back to life yes they're going to pray and bring and bring people back to life then you'll not believe it look at Mary she set a right example she believed whatever God spoke to to her sometimes we look at our lives you say I cannot make it you look at your fathers they didn't make it you have nothing Hallelujah Abraham left his home God sent him he say separate from your family he went without even anything almost but we when we read in the Bible you was among the richest men where do all those things come from just believe unto God sometimes we are taken up by small things we we then to to put them on the same on the same level with God if you fail to get something then you're saying ah no why do you how can you say something that is created even by man you set it as on the same level with God some people are calling blessings of God these minor things in life that you can die and live people are not some people are not even telling people to be filled with the holy spirit that is the best you can get in the world because you have Hidden Treasures Hallelujah you have the Hidden Treasures if you are filled with the Holy Spirit we are going to receive things that our eyes have not seen our ears have not heard Hallelujah that no man has heard of but don't follow wrong examples Hallelujah we see even here in Psalms God is also setting an example for Old Men not only the youth is setting examples for Old Men Let us read that that verse it is in Psalms chapter 71:18 it says now also when I am old and grey-headed oh God forsake me not till I have showed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to everyone that is in is to come even old men are setting examples even the young men are setting examples some people may think when we grow you leave the rest to the young people but you still have to set an example there's a I was in ginger there's a who used to sit in front that used to sing I I I used to look at him most of the times he used to sing and jump you see he's old grhe headed but he used to sing what is that an example that you the youth are going to God will will say I give you all the strength I gave you everything but you didn't use it look at this man he used the strength even the little he had Hallelujah may we set examples may we set examples in every in everything because the word of God is like a menu of Our Lives a menu of the Bride instructions of the Bride Hallelujah just follow all those instructions you'll set a better example to everyone Hallelujah some people are taken up by by by Fame because you see someone is Fame you say that is the right I want to be like that one that person you can wake up in the morning and you he you'll said you listen to news they tell you that someone died of a car accident the one that you want to to be like remember the other rich man when uh rarus was asking for some even something little to eat but when when when all died things changed so choose right examples as you also be right examples to others we are setting examples to the people that are looking at us we are setting examples of the right bride that is coming that is already here some part of the Bride is still in the world if if the bride was already gathered up would not be here so you are setting an example for the one for the last parts that are in the world Hallelujah if you believe you're the bride that's that's what you ought to do there's nothing else setting an example for the bride when you preach to someone let even sometimes you do not need even to preach your life explains everything there some people even you look at he said even in the way there's one person who told us when we were at church he said there's a lady who looked at me she said you're going to church because of of how she looked like he said you are you going to church he said yes I'm going to church can we go together that lady had to pray that day what are we setting examples to the world let your light so shine that men that those that will look at you will glorify God they say those people really have God don't make our God a failure people are making God as if he has no power because you're living wrongly Hallelujah you're the same person we see in church you're the same person we see out there doing some bad stuff so how will you set examples think of that set right examples Hallelujah am said right examples and the Lord will reward you of everything you do you may think is very little you may think ah cleaning church is something little but doing it you're setting examples that God will use will some people but but I didn't have even something to do in church everything was being done by different people at least if someone is moping at least bring water for for that person hallelujah amen may we set examples in this age because God has ordained every person you look at here to be examples to set examples in this generation we are not in the generation of Paul right now we are not in the generation of John wisley we are setting examples to our generation what they went through it's not what we are going through right now Hallelujah so we are setting examples that will be brought we are the people who are going to go God will be using you say some people will say but I lived righteously what and what they say no this was the right thing you may have told someone the truth sometimes most of the times is not that everyone You Preach to has to believe but sometimes you preach to someone to be a witness on that day so that is one of the examples you're setting for everyone there bring an example they say uh come you see they told you you failed to do it examples even as we go in classes examples are say are given to us when before giving an assignment we are always given examples Hallelujah but as we are given examples we also setting at the same time examples God is not always is going to rely on History he going to bring even present things yes we cannot let back the the the the the examples we received back then in the Old Testament in the New Testament we just adding up we just writing a new book of Acts hallelujah what they did it's what we are doing again amen but if you do not follow the right steps you'll miss it out set right examples Hallelujah be a witness someone that you know there are some things we go through in life that someone will look at and say if someone went through something like that it means I can also go through it Hallelujah if God can change someone God can change me that's what you you're supposed to be having in mind but some people think they fail totally because of what because even of the cires that you always having the circles that are being you examples you look at your friend you say ah that one failed you look at this that one failed because of the wrong examples you're taking in your circle right make right circles but if you with your your brother you see ah he's serious with the word though I'm you may not be serious with the word he say ah the other one is serious you look at say is serious that will motivate you sometimes we are in wrong Circle the ones that will call examples because they have something that you're yearning for you say if God gave them that thing maybe maybe they right make right circles the right circles are going to give you right examples in life and when you take the right examples in life definitely your life has to be good your life has to be in the line of God's word hallelujah sometimes we we look at things and say ah if the didn't make it then I can also not make it but examples are being set like we see this priest people are failing to look at examples because of of of not looking Beyond people have a wrong mindset a negative mindset but you not go before the way of God you not go be like you not disrupt God's plans even if you not taking his word or not seeing it as an example to you he fail to see but he would not distract God's go God's plans sometimes we go through difficult situations in life because of the the what we take he would not have been blind he would not not have been dumb if he took it if he just believed the word if he just looked that if God Did It for the other people he can do it the same he would have not been dump hallelujah what examples are you taking taking in life think of that sometimes we take wrong people as examples as people that motivate us sometimes we take wrong things music the so-call some music that is called gospel music you say ah now this one is Gospel this is the example I'm taking some people are taking the the borderline examples brother Bram said if you put on a skirt below the knees then it's okay I'm also taking that he said this and this ah I'm taking that but you're failing to take the right example that's right you know even when Jesus was speaking to to the crowds in the New Testament he spoke Parables but after he explained them to his if you really understand the message you really brother Bram he was right in the middle of the word he used to speak some things that when you take it canally you'll miss out the point what he meant there are very many things people always want to take the milk they do not want they they do not want to take the hard food they like as simple things things that give them uh peace what what they call even peace that even is not even peace if you have no Christ in you that is even not peace right you look at people that you saying ah those people have a peaceful family but you don't know what is taking place in their families some people look at Bobby wi and BBY ah those let me tell you any person that does not have God in life any person they should never lie you that they they good or in life is going on well people come and smile to others in the crowd but when they go to their rooms we find someone so sorrowful you look at rich people you may say ah that made it in life my idea don't be lied right someone who made it in life is someone who is filled with the holy spirit that person will even if you find someone sleeping is smiling because he's peaceful someone filled with the holy spirit that is the right example you take in life he may not have the worldly things that you're looking at he may not have the car you want he may not have the right the good clothes you want he may not have something you want but those people are always peaceful have a peace of mind there's nothing we need in life like a peace of of Mind Hallelujah a peace of mind is better than any other thing you look at people having everything that you're yearning for in life but do not have a peace of mind you you see them on televisions you may think they're okay but they're not okay Hallelujah so take right examples though sometimes God's examples are always criticized and undermined but the examples he took look at brother Branham why did God choose a man who was not educated to preach the message to the the educated to the the people that are not educated to the Presidents to the big people in the world why did God choose such a person do you think there were no people that were educated that would spread the message very well better than brother Bram you're taking right you're taking wrong examples sometimes because of what but the the perspective people have given you about life is always taking the the ones that you despise they're the right examples right now the bride is despised even when you speak people they will laugh at you this life is just in Job 14 verse1 it says we have like a man a man born of a woman is full of trouble and of of short days in like like here in life so let me tell you every those people that you take as examples examine them but you cannot examine them when you do not have the Holy Spirit look if you feel like taking any any example in church look at someone filled with the Holy Spirit look at those people they may not have what you really want but sooner or later they can get every everything that people have worked for for 15 years 20 years someone can get them in just one year how God is able some people are saying some sisters may may are taking wrong examples because when they look at ah I'm I'm approaching 28 I'm approaching 30 and all those that are reach at that age always say ah I'm late for marriage you just go for anyone but have you ever thought of other examples not all that sisters that get married lately are always having a long or are walking in a not like a life that is not good sometimes the set examples that you'll see some people are there to be examples why do you think people like why do you think lame people are born why do you think blind people are born you may say did this person commit anything to God but those people are set like are set to be examples you'll find a lame man preaching there's a man that I always see on the way he he preaches with one leg he's always standing on one leg some of us I don't know what we shall tell God you have everything but you're just there lazy those are the examples you may say he's not a message believer but he's better than you at least he's trying to spread the word of God may God have mercy on us may we set the right examples because God is only is only looking at us right now there's no any other Angel going to come to S There's No Angel going to come set an example there's no one but the bride of Christ Hallelujah may we set right examples let us uh read this quote Hallelujah here brother Bram again was speaking about Mary he said and then she went to tell someone that you know usually when you get something from God you want to tell every everybody else about it here she's she here she going around testifying that she's going to have a baby not knowing any man before there is any life or anything if Mary could do that by something that had never happened before how much more ought you to do it when you sick and take him at his word thousands are healed every year you ought to take him at his at his word why Mary had nothing for an example the only thing she had was the word you've got the word plus millions of of examples every day Hallelujah some of the things you the people going to stand at the Forefront some of the things you're going to stand if God do if you've never seen a person healed of cancer you can say I'm going to be healed and you're he you set an example to the people around you always hear those testimonies for those that read the message you hear someone healed of cancer someone heal raised from dead but brother Bram saying those things that we we as the bride are going to do the same things Hallelujah we have a short but quick work but if that short quick work does not find you prepared you even not know it that it is taking place because of what you're taking right wrong examples you you hearing this and this this and this ah what did K say what did this man ofo say what did this and this but you're living out what even you're supposed to listen to you're taking wrong examples because of the crowds they have Hallelujah Mary had no example but she stood as an example Hallelujah may we change that mindset of saying ah this and this because this one failed or this this who failed Hallelujah may we set right examples may we be Duty bound if you you you at the post of your duty however small it is you'll be an example however small it is you'll be an example on that small thing they will know you for doing something you'll have set an example for someone some people just need a small thing to turn their lives around but even the little things would not do them Hallelujah we are setting examples in this dirty generation there's somewhere I usually eat food from were talking that I told them that for me I'm going to marry I'll not have like this I not believe in girlfriends or what they laughed they said you're going to get a wrong person I have I told them I have examples of people who have good right people for you you're taking wrong examples because the other one failed the other un failed I said for me I believe God can I said if you're right with God he cannot even allow you make a mistake how can I make a mistake you have right example set before you they telling you on no condition you're not supposed to Mar unbel but for you she can change or he can change on what conditions I told them you wait you'll see I'll even call you on my wedding Hallelujah we have to say right examples if they think all man all all all young men are going to be in that D are going to live such a life tell them no I'm not setting that example let me set your an example that is right Hallelujah people no longer Believe In Truth they think some things like truth ended long time ago it is no longer even in the world loyality is no longer in the world because of what examples the ones that are supposed to be examples again looking at other people we have to set right examples if people say it cannot be we have a neor God hallelujah we able to set right examples we are setting right examples in this dirty generation for me my friends that I started with always me wait you'll see we had set right examples Hallelujah set right examples your neighbors they say ah that person he prays a lot people are going to even start respecting you because of the example you're setting to them even old people will seek councel from you and say ah that person is different they will seek knowledge from you because you're setting a right example Hallelujah may God help us set right examples however much situations are difficult to us may we set right examples may we lean on God's word because it is the only thing that can help us really set a good example to the rest Hallelujah because he is our creator he knows everything so if we follow his word I don't think we can set wrong examples if you follow every everything has been every everything you see in the world there's an example for it be it marriage he said an example he said a man is supposed to be of one woman be it love be it be it patience be it anything that we look at right now we have seen right examples people have been patient but for us sometimes we need uh things to be so quick in life at times we take even things that we are not supposed to take that you want to get rich quickly I do this do this and this you'll get rich quickly at the end you start abusing people saying ah God is Not faithful yet you're the one not faithful he said for your examples but you're not taking them Hallelujah may God help us he said new as an example to us he said like it was in the days of Noah it will be the same as this people are leaving out that example people are taking their own perspectives look at people that were saved in newah time very few but people are taking big crowds may you look at right examples the message that we have right now people bled people had to die people had to sacrifice very many things so that can go forth that can reach you but for you just Seated on it you may find here some people who have never even had the message even putting a like playing a message like for 2 hours some people who have never even completed a book one book on 1,000 something the messages brother Bram preached so what examples do you expect to get it is like when you're studying if you don't look at examples the teacher gives you what do you what do you expect to do in the papers you'll do nothing may we take right examples that God has said for us hallelujah may we read these scriptures as we're winding up Hebrews chapter 12: 1-2 was wherefor seeing we also have compassed about with all we sorry let me repeat again wherefore seeing we are also we are also our Compass about which so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every way it and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run with patience the rest that is that is set before us looking onto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endureed the cross despising the shame and sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God may God help us run our race God bless you shall pray Heavenly Father we want to thank you for the Peace of word you have given us Lord loving Master may you help

look at that one look at that one meaning that if this one is bad that one is bad so what you are preaching cannot change the devil likes doing that you see but today we've been given a masterpiece we must be the ones to set the example and even if you wanted to see an example you must see an example of those filled with the Holy Spirit then also we had that we should look at the circles we have the circles of the friends and the people we think we can look at as an example to say I want to be like this one and then if your circle is a bunch of failures you will be you will be feeling like you should also be a failure because the circle around you are all failures but we've been told we can change we can destroy that Circle and have an entirely New Circle praise the name of the Lord
