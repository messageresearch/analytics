[11:42] Pray.
[11:46] Dear heavenly gracious father, in the
[11:49] name of thy son Jesus Christ, Lord and
[11:51] Savior,
[11:53] we lift up our voices unto thee in
[11:56] prayer. Father, our hearts bow before
[11:59] thee.
[12:01] Such a great God and a mighty God,
[12:04] highly exalted.
[12:06] Take the glory, take the honor, Lord
[12:08] Jesus, to thyself because you deserve
[12:12] it. You are worthy, oh Lord, to be
[12:15] praised and to be magnified.
[12:19] Greatly thy faithfulness, oh Lord Jesus,
[12:22] unto each one of us. For all that we
[12:26] have needed, spiritually and physically,
[12:30] thy hand has provided. We are greatly
[12:33] thankful unto thee, oh God Almighty, for
[12:37] your loving kindness, your grace and
[12:40] mercy that has written all our life
[12:43] stories to be called the sons and
[12:46] daughters of God. We have a great
[12:48] privilege that you have granted to us
[12:50] father which we did not deserve but as
[12:54] it pleased thee that you chose us even
[12:57] before the foundation of the world in
[13:00] the beloved the Lord Jesus Christ. Kind
[13:04] heavenly father thou hast bid us to come
[13:07] to thee. Though we come Lord Jesus
[13:11] Christ, you said forsake not the
[13:13] assembling of my soul. Together as we
[13:16] see the day approaching, dear God
[13:19] Almighty, we have come. We ask you Lord
[13:23] to receive us. May we be found worthy
[13:26] and ac be accepted in thy presence. May
[13:30] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:31] cleanse us of all sin and
[13:34] unrighteousness.
[13:36] of both. Lord, we have sinned against
[13:38] thee in words, in deeds, and in
[13:40] thoughts.
[13:42] Therefore, according to that, none of us
[13:44] is worthy, but see us through the blood
[13:48] of Jesus and through eyes of love. By
[13:51] that we are accepted. Heavenly gracious
[13:54] father, we do commit a service into thy
[13:57] hands. We ask you Lord to take the flesh
[14:00] aside each one of us out of the way that
[14:03] you put your words in the lips the mouth
[14:07] of thyself
[14:09] that you may tell him so that he may
[14:12] tell us also we all hear from thee oh
[14:15] God that which was which is and which is
[14:19] to come and commission each one of us
[14:22] instruct us and correct us bringing us
[14:25] all unto perfection
[14:28] Bless the hand that giveth in both
[14:31] tithes and offerings. For as you
[14:33] promised in your word, try me in this
[14:36] and you open the windows of heaven,
[14:39] sending forth showers of blessings upon
[14:42] thy children. Fulfill therefore your
[14:45] word. Kind heavenly father, let your
[14:48] love divine be in the midst of thy
[14:51] people and your glory fill the
[14:54] atmosphere.
[14:55] Lord Jesus Christ. We surrender our
[14:58] hearts to thee this hour that the word
[15:01] may impart upon us the life of the
[15:04] spirit of God. We thank you. May it

[15:25] afflictions of the righteous, but the
[15:27] Lord delivers them out of them all. We
[15:29] therefore ask you, Father, even the

[15:33] fill with the Holy Spirit, those that
[15:35] are thirsty and save those that are

[32:54] him.

[32:57] unbelieves, it's still going to happen.
[33:01] Unbelief does not
[33:05] condemns the unbeliever.
[33:07] The unbelief will send the unbeliever to
[33:11] hell. It will rob him of every blessing.
[33:16] But it does not hinder God from going
[33:18] right on with the believer. See,
[33:22] unbelief does not stop God. It only
[33:25] stops unbelief.
[33:34] Oh, you God by your
[33:40] God.
[33:43] You are God

[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; We are reading in the book of first John
[1:13:51] chapter 3
[1:13:58] and we are reading from verses 11.
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:27] For this,
[1:14:29] for this is the message that ye heard
[1:14:31] from the beginning, that we should love
[1:14:33] one another, not as Cain, who was of
[1:14:36] that wicked one,
[1:14:39] and slew his brother, and whereof slew
[1:14:42] he him because his own works were evil
[1:14:44] and his brothers righteous. Marvel not,
[1:14:47] my brethren, if the world hate you, we
[1:14:51] know that we have passed from death.
[1:14:54] Listen to this script verses vers 14. We
[1:14:58] know that we have passed from death unto
[1:15:01] life. How do we know? How do we know?
[1:15:05] Because we love the brethren. He that
[1:15:08] loveth not his brother abideth in death.
[1:15:13] That is a very strong word, is it not?
[1:15:16] He that loveth not his brother abideth
[1:15:19] in death.
[1:15:20] You see, he says, "We know that we have
[1:15:23] passed from death unto life
[1:15:28] the brethren.
[1:15:30] He that he that loveth not his brother
[1:15:34] abideth in death."
[1:15:36] And then he continues on to say, we read
[1:15:38] up to 17.
[1:15:40] Whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:15:43] murderer,
[1:15:45] and ye know that no murderer has eternal
[1:15:50] life abiding in him.
[1:15:54] Hereby perceive we the love of God,
[1:15:57] because he laid down his life for us,
[1:16:00] and we ought to lay down our lives
[1:16:04] for the brethren.
[1:16:06] But who so has this world is good and
[1:16:10] seeth his brother have need and shutth
[1:16:12] up his bowels of compassion from him how
[1:16:15] dwelleth the love of God

[1:20:19] I believe high school
[1:20:24] and it will be um on 22nd
[1:20:30] to 26th December
[1:20:34] and uh the contribution is 10,000 per
[1:20:36] person.
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:40] Yeah. If you want more details, you can
[1:20:41] come and let us know
[1:20:45] and we'll give you the information.
[1:20:48] Amen. Amen. Um also uh this next Sunday
[1:20:55] I would like to announce that I'll be
[1:20:57] speaking at uh Budo Christian F.
[1:21:02] It's very hard for me to leave the
[1:21:05] Sunday morning here and go to another
[1:21:06] place.
[1:21:11] Usually whenever I went to budo to
[1:21:13] dedicate those students,
[1:21:17] I rush the time
[1:21:19] but it has always been very difficult.
[1:21:23] So and also difficult for them because I
[1:21:25] have to just rush
[1:21:30] but this time I I I have felt led to
[1:21:33] just go and be with them.
[1:21:37] Uh it's an opportunity
[1:21:40] to not all those students are believers
[1:21:42] of the message.
[1:21:45] Um you know but it's an opportunity to
[1:21:47] to minister to hundreds of young people
[1:21:53] and not only dedicate them when they're
[1:21:56] doing exams
[1:21:59] also reach reach out
[1:22:03] so the seed of the word in those young
[1:22:05] hearts.
[1:22:07] I think it is a very noble opportunity.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; So um I on Sunday I will be fully with
[1:22:15] them
[1:22:17] and by God's grace all the candidates we
[1:22:20] have dedicated there
[1:22:25] fully passed.
[1:22:28] So so I believe that the Lord will do it
[1:22:30] again this year.
[1:22:33] remember us as we are with them on
[1:22:34] Sunday on Sunday next week.
[1:22:38] Then on the on I announced here already
[1:22:40] on Wednesday that we are going to have
[1:22:42] visitors on the 15th of October
[1:22:48] uh from from Bible way

[1:22:55] and our very own brother Michael Ray.
[1:22:59] they'll be passing by us
[1:23:02] and um we're going to have a service
[1:23:04] that evening with them.
[1:23:07] So if you have a program,
[1:23:09] please look at your time table
[1:23:12] and if you have a job
[1:23:16] get an off that that day or come or
[1:23:18] leave early.
[1:23:21] We are going to leave. We are going to

[1:23:30] visitors.
[1:23:33] So um there's also many coming in
[1:23:39] from different uh places.
[1:23:42] Some will come from Kamoja.

[1:23:47] sponsoring the work there.
[1:23:51] the uh translation of the of the message

[1:23:56] So a delegation will come from
[1:23:59] and also from TESO

[1:24:44] the name.
[1:24:48] You remember it, brother? Yes.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe I pick someone randomly.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Ask them if they remember the day.
[1:25:02] And also this October is going to be
[1:25:04] quite a busy month.
[1:25:08] Um we are I would like you to pray. We
[1:25:10] are planning to have a brother Isaac and
[1:25:12] from Nairobi
[1:25:17] on one of the weekends. We've not yet
[1:25:19] confirmed which one
[1:25:21] but most most likely the 12th.
[1:25:27] If not then the last one.
[1:25:30] I'll confirm that to you maybe on
[1:25:32] Wednesday or so.
[1:25:34] uh you know the brethren in Nairobi
[1:25:38] are planning to come quite many of them
[1:25:42] I understand almost 70
[1:25:45] are planning to come for our youth camp
[1:25:48] so if you are not planning
[1:25:50] I don't know what you're waiting if you
[1:25:53] are a member here and you are not
[1:25:54] registered
[1:25:56] I don't know what you're waiting
[1:25:59] so please get registered
[1:26:01] and um let us uh be able to uh receive
[1:26:07] those visitors. There are so many coming
[1:26:08] from all over the world.
[1:26:12] The youth camp is always a time of
[1:26:15] gathering for not only young people but
[1:26:17] believers from all over the world.
[1:26:23] They're coming from Australia. They
[1:26:24] coming from Zimbabwe. They coming from
[1:26:26] Kenya. They coming from Ethiopia.
[1:26:28] They're coming from. So please be in
[1:26:31] preparation and
[1:26:35] give your contributions on time
[1:26:38] and uh let us plan for January
[1:26:42] uh and let us see what the Lord will do.
[1:26:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:50] I don't know whether if you're a youth
[1:26:52] or any brother
[1:26:55] and you really not a partaker of the
[1:26:57] church programs and you call yourself a
[1:27:00] believer, it is really a shaming.
[1:27:03] various
[1:27:06] you should be partaker and contribute
[1:27:09] to all the arrangements that have been
[1:27:11] planned because you are the church. I am
[1:27:14] the church. You are the church.
[1:27:17] The church is not the person who is
[1:27:18] coming but the church you are the one
[1:27:21] who is available.
[1:27:24] Is that amen?
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's now quickly get into the
[1:27:28] word. This morning
[1:27:30] we are going to speak about divine love.
[1:27:36] Tell your neighbor divine love.
[1:27:40] Amen. If you love someone close to you,
[1:27:42] tell them I love you.
[1:27:48] I love you.
[1:27:50] I want to ask you a question. How did
[1:27:53] you feel when you were told those words?
[1:27:57] In your heart, how did you feel? Let's
[1:28:01] be honest.
[1:28:02] Can we try it again? Tell your neighbor,
[1:28:05] "I love you."
[1:28:10] There's a sister here. Nobody's telling
[1:28:11] her I love you.
[1:28:17] You see, this is the reason why we're
[1:28:19] going to talk about love
[1:28:22] because the brothers are fearing.
[1:28:26] What if I tell that sister I love you?
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; And then she begins to think
[1:28:33] praise God.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; So love is a wonderful force
[1:28:40] you know when you talk about love
[1:28:43] you know and someone tells you I love
[1:28:45] you
[1:28:47] feel different
[1:28:49] you you cannot feel the same. Is that is
[1:28:52] that true? Yeah, you feel different and
[1:28:55] and and so it's a powerful word,
[1:28:59] but also it's a powerful thing.
[1:29:02] But there are many different kinds of
[1:29:04] love
[1:29:05] and you can love for wrong reasons as
[1:29:08] well
[1:29:10] because you are loving with a different
[1:29:11] kind of love.
[1:29:15] But we today we are not talking about
[1:29:16] any kind of love.
[1:29:19] We are talking about divine love.
[1:29:22] I have a lot of scriptures and quotes,
[1:29:25] but I told you I am committed
[1:29:29] that in every sermon I preach
[1:29:32] that it will mature you
[1:29:34] that you will get somewhere spiritual
[1:29:37] in your Christian walk with God
[1:29:40] in your experience
[1:29:42] and I trust that this will be one of
[1:29:43] those
[1:29:46] divine love.
[1:29:49] There's a lot of things I felt I can
[1:29:51] talk about
[1:29:54] but you pray for me and the Holy Spirit
[1:29:56] will lead and guide me
[1:29:59] to speak only which you need.
[1:30:02] Amen. For this is the message that ye
[1:30:06] heard from the beginning
[1:30:09] that we should love one another.
[1:30:13] And then immediately after he said that,
[1:30:17] okay, before actually he said that
[1:30:19] He he had talked about righteousness
[1:30:23] and um he he was saying that uh he was
[1:30:26] talking about a new birth.
[1:30:30] Please put your mind together with me.
[1:30:34] I'm going to speak for an hour and a
[1:30:35] half.
[1:30:37] And you know whenever I announce the
[1:30:38] time I'm going to speak, I keep it.
[1:30:43] So I don't and the reason why I give you
[1:30:45] the time is because I don't expect you
[1:30:46] to be moving. And maybe you don't know
[1:30:48] how long the preacher is going to speak
[1:30:49] for.
[1:30:54] I remember when I just believed
[1:30:55] something
[1:30:57] of the preachers would preach
[1:31:00] and you don't know how long he will talk
[1:31:02] to you.
[1:31:03] It might be two hours, three or four,
[1:31:07] sometimes five or six.
[1:31:09] You're not too sure. Even when you feel
[1:31:12] pressed, you you you're not too sure.
[1:31:13] Should I wait or should I go?
[1:31:18] My preacher would say, "I'm about to
[1:31:20] finish.
[1:31:22] I'm finishing with this quote. I'm
[1:31:24] finishing in the next five minutes."
[1:31:27] Keep going on and on.
[1:31:30] I don't like that. And I don't like a
[1:31:33] preacher who does that.
[1:31:35] Praise God. I think we ought to be
[1:31:38] honest.
[1:31:40] And also, you know, a man, a person can
[1:31:42] only sit for so long.
[1:31:46] Praise God. And so when I give you the
[1:31:49] time, please, if you are new here,
[1:31:52] just know I'll keep it. So stay focused.
[1:31:56] Tell your neighbor, stay focused. I want
[1:31:59] us to get what I'm talking about. So
[1:32:01] whoever is born of God does not commit
[1:32:04] sin.
[1:32:06] Does not commit sin.
[1:32:09] If you are born of God,
[1:32:11] you cannot commit sin.
[1:32:14] You cannot
[1:32:16] forget about what your mind is telling
[1:32:17] you.
[1:32:19] Listen to what the word is telling you.
[1:32:21] You cannot commit sin. Okay? You can do
[1:32:24] wrong things, but you cannot commit sin.
[1:32:27] Now, we know sin is unbelief
[1:32:30] of the word, but you cannot unbelieve
[1:32:33] the word. If you are born again, you
[1:32:36] will always believe the word.
[1:32:39] Amen. Amen. And also he says because the
[1:32:42] seed remains in you and you cannot sin
[1:32:46] because you are born of God. It is this
[1:32:50] the children of God are manifest
[1:32:53] and the children of the devil.
[1:32:56] Whosoever doeth not righteousness.
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:01] Amen. Mhm.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Now when he talks about this
[1:33:03] righteousness,
[1:33:05] remember he says he cannot sin that is
[1:33:09] born of God.
[1:33:12] Now if it means you if you're born of
[1:33:14] God,
[1:33:16] you will automatically do righteousness.
[1:33:21] So the righteousness is talking about
[1:33:24] is not your works of righteousness.
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:29] It is the righteousness of him in whom
[1:33:33] you are born.
[1:33:37] When you are born again,
[1:33:39] God stops looking at you.
[1:33:43] He starts looking at him in whom you are
[1:33:47] in. Hallelujah.
[1:33:52] you you are dead but you are alive or
[1:33:56] born again
[1:33:58] in Christ.
[1:34:01] So if you are in Christ
[1:34:03] you cannot sin and then he says in this
[1:34:08] we are able to know the children of God
[1:34:11] are the children of the devil. Amen.
[1:34:14] Why? Because when we are in him, we are
[1:34:18] righteous.
[1:34:20] Actually, the Bible even says we are his
[1:34:22] righteousness.
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:25] Amen. And so when we are born again,
[1:34:30] we are righteous,
[1:34:32] righteous
[1:34:34] by declaration
[1:34:37] that righteous.
[1:34:39] Amen. In him.
[1:34:41] So it means a person that is born again
[1:34:46] has to stop looking at himself.
[1:34:49] You need to begin looking at him
[1:34:52] in whom you are in
[1:34:55] because that's what also Christ looks at
[1:34:58] and we are able to know the children of
[1:35:01] God
[1:35:03] by that.
[1:35:05] The children of God will have the
[1:35:08] righteousness of God.
[1:35:11] The children of the devil will try to
[1:35:14] have their own works of righteousness
[1:35:18] and they will not seek the righteousness
[1:35:20] of him
[1:35:23] that comes by the word, but they will
[1:35:26] seek or or they will desire for God to
[1:35:29] accept their righteousness
[1:35:32] [Music]
[1:35:34] which comes by their works.
[1:35:37] And if you go back in the beginning,
[1:35:40] there was Cain and Abel.
[1:35:43] God required a sacrifice.
[1:35:46] But Cain gave a sacrifice
[1:35:48] according to his own way of thinking.
[1:35:53] It was fruits, apples and all those
[1:35:55] things.
[1:35:56] You know, Cain was like, "God, you
[1:35:58] should accept what I have done.
[1:36:01] I have done the best. This is the best I
[1:36:04] can deliver."
[1:36:06] And Cain expected God to accept him or
[1:36:09] receive him the way he is.
[1:36:14] God does not receive any man the way
[1:36:16] they are.
[1:36:19] God does not receive you on the basis of
[1:36:22] your tongue.
[1:36:25] God receives you on the basis of his
[1:36:28] word.
[1:36:31] And you know, you cannot receive or do
[1:36:34] the word of God in your own knowledge
[1:36:36] and wisdom
[1:36:41] because God is higher than us.
[1:36:45] The Bible says his ways are higher than
[1:36:47] our ways.
[1:36:49] His thoughts are higher than our
[1:36:51] thoughts.
[1:36:53] And so he says, "Repent of your sins.
[1:36:56] Repent of your ways.
[1:36:58] Walk in my ways.
[1:37:00] But how can you walk in your in his way?
[1:37:03] And how can a man forsake his way
[1:37:07] is only by one thing which we already
[1:37:09] talked about
[1:37:11] spiritual revelation
[1:37:14] without revelation.
[1:37:16] You will hear the word but you will
[1:37:19] misunderstand it.
[1:37:21] You will misunderstand it for legalism
[1:37:25] instead of revelation.
[1:37:28] Amen. When Cain heard the word, he
[1:37:31] thought all God required was a
[1:37:33] sacrifice.
[1:37:35] He thought God wants me to do something
[1:37:39] and to do it according to my best.
[1:37:43] So that was legalism.
[1:37:46] As long as I dress well,
[1:37:49] as long as I go to church, as long as I
[1:37:52] pay my tithe, I am a believer. That's
[1:37:55] legalism.
[1:37:57] You are doing those things according to
[1:37:59] your own way
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:03] and God will not receive that. But you
[1:38:06] see Abel came when he heard it, he did
[1:38:09] not only hear a sacrifice.
[1:38:12] Oh hallelujah. He had another word
[1:38:16] which was attached to the word
[1:38:18] sacrifice.
[1:38:21] He had a blood sacrifice.
[1:38:25] God never said blood sacrifice.
[1:38:28] So where did Abel receive that word?
[1:38:33] He downloaded it
[1:38:36] from the cloud of God
[1:38:39] by revelation.
[1:38:41] That is why we need spiritual
[1:38:42] revelation.
[1:38:45] When we hear the word, we shall not just
[1:38:48] see what is written.
[1:38:50] We will receive more from God. He will
[1:38:53] understand what he is trying to mean.
[1:38:57] And Cain and and Cain never understood.
[1:39:00] He did the works of the Lord.
[1:39:03] But Abel by spiritual revelation
[1:39:06] he was able to give a blood sacrifice
[1:39:09] and Cain could not understand
[1:39:12] why his sacrifice was rejected
[1:39:16] and why Abel's sacrifice was accepted.
[1:39:19] Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't have spiritual revelation,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; you will never be able to understand
[1:39:27] why somebody else will be blessed by God
[1:39:32] and you will not.
[1:39:35] You will never be able to understand why
[1:39:38] someone believes something
[1:39:41] and for you you feel it is legalism.
[1:39:45] You will not understand because you are
[1:39:48] not in the realm. You are not walking in
[1:39:50] the realm of revelation.
[1:39:53] You are walking in the realm of
[1:39:54] legalism.
[1:39:57] The Bible says, you know, um I'm talking
[1:40:01] of works.
[1:40:03] It says that the the letter kleth
[1:40:06] but the spirit gives life.
[1:40:09] Praise God. Praise God. So when you talk
[1:40:12] about women dressing
[1:40:16] Many people who are not having
[1:40:17] revelation
[1:40:20] will think we have laws
[1:40:22] that permit women not to wear trousers.
[1:40:27] We do not have such laws.
[1:40:30] To them who don't have revelation,
[1:40:33] it is a law, legalism, a work that a
[1:40:37] person must do.
[1:40:39] But when you have revelation,
[1:40:42] you go beyond the law.
[1:40:45] You go to the level of revelation.
[1:40:48] You go to the level of intent.
[1:40:51] What God intended for you to do.
[1:40:56] You will look it as a at it as a law.
[1:41:00] You have to give 10%.
[1:41:04] That's why you would even count and make
[1:41:06] sure even the coins you count them.
[1:41:10] Not less, not more.
[1:41:12] But if you have revelation
[1:41:15] and you're not walking by law, you will
[1:41:18] understand that all my blessings come
[1:41:20] from God
[1:41:22] for me to give 10%.
[1:41:25] Is even too small. I will give much more
[1:41:28] than that because I have a revelation
[1:41:32] that he that gave me this is more than
[1:41:35] able to give me much more.
[1:41:38] That's how believers that walk by
[1:41:39] revelation.
[1:41:41] And you don't do it out of pain. You do
[1:41:44] it out of joy.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why in the Old Testament,
[1:41:48] you know, it was by pain, sorrow. But in
[1:41:51] the New Testament, by grace through
[1:41:54] revelation, it is by joy.
[1:41:57] Amen. Oh my. There's much I can talk
[1:42:00] about.
[1:42:02] And so after he has now explained the
[1:42:04] righteousness of God,
[1:42:08] Then he says, "Whosoever does not do
[1:42:10] righteousness is not of God.
[1:42:13] [Music]
[1:42:16] Neither he that loveth not."
[1:42:21] Praise God. Now I can say right. The
[1:42:25] righteousness of God is equals to love.
[1:42:31] Today you're going to see love in a
[1:42:32] different way.
[1:42:35] Open your heart. Just help me and open
[1:42:38] your heart. For this is the message that
[1:42:40] he had from the beginning
[1:42:43] that we would love we should love one
[1:42:45] another.
[1:42:48] Amen. And then immediately after he he
[1:42:50] begins to pronounce love,
[1:42:53] he begins to talk about Cain.
[1:42:58] Cain who was of the wicked one
[1:43:02] he killed his brother and then he asks a
[1:43:05] question why did he kill his brother
[1:43:08] because Kane's works were evil
[1:43:12] but his brothers were righteous.
[1:43:16] Amen. And he says don't be shocked
[1:43:19] if the world hate you.
[1:43:22] Amen. Meaning when you receive the love
[1:43:25] of God
[1:43:27] and you love the word of God, you will
[1:43:30] love everybody.
[1:43:32] But the world, the seed,
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; I almost titled this the proof of seed.
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:42] Amen. Because the line, the seed
[1:43:47] will never be able to love.
[1:43:51] Listen
[1:43:52] church, there are people in this world
[1:43:56] that do not have ability to love.
[1:44:01] They will behave as if they're loving,
[1:44:04] but they cannot truly genuinely love.
[1:44:10] And that example is Cain.
[1:44:13] He never had love in his heart.
[1:44:18] He loved Cain in life. He loved Cain in
[1:44:23] death. And yet Cain was serpent.
[1:44:29] And someone told me, "Pastor, the Bible
[1:44:30] says, love your brother.
[1:44:34] So I should love a fellow believer.
[1:44:37] I should love a person who we agree
[1:44:39] with." No.
[1:44:42] When the Bible is speaking about Cain Ab
[1:44:44] loving his brother,
[1:44:47] and Kane hating his brother. Listen,
[1:44:50] these were two different seedlines.
[1:44:54] Kane was not a believer. He was a
[1:44:57] makebeliever
[1:44:58] but not a genuine believer. Cain was the
[1:45:02] seed of the serpent.
[1:45:05] But Abel had love for Cain.
[1:45:10] What kind of love is that? and can only
[1:45:13] be divine love.
[1:45:18] The love of God, the love which can
[1:45:21] never be defeated.
[1:45:23] The love which goes to heaven.
[1:45:26] The love which comes on earth. The love
[1:45:28] which goes to hell.
[1:45:31] The love which is permanent in every
[1:45:33] situation.
[1:45:35] Love which is not changed by situation.
[1:45:39] Love which is not moved.
[1:45:42] Love which is strong,
[1:45:45] love which is permanent,
[1:45:47] that is divine. God is love.
[1:45:52] That's what Abel had. But Kane never had
[1:45:58] he could not have it
[1:46:00] because he was not born of God.
[1:46:03] He was born of a son but not born of
[1:46:06] God. And if you are here this morning
[1:46:09] and you are born of God, you must have
[1:46:11] this Lord.
[1:46:13] But if you do not have, there is a
[1:46:16] problem with your experience.
[1:46:20] Amen. If you have someone in the world
[1:46:22] today
[1:46:24] that you dislike
[1:46:26] or rather you may dislike them, that's
[1:46:28] okay. But you hate them.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; You hurt them.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I'm coming to your address.
[1:46:35] If you have someone you hat
[1:46:38] in your heart and you have even said
[1:46:42] that one even when they should never
[1:46:44] come on my barrier
[1:46:48] I cannot sit in the same room with them
[1:46:51] I cannot tell them I love you then
[1:46:54] brother sister you are not a Christian
[1:46:57] yet
[1:47:02] you realize why this is a narrow
[1:47:05] It is not easy
[1:47:07] to love your enemy.
[1:47:10] So when I talk about love, look at it in
[1:47:13] the context of enemy,
[1:47:18] not loving your friend.
[1:47:20] Love your enemy.
[1:47:23] Praise God.
[1:47:25] This one is going to design you.
[1:47:28] Oh, praise God. As I was studying, I was
[1:47:30] being designed.
[1:47:33] By the time we are done with the service
[1:47:34] today,
[1:47:36] you will be discerned.
[1:47:38] You will know where you're falling.
[1:47:40] So please sit, relax and let us enjoy
[1:47:44] this flight.
[1:47:46] Praise God.
[1:47:48] Amen. It might not be a whole excitement
[1:47:50] thing, but we are going to feed on the
[1:47:53] world.
[1:47:56] Not as Cain who was of that wicked one
[1:48:00] and he killed his brother.
[1:48:02] Why did he kill him? Because his own
[1:48:04] works were evil and his brothers
[1:48:07] righteous.
[1:48:09] Marvel not my brethren.
[1:48:11] If the world hates you, so the world
[1:48:14] will hate you. I speak to you right now,
[1:48:18] the world will hate you. As long as you
[1:48:20] have the love of God, the world will
[1:48:23] hate you. When Jesus came in the world,
[1:48:26] he was hated by the world. The Bible
[1:48:29] says they love the darkness.
[1:48:32] And they hated the light. But you see
[1:48:35] the light always loved the darkness.
[1:48:38] He loved us and he came in the darkness
[1:48:41] of the world. The Bible says God dwells
[1:48:44] in the thickest of darkness.
[1:48:49] Amen. But light will always dwell in
[1:48:52] darkness.
[1:48:54] But darkness can never dwell in the
[1:48:56] light.
[1:48:58] You can never have hatred.
[1:49:00] But he will always have love.
[1:49:03] Even to those that hate you.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God. We know. How do
[1:49:12] you know? The Bible says we are passed
[1:49:16] from death to life. We are born again.
[1:49:19] We are a new creation in Christ Jesus.
[1:49:23] But how do you know? How do you know
[1:49:27] that you have passed from death
[1:49:30] to life? Let us stop singing scriptures
[1:49:34] when we don't mean them. When we don't
[1:49:37] have them, the Bible says we know that
[1:49:41] we are passed from death to life
[1:49:45] because we love the brethren.
[1:49:49] And the brethren here
[1:49:51] is not only those who believe like you.
[1:49:56] We have seen the context.
[1:49:59] Amen. When you love your brethren.
[1:50:03] Amen. Then you know you have passed from
[1:50:05] death.
[1:50:08] He that loveth not his brother
[1:50:11] abideth in death.
[1:50:14] If there is someone you don't love,
[1:50:17] someone you blacklisted,
[1:50:19] someone you hate with a passion, I know
[1:50:22] why you do that. Because they did
[1:50:25] something to you. But I want to tell you
[1:50:27] this morning, you are abiding in death
[1:50:29] yourself. You must forgive them and you
[1:50:33] must love them because the love of God
[1:50:35] is unconditional.
[1:50:39] Hallelujah. Whosoever hateth his brother
[1:50:42] is a murderer.
[1:50:46] And you know that no mother has eternal
[1:50:49] life abiding in him.
[1:50:54] So if you don't love your brother, you
[1:50:56] mother.
[1:50:58] And we here how do we perceive the love
[1:51:01] of God?
[1:51:03] Because he laid down his life for us.
[1:51:06] And we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:51:09] the brethren.
[1:51:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, in a message, it is I be not
[1:51:18] afraid.
[1:51:20] So, he's got other men on the field, the
[1:51:22] great men, and I'm one of the and and
[1:51:24] I'm one of the small. And this is
[1:51:26] brother Brham's declaration.
[1:51:34] Yet, he was one of the greatest.
[1:51:36] But the way he spoke
[1:51:39] but my little part
[1:51:41] I like to do for him
[1:51:45] to show him my expression
[1:51:49] about my love for him.
[1:51:53] I love him with all of my heart.
[1:51:57] How many can say I love Jesus with all
[1:51:59] of my heart
[1:52:03] but I don't love my brother?
[1:52:06] I love him but not with all my heart.
[1:52:11] Okay.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; But you said you love Jesus with all
[1:52:13] your heart. Listen. And I cannot love
[1:52:16] him
[1:52:17] without loving you all.
[1:52:20] You you cannot love God.
[1:52:23] My brothers and sisters, stop
[1:52:25] pretending.
[1:52:27] You cannot love God
[1:52:30] with all your heart and you don't love
[1:52:32] your brother with all your heart.
[1:52:36] For he would rather I would love you all
[1:52:38] and love him.
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:42] I would rather you would love my
[1:52:44] children instead of loving me.
[1:52:47] And me being a parent I think that
[1:52:49] that's what about him the same thing.
[1:52:53] If you say you love me
[1:52:56] But then you go behind me and do
[1:52:58] something to one of my children.
[1:53:01] I know you don't love me. So if you say
[1:53:03] you love God,
[1:53:05] what about his children?
[1:53:08] Amen. Let's come back in the camp now.
[1:53:10] Amen. What about his children? Some of
[1:53:12] you have brothers you can never hug.
[1:53:15] Sisters you can never hug. Amen. People
[1:53:18] you can never talk to. Amen. You go to
[1:53:21] the same church, but you're filled with
[1:53:23] hatred. You're filled with anger. You're
[1:53:26] filled with anguish. You believe the
[1:53:28] same message. But you cannot even look
[1:53:31] at each other and say, "I love you." You
[1:53:34] lie and the love of God is not in you.
[1:53:38] There's no way you can love God. If you
[1:53:41] don't love every brother,
[1:53:43] every sister, you have to have love for
[1:53:47] them.
[1:53:51] Praise God. Don't you worry. We're just
[1:53:53] taking off here.
[1:53:56] What is love? Let us all of us go to
[1:53:59] first Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:54:03] Oh God,
[1:54:05] may you help us this morning.
[1:54:08] 1 Corinthians 13. We are going to begin
[1:54:10] from vers one.
[1:54:12] Quickly now.
[1:54:14] Though I speak with tongues of men and
[1:54:16] of angels
[1:54:18] and uh I have no charity, I am become a
[1:54:21] sounding brass or a tinkerling symbol.
[1:54:31] All right, just listen now. And though I
[1:54:33] have gift of prophecy and understand all
[1:54:35] mysteries and knowledge, and though I
[1:54:37] have all faith so that I could remove
[1:54:39] mountains and have not charity, I am
[1:54:41] nothing. And though I bestow all my
[1:54:42] goods to feed the poor. And though I
[1:54:44] give my body to be banned, and have not
[1:54:46] charity, it profitth me nothing. Charity
[1:54:48] serveth long and is kind. Charity envth
[1:54:51] not. Charity forth not itself. Is not
[1:54:53] puffed up. We will get to all that. Does
[1:54:55] not behave itself and seemly seeketh not
[1:54:56] our own. Is not easily provoked.
[1:54:59] Thinkketh no evil. Rejoices not in
[1:55:01] iniquity, but rejoices in the truth.
[1:55:03] Beareth all things, believeth all
[1:55:04] things, hope all things, endureth all
[1:55:06] things. Now what love is not
[1:55:11] Let us begin with that according to what
[1:55:13] Apostle Paul laid down here in
[1:55:14] Corinthians.
[1:55:16] He says love, let us go slowly and get
[1:55:20] love is not tongues of men and of
[1:55:23] angels.
[1:55:28] Okay. Love is not prophecy.
[1:55:31] Oh, you can prophesy. That means you
[1:55:34] have the love of God. Oh, because you
[1:55:36] can speak in tongues and prophesy of men
[1:55:38] and of angels. That means you have
[1:55:40] loving heart.
[1:55:42] Love is not understanding mysteries.
[1:55:45] Oh, I understand all the mysteries of
[1:55:46] the seventh and all this and that.
[1:55:49] No, love is not knowledge.
[1:55:52] Love is not faith. Love is not even
[1:55:54] helping the poor.
[1:56:00] So you can help the poor
[1:56:03] but not have life.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; So that's not charity.
[1:56:08] M love is not self-sacrifice
[1:56:13] and sincerity.
[1:56:15] You can sacrifice yourself.
[1:56:18] Give yourself for others. You are so
[1:56:21] sincere. Don't sincere.
[1:56:24] But when you do not have love,
[1:56:28] praise God. We've seen men who have done
[1:56:31] that and they can give themselves for
[1:56:34] others.
[1:56:35] They have lived selfless.
[1:56:38] Some of them we we even talk about them
[1:56:40] in history.
[1:56:42] Others they were even canonized by Rome
[1:56:44] to become saints.
[1:56:48] But that's not what true love is.
[1:56:51] Amen. I'm talking about divine love. You
[1:56:54] can do all that but yet not have love.
[1:56:58] So let us look at the characteristics of
[1:57:00] love.
[1:57:04] Love. And while I'm talking, you check
[1:57:06] yourself.
[1:57:09] Love is longsuffering.
[1:57:12] Love is kind.
[1:57:15] Love has no envy.
[1:57:18] Love has no busting.
[1:57:21] And now it's not one of these.
[1:57:24] It's not one of these.
[1:57:27] It's not one of these.
[1:57:30] I'm I'm saying a long list of things,
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; okay? But it's not one of them.
[1:57:36] It's all of them together.
[1:57:41] Yes. So you say, "Oh, I have
[1:57:42] longsuffering. Jesus have love."
[1:57:47] As as I'm going down, you will see that
[1:57:50] love is another commandment.
[1:57:54] The Old Testament gives gives 11 ten
[1:57:57] commandments.
[1:57:59] Jesus then comes and says another
[1:58:01] commandment again.
[1:58:04] because this one fulfills all of all the
[1:58:06] requirements of the law.
[1:58:08] Praise God. So when you and and and the
[1:58:11] law the principle of the law is if you
[1:58:14] break one you have broken all.
[1:58:18] So so you have to keep all but in this
[1:58:21] case you are not keeping these things by
[1:58:23] yourself.
[1:58:24] It is what you have when you have love.
[1:58:30] Praise God. So it love has
[1:58:33] longsuffering.
[1:58:36] It has no envy,
[1:58:39] no boasting,
[1:58:41] vaunting.
[1:58:42] I'm the one who did that. I'm the one
[1:58:45] who did that. No, love has no boasting.
[1:58:48] Love is not puffed up,
[1:58:52] selfinflated
[1:58:54] pride.
[1:58:56] You know, brother, just just just
[1:58:57] interpret what I'm saying here. Love,
[1:58:59] you know, is not self-inflated pride.
[1:59:05] You know, being puffed up
[1:59:08] is when you have you you you lift up
[1:59:10] yourself
[1:59:12] in your own pride.
[1:59:15] Love doesn't have or behave unsemly or
[1:59:18] improper behavior.
[1:59:23] Love is not selfseeking.
[1:59:26] Love is not easily provoked.
[1:59:31] You know, we have a word called
[1:59:34] people who can
[1:59:36] someone can come and really try to make
[1:59:38] you flare up
[1:59:42] and say enough is enough.
[1:59:47] I will show you. You don't have love.
[1:59:51] You don't have love.
[1:59:58] You don't have love.
[2:00:01] Praise God.
[2:00:03] Hallelujah.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Some of you who are dozing, I'm going to
[2:00:05] ask you to come and sit on the front
[2:00:06] seat.
[2:00:09] It will be polite so it will not.
[2:00:12] Don't worry. So don't don't doze. Praise
[2:00:16] God. I want you to have love.
[2:00:19] Just just follow me. Love thinkketh no
[2:00:22] evil,
[2:00:24] is not easily provoked,
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:27] doesn't rejoice in sin,
[2:00:32] iniquity.
[2:00:34] When when something wrong is happening,
[2:00:38] you cannot rejoice in your heart.
[2:00:41] You will not have peace. That's how you
[2:00:43] know you have love.
[2:00:46] Love rejoices in the truth.
[2:00:50] It beareth all things.
[2:00:53] Covering over. Now bearing all things
[2:00:54] means covering over the imperfections
[2:00:58] and shortcomings of others.
[2:01:02] Acting as a shield
[2:01:05] against harm and wrongdoing rather than
[2:01:07] exposing fault.
[2:01:11] Praise God. Have you seen married
[2:01:14] couples
[2:01:15] who claim they love each other and then
[2:01:19] they begin fighting?
[2:01:21] Many years ago, we used to have a
[2:01:22] neighbor like that. Neighbors.
[2:01:25] So when they begin fighting, that's when
[2:01:28] you will know everything that happens in
[2:01:30] their house.
[2:01:32] They will speak everything there.
[2:01:40] better than you. You are you are witches
[2:01:42] in you do this in your family
[2:01:45] even yesterday you did this now even you
[2:01:49] and and later on okay continue
[2:01:52] it's not love that's why oh my my my may
[2:01:56] God help us that's why the prophet said
[2:02:01] under no circumstance
[2:02:03] can I believe
[2:02:07] now here are certain circumstances
[2:02:10] that you can get married wi with some
[2:02:12] certain group of people.
[2:02:16] We know brother advises us not to mix
[2:02:18] marriages
[2:02:22] you know white black
[2:02:25] mar in your race
[2:02:28] but he never said under no circumstance.
[2:02:35] So he said under no circumstance should
[2:02:38] a believer man believe.
[2:02:43] That's that why because if you do not
[2:02:46] have love
[2:02:48] your marriage cannot stand
[2:02:51] and the love I'm talking about is not
[2:02:54] the human love is not the feeling you're
[2:02:59] feeling like something is like
[2:03:00] electricity
[2:03:02] even when you talk about how you love
[2:03:04] someone
[2:03:06] can even cry because they have an
[2:03:09] powering of love for them. Those are
[2:03:12] feelings.
[2:03:15] Sometimes you can even feel your heart
[2:03:18] is almost coming out.
[2:03:21] If they say I no longer love you, you
[2:03:23] can even feel like you are sick. Even
[2:03:26] you feel pain on your heart. Oh my god.
[2:03:30] The way I love them. The way No brother,
[2:03:33] sister. Come on. Those are feelings.
[2:03:38] Soon you will have to grow that
[2:03:41] after some time even if they chucked you
[2:03:45] can get healed because that was a
[2:03:48] feeling you had and it left. But the
[2:03:51] kind of love I'm talking about is higher
[2:03:54] than a feeling
[2:03:56] is higher than human feeling.
[2:03:59] It is something divine
[2:04:02] make you cover someone's wrong
[2:04:07] that will make you amen their
[2:04:10] imperfection
[2:04:14] their shortcomings.
[2:04:16] You will shield them from harm.
[2:04:18] Even when it means for you to be the one
[2:04:20] to be blamed.
[2:04:23] You will shield them from harm.
[2:04:26] You will never expose their fault.
[2:04:29] Brother that is love.
[2:04:33] Amen. Love beareth all things.
[2:04:37] This one means to be trusting.
[2:04:40] Assume the best about others
[2:04:43] [Music]
[2:04:45] and give them the benefit of the doubt
[2:04:51] rather than being gullible or naive. It
[2:04:53] doesn't mean that if you bear all things
[2:04:55] or rather you believe all things doesn't
[2:04:57] mean you are gullible or naive
[2:05:13] but rather it means when a brother tells
[2:05:16] you something.
[2:05:19] Praise God. I'm seeing a lot of
[2:05:21] movements. I pray that we stay together.
[2:05:25] Listen, when a brother, if you have love
[2:05:27] in your heart
[2:05:29] and a brother does something
[2:05:32] and you don't like it
[2:05:34] and he tells you why he did it and he
[2:05:37] says, "I'm sorry. I hurt you, but I
[2:05:39] never met you.
[2:05:41] No, I don't believe you.
[2:05:44] There is something there." No, there's
[2:05:47] not something there. There is something
[2:05:48] in you.
[2:05:52] The Bible says to the pure all things
[2:05:56] are pure.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; If you're pure in your heart,
[2:06:00] your brother will tell you, "I'm sorry.
[2:06:03] I never meant to do it. They may be
[2:06:05] lying or saying the truth." But if you
[2:06:08] have the love of God in your heart,
[2:06:11] you will take them at their word,
[2:06:14] you receive, you believe what they are
[2:06:15] saying. And also when the word is
[2:06:18] spoken,
[2:06:20] you will believe all the word. All the
[2:06:22] word.
[2:06:25] Love hope all things
[2:06:28] is to expect the best in people
[2:06:32] and situations. To never give up on
[2:06:35] somebody
[2:06:36] and to trust in God's ultimate plan.
[2:06:44] Have hope. You know you you you trust in
[2:06:47] God yes but expect the best in God.
[2:06:52] The reason why we we are Christians
[2:06:55] but we are divided more than the
[2:06:57] unbeliever
[2:07:00] because the attitude is much better.
[2:07:05] But the attitude of believers many times
[2:07:07] is bad.
[2:07:11] We always expect the worst in people.
[2:07:16] We always expect the worst in people.
[2:07:21] When someone does something,
[2:07:23] before you even know, the moment you
[2:07:26] receive an accusation,
[2:07:29] then
[2:07:31] then you believe it.
[2:07:33] You you believe it without even finding
[2:07:35] trying to find out. You just try to put
[2:07:38] the brother or the sister deeper in the
[2:07:40] deep.
[2:07:42] How about expecting the best in your
[2:07:44] brother?
[2:07:47] Expecting the best in your sister. How
[2:07:49] about changing your attitude?
[2:07:52] How about hoping all things are good?
[2:07:58] Love endureth all things.
[2:08:01] A steadfast unwavering form of love
[2:08:06] that does not quit
[2:08:09] but remains firm
[2:08:12] and patient
[2:08:14] through hardship
[2:08:16] through opposition.
[2:08:19] You endure.
[2:08:21] You endure. Some of you are married. If
[2:08:24] you you have this love I'm talking
[2:08:26] about,
[2:08:28] you will one one two three things. I'm
[2:08:30] going back to my father's house.
[2:08:34] Where is endurance?
[2:08:38] Through opposition
[2:08:40] through issues you have with your
[2:08:42] husband.
[2:08:44] Sister, endure.
[2:08:46] Some of you brothers, do you know men
[2:08:49] are becoming sisters these days?
[2:08:52] They are the ones running away from
[2:08:53] their homes.
[2:08:56] This sermon today is is realistic.
[2:09:00] They are the ones leaving the home.
[2:09:03] They take off.
[2:09:05] Why? Because they disagreeing with their
[2:09:07] wives.
[2:09:09] Maybe because of, you know,
[2:09:13] you find men who don't want to sleep at
[2:09:15] home.
[2:09:17] They don't even want even when they
[2:09:19] sleep at home, they don't want to go in
[2:09:20] the bedroom.
[2:09:23] They don't have any endurance in them.
[2:09:26] But true love
[2:09:29] endures all
[2:09:32] things rather have endurance.
[2:09:36] Sometimes we need to endure a little
[2:09:38] more.
[2:09:41] Some brothers we need to endure them.
[2:09:45] Some sisters we need to endure them.
[2:09:48] Endurance means
[2:09:50] some brothers are hard.
[2:09:52] Some sisters are hard. Some are
[2:09:55] difficult to deal with. But brother, if
[2:09:58] you have the love of God in your heart,
[2:10:01] you will not give up on them.
[2:10:03] Oh my, I feel like shouting twice my
[2:10:05] size. Let me tell you, you who is seated
[2:10:08] here
[2:10:11] that one I'm done with you. You don't
[2:10:13] have endurance
[2:10:15] which means you don't have this love.
[2:10:18] Oh my. May God help you. You need to
[2:10:21] repent of your ways.
[2:10:23] Have some endurance.
[2:10:27] Don't end up people.
[2:10:32] I am done with I just see them.
[2:10:36] I'm just looking at the dealings.
[2:10:40] It is a brethren
[2:10:42] go to the same church
[2:10:45] rather you are the one with
[2:10:49] to be born again.
[2:10:51] Amen. You find them in the music
[2:10:54] department
[2:10:57] and they are done with each other. You
[2:10:59] find them in a church.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; You find them in church. They are done
[2:11:02] with each other. So I'm done with that
[2:11:04] one. I'm done with that one. Praise God.
[2:11:08] Praise God.
[2:11:10] Sometimes when I'm preaching, I can
[2:11:12] almost point you out
[2:11:15] because the Holy Spirit reveals to me.
[2:11:17] But but then as a pastor, I said, "No,
[2:11:20] it may cause something." But you know
[2:11:23] each other.
[2:11:25] If you are done with each other,
[2:11:32] the things he has done to me, even God
[2:11:36] in heaven knows it. Even the devil,
[2:11:40] even
[2:11:41] me, I just look at him.
[2:11:44] You are the one with something wrong.
[2:11:48] You need to be born again.
[2:11:51] If God gives you the Holy Spirit
[2:11:56] to come and bring give you love,
[2:12:00] then abundant love
[2:12:06] that will cause you to love somebody you
[2:12:08] think you're done with. Praise God.
[2:12:12] Let us not be done with one another.
[2:12:18] We are only done with Satan.
[2:12:22] I want you to confess on your mouth. I
[2:12:24] am done with Satan.
[2:12:27] I am done with Satan. But I love my
[2:12:30] brother. I love my sister. Amen. No
[2:12:33] matter what they have done to me.
[2:12:36] Amen.
[2:12:38] Then we know you have God in your heart.
[2:12:44] Amen.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:12:49] I hope that arrived at home.
[2:12:51] [Music]
[2:12:53] Now, what the kind of love I'm talking
[2:12:56] about,
[2:12:58] the Bible says in vers 8
[2:13:01] of 1 Corinthians 13,
[2:13:04] charity never faileth.
[2:13:10] This kind of love, brother, it cannot
[2:13:13] fail.
[2:13:15] Amen. It cannot fail.
[2:13:18] It cannot fail.
[2:13:20] Everything else will fail. Prophecies
[2:13:23] will fail. You know, tongues will fail.
[2:13:27] They will seize. Knowledge will will
[2:13:29] vanish away. But this kind of love. It
[2:13:33] is permanent.
[2:13:35] It is like a rock. It cannot fail. When
[2:13:39] everything fails, this love cannot fail.
[2:13:44] Amen. If you have failed in your
[2:13:48] relationship,
[2:13:50] amen, that means you don't have this
[2:13:51] kind of love.
[2:13:53] But brother, if a sister has this kind
[2:13:55] of love and a brother has this kind of
[2:13:57] love, then you cannot fail.
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:03] Hallelujah. And I want to declare to
[2:14:05] you, Amen. Some of us have this kind of
[2:14:08] love.
[2:14:10] Amen. I see my wife saying, "Amen."
[2:14:14] Therefore, our marriage cannot fail.
[2:14:20] Hallelujah. And I can never hate any of
[2:14:22] you.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what you do,
[2:14:28] if I if I had time, I would let to you
[2:14:30] some of the things I've been done to.
[2:14:34] But, brethren, I don't pretend.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; I used to hate. I used to hate.
[2:14:40] That is the truth. until one day God
[2:14:43] baptized me with his blood.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; From that day, he even gave me a song.
[2:14:51] When I when I needed to forgive those
[2:14:53] who hurt me,
[2:14:55] I couldn't do it. Even to those who
[2:14:58] haunt me,
[2:15:00] some people can really haunt you.
[2:15:04] But when his grace found me so wretched,
[2:15:09] poor and blind, I couldn't help it. But
[2:15:14] to say I forgive
[2:15:17] and that's what will happen to every
[2:15:18] brother
[2:15:20] because this kind of love can never be
[2:15:26] first John. We are beginning to cruise
[2:15:29] now. 1 John 4 16. And we have known and
[2:15:34] believed the love of God
[2:15:39] that he has to us.
[2:15:41] God is love.
[2:15:48] Now we have known why we cannot fail
[2:15:51] because God
[2:15:55] is love.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; So God is equals to love.
[2:16:02] So this kind of love I'm talking about
[2:16:04] is actually God
[2:16:07] and he that dwelleth in God
[2:16:12] and God in him
[2:16:16] rather dwelleth in love or he that in
[2:16:20] love
[2:16:22] this love you have to dwell in it
[2:16:24] meaning
[2:16:29] you don't have it. You're dwelling it.
[2:16:33] Amen. Then you are dwelling in God
[2:16:38] and God in you.
[2:16:40] First John 4:8, he that loveth not
[2:16:44] knoweth no not God.
[2:16:48] For God is love.
[2:16:51] For with and and Luke 137 says, "For
[2:16:54] with with God nothing shall be
[2:16:57] impossible.
[2:17:01] [Music]
[2:17:02] Pastor, you don't know what they did to
[2:17:04] me.
[2:17:06] They hurt me beyond repair.
[2:17:09] Oh, which means you are not repaired
[2:17:11] yet.
[2:17:13] Let me tell you brother sister. Amen.
[2:17:15] Receive this love. When you receive this
[2:17:18] love, amen, with God,
[2:17:22] nothing shall be impossible.
[2:17:24] You will be repaired with God.
[2:17:27] He will forgive them.
[2:17:30] Everything shall be possible.
[2:17:32] There is no impossibilities with God.
[2:17:36] God is love. Listen, faith is a
[2:17:39] substance.
[2:17:41] Son can copy any kind of gift,
[2:17:45] any kind of a manifestation,
[2:17:52] any kind of manifestation,
[2:17:55] any kind of gift, brother, Satan can
[2:17:59] manifest it.
[2:18:03] So if you want to see God,
[2:18:06] don't look for gifts and manifest it.
[2:18:11] Someone speaks in tongues. Someone
[2:18:13] prophesies. Someone,
[2:18:16] you know, designs somebody.
[2:18:20] This man has God.
[2:18:23] Sometimes they don't have God at all.
[2:18:28] Because Satan can manifest all those
[2:18:30] things
[2:18:32] just as God can.
[2:18:35] So we don't want to dwell on those
[2:18:36] things.
[2:18:38] Some people can manifest great gifts
[2:18:42] when they are filled with a lot of
[2:18:44] hatred.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; They are not born again.
[2:18:51] But you see, Satan can manifest all
[2:18:53] those things.
[2:18:55] But he cannot lie.
[2:19:00] He cannot love
[2:19:03] because God is love.
[2:19:06] Satan cannot lie.
[2:19:10] Can you allow me to say this this
[2:19:11] morning? That even his children cannot
[2:19:14] lie.
[2:19:17] But God is love and his children will
[2:19:21] always love.
[2:19:24] Hallelujah. Amen. You see a man humble
[2:19:29] and loving and good to his neighbors and
[2:19:33] a good citizen, a good fellow, a good
[2:19:37] man and a Christianity
[2:19:42] full of love
[2:19:44] and humility.
[2:19:46] You watch that man.
[2:19:51] He has love.
[2:19:53] He's a good charitable longsuffering.
[2:19:58] You can talk about him. It's all right.
[2:20:02] He forgives you.
[2:20:04] Don't make any difference to him.
[2:20:08] It doesn't make any difference to him.
[2:20:11] But some of you, you are here in this
[2:20:13] church. You You developed a disliking
[2:20:16] for somebody
[2:20:19] to the extent that you can't stand them.
[2:20:22] anything to do with them is a no go for
[2:20:25] you.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; You need to be born again.
[2:20:29] You see, but says this man, this
[2:20:32] Christian man or woman
[2:20:35] no matter what you do to them,
[2:20:38] Amen. He forgives you. It doesn't make a
[2:20:40] difference.
[2:20:42] That's the real man.
[2:20:44] Keep your eye on him.
[2:20:47] That man bears. He's an example.
[2:20:51] Oh, do we have examples in our church
[2:20:53] this morning
[2:20:55] of people who will have real genuine
[2:20:58] love,
[2:21:00] no matter what you do to them, they
[2:21:03] won't mark you.
[2:21:05] Say this one.
[2:21:11] If he's a preacher, you say, "Brother
[2:21:13] Marvin, come. Brother Marvin is going to
[2:21:16] minister for us
[2:21:18] this afternoon.
[2:21:21] God bless you brother Mav you know you
[2:21:23] are not yet married.
[2:21:26] So and then brother Marvin the moment he
[2:21:29] comes
[2:21:35] if you don't walk out
[2:21:38] you will not even say amen.
[2:21:40] You live in those intentionally.
[2:21:45] This one let him talk to others.
[2:21:49] But for me
[2:21:53] will suffer with you. Wake up sister.
[2:21:56] Wake up brother
[2:22:00] because that one is saying also with
[2:22:04] what he did to me. Let me tell you you
[2:22:07] are not God. Oh.
[2:22:12] But even God is love.
[2:22:15] So if you are God, then you must love.
[2:22:19] Unless you are Satan or his child, then
[2:22:23] you will hate them forever.
[2:22:26] But I believe I'm talking to children of
[2:22:27] God.
[2:22:29] Forgive them.
[2:22:32] Love them regardless.
[2:22:34] Let me tell you, love heals.
[2:22:37] When you live in love, you don't love
[2:22:40] stress.
[2:22:42] No wonder many of you have sleep
[2:22:44] problems.
[2:22:45] [Music]
[2:22:47] In this generation, many younger people
[2:22:50] sleep problems.
[2:22:52] Why? They are filled with
[2:22:56] they are getting sicknesses of old
[2:22:58] people.
[2:23:00] They take grudges every time. They never
[2:23:03] forgive. They are always bitter. They
[2:23:06] always s they always
[2:23:11] relax yourself.
[2:23:13] Forgive and see the experience.
[2:23:16] When you forgive and you genuinely love
[2:23:20] you will always live happy.
[2:23:23] When you come in church you will be
[2:23:25] happy when you go outside. You will be
[2:23:28] happy. Brother sister you don't have any
[2:23:32] reason to remain sad.
[2:23:35] when you have received this message
[2:23:37] because this messenger brought down the
[2:23:40] capstone.
[2:23:42] This messenger
[2:23:44] the cornerstone
[2:23:46] what is it is the message of the seven
[2:23:49] sons.
[2:23:51] What did it do perfect life?
[2:23:56] He has given a bright access
[2:23:59] to all of God. You have no reason to
[2:24:02] remain sad.
[2:24:05] And the devil is inflict afflicting you
[2:24:07] with the with the demons of Lady
[2:24:11] because you accepting it.
[2:24:13] Satan cannot love.
[2:24:16] But God is love.
[2:24:20] If you're a child of God, you will have
[2:24:23] love. But if you're a child of Satan,
[2:24:27] like Cain, you will never have love.
[2:24:33] Hallelujah.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; You have prepared for us.
[2:24:42] Now listen,
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; types of love.
[2:24:46] Amen.
[2:24:50] Is what I'm talking about.
[2:24:52] That's the genuine love.
[2:24:54] The only love.
[2:24:58] Yeah. Divine love. But out of that
[2:25:02] it goes reducing
[2:25:07] from aap
[2:25:10] from
[2:25:11] to to lust and filth and all the
[2:25:15] perversions
[2:25:17] but people called them love.
[2:25:21] You listen to this quote in the message
[2:25:22] he must be born again.
[2:25:25] Anything that had a beginning has an
[2:25:27] end.
[2:25:29] It is those things which have not a
[2:25:30] beginning has an end.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You said it right. Did
[2:25:38] you ever think of that?
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; God the great master
[2:25:43] rainbow in the skies.
[2:25:46] [Music]
[2:25:48] God the master rainbow in the skies.
[2:25:52] We will say it like that with the seven
[2:25:55] spirits of God
[2:25:58] read.
[2:25:59] And then he says perfect love. After
[2:26:02] that comes love
[2:26:06] from
[2:26:08] love. That's the love that you have for
[2:26:11] your wife.
[2:26:14] Now many people think that's the love
[2:26:16] you should have for your wife.
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:22] No, if you love her only with
[2:26:28] it will not only fail
[2:26:32] but you will hurt others in that in the
[2:26:34] process.
[2:26:37] I'll show you. I'll continue reading.
[2:26:39] You'll understand.
[2:26:41] If some man would insult her,
[2:26:46] you would shoot his brains out.
[2:26:50] That's f love
[2:26:54] because it creates a jealousy.
[2:26:59] Some people when they love somebody,
[2:27:00] they don't want others to love them.
[2:27:04] Oh, no one can love that person.
[2:27:10] It is me only. And we all have that kind
[2:27:12] of love.
[2:27:14] It's not the genuine love that I'm
[2:27:16] talking about.
[2:27:18] perverted.
[2:27:20] Children have it and oh you know
[2:27:23] everyone is jealousy of another daddy
[2:27:26] has done that for you. What about mine?
[2:27:30] If you don't have it there is no
[2:27:32] happiness in that household. Why?
[2:27:34] Because of jealousy
[2:27:36] and and that's what you finding in
[2:27:37] couples also.
[2:27:40] And that's what we can have as humans.
[2:27:44] It creates a jealousy but that's love
[2:27:48] secondary secondary love.
[2:27:51] Then after that comes lust
[2:27:55] but you see we always we call fellow
[2:27:57] love.
[2:27:58] Yeah, you know there are many categories
[2:28:00] family love what this and that but it's
[2:28:02] all f
[2:28:05] you know um you know the I love my
[2:28:07] mother I love I I love you I love the
[2:28:12] brothers I love the sisters I love my
[2:28:14] children I love my wife but you see we
[2:28:17] using human love
[2:28:19] but also people have another kind of
[2:28:21] love
[2:28:23] when he sees a girl that is moving
[2:28:26] this old lustful boy,
[2:28:30] you'll say, "Ah, I love that guy. I love
[2:28:34] that guy." They will not sleep that
[2:28:36] night
[2:28:38] thinking about it. What is it? Is it
[2:28:41] love? No. It is lust.
[2:28:45] It's not love.
[2:28:48] It's lust. And some sisters also can
[2:28:52] have it. And some of them cannot even
[2:28:55] rest until they tell the boys
[2:28:56] themselves.
[2:28:59] These days I can't even go say brother
[2:29:02] when are you getting married
[2:29:05] don't you see you're growing
[2:29:07] [Music]
[2:29:09] the sister is meaning something
[2:29:15] you see it's lust
[2:29:18] it's perverted love
[2:29:21] it's not genuine
[2:29:23] all right are you following me now okay
[2:29:26] then that's last for another man's wife.
[2:29:30] Then comes filth. After that, then comes
[2:29:33] filth.
[2:29:36] You've had the same sex marriages and
[2:29:37] all that kind of thing.
[2:29:40] And they say they love each other.
[2:29:44] What kind of love? Filth.
[2:29:48] It just becomes perverted.
[2:29:51] Others they say they love their animal
[2:29:55] and they love them, marry them and even
[2:29:59] be with all their wealth to them.
[2:30:02] It's just perversion in the name of
[2:30:05] love. These people can cry
[2:30:10] and they're genuine. You can see it's
[2:30:12] real.
[2:30:13] It is real. They're not faking it.
[2:30:18] Lust is real.
[2:30:21] I hope I'm not talking to rocks and
[2:30:22] angels.
[2:30:25] If you have ever had lust, you know it
[2:30:28] is real.
[2:30:32] It's not a joke. You feel it literally.
[2:30:37] I know it because I've felt it before.
[2:30:40] You feel it. It pains you so heavy.
[2:30:46] I love that person.
[2:30:50] If they refuse make
[2:30:55] it real,
[2:30:57] right? It it is not a joke.
[2:31:00] So is the love you have for your wife is
[2:31:02] real.
[2:31:04] You love you can even shoot somebody
[2:31:07] who touches I can shoot them.
[2:31:11] Why? Because you are you are jealous
[2:31:13] because of love.
[2:31:16] But you see even the the the perversion
[2:31:19] the other perversions
[2:31:23] is also called love.
[2:31:26] You find someone buying a prostitute.
[2:31:30] They don't buy any prostitute.
[2:31:33] They buy the one they love.
[2:31:37] Right? So it's a love perverted love
[2:31:41] perversion. But you see, brother Bam
[2:31:44] says it's all coming from the original.
[2:31:49] There is an original love, brother,
[2:31:51] sister.
[2:31:53] It's called divine love.
[2:31:56] It's called love.
[2:32:01] Praise God.
[2:32:03] But all of this kind of love had a
[2:32:05] beginning.
[2:32:07] But when that real genuine love of God
[2:32:12] that I've been talking about comes into
[2:32:15] the human being.
[2:32:19] How does it come into the human being?
[2:32:22] It comes by the new birth.
[2:32:27] In this we know that you are pass from
[2:32:30] death to life
[2:32:33] if you have love for one another.
[2:32:36] This kind of love can only come into
[2:32:38] your heart
[2:32:40] by the new birth.
[2:32:44] Being born again, it had no beginning,
[2:32:48] you would have no end. You are the son
[2:32:51] of God. You are the daughter of God. And
[2:32:55] your affections
[2:32:57] are on things above.
[2:33:01] Love would make you shoot a man for
[2:33:03] insulting your wife.
[2:33:08] But love would make you pray
[2:33:12] for his lost soul.
[2:33:15] That's the difference.
[2:33:19] Oh, may God give us that.
[2:33:23] Praise God.
[2:33:25] Many times filth is mistaken for love.
[2:33:32] And it says young Christian, a young
[2:33:34] Christian the other day, bunch of
[2:33:36] people.
[2:33:38] I don't say they are not Christians. But
[2:33:41] in looking at some pictures,
[2:33:43] Christian women, Christian men,
[2:33:46] all lovable one and around one another
[2:33:51] in bathing suits, in swimming.
[2:33:56] It is they said, "Oh, that's real love.
[2:34:01] That's real filth.
[2:34:04] It's not love. Love is expressed
[2:34:07] different from that.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That you know they do it in
[2:34:15] those churches.
[2:34:17] You know which song they sing before
[2:34:19] they say
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; before they tell you argue your sister
[2:34:28] in church
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; song leader which song do they sing
[2:34:33] bring songs bring this song then go
[2:34:34] around go around go around
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; there is a song they bring and then they
[2:34:37] move around to look for who they and
[2:34:39] then they say okay now hug your brother
[2:34:42] hug your sister and they said one who is
[2:34:45] close to you.
[2:34:49] No, no. They said the one who is close
[2:34:52] suddenly you'll always sit next to the
[2:34:54] person that you love.
[2:34:58] That's lust.
[2:35:00] And then when the song comes, they call
[2:35:03] it free love.
[2:35:06] In many of these our churches today,
[2:35:09] audition churches. Free love.
[2:35:14] Okay. Hug your sister. Hug your brother.
[2:35:18] And then you find Brother Dixon.
[2:35:25] Say love. I love her.
[2:35:27] Is that love? That's lust. That's filth.
[2:35:32] That's why even in our church, if you've
[2:35:34] noticed, we do not hug sisters.
[2:35:38] Sisters don't hug brothers.
[2:35:40] Brother said this. He said, "No matter
[2:35:43] what you claim to be, brother,
[2:35:45] if you're filled with the Holy Ghost,
[2:35:48] you will not do that." Because you see,
[2:35:52] when you do that,
[2:35:54] as long as you are a man
[2:35:57] and you have blood in your veins,
[2:36:00] you will not feel the same way
[2:36:02] afterwards.
[2:36:06] Therefore, we don't do it.
[2:36:10] We love our sisters.
[2:36:13] Praise God.
[2:36:16] I have 20 minutes now. Let's see in
[2:36:17] Matthew 26. I I thought I will finish
[2:36:19] but I'm seeing almost I may not finish.
[2:36:21] But let let's see. Matthew 26:31.
[2:36:25] Then said Jesus unto them. Let's try to
[2:36:29] take an example of somebody who thought
[2:36:31] they had love.
[2:36:35] And all of you shall be offended because
[2:36:37] of me this night.
[2:36:41] For it is written, I will smite the
[2:36:42] shepherd, and the sheep and the sheep of
[2:36:44] the flock shall be scattered.
[2:36:48] But after that, I am risen again,
[2:36:51] I will go before you into Galilee."
[2:36:54] Peter answered and said unto him,
[2:36:57] though all men shall be offended because
[2:36:59] of thee,
[2:37:01] yet I
[2:37:03] will not be offended. I will never be
[2:37:06] offended.
[2:37:11] until
[2:37:13] I will follow you.
[2:37:15] Some of you brothers, you are here. You
[2:37:18] are looking at me either before or now.
[2:37:21] I don't know.
[2:37:23] You are very busy promising God like
[2:37:25] that
[2:37:27] and you never fulfilled it.
[2:37:31] When they ask you what happened,
[2:37:33] I don't know. I don't know. I don't know
[2:37:36] what was on me, but
[2:37:39] But but I'm no longer feeling like that.
[2:37:44] But when they were telling you, you are
[2:37:46] saying you don't know how I'm feeling.
[2:37:48] You don't
[2:37:50] like Samson came
[2:37:53] and he told his parents daddy mommy get
[2:37:57] me that girl.
[2:37:59] Get her for me. Marry her for me. They
[2:38:04] said no my brother our son that is a
[2:38:08] Philistine you cannot marry for
[2:38:10] unbeliever
[2:38:12] I love her
[2:38:15] get off for me so if you are like that
[2:38:19] and you are loving an unbeliever
[2:38:22] and you I'm not saying it is not genuine
[2:38:26] it is genuinely taking you to hell
[2:38:32] it is a feeling
[2:38:34] which can wear off
[2:38:38] and I assure you after getting married
[2:38:39] to them
[2:38:42] then real life will happen
[2:38:45] and in real life you don't need that
[2:38:48] feeling only
[2:38:50] you need more than that feeling
[2:38:53] you need true genuine God in your life
[2:38:58] because it's the only thing that can
[2:39:00] keep your marriage together.
[2:39:05] Praise God.
[2:39:08] Samson thought he loved each other with
[2:39:10] Delila,
[2:39:12] but he was shocked
[2:39:15] to see what the was doing.
[2:39:18] I am sure we don't see him calling about
[2:39:20] Delila, talking about her afterwards.
[2:39:26] the the love he had for her disappeared
[2:39:30] the moment he was betrayed
[2:39:34] the moment she betrayed him.
[2:39:36] But if it was God is love,
[2:39:40] we would have seen Samson on the pillars
[2:39:44] saying the liar come and help me my love
[2:39:48] let us kill this Philistine.
[2:39:50] But he was there dying by himself.
[2:39:54] He didn't even remember her.
[2:39:56] He remembered God
[2:39:59] is a true love.
[2:40:02] He said, "Oh God, let me die with my
[2:40:05] enemy.
[2:40:07] Give me this one more chance
[2:40:11] once more, Lord."
[2:40:13] And maybe you are also entangled with a
[2:40:15] delina.
[2:40:18] Oh, some other unbelieving, you know,
[2:40:21] boy.
[2:40:23] Let me tell you, you will wake up when
[2:40:24] it's too late.
[2:40:27] And we see here that Peter also felt
[2:40:30] that way.
[2:40:32] Jesus said all of you will leave me.
[2:40:36] Peter said me maybe Julius and
[2:40:43] somebody but me.
[2:40:47] You are joking.
[2:40:49] Where you go I will go.
[2:40:52] Even if they take you to b you I will
[2:40:54] go.
[2:40:56] We shall be together. Jesus. Me. Me.
[2:40:59] Look at me. Trust me.
[2:41:05] Some of you want us to trust you like
[2:41:06] that.
[2:41:08] We know better not to trust you like
[2:41:10] that.
[2:41:12] Because the Bible says it has to be a
[2:41:13] man who trust in a man.
[2:41:16] Let me tell you, don't trust your fellow
[2:41:19] human being.
[2:41:21] Trust in God.
[2:41:24] He can never fail you because God is
[2:41:26] love. If you have God in your heart and
[2:41:30] the person has God in their heart,
[2:41:33] you don't love them but you love the God
[2:41:34] in them. Hallelujah.
[2:41:36] [Music]
[2:41:39] Then you get married to them. Then love
[2:41:42] will be wonderful.
[2:41:45] Amen. Amen. Jesus said unto him,
[2:41:48] "Verily, I say unto you, Peter,
[2:41:51] this night
[2:41:53] before the
[2:41:56] you will deny me three times."
[2:41:58] Peter said unto him,
[2:42:02] "Though I should die,
[2:42:05] Jesus, forget about what you're saying.
[2:42:08] Though I should die with you,
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; I will not deny thee.
[2:42:16] And the disciples heard it. They said,
[2:42:19] "Even me, Jesus. Even me. Even me. Even
[2:42:22] me. I have a question for you." Do you
[2:42:24] think they were lying?
[2:42:27] They were not lying. They were not
[2:42:29] joking. They not playing around. They
[2:42:32] meant it.
[2:42:35] That little boy who is telling you, "I
[2:42:36] love you."
[2:42:38] And you can even shed a few tears.
[2:42:44] I told you
[2:42:46] I can't even sleep because
[2:42:50] the love I have for you, it's very
[2:42:53] genuine.
[2:42:55] Can't you see? I'm even losing weight.
[2:43:00] I love you very much. They are genuine.
[2:43:04] Like Peter was genuine.
[2:43:07] He said, "Even if others leave your own,
[2:43:10] even if I should die,
[2:43:12] He was feeling like that. That was human
[2:43:16] life.
[2:43:20] But afterward
[2:43:23] something happened.
[2:43:25] Amen. Vers 69. Now Peter sat without in
[2:43:30] the palace.
[2:43:32] And Adams came unto him,
[2:43:36] saying, "Thou also was with Jesus of
[2:43:38] Galilee.
[2:43:43] But he was now seeing how Jesus was
[2:43:45] being beatenh
[2:43:51] who
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; you
[2:43:56] don't know what you are saying
[2:43:58] me with Jesus
[2:44:00] me Peter
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; verse 71
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; and when he was gone out where is the
[2:44:08] scripture and when he was gone out
[2:44:11] into the porch.
[2:44:13] Another maid saw him and he said unto
[2:44:17] them that were there,
[2:44:19] this fellow also was with Jesus of
[2:44:21] Nazareth.
[2:44:24] And again he denied
[2:44:28] with an oath.
[2:44:31] I do not know this man.
[2:44:38] I swear
[2:44:41] I've never seen this man.
[2:44:48] What happened to him?
[2:44:51] Brother Peter, God bless you.
[2:44:57] Oh, you have two Peters there.
[2:45:00] Another Peter was not responding.
[2:45:05] This is what Peter did. Don't do it.
[2:45:12] And again he denied with an oath.
[2:45:17] I do not know this man.
[2:45:19] And after a while
[2:45:22] came on him the
[2:45:24] unto him they that stood by.
[2:45:27] And they said to Peter, Surely
[2:45:31] thou also are one of them.
[2:45:34] You are one of them. Your speech betrays
[2:45:37] you.
[2:45:40] You are speaking as a believer.
[2:45:43] Even your tongue the way you are not
[2:45:45] cursing like us.
[2:45:50] If you are one of them, you used to
[2:45:52] attend DVM.
[2:45:54] You are one of them. You you you are
[2:45:57] following him. You are speaking like
[2:45:59] this. Then Peter now said, "Oh, the
[2:46:02] problem is my speech.
[2:46:06] All right. Then began he to curse
[2:46:10] and to swear
[2:46:12] saying, "I know not the man."
[2:46:15] Now I don't know how to cuss. I would
[2:46:17] cuss a little bit.
[2:46:19] But he started cursing. I don't even
[2:46:22] know how the words came.
[2:46:25] He began speaking all the vulgar words
[2:46:27] you could think of.
[2:46:31] And as soon as he said that,
[2:46:35] Peter remembered.
[2:46:42] He remembered the words of Jesus. He
[2:46:44] quickly learn to the wall. He said,
[2:46:46] "Master, father, have mercy. Remember
[2:46:49] me. Forgive me." And that's what a child
[2:46:52] of God does
[2:46:54] when you falter.
[2:46:57] Praise God. What was wrong with Peter?
[2:47:01] Peter was not the seed of of the
[2:47:03] serpent,
[2:47:05] but Peter was not born again here.
[2:47:10] Peter did not have the Holy Ghost
[2:47:14] without the Holy Ghost. You cannot have
[2:47:17] perfect life.
[2:47:21] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:47:24] You needed to see Peter.
[2:47:28] you know, Jesus, you know, rose again
[2:47:30] and died and rose again. But you see,
[2:47:34] before they met with the disciples,
[2:47:37] Peter is one of those that said, "You
[2:47:39] know what?
[2:47:41] After repenting, after everything,
[2:47:45] Jesus has now died and rose again."
[2:47:47] Peter said, "For me, I'm going to go
[2:47:50] back and fish."
[2:47:52] He went back to fish.
[2:47:55] Think about it.
[2:47:57] This is a man who is unstable
[2:48:00] without the Holy Ghost. If if you if you
[2:48:03] don't have the Holy Spirit,
[2:48:06] let let us face it.
[2:48:09] If you don't have the Holy Spirit,
[2:48:12] it will be difficult for you to be
[2:48:13] stable in your Christianity.
[2:48:18] You can never have pure love
[2:48:22] that I've talked about.
[2:48:24] It is impossible.
[2:48:27] You need to have that experience.
[2:48:31] You need to have the hunger.
[2:48:33] You go in prayer. You ask God to fill
[2:48:36] you with the Holy Ghost
[2:48:39] because it is possible. But you are not
[2:48:42] filled yet.
[2:48:44] And that's why you are the way you are.
[2:48:47] This is how Peter was. But Peter went in
[2:48:50] the presence on the day of Pentecost.
[2:48:54] You know before that Jesus comes and
[2:48:56] meets him and and and he found them
[2:48:59] fishing.
[2:49:01] Imagine and as a good shepherd he still
[2:49:05] picked him
[2:49:07] and he brought them back again started
[2:49:09] eating with them. This is after the
[2:49:11] resurrection I don't have time to read
[2:49:13] it in the book of John 21. And then at
[2:49:16] that time you know he tells them he asks
[2:49:19] them three questions.
[2:49:21] Each time he ask them the same question.
[2:49:24] Peter, Peter, lovest thou me?
[2:49:27] Lovest thou me? Lovest thou me? Because
[2:49:30] he was not filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:49:33] He was even offended
[2:49:35] because of the way he was asked.
[2:49:38] So why are you asking me all this time?
[2:49:42] But wait until Peter received the Holy
[2:49:46] Ghost on the day of Pentecost.
[2:49:50] That was the defining moment.
[2:49:54] All fear left, the bad behaviors left,
[2:49:58] the old envy left,
[2:50:00] those things left.
[2:50:03] And Peter was new.
[2:50:06] He did not now have any more fear.
[2:50:09] He could preach the word without fear of
[2:50:11] favor
[2:50:13] on the day of Pentecost. And they
[2:50:15] baptized 3,000
[2:50:19] in the name of our Lord Jesus. Think
[2:50:21] about it, friends.
[2:50:23] But yet, Peter confessed love.
[2:50:27] Give me that, brother. This is just
[2:50:28] going to be um I'm just climaxing here
[2:50:31] right now.
[2:50:33] You see, Peter confessed love to Jesus,
[2:50:37] but he didn't have it yet.
[2:50:40] So, you can confess love,
[2:50:42] but you may not have it yet.
[2:50:45] You need to come to Pentecost.
[2:50:51] Praise God.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; Can I try to make this a little bit
[2:50:54] bigger, bigger, bigger? Just make it
[2:50:56] bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. Okay.
[2:50:59] So, this is the stage of a perfect man.
[2:51:04] And I don't have time to go through
[2:51:05] everything.
[2:51:07] But you try and and listen to the
[2:51:08] message, the stage of a perfect man.
[2:51:13] You see, um, the prophet lays it down.
[2:51:18] This is taken out of second Peter rather
[2:51:20] second Peter chapter 1.
[2:51:23] We will not read there. But then he he
[2:51:26] gives he gives us the building uh uh uh
[2:51:28] um the the the levels of the building of
[2:51:31] the body of Christ.
[2:51:36] But you see what I wanted where I wanted
[2:51:38] to get to
[2:51:40] show you is the capstone
[2:51:44] is love. The bond of perfection.
[2:51:50] You see it says building this monument,
[2:51:53] building this sture. It starts off with
[2:51:56] the foundation stone,
[2:51:59] faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[2:52:02] patience, posess, brotherly kindness.
[2:52:05] Now what does it do? Then we are waiting
[2:52:08] for the headstone
[2:52:10] which is love. For God is love and he
[2:52:15] controls and he is the strength of every
[2:52:17] one of these things
[2:52:21] right in here, right in here. You see, I
[2:52:23] I got in between all these works in here
[2:52:25] and here these little waves come. What
[2:52:27] was that? The Holy Ghost coming down
[2:52:29] through Christ Holy Spirit. The Holy
[2:52:32] Spirit is above all this
[2:52:36] welding this together building a perfect
[2:52:39] church
[2:52:42] for the capstone to capital.
[2:52:46] The dynamics of this church will be
[2:52:48] revealing of the Holy Spirit
[2:52:51] that we have worked in a small measure
[2:52:54] while the headstone is coming down to
[2:52:56] unite with the body.
[2:53:03] But when that headstone and the body
[2:53:05] unites together,
[2:53:10] the full power of the Holy Ghost
[2:53:13] would raise her up.
[2:53:16] That's exactly like that.
[2:53:19] Even the head, the dead, the stay in
[2:53:21] Christ
[2:53:23] for hundreds of years ago, they will
[2:53:26] rise in the beauty of his holy name.
[2:53:29] And it has lifted
[2:53:32] me now safe.
[2:53:38] My
[2:53:39] love lifted me.
[2:53:44] Lift.
[2:53:48] Love. Lifted me. Love.
[2:53:53] Lifted
[2:53:55] me.
[2:53:57] Oh love
[2:54:01] lifted
[2:54:03] me when nothing
[2:54:07] went
[2:54:09] nothing
[2:54:11] else.
[2:54:14] Oh love
[2:54:17] lifted
[2:54:19] me.
[2:54:21] Love
[2:54:25] lifted
[2:54:26] me.
[2:54:28] [Music]
[2:54:29] Oh
[2:54:31] love
[2:54:33] lifted
[2:54:35] me. Oh, and nothing
[2:54:39] went
[2:54:40] and nothing
[2:54:43] else.
[2:54:44] You have all
[2:54:49] lifted
[2:54:50] me.
[2:54:54] If you feel you do not have this love,
[2:54:59] remember the only way is that you
[2:55:01] receive the Holy Spirit.
[2:55:04] Why don't you take a moment
[2:55:07] and ask God to remember you now?
[2:55:11] [Music]
[2:55:13] This is a so moment,
[2:55:18] I always know one thing that when the
[2:55:20] word is preached,
[2:55:23] God comes behind that word
[2:55:28] to vindicate that is the truth.
[2:55:33] So, I'd like you to believe that God is
[2:55:35] here.
[2:55:39] There's no reason for you to be bitter
[2:55:41] in your heart.
[2:55:45] When a person becomes bitter in their
[2:55:47] heart,
[2:55:49] they drive away every beat of the spirit
[2:55:52] of God.
[2:55:56] Your home becomes bitter.
[2:56:00] You become toxic
[2:56:02] in your words.
[2:56:04] People begin to dislike you.
[2:56:08] People begin to feel there's an attitude
[2:56:09] around you.
[2:56:12] Because you do not have this love
[2:56:16] because where this love is not there is
[2:56:18] bitterness.
[2:56:20] There is hatred.
[2:56:23] Remember we are going into the rapture.
[2:56:26] That's our goal.
[2:56:29] But how is your heart?
[2:56:32] What is the state of your heart?
[2:56:36] What about at your workplace?
[2:56:39] Are you the salt of the earth?
[2:56:42] Have you been an example?
[2:56:45] If only God can give you love,
[2:56:50] you'll bring many souls to the kingdom
[2:56:53] because they will talk to you and they
[2:56:55] will test. they will see that salt.
[2:57:01] I wonder if each of us
[2:57:05] can have a moment
[2:57:07] of real soul prayer,
[2:57:13] talking to the Lord.
[2:57:16] I'm talking over this issue with you
[2:57:20] because you know your situation.
[2:57:24] In such moment I expect everybody to be
[2:57:26] reverent.
[2:57:29] If you could please close your eyes,
[2:57:32] kneel somewhere,
[2:57:34] lift up your hand,
[2:57:37] stand somewhere,
[2:57:39] whatever it is, but talk to the Lord
[2:57:42] with all sincerity
[2:57:45] and say, "Lord,
[2:57:47] I need you to fill me.
[2:57:49] I'm asking you to feel
[2:57:52] because I want to have this love
[2:57:55] that men shall know I am your disciple.
[2:58:00] Lord help me
[2:58:03] run in this race.
[2:58:06] While the pianist plays
[2:58:09] and the organists,
[2:58:12] let each of us go in prayer now
[2:58:16] and speak to the Lord.
[2:58:22] [Music]
[2:58:26] Oh Lord Jesus,
[2:58:29] [Music]
[2:59:38] [Music]
[3:00:15] [Music]
[3:01:02] [Music]
[3:01:59] when I needed
[3:02:03] to forgive
[3:02:05] those who hurt me.
[3:02:08] [Music]
[3:02:10] I couldn't do it
[3:02:14] even to those
[3:02:17] that haunt me.
[3:02:20] [Music]
[3:02:22] But when his grace
[3:02:26] found me
[3:02:28] so wretched,
[3:02:30] poor and blind,
[3:02:33] I couldn't help him but to say
[3:02:38] I forgive
[3:02:44] when I needed
[3:02:47] to forgive
[3:02:49] all those who hurt me. me.
[3:02:55] I couldn't do it even to those
[3:03:01] that haunt me.
[3:03:06] But then his grace
[3:03:10] found me
[3:03:12] so wretched,
[3:03:15] poor, and blind.
[3:03:17] I couldn't help it
[3:03:20] but to say
[3:03:23] I forgive.
[3:03:29] I am free
[3:03:31] from the castle
[3:03:34] of tomorrow.
[3:03:39] Now I am free
[3:03:43] from the sins
[3:03:45] of my past.
[3:03:51] I have Jesus
[3:03:54] who has changed my whole life.
[3:03:59] Praise God.
[3:04:02] I am free.
[3:04:04] Praise the Lord.
[3:04:07] I am free.
[3:04:12] Oh, when I needed
[3:04:15] to forgive
[3:04:17] all those who hurt me,
[3:04:23] I couldn't do it
[3:04:26] even to those
[3:04:29] that haunt me.
[3:04:33] But then his grace
[3:04:37] just found me. so wretched
[3:04:43] and blind.
[3:04:45] I couldn't help it
[3:04:48] but to say
[3:04:51] I forgive.
[3:04:54] So now oh I am free
[3:04:59] from the cancel
[3:05:02] of tomorrow.
[3:05:05] Hallelujah.
[3:05:07] Well, I am free
[3:05:10] from the sins
[3:05:13] of the past.
[3:05:17] Well, I know I have Jesus.
[3:05:22] For he has changed my whole life.
[3:05:27] [Music]
[3:05:29] Oh, I am free.
[3:05:33] Praise the Lord.
[3:05:36] I am free.
[3:05:38] [Music]
[3:05:43] Hallelujah.
[3:05:45] Hallelujah.
[3:05:48] Touching Jesus
[3:05:51] is all that really matters.
[3:05:56] Let us sing it together, saints.
[3:05:59] And your life
[3:06:01] will never be
[3:06:04] the same.
[3:06:10] There is only
[3:06:13] only one way
[3:06:17] to touch.
[3:06:20] [Music]
[3:06:22] People hurt us,
[3:06:25] but then we died.
[3:06:28] We no longer live. So we no longer hold
[3:06:31] any cry.
[3:06:36] That's the level we want to get to
[3:06:39] where Jesus,
[3:06:42] the love of Jesus can be shared abroad
[3:06:44] in our hearts
[3:06:48] where we can truly see families united,
[3:06:54] homes united,
[3:06:58] believers united,
[3:07:01] truly and genuinely loving each other
[3:07:03] with the love of God.
[3:07:06] [Music]
[3:07:08] And even here, Lord, before we go,
[3:07:12] perhaps there is somebody who has made a
[3:07:14] resolution,
[3:07:16] I'm going to let everything go,
[3:07:20] I open my heart for the love of God.
[3:07:24] that even before they leave this place,
[3:07:27] Lord, that they will be able to meet
[3:07:28] somebody
[3:07:30] that hurt them or somebody that they
[3:07:33] hurt
[3:07:35] and truly apologize
[3:07:38] as a Christian gentleman, Christian men
[3:07:41] and women, as we have heard in the world
[3:07:44] today,
[3:07:45] that love
[3:07:48] beareth all things,
[3:07:50] [Music]
[3:07:52] endureth all things,
[3:07:54] believeth all things that a brother will
[3:07:57] come and tell a brother I am sorry
[3:08:00] and a brother will take it and receive
[3:08:03] it with all their heart.
[3:08:05] Perhaps somebody that is out of here
[3:08:08] that they will call their husband or
[3:08:10] their wife
[3:08:14] and truly forgive them.
[3:08:17] Lord, we know that the world will hate
[3:08:18] us nonetheless,
[3:08:22] but that does not change who we are.
[3:08:26] We cannot allow the world to bring us to
[3:08:28] their level
[3:08:31] because their level is hatred.
[3:08:34] Their level is revenge.
[3:08:38] Their level is all these worldly kind of
[3:08:40] things.
[3:08:43] But our level is God.
[3:08:45] The Bible says we are seated in heavenly
[3:08:47] places
[3:08:49] with Christ Jesus. A place where we are
[3:08:52] walking in the realm of the
[3:08:53] supernatural,
[3:08:56] where God is love and God is in us and
[3:09:00] we are in God. A place where we will
[3:09:03] love everybody.
[3:09:06] Oh, this Holy Ghost gospel
[3:09:09] will make us love everybody.
[3:09:12] everybody
[3:09:14] if someone is not to that level Lord.
[3:09:18] My prayer Lord is that you would bring
[3:09:19] us to that
[3:09:22] to to an extent where they asked brother
[3:09:24] Billy Paul
[3:09:27] what's your greatest the greatest
[3:09:29] miracle of your father
[3:09:31] [Music]
[3:09:33] said you could not differentiate his
[3:09:34] enemies from his friends
[3:09:38] [Music]
[3:09:40] I discern and I ask myself
[3:09:45] am I at that level Yet
[3:09:48] is my brother, my sister here today
[3:09:52] at that level. Yet we realize that Lord
[3:09:55] love does not mean that we will not get
[3:09:58] angry,
[3:10:01] but that we should forgive.
[3:10:04] We should not hold things in our hearts.
[3:10:07] We should let go and let go.
[3:10:10] Father, that's my prayer
[3:10:13] that you will surely come in our hearts
[3:10:14] today.
[3:10:16] That little broken up sermon
[3:10:20] being preached today will mean a world
[3:10:22] to somebody.
[3:10:25] Granted, I pray be with us until we meet
[3:10:28] again
[3:10:30] in Jesus name.
[3:10:33] Amen. God bless you,
[3:10:37] brother. Shalom.
[3:10:39] We'll meet again on Wednesday.
[3:10:45] God bless you. Get this.
[3:10:48] [Music]
