[36:10] amen
[36:12] [Music]
[36:24] praise the lord you come i ever see
[36:27] uh
[36:29] i i'm teaching this evening
[36:34] i was expecting more than i see now but
[36:37] then
[36:38] travis
[36:52] let's go to the book
[37:07] so i'm teaching today on the
[37:09] qualifications and duties of deacons
[37:16] [Music]
[37:19] and so we take
[37:20] acts
[37:27] you know the book of acts is the only
[37:29] book which was written by
[37:32] the holy spirit
[37:45] the only book that
[37:47] is continuous
[38:02] [Music]
[38:28] which means that a man
[38:31] full stop i mean
[38:35] actually i mean means
[38:40] it's like a full stop chilling
[38:43] what has been like when you finish to
[38:44] pray you say
[38:49] but every other book has amen
[38:53] but the book of acts doesn't
[38:56] because
[38:57] there is no full stop on it
[39:05] and the rest of the chapters of that
[39:07] book is being written actually in our
[39:08] lives
[39:24] [Music]
[39:26] when the number of the disciples was
[39:28] much blind there arose a murmuring of
[39:30] the christians against the hebrews
[39:32] because their widows were neglected in
[39:34] the daily administration then the 12th
[39:36] called the multitude of the disciples
[39:38] unto them and said it is not reason that
[39:40] we should leave the word of god and sub
[39:42] tables one of our brethren looking out
[39:45] among you you seven men of honest report
[39:48] full of the holocaust and wisdom whom we
[39:51] may appoint over the this business
[39:54] but we will give ourselves continually
[39:56] to prayer and to the ministry of the
[39:58] world
[40:43] [Music]
[40:55] amen father we just appreciate you for
[40:58] the word which we have read may you
[40:59] bring your spirit upon it tonight as we
[41:01] hear these all the words in jesus christ
[41:18] we may be serious
[41:20] so
[41:21] this evening i'm speaking on the
[41:23] qualifications and the duties of of
[41:25] deacons
[41:45] i'm going to ask you to send this
[41:48] service to them so that they can be able
[41:50] to hear it
[41:54] those who can listen to audio send them
[41:56] audio those who can't send them videos
[42:23] okay amen now
[42:26] we are talking about that so let's just
[42:27] find the right place
[42:30] and so because if you don't understand
[42:32] what they can
[42:33] what you can mean or what beacons mean
[42:36] then you
[42:38] to understand their qualifications and
[42:40] duties might not mean much to you can
[42:42] you go back
[42:48] [Music]
[43:11] or the ascension of our lord jesus
[43:17] and the church had now continued to grow
[43:19] economically
[43:22] initially it was only the 11 disciples
[43:24] that he left behind
[43:30] but then
[43:31] they continued on with nursing and
[43:33] speaking about jesus
[43:38] things were all
[43:40] until at such a time when people became
[43:42] so many two kids
[43:45] and the burden was so heavy on the 11.
[43:50] and so they they told the people because
[43:52] now of course you know when whenever
[43:54] there is a gathering of people
[43:58] now there are things that you cannot
[44:00] avoid what are the way the interview is
[44:03] there are things like money eventually
[44:06] you can't avoid money don't say well
[44:08] because where you have people are thank
[44:11] you
[44:12] that people need to be taken care of
[44:14] better go love it is what people will
[44:17] give and then toward you but what they
[44:19] give needs to be managed
[45:01] but you see as the people became more
[45:03] young
[45:05] also increased
[45:08] and so
[45:09] god now instructed the disciples
[45:14] he says when the number of the disciples
[45:16] meaning the followers of jesus christ
[45:18] were much blind
[45:23] then they arrived a murmuring of the
[45:25] christians against the hebrews
[45:30] city
[46:04] um
[46:06] from the christians they kind of felt
[46:08] that they were neglected
[47:08] you know the congregation is beginning
[47:09] to be larger
[47:12] and the need there is need now
[47:15] a way to go
[47:17] how many agree with me
[47:20] that is true for sure
[47:22] so even so it was in the desire in the
[47:24] in the times of the disciples
[47:28] and so they said well for brethren
[47:32] among you look uh look out seven men
[47:35] mummy
[48:05] and if you want to listen again you can
[48:07] listen again
[48:09] so the number of disciples
[48:12] because i have too much to cover in a
[48:13] very short time usually on wednesday we
[48:15] do an hour
[48:17] so the number of disciples was
[48:18] multiplied that's number one
[48:22] okay man are you following me i mean
[48:25] number two the chocolatey the preaching
[48:27] ministry of where is that he needed to
[48:29] concentrate on prayer
[48:32] and preaching while
[48:37] all right amen
[48:38] that's point number two
[48:40] point number three
[48:42] there was need for support why would we
[48:45] have
[48:46] there was
[48:59] would support the preaching ministry
[49:03] of where is that these men that that he
[49:06] told them to choose
[49:10] their purpose
[49:12] would it be to support the preaching
[49:13] ministry why is
[49:29] businesses
[49:34] so the pastor of the preachers we are
[49:36] not going to be the one handling all
[49:38] those other jokes
[50:05] you see there were seven men because
[50:06] that's what they needed among them at
[50:08] that time
[51:07] happens
[51:13] you also have to start there and preach
[51:17] when you see the pressure becomes too
[51:18] much
[51:22] sometimes you think especially here in
[51:24] africa that you see ministry of church
[51:26] is a one-man ministry no two canola
[51:33] pasta
[51:46] nothing that goes on
[51:52] [Music]
[52:00] you see
[52:01] that is not the right mentality hey you
[52:04] see and there wasn't i believe as a
[52:05] church we need to know
[52:07] what does the bible say
[52:09] what does the message say
[52:12] then what should we do
[52:14] as a child
[52:17] is that right is it a truth
[52:18] amen i mean
[52:20] now
[52:21] i believe here we also have come to that
[52:24] level
[52:30] foreign yeah we need these men
[52:34] these are equals
[52:36] they are the ones who help in those
[52:38] things
[52:44] those are different
[52:48] you need to get in the same speed with
[52:49] me brother today i mean hallelujah amen
[52:52] now
[52:54] um
[52:58] we were we were three then four then
[53:00] five then
[53:01] ten then twenty then
[53:03] [Music]
[53:05] sometimes here we are 60 70.
[53:10] so we need deacons
[53:26] we
[53:34] and uh
[53:36] we'll just i would just stick with the
[53:38] word
[53:40] now
[53:41] i want us to first look at the
[53:42] qualifications
[53:44] okay
[53:47] and then we shall look at the duties
[53:51] i want you to look at uh
[54:00] the whole multitude and they chose
[54:02] stephen a man full of faith and the holy
[54:04] ghost and philip and and progress and
[54:07] nicano and pimon and feminas and nicolas
[54:11] across the light of antioch whom they
[54:13] set before the apostles
[54:17] when they had prayed they laid their
[54:19] hands on them
[54:21] uh
[54:22] have you corrected myself
[54:38] [Music]
[55:00] i'm asking you a question
[55:02] they chose seven
[55:04] women
[55:17] say
[55:33] deacons
[55:36] rather shame
[55:37] understand they have
[55:39] female deacons
[55:42] but according to the apostolic church
[55:45] women they chose what balloon that
[55:48] man massager so according to the
[55:51] apostolic church cathy can you say ever
[55:53] to me there is nothing like women
[55:55] deacons
[56:00] these men were men and nobody
[56:02] not people siban not women
[56:05] but they were men
[56:07] right i mean so we are looking at the
[56:10] qualifications
[56:11] qualification number one the transaction
[56:14] according to what we have read here
[56:16] these were men
[56:19] all right amen so please sister
[56:23] uh sister don't tell us to elect you as
[56:26] a deacon
[56:43] together and say
[56:48] it is not appropriate for us to neglect
[56:50] teaching
[56:55] the word of god in order to stop tables
[56:59] [Music]
[57:01] in order to serve tables
[57:04] and manage
[57:08] love and money
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:53] of the spirit and wisdom i like to do
[57:55] your name again we may put in charge
[57:57] distaste i don't know where you know so
[58:00] now we find out that they also have to
[58:02] have a wholeness report category
[58:20] foreign
[59:05] [Music]
[59:10] all right it says likewise master
[59:11] deacon's big grave not double tanked not
[59:14] given too much wine not greedy or filthy
[59:17] lacquer holding the mystery of the faith
[59:19] in the poor consciousness and let this
[59:21] also first be proved then let them use
[59:23] the office of a deacon being found
[59:25] blameless even so must their wives be
[59:27] grave not slanderers so about faithful
[59:30] in all things not malicious gossips but
[59:32] self-controlled
[59:34] thoroughly trustworthy
[59:37] in all things
[59:38] okay now that is that that bit there i
[59:41] got from the from the amplified you just
[59:43] keep that then says let the deacons be
[59:45] the husbands of one wife ruling their
[59:47] children and their own house as well
[59:55] wherever you never wait is that
[59:58] chibaguan
[1:00:12] [Music]
[1:00:54] meaning servants i believe
[1:00:57] he said
[1:00:58] and he says that uh let the
[1:01:01] beacons
[1:01:03] be
[1:01:03] the
[1:01:06] grave
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:36] who is hearing what i'm saying
[1:01:39] are you all with me my name is
[1:01:44] are you all with me my name is
[1:01:47] so it says let them not be double thanks
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:02] they should also have ability to hold
[1:02:03] the mystery of faith from the
[1:02:17] their wife or his wife or the deacon he
[1:02:20] must she must also be great
[1:02:31] faithful in all things
[1:03:00] what does this let this mean
[1:03:04] a man who has your respect
[1:03:08] he is a honorable man
[1:03:11] financially ethical
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:55] and then he does not you know pay back
[1:03:59] you see he's not an honorable man
[1:04:01] he must be financially ethical
[1:04:05] he must be of a good character
[1:04:08] not a bad character but a good character
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:24] not be double times
[1:04:29] meaning speakers of half-truth
[1:04:34] you see
[1:04:35] how many have seen people who are double
[1:04:36] times
[1:05:20] is not one of the qualifications of
[1:05:22] being a deacon
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:27] many churches especially down here in
[1:05:29] our continent they take people who are
[1:05:32] rich i'm against
[1:05:34] amazing
[1:06:14] is
[1:06:26] he must not be someone who is addicted
[1:06:28] to alcohol died enough
[1:06:52] he must not be greedy
[1:06:55] for this honest gain
[1:06:58] could be into
[1:07:18] [Music]
[1:07:25] but upholding and fully understanding
[1:07:51] someone who
[1:07:52] does not shy away
[1:08:06] someone who knows what he is taught what
[1:08:09] the true message is
[1:08:14] and it does not shy away from it that's
[1:08:16] a question soon
[1:08:18] you know the bible says that i'm not
[1:08:19] ashamed of the gospel
[1:08:49] amen and he's not ashamed of it
[1:08:52] such a person commenting
[1:08:56] hallelujah
[1:08:58] you see
[1:09:00] and
[1:09:01] and he must have full understanding of
[1:09:03] the mystery
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:15] resulting from behavior consistent with
[1:09:18] spiritual maturity
[1:09:27] this man it's not like saying well i
[1:09:30] have a good spirit
[1:10:28] hallelujah amen
[1:10:30] praise the name of the lord
[1:10:33] so now
[1:10:35] this that's why we should appreciate god
[1:10:37] for this anti-message
[1:10:42] because
[1:10:43] anger this message has made many has
[1:10:46] made many things clear
[1:10:49] to be injured in the world out there
[1:10:53] when you find women
[1:10:56] they are placed as different oh sangha
[1:10:58] because
[1:11:00] and yet the bible is clear at the bible
[1:11:04] the bible says even so much their wives
[1:11:24] a woman can also be a deacon
[1:11:28] but according to the kjv
[1:11:31] he says the wife of the deacon
[1:11:38] is
[1:12:20] so
[1:12:44] [Music]
[1:12:49] if he has no qualifications
[1:12:56] so it's not about woman
[1:12:59] about the qualifications of the bible
[1:13:43] that's why we do not need the physical
[1:13:44] body jesus
[1:13:50] he has no new thing to say nothing
[1:13:52] forget about
[1:13:54] the thing he had to say there are
[1:13:55] nothing
[1:13:56] he's right here in
[1:13:58] bible hallelujah amen and that's why you
[1:13:58] on the
[1:14:02] must be happy
[1:14:04] if you receive the revelation of this
[1:14:06] bible
[1:14:08] when you receive the revelation of the
[1:14:09] word no quick quote you gotta receive
[1:14:12] christ from christo amen that's why the
[1:14:15] apostles say
[1:14:16] that to me
[1:14:17] this is an angel who comes from heaven
[1:14:23] and preaches to you
[1:14:26] now
[1:14:55] of god
[1:14:58] we don't take it as a book of
[1:14:59] consultations
[1:15:05] of our faith
[1:15:07] oh god
[1:15:23] that's that god i don't know you know
[1:15:26] the bible bible
[1:15:28] jesus christ
[1:15:33] can you explain for me
[1:15:36] hallelujah
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:45] let the woman land in silence with all
[1:15:47] subjection
[1:16:32] you must not be
[1:16:42] [Applause]
[1:16:46] [Music]
[1:16:56] that
[1:16:57] this god of the bible oh no our
[1:17:00] bible
[1:17:02] that's not discriminate that's so solar
[1:17:06] but also this god of the bible
[1:17:09] does not advocate for
[1:17:11] equality
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:41] [Applause]
[1:17:55] praise the lord so that's the god of the
[1:17:57] bible
[1:17:59] says that a deacon must be a man
[1:18:04] not a woman
[1:18:05] and if he's a man
[1:18:07] just a man
[1:18:33] his wife also must
[1:18:35] be
[1:18:36] uh worthy of respect
[1:18:38] i
[1:18:51] um
[1:19:06] some
[1:19:07] three of my sisters actually many
[1:19:08] sisters
[1:19:09] sister they like gossiping
[1:19:16] you know things come from this home
[1:19:18] again
[1:19:48] she
[1:20:24] you know there are people who love even
[1:20:25] taking things of their bedroom of their
[1:20:28] house out into the public shc
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:44] she must be
[1:21:12] those are the
[1:21:26] foreign
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:23] he says and god has said in the church
[1:22:24] some apostles secondary
[1:22:26] prophets gifts and so forth
[1:22:36] in the church for one purpose
[1:22:39] the perfecting of the body
[1:22:43] and now if you happen to get sick cat is
[1:22:46] single
[1:22:47] whatever you are you're not jody and
[1:22:49] your pastor is a man who believes that
[1:22:52] we should pray for the sick
[1:22:55] your kids
[1:22:57] have him come and pray for him
[1:23:00] but and then if your pastor is not there
[1:23:04] get
[1:23:18] then get
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:45] he actually can't be able to also pray
[1:23:47] for you just like your pastor can pray
[1:23:49] for you if your person is not there
[1:23:52] um
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:56] all right so then i'm just going going
[1:23:59] quickly through it if you i'm also
[1:24:01] recommending you read a message
[1:24:13] um
[1:24:40] and i think that your meeting should not
[1:24:41] be together should not be together but
[1:24:44] it should be as each office because the
[1:24:46] deacons has nothing to say to the
[1:24:48] trustees unless they got some business
[1:24:50] to present to them
[1:25:05] now these deacons
[1:25:07] don't have
[1:25:09] uh
[1:25:10] you know we have the we have different
[1:25:11] offices category in our offices
[1:25:14] we have the offices of the trustees
[1:25:18] and then the office of the deacons

[1:25:50] financial business
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:07] assisting the past
[1:26:09] and so it says that when they are
[1:26:11] meeting
[1:26:14] it doesn't have to be like all the all
[1:26:16] of them made in today
[1:26:34] of the church
[1:26:39] how many are ugandans
[1:26:42] uganda
[1:26:48] hallelujah mean
[1:26:51] how many

[1:43:10] now is there i'm quoting is there any
[1:43:13] better way to keep order in the church

[1:44:32] to keep order in the church with

[1:44:43] out of order in the church who comes in

[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:14] so he screamed for his wife
[1:45:17] and wanted his wife and went up towards
[1:45:18] the past
[1:45:21] and the pastor showed him his wife
[1:45:25] but he was going to shoot her right in
[1:45:26] the church
[1:45:55] if there had been a bunch of deacons
[1:46:04] and entered that door with that shotgun
[1:46:08] they would have had their arms around
[1:46:25] you might just can't expect anything to
[1:46:26] be normal
[1:46:30] but remember
[1:46:32] the deacons are goddess policemen in the
[1:46:34] house of god
[1:46:36] [Music]

[1:46:46] have to go up and make an arrest on
[1:46:48] somebody
[1:46:52] are you doing
[1:47:48] if someone jumps up and starts
[1:47:50] interrupting the pastor
[1:47:53] or something another like that already

[1:49:35] come among you you know and some
[1:49:37] religious fanatic and start carrying on
