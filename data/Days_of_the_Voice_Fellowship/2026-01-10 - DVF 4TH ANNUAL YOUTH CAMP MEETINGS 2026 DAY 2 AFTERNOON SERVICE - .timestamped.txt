[24:24] Hey, are you one of them?
[24:27] &gt;&gt; You know, this is one of the most
[24:28] wonderful songs,
[24:31] you know, because you know, when you
[24:32] look around the room,
[24:34] you're looking at your brother,
[24:37] baptized in Jesus name
[24:40] filled with the Holy Ghost, the bride of
[24:42] Jesus Christ. Amen. Maybe black, blue,
[24:46] red, I don't know, white, but we are all
[24:50] one of them.
[24:52] children of one father
[24:54] who is the Lord. How many are looking
[24:57] forward to the word?
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I just hope you're prayed up and
[25:02] expectant.
[25:05] And you know, I just wanted to say
[25:08] there's only so much you can say to uh
[25:10] to the public, but uh
[25:15] I just wanted to say this.
[25:17] I spent time with brother Josh.
[25:20] He took time off work
[25:23] some time of fellowship
[25:28] back in Brisbane and I can tell you
[25:31] brother Josh
[25:36] and so um it's just wonderful when you
[25:41] know you're going to hear from someone
[25:42] who is one of them.
[25:47] You can say all you want.
[25:50] But your life will show who you are.
[25:54] And the reason why I said that
[25:57] is because after spending I don't know I
[25:59] don't remember how many days perhaps a
[26:00] week or so
[26:03] I could tell he's one of them.
[26:06] Amen. And so [clears throat] let us
[26:07] receive him tonight.
[26:09] Amen. Another refreshing from heaven.
[26:14] We receive him with another song.
[26:18] uh God's attributes were manifested.
[26:23] If the brother can get the original
[26:25] life,
[26:27] this is a wonderful another wonderful
[26:28] story.
[26:31] God's attributes were manifested to his
[26:35] bride in this last age. [music]

[34:03] I bless

[34:08] [music]
[34:13] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[34:15] prayer.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus,
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, what an honor to come before your
[34:21] throne of grace.
[34:23] [music]
[34:24] Lord, we want to thank you for
[34:26] everything you've done this day.
[34:29] But oh God, we want more of you.
[34:34] We want more of you in our lives, Lord.
[34:38] So God, may you come and open up your
[34:40] word to us, Lord.
[34:42] We commit all that's to be said and done
[34:44] into your hands.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Come, oh God, and take control, we ask.
[34:51] In Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen.
[34:56] Amen. God bless you. I'm very nervous,
[35:00] so let's just turn straight to the
[35:01] scripture.
[35:04] If anyone's ever stood at the altar and
[35:07] got married,
[35:11] you're more nervous than your wedding
[35:13] day.
[35:19] I want to read 1 Samuel chapter 16.
[35:25] when brother ti started stealing my
[35:27] sermon yesterday
[35:31] and I was sitting there and I said Lord
[35:33] make him stop
[35:37] &gt;&gt; and then brother Michael
[35:40] &gt;&gt; he preached from Genesis to Revelations
[35:44] and I thought we'll be preaching from
[35:45] the maps in the back
[35:50] and I said Lord is there something left
[35:54] but here Here we are.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 16
[36:01] verse 13. I don't need to read it all.
[36:05] My brother already laid a beautiful
[36:06] groundwork for me.
[36:11] And it says, "Then Samuel took the horn
[36:13] of oil
[36:15] and anointed him in the midst of his
[36:17] brethren, and the spirit of the Lord
[36:19] came upon David from that day forward."
[36:22] So Samuel rose up and went to Rama.
[36:25] Amen.
[36:42] word. You may take your seats.
[36:45] My wife texts me.
[36:48] I said, "I need to slow down for the
[36:49] interpreter.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; So pray for me."
[36:57] I want to really appreciate that message
[36:59] from Brother Michael.
[37:02] I know his life has challenges and
[37:04] hardships.
[37:07] So when he preaches, it comes from a
[37:09] position of experience.
[37:14] And when he was saying they took me to
[37:15] Compala,
[37:18] I had to hold my hand to cross the road.
[37:23] And every eye was on me.
[37:27] There goes this tall redhead man.
[37:31] And they can all see me.
[37:35] Quite the experience.
[37:40] So as we read in the scripture,
[37:44] &gt;&gt; as we know Saul was a backslid, moody,
[37:47] &gt;&gt; jealous,
[37:51] he was a disobedient king,
[37:54] &gt;&gt; even though he was anointed with oil.
[37:58] And as we found out yesterday,
[38:00] the oil never brought him to his
[38:02] purpose.
[38:05] Saul was the one that should have been
[38:07] facing the giant.
[38:10] This was the king. He was the leader. He
[38:14] was head and shoulders above every other
[38:15] man.
[38:18] He was the one with the suit of armor.
[38:20] He was the one that should have been
[38:22] facing Goliath.
[38:25] But because of disobedience,
[38:27] the kingdom was taken away from them.
[38:31] I don't want to be alive and not know
[38:33] why.
[38:36] I want to know the reason that God has
[38:38] placed me on the face of this earth.
[38:42] I don't want to go through life
[38:44] successful in the wrong thing.
[38:49] It doesn't matter how much money I
[38:50] accumulate.
[38:53] Life I never knew him.
[38:58] But I want to speak on facing life with
[39:00] the anointing oil.
[39:04] It's amazing when you look at David.
[39:07] Here's a man that was anointed king
[39:09] around the age of 10 to 15 years old.
[39:14] Young man
[39:17] in front of him.
[39:20] And with the anointing, it came with a
[39:22] realization of his purpose.
[39:26] He could walk out and face the bear, the
[39:29] lion.
[39:31] No, that animal cannot
[39:35] throne my destiny.
[39:39] Scripture, Satan is going to
[39:43] like a roaring lion
[39:47] seeking whom he can devour.
[39:50] But with the anointing
[39:52] in the believer,
[39:54] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN STAND AGAINST THE LION.
[39:57] You can stand against the devil.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; So no matter what comes your way,
[40:05] KNOWING THE THRONE IS MY PURPOSE.
[40:12] So as a believer,
[40:14] we know where WE COME FROM. WE KNOW
[40:16] WHERE WE'RE GOING. BUT THERE'S A LITTLE
[40:19] BIT OF GROUND IN THE MIDDLE THAT IS
[40:20] UNCERTAINTY
[40:24] alpha
[40:26] with the omega.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; But there in the middle there's A LITTLE
[40:30] BIT OF GROUND THAT WE GET A BIT UNSURE.
[40:36] He said I will be with YOU
[40:40] until the end OF THE EARTH.
[40:43] SO IT REQUIRES FAITH
[40:46] IN THE MIDDLE GROUND
[40:48] WHEN there's a lion STAND
[40:53] WHEN EVERYTHING WANTS TO SEE YOU
[40:55] DESTROY.
[40:58] DAVID KNEW NO MATTER HOW MY LIFE GOES
[41:03] ALONE is my destiny.
[41:06] COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU CATCH YOUR
[41:08] PURPOSE?
[41:10] NO MATTER WHAT YOU FACE IN LIFE.
[41:14] WALK THROUGH IT knowing that all things
[41:18] TOGETHER
[41:19] ARE GOOD TO BRING the call of the Lord.
[41:23] YOU'RE NOT JUST HERE DRIFTING THROUGH
[41:26] LIFE
[41:28] FACING RANDOM SITUATIONS
[41:31] YOU FACE IN ORDER OF THE LORD
[41:36] YOU TO YOUR PURPOSE.
[41:40] AMEN. And the only WAY AS A YOUNG PERSON
[41:43] TO SURVIVE IN THE WORLD TODAY
[41:46] HAVE THAT ANOINTING.
[41:49] You might have been BORN IN THE MESSAGE.
[41:52] THE anointing
[41:55] because we are in a day where
[41:57] information is so available.
[42:00] Sin is so available.
[42:05] If I go to the shopping center
[42:08] and I'm walking, there's sin. THERE'S
[42:10] ADVERTISEMENTS
[42:13] of half-dressed women.
[42:17] Walk that way. THERE'S SOMEONE NOT
[42:18] DRESSED. PROBABLY
[42:21] not dressed.
[42:23] I SAY I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE GROUND
[42:25] AND WALK THERE. Look at the ground.
[42:29] Picture on the ground.
[42:32] Amen. Amen. Sin is everywhere you go.
[42:37] WHEN I'M ALONE IN MY BEDROOM,
[42:40] SIN IS AVAILABLE. WHEN I WALK DOWN THE
[42:43] STREET, SIN IS AVAILABLE.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN I KNOW WHO I AM, WHEN I KNOW
[42:49] WHERE I COME FROM, I DON'T NEED TO LOOK
[42:52] AT THE SIN.
[42:54] SIN DOESN'T DEFINE ME.
[42:57] JESUS SACRIFICE AT CALVARY defines me.
[43:04] SO YOUR PHONE, MY YOUNG BROTHER, YOUR
[43:06] PHONE CAN BE USED FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL.
[43:10] THE POWER IS IN YOU.
[43:13] YOU MUST CHOOSE. YOU MUST DECIDE.
[43:17] WHAT ROAD WILL I WALK?
[43:22] AMEN.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And there's David. Am I going slow
[43:24] enough? Am I going slow enough?
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Good. Good. I'm not used to interpreter.
[43:30] So, here's David.
[43:33] He hears about Goliath.
[43:35] HERE'S DAVID ABOUT 16 YEARS OLD. HE'S
[43:39] NOT AN OLD MAN. HE'S A YOUNG MAN. HE'S
[43:43] GOT NO TRAINING.
[43:46] HE'S JUST A SHEPHERD. [laughter]
[43:48] AND HE IS GOLIATH.
[43:50] GOLIATH MAY BE A FOOT OR TWO TALLER THAN
[43:52] HIM.
[43:55] maybe weighs three times WHAT DAVID
[43:57] WEIGHS,
[43:59] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAYS, "I KNOW WHO I AM."
[44:02] AND IT DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THIS
[44:04] PHILISTINE.
[44:06] SOMEBODY MUST TAKE A STAND.
[44:09] GOD IS LOOKING FOR A LEADER THAT CAN SAY
[44:12] WHEN THEY WANT TO WALK AWAY, I WILL FACE
[44:16] GOLIATH
[44:18] BECAUSE HE CAN'T TAKE ME DOWN. THE
[44:21] THRONE IS MY PURPOSE.
[44:23] THE THRONE IS MY DESTINY.
[44:27] IF GOLIATH FALLS ON DAVID, DAVID SAID,
[44:33] "WHAT CHANCE DOES A SHEPHERD HAVE?"
[44:38] BUT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY THAT DAVID
[44:41] TOOK THAT SLING,
[44:43] HE MADE SURE NOT TO AIM
[44:48] BECAUSE HE KNEW IF HE AIMED,
[44:51] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD MISS.
[44:54] SOMETIMES WE TRY SO HARD.
[44:58] GOD SAYS JUST BELIEVE IN YOUR DESTINY.
[45:03] Just believe in your purpose.
[45:07] AND DAVID SAID, "I CAN GO THROUGH ALL
[45:11] THINGS
[45:12] KNOWING THE THRONE IS MY PURPOSE.
[45:16] WHAT can I say? I AM ALIVE
[45:19] AND I KNOW WHY.
[45:22] AMEN.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; FAITH. WHAT DROVE DAVID TO TAKE GOLIATH?
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Faith in his God called position.
[45:36] SO WHEN SATAN COMES AGAINST YOU
[45:39] AND SAYS TRIES TO TEMPT YOU TO GO A
[45:41] certain way,
[45:44] THE ONLY THING THAT WILL HOLD YOU IS
[45:47] FAITH IN YOUR POSITION.
[45:51] YOU MUST KNOW
[45:53] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU COME FROM,
[45:55] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU'RE GOING. AND SATAN CANNOT GET
[45:58] MY SOUL.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; MY SOUL IS ETERNAL.
[46:03] I CAN'T DIE. THE THRONE IS MY DESTINY.
[46:10] It's amazing when you look at David's
[46:12] life.
[46:14] HE WOULD SAY, "Doesn't matter what
[46:16] happens in Ziglag.
[46:19] The throne is my destiny.
[46:22] IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH MY
[46:24] FATHER-IN-LAW.
[46:27] Hope my father-in-law is not watching."
[46:30] He said, "I CAN GO THROUGH ALL THINGS."
[46:36] I suppose I should say
[46:39] just in case it gets back
[46:43] &gt;&gt; I have the best father-in-law.
[46:49] Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; But David,
[46:52] we know the story of Ziglag.
[46:55] This whole day wasn't a complete write
[46:57] off
[46:59] because something bad happened.
[47:02] BUT SO MANY TIMES AS BELIEVERS
[47:05] WHEN WE GET SOME BAD NEWS, OUR WHOLE
[47:08] ENTIRE LIFE FALLS APART.
[47:12] DAVID DIDN'T THROW A TANTRUM. IS THAT A
[47:14] WORD?
[47:17] HE DIDN'T CRY IN THE CORNER.
[47:20] HE DIDN'T SAY, "HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN TO
[47:22] ME? I AM TO BE KING.
[47:26] THIS SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING TO ME."
[47:28] BUT HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. AND THE
[47:32] SCRIPTURE SAYS HE STRENGTHENED HIMSELF
[47:35] IN THE LORD
[47:38] YOU MUST HAVE ENOUGH OF GOD IN YOU
[47:42] THAT WHEN THE BAD NEWS COMES AND YOUR
[47:45] FRIENDS WANT TO STONE YOU. YOU SAY, "OH
[47:49] GOD, THE THRONE [screaming] IS MY
[47:51] PURPOSE.
[47:54] THAT'S WHAT I WANT. I DON'T WANT TO BE
[47:57] DRIFTING THROUGH LIFE,
[47:59] &gt;&gt; DRIFTING THIS WAY,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; DRIFTING THAT WAY, BUT I WANT SOMETHING
[48:04] STEADFAST,
[48:05] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING SURE.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOD DOESN'T LOVE ME,
[48:12] BUT A MATURE CHRISTIAN
[48:15] SAYS, "I WENT THROUGH THIS BECAUSE GOD
[48:18] LOVES ME."
[48:20] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT CHILDREN CAN
[48:23] STAND THE CHASTENING.
[48:29] GOD HAS A PLAN for your life.
[48:32] EVERYTHING YOU GO THROUGH IS TO DRIVE
[48:35] YOU TO YOUR PURPOSE.
[48:38] It's very easy for me to stand here and
[48:41] SAY THAT.
[48:42] BUT WHEN I'M OUT THERE AND SOMETHING
[48:45] HAPPENS I DON'T LIKE,
[48:48] what now?
[48:50] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU STAND IN THAT MOMENT?
[48:53] CAN YOU STAND WHEN YOUR LIFE is falling
[48:55] apart?
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Can you LOOK AT THE GIANT
[49:00] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "THE GIANT IS JUST A A SPEED
[49:03] HUMP ON MY WAY TO MY DESTINY."
[49:07] &gt;&gt; THE GIANT IS A CHARACTER BUILDING SPEED
[49:09] HUMP.
[49:12] YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SLOW DOWN FOR A LITTLE
[49:14] BIT, BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE,
[49:18] JOY COMES IN THE MORNING.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN JUST GO THROUGH THE NIGHT,
[49:23] THE SUN SHALL RISE AGAIN.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; SO NO MATTER IF YOU'RE FACING YOUR
[49:30] FATHER-IN-LAW, [screaming]
[49:32] &gt;&gt; THE AMALACHITES,
[49:34] WHETHER YOU'RE HAVING A ZIGLAG MOMENT,
[49:38] &gt;&gt; THE PATH TO THE THRONE IS A TOUGH PATH.
[49:43] DAVID WAS HUNGRY. HE WANTED THE WATERS
[49:46] of Bethlehem.
[49:49] YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING THROUGH STUFF.
[49:53] THERE'S A PURPOSE TO THE PAIN
[49:58] and it's easy TO SAY THAT NOW.
[50:01] BUT WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE
[50:03] AND THE DOCTOR rings and SAYS THE DOCTOR
[50:06] RINGS AND SAYS there sickness, there's
[50:09] cancer is in your body.
[50:13] You have enough of God IN YOU
[50:16] TO STAND IN THAT MOMENT
[50:19] AND SAY
[50:21] BY HIS STRIPES
[50:23] I AM HEALED.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; LET ANYTHING COME
[50:28] I AM HIDDEN IN THE ROCK.
[50:32] AND WHEN YOU READ THE GOSPELS,
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus would say,
[50:38] &gt;&gt; John was the greatest OF ALL THE
[50:39] PROPHETS.
[50:41] BUT I SAY UNTO YOU, THE LEAST IN THE
[50:45] KINGDOM IS GREATER THAN JOHN.
[50:49] I WANT A REVELATION
[50:51] OF THAT SCRIPTURE.
[50:55] AMEN. And brother Brandon would say,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; he says, "You have more authority than
[51:00] an ARCHANGEL
[51:03] BECAUSE HE SAYS AN ARCHANGEL IS A
[51:05] SERVANT,
[51:07] BUT YOU ARE a son."
[51:13] And he says, "WHEN THE WEAKEST CHRISTIAN
[51:16] GETS DOWN ON THEIR KNEES,
[51:18] YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL LIKE MUCH, BUT WHEN
[51:21] YOU GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES, HELL'S
[51:24] FOUNDATIONS START TO SHAKE."
[51:28] AND YOU CAN PRAY AND SAY, "GOD,
[51:31] THOUGH I'M WALKING A HARD PATH,
[51:34] I KNOW THE THRONE [screaming] IS MY
[51:36] PURPOSE.
[51:39] GOD IS LOOKING FOR A WITNESS
[51:42] THAT CAN STAND IN THE HARD TIMES
[51:45] THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE JUDGMENT,
[51:48] GOD CAN TURN TO YOU AND SAY, "HERE IS MY
[51:51] WITNESS."
[51:53] THAT WHEN IT ALL FELL APART,
[51:56] I HAD ONE
[51:58] WHO STOOD
[52:00] AND STRENGTHENED THEMSELVES IN THE LORD.
[52:03] I WANT TO KNOW WHEN I PRAY,
[52:07] &gt;&gt; HEAVEN IS LISTENING. THAT WHEN I PRAY,
[52:10] HELL'S FOUNDATIONS ARE SHAKING.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; That's the revelation I WANT.
[52:19] AND IF YOU HAVE THAT,
[52:21] &gt;&gt; COME THE GIANT,
[52:23] &gt;&gt; COME WHAT? MAY,
[52:26] I can overcome all things. Amen.
[52:31] So, can I say while you're at camp?
[52:33] While you're at CAMP ON THE MOUNTAIN,
[52:36] GET TO KNOW HIM. GET AN EXPERIENCE WITH
[52:39] GOD
[52:40] BECAUSE IN THE VALLEY YOU NEED TO KNOW
[52:43] HIM.
[52:45] SO CAN I SAY GET TO KNOW HIM ON THE
[52:48] MOUNTAIN SO YOU KNOW HIM IN THE VALLEY
[52:52] THAT NO MATTER WHAT COMES THERE IS A
[52:55] VALLEY COMING
[52:58] WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE DOORS
[53:00] SATAN WILL TEST YOU ON EVERYTHING YOU
[53:03] HEAR HERE. SO CAN I SAY A VALLEY IS
[53:08] COMING, SICKNESS IS COMING,
[53:11] BUT GREATER IS HE
[53:14] THAT IS IN ME THAN ANYTHING THAT IS IN
[53:17] THE WORLD.
[53:19] And if YOU GET THAT REVELATION,
[53:22] YOU CAN WALK THROUGH LIFE VICTORIOUS.
[53:27] THERE'S THAT THAT REVELATION IS MORE
[53:29] IMPORTANT THAN CHURCH.
[53:32] THAT REVELATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
[53:34] YOUR MARRIAGE.
[53:36] BECAUSE WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
[53:38] &gt;&gt; YOUR MARRIAGE WILL LINE UP WITH THE
[53:40] WORD.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL GO TO CHURCH.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; SAY, "PREACHER, BROTHER JOSH,
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I'M DOING MY BEST."
[53:53] AMEN.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; The amazing thing about temptations,
[54:01] temptations are a must FOR A BELIEVER.
[54:05] BECAUSE he who overcomes will inherit.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; SO WITHOUT THE TEMPTATION THERE IS NO
[54:13] OVERCOMING.
[54:15] HUMAN NATURE DOESN'T LIKE THE TRIAL BUT
[54:19] WITHOUT THE TRIAL THERE'S NO OVERCOMING.
[54:23] SO I SAY LORD BE IT UNTO ME. I DON'T
[54:28] LIKE IT BUT BE IT UNTO ME.
[54:32] And the amazing thing for A TEMPTATION,
[54:36] A TEMPTATION HAS TO BE SOMETHING
[54:38] AVAILABLE,
[54:41] A TEMPTATION HAS TO BE SOMETHING YOU
[54:43] WANT.
[54:46] Eating Brussels SPROUTS IS NOT A
[54:48] TEMPTATION. BRUSSELS SPROUTS, you don't
[54:50] have THAT PUMPKIN. EATING PUMPKIN IS NOT
[54:52] A TEMPTATION.
[54:55] SOME VEGETABLES ARE DISGUSTING.
[55:03] Some vegetables are disgusting.
[55:10] It's not It's not a temptation.
[55:18] Eating eating that is not a temptation.
[55:23] But if it's a nice steak dinner,
[55:27] &gt;&gt; it's available.
[55:29] and I want it
[55:31] AND I AND I SHOULDN'T be eating it. IT'S
[55:35] NOW A TEMPTATION.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN SEE WHATEVER that sin is in
[55:40] your life,
[55:42] THAT TEMPTATION IN YOUR LIFE
[55:45] THAT YOU WANT
[55:47] THAT IS AVAILABLE.
[55:49] THAT IS THE THING YOU MUST OVERCOME.
[55:56] AMEN. BUT TO HIM THAT OVERCOMEMETH
[56:00] WILL INHERIT ALL THINGS. THE SCRIPTURE
[56:02] SAYS
[56:04] AND BROTHER WOULD SAY ALL THINGS IS THE
[56:08] BRIDE.
[56:10] WHAT ARE YOU INHERITING
[56:12] THE REVELATION OF WHO YOU ARE?
[56:17] Just overcome.
[56:19] IT'S EASY TO SAY NOW.
[56:22] WHEN YOU WALK OUT THERE
[56:24] &gt;&gt; and it's available,
[56:27] there's when the trial starts.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you what a Brussels
[56:33] sprout is.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; You know what a cabbage is?
[56:40] It's about this big, but looks like a
[56:42] cabbage.
[56:45] I don't know who invented it.
[56:48] It's not good.
[56:51] And some people like it.
[56:54] We pray for those people.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; I'm getting too comfortable.
[57:10] But the amazing thing is the new birth
[57:13] brings the ability to overcome.
[57:20] As I said yesterday, before the new
[57:22] birth, I did whatever I wanted to do.
[57:27] But now with the new birth, it comes
[57:30] with a desire to stand.
[57:33] AND the scripture says in Proverbs 24,
[57:37] it says, "The righteous man
[57:40] falls seven times.
[57:44] We are the generation
[57:46] OF THE RIGHTEOUS.
[57:48] BUT IT SAYS, AND I'M PARAPHRASING, BUT
[57:50] IT SAYS THE UNRIGHTEOUS MAN
[57:53] FALLS INTO MISCHIEF.
[57:56] HE STAYS THERE. But the RIGHTEOUS MAN,
[58:00] HE FALLS SEVEN TIMES BECAUSE HE GETS
[58:03] BACK UP AGAIN.
[58:07] WHAT IS AN OVERCOMER?
[58:10] IT IS SOMEONE WHO GETS UP AGAIN WHEN YOU
[58:13] DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING UP AGAIN.
[58:16] THERE'S A CONVICTION IN THE HEART
[58:19] THAT SAYS, "I MUST GET BACK UP AGAIN."
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] COME ON, DAVID.
[58:30] GET BACK up again.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But as parents,
[58:37] and I'm sure there's a lot of young
[58:39] people here,
[58:41] we try WE TRY TO SHELTER OUR CHILDREN
[58:45] to such a point
[58:48] that it makes life harder for the child.
[58:52] We try to wrap the child in cotton wool.
[58:56] We try TO PUT THEM IN A LITTLE HOUSE AND
[58:59] leave them there.
[59:02] BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS
[59:04] THEY REACH THE AGE WHERE THEY GO AND
[59:06] WORK.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; THEY REACH THE AGE WHERE THEY GO TO
[59:10] UNIVERSITY.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; AND SUDDENLY THERE'S A WHOLE ARRAY OF
[59:14] TEMPTATIONS.
[59:18] THEY'RE NOT BUILT UP TO FACE THE
[59:19] TEMPTATION.
[59:21] SUDDENLY SIN IS ENTICING.
[59:26] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY SIN IS
[59:29] BEAUTIFUL.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; And if you SAY IT'S NOT,
[59:33] WILL CAST THAT LYING SPIRIT out of you.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] So, I come to find out in my own
[59:44] childhood,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; I grew up in the message, those who
[59:49] weren't here yesterday,
[59:51] &gt;&gt; THAT GETTING YOUR CHILD TO conform to
[59:55] the dos and don'ts of the MESSAGE
[1:00:01] will not protect them from sin.
[1:00:06] I HAVE THREE CHILDREN.
[1:00:09] AS A PARENT, I would do whatever I COULD
[1:00:13] TO PROT PROTECT MY CHILD FROM SIN.
[1:00:18] I WISH I COULD PROTECT THEM FROM THE
[1:00:19] SINFUL DESIRES OF THE WORLD,
[1:00:24] but I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE
[1:00:26] THE DESIRE OF THE CHILD,
[1:00:30] but I have A SECRET WEAPON
[1:00:33] THAT WHEN MY CHILD IS GOING ASTRAY,
[1:00:38] I CAN PRAY.
[1:00:40] AND BROTHER RANDOM WOULD SAY, "IF YOU
[1:00:42] WANT YOUR LOVED ONES SAVED,
[1:00:45] PRAY.
[1:00:47] SOMETIMES WE LOOK FOR SOMETHING SO DEEP
[1:00:50] AND FAR OFF,
[1:00:52] BUT HE SAYS, "PRAY for them."
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Adding our own interpretation TO THE
[1:00:58] MESSAGE
[1:01:00] WILL not protect our children from sin.
[1:01:05] Growing up in the message,
[1:01:08] I thought, "WE'RE IN THE MESSAGE.
[1:01:10] THERE'S NO TEMPTATION."
[1:01:14] But then I went out into the world.
[1:01:17] I never left church GOING CHURCH
[1:01:20] BUT I WENT AND GOT A JOB.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I WENT AND became a a I went to work
[1:01:28] suddenly all the temptations are there
[1:01:32] and there come a time back home
[1:01:36] in the church there where I grew up
[1:01:39] there was about 30 or 40 young people
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; friends of mine
[1:01:46] pastor's children, deacon's children, uh
[1:01:49] the preachers children.
[1:01:52] ONE BY ONE, SATAN COME in
[1:01:55] started to pull each one of them out.
[1:01:59] And I WAS SITTING THERE WATCHING THIS
[1:02:02] and I SAID, "LORD, WHAT'S GOING ON
[1:02:04] HERE?"
[1:02:06] AND I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM REAL WELL
[1:02:08] because I grew up in the message.
[1:02:12] I thought I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM
[1:02:14] BECAUSE I WENT TO FOUR SERVICES A WEEK.
[1:02:19] I WENT TO ALL THE CAMPS.
[1:02:23] I WENT TO PRAYER MEETING WHEN THE OTHERS
[1:02:25] WOULDN'T GO.
[1:02:29] I thought I WAS REAL SPIRITUAL. I'M IN
[1:02:32] THE MESSAGE.
[1:02:34] BUT WHEN MY FRIENDS STARTED TO WALK
[1:02:36] AWAY,
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; there's a PULL ON ME THAT SAID, "WHY
[1:02:40] DON'T YOU ALSO GO?"
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And I was sitting I WAS SITTING IN
[1:02:46] CHURCH. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I WAS
[1:02:48] SITTING.
[1:02:51] And I was praying. I SAID, "LORD, THIS
[1:02:53] WAS MY LAST SERVICE.
[1:02:56] I'M DONE. I'M WALKING AWAY.
[1:02:59] I CAN'T LIVE THE LIE.
[1:03:02] I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I HAD SOMETHING. BUT THEN I
[1:03:07] REALIZED
[1:03:09] I DIDN'T HAVE WHAT I THOUGHT I HAD.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL PULL EVERY BRICK AWAY FROM YOUR
[1:03:16] LIFE
[1:03:19] SO THAT YOUR EYES COME OFF EVERYTHING,
[1:03:21] YOUR FRIENDS,
[1:03:23] AND YOUR EYES GO ONTO HIM.
[1:03:26] AND I WAS JUST SITTING THERE. AND AS I
[1:03:28] WAS SITTING THERE, I SAID, "LORD, I'M
[1:03:31] DONE."
[1:03:34] 100% IN MY HEART. NO DESIRE TO BE A
[1:03:37] CHRISTIAN.
[1:03:40] NOTHING THERE.
[1:03:42] THERE'S NOTHING I COULD RELY ON.
[1:03:46] AND that was it. End of the meeting.
[1:03:48] Within 2 minutes I was going
[1:03:52] and the Lord spoke to me
[1:03:55] AND HE SAID, "DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU
[1:03:57] GO.
[1:03:59] DOESN'T MATTER WHATEVER YOU DO
[1:04:02] AS A TRUE SON OF GOD, YOU'RE ALWAYS
[1:04:05] COMING BACK HOME."
[1:04:09] CAN I SAY I WAS THAT PRODICAL SON?
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; I WAS ON THE WAY OUT THE DOOR.
[1:04:15] THAN GOD RICH [screaming] IN MERCY.
[1:04:18] HE CAME BY MY WAY.
[1:04:22] I HAD NO DESIRE FOR HIM.
[1:04:25] BUT HE CAME.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; HE TOUCHED THE SEED INSIDE OF ME.
[1:04:31] HE WATERED THE SEED.
[1:04:34] AND NOW WHAT YOU SEE IS BECAUSE THE
[1:04:37] GRACE OF GOD.
[1:04:42] AMEN. I MAY NOT HAVE SOME GREAT
[1:04:44] TESTIMONY
[1:04:46] WHERE GOD DRAGGED ME OUT OF THE WORLD,
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE A TESTIMONY
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; OF THE KEEPING POWER of almighty GOD
[1:04:58] THAT WHEN I HAD NO DESIRE.
[1:05:02] He said, I SEE YOU THERE,
[1:05:05] YOU MIGHT COME HERE TO THIS CAMP WITH NO
[1:05:08] DESIRE FOR HIM.
[1:05:10] YOU MAY BE ON THE VERGE OF WALKING AWAY,
[1:05:14] BUT GOD SEES YOUR CRY. SO NO MATTER
[1:05:17] WHERE YOU GO AS A SON OF GOD, AS A
[1:05:21] DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU'RE ALWAYS COMING
[1:05:24] BACK HOME.
[1:05:27] THERE'S A SEED INSIDE OF YOU THAT WILL
[1:05:30] HAUNT YOU ALL YOUR LIFE
[1:05:33] TILL YOU COME BACK TO YOUR POSITION.
[1:05:39] AMEN.
[1:05:40] I MAY NOT HAVE SOME GREAT TESTIMONY OF
[1:05:43] DELIVERANCE,
[1:05:44] BUT GOD SAVED MY SOUL.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; From that moment,
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; did all my problems disappear?
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, they got worse.
[1:06:01] Why? God was challenging
[1:06:05] my confession
[1:06:08] AND GOD WILL CHALLENGE YOUR CONFESSION.
[1:06:13] And I thought, I'm in THE MESSAGE. I
[1:06:14] SHOULDN'T HAVE THESE TEMPTATIONS.
[1:06:17] SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME. SOMETHING'S
[1:06:19] WRONG WITH MY UH MY MY MY CALLING.
[1:06:23] SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY EXPERIENCE.
[1:06:26] WHY AM I BEING TEMPTED?
[1:06:28] BUT I COME TO FIND OUT.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT ARE CALLED OF GOD
[1:06:33] ARE TEMPTED. THEY'RE TRIED.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN STAND IN THE DARKEST OF
[1:06:38] TIMES.
[1:06:41] THE TRIALS DON'T GET EASIER. THEY GET
[1:06:45] HARDER. THEY GET HARDER. BUT YOU'RE
[1:06:48] STANDING AS A WITNESS.
[1:06:51] GOD HAS A PERSON THAT CAN STAND IN THE
[1:06:55] HARDEST OF TIMES.
[1:07:00] AMEN.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Receiving the Holy Ghost is just the
[1:07:06] start,
[1:07:09] let us go onto perfection.
[1:07:14] And if the scripture says, "Be ye
[1:07:16] therefore perfect,"
[1:07:18] THE SCRIPTURE, GOD MUST MAKE A way
[1:07:23] for you TO FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE.
[1:07:27] HE DOESN'T JUST PUT THE SCRIPTURE OUT IN
[1:07:29] THE AIR AND SAY GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; BUT WITH THE SCRIPTURE, HE PROVIDES A
[1:07:37] WAY FOR YOU TO COME INTO YOUR POSITION.
[1:07:42] I SEE A GLORIOUS CHURCH AND HE MAKES A
[1:07:45] WAY FOR YOU TO BECOME THE GLORIOUS
[1:07:49] CHURCH.
[1:07:52] God comes to your level.
[1:07:57] AMEN.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Are we happy?
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; We got to be happy.
[1:08:05] [cheering]
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; In Romans chapter 7,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; this is Paul writing.
[1:08:13] Paul the Apostle.
[1:08:16] Paul had the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:19] Paul had more revelation than any other
[1:08:21] man THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE.
[1:08:24] SO IN ROMANS chapter 7 he starts writing
[1:08:29] and let me paraphrase the first few
[1:08:31] verses to save time
[1:08:35] but go and read it when you get a
[1:08:37] chance.
[1:08:39] He says in me is two persons.
[1:08:43] He says the inward wants to do right
[1:08:46] but the outward wants to do wrong.
[1:08:49] EVERY TIME I START TO DO RIGHT,
[1:08:53] wrong is there.
[1:08:55] EVIL IS PRESENT.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And brother Random would say the outside
[1:09:01] IS CONTROLLED BY FIVE SENSES,
[1:09:05] but there's another sense of faith.
[1:09:09] SO WHEN THE FIVE SENSES ON THE outside
[1:09:13] are leading you into wrong,
[1:09:16] WE MUST RELY ON THE SENSE IN THE INSIDE.
[1:09:21] WE MUST STAY WITH FAITH. WE MUST STAY
[1:09:24] WITH OUR POSITION.
[1:09:27] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM would say, HE SAYS,
[1:09:29] "HOW?" SOMEONE ASKED HIM THE QUESTION,
[1:09:32] "HOW DO I KNOW IF MY THOUGHT IS GOOD, IF
[1:09:34] IT'S FROM SATAN OR THE OR GOD?
[1:09:39] AND HE SAYS, "IF IT IS GOOD, IT IS FROM
[1:09:41] GOD.
[1:09:44] IF IT IS BAD, IT IS FROM SATAN."
[1:09:48] HOW MANY TIMES WE COMPLICATE THINGS?
[1:09:51] THAT THOUGHT THAT'S PLAGUING YOUR MIND.
[1:09:55] IF IT'S GOOD, IT'S FROM GOD. IF IT'S
[1:09:57] BAD, IT'S FROM SATAN.
[1:10:01] And I said this last Wednesday, but let
[1:10:02] me say it again.
[1:10:04] I woke up the other day and Satan put
[1:10:08] this temptation into my mind
[1:10:11] and the most amazing thing happened.
[1:10:15] I just laughed.
[1:10:17] I just laughed.
[1:10:20] I said, "Satan,
[1:10:22] why bother?"
[1:10:25] What a moment.
[1:10:29] Amen. What a moment.
[1:10:34] So when the word says something
[1:10:37] and the five senses say it's not true,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; the five senses
[1:10:44] say it's not true. Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; And faith says that's nothing but the
[1:10:49] truth.
[1:10:51] Take what faith said.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; So in Romans 7:1 17
[1:11:01] Paul's writing
[1:11:03] Paul the great apostle.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; If you turn in your Bible to the Old
[1:11:08] Testament, you
[1:11:11] keep going.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Romans 7.
[1:11:22] Romans 7:1 17 he says,
[1:11:27] "Now then it is no more that I do it.
[1:11:32] but sin that dwelleth in me.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; It's not me that does it.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; It's a sin that dwelleth in me. This is
[1:11:47] Paul writing.
[1:11:49] This is Paul the Apostle.
[1:11:52] HE'S SAYING, "WHEN I want to do right,
[1:11:54] there's something with me that wants to
[1:11:56] do wrong."
[1:11:58] AND HE'S SAYING, "I HAVE TO OVERCOME
[1:12:00] THIS.
[1:12:02] I DON'T I DON'T GIVE IN TO THE SIN.
[1:12:06] I don't JUST SAY, "WELL, THERE'S SIN
[1:12:08] HERE. I WILL FOLLOW IT."
[1:12:10] BUT HE'S SAYING, "I MUST OVERCOME."
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH TEMPTATION.
[1:12:19] IT'S THERE. IT'S PRESENT.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; BUT IT IS NO MORE I THAT AM TEMPTED.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE FLESH THAT IS TEMPTED.
[1:12:32] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; AS BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY,
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE REAL ME.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST A JACKET THAT I PUT ON
[1:12:43] ONE OF THESE DAYS. THIS JACKET IS GOING
[1:12:46] TO GIVE WAY AND I'M GOING TO TAKE MY
[1:12:49] FLIGHT TO A HEAVENLY HOME. BUT WHILE I'M
[1:12:53] HERE, LET ME FIGHT. LET ME OVERCOME. LET
[1:12:58] ME NEVER BOW TO SIN.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Verse 19.
[1:13:07] FOR THE GOOD THAT I would do not,
[1:13:10] but the evil which I would not
[1:13:15] that I do.
[1:13:18] Sometimes we get stuck in the old
[1:13:19] English. So, let me put it like this.
[1:13:24] I want TO DO GOOD,
[1:13:27] BUT I JUST AIN'T doing it.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want TO DO BAD,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; BUT I'm doing it.
[1:13:42] That's what it says.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; But is no more I that do it.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; The scripture has to come with a
[1:13:51] revelation.
[1:13:54] He says, "I find then a law." Verse 21,
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; verse 21, "I find then a law
[1:14:04] that when I would do good,
[1:14:06] evil is present with me.
[1:14:10] For I delight." How do I know I'm born
[1:14:12] again?
[1:14:14] For I delight in the law of of God after
[1:14:20] the inward member, after the inward man.
[1:14:26] But I see another law in my members,
[1:14:30] waring against the law of my mind and
[1:14:34] bringing me into captivity
[1:14:36] to the law of sin which is IN MY
[1:14:39] MEMBERS.
[1:14:41] OH WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM
[1:14:44] who shall DELIVER ME FROM THIS BODY OF
[1:14:48] DEATH. BUT I [screaming] THANK GOD
[1:14:51] THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.
[1:14:55] SO THEN WITH THE MIND
[1:14:58] I MYSELF SERVE THE LAW OF GOD,
[1:15:02] BUT WITH the flesh,
[1:15:04] the law of sin,
[1:15:08] you become a walking, talking civil war.
[1:15:17] THERE'S TWO YOU'S IN HERE AND YOU'RE
[1:15:21] FIGHTING.
[1:15:24] Remember
[1:15:26] remember the old chief that come to
[1:15:27] brother Brandham
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; and he said there's two there's two dogs
[1:15:32] fighting in here.
[1:15:35] Brother Brandham said what ONE IS
[1:15:36] WINNING? HE SAID IT IS THE one that I
[1:15:39] feed the most.
[1:15:42] SO I WONDER WHO ARE YOU FEEDING THE MOST
[1:15:45] MY YOUNG BROTHER? WHO ARE YOU FEEDING
[1:15:47] THE MOST MY YOUNG SISTER? WHEN YOU FEEL
[1:15:49] LIKE GOING A CERTAIN WAY WHO ARE YOU
[1:15:52] FEEDING?
[1:15:54] LET US FEED THE SPIRIT SO THE SPIRIT CAN
[1:15:57] TAKE THE INSIDE UNDER SUBJECTION TO THE
[1:16:00] LAW OF GOD.
[1:16:06] And then and then Paul Paul would get to
[1:16:09] Romans chapter 8 verse one.
[1:16:14] I bet when Paul read this scripture he
[1:16:16] had a little moment.
[1:16:20] There is therefore NOW
[1:16:24] NO condemnation
[1:16:26] to them WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS WHO
[1:16:29] WALK NOT AFTER THE FLESH
[1:16:32] BUT AFTER the spirit.
[1:16:37] What a moment THAT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR
[1:16:39] PAUL.
[1:16:42] HE SAYS THERE'S CONVICTION IN THE
[1:16:44] BELIEVER, BUT THERE'S NO CONDEMNATION.
[1:16:50] THAT WHEN YOU SAY, "LORD GOD, FORGIVE
[1:16:52] ME."
[1:16:54] AS I said yesterday, AND I'LL SAY IT
[1:16:56] AGAIN,
[1:16:58] NOT SOME DRY EYED CONFESSION.
[1:17:02] I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR HEART.
[1:17:05] WILL YOU SAY, "OH GOD,
[1:17:07] FORGIVE ME FOR THE WAY I WENT.
[1:17:10] FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I DID.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; I CLAIM THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:17:16] I CLAIM HIS MERCY.
[1:17:19] I CLAIM HIS GRACE.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; LET ME GO ON MY WAY. OH GOD.
[1:17:27] And from that time,
[1:17:30] leave it there. AND IF YOU GO BACK AGAIN
[1:17:34] AND SAY, "LORD, I prayed this yesterday,
[1:17:36] but let ME PRAY IT AGAIN.
[1:17:39] FORGIVE ME for what I DID YESTERDAY.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL LOOK AT YOU
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; AND HE WILL SAY I DON'T KNOW
[1:17:48] WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T HEAR YOUR VOICE.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; HE SEES THE BLOOD.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU'RE FALLEN OVER,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; GET BACK UP AGAIN.
[1:18:08] THERE IS THEREFORE NOW
[1:18:10] NO CONDEMNATION.
[1:18:13] CONDEMNATION IS WHEN SATAN COMES AND HE
[1:18:16] SAYS, "YOU'RE LAST. YOU'VE SINNED YOUR
[1:18:19] DAY OF GRACE AWAY. YOU'VE GOT NO HOPE.
[1:18:23] BUT THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO
[1:18:26] CONDEMNATION.
[1:18:28] TO THEM WHO WALK AFTER THE SPIRIT,
[1:18:31] YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN.
[1:18:35] WALK AFTER THE SPIRIT AND LET THE SPIRIT
[1:18:40] GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH.
[1:18:43] WE'RE ON A JOURNEY.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T START THIS JOURNEY WITH
[1:18:48] PERFECTION.
[1:18:50] YOU END THE JOURNEY. WITH PERFECTION.
[1:18:55] HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:57] AMEN.
[1:19:08] AMEN. [applause]
[1:19:10] AMEN.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; SO, if you've been in the message for
[1:19:12] 400 years
[1:19:16] and the same thing is still getting you,
[1:19:20] something is wrong somewhere.
[1:19:24] I'm talking about a believer
[1:19:28] on a journey.
[1:19:31] 400 YEARS TIME
[1:19:33] YOU SHOULD START OVERCOMING.
[1:19:37] YOU MIGHT FALL SEVEN TIMES,
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE ON A JOURNEY.
[1:19:43] AFTER A WHILE,
[1:19:45] SATAN DOESN'T get you THE FIRST TIME, HE
[1:19:48] GETS YOU THE SECOND TIME, BUT THEN THE
[1:19:50] NEXT TIME HE DOESN'T GET YOU AT ALL.
[1:19:53] WE'RE ON A JOURNEY UNTO PERFECTION.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET SATAN CONDEMN YOU FOR
[1:20:04] SOMETHING UNDER THE BLOOD.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A THERE'S A SIGN ON THE SEA OF
[1:20:10] GOD'S FORGETFULNESS.
[1:20:13] IT SAYS NO FISHING.
[1:20:17] Leave it under the blood.
[1:20:20] DON'T DRAG IT BACK OUT
[1:20:23] AND SAY, "GOD, I REQUIRE FORGIVENESS
[1:20:25] AGAIN.
[1:20:28] LEAVE IT UNDER [screaming] THE BLOOD.
[1:20:31] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Revelation points to this verse.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; I know who I am.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; And if Satan can get you looking at the
[1:20:46] sin, the mistake, the temptation, THE
[1:20:50] TRIAL, YOUR EYE IS NOT ON THE THRONE.
[1:20:55] DAVID HAD TO KEEP HIS EYE ON THE THRONE.
[1:20:59] THAT REGARDLESS WHAT HE WENT THROUGH,
[1:21:02] THE THRONE IS my purpose.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon was so
[1:21:08] excited.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; What a day it was
[1:21:14] when I discovered I WAS NOT THE SON of
[1:21:17] Charles and Ella Brham.
[1:21:21] I COME FROM A HOME
[1:21:24] BEYOND THE SEA.
[1:21:26] I'M SO THANKFUL THAT THE ALCOHOL
[1:21:29] PROBLEMS IN MY FAMILY,
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT MY DNA.
[1:21:33] I COME FROM across the river.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Do I have 10 minutes?
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; In 10 minutes. All right, let's do this.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Can I put it like this?
[1:21:51] The spirit you
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; repents for what the flesh you did.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; You are a walking, talking civil war.
[1:22:08] We're on a journey.
[1:22:10] We must overcome.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Knowing there is grace
[1:22:17] doesn't mean you don't need to overcome.
[1:22:20] BUT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY,
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO THROUGH LIFE GOING GRACE,
[1:22:24] GRACE, GRACE, YOU TURN grace into a
[1:22:28] disgrace.
[1:22:30] We never want to TURN GRACE INTO A
[1:22:32] DISGRACE.
[1:22:34] BUT WE WANT TO SAY, LORD, GIVE ME
[1:22:37] STRENGTH TO OVERCOME.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; And then brother Brandon would say,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT HE'S DONE, THE BLOOD
[1:22:50] COVERS HIM
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT."
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "YOU ARE PERFECTLY
[1:23:00] ABSOLUTELY
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN SINLESS BEFORE GOD.
[1:23:08] YOU CANNOT GET ANY MORE OF A COVERING
[1:23:11] THAN PERFECTLY, ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S NO
[1:23:14] CHANCE.
[1:23:16] THE BLOOD HAS COVERED YOU.
[1:23:22] AMEN. AND THEN PAUL PAUL WOULD WRITE
[1:23:25] Paul writes and he says where sin
[1:23:26] abounds
[1:23:29] grace much more abound.
[1:23:34] But I don't want to walk through life
[1:23:36] saying grace grace grace.
[1:23:39] Let me come into my POSITION
[1:23:43] AND SAY THANK YOU LORD FOR GRACE
[1:23:46] BUT LET ME MOVE ON WITH AUTHORITY TO THE
[1:23:48] THRONE.
[1:23:51] I DON'T WANT TO WALK I DON'T WANT TO
[1:23:53] WALK THROUGH LIFE
[1:23:55] TRIPPING UP OVER SIN BEHIND ME.
[1:24:00] IT IS BEHIND ME.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; I'M moving forward.
[1:24:06] Amen.
[1:24:08] Don't trip over condemnation.
[1:24:14] Let me read this. Brother Brandon would
[1:24:17] say in the church age book,
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; he says, "The heavenly bridegroom
[1:24:21] created his own bride."
[1:24:26] That's amazing.
[1:24:29] IF I COULD CREATE my own bride.
[1:24:33] Yes, brothers.
[1:24:35] Come on. WHAT WOULD WE DO?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; SHE WOULD COOK REAL WELL.
[1:24:42] SHE WOULD BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
[1:24:45] sister the WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.
[1:24:48] Her family would have a lot of money.
[1:24:53] I want some sort of inheritance here
[1:24:58] and she would have a great character.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Of course, I would create my wife. Now,
[1:25:08] in case she's watching,
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; every brother says, "Yeah, that's
[1:25:15] right."
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Every married brother would create their
[1:25:18] wife just LIKE SHE IS. WE WOULDN'T
[1:25:22] CHANGE A THING.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; I don't know if she's watching.
[1:25:35] Oh my sisters, if you could create your
[1:25:37] own husband,
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I wonder what he would be like.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, he would be handsome. HE'D BE RICH.
[1:25:47] HE'D BE good-look
[1:25:49] and a great character,
[1:25:52] a great Christian.
[1:25:55] So, brother Brandon would say, "God
[1:25:58] created his own wife
[1:26:01] and he created you
[1:26:04] with your issues,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; the trials,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; the temptations.
[1:26:12] God with a great created ability.
[1:26:17] God who could have made you in any WAY
[1:26:19] HE WANTED.
[1:26:21] HE COULD HAVE PLACED A GREAT OVERCOMING
[1:26:24] ABILITY IN YOU.
[1:26:26] OR HE COULD HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE THAT
[1:26:28] SIN HAD NEVER TEMPTED YOU.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; HE COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU THE CHARACTER OF
[1:26:33] THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAYS, "I IN MY WISDOM
[1:26:39] HAVE CREATED YOU
[1:26:41] IN YOUR SHORTCOMINGS
[1:26:44] WITH YOUR WAYS WHERE YOU GO ASTRAY
[1:26:46] SOMETIMES."
[1:26:48] AND HE SAYS, "I HAVE CREATED YOU."
[1:26:52] SO MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING AT OURSELF A
[1:26:54] LITTLE BIT WRONG.
[1:26:56] WHEN GOD CREATED YOU,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; GOD CREATED THE BEST.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; He could have MADE YOU ANY WAY HE CHOSE,
[1:27:06] BUT HE MADE YOU LOOK LIKE YOU LOOK.
[1:27:10] HE MADE YOU WITH THE DESIRES THAT YOU
[1:27:12] HAVE.
[1:27:14] HE PLACED YOU WHERE YOU ARE.
[1:27:18] BUT THROUGH HIS WORK,
[1:27:21] HE SAYS, "I'M TAKING A CHARACTERFILLED
[1:27:23] BRIDE.
[1:27:25] I'M TAKING THE GLORY."
[1:27:29] HE NEVER JUST POPPED YOU THROUGH A PIPE
[1:27:32] AND SAID, "BLESSED IS HE WHO OVERCOMES."
[1:27:36] BROTHER BRHAM WOULD BROTHER BRHAM WOULD
[1:27:38] SAY, "YOU NEVER OVERCOME NOTHING,
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WHO OVERCOMES
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; WILL I GRANT TO SIT WITH ME.
[1:27:48] IN MY [screaming] THRONE.
[1:27:50] I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BRIDE. I'M TALKING
[1:27:53] ABOUT YOUR POSITION
[1:27:55] IN THE THRONE.
[1:27:58] SO MAYBE YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOURSELF
[1:28:00] WRONG.
[1:28:02] WHEN GOD CREATED YOU,
[1:28:05] HE CREATED THE BEST.
[1:28:10] NEVER LET SATAN TELL YOU
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SECOND BEST.
[1:28:16] NEVER LET SATAN TELL YOU YOU'RE LOST.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS PREDESTINATED YOU
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; INTO A POSITION
[1:28:24] INTO A POSITION THAT YOU CAN RULE and
[1:28:28] reign with him.
[1:28:31] Amen. But God looks at YOU
[1:28:35] AND HE SITS back and says,
[1:28:38] "I made my own bride."
[1:28:44] Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we think our opinions
[1:28:47] are so good.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; I think God
[1:28:54] would have done it a little bit
[1:28:55] different. You know,
[1:28:59] but God says
[1:29:01] my ways are higher than your ways.
[1:29:08] Stop looking at ourself THE WAY WE ARE
[1:29:12] AND LOOK AT our look at ourself
[1:29:15] the way he looks at you.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And if you can LOOK AT YOU THE WAY HE
[1:29:21] LOOKS AT YOU,
[1:29:23] WHAT IS THE TEMPTATION THEN? WHAT IS THE
[1:29:26] TRIAL? THEN
[1:29:28] you need a revelation of who you are.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; I no longer CALL YOU CHURCH. I CALL YOU
[1:29:37] BRIDE.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; AND WITH THE TRIAL, THE TEMPTATION,
[1:29:43] HE PROVIDES A WAY OUT. THE SCRIPTURE
[1:29:46] SAYS HE WILL NOT TEST YOU. HE WILL NOT
[1:29:49] TRY YOU ABOVE WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO
[1:29:52] STAND.
[1:29:54] BUT WITH THE TRIAL,
[1:29:56] HE MAKES A WAY OF ESCAPE.
[1:30:00] We thank the Lord.
[1:30:05] You must have a little bit of bad in YOU
[1:30:11] to be a good person.
[1:30:17] Why?
[1:30:20] Why?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; God has angels
[1:30:24] and their righteousness before him is as
[1:30:26] filthy rags.
[1:30:30] But you must have bad in you to be a
[1:30:33] good person.
[1:30:36] If you had no bad,
[1:30:39] you'd be an angel.
[1:30:42] God already HAS ANGELS.
[1:30:45] HE WANTS YOU.
[1:30:50] HE WANTS YOU WITH YOUR ISSUES.
[1:30:53] YOU WITH YOUR TRIALS.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; YOU WITH THAT SIN THAT SO EASILY BESETS
[1:30:58] YOU.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU WITH YOUR BAD.
[1:31:03] THAT DESIRE THAT WANTS TO GO INTO THE
[1:31:05] WORLD. GOD WANTS YOU.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; SO LET THE GOOD OVERCOME THE BAD.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE BECOMING THE ANSWER TO THE
[1:31:19] DEVIL'S QUESTION.
[1:31:22] WHEN HE SAYS,
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; "NOBODY CAN STAND IN SATAN'S EDEN."
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS, "HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JOB?"
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; AND THERE STEPS FORWARD A BROTHER. THERE
[1:31:35] STEPS FORWARD A SISTER.
[1:31:37] SAY, "OH GOD,
[1:31:40] ME WITH MY BAD. I'M STANDING IN SATAN'S
[1:31:43] EU.
[1:31:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Let me close somewhere.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say in questions
[1:31:56] and answers.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "And as long as you're in this
[1:32:00] life, you're going to be sticky sticky
[1:32:05] and have A CARNAL NATURE THAT'S GOING TO
[1:32:08] bother you as long as you're going to
[1:32:12] live.
[1:32:15] But in the inside of you,
[1:32:18] HE SAYS YOU ARE BORN AGAIN.
[1:32:21] And when you are raised up, you're in
[1:32:24] THE LIKENESS OF CHRIST
[1:32:26] AND ALL THE SIN HAS GONE FROM YOU.
[1:32:31] So who are you?
[1:32:36] So overcoming is not a gift,
[1:32:39] it's a victory.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; STOP JUDGING YOURSELF.
[1:32:46] STOP JUDGING YOUR eternal destination
[1:32:50] on your report card.
[1:32:54] I prayed three times. I didn't look at
[1:32:57] that thing. I'm going heaven today.
[1:33:01] Tomorrow I'm not going heaven no more.
[1:33:06] Has anyone ever been there?
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I feel unsaved.
[1:33:13] Sometimes I feel saved.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; DON'T ASK me what's going on. Ask me
[1:33:20] what the word says.
[1:33:24] [cheering] Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Let me introduce grace.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Goodness, it's hard to close.
[1:33:34] Nothing gives prevailing power
[1:33:37] over the devil like revelation.
[1:33:43] So don't fall off a mountain because of
[1:33:45] something.
[1:33:48] Get back on the mountain.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; So when God created you, he created THE
[1:33:55] BEST.
[1:33:56] AND IT defies human logic.
[1:34:00] Defies human logic.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; But let me close with this. You know,
[1:34:09] I'm just battling the wind here.
[1:34:13] Maybe the tablet's the way to go.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:16] But when Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; these are three people, they didn't have
[1:34:22] the Holy Ghost,
[1:34:24] but they had something that they stood
[1:34:27] in Babylon
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; that when there was a temptation that
[1:34:32] came
[1:34:34] and Nebuchadnezzar said, when you hear
[1:34:38] the music playing, the trumpet, the
[1:34:41] drums, the guitar, the piano, HE SAID, I
[1:34:44] WANT YOU TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIPED A
[1:34:46] STATUE.
[1:34:49] SO OFF WENT THE MUSIC.
[1:34:51] SHADRACH, MESHACH, and Abedneo SAID, "NO
[1:34:54] CHANCE WILL I BOW TO THE WORLD."
[1:34:58] AND SO they dragged before an angry
[1:35:00] king.
[1:35:01] AND NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAYS, "I AM A KING OF
[1:35:04] MERCY.
[1:35:06] I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE.
[1:35:08] LET THE MUSIC GO."
[1:35:11] AND SHADRACH SAID,
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; "JUST A MINUTE, KING.
[1:35:16] LET'S NOT WASTE OUR TIME.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHO [screaming] I AM.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; DON'T BOTHER GIVING ME A TEMPTATION.
[1:35:24] I'M GOING TO STAND."
[1:35:27] THEY LOOKED STRAIGHT IN THE FACE OF THIS
[1:35:29] KING. HE WAS AN ANGRY KING.
[1:35:34] HE WAS A MAD MAN.
[1:35:36] AND THEY SAID, "NO.
[1:35:41] NO,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; WE WILL NOT BOW.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; WE WILL NOT BEND AND WE WILL NOT BURN.
[1:35:56] And Nebuchadnezzar said,
[1:35:59] "WHO IS THAT GOD [screaming]
[1:36:01] THAT SHALL DELIVER YOU OUT OF MY HANDS?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; I know a God.
[1:36:10] Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And I like their answer. They said, "We
[1:36:14] are not careful to answer you in this
[1:36:17] matter.
[1:36:21] I don't care if I offend you.
[1:36:24] I'm staying with the word.
[1:36:28] Your friends will drag YOU ONE WAY.
[1:36:32] I WILL NOT GO.
[1:36:34] I WILL NOT BOW.
[1:36:37] YOU MUST BE DETERMINED.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW YOUR POSITION.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW THAT IF THIS EARTHLY
[1:36:44] TABERNACLE
[1:36:46] BE DISSOLVED,
[1:36:48] I'VE GOT ONE ALREADY WAITING.
[1:36:52] They say, "If not,
[1:36:55] GOD can deliver US FROM THE FURNACE.
[1:36:58] BUT IF NOT,
[1:37:01] I DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME. I
[1:37:04] WILL NOT [screaming] BOW.
[1:37:06] IF NOT,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT BOW,
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; GOD MAY NEVER TAKE ME THROUGH THINGS
[1:37:13] THAT I'M PRAYING FOR.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; BUT IF NOT, I WILL HOLD MY TESTIMONY.
[1:37:21] SOMETIMES WE PRAY, WE PRAY, LORD, HEAL
[1:37:24] MY BODY,
[1:37:26] BUT IF NOT,
[1:37:28] I'M STANDING IN SATAN'S EDEN.
[1:37:31] IS THERE A YOUNG PERSON HERE WHO FEELS A
[1:37:34] TEMPTATION
[1:37:37] but says, "I WILL NOT GO THAT WAY.
[1:37:41] I WILL NOT FOLLOW SIN.
[1:37:44] I'VE GOT A DESIRE TO GET MARRIED. BUT IF
[1:37:47] I NEVER GET MARRIED,
[1:37:50] if not,
[1:37:52] I WILL STAND.
[1:37:55] I WILL NOT GO IN THE WORLD TO FIND A
[1:37:57] WIFE.
[1:37:58] I WILL STAND FOR GOD. [screaming]
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; IF HE NEVER GIVES TO ME THE DESIRE OF MY
[1:38:06] HEART,
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; IF NOT, I KNOW WHO I AM.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE I COME FROM.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO.
[1:38:18] AMEN.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:38:24] Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; No matter what you've been praying for,
[1:38:28] Have faith.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; What if you never get it? Be determined
[1:38:32] to stand.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say in this in a
[1:38:39] sermon here,
[1:38:41] he says, "Give me a church that's so
[1:38:44] completely anointed with God
[1:38:47] till their every action and move is thus
[1:38:50] saith THE LORD." HE SAYS, "WALK IN THAT
[1:38:53] SHIKINA GLORY.
[1:38:57] AND I'LL SHOW YOU a Messiah,
[1:39:00] an anointed one of God
[1:39:03] standing upon the earth.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; SO, WHO ARE YOU?
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU?
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD CREATED YOU, HE CREATED THE
[1:39:13] BEST.
[1:39:15] NEVER LET SATAN DRAG YOU INTO THE WORLD.
[1:39:18] YOU ARE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:39:21] STAND IN THE DAY WHEN NO ONE WANTS TO
[1:39:24] STAND.
[1:39:26] STAND FOR GOD.

[1:40:01] There's a there's a quote that brother
[1:40:04] and and if you you don't mind standing
[1:40:07] for just a few moments.
[1:40:09] We've been seated long. There's a quote
[1:40:12] that brother Ken shared with me and I
[1:40:15] had a few that I was looking at already.
[1:40:19] Well, brother, if your your vocal cords
[1:40:20] can't work, I have more people. Don't
[1:40:22] you worry. Go go go and rest. Listen in
[1:40:26] in questions and answers 59.
[1:40:29] I
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I just want We've already heard the
[1:40:32] preaching. I'm just saying a few things
[1:40:33] here. Listen, he says, "What about that,
[1:40:36] brother Mike?
[1:40:38] Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that
[1:40:40] wonderful?
[1:40:43] He loved you.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; He loved you before there was a world.
[1:40:48] He know your nature.
[1:40:51] He know your weaknesses.
[1:40:54] He know your habits.
[1:40:57] Habits.
[1:41:00] He know all about you
[1:41:04] and what he was going to be.
[1:41:08] And then when he looked all over the
[1:41:11] great universe
[1:41:13] as it was, he said, "I choose you."
[1:41:20] And when he did that before there was
[1:41:23] ever a speck of light,
[1:41:26] then you are eternal with God.
[1:41:30] When you receive the Holy Ghost, then
[1:41:32] you become eternal. Because you are with
[1:41:35] God. You are a part of God.
[1:41:38] Can you see what I mean? You are eternal
[1:41:39] as God is.
[1:41:43] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; And listen, you know, a brother, you
[1:41:48] know, threw a lot of nuggets there.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; He said, um, no matter what happens,
[1:41:56] the throne is my purpose.
[1:42:01] Amen.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; The throne is my purpose. If God know
[1:42:05] knew all about me,
[1:42:07] but then he chose me. So no matter what
[1:42:10] happens,
[1:42:12] the throne is my purpose.
[1:42:15] The throne is my purpose. I believe
[1:42:17] that's what was in David's heart.
[1:42:21] No matter what happens, the throne is my
[1:42:24] purpose.
[1:42:26] You see, Revelation 1:6,
[1:42:29] "And he has made us kings and priests.
[1:42:33] unto God and to his father.
[1:42:36] To him be glory and dominion forever and
[1:42:38] ever. Amen. And the prophet puts that in
[1:42:41] quotes
[1:42:43] and he says listen he
[1:42:46] has made us.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Oh there are certain truth that we need
[1:42:50] to emphasize.
[1:42:52] This is one of them. Can we say amen to
[1:42:55] that?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; He.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY SAY HE.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; HE. YEAH.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Now when I whenever I read this I become
[1:43:02] emotional in my heart. He not me. He
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; has made me.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; HE HAS MADE US.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; SALVATION IS HIS DOING.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Salvation is OF THE LORD.
[1:43:21] ALL OF GRACE.
[1:43:23] HE REDEEMED ME. HE REDEEMED US FOR A
[1:43:26] PURPOSE.
[1:43:28] HE BROUGHT US FOR A PURPOSE.
[1:43:31] WE ARE KINGS.
[1:43:34] WE ARE SPIRITUAL KINGS.
[1:43:37] BUT WE are going to be kings on earth
[1:43:38] with him when he's seated on his throne.
[1:43:42] But right now, WE ARE SPIRITUAL KINGS
[1:43:46] AND WE REIGN OVER SPIRITUAL KINGDOM.
[1:43:50] That's why when your body IS BEGINNING
[1:43:52] TO BEHAVE, TO MISBEHAVE,
[1:43:55] YOU CAN TELL IT TO BEHAVE.
[1:43:57] WHY? BECAUSE HE THAT IS IN YOU IS RULING
[1:44:01] OVER THE FLESH.
[1:44:04] AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE
[1:44:06] REALIZATION
[1:44:07] OF WHO YOU ARE.
[1:44:10] THE TRUE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST,
[1:44:13] the bride is likened to pure gold.
[1:44:22] HER RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:44:24] SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT the being
[1:44:26] righteous,
[1:44:28] YOUR righteousness
[1:44:30] is his righteousness.
[1:44:34] SO we are not talking about the
[1:44:35] righteousness of your works.
[1:44:38] YOU KNOW, we have heard, you know, you
[1:44:39] can have ALL THESE BAD WORKS, but we're
[1:44:42] talking about his righteousness.
[1:44:46] She is to REFLECT
[1:44:49] WHAT HE HAS. SHE IS TO MANIFEST.
[1:44:55] THERE IS NO FAULT IN HER.
[1:45:00] Do you think he DOESN'T KNOW YOUR
[1:45:01] WEAKNESSES AND ALL THESE THINGS? BUT
[1:45:03] THEN HE SAY THERE IS NO FAULT IN HER.
[1:45:08] I don't know WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BUT
[1:45:11] YOU KNOW THIS is a proclamation
[1:45:14] from THE PROPHET OF THIS AGE.
[1:45:18] [screaming]

[1:45:23] this. Amen. It's just a short quote here
[1:45:26] SAYS YOU SEE WHAT SHE IS HER IDENTITY IS
[1:45:28] FOUND IN HIM
[1:45:32] what he is she IS TO REFLECT WHAT HE HAS
[1:45:38] meaning Christ
[1:45:40] SHE IS TO MANIFEST.
[1:45:42] THERE IS NO FAULT IN HER.
[1:45:45] I wonder whether you can put it on your
[1:45:47] lips. SAY THERE IS NO FAULT IN ME.
[1:45:51] LISTEN, WE'RE NOT trying to make you
[1:45:53] just believe something from somewhere.
[1:45:57] I believe this is thus says the Lord for
[1:46:00] our generation.
[1:46:02] WE ARE THE GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS.
[1:46:05] THERE IS [screaming] NO FAULT IN ME.

[1:46:13] BEGINNING TO ENDING. SHE IS THE WORK OF
[1:46:16] HER LORD

[1:46:22] [laughter]
[1:46:23] AMEN. ALL HIS [screaming] WORKS ARE
[1:46:26] PERFECT.
[1:46:28] I AM A WORK OF THE LORD.

[1:46:33] MY FAULTS. YOU MAY KNOW MY PROBLEMS. BUT
[1:46:37] LET ME TELL YOU, I AM THE WORK OF MY
[1:46:38] LORD.

[1:47:15] AND MANIFESTED
[1:47:17] THE ETERNAL WISDOM

[1:47:23] of God.
[1:47:26] THINK ABOUT it
[1:47:28] just like I'm thinking about myself
[1:47:29] RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHY I'M EXCITED. AMEN.
[1:47:33] REGARDLESS OF ALL THIS, you know, this
[1:47:36] and that. Sometimes you young people
[1:47:39] kneel down and say, "Oh Lord, take this
[1:47:40] away from me.
[1:47:42] FORGET ABOUT THAT. FOCUS ON THE THRONE.
[1:47:48] THAT'S [screaming] WHY YOU ARE HERE FOR
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES LISTEN THE DEVIL BEATS YOU
[1:47:52] DOWN
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU CAN'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.
[1:47:57] MANY TIMES WHEN I FEEL SORRY ABOUT MY

[1:48:18] to think about it
[1:48:20] to IMAGINE IT? HOW can one understand
[1:48:23] it?
[1:48:26] Though we cannot do that,
[1:48:28] we can't understand it. We can accept it
[1:48:31] by faith
[1:48:34] [laughter]
[1:48:34] and and he finishes it like this. AND
