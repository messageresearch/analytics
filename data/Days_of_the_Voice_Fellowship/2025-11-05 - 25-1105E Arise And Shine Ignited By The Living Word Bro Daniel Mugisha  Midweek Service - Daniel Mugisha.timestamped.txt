[46:23] Thank the Lord who has enabled us to be
[46:25] here.
[46:29] I always don't like taking it for
[46:30] granted when uh we come to the house of
[46:33] the Lord
[46:38] because I because I believe he's here.
[46:43] That's why I really take it so personal
[46:48] and I just pray that you may take it
[46:50] personal. This is
[46:55] we shall just open the scriptures.
[46:56] Proverbs
[46:58] 25
[47:02] verse 25.
[47:18] Proverbs chapter 25 verse 2
[47:25] it says it is the glory of God to
[47:28] conceal a thing but the honor of the
[47:31] kings is to search out a matter. The
[47:35] heaven for for height and the earth for
[47:38] depth and the heart of kings is an is
[47:42] unarchable.
[47:43] Take away the drawers from the silver.
[47:46] And there shall come forth a vessel for
[47:49] the finer.
[47:51] Take away the wicked from before the
[47:54] king. And his throne shall be
[47:57] established in righteousness.
[48:00] May the word of the Lord be blessed. You
[48:02] can have your seats.
[48:09] So this evening I just have a a simple
[48:12] inspiration
[48:15] that the Lord has put on my heart.
[48:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; I just want us to be connected in one
[48:23] one accord
[48:26] that we may hear what the Lord is trying
[48:28] to tell us this evening.
[48:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. As you're seated
[48:35] there,
[48:37] keep praying
[48:39] that God may answer you.
[48:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; My simple inspiration is rise and shine.
[48:49] Rise and shine.
[48:52] Hallelujah.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:55] The word of God defines us
[48:59] to be the kings
[49:02] that are chosen are peculiar people.
[49:07] You are peculiar people.
[49:10] Never and never despise yourself.
[49:15] uh when you read when you go through
[49:17] this scripture that you have read
[49:21] the second verse it says it is the glory
[49:24] of God to conceal a thing
[49:28] that the honor of kings is to search out
[49:31] a matter
[49:36] how many have heard that
[49:38] it is the it is the honor of kings
[49:44] The Lord has made us kings and priests.
[49:49] It is our duty to search out a matter
[49:53] but God has concealed it.
[49:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He has hidden it
[50:02] but we have to search them out.
[50:06] We as the kings
[50:11] under that inspiration of rise and
[50:13] shine.
[50:16] I have an an other inspiration that is
[50:19] attached to it.
[50:23] Ignited by the living word.
[50:29] Ignited by the living word.
[50:34] I just want to tell you this evening
[50:36] But the word of God is very true for you
[50:39] to trust it.
[50:43] These are not just words
[50:46] that man sat down and wrote
[50:55] down the word of God.
[50:58] When we read it,
[51:01] search out a matter what God is trying
[51:03] to tell you.
[51:06] THIS EVENING WE ARE READING THIS word
[51:09] search out a matter
[51:12] then rise and shine.
[51:14] The devil may have tried to deceive
[51:18] because the greatest gateway of the
[51:20] devil
[51:22] is lying. IF HE LIES YOU and brings fear
[51:25] in your heart,
[51:27] you'll not rise and shine.
[51:33] Hallelujah. you not rise and shine.
[51:38] This evening, [laughter] I just want you
[51:39] to take this.
[51:42] The living word of God is true
[51:46] and it never fails.
[51:49] Hallelujah. I will not say that I'm an
[51:51] angel that we do not get uh some
[51:54] disturbances in life
[51:57] that we do not get down sometimes.
[52:01] Yeah, we get down.
[52:04] everyone
[52:06] even the prophet he wanted to kill
[52:08] himself he went up he said let this
[52:12] electricity just kill me
[52:15] sometimes you reach those moments and
[52:18] you say why CAN'T I JUST LEAVE WHY can't
[52:21] I just leave THIS MESSAGE
[52:23] WHY AM I frustrating myself but this
[52:26] evening I want to tell you
[52:29] just get ignited by THE LIVING WORD
[52:34] WHATEVER THE WORD HAS SAY,
[52:36] just believe it and go forward with it.
[52:40] When when things get rough,
[52:43] you also have to get rough.
[52:46] That's why when someone is driving a
[52:48] car,
[52:50] he reaches a muddy place,
[52:52] you put fourwheel.
[52:55] Hallelujah. I just want you TO PUT A
[52:58] FOUR WHEEL
[53:00] THIS EVENING.
[53:03] Things will not always be just walking.
[53:07] I want you to put now a for
[53:11] a for gear
[53:15] whatever but I think you have understood
[53:18] it. I just want you to put another gear
[53:22] in your life, in your faith, in the
[53:26] trust that you put in the Lord.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. And say, what does God
[53:37] want me to do?
[53:39] What has God put in this trouble my
[53:42] life?
[53:45] What has the Lord put in this message
[53:47] that I'm here?
[53:51] What? What? What am I? What am I here to
[53:53] do?
[53:55] Am I just Am I just going to live and
[53:58] die?
[54:01] No. Search out a matter
[54:06] in everything. Search out a matter.
[54:09] When you get the matter in the whatever
[54:12] you're searching,
[54:14] then rise and shine and reflect to that.
[54:20] Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; You just have to rise and shine and
[54:24] identify yourself with what you have
[54:26] searched.
[54:29] It is like a student
[54:31] when you study.
[54:34] Yeah. You'll be you'll be proud of
[54:36] yourself that I know this. I know this.
[54:39] You can even stand before people and
[54:41] explain.
[54:43] Hallelujah. So I want you to like search
[54:48] out a matter
[54:52] in this situation that you may be in.
[55:00] There's no situation that God brings
[55:03] along your way
[55:06] that brings to distract you.
[55:11] It is either you you are not IN YOUR
[55:13] POSITION
[55:16] THERE'S SOMETHING THE LORD WANTS you to
[55:18] learn.
[55:20] So what what is the matter?
[55:26] The main goal is
[55:28] the Lord has something better for you in
[55:30] that situation.
[55:35] We cast him out.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; We see Job,
[55:40] &gt;&gt; he got sicknesses,
[55:43] but the Lord had permitted it.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; He had permitted it.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; But the truth is, reality is hard to eat
[55:54] Job.
[55:56] Realities had to hit Job.
[56:00] He complained a little bit,
[56:04] but when he heard the word of God that
[56:08] Elu preached to him,
[56:11] God united
[56:14] and he went back to his feet and he had
[56:17] to shine again. I WANT YOU TO SHINE
[56:21] AGAIN.
[56:22] I want you to rise and shine again.
[56:26] Tell the devil, "You're too late.
[56:30] WHATEVER YOUR
[56:34] HALLELUJAH,
[56:35] this battle was already won.
[56:40] It's just you searching out a matter in
[56:41] that battle. They fought for me."
[56:49] Like you have to search out a matter of
[56:51] the battle that the Lord fought for you.
[56:56] and say the devil,
[56:58] the Lord fought for me. HE PAID
[57:02] &gt;&gt; FOR EVERYTHING. HALLELUJAH.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And rise and shine.
[57:09] He will not dare put a hand on you.
[57:14] He will not dare put a hand on you. The
[57:16] devil will
[57:19] say, "You got me.
[57:21] You got me. day. Hallelujah.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Let me read you this uh quote
[57:28] from the message. Let your light so
[57:30] shine before men.
[57:33] Brother said here, I'm sure that's what
[57:37] we are all here for
[57:40] correction and to get an understanding
[57:42] of what we can do to make us better
[57:45] Christian.
[57:48] If I have one thing in my life that I
[57:50] desire,
[57:52] you will be a better Christian than I
[57:54] am.
[57:56] And I am sure that the hearts crying of
[58:00] uh let me read again. And I'm sure that
[58:02] the hearts cry of every soul that is
[58:05] here tonight is to be a better
[58:08] Christian.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; MY FRIEND, I want to tell you, you came
[58:11] here to BE A BETTER CHRISTIAN. YOU COME
[58:14] HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LORD CAN
[58:15] REALLY work sort your issues.
[58:19] YOU CAME HERE because you still have
[58:20] hope. [screaming]
[58:22] Many people have said you will not even
[58:24] attend church.
[58:29] But you came here because you have hope.
[58:33] Hallelujah. Amen. We can rise and shine.
[58:38] This is our age.
[58:40] Hallelujah. Amen. No wonder the prophet
[58:43] when he drew the the the seven church
[58:44] ages
[58:47] he said there was light
[58:51] in every age.
[58:55] Who are that light?
[58:59] It's you AND ME.
[59:02] HALLELUJAH. It's you and me. We have to
[59:05] rise and shine again.
[59:09] Hallelujah. Amen. rise [screaming] and
[59:11] shine.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my,
[59:15] &gt;&gt; let's just if if there's anything that
[59:20] hinders you.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Last time we were sharing about uh last
[59:25] Friday on the overnight.
[59:29] We shared about uh take take the baton.
[59:36] No, take the baton that like
[59:41] that they give out.
[59:45] [laughter]
[59:48] I I know all of you in school
[59:52] to run that you used to run and you give
[59:55] out the baton. You give out the baton
[59:58] and another one runs runs runs and gives
[1:00:01] another one and gives another one.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:07] When I I had that inspiration,
[1:00:10] I forgot actually
[1:00:12] brought you something.
[1:00:15] I saw a matchbox
[1:00:19] and I said, "Uh, this matchbox,
[1:00:23] if you you have if you how do they call
[1:00:26] it like,
[1:00:32] you get out that match stick
[1:00:35] and you pack that matchbox
[1:00:39] and fire comes out."
[1:00:41] I just want us to type it to the word of
[1:00:43] God.
[1:00:45] You are that maybe that thing
[1:00:49] that you have to get scratched that
[1:00:51] MATCHBOX
[1:00:53] LIGHT.
[1:00:55] HALLELUJAH. That matchbox if I would put
[1:00:58] it anywhere here on
[1:01:00] that is flammable.
[1:01:02] IT CAN BURN this whole world. Something
[1:01:05] will connect to the other thing. It will
[1:01:08] connect to the other one. It will
[1:01:09] connect the other one. It will connect
[1:01:11] and connect and connect.
[1:01:14] burn almost the whole world just of one
[1:01:17] stick. WHAT OF A BELIEVER WHO HAS BEEN
[1:01:20] IGNITED BY the word of the Lord?
[1:01:24] YOU CAN BURN AND SHINE
[1:01:29] and burn all the things of the devil
[1:01:34] and burn all the territory of the devil.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Just one seed, just one believer.
[1:01:44] Hallelujah.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Just one believer.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Just don't look at a group.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; I think that's why the Lord said in in
[1:01:56] the with the Gentiles,
[1:01:59] he deals with an individual.
[1:02:04] He deals with an individual.
[1:02:06] An individual can spark out light that
[1:02:09] will shine to THE ENTIRE WORLD.
[1:02:17] WE SEE AFTER after the that period when
[1:02:21] uh uh
[1:02:23] that there's a period in the seven
[1:02:25] church ages that the dark ages around
[1:02:28] there.
[1:02:32] But what did that light again come from?
[1:02:37] Where did it come from again to shine?
[1:02:42] You see that is still lighting up to
[1:02:44] now.
[1:02:48] It is maybe it was one believer,
[1:02:52] ONE believer
[1:02:54] and that's why the Lord says where two
[1:02:56] or three are gathered or where two
[1:02:58] believe and agree.
[1:03:05] Yeah. when they believe or when they
[1:03:07] come together
[1:03:09] in the Lord, yeah, he will be a
[1:03:11] minister.
[1:03:13] I just want one fellow believe
[1:03:18] to just believe and catch THE FIRE AND
[1:03:20] RISE AND SHINE [screaming]
[1:03:23] in this world. IT IS THE END TIME. NO
[1:03:27] MORE TIME TO SHINE. It is now.
[1:03:31] Now. Now. It is our time to shine.
[1:03:36] That's why the prophet say that THE
[1:03:38] BRIGHT SHORT QUICK WORK
[1:03:41] YOU SHINE
[1:03:43] TO SHINE your brother
[1:03:45] that when YOU LIGHT
[1:03:48] YOUR light will shine onto other people
[1:03:52] and they will glorify God.
[1:03:55] You attract your brothers
[1:03:58] and will make the full bride.
[1:04:02] My friends, this is our time.
[1:04:05] This is my time. Tell your neighbor.
[1:04:08] This is my time.
[1:04:11] This is our time.
[1:04:14] FRIENDS, MANY things have have come
[1:04:16] along the way.
[1:04:18] But let us keep pressing on. Let us keep
[1:04:22] pressing.
[1:04:24] Hallelujah.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Let's keep focused.
[1:04:32] Hallelujah.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; In the in the message the great sh the
[1:04:37] great shining light
[1:04:40] the prophet said and if you will ch you
[1:04:43] will not and if you'll notice
[1:04:48] God only reveals himself to those who
[1:04:51] search and long to see him.
[1:04:56] Draw nigh unto me. I will draw nigh unto
[1:04:59] you and I will draw nigh unto you,
[1:05:05] sayaith the Lord.
[1:05:07] And sometimes
[1:05:08] God lets things happen so that we can
[1:05:11] draw nigh unto him.
[1:05:15] GOD HAS surely ordained that certain
[1:05:17] events must take place and THEY WILL
[1:05:20] UNFOLD JUST AS THIS great they will
[1:05:24] unfold just as this great time clock
[1:05:28] ticks it off.
[1:05:40] The mystery that was hidden from ages
[1:05:44] AGES
[1:05:47] in this age
[1:05:49] and where the people hallelujah. Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; I was listening to some message
[1:05:55] brother was saying that he was on a
[1:05:59] journey and he saw a signpost. He was
[1:06:02] showing hungry
[1:06:05] just hungry.
[1:06:09] said after some meters then they posted
[1:06:12] they had to put another

[1:06:23] when you look at it
[1:06:28] you'll just be there
[1:06:30] maybe there's something
[1:06:33] maybe there's foodmen
[1:06:40] So he said
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; like all those advertisements
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; are paid for.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; And he said
[1:06:53] we are the billboards of God.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; We are the billboards.
[1:07:06] They pay for them.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; But he has sponsored these billboards.
[1:07:11] We
[1:07:16] he has sponsored us to be the
[1:07:18] billboards.
[1:07:21] Rise your feet and shine.
[1:07:25] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:28] Rise your feet and shine. Let's read
[1:07:32] Isaiah 6
[1:07:35] verse 1 to5
[1:07:37] it says
[1:07:39] arise

[1:07:46] of the Lord is shine upon thee for
[1:07:49] behold the darkness shall cover the
[1:07:51] earth

[1:09:07] the the Israelites that was on them.
[1:09:12] This was a prophecy
[1:09:14] that the the it will shine to us the
[1:09:17] gentile.
[1:09:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And is now shining.
[1:09:26] Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; In our camp,
[1:09:29] IT IS SHINING
[1:09:31] IN YOUR CHURCH.
[1:09:35] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:41] Let's just rise and shine
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; because the word of God
[1:09:50] is here to ignite us.
[1:09:56] It is here to ignite every one of you.
[1:10:02] Every one of you.
[1:10:04] Just get hungry for this one.
[1:10:08] Hallelujah.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Oh God, I want to see.
[1:10:13] I want to see what you said in your
[1:10:15] word.
[1:10:17] I just want to put a challenge
[1:10:20] to this word."
[1:10:22] Say, "Oh God, YOU SAID THIS.
[1:10:25] PUT IT TO A CHALLENGE.
[1:10:33] Just be right with it.
[1:10:36] a challenge.
[1:10:38] If he fails,
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; then leave God.
[1:10:49] Hallelujah.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Be right.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Don't just ask God that God this, this,
[1:10:56] and this, this, and this, this, and
[1:10:57] this, this, and this, this, and this.
[1:10:59] And then for you, you've not played your
[1:11:01] part.
[1:11:06] That's what we as many believers, we do
[1:11:09] that mistake.
[1:11:12] We blame God. WE SAY, "OH GOD, THIS, OH
[1:11:14] GOD, OH GOD." But we do not. We do not
[1:11:18] look at our side.
[1:11:21] Hallelujah. We do not look at what it is
[1:11:24] like pointing at someone that you made a
[1:11:26] mistake.
[1:11:32] But I believe the Lord does not make a
[1:11:34] mistake.
[1:11:36] Hallelujah.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; It's we that MAKE MISTAKES.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I want you to get ignited by THE WORD
[1:11:43] AND LEAVE THOSE MISTAKES THAT
[1:11:46] [screaming]
[1:11:46] burn the mistakes away.
[1:11:52] Just identify your mistakes and say,
[1:11:53] "Oh, God, I'm sorry."
[1:11:57] AND THEN MOVE ON.
[1:12:00] SEE THE THE WORD OF THE Lord shining in
[1:12:02] your life,
[1:12:04] shining in your family,
[1:12:07] SHINING IN YOUR CHURCH.
[1:12:09] BROTHER ARAB SAYS the pastor does not
[1:12:12] come with uh does NOT COME WITH REVIVAL
[1:12:14] in his briefcase.
[1:12:18] IT DOES NOT. REVIVAL COMES FROM US.
[1:12:23] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. You hear THE WORD OF
[1:12:25] GOD UNITED, REVIVAL COMES.
[1:12:30] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:12:33] When you read the the history of uh like
[1:12:36] the way revival used to come,
[1:12:41] it is a person got so hungry, he got
[1:12:45] frustrated,
[1:12:48] said whatever comes I want.
[1:12:54] the world survivor. How many like if you
[1:12:57] go on YouTube, you'll watch its
[1:13:04] people got
[1:13:06] on fire.
[1:13:09] People reached a point of pledging
[1:13:11] allegiance and say I will follow the the
[1:13:13] Lord.
[1:13:15] a mother who had a baby
[1:13:19] like you see sister charity there
[1:13:22] he gives the child to brother Isach
[1:13:26] when they're killing people because of
[1:13:27] Christianity
[1:13:29] he says I'm here
[1:13:34] WHAT IS THAT
[1:13:37] WHAT IS that
[1:13:40] can any manufacture that
[1:13:44] being ignited by the WORD THE WORD
[1:13:46] BECOMING TRUE TO YOU. [screaming]
[1:13:51] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; You just feel like you're connected like
[1:13:58] electricity. When you connect the wires,
[1:13:59] you just SEE
[1:14:03] the one one cable here,
[1:14:08] the light will go off.
[1:14:11] But now when you bring it back,
[1:14:15] you'll see again life.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; There's a disconnection.
[1:14:20] There's a disconnection among the
[1:14:22] believers.
[1:14:24] Disconnect
[1:14:26] that we need TO CONNECT
[1:14:29] AND SHINE AGAIN
[1:14:31] AND RISE AND SHINE. [screaming]
[1:14:34] HALLELUJAH. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR YOU HAVE
[1:14:35] TO RISE AND shine
[1:14:38] building.
[1:14:40] THIS MESSAGE. YOU HAVE [screaming] TO
[1:14:42] REFLECT the Lord.
[1:14:49] We are the light.
[1:14:52] Hallelujah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Friends, I want to tell you, we are the
[1:14:56] light.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; If you deem, who is going to lie?
[1:15:06] If you deem in your life,
[1:15:11] who will who will lie to the world?
[1:15:16] But friends, I want to tell you,
[1:15:18] the Lord has given us another chance
[1:15:22] this evening.
[1:15:25] Brother Barnham also talks about like
[1:15:27] taking the word of God like an
[1:15:29] emergency.
[1:15:33] Brother Julius on Sunday he preached.
[1:15:37] He said when when a preacher comes here
[1:15:41] and preaches something
[1:15:44] it is an emergency
[1:15:46] that you have to work ON RIGHT AWAY.
[1:15:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:51] FRIENDS, this is our time to sh
[1:15:55] our time to rise and shine.
[1:15:58] Others is our day. It is your time to
[1:16:00] rise and shine.
[1:16:02] The young men is our time TO RISE AND
[1:16:04] [screaming] SHINE. I BELIEVE GOD DOES
[1:16:07] NOT HAVE ANY OTHER YOUNG MEN.
[1:16:10] [screaming] ME AND YOU. HE DOES NOT HAVE
[1:16:13] YOUNG GIRLS BUT YOU AND YOUR SISTER.
[1:16:17] You that are here.
[1:16:20] Hallelujah. We have stationed you here
[1:16:22] in

[1:16:37] here in Uganda have many districts
[1:16:40] and he also has representatives there.
[1:16:47] RISE AND SHINE.
[1:16:49] MAKE IT A CHALLENGE.
[1:16:53] Test the Lord.
[1:16:57] test the Lord.
[1:17:00] Justice him.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Just say tell the Lord.
[1:17:09] You said we are the light.
[1:17:13] So help may be the light.
[1:17:16] Hallelujah.
[1:17:21] Put a challenge.
[1:17:24] put a challenge.
[1:17:27] There's no any other peculiar people
[1:17:32] but we
[1:17:38] can think about that.
[1:17:44] Do you think they will the scientist
[1:17:46] will tell us there's another planet that
[1:17:48] has peculiar people?
[1:17:55] What report will you believe?
[1:17:59] This
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; this already already tells us
[1:18:06] we are the chosen.
[1:18:10] Rise and shine
[1:18:14] at your workplace
[1:18:16] with your friends.
[1:18:21] Just rise and shine.
[1:18:26] Let me not take it far
[1:18:29] here at church.
[1:18:33] Rise and shine.
[1:18:39] Just rise your feet
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; and shine.
[1:18:44] Hallelujah.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Because it is yours.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Why do I say it is yours?
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; The receipt is here.
[1:18:59] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; If they ask you
[1:19:04] that who are you
[1:19:06] that you're going to rise and shine,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; the receipt is here
[1:19:12] and tells me he paid for it.
[1:19:18] Hallelujah.
[1:19:22] Let me tell nothing good comes without a
[1:19:24] challenge.
[1:19:34] nothing in LIFE
[1:19:38] even Jesus had to come to die to pay
[1:19:46] and the word of God tells us
[1:19:49] that shall we leave him to bear the
[1:19:51] cross
[1:19:54] we are part of him.
[1:19:59] He's the head and we're the body.
[1:20:02] So that means we are part of him.
[1:20:05] But he paid for it all.
[1:20:09] Hallelujah. Is our duty to just identify
[1:20:13] just ourselves with him
[1:20:18] and say my husband paid for you
[1:20:22] which is the Lord.
[1:20:30] Friends, I don't know why I'm feeling
[1:20:31] this
[1:20:34] been on me for so long.
[1:20:36] But that everyone like we have to rise
[1:20:39] AND
[1:20:42] IS ENOUGH.
[1:20:44] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:47] Enough is enough.
[1:20:51] If the the word of God has told me
[1:20:54] something
[1:20:57] and I type myself in it,
[1:21:01] I have to rise and say, "This is mine."
[1:21:07] Like
[1:21:10] said, "Give me my mountain.
[1:21:12] Give me my mountain."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:21:18] He was identified with it.
[1:21:24] Friends, I don't want you to get ignited
[1:21:25] by a preacher
[1:21:31] or an excitement.
[1:21:38] Because
[1:21:40] if any other thing ignites you,
[1:21:44] if this money that ignites you,
[1:21:50] If this may be a booming business that
[1:21:52] ignates,
[1:21:56] my friend, the word of God again says
[1:21:59] that heaven and earth will pass up.
[1:22:04] But the word of God,
[1:22:08] Hallelujah. If I want to give you
[1:22:10] something that can ignite you,
[1:22:14] it is the word of God.
[1:22:17] because it will never fail you. IT IS A
[1:22:20] SURE DEAL.
[1:22:23] A sure deal that you have to lie.
[1:22:29] Though sometimes we don't believe we
[1:22:36] say but I've tried
[1:22:40] I've tried but
[1:22:43] it is not again working.
[1:22:47] The preacher told us that the word of
[1:22:49] God can ignite us.
[1:22:53] But now I've tried to to to
[1:22:58] myself
[1:23:01] but it is failing.
[1:23:07] Maybe you like when you put a matchbox
[1:23:09] in water [laughter]
[1:23:11] and you come and
[1:23:18] That's what most of us believers do.
[1:23:24] Then you come and scratch yourself.
[1:23:27] [screaming] Yet the word of God, you've
[1:23:28] just put aside. You put it in a
[1:23:31] condition that cannot work.
[1:23:37] You come and scratch.
[1:23:40] Now I've come now.
[1:23:43] Yet you in a wrong condition. You put it
[1:23:46] in A WRONG CONDITION.
[1:23:48] NO. Like the the word of God. You put it
[1:23:51] in a wrong condition.
[1:23:54] It is like putting a plant
[1:23:58] in a box. If you get a bean, you put it
[1:24:01] in a box.
[1:24:04] They say that a seed has life.
[1:24:07] Now let me put it there. Now
[1:24:10] is safe there. No one will take IT BUT
[1:24:14] YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN IT. YOU HAVE JUST
[1:24:15] GIVEN it a a like you've stored it so
[1:24:19] well
[1:24:22] but you have not given it the required
[1:24:25] conditions
[1:24:28] the ground.
[1:24:30] Hallelujah. And then the seed has come
[1:24:34] and rise and shine. That's why you see
[1:24:37] flowers,
[1:24:39] it comes out, it blossoms
[1:24:44] out out from the ground. This flesh of
[1:24:48] ours, it is the ground and the seed is
[1:24:52] in our soul.
[1:24:55] Hallelujah.
[1:24:58] Put your body in a good condition
[1:25:02] and watch
[1:25:06] that seed
[1:25:08] that is in you.
[1:25:10] Hallelujah. The seed of the word that
[1:25:11] has been preached, the seed of the word
[1:25:14] that you have read.
[1:25:19] Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; I think I've been so long. Am I so long?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Let us see where we can
[1:25:36] Oh, I still have some time.
[1:25:39] Hallelujah. [clears throat]
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Let's read this quote here.
[1:25:45] Brother Brham says,
[1:25:47] "You are a star.
[1:25:52] Every Christian is a star,
[1:25:57] to guide the lost,
[1:25:59] to guide the weary.
[1:26:02] How many have heard that?
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; The foot of the traveler,
[1:26:09] to those that are seeking,
[1:26:12] then the star cannot be guided by
[1:26:14] itself.
[1:26:18] Let me read again.
[1:26:20] The star cannot be guided by.
[1:26:25] It must be led by the spirit.
[1:26:28] It must reflect the brilliancancy of God
[1:26:31] in in its life.
[1:26:36] Abstain from the things of the world.
[1:26:39] And to live godly and soberly in that
[1:26:42] presence, in that present life,
[1:26:46] it must reflect the light of its great
[1:26:48] one that shined.
[1:26:54] We are the stars that are going to
[1:26:55] shine.
[1:26:57] But we cannot shine on our own.
[1:27:00] We are shining by this word.
[1:27:04] Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] We all know the word of God is God
[1:27:10] himself
[1:27:13] and the spirit is God himself.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:22] So this is not your own like you'll your
[1:27:25] own efforts
[1:27:29] that you're going to sit down
[1:27:32] and say how can I
[1:27:34] make this circuit work for me
[1:27:39] and light this
[1:27:42] light this
[1:27:44] or I have to read maybe other books.
[1:27:49] It is not your work.
[1:27:54] It is God's
[1:27:57] that has already been done already.
[1:28:02] Hallelujah.
[1:28:04] It's as just rising.
[1:28:07] You rise and be in your position
[1:28:11] and shine.
[1:28:15] If all believers here can do that,
[1:28:21] As you have read here, we all come here
[1:28:24] to be better to come here to be better
[1:28:26] Christians.
[1:28:29] We pray to God say, "Oh God, make me a
[1:28:31] better Christian."
[1:28:34] Because he said in his word when he
[1:28:37] comes,
[1:28:41] we shall be like him.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:45] Sometimes you look at yourself
[1:28:48] and you say, "How will I even look if
[1:28:50] God comes now?"
[1:28:55] Just keep cleaning yourself.
[1:28:58] Keep cleaning.
[1:29:00] The time he comes, you'll be clean.
[1:29:05] Hallelujah.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Just keep cleaning yourself.
[1:29:15] Just keep working on yourself
[1:29:18] through the word of God.
[1:29:23] Sometimes I I I always ask myself
[1:29:28] when my back is against the wall.
[1:29:34] What does God want me to do here?
[1:29:42] I ask what does God sometimes in when
[1:29:46] you're crying you God good God what do
[1:29:47] you want me to do
[1:29:53] sometimes you you fail to pray you just
[1:29:57] you just like in your mind you you
[1:30:00] you're speaking as thousand words
[1:30:06] what does God want
[1:30:09] in this matter that has come in my life.
[1:30:13] Hallelujah.
[1:30:16] [snorts]
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; You ask yourself,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; you think sometimes you even ask friends
[1:30:24] and friends don't help you.
[1:30:27] You feel you are alone.
[1:30:30] But I want to tell you this secret.
[1:30:35] This word
[1:30:36] promised,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; God will not forsake.
[1:30:42] Hallelujah.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; God will not forsake you.
[1:30:47] Hallelujah.
[1:30:50] Amen.
[1:30:52] God will not forsake you.
[1:30:59] Let me tell you
[1:31:02] if right now
[1:31:06] Maybe a lion enters here.
[1:31:11] Is this
[1:31:13] is it okay?
[1:31:18] If comes here,
[1:31:22] you see like mommy,
[1:31:25] he loves his children.
[1:31:28] But if it comes,
[1:31:36] everyone will run for you.
[1:31:41] Say, "OH MY GOD,
[1:31:44] you remember when you're out."
[1:31:51] Hallelujah.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; But who protects that child?
[1:31:58] Sometimes you see here we don't have
[1:32:01] anything here.
[1:32:03] Someone can jump from there and
[1:32:14] to save the life.
[1:32:20] But God never forsakes us.
[1:32:25] Hallelujah.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Even when you pass there,
[1:32:28] he's going to protect you,
[1:32:31] even when you get you get an injury.
[1:32:35] Sometimes I remember when we were at
[1:32:37] school.
[1:32:40] We used to sleep in the morning preps,
[1:32:42] they they tell you go for morning prep,
[1:32:44] go for mornings.
[1:32:48] You're tired, you don't want to wake up.
[1:32:51] And then they come with a cane. the
[1:32:52] teacher comes and
[1:32:55] you don't know where the sleep goes.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; You even don't know. You'll find
[1:33:00] yourself outside.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; We used to look at some children. They
[1:33:05] used to come from on the on top from a
[1:33:09] flood
[1:33:11] from a flood. Not even a
[1:33:15] up to down.
[1:33:20] And you wonder, you say, "How did he
[1:33:22] make it?" [clears throat]
[1:33:28] But still, God protected.
[1:33:32] Sometimes you have to to make a a
[1:33:36] suicidal. It will be like a suicidal
[1:33:38] move.
[1:33:42] Say, "Come what?" May
[1:33:45] I'm going to believe the word of God.
[1:33:49] And before you know,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; you've won.
[1:33:58] Hallelujah. Say, "I never knew that I
[1:34:00] would make it.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; I never knew that I would make it.
[1:34:06] Trust the Lord.
[1:34:11] Trust the Lord."
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Friends, I just want to tell you, trust
[1:34:17] the Lord.
[1:34:21] Hallelujah.
[1:34:25] Sometimes the Lord will cause you to
[1:34:26] make a move
[1:34:30] that you as a person
[1:34:34] like in your in your own efforts you
[1:34:36] cannot do.
[1:34:39] Say am I the one who jump from there?
[1:34:43] Am I the one really?
[1:34:49] Am I the one who really ran that fast?
[1:34:52] You look at yourself.
[1:34:55] But guess what?
[1:34:57] It is God.
[1:35:01] Hallelujah.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; I just want you to get ignited by the
[1:35:05] WORD
[1:35:07] AND RISE and shine.
[1:35:11] Hallelujah. Rise and shine. Rise to the
[1:35:14] challenges.
[1:35:17] God knows all the pressures of this
[1:35:19] world.
[1:35:22] He knows it well.
[1:35:27] He knows everything that we don't have
[1:35:29] money.
[1:35:32] Like in the minor church age,
[1:35:36] he said, "I KNOW YOUR POVERTY."
[1:35:40] HE SAID HE DID.
[1:35:45] He knows the poverty.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; THE LORD KNOWS EVERYTHING.
[1:35:53] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:54] When you go back home,
[1:35:57] say, "God, you know everything."
[1:36:03] God you even ALONG THE WAY
[1:36:06] I KNOW the devil is going to tell you
[1:36:10] what haven't you ever heard
[1:36:14] no preachers
[1:36:18] have come from abroad
[1:36:20] we have had youth meetings
[1:36:23] what haven't what haven't you done
[1:36:27] but maybe it is your time to rise AND
[1:36:28] SHINE AS A DEVIL OH, GET BEHIND ME.
[1:36:34] Enough is enough.
[1:36:38] And before you know, you're already
[1:36:40] shining.
[1:36:42] Hallelujah.
[1:36:44] You're already making a step to a better
[1:36:54] is the dangerous moves that we have to
[1:36:55] make.
[1:36:59] DANGEROUS ONE WHEREBY YOU YOU WILL CUT
[1:37:02] YOUR FRIENDS.
[1:37:05] You'll cut everything
[1:37:08] and say if God said this
[1:37:12] if he said I'm the light of the world.
[1:37:16] If he said I'm the salt of the world,
[1:37:21] then I have to rise and
[1:37:24] we are the people.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You are the people.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; You
[1:37:32] say me.
[1:37:35] I'm the one.
[1:37:39] So what are you SUPPOSED TO DO? RISE to
[1:37:42] every challenge.
[1:37:46] The Bible says
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; he has given like the greatest weapon
[1:37:50] that God has given us
[1:37:54] is prayer. Hallelujah.
[1:37:59] Not your life when you you're praying so
[1:38:01] much.
[1:38:06] just not
[1:38:08] I've seen it many times in my life
[1:38:13] sometimes I get disturbed things take me
[1:38:17] I end up praying
[1:38:19] but when again I realize I look back
[1:38:23] I say but the other life was better
[1:38:27] life was a bit light was light for me
[1:38:34] because of word. It was not I was not
[1:38:37] living on my own energy.
[1:38:40] I was just tapping from the living
[1:38:42] founding.
[1:38:45] When you're praying,
[1:38:48] you don't you don't just pray words.
[1:38:53] You refer to the word.
[1:38:57] You say, "God, you said this." Ah,
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; he said, "Lord, you'll strengthen the
[1:39:05] weak."
[1:39:12] He said, "Lord, even when we faint,
[1:39:16] I think it is
[1:39:29] He said those that that like trust in
[1:39:31] the Lord, he shall renew their strength.
[1:39:34] They shall mount their wings like ego
[1:39:36] eagles. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:39:39] They shall walk and not faint.
[1:39:42] Hallelujah.
[1:39:45] What what scripture do you want now
[1:39:51] to rise and shine
[1:39:54] and rising and shining
[1:39:58] is not always easy.
[1:40:02] You'll fall. You rise.
[1:40:08] you fall
[1:40:11] maybe you you nearly
[1:40:15] to that
[1:40:17] you slide
[1:40:19] but again you wake up
[1:40:24] and you make a step
[1:40:27] and you say I must shine
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; and shine after because you've been
[1:40:37] persist a persistent on it.
[1:40:42] Being persistent does not mean that you
[1:40:43] don't get discouraged.
[1:40:48] You get discouraged. You say no.
[1:40:51] You say, "Okay, I went and it didn't
[1:40:54] work.
[1:40:55] I'm going back."
[1:40:57] Maybe what? What? What? What is not
[1:41:00] right?
[1:41:01] You check You check around
[1:41:05] this one.
[1:41:07] Oh,
[1:41:09] you leave that
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; and then you'll end up shining and you
[1:41:18] you'll end up being in the position you
[1:41:19] want to be.
[1:41:25] Hallelujah.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:28] Brother here again says,
[1:41:32] "Although peculiar,
[1:41:36] yet the star was yet the star was
[1:41:38] brilliant.
[1:41:53] world world affair
[1:41:56] but brilliant as sacrifice before the
[1:41:59] Lord.
[1:42:02] We prostrate ourselves
[1:42:07] as maggis
[1:42:10] as the maggis magis.
[1:42:19] Okay,
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; you can say amen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; If you hear tongues and you don't
[1:42:25] understand.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:30] Huh? The mag that did that did in the
[1:42:33] presence of the of the king of kings to
[1:42:36] reflect his light.
[1:42:39] I think
[1:42:47] God bless you, brother Isaac. I think we
[1:42:49] got an interpretation.
[1:42:52] Hallelujah.
[1:42:54] Friends, my main message today.
[1:42:58] Rise and shine.
[1:43:02] Just rise and shine.
[1:43:05] As the musicians are coming
[1:43:21] I want us to just break that spiritual
[1:43:24] ice pack
[1:43:31] by the word of God,
[1:43:34] by the light that comes from
[1:43:43] What is the source of our light?
[1:43:47] It is God himself.
[1:43:51] So don't be worried that my light is is
[1:43:53] very small.
[1:43:56] It is the Lord is.
[1:44:00] Hallelujah.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:07] Like we have heard like those men,
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; brother Bernham says
[1:44:15] they rose and and gave their testimony
[1:44:22] and we see them shining.
[1:44:29] We can also make it now.
[1:44:33] Hallelujah.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Let me read this as uh these scriptures
[1:44:39] I'm finalizing
[1:44:41] in the book of Acts 12 verse 7 to 8.
[1:44:47] Uh
[1:44:49] it says, "And behold, the angel
[1:44:53] of the Lord came upon uh came onto him,
[1:44:56] and a light shined in the prison, and he
[1:44:59] smains
[1:45:08] fell off from his hands." And the angel
[1:45:11] said unto him, "Guard thyself, and bid
[1:45:15] on thy sandals." And so he did.
[1:45:21] He saith unto him, "Cast the garment out
[1:45:24] of thee, and follow me." Amen.
[1:45:55] As we are thinking about those
[1:45:56] scriptures,
[1:46:06] Peter was in prison.
[1:46:09] You may be in a certain prison,
[1:46:13] but the angel is telling you
[1:46:16] through his word
[1:46:20] that arise,
[1:46:22] arise.
[1:46:25] If you take this with urgency,
[1:46:33] it would help you.
[1:46:36] But if you just look it as any man's
[1:46:37] word
[1:46:41] then I don't know
[1:46:46] in John John chapter 1 verse 45
[1:46:52] it says
[1:46:54] in him was light in him was life
[1:46:58] and the life was the light of men
[1:47:02] and the light shineth in darkness
[1:47:05] and The darkness comprehends.
[1:47:12] In him was life.
[1:47:21] And the life was the light of men.
[1:47:25] And the light shineth in darkness,
[1:47:30] and the darkness comprehends me.
[1:47:39] Brother says,
[1:47:42] "You have got a sponsor tonight.
[1:47:47] Christ wants to sponsor you.
[1:47:50] If you want to let your light shine,
[1:47:54] be a billboard for him.
[1:47:57] Be a billboard for him.
[1:48:00] Won't you come
[1:48:03] be a billboard for me?
[1:48:05] Here is your sponsor.
[1:48:10] These are not my words for you.
[1:48:13] Even any if it was any other preacher,
[1:48:15] they're not his words. Even if the our
[1:48:19] pastor,
[1:48:21] whatever he speaks here, they're not his
[1:48:22] words.
[1:48:24] Just a mouthpiece.
[1:48:27] Even brother Brham was just a
[1:48:29] mouthpiece.
[1:48:31] It was God.
[1:48:37] He's your sponsor.
[1:48:45] Come and take him now.
[1:48:51] Shalom. As we sing,
[1:48:53] we walk in the light.
