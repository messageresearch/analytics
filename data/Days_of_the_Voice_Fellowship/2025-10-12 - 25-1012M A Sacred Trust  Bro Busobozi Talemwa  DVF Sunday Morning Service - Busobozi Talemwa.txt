[Music] I'm leaving my faith. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet you all in Jesus name. And you're most welcome in the house of God. I'm here to give you the report from the land fund. Uh today is week 10 and this is how we have contributed. Uh Paul contributed 65,000. [Applause] Uh then John Wasley 41,000. My God bless you so much. And then Martin contributed 120,000. Then Ianas contributed 160,000. [Applause] William Branham 280,000. My God bless you so much the members of William Branham. and then is followed by Martin Luther with 360,000. [Applause] Then Kumba has been the first today with 547,000. [Applause] My God bless you so much. Uh the members of Kumba. Then from the offering bag, we have 4,000 from the offering bag here. Then today we have a total of 1 1,577,000. Then overall total 13 million this is for 10 weeks 13,651,700. [Applause] Amen. May God bless you so much. I have some updates here uh that to give you. Uh we paid for our church land the first installment 100 million and we had a balance of uh a balance of 12 million and 500 and the agreement was to be paid in one year. So I have here an agreement I want to read for you. I know some of us come late but I believe uh we are going to stream it. I want to read here this portion. I hope all of us understand. This portion says that the purchaser shall pay the vendor uh 120 million and 500 shillings uh being the balance on the purchase on the purchase price of the land described in 12 months in installment of 30 millions shillings every 3 months. So uh from from the date of signing this agreement. So it means that every 3 months we have to pay 30 millions. Uh and we have so far moved 10 weeks. We are remaining with two weeks to make 3 months. And in 10 weeks we have contributed 13 millions. It means that uh we are remaining with 2 weeks to contribute to contribute the remaining balance which is about uh which is about 17 million is 16 16 million.4 four. This is according to the agreement. So our target we are we are supposed to contribute uh 30 millions in every 3 months. It means that every month we have to contribute 10 millions. That means we should contribute the average of of 2.5 millions per week. uh that means we are still below our target because according to what we contribute we have now uh 13 million and 600 in 10 weeks it means we have the average per week 1.36 millions praise the lord so we need to add more efforts uh in our groups we still have people who have never contributed to their commitment. You made a pledge and you made it to God. Uh there are so people think that by contributing you are you want to make us happy or to make the pastor happy. That means you have no revelation of why you are giving and by that you cannot be blessed. Praise God. You are giving to God. And whenever we call you to remind you of your balance, I don't think that we are we the money we we are the one who need it but we are also playing our part to make sure that the money is being banked. So, uh we need to work together and uh I want to comment on on some group like I have this group Cola [Music] it's not Cola is John Weasley. John Weasley is not performing well and I believe we have members there who can do the best. Praise God. This group has not been performing well. I don't know the if the problem is with leadership or if the problem is the people. So if it is leadership we we are going to work on that. We see if there is anyone willing to take leadership. John Wasley please you come to us. Uh we have ever done this. We had a group Martin it was group Martin and it was not performing well. Uh we changed leadership and since then it has been performing well. It is always in a 100 plus. Praise God. Uh so if you're a leader and your group is not performing well, you have to make sure at least you add some members who can push it. Praise God. Uh I want to thank the group Colomba. Let us clap for them once again. My God bless you so much. team leader Es done has done some good work by adding some members who can push it. So I think every team leader should take an example of that group because I see it has been performing well and today is has been the first praise God. If every group can contribute 500 if every group can contribute 500. So I think we shall be even above our what our target. Praise God. If every group can be like that group or like Martin Luther, we shall not pull a lot. Praise the Lord. So I believe that you should catch up the vision and you put something. Praise God. I believe every every person can give something. If you can you go home and you eat you eat food from Monday up to Sunday you are eating you have never slept hungry but how you cannot say that you come to the house of god even without supporting your group with 5k it is a shame for 10 weeks you have never contributed anything we have the list of the names I know people who have jobs if you don't have a job we shall understand but if you have a job. It's not right. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You have a job. You put food on the table every day, but you fail to contribute 5K. Praise God. You are taking us behind. That's not right and it's not acceptable. So team leaders uh we please you have to contact your members who are not giving and encourage them uh if the team leader maybe uh sometimes I think they are not using the polite language maybe they don't know how to convince the people I don't know but we need to understand that so my god bless you so [Music] God bless you, brother John. There's a testimony here. Says, "God bless you, saints. I greet you all in Jesus name. I thank God for the job opportunities he has granted me. May his name be glorified, the Gloria. God bless you." Amen. And thank God for that. Oh, he's a wonderful God. Praise the Lord. Let's get on our feet. As you shake somebody's hand, once again, greet them. Welcome them in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. [Music] I won't walk. I got [Music] to walk. I call you [Music] I walk my Truly mo [Music] is the way. Yeah. All is a way. Yeah. Oh, son.

I see um several are not here this morning. or yet. They're not here yet, but there's quite a lot we have to do this morning, especially before we get into the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? Amen. Amen. I I I see a letter here and I see Am I saying correctly? [Music] Let let us welcome this brother. &gt;&gt; Amen from lifeboat lifeboat. &gt;&gt; Brother, you have to remind me your name. I'm so sorry. I ah &gt;&gt; brother Francis, God bless you. &gt;&gt; I um the reason why I invited him here because I want you to read this. But also uh you know we met uh recently in Budo last year and he was you know announcing the youth their youth convention today and I've always watched the first time I saw him when we I went to their convention two years ago and I was I was moved. I even heard that u I heard something like someone mentioned they said okay their pastor almost was going to cancel their youth convention but the younger people came together and they said no pastor we shall support you stand behind you and since then they are the ones doing everything and so this brother is on the forefront of it I think he's the youth leader [Music] And I thought, brother, you can talk and announce this convention, but also while you're doing it, you'll be challenging our young people here. God bless you, brethren. I thank God for this opportunity. Bless you, pastor. A blessing to us as young people. Uh this morning as he said we met uh in I was supposed to be here last Sunday. The other Sunday I was supposed to be in. [Music] I was supposed to be there but I did everything and I failed. So God made it sure that we meet there with him such that this Sunday again we meet him. So we give God the glory without taking more time. I want to uh bring this to your attention that this year from 29th December to first next year That will be January January. &gt;&gt; By God's grace, we organizing an annual youth convention in our usual place. Gayaza High School and in this meeting you are required first to register and then you make your contribution 100,000 shillings. This money purposely cater for your accommodation and meals. for two full days and two half days. I don't know whether those are four days or three days. We have mathematicians here. So does your money goes I mean it supports you in all those all those days &gt;&gt; with good meals with good resting. Uh this program in the morning we always have preaching then afternoon we divide oursel according to the to the age. [Music] We have those married people. We have those unmarried but out of school. And we have those that are still in school and even the younger people, the little children. We assemble in different places and we invite ministers to talk to talk to us about the the life because after receiving the word we have also to look to our physical welfare. How we are going to hand oursel as younger people. Remember we are the next generation. they are handing uh this book the word to us. If they don't prepare us will be a disappointment to them. So that's the purpose why we gather and I believe is the same purpose why he calls the younger people. So I officially invite you the man looked to be much But if you lay down the calculations, you realize that you even paying less. I know he's having that experience. So I encourage the younger people. I always tell people to go back to the first church. But after Pentecost, they assembled themselves and they went back and brought whatever they had to support the gospel. So with the last church, let's copy from the first church. I urge you to stand with the pastor. I know immediately after our convention, you will be the rest. So let's hold our hands together. Let's hold our hands together. We'll see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, pastor, for this opportunity. God bless you, brethren. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we appreciate you, brother Francis, &gt;&gt; and the way you stand with your pastor. Uh I hope that you leave that anointing here. that some young people I know there are some who are already doing it but others will also [Music] amen um you know these youth conventions are always a blessing please don't say it is not our youth convention it is ours as long as they are going to teach the message I know they have prepared ministers and every ministry is different and every ministry is a blessing. So um let's try to make it and um I'm sure it will be a blessing. Um just to emphasize the dates are 29th December December to 1st January. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now um at this moment we um we have a baby dedication. But before the baby dedication, I'd like to I don't know if this Are they ready? &gt;&gt; Brother Dan, where is Sister Monica? &gt;&gt; Are you ready? cuz I don't see the brother here. &gt;&gt; Ah, he's hiding. &gt;&gt; Ah, okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know how they want to do it, but brother, it is your time. So, I'm giving you only five minutes. So, um I I don't know who to invite first, but I think I should invite Sister Monica because everybody knows her. Uh but she's saying no, I shouldn't invite her. Well, there's this I can invite brother Sad to come. Hallelujah. I know this is usually a stressful moment for you. [Music] Amen. God bless you, church. Actually, I'm so humbled and honored to stand before you this morning. [Music] &gt;&gt; I would request brother to translate for you. You want to speak these words? What is going to take place?

Let each one of us raise our hands and we pray for them. Look at this. Our heavenly father, I have here brother Sad and sister Monica that have sealed their engagement today. Dear Lord, you have done it in your presence and we know that everything that starts with you starts with you. And Lord, I know you are going to continue watching over them with many young people leaving anyhow they want to live. But Lord, you have your special one that will always submit to your guidance, submit to your leadership, submit to your word. And we have some of them here before me. Lord, I ask your blessing upon them. And Lord, I also pray the Lord you will sustain them and especially the man as he now will go to prepare himself so that he will come and and and and and collect his bride that you will provide for him father. May he find favor before you favor before men. May you open doors for him resources, Lord Jesus. Provide unto him, Father. He will have enough to come and consumate this marriage. Father, I also pray for grace upon Monica. Father, that you will give her guidance and grace that you protect her father as she is waiting patient for her brother to come and take over. May you protect both of them. Bless both of them. And in the name of Jesus, we pronounce them again. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Sadat &gt;&gt; is um uh I first received a call from um from him and you know he introduced himself to me &gt;&gt; and um he was still in Dubai at the time. Um, but I'm not surprised that uh he picked a somebody from this church [Music] because he has a a sister here. Can you stand up, sister Fibby? That's a sister to brother Sab. Amen. And so I also heard from brother Walter &gt;&gt; who is the pastor there the associate. I think the pastor is pastor and you also heard from their deacon who is actually I think a brother from Uganda and they told me about him and um also learned that he's a sister is a brother to sister Phy. But still I told him I as much as I've got all these recommendations about you and everything I'm not about to let my daughter go or to allow you to really get to know her that much until I've seen you. So, if you can please come. He was kind. He told me, "Pastor, I'll come." and he came and we've had um good time with him um you know to fellowship with him to get to know him and I think he's a brother that really loves the Lord and um so met them on several occasions [Music] and try and give them counsel you know in the marriage of the lamb brother Banham says A decision has to be made. To those of you who have gone through my hands when you are getting married, you know I emphasize this so much. I said after the decision, the decision has to be made. That one is a hold someone when you talk about a decision you don't just say I have feelings for so and so, so let me marry them. Ision a decision is made based on many things and that's what courtship is about you you know you get to know the person and the person gets to know you and um you know while courting also the pastor has to be involved and at at some point the parents also have to be involved. This is all for you to make a decision. both the young man to make the decision and the young lady to make the decision. So this can take for as long as the decision is not made, as long as you're not sure. But once you are sure and you are sure she's the one, you are sure he's the one. I've seen some, you know, having ced for a while and finally the decision is made and is in the negative. Sometimes the sister, sometimes the brother and then you have to continue with counseling them so that they also qu in a good way, good Christian way. They separate peacefully in a Christian way. Do you see why the pastor is necessary? You don't come to me when you are 100% sure. You come when you think you've seen somebody. Then now you can begin to get cancelled. Some of you want to come when everything is finished. What we need for us. No, we cannot do that because Why you want to involve God at the end not at the beginning? Some of you you start things like I had a brother saying that you eat your frog after it has choked you then you run to the pastor. Pastor help me things are serious. I said but how did you even come I think we should start right below now is finally made having agreed with the parents who were actually there yesterday. Is it yesterday? Where is brother? He hid himself. I was yesterday. Yes. him and a few others went and his father pastor Kadu also was there and they had agreements and I had permission to go ahead initially. We used to have the engagement before that approval from the parents. But we had issues with that cuz you find that now the younger man you you say okay we do the engagement now you go to the parents and then you go to the parents they tell you we want 20 cows and then you you come and tell us pastor I've changed my mind. So yeah that's the truth. So we thought no we have to change it. And it must be parents first you get approval then now engagement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And um then then brother Bham says then comes the engagement and that you find at the altar. You've got to make an engagement before this union can be. [Music] And that's the way it is with the church of Christ. It has to be an engagement with Christ, a pledge, an engagement, a love affair. That's why you heard him speak all those flashy words of love. I believe they're coming from the heart and then after that promises and then the wedding. Uh, brother, do you have, brother, do you have announcements for the dates of the wedding? Not yet. Okay. They'll let us know the announcements for their wedding. But what I know is brother that will be traveling back to uh Dubai and uh then afterwards he will come back and and take his bride. [Music] But I say those of you young men in DVF if you sleep too much you can see what will happen. They will come from Dubai. They will come from America. They will come from everywhere and they will take them. Praise God. We still have them here. Many of them unless if you want me to mention names. But I say what what the Lord has done for Monica, he will do for every one of you sisters. Praise God. Let us have a baby dedication. Um, bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fear of sin. Oh, bring them in. Amen. Bring them in. Amen. and bring the little ones to Jesus. So this is from brother for our son as we prepare for his dedication. His name is Nariahel. [Music] Nariah means the Lord is my light. Light In scripture, Niah was the father of Baruchia, &gt;&gt; Jeremiah's best friend and scribe, which we believe that his path will be guided by wisdom and truth. [Music] Means belonging to God. Numbers 3:24 which we believe that his life and purpose are God's gift and calling together means the Lord is my light and I belong to you. Amen. We pray that he grows up with wisdom, walking in that light and fulfilling God's plan. Amen. Congratulations. Let us congratulate them. Let us pray. [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I will not drop you. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our heavenly father in my hands I have a little bund of joy brother Nariah. Lord, I remember when the mother sister was at that moment and of desperation and I didn't even know the sex of the child and by inspiration I wrote to brother and I told him, "Your son and your wife shall be with Lord. You knew this boy before he was even born. And Lord, I pray your blessing upon him. The Lord, you will be the light in him that you will give him so much wisdom and also you will give him so much protection. Lord, you will be upon him a banner that the enemy will not be able to reach him. I commit him into your hands, Lord. for protection. Lord, even as he grows, Lord, may you give wisdom also to the parents. They will they will raise him in the fear of the Lord and that they will know that this is a duty given to them by God. Lord Jesus, all life comes from you and Lord unto you, we give this life to dedicate it before you because it came from you. And we ask that your angels will be always around about him to protect him and watch him, provide for the parents always spiritual and physical resources that they will be able to raise him in the fear of God. We dedicate into your heart in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's very comfortable in my house. Congratulations. Believers dedicate children. [Music] We do not baptize them. Praise God. Amen. We were supposed to have a second engagement today, but I think we'll push it to next Sunday or whichever whenever they are ready. Also we had announced that on 15th u we are going to have brother Tom Ray but we we had a a misunderstanding on the dates and it will actually be on the 22nd. You already saw that new poster which we posted. So we shall have brother Tom and brother Michael here &gt;&gt; from in Canada. And I pray that none of us miss misses. Try your best to be here. It will be at 5 p.m. Not this next weekend. The other weekend, the other Wednesday 22nd October. We are also going to have several brothers joining us, several pastors from different regions [Music] and um you know um so you who attends here please come on time that we may host those people. If you have a visitor at home and money tells you prayer that we have a visitor tomorrow. That is the moment you behave better. Yes. We have visitors behind [Music] us. We are the hosts and come and be here. Today looks like I have a lot of preliminaries. Also, &gt;&gt; next Sunday we have a couple's only meeting after the church service on in the morning and I know we have several couples here. So um as long as you're married, you're a couple come with your wife, come with your husband, that will be in the afternoon. So that Sunday plan to be here the whole day if you're married. Praise God. And also um we shall have um um a brief meeting with the land fund team leaders, committee members after the service. I think brother Joel forgot to announce that but I want to appreciate all those who are giving towards the land. May the Lord bless you. May the Lord bless you. Let us stand and try to change the order of the service now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'd like us to sing, my redeemer is your faithful and true. [Music] You know at such a moment you know whenever before we go to the word it's always important to connect with the spirit to get out of the flesh enter the spirit and then we are bound to hear from him as long as the spirit is down in our hearts and in his presence. So my desire this morning because I have a burden to share something that is very important I'm praying that we will open our hearts and be focused. He will come and minister to us. My redeemer, you are faithful and true. [Music] Everything that you have said you will do. Every morning your mercies are new. My redeemer, you are faithful and true. Everybody echo your voice. Lift up your hand. Oh my redeemer, you are faithful and true. Do you believe that? Every morning you have said you will do every morning. Oh, your mercies are new. My redeemer, you are faithful and true. Sing it again. My redeemer, you are faithful and true. Oh, everything that you have said, you will do every morning. Your mercies are new, [Music] my redeemer. You are faithful and true. [Applause] Lord Jesus, we sing that because we believe it. Now we ask that you will come and minister to us. Open our hearts, Lord Jesus. Father, if there is somebody here that is needed spiritually, Lord, may you come and minister to them. Provide spiritual food in your season. Anoint me, Lord. Give me strength, Father, to speak your word with boldness and give them grace to receive it also. And Father, Lord, at the end of this service, may we all say our hearts burn within us as he minister to us. We give you the glory in Jesus mighty name. Amen. Amen. Please turn to your Bibles now in the book of Luke chapter 16. I see people who are way way behind. I can't even see some of them. We have some seats. [Music] If brother Martin can bring some people right over here if you want to come and sit in front. I don't know about we're going to Luke 16. Every time I used to be in church when I was a young man, I always desired to be in front so that I hear better and even I receive better from the Lord. If you're not a parent and you don't have a child, you may come in frontier. We are reading from Luke chapter 16. Chapter 16:es 1-9. This is an interesting story. Quite interesting. And I just want you to listen to it as I read it. Amen. If you're reading a Uganda Bible, follow as we read. And he said, he said also unto his disciples, there was a certain rich man, now this is Jesus taking care of the disciples, &gt;&gt; which had a steward, and the same was accused unto him that he that he had wasted his goods. And he called him and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer a steward. Then the steward said within himself, "What shall I do? For my lord taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig to beg. I am ashamed. when I am put out of the stewardship, then may they may receive me into their houses. So he called every one of his lord's dattors unto him, and said unto the first, "How much owest thou unto my lord?" And he said, "And 100 measures of oil." And he said unto him, "Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write 50." Then said he to another, "And and uh how much ost thou?" And he said, "An 100 measures of wheat." And he said unto him, "Take thy bill and write for for score." And the Lord commanded the unjust steward because he had done wisely. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. And I say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the mmon of unrighteousness. Can can you imagine what he said there? &gt;&gt; And I say unto you, make yourselves friends of the mmon of unrighteousness that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I heard a brother giving a testimony um that I think sister Gloria I don't know whether she's here God bless you sister Gloria Gloria I heard that she's she was giving a testimony of a new job also there's a few others who have been testifying of new jobs. Uh, did you testify? &gt;&gt; So, you also got a new job. Um, and you know, a few others and also there are a few others who have got new jobs, but you don't know yet, but they're coming. And I'm not speaking presumptuously. I know. I know. I know what I'm talking about. Um and so I thought that this is the right time to talk on this subject being that there are many who are getting new jobs because I warned you I told you that if you give faithfully the Lord is going to bless you. But you see not all of us know how to handle the blessing. Some of you God has blessed you with jobs. Others God has blessed you with wives, others with husbands, others God has blessed you with children, with families. But you see with all these blessings comes responsibility. And there are many people when they get they begin to see and even that's why the others who are not around today you will find they are not around in church because of the blessings. I said pastor there's the one who told me pastor I'm sorry I'm no longer able to come because I'm so so busy but I stream you know I have this job you know and and another one will you know be now of course we have mobile money so people would send their tithe and they feel as long as I'm sending my t they know I'm around but you see God is not interested in your type God is interested in your soul So whether you are supporting the work of God with money, that's not the thing. The thing is you you as a person, God is interested in you. And so I felt that we needed to address this uh these things. And this sermon is not um well, it's meant to help you to know how to manage the blessing. And I'm going to speak to you on a sacred trust. And when we talk about the blessing, people always think about money. But it's not only that, as we shall see as we go on. So would you pray for me? I mean it. pray for me in your heart that God will help us uh to bring these things to you. And um you know, being a Sunday and we only have one service, please let me not rush through. You know, you can help the preacher preach comfortably and quickly if you give undivided attention. But if you come in, go out, come in, go out, yawn, sleep, the preacher will be obstructed and it will drain the spirit of God. But I want those who will preach with me this morning. Amen. Stay alert. Sit on the edge of your seat and be ready to to grab whatever is yours. Amen. I I the first time I read this scripture many years ago, [Music] I really never understood it. &gt;&gt; But I realized people like I think John Weasley preached on it. Um I think it was John Weasley when he was uh uh preaching on the use of money. That's a wonderful sermon. You need to go and listen to it or rather read it. And he preached on on on he gave three principles said you know make all you can save all you can give all you can there's a very good principles there but I'm not going to go that direction and um this scripture here Jesus was speaking about this unjust steward And you know this man, you know, he was not dealing well with the goods of his master, he was wasting his goods. And so when he was reported to his master and he learned about it, he did not wait for him to be fired so that he can go and dig, so he can go and be ashamed. [Music] Because now he thought to himself, I am not I don't have the ability to dig. I have worked in this office for all these years. I also don't know how to beg. I don't want to bake. You know, there are some people who have no problems with baking. They love baking. They are so lazy. They don't want to work. And so they just always devote themselves to asking for help. Don't misunderstand him. It is okay to get help or to ask for help in certain circumstances. But I'm talking about people who do not want to work or find work, but they are always quick to asking for help. And so this man said, "I cannot beg. I'm ashamed to beg, brother. I have a lot of stereo." And so he says, "I'm ashamed to beg. And also, I cannot dig. So what am I going to do?" So he said I am resolved on what I'm going to do I when I'm put out of the stewardship then I will these people I want them to receive me in their houses the people I have been serving even if I'm no longer the boss I want them to still have relations with me So what did he do? He started on a plan. He called one of the servants, one of the Lord is debtors and he said unto him, "How much do you owe unto my Lord?" Are you hearing me, church? How much do you owe? He said, "1 measures of oil. Yeah. And and so he said, "Okay, it's all right. Come quickly, quickly, quickly. Now you write down. It's no longer 100. It is 50. The 50 I've forgiven you." He went, he brought another one. He said, "How much do you owe?" He said, "100 measures of wheat." He says, "Okay, quickly quickly now write down 80 quickly." Why? Because he was about to be h just away from his work or fired. So he wanted this deal to be done quickly. He said, "Right." And he got another one. Now Jesus commanded this unjust steward. You know, usually when I have brothers, please help me on my voice. Uh, and now it is really looks like I'm it's not really good. If someone can help the brothers, you you know, now look. And the Lord commanded the unjust steward because he had done wisely. And then he said this word &gt;&gt; for the children of this world. &gt;&gt; Jesus is not saying he had done wisely. So you also go and do like that. But he's saying he had done wisely because he was preparing for the future. He was preparing himself for the future. When I am no longer in this responsibility, I want to make sure my future is bright. So he decided to do like how he did. Jesus said wisely or I could even say cunning for and then he says for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. Now he's not saying because for them they fake things and they they they cheat and they do that. So for us we are foolish because we don't do it. [Music] He is saying that the children of this world because for them they are children of this world but we are not children of this world. How many are understanding? For us we came from God we go back to God. That is our true origin. Amen. So our future is not here. Our future is over there. And now Jesus said, "For the children of this world are wiser than the children of light. Think about it. Why? Because they can prepare for their future." Hallelujah. But the children of life, we don't know how to prepare for our future. We don't know how to use stewardship well. And then he gave us Oh, praise God. I'm telling you, you're going to love this because I loved it as I was studying. Amen. Vers. And then he said, I say unto you, make to yourselves Friends of the M of unrighteousness. [Music] Praise God. This is what this man did. He made himself a future using money. He reduced the debt of the debtors and that way he made his future bright. Now the Bible is saying we as children of life. You know we also have a future. So we should make ourselves friends of the m of unrighteous. Well of course the bible says we cannot serve two masters. We cannot serve God and Mmon, but we should make ourselves friends with the M of unrighteousness. Praise God. After you have made all you can, how are you using it? Use it for your future. Whatever substance you have in your hand, Use it for the kingdom. Use it for your future life. Because when this life is over, what will you be remembered for? Hallelujah. What did you do for the Lord? What did how much investment did you make? &gt;&gt; Praise God. So that when you fail, This is your future. They will receive you into everlasting habitation. No, no, no, no. Well, you've used your resources, right? After life fails, after you die, after you leave this earth, Then you will be received &gt;&gt; into everlasting habitations into eternal life. Then you'll receive eternal life. Now what is a sacred trust? uh the meaning of this word you know by dictionary it means I'll just read for you the meaning a trust is a legal arrangement where a person or entity [Music] which you can call now the trustee holds assets for the benefit of another person [Music] or a group or which is now what what we can call the beneficiary. [Music] The the beneficiary according to the instructions of the person who established the trust. Now trusts are used for various purposes including asset protection, estate planning, providing for dependence and managing wealth for future generations. Praise God. So what we call a trust, if you are a trustee, you have been given a a trust, &gt;&gt; you've been given assets or you've been given resources. These are not yours. They for somebody else, but you've been entrusted to use them for the bene for the benefit of the owner. Now a sac trust is not something given something given. It is something entrusted for divine purpose. everything God places in your hand. But you may say, "What is a secret trust?" So what is it that we have as a trust? Me, I'm not even rich. I'm not even uh so I don't have I'm not a trustee. You know, in the church, we have trustees. A trustee when they keeping church money, it is not theirs to spend, but they are entrusted to you to to um to use it according to the owner. Are you following me so far? Now, but what is what is the trust that you have? Ask your neighbor, what is the trust that you have? Praise God. Each of us here, I'm not preaching a sermon from the moon. I'm talking about things that we are already experiencing. Each of us here is a trustee. You you are a trustee in your different capacity. You are a trustee. Okay? Are you following me? So now everything that God places in your hands, you have it in your hands. So what do you have? Regardless of your age, regardless of your responsibility, To some of you, maybe you are entrusted with a spouse, you know, like a wife or a husband. You know, to some of you, you are entrusted with a child, a job. Okay, we have had many others getting jobs, jobs, a talent. You know, you cannot make someone a trustee unless you trust them. Praise God. He that is faithful in little is also faithful in much. Some of you, you know, I was telling a brother that, you know, we should always have a heart that is void of competition. You don't need to compete with anyone. Whatever is yours is yours. Are you following me? No one can take your place. No one can ever take your place in the church family, in the home family, whatever, at workplace, in the society. Some people say, "Oh, they bewitched me and I lost my job." I do not believe in that. If you are a child of God, whatever you have has been given to you by God and no man can take it out. The Bible says he opens the door and no man can shut. He shuts and no man can open. Regardless of how many connections you have, you can't get that job unless God has opened it. But why is it not opening door for some of you? Because you are not trust worthy [Music] yet. And God is waiting on you. He's watching you. He's watching your life. How is he watching you with that trust which has been given to you? Because he the principle is He that is faithful in little is also faithful in much. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a testimony and I'm so sorry brother and and your wife. I'm so sorry. I'm have to say this. You know this brother and his wife are teachers, professional teachers. It's been very difficult with get them getting jobs you know because of ABCD but here I told them as a revelation brother came here we prayed with them and um and I told him brother you see because I noticed talked to his team leader because there were no good job therefore there was no good inflow within their land fund All right. I think it was the sister. Where is the sister? &gt;&gt; Yeah. She was putting in something. She was more faithful than him. And so because he did not have what to put. And so I told him, see, you have to excuse me. I'm giving this for your benefit. miners will not be bigarted. And so I told him, brother, look what you have to do. I don't know what I had preached that day and they were inspired about it. And he told me, you know, we have made a commitment. We are going to begin faithfully giving to landfarm. Whether we have or we don't have, who is the team leader? Okay. How many weeks ago is that? Sorry, seven seven weeks only. I was shocked when brother Martin the team lead of their group where the brother is he told me he's now beginning to put seriously he's not missing any week. I said all right let him now wait and see what will happen. Shortly after that, his wife got a job. [Music] Not a small one, a good one. Shortly after that, he also got a got a job. Now, friends, you might you might think, well, I don't know how long they stay without a job. But I can tell you this is not an act of man. These are principles of the word. If you are faithful in little, you. God will give you the big because he has already seen your faithfulness to be a trustee. [Music] He tests you in the small. I've had many people who say, "Oh, when I become rich, we do things of collecting collecting. I'll just buy the church now. I'll just build for them." But when you find out how much are you giving now, nothing. &gt;&gt; Forget it. &gt;&gt; Even when you get the big money you are dreaming about, &gt;&gt; you cannot you will use it for what you're using it for now. However, you are spending your little resources now is how you will spend the big resources when they come. And God looks at you and he tests you with the little things he gives you. and he watches how you will behave with him. What's your priority? &gt;&gt; What are you looking at? Praise God. Oh, I can't go to church because I have no transport. Oh, okay. You need transport. Oh, if God gives me a car, I need a car. I will be the first every service. No, God knows you will not even be there. Because now that you have a car and you had many things making you busy, you will now become more busier. That's when your uncle, your brother, your friend, your whatever is come and we go together for whatever you will go. You will just be going. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you have a car because in your heart Your priority is not serving God. The Bible says God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man saw it that shall you also reap. Amen. Praise God. So friends, I want us to understand there is something about stewardship. When God gives you a trust, and each of us has a trust, however little it might be, but you see, he's expecting that it will be multiplied. He's expecting you will use it well. No man has ever spent time with God and got nothing out of it. No man has ever invested in the work of God and became a failure. If you're looking for areas to invest in, well, I can tell you can invest in many projects and they will always fail without God. But if you invest in the work of God, in the things of God, in the children of God, in the gospel, in the message, let me tell you, you can never be a failure. Because for you to become a failure, it means God has failed you. And God has never failed and will never fail anyone. Amen. So now a sacras can be anything. It can be a wife God has given you. It can be a a husband God has given you. You know, it can be a child God has given to you. It's a sacred trust. You know, a job God has given to you. You know that job is just an assignment. It's just a beginning. Whatever any of you has as a job, it is not a job. It is a test. It's a test of stewardship. It's a test of faithfulness. I tell you what, brother, sister. Hallelujah. When you are faithful, God will give you another one. Amen. Amen. And another one. And another one. pray for me because there are many things I want to say and I I want to use my time well. He he can give you a talent, a talent, a gift, you know, maybe a ministry and something you are doing for the Lord. You know, some of you can give you influence. [Music] Do you know there are some good influencers? Praise God. &gt;&gt; There's a young man who had, you know, he was, and I don't encourage you young people to use Tik Tok or some of these, [Music] but there one who had a big following when he was not a believer yet. And you know, so so when one brother saw it, he told him, "Why are you not using your account?" He said, "No, I left those things because I believed." Brother, you are not getting the idea. You are an influencer. Use the platform to spread the message. Some of you, God has given you influence. When you speak, people follow you. Some people believe you. And some of you use that influence for gossip. breaking friendships and families. Use that influence knowing it is a trust God has put in your hand. It's not your own. Whatever you have is not yours. It's a property on loan. Praise God. Amen. And there is no one here can say I have nothing. Every one of us has something. You go in the Bible and check. When God came to Moses, he asked him, "What do you have?" He had something. Praise his God. Amen. When you go in the Bible, you find Elisha. He came to the woman who was praying and crying. Oh, I have nothing. I am a poor widow. My husband is dead. He was a servant of God. Say, stop crying about what you have lost. And the prophet asked her a question. What do you have? And she said, I have a little cruise of oil. Say that will be enough. Let me tell you, whatever you have. Whatever you need, you have. Because whatever you need to come out of what you have and you know you know this prophet Elijah came to another woman I think we of Zerapath and Asa what do you have said give me something to drink he said no I've got to bring water say no wait bring al something to eat I don't have food for I only have for me and my son for one time and we die. In other words, I have no food. He said, you you think what you have is for you, but but the idea was if you use what you have for you, if you think it is yours to consume, you will consume it and die. I can't give to land fund. I can't give offering. I can't give ti. I can't because I don't have enough. None has enough. No one ever has enough. Brother, sister, read your Bible very well. People that God used to do mighty things. They began with something small but they had faith in the unseen. Amen. You talk about that woman. You know the prophet told her don't explain to me stories. Just give me what I'm saying. And that's what God is saying. What you have is not yours. What you have you have it as a trustee. is given to you to use for his glory. Your job is not yours. &gt;&gt; Your wife is not yours. Your husband is not yours. Your child is not yours. Your gift is not yours. Your ministry, whatever, it's not yours. Your money is not yours. Whatever you have, Amen. is for the Lord to receive glory. But the question is, will you receive the revelation? because you can Oh, hallelujah. You cannot go to the next step. The next phase will not come for you until you receive the revelation of what I have is not mine. It is for the Lord is glory. So, let me serve the Lord and I will live by faith. If I die, I die. I have no transport to church. &gt;&gt; Let me walk. If I die, I die. Some of us, there was a time we would walk to church, praying and believing that we will find some money on the ground. Maybe you have never experienced that. But some of us experience it. You are walking 60 kilome 6 km and the dust that is a dusty road. But you are believing you even pray before you start the journey. God open a door at least let me pick 5,000 or something so I can have money for border &gt;&gt; and for offering. You are even not asking God to give you money for you to enjoy. You are asking for him to give you money to serve him. And I tell you, God is has a sense of humor. You know, he would take you through that and you know what money would come. You're walking and you know you don't walk looking up. You walk looking down. But adventure you may miss to see the money experiences. You understand what I'm talking about and you are walking looking down. One time I didn't have transport and I said prayed to God will provide. I don't want to miss the service. &gt;&gt; So by faith I prepared myself got my Bible started walking with my neck tie and everything. Of course, when a car passes you become baptized in dust, &gt;&gt; but he said it's all right. After all, I know I was smart, but it's the dust. And then I I prayed for 5,000. I picked 50,000. Now, of course, the the non-believers are telling me now it's not your money. You have picked it. You have to take it to police. Come on. [Music] My friend, the God of Peter is my Peter. He's my God. The God who told him, "Go open the first fish's mouth. remove money from the mouth of the fish. He picked the money. God threw it there. You're talking about what? I'm talking about faith and you would pay your tithe and you will use for transport for several days. Transport. Praise God. I'm talking about faithfulness and and having this understanding. What I have is not mine. &gt;&gt; What do you have? Say I have nothing. No, you don't have nothing. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them you don't have nothing. So what do you have? Maybe you have your two feet. There is someone who can't walk but you you can walk. So maybe you have that. Begin with that and the Lord will see you and will see your faithfulness. And when you go back again, he will power more. He will power more. He'll power more. And before you know it, you the Bible says they ate for many days. Serving God will never make you lose. Giving to the Lord will never make you lose. It will make you prosper. [Applause] Amen. Whatever you have is a property on loan. 1 Timothy 6:20, Paul tells Timothy, "Keep that which is committed to thy trust." Gifts and calling and the calling of God are without repentance. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; God has given you something even by birth, not because you pleased him. So what do you have? Some of you you have some wisdom of and the ability of doing certain things but you can't bring it to the work of God. Why bring your wisdom? God has given it to you. Some of you are gifted. Some of you sisters and brothers, you are gifted. If you have something like a youth camp, what can you do? What can you bring to the table? Make yourself a useful member of the body of Christ. But some believers, they're very doant. They will never do anything. Never do anything. There's a problem. And that's why you remain stagnant. All the time you're sorry for yourself, brothers. Time to be sorry for yourself is over. Come on another level. Come higher. Amen. Increase your revelation to a place for where you will understand. I have something I can do. Hallelujah. He said, therefore, a certain noble man went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom. and then to return. And he called his 10 servants and delivered unto them£10 and said unto them, "Occupy till I come. Occupy till I come." Whatever he has given you is not yours to own but it is to glorify himself through you through that. Praise God. Whatever he has given you. I feel like some people are not getting it. Come out of the canality. Come to a spiritual level of understanding. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever God has given you, whatever is not yours to own, [Music] it is for you to glorify God through that thing. Your carmen, your bicycle, your motorcycle, your wife, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your husband, your child, your job. Are you hearing me? Whatever you have is not yours. It is for God's glory. But it comes by revelation. One time God comes to a man called Abraham and he tells him, "Abi man, give me your ch your son. Give me your son. Let us be sincere. How many of you can give out your children? It is the only son you have." God has a a sense of humor. He always comes to ask you for the only little thing you can grew yourself on it you want change. Am I sharing the word? But when you give it not okay okay okay okay no no no God loves a cheerful all right God how many can do that many of us we can't okay but Abraham was not sad. You read the Bible very well. When God told him, "Give me your son." Abraham quickly understood this boy come from God. Amen. Is not mine is for God, God promised me to have a long generation. I don't know how he will do it. But what I know, he promised me he will do it. Therefore, whatever he has given me, I am happy to give it back to you. That's why no matter what Abraham did, God told God said Abraham had faith, Abraham staggered not staggered not but didn't stagger. He really staggered when he went with you know what is the name of that woman? Why did he go back to God again when God had told him it is with Sarah and Sarah suggested let's do this Abraham maybe it is through my maiden God meant he said okay God what what he said do what your wife said why didn't he ask God to begin He knew it was wrong. He knew what the word said. But you know what? When you do, there's something that you can do. God will forget everything else you have done. You know, God saw only one thing that when it came to the son of promise, Abraham did not stagger in him. He believed this child is from God. Therefore, if God wants the child, I'm willing and ready to give this child. He staggered not. And that's what is written about Abraham. Brother Henry, then time comes when he was going to take this chance child for sacrifice. I want you to watch. This is what we call revelation. By faith, Abraham, by revelation, Abraham, papa, we have the fire. But where is the sacrifice? Who remembers what Abraham said? What did he say? God, everybody say it. God will provide for himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Abraham right there. He created a sacrifice. He created by his action. He created by his words. He created by his faith. And God is always faithful to those who are faithful. When he he went to kill his son, God told him, Abraham, don't do it. And then there was a ship. &gt;&gt; And then there was a ship. Some of you, you are giving your best to the Lord. You are you are giving yourself to the Lord unreservedly. You know, it may not be all of you, but some of you for sure. I have a word for you this morning. Hallelujah. If you're giving yourself to the Lord and reserve, he will provide a sacrifice. He will provide what you never expected. Expect surprising. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. God is going to surprise some of you. I said God is going to surprise some of you. God is going to surprise some of you because God has a way of doing more than we expected, abundantly, exceeding our thoughts, exceeding our ideas. That is what our God does. Someone help me to say hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You are not your own. [Music] In the Queen of the South, Brother Bam says, "If God has given you the message of speaking with tongues, [Music] you have to help me and preach this, brother." Cuz I don't want an interpreter. I want a fellow preacher this morning cuz I have a lot. I told you I have a lot. If God has given you the message of speaking with tongues, do it. If God has put in your hands to interpret, do it. Praise God. If God has put in your hands to testify, come on church, do it. If God is put in your hands to preach, &gt;&gt; preach what you've got. Let go. [Music] Hallelujah. What you've got, let go. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember some years ago I think it's now years one person came and told me pastor I always feel like speaking in tong and then I hold it. I said come on let go. And here is what our prophet said. If you if God has given you in your heart speak in tong let go your amens are small. Are you Roman Catholics? Are you Baptist? Baptist? &gt;&gt; Do you believe in speaking in tongues? If God has put you to speak in tones, let go. If God has given you interpreting, let go. Let go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of God is, there is liberty. If God put in your hand to testify, testify. Let God do it. If God has put in your hands to preach, pray. Whatever you've got, let go. Tell your neighbor, "Let go." Come on. Tell them, "Let go. Let go. Oh, glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If God has put money in your hands, let go. If God has put a job, whatever it is, let go for his glory. as I said last evening. How dare men or women, you have no right to do those things. You are you are bought. You are bought. [Music] You are not your own. But you are bought with the price of the precious blood of Jesus. And you are not your own. [Music] to throw your life away and to live the way you do. You have no right to live the way you want. You are not your own. You have an owner. Even your life, you are just a trustee. You are just keeping it for somebody. Somebody the owner. Amen. Who is the owner? The one who gave it. You are a trustee of your life. You have no right to live the way you want. You were bought with the precious blood of Jesus and you are not your own. Praise God. You have no legal rights to take that life that Christ has bought and sell it to the devil. You have no rights to do it. And as I said, that thirsting, that thirst that you're feeling. God made you with that thirst. That's a part of God. God is make up for you. He made you and give you a thirst, a thirst for him. But but then listen. He says, "But you try to satisfy that thirst with worldly amusement. You see, dancing drinking, smoking, gambling, lrying to satisfy that blessed holy fast with the things of the world. And listen, he says, you have no right to do it. And you are cheating and robbing God by doing so. Younger people who are here, you have no right going to those dances. You are not your own. As long as you are a bloodboat child of God, you even have no right going to those dance clubs and those beer parties. Philistine kind of dances. &gt;&gt; You also go there and begin you have bad such a bad trusting [Music] you see drinking, smoking, gambling last you you don't have a right. So the ones who say I have a right to do what I want. It's my body even &gt;&gt; because the devil owns their bodies and their spirit and their soul. But the devil never bought it. So they own it. They're just floating everywhere. They have no place overboard. But to a son of God, to a daughter of God, someone purchas [Music] someone. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I said I'm someone who someone. So when the devil come to fight against me, I will always tell him you don't know what you are fighting with. Because I have someone that paid and bowed me. I don't own myself. If you are against me, you against him. He's the owner of everything I have. Everything I am. It is for his glory. I am someone. That's why there are certain things we cannot do. Why? Not because we can't do it but because we are cognizant of this fact that we are trustees. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now let me let me quickly now take you through the different life seasons of of of stewardship. Life seasons of stewardship. Praise God. Can you open Ephesians 5:25? Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church, and he gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spinkle, or any such thing, but that he should be holy and without blemish. men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it and given as unto the Lord the church. For we are the members of his body, of his flesh, of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery. But I speak concerning Christ and the child. Marriage is not ownership. I don't I don't want anyone to miss this. So if you I'm going to call your name. Marriage is not ownership. It's a secret trust. You see in Africa here we thought that marriage is ownership. You know that's why men usually beat their wives with with with rods they beat children and even the mother whatever the wife does that kind of behavior it's like as if you a true bornagain believer will not follow these cultural things of saying I want 10 cows 20 cows. Please I'm preaching this for my generation. Don't tell your fathers I said this. This is for you and your children. If you're truly born again, you are not going to begin saying a young man who is filled with the Holy Ghost, I want 50 cows, 20 cows, 30. No, they are not buying your daughter. Why? Because she doesn't belong to you. Someone gave her to you as a steward for you to raise her in the fear of God until she finds a God-given husband. When the husband comes, he's not the owner too. Amen. Who is the owner? The one who bought her with a price. Praise God. That's why he came and died. But no man can physically die for his wife. But he died for his bride. And when he did, he did for all of us. So no one owns anybody. Your wife. Wait. Wait. The mentality that she's my daughter. I own her. [Music] Therefore, they must pay me 50 cows. Is the reason why men in Africa beat their wives? Because they also feel their own heart. Do you know how much I bought? Do you know how much I suffered? Do you know what I paid? But you brothers, when your children grow, your daughters and then you get them to get married, you are cognizant of the fact you are just a steward. You you you don't need any payment. If this young man wants to appreciate you for raising a well, if he's wise enough, he will do it. Praise God. And when he takes her, he doesn't own her. That is why men who don't understand. They have a lot of rules and regulations. They will put laws and oppress and the woman cannot say anything. She doesn't because she's a woman in Christ neither male nor female. We are all owned by him equally. We are all I am sorry if your traditions are bigger than the word. But I'm preaching the word this morning. Praise God. Tradition has its place and I have I'm not against it at all. I'm not against it. Praise God. I paid my bride price. I paid my bride price. It was a requirement of the fathers. But I have a revelation. Even the other time I had the revelation. She doesn't belong to me. &gt;&gt; She belongs to the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; So marriage is a secret trust. God puts a wife or a husband in your hand to see if you can reflect Christ and the church. Faithful stewardship in marriage is expressed in the atmosphere you build in your home. The atmosphere of prayer, the atmosphere of respect, mutual respect. [Music] unity. The husband is doing this, the wife is doing it. The home is divided, that home has no Christ. But a home that has Christ is always united in Christ. If you are both in Christ, you will be united. He say you don't own your spouse. You are just and you are accountable for how you represent Christ to your to your spouse. [Music] Praise God. How do you represent Christ to your wife? How do you represent Christ to your husband? Did you know that these things are this deep or you thought it's just marriage? Genesis 18. I wish I had time. I would go on and talk more about carry on. And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that that thing which I which I do, seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. For I know him that he will command his children, and he is a household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord." Now let me read it again. If you have children, listen carefully. I said listen carefully. This is what God thinks about Abraham. Can I hide anything from Abraham? For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him. after him. He will command them to be like him and they shall keep the way of the Lord. I don't know about you, brother, sister, but I want God to say this about you. I know I know him very well. He will raise his children the way of the Lord. Come on now. I know. I know. I want you should desire God to speak your name like that. I know him. Why? Because he's a good steward. Amen. Why those children are given to you? Because God has trusted you to raise them well. But many believers begin to put cartoons for their children. Cartoons that are completely way off. Take time to watch what your children are watching. See what they're feeding on. &gt;&gt; 3 years they're feeding on love stories. What seed are they eating? You a father, a mother, you're doing that. How can God trust you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what Christian parenthood is. Watch what your children are feeding on. Watch the the children they playing with. Watch the games they playing. It's not control. It is stewardship. The neighbors are nonbelievers. &gt;&gt; The neighbors watch B. Before you know it, your children will come backing back. One time I went with my daughter to one of the Indian, you know, homes and before I knew it, children, let me tell you, they are so fast. They will reach where you will not reach in a moment. Just in a minute I was speaking with this Indian where what is she worshiping? She was I think about four five years. So I looked and she was in a small shrine of their small god and you know there was this woman there worshiping the the idols with some fire and smoke and incense and everything and idols and So I found her there said so she she was telling her also to sit and you know also you know join inh I said not my child come out that's how parents have to be watch out for your children it is it is a right God has given to you I expected mothers and fathers to shout amen That's why a believer's home is not supposed to be like the worldly homes where TV raises the children. DVF, help me to preach this message now and you are putting TV because you don't want children to disturb you and they are watching their morning to evening. You don't even know what they watch in the home of a believer. TV should never raise children. Watch what you you you are you are you are a steward. You as a parent. You you are given this sacred trust of these children. And you are supposed to raise them in the fear of God, in the way of the Lord, in the way of the word. Praise God. Malachi 2:15. And did not he make one, yet had the residue of the spirit and wherefore one, that he might seek a godly seed. [Music] Praise God. Adam and Eve and the purpose was that he will have a godly seed. When God looks at marriage, God looks at a godly seed. &gt;&gt; Look at it this way. If you marry an unbeliever, you entangle. You are yoking yourself with two you are two equal unequal powers yoking yourself. You can never raise a godly seed. But you see God wants you to marry a believer that you may raise a godly seed. Train up a child in the way he should go. when he is old, he will not depart from me. We have a married couple meeting next weekend or there are certain things that I I will reserve and speak then I think. Yeah, next weekend on on in the afternoon. So praying that just I'll spare you some of it and then I speak it then. But you see it is a sacred trust that a parent has. to raise a godly seed, to train up a child in the way he should go. Praise God. You see, if you look at Colossians 3, it says, "And whatsoever you do, do it heartly as unto the Lord and not unto men, and knowing that of the of the Lord shall ye receive the reward of the inheritance. I'm looking at stewards of influence and provision. If stewards of influence, stewards of provision, whatever you have, you see um the Lord, whatever you are doing as a job or whatever, remember you are serving the Lord. You see, every coin a believer earns is a testimony. And if you know that then that's why you give offering, that's why you pay your 10%. That's why we help others, not because we have a lot. All flows from understanding stewardship. By the way, let me tell you, it is easy for a person who has to give. [Music] But how did they get? I'm talking about a believer now. How did he get? By giving when he did not have. [Music] by revelation. It is stewardship to understand the little that I have. I give by sacrifice because even God himself, he gave everything he had. He loved the world that he gave. Whenever you love, you give. If you love the Lord with all your heart, you give him everything you have. When God increases you, it is a test so that to see if he can trust you with all the kingdom resources. The church must learn that the increase is for go the kingdom purpose. When God opens income doors for you, he watches you how you will handle what he belongs to him. How you talk, how you dress, how you behave at work, at home. It testifies of your stewardship. The Holy Ghost is not only to speak in tongues, but is to produce fruit to represent the owner. Our conduct is in society either draws souls or pushes them away. Each area is a sacred trust. You know, meant to express Christ's character, not listen. Oh God, help us. It is not meant to bring you personal success. It is meant to express the character of Christ. [Music] There are some people when you get something. You want to show everybody how successful you are because you bought a car. You will begin waving the key everywhere. Why? You know, I remember there was a time when cell phones had just started and mom must be remembering that man who used to pass around home and there used to be a neighborhood like he was maybe in his mid20s. And so he had this, you know, small phone. We used to call them block phones, &gt;&gt; you know, block phones. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, he would be passing by home and you know, of course, everybody's on the ver and they seated. So he will remove the block of phone. Hey, no one is calling him. He's just trying to show that he has a phone. And we the little ones we shall also have a phone. So if you have a job or something good and you make believers feel like that, you are a bad steward. It's not to show your success. It is to show Christ's character. &gt;&gt; Your job is not your destiny. It is your assignment. You have an assignment. Today you have this one. Tomorrow you're getting another one. I don't know about you, but for me, I want to be assigned from glory to glory to glory to glory to glory. the position you are in today, someone is praying for it. Therefore, for God to answer their prayer, he will have to remove you. But where you will go will be determined by your character and your understanding and revelation of stewardship. If you are proud, he will bring you back down and the other person will take the pain. But if you are humble, he will have to upgrade you. Some of you are going to get promotion. Not because you prayed but because someone else is praying. So for God to answer their prayers, he will have to remove you from that place and promote you there, promote them there so he can put you in another higher place. You know it's a body being blessed. Your family is not your possession. Some my wife, my family, my children, my my my is not yours. It is your stewardship. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am determined friends. I got determined that I will serve the Lord, my wife will serve the Lord, my children will serve the Lord. And I tell you what, even when it comes to overnight, many times if I'm so weak or maybe sickly or tired or whatever and I I said I I just said tell my wife, I will not go today. Oh yes, I go through that sometimes. Every human being does. Said, dear, I will not go today. She said, it's all right. I understand. But then she begins to push me slowly but wisely. Now you're going to remain here. Demons may attack you. Let us go. And then she prepares herself. Everybody's going out. Are you sure you are not going? You are not going to enjoy here. And when it happens that she's the one who is weak especially when she's expecting those are weak moments. So I'm always the strong one also said are you sure you're going to remain I fear for you because for us we are going in the house of so is it with our children for those ones we are not even begging them. If it's time for church, it's time for everyone to go to church. Never let your children set their rules in your home. As long as they are in your house, you have a God-given responsibility like Abraham to make sure they serving God. You see, let me tell you, you read the book of Job. The Bible tells me that Job when things happened, he decided, you know, the Bible says he was always sacrificing for himself and his children. Is that true? Same thing with with others that we read of in the Bible, they always sacrificed for themselves and their children. That's why when it comes to the land fund of the church, I see a few families that do that. God bless you for doing that. I'm one of those. And you know, they pledged something for themselves and pledged for their children. Each of them &gt;&gt; because it is now your responsibility to bring them in the will of the Lord and they know me I give this much. I give this much. When it comes time for offerings, train them. Say don't go to God without an offering. Do you know some believers here don't know that if you read this Bible, it's not allowed to worship God without an offering. You read the Bible very well. There must be a sacrifice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when you come to church, come with your sacrifice and and teach the children to give their sacrifice. Everything in your hand is on God's lawn for his purpose. So I'm not I'm not here to fulfill my purpose, but to fulfill his purpose. We have time and give me about I know I'm a little over time 20 minutes I'll be done. Ephesians 5. Seeing then that ye walk circumspect circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil and we realize that we are at the end time. Nothing can go much longer. We are just wait. We are just waiting in borrowed time like it was in the days of Noah in the long suffering of God when the ark was being prepared only eight souls we are saved. So even as we don't have much time we are living on borrowed time. Tell your neighbor borrowed time. Borrowed time. And the Bible says while we are leaving we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is. So we are not in leisure. We are in harvest time. Every minute is accountable before God. Did you know some of us prostitute our time? We prostitute it. You go and begin scrolling. Social media is killing our generation. You may not want to say amen, but you know it is the truth and it is suffocating some of you. [Music] begin scrolling. You begin at 1 p.m. Before you know it, it is 3 p.m. [Music] The devil just treated you. Every minute you spend is accountable before God. God doesn't waste time. He expects fruit in every tree he has planted. You remember what what happened in the Bible in Luke Luke 13. He said, "Cut down this tree." Because when he plants a tree, he expects fruit. Time management is spiritual warfare. [Music] The devil or you know what is in the business of keeping believers busy busy busy busy with the wrong things. Come on church spend time with God and I'm preaching to myself too. Let us fight this battle. Let us come to church when we have we can fight the battle. Let the devil fight you while you are fighting back because remember you are a steward. You are going to be asked how you use your time. You know I may stand here and preach to you and you feel like I'm taking your time. But I tell you there is coming a day when whatever you think you are going to do out there will not matter anymore. And you will desire to spend one minute in the presence of God before the rapture. But time will be no more. And let me tell you, it is coming to the closing moment and time is coming when the rapture has happened and all of you were joking around, you will remain behind. Do you know remaining behind when you know what has happened? [Music] &gt;&gt; You will come and will tell you where is the pastor? What is it brother? &gt;&gt; Who should I call sincure has happened now? You will be swallowing your tears. But I tell you that preach for me for 3 hours. But you could not even get him for one minute. If you can still sit down and listen to the word rather listen to the word with joy because you have been given this time &gt;&gt; as a steward time. Time stewardship is a very important now on Wednesday because if I go in that area I'm not going to finish now. [Music] I was going to go into uh the sacred virtues that also God has given to a woman and we will talk about that on Wednesday. But I want to finish with a certain quote in the invisible union of the bride of Christ. It says that we are given a sacred virtue [Music] to stay virgin to the word as a woman is to stay virtuous to her husband. It's a sacred trust to honor to honor her Lord's word. We the church, we are given to honor the Lord's word above every man made clean. Above every wisdom denominations, the church is given that trust. Now we have a sacred trust, [Music] an inheritance, a heritage that we inherit as believing children. It is a sacred trust. And that sac trust and our sacred heritage is the word of God that's been given to us. The full word of God. The word itself is the vitamin. The word itself is God's word. And I say it is our privilege. Amen. I'm so glad. I am not just seated somewhere, you know, praying Hail Mary and counting, you know, certain beads. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad, you know, I'm not bowing before an image somewhere. I am so glad. I'm a believer of the full word of God. You know, we used to sing a song. I'm so glad he brought me out. Amen. Where did he bring me from? In sin, he brought me out. Where did he bring me out of? He brought me out of marry. &gt;&gt; He brought me out of denominationalism. You know, we talked about religion last time and how it is one of the greatest enemies and some people are trying to make religion even with this message. But this is beyond and organized religion. It is the life of Jesus Christ and it's a sacred and that sacred heritage is ours. God gave his word to his church and that sacred heritage is ours. It is a gift from God and we will not compromise on it and cut this out and throw this out and add this in. to suit our own twist. But we will preach the full word. Can I have here the preacher saying amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. We will preach the full word, the whole gospel. We are duty bound as Christians to take it and believe it. You know the message teaches a lot of things. that the denominations don't believe in when I first came into this message. I had too many question you know why why are they saying this why this what about the others are they going to hell many questions but as I continue to study the word with the with the understanding of the message I understood it is something special that has been given only to a few &gt;&gt; the minority One time Peter said to Jesus, "Why do you speak to these people in parables?" He said, "It is given to you to understand the mysteries of the kingdom." But to them is not given. Even today that those two groups are here. some who are not given to understand the mysteries of and to some who are given to understand when you talk about water baptism in the name of Jesus you will say amen but there are some people who will say no we don't understand it when you talk about one God and you say Jesus is God in flesh you will say amen but the denominations will say we are confused about We believe the trinity. When you say women are not supposed to be pastors, bishops and you know all these kind of things, they would say you you are you are you know trying to se segregate but to you it's not about segregation it's about the word. You know we are word believers, Bible believers. That's the message of Yahw message believers. The message is Christ. It's not a denomination. It is Christ. And that my friend is a sac trust. It has been given to us. We are supposed to protect it. We are the guardians of this mystery. We are the guardians of the message. Praise God. And if the devil thinks that the message is not right, Christ never died, never rose again, is not here, we are the proof. I am the proof. I preached to some young people and they said, pastor, it is very difficult to live a Christian life. And I said, well, there are some people who are living a Christian life. [Music] Said I'm one of them. That means you too can live a Christian life. You too can overcome this word. Why? Because we are given this word as a sacred trust. Praise God.

Father, intervene and let testimonies flow day by day in the name of our Lord Jesus we pray. Amen. [Music] The Lord bless you. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them, "God bless you. Thank you for coming to the house of God. [Music] We are we are going to to ask the uh the team leaders to please remain shortly. We're just going to be maybe like maximum 20 minutes member leaders. The one for the land land fund. We have to those of you who do not did not know we have seven groups and we have seven members, seven brethren that lead each of one that leads each of those groups and every one year is expected to be in one of those where we collect little by little throughout the week. and uh on a Sunday on the Sunday what was announced is collected throughout the week. Brother, can I have that file? Brother, there's something I just want to mention before we go. I heard brother Joel reading. Thank you. Thank you, brother Joel. Hard him reading the report this morning. &gt;&gt; And um it's important for us to understand our goals and you know no one is going to buy this land for us. No one is going to build the church for us. But the Lord &gt;&gt; and the Lord is going to use the way God works is he blesses us to be able to do it. When we were starting this project, we had about 15 or 20 people who were contributing and in four years. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And you know that man that money was from our offerings. &gt;&gt; And I I would want to say we have come too far to look back. We are more than we were then. And uh the people who have been giving for all those four years for sure you can look back and see how also God has been faithful to you. So let's also be faithful. Um so much of this money that we are looking for now the difference is that much of this money is now pledged. I think we've pledged. Brother D, you know the total? A total of how how much? 10 and what? Who knows the total? Huh? But you give me an estimate like an estimate. I'm sure you must remember like an estimate. You have the laptop here. Yeah. Check and let us inform the people. Much of this money is really pledged about because we are looking for 20 million which is the the the last phase of the purchase of this land. But the way we are paying this is in phases. I think it's about four phases. So the second phase has four phases and each phase we are expected to pay 30 millions. We are given an allowance of 12 months and that was a miracle. So and the the the the 12 months were divided into three months. four times. Three months, three months, three months, three months. So each three months we are supposed to pay 30 million. That's what we are supposed to pay. So the this first section of three months is ending um I think after next Sunday. So we have two week weeks to pay 30 millions. So so far in 10 weeks we've collected 13.6 millions and I heard the brother telling you how much more you need to gather. What the purpose for this report is for you to get the big picture so that you do not be oblivious to these things. We are remaining with 16.4 million people. So we we are remaining with more than what we what we [Music] would have done it &gt;&gt; already by now even in seven weeks if each of us would have been like every one of us not in the amount we are giving but in the commitment I had the treasurer Let's say some of you have jobs meaning you have income as however small it might be. So surely within a week you cannot fail to give something. Now there are some people who don't have jobs and they want to do something. I'll tell you what they have been doing. They've been calling on their friends who have jobs, may not be from this church, may not even be believers. We just tell them we are trying to do fundraising at our church and we need support. Never be ashamed to ask for the Lord. Me, I'm always shy to ask for my personal needs. I've never told you here publicly of any personal need. But when it comes to the for the work of God, I'm never ashamed. So, and some believers here, have been talking to their friends and their friends have been helping. I'll give you an example. Where is the team leader for William Brham? Is she in? She's out. Can the deacons help me? I wanted to give you that little example there. [Music] And you find that many of these people giving a lot of money here don't even earn much. or don't even have anything but they are bringing their friends to help them. Now I'm seeing Colomba giving a lot of money and used to be one of the groups which were down giving 65 but you see the efforts that they have put in there. It shows that the team leader is really committed and the people are committed within that group. And if you ask I I did not get the report for Ka so that's why I do not know but if you ask you find that there are other they are collecting other people and they supporting them. [Music] It's a revelation brethren. Then lastly, the other thing that is helping the groups that are making more money every week is those who pledged are faithfully paying their pledge. You see we have pledged 113 million [Music] but only 13 is only 13 point something is paid. So we remaining with more than 100 pledged. So what does this mean? There are many brethren you see now for example John Wizzley &gt;&gt; John Wasley contributed 41,000 &gt;&gt; which I believe this was a big effort by a few if you ask the team leader who's the team leader for is she February, &gt;&gt; where are these team leaders? &gt;&gt; Can the deacons please ask them to come in? Okay, then I have Paul. Who is the team leader for Paul? Okay, you gave 65,000. How many contributed in your group? Five. How many do you have in your group? 15. So you can see only five out of 15. So which means the 10 they are not committed. What is commitment? Commitment is not paying million,000 giving something however little it is.
