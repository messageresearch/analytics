this congregation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus circumcise our lips and may you come and speak to us tonight in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Saint say amen amen praise the Lord amen I thank God this evening for the opportunity he has given me to stand before you spous yeah just pray for me that the Lord will use me to speak to you amen the prophet said that when you come expecting what you expect is what you get amen but least I believe that he will speak to somebody I believe speak to me as well remember when he went to the pool of Beth he heal one man and let that one man be you and me amen I just said that Lord let me be that man blessed be the name of the Lord amen I want to turn let us turn to our Bibles and we read read uh you read with me Exodus chapter uh 12 we shall read from vers 21 amen shall we read in the name of the Lord then Moses called uh then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you uh a lump according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of H soap and dip it in the blood that is in the bosom Bon and strike the lint and the two side post with the blood that is in the Bon and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning for the Lord will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side post the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come in unto your houses to Smite you and you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy Sons forever for for amen blessed be the name of the Lord precious father we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read we pray that you'll come and bless us Lord for say the blessed is the one who reth this word he who hears it Lord may you bless father those who are streaming with us this evening by the end of this service Lord each one of us will speak like those fellows our heart burn within us in Jesus nameen you may have your seat praise the Lord thank you for coming this evening yeah it is quite some time I've really been Tak I've taken some good time without standing here but God Pur and wanted me to stand tonight yeah I believe before the foundation of the world knew that I would stand before you this just want to open your heart that the Lord will speak to you this because the bible say that when he send his word his word cannot turn to him in when he spoke in the beginning and he said let there be the prophet said that he believed in his word and his word came to pass and Hebrews 138 tells us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday he's the same today and is the same forever praise be to God in among the message believer that scripture has become so common to us praise be to God but the truth is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday what he did yesterday he's still doing it today he will do it tomorrow and he will do it forever when he healed when he healed from the beginning he still heals today he will heal tomorrow and forever praise be to God so let the devil not deceive you and you think it's just a no sir praise be to God yeah back to our scripture where we have read in Exodus 12 we are seeing this was the children of Israelites praise be to God for the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter three uh it says that uh uh whoever comes to God no he say that is the high priest amen of our confession blessed be the name of the Lord so unless you confess blessed be the name of the Lord there is nothing you will get blessed be the name of the Lord amen whosoever comes to God you must first believe that he is is a rewarder he reward those who seek him not only those who are seeking him but you must seek Him diligently praise be to God not when you one leg is in the world another one is in the world you said what if it does not work and when I'm also not this side so when I come to the devil the devil will harass me praise be to God but when you come to God you have to come with full swing you have to come when you are determined praise be to God when we come to God we don't come with second mind praise be to God you come to God and tell him either you save me or I perish either you deliver me or I'm gone blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord amen and here we are seeing the Bible tells us it tells about of Israel that Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them throw out and take your lamb according to your families and kill the Passover praise be to God pass is very important it was very important in the life of the Jews praise the Lord remember when God met Moses and sent Moses to Egypt with with a sign praise the Lord and in Egypt a pharaoh also his magician and they could also perform magic so when Moses went with a sign from God he was Vindicated prophet of God God met Moses and Vindicated him and gave him two sign to go to Egypt and he told them when they don't believe the first sign they he will believe the second sign praise be to God so Moses went to Egypt he was so convinced and concerned and so contented because he had met God praise be to God Amen so when Moses went to Egypt Pharaoh also had his magicians so when they saw God sign they thought was a magic praise be to God so when he came and Dro his stuff down and he turned to serpent ah Pharaoh you just smile what a cheap magic praise be to God Amen but Moses's sign it had a voice behind it amen and even the St the the sign for the magician it also had a voice behind the sign of Moses it had the voice behind it and the voice was saying let my people go praise the Lord and tonight there is a voice declaring your Passover amen and tonight I'm going to call my Sher declaring your Passover you must declare your Passover [Applause] tonight blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise the Lord in ver say that and you shall take a bunch of and deep it in the blood that is in the B and strike the L and the two side PO with the blood that is in the BOS and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning praise be to God remember children of israelit they were in Egypt for over 4 13 years they are serving in slavery being tortured by their task blessed be the name of the Lord those are many many many many generations 430 years but they had a promise of their Deliverance blessed be the name of the Lord amen and one day God saw that now the time was ready and God met Moses and God spoke to Moses and God told him I have heard the Cry of my children praise be to God and I'm sending you to go and deliver them from their task Masters praise be to God Amen these people they were now desperate not until you are desperate you are not going to get out of that condition not until blessed be the name of the Lord that is the only way to go when Jesus was Sten from them he told them to go and wait in the upper room they were there for 10 days not one day not 30 minutes blessed be the name of the Lord but because they were desperate men and women they had to wait on the upper room because he had given them the promise he told them in the upper room until the day of the Pentecost blessed be the name of the Lord so when the time for Israel came now after 430 years God remember this promise blessed be the name of the Lord It's God who remembers his promise it's God who knows the end of your trial he knows the end of your challenges he know when you are going to receive the Holy Ghost he knows when you're going to be delivered blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah so when Moses went there after performing all the signs the pledges striking Egypt one after another Pharaoh was not checking because the Bible says that God had in Pharaoh's heart blessed be the name of the Lord this they were there for 430 years but it took God only one day one day to to deliver them blessed be the name of the Lord no matter how long you have spent in your no matter what you're fighting with you spent time fighting you as if nothing is happening you don't know what tomorrow I have a message for you tonight keep pressing on it may take 10 years it may take two years it may take 6 months it may take 20 years but the message is amen it will only cost God 30 seconds to work on that problem blessed be the name of the Lord amen just imagine being in bondage for 430 years and here God told Moses enough is enough now is the time go tell them according to your to their families let them kill the lamb and he shall take a bunch of isap dip it in the blood that is in the bom strike the L and the two side post with blood without blood amen and none of you shall go out you hear that why because the death angel was going to pass blessed be the name of the Lord one of these days one of this evening one of this night one of this morning the death angel is going to strike the land have you applied the token praise be to God when we are talking of the token in New Testament we are talking about the Holy Ghost the Seal of God are you sealed in the body are you in the church triumphant are you in the savior's bride have you been baptized into the body blessed be the name of the Lord Passover time it was a time of it was a very tricky and it was a time of moving something was going to strike the Earth Egypt had it had fallen on egyp they were in a terrible time that's why the Bible says that it is bad it is like it is so dangerous to fall like it is very dangerous for God to get a hold of you in his way amen did everything imagine give them more punishment he dou their task blessed be the name of the Lord but little they know that their Deliverance was just as the door they T oh hallelujah amen Moses's father did he know that that day he had made the last prayer God had answered the prayer that Li was already there that night was the night for passing over bless said be the name of the Lord that's why the Bible says that tears may be the night but joy comes in the morning that night Brethren the Bible tells us to remember this he told them remember this he told them in vers you shall observe this thing for ordinance to thee and to thy Sons forever blessed be the name e e e because God always chooses the ones who are for who are downen who are despised blessed be the name of the Lord amen he says for the Lord will pass through Egypt to Smite the Egyptian and when he sees the blood upon the L and on the side not only on but God was going to look at the blood over them on their left side and on their right side blessed be the name of the Lord don't apply the blood only partly that's why when we baptize we don't sprinkle water on your forhead you have to be buried blessed be the name of the Lord and the Lord will pass over the door and will and will not suffer the Destroyer to come into your hous to Smite you Egyptians had their time they had their pleasure they enjoyed their parties the slaves were serving them and they were enjoying their time blessed be the name of the Lord they had everything you want this oh the slaves they will do that you slave do that but they didn't know were people of Promise they were under the promise they were Covenant people God had Covenant with them God had promised with them he had promised them amen and some of them were on their knees those who knew their promise they were on their knees and and they could feel that pull that their time was near when a miracle is about to happen when span is about to take place those who have been crying for me when the Revival is about to take place those have been crying for Revival brother sister they can feel the pool of the Revival blessed be the name of the Lord for those have ever s for the Holy Ghost who have cried for God to give them the Holy Spirit when you about receive the Holy Ghost brother sister you will know amen it will not take you as a surprise so these people who knew their promise I believe they knew that time was ready blessed be the name of the Lord so they slaughter the lamp and then apply the blood according to the word of Moses according to the words of God blessed be the name of the Lord amen and maybe the Egyptians they didn't know that the time for bread and bread and butter ended because all Egypt was stricken The Hil Stone the Locust the frogs blessed be the name of the Lord the sea became fish died praise the Lord FES disturb them Li from the youngest to the king everybody would be scratching themselves blessed be the name of the Lord Brother sister when God begins to work oh hallelujah amen amen sometime we are squeezed by a stress sometime the devil gives us our time just keep pressing on the time is coming and that time is now amen God is not going to do anything unless you declare it unless you confess it declare your Passover because when Jesus died on the on the cross he declared Victory upon the church that day on Calvary prayed for everything we need it's up to you and me to go before the table tell the devil can hold my joy any longer it belongs to me blessed be the name of the Lord amen the prophet says that it was the time when when the Pascal lamp was slay in the message who is this and it represented their Deliverance out of Egypt the bondage Egypt means bondage they are in the bondage for all those years in time for their Deliverance had come and nobody could stop that Amen in the message Moses said that if God would deliver his people out of bondage back there [Music] from under the Egyptians so can he deliver the people from under the bondage of sickness amen you hear that that same God that same power amen which brought them out of the bondage in Egypt the same Holy Ghost the same Pillar of Fire amen it can bring out of the bondage of that sickness tonight out of the bondage of that habit out of the bondage of that trouble is to declare your Passover because Jesus has declared it over you when he died on the cross he said it is finished it is finished he paid for everything he paid for our health he paid for our blessings he paid for the Redemption of our soul and of our body and that Jesus is here tonight is leading the church amen not only not the man leading the church gracing on the man and he uses the Holy Ghost to lead the church blessed be the name of the Lord that God will deliver his people he delivers them if he did under Egyptian so can he deliver his people under the bondage of sickness and then he say that apply the token it is for you you feel in your heart there's something there is something tagging it is for you you apply the token my brethren apply the token apply the token amen the token was given on the day of Pentecost amen repent everyone of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive a holy ghost for the promises given unto you unto your children and those who are PHA and that is you and me the token was given God only recognizes the token the token has been preached until it has become now we are now used to it but let me tell you getting used to the Token is not going to save you praise be to God the Egyptians all Egyptian children playing with the CH of the Hebrew it never saved them amen it never saved them the wife of a Hebrew maning Egyptian woman that never saved be to God the thing was they're supposed to be under the token the lamb was slain the instruction had to be followed they were covered by the blood blessed be the name of the Lord you know why it was like that our Prophet tells us the blood the life is in the blood and when they innocent lamb was laay and the L the blood was smeared on the door post blessed be the name of the Lord amen when the death angel came when the death angel was passing the blood was crying we are already dead we already day and they could not die twice the angel just had to bypass them and went to the houses which had no blood because for them they were alive that's why the Bible says therefore there's no condemnation those in Christ Jesus who are not walking according to the flesh but are walking in the spirit amen they died of themselves they died of their sins and their life is hi in Christ Jesus when the angel is passing Jesus already died once for all for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believes in Him should not be perished but have everlasting life when we believe in Christ we are dead in Christ we died of our sins and we live in Christ Jesus when angel passes we cannot die the second time because you already died long ago that's why we sing sett it long ago hallelujah our sins were dropped in account of Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah am believe the Lord Jesus for you your house apply the token to your house then what do you do when you apply it to your house move all the trashes out blessed be the name of the Lord when the time for Passover came the Jews had to remove every trash it was time for moving it was time for getting out time for going to worship their God blessed be the name of the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah sometime when you are going to shift you gather rubbish you collect them with those trashes and you burn them or you pack them for garbage collectors because where you are going even when you are going to your new house amen you say I cannot take this bed there I cannot take that old coat there some people who have bed bugs they believe everything and they say honey let us go and buy new things for our new house amen because it is a new house so in the message the talken the prophet says when you apply the token to your house then what you do you what you do when you apply it to your house move all the trash out don't leave those means scut in your wardrobes don't put on those to anymore amen don't even give your lipsticks to your sisters because she's not a Believer crash those lipstick put them in the garbage can amen because the token you have applied cannot accommodate those things but many times believers they don't want to put them trash out blessed be the name of the Lord and yet when they are shifting they don't go with those trash so the Egyptians they saw that Jew is like they're playing com oh glory be to God and in the days of The Voice hallelujah amen they were in the days of their voice God had spoken to them amen God sent them prophets God himself walking in Moses and a prophet so they heard the voice of God they were updated of what was taking place the Egyptian never knew that the Jews were declaring their Passover amen so they saw they may moving the trashes out amen we cannot go with this one we are going the promised land just imagine the land milk and honey blessed be the name of the Lord so they Waring for the mil and honey the the Egyptians thought they playing and then after they saw every house Lo they're like there's something going on for all for the 430 years we've never seen and maybe Egyptian astrologers maybe that night they had nightmare through the night because when Jesus comes the temp's power is broken amen when Jesus passes you away no sh can stand no devil will remain there because the the mighty conquer is passing by because God had visited Egypt demons were in trouble blessed be the name of the Lord aftering the sh they started very weird the israelit let me tell you death always bring people into desperation maybe you are nursing your patient hospital the doctor tells according to what we are saying we've done everything and uh to save you a little money this patient need to be treated at home is in it's in other words it's like they're saying we have eaten enough this person is not going to be you will find the whole family is in desperation relatives are in desperation because their loved one is going but these people God told them the death angel is going to pass they had never heard about the death angel seen it they used to being their bondage but that dayam said in that very message they talking that may be the children of the Hebrew the firstborn went to their father and told them dad are you sure that you have applied the talk and I'm your first they had to be sure because something was going to take place amen amen Rapture is coming are we ready are you desperate for [Applause] Rapture praise be to God the sister comes the husband I'm the first at home you also are you sure that this is they had to be sure not just thinking maybe I don't know whether I'm a Believer or not one day I prayed i f fire open I have the Holy Spirit be sure you have the talking oh I remember when pastor preached I remember the other when he came from Z and he preached and I cried I think I have be sure because the death angel is going to don't presume Shake Yourself Amen Let us make our calling and sure because the moment is coming the moment is coming when your wife will not save you your husband will not save you amen that's why the Bible tells us we should seek him while still near time is coming when men and women will seek God and they will not find him they will cry and God will not answer them blessed be the name of the Lord and even L one believer even Bine believer let me tell you the day God will leave you you will know you will know even that small presence will not be over blessed be the name of the Lord you will go to football they even kick the ball and the ball will come to you and you start crying what is wrong with this the defender of their team you will go to disco club they will put all the songs you will just get out blessed be the name of the Lord you will know that the presence of God has left when the presence of God left Soul he knew even even knew because when Samuel went to him three times knew that there's something happening he was a priest he had experience with God he knew that that God is Shifting season now amen and then he told him when he come answer like this and when God came back he replied the way the pro the pre instructed and in the morning he pressed him now tell me what did he you see please tell me he knew blessed be the name of the Lord so you you better declare your Passover now because there's the blood of Jesus which speaks good words amen Jes is still saving Soul he still gives the Holy Ghost he still gives Church the victory he still heals and deliver but unless you declare it upon you check yourself amen am shake your conscience blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah remove all those stret out if Satan try to hand you to hand you some of this stuff like sickness you know what you do just show him the token amen show the devil the token when he come with stress show him the token when he come with this adultery with his fornication with his wickedness show him the token amen don't show him yourm don't show him your baptism card show him the token prayer is the most vital force that God ever put in the hand of man most effective force that is known to man is prayer apply the token in prayer amen apply the token in prayer it will not come automatically God for me if you want to give him the Holy Spirit he will give me you will not receive I was reading a quote this this morning where was talking about his about about I think the daughter-in-law she has fed until now she's very slim tiny she can't even walk steadily but you can even Skip One me you cannot fast at all I don't have time for fasting because food is everywhere Maybe or because maybe you have peace of mind you cannot come and spend a night at church or you cannot spend a night in your sitting room praying even when you're praying in your bedroom you lie and first the ceiling and you cover yourself with your blanket you're being under the blanket how I'm feeling this morning my head is so heavy but you said in your word even before I speak you already know let me tell you brother amen is the high priest of your confession declare you Passover amen you cannot overcome the devil that way no sir from the time of John the Baptist until today the kingdom of God suffered violence and take it by force byce you see brother the Bible says not by power not by might but by the I believe that 100% even the devil believes that scripture and then he will make you to misinterpret it even if I don't pray even even if I just pray under my blanket not by or by mind but the Bible says Jesus cried in The loudy Voice you think when Jesus went to the mountain he was just there then you remember you've been praying that's what the devil want blessed be the name of the Lord but this kind of prayer the prophet about is the prayer where you arise and you worship God and you sing praise to God and you lift up your hands say hosana hallelujah before you realize you already in tongues you're already praying God I thank you because you've done it I thank you because you're great and the devil that's that kind of prayer that devil can't understand that kind of prayer it makes the devil mad amen there is a brother who used to pray he prays and pray and pray and he reaches somewhere then he goes and open the door and he said demons now get out get out get out blessed be the name of the Lord he had somewhere I say now demons but when you enter when you are in the anointing when you are under the anointing of God demons will look for even where they cannot pass they will pass there amen Jesus say they will come in one way Hallelujah but he will Smite them and they will be scattered in seven days blessed be the name of the Lord when we know our promises we are going to declare it over us let us declare victory over our children over our families over our wives over our businesses in whatever we do blessed be the name of the Lord amen he say the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the contol of man human being brother not atomic bomb no sir this is the second quote this the second in expectation the message expectation 6127 is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the cont of human being there is no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God blessed be the name of the Lord amen God delivered Israel because somebody was praying in the message Moses but talks about Moses father pray every evening and morning he comes when he's so tired and then he goes up and he pray God your promise you say and now is the time blessed be the name of the Lord Jeremiah tells us the Daniel tells us the same thing by the Scrolls of Jeremiah he knew that the time had come 70 years had elapsed he went in prayer and fasting to do what to find the mind of God Amen and God is always looking for somebody who is willing who who is seeking for his will blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise be to God declaring our Passover in the morning the whole Egypt were screaming from the King to the PO they were screaming the death angel never spared anybody no matter how rich they were how great they were amen even in the king's Palace oh brother sister that time is at hand the Death Angel is coming again in the message the oncoming storm Prophet say the storm is coming is going to strike that house where have you built your house which Foundation amen and say that storm is death if you don't believe Christ if you don't receive the token and you go before the [Applause] Rapture you are lost praise be to God but there is a blood which was shed for us if you can only believe hallelujah hallelujah brother in this message here says in the message Gus a secret believer he says our Heaven father we rebuke all the powers of Darkness Satan you are defeated declare that the devil is defeated amen amen say Satan you are defeated the devil has no right over us we are purchased with the blood of Jesus God himself came from glory to Redeemer praise be to God declare that upon you he says and now here he was talking to a certain sister say that here she has a misery in her side but now I rebuke that misery how did the prophet know because the angel of the Lord was in the in the same Pillar of Fire the same Ang of the Covenant he has never forgotten his Covenant every day is moving in the church the same Holy Ghost the same presence is what is leading the church tonight that presence has never left is still leading the church blessed be the name of the Lord that is what has kept you going for all this year sometime you are beaten full of scars you feel like you want to give up but that Covenant remember the message the power of the call amen there is a power behind the calling which we were called with the Holy calling blessed be the name of the Lord amen the prophet sent a message uh healing and what cancer is he was praying and said that in the name name of Jesus Christ I rebuke the devil of cancel may it leave you then I rebuke the stomach trouble in the name of Jesus Christ that it leaves you I rebuke that swelling in the name of Jesus Christ iuke that cloud let us pray in desperation the reason as why we are not seeing the result is because we don't pray in desperation Lord you know I was working the whole day I really want to pray that's why AP Paul says oh that's why Jesus says the body is willing the spirit is willing but the body is weak is that a prayer or excuse blessed be the name of the Lord but say let us pray in desperation watch for the kingdom of God it will come upon you you see the disciple were desperate their master was taken from them the first day things looked normal the second day things were still normal the third day this one was was a he was a tax collector the other one was the fisherman the other one was this the taken three and a half years not fishing Peter not fishing blessed be the name of the Lord and others not doing their activities let me tell you just leave campala for 3 and a half years and come back you will even lack where to begin from the rate at which the world is Chang you will reach think that in Old at old and maybe used to to live there and you're looking for them this man for all their master was taken sometimes he could bring up a eat bread amen just imagine now going back to the Feld Peter used to use probably they are now different blessed be the name of the Lord some try to go and try to hustle with life but because they were told amen the seed was planted and they had the seed of God in them I believe some the Holy Ghost something started speaking to their hearts said but he never told us to go back to fish because in Exodus where we read the Bible says they were told to remain in the house until morning they were not supposed to go out because the death angel was going to pass this men were told to rep in the upper room go in the upper room until the day of the Pentecost they not supposed to live there until the day of the Pentecost what were they doing there this is what they were doing there they doing this prayer is the most vital for that God ever put in the hand of mankind they were praying there are the altar praying Mary was pring Mary was praying hallelujah hallelujah she was moving maybe oh you promise he never say my son you promise oh my son you say come us no my days are going but I know you are coming no sir said God your promise je said and we are waiting you say if you don't go the comter will not come can you pray that kind can you make that kind of pray under your bed human brain is designing the weather the moment you lay on the bed the body will just think want so the sleeping switch will all be activated and maybe Peter went to the sea to fish but when reached there maybe the people are now on speed boats a man who even didn't know how to write his name probably the government had brought new fishing methods taking throw into the lake and then pull and say this thing will not work because Jesus had preached to them he had packed them they were under the word though they were not converted but they were a little bit transformed yes they were Justified and Sanctified amen they just waiting for the B of the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord then on the ninth day maybe those who were weak they started gaining strength huj those were sitting like in the overnight and maybe crossing their legs they stood out and they started lifting their hands and praying God is saved scripture started to come in their mind they started now quoting the scriptures taking God at his word and all of a sudden amen they are declaring their victory amen maybe they remember where just said it is finished father you said it is finished when on the cross he said it is finished he said all the power in Heaven and Earth is given to you and there came a sound of a mighty rushing wind amen amen and a ball of fire came clothing tongues of Fire it was sped among them Hallelujah then they got that old time religion and they ran in the streets started preaching blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen because they had received their Passover they received their Victory blessed be the name of the Lord and that's what God is expecting the church he has paid the price but until you go and ask for the book a little book you eat it let us wait on our knees we approaching the end of this year don't let this year go without you being filled with the Holy Spirit instead of being there judging others pointing fingers on others go on your knees cry for yourself amen we have a task we have a role to play God change me God renew me restore me fill me touch me change me raise me cleans me blessed be the name of the Lord because we are living images we Christ God expect us to live like Christ and the time we are living in and the time you are spending Church there things by now we don't even expect you that you're still fighting with them we believe you are moving into Perfection every single day but we still fighting with football going to cinema halls going to disco and you're also claim that you're waiting for rapture prepare yourself you know that youve you've not received the Holy Spirit you are not even seeking you are not concerned I don't have time for those things but it will be too late for you where I will cry you will mourn and it will be too late you'll find yourself with the young ruler in hell and you'll ask him you the one who told when he was here want to be on the bosom of Abraham if I happen to go before the Rapture Abraham say this very message that let let uh that let us pray in desperation wash for the kingdom of God shall we stand on our feet wash for the kingdom of God it will come upon you pray say our Heaven father let us pray in desperation for the kingdom of God he say father I pray thee in Jesus name be merciful unto us Lord and start in us a desperation I pray for you and I pray for for I pray for you and you pray for me and will stay with it with effectual fervent prayer until it is answered that is the desperation your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you confess it you can put other things there you believe that God has answered your prayer confess it and God will make your body obey your confession God will make your body to obey your confession amen all of us can live a holy life blessed be the name of the Lord all of us we can live above sin all of us we can be filled with the Holy Spirit just imagine when each one of us is filled with the Holy Spirit from Young to the old what a moment where everybody has been on his knees crying for God to speak to him over everyone is battling with things in their life God give me victory over this and then we come with the same mind when we are tuned KN that God is going to speak let me tell you something will take place Supernatural will be manifested God will prove his word he will manifest his word in your life because that is the Cry of our heart declaring our Passover blessed be the name name of the Lord when God declares it no devil can hold you don't allow the devil to hold in any condition amen because when the days we are living in God sent a message of restoration and we must be restored amen we must be restored you must live a restored life you must worshiping a Resto way whatever we do amen are you restored blessed be the name of the Lord may
