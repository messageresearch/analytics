Because of the political climate that Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I thank God that you have come that there is a force within you which is more powerful than the one in the world. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Our pastor is not with us here. He's in western Kenya Kenya. I have not heard from him this morning but we last spoke last evening. He's fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will not say that he has sent greetings because if he had if he had talked this morning definitely would have sent his greetings. Praise be to God. Yeah. I don't want to take it lightly and say that pastor has greeted you. Yeah. Because you have not spoken this morning. Yeah. Uh shall we turn to our Bible this morning? &gt;&gt; Is everybody okay? Are you fine in the Lord? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just pray for me. That the Lord will use me to speak to you this morning. &gt;&gt; I want to turn to the book of Genesis chapter 22. We are reading from verses 15. and reading the name of the Lord. Amen. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abram out of heaven the second time, and said, "By myself I have uh by myself have I sworn, says the Lord. For because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the son which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gates uh the gate of his enemy. And in thy seed shall all the nation of the earth be blessed because thou [snorts] has obeyed my voice. Now you get Amen. Precious Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord. We have read the post John of the scripture on our father Abraham, &gt;&gt; the father of faith. Lord, we pray that you come and take the full prayer. We refuse every working of the enemy. We seal all other voices today and let your voice be heard in our midst. For you promise that two or three, you will come and be in our midst. Lord that is our confidence this morning to know that you are here. You have a table spray and we have come to die in Christ Jesus. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You may have your seats. Yeah. This morning, &gt;&gt; uh, I'm going to talk about Limitless God. That's my text. Limitless God. With unlimited blessing. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we've seen where we have just read God speaking to Abraham. And all Bible readers knows about Abraham. How is the father of faith? How God called him out of nowhere. Not because he was good. Brother Edson, you're most welcome. God bless you. How he was good, he was not good. But out of the blue, just like the way God called Noah, praise be to God. Amen. The Bible tells us about Abraham. I was the son of Terror. And God one day by unmmerited grace met Abraham. He called him and told him to leave his land to leave his country and go to another country where God had chosen him to do. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. And Abraham obeyed the voice of God. and went to that land. He started the journey to the land where he had never been before. Praise be to God. That is how interested our God is. When God called us, when he calls you, he tells you about the promised land, about the rapture. Amen. Jesus said, "I'm going to prepare a place and where I'm going to be, you'll also be there." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; He he never talked about these other things. He says that in this earth there is a lot [snorts] of sorrow. He did not specify which type of sorrow but there are many sorrow. Take heart. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So is limitless God. Blessed be the name of God. And where we have read here. Here we are seeing God calling Abraham. The angel of God called unto Abraham out of heaven. Second time. Here we are reading this for the second time. And he said, and and said, "By myself I have sworn, says the Lord, &gt;&gt; for because thou has done this thing, and has not withheld thy son, thy only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy son. as the stars of heaven, and as the son which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy. Here we are seeing God promising Abraham blessing. But it was after something had happened. Abraham obeyed the voice of God. God told Abraham. Praise be to God. God gave a promise with this promise took so long and finally it came to pass. Because when God give a promise, no matter how long it will take, but in finally it will come to pass. Because if God send this word, this word does not return to him for you. That word will have to perform. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. When God gives us the word of promise says I'm the Lord God all your diseases. He means that. And when you are sick, you are under obligation. Come to God. Tell God promise. Amen. That by your stripes, I am healed. Praise be to God. And when you cling onto that, you stand in that word. When you claim that promise, you don't have demons, you can defy that word. Thus say, "Praise be to God." The prophet says, "The word of God will defeat the devil any time, anywhere, any place, [screaming] praise be to God because when God speaks, that word cannot." So when God called Abraham, Abraham left his country. Praise be to God. And he went, he started at Genesis 21. And we all know the story that alongside the way, he went with with Lord, praise be to God, and as long as they were still together, he never heard the voice of God. He had troubles. Praise be to God. Amen. The handsman started fighting. So as long as we car things which God does not expect us to have. We are going to have trouble. We are going to have chaos. Praise be to God. Our salvation will be full of trouble. Every time a believer complaining, everything is not working. I have prayed and prayed. I God is unfair. God is not unfair. Are you certain of God? &gt;&gt; Have you checked yourself? Are you carrying on with the Lord? Blessed be the name of the Lord. My text is a limitless God. You cannot limit him. God can do anything anywhere at any place regardless of the situation. Praise be to God. You can't limit him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God speaks, &gt;&gt; he means it. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; So, it's limitless &gt;&gt; and it's packed with unlimited blessings. Amen. God's blessing is unlimited. Praise be to God. But there's only one problem. It's a condition. Hallelujah. If we obey, we shall enjoy the fruit of the land. If we don't obey, we will have trouble. We'll have problems. But I'm here to tell you that our God is limitless and he carries unlimited blessings. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Looking to see there is no limit to the blessings that God will pour down upon a believer. Blessed be the name of the Lord that God will pour down upon a believer that will believe. And he says in spiritual inspiration, God's blessings will never be exhausted to a believer. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The whole world can never exhaust God's presence. Blessed be the name of God. But there is only one condition to walk in the words. There we activate these things. Activate unlimited power of God in the name of God. When we are in the word, God is limitless. There's nothing that can limit him. Praise be to God. One time Paul and Silas when they in jail, Amen. They thought that was the end of them, maybe even themselves. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So when they in change they may be themselves because they are human being like us. They feel pain like us after being beaten after being tortured. They are in chain and they're in prison. Blessed be the Lord. But their suffering was for good cause. because of the gospel. Praise be to God. And somewhere somehow maybe when they were there pondering on what made them to be beaten or what made them to be to be arrested. Hallelujah. You know a believer we have something unique in us. The spirit of God in us. the spirit of God in our when we are discouraged. That is what encourages us. Praise be to God. And maybe when they were there, something inside them was whispering to them. You see, see now the reward. You've been preaching, casting out demons. You've been beaten. Where is that God? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But these men were not discouraged. The Holy Spirit started to minister with him. That is the God we serve. When you reach a point where you're seeing there is no hope, there is no plan B, there's no plan C. God is only plan A. Praise be to God. You know why God is only plan A? God cannot fail. Amen. He knows end from the beginning. How many steps you going to take on earth? last step. Glory. Amen. And he has commission each one of us to be guided by angel that guardian angel guiding you every day. We have deployment all over this place right now as we are protecting. Blessed be the name of and our God cannot run short of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name. That's right. Through all the dark ages today, our God has never run short of forces. And I'm here to tell you this morning that our God cannot be limited. And God has a limited blessing, a limited blessing, blessed be the name of. And when Abraham obeyed God, praise be to God. But God told Abra and offer his son, praise the Lord, and he obeyed. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. The enemy is trying to uh make lose my notes. Praise be to God. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it says &gt;&gt; and said uh by myself have I strong says the Lord. &gt;&gt; For because thou has not thou has done this thing. and has not withheld thy son. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. God swore by his soul. Praise be to God because there was no other greater that for my word to fail. Praise be to God. Because he knew that his word cannot. Hallelujah. He could not swear by any man, by any prophet or any angel by himself because he knows his word cannot fail as good as his word. And because Abraham believed God, he never spared his only son, the son of his old age. Praise be to God. It's because he had a revelation. God gives and blessed be the name. Amen. And after God tried him, he said, "Now Abraham activated God's blessing." But he had to first be tried. Every time you ask God for things, do something try by that very thing. What are you going to do? Blessed be the name. Maybe you want a phone. He gives you a phone and he wonders how are you going to use that phone? Maybe you pray for a car. He has given you a car. How are you going to use that car? Blessed be the name of maybe brother Martin used to come early by 8 and after God giving him a car he comes at midday you can't activate God is bless bless Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. So I was telling about Paul and Silas when they in shame something within them the Holy Ghost minister to them. And the Bible says they started to praise God. Amen. Because they knew it was them in shame, not God in chain. Because greater in them was greater than the one the shame. And the Bible say they started to praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. And through praising God, praising God. Amen. Something happened. I don't think it was the first song. neither the second one. Praise be to God because they had to be tried. They had to be proved by the gospel they preached. Yes. The very Jesus who make the lamb to walk to see love to hear when comes the preachers. Will you believe? Amen. That that same Jesus can open your death ears. &gt;&gt; It is very easy bro. It's very simple to tell others to convince others. Yes sir. Praise the Lord. Amen. But when it comes to you tells To pray for someone who is sick, you have to first feel that empathy. You be in their shoes because even Jesus is the high priest who is touched by the feeling of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The reason why Jesus came on flesh, he wanted to test what we testing today. He went through the pain we are going through. When you say my body is aching, Jesus knows what it mean. Jesus knows what headache. When you say I am tempted, Jesus knows what it means to be tempted. That's why he is the high priest who is touched by the feeling of Christ. Blessed be the name of Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That is the God we are serving. We not serving a strange God. We are not serving a deaf God. We are serving a God who feels, who hears, who sees. Amen. That is our God. Many time when we are trying, we think he's just there. The other day one brother was telling me, he was telling me sometime how the Pentecostals pray. Oh God for you. You are there. You are enjoying. Angels are waving over you. &gt;&gt; Jesus knows what it means to be there without even [screaming] a call. But because he is limitless and is packed with unlimited blessings is everywhere. One day a blind bath came to him. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. He came crying said Jesus son of David have mercy on me. You know what Jesus did? &gt;&gt; He never asked Peter for medical kit. He not check his eyes. Let us see. Praise be to God. That day the world did not know &gt;&gt; the secret on the ground. Jesus just sp and smeared on the ground and he gain his sight unlimited blessing. Amen. You can't limit our God. Many time when we are squeezed, you wonder how you're going to go through that. He comes and makes a way. That is the God we are serving. We cannot fail and he's not going to fail us. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of. Amen. What is keeping us going unlimited bless? Because our God is limitless. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And after Abraham had gone through the test and he told him &gt;&gt; in blessings, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he told that you your seed possess the gates of Amen. &gt;&gt; We are to possess the gates of our enemy. Blessed be the name That is a promise. God gave it to us. He said to receive it, not reject it. That's what the Lord said and that cannot fail. Blessed be the name. I'm going to read something uh in in the book of Psalms. Amen. Amen. Somehow I lost my notes but I know God will give me the grace. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I want us to read read with me Psalms. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want us to read uh and see uh here in Psalms. what God some of the things which God did in Egypt. Here it says in Psalms chapter 78 &gt;&gt; uh from vers 15. &gt;&gt; Okay, we can start from uh we can start from verse 9. He say that he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as a heap. In the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire. You can read &gt;&gt; that is Psalms chapter 78 uh from vers 13. Yes. many time when read uh such a scripture we read like we're reading a novel. But when you read this scripture and you ponder, you see what your God can do and you compare that with your situation, the things that you are going through, the God we are speaking about is a God who parted se. Amen. Amen. 35 say, "And they remembered that God, sorry, hed the rock in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of great depth. He brought streams also out of the rock and caused the waters to run down like river. And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness. And they tempted God in their heart by asking me for their lust. Yeah. They spoke against God and they said, "Can God furnish a temple in the wilderness?" After doing all those things, that is the nature of human being. Blessed be the name of the Lord. They never get satisfied. Somebody can say give me some 50,000 and then you give them &gt;&gt; I wish I asked for 200,000 &gt;&gt; blessed be but with human being we are we have a limit whatever we do has a limit. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But our God, he has a limitless blessing, unlimited blessing. &gt;&gt; But he only calls us. He's calling us to walk in the word. Believe to trust him because it is possible. With him all things are possible. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He only called upon to obey the word to live according to that word. Blessed be the name of God has never failed anybody. He has never failed any human being. He always be there on time. Many time we don't hold on enough. Blessed be the name of But when you think he's not coming, he is already present. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name. So our God, they tempted him. And this thing is not very far from us. God heals you today. Tomorrow another situation arises and you doubt. Praise be to God and you think maybe you are not sick the other day. It was just feelings and that's what the devil always do. But the God we are serving is a miracle working God and you cannot limit him. He makes there's no blessed be the name. The Bible says that God allowed them to go through what they went through. Blessed be the name because he wanted to see what was in their heart. Amen. When God called Abraham after he had obeyed to the maximum, God released his blessing. And all of us we looking at God is blessing and we'll have to obey the word first. Amen. Amen. Because our God has no limit. When he speaks, he means it. It's God who fulfills his word. He spoke and said, "The virgin shall conceive." Took many years, but it came to pass because the Lord God has spoken. And that same God promised us in last year that we send a prophet. It took many years. Finally came. Amen. And we are here waiting for the coming of the Lord. And we are so sure that he's coming soon because he has given us down pain which is the birth of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let us press on knowing that our God will never limit our God. Just imagination of Israel after God had done all this parting and just putting table. Which one is harder? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Redeeming your soul, giving you salvation and healing your body. Which one is more hard? Giving his son. Amen. As a ransom for sinner and giving you money. Which one is high? Blessed be the name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he's a limitless God. With unlimited blessing, blessed be the name of. Amen. He said that so Abraham turned to histo young young men 19. He turned at his young men and rose up and went together to Bashba and Abraham dwelt at Bashba. pass after these things of Abraham saying behold Mila. She hath also bon children unto thy brother who is his firstborn and B his brother came the father and sh and and &gt;&gt; praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse 12, this say and Sarah was uh was 107 and two and and 20 years. There were the years of the life of Sarah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Because Sarah had a promise. God had promised Abraham. had to bear a son and because he obeyed the word, God had to honor his promise even this generation we are living in. He promised us we are going to be raptured and that's what that's where our hope is every single day. Even when you feel like giving up, just remember. Amen. Remember for future home. Blessed be the name of God. You cannot limit God. And we should never do that. We know where we are going. We know where we came from. If you don't know where you came from, then you have amnesia. Every time I think of looking back, I see I've come too far to look back. Blessed be the name of I believe when I was 13. Blessed be the name of. Amen. Until today, there is no reason of me looking back. Because the Bible tells us to look unto Jesus who is the author who is the finisher. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It is Jesus who called us. As long as Abraham looked at God. Amen. He was willing. As long as Israel looking they look they never lost even single battle always want us to look back around us battles we are fighting brother sister. It is God fighting for us. He said they shall you shall hold your peace and I will fight for you. We always lose the battle because we mama. We think it is our battle. Things are not moving well. But how shall we overcome? &gt;&gt; In younger. Praise be to God. Death does not mean that you are being defeated. Our death is just a rest. When Elisha died and they threw the dead body and the dead body came in contact to his bones, the Bible says the dead man resurrected. Praise be to God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that's why we can never be defeated because the one we are serving God has never lost anybody. He will always win proof to the devil. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. He has given us the best, the best weapon, the best antidote, the best victory. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. The God we are serving, he has never failed. He will never fail us. &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage you this morning. Let us keep pressing on. Let us keep pushing on. Blessed be the name of God. Amen. Amen. is a limitless God with unlimited blessing. The proverb says here in the in the message uh the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world when Satan perverted uh perverted to evil blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. When Satan perverted to evil, God being infinite looked down [screaming] through the stream of time and saw the end for knowledge. If he didn't if he didn't know all things, you have a limited God. You have made him finite like you have. God is unlimited. God is power knowledge. He is omotant. And way back before the foundation of the earth when Satan done the evil caused Satan had his mind what he was going to do. God seen how he could how he could contract it. Praise be to God. Are you seeing the God we are serving? He sees the plan of the devil. &gt;&gt; God does not disorganize Satan's plans. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; He allows the devil to do his ammunitions. What God does, you will get a solution. Blessed be the name of the Lord. If you realize among us this papa countries there's a country like America, you rarely hear them bragging. No sir, but there are some other small nations. Even Russia will never hear Russia bragging. But there's no small nation. Every small thing now we have this now this one this weapon of an eye this and this and before you realize they have beaten them up. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you wonder where's all the shout. Look at Israel. Where is position today? The battles they are fighting. There is no other nation in the world fighting battles like Israel. They are surrounded by the ring of fire. Praise be to God. But they are not intimidating. Iran will wake up in the morning and say in the next 24 hours you are done. &gt;&gt; The good thing with a Jew with Israelite they don't warn before you realize your airport is on fire. That is their warning. Praise be to God. The promise says here &gt;&gt; that God way back. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew that Satan will rebel. He knew that the weapons that the devil was going to come out with solution for it and then he waited for him. Praise be to God. Oh, what a spiritual warfare. Amen. And I'm here to tell you there's no weapon in the devil's arm that the devil will come with God will run and say this one of today and this is mercy. No sir. When the devil comes out with his bed, &gt;&gt; God just looked at he sees a crown. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The devil is carrying a huge weapon today. He knows he's carrying his best. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But there is unlimited God with unlimited weapons. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God has stood the test of time. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Amen. Amen. And the prophet tells us what is the word. The word is the thought being expressed. &gt;&gt; There is no way the devil can defeat that. So when he carries his best day, brother is finished. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. There a lot of things coming in my mind. Just imagine you are enemies. They have made an ambush with all the tanks, with all the missile, with even nuclear talk of hydrogen bomb and all their fingers on the trigger. Blessed be the name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they're waiting to finish you. They know you are done today. We are finished. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And maybe they're on countdown. Praise be to God. They on countdown. And when it reaches zero, your God pulls out all the fuse. You see nuclear bomb, it has some component in it. And when this pulled out, it is as useless as a stick. So God wait for the devil &gt;&gt; to plan his best to take his time to waste his time. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when is attacking he comes with a solution. Blessed be the name. That is the God we are serving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet says that God's power, God's knowledge and everything is ominant. We have read there he says he says in the message hidden life there is no summit to God's power. We move on God and we move on and on and on. The unlimited resources of God has never been tapped to yet. Blessings and powers that we know nothing about. Bring all the miracles in the world, all the signs and wonders, all the healings that prophet is telling us. We have not even tapped in it. Oh, what a wonderful God. Brother, we have not seen He said the life that is within us awakening Jesus in the message awakening Jesus 63017 I said the life that is within us is not only creative life it is part of his own life and that is the reason we have the authority to speak is God's own creative life. But there is if here if you are anointed correct praise be to God. This is creative power. We don't beg the devil. We rebuke. We rebuke diseases. We cast out. We don't expect to hear a brother testifying. Yesterday we were somewhere and we are praying for the patient. So we went as we were jazzing with those demons asking them where they came from and they are telling us they came from Zambia Zambia. What do you want? We are not leaving. We are taking him. And then we asked the demon what is the problem? God never said us to do it. Praise be to God. He said God therefore go into the world. Preach the gospel. Whatsoever believes and baptiz shall be saved and this son shall follow them in his name. You will cast out on the sick. Praise be to God. Casting them out time to waste. Your your time is precious. You are given all this power provided that you anointed correctly. But when you anointed wrongly, you are going to start selling the tree of life in the church and holy water. They even selling communions today, small bottles. [crying] Praise be to God. It used to be with Catholics, but today in Smon's bornagain churches, yes, they are selling them. 50,000 a pocket Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; He never sent us to sell communion. &gt;&gt; He never sent us to make money. He is rich. But he told us go cast out demons, preach the gospel, heal the sick, cleanse the lepers. We are given free freely give. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But when say we have creative power, we can create atmosphere around our home, atmosphere around our workplace. Yes sir, you can create one where you are right now. Do you know the reason as to why you are slumbering? Because bad spirit are hovering over you. The S is in front but for you feeling something. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, we are sons of God. I was just reminding ourselves that our God has limitless if we obey the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we walk in the word, praise be to God. There's nothing that we cannot do. There is no miracle that cannot be performed by a believer. Praise be to God. There is no sickness that has audacity over you that can put you under shame say that Calvary the devil's back was broken. Amen. We are dealing with a with a sick guy. The strength of human being is back upon And when your backbone is broken, you are as good as a jellyfish. Jellyfish, jellyfish. It does not have a backbone. &gt;&gt; It has to wait for the waves to come &gt;&gt; and then the waves take it and if it has to go the other side, it has to wait for waves. &gt;&gt; So the devil's back was broken. If you start talking about how limitless is our God through the ages, God has proved that. Amen. Talk of the matters how they were killed. How they were murdered. Amen. But God has always proved that he is God. Blessed be the name. He has never failed anywhere. Some told the Israelites. Amen. Remember when you remember the Jero saga? Not to fight but just sing. Just rotate the city seven days. Praise be to God. On the last day seven days and just shout that is the God we are serving. Amen. There's no reason as to why &gt;&gt; a believer is dry where you there are some believers to get an from them. I don't remember when I last slumbered in church. Because when you just close your eyes and you think of God's goodness, brethren, there's something that I've realized during this uh internet shutdown. I realize that we believers age when they cut off internet it is like we went back into stony age period and I was thinking how rapture will be just imagine you are in a situation you're not even sure whether brother is That's why we better be ready for the rapture, brethren. It is sacred catching away of the bride. Praise be to God. Let us be on our knees. Let's be connected spiritually. Praise be to God. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But one thing I know when I was coming this morning, the place not very far from home was in a trench. I saw a very big plant. This plant grew in between the rock and and cement and I was I was just imagining the power of God in the seed. It was not even a big plant but just I think I think it is just some green plant. &gt;&gt; I even took its picture because it was amazing. &gt;&gt; And then something came in my mind that that is how the children of God are. No matter where they are, no matter how chained they are, there is a force within them. Amen. The life of God that breaks every chain. How could that small tiny seed penetrate through hard if that is not God? What is wrong and what makes you think God cannot deliver you out of the situation you go? Praise be to God. If just a little plant can penetrate through the hard. Oh brother, sister, how much more the spirit of God, the Holy Ghost is more than able to set us free out of every chain, out of every bondage that God is more than able out of every habit. I don't care how strong it is. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Maybe you are here &gt;&gt; and there are things you are battling with &gt;&gt; and even as the service is going on you really. Let me tell you my brother and my sister inside you there is a potential there is a limitless power which you just don't know but if you can activate [screaming] that amen you are more than freemen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say that nature teaches us Jesus gave an example. He said, "If our father in heaven, &gt;&gt; he's taking care of sparrows." He ask a question. If I also ask you the same question, how many of you have ever found sparrow dead because of If God is taking care of bad have no sick B. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; BS have no hospitals. But can you wonder, do they get sick? I think they do. Who heals them? &gt;&gt; If you have veterary doctor, you can tell us how many birds have ever treated ever since. Praise be to God. But it's only broilers. It's only broilers. So if God can take care of birds rangers are there for buffaloos. They are not there bro but they knows when they are hurt. Have you ever seen a cat eating grass or dog? Do you know why? It's medicine. Eating is medicine. If God can take care of this, how about us? &gt;&gt; The things that just simple simple things which we overlook, they become like forgotten beatitudes. Blessed be the name of God. But when we look at things from that point of view, those things make sense. &gt;&gt; We don't need to be miserable. God take care of each and every bird, each and every animal. Ever since he created them, God has never went bankrupt. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Children of Israel in the wilderness 40 years, no changing shoes, no changing clothes. Probably the clothes would wash themselves. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that same God is the God we are we are serving today. Hebrews 13:8. It has become a slogan now. Jesus Christ the same yesterday. Jesus Christ. Brethren, this is not mere words. The same God, who drive that sun in the morning who drive the sun in the morning and take it the other way in the evening. That same God is the one who gives us life. He's our provider. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. is the one taking care of each one of us. God is our strength. God is our effort. God is our freedom. Our healing is our provider. Our deliver [screaming] is our everything. Our song, our effort, our health. Our plans is our food &gt;&gt; and he cannot fail us. &gt;&gt; Let us not limit his blessings. When the Bible say as it was in the days of Lord, let us not only look at the Sodom side. Many time when spoken like that people's mind run to homosexual moral decay. But there is something that was happening in that very time. When the two angels went to Sodom, another angel was with Abra, the angel of life. He was ministering to Abra discerning the heart of Sarah. Praise be to God. And the prophet tells her the two angels which were to the world denomination world. &gt;&gt; And who is the second one? Bill. But where is the angel of life? The end of life is with a bride. is deciding the heart of Sarah. Amen. Is revealing secret to Abra. &gt;&gt; Your wife Sarah will give birth to a son. That same Jesus, he is in the camp tonight. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. Let us not only look at the negative side. Our main interest is in the positive side that the angel of life is with a bride. Hallelujah. Amen. And when he is with us, &gt;&gt; can I hide some? Can I hide really anything from my friend Abraham? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I hide this from you, brother? Praise be to God. He was discerning. He was revealing the secret to Abraham. [screaming] Praise be to God. And today, the same angel, he is here. The one who got the pillar of fire. That same angel is here. He's discerning the heart. He's revealing to your promises. He says the Holy Ghost is yours. It belongs to you. Amen. Is the same God telling us. We are free. We are not under bondage. We are delivered. We are delivered sons of God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Yes sir. That's why we say we know where we are going. We know where we are. We know where we came from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The reason that's why believers dagger because they forget where they came from. But if you know that you are once a sinner, once a slave in the devil's pawn shop, they are dying and rotting hopeless without God. And one day Jesus came your way and delivered you out of that house remained the same. Sir, that can't happen. When you look at moral decay in the world, mothers walking naked. Praise be to God. The whole family naked like a mother duck leading the duckling. No. Do you know how the ducks move? always move in line. It is the mother and the duckling will follow. We are living in the generation where a mother leaves a house with a panty and the old children boys with the damages with us. Let's go have party. Let's go to KFC. KFC. But when you you a believer, you look at yourself. The Bible says the sins of Sodom breaks the heart of Lord every day. That grace, don't take it for granted. That grace means a lot. If God came down for you, just like Abraham, he was not better than he was even he was worshiping creation. He was a moon worshiper. But the grace of God found him until one day God himself came down and met Abra. Praise be to God. As I'm finishing, the prophet says something in this message, believing God, the only thing keep you from being well this morning is spirit hanging over you. The only thing keeping you dozy and feeling out of church things are boring you. I'm bored. I don't even time is not moving. Even the watch is facing the preachers. I switched off the phone. It has a you go as if you're going for short call but yet you're going to check time. He says the only thing keep you from being well &gt;&gt; this morning is spirit hanging over you that won't uh that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe promise that that he has done Every time you want to hear the word as sleep falls on you, just check your head. You try to listen to pay attention to their spirit. That's why when the song leader is here, brother be in the spirit. The song is dancing, jumping for you. You are pocketing counting the how many lives you have. You are just like this. There are spirits over you. It's not me says the prophet. &gt;&gt; He also looked through this time 2026 and see the spirit hanging over you. That is when you remember back we need to see sincerely there is a spirit hanging over you [laughter] that is right and that's then he says that won't you let you go beyond God's promiseh that is right &gt;&gt; that is what God gave me. It's it is what he give every gospel preacher who will believe him the power and authority to break that spirit. Yes. And that is why I'm rebuking that spirit. [applause] Praise be to God. That's why when ministers stand here, they don't rebuke you. They rebuke the spirit. And because you have refused to let the spirit go, you become annoyed. How dare he speaking about me? We have no business of speaking about anybody. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are our sisters, our brothers. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; But when we are here, we mind the father's business. And what is that business? Saving of souls. Rebuking evil spirit, casting them out. [screaming] Amen. Declaring the voice. the jubilee trumpet reminding you who is under bondage that is time to go free. Every preacher is given that mandate young sister or brother got that mandate to look the devil in the eyes. Tell him Satan Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; We are here to praise her. You are so nice. You are smart. Yeah, I can see everyone smiling and outs say smile for Jesus and find for Jesus. for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus want your worship. &gt;&gt; He wants your surrender, not your smile. &gt;&gt; Jesus says the time has come when the true worshippers they will worship him in spirit [screaming] and in the truth. &gt;&gt; And we are the people who have got the truth. We know when we are worshiped. [applause] You find them making a very nice prayer and they spoil everything after praying. Then they feel the name of the father, son. We know much better than that. So you always make sure that you break that spirit because you have got the mandate. There are things that we just need to think. Can't you think really clapping my hand my hands to God is wrong? Do you need a preacher to first remind you dancing in the spirit? Do you know that even when you are under chain do it anyhow even when you're not feeling like doing it do it anyway as I was telling you the pull inside us I don't think that chain broke when they sang the first their faith had to be tried and maybe that they felt when they are so dry. Have you ever been so dry to the extent that you start praying and you first stop and you speak to yourself? It has ever happened. Sometime [laughter] you wake up in the morning and you are dry at 3 in the morning. You sing the first song. Sometime I sing the first song I first seat I get the Bible I read a scripture like is not entering but I just post it anyhow I'll sing the first one it's not moving I sing the second I sing the third before I realize I am worshiping before I realize I am praying And when I engage that gear, that is a dangerous gear. Even the devil knows that say not wait for him to reach you. So many time the kingdom of God has suffer. Brother, you are going to worship God by force. will not let you worship. He will not let you sing. &gt;&gt; You have to sing by force, by faith. [cheering] Tell the devil, I will worship God. Sometime you clap, you find your hands are hurt. Those hands are not yours. Therefore, God is glory. As you are seeing them hands, you are seeing the glory of God. You have to appreciate God for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why for me when I'm woriing, I utilize this guy here. If he's jumping, I will jump. Clapping, I clap like this. If he is shouting. If it is crying, I will cry. such that tomorrow when I have a broken leg, I will remind God, give back my leg and I jump for you. Give back my arms and I clap for you. Give back my voice. I shout for you. That is what God want. But be there reserve yourself. It is the devil who is a boss. &gt;&gt; The devil, he always want to be boss. When he went to Jesus, he told him. &gt;&gt; See, maybe was very smart. Yeah, he's a smart guy by the way. So cunning, smart, handsome. The devil is not ugly. Ah it's very uh beautiful or handsome told Jesus it is given to me. Yeah just it's just a matter of because he was not whether he's the son of God or God disguising simplicity. Praise be to God. So the devil is the one who always the devil wants to to boost and lift himself. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why the Bible say God hates the spirit of pride. &gt;&gt; For me those people there &gt;&gt; they think they are spiritual. You were you were possessed. They think that that's why they cry shout for us even But if she had broken my eyes, you have a wrong spirit. David danced. You dance which can make someone's thro go down. He was in another dimension. Not this power. is not even humble that you want God to hear. You are just say here my humble pride. The Bible tells us Isaiah chapter 6. When Isaiah got the vision, he saw the angels with six wings with two wings covering their face, two wings covering their face and with two to wash and a sinner saved by grace. I am thinking of the rapture. Just saying you are thinking of jubilation. [laughter] &gt;&gt; People were going for rapture. There are more sinners than that. The Bible says their spirit cries, our father interceding whatever they are doing, they're doing with all that because they know that the table this time is not. The devil is so furious because his time is now. But believers who bewished us, we have a God, who does you just think of many things. I believe even God does surgery on those animals when they are sick. He treats them. take care of them. That is the God we are serving. We don't know how our body mechanism work. There is no engineer like God. Look at how God engineered your body. Smart. He's a smart God. Is worthy to of our praise. If you look at the way your heart system work, it's just amazing. Is worthy to be praised. There's no reason why we don't worship. You are leaving home. You are praying for one second. Father, I thank you. lead me. Are those angels your grandparents? God lead time. Father, I thank you. You've given me the grace. You have given me life. Even now as I'm moving and what is on my way kind Lord of me some reverency when we're in that kind of atmosphere there's no devil and glorify him so amen to sufficate the devil out of Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Let us always be in church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm just picking my heart. You see when you look at people who worship the devil brother, they will never miss even a single ritual. When the witch doctor tells them that every night at midnight, you go and lie on the graveyard for 30 minutes and sec and and 40 seconds. He will not miss us. He will the eyes will be on the second. But our God, it does not rule us in fear. But God want us to mean business. And the prophet tells us when we mean business with God mean business. But believers many times you see for I speak these things because since my childhood I've been in church I started on Sunday school up to today. So there's nothing that young people will tell us. probably what is more beyond in this age that there is a lot of immorality but serving moral decay but serving God being serious is mandate for every believer seeking the Holy Spirit young people I wonder what you are doing I've never heard even one saying I'm seeking the Holy Spirit Brother, I'm praying God. I want to get deeper in Christ. Maybe they go to pastor. If you are there, God bless you. How can I? You are in your holidays. You spend seven days. You want to be on church during service day. You are not working. You're not doing anything. You're at home playing chess. Can't you use that time to serve? Can't you go before the altar, where your heart is, where your treasure is, that's where your heart is. If our heart is in God, we will be on our knees. I challenge the young people. Use this time, these holy days to seek the Holy Spirit. Says, "Man does not seek God. God seeks." Why did Jesus go to the mountain? He would have sat at Joseph's house say my father you come here he went there in prayer and the reason that's why you're not praying it's because you are sinning because the sinning man will stop to pray man will stop to sin you want to stop to sin Practice prayer. Read the word. Are you listening to the message or you are reading magazine? Utilize your holidays. We want testimonies. God filling me with the Holy Spirit. I was praying, meditating on God. I was at church. I was in the bush somewhere. &gt;&gt; Yes, we used to go to bush. We used to go to Bon to abandoned houses. Me personally been to several new sites praying. Not because I'm better than anyone, but we need more of God to overcome this generation. Our God is limitless. And our prophet told us we just need to press on. But say that any believer that has got the Holy Spirit, you have you have the power of God within you or the authority to pray the prayer of faith. You hear that? But what if if you don't have the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; The son had the same authority to write a check and his dad as his dad. And if he fired a man, he was fired. If he hired a man, he was hired. Exercise your authority. Don't think chasing demons is for elders alone. No brother, even a 13y old child, even seveny old child when he or she knows what she's doing, the devil cannot stand. Don't you admire these things? Exercising authority. If you hear a demon strangling a neighbor, what's the problem? You devil, you go waste our time. Brother, &gt;&gt; don't look for brother Julius's phone number. The other scripture that says you shall cast out demons in those are your pistols. You know pistols are not meant for war. It's just for self-defense. So your self-defense are those scriptures on his name. Praise be to God. Walk with your person. You find a demon disturbing just make Those are the few pistols we move with around. God bless you [applause] precious father in the name of Jesus. We thank you Lord for this afternoon. We thank you for the word this evening. It's our desire Lord. always remind us of our duty, responsibility and of us knowing who you are that you are more than able to help us out of all our troubles. Father, even now, your word has gone forth. But prayer, Lord Jesus, said that which is not right, I pray that you uproot it, Lord. And Lord Jesus, may the Holy Spirit water your word. And may this word bring forth life in us because we know the devil does not fear us because we know how to speak. Fear us when we live the life. It's our desire for each one of us. Give us the grace to live the life of God because we cannot do without the Lord Jesus. We are depending in time. You started with us. You see us through. Father, we bless you. Worship you Christ in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Lord bless you. Shall we stand on our feet? There is a saying that all all of us know that say that action speaks louder than words. Even when we are worshiping, our action speaks louder than that. And I just believe I believe that God looks at our action and is more interested in our action than our singing. Praise be to God. I not preach to hurt anyone of you but I I trust I was just speaking the truth. &gt;&gt; God deserve our respect. Yeah. Because sometime we do things which we cannot even do to our earthly parents. But God is more more is much more than that. Yeah. May God bless you, &gt;&gt; I'm going to invite brother Shalom. But may before I invite him, &gt;&gt; we are in uh we are we've just finished our elections. &gt;&gt; And I just want to advise you brethren to kindly be careful where you go, where you are moving.
