[36:58] in jesus mighty name
[37:01] amen
[37:03] amen
[37:05] amen we take john 20 once again
[37:15] i'm happy to see you all that i've made
[37:17] it tonight my name is
[37:35] i'll probably be an hour
[37:37] uh you have to jack matters our game
[37:39] [Music]
[37:43] i do that so that
[37:45] all your attention you can give it to me
[37:54] um
[38:04] right so we're reading from verse 19.
[38:15] then then the same day at evening being
[38:18] the first day of the week when the doors
[38:20] were shut where the disciples where the
[38:22] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[38:24] jews came jesus and and stood in the
[38:27] midst and said unto them peace peace
[38:30] unto you
[38:43] foreign
[38:55] he showed unto them his hands and his
[38:57] side then where the disciples glad when
[38:59] they saw the lord
[39:10] then said jesus to them again peace be
[39:12] unto you as my father has sent me even
[39:15] so send are you
[39:17] oh yes
[39:28] and when he had said this he breathed on
[39:29] them and he said unto them receive ye
[39:32] the holy ghost
[39:54] uh as usual for your undivided attention
[40:03] so that we shall see what the lord will
[40:04] have for us tonight i want to know
[40:06] my child
[40:07] right now i mean i've
[40:24] even as if you don't have time even as
[40:25] you are walking on the road you can be
[40:27] praying
[40:31] so we find that here jesus
[40:36] he begins to speak to the disciples
[40:41] this was shortly after the resurrection
[40:46] and you know that jesus had died and
[40:48] everybody the pharisees thought that it
[40:50] is
[41:03] what the first adam failed to do
[41:16] he noticed that nothing of what he had
[41:19] created what was in his image the
[41:21] eleventh if you're never turned that the
[41:23] world watching which fought on each
[41:25] other it all came out of god beyond
[41:28] navigable it came out of the spoken word
[41:58] whereby his word can continue to create
[42:01] in that image
[42:07] an image whose word would be as good as
[42:10] god is
[42:21] hallelujah amen praise the name of the
[42:23] lord
[42:24] please you have to to do your job there
[42:27] amen so we notice
[42:30] that god after he cleared everything
[42:34] and now he had created man not on the
[42:36] moon man was in the image of god
[42:39] [Music]
[42:42] quickly go to the book of genesis
[42:44] look at me seeing thee okay named chavez
[42:47] already everyday
[42:48] and the bible says
[42:51] i believe
[42:54] verses 26 verse chapter one
[43:03] all right maybe to get a clear picture
[43:05] we can begin from verse 24.
[43:10] and god said let the earth be bring
[43:12] forth the living creature after his kind
[43:14] cattle and creeping thing and beast of
[43:16] the earth after his kind and it was so
[43:19] short
[43:30] and god made the beast of the earth
[43:32] after his kind and cattle after their
[43:35] kind and everything that creepeth upon
[43:38] the earth after thee after his kind and
[43:40] god saw that it was good
[43:50] hungarian
[44:03] but then he noticed that he had nothing
[44:05] after his kind of his
[44:19] foreign
[44:22] and let them have dominion over the fish
[44:25] of the sea
[44:28] and over the fall of the air and over
[44:30] the cattle and over all the earth and
[44:31] over every creeping thing that keeps
[44:33] upon the earth maybe our guru
[44:37] so you notice church that
[44:39] we the human race or child anti-faith
[44:43] was created for what purpose
[44:47] agenda to have dominion
[44:51] [Music]
[45:02] or anything
[45:15] and he wanted to display his name in
[45:17] them
[45:20] he never let therefore let anybody rule
[45:22] over them
[45:25] but when israel came from egypt
[45:28] on down into the promised land
[45:45] very community video but literally they
[45:47] know
[45:48] by doing that
[45:50] they were putting themselves under
[45:52] subjection of man validated
[45:56] women but they were not supposed to be
[45:57] under any money's
[46:23] [Applause]
[46:55] i have to turn that to the banjo are you
[46:57] listening to me this evening
[46:59] each of you is different
[47:02] and each of you is special in god's
[47:04] sight
[47:06] each of you was created to have dominion
[48:18] identity
[48:21] yeah we're losing that god given power
[48:25] using their authority
[48:58] the church has repressed it with the
[48:59] constitution of the church
[49:42] of the holy
[50:11] principle of a man
[50:14] and god intent
[50:16] on dying to have a bride in the end
[50:20] he will be ruled in the same way
[50:23] who will be led the same
[50:52] if it is
[51:20] supposed to be used of god but he knows
[51:23] what can i do to help you
[51:25] get into your original condition
[51:30] that is your original image
[51:32] furniture which we lost at the beginning
[51:47] oh hallelujah
[52:16] these men who
[52:58] you see a
[53:12] hallelujah
[53:40] original
[53:43] [Music]
[54:08] that
[54:08] is people who are born by believers
[54:13] we as believers thank our kids to create
[54:16] an atmosphere for them create our good
[54:18] buttons
[54:20] in our homes
[54:22] in our churches my counsel for them to
[54:24] know jesus christ
[54:27] many parents who are believers
[54:30] have thought that automatically their
[54:32] children are believers
[54:46] [Music]
[55:07] [Music]
[56:33] [Applause]
[57:24] but the way
[57:38] we
[57:50] you meet a young child with the spirit
[57:52] of witchcraft
[58:07] hallelujah he came to god yet jericho
[58:10] and suggested to god
[58:12] everything was okay
[58:20] tell me a better
[58:24] he had sacrificed his brother on a stone
[58:27] yeah yet accept muganda with ginger and
[58:30] now he was presenting himself before
[58:35] no difference for my witch
[58:38] and all of us are born with that kind of
[58:40] spirit and nature upon us and that was
[58:42] everyone who turned the way with you but
[58:44] it was not supposed to be our original
[58:47] nature
[58:48] why are you not
[59:02] desire to overcome
[1:00:01] praise the name of the lord amen
[1:00:04] and so jesus
[1:00:06] comes here after the resurrection yes
[1:00:11] praise the name of the lord
[1:00:13] and and uh just take it one hour after
[1:00:15] that i'll just quit and continue next
[1:00:17] time amen
[1:00:19] hallelujah amen after the resurrection
[1:00:21] of jesus yes

[1:01:08] he showed
[1:01:50] the hands without
[1:02:17] i was
[1:02:18] crucified international that you may be
[1:02:21] born
[1:02:23] because remember adam was taken
[1:02:25] was taken out of the east
[1:02:31] hallelujah
[1:02:32] and jesus
[1:03:14] is
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:57] who was stainless why didn't i just roll
[1:03:59] your tires

[1:05:50] and my father sent me even sustained are
[1:05:52] you sure

[1:06:17] a genitalia wouldn't be challenging it
[1:06:18] was a mold out of the ground

[1:10:08] now we see that here god comes down to
[1:10:11] speak and speak he speaks to moses
[1:10:41] you realize that before

[1:13:54] going to this land they're not driving
[1:13:56] anybody back in a museum
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:12] because they doubted it
[1:14:15] the bible says if any man asks anything
[1:14:17] of the lord
[1:14:23] let him ask without doubt
[1:15:06] god has promised to give you the holy
[1:15:08] spirit
[1:15:23] more time for you to receive the holy
[1:15:24] grail
[1:15:26] and there is nothing
[1:15:28] and i repeat that is not sin
[1:15:31] that is a child of god
[1:15:52] which god has promised them catholics
[1:15:54] but the problem once prophesied and we
[1:15:57] are doubting the promise
[1:16:00] kept on doubting their messages
[1:16:18] hallelujah amen the purpose of us having
[1:16:21] charts
[1:16:24] destruct the holy ghost

[1:19:19] if you are sick
[1:19:21] and they pray for you
[1:19:23] and you cannot get well

[1:19:27] in jesus why do we even need to preach
[1:19:29] if there is no divine healing what about
[1:19:31] you why do we need to believe in the
[1:19:32] gospel
[1:19:33] if there is no salvation
[1:19:45] you preach the gospel to become a little
[1:19:47] poor people in a corner that is so sorry
[1:19:50] to be christians
[1:19:56] do you think that this goes for god has
[1:19:58] given it to us so that he can make us
[1:20:00] feel bad in this world
[1:20:29] this gospel
