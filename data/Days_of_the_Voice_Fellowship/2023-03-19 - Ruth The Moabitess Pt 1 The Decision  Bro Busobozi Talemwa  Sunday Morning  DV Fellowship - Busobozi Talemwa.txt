him sent a text that they have gone to Russia's video today are you ready you have a microphone can you give up praise the Lord brethren Nevis I thank God I I cannot withhold my testimony I am a Trader [Music] the way we do our business is sometimes we have the capital other times we don't have it uh there are some men I worked with I wanted to buy rice and I was working with those men and I told them that I have 50 Millions but the rice which I wanted it was worth 100 Millions all of them are accepted and we work together we did everything as planned as we are calling cars to pack the rice one of the men said for me you don't pack my rice before you pay for it I tried my level best to pay that money and even another person says even my rice is not going anywhere I was really troubled the other one was demanding 17 Millions I didn't have anywhere to get that money [Music] I never remembered to go back before God for them they were saying pray that much had to go inside I prayed to God and I said Lord open my eyes so that I can see where to get money um when I called one of my children and let me try my best and see the child the young man tried his level best and deposited 17 Millions having a balance of 25 million of the total Sam for them they have ways they do their things if you don't to make them happy they don't allow you to go again and I told this brother that we are here but by the time we shall go back even this other man demanding 25 million would have changed his mind they had already brought the cars so I told the man to start packing the cars on the cars then I saw the man who was connecting us he came and told us you know things are really not easy now even the other man who was demanding 25 million he said that before you pay him you can only be here that was almost the third one we went to spend one day foreign [Music] back to court y name so I told them that offload some other rice that was six times and then I shall go much we had already deposited 500 thousands in that rice I wanted to fight my battles after talking to the man he just went out of the gate when I called him he disconnected me um he told me I got that rice from Kenya and I had paid in cash now even you won't take it without paying me in cash after remembering my God I left that place I I left the manager's office and I went where The Rice was nobody's so me apart from God I knelt on the rice and I I asked God to forgive me I've troubled these men and women because for them they paid the rice for me I don't have enough money to take all this rice I claim this rice because I've already put money I don't want to live any sack of rice here but Lord trust me as I'm in your hands when I reach town I will pay them their money after coming from my prayer and then when I came the other man was on the manager's table when I went to him he was not Angry Anymore [Music] when I'm praying to God I pray with real faith [Music] and I talked to him and then he said I've given you the rice [Applause] and he also told me that even me when I was studying I had a little money um but if your heart resembles your eyes you will not steal my mind I've given you that price I left that manager the followed me and asked me do you sell these jerrycans sucks the empty sacks which we had removed the rice and then we packed in our own side and he counted the money and paid me for those but before that he came and gave me 20 000 and apologized and said mommy this man is for lunch foreign I saw God working the man was angry almost eating his head and said apart and said mommy go and have lunch in this morning we packed all our two cars of rice we brought them and they were saying I pray for a blessing even tonight he has not disturbed us but I've already put five Millions on this account I really so good working man amen Hallelujah Amina now that God will bless you in that business and his Blessing you should bring the land fund katanda amen Nina and God should and will bless each and everyone faith we thank God for that wonderful testimony as we go through the uh to the what the money which I paid in the youth conference I'm still demanding 1.9 Millions amen amen so it was good to accept that testimony this morning because all right I have decided to follow Jesus I have as you open the Book of Ruth to follow Jesus [Music] to follow Jesus [Music] man one more time I have decided to follow Jesus well I have decided to follow Jesus Oh I have decided to follow Jesus [Music] Lord Jesus we have decided this morning in my heart I've decided father to follow you now says that oh God you come and give us inspiration utterance [Music] and let your spirit come and take control this morning [Music] you know the needs of your people you know every soul that is under this roof today foreign [Music] amen we are reading 18 verses out of the Book of Ruth so I'm starting um uh a few series uh maybe for the next five four or five Services I'm speaking on Ruth the more about us so we are reading from Ruth chapter one verse one and we'll read the uh up to verse 18 maybe let me just read in English and then you will be seated and then we can take it up from there now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to Sir John in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was admirich and the name of the wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Marlon and Chilean ephrites of Bethlehem Judah and they came into the country of Moab and continued there and early marriage now May's husband died and she was left and he had two sons and they and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was oppa and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelled there about 10 years and macron and Chilean died also both of them and the we and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband then she arose her with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had had in the country or more about how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread whatever she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah and now he said unto her two daughters in law go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as ye have dwelt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for I am too old to have an husband if I should say I have hope if I should have an husband also tonight and should also be a Sons would you Terry for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name my daughters for you to grieve with me much for your sex that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and all but kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth claved unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back to her people and unto her Goods return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said in treat me not to live thee or return from following after thee for we that thou goest I will go and whether thou largest I will load thy people shall be my people and thy God shall be my God where thou direst will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more so if out but death path thee and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her let us pray Lord Jesus I've just read a portion out of the Book of Ruth this morning this is something that took place many many years ago but we are reading them today for our example I pray that everyone will be inspired Lord and will be during the same spirit that you will minister to us I won't know it is Lucy and I'm speaking on today the decision the decision and I've lost sound so I don't know how we're doing on sound today so Ruth the more abitis and I'll be dealing with a decision Lucy um praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the name of the Lord [Music] now let us first introduce a bit to you this is going to be a little series now brother Barnum preached to one someone and he he went through it all together and he was dealing with the subject of the kinsman redeemer yeah and I would like to recommend each and every one of us here in your own time to please go and listen to the message the kingsman Redeemer that preached in 1960. how many will listen to it okay so those of you have not raised up your hand maybe don't want to make a commitment but I challenge you to go and try again yes I know you can read but it is don't have a way to to listen come to me I'll give you a way to be able to listen to it listen to the message in that message dealt with all that I want to preach in five Services [Music] we can take a few segments and have it in several services so today we will be dealing with the decision so now in Bethlehem of Judah or Bethlehem means the house of God is bread base and now me where with their three sons they were living in Bethlehem of Judah but because they are you know maybe for some reasons maybe because of femin or because of some issues they decided to leave their place and go tomorrow but what they found there in Moab was more than was more than famous it was real feminine it was death and you know as a Believer when you leave your God provided place when you leave your God is provided the place you died actually that means total separation with God and when a Believer lives their place you can never find peace with God With God when you leave your place you can never progress or succeed with God and His Assurance or his insurance we call it insurance but for him he calls it Assurance of success in life but if you go with God you will never fail totally the married wife you go with with God and you remain in your place you will always fulfill all your life's Endeavors and so I'm not going to give a big foundation I'm getting right into the summons I want you to be attentive and follow me foreign in the house where God was giving them bread [Music] but you know it is the way of the Cross is never easy the way of Christ is never easy it is a hard way full of squeezing did you die can you go it kind of like squeezes life out of you but you feel like you're losing your mind [Music] things are not going according to your unnatural plan decided with their three sons [Music] no we cannot you know hearing the message every time and here the word and you know what the past is saying no this is true no no not for us or when it is there are many people out there who are living a different lifestyle and they're happy so we can also go out there among the Pentecostals so let me go out there and live like them they decided to leave the house of God is but actually they were not happy you can never be happy when you leave the house of God is great there's so many sin you can go for them praise the name of the Lord I don't know whether it's the monster not working properly or whether brother I need more sand I can't hear myself very well and I don't want to shout so much for the people so I wanted to follow me closely here you can never find peace without God you can never progress you can never succeed let me tell you sometimes you might think let me say this if you are serpent seat no no no no no of course you will succeed with that God this morning I'm speaking today children of God do I have the seed of God here this is so I'm speaking to the seed of God this morning this sermon is not for suppancy today without being in the place that God has blessed you I told him you've lost your way and any time that a Believer gets off of his God is giving grounds and for heads up our god-given ground is the word our god-given ground is the word but anytime I believe I get stuff is god-given ground and then he says many times in politics this election coming up and so forth a good man can be a good man and he will wander off of those grounds and he will wander off into those grounds and so he says that this Minister wandered off of God's ground he said a Christian gets off of those grounds where I'll just go down tonight with the boys in the pool room I Will Do no harm I'll just take one little drink you are awful [Music] you see foreign [Music] it really types you know the blinding of the Jews but it paved away for the Gentile bride oh coming in do you understand that it also types the fall of Man that brings a savior to do the work of redemption so this story also speaks of election and Redemption I'm gonna do a lot of reading today really because I'm just giving an introductory someone for the for this series four different phrases four different phases of this Ruth [Music] says and I want to approach it from four different phases deciding Peter now she made that decision then Ruth is serving now where is that the roof is resting then the roof is rewarded and so today I'm speaking on Ruth his decision Ruth is a type of a Christianity you know the Bible is amazing and this meaning is about Christ away if you ever read anywhere in the Bible and you don't see Jesus Christ you did not read properly can you imagine to direct from the Old Testament but I'm going to preach to you Jesus because all the prophets we are testifying about Jesus [Music] foreign [Applause] foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you are representing us you are the Ambassador we have Grandma two men you are the Ambassador we have because if you're a member of this church for example you are representing us not only being a member of a church I'm talking about being a member of the church to I am fine a member of the body of Christ I told you one time when I was in Tanzania and you know someone wanted to give me to to bring me a prostitute and you're using the language I didn't understand at first it appeared as if I had accepted and so I was young I was not married yet I think I was 17 years ago and so when I got to know what the man meant yeah foreign you are a Christian when nobody's there actually for you to know that you were a real Christian is when nobody's there to see you [Applause] brother Hashem really put that sound proper now listen he says you in your behavior in the way you act and what you do you represent the entire body of Christ now [Applause] I had only a few amendments do we believe that I read it again in your behavior represent the entire body of Christ what do you say but I'm just a limited I'm not even a promise I don't even play the piano I am just a member who comes and sips and then disappears that doesn't matter when you take on that name of Christians to represent cries amen you should live like that you should live like gentlemen like ladies don't never do things of the world no matter how weak you are foreign I think this is right next year or maybe next week I can see where I'm wrong and that's how all of us are in decision making we actually never make decisions and stick with them most of the time do you want us to use other microphones okay so it says I can see where I am wrong after making a decision last year and then next year I can see or maybe next week I can see where I am wrong but God can't yeah upon the sin to act and the way he acts on that decision that's the same way you must act every time that decision has to be made again Hallelujah man talk about stability God doesn't say oh I made a wrong decision then this time let me correct Hallelujah man what does that make me feel I know he called me he made a decision to call me the new real good yeah his decision of you as the best singer if he has ever called now if he has ever been caught on a sin he will make the same decision again because if he did not if he acts a certain way on this decision remain foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign and that road map is but the problem is many times what God has purpose for you takes long to come into formations because you keep making wrong decisions now I understand you know the analogy that God has made a decision is Ultimate um your decisions because if you make the wrong ones foreign foreign amen us but God did make a way that a man could fellowship with him again and that man we was and that's the only way that God ever did meet man and that's the only way that God ever can meet man is the only way that God can meet us is under the shed blood of Jesus Christ now the way God acted or his mechanism of making decisions in the first place is always right into many people trust many things that's why I believe I must always trust God many many people Trust Systems and Society his trust is always in God for their lives I see impossibilities therefore we can predict God knowing when I was writing this I was writing it by inspiration I was like ah we can predict God whenever knowing what will happen when we do what foreign foreign foreign you will do the same thing he did in the past hallelujah amen so what he did before to others he will do to us we made the same condition those people met us yes Hallelujah I mean you can never say that was rude [Music] what he did for them he will do for you if you do what does people think what did Ruth do the first thing who's decided hallelujah amen he is the same God and he never changes we always have to make decisions after being inspired right hallelujah amen that's why he gives us his word to inspire us the right way too so that we can make the right decisions that's why we come to church foreign [Music] [Music] so she was like foreign [Music] Hallelujah amen you feel life already over them you feel life how many feet what is that checho that is the seed of God in you yes on Tuesday Wednesday because we are living in Two Worlds at the same time that's why I believe you must keep yourself under the altar foreign foreign if you have a preacher and you tell them that's the first thing that's the first thing the first thing takes in natural marriage is a decision has to be made the young lady has to make her decision so even a young lady makes a decision in a marriage the young lady has to make a decision whether she wants this young man and whether the young man whether he wants this young woman there has to be a decision made and he says and you have to make it he says and you have to make it makes it for you you make it go away now so this portion goes to the unmarried especially those who are planning to get married you make that decision she must be the only woman in the world and he must be the only man that you love if it is people think that it is emotion and feelings that's not what we're talking about love is subjective doesn't have God in it it's not true love that is just to say if you love an unbeliever it is most likely that that's not true because it was not inspired right so it must be a true love foreign rest of my life whether to serve God and to take him as yourself you see it's not only taking him as a savior it's also serving him being an ambassador back away are you going to serve the world are you going to serve Christ oh now it is you have to make up your minds of you there has to be a decision man when you make up your mind are going to serve God to gain away with the cartoon oh you're going to serve mammals then you take your choice but the decision has to be made Hallelujah man when I was 13 years that's why every a decision I met I decided to filter it through the choice if I'm going to get a job my first question is foreign testimony and I'm like I don't know what my wife will think but but she said I don't know what you were thinking part of our courtship we never talked about you know sexual stuff but did you really love me from the beginning but I thought I wanted to be sure I was making the right choice you are going to be the woman that I want to marry your mother for my children and I could not have been sure when I went into love stories foreign how can you love somebody don't know you have to love somebody that you know love comes out of a relationship Hallelujah love comes out of knowledge love comes out of Revelation Revelation is this much I am making 10 years in marriage can you believe that um [Music] foreign [Music] advising you today don't rush actually younger girl if a brother and begins telling you how beautiful and how they love you so much and how they can sleep most likely that is in the first week how possible something wrong you see that it comes out of a relationship you are not marrying a feeling remember this is someone who has been raised by somebody else you believe maybe there's different things what's up no Amen on that it's your it's a lifetime companion you've man up your mind before you go into love things begin with finding out who they are what do they intend to do in life let me go back to myself and then after the decision is praise the name of the Lord you've got to make an engagement before this Union can be and that's the way it is with crisis Church it has to be an engagement with Christ I pledge oh the message is sweet tonight you must have a love affair with Jesus hallelujah amen love is the best thing in the world see of course if you don't you don't love or if you've not Been Loved Before You Can't Understand and the prophet is telling us it's a love affair with him and then the next thing is promises like that you make promise sweetheart you will marry me I promise I'll be the lawyer and I'll be loyal and true I will look upon no other woman I look upon and the woman and I will do all that his duty as a duty as a wife we have children I will do it as a duty as a mother housekeeper all these promises us to God to be married and that's the same thing when you come to Christ if you will receive me I promise I will love you I'll be true [Music] so what what you've promised Jesus Christ why would it be so easy for you to take a job that gives you 5 million a month and yet you know you're not going to attend any services uh with going to church am I preaching to someone you only stream okay if you're far away and maybe your quota um but streaming cannot be replaced with going to church streaming the services [Music] I think I'll finish with this quote as I feel as I'm still in the same court but let me read on down a few more minutes it says look here if you haven't got teeth and you use false teeth no and you use false teeth now that's all right but it's substituting for teeth that you was hard it is substituting for this you are for the teeth you once had um but actually those teeth are not connected with you how many of you here have mechanical teeth nobody yeah all of you have no motives listen who did that you see but it says if of course not they already had they already saw where I was going so they didn't want to claim that yeah but actually those trees are not connected with you it's not a part of you if you had an arm amputated and you put a false armor no take a cookware that arm is actually not connected with you it's not connected with you and when we take our pledge to Christ if we don't become a part of him like a woman all to become a part of a man and a man a part of the woman then we are an artificial Christians foreign foreign a D Catholic Muslim but really because their father was but you're not that 38 oh come on you're not that it's a security you're just a denominational child but but God wants to make you his child away he wants to be connected with you and you do that only by believing the word you repent of your sins you accept Christ as your personal sins in the name of Jesus Christ the Forgiveness of sins and then you were given the Holy Spirit and then the Journey Begins if the woman isn't connected with a man in trueness then it is at her husband is just a man she's taking a vote to live with oh yeah she played to love him she said she loved him but if a man you want to know that you you married the right woman this is a woman who must be willing to give her entire life to you to some extent I felt that women may be loved more than men [Music] foreign now that's true and when you do that right decisions praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord if the woman isn't connected with the man in trueness then it is just a man she's taking a vow to live with champ like to love him and she said she loved him all the time the man is deceived if she doesn't does what she promised all the time if the woman doesn't do it all the time there is one thing sure friends are you ready for this we are not going to deceive Christ he knows his own Hallelujah man but you see first decisions Hallelujah okay I'm just right on my time here I wanted to finish that quote but there is another portion I know you promised me that you are going to listen to the kinsman redeemer this is who did not raise up their hand let me read you this portion also and getting towards America and then we'll Brothers prepare to sing the song I would like us to sing the song all the way now there's this portion in in the Kingdom Matthew you can give us that says but oh how I like that little Ruth she had to make a decision I had to make a decision you've got to make a decision you will never work out those these doors this morning without some kind of decision let me let that sink you will not leave this room today either being a better man or a woman or a worse man or a woman Obama said as I was reading this I thought the Holy Spirit just spoke to me and said that happens every Saturday whenever anybody doesn't matter who singsongani if you walk into the church where the true word of God is preached you walk out better or worse than you oh follow me he says you to reject it you will be worse it will be harder the next time for you to get to it or you will go out better it becomes a showdown in her life it comes a showdown in everybody's life and Ruth how to make a decision does the Bible says go back to your denomination go back to your sin the area of the video go back to the lukewarm you know go back like the lukewarm did die young foreign young people who are here did you know that some of you didn't know that um churches are communities which I accept everybody foreign [Music] [Music] I am convinced it's the truth is that we made it good day I'm looking forward to that means but don't you worry while we're here we are struggling two hours three hours oh I am thankful I'm not a long preacher but I'm also struggling to become a one-hour preacher we should preach for 40 minutes but why do we do sometimes two hours three hours because we are struggling the world is giving us more than three hours out there movies one hour and a half three two three minutes the devil keeps you entertained the First Book Festival where are you scroll and scroll down I deleted that thing on my phone I don't need VPN so I got a VPN I deleted it because the thing was making me busy even you lose your time and now on Twitter they are the ones who decide for you what to see so you will receive videos [Music] oh goodness the devil has made sure he has kept us busy at whatever you couldn't entertain yourself but we don't have time for church anymore oh God help us but what do we need today that's why sometimes when we come to church I have to tell you this sometimes as a preacher you say Lord I want to just speak for 40 minutes normally a person does not listen for more than that and you know they're getting tired you made your decision but holy spirit says maybe there was somebody that needed it foreign it's not about TV that's why as Believers we hate that thing we heard it we don't like it it's not about TV done to me there's nothing wrong with it what they're offering me what they're offering my babies dressed naked everywhere they flip channels but you said Channel things that are rated for uh for a six-year-old you find that stuff that is our children we have to make such decisions when my wife and I got married we went to Nairobi there was a brother who had a TV broadcast TV programs very nice program no no I went to Nigeria and I just want another Pastor who had a TV of his own almost very good programs I came back I said to my wife I think we can benefit from one we agreed so we vote I think it is put the dish up on our house and we were enjoying it at first we were enjoying them the programs and then you know the other program in Nairobi programs in Nairobi and then slowly by slowly slowly the other programs and then one day we noticed we started going to church late a believer [Music] [Music] thank you foreign thank you I went to Kenya I went to Ethiopia Ethiopia on a trip and we're praying and the Holy Spirit spoke to me directly when you go back home foreign [Applause] you don't need a TV to watch news foreign they are all evils this one is even worse than a TV but at least you have a level of control you can tell them I don't want to see this whatever it's about this block if you watch bad stuff on your phone you're about to begin with yourself but friends I am so thankful neighbors by the time my children came in my home I didn't have zuku influencing them the decisions am I preaching to believe us today come on let us stand as I read this other portions says Ruth said I will go where you go again your people who will be my people are going to be my God I will die that's a real decision Lord I'll take you as my savior if the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of our Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ if the Bible said I must receive the holy ghosts if the Bible tells me Jesus Christ is the same yesterday done forever I will take the Bible on God for what he has written what he is Cherry no matter what anybody else prayer is the real truth that's the real Ruth foreign go back or go forward but the prophet says don't never go back let's go forward how many want to go forward may God help us to go forward make that decision [Music] all the way I'm going all the way in the muscle
