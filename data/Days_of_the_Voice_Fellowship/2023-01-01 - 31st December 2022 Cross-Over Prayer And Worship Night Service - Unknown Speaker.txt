crossover moment as we cross from 2022. [Music] it's a privilege Lord because we are not here alone actually now you said you were so ever two or three are gathered in my name is father I believe no need is going to leave [Music] coming back in the vowel lights God by what we say they will live happy they will live rejoicing again because they've carried all their abundance to you they will leave it here thank you Jesus nobody is many I in many other places but we want to be in your presence father even as we will take moments to share uh your word that you'll come and speak to us in Jesus name [Music] amen I mean praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord while you're still standing let us first read the scripture then you'll get seated we are reading two verses out of Hebrews 12. together [Music] praise the name of the Lord foreseeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the rest that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God amen [Music] you may be seated I trust that everyone will find a chair we have two chairs in front here so don't remain standing Hallelujah Hallelujah this evening I'm not going to be lengthy foreign it's it's always been worth it imagine God bless you for the song services um we have many people who are going to testify today and all our ministers will at least give us through us a word or two minutes would like to testify and other sisters who have also testimonies we will open for that after we have crossed over to the new year but I just wanted to give you a new year message in just a little over about five words do the best you can foreign basically I'll just give you a story of a man maybe you've heard of it before or not and atrocity will be a blessing to you but you have had a weekend of meetings this past weekend weekend at the convention those who miss you really missed a lot [Music] this is Joel right yeah so then I end up calling just because that is much better for me I don't confuse the first names but this is [Music] because they are studying in different places so I'm happy that you were here happy that each of you is here for yourself each and every one of you and I'm also happy that my mother is here Mommy I love you so much foreign we have testimonies every one of us tonight later everyone has a time to give their tests praise the name of the Lord do the best you can collect your natural there's a lot that you might have done this past year and you did not do it now you know because all right now you did not do it not because you did not want to do it [Music] um I'm just requesting not to be interrupted you did not do it not because you do not want to do it because the secret language but maybe because time run out we just have 46 44 minutes I think 54 minutes and in those minutes uh and I'm waiting for you while speaking to finish because our deacons you did not time this properly I mean you're supposed to do that earlier usually when we are getting into the preaching of the world we should not we should always ensure that the preacher is not interrupted because it spoils the atmosphere and we say Amen to that mean so are we all in the same speed 100 percentage of your neighbor are you in the same space all right so let us now be in the spirit of the world because I'll be a few minutes praise the name of the Lord so time run out on you or would they say in 52 minutes it will now no longer be 2022. [Music] to accomplish your goals but I am not talking about what your failures have been this past year foreign [Music] and so he wanted to drink away his problems but for the children of God the way we see things is not the way the world now for the year that is coming I want I want to just give you one phrase do the best you can college is but I want to tell you something if you've not attained Christ you have lost your God because you can gain the whole world if you don't have Christ you have lost it all your numbers that is why it is important to always have and spend time with God many many people who were thought to be Mighty very last minute of their life we asked for time alone with God just one minute or two along with God what do you think that would change do you think that the Rapture is going to just happen on people and take them by surprise [Music] forget about that if you're waiting you know some of us love surprises I remember there is a day I came back from Ethiopia and I surprised my family and they saw me at church Wednesday evening my wife knew that I was coming I'm not even my children they were surprised but that's not how it is Jesus is not going to surprise anyone agenda Nissan the ones who are going to be surprised but the ones who are going are already being raptured now they are being changed slowly and and The Virgins the five foolish and the five ways all of them were virgins but the other one who did not have the oil when they cry in the middle of the night like this time when they cry went out okay [Music] which we know that that's the shout that's the The Voice the the voice of the message of the Lord will sound foreign please Papi we would want to give you what we have now you get to this enough for us we cannot share with you the twins are governing more to themselves and buy for yourself now I wish I have a hard time I would preach on that Singham the oil is the Holy Spirit and if you believe the word titled to receive the Holy Spirit every service we have been doing all we can to collect your nature someone has been piling up the Lord has been eating the world foreign and you have spent it before the presence of God I want to tell you it is not in vain it's not in vain is not in vain [Music] as runners in this race of life [Music] God has helped us and we have reached the finishing line of 2022. we have run but not alone we have run with Christopher fighting together amen Amina but also we are ship and a sheep we are fed on the world put it there we have grown from 2020.00 I'm no longer what I used to be Hallelujah man I am not what I want to be like I used to be yeah you are not yet what you want to be a move by the way we should be careful of whatever I'm saying here today [Music] [Music] and we have believed by the word gambo onto another yeah and as the bride of Christ we are getting to know Christ in a deeper way amen you know you know Christ but we should do the best we should not give up I'm just sharing those few words [Music] and I want to share like I said I promise I want to share the story of a man called and his name is not Von winkled how many of you have ever heard of the country called Switzerland street is the land now this man was in the making of this country I'll take a quote from the messages since I'm not going to preach for long I believe this testimony will stay with you for the rest of this holiday here not long ago in Switzerland when a banker sit down standing up there in the big high Alps mountains I was thinking of Arnold Von wikri cities many of you know the story another story of this man yeah quickly one um okay only one here another story I mean um what a gallant hero he was many years ago in Switzerland the Swiss nation was being invaded by a mighty Army are the cities were being taken and the girl and blood of the Swiss people congregated from the mountains into the valley cities [Music] with such little weapons as they could defend themselves and when they stood there on the field and they looked approaching them and when they were approaching this great army they were outnumbered [Music] the enemy was 50 for them they were once again and there were the words and soldiers but this Army that was invading was well trained like a brick wall coming right [Music] and when they were standing there with their Spears [Music] one great man stepped out um as he stepped out there in the presence they were hopeless everything they could think of was lost I'll give my life for Switzerland and the homelands and he said what will you do he say down in the valley under now he's a lovely little home where my wife and little children are waiting for me to come back foreign Cola [Applause] [Music] as we are beginning this year the determination you may not be a preacher should be a good singer but you have something to do the kingdom of God Amen and he said fight with what you've got one imagining how he was speaking do everything you know those soldiers when they're going to fight this man knew this was in front of him that's why we believe in screaming because they believe in doing the best way foreign [Applause] praise the name of the Lord and he went right to us the sickest of the Spears and when he got right down to where they were married the last time and he grabbed big harmfuls of those Spears now foreign and today later you can mention his name in Switzerland and their eyes will color with tears and their cheeks will flash for their Heroes that was one of the greatest heroes of my opinion that's been in my life but that's just a minor thing foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign Jesus has broke the ranks of the devil yes [Music] praise God Mighty Wind fell out of the heavens every man with a weapon the Holy Ghost has armed each and every one of us are telling you what you can do this coming years you are armed with a weapon or the nature hallelujah amen you are armed with a weapon what
