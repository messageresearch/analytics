amen amen I would like to greet each of you tonight in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ uh turn to your neighbor and tell them welcome to the house of the Lord some people are just looking around go to tell them welcome in the house of the Lord amen you may be seated for a [Music] moment uh yes I think it was uh today is Friday uh I believe it was yesterday th when I received communication from uh one of my of our friends J and uh he informed me that U there is a a Vista that he has a brother a pastor from uh Zambia and he wanted to know whether we had a service on Friday so that he can also come and be a blessing to us here so I told him unfortunately this Friday we don't have a service and I told him about our home Cale program that we have on on Friday we supposed to be doing the cell and also Brother Martin was supposed to minister in Miana Road and um so I thought should we just have the guest you know come to benefit only those of us who will be in in that area I felt we would be selfish so uh we there decided to invite everyone who can be able to make it to church this evening to come and be a part of that blessing isn't that wonderful and um he you the minister was supposed to begin ministering about 30 minutes ago but I was informed by uh Pastor Jess they caught up in traffic but I should be here any time from now amen um God bless you for your sacrifice to just um you know leave whatever that you are going to do to be in the presence of God this evening I believe that that the Lord will bless you amen so we will just um sing a few songs and maybe go in prayer a little bit as we I I have a few prayer requests I want to give you so that while we wait for the minister we can be able to pray over those things uh I know there most of our brothers and sisters that are not here are streaming online stream [Music] online and so uh today I had communication with Bethany High School I have good news and bad news high school and so Bethany told me okay we're waiting because we we had communication we're writing each other and uh regarding our youth come and so um the last communication we had was we were requesting we were agreeing to their terms and we are requesting them to tell us the names to which we shall write the check yes because they wanted us to make at least a 50% payment so I waited Monday no response Tuesday Wednesday so today I said let me let me call the school find out why they have not responded to us and uh this gentleman tells me oh you didn't receive the letter Pastor I said no we did not re said no the teacher wrote a letter and asked the receptionist to get in touch with the church and so we thought you had received it so he said but anyways I'll take you through I'll brief you then they say well our school um is in some kind of agreement they have they in a contract agreement [Music] with for I think a number of years to be doing to be for to be marking from their school and and so he said we did not receive communication from you year and we certainly thought they're not coming but even if they were coming we thought they will mark up to maybe November 7th I mean January 7th that was our expectation they and uh so but inally they're telling us they'll be marking up to 18th January and so I was told I'm sorry Pastor you cannot have your event and also have uh your nebor at the same school I told them come on you can't mean that on the last minute this is a big event they said but we are in a contract with you we did not mean to disappoint you uh but it is just something that is beyond us and we are sorry but we cannot host you this year I felt the way you are feeling now but I spoke with my wife and um at that moment um I um prayed in my heart and the Lord spoke to me uh and put a specific place in my heart that I should go check out immediately so I called Brother Martin I told him Brother Martin I gave him the information that I've given you and I said so this is what is happening um we don't he felt bad of course uh and I can hear everybody silent that's how myself and brother martin were uh but then I told him there is this place that the Lord has placed in my heart as soon as I received the news uh I'd like us to go check it out uh before we check out other places because the PDN the one we had this year it is presumed that another church will be doing their camp this year there year probably around the same dates so I went with Brother Martin to that place that the Lord had laid on my heart and um probably many of you know it uh we will announce it as soon as we we have concluded if there are anything to conclude with them so when we reached there when we arrived there the this man the gentleman is a professor they the one in charge of the of the whole facility he was he looked as if he had met us before he was so excited oh you're welcome and I had my heart with a round cap and so when I was greeting him I remove it he said Oh I thought you were a very old man I said I'm old in my room my [Music] right well he said okay you're welcome so we went in his office and he was very happy and very receptive how can I help you so we talked about what we want help it's um an institution so we we told him what we were we're planning a youth camp and blah blah blah these [Music] days do you have enough facilities he said let me take you around and uh so he was just very happy I mean I was impressed so uh so he took us around so when we saw the hall the first place we saw I even wondered why we had not seen that place being so close to us um almost in the same distance like Bethany this side so um we you know he showed us the hall the hall h is big and more beautiful than even Bethany and uh so we we took us to the hostels very good very well established took us the kitchen and um they said the chairs we have even tens of thousands um screens you know wey talking about brothers bringing their screens and things he said we have plenty huge screen is a a technological Institute so we were so impressed um and so we went and sat down with him in the office and uh he said so gentlemen how much would you like to offer us each of the days you going to be here so we told him you tell us how much would you want us to pay well he said you're going to be here for three nights he said tell us he said tell us tell me how much would you like to pay you already welcome we have given you the place um so just tell us how much you want to pay and I mean the whole thing did not look so real it was so fast and and so we told I looked at B Martin I told him they asked us about 9 million something so we counted how much a day million a day okay so let's tell him 1 million a day Brother Martin told me that is so little she may not accept so he said uh I said okay maybe if if it is 1.5 okay fine but let us begin uh I told him let's begin with a small amount um I I so he said okay so gentlemen how much will it be uh have you thought about it I told him yes we want to pay 1 million a day and I was very serious he said that's a good offer 3 million that's a good offer it's a good offer but how about you add 1 million and uh you make it four Millions [Music] overall and we give you all these facilities for the three days we did not answer because it sounded so unreal and I'm speaking it here publicly because I want us to pray God is up to something the devil is up to something but God is up to something God always beats the devil at his own game when the devil thought he had won that's when God shows her and he proves I'm in this I'm on your side and so this gentleman so we kept quiet as in approval and then we uh he said well write a letter address it to our institution and from your church request uh for for you to come and use our facility and so we will consider it uh I told him you will have the letter as soon as tomorrow and the only down on that place is the is the um air conditioning but he said the room the hole is so large you don't need we told him we need it so he said I'll talk with the directors and we see we see whether we can do something friends if this turns out to be the place we shall use already on our budget it means God has already paid for us 5 [Applause] million because you remember we we had a budget of 35 37 and we made an average of 35 million we pledged the the the the committee the committee of the brothers the organizing committee PL 5.5 million and um last Sunday the church pledged 1 I think 45 so we were remaining with about is it 13 million if the math is correct so so that without knowing where it will come [Music] from where the 13 million because that is remaining it's unpledged and know where it will come from but if they have if they have declined us to use this place and God has opened a door for that new place at that amount a better place at that amount it means already the budget has reduced by 5 million so that's why I'm asking you that we should pray sometimes when God does things you may ask God for something and God may turn it down and then you think God has forsaken you but you see when the devil thinks he has won that moment is when God shows her and he does something that you even never imagine something that you even never thought of and friends I want to tell you I believe God is in this God is with us uh this burden came from the Lord and He will supply both the venue the perfect venue for us and the money that we need and even the ministers that are going to come to minister uh we believe that God will uh God has already orchestrated everything plann it all out and our way is not his way but his way is perfect as long as we know we are we are standing on behind his vision then he is standing behind with us and he's behind whatever we are doing and so we should pray and believe that the Lord is with us Sister Jesse we happy to see you God bless you and uh you you came in late but I just mentioned I don't know whether you were following online were you no so we're just saying that Bethany they saying your neb is going to be marking from there and then here we get a better place just for even 5 million is cheaper I say God is with us and he will sustain us through all so let us stand um um and um just sing and pray I would like us to pray for this Youth Camp and pray it's an opportunity that God has given us together here like this so we can also be able to do that pray for our youth come pray for the ministers uh Pastor chosi as you know uh is a um he mentioned to us that he may not after all make it because he's not yet back to preaching but there is a another Minister that um I I am talking with with pastor chosi and him to replace him in case is not able to make it we want to commit all these things to the Lord that God will have his way can we sing that again Lord I Need Your Touch again and each of us will just go for a moment of prayer as we wait on the ministers to arrive Lord I

may share your word in Jesus name we pray amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord God is good as the Pastor said pastor Jess may God bless him he's such a wonderful servant of God I shared with him the puppet inam as he said and from there I was on my way to Uganda but I only reached now on my way back I met his sonin-law from the pastor in Nairobi and from that time we have been interacting then I F the pool because my heart is for the lost soul especially reaching out in the areas so I F the pool to visit so when I was coming I said I cannot just go to without seeing P so that's how I came to him then and on my way back may God bless the servant of God of God have opened the door to preach puet is something that we must regard Jal because it's from here where you can kill the church or build the church so may God bless you to open the door but I pray according to the grace I will not disappoint you God bless you let's go straight into the word of God Matthew Chapter 7 [Music] uh we'll start reading from verse 21 then go through up to 23 the Bible reads not everyone that say unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doth the will of the My Father which is in heaven many will say unto me in the day Lord Lord have we not prophesy in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye workers of iniquity m may the Lord are the blessing to the leading of his word you may be SE um I want to share with the sense of the Living God on the message I've entitled doing the will of God doing the will of God many of the times people tend to misunderstand sometimes fail to Define what the will of God is even me I've been there for some time every time when somebody ask me are you doing the will of God and to my own understanding and this is the general understanding the religion C what always comes to the mind of a Believer or a worshiper doing the will of God they say is to praise God to do good things to be kind to people to serve God and all good thing that you know and that's what people know but one day when I was going through the scripture when the Lord Jesus said many on that day many not few but many who come to him did we not do this and that I was a good man Lord I helped the needy I helped my neighbor I did this and that Hallelujah and that's what people think it is the will of God but I want to tell you sense of the Living God being good is not a qualification for you to enter the kingdom of Hallelujah Hallelujah and God is not interested for people to become good this is what religion has done many people millions of people to become good people yet they are not doing the will of God yes many people and one day I shocked the Saints in that I've ceased myself to call a Believer I've stopped calling myself to be a believer then the old church was silent hallelujah hallelujah yes I don't call myself to be a believer because even the is a Believer do you know that the scripture tells me if you say you believe you but the devil also is a Believer I prer myself to be a Christian because believer they make you to become a religious person all believers if you are not care you find yourself into the group of religion and God is not interested in ReliOn God is interested in the sons and daughters so uh I want to talk about the will of God what is the will of God what is the will of of God the prophet one time preached on the message that is possible to serve God outside the will of God very possible and you may be very sincere and you must be sincerely have a good testimony such that even the neighbors they able to say this person is a good man this person is a good truly is a Christian you have all those qualities you are not a daughter of Son of God so should we stop doing good things no but we should not look on those things because good things should be just a nature of a good of of a child of God should not be the thing that we must begin to [Music] possess that's what religion has done they force people to begin to possess good things we should never begin to possess good things we must produce good things possessing good things and the only thing that can make you and me to produce good things to know the will of the father hallelujah hallelujah the Lord Jesus Christ here is telling not anyone that say Lord Lord enter the kingdom of God but those that do the will of the father and he went on saying many will say to me that day which day the day of judgment hallelujah hallelujah that day many people will say and these many people our religion people our religious people our worshippers people who have invested so many things they have invested their time they have invested their money will sacrifice everything in the name of worshiping God expecting to enter into kingdom of God I want to tell you people who don't who are not believers they know where they going and they will not come to complain to God people who come to complain to God you and me if we fail to know the will of God if you fail to know the will of God this is why I am a firm believer in Miracles because I believe in the manifestation of the power of God but this does not give me plight to be the child of God because even just on the disciples when he sent them they went there and perform signs and wonders and they became very they became back excited then he said don't be happy because demon has submitting to you but be happy when your names are written the book of and for your name and my name to be written in the book of life is not until we know and do his will hallelujah hallelujah you know many uh denomination people they believe much in good things and when the Lord revealed to me to come and understand the will of God unless God inspires me very I preach about evil things very I tell people to stop drinking very I tell people to condemn what they do because I came to realize that doing so is to make hips of religious people when somebody know the will of God tomatically all those evil attributes and acts will stop God created man on his own image and he wants man to live eternal life but sin came in and this is why job came out strongly that any man born of a woman as few days so let me tell you this becoming a good person does not save you from being a sinner you can be good person but remain a and go to hell with good testimonies with good goodness with all your kindness so you become a good sinner going to was a good sinner Hallelujah why because you felt to understand and do the will of the Father the will of God I always tell people it's very simple there are not many things as many religious people they call them do the will of the father that's why God says the will of the Father the will of the Father the will of God is for you and me who was born of a woman born a sinner must come to a place where we must be born again hallelujah hallelujah we must come to a place where we must be born again and one thing that the devil has donee to the message of the hour the devil has made us to become limited because we have the Revelation that Jesus is God and we have the true baptism and we have the true message and we end there that it's okay as we are believers we are not like denominations like other churches as we have the truth I have received the true [Music] baptism my sister my brother you just become a good person and it to be painful this is why the Bible says they IGN death and cry and weep they we gr tee you know why spend after spending all your life some of you were born in the family of Believers you grew up in the message and you spend all your denying the old things and in your heart you conclude that I am a believer yet not born again yet not born again Hallelujah because I I don't I don't believe if we can tell a born again if we can force a born again to do the good things I don't think so because I posted a question one day to the church that who teach te say a cheek to scratch on the ground who teaches the cheek to scratch they answered me that it is the the mother I told them that no what about those Brothers take them without mothering that all day we find that then they were quiet let me tell you it's the nature of a chicken the reason why people sing because they were born of a man and everyone who is born of a man is born of adamic Nature and the nature of Adam is the nature of sin whether you are a good person or not you still remain a sinner yes you are just a good sinner that does not qualify you to become the child of God this is why Jesus told Nicodemus I tell you the truth unless one is born again canot see the kingdom of God so the will of the father is for everyone to be born again Hallelujah because the message of Born Again has pressed the Pentecostal of misused it and the end time we have not understood it fully we think that when we believe and we got the true baptism and we have the message we believe in the prophets and we think that it's okay this is why we have Bunches of traditional Church in [Music] the that's why we have the dead churches claing to have the truth but there's no life of God this why find that they diving each other fighting one another because they look to each other's enemies why because they still can because the works of the flesh are manifested yes you may not commit you may not steal but you may have a threat Hallelujah not still may not commit doubt all things but the flesh is still in you you will still be feel bit [Music] against one time I was in the ministerial meeting and I was talking about the stature of the perfect man and the prophet there outlined and there were brotherly kindness brother love and the love of God but I want to tell you brother love it's okay but it's not perfect brotherly love is so good but it's not perfect the only perfect love love because AAP love has no limit no condition I told them that at Brothers if you cannot love me as your brother if you say you are children of God just love me as your enemy because the Bible tells me so you have you have wa love your neighbor your enemies but I tell you love your enemies pray for your enemies when the enemy come and ask something from you that is a so if you cannot love me as your brother love me as your enemy then you prove to me that you are the son amen now to love is on those who are in the will of those who are born of to have the love of God my brother my sister my fellow servants we can teach the church to love one another they will never have the perfect love not until people are born of God then they are going to have the nature of God in them because Love Is God and if you don't have God you just pretend that you love your sister you love your but inside you the flesh is hitting you up because you are still because in you there's no nature of [Music] God to be born again Nicodemus turn to Jesus how could it be me I'm an old person should I go back to my mother's born again he said no no no no I'm telling you unless one is born over of the spirit so having a true baptism in does not qualify you to be a child of God that is just one step it's just a step you must go through all the processes the prophet preached in the message of birth pain he explains how bir in natural and he Mak it a comparative to the spiritual and he said that any B is a Mery to be born again is a today we have Smart Believers smart Believers civilized Believers when they are coming before the presence of God they are saying Lord forgive me you know what I've done you are so merciful Forgive Me Lord but I want to tell you is a [Applause] Mery hallu you must expose yourself Hallelujah we must expose ourselves let me tell you yes we are in this body do you know why came by religion CLS this is a type of religion God did not created man with CRS so when you are coming to God EMP yourself before God every secret that you have this is why pastors we don't see people receiving the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost knows us better you may cry feel me Lord but I tell you what ERS many Believers from receiving the Holy Ghost is UNC confessed sin they have become religion covering themselves my brother my sister is a hallelujah hallelujah that's why when you see the P of God the process of God for people to be born again alus did not go deep in detail to explain but the apostles expl explain it details Peter on the day of Pentecost it them that he repent what comes first before what baptism is repentance then be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus every one of you for what for remission of your sins then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost repentance genuine repentance exposing all the secrets whatever sin that you have committed in the priv you expose them then you receive the baptism then you a c receive the Holy Ghost H when you receive the Holy Ghost you are born again hallelujah hallelujah the prophet said there must be justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost and he typed it to the Natural in LA comes first is water blood then a child life so the life of God only come upon a Believer who has genuinely repented expose all the secrets not say Lord you know yes he knows but he want you to expose look one day are you telling that Jesus CH did not know because he was God he has the discernment that woman who touched if he wanted going to point her there but he wanted her to come out and confess she said immediately when I touched your Closs my issue was stopped meaning she was healed but not but not but when Jus came out she said daughter your faith has made you whole not your faith has healed you but has made you let me tell you my brother my sister being healed and being completely whole two different things let me show let me demonstrate being healed you have the H here then when it is healed it will leave a m but being whole disappears being all the mar disappears this is why God says you you make you as if you have never seen because he has made you you have not just become a religious person you have become a child of God Bible tells me so that we know whoever born of God not because the evil one touches him not why because all Sons and Daughters of God are truly Born Again are I made this is why it's very possible many people will come because they have never been there they have never been born again they have never been born of God they they don't have the life of God my brother my sister if you are still struggling with last you are just a religious person you are not a child of God yes if you cannot control your temp then you are not still born again you are still in flesh yes the flesh can you can lose temper but you cannot go on with temper why the one in you who defr the temple the one in you will defate the temple you're going to have the life of God and the nature of God he has got so many attributes but the nature of God is one and his nature is [Music] love hallelujah hallelujah his nature is love so if we can have the nature of God let me tell you the attributes of God can be counterfeited but his nature cannot be counter Miracles can be counter signs and wonders can be countered speaking T can be countered but the nature love can never [Applause] be much I believe in the power in the manifestation of the power Spirit one time we were attacked with a certain sister Hallelujah she spoke well we were in the conversation that was in and again she interpreted and they all wor conv they say oh spirit of God but when I went back to my room the Lord showed me this is in a vision she's eating res and snakes then I said I woke up I started praying in the morning we went again for another conf for another meeting it was a three days conference she were praying again she break up then God break me also into the vision and God showed me her life she was a prostitute yet spoke Tong and interpret clearly and the whole conion glorify God yet this Tong and interpretations is coming from a prostitution then I asked the the one who's in charge of the conference I want to speak to that sister in the presence of a Deon we went in the room when I started speaking to her trying to interview her demon manifested the Deacon was shocked how possible the one was speaking T and interpreting the T here again the pastor just interviewing demons we cast it out then I told her your life is not okay s then she confessed after confession that Tong and interpretation hallelujah what am I trying to say all these things they are good things but they are not priorities the priority is for you to have the spirit of God in when you have the spirit of God in you you become the daughter and son of God before you know before you know you begin to produce the character of God the of God before you know that last you haveen that bitterness you have vanish away before you know why because the one has born who was best have given who has born you is in [Applause] let me tell you what the devil has done to the church when I'm talking about the church is the Believers in the en these are just religious these are other are just religious because we believe the prophet and I was shocked one man was saying once you believe once you are baptized in the then you have the message automatically you have the then I said no if that's the truth if what you believe is the truth then you don't understand their 10 virgins they were 10 five were wise five were foolish and both of them all of them they had lamps and all their lamps trimming their meaning the light to light to show the light to light the love to light they had the oil but the wise they had despair I want you to understand what it means the message itself it's anointed that's why when you have it you may feel that you have the Holy Ghost no that light is coming direct from the lamp it is coming from direct from what from but you as your heart you have the vessel In Your Vessel must also be oil as much as the the the lamp is showing light surviving from its oil its own oil but you must out the vessel Vel they must be it's not the oil which was in the lamps which made the wise to sustain their the day no it was the oil in the vessel so it's not the holy spirit in the message it's not the power that the message carries you must have your vessel and In Your Vessel must be full of when the two meets when the two meets you survive all night weeping endure the night but joy comes in the morning when you have oil in a vessel don't un surviving on the anointing of the message that's what people they believe when you have the the message you have the spirit no you must have the vessel and you are the vessel you are the vessel you are the vessel then in that vessel be filled with oil when the trumpet sound the Midnight Cry they thed they discovered oil is not enough they ah there's nothing of sharing my anointing to there's nothing you must have your own no we can't share just go and find when they went out they missed it yes I've read some people they said no the vision are in the denomination so if you are telling me that the VIS are in then you are telling that the denomination they don't believe in Trinity but if they believe in Trinity they are not Vance they believe in one more in one more than one God the is in the message if you are not born again because virin is Purity the message has made you to be a good person the message has made you to deny the world but that's not enough my brother and sister what is enough is to be filled with the Holy Ghost so that you can survive the night me I don't agree yes it's their own understanding no in the message we are all the wise the message wise but those they believe in Trinity even there are some that are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ there some but don't believe the true word of God they deny the word of God they have the perverted gospel because the gospel which was preached it must be contined to PR until he comes that's why the Bible tells me until this Gospel of the kingdom of God to everyone the end shall come and Paul said even as or an angel comes from heaven and preaches any other than the one which when we are saying the end time message we are saying the gospel of the Kingdom this is why the devil has complicated us complicate the message of the end time message the end time message is simple the gospel of the kingdom yes and it was first preached by John the Baptist what is the gospel of the kingdom is repent for the kingdom of God is a t Jesus came he preached repent for the kingom of then he disciples 12 then he commissioned them go therefore make Omission to be my disciples baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost according to Matthew then Mark comes in go and preach the gospel go and preach the gospel to Every Creature whoever believes and baptized shall be Hallelujah Hallelujah then Paul came if anyone preached any other gospel so the prophet is not the one who came with the m with the end time message he was not the first person in this God gave him a mission to restore the GOP to restore it did not come with any other doctor that's why sometimes I I get confused this this has been my prayer God help us to come out this confusion of making doctrines and making doct to become so complicated what do believe I tell people that I believe in the apostolical that's the do I have because that's the do the prophet preached the do the Apostle the prophet restored back to the Pentecost that's why he was even boasting himself PR exactly like Paul Paul God called him the foundation the of God there's no other Foundation man can Le apart from that which has been already and that is Jesus Christ to be the chief [Applause] corner there's no another do but see what is happening in the message there are so many [Music] doctrines there's so many doctr trying to complicate TR to deceive many my brother my sister let's come back to the will of God when we are truly born again we're going to have we are going to be Sons and Daughters of God before you know it you have the nature of God before you know it all the manifestations of the flesh die this is why the apost says I Die daily I Die daily so that Christ can manifest when you are born again you begin to die dead to flesh CH begin to manifest and view in your life even if you are casting out Dem you are not casting demons because you are a religious person you are casting demons because it pleases him yes it's not for the show you are doing it because him want to be glorified in what not for people to see you that Mir no you are giving glory to him who is in you now this is why the denomination this is why the denomination and many people in a religious Circle they don't value baptism but I want to tell you value the baptism and make sure that be sincere expose yourself be naked before God and be baptized then you receive the Holy Spirit sometimes ask yourself from the time you were born again or from the time you were baptized I can ask you a question like the same question Paul asked the Disciples of John did you receive the holy spirit because we don't get baptized just for the sake of getting bapz we get baptized to open the way for the Holy Ghost to fill us so if you have been baptized water and you have no Holy Spirit ask yourself why only two things one and confess the sin or you were just baptized to praise the pastor and the deons you did not believe but if you are truly believe repented and receive the baptism there's nothing that can hinder you to receive the holy go because this is the promise this is the promise this is the will of God God is to fill people with his Spirit and the only way God can fill people with his spirit is to hear the gospel repent and baptizing and receive the Holy Ghost if these things is not happening in your life it means somewhere somehow you are outside the will of God you can even serve God you can even become a pastor you can even L the dead yet you are not the son Hallelujah the denomination there some bapz in the name of Jesus Christ but it's seated gospel because the gospel has only three things one salvation of a soul two conduct three order see these people imitate the true baptism see the way they conduct themselves then you see a pered gospel hallelujah hallelujah this is why me have stopped Pastor me have stopped blessing heavy Lords on sisters and brothers dress well dress well we are making Hypocrites but when somebody deceive the Holy Ghost the holy spirit will teach you how to the holy spirit will teach you how to look the will teach you how to speak the spirit will teach you how to behave this is why we have sent in every Fellowship but in homes we have got demons but when We Gather when you look Saints even misot the prophet at the growth of the church you have to look to the sisters you find sisters are natural but when you go home the way they mistreat their husand the way they mistreat their dependence the way they Mist their neighbors why I don't blame them that is AIC nature that's theic nature and the works of the flesh Brothers they look nice but when you go home they punch their wife like punching in their heart there's no love I tells brothers that if you can raise your hand beat your wife then you were a mad person one day we had we had couples meeting then I told sisters if your husband beats you let me know so that we begin to look for a Psy psychatric doctor because he must be mad then all Brothers looked at me then one how P then I okay I'll answer you you I want you yourself the one who have asked me a question I want you to tell me you find me starting punching myself what are you going to say you say the pastor has Le m is it not so is now too late too late man shall leave mother and father and himself to his wife and the two shall be then you are beating yourself you a m person you are a mad person yes no what if she goes she makes mistakes I I asked him a question in your life when you are doing your own thing when you make a mistake you take a stick and beat yourself or you just feel sorry for the mistake you have made yes so even your wife makes a mistake Hallelujah just feel sorry now because people are not born again they're always in flesh in the flesh has no perfect love because perfect love covers the M if God did not love you no one was going to be saved because there a perfect love covered all your and bring you back so that you can be his son so that he can give the spirit in you so that you can be led by the spirit this is the only difference between the law and the grace Hallelujah the grace is for you to receive the Holy Ghost God in you to you but the law is a forcing [Music] matter fearing people if they see me do this that's why law has not saved anyone God bless you [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah amen this was worth our time Amen Let us give another clap of praise to the Lord amen Pastor Paul this is exactly what I believe this is what we believe here I have been so immensely blessed and refreshed the first experience I had with in Zambia was not good because I was cheated by somebody I told you that story some when I was entering Zambia and then the other person I met a minister I had an encounter with from Zambia I did not love the way they presented the words but today I've had a fresh connection with [Music] Zambia the our precious brother has preached the message and I'm one person who does not believe the message of works and actually he he presented it so well and really this sermon today is the reason why I Don't Preach works I preach Grace and he has told us Grace is receiving the holy spirit because when you receive the Holy Spirit The Works will come automatically but if you don't have the Holy Spirit and we will force you and teach you and show you what to do tell how to then you will live well before us but the moment you are in your private space you will live completely contrary to what we we Tau you and that's why we should preach the message of Grace amen not of works and you know I've been thinking about the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler was a good man his Works were good works but you see he was not filled with the Holy Spirit he was not in the will of God and when he came to Jesus and Jesus showed him the way of the will of God he couldn't do it why because he could not forsake he could not expose himself and forsake everything else and that's what we need to do and that is what our generation has failed to do and the Bible says this this man went away sad in his because he had many possessions many Believers have a lot of possessions things they not willing to live UNC confessed sins they willing to cover up and the moment you are like that you cannot be filled with the Holy Spirit and if you're not filled with the Holy Spirit you will miss the Rapture and if you miss the Rapture you are not part of the bride and a brother mentioned that example of of the sister with the gift of tongues you know he said all these gifts can be counter fated and I know some may have a question on that how possible all gifts of the Spirit can be fed but one thing cannot cannot be fixed is the nature of Christ that comes out of receiving the spirit of Jesus Christ appetite of dressing bad living immoral lustful Spirits you don't need to fight with them it's not about struggling it's about yielding yourself and letting God fill you with the spirit when you are filled with the spirit then you receive a new nature the nature that is an an overcoming nature and the prophet of God would speak about men or people who are gifted maybe to compliment on what our brother said with that sister that um was speaking in tongues and yet leaving the wrong kind of life and not being a believer of not being filled with the spirit of God it is possible and a prophet in the message and this is a message I recommend to each of you to go and listen they anointed ones at the end time it's a very important message for believers to listen to brother bam preached it in the year 1965 it's just a little paragraph I read to you the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them desire to save Souls that it gives them power to perform miracle that same Holy Spirit it folds on the unjust the same as it falls on the Jud the same Holy Spirit it says the very same Spirit now you can't make it another way and you understand 244 he said there shall arise false [Music] Christ false anointed ones now he says false anointed ones false anointed ones so and the prophet continues to say anointed listen this is very wonderful Anointed with a genuine thing but be false prophets to it false teachers of it they are anointed with the right genuine Holy Spirit but they are false teachers of that Spirit they are false teachers they false preachers but they are anointed with the right Spirit that's why someone can speak tongues prophesy even preach even raise the Dead talk about any Miracle you know signs and wonders people can perform them and still not make it in the Rapture what will help them to make it what will help all of us to make it is by being in the will of God perfect will of God is for us to be filled with the Holy Spirit he says don't survive on the oil upon the message the message is Anointed by the way that's why you know a woman preacher will preach it and the moment she begin preaching it she will be excited she she will be anointed and she will prophesy and she will speak that that word and that word will will do things in the lives of people she's not supposed to even preach but why is she anointed because the word is Anointed anyone who will preach the word amen will receive the anointing of but we have been told tonight that you can sit there in the message believe the message and be in church around the word and you even think and presume you filled with the spirit because you feel like a Believer but you see you are just around the oil or the anointing of the [Applause] word he says you you should receive your own oil in your own vessel you are that vessel and God wants to fill that vessel with his oil praise the name of the Lord those were wonderful nuggets that have been blessed the gospel of the kingdom is the end time message the end time message is not another teaching it is not another denomination it is not an idea that started with William br this is the apostolic message that the apostles preach that the apostles believed brother Bram only restored it back to chch this is what we believe this is the original message this is the first message and we are the original Pentecost we are not believing some kind of new doctrine we are not a cult never preached anything that is not in the Bible everything the message is you will find it here he said if I preach anything that is not in the Bible leave it alone but the reason why we believe the message is because it is a bible message it is not a new doctrine we are not a new denomination by the way that is why we are not a denomination because we are Christians we are followers of Jesus Christ we are walking in the perfect will of God friends I've have been so recharged tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I can go on and on reciting the things have been
