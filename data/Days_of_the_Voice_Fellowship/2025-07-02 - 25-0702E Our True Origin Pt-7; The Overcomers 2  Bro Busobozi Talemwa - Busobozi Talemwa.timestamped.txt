[33:27] Amen. Now we are going to read on on uh
[33:31] we are going to read what we read on
[33:33] Sunday and uh but we are going to
[33:36] emphasize verses 19 22 that is chapter 3
[33:40] of the book of revelation
[33:44] but I'm going to read from verses one so
[33:46] that those of you who perhaps missed
[33:48] something can be able to get it in the
[33:50] service tonight. And unto the angel of
[33:53] the church in Sardis, write
[33:57] these things, saith he that has the
[33:59] seven spirits of God, and the seven
[34:01] stars. I know thy works, that thou hast
[34:04] a name,
[34:06] that thou livest and are dead. Be
[34:11] watchful and strengthen the things which
[34:13] remain.
[34:16] Am I reading the correct
[34:19] portion? I think I'm reading uh I'm
[34:22] reading from verses one. This is Sadis.
[34:24] I wanted to to read the one that the
[34:26] portion that speaks about u uh Ladi. I
[34:29] think we begin from verses 14. Excuse
[34:31] me.
[34:33] Yeah. Just just flip your page and go to
[34:36] verses 14. And unto the angel of the
[34:38] church of the Ladysians, write these
[34:40] things saith the Amen, the faithful and
[34:43] true witness,
[34:46] the beginning of the creation of God. I
[34:49] know thy works that thou art neither
[34:51] cold nor hot, I would thou what? Cold or
[34:54] hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm,
[34:57] and neither cold nor hot, I would spew
[35:00] thee out of my mouth. Because thou
[35:02] sayest, I am rich and increase with
[35:04] goods, and have need of nothing. And
[35:07] knowest not that thou art wretched, and
[35:10] miserable, and poor, and blind, and
[35:13] naked. I counseel thee to buy of me gold
[35:17] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[35:20] rich and white raignment that thou
[35:22] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[35:26] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[35:29] thine eyes with eyes of that thou mayest
[35:32] see as I may as many as I love I rebuke
[35:36] and chesten be zealous therefore and
[35:38] repent. Behold I stand at the door and
[35:41] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[35:44] the door, I will come into him and will
[35:48] s with him and he with me. Amen. We
[35:50] should be able to say amen to that. To
[35:52] him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[35:54] seat with me in my throne. Even as I
[35:57] also overcame, even as I also overcame
[36:01] and sat and I'm sat down with my father
[36:04] in his throne. He that has an ear, let
[36:08] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[36:10] churches. Amen. and you may be seated.
[36:12] May the Lord add bless you to the
[36:13] reading of the word tonight.
[36:16] Now before we go into the word, I just
[36:17] wanted to let you know brother we um
[36:21] brother Martin went to represent us uh
[36:25] in Mitana. I was meant to go but I
[36:28] because I we had already scheduled that
[36:29] I would be the one speaking today. I
[36:31] could not we could not make a last
[36:33] minute rush hour decision. Uh but there
[36:36] is a a sister probably many of you don't
[36:38] know her. Her name is Bera sister. She
[36:41] she got married to some brother in
[36:43] Mukono but uh you know she was staying
[36:46] with with uh we was we were in the same
[36:48] church at that time in Mitana and I
[36:51] think she she was like a sister to uh uh
[36:54] sister Winnie the wife to brother
[36:56] Martin. Uh so she lost her father a
[37:00] father who had recently I'm told but
[37:01] pastor Leo informed me that he had
[37:03] shortly uh believed just a while um a
[37:07] few maybe a few months I'm not too sure
[37:09] for how long but he had just believed
[37:11] the message and now he has passed passed
[37:13] on. So um we
[37:17] there's several of us who came from Mana
[37:19] really we know that family very well and
[37:21] uh so someone had to really go and
[37:23] represent us. So brother Martin traveled
[37:25] there uh to go for the barrier and also
[37:29] brother Luanga informed me that he's is
[37:31] not well in the body remember him in
[37:32] prayers we have already prayed for him
[37:34] here and also his family uh I think two
[37:37] of his children are also sick uh we just
[37:40] remember them in prayer so this evening
[37:43] we just want to go uh um it's like a
[37:45] continuation I know many who are not
[37:46] here and are following I I really
[37:49] believe that I want to believe that if
[37:51] you are missing church and you are not
[37:54] in church on a weekday fellowship, you
[37:58] always either stream. If you are in a
[38:01] place, maybe you are working and you
[38:02] cannot stream the service, then you
[38:04] should listen to eat afterwards. Um
[38:07] because really we are not just
[38:09] entertaining ourselves but we are
[38:12] feeding on something which is preparing
[38:13] us for something. So you do not want to
[38:15] be left behind. If you are left behind
[38:18] on the word, I'm sure you'll be left
[38:19] behind when the when the change of the
[38:21] body comes. So you don't want to be left
[38:23] behind. You always want to be with those
[38:25] that are prepared to go. Brother Samuel,
[38:27] I'm happy to see you tonight. So um uh
[38:32] this this evening I just want to uh go
[38:34] to the maybe uh for those on the media
[38:38] department just wanted to mention it.
[38:40] This is just a part two of the sermon on
[38:42] on Sunday. So maybe the overcomers part
[38:44] two. I'm still on the series of the
[38:46] original our true origin. And there's
[38:48] quite a lot of things to talk about.
[38:50] Some brothers and sisters, especially
[38:52] brothers who have some time with me uh
[38:54] in the office, we always get a little
[38:56] deeper and we discuss a few things in
[38:58] the word. I'm telling you, the word is
[39:01] sweet. Whe if you make it a custom to
[39:05] feed on the word, to just feed on the
[39:07] word, to listen to the message or read
[39:09] it. Some are good at reading, others are
[39:12] poor at reading, but they are good at
[39:13] listening. And uh on Sunday I know I
[39:16] mentioned about you know the table
[39:18] software but we also have other
[39:19] softwares like uh the the message hub
[39:21] where you have this message translated
[39:23] into other languages. I think it covers
[39:25] most of our languages here including
[39:27] Luganda, Atesseso, um you know Caramo
[39:32] Jong if you you know you have to you
[39:33] want to carong we also have it there and
[39:36] we have a lot of languages really on the
[39:38] message hub that you some only the text
[39:42] but some also have like Uganda has the
[39:44] audio translation and you can be able to
[39:46] listen to those things cuz this this
[39:48] message was not stored for some do you
[39:51] know that message uh rather Pentecostal
[39:54] people also listen to this message. How
[39:56] many knew that? Yeah, many listen to
[40:00] this message. And the only the only
[40:03] difference between us and them is that
[40:05] when they after they listen to the
[40:06] message, they do not tell their
[40:07] congregation the source of what they are
[40:09] saying. So they they when they speak
[40:11] what they are saying their congregation
[40:14] will be like ah our apostle our pastor
[40:17] or whoever has a big revelation but
[40:19] really when you if you listen to them
[40:22] and you you you you a message reader you
[40:25] can know where the source is. Yeah. And
[40:28] so the the difference with between those
[40:29] preachers and and the message preachers
[40:31] is uh we uh tell you the source. We read
[40:35] for you from the source. Not only that,
[40:37] we encourage you to go to the source and
[40:39] dip your weak.
[40:42] You dip your weak into the source and
[40:44] also feed by yourselves directly. And so
[40:47] I tell you, a believer who reads the
[40:49] message can never be the same with the
[40:51] one who doesn't read the message. It can
[40:53] it can never be you have if you read the
[40:56] message or you feed on the on the word
[40:57] of God you study the Bible you study the
[40:59] message every day of your life you will
[41:03] realize that there is a certain level of
[41:04] growth and maturity that you will be
[41:07] able to get to so I'm going to encourage
[41:09] you to do this and I will know I know
[41:12] I'm already getting a few testimonies of
[41:14] brothers sisters who get into some
[41:16] messages and they call me when they're
[41:18] very excited oh pastor I was reading
[41:19] this one can you imagine and then maybe
[41:21] they have a question out of I I I love
[41:23] such kind of conversations, you know,
[41:26] whereby brother Marvin will meet uh uh
[41:28] brother David and uh you know they are
[41:31] not talking about anything but they're
[41:32] talking about the word. You know how
[41:34] sweet it is you know you meet one
[41:36] another in your homes instead of you
[41:38] know going into gossip so and so did
[41:40] this and so and so did not do that. You
[41:42] you begin going into the word either so
[41:45] and so meet sister so and so and then
[41:47] you begin you know talking about what
[41:48] have you been reading. You know these
[41:50] days whenever I meet I meet some
[41:51] brothers I ask them what what have you
[41:53] been feeding on recently and then they
[41:55] begin to tell me oh then I also bring
[41:57] something and then we begin enjoying and
[41:59] then I also tell them what I've been
[42:00] feeding on. I I think we need to make it
[42:02] like a custom. Yeah. We need to make it
[42:05] like a custom. And I'm telling you the
[42:07] bride is getting ready to go. I believe
[42:10] you are one of those getting ready to
[42:11] go. Praise the name of the Lord. I know
[42:14] the devil has wanted to make it like uh
[42:16] uh you know to try and and and bring
[42:18] down the value of the message and uh try
[42:21] to make some believers actually hate
[42:24] listening to the message. How the devil
[42:26] is very cunning I tell you very very
[42:28] cunning. You know how he's doing it? The
[42:31] way he's doing it is he's going is um he
[42:34] anointed some people to try and and say
[42:37] we no longer need preachers on the
[42:39] pullpit to preach. All we need is uh to
[42:41] play the tape. So come to church and let
[42:44] and only hear the tape being played. Uh
[42:46] that's all we need to do. If anybody's
[42:48] preaching they are wrong. Now when you
[42:50] when people who are not very well
[42:52] established in the truth get to hear
[42:54] that they get offended not at the person
[42:57] saying that but at the message itself
[42:59] and then they they they eventually begin
[43:01] to draw away their attention from the
[43:04] word and they think all they need is the
[43:07] five-fold ministry. But I want you to
[43:09] know the five-fold ministry has no new
[43:12] message. The five-fold ministry, the
[43:14] preachers, the pastors, the evangelists,
[43:16] the prophets, the the the uh you know
[43:18] the the pastors, you know, all all these
[43:21] preachers are only saying what the
[43:24] messenger of our day is saying. So we
[43:29] are not preaching another message or a
[43:30] new message. It's the same message you
[43:32] see. But we are quoting and that's why
[43:35] we quote for you. That's why we, you
[43:36] know, even the revelation we have. Yes,
[43:38] I know that it's progressive revelation.
[43:40] God continues to power new revelation.
[43:42] Even on the same thing, new revelation
[43:44] keeps coming. But I tell you, it's not
[43:46] going to be a higher revelation. It's
[43:48] going to be a deeper revelation, but not
[43:50] a higher revelation because we have
[43:52] received a the highest revelation in our
[43:55] age. There is no more uh uh revelations
[43:59] on the same things that God has revealed
[44:01] in our day. We know for example if it is
[44:03] revelation on baptism in the name of our
[44:05] lord Jesus Christ we cannot get a higher
[44:07] revelation than that it's the highest
[44:09] revelation but you see we can the way
[44:12] you get into the scriptures if you feed
[44:13] on the word you know the way you get
[44:15] into them and the way you explaining it
[44:17] actually you begin to see it better if
[44:19] you study the word and if you hear a
[44:21] preacher preaching it you know it used
[44:23] to be that many many I realized that
[44:25] many when the message had just come many
[44:27] people were actually preaching the
[44:29] oneness
[44:31] uh uh a a a perspective on the Godhead
[44:35] and on baptism. You see, if they get to
[44:38] think that, oh, you know, Jesus is the
[44:40] father, Jesus is the son, Jesus is the
[44:42] holy spirit. We know that's not true.
[44:45] But many looked at it that way, right?
[44:48] Because we know that Jesus is the son.
[44:50] How many believe that? But we also know
[44:53] he is the son of God means flesh of God.
[44:56] You see, he had the fullness of godhead
[44:58] bodily. It dwelt in him. So we know that
[45:00] Jesus Christ is God in flesh. John
[45:02] chapter 1 vers 1. And so there are many
[45:05] many things that I would love to talk to
[45:07] you about but let's just get into the
[45:08] word for tonight so that we save on
[45:10] time. Now um we are speaking on the
[45:13] overcomers if you if you realize and
[45:16] it's going to be a little a little Bible
[45:19] study and I want to take you a little
[45:21] slow with with um with it so that you
[45:23] don't get to miss. If you have your your
[45:25] your Bible and a pen you can underline
[45:28] some of these things. I'm going to
[45:30] outline uh or highlight for you. If you
[45:33] look at the book of Revelation chapter 1
[45:38] um vers
[45:41] chapter one okay chapter one mainly
[45:43] chapter 1 chapter 2 and chapter 3. Okay.
[45:48] These first uh chapters of the book of
[45:51] revelation are really introducing or
[45:54] talking about the seven church ages. It
[45:58] is speaking about the seven church ages.
[46:00] Uh we know that Jesus Christ has one
[46:04] church. How many churches does he have?
[46:06] One church. And that's the church uh is
[46:09] not a building. It's not a denomination.
[46:13] That church is not even a group of
[46:15] people in one place. It is the mystical
[46:20] body of Jesus Christ.
[46:25] is the body of Christ all over the
[46:27] world. You see, but you know those who
[46:30] are in Christ, that's the church of
[46:33] Jesus Christ. It's all over the world.
[46:35] But we see it is symbolized in the book
[46:37] of Revelation especially in chapter if
[46:41] you look at chapter
[46:44] chapter one I believe it is. Let's look
[46:46] at the verses
[46:47] um vers 12. May the Lord help us to see
[46:50] some of these things that I want to talk
[46:52] about today. Verses 12, it says, "And I
[46:55] turned to see the voice that spake with
[46:57] me and being turned, I saw seven golden
[47:01] candlesticks." Now this, before I
[47:03] continue, these candlesticks here
[47:05] represent the church. You know, it is
[47:08] seven candlesticks, but remember the
[47:09] church is one. So I can say here it
[47:12] represents seven churches. Now these are
[47:14] not seven churches. It is the same
[47:16] church but in seven ages. That's why we
[47:20] call it seven church ages. Right from
[47:23] the very first one, when was the first
[47:25] church? H it was when the disciples of
[47:28] Jesus Christ were here on earth after
[47:31] the ascension of Jesus Christ into
[47:32] heaven. Now that started the church
[47:36] dispensation when the Holy Ghost fell.
[47:39] That started the very first church age.
[47:41] It started the first church
[47:43] dispensation. We we know of course the
[47:45] church at Ephesus started in Acts
[47:47] chapter 19 when uh uh Paul had now the
[47:52] gospel had now gone among the Gentiles
[47:55] and Paul baptized the very first uh uh
[47:58] Gentiles and um we see that at Ephesas
[48:02] that's where they were baptized and the
[48:04] gentile church really starts there but
[48:07] you see okay we'll come back to that and
[48:10] then verses 13 it says and in the midst
[48:12] of the seven candlesticks One like unto
[48:14] the son of man clothed with a garment
[48:17] down to the foot and gut about the ps
[48:19] with a gold and god. All these things
[48:21] have a s a symbolic and we can explain
[48:24] them. His head and his hairs were like
[48:27] wool as white as snow and his eyes were
[48:30] as as a flame of fire and his feet like
[48:34] uh like unto fine brass. And as they
[48:36] burned in a furnace, and sorry, as if
[48:39] they burned in a furnace, and his voice
[48:40] as the sound of many waters, and in his
[48:43] right hand were seven stars, and out of
[48:47] his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword,
[48:50] and his countenance was in the sun was
[48:52] as the sun shineth in the in his
[48:55] strength. And when I saw him, I fell at
[48:58] his feet as dead. And he laid his right
[49:01] hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not.
[49:04] I am the first and I am the last.
[49:07] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[49:10] behold I am alive forever more. Amen.
[49:13] And have the keys of hell and death. We
[49:15] have talked about that so many times in
[49:16] this series. Write the things which thou
[49:18] so uh which thou has seen and the things
[49:22] which are and the things which shall be
[49:25] here in hereafter. That's how we are
[49:28] able to know that whatever he's going to
[49:30] talk about now, it was not happening at
[49:33] that time only. It was happening and it
[49:36] was going to happen after that time. So
[49:38] this was a a prophetic vision that that
[49:41] that that John saw. It was talking of
[49:45] the future including it was talking
[49:47] about our generation, our age, our time.
[49:50] Praise the name of the Lord. So the
[49:52] mystery of the seven stars. Okay, are
[49:54] you following me now? So in other words,
[49:56] what what John was seeing in this vision
[49:59] was uh uh was things of the future. It
[50:02] was talking of things which was going to
[50:03] come in the future. And what are they?
[50:06] These the things he's talking about here
[50:08] are the stars.
[50:10] The things he's talking about here are
[50:12] the candlesticks. These were things of
[50:14] the future. The stars are meaning Okay.
[50:17] All right. We'll get to it first. the
[50:19] mystery of the seven stars which thou
[50:21] sawest in my in my right hand and the
[50:23] seven golden candlesticks. The seven
[50:25] stars are the angels of the seven
[50:27] churches and the seven candlesticks
[50:29] which thou sawest are the seven
[50:31] churches. Praise the name of the Lord.
[50:33] So now you can see here that um and I'm
[50:37] not talking about really the church ages
[50:38] today, but I just wanted to give you a
[50:39] little background for you to understand,
[50:41] you know, what we're talking about. So
[50:43] now we see here that uh John is in a
[50:47] vision. remember his is thrown at the
[50:50] island or the aisle of Patmos and here
[50:53] he was all by himself. Of course they
[50:55] they threw him there to die. This was a
[50:58] very dangerous island where they only
[51:00] throw people who they don't know what to
[51:03] do with them. Remember they had already
[51:04] boiled him in oil and he could not burn
[51:07] and now they threw him to this island to
[51:10] die. But you know uh they did not know
[51:13] that this man was in another dimension.
[51:15] That's why I was telling you that a
[51:16] believer, a true believer of the word is
[51:19] actually you you get to a place whereby
[51:21] you get into another dimension. And when
[51:24] you are in that dimension, the devil can
[51:26] do nothing against you. You are
[51:29] protected. You are sealed. Hallelujah.
[51:31] You are sealed away from every hand and
[51:32] every power of darkness. And here when
[51:35] John was in that place, he was he says,
[51:37] "I was in the Lord's day." H when he was
[51:41] on the island and he dreams and he says,
[51:43] "I was on the Lord's day." What is the
[51:45] Lord this day? It means he was in the
[51:47] spirit.
[51:48] He was in the spirit. Everything he saw
[51:51] that that that you know is contained in
[51:54] this uh book of revelation, he saw it in
[51:57] the spirit on the Lord's day. But this
[52:00] was something which took more than 3
[52:03] years. He saw it over three years. But
[52:06] he says it was the Lord's day. So you
[52:09] see what is the Lord's day? The Lord's
[52:10] day is not just the seventh day which is
[52:12] Sabbath.
[52:14] The true Sabbath of a believer is the
[52:16] Holy Spirit. When you are in the spirit,
[52:19] when you receive the Holy Ghost, then
[52:21] you are you have arrived in the Lord's
[52:23] day and you have received your rest. So
[52:25] here John was now in the Lord's day and
[52:28] and and you know he begins to see all
[52:30] these things and part of what he saw he
[52:32] saw uh seven candlesticks. I wish I I um
[52:35] I did not prepare the pictures. I did
[52:36] not know that I would talk about this
[52:38] but um you know he saw seven
[52:40] candlesticks. Sometimes it is good
[52:41] people for you to see things visual
[52:43] makes more sense. So he saw a seven
[52:45] golden candlestick and then he saw one
[52:48] in the middle of the candlestick and in
[52:50] his right hand were seven stars. And
[52:53] then the interpretation is the seven
[52:55] candlesticks are the churches.
[52:58] The seven stars are the angels. Now we
[53:02] know an angel means a messenger. It
[53:04] could be an earthly messenger or a
[53:07] heavenly messenger with wings. But
[53:10] because these are earthly churches on
[53:12] earth, these must be earthly angels, not
[53:16] with wings, but prophets, men on earth
[53:19] that God would use. So here are seven
[53:22] ages, right from the very first one
[53:24] called Ephesus up to the last one called
[53:26] Ladyia. And in every age, God will send
[53:28] a messenger with a message. Now, which
[53:32] age are we living in? Now we are living
[53:34] in the very last age. And this age is
[53:38] called ladisa.
[53:40] Every age has it had its problems. But
[53:43] you know one thing that I wanted you to
[53:44] look at when he reaches the age of he
[53:47] says I stand at the door and knock. If
[53:50] any man hear my voice and open the door
[53:53] I will come into him and will s with him
[53:55] and he with me. Meaning with Ladyia God
[53:59] was kicked out of the church. You know
[54:01] and this is the condition of our
[54:03] generation really. People don't have
[54:05] time for God. No time for God in homes.
[54:07] No time for God in families. No time for
[54:10] God in churches. But we have time for
[54:12] entertainment. We have time for, you
[54:14] know, games. We have time for, you know,
[54:16] movies. We have time for, you know,
[54:18] that's why I was telling you, brother,
[54:19] study the word. Eat the book. Eat the
[54:21] book. Eat the book. Tell your neighbor,
[54:23] eat the book.
[54:25] But we don't have time for God. He's
[54:27] kicked out. It is so boring. You know
[54:30] you talk about the word maybe it is
[54:31] exciting when the person is talking
[54:33] about it but when you are reading it by
[54:35] yourself it is so boring. Why the hearts
[54:38] of people no longer have that hunger.
[54:41] They no longer have that thirst for the
[54:43] word. Let us be sincere level.
[54:47] Let us put it down on your level. Do you
[54:50] listen to the message? Do you read the
[54:51] Bible? Do you do you eat the book? If
[54:55] you don't, it means you don't have the
[54:57] hunger. You don't have the thirst.
[55:00] How many had lunch today?
[55:04] The only reason why you had lunch is
[55:06] because you had hunger for it. If you
[55:08] didn't have lunch, I want to believe it
[55:10] is because you didn't hunger. You do not
[55:12] have hunger. Maybe you had a heavy
[55:14] breakfast. You see, the only reason why
[55:17] we eat is because we have hunger. But if
[55:19] you don't have hunger, you can't eat.
[55:22] But there are two reasons why you will
[55:24] not have hunger. is because you are full
[55:27] or
[55:30] or
[55:31] you are sick.
[55:34] That's the only reason. Either you are
[55:36] sick. The moment someone becomes sick,
[55:38] they lose appetite.
[55:40] And the moment they the sickness has has
[55:43] lifted, oh, then they would say, "Oh, I
[55:45] want to eat. Is there some food in the
[55:47] pot?"
[55:49] We have many Christians who are sick.
[55:52] There is no appetite for the word. There
[55:55] is no appetite. There is no thirst for
[55:57] for the things of God. There is no
[55:59] thirst to pray. There is no hunger to
[56:01] read to feed on the word. Why? Because
[56:03] you know they're dry. The world has
[56:06] dried them up. And you know until God
[56:08] says, "I am on the outside of your
[56:11] hearts and I'm knocking."
[56:13] Our generation Jesus Christ is on the
[56:15] outside of the church. He's not on the
[56:17] inside. And he's on the outside and he's
[56:19] knocking and he's saying, "Who will open
[56:22] for me?" But he says, "If you open for
[56:24] me, I will come in." Amen. And I will
[56:27] enter in and I will s together with you.
[56:29] Hallelujah.
[56:31] Oh, may God help us that we may open for
[56:34] him. We may allow him to come in.
[56:36] Hallelujah. And he says, "When I come
[56:38] in, I'm going to eat with you." Amen.
[56:42] Let me tell you, when you begin, Amen.
[56:44] When Christ is on the throne of your
[56:45] heart and you begin feeding on the word,
[56:47] there is some joy that comes in your
[56:49] heart. Amen. You do it with revelation.
[56:51] There is some happiness that you have.
[56:53] Amen. You get excited about the word.
[56:56] Whenever you read it, you get excited.
[56:58] Amen. Whenever you talk about it, you
[57:00] get excited. Why? Because there is
[57:02] stimulation of revelation that comes
[57:03] with it. Praise the name of the Lord.
[57:07] You see, he says, "I am at the door and
[57:08] I'm knocking. If any man hear my voice
[57:10] and open the door, I will come in to him
[57:14] and I will s with him and he with me.
[57:17] And then he says to him that
[57:19] overcomemeth.
[57:21] Now if you notice,
[57:24] excuse me, in every age,
[57:30] right from the first one,
[57:40] excuse me,
[57:47] right from the first one in Ephes
[57:50] Chapter 2, he says, uh, look at those,
[57:55] um,
[57:59] okay, read verses seven and see what he
[58:02] says. He that has an ear,
[58:07] let him hear what the spirit says unto
[58:09] the churches. Okay, have you seen that?
[58:11] To him that overcomemeth will I give to
[58:15] eat of the tree of life
[58:20] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[58:22] God. I wish I had time to talk about
[58:24] each of them but I just want to show you
[58:26] there's something I'm trying to show you
[58:27] here. And then you go to Sana
[58:29] is vers uh 11. It says he that has an
[58:35] ear let him hear what the spirit say
[58:38] unto the churches. He that overcomemeth
[58:41] shall not be heart of the second death.
[58:44] Amen. You know what the second death is
[58:46] if you you you've read the book of
[58:47] revelation before. All right. Now that's
[58:50] the destruction of the souls. So now
[58:52] when you go to Pamos vers um uh I want
[58:57] to believe vers 11. He says, "To him
[59:00] that overcomemeth will I give to eat of
[59:02] the hidden manner, and he will give him
[59:04] a white stone, and in the stone a new
[59:06] name written, which no man knoweth,
[59:09] saving he that receiveth it."
[59:12] Thotira. Okay. When you go to Thotira
[59:16] and then you you you you read verses 29,
[59:19] he says um um uh all right, verses 26.
[59:24] But he that overcomemeth and keepeth my
[59:26] works unto the end, to him will I give
[59:30] power over the nations, and he shall
[59:33] rule them with a rod of iron, and as the
[59:35] vessels of a potter shall they broke,
[59:37] shall they be broken to shivers, even as
[59:40] I received of my father. I will give him
[59:43] the morning star. Now when you go to
[59:45] Sardis, he says, "He that overcometh,"
[59:47] that's chapter 3:5, "the shall be closed
[59:50] in white rimmen, and I will not blot out
[59:53] his name out of the book of life, but I
[59:55] will confess his name before my father
[59:58] and before his angels." You go to
[1:00:00] Philadelphia on verses um on vers 12. He
[1:00:07] um that him that overcometh will I make
[1:00:09] a pillar in the temple of my God. And he
[1:00:12] shall go on it shall go no more out. And
[1:00:16] I will write upon him the name of my God
[1:00:18] and the name of of the city of my God
[1:00:20] which is the new Jerusalem which cometh
[1:00:23] down and out of heaven from my God. and
[1:00:26] I will write upon him my new name. Amen.
[1:00:30] These are all promises. Now when you
[1:00:32] come to the last age, which is our age,
[1:00:36] our time, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:00:40] What does he say to him that overcometh
[1:00:43] will I grant to seat with me in my
[1:00:45] throne? Just before he said that, he
[1:00:48] said, I am outside of the door and I'm
[1:00:51] knocking. Any man that opens for me, I
[1:00:53] will come in. Meaning meaning to be able
[1:00:56] to have oh my God to have the ability to
[1:00:59] open for him is overcoming.
[1:01:03] Amen. Not everybody can open for him.
[1:01:05] Many think they have open for Christ.
[1:01:08] You ask them do you be say well I'm a
[1:01:10] believer. I'm a Christian. But no they
[1:01:11] are not. How do you know? You will know
[1:01:13] them by their fruits. You know them by
[1:01:16] their life. Not by their testimony but
[1:01:18] by their life. The word of their
[1:01:20] testimony is the blood of the lamb. Let
[1:01:22] me tell you the Bible says and they
[1:01:23] overcame by the word of their testimony.
[1:01:27] But the word of their testimony, the
[1:01:28] word of our testimony is the blood of
[1:01:30] the lamb. And what shows that we we have
[1:01:33] received the blood, the blood, the
[1:01:34] token, Amen. has been applied upon our
[1:01:37] lives. What shows? The only thing that
[1:01:39] shows, Amen, is the change of our life.
[1:01:42] Amen. Us no longer be being able to live
[1:01:44] like the world.
[1:01:46] You see, he says to him that
[1:01:48] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[1:01:50] in my throne. Now the last age which is
[1:01:54] the end of all ages by the way there is
[1:01:57] no more age after this.
[1:02:00] Let me say it again. There is no more
[1:02:02] age after this. So I don't know what you
[1:02:04] are doing my brother my sister if I were
[1:02:07] you. Amen. Which I am not. I myself. But
[1:02:10] I will tell you I am preparing myself
[1:02:12] for the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[1:02:14] Because I know this is the very last
[1:02:16] age. No more time. Amen. Time is no
[1:02:19] longer. No more time. This is the very
[1:02:21] last age. The bride ought to be ready.
[1:02:24] We have to be ready. Let Let me let us
[1:02:26] go back to the foundations of what we
[1:02:28] believe. Amen. It's a getting ready
[1:02:31] time. Are you ready for the coming of
[1:02:33] the Lord? Oh, if the Lord should come
[1:02:36] tonight. Are you ready? Am I ready? Yes.
[1:02:38] We can do all the things we are doing.
[1:02:40] We can build homes. We can plant, you
[1:02:42] know, our bananas. We can um, you know,
[1:02:44] collect money for our church land. But I
[1:02:46] tell you, brother, amen. It doesn't mean
[1:02:48] we don't believe. we are believing is
[1:02:50] coming tomorrow.
[1:02:52] But doesn't mean that we are not going
[1:02:54] to collect money to do this and that.
[1:02:56] We're not going to build. We are not. We
[1:02:57] will do all that. He will find us with a
[1:03:00] zeal to serve him. When he comes, you
[1:03:03] will find us doing everything we have to
[1:03:05] do. He will find us winning a soul.
[1:03:07] Amen. And trying to encourage a brother,
[1:03:09] sister who is lost. He will find us on
[1:03:11] our post of duties. And uh you know to
[1:03:14] him that overcometh I will grant to sit
[1:03:16] with me in my throne. Those who are
[1:03:18] going to overcome in our age are going
[1:03:21] to be those that will take the throne
[1:03:24] with him. So, we're going to be rulers.
[1:03:27] Rulers together with him. Hallelujah.
[1:03:31] Amen. Hallelujah. My my I can't wait for
[1:03:33] that time, my brother. I can't wait for
[1:03:36] that time, my sister.
[1:03:38] Now, how do we overcome is the question
[1:03:41] because we're talking about the
[1:03:42] overcomers. How do we overcome?
[1:03:45] This is a very very very important a
[1:03:48] very by the way it's a very important
[1:03:51] subject
[1:03:54] in our time
[1:03:57] brother can you give us um a a quote
[1:04:00] from church age
[1:04:04] we read this portion okay I think we
[1:04:06] finished with this quote on Sunday and I
[1:04:08] want to begin with it
[1:04:10] um
[1:04:12] so that you see some very very
[1:04:14] interesting ing things here and brother
[1:04:16] Shim I hope I will be able to get to
[1:04:17] those quotes that we talked about the
[1:04:19] other day he says in his own personal
[1:04:22] life now this is talking is is just a
[1:04:26] quote I'm I'm I'm quoting out of that
[1:04:28] and just follow follow closely brother
[1:04:29] if you have the words put it up if you
[1:04:32] don't and I know you'll get it soon but
[1:04:34] um before he does just follow me
[1:04:36] brothers and uh I wish brother Isaac you
[1:04:38] were able also to put up for the people
[1:04:40] who are online it's usually good if they
[1:04:42] can read then they can follow easily in
[1:04:45] his own personal life. Now, speaking of
[1:04:46] the life of Christ, contending with
[1:04:49] himself,
[1:04:50] he overcame by obedience to the word of
[1:04:53] God. Meaning Jesus, you know, Jesus was
[1:04:56] our example. Amen. He came and he was a
[1:05:00] man like you. He was a human being like
[1:05:02] you and I. But when he was on earth, he
[1:05:04] too had to overcome.
[1:05:07] But how did he overcome? He overcame
[1:05:09] before he overcame, the Bible says he
[1:05:10] was contending with himself. You know he
[1:05:13] had his own will. He didn't want to die.
[1:05:16] There is this thing he desired to do but
[1:05:18] there is this thing that he wanted to
[1:05:19] do. You understand? So it's a contion.
[1:05:22] We are fighting every day. Brother, it's
[1:05:25] not an easy journey. But I tell you
[1:05:27] what, there is a group going to
[1:05:29] overcome. In every generation is already
[1:05:32] prophesied. It's already done deal.
[1:05:34] Amen. In every generation there is a
[1:05:37] group of overcomers. There is also a
[1:05:40] group of those who cannot overcome. But
[1:05:43] Amen. I believe I am part of those who
[1:05:45] are going to overcome in my generation.
[1:05:48] Amen. Amen. If we are going to overcome,
[1:05:51] it means there is a battle, there is a
[1:05:53] contending to do. There is a fighting to
[1:05:55] do. Even Apostle Paul said, "Oh, what I
[1:05:58] don't want to do, I find myself doing."
[1:06:00] Meaning there was a contention, a
[1:06:02] battle, a war going on within him,
[1:06:04] brother. But let me tell you, no matter
[1:06:06] what happens, we must overcome. Amen.
[1:06:09] Amen. And Jesus, how did he overcome?
[1:06:12] Now, I want us to see how Jesus
[1:06:15] overcame. He overcame by obedience to
[1:06:19] the word of God. Amen. A believer will
[1:06:23] not overcome only by prayer or by, you
[1:06:25] know, laying on of hands or by this and
[1:06:27] that. Let me tell you, brother, what you
[1:06:29] need to do is to obey the word of God.
[1:06:32] But how can you obey what you don't
[1:06:34] know?
[1:06:37] You see now do you see where we are
[1:06:39] going you can't obey what you don't know
[1:06:42] these people came up and they asked
[1:06:44] Jesus they said master
[1:06:47] of course on the mount of
[1:06:48] transfiguration they said why did the
[1:06:50] scribes say
[1:06:53] that Elias will come first
[1:06:58] they say Elias shall first come now
[1:07:02] remember they have seen Moses they have
[1:07:04] seen Elijah and they have seen Jesus
[1:07:07] being transfigured together with them in
[1:07:09] the cloud. Then they received the
[1:07:11] revelation, this is the Messiah, but it
[1:07:13] was written in Malachi 4 that before the
[1:07:16] Messiah comes, Elijah shall do what?
[1:07:19] Shall come first. Now they have seen,
[1:07:22] they have known, they have received the
[1:07:23] revelation that Jesus is the what? The
[1:07:26] Messiah. So they were confused. Why did
[1:07:29] Malachi say Elijah will come first or
[1:07:32] rather Elijah shall come first? But
[1:07:34] Jesus knew what they were talking about.
[1:07:36] Are you following me?
[1:07:39] He knew what they were talking about. He
[1:07:41] knew scripture.
[1:07:44] Jesus never sat in any class. You don't
[1:07:46] need to sit in a class to know how to
[1:07:48] read a Bible. Brother, if you have the
[1:07:50] spirit of Christ in you, he will drive
[1:07:52] you into the word. We have even seen
[1:07:55] people who have never gone to school,
[1:07:57] but somehow they receive divine ability
[1:08:00] to read the Bible. I tell you what, the
[1:08:02] word of God has a supernatural something
[1:08:04] over it.
[1:08:06] And Jesus quoted the scripture. He told
[1:08:09] him, "Yes, Elias shall truly first come
[1:08:12] and restore all things. Elias truly
[1:08:15] shall first come and restore all things.
[1:08:17] But I say unto you, Elias has come
[1:08:19] already." And they knew him not. And
[1:08:20] they did to him whatsoever they listed.
[1:08:22] Hey, Jesus spoke of Malachi chapter 4
[1:08:26] and divided it into two portions.
[1:08:29] He knew the word and he knew how to
[1:08:31] rightly divide the word of truth. My my
[1:08:34] my. And then one day he's in the temple.
[1:08:38] He's in the temple and they bring the
[1:08:39] Bible. The the priest brings a book and
[1:08:41] puts it before him. He was supposed to
[1:08:44] read it. You remember what happened? He
[1:08:46] took the book and he opened. He knew
[1:08:49] what he was looking for.
[1:09:06] Chronicles. No.
[1:09:08] Until he reached where?
[1:09:11] Isaiah.
[1:09:13] And he went to chapter 61.
[1:09:16] He knew what he was looking for. He knew
[1:09:18] the word, right? And he read,
[1:09:23] "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me.
[1:09:26] He has anointed me. Listen, he read word
[1:09:29] for word and he even knew what time he
[1:09:33] was in.
[1:09:35] Vers two continues and says this, to
[1:09:39] declare the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:09:41] and the day of vengeance of our God and
[1:09:43] to comfort all that mourn. But Jesus
[1:09:46] reached the place where it said to
[1:09:48] declare the acceptable year of the Lord.
[1:09:50] He stopped there.
[1:09:53] He closed the book because he knew the
[1:09:56] first coming, his first coming, that
[1:09:58] time that is the only portion which was
[1:10:01] supposed to be fulfilled. And the other
[1:10:04] portion, yes, was for the Messiah him,
[1:10:06] but not that time. It was for the second
[1:10:09] coming. When he closed the book, what
[1:10:11] did he say? This day is this scripture
[1:10:15] fulfilled in your heart.
[1:10:18] Meaning what you have heard me read only
[1:10:21] is fulfilled. Not what Jeremiah said but
[1:10:24] the only not what Isaiah said but only
[1:10:26] the portion which you have heard me
[1:10:27] read. Hallelujah. So Jesus even knew the
[1:10:32] scripture that spoke of him. And then
[1:10:34] one day he came and he said is there any
[1:10:37] man here who can condemn me of sin? Oh,
[1:10:42] I wish you got it. You'd be shouting
[1:10:43] right now. Is there any man here who can
[1:10:46] condemn me of sin? What was he meaning?
[1:10:48] Is there any man here who can condemn me
[1:10:51] of not believing the word?
[1:10:54] Meaning, I have believed every word. I
[1:10:57] have confessed every word. I have lived
[1:10:59] every word that is written about me in
[1:11:02] my time. I have lived it. I have
[1:11:04] believed it. No man can judge me of
[1:11:06] that. And the disciples of John, they
[1:11:09] came and said, "Hey, he has sent us to
[1:11:11] ask whether you are the one or we should
[1:11:12] wait for another." He said, "I want to
[1:11:14] waste your time." Amen. He went and
[1:11:16] began doing miracles and opened the eyes
[1:11:17] of the blind and said, "Go and tell him
[1:11:20] what you have seen and heard." Meaning,
[1:11:22] I am here to fulfill. Amen. To obey
[1:11:25] every word of my day.
[1:11:29] Hallelujah. They went back and they told
[1:11:32] the people what they had seen, John,
[1:11:34] what they had seen and heard. Of course,
[1:11:36] John would just know yes, he's the one
[1:11:39] and he must have died in peace knowing
[1:11:42] he had done his part. Praise the name of
[1:11:44] the Lord. Amen. Let's give him a clap of
[1:11:46] praise right now.
[1:11:51] Now, I want you to see this part.
[1:11:54] Brother Bam says he overcame. How did he
[1:11:56] overcome? He overcame by obeying the
[1:11:58] obedience to the word of God. So,
[1:12:01] friends, I want to encourage you. Let's
[1:12:04] learn the word. Let's read the word.
[1:12:07] Let's feed on the word. Let us know the
[1:12:09] prophecies about our time. Let us know
[1:12:11] the promises of our time. Let us know.
[1:12:14] Amen. Our rights in the word of God. If
[1:12:17] we don't know, things will happen and
[1:12:19] they you can't interpret it. You can't
[1:12:21] interpret. The Pentecostals will be the
[1:12:23] one who's interpreting for you or some
[1:12:25] of these nominal Christians and their
[1:12:28] interpretations of the word is always
[1:12:29] false.
[1:12:32] So you need to know what you are talking
[1:12:33] about. You need to Amen. And the only
[1:12:35] way you can be able to know is by
[1:12:37] getting God's interpretation.
[1:12:41] Amos 3:7. How does God interpret his
[1:12:43] word? How does interpret his word? By
[1:12:46] the prophets.
[1:12:49] Amen. And so you need to get to know who
[1:12:51] is the prophet in our generation.
[1:12:54] Who is the prophet in our generation?
[1:12:56] And what did he say about this? Amen.
[1:13:00] But how can you know without reading it?
[1:13:03] Get into the message. Feed on the word,
[1:13:05] my brother, my sister.
[1:13:08] Amen. On Sunday, I'm I'm going to take
[1:13:11] it a little higher. We're going to go
[1:13:12] into some things which will make you
[1:13:15] understand why I have to keep on saying
[1:13:17] get into the message, read the message,
[1:13:18] feed on the word. On Sunday, we you get
[1:13:20] ready for that. Now, look at Hebrews. It
[1:13:23] says here in Hebrews 5:7, it says, "Who
[1:13:27] in the days of his flesh, when he had
[1:13:30] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:13:32] with strong crying
[1:13:35] and tears unto him, that was able to
[1:13:37] save him from death, and was heard in
[1:13:40] that he feared. Though he were a son,
[1:13:43] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:13:45] which he suffered." and being made
[1:13:48] perfect,
[1:13:50] he became the author of eternal
[1:13:52] salvation unto all of them that obey
[1:13:55] him. Amen. So in other words, even all
[1:13:57] those who obey him, who is he? He is the
[1:13:59] word of God. So all those that obey the
[1:14:01] word of God, he is the author of their
[1:14:04] eternal salvation. There is no way you
[1:14:06] can perish if you obey him. There's no
[1:14:09] way you can perish if you obey the word.
[1:14:12] What was he obedient to? He was obedient
[1:14:15] to the word of God. The Bible says he he
[1:14:17] he learned did you get that portion? He
[1:14:20] says what did he say? He says he learned
[1:14:22] obedience by the things which he
[1:14:24] suffered. And then the question is what
[1:14:26] was he obedient to? He learned obedience
[1:14:29] to the word by the things he suffered.
[1:14:32] So suffering in this present time has a
[1:14:35] portion to help you come into a place of
[1:14:38] obedience to the word.
[1:14:41] That's why God doesn't just give us
[1:14:43] everything we want or everything we
[1:14:44] need. He leaves us a portion of
[1:14:46] suffering, a portion that we are going
[1:14:48] to go through. And then you know instead
[1:14:50] of asking questions and backsliding, it
[1:14:53] is going to propel us into a place of
[1:14:56] obeying what God said.
[1:15:00] Amen.
[1:15:02] Amen. Now it says now then there will
[1:15:06] not be one person who will sit in the
[1:15:08] throne of the Lord Jesus. Now I read
[1:15:11] this on Sunday and some people like ah
[1:15:13] but let me do it again. There will not
[1:15:15] be one person who will sit in the throne
[1:15:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ unless
[1:15:21] he has been leaving that word.
[1:15:29] Now you can't sit there unless you obey
[1:15:31] the word.
[1:15:34] But how can you obey the word you don't
[1:15:35] know? Which means if you don't believe
[1:15:37] the word, if you don't know the word,
[1:15:39] you can't believe the word and you can't
[1:15:40] obey the word. Which means you won't sit
[1:15:42] on the throne. which means you can't
[1:15:44] overcome. So what am I trying to say?
[1:15:47] Feed on the word my brother. Tell your
[1:15:49] neighbor, feed on the word. Feed on the
[1:15:51] word. Amen. He says it will be granted.
[1:15:56] H No, no, no, no, now this is a portion
[1:15:59] that you people need to really hear
[1:16:00] carefully. your prayers and I believe in
[1:16:02] prayers but he says your prayers your
[1:16:05] fastings h your repentances no matter
[1:16:09] what you present to God
[1:16:13] none of that will gain you the privilege
[1:16:17] of sitting in that throne
[1:16:21] you see the Pentecostals
[1:16:23] they don't know that God has already
[1:16:25] answered the prayers they are praying
[1:16:28] they are praying for a revival they are
[1:16:30] fasting for revival.
[1:16:34] They go on prayer mountains for days and
[1:16:36] days, nights and nights,
[1:16:39] sometime 40 nights, sometimes 30 nights,
[1:16:41] sometimes very long time. And what are
[1:16:43] they praying for? They are praying for a
[1:16:46] a revival which will sweep the world.
[1:16:49] But we have had a prophet in our day.
[1:16:53] Amen. And they rejected him. But you
[1:16:56] know, God has used him to bring the
[1:16:59] revival they're looking for.
[1:17:03] What is this end time revival? This end
[1:17:06] time revival is a revival of the people
[1:17:09] of the open book. Listen, it's a revival
[1:17:12] that will amen make the people get
[1:17:14] restored back again to the foundations
[1:17:16] of the of the apostolic faith.
[1:17:19] It's the revival of the people who will
[1:17:22] receive the full word of God.
[1:17:25] This revival is here. And the bride for
[1:17:28] her to receive a revival, she would have
[1:17:30] to obey every word. She have to obey
[1:17:32] every word. And there is something I'm
[1:17:34] coming to. May God help you to say it.
[1:17:38] And you know, brother Bam said, "America
[1:17:40] is done. It is over."
[1:17:43] He said when they reject whenever God
[1:17:45] brings a wave of a move of God in power
[1:17:50] and the people reject it,
[1:17:54] God leaves them and he moves away. And
[1:17:57] even a nation when a nation rejects the
[1:17:59] revival that God has brought, that
[1:18:02] nation dies, God moves away. That's what
[1:18:04] happened in in in in in in Europe. when
[1:18:08] they rejected the revival, the nation
[1:18:10] died. God moved away. Go and see what's
[1:18:13] happening in Europe now in UK and some
[1:18:15] of these other places. This is where
[1:18:17] Christianity came from. Huh? You read
[1:18:19] about the missionaries. But these
[1:18:21] churches which were big and large is now
[1:18:24] being turned into bars.
[1:18:27] The revival is over. God is no longer
[1:18:29] moving in those places. You go to you
[1:18:32] you you you go to a Russia, same thing.
[1:18:36] You go to America, but the Bam said the
[1:18:38] revival in America is dead. It's over.
[1:18:42] God is done with America. No revival.
[1:18:46] People no longer have the love of the
[1:18:48] word. People no longer thirst for the
[1:18:49] things of God. They don't even have time
[1:18:51] to sit down and hear the word. You can
[1:18:53] only find a few here and there.
[1:18:56] Believers of this message who are still
[1:18:58] on fire for God. Otherwise, what they
[1:19:00] have turned it into it has become.
[1:19:02] That's why you know all these people you
[1:19:04] know you know I don't want to mention
[1:19:05] names but all these people you know they
[1:19:06] kind of now are trying to devise a new
[1:19:09] way of keeping the people coming to
[1:19:11] church.
[1:19:13] So they will find some sensational songs
[1:19:15] which will make people jump and they
[1:19:17] have you know tried to devise some new
[1:19:19] dances to make people you know get
[1:19:20] excited so that they don't have a
[1:19:22] feeling that they in church they have a
[1:19:24] feeling they in a bar so they will come
[1:19:26] to church but it's no longer about Jesus
[1:19:29] Christ. is about themselves and the
[1:19:31] flesh. It's about excitement and
[1:19:33] emotional uh uh you know things. But the
[1:19:36] revival there is dead. And now I want to
[1:19:40] say it's going back to Israel. It's
[1:19:43] going back to Israel. Right here in
[1:19:44] Africa, we still have grace. We still
[1:19:47] have a chance that we are seeing many
[1:19:49] many getting saved here and there. But I
[1:19:51] tell you worldwide, the revival is dead.
[1:19:56] It's only the bride getting revived. And
[1:19:58] the only thing that is reviving us
[1:20:00] brother is the opening of the word is us
[1:20:03] knowing what time we are living in and
[1:20:05] what God is doing in our generation.
[1:20:10] You see what the people call a web of
[1:20:12] God or revival is not what God thinks it
[1:20:14] is. You see they're praying for revival
[1:20:17] but revival is here.
[1:20:19] They are praying for God to move in
[1:20:21] power. But God is already moving in
[1:20:23] power among his body, preparing them for
[1:20:27] the change of body. That is the greatest
[1:20:30] thing that will ever happen to the
[1:20:32] earth. All the other disciples, all the
[1:20:35] other believers have been looking
[1:20:36] forward to the to to a time when they
[1:20:39] will change to be translated into
[1:20:42] another body which can never die again.
[1:20:44] That time has never come. That time has
[1:20:47] never come. But we are living in that
[1:20:49] time. We are living in a time when we
[1:20:52] are going to receive to see the change
[1:20:54] of our bodies. Friends, I believe some
[1:20:56] of us will not be dead when that thing
[1:20:58] happens. Amen. That's the real revival.
[1:21:03] Amen. The thing which will bring about
[1:21:05] that. What is that thing? It is the
[1:21:07] word.
[1:21:12] Amen. And see, he says it will be
[1:21:15] granted.
[1:21:16] You see, you can't sit on that throne.
[1:21:19] He says only by
[1:21:23] uh praying, fasting or repentances. Mm-
[1:21:27] You cannot no matter what you present to
[1:21:30] God, it cannot do. None of that will
[1:21:32] gain the privilege you the privilege of
[1:21:33] sitting in that throne. It will be
[1:21:35] granted only to the word bride. Are you
[1:21:39] getting it friends? Amen.
[1:21:41] See, the other Sunday when I said,
[1:21:44] excuse me, when I say that uh it's not
[1:21:47] time of of healings, miracles, and signs
[1:21:50] and wonders,
[1:21:51] I did not mean to say we don't believe
[1:21:53] in those things. You see, the true
[1:21:56] revival will always be followed by that.
[1:21:58] Wherever God is, there is supernatural
[1:22:01] power and manifestations of the spirit.
[1:22:03] You cannot believe God and deny that. We
[1:22:06] don't believe that days of miracles is
[1:22:08] passed. No, we believe that we are in
[1:22:10] the days of miracles.
[1:22:12] But you see friends, what I want to show
[1:22:14] you is that the real revival of the
[1:22:17] bride is that u uh what what is written
[1:22:20] in the book of Mark chapter uh uh Mark
[1:22:22] chapter 16. It says uh uh that go in the
[1:22:26] world preach the gospel to every he that
[1:22:27] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:22:29] saved. He that believeth what? The word
[1:22:34] shall be
[1:22:36] and his signs shall follow them. Who?
[1:22:39] The believers of the word. Does it mean
[1:22:42] signs will not be among those who don't
[1:22:44] believe the word? They will be because
[1:22:45] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:22:47] unjust. That's why your point of focus
[1:22:50] should not be the signs or the wonders.
[1:22:52] Your point of focus should be whether
[1:22:54] you are believing the word. Whether you
[1:22:55] are the word bride. Be sure of who you
[1:22:58] are. And how can you be sure? Feed on
[1:23:01] the word.
[1:23:03] Are you following me now? As the throne
[1:23:05] of the king is shared with the queen
[1:23:07] because she is united to him. So only
[1:23:10] they who are of that word even as he is
[1:23:14] of that word will share that throne.
[1:23:21] Remember,
[1:23:26] we have shown clearly all through the
[1:23:29] ages that even as Adam and Eve fell
[1:23:32] because they left the word and right now
[1:23:35] I've I've been reading this, but the
[1:23:36] Holy Spirit has been speaking something
[1:23:38] else and and and he has not stopped. So,
[1:23:40] let me say it. See, when I say the bride
[1:23:43] of that word, it doesn't mean miracles
[1:23:45] are not there. I want to emphasize that
[1:23:47] the bride of that word is Queen Esther.
[1:23:51] You remember how she came? You know,
[1:23:52] everybody wanted something extra,
[1:23:55] something extra, some gift from the
[1:23:56] king, some gift from the king. So they
[1:23:58] can look beautiful, they can look
[1:23:59] pleasant, they can look exciting, they
[1:24:01] can look, you know, but when it come on
[1:24:03] the town of Esther, she said, "I want
[1:24:05] nothing else." Everything that I needed.
[1:24:08] Amen. The chamber line gave me, you
[1:24:10] know, the king had assigned a chamber
[1:24:12] line for them. But the chamber line is
[1:24:14] the is is the angel, is the messenger.
[1:24:16] And God has sent the message of our
[1:24:18] generation with a word that we need to
[1:24:20] meet the king. So now here it is. Esther
[1:24:23] said, "Everything I have needed, I I I
[1:24:26] desired, I have received. Now the only
[1:24:29] thing that I now need is to see the
[1:24:31] king.
[1:24:33] That's all I need. I want to see the
[1:24:35] king." And they said, "All right. All
[1:24:37] right." Everybody else had received
[1:24:38] things, but the king never liked them.
[1:24:40] But when it came on the turn of Esther,
[1:24:43] Amen. Because our desire was the word.
[1:24:45] The king is the word. The king is the
[1:24:46] Lord. The king is the Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:48] And now when she walked to him and what
[1:24:51] happened? The king saw her. And when the
[1:24:53] king saw her, the king saw himself
[1:24:56] reflected in Esther.
[1:24:59] A man is who who who he marries. A woman
[1:25:03] reflects the ambition of the man. So now
[1:25:05] when the king saw Esther, he saw he all
[1:25:08] his ambitions reflected in her. He said,
[1:25:10] "Ah, this one is my queen from today."
[1:25:14] Amen.
[1:25:15] Amen. I'll tell you something. When the
[1:25:17] king chose the queen,
[1:25:20] the others, he did not reject them. They
[1:25:22] were somewhere in the kingdom. They were
[1:25:24] they were now uh uh uh what's the word?
[1:25:29] Conubines. They were now consubines,
[1:25:32] right? They had had an an experience
[1:25:33] with the king, but they had never gotten
[1:25:36] into that place where they can be called
[1:25:38] a queen, the wife of the king. So, they
[1:25:40] were pushed to stay aside. They were
[1:25:42] told now you can go and stay in your
[1:25:45] houses of the concubines.
[1:25:48] And in the houses of the country, do you
[1:25:50] know the only thing that entertained
[1:25:51] them?
[1:25:53] Gifts from the king. Gifts from the
[1:25:56] king.
[1:25:57] The only thing they had was gifts. The
[1:26:00] only thing they desired was gifts. The
[1:26:02] only thing they could receive was gifts.
[1:26:04] But they cannot receive the king himself
[1:26:07] or any part of the kingdom.
[1:26:10] Does it mean Esther only had the king?
[1:26:13] Yes. But if you only have the king, you
[1:26:16] have all the gifts of the king.
[1:26:20] Amen. And when she came in one time, she
[1:26:24] came in, you know, in a place where she
[1:26:26] was not invited. Brother, let me tell
[1:26:28] you, you don't need to wait for any
[1:26:30] invitation to come and feed on the word.
[1:26:32] Amen. When you come to the word, if you
[1:26:33] are the word bride, you cannot be
[1:26:35] denied.
[1:26:37] Amen. You come into the Holy of Holies,
[1:26:40] you cannot be denied. Even on the
[1:26:41] rapture day, you will not be denied.
[1:26:43] Why? Because you are a part of Christ
[1:26:45] and he's a part of you. Amen. And you
[1:26:49] know, everybody thought the king is
[1:26:51] going to kill her. But what did the king
[1:26:53] say? The king looked at her and mercy
[1:26:55] filled his heart. Mercy said, "No, I
[1:26:58] cannot kill her." Why? Because she's a
[1:27:00] part of me. She's a worthy bride. The
[1:27:03] king looked at her and he raised his
[1:27:04] scepter. And when she touched it, she
[1:27:06] said, "Queen Esther, everybody shut up.
[1:27:08] Shut up. Don't tell me anything. Queen
[1:27:10] Esther, ask whatsoever you want,
[1:27:12] whatsoever you desire. Even to half of
[1:27:15] my kingdom, I will give it to you. Even
[1:27:17] to half of my kingdom, let me tell you,
[1:27:19] brother, we are going to get all the
[1:27:20] gifts plus more.
[1:27:24] We are going to have the kingdom
[1:27:26] itself."
[1:27:28] Amen. There is something I'm trying to
[1:27:30] get to. The overcomers are going to rule
[1:27:33] with him. They're going to share the
[1:27:35] kingdom with him. They're going to sit
[1:27:37] on a throne with him,
[1:27:40] the overcomers.
[1:27:42] H praise the name of the Lord.
[1:27:45] It will be granted only to the word
[1:27:47] bride. Remember, we have shown clearly
[1:27:50] all through the ages that even as Adam
[1:27:52] and Eve fell be because they left the
[1:27:54] word. So the Ephesian age fell by
[1:27:58] turning slightly from the word
[1:28:02] until with every age continuing to turn
[1:28:05] away, we have a final repudiation,
[1:28:10] a final rejection of the word by the
[1:28:12] church world system. Now in our age, we
[1:28:17] have a final rejection of the word. The
[1:28:20] denominations no longer desire the word.
[1:28:23] You will give them something in the
[1:28:24] scriptures. They would say those things
[1:28:27] have changed. We have moved. You have
[1:28:30] moved away from the word. But you see
[1:28:33] the bride is sticking closer to the
[1:28:35] word. This radician age ends in a
[1:28:37] blackout of the word
[1:28:40] thereby causing a departure of the Lord
[1:28:42] from the midst.
[1:28:44] He stands outside calling to his own who
[1:28:47] follow him by obedience to the word.
[1:28:50] After a short Oh my again on Sunday I
[1:28:54] finished here. Now I think I have about
[1:28:55] a few more minutes or maybe 20. So I'll
[1:28:58] go from here and continue a little bit.
[1:29:00] After a short and powerful demonstration
[1:29:04] of the spirit, this little hunted and
[1:29:08] persecuted group will go to be with
[1:29:10] Jesus. Now what group? The group that
[1:29:14] obeys the word. The word group. Amen.
[1:29:17] The message believing group. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:21] What will she experience? But the Bible
[1:29:24] says she will experience a short and
[1:29:27] powerful demonstration of the spirit.
[1:29:33] You know God whenever he wanted to have
[1:29:38] his people demonstrate the spirit, the
[1:29:40] power of the spirit, there was no
[1:29:43] demonstration unless there was pressure,
[1:29:46] unless there was need for it. God does
[1:29:48] not do things for a show. Forget about
[1:29:50] these things you see on television and
[1:29:52] you call that God. Forget about it. I'm
[1:29:55] not saying it is not. But I'm saying God
[1:29:56] doesn't work that way. You see that just
[1:30:00] to do it for a show. No, it's not a
[1:30:03] show. No wonder Brother Bam rejected
[1:30:05] television ministry. He said he didn't
[1:30:08] want anything for a show. There was TV
[1:30:11] at Islam, but he said, "I will not do
[1:30:12] it." He didn't even want to do anything.
[1:30:15] But God told him, "Record the sound. Let
[1:30:17] it be heard by the believers in the
[1:30:19] future. You know, because God knew you
[1:30:22] would want to hear the word in the days
[1:30:24] of the voice, the voice. So, you need to
[1:30:26] have the voice to hear what the
[1:30:28] messenger said. But you see what Laia is
[1:30:32] doing is just doing a demonstration, a
[1:30:34] demonstration
[1:30:36] to the world, for them like a public
[1:30:39] show to see the man of God, how powerful
[1:30:42] he is, how you know good he is. They
[1:30:44] will not do a miracle unless there is a
[1:30:45] camera.
[1:30:46] to watch the miracle.
[1:30:49] That's not how God operates. But you
[1:30:51] see, I'll tell you how God operates. The
[1:30:53] way God operates is when he is coming to
[1:30:57] combat a certain demonic power. When the
[1:31:01] devil rises as a flood, always the
[1:31:03] spirit of God will lift a standard to
[1:31:05] prove I am God.
[1:31:07] That's why, you know, as you see all
[1:31:10] these four horse riders coming in to to
[1:31:12] to attack the church of Jesus Christ,
[1:31:14] you know, beginning with a white horse
[1:31:15] rider to deceive the church and the
[1:31:17] persecution as we were going to I don't
[1:31:19] know if we'll get to it, you know, to
[1:31:21] see with the red horse rider, you know,
[1:31:23] and then turns on into into the the the
[1:31:25] black horse rider famine of the word and
[1:31:27] then, you know, the uh uh the pale horse
[1:31:29] rider uh which is the mixture of all
[1:31:32] these, you know, when the devil comes in
[1:31:34] like a flood like that in each of those
[1:31:37] four levels, God kept on lifting up a
[1:31:39] standard. You see, not for a public
[1:31:42] show, but for for for them to know, for
[1:31:45] the devil to know God is God and there
[1:31:47] is no one who can supersede him. His
[1:31:49] power is always the highest. So when he
[1:31:52] allows you to be persecuted, when he
[1:31:54] allows you to go through a suffering,
[1:31:56] when he allows something bad to happen
[1:31:58] is only only and only because he wants
[1:32:00] to manifest his great mover in power.
[1:32:03] Amen. He wants his name to be glorified.
[1:32:05] Therefore, what do you do as a believer?
[1:32:07] Don't be, you know, anxious for
[1:32:09] anything. The Bible says, "Be anxious
[1:32:11] for nothing." Amen. Because if God
[1:32:13] allows a bad situation to befall you,
[1:32:15] it's only because he wants his power to
[1:32:17] be made manifest in such a mighty way
[1:32:19] whereby everybody will say it is God who
[1:32:22] has done it.
[1:32:25] So you see in uh there is a man that can
[1:32:28] turn on the light. Brother Bam says when
[1:32:30] the persecution comes, don't get scared.
[1:32:35] There is a light
[1:32:37] said he would catch away his people. She
[1:32:40] will not go through the tribulation.
[1:32:44] She will never do it. He said she
[1:32:47] wouldn't. She will be caught away.
[1:32:53] He's not catching away because we are
[1:32:55] escaping. He's catching away. Let me
[1:32:57] tell you, we are not going to escape.
[1:32:58] No, no. We are going to go through it.
[1:33:02] Not the tribulation but the persecution.
[1:33:06] Amen. And we are going to overcome.
[1:33:10] How do you overcome in your Oh my God.
[1:33:12] May he reveal it to you. In your
[1:33:15] suffering, in your questioning, in your
[1:33:18] doubts, in whatever comes to you, you
[1:33:21] will not walk away from the word.
[1:33:25] You will remain faithful to the word.
[1:33:28] Your obedience to the word and suffering
[1:33:31] will show you have overcome
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:37] and each of us has something to overcome
[1:33:40] which is different from another.
[1:33:43] You see because the devil squeezed you
[1:33:45] up and then you say oh I'm giving up
[1:33:46] they will give up and go away. Apostle
[1:33:48] Paul said they went away from among us
[1:33:50] because they are not a part of us. But
[1:33:51] they if they were part of us they should
[1:33:53] have stayed but when the pressure was
[1:33:55] too high too hard they walked away.
[1:33:58] Brother never walk away from the word
[1:34:00] even when the pressure is too high. Stay
[1:34:02] in the word stay in the word. That's
[1:34:05] where your refuge is.
[1:34:07] Because persecution comes. Brother Bam
[1:34:10] says don't get scared. Amen. Persecution
[1:34:13] comes in different ways but don't get
[1:34:15] scared. There is a light and that light
[1:34:17] said is he will catch his people away.
[1:34:21] Amen. Many of those who have obeyed the
[1:34:22] word even through the tribulation. Not
[1:34:25] the great tribulation but I'm talking
[1:34:27] about the persecution.
[1:34:29] But I will tell you what, the bride will
[1:34:32] not go through the tribulation. No, she
[1:34:35] will never do it.
[1:34:37] The in the unfailing words of promises
[1:34:39] says God still remains true to his word.
[1:34:43] Both heavens and earth will pass away,
[1:34:45] but my word shall not pass away. God who
[1:34:47] can create spirals who can take away
[1:34:50] tumors. He is still the same God tonight
[1:34:54] for is the same yesterday and forever.
[1:34:56] Do you believe it? What am I saying this
[1:34:59] for? That it might encourage you to
[1:35:01] believe.
[1:35:03] Now that great gift others have tried to
[1:35:06] explain and say how it was done, this
[1:35:08] can't be explained. No, no, no, no.
[1:35:10] Listen. He says just wait. It will not
[1:35:13] be in the operation so perfectly now.
[1:35:17] Wait till the council of churches brings
[1:35:20] on that persecution.
[1:35:23] That's when it will happen. Now no,
[1:35:24] brother Bam had the other gifts, the the
[1:35:27] sign in the hand, the healing ministry.
[1:35:29] You remember that the designment, but
[1:35:32] now the what he's talking about is is
[1:35:34] talking about what I I I I told you
[1:35:36] there, the manifestation of the third
[1:35:38] pool. Because the the third pool is the
[1:35:40] opening of the word. But you see when
[1:35:43] the opening of the word comes, the devil
[1:35:45] is also going to come in and try to
[1:35:47] persecute the church and try to you know
[1:35:49] remember the the the pale horse rider is
[1:35:52] a mixture of all the others. The forces
[1:35:54] of of darkness are all going to rise in
[1:35:56] our generation and the devil would try
[1:35:58] to suffocate us and squeeze us out. But
[1:36:01] then brother Bam says you see this what
[1:36:04] what happened on this phase under the re
[1:36:06] the revealing or the revelation of the
[1:36:08] word what is going to happen he called
[1:36:10] it the uh here he's talking about it as
[1:36:13] the creation of squirrels
[1:36:15] taking away of tumors just by a spoken
[1:36:17] word this is a power that was unlike all
[1:36:21] the others he said the others he
[1:36:23] explained how it works but this one he
[1:36:25] cannot explain how it works
[1:36:27] because it cannot why can why can't he
[1:36:29] explain it because Because it can only
[1:36:31] be known by who? By by who? By by to
[1:36:34] whom that has it to whom it is resident
[1:36:37] in. You know, let me tell you, I cannot
[1:36:40] explain what is in you. I cannot explain
[1:36:42] what is in me unless there is pressure
[1:36:46] to provoke it. Are you getting my point?
[1:36:49] If there is pressure to provoke what is
[1:36:51] in me, I can't tell you that I know how
[1:36:53] to shout. I can't tell you that I know
[1:36:55] how to run. I can't even explain it. But
[1:36:57] if a lion came here, you'll just see me
[1:36:59] jumping and running like nothing.
[1:37:02] It is provoked by something. So brother
[1:37:04] Bam says what what is it is persecution.
[1:37:07] Don't get scared when persecution comes.
[1:37:09] And then he said wait till the world
[1:37:11] council of churches brings on the
[1:37:13] persecution.
[1:37:15] So could there be a time? Could there be
[1:37:17] a season when the council of churches
[1:37:19] brings a persecution? What is the
[1:37:21] council of churches? Listen brother
[1:37:23] Samuel. The council of churches is the
[1:37:24] combination of all the denominations
[1:37:26] together as a bundle. They're going to
[1:37:28] come in the name of the Lord and bundle
[1:37:30] together, but they're going to persecute
[1:37:31] the bride. Persecution. I do not know.
[1:37:34] I'm not saying they're going to kill us.
[1:37:35] It may be that they will exclude us and
[1:37:37] call us tributed and call us anything
[1:37:38] and call us, you know, whatever all
[1:37:40] names they want to call us couch or
[1:37:42] whatever it is that oh these are the
[1:37:44] problem. These are the problem. But you
[1:37:45] see when that begins to happen and I
[1:37:48] tell you what, the council of churches
[1:37:50] is now tightening up.
[1:37:53] things are tightening up right now. If
[1:37:54] you see what is happening in in Rome,
[1:37:58] brother Bannon prophesied
[1:38:00] the American pope and there's many
[1:38:03] things I can talk about on this but I'm
[1:38:05] cut short by time and I don't want to
[1:38:07] get away from my notes here so so much.
[1:38:09] But you see for the first time an
[1:38:10] American pope a fully American pope
[1:38:12] would become a pope leo. If you notice
[1:38:16] you we talk about the 68 million
[1:38:18] Christians who were killed by the Roman
[1:38:21] Catholic Church. It was done under popo.
[1:38:24] The church was persecuted under a pope
[1:38:27] claiming to be you know one who is
[1:38:30] speaking on behalf of god and all these
[1:38:32] things in Vatican. And now we see that
[1:38:35] the same thing after very many years I
[1:38:37] don't know how many exactly but a pop
[1:38:39] the world the cath church now has a pope
[1:38:42] from America. And why is it significant
[1:38:44] to be a pope from America? Because
[1:38:46] revelation 13 speaks of America.
[1:38:49] The council of churches cannot come into
[1:38:51] view without America. America here is
[1:38:53] representing the the confederation of
[1:38:54] all the other churches coming together.
[1:38:57] And you see, you're going to see the
[1:38:59] connection of these two. Look away in
[1:39:01] the message. Look away to Jesus. He
[1:39:02] says, "And if Christ lives in me, the
[1:39:04] works Christ, the works of Christ you
[1:39:07] will do. It's got to be." And what is
[1:39:09] Christ? The word say, "If ye abide in
[1:39:11] me, my word in you, then ye ask what you
[1:39:13] will, it will be done." Because the word
[1:39:15] is there. Just needs the light. and the
[1:39:18] light will makes it live. So now I am
[1:39:21] going to say something to you.
[1:39:24] I'm quoting that I haven't said all
[1:39:26] along and that is the thing that we have
[1:39:28] looked forward to for so long. This is
[1:39:31] 1963 now
[1:39:34] for at least many years four or five
[1:39:36] years or maybe longer. The third pool
[1:39:40] has now been vindicated
[1:39:44] and I'm sure you know what it is. Now
[1:39:47] remember that he did not say it as
[1:39:49] vindication of the third pool is the is
[1:39:52] the speaking things into existence right
[1:39:54] creating things into by the spoken word
[1:39:56] but the third pool itself is the opening
[1:39:58] of the word are you following me now
[1:40:00] remember there will never be an
[1:40:01] impersonation of that
[1:40:04] they could impersonate the first pool
[1:40:06] the second pool these things you can
[1:40:08] find them even in the denominations
[1:40:11] the healing the the signs the miracles
[1:40:13] the wonders the resurrection of the dead
[1:40:14] and all the things right but now when it
[1:40:16] comes to the third pool. He said you can
[1:40:19] it can never be impersonated.
[1:40:23] Why? Because it is a resident thing in a
[1:40:27] believer who Amen. believes in the word.
[1:40:31] It can only be provoked. You know what
[1:40:34] the vindication of it can only be
[1:40:35] provoked by the persecution which is
[1:40:37] turned on by the forces and pressures of
[1:40:40] the world. But you see, it is only
[1:40:42] provoking something which is in you.
[1:40:44] Amen. So you can't impersonate it
[1:40:48] because it cannot be now it is in
[1:40:50] existence. Now it is in existent. This
[1:40:52] is 1963. He says it is already here. I
[1:40:55] am warned of this that soon right at
[1:40:58] this time now it's just happened. So it
[1:41:01] could identify its presence among you.
[1:41:04] See but
[1:41:07] it will not be used in a great way. This
[1:41:10] is 1963.
[1:41:12] It wouldn't be used at that time in a
[1:41:14] great way until when
[1:41:17] until this council, we already know what
[1:41:20] C is talking about, begins to tighten
[1:41:22] up.
[1:41:24] And when it does, the Pentecostals and
[1:41:28] so forth can almost impersonate anything
[1:41:31] that can be done. But when that time
[1:41:34] comes, and I want to say that time is
[1:41:37] now, we are living right in that season.
[1:41:42] He says when that time comes, when the
[1:41:45] squeeze comes down,
[1:41:48] then you will see. Tell your neighbor,
[1:41:51] you will see
[1:41:53] what you've seen temporarily being
[1:41:55] manifested in the fullness of his power.
[1:42:00] The bride is coming into this hour.
[1:42:02] friends, you you can stay in your, you
[1:42:06] know, milk, but I'm telling you, you
[1:42:07] better get into the meat of the word
[1:42:09] because the bride is getting into this
[1:42:11] place.
[1:42:13] And everyone knows that for a certain as
[1:42:15] the first was identified, so has the
[1:42:17] second been identified. And if you think
[1:42:20] really closely, you who are spiritual
[1:42:22] and as the Bible said here is to him
[1:42:24] that has wisdom. The third pool is
[1:42:27] properly identified. We know where it
[1:42:29] is. So the third pool is here.
[1:42:32] This will be the thing that to my
[1:42:34] opinion I don't say the Lord tells me
[1:42:36] this. He says to his opinion this will
[1:42:39] be the thing that will start the
[1:42:41] rapturing faith for the going away.
[1:42:47] There is coming a time upon this nation
[1:42:50] to where this nation is going to
[1:42:51] exercise all the power that the first
[1:42:53] beast had before it. He's talking about
[1:42:54] America exercising the first power of
[1:42:58] the first beast. The first beast is
[1:42:59] Rome. And now America exercising the
[1:43:01] power because remember it's the image to
[1:43:03] the beast. The image to the beast is the
[1:43:05] curse of churches which is represented
[1:43:07] you know in this uh revelation 13. Now
[1:43:11] he says to where this nation is going to
[1:43:13] say all power that the first beast had
[1:43:14] before it which was pagan Rome when it
[1:43:17] become papa Rome. See this nation will
[1:43:20] do that. Revelation 13 explains it
[1:43:24] plainly. received power and spoke like a
[1:43:26] dragon and exercised all the dragon
[1:43:28] power of the dragon had before him and
[1:43:31] the dragon is Rome always so don't you
[1:43:33] see Roman denomination a mark potenta
[1:43:35] denomination an image unto the beast
[1:43:39] making a power that will force all
[1:43:41] protestants like a union
[1:43:44] you will have to be into this council of
[1:43:46] churches or you won't be able to have
[1:43:49] fellowship time will come when they say
[1:43:52] no more fellowship in a in I was a
[1:43:54] pastor in Ethiopia for close to um uh
[1:43:57] you know uh 8 9 years but I had to leave
[1:44:00] and come back here. Why? Because you
[1:44:03] know you you had to be having theology
[1:44:06] certificate to be a pastor there. And
[1:44:08] now they said to the foreigners now it's
[1:44:10] coming to the locals and soon they are
[1:44:12] going to say well you need to be a
[1:44:14] member of the council of churches to run
[1:44:15] a church. So they get to close down all
[1:44:18] the other churches which are not a
[1:44:19] member of the council of churches. And
[1:44:21] let me tell you, remember this, the
[1:44:22] bride cannot join those kinds of
[1:44:23] churches
[1:44:25] because it is the image unto the beast
[1:44:27] like unto the beast. You see, you will
[1:44:30] have to be into these kinds of churches
[1:44:31] or you want to have to f to have
[1:44:32] fellowship. And that's where the
[1:44:33] persecution now begins to come in. Even
[1:44:36] here it is going to come. Even here it
[1:44:37] is going to come all over the world.
[1:44:39] This is going to be a worldwide move.
[1:44:41] Think the signs are all over us. We need
[1:44:43] to understand before the council of
[1:44:45] churches built before they even started
[1:44:47] open shop brother Bham prophesied there
[1:44:50] will be a council of churches which will
[1:44:51] be a mandate for all the denominations
[1:44:53] to join and the other denomination said
[1:44:56] ah brother Bham is joking we will not
[1:44:57] join if if it starts it started and they
[1:44:59] joined
[1:45:02] and now it is here by prophecy and he
[1:45:03] said it will be the image like unto the
[1:45:05] beast so this we are walking and living
[1:45:07] in prophecy friends.
[1:45:10] Hallelujah.
[1:45:11] All right, I have 90 minutes. I need I
[1:45:13] need I I need to close. Now he says it's
[1:45:15] practically that way. Now you can't go
[1:45:17] to a church and preach unless you have a
[1:45:19] fellowship card or some identification.
[1:45:21] And now on persons like ourselves, we
[1:45:24] are going to be cut out like that
[1:45:25] altogether. That's exactly because they
[1:45:27] they won't be able to do it. It's
[1:45:29] tightening. He says it is tightening.
[1:45:31] And then when that time comes and the
[1:45:33] and the press comes to a place where
[1:45:36] where you will be pressed out, then
[1:45:38] watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a
[1:45:41] few minutes.
[1:45:42] Watch the third pull. Then see it will
[1:45:46] be absolutely
[1:45:48] to the total lost. It will be for the
[1:45:50] bride and the church.
[1:45:54] The third pool is already here as in it
[1:45:55] is the opening of the word. But the
[1:45:57] vindication of it, brother, that's what
[1:46:00] we are entering into in this season.
[1:46:04] Listen, you see now we are closer than
[1:46:07] it seems to be. I don't know when, but
[1:46:09] it's real real close. This is 1963. How
[1:46:13] many years ago? More than almost 100
[1:46:15] years.
[1:46:16] I may be I may be building a platform
[1:46:19] for somebody else to step on. He doesn't
[1:46:22] know. He says maybe it is in the future.
[1:46:24] And then here is what I really touched
[1:46:26] me. Listen, I'm going to read it for
[1:46:28] you. I may be taken before that time.
[1:46:32] He's not here. But he as a prophet, he
[1:46:36] saw it. He declared it. He said it. He
[1:46:38] said at that time it was vindicated so
[1:46:41] that people can know it is here. How was
[1:46:43] it vindicated? By him creating and
[1:46:45] speaking squids into existence. By him
[1:46:48] calling out a tumor and a tumor, God
[1:46:51] goes into the stomach of of his wife and
[1:46:52] a tumor disappears.
[1:46:55] by but by him you know giving fish life
[1:46:58] and he says God has already vindicated
[1:47:00] it in a short time right now just for
[1:47:01] now for us to know it is here for us to
[1:47:03] see yet but I'm telling it is coming in
[1:47:05] the future I don't know whether I would
[1:47:06] be here I may not be there at that time
[1:47:08] he's not here at this time but this is
[1:47:10] the moment it's the season we've been
[1:47:12] waiting for
[1:47:13] and he says and and and that time may be
[1:47:16] this coming week that the Holy Spirit
[1:47:17] will come and bring Jesus Christ he he
[1:47:19] may come next week he may yet he may
[1:47:22] come yet tonight I don't know when he
[1:47:24] will come he doesn't tell us that and I
[1:47:26] want to say this I've never said it
[1:47:27] before but according to scripture
[1:47:29] according to what he said 30 years ago
[1:47:32] 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river
[1:47:35] down there in 1933 rather what he said
[1:47:39] everything has happened just exactly I
[1:47:42] may not do it but this message I may not
[1:47:46] do it the prophet now is saying I may
[1:47:48] not do it but this message will
[1:47:50] introduce Jesus Christ to the world
[1:47:53] Amen. For as John the Baptist was sent
[1:47:56] to around the first coming, so is this
[1:47:58] message going to fall around the second
[1:48:00] coming. And John said, "Behold, the lamb
[1:48:02] of God that takes away the sins of the
[1:48:03] world." So you see, and I know it will.
[1:48:06] He says, "I know it will." The message
[1:48:08] will go on. The message is right here
[1:48:11] 100 years after. Still going on. God
[1:48:14] moving, God speaking, God calling, a
[1:48:17] word bride,
[1:48:19] forming into a group of overcomers.
[1:48:23] those going to overcome this year. We
[1:48:25] are going to overcome by the word.
[1:48:28] Amen. We can we can just stand and we'll
[1:48:30] continue from there on Sunday. The Lord
[1:48:32] God bless you and I pray that he makes
[1:48:34] these things real to your heart,
[1:48:36] friends. There there's a lot there's a
[1:48:38] lot more we need to get into. I just
[1:48:40] pray that you will get a hunger.
[1:48:43] Musicians can come. I pray you will get
[1:48:44] a hunger, a thirst, a desire for more of
[1:48:48] God. that that you you come to a place
[1:48:51] friend that you will walk away from all
[1:48:53] the distractions and the things that uh
[1:48:55] easily beset you. You you look to what

[1:48:59] putting you or taking you into. There's

[2:04:02] already gone around. Um many of you
[2:04:05] already know of it as usual. Uh all the
[2:04:09] young people here make sure I know
[2:04:11] brother A streaming. Uhhuh. So I know
[2:04:16] even those who are not here will be able
[2:04:17] to hear what I have read. Make
[2:04:20] arrangements to be there. The dates
[2:04:22] again are
[2:04:26] I just want to read the date the dates
[2:04:28] again arrival is 4th September
[2:04:31] uh to Monday 8th September. So it's a

[2:04:41] these are wonderful meetings and please
[2:04:43] never miss such such programs.

[2:04:49] supposed to be our camp speaker, one of
[2:04:51] our camp speakers in our recent youth
[2:04:53] camp and he couldn't make it because his
[2:04:56] visa was not approved. Uh but then he
[2:04:58] made it in the Easter convention and I
[2:04:59] see he's coming back again. Uh I think
[2:05:02] he's an associate of brother Wayne
[2:05:03] Lawson who uh was also going to be our
[2:05:06] main camp speaker but did not make it.
[2:05:07] So it's important that uh you we

[2:05:14] when we have meetings like these
[2:05:17] youth youth camp meetings we know that
[2:05:19] this church we our vision is really
[2:05:22] mainly to help the young people and so
[2:05:24] when something like this comes up we
[2:05:26] want to be fully participating in that
[2:05:28] as we have been doing in the past so God
[2:05:31] bless you I think we'll see as a church
[2:05:33] on Sunday maybe we can also be able to
[2:05:35] pledge something towards it and then you
[2:05:38] as an individual when you are going take
[2:05:40] as much as you can to
[2:05:44] uh support others. If you want to
[2:05:46] support and the things that I've read,
[2:05:48] make sure you have it. God bless you so
[2:05:50] much,
