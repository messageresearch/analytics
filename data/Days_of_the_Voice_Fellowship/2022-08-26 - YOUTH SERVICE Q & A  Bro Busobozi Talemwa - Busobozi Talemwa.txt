========================================

[Music] hallelujah [Music] is is [Music] i know [Music] one day when i was low [Music] oh [Music] they died upon i know [Music] so i want to greet you all in the name of jesus once again i had a good lunch i want us to clap for our cooks today [Applause] uh the food you ate amerimori day was scooped by mrs arinda they fumbled so i want to say god bless you come on myself a little bit i want to pick my uh wife and baby hospital my son and you know when you walk into a hospital with your wife in bad pains and then you come out with a baby and ha it is the grace of god [Music] um we will go to business right away because of time again again god bless you church i have a burning testimony because it's a burning testimony i don't know what it is you can stand right there and you get praise god church gave birth to jesse the father of david [Music] i was wrong that was not rahab it was uh rude yeah you know sometimes when preachers when we are preaching some sometimes you can give a wrong quote and speak a wrong name and place things wrongly but i believe each person who is spiritual they are able to read between the lines [Music] so it is the person who wrote this thank you for your correction um actually it was ruth that um if you go to the book of ruth mitchell you'll notice in chapter four 4 verse 21 [Music] they a okay so now i have a question here the nature i know he says can i pay my time to the person that uh asked this question but i want to say no you cannot know we as believers should help the needy finger to the book of malacca if you can go quit there quickly malachi singha together i'll give more details in the little videos i told you that i would be able to know that but never cause the overtime viewers but if you go to malachi chapter 3 are you there malacca is the last book in the old testament [Music] yet cast with a cast for ye have robbed me even this whole nation so then here on verstappen it tells you what you should do and how you should do it me now here we said the lord of hosts for if i will not open your you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it even where are you supposed to bring it when i build a tower where why store house what is kept in the storehouse food not so similar so the word is the one that you receive from goddess storehouse whenever you come to church and you hear the word and if you have another question out of this uh what i will say you again send it to me i will still address it on the video i'm going to try and be um one hour and a half or so and therefore every christian buddhism christian and tight is 10 percent of our income 10 of our salary because not all people receive salaries you know but everyone receives income you see when you receive income maybe someone has given you a gift [Music] i spoke i think about a few weeks ago i spoke on taithes and offerings that has asked this please go and listen to that now your tithe you pay your tithers to your church your pastor that did not get any inheritance god said don't do not worry you you are mine and so you see your tribe the tribe of levi you your mind receive to the levites and to the people of the delivered should stand in for the lord universe so when you for instance if you pay your trip to me that type money cutting entirely and i use it the wrong way that's none of your business i'll have to answer for that because remember that ministers pastors must how but there is no obligation for any person to account to you how he used type and that's why some of these mega church pastors have decided to abuse it but i think that gives you a a picture they know they should question and i'll be able if you want the details on this subject please go and listen to the summon i preached on tithies and offerings it's on youtube and also on the podcast every single someone is preaching on the road and you're like oh you're preaching so well and then you take your time no and i wish i could go in detail and read you a few questions but uh if you are if what you should ask them if it's okay for them now singing but didn't take it so that's why it's good for you to write your name whatever you do but still i'll give more detail later okay now i have another question here from brother sam that's somewhere we have several songs i don't know but not over some of them you can see how can a person control his or her feelings maybe when tempted or maybe not yet i think that they're meaning and i i'm requesting you people to switch up your phones if you can't please it says how can a person control i think they mean if how can a person control his or her feelings when tempted or not yeah obama [Music] you cannot have cell phones i'll ask you a question many times you can do something don't look at me as if you [Music] self-control but you see in your control tower all the students of god have a control tower [Music] therefore satan is controlling you if it's god is controlling now what is in your soul remember all of us for now we are born with a mad soul we are born in a perverted way whether we are children of god or not meaning whether we are serpent seed or the seed of god how many news so in other words serpent city cannot accept the world exactly because there is nothing in them there is no seed jumped you could get converted to the lies there are three stages of you of grace that god will take you through the way so it brings you out of the world and we baptize you in his name but you still have the desires which i know what you used to have yet you are in charge that's why when you get baptized and then you disappear from fellowship baptism you have to remain there and go through more process no you're [Music] i'll make it's just like the desire [Music] child they have repented of it there is still something else controlling and let me tell you that desire may remain there for the rest of your life now but the only thing that changes you mentioned is what is on your control tower as the moment you receive the holy ghost he begins controlling your desires so we continue living between desires [Music] child hallelujah amen from that moment you are never the same again will you be tempted oh yes but you can control you [Music] [Applause] from that moment hallelujah he's on the control tower he's the one guiding you and leading you yeah when you are tempted never he's your strength and he gives you victory in every temptation hallelujah man the answer to this the only way you can control receive the holy ghost said how have you been um how how are you i'm gambled yeah i've been fine since i got saved and i was filled with the holocaust not jesus it black your connection with them is based on the things it will just put you down flat each time anyway but if you are incredible you are a new creation the odd life passes away and you receive another another another being to control you in your life is it those drugs in a case it's for a good tv okay please the question is drugs is it bad to use drugs chibi what the brother asks for hallelujah i mean so now anything drugs we have a doctor here a medical doctor wanna truly know mr it is not many of the drugs we use in the hospital you know actually most of them are gonna really come from houses god made with catholic but what happens to people the devil i'm answering a question here no i hope you people are not misunderstanding this they will be follow me closely but it is the devil satani that perverts what god has created foreign young people you are very quiet someone would do it and they would call it prostitution never cheated fornication someone else would do it and it would [Music] me is it bad to use drugs in case it's for a good reason if the first question i'll ask is what type of drug video that are gonna charge if it's medical drugs but if it's for medical reasons then i don't even think it's a question because it's prescribed by a doctor and it's going to be in limits with you and someone has convinced you that you see this hub to be known when you take it you will you will become intelligent is that a good reason surely lana is it a good reason song and truth no please answer me be honest with yourself if someone tells you taking wit will make you wise don't go deep into the thing just understand my questions is it a good reason yes it's a good reason so the person asked is it but use drugs it's for good reason so if i say yes it's not wrong then they will go and take it because someone has told them it's actually going to make you white yeah okay and he will take the weed to it is wrong for a christian to go the scripture says that we should not um we should not fashion ourselves after the world champion if i don't believe that is not right because it's going to end up in um um in getting addicted to the drugs you're going to come here at church high foreign your good worry and sometimes you're going to be really low or more very well you don't take it you take it again you become really hard our guru that's getting addicted was taking work that you i don't know it's mixed with his blood or something yeah two kids say that he got the name so the doctor told him something that is not really good for you as a christian a christian must have a spiritual thinking filter um there is a medicine called what would they reach i'm not sure i'm not a medical person but i think it has a lot of weird need or something some of us [Music] no comments it shows that you are not believing that god can heal you why don't you take something with such a side effect and then you're like oh no it's okay as long as the doctor's prescribed a baby the concept is nothing that god has made is bad that's why we should we should um you know flee from parents of evil embedded [Music] [Music] so i believe it's not right for believers to take drugs if i was the one and i was prescribed to take weed i don't know how many will do that i believe our god is not so little that he would have to stoop so low on [Music] so brother i believe when you say drugs i meant believe you said the weed because what we they talked about avoid those things what can i do when in school and people are praying the rosary while kneeling am i supposed to kneel like them um to be politically correct but you cannot bow before idols if they let them kneel other people why do you even stay there where they are move away if you cannot move forward [Music] [Music] who have families [Music] is [Music] so if they invite me peter they make sure there is no alcohol on them if there is alcohol they will never even dare to invite each other because they know i will not go come on they thought i was joking as time went by i realized i don't care never get on this fire if anything stands between me and god chindi shall never see me that walker i take god as my prayer so he's number one in my life everything else is so that's what you have to do in your society everywhere you are [Music] i have a lot of because i want to read for each question but i'm just going to go through as much as i can and and then i will go through each of them with them as i promised you i will make those videos god bless you church this one is [Music] i don't understand the question why it's people oh this this one needed to have some more grammar why it's people company about the believers to stay with unbelievers they understand the question why people why is it people company about the believers why is it that people complain about the believers is that the question is okay so and then what what we is there a problem with them says it's easy to stay with unbelievers why did the world act reject what did the world believe us is it good when you marry an unbeliever before getting this message of the hour if i don't understand them um stay with unbelievers why did the world reject okay now maybe you are asking why the what does the word reject believers russians it is simple christ was rejected so they will reject us thing about the world and see you engage if you do what they want you are their friends if you don't you are there you see you cannot if everybody is going to academy for example if everybody is going for a disco i met another do you think you are going to dress as you dress when you are coming to church and go with them again even when you do neighbors they will not be happy with you you would have to dress like them oh you know you would have to dress a trouser oh yeah malefice or a minuscule mini if you're a young man you would have to do the haircut or you know you would have to um you know these days even younger men are using makeup they are putting pins in their ears but they can't help you what the world is standing there and and you see you would have to do the work do rejects the devils and the demons in the world and the demons in the world that is imaginable fear the god in us and that's the reason why it's very hard for a true believer to accompany himself with an unbeliever but if you find yourself with them all the time neither way hallelujah how can if you are not a cockroach well that will change how can you accompany with cockroaches oh you don't you better navy age is it possible to love darkness surely loves you so much and then is it good when you marry an unbeliever before getting the message of the hour chirunji [Music] [Music] as a matter of fact even if they have two waves amen doesn't want to matter true for example [Music] if i [Music] for instance if a girl believes the message um what about kirizov and she hears what i preached today in the morning that she has to be a virtuous woman to repent my husband before marriage is for not to be no queen and yes and oh what can i do now i got nothing yeah i was i did not know that notice i leave you without knowing now because but now i've believed that the indicator is there and then you don't go again ahead with that kind of like because you see and when you are married you don't say i will not tell my husband before i marry because it was before i believed [Music] if someone was you know moving around in the world and they get hiv oh my when someone has several wives and believes that car will remain with them they will remain with the wives but it's a scar in their lives and they can't be beacons they can't be passed why right because of that scar in their lives says the word of god says that a deacon is a pastor no more must be a husband of one arena so this one has some scars some wipes he had and so it's not good in that in that context and you had a girlfriend you repent of that and [Music] [Laughter] [Music] maybe after a while god has desired for her to be a believer if god has desired for her to be your future wife that's really in the hands of the lord amen oh my so i'm watching the time i want to stop at six and it's number five uh this is i think a young sister she wrote something i love god and all that again i got it okay so under what circumstances can i believe or marry an unbeliever you see the prophet says brother you have to give me more sound okay he says that uh no circumstance oh me say again some people are not being attentive will you please listen to me the prophet said under no circumstances [Music] [Music] on what [Music] how can you walk together except they be a great let us read that question show me what this is a good one the book of corinthians chapter 6 verse 14. be praise the lord come and muslim be ye not equally yoked together with unbelievers you know to to to to yoke to unequal powers oh good [Music] [Music] so they cannot be equal they should never agree they can never dig and your form will not be allowed why it that is that is not healthy [Music] lunch i would rather work you preach to them let god convert them again and then [Music] in many circumstances they do not have an idea to marry them when they are preaching to them [Music] those young people a bunch of trips i didn't know good times and then uh and then uh and then when when she uh when he went category after one month my daughter was coming he had read it he realized it was the truth unity and this brother organ is now a preacher of the message and is married to this sister yeah [Music] from the bible what punishment has god ever given to a church or a pastor or a prophet who misuses or mismanages the tithe and offerings of the church musumba go to what everywhere where are you go to what dave you could have come to me which which punishment has god ever given to a church catholic area or a pastor obama or a prophet who misuses all mismanagers the price and offerings of the church i believe my brother and i have your name here but i'll not mention it i don't know where you are and you really have guts to put your name on on such questions you see i believe you've got to ask that because you found that we are mismanaging funds here with your center in the bible my baby why do you uh servants of god who mismanage the fact and the most notable ones or the ones that are known so much is the family of ellie when you're game eddie was a faithful man what is children we are not faithful don't take the offerings it's for themselves and we shall give accountability now those of you in my family know me very well to learn and appreciate it you must learn ordinary accountability because even in heaven name of god we are going to give accountability i give you this body now questions this body now who are mobility going to give accountability how did you use it [Music] but here father you know [Music] some of these questions i'll spend some good time on them and give more prescriptions brother used to say the statement read between the lines what does it mean now that means that not everything he says is the way he says it to the gaza and the scent of your navigable but the spiritual understands together praise without mentioning the act that was done but then again you have to read between the lines now you got to go you're not taking it out you know no you understand what exactly i'm trying to count many times i've been preaching and i said the scripture says soul is the way of an adulteress woman how many have read between the lines so according to you what did she do did you read between the lines and what did yes [Music] hallelujah i mean and so then you get into the details of that that's what it means to read between the lines sometimes if you visit somebody reading between the lines teacher name all right brother you're married you are married one day visit brother wanga's home rumor since you didn't understand i have to explain to you now and when i visited your home his wife gave me juice a glass of dries very nice and so i noticed brother ruanga turned to his wife and she moved away from there and brought a glass for him oh now m foreign [Music] [Music] come on come on i will not mention your name i have it here i'll answer you you do not do do you know what it means how many know what that means this job is how many can explain who can explain that yes yes so you've been in a situation homeopathy is our mind oh you've got faith in those of your faith and some people dream after stones subconscious and the consciousness their subconscious is very close to their sub uh their subconscious you can be there talking about and then in a moment she explains you what you are saying and she will take like five minutes to explain that another thing will come to pass exactly oh a vision is the same thing that happens when you are dreaming you know they just see themselves in church worshiping never seen them others they see things which come to pass others you know many different things i mean what do we see in our subconscious finger drivers and others don't really dream about it but it doesn't mean they don't have a subconscious mind it does we have each of us not to be the name between here is what i wanted to say there is something here that the bible says what are watching too and a bible i want to read it quickly for you in the book of uh 12 romans 12. and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good an acceptable and perfect will of god [Music] to show you what i'm saying way back when you sleep you will begin to dream those things as if you are actually it is actually in real reality whatever happened to any of you what do i challenge to say you know you maybe someone is preaching you slept while hearing that and you you're hearing while sleeping so you see yourself in the church and maybe many other things will happen there may be a dream from the time i received the holy ghost i have never had even one nightmare sit down come here completely nothing and all the dreams mind if you if you die a fornicator something happened if you sleep but wherever a foreign [Music] [Music] the moment you receive the holy ghost you hear the word of god and many people when they believe about [Music] actually have been even just conscious happening in the spiritual world so you see even in your concierge [Music] and in an emergency of dreams then there's also a lot of um a lot of discrepancies because you've been thinking about something and this is really what happens most of the time but until someone's conscious is washed and cleansed by the word of god under their mind renewed then god takes control and then you he begins to show you things to come catch you i'm not going to go call a baby into every night yeah he says when he the holy ghost comes he will do what show these dreams are only showing you the status of your spiritual life now i can see you need to enter into a stage of sanctification how do you do that by praying my question is about marriage and you don't have a name oh okay as far as seeking god's kingdom and his righteousness first a concern is marriage also god is righteousness it depends on the context you're asking i believe before you get married you must have a relationship with god fast the marriage will not take away the banning there are many things that married people do what would have been to know india from baby back that god again so i believe before you get married first have christ as your headships remember you will also be the head of your wife can you now have to be ahead of somebody when you don't have a headache you don't come to church a a a a a a family and guide your wife be the pastor of your home remember as a pastor in the house as a husband no matter the pastor of your home how can you do that if you cannot receive a breakthrough in prayer now before you get married as a christian or message believer which is the correct way of marrying that god once i know that there are some people who say they are the ones who tell you who to marry man they must make oh mature and i've spoken on the part of the spirit so you must be my true spirit number two you must be ready and we found that to be a big problem [Music] they think they're spiritually mature they think they uh they they are physically mature i don't want the normal video a place they call their own he doesn't even have a mattress signing so you should not you have no business talking to anybody's daughter why do you want to talk about whatever there is a difference between dating and courtship yes no believers they do court they they do caught you know you you begin a conversation it's an intention to get married [Music] remember while you were doing all that you were praying you do it by faith by the time you finish god will bring that to you and then when you get done you just continue with the prayers [Music] um you must be careful with spreading that word i love you number [Music] you want to be with them where you're going to be tonight don't say no it's not like that no that's it you're just wasting your time i'm telling you you ask me how does a christian do it i'm showing you so then once you are ready we already prepared again so don't after everything has been done now you're not told me sisters are coming you're coming into church or democracy in a youth meeting like this you're looking down all the time you can say that god bless your sister you are not man it simply means against them you must begin looking out only for a younger lady of christ you are not looking for i'm simply saying chain number you know what you want on your heart that's priority you are looking for the character of christ in a woman so so what's up is it does she have sacredness around her yeah as a woman she's not you know you know the way she behaves around me someone who dresses like a believer if you see a boy marrying a girl with all the makeups and everything and yeah i don't know just not that man is not also saved marry you see then then so you begin looking out for christian beautiful praise god hear myself but if she's not oh that's simulanji that's okay as long as the character is guys she will be beautiful sometimes some people marry some people and they begin splashing them all over what's stopping you youtube oh my queen oh my beauty oh and then when you look at him [Music] so it wouldn't hurt you if you came to me for concern right because many of the times if a young man came to me the next you know i always find out when they come to me after speaking together out there usually doesn't end well [Music] this has happened on several occasions and he he spoke to me i'm interested in sisters and several times it was found his sister was already engaged even to get [Music] [Music] can you help me can you talk to her on my behalf you know someone asked me to talk to her to mamamoo go there wait again if they refuse you now just gather yourself up and wait for another opportunity but if they are the right ones for you they can never refuse it hallelujah praise the name of the lord and of course when you start talking then you go into courtship at some point the pastor gets to know what happens tomorrow then you announce your engagement [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and that's all i can say can you forgive someone who tries to fail your life [Music] what should i do i have no job please be the one who wrote this yeah kindly make sure you come and see it because you need some concept [Music] surrounding this case i don't know what to say i don't know what you're going through cement choice my childhood please come and see me okay now there is another question here okay our time is up can i can i continue a little bit more [Music] all right so let us continue for 30 minutes um this is another brother okay here's another question here the bible talks about our time for everything don't you think one needs to involve himself or herself in what she or he is supposed to do at the time don't you think i know how do we know that it is time for this and that together and he was quoting ecclesiastes chapter three verse one yeah i do not know on the on what perspective but it is true there is time for everything there are times whatever you say that and i regret that i can these days i've tried my best i'm still trying to find those times but it's becoming increasingly hard abuse someone what would he say that when again [Music] and just get into those thickets oh i remember those moments now there are many things that have come into my life that have made it increasingly hard for me to be the way i was then yes themselves are not easy to be found even i'm not in the place where i used to be careers and uh if now i went with my car and i parked it somewhere on the road into a bush there are things that you can do sometimes [Music] at some levels in your life you may never have another opportunity and you will continue with your work with god you know you have nobody asking you those questions but maybe your mother maybe your mother has one son as you grow older if you decide to go somewhere in a bush to pray for for two days who will pursue you organ brother alex if it is get up the person asking this question he said something that that when you skip something it comes back again to you that one turns into another corner as if to say that if you don't play football now you'll play it when you get older of football again there was a time although i could say that i really love football now you're gonna call me peter but not really a fan of my friends who are playing it whenever i would play and i've never been a footballer when you go to america now burgundy america the god of america america is a woman entertainment in america america they used to preach against me the bible says we should not fashion ourselves after the world but it would not fight anger and see so most of these things are really entertainment and maybe i'll be giving more details on that and all the histories of some of these things there's some games and entertainment that is not not bad well and i'm not saying that believers should not have any sort of entertainment but you must watch what type of entertainment do you engage in be cheery if you could send yourself away i think i've answered this question right so i have another question here is rude still here lucy where is that oh she forgot to ask the question why god loves people but he wants people to save really i'll need her to clarify to save him or to serve them i don't really understand i'll need ask yeah okay um i was asked this question by one of my denominational friends i need clarification on this verse foreign are you blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man and at the hand of every man's brother will i require the life of man a [Music] [Music] [Music] of this scripture i don't understand the context um but um the scripture that comes to my mind right now if there is somebody talking about requiring blood on your head yes that might as well be by itself verse 5 might mean something else i'll need to have a deeper set on that but now there is another scripture that i wanted to look at okay i also don't see it quickly here but it says if you see someone doing wrong and you do not want them no time their blood will be required upon your head oh my god so that's the scripture that is coming close to this but i need to study um i'll surely deal with this on the video the question was why god needs blood of human lives this is not interpret your interpretation of this verse the person he is asking the question was why does god need blood of human lives i do not believe that god is demanding for human life i remember one day i was preaching and i said god requires blood yet the only sacrifice he has never asked for his human life of christ so i don't think that's the interpretation but i need to if you are it would have done me well who asked this question i never said are you here who are you i know okay so i will need your name can you put your name on take a kid i will need to be sure to send you the answer uh all right so there's another question here um no i don't believe that i lost okay i i will not just justice to this one again because i want to deal with them a little more but let's go a little over it okay and i love the questions you asked by the kid and they're quite deep as well says what did jesus mean when he said that why did what did jesus mean when he said that the last sh the last shall come first and the first last years many are called but few are chosen today another place in scripture where it speaks of those that were fast and those that were last but they all received the same rewards and speaking of this we can look at the church edges from the very first church all those were sleeping sleeping but the question is will they receive the reward yes they will receive the right phone name but yes we which are live [Music] but the bible says we who are alive are and remain i believe i'm a father here's what the scripture says we shall not hinder them that are asleep he says that the sound when the last trump the sounding of the last trump of god again the content of the same bible did it for you the dead in christ are right about freedom christopher is okay that we wish our life and remain we shall be caught up to your quality one to meet with the lord together with them in the christian so but i know there is another aspect to that question and i'll get to it uh later [Music] [Music] but you did not know better it's just like the many vowels we make before we believe we make vows with gods you will run man and you make a vow no right either and they tell you to wear something every movie you will run man you make many vowels those vowels are made maybe christ sets you free from all those vows that you put in [Music] he is displeased the bible says he has a right i know you tell her you will not marry me now according to the bible the father physical father can do that eeries because you had made a vow okay you are actually set free from verb amen pastor is it possible for a person filled with the holy ghost to get a demon in him absolutely i do not believe i don't have to [Music] and you need to be delivered and receive the holy phenomenon right what if i like an unbeliever who is well charactered is well and i sent another brother to preach to her name i'm um he [Music] [Music] now but still have and i remember when i was in school there were not even summers before i'm does not [Music] is will because of a strong feeling you have a good sell everything he she's not she doesn't have christ crystal so it's not good character because there is a simpson knowing that behavior is as a human being but wait a moment make her hungry that's when you realize she has no character right and so is it brother says the man without the holy ghost is like a beast you see so friend what i would do change the color i'll then go to this car do it myself cuz they will not call anger i would always gather myself to preach so that i can give her a word this is what happened to kangaroo i would always talk about especially when you you can talk about trousers about women oh i would say that was a cat which is putting her nails [Music] but if it happens to be right never change the truth and she has a seed of god in her heart but if you are so much beaten by her name you know because if you cannot witness to somebody over the summer to because they they are attracting you it means even the spirit you were in against a normal is not the right spirit you're already overtaken and you need to come to the pastor hallelujah you are going to really pray for them and you're going to preach to them not not have feelings for them praise the lord too all right i answered that properly are you satisfied about that is it a mast that a black should not marry a white chapter oh it was just an advice and behind here america oh no he wrote something and he crossed it i mentioned about that one there's an extra did the prophet advise us not and they changed his mind he said is it a mask so you already know what the prophet says what the prophet says all right i i i i if you want my opinion i'll give you my opinion but if you want the word you have to what never boy i got a chicken already we only have one dress fetullina fetus that's a christian right right i mean you can as well say we have only one human race but brother because god doesn't like me god is not a mixer and he doesn't like mexico yes you know they're not white they're not black [Music] [Music] and he loves them all and he doesn't want you to cross it will go besides him let it be in his beauty like you would have shouted a man somebody said africa every young man of hollywood all they would do they dreamed but that's the the spirit of our of our continent can i would i be right if i say it is not the spirit of christ right all right so i think that answers that but on on those on that uh i answered again by answering you that we have one race and that is at the christian race you want to be a mixer is it good for a sister to hug a brother so this means it is a sister asking again m ghost as long as you are a man and you are alive and you are blood in your veins you will not be the same after hugging them [Music] [Music] oh if you have met for the first time even if you have met for the first time you i was just reading between the lines when i was looking at my wife i tell you to get started in ethiopia it means you don't like our food she fed my wife my wife also named charlotte and i was there too in hungary it was really weird but after a few years i preached to the believers about culture versus the world nature the world has its own culture we have our no please stop hugging brothers it is not good the bible says that a woman should not put on anything oh i mean across that is for a man does it mean that a woman cannot put on a man's jacket [Music] a man a brother a woman omokazee should not wear that which pertaining all right so in other words he's not saying husband wife or something or like me putting on my wife's car for something out of my head that which is like unto a madness a man or a woman [Music] yes yes because some of the legs are very very very ugly the way i am there is no hips coming out i could take a vibe i was a woman when a man was wearing a trouser in paris like that today women who think they are men and you know so really it's impossible for a woman to dress a trouser and she doesn't show the format of her body it actually i'll not use the what i was going to use in the middle there but i would say it attracts naturally attracts the eyes of a man he is a man of god his own heart before god [Music] and that's why women should dress clothes that cover their body you see so so you see sometimes we say as long as it is below the knee automatically and some they just dress up and then when they they sit there when i told that this cat comes that name okay no so you have a problem actually even away so i hope i've answered that if a sister wants to jog for health issues you are a christian when you are swimming you are a christian when you are joking you are a christian in the everywhere you are here how about if you vow to the girlfriend after believing the message what is the way forward i have to believe the message what is the word for what would i answer this i think don't hold anymore all right let us read um this one i'm about to finish i'm just closing up i have about five papers i think i should just finish them right quick mango how can one come to get a close connection with god because most of the youth try their best but in most cases things fail i personally i get challenges which i cannot be open to anyone so i'm kindly requesting for both advice and help [Music] okay now you get close to god through prayer through reading the word and if you need help or advice come come see me over here [Music] in many ways next to others you can um you know sing in church departments here there's a video department review my video this you know [Music] the what they're teaching about according to the world number two their life before they preach they don't leave [Music] character and conduct the prophet says one should marry one whom she or he can't live without now question what if she or he is an unbeliever but when all his or her conduct and all characteristics show that he or she can believe who [Music] have split up and their children and everything or he becomes a throne in your life another decision you make once and forever i understand that what marries one is the acceptance of a proposal for marriage [Music] under what circumstances does this proposal become null and void [Music] is it adultery if a lady has something like like six children from different men whereby she's not married of any of them okay with many men it's just like that woman who met jesus with the prostitute and she um she had she had had six five and then he was living with the sickness and jesus said that none of them is your husband yes [Music] is all right i have one more here it says the elect believers on their death foot go to the 16th dimension and the non-believers goes to the fifth dimension on the second resurrection there are those people that are separated who get salvation opportunity thereafter judgment before this when their faith is not yet decided which dimension are they the sixth or the fifth i mean so the brother is asking about that i don't know if all of you know dimensions fourth dimension in science [Music] the souls that are uh are sleeping this one is saying that they mentioned and the non-believers well the fifth dimension which is hell okay so he says that the unbelievers they go to the fifth dimension who have unto that when they on the on the white front judgment they don't go to the rapture but they die what would happen others remain here but they die still um and then after they were the millennia on the white throne judgment but here is one thing i want to correct why don't you never go to today but the bottom says that that life the eternal life that there's nobody going to get eternal life on the white front judge whatever [Music] and in in the but those souls that will receive grace whatever the meme is definitely on the white front judgment in general is because they had already received it this way right now now now now catch you when you are getting it someone is getting saved why do you want him and they are receiving christ crystal is that right it's true but they when they die because all those who believe in christ got one place in christopher remember these were virgins but nobody invaded they were in the same place for him and when the trumpet sounded the corner of the africa when they died and if anybody believes on the lord i i i do not exactly know if they were with with the others with the the others who were on the sixth dimension i don't exactly know if they were with the others who were waiting to get resurrection this is one that i want to look at more more carefully who shall be these kings of the earth bringing uh glory into this okay i don't understand this into this city okay can you read for me revelation 21 i really mean bible yeah okay and so who will be those kings and okay can you read that in english for me i think he's talking about the city 24. and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there now i believe that the bible says we the bride are the kings and the priests i believe the moment you believe christ and receive the holy ghost kid is a christian you you come into arroyo into royals you become a king and you become a priest and i believe it will be us in that new city and we will also have glory because it says which part is that and they shall walk okay they shall walk in the light okay of course we always sing the song we will walk in the light the beautiful light okay then he says uh which verse is that again this 20 24 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory into it that there in for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and i believe that all those people because there are those that are saved but not kings not in royalty not not not the bride well yeah [Music] okay there's another one here but all these questions that brother you've asked i need to go through them again when i'm not tired because at this youthful age it's when boys and girls are attracted to each other and they and they jump pitch it can come back in the future when one is over continuation of the first time for everything okay let me so we are done with all the questions we've gone through with most of them i see i have i am not the one who asked that question i would like you pastor to talk about forgiveness be biblically irrespective of what it is okay you're saying you're not the one who asked the question about forgiveness but you want to admit about forgiveness i do not know which aspect the brother brother can you explain on your question clarifying this question that's why i said i'll go in detail in need but um i just say that believers forgive us i don't think you can explain forgiveness i don't know some people have hearts that they can't forgive somebody even when someone asked for forgiveness on you but the scripture teaches us to say if someone has done something against your mother nature because they listen go to them gain their charity don't wait for them to come to you turning that yes maybe they don't know that they [Music] you are alone i'd like a young man with a good a good a good answer for to this to come
