see you guys are crazy we've missed you so much the devil is a liar I said the devil is amen amen praise the name of Allah let us go to the award in the book of second Timothy chapter four second Timothy chapter 4 we will read verse 5. amen Amina this is our main our first Main Service in the year and how many are feeling very happy to be in charge this evening it's wonderful myself I couldn't wait to get to church amen Amina the Lord is good so before before we get into the world I wanted to let you know that we are going to have a uh the ministers the brothers that we're going to have a committee meeting after the uh the organizing committee for the Youth meetings to discuss on on on on the arrangements but I would really like to ask anybody who would like to stay if you have some time and you you would like to stay and help us amen I mean we are reading verse 5 and then we shall sit uh Second Timothy chapter 4 verses 5. but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry is foreign foreign but one of them made it yesterday and as we were working together with him he had this question yeah and I wanted to discuss uh to talk about this to tonight because I've had discussion from a lot of young people foreign but they are from where you don't remember also okay but they're from Western Uganda neighbor in Western Uganda so they say the the they've been following our meetings online and they were blessed very much amen amen and so um there are many more people who listen to our services and we thank God for internet because then we can be able to get the word to more people praise the name of the Lord and so many young people have asked me these questions [Music] how do they know that they are called into the ministry or how do you know you have a Ministry how can you make proof of it so how can you be sure that this is what God called you today and so I was sharing what I'm going to share this evening with one of the younger brothers [Music] and after we concluded then at the end of it we we started talking about the holy spirit says if you want to you want angels to appearance talk about Jesus Christ talk about him and whenever you talk about him he shows up do you believe that and you know he was he began to tell me you know how he has desired in his heart to receive the Holy Spirit and you know he's been preaching for a little while and so um but I asked him I just ask him but do you have the Holy Spirit [Music] I felt bad in my heart because do you believe yourself God said yes what about if the devil came here and told you you are not safe he said no I said why he said because I have a revelation revealed to me that I'm saved Jesus died for me on the cross yes I believe I'm saying so I told him it's the same way with the Holy Spirit until you received the Revelation it is for you just like you receive a revelation the blood that Jesus said on the cross of Calvary and when you receive that Revelation you are not there but you believe it is you believe it is applied upon your life and it is the same way with the Holy Spirit foreign amen I I don't know what the neighbors thought and the other people but we just you know we were rejoicing in the middle yeah hallelujah amen because of you who don't believe it I believe it God still fills with the holy spirit let me tell you if you don't have the Holy Spirit you must receive him before the Rapture because if the Rapture comes and you don't have him you are going to stay in the tribulation praise the name of the Lord so this evening I'd like us to speak on the pattern for every true Ministry there is a pattern that God said that you will find in every true minister or Ministry in Romans chapter 12 verse let us first read there for us we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of members one over another having then gifts deferring according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that slows show us Mercy with cheerfulness foreign [Music] [Applause] you cannot just be an idea and in the same way the body of Christ must be a lively body it must be a living body and you know each of us we are members of that body we are parts of that body what part are you category do you know the part you are um when I stand on the pulpit and I preach to you I might be the mouth but I'm not I'm not everything what are you going to each of us is important each of you is important and there's no more important people foreign chicken days that original inactive but when you receive the holy ghosts that those dead Parts in you Allah and puts them into action and you become an active member of them Hallelujah man before you receive the Holy Ghost you are just a nominal church member I don't want us to be nominal church members I want us to be true members but I'm talking about the body of Christ but now how many people you know they find many times themselves doing things [Music] and they've always wanted to know is this my place you know you find yourself behind the pulpit and then you wonder is this your place you know maybe you're a mother is that your place maybe you are playing the piano is that your place maybe you go out to preach on the streets is that your place how can you be able to know for sure that that is your place how can the rest be able to know that is your place everybody must be able to know that is your place Jesus it's not Pastor telling brother buddy brother the ball come and preaching brother Billy Paul when you come to preach we will know whether you are you you are in the right position of ministry but how can we know there is a pattern one way we call that God has said how can you be able to know um they are preaching the truth the ministry there is the true Ministry how can you be able to know there must surely be a way we cannot just guess we go to this church and then when you find the addressing so nice and then you say oh they have good music we have a pattern to the name called a Bible pattern on how to know a true Ministry and here is what I want us to go through tonight praise the name of the Lord Paul founded the church at Ephesus [Music] about the middle of the first century and he says his manner of ministering set the pattern that all future Messengers were to Aspire to exam yet praise the name of the Lord Paul was this was the one who set the pattern that's all very much how many America seven Messengers to seven Church churches in every church was the first message and that pattern was supposed to be followed by all the other ministers or Messengers after him [Music] it must follow the first pattern now here he says and actually he sets the pattern for every true minister of God take it away every true Minister follows that same pattern though he would not attain to such Heights in the prophetic realm as did Paul what there is and this is what every true minister this is what they must have he says first of all Paul was absolutely true to the world never deviated from it no matter what the cause you want to know whether you were you were called to be a preacher praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I don't know whether my ears have a problem but this is loud it's just loud but you know you need to but someone help him to hear until you you know it is very good it's just loud I wanted to be a bit calm not reduced but come praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah first of all ah Paul was absolutely true to the world [Music] deviated from it no matter what the cost foreign [Music] foreign as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that which you have received let him be a cast now today you can see that there are many people who are preaching another gospels and even in this message you find people who claim to believe the message but when they have other Revelations God gave only one man the authority to interpret the word because God is his own Divine interpreter God interprets his own word and what does he do sends prophets and when a prophet comes a prophet comes with thus saith the Lord the prophet is interpretation of the world it is not his idea it is the true word of God when God sends a preacher praise the name of the Lord hallelujah are you following me this evening really the sound of man is really doing me bad tonight here the word ichigambo I've had many people try to debate [Music] what the prophet said and they have their own opinions they try to take the Bible you know and they compare it to the message and they said the Bible and the message did you hear what I said they said the Bible and a message they are lacking Revelations the Bible and the message is the same thing Bible is how many believe that when Paul was giving his message did he have a Bible did he have a Bible yeah all right now I have you there you are saying well I can say he had the Bible of those days because those were the books of the Old Testament it was present at the time many many times but now when he was preaching what he was preaching what was it charity what was it charity come on shout on top of your voice Hallelujah it was the message what he was preaching was the mercy let me ask you was the message that he was preaching different from the Bible no not at all but yet in the Bible which he had at that time it was saying that man must be circumcised and Paul came with the message and he said whoever you are circumcised or not [Music] it does not matter in Christ it doesn't matter so can you now compare the Bible and the message of Paul okay but people in that day did not believe it because it seemed as if Paul's message was contradicting with the Bible times message can never contradict with the Bible foreign [Applause] can we say it's a message of a man dreams because it was not the message it was the word of God for our day and the pattern of it of that of a true Minister the first thing he says he will be absolutely true to the word chances so what is the word the word comes to the prophet in your generation the way he interprets it for you in your generation you must say stay true to that when you deviate away that that is not a true Ministry and when Paul received the message and now today we have people foreign God bless you it's not wrong it doesn't matter where we play since I can play it at home when we are driving even in the church what is wrong with that nothing wrong with that at all but where someone says teachers should not preach they should sit down and then the tape only should preach now we know they are deviating away from the true word of God we know that they are not true ministers Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord but when Peter was come and to Antioch I withstood him to he to the face because he was to be blamed but when I saw that they walked not operately according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before them all without being a Jew give yourself the demand of Gentiles and not as do the Jews why do you compare these Gentiles also to live as Jews yeah I want you to follow me here closely here is a man called Paul and Paul was a preacher but Paul was the junior he came after all the disciples Peter was like the pastor of the first church and Peter had preached and baptized many and Peter had moved with Jesus for many days and then Paul came on the scene and his ministry started and here is what he's saying I stood when Peter was come to Antioch baited away I withstood him to the face because he was to be blameda and Soviet are you hearing that Paul disagreed with Peter Paulo no Paul disagreed with Peter since Paul disagreed and when he disagreed he did not keep quiet he will not say I will not speak because how will the others how will the pastors when he tells me to preach and then I talk I touched this part I will not touch that part because I may be annoyed if you are a god called the preacher if you have a true Ministry you will not preach to please anybody appease let me tell you if God called you to preach foreign [Applause] If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord hallelujah Paul was able to establish that what he was speaking was not his thoughts what he was speaking was the word of God you know I've seen many people that brother Branham can interpret for them some things but some things they don't need brother banam to interpretation I told you this is a foundational message I want you to listen to me very much and I know what I'm talking about I went to Nigeria one day in Nigeria and I met a pastor his church is a crowded tens of thousands yes [Music] and so when I I arrived there when I took Ayo you know I noticed that the sudden he believes the message apparently he believed so when I arrived there I noticed that I'm in the church sisters were using Vape on their heads all of them and then sisters would come and they would be given a microphone in the name of prophesy so they would prophesy like for 30 minutes you don't know what it is like what like what here does blessing water and the people use it what to do where the pain is so I sat with him because I have started the message listen friend some of us came from denominations and when we came we were convinced that brother banam was the prophet of Malachi 4. we were convinced he was the prophet who would reveal whose message we were convinced that the mystery of God would be finished we were convinced that his message amen because of his message because it is worth living foreign when I'm preaching to you here I quote for you from the message here is what the prophet says why because what he said is the word of the Lord for this hour is the revelation of God of the word of God because the word of God comes to a prophet it doesn't come to an apostle to a preacher to a pastor comes to a prophet in our generation and we believe we have a prophet in Our Generations if I have a true Ministry myself through to the interpretation of that word sent to Our Generation by a prophet hallelujah amen you are Faith must not be in my Ministry please they're following a man's Ministry you know even the churches are called after the names of the pastors let us with me and my wife in my chest we must understand that this message is no longer after personalities that's why the bride is interested in that's why a true God called Pastor um messenger of your death said about every matter he preaches to you um and you know I I was I look like a very small man in the presence of this past of this huge assembly thousand people and I sat there and we started talking and I asked him I said I have a question for you also he said you can go on I said tell me where do you get this idea of sisters using a veil because yet because I'm another service explains the substance on the issue of the hair and it says a woman should not cut her hair unbeliever sisters you know you should not cut your hair you know you have another right vowel sisters did you know that if you say Amen which one is here and that is his interpretation and every woman among all those tens of thousands that each of them had available and then on other things he says some he needs others he doesn't matter every minute and he claims to believe this message right now he disclaimed the message yet he looked when you hear his preaching it was so powerful but now he's saying I'm ashamed of what I used to say hey ashamed of the message he had his own Revelations for me I appreciate the past as God gives us a pastor who will stay in the message of the hour um one of the qualities is you will absolutely be true to the world no matter what the cause even if you feel the messenger was wrong you understand it better you understand it better remember you are not a messenger who got Vindicated there is one Vindicated messenger in a generation is the interpretation of the world is the true word of God church that is they have just shown themselves notice that Paul was unorganized he was unorganized unorganized but it means he was not having an organization he was Spirit laid as when God moved upon Moses to lead Israel out of Egypt Jerusalem's Council never sent Paul out is no they didn't have any power or jurisdiction over him telling you the quietness of a true Ministry praise the name of the Lord one of them we are still on one of them actually the first one the first one so he will be true to the world that Paul was not under any organization a true Minister will not be led by an organization a true minister is [Applause] a true Minister when God moves he moves that's why in the message every church is independent yeah we are led by God by the word we are not led by organizations hallelujah amen that's why the message we don't believe in a pastor being a pastor of many churches and that's a wrong Spirit that's why we notice that eating first was the seed or the deed of the Nicolaitans they put people under bondage and to ever take away the men Leading Men has always wanted a ruler and in the denominations you find the churches this one is the headquarter of days of the voice of the voice so now we will go and start branches the days of the voice of the voice Ginger there is a denomination you don't even care whether there is another church even if it's a message for us we are planting here you put days of the voice and in all those branches Chicago and let me tell you that's the truth every pasta that is foreign and that's how you know a true Ministry Hallelujah Amina Paul was not of men but of God this isn't a message Hallelujah that's the first pattern so there is much I can preach about it but for the interest of time let me go to the seconds so the first one is the minister will absolutely be true to the world what is the word the reviewed word of the house thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word no the word the true Minister um you are not going to come and and play games for the people you are not going to be an inspirational speaker [Music] inspirational speakers yes but that's one of them who else yes that's another one what about in Uganda I don't know anyone in Uganda you're speaking not on the microphone brother don't bring us trouble listen these many of these are inspirational speakers a true ministry will be in the power of the spirit demonstrating the spoken and written word that's why even that preacher so whatever nobody saw you oh Hallelujah when he begins to preach let me tell you at any preacher talk about any preacher if it's called of God rather if he's anointed of God he will not preach to make people love him he will not preach to make brothers he will not preach to make you just be happy but when he preaches he will have one purpose one [Applause] foreign foreign Hallelujah if if Brother Sam comes preach to us and he comes here he's not going to begin you know you know the Begins the family here you know laughing around looking down everybody second time because we have realized foreign foreign are you getting what I'm saying my name is especially you know most of these things are there but so much [Music] he will not preach you to sleep he will not preach you to sleep he will preach in the demonstration [Music] of the Holy Spirit the world comes like a fire the word comes like a fire burn out all the sins out of your life a true Minister when you when you are sitting there in the church is preaching will make you uncomfortable [Applause] now we shall know as a true Ministry but where you go again and you feel so comfortable even when you were a sinner then you should run for your life you know but the Bible says we are the thought of the earth if the sword loses itself where is God that that's going to be we are not the sugar of the earth we are the salt so it is not sweet salt only tests no no amenities but when you go to a church and you come to church [Applause] it means that Minister will help you Hallelujah and and Paul said and I be and I Brethren when I come to you I did not come with Excellence of speech of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for determined not to know anything among you know Jesus Christ but he's preaching Community speaking he says it was in demonstration of the spirit and Power [Music] is in demonstration Hallelujah it doesn't matter whether you preach for one day or 20 20 years there will be the demonstration of the spirit of God and the power of God I remember there is one day in Ethiopia we asked by the mortgage to preach for the first time it was about the second or third time and as he was preaching he had his sister and his sister and to them foreign foreign [Music] what is that is the power and demonstration of the spirit is sick it's not just going in the church and then you see it and the word is preached and and then you just hear others are even on WhatsApp you know you're WhatsApp what's up what's the demonstration of the spirit wow foreign you can't try to use your WhatsApp the power of God will shake it let me tell you you come you go it might not be discharged might be in a fellowship as long as the message is being preached in power and demonstrations his name is anointed who was a true Minister and he was speaking on the pulpit yeah he said tell me brother in you is this what you have sold he said yes he said all right you have not lied to me immediately his wife came here was the power of God it's not the place the anointed under the power and demonstration of the Holy ghosts praise the name of the Lord and at that moment the sister also came here and at that moment she died that's not that God is alive by the way if what we are preaching is the truth there must be demonstrations there should be Miracles if any Ministry I don't care it might be this one or anyone oh where is a true Ministry we must have that part also buddy demonstration and power of the Holy ghosts if it does not have it it is a false Ministry foreign let us leave that for the denominations and the denominations where we came from just preaching um show Faith grown in the spirit seeing the more you build yourself where were you let the word come through you okay don't throw it away and be a conductor let the Holy Ghost you know when you're looking at the preacher with faith close your eyes that's not right and while Paul was preaching as he was preaching foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] because in the message we yield to the Holy Spirit and then when he comes the pressure begins to preach in the denominations today our reading is he will go and see it the priest will also come on so today oh we are talking about the power Above the Rest and you can even hear something falling down that's not true even if it's a coin um because there is silence the place is so dead okay it gives you life that's why we should always stay under the word by the way and there's there's another story which I wanted to say but I think I should skip that you know the one of when Paul was preaching and then he preached for so long and then a man Fellowship is and they brought this younger man and Paul I think his name was he went into dozing yes when the preaching was going on and he fell off he was on the window he fell off yeah [Applause] what happened there we need to blush shoulders with your friends out in the world but if you brush shoulders with the anointed ones from the house of God hallelujah amen their life will come in here you go there in your friends because you're always [Music] football playing football is not a scene or no but there are many things associated with it the younger people should try to run away from the address in the shorts back in November said that is the woman is in a clause then the other thing they go there with these young people some of them are drunk others [Applause] I don't know how they call those people you know there is one who keeps the god that is the one which does in the number what number this Defender so man I don't know who you're going to be there but the one you are always going to be with his life slowly but it doesn't happen immediately slowly his life what happened she was not football but the issue was who were you playing with which company were you keeping that's why many of us decided to run away from that kind of life we did not we decided to leave the going to uh yes you know does it what are they called in English that's why I believe I want to go to cinema don't go to betting houses we don't go to bars we don't go to bars we don't we don't go to football together we don't want to go yeah you are getting the spirit of the world and you're pretending that you're a believer hallelujah amen and then all of a sudden they will tell you let us go our Defenders even there's a brother who told me I think it was brother even whoever he used to love football just to go and watch with his friends and he realized he was born dude foreign foreign but Apostle Paul said everything is not that that everything is lawful everything is lawful but not everything is expedient everything is okay but everything is not a must for me to do it take it there's someone who asked me said pastor is it is it a sin to drink alcohol because even the Bible where it says they should not drink much wine and then portal Timothy you can take a little for your stomach so is it okay many things are not a sin maybe many things we don't do them I mean to be injected to be cooler because the spirit of God has led us that way but I can tell you drunkards have their part in Hell Fire um again I can drink but I'm not a bit drunk you're playing with a snack sadly he had the evident fruit of his god-given ministry that's the third thing to prove a true Ministry first thing true to the word of God demonstration of the spoken word and the written ones not might be must be taken Dua we should always expect miracles whenever we come to church sister if you have a problem whenever you come to church expect a miracles Hallelujah and then sadly there will be the evident fruit of his ministry if you are going to preach on the road and you are saying telling us that God has called you to preach but you preached there for two years but not even a cockroach and see whether God called if I say that God sent me tonight and there is just two people a year after year after year then I should really check and see whether God called that's why I Believe by the end of this year this place will not be able to carry US foreign foreign in a hallelujah amen let us seeing this joy that I have the devil never gave it to me I'd like you to really enjoyed me and let us sing this song after we close we shall go to the meeting as I promised you but you know this joy that I have that they will never give it to me oh this joy that I have the devil never gave it to me oh this joy that High [Music] never gave it to me oh the devil never gave it the devil can't take it away [Music] oh the devil never gave it to me this joke that I have who the musicians come on now we're here this show that I have oh the devil never gave it to me will that devil never give it the
