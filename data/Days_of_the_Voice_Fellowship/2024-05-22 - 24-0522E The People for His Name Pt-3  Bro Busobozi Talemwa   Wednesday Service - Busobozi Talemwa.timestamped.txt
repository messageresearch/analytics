[33:24] just barely read the opening scripture
[33:31] and we did not go into the
[33:34] message how many appreciate the presence
[33:36] of God on
[33:38] Sunday it was just
[33:40] wonderful I just pray that God gives us
[33:42] more of
[33:44] that and those who missed the service
[33:47] you really missed a
[33:49] lot such moments you cannot manufacture
[33:54] it it just comes from from the
[33:56] supernatural
[33:58] [Music]
[34:00] so we are going to go to the Book of
[34:04] Exodus uh brother Dixon you still have
[34:07] some work to do Exodus chapter 3: 1
[34:12] to uh to9
[34:31] [Music]
[34:35] okay so we are reading from vers three
[34:38] sorry vers 1 to vers 9 this is the same
[34:43] portion we read on
[34:45] Sunday we shall just rehearse
[34:48] it and then we see what the Lord will
[34:51] speak to
[34:53] us amen now Moses kept the flock of Je
[34:57] th his father in-law the priest of
[35:01] Midian and he led the
[35:03] flock to the back side of the desert and
[35:06] came to the Mountain of God even
[35:20] Tob and the angel of the Lord appeared
[35:23] unto him in a flame of fire out of the
[35:25] midst of a bush and he looked and behold
[35:28] the bush burned with fire and the Bush
[35:31] was not
[35:33] [Music]
[35:43] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[35:46] aside and see this great sight why the
[35:49] bush is not burned
[36:02] and when the Lord saw that he turned
[36:03] aside to seea God called unto him out of
[36:06] the midst of the Bush and said Moses
[36:10] Moses and he said here am
[36:22] I draw not nther put off thy shoes from
[36:26] off thy feet for the place where on thou
[36:29] standest is Holy
[36:38] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[36:41] thy father the god of Abraham the god of
[36:43] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[36:46] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[36:49] God
[37:01] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[37:04] Affliction of my people which are in
[37:07] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[37:10] of their task Masters for I know their
[37:12] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[37:15] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[37:17] and to bring them out of the that land
[37:19] unto a good land and a and a large and
[37:22] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[37:25] and unto the place of the Canaanites to
[37:26] the heit the hammerites and the
[37:28] perizzites and the hites and the jeites
[38:09] now there Behold The Cry of the children
[38:11] of Israel is come unto me and I have
[38:14] also seen the oppression where with the
[38:17] Egyptians oppress them
[38:28] [Music]
[38:31] and he said lastly we read the verse 10
[38:33] as well come now and I will send thee
[38:35] unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[38:37] forth my people the children of Israel
[38:41] out of
[38:50] Egypt amen you may be seated
[38:59] praise the
[39:04] lord we have been dealing with a subject
[39:07] on the uh people for his
[39:12] name and we were we were talking about
[39:16] the
[39:17] battle the battle being the Lord
[39:22] is
[39:24] amen I think it was a very good service
[39:27] on
[39:28] Su because God show that the battle is
[39:32] his it's not
[39:35] ours you know the Bible speaks of um
[39:40] when they were dedicating the world the
[39:41] temple the the Temple of
[39:45] Solomon it says the presence of God came
[39:50] down and it was so
[39:52] heavy that the ministers could not be
[39:54] able to minister
[39:57] to me I I feel that if were we were in
[39:59] such a
[40:02] presence it is much better than spending
[40:05] hour was
[40:08] teaching uh because on
[40:11] Sunday I mean I just read the opening
[40:13] scripture
[40:15] only and every from after I read opening
[40:19] scripture I notice the ho Spirit was
[40:21] reading me
[40:24] differently I was not able to get to my
[40:26] notes and read other verses and quotes
[40:28] and
[40:30] scriptures and so sometimes you know the
[40:33] prophet told us that the the a
[40:37] gift is a man taking himself out of the
[40:42] way and then letting God use
[40:46] it because you cannot do it on your
[40:50] own whether you are a
[40:52] Pianist or guitarist drum
[40:57] you know or a preacher or a singer if
[41:01] you cannot say well I know what I'm
[41:03] going to
[41:04] do and then whenever you are going to
[41:06] say I know I know I'm going to do it
[41:07] very
[41:09] well that the day you will fail
[41:12] terribly even if you knew how to sing
[41:15] and then you say let me I know all the
[41:17] verses i w even read
[41:21] anywh I'm just going to go and enter the
[41:23] spirit and sing
[41:25] it that's the day you will fail
[41:28] terribly the focus will not
[41:31] work the key will be different than the
[41:34] one you
[41:35] singing you struggle your eyes will go
[41:40] red until you just no let me let me
[41:44] quit so you see but if you have a gift
[41:46] of
[41:47] God you have to learn letting
[41:53] go and allowing God to use it operate
[41:58] do not try to operate it
[42:00] yourself and and so I noticed even with
[42:04] preaching it is the
[42:05] same if had come up and said well I have
[42:08] this notes I must preach it
[42:11] Tom iay upon God I
[42:14] started but you see when I step here or
[42:18] when any preacher steps
[42:19] here we don't come to show
[42:22] off we don't come to show what we
[42:25] know we don't come to to demonstrate
[42:29] something you know no matter how long a
[42:32] preacher will
[42:34] preach I mean no matter how long he has
[42:36] been
[42:38] preaching you if you're truly having a
[42:41] gift of
[42:42] God you can never get
[42:45] used to standing before the children of
[42:49] God and preaching to them it's always a
[42:53] nervous experience
[42:57] you don't know how it will come out
[42:59] because you see you're not relying on
[43:00] your
[43:01] own you relying on on on something
[43:04] Divine something
[43:06] superal isn't it so lovely for you to
[43:08] come to church and hear from
[43:12] God you know even you who just comes and
[43:15] maybe sit down and hear the
[43:18] word you need to train
[43:21] yourself hearing from
[43:25] God if you just come and say today I'm
[43:27] just lazy I'm
[43:30] tired let him preach to others
[43:33] today you'll get nothing out of
[43:35] this but when you come to the
[43:38] service even if no matter how you're
[43:40] feeling you know you just yeld yourself
[43:44] and say I don't know what he's going to
[43:46] speak to
[43:47] you but I want to open my heart and I
[43:50] want to hear what the spirit has for
[43:53] me let me tell you that day you will
[43:55] have a real good service
[43:58] praise the Lord and so uh you know how
[44:02] everything
[44:03] went how everything
[44:06] went um brother Henry was telling
[44:10] me uh he also did not I mean we did not
[44:14] plan that you now come and
[44:19] song it was just the whole spirit that
[44:21] was doing that and then even the songs
[44:24] he was
[44:25] singing you know he would leave start
[44:27] sing another one the words spoke you
[44:30] know everything was just
[44:33] Supernatural friends I think we should
[44:35] be more sensitive to the holy leadership
[44:37] of the Holy
[44:39] Spirit you know the word may be so
[44:42] nice that the Holy Spirit nudges you to
[44:44] stand up and cheer
[44:49] it shout and enjoy the word and and you
[44:53] like no how will they see me you are not
[44:56] yielding yourself
[44:58] we should be a Congregation of
[45:01] people that learn to yield
[45:04] ourselves many of us sometimes come to
[45:06] church weak and tired and weary and
[45:11] sick by the end of the message we are
[45:13] all happy and rejoicing and
[45:16] he so how many have come expecting
[45:20] tonight amen may the Lord speak to us I
[45:22] know some who have traveled from far in
[45:25] G you know it's it's wonderful I pray
[45:28] that God will be able to minister to
[45:31] us so today I might be a little longer
[45:34] than
[45:37] usual always end the service at
[45:41] 7 may go about 30 minutes
[45:44] more so just prepare your mind for
[45:47] that so now I'm I'm looking at um the
[45:50] people for his
[45:54] name you see the the the Jews left
[45:58] Egypt they went into the Wilderness they
[46:01] crossed the Red
[46:03] Sea and now when they had crossed
[46:07] Jordan that's when the real battle
[46:11] started you think that they were
[46:13] fighting battles
[46:16] before but really the real battle
[46:18] started when they had crossed
[46:22] Jordan and that is how it is with our
[46:24] Christian Life
[46:28] the Christian Life is a
[46:31] battle it is something that you you have
[46:33] to be willing to
[46:36] fight it is not Prophet says it's not a
[46:39] Bed of
[46:42] Roses there are many scriptures written
[46:45] here many of which we
[46:48] know it is it is easy to read them but
[46:53] it is hard to leave
[46:55] them because is a battle you have to
[46:59] fight every inch of
[47:01] ground so I want us I wanted us on
[47:05] Sunday I hope that tonight we'll be able
[47:06] to do that I wanted us to take Israel as
[47:10] a
[47:12] nation and see how it types
[47:18] us yes so God always works and deals
[47:22] with Jews and Gentiles separately
[47:29] he deals with Jews as a
[47:31] nation he deals with Gentiles as a
[47:35] people now Israel is the church
[47:38] natural we the Gentiles were the church
[47:43] spiritual now whatever they they as a
[47:46] nation went through we go through as
[47:52] individuals so in order to call the
[47:54] children of Israel out of bondage
[47:58] God did a few
[48:00] things number one he sent a
[48:04] prophet with a message number two it was
[48:08] a message accompanied with
[48:13] signs praise the name of the Lord do I
[48:16] have the the controller for this yeah
[48:23] one brother Dixon or somebody can you
[48:25] come up
[48:27] excuse me
[48:28] [Music]
[48:49] please okay sorry it was just making my
[48:51] lips so dry that I can't
[48:55] talk okay
[48:58] you know he uh he sent a prophet with a
[49:00] message and it was a message accompanied
[49:02] with
[49:04] [Music]
[49:08] signs I want you to follow this
[49:12] Clos but the
[49:14] signs followed the
[49:19] message not the message followed the
[49:23] sign if you understand that say Amen
[49:27] some did not understand did you get
[49:29] it we see here that God speaks to
[49:33] Moses when God when God had the people
[49:37] crying they cry of course on Sunday I
[49:39] went through the whole history on how
[49:41] they went and ended up in
[49:46] Egypt so I want to go back into that I
[49:49] want us to see how when God calls
[49:53] Moses and he tells him Moses I am now
[49:55] going to send you to
[49:58] Egypt because I have heard the Cry of my
[50:02] people and have come down to deliver
[50:05] them and I'm going to send you down
[50:07] there to go and deliver them now I want
[50:11] I want you to ask yourself a
[50:13] question wasn't God able to deliver them
[50:15] without
[50:18] Moses the question is did he have the
[50:20] power to do
[50:22] it he could do
[50:24] anything because God indeed do
[50:28] anything but God did not do it without
[50:33] Moses God cannot do it without a Moses
[50:37] without a
[50:40] prophet because whenever God is dealing
[50:42] with his
[50:44] people he expects his people to trust
[50:47] him the way if you go through the whole
[50:49] Bible from Genesis to
[50:51] Revelation that is how God
[50:54] works God has never worked without
[50:58] man as long as it is a business to
[51:01] redeem or save
[51:04] man God has always used
[51:07] man to to to to work with
[51:10] man man because you see God knows it is
[51:14] difficult for man to believe in in
[51:16] fellow
[51:19] man but it is only those with the seed
[51:21] of God in their
[51:24] heart that will see a man before them
[51:26] and they will not see a man but they
[51:28] will see God speaking to
[51:34] them you remember even in the New
[51:37] Testament you know this
[51:40] man I think it was
[51:43] Lazarus when Lazarus
[51:45] died and uh he he went to heaven he
[51:50] wanted
[51:51] God to send
[51:54] him because he was talking to at least
[51:57] let me
[51:59] go when they see a man from
[52:03] the just jumping like
[52:05] that I am your brother from the day and
[52:09] I've come to tell you hell is
[52:11] real I am right now burning
[52:14] in he thought they will
[52:18] believe but what did Abraham tell
[52:21] Abraham said down on
[52:24] Earth there are preachers
[52:27] if your people hear
[52:29] them they will not come where you are so
[52:32] everyone has an
[52:35] opportunity God gives everyone an equal
[52:38] opportunity to hear the message and
[52:40] believe it or to hear it and reject
[52:44] it and God will judge each
[52:47] one according to whether they rejected
[52:49] the word or they received the
[52:52] word but you see you cannot accept the
[52:55] word
[52:57] go without accepting the
[52:59] messenger are you following me Church
[53:02] you have to accept the
[53:03] messenger in order to accept the
[53:07] word follow me closely here we see that
[53:10] God now sends
[53:11] Moses and he tells him go I'm going to
[53:15] send you to my
[53:16] people and I want you to serve them I
[53:20] want you to bring them out of that land
[53:23] and I I want you to bring them to a land
[53:25] flowing with milk and
[53:28] honey so the Lord willing we shall be
[53:31] able to talk about the land and the
[53:32] battles of the
[53:35] land but for now let us talk about okay
[53:37] that's becoming better now so let us now
[53:40] talk a little bit about how uh they were
[53:43] able to come out of
[53:46] Egypt okay all right so now I want you
[53:49] to go to Exodus chapter 7:
[53:54] 3 praise the name of the Lord
[54:00] vers three says and I will and I will
[54:02] harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply my
[54:04] signs and my wonders in the land of
[54:16] Egypt but Pharaoh shall not hecken unto
[54:18] you that I may lay my hand upon Egypt
[54:21] and bring forth my my armies
[54:32] and my people the children of Israel out
[54:34] of the land of Egypt by great judgments
[54:36] and the Egyptians shall know that I am
[54:38] the Lord when I stretch forth my hand
[54:40] upon Egypt and bring out the children of
[54:42] Israel from among
[54:50] them praise the name of the Lord
[54:53] hallelujah amen I want you to see
[54:55] something here
[54:57] God has
[54:59] armies God is a god of
[55:01] love but also God is a god of
[55:05] war and he has armies but his armies are
[55:10] invisible but before he releases his
[55:14] armies he releases his
[55:17] man oh you're not hearing me today are
[55:19] you hearing me well if you're hearing me
[55:22] say Amen before he releases his armies
[55:26] he releases his
[55:28] man and we see that before he released
[55:30] his
[55:32] armies he released his man who was the
[55:34] commander of his
[55:37] armies and his man was
[55:40] Moses sent from
[55:42] God God every time everywhere every
[55:46] day he sends a man when you fa to see
[55:50] the man God will not fight your
[55:53] battle but when you receive the man
[55:57] that God sends to
[55:58] you then you remember that man will be
[56:00] the one that will command the armies of
[56:06] God so now God wanted so much let me
[56:11] tell you when you talk about fighting
[56:13] the Battle of
[56:14] faith it
[56:16] is not us fighting it is God fighting in
[56:20] us so here he made sure he is sending a
[56:24] commander
[56:26] to be able to
[56:28] fight imagine can you really choose a
[56:31] commander when you are not ready to
[56:36] fight if you have a war
[56:39] captain or or a commander of a battle
[56:43] you are expecting and you have guns and
[56:46] weapons and you expect that there is
[56:48] going to be
[56:50] a now listen this is the amazing part
[56:54] God now says
[56:56] I will
[56:57] harden Pharaoh's
[57:00] heart and I will multiply my signs and
[57:03] my wonders in the land of
[57:07] Egypt why did God even want to harden
[57:10] Pharaoh's
[57:12] heart because God wanted to show his
[57:16] power sometimes you fight
[57:19] things for a long time and they don't
[57:22] leave you they don't go away from
[57:24] you but let me tell you the reason
[57:27] is some of those things it is God who
[57:30] permits them or allows them to
[57:34] happen and whatever if it is God who has
[57:37] permitted it to
[57:39] happen he is waiting or fixing or
[57:42] wanting to multiply his signs and his
[57:49] wonders there will not be signs and
[57:51] wonders if there are no problems
[57:56] you remember the child who was
[57:58] blind and they came to Jesus and said
[58:01] why was he this
[58:04] way is it him who sinned is it his
[58:08] mother who sined is it his father who
[58:10] sinned he say none of them sin but the
[58:14] power of God must be made
[58:16] manifest sometimes God allows problems
[58:18] to
[58:19] come in your life in my family in your
[58:22] family you know because he wants to show
[58:25] forth
[58:27] his signs and his
[58:29] wonders in the land of Egypt when you
[58:33] are still in your
[58:34] problem he wants to show his signs and
[58:38] wonders in the land of your
[58:42] problems Hallelujah so now Pharaoh the
[58:45] Bible says he will harden Pharaoh's
[58:49] heart and he says Pharaoh shall not
[58:51] hecken to
[58:53] you sometimes you know you cast out
[58:55] devils
[58:56] I cast you in the name of Jesus and you
[58:59] remain sick I cast
[59:02] command and the devil doesn't hear don't
[59:05] you worry the battle is not
[59:07] yours the battle is not yours to fight
[59:11] if the devil doesn't go it means god is
[59:14] fixing oh
[59:16] Hallelujah he's fixing to do signs and
[59:20] wonders he says Pharaoh shall not hecken
[59:23] unto
[59:24] you the devil shall not hecken unto
[59:27] you that I may lay my hand upon
[59:32] him that I may lay my hand upon
[59:36] Egypt Hallelujah hallelu and bring forth
[59:40] my
[59:41] armies you see what brings the armies of
[59:44] God that the devil doesn't listen to
[59:47] you so that the armies of God can
[59:51] come the armies of God are
[59:55] invisible why do we call him the Lord of
[59:58] hosts host he has an army he's the Lord
[1:00:03] of hosts he has an army which cannot be
[1:00:07] seen with eyes the Bible says we War not
[1:00:10] against flesh and
[1:00:12] blood but we war against
[1:00:15] principalities we war against pow we war
[1:00:18] against spiritual darkness in high
[1:00:21] places our enemy is not
[1:00:24] physical the fight of faith is not
[1:00:27] against brothers and
[1:00:29] sisters it is against demons and spirits
[1:00:32] we can't
[1:00:33] see but you know the devil doesn't
[1:00:35] listen to us so that God can release his
[1:00:41] armies hallelujah amen and he says and
[1:00:44] my people the children of Israel you
[1:00:45] know they will you know out be out of
[1:00:47] the of the land of Egypt by great
[1:00:54] judgments God will have to bring great
[1:00:58] judgments upon the Devil upon the powers
[1:01:01] of Darkness upon the
[1:01:03] principalities upon the sicknesses upon
[1:01:06] the troubles and The Temptations God
[1:01:08] will have to show his
[1:01:11] power and the Egyptians shall
[1:01:14] know hallelujah amen and the Egyptians
[1:01:17] shall know that I am the
[1:01:20] Lord L O R Lord
[1:01:30] Hallelujah when I stretch forth my hand
[1:01:32] upon
[1:01:34] Egypt and bring out the children of
[1:01:36] Israel from among
[1:01:38] them now these were children of
[1:01:41] Israel and blood of bus and
[1:01:44] gods the same thing that applies to them
[1:01:47] applies to us
[1:01:50] spiritually if God Did It for Israel as
[1:01:52] a
[1:01:54] nation God does it for us as
[1:01:58] individuals you know the Journey of
[1:02:00] Christianity is not
[1:02:02] easy but don't worry God who is our
[1:02:06] savior he's also the
[1:02:09] enforcer of every promise of
[1:02:12] God we are not the ones who make it come
[1:02:14] to
[1:02:15] pass it is God who enforces every
[1:02:18] promise of his
[1:02:21] word hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[1:02:24] when the enemy comes in like a FL his
[1:02:27] Spirit his
[1:02:29] armies always fights for us they lift up
[1:02:33] a
[1:02:34] standard against the
[1:02:36] enemy Hallelujah let us continue on to
[1:02:39] verse
[1:02:40] eight and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[1:02:43] unto Aaron
[1:02:45] saying when
[1:02:47] Pharaoh shall speak unto
[1:02:49] you saying show a miracle for you
[1:02:57] then Thou shalt say unto
[1:02:59] Aon take thy Road of
[1:03:04] warfare it has never been the strong
[1:03:07] that win the
[1:03:09] war always has been the good War captain
[1:03:13] that is a very good
[1:03:19] strategist always you you you go and
[1:03:22] study the art of Modern Warfare or or
[1:03:24] Ancient Warfare what
[1:03:29] it has always been the one who was who
[1:03:32] was always having the upper hand was the
[1:03:33] one who knew how to
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:39] strategize he had to sit usually they
[1:03:42] walk up they have to sit down on a
[1:03:46] board and they
[1:03:48] draw how the they actually preempt how
[1:03:51] the war will
[1:03:53] be they write on a board and show you
[1:03:57] know they they have things like um you
[1:04:00] know they have these things like chess
[1:04:02] they have like something like a chess
[1:04:04] board and and then they will they will
[1:04:07] tell you now our enemies are going to
[1:04:08] come here they will come from here and
[1:04:12] they will come here
[1:04:14] but they have advantage on us
[1:04:18] now because we may be on Higher Ground
[1:04:21] here and we are in a valley but here is
[1:04:25] what we are going
[1:04:26] we are going to send
[1:04:28] spies so that we know their
[1:04:31] position and then we shall send our
[1:04:35] Calvary these ones going with
[1:04:38] horses and we shall keep them be right
[1:04:41] slightly behind
[1:04:43] them and they will not even know that we
[1:04:45] have our army behind
[1:04:48] them and then we shall come as a small
[1:04:52] army and then when they see us
[1:04:56] they will send all their armies to
[1:04:59] the thinking they're going to consume us
[1:05:03] but why they think they're
[1:05:05] finishing then we shall send all the
[1:05:07] other
[1:05:09] Battalion and we shall finish them in
[1:05:11] the coming from a higher ground that is
[1:05:15] now a good
[1:05:17] strategist he knows how to fight so it
[1:05:21] is because of the
[1:05:22] captain that the war will be won
[1:05:26] it is not because of how good the
[1:05:27] soldiers
[1:05:29] are it is because of how good the
[1:05:31] captain
[1:05:33] is hallelujah now listen to me Church
[1:05:37] our war Captain is Jesus Christ
[1:05:40] Hallelujah he has already made the whole
[1:05:44] strategy before we even came in the
[1:05:48] battlefield he has already drawn the
[1:05:50] whole strategy of
[1:05:52] war and he knows how everything is going
[1:05:55] to
[1:05:57] he knows where your enem is going to
[1:05:59] come
[1:05:59] from he knows how your enem is planning
[1:06:02] to
[1:06:03] fight how did he know that because he
[1:06:06] came as a
[1:06:07] spy he himself came as a spy he came in
[1:06:12] the battlefield and he fought this enemy
[1:06:15] and he knows this enemy so

[1:10:42] roads and you know trying to show that
[1:10:44] they have magic of
[1:10:46] power you know and trying to
[1:10:49] enchant yes yes it must have been that
[1:10:51] way you know trying to you know to call
[1:10:55] all the the Demons of
[1:10:59] Egypt all the powers of Egypt it's not
[1:11:02] the powers people tribes have
[1:11:06] powers you know cultures have
[1:11:11] powers that for
[1:11:13] us we have a lot of
[1:11:16] spirits and that in our culture they say
[1:11:20] you know you you you have a a
[1:11:22] priest upon whom the spirit
[1:11:25] of all our culture or whatever sit on
[1:11:32] them and so is every
[1:11:35] tribe you know actually in our own
[1:11:39] tribe in our own
[1:11:41] family in the of the where I come
[1:11:46] from the one the demons the spirits of
[1:11:49] our
[1:11:50] tribe sit on my
[1:11:53] uncle and let me tell you he has made a
[1:11:56] lot of
[1:11:57] money because many people go to him for
[1:11:59] him to enchant
[1:12:01] them if I mention his name probably
[1:12:03] you've heard of
[1:12:04] him but this is not a place for me to
[1:12:07] mention his name I don't want to give
[1:12:09] him
[1:12:10] publicity but I tell you what they have
[1:12:14] the
[1:12:15] powers they surely do when I went to him
[1:12:17] I've ever gone to him one
[1:12:19] time in his house and then I saw all the
[1:12:22] things that he had put on his wall
[1:12:25] and I challenged him and I said is your
[1:12:28] god
[1:12:29] alive he said Son do you want to prove
[1:12:32] that my God is
[1:12:34] alive my God is powerful I tell he's
[1:12:38] even more powerful than your
[1:12:40] God I told him what makes you think that
[1:12:44] he said all the pastors come here for
[1:12:47] power the come here for
[1:12:50] power you know they all come here and
[1:12:52] the man has made himself a kingdom
[1:12:56] he's very very rich when he's going in
[1:12:58] the village there you know he goes with
[1:13:01] a I don't know how many cars
[1:13:05] following probably 50 cars and with the
[1:13:08] people who are
[1:13:09] there you know spirits on
[1:13:13] them they all doing
[1:13:17] enchantment and they're speaking in Tong
[1:13:20] and you know they are there and they go
[1:13:22] in the mountains there and when they go
[1:13:25] everybody just runs away because they
[1:13:27] know the
[1:13:28] power of the of this area has
[1:13:32] come but I stood right before his
[1:13:34] face I told him those people that you're
[1:13:37] talking
[1:13:38] about they don't worship the god I
[1:13:41] worship the god I worship is far more
[1:13:44] powerful than your
[1:13:46] God they told me you ought not to have
[1:13:49] done
[1:13:51] that because it means I have challenged
[1:13:54] him
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] and I may not leave but until today I am
[1:14:00] alive until today let me tell you I'm
[1:14:03] alive and I was
[1:14:05] purposed to even PCH out his
[1:14:09] sons and show them my God the god of the
[1:14:12] Bible and when I started out with one of
[1:14:15] them you know he he he tried to he told
[1:14:19] me I'm coming I'm coming and then from
[1:14:22] then he never answered my
[1:14:23] phone what it tell you and he's one of
[1:14:26] the people that always go there in the
[1:14:28] in the Inner
[1:14:30] Circle to do the
[1:14:33] enchantments they must have
[1:14:36] tried and they failed and his father
[1:14:39] must have told him stay away from those
[1:14:43] people so I'm here to tell you something
[1:14:46] witchcraft is
[1:14:52] real my uncle told me
[1:14:55] I tell you what we do I can I can make
[1:14:58] someone
[1:15:00] dig for the whole
[1:15:03] night said really how do you do
[1:15:07] that don't worry I told I can make
[1:15:10] someone
[1:15:11] dig even
[1:15:15] K and these people are not
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:22] bling Pastor are you losing your mind
[1:15:26] I'm not losing my mind if we don't
[1:15:28] believe that witchcraft
[1:15:30] exists we don't believe God
[1:15:34] exists but God is greater than
[1:15:38] witchcraft that is one thing we have to
[1:15:42] understand he brought the men amen who
[1:15:44] were the ones that were enchanting the H
[1:15:46] of
[1:15:48] Egypt he brought them all the Winds of
[1:15:52] Egypt were behind them
[1:15:55] all the Winds of Egypt were
[1:15:57] behind the roads they
[1:16:00] have and when they took those roads and
[1:16:04] cast them down those roads became
[1:16:07] serpents just like the road of Moses
[1:16:09] became a
[1:16:10] serpent how many roads of
[1:16:13] Moses one how many roads of the
[1:16:18] Egyptians
[1:16:20] many
[1:16:22] many many many
[1:16:25] witchcraft many
[1:16:27] Sorcerers many a lot of power but let me
[1:16:31] I don't
[1:16:32] care how much someone thinks they
[1:16:36] Bewitched how much someone thinks they
[1:16:39] are under some kind of
[1:16:43] spare if they test the God of this
[1:16:48] message witchcraft cannot stand before
[1:16:51] the God of this message
[1:16:55] that's why message Believers we do not
[1:16:58] believe in being
[1:17:02] Bewitched am I preaching to Believers
[1:17:04] here
[1:17:05] tonight we do not believe in being
[1:17:09] Bewitched if you feel your
[1:17:11] Bewitched go in
[1:17:13] prayer and if you pray sincerely
[1:17:18] whatever powers that have been upon
[1:17:21] you they will go back to the center
[1:17:25] let me tell you I don't believe that
[1:17:28] there is witchcraft in in
[1:17:32] Israel upon Jacob he said there is no
[1:17:36] enchantment there is no witchcraft upon
[1:17:39] Israel upon Jacob why we are people for
[1:17:43] his
[1:17:45] name we try to do
[1:17:48] it cannot attack us it cannot defeat us
[1:17:53] because we have a higher power
[1:17:56] power we have a higher
[1:17:59] anointing we have a higher
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:03] force and when he threw they threw down
[1:18:05] all their
[1:18:06] roads with their
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:18] enchantments and another one
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:25] then Moses
[1:18:27] cameon said what are we going to do
[1:18:31] Moses told him you know you remember I'm
[1:18:33] your
[1:18:34] God CU God told him you will be a God
[1:18:37] and be your
[1:18:39] Prophet so told
[1:18:42] him you
[1:18:44] watch so the snakes
[1:18:47] came with all the demon
[1:18:50] power if you read
[1:18:53] demonology a prophet speaks up about
[1:18:55] demons in religious real and demons in
[1:18:57] Physical
[1:19:00] Realm not every demons come in a
[1:19:03] Physical Realm others come in a
[1:19:05] religious
[1:19:09] real someone coming
[1:19:11] religiously as if they're very spiritual
[1:19:15] here we have seen some people like that
[1:19:17] someone is over spiritualizing
[1:19:20] themselves but when they demon
[1:19:22] possessed you have to design that this
[1:19:24] spirit of God or it's a spirit of the
[1:19:27] devil praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:19:30] when these Spirits came to attack the
[1:19:33] road of
[1:19:34] Moses the Bible says simply opened his
[1:19:39] mouth simply open his mouth and these
[1:19:43] ones could just humble
[1:19:46] themselves just yes
[1:19:48] sir you want us to go inside there no
[1:19:52] problem
[1:19:55] they just enter the mouth and after they
[1:19:58] enter the mouth of the snake of the
[1:20:00] serpent of
[1:20:02] Moses it became a Ro again and he picked
[1:20:06] it up in other words listen Pharaoh now
[1:20:11] I possess all the powers of
[1:20:15] Egypt in my hands and there is no power
[1:20:20] that can Prevail against
[1:20:22] me Hallelujah let me tell you brothers
[1:20:25] and sisters we as the message Believers
[1:20:29] we possess all the
[1:20:31] powers of of heaven and on
[1:20:34] Earth it is in our hands as long as we
[1:20:38] have the word of God this word of God is

[1:20:43] Power above every
[1:20:46] principality above every
[1:20:48] Spirit there is no weapon formed against
[1:20:51] us
[1:20:54] the battle is not ours it is the Lord
[1:20:59] is you find Believers shaken with
[1:21:02] witchcraft which is nothing to
[1:21:07] us do you know

[1:22:11] cannot be
[1:22:15] Beed if you are Beed it means you have
[1:22:20] not yet been filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:22:25] number one number two you do not know
[1:22:26] who you
[1:22:28] are they will try
[1:22:30] to I remember even when I was still a
[1:22:33] little
[1:22:34] boy of about 12 years I was going to
[1:22:39] school and I had that Revelation
[1:22:42] already and you know how many know these
[1:22:44] things they put in the in the
[1:22:47] crossroad you know people when people go
[1:22:50] to which
[1:22:51] doctors they tell them now you go in the
[1:22:54] in the Crossroad that's where you should
[1:22:56] wash all the
[1:22:58] cures so they go with some hubs and some
[1:23:02] enchantment they begin Wasing doing
[1:23:05] enchantments they throw in the
[1:23:08] crossroad how many know about
[1:23:10] that you you have old in the city you
[1:23:12] don't
[1:23:13] know you know some of you know but you
[1:23:16] don't want to raise up
[1:23:18] your and
[1:23:20] so rumor had it
[1:23:24] when you jump them without
[1:23:27] seeing you get elepant is it
[1:23:33] called you get a very big
[1:23:36] leg and it can end up
[1:23:39] busting and so uh we had seen people
[1:23:43] that had got the
[1:23:45] same we knew it happens one day I was
[1:23:49] working with my
[1:23:50] friends and they told me and then we
[1:23:53] came across it very early in the
[1:23:55] morning it was about 6:30
[1:24:00] too and then my friends told me you said
[1:24:05] you believe in
[1:24:08] God can you jump this
[1:24:10] thing and then I was tell of course I
[1:24:13] believe in God of course as I was
[1:24:15] talking I was still fearing inside there
[1:24:19] I cannot Sur jump
[1:24:20] this because I don't want to die
[1:24:24] but the the man these boys provoked
[1:24:27] me they said no if you believe in God
[1:24:30] for sure jump this thing today and then
[1:24:33] we shall also believe that God is
[1:24:36] there when this boy provoked me like
[1:24:39] that but is it's just like I broke into
[1:24:42] a
[1:24:42] revelation I said but isn't isn't God
[1:24:45] surely
[1:24:46] there I said no I believe God is so I
[1:24:49] told this boy okay was me and I jumped
[1:24:53] it
[1:24:56] and and as soon as I jumped it I began
[1:24:59] feeling my my my leg
[1:25:03] tingling I began to feel you know those
[1:25:06] things like like the
[1:25:10] Sparks I told him I'm fine I'm
[1:25:12] fine are you fine are you fine I'm fine
[1:25:15] but for sure I was feeling already
[1:25:16] things were beginning to work themselves
[1:25:19] there I was
[1:25:21] Anglican but I was part of the Revival
[1:25:24] of the
[1:25:26] we believed in prayer so I started
[1:25:29] praying I said God if you are there in
[1:25:32] heaven prove to me now by not ashaming
[1:25:36] me before my
[1:25:37] friends so as we were walking I was
[1:25:41] behaving as if I'm feeling nothing but
[1:25:43] for sure things were operating
[1:25:45] themselves inside
[1:25:47] there but friends by the time we reached
[1:25:50] school I had even forgotten about it
[1:25:53] nothing happened to
[1:25:55] me nothing
[1:25:58] absolutely the leg did not buge
[1:26:00] out and let me tell you I believe from
[1:26:03] that time that God is God and is greater
[1:26:06] than
[1:26:10] witchcraft hallelujah amen our God is
[1:26:13] greater than
[1:26:16] enchantments never fear
[1:26:18] such when go when when you know when you
[1:26:21] when God reveals to you something like
[1:26:23] that
[1:26:25] of course they will try to attack the
[1:26:27] Believers they will try to attack but
[1:26:30] because they try to attack it doesn't
[1:26:33] mean they will
[1:26:34] prevail you have to take your position
[1:26:37] as a
[1:26:38] Believer and say I don't believe that I
[1:26:41] can be
[1:26:43] Beed tell your neighbor don't believe I
[1:26:45] can be
[1:26:46] Beed I am a royal priesthood I am a holy
[1:26:50] nation I am a people of God I am the for
[1:26:54] his
[1:26:55] name no power of hell no power of
[1:26:59] Darkness can Prevail against
[1:27:03] man amen hallelujah yes so we don't
[1:27:06] that's why we don't
[1:27:08] respect those kind of rituals of our
[1:27:14] cultures we don't respect them we only
[1:27:18] respect the culture or cultural norms
[1:27:21] that agree with the word
[1:27:27] that's why we don't they call it
[1:27:35] busting don't do that we don't death
[1:27:38] because those cultur those
[1:27:40] Norms are against the
[1:27:44] scripture the only one that has power to
[1:27:47] bust death is God
[1:27:52] himself and he did on the
[1:27:55] cross and he said is finished so that is
[1:27:58] a deception of the
[1:28:01] enemy and we don't do those
[1:28:03] rituals tell you now you put this on
[1:28:05] your mouth now do like this and now you
[1:28:08] speak like
[1:28:10] this Believers Never be a part of
[1:28:14] that when you go to BU someone they tell

[1:28:34] will grow very well every man will be
[1:28:37] attracted that is
[1:28:39] rubbish believe that we don't do those
[1:28:42] things we don't believe in those kind of
[1:28:44] things why we are a royal
[1:28:48] priesthood we are holy

[1:31:29] this on the and the fullness thereof is
[1:31:32] the
[1:31:33] Lord the Hebrews wanted Goan because it
[1:31:36] was the best of the land of
[1:31:41] Egypt later on it would become the place
[1:31:44] of their
[1:31:47] slavery they suffered in what appeared
[1:31:49] to be a blessing of God
[1:31:54] but you you see they did not know that
[1:31:57] this suffering was not going to be
[1:32:00] permanent they did not know the best was
[1:32:03] yet to
[1:32:04] come they did not know these people

[1:33:25] trouble here trouble
[1:33:27] there you know I always say
[1:33:29] this the Jews while they were in gion

[1:33:38] never knew
[1:33:41] Joseph you look in the window what did
[1:33:44] he see
[1:33:47] slaves look at
[1:33:49] this when Moses came the prophet of God
[1:33:54] he looked through the same window what
[1:33:56] did he see the
[1:33:58] elect the people of
[1:34:00] God hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:34:03] denominations have called us what

[1:34:15] called us
[1:34:17] poor that we come from a poor
[1:34:20] family that's what they've called us
[1:34:23] that's why the world has
[1:34:24] called but what does the message call
[1:34:27] us God has sent us a prophet in our
[1:34:30] generation and by the way this message
[1:34:32] has told us
[1:34:34] things who we are and said my people
[1:34:38] shall know who they
[1:34:40] are and what they stand
[1:34:43] for there shall be an invisible
[1:34:47] Army an army which cannot be
[1:34:51] defeated which means everything will try
[1:34:53] to fight
[1:34:55] you last will try to fight
[1:34:59] you yes the word will try to

[1:35:22] me tell you never accept such
[1:35:25] testimon no child of God is
[1:35:29] poor by the virtue of the fact that you
[1:35:32] believe the message of the
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:35] hour you have great spiritual
[1:35:39] riches which are able also to translate
[1:35:41] into physical
[1:35:45] riches Moses would look in the same
[1:35:47] window and we would see theant people of
[1:35:51] God what this message has told us
[1:35:54] that we are the people of
[1:35:56] God he said one time the prophet came up
[1:35:58] and he said I now no longer call you
[1:36:04] bride I call you his
[1:36:08] wife I no longer call you church I call
[1:36:12] you
[1:36:14] bride what happened it was God telling
[1:36:18] us who we are
[1:36:23] hallelujah hallelujah and as they were
[1:36:26] exiting Egypt in Exodus
[1:36:29] 11 they had to eat bitter
[1:36:33] HS each house had to eat a
[1:36:36] lamb they had to eat UNL
[1:36:39] bread whatever God told them through
[1:36:43] Moses they had to do if we are willing
[1:36:46] and an interested to exit this
[1:36:49] world do I have people here willing to
[1:36:52] go in the rapture
[1:36:54] if we are will to say to the word
[1:36:56] goodbye we should obey this
[1:36:59] message we should amen submit oursel to
[1:37:02] the word of
[1:37:05] God to refuse the
[1:37:07] word is a
[1:37:14] sin Let Me emphasize on this a little
[1:37:16] bit can you read 1 Samuel 15: 23
[1:37:47] first Samuel 1523
[1:37:54] for Rebellion is as the sin of
[1:37:56] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:37:58] iniquity and idolatry because thou H has
[1:38:00] rejected the word of the Lord he has
[1:38:02] also rejected thee from being
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:18] King if God did God speak to
[1:38:21] Moses did he have that say the Lord
[1:38:25] it is the word of God did God speak to
[1:38:27] William BR you that say the Lord that is
[1:38:31] the word of God and that it for every
[1:38:35] believer so we as Believers are not
[1:38:39] supposed to debate with every part of
[1:38:41] the word with any part of the
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:46] word when says under no circumstance
[1:38:48] should beli unbeliever
[1:38:54] believe
[1:38:56] say
[1:38:58] say young people you should say
[1:39:03] Amen it's a word of
[1:39:05] God and you find a brother wanting to
[1:39:07] marry a
[1:39:10] Catholic you find a sister getting
[1:39:11] married to a
[1:39:13] Muslim saying after all he loves me who
[1:39:18] told you is the basis of
[1:39:21] marriage the basis of marriage is
[1:39:24] God when we say the best of marriage is
[1:39:27] love we mean
[1:39:30] God because the says God is
[1:39:34] love amen if the other person has no God
[1:39:37] in
[1:39:39] them then they don't love you
[1:39:43] genuinely the love they have will
[1:39:46] fail but the love of God never
[1:39:50] fails charity never fails
[1:39:54] that is the love of
[1:39:55] God but the other types of love will
[1:39:59] fail if every believer could follow
[1:40:03] that we would have few
[1:40:07] divorces but why do people's love for
[1:40:09] each other
[1:40:13] faint why because they do not have God
[1:40:16] in in
[1:40:18] them the love of God is not in
[1:40:22] them the love of God is in
[1:40:25] you the more you dislike each
[1:40:28] other the more you love each other
[1:40:32] because you have some stronger
[1:40:34] Force within each of you bringing it
[1:40:38] together that is the force of God God is
[1:40:41] love
[1:40:44] himself and that cannot
[1:40:48] fail but you see you find people getting
[1:40:50] attracted to each other because of their
[1:40:52] looks
[1:40:55] not because of
[1:40:57] God but to rebel against the
[1:41:01] word is as a sin of
[1:41:04] Witchcraft
[1:41:07] stubbornness is as
[1:41:12] iniquity and
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:19] idolatry so you find people that you can
[1:41:21] preach the message too
[1:41:24] they hear it you say Believers says
[1:41:28] fornication should never be mentioned
[1:41:29] among
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:33] you and someone hears that and says it's
[1:41:37] not a big
[1:41:38] deal is not a big
[1:41:40] deal that is
[1:41:43] stubborness that is
[1:41:46] rebellion you've taken the word of God
[1:41:48] in
[1:41:50] vain we must fear God brethren
[1:41:54] how do you fear God by taking his word
[1:41:59] serious we must fear God by taking his
[1:42:02] word
[1:42:04] serious by being ready to live for his
[1:42:06] word for
[1:42:09] him I have no life to live for
[1:42:13] myself I have no life of my
[1:42:16] own you think you have a life no all you
[1:42:20] have is this flesh
[1:42:23] flesh is just
[1:42:25] soil it is just
[1:42:27] magots today you have it tomorrow you
[1:42:31] don't did you know that it will just go
[1:42:34] fly
[1:42:36] away but let me tell you we have a
[1:42:39] body all those that believe in God and
[1:42:43] are waiting upon his
[1:42:45] appearing we have a supernal
[1:42:48] body that is beyond this
[1:42:50] natural as body
[1:42:53] and whenever you believe in the word you
[1:42:56] are hearing from your
[1:42:58] theop you are connecting to your
[1:43:00] spiritual
[1:43:02] body Hallelujah and one of these days
[1:43:05] brothers and sisters those of you who
[1:43:07] have heard the word those of you have
[1:43:09] believe the word one of these days we
[1:43:13] are going to walk into those
[1:43:15] bodies Hallelujah we shall have
[1:43:19] overcome we are the people for his
[1:43:22] name we are not here in vain we are not
[1:43:25] wasting time we are building
[1:43:29] something we are working into
[1:43:33] Hallelujah my my my my amen and we
[1:43:36] notice here the children of Israel
[1:43:40] reached a place where they had now to
[1:43:41] cross
[1:43:44] over you
[1:43:46] see this is where their faith was
[1:43:49] tested can they still believe the word
[1:43:53] that the word cannot guide them into a
[1:43:56] dead
[1:44:00] end sister Faith that they had to
[1:44:04] believe the word cannot guide
[1:44:08] them into a dead
[1:44:14] end the word of God cannot do
[1:44:19] that the Bible says the word of God
[1:44:23] light unto my
[1:44:25] feet he leads
[1:44:27] me in the path of
[1:44:30] righteousness
[1:44:32] for as long as you were under the word
[1:44:35] you submit your entire
[1:44:39] life to the word and you said not
[1:44:44] reasoning you say yes to the word in
[1:44:48] every place to say yes to the word yes
[1:44:50] to the word yes to the word you believe
[1:44:53] the word will never lead you to a dead
[1:44:59] end sometimes like the children of
[1:45:02] Israel we reach the Red Sea and we feel
[1:45:06] it is a dead
[1:45:07] end but let me tell you brother sister
[1:45:10] when they reach the Red

[1:45:31] world in the in the
[1:45:36] denominations you brought me here in the
[1:45:39] message to
[1:45:43] die things are not working out you know
[1:45:46] when I was the denominations things were
[1:45:49] very well but since I came into the
