[1:34:06] Miriam took a tambourine and she began

[1:34:46] that decision to go on over to cross
[1:34:50] over to the next
[1:34:52] phase hallelujah it's the year of the
[1:34:56] next
[1:34:57] phase because we have
[1:34:59] decided we have made the right
[1:35:02] decision we decided to esteem the cause
[1:35:05] of Christ the
[1:35:09] reproach oh my that's what Moses decided
[1:35:12] to do
[1:35:13] right and what happened they cross
[1:35:17] over they cross over hallelujah
[1:35:20] hallelujah oh my pastor mgus God bless
[1:35:24] you this is before the whole world I
[1:35:28] want to tell you it's going to be the
[1:35:30] next phase for you also in the
[1:35:32] ministry
[1:35:35] Hallelujah he told
[1:35:38] me he has just told me and he looked at
[1:35:42] me and said you gave me small
[1:35:46] time he did not finish the devil very
[1:35:50] well today he did not
[1:35:53] preach he was just just trying to show
[1:35:57] the
[1:35:58] devil what he can do with
[1:36:01] him praise God Amen and to those of you
[1:36:04] who want to hear him
[1:36:06] more tell your pastor to contact
[1:36:12] me hallelujah hallelujah and then I'm
[1:36:14] sure Pastor M will be
[1:36:17] happy he's a very busy
[1:36:20] man but I'm sure he'll be happy to visit
[1:36:24] the butam says in the message Revelation
[1:36:29] 4 he says leave your
[1:36:35] sermons let your sermon be
[1:36:39] lived and it is the voice of God that
[1:36:42] will bring reproach to them that
[1:36:47] rejected if there was a man of
[1:36:50] God
[1:36:52] is that man or
[1:36:54] woman leave your
[1:36:57] sermons don't try to preach
[1:37:00] them if you are not called to be a
[1:37:03] preacher you get all mixed up and how
[1:37:07] and messed
[1:37:09] up you will get people Tangled
[1:37:12] Up you will just re them and yourself
[1:37:16] too just leave your
[1:37:18] sermon the preacher like Pastor mgus is
[1:37:23] called to preach
[1:37:25] his and to leave it
[1:37:29] to if you can't leave it then you you
[1:37:33] stop
[1:37:34] preaching but you are
[1:37:36] supposed to leave your
[1:37:40] sermons and the reason why I read
[1:37:44] that the pr the sermon he preached
[1:37:48] today he has lived it
[1:37:52] he has
[1:37:53] lived like I told you yesterday he had a
[1:37:57] great
[1:37:58] vision he's a very able
[1:38:01] man very
[1:38:02] intelligent you know he very good
[1:38:05] education he had many
[1:38:08] aspirations but he made a
[1:38:10] choice he made a
[1:38:12] decision to serve
[1:38:15] God and so that's leave
[1:38:18] someone praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:38:20] and and uh I was I was talking to him
[1:38:23] some years
[1:38:25] ago if a lot
[1:38:27] terries we would love to hear her
[1:38:29] testimony and maybe in the next youth
[1:38:34] convention we will put a
[1:38:36] slot because many of you have
[1:38:39] questions how can I get
[1:38:42] married how can I find my lifetime
[1:38:46] partner they have a very good
[1:38:50] testimony
[1:38:51] on how God led him to his
[1:38:56] wife we were just very few maybe 15 at
[1:39:00] the
[1:39:01] time or 20
[1:39:03] 25 and there were no Believers in the
[1:39:07] church uh that were ready to get married
[1:39:10] to
[1:39:13] him and there were no Believers that he
[1:39:16] was ready to get married
[1:39:19] to but we preach in the
[1:39:23] message under no
[1:39:25] circumstance should a Believer Mar an
[1:39:28] unbeliever now most of you young people
[1:39:30] take that as a
[1:39:33] rule as a law and you're
[1:39:37] offended but when it came
[1:39:40] time to preach that in the church in
[1:39:44] Ethiopia I was very
[1:39:47] cautious I knew if I have to preach
[1:39:50] anything
[1:39:51] I would have to have full
[1:39:54] confidence that God will make it come to
[1:39:58] pass or I will be threatening my entire
[1:40:01] Ministry
[1:40:03] there because people will no longer
[1:40:05] believe the
[1:40:07] message I knew we in the planting
[1:40:11] season so I went in my study
[1:40:13] room and began praying I said God I know
[1:40:17] that this is what your Prophet
[1:40:19] says and I believe it but sincerely in
[1:40:24] the whole of
[1:40:26] Ethiopia in the whole of
[1:40:28] Ethiopia there's 25
[1:40:32] Believers and how can I stand before
[1:40:36] them tell them no
[1:40:40] circumstance should I believe a and
[1:40:43] unbeliever they will ask me
[1:40:46] realistically tell
[1:40:47] us we I'm not compatible to the other
[1:40:50] one
[1:40:52] and these are the only Believers
[1:40:53] here so how what what do you want me to
[1:40:56] do I had no
[1:40:58] answers I was faced with a
[1:41:01] choice to either compromise the
[1:41:05] word or preach it as
[1:41:09] easy it was very difficult I think that
[1:41:13] was the hardest someone I prepared
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:17] for I was very
[1:41:19] emotional but anyhow I came and preached
[1:41:23] it and I preached faith I told believe
[1:41:27] God God is able to give you a
[1:41:30] wife the prophet and I said the prophet
[1:41:33] says no circumstance should I
[1:41:38] believe and then I was talking about I
[1:41:40] think
[1:41:41] Abraham and I said how he had believed
[1:41:45] God and when God gave him his only
[1:41:48] son you know he went down there
[1:41:51] and he had made up his mind it's all I
[1:41:54] got but I'm going to kill
[1:41:57] him because you know I I believe
[1:42:02] God whatever he says I will do so as
[1:42:06] Abraham took his
[1:42:08] knife to kill his
[1:42:10] son then L and behold the voice told him
[1:42:15] abrah Abraham don't do that and when he
[1:42:18] looked on the side so
[1:42:22] alarm and then I gave another example I
[1:42:26] said
[1:42:28] Adam God said it's not good for a man to
[1:42:30] live
[1:42:32] alone and here he was alone and
[1:42:37] sad and he did not even know that why he
[1:42:40] was alone but God knew because he knew
[1:42:44] he needed a
[1:42:46] wife rather if you're not married and
[1:42:48] you are in in the age of marriage
[1:42:53] don't deceive us that you are
[1:42:56] happy God said is not good so it is not
[1:43:01] good for you to be
[1:43:04] single when you are ready for
[1:43:07] marriage so God said so not me and
[1:43:11] that's why he said to
[1:43:12] Adam and so when what happened God put
[1:43:16] Adam to
[1:43:17] sleep and when Adam woke up Eve was
[1:43:21] already standing there so when when Eve
[1:43:24] turned when Adam
[1:43:26] turned he saw her and he saying B of my
[1:43:31] bornes of My Flesh she shall be called a
[1:43:34] woman and so and Pastor morus was
[1:43:36] interpreting that
[1:43:39] service and he told me I think within
[1:43:42] that service or
[1:43:44] afterwards
[1:43:46] Hallelujah my
[1:43:48] wife is somewhere my wife is a
[1:43:53] Believer my wife is already
[1:43:56] born and she's somewhere and one day I'm
[1:44:00] going to lift up my eyes I'm going to
[1:44:03] turn my side and I will see
[1:44:07] her listen when he heard the
[1:44:09] word he
[1:44:12] decided he did not instead feel bad and
[1:44:15] they begin to judge and to question and
[1:44:19] begin he believed
[1:44:22] it without
[1:44:24] question and he gave a prophecy over his
[1:44:28] life and he declared
[1:44:30] it and in our first wedding in
[1:44:35] Ethiopia our
[1:44:37] first of the first sister who
[1:44:42] believe a group of Kenyans
[1:44:46] came and that Sunday their pastor
[1:44:51] our precious brother
[1:44:53] wck preached that Sunday
[1:44:56] service and as I
[1:44:58] came pastoras was here
[1:45:01] interpreting but everybody was crying
[1:45:03] and praying after the
[1:45:05] service and I came on this pull pit
[1:45:07] where the pastor
[1:45:09] was and and and I was you know I was
[1:45:12] also praying and so when I lifted up my
[1:45:15] eyes I began to speak to the people some
[1:45:18] some people were on the altar
[1:45:21] praying and crying tears falling down
[1:45:25] they were all
[1:45:29] messy and Pastor was also
[1:45:32] messy I love that messed up
[1:45:36] situation miracles happen in that
[1:45:41] atmosphere not when you out there
[1:45:43] debating and and questioning believe the
[1:45:47] word if they call you a fanatic stop be
[1:45:50] it
[1:45:53] and he raised up his
[1:45:55] head and when he turned his
[1:45:58] eyes the first person person he looked
[1:46:01] at was Sister
[1:46:06] M Pastor morus come to the office he
[1:46:10] told me

[2:04:59] confused how are they going to travel at
[2:05:01] night and things like
[2:05:03] that the reason is because they
[2:05:05] threatened to charge us extra if people
[2:05:07] are sleeping over
