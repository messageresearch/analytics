Christ [Music] thank you brother martin for a wonderful service while we are still standing to turn to our Bibles in the Book of Luke foreign foreign but may God help us and I'm happy to see all of you have made it this morning we are getting to read the scripture this morning and we are believing that the Lord will speak to us amen may the Lord fill the desires of your heart we will read verses 33 and 34 of Luke 7. Luke foreign for John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say he has a devil the son of man is calm eating and drinking and you say Behold a gluttonous man and a wine Bieber a friend of publicans and sinners is [Music] God bless the reading of his word he may have your seats this morning by the grace of God I would like to speak to you this morning on the subject of the scene as friend all right so John the Baptist came eating and drink um the son of man John the Baptist came and he was not the scripture says he was eating he was neither eating bread nor drinking wine and they say they had a devil may I believe so the people never accepted John the Baptist because according to them the way he was because he was you know drinking eating locusts and wild honey yeah yeah um and the way he was dressed you know the way his hair was made and because the Jews were holy people and they had kept all the Traditions as it was given unto them by Moses they spoke and said that John the Baptist had a devil and indeed according to all the Jewish teachings John the Baptist looked like he had a devil praise the name of the Lord and then Jesus came for Jesus was eating and drinking like the rest of them and they say look at this look at this friend of publicans and sinners so among the things that Jesus was blamed or condemned for was that he was a friend of sinners [Music] the people that were blaming and condemning Jesus were actually the people that had been trained under the law of Moses [Music] they had been raised up under that they have been trained to live holy they had been told not to touch not to tests and you know they have been raised like that and so they had developed a conscience [Music] [Music] that actually the Jews had kept for years and years before the coming of Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] and you know whenever there is a new thing that is always have to be a change a change of course a change of direction if you want listen church if you want God to do something new for you how to open up your mind and your heart so we see that when Jesus came the Jews never received him and the reason why the Jews never received him because he had received the people that according to them were vile it is [Music] and even Peter himself the disciple of Jesus after Jesus had died and rose again yesterday Peter refused to preach among the Gentiles because according to the him the Gentiles were vile people said things that the Jews were not supposed to eat so according to Peter the Gentiles [Music] and they were not worthy of the gospel of Christ but you know the Jews and the Disciples of Jesus they had one thing that they needed to understand that is what we spoke on on Sunday sister Grace it is hallelujah amen do you know Grace have you found the grace these people did not understand that Grace had to go beyond their tradition and she said how to go beyond what they knew it had to go beyond their Doctrine you know God loves us to the extent that he can break all the existing laws [Music] in order to reach one sinner for when he came he called himself a shepherd and he called himself a good shepherd and he said a Good Shepherd will leave 1909. praise the name of [Music] [Music] but according to Christ the gospel was not and never has it ever been meant for the righteousness the gospel was always meant for The Sinner let us look at a version [Music] it says for John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine the son of man has come eating and drinking and you say look a man who is a glutton and a heavy wind Drinker oh man a woman tonight A friend of tax collectors and and sinners including non-observant Jews and here is the verse 35 he says yet wisdom is Vindicated and shown to be right by all her children his children and here in Brackets it says by the lifestyle a moral character named pieces now Jesus is a friend of sinners yes but it is kind of ironic his followers their lifestyle or whatever their moral characters the followers of Jesus they have this moral standards they have this lifestyle by the name they have the good works and you cannot find anywhere else they are people who follow Muhammad another who follow Buddha Buddha and others if you want to see people that have good morals [Music] come and look at the followers of Jesus Christ but what happened followers of Jesus we are supposed to be sinners in other words when Christ comes to you only comes to you while you are a sinner but by the time he's done with you you are no longer a city praise the name of the Lord Christ he's a sinner's friend in all ages but we are here to support now to the sport now he says that they fail to see it [Music] because it was in human flesh I wonder if we will do the same thing I wonder if we will make the sad mistake that they did I failed to know him they fail to understand who Christ was and why he came they fail to understand why he loved Sinners they fail to understand why he always Associated himself with Sinners and do we believe that Jesus Christ is also the same in our generation [Music] he was identified in a human body a boy that had no education that you've never known him going to school he had no credentials even come out of any he even come out of any organization of that day no education he had no reputation nothing but a crazy man he was a friend of listen to these words he was illegitimately born away and taking his name as the Son of God or calling himself a prophet that this girlian so-called a prophet now all the words I've read people's opinion was about Jesus attack [Music] he's a white people what was the first miracle that Jesus did he turned water into wine praise the name of the Lord is supper they drunk wine I cannot see your thinking but remember when he created that wine at the marriage of Canada the Bible says they drank too much they became satisfied hallelujah amen the Bible did not say they became drunk but they became satisfied and Jesus was associating himself yes with the people of Norway protection now than two other telling them and he was a Man From Galilee he had no credentials whatsoever he had no education whatsoever you know if Jesus was in our generation today few people would regard him to be anything about anything [Music] because Jesus was the worst according to the description of the Jewish cultural religion is but the word was made made manifest amen associating himself with Cena if you don't want Sinners to be associated with Christ where do you want them to be if he has not or had not associated himself with Sinners you would have failed at his mission by the mission of Jesus was seen us foreign what was in the foreign hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord this God has put in my heart for a few weeks now and uh I I trust that you know I'll bring it with the same father was made manifest as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of who rejected him the holy people who condemned him the holy people who put him on the cross who received him the sinners hallelujah amen hallelujah amen he's the same one who said you know man he's party and he called the people to come now it happened to my check all his friends all the holy people all the people of his caliber the good men and the good women she called them to come but every one of them had an excuse me I'm sorry I'm going to party I'm sorry I'm going to marry I'm sorry I have an uh an errand to run here and none of them came on listen Friends The Rapture is coming do you believe that if you behave like Pharisees you will be surprised you will be surprised that you may never be a part of it oh this good man who had an invitation who had the message they did not go they bargained they failed to go because of their righteous indignation we have entitlements this is ours this is our message because that is the mindset of a Pharisees praise the name of the Lord of these people who receive the invitations foreign and I've had people who say that this message is not for babies [Music] hallelujah amen we must go on the road and we must tell it hallelujah amen they will come from there and they came in and everybody amen because there was somebody on his spot it's still the same thing today and so is it today when we see this great Holy Ghost Move May the Manifest as many as received him to them give me the power to become Sons and Daughters of God Jesus Christ identified the same Name by his word in every generation yes praise the name of the Lord identified himself by giving us the message he has given power to become the sons of God we know sin is unbelief of that word sin is not drinking smoking foreign foreign if you do any of those things if you begin going to bars and and is it called whatever it is [Music] you know and they begin smoking begin flirting with women no 10 suck it is going to adopt your fornication you know if you begin doing those things it is an indication that in you there is no faith because if you have faith in the word of God you will not do those things that faith in the word of God will be your protection it will be the law of God written not in stone but written on your heart [Music] praise the name of Allah foreign you'd rather accept something else we all the Bible says we were born in sins people can be religious and yet still seeing us before the Lord all people were actually born in sins having not previously done any evil acts [Music] the moment you were born you are actually a sinner having not previously done anything bad foreign [Music] [Music] so Jesus being without sin that yes because in Christ there was no unbelief in the Christ there was no sin he knew not sin so him being without sin he was the only one who worthy yeah he however had to become sin in order to reduce second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 and according for he made him to be seen for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him praise the name of the Lord Jesus we know that because he was tested when the devil came to him he's tested him time and time again he says if you be the Son of God make these stones to become bread if Jesus let me ask you do you think that Jesus was able to do that yes foreign he did not become a sinner they are full come on only because he knew who he was he knew he was the son of God he knew he was the word of God and therefore the devil tempted him because Jesus was able and could be able to sin but he did not because he knew who he was and that's the only the reason why Jesus came because the children of God because they have not realized who they are right and that's why when Jesus came on he always Associated himself with Sinners because he knew they did not know who they are he knew the moment he goes around them [Music] will make them come to themselves I am not supposed to be a sinner I believe the word of God and the moment I believe Jesus Christ [Music] is not my life it is [Music] in you know he gives you that light she gives you that [Music] did not know who he was [Music] it means you yourself are the word of God if we can only know who we are true the devil cannot overcome users as many as received himself [Music] he gave power money oh my goodness he gave them power do you realize foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] but the moment you were told you are not actually the son of a farmer you were actually holy it was hit probably you were a son of a king hey you you will come to yourself you you hurt yourself what happened the first thing you're going to do is to go to the bathroom [Music] have you never seen women with such nails [Music] Daughters of farmers that's the kind of news the first thing you're going to do sister is to go tightening up your nails you remove all that that the pain because you are told you are a daughter of a king you are coming to yourself you are realizing who you are Hallelujah man you're gonna you're going to clean yourself up you're going to dress like a child of a king we're going to uh you know begin working different even your work will change do you understand what I'm talking about even your work will change you cannot walk like a farmer's child you'll begin walking like a child Hallelujah amen you know children of a king who really know who they are they walk gracefully Hallelujah they just walk aggressively your work is not going to be the Walk of others you will walk watch others just to know they are different from you now listen to me you are here you'll clean it up why do you do all that to be who you are not to be who you are and you are doing it because you have realized hallelujah amen that is why we don't have the gospel of do's and don'ts we have the Gospels foreign praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah for Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Lord being made a cast for us it is only Jesus could be a sinner's friend yes because he actually was cast so whenever Jesus comes to you my brother yes I know what you you've been through many Choice him I know what it is not the righteous he specializes in Sinners he specializes to do things thought impossible the world has today has only one purpose that's the only purpose of the World Cup that's the only reason why we preach area that's the reason why we print books that's the reason why we go for evangelism that's the reason why we start a church and put chairs for people to come yes that's what we do we record our services that's why we do everything we do we are trying to create an atmosphere because I could take to invite a sinner it does not be like the Pharisees for this Fellowship is that we will have a heart that Christ Jesus had Christopher Arena a heart of knowing that he was a sinner's friend and that for him he was always attracting Sinners it's not the power of Jesus Christ let me tell you give this message foreign Christmas foreign foreign this is unlike all the other denominations of Pentecostal denominations we don't just come here to have church let me tell you this is a message of Grace and this message has power to change that's the reason why we are preaching and that's why we preach it so emotional but she calls it it means so much to us hallelujah amen I don't care bring me a sinner here the violence for some little time and let me preach to them this message without even Chicago it's not even about the preachers when we get that mind what if an Ender will say the mind which was in Jesus Christ oh you will not even take a Sunday without coming with somebody and you not judge those people before you bring them don't do this you will not do that foreign as it was in Christ what's the mind of Christ we are at the Sinners bring them together [Music] today everybody that's the mind of Christ why why because he knew let me be with the sinner for one minute let the sinner come around I will show you what I jesus can do hallelujah amen praise the name of Allah this message made you throw away the things you threw ourselves how many how many women here we are wearing trousers [Music] how many here we are using makeup yes look around tell me you don't even assume to testify what happened the power of the world hallelujah amen if God did it for you you can do it for somebody else if Jesus is coming today yes he will not be happy with us if our some of the chairs are empty when where you live where you walk around no work a place hallelujah amen the first time I heard this message but this praise the name of the Lord foreign Don't Preach to condemn problem and I'll show you examples here of Our Lord you know I used to be in a church somewhere where there was a a brother preaching another this is the mindset of many people who believe the message because of the way it has been presented you know and you know whenever you would see a woman coming in wearing a trousers that's not the kind of gospel we do not preach to condemn we preach to save and listen if when we preach they don't get changed then we are not preaching to begin with do you understand what I'm talking about if when we preach they don't get changed then what we are preaching is not the word and if what we preach is forcing them to change can make them do things we have not preached the word foreign you've been eating things but actually God is looking at your house that's what I'm saying number if we preach Everlasting effects [Music] because why do I preach to you because when that morning of the Rapture comes [Music] sister about our society it's about a Rapture if the Lord a very good sister dressing very well oh everybody says and we have many of such young ladies in charge that claim to preach this message very well dressed [Music] guys we have such me younger men there their hearts have never changed listen to me this message if we feed on it listen we have the bible let us read it let us feed our need to GDA we have the message let us listen don't you worry about what you have right around you get the fire of your inner worry just feed on that one there is power in that world and make you what you never thought you would be good I mean this is what we need because Jesus is a sinner's friend Jesus is your friend this morning Hallelujah and then you have a lot of young people living so immorally if God was to put a camera there a screen and put a second life of everybody there [Music] I wonder how many would sit here comfortably if you feel you might be comfortable it's time for you to make a decision are you going to continue being a Pharisees or are you going to have the heart of Christ therefore disease we are quick to condemn others [Music] but they themselves [Music] I remember and I always gave this testimony I was with my wife and this year already came you know somebody told us oh I'm going to bring this woman you know she will believe this the message actually that is the day my mindset changed as he was talking about I was seeing a very well dressed but as I was in my room with my wife with this brother no no she walked in as soon as I looked at her [Music] I started the Judgment Trends now he even wasted my time how can he bring me a prostitute these messages for people who are somewhere at least if they are like maybe Pentecost or something they just you know preach to them and then they believe I don't believe that anymore because I believe this this is not to do to help us to personalize easily um put them from their Church to our church but for somebody who is drinking or smoking a prostitute kind of science [Music] you're powerless is this message is it Christopher can you change does it have power it has power foreign foreign oh I don't know what my wife thoughts but in a moment maybe in a moment she disappeared into the bathroom I realized she was praying the whole time I don't know what she was praying but maybe she was praying oh God this is big or whatever she went to pray and why because it was one room you know and so and then I I was very bit of preaching to us but I was even preaching fearing now whatever I will talk about she will think I'm attacking her guys so I was just trying to pick a little here and then she realized what I was trying to do she stopped me oh I love that sister she changed my mindset forever yeah I've been praying the whole night I looked at her from head to toe foreign amen foreign [Music] [Music] it it had gone disappeared [Music] you know what um she came back with a very big gown something to make it fitter I don't I have never owned a cat in my life or as a dress [Music] I had to borrow this is yeah we had to shop for her because she said I've given I've I've thrown all everything that I have yeah and I watched God transform my life go Transformers and because of that one woman because of that one um the whole country of Ethiopia has received the message I mean Jesus Christ yes Crystal he's a sinner's friend praise the name of Allah and I'll go for 20 more minutes Hallelujah I mean my entire mindset changed and those from that day as long as somebody had a desire to hear [Music] um I said I'll always give my entire life and I will not give up on them because of Christ did not give up on me and brother says if there ever was a time that we needed every one of you about the witch said right now you need me and I need you God needs both of us let's train our hearts and efforts together [Music] you know have a heart of God [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] this is your Prophet saying this is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] let me tell you when I come to the message one thing that attracted me sometimes new people come around here around to have a pill remove and I watch Believers and I Marvel named you find brothers and sisters and talking to one another because they know one another [Music] and they leave the new people to stand there standing down we need to have the heart of God when you see a new younger sister a new younger brother don't wait for the pastor to go to them sister Brothers [Applause] not what they have if they're the seed of God they need it praise praise the name of God what they have they need it what we have they needed his unfailing words of Promise he says the word always corrects the era [Music] how many Believers the word always correct [Applause] shot shots but I I had one brother pushing and ready to court somewhere I will not do it again in the supermarkets [Music] you know they're like many legs are like iron Buzz so you take your eye on the bus in a shot you know I didn't know it was wrong until I had it in the message and many of you have heard many things that you didn't know were wrong [Music] you do not need to do that because the word corrects as a child of God you will be corrected the word always and if people could only see it today so sometimes you may even want to correct somebody or you cannot back home even before you bring them to the church you have to dress the way we address again don't worry are this my words why would you come to church alone meet somebody on Saturday appoint them foreign hallelujah hallelujah the time of the hour now we know these things are true so no matter how great the era might seem to be yeah the word always corrects praise the name of the Lord hallelujah how many love the Lord let me tell you if this mind is in us God is going to do exploits with us with you again you young ladies see God wants to do exploits with us but this will not work if you don't have that mind you and that I met several scriptures I wanted to show you here on how Christ was a sinner's friend but I'll read one and then I'll leave the two or three for another service and one of the verses desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of the ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them behind uh wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment now where the Pharisee which had Biden him saw it he spoke with within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches her for she is a sinner and and Jesus answering say that to him Simon I have somewhere to say unto thee and and he said unto the master say on there was a certain creditor which had to date us the one owed 500 Pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgive them both tell me the offer which of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgive most and he said unto him thou has rightfully judged and he turned to the woman and he said unto Simon Says now this woman I entered into the house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of my head God gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this Uber The Sinner has anointed my faith with ointment wherever I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved the match but to whom little Is Forgiven the same life is really tall and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said unto the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace Amina praise the name of the Lord now you have heard the scripture I believe it's about today [Music] Simon was a foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] many of such Miracles husband among the heavens people whoever believes there is something about us [Music] Simon thought I don't need this Jesus as much but I will not shower his feet I will not clean his face because I don't really need him to be safe the man did not realize that you did not realize that they needed this Jesus because he realized he didn't have a lot of and she started to immediately she didn't even talk with Jesus the person knew she was the name of the Lord I mean there's another one here but this woman then came immediately she came right to the feet of Jesus was washing the feet of Jesus to clean it and this woman the Pharisee um the one who knew he did not have a lot of sins [Music] he looked at Jesus this is not in order and you know Jesus Simon was not talking it was in his heart God knows our hearts our thoughts [Music] and Jesus looked at her and he said Simon I want to teach you something so there was a man said who had two people that were his debtors and one of the of them owed him 500 Pence and he said they were all not having enough to pay now before we continue this Simon Simon looked at Jesus foreign Simon looked at Jesus and he said what I wish he knew what type of woman this woman is a sinner was he right yes he was right that's true the truth it is true but he thought Jesus did not know did he know yes all right now cut and Jesus when he goes to teach time yes let me give you this story Simon yeah who had two creditors who do you think that woman was foreign [Music] and at that moment he said he said to her the man the people couldn't pay um and he forgive them both and they said what do you think he was more grateful yeah and and Simon says the one who was forgiving man and Jesus told him a lesson here he says you have right here [Music] [Music] foreign you did not kiss me telling you again but this woman has been kissing me since I came here foreign [Music] are forgiven foreign [Music] foreign foreign and he's right Adam because so many of the Believers they are like this Pharisees who feel the righteous they don't need to worship Allah and that's why when you go among the Pentecostals but they have praise um why but because they know they're like this woman [Music] but may God help us we may never ever feel like this Simon today I don't want to be in the place and position of Simon I want to be in the place of this woman hallelujah amen where I know I am a sinner I eat in the morning and Jesus Is My Friend where I know I have my Liberty to shed my tears and wash Jesus you are not ashamed to put your glory down this woman put her head down but some of you are so holy I'm so smart foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] and she cried and he cried foreign hallelujah hallelujah I realized there is a lot more that I can talk about than I wanted to be engineering I need to get this and let it let it suck in you know and I'll I'll continue the Lord willing on Wednesday if you you cannot be here please stream the service please foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign
