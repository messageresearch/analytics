it that's how you will find it yes amina chapter 22. and i'm going to speak on something uh it will be like uh a continuation of the previous services i was speaking on the beta who maybe are going to hear me speaking for the first time you you may just want to be patient and see how the lord will speak to you verse we are beginning to read from verse six we shall read until verse 11. let us pray before we read god our loving jesus yes you are fatwa i am just standing before the purchase of your blessings take it for granted [Music] because i know that these people are yours [Music] to speak according to the inspiration which you have given to me and even to those that are listening to me nervous all right and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophet sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done and i will check it verse by verse so you have to read side by side with me i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book yes amen i mean and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these [Music] for which you know that john is a type of the rather he fell down and worshipped ya go and see have namaste but what did the angel speak to him then saith here unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god [Music] we are worshipping god to see zakat honda but brother branham was a prophet in this generation and a prophet is an angel which god uses in a generational [Music] of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand [Music] let him be and just steal and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still oh the communion are you known i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last name m praise the lord i mean jesus is the alpha and omega yes there is no other malala there is no other god come around some sort of tool and see this uh i'm happy to see this young man joel i've been sharing with him okay well so to those who do not want to go deep into the world and you know you may not enjoy it but to those who love the word i'm sure you will enjoy you say you may not know somebody but let them tell you the word then they will become your friends [Music] [Music] [Music] blessed is he that keeping the sayings of the prophecy of this book and we notice that the bible in the book of revelation speaks about a book which was [Music] that was going to be redeemed was on that book so this is a book of redemption right away i'll give you a short quote here brother if you can find it for me it says in the message the city shall not be here with a shark i'll read several quotes and several scriptures this morning that's why the rapture the bride the wise virgin they called out not all christians are going in the rapture when i say christians i mean those who claim to believe on jesus christ everyone is going guess what i believe in a million [Music] you businessman wouldn't run your office like some uh people try to think that god runs his program [Applause] [Music] jesus did not come to create people who will be saved yes jesus did not come to make us yes you collected jesus came to seek yes amen remember the shepherd seeks for the lost [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] no that's why you recognize that you you recognize that that he knows you know what she take it into aquaman in them you recognize this watch yes i mean hallelujah amen stick with this then it will be all fine amen he said then as i have said many times you recognize that [Music] [Music] [Music] what about the preachers where organizations when you realize who you are [Music] um and they all came from those movements unless otherwise i don't expect to be long maybe one hour max man and i saw maybe i'll have to take this on again and again and again as lord leaders and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is rather to open the book and to lose the seals thereof [Music] the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals and when i turned to see in the midst of the throne of the phobists and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth okay now i want you to um i know we have read this many times and i want i want you to uh consider the lamb in this [Music] you see when the voice spoke to john and told him that the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed in was not slain that day oh man that lamb was slain before the foundation of the world i mean and so this was the lamb that was worthy oh no well you might win the lamb is the lion oh man [Music] god became oh was inspired this part of the summer was inspired by the polycarp he asked me this question and this is a quarter he sent to me so i'm going to read it to you guys so you need to listen to every word it is just amazing it says now the mystery of the book are revealed again [Music] are you listening are you a listening child my name is and when the seals completely are broken the time of redemption is over notice he said when the seals are completely broken the time of redemption is over okay listen because the lamb left the intercession post to work out to his claims there are different things here we'll talk about it i mean he was a mediator between that [Music] but when the re-revelation happens on the seals as they begin to pray he took the book the apartheid so it's no more media cutting because even they called him a lion and that's the king and he's not a mediator then now there are three phases or three parts within of the breaking of this seal while it or maybe trying to be certain one so it happens from what we read here one way to vote summer revelation five oh could become what happened it was it was broken when the lamb which was already slain oman but that wasn't seen in symbol form younger believers when they begin to hear the word sealed standards they begin to okay pastor i'll be here the next service so please i wanted to open your house this is the food for believers [Music] amen they are again broken to brother branham by revelation and you and i know that brother bannon preached on this revelation of the seven seals and he took it one seal by one by one by one all the seven seals but when you read actually i was shown it by a brother that was amazed which he recorded [Music] of the mystery but you can see but and so it was all revealed in our time but that book follow me now here the lamb took the book so he has to literally come but before the rapture happens we are in the process of the claiming of the book let me let me bring it this way continuously when the lamb died on the cross oh man we have masala he paid it all [Music] jesus paid it oh yes [Music] [Music] which is claiming any there is no claim on it there is no crime on it but then the complete phase of the claiming now i want us to look at this part where it says that uh the comp the seals are broken and when the seals completely are broken the time of redemption is overlapping with people know that brother bannon preached on the revelation of the seven seals there are some groups which preach and say there is no more massive [Music] you sang a very good song speak my lord speak send me out in the field because we believe commander took it jesus is still in the massachusetts and he is still saving the sinners [Music] maybe for the sake of the brethren that uh have just joined us let's just open revelation 10. comey [Music] all right let us go back again to verse one read from that let us read from boston and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven close with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire nine and remember this is the same one that did the work of redemption is a confident angel yeah and who is it it is none other than our lord jesus christ his and when he had he cried seven thunders out of their voices their voices i was about to write and and i had a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven that i found as other than write them now everywhere to come together amen follow me here now notice that the angel tells john malaysia to seal up the things that the seven thunders have happened and he was told [Applause] talking about the end of the ceiling of these things when the time comes the fullness of time comes thunders attack everywhere to come somewhere don't write it down obviously but then we see what does it say on verse six and i swear by him and leave it forever and ever who killed heaven and earth and the thing that they are in ah and the things that um and the earth and the feel that they are in our and the sea and the things which are there are in and and that there should be time no longer the time of of the voice of the seventh that's why this fellowship is called days of the yes [Applause] is the hearts of the children mysteries the book is no [Music] amen that the trinity doctrine is not a biblical doctrine how can you tell me that father is god son is god holy spirit is god but father is not the father the son and son is not the holy spirit all right europe and they agree to make one goal how many gods are they that's so frustrating we yes sure he asked phillip now is that philippians don't know me and the philippines said show us the facts what [Music] [Music] yes you have seen me oh lovers you have seen the fire are your cheaper faith don't look no more but their eyes was blinded i told them before oh [Music] revelation chapter one two and three talks about the seven stars which were in the right hand of him [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] you mean that all the other denominations don't have christ they don't know him jesus was with the pharisees yes you didn't have a father's child the father [Music] it starts with the breaking of the silence the uh revelation of the standards of god silence was broken [Applause] [Music] it means the whole time i think it is to say that you're not finishing of the redemption the finishing of the world of redemption which finishes with him redeeming all the gentiles and also redeeming all the jews he was supposed to reduce praise the name of the lord i'm an adversary now the claiming of the book amen does not begin with claiming they're claiming you cannot just simply walk at a shop and tell them give [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Applause] you see this work of claiming begins with purchasing [Music] we are supposed to have dominion over poverty over sickness over suffering oh where is [Applause] and that is why adam stop being in control it looks like the world is the one taking us here oh and sometimes [Music] the dominion was purchased [Applause] and now we're talking about exclaiming amen

me again [Music] [Music] it's like you were born in prison and in chains when someone comes and tells you you know what you're doing you're not a prisoner because [Music] oh amen and the revealing of it is part of the claim yes but the claiming of this book ends in a very big event i don't want to put any even it's a process but really it happened it ends up being uneven from glory i believe what the bible says they shall rise in china cannot hold you no more no need that why watch it because you are a badges hallelujah [Applause] sadness i don't care the bible says i believe those who are alive and remain shall be caught what is that him hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Applause] is how it says in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed when he's in his meditatory mediatory work back there redeeming him but someday he comes forth again to get this book that he has redeemed and he says and all that is in the book would be him me here he says for that is the believer again the book is what the book is describing the book amen and he says for that okay let's go back in in the beginning so you don't miss it because if you miss it everybody will miss it all right let us go
