[49:19] Uh we are reading uh Colossians chapter
[49:22] 2
[49:24] 8 to 12.

[50:16] philosophy and vain deceit, after the

[50:37] without hands, in putting off the body
[50:40] of the sins of the flesh, by the
[50:42] circumcision of Christ, buried with him

[52:38] underline some of these verses and write
[52:41] some inspiration.

[53:04] If ye continue in the faith grounded and
[53:07] settled, and be not moved away from the
[53:09] hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,
[53:12] and which was pre uh preached to every
[53:15] creature, which is under heaven, whereof
[53:18] I, Paul, are made a minister,
[53:44] Yes, just just follow this verse 24.
[53:46] says, "Who now rejoice
[53:49] in my sufferings for you and fill up
[53:52] that which is behind of the afflictions
[53:55] of Christ in my flesh for his body's
[53:58] sake, which is the church.
[54:14] whereof I am made a minister according
[54:17] to the dispensation of God which is
[54:19] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[54:22] of God.
[54:28] [Music]
[54:35] And then I'm going to read this
[54:37] together.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Um, from 26 all the way to 29. Listen.
[54:43] Even the mystery which has been heed
[54:45] from ages and from generations, but now
[54:47] is made manifest to his saints, to whom
[54:50] God would make known what is the riches
[54:52] of the glory of this mystery among the
[54:53] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[54:56] hope of glory, whom we preach, warning
[54:59] every man, and teaching every man in all
[55:02] wisdom, that we may present every man
[55:04] perfect in Christ Jesus, where unto I
[55:08] also labor, striving to his working,
[55:12] which workketh in me mighty.
[55:16] Okay.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Read verses 26 to 29.
[55:40] Crystal
[55:58] [Music]
[56:00] Moonche.
[56:02] Amen. Ask your neighbor, are you ready
[56:04] for the word?
[56:08] &gt;&gt; All right. I believe everybody said
[56:09] they're ready. So, see uh uh if you
[56:14] notice how Apostle Paul writes to the
[56:16] Colossians,
[56:21] he is mainly uh dealing with the
[56:23] preeminence of of Christ in his church.
[56:32] like like he's trying to present himself
[56:35] as a a servant.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. He says, "I I was made a minister.
[56:42] I made a minister."
[56:45] And and then he shows it, but it has
[56:47] nothing to do with him,
[56:50] but it has everything to do with Christ.
[56:54] And then he says that Christ is the
[56:56] fullness of the of of the godhead bodly.
[57:02] And then you know he begins to talk
[57:05] about the mystery of God.
[57:09] And he says you see this mystery has
[57:11] been hidden or hid from ages
[57:15] and from generations
[57:17] but now he's saying now to his saints it
[57:20] has been made manifest.
[57:26] to the saints. He will make known
[57:30] what is the riches
[57:33] of the glory of this mystery.
[57:38] And he says this mystery is Christ in
[57:41] you.
[57:44] Tell your neighbor Christ in you.
[57:48] Amen.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; It's all about Christ, friends.
[57:54] It's all about Christ.
[57:56] So when we talk about you, we're not
[57:58] talking about you. We're talking about
[57:59] Christ in you.
[58:04] You know Christ is God.
[58:07] Christ is the fullness of Godhead. But
[58:12] even Jesus said that without him I am
[58:14] nothing.
[58:17] So how about you? Without him what are
[58:20] you?
[58:22] So without him we are nothing.
[58:25] Praise the name of the Lord. And Apostle
[58:28] Paul is very careful here
[58:30] as he's writing to the Colossians
[58:33] to tell him we are preaching our
[58:35] preaching is all about Christ.
[58:39] He says whom we preach.
[58:42] You see, warning every man and teaching
[58:46] every man in all wisdom
[58:48] that we may present every man perfect in
[58:53] Christ Jesus.
[58:57] So our perfection is not in us.
[59:01] Our perfection is in Christ.
[59:05] So the only way we can be made perfect
[59:07] is if we are in Christ.
[59:12] And then you know he continues on
[59:16] on chapter two to warn and to say
[59:20] therefore let let's um beware
[59:25] be careful. He says, "Watch
[59:28] that let any lest any man spoil you
[59:31] through philosophy,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; through uh vain deceit,
[59:40] after the traditions of men,
[59:45] after the rudiments of the world,
[59:48] [Music]
[59:50] and not after Christ."
[59:53] There's another portion where he says
[59:55] that Satan himself
[59:59] made himself the angel of light
[1:00:04] and he has made his ministers
[1:00:07] ministers of righteousness.
[1:00:11] So today we have preachers
[1:00:14] who are hired by Satan.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Can you can you believe it?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Who are hired by Satan.
[1:00:22] who are preaching on behalf of Satan,
[1:00:26] but they are actually leading people to
[1:00:29] hell.
[1:00:32] And the only way you can be able to know
[1:00:35] is by what Paul is saying in Colossians
[1:00:38] 2:8.
[1:00:40] He says, "Beware,
[1:00:42] lest any man spoil you."
[1:00:46] Now, now in another place it says,
[1:00:48] "These are men
[1:00:51] who crept among us.
[1:00:55] They crept in unawares."
[1:00:59] And so, and then they they have become
[1:01:01] preachers of righteousness.
[1:01:05] But what are they preaching?
[1:01:08] What are they doing with the ministry?
[1:01:12] How you know them is that they do not
[1:01:15] point you to Christ.
[1:01:19] They do not lead the church to Christ,
[1:01:22] but they lead you to themselves
[1:01:26] and their leader,
[1:01:29] Satan.
[1:01:31] How? Through philosophy,
[1:01:34] through vain deceit,
[1:01:37] through tradition of men and good men of
[1:01:39] the world.
[1:01:41] But every God orained man,
[1:01:46] every God called man
[1:01:49] will lead you to Christ,
[1:01:52] will preach you to Christ,
[1:01:54] will introduce you to Christ.
[1:01:57] Amen. That was the purpose of him taking
[1:02:01] the book.
[1:02:02] Praise the name of the Lord. There is a
[1:02:05] difference of opening the book and
[1:02:08] revealing the book.
[1:02:15] Are you following me, child? So, there's
[1:02:18] only one that was worthy to take the
[1:02:22] book and to open it, to lose the seal.
[1:02:27] There was no man that was worthy.
[1:02:30] There was no angel that was worthy.
[1:02:33] There was no one but Christ.
[1:02:37] He alone is one and we sing this in many
[1:02:41] songs. He alone is one to receive glory
[1:02:45] and honor and adoration forever and
[1:02:48] ever. Amen.
[1:02:50] No one else who can stand against.
[1:02:55] No one can, no one will.
[1:02:58] And he alone is worthy.
[1:03:01] There's no prophet that was worthy.
[1:03:04] But you see the prophet comes later
[1:03:10] as the revealer of the mysteries
[1:03:14] that are already open.
[1:03:19] So some people thought that brother Bam
[1:03:20] opened.
[1:03:26] Well that makes him Christ.
[1:03:29] That makes him our redeemer.
[1:03:32] But he is not like Apostle Paul. His
[1:03:36] work was to introduce you and lead you
[1:03:38] to Christ.
[1:03:42] So this message is not brother Brham
[1:03:46] Brother. I expected an amen there.
[1:03:51] This message is not our church.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Is not any denomination.
[1:03:58] This message
[1:04:00] is Christ. Actually, brother himself
[1:04:03] says the message is Christ.
[1:04:08] That's what it's all about.
[1:04:11] And anything done, anything said that is
[1:04:15] not about Christ,
[1:04:18] then we are being misled.
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:24] So he gives us those things. He says
[1:04:27] philosophy.
[1:04:30] This man will spoil you through
[1:04:32] philosophy.
[1:04:34] Philosophy. What is philosophy?
[1:04:36] Philosophy. Philosophy is credle.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; In Latin it is called credored
[1:04:44] or creed.
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:48] set of beliefs,
[1:04:56] thinking,
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; ideas,
[1:05:01] understandings,
[1:05:04] you know that a man will have
[1:05:07] but it is not Christ
[1:05:10] and that's why we have many
[1:05:11] denominations
[1:05:13] because all the denominations
[1:05:15] have their philophies on God.
[1:05:21] Every religion has their own philosophy.
[1:05:26] They have their own creeds.
[1:05:28] They have their own thinking,
[1:05:30] ideologies, beliefs,
[1:05:33] set of ideas.
[1:05:36] But this message,
[1:05:39] we do not have any creed.
[1:05:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have a church
[1:05:46] manual.
[1:05:48] That is why we don't have a church menu.
[1:05:53] We are not going to get a church menu
[1:05:56] because our creed is Christ.
[1:06:00] No creed but Christ.
[1:06:03] No membership but fellowship.
[1:06:06] No law but love.
[1:06:08] Are you following me now?
[1:06:10] But you see these men will spoil you
[1:06:14] through their creeds
[1:06:17] and they will hire teachers,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; preachers,
[1:06:23] disciples,
[1:06:25] but they will teach.
[1:06:28] They will cultivate.
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:33] They will cultivate in them
[1:06:39] that these people may be able to dis to
[1:06:42] to to like disseminate it.
[1:06:48] No, you didn't get it.
[1:06:50] These systems,
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; what we what we are dealing with here is
[1:06:55] one of the major things. And so I want
[1:06:57] you to quickly get in the spirit.
[1:06:58] Brother,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; listen. These systems
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; what they do
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; they they they cultivate these people
[1:07:06] disciples
[1:07:11] they get their own disciples.
[1:07:14] All right.
[1:07:18] And after they disciple them.
[1:07:22] You know what they do? They cultivate
[1:07:23] them.
[1:07:26] There is a better word for cultivation.
[1:07:33] They cultivate them to become diards
[1:07:38] of their system
[1:07:40] of their idea
[1:07:43] whereby these will be the main
[1:07:45] disciples,
[1:07:48] their system. Then now they send them
[1:07:51] out
[1:07:53] and go and disseminate what they have
[1:07:55] cultivated them
[1:08:02] to see it clearly. You'll understand it
[1:08:05] by what you you saw the uh the today we
[1:08:08] have some systems that do that.
[1:08:12] Every denomination does
[1:08:16] but the ones who have done it so well
[1:08:18] had the Roman Catholic
[1:08:24] you cannot get married
[1:08:26] we will take care of you we do
[1:08:28] everything for you come we cultivate you
[1:08:33] when we put our system in you
[1:08:36] then now you go out and disseminate for
[1:08:40] life.
[1:08:42] No matter what you do, these men can die
[1:08:45] for their ideas.
[1:08:48] They can die for their cre
[1:08:51] they will be spies and you never know.
[1:08:54] In one of our churches here, there was a
[1:08:57] church.
[1:08:58] One infiltrated even
[1:09:01] we did not know who he was. He came in
[1:09:04] as a as someone who has received the
[1:09:06] message
[1:09:08] and and we supported him with funds and
[1:09:11] everything all over the world. A
[1:09:14] reverend father has been living
[1:09:17] and he was in in in the message trying
[1:09:24] the message operates.
[1:09:27] So they want to understand because they
[1:09:28] don't we don't have any system of
[1:09:33] we don't have a headquarter
[1:09:35] you know if there if if it is hard there
[1:09:38] is one thing that is hard is to destroy
[1:09:40] an unorganized movement
[1:09:47] if something is organized
[1:09:50] you destroy from the top
[1:09:54] and it will just be
[1:09:56] But when it is not organized,
[1:10:00] there is no headquarter. There is no
[1:10:02] headman
[1:10:04] you know. But the truth is everywhere.
[1:10:07] So they are having a headache.
[1:10:10] They can't understand
[1:10:13] who we are, what we are standing for,
[1:10:16] how they can destroy us.
[1:10:18] So they they begin to send in spies.
[1:10:24] And this man came in
[1:10:25] Many of you know who I'm talking about.
[1:10:28] He came in for months and months. He he
[1:10:32] tried to, you know, come in and clean
[1:10:35] everywhere.
[1:10:37] Get to know everybody. Get to know how
[1:10:39] the chain moves.
[1:10:41] And by the time they found out who he
[1:10:43] was, oh my goodness, the damage he had
[1:10:47] caused,
[1:10:48] the damage he had caused,
[1:10:52] the the the the girls he had raped.
[1:10:55] The girls he had fornicated
[1:10:59] he had destroyed
[1:11:04] supposed to be a priest.
[1:11:08] What am I talking about?
[1:11:10] By the time he left,
[1:11:13] he confessed
[1:11:16] that he actually knows the message isn't
[1:11:20] truth.
[1:11:24] And we are able to know who he was
[1:11:28] because he confessed.
[1:11:31] But he must have realized
[1:11:33] he cannot destroy the message.
[1:11:37] No one can destroy the message. If you
[1:11:39] destroy me, you don't know what you're
[1:11:42] doing. The millions like me
[1:11:47] and they are not even connected with me.
[1:11:51] Amen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; So you can't destroy us all.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; You see something we saw was the false
[1:12:03] vine cannot destroy the true vine.
[1:12:09] They cannot destroy us
[1:12:12] because we are not standing for any
[1:12:14] creed.
[1:12:17] We do not have any church manual.
[1:12:21] We are not an organization
[1:12:24] but we our creed is Christ
[1:12:31] and to destroy us
[1:12:34] how to destroy Christ.
[1:12:37] But you cannot destroy Christ.
[1:12:40] He is the center of our faith.
[1:12:44] He is the center of our being.
[1:12:48] Hallelujah.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And that's why the devil knows that
[1:12:54] he knows he can destroy a group.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; So you will try to come and destroy
[1:13:00] individuals
[1:13:05] come to you, come to the other. Come to
[1:13:07] the other and try to silence the voices
[1:13:12] that are standing for the word.
[1:13:15] Try to bring perversion.
[1:13:17] into false doctrine.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; And then when one man who was standing
[1:13:25] for the word
[1:13:28] goes into false doctrine,
[1:13:30] the devil thinks have finished them
[1:13:33] but he doesn't understand. He cannot
[1:13:35] finish us. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. When
[1:13:40] one of us go into the first story,
[1:13:43] the church moves on.
[1:13:46] Hallelujah.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it tries to strike them with
[1:13:48] sin
[1:13:51] and tries to silence those.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, friends, the church
[1:13:56] of Christ
[1:13:58] has a prophecy on its head
[1:14:03] and the prophecy is the hell
[1:14:08] over it.
[1:14:12] Hallelujah. So you see these men. They
[1:14:16] come to spoil the church.
[1:14:18] How do they come? They come with
[1:14:21] philosophy,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; with a set of creeds,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; with church manuals.
[1:14:29] Amen. I'm so glad we don't have a church
[1:14:32] manual.
[1:14:35] We will never have a church.
[1:14:38] We cannot have a church. Our church
[1:14:42] manual is the revival.
[1:14:49] He will come with vain deceit.
[1:14:53] He will come with tradition of men.
[1:14:57] Instead of teaching the word people will
[1:15:00] be glued to tradition.
[1:15:03] And I talked about that so much on
[1:15:05] Sunday
[1:15:07] with the rudiments of the world
[1:15:10] for Christ. I want you to know
[1:15:13] wants to have preeminence in his church.
[1:15:18] And for him to have preeminence in his
[1:15:20] church.
[1:15:22] Amen. He will do that by the word and
[1:15:24] the spirit.
[1:15:28] The word and the spirit.
[1:15:30] The word and the spirit are one.
[1:15:35] Amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Follow me closely. If someone claims to
[1:15:38] believe the word,
[1:15:40] but then they reject the Holy Spirit,
[1:15:44] it shows they did not believe to begin.
[1:15:49] Yes. Can you say amen to that? If
[1:15:52] someone claims to have the spirit,
[1:15:55] but then they they they reject the word,
[1:15:59] it shows they never received the word.
[1:16:03] They never received the spirit to begin
[1:16:05] with.
[1:16:07] Someone has the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:10] Amen. They will always receive the word.
[1:16:15] I don't care their denomination. I don't
[1:16:17] care their religion.
[1:16:20] And be baptized in the water.
[1:16:23] They will always receive the word.
[1:16:26] anything short of this
[1:16:30] it only creates philosophy vendit
[1:16:33] tradition
[1:16:39] follow me closely
[1:16:41] philosophy
[1:16:45] tradition of men
[1:16:48] these things are the breeding grounds
[1:16:52] for cults
[1:16:58] Okay. So, I want us to deal with
[1:17:00] something today.
[1:17:03] I have a question for you. What is a
[1:17:06] cult?
[1:17:09] A cult can refer to a group with an
[1:17:12] unusual or often extreme religious,
[1:17:15] spiritual or philosophical belief
[1:17:17] system.
[1:17:27] They are often with a charismatic leader
[1:17:30] who exerts significant control over the
[1:17:33] members.
[1:17:40] Alternatively,
[1:17:42] it can also signify
[1:17:45] intense devotion to a person.
[1:17:52] You devote your life
[1:17:55] to a man,
[1:17:57] okay? Or to an idea
[1:18:01] or to a lifestyle.
[1:18:05] The term carries negative conotations in
[1:18:07] popular uses, often implying
[1:18:08] questionable activities or
[1:18:09] unconventional practices.
[1:18:15] So you'll find these people
[1:18:18] who are actually in a cult
[1:18:21] okay they will always they will I don't
[1:18:24] know if you find a better word for cult
[1:18:35] you always find in a cult
[1:18:38] that people are very religious
[1:18:43] they are very spiritual
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:46] extreme
[1:18:48] philosophical.
[1:18:53] But behind all that
[1:18:57] there is a man
[1:19:00] and you will find that if they will say
[1:19:04] if our man has not said it
[1:19:09] if it is true if it is false we will not
[1:19:13] be.
[1:19:16] So they are not interested in the truth
[1:19:20] but they are interested in what their
[1:19:22] man has said.
[1:19:26] Their alleiance
[1:19:30] is with a man
[1:19:33] with a system
[1:19:35] and not Christ
[1:19:38] not the word.
[1:19:41] Hallelujah. Now you know what is
[1:19:46] Oh, we see that everywhere.
[1:19:49] It doesn't matter. By the way, it
[1:19:50] doesn't matter what they believe.
[1:19:55] They may even be claiming to believe the
[1:19:57] message
[1:20:01] and they are a
[1:20:03] how but if they put all their allegiance
[1:20:10] they put it to a man
[1:20:13] they put it to their church
[1:20:16] to their system
[1:20:20] and not after
[1:20:25] If you want to know who they are,
[1:20:28] talk against their man.
[1:20:33] They can even hit you physically
[1:20:38] because their allegiance is with a man.
[1:20:45] That's how killed those people.
[1:20:50] They were in a cultivated
[1:20:55] them.
[1:20:59] A cult is a place where people are
[1:21:02] cultivated
[1:21:03] to believe in a man, a system or an
[1:21:06] idea.
[1:21:13] Are you following me now? Such they
[1:21:17] believed in him.
[1:21:20] They did not have any regard for the
[1:21:22] word of God.
[1:21:25] They believed the man.
[1:21:27] Tell us anything we shall do it.
[1:21:32] You know, until you lose your mind
[1:21:35] and that man's mind is your mind.
[1:21:42] And he told them, "Sell everything.
[1:21:45] Give me the money. I'm taking it to
[1:21:48] heaven. They said, "All right." They
[1:21:50] sold everything. They gave him the
[1:21:53] money. He packed them in a house.
[1:21:57] He He disappeared through a tunnel.
[1:22:01] And you know, he saw they saw him. They
[1:22:04] saw him shutting the doors.
[1:22:09] They saw him nailing the doors.
[1:22:13] You know remember they are cultivated to
[1:22:15] believe that this man is the one only
[1:22:18] the one man
[1:22:27] I don't know how he deceived them but he
[1:22:29] told them now we don't want like this is
[1:22:32] like Noah's ark
[1:22:35] the doors are being shut
[1:22:38] when the rapture is happening
[1:22:40] the ones who are on the
[1:22:42] will miss
[1:22:44] and these are not younger children,
[1:22:48] they're young and old,
[1:22:50] rich and poor. Anyone can be can be to
[1:22:54] be a part of a
[1:23:03] burnt alive.
[1:23:07] No one could escape. They believed in
[1:23:09] the man
[1:23:11] more than the world.
[1:23:14] Oh, their minds were spoiled.
[1:23:19] Instead of being after Christ,
[1:23:23] he was after vain deceit and philosophy
[1:23:26] and tradition of men.
[1:23:33] Even today in our country,
[1:23:36] Amen. We have a lot of cowards.
[1:23:40] I don't care what they believe,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; but we have a lot of courage.
[1:23:45] I wish I had the liberty to mention
[1:23:47] names.
[1:23:50] I cannot.
[1:23:54] But you see, if the spirit of God is in
[1:23:56] you,
[1:23:58] when we are done with it,
[1:24:01] you will you will do what Apostle Paul
[1:24:03] told us. You will be aware.
[1:24:09] You find you talk about their leader
[1:24:15] a person who was humble, nice and
[1:24:17] loving,
[1:24:19] they become like a devil,
[1:24:23] he will tell them I am speaking about
[1:24:26] the word.
[1:24:29] And if you're preacher, if you're
[1:24:32] apostle, if
[1:24:34] you're a bishop, is something contrary
[1:24:37] to the word
[1:24:41] is a false preacher
[1:24:48] and they will hear what you're
[1:24:49] preaching.
[1:24:51] They will see it is in the word
[1:24:54] because their bishop, their pastor,
[1:24:56] their pastor believes it differently.
[1:25:02] They will not follow you.
[1:25:04] They will take what their bishop had.
[1:25:11] That is a cult.
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:17] What did brother teach?
[1:25:20] He said, and I'm just calling for him.
[1:25:23] He said, "If I say anything
[1:25:28] is not in the word,
[1:25:30] leave it alone.
[1:25:33] Amen.
[1:25:36] The Bible as the absolute
[1:25:43] said I preach what Paul preached.
[1:25:48] He said my words don't amount to
[1:25:50] anything.
[1:25:53] If it doesn't agree with the Bible
[1:25:57] leave it alone. You see, he gave the
[1:26:00] believers
[1:26:02] the understanding.
[1:26:04] This is not about me as
[1:26:09] Christ.
[1:26:12] Hallelujah.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, people came up one time
[1:26:16] because they saw the miracles, the
[1:26:18] power, the manifestation
[1:26:21] in the ministry
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; and they came.
[1:26:26] It has been revealed to us.
[1:26:29] You are Jesus Christ.
[1:26:34] You yourself. You're Jesus himself.
[1:26:38] He said, "What?
[1:26:41] That's blasphemy.
[1:26:44] That's blasphemy.
[1:26:46] If I ever hear something like that
[1:26:48] again,
[1:26:50] I will quit the pulpit."
[1:26:53] and and the blood of the people would
[1:26:55] have been saved will be upon you.
[1:26:59] And you know this group said it has been
[1:27:02] revealed to us
[1:27:05] you should be the only one to preach
[1:27:09] and no one else.
[1:27:12] They are planning to sell their houses.
[1:27:16] They are planning to sell every thing
[1:27:18] they have
[1:27:20] so they can move to Jefferson. Okay. You
[1:27:24] told them you are mistaken.
[1:27:27] I'm just a preacher
[1:27:30] of the gospel.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; I am one of the so many
[1:27:35] around the world.
[1:27:38] And today we see that some spirit
[1:27:43] coming back in our gener
[1:27:47] saying only brother should preach
[1:27:50] and nobody else.
[1:27:52] Is this gospel about brother?
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; This gospel is about Christ.
[1:28:01] Brother was a preacher of the gospel.
[1:28:05] His work was to lead us to Christ.
[1:28:10] That is the same old spirit.
[1:28:13] It's a countish spirit.
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:18] Amen. It takes the spirit of God for you
[1:28:21] to discern it.
[1:28:26] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:28:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul preached and he said follow
[1:28:33] me as I follow Christ.
[1:28:37] So it's not about me.
[1:28:40] I am just made a minister.
[1:28:43] Say I am just a list of the apostles.
[1:28:48] So it's not about me.
[1:28:51] It is about Christ.
[1:28:53] Follow me as long as I'm following
[1:28:56] Christ.
[1:28:58] Listen the same thing by himself.
[1:29:04] Amen. Hallelujah. And I tell you what
[1:29:06] friends, if there has ever been a
[1:29:08] preacher in this world that fought
[1:29:10] against
[1:29:15] brother.
[1:29:18] So you ask a question. Are there people
[1:29:21] who are believing what brother taught
[1:29:24] and they are a cult?
[1:29:30] Oh yes, there are so many.
[1:29:34] There are so many are there people who
[1:29:37] are believing what Paul said under a
[1:29:43] so many even in the city here are there
[1:29:47] people who believe what Jesus said and
[1:29:52] yes it's not about what you believe
[1:29:56] it's about how you operate
[1:30:00] it's about who has preeminence in what
[1:30:04] you believe.
[1:30:10] Hallelujah. Preeminence
[1:30:13] should be God having preeminence
[1:30:19] in us. But even Jesus himself
[1:30:24] when he was on earth, he never pointed
[1:30:27] to himself. Can you believe it?
[1:30:32] He pointed to God.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; He humbled himself.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was found in a fashion.
[1:30:45] So in other words, every preacher, Amen,
[1:30:49] that is pointing people to Christ,
[1:30:53] Amen. will not point to himself,
[1:30:56] will not point to his organization.
[1:31:00] But you hear them.
[1:31:02] If you leave us, you are lost. If you
[1:31:07] leave us, you are not the bride. If you
[1:31:10] leave us, and you know even people who
[1:31:12] claim to believe this truth,
[1:31:15] you find them beginning to have those
[1:31:17] attitudes.
[1:31:21] And actually people can can believe it
[1:31:24] so much
[1:31:27] to an extent.
[1:31:29] that they will fear to leave a church or
[1:31:33] a system
[1:31:38] even when they need to
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; and they believe their salvation
[1:31:45] is rude to a church system.
[1:31:51] You see that's a cultish behavior.
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:56] That's right.
[1:31:58] Paul said, "Be aware
[1:32:01] lest any man
[1:32:05] spoil you
[1:32:07] through philosophy,
[1:32:10] deceit, tradition of men, rudiments of
[1:32:14] the world."
[1:32:16] So we have liberty in Christ.
[1:32:21] Amen. God wants to lead his church.
[1:32:25] He wants to be the leader.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And I know I read this quote in
[1:32:33] Ephesians church age on Sunday.
[1:32:37] In other words, take all of the
[1:32:38] sacredness and all of the power from the
[1:32:40] church and put it on the priests.
[1:32:47] Let the congregation live anywhere they
[1:32:49] want to, but the priest is the holy one.
[1:32:54] taking the Holy Ghost away from the
[1:32:55] people with signs and wonders following
[1:32:57] them and taking that away and give them
[1:32:59] the holy priesthood.
[1:33:06] Yes.
[1:33:09] Taking away the Holy Ghost and swapping
[1:33:11] it for a priesthood.
[1:33:15] You see in this church here it was it
[1:33:17] was a deeds
[1:33:19] and this place it become a doctrine.
[1:33:24] And it took over
[1:33:29] and when Luther came out, it couldn't
[1:33:32] stay that way. It went right back and
[1:33:35] took over again.
[1:33:38] Bishops, Cardinals, Archbishops,
[1:33:42] who in the world, they are the heads of
[1:33:44] the God's church. Who in the world is
[1:33:47] the head of God's church?
[1:33:52] he himself.
[1:33:54] And brother says, "Now I feel
[1:33:56] religious."
[1:33:58] The Holy Ghost was sent to rule the
[1:34:00] church,
[1:34:03] not just the preacher, the whole
[1:34:07] congregation.
[1:34:10] Oh brother, if it can come to a moment
[1:34:14] whereby Christ is having being the
[1:34:17] preeminent one in your life,
[1:34:23] You will love everybody.
[1:34:26] Even those in other fellowship,
[1:34:28] even those in the denomination, you will
[1:34:31] love them wanting to give them the
[1:34:33] truth.
[1:34:35] Hallelujah.
[1:34:37] Amen. And and I want to quote something
[1:34:40] here very significant.
[1:34:42] There's no way I can move on without
[1:34:44] quoting this
[1:34:46] in the church age book.
[1:34:48] He says, "Now,
[1:34:50] What was the spiritual climate of that
[1:34:52] church?
[1:34:55] It had left its first love.
[1:35:00] Leaving his first love of the word of
[1:35:02] God
[1:35:05] was revealed to us as having fallen from
[1:35:07] its origin
[1:35:17] and its origin was Pentecost.
[1:35:22] In a plain language,
[1:35:24] that means this church was in danger of
[1:35:27] being taken away from the leading of the
[1:35:29] Holy Spirit.
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:37] the control of the spirit.
[1:35:40] Listen church God
[1:35:44] where now they're telling you your
[1:35:47] pastor should not preach to you
[1:35:48] Wednesday night, Sunday morning
[1:35:54] because God used a prophet.
[1:35:57] So you should play his tape.
[1:36:01] And even the tape you're going to play
[1:36:02] on Sunday morning
[1:36:05] is going to be sent to you from the
[1:36:07] headquarters
[1:36:12] and the bride all over the world
[1:36:16] should be connected to that.
[1:36:22] So God leads one man at the
[1:36:23] headquarters.
[1:36:27] and then everybody else follows.
[1:36:30] The church is in a danger
[1:36:33] of being taken away
[1:36:36] from the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:36:39] But God wants to be the leader.
[1:36:43] God wants to be the ruler.
[1:36:46] God wants to be the bishop of our soul.
[1:36:50] The Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; In his bride.
[1:36:57] Hallelujah.
[1:36:59] Yes, sir.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God help us to see this.
[1:37:04] You see, this was exactly what took
[1:37:06] place after Moses led Israel out of the
[1:37:08] heaven.
[1:37:14] The way of God was to lead them by the
[1:37:16] cloud of fire.
[1:37:21] prophetic utterance,
[1:37:24] miracles,
[1:37:26] signs and wonders.
[1:37:29] This was to be accomplished.
[1:37:34] Hallelujah.
[1:37:36] Oh my my amen needs to be bigger for God
[1:37:39] to give you bigger revelation.
[1:37:43] Amen. You know what he says? The way of
[1:37:48] God
[1:37:50] was to lead them through the cloud of
[1:37:52] fire,
[1:37:55] prophetic utterance,
[1:37:57] miracles and signs, God-given wonders.
[1:38:02] And this was going to be accomplished by
[1:38:09] God selected,
[1:38:11] God ordained, and God equipped and God
[1:38:15] sent men.
[1:38:23] God selected, God, God equipped and God
[1:38:27] sent men.
[1:38:30] You believe that God today
[1:38:34] has men all over the world.
[1:38:36] Let me say this. In every country on
[1:38:39] earth, in every city on earth, in every
[1:38:43] village on earth,
[1:38:45] God has sent men. God has selected men.
[1:38:49] God has ordained men. God has equipped
[1:38:52] men. Amen. Going out to do. Amen. To
[1:38:57] bring prophetic utterance.
[1:39:01] Amen. to bring the miracle Sunday
[1:39:06] to move in the life of the church
[1:39:11] with the whole camp
[1:39:15] being dominated by a Holy Ghost move.
[1:39:21] Hallelujah.
[1:39:23] Just like DVF,
[1:39:25] God has sent us men who are preaching
[1:39:28] the gospel. But not only that, the whole
[1:39:32] camp, the whole church,
[1:39:34] Amen, is under must be under domination
[1:39:37] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:41] [Music]
[1:39:42] They rebelled.
[1:39:44] And they wanted a set of
[1:39:47] rules and creeds to go by.
[1:39:54] They wanted a king. They wanted to be
[1:39:57] exactly like the world.
[1:40:00] and went into complete apostasy
[1:40:04] and oblivion.
[1:40:07] That is exactly how the first church age
[1:40:09] started.
[1:40:12] Listen to what the prophet says. It will
[1:40:14] get worse and worse
[1:40:18] until the Holy Spirit is completely
[1:40:21] rejected
[1:40:24] and then God will destroy the people.
[1:40:28] See how it started out in the early
[1:40:29] church.
[1:40:31] It was called deeds.
[1:40:34] Then it became a doctrine. Then it
[1:40:36] became the standard.
[1:40:38] Then it became the unbending way.
[1:40:43] It finally took over and God was pushed
[1:40:46] aside.
[1:40:49] It started so small,
[1:40:51] so quiet. It's so inoffensively.
[1:40:55] It looked so good.
[1:40:58] It seemed so sound.
[1:41:01] Then it caught a hold
[1:41:04] like it caught a hold
[1:41:07] like a python.
[1:41:09] It squeezed out the very breath and
[1:41:12] killed all the spirituality that was in
[1:41:14] the church.
[1:41:21] That's why brother Bam says
[1:41:23] the church is not ruled by a set of
[1:41:25] elders.
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:31] We know most of the big denominations do
[1:41:33] that.
[1:41:35] They have elders
[1:41:38] council.
[1:41:39] The Roman Catholic Church has a curer
[1:41:43] called the the the the curia.
[1:41:47] It's in in Vatican
[1:41:50] whereby the cardinals
[1:41:53] council of cardinals
[1:41:55] they're the ones who choose the pope
[1:41:59] they they make laws.
[1:42:02] The Anglican church has a senate.
[1:42:06] The others have the the elders.
[1:42:10] Whenever the church is going to go in a
[1:42:12] certain direction
[1:42:14] they have to sit and make decisions.
[1:42:18] But brother says God's church is not
[1:42:20] ruled that way.
[1:42:24] God wants to be the ruler of his own
[1:42:27] church.
[1:42:30] Amen. Amen. Why do they have those kind
[1:42:35] of setup?
[1:42:40] Because God is no longer in their
[1:42:44] no longer the preeminent one.
[1:42:49] So what do you do? You have to go for
[1:42:52] the option.
[1:42:55] But we are not going to go for an
[1:42:56] option.
[1:42:58] We are going to go the God way.
[1:43:04] God wants to be the ruler of his own
[1:43:07] people.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; How did he rule them in the in the old?
[1:43:12] He had a man. He chose a man called
[1:43:15] Samuel.
[1:43:17] He anointed him. He ordained him. Then
[1:43:20] he sent him out. He said, "Go to my
[1:43:22] people.
[1:43:24] Give them this prophecy. Tell them
[1:43:27] that." And the people believed that was
[1:43:30] God. They never doubted. They never look
[1:43:34] left to right because they believed in
[1:43:38] the leadership of the Holy Ghost by a
[1:43:41] God called man.
[1:43:44] Today it is the same way.
[1:43:47] God sends us pastors,
[1:43:51] teachers, prophets.
[1:43:54] When a man comes on the platform,
[1:43:57] we believe he's not speaking his mind.
[1:44:00] He's speaking the mind of Christ.
[1:44:04] right now. You better believe the words
[1:44:06] I'm speaking are not my words.
[1:44:11] Amen. That's how God works.
[1:44:14] He sends money and
[1:44:17] it doesn't go.
[1:44:20] Amen. People
[1:44:22] also will be under the influence of the
[1:44:25] spirit
[1:44:30] in your heart.
[1:44:32] being the inside teacher
[1:44:36] will say amen.
[1:44:40] That means God has spoken.
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:44] Amen. So the God that leads a preacher
[1:44:47] on the pullpit
[1:44:49] is a God who will lead Amen. the
[1:44:52] children of God on the church.
[1:44:56] Let me tell you church, if a person
[1:44:58] comes up here
[1:45:00] and speaks something that is not a word,
[1:45:03] the spirit of God in you will point it
[1:45:05] out.
[1:45:09] That's why the seed of God cannot be
[1:45:10] deceived.
[1:45:15] Amen. And let me finish up this quote.
[1:45:19] It started so small, so quietly, so in
[1:45:21] offensively,
[1:45:24] and then like a python, it squeezed out
[1:45:25] the very breath and killed the
[1:45:27] spirituality that was in the church.
[1:45:34] Oh, that false vine is subtle.
[1:45:37] It is like an angel of light until it
[1:45:39] gets a hold on you.
[1:45:43] Now, I want to say that I believe in
[1:45:46] leadership.
[1:45:49] But it is not the leadership of men I
[1:45:51] believe in.
[1:45:54] Well, you ought to say amen to that
[1:45:55] church.
[1:45:57] I believe in the leadership of the Holy
[1:45:59] Ghost.
[1:46:04] Coming through the word.
[1:46:08] I believe also that God has set men in
[1:46:11] the church,
[1:46:15] men who are gifted by the spirit.
[1:46:18] and they will keep the church in order.
[1:46:23] Amen. It's not you know uh you know the
[1:46:28] nine spiritual gifts.
[1:46:32] It's not them that will lead the church.
[1:46:37] Those will defy the church.
[1:46:42] But it is the five-fold ministry
[1:46:46] that will lead the church
[1:46:48] by the word
[1:46:51] [Music]
[1:46:52] and they will keep the church in order.
[1:46:56] I believe that. I believe also that the
[1:46:58] church is ruled over by men
[1:47:03] that God sends to take charge,
[1:47:08] but that rule
[1:47:10] is by the word.
[1:47:14] So that it is not men really ruling by
[1:47:16] the sp but the spirit of God.
[1:47:22] For the word and the spirit are
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:28] praise the name of the Lord. And I told
[1:47:31] you that Christ is the center of your of
[1:47:33] the revelation.
[1:47:36] Christ in you makes him the center of
[1:47:38] life.
[1:47:43] It makes you the complete revelation of
[1:47:46] the whole thing.
[1:47:52] Amen. Just give me a few more minutes
[1:47:53] here.
[1:47:55] What is the new birth? Then
[1:47:58] you will say, "Well, brother, what is
[1:47:59] the new birth?"
[1:48:02] It is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:48:03] personally to you.
[1:48:07] Not you joined a church.
[1:48:10] You shook a hand. You done something
[1:48:12] different.
[1:48:14] You said a creed. You promised to leave
[1:48:16] by a corner room.
[1:48:19] But it is Christ,
[1:48:21] the Bible, he is the word that was
[1:48:23] revealed to you.
[1:48:26] And no matter what anybody say,
[1:48:31] what takes place is Christ,
[1:48:37] pastor, priest, whatever it may be,
[1:48:39] Christ in you.
[1:48:42] That is the revelation.
[1:48:45] The church was built on
[1:48:49] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Brother, it's not about me.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; It's not about any pastor.
[1:48:58] We must learn as believers of the
[1:49:01] message
[1:49:03] to know what is more important.
[1:49:09] This message is not any man.
[1:49:13] It is Christ in you.
[1:49:17] Hallelujah.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; That revelation of Christ
[1:49:20] personally to you.
[1:49:23] So no matter what anybody else say.
[1:49:27] Well, I can say if you do this, you're
[1:49:28] going to be cast.
[1:49:31] What does the word say?
[1:49:33] Does the word say that?
[1:49:36] That was just me.
[1:49:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It doesn't
[1:49:42] matter what I say.
[1:49:44] But when what I say
[1:49:47] agrees with the word,
[1:49:50] then you need to watch out.
[1:49:53] Hallelujah.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; The believer is a believer of the word,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; not a believer of a man,
[1:50:03] but a believer of the word.
[1:50:06] Hallelujah. I remember one time
[1:50:10] when I was in the Anglican church,
[1:50:13] the brother who was preaching to me,
[1:50:16] he said to me, he said,
[1:50:18] I told him, I went to my bishop
[1:50:22] and he said that he can also, they can
[1:50:24] also baptize by immersion.
[1:50:28] And then he said in Uganda to me he said
[1:50:35] your bishop with his gowns can he take
[1:50:37] you to water
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; and baptize you.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; I was offended.
[1:50:43] I was offended.
[1:50:46] I I almost walked away from this
[1:50:47] message.
[1:50:50] I loved that man.
[1:50:53] I loved that man. I saw him almost like
[1:50:56] God.
[1:50:59] So who is this man? Even if what is
[1:51:02] saying is in the Bible?
[1:51:04] How can he speak about my bishop like
[1:51:06] that?
[1:51:09] I cried by the way. Seriously, I cried.
[1:51:13] That brother's name is Brother Paul.
[1:51:16] Brother Martin knows him and a few other
[1:51:19] I cried.
[1:51:20] How can you speak about that?
[1:51:24] So you saw they saw me crying.
[1:51:27] I don't know what they thought. They
[1:51:29] must have thought that the word hit me
[1:51:31] hard.
[1:51:36] But I was offended and heartbroken.
[1:51:41] How can he speak about my bishop like
[1:51:44] that?
[1:51:46] So I started getting my hand catching.
[1:51:53] He said, "Yes, yes, yes. This is the
[1:51:55] truth. this and he was making it harder
[1:51:58] on me. So I contined to cry
[1:52:02] and I wanted to walk away from this
[1:52:03] message.
[1:52:06] This is serious. This is truth.
[1:52:08] But I tell you what, there was a seed of
[1:52:11] God in me.
[1:52:14] Amen.
[1:52:16] What the seed desires is for Christ to
[1:52:20] have the preeminence.
[1:52:27] Amen. Not not not anything.
[1:52:30] Not a creed, not a man, not anything.
[1:52:33] But Christ,
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; you've seen people leave church.
[1:52:38] Why? I was offended by so and so. Oh,
[1:52:41] church not a perfect place.
[1:52:44] You know, believers are hypocrites.
[1:52:47] That means that person is young in the
[1:52:49] faith.
[1:52:51] If you are mature in the faith,
[1:52:54] Amen. It might even be the pastor
[1:52:56] himself
[1:52:58] who might offend you
[1:53:02] or a brother or a deacon
[1:53:06] says something against you that is not
[1:53:07] true.
[1:53:09] Yes, it can happen.
[1:53:11] If you're mature, you're going to race.
[1:53:14] It's not about that guy.
[1:53:16] It's not about that brother or that
[1:53:18] sister. is about Christ.
[1:53:22] And I'm not here for him. I'm not here
[1:53:25] for her. I'm here for the one Christ in
[1:53:29] me.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Where is the glory?
[1:53:33] Christ in you.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory.
[1:53:39] And the Bible says that ye are complete
[1:53:41] in him
[1:53:44] who is the head of all principality and
[1:53:47] power.
[1:53:51] There's no room for camps.
[1:53:56] No room for camp
[1:54:00] when you are in Christ.
[1:54:03] No time
[1:54:05] and no room for camps.
[1:54:08] I've personally been with friends
[1:54:11] who pastors
[1:54:13] who wanted me to help them hurt their
[1:54:16] enemies.
[1:54:20] encouraging me to head the head
[1:54:25] not speaking like that.
[1:54:29] But you know someone doesn't come out
[1:54:30] open
[1:54:32] just begin speaking negatively about
[1:54:34] somebody else.
[1:54:36] So what do you do?
[1:54:38] You just immediately I shut off my ears.
[1:54:43] I don't have time for nonsense.
[1:54:46] I have time for Christ.
[1:54:49] I want Christ to be seen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; I want him to be lifted up in me.
[1:54:54] I want that after I have served the Lord
[1:54:58] that he would say, "Well done, my good
[1:55:00] and faithful servant.
[1:55:03] This was not about you.
[1:55:05] It was about me."
[1:55:08] [Music]
[1:55:10] Amen. He wants to have the preeminence.
[1:55:15] He wants to have the preeminence.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; And and and friends, I'm I just I'm just
[1:55:21] going to quit from here, but I've not
[1:55:22] even gone into um anything that I wanted
[1:55:26] to talk about yet.
[1:55:31] But let us stand on our feet.
[1:55:41] When you begin to see People
[1:55:45] talk so much about themselves,
[1:55:49] talk so much about their organizations,
[1:55:53] their church, their accomplishments.
[1:55:56] Then it's no longer about Christ.
[1:56:00] [Music]
[1:56:02] What happened
[1:56:04] to talking about the souls we have won
[1:56:06] for Christ?
[1:56:09] [Music]
[1:56:10] What happened
[1:56:12] about having a burden for the lost soul?
[1:56:16] What happened
[1:56:19] about our desire
[1:56:22] to get deeper in the message
[1:56:26] to know him?
[1:56:28] The Bible says to know him is life at
[1:56:30] heart.
[1:56:32] How do you know him?
[1:56:36] You know him by receiving him.
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:42] If Christ is in you,
[1:56:45] then is the hope of glory.
[1:56:49] You just want to be consumed by by him.
[1:56:56] Every part of your life,
[1:56:58] you want him to lead you to God.
[1:57:03] Even sometimes
[1:57:07] when everything is not dandy or or or
[1:57:10] good around,
[1:57:14] you come back to him.
[1:57:17] Say, Lord,
[1:57:18] it is you that I love.
[1:57:22] It is you that I I received.
[1:57:26] Lead me now.
[1:57:28] When was the last time you asked him to
[1:57:31] lead you before you made a big decision?
[1:57:36] You want to have him lead you.
[1:57:44] Touching Jesus
[1:57:48] is all that really matters.
[1:57:55] And your life
[1:57:57] will never be
[1:58:00] the same.
[1:58:03] [Music]
