[15:15] of glory, gathered into your presence,
[15:19] Lord. and those who are gathered online.
[15:22] King of glory, we pray for them. Loving

[15:36] to keep thee in the way, to bring thee
[15:41] into the presence that have prepared,

[17:25] of Father, the humans criticize, Lord,
[17:28] but you're full of love. You're full of
[17:31] mercy. You always speak good things. Oh
[17:34] Lord Jesus, when I remember Abel's
[17:37] blood, Lord Father, it could speak
[17:40] vengeance. Oh Lord Father, but when you
[17:42] came onto the cross, you spoke mercy.
[17:46] You spoke forgiveness. You gave us life.
[17:49] You sent us thy son. You gave us thy
[17:52] spirit to guide us, Lord Jesus. Father,
[17:56] in time of need, you're always in there,
[17:59] Lord. Father in times of trouble, you're

[18:25] come and minister unto us. Father, let
[18:28] that word multiply within us. King of
[18:31] glory. Father, may it come and change
[18:33] us. May it come and transform us.
[18:35] Father, King of glory, we pray, Lord,
[18:37] Father, for believers who are on their
[18:39] way coming. Father, may you fasten onto

[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:19] Bring the little ones, brother Shalom.
[1:11:25] Bring them in. Bring them in.
[1:11:30] Oh, bring them in.
[1:11:35] Bring them in from the field of sea.
[1:11:44] Bring them.
[1:11:48] Bring them in.
[1:11:52] Bring them
[1:11:55] on to Jesus.
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:01] Very, very handsome baby.
[1:12:06] Uh, Brother Luanga has wonderful young
[1:12:10] men.
[1:12:13] Where's the rest of the family? Can you
[1:12:14] Can you all come here?
[1:12:18] Are they only these ones?
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:32] The Bible says
[1:12:35] produce and multiply.
[1:12:38] But the promise is not for only you
[1:12:41] alone. And you know they are raising
[1:12:43] sister Juliet is really raising some
[1:12:44] wonderful young people
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:50] and uh it's a it's a blessed family.
[1:12:55] So uh uh you know I always say that when
[1:12:59] you have boys you have a lot of work
[1:13:04] for very many years.
[1:13:06] So we pray that God will give brother
[1:13:12] to do that job.
[1:13:14] Amen. Let us all harm ourselves. This
[1:13:16] baby is called Daniela.
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] Let's dedicate him before the Lord.
[1:13:27] Loving Jesus,
[1:13:29] you're the one that brought this couple
[1:13:31] together.
[1:13:33] Our precious brother Luanga Henry,
[1:13:37] his wife, sister Julia
[1:13:40] and Father Lord, you've given them to
[1:13:42] this assembly.
[1:13:45] I remember about three years ago when
[1:13:47] they came to me and
[1:13:49] said they wanted to come and put their
[1:13:51] shoulders to the wheel.
[1:13:55] and support the work of God here.
[1:13:58] And ever since, Lord, they have served
[1:14:00] faithfully,
[1:14:03] Lord, in in different capacities.
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:07] And Lord, you have also not ceased to
[1:14:09] bless them.
[1:14:12] And now, Lord, you've blessed them with
[1:14:13] this little one,
[1:14:16] Daniel. Daniel Muka.
[1:14:19] Lord, I pray that as they have named
[1:14:21] this child,
[1:14:24] Because we know that a name has usually
[1:14:26] a meaning
[1:14:30] something it is pointing to.
[1:14:33] May this child be a blessing
[1:14:37] in the home. Lord and Lord as you use
[1:14:40] Daniel of old
[1:14:42] father. He was a prophet.
[1:14:45] He served you Lord through even times
[1:14:49] which were not easy
[1:14:51] but he stood for you and he declared
[1:14:53] your word.
[1:14:55] Now Lord we pray that so will it be for
[1:14:57] this child
[1:15:00] that he will serve the Lord. We have a
[1:15:02] backbone to stand for your word.
[1:15:06] Lord we we we we we receive this child
[1:15:10] in your name Lord and dedicate him to
[1:15:12] you. Lord, we pray that the devil will
[1:15:15] not have hands upon him.
[1:15:18] You'll keep him away from every power of
[1:15:19] darkness,
[1:15:21] every clanic spirits,
[1:15:24] every power of hell. It will not prevail
[1:15:27] over this child. Preserve him, I pray,
[1:15:30] oh God under the power of the Holy
[1:15:32] Spirit. And father Lord, may he be a
[1:15:35] blessing to them.
[1:15:37] And we dedicate the entire Langa family,
[1:15:39] Lord,
[1:15:41] into your hands, Lord Jesus. and all the
[1:15:43] children, Father Lord, that they will
[1:15:46] serve the Lord, Lord, we commit them now
[1:15:49] to you in the precious name of our Lord.
[1:15:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:16:01] And the baby's saying, "Amen."
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:06] Praise the Lord. Let's clap for them as
[1:16:09] they're going back.
[1:16:15] Um, I have a note here. God bless you
[1:16:17] saints. Receive greetings from Mitana
[1:16:19] where I have spent the past two weeks
[1:16:21] working on the church floor.
[1:16:34] This is from brother Martin
[1:16:37] where yesterday I mean on Saturday
[1:16:39] Saturday I informed you that on Friday I
[1:16:41] informed you that he was in Mana.
[1:16:45] Welcome back brother Martin.
[1:16:48] Thank God for preserving.
[1:16:51] Amen. And also I always forget but
[1:16:53] sometimes ministers ask me to greet you.
[1:16:58] So receive greetings from pastor in
[1:17:02] in in the city of Melbourne, Australia,
[1:17:05] Melbourne, Australia. He uh he asked me
[1:17:08] to greet the church.
[1:17:10] Amen. And and um we trust that uh this
[1:17:13] morning the Lord will minister to us.
[1:17:17] Uh through his word, how many have come
[1:17:20] here expected?
[1:17:23] Amen.
[1:17:24] Now we we have a meeting after the
[1:17:27] service.
[1:17:30] um um uh with the uh team leaders for
[1:17:33] the land fund.
[1:17:38] Um we had another one we had a meeting
[1:17:41] last Sunday
[1:17:44] with a church where we discussed a lot
[1:17:45] of things
[1:17:48] and many of you were some of you were
[1:17:50] not here many actually were here
[1:17:54] and that was not good
[1:17:56] but those who were here were represented
[1:17:59] us
[1:18:01] and I wanted to say that we noticed in
[1:18:04] that meeting
[1:18:07] that uh Uh we we have a a burden and a
[1:18:10] vision of buying our church land,
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:16] but I we realize that not everyone among
[1:18:19] us is faithfully contributing to that
[1:18:22] cause.
[1:18:27] Um can I have the land report for this
[1:18:30] week, please?
[1:18:34] Just wanted to make a few comments on
[1:18:35] this to the whole church.
[1:18:39] just pull out the paper for this week
[1:18:40] only
[1:18:44] le I fumble around the papers. Okay.
[1:18:50] So, uh I see that this week we have
[1:18:52] given a total of 800,000
[1:18:58] and of course you can break it down to
[1:19:00] through the seven weeks the seven
[1:19:01] groups.
[1:19:04] So if you see for example Paul
[1:19:08] I wanted to just sample
[1:19:11] uh who is the leader of Paul.
[1:19:15] How many people do you have? How many
[1:19:17] believers do you have in your group
[1:19:21] total?
[1:19:24] 50.
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:28] How many gave this 95?
[1:19:32] Four.
[1:19:34] So she has 15 members in her group
[1:19:39] and only four game.
[1:19:41] So we and remember this these are really
[1:19:43] free will contributions.
[1:19:47] I know we have had some people getting
[1:19:49] offended thinking that uh you know it's
[1:19:51] all about and it's mandatory everybody
[1:19:54] who is coming must
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:00] never feel burdened.
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:03] If you don't have the revelation,
[1:20:06] you know, always always uh giving is
[1:20:10] part of serving God.
[1:20:14] But you see, it must be by revelation
[1:20:18] and you know out of the abundance of
[1:20:20] your heart.
[1:20:23] You never feel cornered to do something
[1:20:25] for God.
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:30] Whatever you do for the Lord, if you
[1:20:33] want a blessing out of him, it must be a
[1:20:36] personal revelation.
[1:20:40] Is that a man? And you do it. The Bible
[1:20:43] says God loves a cheerful giver.
[1:20:47] Amen. So now when you see five, is it
[1:20:52] four five who have given this week?
[1:20:54] Five, it means 10 in our group did not
[1:20:58] give anything.
[1:21:01] So to them it is either two things
[1:21:05] it is either the whole week
[1:21:08] they could not afford to give anything
[1:21:10] even 1,000
[1:21:13] they were not able
[1:21:15] or
[1:21:17] um they did not they have not yet caught
[1:21:20] the vision
[1:21:23] and uh um I would like to incline to
[1:21:26] think that many have not yet caught the
[1:21:29] vision.
[1:21:33] Otherwise, I'm sure if you are
[1:21:34] contributing,
[1:21:37] if you're going to to contribute towards
[1:21:40] making
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:46] cemetery. Yeah. If they say that we are
[1:21:48] building a cemetery, a cemetery,
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:55] even if you don't go, you will give.
[1:21:58] We say if I said today we are tomorrow
[1:22:00] we are planning a party
[1:22:03] for every church member
[1:22:05] who gives ah people will give you will
[1:22:09] be surprised. You may find brotherh
[1:22:13] giving 1 million
[1:22:16] and then you wonder where did it come.
[1:22:19] So is it because he's not able to give
[1:22:20] now?
[1:22:22] No. Maybe he has not quite caught the
[1:22:24] revenue
[1:22:26] and and also John Weasley
[1:22:30] John Weasley gave 4,000
[1:22:34] the team leader tell me how many do you
[1:22:35] have in
[1:22:38] the saints
[1:22:40] total
[1:22:42] 15
[1:22:44] and how many have given this
[1:22:47] three
[1:22:49] are you seeing the trend
[1:22:51] it's only the minority that are giving
[1:22:55] Okay, three makes it perfect.
[1:22:59] I I will I will call out another group.
[1:23:03] Cola.
[1:23:05] Okay. Uh let me mention the group which
[1:23:07] gave the most.
[1:23:10] Martin Luther. Where's the team leader?
[1:23:13] Martin. How many do you have?
[1:23:18] 24.
[1:23:19] Okay. Is that why you gave a lot of
[1:23:21] money?
[1:23:23] How many gave this?
[1:23:27] Eight. Did you see that? Same thing. So
[1:23:31] you might think ah there are so many.
[1:23:34] No,
[1:23:36] it's the minority that are giving.
[1:23:40] And not only that, even those who are
[1:23:43] giving
[1:23:44] among those people they mentioned, you
[1:23:47] will find that some of them are not
[1:23:50] actually members yet.
[1:23:54] They are they members of the bride
[1:23:58] but they are not a part of this
[1:23:59] fellowship
[1:24:01] but they are supporting the work here
[1:24:04] wanting to support the cause. So you can
[1:24:06] see that we here
[1:24:09] need to catch the revelation
[1:24:11] but also let me say this whether you
[1:24:14] catch the revelation or you don't
[1:24:18] the work of God cannot be hindered.
[1:24:22] Whatever God has purposed to do
[1:24:25] will be done with or without you.
[1:24:29] But you see, I feel it is an opportunity
[1:24:35] for me to be a part of what God is doing
[1:24:39] because that way when I serve God,
[1:24:42] I know he must bless me. He must bless
[1:24:45] the work of my hand. He must He must
[1:24:48] bless what I'm doing.
[1:24:50] And um you know I want to be a part of
[1:24:52] what God is doing.
[1:24:54] So I ask you to do you want to be a part
[1:24:58] of what God is doing?
[1:25:04] It it is a vision that you must catch.
[1:25:08] If you say you're a member of the
[1:25:09] church,
[1:25:10] what are you doing?
[1:25:13] Are you saying that let somebody else do
[1:25:14] it?
[1:25:16] Let others who have the the money do it.
[1:25:20] And many of us keep pushing it to the
[1:25:22] future.
[1:25:25] I'll give when God gives me.
[1:25:28] How many here believe that they will
[1:25:29] give when God gives them?
[1:25:34] Well, no one will now put up their hand.
[1:25:36] But let me show tell you something. If
[1:25:39] you are not with whatever you have now,
[1:25:44] if you're not serving God,
[1:25:46] even when you get much more or much
[1:25:49] better,
[1:25:51] you will not serve God.
[1:25:55] Whatever you are using your money for
[1:25:57] today
[1:26:00] is what you will use it when you have
[1:26:02] more.
[1:26:07] Are you are you listening to me church?
[1:26:10] So you cannot claim you have you don't
[1:26:13] have enough
[1:26:16] and that's the reason why you are not
[1:26:17] giving
[1:26:19] usually all of us here
[1:26:22] don't have enough
[1:26:24] none of us here that I know of
[1:26:27] that has enough.
[1:26:30] If you are not married
[1:26:32] you are needy. If you are married, you
[1:26:35] are more needy. If you have children,
[1:26:38] you are more more needy.
[1:26:41] The body of Christ is always needed.
[1:26:47] So what are you going to do? You are
[1:26:50] going to serve God with what you have
[1:26:53] now,
[1:26:54] not later.
[1:26:56] So nobody's going to force you. Nobody's
[1:26:59] going to push you. But I'm encouraging.
[1:27:04] Serve God while you can.
[1:27:07] Time is coming when you can.
[1:27:10] Amen. And that cannot be overemphasized.
[1:27:16] Um, where is Sister Susan? Is she here
[1:27:18] this morning?
[1:27:20] All right. Sister Susan is right behind.
[1:27:22] Raise up your hand if
[1:27:25] Sister Susan called me this actually.
[1:27:27] Brother Brian called me this week.
[1:27:31] And uh when I went there I found also
[1:27:33] sister Susan there
[1:27:36] and uh you know sister Susan lives in a
[1:27:38] certain area
[1:27:40] where she knew over land. So when we had
[1:27:43] the meeting and we told everybody go and
[1:27:45] check out if you get land.
[1:27:51] So they found uh they invited me to go
[1:27:53] and visit that land
[1:27:58] and it's a real good land.
[1:28:01] Um um it's uh around Sunday
[1:28:07] actually at the end of uh after stabics
[1:28:13] just after that swamp
[1:28:15] then when you just going up
[1:28:18] it it's in a very good location
[1:28:22] almost on the road I think about 50
[1:28:24] mters from the road
[1:28:27] and uh so it's a very good land
[1:28:30] willing we are looking at buying that.
[1:28:34] I have already met the owner
[1:28:37] and uh we prayed over it on Friday.
[1:28:42] If the Lord is willing, this man is
[1:28:45] going to um he looks all indication to
[1:28:47] show that he might actually accept for
[1:28:50] us to give him a certain amount
[1:28:56] and then the rest we pay it slowly.
[1:29:00] that will save us from a bank loan.
[1:29:03] But um the indications show that he
[1:29:06] might accept 150 million.
[1:29:11] That's way more than what we have now.
[1:29:15] But you keep in prayers
[1:29:18] and uh we will be discussing with the
[1:29:20] church land team members
[1:29:26] and also also the other concerned
[1:29:28] believers. If you want to stay, please
[1:29:29] stay
[1:29:33] so we can discuss that.
[1:29:37] Well, the Lord bless you. It's taken a
[1:29:38] little while, but I think it is worth
[1:29:39] it.
[1:29:43] Is that okay?
[1:29:45] Amen.
[1:29:48] Uh let us now stand and we go into the
[1:29:50] word.
[1:30:00] Revelation chapter 3.
[1:30:13] We had a good service on Friday
[1:30:18] and those who miss you really missed.
[1:30:22] You know, whenever you hear that we have
[1:30:24] a visitor
[1:30:26] or let me even put it this way. Whenever
[1:30:27] you hear that we have a service,
[1:30:31] please come because God has something
[1:30:33] prepared for you.
[1:30:36] When God sends you somebody here,
[1:30:40] when there is a service, when there's a
[1:30:42] church service going on
[1:30:45] at your church, you cannot afford to be
[1:30:48] anywhere.
[1:30:53] That's what we've been taught by the
[1:30:54] prophet.
[1:30:56] You know, that's why if there are
[1:30:58] special meetings
[1:31:01] and as a ministry, we believe in what is
[1:31:03] going on there.
[1:31:05] If we believe in what is going on,
[1:31:09] we usually close our meetings
[1:31:12] and then everybody should be
[1:31:15] because it's not a competition.
[1:31:18] But if we the Lord is leading us
[1:31:21] differently,
[1:31:23] always be at your home church.
[1:31:28] I felt that some really missed what the
[1:31:30] Lord was uh intending to do for us.
[1:31:36] But nonetheless,
[1:31:38] the Lord is full of mercies
[1:31:42] and he will speak to us this morning.
[1:31:46] We are reading um vers 14.
[1:31:52] Um
[1:32:00] we will read up to verse 22.
[1:32:04] So listen carefully.
[1:32:07] You know we are in the book we've been
[1:32:09] in the book of revelation for the past
[1:32:10] two weeks.
[1:32:13] We've been around chapter five.
[1:32:16] I think brother Shem was also dealing
[1:32:18] with chapter four
[1:32:20] and you know we've been reading chapter
[1:32:22] 10
[1:32:24] but we are trying to build something
[1:32:26] here
[1:32:28] which I believe that you should pay
[1:32:29] attention.
[1:32:32] Look at verses 14 there.
[1:32:35] And unto the angel of the church of the
[1:32:37] ladicians, uh, write these things, saith
[1:32:40] the amen, the faithful and true witness,
[1:32:42] the beginning of the creation of God.
[1:32:55] I know thy works that thou art neither
[1:32:57] cold nor hot. I would thou art what cold
[1:33:01] or hot.
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:09] So then, because thou art lukewarm, and
[1:33:12] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:33:14] out of my mouth.
[1:33:26] I am rich and increased with goods and
[1:33:30] have need of nothing. And knowest not
[1:33:32] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[1:33:36] poor and blind and naked.
[1:33:54] This is the condition of La Lisa.
[1:33:57] They think they have everything they
[1:33:59] need.
[1:34:01] They are rich increased with goods.
[1:34:03] They know the whole scriptures. They
[1:34:05] know the Bible. They have this. They
[1:34:06] have that. They don't need anything from
[1:34:08] anything.
[1:34:11] If you walk on the street today
[1:34:13] and you try to evangelize to somebody,
[1:34:16] they will tell you.
[1:34:18] In other words, I don't need what you're
[1:34:20] telling me.
[1:34:23] Go preach to others who need it.
[1:34:25] But really, God thinks of them
[1:34:29] as if they are wretched, miserable,
[1:34:31] poor, and
[1:34:33] they naked, and they don't know.
[1:34:37] That's the sad part.
[1:34:39] And then the advice says,
[1:34:42] I counel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:34:45] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:34:48] white rament that thou mayest be closed
[1:34:50] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:34:52] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:34:54] thy eyes that thou mayest see.
[1:35:13] Amen. Amen. That's the message of
[1:35:16] Yahweh.
[1:35:18] The true word is what dresses us
[1:35:22] and covers our shame, the shame of our
[1:35:24] nakedness.
[1:35:26] As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten
[1:35:28] bezel us thereof and repent.
[1:35:34] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:35:37] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:35:39] door, I will come into him, and I will s
[1:35:42] with him and he with me.
[1:35:53] Uh, and I hope you don't mind standing
[1:35:54] for a few moments.
[1:35:56] We are all standing. So, I want you to
[1:35:59] listen to this part.
[1:36:01] where he says uh behold I stand at the
[1:36:03] door and knock
[1:36:06] in in
[1:36:09] this age Christ is out of the church
[1:36:14] he has been kicked out by the people who
[1:36:17] are actually supposed to be his wife his
[1:36:19] bride
[1:36:22] but he is outside he's knocking he's
[1:36:26] pleading he's saying he that opens for
[1:36:30] I will come in. So he's a gentleman.
[1:36:33] He's not going to bang the door open.
[1:36:37] You have to open for him first and then
[1:36:40] he will come in. But you see not
[1:36:42] everybody will
[1:36:44] very few will open. Others are concerned
[1:36:47] with many other things.
[1:36:50] Do you remember the first sermon brother
[1:36:51] Shem preached here?
[1:36:54] That was really nice and on on how he is
[1:36:57] outside your lover is outside
[1:37:01] and you know he's asking for you to open
[1:37:03] for him and then you are busy saying I'm
[1:37:06] busy
[1:37:07] and by the time you come out he's gone.
[1:37:11] You know it was out of the song of
[1:37:12] Solomon. But I tell you friend, this is
[1:37:15] what is happening in our age.
[1:37:18] Christ is on the outside of the of the
[1:37:20] church and is bleeding to come in.
[1:37:25] But vers 21 now says to him that
[1:37:29] overcometh,
[1:37:31] Amen. This is what I'm going to speak
[1:37:32] about. To him that overcometh
[1:37:35] will I grant to sit with me in my
[1:37:37] throne.
[1:37:39] So this year is not easy.
[1:37:41] It's it's not cold, not hot. It is
[1:37:45] blind, naked, wretched, but they don't
[1:37:47] know. They're confused. They have
[1:37:50] amnesia.
[1:37:51] They don't know who they are. And then
[1:37:53] we find out Christ is out of their
[1:37:56] hearts.
[1:37:58] They rejected.
[1:38:00] But he says there is going to be an
[1:38:02] overcomer.
[1:38:04] And he says to him that overcome,
[1:38:07] I will grant with to sit with me in my
[1:38:10] throne,
[1:38:12] even as I also overcame,
[1:38:16] and I'm set down with my father in his
[1:38:18] throne.
[1:38:20] Is that amen? He that has an ear, let
[1:38:22] him hear what the spirit say unto the
[1:38:26] Amen. You may be seated.
[1:38:29] God bless you.
[1:38:31] Let's Let's pray.
[1:38:34] Father Lord, we have read a portion of
[1:38:35] your word once again.
[1:38:38] We ask that you, the writer, the author
[1:38:40] of this word,
[1:38:43] you may come and interpret these things
[1:38:44] to us
[1:38:46] and may you give us the grace to
[1:38:48] understand
[1:38:49] what your holy spirit wants us to in
[1:38:52] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:38:55] Brother, brother, brother Shalom, if you
[1:38:58] can come and help me with the with this.
[1:39:02] Um, I'm speaking on same subject really,
[1:39:06] our true origin,
[1:39:10] but today my title is the overcomers.
[1:39:16] The overcomers.
[1:39:18] Amen.
[1:39:20] Are you here?
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:24] Are you here church?
[1:39:27] That is still 10% of it.
[1:39:30] Some people are hungry. I don't remember
[1:39:33] the last time I ate breakfast on a
[1:39:35] Sunday morning,
[1:39:38] but I'm always strong
[1:39:40] because I I just want to be with the
[1:39:42] Lord.
[1:39:44] So, I don't know how many of you have
[1:39:46] eaten breakfast
[1:39:48] or have not eaten, but let the flesh
[1:39:50] out. Let the spirit speak to us today.
[1:39:54] We have not come here as a tradition.
[1:39:58] Sunday morning we go to church. We have
[1:40:01] come here seriously.
[1:40:03] Seriously.
[1:40:05] For serious business.
[1:40:08] Is that amen? How many have come for
[1:40:10] serious business?
[1:40:13] You know, you know when you're at home
[1:40:14] and you're free and
[1:40:18] you're watching something on YouTube,
[1:40:20] you cannot do. But many times when
[1:40:24] people say, "Okay, let's have our family
[1:40:26] out."
[1:40:29] Then you begin to see people yarning.
[1:40:34] The day was very long. We are very
[1:40:37] tired.
[1:40:38] That's that's a strategy that the devil
[1:40:40] uses.
[1:40:43] to always when the word comes, when it's
[1:40:46] time for singing,
[1:40:49] everybody's throwing their feet up and
[1:40:51] people are happy. But when it's time for
[1:40:53] the word, the devil will make you busy,
[1:40:58] feeling weak, feeling dizzy. That's when
[1:41:01] all the feelings in the body will come.
[1:41:04] But I denounce that in the name of
[1:41:06] Jesus.
[1:41:08] Amen. I pray that this morning we we
[1:41:10] must be we must be controlling our body.
[1:41:14] Let's control our body. Tell your body
[1:41:17] whether you want or not. You are going
[1:41:19] to listen to the word when you are sober
[1:41:21] this morning.
[1:41:24] Amen. I want people who are sober this
[1:41:26] morning
[1:41:28] not really sober as sober.
[1:41:31] Maybe you can be a little drunk. That's
[1:41:33] okay.
[1:41:35] But in the spirit
[1:41:38] Praise the name of the Lord. And I had
[1:41:40] forgotten to mention that brother
[1:41:42] brother Julius
[1:41:45] traveled to minister
[1:41:47] somewhere in I think it's called
[1:41:51] a pastor there. Brother Michael
[1:41:54] invited him to minister and he called me
[1:41:58] and he sent greetings to the church as
[1:41:59] well.
[1:42:02] Amen. And brother Michael asked me to
[1:42:03] greet the church.
[1:42:05] And uh we pray that God will bless them
[1:42:07] there as well.
[1:42:09] Amen.
[1:42:11] So now the overcomers.
[1:42:14] I've been studying the word quite a lot
[1:42:20] and um I have been studying the word
[1:42:22] quite a lot
[1:42:24] and I'm realizing that you know there is
[1:42:26] a lot of depth
[1:42:30] that we need to get to.
[1:42:32] to come as believers.
[1:42:36] I don't know what you're doing you
[1:42:38] you're using your time for,
[1:42:42] but I I just pray that you all we all
[1:42:44] get a hunger
[1:42:47] for the word
[1:42:50] that at least you can spend your time
[1:42:52] studying the Bible
[1:42:56] or at least you can spend your time uh
[1:42:59] you know listening to the message.
[1:43:02] I've had uh one of you was telling me um
[1:43:06] called me this week said, "Pastor, I'm
[1:43:07] having a hard time understanding the the
[1:43:10] the accent of Brother Bam.
[1:43:22] And I'm not picking anything.
[1:43:25] Maybe you are one of those
[1:43:27] and you feel you can't listen to the
[1:43:29] message. When pastor said go listen to
[1:43:31] the message, you said okay I'll go. I'll
[1:43:33] go and then you switch on
[1:43:40] can understand anything.
[1:43:44] Let me leave these things.
[1:43:46] Don't leave those things.
[1:43:48] I'm going to tell you what you will do.
[1:43:51] Amen. And you will do it for about three
[1:43:54] messages
[1:43:56] and you'll be done.
[1:43:59] Um um you put on a tape if you have a
[1:44:03] smartphone.
[1:44:06] Uh use it to switch on the me the table
[1:44:10] software.
[1:44:13] How many have the table software?
[1:44:16] Raise up your hand. Let's see. Raise it
[1:44:17] up high. How many don't?
[1:44:20] If you have a smartphone,
[1:44:22] raise raise up your hand.
[1:44:25] Okay. Now, those of you who have a
[1:44:27] smartphone and you don't have the tables
[1:44:29] of, please don't go before you meet, you
[1:44:34] know, any of these ministers.
[1:44:37] could be me, brother Shalom, Brother
[1:44:39] Martin,
[1:44:41] Brother Daniel, you know, any of those
[1:44:43] brothers,
[1:44:45] they know brother,
[1:44:48] they will help you to download or any of
[1:44:50] these young people.
[1:44:52] You see, this is the software I'm
[1:44:53] talking about.
[1:44:56] You don't have to pay a cobo for it.
[1:44:59] It is a free of charge.
[1:45:01] So, what happens
[1:45:04] it will have the words there
[1:45:08] and you can listen as well.
[1:45:13] Okay. So, let's try to play something
[1:45:15] here for you.
[1:45:18] Um I don't know. I have this burden of
[1:45:20] you getting these things.
[1:45:24] It is just so good for you to miss
[1:45:30] which I feel that God has granted me
[1:45:32] favor with him. If I can find your
[1:45:35] confidence, I'm sure there'll be
[1:45:37] something that will happen during the
[1:45:38] meeting
[1:45:41] with us.
[1:45:42] This one always listens. That's why he
[1:45:44] can be able to tell those things. Now,
[1:45:47] you see
[1:45:49] as he as it is playing,
[1:45:52] as he is talking,
[1:45:55] the words are moving
[1:45:57] and you can read and follow.
[1:46:01] If you think you have missed something,
[1:46:04] You can pause and read it fast. I had
[1:46:07] say I heard him say,
[1:46:10] "Oh, it is divine."
[1:46:13] Okay. Now, next time you listen again,
[1:46:16] you will know. When he says divine, he
[1:46:20] meant divine.
[1:46:22] Are you following me?
[1:46:25] Now you do that one message,
[1:46:28] you listen and finish. The second
[1:46:30] message you listen
[1:46:33] the third by the time you go to the
[1:46:35] fourth you realize you don't even need
[1:46:37] to read
[1:46:39] you can listen to everything
[1:46:43] I started listening to the message when
[1:46:45] I was 15 years
[1:46:48] and in a few months because you see I
[1:46:51] was forced the the place where I was
[1:46:53] staying at pastor Leo's house
[1:46:56] and I'm writing a book about these
[1:46:57] things
[1:46:58] you know I to listen cuz they would put
[1:47:00] the tape.
[1:47:03] Even if you have unbelievers in your
[1:47:04] home,
[1:47:06] put the tape on.
[1:47:08] They will listen by force.
[1:47:11] For me, I used to listen before I even
[1:47:12] believe.
[1:47:14] And by the time I believe, I was already
[1:47:17] used to the voice. So, I could hear
[1:47:20] everything. She's not hearing. And
[1:47:23] brother, I tell you, I have trouble with
[1:47:25] Rep. If you are called a message
[1:47:27] believer, you believe you're a healer to
[1:47:30] know what the message is saying.
[1:47:34] Don't listen from others.
[1:47:36] Don't wait to come and hear what your
[1:47:38] pastor is saying about you.
[1:47:40] You yourself go for yourself.
[1:47:43] Dip your weak into the oil
[1:47:47] and get for yourself. Get fired up for
[1:47:50] yourself.
[1:47:51] How many are understanding what I'm
[1:47:52] saying? If you are going to do it, say
[1:47:55] amen.
[1:47:57] And I tell you, if you try to do it,
[1:48:00] oh, God is going to bless you.
[1:48:02] You will begin, you will realize you
[1:48:04] have received another way, another
[1:48:06] hunger and another thirst
[1:48:10] that when a preacher begins to preach,
[1:48:12] there is a way you enjoying the word
[1:48:15] more than before. But if you're just a
[1:48:18] church member
[1:48:20] who just likes watching these jokes,
[1:48:25] you know, you you like watching these
[1:48:26] unserious things
[1:48:31] and then you come to church, you are the
[1:48:33] one who going to be dozing in the
[1:48:34] church,
[1:48:37] are you listening?
[1:48:39] You want to go watch movies
[1:48:42] the whole week. You can't even have time
[1:48:45] for family altar at home.
[1:48:48] You just go to bed.
[1:48:52] You duck in the bed. You never get time
[1:48:55] to sit, kneel down and pray.
[1:48:58] Some of you have children, maybe even
[1:48:59] your children don't know how to pray.
[1:49:03] But the children who disturb in the
[1:49:04] church,
[1:49:06] it means at home they don't pray
[1:49:09] and that's why they don't respect the
[1:49:10] presence of God.
[1:49:12] So it's very important for us to raise
[1:49:15] our families.
[1:49:17] in the way we believe that is right.
[1:49:21] Are you following me church? That's how
[1:49:24] we have to do it. As a father of the
[1:49:27] home, it is your right
[1:49:31] to teach your children.
[1:49:34] I don't know this this morning what's
[1:49:36] happening
[1:49:37] but I want to go but then something.
[1:49:41] Let me finish this.
[1:49:42] as a father of the home especially in
[1:49:45] all those homes that have fathers
[1:49:48] but I understand there are some homes
[1:49:49] without believing fathers or without
[1:49:51] fathers
[1:49:53] we'll come to those but for now I'm
[1:49:56] talking we'll come to those we'll come
[1:49:59] for now I'm talking about homes with
[1:50:01] fathers
[1:50:03] amen it is it is the duty of a father to
[1:50:08] ensure that his children are serving God
[1:50:13] and they know the God he served
[1:50:16] as long as they still young. When they
[1:50:18] grow, it is very hard to change them.
[1:50:22] But when they are still young, you can
[1:50:25] mold them in the way you want them to
[1:50:26] be.
[1:50:28] And the Bible says they will never
[1:50:29] depart from me
[1:50:31] in my home. I don't care. I have
[1:50:34] sometimes big boys and
[1:50:37] it is a rule.
[1:50:39] If it is family altar,
[1:50:41] everyone must be there.
[1:50:44] Even if you are sleeping, they will wake
[1:50:47] you up.
[1:50:49] Time for God is time for God
[1:50:52] without exception of anybody.
[1:50:54] Cuz that's how my mother raised me.
[1:50:57] That's how we were raised in God.
[1:51:00] You sleep during family.
[1:51:02] And this was even Anglican church,
[1:51:05] not even me church. But we were raised
[1:51:07] like that. because it was in the
[1:51:09] reawakened movement revival.
[1:51:14] You know, every evening, we gather
[1:51:18] around, we have the Bibles, we read, we
[1:51:22] pray, repent, we sleep. That's how it
[1:51:27] was every day.
[1:51:29] Even repentance was a part of that.
[1:51:31] Everyone had to repent.
[1:51:34] That is how you were doing it.
[1:51:38] awakening
[1:51:40] and God forgive me
[1:51:42] told me to wash dishes and I and I got
[1:51:45] mad
[1:51:48] for I repent
[1:51:51] every day we repent
[1:51:53] in the evening but you believers you
[1:51:57] don't repent to the ones you you you you
[1:51:58] you hurt
[1:52:01] you don't even repent to God
[1:52:04] and you don't even pray
[1:52:06] you just duck in the bed
[1:52:11] and the parents you are going to have to
[1:52:13] answer for it.
[1:52:17] Even to those of homes without father
[1:52:20] the mother you have that if you're a
[1:52:22] believing mother it is your right to
[1:52:24] raise your children in the way you
[1:52:25] believe
[1:52:28] in the way of the word how can your
[1:52:31] child still under your roof
[1:52:35] tell you I will not come to pray
[1:52:38] why I'm not feeling well
[1:52:41] and you say okay
[1:52:43] all right junior you can
[1:52:48] in in our home. You say that to mother,
[1:52:54] you will get
[1:53:00] forgive me. There was not even that
[1:53:02] opportunity.
[1:53:04] You do that
[1:53:06] parents these days
[1:53:08] brother said we call it child
[1:53:11] delinquency
[1:53:14] but it is also pain
[1:53:19] that's why our generation is the way it
[1:53:20] is
[1:53:22] mother father you must have a backbone
[1:53:26] and control over your children
[1:53:29] and even you children if you think
[1:53:31] you're so
[1:53:33] that you have your own rights
[1:53:36] host at your home.
[1:53:38] That's how I tell them in my house. As
[1:53:41] long as you in my house, it is my rules.
[1:53:45] But if you want your rules, then go
[1:53:48] start your own and you have your rules,
[1:53:51] then God, you will be answerable before
[1:53:52] God.
[1:53:54] But as for me, Joshua said, as for me
[1:53:58] and my house,
[1:54:01] meaning everybody and everything in my
[1:54:03] house,
[1:54:05] sometimes even our dog comes on the
[1:54:06] family house.
[1:54:11] As for me and my heart, we will serve
[1:54:14] the Lord. We have to make that
[1:54:15] resolution, friends.
[1:54:18] It is a is what the word requires of us.
[1:54:23] Rahab did not have a husband,
[1:54:26] she was alone. But when it came time to
[1:54:28] claim the token,
[1:54:31] she did not claim the token over herself
[1:54:32] only.
[1:54:34] She said to them, "My father, my mother,
[1:54:38] my brother, my sister, my uncle, my
[1:54:40] everybody in my house." And they told
[1:54:44] them, "Bring everybody
[1:54:46] under your roof
[1:54:49] and they will not be be dead.
[1:54:52] So everybody you bring under the token
[1:54:56] cannot die. Hallelujah. Are you hearing
[1:54:59] me? And so we have those those rights
[1:55:03] as believers.
[1:55:05] Are you saying I should serve God by
[1:55:07] force?
[1:55:09] No, you serve God by choice.
[1:55:12] But as long as you are under my
[1:55:13] responsibility,
[1:55:16] it is my rules.
[1:55:19] Parents, you have to have that backup.
[1:55:23] Don't let your children sleep away
[1:55:26] when they are still young because if
[1:55:28] they grow, you can't fight with them,
[1:55:32] they'll box you.
[1:55:35] Bend them when they still
[1:55:39] teach my children to pray.
[1:55:41] Any of my children,
[1:55:44] I don't care how old they are, they can
[1:55:46] pray for the home.
[1:55:49] And I do that on purpose. Today you are
[1:55:52] praying. Today you are praying. There
[1:55:54] you are. You learn how to pray when
[1:55:56] little.
[1:55:57] That is how we ought to do.
[1:56:00] We are raising a generation
[1:56:03] not of wayward people.
[1:56:05] It is our it is our duty
[1:56:09] as as as believers to raise a generation
[1:56:13] which will serve our God.
[1:56:16] Amen. And I now I've taken more than 30
[1:56:20] minutes almost talking about that.
[1:56:22] But now for an hour, help me to preach
[1:56:25] to you here
[1:56:28] on what the Lord laid on my heart. That
[1:56:30] one was a bonus. It didn't I did not
[1:56:32] prepare for it. It just came.
[1:56:37] Amen.
[1:56:39] And to those of you who felt bad,
[1:56:42] I'm very sorry. Please forgive me for
[1:56:45] making you to feel bad.
[1:56:48] But I don't apologize for what I said
[1:56:51] because it is the word of God.
[1:56:54] To him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:56:56] sit with me in my throne
[1:57:00] even as I overcame
[1:57:03] and I sat with my father in.
[1:57:06] So now listen our true origin.
[1:57:12] If you know who you are, if you know
[1:57:15] where you came from,
[1:57:17] you will know who Jesus is and where he
[1:57:20] came from and why he came. Jesus came to
[1:57:24] the earth
[1:57:26] to overcome.
[1:57:28] He knew he had to overcome
[1:57:31] because by prophecy,
[1:57:34] by divine knowledge,
[1:57:39] he was born into the world
[1:57:42] to overcome the world.
[1:57:45] He did not come into the world to be
[1:57:48] overcome by the world.
[1:57:51] The world even our generation
[1:57:54] has a lot of pressures
[1:57:57] and all of us are born defeated.
[1:58:00] We are all born
[1:58:02] overcome
[1:58:05] but we are born to overcome.
[1:58:09] We are born to live above the prison of
[1:58:13] the flesh.
[1:58:17] Let let me put it this way. Amen. You
[1:58:20] need to wash that child, please. She
[1:58:21] keeps he keeps throwing the bottle
[1:58:22] around. So listen, you know, we are born
[1:58:25] into this world
[1:58:27] to to to conquer.
[1:58:31] Amen. To conquer. Everybody say conquer.
[1:58:36] Brother, I'm happy to see. Amen. Oh,
[1:58:40] Sister Ruth, God bless you. Hallelujah.
[1:58:43] We are born in the world to conquer.
[1:58:47] Tell your neighbor, you are born to
[1:58:48] conquer.
[1:58:51] Conquer is a good thing
[1:58:54] but it is not easy because if you are
[1:58:57] going to conquer
[1:58:59] you cannot conquer without fighting.
[1:59:03] You cannot conquer without a battle.
[1:59:06] There has to be a declaration of war
[1:59:10] and then men go to battle.
[1:59:13] So we are here to battle. But you see
[1:59:16] there are some who are going to be
[1:59:18] defeated.
[1:59:19] There are some who going to fall by the
[1:59:22] sword of the power of darkness. But
[1:59:25] there are also some that are going to
[1:59:28] overcome.
[1:59:29] There are some who are going to conquer.
[1:59:32] Others are conquered by the sea.
[1:59:35] Others are conquered by the devil.
[1:59:38] In the way they think, in the way they
[1:59:41] live their lives, in the way they they
[1:59:44] they dress, in the way they talk, in the
[1:59:47] way they live generally. You can clearly
[1:59:50] see they are content.
[1:59:54] The Bible says they are listen. The
[1:59:58] Bible says they are blind.
[2:00:00] Amen. It's 12. I'm getting done by one.
[2:00:03] So follow me closely.
[2:00:05] Follow me closely here. I know I will
[2:00:07] not be done
[2:00:09] but I'm going to finish by one and you
[2:00:12] know me I'm a very good time keeper.
[2:00:14] Is that not so? All right. So when we
[2:00:18] talk about
[2:00:21] we are talking about people who are
[2:00:24] blind,
[2:00:26] people who are wretched,
[2:00:28] people who are miserable,
[2:00:31] people who are naked.
[2:00:34] Imagine, imagine somebody who is
[2:00:37] wretched,
[2:00:38] someone who is blind,
[2:00:41] someone who is poor,
[2:00:44] someone who is um you know naked
[2:00:49] but he doesn't know.
[2:00:52] That is the situation of our age.
[2:00:56] That's the situation of our age.
[2:00:59] We deal with these people every day.
[2:01:03] They feel they don't have what you have.
[2:01:08] They don't need it.
[2:01:11] They they will tell you they are perfect
[2:01:13] the way they are.
[2:01:16] They will tell you to acquire what you
[2:01:19] have
[2:01:20] and to live in it is to live in a
[2:01:23] bubble.
[2:01:27] It is not real.
[2:01:30] It is faking.
[2:01:32] Are you following me? They will try to
[2:01:35] show you. You are a loser.
[2:01:39] They will try to show you that you are a
[2:01:41] failure. You are a fool. You are
[2:01:45] brainwashed.
[2:01:48] That's what they say. But I have a
[2:01:50] question for them. If it is not this
[2:01:53] life,
[2:01:54] then what life is better?
[2:01:59] If it is not the life of the world,
[2:02:02] Show me a better life.
[2:02:04] Let me tell you, there is no better life
[2:02:08] than the life of the word of God.
[2:02:12] There is no better life. I don't care
[2:02:15] whether you have a lot of money
[2:02:18] or whether you are so poor.
[2:02:20] But what matters in this life
[2:02:23] is what will matter after this life.
[2:02:27] Hallelujah.
[2:02:29] Anything
[2:02:33] that does not matter in that life
[2:02:38] does not matter in this life.
[2:02:40] [Music]
[2:02:42] Hallelujah.
[2:02:45] What matters in this life
[2:02:48] is what matters in the other life.
[2:02:53] That is why saints we must know our true
[2:02:57] origin.
[2:03:01] We must know where we came from so that
[2:03:04] we can know where we are going.
[2:03:07] If they tell you you came from
[2:03:09] Australia, Australia and you are an
[2:03:11] Australian,
[2:03:13] even if you have a black skin,
[2:03:16] if DNA tells you you're Australian
[2:03:20] and you have a right maybe to claim your
[2:03:22] citizenship
[2:03:25] and you know that's your true origin.
[2:03:28] That's why you are going back. Friend,
[2:03:31] it doesn't matter what is around you. It
[2:03:34] doesn't matter what you see about
[2:03:35] yourself.
[2:03:37] You will begin planning to go to
[2:03:39] Australia. You will begin planning to
[2:03:43] live the way they live there.
[2:03:46] Hallelujah.
[2:03:48] Amen. Have you seen the people who are
[2:03:51] looking for visas?
[2:03:54] Let me tell you something. The reason
[2:03:56] why many of them get heartbroken,
[2:04:01] they can even some of them can even take
[2:04:04] their life.
[2:04:06] is because if they have a dream
[2:04:09] of going to America
[2:04:11] and they go before the visa officer
[2:04:14] and the visa officer says you don't
[2:04:16] qualify for the visa visa the person can
[2:04:21] go away
[2:04:22] and they can even die why because when
[2:04:26] they in the process of applying for a
[2:04:28] visa
[2:04:31] they in Uganda but they don't feel they
[2:04:34] in Uganda
[2:04:36] They don't see they're in Uganda.
[2:04:38] They don't they don't even, you know,
[2:04:41] speak as if they're in Uganda.
[2:04:43] They will even begin, you know, has
[2:04:45] already
[2:04:48] because they think they're going to.
[2:04:52] Have you seen some of those people
[2:04:53] planning to go abroad?
[2:04:55] Maybe they have even never been in an
[2:04:56] airplane before,
[2:04:58] but they will begin talking as if they
[2:05:00] have been in those countries.
[2:05:04] Why? Because they now know they are
[2:05:08] going to go abroad.
[2:05:10] So they now know that where they going
[2:05:12] to go
[2:05:14] and they believe that's where they come
[2:05:15] from and that's where they going to go
[2:05:18] back. They begin behaving like the
[2:05:20] people there
[2:05:22] and their dream is to go to America.
[2:05:25] Our dream, my dream is not to go to
[2:05:28] America.
[2:05:30] It's not to live in America. There's a
[2:05:32] better land. My dream is to go back to
[2:05:36] God because I came from God. I am going
[2:05:40] to go back to God.
[2:05:42] Hallelujah.
[2:05:44] Some people love those countries so
[2:05:45] much.
[2:05:47] But I tell you, I've been in some of
[2:05:48] them.
[2:05:50] Well, the people there are really
[2:05:51] wonderful,
[2:05:53] but there's no I've not seen honestly
[2:05:55] speaking
[2:05:56] a better country
[2:05:59] than Uganda. Uganda in many ways but
[2:06:03] today that's not my sermon
[2:06:05] my sermon I'm talking about another
[2:06:07] country which is better than Uganda
[2:06:10] Uganda which is better than America
[2:06:12] which is better than all these countries
[2:06:14] that's the country where I am going so
[2:06:17] therefore I am not defined by what I
[2:06:21] what is around me now
[2:06:26] maybe you see a lot of things that look
[2:06:28] like you are going to be defeated
[2:06:32] You have a lot of debts and you're poor
[2:06:35] and you know you have a lot of
[2:06:36] encumbrances
[2:06:39] sin that is miss you and many times we
[2:06:42] look at those situations
[2:06:44] and we fail to see where we are going
[2:06:47] but rather let us lift up our eyes. Let
[2:06:51] us begin to see ourselves
[2:06:53] as citizens of another country.
[2:06:56] Let us begin to see ourselves.
[2:06:59] Amen. With our new bodies.
[2:07:02] Let us begin talking as if we already
[2:07:04] have our new body.
[2:07:07] Let us begin thinking as if we have
[2:07:09] already overcome the flesh. Let us begin
[2:07:12] seeing. What others are not saying. Why?
[2:07:16] Because that's where we are going. Our
[2:07:18] true origin
[2:07:20] has already been revealed to us.
[2:07:24] We now know who we are.
[2:07:26] We know we are not Ugandan. We know we
[2:07:28] are not African. We know we are not even
[2:07:31] people in this earth.
[2:07:34] Amen. That's why the Bible say a man is
[2:07:37] in Christ.
[2:07:39] What does it say? He says in seated
[2:07:42] in heavenly places
[2:07:45] even if you're still here but
[2:07:48] spiritually speaking you are in another
[2:07:50] dimension.
[2:07:52] You don't operate in this dimension.
[2:07:55] You operate in another dimension.
[2:07:58] Forget about your problem.
[2:08:03] Amen. How am I able to live?
[2:08:07] I live by forgetting my problems.
[2:08:12] Let me tell you friends, if I am going
[2:08:15] to talk about my problems,
[2:08:17] I cannot even preach to you this
[2:08:19] morning.
[2:08:21] If you are going to overcome the world,
[2:08:25] you have to go beyond your problems,
[2:08:29] you have to think beyond your problem.
[2:08:32] You have to look at the promises
[2:08:35] of the place where you came from and the
[2:08:38] place where you are going.
[2:08:41] That's how we are able to overcome.
[2:08:44] Amen. When you receive a true identity
[2:08:49] of a son, then you begin to behave.
[2:08:52] Amen. Like you have already overcome.
[2:08:57] Hallelujah. The Bible says Jesus
[2:08:59] overcame.
[2:09:01] Jesus conquered. And now he sat down
[2:09:04] with his father
[2:09:06] in his throne. And now he says to him
[2:09:10] that will overcome
[2:09:12] to him that will overcome. Who is that?
[2:09:15] Oh, that is me. That's me. To him that
[2:09:19] will, he will sit down with Jesus in his
[2:09:25] throne. Amen. Yes, sir. Where are you
[2:09:29] going to be?
[2:09:31] You are going to be seated down with God
[2:09:33] himself
[2:09:36] because Jesus is sat on the throne of
[2:09:39] his father.
[2:09:40] That means you will sit down with Jesus.
[2:09:44] Hallelujah. That means you will sit down
[2:09:47] with the father.
[2:09:51] You are going to have
[2:09:53] the same original
[2:09:55] authority
[2:09:58] that you had lost before.
[2:10:02] There are many things I have to say this
[2:10:04] morning.
[2:10:05] Pray for me. Let me first remove this
[2:10:07] jacket.
[2:10:11] that I may be free so I don't get
[2:10:13] limited.
[2:10:15] Matthew 16,
[2:10:17] we read this sometime.
[2:10:19] He says, I say unto thee that thou art
[2:10:22] Peter and upon this rock I will build my
[2:10:27] church
[2:10:30] and the gates of hell
[2:10:33] will not prevail against it. What does
[2:10:36] that mean? Oh my. Those who are behind,
[2:10:39] are you following?
[2:10:41] Amen. Brother Peter, God bless you. I
[2:10:44] want to keep seeing you saying amen.
[2:10:47] Don't just be quiet.
[2:10:49] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:10:53] Hallelujah. All right. Yes, sir. Now,
[2:10:56] the Bible here is talking about um the
[2:10:59] church.
[2:11:01] Amen. The build upon the revelation of
[2:11:03] who Christ is.
[2:11:05] But here's the portion I wanted to throw
[2:11:06] this out. and the gates of hell
[2:11:10] shall not prevail against you. So let me
[2:11:14] ask you sister for what does this mean?
[2:11:18] It means the gates of hell would be
[2:11:21] against you.
[2:11:26] Pastor pray for me problems after
[2:11:28] problem. I don't know what is wrong with
[2:11:30] me. Maybe I was even bewitched. Maybe
[2:11:33] there is someone be I have no peace. Not
[2:11:37] none of my things move
[2:11:40] every day. I have problems here. So who
[2:11:43] is not like that?
[2:11:45] But let me tell you brother, I will be
[2:11:48] shocked.
[2:11:50] I will be surprised if you don't have
[2:11:53] problems.
[2:11:57] I will be shocked if you have no
[2:11:59] problem. If you have no trouble, if you
[2:12:02] have no issue because the church will
[2:12:07] have all g of
[2:12:13] Amen. Amen. One of the vindication
[2:12:17] that you are the bride of Christ.
[2:12:20] All hell will be done loose on you.
[2:12:25] All hell will be done loose on you.
[2:12:29] Pastor proof.
[2:12:31] You are the church. Pastor my body.
[2:12:35] I am suffering with lust. I'm suffering
[2:12:38] with this issue. Even poverty, no school
[2:12:41] fear. No one likes me. Everybody's
[2:12:44] talking about no job. I don't know what
[2:12:48] is happening. Outside I go. I'm having
[2:12:51] an issue. I am tired of the life. I want
[2:12:54] to die. No, you don't want to die. You
[2:12:58] want to go back where you came from.
[2:13:02] Hallelujah. That's what you should know.
[2:13:05] You don't want to die. You want to
[2:13:08] leave.
[2:13:09] That's what Paul says. Oh wretched body,
[2:13:14] wretched man that I am. This body is
[2:13:17] wretched. In this life we grown. Why are
[2:13:21] we seeking?
[2:13:23] We are seeking to be clothed upon with
[2:13:27] another body.
[2:13:29] Amen. Amen. So let me tell you because
[2:13:32] all hell is against you,
[2:13:35] it proves
[2:13:37] you are a child of God.
[2:13:41] Hallelujah.
[2:13:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because I'm
[2:13:46] coughing,
[2:13:48] it proves I'm a child of God.
[2:13:51] But if I looked at my cough and I said
[2:13:54] I'll not preach, it means I'm looking at
[2:13:56] my situation.
[2:14:00] Pastor is coughing.
[2:14:03] So what
[2:14:06] is a human being
[2:14:08] who is looking beyond
[2:14:11] You're coughing.
[2:14:14] One day I'm going to be in a body
[2:14:17] that cannot be touched
[2:14:19] by anything in this world.
[2:14:24] What are you going through, brother?
[2:14:26] Are things okay?
[2:14:29] I don't know how things are with you,
[2:14:31] but I tell you what, one time somebody
[2:14:34] told me, someone who has known a few
[2:14:36] things have gone through
[2:14:38] a pastor, you are really a son of God
[2:14:42] because some of those things
[2:14:45] to see what you are now. Let me tell
[2:14:48] you, I can tell you the same thing right
[2:14:50] now. Amen. to see who you are now.
[2:14:55] I may not know but God knows and the
[2:14:58] devil knows what you have gone through
[2:15:01] and has not killed you and you are here.
[2:15:04] The devil knows for sure, you know, and
[2:15:07] God knows. That's why he's speaking to
[2:15:09] you this morning. The fact that you
[2:15:12] didn't die,
[2:15:16] the fact that you didn't fall away,
[2:15:19] there is something the devil did.
[2:15:22] Oh, brother Paul, there is something the
[2:15:25] devil did. And he said with this one,
[2:15:30] I am going to finish him.
[2:15:33] I am going to finish him. They will you
[2:15:36] know there is an accident that can
[2:15:37] happen
[2:15:39] and they will not even find your body.
[2:15:42] The devil said with this one they will
[2:15:44] not even be able to recognize him. But
[2:15:47] let me tell you and let me tell the
[2:15:49] devil you are here because all hell
[2:15:55] cannot prevail
[2:15:58] against you.
[2:16:00] All hell will
[2:16:02] all hell will try but it will not
[2:16:05] prevail you.
[2:16:07] Why? Because you are born
[2:16:11] to be an overcomer.
[2:16:14] You are born to live above
[2:16:18] a sin that easily be.
[2:16:22] When your husband left you,
[2:16:25] you thought you're finished.
[2:16:29] Even in families there are things that
[2:16:31] can happen until you say God I'm
[2:16:34] finished but you are here today you are
[2:16:37] not why are you not finished because you
[2:16:39] are born to overcome
[2:16:42] there are things that cannot defeat the
[2:16:45] child of God
[2:16:47] and there are some which must happen
[2:16:50] so that the devil can be proven
[2:16:54] that this one is overcoming pro is proof
[2:16:58] not to be overcome.
[2:17:03] There are things Jesus, the devil did to
[2:17:05] Jesus
[2:17:07] that he said with this one for sure I
[2:17:09] will finish him. And they took Jesus and
[2:17:13] they begin beating him. They begin
[2:17:15] beating him. They began beating him,
[2:17:17] brother. They beat him and beat him and
[2:17:19] beat him. But with all those stripes,
[2:17:23] the devil didn't know
[2:17:26] that he was purchasing our healing.
[2:17:29] Hallelujah.
[2:17:33] Amen. With every beating he received, it
[2:17:36] was healing for you. Healing for you.
[2:17:40] Healing for you. Healing for you. And
[2:17:42] the devil saw his overcoming healing.
[2:17:46] But he did not know through the things
[2:17:48] Christ suffered,
[2:17:51] he overcame
[2:17:53] not only for himself but for you too.
[2:17:58] Hallelujah. Amen. That's why he's more
[2:18:00] than a conqueror.
[2:18:03] We are more than
[2:18:05] [Applause]
[2:18:07] Now let me take talk about something.
[2:18:11] Let me talk about living a life of sin.
[2:18:16] Did you know you had no choice?
[2:18:21] You found yourself in this flesh.
[2:18:23] [Music]
[2:18:25] Therefore, the things you love to do.
[2:18:28] Your soul hurts.
[2:18:33] But your body, your flesh loves.
[2:18:36] Now, let me talk to you.
[2:18:38] You are born to overcome the thing your
[2:18:41] flesh loves.
[2:18:46] There are a people who will agree
[2:18:50] with the flesh
[2:18:54] and they will say I am born this way.
[2:18:58] I can't fight myself.
[2:19:00] Have you heard about those people?
[2:19:07] I can't fight myself.
[2:19:09] And you you see a woman he begins to say
[2:19:16] me I'm I'm a man even if I have a
[2:19:19] woman's body
[2:19:22] I was born this way because of the
[2:19:24] feeling because of the feeling
[2:19:28] I was born this way and they are there
[2:19:31] and they agree with the devil
[2:19:34] and the Bible says they become reprobate
[2:19:38] It's right in the Bible.
[2:19:41] Oh my I wish I had time. I wish I had
[2:19:43] time to get into all these details.
[2:19:46] But but I just feel a nudge of the Holy
[2:19:49] Ghost
[2:19:50] to go a little bit on this.
[2:19:53] For the wrath of God is revealed from
[2:19:56] heaven against all ungodliness
[2:20:00] and unrighteousness of men who hold the
[2:20:04] truth
[2:20:05] in unrighteousness.
[2:20:08] Because that which may be known of God
[2:20:12] is manifest in them.
[2:20:16] For God has showed it unto them. But the
[2:20:19] invisible things hid from the creation
[2:20:21] of the world are clearly seen be being
[2:20:24] understood by the things that are made.
[2:20:31] Uh-huh. 21 Because that when they knew
[2:20:34] God,
[2:20:36] they glorified him not as God,
[2:20:39] neither were thankful,
[2:20:41] but became vain
[2:20:45] in their imaginations,
[2:20:48] and their foolish hearts
[2:20:51] was darkened,
[2:20:55] professing themselves
[2:20:58] to be wise, they became fools.
[2:21:02] And they change the glory
[2:21:05] of the uncorruptible God
[2:21:08] into an image made like to corruptible
[2:21:10] man.
[2:21:15] 24.
[2:21:16] Wherefore, God also gave them up.
[2:21:22] These are people that refuse to believe
[2:21:24] they can overcome.
[2:21:30] They changed the glory of God
[2:21:33] into the image of a man.
[2:21:37] What did God do? He gave them up to
[2:21:41] uncleanness
[2:21:43] through the lust of their own hearts
[2:21:47] to dishonor their own bodies
[2:21:51] between themselves.
[2:21:53] who turned the truth of God into a lie
[2:21:57] and they worshiped and served the
[2:21:59] creature more than the creator
[2:22:03] for this cause. Are you following me
[2:22:06] church? God gave them up
[2:22:09] and vile affections
[2:22:14] for vile affections.
[2:22:21] For even their women did change the
[2:22:23] natural use into that which is against
[2:22:25] nature.
[2:22:30] He's talking about lesbians here.
[2:22:33] And likewise also the men living the
[2:22:35] natural use of the woman bing their lust
[2:22:38] one toward another
[2:22:42] men with men working that which is
[2:22:45] unseemly
[2:22:46] and receiving in themselves that
[2:22:48] recompense of their error within.
[2:22:52] And here's the wrath of God. And even as
[2:22:55] they did not retain God in their
[2:22:57] knowledge,
[2:23:01] which means if they retain God in their
[2:23:04] knowledge,
[2:23:06] they would overcome.
[2:23:08] But they disregarded God
[2:23:11] and they listened to their feelings and
[2:23:14] they lifted up beyond God.
[2:23:18] Your feelings is not greater than God.
[2:23:24] Listen, because they did not retain God
[2:23:26] in their knowledge.
[2:23:30] God don't say this, preach it. God gave
[2:23:34] them over to a reprobate man.
[2:23:40] A reprobate man
[2:23:44] to do those things which are not
[2:23:46] convenient.
[2:23:48] being filled with all unrighteousness,
[2:23:53] fornication.
[2:23:56] Did you know you can overcome
[2:23:58] forication?
[2:24:02] But these people,
[2:24:04] you know, all these demons,
[2:24:07] sexual demons
[2:24:09] overcome them because they did not
[2:24:12] retain God in their anointing.
[2:24:16] wickedness,
[2:24:18] cociousness,
[2:24:20] maliciousness,
[2:24:21] full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
[2:24:27] whisperers, backbiters, haters of God,
[2:24:31] despiteful, proud, bastards,
[2:24:35] inventors of evil things,
[2:24:37] disobedient to parents,
[2:24:42] without understanding,
[2:24:44] covenant breakers without natural
[2:24:47] affection,
[2:24:49] implacable and merciful,
[2:24:52] who knowing the judgment of God,
[2:24:57] that they wish commit such things
[2:25:02] that they they that they know that they
[2:25:05] that commit such things are worthy of
[2:25:07] death.
[2:25:10] not only do the same,
[2:25:13] but also them
[2:25:15] that have pleasure in those that do
[2:25:17] them.
[2:25:23] I don't believe in fornication,
[2:25:25] but I will help you and you
[2:25:28] don't believe in doing
[2:25:31] a way.
[2:25:37] I'm not going to support you. I'm not
[2:25:39] going to rejoice with you.
[2:25:41] I'm going to tell you
[2:25:43] where we separate we shall separate
[2:25:47] stand with the word
[2:25:49] now.
[2:25:51] I am preaching to those people who
[2:25:54] believe they can overcome.
[2:25:58] If you retain God in your knowledge,
[2:26:02] you are born to overcome.
[2:26:05] You are born to overcome. You are born
[2:26:08] to live above those feelings.
[2:26:11] Oh God, why do I have this feeling in my
[2:26:14] body?
[2:26:16] Because God wants you to overcome.
[2:26:21] God wants you to live a bad
[2:26:25] after we have overcome.
[2:26:27] Oh, after we have overcome, we can all
[2:26:30] gather together and we will sing a new
[2:26:33] song.
[2:26:35] Oh, when the battle is over, we shall
[2:26:38] weigh a crown. We shall wear a crown. We
[2:26:42] shall wear a crown. When
[2:26:45] Oh, we
[2:26:48] listen.
[2:26:50] Listen. We are going to wear that
[2:26:54] because we are the overcomers.
[2:26:57] Hallelujah. Don't feel sorry
[2:27:01] of you because you're fighting.
[2:27:04] Let me tell you, stop. Quit looking at
[2:27:07] yourself.
[2:27:09] Amen. You are being defeated
[2:27:12] because you look at yourself too much,
[2:27:17] sister, brother. Look at God.
[2:27:22] He has the power to make it work out. He
[2:27:26] has the power to help you overcome the
[2:27:29] world.
[2:27:31] And then when you overcome, You are
[2:27:34] going to be a ruler.
[2:27:36] Hallelujah. You're going to be a king
[2:27:39] and a priest. Let me tell you something.
[2:27:43] Your overcoming
[2:27:45] is not coming in the future.
[2:27:47] Your overcoming
[2:27:49] begins here.
[2:27:51] It begins here. Amen.
[2:27:56] They that overcome,
[2:27:58] they will sit with Christ on his throne.
[2:28:02] Where is the throne? The throne is here.
[2:28:05] The throne of power, the throne of
[2:28:07] holiness, the throne of grace.
[2:28:10] Hallelujah. Amen. You will sit with him
[2:28:13] when you overcome the flesh. And the
[2:28:15] Bible says, you shall be a king and you
[2:28:19] shall be a priest. Why? Because of the
[2:28:22] redeemer.
[2:28:25] A king. What? King
[2:28:28] ruling
[2:28:30] over every other demon.
[2:28:35] Ruling over the demons of the world,
[2:28:38] the demons of deceit,
[2:28:40] the demons of worldliness,
[2:28:47] living a Christian life.
[2:28:50] What are you doing? You are a king. In
[2:28:54] whose domain? in God's domain.
[2:28:58] We are spiritual kings now.
[2:29:01] We are spiritual kings now.
[2:29:04] Do not allow any other dominion
[2:29:07] to rule over you. Do not permit any
[2:29:11] other dominion
[2:29:13] to rule over you. We are priests
[2:29:17] giving spiritual sacrifices
[2:29:20] of our
[2:29:21] lips and hands
[2:29:24] worshiping God.
[2:29:26] That's why you're clapping your hand.
[2:29:28] That's why you're saying hallelujah
[2:29:30] because you're a priest.
[2:29:34] Your life is being waved before the
[2:29:37] world as an example. Am I preaching to
[2:29:41] someone this morning?
[2:29:43] You are a king now. You are a spiritual
[2:29:46] kingdom.
[2:29:47] But time is coming. Time is coming where
[2:29:51] you are going to be a physical king.
[2:29:54] [Applause]
[2:29:57] Amen. The saints will rule the world.
[2:30:03] The saints of the Lord shall take the
[2:30:05] kingdom. Shall take the kingdom. Shall
[2:30:09] take the kingdom.
[2:30:12] The saints of the Lord shall take the
[2:30:14] kingdom and reign forever more.
[2:30:20] Amen. When I say we know no defeat, you
[2:30:23] say hallelujah.
[2:30:27] We know no defeat. We know no defeat.
[2:30:32] Jesus is the captain no defeat. We win
[2:30:36] all the
[2:30:39] defeat. Jesus is the cupcake.
[2:30:48] Jesus.
[2:30:52] Come on, give the Lord a praise.
[2:30:57] I tell you what, friends,
[2:31:00] we are living in that hour
[2:31:02] where we are about
[2:31:05] to switch dimensions.
[2:31:08] When we see the events that are
[2:31:10] happening in the world,
[2:31:13] we see clearly
[2:31:15] it's just about home time
[2:31:21] who loves the world.
[2:31:25] But there are some of us
[2:31:28] preparing to overcome completely.
[2:31:32] Amen.
[2:31:34] I have 8 minutes. Listen,
[2:31:37] I'm guessing the opening scripture.
[2:31:40] You see, the hail gates of hell shall
[2:31:44] not prevail against it. We are Abraham's
[2:31:47] seed.
[2:31:49] That means we too must possess the gates
[2:31:51] of our enemy
[2:31:53] because the promise to Abraham was your
[2:31:55] seed shall possess the gates of our
[2:31:59] enemy.
[2:32:01] We are the seed of Abraham. I am born to
[2:32:05] possess over the king. Amen. Amen. I am
[2:32:08] born to possess the gifts of sadness.
[2:32:12] Amen. The gifts of sadness, the G of
[2:32:15] sickness, the gifts of problems, the
[2:32:18] gifts of fear, the gifts of sin. Amen.
[2:32:22] Again of evil,
[2:32:24] of fornication,
[2:32:26] amen, of lasciviousness.
[2:32:28] I am born to possess every gift.
[2:32:32] the gates of poverty.
[2:32:35] My mind must be changed.
[2:32:38] I am born to possess these gifts.
[2:32:42] Listen, listen, church. I am not just
[2:32:45] preaching to you a good Sunday morning
[2:32:47] service.
[2:32:49] I am declaring to you
[2:32:52] the word of God.
[2:32:55] You can choose to believe it
[2:32:57] and you'll be changed or you can remain
[2:33:00] the way you are.
[2:33:06] Hallelujah. We are here to overcome.
[2:33:11] Tell your neighbor you are here to you
[2:33:14] are here to overcome. Tell them until
[2:33:17] they believe it. Come on, somebody tell
[2:33:19] your neighbor. Don't just be quiet.
[2:33:25] Tell your neighbor.
[2:33:27] If you're not telling your name, it
[2:33:28] means you already.
[2:33:33] Hallelujah.
[2:33:36] I am here to overcome.
[2:33:39] I must live above.
[2:33:42] Amen. Amen. I must sit with Christ
[2:33:47] in his throne. I refuse to be a
[2:33:54] refuse.
[2:33:58] bound to rule.
[2:34:01] [Music]
[2:34:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir.
[2:34:10] Remember we are the pure beaten work of
[2:34:14] God.
[2:34:18] Now, now seven golden candlesticks.
[2:34:22] Amen. And he says Exodus 25:31
[2:34:26] And thou shalt make a candlestick
[2:34:30] of pure gold
[2:34:32] of work shall the candlestick be made.
[2:34:41] Let me read it again, brother. Trust
[2:34:43] yourself. You can get it. And thou shalt
[2:34:45] make a candlestick of pure gold.
[2:34:50] Of beaten work shall the candlestick be
[2:34:52] made. His
[2:34:57] shaft and his branches, his bowels and
[2:34:59] his kn and his flowers shall be of the
[2:35:01] same.
[2:35:07] But the Bible says the true church of
[2:35:08] Jesus,
[2:35:10] the bride is likened to pure gold.
[2:35:16] Her righteousness,
[2:35:19] the true church
[2:35:21] is pure gold. Okay. The true church is
[2:35:25] equals to pure God.
[2:35:29] Are you following me? What does that
[2:35:31] mean? Our righteousness
[2:35:34] is his righteousness.
[2:35:41] Some of you have not had it.
[2:35:46] His righteousness,
[2:35:49] your righteousness
[2:35:51] is his righteousness.
[2:35:54] Hallelujah.
[2:35:57] Even if you think you're already in in a
[2:35:59] defeated life,
[2:36:03] just hear the word.
[2:36:05] When you hear the word, receive it,
[2:36:08] accept it. And you know what? Before you
[2:36:11] know it, you will realize you are the
[2:36:14] righteousness of God.
[2:36:16] It has happened.
[2:36:18] How does it happen? There's nothing you
[2:36:21] have to do.
[2:36:23] only believe.
[2:36:27] You only have to believe it.
[2:36:31] That's why you must say amen whether you
[2:36:33] feel you have realized it or not yet.
[2:36:37] Amen. You have attained it or not.
[2:36:40] Just believe it. Her righteousness is
[2:36:43] his righteousness.
[2:36:45] Her attributes are his own glorious
[2:36:48] attributes.
[2:36:52] Now listen to this part. Amen. Amen.
[2:36:56] Amen. Her identity
[2:37:01] identity
[2:37:03] found in him in Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:37:11] Hallelujah.
[2:37:13] What he is.
[2:37:16] What he is. as she is to reflect
[2:37:22] what he has.
[2:37:25] She is to manifest.
[2:37:28] [Music]
[2:37:28] [Applause]
[2:37:30] So if what you have
[2:37:33] is not what he has, don't you worry. You
[2:37:37] must manifest what he has
[2:37:42] from beginning to ending.
[2:37:45] She is the work of our Lord.
[2:37:49] And all his works are perfect.
[2:37:52] In fact, in her
[2:37:55] is summed up and manifested the eternal
[2:37:58] wisdom and purpose of God.
[2:38:08] How can one fathom it?
[2:38:12] How can one understand it?
[2:38:14] We cannot understand it.
[2:38:17] can accept it by praise.
[2:38:20] So God has spoken.
[2:38:24] Hallelujah.
[2:38:26] Amen. Amen. Let me rehearse this a
[2:38:29] little bit. Amen. For me, I see how I
[2:38:33] will feel. You can rehearse it for you.
[2:38:37] My righteousness. My righteousness
[2:38:40] is his righteousness. My attributes are
[2:38:43] his own various attributes. My identity
[2:38:47] is found in Christ. What I what Christ
[2:38:50] is I am to reflect it. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:38:55] What he Christ has to manifest. Amen.
[2:39:00] There is no fault in me.
[2:39:02] There is no fault in me. Fault.
[2:39:06] F.
[2:39:17] There is no fault in me. Hallelujah.
[2:39:23] Brotherhu
[2:39:27] will take away your word
[2:39:32] there is no fault.
[2:39:34] Amen. Hallelujah. I am I am all glorious
[2:39:40] within.
[2:39:44] and without.
[2:39:46] So when you see me, you see the glory of
[2:39:50] God,
[2:39:51] I am glorious within and without.
[2:39:57] Hallelujah. Amen. From beginning to end,
[2:40:02] I am the work of my Lord
[2:40:05] and all his works.
[2:40:11] Now you know why he says he's coming for
[2:40:13] a perfect
[2:40:15] without
[2:40:20] is someone getting revelation
[2:40:24] though I cannot understand it
[2:40:28] I can accept it by faith
[2:40:32] God has seen it God has spoken
[2:40:36] I believe it
[2:40:39] now let me get you to the second
[2:40:43] Not only are you a candlestick of gold,
[2:40:47] you are a candlestick of beaten gold.
[2:40:56] Handcrafted of beaten gold.
[2:41:02] According of beaten gold.
[2:41:06] according to her blueprints which were
[2:41:09] given spirit given
[2:41:14] outside of your Lord and Master Jesus
[2:41:17] Christ.
[2:41:18] [Music]
[2:41:20] There has never been a people so beaten
[2:41:22] and purged as the bride of Christ.
[2:41:29] Surely she is filling up the suffering.
[2:41:34] She she she's filling up the sufferings
[2:41:36] of Christ.
[2:41:38] Yes. That he left behind.
[2:41:44] Her goods are plundered.
[2:41:49] Her life is in geopy.
[2:41:53] She is accounted as sheep for the
[2:41:55] slaughter.
[2:41:58] She's killed all the day long.
[2:42:01] She suffers much.
[2:42:03] If you can say it's me, Lord,
[2:42:06] Lord, does me
[2:42:09] she suffers much,
[2:42:12] but in it all
[2:42:14] retaliates not.
[2:42:18] Neither does she cause others to suffer.
[2:42:22] Worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[2:42:25] bride of Christ.
[2:42:28] And as gold is malleable,
[2:42:32] whereas brush will break with a beating.
[2:42:48] This God of God
[2:42:51] will bear her suffering for the Lord.
[2:42:59] This gold of God, this gold of God
[2:43:05] will bear her suffering for the Lord.
[2:43:09] I am the God of God.
[2:43:14] I am the God of God.
[2:43:18] Hallelujah. And I will bear the my
[2:43:20] suffering for my Lord.
[2:43:24] Not bowed, not bowed,
[2:43:28] not broken,
[2:43:30] not destroyed,
[2:43:33] but formed as a thing of beauty
[2:43:38] and joy forever
[2:43:41] by the trials and testings of this life.
[2:43:46] No, maybe I've been going through things
[2:43:49] in your life
[2:43:51] and until sometimes you said, "Lord,
[2:43:55] this is too much for me."
[2:43:59] Listen to me. I'm preaching to you this
[2:44:01] morning.
[2:44:04] It's not too much
[2:44:06] if you are the bride.
[2:44:08] It's not too much
[2:44:10] if you are the gold
[2:44:13] because it says you are not bound.
[2:44:18] You are not broken. You are not
[2:44:21] destroyed
[2:44:22] but you are formed as a thing of beauty
[2:44:28] by the trials and the sufferings of his

[2:44:33] How many are suffering?
[2:44:35] your sufferings.
[2:44:38] God, Amen. is making something
[2:44:40] beautiful.
[2:44:44] Hallelujah.
[2:44:46] You are God. Don't you worry.
[2:44:49] You will not break a break. You will not
[2:44:52] bow. You be deformed.
[2:44:56] God is forming in you. A thing of
[2:44:59] beauty.
[2:45:02] Amen. Amen. Now I know who I am.
[2:45:05] My beauty is found in him.
[2:45:08] Wherever he leaves me, I will go.
[2:45:11] Whatever happens to me, if it is his
[2:45:14] will, I will agree because I know he has
[2:45:19] a good plan for my life. I know I must
[2:45:23] overcome.
[2:45:25] Let suffering come. I will not fear
[2:45:29] because even though I walk through the
[2:45:30] valley of child of I will fear no evil.
[2:45:34] for you goeth before me.
[2:45:37] [Applause]
[2:45:38] Hallelujah.
[2:45:40] But the problem believers fear
[2:45:43] suffering.
[2:45:45] Believers fear problems.
[2:45:48] Don't you worry if you have problems.
[2:45:51] They are there to test you
[2:45:54] and mold you. Temptation is there to
[2:45:57] mold you.
[2:46:00] Don't fall to it.
[2:46:04] fall walk through it.
[2:46:10] He leadth me through the fire.
[2:46:15] He doesn't let the fire go,
[2:46:19] but I walk through it.
[2:46:22] He never promised that there won't be
[2:46:24] fire,
[2:46:27] but he promised to walk with me.
[2:46:33] You don't see them praying, "Oh, God,
[2:46:36] bring down the fire."
[2:46:40] No,
[2:46:41] but God was with them. And they knew it.
[2:46:45] They were ready to go and be burnt by
[2:46:49] the fire.
[2:46:51] But they know, Amen. If it is his will
[2:46:56] for us to burn, we will not bow. We will
[2:47:00] not bend.
[2:47:02] before bow we will stand strong
[2:47:08] when everybody's bowing.
[2:47:10] Let me tell you brother. Hey, listen to
[2:47:13] me sister.
[2:47:15] Don't bow before your problem.
[2:47:18] Don't bend for your problem.
[2:47:21] Don't be broken by your issues.
[2:47:25] Stand strong through here.
[2:47:28] See yourself as an overcomer.
[2:47:32] That's not me talking to you. That's the
[2:47:35] Holy Ghost.
[2:47:39] I'm speaking to you in the name of the
[2:47:40] Lord. Receive it. Don't deny it. Receive
[2:47:43] it. Accept it. Move through it.
[2:47:47] [Applause]
[2:47:48] Hallelujah. Don't burn before it. Burn
[2:47:52] through it
[2:47:54] because you are God.
[2:47:56] You are God. God does not burn through
[2:47:59] the fire.
[2:48:02] God is filtered by the fire.
[2:48:08] God is straightened by the fire.
[2:48:11] God cannot be vanquished by the fire.
[2:48:15] That's why God allows the fire to come
[2:48:17] to you
[2:48:19] because of who you are.
[2:48:22] Hallelujah.
[2:48:25] [Applause]
[2:48:28] No one else could go through what you
[2:48:30] are going through.
[2:48:34] Amen.
[2:48:36] God allows you to go through what you're
[2:48:38] going through
[2:48:40] because he trusts you can go through.
[2:48:45] He knows what you're made of.
[2:48:48] If you knew you are brass
[2:48:52] or aluminium,
[2:48:53] he would not have let you go through the
[2:48:54] fire.
[2:48:57] Aluminium will also
[2:49:02] but gold is gold.
[2:49:06] It go through the fire and is just made
[2:49:09] pure
[2:49:11] is beaten and made pure.
[2:49:14] Don't become bitter in your heart.
[2:49:18] Are you listening church?
[2:49:20] Don't become bitter in your heart.
[2:49:25] Don't become bitter.
[2:49:28] Many believers become bitter.
[2:49:30] When he become bitter, the Holy Spirit
[2:49:33] stops working.
[2:49:36] He is a sweet spirit.
[2:49:39] That's why when he comes over you, you
[2:49:41] just begin loving everyone,
[2:49:44] no enemies because of the Holy Spirit.
[2:49:49] Be sweet.
[2:49:51] Don't be embittered
[2:49:54] by the things you are going through in
[2:49:55] your life.
[2:49:58] the things you're going through in your
[2:49:59] life
[2:50:01] are only there to perfect you.
[2:50:04] Hallelujah.
[2:50:08] Now, in this 10 minutes, I want to read
[2:50:09] for you something here.
[2:50:12] In his own personal life,
[2:50:15] contending with himself is talking of
[2:50:17] Christ.
[2:50:21] That happens with us every day.
[2:50:25] contending with himself.
[2:50:29] He didn't want to go to the cross.
[2:50:32] Can you actually believe that
[2:50:36] he contended with himself?
[2:50:40] You are contending with yourself.
[2:50:44] He overcame.
[2:50:48] Hallelujah. How did he overcome?
[2:50:51] He overcame
[2:50:53] by obedience to the word of God.
[2:51:00] Hebrews 5:7.
[2:51:02] It says, and I had it marked out here. I
[2:51:05] have no time to read everything for you,
[2:51:08] but it says, praise the name of the
[2:51:10] Lord. Listen carefully now. Who in the
[2:51:13] days of his flesh?
[2:51:18] Hallelujah. who in the days of his flesh
[2:51:22] when he had offered up prayers
[2:51:26] and supplications
[2:51:28] with strong crying
[2:51:31] in tears
[2:51:33] unto him that was able
[2:51:37] to save him from death and was hard in
[2:51:41] that he feared.
[2:51:44] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. And
[2:51:47] listen, listen now. Though he was a son,
[2:51:52] yet learn obedience
[2:51:56] by the things which he suffered.
[2:51:59] Are you following me now? He learned
[2:52:02] obedience by the things which he
[2:52:03] suffered.
[2:52:06] And being made perfect,
[2:52:10] he became the author
[2:52:13] of eternal salvation.
[2:52:16] unto all them that obey him.
[2:52:24] The Bible says he became an high priest.
[2:52:25] Not he didn't make himself one.
[2:52:29] It is God who chooses a priest.
[2:52:32] He chose him to be a priest. You two are
[2:52:35] chosen.
[2:52:38] But he had to become obedient
[2:52:41] by the things which he suffered.
[2:52:44] What? Listen church. What was Christ
[2:52:47] obedient to?
[2:52:51] To the word of God.
[2:52:56] The things you are suffering
[2:52:58] will break you, mold you and make you
[2:53:01] obedient to the word.
[2:53:04] Now then there will not be one person
[2:53:06] who will sit in the throne of the Lord
[2:53:07] Jesus the Christ
[2:53:11] unless he has been living that word.
[2:53:17] Now I I'm going to read something which
[2:53:19] would shock you.
[2:53:22] Open your ears. Listen. Your prayers
[2:53:26] your fastings
[2:53:28] your repentances.
[2:53:30] No matter what you present to God,
[2:53:35] none of that will gain you the privilege
[2:53:37] of sitting in that throne.
[2:53:45] You see why we are not a denomination.
[2:53:50] You see why this is not just a
[2:53:52] Pentecostal.
[2:53:55] This is the message of the hour.
[2:53:58] We are not going to enter that throne
[2:54:02] by praying a lot of fasting alone by
[2:54:06] repenting day and night.
[2:54:10] We are going to sit in a throne by
[2:54:13] overcoming.
[2:54:14] And how are we going to overcome? We are
[2:54:17] going to overcome the sufferings we are
[2:54:18] going through.
[2:54:21] God allows it to come so that it can
[2:54:24] make us obedient to the word.
[2:54:29] And then it will be the word or nothing
[2:54:31] else.
[2:54:34] And when you are obedient to the word
[2:54:38] when you're obedient to the word, then
[2:54:40] you will see that.
[2:54:42] [Applause]
[2:54:44] Hallelujah. Obedience to the word bring
[2:54:48] everything you need.
[2:54:52] Full obedience.
[2:54:54] The full word of God will entitle you to
[2:54:57] the Holy Ghost.
[2:55:02] If you receive the full word
[2:55:04] and you obey it, you will receive the
[2:55:07] Holy Ghost.
[2:55:10] Hallelujah. So what you need in full
[2:55:13] obedience to the word,
[2:55:18] it will be granted.
[2:55:21] What will none of that will gain you the
[2:55:24] privilege of sitting in our throne?
[2:55:27] It will be granted only to the word
[2:55:29] bride. Word bride.
[2:55:34] That's why you have to feed on the word.
[2:55:38] Stop running around
[2:55:41] looking here and there hearing this and
[2:55:43] that. It's not my words you need.
[2:55:47] It's the word of the hour that you need.
[2:55:51] Get into the message. Get into the
[2:55:52] message. Feed on the message. Feed on it
[2:55:56] like as if you're dying tomorrow.
[2:56:00] Hallelujah. You must become a word.
[2:56:04] We must be a church that is on fire for
[2:56:07] God. A church that is feeding on the
[2:56:10] word.
[2:56:13] If you're feeding on the word, then
[2:56:15] you're going to be hungry
[2:56:18] for the coming of the Lord.
[2:56:20] hungry. Hey, listen to me for telling
[2:56:23] others what God is doing in this hour.
[2:56:29] [Music]
[2:56:31] It will be granted only to the word
[2:56:33] bride
[2:56:36] as the throne of the king is shared with
[2:56:38] the queen
[2:56:40] [Music]
[2:56:41] because she is united to him.
[2:56:46] So only they who are of the word even as
[2:56:49] he is of that word will share that
[2:56:52] throne.
[2:56:58] Hallelujah.
[2:57:01] Praying has its place. Fasting has it.
[2:57:04] Repentance has it.
[2:57:09] We should do all those things. Are you
[2:57:12] following me? But most importantly,
[2:57:16] feed on the word.
[2:57:20] Hallelujah.
[2:57:23] If you don't, I've done my job as your
[2:57:26] pastor.
[2:57:28] I've told you what you ought to do.
[2:57:30] Don't let it stop here. Go at home. Get
[2:57:34] the software.
[2:57:37] Start feeding on the word.
[2:57:39] Feed on the word. Read the Bible every
[2:57:42] day. Listen to the message every day.
[2:57:45] Have a family out in your home.
[2:57:48] Just be hungry for God.
[2:57:51] That throne.
[2:57:53] It's only for the word bride and him.
[2:57:56] Because the Bible says he the bride
[2:57:58] groom is the his name is called the word
[2:58:01] of God.
[2:58:06] They who are united with him only can
[2:58:08] sit on that throne.
[2:58:11] brother eat the word.
[2:58:14] Remember we have shown clearly
[2:58:17] all through ages the ages that even as
[2:58:20] Adam and Eve fell
[2:58:23] because they left the world.
[2:58:27] So even a fashion age
[2:58:30] fell by turning slightly from the word
[2:58:35] until with every age continuing to turn
[2:58:37] away.
[2:58:40] We have a final repudiation,
[2:58:44] a final rejection of the world
[2:58:47] by the world church system.
[2:58:57] This ladian age ends in black out of the
[2:59:00] word
[2:59:04] as musicians are coming now thereby
[2:59:07] causing a departure of the Lord from the
[2:59:09] mid.
[2:59:14] He stands outside
[2:59:17] calling to his own who follow him by
[2:59:20] obedience to the word.
[2:59:24] Are you hearing this, brother?
[2:59:28] After a short and powerful demonstration
[2:59:31] of the spirit,
[2:59:37] this little hunted and persecuted group
[2:59:44] will go to be with Jesus
[2:59:48] [Applause]
[2:59:50] on Wednesday.
[2:59:52] I'm going to take it higher.
[2:59:55] I will start with that phrase
[2:59:57] after a short powerful demonstration of
[3:00:00] the spirit.
[3:00:09] The little hunted and persecuted bride

[3:01:44] happening
[3:01:47] spiritually.

[3:01:53] off to go and be with Jesus.
