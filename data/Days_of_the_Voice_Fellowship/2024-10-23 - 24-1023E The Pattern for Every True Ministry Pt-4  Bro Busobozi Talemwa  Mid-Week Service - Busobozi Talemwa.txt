Jesus amen [Applause] uh I would like to greet each and every one of you tonight if you can turn to your neighbor and greet them as well bless amen amen am thank you musicians I think that's all the singing we will do for now uh if you can take your Bibles with me while you're still standing we usually have a short time on Wednesday evening so we go straight away to the word and I I see I think this is a friend of joah you're welcome my eyes could to see you nice to see you amen so uh this evening I would uh have also been asked to minister to the Saints at evening light bright Tabernacle so we will be speaking to them as well in the service and listening they're going to be listening to this on Zoom so we send our greetings and also greet each of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ um going to continue on the subject we've been talking on this is the third service or the fourth service rather the pattern for every true Ministry and we've been looking at different things so tonight we'll see how the Lord will lead us um we will read that verse again Romans 11:29 whenever I'm speaking to evening light I just do one hour so just give me your undivided attention for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance Romans 1129 can you interpret it according to the KJV for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance I do not know Whata means um how how does that understand how is it rendered because here I understand that God gives it and you do not need to repent for him to give it to you that's how I understand it how do you understand it in okay that is also true but um you know they do not add this other meaning because you see if yes if God has given you a gift he doesn't regret even Satan all the gifts he when he was still in heaven when he fell they were never taken from him so God doesn't regret but that's not the exact meaning it's saying when God gives I mean the basis he's talking about the the basis of God gifting you and calling you it is without repentance without repentance yes that's exactly what I'm trying to talk about we can also look at vers 24 um or did I say vers 24 I would like us to look at Matthew 24 vers 24 um we can begin from the 23 then if any man shall say unto you law here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect 23 24 23 2423 I'd like us also to look at the next verse behold I have told you before whereof if Thou shalt say wherefor if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret Chambers believe it not praise the name of the Lord hallelujah maybe um you may be seated now regarding first of all of course um this is just a continuation so I hope I will not say things that are new to some of you who are just hearing for the first time tonight now speaking of gifts you are born with gifts you do not have to first repent of your sins and be saved for God to give you gifts and because of that many people have been confused they thought that great gifted people are saved it means that they are automatically going to heaven but we found that actually there will be many who will even be uh gifted but they will not make it into the kingdom of God on Sunday we spoke about that extensively how many will cast out Devils how they will prophesy in the name of Jesus how they will do many wonderful works in the name of Jesus but when they get there Jesus will say unto them go away from me doers of iniquity I never knew you so then we find it is not because of these Works uh through our gifts that we will receive salvation and therefore we do not test a true Ministry only because the man is doing many miracles and wonders signs and wonders if it was so we would actually have you know also join some of those churches where demons are cast out and they called them Deliverance Ministries you know all where some of those churches where we only hear prophecies and um you know all some of those churches where wonderful Miracles are wrote but we understand all these things are part of the word miracles signs wonders and casting out of demons it's part of the word is part of the as we shall see later on tonight is part of the true Ministry but you see it is not the only basis upon which you say this is a true Ministry and so on Sunday I la to show you that extensively and um to those who were here and those who listened and I also I've added this scripture in Matthew 24 that says um that false Christ shall come now remember he never said false jesuses but he said for there shall arise false christs so now this the word Christ here means the anointed ones so he says false anointed ones will come why are they false yet they are anointed so in other words they are anointed with the right anointing but they are false teachers of that anointing how many understand that say Amen so you see they mislead people they misguide them simply because they are anointed you see and I we also read many other scriptures like the one that shows that Satan has made himself the angel of Light and his ministers also the Ministers of righteousness so there are many people who will preach but when God never sent them the devil is using them it is it is so ironical that you see they would take the Bible and preach it but when they are not Servants of God but Servants of Satan but we found out from Matthew 7 that the Bible says ye shall know them by their fruits and he said every tree that bringeth not good fruit is is is is H down and cast Into the Fire where by their fuit you shall know them not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he now listen to this but he that doeth the will of of of My Father which is in heaven so now in other words it is not only all those that profess confess Christ that that confess they are believers that say they believe what the Bible says it's not about all those it's only the select few that do the will of God and what is the will of God the will of God is the full councel of his he said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my my word shall never pass away so you see they they will they will they will put their faith upon the basis of the word not the basis of their man of God not on the basis of their Church manuals not on the basis of what their denomination believes they will be Spirit L they will believe the word 100% And so he also says many will say to me in that day Lord we have prophesied in your name have we not in your name we we've cast out devils in your name we have done many wonderful works and I'll profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so now this scripture in Matthew 7 can be aligned properly aligned with the one of Matthew 24 because the one of Matthew 24 is saying there shall arise false Christ of course in the end time and false prophets and they will show Great Signs and wonders now now remember the Bible did not tell us to fear the one true Prophet the Bible told us to fear the many false prophets but again in the same Bible he gives a prophecy in Mal over over a true Prophet who will come in the last days and he says this Prophet when he comes he will take the hearts of the children and restore it back to the father and we have received that prophet in this end time but he says we should fear the many false prophets and of course there's much I can talk about them but I want I want us to stick with the subject for tonight the pattern for every true Ministry second Peter 1:10 says wherefor there rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure you by God but you have to make it sure in Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 45 make full proof of your ministry so how can you know that God has truly called you so now I'm not tonight I'm not speaking really so much about the false prophets and that kind of I'm speaking about the true Ministry and each of us is called by God each of us is gifted in a a certain way so then how can you know that such and such a thing is what I'm supposed to do to serve the Lord how can you know you are supposed to be a singer you are supposed to be a preacher how can you know you are in the perfect will of God praise the name of the Lord when someone receives the Holy Spirit they should be blessed in their perfect place to serve the Lord the Holy Spirit activates you and you become an active member of the body one way of knowing you don't have the Holy Spirit is being dant in the body you know if you want to know that one part of your body is not working it will be dant it's like you know if like I'm I'm a full body from head to toy but you see if my hand for instance does not move remains in one place and the other body moves but that hand remains in one place it means it is a dead part of the body it means it is nonfunctional and there it is useless so now you find many people in the body not this body I'm talking about the body of Jesus Christ whereby they are nonfunctional they are static they in the same place they never do anything to I believe when you receive the Holy Spirit he's going to activate you he's going to make you realize what you should do for the sake of the Gospel is going to make you understand what part are you in the body the Bible says there are many parts about vessels and he says some are vessels of horor and he says some are vessels of Dishonor but all vessels in the house and in this case we speaking about the house of the Lord what type of vessel are you whereby you realize you in the church one year two years three years four years there is nothing you can and you call yourself a Christian you can't play mus you can't sing a special you can't preach you can't testify to your neighbor you can't interpret you are seeing that sometimes we need interpreters you just SE I'm a Believer a Believer who does nothing is useless to the body you can't give your money you can't pray for the preachers I mean there many things to do the Holy Spirit Will activate you you can't become Idol you canot remain Idol he will BL it on your heart and he will confirm it and you will become an active member of the body of Jesus Christ now we will not all do the same things you know in in in Romans 124 he says for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of One of another have you got it if you've got it say Amen so we are one body in Christ but we are not one members we are many members the body of Jesus Christ is a many membered body and it's all over the world having then gifts having then gifts no we are members and then he says having then gifts deferring according to the grace that is given to us where the prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith Ministry us on our ministry and I told you there many many types of Minister it's not only preaching there's many other types of ministry even the brother or sister who cleans the church ministering to the body you know we cannot do without them imagine if you came to a church and you found it very dirty and smelly and Dusty and you cannot concentrate you want to hear the word but you can't but you see because there's a you don't even know who clean the quite frankly many times they come to church without even knowing who cleaned the church and they never paid but whoever does it is a part of the body and there is a reward for every work you do for the Lord you know you know you maybe sing a song or maybe pray where no one even sees you and you pray for the ministry or maybe you know you you play music musical instruments or maybe you interpre or or maybe you know you say Amen in the church do you even know that to say Amen in the church is ministering you're ministering to someone else you know or when someone is dozing and he you say Amen oh yeah I should also say Amen next time and then they will be attentive to hear then will say Amen but if you sit next to someone who is dozing you realize you're also dozing like them because they are ministering to you praise the name of the Lord we don't want to minister to each other like that we want to influence each other the right way amen amen even shouting and Clapping Your Hands singing you know enjoying the word you know it's ministering going out passing a tra Minister you see say all Ministry let us wait on our ministry by the way this is the best job that you can ever do Jesus Christ hired all his followers all the followers of Jesus are hired and they hired by Jesus and they are paid by Jesus hallelujah amen and I am hired by him and let me tell you you can never serve him and he doesn't reward you you may be the one moving the cameras and do the sound or whatever it is let me tell you you are hired by him and the way he pays you is not the way man pays you man May pay you one million but one million cannot give you oxygen for one year but you see someone who is earning 1 million and not serving the lord may be sick each time and when they have to go and check how much they spend on the hospital bills it's quite a lot but you you are healthy you you are hired by Jesus we should learn to appreciate Jesus Christ as long as we are serving him he pays us he promised to pay us and he promised to give us 100 here and 100 over there so in other words whatever we enjoying here on Earth is just the beginning of our payments there is much more coming in heaven we shall be paid in heaven we shall be rewarded with much more much more than what manone can give much more than what man can give that's why brother sister even come to churches serving God yes it is oh he that teaches let him wait on teaching he that exal on exaltation he that he that give let him do it with Simplicity did you know even giving is a gift praise the name of the Lord give with Simplicity don't complicate things don't first go on cam to give give with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that show Mercy with cheerfulness and so we see there's many kinds of Ministries but tonight I want to look at um and I hope tonight I I'll put this to a close the three-fold quality of a true Ministry how do you know that your ministry or someone's Ministry is of God how do you know if you in a true church ministry or you're following the right teaching how do you know how do you um weigh the kind of ministry you are under or the kind of ministry that you have so this goes from the of the ministry as a church to the ministry that you have as an individual and then to whether you are following the right Ministry and so I'm I'm going to answer this um by reading from the church ede book and a very very interesting fact here in the Ephesian Church age Paul founded the church at Ephesus about the middle of the first century this enables us to set the date of the beginning of the Ephesian Church [Music] 3 Paul's manner of ministering set the pattern that all future Messengers were to Aspire to and actually sets the pattern for every true minister of God you see we have a generation age some of you who know we are living in the seventh age and um you know there have been other six ages before us how can we know the kind of ministry that God used in every one of these Generations how can we know that it is um Paul that he used in well the Bible tells us is Paul because he said he was the Apostle to the Gentiles and so from this we understand and brother bam says here Paul set the pattern his kind of ministry the kind of ministry he had it set the pattern for every other messenger that came now we can say the second Church age we will know what kind of messenger it will the Third Church age pegamos will know what kind of messenger they will have the fourth Church age theth all of them up to the last one we can be able to not surely God used that man in that generation to some of you who don't know there are seven gentle ages and in each age God uses one man you had me WR one man one man called a messenger and it is his revelation of the word that all others of that age will Feist from if you doubt what I just said you can check in the Book of Revelation chapter one chapter 2 chapter 3 there are seven distinct Church agents we know there is one Church of Jesus Christ but you see there were the Jews but when the Jews were C according to Romans 11 they were C when were they cut off Romans chapter I mean Acts chapter 8 that's where we see they began blasing and refusing what the disciples were saying and from that day the disciples looked at them and they said because you are rejecting the world from today we turn to the Gentiles so from that time the message has come to the Gentiles and the Gentiles are the rest of the world apart from Israel but you see the Gentiles have what we call a dispensation a period of time after which God will now leave them and go back to the Jews but you see that the the the the dispensation is a dispensation of seven gentle Church ages and the Bible is very clear in the Book of Revelation he calls them candlesticks and you see he said the candlesticks because when when John was in a vision he saw and voice told him the candlesticks you are seeing are seven churches but we understand Jesus has one church so there this is not just seven churches but it means seven generations of the same church and from ephes Philadelphia up toia we are living in the last one but Paul did I mean John did not only seek candlesticks he also saw stars seven stars and and the voice told him you know those Seven Stars you know are angels to the seven churches what does the word angel mean means messenger an angel is a messenger a a prophet a messenger so now these seven churches had seven Messengers praise the name of the Lord and that's how we are able to know that the Gentiles have a period of seven churches and seven Messengers and how are we able to those seven Messengers we can only find a pattern that the first one operated in and then we can be able to say ahuh the rest of them are all going to follow the same patter they're going to follow the same manner of ministry then we can be able to say that is the is the message that is the messenger that is the messenger praise the name of the Lord there are three things or three qualities that we can be able to look up and say these are the qualities that every Messenger will have because it's what Paul had in the beginning now not for only the generations also the preachers the individual ministers how can you know someone is a true minister they must flow in the same pattern how can you know a church ministry is the right one it should flow in the same pattern praise the name of the Lord and so the first one Paul was absolutely true to the word he never deviated from it no matter what the costul stayed with the word and by the way the word was not did not come from Paul the word came from Jesus Christ that even Paul himself could not change he could not alter a letter of that word did you know Paul preached that women should not be pastors Paul preached one God Paul preached husband should love their wives Paul preached women should submit themselves to their husbands Paul preached if tongues are spoken in church it should be interpreted PA preached baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in much water Paul preached amen baptism of the Holy Ghost that everyone who believes must be filled with the Holy Ghost Paul preached the serpent SE and someone came to me last time I said why is that in the Bible because if our messenger today Willam Bram is our Time s messenger if he is the one how can we know we can know according to the first pattern he should walk and operate in the pattern of Paul should teach what PA if he deviates from it then we run away we know he's not the one so William Bram never brought any new idea come on church he never started a new no he took us back again to what Paul told Hallelujah and every true Messenger should take us back again and every preure today no matter how many people he has if he doesn't take us back to the foundations then we know it's not true to the world what Paul tau is the word it cannot be altered it cannot be changed it cannot be reduced it cannot be added on no matter how much we try the word of God Will Remain the word of God because the Bible says the word of God is forever set in heaven when God gives his word his first thought was perfect he can't change it and so all the messengers of God when they come they'll preach nothing new they'll preach the same thing that God had said in the beginning praise the name of the Lord in Galatians 1:8 Paul spoke to the Gan and he told them these words but though we are an angel from heaven even if it is us we the disciples or an angel comes flying and he comes from Heaven if he preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a cast now Paul had the audacity to say these words because he knew what he said was not his ideas what he said was God speaking it cannot be altered not by Paul not by a preacher not by even an angel so now we can be able to see the false ch ches if they come and tell us we should pray through a woman Mar or whatever it is then we will search it in the teachings of Paul we won't find it there then we shall tell them you are Liars when they tell us that pastor's wife should also be a pastor she should also be a Bible teacher we shall go in the teachings of Paul where is it if you don't find it there no matter how many people following that church no matter how many manifestations that Ministry has we shall not follow it because we will not their allar no matter how good they speak but if their Ministry that doesn't believe in the baptism of the Holy then we not the allar because we're going to see here things that were in the ministry of Paul they believed the word they believe the word church Hallelujah he said let anybody be a curse if he comes and preaches another gospel all right I'm so glad that we are preaching the same old gospel Paul the same Gospel of Jesus Christ and so and here well I would want to read a lot but uh let me just continue here because of time I had other scriptures to give you to confirm that but that's all right he says notice that Paul was unorganized but Spirit [Music] Le someone Paul was unorganized Spirit l don't fear your neighbor tell them was SP Hallelujah spirit and every true minister is Spirit every messenger who are Spirit Le we don't believe in being led by an organization we believe in being led by the Holy Ghost Pastor should be led by the Holy Ghost there is no system that leads us but there is only one thing that leads us the old time hallelujah hallelujah amen Jerusalem Jerusalem's councel never sent Paul out nor did it have any power all jurisdiction over him imagine tomorrow someone coming saying that they are firing me let me tell you Church a true God called preacher cannot be hired and cannot be fired did you hear what I just said we are not hirings we are hired by God we are called by God and by this message we have made our calling and election sure and therefore we cannot be fired by man we cannot be fired by organization hallelujah amen that's why it should come down from the age to the churches to the pastors then even to the gifts and the callings in the body I play the piano because I'm called by God you should be able to say I wasn't hired I can't be fired I sing because I was called by God I wasn't hired I can't be fire I clean the church because I was called by God I wasn't hired I can't be fired every one of us should be able to say the same same thing praise God God Alone did the sending and the leading Paul was not of men but of God that's why we are not a denomination denominations send you and brother said if the denomination sent you let it take care of you but if God sent you let him take care of you hallelujah amen when I went to Ethiopia with my young wife we were just newly married we were basically really literally children but God sent us there there was there came a time when we did not know how we shall make ends meat but God was moving things were happening people were getting saved and we didn't know how and where we shall get money from but then one Edis had the testimony of what God is doing and he wrote me an email one time he said brother I want you to understand we are going to be behind you 100% And we are going to support that a man from Canada never met me before how could he be behind what we were doing he didn't send me there I want to show you when God sends you he will give you Partners when God sends you he will give you supporters when God sends you he will give you connections and that's the God we serve he the same yesterday and forever you don't need a man to sanction you and send you no we are Spirit La hallelujah amen Paul was not of men but of God hallelujah and here Paul writes in Galatians 1:1 Paul an apostle today if someone says I am an apost still and Paul call himself an apostle Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead praise the name of the Lord and in Galatians 235 says but neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false Brethren una AWS brought [Music] in who came in prively to spy they came in privately to spy out our Liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom he gave place by subjection to whom we gave place by subjection no not for for an hour some people came in and they came in privately spying on our Liberty we have in Christ by the way do you know the Liberty we have as Believers of this message they ask us what umbrella are you under we tell them our umbrella is the umbrella of Jesus Christ they tell you ask who is your Archbishop tell Bishop is Jesus Christ what is your denomination we have believer you have so much Liberty come under our umbrella Paul said they want this man wanted to put him in under bondage to whom they gave no they said they gave no they give place they says to whom they never give place to subject themselves under them no not for an hour we as Believers of this message cannot even under these umbrellas you are hearing world of churches we cannot we we cannot submit not for an hour not for half an hour not for a minute because we have Liberty we are set free from denominationalism how do you operate I say we operate by the power of the Holy Spirit how are you able to be controlled how do you control your Min the word and the holy ghost that is how the first church was that's how the church today should be amen what is your religion we are just Christians praise the name of the Lord how many are you in the world we don't know also but all we know there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all on fire they are all baptized in Jesus name filled with the Holy Ghost who are you we are following of Jesus Christ we are almost in every corner let me tell you Believers of this message are in every corner all over the world all over the world all over the world they believe this message and it's not only in our generation it has been even the generations before us that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you with denomination the truth of the Gospel cannot continue because you have to understand denomination separates Brotherhood denomination removes Fellowship that's why here always we say we have no law but love no book but the Bible no Creed but Christ no membership but fellowship and the blood of Jesus worship and cleanses us from all sin secondly his ministry was in the power of the spirit that's another type the first way we see a true Ministry it will not be a denomination it will not operate like denomination it will be word best as long as the Bible says it that and I'm so glad that we are one of those our ministry is word best hallelujah hallelujah it's not about the man William Bram the man PA the word and the man Jesus Christ and secondly his ministry was in the power of the spirit oh hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written work hallelujah amen you see how you able to understand a true Ministry it's not only because they are preaching the word correctly there should also be the demonstration of the power of demonstration of the word the demonstration of the spoken and written word yes there should be the power of the spirit his ministry was in the power of the spirit in First Corinthians 2 he said and I Brethren when I came to you I did not come with Excellence of speech of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determin not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not inspirational preaching was not just inspirational preaching other just it was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in a demonstration of the spirit and power hallelujah amen that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God and I say wherever I have preached this message I have seen demonstration of the spirit and power Hallelujah when God sent William Bram did not just come with teachings and doctrines there was demonstration there was power there was the spirit coming behind those words talk about a prophet they would stand and say if what I have preached is the truth let the god of the Bible the god I've been talking about let him come forth Hallelujah and everything goes quiet everything goes and then he begins to call out names of people sick people he calls them by name and he says who did you touch you never touched me but you touched him he he he says what was that that was not me I don't know you have never seen you that was God the god of the Bible lifting him out of History the Supernatural and this message is one the problem many Believers are becoming intellectuals where they no longer believe in the Supernatural power but brother this word is power it is power hallelujah amen I've seen sick men healed I have seen people vomit witchcraft just by the preaching of this message I have seen the sick healed come on what are we talking about we talking about the power of the word if only we can come and open our heart I've seen Sinners get saved I've seen fornicators being sh being filled with the Holy Ghost I've seen Sinners becoming Preachers by the power of this message because Jesus is power is not only words words words words I don't even need to preach and pray over you let me tell you you need to understand the difference between this message and the Pentecostal denominations is that they do it but here Jesus does it to confirm [Applause] theallu churches we don't look for man of God man of God man of God churches are not about man of God our churches are about God of the world Amen Hallelujah sir where you preach the Bible says I sent my word and my word healed them my word delivered if you come to church with an open mind let me tell you Church it doesn't matter which situation you are in you may be loed down in ha if you open your heart by the hearing of these words it sets you free it sends Demons back in it delivers you that's what the power of the word can do and Paul heard that the dead were raised Paul one time was preaching and and and a man called he was doing but he was in the presence and he fell down and died but talk about the power of the world when he died Paul went there he on the young man and he told him come on get up he told them the younger boy is not dead he is sleeping and do you know why he died because he was dozing do you know why he was doing because Paul was preaching for so long no wonder we preach for long in our Mage church because the true message is being followed by that thing we don't sing for 4 hours and preach for 30 minutes it is the word that transformed and the younger man was lifted up and he lived hallelujah amen the healing of the sick and the healing of the Lamb do he believe the message does these things that's the power of this message that's the power of the message it must accomplish those things that's the second way of knowing a true Ministry not word word words no there must be the power of the Holy Ghost to F follow that word where the sick are healed where the Sinners are saved where the people filled the where signs and wonders are happening Hallelujah truly the signs of an apostle were wrote among you in all patience in signs in wonders and mighty Deeds 2 Corinthians 1212 that's what we believe and every two minist must be followed by you may be a singer how do we know you call and you have a true Ministry that is not going to be only knowing how to sing you are singing is going to be backed up by the hoolu when you sing the of the Holy Spirit go through the people and everybody's move what is it it is a gift that is true you find that a sister was playing the piano and they were singing The Great physician now here and the sister was not playing because she knows how to play she was playing in the Holy Ghost and she was swept away and the Holy Spirit came and took over and the sister started and the Holy Spirit this happened in one of the meetings of brother musicians play in the spirit we are not coming here to hear people that have trained themselves we coming to be laid by the spirit amen even if it is a singing I hate to hear an overtrained voice where are you sing until you become blue in your eyes no we want to hear something that will lead us into the supernatural hallelujah amen amen and my time is up but next time I'll talk about the third one the fruit of your god-given ministry what comes out of it by that we will know that was of God but where you Minister and people that was not of God your ministry should deliver someone can say because of that because of that sister because of that my life is never same God bless you hallelujah hallelujah let us pray our precious Heavenly Father we want to thank you so much this evening for your word which you have
