[1:05:24] generation with power almost amen
[1:05:32] many people have entrepanji
[1:05:35] have preached on power

[1:05:42] there's the power of the Cross
[1:05:44] there's the power of the blood
[1:05:47] there's the power over sin
[1:05:50] there's the power of the spoken word
[1:05:53] there's the power of Grace
[1:05:56] the word of his power is
[1:05:59] power to pursue
[1:06:05] you know these are all titles
[1:06:12] you know what humans are actually
[1:06:13] consumed with the desire for power
[1:06:19] yes yes
[1:06:23] somehow there's a desire to to be
[1:06:26] powerful
[1:06:29] some desire strength
[1:06:34] there was a gentleman in 2014
[1:06:39] um
[1:06:40] he said a new world record
[1:06:45] with a 500 pound log yes
[1:07:06] I wouldn't think so this gentleman also
[1:07:10] he did a raw squat who's there who knows
[1:07:12] what a squat is
[1:07:15] a squat like gym class you know you go
[1:07:17] down and you do squats
[1:07:25] you put the weights on your shoulders
[1:07:30] we call that a squad
[1:07:34] I don't know what you call it that's the
[1:07:36] name of it
[1:07:38] but this fella in 2014 he did an 880
[1:07:42] pound squat
[1:07:45] um
[1:07:52] 880 pounds on his shoulders
[1:07:59] serious power in them
[1:08:03] yeah he did a 900 pound deadlift Nazi
[1:08:08] Tula pound
[1:08:09] so that's if you do
[1:08:14] and he did a 629 pound bench press that
[1:08:26] power
[1:08:29] you didn't think you were coming to
[1:08:31] Fitness class did you
[1:08:40] man has mental power
[1:08:43] there's men that there's men and women
[1:08:45] that have Minds that are just incredible
[1:08:51] and they desire more
[1:08:54] search for man wisdom
[1:08:58] it's like an insatiable thirst
[1:09:03] man desire man has built machines
[1:09:08] to lift spaceships spaceships into space
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:14] these are all just different forms of a
[1:09:16] power you know
[1:09:18] there's electrical power
[1:09:23] there was some lightning I think or some
[1:09:25] Thunder yesterday
[1:09:28] in the clouds there's there's lightning
[1:09:30] bolts
[1:09:33] no one lightning bolt
[1:09:37] when it zaps the ground
[1:09:41] it has enough power in a bolt of
[1:09:44] lightning just one
[1:09:46] and it comes out like that because just
[1:09:50] that fast you're blinking it's gone
[1:09:53] but in that one bolt of lightning
[1:09:57] it could light up because
[1:10:04] 56 homes
[1:10:07] for about one day
[1:10:17] thank you
[1:10:19] there's the natural disasters anybody
[1:10:21] ever seen a hurricane or a tornado dance
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:33] yes Amina
[1:10:36] and man who seeks to be powerful
[1:10:41] presidents around the world that
[1:10:44] feel they have the most power
[1:10:48] and yet there's a desire for more
[1:10:57] but I want to speak today on a different
[1:10:58] Power
[1:11:02] Man can have their intellectual Powers
[1:11:08] they can have their machine
[1:11:12] or to speak about a different Power
[1:11:14] today
[1:11:19] you know when a disaster strikes oh
[1:11:25] you wonder how are you gonna how would
[1:11:27] you respond yeah
[1:11:30] I don't know if you've ever had a major
[1:11:32] disaster or you know do they have
[1:11:34] earthquakes or anything here yeah
[1:11:36] earthquakes
[1:11:44] so if you're in a community and there is
[1:11:47] a massive landslide that came down wait
[1:11:49] a minute
[1:11:51] and the power of all that Earth now that
[1:11:54] is moving to consume a community
[1:11:59] and now things start to get in in a bit
[1:12:01] of a panic moment
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:05] everything that you were doing has just
[1:12:08] ceased
[1:12:10] and something now some people
[1:12:15] respond differently in these situations
[1:12:20] some people freeze
[1:12:27] but some people
[1:12:29] they switch gears
[1:12:34] something inside of them
[1:12:36] that they didn't even really even know
[1:12:38] was there
[1:12:40] kicks in the gear
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:44] right and so they become suddenly this
[1:12:46] this they become calm
[1:12:49] they start directing what needs to
[1:12:51] happen
[1:12:53] they're running to maybe save a loved
[1:12:55] one that needs
[1:12:59] some Inner Strength
[1:13:02] that they didn't even know was there
[1:13:05] came to the surface
[1:13:08] you understand
[1:13:12] so there's a power that goes beyond
[1:13:15] physical
[1:13:19] it's somewhere inside
[1:13:22] that in a moment of disaster what you
[1:13:25] said is
[1:13:29] all right amen you know some people are
[1:13:32] like ah you know if I was in an
[1:13:33] earthquake
[1:13:36] I would be calm as a cucumber
[1:13:41] does that make is that a saying here
[1:13:46] and it just means
[1:14:10] that's usually how it is
[1:14:19] It's usually the person that you'd never
[1:14:21] think
[1:14:24] you never think they have something in
[1:14:27] them
[1:14:28] some inner strength
[1:14:31] and see everybody in the world you know
[1:14:33] they're all into yoga
[1:14:37] yoga right you know what yoga is yoga
[1:14:57] there's a different Inner Strength that
[1:14:59] comes from above
[1:15:03] not from sitting cross-legged with my
[1:15:05] fingers in a circle thinking about I
[1:15:07] don't know what you're too loud
[1:15:12] but there's a real Inner Strength
[1:15:16] that comes in a different time uh
[1:15:20] amen amen we're gonna go into that
[1:15:22] little bit
[1:15:24] so a common response
[1:15:28] a common response
[1:15:33] in a time of crisis
[1:15:37] these are the top five common responses
[1:15:45] some people
[1:15:47] a crisis comes
[1:15:50] a disaster strikes
[1:15:54] and they actually they they will start
[1:15:57] to laugh
[1:16:00] because they don't know how to process
[1:16:02] what's happening
[1:16:06] I don't know what to do
[1:16:08] and instead of having something cut rise
[1:16:11] up
[1:16:13] they Resort into either laughter
[1:16:17] or just silence
[1:16:20] this is this is this is actually science
[1:16:23] telling you this right now
[1:16:26] you know this is what they have studied
[1:16:28] this is what they say are the five
[1:16:30] common responses
[1:16:40] some people procrastinate
[1:16:45] disaster strikes
[1:16:48] and you get in a life or death situation
[1:16:52] and people then they want to prepare
[1:16:55] somehow
[1:16:58] when the World Trade Center was hit by a
[1:17:01] plane a wild Trade Center in Union
[1:17:03] America
[1:17:04] here here we are in a major moment of
[1:17:07] Crisis
[1:17:11] and they said 40 of the people in the
[1:17:14] tower
[1:17:18] went and gathered their personal
[1:17:20] belongings
[1:17:23] before they left the tower
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:28] you're like the building is about to go
[1:17:31] down and you're worrying about them
[1:17:37] that's crazy
[1:17:40] but it's a moment of crisis
[1:17:44] spiritually
[1:17:46] moment of Crisis
[1:17:48] Satan coming in like a flood
[1:17:52] oh I'll I'll maybe maybe next service
[1:17:58] maybe tomorrow
[1:18:04] I'll just get it later
[1:18:07] my social life's much more important
[1:18:13] you're in a tower
[1:18:15] which is zimby and it's coming down
[1:18:18] don't be running off for your personal
[1:18:21] belongings
[1:18:26] some people they have arrogance
[1:18:30] you know when an hurricane came in it
[1:18:32] comes into Florida so often Florida
[1:18:37] and so many people like nah my host is
[1:18:40] fine
[1:18:43] I'll put up some boards on the windows
[1:18:47] it's all good
[1:18:50] there's arrogance there
[1:18:53] just another storm
[1:18:57] and then what happens
[1:19:01] is in a few hours their house is not
[1:19:03] there anymore
[1:19:08] that's right they said in Hurricane
[1:19:11] Floyd in 1999
[1:19:18] 70 of the people drowned
[1:19:23] most of them in their cars
[1:19:27] in the flooded streets
[1:19:30] because despite the warning
[1:19:34] of saying hey don't drive in that water
[1:19:37] don't go out there
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:40] that's okay I got this
[1:19:44] it's an arrogance
[1:19:50] say don't go out in the world don't go
[1:19:53] out in the world
[1:19:54] don't go in the world don't go out don't
[1:19:57] fool them don't play with Satan's Kings
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:01] don't go out and do that habit tell them
[1:20:03] that no problem don't socialize with
[1:20:05] those friends
[1:20:16] right Amina
[1:20:19] some people in a crisis moment
[1:20:22] they get tunnel vision but for not
[1:20:25] indoors
[1:20:28] and they get so focused on just one
[1:20:30] thing
[1:20:31] is
[1:20:33] some people in in many times in a flood
[1:20:39] they get so focused on their on their
[1:20:42] cats
[1:20:46] everything's flooding
[1:20:48] hurricanes coming from
[1:20:51] and they're barely barely surviving
[1:20:55] but my cat is inside
[1:20:58] like you're gonna die
[1:21:02] but they get Tunnel Vision
[1:21:05] on one little thing right
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:32] forget about the habit
[1:21:36] some people in a crisis
[1:21:40] they just go into paralyze they get
[1:21:43] paralyzed
[1:21:50] happens often you go into a state of War
[1:21:55] okay
[1:21:57] and it's just there's just so much going
[1:21:59] on right it's just a catastrophe all
[1:22:01] around
[1:22:05] and some people they just freeze
[1:22:10] that's where if you look into studies
[1:22:14] they study about what's called a
[1:22:16] thousand yard
[1:22:19] stairs
[1:22:24] it's where soldiers are standing there
[1:22:26] and he's just looking
[1:22:31] and every chaos is all around him
[1:22:35] but he's in such a State of Shock
[1:22:44] foreign
[1:22:51] that's how it is sometimes in spiritual
[1:22:53] Crisis
[1:22:57] get in such a state of spiritual trauma
[1:23:00] is
[1:23:09] up some people just are in shock
[1:23:14] and they're just paralyzed for
[1:23:21] these are common reactions
[1:23:26] in a crisis
[1:23:29] but there are some
[1:23:32] there are a few
[1:23:34] that react totally different
[1:23:39] we would call them a heroic
[1:23:42] active
[1:23:44] some power inside of them
[1:23:47] they don't laugh they don't
[1:23:50] procrastinate
[1:23:51] they don't have an arrogance you don't
[1:23:55] got tunnel vision
[1:23:57] they're not in shock
[1:23:59] but they move in action
[1:24:03] something moves
[1:24:05] up an inner substance
[1:24:10] bombs are dropping
[1:24:13] balloons are coming down
[1:24:15] um
[1:24:18] they get in action
[1:24:26] that's when a nuclear reactor in Russia
[1:24:29] blew up
[1:24:33] major disaster
[1:24:37] late 80s
[1:24:40] brother Michael that's like long before
[1:24:42] I was born it was so long ago it's
[1:24:44] history
[1:24:47] I was like born in 2000s
[1:24:51] it still applies
[1:24:54] Chernobyl they had to send divers into
[1:24:59] the radioactive water
[1:25:11] nobody wanted to go into into the into
[1:25:14] the
[1:25:15] plants
[1:25:18] they had to go and release a valve
[1:25:26] they stood there in a room and they said
[1:25:29] to the workers that were in there
[1:25:32] he said we need three people
[1:25:35] to go back into the plant okay
[1:25:42] in the dark
[1:25:44] and find this valve
[1:25:49] and most people
[1:25:52] foreign
[1:26:25] amen Amina everybody know about the
[1:26:27] Titanic
[1:26:30] you don't want the Titanic of course it
[1:26:32] went down and thousands of people died
[1:26:37] but you know who is thought to be the
[1:26:40] last person that went into the water
[1:26:42] is
[1:26:45] It's usually the the captain of the boat
[1:26:49] captain
[1:26:54] but one of the chefsumbi
[1:26:58] you say well who is that exactly
[1:27:01] probably a nobody on them
[1:27:05] but he was tossing people into boats
[1:27:11] chairs overboard
[1:27:16] and finally as the boat went down he was
[1:27:19] the last one to hang on the rail and go
[1:27:21] down with the boat
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:26] most people are running back and forth
[1:27:29] trying to find a spot on a Lifeboat
[1:27:35] he's looking overboard
[1:27:39] toss and chairs
[1:27:41] because there are swimmers down there
[1:27:45] I needed something to float with
[1:27:47] chocolate how are you that calm
[1:27:52] when the boat is going down
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:03] all right
[1:28:07] one more example for you
[1:28:11] there was a man called Louis Zamperini
[1:28:15] um Italian
[1:28:25] he's Italian
[1:28:27] Italy
[1:28:45] whiskey from Moonshiners
[1:28:54] but his brother forced him to start
[1:28:56] running
[1:29:02] so he started to run he actually went to
[1:29:04] the Olympics
[1:29:06] Olympics he then joined the military
[1:29:11] and in the war and I'm going to tell him
[1:29:13] his plane gosh it crashed
[1:29:18] and he's in a Lifeboat in the water with
[1:29:21] two other comrades
[1:29:25] so here he's on the water for over 30
[1:29:28] days
[1:29:31] they have to bury one of his buddies in
[1:29:34] the water
[1:29:38] 47 Days Later
[1:29:41] 47 days on the ocean
[1:29:45] he's rescued foreign
[1:29:59] countless Horrors
[1:30:04] he then went to another
[1:30:06] camping and Time After Time After Time
[1:30:13] he was beaten
[1:30:16] somehow the the the leader of the
[1:30:19] Campbell
[1:30:21] just focused on him all the time
[1:30:25] in fact at one point
[1:30:29] the commander of the camp Oh no um
[1:30:34] had him punched in the face
[1:30:36] 220 times
[1:30:46] that is just one out of Untold amount of
[1:30:49] things he had to go through
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:55] but he did something in him
[1:30:59] would not let him give up
[1:31:05] it's almost Indescribable
[1:31:09] the one time the the captain or the the
[1:31:12] commander yeah
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:18] foreign
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:52] he said I don't even how you go through
[1:31:54] those things
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:32:01] but it's because there's a power inside
[1:32:05] compelling him
[1:32:08] I'm gonna live
[1:32:12] I'm gonna live
[1:32:13] there's something about life
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:17] there's a drive of life
[1:32:21] just doesn't want to give up
[1:32:27] so now
[1:32:29] spiritually
[1:32:30] when a disaster comes like a flood
[1:32:34] the enemy is coming
[1:32:36] there is one who raises a standard
[1:32:41] amen I want you to spark all those
[1:32:43] examples
[1:32:46] in your mind
[1:32:48] in the back of your mind
[1:32:51] that's a natural aspect
[1:32:55] there's a natural power inside
[1:33:00] spiritually
[1:33:02] there's a flood upon us
[1:33:06] but then there's got to be a power man
[1:33:09] there's got to be a standard
[1:33:11] must rise up
[1:33:13] push back again
[1:33:17] the anime movie
[1:33:21] so let's step back in time just a little
[1:33:23] bit
[1:33:25] and here Bueno Satan's kingdom
[1:33:29] suffered a devastating blow wow
[1:33:35] that day on Calvary Calvary amen amen
[1:33:40] and Satan was reeling it is
[1:33:43] from the impact
[1:33:46] of what had just happened
[1:33:49] what just took place in Calvary Church
[1:33:53] Satan going back to his control
[1:33:57] he's going back to his planning room
[1:34:01] seeing how do I deal with this
[1:34:04] what just happened there on the cross
[1:34:07] all of my plans
[1:34:18] amen Amina hey man we'll go into it
[1:34:21] maybe in another service of what
[1:34:22] happened at that moment but Satan had to
[1:34:24] go back said Tanya
[1:34:26] he had to devise a new plan
[1:34:30] I need to figure out a way
[1:34:33] I just can't let this one rise up and
[1:34:36] demolish my kingdom this way
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:41] and so Satan got started going to work
[1:34:44] he says how do I do this
[1:34:49] his mind goes back to the beginning
[1:34:54] he says
[1:34:56] I just must pervert the word again
[1:35:02] I need to infiltrate the word
[1:35:06] ready to corrupt the word
[1:35:10] if it worked one Eve
[1:35:13] if I could just pervert in a little bit
[1:35:17] you won't die if
[1:35:20] that is what worked there
[1:35:25] you know why why change it up I'm just
[1:35:27] gonna go back to my original plan yeah
[1:35:33] and so now Satan starts it's a tiny not
[1:35:35] time to come his plan
[1:35:39] yeah brother Brian says now because when
[1:35:43] we see God's seed begin to take hold
[1:35:47] on
[1:35:49] he says then that fellow coming in is
[1:35:51] just as slick as he can be
[1:35:56] Who quote scripture
[1:35:59] watch him he's a deceiver
[1:36:02] he's a deformer
[1:36:04] A perverter
[1:36:06] or a corrupter of the Original Seed
[1:36:13] that's what he is attorney Charlie you
[1:36:16] know times have changed a little bit
[1:36:19] we gotta adapt with the time
[1:36:23] just the message a little bit
[1:36:27] we need to make it a little easier it's
[1:36:30] too strict you know
[1:36:35] so just a little bit
[1:36:41] it's okay to act like the world
[1:36:44] and go to church
[1:36:46] it's okay to do that
[1:36:49] I can live one way
[1:36:52] no I'll come to church
[1:36:58] but I can live corrupt on the other side
[1:37:03] not the message I serve oh yeah
[1:37:08] but Satan's a perverter
[1:37:12] Amen brother Brahm says now watch for
[1:37:15] that corrupter
[1:37:16] [Applause]
[1:37:18] he'll be Sly
[1:37:21] he'll be slick
[1:37:25] but keep your vision
[1:37:29] keep your vision
[1:37:35] when someone says well you know I don't
[1:37:37] know if brother Branham really said that
[1:37:39] or do you really need to follow that you
[1:37:41] say I'm keeping my eyes on the prize
[1:37:50] I tell you you just don't accept someone
[1:37:53] says well you know what the prophet said
[1:37:54] this
[1:37:55] is
[1:37:59] you know I don't know you go and look up
[1:38:02] in the message
[1:38:05] you go search it out
[1:38:08] don't you just swallow also well yeah
[1:38:10] brother Branham said brother Branham
[1:38:12] said through your filter her I'm gonna
[1:38:13] go read it myself
[1:38:22] that's why there's a passion to get the
[1:38:24] message into your language
[1:38:29] around the world
[1:38:32] because you got to be able to dig into
[1:38:34] this message
[1:38:36] you have to dig into this message
[1:38:40] for yourself
[1:38:43] not riding on someone else's Revelation
[1:38:46] what God reveals to you
[1:38:49] how can you reveal it to you if you
[1:38:52] don't dig into it
[1:38:58] you ever play we call the game a
[1:39:00] telephone
[1:39:05] and if I whisper the word to this
[1:39:07] brother here and he's here
[1:39:11] it tells it to this
[1:39:13] and he tells it
[1:39:15] and then he whispers and you just keep
[1:39:17] Whispering it along
[1:39:23] I guarantee you it isn't the word that I
[1:39:28] told this brother
[1:39:30] it's gotten it's gotten perverted a
[1:39:33] little bit
[1:39:35] corrupted as it went through everybody
[1:39:41] that's why you must be able to read the
[1:39:43] word yourself
[1:39:46] go through a whole bunch of people
[1:39:48] you need to be able to read it
[1:39:52] revealed to you
[1:39:55] that's why we showed her the burden to
[1:39:58] run with this message
[1:40:20] don't let Satan play a game and
[1:40:22] telephone with you okay
[1:40:32] and so Satan Satan
[1:40:36] started to release a power yeah
[1:40:40] Through the Ages now
[1:40:43] his desire to corrupt The Original Seed
[1:40:46] of God
[1:40:51] he said I want you to dig in a little
[1:40:53] bit young people no
[1:40:57] if we're reading the scripture
[1:40:59] we read about the powers that were
[1:41:02] released in Revelation
[1:41:06] and we know the horse riders that were
[1:41:09] sent out
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:11] we know Revelation
[1:41:14] and then there's the four living
[1:41:16] creatures that surround the throne
[1:41:19] we know the lion the ox the man
[1:41:27] amen Amina all right
[1:41:31] if it wasn't for this message
[1:41:34] we would be of men most miserable
[1:41:38] everybody has their idea of what that
[1:41:41] scripture means
[1:41:44] that has a commentary on one way
[1:41:48] one preacher has his idea of what they
[1:41:51] are in another
[1:41:52] type of way but if it wasn't for a
[1:41:54] prophet
[1:41:57] we would be lost
[1:42:00] we'd be wondering ourselves well I don't
[1:42:02] know what that means
[1:42:06] one one minister in a denomination
[1:42:12] he said he had some idea I won't go into
[1:42:15] forsake a time I won't read it all yeah
[1:42:19] but he he put his idea of what the the
[1:42:22] beasts around the throne were yeah
[1:42:28] he's like oh the line is because there
[1:42:30] is courage
[1:42:32] [Applause]
[1:42:37] he was thinking you know what's the wing
[1:42:39] it's the eagle it's the wings of eagles
[1:42:41] that bring us towards heaven
[1:42:44] try and come up with some idea of what
[1:42:47] they think it is
[1:42:50] it's a corrupter yeah
[1:42:54] that's right amen
[1:42:57] in Israeli the Ark of the Covenant
[1:43:02] I was in the temple
[1:43:05] there were four the the Israel was it
[1:43:08] was it was placed around the Tabernacle
[1:43:10] oh they said
[1:43:13] there were three tribes on this side is
[1:43:52] foreign foreign
[1:44:49] all right Amina
[1:44:51] and so he goes to his Stables
[1:44:58] he says all right
[1:45:00] he bridles up
[1:45:07] a white horse
[1:45:13] says I need you to ride okay
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:22] to combat the word
[1:45:28] she says I need you to ride
[1:45:32] he leads out this white innocent looking
[1:45:34] horse
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:44] and Satan says I got an answer
[1:45:48] and so he gets and he straddles he gets
[1:45:50] up on that horse
[1:45:54] foreign
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:43] and so he starts to ride at times
[1:46:46] starting to feed out teaching that time
[1:46:49] the cocoa
[1:46:51] that was contrary to the word of God is
[1:46:54] that is
[1:46:56] the devil is subtle
[1:47:00] he's a planner yeah
[1:47:04] who plays the game of chess
[1:47:09] I think there's somebody in Uganda that
[1:47:12] was like a super duper chess champion
[1:47:16] yeah it was a young lady right
[1:47:20] I know more than you about Jason
[1:47:25] it's strategy
[1:47:29] I'm gonna put my you know my my Pawn
[1:47:36] here's just looking for a Checkmate
[1:47:42] and so he sends out his power
[1:47:47] foreign
[1:48:05] and now the ultimate goal is
[1:48:09] to remove life
[1:48:12] out of God's Church
[1:48:16] his ultimate goal is to make you cold
[1:48:29] and so he starts to shift well that's
[1:48:32] not exactly maybe what it means
[1:48:38] you start to pervert the word of God in
[1:48:41] your own thinking
[1:48:44] well I don't know if that's really what
[1:48:47] it means
[1:48:50] you have now injected
[1:48:54] your own image of what you think this
[1:48:57] message is
[1:49:03] you have raised up an idol that's
[1:49:17] what he's trying to do yeah see it's
[1:49:19] just not that way he just said time to
[1:49:21] check us out
[1:49:23] exactly the way
[1:49:27] not your own ideas
[1:49:39] but that white horse went out to ride
[1:49:44] conquer the church
[1:49:47] and cease the life force from it
[1:49:52] yes I mean it happened
[1:49:55] but God said
[1:49:57] that's okay I
[1:50:00] I see Satan trying to ride
[1:50:03] [Applause]
[1:50:04] he's like I got a power too
[1:50:08] I can release something too
[1:50:11] and so he calls for a lion
[1:50:15] he says Satan just released his White
[1:50:17] Horse
[1:50:22] he's trying to pervert my words
[1:50:26] but I have something to come back
[1:50:29] bring out a lion
[1:50:32] and now send my word for it
[1:50:35] and that lion anointing started to
[1:50:37] descend upon the apostles
[1:50:43] because it was gonna spread forth that
[1:50:46] true word of God
[1:50:50] force and strength
[1:50:54] amen scripture says in Acts
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:31] [Applause]
[1:51:55] says the lion happened Amina
[1:52:21] come on you're like who is this guy
[1:52:24] this is an illiterate fisherman
[1:52:27] he doesn't even know how to sign his
[1:52:29] name
[1:52:32] area ain't God don't really care what
[1:52:35] you know can I turned that tough fight I
[1:52:37] can't sign your name
[1:52:42] and you go forward
[1:52:49] hey man Amina he stood boldly in the
[1:52:52] face of the world at that time
[1:52:58] hey you're in Africa you know what lions
[1:53:01] are Africa
[1:53:03] they ain't afraid of nothing yeah
[1:53:08] that's right they walk like they own the
[1:53:11] jungle
[1:53:13] because they're kingaka
[1:53:18] and that's why that Spirit descended
[1:53:21] power to send it
[1:53:24] on Paul and Silas
[1:53:27] there they were chained up
[1:53:31] their arms chained to the ground
[1:53:36] oh but they started to praise
[1:53:41] of Crisis oh cookies
[1:53:45] of disaster
[1:53:49] they weren't running away
[1:53:52] they weren't Frozen
[1:53:55] What do we do
[1:53:57] now a boldness came about them
[1:54:03] they said these circumstances don't
[1:54:05] bother us
[1:54:07] what happened
[1:54:10] that jail shook apart
[1:54:13] [Applause]
[1:54:17] it was the lion demonstrating its might
[1:54:20] yeah it is
[1:54:25] amen Amina
[1:54:29] brother Branham says that Antichrist was
[1:54:33] writing his false teaching
[1:54:37] God he's teaching tooth
[1:54:42] the lion of the tribe of Judah Emperor
[1:54:45] because the word made manifests
[1:54:50] he says that's the reason the early
[1:54:52] church had healings and miracles
[1:54:59] Visions in power or
[1:55:05] let me help let's go to battle
[1:55:08] amen I'm in now
[1:55:11] he says it's because it was a living
[1:55:13] word
[1:55:16] in the form of the Lion of the tribe of
[1:55:18] Judah
[1:55:19] writing out to come back
[1:55:23] now you got it
[1:55:25] he sends his power to my mind again the
[1:55:30] antichristo God sends his word
[1:55:33] um
[1:55:36] [Music]
[1:55:38] they Clash amen amen
[1:55:43] he says I think the disciples in the
[1:55:45] early days
[1:55:47] no
[1:55:55] degrees Divine has a degree no
[1:55:57] denomination
[1:56:00] one thing
[1:56:02] that was the Holy Spirit
[1:56:04] that they received
[1:56:08] they didn't need nothing else amen
[1:56:24] what a time that was when the lion was
[1:56:26] roaring
[1:56:28] amen Peter and John better nail gun
[1:56:31] walking through the gate beautiful
[1:56:39] here was a beggar on the side of the
[1:56:40] street
[1:56:48] Peter says pets I don't have silver
[1:56:55] I don't have anything of that nature
[1:56:58] I can imagine Satan was looking down on
[1:57:01] that moment
[1:57:03] he'd sent out his White Horse
[1:57:07] here now he was looking at an instance
[1:57:09] down there
[1:57:12] he's saying what's this what exactly is
[1:57:15] happening
[1:57:17] Peter says
[1:57:23] [Applause]
[1:57:27] Jesus Christ
[1:57:29] Satan didn't even know what to do
[1:57:32] something just happened right devil that
[1:57:36] was a Power
[1:57:37] released into a piece
[1:57:39] of the Antichrist amen
[1:57:42] [Applause]
[1:57:49] [Applause]
[1:57:51] you know what brother Brown said
[1:57:53] he said one hundredth
[1:57:57] chikumi in the Jays of the lion Monaco
[1:58:01] is power was released
[1:58:05] 100th of them
[1:58:15] 100.
[1:58:20] Satan said my goodness what do I do
[1:58:24] I need to change my tactic
[1:58:30] so he goes back to his tablet
[1:58:37] and he pulls out another horse
[1:58:41] another Power
[1:58:42] he leads out
[1:58:45] all right
[1:58:49] I can deal with this
[1:58:52] so he jumps off the white another
[1:59:03] Brandon says a red horse
[1:59:06] his rider Goes Forth
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:11] same one yeah just another Power he's
[1:59:14] riding um
[1:59:17] a power given to him
[1:59:21] with a great sword
[1:59:24] he said this is Satan again
[1:59:27] that's the devil in another form yes
[1:59:30] said it's a man this man has a sword
[1:59:34] he says it pertains to the church
[1:59:37] said it's a political war
[1:59:41] and he said it changed from the innocent
[1:59:43] white
[1:59:47] to a bloody red
[1:59:52] is it all right if you're not gonna
[1:59:54] believe my perversion
[1:59:57] what can you just take my little my
[1:59:59] little tweets
[2:00:02] I'll just wipe them out
[2:00:11] and one
[2:00:14] Satan starts to destroy
[2:00:18] God's people I went to back 68 million
[2:00:22] Martyrs
[2:00:25] hundreds after hundreds
[2:00:28] a spiritual disaster
[2:00:34] who was upon the Earth
[2:00:37] that's right Amina
[2:00:39] and the Antichrist then went from Spirit
[2:00:41] went from Deeds to a Doctrine
[2:00:47] crowning a false prophet now
[2:00:50] church and state now had power echanism
[2:00:56] [Music]
[2:01:03] foreign
[2:01:11] I'll bring out my power
[2:01:16] amen I know exactly what's needed
[2:01:19] I know exactly what is needed
[2:01:23] I know how to react to this
[2:01:26] so as the enemy enemy's tactic shifted
[2:01:31] God said that's okay
[2:01:34] I have another anointing
[2:01:38] that I can send to my people
[2:01:41] and so out went forth the anointing of
[2:01:44] an
[2:01:47] Oxi and willingly
[2:01:51] one by one
[2:01:54] they were kicking and screaming
[2:01:57] they were fighting it
[2:02:01] they willingly went to this
[2:02:05] into the arena they went Parker
[2:02:12] to the stake they went never again
[2:02:20] in fact there was an account of one
[2:02:22] sister
[2:02:24] her name was
[2:02:26] [Music]
[2:02:28] this just gives you an idea of the
[2:02:30] anointing
[2:02:35] that was inside
[2:02:37] they didn't even know what they were
[2:02:39] doing
[2:02:40] how it switched from a lion anointing to
[2:02:43] an auction
[2:02:49] that's okay
[2:02:51] my savior demands me to live lay my life
[2:02:54] down
[2:02:58] and this one lady he's a little sister
[2:03:02] she was there in prison she had been put
[2:03:04] in prison for for being a Christian
[2:03:08] I won't go in all details
[2:03:11] but here she was she had a little baby
[2:03:16] and she who she was they were her father
[2:03:19] was just so dismayed and she was trying
[2:03:21] to make her to
[2:03:23] recanted
[2:03:26] trying to tell her you just stop being a
[2:03:29] Christian
[2:03:31] just recant of this
[2:03:36] she pointed to a vase yes
[2:03:41] um
[2:03:42] like a like a a ball a yes
[2:03:48] she said what is this Dad
[2:03:52] he said well that's a that's a ball
[2:03:55] she says it can't stop being what it is
[2:04:03] I can't just give up
[2:04:07] I'm not a Christian anymore
[2:04:10] it doesn't work that way
[2:04:12] something inside of her
[2:04:15] driving her edge
[2:04:19] it says I must if I must lay my life
[2:04:24] and they're inside the prison with her
[2:04:27] was another little another sister
[2:04:32] is pregnant
[2:04:35] and she was almost ready to deliver
[2:04:38] and she was so distraught
[2:04:44] because she was worried
[2:04:46] that she would not be able to give her
[2:04:49] life
[2:04:51] because they wouldn't send her to the
[2:04:54] arena being pregnant
[2:05:07] she prayed that she would give birth yes
[2:05:12] so that she could join her fellow
[2:05:15] Christians
[2:05:17] at the appointed day what you said
[2:05:21] he gave birth
[2:05:25] she gave birth and joined perpetua
[2:05:31] and they stood there
[2:05:34] as the the wild beast got in Solo in
[2:05:38] Cambridge
[2:05:39] tried to consume them
[2:05:43] which it didn't it just it just hurt
[2:05:45] them
[2:05:46] it hurt them
[2:05:49] and so they had to bring out some
[2:05:50] Gladiators
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:05:53] I'm just showing you the power you say
[2:05:56] how could they do that
[2:05:58] your mind is telling you right now I
[2:06:01] don't even know if I could do that
[2:06:05] it's okay
[2:06:07] foreign
[2:06:13] I'll let you hold that thought we'll get
[2:06:15] there
[2:06:19] and now can
[2:06:24] you cut me down and Perpetual they had
[2:06:26] knelt down
[2:06:28] and the soldiers that came to take her
[2:06:31] life
[2:06:35] was a novice
[2:06:38] and he struck her with his sword yeah
[2:06:43] foreign
[2:07:54] amen
[2:07:56] Satan is like what is going on said it
[2:07:59] was attaching in the muscle for every
[2:08:01] one I killed there's a hundred more
[2:08:02] behind them
[2:08:05] how could this be
[2:08:08] Italian
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:12] he couldn't figure it out
[2:08:15] it enraged him
[2:08:19] as he tried to stomp out everything is
[2:08:23] [Applause]
[2:08:25] good man
[2:08:28] brother Branham says in the days of the
[2:08:30] oxente
[2:08:35] just a teeny little drop a cartoon
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:50] God doesn't need many
[2:08:55] you just need one to plant his seed into
[2:08:57] it
[2:09:02] so Satan's getting really frustrated
[2:09:06] he's like I forced Millions to recanted
[2:09:15] so I gotta go back to my stable you know
[2:09:17] who died
[2:09:21] I gotta figure out what to do here
[2:09:24] every time I bring one out
[2:09:27] every time
[2:09:29] [Applause]
[2:09:30] my enemy sends out something greater
[2:09:37] you think Satan would have learned by
[2:09:38] now huh you get up nope
[2:09:43] so he goes back to this is
[2:09:56] it we have just a little strength
[2:10:00] Dark Age
[2:10:03] it was midnight for them
[2:10:06] for the True Believer
[2:10:09] Catholicism had taken over
[2:10:13] all that didn't agree with Catholicism
[2:10:15] was killed
[2:10:21] he said in his black horse
[2:10:24] [Applause]
[2:10:25] starts to ride
[2:10:29] I'm sure Satan thought victory was close
[2:10:45] he corrupted it so much
[2:10:48] now he starts charging for prayers
[2:10:54] indulgences
[2:10:59] the Holy Eucharist
[2:11:03] this is the literal blood and Body of
[2:11:05] Christ
[2:11:15] that's why it was a black horse
[2:11:20] is capturing the wealth of the world
[2:11:26] he says the scale weighing out if you go
[2:11:29] into scripture how the scripture reads
[2:11:33] measure of wheat for a penny
[2:11:38] which three measures of body for a penny
[2:11:41] if you guys say it if you are centered
[2:11:43] brother Branham said he was stripping
[2:11:45] his subjects of their money
[2:11:50] you say well that's a long time ago
[2:11:53] no that is still happening
[2:11:59] you know that to remain in good standing
[2:12:01] as a good Catholic
[2:12:05] you have to confess your sins once a
[2:12:07] year

[2:12:10] come on
[2:12:12] yeah
[2:12:13] okay if you want to be a good Catholic
[2:12:15] once a year you have to confess yourself
[2:12:18] my goodness Paul says I died daily yeah
[2:12:25] he says it but in a survey done
[2:12:28] a couple years ago
[2:12:32] three quarters of Catholics a return to
[2:12:35] me
[2:12:38] said they go to confession less than
[2:12:41] once a year again
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:48] or not even at all
[2:12:50] [Applause]
[2:12:54] so now you can get a partial Indulgence
[2:12:58] [Applause]
[2:12:59] to reduce your time in purgatory
[2:13:01] [Applause]
[2:13:10] you know they outlawed indulgences in
[2:13:12] 1567.
[2:13:18] I was back at Martin Luther's days
[2:13:23] but you know now you can make a donation
[2:13:29] and so you know if you give some
[2:13:30] donations you can limit you know and you
[2:13:33] know some Indulgence kind of a one they
[2:13:35] call it a plenary Indulgence per sinner
[2:13:37] it still happens today
[2:13:42] you think that power isn't riding it was
[2:13:45] riding and it still has Contin
[2:13:52] and it stripped the people to

[2:14:17] [Music]
[2:14:33] Brilliant Minds of language

[2:14:48] church
[2:14:52] can you imagine terrorism
[2:14:55] the Catholic Church
[2:14:57] back in the 1500s this was the
[2:14:59] dominating Force
[2:15:06] I'd say you're almost insane to try and
[2:15:09] go against them
[2:15:16] but
[2:15:18] he didn't even know yeah
[2:15:21] look around this is crazy
[2:15:27] this isn't what it says in the scripture
[2:15:31] the people don't have the scriptures
[2:15:34] they need to be able to read the
[2:15:36] scriptures
[2:15:37] this is false Doctrine
[2:15:40] and God gave him the ability to
[2:15:42] translate

[2:15:46] put it into the word into German
[2:15:49] you get it in English
