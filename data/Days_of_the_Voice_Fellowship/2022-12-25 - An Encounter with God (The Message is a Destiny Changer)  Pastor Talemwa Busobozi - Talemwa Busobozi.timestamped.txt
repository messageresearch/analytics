[15:33] tonight
[15:40] [Music]
[15:48] we are just in the practice
[15:53] I'd like to appreciate Pastor Joseph and
[15:55] type for the for inviting us
[15:59] and also for pre uh preparing this these
[16:03] conventions I heard about that saying
[16:04] that this is not
[16:06] um uh evening evening light bright
[16:09] Tabernacle conventional
[16:27] I'd like also to bring uh greetings from
[16:30] Kenya Kenya
[16:33] um by God is Grace no it's such a
[16:36] cartoon I was in Kenya this uh the
[16:39] beginning actually when the conversion
[16:41] here was starting we were also starting
[16:42] the other side
[16:45] a
[16:51] he usually we usually have been
[16:53] participating in that confession over
[16:54] there around this time of the year
[16:58] so this time we were there apart and
[17:01] then we came here to also participate in
[17:03] this world
[17:07] so they sent
[17:09] in Kenya sent you greetings
[17:13] so we just arrived very early in the
[17:16] morning today at home
[17:18] after taking three meetings so you can
[17:21] imagine I might be wearing the body but
[17:23] I believe it's not me you're going to
[17:25] hear from but from the Lord
[17:31] so I would like to also check this
[17:33] opportunity to thank God for pastor Leo
[17:40] I did not know that he was the day
[17:41] manager today but I
[17:45] was honored that he invited me on the
[17:48] pulpit
[17:50] [Music]
[17:52] because he's my pastor
[17:54] [Music]
[17:55] amen Mina like he said we
[17:59] I've believed and preached this message
[18:01] for a little over 15 years
[18:06] but more than half of that time I was
[18:09] myself and my wife my young family were
[18:13] in Ethiopia
[18:16] but the first time we went to Ethiopia
[18:18] was for our honeymoon
[18:25] there was no established message church
[18:28] at the time you can say
[18:32] but I'm happy to see uh brother
[18:35] Zaid I think that's the right name
[18:39] the first person who welcomed me at the
[18:41] airport was a Zimbabwean brother
[18:49] and so we by God is Grace now there are
[18:52] two churches in Ethiopia in different
[18:54] cities
[18:58] the church which we you know pastored
[19:01] for uh for some years now is pastored by
[19:04] an Ethiopian brother
[19:09] and the other Church there is no pasta
[19:11] yet but there's a brother who is also
[19:13] helping
[19:16] and the Lord has been good
[19:18] amen Amina
[19:21] so uh like the pastor Leo said the Lord
[19:25] now I want it before we get into the
[19:27] world so you get to you know know me
[19:29] just a little bit
[19:32] so you don't get to figure me out you
[19:34] know before we get it
[19:37] so uh for for assist before I think just
[19:42] shortly before Coffee started
[19:45] he returned back to Uganda
[19:48] Uganda and the Lord sent us to the
[19:50] namongo area
[19:53] you know our sister you know believed
[19:55] miraculously you know um long story but
[19:58] I want to go into that
[19:59] and she believed the message
[20:03] and was at the time working in Ethiopia
[20:08] Ethiopia and so after we baptized
[20:11] and she invited us to come and minister
[20:14] to her people in some Congo area
[20:20] and I go to London there was no
[20:22] Fellowship
[20:24] so you really felt Baden to come and
[20:26] help
[20:28] and so we started the fellowship in our
[20:30] house
[20:32] I think a little about a year and a half
[20:35] ago
[20:36] and now I should say that the Lord has
[20:39] been good because now we have a
[20:40] congregation Gathering uh in namgongo
[20:43] area
[20:47] I expected several of them to be here if
[20:50] you're from Days of the voice Fellowship
[20:51] can you please stand up
[20:54] the voice
[20:56] all right I mean right there
[21:26] three girls and two boys
[21:31] and God has blessed me also with other
[21:33] children other boys that I uh my father
[21:36] I don't know where they are also
[21:38] conditions
[21:41] yes that is shame that is
[21:47] amen Amina praise the name of the Lord
[21:52] after being fathered by a priest in the
[21:55] Anglican Church
[21:56] [Music]
[22:01] um my mother also ministering in the to
[22:03] pretend there is a Revival
[22:07] they raised me to be a preacher of the
[22:09] Gospel
[22:13] and uh they raised me to be a preacher
[22:16] of the Gospel
[22:17] because they thought that I had a
[22:19] calling on my life
[22:22] so when I became 13 years old
[22:26] he went to live with the shape of the
[22:28] Anglican church
[22:33] and uh I I stepped on my Pulpit for my
[22:37] first time
[22:39] at 13 years old
[22:41] and ever since then I I have been
[22:44] preaching the the gospel
[22:47] foreign
[23:22] and that family friend happened to be a
[23:24] pastor in this message
[23:27] and so I want to live with them
[23:31] self and his wife
[23:33] and so we lived with them for some years
[23:37] but in the first six months
[23:45] and this is important to me because it's
[23:48] going to this is the background of the
[23:50] message I'm going to preach to you this
[23:51] morning
[23:52] [Music]
[23:54] I wanted to be a bishop in the Anglican
[23:57] Church that was my dreams
[24:00] I had the means because the bishop and
[24:04] the current at that time the Archbishop
[24:07] they had met with me and they had
[24:09] promised me to take me to uh to Maryland
[24:12] to start a Theology
[24:21] and you know I was used to living a life
[24:23] a luxurious life
[24:25] [Music]
[24:30] and you know eating good food
[24:33] sitting on high tables
[24:37] and Bishops and things
[24:40] but when the Lord moved me
[24:43] and put me in a little place
[24:46] that these people we are gathering were
[24:49] just about 10 or 15 and gathering in a
[24:51] very shanty house
[24:55] supposedly to be despised but the Lord
[24:58] had other plans for my life
[25:01] and they there's an a brother called by
[25:04] the poor
[25:05] and the past at that time
[25:08] they would start to preach to me and
[25:10] preach to me
[25:12] all the doctrines of the message
[25:15] but you see I try to run away from it
[25:18] could be do come but I couldn't run away
[25:20] because there was another Destiny
[25:24] other than the one I had envisioned for
[25:26] myself
[25:28] and so um long story short
[25:32] one day I would now be going to our
[25:35] church
[25:36] very early in the morning and because I
[25:39] live at a pastor's house
[25:41] I had to go to their church after our
[25:44] church
[25:47] they prayed for longer
[25:52] so those long prayers are very good
[25:54] because they helped me
[25:57] so then one day in our church
[26:05] as the woman who preacher was preaching
[26:09] and then after she preached then they
[26:13] told us to look I don't remember which
[26:15] direction
[26:16] and we started singing the Apostles
[26:19] Creed
[26:21] and as we were rehearsing it
[26:26] words that said and I believe in the
[26:28] Holy Catholic Church
[26:30] [Music]
[26:32] so I said to myself
[26:36] am I a Catholic I remember the words
[26:39] brother Paula told me that you are a
[26:40] Catholic
[26:42] and I told him no I'm angry
[26:45] which means I'm a Protestant but he said
[26:49] no you were catholic
[26:51] so when I heard those words
[26:54] I just knew that indeed I was a Catholic
[26:58] I was a part of the Roman system
[27:01] and then they started baptizing a baby
[27:03] there in the rear of the church
[27:14] and then it turned out that they started
[27:16] baptizing the baby
[27:18] using the water the holy water
[27:22] is the name of this and while the priest
[27:25] was the woman priest was still speaking
[27:28] at that time at that moment
[27:31] something happened
[27:33] that changed my entire Destiny
[27:39] I I had a wall I did not know it's
[27:41] called
[27:45] you know but when I I later believe the
[27:47] message I read you know and also in the
[27:49] Book of Job it's called a whirlwind
[27:55] [Music]
[28:01] like I was losing balance and a voice
[28:05] out of it spoke to me
[28:10] find the nearest exit and leave this
[28:12] place
[28:14] cause you are in the wrong place
[28:17] I tell you friends I heard that voice
[28:21] I had had the message for six months
[28:25] and I was determined to stay in my
[28:27] church
[28:28] but when I had that voice
[28:32] I was almost passing out I picked my
[28:35] Bible and just swung myself
[28:39] and then I had nowhere to go
[29:11] [Music]
[29:32] [Music]
[29:35] and
[29:39] those things really touched my heart
[30:00] and when the wall of wind came back
[30:05] [Music]
[30:20] this message is true
[30:27] and also asked to be baptized
[30:31] in the name of our Lord
[30:36] now that was not written in here
[30:39] but I had it
[30:42] and this is a true witness
[30:45] and at that moment
[30:47] those people who were there some of them
[30:50] I believe they are here they will also
[30:52] Testify the Lord
[30:54] at that moment
[30:59] you know they said both my hands but I
[31:01] raised
[31:03] that's why preachers I believe we should
[31:05] be patient with people when we are doing
[31:07] an articles
[31:18] [Music]
[31:20] I have I believe this message is the
[31:22] truth
[31:23] and I've decided to be baptized in the
[31:27] name of our Lord
[31:29] and uh people shouted on top of their
[31:33] voice
[31:33] [Music]
[31:48] in the name of our Lord Jesus
[31:52] and ever since that moment
[31:55] when I came out of the water I pledged
[31:58] my life
[32:07] [Music]
[32:16] and that's what I've come here to do
[32:18] just to testify the message is true
[32:23] foreign
[32:52] foreign
[33:02] [Music]
[33:06] and so this morning this afternoon
[33:08] I see I have about an hour or so I would
[33:11] like to speak to you on an encounter
[33:13] with God
[33:15] and for inspiration just something I
[33:18] feel to you know touch on is the gospel
[33:24] the message is a destiny change
[33:31] I wonder if we can stand on our feet
[33:36] foreign
[33:49] [Music]
[34:03] just take verses 39.
[34:09] Luke chapter 23 we'll just read verse
[34:11] 39-43
[34:18] amen Amina
[34:22] and one of the male factors which were
[34:25] hanged railed on him saying if thou be
[34:28] Christ save thyself and us
[34:32] but they are the answering
[34:34] rebuked him saying does not thou fear
[34:39] God seeing without in the same
[34:41] condemnation
[34:43] and we indeed and we indeed justly
[34:48] for we receive
[34:50] uh the due reward of our Deeds but this
[34:54] man has done nothing amiss
[34:57] and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me
[35:00] when thou cometh into thy kingdom
[35:04] and Jesus said unto him verily I say
[35:08] unto you
[35:10] today
[35:11] today
[35:13] shalt thou be with me in Paradise
[35:17] amen Brothers
[35:20] at the moment

[36:40] Gentiles
[36:42] are not only numbered foreign
[37:18] [Music]
[37:40] [Music]
[37:55] an encounter with God
[37:58] for the message now here in my notes I
[38:01] put the gospel but as I was coming I
[38:03] thought inspired to say the message
[38:13] praise the name of the Lord now each of
[38:16] us no doubt at one time we have had an
[38:18] encounter
[38:18] [Music]
[38:20] and while we live in this Earth
[38:23] You are going to have an encounter okay
[38:27] if you don't have an encounter with God
[38:29] you are going to have an encounter with
[38:31] the devil
[38:31] [Music]
[38:34] and there are many people who would even
[38:36] sit in church pews and they do that week
[38:38] after week after weeks
[38:42] but you know it has come to a place
[38:45] where it has become a religion
[39:41] [Applause]
[39:46] foreign foreign
[40:11] [Applause]
[40:36] and I've asked many young people
[40:38] and I've asked them when did you believe
[40:41] the message
[40:44] and I will say yes
[40:50] from since I was a boy
[40:52] I was born in the message
[40:55] listen my brother if you are here oh my
[40:58] sister
[40:59] I wish I was born in the message
[41:08] this is nothing about your parents
[41:15] and that is
[41:26] foreign
[41:31] [Music]
[42:00] [Music]
[42:04] if your Christ service
[42:06] and save yourself

[42:12] these two thieves on the cross
[42:15] I know the picture we have them in our
[42:19] minds of them in their minds
[42:23] we thank God they were so bad but let me
[42:26] tell you they were representing us
[42:31] foreign
[43:14] [Music]
[43:45] listen we didn't destined to go to hell
[43:49] no I'm against
[43:51] and unless
[43:53] something happening
[43:57] there ought to be something that had to
[44:00] happen
[44:04] that's why the Bible says and prophets
[44:08] in the Book of Genesis
[44:31] and that's what Jesus was
[44:33] today people are celebrating Christmas
[44:36] you don't even know what it is
[44:45] because they don't understand
[44:47] this is about Jesus Christ
[44:57] foreign
[45:53] because in a message the tokens
[45:58] we are not to come together to talk
[46:00] about the message
[46:03] we have not come here to talk about it
[46:07] because we know what it is
[46:11] but we have come together
[46:17] we have because it says the message is
[46:20] Christ
[46:21] [Music]
[46:23] he is the living is the word
[46:26] that's right we are to get into it we
[46:30] have to get benefits

[46:40] foreign
[47:26] the seed of God cannot perish for sure
[47:30] you were born the stream for hell who
[47:33] was Daddy walking but because you are
[47:35] you were predestinated
[47:37] [Music]
[47:42] when you hear the message
[47:53] because you will fight now finally alive
[47:58] this has always been a part of you this
[48:01] is

[49:14] who are you trying to say why I left a
[49:18] message why I left a message you cannot
[49:21] leave the message
[49:23] because if you were predestinated the
[49:27] message is in you
[49:29] you cannot leave yourself because the
[49:33] message is
[49:36] Europe
[50:02] there is no other place
[50:04] hallelujah amen Peter and the rest of
[50:07] them they told Jesus
[50:15] life is in the message

[50:40] the cross
[50:41] and they hanged him they did not know he
[50:46] was later than they thought yeah
[50:52] and they asked him he would say they
[50:55] asked him he said the time for you to
[50:59] restore the kingdom
[51:06] [Music]
[52:00] but only that this was now a difference
[52:04] foreign
[52:29] [Music]
[52:42] Professor can be fulfilled right in your
[52:44] midst
[52:46] and you can miss it
[52:49] when you search the scriptures
[52:54] they say it tell us
[52:57] why what the scribes
[53:02] that Elijah will first come out
[53:05] because we have seen

[1:24:33] they think because they are not
[1:24:34] Pentecostals
[1:24:42] Pentecostals
[1:24:46] but for us we receive the word
[1:24:52] because we are not putting the word into

[1:25:01] I thank God for this meeting
[1:25:15] let me tell you to some of you who did
[1:25:17] not know
[1:25:20] they're over a thousand believes

[1:27:35] hallelujah amen
[1:27:38] praise the name of the Lord
[1:27:40] hallelujah hallelujah that's the truth
[1:27:45] I think things like this ought to be
[1:27:48] spoken on a convention
[1:27:50] and shy away from them
[1:27:55] foreign
[1:28:12] so who is going to be the preacheria
[1:28:15] let me say this when I was in Kenya when
[1:28:19] when birthday Kenya I met a pastor
[1:28:23] 81 years
[1:28:27] and I asked him he is old so he can no
[1:28:31] longer preach
[1:28:34] I felt bad but her heart is a powerful
[1:28:38] preacher
[1:28:39] and he was preaching until two years ago
[1:28:45] he sits on a chair
[1:28:48] but he tells he told me you can only
[1:28:50] preach for 30 minutes
[1:28:53] I don't think it will be preaching I
[1:28:55] think it will be speaking
[1:28:58] that's the truth because it doesn't have
[1:29:01] the strength
[1:29:05] but here's what I want to say no
[1:29:08] I'm not saying that that is bad he is
[1:29:12] doing his he's fulfilling his quality
[1:29:16] but I asked him a question with respect
[1:29:22] I said pasta what is your plan
[1:29:25] for Success
[1:29:28] you know he said I have no plan
[1:29:34] I said you have no plan
[1:29:37] so who preaches now
[1:29:40] since you told me you would last speech
[1:29:42] two years ago
[1:29:43] and he has a big challenge
[1:29:46] he told me
[1:29:50] um we have some brothers who are
[1:29:52] preaching
[1:29:54] as I told him why don't you have a plan
[1:29:57] of success
[1:30:13] for him
[1:30:17] that's your number
[1:30:20] it is time and she said you know we
[1:30:23] younger people
[1:30:25] accept to take the challenge
[1:30:31] has no plan for succession
[1:30:34] I don't know if that's the right word
[1:30:39] why doesn't he have a plan maybe because
[1:30:42] when he looks around
[1:30:44] so he looks around and says
[1:30:54] foreign
[1:31:31] hey I've had several times
[1:31:37] I spoke to her and she said she's not
[1:31:40] ready

[1:31:45] into the things
[1:31:50] where are we going
