[16:14] sound of my voice this morning
[16:17] let my mind Fade Away
[16:23] father we ask this blessing in the name
[16:26] of it
[16:28] I mean amen
[16:33] I'm going to invite you to your Bible
[16:38] in the book of Ephesians
[16:41] [Music]
[16:47] verses 5.
[17:13] Ephesians chapter 2.
[17:16] so but tonight we shall this morning we
[17:19] shall begin from today even when we were
[17:21] dead in sins as quickened us together
[17:25] with Christ by grace are ye saved and
[17:28] has raised us up together and made us
[17:30] sit together in Heavenly places in
[17:33] Christ Jesus
[17:36] yes
[17:56] for by grace are you saved
[18:01] through faith
[18:03] and that not of yourselves it is the
[18:07] gift of God
[18:13] is
[18:17] do we believe that
[18:21] do we believe that
[18:24] a lot of Works lest any man should boast
[18:34] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[18:38] which God has before ordained that we
[18:41] should walk in them yes
[18:56] I mean it may you may be seated
[19:01] so I'm speaking to you
[19:03] um and of course I want to Welcome All
[19:05] of You In The Name of Jesus
[19:08] Amen I'm sorry my mind is you know just
[19:12] focusing on the world
[19:17] Amen so I'm speaking to you on trophies
[19:19] of his grace
[19:34] [Music]
[19:35] they say one of the definition is a cup
[19:38] or other decorative objects awarded
[19:41] inclusion
[19:48] paid as a prize for a victory
[19:54] or success
[19:56] and
[20:00] the winner of the race usually gets a
[20:03] cup
[20:06] when they play football then the winner
[20:08] of the race gets a cup
[20:12] a surprise for their victory
[20:18] you can get a prize or a cup or
[20:20] something or just recognize your success
[20:28] and so
[20:30] um then in another definition this is
[20:32] according to ancient Rome uh and Greece
[20:36] trophy was weapons
[20:39] of a defeated army or questions
[20:43] [Music]
[20:50] we are looking at ancient Rome you know
[20:52] those who used to fight with swords
[20:58] and so now when they would go and fight
[21:02] an army
[21:04] and they defeat that amen then they
[21:08] would take all the weapons
[21:14] of that defeated
[21:17] and they would set it up in a place
[21:19] somewhere
[21:21] as a memorial of the victory
[21:26] praise the name of the Lord so these
[21:29] weapons
[21:30] were simply now there today display the
[21:33] mighty power of the of the Victorious
[21:36] Force
[21:45] the belt like the people who the
[21:48] Champions the the kickboxing
[21:51] um the Champions
[21:54] you know they they win belts
[21:58] and you know belt after belt after belt
[22:01] depending on how many times they win
[22:05] and you know it is it's not going to do
[22:08] anything with it really
[22:11] it is a sign of his victory
[22:16] it is uh it shows uh how great it is
[22:23] it's an outcome of the fighter he fought
[22:29] and therefore he will treasure it
[22:54] and so of course you are not going to go
[22:57] out there and then come back full of
[22:59] blood and say I've killed a hundred or
[23:01] some men
[23:02] again
[23:06] you have to come back with the trophies
[23:09] of your Victory
[23:12] and that was the heads of those that is
[24:15] [Music]
[24:22] and actually Christianity has been
[24:24] turned into a place where men try to
[24:28] work their own salvation
[24:36] did you know the major difference
[24:38] between Christianity and Islam
[24:45] Islam to be able to go to Jannah
[24:48] you have to kill some infidels
[24:52] you have to do certain things
[24:55] that's why the very very specific with
[24:58] their prayer times
[25:02] you have to pray at a certain time
[25:05] three times a day you know you have to
[25:09] do this
[25:10] and if you do all those things
[25:14] collectively depending on how much you
[25:16] have done
[25:19] it can buy you a journal
[25:33] we are trophies
[26:20] [Applause]
[26:35] something to boost
[27:35] [Music]
[28:05] [Music]
[28:30] we all walked according to the course of
[28:33] this world
[28:37] walking according to the prince of the
[28:39] power of the air in the two times
[28:42] we all fulfill the desires of the flesh
[28:47] no listen we all fulfill the desires of
[28:50] the mind
[28:52] is that true is that true church we were
[28:57] all by Nature friends
[29:02] so in other words
[29:10] being God at his throne in heaven
[29:15] she left his powers
[29:22] only to come down here
[29:25] on Earth foreign
[30:26] Jesus was
[30:33] God himself yes
[31:01] and the word was
[31:11] put on
[31:13] next
[31:15] so what who is the word
[31:18] god cartoon now God cartoon put on yeah
[31:25] if you understand it say amen I mean god
[31:30] cartoon put on flesh and he came among
[31:33] us
[31:34] but when people never recognized him
[31:38] they never understood who he was but he
[31:42] was the god of Glory
[31:47] he came down from Glory
[31:50] Faith one baptism
[31:57] so if Jehovah God in the Old Testament
[32:00] was Lord
[32:03] and Jesus is Lord
[32:05] that simply means
[32:09] became Jesus
[32:11] the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[32:14] the Jesus of the New Testament yes
[32:20] why would he do that why would he humble
[32:24] himself
[32:25] it is right there in verse 7. it says
[32:30] that in ages to come
[32:34] the exceeding Riches of his grace
[32:41] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[32:44] Christ
[32:46] [Music]
[32:47] tell someone he wanted to show back
[32:53] he wanted to show his infinite grace
[32:57] I pray that God will give you an
[33:00] inspiration to understand what I'm
[33:01] speaking about
[33:04] proof of his grace
[33:08] you know his purpose
[33:11] has been you know to be able to to say
[33:15] I point at something
[33:18] pointed at someone
[33:23] look at my infinite grace
[33:31] how could he do that yes when he was in
[33:34] heaven how could you show his grace
[33:38] what is Grace
[33:41] unmerited favor hey Jesus
[34:02] the Bible says
[34:08] and is God by himself he does what he
[34:12] wants to do no one questions

[34:22] God is only to be believed
[34:27] that's why we are believers
[34:30] we are believers we don't question
[34:36] how many believers do I have in the
[34:39] sanctuary
[34:40] we believe God
[34:45] being god
[34:47] without sin to come in the Garden of
[34:50] Eden yeah
[34:53] if you can have a lot of questions there
[34:57] that's why we need to learn to believe
[34:59] him
[35:01] we need always to give our battles to
[35:04] him he has to fight them yeah
[35:09] my battle is the Lord is
[35:17] higher than the stars of God
[35:21] said no I can't let this happen
[35:28] Michael Go and show him so Michael came
[35:31] by the authority of God Amen
[35:37] the Bible says
[36:39] and when he came Hallelujah

[37:56] God knows all things

[38:01] planning against my life
[38:05] and I also know God has a solution
[38:10] for what the devil is planning against
[38:13] HIV
[38:15] why did God let the devil come right
[38:18] because he wanted to manifest
[38:22] you know he overcame the devil yeah I'm
[38:25] gonna sit down but you see you never how
[38:28] can God come down

[41:23] but wait a moment God let that happen
[41:27] there is something that God knew that
[41:30] the devil did know

[45:19] weapon in this case a weapon of um of
[45:22] the of the memories
[45:37] [Music]
[45:48] that changes men and women
[45:55] foreign
[46:11] [Music]
[46:50] [Music]
[46:59] anything a child of God will say
[47:03] and you fight against number one
[47:06] you you cast it or whatever it is you
[47:10] will never be forgiven
[47:11] someone said what is that scripture
[47:14] whatever is done or said against the
[47:16] Holy Spirit
[47:21] that's the only sin it should change
[47:30] where is the holy spirit today
[47:34] it is
[48:05] you shall be received
[48:10] whoever rejects you I never go back
[48:13] shake off the
[48:16] dusted
[48:21] it's a strong strong force
[48:25] that's why don't anger a child of God
[48:30] you remember in the Bible we find that
[48:33] there was Elisha he was the son of God
[48:35] when he was angered you know he he out
[48:39] of anger he called Bears simply because
[48:43] the children were laughing at him at his
[48:45] bone here
[48:48] and he called she bears
[48:51] from the forest movies
[48:57] that's why it is very very serious
[49:02] when you are standing or speaking to a
[49:05] child of God
[49:06] I'm not talking about preachers I'm
[49:09] talking about the blood boat
[49:13] and when you know that also
[49:19] power
[49:20] that can change things
[49:23] even certain times when things don't
[49:26] happen the way you expected
[49:30] you can speak something and it happens
[49:33] to somebody
[49:35] without you know

[50:13] the life that was in Christ
[50:20] I am telling you of your place and
[50:22] position in Christ
[50:26] that's why if Christians knew this is
[50:31] rushing to so-called men of God to
[50:34] anoint them with oil and cast out demons
[50:35] and rather and you know cast out casters
[50:43] the Bible says in the Book of Mark
[50:46] chapter 16. because the sign shall
[50:49] follow them that believe
[50:53] not essential for the prophets

[51:57] life that was in Christ
[52:03] when he was on Earth
[52:05] which life was in him
[52:09] God his own life
[52:12] you could forgive sins he says
[52:26] to forgive sins but you have that life
[52:30] you're just not exercising
[52:34] a woman would come with an adultery
[52:38] and he stopped it
[52:41] with a supernatural
[52:45] his life
[52:48] if his life is in you
[52:51] all the sinners
[53:00] because they will realize
[53:10] [Music]
[53:16] [Music]
[53:24] that's the same life that is
[53:30] hallelujah amen I said Hallelujah
[53:34] the life that was in crisis in you the
[53:37] mind that wasn't in crisis in you and
[53:39] there was a Christian

[53:54] through Christ you are sealed there by
[53:58] the holy
[54:00] ghosts

[54:11] you see
[54:15] 31
[54:16] he wants was not responsible

[54:28] non-effects

[54:32] you could say oh yes I believe it
[54:35] but that didn't do it
[54:39] I will tell you what I will do
[54:42] I'll put it in a bucket buckets

[1:10:01] he was he was ruling a very vast Kingdom
[1:10:06] half of the Earth
[1:10:09] was the king of kings
[1:10:12] and before I continue I wanted to
[1:10:14] understand that is a type of Christ
[1:10:22] you know the Bible is not a Bible it's
[1:10:24] not a book of History
[1:10:28] it has the things people are reading
[1:10:32] it has the meaning behind us
[1:10:36] but the children of God are given that
[1:10:39] deep food
[1:11:40] they are
[1:12:09] to marry another woman
[1:12:13] foreign
[1:13:35] all I want is Jesus Christ
[1:13:39] and this this chamberlains
[1:13:46] oh seven Church age Messengers

[1:15:53] something here
[1:15:54] to the book of Ephesians
[1:16:00] I want you to see a little bit about
[1:16:02] Gracia before I conclude
[1:16:05] as he has chosen Us in him
[1:16:10] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:13] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:16:16] before him
[1:16:22] you know when you talk about his
[1:16:24] exceeding reaches
[1:16:30] Riches of Gaga who can you define as a
[1:16:33] rich man

[1:16:40] how much Mecca
[1:16:43] anyway

[1:16:52] and he can't confide
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:43] so that I might receive Grace
[1:17:47] according as he has chosen me in him
[1:17:54] for the foundation of the world
[1:17:57] some people think that they can actually
[1:18:01] sin
[1:18:02] to surpass the grace of God
[1:18:09] many people even feel that to be
[1:18:11] baptized
[1:18:13] because I like how can I like God
[1:18:16] I am not I know I have done I am a bad
[1:18:20] person
[1:18:21] is very good some even fear to come to
[1:18:25] church
[1:18:26] because they feel they are sinners
[1:18:29] when we are singing they fear to rejoice
[1:18:38] and the devil likes you when you go to a
[1:18:40] club
[1:18:44] better than anybody else

[1:21:33] because without Grace
[1:21:36] there is no man will ever see God
[1:21:44] the Bible says he charged you yeah
[1:21:50] before the foundation of the world
[1:21:54] now listen some people think Grace is a
[1:21:59] license to continue doing bad things
[1:22:06] that is disgrace
[1:22:10] making the grace of God foreign
