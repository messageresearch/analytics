regards to the Saints at evening light bright Tabernacle evening light briac so this service is also being streamed uh on their Zoom service this evening actually so we I just ask that the Lord will

Lord Saints um who are under the sound of my voice this evening both here at the church on the zoom with the Saints at evening light and Lord whoever will might follow this later even those streaming this service father I ask that you'll come and grace us once again with your presence with your word Lord father Lord let your word come forth and move our hearts that we will at the end of the service say did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke talk to us father we commit this service into your heart and we ask that you will give us your grace to be able to minister to your children in Jesus name I pray amen amen we are going to be reading from The Book of Luke chapter 22 L Luke chap 22 31 amen you love the word amen amen vers 31 uh up to 34 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as we but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and he said I tell thee Peter the coke shall not craw this day before that thou shalt thri deny that thou knowest me look uh I for amen amen you may be seated that is I do not remember the title but there is a subject I ministered here some time back there is a um a subject I ministered here at the church and also uh on zoom zoom um but it was connected to uh Believing on the Lord Believing on the Lord Jesus CHR and I remember I read the scripture in the Book of Luke where the disciples are having um you know being released from the prison by the by the angel of the Lord uh when they when they came out then they were with this man and he asked them what what shall I do to be saved what shall I do to be saved and the jail the disciples answered him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you and your house and you shall be saved so and then out of that I spoke to you on Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus is the word and if you believe the word you receive eternal life but you see today i' would like us to take another Corner because you see many people believe in believing the word many believe on accepting the word agreeing with the word and by the way most of the denominations claim to believe the word even many in our churches of the [Applause] message claim to believe the word but you see last time I spoke on three kinds of Believers so then what kind of believer are you and I spoke on the first group which is the um the nonbeliever the nonbeliever what he does is he will come in he will sit under the preaching of the word you will hear the word but as long as the pastor is preaching things that are are nice for him as long as the pastor is encouraging him telling him you are same child of God you are going to The Rapture you are going to be blessed and you know we all love that and so this nonbeliever will love it and he will remain in the church and he can be sometimes he can tend to be a very good church member but if the pastor there in that church or the preachers in that church if they take the word without having any gloves on the word and they preach it the way it is and it convicts this man it condemns him he sees that he's wrong he will feel bad and a prophet said immediately he will not wait he will leave because the word has judged him and he will disbelieve the word and he will refuse it judge he will say the preacher is judging me and he will walk away and let me surprise you sometimes they walk away and they come back sometimes they walk away and and linger and go back but as long as the word is preached hear me Church the nonbeliever cannot sit under the preaching of the word and remain that's why you should always watch people who leave or who go out in the middle of the preaching especially when is very hot when the word is very hot they walk out usually these people are nonbelievers I am not guessing at it I'm the are you hearing me man beli in him or in her she or he cannot stand the word when it comes like a fire he rejects it and he walks away that's the nonbeliever but then there is another group says that the nonbeliever is not a pain at all because for him he walk he walks away but the real problem is the make believer the make a Believer can stay for a really long time the word will be preached the make believer will stay many times make but you see one thing about the make believer they will never genuinely believe the word they will always linger and stay around wait for an opportunity they will wait for an opportunity for a gap where they can be able to point at at the Believers a place where they can be able to fold the word for example you've seen many of these come to church and they will stay around for even years but they they are the ones who know everybody who has done everything actually our Prophet even said they have long ears they hear everything they are the ones who go into everyone's matters they will never be in matters of the people filled with the Holy Ghost be in matters they will know who has done what in the church these ones they will they will be the ones who tell you so and so it's not a good believer theying men and women and you know listen carefully make Believers are very [Music] dangerous because they can be a stumbling block in the church these ones they will stay but you see the moment they see someone you know oh see now the other one has has committed adultery and I told you this church is not right I told you thech is not standing you see now what the other is the people in this church don't love their words the people in this church have a problem the young people in this church are not saved there is a problem in the church these ones are the ones who always see that the church is falling they will never see anything that God is doing they will never talk about what the holy spirit is doing they will always talk about what is going wrong and the prophet also said the example of a make believer is Judas they always they have their hand on the money they love money makeever love money like they can sell the they can sell the gospel or they can sell Christ in just a moment as long as they're going to benefit financially they can do anything without any conviction and then you wonder are you a genuine believer and the sister they wish he was in the church for a long time you mean a man can just give you money and you forget about the message and you forget about what you believe simply because of money those are the ones who fall in the category of brother Judas they betray the word Judas he betrayed Jesus Christ and you know those are the make Believers and then we talked about the genuine Believers and we saw that the genuine believers they may not have perfectly changed yet but when they come under the word they hear the word they get convicted when the word is preached if they are doing something wrong in their life and they hear the word being preached they are preached in their heart they are easily changed when they hear the word it convicts it touches their heart they respond to the word the word and you see the life of the word always follows their life the real believer you know he doesn't want to hear anything he only wants to hear the word the word the real believer came to church for one reason the word not how others are doing it not to see the life of other people they don't care whether someone is a hypocrite or not they only care about one thing I am here because of the word I believe every part of it when you preach something and their life is condemned break down in the presence of the Holy Spirit and their prayer will be oh God change me you see why because they believers they don't just sit there and they said for someone else they shall always receive it that's why we should always you know cheer the word Believers always cheer the word you cannot sit there like a Catholic you cannot sit there like an Ang or like a Baptist Baptists these days are even better than some Pentecostal they receive the word they Rejoice at the word a real believer Fired Up by the preaching of the word amen amen because all of us have emotion but you see a prophet said that you see for us our emotions are on the things of God for them their emotion they make a Believer will come in church but when they go out put on this you know what do you call it soccer or football that's when you knew this person has always beeno I did not know I thought they were silent people you mean by can jump of course you're a genuine believer I'm just giving an example you mean he can jump what happened but what why is he jumping because of the football team [Applause] you know when he comes to church very quiet very silent brother very calm others are dancing and rejoicing you know happy amen shouting running around this one is quiet he's just looking around what is happening with these people look at this now the mucus is cry that one is a make a Believer but the genuine believer doesn't care who sees them the only thing he Minds about is to be in the inner ve only thing mind about is to be in the amen the presence of the Shak where the presence of God comes down sister it fires you up brother it fires you up amen when I pach something condemns your heart as long as you a Believer you will say Amen in other words yes Lord change me amen do I have some real Believers tonight praise the name of the Lord amen amen and so tonight I want to speak on conversion conversion yes and so we see here that you can believe the word when you are not converted so you see we have we have seen we have many types of Believers but there is one type of believer that will be converted praise the name of the Lord amen and we know there are three stages of Grace if you will the first being justification you know this is when you are a sinner but when you hear the word the word touches you and the word pulls you and so you believe the word and when you believe the word you know you you you you come and you know where the word is being preached and so you respond to the word and I'll tell you what happens under justification you know you remain the way you are you have the only desires you had but when you come under the word you know you come Desiring to be changed you come with the old appetites but you know willing and expecting for God to Mo amen and and so then the next thing begins to take place as you sit under the word the word like I told you daily it begins to wash you cut things from you and this is happening in each of our lives every day being changed every day Christ is molding his character us amen amen and so then after that he fills you with the baptism of the holy spirit so now the first believing you believed amen you believed unto you know believing alone does not give you the holy spirit let me put it this way believing in itself does not mean you have received the Holy Spirit does not be does not also mean you converted that's why many times you can find people in church for very many years but they have never been converted fully never been converted when you are converted there are certain things you cannot do when you you are converted you are totally changed and the life of Jesus is now in you and you living above amen your flesh yourh is still you know but you see you have a life of Jesus in you and the life in you of Jesus Christ is the power amen that helps you to live above the flesh it puts the flesh under subjection amen and then you realize you cannot do the things you used to do why because you are converted you can no longer talk the way you used to talk because you ConEd many Believers start this journey but they do not go all the way some of them even think by believing the message they have received the Holy Spirit listen to me tonight you can believe the message and still fail to go in the Rapture the message is not the ticket to the rapture why have people who believe that tonight the message of the hour is not the ticket to the Rapture you must believe the message of the hour but after believing the message then the life of the message the Holy Ghost should come in your life should come and abide in your soul now that is the thing that Christ will look for that is the oil and every believer needs to be filled with this oil amen we have been given the prescription on how to receive the Holy Spirit by Apostle Peter in the book of Acts 2 verse 38 listen carefully church then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for what for the remission of of of sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now number one a person must repent number two they must be baptized in water in much water in the name of Jesus Christ amen and number three Jesus will wash away their sin sanctify that's the work of God number four filled them with the baptism of the Holy Spirit now how come that many can stay in church and they say I was I I repented I was baptized in water but I don't have the Holy Spirit is that possible that is not possible tell your neighbor that is not possible if you do not have the Holy Spirit having been baptized in much water in the name of Jesus Christ it means there is a problem somewhere and I will tell you where the problem should might have started from first thing that must be done amen by a person who wants to be converted is they must repent of their sins now what is sin sin is unbelief of the word now repentance many people think is confession there is a difference between confession and repentance right confession might be part of repentance but it is not repentance repentance is when when you were going this direction and then you decide to turn around and go another direction are you hearing me church if you have been a thief and you hear the gospel you repent of of stealing so from today going to steal I have decided to follow Jesus repentance is a decision to live the wrong way and follow the right way amen I have been living this kind of life I've been living in adultery fornicator I've been a liar I've been dressing badly I've been believing the wrong Doctrine even goes to what you have been believing I've been believing the wrong Doctrine but from today having heard the word I have decided to leave everything and follow Jesus I have decided to forsake my boyfriends to forsake the world to forsake you know sin and I decided to follow the word with all my my heart amen amen I have decided to cut myself away from you know even social media you know chatting that are wrong that are you see you see repentance is done in your heart you may confess but if you confess something which you have not you know fully done in your heart you just wasting your time so we have many Believers soall believers who have not truly repented of their they are in charge baptized but they never repented and that is why even when they are baptized they can never receive the Holy Spirit it is impossible because you see the bis is a person must repent amen repenting is leaving your wrong way but many people what do they do they leave some things and repent some things and that is why they can never overcome because you see this thing remain in their life devil has a claim on you still brother sister amen the moment you truly repent amen of all your sin and you truly decide say I will let nothing between my soul and the Savior nothing between amen all this worldly worldly you know things all these pleasures of the world the lust of the flesh the pride of life I will let from today I will let nothing the you do that you are going to be a candidate the baptism of the Holy Ghost but before you do that you can be baptized one million times still you won't be converted amen and we have many believers who are unconverted unconverted why are they unconverted you know they are in church many you know even sisters they are dressing properly you know why like I thought she's converted dressing oh my listen dressing properly is only a sign you are Sanctified you have left something you know sanctification bres you away from certain things but it does not amen inoculate you from going back that's why you can overcome for a while and then you are defeated again in the same thing you had overcome that is why is very very difficult for you to overcome only by works that is why we do this message is not a message of works it is a message of Grace that you see we are putting the emphasis on the wrong place and we as preachers we are guilty of that we have put our emphasis on the wrong place we have overemphasized for people to dress properly we have overemphasized for people you know to stop smoking stoping fornicating and you know what the people will stop those things because you know you show them in the word it is wrong to do these things and they believe the word so they will decide to stop on their own see these people are not converted soon after they have stopped one week they stop two weeks they stop and then the third week they go back again in the same why because they were doing their own works works failed and works are failing and works will always fail let me tell you amen let me tell you something even when you receive the perfect baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul amen you will begin doing the works of that Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit abides in you and the works of the Holy Spirit can never fail [Music] it can never fail are perfect work because it is the working of God in you so we should go back to emphasizing on people being filled with the Holy Ghost amen amen you as a Believer you should quit worrying about what you can do and what your [Music] failure qu worrying about your failure and then all all the time you are worried you can't even come to church because you fear God May slap you God may take you to Hell in a moment because you know how bad you are and you know what we have received instead we have received a bunch of Hypocrites in the church Hypocrites in form of Believers each of them is living a dir life but they're claiming to be genuine Believers are you telling me that God can give his word and he fails to accomplish it if he sa he will fill you with the Holy Ghost something is able to do stop trying stop pretending you a failure admit accept it when you accept you cannot rest you cannot rest until God fills you with a power which will help you get truly converted amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen why do we live under privileged and we accept a makeover a makeup instead of accepting a real thing if our work is proper and the preacher work is proper then his and his the preacher work is proper then God is work will be proper what is our work our work is repentence when you hear the word God expects you to truly repent many say they have repented then they say they have repented but in behind the closed doors they have not really repented have you repented from fornication but on your phone you know you have not you're still chatting with those same same people you know it in your heart you have you are you have not repented because when you repent you are tired of sin I'm tired of sin and straying Lord Lord I'm done with this now when the moment the day you reach that place you have repented when he said Lord enough is enough of kill me or change me where are where are believers that that kind of desperation kill me or change me I am tired of this situation I am tired of this life I need a change you are tired of that life you are tired of that of living that way you know that's why repentance usually is followed with tears tears tears praise the Lord amen amen I was a very good lover of of of TV television you know what our Prophet speaks on television and so uh when we got married with my wife we have a little time so you have to be a little faster so I I I got you know this television in my home and so I put it up there and um you know zuku I think it was at that time and so I we started watching you know these kind of series and whatever whatever have you you know and the things started getting a hold of us Slowly by slowly caping us and you know and you know I was preaching even at the time and I did not see anything wrong with that you see and and you know when you repent of something you are not ashamed of testifying about it that's how you know someone truly repented and so shortly we we started failing to go to midweek Services why because there is a sched you know TV program we have to watch our family outs were we always with crying and praying and but now it changed because we would always push it and then we first watch these things and then we pray at one when we are very tired and just and so the power of God left left and we were now defeated and so one of those days um you know I went to Ethiopia for a mission and I was with brother Paul in that room and you know I put on a seron that had preached in Zimbabwe some 2011 and the sermon title was desperation and within that sermon I read a quote of of brother Bram which say that some of you who stay at home and watch who love Susie instead of going to church and and so he says if I find that thing shoot it with my shortgun when I heard those words and I began preaching to these people then in 2011 I was preaching to those people but in 2015 this voice was preaching to me now as I was listening on my computer Brethren I could not sleep that night I could not sleep I received such a conviction such a conviction it began building building up building up cry I cried I just slept on the floor very cold but I didn't mind I remember I was a mess that night and I made up my mind in the in the place of Prayer by the way do you know did you know you make up your mind in prayer God reveals to you things in prayer and it say in prayer that you overcome the things that are overcoming you in prayer you receive Revelations of what you should do next even when your back is against the [Applause] wall and you know you don't know what to do next when you go in prayer you know God comes down prayer is not you speaking to God a conversation you speaking to God God speaking back amen you may think it is a thought watch your thoughts when you're in prayer God speaks to you at that time of prayer amen and so always listen to that he gives you an inspiration and then you come out knowing what you're supposed to do and so at that time God spoke to me directly he said go remove that zuku and sell it off and so I I came out I said now how will I convince my wife because I convinced her to get it how will I unconvince her when I arrived at home my wife was already also having her own experience that is why you should always marry a Believer if you Mar a Believer you have done a very good thing because God will always speak to you and speak to her at the same time hallelujah amen you will always be in agreement even when you're in disagreement prayer will bring you back again together prayer and so I found out that she had also heard from the Lord and you know God has spoken to them to switch off everything and so she did not know what to tell me when I come back she was wondering how will I convince him oh my God is good Brethren amen hallelujah amen Oneness in marriage comes from the Holy Ghost it does not come from trying and fighting and hustling com from God can you say amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen and so when I told her my my my side of the story she just laughed and called her a sister because they were together when God spoke to them and so said isn't it what God told us also they told me their story so while we were singing and rejoicing we removed the zuku and sold it off and ever since then our family has been free from that but you see when I was repenting it was out of my heart with bit tears amen that's how repentance is and then now when you truly repent and then you are baptized in water in the right way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in much water do you know what Breen God is bound to do two things to wash all your sins away and fill you with the baptism of the amen amen praise the Lord amen and many times people who truly repent they receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit right right at that baptism service amen hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord amen Brothers when I'm almost out of time you just raise up your hand and show me I just want to um read for you something here the scrip in the message the supernatural now notice you can't make yourself anything different from what God intended you to be anything else is an impersonation therefore if your conversion is only because you're trying to hide behind something or trying to make yourself a better person you are only playing the part of a hypocrite conversion is not you trying to be a better person there is a power that power is called the holy spirit amen am when you believe it and you desire it after truly repenting God brings that power and when it comes it hits you are you hearing me church that power hits you and when the power of the Holy Ghost hits you from that moment you don't need to be a hypocrite you will live naturally amen until Christ has actually come to your life and changed you amen and brought you into an atmosphere that's the difference of it that's the reason we go through so many different forms and saying they have to do this they have to do this Jesus said he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life not I make believe it is absolutely something that has happened a conversion of the heart that has changed you changed you and brought you into another real amen now you begin to see someone walking but they're walking in another real their mind is different their thoughts are different their appetites are different they used to CRA alcohol now the smell of alcohol makes them vomit amen when they see you know these things that were attracting them before it would pull them as if they had a rope in there but now when the Holy Spirit comes you know they walk away from him the power to walk away from your Temptations amen comes from the Holy Spirit it doesn't come from you trying it comes from God you are in another room you in another world you are walking in Heavenly places amen men are misunderstood no no no no when you when you walk in that realm you are misunderstood Christians women men boys they misunderstood who lived in those places because it is contrary to the Natural run of life among the people in the world and I am sure we all want to live in that atmosphere how many want to live in that atmosph now before you've received the Holy Ghost you are believing unto eternal life but you do not have etal life until you receive the Holy Ghost this is from questions and answers now because the holy spirit is eternal life the Holy Ghost is God God is life in you then you've got eternal life do you understand that now see look you are believing unto you believed the message but you're believing unto you believed in baptism in Jesus but you're believing until you are filled with the Holy Ghost praise the name of the Lord amen and any doctor will tell you if you put something on the outside and heal the sound it will only make it worse it has to heal from the inside and that's the way Christianity is it isn't joining church or something it is healing from the inside coming out your conversion comes from the inside the cor Spirit life amen hallelujah amen what was the Holy Ghost given for you believe unto him when you accept him as your personal savior but when God gives but when God gives you the Seal of the Holy Ghost he sealed you to your Eternal destination now you this that and I will go with you on into eternal security yes sir because grieve not the Holy Ghost okay I don't know how to explain it just follow what I'm saying and follow connect to the spirit listen it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption you are not sealed by believing unto but sealed by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost seals you when you found favor with God and he seals you by the holy spirit that is so for the Bible say no man can call Jesus Christ only by the Holy Ghost you say I believe it it because the Pastor said so he's right but that doesn't count for you I believe it because the word says so yes that's right but that isn't for you that doesn't count for you the only way that you can say that Jesus is the Christ is when the Holy Ghost comes into you and bear record and Witnesses itself out is the Son of God Amen that's the only way you know the resurrection is when the Holy Ghost Bears Rec when the Holy Ghost is come he will testify of me he will show you things to come you will bring these things that I say to your memories you will never find it in the school he will bring those things to your memories so Peter had been saved he believed on the Lord he followed him Jesus told him who he was had him to follow him he gave him power against unclean spirits and and he Sanctified him but after all of and become the chief spokesman he became like the pope Catholics call him the pope whatever it was he became the head of the church yet Jesus said the night of his betrayal she asked Peter lovest thou me Peter and he said Lord you know I love you said feed my sheep he said that three times and Peter said you know I love you will go with you to the end and I'll go with you to the death this is a genuine brother but without the Holy Ghost amen he said before the C cow three times you will have denied me three times but have prayed for you that's one thing I wanted to show you tonight if you are a genuine believer of the world Jesus prayed for you in your process before you baptized into the Holy Spirit the devil's desire to have you you like we but they cannot have you amen Peter I prayed for you listen that's not all of it I prayed for you and after you are converted then strengthen your brethren after you are converted he had shouted after you you are converted he had probably danced in the spirit he he had done all these kind of things but he he hadn't received the holy spirit yet after you are converted then the then strengthen your brethren carry out his plan praise the name of the Lord amen and I want to finish with a M with a quote from the questions and answers it's a question that was asked by the prophet is it true that you are not saved unless you have received the Holy Ghost you not saved until you have received the Holy Ghost there could take about I could take about an hour discussion on that when you accept Christ as your savior and you are then ready for baptism in water you have not yet been converted you are only believing un conversion means to be changed now now to make this efficient Jesus said to Peter who had also followed him for three and a half years in the in the Book of Matthew the 10th chapter Jesus gave Peter I want you to explain this to the people properly you see he gave he G he gave people power he gave Peter power against unclean spirits to go out to cast them out to the sick to preach the gospel this was before the Holy Ghost so people can do all these things before my good Lord cast out demons heal the sick preach the gospel against Spirits before they are filled with the Holy Ghost that's why he say gifts the gifts and the calling of God I without repentance but I will tell you Brethren the Holy Ghost cannot be received without repentance that is why if you want to see someone who's truly converted amen the things they used to do they will no longer do them again he had power to do this and and you know Jesus Sanctified Peter through the [Applause] truth Peter had already gone through justification had gone through sanctification but Peter was not yet filled say the word was the truth and he was the word and then before Pentecost he said after you were converted after you Peter then strengthen your brethren you are only taking steps to conversion as you believe and are acting now I know many of you my Baptist and Presbyterian friends disagree with these days even some message Believers are falling in that category they don't believe that someone has to receive an experience brother sister you should receive an experience each of us you should receive an experience until then you are not converted you can be a good brother in the church a good church but when even you have some gifts by the way it is possible but when your life is testifying something else you can even preach but when your life has not yet been converted and each of us needs that conversion each of us need the power of the Holy Ghost to come in our souls have an experience with God then we are candidates for the Rapture then we shall overcome the things which are overcoming us amen praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen I think my time for the for the for the zoom is over and allow me a moment to pray for the Saints on Zoom father in the name of Jesus i' would like to thank you Lord for the moment that you have given to us to share with the Saints evening bless each one of them Father and Lord if there be anyone Lord has been seeking for that experience that true conversion Grant it to them Lord because you a living God father Lord do anyone under the sound of my voice who desires that in their heart may you grant it to them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you Saints on Zoom now friends I'll tell you this this tonight is a teaching and that's why you should allow me a few minutes I I I conclude with this quote because I want I may not go back to this this way you see let me let me continue here just a few moments it says you see you go back to the scripture Abraham in Romans 4 believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness he believed God was imputed unto him for righteousness Abraham believed God and God imputed it to him for righteousness upon the basis of his faith to believe but to prove to Abraham because see what the argument bam is bringing here people are saying Abraham did not do anything Abraham only believed God right but you see the prophet continues and says after Abraham believed God God gave go went ahead and gave him a sign he gave him a sign and that's the sign of the Holy Ghost the Seal of God and there is where you are my dear Presbyterian and Baptist friends you failed to see it he gave him the Seal of circumcision as a witness as a proof that he had received his faith in him and that's why Paul in Acts 19 he said to those Baptist Brethren who had app as their Pastor believe in the Gospel of John he had preached it you ask them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you see they had believed but had not yet been converted now we take the wrong uh word conversion today we say that a man that's converted is a man that stopped drinking this is a good corner here now we are taking we think it's a man who has stopped drinking and everything and goes to the church joins the church he might join the church but that's no sign he's converted he isn't converted until listen the old life is dead are you hearing me Church your old life I don't always look at you like this but allow me to do it today because if this doesn't happen then all preaching is for nothing your old life has to die if you had hatred that has to die if you are an immortal person there is no other way try to P yourself know how you are to die if he doesn't die you are not yet converted you are not filled with the Holy Ghost you are still you have not overcome you cannot you cannot make it to the Rapture you cannot I'll be deceiving you if I tell you you will that old life has to die how can you claim you are a Rapture you know candidate when you are still living in fornication you cannot you are still telling lies goodness lies you are living in your old life you not yet been converted you see you still have FS of anger you you you you still Abus The Works of the flesh are still living in you and you are not yet converted you you you you still have conciousness you know when someone you you always you want that don't belong to you you are not yet converted I am not condemning you I am showing you your condition when you see it you say oh God I need a conversion you know and now let me tell you to repentance will give you the Holy Ghost [Applause] amen before you repent don't even try to ask for the Holy Ghost because you will never receive him he comes in a cleaned up house he comes in a ready Vel he comes in a soul that is hungering and thirsting the Bible says blessed are they after righteousness for they shall be filled he's not talking about mere fasting no he's talking about a soul that is repented and hungering for God amen praise the name of the Lord amen you see he isn't converted until the old life is dead and he is buried in Christ and he is risen with him in the resurrection of newness of life when the Holy Spirit has created in him a Living Hope of eternal life that only comes through the Holy Ghost therefore the question is that a man is saved I believe if he is trying to look towards to calary and dies in that EST because people who debate how about those who like the thief on the cross he did not have that experience but you see he died looking towards Calvary he died in that estate says in that case that man is saved certainly I believe he will be sa he would go through if he had not the opportunity before you go back to the dying Thief at the cross but remember that that was his first and last chance you got one tonight don't wait till that time because it might not be that way with you that girl you playing around with that boy you may not have a chance like the thief on you might not have a deathbed confession you see I tell you that we have very many living like that believer I tell you they all right but you see there there are too much of a chance to take a chance on don't take a chance don't you wait for death [Applause] bed you let this let this be tonight right now your death [Applause] B that you die out now and be born again of the Holy Spirit listen it does not take a full week the longest it took in the Bible was seven days number okay the longest time it has ever taken for people to be filled with the Holy Ghost was seven days and they were waiting in the upper room that's the longest time how about you saying I've been waiting for years God has been waiting on you he's more willing to fill you but you are not repented you are not ready you you are still living in hypocrisy I believe after hearing these words every one of you if you truly believe you ought to leave this do today after saying I've been filled with the Holy Ghost why because it's saying right now now you can be born again now of the Holy Spirit can you receive the Holy Spirit like that yes it is very easy to receive the Holy Spirit if you repent of all your hypocrisy and you clean up your heart with if you don't if you don't receive the Holy Spirit check that area of your repentance are you right with God are you right with with God if you truly are there's no reason why he cannot amen amen now that's where the preacher does his job and he finishes the rest is yours amen because I cannot ask the Holy Spirit on your behalf that's why some Believers when that Revelation strikes you even shut off everything and let me go and seek the holy not because he can't give it to you where you are because you want to have a time of consecration a time where you will put yourself right and you that I am right every area is that's why Believers go in fasting and prayer praying for God to fill them with the Holy Ghost but you see you can receive the prayer the holy ghost in a prayer line you can receive the Holy Ghost when the preacher is still preaching you can receive the Holy Ghost you know we've seen all these things happen when you prayed for during your water baptism I mean God will fulfill his as long as your part is done right let us stand on our feet praise the Lord amen there's a brother Francis Oki um uh he has his children here they he needs prayers he's he's lost his job brother for some years I think for a year now and he needs the Lord to give him another job let us hum ourselves and pray for you father we want to come before you tonight holding this need in prayer Jehovah Gyra the provider of all our needs now Lord we pray for this Brother Francis oh Lord Jesus may you provide a new job for him Lord I know that all things are possible to those who believe may you Lord do perform a miracle for him and let your name be glorified magnify yourself in his life in his family and let it be known that you are the one who has created a job for him in the precious name of Jesus Christ Lord even tonight like to pray for those who are hungering and thirsting that you might feel them that you might Lord help them to overcome different things they going through in their life Lord I know that the things that I've spoken about today are not myths these are not just stories this is a reality Lord you've done it over and over again Lord I've witnessed many people filled with the Holy Spirit children adults men women some during water baptism just like we saw this last Sunday some Lord they have received that Spirit Lord in in a church service others in place of prayer where they went to consecrate themselves but for sure after that a person will know when and how because it is something that they desired you us the holy spirit is God is yourself coming down in our lives living in us to perform your Works Lord someone will be tired and say I'm tired of this life I need a change I need a conversion oh Lord Jesus may you grant it father even now to anyone who might be wary of sin tired Lord of that kind of and even now as they repent with bitter tears saying Lord have mercy on me you see my life has not pleased you not lived right I've lived a life of hypocrisy but now I'm coming home Lord I now repent with bitter tears I now I'm coming home Lord can you do it yes Lord you have done it many many times and I know you can do it again everyone has been under the sound of my voice today Lord everywhere they are Lord wherever they are you can meet them let them have an experience an experience Lord is what we all need maybe we need aing lording Lord grant it father Lord we want to reach that Resurrection morning when we are ready when there's nothing here to hinder us granted Lord we want to I want to commit people into your hands have your way in their lives each and every one of them Lord for all things are possible Lord as we shall also be dismissing
