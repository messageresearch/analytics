[music] As I told you yesterday uh some few years ago when I was in uh Benoni, South Africa, you know, we had some little fellowship with uh pastor Maher and we were speaking about you know our generation. He's my senior by about three years and so we are the same age group. And we're speaking about our generation and the message [music] and how uh you know there's a a changing of of the baton and and you know I told you my thoughts he told he told me his thoughts and I felt this is a man that had a real burden for our generation. So I told him right then that I'm going to invite you for our youth camp. We thought I I thought it would be the second youth camp. It didn't work out. But this one the Lord just placed on my heart and and uh I felt this was the right time and and I believe it was no mistake and I would like us to just be expectant as we have been. The Lord has already been moving. This is a man with one of um uh the fastest growing churches down in the south. I know many already know been following. I was just talking to one of the young people in the church. He said he has been following his ministry and but there are also those who do not know him for you to know the calib of money. He is someone with a backbone to say what the tape says and to to preach what brother Bham preached. I thought what kind of person should we invite? We really want just the message to be preached. I hope you are under expectation. We're not really limiting the time. This is our last service. We have an expectation for our time, but you know, we put no limits. &gt;&gt; And so I'm personally under expectation. So, uh, Pastor Maher from Benoni, South Africa, &gt;&gt; please come and take over. God bless you. [applause] [applause] God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate God. &gt;&gt; You're happy to be here. [applause] &gt;&gt; Uh do you know the song? Amen. [applause] Let's let's try that one. &gt;&gt; The Kenyans are not happy. I didn't sing it in Kenya. I didn't sing this sign. Um someone told [music] me please I beg pastor ask pastor Maha to sing that song. I was supposed listen I was supposed to ask you but I forgot. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; So this must be the spirit. &gt;&gt; So if if he had sang a song inviting me I was not going to sing. &gt;&gt; But now I have to sing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amber. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Okay.

[singing] [groaning and screaming] Amen. Amen. Please give our interpreter volume so that we are on the same level. I greet you once more in the name of our Lord and Savior. I'm very happy to be here. I sing when I'm happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We appreciate God for the servants of the Lord that has preached before me. &gt;&gt; We appreciate Pastor Mike. &gt;&gt; We appreciate brother Joshua. They did a a good job &gt;&gt; and uh I was so delighted. I told Pastor Mike that I'm not happy with him. Yesterday he preached I was very happy. I was blessed because he's my countryman. Deep down I was bleeding. And this this morning he repeated the same thing. and and the way he was smiling when he looks at me is like he knew exactly what he was doing. But uh nonetheless, it's a gift of God. And when you see something being done and being done properly, it does something to you. And brother Joshua didn't preach like a white man at all. I realized there's a black man in him. He was all over the shore. He was a real blessing. We look forward to a time where both of them will come to South Africa. South Africa and be a blessing to us. I know I was I was sort of speeding yesterday. I'll try and be slow. something happens along the way and if it happens forgive me I I wish to just take it step by step. Uh you know I had to rearrange certain things and rearrange and re IS ELOHIM. HE SAYS BUT THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH. SO WHEN JOHN LOOKS BACK, HE SEES ONLY UP TO THE FIRST CREATION OF GOD. THE FIRST THING EVER TO BE CREATED WAS THE LIGHT, NOT THE SU. But the light, the [screaming] logos, THE PILLAR OF FIRE, THE EXPRESSION OF THE INVISIBLE FATHER. BUT WE HAD A GREATER THAN MOSES IN THIS DAY. WE HAD A GREATER THAN JOHN THE REVELATOR IN THIS DAY. HE WENT BEYOND THE BEGINNING AND HE WENT BEYOND THE CREATION OF THE PILLAR OF FIRE. HE SAYS LET US GO BEYOND THAT. LET US LOOK AT GOD BEFORE HE WAS GOD WHILE HE [screaming] WAS STILL ELLA ELOHIM. WHEN HE FILLED ALL TIME, MATTER AND SPACE, HE WAS THE SELFEXISTING ONE. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANAM [screaming] DID NOT ONLY DESCEND THE MINDS OF MEN. WHAT MAKES HIM THE GREATEST PROPHET IS HE WENT BEYOND MAN. HE DESCEND THE MIND [screaming] OF GOD. HE SAYS I CAN SEE GOD IN HIS IMAGINARY MAKEUP. HE BEGIN TO THINK AND SAY WHAT IS HE LOOKING AT? THESE ARE NOT YET WORDS BECAUSE THE PILLOW FIRE IS NOT CREATED YET. HE'S SEEING THAT THOUGHTS OF GOD. HE SAYS HE BEGIN TO THINK AND SAY LET THERE BE LIGHT. IT'S NOT THE LIGHT OF GENESIS 1. HE'S THE LIGHT OF GENESIS ZERO. HE SAYS, "AND I SEE A LIGHT [screaming] PROCEED OUT OF HIM." HE SAYS, "IT IS CALLED BY THE THE BY THE THEOLOGIANS OF TODAY THE LOGOS." HE SAYS, "I CAN SEE HIM DANCING BEFORE THE FATHER'S DOOR LIKE A [screaming] SON." THAT IS THE FIRST THING EVER TO BE CREATED. IS THE SON OF GOD, THE EXPRESSION OF THE FATHER. BUT AT THIS LEVEL IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE NATURAL EYE. THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO TAKE A TRIP. YES. BEFORE MATERIAL EXISTENCE IS ONLY VISIBLE TO A PROPHETIC CLASS with prophetic INSIGHT AND THE ABILITY TO OBSERVE AND DECODE THE SUPERNATURAL. IT IS THE PILLAR OF FIRE. NOTHING WAS MADE OUTSIDE OF THAT LIGHT. WHAT LIGHT? THE PILLOW FIRE LIGHT. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GENESIS 0. &gt;&gt; AND GOD ALLOWED CLINKERS TO BREAK OFF OF HIM. CLINKERS WERE BREAKING OFF. HE CREATED THE SUN. IT WAS BURNING AND A BURNING AND OUT OF IT CLINKERS WOULD BREAK FORTH AND HE WOULD LOOK AT THEM IN IN ETERNITY AND SEE THEM FALLING. HE WOULD ALLOW IT TO GO TO A CERTAIN DISTANCE. AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME, HE TELLS IT TO STOP. HE SAYS, "YOUR NAME IS MASS." HE ALLOWS ANOTHER ONE TO GO. HE ALLOWS IT TO STOP. HE SAYS, "YOUR NAME IS JUPITER." HE ALLOWS ANOTHER ONE TO GO. HE ALLOWS YOU TO STOP. HE SAYS, "YOUR NAME IS PLUTO." &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S WRITING THE FIRST BIBLE. AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE [screaming] THAT BROKE OFF AND IT WENT VERY FAR. BUT SOMEHOW THE PILLOW OF FIRE INTEREST IN THIS ONE, SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ONE THAT HE LIKES ABOUT IT, BUT IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE SUN. SO IT GOT THAT COLD. IT BECAME A BALL OF ICE. BUT THE LOVE OF THE FATHER IN THAT LITTLE CLINKER FOLLOWS IT TO THAT DIRECTION. WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? PREDESTINATION. THE CLINKER DID NOTHING TO DESERVE TO BE LOVED. BUT THE LOVE IS ALREADY THERE. THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT. THOUGH IT HAS [screaming] WANDERED AWAY FROM THE SU N. THOUGH IT HAS [screaming] WANDERED AWAY FROM THE S, THE SON HAS LOVE FOR IT. HE TAKES A HOLD OF IT &gt;&gt; AND HE STARTS BRINGING IT BACK. HE STARTS BRINGING IT BACK. HE REALIZED IF I PUT IT CLOSE TO PLUTO, IT BECOMES TOO COLD FOR IT. IF I PUT IT TOO CLOSE TO MARS, IT BECOMES TOO HOT. BUT IT MUST BE TOO NEAR BUT YET TOO FAR IN THE RIGHT POSITION DISTANCE TO THE SUN. WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT ONE? IT'S CALLED YOU AND ME. WE WANDERED AWAY FROM GOD. [screaming] WE WERE GOING TO GET TO PLUTO. BUT GOD SAID NO. HE PREDESTINATED YOU AND HE STARTED BRINGING YOU BACK, BACK TO THE WORD, BACK TO THE HEAT, BACK TO THE MESSAGE. AND WHAT HAPPENED? THE [screaming] ICE THAT HAD GATHERED AROUND THE EARTH BEGAN TO MELT FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO &gt;&gt; DOWN [screaming] TO AANAS DOWN NEAR TO THE BOTTOM OF SOUTH AFRICA. IT STARTED TO SEPARATE TO ALLOW [screaming] THE EARTH THAT WAS HIDDEN BY THE WATER TO BE IN THERE. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "NOW WE ARRIVE AT GENESIS 1. IN THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT FORM AND DARKNESS WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP. BUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS WERING [screaming] UPON THE WATERS. OH, GLORY TO GOD. THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS OFFERING [screaming] &gt;&gt; UPON THE WORD UPON THE WATERS. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT SPIRIT? &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE LOCOS. &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WAS IT JESUS? YES. JOHN SAYS IT THE PILLAR OF [screaming] FIRE MADE FLESH AND DWELT AMONGST US. THAT'S WHY ONE DAY WHEN THE DISCIPLES CROSSED OVER JESUS SAID I'M FOLLOWING BUT THE SPIRIT BROTHER SAYS IF THE SPIRIT &gt;&gt; OF BEETHOVEN &gt;&gt; IS IN YOU WILL DO WHAT BEETHOVEN DID. THE SPIRITS OF SHAKESPEARE IS IN YOUR YOU WRITE PLAYS AND YOU WRITE BOOKS AND IN THE PILLOW OF FIRE [screaming] JESUS CHRIST IS SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT HE DID IN GENESIS ONE. WHAT DID HE DO? THE SPIRIT [screaming] HOVERED UPON THE WATERS. JESUS DID NOT NEED A BOAT. THE SPIRIT IN JESUS COULD NOT SINK IN WATER IN GENESIS EVER SUNK IN WATER. SAY AMEN SOMEBODY. AND IF THE SAME [screaming] SPIRIT THAT RAISED UP CHRIST FROM THE DEAD IN YOU, [screaming] THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF THIS YEAR THAT SHALL DESTROY YOU. WHEN THE DEVIL COMES LIKE A SPIRIT OF GOD, RAISE UP [screaming] A LITTLE. [applause] [cheering] Satan is in trouble. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; If the devil doesn't know what TO DO WITH YOU, HE WILL touch the things THAT SURROUND YOU. YOU touch the pierces, YOU TOUCH THIS, YOU TOUCH, BUT ME HE CAN TOUCH. FOR THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CAME ROUND ABOUT THEM THAT FEAR HIS AMEN. &gt;&gt; Tonight I feel like preaching. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Pastor said, "Don't bring your tired self." [laughter] That was a zodiac. The first Bible names were written in there. I'm not preaching on that, but one day I'll preach about it. AND OUT OF THE ZODIAC WAS A TRANSLATION. &gt;&gt; THE PYRAMID &gt;&gt; IS A TRANSLATION OF THE ZODIAC. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Isaiah 19:19 Isaiah has got 66 books like the 66 books of the Bible. It starts with the story of Genesis and it ends with revelation in the millennium. [clears throat] 1919 it says it says IN THAT DAY SHALL THERE BE AN ALTAR &gt;&gt; TO the Lord in THE MIDST OF THE LAND OF EGYPT PILL AT THE BORDER THEREOF TO THE LORD. You seeing that EGYPT &gt;&gt; WAS THE CENTER OF THE EARTH. AND GOD SAYS, "THERE SHALL BE AN ALTAR OF THE LORD IN THE MIDST OF THE LAND OF EGYPT. AND THIS ALTAR SHALL BE A PILLAR AT THE BORDER THEREOF OF THE LORD." And he says 20, "AND IT SHALL [snorts] BE A SIGN AND FOR A WITNESS UNTO THE LORD OF HOSTS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT. FOR THEY SHALL CRY UNTO THE LORD BECAUSE OF THE OPPRESSORS, AND HE SHALL SEND THEM A SAVIOR, AND A GREAT ONE, AND HE SHALL DELIVER THEM. THIS ALTAR &gt;&gt; AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH &gt;&gt; IS A PILLAR IS A WITNESS IS A SIGN THAT IS SPEAKING OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS THING IS THE PYRAMID OF ENOCH IS THE PYRAMID OF KOPSY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE STUDIED ARCHITECTURE THEY CALL IT THE PYRAMID OF KOPS. WHICH IS TRANSLATION TO THE PYRAMID OF ENOCH. THIS PYRAMID IS A TRANSLATION OF THE ZODIAC IS A SUMMARY OF THE GOSPEL IN THE HEAVENS. A PYRAMID IN EGYPT &gt;&gt; naturally is is is a tombstone. &gt;&gt; It's a it's A IT'S A BURIAL PLACE. BUT THIS ONE IS NOT LIKE THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT, &gt;&gt; YOU FIND THE SARCOPHAGUS, THE THE THE SARCOPHAGUS WHERE THEY BURY THE KINGS, they are treasures. BUT THIS ONE, IT HAS TWO CHAMBERS WHERE PEOPLE COULD BE BURIED. IT HAS GOT A CHAMBER WHICH THEY CALL THE BRIDE'S CHAMBER OR THE QUEEN'S CHAMBER. AND you ascend IN THE GRAND GALLERY AND THE GRAND GALLERY HAS GOT SEVEN STEPS. NOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO COUNT THE STEPS AS THE TREADS THAT WE USED TO CLIMB UP HERE, YOU'RE GOING TO CONFUSE YOURSELF BECAUSE THOSE ARE NOT THE STEPS THAT WE COUNT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PYRAMID. THE SEVEN STEPS IS THE ROCKS THAT HAVE BEEN PILED ONE AFTER THE OTHER WHICH THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY UP TILL TODAY 10 January 2026 THAT CAN EXPLAIN HOW THAT TYPE OF A ROCK COULD BE CARRIED THAT HEIGHT STACKED TOGETHER IN THAT PRECISION on site. BUT ON SIDES ON ON THAT PLACE WHERE WE ARE MOVING. NOW THERE IS NO TYPE OF STONE LIKE [screaming] THAT WITHIN A RADIUS THAT IS REACHABLE BY A VEHICLE. YOU HAVE TO CROSS THE SEA. TO GET THAT TYPE OF GEOLOGY THAT SHOWS WHATEVER [screaming] TECHNOLOGY WAS USED WAS BEYOND THE TECHNOLOGIES OF TODAY. Seven steps takes US INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER. BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER, THERE IS WHAT WE CALL THE GODS. THESE ARE THREE HUGE BOULDERS THAT PROTECT THE KING'S CHAMBER. BUT THE THE CONSTRUCTION WAS DONE IN SUCH A WAY ARCHAEOLOGIST HAD TO BREAK IT TO WANT TO ACCESS THE KING'S CHAMBER. EVEN AFTER YOU BREAK IT, YOU CAN'T ENTER INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER WHILE YOU ARE STANDING UPRIGHT. YOU HAVE TO BOW YOURSELF DOWN BECAUSE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER. AND WHEN YOU ARE IN THE KING'S CHAMBER, THERE IS A LITTLE PORTION THAT IS BUILT WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN A A A COFFIN OF SOMEBODY, BUT INSIDE THAT THERE'S NO COFFIN. THE MEASUREMENTS OF THIS LITTLE THING IS THE EXACT MEASUREMENTS TO THE ARK OF THE COVENANT. AND THERE WAS A BROTHER &gt;&gt; CALLED BROTHER GREEN. BROTHER GREEN IS THE ONE WHO SANG DOWN FROM HIS GLORY. WHEN BROTHER BRHAM WAS COMING TO PREACH THE UNVEILING OF GOD, BROTHER BRHAM TOLD BROTHER ANGRY, YOU HAVE SANG WHAT I'M ABOUT TO COME TO PREACH ABOUT. BROTHER BRHAM WAS COMING TO PREACH THE SEVENTH SEAL AND BROTHER ANGRIM CAME TO BROTHER BR. THIS IS IN THE BOOK GENERATIONS. IT'S A COMPILATION OF THE TESTIMONIES OF BROTHER. HE SAYS, "BROTHER BRANA, I WENT TO SEE THE PYRAMID OF ENOCH AND THERE IS NO HIEROGLYPHICS. THERE'S NO EGYPTIAN WRITINGS. ALL OTHER PYRAMIDS HAVE GOT EGYPTIAN WRITINGS IN THEM TO SHOW THEY WERE BUILDED BY EGYPTIANS. BUT THIS PARTICULAR PYRAMID HAS no hyographics. BUT AS WE WENT TO THE SEVENTH STEP, THE LAST STEP [screaming] THAT USHERS US INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER. THERE WAS A LITTLE WRITING AND I ASKED THE TOUR [screaming] GUIDE. I SAID, "WHAT IS THIS?" AND HE SAID THIS IS APRIL 1909 0906 1909 HE SAYS THERE'S NO WRITING IN THE ENTIRE PYRAMID. BUT BROTHER, BROTHER, YOUR BIRTHDAY IS [screaming] RECORDED IN THE PYRAMID OF WE GET INTO ETERNITY, WHICH IS THE KING'S CHAMBER. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT I COULD HAVE BROKEN DOWN, but it would have been nice if I put it on a table. [laughter] I started this when I was studying. You would have enjoyed it, but it would have been a lecture. Today, I'm not a lecture. I'm to preach. So, let's pause. How many are with me so far? SO, THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING INSIDE OF THIS PYRAMID. &gt;&gt; THE MATERIAL THAT ARE [screaming] USED IN THE MAKING OF THE PYRAMID. THEY ARE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL. SOME OF THEM THOSE THAT STUDY TECHNOLOGY THEY SAY TESLA'S LAW &gt;&gt; WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE TRANSFER OF ELECTRICITY WITHOUT CABLES WIRELESS TRANSFER OF ELECTRICITY. &gt;&gt; THE PRINCIPLES [screaming] DRAWS THEM FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PYRAMID. IT CAN'T BE A LIE [screaming] BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IN THE MESSAGE OF THE STATION OF A PERFECT MAN THE STATION OF A PERFECT MAN LIKE A PYRAMID AND HE SAYS YOU MUST BE BUILT TO BE A STATION OF THE PERFECT WORDS YOURSELF SITTING YOU [screaming] ARE PART OF THE PYRAMID. AND HE SAYS, "I'M NOT HERE TO BUILD A CHURCH, NOR TO BUILD AN ORGANIZATION, BUT I'M [screaming] HERE TO BUILD THE INDIVIDUALS SO THAT THEY CAN BE A POWERHOUSE, A [screaming] DWELLING PLACE OF HIS SPIRIT TO SHOW THAT A PYRAMID IS A DISTRIBUTION POWER [screaming] OF POWER. PYRAMID. YOU ARE A SOURCE OF POWER. [screaming] YOU ARE A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY. THAT'S WHY BROTHER CAME AND PREACHED THE MESSAGE. THERE'S A MAN HERE WHO CAN TURN ON. [screaming] WHERE IS THE LIGHT? THE LIGHT IS SITTING HERE. BROTHER, BROTHER, WHEN HE HAD PREACHED THE CHURCH HES THROUGH THE SEVEN CHURCHES AND HE PUT LOUDIA IN GROSS DARKNESS AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE CAME DOWN IN. IT WENT TO THE BACK OF THE TABERNACLE AND STARTED THROWING SUDDENLY WHAT BROTHER HAD DRAWN. EXACTLY. [screaming] BUT ON THE SEVEN CHURCHES, BROTHER PUT TOTAL DARKNESS. THE PILL OF FIRE CORRECTED THAT. HE PUT A LITTLE LIGHT THERE. [screaming] THERE SHALL BE LIGHT. WHEN BROTHER [screaming] COMES, HE SAYS THERE'S A MAN HERE WHO CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT. LIGHTS. YOU AND ME, BROTHER SAYS, &gt;&gt; "THE EVENING LIGHTS ARE HERE IN [screaming] UGANDA, UGANDA, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ONCE CALLED DARKNESS. BUT AFTER THE PREACHING OF THE MESSAGE, WE HAVE MOVED FROM DARKNESS AND WE HAVE BECOME [screaming] TO SAVE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. THE WORLD WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT. THEY SEE YOU. Let's put our hands together for &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; must catch these things. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT A STORY ABOUT YOU. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU, BROTHER. [screaming] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU, SISTER. THAT'S WHY EVEN WHEN WE SING THESE SONGS, WE PUT OUR NAMES IN THERE, WE ARE NOT WORSHIPING MEN. COME ON NOW. WHEN HE SAID, "LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE." HE WAS TALKING TO ME. I CONTRIBUTED IN THE CREATION OF MYSELF. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? YOU WERE THERE [screaming] UNTIL ONE DAY WAS A MAN BY THE NAME OF JOB. YOU WENT INTO AMNESIA WHO YOU ARE UP YOUR [screaming] ANSWER ME LIKE A MAN. WHERE WERE YOU? WHERE WERE YOU? THE MORNING STARS. THE SONS [screaming] OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY 26. [screaming] I HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTION. I WAS THERE WHEN I WAS CREATED. I WAS THERE WHEN THE DEVIL WAS CREATED. [screaming] I WAS THERE WHEN HE WAS KICKED OUT OF HERE. Can you say amen? TO RESPOND TO THE MESSAGE OF [screaming] IT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; [screaming] [cheering] &gt;&gt; CHURCH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. SAY AMEN. It's natural to you. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; HEY, [screaming] [cheering] I THINK GOD HIMSELF KEPT THE PYRAMID OF KOPSY AND IN THE BOOK OF ISAIAH. IT SAYS IT'S A PILLAR, WHICH MEANS IT'S A MEMORIAL. A PILLAR IS SOMETHING THAT STANDS OVER A LONG TIME. [screaming] IT SAYS IT'S AN ALTAR. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A [screaming] PLACE OF SACRIFICE. IT SAYS IT'S A WITNESS. IN OTHER WORDS, IT TELLS A STORY. WHAT STORY DOES IT TELL? TELLS A STORY THAT ONE DAY, [screaming] EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE PYRAMID, THERE ARE WATER LINES and marks. THE BIBLE SAYS, "PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE." YOU HAVE A STORY TO TELL. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; THEY CANNOT BE GLORY [screaming] without a story. They cannot BE REIGNING WITHOUT CHARACTER. [screaming] KNOW YOU NOT KNOW YOU NOT. YOU ARE A [screaming] TEMPLE. YOU ARE A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND ONE DAY, SATAN EVEN TRIES IT. TO [screaming] DESTROY YOUR BODY. HE COMES AGAIN AND COVERS THAT PART. HE SAYS, "IF THIS EARTHLY BE [screaming] WAITING ALREADY IN THE HEAVENS AMEN. TELLING them this means that this means that. &gt;&gt; So these are the truths &gt;&gt; that has been lost throughout the ages. So he's telling them the fruit in the garden of Eden. A GOD is not a cheap subject. It's not A CHEAP SUBJECT. IT SOUNDS SO CHEAP TO SAY IT'S ONE GOD WHO OPERATES IN THREE OFFICE. BUT IT'S not as simple as that. AS TO US A SON IS GIVEN AND THE GOVERNMENT SHALL [screaming] AS IN THE FUTURE WHEN HIS BODY IS A SON WHEN HE'S BORN AS A BUT IN THE FUTURE, THE GOVERNMENT SHALL BE UPON HIS SHOULDER. THE SHOULDER IS THE BODY PART WHICH IS THE BRIDE, THE CHURCH BECAUSE HIS BODY IS THE CHURCH. CHURCH IS THE MYSTICAL BODY OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. And his NAME WHEN HIS BODY IS NOT CALLED LATER SHALL BE CALLED WONDERFUL MIGHTY GOD. HE IS NOT BORN GOD BUT HE SHALL BE CALLED. WHY? [screaming] BECAUSE MALACHI SAID, "SUDDENLY, SUDDENLY SHALL [screaming] THE LORD ENTER INTO HIS TEMPLE." THE TEMPLE THAT [screaming] MALACHI IS TALKING ABOUT IS NOT THE TEMPLE OF ZERUBBABEL. THE TEMPLE IS TALKING ABOUT IS THE ONE THAT JESUS SAYS, "DESTROY THIS TEMPLE IN THREE DAYS. I WILL RAISE IT UP." THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN HE COMES TO JOHN [screaming] AS A LAMP BECAUSE THE EGG CELL AND THE SPERM CELL [screaming] WAS BOTH CREATED BY GOD. BUT JOHN S WHEN YOU SEE THE HOLY GHOST DESCEND LIKE A D UPON HIM AND FEEL HIM THEN YOU SHALL KNOW IN OTHER WORDS EVEN JOHN DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THAT DAY AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND JOHN SAYS THERE GO [screaming] TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD DOING WHAT WAS JOHN DOING PREACH TEACHING COLOSSIANS 2 WHICH SAYS AND THE FULLNESS OF THE GOD [screaming] DWELT IN HIM BODILY. YOU ONLY HEAR ABOUT ONE STORY WHEN HE'S AT THE AGE OF 12 DEBATING WITH LAWYERS, &gt;&gt; DEBATING WITH LAWYERS OF THE WORD, &gt;&gt; THE DOCTORS OF THEOLOGY. AND FOR THE NEXT 18 YEARS, YOU HEAR NOTHING ABOUT HIM. THE [screaming] FULLNESS OF GOD, FELT IN HIM, YOU START HEARING ABOUT HIM. GOD COULD NOT DIE. GOD CANNOT DIE. YES. SAY BROTHER SAYS JESUS DIED [screaming] MORE A DEATH IN he did at the cross. WHY [screaming] A DEATH IN? BECAUSE IT WAS IN GETHSEMANE WHERE THE FATHER SEPARATED WITH THE SON THE FLESH PART COULD GO AND BE CRUCIFIED. DO I HAVE EVIDENCE WHEN HE WAS ON THE CROSS AND HE IS BEING CRUCIFIED? THE BIBLE SAYS HE CRIED OUT WITH A [screaming] LOUD VOICE. SAID WHICH IN TRANSLATION MEANS FATHER MY FATHER WHY [screaming] HAS THOU FORSAKEN HIM WHEN HAD THE FATHER FORSAKEN HIM SO HE CAN DIE [screaming] A SINNER CARRIED THE SIN OF THE WORLD [screaming] IS NOT A SINNER YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND WHEN THE BODY DIED, [screaming] THE SPIRIT WENT DOWN [screaming] IN PRISON. THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT I'M PREACHING ABOUT [screaming] ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, IT IS THE SPIRIT THAT IS PREACHING TO YOU TODAY. THAT'S WHY BROTHER SAYS IF HE COMES TODAY IN THE BODY OF MEN AT 33 I WILL REJECT HIM. IT'S A DIRECT QUOTATION. HE SAYS IF JESUS COMES BACK TODAY IN THE BODY OF HORSEMEN AT 33 I WILL REJECT HIM BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE PROMISE OF HIS COMING OF JESUS COMING WEARING A BLUE SUIT, A BLUE SHIRT, A RED TIE WITH AN ORANGE MICROPHONE AND PREACHES TO YOU KNOW I COME [screaming] IN THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK IS WRITTEN GOD AND HE SAYS IT'S ONLY BY THE HOLY GHOST THAT YOU CAN CONFESS THAT JESUS &gt;&gt; IS COME IS COME PRESENT AND CONTINUOUS. YOU MUST RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME [screaming] AND ITS MESSAGE. YOU MUST RECOGNIZE JESUS [screaming] OF TODAY. THAT'S WHY WHEN BROTHER PREACHED, HE DIDN'T PREACH WHO WAS THAT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT [screaming] WORRIED ABOUT THE MECH OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ABOUT WHO IS THIS MEC WHERE ISC PEOPLE ASKING WHERE ISC HE SAYS WELCOME [screaming] TO THE UNVEILING OF WHERE WAS GOD? FAILED BEHIND THEM AND THEY DIDN'T CATCH IT AND THEY DIDN'T CATCH IT AND INVITED THEM AGAIN. HE SAYS THE MIGHTY GOD [screaming] AND FAILED BEFORE US. [screaming] AMEN. THE WORLD &gt;&gt; THE WORLD IS AGAIN CONDITION AND THREE THINGS MUST HAPPEN MUST BE ON EARTH TO WITHSTAND THE PROPHET MOSES THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A LOT OF PREACHERS THAT ARE TRYING TO IMITATE BROTHER THE SPIRIT OF JANICE AND J ONLY ONE AMEN. WHO HAS THE RIGHT [screaming] TO DESEND THE HEARTS OF PEOPLE FROM THE being question? CAN WE SAY AMEN? NO PASTOR [screaming] HAS A RIGHT TO DISCERN YOUR HEART. BROTHER SAYS THERE'S ONLY ONE IN AN AGE. HE HAS ONLY ONE ALSO IN A GENERATION. AND HE SAYS IN THE CHURCH BOOK, THOSE THAT LEAD OTHERS ASTRAY BIND THE PEOPLE TO THEMSELVES BY FEAR AND THEY OPERATE A GIFT WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR. IF YOUR GIFT IS NOT 100%, GO TO THE BACK ROOM OF THE CHURCH [screaming] WHERE WE HAVE TO JUDGE YOUR PROPHECY. YOU CANNOT DESERT THE SHRINE OF CHRIST BECAUSE THAT'S THE MESSIANIC SIDE. [screaming] I FEEL SOMETHING ON ME. I FEEL SOMETHING ON ME. STOP ME. YOU CAN'T STOP ME. WHOEVER CALLED ME, YOU CAN. I'M HERE BY THE MIGHTY ARGUMENTS OF CALVARY. [screaming] ADVOCATING FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU MUST CATCH THE REVELATION OF HIS MERCY. WE ARE TYING THE TALES OF THE FOXES. WE ARE TYING THE TALES OF THE FOXES. WE WANT TO BEND CAMPALA. THE FIELD OF THE PHILISTINES MUST BEND AND YOU NEED AN EQUIPMENT. YOU NEED AN IGNITION OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT IS ALREADY IN YOU WHICH is the message. [screaming] [groaning] Say amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If I touched some nerves, forgive me. spoken with. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, I'm not sorry. &gt;&gt; We are trains to the message. trained man. I can take the message to others to hand it over to go and burn. This is not just a youth meeting. Gather here and get excited but want to TRAIN A PEOPLE NOT WITH a banana backbone. We are not THE SONS OF KISH. WE ARE THE SONS OF JACOB. SAY AMEN. ABRAHAM HAD 318 TRAINED SERVANTS. ABRAHAM 318 TRAINED IN THE HOUSE OF ABRAHAM AND WE ARE SERVANTS TRAINED [screaming] IN THE HOUSE OF BRHAM to handle the SWORD OF THE WIND. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; A mirror in the pyramid pyramid. SO HE FINISHES EXPLAINING THE THE INSCRIPTIONS AROUND THE PYRAMID. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM WAS HANDED A CROWVER. AND HE RIPPED THE TOP PART. AND HE SAYS THERE WAS A WHITE GRANITE ROCK WHERE NO [screaming] SUN HAS EVER SHOWN. YES. AND HE TELLS THE MINISTERS, "LOOK ON THIS." THAT'S THE COMMISSIONER. ON THIS FOR I GO WEST TO CONNECT WITH THE ANGELS AND I WILL COME [screaming] BACK THE INTERPRETATION OF [screaming] THE WHITE ROCK BROTHER BUT YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING US A LOT OF THINGS WE WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN OUR NOTES WE FEEL LIKE WE WANT PREACH [screaming] BUT THE COMMISSION IS DON'T GO LOOK ON LOOKING on the WHITE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING ON THE WHITE [screaming] we have been LOOKING set your EYES ON THE MESSAGE SET YOUR EYES ON THE MESSAGE SET YOUR EYES ON THE MESSAGE LOOK ON THIS LOOK AT PUSH LOOK AT THE PROPHETS OF THE WORLD. LOOK ON THIS. [screaming] UGANDA. UGANDA. UGANDA. UGANDA. UGANDA. UGANDA. UGANDA. LOOK ON THIS. LOOK ON THE MESSAGE. THERE'S A LIGHT [screaming] THAT IS COMING. THE LIGHT COMES. YOU SHALL [screaming] UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S THE SECRET BENEATH THE ROCK? Look on this brother. LOOK ON THIS BROTHER. LOOK ON THIS SISTER. AND THIS BROTHER BRANA WAS GOING UP AND DOWN IN THE VISION. HE SAYS, "I LOOKED AT THE CORNER OF MY EYE. I SAW BROTHERS FROM GEORGIA, MANY OTHER PLACES. THEY WERE EXCITED ABOUT THE INSCRIPTIONS. They said, "We don't know how long brother is going to take. Let's go AND START PREACHING ME. WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH. THEY ESTABLISHED MINISTRIES, BASED ON dos and DON'TS based on Old TESTAMENT UNTIL THE MESSAGE IS DEFINED AS PEOPLE WHO DON'T WATCH television and people who wear long dresses. WE ARE KNOWN MORE FOR WHAT WE DO NOT DO. THAN WHAT WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE BECAUSE IT'S MEN WHO TOOK THE INSCRIPTIONS AROUND BEAPT. BUT THERE'S MORE TO THE MESSAGE. THERE'S A RAPTURE. THERE'S A THERE'S A BODY CHURCH. THERE'S A THIRD. THERE'S A FUTURE HOME. There's a token. [screaming] THERE'S TOO MUCH IN THE AMEN. AMEN. [screaming] I GO WEST. I GO TO CONNECT WITH THE ANGEL. AND THE BIBLE SAYS, "AS THE LIGHTNING SHINETH FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST, [screaming] SO IS THE COMING OF THE LORD." FOR IS THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN. IT SAYS AND THERE [screaming] WHERE THE CARCASS IS WHERE THE THE GATHERING OF THE EAGLES WHERE &gt;&gt; IN THE EAST WEST THE GATHERING OF THE EAGLES. IT'S HAPPENING IN THE WEST. WHEN YOU HEAR WEST IS THE PLACE OF THE SETTING OF THE SUN. And brother Brham when he was young he would meet these people fortune tellers say about him you moment they see you you brother says I was never I would try to every time they SAYS YOU BORN UNDER HIS YOU WERE BORN IN THE CROSSING OF THE STARS. WHEN YOU WERE BORN, THERE WAS A WRITING IN THE ZODIAC that announced your birth. YOU WERE BORN THE SAME TIME THAT Jesus Christ WAS BORN. YOU HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL. NOT FOR INDIANA BUT FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD. BUT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE SUCCESS UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE WEST. NOW BROTHER, &gt;&gt; America is in the west. But it was not west enough for the west because in THE WEST THAT THE SUN sets and being IN THE WEST WHERE THE SUN SETS was not enough. yet to FIND A PLACE THAT IS CALLED SUNSET IN [cheering] [applause] the chickens. We have LOST THE CHICKENS. NOW WE ARE PREACHING TO YOU [screaming] ON SUNSET to be WORTH [screaming] IT NO LONGER THE MINISTRY OF MEN. IT CHANGED FROM THE MINISTRY OF MEN. IT BECAME THE MINISTRY OF ANGELS. SEVEN ANGELS FROM ABOVE [screaming] CAME DOWN. BIG BROTHER INTO A [screaming] CONSTELLATION THEMSELVES. NOW, NOW BROTHER IS INSIDE. 56 MILES HIGH. An aeroplane can't even move in. Here is a man WITHOUT ANY REGALIA to protect him from the weather up there. In other words, brother Brham had to experience a body CHANGE for him to be in the consolation. BUT HE WAS THEN GIVEN A MYSTERY. HE SAYS, "THEY TOOK ME INTO A CONSOLATION OF THEMSELVES, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THINGS THAT ARE ONLY KNOWN TO THEMSELVES." THE THINGS AROUND THE PYRAMID ARE KNOWN TO EVERYBODY. THE THINGS AT SUNSET MOUNTAIN IS A MYSTERY THAT WAS HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE AGES. [screaming] AND WHILE HE WAS IN THERE, HE SAW SOMETHING. [screaming] THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE PYRAMID. THERE WAS EVERY [screaming] SEVEN ANGELS. HE SAYS SIX OF THEM WERE ORDINARY. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. [screaming] BUT THE SEVENTH ONE WHO WAS A SPECIAL ONE, IT DOESN'T MENTION ABOUT THE SIX [screaming] ANGELS HAVING WINGS. AND HE SAYS THE SEVENTH ONE AND SWEPT BACK THE WINGS. WHY [screaming] THEY ARE BRINGING &gt;&gt; THE POWER TO FLY AWAY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THE REVELATION OF THE SEALS IS THE WINGS. THERE'S A BROTHER WAS SAYING ABOUT I DON'T HAVE WINGS BUT I LIKED IT BECAUSE THE WINGS THAT YOU HAVE PHYSICAL WINGS THERE ARE WINGS CAME WITH THE SEVEN ANGELS ARE THOSE WINGS THE BIBLE SAYS THERE'S A WOMAN THAT WAS TRAVAILING THAT'S REVELATION THERE WAS A WOMAN THAT WAS TRAVAILING WAS GIVEN TWO SETS OF WINGS SO SHE COULD FLY AWAY [screaming] TO THE WILDERNESS FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. WHAT IS THAT? [screaming] RAPTURING FAITH TO MAKE YOU ESCAPE THE THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF THE TRIBULATION AWAY [screaming] BE IN THE LORD'S SUPPER. WHAT I AM PREACHING IS RAPTURING [screaming] FAITH BECAUSE THIS DIVINELY REVEALED MYSTERY TRUTH LITERALLY TURN THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN TO PENTECOST [screaming] TO OUR FATHER TO WHO YOU ARE BROTHER WAS IN THERE. HE SAYS, "I SAW THE FIRST ONE, BUT THE SEVENTH ONE WAS MORE NOTABLE UNTO ME. And if I COME TO UGANDA &gt;&gt; AND I'M IN THIS CHURCH AND I SEE ALL OF YOU, WELL, YOU ARE SPECIAL. I APPRECIATE YOU. THERE'S NO PROBLEM. BUT IF I SEE SOMEBODY WITH A blue suit which has stripes, A BLUE SHIRT, A TIE THAT IS RED, A SHIRT WITH CUFFLINGS, SIDE WITH TEETH LIKE THIS, EYES LIKE THIS, NOSE LIKE THIS. EVEN IF I WAS WALKING, I WILL STOP A LITTLE BIT. I WILL SAY WHO IS THIS ONE? BECAUSE THIS ONE IS ME. [screaming] I SEE. I SEE MYSELF. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THERE WAS A PROCLAMATION. WHERE AM I NOW? [screaming] REVELATION CHAPTER 5. WHO IS WORTHY TO TAKE THE BOOK TO LOSE THE SEA OF? OH, THERE WAS [screaming] NO ONE FOUND WORTHY IN HEAVEN. NOT ON EARTH, NOT UNDERNEATH THE HEAD. JOHN [screaming] HAD THE HOLY GHOST. JOHN WAS THERE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. REVELATION 5 AND JOHN WEPT. IT MEANS [screaming] THE HOLY GHOST PENTECOST WAS NOT ENOUGH. [cheering] YES. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; IF THE SEALS ARE NOT REVEALED, EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, THAT'S WHY JOHN WEPT? BECAUSE THE BOOK HAD A MYSTERY, A MYSTERY OF WHO JOHN WAS. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MIRROR IN THE PYRAMID. WE ARE STILL LOOKING. WE EXPECTING TO SEE SOMETHING. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, ONE OF THE ELDERS SAYING, JOHN, [screaming] WEEP NOT. I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. THERE ARE 24 ELDERS. 12 OF THEM ARE PATRIARCHS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AND 12 OF THEM ARE THE APOSTLES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT. SO OF THE 24 ELDERS, ONE [screaming] OF THEM WAS JOHN. SO WHICH ONE OF THE 24 ELDERS SAID UNTO JOHN, &gt;&gt; WEEP NOT JOHN, THE [screaming] LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. WHO SPOKE TO JOHN? [screaming] &gt;&gt; Who spoke to JOHN [screaming] [laughter] to John? JOHN WENT [screaming] TO HEAVEN. JOHN SAW [screaming] WHEN THE BOOK WAS REVEALED. JOHN DID NOT SEE IT IN ACTION. JOHN DIDN'T SEE YOU. JOHN SAW HIMSELF AND HE [screaming] CHANGED FROM WEEPING TO REJOICING. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TRUE WORSHIP DESPITE THE REVELATION WE CAN ONLY SHOUT. [screaming] AMEN. WE CAN ONLY SHOUT WHEN THE SEALS ARE REVEALED. AND WHEN THE SEALS ARE [screaming] REVEALED, WE SEE OURSELVES. THERE WAS A BOY WHO FINISHED HIS FATHER'S LIVING [screaming] IN RIOTERS LIVING AND HE WENT TO A FAR AWAY COUNTRY [screaming] JOINED HIMSELF WITH A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD STARTED EATING WITH THE PIG. BUT ONE DAY [screaming] THE BIBLE SAYS HE CAME TO HIMSELF. I HAVE A QUESTION. WHO CAME TO HIM? WHO CAME TO [screaming] HALLELUJAH [screaming] TO TELL YOU? [cheering] [applause] HALLELUJAH. That's right. HALLELUJAH. HE CAME TO HIMSELF. IT'S NOT YOUR BROTHER. IT'S NOT YOUR [screaming] SISTER WHO'S GOING TO COME TO YOU OF THE HOUR. THE INTRODUCTION OF YOURSELF [screaming] TO YOURSELF. PAUL SAYS [screaming] WE LOOK, HE SAYS, "WHEN I WAS A CHILD, AS A CHILD, BUT NOW THAT I'M SPEAK, I'M NO LONGER [screaming] A CHILD." THE BIBLE A A CHILD A SON [screaming] AS LONG AS HE'S A CHILD DIFFERENT NOTHING FROM A SER [screaming] IS UNDER TWO UNTIL A TIME THERE IS A [screaming] TIME THAT TIME APPOINTED AND WHEN THE TIME COMES HE'S GIVEN AUTHORITY [screaming] AND PAUL SAYS NOW WE IN PART [screaming] IN PART WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT [screaming] IS NOT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR WHEN THE [screaming] MESSAGE IS COME WHICH IS IN PART. [screaming] Look in a CLASS BUT DAY [screaming] WE SHALL SEE FACE TO FACE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? [screaming] YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOURSELF. THE BIBLE SAYS ONCE THE LORD HAS SPOKEN BUT TWICE. HE SAYS ONCE THE LORD HAS SPOKEN BUT TWICE HAVE HEARD HIM. HOW DO YOU HEAR TWICE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN ONCE? IT MEANS YOU HEAR FIRST [screaming] IN YOUR THEOPHONY AND THEN YOU HEAR IN YOUR FLESH. THAT'S WHY BROTHERS WERE OPEN. [screaming] WE HEARD FROM OUR AND I'M HERE TO [screaming] TELL YOU WE ARE HEARING FROM OUROPHONY. It's my theophony. IT'S MYOP [screaming] THE BOY. THE BOY CAME TO HIMSELF. AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF, HE SAYS, [screaming] I WILL ARISE AND GO BACK TO THE FATHER. THE FATHER WAS WAITING FOR HIM. THE FATHER BEFORE THE BOY LEFT, HE HAD TAKEN A picture of THE BOY. EVERY NOW AND THEN THE FATHER WOULD LOOK AT THE PICTURE AND SAY, "MY BOY IS COMING. MY BOY IS COMING. MY BOY IS COMING." AND WHEN THE BOY ARRIVED, THE FATHER LOOKED AT THE OLD PICTURE. HE SAYS, "YOU ARE NO LONGER LOOKING LIKE YOUR OLD PICTURE. SHAVE HIS BEARD BODY. GIVE HIM A NEW ROBE. [screaming] GIVE HIM A RING. HE MUST LOOK LIKE HIS PICTURE. GOD TOOK A PICTURE OF YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH AND HE PRESERVED IT IN GLORY. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND AS YOU ARE COMING, MAYBE YOU ARE SICK. LOOSEN THE PICTURE. HE SAYS, "THIS IS NOT YOUR PICTURE. MAYBE YOU ARE POOR. THAT IS NOT YOUR PICTURE. MAYBE YOU'RE INNIA. THIS IS NOT YOUR PICTURE. I'M HERE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. IF I TAKE A PICTURE WITH MY PHONE RIGHT NOW AND I GIVE YOU MY PHONE AND I ASK YOU, WHO IS THE FIRST PERSON THAT YOU'RE going to look at? &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NOT LOOK AT OTHERS, YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF. AND IF YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED INH [screaming] SO IF MY PICTURE I AM SICK DELETE THAT PICTURE IN MY [screaming] PICTURE I DON'T HAVE MONEY THAT IN MY PICTURE [screaming] I DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST I WANTS MY PICTURE. MY ORIGINAL PICTURE, MY ORIGINAL PICTURE. I AM [screaming] THE PICTURE OF WHO I AM. THERE WAS A BOY WHO WAS IN [screaming] THE RURAL AREA. THERE WAS A BOY IN THE RURAL AREA AND HIS FATHER HAD A LITTLE MIRROR THAT HE WOULD USE TO SHAVE. THE WORDS IS A PICTURE THAT YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE MOUTH AND THE MOUTH PART IS A PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; THE MOUTH IS PENTECOST WHICH IS aerodynamics speaking in times AND INTERPRETATION. IT WAS JUST A LITTLE PENTECOSTAL AND BROTHER SAYS YOU HAD TO CLIMB ON A LITTLE CHAIR FOR YOU FOR HIM to see his mouth. In other words, he need a little seminary EDUCATION JUST TO SEE HIS MOUTH. BUT ONE DAY HE WAS INVITED TO THE CITY. NOW THE RURAL AREA IS A SLOW DIMENSION. BUT THE CITY IS A FASTER DIMENSION. HE WAS MOVED FROM A SLOW DIMENSION TO A FASTER DIMENSION AND HE VISITED HIS AUNTIE BOY IN HIS AUNTIE AND THERE WERE SEVEN STEPS JUST LIKE IT WAS IN THE PYRAMID AND THE BOY WAS PLAYING HE WENT THE FIRST STEP AND WHEN HE GOT TO THE SEVENTH STEP THERE WAS A MIRROR A FULLS SIZE MIRROR SOMEBODY [screaming] SOMEBODY APPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE [screaming] AND HE WAS SHOCKED. I DIDN'T KNOW. MY AUNTIE HAS ANOTHER [screaming] CHILD AND HE WAVED AT THE BOY. THE BOY [screaming] WE BACK AT THE BOY BACK. NOBODY TOLD HIM HE SAID [screaming] MAMA MAMA MAMA THAT IS ME [screaming] SAY MAMA MAMA &gt;&gt; MAMA MAMA MAMA, THAT IS ME.
