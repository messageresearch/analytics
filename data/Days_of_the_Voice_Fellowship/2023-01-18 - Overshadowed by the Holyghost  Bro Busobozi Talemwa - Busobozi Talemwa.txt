Luke and in this and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God and to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said excuse me hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold thus shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be saying I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born in thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cast in Elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with god listen to this for with God nothing shall be impossible foreign [Music] foreign foreign and by denominational people and especially around the birth of Jesus they they read a lot of this video yes about Mary and how of course the Catholics love Mary when you know in Ethiopia when you talk about Mary they feel so good and they feel so excited even when someone was not going to give you their ears when you the moment you speak about Mary now they can give you their ears but one of the reasons why I love the message always teaches in types usually especially in the Old Testament you take those and then he was able to apply them in to fulfill them to show their fulfillment in the ministry of Jesus Christ for example David with Christo you know he's able to type Joseph and say that that was a type of Christ he explains in detail in English there's a lot of detail on those types and so then we also see that uh here in the New Testament we can also see many of these characters there in the New Testament as types of the Bride of the end times [Music] you remember one time I've spoken on the on the thief on the cross how the thief on the cross is a type of the Church of the Bride because [Music] remember that song which we used to sing say oh that dying Thief Rejoice to see that fountain in his day [Music] we can talk about Lazarus we can talk about many characters but tonight I'd like us to take a character also is a type of the True Church of Christ of Jesus Christ Mary is a type who can look at her as a type of the Bride actually as a virgin bride of Christ you remember the story that Jesus Christ gave of the five ways virgins and the five foolish virgins when the trumpet sounded then the wise virgins of course all of them were sleeping so when the trumpet sounded in the middle of the night all the ten virgins arose but you see the five wise virgins [Music] they had extra oil [Music] you see you know all the others had oil this morning I was discussing with my wife and she was asking me why brother I'm called the other some of the denominational people Christians children of God Believers and you know to be a Christian you must have Christ in you right call them Christians yes they are Christians all over yes it's just like I can say there are many message Believers all over the world and now if to go in the Rapture if all that you needed to go in the Rapture was to believe or accept the message then I'm telling you there are many people going in the Rapture you don't even need to struggle I just do everything you do you just believe the message but you see believing the message is only a foundation it is the best upon which you receive the requirement for the Rapture and so we see that this virgins they were all virgins there's only one thing that can make someone a virgin if they have character and you cannot get character without the word bible believers they had the character of the world but they also had the oil which was the spirit says that you see you can receive the Holy Spirit upon your spirit but not filled in your soul um how one day he was so anointed when he had gone to kill David because he had said many of his uh people to go and kill David but you see whenever they would arrive there David was among the prophets so you see whoever went there became anointed to prophesy and yet they were not prophets but they began jumping up and down saying thus say the Lord and the Soul said why are you not fulfilling what I've told you today until finally he said let me go myself I shot this boy when he arrived there where he found himself also jumping up and down prophesying he was anointed through Jane wine spirit of God he was not a prophet you see so someone can be anointed to prophesy when they are not really prophets in the same way someone can be Anointed with the spirit the true spirit of God when they are not filled with the Holy Ghost in their souls preached that someone called the anointed ones at the end of time they are anointed with a true genuine holy ghosts so false anointed ones so you see these virgins yes I can see that someone wants to hear a little more about that we are false because they did not bring forth the right sin cubanga foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] the weed did not become the wheat because it received the rain [Music] [Applause] only the true seed of God will mature into the full stage of Christ by the water um that spirit of God will bring out amen that which was in you before the foundation of the world Amen Amina it will not change he will bring forth what is in you touch you that you could choose that's why I always tell you the devil cannot defeat Us big nature which we are born with our original nature we will not be smelled Lambs they probably busy we were alarmed with a big nature [Music] it showed us who we really are amen and every day we begin dropping that nature which is not using the nature that who is really in us and that's the reason why he overshadows us with the Holy Ghost so we go back to the virgins for the five wise virgins are the foolish virgins they had oil both of them but the oil of the five foolish virgins that the anointing will always run out of foreign these ones we're ready they trimmed the alarm hallelujah hallelujah amen and that is they told The Voice once told the foolish ones I am sorry go to those that serve again let them sell you what we have is only enough you cannot share the Holy Spirit that God who gave that brother has to give you your own portion and when you receive your portions will receive it for free for free it begins by receiving the world confessing everyone and the more you get into the word of God Amen but you you find yourself in amen wrapped up and Tangled Up With Jesus and it begins to change your nature and so these people they had to go and find their own Holy Spirit we have to go and do the crying to go and do their searching but the only problem was time will come one time will run out [Music] going to be very sad for people who are attending church and many of them are going to be message Believers because in the message it's where we really teach the Rapture the others don't know much about the Rapture a few others may take the Rapture but not in details emphasize it because it's not their main objectives teach the tribulation they say that the Saints will go through the tribulation [Music] we are going to go up together when the world will go in the tribulations we shall be there together it's not yours to do we have to receive the Holy Spirit now let us look at Maryam Mary was a virgin Mary and the angel came to her Mary was a woman like all the others she was born in sin she was sheltered iniquity she was sinful and she was a weak vessel you see the Holy Ghost does not overshadow the perfect day amen amen the holy ghosts overshadows the sinful those who accepted in iniquity those who are born in sin and those who are weak um when God came down he told Mary Mary God favors you oh [Music] the Lord is with thee the Lord is with blessed are thou among women blessed are thou among women amen we are highly favored amen the Lord is with us we are blessed among a church why because we are the bride of Christ we have been chosen bring forth the promised son it is very hard only one question shall this be and then the answer was definite even though holy ghosts shall come upon thee um for with God for with God nothing shall be impossible Hallelujah Amina I do not see how possibly this can failure when I look at myself maybe you want to say the same thing foreign [Music] I don't see this happening but when I see you the confidence and the moment Mary say that all the Holy Ghost came down amen she received something in her womb and you know our womb is the soul [Music] the word listen listen when you believe the word the word must bring the Holy Ghost if the word you believe does not bring down the Holy Ghost it is foreign foreign I just started shouting I'm rejoicing Ninja I don't think she said that I was yesterday the Holy Spirit [Music] until one day we will all be filled with the Holy Ghost that we will be able to go in a Rapture tonight until even the devil will not know what to do with us I want to be one man who is so filled with all because that the devil will try to tempt me but he doesn't know what to do with me Hallelujah we will actually be the Thunder to the devil foreign that he never would send you his agents and those agents will touch fire and they themselves would be changed that's the power of the Holy Ghost that's the power of the Holy Ghost we were walking on the streets I told you I've told you this story many times you know money she came to work but she came around to men who were so filled with the power of God you know where she ended up I believe those are the testimons we need to have um we don't want Brothers to come here just forgive me he was out there where was the Holy Ghost where was he because if he overshadows the devil cannot even know what to do with you yes but he will overcome each time and you will be a testimony it's not ourselves that do it they know how of the Holy Ghost that overshadows Us in Romans 9 15 he says to Moses I will have Master on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion and whom I will have compassion um [Music] and then he says so then it is not of him that we will wait to see you you are your Gala nor of him that runeth Amina it's not because of me that I receive the holy ghosts [Music] I was only a little poor Mary leaving my little sinful life and then one day and then one day the angel of God showed us and when he showed up he told me things I've never had before and then what I believe to them when I received it when I believed let your wife be born in the manger of my heart you see this is what we need to treat Our God let me tell you when you come to Christ you should have a desire to birth the Holy Spirit the church is a labor one I told you in a hospital and churches are hospitals touches our hospitals but in the hospitals there are two important places the first one is a very important place without it there is no hospital is the mortuary everything is in order foreign the order of the mortuary be quiet now if I type that with the church you'll also find some denominationals that are actually representing that guanica whatever they read here tells them to be quiet foreign brother you'll even read for you somewhere like those ones in another room let's not disturb the peace I was really enjoying it but then that Other Woman disturb myself for him to be able to preach yes even when you are anointed you can't preacher hallelujah hallelujah the next thing they can do is to does everything they can do is maybe to work out or use their phone that is a dead religion says [Music] if your religion has no emotions so that the power of the Holy Spirit you see those things bring down the Holy Spirit [Music] [Music] you can never hire foreign [Music] that will bring down something and then after that when the Holocaust come there will also be noise [Music] when a baby is born then they say yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah amen and he also has his own noise the noise of the Holy Ghost is the life that it brings in you hallelujah amen and that's the part the blessing where I want to be I want to be in that mess may God help us a place where the dead are kept 84. where there is zero temperature of the spirit so it's not him that runeth by allowing the Holy Spirit to overshadow us we didn't even want we didn't even run to get it we were just running away from him to from the beginning was running away he came seeking for us and they found me and when when we we had the word of life we received his message it says then he answered and spoken to me saying this is the word of the Lord say not by might not by power but by my spirit ual money amen Amina if you believe him you get picked by the Holy Ghost it's not by you trying to do it you just believe the word and the word amen by the bottom says in the message the angel of the Lord the new birth is an experience it's a gift of God it's the Seal of your faith the holy spirit is the name of the Lord amen God made Abraham the promise and Abraham believed God was justified by faith and God give him the sign of circumcision so he does today we believe in him and then if you say you believe and do not receive the Holy Spirit if you so many believe here foreign do you know the longest time it took for people to receive the Holy Spirit [Music] how many in the upper room hey yes that was long because they were tiring waiting for him for the first time for us it doesn't have to be 10 days immediately immediately as a matter of fact I'm challenging you don't leave this service without receiving the words if you believe it you believe the holy spirit amen just lift up your hands I want the Holy Spirit I receive the Holy Spirit if you ask but Sarah you receive he says if you believe you shall receive it's very complicated going to pray for Saturdays and Saturday nights it's not him that Runners all you have to do is to believe hmm and then if you say you believe this is your Prophet now and you don't receive the holy spirit because God promise and now in believing you do not receive the Holy Spirit When You Believe Paul asked in Acts 19 have you received the Holy Spirit since she believed I believe the message I have received the Holy Spirit you see Paul asked them did you receive the Holy Spirit since you believed it's a gift of God and when that when the spirit of God comes into a man it quickens him and then it becomes a new creature he believes in the immortal gods that he does all sings in tune with God like you believe and you believed you saved and his blood was applied upon your life you must also believe in the Holy Spirit is yours when you believe that history and he says and when the spirit of God comes into a man's heart all his intellectuals just fed um and the Darkness and the doubts just go away hallelujah amen and you can't find it any anymore there is and you truly are one of God's attributes that he spoke [Music] now if you're not only you will wonder and frustrate and run here and run there and everything else [Music] you never come to the knowledge of the truth if you're one of those all things pass away right now and you become new the power of Salvation is finished you are ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you oh wait I might take a foreign foreign [Music] Brown and it was at the day of Pentacles has full access to the Holy Spirit Hallelujah but the Bible says as Peter was yet speaking those words unto them baby the Holy Spirit many times I mean when the word of God is going on and you begin to feel different maybe begin to feel like shouting oh you feel just nice [Music] don't cool it down just do it if he says that moment the Holy Spirit because I'm preaching to you as I'm preaching to you that he's speaking to you I'm telling you things God damn baby into if he tells you you're forgiving of what you did it's under the blood what do you do you don't just say it's my thoughts um if he says you're going to walk out of here don't just sit there I think I was just thinking it is to come and tell us that our thoughts in heaven shout louder than our words I don't know about you but many times before I even prayed for something I just thought about it God did it Hallelujah will come upon you believe that and he says that the power of the highest the Holy Ghost shall come upon you and I'm telling you tonight right here right now [Music] it is saying the power of the Holy Ghost will overshadows he comes and changes your nature he said I will do a new thing leave your sins for the blood to come because that's what he came to do he paid it all yes uh my savior [Music] thy strength [Music] a child of wind weakness and finding me thy
