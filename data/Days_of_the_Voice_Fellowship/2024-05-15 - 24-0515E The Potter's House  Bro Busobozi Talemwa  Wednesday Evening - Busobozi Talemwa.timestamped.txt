[48:19] light
[48:21] and that means we shall go for an hour
[48:23] the Lord willing
[48:27] while you are still standing please turn
[48:30] to the Book of
[48:38] Jeremiah
[48:44] 18 vers 1 to 4
[49:00] [Music]
[49:06] the word which which came to Jeremiah
[49:09] from the Lord saying
[49:11] arise and go down to the Porter's house
[49:15] and there I will cause thee to hear my
[49:18] words then I went down to the Porter's
[49:21] house and behold he wrote a work on the
[49:24] vessels on on the wheels and the vessel
[49:27] that he made of
[49:29] clay uh that he made of clay was mad in
[49:32] the hand of the poter so he made it
[49:35] again another vessel as seemed good to
[49:38] the porter to make it then the word of
[49:41] the Lord came to me saying oh House of
[49:43] Israel canot cannot I do with you as
[49:47] this Porter sayith the Lord behold as
[49:50] the clay is in The Potter's hand so are
[49:53] ye in my hand oh House of Israel your
[49:56] name
[50:26] B for
[50:52] [Music]
[50:58] Isaiah 49:15 says can a woman forget her
[51:02] sucking child that she should not have
[51:04] compassion on the son of a womb yeah
[51:07] they may forget yet will I not forget
[51:10] thee behold I have Graven thee upon the
[51:12] palms of my hands thy walls are
[51:15] continually before me
[51:21] [Music]
[51:35] [Music]
[51:43] amen you may be seated may the Lord
[51:45] bless
[51:47] you so this evening I'm speaking
[51:51] on the Porter's house
[51:59] praise the name of the
[52:01] Lord amen I wanted to call you the
[52:03] Porter's hand or the Porter's house
[52:05] whichever you you
[52:11] want you see God dealt with Jeremiah in
[52:15] several ways and many of those were
[52:17] giving him
[52:23] signs he he he would give him a sign and
[52:26] then he would tell tell him this sign
[52:27] means this and this and
[52:30] this so when he wanted to tell him or to
[52:32] show him the condition of the House of
[52:36] Israel he took him he told him now
[52:40] Jeremiah I'd like you to
[52:43] arise and go down to the Porter's
[52:46] house and there I will cause you to hear
[52:48] my
[52:50] words God always wants to demonstrate
[52:53] things
[52:57] and the reason for that is because the
[52:59] way man works the way the brains of man
[53:04] works man works when he
[53:09] sees that is why the eyes are the doors
[53:12] to your
[53:14] heart what you see is very important a
[53:17] lot what you see DET Mees what you do
[53:22] because what you what you see goes
[53:24] directly to your heart
[53:27] and so he takes Jeremiah into the
[53:29] Porter's
[53:31] house and there he says I'll cause you
[53:33] to hear my
[53:35] [Music]
[53:36] words and he says then I went to the
[53:39] Porter's
[53:41] house and behold the porter wrote a work
[53:45] on the
[53:48] wheels you know I don't know if some of
[53:50] you have ever seen you know that that
[53:52] kind
[53:55] of e
[54:31] forget this is not God
[54:33] speaking they may
[54:35] forget yet will I not forget
[54:39] you behold I have Graven thee upon the
[54:43] palm of Palms of my
[54:47] hands thy walls are
[54:52] continually I believe it is as a pter
[54:56] now God
[54:57] here also takes another
[55:01] picture that he draws before our
[55:04] eyes and he draws a picture of a sucking
[55:09] mother and he says but can a sucking
[55:11] mother forget her
[55:14] child well of course some many of you
[55:16] may say
[55:17] no but you do not know that there are
[55:20] mothers who have forgotten their sucking
[55:24] children it has happened many times and
[55:27] so God says yes they may
[55:30] forget but he says but I have Graven
[55:34] thee upon the palm of my
[55:37] hands thy words are continually before
[55:41] me they may
[55:43] forget but I will not
[55:46] forget a mother can forget a child but I
[55:50] will not
[55:51] forget amen you know the pter Can Forget
[55:54] The Cay
[55:56] but our great Porter cannot forget his
[56:00] clay We Are The Clay in his
[56:03] hands he's the pter and we are the
[56:07] clay tell your neighbor I Am The
[56:10] Clay I Am The
[56:13] Clay and and um while I was reading
[56:17] this I thought cuz you see it just came
[56:20] to to me as a voice and I was like what
[56:23] does the Lord want me to talk about
[56:28] and so I took to study a little bit
[56:30] about
[56:32] it and
[56:35] found as I was taken as if to say as if
[56:40] Jeremiah as if I was
[56:45] Jeremiah and uh um you know I I was in
[56:50] my
[56:52] bedroom and um you know the revelation
[56:56] just struck
[56:57] me and I and I quickly called Edie I
[57:00] mean Ellie was everybody was
[57:03] outside they know whenever I'm studying
[57:05] I don't want any child to
[57:07] disturb so I shouted so
[57:11] highly amen hallelujah when the
[57:14] Revelation struck me it was a personal
[57:17] revelation this was for me and then Ed
[57:21] just quickly rushed in to see what was
[57:24] happening I don't see him here here and
[57:27] oh right there so and then I I I called
[57:29] him I said come here and I started
[57:32] preaching to him the inspiration I had
[57:34] received for our
[57:36] family out of this scripture I believe
[57:39] may God give you an inspiration for
[57:42] you for your family Hallelujah maybe
[57:47] I'll not be I not I'll tell you a little
[57:48] bit about what God revealed to
[57:51] us for my family the whole of last week
[57:56] I think before I think there's a sister
[57:58] who had received a a vision or I don't
[58:01] know what it
[58:02] was and she not I don't know why she
[58:05] didn't come to me but she went to
[58:06] Brother
[58:08] Martin told him Pastor is under attack
[58:11] and
[58:13] his and so she started praying for
[58:17] us and um and but she did not tell me
[58:21] but I had known I had also known about
[58:24] it that
[58:26] would be under
[58:27] attack and so but I do not know how and
[58:31] I had sent to a certain believer very
[58:34] far
[58:36] away and I told them we I am under
[58:38] attack and I need
[58:41] prayer I couldn't even tell tell them
[58:43] what kind of
[58:45] attack and and shortly after that and
[58:49] after the vision of the
[58:51] sister you know the Sunday that Pastor
[58:53] Gideon was here in the church
[58:57] uh you know he uh preached to us a very
[58:58] good you know sermon
[59:01] and but after the service my wife was
[59:04] very
[59:05] ill and uh you know she couldn't even go
[59:08] walk back home we had to drive her back
[59:12] home and after shortly after that then
[59:15] you know several of my children also you
[59:18] know took
[59:19] sick very terrible sickness and I was
[59:23] fine the whole time
[59:26] then on Friday is when I was
[59:30] attacked after very many
[59:32] years I remember when I was last sick
[59:35] that
[59:36] way if you ask me what I was sick from I
[59:38] do not
[59:40] know but I was terribly
[59:42] sick terribly sick and I did not want to
[59:46] scare my
[59:48] wife but I I was terribly see the way I
[59:52] felt and so um I knew I was under
[59:57] attack but I I I told the devil I am not
[1:00:01] going to accept
[1:00:04] this if the Lord has permitted it to
[1:00:07] come to
[1:00:08] me the Lord will take it away from me
[1:00:11] and um on on Sunday that is the second
[1:00:14] day of my being very
[1:00:17] sick I didn't even go to
[1:00:20] hospital although I encourage you to go
[1:00:23] to hospital
[1:00:26] I knew I was under
[1:00:27] attack and God showed it and everybody
[1:00:30] was
[1:00:32] praying I took I think my wife to
[1:00:35] hospital
[1:00:36] so don't say I don't believe in going to
[1:00:39] hospital and so I was
[1:00:43] afflicted and uh and I do not know why
[1:00:47] the whole
[1:00:49] time so when the Holy Spirit led me to
[1:00:51] this
[1:00:53] scripture I I got a big revelation
[1:00:57] and that's when I
[1:00:59] shouted here I saw myself go to this
[1:01:04] room as
[1:01:05] Jeremiah the Porter's house you know the
[1:01:08] Holy Spirit called it the porter said go
[1:01:10] to the Porter's
[1:01:12] house and Jeremiah walked he obeyed the
[1:01:15] voice of the Holy
[1:01:16] Spirit and he walked to the P's house
[1:01:20] and when he reached the Porter's
[1:01:22] house he saw the porter working on this
[1:01:25] vessel
[1:01:28] working on the
[1:01:30] wheels and the vessel that he made of
[1:01:32] clay was m in the hand of the
[1:01:38] pter it was mad but
[1:01:41] where in the hands of the porter it was
[1:01:45] spoiled but
[1:01:47] where in the hands of the porter brother
[1:01:50] sister let me tell you we are that
[1:01:53] vessel the Holy Spirit right there
[1:01:55] revealed to
[1:01:57] he said you are now that vessel and you
[1:02:00] are m in the hands of the
[1:02:03] pter but the pter after after the it was
[1:02:07] m in the hand of the
[1:02:09] porter the pter did not throw it
[1:02:12] away the made it
[1:02:16] again he made another
[1:02:19] vessel I believe it was a better
[1:02:22] vessel I believe it was a higher vessel
[1:02:27] be real now how many enjoy
[1:02:30] it how many don't enjoy it
[1:02:33] yet I wonder how many can put up their
[1:02:37] hands sister you put up to the
[1:02:40] middle how many don't enjoy it I don't
[1:02:43] know how
[1:02:45] many but why does that happen your
[1:02:48] heart's hanging on the weeping willow
[1:02:53] tree because your sins are separated you
[1:02:56] from the
[1:02:59] blessing he says I remember long
[1:03:01] ago when we used to come in
[1:03:04] here they would be playing down at the
[1:03:09] cross on a
[1:03:11] piano when the bail was being
[1:03:14] told there would hardly be a dry eye in
[1:03:18] the Church of course when they would
[1:03:20] when they would uh ring the bell many
[1:03:22] people would go to church they not time
[1:03:25] to go into church
[1:03:36] this is before the service would
[1:03:39] begin before the preacher would
[1:03:41] preach before the the song leer would
[1:03:45] sing there you would hardly find a dry
[1:03:49] eye in the
[1:03:53] CH everybody would be weeping
[1:03:59] slowly I just like that oldfashioned
[1:04:03] way that mellow that
[1:04:07] sweet the power of the Holy
[1:04:10] Spirit people broke
[1:04:14] up before we can ever make any
[1:04:19] Headway we have got to be broke up first
[1:04:26] that's why the Holy Spirit told me
[1:04:28] personally I'm breaking you to take you
[1:04:30] to another
[1:04:32] level and here I
[1:04:35] found he says before we can go to
[1:04:37] another
[1:04:39] level we
[1:04:48] have prophet of this
[1:04:50] generation and prophet of this
[1:04:53] generation and you still don't make it
[1:04:59] your yes now
[1:05:03] Lord hallelujah we need to talk more
[1:05:06] about
[1:05:07] that I feel this one hour will not be
[1:05:10] sufficient we will be able to talk about
[1:05:13] that
[1:05:13] again how God sometimes can break the
[1:05:16] human
[1:05:19] Spirit I'll show you many examples in
[1:05:21] the
[1:05:22] Bible That's why to some of you that
[1:05:25] keep hearing the
[1:05:28] and you you remain
[1:05:30] proud you you remain you remain
[1:05:33] unchanged you remain unwilling to to
[1:05:35] change to do what God wants you to
[1:05:39] do God has many ways and one of the ways
[1:05:43] he will tell you go to The Potter's
[1:05:46] House and when you reach in the Porter's
[1:05:49] house his intention is to break you into
[1:05:52] many
[1:05:54] pieces so that you can be able to humble
[1:05:57] yourself and hear his
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] voice I want to follow me
[1:06:05] closely and now and how that just like
[1:06:08] the
[1:06:09] ground if you're going to have a crop a
[1:06:14] crop you have to break your ground
[1:06:18] up te eat all to
[1:06:21] pieces and then plant your seed and it
[1:06:25] will come
[1:06:27] depends on what kind of seed you
[1:06:30] plant then while it has broken
[1:06:33] up so then while the ground is all
[1:06:37] broken it is time to plant a
[1:06:41] seed can you imagine many
[1:06:44] people have thought that they have
[1:06:48] seed well we have the message of Y oh we
[1:06:52] we have we have the Seven
[1:06:54] Seals we have Church
[1:06:56] ages oh we have this we have
[1:06:59] that yes they have all that but did you
[1:07:03] know you can have all the
[1:07:06] books and still don't make it
[1:07:09] to and you remain in the
[1:07:12] tribulation did you know how many knew
[1:07:14] that by way did you know that you did
[1:07:19] not some of you did
[1:07:21] not you can actually not only have them
[1:07:24] you can even study them
[1:07:29] listen to all the TS read all the
[1:07:32] messages you can read the whole Bible
[1:07:34] from cover to
[1:07:36] cover and still you may remain in the
[1:07:41] Rapture how
[1:07:42] come it is the
[1:07:45] ground in which you have put that
[1:07:50] word what what what pleases
[1:07:53] God what pleases God is a contrary
[1:07:57] Spirit whates God is is a broken
[1:08:01] heart not someone who is very
[1:08:04] hard not someone who is very
[1:08:07] proud whenever God sees something like
[1:08:11] that he just moves
[1:08:14] away but he will look upon a man who has
[1:08:18] a broken heart who has a contrite
[1:08:22] spirit someone who is teachable
[1:08:26] when amen when the seed of the word
[1:08:28] comes to such a
[1:08:31] heart what it does is it just begins to
[1:08:37] germinate then this Brethren who was
[1:08:39] going away from the promised
[1:08:43] land down into
[1:08:45] Babylon they were carried away because
[1:08:48] their sins had separated them from
[1:08:51] God and I'm just oldfashioned enough to
[1:08:54] believe tonight
[1:08:58] that when the church or any organization
[1:09:00] begins to play and flat with the
[1:09:08] world you are going to have the same
[1:09:14] experience getting away from
[1:09:17] God getting away from the truth I know
[1:09:20] it's the truth that's why we don't
[1:09:23] believe in playing and flatting with the
[1:09:24] world
[1:09:28] are you hearing me young
[1:09:30] people even older ones are
[1:09:32] like I believe
[1:09:35] Christians are not supposed to play and
[1:09:37] flat with the
[1:09:40] world if you believe that say a big
[1:09:43] amen Christians must never flat with the
[1:09:47] world we must never play with the
[1:09:50] world because when if we do that then we
[1:09:54] shall get away from
[1:09:56] God one brother one of our brothers did
[1:09:59] it brother
[1:10:01] Samson he began to Flat with the
[1:10:04] world I want you to
[1:10:07] imagine a woman would come to
[1:10:10] him and and and you know this
[1:10:14] and and the whole
[1:10:18] time like you if you're a
[1:10:21] Catholic a Believer is a Catholic
[1:10:27] Hallelujah if you believe in the
[1:10:30] Trinity your fellow believer is a
[1:10:35] traran if you believe in drinking
[1:10:38] alcohol your fellow believer is the one
[1:10:40] who
[1:10:41] drinks but as far as I'm concerned I
[1:10:44] don't believe in drinking I believe the
[1:10:47] one who believes like
[1:10:50] me I don't believe in
[1:10:53] adultery I is the one who believes
[1:10:57] like I I don't believe in child
[1:11:01] baptisms I believe is the one who
[1:11:04] believes like me I don't believe in
[1:11:07] makeup I believe is the one who believes
[1:11:10] like me I don't believe in women wearing
[1:11:13] trousers I believe the one who believes
[1:11:16] like
[1:11:17] me I don't believe in wearing almost
[1:11:20] half
[1:11:22] naked and you are putting on the high
[1:11:24] heels
[1:11:25] and going around meing around I don't
[1:11:28] believe that I believe the Bible teaches
[1:11:31] against that and fellow believer
[1:11:34] believes like
[1:11:35] me and you ask me who is a
[1:11:38] Believer it show that spiritual Amnesia
[1:11:43] somewhere we find that that's the same
[1:11:45] thing Samson
[1:11:48] suffered Sams had spiritual
[1:11:51] Amnesia let me tell you we have to
[1:11:53] separate
[1:11:55] and
[1:11:56] nonbelievers there is a very strong
[1:12:00] line praise the name of the Lord yes of
[1:12:03] course we want to love the whole
[1:12:06] world just like Jesus loved the whole
[1:12:09] world and he died for the whole world we
[1:12:13] will also love the whole world and die
[1:12:16] for the whole world by giving to them
[1:12:19] the the Jesus that died and
[1:12:22] resurrected but not by flatting with
[1:12:27] not by going to the Beer joints with
[1:12:29] them not going going to this kind of
[1:12:32] place filthy places with
[1:12:34] them not by playing cards with
[1:12:37] them not by you know Jing with them
[1:12:41] throwing dat jokes with
[1:12:43] them not by enjoying worldly music with
[1:12:46] them do I have a Believer here today by
[1:12:49] the way we will not do that we are
[1:12:53] Christians and we principles we stand
[1:12:58] for let me tell you as long as God is
[1:13:00] alive in
[1:13:02] heaven amen sin shall remain
[1:13:05] here but righteousness shall also remain
[1:13:09] because the word will remain preachers
[1:13:12] may choose to scale down on the
[1:13:15] word preachers may choose to reduce the
[1:13:18] power of the
[1:13:19] word by compromising on the word but I
[1:13:23] have news for you this evening
[1:13:25] God will have preachers that will never
[1:13:28] compromise on the word but will preach
[1:13:31] it the way it is the reason why they are
[1:13:34] compromising is because they compromised
[1:13:39] themselves but let me tell you brother
[1:13:41] sister we still have preachers and
[1:13:43] people who are fighting against
[1:13:46] sin who are fighting against
[1:13:49] unbelief and they are not willing to
[1:13:52] sett up for Less
[1:13:55] the only will to stand for what the word
[1:13:57] of God
[1:14:00] says we may not be the best but I
[1:14:02] believe we are one of
[1:14:05] them are you one of them
[1:14:08] tonight praise
[1:14:11] God
[1:14:13] hallelujah
[1:14:17] hallelujah
[1:14:18] hallelujah hallelujah well if you're
[1:14:20] saying a weak amen it means you're
[1:14:22] already compromised
[1:14:27] hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah
[1:14:30] yeah you say well brother amen I'm
[1:14:33] fighting and I'm overcoming and I will
[1:14:37] say
[1:14:39] Amen I'm going to be on the side of the
[1:14:41] right I'm going to be on the side of the
[1:14:43] oldfashioned
[1:14:45] Believers but what is the problem that
[1:14:47] we have
[1:14:49] today that Believers have refused to go
[1:14:52] to the P's house
[1:14:56] where are they they in the palace where
[1:15:00] are they they in the
[1:15:02] marketplace but they have refused to go
[1:15:05] to the P's house but God himself would
[1:15:09] come and tell a prophet go to the
[1:15:12] Porter's house so I will cause you to
[1:15:15] hear my
[1:15:16] voice and let me tell you we have come
[1:15:19] in the Porter's house
[1:15:22] tonight what do we see in the pter
[1:15:25] house you have to be broken up I've been
[1:15:29] in a Ministry now 20 years he says
[1:15:31] myself 17 years
[1:15:35] now and I've seen all different sorts
[1:15:38] and kinds of around the
[1:15:41] world but I tell you friends you may be
[1:15:45] looked down
[1:15:47] upon but I like an
[1:15:51] oldfashioned broke up meeting
[1:16:01] some of you people may not understand
[1:16:02] what I'm
[1:16:04] talking but what I'm talking about is
[1:16:08] singing and You Begin
[1:16:11] crying
[1:16:13] praying and You Begin
[1:16:16] soing hearing the word and You Begin
[1:16:20] crying that's what I'm talking about
[1:16:23] have you ever seen it in your life
[1:16:25] if you have never seen it in your life
[1:16:28] you have never been to The Potter's
[1:16:31] House you have never been and you need
[1:16:34] to I am not judging you tonight but I'm
[1:16:38] telling you you need to go into the
[1:16:40] Porter's
[1:16:41] house we have a lot of believers who
[1:16:45] know a lot of the message but they have
[1:16:47] never been to the P's house they don't
[1:16:50] know what Brokenness means they don't
[1:16:53] know what crying means
[1:16:55] they think it is just
[1:16:57] emotion that's why they talk against it
[1:17:00] but let me tell you it is more than
[1:17:02] emotion I know what it is because I've
[1:17:06] experienced it
[1:17:07] before and when you experience it you
[1:17:10] can never be the same again when you
[1:17:13] experience it something takes place on
[1:17:16] the inside of
[1:17:18] you Hallelujah someone come by one day
[1:17:22] and he said what I was preaching here
[1:17:26] and I'm quoting here William Bram
[1:17:32] 1960 1953
[1:17:35] rather some of you who don't know what
[1:17:36] I'm
[1:17:38] reading I
[1:17:40] can I can read these things because this
[1:17:43] is a man that God Vindicated in our
[1:17:46] generation and that's why we quote
[1:17:50] his how many believe his messages
[1:17:55] I I I I confess I'm not a very good
[1:17:58] quarter but when I do I really
[1:18:01] do so listen hallelujah huj praise the
[1:18:05] name of the Lord someone come by and one
[1:18:08] day and he
[1:18:09] said while I was preaching
[1:18:12] here he said Billy how could you
[1:18:16] preach and that woman sitting back
[1:18:20] there sing crying
[1:18:26] [Applause]
[1:18:31] saying I said maybe that was a whole lot
[1:18:35] of the reason why I was
[1:18:41] preaching that that thing made me
[1:18:46] preach and he said well what would just
[1:18:50] almost kill
[1:18:51] me that would just almost kill me if I
[1:18:55] was trying to
[1:18:57] talk if I was trying to talk and
[1:18:59] somebody carting on like
[1:19:03] that that would almost kill
[1:19:06] me I said it didn't hurt
[1:19:11] me brother it was encouraging
[1:19:16] me he
[1:19:18] said was she a horrible sin or
[1:19:23] something why was that
[1:19:26] woman was she a horrible
[1:19:30] sinner and we see we have the same
[1:19:32] churches
[1:19:35] today I'm imagining in in the
[1:19:37] denomination chur where I
[1:19:41] was a preacher come
[1:19:43] preach I'm imagining if a person would
[1:19:46] would stand up and say
[1:19:49] Amen everybody would be
[1:19:53] sh is that
[1:20:01] and this is what this
[1:20:03] person thank God delivered us from such
[1:20:07] churches we are here where there is life
[1:20:12] we are here where there is the word we
[1:20:15] are here where we are preaching about
[1:20:17] righteousness H going to heaven of the
[1:20:20] Holy Ghost
[1:20:26] Hallelujah is she a horrible sin or
[1:20:29] something I said no she was a
[1:20:33] Christian filled with the Holy
[1:20:36] Spirit and and the other person said and
[1:20:41] weeping I said yes the Bible said he
[1:20:46] that he that goth
[1:20:48] forth weeping shall doubtless return
[1:20:52] again bringing up with the him precious
[1:20:57] Shi hallelujah hallelujah am amen we you
[1:21:01] go sewing with
[1:21:03] weeping amen but when we come back again
[1:21:06] we shall bring precious
[1:21:10] Shields brother where is the Weeping in
[1:21:13] the
[1:21:14] church where is the breaking in the
[1:21:17] church whereby you sit like an officer
[1:21:20] in the
[1:21:21] church whereby you sit like a religious
[1:21:24] man
[1:21:25] woman why you see like somebody who is
[1:21:27] so
[1:21:28] holy oh let me tell you brother let us
[1:21:32] go back again to that oldfashioned
[1:21:35] religion where we
[1:21:38] break where when we hear the word say oh
[1:21:41] God I'm that sinner talking about have
[1:21:44] mercy on me and you are not ashamed to
[1:21:48] cry to break down you are not
[1:21:52] ashamed why because it is something
[1:21:55] to you it is a real
[1:21:58] reality you are not just faking
[1:22:01] Christianity we come here because we are
[1:22:03] bad and we want to be made
[1:22:08] good and if we are bad
[1:22:11] indeed when we hear the word of God it
[1:22:14] will send us into
[1:22:16] tears it will send us into saying
[1:22:19] amen it will make us
[1:22:22] emotional it will make us tional emotion
[1:22:26] doesn't change us but we are emotional
[1:22:29] because we are being
[1:22:33] changed hallelujah hallelujah he say
[1:22:35] that's right let me tell you if you
[1:22:39] don't have those people who say
[1:22:41] Amen if we don't have the people who are
[1:22:44] crying then we can't have
[1:22:48] church let us not go
[1:22:51] back where we came from
[1:22:55] we came
[1:22:56] from dead
[1:22:59] places and that's the
[1:23:02] truth where you can even hear a need of
[1:23:19] falling I don't
[1:23:22] know let me tell you
[1:23:25] these things that I'm talking
[1:23:26] about some of you don't
[1:23:29] know because all you have known is
[1:23:35] Pentecostalism and even the
[1:23:36] Pentecostalism you have
[1:23:38] known is the c
[1:23:41] one but some of us we were very reserved
[1:23:48] Christians myself I was I was in an
[1:23:50] Anglican
[1:23:52] Church I was very foral
[1:23:56] when they sing when they sing a
[1:23:58] song do you know how to play like them
[1:24:00] brother
[1:24:01] sh do you know how they
[1:24:04] play get oh you don't know I was asking
[1:24:07] you to get on the piano now I show
[1:24:09] you how who knows how to play like
[1:24:13] that just go there and begin stand up
[1:24:16] stand up for
[1:24:19] Jesus can you get do something for me I
[1:24:23] want to show you Church
[1:24:25] and and we were in
[1:24:28] bondage we were in
[1:24:30] bondage and you know they would
[1:24:34] begin stand up stand up for
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:48] Jus now when you feel that the song is
[1:24:52] touching you feel like tapping
[1:24:56] the best you can do is to tap the the
[1:24:59] feet but even when you do that someone
[1:25:02] looks at
[1:25:04] you and and you stop and you keep it all
[1:25:08] inside and that's why I'm saying we were
[1:25:11] liberated we did not come here to be
[1:25:14] like that we came here to be
[1:25:17] free we are a free
[1:25:20] people why because we have entered into
[1:25:23] The Potter's House
[1:25:25] we have come here to be
[1:25:26] broken to be broken into many pieces
[1:25:30] whereby all our pride
[1:25:33] Di and we are born
[1:25:35] again amen amen by in the Porter's hands
[1:25:39] he takes us into his hand and he molds
[1:25:42] another man he molds another
[1:25:46] character oh my hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:49] hallelujah amen put the first things
[1:25:53] first so
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:55] breaking up making
[1:25:59] over then just come
[1:26:01] rejoicing praise the name of the
[1:26:04] Lord hallelujah hallelujah and here in
[1:26:07] The Book of Mark
[1:26:10] 14:34 and Jesus said unto them my soul
[1:26:14] is exceedingly
[1:26:15] sorrowful unto
[1:26:18] death you here and
[1:26:20] watch and he went forward a little and
[1:26:23] fell on the ground
[1:26:27] if it were
[1:26:29] possible the hour might pass from
[1:26:32] him I wanted to see and he said father
[1:26:37] all things are possible unto you take
[1:26:39] away this cup from
[1:26:42] me this was
[1:26:45] Jesus this was Jesus our savior Our
[1:26:50] Redeemer and he says his
[1:26:53] soul was exceeding
[1:26:55] sorrowful un
[1:26:57] death and he went forward a
[1:27:00] little he left the disciples behind and
[1:27:04] when he reached there I would
[1:27:06] demonstrate for you but you won't see
[1:27:09] me fell down he didn't go down
[1:27:13] slowly like a religious
[1:27:16] man he fell down and as soon as he fell
[1:27:20] down he didn't behave as if he was
[1:27:22] praying in the house
[1:27:24] where is praying in the
[1:27:27] heart he was speaking words of
[1:27:31] desperation he fell to the ground and he
[1:27:35] prayed AB
[1:27:37] father all things are
[1:27:40] possible unto you take away this cup
[1:27:43] from me he didn't want to die he was
[1:27:46] trying to run away from
[1:27:49] dying but he says
[1:27:51] nevertheless not what I will
[1:27:54] but what you will let me show you
[1:27:57] something here Jesus feared the hour of
[1:28:01] death he had to come to The Potter's
[1:28:04] House Jesus entered into the Porter's
[1:28:07] house and that hour of fear and he fell
[1:28:11] down how do you enter in by prayer in
[1:28:16] here he had to have his own human will
[1:28:22] broken the way you can do do this is
[1:28:24] only through
[1:28:26] prayer and
[1:28:29] consecration not where everybody
[1:28:32] is personal private devotional
[1:28:38] prayer forget about the prayers we do in
[1:28:41] the
[1:28:43] church that's not what I'm talking about
[1:28:45] Jesus went with his
[1:28:47] disciples but when it reached that point
[1:28:49] of entering into the P's
[1:28:51] house he left them
[1:28:55] he left them behind and he went to
[1:28:58] another
[1:28:59] place
[1:29:01] alone he went to fight it
[1:29:04] out his will
[1:29:07] was I cannot
[1:29:10] die so you f it I
[1:29:16] canot take I I cannot no no no no no no
[1:29:20] no your word tells me that I cannot
[1:29:23] fornicate
[1:29:25] I want
[1:29:27] to he
[1:29:29] fought his
[1:29:31] flesh he fought his
[1:29:34] will he fought his
[1:29:37] desire he fought against it he he he was
[1:29:41] wrestling it together with
[1:29:45] God your will versus the
[1:29:49] word his will versus God word
[1:29:55] and he had to
[1:29:56] accept at the end of it all when he was
[1:29:59] walking out of The Potter's
[1:30:01] House he had to accept to
[1:30:04] die he says
[1:30:07] nevertheless not according to my will
[1:30:10] but according to your
[1:30:13] will we do we have to accept to
[1:30:16] die we have to accept to die to our self
[1:30:21] righteousness we have to accept to die
[1:30:24] to our
[1:30:26] pride drop and throw away your pride
[1:30:29] brother accept what the word is telling
[1:30:34] you accept to D your
[1:30:37] flesh accept to D your own
[1:30:42] understanding even that your own
[1:30:46] cultures that our
[1:30:51] wear accept and throw it away
[1:30:56] accept die to your
[1:30:59] cultures accept die to your
[1:31:02] tempers except it's a battle
[1:31:06] friends it's not it is easier said than
[1:31:10] done but we have to accept to
[1:31:14] die if you a liar accept to die to that
[1:31:19] demon of Lies accept that that Spirit of
[1:31:22] fornication and
[1:31:25] except to die you know to don't I tell a
[1:31:29] little Li and doesn't God doesn't
[1:31:33] mind fight
[1:31:35] it through
[1:31:37] prayer let your will
[1:31:40] die accept his word if the Bible says be
[1:31:45] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:31:48] Christ accept that your
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:51] unbelief and be born again
[1:31:55] and accept him as your savior and be
[1:31:57] baptized in his name if you don't
[1:32:01] accept then you have ran
[1:32:05] away from the Porter's
[1:32:07] house and you will remain with your
[1:32:12] pride and the Bible tells us that
[1:32:17] Pride
[1:32:19] precedes the fall
[1:32:24] and when you fall there will be no
[1:32:26] restoration
[1:32:29] for but when you accept to be
[1:32:32] broken you'll be
[1:32:34] ridiculed you'll be called a lot of
[1:32:37] things by your
[1:32:39] friends by your Associates sometimes by
[1:32:42] your
[1:32:42] family but you have to be willing to
[1:32:46] carry the cross of Jesus you have to be
[1:32:49] willing to take to to to to die to self
[1:32:55] he says forgive our many weakness Lord
[1:32:59] we
[1:33:00] don't we do many
[1:33:03] mistakes so in order to stay alive in
[1:33:07] Christ we have to die to our own
[1:33:10] thoughts so keep us
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:14] dead to ourselves and alive in
[1:33:18] him is that your prayer
[1:33:22] tonight let our body be soul and our
[1:33:25] soul so submissive to
[1:33:30] him to him that people will see the
[1:33:33] reflection of
[1:33:36] Christ as we
