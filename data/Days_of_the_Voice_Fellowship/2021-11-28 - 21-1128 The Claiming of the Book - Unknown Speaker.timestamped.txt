[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:36] um
[1:26:19] and they all came from those movements
[1:28:10] unless otherwise i don't expect to be
[1:28:12] long maybe one hour max man
[1:28:21] and i saw maybe i'll have to take this
[1:28:23] on again
[1:28:24] and again and again as lord leaders and
[1:28:27] i saw in the right hand of him that sat
[1:28:29] on the throne a book written within and
[1:28:31] on the backside sealed with seven seals
[1:28:33] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:28:36] with a loud voice who is rather to open
[1:28:39] the book and to lose the seals thereof
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:48] the root of david has prevailed to open
[1:29:50] the book and to lose the seven seals
[1:30:05] and when i turned to see
[1:30:07] in the midst of the throne of the
[1:30:08] phobists and in the midst of the elders
[1:30:10] stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:30:13] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:30:15] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[1:30:18] into all the earth
[1:30:38] okay now i want you to um i know we have
[1:30:40] read this many times
[1:30:43] and i want i want you to uh
[1:30:45] consider the lamb in this
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:30:50] you see when the voice spoke to john and
[1:30:53] told him that the lion of the tribe of
[1:30:56] judah has prevailed
[1:31:00] in
[1:31:13] was not slain that day oh man
[1:31:19] that lamb was slain before the
[1:31:22] foundation of the world
[1:31:28] i mean
[1:31:28] and so
[1:31:30] this was the lamb that was worthy
[1:31:33] oh no well you might win
[1:31:36] the lamb
[1:31:38] is the lion
[1:31:39] oh man
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:33:20] god became
[1:33:33] oh
[1:33:49] was inspired
[1:33:50] this part of the summer was inspired by
[1:33:52] the polycarp he asked me this question
[1:33:53] and this is a quarter he sent to me so
[1:33:55] i'm going to read it to you
[1:33:56] guys
[1:34:09] so you need to listen to every word it
[1:34:11] is just amazing it says now the mystery
[1:34:14] of the book are revealed again
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:40] are you listening
[1:34:41] are you a listening child my name is
[1:34:44] and when the seals completely are broken
[1:34:51] the time of redemption is over
[1:34:59] notice he said when the seals are
[1:35:02] completely broken
[1:35:09] the time of redemption is over
[1:35:12] okay listen because the lamb
[1:35:15] left the intercession post to work out
[1:35:18] to his claims
[1:35:26] there are different things here we'll
[1:35:27] talk about it i mean he was a mediator
[1:35:30] between that
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:33] but when the re-revelation
[1:35:36] happens on the seals as they begin to
[1:35:38] pray
[1:35:54] he took the book the apartheid
[1:35:57] so it's no more media cutting
[1:36:00] because even they
[1:36:02] called him a lion and that's the king
[1:36:07] and he's not a mediator then
[1:36:12] now there are three phases
[1:36:15] or three parts
[1:36:16] within of the breaking of this seal
[1:36:22] while it or maybe trying to be certain
[1:36:26] one so it happens
[1:36:29] from what we read here one way to vote
[1:36:31] summer revelation five oh could become
[1:36:36] what happened
[1:36:38] it was it was broken when the lamb which
[1:36:41] was already slain oman
[1:36:46] but that wasn't seen in symbol form
[1:37:03] younger believers when they begin to
[1:37:04] hear the word sealed standards they
[1:37:06] begin to okay pastor i'll be here the
[1:37:08] next service so please i wanted to open
[1:37:10] your house
[1:37:18] this is the food for believers
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:32] amen
[1:38:15] they are again broken
[1:38:17] to brother branham
[1:38:19] by revelation
[1:38:25] and you and i know that brother bannon
[1:38:27] preached
[1:38:28] on this revelation of the seven seals
[1:38:35] and he took it one seal by one by one by
[1:38:38] one all the seven seals
[1:38:52] but when you read actually
[1:38:54] i was shown it by a brother that was
[1:38:56] amazed
[1:39:09] which he recorded
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:52] of the mystery
[1:40:06] but you can see
[1:40:20] but
[1:40:48] and so it was all revealed in our time
[1:40:54] but that book
[1:40:56] follow me now here
[1:40:59] the lamb took the book
[1:42:11] so he has to literally come
[1:42:26] but before the rapture happens
[1:42:30] we are in the process of the claiming of
[1:42:32] the book
[1:42:36] let me
[1:42:37] let me bring it this way continuously
[1:42:41] when the lamb died on the cross oh man
[1:42:43] we have masala he paid it
[1:42:45] all
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:49] jesus
[1:42:50] paid it oh yes
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:49] which is claiming
[1:44:04] any
[1:44:32] there is no claim on it
[1:44:36] there is no crime on it
[1:44:39] but then
[1:44:40] the complete
[1:44:43] phase of the claiming
[1:45:10] now i want us to look at this part where
[1:45:12] it says
[1:45:14] that uh
[1:45:15] the comp the seals are broken and when
[1:45:17] the seals completely are broken the time
[1:45:20] of redemption is overlapping
[1:45:27] with
[1:45:43] people know that brother bannon preached
[1:45:45] on the revelation of the seven seals
[1:45:50] there are some groups
[1:45:52] which preach and say
[1:45:55] there is no more massive
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:26] you sang a very good song speak my lord
[1:46:27] speak send me out in the field because
[1:46:29] we believe commander took it jesus is
[1:46:32] still in the massachusetts
[1:46:35] and he is still saving the sinners
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:47:22] maybe for the sake of the brethren that
[1:47:24] uh have just joined us let's just open
[1:47:26] revelation 10.
[1:47:33] comey
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:48:12] all right let us go back again to verse
[1:48:14] one
[1:48:15] read from that let us read from boston
[1:48:22] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:48:24] from heaven close with a cloud and the
[1:48:25] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:48:28] was as it were the sun and his feet as
[1:48:30] pillars of fire nine
[1:48:41] and remember this is the same one
[1:48:44] that did the work of redemption
[1:48:49] is a confident angel
[1:48:52] yeah and who is it
[1:48:54] it is none other than our lord jesus
[1:48:56] christ
[1:49:12] his
[1:49:23] and when he had he cried seven thunders
[1:49:25] out of their voices
[1:49:40] their voices i was about to write and
[1:49:44] and i had a voice from heaven saying
[1:49:45] unto me seal up those things with the
[1:49:47] seven that i found as other than write
[1:49:49] them now
[1:49:51] everywhere to come
[1:49:53] together
[1:50:08] amen follow me here now notice that the
[1:50:10] angel tells john malaysia
[1:50:14] to seal up
[1:50:16] the things that the seven thunders have
[1:50:18] happened
[1:50:22] and he was told
[1:51:03] [Applause]
[1:51:05] talking about
[1:51:06] the end of the ceiling of these things
[1:51:14] when the time comes
[1:51:16] the fullness of time comes
[1:51:46] thunders attack everywhere to come
[1:51:48] somewhere
[1:51:49] don't write it down obviously
[1:51:52] but then we see what does it say
[1:51:56] on verse six
[1:51:58] and i swear by him and leave it forever
[1:52:00] and ever who killed heaven and earth and
[1:52:03] the thing that they are in ah and the

[1:52:10] are there are in and and that there
[1:52:12] should be time no longer
[1:52:28] the time of
[1:52:54] of the voice
[1:52:56] of the seventh
