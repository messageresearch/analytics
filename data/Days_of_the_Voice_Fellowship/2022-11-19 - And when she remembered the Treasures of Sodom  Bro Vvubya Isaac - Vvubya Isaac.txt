Hallelujah and see what Lotus wife did praise the one of the name of Jesus Christ but his wife looked back from behind him Hallelujah and she became praised in the name of Jesus Christ they went out of Sodom so Sodom Hallelujah by the help of the Angels after hearing the message but the message was live out of Sodom Sodom but don't look back praise the name of Jesus Christ [Music] the Church of God foreign foreign [Music] foreign hallelujah hallelujah until the day during the days of his coming back it is going to be in the same way it was in the days of Solomons praise God and we are waiting for the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and you have seen all the acts the same acts as it was in the cities of Sodom and government and these are the days that our Lord Jesus Christ talked about yesterday that as thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed praise God in that day he which shall be upon the house and his staff in the house which day the day for the second coming over he which shall be upon the house and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise praise God our Lord told us don't even think back of the world it will happen to be on the house don't come back to pick anything from your house as you're picking it you'll be left out praise God hallelujah and then he said if you'll be found in the field praise God foreign [Music] [Music] we shall start from verse 38 to Japan and see what the lord requires Hebrews chapter 10. what God requires from you as a Believer as a Christian you claim to be a Christian hallelujah hallelujah because in the first time the Bible says for this is good acceptable in the sight of Our Lord praise God hallelujah like all men to get saved but when you get saved praise God to come to the knowledge the whole truth of the Bible foreign [Music] whatever the Bible tells you to do you do Bible check down but you're not called when it tells you not to do you don't but I'm not talking okay don't say this was for Paul this was supposed idea for me I think the Bible here because the Bible yet again that's how they listen the word of God to eat the Lambs [Music] so that is why when we get saved yes we have to come to the holy truth hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah now they just shall live by faith but if my soul shall have no pressure when you come to him when time comes and you draw back I don't know his uh he he uh he's he has no his soul has no pressure in any person that draws back [Music] praise God he wants you to come out and then you go forward that is why he told the church that you remember what his wife yes because she get she got out of the city but then she looked back she received a message but then she took half of the message she said I love this this one I want to do it but that one I won't take it you know praise God he said remember praise God praise God the Church of God so today in the same way we are being told never to draw back to them praise God for doing this the very things that we used to do hallelujah hallelujah but of them that believe to be saving of their soul now that was post-confession and it should be your confession praise God I am to go forwards and take it to again praise God [Music] Uganda let us get there Philippians have a Philippi uh chapter 3 verse 13 is praise God hallelujah hallelujah it says I count not myself to have apprehended severeign [Music] there is some destruction that is soon setting in praise God there are some Lords they're going to be saved from the cities praise God but still we are having some Lotus wives influences [Music] [Music] [Music] I mean Hallelujah listen what he says 1964.02 15. influences amen he says I think if we had the people today then there was a singer today our churches who claim to be Christians if they would abstain from the things of the world and live that kind of a life it would influence the younger Christians praise God but today when they let down and drinks and still try to hold their confessions now that is the problem the church has got these days the problem the church has changed some people's legs are in the world and the other one in church praise God he comes from boosting then he comes in church yet he says I am a believer praise God but what comes to such people if they don't repentance [Music] because she received the whole message then she took half of it she said this is for the pastor this is for the ministers whatever God before brings judgment he has to bring a warnings Hallelujah I think it behooves us tonight hallelujah hallelujah for every woman knows that you are coming to judgment you might escape this is you might beat the income tax you might escape the internal revenue hallelujah hallelujah you might do one thing you might have run over the Speedy limits praise God that is certain praise God Amen it is the same judgment that came to Lord his wife she received the message but then took half of it because of the treasures she thought of the things she missed yeah praise God I mean she thought of her children God calls you he calls you alone praise God if your children tends to get away from the world see don't follow them your lord is to go down on your knees Saturday they might come back to the message but if you say my true my child is like this she was stumbled in this way foreign [Music] and you know I told my knee paragraph 92 and you know the voice Never Dies it never died there is science in the 20 years if they can progress as they have now they will pick up the literal voice of Jesus Christ when he was on Earth praise God hallelujah hallelujah and neither does the words that you speak yeah they will meet the Bible says we shall all appear foreign verse verse verse 10. hey there have you got there because second Corinthians 5 yeah it says foreign Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah time comes and then they look back I said praise God by the message this evening to you from God is that you don't you should not look back hallelujah hallelujah like Lord his wife when she remember the treasures when she remembered her children then she looked back that is where judgment came hallelujah praise God come out 10 days away hallelujah hallelujah and in this message look our way to Jesus foreign goronaku and turn the dark negurioca the Stars didn't come out to give its life with locks and the Earth burst forth with the Lord [Music] and ripped the Tampa Bay from the top to the bottom and the people running and screaming they didn't know what had taken place [Music] but it was too late he looked and believed but it was too late for him to believe what he had done had sealed his Doom yeah he had ran the spear through the savior's heart it was too late I wonder how many Romans today have done the same thing and they will do the same thing you might look someday but it might look too late will come in that day and be the same way praise God hallelujah hallelujah says he had PS3 and that was too late for him he had had all the messages praise God but then it was too late for him because time was over Hallelujah he had already made his judgment there was no extrus for him the same thing that happened to Lotus wife she had had a message from the two angels who are The Messengers praise God but when she decided to intentionally turn and looked back again so when we intentionally do what the Bible tells us never to do it together praise God we might cross Mercy away and then we might find ourselves on a judgment days in the same way what am I trying to say that they see they clearly Vindicated the word like pilate and the rest of them like the Roman soldiers but are you going to wait too late to do anything about it hallelujah hallelujah he should have used the spear the other way those will be closed like it was in the days and then it is too late Hallelujah so Church of God what does God requires a once we came out of the world let us not look back like hallelujah hallelujah let us leave all the treasures there and enjoy the treasures in the world hallelujah hallelujah though they are small so much praise God hallelujah hallelujah because it won't profit any man to eat the whole world that is what the Bible says praise God come attend this away that what will the prophet a man in Matthew chapter 16. what will the prophet a man to eat the whole world this is what the Lord asked praise God the lord requires [Music] because first of all no one who constrained you to come to Christ when you had a gospel then you said this is the truth Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah in this message sir we would see Jesus well now maybe this didn't mean that oh yeah don't you never believe that everywhere that God is the world is God and see against it the word is so it cannot failure doesn't make a difference look now look now look katunura when Lord was called out on Sodom Bluetooth you people remember the story now the angel said to Lord and his wife his family don't look back and now think of that mother not his wife her children were burning up down there yeah judgments of God her grandchildren were burning up in the judgments and she stands there yet today [Music] we know that see it makes a difference when you go God says anything it means just what he says praise God come at 10 days away now how many in this building both Indian and white now brother was asking God just me means just exactly what it says you have in the world foreign is not a story to to help to maybe to uh for you to enjoy see if I want to go be created to know where are they falling from what you were about before you might stand because that you might overcome praise God Amen so the things
