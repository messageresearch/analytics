Bibles [Music] please we are going to the Book of Malachi Malachi chapter uh chapter chapter 4 amen is that this microphone so this verse we have read quite a few times now I think this this is the fourth time but uh we are still building the foundation to the to this same verse and uh we shall go into the depth of it as we continue in in this series behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and you can be seated so we are speaking on the ministry of Elijah in the end time the ministry of Elijah in the end time so this is part four to that um the Christian world is the Christian world is waiting for what we call the coming of the Lord but there are two types of waiting you can wait for the Lord to come when you know how he will come and when he will come or you wait blindly but if you wait blindly he may actually come and you don't know but if you know the signs of his coming and you know the prophecies pertaining to his coming you cannot miss him when he comes because you were waiting if someone tells you there is a man coming to do something for for you and you know he has a gift for you but that man is dressed in a red shirt and a black coat so when you stand on the on on the way waiting for that man you will be waiting for a man with a a red shirt and a black coat but because someone told you and you've been waiting so you knew what you were waiting for but if someone tells you there is a man coming and is's bringing a gift for you that's all you know and you wait by the Lord you will wait forever that man may come and pass you may never recognize that he has even already come and G you will miss the day of your visitation only because you did not know the specifics of his coming are you following me this morning amen many people this morning they waiting for the coming of the Lord how many are waiting for the coming of the lord we all are waiting for the coming of the Lord you know the whole chrisom is waiting for the coming of the Lord but the question is how many know how he is going to come and when he is going to come very few know actually when he came the first time you can use that as an example the Bible says he came among his own you read it in the book of uh John chapter one praise God he came unto his own and his own received him not this is verse 11 this was the listen listen now of course during this subject we know that we are learning so I'm not really preaching as much as I always do we're just trying to learn a few foundations of our faith what we believe what we stand for so if you learn something new and you have a question write it down I'll be glad to deal with it later so now when we talk about the first coming of Jesus the Bible says he came unto his own and his own received him there are prophecies which were given about the coming of the Messiah all the Jews knew it I'm talking about all the Jews and all those that were reading the Torah they knew the prophecy of the coming of the Messiah and they were waiting but the question is when he came did they recognize him they did not the Bible says he came unto his own but his own received him not you know Isaiah is one of the prophets that prophesied about his coming and isah prophesied and said unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the Govern shall be on his shoulders his name shall be wonderful counselor Prince of Peace are you hearing me this is a prophecy of Isaiah he prophesied and the Jews believed it they believed it they read it every time in their Temple but here when Jesus came and he healed someone on the Sabbath day on the Sabbath day he healed that woman when they saw that they said what did you just break the Sabbath day how could you do that and he looked at them and he said who among you that your when your camel falls into the ditch on the Sabbath you do not remove it Hypocrites you hypocrite Christ meaning you to actually break the Sabbath day and you are here blaming me for breaking the and then he said come unto me that La a heavy lad I will give you rest for your soul what the Sabbath means sabath means rest but Jesus say unto me I will give you so Jesus came with the real Sabbath people were resting from their natural works but he had come to give them a Sabbath which will make them rest from their sins from The Works of their flesh and he had come to give it but he came among his own and his own received him not what did they tell to him they said now we know when he said before Abraham was I am they said you are not even 50 years old how can you say that you were there in the Days of Our Father how can you say he said if you don't believe I am here you will die in your sin who is he the am the am that Moses made the one who said to Moses I am who I am says if you don't believe I am he he that met Moses he that was prophesied that he will come he that created the Heaven and the Earth Jesus never said thus say the Lord oh the prophet said thus say the Lord meaning God is telling me to say Isaiah said thus say the the th the Jesus he never said th say the Lord because he was the Lord himself when he came down he said very very I say unto you who was that what man of man is this that Cals the ring SE what man of man is this raises the dead what man of man is this he was The Lord Of Glory he was the great he was Jehovah God Jesus Is God and it's a revelation received even today in our h some people think Jesus is just a second person of the Trinity there is nothing like Trinity in the Bible Trinity is a doctrine of the Romans it is not a Bible Doctrine if you find the word trity in the Bible praise God come for a gift and I will also repent on top of that there is no word Trinity in the Bible doctrine of the of the Romans which they have sent all over the world but the bride will escape such a the bride will believe in the one God of the Bible the god of Isaac the god of Jacob the god of Israel one God he says I am the Lord and that is my name and I will not give my my my praise have Graven image praise the name of the Lord and so Jesus was God in flesh and when he came the Jews said now at first they told him now we know you have a devil we know the things you speaking we can see you have a devil and then when he continued speaking what they consider to be blasphemy they told him now you don't only have a devil you himself they called Jesus the people who would go back to their Temple and they would read unto us it's a religious service so we are reading the scripture unto us a child is born a son is given and then they come to Jesus you are they would go back in the temple unto us son is the prophec is about him and they calling him and yet they would go back and read about you talk about spiritual blindness they were blind they couldn't oh friends I want you to understand this who was Jesus he was the one that every Prophet spoke about all the prophets and the Lord pointing to him Jesus Jesus was the Fulfillment I can talk about Prophet Prophet from Prophet to Prophet they all prophesied about Jesus everything they did was about Jesus praise God when you talk about Moses in the in the Old Testament when he put up that stick and he put that Brazen Serpent and whoever was beaten by snakes when he look or not he would be healed what was that that was a symbol talking of Jesus who went on the cross to judge the serpent the Bible says he became s that we might become the righteous even Moses prophesied of eel so him as a whe in the midle of the wheel Daniel he saw a Rock which was very huge and then there was a hand there was a one which was cut out of it without a hand cut out of it and then it came from Heaven down to the Earth listen you remember the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar where he had seen that thing and he had seen what is it called this um you know statue and he had seen it the head of gold and you know the the the feet of clay and and and you know all that but what was that talking about listen to me he was speaking of the kingdoms of of the Gentiles that would rule the world from that time up to the end time that was what it was talking about it was beginning with the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar was the kingdom of was the head of God how many are following all right so the kingdom of nead was the head of God and the last Kingdom to come was having two things in it clay mixed rather iron mixed with what does that symbolize the the because ion is Rome Roman power Roman Kingdom you know the kingdom of of Rome one time ruled the whole world but the very last one mixed with Clay that's protestantism and romanism mixed together so it is romanism going to rule the world the last Kingdom to come of the Gentiles how many understand today I'm going into a bit of deep things I want follow now but regardless of all those kingdoms of course Nebuchadnezzar when he saw that he was the head of God he said okay put that stat there and let everybody worship when you hear the sound of the timos the drums then everybody shall bow down and worship the image but yet he was just the head of God and he felt so good he felt he should be woried but there were three boys they said We Shall Not Bow we shall not Bend we are not going to worship man we're not going to worship the systems of only God we shall only God we shall Ser today we have a people who will not worship any manade system we shall Ser only God we shall worship and and and and you know but you see there's another thing here that there was a stone that came and hit this IM and it was completely dism destroyed completely the image was destroyed completely now the image represents the kingdoms of the world the stone represents the kingdom of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah the Bible says the kingdoms of the world have become the kingdom of our God if your kingdom is in this world it's okay you can go and fight on the road and you hold blackards everywhere every but as far as I'm concerned my kingdom is not yes I know I'm going to rule in this world but not in its current system when his kingdom comes he will destroy all the systems of the world and he will put another system where he is the king of kings and the Lord of lords and he will rule for a thousand years and I'm going to be down here ring together with him yes I'm going to be a ruler Hallelujah the Bible says we are Kings and we are priests so now Jesus is the one that will have an everlasting Kingdom if you are part of his kingdom I Want to Say You Will Rule with him we have a song that says the Saints of the Lord shall take the kingdom they shall rule forever more I will rule I'm going to sit in the the day is coming I'm going to sit in the thr that's why they're stealing our soul that when the battle is over we shall wear a crown that is our soul we have a crown we are going to and we are fighting now we are fighting with sin but one of these days hallelujah oh Hallelujah we are going to drop this flesh we going to drop this flesh Hallelujah just like you will be changed no more sin no more sickness no more these things no more trouble and we shall have a body that cannot die we shall have a body that canot not sin that is the body that is going to rule because it will have character will have the nature of Jesus but right now we are fighting we are fighting brother fight sister fight don't accept defeat we must fight and win in order to rule so even Daniel spoke of Jesus every Prophet spoke of Jesus Jesus and the Jews were waiting Isaiah 61 says the spirit of the Lord God is upon me he has anointed me brother I wish you would just give me that quite quickly you know so that I can be able to quote it for the people praise God hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach the Good Tidings unto the men he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted Amen to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that abound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord these word we prophesied by Isaiah and Isaiah people did not understand but they need was a prophecy because a prophet prophesies and then here years later a man are you following me and he stands in the temple and takes the Bible and he find he looks for this place he looked which means he knew what he wanted to he looked for this place and he read this part the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach the Good Tidings unto the me he sent me to bind up the broken heart to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to the to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of when he had read that everybody looked at him and he said this day is this scripture fulfilled do you think they understood they're like what what what is talking that is speaking about the Messiah hope he's not thinking he's the Messiah does he think he the Messiah come on this is a son of Joseph and Mary he was born in Jerusalem these people I believe they had prepared virgins virgins in their temp because the prophecy also said a virgin shall conceive and bear a son so they must have prepared virgins that the spirit of God will choose among them in their religious system a virgin shall conceive are you following me a virgin shall conceive is it the scripture is it a prophecy a virgin shall conceive the angel said it so they must have waited for it maybe they prepared some virgins and they waited for the angel to come so one of them can conceive maybe every every two months every month they went back to ask anyone pregnant anyone pregnant no let us wait another us with another moreover whereas the the organization was preparing all those things they did not know you cannot organize God God will do what he has to do and He will fulfill his word anyway whether people see it or not whether they believe it or not God will fulfill his word regardless of your even regardless of what is going on in the world religious systems they may all reject him but he will fulfill his word while they were doing all those things organizing God God was very busy also fulfilling his word out of the organization we are not an organization God is fulfilling his word among us hallelujah while the organizations see they have God they they organized they see they know how he is going to come they don't know they are blind they don't know they naked but there is a bride there is a church all over the world God is preparing to Rapture a bride out of the organization out of the systems of the world he will leave them in the organization while he bundling his bread together making us one with the word and they were very busy waiting for the virgins to conceive but God himself fisted his right glory and when came to this Mary he said You shall conceive he says how shall these things be he says the Holy Ghost will overtake you the power of the most high will overshadow you me tell you how shall these things be how shall we go in the Rapture how shall our bodies be changed the Holy Ghost will overtake us the power of the most high will overshadow you hallelujah hallelujah when the power of the Holy Ghost overshadows you Begins by healing your body if you are sick it begins by healing your body and he heals every disease there is no disease he cannot heal he will heal cancer he will heal tuberos he will heal HIV he will heal every sickness and then after that he says he will overshadow you and then you will be changed twinkling of an ey how shall It Be by the power of the Holy Ghost the systems will continue in their own ways while he is very busy doing his things and then while very bus doing that a virgin shall conceive can you imagine the Virgin conceived the Virgin gave birth and they were still reading vir they were still waiting for prophecy to be fulfilled which was already fulfilled standing before them a virgin shall conceive you you have you B someone needs to see I wish someone would open their eyes show them this is the one that was concealed this is the son that was promised to come this is Jehovah God I wish someone would open and that's why Jesus he spoke to them many times and they said they sons of Abraham he said you are not sons of abrah because if you were sons of Abraham you would have believed me why because Abraham Reed to see my day and he was glad when Abraham see Jesus who was not even 50 years old this was not Jesus the son speaking this was Jehovah God Jesus speaking to this people he was the one that told Abraham I will be with you according to the time of life and your wife Sarah will have a child this was the one who came to in the tent and he spoke to him this was the one Abraham PA T to this was the one asked Abraham why did sah your wife laugh this was the one who told Abraham Now give me your little boy and when Abraham went to sacrifice his little boy in the mountain his boy cried said father where is the sacrifice Abraham said the Lord shall prepare a sacrifice shall provide a sacrifice maybe you have nothing to sacrifice the Lord shall provide a sacrifice the Lord shall provide a and he will save your children he will save your children for you if you believe it Abraham said it by faith and that's why he's the father of Faith because by faith he believed God will provide a sacrifice and then as he was going to kill his son god Jehovah he spoke to him and he said Abraham don't kill your son stop stop Abraham just stand by the side there is a sacrifice God provided a sacrifice I believe Abraham Rejoice AB say hallelujah hallelujah my son is not going to die hallelujah hallelujah my son is saved Abraham rejoiced and years later Jesus is standing before them and he saying before Abraham was I am and Abraham rejoiced to see my Hallelujah it was him that was there at that time but they had eyes they could not see they had ears they could not hear because they missed the part of Prophecy that was going to prepare them to receive the Messiah they missed it when the Messiah came they were blind as a BT he was right there before them but they didn't recognize him have a song in they sing he came to oh are you this young you don't know that song he came to his own the Earth did not recognize him he came to support them did not know him they didn't recognize him was he he was Jehovah God in flesh oh hallelujah hallelujah and Jesus he came for a purpose the purpose was to deliver the were in prison the purpose was to save the captives the purpose was to die on the cross but when he came the first time they did not recognize I ask you a question why the reason is one because they missed the ministry which was supposed to prepare [Applause] them to receive the Messiah before the Messiah comes oh I feel so so good right now before the Messiah come there must be an Elijah Ministry Elijah Ministry is to prepare the people to receive the messah to receive God when he comes down on the sin praise God for he says in the Book of Malachi 4:5 behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before please open it in your Bible each of you in your Bible this is a little bible study together now I want us to understand what we believe are you there okay if you're there now we read 1 2 3 go verse 5 behold before of the and of the Lord Elijah the prophet is coming when before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord there is coming a day brother give us verse one there is coming a day that the Bible says right here amen that for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven that day is coming tell somebody that day is coming that day is coming bur over is going to be the Dreadful day of the to be very Fierce it's going to be a bad day if you will for people who did not receive Elijah Elijah comes for one purpose to prepare the people to be saved by receiving the Messiah the Messiah is Jesus no man else no one else we ever worship we should only worship one and that is Jesus why because it's the Lord of Lord the King of Kings he's the god of the Bible but Elijah comes for a purpose to prepare people before the coming of the Lord that day is coming oh I said that day is coming I said that day is coming whether you believe it or not the day that shall burn is coming and I am not a Hell Fire preacher but I'm a preacher that is I Rapture preacher I'm telling you about the Rapture because I don't want you to go to Hell Fire I want you to be saved I want it to be Rapture but now the day is coming that is great and that is Dreadful this is a prophetic now I'll just give you a little bit and then maybe in the future Services I'll expound it more I want to ask you a question was the coming was the coming the first coming of Jesus was it Dreadful was it burning as an oven so it was not Dreadful the first one it was not Dreadful do you agree with me if I tell you the first coming of Jesus was great why was it great anybody why was it great come on now why was it great yes somebody anybody the Messiah was being born anybody with a better answer yes he had come to save The Sinner the first coming of Jesus he had come to save The Sinner so it was great not so the Savior comaling down it was great he died on the cross it was great not for him but for us and also for him because he loved us so it was great it was great because he came to do the work of redemption it was great but not Dreadful give me that scripture again are you there behold verse five beh I send you Elijah the prophet who shall do what shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers now please understand El we are still looking at Elijah in the beginning we shall build it up until we start this properly but we cannot understand the ministry of Elijah in the end time without understanding his nature in the beginning are you hearing me when Elijah comes he will turn the hearts of the father's children before the day four people here come up quickly brothers who are willing to preach with me thank you four two more one more please quickly now here we have we we we we have Elijah so this is the Messiah the first time he came Jesus is first coming if you understand you say Amen the first coming of Jesus and this is the second coming of Jesus has this happened has this happened no we are still waiting for him to come back the second time now his second coming is called the Dreadful day of the Lord his first coming is called the great day of the Lord are you following but now the prophecy is saying brother put it up there verse four chapter 4 verse 5 behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet Elijah the prophet before everybody before the great and before the Great and The Dread before the great day of the Lord before the Dreadful day of the Lord I will send you Elijah are you following are you following now when Jesus had not yet come the first there had to be an elij to come if people saw this elij if they believe this Elijah they would receive the Messiah but because they did not know when he came when the Messiah came they called him because they were still blinded they did not receive the ministry which was going to help them understand who the Messiah is oh my now John the Baptist was the Elijah which came before the messiah's coming in this service I'm not explaining that I'll explain it in another service now we are waiting for the Messiah to come the second time but we must receive a before the dread must first come and restore all things [Music] oh my God hallelujah I'm preaching a sermon for another day now but let me say this El has come this El has come when is the is the Messiah coming to to to come and do the Rapture and also destroy the others he coming soon but before he comes this is the time Elijah must come anybody who doesn't receive this Elijah will not be prepared for the Rapture so I don't see how he goes in rupture this is a we dealing with Bible prophecy here Elijah's Ministry comes to prepare these people here for the rapture but if they don't receive this Elijah there is no way they will go no absolutely but I want to declare to you today El has come El has come this church and many others around the world telling the world that we have El message and message is preparing us for the coming of the Lord that's why we don't have time to make organizations and religions we don't have time for that we don't have time to make denominations we don't have time the only time we have amen is to prepare for the coming of the Lord using Elijah's message and I say Elijah is come Elijah is come and his message is already here if you don't know it I don't know whether you're going to Rapture listen to his message he his message he's also the seventh angel messenger when he begins to sound the mystery of God shall be finished after him no more the only thing left is the rapture Elijah has come we are in the days of the voice of the seventh angel God bless you Brothers hallelujah hallelujah Elijah is come we have a reason to Rejoice you have a reason to Rejoice oh my you can sit in the chair and look at me but I to I have a reason to Rejoice sister fortunate I have a reason to Rejoice to be excited about because Elijah is Elijah is come the mystery is finished the Seven Seals are open the mystery is finished we are only left with one thing the Rapture I am thinking about the rapture I am thinking about the r we are the people that God is going to C we are the brother God is going to come I am one of them you are one of them hallelujah hallelujah we are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we are filled with the Holy Ghost the only thing left is Rapture hallelujah hallelujah the devil can stop it that's why our emphasis in this church is not bring a seed it's not so a SE it's not give give give no we believe in giving our emphasis is the coming of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah the devil can't stop it because it is too late for him elah is already come I've been watching the other day I was watching this preach of ours here in CA Grace a I should have AP we need to respect man of God and so he he said something about William Bram and said oh William Bram was a mighty Prophet you cannot equate him to any other in he had a real gift of God and he talked about the pill of fire he doesn't even understand what of fire sign you think God just comes for a show this is the same pill of Fire the days of of Moses this was some of fire that met Paul people don't understand why did he come to meet Paul because he was sanctioning Paul for Ministry of the AL my God I feel like speaking right he was he was consecrating Paul for the alpha minister of the end time bride and when he came on on William he was consecrating for the Omega Ministry of the same end time these people don't understand they see it is a small thing God just came for a picture show this is prophetic this is this is prophesied to happen is up to you to open your eyes to be blind but I choose to open my eyes see Bible prophecy and Apostle Grace was saying but even William Bram you know God took him because he he sinned by bringing a wrong Doctrine I see he that's why God took him in a car accident well before you talk about that can you talk about John the Baptist Hallelujah glory to God Amen how didn the Baptist John the Baptist his head was cut off Hallelujah [Applause] his head was cut off they cut off his head and they put it on a platter yet he was the elij of that time all rightall and then he said because he was preaching wrong what is wrong doctr he began talking about the serpent seat I can preach the serpent seed without even mentioning the name John preaches serpent seed Paul preached serpent seed we know from the Bible that Kan was not a son of Adam I want Apostle Grace I can go to him by to prove to me from the Bible that was a son of nowhere nowhere in the genealogies of Adam nowhere the Bible says Enoch was the seventh from Adam and you've not counted Cain youve not counted the Bible says sa repl AB so you begin counting from Adam to Kan was not counted why because the Bible says in the book of First John was a son of sat hallu write in your Bible they are blinded and by missing the ministry of Elijah they will miss the Rapture why because they can't understand the Min of Elijah in the end time is coming to prepare the bride for the Rapture it is coming to introduce the bride to the bridegroom Jesus Christ this ain't about church this is not about our our pastor that's why a true message church does not lift up a pastor the word our pastor is the Bible and the Holy Ghost and any man will stand behind the Bible and the word that one we will follow Paul said follow me as I follow Christ we are not here to follow even to follow William if William preaches anything that is not in the Bible we shall not believe it but I want to tell you until today I have not seen any doctr of William BR that is not in the Bible it is right here in the Bible every man of God every servant for him to prove that is of god he cannot teach something different from the Bible is our ABS hallelujah hallelujah praise God I say El is El is the devil can't stop they are too late to stop it they waited until William Bram died and then they began saying some people prophesied some prophesy a prophecy doesn't come after it has happened I wish this people would do some research no man would dare give such prophecies when he was the man was alive praise God what William Bram had was not a gift only it was a Ministry Elijah didn't have just a gift he had a Min are you following me the word of God doesn't come to an apostle it comes to a prophet that is the way read Amos 3:17 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he will reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets and I'm I am happy I can identify myself with theer Ministry in our en there are many prophets in the Old Testament the spirit and the Min of elah were was however very special it was very special elah came in at the time when Israel was back the glory of God had departed I believe you can say that the glory of God departed from the religious World they Bast of success how many people they have and how good the buildings are which is okay but that's not a measure of level of success a measure of success true me of success is when how many people you've brought to Christ not to your denomination but to Christ not to your church but you've brought them to know Christ that's how you measure your success Min even if I preached 2s and one got saved I would consider myself as a successful preacher if our church here our fellowship here if only two can go in the Rapture one I will consider myself as having a successful Min if only one or two receive the Holy Ghost sincerely in their souls and walk the Life of Christ and walk the talk then we have a successful but at that time Israel had Backle the glory of God and King was one of the problems he had mared from among the Heen women that's why a Believer should never Mar unbeliever I Married An unbeliever she brought an unbeliever and when that happened jeel the woman she misled and they builts which were not the Alters of Jehovah God but they were Alters of other and Jezebel died died Elijah was there but these people the spirits of them that were on them is here again the spirit of Ahab is here in the denominations that don't accept the right teachings of toled Jezebel the spirit of jeel the spirit of Jezebel the woman Spirit which the chch spirit a woman is a type of a church Spirit which will pull them away from the word my pastor said it doesn't matter how I dress sister it matters how you dress [Applause] it matters how you dress it is woman this woman je how that she was painting herself and we see the Same Spirit today women are on the pulpits and they like jeel to begin with it was not the place of jeze to be a preacher in Israel God had not called a woman Prophet to be a preacher in Israel there where Prophet says like Prophet doas Prophet doas was not going around in the temple teaching prophets instructing Kings Prophet doas she would sit at her home under a pal tree and anybody who wanted to inquire of the Lord would go to her home but the prophetes so of today are not prophetes like doers they are not Servants of God like prisilla but we see the spirit of Jezebel behind him Jezebel who was instructing the king intoxicating the king and the King believed wrong Doctrine Jezebel made herself a pastor of Israel even when there was a true prophet of God true prophet of God called Elijah overed because she had the influence of the king and she was so big and this woman would paint us and go to the window and she wanted men to look at her sister if you tell me you are using me but your desire is not to be seen by men you are lying let me prove that to you do that makeup and remain in your bedroom you cannot because you want to do makeup so that you can attract those men you don't many women don't do it intentionally it is a spirit of the age of jeel and even the pastors they already Intoxicated by this Spirit they tell the young ladies please make up look beautiful look attractive so you can get me to marri I'm sorry the men that will marry you will be like I the brother but as far as I'm concerned Brothers Are Holy Ghost f are not going toel painted Jezebel and even Believers of the message who don't believe in makeup on the wedding day they make makeup oh my God is so on your wedding day you are saying it is my day I can carry some little Jezebel if it is not good for you today it is not good for you any day stand for the world I'm telling you young people who are going to get married you are warming up we don't want those Jezebel stuff for God yes I'm telling you because we did not do use makeup on our and we didn't die and we preached Christ by our action the people who came we are not the same like them we are different the Bible says we are royal priesthood we are things and PR they are different cannot be the same like let us show the world there is a better life to you that I in institutions I understand my sister here you are in an aviation institution and I know makeup is one of the things that is almost required my sister God has sent you there testimony show them there are a different group of people who don't believe in this stuff and who will not die yes you can even go to the courts of law yes if it came to that stand for the word where are those people going to be zealous having the Zeal of the work the Zeal of Truth the Zeal of Holiness the Zeal of righteous when everybody else around you is doing something else and you are different sister you keep your hair long trim your hair because the Bible says your hair is given you for your glory and if you are not covered the Bible doesn't even allow you to pray and the Bible says your hair is your covering and you can't even pray if you are not covered you mean women should not cut hair [Applause] evening know this you mean you believe that no the Bible says I don't tell you what I believe I tell you what the Bible says read the Bible the B talks about Samson say Samson what was he Samson had a vow and that vow did not allow him to cut even to put a Las on his nothing because he had a vow with God and that's where the source of his power was coming in the New Testament the Bible says the woman they have power on their head for the reason of their long hair their uncut hair long I want to be long well not against your nature you not a white woman who you are appreciate who you are if you don't have very long hair just don't cut your hair make it look nice in it natural form keep it the way God would like you to keep yourself neat and nice look beautiful the way of the Believers when we preach these things it doesn't mean sister just I'm not going to come I'm not going to wash my hair I'm a believer I'm not even going to dress proper even the clo I dress sweeping the floor because I'm a Believer no don't overdo it do it the right way if you many of the people who do that they doing it as a law but do it by Revelation dress nice look nice if you don't if you dress badly you know if you are that kind of woman who always will not see you will be there why don't you marry I don't see Sisters yet they are here but they are they are not seeable sisters look nice but not sexy okay that kind of language appears to our younger generation you know these days they dress to impress they dress to be sex they not a sexual object you are as a daughter of God you are not to be looked at men to last after you let ay look at you and say I see the character of in this younger sister so much that he can't even sleep until he comes to the pastor when I looked at sister forunate forunate I can't even sleep help me Pastor what can I do because when I see her I see the character of the way she talks the way she beh the way she dresses the way she does a see Jesus Christ but if you want to be the kind that men look at you and they're like both of you have committed fornication and the Bible says already that was for free for our young people that woman Jezebel that woman jeze and in Revelation 2:20 not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou suffer that woman Jezebel which call herself a prophetes to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols the spirit of Jezebel is a spirit of fornication and physically speaking most women are like this in generation the things they do it is for that purpose this is for our young people I'll give you this testimony one time ethopia you know I I've been raised to to leave the word I know there are certain things I can't do like you cannot find me in one room closed up with one sister I can't do that even if I'm a pastor I will keep that order I not do that oh you don't trust yourself well I don't trust the devil are you hearing me I don't trust the devil and here in Ethiopia I was in um you know this this sister that came she was a new believer but I noticed I was even speaking to my wife this sister she has a certain speed on her we need to pray for her and so one time she calls me up and you know she tried her best to meet me alone I was like what is going on so there must be something so I of course I was watching for that but not wanting to be rude and so what I did I was always keeping a distance and always meeting her with my wife close by she needed any c but you know she was a new believer and then one time she calls me up I don't remember what time it was it was uh maybe my wife can remember was it midnight or midnight after midnight after midnight [Music] condition so touching I feel this is real is genuine I need to go rescue her so I I called up a brother I had a brother in my house who is now the pastor of the church I called him up I said brotherus let's go could you please help me let's go and we meet this sister she just called me now she she's in distress help so we drove and then when we arrived there she came and you know found on on the road like jeel and then she sat in the chair in the front of the chair and when she sat she noticed there was brother morgus and she became very angry why did you come with him I had my problems I tell you I just kept quiet and I observed the situation and then she noticed I was just calm and it was just an embarrassment so she calmed down she started telling me issues it wasn't a great deal in 5 minutes we drove her back and went home now you who thinks you spiritual more than even your P you know may I can even you know share a room with a sister brother you are not more spiritual than the word the Bible says don't accompany with fornicators don't even eat with them are you hearing me but he said not all together the forat but those ones are called brother or sister and going around forting around those ones they should be marked unless they repent shouldn't fellowship with them it is scripture so brother there are certain sins which you can avoid and others you can't avoid for example you can't avoid fornication if you go the enem come a man of godon anointed having a heart like that but when he went into that camp when he saw the first time he looked away help said this is too much call me the next thing you realize he had fallen from gra talk about Samson a man of God power powerful he sits down and on on the sleeps on the laps of and you know begin while he was on the thighs of I'm powerful you know you know I'm anointed you know I can kill yes that's why I TR yes tell me where is your no I will not tell you so you don't love and in that process slowly by slowly Samson was losing his strength Samson was losing his strength his strength spiritual strength his secret our secret is the let people ask you what is your secret of Holiness what is your secret of strength our secret is the word because we are hiding ourselves in the word we have escaped fornication we have escaped both physical and spiritual hide yourself in the word yourself in
