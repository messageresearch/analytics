[30:11] right now?
[30:13] I have a testimony to share with you.
[30:17] Uh when I went back to to the room by
[30:20] you know my wife just had a baby. We
[30:21] just had a baby
[30:25] and uh so uh she's just more or less
[30:30] staying in the room.
[30:33] And so when I I went there, she shared a
[30:35] testimony with me.
[30:39] We have a brother in the church.
[30:42] His name is Brother Brian.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; And this brother
[30:46] together with his wife
[30:49] for now a few years.
[30:52] They've been having, you know, children
[30:54] and losing them
[30:58] during child birth.
[31:00] And so this brother came this night
[31:06] to the camp
[31:08] and and um you know he was because he
[31:11] was a little late he was turned away by
[31:15] you know pastor Maher preached and he
[31:17] said this is the place of our anointing
[31:23] and so well but they had stepped already
[31:25] here
[31:27] and so they were turned away
[31:30] But after stepping here
[31:33] and so as soon as they were turned away,
[31:37] they went and had their baby.
[31:42] Hallelujah.
[31:44] Amen.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; And so successful child birth.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And praise the Lord.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[31:58] here to be anointed for the sister to be
[32:00] anointed for the child birth then where
[32:06] and so uh when I checked the brother I
[32:08] found a text he said pastor

[32:20] So whatever your problem is this is the
[32:23] PLACE OF YOUR ANOINTING.

[32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. you know after he ministers this
[32:57] come
[32:59] you know I'm sending him to Nairobi
[33:03] and now I'm beginning to feel jealousy
[33:06] because
[33:08] brother Tasha was there for a few weeks
[33:11] and now he came here they sent him to us
[33:13] almost used up
[33:17] but anyways now pastor Michael
[33:21] is going to Nairobi also
[33:23] after is meeting.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know the Nairobi team, you're
[33:28] very happy
[33:30] and so but I thought we should stay with
[33:32] you for a little longer.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; You know these chairs here then
[33:40] they've been mostly free. If the deacons
[33:42] can get the those of the Kenyan team,
[33:44] you paid a lot to be here. If you can
[33:45] come here this side,
[33:49] this chair should not be free.
[33:52] Yeah, the deacons can help help me and
[33:54] get
[33:58] if you came from Nairobi,
[34:01] come and tap the anointing.
[34:04] And if you're a Ugandan and a Kenyan
[34:06] comes, just
[34:09] step back.
[34:11] Step back in a good spirit.
[34:15] Amen. If a Uganda and a Kenyan comes,
[34:21] please step back in.
[34:24] Praise the Lord. There are more coming.
[34:27] So, I don't know if there are more
[34:28] chairs.

[34:39] And I think we have one or two or three
[34:41] more.
[34:44] Okay. Praise the Lord.
[34:46] And I think I love this song.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; It's a very good theme for these
[34:49] meetings.
[34:51] So we're going to sing it again. As
[34:53] pastor Mike, you have all the time.

[34:59] if you want to preach one hour, two
[35:00] hours.

[35:25] I want to think that also as much as
[35:27] there are issues here at the venue but I
[35:28] think that that has also affected
[35:34] and so our streaming I don't know if it
[35:36] has been restored but hasn't been there
[35:40] what's your need
[35:42] what's your cry what's your mountain
[35:46] speak the word by and by the mountain
[35:50] will move
[35:52] if it doesn't move
[35:54] you to fly.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Watch your knees.
[36:04] Watch your
[36:07] &gt;&gt; in a higher place.
[36:12] Do not struggle.
[36:17] is by grace.
[36:21] Set your wings
[36:25] to the wings of faith.
[36:30] Set your wings
[36:34] to the wings of faith.
[36:40] You can fly
[36:44] in a higher
[36:49] Do not struggle.
[36:54] It's my praise.
[36:58] Set your wings
[37:02] to wind.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Let the weak say I am strong.
[37:14] And let the poor say I am free.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Let the voice say.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; It's what the Lord has done for me.
[37:39] Ohana
[37:56] Jesus
[38:01] Hana
[38:22] Jesus
[38:28] into I
[38:37] s
[38:40] away
[38:42] from my
[38:47] free
[38:52] love.
[38:59] Heat. Heat.
[39:09] Hosanana
[39:15] Jesusana
[39:28] to the lamb
[39:32] that was slain.
[39:36] Hana
[39:43] Jesus died
[39:46] and rose again.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord somebody.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[39:55] Praise God.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:01] Merciful Jesus. Amen. I would like to
[40:04] greet you all in the name of our Lord
[40:06] and Savior Jesus Christ.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Certainly
[40:13] deem it a grand private
[40:23] a privilege to be here this morning.
[40:30] And I'll start by appreciating by
[40:32] appreciating all of you.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[40:38] Because a convention is not a convention
[40:43] convention
[40:44] &gt;&gt; without your presence,
[40:46] &gt;&gt; without your prayers,
[40:48] &gt;&gt; without your sacrifices
[40:51] with without you. Each one coming with
[40:53] your own leak of fire
[40:59] so that we can create this atmosphere.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, don't wait for
[41:05] anything.
[41:09] Just when you feel like it, just receive
[41:12] your blessing.
[41:15] If you have a burden, just put it down.
[41:19] This is that atmosphere where in all
[41:21] things are possible.
[41:24] Don't wait until you feel like there's
[41:26] water that's been poured on you
[41:30] or maybe you start to feel like you're
[41:32] having goosebumps.
[41:36] just have a blessed assurance that the
[41:37] presence of the Lord is here.
[41:42] And take advantage of his presence.
[41:46] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to appreciate uh brother
[41:49] Bas. I don't know if that's what you
[41:51] call him here. We prefer to call him
[41:52] that.
[41:57] Pastor Talma.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Uh our host.
[42:04] Our host. he's hosting
[42:07] and certainly appreciate his invitation
[42:09] to come.
[42:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. And I want to
[42:15] appreciate all the ministering brothers
[42:17] and all the pastors.
[42:22] I'll pay a special salute to my fellow
[42:24] speakers, Brother Josh Walker.
[42:39] I know the concept of time and distance
[42:42] in Australia is a bit strange sometimes.
[42:45] Me and brother Josh though we are coming
[42:48] from the same country but we are about 4
[42:50] and a half hours 5 hours apart by
[42:53] flight.
[42:59] So
[43:03] he's right on the eastern coast
[43:07] of the Australian continent
[43:11] and I'm right on the western tip
[43:16] of the of the Australian continent.
[43:21] And I'm sure you can tell from my accent
[43:26] that I was not born and raised there.
[43:32] I'm not saying amen.
[43:39] I was born and raised in Zimbabwe.
[43:44] Zimbabwe. Amen. Amen. And we share the
[43:47] same kind of spiritual upbringing with
[43:49] Rev Te.
[43:56] When I look in there,
[43:58] when I look in the audience
[44:01] &gt;&gt; and I see all the black hair and brown
[44:04] brown eyes,
[44:10] I'm home. I'm home.
[44:19] Praise the Lord. I'm Even when I landed
[44:21] in Johannesburg,
[44:25] &gt;&gt; just setting foot on the African
[44:26] continent,
[44:30] &gt;&gt; I felt like home.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then uh day before yesterday I
[44:37] uh obviously for security reasons there
[44:39] was a bit of a concern but we wanted to
[44:42] just go into campala
[44:51] and brother Martin and brother Joshua
[44:53] made that possible
[44:55] brother brother Martin and brother
[44:57] Joshua made it possible.
[45:03] So we took a walk around the city
[45:07] and went into the underbelly of the
[45:09] city.
[45:12] I felt like I was at home.
[45:15] So my mother's tongue being sha.
[45:21] It's a banto language.
[45:24] So I can't understand what you're
[45:26] saying,
[45:29] but I can connect to what you are
[45:30] saying.
[45:37] because all these
[45:40] and all these languages are all very
[45:41] closely related.
[45:48] Praise the Lord. So I just want you to
[45:50] know that I'm home.
[45:54] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; But uh having said that, I will go
[46:00] straight into the word.
[46:03] How many are under expectation?
[46:06] Amen. We
[46:09] the Lord doing something for us.
[46:13] So we are not leaving the book of Luke.
[46:17] Let us revisit the book of Luke
[46:20] chapter 10.
[46:23] Praise the Lord. Luke chapter 10
[46:27] and we start from verse 17.
[46:31] Amen. Amen.
[46:44] So, I forgot to mention that I took
[46:46] brother Josh with us when we went into
[46:47] town.
[46:55] We went with our brother to the markets
[46:57] and up and down.
[47:03] Amen.
[47:04] And I bought uh
[47:10] you know the thickened mold so mold
[47:12] drinker.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; I bought some busher.
[47:20] I tried to offer my brother but he was
[47:22] like I think you
[47:25] you are kind of pushing it now.
[47:33] Praise the Lord.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; But I was happy to have it
[47:40] because on the south in
[47:55] I was more than happy to have it.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke 10 verse 17.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible reads, "Let's just bow our
[48:12] heads for a word of prayer.
[48:14] Lord Jesus, we are here in your presence
[48:19] and any educated man can read the word.
[48:24] But it takes the action of the spirit
[48:28] to interpret the word
[48:30] and to breathe life into it
[48:33] that it may go and enter the hearts of
[48:35] men.
[48:40] And Lord, you've always used mankind.
[48:45] as men can be,
[48:49] unworthy as men can be,
[48:52] yet you have chosen to use
[48:56] men for the preaching of the gospel.
[49:00] And so we come and stand.
[49:25] Everyone that is in divine presence,
[49:29] let everything be done
[49:34] &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[49:36] Christ.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Luke 10:1 17 the Bible reads,
[49:46] "I saluted the ministers before brother
[49:48] Gideon walked in. God bless you my
[49:50] brother.
[49:56] And the seven returned again with joy,
[49:59] saying, Lord, even the devils are
[50:02] subject unto us through thy name.
[50:14] And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as
[50:18] lightning fall from heaven.
[50:26] Behold, I give unto you power to tread
[50:29] on serpents and scorpions, and over all
[50:32] the power of the enemy,
[50:35] and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[50:48] Not withstanding in this, rejoice not
[50:52] that the spirits are subject unto you,
[50:55] but rather rejoice because your names
[50:58] are written in heaven.
[51:09] In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit
[51:12] and said, I thank thee, oh father, Lord
[51:15] of heaven and earth, that thou has hid
[51:18] these things from the wise and prudent
[51:21] and has revealed them unto babes. Even
[51:24] so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy
[51:28] sight.
[51:48] Praise the Lord.
[51:51] Amen. All things are delivered to me of
[51:53] my father. And no man knoweth who the
[51:57] son is but the father and who the father
[52:00] is but the son and he to whom the son
[52:05] will reveal him.
[52:18] And he turned unto his disciples and
[52:20] said privately, "Blessed are the eyes
[52:24] which see the things that you see. For I
[52:27] tell you that many prophets and kings
[52:30] have desired to see those things which
[52:32] you see, and have not seen them, and to
[52:36] hear those things which he hear, and
[52:38] have not heard them.
[52:58] Praise the Lord.
[53:01] The grass witherth, the flower fade it,
[53:04] but the word of our God shall stand
[53:06] forever.
[53:13] Praise the Lord.
[53:15] If they would like to give a title to my
[53:18] sermon this
[53:20] morning,
[53:23] I would like to entitle it the bride's
[53:26] revival
[53:31] is perfect realization.
[53:36] The bride's revival is perfect
[53:39] realization.
[53:44] I'm trying to continue with the subject
[53:46] from yesterday
[53:50] because it's all connected.
[53:54] Praise the Lord.
[53:56] It will be a blessing to you all
[54:00] and I am quite aware that there may be
[54:03] different views,
[54:08] different perspectives to the word.
[54:13] And sometimes between ministers there's
[54:15] different areas of emphasis.
[54:23] Now I'm not going to travel all these
[54:26] hours to come into Uganda and cause
[54:28] controversy.
[54:37] Neither am I going to enter into a
[54:40] delusion to think I know better than any
[54:42] one of your ministers.
[54:51] Because I know they are able.
[54:55] But I just want to come and present the
[54:56] word
[54:59] and I pray that the Holy Spirit will
[55:01] water the words to the hearts of the
[55:02] people
[55:06] and my prayers.
[55:08] My presence here and my ministering is a
[55:11] blessing.
[55:15] I say anything contrary to your pastor.
[55:20] Amen. And you have confidence in your
[55:21] pastor.
[55:25] Stay with your pastor's teaching.
[55:28] But if what I'm saying is the word,
[55:32] not another man's opinion,
[55:36] you receive the word
[55:38] and say amen to the word.
[55:42] Amen. And so we were speaking yesterday
[55:45] about the realization of the
[55:47] relationship.
[55:52] I could have continued on from there,
[55:56] but but then the pastor came and
[55:59] continued off from where I left
[56:04] and he's read the quote that I was going
[56:06] to read. Had I continued a minute
[56:08] further, a minute further,
[56:16] I saw the spirit of the Lord moving.
[56:20] Praise the Lord. And I took a peek at
[56:23] brother Tinash's notes.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; You don't know how happy I was to see
[56:32] that I taken his
[56:39] praise the Lord. But he doesn't know
[56:41] he's in for it again today.
[56:46] But oh, it's a pleasure when you have a
[56:48] convention.
[56:52] and you are so far apart
[56:55] and you've not compared notes or
[56:57] discussed
[57:00] but the spirit of the lord drops
[57:01] inspiration in each one of you
[57:06] and the inspiration connects
[57:10] not the work of a man
[57:12] it's the thought of god he wants to give
[57:14] us
[57:16] praise the lord the prophet in the
[57:18] message
[57:22] He says on paragraph 48,
[57:25] &gt;&gt; he says, "I think the church has been
[57:27] preached to death."
[57:34] The thing it needs now is come back to
[57:37] teaching
[57:40] and get them on a foundation
[57:45] so you know how to build yourself up in
[57:48] Christ.
[57:52] And we've built churches upon sensations
[57:58] and upon different things,
[58:01] but we can't build upon nothing but
[58:04] Christ.
[58:07] The revelation of Jesus Christ,
[58:12] that's the only thing that we can do.
[58:17] In him you are complete.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Without him you are lost.
[58:26] There's not a way in the way in the
[58:29] world for you to be saved.
[58:34] So the prophet is showing there
[58:37] that there's need for the church
[58:41] to be set on a firm foundation
[58:45] and that firm foundation
[58:48] is to bring a teaching
[58:52] upon the church
[58:55] that will stabilize them
[58:58] and help them grow and build themselves
[59:01] up in Christ.
[59:06] Because teaching reveals who you are
[59:09] positionally
[59:13] re it is that revelation
[59:16] that puts you on a solid foundation
[59:21] to then build yourself up
[59:25] in Jesus Christ.
[59:27] Are we together? Exposition of the seven
[59:30] church ages.
[59:32] That was the sign of the inddwelling
[59:39] in the days of Paul.
[59:42] Those who were filled with the Holy
[59:44] Ghost heard the word
[59:49] received it
[59:51] and lived by it.
[59:55] Those who did not have the spirit
[59:59] had it only as cannal man
[1:00:05] put a wrong interpretation to it
[1:00:10] went into sin
[1:00:13] in every age
[1:00:16] and every age is the age of the Holy
[1:00:18] Ghost for the true believer
[1:00:24] In every age, the evidence was the same.
[1:00:30] Those
[1:00:31] who had the spirit,
[1:00:35] the teacher,
[1:00:38] heard the word,
[1:00:41] and that spirit in them,
[1:00:46] took the word,
[1:00:49] and taught it,
[1:00:52] revealed it to them,
[1:00:56] and they were of the group that heard
[1:00:59] the messenger
[1:01:03] and his message
[1:01:06] and took it
[1:01:08] and it
[1:01:11] so you can hear the word.
[1:01:15] You can parrot the word.
[1:01:19] You can have the quotes and the verses.
[1:01:24] You can be in a message church
[1:01:28] and you can know the doctrine,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; but you may lack the anction to live and
[1:01:34] express the word.
[1:01:43] hearing the word as can man
[1:01:47] and as a can of man.
[1:01:51] Remember spiritual things are
[1:01:53] spiritually discerned
[1:01:58] and discerning is not looking.
[1:02:02] Discerning is deeper than looking.
[1:02:06] Discerning is having insight.
[1:02:11] When we
[1:02:15] is not connecting that verse, this verse
[1:02:17] and that verse,
[1:02:21] BUT IS TO GO TO THE MIND OF THE COMPOSER
[1:02:27] AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT AND WHAT HE
[1:02:30] SAID.
[1:02:34] THEREFORE, you are able to live beyond
[1:02:36] the dos and don'ts.
[1:02:41] AND YOU ARE able to express that which
[1:02:43] is written.
[1:02:47] That is only possible
[1:02:50] to the people who have the spirit
[1:02:54] because they hear the word
[1:02:57] and the spirit in them
[1:03:00] teaches them the word that they've
[1:03:03] heard.
[1:03:06] as the spirit teaches them,
[1:03:09] then they are ABLE TO BUILD THEMSELVES
[1:03:11] UP
[1:03:13] to the stature of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; So there's a growth there
[1:03:22] even when you have the baptism of the
[1:03:24] Holy Ghost.
[1:03:27] HE HAS PROMISED US
[1:03:29] TO SEND US THE spirit of truth
[1:03:33] TO GUIDE US
[1:03:35] INTO all the truth.
[1:03:38] Are we together?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; And what is the truth?
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; It is the truth of his word.
[1:03:46] Hallelujah. IT IS THE WALK OF ENOCH.
[1:03:49] FOR ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD.
[1:03:53] ENOCH WAS IN MOTION.
[1:03:56] ENOCH WAS MOVING.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; There was a moving a progression
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; and ENOCH PROGRESSED
[1:04:05] UNTIL WE REACHED A POINT
[1:04:08] WHERE HE WAS NO MORE.
[1:04:10] ARE WE TOGETHER? THE PROPHET SAYS THE
[1:04:14] BIBLE CONDENSES ITS TRUTH.
[1:04:19] SO IT'S A SIMPLE LINE, A SIMPLE
[1:04:21] STATEMENT,
[1:04:23] but it is a lot of truth that HAS BEEN
[1:04:25] CONDENSED INTO that line.
[1:04:30] AND IT TAKES A PROPHETIC CLASS OF people
[1:04:36] under an ego ANOINTING
[1:04:39] to decompress.
[1:04:42] WHAT HAS BEEN COMPRESSED
[1:04:45] AND CONDENSED
[1:04:47] BY THE SPIRIT.
[1:04:49] And they see that when THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:04:52] ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD,
[1:04:56] that statement means something.
[1:05:00] IT WAS EXPERIENCE UPON EXPERIENCE.
[1:05:03] IT WAS EXPERIENCE UPON EXPERIENCE.
[1:05:07] It was revelation upon revelation.
[1:05:10] AND he was growing IN GRACE,
[1:05:14] IN HIS UNDERSTANDING
[1:05:16] OF WHO HE WAS. IT WAS A GROWTH IN HIS
[1:05:20] RELATIONSHIP
[1:05:22] WITH GOD.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. And so we are promised
[1:05:27] the same spirit
[1:05:30] that the overcomers
[1:05:32] will have that spirit.
[1:05:35] THEY WILL RECEIVE THE WORD AND the
[1:05:38] spirit in them
[1:05:40] will teach that word to them
[1:05:43] AND THEY WILL GROW
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; AND BE ABLE TO LIVE IT
[1:05:48] AND EXPRESS IT.
[1:05:51] AMEN.
[1:05:53] AMEN.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:56] And the Lord Jesus Christ according to
[1:05:58] the portion of scripture that we read
[1:06:03] have power
[1:06:05] They are able to cast out demons.
[1:06:08] They are able to pray for the sick
[1:06:12] and the sick can recover.
[1:06:14] They see so many miracles.
[1:06:18] Humanly speaking,
[1:06:20] it is something to rejoice about.
[1:06:24] When you can talk to devils
[1:06:27] and devils say yes, we are going.
[1:06:31] and there's sickness there and you pray
[1:06:35] or you speak the word and sickness goes.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; It is certainly something to rejoice
[1:06:41] over
[1:06:43] and their testimony was true
[1:06:46] because the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:49] did not did not dispute what they were
[1:06:51] saying
[1:06:53] because he said to them, I beheld Satan
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; as lightning fall from heaven.
[1:07:02] It was true their testimony.
[1:07:06] But everything being said and done,
[1:07:09] he said to them, "But I'd rather you
[1:07:11] rejoice
[1:07:14] that because your names
[1:07:17] are written in heaven."
[1:07:20] Hallelujah. ALL THESE OTHER
[1:07:22] MANIFESTATIONS ARE GOOD.
[1:07:26] rather rejoice
[1:07:28] to know OR TO CATCH THE REVELATION
[1:07:32] THAT your names are written in heaven.
[1:07:36] Oh hallelujah. Amen. And the Bible says
[1:07:39] in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit
[1:07:44] and said, "I thank thee, oh father, Lord
[1:07:46] of heaven and earth,
[1:07:51] that thou has hid these things
[1:07:55] from the wise and prudent,
[1:07:58] and he has revealed them
[1:08:01] unto babes,
[1:08:03] even so, Father, for so it seemed good
[1:08:06] in thy sight.
[1:08:09] Hallelujah. And he goes on to say that
[1:08:11] no one knows the father.
[1:08:15] No one knows who the son is
[1:08:18] but the father.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; And who the father is
[1:08:24] but the son.
[1:08:26] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; No one knows the son
[1:08:33] but the father
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; and the son.
[1:08:37] Amen. And then he says, comma,
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; amen. And he to whom the son will reveal
[1:08:45] him.
[1:08:49] Hallelujah. Amen. In verse 23
[1:08:53] then says
[1:08:55] and he turned him unto his disciples
[1:09:00] and said privately
[1:09:04] BLESSED ARE THE EYES WHICH see
[1:09:09] that you see.
[1:09:11] SO THERE WAS A PUBLIC MINISTRY
[1:09:14] and there WAS A P PRIVATE MINISTRY
[1:09:18] AND NO ONE KNOWS THE FATHER
[1:09:22] BUT THE SON AND NO ONE KNOWS THE SON
[1:09:27] BUT THE FATHER.
[1:09:28] HALLELUJAH. AND NO ONE KNOWS THE SON BUT
[1:09:32] the one to whom the son reveals to.
[1:09:36] Are we together? SO YOU WILL NOT KNOW
[1:09:39] THE FATHER.
[1:09:41] NEITHER WILL YOU KNOW THE SON
[1:09:44] UNLESS THE SON REVEALS HIMSELF TO YOU.
[1:09:49] YOU CAN HEAR ABOUT HIM,
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU may not know him.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so he reveals these
[1:09:59] things
[1:10:01] to his disciples
[1:10:04] privately.
[1:10:06] Mark chapter 4
[1:10:08] verse 10 the Bible reads
[1:10:17] Don't worry I'll wait for you to open
[1:10:18] your Bibles
[1:10:22] some of you I don't know when you last
[1:10:24] read your Bibles so
[1:10:29] we might as well wait for each other
[1:10:30] here
[1:10:34] the book of Mark chapter four and we
[1:10:37] start from verse 10.
[1:10:47] No cheating. No cheating. You know
[1:10:48] sometimes when people are stuck to get
[1:10:50] to the verse and it gets embarrassing
[1:10:52] because they keep searching and
[1:10:53] searching. They don't want to be seen
[1:10:55] that they are lost. They just open a
[1:10:57] certain page
[1:11:02] and pretend like
[1:11:06] in the right portion,
[1:11:12] but we're not expecting that.
[1:11:15] The Bible reads verse 10.
[1:11:18] And when he was alone, they that were
[1:11:21] about him with the 12 asked of him the
[1:11:24] parable.
[1:11:35] And he said unto them, "Unto you it is
[1:11:37] given to know the mystery of the kingdom
[1:11:41] of God.
[1:11:47] But unto them that are without, all
[1:11:50] these things are done in parables.
[1:12:00] that seeing they may see and perceive
[1:12:03] not, and hearing they may hear and not
[1:12:07] understand, lest at any time they should
[1:12:10] be converted, and their sins should be
[1:12:13] forgiven them.
[1:12:26] Forgiveness
[1:12:28] is linked to the revelation.
[1:12:32] So you if you catch the revelation
[1:12:35] then you can be righteous
[1:12:38] because your righteousness is connected
[1:12:40] to your revelation.
[1:12:46] cannot receive h righteousness
[1:12:50] is for them to not receive revelation.
[1:12:57] If they receive revelation
[1:13:01] entitled to forgiveness,
[1:13:04] they are entitled to every blessing.
[1:13:08] So he spoke unto them in parables
[1:13:13] because he did not want them to
[1:13:15] understand and have revelation.
[1:13:19] But if we read from verse 33 of the same
[1:13:21] chapter,
[1:13:24] the Bible reads, "And with many such
[1:13:26] parables spake he the word unto them as
[1:13:30] they were able to hear it.
[1:13:40] but without a parable spake he not unto
[1:13:43] them.
[1:13:48] And when they were alone,
[1:13:53] he expounded all things to his disciples
[1:14:00] publicly. He's speaking in parables.
[1:14:04] are able to hear it
[1:14:07] but they cannot understand it
[1:14:10] but privately to his churches
[1:14:13] then he expounds all things
[1:14:20] Luke chapter 24 how many love to read
[1:14:22] their Bibles
[1:14:26] I trust that you are happy to read your
[1:14:28] Bible
[1:14:31] Luke chapter 24
[1:14:34] starting from verse 27.
[1:14:37] The Lord Jesus Christ has been
[1:14:39] crucified.
[1:14:42] He has died a violent death
[1:14:46] under capital punishment of the Roman
[1:14:49] authority
[1:14:53] that was governing over Judea at that
[1:14:56] time.
[1:14:59] And the disciples are disappointed.
[1:15:05] They are despondent,
[1:15:08] discouraged,
[1:15:11] confused
[1:15:13] because they could not understand the
[1:15:15] season that they were in.
[1:15:18] And as they are talking about these
[1:15:20] things,
[1:15:23] and his friend on the way to Amos
[1:15:29] As they are talking about these things,
[1:15:32] the Lord joins with them after his
[1:15:35] resurrection.
[1:15:38] And the Bible starts now in verse 27
[1:15:43] and says, "And beginning at Moses
[1:15:47] and all the prophets,
[1:15:50] HE EXPOUNDED UNTO them in all the
[1:15:53] scriptures that things concerning
[1:15:56] himself."
[1:16:02] That's teaching. Now
[1:16:05] he is establishing them.
[1:16:08] on the reality of the gospel
[1:16:11] to bring a revelation upon them
[1:16:15] that what has happened is not a loss.
[1:16:20] It is a fulfillment of scripture
[1:16:24] all THE WAY FROM THE BOOKS OF Moses
[1:16:28] to the prophets.
[1:16:30] He is expounding to them the scriptures
[1:16:34] so that they understand
[1:16:37] the season that they are in
[1:16:40] but they see it they did not see it.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO TEACHING CAN TAKE PLACE
[1:16:50] teaching for that matter
[1:16:53] right teaching the correct
[1:16:56] people can sit under a teaching ministry
[1:17:01] the WORD CORRECTLY EXPOUNDED TO them
[1:17:06] and still still not have revelation
[1:17:11] BECAUSE THEY WALKED A WHOLE JOURNEY
[1:17:15] AND HE WAS EXPOUNDING TO THEM from Moses
[1:17:18] the prophet
[1:17:21] the scriptures
[1:17:23] but they didn't see it
[1:17:26] and they drew nigh unto the village
[1:17:28] wheither they went
[1:17:31] and he made as though he would have gone
[1:17:33] further
[1:17:36] and they constrained him saying
[1:17:41] abide with us for it is toward towards
[1:17:43] evening
[1:17:46] and the day is far spent and he went in
[1:17:49] to tell with them
[1:17:54] and it came to pass as he sat at meat
[1:17:56] with them.
[1:18:00] He took bread
[1:18:02] and blessed it
[1:18:05] to break
[1:18:07] and gave to them
[1:18:09] and their EYES WERE OPEN.
[1:18:14] AND THEY KNEW him
[1:18:17] and he vanished OUT OF THEIR SIGHT.
[1:18:20] IT TOOK A SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT,
[1:18:24] NOT JUST TEACHING
[1:18:27] BUT A SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT
[1:18:30] that they could identify.
[1:18:34] No one else
[1:18:37] can BREAK BREAD
[1:18:40] THE WAY THAT BREAD HAS BEEN BROKEN.
[1:18:44] THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE
[1:18:46] THERE IS ONLY ONE
[1:18:49] THAT CAN BREAK BREAD
[1:18:52] THE WAY IT'S BEEN BROKEN.
[1:18:55] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THEY HAD SEEN HIM
[1:18:58] BREAK BREAD BEFORE.
[1:19:01] THEY HAD WITNESSED
[1:19:03] THE BREAKING OF BREAD
[1:19:06] AND IT WAS MIRACULOUS.
[1:19:09] ONLY HIM COULD BREAK BREAD LIKE THAT.
[1:19:14] AND WHEN THEY LOOKED AND SAW HIM BREAK
[1:19:18] BREAD AGAIN
[1:19:20] THE SAME WAY
[1:19:22] THAT HE HAD DONE BEFORE. THEY SAID NO
[1:19:26] MAN CAN DO THIS.
[1:19:31] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. IT CAN ONLY BE HIM.
[1:19:35] WE HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE
[1:19:37] AND IT IS ONLY HIM.
[1:19:40] BREAK IT LIKE THAT.
[1:19:43] THEN THEIR EYES WERE OPEN
[1:19:46] AND THEY KNEW HIM.
[1:19:49] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WE COULD TEACH THIS
[1:19:51] AFTERNOON.
[1:19:53] IF HE DOESN'T COME AND BREAK IT TO YOU
[1:19:57] THE WAY HE ONLY CAN BREAK IT,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE HIM.
[1:20:05] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:20:10] AMEN.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY ONE
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; THAT CAN BREAK IT
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; WITH CREATIVE POWER.
[1:20:22] AMEN.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THEY SAW IT
[1:20:37] AND KNEW HIM,
[1:20:39] that discouragement went away.
[1:20:44] The the the confusion WENT AWAY.
[1:20:48] EVERY NEGATIVE THING WENT AWAY
[1:20:53] AND THEY WERE QUICKENED IN THEIR SPIRIT,
[1:20:56] QUICKENED IN THEIR BODIES.
[1:20:59] AND WE SAID, "HOW CAN WE SIT
[1:21:03] WHEN WE HAVE WITNESSED
[1:21:06] WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED?
[1:21:08] LET US GO BACK
[1:21:10] AND TELL THE BRETHREN
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; THAT HE IS RISEN."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE BREAKS THE BREAD,
[1:21:19] TO YOU AND YOU SEE HIM AND KNOW HIM. YOU
[1:21:24] CANNOT SIT DOWN.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE A WITNESS
[1:21:31] THAT HE IS NOT DEAD
[1:21:34] IS ALIVE.
[1:21:36] HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; TELL THE BRETHREN
[1:21:39] THAT HE IS RESURRECTED.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; HE IS ALIVE.
[1:21:44] AMEN.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; OH, praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'll bother you to sit a while.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And when they went to his brethren,
[1:21:59] they went back
[1:22:01] to THE BRETHREN
[1:22:03] TO TELL THEM, "DON'T BE DISCOURAGED,
[1:22:06] BROTHER.
[1:22:07] DON'T BE CONFUSED.
[1:22:10] HE IS ALIVE. WE KNOW. WE ARE NOT
[1:22:14] GUESSING.
[1:22:16] WE ARE NOT RECITING SCRIPTURES.
[1:22:19] WE KNOW THAT HE IS ALIVE.
[1:22:23] WE KNOW
[1:22:25] THAT HE IS REAL.
[1:22:28] WE ARE NOT RECITING QUOTATIONS.
[1:22:31] WE KNOW THAT HE IS HERE. PRAISE THE
[1:22:35] LORD. AMEN. BUT THE BRETHREN
[1:22:38] BEING IN THE FLESH
[1:22:40] COULD NOT BELIEVE HIM. THEY WERE IN A
[1:22:43] LOCKED ROOM
[1:22:46] of their lives
[1:22:48] confused and everything
[1:22:52] but the Lord came.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 41
[1:22:58] of Luke chapter 24.
[1:23:01] It says there, "And while they yet
[1:23:03] believed not for joy and wondered, he
[1:23:07] said unto them, have ye here any meat?
[1:23:18] Let's not rush. The pastor said, "We've
[1:23:19] got a bit of time." So, let's read verse
[1:23:22] 32 and continue.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; And they said one to another, "Did not
[1:23:30] our hearts burn within us whilst he
[1:23:33] talked to us by the way?"
[1:23:41] He opened the scriptures to us
[1:23:47] and they rose up the same hour and
[1:23:51] returned to Jerusalem
[1:23:53] and found the 11 gathered together and
[1:23:56] them that were with them.
[1:24:06] And they told what things were done in
[1:24:08] the way and HOW HE WAS KNOWN of them in
[1:24:12] the breaking of bread.
[1:24:20] And as they thus spake, Jesus himself
[1:24:24] stood in the midst of them and said unto
[1:24:27] them, "Peace be unto you.
[1:24:34] When a true witness
[1:24:37] is giving the witness of THE GOSPEL,
[1:24:41] God comes on THE SCENE
[1:24:44] TO BEAR WITNESS
[1:24:45] THAT THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH.
[1:24:49] AS THEY WERE WITNESSING
[1:24:51] THE RESURRECTED CHRIST
[1:24:54] WHOM THEY HAD SEEN AND KNOWN,
[1:24:57] HE CAME RIGHT THERE TO WITNESS THE SAME.
[1:25:01] HE IS STILL THE SAME YESTERDAY
[1:25:04] TODAY AND FOREVER.
[1:25:06] AND WHEN TRUE WITNESSES
[1:25:09] ARE WITNESSING
[1:25:10] THAT HE IS ALIVE, HE COMES ON THE SCENE
[1:25:15] AND BEARS WITNESS
[1:25:17] THAT HE is real and he is alive.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen Lord.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; But they were terrified and afrighted
[1:25:30] and supposed that they had seen a
[1:25:32] spirit.
[1:25:40] It tells you how culture is very strong.
[1:25:48] Have you seen how many times in the
[1:25:50] scripture they thought they had seen a
[1:25:52] spirit
[1:25:57] when they were praying for Peter to be
[1:25:59] released
[1:26:02] and God answered their prayer.
[1:26:05] And when they looked AT THEIR PRAYER,
[1:26:08] THEY THOUGHT they had seen a spirit.
[1:26:14] It tells you that THERE WAS A LOT OF
[1:26:16] TALKS ABOUT SPIRITS AND GHOSTS.
[1:26:23] is the scripture and the fulfillment of
[1:26:25] scripture
[1:26:29] culture and traditions
[1:26:34] and you can do THE SAME.
[1:26:37] GOD ANSWERS your prayer
[1:26:39] and you see a tool there and you see you
[1:26:43] know some AFRICA
[1:26:47] BLACK MAGIC
[1:26:51] BECAUSE YOUR PERCEPTION IS molded
[1:26:55] by
[1:26:58] what has been placed in you.
[1:27:02] BUT THE WORD
[1:27:04] comes to do away with all the wrong
[1:27:06] teaching,
[1:27:08] ALL THE CULTURE AND TRADITIONS
[1:27:11] AND establishes you in the word.
[1:27:15] Anyway, to cut the long story short,
[1:27:19] he shows them that he's not a spirit,
[1:27:24] eats flesh with them.
[1:27:28] And he starts to show them in verse 44.
[1:27:31] And he said unto them,
[1:27:34] "These are the words which I spake unto
[1:27:36] you while I was yet with you,
[1:27:43] that all things must be fulfilled, which
[1:27:45] were written in the law of Moses,
[1:27:52] and in the prophets, and in the Psalms
[1:27:55] concerning me."
[1:28:00] THEN OPENED HE THEIR understanding
[1:28:06] that they might understand the
[1:28:08] scriptures.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; THIS OTHER SIDE OF HIS death
[1:28:17] whilst he was in HIS FLESH
[1:28:21] BEFORE the crucifixion.
[1:28:23] He took his time
[1:28:26] to privately teach
[1:28:29] and expound the scriptures
[1:28:32] TO HIS DISCIPLES.
[1:28:34] AND WE ARE LEARNING NOW
[1:28:36] THAT EVEN AFTER HIS RESURRECTION,
[1:28:40] HE DOES NOT CHANGE HIS PATTERN
[1:28:43] BUT PRIVATELY
[1:28:45] HE STARTS TO VISIT HIS DISCIPLES
[1:28:49] ONE BY ONE.
[1:28:51] CLUS AND HIS FRIEND AND EXPOUND THE
[1:28:55] SCRIPTURES TO THEM
[1:28:57] BEGINNING AT MOSES, THE PROPHETS, the
[1:29:01] psalms
[1:29:04] and expound THE SCRIPTURES.
[1:29:07] AND AS THEY GO TO WITNESS TO THE OTHER
[1:29:09] DISCIPLES,
[1:29:11] HE FOLLOWS THEM AND DOES THE SAME THING
[1:29:15] THAT HE WAS DOING
[1:29:18] BEFORE HIS CRUCIFIXION
[1:29:20] PRIVATELY TO HIS DISCIPLES TO EXPLAIN
[1:29:24] THE SCRIPTURES,
[1:29:26] TEACH THE SCRIPTURES AND OPEN THEIR EYES
[1:29:31] SO THAT THEY MAY.
[1:29:33] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS HE
[1:29:36] OPENED THEIR UNDERSTANDING.
[1:29:39] THAT'S NOT A NATURAL THING
[1:29:42] BECAUSE IN THE NATURAL THEY HAD FAILED
[1:29:45] TO SEE.
[1:29:47] BUT IT WAS A SPIRITUAL THING THAT HE HAD
[1:29:50] TO DO TO OPEN THEIR MINDS,
[1:29:54] UNDERSTAND THE SEASON THAT THEY WERE IN.
[1:29:58] AMEN.
[1:30:03] AND HE DOES NOT CHANGE.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; HE DID IT THEN.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING TO DO THE SAME NOW.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; THAT AFTER TEACHING,
[1:30:13] HE HAS GOT TO COME TO YOU AND OPEN UP
[1:30:16] YOUR UNDERSTANDING
[1:30:18] TO UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES
[1:30:21] AND THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:30:24] YOU CAN BE TAUGHT THE MESSAGE
[1:30:27] BUT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST ACTION
[1:30:31] YOU CANNOT KNOW HIM
[1:30:34] FOR SPIRITUAL THINGS
[1:30:36] ARE SPIRITUALLY DISCERN
[1:30:39] AND YOU NEED THE SPIRIT
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; TO OPEN THE word
[1:30:48] amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED THE SPIRIT
[1:30:54] TO SHOW YOU
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; WHO YOU ARE.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; MOSES
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; WAS TOLD BY HIS MOTHER,
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; "YOU ARE A DELIVERER.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE BORN FOR A PURPOSE.
[1:31:08] YOU CAME INTO THIS WORLD,
[1:31:11] FOR A PURPOSE." AND HE WAS TOLD TIME AND
[1:31:15] TIME again
[1:31:17] until he believed it.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS ONLY A PARTIAL REALIZATION.
[1:31:24] AND HE WENT IN THE POWER OF A PARTIAL
[1:31:29] REALIZATION
[1:31:31] TO CARRY OUT A COMMISSION.
[1:31:34] AND THE PROPHET SAYS,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING HE ACHIEVED
[1:31:39] WAS ONE DEAD STINKING EGYPTIAN.
[1:31:43] THE RESULTS
[1:31:45] OF OPERATING UNDER A PARTIAL REALIZATION
[1:31:50] EMBARRASSMENT
[1:31:51] ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT. THEY ARE A
[1:31:54] FAILURE.
[1:31:55] AND AS A RESULT OF THAT, HE WAS BANISHED
[1:32:00] INTO THE WILDERNESS.
[1:32:02] BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
[1:32:04] SUPERNATURAL
[1:32:06] THAT GOD HAD TO DO TO MOSES.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:12] AND GOD HAD TO APPROACH MOSES
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; IN THE WAY THAT WORKED FOR MOSES.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL HAVE TO APPROACH YOU
[1:32:24] IN THE WAY YOU ARE
[1:32:29] IN YOUR MAKEUP.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; MOSES,
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I'm rushing now.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; It's okay,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; but I'll slow down a bit.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And Moses
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; was a scientific mind.
[1:32:42] He had been well taught
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; in the greatest civilization of that
[1:32:47] TIME
[1:32:49] which was Egypt.
[1:32:51] The ones that were building the
[1:32:52] pyramids,
[1:32:54] THE ONES THAT were imbaling BODIES
[1:32:59] that still look like they could blink
[1:33:01] even now.
[1:33:06] They were an advanced scientific
[1:33:08] CIVILIZATION
[1:33:10] and Moses had received THE BEST
[1:33:15] of that SCIENTIFIC
[1:33:17] AND he was A SCIENTIFIC MIND
[1:33:20] AND HE UNDERSTOOD COMBUSTION
[1:33:25] THAT IF THERE'S FUEL
[1:33:27] oxygen
[1:33:29] oxygen AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THERE'S and and HEAT
[1:33:35] AND COMBUSTION IS TAKING PLACE
[1:33:38] THEN THAT THING SHOULD BURN OUT.
[1:33:43] AND WHEN HE LOOKED AND HIS SCIENTIFIC
[1:33:46] MIND
[1:33:47] COULD NOT COMPREHEND
[1:33:50] WHAT WAS HAPPENING,
[1:33:52] HE WAS ATTRACTED
[1:33:54] TO THE PHENOMENA
[1:33:57] OF THE burning bush.
[1:34:00] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. ANOTHER PERSON
[1:34:05] MIGHT HAVE WALKED AWAY
[1:34:11] AND HE TURNED ASIDE ACCORDING TO THE
[1:34:14] BIBLE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND THAT WAS
[1:34:17] GOD
[1:34:19] SAYING MOSES COMING
[1:34:21] AND TALKED TO HIM. AND HE EXPERIENCED
[1:34:26] SOMETHING THAT WAS REAL.
[1:34:29] FROM THAT EXPERIENCE,
[1:34:32] MOSES BECAME A DIFFERENT MAN.
[1:34:36] AMEN.
[1:34:38] AMEN.
[1:34:40] NOW, how did he become a different man?
[1:34:45] The prophet says,
[1:34:47] Moses was born with the equipment in HIM
[1:34:52] to deliver Israel.
[1:34:55] HE DID NOT BECOME a different man
[1:34:58] because new things were added to him.
[1:35:03] HE BECAME A DIFFERENT MAN
[1:35:06] BECAUSE WHAT WAS ALREADY IN HIM
[1:35:11] WAS QUICKENED
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; BY THE PRESENCE of God.
[1:35:16] Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; MOSES
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; WAS MADE CONSCIOUS
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; OF WHO HE WAS.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; HE WAS MADE CONSCIOUS
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; IN A SUPERNATURAL WAY.
[1:35:32] THE SAME MESSAGE THAT HIS MOTHER HAD
[1:35:35] TOLD HIM WAS NOW QUICKENED
[1:35:39] TO HIM BY THE SPIRIT.
[1:35:42] LET ME SAY TO YOU BROTHERS and sister
[1:35:45] the same message
[1:35:47] that the mother church
[1:35:49] has been teaching you telling you THAT
[1:35:53] YOU ARE BRIDE THAT YOU ARE SONS AND
[1:35:55] DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:35:57] BEEN A TRUE MESSAGE, BUT YOU MAY NOT BE
[1:36:00] ACTING LIKE A SON
[1:36:03] OR ACTING LIKE A DAUGHTER.
[1:36:05] THAT MESSAGE
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; HAS NOT YET BEEN QUICKENED.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; AND WE PRAY THIS AFTERNOON
[1:36:14] THAT YOU MAY RECEIVE A QUICKENING.
[1:36:18] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; OF THE MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN PLANTED IN
[1:36:22] YOU.
[1:36:23] YOU ARE A SON OF GOD.
[1:36:26] YOU CAME FROM GOD. YOU GO BACK TO GOD.
[1:36:32] AMEN.
[1:36:35] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN, LORD.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE
[1:36:42] TO BRING YOU TO AN AWAKENING
[1:36:46] TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT AN
[1:36:48] ACCIDENT.
[1:36:50] YOU CAME ON THIS EARTH FOR A PURPOSE.
[1:36:54] YOU WERE PREDESTINATED
[1:36:57] TO COME ON THIS EARTH TO BE A SON OF
[1:37:00] GOD, TO BE A DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:37:04] HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY BE SEATED a bit.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen Lord.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; In the message harvest time.
[1:37:23] Hallelujah.
[1:37:24] No man can come to me, said Jesus,
[1:37:29] except my father draws him.
[1:37:33] And all that the father hath
[1:37:40] past tense,
[1:37:44] that the father hath given me.
[1:37:50] Hath is already PAST TENSE.
[1:37:54] It's already been DONE
[1:37:58] that the father had given ME
[1:38:02] COME TO ME
[1:38:04] to the word.
[1:38:07] How can they come
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; unless they were all they were for
[1:38:14] ordained to COME
[1:38:21] as many as received him.
[1:38:25] To them gave he the power to become sons
[1:38:28] of God.
[1:38:33] See, because their names were on the
[1:38:36] book,
[1:38:40] HE COME TO redeem
[1:38:44] what was on THE BOOK.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; IN REVELATION, WE FIND out
[1:38:50] when the seals was opened,
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; there was a book
[1:38:57] and HIM THAT SAT UPON THE THRONE,
[1:39:02] HE HAD IT IN his right hand
[1:39:05] and there wasn't nothing nobody in
[1:39:08] heaven or in earth or anywhere was
[1:39:10] worthy to take the book
[1:39:17] or to even look on it.
[1:39:21] John wept with great
[1:39:25] because the whole book of redemption
[1:39:30] was there.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; SO THAT BOOK
[1:39:35] THAT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE ONE WHO SAT
[1:39:38] ON THE THRONE,
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; THE BOOK WHICH NO MAN WAS WORTHY
[1:39:46] WAS WORTHY
[1:39:47] ON
[1:39:51] take that book.
[1:39:53] THE LAMB
[1:39:55] MOVED IN AND TOOK THAT BOOK.
[1:39:58] AND THE PROPHET IS SAYING BECAUSE IT was
[1:40:02] the whole book of REDEMPTION
[1:40:06] RIGHT THERE.
[1:40:08] Are we together? Amen. And then in the
[1:40:10] third seal,
[1:40:12] the prophet says,
[1:40:14] EVERYBODY IN HEAVEN,
[1:40:17] EVERYTHING BENEATH THE EARTH
[1:40:20] AND EVERYTHING
[1:40:23] HEARD HIM PRAISING GOD ABOUT IT,
[1:40:27] JOHN
[1:40:29] MUST HAVE FOUND HIS NAME ON.
[1:40:35] HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. JOHN MUST HAVE FOUND HIS NAME ON
[1:40:40] THERE.
[1:40:43] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. SO IT IS THE BOOK
[1:40:46] the complete book of redemption
[1:40:50] the whole BOOK OF REDEMPTION
[1:40:53] BUT IT IS ALSO A BOOK OF NAMES
[1:40:56] BECAUSE WHEN JOHN LOOKED IN
[1:40:59] HE SAW HIS NAME AND REJOICED GREATLY.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH. AMEN. SO IT IS A BOOK OF
[1:41:07] NAMES.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; My oh my.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Question and answers on the seals.
[1:41:18] The prophet is asked a question.
[1:41:21] Is it true that every Jew born since
[1:41:25] Christ that came into the world is to be
[1:41:27] saved?
[1:41:35] No, nothing will be saved. Only those
[1:41:38] whose names were put on the lamb's book
[1:41:40] of life
[1:41:46] before the foundation of the world,
[1:41:50] Jew or Gentile.
[1:41:54] See, that's all
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; the book
[1:41:58] holds that mystery.
[1:42:02] AND THE BOOK
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; IS only unfolding it now.
[1:42:10] Not each one's name.
[1:42:15] I said it is a book of names.
[1:42:18] It is the whole book of
[1:42:21] someone is expecting to see their name
[1:42:23] in THERE
[1:42:26] as in THE WAY YOUR MOTHER and your
[1:42:28] father named you.
[1:42:32] It is propaganda
[1:42:34] that made you believe
[1:42:37] that your NAME IS MICHAEL BECAUSE THEY
[1:42:40] WERE CALLING YOU MICHAEL OVER AND OVER
[1:42:43] AGAIN
[1:42:45] UNTIL YOU BELIEVED IT, THAT YOUR NAME IS
[1:42:48] MICHAEL
[1:42:50] AND YOUR SURNAME ISMA
[1:42:53] BECAUSE that's what they TOLD YOU.
[1:42:56] THAT'S WHAT THEY PUT ON YOUR PAPER
[1:42:58] AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT. BUT GOD DOES NOT
[1:43:02] WRITE YOUR NAME LIKE THAT.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS
[1:43:12] CONNECTED TO YOUR BIRTH.
[1:43:16] I AM A
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN THAT FAMILY
[1:43:22] AND I INHERITED THE NAME
[1:43:25] AND GOD THE FATHER
[1:43:28] HAS GOT A NAME FOR YOU AND THAT NAME IS
[1:43:32] CONNECTED
[1:43:34] TO YOUR SPIRITUAL GENES.
[1:43:38] YOUR NAME ON YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE
[1:43:41] IS CONNECTED TO YOUR NATURAL GENES.
[1:43:44] BUT YOUR NAME IN HEAVEN IS CONNECTED TO
[1:43:48] YOUR SPIRITUAL TEAM.
[1:43:51] AND AND WHEN GOD WRITES IT IN A BOOK,
[1:43:56] HE WRITES IT IN A SPIRITUAL WAY
[1:44:00] SO THAT THE SPIRITUAL SEED IN YOU
[1:44:03] IS ABLE TO READ
[1:44:06] AND SEE THE NAME.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:15] PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; AND HOW DOES HE WRITE IT?
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; He doesn't write no. Not in each one's
[1:44:23] name,
[1:44:26] but what the mystery of the book is
[1:44:34] while it's calling those names.
[1:44:38] YOU FINALLY UNDERSTAND THAT NOW.
[1:44:42] See the book doesn't say
[1:44:46] now LE IS TO BE SAVED IN TIME of this
[1:44:49] church age
[1:44:53] or
[1:44:56] whoever.
[1:44:58] NO, IT DON'T SAY THAT.
[1:45:01] IT JUST SHOWS THE MYSTERY
[1:45:06] UNFOLDS THE MYSTERY OF WHAT THE THING
[1:45:08] IS.
[1:45:12] BUT WE OURSELVES
[1:45:15] BY FAITH
[1:45:17] BELIEVE IT.
[1:45:19] AND WHAT IS FAITH?
[1:45:22] REVELATION.
[1:45:23] WE BY REVELATION
[1:45:25] ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE BOOK
[1:45:28] AND SEE OUR NAMES
[1:45:31] BECAUSE IT IS A MYSTERY
[1:45:33] OF OUR LIVES.
[1:45:35] IT IS A MYSTERY OF OUR FAMILY.
[1:45:40] AND MY NAME
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; IS RIGHT THERE.
[1:45:45] AMEN.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Let me skip some things here. All right,
[1:45:57] I'm watching the time.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The anointed ones at the end
[1:46:02] time.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Okay, I I can't skip this. I think it's
[1:46:08] too good. Just skip it. The spoken word
[1:46:11] is the original seed.
[1:46:15] That's what's the matter today.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; You want some kind of a phony makeup,
[1:46:21] screaming, jumping, speaking in tongues
[1:46:23] or something
[1:46:30] instead of waiting for the real word of
[1:46:33] God to be made manifest THROUGH THE
[1:46:36] BRIDE.
[1:46:43] AND WHO'S THE BRIDE?
[1:46:45] Them kind
[1:46:47] that takes the word
[1:46:50] is God's true bride bringing forth
[1:46:52] children.
[1:46:55] They can't die.
[1:46:58] A CHILD THE BRIDE BRINGS FORTH ON THE
[1:47:00] WORD
[1:47:04] CAN'T DIE BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; DID YOU GET IT? SHE CAN DIE
[1:47:14] BECAUSE THAT CHILD CAN DIE
[1:47:16] because he's a word child.
[1:47:20] He's a seed.
[1:47:24] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE SEED HOLDS TRUE.
[1:47:28] THEY WILL GO RUNNING FOR THE PASTOR.
[1:47:31] THEY WILL GO RUNNING TO THE DEACON
[1:47:33] TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
[1:47:36] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVENLY BEINGS,
[1:47:41] CANDIDATES OF ASSOCIATION,
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; TWO ANGELIC BEINGS,
[1:47:52] the anointed ones of the end time.
[1:47:56] Notice the very day when this messenger,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; not when he starts on, but when he
[1:48:06] begins to declare
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; THIRDP MINISTRY
[1:48:17] IS THE MINISTRY OF THE OPENING OF the
[1:48:19] word
[1:48:22] and THERE IS A CLASS OF PEOPLE
[1:48:25] ARE CALLED BY THE THIRD POOL.
[1:48:29] BECAUSE IN THE MYSTERY OF THE THIRD POOL
[1:48:33] IS THE MYSTERY OF THEIR NAMES
[1:48:36] IS THE MYSTERY OF THEIR LIVES.
[1:48:40] They are rainbow trout.
[1:48:44] YOU CAN'T FISH THEM THE SAME WAY YOU
[1:48:47] FISH OTHER FISH.
[1:48:50] But you've GOT TO GIVE IT A HARDER PULL.
[1:48:54] HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; TO ATTRACT
[1:48:58] THE RAINBOW TROUT
[1:49:00] RAINBOW
[1:49:08] COVENANT TO GOD'S PEOPLE. THEY ARE A
[1:49:12] COVENANT PEOPLE
[1:49:14] AND THEY BELIEVE A COVENANT MESSAGE.
[1:49:20] AMEN.
[1:49:23] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; And the brother says,
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; "There's no more higher order to reveal
[1:49:30] the word
[1:49:35] than prophets."
[1:49:38] But the only way the prophet can be
[1:49:40] vindicated
[1:49:44] is by the word
[1:49:48] and
[1:49:50] to reveal
[1:49:53] TO REVEAL THE HIDDEN truth
[1:49:59] that's been sealed in the word.
[1:50:03] I want to repeat this. The third pool
[1:50:08] was the opening of them. The third pool
[1:50:12] was the opening of them seven SEALS
[1:50:21] in the word
[1:50:25] was the attraction on the mountain.
[1:50:29] I've got my mind set on THIS MESSAGE.
[1:50:36] THAT'S that dead pool
[1:50:39] is the one I must be loyal and reverent
[1:50:42] to.
[1:50:49] Amen. And I won't turn back.
[1:50:53] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. I'VE GOT MY MIND
[1:50:57] ON THIS MESSAGE.
[1:51:00] IT'S THAT THIRD POOL.
[1:51:03] It is the RISING OF THE SUN.
[1:51:06] HE SAYS he is the one who opened those
[1:51:10] seals.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; He is those seals
[1:51:18] FOR THE WHOLE WORD OF GOD
[1:51:23] IS CHRIST
[1:51:25] AND CHRIST
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; IS THE SEALS.
[1:51:29] THAT WAS OPENED.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE OPENING OF THE SEALS THEN?
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE OPENING OF THE SEALS THERE?
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; THE REVEALING OF CHRIST.
[1:51:44] AMEN.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST. HE IS STILL DOING THE SAME
[1:51:52] THING,
[1:51:54] VISITING HIS CHILDREN
[1:51:57] PRIVATELY,
[1:51:59] EXPOUNDING THE SCRIPTURES,
[1:52:02] EXPOUNDING THE SCRIPTURES,
[1:52:05] STARTING FROM PAUL, FROM
[1:52:10] MARTIN, FROM COLUMBA,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; FROM LUTHER RIGHT TO THIS DAY.
[1:52:17] HE IS EXPOUNDING
[1:52:19] TO HIS PEOPLE
[1:52:21] WHO HE IS.
[1:52:24] AMEN.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen Lord.
[1:52:29] Oh,
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Future home.
[1:52:36] Why is it important
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; for him TO REVEAL HIMSELF?
[1:52:42] BECAUSE IN THE REVEALING OF HIMSELF
[1:52:45] IS THE REVEALING of his bride.
[1:52:49] And in the message future home,
[1:52:53] paragraph 267.
[1:52:56] And if you are the bride,
[1:52:59] the bride
[1:53:01] is a part of the husband.
[1:53:05] The only PLACE
[1:53:08] THAT YOU WILL EVER RECOGNIZE IT
[1:53:11] IS TO RECOGNIZE WHAT PART OF THAT
[1:53:14] HUSBAND,
[1:53:19] WHAT PART OF THAT WORLD you are,
[1:53:24] you can't recognize
[1:53:27] BEING THE BRIDE.
[1:53:29] HOW MANY SEES THAT?
[1:53:32] YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE
[1:53:35] YOUR POSITION.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; THE MINISTRY OF ELIZA
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; WAS A MINISTRY TO EXPLAIN JESUS CHRIST.
[1:53:47] HALLELUJAH. AND HE EXPLAINED HIM SO
[1:53:49] WELL.
[1:53:51] HE WAS SAYING NOT ABOUT HIMSELF
[1:53:54] BUT HE WAS SPEAKING
[1:53:57] OF HIS MASTER'S SON.
[1:54:03] Oh my master son. Amen.
[1:54:06] Oh, he is so handsome.
[1:54:09] He is so good-looking.
[1:54:12] He is so wellmannered.
[1:54:15] He is so hardwork.
[1:54:18] He is so caring.
[1:54:20] If he were TO HAVE A WIFE
[1:54:23] LIKE YOU, he would give you heaven.
[1:54:27] He would do EVERYTHING FOR YOU.
[1:54:30] OH, MY MASTER'S SON.
[1:54:34] ISAAC, he Oh, they come from a wealthy
[1:54:37] place.
[1:54:39] They have riches.

[1:54:46] I'M NOT TELLING YOU FABLES.
[1:54:48] I COME FROM a rich people.
[1:54:52] Eliza
[1:54:53] had camels
[1:54:56] FULL OF TREASURES.
[1:54:58] CAMELS
[1:55:00] FULL OF TREASURES
[1:55:02] TO PROVE THAT HIS STORY
[1:55:05] IS TRUE.
[1:55:07] HALLELUJAH. AND THIS GENERATION
[1:55:11] HAS NOT SEEN A GIFT LIKE THAT.
[1:55:14] ONE OF THE MOST GIFTED
[1:55:19] TO DEMONSTRATE
[1:55:21] THAT HIS MESSAGE
[1:55:23] WAS A TRUE MESSAGE.
[1:55:25] AND HIS MESSAGE WAS COMING FROM GOD.
[1:55:30] HE WAS NOT TELLING FABLES.
[1:55:32] HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

[2:17:38] friends,
[2:17:42] there's a presence of the Holy Spirit in
[2:17:44] this place.
[2:17:48] When the word goes forth
[2:17:51] and we begin to worship him,
[2:17:54] then things begin to happen
[2:17:57] because the supernatural element kicks
[2:17:59] IN
[2:18:02] because of the word.
[2:18:05] The prophet would call it watering the
[2:18:06] word.
[2:18:10] Now, what situation
[2:18:12] is in your life that you thought is TOO
[2:18:15] HARD?
[2:18:17] THEN you realize
[2:18:19] in his presence
[2:18:21] it's all nothing
[2:18:26] melts AWAY
[2:18:29] because Jesus never fails.
[2:18:33] You won't even need laying on of hands
[2:18:38] because you're going to be revived FOR
[2:18:40] SURE.
[2:18:42] COME INTO a perfect REALIZATION
[2:18:48] of who you are.
[2:18:59] His
[2:19:05] name is Jesus.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:21] He never fails.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Let us sing just this song together
[2:19:25] friends.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Come on sister charity.
[2:19:47] I
[2:19:52] tell him
[2:20:18] Yes.
[2:20:26] Yes.
[2:20:32] Never
[2:20:44] Jesus.
[2:21:01] Jesus
[2:21:04] name.
[2:21:12] They call him Jesus.
[2:21:21] They call him Jesus.
[2:21:30] They call it Jesus.
[2:21:36] Never f
[2:21:46] Heat.
[2:21:53] Heat.

[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:22:20] During this service,
[2:22:28] I want you to know what you have heard.
[2:22:32] You are not who they said you are.
[2:22:38] You are not who you felt you were.
[2:22:42] You are NOT WHO THE DEVIL THOUGHT YOU
[2:22:44] WERE.
[2:22:48] YOU HAVE COME TO A REALIZATION
[2:22:51] THAT YOU ARE A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[2:22:56] You are here to live a victorious life.
[2:23:00] YOU A MANIFESTED SON, MANIFESTED
[2:23:03] DAUGHTER.
[2:23:07] You cannot fall.
[2:23:10] You are going to the rapture.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Not because of what you did.
[2:23:17] or what you never did,
[2:23:21] but because of his fornowledge
[2:23:26] and he CHOSE YOU IN HIM
[2:23:29] BEFORE the foundation of the world
[2:23:32] and you are coming to that perfect
[2:23:34] realization.
[2:23:38] Your condition doesn't control you.
[2:23:42] YOUR SITUATION DOESN'T CONTROL YOU.
[2:23:45] YOU CAME FROM GOD, YOU GO BACK TO GOD.
[2:23:49] YOU ARE A THOUGHT OF GOD EXPRESSED.

[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:24:31] every time after camp,
[2:24:34] after services like this,
[2:24:37] I hear a great testimony.
[2:24:40] So
[2:24:42] I'm not wondering
[2:24:45] but I know
[2:24:48] lives are being turned around
[2:24:53] situations are being changed in your
[2:24:55] life.
[2:24:57] You are coming to that place
[2:25:01] of perfect realization.
[2:25:06] Yes Lord.
[2:25:09] Yes Lord.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.

[2:25:23] This is why we are here
[2:25:26] at come.
[2:25:30] The word will be preached.
[2:25:33] But there is that supernatural element
[2:25:37] that cannot be done by man.
[2:25:41] But only God can
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; and he is here.
[2:25:47] So let's not rush it.
[2:25:50] Let's give it a moment.
[2:25:58] Oh yes.
[2:26:00] It's not It's more than emotions,
[2:26:02] friends.
[2:26:07] It's more than emotion.
[2:26:11] Goes way beyond that.
[2:26:13] We've seen lives change.
[2:26:16] YOURS can change.
[2:26:20] Maybe the devil lied to you
[2:26:23] and told you you are a sinner.
[2:26:26] YOU ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING.
[2:26:28] You are not the bride. But we have had
[2:26:31] DIFFERENT TODAY.
[2:26:33] THOSE ARE LIES.
[2:26:35] LIES.
[2:26:37] You are here because you are a child of
[2:26:40] God.
[2:26:43] Something drew on you to come.
[2:26:46] Something drew you
[2:26:50] to come here.
[2:26:53] And you are here.
[2:26:56] And he is here.
[2:27:00] Something is bound to happen.

[2:27:55] to this place,
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; the place
[2:28:00] of our anointing.
[2:28:07] Someone is receiving a fresh anointing,
[2:28:13] fresh revelation,
[2:28:17] revival in OUR SOUL.
[2:28:20] REVIVAL IS not to revive those who are
[2:28:22] new and coming out coming from the
[2:28:24] world.
[2:28:29] But those WHO ARE THERE,
[2:28:32] WE ARE HERE, LORD.
[2:28:34] You're reviving us again.
[2:28:36] For this is the bright revival,
[2:28:40] the perfect realization
[2:28:44] of who we are.

[2:29:12] my heart.

[2:29:17] my heart.

[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; There are people here
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; that the devil had lied to
[2:29:59] and told you you were not the bride.
[2:30:04] That's a lie.
[2:30:07] Now listen
[2:30:09] and you've been beating yourself
[2:30:14] thinking all is lost and you're lost.
[2:30:18] Now, we're going to do something
[2:30:20] different.
[2:30:22] You may be two or three. I don't know.
[2:30:26] I'm inviting you to come.
[2:30:29] This is your moment.
[2:30:31] This is why you came to come.
[2:30:35] Just a mere fact of walking from your
[2:30:37] seat
[2:30:40] and walking to the altar.
[2:30:44] You don't have to kneel.
[2:30:46] Just come and stand.
[2:30:48] When the boy came,
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; he came to himself
[2:30:55] to A REALIZATION.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; HE did not STAY WHERE HE WAS.
[2:31:00] He walked to HIS FATHER.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; AND he said, "FATHER,
[2:31:07] here I am.
[2:31:10] RECEIVE ME
[2:31:12] AT LEAST AS A SERVANT."
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WAS PARTIAL REALIZATION.
[2:31:19] HE NEEDED TO COME TO PERFECT
[2:31:20] REALIZATION.
[2:31:23] Now I want you to walk here.
[2:31:25] COME INTO A FULL REALIZATION
[2:31:28] THAT your sins that have been in your
[2:31:30] life
[2:31:32] don't count anymore.
[2:31:36] You have come to a realization
[2:31:39] that I'm a son,
[2:31:41] a child of my father.
[2:31:46] No matter what comes and goes
[2:31:49] who I am does not change.
[2:31:54] Hallelujah. That cow was not fattened
[2:31:57] that day.
[2:32:02] He has always been a son.
[2:32:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:32:10] Friends,
[2:32:12] this is why we came to come.
[2:32:17] You do not know how my heart feels
[2:32:23] to see people come into a realization
[2:32:27] that they are the generation of the
[2:32:29] righteous
[2:32:32] no matter what a devil had done in their
[2:32:34] lives,
[2:32:36] battered them,
[2:32:39] broken some bones,
[2:32:42] gone through thick and thick,
[2:32:47] to all is gone.
[2:32:50] But there CAN BE A REVIVAL AGAIN.
[2:32:54] HALLELUJAH.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:32:59] HALLELUJAH.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:33:02] Thank you Jesus.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:33:09] Maybe there is some more.
[2:33:13] Maybe there's some more.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the lies of the devil.
[2:33:21] Listen,
[2:33:23] one of the camps we had,
[2:33:27] a young lady just made a trip to come at
[2:33:29] the altar.
[2:33:32] She was just on the verge
[2:33:36] of completely going to the world,
[2:33:40] but God restored HER RIGHT NOW.
[2:33:43] AND SHE'S STILL STANDING today
[2:33:47] serving God
[2:33:49] because it's not just an emotion.
[2:33:52] IT'S A LIVING REALITY.
[2:33:55] THE GOD OF this message is a real God.
[2:34:01] This is what the third pool is.
[2:34:06] The realization,
[2:34:08] perfect realization
[2:34:10] of who you are that comes by the WORD
[2:34:18] moved on you by the Holy Ghost.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; Come into my heart.
[2:34:38] Lord Jesus
[2:34:40] Jesus
[2:34:42] come
[2:34:44] today
[2:34:49] to stay.
[2:34:53] Come into my heart.
[2:34:58] Oh Jesus.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; To you at the altar.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; When they came,
[2:35:09] the father never told that that boy
[2:35:14] that he will take the place of a servant
[2:35:18] because you've done so much that is bad.
[2:35:22] Listen,
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; the actions that were in his life
[2:35:30] in the past
[2:35:32] when the perfect realization of who he
[2:35:34] was came
[2:35:38] did not matter anymore.
[2:35:42] There's a shift happening
[2:35:47] in his life
[2:35:50] and he was never the same again.
[2:35:54] So I'd be right if I tell you right now,
[2:35:58] you young people at the altar,
[2:36:00] I'd be right if I prophesied over your
[2:36:02] life
[2:36:04] and I tell you, you will never be the
[2:36:05] same.
[2:36:08] It doesn't matter what the DEVIL'S TOLD
[2:36:09] YOU.
[2:36:11] It doesn't matter how much you've been
[2:36:12] beaten down.
[2:36:15] IT doesn't matter WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.
[2:36:18] YOU HAVE COME to a PERFECT REALIZATION.
[2:36:21] YOU ARE A SON OF GOD.
[2:36:24] SOMETHING IN YOU
[2:36:26] DREW YOU HERE.
[2:36:28] I DIDN'T CALL YOU BY NAME. THE NAME THAT
[2:36:31] YOUR FATHER CALLED YOU. THE NAME THAT
[2:36:34] YOUR MOTHER CALLED YOU. BUT WHEN THE
[2:36:36] WORD WAS GONE,
[2:36:38] YOU HEARD YOUR NAME BEING CALLED. AND
[2:36:40] THEN THE HOLY GHOST MOVED ON MY HEART TO
[2:36:43] INVITE YOU HERE.
[2:36:45] INVITE YOU.
[2:36:47] THIS WAS FOR YOU. YOUR NAME HAS BEEN
[2:36:50] CALLED. YOU CAN NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.
[2:36:54] HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:58] Lord Jesus,
[2:37:03] I'm asking you, Lord, to come and take
[2:37:04] over
[2:37:07] in the lives of these young people,
[2:37:08] Lord.
[2:37:11] May they walk away from this camp
[2:37:15] and may they all of a sudden
[2:37:19] realize
[2:37:22] there has been a shift in their life.
[2:37:26] The things that were defeating them,
[2:37:30] they will walk over it.
[2:37:33] You will move mountains on their behalf.
[2:37:36] You will move mountains for them.
[2:37:39] Yes.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Cause walls to fall.
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:07] Oh, what a praises
[2:38:15] in the presence.
[2:38:22] Brother Shalom, help me. of Jehovah.
[2:38:31] God, Lord Almighty,
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; Prince
[2:38:40] of Peace.
[2:38:42] Let the prince of peace come into your
[2:38:45] heart.
[2:38:48] Troubles
[2:38:49] vanished.
[2:39:01] Hallelujah.
[2:39:04] In the praise
[2:39:11] of the king. We sing it one more time as
[2:39:15] you go. Check your seats. In the
[2:39:17] presence, everybody now. In the
[2:39:22] presence,

[2:39:52] &gt;&gt; Trles.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; Hearts are being mened right now.
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; Hearts.
[2:40:20] Oh,
[2:40:22] the king
[2:40:29] in the praise
[2:40:38] of
[2:40:47] Thank you, Lord.
[2:40:49] Let everyone give the Lord a great clap.
[2:41:01] Amen.
[2:41:06] Amen. Let us put our hands together to
[2:41:08] appreciate God for our
[2:41:15] God bless you, Pastor Michael.
[2:41:19] You know when he says takes a
[2:41:20] supernatural element,
[2:41:25] the pastor, the preachers, they can
[2:41:27] teach and teach.
[2:41:32] that got to me
[2:41:37] because I experienced that.
[2:41:41] But I've decided
[2:41:43] to quit my church
[2:41:45] because I found father truth.
[2:41:49] But I had had IT FOR SIX MONTHS
[2:41:52] UNTIL that supernatural element.
[2:41:57] Nothing happened before.
[2:42:04] I relate to that.
[2:42:09] some years ago,
[2:42:11] a man in Ethiopia,
[2:42:13] we walked into Ethiopia, just myself and
[2:42:16] my wife
[2:42:18] and u because we had gone for our
[2:42:20] honeymoon
[2:42:22] and so you know we um preach the word a
[2:42:26] few places
[2:42:30] and one person believes the message.
[2:42:33] Her name is Yodit.
[2:42:35] And when sister Yodi received the
[2:42:36] message,
[2:42:38] her life it was like it was QUICKENED
[2:42:42] came to life. SHE CAME TO A REALIZATION
[2:42:46] OF WHO SHE IS AND SHE GOT ON FIRE
[2:42:50] STARTED INVITING PEOPLE.
[2:42:53] EVERYBODY SHE KNEW, SHE WANTED THEM TO
[2:42:55] RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE.
[2:42:57] IF YOU'RE CONVINCED THAT THIS MESSAGE IS
[2:42:59] THE TRUTH, YOU'RE GOING TO BE CONCERNED
[2:43:01] ABOUT IT.
[2:43:07] And so what she did, she quickly ran and
[2:43:10] called a few friends. And then she came
[2:43:13] and told me, "There is this friend of
[2:43:14] mine.
[2:43:16] He's in the Bible college,
[2:43:19] very good preacher,
[2:43:21] but I I I believe he received the
[2:43:24] message." So he he brought him and you
[2:43:27] know so we we sat down and talked the
[2:43:31] first day talked the second day talked
[2:43:32] the third day there seemed to be nothing
[2:43:35] there
[2:43:37] but one day
[2:43:39] this man comes to a perfect realization
[2:43:44] I think other brothers had even met him
[2:43:46] already
[2:43:47] nothing happened I met him nothing
[2:43:49] happened but one day in my office at the
[2:43:54] church he says I've seen it.
[2:43:57] And he now started fidgeting.
[2:44:01] He said, "I don't know now. Advise me
[2:44:05] because I have seen it and I want to be
[2:44:07] baptized right now. But my wife, I have
[2:44:11] not seen it yet. So what should I do?
[2:44:14] Should I hide it from HER FOR NOW?" HE
[2:44:16] WAS ON FIRE. AND I TOLD HIM, "BROTHER,
[2:44:19] do whatever is in your heart." HE SAID,
[2:44:21] "BAPTIZE ME NOW, AND I WILL SORT MY wife
[2:44:24] later.
[2:44:26] THAT MAN IS RIGHT HERE."
[2:44:31] HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS IT?
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; A PERFECT REALIZATION.
[2:44:37] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Michael, you put me on fire.
[2:44:44] We have to go for lunch, but I feel like
[2:44:47] I can preach a sermon.
[2:44:51] Amen.
[2:44:52] And he's one of them.
[2:44:55] Those men are turning Ethiopia up
[2:44:58] with this message of the hour. I tell
[2:45:01] you, our friends, this message is not
[2:45:03] some church.
[2:45:06] We thank God for men that have carried
[2:45:08] it over the years.
[2:45:12] In our country, we have men like Pastor
[2:45:14] Gideon.
[2:45:17] This man has preached
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; on radio,
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; on TV.
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; He's traveled,
[2:45:24] western Uganda, many places for about
[2:45:28] how many years? 30 something years.
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; 27 years.
[2:45:34] 27 years.
[2:45:37] Hallelujah.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; And pastor, we appreciate you for your
[2:45:40] support standing with us. It's a big big
[2:45:44] encouragement.
[2:45:46] Amen. Yes. I think there are even some
[2:45:48] young people from speckled band.
[2:45:51] If you're from raise up your hand, God
[2:45:53] bless you.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; We appreciate you all.
[2:45:59] Appreciate God for Pastor Gideon and his
[2:46:01] ministry.
[2:46:03] Amen. When I met brother Isaac for my
[2:46:06] first time,
[2:46:09] I was amazed.
[2:46:12] &gt;&gt; It was in Gasher.
[2:46:14] And this man I had seen brother Don Rian
[2:46:16] preach
[2:46:18] and um so when I saw him preach
[2:46:21] I was like this is the African version.
[2:46:27] I EVEN THINK brother Isaac has not given
[2:46:31] us his best.
[2:46:35] You still have a debt to pay.
[2:46:38] Don't you think I don't know that?
[2:46:41] And we appreciate you, brother Isaac and
[2:46:43] all our brethren from Kenya. Now we can
[2:46:46] go back and tell our people and our
[2:46:48] family
[2:46:51] we have come to a perfect realization
[2:46:55] who we are.
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when I met Pastor Michael
[2:47:01] in Path and maybe you may not know but
[2:47:04] he has one of the largest assemblies in
[2:47:06] Australia
[2:47:09] if not the largest.
[2:47:13] And this is um um I I saw his vision
[2:47:17] and his focus
[2:47:19] and his burden and I told him I I see a
[2:47:22] lot of myself in him
[2:47:26] and I I I felt connected
[2:47:29] and I quickly knew that we would work
[2:47:32] together and so I'm so honored that you
[2:47:35] accepted our invitation.
[2:47:38] Amen. This is uh just the beginning.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; I wish you were going to preach a few
[2:47:44] more times.
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many appreciate they were?
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you.
[2:47:53] &gt;&gt; I think we just have to dismiss now.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; And um and go back to now have lunch.
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; So, we have about an hour.
[2:48:05] Um, so we'll be back here at 1:45.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; The service is beginning at 1:45
[2:48:13] and Brother Joshua Walker will be
[2:48:15] speaking to us about
[2:48:18] so for him.
[2:48:21] Pray for him. Let us pray for all the
[2:48:23] speakers
[2:48:25] that God will use them. And you know,
[2:48:28] Pastor Pastor Michael said something
[2:48:31] today.
[2:48:33] He said, um, if something is said
[2:48:39] by any of the preachers
[2:48:41] and you know it sounds like an opinion,
[2:48:45] it's it's not based on the word.
[2:48:49] You young people, stay with your
[2:48:51] pastor's teaching.
[2:48:54] I have never been accused and it's not
[2:48:56] my intention
[2:49:00] to gather young people and bundle them
[2:49:03] into a certain doctrine.
[2:49:06] These meetings are not doctrine based.
[2:49:10] It's not camp based.
[2:49:13] We are not part of any camp.
[2:49:15] It's all about the message of God.
[2:49:19] Amen. And so, uh, but if the man of
