[1:02:25] the way we do our business is sometimes
[1:02:28] we have the capital other times we don't
[1:02:30] have it
[1:02:32] uh
[1:02:40] there are some men I worked with I
[1:02:43] wanted to buy rice and I was working
[1:02:46] with those men
[1:02:53] and I told them that I have 50 Millions
[1:02:56] but the rice which I wanted it was worth
[1:02:58] 100 Millions
[1:03:01] all of them are accepted and we work
[1:03:03] together
[1:03:07] we did everything as planned
[1:03:15] as we are calling cars to pack the rice
[1:03:18] one of the men said for me you don't
[1:03:21] pack my rice before you pay for it
[1:03:26] I tried my level best to pay that money
[1:03:32] and even another person says even my
[1:03:35] rice is not going anywhere
[1:03:38] I was really troubled
[1:03:42] the other one was demanding 17 Millions
[1:03:47] I didn't have anywhere to get that money
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:56] I never remembered to go back before God
[1:04:03] for them they were saying pray that much
[1:04:05] had to go
[1:04:08] inside
[1:04:13] I prayed to God and I said Lord open my
[1:04:16] eyes so that I can see where to get
[1:04:18] money
[1:04:19] um
[1:04:22] when I called one of my children and let
[1:04:25] me try my best and see
[1:04:30] the child the young man tried his level
[1:04:33] best and deposited 17 Millions
[1:04:39] having a balance of 25 million of the
[1:04:43] total Sam
[1:04:47] for them they have ways they do their
[1:04:50] things if you don't to make them happy
[1:04:52] they don't allow you to go again
[1:05:00] and I told this brother that we are here
[1:05:03] but by the time we shall go back even
[1:05:05] this other man demanding 25 million
[1:05:07] would have changed his mind
[1:05:15] they had already brought the cars so I
[1:05:18] told the man to start packing the cars
[1:05:23] on the cars
[1:05:32] then I saw the man who was connecting us
[1:05:35] he came and told us you know things are
[1:05:37] really not easy now
[1:05:41] even the other man who was demanding 25
[1:05:44] million he said that before you pay him
[1:05:46] you can only be here
[1:05:49] that was almost the third one
[1:05:52] we went to spend one day
[1:05:55] foreign
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:07] back to court
[1:06:09] y name
[1:06:15] so I told them that offload some other
[1:06:18] rice that was six times and then I shall
[1:06:21] go
[1:06:22] much
[1:06:25] we had already deposited 500 thousands
[1:06:28] in that rice
[1:06:41] I wanted to fight my battles after
[1:06:44] talking to the man he just went out of
[1:06:46] the gate
[1:06:48] when I called him he disconnected me
[1:06:52] um
[1:06:58] he told me I got that rice from Kenya
[1:07:01] and I had paid in cash now even you
[1:07:03] won't take it without paying me in cash
[1:07:11] after remembering my God I left that
[1:07:14] place I I left the manager's office and
[1:07:16] I went where The Rice was
[1:07:20] nobody's so me apart from God
[1:07:25] I knelt on the rice and I I asked God to
[1:07:29] forgive me
[1:07:33] I've troubled these men and women
[1:07:36] because for them they paid the rice
[1:07:40] for me I don't have enough money to take
[1:07:42] all this rice
[1:07:47] I claim this rice because I've already
[1:07:49] put money
[1:07:51] I don't want to live any sack of rice
[1:07:54] here
[1:07:56] but Lord trust me
[1:08:02] as I'm in your hands when I reach town I
[1:08:05] will pay them their money
[1:08:25] after coming from my prayer and then
[1:08:29] when I came the other man was on the
[1:08:31] manager's table
[1:08:33] when I went to him he was not Angry
[1:08:36] Anymore

[1:09:32] when I'm praying to God I pray with real
[1:09:35] faith
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:57] and I talked to him
[1:10:02] and then he said I've given you the rice
[1:10:05] [Applause]
[1:10:08] and he also told me that even me when I
[1:10:11] was studying I had a little money
[1:10:13] um

[1:10:19] you will not steal my mind I've given

[1:11:02] 000 and apologized and said mommy this

[1:15:57] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[1:15:59] the land and a certain man of Bethlehem
[1:16:01] Judah went to Sir John in the country of
[1:16:04] Moab he and his wife and his two sons
[1:16:06] and the name of the man was admirich and
[1:16:09] the name of the wife Naomi and the name
[1:16:11] of his two sons Marlon and Chilean
[1:16:14] ephrites of Bethlehem Judah and they
[1:16:16] came into the country of Moab and
[1:16:18] continued there and early marriage now
[1:16:20] May's husband died and she was left and
[1:16:24] he had two sons and they and they took
[1:16:26] them wives of the women of Moab the name
[1:16:29] of the one was oppa and the name of the
[1:16:32] other Ruth and they dwelled there about
[1:16:35] 10 years and macron and Chilean died
[1:16:37] also both of them and the we and the
[1:16:40] woman was left of her two sons and her
[1:16:44] husband
[1:16:45] then she arose her with her daughters in
[1:16:48] law that she might return from the
[1:16:52] country of Moab for she had had in the
[1:16:54] country or more about how that the Lord
[1:16:56] had visited his people in giving them

[1:17:03] daughters in law with her and they went
[1:17:06] on the way to return unto the land of
[1:17:08] Judah and now he said unto her two
[1:17:11] daughters in law go return each to her
[1:17:15] mother's house the Lord deal kindly with
[1:17:17] you as ye have dwelt with the dead and
[1:17:20] with me the Lord grant you that ye may
[1:17:23] find rest each of you in the house of
[1:17:25] her husband then she kissed them and
[1:17:28] they lifted up their voice and wept and
[1:17:30] they said unto her surely we will return

[1:20:12] praise the name of the Lord
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:16] now
[1:20:17] let us first introduce a bit to you
[1:20:21] this is going to be a little series now
[1:20:23] brother Barnum preached to one someone
[1:20:25] and he he went through it all
[1:20:27] together
[1:20:34] and he was dealing with the subject of
[1:20:36] the kinsman redeemer yeah
[1:20:40] and I would like to recommend each and
[1:20:43] every one of us here in your own time to
[1:20:45] please go and listen to the message the
[1:20:47] kingsman Redeemer that preached in 1960.
[1:20:56] how many will listen to it
[1:21:04] okay so those of you have not raised up
[1:21:07] your hand maybe don't want to make a
[1:21:08] commitment but I challenge you to go and
[1:21:09] try
[1:21:11] again
[1:21:14] yes I know you can read but it is
[1:21:21] don't have a way to to listen come to me
[1:21:23] I'll give you a way to be able to listen
[1:21:25] to it
[1:21:30] listen to the message
[1:21:33] in that message dealt with all that I
[1:21:36] want to preach in five Services
[1:21:40] [Music]
[1:21:50] we can take a few segments and have it
[1:21:53] in several services
[1:22:01] so today we will be dealing with the
[1:22:05] decision
[1:22:08] so now in Bethlehem of Judah or
[1:22:12] Bethlehem means the house of God is
[1:22:13] bread base
[1:22:17] and now me where with their three sons
[1:22:21] they were living in Bethlehem of Judah
[1:22:26] but because they are you know maybe for
[1:22:29] some reasons maybe because of femin or
[1:22:31] because of some issues they decided to
[1:22:32] leave their place and go tomorrow
[1:22:38] but
[1:22:41] what they found there in Moab was more
[1:22:44] than was more than famous
[1:22:49] it was real feminine it was death
[1:22:53] and you know as a Believer when you
[1:22:55] leave your God provided place
[1:23:00] when you leave your God is provided the
[1:23:03] place you died
[1:23:05] actually that means total separation
[1:23:08] with God
[1:23:11] and when a Believer lives their place
[1:23:15] you can never find peace with God
[1:23:18] With God when you leave your place
[1:23:22] you can never progress or succeed with
[1:23:25] God
[1:23:27] and His Assurance or his insurance we
[1:23:31] call it insurance but for him he calls
[1:23:32] it Assurance
[1:23:37] of success in life
[1:23:43] but if you go with God
[1:23:46] you will never fail totally the married
[1:23:48] wife you go with with God and you remain
[1:23:51] in your place
[1:23:53] you will always fulfill all your life's
[1:23:56] Endeavors
[1:23:58] and so I'm not going to give a big
[1:24:01] foundation I'm getting right into the
[1:24:02] summons I want you to be attentive and
[1:24:04] follow me
[1:24:07] foreign
[1:25:07] in the house where God was giving them
[1:25:10] bread
[1:25:11] [Music]
[1:25:13] but you know it is
[1:25:18] the way of the Cross is never easy
[1:25:22] the way of Christ is never easy
[1:25:32] it is a hard way full of squeezing did
[1:25:36] you die can you go it kind of like
[1:25:38] squeezes life out of you
[1:25:41] but you feel like you're losing your
[1:25:43] mind
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:47] things are not going according to your
[1:25:49] unnatural plan
[1:25:55] decided with their three sons
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:03] no we cannot you know hearing the
[1:26:06] message every time and here the word and
[1:26:08] you know what the past is saying no this
[1:26:10] is true no no not for us or when it is
[1:26:14] there are many people out there who are
[1:26:17] living a different lifestyle
[1:26:20] and they're happy so we can also go out
[1:26:23] there among the Pentecostals
[1:26:34] so let me go out there and live like
[1:26:38] them
[1:26:39] they decided to leave the house of God
[1:26:42] is
[1:26:56] but actually they were not happy
[1:26:59] you can never be happy when you leave
[1:27:01] the house of God is great there's so
[1:27:03] many sin you can go for them
[1:27:05] praise the name of the Lord I don't know
[1:27:08] whether it's the monster not working
[1:27:10] properly or whether brother I need more
[1:27:12] sand I can't hear myself very well and I
[1:27:15] don't want to shout so much for the
[1:27:16] people so I wanted to follow me closely
[1:27:18] here
[1:27:19] you can never find peace without God
[1:27:24] you can never progress you can never
[1:27:28] succeed let me tell you sometimes you
[1:27:31] might think let me say this if you are
[1:27:35] serpent seat
[1:27:37] no no no no no of course you will
[1:27:39] succeed with that God
[1:27:42] this morning I'm speaking today children
[1:27:45] of God
[1:27:47] do I have the seed of God here this is
[1:27:58] so I'm speaking to the seed of God this
[1:28:01] morning
[1:28:03] this sermon is not for suppancy today
[1:28:15] without being in the place that God has
[1:28:17] blessed you I told him
[1:28:19] you've lost your way
[1:28:26] and any time that a Believer gets off of
[1:28:29] his God is giving grounds
[1:28:34] and for heads up our god-given ground is
[1:28:37] the word
[1:28:40] our god-given ground is the word
[1:28:43] but anytime I believe I get stuff is
[1:28:46] god-given ground
[1:28:48] and then he says many times in politics
[1:28:52] this election coming up and so forth
[1:28:56] a good man can be a good man
[1:28:59] and he will wander off of those grounds
[1:29:04] and he will wander off into those
[1:29:06] grounds
[1:29:37] and so he says that this Minister
[1:29:39] wandered off of God's ground
[1:29:46] he said a Christian gets off of those
[1:29:49] grounds
[1:29:52] where I'll just go down tonight
[1:29:55] with the boys in the pool room
[1:30:00] I Will Do no harm
[1:30:02] I'll just take one little drink
[1:30:05] you are awful
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:31:04] you see foreign
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:05] it really types you know the blinding of
[1:32:08] the Jews
[1:32:12] but it paved away for the Gentile bride
[1:32:15] oh coming in
[1:32:19] do you understand that it also types the
[1:32:22] fall of Man
[1:32:25] that brings a savior to do the work of
[1:32:28] redemption
[1:32:30] so this story also speaks of election
[1:32:33] and Redemption
[1:32:37] I'm gonna do a lot of reading today
[1:32:39] really because I'm just giving an
[1:32:40] introductory someone for the for this
[1:32:42] series
[1:32:44] four different phrases
[1:32:47] four different phases
[1:32:50] of this Ruth
[1:32:52] [Music]
[1:32:55] says and I want to approach it from four
[1:32:57] different phases deciding
[1:33:03] Peter
[1:33:24] now she made that decision
[1:33:26] then Ruth is serving now where is that
[1:33:29] the roof is resting then the roof is
[1:33:32] rewarded and so today I'm speaking on
[1:33:35] Ruth his decision
[1:33:38] Ruth is a type of a Christianity
[1:33:42] you know the Bible is amazing
[1:33:50] and this meaning is about Christ
[1:33:55] away if you ever read anywhere in the
[1:33:58] Bible
[1:33:59] and you don't see Jesus Christ
[1:34:04] you did not read properly
[1:34:06] can you imagine to direct from the Old
[1:34:09] Testament
[1:34:10] but I'm going to preach to you Jesus
[1:34:14] because all the prophets
[1:34:17] we are testifying about Jesus
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:35:24] foreign
[1:36:03] [Applause]
[1:36:24] foreign
[1:37:19] foreign
[1:37:47] foreign
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:55] [Applause]
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:23] you are representing us
[1:38:26] you are the Ambassador we have Grandma
[1:38:29] two men
[1:38:31] you are the Ambassador we have because
[1:38:35] if you're a member of this church for
[1:38:37] example
[1:38:38] you are representing us
[1:38:45] not only being a member of a church I'm
[1:38:48] talking about being a member of the
[1:38:50] church to I am fine
[1:38:51] a member of the body of Christ
[1:38:54] I told you one time when I was in
[1:38:56] Tanzania
[1:38:58] and you know someone wanted to give me
[1:39:00] to to bring me a prostitute
[1:39:03] and you're using the language I didn't
[1:39:05] understand at first
[1:39:07] it appeared as if I had accepted
[1:39:10] and so I was young I was not married yet
[1:39:14] I think I was 17 years ago
[1:39:20] and so when I got to know what the man
[1:39:23] meant yeah foreign
[1:40:13] you are a Christian when nobody's there
[1:40:19] actually for you to know that you were a
[1:40:21] real Christian
[1:40:23] is when nobody's there to see you
[1:40:25] [Applause]
[1:40:28] brother Hashem really put that sound
[1:40:30] proper now listen he says
[1:40:34] you in your behavior
[1:40:37] in the way you act
[1:40:39] and what you do
[1:40:42] you represent the entire body of Christ
[1:40:45] now
[1:40:46] [Applause]
[1:40:49] I had only a few amendments
[1:40:52] do we believe that I read it again
[1:40:58] in your behavior
[1:41:05] represent the entire body of Christ
[1:41:09] what do you say but I'm just a limited
[1:41:18] I'm not even a promise I don't even play
[1:41:22] the piano I am just a member who comes
[1:41:24] and sips and then disappears
[1:41:28] that doesn't matter
[1:41:31] when you take on that name of Christians
[1:41:36] to represent cries
[1:41:42] amen you should live like that you
[1:41:46] should live like gentlemen like ladies
[1:41:50] don't never do things of the world
[1:42:07] no matter how weak you are foreign
[1:42:38] I think this is right next year or maybe
[1:42:40] next week I can see where I'm wrong
[1:42:46] and that's how all of us are in decision
[1:42:49] making we
[1:42:51] actually never make decisions
[1:42:54] and stick with them most of the time
[1:43:02] do you want us to use other microphones
[1:43:06] okay so it says
[1:43:09] I can see where I am wrong after making
[1:43:11] a decision last year and then next year
[1:43:13] I can see or maybe next week I can see
[1:43:15] where I am wrong
[1:43:22] but God can't yeah
[1:43:34] upon the sin to act and the way he acts
[1:43:37] on that decision that's the same way you
[1:43:40] must act every time that decision has to
[1:43:43] be made again
[1:43:53] Hallelujah man talk about stability
[1:43:57] God doesn't say oh I made a wrong
[1:43:59] decision then
[1:44:01] this time let me correct
[1:44:07] Hallelujah man what does that make me
[1:44:10] feel
[1:44:11] I know he called me he made a decision
[1:44:15] to call me
[1:44:16] the new real good yeah
[1:44:41] his decision of you as the best singer
[1:44:48] if he has ever called now if he has ever
[1:44:50] been caught on a sin he will make the
[1:44:51] same decision again
[1:44:55] because if he did not if he acts a
[1:44:58] certain way on this decision
[1:45:59] remain foreign
[1:46:08] [Applause]
[1:46:33] [Applause]
[1:46:37] foreign
[1:46:49] and that road map is
[1:46:58] but the problem is many times what God
[1:47:03] has purpose for you
[1:47:05] takes long to come into formations
[1:47:09] because you keep making wrong decisions
[1:47:18] now I understand you know the analogy
[1:47:21] that God has made a decision
[1:47:27] is Ultimate
[1:47:29] um
[1:47:41] your decisions
[1:47:45] because if you make the wrong ones
[1:47:49] foreign
[1:48:18] foreign
[1:49:18] amen
[1:49:32] us
[1:49:34] but God did make a way that a man could
[1:49:36] fellowship with him again
[1:49:39] and that man we
[1:49:43] was
[1:49:47] and that's the only way that God ever
[1:49:49] did meet man
[1:49:52] and that's the only way that God ever
[1:49:54] can meet man
[1:49:57] is
[1:50:05] the only way that God can meet us is
[1:50:07] under the shed blood of Jesus Christ now
[1:50:16] the way God acted or his mechanism of
[1:50:18] making decisions in the first place is
[1:50:20] always right
[1:50:26] into many people trust many things
[1:50:30] that's why I believe I must always trust
[1:50:33] God
[1:50:35] many many people Trust Systems
[1:50:40] and Society
[1:50:50] his trust is always in God
[1:50:54] for their lives
[1:51:00] I see impossibilities
[1:51:33] therefore we can predict God knowing
[1:51:36] when I was writing this I was writing it
[1:51:38] by inspiration I was like ah we can
[1:51:40] predict God whenever
[1:51:47] knowing what will happen when we do what
[1:51:52] foreign
[1:52:46] foreign
[1:53:16] foreign
[1:54:36] you will do the same thing he did in the
[1:54:39] past
[1:54:46] hallelujah amen so what he did before to
[1:54:49] others
[1:54:51] he will do to us
[1:54:54] we made the same condition
[1:54:58] those people met
[1:55:00] us yes
[1:55:19] Hallelujah I mean you can never say that
[1:55:22] was rude
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:28] what he did for them he will do for you
[1:55:33] if you do what does people think
[1:55:37] what did Ruth do
[1:55:39] the first thing
[1:55:42] who's decided
[1:55:46] hallelujah amen he is the same God and
[1:55:51] he never changes
[1:55:53] we always have to make decisions after
[1:55:55] being inspired right
[1:56:02] hallelujah amen that's why he gives us
[1:56:05] his word to inspire us the right way
[1:56:08] too so that we can make the right
[1:56:10] decisions that's why we come to church
[1:56:18] foreign
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:09] so she was like foreign
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:21] Hallelujah
[1:59:21] amen
[1:59:30] you feel life already over them you feel
[1:59:32] life how many feet
[1:59:37] what is that checho that is the seed of
[1:59:40] God in you yes
[2:00:05] on Tuesday Wednesday
[2:00:12] because we are living in Two Worlds at
[2:00:15] the same time
[2:00:17] that's why I believe you must keep
[2:00:21] yourself under the altar foreign
[2:00:43] foreign
[2:01:32] if you have a preacher and you tell them
[2:01:34] that's the first thing
[2:01:38] that's the first thing
[2:01:42] the first thing takes in natural
[2:01:43] marriage is
[2:01:45] a decision has to be made
[2:01:48] the young lady has to make her decision
[2:01:52] so even a young lady makes a decision in
[2:01:54] a marriage
[2:01:58] the young lady has to make a decision
[2:02:01] whether she wants this young man
[2:02:04] and whether the young man whether he
[2:02:06] wants this young woman
[2:02:08] there has to be a decision made
[2:02:11] and he says and you have to make it he
[2:02:14] says and you have to make it
[2:02:18] makes it for you
[2:02:20] you make it go away now so this portion
[2:02:23] goes to the unmarried
[2:02:27] especially those who are planning to get
[2:02:28] married
[2:02:30] you make that decision she must be the
[2:02:34] only woman in the world
[2:02:41] and he must be the only man that you
[2:02:44] love
[2:02:46] if it is
[2:02:54] people think that it is emotion and
[2:02:56] feelings
[2:02:59] that's not what we're talking about
[2:03:01] love is subjective
[2:03:05] doesn't have God in it
[2:03:08] it's not true love
[2:03:11] that is
[2:03:22] just to say if you love an unbeliever
[2:03:26] it is most likely that that's not true
[2:03:31] because it was not inspired right
[2:03:37] so it must be a true love
[2:03:41] foreign
[2:04:46] rest of my life
[2:04:50] whether to serve God and to take him as
[2:04:52] yourself
[2:04:55] you see it's not only taking him as a
[2:04:56] savior it's also serving him
[2:05:00] being an ambassador
[2:05:02] back away
[2:05:07] are you going to serve the world
[2:05:10] are you going to serve Christ oh now it
[2:05:13] is you have to make up your
[2:05:16] minds of you there has to be a decision
[2:05:19] man
[2:05:20] when you make up your mind
[2:05:23] are going to serve God to gain away with
[2:05:26] the cartoon oh you're going to serve
[2:05:28] mammals
[2:05:29] then you take your choice
[2:05:32] but the decision has to be made
[2:05:36] Hallelujah man when I was 13 years
[2:05:44] that's why every a decision I met
[2:05:47] I decided to filter it through the
[2:05:50] choice
[2:05:55] if I'm going to get a job
[2:05:58] my first question is
[2:06:07] foreign
[2:06:31] testimony and I'm like I don't know what
[2:06:33] my wife will think but but she said
[2:06:38] I don't know what you were thinking
[2:06:41] part of our courtship
[2:06:48] we never talked about you know sexual
[2:06:51] stuff
[2:06:57] but did you really love me from the
[2:06:59] beginning
[2:07:02] but I thought I wanted to be sure
[2:07:05] I was making the right choice
[2:07:10] you are going to be the woman that I
[2:07:12] want to marry your mother for my
[2:07:14] children
[2:07:17] and I could not have been sure when I
[2:07:20] went into love stories
[2:07:28] foreign
[2:08:01] how can you love somebody don't know
[2:08:07] you have to love somebody that you know
[2:08:11] love comes out of a relationship
[2:08:14] Hallelujah
[2:08:16] love comes out of knowledge
[2:08:19] love comes out of Revelation
[2:08:23] Revelation is
[2:08:33] this much
[2:08:37] I am making 10 years in marriage
[2:08:42] can you believe that um
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:53] foreign
[2:08:58] [Music]
[2:09:52] advising you today
[2:09:55] don't rush
[2:09:58] actually younger girl
[2:10:00] if a brother
[2:10:03] and begins telling you how beautiful
[2:10:08] and how they love you so much
[2:10:10] and how they can sleep
[2:10:14] most likely that is
[2:10:19] in the first week
[2:10:21] how possible
[2:10:25] something wrong you see that it comes
[2:10:29] out of a relationship
[2:10:30] you are not marrying a feeling
[2:10:35] remember this is someone who has been
[2:10:37] raised by somebody else
[2:10:44] you believe maybe there's different
[2:10:46] things
[2:11:05] what's up
[2:11:08] no Amen on that
[2:11:10] it's your it's a lifetime companion
[2:11:16] you've man up your mind
[2:11:21] before you go into love things
[2:11:25] begin with finding out who they are
[2:11:36] what do they intend to do in life
[2:11:40] let me go back to myself and then after
[2:11:43] the decision is
[2:11:52] praise the name of the Lord
[2:11:54] you've got to make an engagement before
[2:11:56] this Union can be
[2:12:00] and that's the way it is with crisis
[2:12:02] Church
[2:12:04] it has to be an engagement with Christ
[2:12:08] I pledge
[2:12:17] oh the message is sweet tonight you must
[2:12:19] have a love affair with Jesus
[2:12:25] hallelujah amen love is the best thing
[2:12:29] in the world see
[2:12:33] of course if you don't you don't love or
[2:12:35] if you've not Been Loved Before You
[2:12:36] Can't Understand
[2:12:49] and the prophet is telling us
[2:12:54] it's a love affair with him
[2:12:56] and then the next thing is promises
[2:13:04] like that you make promise
[2:13:07] sweetheart you will marry me
[2:13:09] I promise I'll be the lawyer and I'll be
[2:13:12] loyal and true
[2:13:13] I will look upon no other woman
[2:13:15] I look upon and the woman
[2:13:20] and I will do all that his duty as a
[2:13:22] duty as a wife
[2:13:24] we have children
[2:13:26] I will do it as a duty as a mother
[2:13:30] housekeeper all these promises us to God
[2:13:34] to be married
[2:13:40] and that's the same thing when you come
[2:13:42] to Christ
[2:13:46] if you will receive me
[2:13:49] I promise
[2:13:52] I will love you I'll be true
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:51] so what what you've promised Jesus
[2:14:53] Christ
[2:14:59] why would it be so easy for you to take
[2:15:01] a job that gives you 5 million a month
[2:15:04] and yet you know you're not going to
[2:15:06] attend any services
[2:15:20] uh with going to church
[2:15:26] am I preaching to someone
[2:15:29] you only stream okay if you're far away
[2:15:35] and maybe your quota
[2:15:37] um
[2:15:38] but streaming cannot be replaced
[2:15:43] with going to church
[2:15:49] streaming the services
[2:15:58] [Music]
[2:16:28] I think I'll finish with this quote as I
[2:16:31] feel as I'm still in the same court but
[2:16:32] let me read on down a few more minutes
[2:16:34] it says look here if you haven't got
[2:16:37] teeth
[2:16:38] and you use false teeth no and you use
[2:16:42] false teeth
[2:16:44] now that's all right but it's
[2:16:47] substituting for teeth that you was hard
[2:16:50] it is substituting for this you are for
[2:16:53] the teeth you once had
[2:16:55] um
[2:17:02] but actually those teeth are not
[2:17:05] connected with you
[2:17:12] how many of you here have mechanical
[2:17:15] teeth
[2:17:16] nobody yeah
[2:17:22] all of you have no motives
[2:17:31] listen who did that you see but it says
[2:17:35] if of course not they already had they
[2:17:37] already saw where I was going so they
[2:17:38] didn't want to claim that yeah
[2:17:42] but actually those trees are not
[2:17:44] connected with you
[2:17:47] it's not a part of you
[2:17:50] if you had an arm amputated
[2:17:54] and you put a false armor no take a
[2:17:57] cookware that arm is actually not
[2:17:58] connected with you
[2:18:04] it's not connected with you
[2:18:07] and when we take our pledge to Christ
[2:18:11] if we don't become a part of him
[2:18:15] like a woman all to become a part of a
[2:18:18] man and a man a part of the woman then
[2:18:19] we are an artificial Christians
[2:18:33] foreign
[2:19:33] foreign
[2:20:33] a
[2:20:34] D Catholic Muslim
[2:20:38] but really because their father was
[2:20:46] but you're not that 38 oh come on you're
[2:20:49] not that it's a security you're just a
[2:20:52] denominational child but
[2:20:56] but God wants to make you his child
[2:20:59] away he wants to be connected with you
[2:21:03] and you do that only by believing the
[2:21:05] word
[2:21:07] you repent of your sins you accept
[2:21:11] Christ as your personal sins
[2:21:16] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:21:20] the Forgiveness of sins and then you
[2:21:23] were given the Holy Spirit and then the
[2:21:25] Journey Begins
[2:21:35] if the woman isn't connected with a man
[2:21:37] in trueness
[2:21:40] then it is at her husband
[2:21:43] is just a man she's taking a vote to
[2:21:46] live with oh yeah
[2:21:51] she played to love him she said she
[2:21:55] loved him but
[2:22:06] if a man you want to know that you you
[2:22:09] married the right woman
[2:22:12] this is a woman who must be willing
[2:22:18] to give her entire life to you
[2:22:22] to some extent I felt that women may be
[2:22:25] loved more than men
[2:22:35] [Music]
[2:22:43] foreign
[2:23:31] now that's true
[2:23:35] and when you do that right decisions
[2:23:41] praise the name of the Lord
[2:23:44] praise the name of the Lord
[2:23:54] if the woman isn't connected with the
[2:23:55] man in trueness
[2:23:59] then it is
[2:24:01] just a man she's taking a vow to live
[2:24:04] with
[2:24:08] champ like to love him and she said she
[2:24:12] loved him
[2:24:17] all the time the man is deceived
[2:24:22] if she doesn't does what she promised
[2:24:24] all the time
[2:24:29] if the woman doesn't do it all the time
[2:24:36] there is one thing sure friends
[2:24:40] are you ready for this
[2:24:42] we are not going to deceive Christ
[2:24:46] he knows his own
[2:24:50] Hallelujah man but you see first
[2:24:52] decisions
[2:25:05] Hallelujah
[2:25:17] okay I'm just right on my time here
[2:25:20] I wanted to finish that quote but
[2:25:23] there is another portion I know you
[2:25:25] promised me that you are going to listen
[2:25:27] to the kinsman redeemer
[2:25:29] this is
[2:25:33] who did not raise up their hand let me
[2:25:35] read you this portion also and getting
[2:25:36] towards America and then we'll Brothers
[2:25:40] prepare to sing the song I would like us
[2:25:42] to sing the song all the way
[2:25:46] now there's this portion in in the
[2:25:49] Kingdom Matthew you can give us that
[2:25:54] says but oh how I like that little Ruth
[2:25:59] she had to make a decision
[2:26:01] I had to make a decision you've got to
[2:26:05] make a decision you will never work out
[2:26:07] those these doors this morning
[2:26:11] without some kind of decision
[2:26:17] let me let that sink
[2:26:20] you will not leave this room
[2:26:24] today either being a better man or a
[2:26:28] woman or a worse man or a woman
[2:26:32] Obama said
[2:26:35] as I was reading this I thought the Holy
[2:26:37] Spirit just spoke to me and said
[2:26:40] that happens every Saturday
[2:26:45] whenever anybody doesn't matter who
[2:26:48] singsongani if you walk into the church
[2:26:52] where the true word of God is preached
[2:26:55] you walk out better or worse than you oh
[2:26:58] follow me
[2:27:01] he says you to reject it you will be
[2:27:04] worse
[2:27:07] it will be harder the next time
[2:27:11] for you to get to it
[2:27:13] or you will go out better
[2:27:17] it becomes a showdown in her life
[2:27:21] it comes a showdown in everybody's life
[2:27:25] and Ruth how to make a decision
[2:27:28] does the Bible says
[2:27:36] go back to your denomination go back to
[2:27:40] your sin the area of the video go back
[2:27:42] to the lukewarm you know go back like
[2:27:44] the lukewarm did die young foreign
[2:28:36] young people who are here did you know
[2:28:37] that
[2:28:41] some of you didn't know that um
[2:28:46] churches are communities which I accept
[2:28:48] everybody foreign
[2:28:50] [Music]
[2:29:16] [Music]
[2:29:51] I am convinced it's the truth
[2:30:16] is that we made it
[2:30:21] good day I'm looking forward to that
[2:30:24] means but don't you worry while we're
[2:30:26] here we are struggling
[2:30:32] two hours three hours oh I am thankful
[2:30:36] I'm not a long preacher but
[2:30:38] I'm also struggling to become a one-hour
[2:30:41] preacher
[2:30:43] we should preach for 40 minutes
[2:30:47] but why do we do sometimes two hours
[2:30:50] three hours
[2:30:51] because we are struggling
[2:30:54] the world is giving us more than three
[2:30:57] hours out there
[2:31:00] movies one hour and a half three two
[2:31:02] three minutes
[2:31:11] the devil keeps you entertained
[2:31:15] the First Book Festival where are you
[2:31:18] scroll and scroll down
[2:31:20] I deleted that thing on my phone
[2:31:24] I don't need VPN so I got a VPN I
[2:31:27] deleted it because the thing was making
[2:31:29] me busy
[2:31:34] even you lose your time
[2:31:37] and now on Twitter
[2:31:43] they are the ones who decide for you
[2:31:45] what to see
[2:31:46] so you will receive videos
[2:31:48] [Music]
[2:32:00] oh goodness the devil has made sure he
[2:32:05] has kept us busy at whatever you
[2:32:07] couldn't entertain yourself but we don't
[2:32:10] have time for church anymore
[2:32:13] oh God help us but what do we need today
[2:32:18] that's why sometimes when we come to
[2:32:20] church I have to tell you this sometimes
[2:32:24] as a preacher you say Lord I want to
[2:32:27] just speak for 40 minutes
[2:32:29] normally a person does not listen for
[2:32:32] more than that and you know they're
[2:32:33] getting tired
[2:32:37] you made your decision
[2:32:39] but holy spirit says
[2:32:44] maybe there was somebody that needed it
[2:32:49] foreign
[2:33:27] it's not about TV
[2:33:31] that's why as Believers we hate that
[2:33:35] thing
[2:33:36] we heard it we don't like it it's not
[2:33:39] about TV
[2:33:42] done to me there's nothing wrong with it
[2:33:45] what they're offering me what they're
[2:33:49] offering my babies
[2:33:51] dressed naked everywhere
[2:33:54] they flip channels but you said Channel
[2:33:57] things that are rated for uh for a
[2:33:59] six-year-old
[2:34:01] you find that stuff that is
[2:34:17] our children we have to make such
[2:34:20] decisions
[2:34:21] when my wife and I got married
[2:34:24] we went to Nairobi
[2:34:27] there was a brother who had a TV
[2:34:28] broadcast
[2:34:30] TV programs very nice program no no I
[2:34:34] went to Nigeria and I just want another
[2:34:36] Pastor who had a TV of his own almost
[2:34:41] very good programs I came back I said to
[2:34:44] my wife I think we can benefit from one
[2:34:48] we agreed so we vote I think it is
[2:34:57] put the dish up on our house
[2:34:59] and we were enjoying it at first we were
[2:35:03] enjoying them the programs
[2:35:08] and then you know the other program in
[2:35:11] Nairobi programs in Nairobi and then
[2:35:12] slowly by slowly
[2:35:14] slowly the other programs
[2:35:21] and then one day we noticed we started
[2:35:25] going to church late
[2:35:37] a believer
[2:35:42] [Music]
[2:36:00] [Music]
[2:36:22] thank you foreign
[2:36:40] thank you
[2:36:42] I went to Kenya I went to Ethiopia
[2:36:45] Ethiopia on a trip and we're praying and
[2:36:50] the Holy Spirit spoke to me directly
[2:36:52] when you go back home
[2:36:59] foreign
[2:37:15] [Applause]
[2:38:02] you don't need a TV to watch news
[2:38:07] foreign
[2:38:17] they are all evils
[2:38:18] this one is even worse than a TV
[2:38:23] but at least you have a level of control
[2:38:27] you can tell them I don't want to see
[2:38:29] this
[2:38:30] whatever it's about this block
[2:38:33] if you watch bad stuff on your phone
[2:38:35] you're about to begin with yourself
[2:38:41] but friends I am so thankful neighbors
[2:38:45] by the time my children came in my home
[2:38:47] I didn't have zuku influencing them
[2:38:51] the decisions
[2:38:59] am I preaching to believe us today
[2:39:09] come on
[2:39:12] let us stand as I read this other
[2:39:14] portions
[2:39:18] says Ruth said I will go where you go
[2:39:21] again your people who will be my people
[2:39:25] are going to be my God
[2:39:29] I will die
[2:39:33] that's a real decision
[2:39:36] Lord I'll take you as my savior
[2:39:39] if the Bible says repent and be baptized
[2:39:41] in the name of our Jesus in the name of
[2:39:43] Jesus Christ
[2:39:48] if the Bible said I must receive the
[2:39:50] holy ghosts
[2:39:54] if the Bible tells me Jesus Christ is
[2:39:56] the same yesterday done forever
[2:40:01] I will take the Bible on God
[2:40:04] for what he has written
[2:40:07] what he is Cherry no matter what anybody
[2:40:10] else
[2:40:12] prayer is the real truth
[2:40:15] that's the real Ruth
[2:40:18] foreign
[2:40:32] go back
[2:40:34] or go forward
[2:40:37] but the prophet says don't never go back
[2:40:43] let's go forward
[2:40:46] how many want to go forward
