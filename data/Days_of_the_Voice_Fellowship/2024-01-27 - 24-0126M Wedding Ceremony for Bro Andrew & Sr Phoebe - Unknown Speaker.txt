to the platform where everybody can see [Music] them [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] fore [Music] you may be [Music] seated dearly beloved we are here together in the sight of God and in the presence of these witnesses to to join together Baka Andrew in the bonds of holy matrimony according to the ordinance of God the custom of the Christian church and the laws of this nation and we are also here to implore on their behalf the blessing of God [Music] except the Lord build the house they in vain that build [Music] it marriage is Honorable and holy EST instituted by God In The Garden of Aiden it was there that the Lord God [Music] said it is not good that the man should be alone Eve was then fashioned from a reib of Adam and given to him for a wife and it was thus recorded therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh [Music] it is sanctioned and and honored by Jesus's Christ's Presence at the marriage in K of Galilee which exists between Christ and his his church God ordains it as the foundation and bond of family life for the mutual help and comfort of husband and wife and for the welfare of the State marriage there is not to be entered upon by any inadvisably or lightly but reverently discreetly the fear of God into this holy estate these two persons now desire to enter by being joined together as one [Music] and there before we continue If any man can show any just cause why these two may not lawfully be joined together let him now declare it the heart of now is pumping and under so there is no one praise the Lord and if there is any you should forever hold your peace moreover I charge you both Andrew and fibbe before God the searer of all hearts if either of you know of any impediment why you may not LLY be United in marriage you do not confess it for be assur that you will surely answer the day of judgment when the secrets of All Hearts shall Beed if there is any of you with that knows of any impediment why you should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony be also assured that so many as are joined together otherwise God word they are not United by the Lord we are talking about and things like that we believe this is the right way and and those who are united otherwise by and their marriage is not blessed by him and so uh I'm going to go into a few scriptures and sharing uh after that little introduction and uh after that we shall do the vows and then the signing of the agreements the prayer and then we shall dismiss thereafter so we are not going to be very long before we go to the scriptures I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome everyone this is days of the voice Fellowship of The Voice fellowship and uh we've been here for about two years in this place this is the second year here in this location and also I'm happy to announce that Andrew and phi's wedding is our first in this [Music] Fellowship so it is a clear sign that we are now becoming fruitful and that they opening the door for that for that being fruitful it's a clear sign that they themselves will also be fruitful in their marriage praise the Lord and so uh we have different ones gathered here today family members Friends of the ones that are going to be weed today we take this opportunity to welcome you all specifically I'd like to honor the presence of honorable Baka right over here uh do you come with your wife sir yes God bless you is one of our Member of Parliament the country and as well as the uncle of Andrew so we are happy that we are here like we speak in our usual language we have to conclud today Hallelujah we were at the reception the introduction ceremony Andor received us very well and uh you know gave us officially gave us phibe officially after Andrew has had fulfilled all the requirements that he had requested of him and we ate a lot ofo there and uh and also the M I love the way they do the m L very wonderful I would like to appreciate your wife God bless you so much for your wonderful reception and so now we will go to the word a little bit and then after the vows this is mainly for you phbe and you Andrew and I'd like you to pay attention uh on this part so let us pray first our loving Jesus we would like to thank you so much today for this opportunity that you have given us to be here today to be able to join together brother Andrew and and and his wife to be sister [Music] phbe we appreciate you Lord for the time that you have kept them while they have been single and they have loved you and served you and that's the reason why in you they have been able to find each other and now we ask Lord as we are going to share the word give us a good atmosphere for them to receive and also the people that have come that will be able to receive the word we all this is happening because of your word Lord and we want to honor it and want to ask that you will come and take the preeminence Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen so now to many of you that know me I'm a I'm I'm Evangelistic in my way of delivery and preaching and uh so evangelist kind of tend to talk fast and sharp words and things like that but uh today I'll try to put myself together and and be a bit religious and so I have a a lot of I have my my notes written down and I'll try to stick with them so I don't lose the thought where the the Lord gives me a little inspiration then that will be for the benefit of the people that are here so I also appreciate our brother Jon and the church at evening light bright Tabernacle uh that actually raised sister fibbe and now we are snatching her away from there to days of the voice Fellowship but still here at the altar we are together with evening light do you apprciate them amen we are going to begin with Hebrews 13:4 and what I'm speaking on today to you brother Andrew and sister fibbe is the basis of marriage I would be about 20 30 minutes but because of an interpreter maybe it will extend a bit but you bear with [Music] us so the scripture says marriage is Honorable in all and B and defiled but warong and adulterers God will judge also in 1 Corinthians 138 it says charity never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away and I realized I introduced everybody else but I did not introduce myself my name is Pastor the past of days of The Voice [Music] fellow and so I'm going to divide this thought into two [Music] points and in form of questions number one What is marriage number two what is the basis of marriage so now I'll begin with the first one What is marriage it is more marriage is more important important than any other relationship except your relationship to Jesus Christ it is more important than your relationship with your parents than your in-laws it is even more important than the relationship with your pastor your brothers and your sister even than the one with your boss and many other relationships that you have it is more important than a vow it is deeper than just cohabitation it is richer than just a physical relationship alone on Earth that it is unlike any other [Music] relationship sister phib you've been in many relationships meaning you have many relationships your father your P your your sisters your brothers your friends same with you your pastor your friends your is all these are relationship but marriage the marriage relationship you entering into it is higher than any relationship you have ever been in all those relationships fail relationship even this one can fail it fails many times but it is the most crucial one that you will ever be a part of it is not just a vow many people take a vow but in The Vow in itself is not staying power it is only obligation Real Marriage goes well beyond the vow there is great power in marage for a man to be complete for a man to be fulfilled you were not complete brother now you are going to be complete now you're going to be fulfilled at first you were not you were not even settled you are now going to be complete fulfilled that's the power in marriage in Genesis 2:18 and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him and help me for [Music] him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fall of the air and to every beast of the field and for Adam there was no was not found and help M for him I want you to notice that there is no help meat to be found among at men that seem more Charmed with hunting with farming even with they call it Safari [Music] tours wife in Genesis 28 the Amplified version he [Music] says now the Lord God say it is not good meaning it is not sufficient not satisfactory that the man should be alone I will make him a helper meat or suitable aded complimentary for him when the two enter into this marriage Union on a right basis it is a fulfillment of life's purpose both for the man and for the woman your life's purpose is being fulfilled to today that means if you're not married you have not yet fulfilled it outside this the union will always be lacking and eventually cannot stand you must you must enter into marriage on the right basis the Bible refers to her as a [Music] helpmate she can comfort you like no other can the very first time a man takes her or you will take her to your bosom she Lees a spiritual imprint that no other can f that place her trust is to be treasured you must treasure weakness is to be respected her giving of herself is to be honored is to be honored her submission is to be cherished her obedience is to be adored there is great power in marriage for a wife to minister to her husband Proverbs 3110 says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her [Music] so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her [Music] life here when he says he shall have no need of spoil I want you to listen to this brother and brother spoil gain which is acud from your industrious ways that you have the potential to make him Rich that's what a virtuous woman does anyone here that married a virtuous woman you can tell that since the day you got married it has been increase after increase a virtuous woman will make a man Rich a woman who is not virtuous Will Make A Man [Music] Poor if a man has found a true wife God has given him the second greatest gift that a man could receive the first is salvation and God gave you the first brother Andrew now today God is giving you the second best gift that he has and that is a virtuous woman she is to be treated as such she is to be treasured above all all natural things above all your other accomplishments that's why we believe that a woman should never be beaten like a as if you're beating a dog matter of fact a man that beats his wife is not fit to be called a man and thank God for this message because in our church I've never even heard of any brother beating his wife brother Andre you have never heard me beating my wife if you come at my home when we don't know that you are around you will hear sweet sounds only you not because she's virtuous you treat her as such the only things to be valued in your life the only thing to be valued in your life apart apart from your [Applause] wife Sal itself amen it is salvation that Jesus Christ gave you then your wife and then everybody else can follow not your father not your uncle not your brother not even your children your she's a treasure and that's what marriage is and I want to talk to you now what's the basis of marriage in the next few moments second Corinthians 11:2 Paul would say for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chest virgin to [Music] Christ there is something about chin virtue we're going to talk about that briefly let us first read Ephesians [Music] 5:2 husbands love your wives even as also Christ loved the church and he gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleans it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself our glorious church so he chooses because the church is a wife we are the bride and Jesus Christ is our husband but he chooses us and then he nourishes us character within us to be a glorious Church God has given you a raw material she's not perfect there's no perfect marriage you mold it and make it perfect by your it is only the two of you and Jesus Christ you should be the one in this circle I'm talking about the best of marriage let me come now that he may presented to himself a glorious child church not having sport or wrinkle such should be holy and without blemish I always say if you see there is a problem with a woman in marriage the problem began with with a husband if you say your H your wife is bad it means you are also bad remember she's your reib she's a part of you when you say it means you also that same so so old men to love their wives as their own bodies amen and all of you who are married you must love your wives as your own bodies you know brother Andre that this is your [Applause] body It's actually an extension of you she was only lost in's house but you you found her and you are claiming at yourself he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it even as the Lord the church so we are members of his body we are members of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother for what cause for this cause which we have talked about that is a part of you then shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they to shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church so we've talked about love before we talked about love talked about [Music] virtue and I want to talk a little bit about virtue and then I continue here for a few [Music] more there are I've been talking to him mostly so I'll turn [Music] this there is nothing in the world like a woman a woman is special many females there's a female cow female fale and they all you know reproduce and you know in all the Creations God created there is nothing like a woman why God has given a woman three saes should never defile and these are number one sacred Womanhood what does that mean conduct around men the way she presents herself to others the way she dresses that is why on the wedding on every wedding day a real bride will cover herself like a sister has done she will be dressed in the real gown not the ones they're wearing today can you imagine they're wearing half gos the boobs is out the feet is out a woman's conduct before men the way she presents her body the way she dresses you know is a sacred virtue God has given to her and brother Andre I want to tell you seen sister f she has that Sac virtue of Womanhood but you see what do men these days look for what are they looking for they look for sex Queens someone who knows how to grow long nails and then paint them and then have those high heels and have a Min and they do and and show they say show what this they call it what they call it it is a church yes but I'll say because I have many young people here they call it Nash my brother here looked at me said oh Pastor you're going to say don't say [Music] it and younger men be looking for that those kind of things that kind of woman cannot make a good [Applause] wife you want a good wife look for one with sacred Womanhood who knows what it means to be a woman who knows how to cover herself up who knows how to keep herself as a daughter of God that's what man a good man should be looking for praise the name of the Lord and I'm sure sister phbe I've seen you dress I've seen you behave you find men out there at the places of they just behave anyhow around women especially women like you who are working class you know you you really married one who she has even a PhD rather UC but still she's has that Sac virtue of Womanhood not going around where you are working at and you're allowing men to just around with you if you have sa Womanhood you cannot allow a woman a man who is not your husband to touch you woman you wait a moment this belongs to my husband I hope you women will say Amen to that sister this body is it was the Lord is but now you are married now from today going to be your so after marriage Don't Say No No don't touch me for after to date is for your husband [Music] praise the Lord amen then comes the second virtue motherhood the way she h a husband by accepting to take the seed and giving him children raising them and respecting and submitting to him we don't have many mothers like that anymore but thank God we can stand here today and say we still have some true mothers if you're a true mother here shout amen so they can know you are there I wish I had time I would expound on each but I don't want to make it a preach a preachy I want this is a ceremony quickly go go on to make my points virtue virtue for a woman to be a virgin God has given these virtues she of them any of them to tell her husband before they married she would have to you know my dear you know some years ago something happened you have to say it according to the Bible if you don't say it and the man finds out later he has a right to put you away but these days these sacred virtues are no longer cherished in churches because the churches themselves are Backle it's more about making money is more about getting members instead of getting Souls that are going to be prepared for the coming of the Lord but I tell you if you want to see that a church is back look at the women in the church how they present themselves how they dress how they behave how they behave with boys around spiritually it will be the same thing but God still has Witnesses in Uganda and in many other parts of the world where churches will preach the truth and women will behave in the right way if you say that women can no longer marry when they still virgins what did you say Pastor yes we have heard of Our Testimony and this to say [Music] public but to ask Believers it is something to brag about young man it is something to brag about for you say I will I will abstain until marriage marriage is not a curse it is a blessing butter and warong us God will judge let me not become an evangelist now the union between a man and a woman is a great mystery in of God be one with us the basis of his intention for the human race is love say love Andre say his way of saying love is the [Music] best praise the name of the Lord John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son his his basis of intention has been love he proved this love with the ultimate price his life like Christ two adults don't miss this brother Andrew two can only have a successful marriage sister phbe if true love is the basis of that marriage Peter thought and I'm heading to the climax now Peter thought he had love for Jesus but in a moment that love disappear you all remember when Peter said when all the others you I will not forsake you I will be with you I'll go with you all the way and then a little girl came and said I saw you with this man said what you talking about me I don't know the man not me I've never seen the man this is the same man Peter who had said Jesus I love you I will be with you Victor this is what boys this is what boys tells tell girls what kind of love is that that is not true love that is human love what Peter had for Jesus it is genuine humanly speaking is genuine but when he was tested that love could not stand and listen our marriage as Believers is not on the basis of that kind of love because that kind of love will fail but wait when Peter received the Holy Spirit on the Pentecost people came and they found Peter and the rest of the others even Mary the mother of Jesus they were speaking in [Music] Tong what what are you doing you're speaking in Tong and they looked at them and said they are drunk in the morning here is a man who was fearful in the beginning Peter who thought he loved Jesus in the beginning but now now when he was faced with opposition before more than 3,000 people before them now he was filled the power of the Holy Spirit he looked at them and said say in the book of Acts chapter 2 Men and brethren we are not drunk with wine but we are drunk with the spirit he said we are drunk with the spirit is that which was spoken by Prophet Jo that power out my spirit upon All Flesh son and your daughters shall prophesy as Peter was speaking he was speaking boldly he was charged up jumping up and down shouting on top of his voice excited like any drun you know but this time not with what Al [Music] not but he was drunk with the spirit Hallelujah amen now Peter the other people told him men andren what shall we do and Peter drunk by the spirit he spoke to each and every one of check it in your Bible 2: he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and shall receive the Holy Spirit why he gave them a formula of receiving the Holy Spirit now why am I talking about that Peter before he received the Holy Spirit he thought he had love but that love was human love and it failed it failed him can you imagine I will love you until until until but all those things fail don't they say those things and they fail but wait when Peter the Holy Spirit had come upon him when he he didn't fail he F in his that great love and said because I love Jesus with all my heart I'll not I'll not let him down let me stand before these people and speak about Jesus and he spoke about Jesus where did he get the B from the right kind of love the right kind of love my brother Andrew sister comes from the Holy Spirit if you don't have the Holy Spirit canot have the right perfect kind of love those who believe it can say Amen so what does that mean there is no constancy in it [Music] from the day Peter received the Holy Spirit never denied Jesus Christ he demonstrated his love for him all [Music] through he has received the Holy Spirit which is the true basis of love this is the true foundation sister upon which any relationship any strong marriage Union can be built that is the B and how do you receive the Holy Spirit one thing you repent and I'm sure I was there when you were repenting brother Andre you told me you repented what is repentance forsaking all else forsaking the world the pride of life forsaking the the lust of the eyes forsaking the lust of the flesh that's repentance from today I've decided to follow Jesus Christ that's repentance the second thing is being baptized in much water not just in much water because many people can be baptized like that according to this Bible you have to be baptized in much water in the name of the Lord Jesus and once that is Happ happen then God forgives all your sins and he gives you the Holy Spirit now these two people went through that process and they are on the right basis of marriage today First Corinthians 13 as I'm finishing charity suffereth long is kind charity enth not that's not true love he's talking about true love love is not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly Seth not her own is not easily provoked think no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth all things all things all things all things love never and because you on the right basis Andrew and phib I can stand here today and deare to your relatives and everybody who is here today that your marriage is on the right basis and your marriage will not fail your love Cann fail hallelujah amen it will not fail prophecy will fail will fail knowledge will cease but this love will not fa the devil has intended intended to pervert love what is true love God is love love that's what they have love of God but the devil wants to pervert it to to pervert it he brings it down reduces it do you love her even when I think about her electricity goes through [Music] M that can fail next time in the morning when she wakes up and she has aot [Music] of I Don't Love by the way I thought because it was human love and then from f it reduces down to last those are are people who whoever they see for them and they call it love I love you it is just last and then from there it goes down to F and perversion that's where you find a man saying he's going to marry a man a woman saying he going to marry and they say they love each other that is the devil's perversion of love God who is rich in Mercy still has his own who will not base their marriage on anything else perfect love Hallelujah and upon this Believers Mar on thisis ofs MAR no circumstance unbeliever because there is no love in between if they have no God in them my sister phib may God who has given you that perfect love may he give you Revelation for these words love obey Andrew Andrew you need to trust in God to find his intentions when he said love cherish Nish to give yourself and as you make the VES you're going to make don't blindly say the words don't say the words blindly silently pray that God will make those words real to you together SE search out the answer for what it really means May the Almighty God the of every good gift may he Grant you a wonderful marriage on the basis of true love God bless you both and I'll ask you to come and stand we go to the next session if you come can come stand for me the meton if you want to help out my musicians do you have [Music] something see
