we read that now we are sons of lords praise be to god come here we shall not be the truth or we will be over but where we have read what you show me [Applause] amen and this is what we have to know that we [Applause] [Applause] here [Applause] praise [Applause] amen but god has preserved us for this time oh come here and what we need to know what is going to keep us going is knowing that we have an identity that we belong to god the truth that we have about god who has never left us who has given us the holy spirit blessed be the name of the lord amen i mean well we read in hebrews chapter 10 where christian name of abraham yesterday verses uh 23. he says let us only first the profession of our faith argument [Applause] let us hold the first profession of our faith for faith without wavering because he who promised us is faithful amen nina where [Applause] so the promise looked like it turned may abraham you are the covenant people of god movement god took christ apart at calvary swearing by himself [Applause] holy spirit god is not leading he's not making men to lead his church amen by the holy spirit he's [Applause] [Applause] we need that quickening power we should make this world active in our lives the promises of god in action i cannot take it amen so that same speech that god sent it back to leave the church the same life that was in christ jesus is in the church

just a moment i just want to greet you all in the precious name of jesus christ i did not expect that i would make it to church today no but also they i was we had four days of meetings and i thought initially that i had a backup plan i thought that brother elder brother charles of mata would be helping me as a pastor from sorority but we we had our first service in morocco and the reception was really nice abandoned and so after the preaching we had agreed with the past that you will be taking we will be alternating the services either i take morning it takes afternoon i check afternoon next morning so for uh meetings sometimes [Music] as i will show you on sunday i will give you a full report on something every day uh at one time we had a a little more than 500 people gathered in the same place world war ii and we gave out messages the brothers they took with me helped me to distribute their books and to drive sometimes i did most of the driving because of the bad roads never said even so but the lord was good in all the name of your name come here so you will get the full report on the videos for the first time i think i will prepare a video uh a presentation to show you to show the whole channel will be fun and you know you had a wonderful time here on friday so the holy spirit is the same my mom took over he was moving in karamoja so myself uh you need to pray for me to get even strength to preach i was telling one brother that some ministers in other countries they take a leave for some several days or weeks one pastor was to do that i think many many would judge me and say the pastor is becoming cannon but i think one of these days i'll do it i hope not no one will say that because you know from ethiopia ethiopia you know kenya kenya ministry here he said you don't realize that you are overworking yourself until you get above 50. again so you need to pray for me i i hope that you people love me and pray for me um before we we give our offerings i also wanted to now announce to you i'll announce it on sunday but to those of you who are here during the weekend of 22nd you'll be with us uh from around 18 to then to the new for the following week for just one week uh some of you already know him brother timothy has been here before i don't think in this fellowship but he has been in uganda before and also in ethiopia he's a son to brother john anders under john friends to us i'm sure you're also you you you you enjoyed the fellowship when they visited in ethiopia ethiopia brother timothy is a young man organizing and we trust that you will be a blessing too so uh also the wedding of uh brother uh brother o'kello named i'd like to give him an opportunity to come and give us the because i had people complaining we don't know nothing we don't know anything so brother come on i did not have it written here so uh just for you to clarify you need to know the dates of this uh the traditional ceremony and the dates of the wedding now what you begin to pay god bless your sins it's gracious to speak to you this evening i know last time pastor i clarified on this the very engagement day and previously the introduction was slated for 26. and the wedding slated for 28th of this month we've had some adjustments never win of course the introduction was to be in sorority which is still we saw the and then the wedding 4th of june but we've been having changes overall and um that's i've been waiting with pastor when he was in karamoja we've been having conversations amen updates so it is found that today is when he talked to me and he told me basically on his condition he's not having a good attachment with the dickon board yeah yeah so it was taking some time cutting uh and i've not been able to carry out some activities as usual you know that we have to make invitation cards oh yes the conclusion is the wedding is coming back to kampala and back again come away kampala so god bless you come along amen i mean so you've had
