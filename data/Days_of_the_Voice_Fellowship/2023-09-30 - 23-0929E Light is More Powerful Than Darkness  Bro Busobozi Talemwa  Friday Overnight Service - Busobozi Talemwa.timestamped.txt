[33:50] scriptures
[33:53] [Music]
[33:57] foreign
[34:01] [Music]
[34:20] [Music]
[34:26] uh my brother you've been lost for a
[34:29] long time
[34:31] I'm happy to see you today
[34:34] God bless you
[34:37] it's good to be in the house
[34:44] addiction of the ginger I just love this
[34:47] young man's commitment
[34:51] we are reading verses 7 to Summer
[34:55] [Music]
[34:58] uh uh out of Zechariah
[35:06] chapter 14.
[35:10] the Korea is
[35:12] [Music]
[35:14] just uh before Malachi
[35:22] verses chapter 14 verses 7.
[35:25] [Music]
[35:33] we just take verse 7 but it shall be one
[35:36] day which shall be known to the Lord not
[35:38] day no night but it shall come to pass
[35:41] that at evening time it shall be light
[35:44] the career isana
[35:48] [Music]
[36:01] foreign
[36:25] [Music]
[36:26] [Applause]
[36:28] brother Andrew I don't know how long
[36:30] have you been around
[36:32] just short time
[36:57] and my subject is light is more powerful
[37:00] than darkness
[37:05] is more powerful than Darkness
[37:10] amen Amina praise the Lord
[37:14] praise the Lord
[37:17] amen I mean without without Darkness
[37:23] we cannot be able to see the strength of
[37:26] light
[37:28] actually without Darkness you cannot
[37:31] know the nature of life
[37:35] you cannot know even the power of light
[37:39] but when you have darkness
[37:42] and you've been in darkness when the
[37:45] light shines you appreciate light
[37:49] when when when when light comes
[37:53] you are able to know that light is
[37:55] better than Darkness
[37:59] imagine if you walk into a dark room
[38:03] where you know you cannot even see where
[38:06] you are standing
[38:08] you know you don't know what is ahead of
[38:11] you around you
[38:13] but when the light shines
[38:17] you were able to see that there was just
[38:19] a snake right there
[38:22] and you are just going to bump into it
[38:26] you will appreciate life
[38:29] when when the light shines then you run
[38:33] away from the snakes
[38:35] so you see we cannot appreciate life
[38:40] without Darkness
[38:42] but if you had light all along
[38:47] you can even take it for granted
[38:50] I will not appreciate the power of life
[38:53] you will think it is because of your
[38:55] wisdom and strength that you will run
[38:57] away from the snakes
[39:00] but when it shines if you were in
[39:02] darkness earlier
[39:19] so now
[39:21] you know we sing a song
[39:24] that God the god of the mountains
[39:28] is the god in the valley
[39:30] when things go wrong he will make them
[39:34] right many times we want our God to be
[39:37] the god of the mountains
[39:39] [Music]
[39:40] we don't want him to be the god of the
[39:43] god in our Valley
[39:46] but the truth is life is not only you
[39:51] know uh on the mountain
[39:53] life is a series of things
[39:57] whereby sometimes you go through the
[39:59] valley
[40:00] other times you go through the mountains
[40:03] at times you go through the rivers
[40:06] other times you go through many things
[40:09] so life is a mixture of a lot of things
[40:13] but in the midst of all that
[40:16] God does not change
[40:18] many things change about life
[41:08] [Music]
[41:20] he can do again
[41:41] what happened in the beginning
[41:44] will happen again
[41:46] you know the only thing we need to do
[41:49] is to meet the same condition
[41:53] praise God just to meet the same
[41:56] condition
[41:57] that someone else
[42:00] and you will have the same results
[42:08] did not have a baby and she prayed to
[42:12] God she came at a prayer meeting like
[42:15] this one
[42:17] sometime in the future
[42:20] I'm going to speak to you
[43:19] praise God
[43:28] [Music]
[43:42] [Music]
[44:12] he speaks of the evening time here
[44:17] and we are still dealing with the
[44:19] subject of Elijah
[44:23] in the next few services on Sunday we
[44:25] are having a pastor kabasi could sign
[44:28] the truly he will be coming to minister
[44:31] for us
[44:32] but maybe on Wednesday next week I'll
[44:35] continue with the subject on Elijah
[44:39] and so I was speaking of Elijah
[44:43] and we we found that you see Elijah
[44:47] I'll show you that in the next service
[44:49] I'm speaking on that
[44:51] but when it came time for him to give
[44:54] his offering
[44:57] he gave his offering in the evening time
[45:02] there is something about the evening
[45:04] time
[45:06] the evening time is the end time
[45:10] Hallelujah sometimes God waits for you
[45:14] to go through things the whole day
[45:19] you suffer in the morning
[45:21] foreign
[46:17] [Music]
[46:48] [Music]
[47:18] he was waiting for the evening
[47:55] in the younger stage of this situation
[47:58] it would not happen in the morning
[48:03] at the end of the suffering
[48:06] sometimes Jesus waits for that time when
[48:10] you have given us that time when the
[48:12] situation is so hard
[48:14] that's when he wants to show us because
[48:17] he wants to show his greatness
[48:33] as soon as they buried Jesus
[48:39] they would have said
[48:42] that the man was not dead
[48:48] maybe was just about to die
[48:51] Jesus waited yes the first day of his
[48:55] death
[49:00] when the man is dead
[49:02] when the man is thinking
[49:05] when the man even the man God started to
[49:08] come in his mouth
[49:10] when it is almost a hundred percent sure
[49:14] it was impossible to resurrect him
[49:19] that is when Jesus
[49:22] why did he come at that moment because
[49:25] he specializes
[49:27] It seems impossible
[49:34] maybe your situation is
[49:39] if it is not sinking don't worry it is
[49:46] your situation is
[49:48] Hallelujah
[50:08] he didn't want to come he just healed
[50:11] the sick
[50:13] just to raise a person wondered
[50:20] three days
[50:23] it's a number for Perfection
[50:26] he was perfectly dead
[50:31] Jesus is waiting yes when your situation
[50:34] is perfect to be bad
[50:40] he doesn't want to come when you have
[50:44] five thousand
[50:45] when you have two thousands you say he
[50:49] will begin from here
[50:51] he wants to come when you're completely
[50:54] emptying
[50:56] when you have nothing
[51:01] he is a supernatural God
[51:04] so you can do Miracles
[51:13] [Music]
[51:15] that is
[51:20] a perfect God
[51:27] when Lazarus was already in the tombs
[51:35] they were crying says
[51:38] you know that time when you're beginning
[51:40] to
[51:55] why is it is my finances
[52:20] when you're part when your situation has
[52:22] perfectly going back
[52:25] why didn't you come Jesus
[52:41] money
[53:14] he he looks and he watches
[53:18] when you are going through a hard
[53:20] situation
[53:21] when you're going through a hard drive
[53:24] sometimes you can watch for one two
[53:26] three four five six seven eight oh um
[53:40] [Music]
[53:44] the Bible says Jesus
[53:48] in other words
[53:51] [Music]
[54:01] our Jesus always has a solution
[54:05] of the situation
[54:07] he always has a solution
[54:10] regardless of the situation
[54:14] foreign
[54:50] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[54:52] hallelujah amen
[54:54] when you are beginning to complain
[54:56] almost giving up that's when God shows
[55:01] us
[55:02] to prove to you
[55:04] I am the Lord of hosts
[55:08] I am the king of kings
[55:11] he doesn't want to share his glory with
[55:13] anymore
[55:15] he doesn't want you to say
[55:18] because I did this because
[55:24] he wants to take all the glory
[55:28] he wants you to say if it wasn't for the
[55:31] Lord
[55:32] I would not have got here
[55:38] with ginger hallelujah

[1:00:14] foreign
[1:00:20] some situations bring sadness
[1:00:24] situations like poverty
[1:00:27] oh especially here in Africa in

[1:25:53] foreign
[1:26:11] who is coming to one of the ministers in

[1:26:17] and he was just you know we're just
[1:26:20] talking about the schedules and
[1:26:21] everything
[1:26:25] and then after I finish
[1:26:30] I thought it crossed my mind
[1:26:32] oh God we need a lot of money
[1:26:37] we have barely even collected 20 to 10
[1:26:41] percent
[1:26:46] where is this money
[1:26:48] the situation is very hard
[1:26:52] to understand first we're going through
[1:26:55] my head
[1:26:56] right at that moment
[1:27:00] Ethiopia
[1:27:04] uh she sent me a scripture
[1:27:07] the scripture says this it is in
[1:27:10] Proverbs 17 3
[1:27:13] Port is for silver
[1:27:15] and the furnace for gold but the Lord
[1:27:18] tries the hearts
[1:27:21] quickly quickly quickly now
[1:27:25] this is something Supernatural that
[1:27:27] happened to me today
[1:27:32] Proverbs 17 3 English
[1:27:43] foreign
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:58] I told her I gave her some notes to this
[1:28:01] scripture
[1:28:02] and I told her the meaning of the
[1:28:04] Scripture
[1:28:06] it takes the intense heat to purify gold
[1:28:10] and silver then
[1:28:11] [Music]
[1:28:17] takes the heart the heat of trials for
[1:28:20] the Christian to be purified
[1:28:25] um
[1:28:33] and it clears out anything that gets in
[1:28:36] the way of of complete trust in him
[1:28:44] these triers will show that your faith
[1:28:46] is genuine education
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:59] though your faith is far more precious
[1:29:01] than more Gods
[1:29:06] when tough times come your way
[1:29:12] I realize that he wants to use them to
[1:29:15] refine your faith
[1:29:21] so the sister told me
[1:29:23] the spirit of God led me to send you
[1:29:27] this scripture
[1:29:29] she says God bless you Pastor
[1:29:34] and I knew what the scripture means it's
[1:29:36] another dimension which together so I
[1:29:39] said in number
[1:29:41] my sister keep me in prayer
[1:29:43] she says
[1:29:45] and I tell her it's a very timely what I
[1:29:48] tell her about this meaning and I said
[1:29:50] then because of this meaning this is a
[1:29:52] very timely message for me
[1:29:58] and she says
[1:30:04] listen these are very Supernatural words
[1:30:08] she says
[1:30:11] hey you can come and read this story
[1:30:14] just right here she says amen Pastor God
[1:30:17] is with you
[1:30:20] no matter what the devil wants to bring
[1:30:22] since
[1:30:23] he doesn't want the upcoming youth
[1:30:26] meeting
[1:30:29] he wants to withstand you
[1:30:33] resist it is easy
[1:30:38] I mean
[1:30:40] that very moment when they thought
[1:30:41] crossed my mind
[1:30:46] God gives a scripture
[1:30:54] to test my face
[1:31:01] I made a stand
[1:31:04] I made I've made long many years ago I
[1:31:06] met a stand
[1:31:08] I am not going to be begging
[1:31:13] for the ministry

[1:31:19] he is going to bless us again

[1:32:34] very difficult
[1:32:36] but that very moment
[1:32:38] God speaks God speaks to us

[1:33:26] we should resist the devil because he's
[1:33:29] a standing the devil is seeing what is
[1:33:31] coming
[1:33:32] when we came here and sat as a group of
