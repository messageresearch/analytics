[4:36] that way oh that was sorry

[5:49] guided my life
[6:35] [Music]
[7:01] okay now did you notice
[7:04] that
[7:07] not many people raised up their hands
[7:10] that's what i expected
[7:12] because i know you are struggling in
[7:13] your mind to even believe what
[7:28] our society has told us to make choices
[7:37] [Music]
[7:42] that when you make a choice that is not
[7:43] popular
[7:47] you are looked on down and you looked at
[7:50] somebody who is not serious
[7:53] as someone who is actually a fool um
[7:56] why do you think that brother banham
[7:58] would use the words like audible or was
[8:00] the right children
[8:06] who said that the people were referring
[8:08] to the christians like that
[8:21] at school i used to have what they used
[8:22] to call me
[8:48] is
[10:55] what prophet has a man of all his labor
[10:58] which he has taken under the sun
[11:07] one generation passes away and another
[11:09] generation comes but they are the fight
[11:11] forever
[11:12] a
[11:29] the wind goes towards the south and
[11:32] turns about onto the north it wallets
[11:35] about continually and the wind returns
[11:37] again according to his sockets
[11:57] [Music]
[12:06] all the rivers run into the sea yet the
[12:09] sea is not full and the place from
[12:11] whence the rivers come fifa they return
[12:13] again
[12:23] all things are full of labor man cannot
[12:25] utter it the eye is not satisfied with
[12:28] seeing not the ear filled with hearing
[12:30] every interview
[12:36] telling
[12:41] the thing that has been it is that which
[12:44] shall be and that which is done is that
[12:46] which shall be done and there is no new
[12:48] thing understand
[12:50] a chariot
[13:23] you believe because you are told by your
[13:25] trainers and teachers that you are going
[13:27] to change the world ok
[13:33] and you actually believe it
[13:36] is that now let me ask you a question
[13:40] who here has a new idea
[13:45] that has never been before
[13:58] is that whatever has been
[14:15] [Music]
[14:26] [Music]
[14:30] all these fashions just keep repeating
[14:33] themselves
[14:36] you know did you realize we were working
[14:38] in a circle it's what solomon is saying
[14:41] all the way towards the surah
[14:55] [Applause]
[14:56] and suffering
[15:32] the people we know today
[15:35] isaac newton isaac newton mentioned them
[15:50] even those who claim they have landed on
[15:52] the moon for the first time
[15:57] you will be surprised to know that there
[15:59] were others who had landed there before
[16:00] them
[16:04] that song so invented about the
[16:19] which is much greater than the one we
[16:21] had today before
[16:26] [Applause]
[16:29] before the days of the flood
[16:34] the world
[16:47] which android do we have now which
[16:50] android do we have now
[16:52] 12
[16:53] 112
[16:55] okay
[16:57] 112
[16:58] 112 you don't even know what you're
[17:00] talking about you are in the stone age
[17:18] but let me tell you
[17:19] that's a very old version
[17:22] compared to what they had there
[17:27] and the regulations before name remedy
[17:29] civilizations have been rotating
[17:44] is and the one of hallelujah hallelujah
[17:49] and the only thing you can seek out
[17:54] and you know it is sure
[17:57] it
[17:59] you is
[17:59] own them
[18:01] everything else is changed and will
[18:03] change
[18:06] and there is no new thing
[18:09] there was someone like you before you
[18:11] why do you want
[18:39] i don't mean the behavior of the flesh
[18:42] as i mean the soul and the desire of god
[18:45] in your soul
[18:49] that and god are permanent
[18:53] and everything else in the world
[18:57] yeah
[18:58] and whatever you think you're going to
[18:59] do has been done before by somebody else
[19:01] hey maybe you're not the only one joking
[19:03] that people are what where are you
[19:04] because there you go you ever thought
[19:05] about trying to do something new and
[19:06] then you when you did some survey you
[19:08] found out somebody else had already done
[19:10] it
[19:16] let me have this business
[19:21] that's why people do surveys
[19:36] you
[20:19] it was just a waste of time
[20:23] so if you invest your money in something
[20:25] before you making a good survey
[20:30] you will make a loss
[20:34] do you know why mandirachi there is a
[20:37] reason why others are not doing it
[20:46] because if you thought you were
[20:49] intelligent and more wiser than all
[20:51] those that came before you
[20:56] first find out why they did find out
[21:13] whether they were believers or not
[21:18] for instance
[21:20] the man who invented the printing press
[21:27] the one who invented the recorder
[21:56] it was used
[22:01] so don't think you're going to have an
[22:02] idea out of god
[22:07] if you don't make good number one in
[22:08] your life your idea has failed before
[22:12] [Music]
[22:45] [Applause]
[22:53] it is he that works
[23:00] hallelujah amen is the same
[23:02] yesterday
[23:04] today
[23:05] forever
[23:21] be very catholic
[23:23] so i beat the people inside siddhartha
[23:26] who thinks they can be something without
[23:28] god
[23:32] what a waste of time no you know
[23:37] listen
[23:38] oh my i'm telling you i wish i had four
[23:41] hours to preach to you that is singing
[23:42] but didn't say when you woulda but don't
[23:44] worry let them fight i'll keep my words
[23:50] these are interesting facts
[23:53] listen
[23:56] listen
[23:58] we continue with our verse
[24:01] okay where are we where that they were
[24:07] is there anybody who was following what
[24:09] would go down which verse
[24:11] we at
[24:13] verse eight
[24:16] oh no
[24:40] there is no remembrance of former things
[24:55] neither shall there be any remembrance
[24:57] of things that are to come for
[24:59] with those that shall come after such a
[25:01] word
[25:08] and here he speaks
[25:11] solomon wrote this
[25:12] you surah you coming
[25:14] for us
[25:16] not for his generation
[25:18] he is telling us
[25:21] i the preacher
[25:23] was king over israel in jerusalem
[26:22] abandonment i went to their one of their
[26:25] shrines
[26:27] i don't know how they call it
[26:29] and uh you know they checked ganja banu
[26:32] in jaga and they they say for them
[26:34] they don't meditate
[26:41] so
[26:42] so i wanted to learn about them
[26:50] for me today
[27:01] you know just you know they also have
[27:03] prophets never never not be
[28:02] and it will deceive you unless you are
[28:04] an elect
[28:06] the bible says it is so close the devil
[28:08] will be so close that he will deceive
[28:10] the very elect if it was possible
[29:38] if
[29:42] [Laughter]
[29:51] but
[30:20] sometimes you come and hug people and
[30:22] they feel like
[30:27] oh god
[30:29] believe me there was so much followers
[30:33] but as i went i walked out never suruma
[30:36] i was with the brother paul from nairobi
[30:39] i know that paul had already tested this
[30:41] thing in his youth
[30:45] and so he knew this thing very well
[30:48] but he was also
[31:00] that my camera my big camera which i
[31:02] just bought
[31:41] oh
[31:59] do not trust the world the way she can
[32:01] see
[32:04] hallelujah me now when sin is around you
[32:06] hey
[32:08] you feel like this is a real deal
[32:11] for sure
[32:12] even
[32:41] what again you do other snakes
[32:46] you know snake is very wise
[32:49] when it wants to eat birds
[33:22] foreign
[33:37] neighborhood
[33:38] and it's just changing its colors
[33:43] black white red
[33:47] so as the birds are in there in the
[33:49] trees
[34:16] because the way i'm seeing
[34:32] just be here
[35:00] is
[35:09] [Music]
[36:11] so you go there and you think that
[36:12] because so and so did it
[36:15] again
[36:16] i never go in there
[36:17] i've heard many people say
[36:19] that you know
[36:23] and you look at him it seems as if
[36:25] everything is okay
[36:29] even if i also
[36:30] don't know what he's going through
[36:34] stick with what you're supposed to do
[36:36] naturally
[36:37] for all this wanted
[36:53] okay
[36:54] i the preacher was a king over israel in
[36:56] jerusalem
[37:04] i hope someone will do that today can
[37:06] you sing about
[37:15] i gave my heart to seek and search out
[37:18] by wisdom concerning all things that are
[37:21] done under the heaven this soul travail
[37:24] has god given to the sons of man to be
[37:27] exercise their way
[37:28] names
[37:46] and i have seen
[37:47] never all
[38:00] [Music]
[38:02] spirit
[38:16] attaining
[38:58] education is of the devil
[39:03] so you mean we should should be
[39:04] illiterate
[39:07] oh go to school
[39:10] do what you have to find a job
[39:12] whatever
[39:43] i have seen okay right that that which

[39:48] and that which is one thing cannot be
[39:50] numbered
[39:52] verse 15.
[40:06] and i've gotten more wisdom than all
[40:08] they that have been before me in
[40:10] jerusalem yeah my heart had a great
[40:13] experience of wisdom and knowledge
[40:21] against manchester
[40:37] [Music]
[40:39] against manchester united and knowledge
[40:41] and i gave my heart to no wisdom
[40:44] and to know madness and fully
[40:47] perceived that this
