[18:25] and the heart of his servants that i
[18:28] might show thee
[18:30] my signs before him
[18:49] [Music]
[18:51] the heart of pharaoh it is because he
[18:53] wants to show his signs
[18:59] if there is something that you are
[19:01] praying for and i've been believing for
[19:02] and it is taking too long to manifest
[19:04] because god wants to show his signs
[19:20] and god sometimes happens the people and
[19:23] the things around us so that he can
[19:25] manifest his signs
[19:32] no signs are not for us
[20:04] amina
[20:06] yes sir amen and that thou may still in
[20:09] the ears of thy son and of thy son son
[20:13] what things i have wrote in egypt and my
[20:16] signs which i have done among them that
[20:19] he may know how that i am the lord
[20:29] [Music]
[20:39] [Music]
[20:55] and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh
[20:57] and said unto him that saith the lord
[20:59] god of the hebrews how long will thou
[21:02] refuse to humble thyself before me let
[21:05] my
[21:06] people
[21:07] go
[21:08] the day may serve me
[21:14] watch
[21:29] amen hey man you may have your seats
[21:34] uh sister dorothy i'm happy to see you
[21:36] as the daughter was saying
[21:38] and i was you know
[21:40] sharing with a little
[21:44] and i think in the coming weeks i will
[21:46] take a a subject on
[21:49] uh well i'll just keep it for now but
[21:51] there's something i want to speak on in
[21:52] the coming weeks
[22:10] then you cannot
[22:32] and we see that god
[22:34] spoke to uh uh uh moses and aaron
[22:38] down here
[22:41] and
[22:42] spoke to them
[22:44] and and say that a mother said aaron
[22:46] came in under farah and said unto him
[22:48] thus saith the lord god of the hebrews
[22:50] how long will that refuse to humble
[22:52] thyself before me
[23:03] i saw these these hebrews
[23:49] but never beings
[23:50] the hebrews were different
[23:53] and until today i want to tell you
[23:56] there is a promise that god gave them
[23:58] one word
[24:00] and they say that they will possess the
[24:02] gates
[24:15] amen i tell you i've been in ethiopia
[24:18] and i met them with you and i was
[24:20] meeting one man you know i'm saying that
[24:21] when i see you began to tell me that he
[24:23] was in one of the conferences
[24:27] well there was also the ambassador just
[24:29] recently whether i was also the
[24:30] ambassador of the of israel
[24:34] and they were speaking about the
[24:35] ethiopian jews
[24:39] doctors and many you know people
[24:41] dignitaries
[24:55] that live in the northern parts of the
[24:57] country arabic
[25:13] you know because they would just look at
[25:15] you
[25:17] and you can be cast no furniture
[25:20] and they they said they have bad eyes
[25:24] and so they don't like them
[25:46] that conference was trying to see how
[25:48] they can get them back maybe to their
[25:49] homeland or to try and see how they can
[25:51] be able to live and cohabit these people
[26:19] you see let me tell you this is the
[26:21] promise of god election

[27:57] and he elected them
[27:59] and he chose them
[28:00] to
[28:10] whoever blesses israel god bless us
[28:42] you the bible tells us to pray he
[28:45] doesn't say pray for the peace of uganda
[28:47] bible together
[28:49] you can pray for the peace of america
[28:51] america pray for the peace of your
[28:53] christ
[28:55] the bible says
[28:56] pray
[29:34] and god
[29:35] did not want them to stay in egypt

[32:27] that was not the purpose why we were
[32:29] born in your sins

[1:45:44] any glory
[1:45:48] god starts builds something from nothing
[1:45:51] catholics image into ocula
