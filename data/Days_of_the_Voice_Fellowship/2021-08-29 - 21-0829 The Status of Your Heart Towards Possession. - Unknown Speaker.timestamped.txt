[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:09:01] i want to greet you all in the name of
[1:09:03] jesus christ
[1:09:26] amen
[1:09:28] so this morning by the grace of god
[1:09:32] i want to speak on the status of your
[1:09:33] heart
[1:09:45] towards possession
[1:10:13] this morning my name
[1:10:28] your family over there we're gonna get
[1:10:30] peter and family children
[1:10:32] god bless you come on sir
[1:10:35] uh we're reading from hebrews chapter
[1:10:37] four together
[1:10:42] okana
[1:10:55] [Music]
[1:11:08] we're reading from
[1:11:25] for the
[1:11:26] for for the word of god is quick and
[1:11:28] powerful and sharper than energy to edge
[1:11:31] this word piercing even to the dividing
[1:11:33] asander of the soul and spirit and the
[1:11:36] joints and and marrow and is a designer
[1:11:39] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:52] of
[1:12:06] okay
[1:12:48] where you are
[1:13:02] and i know this is true
[1:13:04] that each of us many times have very
[1:13:06] many needs
[1:13:13] the body of christ is a needy body oh
[1:13:16] moving christians
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:26] we need not only the spiritual blessings
[1:13:28] of the world
[1:13:32] but also the physical blessings that
[1:13:34] sustain us in this physical life
[1:13:41] for instance if you did not have
[1:13:43] anything
[1:13:44] you know in your pocket probably you
[1:13:46] wouldn't have clothes
[1:13:53] if you do not have wisdom probably you
[1:13:56] may not be able to accomplish your
[1:13:58] school dream
[1:14:04] if you do not have money maybe you may
[1:14:06] not be able to build a house if you want
[1:14:09] to build the house for your family
[1:14:11] in a sense
[1:14:14] so if you do not have enough resources
[1:14:16] you may not be able to get the needs
[1:14:18] such as you want in this life
[1:14:25] and so very many people have resorted to
[1:14:28] after praying and they thought that god
[1:14:30] never answered their prayers they have
[1:14:32] resorted to finding other ways of
[1:14:34] getting their needs other than god
[1:14:39] indeed
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:15:07] well of course stealing does not
[1:15:09] necessarily mean that you go grab
[1:15:10] something and steer it away
[1:15:16] but really even according to the
[1:15:18] scripture in the word of god in malachi
[1:15:20] chapter three my name is
[1:15:36] here this morning i mean when this
[1:15:40] is
[1:15:41] in the book of malachi chapter 3 verse
[1:15:44] verses 1.
[1:16:19] not according to me katichi noticing is
[1:16:22] it he is saying that a man
[1:16:24] will indeed drop god again
[1:16:29] that you can surely be a robot
[1:16:59] so there are many people according to
[1:17:00] god according to me catholic and you
[1:17:03] sincerely understand that
[1:17:07] and well why do they hope
[1:17:10] to begin with yes
[1:17:12] they wrote because they thought
[1:17:24] because he has plenty um
[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:42] and so he thinks he's just trying to do
[1:17:45] justice
[1:17:47] in kenya how can you have a two houses
[1:17:50] and he has one oh they wrote
[1:17:53] them
[1:17:55] up to phone that he has one already
[1:18:00] so he thinks he's just trying to do
[1:18:01] justice you know to the phone so he will
[1:18:03] just have to take his phone and utilize
[1:18:05] it
[1:18:11] so a thief is not entirely a thief
[1:18:13] because it's bad katya would be
[1:18:15] simultaneous he's a thief because he's
[1:18:18] trying to satisfy his needs
[1:18:23] or the needs of his father
[1:18:38] presume that because she has more
[1:18:39] children than you to take care of
[1:18:43] it
[1:18:46] and so according to culture they would
[1:18:48] say well
[1:18:49] with exception of how well she's going
[1:18:50] to save production she's stealing kathy
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:58] [Applause]
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:03] so now the bible says that even
[1:19:05] christians can rob god
[1:19:12] [Applause]
[1:19:25] [Applause]
[1:19:31] and because what someone else has in
[1:19:33] this case god has kept it with you
[1:19:41] so you kind of think well i can use this
[1:19:45] god will come later
[1:19:47] but this morning i'm speaking on the
[1:19:49] status of your heart
[1:19:59] what's possession of god is promises for
[1:20:02] you
[1:20:16] because you think you need more mango
[1:20:19] the other day someone was asking me a
[1:20:20] question
[1:20:22] in our bible study
[1:20:25] he said faster
[1:20:26] what if you you you your needs are more
[1:20:29] than your income what younger
[1:21:12] and then plan
[1:21:48] where are you
[1:22:02] in offerings everywhere where are you
[1:22:04] now the reason why i'm speaking on this
[1:22:07] because i feel that the church of christ
[1:22:09] is in much later
[1:22:10] in jesus name
[1:22:13] god sets down his principles in his word
[1:22:16] catholics
[1:22:19] in order for us to possess all the
[1:22:22] blessings he has prepared for us
[1:22:27] if we get out of those precipitation
[1:22:32] then we are bound to fail
[1:22:36] that's why he says you
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:23:20] is that this is the promise of god
[1:23:22] i personally believe it isn't going unto
[1:23:24] jesus i read it in my life since 16
[1:23:26] years ago
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:31] hallelujah amen and you want to ask me
[1:23:34] did god keep his background oh yeah
[1:23:37] yeah
[1:23:39] yes indeed
[1:23:40] and he says i will rebuke the devourer
[1:23:42] for your sex and you shall not destroy
[1:23:44] the fruits of your ground
[1:24:01] shall be a delightsome land say the lord
[1:24:03] of hosts
[1:24:10] and when some people
[1:24:11] someone asked another question the other
[1:24:13] day can i say when i i'm i'm
[1:24:16] speaking what how i've spent my money
[1:24:18] can i say i've also spent on times i've
[1:24:20] spent on these and then you mentioned
[1:24:23] that
[1:24:43] so how can you now account for what is
[1:24:45] not yours
[1:24:47] how can you spend what is not yours
[1:24:52] you cannot count among your expenditures
[1:25:11] desire for the offerings
[1:25:17] from that then you give god
[1:25:19] everywhere
[1:25:22] and what you decide to give is what you
[1:25:24] give
[1:25:25] yourself why are you two why but god has
[1:25:27] determined that ten percent is his name
[1:25:33] hallelujah
[1:25:34] so that is the word of god
[1:25:37] and what is the status of your heart
[1:25:39] towards that word
[1:25:45] the word of god is quick
[1:25:50] and energy
[1:25:51] george singer
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:53] hallelujah amen but right now
[1:27:56] it's our time
[1:28:40] yes sadly that is true
[1:28:46] did you realize that people have a
[1:28:47] behavior
[1:28:50] that they always want to be involved in
[1:28:52] things that they may benefit from
[1:29:00] you know they kind of feel that i cannot
[1:29:02] be involved in a society or organization
[1:29:05] or something when i don't benefit
[1:29:07] anything
[1:29:08] since
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:35] and many times they realize they're not
[1:29:36] going to
[1:29:47] and many of them have decided to walk as
[1:29:51] christians but as double dealers
[1:30:01] they are christians in the church but
[1:30:04] mechanism
[1:30:17] otherwise they will be in the world
[1:30:57] because many of them are believers
[1:30:59] because of what of
[1:31:28] is
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:32:11] amen even biologically
[1:32:14] you know the blood of the mama or the
[1:32:16] mother does not come into the
[1:32:19] bloodstream of this of the daughters
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:58] [Applause]
[1:34:44] if those are your
[1:34:58] [Applause]

[1:36:48] many times
[1:37:03] foreign
[1:37:12] something which they are ready to
[1:37:14] possess
[1:37:16] something which you are ready to possess
[1:37:18] aching to
[1:37:29] and the ability to believe that word
[1:37:31] without doubting or
[1:37:45] hallelujah

[2:36:57] was the one that was following elijah
[2:36:59] all the time

[2:37:32] second kings chapter
[2:37:34] 2 verse 1.
[2:37:39] give me the passport
[2:37:42] and it came to pass when the lord would
[2:37:44] take up elijah into heaven
[2:37:46] by a whirlwind

[2:37:51] with elijah from gilgal
[2:37:53] and elijah said unto elisha
[2:37:56] tarry here i pray
[2:38:00] for the lord has sent me to bethel and
[2:38:02] elisha said unto him as the lord liveth
[2:38:05] and as thy soul leave it i will not
[2:38:07] leave thee
[2:38:08] so they went down together
[2:38:47] and the sons of the prophets that were
[2:38:48] at bethel came
[2:38:49] forth to elijah and said unto him i was
[2:38:52] thou that the lord will take away thy

[2:41:14] but now as we are transitioning from the
[2:41:16] ministry of elisha
[2:41:22] i want you to understand that the
[2:41:23] ministry of elijah continued in the
[2:41:26] ministry of elections
[2:41:34] but you need to see the status of the
[2:41:36] heart of elisha
[2:41:42] elisha loved what was in elijah
[2:41:48] whereas
[2:41:49] rejected it
[2:41:53] there was an elisha while they were
[2:41:56] not willing to trade anything for the
[2:41:58] ministry that you have seen in their
[2:41:59] life

[3:11:04] he speaks back
[3:11:07] i think versus 26.
[3:11:10] you see that
[3:11:11] no that's three yet on the three
[3:11:13] okay

[3:11:24] them upon two of his servants and they
[3:11:26] bear them before him

[3:11:47] he has lost all the desire for this
[3:11:50] message
[3:11:59] [Music]
[3:12:01] and when this man left a message
[3:12:37] always be careful when you are pastors
[3:12:39] or when the man of god asks you what is
[3:12:41] wrong with you again
[3:12:57] because god sees all
[3:12:58] things god knows your life
[3:13:10] in his house
[3:13:11] requests
[3:13:12] he told
[3:13:41] of your heart embedded
[3:13:42] can cause you to be
[3:13:44] to receive a blessing or to receive a
[3:13:46] sovereign term
[3:13:49] it can cause you to prosper somebody
[3:13:51] could have colonia
[3:13:52] or
