he doesn't need to need he will just sit aside and let you fight each other but my prayer in this new year we have entered some conflict I thank God for that but I pray that we may be God maybe you unite us more at Westfield that he may give us that he will give us that that fast of pain but everybody will get an example they would want to be like in the scriptures from The Young and to the

it's already okay thank you uh it is the fact that the prophet for the last eight must be bringing forth a message from God that will forerun the second coming of the Lord but by his message and with the restoration of the words saying that the land through which we have gone to such it is a land that the land was eating its inhabitants praise be to God seek but these men were seeing the milk and the Honey flowing in the fruits maybe that was the time when Caleb told Joshua that mountain there I've loved it yeah so when they went back what are you and they possessed the land and Caleb came back to Joshua and told him man give my mouth don't accept other people to see on your behalf the good thing they will take the bigger things fight and we inherit together blessed be the name of the

grateful to be here with you this is thank you all for For Your Love most important today for praying for me as a young Minister because I don't know where your lord is actually what Pastor has talked about is also what I want to talk about it is it is my first testimony I won't Testify the Lord and thanking him God changed me I don't understand [Music] I thank God for my life um and and I won't share about that what what I think it is good for me to talk about that and I think let us read in John chapter one let's start with 19. and this is the record of Jones when the Jews sent priests and Levits from Jerusalem to ask him and he confessed and denied the note but to confess I am not that Christ is Auntie foreign [Music] whether he was the prophet [Music] but we know the story of Jones was that sound in the wilderness that sound there is another word they wanted to use you know we shall get there okay we know that the story of John yeah John had a promise to come before the Lord so when he came he was telling people prepare the way for the Lord then he answered the saying I baptized with water but there stands among you whom he know note he it is Who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes Legends I am not worth it to earn rules I think brother ranga continue reading up to about when I tell you to stop is [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus and he walked and he said Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples had him speak and they followed Jesus then Jesus stand and saw them following and says unto them what seek ye they said unto him which is to say being interrupt interpreted Master where dwells thou and say it unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the tennis hour Amina now I want to tell you about what what changed me and what changed me I believe is staying under the message and listening to the message listening to the preaching of the message no one preached to me this message and I escorted him to church I went to church then I listened to the message I got attracted to it I spent one one month without going I went back the next month it sounded so sweet I sat down and listened I think the next month I sat under the preaching of them like these boys these brothers who is when they saw Jesus they followed him and they went with him he spent with him the whole night when they spent with him the whole night spend your time brothers who are still out there if you're convinced foreign sometimes I sit and I say I wish I was born in the message I just noticed that she was a Believer by the way she was dressing and I told her sister you're lucky for you were born in the message [Music] and she said brother I tell you what you have experienced the world and now we are serious with the message you know hey I think those who have been home have seen her brother hahaha why are you laughing what did me tell you my age I won't say it I've worked in family she's about about she's about 70. I've worked with families with youths like when are you planning to get married not yet you're a believersary he used to like you have never seen a girl in your room when the the only person I saw in your room was that boy you pray with that was Brothers she was touched and he said Hallelujah then he said 39 then he said unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him no there's another scripture I want to read here praise the Lord come help us away one of the two who had John and followed him was Andrew Simon Simon Peter's brother he he first defined his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted Christ now when this brother went and stayed with Jesus praise the Lord so I'll get time and expand on this year but I would want to thank God so much for the opportunity he has given me give me an opportunity to preach this is just the beginning I pray that God gave me strength and the opportunity to preach more you know I have a testimony I'm not in a Harriet forget how God got me a job this year series so I was so desperate having graduated in 2019 but did not have a formal employment she gave me a job without without paying anything yeah I I remember how desperate I was I was supposed I was going to join army and I told Pastor I want to join amen I thank God for protection in December this this the previous month I've seen a lot of accidents [Music] I want to thank you I want thank God for this Fellowship there is love among us to us this year when Solomon got a problem I came from work and I came here ran to me and she told me have you heard from Brothers solomona ceremony and I told her please call I want to find out um I thank God he gave me a motorcycle I was struggling with transportation praise the Lord I wish you a new year my message to you the New Year message is get concerned if you're convinced that this is the the true message then preach it is Hallelujah man that woman also got convinced and concerned and redeemed her family um so I challenge you this year let's share the message comics foreign [Music] so you see you cannot say oh if this this message has changing power um why doesn't everybody get changed why do some come in the church and go back those who were meant to be changed all right now Sister Dorcas and sister Maureen foreign brother our Deacon London um how many would love to hear he's New Year wishes so God bless you you will come after I don't know [Music] song number 709 a bless us Central's never busy always on the line you may hear from heaven almost any time Jesus free for one and all when you get in trouble give this Royal Line equal telephone to Glory our joy Divine I can't feel the current moving on the line viewed by God the Father foreign [Music] it was beautiful service just for you and me oh teleport to Glory always [Music] foreign [Music] and you get an answer to destroy yourself [Music] true [Music] your soul is [Music] the boys [Music] good by the boys [Music] foreign [Music] 10 minutes I want to thank pasta so much asked me the people would want to hear from you yeah foreign foreign [Music] because my work holds me so much thank God I remember I used to have challenges Friday then I pray to God and I changed that beauty so it is now my hope then I also had a challenge and I prayed to God and that beauty Saturday night was changed so I'm off Saturday night it helps me to be not to be very busy continuous then now I have a challenge with Wednesday because it's difficult for me to come on Wednesday forgive me so much I would like to address uh some few otherwise you know there are things which you you wouldn't want to directly talk to them what do I mean because you expect them to know for example if they we are reading the word categories wouldn't expect you to stay seated you may feel like I'm embarrassing so let's be guided I think now uh about four things first the mothers with the children you know the children they are not concerned about our things which we are doing so once in a while you know they are happy yes we request the mothers to always guide the children you know as I've told you if I come to the mother and tell you what you already you know what to do things it would seem like I'm embarrassing washrooms I thank the brothers we are having challenge sometimes there is the water is not enough sometimes maybe the tissues we want to organize ourselves this year when you come to church you should feel comfortable in every aspect so I think that's what we should do so that as you come to church you should consecrate all the time which the little you have for the service now when you come from the washroom we have always ensured there is water don't enter the church without washing your house [Music] then now we have um outbreak of coffee coffee I think this disease is not a respecter whether you're from praying tax my advice the the best you can is to wash your hands I'm against again single power mungaru because as much as you may shake hands um then there is this concerned when a minister is on the pulpit to pray um do not move around you know sometimes you know they are praying and then some people want to move around some people respect to the national anthem I think we should also respect what we consider important yes things like when we are reading the word somebody is praying even if you are outside and you're late foreign [Music] you are you know that brother called me one day you know I was on duty that it was night brother I want to see you for the problems then we talked to some things he knows them better money brother is it okay you know it's so good if you accept to be guided in about 12 years since I believed the word um you know there may be things which are passed through although I mean to be an item maybe I can give you a small advice you know that brother is a very sweet spirit I think what he does I may not be able to do it Pastor I am I'm having this what do you advise me you know such a thing he had a challenge I think he was arranging something like a marriage yeah you know obviously but I think the sister was not a believer you know those types so he was asking me if there is a way to turn it around so that he can take everything and I want to thank God I believe the brother took my heart there are many times we fall into mistakes because we are not humble enough may God bless you brother so much [Music] uh I don't want to play so much I think I maybe I have five or ten minutes I thank God for the previous year he blessed me with a small motorcycle yeah you're not grateful for the small things God has given you um some people when they pray to God maybe they expect one Millions I think this this is not something you know this is even in some brethren I'm sorry it's safe foreign [Music] The Grateful outreaching of your mind in thankful praise to the Supreme Buddhism um is a liberation of force awaited cannot fail to reach that to which it is addressed again and the reaction is an instantaneous movement towards you foreign you say it does not come on time okay it is a small small you know then you shut down that much [Music] however when you thank God somebody may be touched [Music] it if you don't appreciate the lead to God has given you is not going to give you big things this is the advice to our women if I give you something small when you thank me you know I may even have more yeah but I choose to for the moment to give you something [Music] so if you keep quiet about it I don't think you may get personally that's one thing I want to uh please report to the prophet is one message we are grateful to thee tonight to have a privilege of living foreign we must be grateful manga if you are not grateful to a fellow man it's difficult to do it for God I want to talk to you about three people always you can just cry okay if you are a housewife and instead of talking a lot to just crash [Music] to me that's better so testimonies by the way there are some people some people who don't know how to express their gratitude [Music] you know it should be something which comes from the heart God is not interested in a lot of words you may not you may not tell what I thank you foreign [Music] testimonies way or showing you that you thank God then lastly giving not only in church love a fellow man no and you think you're going to give to the God only in church we have every girl today [Music] God has healed me miraculous testimony but there's no time one time I had a painfulness seven years ago they were praying it was a Congolese preacher about Randy then as you're just there my brother then something tells you to move away and there was no pain it's not because I was praying soon God can God is sovereign when you're in the Sun you know you develop that itching because of the radiations and sometimes Divine Healing takes time is like nothing is happening now I don't remember when the healing happens I just looked back some about two years ago and this thing was not coming hello then uh I want to thank God we almost died in a bad accidents [Music] I think were supposed to have fractures and you know this happened I used to just escape from work and come for night prayers to but this the last one was the bad one the motorcycle was not crashed potatoes [Music] [Music] the man who tried to run away and leave the abandoned on the car tomorrow and blood group b plus and my wife is blood group or negative uh negative positive cutting negative what you got any positive no it brings a mismatch I don't know if you'll understand you know it's something like if I'm blood group and I give my blood to somebody blood groups so this situation happened the first the first child will usually survive much but the second we usually nice and that's the families which you usually have miscarriage because the beginning of which the mother gets recognized by the body of the mother as a foreign kill this if science is true this this is what was supposed to happen for my from my daughter because but you know I trust the medicine and all that is I go to Revelation to believe and once the Revelation comes you feel relaxed truthfully speaking I didn't have because it's about eight hundred thousand Amazon because there is some vaccine we usually use to calm down that reactions but I want to tell you that God can even do what our science says to me that is [Applause] to those who don't know londe is also a medical doctor so if you didn't understand those explanations many times he has had to be a personal doctor to many families you know they call him even to us here not fair I know I don't remember the last time we went to the hospital he does the prescription you go by the medicine and the child becomes um he's been a blessing to the body and we we want to say God bless you so much may you be more of a blessing in this year in whatever the Lord leads you to do for them because behind him is a wife Mr Price we appreciate you also praise God bless you so much we appreciate both of you and love you do we love them amen praise the Lord now I want to invite uh one more uh brother he's an interpreter and a minister evangelist out there speaks to us he has been a blessing before he comes I would invite another young man [Music] but before the young man comes Shalom beloved Saints of the Monster High God I thank him for enabling all of us to cross over and she says she has a special song the young men are not singing what is happening yeah just come and sing for us of course if you're saying for us you're singing for the Lord amen I mean okay as she comes to be like Jesus everybody now to be like Jesus [Music] you want to be like him this year oh it's all through lives John oh yes [Music] to be like [Music] don't sing song 228 the greeting is better once my heart why was my heart and life with it bye by The Binding chains of sea but the great demons [Music] Set Me Free To Worship peace [Music] yes they'd be His holy name he is the greatest [Music] [Music] but the seeking Shepherd for me to my father's soul s [Music] [Music] there is [Music] does the Sun [Music] rise [Music] camera Isaac because [Music] it's it's a deep honor that the Lord has given me a chance to stand before you um you are the most precious in all this world I mean God doesn't care about the Stars the sun you are his most precious so I'm going to be brief I mean everyone has said they're going to be briefing is to use that word I'm going to start with a song it's called such love and I'm just going to report not to sing it says that Christ should join so freely in the scheme although it meant his death whatever human tank Vines [Music] than love divine that runs on us it's my favorite part that far will fall outcasts such as the Savior Bleed and died enough Redemption for a worthless slave to buy who long had law and Grace [Music] so um I've I've titled my short term meet yeah I've tried to teach undeservedly deserving so I'm just going to run through a Short scripture here it has been my driving force I think since secondary Church even when I did not understand it fully the Lord was gracious enough to help me understand and he that formed thee or Israel not for I have redeemed I have called thee by thy name when thou passes through the waters and through the rivers when thou walk is through the fire neither shall the Flamez and since thou worst precious in myself foreign um as a Christian style it scares me so much that uh at some point there is that line between us making it to heaven and the other people going the other side but this has been proved and it has been certain in verse 11 if you get time and read there I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no service this is the Old Testament you should know so he used the word severeign even when it meant him being an outcaster yeah so um a lot of times at all times we are all undiserable we we did not work this thing out we did not breaking news we we are only blessed before the foundation of the Earth the Bible says that nothing can separate us because we are part of [Music] the pastor previously said in the last preaching we have no place in hell since we are part of you foreign [Music] um yeah I mean my life was not so strange um but because God knew me he called me out by name he humbled me through what they call a masterpiece plan because if you've listened to that someone is foreign so I mean uh it is very fascinating that God keeps choosing us even when we record and we are very blessed that Mercy keeps rewriting us that every time we choose to go south God says it is not for you he said where you want to go again I paid that as a run so uh that is how beautiful I I take my Jesus and uh a bit about my life I'm very grateful uh I think I always dreamed about very crazy things at some point I was a dancer [Music] um yeah yeah I mean I've I think I wrote some songs back then but I I think I used to think I'd be a hip-hop but I mean on a pool place [Laughter] and it is surprising I can testify I mean it's been years I had thoughts to go to a club and when you're out of it now you can understand the scripture necklaces and you're spending money so you know it is very absurd but this is where the Lord had to draw me and uh I gave him a promise and just like the man Gideon gideoni I am I am I I I gave him tests I think so and it is very good and painful that he has fulfilled everyone as a human you always want him to fail so that you have Justified when I reach in heaven you're like I'll draw a master plan I'll tell him you're not good I asked you for this you refused I mean he shaped the Stars more intelligent than all of us he has outsmarted me at every point and I'm very grateful to him and to the people here I want to tell you I love every single one of you at a general level individual he gave me the clothes in which I was baptized and I am forever indebted to him time the Lord has used him in very very different ways to change my life [Music] and a little bit of Jewel somewhere when I had just entered the message I used to question a lot uh it seemed I don't want to say it was it seemed like I was questioning the word of God I just know our God is faithful and he approaches every one of us because we are all shaped in a very unique way the way he approached me is different from the way he talked to brothers and to the people who have kept on giving me chances I mean I've wasted a lot of them I've disappointed uh disappointed a lot of people in different ways I'm sorry I am not sorry the camera is here that is the basic of what I had to share and just in a way of wrapping up what I have to say God's love is freely given without conditions and he has clearly told us that even when we sinned he will not find any sin on you because he's so beautiful the day I got this Revelation you see he's good katonda he's sitting up here and then he's the high priest and then he's our advocacy just keep in your position [Music] and abide in your callings it is going to be a long process [Music] that the Lord is faithful a cup an encounter with God yes did not ask for his brother's life he did not ask God for land he asked God for a blessing yes sometimes with prayer Miss but Jacob has encouraged me in very many ways not even in the worst of situations he stood a chance to say God help my brother forgive me and then I'll go back and it's done he had the chance to say what brother Henry said but he did not ask for that he asked for God's blessings foreign to the mother of the house all the many chances you've given me um yeah I think my words are done you are all expecting me to say one last person um thank you so much the Lord has used you in very many different ways don't lose hope may the Lord bless you God bless you come on good morning come on that is something that [Music] some of you when you saw this young man speak you may not understand the people at home here I believe I am a solid believer that God can change anyone and because I've seen him do it and in the message getting in the spirit brother says listen very careful what we need is not psychology moves [Music] but we need a Holy Spirit here the people cry out he says where is that God that once and washes who takes a prostitute from the street makes a lady out of it who takes a drunkard now you've had a young man tell you he was going to the bus you know this you know being DJ what What DJ it takes a drunk out of the bathroom and makes a preacher out of here [Music] is this a prophet saying where is that God that can move out legs and make those blind eyes to hear um amen [Music] I asked him to give a testimony he want to preach it what made him do that foreign [Music] together [Music] praise the name of the Lord I think before I hand it over to brother uh to brother brother because after brother we'll take a little break and have a roasted this young man who has been preaching to us as is roasting uh foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] if I had time to give a testament about all these people I'm inviting here would not end up but brother Isaac come and give your testimony I don't know what it is about but I know it's about the power of God Amen and then brother Rwanda will close with this first session oh that's why I'm dressed [Music] up um I really don't know where I can start from the kid my starting point is the same as my endpoint can is so [Music] safe I'm here to give a testimony and say that I'm so grateful one God has done for me foreign [Music] [Music] so me standing here right now I can say that of all of you who are here because I believe no one has such a thing to engage so I don't know where to start but it was to be briefly uh in mathematics we have what we call a distance time graph distance time graph so this graph graph where you you have distance on this side for it to be steady it has to be moving straight like this is straight so when it's straight like this one is a distance or time is at zero and one is moving straight so one is accelerating like the distance is continuing but that time is not moving so foreign steadily it has to be moving in like the time moving at this just moving [Music] all right so I want to say that um it was around um almost at the beginning of this year and uh and uh I came back uh to Uganda Uganda and you know I've seen many people mean inclusive who have been there you know thinking that here in this country there are the now I'm speaking um in physical terms so it can be a testimony it can build you mind but spiritual and more your name so um I returned from uh where I'd gone to work and um I had nothing when I talk about nothing I mean so now I want to show you what God can do so um came to the church after a long time and um thank you the Brethren who were there we pray and all of the things we pray was God's blessings because I had nothing if everyone's prayer was something so um I really give my heart out tomorrow and God had my prayers I didn't even know that maybe life would change this is the transition zero to one and then Counting please so now um it was I think weeks there was a wider we keep weak I started praying for a joke [Music] uh I could say I could come to the past I said it's a very difficult yeah you could tell me the number there's only one like it's like hello with Christ if you are looking for a joke you can't get it yes we know God may be maybe testing there's something wrong in your life so I took that one so it was like two weeks after time so some of you if any of you is applying for jobs [Music] and you see her can I apply foreign we are called for interviews I said this is it um it was for 30 minutes after like seven minutes I saw people giving games actually they gave us even more time so I spent even more time I've done this interview foreign the following day it was a weekend actually I received a call and they were like you know what so president I want you to get this world I guess I was the only person foreign [Music] this is a true story so because I was you know I didn't expect it is [Music] now about this I don't know uh you know it was a joke health insurance so they say okay come tomorrow so they were giving me that money and I'm the one who asked for it when I asked for the money they didn't say that I know we shall give you this is the money that I asked they gave to me exactly so thank God it was a cartoon so that was it that is dumb the movement those who are in touch I gave it this morning so I worked in Kola so there was this recession that was going on in the U.S America it's even foreign [Music] microsofty so the company I'm working for is an American company because it was time so we're about 13 people time for us [Music] I remembered the word my life is right you came for our company Etc we are late foreign have not yet come to the main test that was the time I felt like the money I asked centers I have to turn it around destroyed all those leaves [Music] yes I had to claim it um yet the first sorry I'm the one who does but right now I wanted something more not being greedy but as a Christian must be hates way foreign turned around I wanted to increase your salary by the way but may I the truth is he never said it um in the beginning he never said that he wanted to increase but when I told him by the way I wanted to increase it so yes we are going to go into it Uganda all right so I'm not going to say how much seconds but what I can say is that some company managers so this really makes me think ing uh this is uh I think the second month we are starting the new year with new resolutions [Music] this company in Uganda you know company Uganda they are also so interested they are interested in like since I got involved in the work now we do recruitment recruitment companies and these are the big companies like Microsoft Microsoft if you know Johnson and Johnson vaccines so these companies and companies are all the people that I found working there they have been working only that role but when I got there God favors me names that it gives me a Authority Empire National functions many times different places which is also an opportunity that no one has so I'm here to tell you God is more faithful than new things this is why I come to say that this year the point where I can say it has been my best uh rather everyone has talked about actually I use a border border every day to and frothy we hear people uh getting uh killed by accidents they said you know what everyone should buy a helmet but I've taken trips more than 100 to and fro dumb I've not even ever been involved in one yes [Music] I'm not bragging but the truth is what is faithful and I believe he has more plans so [Music] I can't say everything so thankful foreign [Music] has pushed us to lead me to to uh limits how to seen this natural language like me myself I got a point where I default like there's no numbers so may God bless you sir thank you for praying for me and we pray that you give me your prayers day foreign foreign [Music] no he has committed this year um you have some financial trouble you have had a testimony I think it was worth hearing can encourage us that God is also able to provide Financial [Music] understanding to collect our to when we started the church those who don't have jobs and uh I believe if you've not committed anything and uh you know Isaac's testimony is just amazing you know like he said he went abroad yeah out of God is will because I came back with nothing but because he came back and started out into God's way God blessed him with a blessing he was not even able to get abroad so people think people think let them go out and look for money if you're a Believer and you are here never try that you better be in the goddess the blessing is always I think we thank God because he's a testimony and he has given his testimony praise the name of the Lord I am so happy that there is no one does this God bless you all right amen Amina amen understand understand we will give a 20 20 25 minutes to brother Wanga to finish this first
