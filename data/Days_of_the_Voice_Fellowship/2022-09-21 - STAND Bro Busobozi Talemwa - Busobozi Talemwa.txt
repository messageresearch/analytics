many as we think that are still standing many have already fallen and even when they profess the faith you know there is one one thing that is so bad for some people to think that you are standing well you have fallen well you haven't Revenge and God expects us to stand we are not children we are soldiers and we are soldiers in the army of the Lord God expects us to stand and you know these past few weeks these past few days in England there has been uh a lot of standing as they say you see you find most of these Royals and many others standing for long long hours simply because their Queen Is Dead but we are expected to stand because our God is alive says and faith can take its stand on the Rock mama [Music] the foundation and I tell you [Applause] that is look it's foreign

others if someone wants to break into a house they can even walk around for a year trying to see how are things done here where can I go through what we need to eat today can I pray and then eventually one day when he realizes he will always come through that which sport our one of white and here the Bible stories listen he is not a lion oh no but that is simple because our God is the
