need this evening I welcome you to come and be the chief guest here in this house today and perform everything God that you want to do this come and meet every need every desire of everyone and even those who are coming the way amen praise the Lord forgive me ever lived a little bit later I was delayed at my work I'm going to ask us to stand up and we read God is what we are going to read from the book of Luke we're going to look to to to to to go in the Book of Luke chapter 2 verse 25 and verses 25 to 32. what's the moment and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devote waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy spirit that he shall not see this before he had seen the Lord is Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let it thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy Word for my eyes for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of people is Israeli [Music] foreign know your promises recognize your promises recognize your promises promise can mean that one will do something either a declaration or an assurance that one will do something all that a particular thing happens declaration or an assurance that one will do something it can mean a commitment foreign by one through another to the promising oh it is I mean amen amen I promise can be a message just send me a message that for example I can I can say I can send brother Alex foreign [Music] that can also be a promise era brothers and if Brother Martin is speaking speaking more to somebody else and his organ man Andreas he would say that and Andrew promised that he will come here amen Amina let us go slowly we shall reach so it's a foreign foreign amen amen so I'm talking about the promises of God but the theme is recognizing your promise of you ubanga you cannot recognize your promises until you know where it is coming from you can't recognize your personal attack um and another thing is change into I mean single money if you know the person who made the promise to you and or money back up around here and then you know about his background it may bring you confidence and stability in you to know whether the promise will come to pass or not yes we're together you can acknowledge that if it is Andrew's promise it will come to pass however normal or some other way you can say if that promise is from Andrew I don't want to waste my time so true is now we have learned from the word that um got a promise from God the Lord appeared to him and told him that you will not die before you see the Savior hallelujah amen you will not see this until you're saying Christ that was a promise and it was a very very great promise and he walked right with God we learn a lot of things it is okay one of them when we wait in faith we will see our promises when we wait in faith Hallelujah Amina the Bible says that wait without wax is dead even the prophet talked about it in his message faith without what is dead let us see this quote where the Prophet said this statement that faith without works is the robot that forgets but because of time we shall not read there but let me try to expound what took place one day the prophet was preaching again now he was having a prayer line a young man came around um the boy was dating what is getting foreign and and Prophet told him do you believe the Lord again after some within that service he came back and said he came and told the prophet but you told me that if I go home if I go I shall be well but I'm still begetting again the prophet told him but you believe then the boy said yes so after some time the boy came back it will not believe it is I believe that now in the message the boy went home and and the prophet went somewhere to preach in another country so when the boy went home he went with this one so when he reached home he said I am well yeah he would always speak I got healed in the name of Allah is wrong they both said the prophet told me that I will be healed in the name of Jesus I'm Healed the child everywhere they see she hold them here we are saying um one day even the visitors were still around and and the Vista said I I would imagine such a preacher who would tell uh this boy such words he deserves I am healed the Wonder the boy came in the morning when they were there and shouted the boys they took him to the doctor they checked him um and the doctor said the child is okay um they took the boy to the church where he wished to fellowship and they said the boy is well so do you see do you see that faith that is faced with actions the boy believed and he did all corresponding actions to his faith amen men and the boy got healed so in Waiting upon the Lord we must have hope God proves his word there is no ability he proves his word yes what you do is to wait upon him in faith a however you recognize the promise money immune knew that he will see the Savior and I trust that he could pray yes hallelujah amen and his Hope was not blessed in a man it's not a circumstance [Music] no he placed his hope in God [Music] so we should learn to praise our hope in God and we should never lose hope if you recognize your promise and God promised you believe us we have so many promised this book the word of the Lord is full of promises um so the promise may may have a Time bound others may not have a Time somebody may give you a promise that means that God told Abraham that you shall have a child no he never told him the man was old he was very very old we shall see it in the message proving his word Abraham was very old amen I mean but God with the captain wow Hallelujah remember they're looking for it he proves God proves his word he proves his promise Abraham in his age the prophet says notice it was unscientific science for a man of a hundred years old foreign [Music] [Music] it's impossible go to the hospital and make ready for that for the mother to have the baby again or whatever it would be if you want to compare it with this age they would call him he is out of his mind but God said in God said and he the Bible said in Romans 4 chapter in Romans 4 that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God giving praise to God for he endeavored as as seeing him who is invisible and was satisfied on holding fast for he was fully persuaded that God that what God promised foreign and the salad to become a young woman and had a baby yes [Music] lived 45 years later he's a prophet his words they lived 45 years later but Abraham remarried again at that already he remarried severeign [Music] foreign [Music] and Scientifics science Whatever It Is God proves that he is always proves his word he is right all others are wrong praise the Lord God proves his foreign I don't know what you're going through but wait Abraham waited and God gave him more than one yeah to have faith and your faith at work and then you wait upon the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah amen another thing you should do not judge yeah if you know and recognize your promise you can know it when it it becomes uh revealed age and if you have been moving in that promise whatever the first thing know your promise when you know it the time will occur s and you will recognize it but if you did not recognize your your promise in the first place you cannot know when it is because because Simeon maybe he was doing something maybe he was in the garden and the Holy Spirit because the whole now there was a man just in Jerusalem and called this human it's a Bitcoin Hallelujah men he was now there was a man in jail Southern called Simeon who was righteous and devote he was waiting for the consolation of Israel and he was waiting for the promise he waited and waited and waited his answer might have come differently yeah before it came in the form of a baby for him he was waiting to see a savior but the one who gave him the promise never identified how the Savior will come however the coming of the Savior was prophesies but the promise was next to the Charlie a virgin um now you know yeah so probably Simian would have thought that maybe a child will be born somewhere in Africa and then probably by the time you will see him he will be all see the Promise came in the form of a baby we had been watching for it and knew the answer when together but but how do you recognize it if you knew that that promise will happen where is the Lord so we must have faith and believe that he will reveal us what he promised to be cool the other issue that we are learning from Simeon we must hold to God these promises foreign knows how much younger he was when this reveal this Revelation came to him Yeti yeah it is like Abraham Ibrahim just trusted God yesterday if God said he would see the Messiah then it was so trusted to the Lord to bring about the circumstances the Lord to bring about the circumstances necessary to make it so yeah yes praise the Lord we should hold to God's promise if we say come away if the Lord said that he will sleep in peace in your house but right now there is no peace you will see foreign [Music] you may be sick God Is A Healer he heals we know it God Is A Healer praise the Lord foreign praise the Lord in Luke 8 43 to 40 8. [Music] let us take that reading summer is okay yes [Music] foreign and the Bible says she had given all she had and she could not give no more doctors why but when she had she took faith then she said that if I immediately touch at the Hem of His Garment I will be healed that is faith foreign [Music] see because you're gonna Jesus of Nazareth yes why do you come what did you want from us can you imagine Demons recognize Jesus you know how demons speak what do you want from us they recognized him but the body think it even us believers do not know that Jesus heals us you need to know that Jesus heals he promised and he fulfilled his wife on Earth whether I cast or a demon Jesus just cast it before the Lord and say Lord here I am sick and you say I shall be healed by the strikes by his strikes we were him um praise the Lord sometimes when you have a promise you can come to a place when you are really you you really you have no strength and you become frustrated by some circumstances some Temptations maybe more see and then and and you lose hope Soviet we know that but it's not to be money don't things happen but don't lose hope now yes take your hope to the Lord [Music] oh yeah also Satan has promises so it is good to recognize your promise and you know where it is coming from now whatever one time Satan promised Jesus that I can give you the whole world I promise that if you would worship me I would give and true let me tell you brothers and sisters they don't last long they have strings are attached he can give you money for a year but when God is promise comes you get peace with it you get peace in that promise praise the Lord reached unto his promise you spoke now foreign when I read it Bible and I think about it I really feel like as if I want to cry if the Lord promise fulfills your promise you you you you you you you you're filled with joy episodes I pray that the Lord will give you your promises if you know them that he will fulfill them for you Hallelujah I mean the Israel is past he was fulfilling his promise he had promised he had the promise that he shall redeem them selves and walk by the promise it may seem to be impossible is it impossible to the extent that people need to pass through the radius praise the Lord amen it is just maybe it is just to construct a house a number foreign [Music] Gates through he Gates you through the construction numbers the house to be your priority you may be there having money and doing it with other things I'm using it as an example onto that promise anterioration services [Music] give everything to him [Music] if you begin doing things by yourself he will leave it for you if you put it into a human being that he will help me God will move out in the high school we had a member of parliament at home for eight years when I finished my senior school I was sure I will go at campus foreign praise the Lord come here that was Where My Hope was indeed there was him again again I sat for two years praise the Lord and in 2016. there was general elections do you know what God did I am the one who used to cut the money to go in campaigns back we waste your money put in in in our books a box where your sister is for two months and in the general election was the only person trusted to carry the money we sat in the spot custom every day for 60 days after after by election then we lost and we came in back Independence but I'm telling you we spent about every day in the morning I could go with about City Millions we go in the field it gets finished [Music] yeah I started University without the Member of Parliament support if it was there it's less than 300 000. University put your trust in God not in your husband not in your relatives but when you put your trust in God uses whoever he wants to not be the person you're putting your trust Ed praise the Lord did he promise yes will make it Abraham got her son when he was very old there was no possibility he believed and God made it praise the Lord after graduation finished like my brother in 2019. I I did not get a job okay I got a job a small job and then go with the two kids and then we went back in campaign of 2011.

[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] hmm praise the Lord our God is a deliverer foreign when they were tied up again the Lord said your God shall save you let him come on that is the mistake foreign if he just is through them there maybe but he made a mistake and spoke the promise he challenged God yes his student came yeah did he say he will save you from your enemies if you worship him alone without adding anything to him watch and see their lover what amazes me is that when those boys were in fire away but he came down on himself foreign [Music] the Daniel come out by e it means they were

called Daniel the following day and say Daniel did your God save you today [Music] praise the Lord what are we learning let's put our trust in the Lord always keep out trust in the Lord always because

shall redeem you from the Egyptians foreign [Music] God will fulfill his promise pop it up December you the last one we must be Holy Ghost controls because in the scripture we have read here [Music]

the temple when the parents brought any Dutch out Jesus to do for him what the customer of the law Simeon took himself the Holy Spirit to control him and the Holy Spirit in his life the spirit of God

every moment every song that is sung today every word that we have had you designed and prepared and planned that this will be the day we shall come to your house and be encouraged and be reminded about the promises that you have made Lord Minister has stood and he has spoken and reminded us of many people that received promises from you but father I do not remember hearing of any of them that say that he was given a promise and you never fulfilled it Lord we have heard about Sarah we have heard about Abraham fulfilled their promise Lord your promise that you meant to them Lord father we have heard about Simeon we have heard about all these men and women that waited and waited some for very many years but your promise never fell to the ground because you are God and your God by yourself when you speak your word is forever settled in heaven and it behooves us to believe everyone no matter what we see around us no matter what defaults us no matter what we don't feel or what we feel no matter what the devil might even try to do in our lives and our families in our homes father the day for no doubt has done so much against us but our faith is not in what the devil has done our faith is in the promises that you have made for us if we believe we are your children then we know we are hairs with you and Lord we know we have a lot of promises that are even yet unfulfilled and every one of them must be fulfilled Lord we are resting on that we know that you can never fail any of your children Lord we are not going to rest on the Promises of the devil the devil will also have promises he will give like a gift to Jesus told Jesus to bow down and worship him and then he would give him the whole world the devil would want to lie to us and show us the things of the world and tell us if we can only be able to to worship Him and worship in the world pride of life the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh that you will give us all these things father we will not bow we will not Bend we will be like those brothers who walked into the fire they said we will not bow we will not bear we know that our God will fulfill his promise alone like the devil made a mistake that time to throw them in the fire when they had a promise The Devil Makes a mistake if he throws any of us in the fire because we have a promise and how the king told Daniel that your God will save you father if you are someone you always sure if our enemy intimidates you you are assure you will never disappoint any of your children father you never disappoint any little one you never disappoint Lord even the youngest among us father you are a promise keeper oh Hallelujah we worship you father we give you praise we give you honor and we are saying Lord we believe in you we trust in you we have confidence in your promises father Lord you promised also that if we give you will bless us it is in your word and now we are going to give and I believe the Lord you will keep that promise and you will bless every one of us father and as we give Lord to your work I pray that you will give bless every giver and may you continue to provide for each and every one of us father we give you praise in Jesus name amen amen Hallelujah we are going to sing we make a promise keeper that I I want to tell you that in my home for two days now I've been reading we have been reading Psalms Psalms 11 and Psalms 11 begins with um in the Lord put I my trust and with the children I was trying to teach them that we should not put our trust in the people in things we should always put our trust in God because our God can never disappoint us so God bless you and God bless uh how many have been blessed by the service this evening let us give a clap of praise to the Lord amen God bless you rather
