[38:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[39:28] Jesus Christ
[39:36] let us go
[39:39] praise God
[39:41] let us uh just go a little uh in verse
[39:46] 17 of chapter 18.
[39:58] shall I hid from Abraham that which I do
[40:05] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[40:07] a great and mighty nation
[40:13] and all the nations
[40:21] 20 and the Lord said
[40:24] because the Cry of Sodom and Gomer is
[40:28] great
[40:30] because they are sin is very Grievous
[40:35] I will go down now
[40:38] and see whether they have done all
[40:40] together according to the cryos
[40:55] [Music]
[41:08] so when God disclosed about his plan
[41:12] towards Sodom and gomola to Abraham
[41:17] yeah
[41:19] I have my brother there
[41:28] his family
[41:31] to plead for Lotus family

[41:47] and his Illusions
[41:52] praise God hallelujah so he pleaded
[41:57] Universe
[42:02] within the city
[42:06] now this was Abraham
[42:09] physically
[42:11] would that also destroy and not spare
[42:14] the place for the 50 righteous that are
[42:17] thereiness
[42:31] to select the righteous with the wicked
[42:35] under the righteous should be as the

[42:59] [Music]
[43:04] then I'll spare all the place for their
[43:06] sakes
[43:09] now this was Abraham pleading for the
[43:12] Saints or for the righteous ones all the
[43:14] cities of Sodom and gomeran
[43:19] because his brother was in Sodom he knew
[43:22] it very well
[43:25] and by now he thought maybe he's having
[43:28] his wife his children and his in-laws
[43:38] praise God so he kept on breeding yeah

[43:50] have taken upon me to speak unto the
[43:52] Lord which I am but dust and Ashes
[43:55] foreign
[44:08] [Music]
[45:18] he came to uh
[45:22] verse 32 and he said oh let you know the
[45:24] Lord be angry I'll speak yet but this
[45:27] once
[45:34] shall be found there
[45:56] because he never knew very well what was
[45:59] the number of lotus lotus family
[46:09] maybe they are
[46:12] 30. till when he reached at number 10.
[46:59] [Music]

[47:21] praise God
[47:23] [Music]
[47:29] they even never wanted to think about
[47:31] God in their mind
[47:34] praise God so God decided to destroy
[47:38] these cities
[47:40] to get them out of the sight of the
[47:43] world
[47:44] praise God so these Angels Came
[47:48] In The House of Lords to seek for his
[47:53] family

[49:58] coming
[49:59] the people of Sodom we are seeing them
[50:04] they entered into the House of Lords
[50:08] so the Bible says these men of Sodom
[50:11] came and surrounded the House of Lords
[50:16] with a purpose of getting out these
[50:19] angels
[50:21] and take them for homosexuality
[50:25] praise God because they were the cities
[50:29] that turned out to be
[50:32] that many never wanted to sleep with
[50:34] their wives
[50:38] they wanted to sit with their fellow men
[50:42] praise God that's how sinful the city of
[50:45] Sodom foreign
[50:54] [Music]
[51:55] he wanted to sleep with the angels
[51:59] because their desires

[52:09] perverted

[53:33] men out and they know them
[53:37] lost try to pleading
[53:40] an extent that he had his two daughters
[53:45] who are still virgins
[53:48] they were staying with him
[53:50] praise God
[54:13] [Music]
[54:49] their desires that go and God perverted
[54:54] [Music]
[54:59] an extent that even this man wrote the
[55:02] righteous man by in the city the only
[55:04] righteous one okay
[55:07] now even we find that lot was just a
[55:10] borderline believer
[55:17] foreign
[55:43] [Music]
[56:31] foreign let us proceed
[56:35] actually they even wanted to break the
[56:38] door to pick the Angels by force
[56:43] and they attempted the two
[56:46] praise God first thing but the men put
[56:50] forth their hands
[56:54] now when they talk about the men they
[56:56] are talking about the Angels
[57:00] but the men put forth their hand and put
[57:03] lot into the house
[57:07] [Music]
[57:22] small and great
[57:25] so that they they worried themselves to
[57:29] find adults
[57:50] [Music]
[58:29] bring them out of this place
[58:32] foreign
[58:58] to the message to save whosoever shall
[59:00] free to the message
[59:05] praise God amen hallelujah amen so he
[59:08] sent his angels
[59:15] at the hearing of the message
[59:18] so the Angels told the Lord
[59:24] and tell your daughters go and tell your
[59:28] your friends
[59:29] and tell everyone you would wish today
[59:34] Mighty free because of Destruction is

[59:42] because destruction was going to set in
[59:45] a few minutes
[59:50] for we will destroy this place verse 13.
[59:56] because the Cry of them is waxing great
[59:59] before the face of the Lord
[1:00:04] and the Lord has sent us
[1:00:11] and Lord went out and speak unto his
[1:00:15] sons
[1:00:17] praise God

[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:17:59] we shall start from verse 38 to Japan
[1:18:05] and see what the lord requires
[1:18:10] Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:18:19] what God requires from you as a Believer
[1:18:24] as a Christian you claim to be a
[1:18:28] Christian
[1:18:30] hallelujah hallelujah because in the
[1:18:32] first time
[1:18:36] the Bible says for this is good
[1:18:40] acceptable in the sight of Our Lord
[1:18:44] praise God hallelujah like all men to
[1:18:47] get saved
[1:18:48] but when you get saved
[1:18:52] praise God to come to the knowledge
[1:18:57] the whole truth
[1:18:59] of the Bible foreign
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:04] whatever the Bible tells you to do you
[1:20:06] do Bible check down but you're not
[1:20:08] called when it tells you not to do you
[1:20:10] don't but I'm not talking okay don't say
[1:20:13] this was for Paul
[1:20:14] this was supposed idea for me I think
[1:20:18] the Bible here because the Bible yet
[1:20:20] again that's how they listen the word of
[1:20:22] God
[1:20:25] to eat the Lambs
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:33] so that is why when we get saved yes we
[1:20:37] have to come to the holy truth
[1:20:45] hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:20:48] hallelujah now they just shall live by
[1:20:50] faith
[1:20:52] but if
[1:20:57] my soul shall have no pressure
[1:21:02] when you come to him when time comes and
[1:21:06] you draw back I don't know
[1:21:10] his uh
[1:21:13] he he uh he's he has no his soul has no
[1:21:17] pressure in any person that draws back
[1:21:20] [Music]
[1:21:22] praise God he wants you to come out and
[1:21:26] then you go forward
[1:21:29] that is why he told the church that you
[1:21:32] remember what his wife yes
[1:21:37] because she get she got out of the city
[1:21:40] but then she looked back
[1:21:43] she received a message
[1:21:48] but then she took half of the message
[1:21:51] she said I love this this one I want to
[1:21:55] do it
[1:21:57] but that one I won't take it you know
[1:22:00] praise God he said remember
[1:22:04] praise God
[1:22:09] praise God the Church of God
[1:22:13] so today in the same way
[1:22:18] we are being told never to draw back to
[1:22:22] them
[1:22:23] praise God for doing this the very
[1:22:27] things that we used to do
[1:22:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:40] but of them that believe to be saving of
[1:22:44] their soul
[1:22:47] now that was post-confession
[1:22:52] and it should be your confession
[1:23:01] praise God I am to go forwards and take
[1:23:05] it to again
[1:23:10] praise God
[1:23:40] [Music]

[1:25:48] Lotus wives influences
[1:25:52] [Music]

[1:26:51] I mean
[1:26:52] Hallelujah listen what he says
[1:26:58] 1964.02 15.
[1:27:01] influences amen he says I think if we
[1:27:05] had the people today then there was a
[1:27:07] singer today our churches who claim to
[1:27:10] be Christians
[1:27:13] if they would abstain from the things of
[1:27:16] the world
[1:27:19] and live that kind of a life
[1:27:22] it would influence the younger
[1:27:25] Christians
[1:27:28] praise God but today
[1:27:31] when they let down and
[1:27:34] drinks
[1:27:41] and still try to hold their confessions
[1:28:02] now that is the problem the church has
[1:28:05] got these days
[1:28:07] the problem the church has changed
[1:28:11] some people's legs are in the world
[1:28:16] and the other one in church
[1:28:20] praise God he comes from boosting then
[1:28:23] he comes in church
[1:28:26] yet he says I am a believer
[1:28:30] praise God but what comes to such people
[1:28:34] if they don't repentance
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:43] because she received the whole message
[1:28:47] then she took half of it
[1:28:50] she said this is for the pastor

[1:36:43] foreign
[1:37:17] goronaku
[1:37:19] and turn the dark negurioca
[1:37:23] the Stars didn't come out to give its
[1:37:26] life
[1:37:30] with locks
[1:37:32] and the Earth burst forth with the Lord
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:51] and ripped the Tampa Bay from the top to
[1:37:54] the bottom
[1:38:00] and the people running and screaming
[1:38:05] they didn't know what had taken place
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:31] but it was too late
[1:38:35] he looked and believed
[1:38:39] but it was too late
[1:38:41] for him to believe
[1:38:44] what he had done had sealed his Doom
[1:38:48] yeah
[1:38:53] he had ran the spear through the
[1:38:56] savior's heart
[1:39:02] it was too late
[1:39:06] I wonder how many Romans today have done
[1:39:09] the same thing
[1:39:13] and they will do the same thing
[1:39:18] you might look someday
[1:39:21] but it might look too late
[1:39:28] will come in that day and be the same
[1:39:31] way
[1:39:33] praise God hallelujah hallelujah says
[1:39:54] he had PS3
[1:39:57] and that was too late for him
[1:40:00] he had had all the messages
[1:40:06] praise God but then it was too late for
[1:40:09] him
[1:40:10] because time was over Hallelujah
[1:40:16] he had already made his judgment
[1:40:21] there was no extrus for him
[1:40:26] the same thing that happened to Lotus
[1:40:28] wife
[1:40:30] she had had a message from the two
[1:40:33] angels
[1:40:35] who are The Messengers
[1:40:39] praise God but when she decided to
[1:40:42] intentionally turn and looked back again
[1:40:54] so when we intentionally do what the
[1:40:57] Bible tells us never to do it together
[1:41:01] praise God
[1:41:04] we might cross
[1:41:14] Mercy away
[1:41:19] and then we might find ourselves on a
[1:41:21] judgment days
[1:41:23] in the same way
[1:41:31] what am I trying to say
[1:41:35] that they see they clearly Vindicated
[1:41:38] the word
[1:41:41] like pilate
[1:41:43] and the rest of them
[1:41:46] like the Roman soldiers
[1:41:49] but are you going to wait too late to do
[1:41:53] anything about it
[1:41:59] hallelujah hallelujah he should have
[1:42:02] used the spear the other way
[1:42:08] those will be closed
[1:42:11] like it was in the days
[1:42:15] and then it is too late
[1:42:21] Hallelujah so Church of God
[1:42:24] what does God requires a
[1:42:29] once we came out of the world
[1:42:32] let us not look back like

[1:42:55] praise God hallelujah hallelujah

[1:43:12] what will the prophet a man in Matthew

[1:43:27] this is what the Lord asked
[1:43:31] praise God the lord requires

[1:43:44] because first of all no one who
[1:43:46] constrained you to come to Christ
[1:43:49] when you had a gospel
[1:43:53] then you said this is the truth
[1:43:58] Hallelujah

[1:44:38] everywhere that God is
[1:44:49] the world is God and see against it the
[1:44:52] word is
[1:44:54] so it cannot failure
[1:44:59] doesn't make a difference
