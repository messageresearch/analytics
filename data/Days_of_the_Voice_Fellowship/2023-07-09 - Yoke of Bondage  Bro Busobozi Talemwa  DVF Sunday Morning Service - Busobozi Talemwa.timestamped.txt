[59:56] give the club a praise for the Lord who
[1:00:00] set us free and died for us hallelujah
[1:00:10] bondage
[1:00:14] but you already know that someone has
[1:00:16] said to you
[1:00:47] there is a song We singed which says he
[1:00:50] set me free
[1:00:52] from the chains
[1:00:55] I thank Jesus
[1:01:01] I thank God for he set me free I don't
[1:01:06] know whether you have ever seen a free
[1:01:08] man
[1:01:10] a free woman will be happy
[1:01:14] a free man a free woman
[1:01:17] foreign
[1:02:12] between the two natures
[1:02:16] each of us have those two Natures
[1:02:29] praise the Lord so we are going to
[1:02:32] Romans 7.
[1:02:37] Brother Sam I need my real sound
[1:02:40] Romans 7 14.
[1:02:47] if you can take your Bible and open
[1:02:49] there with me if you have a Bible at all
[1:02:54] those with Bible say Amen as your
[1:02:56] opening
[1:02:59] without Bibles you can hold your peace
[1:03:01] no problem
[1:03:06] foreign
[1:03:12] so we're reading out of Romans chapter 7
[1:03:14] verse 14 and we are going to read a few
[1:03:16] verses out of there so we can be able to
[1:03:18] see how he explains these two natures
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:32] so we're beginning from 14.
[1:03:34] for we know that the law is spiritual
[1:03:37] but I am Kano sold under sin TV
[1:03:53] Hallelujah
[1:03:55] for that which I do allow not
[1:03:59] for what I would that do I not but what
[1:04:05] I hate that do I
[1:04:08] change
[1:04:17] if then I do that which I would not I
[1:04:22] consent unto the law that it is
[1:04:31] just trying to bring me back to do what
[1:04:34] is good
[1:04:38] he began by saying the law is spiritual
[1:04:42] attention
[1:04:43] so you see on Wednesday I spoke on
[1:04:46] legalism
[1:04:52] [Applause]
[1:04:55] because what I want to do I don't find
[1:04:58] myself doing
[1:05:01] so I can concern that the law is good
[1:05:06] but he says now then it is no more I
[1:05:10] that do it
[1:05:12] but sin that do anything
[1:05:16] since
[1:05:20] meaning within me
[1:05:23] I have a desire to do well
[1:05:26] but I find myself doing this
[1:05:34] because it always keeps me away from
[1:05:37] doing that
[1:05:40] but then he says it is not I that do
[1:05:43] those bad things
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:49] for I know that in me that is in my
[1:05:53] flesh
[1:05:56] there is no good thing
[1:05:59] oh my God I don't know whether you knew
[1:06:01] that is
[1:06:06] I want to say to you there is no good
[1:06:09] things
[1:06:12] foreign
[1:06:19] he says there is no good thing
[1:06:24] for to will is present with me
[1:06:29] but how to perform that which is good I
[1:06:33] find notes
[1:06:40] I'll not ask you to raise up your hands
[1:06:43] but I'll ask you how many have ever felt
[1:06:46] that way
[1:06:51] you you have a desire
[1:06:55] loving you
[1:07:30] which has been tied up and put somewhere
[1:07:33] in a glass
[1:07:39] and then it rains and the water begins
[1:07:43] to flow
[1:07:45] when it sees outside and says the wallow
[1:07:54] I really really want to do that
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:28] you can try to keep it inside
[1:08:31] you can try to keep it inside
[1:08:34] but actually you can never change its
[1:08:38] nature does
[1:08:40] because it has been a peak to begin with
[1:09:44] foreign foreign
[1:10:37] foreign
[1:11:05] it is no more either do it but sin that
[1:11:08] do anything
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:11] Cola
[1:11:13] they
[1:11:16] say
[1:11:19] Hallelujah man hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:22] someone asked me is it possible for a
[1:11:24] seat of a baptized
[1:11:27] son or daughter of God to make a mistake
[1:11:31] um
[1:11:35] oh yes because the body you're wearing
[1:11:38] is not baptized with the Holy
[1:11:42] ghosts
[1:11:44] look you see then who is the judge of
[1:11:47] that
[1:11:49] it's God who looks at the internet
[1:11:53] this is someone who is a child of God
[1:11:56] you cannot utterly say
[1:11:59] Let Me Go and sing God will forgive me
[1:12:08] you can never do that because within
[1:12:11] your heart
[1:12:12] something will tell you you cannot do
[1:12:16] that you may try please
[1:12:25] find yourself in an era where Sangamon
[1:12:29] Soviet was taken not one Guru and a Mr
[1:12:34] in an area
[1:12:38] well then of course if that happens
[1:12:41] what is going to happen afterwards
[1:12:44] shows which seed is in you
[1:12:50] is
[1:12:56] you have two people here
[1:13:00] one is Cain and another is
[1:13:03] you see you can see what they did after
[1:13:06] dinner could not repent
[1:13:10] look at look at Peter and look at uh
[1:13:14] what is the name of this Judas you know
[1:13:17] when when when when Judas both of them
[1:13:19] did the same scene
[1:13:23] and Peter was a seed of God
[1:13:29] that's what the Bible says actually
[1:13:32] Jesus said that Judas maybe was the
[1:13:36] Devil Himself
[1:13:48] of God is God
[1:13:50] and therefore that's why he called Judas
[1:13:53] of the Devil Himself
[1:13:56] so when when when Peter sinned over you
[1:14:00] know now how did his sin he rejected
[1:14:02] Christ
[1:14:04] Jesus Christ foreign
[1:15:03] then he came before
[1:15:17] some people who say that there is no
[1:15:19] repentance in a message because
[1:15:20] everything is done the price Redemption
[1:15:23] has been paid we don't repentance
[1:15:26] yes yes
[1:15:29] let me tell you we still repent
[1:15:33] we still repent to change that's the old
[1:15:36] time Holy Spirit
[1:15:48] equipment they know that God is real
[1:16:10] who don't know how to manage money they
[1:16:12] have little wisdom
[1:16:14] too
[1:16:17] so you see you that's new he had wisdom
[1:16:20] I guess and with wisdom he used
[1:16:23] reasonings
[1:16:30] see I know you're powerful so let me
[1:16:33] betray you so that we can also get the
[1:16:36] money
[1:16:37] I wanted to remember this is the same
[1:16:39] man who once told Jesus let us sell the
[1:16:41] oil and and have money to use it
[1:16:45] um
[1:16:50] and so at this time
[1:16:53] Judas Judah knew what he was doing he
[1:16:56] didn't do it out of an era okay
[1:17:01] he planned sin yeah
[1:17:08] but he knew also he had a way out
[1:17:13] they said
[1:17:15] let me get this money can't finish
[1:17:17] sentencing so that when I betray you
[1:17:21] when you reuse your device
[1:17:43] and so he watched when he came they
[1:17:47] agreed with the other man he was going
[1:17:50] to kiss that one
[1:18:49] I and Judas was there now you know what
[1:18:52] he must have shot them I know you can do
[1:18:55] this
[1:18:57] Jesus went down yes I don't know how
[1:19:01] Judas felt
[1:19:03] your master felt the anointing over him
[1:19:06] over here
[1:19:21] the tingling in his foreign
[1:20:04] foreign Jose
[1:20:19] and at that moment
[1:20:21] Judas Jesus gave himself yes to the
[1:20:25] Pharisees
[1:20:32] what is happening something must have
[1:20:35] gone wrong with my calculations
[1:21:00] that he was a real sinner
[1:21:04] he didn't mean to sing
[1:21:10] and at that moment
[1:21:19] foreign
[1:21:57] all humans can sin
[1:22:01] but the seed of God can never plan
[1:22:03] sinning
[1:23:04] foreign
[1:23:29] hallelujah amen and at that moment he
[1:23:32] says
[1:23:36] that when I would do good evil is
[1:23:39] present with me
[1:23:50] verse
[1:24:01] for the light in the law of God after
[1:24:04] the inward man
[1:24:11] but I see another law in my members
[1:24:13] worrying against the law of my mind and
[1:24:16] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:24:19] sin which is in my members
[1:24:31] and he says
[1:24:38] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:24:41] this day
[1:24:51] yes
[1:24:56] you know what Psalms 51 says behold I
[1:24:59] was sharpened in iniquity
[1:25:02] and then send it my mother conceive me
[1:25:06] foreign
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:26:06] foreign
[1:26:25] you can have the Holy Spirit in you
[1:26:28] in that new nature of yours
[1:26:31] but let me ask you which one do you
[1:26:35] think will be
[1:26:36] stronger money
[1:26:40] the one you feed most
[1:26:44] the white one because it's white
[1:26:47] and many Christians are like that
[1:26:49] because
[1:26:50] God is powerful
[1:26:54] but if you don't feed that word
[1:26:58] if you don't feed you're a white dog
[1:27:03] you will live in a defeated life
[1:27:09] you will live
[1:27:12] just live in sin
[1:27:16] but the purpose of the world
[1:27:19] is to come
[1:27:24] this nature this York it's you know you
[1:27:27] know it has yoked us we keep us in
[1:27:30] bondage
[1:27:33] you see the law could not Deliver Us
[1:27:35] from this York the anime
[1:27:38] I had a picture of a York but I forgot
[1:27:41] to give it to the brothers
[1:27:43] um but brother Isaac if you can find one

[1:27:46] now the York like we don't know it much
[1:27:48] yet because we don't use them a lot
[1:27:54] can I have two brothers who are ready to
[1:27:56] act like a cow here

[2:00:55] I go to church
[2:01:07] we need to go higher than that

[2:02:13] which means the preachers
[2:02:15] he came to the sound of the trumpet
[2:02:19] but they said
[2:02:21] we were not here
