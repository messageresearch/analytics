[30:57] speak to us today
[31:02] oh you're great
[31:20] but if our gospel behave it is here to
[31:22] them that are lost
[31:24] in whom the god of this world has
[31:26] blinded the minds of them which believe
[31:29] not
[31:30] lest the light of the glorious gospel
[31:32] gospel of christ who is the image of god
[31:36] should shine unto them
[31:44] welcome
[32:14] i'd like to greet you all in the
[32:16] precious name of jesus christ my name
[32:26] is evening i just want i just have a
[32:29] small
[32:31] uh
[32:32] subject to speak on congress
[32:37] i want to speak about a blind generation
[32:40] to the
[32:46] [Music]
[33:03] [Music]
[33:06] it's not only this generation it's also
[33:08] all the generations before this
[33:09] generation
[33:14] america the the generations before us
[33:18] and even now it's been blinded to the
[33:21] fulfillment of prophecy a million
[33:49] and the holy spirit can be able to flow
[33:50] very well
[33:54] and we all can be able to connect to him
[34:01] am i speaking to somebody tonight
[34:06] it won't hurt if you respond every now
[34:07] and then
[34:11] so these generations and whenever god
[34:13] does something the people do not see
[34:16] what he is doing
[34:17] then at that moment
[34:25] they are usually so much in love with
[34:28] being able to recognize what god was
[34:31] doing and what god will do but not what
[34:33] god is doing
[34:45] but we want to be a generation that will
[34:49] be able to see
[34:51] the fulfillment of prophecy
[34:59] if there is one thing that is so bad is
[35:02] to be blind
[35:05] [Music]
[35:07] if you are blind you cannot be able to
[35:09] see
[35:09] the beauty of the things that god
[35:11] created
[35:13] [Music]
[35:18] if you are blind you cannot be able to
[35:20] see the beautiful flowers
[35:26] if you are blind you cannot know that
[35:28] there is yellow black red and blue
[35:35] you cannot even know purple yellow and
[35:37] green
[35:41] why because you are blind
[35:45] blind only knows black and dark oh
[35:50] yeah
[35:52] that's why it is so bad to be blind
[36:11] and now that is if physical blindness is
[36:14] that bad
[36:19] much more spiritual blindness
[36:35] the subject i'm speaking on actually was
[36:37] inspired by my sharing with him
[37:05] amen we are talking about blindness
[37:09] my subject is a blind generation to the
[37:11] fulfillment of prophecy
[37:20] you see and i was speaking about a
[37:21] physical blind man or woman
[37:26] if you are blind you cannot be able to
[37:28] see the beauty that god has made
[37:34] you see if you look around now you'll be
[37:36] able to see green the green flowers and
[37:38] then you know everything oh you will
[37:40] love it
[37:46] you know people go out to the beach
[37:48] maybe to rest a while and they go in the
[37:49] wild maybe to just enjoy their nature
[37:58] you see that kind of going out cannot be
[38:01] as as
[38:02] enterprising without your
[38:04] ability to see now
[38:09] [Music]
[38:11] it is more beautiful it is more real if
[38:14] you can see the beauty and then
[38:28] you will be able to understand
[38:48] [Music]
[38:57] you know they will not be able to see
[38:59] the kingdom of god if not born again
[39:06] you see they cannot be able to see
[39:09] that means to understand
[39:16] [Applause]
[39:35] to be blind he robs you of the ability
[39:38] that god intended for the humankind
[40:10] that is what we call spiritual blindness
[40:16] people all over the generations have had
[40:19] spiritual blindness around 2 million
[40:28] [Music]
[40:37] he's like you are cast you're doomed
[40:39] forever
[40:48] and we see here in the book
[41:46] we
[41:58] baptism in the name of our lord
[42:06] [Music]
[42:26] has blinded
[42:28] the mind
[42:50] the only reason why someone would be
[42:52] spiritually blinded and sooner you could
[42:55] achievement
[43:41] [Applause]
[43:50] he wants them all to come to the full
[45:01] do you know what happened to them
[45:58] in the power of the arena
[46:01] it was good childhood that the gospel be
[46:04] brought to you fast
[46:08] but because you have rejected it
[46:20] hallelujah
[46:52] amen in holiness and righteousness
[47:08] we believe in the holy
[47:50] amen what is it
[47:59] [Music]
[48:17] [Music]
[48:44] is
[49:14] oh
[50:52] such men
[50:59] [Music]
[51:20] just read a question of a quote from the
[51:22] message israel and the church
[51:30] god is what must every time be fulfilled
[51:50] you think you are getting by
[51:55] but just remember
[51:57] young man

[56:41] because now you can make yourself right
[57:10] your
[57:24] i am not preaching

[58:43] that cries in the wilderness

[59:26] wilderness
[59:28] prepare yes the way of the lord and man
[59:35] for our god
[59:37] amen
[59:38] i want to ask you a question
[59:41] what did the scripture say
[59:43] what you gonna be a voice
[59:45] where is it crying from it
[59:48] from the wilderness
[59:50] from the palace
[59:52] from the temple
[59:54] from a big church
[59:56] from where
[59:58] wilderness
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:56] gonna do show us that voice
[1:03:59] save you this man
[1:04:01] i don't know about it
[1:04:08] john the baptist was a son of one of the
[1:04:11] priests

[1:04:18] i said did you hear that
[1:04:20] day john the baptist
[1:04:23] was a son of zechariah

[1:04:56] the priest
[1:04:59] the priest
[1:05:00] was blind
[1:05:05] the priest was blind
[1:05:08] so
[1:05:09] spiritually not physical
[1:05:13] are you following me
[1:05:16] and the age of the lord spoke to him
[1:06:02] if you don't

[1:07:47] and elizabeth knew that even if the
[1:07:49] child looked dead
[1:07:53] there is a promise

[1:31:01] you we see together that the star
[1:31:04] dominion appeared yeah just like stars
[1:31:07] appeared in our generation
[1:31:11] and we are following that story
[1:31:14] they followed that
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:56] it a moment here
[1:31:58] to ticket
[1:31:59] by that time
[1:32:02] israel was under the rulership of rome
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:08] the roman empire at that time was ruling
[1:32:24] they were seeing him as their savior
[1:32:27] from the bondage of rome
[1:32:34] that's what they believe
[1:32:36] so the romans knew about the prophecy
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:33:20] and they
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:00] so we can also go ahead
[1:34:44] these men walked away
[1:34:48] and when they reached the place but i
[1:34:50] had to communicate the pharisees
[1:34:51] also my father
[1:34:53] told them
[1:34:54] tell us
[1:34:56] but actually the pharisees i'm afraid i
[1:34:58] don't
[1:35:04] [Laughter]
[1:35:09] but because they maybe had their own
[1:35:11] vaginas they had
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:36:08] and that's how they they went to the
[1:36:10] king again
[1:36:12] and the king told them like that
[1:36:14] they were confused
[1:36:15] let me tell you come on whenever you
[1:36:17] leave
[1:36:19] they start you get confused
[1:37:04] all right i'm approaching the finishing
[1:37:05] line here
[1:37:07] and so i walked by
[1:37:10] and walked and walked
[1:37:13] appeared
[1:37:16] they were excited
[1:37:29] for the prophet he sent today
[1:37:38] [Applause]

[1:39:27] and say it is born again
[1:39:31] you know jesus always comes to the
[1:39:32] despise
[1:39:35] the bible says that he reveals that he
[1:39:37] hid himself from the wise and the
[1:39:39] prudent of the world and he he revealed
[1:39:41] himself
[1:39:43] [Music]
