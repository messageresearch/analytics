[49:55] it is where you are
[50:24] [Music]
[50:34] when jesus called us yes where peter we
[50:36] did not come to make us dummies director
[50:41] you can't do anything you can't go
[50:43] anywhere you can't watch anything you
[50:44] can't listen to anything
[50:49] they only carry you to church and back
[50:51] at home
[51:09] [Music]
[51:19] so it's what you are doing and where
[51:22] else
[51:28] follow me and i will make you fishers of
[51:30] men
[51:34] you want intended for them to remain
[51:36] fishers
[51:42] but you want the damn to be fishers of
[51:45] men
[52:02] james son of zebedee and john yeah
[52:07] and they were mending their nets
[52:10] and they called them
[52:11] and they immediately left their ships
[52:16] and their father
[52:17] went and followed him never came here to
[52:19] next time
[52:20] we are not here in the church this
[52:22] morning
[52:24] we had nothing to do
[52:28] we are not serving jesus christ
[52:31] because we had nothing to listen to
[52:34] we are worshiping and following jesus
[52:38] because this is what we were meant to do
[52:43] some people say i'm going to serve god
[52:45] because i have nothing i have nothing to
[52:46] do
[52:50] if you are serving god because you had
[52:51] nothing to do
[52:55] time will come and you will get
[52:56] something to do and you will stop
[52:58] serving god
[53:27] [Applause]
[53:54] satisfaction
[54:02] hallelujah amen so these men were
[54:04] enthused
[54:07] they were called
[54:21] but there was something you had to
[54:23] forsake
[54:26] for christ
[54:27] by the way every one of us has to
[54:29] forsake something for christ
[54:35] we have some people who do not want to
[54:36] forsake
[54:51] [Applause]
[55:04] his father
[55:17] flowing with me
[55:22] you know in business
[55:24] you cannot do a business without a risk
[55:26] does somebody call me remove that away
[55:29] you cannot do a business without a
[55:31] sacrifice
[55:44] these men were enthused with their
[55:46] calling but
[56:20] jesus did not call you
[56:22] so you become a good-for-nothing person
[56:25] yes
[56:42] and you ask them what do you do
[56:45] i'm a prayer warrior
[56:48] they are in the church every single hour
[56:50] every single day
[56:55] is it wrong to go in church every day
[56:59] but you must have something to do
[57:02] you must work or you know even just
[57:05] himself what now yes
[57:08] right
[57:10] so he did not call us they are treated
[57:12] to disappoint our life's calls
[57:17] if you're in school continue in school
[57:21] business continuing business
[57:30] [Applause]
[58:04] and he wanted to realign our
[58:06] expectations
[58:20] hallelujah

[2:35:48] but i told you those who came here on
[2:35:50] friday
[2:36:07] did not come up
[2:36:11] so
[2:36:12] i was concerned
[2:36:19] as a man i was strengthening
[2:36:30] and she kept on asking me
[2:36:34] do you really think he's okay that
[2:36:35] although
[2:36:36] do you really think he's okay
[2:36:39] you know everybody is gifted
[2:36:42] but my wife is gifted with uh
[2:36:46] uh a certain gift
[2:36:48] in
[2:37:17] did not know where to start from
[2:37:19] you know
[2:37:20] i have just finished my food no come
[2:37:22] around so i thought maybe i should
[2:37:26] die
[2:37:28] and joel was encouraging us also saying
[2:37:53] but now i have just finished my food
[2:37:55] nah come on i'm very hungry
[2:37:57] and i was not busy scenario
[2:38:00] and i saw the number you know the number
[2:38:03] i decided to pick it then
[2:38:06] so then this man speaks
[2:38:09] and says i am a updf officer
[2:38:28] if i think they're scams
[2:38:31] so i i was planning to do the same thing
[2:38:35] and then he continued speaking now
[2:38:37] you'll get up
[2:38:39] your son
[2:38:42] shame shame
[2:38:43] [Music]
[2:38:44] when he spoke that yeah
[2:38:47] i knew now that it is a problem
[2:38:49] and i knew he was not a scam
[2:38:52] he said he was knocked
[2:38:54] out
[2:38:58] [Music]
[2:39:08] but you need to come and pick him up
[2:39:09] wait i would join and take him to the
[2:39:11] hospital let me drive you
[2:39:13] so i stopped thinking
[2:39:18] my wife almost went into labour
[2:39:24] [Music]
[2:39:37] and uh i did not also tell her
[2:39:39] immediately i just walked out of the
[2:39:41] house
[2:39:43] and i remembered i have not told her
[2:39:46] when she killed my daughter
[2:39:49] is in trouble
[2:39:59] he decided to not go to their church so
[2:40:01] he can be here and help on them
[2:40:18] i drove like crazy
[2:40:21] and i reached there on the road
[2:40:24] a northern bypass someplace
[2:40:28] and uh
[2:40:30] and that this i want to say
[2:40:32] those
[2:41:00] we picked him up i noticed none of his
[2:41:03] bones were broken
[2:41:06] but he could not walk
[2:41:08] because he was unconscious quiet
[2:41:10] together and he had been there for a
[2:41:11] while
[2:41:13] but as soon as we carried him
[2:41:16] i smelled the strength of death name
[2:41:22] i did not know it was it him dying
[2:41:25] or was it death coming
[2:41:28] i did not know
[2:41:30] but i somehow also
[2:41:32] lost my mind
[2:41:35] i do not know he's eating him dying
[2:41:40] but as we were walking into the cross
[2:41:45] one of the updf officers you know there
[2:41:47] were about three of them with guns
[2:41:50] god provided watchmen over him all the
[2:41:53] time
[2:41:57] and this woman
[2:41:59] she was able to be patient
[2:42:02] she was like a mother
[2:42:04] mama uh
[2:42:06] she waited and waited until he gave the
[2:42:08] phone
[2:42:25] and this man was stopping me cutting
[2:42:27] home silicon achievement
[2:42:29] you know they were in uniform with the
[2:42:30] guy
[2:42:32] but also i mean it was a slope
[2:42:37] for such a big so the other
[2:42:50] in just a few microseconds
[2:43:40] but my wife told me later that god
[2:43:42] revealed it to her and she started
[2:43:43] praying that god revealed what was
[2:43:45] happening on the road
[2:43:58] and the man missed us
[2:44:00] just by few meters
[2:44:25] amen
[2:44:28] i cannot die
[2:44:30] but leave
[2:44:33] [Music]
[2:44:43] and so we went to the hospital and uh
[2:44:47] the doctor saw that i was bleeding
[2:44:51] you would understand if the ears
[2:44:53] bleeding it means maybe there is a brain
[2:44:54] injury or concussion somewhere or
[2:44:56] something
[2:44:59] and uh also there was a big damage we do
[2:45:02] not see even this one we saw it later
[2:45:04] that there was a a a damage on the head
[2:45:11] and
[2:45:13] so the um first of the year he quickly
[2:45:15] examined him
[2:45:17] medicine on him
[2:45:19] then he said we need to rush him to
[2:45:21] another hospital
[2:45:22] how to do a brain scan
[2:45:24] to determine whether it is a brain
[2:45:40] so later on he would come back and begin
[2:45:42] responding
[2:45:45] and so
[2:45:46] responded to instructions
[2:45:51] and then uh
[2:45:54] yesterday joe
[2:45:56] um
[2:45:57] we went to another hospital dragons
[2:46:01] to see another specialist
[2:46:04] recommendation of the doctor we had seen
[2:46:05] earlier
[2:46:22] he
[2:46:34] [Music]
[2:46:50] is it gone for good can you try that
[2:46:53] but the other side is in touch
[2:46:56] give us medication
[2:46:58] and say that uh we would need to go back
[2:47:00] after a while to go and check and do an
[2:47:02] examination
[2:47:33] who really came up i want to say god
[2:47:34] bless you but now we're going to have
[2:47:35] them come up and those who have sent
[2:47:37] prayers
[2:47:39] they never stole money but they didn't
[2:47:40] steal life
[2:47:43] and for that we are so grateful
[2:47:46] because even
[2:47:56] [Music]
