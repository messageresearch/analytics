are here and then those who are on zoom now because we will want you also to give your input regardless regarding what the lord is leading us [Music] also by the pillows family my family sarah the saints that i got that at my home peter god bless you and your wife your family i just pray that the lord will be able to speak to each and every one of you during this service amen i mean taking a part two of what we shared god bless you sister winnie for coming through and a special song and also for supporting this song amen god bless you by the way bringing down the atmosphere the right atmosphere for the world this morning so i would like us to go back again to the book of proverbs chapter 22 verse 6 [Music] although i see you came late but thank you for making the effort to come uh by the police thank you for coming here to support you amen yo okay i'm getting there versus six fingers train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it can we all read it together once again to them to jesus oh some don't have bibles now i hope that everyone has a bible constitution [Music] from it praise the lord amen you may have your seats may the lord bless us this morning that's to 12. everybody that chica video where it is i will not be very long the lord [Music] the work of the holy spirit is the subject or title that i'm looking at but i'm speaking on trained in the right atmosphere truthful trained in the right atmosphere amen you may have your streets now on sunday sunday we spoke about we also read john 16 that speaks about the spirit of truth when he comes to us and he says he will guide you into all truth now and then in galatians paul said that the law was our school master to bring us to christ we might be justified by faith now that faith has come is alive just like you are someone can i hold your mother but you have outgrown the school masters therefore you no longer need the school man when you come to the knowledge of jesus christ it does not mean that if you have received faith the law is no longer in existence now when a child is still young come on charity that child is given instruction oh i know you're awake baby that guilt that child is is told what to do oh man would you actually know and until a time when that child has grown up when they reach what we call the age of accountability that child is no longer instructed just like that she told me how to do well let me tell you guys until you're never young it is easy and now i am doing them without having her to tell me what to do but if she did not tell me what to do when i was young [Music] there are certain things you cannot learn even when you were a grown-up why do we have the intuitive mood that you showed a big and you can only learn them when you were young in our language in uganda we have a saying that you know when a tree is old so old i don't know here that something which grew up when it is already crooked when you try to make it right it will just break up so you see when a child is still young or whenever you have a chance you have an opportunity to have them shaped in the way you want them to grow for them but when they grow up you no longer have that opportunity amen he is now using that opportunity when we are still young when we are still young some of you have just believed recently if you don't get changed now they will catch you you may never change you have recently been baptized if you don't change now you [Applause] there was a wave that came some years ago and it went all over the world and many people left the message including pastors who could stand and say i preached the message for 40 years for 30 years i found out it is not the truth what is the problem was the training they never experienced the god of this message let me tell you my brother my sister if you have no testimony of the experience of the lord is because you have received a good training hallelujah amen there is no use of preaching the holy ghost who are people who are never trained and i will prove that to you by the messages if i come in the morning and i tell you receive the holy ghost but you don't know you've not been trained [Music] you cannot receive [Applause] and often times when we have two or different families whereby there is one family of our parents trying to train their children in the cabinet these children will see children from another family who have more freedom to do what they want to do when they want to do it and they will often feel as though for them they're in a prison house [Applause] and the parents of the other house will say well the parents of that house are legalistic they always constrain their children but let me tell you they can't be father or mother you only have one chance when they reach their age of accountability [Music] when someone now of course as i'm speaking about a physical child and a physical mother i wanted to look at a spiritual child and a spiritual mother come on so we see that there is also a physical child which is a spiritual child which is now the church [Music] and we see that it's a physical mother which is the church the believers are accurate these are the physical children children rather than you and the child and the mother he's the church now hallelujah amen the the the the place where we go where is that of course god is the mother also yeah the bible calls him the blessed one of the bible where we suck he's amen now i want i want us to look at parenting according to scripture remember this is supposed to be typed spiritually as i presented my aim is to show you the spiritual but i speak the physical typing the spiritual give me hebrews 12 11. i read about about you don't need to go there because i'm going to read about first scriptures very quickly hebrews 12 11 says now not just a name for the present simmons to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterwards it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness and to them which are exercised thereby yes oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] until you leave the service and say how could pastor speak to me like that oh he's a nuke fool my music is he the one supposed to tell me what to do oh yeah you know kum [Music] but the bible is telling us when you were testing bible yet when you are corrected it does not seem to be joyous say listen but it seems to be grievous amen this bible this word of god is this message of the hour is given to us to correct us [Music] hallelujah amen do you remember the road which moses went with to egypt [Music] these men you know seem to also try to to have a display of power because you never said that a display of authority you have all these troubles but more than showed them a higher display of authority and power yeah i already know a man you know we use the rich which he held even because that road was given him by god himself and he told him put it under your armpits [Music] and uh it was a road again a good damn now let me tell you when he threw it down and when he breaks it down good job that's process of throwing it down and picking it up he doubted it and his son died what happened don't doubt this message because this message is the highest revelation in the land now come on this is a lot of power but afterwards you could use the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby exercised i believe [Music] do you think we are doing [Music] what is the holy from faith to faith receive the holy ghost don't want amen and then he says in the book of proverbs 22 15. foolishness is the bowel in the heart of a child but the lord of corrections foolishness is bound in the heart of a child [Music] think they know what they are doing they are foolish by sinning according to what god says [Music] preaching on wednesday we are blessed hallelujah amen god is speaking to you now listen preacher amen foolishness is bound in the heart of [Music] you are a child of god [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] that life of jesus is squeezed out of you because that's who you are meant to be wrong i love my miniscules you can't leave them peacefully you lipstick don't be did you realize that and you realize [Music] okay [Music] foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but a lot of corruption shall drive it out from them far from them [Music] [Music] i don't know their group aren't they when someone some people are there and uh just about them they bring the roads [Music] some people say well that is just a means correction doesn't mean you beat them he shall not die [Music] you can amen amen without no correction from them if you beat them they will not die what are you talking about will continue echoing these words in your ears because this is the only road i can use i am also not using a right now hallelujah amen [Music] [Applause] amen and 6 4 and your fathers provoke not your children but bring them up in the nature and admonition of the lord it doesn't mean that there are some fathers who are very tough omani why do you ever tell them when you know every time but you can say that i am [Music] amen before you raise your voice at your child no matter the name of god set them down read the bible for them the word of god says never isn't this never ending do you know if you do this oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] is the only one who disturbs usually they disturb usually they grow in that atmosphere so when they become true they start reducing when they become three they stop disturbing me usually my children by age the moment you knew and you begin praying for him he will start right now you run around and then after a while when you are finishing but he knows when you're finishing uh [Applause] i remember elizabeth when she was still you know smaller she used to tell me and also this the other one if she was used to telling me daddy you know when i'm tired those days sometimes when you're tired and you feel oh no let me just rest i know that you don't have that you have not read is coming from a child [Music] [Music] because of the children but because of the irrelevant parents that had brought the children up that way now you respect god you know there is nothing in this world that lands so fast like children they learn so fast and they don't need to learn are you teaching them cut her hair back now cathy if you really want and they will make sure that their god is covered not even atmosphere hallelujah if they see you do that have you ever realized that when a father is an engineer the child wants to be an engineer when the father is a smoker the child wants to be small mechanically [Applause] you know there are men who could have these days women don't come over ah you know the women these days are very intelligent some years ago but nowadays let me tell you a man who runs away from their home is not is not worthy to be a man [Music] [Music] miracles because their parents told them to disrespect hallelujah two sheep bears come out and killed for the two of them can you imagine terrorism she bears will come and destroy your children [Music] [Music] talking to one another bro laughing at the preacher can go wrong what is wrong almost everybody wants the family family upon his laws and kills these children can't even behave themselves in the church i can't even respect the word of god [Music] i watched a video once on youtube god bless that preacher and there was a young man on the phone while the preacher's preaching so he was never understood the pleasure what is it and let me tell you god had mercy on that child he would have died one day brother was preaching organ [Music] [Music] and now and the next time they called by the banana right there said she's dying come and pray for your mom calling for you what you say but he said [Music] the parents of these children they always were there you know laughing around hahaha bald head you mean that bald edward no matter how much they didn't believe since song about it is a question they ought to have kept their mouth shut whatever it is stay away from it you find parents talking against speeches oh sangha they had to say something that they ought to not have said and what happened to them of course you know what happened to them shippers came out from the wire all of them died for the two children [Music] if you don't [Music] [Music] [Music] how was i inspired by this now i traveled in the northeast when i traveled there i found these children they didn't even really care about the message you know what's the message yes what what does it mean parents need to put an extra if not depend why he's going to tell you the vam is though i was my words those are the words of god maybe i could you will not depart from it look at yourself now where to look at each of you b [Music] choices in life including serving god i'm leaving for him they would be making choices on the right basis and atmosphere all right [Music] choices sorry i said we have a network problem but i think can you all hear me now wave your hands if you can yeah god bless you god bless you so now we are reading from the message god is provided away and the prophet says we cannot have a healing service here until people get in the spirit of healing we cannot have a feeling until people get [Music] when what about the atmosphere of the holy ghost and the glory of god is being preached and demonstrated enraged in my childhood and the power of all the gods setting forth an example the resurrected resurrection of jesus christ [Music] let us let me be in the atmosphere of the holy ghost [Music] living in [Music] let us go in the atmosphere of the foreign
