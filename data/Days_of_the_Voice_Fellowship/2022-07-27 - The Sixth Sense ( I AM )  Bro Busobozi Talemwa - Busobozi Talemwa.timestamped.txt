[26:22] [Music]
[26:56] [Music]
[27:02] m
[27:12] now this
[27:13] scripture is very common for for us
[27:18] you
[27:18] know shall we judge truly says jesus
[27:21] christ the same yesterday today and
[27:23] forever
[27:24] yes
[27:28] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[27:30] today and forever yes christo jones
[27:44] so this evening i'm speaking on the
[27:46] sixth sense get cents
[27:56] it's really a continuation
[27:59] and i'm speaking today on
[28:02] [Music]
[28:12] and
[28:14] let us read from verse one and we will
[28:16] read most of the chapter all of the
[28:18] chapters
[28:25] and i want you to be
[28:26] attentive tonight
[28:57] baby tara because you believe that
[28:59] faith is a substance
[29:10] through faith we understand that the
[29:12] words were framed by the word of god so
[29:14] that things which are seen we are not
[29:16] made of things which do appear
[29:24] on
[29:29] so whatever was made was not made out of
[29:31] the things that we see
[29:36] it was made of things which do not
[29:37] appear that you have
[29:41] offered unto god a more excellent
[29:43] sacrifice
[29:45] by which he obtained witness that he was
[29:47] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[29:49] and by it being dead yet speak it
[29:52] is
[30:18] not seen as yet moved with fear prepared
[30:21] an ark to the saving of his house by the
[30:24] which he come condemned the world and
[30:26] became
[30:27] here of the righteousness which is by
[30:29] faith
[30:52] notice that all these people
[30:55] were able to please god by faith
[31:01] please god by faith
[31:40] [Music]
[31:43] according to
[31:59] you you you prepare yourself according
[32:00] to the message you can go back
[32:02] that is faith
[32:05] like noah was saved in his entire fight
[32:11] by faith abraham when he was called to
[32:13] go out into a place which he should
[32:15] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[32:18] and he went out not knowing whether he
[32:20] went
[32:23] away
[32:26] again
[32:37] as in a strange country dwelling in
[32:39] tabernacles with eyes i can jack up the
[32:42] hairs with him of the same promise
[32:49] [Music]
[33:00] we looked for a city now i'll just read
[33:02] through brother before he looked for us
[33:04] listen
[33:05] for he looked for a city which had
[33:08] had foundations whose builder and
[33:11] america is gone through faith also sarah
[33:14] herself received strength to conceive
[33:17] seed and was delivered of a child when
[33:19] she was past age because she judged him
[33:22] faithful who had promised there are for
[33:24] sprang sprang there even of one and him
[33:28] as good as dead so many as the stars of
[33:31] the sky in the in the in multitude and
[33:34] as the sand which is by the sea show
[33:37] innumerable
[33:38] these all died in faith not having
[33:41] received the promises but having seen
[33:43] them afar off and we are persuaded of
[33:46] them and embraced them and confessed
[33:49] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[33:51] the earth for they that say such things
[33:54] declare plainly that they seek a country
[33:56] and truly if they had been mindful of
[33:59] that country where from whence they came
[34:01] out they might have
[34:03] had opportunity to have returned but
[34:06] now they desired a better country that
[34:08] is unheavenly hallelujah whereas for god
[34:12] is not ashamed
[34:13] to be called their god for he has
[34:15] prepared for them a city by faith
[34:18] abraham when he was tried offered up
[34:20] isaac and he had received the promises
[34:24] offered up
[34:25] his only begotten son of whom it was
[34:28] said that in isaac shall thy seed be
[34:30] called
[34:32] accounting that god was able to raise
[34:34] him up even from the dead from whence
[34:37] also he received him in a figure by
[34:40] faith isaac blessed jacob and essel
[34:43] concerning things to come by faith jacob
[34:46] when he was dying blessed both the sons
[34:48] of joseph and worship
[34:50] and jacob when he was dying blessed both
[34:53] the sons of joseph and worshipped
[34:55] leaning upon the tops of his staff by
[34:57] faith joseph when he died made mention
[35:00] of the
[35:01] departing of the children of israel and
[35:03] gave commandment concerning his bonds
[35:06] listen by faith moses when he was born
[35:09] was he three months of his parents
[35:11] because they saw he was a proper child
[35:15] and they were not afraid of the king's
[35:17] commandment by faith moses when he was
[35:19] come to years refused to be called the
[35:21] son of pharaoh's daughter choosing
[35:23] rather to suffer affliction with the
[35:25] people of god than to enjoy the
[35:27] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[35:30] the reproach of christ greater riches
[35:32] than the treasures in egypt
[35:35] for he had respect and through the
[35:37] recompense of the reward
[35:40] are you listening church
[35:42] by faith he forsook egypt not fearing
[35:45] the wrath of the king for he endured as
[35:47] seeing him who is invisible through
[35:50] faith he kept the passover and the
[35:52] sprinkling of blood lest he that
[35:54] destroyed the first born should touch
[35:56] them by
[35:57] faith they passed through the red sea as
[36:00] by dry land which the egyptians are
[36:03] saying
[36:04] to do were drawn
[36:06] by faith the words of jericho fell down
[36:09] after they were compassed about seven
[36:11] days by faith the hard rahab perished
[36:14] not with them that believed not when she
[36:16] had received the spies with peace
[36:18] and what shall i most say for the time
[36:20] would fail me to tell of gideon and of
[36:22] barrack and of samson and object
[36:25] jefferson of david also and samuel and
[36:28] all the prophets
[36:30] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[36:33] righteousness obtain promises stop the
[36:36] mouths of lions quest the violence of
[36:38] fire escape the edge of the sword out of
[36:42] weakness
[36:43] we're made strong
[36:45] what's variant in fight turn to flight
[36:49] the armies of the eye
[36:52] aliens women received their dead rays to
[36:56] life again
[36:57] and others were tortured not accepting
[36:59] deliverance they might obtain a better
[37:02] resurrection and others had tried of
[37:04] cruel mockings and stolens yeah moreover
[37:07] bones and imprisonment
[37:09] they were stoned they were sowed asunder
[37:12] we are tempted we are slain with swole
[37:14] they were they wandered about in
[37:18] sheep's skin and got skin being
[37:19] destitute africa tormented of whom the
[37:22] world was not worthy
[37:24] they wanted in deserts and in mountains
[37:26] and in dens and in caves of the earth
[37:29] and these all having obtained a good
[37:31] report through faith
[37:33] received not the promise god having
[37:36] provided some better thing for us that
[37:39] they without us should not be made
[37:41] perfect
[37:44] when you read this
[37:45] uh hebrews 11
[37:47] you know
[38:06] you know
[38:07] somewhere in the bible it says that i
[38:09] think it says in the book of hebrews it
[38:10] says that
[38:11] if joshua had given them rest what
[38:14] was this
[38:31] to mean that that
[38:33] rest that was remaining was the sabbath
[38:35] race
[38:42] because actually in the book in the
[38:44] category says for if jesus had given
[38:47] them rest
[38:51] then he wouldn't have talked of another
[38:52] day
[38:55] but you see there he was meaning joshua
[38:59] joshua did not give these people rest
[39:01] yes
[39:03] about you
[39:04] when moses brought them out of egypt
[39:06] mushrooms
[39:07] joshua took them into the promised land
[39:09] yesterday
[39:11] and they believed on god they were ready
[39:13] underwater they suffered the rest of
[39:15] their soul already just submitted
[39:18] after fighting for years and years
[39:22] after going to whatever we have gone
[39:23] through in the days and the three times
[39:25] of your neighbor to your same withdrawal
[39:26] we are going
[39:56] it's now rest from our works the works
[39:58] of sins
[40:02] and he came and he said come unto me
[40:03] already that labour and the heavy light
[40:05] and i'll give you rest
[40:08] about it
[40:21] we have read about here men and women of
[40:23] faith really spoke of him
[40:29] by faith they did what they did
[40:32] by faith he never obtained a promise
[40:36] but
[40:55] [Music]
[42:13] abraham believed in the resurrection
[42:18] even if i give my son god is able to
[42:20] raise him up again
[42:26] but yet god
[42:28] had never requested for child sacrifice
[42:33] god had never requested for human
[42:35] sacrifice
[42:38] you read your bible that's the only
[42:40] sacrifice god has never asked for my
[42:42] bible
[42:56] but because jesus christ died in your
[42:58] strength
[42:59] yes yes
[43:01] you're the only human that has ever died
[43:03] to your career as a sacrifice for sin
[43:05] that's a darker yes that we may be able
[43:07] to surrender ourselves
[43:11] [Music]
[43:21] [Music]
[43:24] our faith must be built on something
[43:30] and today in the service i will take one
[43:32] example here already
[43:39] another in chapter 11 of john masoli
[43:44] and i'd like you to look at it
[43:49] yes
[43:58] our faith must have a basis
[44:19] jesus christ the same yesterday
[44:21] and today and foreign
[44:58] [Music]
[45:11] [Music]
[45:19] [Music]
[46:26] he started
[46:39] you did not get yourself here by your
[46:41] own abilities
[46:45] you didn't even get yourself here
[46:46] because of somebody else
[46:50] it is because of him or your years
[46:52] because of christ it is
[47:07] [Applause]
[47:34] [Music]
[47:42] now a certain man was sick named lazarus
[47:45] of bethany the town of mary and her
[47:47] sister mother
[48:05] you remember this mary is the same woman
[48:08] that
[48:09] bowed to the feet of jesus and washed
[48:12] jesus's feet with her own tears
[48:29] i love it when jesus is not in
[48:30] connection with only me but with my
[48:33] family
[48:40] hey man then he has a more reason to
[48:42] come to your rescue
[48:44] song is
[48:49] look at verse 3 says it was that mary
[48:51] which anointed the lord with ointment
[48:54] and wiped his feet with her hair whose
[48:56] brother lazarus was sick
[49:29] therefore his sister sent unto him
[49:31] saying
[49:32] lord
[49:33] behold he whom thou lovest is sick
[49:38] now jesus was not only friends with mary
[49:42] and martha but was also a friend
[49:46] with lazarus
[49:56] and when they were sending for jesus
[49:59] listen
[50:00] uh friends of jesus
[50:03] we are telling jesus about his friends
[50:10] with
[50:13] [Music]
[50:24] [Music]
[50:25] [Applause]
[50:52] so the way they wrote the letter was
[50:54] anger when they come up with the lord
[51:00] whom thou love is too sick
[51:04] when jesus heard that he said
[51:11] [Applause]
[51:36] that he was sick he aborted two days
[51:38] still in the same place where he went
[51:41] up
[51:44] he think about it
[51:48] look at it this way should have been
[51:49] what tell us jesus loved luanga and his
[51:52] wives and his children yes
[51:59] they were in trouble
[52:02] he
[52:12] because they loved them
[52:22] [Music]
[52:49] [Music]
[52:58] he
[52:58] is trying to tell them i'll get that cup

[53:08] turn that banana you may not feel me but

[54:20] water signs of his love and approval
[54:36] oh
[55:16] which he had for us before the
[55:17] foundation of the world
[55:22] does he love us
[55:24] oh yes
[55:26] but how shall we know
[55:28] no because he said so
[55:36] and he manifested that he did love us
[55:39] for he brought us to himself and gave us
[55:42] of his spirit blessing us as sons
[56:03] he died on the
[56:06] messiah and he brought us to himself
[56:11] there is nothing that can prove his love
[56:13] more than that

[1:19:41] thy brother shall rise
[1:19:46] unto him
[1:20:01] but

[1:20:12] even now
[1:20:16] yeah i know he will rise in the
[1:20:17] resurrection
[1:20:20] she
[1:20:21] lacked faith she lacked a revelation yes

[1:20:33] you know
[1:20:35] we have all the sorts of promises god
