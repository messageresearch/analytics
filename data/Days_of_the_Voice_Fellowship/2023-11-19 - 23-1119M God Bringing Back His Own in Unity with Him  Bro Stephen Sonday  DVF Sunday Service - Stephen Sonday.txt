this place you have a reason why we are here we your children we know you have brought something for us we know you have something in store for us you have the food of Life you've brought [Music] the right rebuke you have brought to us because a parent chains their children may we be chained before you Lord that we may be of good as children of God both male and female forgive our my unrighteousness forgive the unight of your children every time your children as human beings we see Lord in M Lord of this Earth Lord but when we come to you the par you wash us with the water of your word and we go back when we are like you Lord father I am nothing I don't know anything I don't even know what speak but you have all things and you can do all things everyone here Lord you know them you know their issues you know what they need you know they come to seek for and may you give them that Lord you say come and heav and all those with needs that you will meet all of them Lord father meet each and everyone in a miraculous way I thank you a brother that you that day and he got his life I've also got another brother our friend also managed to bring him there will be a visitor in this place also here tonight may your presence be manifested in a I didn't intend to be here but you knew it that I will be in this service and I'm the one is going to Lord I was asking you what should I speak I don't have anything but Lord he said you have what Lord I welcome you this place Lord show your power Lord let your presence and everybody as they will leave this place they will say that for sure you glory Lord May the sick be healed May the dead be raised those who are feeling weak those debts be paid for wherever you met people they never remain the same even today Lord each one that they may not remain the same the glory will come and glory in the name of Jesus Christ we [Music] [Applause] pray the Lord bless you you may be [Music] seated I thank God for your P it is because this pit it is for the pastor he knows who to bring here and what he's going to give to the for he is the pastor he spoken small He Has Lifted Me So High I'm very down I never went to school I don't have education I don't know anything there is nothing that I glory in Praise Jesus even the tri where I was born they never even knew God even me I grew when I was UN righteous but by Grace he called me he called me as I was he called you the way you were you didn't do anything you cannot glory in anything for all of us here whether you went to school or you never went to school whether you know or you don't know anything when you die whether you have money whether you have a car whether you have a house whether you have a wife you don't go with anything you cannot glory in such things you can't glory in these there is nothing we can glory in but there is only one thing as Paul said he said that if I have to glory in this flesh no one is better than me I'm a Jew for the Jew is the nation which God Called to be called a Jew you are such a very wonderful person special person it was so great that God chose the Jews to become his nation and he said that I'm of a tri of Benjamin you know there are two tribes in Israel those are the most powerful tribes The Tribe of Benjamin and the tribe of [Music] Judah he would have glorified himself in being of the tribe of and he said in the law I am a he went to school in the col in the of he was trained he was Tau he was supposed to be a priest or a pope Bishop he was already in school for that but when he met Christ all those things became of no [Applause] gain for when he he he realized that knowing Christ is the most important thing it is not the education it's not the it is not the clothes the robes you know in the religious real they have Rob every rob it has its Glory every Rob has it own when one person one person can put on like five Rob or six and they put on a heart so when you look at them you really see there in heaven so Paul was higher than that praise our Lord but all that they never helped him praise our Lord that when I say this I want us to look at what is far beyond people have got honors people are really high they white when the whole earth look looks at them they tremble but when sickness comes sickness when sickness or the devil come when death comes yeah I think I think is death when death comes n of them stands before it died very many popes have died praise our Lord Buddha died died of them overcame death but there is one man it is Jesus Christ you don't have anything to Glory about I don't have anything to Glory even when I put on a glittering suit if I put on a one million wor suit you drive the most expensive car but they will never bury you with it and it will not stop you from dying but we have one man who is an overcomer the one who never went to school amen he did not have any qualification praise our Lord but when he met death he overcame death when he met the grave he overcame the grave when he reached in the grave in hell he overcame hell am now that man the one we should glory in if you don't have that man you are [Music] nothing that is why I was feeling so small before God and it is good each one of us to see yourself like that because he loves them that love him him mm- he loves who he loves amen he forgives them he wants to forgive you can't command him you cannot advise him he is infinite uh-uh dictator he's a dictator amen hallu even the educated one are collected praise our Lord now that man no one is like him what he decides nobody can stop it so for you to be here he has decided you to come he has decided that you come here the one he didn't want to be here he's not here for you are here for a purpose and he's the one who brought you and you don't have anything to say about it for you have already come [Applause] here our Lord when the pastor told me as you're coming this I want you to come and visit us and said is it the way God has shown it to you he said that is it you have to come if he is the Lord he wants me to come he will make me come I don't want to do what I want I want to do what he wants because even my coming the other time I didn't bring myself and I'm not the one who brought this brother when we finish the service the brother God has met me I've seen God didn't know that he was a visitor but that was his first time even me it was my first time to see but when you see the tesy you really see God had the purpose where he came from and he came in that service an evening service amen you see how God does things everything it happens as a purpose there is nothing nobody will go this side or the other side if God wants you to come in a certain place I T in church of Uganda for three years I loved God I was seeking for God I never went there to seek for a job I didn't go there to seek for Hors I went to seek God and when I reach there God wanted me to go there because God has ways through he takes through his children that they may know everything praise the Lord I spent those three years and God put me on another level and he helped me meet the Pentecost the way they came the way they came to me I I realized that the things which I knew when they were weed in the Bible I was found holding only feathers because the first question they asked me it was baptism they told me they baptized you they baptized you in the forehead where did you get that froment and when he had G to preach I looked for a scripture which says sprinkling I thought I had my Reverend for he's the one who sent me when I asked the reverend in the Bible is there imion what he told me that I told him there are people there are people who were asking me where did we get the sprinkling the re told me do what we told you show me a scripture when I meet them I'll give them proof he said I've told you one thing as we told you so do what you told if you want them go where they are but here we don't do what those men are telling you you see what would I have done sincerely there is no written evidence there is no evidence of sprinkling there was no evidence nobody has ever done it the God is Bible there are not two Bibles it is only one Bible God is one we are working for God all of us what is not in God's program now as a preacher why do you preach what is not in God's program now I found myself that the gospel I was preaching it was the Gospel of the church it was the Gospel of the Church of Uganda but it was not The Gospel according to the Bible now all you you know you see because whatever is written whatever we preach whatever we preach must come from the Bible praise our Lord if we are preaching the gospel we are not the begin the one who started the gospel the gospel was started by our Lord and it was held by the first believers and it was confirmed with Miracles and wonders and they took the gospel all over the world so Jesus said go around the world now when the gospel reached here as when it comes when it is changed how can we take what is changed we have to take the original and they made a mistake and they gave us a Bible when you go in confirmation they say buy a Bible that is why I say God bless those people for telling us to buy Bible they sh us Delight when you move in darkness it will they shown us the light if you move in darkness it is up to you for you have the testimony in your hands you have the kingdom in your hands may the Lord bless you I was just laying a foundation I was in Pentecostal for six years in those six years they lifted me and I became an overseer Overseer in P you are a bishop because you are an overseer you have churches which you oversee I was I was having three districts under me I was a bishop of three districts we ate goat we had go owners we enjoyed owners praise our Lord but when we met this message God took away all those honors praise our Lord and we remain with one honor of being a pastor when you're a pastor feel good for in the Bible pastors are there in the Bible if you're a teacher feel good because in the Bible teachers are there in the Bible if you are a preacher if EV because evangelist in the Bible if you an AP if an apost feel good for in the Bible Apostles are there your your honor is your glory it is there in the Bible but if you're a prophet still good as a prophet because you are there in the Bible but other glories and honors you were given to them by the devil because in the Bible they on titles there are titles which are put in the Bible there are not such titles amen Bishop in the Bible there is no Bishop in the Bible there is no father in the Bible there is no in the Bible there is no Arch Bishop in the Bible there is no in the Bible there is no Zone leer in the Bible there is no Pope so if they are not in the Bible they are not in the book of life now how can I be outside the Book of Life what am I doing there the Bible says in Revelation that books were open and the Book of Life was open and whoever who was not written was thrown into to the Lake of Fire now that title if God never gave it to you others are called Lords Lord if you don't call them Lord they don't feel good because he went to school to get that title but Jesus said you should never be called in the Bible it is there and it is Jesus who said that but then somebody takes it they have become Lord others are called [Laughter] brother because is the most Lord the most Lord that is that that title is for Satan is's the one who gives such he gives them to whoever he wants but but me I left all that brother Bram say if you love me call me brother Bram brother we are brothers we are brothers Jesus even Jesus is our brother say I call you my brothers are you a brother of Jesus amen amen if I am a brother of Jesus I feel better because we are one blood even here we are brothers praise our Lord we have Elders we have young ones we have siblings but we are all Brethren do you like that to be brothers when you have your elder brother your elder brother praise the Lord and the younger brother they all remain Brothers but there is a father the father of all of us that is the one who loved us and called us he wants us to be one in unity praise our Lord and for that cause I have not yet started my preaching I you know Pastor have a lot of words I don't know how I'm going to reduce these words the words are so many when you spend many years you see a lot of things when you go through many places you meet a lot of things now through the p through the Church of Uganda through the message there's a lot that have met and they want they now that so God teaches us through the lifestyle we go through Praise Jesus I know that every stage you reach it has a level a level of challenge for that when I left church of Uganda I I I accepted to be abused they abused me they said that it is the devil who took me because they put me in a committee they called the leaders of the government they called all the teachers of the religion and they wanted to spoil my name praise our Lord that I will not preach anymore and they said that you should even vacate this locality the bishop said I'll take you away from here praise our Lord but if you fight with God you cannot manage him when you close the door God will go through the the ventilator but still he will enter in he will take their children his children you can't close God's child in any prison amen the ones the devil had locked in the in in Hell Jesus went and removed them when Peter was locked in the prison and they were going to to kill him the other day Jesus came there nobody could enter there but Jesus went there the devil will never lock you anywhere there is no way the devil will ever lo you the Lord will bring you out there is no situation where the devil will lock you under the Lord will put you out if it is a job if there is it is lack of money if things are going wrong the Lord is [Music] seeing he will reach there you what belongs to you only believe that he is able praise our Lord the lion you know how the lion Ro all the religious people confirm and they said Daniel to take Daniel away that his gospel will stop and all his words to Cee [Music] and his church to be destroyed he has to be thrown into the Den of Lions yes they threw him in the den of lions but the Lions the god of Daniel God was in Daniel the Lions never ate Daniel praise our Lord God when God is in you whe they have thrown in the you will be a friend to those Lions because Lions you are the one who created them because you are a child of God those are God's animals our Lord now there is no situation where the devil can put you in that God will not bring [Applause] out I want you to put that in your heart that God knows youon praise our Lord Jonah disobeyed God but it was not him who disobeyed God wanted it that way to show his power and even to save the people of n if he went when he was in a boat praise the Lord the people wouldn't have believed him but God is very wise God has many ways if he wants to save somebody you can't stop God you can't put any hindrance praise our Lord Jonah they told him to go to n and then he went to T he just changed his thoughts let me go I know those people but God knew what he was going to do praise our Lord but Jonah those people they are not manageable for me to go and preach there let me go and preach this way let me go and preach inis praise our Lord so God said it's okay all is well praise the Lord the storms from God God raised a storm you know all that which happened until when everybody Cried unto the Lord but Jonah he knew that God was seeking for him within the whole Bo God was looking for Jonah praise our Lord when situations go bad turn to yourself and know that you are the cause God wants something I am the cause of all this trouble Jonah knew that he didn't even pray he knew that God is the one because he had disobeyed God and even why I'm going God doesn't want me to go there praise our Lord now Jonah kept quiet others repented they threw things into the ocean Jah Jah was not praying brother why are you not praying what are you doing here where are you coming from where are you going going Jonah spoke one thing I fear the lord I am running away from God you're running from God you want to bring trouble to us he said I am the cause of all this turmoil I am the cause of the problem in the church when you come here and not standing right do you know that you bring problems to the church you bring sickness to people you bring people to be poor and even bring problems said I am the cause he was a honest Christian he could recognize his mistake praise our Lord now what should we do for you J to save you throw me into the ocean let me die that you will be saved praise our Lord but don't die on my behalf praise the Lord a Believer accepts their mistakes praise our Lord they got hold of it is not accountable to us it is upon you Jonah said Let It Be accounted to said but your blood said that I'm the I'm the one in the wrong I am accountable you throw me into the water They Carried Jonah and threw him into the water praise our Lord when Jonah fell into the water there there is this weed on the water when he fell into the water the weed held his and he was like sailing on top of the water praise our Lord and then the fish said I can see food there praise our Lord it swallowed Jonah it swallowed him he was fighting with the wind fighting with the water now he got another one it swallowed him God allowed the fish to swallow Jonah the situation became so even more than how he was even more than when he was even when he was in the he got a bigger problem it took him in the stomach now see where Jonah is praise the Lord when he touches every side he is touching the stomach stomach intestines he was under things he doesn't understand when the fish got him it went in the depth of the ocean so where was Jonah now so the people were in the boat were wondering where is Jonah he was he was he was being healed by the by the we but now we don't see him now God he was still the god of Jonah he was still with Jonah he gave him oxygen to breathe he lived inside the inside the fish inside the fish under the waters knew you done Jonah but God he was still having a plan with Jonah brother brother when situations become harder God is still around God is still seeing God is still able don't say this situation is beyond no sir situation was beyond and over it was rot and Beyond one day two days until the third day praise our Lord Jonah remembered God he remembered the scriptures he remembered what Solomon said when he was dedicating the temple said Lord you said that whatsoever situation a person will be found if they if they remember praise the Lord face his eyes to Jerusalem where your name dwells and calls upon you the situation will seiz at that time he did not see the symptoms which inside the B of f the situation was he saw himself in the temple praising the Lord thanking God he forgot he forgot the situation in the he was in another sense of Faith now I'm an overcomer because faith it is what was present he saw that he was in the temple he saw he was no longer in the problem he was no longer in the stomach of the and he saw himself in Jerusalem because he believed that God spoke and God wherever God is that is where his children ah amen so he went in the situation of the fish and he went into the water and he saw the promise the promise brought him out by faith and he saw that he was in the temple he saw he was no longer in the situation praise the Lord when he started that God was said that is what I was wanting to see me more than the situation you are in so he said now you are victim praise our Lord the fish ever since it swallowed it was not stable because everything it eat Jonah was still living in the fish he was not dead I said I ate I

people they were worshiping a God that was their God they were worshiping so God he wanted to take to them their God so that they see the power of their God praise the Lord they were there they saw a fish not this fish we eat that one cannot it was like a well so big Wells we call them Wells I don't know how long it is and how big when everybody saw the fish they saw water moving around there they could see it in pictures but God had came in reality so they told the whole city come and see our fish God has come come and see we have been seeing him in in in images and pictures but now he's leaving sisters if you were there you would also run to see the god fish praise our Lord when the fish reached all the people gathered to see so it opened its mouth and it the door was open and a man Jonah came out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah I want to tell you the Living God the god fish the one you worship the god me have come here to show you the Living God the Living

dress yourselves Andress yourselves and put on suoth and we cry unto God that is the Living God when Jonah finished preaching the fish had left he got somewhere and sat down he sat down and wait for 40 days for the people of n to perish but God has a way he wanted the people to repent did they repent yes yes they repented did he forgive them he forgave them today there is one greater than Jonah that is our Lord Jesus amen he died heame the what ever that was binding all the Devils that were binding he overcame them he overcame death he overcame the grave he overcame hell he's here to make everyone an overcomer amen oh Hallelujah I have not yet preached praise our Lord but have you been have you got something now that Foundation don't leave that Foundation God has a plan which you even don't know he has Mighty things which you don't even know and he has prepared them for you and you're not going to die before you reach the [Applause] things don't lose hope when I got things were bad Jonah things were also bad but after some time things became better every day things will go wrong but after the bad things good things happen let us stand on our fet and we read the word Heaven and Earth Shall Perish but God's word will never perish GRE all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm that is the church I was given Grace to believe this message even you tonight you have given God grace to welcome this message because this is our life John 17 The Gospel according to John 17 [Music] verse1 John 171 we're going to read but I have lugana in English amen can can I read in English [Music] lug [Music] this words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee and as thou Hast given him power over all the flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him [Music] [Music] mhm amen and this is the life eternal that they might know the only Lord God the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou Hast sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do [Music] and now oh Father glorify thou me with the with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world th thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy Word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou Hast given me are of thee for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou Hast given me for the are mm now let us read John 12 and vers 30 joh 12 to 32 [Music] [Music] Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of the of this world be cast out and and I if I be lifted up from the earth will I draw all men unto me may the Lord bless his word all of you may be seated these words are so important the man we have been talking about now he has spoken for himself the main issue why the work he was sent for to do it was finished for the work we had brought it was to declare and two people God the word for the word it had been separated from the people people had separated themselves from God praise our Lord what we are going to learn today God reuniting with his people to work with men praise the Lord this Unity yes God had the unity God bringing back his own into Unity with him praise the Lord God once God had Unity with men but men broke that Unity but to restore rest that to restore that Unity God had to find a way God had to find a way of bringing back man into that Unity again it was important for God to first come to come down because man had fell from his glory and he fell down falling means something was up and then it fell down something cannot be down and then you say it has fallen something must fall from somewhere and then it falls down we know that God is above all situations even us when he created us he created us in him we are above are above our lives are above more than all things praise our Lord now we were in the mind of God even before the foundations of The World God we were with God and we were in him praise our Lord and we are in his word now time came and God spoke us and a word is a thought manifested amen when a word is spoken it shows what is in the mind because what is in your mind is what you speak amen now God he said let us create man in our own image and in our own likeness praise the Lord now man is a part of God's thought if man is a part of God when he was spoken and he became a part of his word praise the Lord uh I was telling something to the pastor's wife and she laughed I told her I was telling to the that we are the one who made the wedding of your mother praise the Lord when Pastor was introducing that is the pastor who preached to me and I said I preached to your dad when you were still inside him praise the Lord when your dad accepted the message you were also in Him Praise the Lord and on their wedding day I was with the Madame when she was still young I was with the mother of the pastor's wife even yes before the pastor's wife was born the wedding of the the mother of our pastor we are the people who made that wedding even before she was born before she was born praise our Lord and then she was born she grew up she became T's wife praise the Lord now today we see children they have given birth to the children were in now they are being seen because they in the thoughts of was in the thoughts of but had never seen her because when something is in your mind you would want to see it praise the Lord each one of us you have something you love when I grow up I will marry such and such you feel the woman in your mind or a black one or a skinny one or a tall one it is in your mind now when the man grows look for that which is in his mind praise the Lord when the person finds that he will give it a try with word is my thought if is this thought the one I'm looking Madame Madame do you believe do you accept to be my wife testing the thought when the woman says am now it is like [Music] now become a word the word brought the wife's wife was first in the thought now she became the word he spoke it now when the woman accepts it when the woman accepts it the woman becomes T's word when she believes that word that word lifts her and brings her into's family Hallelujah am now see the word the word starts to give birth it gives children praise the Lord even God he wants family he wanted a family be with but the family was in his mind he wanted to speak it that it will be manifested and then he sits with it and then he feeds with it that it may look like him praise the Lord Lord I've used the example of my son now the children you see before you married you had them but you didn't have fellowship with them but to to the desire to have the children in the physical real they had to get a wife to see to in order to see his children praise the Lord that is why God he took confidence in Adam as the image of God as the likeness of God he knew that Adam will give birth children that will look like him because Adam was looking like God and even Adam he had to give birth children who look like praise the Lord now saw man he said this man it is not good for for these years for the years as God have spent God spent those years alone he was living by himself but he had a lot of attributes he was not seeing so God wanted the things which were in his plan to be manifested and even his children to be manifested now in his children that were in his thoughts to see them so he sent his word because the word is what gives us to God his children God is says that every seed must bring forth of its kind the dog gives birth to a dog a cow give to a cow after creating all things he gave them a Lo but every kind will produce of its in Genesis 1 that is God's La everything brings forth of his and even God he must give birth of his kind now let us create man Genesis 126 he was creating a man in God's image [Music] Genesis 2:7 he was manifesting the flesh he made the FLH but I'm lost Pastor I yourdon when God created man the word create it means to speak and then something happens speak and exist so God said let us create man God created man in His image and in his likeness now that man he was not created that man was not made but he was created amen The Man was created now God created a man and then he made another man for the one who was created uhuh made he made he made a man for the other one who was created amen have you got it Genesis 2 that was the creation of the flesh genesis6 creation of the spiritual man now the man and the flesh they are not the same praise the Lord the man and this and the flesh are different man who was created and man who was molded they are different that's right you get it now the man a man is not made a woman and a man they make a body but they don't create the person that's right it is God who creates the person parents make the body mean that is why God says he doesn't see in the house built by men that is why man man was not worthy to be given back man was not supposed to be given birth from a union of a man and a woman you see that Adam was supposed to speak the word and then a child would be created that child would be created but not made yes that is why the devil he has no authority to create because he can't speak something into existence but he uses the instrumentality of God so he used the serpent to get a child through the woman so that he will also get a person they he works with praise the Lord but God when man fell God no longer sits in the man who was who was made by a man and a woman that is why God brought the second birth when somebody is not bornn again they will never inherit the kingdom of God because what is born of the flesh it is flesh the devil can use that in any way he want but whatever is born of God he does not sin have you seen the difference now our Glory Glory we glory in the flesh but the truth we should not glory in this flesh we supposed to glory in the in the New [Applause] Birth because Adam's Family which was supposed to be burned by the word he used the flesh and then he followed the law of the devil that the serpent had flesh amen now after the fall Eve fell from the word and then she remained can now the Flesh of The Serpent and of Eve you know when somebody moves out of the spirit what remains is to use the flesh the serpent told her God lied to you the day you will eat your eyes will open and you will be like God you will begin creating many people giving birth they think they are Gods because they give birth I am the one who created you I gave birth to you that is the devil because man cannot create it is only God who creates it is God who creates from today if somebody was not created by God they will never inherit the kingdom of God whatever is born of the flesh remains flesh and whatever is born of the spirit it is Spirit now if somebody does not have the spirit of God they have no difference with animals because what separates us it is God in us if God is not in you if God is not in me I can do whatever I want you see that now this message it brings back what brought Jesus because God when God saw Adam defeated Adam's Family fell it fell from the glory it fell from God's glory and fell down and the devil took it over and went with it now devil the same way the devil fell from heaven and he also made man to fall from God and man fell down now man and the devil they were on the same foot now he rules them what rules man is the devil because the devil fell first so and he made the man so he's going to rule the man he rules the man under the falling nature the one who fell the one who fell rules the one he made to fall you see now we are ruled by someone who when we are in this flesh and we obey the flesh we are under the rulership of the one who fell but we have a man God brought another man hallelujah [Music] amen Jesus brought a parable and he said that a mighty strong man when he ties somebody and he puts them down and another mightier person comes am amen this one was powerful he tied up this one and he made him sit down and now another more powerful person Comes Who is more powerful than the one who tied the other one and also get hold of him and put him down and he gets the one he deliv who is [Music] mighty now we and Satan who is more powerful have you got it if you understand it the devil was once powerful over me he was once powerful over you because he got old of you and he made you fall and he brought you from God and he tied you down under his prison but God he came with another man amen the most powerful man than the on who have tied you like you see Rebels rebels can come and capture someone as they ad mistreating you there the government sends the Army and the Army finds you tied up and then the Army will capture the they tie them up will they leave you tied you now the one who was bound will the oh now the rebel will be the one who will remain tied up yes you will stand why were you tying me they have got you now hallelujah amen you have to get the dev and do him like because we have a man Jesus Christ who overcame him and he put him down and he tied him and he tied him and he delivered you he took away the keys hallelujah amen whatever had put you in in his prison he he Jesus has the keys sir the devil had the keys and he was all God's children who would come he would lock them up he would lock them somewhere All God's Children he would lock be there David lock thereon think you have God be there hallelujah hallelujah and then he said Son of Man when he will be lifted from down he will bring all and bring them back to him praise the Lord he he came down he came down first from glory and became man he was born like a child he cried like a child he knew that the devil he entered and into two men the devil used all his means and he entered into the human race through the serpent but our Lord when he came in the world because he was God God used the word [Music] hallelujah amen used the word and the devil used the flesh he entered in flesh but God he used the spirit and entered into and was born Spirit he was not born in flesh the devil brought the sexual Union but our Lord his birth it was not from a sexual Union between a man and a woman because that it was the falling that is where we fell from the way which you would have taken that we would not be tempted we fell into the we came through [Music] Temptation the way we we part the falling nature from Adam all who are born by the woman they are born under the Fallen nature because we were not supposed to be born by women we are born by the word not bisexual Union when I say that there are some wise people who were by science and they thought is only the sexual Union which is there but let me show you from to that birth and existence birth and existence is not of one nature show me show me the parents of Adam the mother and the father of Adam was didam exist was he a man did he exist was was he existing from a father and a mother no if did he did she exist was she given birth to a man and a woman Eve was born by a man because God when he created man he created a man and woman so that the man will be the one to give birth because he's the one with the [Music] seed praise our Lord Brother Su brother SU men are very careful they are very very very caring praise the Lord now you're talking about how God came was born was not born by man and woman now what we saying the man had to give birth because he's the one with the seed God is the one to give birth because God is a seed a woman is a Garden a woman is the church but the seat is from the man now did not have where to his seed am himself he became a woman and he became a man yeah M that is right praise the Lord because God give him time to be with that woman the woman was in the man's wife was and that was his daughter and it was his wife praise the Lord now when the he had nowhere to give birth from so they operated him they operated amen when they operated Adam God brought the child out and brought the child to and now because first sleep when they going to you they give you chlorop and you sleep a deep sleep when you come back you come back knowing that I went to give birth you come back looking for the baby I went on that bed the reason why I was almost I was to give birth now I want my child this is my child now even Adam God took him to the bed and operated him and removed the wife and removed the baby when the baby came out he brought himam said nobody else this one is born of my B and his flesh from my flesh she will be called the woman because she was taken from [Applause] me now 's mother who is 's Mother and 's Father who is 's Father it is Adam you believe that hallelujah hallelujah that was very brand new God is very wise sence when in science when they operating the operating science started with God these men are just copying they copying what so she became a wife but before she became a wife she had to reach the state of the perfect to be a child and then grow up growing up to reach the St of giving birth to get a child and give birth you see that lived Like a Virgin girl waiting for what God say God said don't touch Adam did not even know what a woman is it was a mystery both of them had a mystery they didn't know Hallelujah God said give birth and replenish the Earth he spoke that when they were not in flesh he spoke to the spirit man so they were supposed to give birth in the spirit not in the flesh now to be the spiritual birth it is just a spoken word Mary gave birth to a child by the Holy Spirit the woman to give birth without a man there was no Union ever since the Earth ever it had never happened but God said that it will happen because when man fa God promised that the seed of a woman will will bruise the seed of a woman will bruise all these things I'm sneezing they came but we went past that those are Satan's lives we are more than conquerors praise our Lord now that is why Jesus is a very special that is why the birth of Jesus was so special because Jesus is spiritual he was born by the Spirit by the word which was spoken because man was spoken by the spirit and the word let us make man in our own image and in our own likeness is the word likeness it is the likeness of God in the beginning the spirit of God was Hing upon the waters when the whole earth was full of but when the spirit spoke amen the light came forth only the word cannot work without the spirit even the spirit cannot work alone without the word that is why man man must be born again to be given birth by the word to the nature of the word the Spirit come into that man of the word am amen are you let us go further I don't want to make you tired praise the Lord now man man is inded to come back to his or image you see that now when man fell the image and likeness of God it was it it was removed and we became in the image of the serpent this flesh it is not what looks like God this flesh is not what God created the other one was created and your was born from a man and a woman the other one was just created you see that now we want to go back into the Flesh of the third dimension this flesh [Music] that it is your original flesh but instead of coming within that flesh that devil when to Adam and they fell that flesh went back the the so we were born into the flesh not into the other spiritual Word Flesh the you get it now this flesh it is tempted but the other one it can't even do that now that flesh it is the original you if you were in the mind of God you were just get gotten copy and one copy remained here and then the original remained in heaven Hallelujah now what you see is a duplicate it is the duplicate which the devil uses but when the original comes it will no longer sin anymore praise the Lord that is why this flesh it is tempted because it was born in in in in in in last the Bible says in John chapter 1 the he said whoever is born of God does not sin he doesn't the one who is born of God it is the word you are the one the one who was with God Jesus prayed the prayer said father the children you gave to me they were yours and then you gave them to me and yours are mine and mine are yours praise the Lord I I've given them the word if you were God's child who was in eternity when you hear the word you hear yourself you hear your name say that is me that is now the other you there God creates them in the you here every word you hear it creates every word you hear it creates the other you there in you here in this body hallelujah amen hallelujah because you you are a word you were with God you in God's mind and you fell the one who was in The Go image of God went back now God made a person who looks exactly like you that is Jesus Christ you Jesus is you when you believe Jesus and he enters into you are the real Jesus who was here you can't backslide because you fa you fa but the you was not around but God got all of us hallelujah amen and he gave us a new man to come and give birth to us hallelujah [Applause] amen the one who were not born by the flesh and blood but born by [Applause] God and God he became man when he became man he becomes you because when Jesus comes in you that is the real image Jesus is the image of God that is invisible because when we fell we didn't know the image of God we look like nobody looks like God see Yow people black people is God black is God Brown is a white man or what praise the Lord God really so we are not looking like him everybody looks what they want I want to turn to your neighbor look at your neighbor and see whether they resemble you they don't resemble everybody resembles every sing which one of you resembles God praise the Lord but God he made another man in the word to be the image of the god to be manifested in flesh we when we believe him he sits in us and we become him and he becomes us hallelujah father the work you have given which defeated Adam have done [Applause] it glorify your name praise the Lord because they were in the world have taken them out of the [Music] world brother you are very high with Jesus in Heavenly places we are no longer L people we no longer bound down hallelujah [Applause] amen Bo if you put yourself down it is up to said that after I'm lifted up before he is lifted he came down and he was like us Philippians chapter 2 he was human like us and he said now I no longer call you slaves now you are my brothers me and you we are one the prayer I pray you to be in me and me to be in you that we should be one one one Hallelujah and if you love each other the whole earth will know that you are my disciples I have quotes I would read here but what I'm speaking they are not different from the message I different Pastor if I read it will take a lot of time but I'm speaking what I know praise the Lord now our brother the one who was able to be accepted because In Heaven There was a conference in Revelations chapter 5 and the conference asked they asked who is is worthy to go and get the Redemption book and read the names thereof praise the Lord and redeem them because the devil had taken them the duplicate he took them but you only have orinal original is in his hands Hallelujah who will be able to go and bring their name and call their names that they will be born of God that they will resemble God that they will be like God they get back the authority which they had before when they look into the human race there was none Worthy help me I lied you said said you have your the Heart Like The Heart Of God me I committed adultery I killed somebody's wife I am not worthy everybody from Adam up to the last person nobody nobody could go and remove the names the ones lost to speak oh the one Adam failed to speak to be created as God's children so Adam gave birth to us in the flesh now the flesh has to die but children are supposed to be born in the spirit and born in the with the word now who will bring the word John looked on he got an opportunity and was he looked at the angels to help Ang said we can't do that we don't know that we don't even have any Union with Humanity because we we are not like angels they are not female angels praise the Lord who will redeem women and men and angels the angel said concerning that they looked in no no one under the Earth there was no one John cried oh we are done we are because no one is worthy to redeem us the human r no one will redeem it they are to perish praise the Lord as he was there weeping and a voice came and say John weep not John weep not there is one the lion of the tri of Judah Hallelujah who is worthy he overcame he has the book he can get the book he has not sin he was born by the spirit he was born by the word is able to go to God he's worthy to go to God and get the book and call our Nam hallelujah [Applause] amen because her name were written even before the foundations of the world and our names were written even our names were written even before Lucifer s in heaven Jesus God knew that the devil will deceive God knew that the devil will deceive will deceive God children they will be deceived but he also knew who are those that will not be deceived and he wrote our names blood of the Lamb that was called the one was killed before the foundations of the world your name if you were in the mind of God your name was written it ink was the blood of [Applause] Jesus speaks it well and he says blessed are those of whom the Lord counts no sin blessed are those of whom God does not impute sin praise the Lord because Nam written by the when the devil bring and put it there the blood would wash it away I want you to know that t if you have got it it is like this knew that the devil is going to all the human race created by God but God he had his people his children the one he knew he knew them even before they were manifested knew that though they will be manifested in the flesh they will overcome Hallelujah it is in Romans chter 8 and ver 28 those those he let us read Romans eight you are notary are Ordinary People and there others who are extraordinary don't count yourself to be an ordinary person don't count yourself people who are of low value you are of much value Hallelujah you are more than the blood of God these people are wondering how can you be more than the blood of God if I have four Millions here and I getc yes and I get motorcycle and I want that Jud that motorcycle will be worth more than the 4 million I get my 4 million and I give them away that I get now God gave the blood and it was poured to get you and [Applause] me now what is more precious and value is it not you hu if you want a woman even if you have 10 cows and you say our daughter we want 10

Satan is modernization hallelujah hallelujah be in your nature God wanted you to be a woman stay a woman don't admire to be a man be in your position your lips are very special and valuable God desired to give you the devil lies to you you put red lips green lips black lips those are demons to change you from the image of God to take you from what God wanted you to be to make you what you

tall if you are huge that is how God wanted you to don't make yourself what you are not whenever you do what you are not that will be the devil you are leaving your position if anybody leaves their position they will have to die God told the fish stay in the water get the fish out of water and see whether it will live it would have left its word me I'm going to live in water like fish if you go there you will come out a dead person he told the bir the word told the bir fly in the air they fly in the air because the word told them to fly now you go and fly and we see you will fly fall and die praise the Lord when everything leaves the word it dies look at the oranges they were changed today oranges cannot give birth to us oranges today have no seeds the new oranges hybrid oranges when you plant it it can't even spend three years to dry now anything the devil has the devil sence the devil has entered into science sence science is now wisdom but what science does most of what science does the devil uses Satan to di to pervert the original to make it Satanic eggs the hand lays egg but today they are manufactured eggs you think those eggs bring life it is death praise the Lord that means we are in Satan all theity you see all the the discoveries you're seeing most of them they are of the devil because he brought all those discoveries the one who brought discoveries the son of K the the generation of K they are the ones which brought this science and but God's children the one who brought worship worship started with SE praise the Lord now works on the spiritual matters but on the wisdom now wisdom is fighting with faith the devil wants face to be washed away hallelujah amen let me show you something [Music] here I think written Romans Romans it shows that you were known he knew you those knew before they came into existence they the ones he chose the ones he chose then he justified them the ones he justified he glorified now if he loves you he calls you the ones he called they are the ones he has authority to justify praise the Lord hallelujah amen now what I want to say what shows that we fail I want to show you that everything which God created he created it perfect but when time came when man fell praise the Lord when man fell he became naked there was nothing God created which was naked look at the goats the goats have their clothes the God's cloth it is born with it it dies with it P Cuts they don't wash they don't wash it's clothes does not wear out all the time it looks good it doesn't have oil it doesn't have anything but God created it with that garment is see that the dog all of them they have their garments but people every Friday they want to go and buy clothes if I ask you how many clothes you have bought so far you don't even know them it means that you fail praise the Lord that is why every Saturday you will be buying new n but cows ever since it got its shoe even today the same shoe [Applause] gos everything it owns they don't wear because they are still in God's will they never fail that is why Jesus he came to clothe us because when man fell the devil told him you are now ashamed okay get some leaves put some leaves he covered himself with but as you know God is right when God came the leaves dried up why you running God I don't have clothes I'm naked what else from God that it was naked because the devil had undressed the woman when he undressed her even the woman undressed the husband they were naked now so what God had given them they were no longer seeing it the dog does not commit adultery gods don't commit adultery because it is human beings who commit adultery and fornication that is why goats goats cannot rap CS kids but people two years 20 old get with five children they are more animals than real animals now what shows that many animals which are male they cannot meet together but human beings they want a law to allow him marry fellow man think about until When God says I regret I ever made man was that man still in the image of God a woman was made for one man but today a woman a woman can be married to like five to six men men can marry more than one woman and women get married more than praise the Lord but God he made one man and give them one woman praise the Lord now see the mistake all the mistakes we see they show the we as the church we want a generation that fears the Lord women that fear the lord our children who fear God praise the Lord invisible and when you go in the message the invisible Union of the bride and Heaven bridegroom yes the Earth bride and Heaven bridegroom uhuh H the prophet talks about the major things which were given to a woman there are three major important things given to women praise the Lord number one a woman was not made like other animals she was created in her nature she has a door in the nature of women women have a door animals don't have virginity but human beings why did God do it that way she was given that to protect herself to keep that virtue of virginity praise the Lord secondly the the womb which gives birth she's supposed to keep it they put a door here inside there is a w the W of a woman it is supposed to to bring forth children the womb is supposed for woman to use it to bring forth children for the husband praise the Lord the third thing the the body of the woman there is a way God molded the woman's body all the things God put on a Woman They for only the husband not any other person amen the stomach the thighs every Beauty on a woman it is for her husband no one has a right to touch on a woman's body she's grown she's natured to wait for only her husband praise the Lord there is one thing which God is against the woman that will not there is one thing which a woman will never be jied from to lose her virginity a man who is not there husband God will not justify a woman who lost her virginity because that is so bad that is what the serpent did the woman is the one who brought polygamy because she was known by Two Men And even the first woman man was not the husband because God put that door to be a convenant every convenant has [Music] blood if somebody is sleeping please wake up very important to our children and most our female children listen very carefully and the responsibility goes to the parents to train your child never to fornicate that is so bad if you were married and you didn't tell your husband the truth repent your husband that cause can make you that cause can make the husband chase you to go back to your home to divorce you yes that cause can cause you to be divorced by your husband whether it has been 10 years or you have how many children you were in in a in a false marriage in a false relationship because you didn't tell your husband the truth but if you tell your husband and he forgives you it has no problem but if you lie to him praise the Lord on the day of judgment they will ask you that praise the Lord this is what I'm saying if made a mistake and a very bad mistake because blood every Union between with a virgin woman there is blood that blood it is the Covenant you become one blood your blood your blood will have joint will have joint will have joint God says what he has joined no man should put a s that is why that blood it is what joins you even as the blood the blood of Jesus it is what joins us that is a very crucial [Music] matter CHR Christ wants virgin women Christ is not going to marry a prostitute hey now our marriages is a a picture of Christ and the church today our marriage in religion religions married this woman Christ no today religion has married Christ's wife that is why the church the church is Christ's wife but today they have joined the church with with with priests they make you lie on the ppit and they put you there and they make you swear from there they you put on from today you are joined with the with the church what will Christ remain that is why they don't marry because their wife is the church their husband is the church they don't marry because their wife is the church is the church praise the Lord now what will Christ marry when we are joined with Christ we become his wife when we are joined with religion we become prostitutes we are in we are defiled because Jesus talked about the Virgin there are 10 virgins why did he use that word of virgins because a Virgin It is a pure woman so when we are born of the world we become virgins again in the spiritual realm we are no longer children or wives of the prostitute of the harot har yes he I can't even see I've made you praise the Lord what I am meaning we need to put things back into their position because things went astray the devil made things to go astray he took things from their position that is why God he starts from family where no young man no man is allowed to marry a woman who is not a Believer right or likewise no girl is allowed to be married to a man who is not a Believer whether they have money whether they are rich it is impossible under no circum before God that is a sin because that is what brought in Noah's days the world to because God is children instead of marrying God's very children they left God's children and they made into marriage they joined kan's blood with s's children it made God angry and he said from forth I will no longer wrestle with men and then he took away his Spirit from them that is very bad you will first back and then you go in the world bring girl and bring her to church I tell you never do that brother may do it and God will never forgive you or you sister you see the man here are poor you want some rich man who is in their religion there say that one will will take care of I tell you you would have sold your life there is no any place that allows you you and there is no place anywhere where you allowed to join with kind seed the religions you see they are kind children when you marry or get married to them or when they marry you they want to make you they want to make you what they are amen amen Solomon died he died when he had back because of women every woman he would bring he would come with their Spirit evil spirit you knowel for Maring from the world he married Jezebel because she was beautiful he married B's daughter yes the father was a priest of B The Woman married was a priestess to in B's Temple you know what that woman did to Israel now God from that time from the times of Noah he got angry and he removed his Spirit when we do that we make God angry how can the light join up with Darkness what portion does a Believer has with an unbeliever men here we want a generation which fears God a generation that is going to meet Jesus hallelujah hallelujah any woman when you when you fall with any woman you would have done exactly what the serpent did you have you have defiled somebody's wife can you imagine's wife the the serpent defiled somebody so even you when you def you define people's children you see what kind of judgment is that those are demons you have to keep yourself you keep your virginity as a young man you've get a wife a woman who has has also kept herself virgin that is why in the world there are very many bastard bastards in the world those ones they can never get saved you look at those kind of people people who want who love everywhere every living s those kind of people they don't get get saved let me say this that is there is a tribe in Uganda they say when you have one woman you may give birth to stupid children only in that Tri This Woman This Woman here you will get a blessed child clever child blessing don't come from women blessing don't come from blessing come from God those are demons those people don't get saved because they they have a lot of there are very many bastards and they were born by bad people and they love the devil so much Lord there are some families who kept their daughters from getting pregnant if you get pregnant if a child would get pregnant before marri they would take that girl near a river where there would be a cliff and they will push them there to die so that other people will fear that that is not supposed to be done but there are people who don't care let children play let grandchildren come kind of things they bring God's Wrath oh God in the Old Testament those kind of children were not forgiven up to the fourth generation those people could not even go to Fellowship until the fourth generation but today they have some chance because of the blood of Jesus Christ can forgive you hallelujah amen amen if somebody was fearing you are not the one who brought the condemnation it was your parents who did that but you were born you are free you are not condemned Jesus said come unto me let the little children come that is why we pray for children a child who is who has no connation for the blood of Jesus that is where they enter but it is hard for such to get it is God's grace alone because the blood sin moves through blood if you were from a family over fight so much with that demon because it is following you if you don't get the blood of Jesus you will be even when you get saved you remain for it is not our family Bloodlines they come looking for you but the blood of Jesus if you enter into that blood enter deep deep enter deep but demons they will look for you through the blood the blood people with anger people who have anger they get it from somewhere even ask them and they can't speak what is it those are demons which are following the Bible says don't be with such kind of anger anger came from kind and killed the brother all anger does not bring anything good don't speak anything out of anger because anger does not speak the truth does not speak the truth yes praise the Lord there's one more thing what the prophet says in the message enticing spirit Spirit which entice he says sin the biggest baddest sin it is lying right because lying we were created we were not created to be Liars praise the lord we were created we are truth because God is truth and lies are of the devil lies Li Started With the Devil lied to praise the Lord said God said but the devil the Ser said God lied to you God is truth he made it a lie when God asked Eve what have you done the serpent beged me prophet in that message it says that deception to be a liar you rather be with a drunkard to be with to stay with a li to stay with a liar you rather stay with another type of rather than a liar because lying hypocrite hypocrisy praise the Lord Jesus said in John 8 44 said you are of your father they said was glad to see my day our father said if you you would have loved me but have your the author of the liar [Applause] Satan [Music] mes moves on lies the churches you see many of them they use lies the wealth you see it moves with lies during the times of Jesus Jesus said the truth asked him is truth because the whole world is lied to when somebody lies they said this is our life to go and get a job you have to lie to get money from the bank you lie you want to go outside the devil wants you to lie have you heard that and Li of theil the devil has a lot of businesses he works a lot and he has market and he has customers says even today in church those Spirits are there demons they have a liar a part of their life becomes lies if they don't lie they don't feel okay how much you buy this i b such and such you Li you know when you tell them the truth they you may not get profit the devil wants you to use [Music] lies corruption all those things are of the devil when you speak the truth you might lose the joke because you have not done what you want now water is poured let everybody start checking up let me tell you somebody called Daniel Cur in the message called straight is the gate he was a mighty preacher he brought many people to Christ very many people had got saved he knew that what he was doing was right everything was doing he really saw God was using him praise the Lord but the day came he got sick he felt he was people were there the sing this the preach but he was sleeping in some small time and then he went behind the c beyond the curtain when he reached there he reached the gate said I've come who are you I'm what I am a might preacher I've finished my work on Earth I've come come to get my crown okay come in he entered let us see your name in this [Music] book was nowhere to be seen you are not here I am a mighty preacher are you people I brought many people to Christ I am one of the Heavenly families I am famous brother you not here now what do I do you have one chance you may go to the appeal to the high go to the white throne and appeal yes go to the you ask whether because we are not seeing you here how comes they sh the way to go to the when he started moving there was like some dim Darkness the light became BEC the light become much became much the more the light became the light became much and much and much like 100 times as the the sun he had a voice who is coming I am evangelist brought many people to Christ now my time is over in the world have come here to get my crown but have told me my name is not there now what are you saying they have said that I can come to the high court white Throne judgment let me ask you when you were in the world did you ever lie he was like a Miller looking ins inside of him wherever there was a scene there was a dark spot this and he said I was a liar are you Faithful [Music] there do it he was not faithful I was not faithful what was the other thing hey none of them none of them was found right praise the Lord that book is called The Church it has three sermons the church and its condition they narate they deceived the church praise the Lord now was tring waiting to go to hell and meet Satan and suffer with him but was shaking all the bones were shaking he felt a voice behind him it said for sure he lied and he was not faithful but love that part he stood for me he stood for me in the world and for that cause I've come to stand in for him the the eyes of the one saw there were more than a parent and the child it was Jesus Christ hallelujah praise the Lord and then he said me Lord help me because I stood before you also you stand for me and I want to tell you you don't depend don't say that they will stand for me Calvary stood for you you he paid for them what you have to do to get them and throw them there and you remain free on that day you will be found faithful there is no Jesus that will take you lying you have the power to take away lies from you speak the truth whether you remain with nothing and stay with God praise the Lord there are jobs where they want girls the one who is giving these jobs to women might say first come and you see me through and then I give you the job sister will you accept to be seen through the job will you get the job from the devil you sell yourself that you get a job there are very many jobs where the devil will tell you the way he told Jesus if you a Son of God first speak to those stonies when youcame that took him in Pride it is return fall off because he saying he will bring his angels to C you that is pride said it is written temp not the Lord your God praise the Lord he won't overcame that the last tempt and it is the Last Temptation even today please listen to this temptation today he took him on a high mountain and shown him all the kingdoms of the world and the world people have the world in their arms internet whatever you want it is on it is in your hands you SE the whatever you want they can give you the devil brought the whole brought the owners all the women all the wealth the money what he wanted was one kneel down I will give all that because it is mine praise the Lord now the devil to give you something he wants you to worship him if you don't bow before him I'll not give you a job we are in Satan's Eden but we want God's power to come in us so that we overcame these Temptations around us he said the prophet here The Temptations of our teenagers worse than us who were born in the days past you tell a child don't go to a video but they have the video on their phone immorality is in their hands whatever they see is enough hell looking at hell right here praise the Lord as I'm finishing up let me read this it started like this the the word molds God's character to us and anything that try to be mixed with that character breaks the you can't mix Creed with the word you can't mix the world with the word Jesus say you can't serve God and M means the world you can't be one or the other if you love the world and all the things of the world the love of God not even in you is that true then you see you can't mix you can't mix oil and water it just won't mix you can't it up do nothing you want you only add a in order to change the word you add a if you want to change the devil will give you L and you put it in word in the word there the world is lo the word is lost and the word is God the Earth is of the devil the world is of the devil get the word God and gold you change put one later you put money you can exchange money for God now people worship money instead of God says that when you love the world if you love the world you would have ch away God is love praise the Lord for that cause my brethren even the one who digs well it comes to an end I want to final to conclude I want to encourage you it is like this our Lord he has given us the word he has given us the Prophet The Prophet brought a message the prophet has restored us to Authority now we have authority our Authority let us not add L take heed of L when you get L and put it in the word it becomes the world when you get H and put it on gold you get gold so let us let us not add and let us not subtract praise the Lord but when we leave it like that we leave everything the way it is we're going to be very powerful the mighty church is the one which doesn't mix the word I've seen God work the sick get healed the other day was coming we were in convention on Thursday we in prayer and fasting that night we prayed go touch people the ones that are not sa they will believe they come out of the hands of Satan praise the Lord but when we reached they inviting me on the ppit was in the office there was some deon's office I had somebody crying who is crying when I reached there I met a woman she had demons demons we are moving around we killing you we shall take you started praying just the demon said you canot manage me I'm taking her say you're not taking her we have the one who overcame until when the demon left her but when the sister came she came to church said I want to get saved I want to get saved when we we finish ask de I want one thing I want to get saved praise the Lord there are people who are going to be just pulled to if you are a son he will pull you now when demons got hold of her he said I have no resting place anymore praise the Lord I've seen that many times one day they brought a de one two times they that one on the motorcycle was like a dead body I was preaching when they brought that person said put that person there I testified I spoke the power of God when I finished I went and prayed for that person the woman started rolling around shouting a person who was dead and then she kept quiet all of a sudden in few days in their family a demon had killed somebody they had brought girl to a church and then she died from the church so when that woman was caught up and say don't take my wife there if she dies there don't bring her back here the brought the woman praise the Lord when I pray for her I came to the CH to pit to conclude I went outside the deons they thought the person had di they met me outside Pastor you know the person is a living she's SE the Lord I knew that the demon has left praise the Lord because auth Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also the glory my father gave me I give it to you the way my father sent me I send you if we were called called to fulfill The Works he would have done on us we the one supposed to do them I asked the woman what are you deciding now said I I accept Jes they brought the woman they brought her on the pulpit proper to repent they wanted to to get hold of her then she ref that they take her when she was I told them leave her alone Jesus has delivered let her walk the woman she walked from that time she got healed the Lord when the husband was home waiting for the body she saw a woman coming walking said go and call those men [Music] we went I asked the man is this your wife said yes was she was she was dead now what she's alive I think I know God praise the Lord that man was having paralyzed legs I told him believe this Jesus to heal you so that woman has really made me suffer she took me out of my religion she took me in that one me the other one now I don't want to follow her anymore I told her don't follow the woman there is a God that has healed your wife you believe that [Music] God what you do pray for me but getting saved leave it for me the man was s there the legs were paralyzed hands on him I pray for him in a little time got walking outside you see what Jesus has done for you believe and be saved and leave all the alcohol and all other things he said leave that for me we left but now that man also God

was being they brought the woman the B man was TI and this girl had passed on they met me on the ppit I was not the one preaching they called me they took me out when I reached out so they had a girl she's like a dead body they brought her what should we do for her they just carried her off laid her down there prayed for her when pray for her I said she's healed demons have gone even the smallest touch in her words people are saying now she has totally died now in my heart I saw that she had gotten healed praise the Lord as we were there I felt that girl she has met a demon when she met a demon the demon entered into her but now it has left when I got I told others as we there the girl sat [Music] down there with the brother she sat started say where I am I went to what happened that

LIF you praise the Lord our Jesus is leaving we get him from history and we see him today alive let us not get Jesus who they spoke about the Jesus of the book The One read in the Bible the one read in let us see him with our eyes let today let him be manifested how many want to see Jesus if you are sick you are here you are going to see him because I've seen the blind eyes open paralyzed paralyzed people when they could no longer talk and they are living again because of the name of Jesus in my church I have very many elderly people who got saved who had even lost hope because of pressure all those pressures Jesus heals pressure Jesus heals cancer even heals AIDS because Jesus what brought him to give us back our The Authority is in your hands if you bring him close to you he will become you and you become him if there is any mistake you doing and your life is not right today make your life right you're going to see God way he he in the life of works in the life of Peter and you get the Holy Spirit when you get the Holy Spirit you will be Christ himself hallelujah praise the Lord I want to ask you where is Christ ah he said the world will see me no more but you you will see me because when I come I will be in you he promised it on the day of PC and he fulfilled it today Christ is here is here he in the brother when I hold his hands I'm holding Jesus's hands let us not be like Pentecost a woman a song Jesus was like a mother I would have bought for him a b if Jesus was like a father I would have bought for him a carus where is he is here if you want to buy it for buy it for him like what you do for them you do for Jesus when you do this one B you have done Jesus bad because all of us here we are a part of Jesus we are his body if you do me well you would have done Jesus well if you are okay Jesus is okay if you are bad love Jesus will be bad love let us not let us be let us not be lovers of ourselves because the spirit of this age are people but the spirit of Christ it gives you the love for the Brethren it gives you the love for God praise the Lord when your brother sleeps hry you will have slept hungry too if your brother eats you would have eaten praise the Lord when your brother buys a car you would have bought a car because it is Jesus it is Jesus but you feel jealous your jealousy for Jesus Praise Jesus I'm saying this the unity of Christ which he prayed for on the day of pente it is the Holy Spirit who B bound it together people who were in the church each one of them saw Jesus on their friends head there are pillars of T of Fire T of clo tongues of fire were on each all of them Jesus entered them the poor the rich the ones with don't have Jesus entered but after entering the Bible says they loved each other because they were not loving this body but Jesus in them hallelujah amen let us wind up saying let each one see their friend as [Music] Jesus when you see a friend like Jesus when you do bad to them it means you have harmed Jesus when you do good to them you have done Jesus good prise the Lord during that time the one the one who you could not defate them prise the Lord the one putting on a suit the one who is not putting on they will hug each other you have two would share with her I won't put on my brother is not putting on not put on I have put on all these now we said time is over we are going in the what are you going to go with are weing more material and then we say time is over where are going to God work what will those things do who will you leave them for if you don't leave them they [Music] will if you don't leave them they will stay with you because the things we have here they are to help us here one with the other the last one you are really tired I see I want to tell you this if God gives you bread he's testing you you are three and God gives you one bread if you are wise don't eat it [Music] alone else God will see your faithful when he brings you'll bring more F more than the one to give you but so that you go back he brings more the Lord because God is looking for the faithful the one that will help others that will become Jesus to others Hallelujah there are nowhere to be seen he one other but the one multiplied his and 10 the one with got four the one with one he it but when Jesus came he started with the one with five I want my dinner I gave you my my

faithful the truth you have stand with it be like it when I preach here I take the words I speak I don't want to speak on day that I be when I'm not worthy I want to speak [Music] don't speak beyond your level because what we speak the Lord Our Lives speak louder than our words all the things have spoken I want you to search about my if if my life resembles what I've spoken it is very easy to speak and it is different to to do says many will come we preached oh that man can preach but my preaching it is not what I'm standing on I'm standing on the Life of Christ Jesus in my life but when I preach and I don't leave I will not be you not be rewarded because you're a message believer you will be rewarded because you have the life of the I pray the sick Jesus is still healing if you have some habit you're still holding on to if you don't leave it and you get the Holy Spirit believing the message won't take you to heaven praise the Lord being called I was baptized in the name of Jesus I go to church every I play the piano I play this the guitar I preach that won't take you to heaven what takes you to heaven it is Christ being manifested in your life because Christ is going to take his word he's not going to take me Sunday he's taking the word the word that is in me I am like I am like S I am like a bottle a bottle cares but when you go to the shop buy s that is in the [Music] bottle God will see what is in you if you have kept it well and then it will take you also how many are saying praise the [Applause] Lord if you here and you're sick this is your day the Lord has brought me for that cas if you not saved this is your day to take Christ and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you be because there is only one family which God knows that is that family that family and its head is Jesus if you enter in Jesus you have entered in that family the blood of Jesus it is the Life of Christ it is no longer the blood but it is the spirit the when it enters into you you and God you become one I pray Days Are Over time is over no long have time clock is Israel as we hear the MOs has been taken out the Gentiles their chance will be over if you have not

to give cheerfully amen not pushed not forced a free will offering and we give with all our hearts can we say a big Amen on that amen Hallelujah we here believe in giving when the pastor was sharing the testimony I remember you my [Music] sister praise God come come right [Music] here here is Sister Esther and uh she got a problem she would just faint and disappear for many hours and she came she came in the church her mother brought her here just before actually had sent her back home because she was fainting nobody knew the problem we have a doctor here he couldn't find the medically it started by giving blood it started by giving blood so when she gave blood she started fainting so um and then after everything she continued after the medication she continued they checked blood blood so we realized it was a devil but here is a testimony she came I don't know how many of you remember that the last day she came in the church She fainted right here where she standed and she was there I was praying for people I did not notice that she had fainted so when I came touched her real she had fainted but you see I was so mad at the Devil and I started to rebuke the devil and I prayed from our sister's healing so Pastor said that when he prayed for that woman they thought she had died because she no response but God revealed to him she had been healed and so when our sister when I prayed for her I believed God that she's here and I called her mother to come take her away we continue praying but she just told me since that last Fain thear she never had another one and she did all our exams and completed them let me ask you sister who you that is Jesus Christ sister that is Jesus CHR don't doubt it and we have a living God and now you are standing on the same place the Bible says there will be like like how does the Bible say it like we will St over them our enemies they will be under the swords of our the devil belongs under the of your praise God so as you step over him over your enemy he's under your feet if you feel he's right here devil can you please go back to your place go back under myet amen amen well sister you can stomp over the devil and tell him no more Fain walk by faith Hallelujah no more fainting hallelujah amen whenever he comes back you tell the devil under my feet the message we are preaching to you is not only words it is life this end
