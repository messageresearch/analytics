[0:01] uh I've also been requested to speak to
[0:03] evening light bright uh
[0:09] fellowship and so they are going to be
[0:11] streaming this service on their
[0:16] zoom and so I send our greetings to the
[0:20] Saints at evening
[0:24] light may the Lord bless each of you and
[0:27] Grant the desires of your heart
[0:32] shall we please turn to First
[0:38] John vers
[0:44] 4 chter 4 verse 17
[0:52] rather
[0:56] amen we read from 17 to 19 as you know
[0:59] when whenever we are speaking to the
[1:01] Saints on Zoom we always have but one
[1:07] hour and so uh you always try to catch
[1:11] me quickly so I don't have to take a
[1:12] long time uh laying a a big
[1:17] [Music]
[1:19] foundation you can do that if you focus
[1:24] right and then the Lord will bless
[1:27] you so we're reading from verse 17
[1:31] here in is our love made perfect that we
[1:33] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:37] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:43] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:46] love casts out
[1:48] fear because fear has
[1:51] torment he that fearth is not made
[1:54] perfect in love we love him because he
[1:58] first loved us
[2:05] [Music]
[2:14] [Music]
[2:21] [Music]
[2:28] for
[2:42] amen may be
[2:45] seated uh for a while now my mind has
[2:48] been going around the subject of
[2:54] love and so today I did not know what
[2:57] exactly I was going to speak on
[3:02] but then I had that
[3:05] fear and so I'm going to speak on
[3:09] fear this evening fear tell your
[3:12] neighbor
[3:14] fear even by speaking that word fear you
[3:17] already are
[3:20] fearing so you don't know what I might
[3:24] fear and so there are two categories of
[3:26] fear in the
[3:28] Bible the first category of fear is the
[3:32] fear of the
[3:34] Lord and the second category of fear is
[3:37] the spirit of
[3:39] fear now the fear of the
[3:42] Lord is not necessarily like fearing
[3:46] something
[3:49] bad but it means to respect
[3:53] God it means to have a reverence for his
[3:57] power and His glory
[4:00] [Music]
[4:03] and you also respect you have you
[4:06] respect or you have respect for his
[4:08] anger and for his
[4:09] [Music]
[4:12] wrath um it could also mean to know God
[4:16] is
[4:20] God know him as
[4:23] God and to know him as
[4:27] Supreme you know that is having the fear
[4:30] of the
[4:32] Lord to consider him in all things as
[4:35] first
[4:38] priority the reason why the people in
[4:40] the world have no fear of the
[4:44] Lord because they do not take God or
[4:47] they don't they don't know God as
[4:50] God and so they have no fear of the
[4:54] Lord and that's why they
[4:56] sin but you cannot sin
[5:00] he that is Born Again cannot
[5:03] see not because he's fearing the
[5:07] people but because he's fearing
[5:11] God what brings that distinction between
[5:14] between a Believer and a
[5:17] nonbeliever is that a nonbeliever or a
[5:20] make believer or or a fake
[5:24] believer will not will will will not do
[5:27] certain things in in in certain
[5:36] places because they fear
[5:38] man or they fear to be
[5:41] seen or they fear to be known that they
[5:44] will not that they can do such a
[5:48] thing and so they will not fear to tell
[5:51] a
[5:53] lie they will not fear to tell a
[5:56] lie because to them there's nothing
[5:59] about
[6:01] it I will tell you will ask them what is
[6:04] it that you are
[6:06] doing it's nothing because to them it's
[6:09] nothing
[6:11] much but a child of
[6:13] God it is you have the fear of the Lord
[6:17] in
[6:18] you you will fear and you will
[6:21] tremble because you consider God first
[6:24] in all things that you
[6:27] do you don't know him as just you know
[6:30] some God somewhere but you know him as
[6:33] God as Supreme in your
[6:40] life some people they even say he's a
[6:42] god of white
[6:45] people no I was going about to take a
[6:49] subject probably in the future I'll take
[6:50] a subject on that white people most of
[6:53] the white the majority of the white
[6:54] people have left
[6:58] God
[7:01] many of them no longer have the fear of
[7:03] the
[7:06] Lord and and we see that the fear of the
[7:10] Lord is the beginning of
[7:13] wisdom that's what the Bible says Every
[7:16] Nation on Earth that has
[7:20] prospered you go back in history and
[7:23] study you will find that that Nation had
[7:26] the fear of the
[7:28] Lord
[7:30] every family that has
[7:32] prospered you will find that the the
[7:34] father of that family raised or the
[7:36] mother raised the children on the basis
[7:39] of the fear of the
[7:43] Lord you will even find out that the
[7:45] father of Barack Obama was a
[7:50] Muslim and if bar Obama was raised by
[7:53] his father in
[7:56] Kenya he would never have got to that
[7:59] place of power and
[8:02] influence but he reached that he
[8:05] attained that because his mother raised
[8:07] him up on the basis of the fear of the
[8:14] Lord and so he he he was able to get to
[8:18] a place of power and
[8:23] influence
[8:25] because he re he had the reverence for
[8:28] God
[8:30] and the scripture continues on a good
[8:32] understanding have all they that do his
[8:41] Commandments his praise end
[8:45] forever so we notice that the fear of
[8:47] the Lord has good
[8:52] benefits it is the beginning of wisdom
[8:54] it's the beginning of
[8:56] knowledge it's the beginning oh it
[8:59] brings good
[9:02] understanding it leads to good life and
[9:04] to real
[9:07] life you know the fear of the Lord
[9:09] brings rest and peace to your
[9:14] soul it brings
[9:17] contentment listen it brings
[9:20] [Music]
[9:21] satisfaction in Proverbs 17 it says the
[9:24] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[9:28] knowledge
[9:30] just like in Psalms triple 1
[9:33] 10 it's the beginning of
[9:35] knowledge but then he says but
[9:38] fools despise wisdom and
[9:44] instruction so the fear of the Lord is
[9:46] the beginning of
[9:48] wisdom but but the fools despise
[9:52] wisdom meaning if you you despise
[9:56] wisdom you will not fear the lord
[9:59] and you are a
[10:00] fool that's the conclusion of the whole
[10:03] Master but I don't want to be a
[10:05] fool I want to be wise I want to be with
[10:09] good
[10:10] understanding it says but fools despise
[10:13] wisdom and
[10:16] instruction Proverbs 14:16 says a wise
[10:19] man
[10:23] fearth and depart from
[10:27] evil but the fool
[10:30] he
[10:31] rages and is
[10:34] confident even when the word of God is
[10:37] preached you will find that some people
[10:40] are
[10:41] fools that they are confident in their
[10:45] sin they're confident in their LIF
[10:49] style and they're not willing to live
[10:51] that
[10:54] lifestyle because they are
[10:56] fools but he says a wise man Fe
[11:00] feest and depart from
[11:04] Evil so what is that kind of fear that
[11:07] is the fear of the
[11:10] Lord and in Proverbs
[11:13] 14:15 it says a simple believeth every
[11:16] the simple believeth every
[11:20] word but The Prudent man lookth well to
[11:23] his
[11:27] going a wise man man
[11:30] fearth and depart from
[11:33] evil but the fool
[11:37] raes and is
[11:40] confident he keeps on repeating these
[11:44] words now why wouldn't why wouldn't uh
[11:48] uh a man want to have
[11:52] wisdom why wouldn't he want to follow
[11:57] instruction because they are
[12:01] fool and the scripture then says a fool
[12:04] has said in his
[12:07] heart there is no
[12:10] God but I trust you that are listening
[12:13] to me this
[12:15] evening you believe there is a God in
[12:18] heaven and you don't believe only that
[12:21] there is a God in
[12:23] heaven but you believe that he is the
[12:26] only
[12:27] God
[12:30] and is the
[12:31] absolute and is the master of of your
[12:34] life and is the
[12:37] ultimate and
[12:39] absolute and that he the fearing him is
[12:42] the beginning of all
[12:45] wisdom and fearing him brings good
[12:50] understanding listen here in Proverbs
[12:54] 14:26 he says in the fear of the
[12:57] Lord is strong
[13:00] confidence and his children shall have a
[13:03] place of
[13:05] [Music]
[13:06] Refuge the fear of the Lord is a
[13:09] Fountain of
[13:11] Life to depart from the snares of
[13:16] death meaning if you fear the
[13:19] lord you will not come into the snares
[13:22] of
[13:24] the the devil lays
[13:27] snares of every
[13:30] believer in whichever area of
[13:34] Life the devil will try to
[13:38] snare the devil will try to snare me he
[13:42] will try to snare you but then what did
[13:45] he say here he says the fear of the
[13:48] Lord is a Fountain of
[13:51] [Music]
[13:52] Life and he says to depart from
[13:56] it his snar of death and that's why
[13:59] brother sister we should never depart
[14:01] from the fear of the
[14:04] Lord it is the fear of the Lord that
[14:08] will bring us to
[14:09] repentance it is the fear of the Lord
[14:12] that will will keep us within the the
[14:14] context of the
[14:17] word if it wasn't for
[14:19] that that is in our
[14:22] hearts many of us would have been in the
[14:26] world many of us many of you listening
[14:29] to me tonight you would have been in the
[14:32] world we have the power to do the things
[14:34] the world
[14:36] does but because of the fear of the Lord
[14:39] is not something you make up it is
[14:42] something that amen God binds up in your
[14:47] soul amen it just kind of gives you that
[14:51] fear I've heard and I've seen and spoken
[14:54] to many
[14:56] Believers told me I was on the brink of
[14:59] going into
[15:01] sin but Som that moment fear came over
[15:05] me and I couldn't go through with what
[15:09] was that it was the fear of the
[15:12] Lord what does it do it says it is a
[15:14] Fountain of
[15:17] Life Proverbs
[15:19] 19:23 the fear of the Lord tendeth to
[15:24] life and he that has it shall abide
[15:34] satisfied tell your neighbor you'll be
[15:37] satisfied if you have the fear of the
[15:40] Lord he shall not be visted with
[15:43] evil if you fear the lord evil shall not
[15:47] come in your house evil shall not come
[15:50] in your day evil shall not come where
[15:54] you may try to come but it cannot abide
[15:57] in there
[16:00] in a place in a
[16:01] house in an individual that has the fear
[16:04] of the
[16:05] Lord praise the name of the Lord It's
[16:09] the fear of the Lord that called David
[16:10] to
[16:12] repentance was a man he was a
[16:14] king he feared
[16:17] nobody like all Kings who become
[16:21] fools for thinking that because they are
[16:23] Kings they there's nobody above
[16:27] them we have a record of them in the
[16:30] scriptures and also in history kings
[16:34] that have not feared
[16:36] God and God brought them
[16:40] down but we find that all kings that
[16:42] feared
[16:43] God God loved them God gave them long
[16:47] life God blessed them because of the
[16:51] fear of the Lord it brought them down to
[16:52] repentance each time they
[16:56] sin I remember when David sinned David
[17:00] committed
[17:01] immorality and murder and when this
[17:04] happened in his
[17:06] life you know and the prophet of God
[17:08] came and gave a
[17:11] prophecy and he told him what he had
[17:14] done the fear of the Lord came upon him
[17:17] and he faed a war and began crying to
[17:19] the Lord and we know he said God I get
[17:22] us you and you only have I
[17:25] seen what a king this was a man that
[17:29] knew that nobody in Israel was above
[17:33] him but there is something he had and it
[17:36] was called the fear of the
[17:39] Lord the the fear of the Lord took him
[17:43] away from
[17:45] death and God loved David and God
[17:48] blessed David and God told David I'll
[17:51] give you an everlasting
[17:54] house give you an everlasting
[17:56] Kingdom and David was blessed all
[18:00] through and yet when his son
[18:04] came Solomon he did not fear the
[18:08] lord after building the Temple after
[18:11] doing everything he did later on he
[18:15] builds houses of other
[18:18] gods and because he didn't fear God by
[18:20] doing
[18:22] that God removed
[18:24] him and he put his
[18:27] servant be a king brethren we should
[18:30] fear
[18:31] God our God is a living God the Bible
[18:35] says a consuming
[18:37] fire praise the name of the Lord and but
[18:40] then tonight I don't want to speak and
[18:42] dwell so much on the fear of the
[18:46] Lord I want to speak on the spirit of
[18:51] fear I want to dwell on that for the
[18:53] remaining
[18:56] minute and this is the spirit of fear
[18:58] that B is speaking of in the book of
[18:59] First
[19:02] John it says heing is our love made
[19:08] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[19:11] day of
[19:14] judgment brother you have to rectify my
[19:17] sound I cannot hear myself well that we
[19:19] may have boldness in the day of
[19:23] judgment because as he is so are we in
[19:27] this world
[19:29] [Music]
[19:31] and then he says there is no fear in
[19:36] love but perfect
[19:39] love C out
[19:41] fear tell your neighbor perfect
[19:45] love
[19:47] fear in the message
[19:50] expectation the prophet says this now
[19:53] fear has no valuation in
[19:57] it
[19:59] none
[20:01] whatsoever is perfectly
[20:05] endless it doesn't it it hasn't got one
[20:09] thing good about
[20:12] it if it was it says if I was to be a to
[20:17] be short in the
[20:19] [Music]
[20:20] morning I was if I was going to be short
[20:23] in the
[20:24] morning what good would it
[20:27] be
[20:29] to have
[20:31] fear what good would it do to
[20:34] me you say well what good would would
[20:37] Faith do to
[20:41] you Faith could deliver
[20:44] me but fear won't help me a
[20:49] bit you just get yourself all worked
[20:54] up and more
[20:57] nervous than ever when it comes time for
[21:00] the gun to
[21:04] fire by the time they bring a gun on
[21:06] your
[21:08] head you've already wasted
[21:12] yourself you already look so
[21:16] bad you you've already swe out swe it
[21:19] out you are so
[21:21] nervous your heart is
[21:24] bumping you've exed on
[21:27] yourself
[21:29] because of
[21:30] fear but he says if I was going to be
[21:32] executed in the
[21:35] morning what good does it have for me to
[21:40] fear fear has no valuation in
[21:46] me none
[21:49] whatever it is perfectly
[21:53] endless it doesn't it doesn't it hasn't
[21:57] go to One Thing about
[22:00] it so you say well what about
[22:04] faith what does faith do to
[22:06] you and he says faith could deliver
[22:10] me faith will deliver
[22:12] you but fear won't help me a
[22:17] bit you just get yourself all walked up
[22:19] and more
[22:22] nervous and then when the time comes to
[22:25] fire you are so nervous
[22:30] he says let's have
[22:33] faith faith could deliver
[22:36] me but it doesn't but if it
[22:40] doesn't what good would fear do
[22:48] anyhow I Thought I Loved this qu so
[22:52] much Faith could deliver
[22:54] me but if it
[22:56] doesn't good would fear do
[23:01] anyhow so he said just stay right with
[23:06] faith and hold on to
[23:09] him take God's
[23:12] promise and remain with
[23:15] God we've had a lot of people in the
[23:19] Bible here has our examples who have had
[23:22] no fear absolutely
[23:25] whatever we can talk about like uh uh
[23:30] like
[23:32] Daniel when they told D when a law was
[23:36] passed Daniel knew it was targeting
[23:40] him because he was worshiping
[23:43] God and and the law was passed that no
[23:45] one should worship any other
[23:50] God and so when Daniel heard
[23:52] it he even went and opened the
[23:56] windows he said so you don't want me to
[24:00] pray I will pray and I will open the
[24:04] windows so you can see me praying here
[24:07] is a man who had no
[24:09] fear brother sister when you are faced
[24:12] with
[24:14] adversity when you faced with
[24:16] trouble face it like a man or woman of
[24:21] God have no fear to what the devil can
[24:23] do to
[24:25] you stand boldly before
[24:29] I will even open my
[24:32] windows because the God I
[24:34] serve can deliver
[24:37] me even if he doesn't believe deliv me
[24:41] what good is it for me to
[24:43] fear I will not fear and he opened the
[24:47] windows and and they saw him praying so
[24:51] they quickly went to the king they send
[24:53] the man is praying said which man one of
[24:57] yours
[24:59] Daniel he said are you sure he said yes
[25:03] so they brought him said Daniel
[25:06] yes if it was you would
[25:11] you have you been
[25:16] praying they did not actually said the
[25:19] truth because yeah I was like praying
[25:21] but exactly
[25:23] I that is
[25:25] fear but Daniel say
[25:28] yes do what you will I have no fear why
[25:32] because I have the word of
[25:34] God I'm standing right on the Promises
[25:36] of
[25:37] God he knew that the prayer that David
[25:40] had
[25:42] prayed that when they would look to this
[25:46] Temple no matter where they
[25:48] are you would deliver them and he was
[25:52] praying looking towards the
[25:55] temple he was looking towards the
[25:58] promise not towards
[26:01] fear look beyond your
[26:04] fear I say look beyond your
[26:07] fear and see the promises of
[26:09] God they will shortly come to
[26:13] pass and right at that
[26:15] moment you know they said now you have
[26:19] to be thrown to the lionist
[26:22] den oh my good Lord if it was
[26:26] you maybe begin
[26:28] immediately
[26:30] shaking after all you're going to be
[26:32] thrown in the
[26:34] light and you wouldn't know that you
[26:36] wouldn't know what it is but you would
[26:38] hear
[26:40] water all over your
[26:44] pants you're going to be lionist lunch
[26:49] today that's what the Bible says the
[26:52] devil is like a roing
[26:54] lion but I said have no fear
[26:58] our God is not like a lowering
[27:01] lion our God is a
[27:03] lion of the tribe of
[27:05] Judah and he has prevailed over the
[27:09] devil oh hallelujah hallelujah and so
[27:12] right there you know when he was thrown
[27:15] in he had no fear and when he reached
[27:18] there the man had no fear the Lions
[27:22] looked at
[27:24] him hi
[27:26] Daniel
[27:30] so you're not eating
[27:31] me so you know me yeah Daniel we know
[27:35] you it's only a lion which has no
[27:38] fear and the lion So Daniel as another
[27:43] lion because because another lion was in
[27:47] Daniel the Bible says that greater is he
[27:49] that is in you than he that is in the
[27:53] world it is the devil in the world that
[27:56] lay snares to make you
[28:00] fear but it is God that is in you that
[28:03] gives you
[28:05] boldness in the face of
[28:08] trouble and when he stood before that
[28:12] lion he had no fear he had no fear and
[28:17] he looked at the Lions and was singing
[28:19] and playing with them the whole
[28:21] time singing songs that man knows
[28:25] nothing
[28:26] about
[28:28] lion is so
[28:30] F when I was in
[28:32] Zimbabwe I touched a
[28:34] lion oh boy oh
[28:37] boy I I know then I knew what fear
[28:42] is when I touched that
[28:44] L I touched its
[28:47] R and just like like
[28:52] on and I was just pressing it like that
[28:57] one second less than one
[29:00] second its mouth was where my finger
[29:08] was they told me yes that's how fast
[29:12] that Beast can
[29:14] be when did
[29:18] [Music]
[29:20] thatw don't kill me it was it was in the
[29:24] net in in the whatever blocked somewhere
[29:29] but even
[29:30] then I don't know what I almost did I
[29:32] will not tell
[29:35] you is real but fear is a
[29:40] spirit but hallelujah hallelujah God has
[29:43] not given us the spirit of
[29:47] fear amen and so we notice there was
[29:50] another people we always talk about
[29:56] them
[29:58] when these boys were told that you
[29:59] should not bow to any other God but only
[30:02] the the god this
[30:06] image when you hear the drums when you
[30:09] hear then bow down they they remained
[30:13] standing they gave them another chance
[30:16] they remained
[30:17] standing I want you to understand this
[30:20] was an entire
[30:22] Kingdom bowing down but these three boys
[30:26] refus to bow
[30:29] even if you are the only one who shall
[30:30] refuse brother to bow down to the devil
[30:33] do not bow down to the
[30:37] devil even if everybody else would agree
[30:40] to
[30:41] Bow but I agree not to
[30:45] bow amen our
[30:47] strength is not in agreement with
[30:51] others our strength is in agreement with
[30:54] the
[30:55] word if you agree with the word then God
[30:59] is right beside
[31:01] you to accomplish his
[31:04] promise you agree with
[31:06] man man will forsake you at the time
[31:10] when you need them but God cannot
[31:13] forsake you the Bible says a present
[31:18] help in the time of
[31:22] trouble and if you believe him like
[31:25] that even in the time of trouble
[31:28] you will have no
[31:29] fear what the devil will do against your
[31:33] life and that moment they said Will Not
[31:37] Bow look your boys we are going to burn
[31:40] up this furnace again and recind it
[31:43] again and
[31:45] again seven times and if you don't bow
[31:49] we will throw you in there they said
[31:52] Bring it
[31:53] on Bring it on we will not bow to the
[31:57] condition of the
[32:00] time did you know that fear has never
[32:03] been
[32:04] holistic fear is always consequential
[32:08] it's
[32:12] like fear I don't know whe I said that
[32:15] right but fear is always for the
[32:20] moment how many of you feared at one
[32:22] point in
[32:25] life all right how many of you who that
[32:28] who feared at one point in
[32:31] life and then later on you realize why
[32:33] did I
[32:36] fear later
[32:40] on I remember when I was in school one
[32:43] time uh there was a teacher who usually
[32:46] here in Uganda I don't know whether they
[32:47] are beating these days do they beat now
[32:49] noways
[32:52] students yes
[32:55] good oh we used to get Enzo
[32:59] really so now there was these teachers
[33:02] who would make you lie like a
[33:05] snake and and and he would bring
[33:10] thato and the English speakers will not
[33:13] understand what we talking about BYO and
[33:15] but I don't know he would bring a stripe
[33:19] a rod it is just like a
[33:21] rod and and he would bring it down on
[33:25] you I I would say he would rain it down
[33:29] on
[33:32] you and so uh he said this teacher would
[33:36] say anybody below this
[33:40] Mark I'm going to give you
[33:43] five you you know you are
[33:46] gone so now then after he says that then
[33:51] he brings the
[33:53] papers even by the time he's bringing
[33:55] the
[33:55] papers
[33:57] you are shaking
[33:59] already because not the way you
[34:02] perform you don't know whether you
[34:04] reached that
[34:05] much so by the time by the time he
[34:07] brings your paper you
[34:11] already and by the time you look at your
[34:13] paper your hand is
[34:16] shaking and if you see you are past the
[34:21] mark you can even even fall down in
[34:25] appreciation
[34:27] you just feel fear
[34:29] leaving but when you realize that you
[34:32] are below the
[34:35] mark you will go back to your
[34:38] chair but you you will feel it
[34:41] hot you can't even sit down some of us
[34:45] would not
[34:46] sit would just kneel down there because
[34:49] you you know you're
[34:51] waiting to receive
[34:54] the and then one day the teacher did
[34:58] that and at the end of the day um you
[35:02] know he spoke and he spoke and he spoke
[35:05] the road was there he spoke and he
[35:08] spoke and the session
[35:11] ended he said you have
[35:14] survived you have survived but I was
[35:17] going
[35:18] to now we wonder now why did we
[35:22] Fe after has not beaten us from that
[35:25] moment said fear will no longer
[35:29] control because I know after after the
[35:34] fear you will not fear again do you hear
[35:37] me after fear there is no
[35:40] fear fear is only for that
[35:43] moment but the devil will try to bring
[35:45] many things in your
[35:47] life which will bring fear in your
[35:51] spirit and these things many times may
[35:53] be
[35:55] sickness it may be words that you have
[35:58] heard it may be things that maybe people
[36:01] have done to you it may be anything and
[36:05] then all of the sudden it will bring a
[36:07] blanket of fear over
[36:09] you but this is only for a
[36:12] moment but the devil will show it to you
[36:14] as if it for a
[36:17] lifetime maybe you don't have
[36:19] money I want to tell you it's only for a
[36:23] moment maybe you have notion it's only
[36:26] for moment maybe you are sick it's only
[36:30] for a
[36:31] moment maybe you have issues in your
[36:34] family or in the church it's only for a
[36:38] moment but I tell you what we have an
[36:41] eternal
[36:42] God who is over and Beyond a
[36:46] moment he an everlasting God he there
[36:50] before fear he will be there after fear
[36:55] fear has no power
[36:57] before our living God and all they that
[37:00] trust in him amen have no fear also for
[37:05] there is no fear in
[37:07] love and so we notice these boys said we
[37:10] shall not
[37:12] bow do what you will they they they they
[37:16] boil up the
[37:17] fire seven times
[37:21] comption the fire was completely
[37:25] hot the devil
[37:27] your
[37:29] mind until he even brings you know what
[37:32] we call
[37:35] nervousness nervous there are people who
[37:37] become
[37:40] nervous and then others begin to fear
[37:44] begin to feel kind of
[37:47] depression so
[37:49] sad that that feeling has overwhelmed
[37:54] you but that comes out of of
[37:58] fear and others think that when they go
[38:00] to the
[38:02] psychiatrist psychiatrist will help them
[38:05] let me tell you what you need you only
[38:08] need a holy ghost filled
[38:10] person to come to you and cast out that
[38:14] fear because fear is a
[38:17] spirit and he said fear brings
[38:20] torment that's why to a Believer who is
[38:23] walking right with God no matter what
[38:26] comes no matter what goes you will have
[38:30] no fear what the devil will do what
[38:33] devil will
[38:34] sayil will why because you know where
[38:38] you are standing you are standing on the
[38:40] solid
[38:41] rock the Rock of Ages the rock of the
[38:45] world the three boys said we shall not
[38:49] have
[38:51] anything as long as we know the
[38:53] promise and they took them they had no
[38:57] fear they pulled them they had no fear
[39:01] the devil might have taken you he might
[39:03] have pulled you might have done whatever
[39:05] you done to you but I say have no
[39:08] fear hallelujah amen where is taking you
[39:14] in the fire our God is a consuming
[39:20] fire amen when he dragged them to the
[39:24] fire all of them got
[39:28] B but the boys themselves were in the
[39:33] fire dancing God
[39:36] hallelujah Glory hallelujah our god is
[39:39] consuming
[39:40] fire let me tell you brother sister oh
[39:45] Hallelujah let me tell you why we listen
[39:48] to the word every
[39:49] time because the word casts out
[39:53] fear God is the
[39:55] word word is love he says with God in
[40:01] love there is no
[40:03] fear perfect love cast out fear so when
[40:08] we hear the word you
[40:10] getc praise God and I want to say to you
[40:13] this evening if the devil has dragged
[40:15] you in the
[40:17] fire don't fear because when you are in
[40:20] the fire you are in
[40:23] Victory why because he that made the
[40:26] fire
[40:27] is right there in the
[40:30] fire amen you pray oh God send a sign s
[40:35] an angel send this one send a
[40:39] word and God may not answer all those
[40:42] prayers if God has not oh there's
[40:44] somebody who asked a question here why
[40:47] do I feel God is not answering my
[40:49] prayer here is your answer if you feel
[40:52] that God is not answering your
[40:54] prayer he's waiting to answer in a
[40:56] greater
[41:00] way why pray oh God come and consume
[41:06] all come and strike the the
[41:10] image come and when they caught them
[41:14] come and strike all of
[41:16] them
[41:18] nothing God was waiting the angels in
[41:21] heaven were like oh God your people are
[41:23] being taken your people are being taken
[41:26] let us
[41:27] go say Let Me Go water God said
[41:32] no okay let me go and bring fire no let
[41:36] me go and
[41:38] bring he stopped all the
[41:41] wind God was
[41:43] prepared to answer the call
[41:47] himself and when the king saw he said
[41:50] didn't we throw three men in the
[41:53] fire why do I see four
[41:56] and the first of
[41:59] one is like the son of
[42:02] man who was he who is he he is the one
[42:07] in
[42:08] you he is the one here they saw him as a
[42:14] separate one but you don't see him
[42:17] because he's in
[42:19] you that's why I told you you are
[42:21] greater than you
[42:24] know because he that is in us he's
[42:29] greater than he that is in the
[42:30] world he's greater than any
[42:33] discouragement or
[42:36] fear he came down in a moment and fire
[42:41] meant
[42:43] nothing so they had no
[42:45] fear but even if he did not serve
[42:48] them they were ready to
[42:50] die but not
[42:53] fearful they were not yes don't be
[42:56] fearful
[42:57] brother don't worry even if God doesn't
[42:59] save
[43:00] you
[43:02] die
[43:05] strong
[43:08] Fearless standing on
[43:12] the if God doesn't heal you don't you

[43:27] deliver
[43:31] you some of said I can't overcome this I
[43:33] can't overcome this I can't overcome
[43:37] that Believers we are supposed to be
[43:41] soldiers we are fighting a
[43:44] battle and we are fighting until we
[43:47] overcome if we will not overcome we will
[43:51] die
[43:52] [Music]
[43:53] fighting
[43:55] fighting don't come out of the ring
[43:58] don't fear it's the fearful that go out
[44:00] of the
[44:01] ring stay in the ring even if your

[44:06] giant fight with him until you overcome
[44:10] him if you don't overcome him die
[44:15] trying but I want to say our go has been
[44:20] tested Our God has been proved over and
[44:25] over
[44:28] that he cannot fail that he does not
[44:31] fail wor about what I'm saying it's
[44:34] about what he
[44:36] saying it has been time
[44:40] tested there for wife
[44:43] Fe praise
[44:46] God just stay right with
[44:49] faith and hold on to
[44:51] it take God's
[44:54] promise and remain with
[44:58] God in the message in the church age
[45:01] book The Church
[45:04] AG I'll read you this quot
[45:06] now God says this church of the Lan age
[45:09] is
[45:12] wred wretched or wretched or
[45:15] whatever that word comes from two Greek
[45:18] words which means endure and
[45:23] trial endure and trial
[45:27] endure and try
[45:31] yes praise God and he says and it has
[45:35] nothing to do with the trials that come
[45:37] to a true Christian for God describes a
[45:39] Christian in trial as
[45:45] blessed no this is not about a Christian
[45:47] because this is not theud church is
[45:52] wretched
[45:54] wretched find a word in the in in
[45:56] Revelation chapter
[45:58] 3 vers something
[46:02] there they're wred and blind naked
[46:04] wretched and blind did you get it
[46:07] quickly we don't have much time now and
[46:10] it has nothing to do it says with the
[46:12] trials did you find it
[46:13] brother chapter
[46:16] 3 anybody found
[46:20] it vers 18 no no no vers
[46:24] um
[46:28] verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich
[46:30] and increased with goods and have need
[46:31] of nothing but thou knowest not that
[46:33] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[46:35] and blind and
[46:54] naked uhuh so the word comes from two
[46:57] Greek words which means endure and
[47:03] trial and it has nothing to do with the
[47:05] trials that come to a
[47:08] Christian because for God does not
[47:10] describe for God to a Christian he
[47:12] describes a trial as a as
[47:19] blessed and his attitude and his
[47:22] attitude one of joy is one of Joy
[47:24] whereas this description here is phrased
[47:28] as wretched and
[47:32] [Music]
[47:42] miserable how strange Listen Listen Now
[47:44] quickly now how
[47:46] strange in this age of
[47:49] Plenty in this age of
[47:51] progress in this age of
[47:54] abundance how can there be
[47:57] trials well now it is
[48:00] strange but in this age of Plenty and
[48:04] opportunity when everyone has so much
[48:06] and there is so much more to be
[48:09] [Music]
[48:10] had it says what with all the inventions
[48:14] to do uh uh what with all the inventions
[48:17] to do our work and so many things to
[48:19] give
[48:24] pleasure but
[48:26] suddenly we find mental
[48:30] illness taking such at allll as to the
[48:38] nation even here in Uganda the mental
[48:41] cases are becoming more and
[48:43] [Music]
[48:44] more when everybody ought to be
[48:48] happy with really nothing to be unhappy
[48:53] about millions are taking sedatives
[48:58] night I don't know how if there are
[49:00] people who do it
[49:03] here even many believers
[49:06] do let me tell you if you
[49:08] do if you do take stivs to
[49:12] sleep oh it's not
[49:15] evil but I tell you you can be delivered
[49:17] off of
[49:19] that God can take you out of
[49:22] it because that is not your portion
[49:26] the Bible says he give his beloved
[49:32] sleep praise the name of the Lord and he
[49:35] says when everybody ought to be happy
[49:37] with really nothing to be unhappy
[49:41] about millions are taking stives at
[49:45] night he says pills in the
[49:50] morning rushing to
[49:52] doctors entering institutions
[49:57] and nothing listen and trying to drown
[50:01] out unknown fears by
[50:11] alcohol they're trying to drown that
[50:15] fear with
[50:17] alcohol do you know many people who are
[50:19] taking alcohol and
[50:22] drugs because of fears
[50:25] [Music]
[50:26] they are living in
[50:28] fear they in
[50:30] bondage yes this age B of his tremendous
[50:33] stores of worldly
[50:37] Goods but the people are less happy than
[50:43] ever this B of its spiritual
[50:49] attainments but people are less sure of
[50:51] themselves than
[50:54] ever this age B of better moral
[50:59] values and it is more corrupt than any
[51:01] age since the
[51:06] flag it talks about his knowledge and
[51:11] science but it is fighting and losing a
[51:13] battle in all
[51:17] fields for the human
[51:19] mind and soul Spirit cannot
[51:24] comprehend
[51:28] keep up bre with all the changes that
[51:30] have come upon the
[51:35] Earth in one generation we have gone all
[51:37] the way from the horse and B ede to the
[51:39] space
[51:43] ede and we are proud and bful about
[51:47] it but this
[51:49] generation inside the
[51:51] peop is a Dark
[51:54] Void
[51:55] C that is crying out in
[52:00] torment you know the scripture said that

[52:10] reason many's hearts are failing for
[52:17] fear and the world is s darken that this
