[1:15:31] seat praise to
[1:15:38] God blessed be the name of the
[1:15:42] Lord
[1:15:44] amen yeah where we have
[1:15:47] read in John chapter
[1:15:52] 11 uh we are seeing something here
[1:15:57] about Lazarus
[1:16:01] Resurrection we are seeing Jesus rising
[1:16:04] Lazarus from the
[1:16:06] dead and we also
[1:16:10] believe that if the rupture
[1:16:15] delays and maybe
[1:16:18] uh maybe we grow
[1:16:23] old or maybe
[1:16:26] you are taken by another
[1:16:29] means May by the way of
[1:16:33] accident or maybe you drown in the
[1:16:37] sea we believe that in the day of
[1:16:41] Resurrection you shall
[1:16:43] rise and that's why we sing that song
[1:16:47] and say that in the resurrection
[1:16:50] morning we shall
[1:16:53] rise blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:16:56] we are seeing Jesus proving to us that
[1:17:01] it is
[1:17:02] possible amen am because himself
[1:17:07] says I am the resurrection and
[1:17:11] life and remember he told them destroy
[1:17:15] this
[1:17:17] temple in three days I'll build it up
[1:17:21] and they thought that was talking about
[1:17:24] the
[1:17:26] Temple but he was talking about his body
[1:17:30] death
[1:17:33] and blessed be the name of the
[1:17:36] Lord
[1:17:38] amen John chapter
[1:17:41] 11 ver 38
[1:17:44] says Jesus therefore again groining in
[1:17:46] himself cometh to the
[1:17:50] Grave J
[1:17:52] 11:36 yeah 11:36 where just where you
[1:17:56] from
[1:17:58] Reading
[1:18:01] I
[1:18:03] that it's John
[1:18:16] 11
[1:18:19] amen that is 38 yes and Jesus
[1:18:23] said
[1:18:27] take ye away the
[1:18:33] stone mother the sister of him that was
[1:18:40] dead said unto him
[1:18:44] Lord but this
[1:18:47] time his
[1:18:51] stink blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:18:55] Lazarus was a family Jesus was a family
[1:18:57] friend of
[1:19:00] Lazarus and Jesus loved them so
[1:19:04] much and one day when Jesus was in the
[1:19:08] ministry he was preaching another
[1:19:11] side and Lazarus became
[1:19:15] sick and the sickness
[1:19:18] increased
[1:19:20] amen until Lazarus
[1:19:23] died blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:19:27] when they told Jesus that Lazarus had
[1:19:31] died he did not come that very
[1:19:36] day blessed be the name of the
[1:19:40] Lord remember that Jesus of the Old
[1:19:44] Testament Jesus of the New
[1:19:47] Testament is the Jehovah of the Old
[1:19:51] Testament the creator of the heavens and
[1:19:53] earth
[1:19:55] the one who knew you before you were
[1:19:58] formed he knew you before your mother
[1:20:01] got married to your
[1:20:03] father that your father would propose to
[1:20:06] your
[1:20:09] mother and you would be born through
[1:20:12] them he knows the numbers of your
[1:20:16] hair blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:20:20] Jesus knew whatever was happening around
[1:20:23] Lazarus
[1:20:26] amen and when they told him that Lazarus
[1:20:30] is
[1:20:32] dead it was not a
[1:20:35] news
[1:20:38] amen death is not news to
[1:20:45] Jesus the reason as to why you are dead
[1:20:48] in your
[1:20:50] sins why Believers some are still living
[1:20:54] in the their
[1:20:57] sins because Jesus has not come their
[1:21:03] way blessed be the name of the
[1:21:06] Lord amen but when Jesus meets
[1:21:13] death death becomes
[1:21:17] life amen amen Jesus never attended
[1:21:21] anything apart from Lazarus
[1:21:29] and guess what when he went
[1:21:33] there Jesus went
[1:21:35] there the man who was
[1:21:38] dead amen he came back to
[1:21:43] life what we need this morning to allow
[1:21:47] Jesus come your
[1:21:49] way blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:21:53] today the world is remembering
[1:21:54] resurrection of
[1:21:57] Jesus Remember death was
[1:22:01] challenge
[1:22:04] death
[1:22:05] amen in the human
[1:22:09] race right from the
[1:22:11] beginning way back from
[1:22:15] Eden if you read through the
[1:22:17] Bible you will see Giants of
[1:22:20] Faith he of
[1:22:23] faith amen many who stood with the
[1:22:27] word men who manifested
[1:22:31] God but when it comes to time of
[1:22:35] death that was their
[1:22:40] end blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:22:44] death was a big
[1:22:48] challenger but
[1:22:50] today death is no longer it does not
[1:22:53] make sense anymore
[1:22:56] to a
[1:22:57] Believer because it was like this one
[1:23:01] Sunday
[1:23:02] morning when Jesus died on
[1:23:05] Friday he was hunged on the
[1:23:09] cross and after he was
[1:23:12] buried and they brought the Roman god to
[1:23:14] guard the
[1:23:17] tomb the Roman
[1:23:20] soldiers blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:23:23] but when it was working toward
[1:23:26] morning something
[1:23:29] happened amen Jesus came out of the
[1:23:37] grave but when we when we come back to
[1:23:43] Lazarus Lazarus
[1:23:47] died 11 CH now there now a certain man
[1:23:51] was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the
[1:23:54] the town of Mary and her sister
[1:24:07] Martha it was that which Mary anointed
[1:24:09] the Lord with ointment and wiped his
[1:24:13] feet with her hair
[1:24:16] uh when Jesus heard that he uh when
[1:24:21] Jesus heard he said this sickness is not
[1:24:23] unto
[1:24:25] death when Jesus was told three says
[1:24:28] therefore his sister sent unto him
[1:24:31] saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest
[1:24:37] is
[1:24:49] sick oh what a
[1:24:53] testimony
[1:24:55] Jesus loved
[1:24:57] Lazarus to the extent that even the
[1:25:00] sisters knew
[1:25:03] that Jesus can love a
[1:25:07] Believer until the whole world will
[1:25:11] know that man is loved of
[1:25:17] God Amen Jesus can love your
[1:25:22] family until all the neighbors can
[1:25:25] witness and
[1:25:27] say that family is loved by the
[1:25:32] Lord oh a
[1:25:35] testimony when Jesus heard that he said
[1:25:39] when Jesus heard that he
[1:25:46] said this sickness is not un
[1:25:53] death
[1:25:54] when Jesus loves
[1:25:57] you and sickness comes your
[1:26:00] way and Trouble Comes Your
[1:26:03] Way thatness not
[1:26:10] death do you know why the love of
[1:26:14] God is great
[1:26:18] far that even when you go in the lowest
[1:26:21] of
[1:26:22] Hell the love of God God will bring you
[1:26:27] out Jesus knew even if the devil takes
[1:26:32] Lazarus death take
[1:26:35] Lazarus but my love for my
[1:26:38] friend when I reach there I will call
[1:26:42] him
[1:26:43] out
[1:26:45] amen he say it's not a
[1:26:49] t for the glory of
[1:26:53] God that the Son of God might be
[1:26:57] glorified there there
[1:27:06] there blessed be the name of the
[1:27:10] Lord the reason as why those things are
[1:27:14] there because God wanted to manifest
[1:27:17] want to manifest his glory in your
[1:27:21] life the reason why we are tried
[1:27:25] you go through fire a
[1:27:28] trial it is not to kill you brother
[1:27:31] sister but it's because
[1:27:34] God you want to manifest his glory in
[1:27:38] your
[1:27:41] life the Bible says many are the
[1:27:44] Affliction of the
[1:27:49] righteous but the
[1:27:52] Lord but
[1:27:55] alone not your husband not your father
[1:28:00] not your your
[1:28:01] uncle but the Lord delivers them out of
[1:28:06] it
[1:28:08] all amen amen our deliverance comes from
[1:28:12] the
[1:28:13] Lord our freedom comes from the
[1:28:16] Lord our joy comes from the
[1:28:19] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:28:23] amen amen then Jesus now Jesus loved
[1:28:26] Mara and sister and
[1:28:31] Lazarus and when he had heard this
[1:28:33] therefore he was sick he two days
[1:28:36] still in the same place where he was
[1:28:38] then after that say to his disciple let
[1:28:42] us go into Judea
[1:28:53] again
[1:29:01] brother I'm in a I'm in a dying
[1:29:06] situation remember Jesus has
[1:29:10] all
[1:29:13] amen and that's our human
[1:29:19] mentality that when I go to Mama
[1:29:22] here for a home
[1:29:26] I said Mom I need some
[1:29:28] help says oh
[1:29:30] son I'm bad
[1:29:34] love possible because by before you even
[1:29:38] went
[1:29:39] there she knew that she would help
[1:29:44] you so when the news came to
[1:29:47] Jesus amen this thought that maybe Jesus
[1:29:53] was going to go there
[1:29:56] immediately but the Bible say he AB
[1:29:58] there for two more
[1:30:04] days everything that we re see from the
[1:30:08] Lord you must be
[1:30:13] tried amen you must have
[1:30:19] patience and we learn patience by being
[1:30:22] patient
[1:30:28] it's just like how do you learn how to
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:32] pray you learn how to pray through
[1:30:38] prayer how do you learn to be
[1:30:41] patient through being patient
[1:30:44] brother there is no school of patience
[1:30:47] on
[1:30:49] us amen Jesus tried their patience
[1:30:55] that is the God we have he is the
[1:30:58] solution for our
[1:31:00] problem he can bail us any time any
[1:31:04] moment but most time he leaves
[1:31:07] us to be he leaves us to be
[1:31:10] tried because he want to see how will
[1:31:13] you
[1:31:15] react for the Bible says he led them
[1:31:19] through the
[1:31:20] Wilderness because he he led them
[1:31:23] through the wilderness
[1:31:24] because he wanted to see what was in
[1:31:26] their
[1:31:28] heart most time we
[1:31:31] pray then we gro over something we
[1:31:34] intercede over certain things and it
[1:31:37] looks like God is
[1:31:40] quiet you come again the mountain is not
[1:31:44] moving and then you start
[1:31:47] murmuring then God says you see that's
[1:31:50] what I wanted to
[1:31:52] see
[1:31:56] amen but if you keep pressing
[1:31:59] on you keep pressing on most time when
[1:32:03] you're about to give
[1:32:05] up that is when when the victory is just
[1:32:10] at the
[1:32:14] door and that's when the devil will
[1:32:17] bring a lot of things around
[1:32:19] you a lot of thoughts around you
[1:32:23] sometime after fasting and praying for
[1:32:25] three
[1:32:27] days you have been praying
[1:32:30] fasting the moment you
[1:32:34] break you receive a call and you find
[1:32:38] very annoying
[1:32:43] call has it ever happened to you you
[1:32:47] having that
[1:32:49] Revival you seeing it's all over me it's
[1:32:53] keeping
[1:32:56] life then something comes and
[1:32:58] disorganize
[1:33:00] you and you forget that it's all over
[1:33:03] you
[1:33:05] immediately that is what the devil
[1:33:08] always
[1:33:10] want my brother my
[1:33:12] sister God want patience in
[1:33:18] US
[1:33:20] amen because if he says that he made
[1:33:23] them to go that
[1:33:26] way that is God's
[1:33:31] sa which God used to save his
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:36] church
[1:33:38] amen you know when it tells us to
[1:33:40] separate from
[1:33:43] unbelief most time you find when we are
[1:33:46] still holding something with
[1:33:49] us when you believe and God gives you
[1:33:53] everything thing
[1:33:55] immediately you will go with your
[1:33:57] lipsticks and mean cuts and all
[1:34:03] those
[1:34:05] amen because people comes to church with
[1:34:09] different some with different
[1:34:13] Ambitions others come to look for
[1:34:18] sisters others come to call the church
[1:34:29] yes amen but through God
[1:34:34] receive God Tes each one of

[2:27:23] one you cannot separate those
[2:27:27] two amen the blood of Jesus it is not
[2:27:32] that chemist of the blood but that life
[2:27:35] is in the
[2:27:38] blood amen and when we talk about the
[2:27:41] blood of Jesus
[2:27:43] today in The
[2:27:45] Believer it is not that real
[2:27:49] blood
[2:27:50] amen but the life which was in
[2:27:55] Christ in The
[2:27:58] Believer receive ye the Holy
[2:28:01] Ghost and you'll have your

[2:28:06] Liberty because Jesus sets you
[2:28:11] free
[2:28:13] amen you must do
[2:28:15] something you must take that stone
[2:28:18] away let us remove the hinderances on
[2:28:21] the
[2:28:22] way Amen Let Us remove our eyes from
[2:28:26] contr
[2:28:29] storms and Look Away to
[2:28:32] Jesus
[2:28:34] amen that's why he
[2:28:37] came that's why we are here this morning
[2:28:40] you have not come for me to shout for
[2:28:42] you but you've come here because you
[2:28:45] that God had something for
[2:28:49] you praise be to
[2:28:52] God the Bible tells us that if the
[2:28:56] Angels which never hold their
[2:29:00] place we cast in high in outer
[2:29:05] Darkness how shall we
[2:29:09] escape if we neglect this great
[2:29:16] salvation
[2:29:18] amen new
[2:29:22] has
[2:29:25] everything what we
[2:29:27] need we need a new
[2:29:32] birth why ministers are
[2:29:36] toiling why converstions are being
[2:29:39] held is to point us to New
[2:29:44] Birth because Christ is taking those who
[2:29:47] are like
[2:29:49] him
[2:29:50] when we receive the holy
[2:29:53] spirit that is the portion of Christ in
[2:29:57] us but when he
[2:30:00] comes we shall meet him in the
[2:30:02] air you cannot even jump two feet from
[2:30:07] down but have you ever thought that how
[2:30:09] you going to meet him to meet him in the
[2:30:14] air do you know why some Believers in
[2:30:17] the
[2:30:18] church sometimes find them stuggling
[2:30:20] running up and
[2:30:23] down it is
[2:30:26] because inside their
[2:30:28] heart something
[2:30:31] happened and when the Great Mighty
[2:30:33] magnet comes
[2:30:36] close when he moves like this they move
[2:30:40] that
[2:30:42] side that's what we
[2:30:46] need that is what the church
[2:30:48] need that is what we ministers we
[2:30:52] need that's what you
[2:30:56] need praise be to God that's why Jesus
[2:31:01] came brother you
[2:31:05] can can speak to you yeah even when
[2:31:07] you're a
[2:31:08] Believer you also
[2:31:11] see we don't
[2:31:13] see sisters you want

[2:31:55] Liberty where Christ made us free ha
[2:32:00] made us
[2:32:02] free and be not entangled
[2:32:06] again with the Yoke of bondage 5 chapter
[2:32:09] chapter 5:
[2:32:18] 1
[2:32:29] we are very good in that I mean believe
[2:32:33] like
[2:32:35] Believers God Saves you from
[2:32:37] something and you go back and visit that
[2:32:40] dead
[2:32:45] person so when you are burning
[2:32:48] them

[2:32:55] things the world is so
