[1:09:16] several of you that I've had greeting us
[1:09:25] sir thank you for fellowshipping with us
[1:09:27] today
[1:09:32] actually most people are not here today
[1:09:34] never one traversing activity but we had
[1:09:38] sisters Stella and uh we know she went
[1:09:40] for marking Man United against
[1:09:43] and also Sister Rose Center greetings
[1:09:46] that to me uh she just returned from
[1:09:50] Lira It's a Long John I think she's
[1:09:52] never taken it before
[1:09:56] and so she's with us I think maybe by
[1:09:59] streaming that
[1:10:06] I just wanted to
[1:10:09] uh let you know that we we are on the
[1:10:13] height of the preparations for the Youth
[1:10:15] meetings
[1:10:19] how many young people here are waiting
[1:10:22] for the Youth meetings
[1:10:25] it's going to be a wonderful time I
[1:10:28] believe
[1:10:29] you're really warming up for it
[1:10:32] we're expecting a lot we are believing
[1:10:36] that the Lord will come
[1:10:38] and visit the young people
[1:10:41] I tell you what if you can be in prayer
[1:10:44] for those meetings
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:11:05] but if it happens that until then you've
[1:11:08] not received him
[1:11:11] I want to say this
[1:11:13] I believe that will be your time
[1:11:16] and maybe some of you that are
[1:11:18] struggling with things just come and
[1:11:21] come surrendered come believing and
[1:11:23] expect the marvelous to happen
[1:11:27] again
[1:11:31] so these are going to be uh meetings of
[1:11:36] creating an atmosphere
[1:11:40] for the Holy Spirit to do his work in
[1:11:44] your life
[1:11:48] um I have this a heavy burden on my
[1:11:51] heart
[1:11:53] I believe
[1:11:56] that the Lord has never disappointed us
[1:12:00] so he will not disappoint us this time
[1:12:02] also
[1:12:04] you are the speakers have already
[1:12:07] prepared themselves to come
[1:12:41] to take our
[1:12:45] uh morning devotion services
[1:12:53] if you were able to look at the program
[1:12:56] about
[1:12:58] we we will have more those morning
[1:13:01] devotions
[1:13:05] for those who sleep around who will be
[1:13:08] sleeping around
[1:13:10] and so but also anybody's welcome
[1:13:17] I don't think I need to reiterate the
[1:13:20] program because it's all over WhatsApp
[1:13:21] I'm sure how many have seen it
[1:13:25] how many have not yet seen it
[1:13:28] okay so some of you are raising your
[1:13:31] hands you're you are on the WhatsApp
[1:13:33] groups I don't know why you did not see
[1:13:35] it
[1:13:37] but if you've not seen it don't go away
[1:13:39] without seeing it ask somebody here they
[1:13:41] will just share it with you
[1:13:45] amen so we have already secured uh this
[1:13:49] place at the at the school promise which
[1:13:52] is just near here
[1:13:55] we shall be hosting all the young people
[1:13:58] that will come again
[1:14:03] um initially like I said not planned to
[1:14:05] host the young people
[1:14:10] but there seemed to be demand for read
[1:14:12] so we have organized and arranged for it
[1:14:16] and so then that calls also for a fee to
[1:14:20] support the accommodations and the food
[1:14:23] and all that
[1:14:29] so we've said I think it's the
[1:14:33] the smallest I've had in Kampala
[1:14:37] since 20
[1:14:39] 000 for everybody that you will want to
[1:14:41] spend around
[1:14:46] and that will not actually cater for
[1:14:49] everything
[1:14:52] him because many here in the church are
[1:14:54] also contributing
[1:14:57] so that will just support a little cut
[1:15:00] out
[1:15:01] so your food your your place to stay
[1:15:05] America
[1:15:07] and then of course we're going to be
[1:15:08] serving breakfast lunch supper together
[1:15:11] uh
[1:15:14] beginning with Friday night
[1:15:16] Saturday and Sunday the whole day
[1:15:21] you know if you come just plan prepare
[1:15:24] to live on Monday morning
[1:15:28] and then those who will just come to
[1:15:30] attend the services here they will pay
[1:15:32] 10 000.
[1:15:37] and that will be meant to also support a
[1:15:39] little on the food
[1:15:42] the lunch that will be served those days
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:49] so I spoke to brother Robert and this
[1:15:51] morning I think yes and he told me that
[1:15:54] he has already announced and he's going
[1:15:57] to announce and encourage his young
[1:15:58] people to come
[1:16:01] Lifeboat
[1:16:19] okay what about my way of streaming
[1:16:23] okay so I say that many of you streamed
[1:16:27] so I was thinking you will have a double
[1:16:29] portion
[1:16:38] before we go to the world I just wanted
[1:16:41] to let you know that we've passed out a
[1:16:43] budget
[1:16:51] no dollar
[1:16:55] um trying to pull it up here brother
[1:16:56] Isaac
[1:16:58] another amount organization
[1:17:05] okay now this yes I've found it this is
[1:17:08] a all that is going to be needed
[1:17:11] for just the food and accommodation
[1:17:20] we will need a total of about 14
[1:17:22] Millions but for the food and
[1:17:24] accommodation
[1:17:25] um we will need 7.4
[1:17:34] yeah
[1:17:36] so we've been already contributing
[1:17:39] probably on Wednesday we contributed
[1:17:42] brother Andrew how much was contributed
[1:17:47] do you have an amount
[1:18:01] she's also pledging so you have to write
[1:18:04] that down
[1:18:06] she's pledging a hundred kilograms of
[1:18:09] rice
[1:18:12] so and and we need 160 kilograms
[1:18:19] with rice we are remaining only with 60.
[1:18:24] yes and uh she has also said she will
[1:18:28] also pledge all the onions again foreign
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:52] [Music]
[1:19:11] again
[1:19:13] I believe we should be able to take care
[1:19:15] of them and take care of ourselves
[1:19:22] that was just what I meant I mean
[1:19:27] do we believe that
[1:19:29] we are a younger generation
[1:19:32] and you know what I believe that we
[1:19:35] should own
[1:19:37] uh our meetings
[1:19:42] and we should support them
[1:19:45] we should support our Ministries
[1:19:49] with our own substance
[1:19:51] there is a blessing in doing that
[1:19:56] so to you who is receiving it
[1:19:59] I'm sure you'll receive a blessings
[1:20:03] amen amen so while we stand at three
[1:20:07] minutes I'd like also to let you know
[1:20:09] that uh after this service we shall have
[1:20:11] a business meeting
[1:20:13] services
[1:20:17] so to those of you who have been
[1:20:19] attending the fellowship here the past
[1:20:21] year

[1:20:27] offerings
[1:20:29] you've given on the church uh land fund
[1:20:32] we are collecting money to buy our own
[1:20:34] land and build today
[1:20:39] we would like to report to you
[1:20:43] how much we have
[1:20:46] how much your money has done
[1:20:50] and everything that goes with that
[1:20:54] it would not be long maybe 30 minutes or
[1:20:57] 40 so please come and just listen to
[1:20:59] them
[1:21:03] but for now for an hour or so I'd like
[1:21:05] us to stand and get into the world
[1:21:11] and see what the Lord has for us this
[1:21:13] morning
[1:21:15] I noticed from
[1:21:17] just during the end of the year
[1:21:21] I had five meetings
[1:21:26] in on the same weekend my weekend DM in
[1:21:29] two different countries
[1:21:31] and I noticed I've not recovered from
[1:21:34] that yet
[1:21:36] pray for me for God to give me strength
[1:21:39] this morning
[1:21:40] are you expecting to hear something from
[1:21:43] him today
[1:21:45] are you expecting
[1:21:47] amen he will speak to you let us pray
[1:21:51] Lord Jesus we want to thank you so much
[1:21:55] this morning
[1:22:00] you know what these people need this
[1:22:26] um
[1:22:27] so we are going to the Book of Psalms
[1:22:35] foreign
[1:22:52] we will read verses 6 to 9.
[1:23:02] and I'm reading in the name of the Lord
[1:23:04] let not them that wait on thee O Lord
[1:23:08] God of hosts be ashamed for my sake let
[1:23:11] not those
[1:23:12] that seek thee be confounded for my sake
[1:23:15] o God of Israel because for thy sake I
[1:23:20] have borne reproach shame has covered my
[1:23:24] face
[1:23:25] I am become a stranger unto my brethren
[1:23:28] and an Aryan and to my mother's children
[1:23:31] for the Zeal of thine house has eaten me
[1:23:36] up and the reproaches of them that
[1:23:39] reproached thee are Fallen upon me
[1:23:42] foreign
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:24:27] I mean you may be seated
[1:24:32] so this morning our subject is bearing
[1:24:35] reproach for Christ
[1:24:41] you know this subject
[1:24:44] I usually love speaking on things that
[1:24:48] are really
[1:24:49] real in our lives
[1:24:54] because then this is what we need to be
[1:24:57] able to grow spiritually
[1:24:59] so this subject of bearing reproach for
[1:25:02] Christ
[1:25:03] is
[1:25:06] a subject that we all deal with in a
[1:25:09] daily
[1:25:12] to wit them if you believed on Jesus
[1:25:15] at one point in your life you will have
[1:25:18] to bear reproach
[1:25:22] you know it's like a man or a woman who
[1:25:25] gets married to a man
[1:25:28] she is going to Bear reproach anything
[1:25:33] to do with this man again
[1:25:38] this man is a good man um
[1:25:42] she will receive the Praises
[1:25:45] but whatever he does
[1:25:47] she's somehow going to be accountable
[1:25:51] you can never be free from the things
[1:25:56] that your husband does
[1:25:59] the life of your husband is a part of
[1:26:02] you and you are part of it
[1:26:06] just like you know brother says that if
[1:26:10] you want to know a man
[1:26:15] look at what he married
[1:26:18] if you know no matter what it says
[1:26:21] the man can even be a preacher
[1:26:24] he may even Sing and Shout
[1:26:27] you know seem to behave so well and be
[1:26:30] so nice
[1:26:31] but it's not what he is or what he says
[1:26:35] he is
[1:26:38] what he says he is is nothing
[1:26:42] you will see his real self
[1:26:47] through the woman he married
[1:26:51] the brothers who are married here can
[1:26:53] you say Amen
[1:26:57] Amina
[1:26:59] brothers who are married are you here
[1:27:05] you know not many brothers want to say
[1:27:07] Amen to that
[1:27:08] food
[1:27:10] is true but my wife has bad behaviors
[1:27:21] whatever way that your wife is
[1:27:27] we know you by your wife
[1:27:32] that's right and in the same way we know
[1:27:37] Jesus by the wife he marries yes
[1:27:41] if you know he marries a sex Queen
[1:27:46] you know then we know that that's how
[1:27:48] Christ is
[1:27:50] so many of those who claim to Believe In
[1:27:52] Christ
[1:27:55] but when you look at their life
[1:27:57] carefully
[1:27:59] that's nothing to do with the character
[1:28:01] nature of Christ
[1:28:04] then we surely know they are not of him
[1:28:08] so in other words your nature and your
[1:28:11] character Community is
[1:28:14] reflect the nature and the character of
[1:28:17] Jesus Christ
[1:28:20] and here now we see David in the Book of
[1:28:23] Psalms
[1:28:25] David was a type of Christ brother says
[1:28:32] are the many things that David said
[1:28:34] Christ said amen
[1:28:37] and you know David was a prophet
[1:28:42] but here he says because for thy sake I
[1:28:45] have borne reproach shame has covered my
[1:28:47] face
[1:28:51] I am become a stranger unto my brethren
[1:28:55] um
[1:28:57] you remember David when he came one day
[1:29:01] and and he was first of all he was the
[1:29:04] harder of sheep
[1:29:05] and how the lion once came to eat sheep
[1:29:09] and he killed that lion
[1:29:12] and then a bear wanted to come and kill
[1:29:15] also the Sheep he killed it
[1:29:18] so David was a man that had experience
[1:29:22] by the things he suffered
[1:29:26] and after many years
[1:29:28] we know that David was anointed to be
[1:29:31] the next king of Israel
[1:30:30] you cannot see anyone defying the word
[1:30:33] which you claim to believe and you said
[1:30:35] nothing
[1:30:39] and you say who am I to judge
[1:30:42] I believe Believers every believer must
[1:30:45] have the Zeal of the lord
[1:30:50] of the house of the Lord should eat us
[1:30:54] amen and David from when he was a little
[1:30:57] boy
[1:31:02] so you know it was none of his business
[1:31:05] he was not a soldier but when he came he
[1:31:10] said but who is this
[1:31:17] you know he would have said please kill
[1:31:20] him
[1:31:22] not for sure if no one is going to go
[1:31:25] again I am going to go if no one is
[1:31:29] going to do anything about it again
[1:31:32] foreign
[1:32:32] you know I'm not just a man cinnamon you
[1:32:35] are looking at me as a little boy
[1:32:37] I'm not just a little boy
[1:32:40] I have an experience with the Lord
[1:32:43] I am a Shepherd yes it was right there
[1:32:47] at my post of Duty
[1:32:50] the Lord was with me
[1:32:53] a lion
[1:33:00] I began to fight with it
[1:33:07] another time
[1:33:17] who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:33:21] give me a chance
[1:33:26] he will show you that I have a living
[1:33:30] and they all said foreign
[1:34:05] hey

[1:34:10] give you a chance
[1:34:11] come here brother
[1:34:20] to give you a chance but little David
[1:34:24] you don't have to wear my jacket
[1:34:29] so you can go and defeat
[1:34:34] foreign
[1:34:45] [Applause]

[1:36:28] himself he
[1:36:33] will never let you be ashamed
[1:36:38] the problem is men and Christians
[1:36:47] but I'll tell you you don't have to pray
[1:36:49] for it
[1:36:51] oh Lord Give Me Your reproach you don't
[1:36:55] need to pray
[1:36:57] as long as you stand with the world

[1:37:04] everywhere you go you're natural where
[1:37:07] you are you're natural with anybody
[1:37:10] you take your way with the world
[1:37:12] the reproach will always
[1:37:16] but if it doesn't come it means you are
[1:37:19] not standing with the world
[1:37:24] and so he says I became a stranger unto
[1:37:26] my brethren
[1:37:28] um
[1:37:29] so he told them let me face him now
[1:37:34] I know you don't all believe me
[1:37:36] but let me first
[1:37:38] they laughed at him he said I don't care
[1:37:43] because I don't mind let me bear this

[2:01:25] sisters don't give your numbers to this
[2:01:28] young man
[2:01:29] foreign
[2:02:29] they should first come to his your

[2:02:34] that's the way we believe it
[2:02:37] come to your pastor first
[2:02:40] if if your intentions are good
[2:02:43] why do you fear to come and tell me I
[2:02:45] want to marry your daughter why why

[2:03:49] because he knows what is his brothers
[2:03:56] and he will come back again
[2:04:02] are you sure
[2:04:03] yes and I also know fortunate is a good
[2:04:06] girl
[2:04:08] for marriage
[2:04:17] I don't attack for her for him
[2:04:21] we don't believe in matchmaking
[2:04:26] there's a brother who told me
[2:04:30] please speak to that sister for me
[2:04:35] and I said brother if I do that it means
[2:04:39] I'm the one now married
[2:04:49] you have to go and throw your
[2:04:51] application yourself
[2:04:53] and when they accept the applications
[2:04:59] and sister when someone comes to you
[2:05:03] before you say anything
[2:05:05] you are number one
[2:05:07] thing to do
[2:05:09] is my pastor aware um
[2:05:15] do you know you can never accept any
[2:05:18] brother until
[2:05:21] your fathers give any permission
[2:05:28] if your father does not give any
[2:05:30] permission
[2:05:31] and you accept and you vow no like
[2:05:35] either that's nothing it's just
[2:05:36] rubbishiro
[2:05:39] because the Bible Bible and the prophet
[2:05:42] says if that father gets to know of it
[2:05:46] is
[2:06:01] be careful again there is this is not a
[2:06:03] joking area
[2:06:05] but the world has come into the church
[2:06:08] we should be not ashamed
[2:06:11] we have been told in this message
[2:06:15] let us not be ashamed of the world
[2:06:20] to the eggs that you find a big boys
[2:06:24] writing little girls
[2:06:27] I love you
[2:06:30] that's the spirit of love this
[2:06:32] is not a speed of marriage
[2:06:39] and we are days of the voice should not
[2:06:42] entertain it in a finger days of The
[2:06:45] Voice
[2:06:46] [Applause]
[2:06:48] and we should not be ashamed of our
[2:06:51] stance
[2:06:53] we should stand with what the message
[2:06:55] says
[2:06:57] because if you stand with the message
[2:06:59] you can never be wrong
[2:07:02] if you bear the reproach for Christ
[2:07:07] there is a victory waiting
[2:07:12] God still asks people
[2:07:15] and our generation
[2:07:23] both men and women
[2:07:28] and I can speak that on Authority
[2:07:30] because I am one of them
[2:07:33] as far as the word is concerned
[2:07:36] I'm still a virgin today
[2:07:44] sometimes
[2:07:46] all right I'll not go there but you know
[2:07:50] boys
[2:07:54] immaturity
[2:08:03] foreign
[2:08:12] [Music]
[2:09:25] you know I have a friend of mine by the
[2:09:27] power
[2:09:29] he started uh uh political science or
[2:09:33] something like that yes
[2:09:35] and so he works with big organizations
[2:09:39] and so sometimes they uh receive
[2:09:42] opportunities of going for trips
[2:09:47] and it's been to Europe
[2:09:52] so one day he was on the plane and he
[2:09:57] was giving me his testimony
[2:09:59] and that was sad I think it was uh
[2:10:03] some Swiss Airlines or something like
[2:10:04] that
[2:10:05] or something yeah so then
[2:10:10] what would you like
[2:10:15] the everything they mentioned
[2:10:18] there was no soda
[2:10:20] there was no water
[2:10:27] it was beverages
[2:10:34] and
[2:10:36] he runs through the list
[2:10:39] and he told me I thought to myself
[2:10:43] I used to be a heavy drunkard
[2:10:46] I used to take Banks but the Lord
[2:10:49] delivered me
[2:10:51] and saved me I'm not going to go back
[2:10:56] this is a man who used to take all these
[2:10:58] drugs and you had dreadlocks and he was
[2:11:00] sleeping on the roads he was going for
[2:11:02] the cat like how many times
[2:11:10] but the Lord delivered him and he
[2:11:12] started a society or an organization of
[2:11:15] soba he called it sober life
[2:11:24] not to go in that lifestyle
[2:11:28] and so here he is presented with another
[2:11:31] opportunity
[2:11:34] to take a little beverage
[2:11:38] is
[2:11:44] all by himself
[2:11:48] foreign
[2:12:02] of the Gospel put it he took the refresh
[2:12:06] the woman looked at him
[2:12:10] confused
[2:12:16] maybe he has never taken this kind of
[2:12:19] things
[2:12:27] and then they were going as a team
[2:12:31] on his team from Kenya
[2:12:34] Kenya he was only a team of two
[2:12:39] the other was a little girl um
[2:12:46] and saw the book for them in a very
[2:12:48] expensive I think whatever Hotel
[2:12:52] one of the expensive cities
[2:12:55] and so he told me he said
[2:13:00] um
[2:13:03] there is when you know you are saved or
[2:13:05] not
[2:13:11] and these days I don't know what women

[2:14:03] she gave him a distance and she
[2:14:07] respected him like nothing
[2:14:11] foreign
[2:14:32] and one day
[2:14:34] I was on one of the mission trips
[2:14:38] and I was going through Tanzania
[2:14:46] and I was going by bus
[2:14:48] because it was late I had to take a
[2:14:53] night into a place
[2:14:55] and so the place was very cold
[2:14:59] being that it was near the sea company
[2:15:02] and so I was in there but really feeling
[2:15:06] so cold
[2:15:08] and I was not yet married
[2:15:10] I was a young boy
[2:15:13] already on the mission work
[2:15:15] that was like 17 or something like that
[2:15:18] wow and so this man comes in my guide
[2:15:23] um
[2:15:32] foreign
[2:15:55] [Music]
[2:16:32] and the anger of the Lord came upon him
[2:16:35] and I told this man wow
[2:16:41] immediately
[2:16:51] you were shaking and moved
[2:16:54] and and said
[2:16:57] I did not know I'm so sorry you are
[2:17:01] interpreter supposed to interpret these
[2:17:02] things and he said I'm sorry
[2:17:07] but for about one hour um I lied on my
[2:17:11] bed thinking
[2:17:13] nobody was here to see me
[2:17:16] Peppa
[2:17:18] no one not my parents not my father
[2:17:23] my brothers
[2:17:25] my friends no one okay so I was not
[2:17:29] going to ask him the name of Christ
[2:17:31] because
[2:17:34] the Angels were there
[2:17:37] the angels of God are always encamping
[2:17:39] around those who fear the names
[2:17:45] you are going to be presented with that
[2:17:47] rare opportunity one day
[2:17:51] every day foreign
[2:17:59] this is a challenge
[2:18:01] are you hearing me friends this is a
[2:18:04] challenge
[2:18:17] oh are you going to ashame the name of
[2:18:19] Christ
[2:18:22] I wonder
[2:18:24] what you are going to do
[2:18:29] let's take a moment to think about it
[2:18:37] bearing reproach for Christ
[2:18:42] I promised you I would be one hour once
[2:18:44] I have three minutes to go I'll just
[2:18:48] starting
[2:18:50] but it's good to keep it's good to keep
[2:18:52] your word as a Christian nature
[2:19:01] in the message the reproach for the
[2:19:03] cause of the word and I'd like you to
[2:19:04] take this message each of you and listen
[2:19:06] to it or read it
[2:19:09] is
[2:19:13] God has a time
[2:19:16] and the reason for that time
[2:19:20] to fulfill all his Works
[2:19:24] God knows just exactly what he's going
[2:19:27] to do
[2:19:28] again we don't for that woman we just
[2:19:32] have to receive it as he gives it to us
[2:19:35] but he knows and there is nothing going
[2:19:40] to go wrong with what he has planned to
[2:19:43] do
[2:19:47] it has all have to come about
[2:19:53] he called you for a purpose
[2:19:56] oh yes I'm convinced
[2:20:01] he called me for a puppy and Peter
[2:20:03] originated he called you for a Papa he
[2:20:06] agreed already he would have been born
[2:20:08] in a believer's home
[2:20:10] you might have been born in a believer's
[2:20:12] home
[2:20:14] and that way you had that message
[2:20:22] the message I might have found you
[2:20:24] somewhere
[2:20:26] there is a purpose
[2:20:30] foreign
[2:20:47] when I was 15 years
[2:20:50] I thought God had destroyed my life
[2:20:56] I was first here with a bright future
[2:21:00] energy

[2:21:13] they were driving me to school
[2:21:16] very young but I had everything I wish

[2:21:46] me though

[2:22:48] but you see it is a mystery of his wings

[2:47:17] because it was built upon the road
[2:47:26] they knew it was a father as a foolish
[2:47:28] man
[2:47:30] it is only the wise to get saved
[2:47:34] thanks be to God that we have made this
[2:47:37] the wise men and women
