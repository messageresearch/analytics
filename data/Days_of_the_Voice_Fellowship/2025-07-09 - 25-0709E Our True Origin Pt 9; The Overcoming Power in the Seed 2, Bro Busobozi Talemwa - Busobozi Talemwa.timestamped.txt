[40:25] So I'm speaking on overcoming power in
[40:28] the seed
[40:31] and this is um a part a part two
[40:36] on this uh subject.
[40:39] We're dealing with a series of our true
[40:40] origin.
[40:44] And there's quite a lot that we can get
[40:46] into
[40:48] and just pray for me tonight that
[40:51] whatever I share will be a blessing to
[40:52] us.
[40:54] Amen. And so I just wanted to get um uh
[40:57] the the phrase there where he says and
[40:59] none of them is lost.
[41:02] [Music]
[41:05] He was with us in the world
[41:08] and he says I kept them in thy name.
[41:12] We know what that name of the father is
[41:15] in the Lord Jesus Christ. He kept us in
[41:18] his name, the father's name.
[41:21] That those that you gave me, I have
[41:23] kept.
[41:25] So those that he that God gave him.
[41:28] How did he give them to him? Because
[41:31] they were in the mind of God before the
[41:32] foundation of the world.
[41:35] And he says, none of them is lost.
[41:38] If you notice, he's speaking in past
[41:40] tense.
[41:44] So you are not being found now.
[41:47] You were found then.
[41:49] You see? So you were not lost.
[41:52] You already born when you are found
[41:57] according to the words of Jesus.
[42:00] Why? The only reason why he can say that
[42:03] because he understands that the power to
[42:05] overcome the world is in the seed.
[42:13] And you know and then he says none of
[42:15] them is lost.
[42:18] But then he says only the son of
[42:19] pedition.
[42:21] And so who is the son of pedition?
[42:24] Well, of course, you know, these words
[42:26] he's speaking also he's um uh you can
[42:30] look at the prayer for the disciples.
[42:34] We know that you can say it was a prayer
[42:36] for the disciples.
[42:39] But you see the disciples were 12
[42:42] and the 11 of them were good.
[42:46] They were seed and one of them was not
[42:49] one of them was serpent seed and that is
[42:52] Judas. So now when when Jesus is praying
[42:57] he's saying none of them is lost
[43:01] and all that you have given me I have
[43:02] kept them
[43:04] and none of them is lost but the son of
[43:07] pedition. So now he he says Judas
[43:11] the only lost one. So who chose Judas?
[43:17] Well Judas was one of the 12 disciples.
[43:20] They came and they were in the church
[43:23] and and you know when Jesus taught Judas
[43:25] was there
[43:28] when others left Judas never left.
[43:31] Judas was always among the group
[43:35] but you know he left right in the last
[43:37] last minute
[43:40] you know in the message three kinds of
[43:42] believers.
[43:44] You know I was actually reading a
[43:46] portion of it today
[43:48] that you know three kinds of believers.
[43:51] There is the genuine believer
[43:54] that one will always believe the word no
[43:56] matter what.
[43:59] No matter what has happened in the
[44:00] church, no matter what has happened to a
[44:03] brother, no matter what has happened to
[44:05] a sister
[44:07] really care because the reason why they
[44:10] came to church
[44:12] was not to see other people's failures.
[44:15] but was to see Christ
[44:18] in the word. And so their hearts are
[44:22] always focused on the word
[44:25] that is the genuine believer.
[44:27] And then you have the non-believer,
[44:31] the nonbeliever will come in. And the
[44:34] moment he says something that is, you
[44:36] know, off a little bit off of what he
[44:38] thinks,
[44:40] he would say, "You are judging him." And
[44:43] then he will walk away. That's the
[44:45] nonbeliever.
[44:46] But you see, brother Bam then reaches on
[44:48] the third one.
[44:50] The make believer,
[44:53] he says, "That's the boy.
[44:56] That's the boy.
[44:58] that one will stay for a real long time.
[45:02] He can stay for a while. But then he
[45:05] gives a few characteristics about him.
[45:08] And then he says this make believer.
[45:11] He will always two things about him that
[45:13] is amaz
[45:22] when he looks at others
[45:24] his um his his concern will be to find
[45:28] fault
[45:34] and they will always be offended.
[45:38] They will always be offender.
[45:41] And they will always know whatever is
[45:43] going wrong in every home.
[45:46] They will always know what is wrong in
[45:48] the church. They are the ones know who
[45:50] know what is was not done right.
[45:53] That is one of the characters
[45:56] of a make believe. And then he says the
[45:58] second character of a make believer
[46:02] they will always have their hand out for
[46:04] money.
[46:08] They they always want money.
[46:11] is always about money with them.
[46:13] Whatever they do, there are people of
[46:15] deals.
[46:17] You know, they always want money
[46:19] somewhere. And you see, brother Bam
[46:21] explains it and then he it culminates
[46:24] all under one man, Judas.
[46:28] And then he said that's how Judas was.
[46:31] He was he was always having his hand out
[46:34] for money.
[46:36] He he always was picking on on what was
[46:38] wrong and
[46:41] you know and and you know I think it was
[46:43] among those who said why don't we it's
[46:46] not right for this woman to do this why
[46:47] don't we sell this oil and we give money
[46:49] to her
[46:53] you understand so that's a make believe
[46:56] and that is not a seed of God
[47:00] that is serpent seed
[47:03] but the seed of God will always never be
[47:06] lost.
[47:08] The seed of God can never be lost.
[47:12] The seed of God is only focused on the
[47:14] world.
[47:16] He doesn't care what has gone around.
[47:21] They will stick with Christ. They will
[47:23] stick with the word.
[47:26] You've seen people many times who get
[47:28] offended and walk away
[47:30] because so and so offended them and then
[47:33] they put it on the whole church
[47:36] and then they say, "Oh, the church is
[47:38] bad." But the real genuine believer
[47:42] stick with the word no matter what
[47:43] happens.
[47:46] Amen. And I already preached about that
[47:47] some time back. But here now, Jesus
[47:51] speaks of the ones that God had given
[47:54] him.
[47:56] And he begins and he tells them I have
[47:58] prayed for you. And he says, none of
[48:01] them is lost.
[48:03] Who are these? These are the genuine
[48:06] seed.
[48:09] Why can they not be lost? Because the
[48:11] seed of God
[48:13] remains in them.
[48:16] Amen. Second Timothy 2 19
[48:21] says, "Nevertheless,
[48:23] the foundation of God standeth sure.
[48:28] Having this seal,
[48:31] the Lord knoweth them that are his
[48:36] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[48:38] Christ depart from iniquity."
[48:44] The the seal is
[48:46] the Lord knows them that are his.
[48:50] Amen. You know, God is not confused.
[48:56] When he called the 12, he knew who
[48:58] everybody was. And he said, "I didn't
[49:01] call 12 of you
[49:04] and one of them a devil."
[49:06] And he actually knew who a devil was.
[49:09] He actually knew who the serpent seed
[49:11] was,
[49:13] but he never did blame anybody or
[49:15] condemn anybody
[49:17] because he came not to condemn,
[49:21] but he came to save. And even the gospel
[49:24] we are preaching today, it's not a
[49:26] gospel to condemn. It's a gospel to
[49:29] save. Sometimes preachers think when you
[49:32] condemn people,
[49:34] you will yield good believers.
[49:37] That has never worked. Jesus never used
[49:40] that method.
[49:42] No disciple used that method.
[49:45] But what was the method Jesus used?
[49:48] He went ahead to preach the word. Preach
[49:51] the word. Preach the word. Preach the
[49:53] word.
[49:55] Because there is a principle.
[49:58] There is a principle. God knows them
[50:00] that are his.
[50:03] So what are you going to do? He knows
[50:05] the wheat.
[50:07] He knows the wheat. He knows the tears
[50:10] and the wheat.
[50:12] So the only thing he had to do was to
[50:15] bring down the rain.
[50:18] When the rain of the word comes down and
[50:21] the rain of the Holy Ghost comes down,
[50:23] those two seed plants will mature.
[50:28] So there is a time of maturity.
[50:31] Overcoming power
[50:33] is not in the rain that come.
[50:37] You see the rain falls on the bad and
[50:39] the good.
[50:41] The rain falls on the just and the
[50:43] unjust.
[50:45] But you see the power that overcome
[50:49] the power that brings forth fruit
[50:52] is already in the seed.
[50:56] The seed which went in the ground.
[50:59] So as long as you create the right
[51:02] atmosphere for the sle,
[51:06] amen, the life will come out. They will
[51:09] overcome.
[51:11] Amen. But also the other tear,
[51:15] the other fruit's vine will also come to
[51:18] maturity.
[51:20] Amen. Hallelujah. I want you to see
[51:24] there was a a Judas and there was a
[51:27] Peter. Both of them had the word. Both
[51:31] of them walked with Jesus. When Jesus
[51:33] said, "One of you will betray me," both
[51:36] of them said, "No." When Jesus said,
[51:40] "One of you will leave me." All of you
[51:42] will leave me, all of them said no. When
[51:45] he said you will deny me, all of them
[51:48] said no. Why? They were still young.
[51:51] They had not yet come to maturity.
[51:54] But remember that word will always bring
[51:58] the seed to maturity.
[52:02] Amen. And time came when we had to
[52:04] separate the girls from the boys.
[52:08] Amen. The moment of persecution,
[52:11] the moment of pressure, the moment of
[52:13] the squeeze
[52:15] when they arrested Jesus and took him to
[52:18] be killed. Everybody despised
[52:22] including Peter who said,
[52:25] I will die with you. Where you go, I
[52:27] will go. He also escaped. And he was on
[52:31] the side. And as a little child came and
[52:34] told him, you are one of them. He denied
[52:37] Jesus. He said, "No, I'm not one of them
[52:40] to the extent that he even cast.
[52:44] He spoke like an unbeliever
[52:47] so that they can believe he's an
[52:48] unbeliever."
[52:51] But he was a genuine believer.
[52:54] A a genuine believer will make mistakes
[52:56] as a a sinner
[53:03] in the process of growth.
[53:06] But the difference is the difference is
[53:10] God knows them that are his
[53:13] and none of them will be lost.
[53:18] As long as you sit under the word,
[53:21] the word will mature you.
[53:25] The word will mature you.
[53:27] And here comes Peter
[53:29] rejecting and cursing the words.
[53:33] But something happened.
[53:35] You know some when he had a cockro
[53:41] something happened to him.
[53:43] Something small to him. He remembered
[53:46] the word.
[53:48] What matured him? The word.
[53:50] As long as you are hearing the word,
[53:53] it's a seed of God into your heart.
[53:57] You may not see or feel it working.
[54:01] That seed has been planted.
[54:03] If you are the seed of God, I tell you,
[54:06] you can never be lost.
[54:09] Why? Because that seed
[54:12] remains in you.
[54:14] And then when you remembered
[54:17] quickly went into a corner and he began
[54:20] praying and confessing his sin and
[54:22] repenting and hallelujah and God forgave
[54:26] him. Are you not so glad friends? We
[54:30] have a bleach.
[54:32] Amen. Of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[54:35] Amen. that goes and washes and cleanses
[54:37] us
[54:39] and makes us white as snow.
[54:42] When our tempter comes
[54:45] to condemn us, he finds nothing.
[54:49] Even God can find nothing
[54:52] because we have gone through the bleach
[54:54] of the blood
[54:56] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And so
[55:00] right there, God forgave you.
[55:02] But in the same same time, Another man,
[55:06] Judas,
[55:08] he went and betrayed Jesus
[55:12] because of the money.
[55:15] And then and and then you know he said,
[55:16] "Give me 30 pieces of silver
[55:19] and he took the money." And after
[55:21] betraying Jesus, he realized he had
[55:24] indeed did a bad thing,
[55:28] he did the first step of repentance,
[55:32] but he could not come through with it.
[55:36] Why? Because there was no seed in him.
[55:41] He went and tried to give back the
[55:42] money.
[55:44] When they rejected the money,
[55:47] he could not have the revelation
[55:51] that no sin cannot be forgiven.
[55:53] Hallelujah.
[55:56] He could not have the revelation
[55:59] that God amen still sent Jesus Christ
[56:04] and he can forgive every sin.
[56:08] In other words, Judas could not bring
[56:11] you know himself to a place of
[56:12] forgiveness.
[56:16] He could not forgive himself.
[56:20] That's why he committed suicide. And
[56:23] there are many people who commit suicide
[56:24] themselves
[56:26] because they have lost hope.
[56:28] But a believer always has hope.
[56:31] A believer never gives up. No matter
[56:34] what has happened,
[56:36] a believer never gives. I believe keeps
[56:38] moving.
[56:41] Hallelujah. And this brother could not
[56:43] forgive himself and he took his life.
[56:48] Both seeds came to maturity.
[56:53] The same word, the same rain matured
[56:57] them and both went to eat their place.
[57:04] Oh my my what a revelation for this.
[57:07] And so we see that brother Bam talked
[57:09] about the two vines
[57:12] And we'll begin reading out of the
[57:14] regime of the ages.
[57:20] He says, "From our studies, we have
[57:21] already learned that much of the
[57:23] revelation is totally misunderstood
[57:24] because we have not formally known that
[57:26] the church spoken of and spoken to in
[57:29] this book does not refer to the pure
[57:32] ecclesia,
[57:35] the elect, the body of Christ, the
[57:37] bride. But it is speaking to the entire
[57:40] body of the people who are called
[57:42] Christians, whether they be true or
[57:45] merely nominal."
[57:46] Amen. Now here uh he's talking about the
[57:50] book of revelation.
[57:52] It is not mainly when he says to the
[57:54] church
[57:56] to the church to the church. He's not
[57:58] speaking to only the bride.
[58:00] He's not speaking to the body of Christ
[58:02] only.
[58:04] He's not speaking only to the elect.
[58:07] He's speaking to all the people called
[58:09] Christians.
[58:11] Some of them are just nominal
[58:13] Christians.
[58:15] Christian
[58:18] and others are true Christians.
[58:21] As all Israel is not Israel,
[58:25] all Christians are not Israel.
[58:29] Thus, we learned that the church is made
[58:31] up of two vines.
[58:34] The true and the false. The two vines
[58:38] are motivated by two kinds of spirits.
[58:44] One has the Holy Spirit
[58:48] while the other is endued with the
[58:50] spirit of antichrist.
[58:55] But both to know and be known of God.
[59:01] Both claim to speak for God.
[59:05] Both believe certain very basic truth
[59:07] and defer on others.
[59:12] But since both bear the name of the
[59:15] Lord,
[59:18] being called Christians
[59:20] and by such name bearing obviously claim
[59:24] a relationship to God.
[59:31] God now holds them both responsible to
[59:33] him
[59:37] and he therefore speaks to both of them.
[59:41] So that's why in in a church he never
[59:45] separates this and that
[59:48] even now when the word is coming
[59:51] is the same word that comes to a
[59:53] believer
[59:54] will come to an unbeliever.
[59:57] The same word which comes to a seed of
[59:59] God
[1:00:01] will come to a serpent seed.
[1:00:04] The same Bible the message believers use
[1:00:07] is the same Bible the nominal Christians
[1:00:09] use.
[1:00:11] The same scriptures we read
[1:00:14] they read.
[1:00:16] So you have to understand sometimes when
[1:00:19] I put on some other nominal preachers
[1:00:23] when I I switch it on maybe on YouTube
[1:00:25] or something.
[1:00:28] Sometimes my wife listens to what I'm
[1:00:30] listening to.
[1:00:34] Is that a believable message?
[1:00:36] I said, "No,
[1:00:39] he's speaking the word." Well, if you
[1:00:41] listen to them, they are speaking the
[1:00:44] same word.
[1:00:46] They may not have the revelation we have
[1:00:47] on some things.
[1:00:52] It's not a different Bible.
[1:00:55] If you go to Anglican church, they are
[1:00:58] reading the same Bible.
[1:01:00] If you go to Pentecost or wherever, they
[1:01:02] reading the same Bible. So the same word
[1:01:06] and Christ is actually out of that word.
[1:01:11] Out of that word, he's speaking to both.
[1:01:16] He's speaking to the genuine believers
[1:01:19] and to the make believers. So whenever
[1:01:22] you hear the word, who are you? Are you
[1:01:25] the spirit of God or you are serpent
[1:01:28] seed?
[1:01:29] according to the seed in you.
[1:01:32] That's how you receive the word.
[1:01:37] That's why the word in itself
[1:01:41] cannot change a sinner.
[1:01:45] The word in itself
[1:01:48] cannot give power to a sinner to change
[1:01:50] his way.
[1:01:54] The word in itself is not overcoming
[1:01:56] power.
[1:01:58] Or else Cain would have overcome.
[1:02:02] Also the unbelievers that hear the word
[1:02:04] would have received Christ.
[1:02:09] True genuine overcoming power
[1:02:12] is in the seed.
[1:02:15] The seed that is in you.
[1:02:18] When the word of God comes
[1:02:20] with such power and intensity,
[1:02:24] you know, it quickens the seed.
[1:02:27] that is already in you.
[1:02:30] If that seed is not in you,
[1:02:33] a preacher may preach. He may hit your
[1:02:36] head. Nothing will happen.
[1:02:39] Where you may say is the pre the problem
[1:02:41] is a picture.
[1:02:43] We bring another preacher. Nothing will
[1:02:46] happen. You will say the problem is that
[1:02:48] preacher. We bring another preacher.
[1:02:51] Nothing will happen.
[1:02:53] So brother, sister, if you are the seed
[1:02:56] of God, you open your heart to the word
[1:03:01] regardless of the vessel.
[1:03:04] It's all about the word.
[1:03:07] The word will bring the result
[1:03:10] out of a genuine believer.
[1:03:15] Amen. You know would say doesn't matter
[1:03:18] if it is the word is the word no matter
[1:03:19] who is speaking.
[1:03:24] That's why brother Bham respected
[1:03:28] all men of God.
[1:03:32] And that's why we also should respect
[1:03:36] servants of God. It doesn't matter who
[1:03:39] they are. It doesn't matter which group
[1:03:41] they talking
[1:03:44] the word. It will bring forth of its
[1:03:46] kind.
[1:03:48] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:03:51] we father land that these and I'm still
[1:03:54] continuing to quote out of them
[1:03:57] that these two vines
[1:03:59] would grow side by side
[1:04:04] until the end of the age
[1:04:08] when both would come to maturity and
[1:04:09] both be harvested
[1:04:14] the two vines. I remember what apostle
[1:04:17] Paul said
[1:04:18] that it doesn't matter how the word is
[1:04:21] preached.
[1:04:23] Some preach it out of contention
[1:04:26] and others preach but in the same way
[1:04:28] Christ has preached.
[1:04:31] So to him it didn't even matter who was
[1:04:32] preaching.
[1:04:35] He remember the others who were
[1:04:36] preaching and the disciples said ah
[1:04:38] master
[1:04:41] because they are not a part of our
[1:04:43] church.
[1:04:45] They are not. Should we stop there? He
[1:04:48] said, "No, no, no, no.
[1:04:51] If they are not against us, they are for
[1:04:53] us." If someone has a Bible and is
[1:04:57] claiming to preach my God,
[1:05:00] my
[1:05:03] Christ, I have no problem with. And I
[1:05:07] will honor them. I will respect them. It
[1:05:11] doesn't matter which group they belong.
[1:05:14] This is the message of the hour.
[1:05:16] That's why message believers, we must
[1:05:18] learn to respect every preacher of the
[1:05:21] gospel.
[1:05:26] It doesn't matter who they whe they are
[1:05:27] part of your group or not.
[1:05:31] Why? Because it's not who is speaking
[1:05:34] the word.
[1:05:36] It is what they are saying. Hallelujah.
[1:05:41] The bride loves the word.
[1:05:43] If I hear a Catholic priest saying it,
[1:05:47] I will say amen. If it is the word, who
[1:05:51] told brother Brham, don't worry my son,
[1:05:55] you will know what happened and God will
[1:05:56] reveal it to you.
[1:05:59] It was a prophecy given to brother Brham
[1:06:03] in the church by a Catholic priest.
[1:06:08] And God revealed to brother Brana
[1:06:11] what happened the way the Catholic
[1:06:14] priest prophesied
[1:06:17] because two pages were stuck together.
[1:06:20] And when he landed later on
[1:06:23] and you know of course the Catholic
[1:06:25] priest brought his Bible
[1:06:27] and he told him read from my Bible
[1:06:30] don't worry my son what has happened you
[1:06:33] know it and God will reveal it to you.
[1:06:37] And later on, brother Bam preached a
[1:06:39] sermon this day. Is this scripture
[1:06:42] fulfilled? Why? Because he he he
[1:06:46] remembered he saw what had happened
[1:06:49] and they thought, "Oh my god." Amen. And
[1:06:51] he went back in the days of Jesus.
[1:06:54] You know when they they delivered unto
[1:06:57] him the book of the prophet Isaiah
[1:07:00] and he went to the place where it was
[1:07:02] written
[1:07:04] you know the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:07:05] me. He has anointed me to open the
[1:07:09] prison to those who are bound and Jesus
[1:07:11] closed the book and he said this day is
[1:07:15] this scripture for you.
[1:07:17] And this Catholic priest
[1:07:20] did not actually know.
[1:07:23] Amen. He was living in a time
[1:07:27] when St. Luke 17:30 was actually getting
[1:07:30] fulfilled.
[1:07:33] And the prophet preached a sermon by
[1:07:36] revelation this day. This scripture is
[1:07:39] fulfilled.
[1:07:41] It doesn't matter who the preacher is
[1:07:44] because the anointing of God,
[1:07:46] the spirit of God fall on the just and
[1:07:49] the unjust.
[1:07:52] So it's the word
[1:07:54] the seed in you.
[1:08:00] Oh may God reveal it to us.
[1:08:03] So you see the false vine would not
[1:08:05] overcome
[1:08:08] and the false vine would not overcome
[1:08:14] and destroy the true vine
[1:08:19] because the purpose of the first vine
[1:08:22] would always been to destroy the true
[1:08:24] vine.
[1:08:26] The purpose of the mega believer
[1:08:29] has always been to destroy the believer.
[1:08:33] But we have a prophecy here.
[1:08:36] The first vine will never destroy the
[1:08:39] true vine.
[1:08:41] That is a prophetic.
[1:08:43] Never destroy the true vine.
[1:08:46] In other words, you cannot be destroyed
[1:08:52] if you are the true vine.
[1:08:56] Amen. And here's another one.
[1:08:58] Neither would a true vine
[1:09:01] be able to bring the false vine into a
[1:09:05] saving relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1:09:15] We believe we have the true message
[1:09:19] and this message has power.
[1:09:21] You have heard me say it many times. And
[1:09:24] no matter how powerful the message is,
[1:09:27] We with the message can never be able to
[1:09:31] bring a saving relationship with Jesus
[1:09:34] Christ to a false vine.
[1:09:46] They are not for this message. They are
[1:09:48] not for this message.
[1:09:51] If they will never see it, they will
[1:09:52] never see it.
[1:09:54] It's not about the church. It's not
[1:09:57] about the preacher. It's not about the
[1:10:00] minister. It's about the city.
[1:10:05] Hallelujah. In the very first church,
[1:10:08] the pastor who was preaching in that
[1:10:10] church
[1:10:12] was not a man. was God himself.
[1:10:17] He came and he preached the word. But
[1:10:20] still Kane did not believe
[1:10:24] God himself. You would think that
[1:10:26] someone would hear the voice of God
[1:10:28] would believe.
[1:10:31] But they did not believe.
[1:10:34] Why? Because the condition was in the
[1:10:36] heart.
[1:10:38] There was a seed problem.
[1:10:42] He cannot overcome.
[1:10:45] That's why when when the the Lazarus
[1:10:47] died
[1:10:49] and this man pleaded
[1:10:52] let Lazarus go
[1:10:54] and preach to my people
[1:10:57] and tell them hell is real. Heaven is
[1:11:01] real. Let them repent. When they see
[1:11:04] someone from hell from the dead, they'll
[1:11:08] believe. But what did Abraham say?
[1:11:12] He said no it is not possible on earth
[1:11:17] they are preachers.
[1:11:19] Amen. If your people hear them
[1:11:23] they will not come to hell. In other
[1:11:25] words it's not about who is preaching.
[1:11:30] If someone refuses to believe what I'm
[1:11:32] preaching now,
[1:11:35] even if their brother, uncle, daddy, or
[1:11:37] mother comes from the dead
[1:11:40] and preaches to them the same thing. If
[1:11:43] they don't have a seed of God, they can
[1:11:46] never receive it.
[1:11:50] It's not about the preacher.
[1:11:52] It's about the seed.
[1:11:56] Amen. And you know what? There is
[1:11:59] nothing you can do about it.
[1:12:02] You are either seed or you are not.
[1:12:05] You are either in the mind of go of of
[1:12:07] of God or you are not.
[1:12:10] So the only way you can know is by the
[1:12:16] fruit.
[1:12:18] You shall know them by
[1:12:21] fruit.
[1:12:23] Hallelujah. And when is the fruit se?
[1:12:27] The fruit is seen in the harvest time.
[1:12:31] The field is seen in the end time.
[1:12:35] And we are living in the end time.
[1:12:38] We are living in the evening time.
[1:12:41] When the world is coming to an end,
[1:12:44] when the rapture is about to happen,
[1:12:47] if you are meant to believe this word
[1:12:51] or whether you are enjoying the
[1:12:52] revelation of the word
[1:12:55] or whether you are walking into the life
[1:12:57] of the word,
[1:13:00] you are waiting for the coming of the
[1:13:01] world.
[1:13:03] You are waiting for the change of your
[1:13:05] body.
[1:13:07] Hallelujah.
[1:13:09] Amen.
[1:13:11] And I continue. He says, "We learned the
[1:13:12] most amazing truth
[1:13:16] that the Holy Spirit could
[1:13:18] and would fall upon the ungenerated
[1:13:22] false vine Christians
[1:13:32] and manifest
[1:13:34] powerfully
[1:13:38] in various signs. and wonders.
[1:13:42] There are some people who say that what
[1:13:45] what you know this man of God who came
[1:13:47] to Uganda recently what he was doing is
[1:13:49] false.
[1:13:53] I hope there's no believer who has that
[1:13:54] narrative.
[1:13:57] You know, talk about the anointing of on
[1:14:00] your flesh or spirit.
[1:14:03] These things are real
[1:14:06] is the power of God.
[1:14:09] There's a brother, I forget his name
[1:14:11] now.
[1:14:12] Uh if I remember, I'll tell you.
[1:14:16] He went over to to testify at brother
[1:14:20] brother Biscal's church in Canada.
[1:14:22] His name is Richard Milligan.
[1:14:26] Go and check it out. I don't know if
[1:14:28] it's on YouTube, but probably you could
[1:14:29] find it. Richard Milligan testimony. He
[1:14:32] used to be an assistant
[1:14:35] assistant
[1:14:37] in Benin crusades.
[1:14:39] And so he he testifies everything that
[1:14:42] used to happen and
[1:14:44] first time he encountered the anointing
[1:14:46] of God and how God started using him
[1:14:50] all these things and and but you know he
[1:14:53] says when the revelation of this message
[1:14:56] hit
[1:14:58] nothing was more important
[1:15:01] and and you know so friends it doesn't
[1:15:04] really matter the anointing the Holy
[1:15:06] Spirit will fall upon
[1:15:08] you know vine
[1:15:12] and he says he will manifest powerfully
[1:15:17] in various signs
[1:15:19] and wonders
[1:15:21] even as Judas had a definite ministry
[1:15:28] in the Holy Ghost. Do you believe that
[1:15:31] Judas actually had a ministry in the
[1:15:32] Holy Ghost?
[1:15:35] He cast out demons.
[1:15:37] Do you know actually
[1:15:40] he demons went out crying and
[1:15:43] he was anointed and and he was sent by
[1:15:46] God
[1:15:49] but he himself
[1:15:52] was pronounced to be a devil.
[1:15:58] With these principles in mind,
[1:16:02] we start to trace the church
[1:16:06] through the various seven ages. Amen.
[1:16:11] So how do you identify that church
[1:16:14] through the seven ages?
[1:16:18] You are not looking at how a person the
[1:16:21] mistakes they have done or what they
[1:16:22] have not done.
[1:16:25] Please listen to me church. You are not
[1:16:28] identifying the true seed of God
[1:16:32] by the mistakes they have done,
[1:16:35] the errors, the sins
[1:16:38] or they those things they have not done.
[1:16:43] That doesn't identify the seed.
[1:16:46] You don't identify the seed
[1:16:49] by how much anointing came upon,
[1:16:53] by how much signs and wonders they
[1:16:55] performed. Both
[1:16:58] seeds,
[1:17:00] serpent seed and God sees will do those
[1:17:04] things.
[1:17:06] Am I preaching to someone here? They
[1:17:09] will do miracles, signs and wonders.
[1:17:12] They will do mistakes and errors in
[1:17:13] their life.
[1:17:17] All seeds will manifest those things.
[1:17:20] But there is one thing throughout the
[1:17:24] seven ages.
[1:17:26] that identifies the true seed of God.
[1:17:34] Amen. That when they hear the word,
[1:17:38] they will not debate with it. They will
[1:17:41] not question it, they will believe it
[1:17:44] wholesomely,
[1:17:47] and they will receive it in their words.
[1:17:50] And that word will begin to quicken
[1:17:55] them slowly by slowly slowly by slowly.
[1:18:00] Even as you see me right here, I am
[1:18:03] being quickened.
[1:18:05] You are being quickened. You may not
[1:18:07] feel it. You may not see it. You may not
[1:18:11] hear it. Something on the inside
[1:18:14] is happening in your life.
[1:18:17] The more you hear the word
[1:18:20] quickened
[1:18:22] say walked with God
[1:18:25] was no more
[1:18:27] even it's a walking it's a journey. It
[1:18:32] doesn't happen in a day. It doesn't
[1:18:34] happen in the split of a second. It is a
[1:18:37] journey with with the Holy Ghost. It's a
[1:18:40] journey with the word.
[1:18:42] A holy word.
[1:18:44] The word of God.
[1:18:46] changing me, changing you.
[1:18:51] Oh God, change me.
[1:18:54] Amen. You have to yield yourself
[1:18:57] and tell him, Lord, change me. And you
[1:19:00] know what? The world thinks that
[1:19:03] everybody will be dumb
[1:19:05] like them in hell. They even say they
[1:19:08] will go to hell and they will enjoy
[1:19:10] because there will be so many. But I
[1:19:13] have news.
[1:19:14] I have news tonight. There are some
[1:19:17] people who will not go to hell.
[1:19:20] There are some people who are being
[1:19:21] changed.
[1:19:23] We are being changed by the world.
[1:19:26] Day by day we are being changed.
[1:19:28] Amen. How are we changed from the
[1:19:31] inside?
[1:19:33] We are realizing who we are. We are
[1:19:36] realizing our true origin.
[1:19:39] Amen. And it is coming from the inside
[1:19:42] to the outside.
[1:19:45] From the inside to the outside.
[1:19:49] We are changing at different levels.
[1:19:53] But we are all children.
[1:19:56] That's why we have to be very very very
[1:19:58] patient with one another.
[1:20:04] We do not have to have a negative
[1:20:05] attitude.
[1:20:08] We don't have we should never have a
[1:20:10] contentious spirit.
[1:20:13] We should never have a a spirit of
[1:20:16] discord.
[1:20:18] When somebody you dismiss them,
[1:20:23] oh brother, when the spirit of God comes
[1:20:25] in your heart, you will have love,
[1:20:29] you will have love for your brother. You
[1:20:32] will have love for your sister. Even
[1:20:34] when they go wrong,
[1:20:37] You are willing in love
[1:20:41] to bring them back.
[1:20:44] That's why we're saying that this
[1:20:46] message.
[1:20:48] Amen. It makes me love everybody.
[1:20:52] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. This
[1:20:56] is the principle
[1:20:58] to the two vines that grow side by side.
[1:21:02] Let's continue. The wheat and the tears.
[1:21:07] which from the first age until now have
[1:21:10] grown side by side
[1:21:16] havevested.
[1:21:18] Now when are they harvested
[1:21:21] in the last age after the last age
[1:21:25] the Bible you know the Bible says now
[1:21:27] what Nia set out to accomplish has
[1:21:31] finally come to pass.
[1:21:38] You know the council started the council
[1:21:40] of churches in a way in a way
[1:21:45] they organize
[1:21:48] they organize the church into one
[1:21:52] but they organize it into into an
[1:21:53] organization.
[1:21:56] Amen. And yet church has never been an
[1:21:58] organization.
[1:22:01] You see, it's been a movement, but they
[1:22:02] made it an organization.
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:07] And the Nian Council, the Nissian
[1:22:09] Council,
[1:22:12] it says here, what they set out to
[1:22:13] accomplish
[1:22:16] now in our church. It has finally come
[1:22:18] to pass.
[1:22:20] With all the might of organization
[1:22:24] and the false church
[1:22:26] turns from any vestage of truth and with
[1:22:29] political might, they reinforce herself
[1:22:32] with a state backing the government
[1:22:34] backing them and they set out to
[1:22:38] eradicate forever the true believer.
[1:22:40] This false church
[1:22:43] today we see them as a huge organization
[1:22:48] even here in Uganda Uganda
[1:22:50] and all over the world actually they
[1:22:52] have you know you know huge church
[1:22:54] building
[1:22:56] crowds and crowd
[1:22:59] the state backing government back.
[1:23:03] So now they set out
[1:23:07] eradicate.
[1:23:09] They set out
[1:23:12] the true believer.
[1:23:16] But just when she is about to accomplish
[1:23:19] her cowardly plot,
[1:23:27] the wheat,
[1:23:29] which is a seed now, is gathered.
[1:23:33] into the Ghana
[1:23:36] the wheat gathered into the
[1:23:41] why because we have overcome
[1:23:45] not because we are escaping
[1:23:48] but because we have overcome
[1:23:51] you have to understand church the
[1:23:54] rapture is not an escape
[1:23:56] the rapture is an overcoming
[1:24:00] you are going to go in the rapture
[1:24:03] because you have overcome.
[1:24:07] Amen.
[1:24:08] How do you overcome? You overcome by
[1:24:10] believing the word no matter what.
[1:24:16] Oh, you don't look like you are
[1:24:17] overcoming. Friends, you are not
[1:24:20] responding like you are overcoming.
[1:24:23] You overcome by receiving every word of
[1:24:25] God.
[1:24:28] I say no matter what
[1:24:32] Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] No longer will the wheat and the tears
[1:24:37] grow side by side.
[1:24:43] No longer will the tears receive the
[1:24:44] blessing of God because of the presence
[1:24:47] of the wicked.
[1:24:53] Did you know? Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:56] Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] Amen.
[1:24:59] Did you know? that all the anointing,
[1:25:04] are you hearing me? All the anointing
[1:25:07] flowing in the denominations
[1:25:10] is because of us
[1:25:13] still being here on earth.
[1:25:18] When we go,
[1:25:21] the revival will stop.
[1:25:24] The anointing will dry up.
[1:25:28] It is because of the bride.
[1:25:32] They are not consumed.
[1:25:34] Brother, sister, you are the one holding
[1:25:37] the wrath of God.
[1:25:41] Hallelujah. Amen. The rain is coming
[1:25:43] down
[1:25:45] because you are here. The latter rain
[1:25:47] and the former reign
[1:25:49] which is the teaching reign of the word
[1:25:51] and the holy ghost
[1:25:54] is coming down
[1:25:57] here
[1:25:58] in miracle center in angry country
[1:26:03] they are speaking in tong out there
[1:26:06] you know
[1:26:09] they speaking in tong that anointing
[1:26:13] is because you are
[1:26:16] Because the bride of Christ is here.
[1:26:19] When she leaves,
[1:26:21] everything will dry up
[1:26:25] and the tribulation will start.
[1:26:28] Even so, come Lord Jesus.
[1:26:32] Oh, we are tired of this sin, sick.
[1:26:38] We are tired of this rotting flesh.
[1:26:42] We are yearning for another body.
[1:26:45] Wherein there is no sin.
[1:26:48] Wherein there is no problem.
[1:26:51] There is no suffering.
[1:26:53] Oh, we are longing for that body.
[1:26:57] Are you longing for
[1:27:00] even so
[1:27:03] come Lord Jesus?
[1:27:06] Amen.
[1:27:08] No longer would they receive the
[1:27:09] blessings of God.
[1:27:12] because of of the presence of the wheat.
[1:27:15] For the wheat
[1:27:18] will be gone,
[1:27:20] and the wrath of God
[1:27:22] will be powered out
[1:27:25] in the sixth seal.
[1:27:28] Now we know the sixth seal is the
[1:27:30] judgment seal
[1:27:33] is the wrath of God powering onto the
[1:27:34] world
[1:27:37] the tribul the great tribulation.
[1:27:40] So he says you see then the wrath of God
[1:27:42] will be powered up
[1:27:44] in the sixth seal which will end in the
[1:27:48] utter destruction of the wicked
[1:27:52] but I won't be here then.
[1:27:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:58] Amen.
[1:27:59] Now, I said a moment ago
[1:28:02] that the first vine came into full
[1:28:05] fruition in this age.
[1:28:11] How fruit would mature and ripen.
[1:28:16] That is correct. truth. The evil
[1:28:18] spirited church
[1:28:21] full of iniquity
[1:28:23] will be revealed
[1:28:25] as the mustard seed that grew into a
[1:28:28] tree
[1:28:31] wherein lodge the fowls of the earth
[1:28:39] will be the antichrist,
[1:28:41] the mystery of iniquity.
[1:28:44] All this is true. And if it is true,
[1:28:47] then it must also be true
[1:28:51] that the bright church
[1:28:54] will mature
[1:28:57] and her ripeness
[1:29:00] shall be an identification
[1:29:05] with her Lord by means of the word.
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:14] that is going to show that we are ripe
[1:29:16] now because we are identifying with the
[1:29:18] onemen.
[1:29:23] Hallelujah.
[1:29:25] And I heard who will come to her is the
[1:29:28] mystery of godliness.
[1:29:35] The false vine, she has her head
[1:29:39] as a mystery of iniquity.
[1:29:42] Amen. But the bright church
[1:29:45] has a head, has a mystery of godliness,
[1:29:52] which is Christ.
[1:29:55] And as the false church with all cunning
[1:29:57] and diabolical power made up of
[1:29:59] political force,
[1:30:06] I
[1:30:08] physical force
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:11] and physical force
[1:30:13] and demons of darkness
[1:30:16] come against this true vine.
[1:30:19] Are you hearing as I'm finishing
[1:30:21] this force
[1:30:24] is going to come at us.
[1:30:29] God help us.
[1:30:32] Diabolical power of Satan with all
[1:30:36] cunningness
[1:30:38] will come at the true church
[1:30:42] in in the form of political force
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:47] physical force
[1:30:50] and demons of darkness
[1:30:53] they will come against you. This is why
[1:30:56] Jesus said that no that all hell shall
[1:30:58] not prevail because he knew all hell was
[1:30:59] coming against you.
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:06] the true vine with the fullness of the
[1:31:08] spirit
[1:31:11] and the word
[1:31:13] will do the very acts of power that
[1:31:16] Jesus did.
[1:31:20] So let the devil bring it on
[1:31:23] and let the Lord manifest his power.
[1:31:29] Amen. That's why he says, "Touch not my
[1:31:31] anointed one.
[1:31:35] Do my prophets know how."
[1:31:38] And he says, "You are kings and priests.
[1:31:42] You are anointed.
[1:31:45] You are inspired
[1:31:47] by our God."
[1:31:49] Who is the original life?
[1:31:52] Amen. You've been restored back to that
[1:31:54] original power
[1:31:57] by the original life.
[1:32:00] Then as she nears her headstone
[1:32:05] which is becoming like him
[1:32:08] as we are coming as we are coming
[1:32:11] near the headstone
[1:32:14] becoming like Christ
[1:32:17] through the word.
[1:32:19] Jesus will come
[1:32:22] that the bride and the groom
[1:32:25] be forever united as one.
[1:32:30] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's
[1:32:32] where we are headed first.
[1:32:35] We are not here to build an
[1:32:36] organization.
[1:32:38] We're not building something here. Amen.
[1:32:41] This is what we are building
[1:32:45] to the bride and the groom to be united
[1:32:47] as well.
[1:32:51] Amen. Amen. Already the visible
[1:32:53] manifestations
[1:32:57] of what I've been telling you are seen
[1:32:59] all around us.
[1:33:02] The ecumenical move of the tears is
[1:33:04] factual.
[1:33:09] That's the council of churches.
[1:33:12] The world council of churches.
[1:33:17] It's already here with us.
[1:33:20] It's already in the world.
[1:33:23] It's coming to a time I even heard I
[1:33:26] don't know whether it is already in
[1:33:28] functional but I had now you cannot get
[1:33:30] a passport as a pastor if you're not a
[1:33:33] member of any of the of this council
[1:33:40] as a pastor.
[1:33:41] So you will not be recognized as a
[1:33:43] preacher.
[1:33:47] Maybe you put businessman or something.
[1:33:52] You can't preach.
[1:33:54] I was kicked out of Ethiopia
[1:33:57] by the government
[1:34:00] because I needed to have a a theological
[1:34:02] college certificate.
[1:34:07] That's that's how they can receive me.
[1:34:12] And to get it, you have to join one of
[1:34:14] their of their of of their seminaries,
[1:34:19] it would be hypocrisy
[1:34:21] to say you don't believe in their
[1:34:22] doctrine
[1:34:25] and yet you're trained by them.
[1:34:28] I wouldn't want that woman just able to
[1:34:31] train me.
[1:34:34] I'd want the Holy Ghost to train.
[1:34:37] So I said, "All right, I'll exit."
[1:34:40] Time will come when this little in in
[1:34:42] Rwanda you know what what is happening
[1:34:45] time is coming very soon when this will
[1:34:48] be global
[1:34:51] in many of the countries
[1:34:54] that I I've gone to have a church
[1:34:58] normally without issues
[1:35:01] is a problem you have to hide you have
[1:35:04] to put sound proof you have even in
[1:35:07] developed especially in developed
[1:35:13] But the big big big organizations are
[1:35:15] okay.
[1:35:18] The problem is you
[1:35:21] the little little little ones who are
[1:35:22] not known.
[1:35:25] Let me finish up here. The ecumenical
[1:35:27] move of the tears is factual.
[1:35:32] We have one minute quickly.
[1:35:34] Is factual.
[1:35:36] But also it is a fact that the prophet
[1:35:38] of the last age must be bringing forth a
[1:35:41] message from God
[1:35:46] which will for the second coming of the
[1:35:48] Lord.
[1:35:51] For by his message with the hearts of
[1:35:54] the children
[1:35:55] be turned back to the Pentecost
[1:35:58] and with the restoration of the word
[1:36:02] will come the restoration of the power.
[1:36:07] Amen.
[1:36:09] Amen. Amen. God bless you. May you may
[1:36:11] stand on your feet.
[1:36:14] Let's pray for those on Zoom fast.
[1:36:16] Father in the name of Jesus, ask your
[1:36:18] blessing upon your people, Father, that
[1:36:21] have been following this service.
[1:36:24] We ask your blessing, Lord. Help us all
[1:36:27] that we might uh be in Christ.
[1:36:31] Lord, we might hide oursel in Christ
[1:36:34] because we know this is real. This is
[1:36:36] coming. We want to be ready, Lord.
[1:36:40] Amen. Bless every brother, every sister.
[1:36:45] And Lord, I pray for those here. I ask
[1:36:48] that you will come down in such a
[1:36:50] special way, Lord. And may you make
[1:36:53] these things a reality to us.
[1:36:57] May you surround us when the enemy comes
[1:37:00] in like a flower.
[1:37:02] May you lift up a standard.
[1:37:05] Let your presence come upon us. And
[1:37:08] Lord,
[1:37:09] may you let the blood of Jesus
[1:37:12] cover us away from all the clothes that
[1:37:15] we need.
[1:37:17] Lord, I pray. Amen. Bless every giver
[1:37:20] that is going to give now.
[1:37:23] And Lord, may you multiply whatever they
[1:37:25] will give.
[1:37:27] towards your kingdom
[1:37:29] in Jesus name we pray.
[1:37:31] Amen.
[1:37:32] Amen.
[1:37:33] Amen.
[1:37:34] Amen. And you're free to go when you you
[1:37:36] gave.
[1:37:39] But let us just worship a little bit
[1:37:40] now.
