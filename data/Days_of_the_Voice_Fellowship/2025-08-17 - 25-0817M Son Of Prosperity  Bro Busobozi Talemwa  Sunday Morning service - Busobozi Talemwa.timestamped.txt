[0:00] Lord, precious father, this morning you
[0:03] have brought us here, Father, from
[0:04] different walks of life. Father, Lord
[0:07] Jesus, we know it has not been an easy
[0:10] week, Father, to some of us. But God,
[0:14] you have been faithful, Lord Jesus, as
[0:17] you told us that you'll never leave us
[0:18] alone. We have seen you fighting our
[0:21] battles. We have seen you healing, Lord,
[0:24] our diseases. And father, even this
[0:27] morning, your grace is sufficient for
[0:29] us, Lord. As we're approaching that
[0:32] throne of grace, we are entering through
[0:34] the door of the blood of Jesus. And we
[0:37] ask you this morning that may the
[0:38] precious blood of Jesus stand between us
[0:41] and Lord our sins, Lord. Release your
[0:45] precious blood this morning and cleanse
[0:48] each and every worshipper this morning.
[0:49] Father, may you p us this day, oh God.
[0:53] cleanse us and father receive us Lord.
[0:56] Each one of us we have come Lord with a
[0:58] sacrifice this morning to worship you
[1:00] Lord. And we pray that Father may our
[1:04] sacrifice be consumed this morning by
[1:06] the holy fire Lord Jesus. Father, where
[1:10] we have strayed during the course of
[1:12] this week in our imagination, our words,
[1:16] our action, we ask you this morning to
[1:18] forgive us, Lord. Just as you say that,
[1:21] come and let us reason together. Though
[1:23] our sins be like scarlet, you'll make
[1:26] them white as snow. Though they be like
[1:28] crimson, you wash them and they'll be
[1:31] white as the wool. Precious Father, this
[1:33] morning, may the Holy Spirit come and
[1:36] take full preeminence in this service.
[1:38] May you move in a special way, Lord. If
[1:41] there be those who are sick and
[1:43] afflicted this morning, for the Bible
[1:45] say that you send your word and your
[1:47] word heals us. Lord, may you touch each
[1:50] one of us this morning from the crown of
[1:52] our head to the sole of our feet. Lord
[1:54] Jesus, circumcise our lips and our
[1:57] hearts. Anoint the musician, anoint the
[1:59] congregation, anoint the preaching of
[2:01] the word this morning, Father, even the
[2:03] song leader that your grace will be
[2:06] sufficient, Lord. May you save all those
[2:09] are savable this morning. May you make
[2:11] us new Christian, Lord. Father, we thank
[2:14] you. We turn against every evil spirit
[2:16] in the name of Jesus. Satan, you have no
[2:19] right. We drive out of this place. We
[2:22] render you powerless in the name of the
[2:25] Lord Jesus Christ. Father, may that
[2:27] pillar of fire move this morning and you
[2:29] make us flexible that Lord, we shall
[2:31] move with a cloud this morning. Oh God,
[2:34] have your own way, Lord Jesus.
[2:38] remember even those who are still on the
[2:40] way. May you quicken their footstep Lord
[2:42] in the most precious name of the Lord
[2:44] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.

[48:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel thrilled in my heart.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. To know that I'll be there.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, my sound is not really
[48:25] that perfect, but I'm so happy this
[48:27] morning
[48:29] and I'm seeing many who thought that the
[48:31] pastor will not be here this morning
[48:32] another church
[48:37] and I hope and I pray that this church
[48:39] does not really adopt that principle
[48:45] that I know that usually when the pastor
[48:47] is not around many churches you know the
[48:50] people that's when they will get trips
[48:51] that's when they will travel that's when
[48:52] they will go to do this
[48:59] It's as if like they have a holiday.
[49:03] But we don't really come here for the
[49:05] pastor.
[49:07] We come here for the Lord.
[49:09] And let us make it um you know a custom
[49:12] whether the pastor is around or not.
[49:18] Let us be at our post of view.
[49:22] Tell your neighbor, is that amen?
[49:24] [Music]
[49:26] All right. So, um I was not meant to be
[49:28] here this weekend.
[49:32] I was, as I told you, supposed to be
[49:34] ministering
[49:36] uh for some churches in Haral this
[49:38] weekend.
[49:42] And I'm speaking while I'm waiting for
[49:44] you to put up those videos and and and
[49:46] photos. I think you have it on the media
[49:49] group, Brother Isaac and Brother Marvin.
[49:52] So I was supposed to be uh there with
[49:54] them this weekend.
[49:57] Uh but um I felt it in my heart to
[49:59] cancel that appointment and be here
[50:04] because
[50:06] because we have a lot of u um unfinished
[50:09] business to do
[50:11] [Music]
[50:13] regarding our youth camp that is
[50:14] happening
[50:17] regarding uh the um the land
[50:24] that we are trying to acquire. Yeah.
[50:27] And um and uh so I thought it is
[50:29] important to be here this weekend so we
[50:31] can be able to handle it.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; So but for now I'm going to give you a
[50:39] little report.
[50:42] [Music]
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. You do you have all the pictures?
[50:49] Uh it's on the media group.
[50:54] Y not in order. Okay, no problem. As
[50:56] long as you have all of them and the
[50:57] video as well. Okay, so uh so this is
[51:02] the church that we had went to attend
[51:04] their dedication
[51:06] [Music]
[51:08] and um personally I first visited this
[51:10] church when they were still renting some
[51:12] um some more than 10 years ago.
[51:19] And uh uh
[51:22] the reason why I went on this trip,
[51:27] &gt;&gt; I went to tap the anointing.
[51:31] I I I went to be inspired
[51:36] &gt;&gt; because you know if you're not inspired
[51:38] right
[51:40] sometimes you are all by yourself in
[51:42] your own little world
[51:46] and you do not know that things can be
[51:48] done until you see others doing them.
[51:54] Then you begin to believe that the same
[51:56] God who did it for them can do it for
[51:57] you.
[52:03] You know these brothers started also
[52:04] humble like all of us.
[52:08] I would want to tell you that the
[52:09] message in Zimbabwe has really
[52:10] progressed so much.
[52:14] It's not like here in Uganda.
[52:17] Here in Uganda
[52:19] we do not have uh we've not accomplished
[52:23] as much as they have accomplished.
[52:28] Um uh there's no way I can be able to
[52:30] overemphasize that
[52:34] like I will give you an example
[52:37] and I'm going to give you a few more
[52:38] pictures just in a moment
[52:40] but I'll tell you this in Zimbabwe
[52:44] &gt;&gt; during the weekend when we were there
[52:47] uh we they had about three main meetings
[52:53] conventions.
[52:55] one was the uh was the one we were at
[53:00] actually myself and pastor Gideon were
[53:02] at that
[53:04] because both of us are friends to pastor
[53:05] Joseph
[53:08] &gt;&gt; and so uh but this was about 3 4,000
[53:11] people
[53:14] and it was not the biggest
[53:18] and but you see and all these people
[53:21] that came on that on that meeting
[53:26] um are a part of the ministry of brother
[53:30] Chikos.
[53:33] You know he started a church the first
[53:35] church in Mutar that is about 250
[53:38] kilometers away
[53:42] then in Haral the capital city
[53:46] then now he's in the UK where he pastor
[53:51] but in all these churches
[53:54] well of course is um is respected as the
[53:57] founder and the pastor
[54:01] but then there are many other churches
[54:04] that sprung out of his ministry.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Talk about brother Martin,
[54:11] &gt;&gt; brother Julius, brother shame somewhere
[54:14] whoever and they all spread out
[54:19] and they have also b other churches.
[54:23] You understand? So you find that there
[54:26] are several bishops
[54:28] [Music]
[54:29] in his ministry that have started under
[54:31] his ministry.
[54:34] And um that was I found it to be really
[54:37] a commendable thing
[54:40] and um so all those churches now came
[54:43] together
[54:44] [Music]
[54:45] at this dedication.
[54:48] The number I told you about 3 4 thousand
[54:50] are not all the people
[54:54] those are the ones who could come
[54:57] and so but then there were other
[54:59] meetings
[55:02] in was another meeting
[55:05] that's another friend of mine who I have
[55:07] ministered for
[55:11] pastor Dr.
[55:14] Also there were a few thousands there
[55:18] then also you in another in actually
[55:20] where we were in
[55:23] there was now the biggest meeting
[55:25] another biggest meeting
[55:27] I think I was told about 16,000 or
[55:30] something like that
[55:33] and um and um you know that's not
[55:36] reflecting all the believers in the
[55:37] country
[55:42] So in Uganda
[55:46] we are still joking
[55:49] there is a lot of work to do
[55:53] and um
[55:55] I tell you I told my family I said I'll
[55:58] not say this but I'm now going to say
[56:02] uh
[56:04] some trips
[56:06] you go to learn
[56:09] so on this trip I went in a Bible
[56:15] and myself and pastor Gideon were given
[56:16] a cottage. We're staying together
[56:21] and in one apartment.
[56:25] We talked a lot regarding ministry,
[56:30] regarding the work of the ministry
[56:32] and how how um how much is needed to be
[56:36] done in Uganda.
[56:39] I tell you what,
[56:41] Um those that time was a time of
[56:44] refreshing,
[56:46] a time of learning a lot of things
[56:50] and a time of being challenged.
[56:53] There's a lot more that we can do for
[56:55] the Lord.
[56:57] We need to catch the vision.
[57:01] We need to catch the vision.
[57:04] Can Can you give us more pictures?
[57:06] That's Pastor Chos right there.
[57:09] You know, he was supposed to be our come
[57:11] speaker for last year, but
[57:14] because of the accident he had.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Keep playing the photos, brother.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's the Bible believers.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; That's the cornerstone.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Just keep just keep keep going. Keep
[57:29] going. Keep going.
[57:31] Um, is it possible to remove these
[57:32] lights by this area so that the people
[57:35] can see?
[57:37] Brother Martin, please
[57:40] keep keep playing the video. The
[57:48] brother Marvin, I I expect you to
[57:50] continue. Just continue.
[57:53] Okay. Yeah, that's the speed I want.
[57:55] Yeah.
[57:58] Okay. Wait. So, that's outside.
[58:03] Um, you know, the people are so many
[58:06] and um, uh, they were just Okay,
[58:09] continue.
[58:11] That's part of the building. Continue.
[58:15] Part of the building. Continue.
[58:19] Continue.
[58:30] Yeah, that's the interior.
[58:33] continue.
[58:37] Okay. Uh we don't have a sound.
[58:47] It's okay. Just keep playing the video
[58:48] even if there is no sound.
[58:54] I don't know brother Isaac if you have
[58:55] sound online
[58:58] and brother Marvin if you could just
[59:01] throw all those videos and pictures to
[59:04] the church group so that everybody who
[59:06] is there can be able to get it on their
[59:07] phone
[59:11] so you can now try to see everything. We
[59:14] were gathering in that tent outside
[59:16] there
[59:18] &gt;&gt; cuz every not everybody could fit in the
[59:20] building.
[59:42] So we got packed in there
[59:45] as many as could enter
[59:48] to do the dedication.
[59:49] [Music]
[59:58] Sometimes we can't believe until we see
[1:00:04] now we have seen I'm not showing off
[1:00:07] someone someone's work
[1:00:11] their father is our father
[1:00:14] you understand so what I'm saying we are
[1:00:17] more than able
[1:00:20] If God can do it for them,
[1:00:22] he can do it for us.
[1:00:25] We need to rise in faith.
[1:00:28] Um, you know, they did all that by their
[1:00:32] by themselves.
[1:00:35] There was no sponsor.
[1:00:39] Some of you people are not giving
[1:00:42] towards the church projects
[1:00:46] because you somehow believe a sponsor
[1:00:48] will come.
[1:00:51] That's a poor man's mindset.
[1:00:57] And until that mindset is gone,
[1:01:02] we should not expect these things to
[1:01:04] happen in our lives.
[1:01:07] But that mindset
[1:01:09] We should give it up
[1:01:12] and believe that we are the ones to do
[1:01:15] the work.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; You when I say we, I mean me.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Just say I mean me.
[1:01:24] Say say me.
[1:01:26] You you are the one supposed to do the
[1:01:28] work.
[1:01:31] So I saw so much until I said no, let me
[1:01:33] go back home.
[1:01:36] And um I I I hate to say no when I'm
[1:01:38] asked to minister but I said no let me
[1:01:40] go back home.
[1:01:44] I need to in to show these things to my
[1:01:48] people
[1:01:50] and inspire them.
[1:01:53] Tell them we have seen that the land is
[1:01:56] good
[1:01:57] and flowing with milk and honey and we
[1:02:00] can take it.
[1:02:02] Hallelujah. We are more than able to
[1:02:04] take it.
[1:02:06] We are more than able to take it.
[1:02:10] There is a sister who sent me I don't
[1:02:13] know she must have been moved. I I
[1:02:15] received these messages past midnight,
[1:02:19] almost 2 a.m.
[1:02:22] And she sent a message to me and she
[1:02:25] said, "I used to be at my mother church
[1:02:30] somewhere, some other place,
[1:02:32] but old people could do old things.
[1:02:36] I could look at myself saying I'm
[1:02:39] young."
[1:02:42] those ones contributions they are for
[1:02:44] the elder
[1:02:47] but I reached this side
[1:02:50] and I heard them talking of
[1:02:52] contributions
[1:02:54] and I was like they're speaking to the
[1:02:57] elder
[1:03:00] then I looked around and I was like I'm
[1:03:03] almost the same age like most of you
[1:03:08] are you following
[1:03:10] so she left her
[1:03:12] came here DVF
[1:03:14] and at her church she did not used to
[1:03:17] give any contribution
[1:03:19] because she thought those are for the
[1:03:21] elders
[1:03:23] for the old people the ones who have a
[1:03:26] lot of money
[1:03:28] but when she came here she heard that
[1:03:31] everybody I mean we are talking about
[1:03:32] contributions
[1:03:34] she said ah well it's for the old people
[1:03:37] so but when she looked around
[1:03:40] she saw and noticed that uh she was
[1:03:43] almost the same age like everybody else.
[1:03:47] So I could just feel good
[1:03:51] when I find church renovated. This is
[1:03:54] now back home.
[1:04:00] I could not know how
[1:04:03] I just clap my hands
[1:04:06] because I'm sitting comfortable.
[1:04:09] But God has directed me to this place
[1:04:11] here
[1:04:14] for a purposeful training.
[1:04:18] And she's saying something tells me
[1:04:22] you will now clap with a purpose.
[1:04:27] I really don't need to know anything
[1:04:30] because I found church built.
[1:04:33] But here I am learning how it is done.
[1:04:40] And I did not plan to read that sister.
[1:04:44] I felt is very appropriate.
[1:04:48] Maybe there are some who are like her.
[1:04:55] For the people,
[1:04:56] the elderly, the ones who have grown up.
[1:04:59] Look around you. Look around.
[1:05:01] Come on, take
[1:05:03] accept. Turn around. Look around. Look
[1:05:06] behind you on the left and on the right.
[1:05:10] Okay. Who are the elders you're talking
[1:05:12] about?
[1:05:14] It is actually you. Some of you when you
[1:05:16] look around, you actually the elder.
[1:05:21] So what I'm saying? No one is going to
[1:05:23] do this work.
[1:05:26] We are going to do this work
[1:05:29] by ourself.
[1:05:32] you are going to do the work
[1:05:35] and um I'm going to reserve the other
[1:05:37] comments
[1:05:41] after the word. We'll have a little
[1:05:44] session of the word and
[1:05:47] I know some others have to go out. They
[1:05:50] have other schedules.
[1:05:53] Sister Rose told me she's in the
[1:05:55] village.
[1:05:57] I think for the court issues we
[1:05:58] mentioned last time.
[1:06:01] And um so I would try to be a little
[1:06:04] brief today

[1:06:08] business

[1:06:17] and go to Genesis chapter 39

[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are reading Genesis chapter 39.
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:26] Uh we'll read verses 1 to 5 and then we
[1:11:30] read verses 21.
[1:11:35] Amen. And I'm reading in the name of the
[1:11:36] Lord.
[1:11:38] And Joseph was brought down to Egypt.
[1:11:42] And Portifer,
[1:11:44] an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the
[1:11:47] God, an Egyptian, bought him of the
[1:11:50] hands of the Ishalites, which had
[1:11:53] brought him down thther. And the Lord
[1:11:57] was with Joseph, and he was pro a
[1:11:59] prosperous man. And uh he was in the
[1:12:03] house of uh his master, the Egyptian.
[1:12:06] And his master saw that the Lord was
[1:12:08] with him, and that the Lord made all
[1:12:10] that he did to prosper in his hand.
[1:12:16] And Joseph found grace in his sight, and
[1:12:19] he served him, and he made him of a seer
[1:12:22] over his house. And all that he had, he
[1:12:27] put into his hand. And it came to pass
[1:12:31] from the time that he had made him
[1:12:33] overseer in his house and over all that
[1:12:37] he had that the Lord blessed the
[1:12:40] Egyptian his house for Joseph's sake.
[1:12:43] And the blessing of the Lord was upon
[1:12:45] all, not some, all that he had in the
[1:12:50] house. Oh my God. And in the field, not
[1:12:53] only the house, but also in the field. H
[1:12:57] praise the name of the Lord.
[1:12:59] Amen. And um if you look at verses 21,
[1:13:03] if you
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; go to verses 21,
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; then he says, "And Joseph uh but the
[1:13:09] Lord
[1:13:11] was with Joseph and showed him mercy and
[1:13:15] gave him favor in the sight of the
[1:13:18] keeper of the prison." And the and the
[1:13:21] keeper of the prison committed to J
[1:13:24] Josephan all the prisoners that were in
[1:13:29] the prison. And whatsoever they did
[1:13:32] there, he was the doer of it. The keeper
[1:13:36] of the prison looked to any looked not
[1:13:38] to anything that was under his hand
[1:13:41] because the Lord was with him. And that
[1:13:44] which he did, the Lord
[1:13:47] made it to prosper.
[1:13:51] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:13:53] seated.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; This morning by the grace of God, I want
[1:13:56] to speak to you. I want to begin
[1:13:57] speaking to you. I don't know whether I
[1:13:59] will finish today on the son or son of
[1:14:02] prosperity.
[1:14:11] Hallelujah. Tell your neighbor,
[1:14:13] prosperity.
[1:14:15] Prosperity.
[1:14:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; I think that Uganda has it perfect
[1:14:23] because in this word is from Hebrew
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; and the word in Hebrew is uh shall shall
[1:14:35] I don't know whether I'm pronouncing it
[1:14:36] perfectly.
[1:14:38] And according to Hebrew, it means
[1:14:41] to push forward,
[1:14:45] to advance,
[1:14:49] to make progress,
[1:14:52] to succeed,
[1:14:55] to be profitable,
[1:15:00] to be profitable.
[1:15:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:07] So now
[1:15:08] We are taking an example of Joseph here
[1:15:12] and I want to speak to you on prosperity
[1:15:14] today. Not as in just the way of the
[1:15:17] world.
[1:15:21] My brother, the one who is working on
[1:15:23] the sound. I still am not feeling that
[1:15:26] the sound is perfect.
[1:15:28] So I'm not talking the way you would
[1:15:30] think that the way others talk about
[1:15:32] prosperity
[1:15:35] because people think that prosperity is
[1:15:36] when you have a lot of money.
[1:15:40] No. And we are going to find out today.
[1:15:43] But I'm talking about advancing,
[1:15:48] succeeding,
[1:15:50] making progress.
[1:15:53] Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] Your amens are still very weak.
[1:15:58] Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; So now Joseph was not loved by his
[1:16:04] brethren.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And please stay in one place so we
[1:16:08] can get done with this very fast.
[1:16:11] He wasn't loved by his brethren. Do you
[1:16:14] know why
[1:16:18] he was a blessed child?
[1:16:20] He was a favored child.
[1:16:23] His father loved him.
[1:16:26] You remember how he gave him a C of many
[1:16:28] colors
[1:16:30] and it made all the brothers jealousy.
[1:16:33] He was highly favored.
[1:16:36] And because they hated him, they thought
[1:16:40] that they will push him aside.
[1:16:43] They thought they would sabotage him.
[1:16:46] They thought they would make him
[1:16:48] decline.
[1:16:51] But they did not know he was a favorite
[1:16:54] child.
[1:16:56] And so they took him and and and and and
[1:17:01] sold him and well of course you remember
[1:17:04] the story how they wanted to
[1:17:07] put him down somewhere
[1:17:09] and uh you know others had an idea. Let
[1:17:11] us just send him off but let me tell you
[1:17:14] brothers a seed of God
[1:17:18] which is actually the word of God we've
[1:17:19] been talking about. We have been talking
[1:17:21] about seed
[1:17:23] in terms of the word
[1:17:26] and we also found out seed in terms of
[1:17:30] you.
[1:17:33] Are you following me? You can never
[1:17:36] destroy the seed.
[1:17:39] Seed is meant to prosper.
[1:17:43] Seed is meant to multiply.
[1:17:46] When you a seed
[1:17:49] that seed will multiply.
[1:17:51] It is the principle. It is a law of
[1:17:54] nature.
[1:17:56] When you buy a seed,
[1:17:59] seed multiply.
[1:18:02] Praise the name of the Lord. And so they
[1:18:05] took Joseph and and and and they sold
[1:18:08] him off. And of course they thought we
[1:18:10] are done with it. And they deceived
[1:18:13] their father that he was eaten by
[1:18:15] animals.
[1:18:19] But you cannot deceive.
[1:18:22] No one can deceive.
[1:18:25] The Bible says God is not mocked.
[1:18:28] That which you saw,
[1:18:31] you shall read.
[1:18:33] Hallelujah. But Joseph could not be
[1:18:36] destroyed.
[1:18:39] There are a people on on the world today
[1:18:42] that are working in the grace and
[1:18:44] anointing of God.
[1:18:48] These are people that are
[1:18:51] indestructible.
[1:18:55] Prosperity
[1:18:57] moves with them.
[1:19:01] They cannot be destroyed.
[1:19:05] They cannot be made poor.
[1:19:08] They cannot remain behind.
[1:19:12] They are meant to be
[1:19:15] and not take.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not about what they have
[1:19:20] done.
[1:19:22] It's about who they are.
[1:19:27] Are you following me so far? So now they
[1:19:30] take Joseph and sell him off. And these
[1:19:33] people you know Joseph ends up in the
[1:19:36] house of Portifer
[1:19:40] in Egypt. Now while in the house of
[1:19:42] Portifer you might say Joseph is
[1:19:45] finished
[1:19:47] he has gone among an unbelievers.
[1:19:52] But the devil did not know
[1:19:54] that Joseph was a son of prosperity.
[1:20:01] And when he reached Egypt,
[1:20:03] we have read it here,
[1:20:05] you know, actually Portifer
[1:20:08] realized how blessed this young man is
[1:20:13] because everything he was doing was
[1:20:15] prospering.
[1:20:17] And so what he did, he put everything he
[1:20:21] had
[1:20:23] in the hand of Joseph
[1:20:26] and he told him, "Joseph, take care of
[1:20:28] my estate.
[1:20:31] No one came to Portifer
[1:20:34] but only through Joseph.
[1:20:36] It is either through Joseph
[1:20:39] or it won't happen.
[1:20:41] Talk about access.
[1:20:43] Talk about favor.
[1:20:45] That's what Joseph Joseph's position
[1:20:47] was.
[1:20:49] And Joseph prospered in everything he
[1:20:53] did.
[1:20:54] He prospered in everything in his hand.
[1:20:58] He prospered when he was with the
[1:21:00] Ishmael.
[1:21:02] He prospered when he was in the house of
[1:21:05] so much until one time. Now Portifer
[1:21:10] said, "You are going to take care of my
[1:21:12] yesterday."
[1:21:14] The Bible actually says the man did not
[1:21:17] even know what he had.
[1:21:22] Only Joseph had the knowledge
[1:21:26] of what? The wealth of the man.
[1:21:33] Sister, peace. Think about it.
[1:21:36] If you are in the position of Joseph,
[1:21:43] think about it. Forget about the
[1:21:46] history.
[1:21:48] Take yourself there
[1:21:51] brother. If you are the one in that
[1:21:53] place, you are the one who knows the
[1:21:55] wealth of your master.
[1:21:58] So who is the one who is rich?
[1:22:01] You or your master?
[1:22:04] You
[1:22:05] because he doesn't know how much he has.
[1:22:08] You might as well use it anyhow you
[1:22:09] want.
[1:22:13] But you see it wasn't that Pifer was
[1:22:16] rich.
[1:22:18] It was Joseph
[1:22:20] that everything he touched
[1:22:23] prospered.
[1:22:25] [Applause]
[1:22:27] And one day uh you know his he's the
[1:22:31] wife of Portifer finds him and he says,
[1:22:34] "Joseph,
[1:22:36] come unto me." And Joseph said, "No, I
[1:22:39] cannot do that.
[1:22:42] My master put everything to my child
[1:22:46] in his house except for you
[1:22:50] because you are his wife.
[1:22:53] Joseph was a honest man. He was a
[1:22:56] sincere man.
[1:22:58] And his wife, the wife of said, "No, you
[1:23:02] can't do that to me."
[1:23:04] And so Joseph said,
[1:23:07] "Let me run away."
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; And then he decided to run.
[1:23:12] And as he was running, the woman caught
[1:23:15] one of his garments. She said, "Ah, you
[1:23:17] can remain with it.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; But let me run for myself.
[1:23:27] Do we have people in our generation?
[1:23:30] Do we have younger men in our generation
[1:23:33] who are going to have that attitude
[1:23:35] to tell Portifer's wife to remain with
[1:23:38] everything she wants to remain with?
[1:23:41] But you run for your life.
[1:23:44] You run for what you stand for.
[1:23:47] You run for what you believe in.
[1:23:50] And and and and he ran. But you see, you
[1:23:54] cannot. It is either your word orifer's
[1:23:56] wife's word.
[1:24:00] Who do you think would believe?
[1:24:03] Of course, she he would believe his wife
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; because this was his wife.
[1:24:12] This Hebrew boy you brought here.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; What is it my dear?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; You don't want to know what you did to
[1:24:21] me.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He came into me and he tried to rap me
[1:24:31] and Joseph was not there
[1:24:35] but still there was a witness.
[1:24:40] I want to try and show you
[1:24:43] what happens
[1:24:45] when you receive the word,
[1:24:48] when you take the word. When you leave
[1:24:51] the word, what happens in your life?
[1:24:55] I'm going to be brief. Much of my
[1:24:58] preaching today is quotes,
[1:25:01] but nevertheless, follow me closely.
[1:25:04] I want to show you that you are at
[1:25:07] nobody's mercies in this world.
[1:25:13] That you are not what you are because of
[1:25:15] what someone did for you.
[1:25:20] Don't allow someone to put a rope in
[1:25:23] your neck
[1:25:25] and try to control you.
[1:25:29] No one should control you.
[1:25:32] If you are in the position or in the
[1:25:34] shoes of Joseph,
[1:25:37] there is a grace
[1:25:39] that is upon your life
[1:25:42] that has been following you from the
[1:25:44] time you were born. And when you came
[1:25:47] into this message, let me tell you, it
[1:25:50] was activated.
[1:25:53] And that is what will see you through
[1:25:56] your entire life.
[1:26:00] No, you're not an enemy masses of
[1:26:01] anybody.
[1:26:04] We are the masses of only our Lord.
[1:26:08] As long as we are standing on the word,
[1:26:10] he will see to it.
[1:26:13] And he will deal with all our enemies
[1:26:17] even in our absence.
[1:26:22] Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Joseph was not there.
[1:26:29] And this woman began to connive and to
[1:26:32] talk and to lie and to blackmail him.
[1:26:39] But God was there.
[1:26:41] Sister, when you are standing on the
[1:26:43] word,
[1:26:45] God is always there and God fights for
[1:26:48] you
[1:26:49] and God will always fight for you.
[1:26:52] I am trying to explain to you what
[1:26:55] prosperity is.
[1:26:58] Joseph had no money but he was a
[1:27:00] prosperous man.
[1:27:03] And at that moment as as she tried to do
[1:27:06] all that
[1:27:09] the man said bring that boy here
[1:27:12] and they threw him in jail.
[1:27:15] And now Joseph is in jail.
[1:27:19] Now you would think it has finished.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; It was just the beginning.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; If God allows me to go through what I'm
[1:27:32] going to go through today, you'll be
[1:27:33] really blessed.
[1:27:36] Amen. Amen. Joseph was still pushing
[1:27:39] forward.
[1:27:41] Joseph still was advancing.
[1:27:44] Joseph was still making progress
[1:27:47] even in prison.
[1:27:49] He was still succeeding.
[1:27:52] Amen. The Bible says when he went to
[1:27:55] prison,
[1:27:57] listen to these words. It says right
[1:27:59] here. Praise the Lord. But the Lord,
[1:28:05] well, the Bible says, "And Joseph,
[1:28:06] Joseph's master took him and put him
[1:28:08] into the prison,
[1:28:11] a place where the king's prisoners were
[1:28:13] bound.
[1:28:15] And he was there in the prison.
[1:28:18] But the Lord
[1:28:20] was with Joseph.
[1:28:24] Hallelujah.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; You want to understand why the Lord was
[1:28:26] with Joseph?
[1:28:30] The Lord was with Joseph
[1:28:33] and he showed him mercy
[1:28:36] and he gave him favor.
[1:28:39] Amen. When the Lord is with you, he
[1:28:42] gives you mercy. He gives you favor.
[1:28:46] Let me tell you brother, how do you know
[1:28:48] the Lord is with you?
[1:28:50] When you are standing in the water.
[1:28:54] Amen. Hallelujah. When you are Amen.
[1:28:56] When you are when you are eating the
[1:28:58] open book,
[1:29:00] then the Lord is with you.
[1:29:03] Hallelujah.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; And if the Lord is with you, he will
[1:29:05] always show you mercy. He will always
[1:29:08] show you favor.
[1:29:12] Hallelujah.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; The brothers think he's dead.
[1:29:16] thinks he's punishing him. But God was
[1:29:19] very busy,
[1:29:21] progressing him.
[1:29:25] And the Lord was with Joseph
[1:29:28] and he showed him mercy
[1:29:31] and gave him favor
[1:29:34] in the sight of the keeper of the
[1:29:36] prison.
[1:29:40] And the keeper of the prison committed
[1:29:42] to Joseph's hand.
[1:29:47] all the prisoners
[1:29:49] that were in the prison.
[1:29:52] So tell me, was Joseph a prisoner
[1:29:56] or a prison keeper?
[1:30:00] Oh, may God help us this morning to get
[1:30:04] into that realm
[1:30:06] to be able to apply this to our life.
[1:30:11] Amen. Hallelujah. You know we sing a
[1:30:13] song these bars are born
[1:30:18] about a prison but one day they going to
[1:30:20] bust.
[1:30:23] You know you are in this prison but you
[1:30:26] are not here to submit to this prison.
[1:30:29] You are in this prison of flesh
[1:30:32] full of trials and afflictions and
[1:30:34] temptation
[1:30:36] in this world of sin. Full of sin
[1:30:38] everywhere. But you are not here
[1:30:42] to submit
[1:30:44] to what is around you.
[1:30:47] You are here to prosper.
[1:30:52] You are here to succeed.
[1:30:56] You are here. Amen. Joseph was in prison
[1:31:01] not to become a prisoner.
[1:31:05] Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he was only a prisoner.
[1:31:10] to his master. Hallelujah.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And his master
[1:31:15] was the God of Israel.
[1:31:19] Paul said, "I'm a prisoner
[1:31:23] of Jesus Christ." Let me tell you,
[1:31:26] brother, when you a prisoner of the
[1:31:29] world, Amen. No one
[1:31:33] in this world can make you a prisoner.
[1:31:38] Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; You know what? When you can stay in the
[1:31:44] word, when you can stand in the word,
[1:31:47] don't go to the left. Don't go to the
[1:31:49] right. Stick with the word. If it is not
[1:31:53] in the word, it is not your portion.
[1:31:57] You understand? If you can be a believer
[1:31:59] like that,
[1:32:02] if you have the guts
[1:32:05] to accept the word, the whole world and
[1:32:09] eat it up
[1:32:11] and leave it. You are not a prisoner of
[1:32:14] anything or anyone.
[1:32:19] You're not a prisoner of your boss. It's
[1:32:21] not your boss that will hire you or fire
[1:32:23] you.
[1:32:26] You're not a prisoner.
[1:32:28] of of your of anything,
[1:32:31] of your society, whatever you want to
[1:32:32] think of.
[1:32:34] Here is a young man. He's in prison. But
[1:32:38] while in prison, when he arrived there,
[1:32:42] the prison keeper said,
[1:32:45] "Thank you for relieving me of dy."
[1:32:50] Hallelujah. His brother sold him. But
[1:32:53] the moment you arrive in Egypt, the one
[1:32:56] the greatest man in Egypt
[1:33:00] said, "Thank you for relieving me of
[1:33:03] duty.
[1:33:05] Now everything I have is yours.
[1:33:08] Take it. Manage it.
[1:33:11] Just allow me to eat something.
[1:33:15] I just want to eat. That's why
[1:33:18] everything is in your hands.
[1:33:24] And when this man thought he had power
[1:33:27] over you,
[1:33:29] remember he was the youngest.
[1:33:32] And now here,
[1:33:35] you know, his brothers despised him. But
[1:33:38] when he arrived here,
[1:33:40] as long as they cherished him,
[1:33:44] Portifer prospered.
[1:33:48] But when a moment looked down on him,
[1:33:52] you know, God said it's all right. So
[1:33:54] sometimes you do prayers, you make
[1:33:57] prayers, oh God, take this from me.
[1:34:01] Remove this from me. Oh God. But God
[1:34:05] doesn't
[1:34:07] because he knows if he removes it,
[1:34:11] you will not understand
[1:34:14] who you are.
[1:34:17] Who you are
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; is meant to be revealed
[1:34:22] by the trials
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; and the temptations
[1:34:26] and the suffering
[1:34:28] that you go through
[1:34:31] as an individual.
[1:34:33] That's true as a church. That's true.
[1:34:38] That's why God does not come to remove
[1:34:42] all the problems to us from us as a
[1:34:45] church.
[1:34:47] Is he the owner of heaven and earth?
[1:34:52] Why doesn't he provide
[1:34:55] all the funds for our land?
[1:34:59] Why doesn't he bless brother Shalom
[1:35:04] with 400 million
[1:35:07] and brother Andrew will say I've donated
[1:35:09] to the church all of you all of you just
[1:35:12] don't worry
[1:35:14] why doesn't he bless your pastor
[1:35:17] and I provide everything
[1:35:20] because that's not how it works
[1:35:23] that's not how it works
[1:35:27] you needed to see
[1:35:30] the testimony. You'll hear the testimony
[1:35:31] of those people.
[1:35:34] Go back. I I'll share with you the
[1:35:35] YouTube uh video
[1:35:38] when they were giving the testimony on
[1:35:41] how they made their church,
[1:35:44] how from how they bought the land, the
[1:35:46] struggles they went through, the
[1:35:48] problems they went through, the the
[1:35:50] setbacks they went through, how many
[1:35:52] times it looked like it will not work,
[1:35:56] how many loans they took.
[1:35:59] from the bank from bank. How many
[1:36:02] sacrifices he made
[1:36:04] to the extent a brother in the church
[1:36:06] who had one good beautiful car, he sold
[1:36:09] it and brought the money.
[1:36:15] When I heard that, I said, "Oh God, help
[1:36:18] us to cast it."
[1:36:20] A brother, not even a deacon,
[1:36:24] not even the pastor, a brother sold his
[1:36:28] car, brought the fun for the church
[1:36:32] project.
[1:36:34] If you hear of all those things they
[1:36:36] went through,
[1:36:38] how much their pastor sacrificed,
[1:36:41] how much of his money,
[1:36:44] you know, last year we had a deficit of
[1:36:46] 30 million
[1:36:48] in our youth meeting. And so when I I
[1:36:51] said I was I was just here saying I was
[1:36:53] beginning to feel, oh God,
[1:36:56] disciple leaving all the burden for me.
[1:36:59] Okay. When I went to Zimbabwe, I'm no
[1:37:02] longer feeling like that.
[1:37:05] I'm delivered now
[1:37:07] because I had what the pastor carried.
[1:37:12] I said, "Okay, this is how it is done."
[1:37:15] Brethren,
[1:37:17] if you are a son of prosperity,
[1:37:20] God doesn't take hindrances from your
[1:37:22] face.
[1:37:25] He leaves them there so you can
[1:37:28] appreciate
[1:37:30] he that is in you.
[1:37:33] where you can understand
[1:37:35] what you are meant to be, who you are
[1:37:38] meant to be, what you are meant to
[1:37:40] accomplish.
[1:37:41] Amen. I believe by the time Joseph was
[1:37:44] in prison,
[1:37:46] he knew this is not a coincidence.
[1:37:50] How come when I reached Portifer, he
[1:37:54] gave me everything.
[1:37:56] and I'll come when I'm here. The prison
[1:37:58] guard is giving me all the
[1:38:01] I'm the one and telling the
[1:38:04] world. By this time, Joseph had begun to
[1:38:08] understand who he is.
[1:38:11] He had be to understand is not just
[1:38:14] about anybody
[1:38:16] because everybody here is a prisoner
[1:38:20] of the king of whatever it is. But who
[1:38:24] am I? a little Hebrew, not even an
[1:38:28] Egyptian like that. But I'm here and
[1:38:31] they surrendering all the authority to
[1:38:33] me.
[1:38:36] He had abilities
[1:38:38] that no one had.
[1:38:42] No one knew.
[1:38:44] He could dream and interpret his dream.
[1:38:48] He could interpret the dreams of others.
[1:38:52] He was anointed by God.
[1:38:54] Wherever he went,
[1:38:57] everything prospered.
[1:38:59] Wherever he went, everything blossomed.
[1:39:03] There is something about Joseph
[1:39:06] that has a connection with us.
[1:39:10] And that can only be because Joseph is a
[1:39:14] type of Christ.
[1:39:17] And if you remember said this mystery
[1:39:21] which has been hidden
[1:39:23] from generations for ages now has been
[1:39:28] revealed and it actually told us the
[1:39:31] mystery
[1:39:32] when he said Christ is
[1:39:35] the hope of glory.
[1:39:38] There is something about
[1:39:40] there was a glory
[1:39:43] and moved with
[1:39:45] everywhere he went there was prosperity
[1:39:49] everywhere he went there was progression
[1:39:53] he was a type of Christ
[1:39:56] and I will tell you something
[1:39:58] the bride is a part of Christ
[1:40:03] oh wait wait wait wait oh I feel so good
[1:40:06] about it the bride
[1:40:08] is not only a type of Christ,
[1:40:13] she is a part.
[1:40:15] [Applause]
[1:40:23] The Godhead
[1:40:26] is not full
[1:40:29] without you.
[1:40:33] The Godhead is not full without you.
[1:40:38] Amen. The Bible says that the fullness
[1:40:41] of Godhead bodily
[1:40:46] is in Christ.
[1:40:48] Are you following me? Is where
[1:40:52] is in Christ. Now he said what did he
[1:40:56] do? Amen. to reveal that to reveal that
[1:41:01] the mystery of Christ
[1:41:04] has three stages,
[1:41:06] three levels to it. And I'm coming back
[1:41:08] to my subject. It's all a part of it. It
[1:41:12] has three phases to it. The first one is
[1:41:16] that God
[1:41:19] was in Christ
[1:41:22] to come and redeem
[1:41:24] back, to come and save.
[1:41:27] When Jesus walked on earth,
[1:41:30] that was not just Jesus.
[1:41:33] It was God in Christ.
[1:41:36] [Music]
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God
[1:41:42] revealed.
[1:41:45] Did you get that?
[1:41:48] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:41:53] Now hear this. There was a second
[1:41:54] portion.
[1:41:57] For him he wanted to have preeminence
[1:42:02] in a body of believer
[1:42:05] the bride.
[1:42:08] Don't worry it will all come together.
[1:42:10] Just follow me. And then there he said,
[1:42:14] "Be aware lest any man
[1:42:17] spoil you
[1:42:19] through philosophy,
[1:42:22] through vain deceit,
[1:42:24] through traditions of
[1:42:26] not after Christ
[1:42:31] that they will spoil you through all
[1:42:33] traditions, through vain deceit, through
[1:42:36] philosophy, sets of beliefs that are
[1:42:40] anti
[1:42:43] not after Christ.
[1:42:46] They tell you to follow their church.
[1:42:48] They tell to follow the man, but not
[1:42:51] Christ. But you see, this message is all
[1:42:54] about Christ.
[1:42:58] It's not about a church. It's not about
[1:43:00] a denomination.
[1:43:02] It is about
[1:43:05] why because when Christ comes in you
[1:43:10] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[1:43:14] there is something that happened.
[1:43:17] It is no longer you that is living.
[1:43:21] God said my life me I'm dead.
[1:43:25] It is not I that live.
[1:43:28] It is Christ
[1:43:30] that liveth in me.
[1:43:33] So what is it? He said if I have
[1:43:35] anything to boast
[1:43:38] I boast of nothing in myself
[1:43:42] but I boast in Christ.
[1:43:47] So now when a believer is in Christ
[1:43:51] and Christ is in him
[1:43:53] there is another face. Now the first
[1:43:56] phase is Christ is the mystery of
[1:44:00] godliness.
[1:44:02] The second phase now is the bride is the
[1:44:06] mystery of
[1:44:08] Christ revealed.
[1:44:11] Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; someone is missing it.
[1:44:15] The bride. You, you, you are the mystery
[1:44:19] of Christ.
[1:44:22] Hallelujah.
[1:44:24] You are the bride coming.
[1:44:35] Lugganda is confused. Don't worry. You
[1:44:38] are the bride coming of Christ.
[1:44:46] Praise the name of the Lord. That means
[1:44:48] what? Where is now having he having
[1:44:51] preeminence in you?
[1:44:55] He ruling over you. He leading you. He
[1:44:59] guiding you. You know that's how God
[1:45:01] work
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:04] as a body of believers,
[1:45:07] as individuals, as family. You know
[1:45:10] what? God has a way he operates.
[1:45:14] He wants to be the leader
[1:45:17] in the family. He uses the husband, the
[1:45:19] father.
[1:45:21] The father must have vision,
[1:45:24] for his house,
[1:45:26] vision for his home. Are you following
[1:45:29] me? Fathers who are here and husband,
[1:45:32] you have to have a vision.
[1:45:35] What you want for your home, what you
[1:45:38] want for your father, what you you are
[1:45:40] envisioning for the future,
[1:45:43] what you are planning to accomplish,
[1:45:46] where you want to settle with your home.
[1:45:50] You know the kind of job you are doing,
[1:45:53] it has to reflect your ambition.
[1:45:56] the kind of woman you marry has to
[1:45:58] reflect your ambition or the kind of
[1:46:01] family you want to have.
[1:46:03] You know, the man has the vision
[1:46:07] for the home. But you see, the man not
[1:46:11] in himself,
[1:46:14] you know, if he's dying in himself,
[1:46:17] he's a dictator.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; I am the man of the house. I have
[1:46:24] spoken.
[1:46:28] You You are a dictator
[1:46:31] and you are not allowing Christ
[1:46:34] to have priestess
[1:46:38] in you as a husband.
[1:46:40] You as a husband, you have to pray.
[1:46:44] Find the mind of God.
[1:46:46] Hear from the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:49] And then afterwards, you come and tell
[1:46:51] your home.
[1:46:53] Sit down your wife tell her dear this is
[1:46:57] what I feel feel led to do
[1:47:00] for our home for our family for our
[1:47:04] future. If that is a good woman
[1:47:08] if you you chose well
[1:47:11] she will have the discernment
[1:47:14] to know now this is no longer my husband
[1:47:17] this is Christ
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; she will say
[1:47:23] If God is leading you,
[1:47:26] I'm right behind you.
[1:47:29] Amen.
[1:47:31] There came a woman that I was married to
[1:47:33] brother John Shar
[1:47:36] who suffered for years
[1:47:38] and I want to finish at 12:30. So,
[1:47:41] and you know I keep time so I even if
[1:47:43] I'm not done I'll just finish.
[1:47:45] John Sheret,
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; John Sher uh had you know they had
[1:47:49] suffered with his wife
[1:47:51] for years
[1:47:53] beating stones on the road and making
[1:47:55] money and then eventually they made some
[1:47:59] money and bought a house,
[1:48:02] renovated it and moved it
[1:48:05] and then in the night the Lord spoke to
[1:48:07] him.
[1:48:09] God is a God of order.
[1:48:12] He spoke to the man
[1:48:15] cuz it's the head of the house.
[1:48:19] You sister, you have to submit to
[1:48:21] headship.
[1:48:24] But you man, you also have to submit to
[1:48:27] headship
[1:48:30] because the headship is Christ.
[1:48:33] Not you as you in your own wisdom
[1:48:38] leading your home. That home will
[1:48:41] crumble.
[1:48:43] That home will be destroyed.
[1:48:46] But a man must hear from. A man must
[1:48:49] have a connection with the head.
[1:48:52] The head of every man is
[1:48:55] Christ. The head of every woman is the
[1:49:02] scripture. And right there, John Charity
[1:49:05] told the wife, you know, the wife, the
[1:49:09] Lord visited me the night and told me
[1:49:12] there's a preacher in town
[1:49:14] and we should give our house
[1:49:18] to him.
[1:49:20] We should carry our uh clothes
[1:49:24] and we should empty our closet
[1:49:28] and we clothes only
[1:49:31] and we leave the rest for him
[1:49:35] and we leave the rest for him.
[1:49:37] You have to always listen
[1:49:41] from the Holy Spirit.
[1:49:46] And I remember when we were leaving,
[1:49:47] when we were going to Ethiopia,
[1:49:50] you know, we we gave away everything we
[1:49:52] had, the way it was
[1:49:55] to to to a young family.
[1:49:57] Not that we had a lot, but the Lord
[1:50:00] ministered to us
[1:50:02] to do it. When we returned to Uganda,
[1:50:05] having given it all out, we had nothing.
[1:50:09] that if the Holy Spirit has led you
[1:50:12] to do something,
[1:50:14] you can never suffer
[1:50:17] and brother John Sher
[1:50:20] what he did he gave her away everything
[1:50:22] and and and he had nothing
[1:50:26] he and his wife went back to the streets
[1:50:29] follow closely
[1:50:31] after a while being on the streets a
[1:50:34] woman finds her and says I'll take you
[1:50:37] to my house and as long as you can take
[1:50:39] care of my garden,
[1:50:42] I I I'll give you a place to stay in my
[1:50:45] garage and everything.
[1:50:47] After a while, God ministers to this
[1:50:50] woman
[1:50:52] in a dream and says to her, "Give John
[1:50:57] Sheret,
[1:50:59] not charity. Charity
[1:51:03] char
[1:51:06] $5,000.
[1:51:09] as alone.
[1:51:11] God is amazing.
[1:51:14] God is a God of drama.
[1:51:16] He didn't even say give him as a
[1:51:17] donation.
[1:51:19] But as alone yet for him, he gave his
[1:51:21] house
[1:51:23] because God knew what was coming.
[1:51:26] When you give to the work of God, don't
[1:51:30] think mechanically.
[1:51:34] Don't ever give because you excited.
[1:51:38] When there is a need, listen to the Holy
[1:51:41] Spirit. What will you have me to do?
[1:51:46] Sometimes when you're excited, you will
[1:51:49] give 500,000.
[1:51:51] You will pledge it, you will never give
[1:51:53] it.
[1:51:54] But when you hear from the Holy Ghost,
[1:51:57] he can tell you 5 million.
[1:52:00] It is completely out of your mind. You
[1:52:03] can't do it.
[1:52:05] You don't have the ability. It's not
[1:52:08] from you. It is from Christ. You know
[1:52:11] what? He has a way to make it happen.
[1:52:16] We must allow the Holy Spirit to have
[1:52:19] preeminence in us.
[1:52:21] And John Sher
[1:52:24] gave and he was given this loan of
[1:52:27] $5,000.
[1:52:29] So he took this money and as they was
[1:52:32] walking down the street, they found a
[1:52:34] house, a old house.
[1:52:37] They bought it together with the wife.
[1:52:39] They renovated it and they sold I think
[1:52:42] $10,000.
[1:52:44] Made made an interest there. Got another
[1:52:47] house. Got another house. Got another
[1:52:49] house. Who was giving them those houses
[1:52:53] to make profits from?
[1:52:55] The same God who are left.
[1:53:00] Brother, let me tell you, God is not a
[1:53:04] liar.
[1:53:06] And if the Holy Spirit leads you,
[1:53:09] he will never lead you astray.
[1:53:13] In your home, as a husband, as a family,
[1:53:18] let God lead your father.
[1:53:21] Children, allow God to use your father.
[1:53:26] allow him to hear from the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:31] And as long as it is him, Christ,
[1:53:34] Christ can never lead you.
[1:53:37] Wives, let your husbands lead you.
[1:53:42] As long as you know you married a
[1:53:43] Christian,
[1:53:48] that's why you must marry Christian.
[1:53:51] If you get married to a Muslim,
[1:53:54] or someone from some denomination. They
[1:53:57] don't even know anything about Christ's
[1:53:58] leadership.
[1:54:01] How would they guide your home? She will
[1:54:04] tell you, I want you to dress in
[1:54:09] this how he's like and the word says
[1:54:12] submit your husband
[1:54:14] and then you will be coming pastor. You
[1:54:16] don't have to obey my husband.
[1:54:19] The problem was the choice you made.
[1:54:22] Do not make a choice to marry an
[1:54:24] unbeliever.
[1:54:26] Get to marry to a believer who can lead
[1:54:29] you with the mind of Christ.
[1:54:32] [Music]
[1:54:34] Let me tell you brother, sister, a
[1:54:36] family that is led by Christ
[1:54:39] can never crumble.
[1:54:42] That's like Joseph could not crumble.
[1:54:45] You can put him here. Put him there. He
[1:54:49] could not crumble
[1:54:51] because he had an unseen leader.
[1:54:55] He had one that was unseen
[1:54:59] leading him all the way.
[1:55:03] Hallelujah. If husbands are led by God,
[1:55:06] if fathers are led by God, we are going
[1:55:09] to have strong families.
[1:55:14] Amen. And it comes from the home
[1:55:19] to the church.
[1:55:21] If homes are rebellious,
[1:55:24] even churches will be rebellious.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the problem.
[1:55:30] We must have a church that is led by the
[1:55:33] Holy Ghost. But just like in the home,
[1:55:37] not everybody says, "I've heard from
[1:55:39] God. Let us do this."
[1:55:43] God comes through his godgiven channel,
[1:55:49] the head of the house. Even in the local
[1:55:52] church,
[1:55:55] he blesses a local minister,
[1:55:59] a local elder,
[1:56:02] a local pastor.
[1:56:05] That is not only in our church, in every
[1:56:07] church of Christ.
[1:56:11] Praise the name of the Lord. And that's
[1:56:14] why brother Bham says, you can never go
[1:56:16] any higher than your pastor.
[1:56:20] Meaning if your pastor has this much
[1:56:24] revelation,
[1:56:27] you cannot go higher than it.
[1:56:31] So if your pastor has a big revelation,
[1:56:32] you'll have a big re.
[1:56:35] If your pastor has a small revelation,
[1:56:38] you will have a small revelation.
[1:56:41] That's how it is. That's why you have to
[1:56:43] be careful when choosing a local church
[1:56:46] to attend.
[1:56:49] If you find a church where a pastor
[1:56:51] always brags,
[1:56:53] oh, I'm the one who did it. They cannot
[1:56:56] do it without me.
[1:56:58] I'm better than all the pastors.
[1:57:01] Sometimes they may not say directly,
[1:57:03] but they do things to imply
[1:57:07] that if you are not following them, you
[1:57:08] are lost. That oh, they are the ones who
[1:57:11] are gifted to heal or to do this. You
[1:57:14] will soon find the people have have the
[1:57:17] same spirit.
[1:57:20] They're burgatory.
[1:57:24] They feel they're the ones who have got
[1:57:25] it.
[1:57:27] You see, when you when you you have a a
[1:57:29] pastor a church
[1:57:31] that has a pastor that just does things
[1:57:35] without hearing from God,
[1:57:38] you'll find families and people, young
[1:57:40] people, everybody following the same
[1:57:42] trend.
[1:57:44] If you find a pastor that doesn't study
[1:57:46] the word,
[1:57:48] doesn't pray, doesn't, you know, you
[1:57:51] will find a church doing the same thing,
[1:57:54] good or bad,
[1:57:56] are you following? If you find a church
[1:57:59] where a pastor never worships, doesn't
[1:58:01] know how to worship,
[1:58:04] it is impossible to find the people
[1:58:06] worship.
[1:58:07] So these things are true. It is the way
[1:58:10] of God. And so what does it mean? The
[1:58:14] Bible says the choosing of a bride.
[1:58:17] So it is when you're choosing a church,
[1:58:21] you have to pray. You have to wait upon
[1:58:24] God. He has to lead you in those things.
[1:58:27] And I want to believe all of you who are
[1:58:29] at DV
[1:58:31] are led by the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:34] Sometimes we have brethren coming from
[1:58:36] other churches
[1:58:38] and you know they say, "Well, I want to
[1:58:39] make this my church.
[1:58:42] You know, it's all right. Those things
[1:58:43] are good. But sometimes there are many
[1:58:46] reasons why they
[1:58:48] maybe sometimes they kicked out of their
[1:58:50] church
[1:58:52] for living in a wrong kind of life
[1:58:55] or they were just not serious people.
[1:59:00] And so sometimes we as pastors, we we
[1:59:03] smile when someone says, "I want to make
[1:59:06] this my church." But before you know it,
[1:59:10] you experiencing a lot of trouble with
[1:59:11] that person
[1:59:14] and then
[1:59:16] that's why they left that
[1:59:18] when it is already too late. Let me tell
[1:59:21] you church, we all must be led by the
[1:59:24] Holy Spirit.
[1:59:26] We must choose our church
[1:59:29] by the Holy Spirit lead.
[1:59:32] And when God leads you,
[1:59:35] stay with his leadership.
[1:59:38] Because God can never lead you astray.
[1:59:44] And when he leads you into a local
[1:59:45] church,
[1:59:47] don't go there while he's aching all the
[1:59:48] time
[1:59:50] thinking you know how it should be done.
[1:59:53] All the pastor is doing it wrong. God
[1:59:55] will minister to that pastor
[1:59:58] to give the church spiritual food in
[2:00:00] this season
[2:00:02] but also give them direction and how
[2:00:04] they should go.
[2:00:08] You know, I remember here not long ago
[2:00:10] when we had um you know trying to you
[2:00:13] know collect funds for the church and
[2:00:16] and you know it was not working and one
[2:00:19] time I was in my office
[2:00:21] became like real to me how we should do
[2:00:24] fundraising and everything and I came
[2:00:26] and told you and now three years later
[2:00:31] looks long right
[2:00:33] three years
[2:00:36] We have a land.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; We succeeded.
[2:00:45] We prospered.
[2:00:48] Why did that mind prosper?
[2:00:52] Because it was not my mind.
[2:00:54] It was the mind of God.
[2:00:57] It was the leadership of Christ.
[2:01:00] Let me tell you, if you want to go far
[2:01:01] with God,
[2:01:03] we should come to a place where we see
[2:01:06] beyond the people.
[2:01:11] Be a little fast, brother. Where you see
[2:01:13] beyond man,
[2:01:15] where you see beyond me, the person, you
[2:01:17] see beyond your husband, you see beyond
[2:01:20] someone and then you see Christ.
[2:01:23] If you know it is Christ speaking
[2:01:26] whatever the leadership he has given to
[2:01:28] us we are going to rally behind
[2:01:32] as long as it is leading us to stay with
[2:01:34] the word.
[2:01:37] Praise the name of the Lord. You see
[2:01:40] this is how God brings about prosperity
[2:01:45] as long as the church is following after
[2:01:48] Christ.
[2:01:50] not a man but Christ. And you know he
[2:01:53] speaks about um like I said maybe on
[2:01:55] Wednesday I'll get a little bit into
[2:01:57] details
[2:01:59] but um he speaks of on the sea in
[2:02:03] chapter 3 14 of revelation and unto the
[2:02:07] angel of the church right
[2:02:11] these things say the amen
[2:02:14] the faithful and true witness the
[2:02:16] beginning of the creation of God
[2:02:19] know thy works
[2:02:21] that thou had neither cold or hot,
[2:02:24] I would thou cold or hot.
[2:02:28] So then, because thou art lukewarm,
[2:02:31] and neither cold nor hot,
[2:02:34] I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[2:02:38] Because thou sayest,
[2:02:41] you say, God is saying, I didn't say you
[2:02:44] are,
[2:02:46] but you say, I am rich. I am increased
[2:02:50] with goods. and have need of nothing.
[2:02:53] But then what is the opinion of God?
[2:02:56] God says, "But I know
[2:03:00] you are wretched,
[2:03:03] miserable, poor, blind, naked."
[2:03:07] And then he said, "But I counseled thee,
[2:03:10] and by of me God tried in the fire
[2:03:13] that you may be rich, and with Raymond,
[2:03:16] that thou may be clothed,
[2:03:19] that the shame of your nakedness not
[2:03:20] appear.
[2:03:23] and anoint thy eyes with thyself
[2:03:26] that thou mayest see.
[2:03:29] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:31] Now friends, I want us to hear these
[2:03:34] words
[2:03:35] in the next few minutes here. But says
[2:03:38] in the church 8, he says, "Now anybody
[2:03:41] knows that it is a lukewarm water that
[2:03:44] makes you sick at the stomach.
[2:03:48] If you need to vomit,
[2:03:50] lukewarm is about the best thing to
[2:03:52] drink.
[2:03:54] A lukewarm church has made God sick
[2:03:58] and he has and he has declared he will
[2:04:00] spew it out.
[2:04:03] Reminds us how he felt just before the
[2:04:05] flood, doesn't it?
[2:04:09] Would the go would to go the church were
[2:04:11] cold or hot?
[2:04:15] Best of all, she should be fed.
[2:04:19] May TVF be hot,
[2:04:22] hot in vision, hot with vision, hot with
[2:04:26] mission,
[2:04:28] hot with purpose.
[2:04:32] You know, we are not building a system
[2:04:34] or an organization.
[2:04:37] We have a vision, brother.
[2:04:39] If you did not know, we have a vision.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; We have an assignment in this ministry.
[2:04:48] And our assignment is to reach this
[2:04:50] generation
[2:04:52] with this message of the hour
[2:04:55] to bring about a restoration
[2:04:59] returning back again
[2:05:01] to the fathers of our faith.
[2:05:05] And you see this vision, this assignment
[2:05:10] is right in the middle of the word.
[2:05:14] And I can tell you what, brother. It
[2:05:16] will prosper.
[2:05:19] I say it will prosper.
[2:05:23] It will prosper.
[2:05:27] It will succeed. It will go on. And I
[2:05:31] can prove that to you. It is going on
[2:05:35] because you are here. You are not here
[2:05:37] by accident.
[2:05:39] Because of this assignment, you are
[2:05:41] here.
[2:05:43] I am here. We are all here because there
[2:05:46] is something for us to do.
[2:05:50] When God plants you somewhere,
[2:05:53] don't just move around. Put your hands
[2:05:56] to something.
[2:05:58] Get something doing.
[2:06:00] Be a man, a woman of vision.
[2:06:04] Don't be a mediocre.
[2:06:08] Like the sister said, she's been
[2:06:10] revived. She has now understood there is
[2:06:13] a purpose. There is a cause for every
[2:06:17] woman, every man. Let me tell there is
[2:06:20] no little one among us.
[2:06:23] We all can do something.
[2:06:25] I said we all can do something.
[2:06:29] Amen. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:06:34] M
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; you see we have to be hot but you see
[2:06:39] the church is not and s has been passed
[2:06:44] she's no longer God's voice to the world
[2:06:48] she will maintain that she is but she
[2:06:50] God says she's not
[2:06:54] and you see friends the bride is God's
[2:06:57] voice today
[2:06:59] God said she's no longer God's voice
[2:07:03] and he said the bride is
[2:07:06] you are God's voice today.
[2:07:11] The the bride coming of Christ.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; So when you speak, it's not you
[2:07:19] speaking, it is Christ.
[2:07:23] Hallelujah. Now look at the first phrase
[2:07:27] of this verse because thou sayest. See
[2:07:30] they were speaking. They were talking as
[2:07:33] the mouthpiece of God.
[2:07:36] But though they say it, that does not
[2:07:39] make it right.
[2:07:42] The Catholic Church says she speaks for
[2:07:44] God.
[2:07:45] Saying she is the assured voice of the
[2:07:47] Lord.
[2:07:49] How any people can be so spiritually
[2:07:51] wicked is more than I know.
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:56] But they produce according to the seed
[2:07:58] which is in them.
[2:08:01] They yes they produce their results
[2:08:06] and we know where that seed came from
[2:08:11] don't we? But we also know the seed
[2:08:13] which is in us.
[2:08:15] Amen. It is the spoken word seed of God.
[2:08:21] That seed cannot die.
[2:08:25] So when you when you talk about Joseph,
[2:08:28] you're talking about Christ,
[2:08:31] Christ was a son of prosecution.
[2:08:34] And the Bible say one day he's going to
[2:08:37] come back
[2:08:39] and the earth will blossom
[2:08:43] with prosperity.
[2:08:45] He will rule. Amen. This earth and he
[2:08:48] will be the king of prosperity.
[2:08:52] You have had America
[2:08:54] saying that oh Trump said he's going to
[2:08:57] bring forth the golden age of America.
[2:09:01] He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[2:09:03] He cannot do it. He cannot do. Why?
[2:09:06] Because that is a work of Christ.
[2:09:10] And he's going to do it in the
[2:09:11] millennium.
[2:09:13] The millennium is going to be a golden
[2:09:16] age.
[2:09:18] A golden age.
[2:09:20] Oh, glory to God.
[2:09:23] Where everything shall be perfect.
[2:09:27] No sick will be there. No blind will be
[2:09:30] there. No lamb will be there. We shall
[2:09:33] all be in Hallelujah.
[2:09:37] Hallelujah rejoicing night and day
[2:09:40] because we shall be with the son of
[2:09:41] prosperity.
[2:09:43] But even today the Bible says we are
[2:09:47] seated in the heavenly blessing with a
[2:09:51] son of prosperity.
[2:09:55] Hallelujah. Even before we get there,
[2:09:58] everything we do now, it must progress.
[2:10:04] Oh, why do we do things that do not
[2:10:07] progress? Because God never spoke to us.
[2:10:11] He didn't speak to you.
[2:10:13] You ran.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell you to do. You paid.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; God have mercy upon us.
[2:10:21] From me to everybody here.
[2:10:24] We must learn to hear from the spirit.
[2:10:28] Even when it comes to the house you want
[2:10:30] to rent,
[2:10:32] even the place where you want to rent,
[2:10:35] ask the Lord.
[2:10:38] You know what? You don't need to wait
[2:10:39] for a dream or a vision or something.
[2:10:43] But you know he will lead you. He has a
[2:10:46] way of leading every one of us.
[2:10:49] He will speak to you. Even the school
[2:10:52] you are going to attend.
[2:10:55] Even the man you're going to get married
[2:10:56] to. Even the woman you're going to get
[2:10:58] married to. Okay? Even if he's an
[2:11:01] unbeliever,
[2:11:03] I have something for you. Some of you
[2:11:05] who are hooked with an unbelievers,
[2:11:10] forget about the message.
[2:11:12] Do you love the Lord? If you love the
[2:11:14] Lord, go in prayer and speak to the
[2:11:17] Lord. If you love the Lord in your
[2:11:19] heart, he will tell you no or yes.
[2:11:24] If he tells you yes, go ahead.
[2:11:27] Amen. One time he told a prophet, "Yes,
[2:11:31] he married a prostitute."
[2:11:34] So many you are one of those.
[2:11:38] But if it is the mind of God, he will
[2:11:41] never forsake you. He will never leave
[2:11:44] you. But I want to be in the perfect
[2:11:48] will of God.
[2:11:51] And the perfect will
[2:11:53] never lead me away from what they watch.
[2:12:00] Amen. But when you choose the mind of
[2:12:02] God. When you choose the will of God,
[2:12:06] you will progress, you will prosper, you
[2:12:09] will go forward, everything will work
[2:12:12] out for you.
[2:12:14] [Applause]
[2:12:16] Why don't we ask the Lord?
[2:12:19] Because we are afraid.
[2:12:21] We don't think he will answer.
[2:12:25] I challenge each of you here.
[2:12:28] How many have sincerely prayed over
[2:12:30] something to wait upon the Lord
[2:12:34] before you made a major decision?
[2:12:39] You don't need to lift up your hand. But
[2:12:41] you know, if you think about it, you're
[2:12:43] like, "When was that? I don't remember.
[2:12:48] Have I ever done it?"
[2:12:51] Maybe.
[2:12:53] No. Let me tell you what it is.
[2:12:55] You don't believe,
[2:12:58] you have no faith.
[2:13:00] That's why you fear to ask the Lord.
[2:13:06] You know, I remember when I was going to
[2:13:08] get married to my wife.
[2:13:11] It was a very uh tight tight tight
[2:13:15] moment and I don't usually speak these
[2:13:16] things
[2:13:19] except in private to a few people
[2:13:23] but you know I was already looped with
[2:13:24] another sister
[2:13:27] and um I thought that she was the one. I
[2:13:30] had I will not go in the details of this
[2:13:32] testimony,
[2:13:33] but later on I got signs that showed she
[2:13:37] was she probably was not the one.
[2:13:41] and and and and and then I I I I I saw
[2:13:43] somebody that I thought that I loved.
[2:13:45] And
[2:13:48] you know, when you are young and you you
[2:13:51] just want to get married and
[2:13:53] you just want to move on with your life,
[2:13:56] you're not too sure what is the will of
[2:13:59] God.
[2:14:01] You're not too sure.
[2:14:03] And that's how I was.
[2:14:05] I wasn't too sure.
[2:14:08] And then then this other one,
[2:14:11] you know, we started talking, but I
[2:14:13] wasn't too sure also.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; I wasn't too sure.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; So I told my brother, where is my
[2:14:19] brother?
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Right over here.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; He's a witness. Cuz he was he was
[2:14:25] somebody I was taking care of in my
[2:14:27] house.
[2:14:29] And so I told him, I want you to escort
[2:14:31] me. I'm going somewhere to pray.
[2:14:35] And I told my pastor, I I I'm I'm
[2:14:38] leaving. I'm going somewhere to to pray.
[2:14:41] And we had a house there.
[2:14:45] Uh so we I packed up my bag. The way I
[2:14:48] packed was I was determined.
[2:14:52] I'll be there for a week, for two, for a
[2:14:53] month until God speaks. Because I was
[2:14:57] desperate.
[2:14:59] I did not want to break anyone's heart,
[2:15:02] but I wanted to be right with God. I
[2:15:05] wanted to be sure I have done the will
[2:15:07] of God and I didn't want to marry
[2:15:10] somebody because I'm excited either.
[2:15:13] So, I went before the Lord. But before I
[2:15:16] went, I told this girl,
[2:15:19] I said, "I'm sorry." And this is long
[2:15:21] after I had left the other one and
[2:15:24] and then now I was talking to this one
[2:15:27] who happens to be my wife today. And so
[2:15:30] I told her, I said, "Sister Rebecca, I
[2:15:32] have something to tell you." I always
[2:15:34] called her dear. So when she had
[2:15:36] Rebecca, I'm sure she must have been
[2:15:38] surprised.
[2:15:40] I have something to tell you.
[2:15:44] I would like us to call it off for now.
[2:15:47] Let us be friends, but we will not talk
[2:15:50] as we've been talking.
[2:15:52] Give me some time because I want to go
[2:15:54] and pray
[2:15:56] and be sure.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; That was dreadful for her.
[2:16:04] And so, but I did it anyhow because I
[2:16:07] wanted to be sure.
[2:16:09] pray something
[2:16:12] about knowing you are in the perfect
[2:16:14] will of God.
[2:16:20] So I went with with Peter.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; We went to the house. At that time there
[2:16:25] was nobody
[2:16:27] and uh this is very personal for me
[2:16:29] friends.
[2:16:31] And um so we went and but you know God
[2:16:34] sees your heart.
[2:16:36] The very first night
[2:16:42] God spoke to me.
[2:16:45] You can't believe it.
[2:16:48] I I took my Bible
[2:16:51] before I even I think we had just prayed
[2:16:53] the first prayer just to arrive in the
[2:16:55] consecrated place
[2:16:58] and then I I took the Bible
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; and read in the book of Jeremiah.
[2:17:05] The Lord spoke to me
[2:17:08] so directly
[2:17:10] [Music]
[2:17:12] and gave me all the I don't have time to
[2:17:14] go through all the details.
[2:17:16] If you want my testimony, come
[2:17:19] and and spoke everything to me.
[2:17:23] And so I I began shouting Peter was
[2:17:28] crying and shouting.
[2:17:30] I told him God has spoken.
[2:17:33] Let me tell you this this written word
[2:17:38] can become a Rama.
[2:17:44] God ministered to me just like that
[2:17:49] and I knew what the will of God was. So
[2:17:52] when I came back later and told my
[2:17:55] fiance that you know let's resume
[2:17:58] she was already broken in heart. She
[2:18:01] told me I'm sorry I don't trust you
[2:18:03] anymore.
[2:18:05] Now that was another problem because God
[2:18:08] has now confirmed to me the reason why
[2:18:11] she was not trusting anymore because God
[2:18:14] had spoken to her before
[2:18:17] and she was sure but I was not
[2:18:22] be sure on your own sister be sure
[2:18:26] let God speak to you
[2:18:30] because if he doesn't and you make a
[2:18:33] wrong choice wrong decision
[2:18:35] you regret the rest of your life
[2:18:38] to walk out of his will.
[2:18:42] But anyways, I think I'm blessed with
[2:18:44] words.
[2:18:46] And so she she could not she got she got
[2:18:49] conquered.
[2:18:52] And she said, "Okay,
[2:18:55] okay, let us continue."
[2:18:58] So then I got I got engaged and and
[2:19:02] the rest is history. We've lived for
[2:19:05] together for 12 years
[2:19:07] and I can tell you I do not regret.
[2:19:11] I don't regret
[2:19:14] there are times
[2:19:17] that I have seen and I say ah
[2:19:22] she was the right
[2:19:26] brothers who are married know what I'm
[2:19:27] talking about.
[2:19:30] Men can be difficult,
[2:19:33] but the way you are,
[2:19:35] there is a woman for you
[2:19:38] who can manage you the way you are.
[2:19:44] But if you go and marry somebody,
[2:19:47] that's not the will of God.
[2:19:51] You will break up
[2:19:53] so fast
[2:19:56] faster than lightning.
[2:19:59] And may God help us
[2:20:01] to desire
[2:20:04] the will.
[2:20:07] Because if you walk in the will of God,
[2:20:10] I can tell you'll prosper.
[2:20:13] And the will of God is the word of God.
[2:20:17] The will cannot go out outside of the
[2:20:19] world.
[2:20:22] And if you are in the word, you will
[2:20:24] always prosper.
[2:20:26] Always prosper.
[2:20:29] Now, that's just one page of my sermon.
[2:20:33] And I hope I don't preach this for
[2:20:34] several services.
[2:20:37] I'll finish it on Wednesday. I don't
[2:20:38] know.
[2:20:39] So, let us stand on our feet.
[2:20:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:20:48] Money
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; is not what does the ministry.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; God moves by his spirit,
[2:20:58] not by the amount of money or talent.
[2:21:03] May that go into your heart
[2:21:06] to understand
[2:21:08] whatever you you are, whatever you have
[2:21:12] is all.
[2:21:15] by the Lord and for the Lord
[2:21:19] and you want to have him lead you.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:21:27] Let us all bow our heads.
[2:21:31] Uh the service went in the direction
[2:21:33] that according to your needs
[2:21:38] because there are many things I said I
[2:21:40] wasn't planning to say.
[2:21:44] But God has a way
[2:21:47] to turn the preacher
[2:21:50] and make him exact say exactly what the
[2:21:52] people need.
[2:21:54] So while you you have your heads back,
[2:21:58] ask the Lord,
[2:22:00] what's your will for my life?
[2:22:03] What would you have me to do?
[2:22:07] Tell him silently in your heart.
[2:22:10] Lord, lead me.
[2:22:13] I don't know if the sisters sister
[2:22:17] patience and the others can sing that
[2:22:19] song.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Lead me Lord and I'll follow.
[2:22:25] Lead me Lord, I'll call.
[2:22:29] You have called me. I will answer. Lead
[2:22:32] me Lord and I'll go.
[2:22:37] Ask him in your heart.
[2:22:40] Even regarding all the projects we have
[2:22:42] for the church
[2:22:45] and many things, a lot of needs, but I
[2:22:48] am I'm determined friends
[2:22:52] to follow the leadership of the Holy
[2:22:53] Spirit.
[2:22:55] Even when it comes to the youth camp,
[2:22:58] I thought I should stop it.
[2:23:01] But the Holy Spirit ministered to me. It
[2:23:04] is his will for us to continue with it
[2:23:08] because it is our assignment.
[2:23:12] What are you going to do about it?
[2:23:17] What are you going to do about it?
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:30] You have called me
[2:23:33] [Music]
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; I will answer

[2:26:21] me here for a purpose.

[2:26:27] I don't want to do it.
[2:26:30] I want to be led by the Holy Spirit
[2:26:34] because I know you will prosper me
[2:26:39] if I follow your leadership.
[2:26:42] You will prosper me.
[2:26:44] You will increase me.

[2:46:29] [Music]
[2:46:35] I got my
[2:46:38] I got my
[2:46:41] This is my
[2:46:47] praise.
[2:46:59] Praise God. Oh God.
[2:47:06] Oh my God.
[2:47:10] Hallelujah.
[2:47:16] God is able.
[2:47:20] God is able.
[2:47:24] Tell your neighbor, "God is able."
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; God is able, my brother.
[2:47:29] We are more than able.
[2:47:33] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:47:36] &gt;&gt; Because we have the son of prosperity
[2:47:40] in our midst.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; Who is he? He's the one.
[2:47:46] Hallelujah. The revealed word of the
[2:47:48] earth.
[2:47:50] The devil can't take us in a tomb
[2:47:52] somewhere
[2:47:55] and cover us there. We are the bride of
[2:47:57] Christ.
[2:47:59] We are the bride coming of Christ.
[2:48:02] The devil can't.
[2:48:10] [Music]
[2:48:13] Amen.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; Can you give it a little shout?
[2:48:16] Hallelujah.
[2:48:18] Glory.
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[2:48:25] Praise the Lord.
[2:48:27] &gt;&gt; As Isaac is preparing to come,
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; he's going to have he has a slideshow
[2:48:33] and a few words. He is he's going to
[2:48:34] speak to us regarding the youth camp.
[2:48:42] He's helping us with that part of the
[2:48:44] youth camp
[2:48:50] uh to budget and fundraising and all
[2:48:52] that.
[2:48:54] But I just wanted to let you know
[2:48:58] that in case you don't know,
[2:49:00] we already have our church.
[2:49:04] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:49:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. If you have not seen it, ask
[2:49:09] anybody.
[2:49:13] Know where it is and take it.
[2:49:15] And um we will go um we will we will
[2:49:19] even go and try to
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; how do they call it?
[2:49:36] Okay, he's interrupted me, but I'm going
[2:49:38] to give him the
[2:49:41] one minute.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; I felt I wouldn't leave without giving.
[2:49:48] I think before pastor left,
[2:49:51] I had a need
[2:49:53] and I had money
[2:49:56] but wasn't enough.
[2:49:59] So I came and prayed.
[2:50:01] I remember I knelt here and I said
[2:50:04] I have this money but cannot solve my
[2:50:07] problem.
[2:50:09] I said I'm going to give it to the land
[2:50:11] farm.
[2:50:13] And when I went to pastor
[2:50:15] because I work with him he said done are
[2:50:19] you excited
[2:50:21] I I told him pastor I know what I'm
[2:50:23] saying
[2:50:25] was the only man I was remaining
[2:50:28] but I said if God enabled the the people
[2:50:32] that were giving in their lives he will
[2:50:35] give me that grace maybe I don't know
[2:50:37] what he wants to teach me but
[2:50:42] I gave it out all
[2:50:45] I didn't know what next
[2:50:47] but from that day clients kept coming
[2:50:52] even up to now I still receive money
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you God bless you God bless
[2:51:00] you he supplies he supplies rims of
[2:51:03] papers to schools
[2:51:06] before he was going to schools and they
[2:51:07] are telling uh him uh no
[2:51:13] But after when he came to me I said I
[2:51:16] just excited all you speak he said I'm
[2:51:19] late to do it I said it's all right you
[2:51:23] know and he gave that money towards the
[2:51:26] land fun
[2:51:28] and uh since then
[2:51:30] he's telling me oh I've got this client
[2:51:32] oh I've got this oh I've got this God is
[2:51:35] able
[2:51:38] but the Holy Spirit must lead you
[2:51:44] and I can tell you for sure if there is
[2:51:46] a need
[2:51:48] he can never lead you to give nothing
[2:51:53] he doesn't lead that way he's a supplier
[2:51:57] the provider of all that we have need of
[2:52:00] because Jehovah Gyra
[2:52:02] when he leads you he leads you when you
[2:52:04] have nothing
[2:52:06] he led Abraham that's why Abraham never
[2:52:09] spoke to Sarah
[2:52:11] Because if she spoke to Sarah, Sarah
[2:52:14] would have told him, "You are crazy. You
[2:52:17] can't do that. God, it's not even
[2:52:20] biblical
[2:52:22] asking for a human life."
[2:52:26] So he followed the leadership of God.
[2:52:30] But you see, he believed
[2:52:33] and he created.
[2:52:35] When you give something to the Lord,
[2:52:38] create.
[2:52:40] He created
[2:52:42] that lamp. You think it was God who
[2:52:44] created it? It was Abraham.
[2:52:49] If you're a good Bible reader, you will
[2:52:50] know that
[2:52:52] right down the mountain. He told
[2:52:56] the little boy said, "We have firewood.
[2:53:00] Where's the sacrifice? God will provide
[2:53:03] for you."
[2:53:06] He why didn't he say you are the
[2:53:07] sacrifice?
[2:53:09] He believed God was going to provide
[2:53:14] a sacrifice. So, brethren, let us do
[2:53:18] things by faith.
[2:53:23] Sure. Let's continue with this, brother.
[2:53:25] Let's continue with this. I figure let's
[2:53:27] just continue with this because several
[2:53:28] of our of our people are not here and
[2:53:30] it's all right. If those who want to
[2:53:32] listen to what we are doing and they
[2:53:34] want to uh spy on our liberty, that's
[2:53:36] all right.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; So they're asking me whether they should
[2:53:39] continue with this training.
[2:53:43] Amen. Amen. Because these things are
[2:53:45] also for a testimony.
[2:53:47] I always hear from others, oh I was
[2:53:49] encouraged.
[2:53:52] There's a brother in New Zealand who
[2:53:53] told me I was encouraged
[2:53:56] by
[2:53:59] Right now we started a church.
[2:54:02] So these things it encourages others.
[2:54:06] Um so um I wanted to let you know we now
[2:54:10] have our land
[2:54:13] and um we should give the Lord a clap of
[2:54:15] praise for that.
[2:54:17] [Music]
[2:54:18] Amen.
[2:54:21] So we can even go and put a fence around
[2:54:23] it.
[2:54:26] We can clear the ground.
[2:54:28] We can um use it for someone said
[2:54:32] cultivation. I'm not going to use it for
[2:54:33] cultivation
[2:54:36] [Music]
[2:54:37] because we want to use it to build our
[2:54:39] church.
[2:54:41] So
[2:54:43] um we have paid 100 million as of today
[2:54:48] and um we are remaining with 120
[2:54:51] million.
[2:54:54] Give me that picture again brother. God
[2:54:56] was so gracious with us.
[2:54:58] God was so gracious with us. I went with
[2:55:01] brother Mul
[2:55:03] [Music]
[2:55:04] brother
[2:55:07] Daniel.
[2:55:10] Who else? Raise up your hand if you
[2:55:16] so are the ones who are around and they
[2:55:18] could quickly come and represent us. So
[2:55:21] we went of course as you know we were
[2:55:23] supposed to pay uh the balance in 8
[2:55:26] months.
[2:55:28] But we had a tight negotiation with a
[2:55:30] gentleman
[2:55:33] and he agreed that we can pay it in 12
[2:55:35] months
[2:55:38] in 12 months.
[2:55:40] And uh so that is a very very good
[2:55:42] thing.
[2:55:44] But my plan is if the Lord blesses us
[2:55:48] and we clear this in 6 months
[2:55:52] you know then we can go ahead and begin
[2:55:55] develop like moving we can plan to move
[2:56:00] in the other six months.
[2:56:02] Um of course um there have been plans
[2:56:08] and thoughts from some quarters of
[2:56:10] taking along
[2:56:14] of taking a loan.
[2:56:17] But when they gave us 12 months,
[2:56:20] we all agreed among ourselves, those who
[2:56:22] were there, that it's not even
[2:56:25] necessary to take a loan.
[2:56:28] If we work together
[2:56:31] and uh with a with with a united mind,
[2:56:35] [Music]
[2:56:37] we are more than able
[2:56:42] You don't have the money. I know. I'm
[2:56:44] your pastor. I know.
[2:56:46] Um I you you don't have the money to pay
[2:56:49] did in six months.
[2:56:52] But God is able
[2:56:54] to provide a sacrifice.
[2:56:57] We've seen this testimony. We've heard
[2:57:00] and other testimonies we've heard
[2:57:01] before.
[2:57:03] So give, it shall be given to you. Don't
[2:57:06] promise anything by excitement.
[2:57:12] You are hearing we have 120 million.
[2:57:16] How much of it can you lessen the
[2:57:18] burden?
[2:57:22] You as a concerned member of the board.
[2:57:27] Well, some of you can give 10 million,
[2:57:30] others 20, others five,
[2:57:33] others one, others three, depending on
[2:57:37] your faith.
[2:57:39] Not your ability.
[2:57:41] Your ability is not there. I know.
[2:57:44] I know.
[2:57:47] When I say I know, it means I know how
[2:57:48] much you pay in tithe.
[2:57:52] So if I look at my brother Marvin or my
[2:57:54] sister and I know she pays
[2:57:58] 5,000 tithe,
[2:58:02] I'm not saying she pays that.
[2:58:05] Therefore, I know she has only 50,000.
[2:58:08] So is the ability there?
[2:58:11] No.
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; But you give according to your faith.
[2:58:18] Many times myself,
[2:58:20] I don't give out of the abundance of
[2:58:22] what I do.
[2:58:25] If I want to get,
[2:58:27] I always, this is what I do. I'm not
[2:58:31] saying you should do the same.
[2:58:33] If there is a need, I always close my
[2:58:35] eyes and I ask the Lord, what would you
[2:58:39] have me to do?
[2:58:41] And then many times he would, you know,
[2:58:44] I I will be impressed to give much more
[2:58:46] than I can afford.
[2:58:49] Either promise and then I begin working
[2:58:51] towards
[2:58:52] and God never fails.
[2:58:55] He provides in ways you never imagined.
[2:59:00] That's what I've seen. That's my
[2:59:02] testimony.
[2:59:04] &gt;&gt; And so, um, there is an exercise
[2:59:09] that I'd like us to do,
[2:59:14] um, to be able to raise this money in
[2:59:16] six months.
[2:59:19] Now, um, whatever you promise because we
[2:59:22] have 12 months.
[2:59:24] And the gentleman said, uh, you know,
[2:59:26] that's the gentleman there.
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; The other brothers were at this side.
[2:59:32] Whoever took the picture did not take
[2:59:33] the other.
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; Where are they? We didn't see them. So
[2:59:39] anyways,
[2:59:41] but um uh that is the gentleman.
[2:59:46] The lady who works with this gentleman
[2:59:50] called us and said this
[2:59:54] was it brother Joel had forgotten
[2:59:56] something there was it you come come
[2:59:59] tell tell us what cuz I don't remember
[3:00:00] very well what he had forgotten what
[3:00:02] come come in what had you forgotten
[3:00:04] there come come you had forgotten your
[3:00:07] earpods there and when you went there
[3:00:09] what did she say
[3:00:10] [Music]
[3:00:13] she said she was so amused the We
[3:00:16] convinced the boss
[3:00:19] and the boss said, "I don't know what
[3:00:21] these people can
[3:00:24] but I just had to let them."
[3:00:28] So, and and there were there was another
[3:00:31] one who was willing to pay cash
[3:00:36] more than what we were paying.
[3:00:38] But he said, "I've already committed
[3:00:39] with these people."
[3:00:42] That place as you saw it, it is in a
[3:00:43] very strategic Anything
[3:00:46] you put there a mall
[3:00:50] shop it can work. So you can see it is a
[3:00:55] high demanded place
[3:00:57] but uh God favored us
[3:01:02] and um so let us um
[3:01:05] uh use faith to now fully possess the
[3:01:08] place.
[3:01:12] So I I was trying to do some mathematics
[3:01:18] and I said to myself,
[3:01:20] if we have 50 of us here
[3:01:25] out of 120 million,
[3:01:29] if 50 of us can say
[3:01:32] me, I'm going to give 1 million
[3:01:36] only 1 million
[3:01:38] that will already be 50 million.
[3:01:43] And I know we have 50 people in this
[3:01:46] church
[3:01:48] who can do that.
[3:01:50] It's not in a day. It is within 6 to 12
[3:01:54] months.
[3:01:57] According to your faith, you can even do
[3:02:00] it in two months.
[3:02:03] It depends on your faith.
[3:02:06] But if you can pledge and say me I'm
[3:02:07] going to give 1 million
[3:02:10] 50 of us
[3:02:13] will collect 50 million
[3:02:16] and then if 10 of us
[3:02:19] can say me
[3:02:21] I'll give 2 million
[3:02:25] that means
[3:02:27] uh that will be 20 million
[3:02:31] you then that is 70
[3:02:34] if five of us
[3:02:37] can say me I will give 3 million
[3:02:42] that will be 15 million
[3:02:46] if another five can say
[3:02:48] me my faith is very large
[3:02:51] I can give five
[3:02:54] that will be 25
[3:02:57] so in other words I need 50 people here
[3:03:01] &gt;&gt; to pledge 1 million
[3:03:04] and I need 10
[3:03:07] &gt;&gt; to pledge to two
[3:03:10] five
[3:03:12] million
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; and one I want him to pledge 10 million
[3:03:21] and the land fund will be finished
[3:03:27] now pastor you said one one 10 minutes
[3:03:32] yet me I I wanted to play 20
[3:03:36] It's okay. You can also pledge to enter
[3:03:38] it. It will reduce on the others who
[3:03:41] can't.
[3:03:44] Now, this pledge that I'm talking about
[3:03:48] is not something that you're going to be
[3:03:50] giving
[3:03:52] at a go in two times.
[3:03:56] Experience has taught us.
[3:03:59] Those pledges never mature.
[3:04:03] So we already have a system in place
[3:04:08] um of our groups
[3:04:12] which has been running for three years
[3:04:13] now
[3:04:18] for is it four?
[3:04:21] How long have we been running this
[3:04:22] system?
[3:04:24] Someone help me correct me. Two years.
[3:04:29] So and we've raised 100 million.
[3:04:35] One and a half years.
[3:04:38] How many weeks? How many weeks were
[3:04:39] they?
[3:04:43] &gt;&gt; 70
[3:04:44] 78 million within 78 million.
[3:04:49] Sorry. within 7 to 8 weeks.
[3:04:52] We did we we raised half almost half
[3:04:56] less than two years
[3:04:59] more than No, we we we collected 100
[3:05:02] million
[3:05:04] not more than half cuz
[3:05:06] the the the the half is 120 110. Yeah.
[3:05:11] Cuz the land is 220.
[3:05:14] You get the point.
[3:05:17] &gt;&gt; So I was saying within that period
[3:05:21] We collected almost half
[3:05:25] of the amount we need.
[3:05:28] So we can do it in six weeks.
[3:05:32] Uh now that we even see the land
[3:05:37] and we are more energized,
[3:05:40] more envisioned.
[3:05:44] Before I continue, how many feel like I
[3:05:46] feel that it is possible?
[3:05:51] God bless you.
[3:05:53] I also believe the way you believe.
[3:05:56] Now we have groups in place.
[3:06:00] There are seven groups
[3:06:02] and I want to believe that every one of
[3:06:04] us is a member.
[3:06:09] So I'm going to task not to waste time
[3:06:11] here.
[3:06:13] I'm going to ask the team leaders
[3:06:17] to speak to their group members
[3:06:23] now after when we are leaving. If you
[3:06:26] know you are part of a group,
[3:06:29] meet your team leader
[3:06:31] and pledge the amount you're going to
[3:06:33] give.
[3:06:35] The treasurers are going to to take this
[3:06:38] list from the group leaders.
[3:06:43] So that here's how it is going to be
[3:06:44] done. For example, myself, I pledged
[3:06:48] already 10 million.
[3:06:51] This one I did already.
[3:06:53] I I I I pledged it when on the day we we
[3:06:56] did because I was very excited.
[3:07:00] But I did not pledge by excitement.
[3:07:04] I was led to do that. I said me I will
[3:07:07] pledge 10 minutes not me and my wife
[3:07:12] me my wife will pledge her own
[3:07:16] from the kameza
[3:07:19] but for me I pledged this. So um now how
[3:07:24] it is going to be how am I going to pay
[3:07:26] it?
[3:07:27] &gt;&gt; Every week.
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; Every week. So already I paid some. This
[3:07:35] is going to be so good in such a way
[3:07:38] that if you pledge for example I pay 10
[3:07:39] million.
[3:07:41] If the Lord gives me two I don't say let
[3:07:44] me pay small
[3:07:46] I put everything there.
[3:07:49] If I get nine I put everything. I don't
[3:07:53] say now I finished. If the Lord gives me
[3:07:57] an unfinished man two months, I pledge
[3:08:01] another one and I begin putting before
[3:08:04] you know it. Who can even finish this in
[3:08:06] three months?
[3:08:10] If every one of you is like me,
[3:08:13] not in the amount,
[3:08:16] but in the faith.
[3:08:18] Faith without works is dead.
[3:08:21] If you put our faith to work.
[3:08:25] So um whatever you pledge it will be
[3:08:28] reducing every week
[3:08:33] according to what you have given in.
[3:08:36] And whatever we shall be announcing here
[3:08:37] every week will be what has been
[3:08:40] collected.
[3:08:42] Remember the treasurers will receive the
[3:08:43] details
[3:08:46] and uh they will be reducing every week
[3:08:49] from you.
[3:08:53] pledged 5 million.
[3:08:56] He has now paid 100,000.
[3:08:59] He is remaining with 4.9.
[3:09:02] You understand? So that will be much
[3:09:04] better.
[3:09:06] It will increase our faith
[3:09:09] and our blessings as well.
[3:09:13] That's what I believe.
[3:09:15] Um already some of us have started
[3:09:17] buying land and for their own families.
[3:09:19] And you see these things when you serve
[3:09:21] the Lord,
[3:09:24] he prospers you.
[3:09:27] Amen.
[3:09:28] &gt;&gt; How many think that this is going to
[3:09:29] work?
[3:09:31] So um if you I'll give you an example.
[3:09:34] If you you you pledge 1 million
[3:09:39] and say I'll pay it in it in six months.
[3:09:45] That means every month you pay 166.
[3:09:51] every week. It means you pay 41,000
[3:09:57] 4241 something like that.
[3:10:00] If you pledge 2 million every week, you
[3:10:03] pay 80.
[3:10:04] [Music]
[3:10:07] Now to the younger ones,
[3:10:10] the younger ones are the schoolgoing
[3:10:12] students.
[3:10:14] They are the only ones who are allowed
[3:10:15] to pledge less than 1 million.
[3:10:27] Yes. Because they don't have income.
[3:10:30] &gt;&gt; They are pledging from what you're
[3:10:31] giving them as well.
[3:10:36] Um and then uh I where is that document?
[3:10:39] Brother Martin, brother Joel, brother
[3:10:41] Dan, where's that document?
[3:10:44] Where's the document which you sent me?
[3:10:47] You have it
[3:10:51] as brother you're planning to you
[3:10:53] preparing to come please
[3:11:01] you can actually come I'm I'm finishing
[3:11:03] I'm getting done
[3:11:10] I'm trying to look okay I have a copy of
[3:11:13] it here but um
[3:11:16] Uh there's a document which we received
[3:11:21] from the owner.
[3:11:23] Listen listen listen from the owner of
[3:11:25] the hotel
[3:11:27] &gt;&gt; and he increased the rent to 1.2
[3:11:29] million.
[3:11:50] This is the document.
[3:11:52] Um, I told you this would happen.
[3:11:56] And that's why I wanted us to sorry,
[3:11:58] that's why I wanted us to to to immunize
[3:12:01] it before it happened.
[3:12:06] We did not.
[3:12:08] So, it has happened.
[3:12:11] So this
[3:12:13] now you are seeing a mountain
[3:12:17] but I'm not seeing a mountain. I'm
[3:12:20] seeing God's provided way.
[3:12:23] God is telling us this plan which I've
[3:12:26] given you.
[3:12:28] We need to take it serious
[3:12:30] and quickly get out of here.
[3:12:33] You remember when God told when Moses
[3:12:36] told Pharaoh, let my people go. It was
[3:12:39] God's provided way.
[3:12:42] But Pharaoh did what? He made things
[3:12:44] tougher.
[3:12:47] It was a sign it was time to go.
[3:12:51] So friends, our time here is over.
[3:12:55] Let's take this serious.
[3:12:57] I told him this is not going to be
[3:13:00] possible.
[3:13:02] Um we will not increase even a
[3:13:04] shielding.
[3:13:07] and he said, "You giving me directives
[3:13:10] on my own property."
[3:13:14] I told him
[3:13:16] um if you insist that you're going to
[3:13:17] increase,
[3:13:20] we will stay in your place for 3 months
[3:13:22] without paying a cobo
[3:13:28] while we look for our own another place.
[3:13:33] It's the law.
[3:13:35] or
[3:13:37] you let us pay what we can pay what we
[3:13:40] have been paying for another period of
[3:13:41] time
[3:13:44] and we live in peace.
[3:13:47] Those talks are still going on.
[3:13:51] But I wanted you to know. So let's take
[3:13:54] this serious
[3:13:57] very serious.
[3:13:59] Not as don't pledge as families.
[3:14:02] Pledge as individuals.
[3:14:05] team leaders get to work after this
[3:14:07] service.
[3:14:11] Brother Dan, brother Joel, please take a
[3:14:12] list from each team leader.
[3:14:17] We would have done it now, but to save
[3:14:18] on time, let's do it that way.
[3:14:21] It is faster that way. And if you're not
[3:14:23] a member of any team,
[3:14:26] uh team leaders, please stand again.
[3:14:31] quickly stand so we can team leaders
[3:14:34] please. Sister Get over here, sister
[3:14:36] Monica. Brother Shalom, sister uh sister
[3:14:40] Adoba, um sister Esther, Sister Fibbe
[3:14:44] back there, sister Favor. So these who
[3:14:47] brother also brother Martin you resigned
[3:14:53] who is the representative
[3:14:57] you you you brother Martin also. So you
[3:15:00] don't want any member any new members.
[3:15:03] Ah okay. Okay. So so these are the are
[3:15:07] the so meet any of those and tell them
[3:15:11] if you're not belonging to any group and
[3:15:13] then I'll pay this much
[3:15:16] months. I will pay 1 million in six
[3:15:19] months. I'll pay 1 million in 12 months
[3:15:23] because 1 million if you pay it in six
[3:15:25] months you are paying 40 a month.
[3:15:29] If you're paying it in a year, you're
[3:15:31] paying 20 every week.
[3:15:34] So, it's okay according to what you your
[3:15:36] faith.
[3:15:38] Uh and so on Sunday, we will announce to
[3:15:41] you how many pledges have been made
[3:15:46] and I pray we pledge it all
[3:15:50] so that we know what we are targeting
[3:15:53] and uh we we we press toward it.
[3:15:57] If the devil wants or he doesn't want
[3:16:02] it is later than he thinks. We are going
[3:16:05] to achieve this.
[3:16:07] We are going to achieve this.
[3:16:12] I said these words when we had zero
[3:16:17] saying it when we are on the second
[3:16:18] phase.
[3:16:20] You better say a bigger amen.
[3:16:24] Brother please come.
[3:16:28] for another 20 minutes or so. Then we'll
[3:16:30] dismiss.
[3:16:47] God bless you.
[3:16:49] To me, I'm very, very excited cuz I've
[3:16:52] got the revelation.
[3:16:55] So I don't know if you are excited with
[3:16:57] me. Uh
[3:17:00] it's all up to you. So
[3:18:03] All right.
[3:18:06] Uh I hope everyone can see. Uh brother,
[3:18:10] can you see this?
[3:18:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. I thought the light was a lot.
[3:18:16] All right. So, uh God bless you all.
[3:18:19] Like I said once again, I'm very excited
[3:18:22] because uh even the word today it's not
[3:18:25] I had prepared to present this but I
[3:18:28] didn't know that the word would be this
[3:18:30] inspiring
[3:18:32] about the same revelation about what we
[3:18:36] put in the work of God.
[3:18:38] So uh I got this idea and then I shared
[3:18:41] with the pastor
[3:18:45] and uh he proposed that I should present
[3:18:48] it to everyone
[3:18:51] for them for those that will catch it
[3:18:54] they will catch it and for those that
[3:18:56] will let it go it will pass. So it's
[3:19:00] voluntarily but mostly it's going to the
[3:19:02] youth.
[3:19:04] uh what when I talk of the youth
[3:19:07] sometimes the married people also the
[3:19:10] older people they take themselves out of
[3:19:13] the way but this is this church is we
[3:19:17] are like 95%
[3:19:19] we are youth
[3:19:22] so I think that speaks it all
[3:19:25] so
[3:19:27] almost everyone here is a youth
[3:19:28] including our pastor
[3:19:31] [Music]
[3:19:35] Okay. So, um
[3:19:38] first uh
[3:19:41] &gt;&gt; this scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter
[3:19:44] 9 verse 6.
[3:19:46] &gt;&gt; But this I say, he which saw sparingly
[3:19:50] shall reap also sparingly. And he which
[3:19:54] seth bountifully shall reap also
[3:19:56] bountifully.
[3:19:58] So no need to talk anything about this.
[3:20:03] But this scripture makes me think and
[3:20:05] realize
[3:20:06] that where we are right now from what
[3:20:09] the talking about
[3:20:14] and this
[3:20:16] it's an opportunity for us because if we
[3:20:21] don't reap sorry if we don't sow we
[3:20:23] don't we won't reap so
[3:20:27] if we don't have where to sow what shall
[3:20:29] we reap so we should be happy that we
[3:20:31] have where we can we are going to sow
[3:20:33] now we have the camp meetings we have
[3:20:35] the church land fund so uh let's say we
[3:20:38] get to a point where the church has a
[3:20:40] lot of money to fund these meetings and
[3:20:42] we have our land we have our church uh
[3:20:44] our brothers and sisters it will be
[3:20:46] absurd for us
[3:20:49] because I don't know then how we shall
[3:20:52] so
[3:20:54] um I'm going to talk about uh three
[3:20:56] things uh one is the 20 last year youth
[3:21:00] camp and then I also talk of uh the
[3:21:05] this youth camp that is coming that will
[3:21:08] be mostly the budget and also I called
[3:21:12] it fundraising. I don't know if that is
[3:21:13] the the right word to use.
[3:21:17] So uh last in the last uh youth camp we
[3:21:21] have had a lot of issues.
[3:21:24] One of course we changed the venue about
[3:21:27] three times. uh like it was a lot. The
[3:21:31] amount we budgeted was a lot. The the
[3:21:33] amount we sp like everyone had a lot of
[3:21:36] questions and like a lot of issues
[3:21:38] around the budget that we had made
[3:21:41] initially it was 38.8
[3:21:45] million.
[3:21:46] It is a lot right?
[3:21:50] So the total amount that was spent
[3:21:52] roughly it was around 58 million
[3:21:55] and uh this is uh how it came that the
[3:22:00] pastor had a lot of um had a lot of
[3:22:05] money that he had to cover on the land
[3:22:07] fund. Uh brethren like this is so absurd
[3:22:12] that our pastor went through all that. I
[3:22:14] don't know uh those who hoped uh to
[3:22:17] support him pay this money.
[3:22:20] I'm not part of them but still it's so
[3:22:24] so absurd. I feel it. I did not act but
[3:22:28] it's really so bad. We should never
[3:22:30] never allow this ever happen again.
[3:22:33] That's why this time I presented this to
[3:22:35] the pastor so that like he gets out of
[3:22:38] this. This is the camp the youth camp
[3:22:41] meetings. let us take care of this. Let
[3:22:45] him worry about the land fund. Uh like I
[3:22:49] also talked about the rent and stuff. So
[3:22:52] the youth camp let us have them in our
[3:22:56] hands. So we pledged as a church it was
[3:23:01] volunted
[3:23:03] 9 million 6660,000.
[3:23:08] Um there are a lot of absurd things to
[3:23:12] say but of these pledges only 5.5 was
[3:23:16] cleared and 4 million was not paid. We
[3:23:21] have the list of those who didn't pay
[3:23:24] some could pay a half but there are even
[3:23:26] people who didn't pay not even a single
[3:23:29] shilling of uh what they pledged. So
[3:23:34] I'm not preaching but um
[3:23:38] we really need to to check our lives
[3:23:41] like if we we pray and don't uh pay that
[3:23:46] means uh brother Polly I remember you
[3:23:50] could be the latest person who listen to
[3:23:52] the past sermons there where the pastor
[3:23:54] preached of um the principle of sewing.
[3:23:59] So it looks like that sermon
[3:24:02] most people it just passed off our ears
[3:24:06] because uh you preach that is one you
[3:24:10] don't fulfill and also some people we
[3:24:12] don't pledge no this should be of the
[3:24:14] past we are now new so let us start
[3:24:18] these youth meetings let them be a
[3:24:20] testimony for us so that was the past
[3:24:25] now we are moving to 2026 youth camp
[3:24:27] meetings
[3:24:29] Okay. So the first uh these are the
[3:24:32] dates
[3:24:34] uh to be Friday 9th. It's uh when we
[3:24:37] shall start then Sunday 11th that will
[3:24:40] be January 2026.
[3:24:42] Arrival being on Friday. Um we have not
[3:24:45] really seen if we shall have the
[3:24:48] services the whole day
[3:24:50] and then um they'll start through the
[3:24:52] weekend uh Sunday
[3:24:55] and uh we depart on Monday morning and
[3:24:58] the venue will be PDN.
[3:25:01] So uh it's also a good thing because the
[3:25:04] other time PDN we went there they had
[3:25:06] already booked but right now we have
[3:25:08] booked although we have not paid the the
[3:25:11] booking fee but once we finish here I'm
[3:25:15] sure uh the energy that I have right now
[3:25:18] we are going to book that place this
[3:25:20] week
[3:25:23] so um we went there and uh we confirmed
[3:25:28] everything weed it was a lot of bag And
[3:25:31] uh they gave us the place and uh the
[3:25:35] best part is PDN is very very cheap of
[3:25:40] the 38 million that we had planned last
[3:25:42] time.
[3:25:43] This is the the budget.
[3:25:46] We are going to do our best to make sure
[3:25:48] that the budget does not go beyond this.
[3:25:53] Uh just roughly the venue uh each day
[3:25:57] will be 1.2. It was also after thorough
[3:25:59] negotiations. So for all the time it
[3:26:02] will be 3.6.
[3:26:04] Um
[3:26:06] the other side at Chamogo we we we paid
[3:26:09] for music instruments and all that like
[3:26:12] it was a hassle but this time we are not
[3:26:15] paying for anything. They have uh the
[3:26:17] system and uh we won't be paying
[3:26:20] anything. So this will be the 200 is for
[3:26:22] the music department because u I
[3:26:25] mentioned that whosoever is having any
[3:26:28] department and is having uh expenses
[3:26:34] okay
[3:26:37] so for those who didn't come to church
[3:26:39] unfortunately we won't be able to have
[3:26:41] this online but uh
[3:26:45] you can hear
[3:26:47] so that's the good thing about the PD
[3:26:50] that's why the it has reduced the budget
[3:26:53] has reduced so much
[3:26:56] uh music uh the music department if
[3:26:59] there's anything uh a brother shame it
[3:27:02] will be on your budget you will meet it
[3:27:05] you will pay for the rest of your
[3:27:06] expenses because I never received
[3:27:08] anything and the budgeting team so 200
[3:27:16] so
[3:27:19] uh the food um it is 10 million food the
[3:27:24] other time we had budgeted for 16
[3:27:26] million but uh brother Andrew I think
[3:27:29] also brother Martin and then sister Rose
[3:27:32] they really did a great job they went
[3:27:33] and shopped and we saved a lot of money
[3:27:37] from the food and they used about 8
[3:27:40] million so this time 8 million
