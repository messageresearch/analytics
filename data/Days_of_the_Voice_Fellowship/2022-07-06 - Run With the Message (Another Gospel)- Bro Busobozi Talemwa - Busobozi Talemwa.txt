come back amen let us go to the scripture tonight the book of colossians chapter 1 verse 6 happy to see every one of you this evening uh we are having my little sister account the sister to my wife wonderful family there and the family are we you and uh we are we're glad to have them for going about charity day it was very painful for for my wife for my for her sister to get married together but now they're meeting again after many years a marvel that he has soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ and to another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ christ jude chapter one so my name is okay verses three and four all in iraq when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that he should honestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation and godly men turning the grace of god of our god into our seriousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ amen i mean so let us pray lord jesus uh we just commit ourselves into your hands and disservice that you will speak to our hearts one more time we're gonna name it are you happy to be in the house of the lord this evening so today tonight i'm speaking on it's going to be more like a part two to run with a message but my title tonight is because if you notice the way apostle paul speaks it to the galatians he says i marvel that he has soon removed from him into the grace of christ with such a christian he called you into the christians with such a christian but you are soon removed from him and we talked about the calling for uh several services here [Applause] and he expounds on that phrase and he says it's not entirely another uh the inspiration really that i have to speak on this subject you know i was with brother brother henry uh a few days ago no organ henry and he told me you know what he spoke on sunday was very appropriate too for you because at the time he had just started to look at uh some some ratings of a certain man who had been a pastor and he was now claiming that he is no longer believing the message now that always comes across as as if it were something new and someone or anybody would want to try and find out i'm going through another and yeah i got the so how come that someone would come up and say i was in the message i no longer believe this is a continuation i don't have new notes and so you hear you often hear people saying that they were in the gospel oh would it have been troubling and if it were the moon judy but they have received a new understanding that they now feel that what they believed is not true tonight i would like us to talk about the gospel [Music] vindicated by god himself and if there is going to be another ghost government indicated the same way now you can discover the first one you know [Applause] so it's the same bible by ibrahim but men perverted by what happened it's the same gospel engineering but men perfect by bringing in their ideas [Applause] around that because here whenever you see him behind your neck another one comes and he brings another revelation understanding of scripture and they view their whole church about it or private interpretation of scripture this message is not on the foundation that brother came and brought his interpretations [Music] brother balaam they fed on his steps they saw everything but they only pulled out what they loved [Music] one by one and this one of the of the woman president in america america really shook them so much yeah and you know one of them came up and he talked about it you know he wanted to give a prophecy but he realized he cannot give it as himself because he knows that already giving it many many many years we can [Music] this time he was saying uh he was saying that he noticed you know he started to tell the people actually and we have very many of such ministers and preachers with big followings even in our country nemo and i can see the light on somebody and when he saw that light and everybody understand that go over somebody you would look at that and then it would fade into a vision and then he would begin to see things about were nuclear amen and friends because that was just the beginning of a ministry everywhere that was actually prophesied off in the scriptures that would the animal he was god very controlled bringing this message restore us back to the foundation of the scriptures so we are not looking for vindication that is foreign why did they believe it to be the truth in the first place that's the first thing the second future committee now that they have received a new truth [Music] the gospel come not through the word only but through the power and the manifestation of the holy spirit amen amen look for that manifestation of the holy ghost shall be given foreign because quotation he asks a conjunction he's talking about mark 16. shall follow them that believes [Music] [Applause] [Music] a man cannot qualify himself as a believer until this has happened to god without that experience what you believe by reasoning no man not anymore out of your experience amen i knew where i was going i knew i was going to be a priest i was convinced after hearing the message for a very long time six good months [Music] [Music] [Music] he said what is that spirit but something even when she did not you know something kept on keeping a hold of one when she naturally connecting with her something moved my heart sin i got voice what does it were myself speaking to me the knee answer you'll get an answer stand down raise up your hand when you get confused i don't know what happened what i remember saying i was talking about i was on my feet with my hands and in the name of our lord [Music] [Music] no church can have the right to of calling themselves a believing church until the science has followed them now that is what jesus said was it doing it it's making the word manifest she no [Music] of god amen hallelujah amen you must receive the gospel you must accept the gospel what is it when you receive the word of god only switch gamble you can't say the gospel come to us not in word only but through power with a man and demonstration no no no collaboration i never knew even vocabulary how to capture the young people's mind that's not the way of god there you see him how does god speak to you god comes to you i don't want to get you out of the way and expect when there is sometimes it may be a rough way sometimes it may be at the moment there will be one thing that is sure what you do is always proceed with vindication and something solid or something like i never come to you like this but i come to you knowing only one thing you brothers that are listening to me you only need that manifestation hallelujah and every one of you is potentially a preacher memory and be millionaires today the preachers that we have have gone on our quest to have millionaires and preachers in uganda [Music] it means your ministry is blessed by god forever in every single opening but if you are a poor man never worry about anymore oh god has not blessed you don't know where is it the way god blesses this message not our is the one that the hello oh [Applause] is amen my my my my amen one day sometimes preachers when you speak these things my god why did you call me a bachelor thank god for the prophet of malachi 4. god sent a prophet to me according to malachi 4. if someone doesn't believe it i have nothing to do for them but i believe because malakai fought five to six has to be fulfilled there had to be a prophet to come why did not power you know for around the first coming of jesus christ then there was another woman who is to come you know the second coming that is for you to qualify to be a prophet of god it means the word of god qualifies to come to you the word of god three uh manifestations of of christ as a son christopher our daughter now jesus yes as a son of of god of man who was a prophet he was the one [Music] he he said he was not yeah but he denied naught meaning john the baptist indeed he was not elijah yeah yeah yeah but he had the spirit of the life revealing himself in flesh god manifested in flesh and god in flesh he came as a prophet because a prophet you did not come to prophesy the secular something which you couldn't do the others prophesied and said that that saith the lord jesus said very very he would do the miracles [Music] and this done i mulited your navy nakola and she said isn't this the very messiah meaning she and others knew oh i never never even when she and jesus what but what dispensation are we in really chicago we are at a time pretty much when now he has progressed from just being a son of man what the to being a son of god as a son of god no man in catholic he is now the holy ghost and that progression started on the day of pentecost jesus son of david yes he is a king let me correct myself connected okay who was promised hey as soon as the one listen kev what do you know about genders he promised yes someone quickly opened whatever matthew 17 mata yesterday what does it say brother are you there up oh and what we know jesus 20 years outside of man son of david with the son of god we know he has already finished his office as a son of man who is the son of man he is a prophet if you read the book of the bible he tells us a prophet so we see him will be [Music] shall be revealed again when and we have seen that ministry everybody's opportunity i've seen a man come on the platform would speak they're helpless i would say i've only preached to you but i can't make anything happen i have to wait for him the son of man like you are waiting for him and when he comes question he will do the watch and and he would say now you'll get up now i gotta catch he is here why not the holy spirit is here while he chooses and he can be touched by the feelings have faith but who killed that point he said he said i have nothing to do with it is here what would i do and if you have enough faith he will call you out i can't quite and that would be a heart and the moment you would come and that would help you listen to the message he and after that moment he said there is no life nagaman that would be hidden if you are there or something like that who was a lunatic or something like anything would have a [Music] [Music] and there are many countless countless countless countless things that happened one would have intervened yes people's names were called your government to guide you from me to meetings your name is so-and-so yeah you are from here everything the problem is your doctor said this can be what but actually your problem is i'm sorry i can't be watching [Music] that's not what we see today he had to knock which is saying and this was after he was preaching about that angel commander that came and manifested himself as the messiah it has nothing to do with me he's a civilian i'm just a man the moon is here he's here why do you want to spoke to you about it [Music] let him now come forth and reveal himself and where and theirs is imperfect i think they are about to be too kiddie day and some of it they actually have the gift of discernment of spirits [Music] it can fail many times was actually revealing the son of man again oh where is when i want to has come and said to us the truth again not like he came to that woman at the wedding what are we waiting for the rapture jesus christ jesus [Applause] he preached on the three sep he preached on the works of grace and now there are three different works of grace justification what we have is more than knowledge is more than just women and men position and responsibilities more than just the teaching on holiness more than just the gifts and operations of the gifts in the church christ himself want to speak once is hallelujah amen that's these people are saying they have the truth i'm trying to cover god might be so few but you know sure even if the bible says that the word righteousness could go to heaven it's narrow what the bible is for foreign out in uganda in other countries and as i would go on the internet but i cannot get the internet messaging believers [Applause] you know spend your time with on value oh put them over your window give your life value go on this website that would tell me more about the
