[1:37] You took a
[1:42] thought and thought of
[1:48] me
[1:51] above. You are crucified.

[3:18] you
[3:22] are. You are crucified.
[3:27] [Music]
[3:29] You laid behind the
[3:33] storm. You
[3:35] live to
[3:39] die. Rejected on the
[3:43] Lord like a

[4:21] You live
[4:22] here to
[4:25] die. Rejected and
[4:30] alone like a
[4:33] rose trump.
[4:40] You too can
[4:45] go and hold on
[4:51] me
[4:54] above as the musicians are making it
[4:56] softly. Let's bow our heads to pray.

[28:44] Heavenly Father, we come before you Lord
[28:46] once again this
[28:48] evening. Lord Father, we want to thank
[28:50] you Lord Father. Loving Father, you left
[28:53] for us a debt loving heavenly master.
[28:55] Lord Father, a debt which you didn't
[28:58] owe. Lord Father, you paid a debt. Lord
[29:01] Father, a debt for people who you didn't
[29:04] know. Heavenly King of Kings, Lord
[29:05] Father. Lord Father, we were nothing.
[29:08] Lord Father, but you made us something.
[29:10] Heavenly King of kings, Lord Father,
[29:12] loving Father, you were wounded, Lord
[29:14] Father, for our iniquities, Lord Father,
[29:18] bitter, Lord Father, for our
[29:19] transgressions, heavenly father, but you
[29:21] were innocent, heavenly father, you had
[29:24] no blemish, Lord Father, loving Father,
[29:26] who are we, Lord Father, to be standing
[29:29] before you, Lord Father, this evening,
[29:30] Lord Father, master, Lord Father, all we
[29:34] can do is to give in our lives, Lord
[29:35] Father, to you, Lord Father. Lord
[29:37] Father, there is nothing that can amount
[29:39] Lord Father to pay that debt. Lord
[29:41] Father, loving Father, no one on this
[29:44] world, Lord Father, can ever do that for
[29:46] a friend, Lord Father. But you, Lord,
[29:49] you came down, Lord Father, to prove
[29:51] your love to us, loving, heavenly
[29:52] master, Lord, loving Father, we are

[30:00] Lord Father, Lord Father, there is none
[30:03] like you, Lord Father. Lord, we've
[30:05] searched all over, Lord Father. But Lord
[30:08] Father, there is no one, Lord Father,
[30:10] with such a love, Lord Father, loving
[30:12] Master, we come before you, Lord,
[30:14] Father, for we know that you are with
[30:16] us, Lord, this evening, Lord, Father,
[30:18] for you promise, Lord Father, that you
[30:21] bring us a comforter, Lord Father, you
[30:23] will not leave us, Lord Father, as Lord.
[30:26] Lord, Father, we here, Lord, asking for
[30:28] your grace, Lord Father. May Lord
[30:31] Father, forgive us, Lord, of our
[30:32] shortcomings. Heavenly Master, Lord
[30:34] Father. Lord Father, because we are
[30:36] humans, Lord Father, we easily forget,
[30:38] Lord Father, we easily go short of your
[30:41] word. Lord Father, in our thoughts, Lord
[30:43] Father, in our actions, Lord Father, in
[30:46] our words, heavenly master, Lord Father,
[30:48] my loving father, this is our plea this
[30:51] evening, Lord Father. Lord Father, may
[30:53] you have mercy upon our wicked souls,
[30:55] Lord Father, may you melt these hearts
[30:58] of stone. Lord Father, may you, Lord
[31:00] Father, give us a heart of flesh, Lord
[31:01] Father, that can receive your word, Lord
[31:04] Father, loving Father, we pray, Lord
[31:07] Father, that you may start up a fire
[31:09] once again within us, Lord Father,
[31:11] loving Father, create a clean heart,
[31:13] Lord Father, and restore other in
[31:15] spirit, Lord Father, within our lives,
[31:17] heavenly father, Lord. Loving Father,
[31:20] many of us have gone short of your word,
[31:21] Lord Father. Lord Father, some of us are
[31:24] shaming. Lord Father, most of the people
[31:27] Lord Father gone denying your power.
[31:29] Lord Father, my king of kings, Lord
[31:31] Father, we are humbly apologizing, Lord
[31:34] Father. We are asking for your mercy.
[31:36] Lord Father, begging for your grace.
[31:38] Lord Father, Lord Father, we may come
[31:40] and take full eminence in our lives.
[31:42] Lord Father, may we, Lord, stand with
[31:44] your word, Lord Father. May we not take
[31:46] sides with any other thing, Lord Father.
[31:48] Help us not to compromise with your
[31:50] word, Lord Father. Lord Father may you
[31:52] teach us Lord Father to be doers of your
[31:53] word Lord Father this evening heaven
[31:55] king of kings Lord Father loving master
[31:58] perhaps that's why many of us are sick
[32:00] this evening Lord Father perhaps that's
[32:02] why Lord Father many have fallen

[48:42] us. And Lord, may you make us
[48:46] worthy to be in your
[48:49] presence. And Lord Kim, father, may you
[48:52] come and divide this thought in our
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] midst that you've given me to share with
[48:59] your
[49:01] children. Lord, get me out of the way
[49:04] completely.
[49:07] It's all to do with your with your bride
[49:09] and you
[49:12] Lord Lord Father I pray for each one of
[49:15] us to be
[49:19] blessed and also we remember our
[49:23] pastor may bless him wherever he is
[49:27] Lord in the precious name of Lord
[49:30] Jesus. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints.
[49:41] I think as we are still standing let's
[49:43] open the
[49:49] Bible the book of revelation chapter
[50:01] 4 verse one he say that after this I
[50:04] looked And behold, a door was opened in
[50:07] heaven. And the first voice which I
[50:11] heard was as it were of a
[50:15] trumpet talking with me, which said,
[50:18] "Come up
[50:20] hither, and I will shoot thee things
[50:24] which must be hereafter."
[50:28] Revelation 4, sorry, verse one.
[50:31] Revelations 4 verse one.
[50:48] [Music]
[50:58] Verse one. Yes. Verse one. Verse one.
[51:02] May be seated. to the
[51:05] [Music]
[51:18] court. Praise the Lord,
[51:20] saints. I'm happy again to
[51:23] be here once
[51:27] again. It is always the grace of God to
[51:30] serve him.
[51:33] And I thank pastor for giving me this
[51:36] opportunity.
[51:39] It is rare. It's not easy for pastor to
[51:41] trust you in his absence.
[51:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And of course we
[51:51] are going to have him this coming
[51:55] Sunday. Hope you're all waiting to hear
[51:58] what he has.
[52:02] Hallelujah. Amen. So last
[52:06] time I realized I spoke a lot of things
[52:11] and I didn't bring them to a
[52:15] conclusion.
[52:17] Hallelujah. But today I will try my
[52:19] level best to keep
[52:22] time and still I'm sure I will not
[52:25] finish.
[52:28] So still I'm speaking on part two of
[52:30] come up hither
[52:35] and for a tit I will take the judgment
[52:41] seal if you remember very well we talked
[52:44] about that seal that's the sixth
[52:51] seal
[52:53] hallelujah so here the Bible says
[52:57] You know, last time we say that just
[52:59] maybe for a recap,
[53:01] [Music]
[53:03] the prophet usually could type this
[53:06] chapter and then he says that in
[53:08] Revelation chapter 4, it is the going of
[53:11] the
[53:16] church that the church goes up.
[53:21] But you see, we need to understand these
[53:23] things.
[53:27] We need really to understand and if you
[53:29] pray for me I believe God maybe reveal
[53:32] something small for
[53:37] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So there
[53:40] are these you know the prophet
[53:43] preached revelation the book of
[53:48] symbols. Hallelujah. So there are some
[53:51] things here that where we need sorry let
[53:54] us
[53:59] remove where we need a higher
[54:03] revelation to understand
[54:05] them. And of course we know very well
[54:08] that before
[54:11] 1963 the prophet also could preach
[54:14] things that are not uh to that
[54:18] revelation.
[54:23] with the Pentecostal
[54:26] background some of the things you could
[54:28] come late and correct
[54:31] himself. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Uh
[54:35] there is a picture brother Marvin I
[54:37] forgot to send it to you if you can
[54:38] download
[54:41] it. It shows people going to the
[54:45] rapture.
[54:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see that is
[54:53] Pentecost Pentecostal
[54:56] [Music]
[54:59] perspection. But now we see that after
[55:01] the opening of the
[55:03] seals, there was a higher
[55:08] revelation. So we see there are some
[55:10] things that I want us to get out the the
[55:12] way in this verse.
[55:18] Uh there when when you say that the
[55:21] church goes
[55:25] up, come up hither,
[55:29] what does it mean? Does it really mean
[55:31] fly in the
[55:34] clouds? No
[55:37] sir. What does it
[55:40] mean? Okay, we shall come to that. Now
[55:43] remember that John saw he had a voice
[55:46] like of a
[55:49] trumpet and then the prophet says that
[55:52] he didn't hear the
[55:54] trumpet but he had the voice like of a
[56:00] trumpet bro if you could help on
[56:04] sound. So we can read in in the
[56:08] exposition of the church
[56:12] age the patimos vision say
[56:17] that John did not say it was a
[56:23] trumpet. It was like a
[56:28] trumpet. Now when a trumpet is blown
[56:30] it's a it has an agency about it.
[56:38] Israel was always assembled by the
[56:41] sounding of a
[56:45] trumpet. Something important is at hand.
[56:51] Then he say that, "Oh, that we might
[56:55] hear the voice of God as a trumpet this
[57:02] day. For it is the gospel
[57:06] trumpet, sounding
[57:09] forth the word of the of
[57:12] prophecy to make us aware of and
[57:15] prepared for what is coming.
[57:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This voice that
[57:25] is like a
[57:28] trumpet. Of course, why he said it's not
[57:31] a trumpet but voice like a
[57:36] trumpet. We know that trumpets are for
[57:39] the
[57:41] Jews. And then the seals are for the
[57:45] bride. And then the seven vials they are
[57:48] for the world,
[57:54] the unbelievers.
[57:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:00] So whenever the preacher stands here to
[58:05] preach, it's an
[58:09] urgency. It's an urgency.
[58:12] [Music]
[58:17] needs you to to act
[58:21] immediately. When you go to the message
[58:23] of s is it the end
[58:27] time the prophet preaches and
[58:32] repeatedly he keeps saying that
[58:33] something is fixing
[58:37] to when he's preaching the
[58:40] seals he's always saying
[58:44] Now you understand it. Now I think you
[58:46] get it. I hope you have not missed
[58:49] it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it is an
[58:53] [Music]
[58:57] urgency. It is a voice like a
[59:00] trumpet. And that is for every preacher
[59:03] that
[59:03] [Music]
[59:06] stands. the five-fold ministry
[59:11] to the bride. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[59:15] So, and and we see that this is
[59:20] Naomi when we go in the in the book of
[59:23] Ruth, we see this
[59:27] trumpet who was typing the old
[59:30] [Music]
[59:32] church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[59:35] and the fivefold ministry if
[59:40] I'm
[59:42] uh she was sounding to
[59:48] Ruth giving her the words of
[59:52] wisdom and it was an
[59:56] urgency come up he hither
[1:00:00] Ruth rest at Bo's
[1:00:02] feet hallelujah
[1:00:04] And now remember that Ruth when he had
[1:00:06] this sounding
[1:00:09] trumpet gospel trumpet of the five-fold
[1:00:14] ministry she had to act to act
[1:00:18] immediately. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:21] Receive her kinsman
[1:00:24] redeemer. So saints preachers come stand
[1:00:27] here on the
[1:00:29] pit. Please act immediately.
[1:00:34] Whatever they they are talking
[1:00:36] about take note of
[1:00:39] [Music]
[1:00:40] it because by all means you have to act
[1:00:45] or you don't act.
[1:00:56] And now why have I brought this Ruth and
[1:01:01] Naomi? Remember at that point O was not
[1:01:07] there. Where was
[1:01:09] she? And yet they were together.
[1:01:13] They were together. Remember O and Ruth?
[1:01:17] of the same
[1:01:19] tribe of the same tribe married to both
[1:01:23] the sons of
[1:01:27] God. But where where was she at this
[1:01:33] moment? She was
[1:01:37] behind incia.
[1:01:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why? Because
[1:01:41] there had to be a time of decision.
[1:01:47] And now I think you're getting the
[1:01:48] reason why I read for you last time.
[1:01:50] Revelation chapter 17 verse 14.
[1:01:58] Do you think we should repeat
[1:02:01] it? Let's repeat it to get it
[1:02:09] better. Something is going on. Saints
[1:02:13] the man. So
[1:02:17] here it says
[1:02:19] that 17 15 oh 14. Yeah. Uh this shall
[1:02:24] make war with the lamb and the lamb
[1:02:28] shall overcome them for he is lord of
[1:02:32] lords and king of kings. And they that
[1:02:35] are with him are called and chosen and
[1:02:39] faithful.
[1:03:02] and called. It is by
[1:03:09] predestination. They are chosen by
[1:03:13] election and faithful by their decision.
[1:03:20] you know, they have to make a
[1:03:23] choice. Ruth decided to go to stay with
[1:03:28] Naomi and was giving her the words of
[1:03:33] wisdom. And that was the gospel
[1:03:37] trumpet that was leading her to the feet
[1:03:39] of
[1:03:41] Boaz. And of course, you know, it ended
[1:03:43] up when she was
[1:03:47] redeemed. The full redemption.
[1:03:51] Hallelujah. I I think now you can
[1:03:53] connect the reason I read
[1:03:56] that uh brother Joel preached on
[1:04:01] Friday if I'm to remember
[1:04:05] Friday about Jacob's uh is it walk
[1:04:10] Jacob's walk?
[1:04:12] And then he say that there are three
[1:04:15] people
[1:04:18] involved. Jacob had to play a
[1:04:24] part. The mother had to play a part
[1:04:29] also. And who else was play a
[1:04:32] part? God
[1:04:35] himself. Now what God did, God elected.
[1:04:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:44] And what did he do? What was his part?
[1:04:48] It was to be
[1:04:49] faithful to the
[1:04:52] election that make a
[1:04:55] decision and then through his
[1:04:59] mother, God predestinated
[1:05:02] it that the mother will give her wisdom.
[1:05:05] It will be that way.
[1:05:10] So it is with the church of
[1:05:13] Christ there is a part for the bright
[1:05:17] play and that's the the part of making a
[1:05:23] decision already God
[1:05:26] already elected you
[1:05:29] already. He chose you by
[1:05:33] election and then he
[1:05:35] predestinated he predestinated your
[1:05:42] work of course through the five-fold
[1:05:49] ministry. God was merciful to
[1:05:52] us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So whenever
[1:05:56] the preacher stands
[1:06:00] here always take everything.
[1:06:04] Okay. I know sometimes the preacher can
[1:06:06] speak piercing words
[1:06:11] directly. But friends, it is because of
[1:06:15] something that is coming.
[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:19] Just don't uh you know don't shake your
[1:06:23] fist against the preacher
[1:06:27] like how Kane did.
[1:06:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So remember the
[1:06:32] prophet
[1:06:34] says why am I connecting this to the
[1:06:36] judgment
[1:06:40] seal? Remember I told you that the bride
[1:06:42] is beaten out of
[1:06:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now remember
[1:06:51] the prophet says
[1:06:53] that whenever we come to
[1:06:56] church every Sunday is a judgment
[1:06:58] judgment seat of
[1:07:03] God. Every
[1:07:06] Sunday it's judgment. That's what the
[1:07:09] prophet say.
[1:07:10] So if a preacher preaches a very good
[1:07:14] sermon, a lovely sermon, nice to
[1:07:19] hear, that Sunday you are
[1:07:22] lucky because it is a judgment seat
[1:07:25] every
[1:07:28] Sunday because I've heard some people
[1:07:31] maybe a preacher comes here and
[1:07:35] preach of course you know when the
[1:07:36] preachers are preaching they are also
[1:07:39] careful not call out your
[1:07:43] name. But even if it happens, friends,
[1:07:46] just break. Take
[1:07:50] it. Just take it. Take it. Because now
[1:07:53] we are going to see
[1:07:55] here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we
[1:07:58] go back to our scripture. Come up
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:04] hither. Come
[1:08:06] up. What was it meaning?
[1:08:12] You see Jesus said in I think in Luke
[1:08:18] 21 when you see these things they have
[1:08:20] come to
[1:08:23] pass. Lift up your
[1:08:27] hands and look
[1:08:29] up for your redemption draws
[1:08:34] near. Wait a minute. What was he
[1:08:36] meaning?
[1:08:39] Was he meaning that you look up in the
[1:08:41] skies?
[1:08:44] Not really. Now you're going to see the
[1:08:47] reason why when the prophet was
[1:08:48] preaching about the
[1:08:52] rapture. He went to
[1:08:54] Psalms 27. Not second
[1:08:58] Corinthians,
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:01] not not 2 Corinthians
[1:09:05] 15, neither 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:09:09] 4. Hallelujah. Of course, we know all
[1:09:12] this was after the opening of the seals.
[1:09:18] I'm saying that this was after the
[1:09:20] opening of the seals when this
[1:09:21] revelation was
[1:09:26] delivered. Not the Pentecostal
[1:09:30] view. Hallelujah. Come up. What does he
[1:09:36] mean? And also we see
[1:09:39] Stefan when he was beaten and
[1:09:41] stoned. The Bible says, I think in the
[1:09:44] book of Acts chapter
[1:09:46] 7, he looked up
[1:09:52] steadily steadfastly into
[1:09:55] heavens and saw the glory of
[1:10:00] God. Did he look like this and saw uh
[1:10:04] the heaven
[1:10:07] open? Not
[1:10:09] really. So what does he mean?
[1:10:12] The prophet say that it means higher
[1:10:18] dimension and now higher
[1:10:21] dimension he does not mean like a story
[1:10:27] building you know there's how
[1:10:28] Pentecostals draw the dimension the
[1:10:30] first dimension
[1:10:32] down the second dimension the
[1:10:36] fifth no it's not that it is higher in
[1:10:40] terms of
[1:10:45] access but everything is here. All the
[1:10:48] dimensions are here connected to you
[1:10:49] right
[1:10:52] now. I will give you an
[1:10:55] example the dimension of
[1:10:58] hell. It is right here.
[1:11:02] You remember in the third
[1:11:05] seal when that pale horse rider was
[1:11:10] riding, the Bible
[1:11:12] says that hell followed
[1:11:16] him. Hell followed
[1:11:19] him.
[1:11:22] So, okay, that's not what I'm talking
[1:11:24] about. But if if God allows another
[1:11:27] time, we shall talk about it.
[1:11:30] But
[1:11:31] anyway, the dimensions they are with us.
[1:11:36] It is all about the
[1:11:42] access
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:45] between. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now we
[1:11:49] see even Jesus
[1:11:52] himself. I will give you an
[1:11:54] example for the scripture but it says no
[1:11:58] one has ascended to heaven
[1:12:02] except the son
[1:12:06] who came down from
[1:12:09] heaven and then he said who is in
[1:12:15] heaven the son of
[1:12:18] man. Hallelujah. What was he meaning? He
[1:12:22] was meaning that
[1:12:24] dimension he was accessing
[1:12:29] it.
[1:12:30] Hallelujah. So what does the what what
[1:12:33] does the Bible mean that you should come
[1:12:35] up
[1:12:38] here? It's all to do with the
[1:12:41] dimensions. It is to do with the
[1:12:46] dimensions bro. Did you get the
[1:12:49] picture? Of course, you know these
[1:12:52] photos have I think you have ever seen
[1:12:56] them. People are
[1:13:00] going naked women with
[1:13:04] trousers and mini
[1:13:08] skirts. Oh, what a
[1:13:11] deception. What a deception.
[1:13:14] The prophet say that it will be in a
[1:13:16] twink of an
[1:13:18] eye just switching between the
[1:13:22] dimensions and then he say that this
[1:13:25] world you see it is in three
[1:13:30] 3D
[1:13:31] dimensions for you to
[1:13:34] live you see and that's light
[1:13:37] matter and
[1:13:40] time without any of
[1:13:43] Because you cannot
[1:13:45] exist everything will
[1:13:48] freeze. So you see that even human
[1:13:50] beings they also in
[1:13:54] three soul spirit
[1:13:58] and without the
[1:14:00] body you're not a living
[1:14:03] soul. Without a soul you are dead body.
[1:14:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:09] So and also maybe I I will Since I'm not
[1:14:12] talking about that
[1:14:15] today, you can I didn't even put it in
[1:14:18] my notes here, but I don't know why I
[1:14:19] was going that direction,
[1:14:22] but you can read the messages uh present
[1:14:25] stage of my
[1:14:30] ministry
[1:14:32] countdown influence on 1963
[1:14:38] August and others as well.
[1:14:41] The prophet talks about those
[1:14:43] dimensions. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:14:46] now we see that
[1:14:48] Jesus was living in
[1:14:51] flesh but at the same time he's in
[1:14:53] another
[1:14:56] dimension. And the prophet in the
[1:14:58] message it's the raising of the
[1:15:01] sun. He
[1:15:04] says that he was the wave sheep
[1:15:06] offering.
[1:15:10] It was there the first
[1:15:15] fruit the
[1:15:18] offering typing of uh you know the
[1:15:22] meaning of the first
[1:15:25] fruit in the old
[1:15:28] testament it
[1:15:30] means it is taping of the remaining uh
[1:15:35] the remaining seeds.
[1:15:40] that they are also coming to that level
[1:15:42] of
[1:15:45] maturity. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:15:47] the prophet says that he was he was
[1:15:50] waved.
[1:15:52] Hallelujah. On the
[1:15:55] cross. But again he was waved
[1:16:00] again uh in re in 1963.
[1:16:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that brings
[1:16:08] us to the bread edge. Hallelujah.
[1:16:13] It brings us to the harvest
[1:16:17] time. And now it means that we also we
[1:16:20] ought to come to that level of
[1:16:24] maturity to the full adoption of the
[1:16:27] sons of
[1:16:31] God. Friends, let's stop these things of
[1:16:33] joking of Lakia.
[1:16:38] While the preacher comes here and
[1:16:40] preaches and you leave when you are sad
[1:16:42] in your
[1:16:44] heart just let it
[1:16:47] go. Hallelujah. And now here we
[1:16:51] see that coming up
[1:16:55] hither friends it is to do with the
[1:17:00] dimensions and it's very
[1:17:03] possible because Jesus Christ son of man
[1:17:07] being re he was uh being revealed
[1:17:10] through
[1:17:15] brotherham and he was giving us an
[1:17:17] example of the level of maturity should
[1:17:19] come
[1:17:23] to now. It didn't only stop with brother
[1:17:27] Brandon. But it was
[1:17:30] waved. The pillow of fire was waved over
[1:17:32] the
[1:17:33] people.
[1:17:35] Hallelujah. Why? Because the rising of
[1:17:37] the
[1:17:39] sun. Why? It is the rising of the
[1:17:44] sun. You know, it's the raising of the
[1:17:47] sun. The prophet say
[1:17:48] that uh in the message I believe Christ
[1:17:52] the mystery of God revealed.
[1:17:57] He
[1:17:59] says that the son rose from the
[1:18:03] dead the
[1:18:07] s from the
[1:18:09] dead and it was lighting. There was
[1:18:13] light in the
[1:18:15] beginning in the beginning of the
[1:18:19] church. But then
[1:18:22] afterwards we see that men's idea pad
[1:18:28] up piled up and piled
[1:18:31] up and left the sand
[1:18:35] behind. And now because of of the
[1:18:37] accumulations of those piles
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:43] It produced the church
[1:18:46] ages because the church ages, you see,
[1:18:49] when Paul was
[1:18:52] writing, when James was
[1:18:55] writing, if you read their
[1:18:59] writings, do does it seem like they are
[1:19:02] writing church
[1:19:05] ages? They were writing like as if time
[1:19:07] is now.
[1:19:11] Time is
[1:19:13] normal. So churches were not in their
[1:19:19] minds because the sun had already
[1:19:22] risen. It was
[1:19:25] light. But now Jehovah already
[1:19:30] predestinated and he saw it would be
[1:19:33] that
[1:19:34] way. And through through Ezekiel
[1:19:41] He prophesied and said, "There shall be
[1:19:43] light in the
[1:19:46] evening. The son that was left
[1:19:50] behind again, he will be revealed and
[1:19:52] appear in the end
[1:19:56] time and we are living in that very
[1:20:03] time. It's the time of the resurrection.
[1:20:08] It's the Easter time.
[1:20:12] Hallelujah. My my my. So we see that it
[1:20:17] is the it's to do with dimensions.
[1:20:22] You remember brother Bos
[1:20:25] when he
[1:20:27] died and the prophet
[1:20:31] says that this
[1:20:34] brother he
[1:20:36] died and he was in the
[1:20:40] room. First of all he called his
[1:20:44] family and he said bye to them
[1:20:47] by and he was busy greeting the unseen.
[1:20:55] the beloved that
[1:20:57] died. But yet this brother was still in
[1:21:00] his
[1:21:02] body. But he was
[1:21:04] switching.
[1:21:06] Hallelujah. With inside of it was
[1:21:09] calling it was switching into that
[1:21:13] dimension, the sixth
[1:21:16] dimension. Hallelujah. And then he went
[1:21:18] and then there's also another brother
[1:21:21] who
[1:21:22] died. And then this one, the prophet saw
[1:21:25] a
[1:21:27] vision. He saw him when his body is
[1:21:30] there. But this brother was busy
[1:21:34] greeting people
[1:21:36] there. He was
[1:21:40] crossing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You
[1:21:43] see brother Martin on Sunday
[1:21:47] preached and he said there is something
[1:21:49] that he talked
[1:21:50] about was it Sunday or he was giving
[1:21:54] remarks on
[1:21:56] Friday and he said a
[1:21:59] brother you are just there
[1:22:02] local you can't even
[1:22:05] think what if I'm moving on the way and
[1:22:08] then I'm knocked I
[1:22:12] You are just waiting for that very
[1:22:16] moment. Remember time is filled with
[1:22:18] swift
[1:22:23] transition. In a twink of an eye, you
[1:22:25] find yourself when you are switched into
[1:22:26] the other
[1:22:29] dimension. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:22:32] now
[1:22:33] friends, there's a scripture that Jesus
[1:22:35] talked
[1:22:38] about. The prophet was not understanding
[1:22:40] this
[1:22:42] scripture. I'm not correcting
[1:22:45] him. He corrected
[1:22:49] himself. Through his
[1:22:52] correction, we also got the
[1:22:55] revelation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:58] Um I didn't write it here.
[1:23:02] But it
[1:23:04] says that if your hand offends the
[1:23:12] offended, cut it
[1:23:14] off something like that. You
[1:23:17] remember for it is
[1:23:19] better to enter in life when you are
[1:23:23] named
[1:23:27] than going to
[1:23:29] hell with two two
[1:23:34] hands. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then
[1:23:36] he said that
[1:23:40] I think let me find it here. Let me find
[1:23:42] just a moment. Just a moment. Just a
[1:23:44] moment.
[1:23:45] A moment a
[1:23:47] moment says
[1:23:50] that where they warm warm dieth
[1:23:56] [Music]
[1:23:58] not and the fire is not
[1:24:02] quenched.
[1:24:04] Hallelujah. Does it mean that in hell
[1:24:06] there are
[1:24:08] wombs? Does it mean that there is a
[1:24:11] burning
[1:24:13] fire? Of course, when you read it that
[1:24:16] you can get some
[1:24:19] imaginations, but that's not what it was
[1:24:23] mean. The worm dieth not. The worm dieth
[1:24:28] not. It refers to the to your
[1:24:34] conscience or
[1:24:37] guilty that torments you in hell.
[1:24:44] eating you up
[1:24:48] eternally. The time tested
[1:24:52] memorials. You see, whenever preacher
[1:24:55] stands here and preaches, any word of
[1:24:57] God that you
[1:25:00] hear and you don't
[1:25:03] act, it is those very words that are
[1:25:06] going to torment
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:09] you. What's the worst? That's your
[1:25:13] soul. That's your
[1:25:15] soul. It will be not even God tormenting
[1:25:21] you. It will be you yourself. You're
[1:25:24] conscious. You're
[1:25:27] guilty. Tormenting you
[1:25:33] seriously. And now this fire that never
[1:25:36] quenched, it's not the fire like how you
[1:25:39] think.
[1:25:41] But let me leave that.
[1:25:45] Hallelujah for another time.
[1:25:49] Now we see that the prophet say that the
[1:25:52] only
[1:25:53] solution to our condition
[1:25:57] in it is revelation chapter
[1:26:02] 4 to be caught
[1:26:05] up into a certain
[1:26:08] dimension. Hallelujah. Amen. Into a
[1:26:12] certain
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:14] dimension. And by by God's
[1:26:20] predestination, he gave us the
[1:26:23] preachers. He gave us he said for us the
[1:26:27] prophet. The pastor is always preaching
[1:26:31] here. What have you
[1:26:34] done? What have you done, saints?
[1:26:38] What have we done?
[1:26:41] You see, so we have always to ask
[1:26:43] ourselves and always we we try our our
[1:26:47] level
[1:26:49] best to do
[1:26:54] something. And now we see here there are
[1:26:56] two
[1:26:57] reasons you may not come
[1:27:01] up into that dimension.
[1:27:05] Reason
[1:27:06] one, either you haven't heard the the
[1:27:08] gospel
[1:27:12] trumpet. Of course, you're not
[1:27:16] here. Those are
[1:27:18] unbelievers. Reason
[1:27:20] two, you are still behind the walls
[1:27:25] of the walls of Jericho.
[1:27:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see, when
[1:27:32] you go in the book of Joshua,
[1:27:37] The
[1:27:38] priests, they had to blow the
[1:27:42] trumpets. They had to draw to blow the
[1:27:48] trumpet. No, no, no. They had to blow
[1:27:52] the trumpets that day. I'm talking about
[1:27:54] a specific
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:59] time. Not
[1:28:01] really. Okay, you'll get it. Let me
[1:28:03] first say these priests they had to blow
[1:28:07] the trumpets and then the people also
[1:28:11] were they had to respond that those
[1:28:14] trumpets for for the walls to
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:23] fall. Exactly. God bless you. Amen. So
[1:28:26] we see that it was the duty of the
[1:28:29] priest to blow the
[1:28:32] trumpets and the trumpets were calling
[1:28:34] for
[1:28:38] urgency. And then these people they also
[1:28:40] had a part to
[1:28:43] play because remember the trumpets were
[1:28:45] not bring down the
[1:28:48] walls. It is the bride.
[1:28:52] The bride has a
[1:28:54] ministry in this time. Hallelujah.
[1:28:57] Hallelujah. She has to bring down those
[1:29:01] walls. Hallelujah.
[1:29:04] And
[1:29:05] now uh these priests they they blew the
[1:29:12] trumpets and whenever in Israel whenever
[1:29:15] the trumpets are
[1:29:17] blown you have to act
[1:29:20] immediately.
[1:29:22] immediately. Even if you are
[1:29:25] lame, no
[1:29:27] excuse if you don't act
[1:29:31] what there are consequences
[1:29:33] also. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we see
[1:29:36] now to this age that we are living
[1:29:39] in the consequences of not responding
[1:29:42] urgently.
[1:29:48] You find yourself that you are in a
[1:29:51] point of no
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:55] return, no
[1:29:57] mercy for
[1:30:00] you because the prophet
[1:30:02] says that keeps spanning the mercy of
[1:30:05] God,
[1:30:14] but you will do that for the last time.
[1:30:21] and you realize that even though you
[1:30:25] repent, you cannot come
[1:30:29] back. I'm talking about the judgment
[1:30:32] seal. So you bear me, you bear with me.
[1:30:37] Hallelujah. So we need we ought to act
[1:30:41] urgently. And and if you don't
[1:30:44] act, you find out that you will be in
[1:30:47] bondage in bondages
[1:30:52] forever. Behind the
[1:30:55] walls. Let's let's first look a little
[1:30:57] bit about these
[1:31:01] walls. Uh we have very many walls in
[1:31:05] LA. We have the lukewarm wall.
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:12] not hot enough to leave the
[1:31:17] message and not cold enough to reject it
[1:31:22] to you are just there.
[1:31:28] The pastor calls you, "Brother, how are
[1:31:32] you?" We are there.
[1:31:35] There you didn't come to
[1:31:39] church.
[1:31:44] Ah, let me tell you,
[1:31:47] brothers, this is so
[1:31:50] real. Uh, okay. I'm I'm sorry. There's a
[1:31:53] brother I talked to before I came here
[1:31:55] on the pull pit.
[1:31:58] Maybe he will hear this. You forgive me.
[1:31:59] I didn't mean to
[1:32:03] bring I didn't mean
[1:32:06] really. Uh but you
[1:32:09] see I you know when I was praying before
[1:32:12] I
[1:32:14] came I
[1:32:16] cried and I said God may help
[1:32:19] us. Because in most cases you find
[1:32:22] ourselves we are entangled.
[1:32:26] in the cares of this
[1:32:30] world. And then it is the cares of this
[1:32:32] world that makes us put God number
[1:32:39] two. And we find ourselves God is not in
[1:32:43] the first
[1:32:47] place in our hearts.
[1:32:50] You see how can you miss
[1:32:53] church because you're
[1:33:00] worrying because you're looking for this
[1:33:02] and
[1:33:03] this. You don't have rent.
[1:33:10] Everyone has those
[1:33:13] problems, but we just switch them
[1:33:17] off and then we activate the other
[1:33:21] dimension.
[1:33:23] Hallelujah. And that is what we ought to
[1:33:27] do. That's what we ought to
[1:33:31] do. And you see this
[1:33:34] lukewarm wall.
[1:33:39] May God help us because that now
[1:33:42] concerns all of
[1:33:44] us. May God help us
[1:33:47] brethren be able to
[1:33:49] overcome because it is not easy to
[1:33:53] tell because remember these are not
[1:33:56] being lukewarm. You are not busy with
[1:34:02] sin but you're a good
[1:34:05] person only that you are busy with the
[1:34:07] cares of
[1:34:11] the last time now I read for you
[1:34:13] scripture which
[1:34:15] says to be minded
[1:34:20] is it is death but now remember to be
[1:34:25] minded is not to be sinful
[1:34:32] Just these natural things take you
[1:34:36] out and you find yourself you are
[1:34:38] replacing God from uh that position. You
[1:34:41] put him in
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:45] another. And what is the
[1:34:48] solution? It is repent. As simple as
[1:34:50] that.
[1:34:53] Let me tell you
[1:34:54] friends, you are still missing
[1:34:58] church because of the cares of the
[1:35:01] world. The time is going to
[1:35:05] come when this sixth
[1:35:09] seal. It is in its full engage fully
[1:35:15] engaged and you are always at church
[1:35:18] from Monday to
[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:23] Monday. Maybe even call pastor. Hey
[1:35:26] pastor, do we have a service on
[1:35:30] Tuesday? Can we have overnight on
[1:35:34] Monday? Friends, that time is soon
[1:35:37] coming.
[1:35:41] And time is filled with swift
[1:35:47] transition. Within a twink of an
[1:35:50] eye, you'll find yourself caught into
[1:35:53] that
[1:35:56] time.
[1:35:58] And and in that time, you're not even
[1:36:01] seeing how busy you are.
[1:36:09] We have the walls
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:17] of no still the same
[1:36:21] walls. The wall I will not finish them
[1:36:24] all but I'll talk about the zeal for
[1:36:30] God. The lost zeal.
[1:36:35] You see
[1:36:37] today I was I appreciate those brothers
[1:36:39] who came early and started
[1:36:42] praying. They created an atmosphere
[1:36:46] here. I felt it when I was entering the
[1:36:48] church. I felt
[1:36:52] ashamed because I came
[1:36:55] just to realize there's a certain
[1:36:59] atmosphere. You see because the brothers
[1:37:01] they already
[1:37:03] praying. I wish we can keep it that
[1:37:06] way. I wish we can be doing
[1:37:10] that. You find you come from
[1:37:13] home 2 minutes to the
[1:37:18] service. Why zeal
[1:37:24] lost? If God gives us grace
[1:37:28] again and go God gives me another
[1:37:31] chance, I will talk about that.
[1:37:34] in a
[1:37:35] depth. The harvest
[1:37:39] time show you that the harvest time it
[1:37:42] means the original seed that was planted
[1:37:45] it is now
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:52] displayed. That is when you you know
[1:37:54] that's the harvest.
[1:38:00] The disciples they were praying every
[1:38:05] day moving from home to
[1:38:08] home. What we are doing is close to
[1:38:13] that home
[1:38:15] sales. But may God give us grace. We
[1:38:18] make it more than
[1:38:20] that because I believe we are
[1:38:24] growing until we go back
[1:38:28] fully until the very seed that was
[1:38:34] sown. It's
[1:38:37] manifested. And why were they doing
[1:38:40] those things? Because they had a zeal
[1:38:42] for God.
[1:38:47] They had
[1:38:49] zeal. You hear a brother is going to
[1:38:51] stand here to
[1:38:54] preach. You pray for him. You can't wait
[1:38:56] to hear what God is going to speak to
[1:39:00] you. What do you have in store for
[1:39:04] me? Hallelujah. May God give us that
[1:39:12] very
[1:39:14] now I see I will not even
[1:39:17] finish. So if God gives me
[1:39:20] time and
[1:39:22] allows we shall continue with this
[1:39:25] judgment
[1:39:28] seal just these 10 minutes
[1:39:31] remaining. Let's talk about it.
[1:39:36] What's this judgment
[1:39:38] seal? This the sixth
[1:39:43] seal. And what's the sixth
[1:39:46] seal? It is after the
[1:39:53] bride. That's
[1:39:56] true. But
[1:39:59] also that is the time when it will be in
[1:40:01] its full power.
[1:40:08] Hallelujah. Now we see that uh uh the
[1:40:13] sixth the prophet
[1:40:15] says in the the sec about the second
[1:40:18] world
[1:40:20] war that it was the tender hand of
[1:40:26] Jehovah driving the Jews back to their
[1:40:29] homeland.
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:34] And remember Israel and the
[1:40:38] church. If this tender hand of
[1:40:43] Jehovah under the influence of the sixth
[1:40:47] seal, the judgment seal, the
[1:40:52] tribulation, if it was driving the Jews
[1:40:55] back to their
[1:40:58] homeland, there is something that is
[1:41:00] doing to our
[1:41:03] souls. And then I'll read this say that
[1:41:14] Okay, I didn't put it all here, but says
[1:41:17] in the third exodus say that how
[1:41:20] sometimes it looks
[1:41:24] real of the way that people
[1:41:28] suffer, but it still it's the tender
[1:41:32] hand of
[1:41:35] Jehovah leading his little
[1:41:38] children. We thank you
[1:41:42] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But up in
[1:41:46] that
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:48] message that God had to harden the heart
[1:41:55] of
[1:41:56] Hitler to be
[1:42:00] rough, the children of
[1:42:03] Israel. Was it a good thing?
[1:42:06] It's not a good thing. It's not a good
[1:42:10] experience. But yet, it was a tender
[1:42:12] hand of
[1:42:15] Jehovah had mercy on
[1:42:17] them to drive them to their homeland to
[1:42:21] to eat on the tree of
[1:42:26] life. So there is something it is
[1:42:29] playing in our soul.
[1:42:33] The prophet says that there is
[1:42:35] tribulation in your
[1:42:39] soul. There is always
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:44] tribulation. And now
[1:42:48] uh I can read for you this
[1:42:52] scripture. I'm sorry I'm using the phone
[1:42:57] so it is disturbing me here.
[1:43:16] Okay, it's fine. But you know the
[1:43:18] scripture, the Bible where says
[1:43:23] that talks about persecution and
[1:43:29] tribulation how it is
[1:43:33] part of
[1:43:35] salvation. Hallelujah. So God use it is
[1:43:39] always the tender
[1:43:42] hand of
[1:43:44] Jehovah. When you get
[1:43:47] problems, there's tribulation in your
[1:43:51] souls. But now I want
[1:43:53] you I'm soon closing. I want you closing
[1:43:57] towards these two kinds of people.
[1:44:03] Everyone under the influence of that
[1:44:06] seal.
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:13] Everyone is the seal of
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:17] judgment. And when the judgment
[1:44:20] comes, how do you
[1:44:23] respond? We see this judgment, the sixth
[1:44:26] seal.
[1:44:28] Cain came under the influence of this
[1:44:30] sixth seal one
[1:44:33] [Music]
[1:44:35] time. And how did he respond? How did he
[1:44:41] react? He said, "Oh, this is too
[1:44:45] much than I can
[1:44:49] bear." And now remember the prophet
[1:44:52] says that this
[1:44:54] seal seal
[1:44:57] reveals the
[1:45:00] seventh. It leads us to the
[1:45:04] seventh meaning that the dimensions come
[1:45:08] together. So it means that the ministry
[1:45:11] of the
[1:45:13] bride. It is to bring the sixth and the
[1:45:16] seventh
[1:45:20] together. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:24] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Okay, let me
[1:45:27] read for you this quote. I've remembered
[1:45:29] their
[1:45:31] quote the seven seals and the the
[1:45:35] seventh
[1:45:36] seal said but it will be revealed in
[1:45:41] that
[1:45:43] day in the
[1:45:46] hour that is supposed to be
[1:45:49] revealed. Now we all know that the
[1:45:51] seventh seal was not revealed.
[1:45:56] If we are to
[1:45:58] say, but was it not
[1:46:02] revealed? The prophet say that it's not
[1:46:05] for the
[1:46:09] public.
[1:46:12] Hallelujah. It is for who? It's for the
[1:46:15] bride, for an
[1:46:18] individual. Hallelujah. It's for an
[1:46:20] individual.
[1:46:22] And then he say that we find that the
[1:46:24] sixth
[1:46:26] seal has been open to
[1:46:30] us. We see it and we know that this
[1:46:34] seventh seal cannot be broke to the
[1:46:36] public.
[1:46:43] But again say until the hour
[1:46:47] arrives until the
[1:46:50] day. Which day is that? Write it down.
[1:46:54] I'm not going to read it. That's John
[1:46:59] 14:20. Why in that
[1:47:03] day you will
[1:47:05] know that
[1:47:08] I am in
[1:47:10] you and you in me.
[1:47:14] Friends, that's the seventh
[1:47:17] seal. There lies your seventh seal.
[1:47:23] It's the seventh
[1:47:24] seal where the bride is married together
[1:47:29] with the
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:34] husband. Where heavens embraces the
[1:47:37] earth.
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:42] Meaning that the one, two, three
[1:47:49] dimensions one, two, three, six married
[1:47:52] with the
[1:47:59] seven. It is all about the switching of
[1:48:05] dimensions. Hallelujah. And now we see
[1:48:07] that we all ought to come under the
[1:48:10] influence of the sixth
[1:48:15] seed. There are many things
[1:48:18] there under that se but I will not go
[1:48:21] through
[1:48:22] them. Unless God gives
[1:48:25] time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But we
[1:48:28] see that when it comes we see that
[1:48:31] Isaiah also came under the influence of
[1:48:33] the six.
[1:48:36] How did he
[1:48:38] respond? He broke down and says, "Wo is
[1:48:43] me." And then we see also this woman at
[1:48:46] the
[1:48:47] well. Actually, this story is
[1:48:51] interesting because it is in it's the
[1:48:54] bride
[1:48:56] story. The prophet
[1:48:58] says it's in the fourth gospel.
[1:49:02] [Music]
[1:49:04] You remember the ego from our previous
[1:49:07] the ego John?
[1:49:11] Okay in the fourth chapter of
[1:49:14] John sixth how of the
[1:49:18] day and then here comes the the son of
[1:49:24] man. And what did he do the son of
[1:49:27] man? He started
[1:49:30] revealing the
[1:49:32] seals to her. One, two, three, four,
[1:49:36] five, six
[1:49:41] men. And when she saw
[1:49:46] uh when she saw the
[1:49:52] sixth six revealed to her the
[1:49:57] seventh because now remember the prophet
[1:49:59] said that the seventh he is always the
[1:50:02] one
[1:50:05] revealing he's the one
[1:50:07] revealing God created in six
[1:50:12] days where is the
[1:50:14] seven creator
[1:50:18] hallelujah praise the Lord and now we
[1:50:22] also see back to our story of
[1:50:25] Ruth and
[1:50:28] Opa.
[1:50:29] Ruth, we see
[1:50:33] 666. And then we see that he uh this
[1:50:40] Boaz he gave her six measures of
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:46] B. He gave
[1:50:49] her the seventh
[1:50:53] The seventh is always
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:50:57] hidden and the seventh is to do with
[1:51:01] marriage is to do with Adam and
[1:51:05] Eve. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that's
[1:51:08] you understand what the Bible says that
[1:51:10] if even if we
[1:51:13] suffer all these sufferings are not
[1:51:15] compared.
[1:51:20] When we are fully combined with the
[1:51:25] seven, when we are back beyond the
[1:51:27] curtain of
[1:51:29] time and when we are switch the
[1:51:34] dimension, we cannot remember. But
[1:51:36] remember, it's
[1:51:38] needed is needed. That's why the Bible
[1:51:42] says that the children of God, they
[1:51:44] don't
[1:51:47] worry. Worrying it is a spirit.
[1:51:51] It's the
[1:51:52] devil and the devil means
[1:51:56] lying. By the word devil means
[1:52:01] lies. He is always lying to
[1:52:04] us. You get? So these sufferings we need
[1:52:08] them
[1:52:11] friends. But when we get
[1:52:15] them because now the Bible gave us a
[1:52:18] warning and gave us the solution to
[1:52:24] this. Oh, let's read the book of James.
[1:52:28] Let me read this
[1:52:30] one. James chapter
[1:52:33] 5. When you're under the influence of
[1:52:35] this judgment, the judgment of
[1:52:39] God,
[1:52:42] Here he says
[1:52:44] that 58 from 8 say that be also patient
[1:52:53] uh establish your
[1:52:56] hearts for the coming of the Lord is
[1:52:59] draweth nigh.
[1:53:03] Grudge not one against
[1:53:06] another,
[1:53:08] brethren, lest ye be
[1:53:11] condemned. Behold, the judge standeth
[1:53:13] before the
[1:53:16] door. Now, this was the
[1:53:19] warning. I'll read for you the
[1:53:22] solution later
[1:53:24] on. Now what was he meaning by grudge
[1:53:30] not? Because God remember God to bring
[1:53:35] you under the influence of the six judge
[1:53:40] seal. Sometimes he can use your
[1:53:42] brethren. We are
[1:53:45] brothers because we are humans.
[1:53:51] Now for
[1:53:53] example, maybe you engaged to the
[1:53:57] sister and the sister is engaged to
[1:54:01] you or maybe you are doing with a
[1:54:04] certain brother or some other person
[1:54:07] business or of the
[1:54:12] sort as you know
[1:54:15] death and then maybe things happen. this
[1:54:18] brother hurts
[1:54:23] you. Remember God uses these testing
[1:54:28] moments. Remember I told you last
[1:54:31] time that there these four living
[1:54:33] creatures guarding the throne of
[1:54:38] God. You don't just go enter in there.
[1:54:43] You have to be tested first
[1:54:46] and hallelujah. And then God watches
[1:54:49] you.
[1:54:52] Hallelujah. I've given you just an
[1:54:53] example. There are many many
[1:54:56] things. But first of all, we should not
[1:54:58] be
[1:55:02] worried worried about
[1:55:05] rent, worried about what to
[1:55:08] eat, worried about the cares of this
[1:55:10] world.
[1:55:13] never and there is a secret I'm
[1:55:17] giving that but there is nothing comes
[1:55:20] to the
[1:55:23] believer without going through the
[1:55:26] secret desk of Jehovah for
[1:55:31] signature for him to
[1:55:34] sign everything he's aware of
[1:55:38] them now after knowing
[1:55:41] that it means no
[1:55:45] worry. No
[1:55:47] worry because worrying is a
[1:55:50] devil. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[1:55:54] sister breaks your
[1:55:57] heart. God watches how are you going
[1:56:02] to you are under that
[1:56:06] influence. How are you responding?
[1:56:11] The sister breaks your
[1:56:12] heart because she's a human
[1:56:15] being. The brother breaks your
[1:56:18] heart. But brother, we already went for
[1:56:22] introduction. Friends, there is nothing
[1:56:27] happens without going through the desk,
[1:56:30] secret desk of
[1:56:32] Jehovah. Everything is in
[1:56:35] control. Hallelujah. Everything is in
[1:56:38] control.
[1:56:39] And now remember God uses these
[1:56:43] tribulations to drive you to your
[1:56:46] homeland. Hallelujah to position
[1:56:50] you. And now the prophet say that the
[1:56:52] sixth seal is the burning down of the
[1:56:56] earth. And now if it's the burning down
[1:56:59] of the
[1:57:00] earth then it means is the burning down
[1:57:03] of our bodies.
[1:57:09] It's burning down of
[1:57:13] ourselves. It's burning
[1:57:15] down. And it is the tender hand of
[1:57:21] Jehovah of
[1:57:23] Jehovah that has given you these
[1:57:26] trials to judge you and to see whether
[1:57:28] you stand the test of
[1:57:31] time. Are you
[1:57:33] worthy for the tabernacle of God?
[1:57:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] And whenever we receive these
[1:57:42] tribulations,
[1:57:46] uh James told us, be patient. Number
[1:57:50] one, establish your
[1:57:53] hearts. Grudge
[1:57:57] not. Don't keep someone in your
[1:58:01] heart because someone hurt
[1:58:04] you. It was the tender hand of
[1:58:07] [Applause]
[1:58:10] Jehovah to test
[1:58:12] you and to see whether you are
[1:58:15] worthy to stand the test of time.
[1:58:21] You remember the book of Joel said uh he
[1:58:24] said that I
[1:58:26] send my
[1:58:33] armies but God called them my
[1:58:36] armies. What was
[1:58:40] [Music]
[1:58:43] that? To do
[1:58:46] what? To eat up the
[1:58:49] church. the church of Christ, but it's
[1:58:52] God's
[1:58:54] army such that he can rebuild it, he can
[1:58:57] position it
[1:59:00] again in the full
[1:59:04] stature of who Jesus
[1:59:07] is. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we
[1:59:10] see that those were the armies of
[1:59:13] [Music]
[1:59:15] God. But again, we ought to bring it to
[1:59:17] an individual
[1:59:21] There is something going
[1:59:23] on. There is revelation that we are
[1:59:28] receiving. And every day in our
[1:59:31] life, we receive this new
[1:59:35] revelation. I mean we
[1:59:38] grow. Are you
[1:59:42] growing? And friends if you feel I will
[1:59:45] give you an idea.
[1:59:49] If you feel maybe you are being caught
[1:59:51] up in some kind of sort of
[1:59:57] loudian behind the walls of
[1:59:59] [Music]
[2:00:02] Jericho, don't be left behind. Don't
[2:00:04] allow
