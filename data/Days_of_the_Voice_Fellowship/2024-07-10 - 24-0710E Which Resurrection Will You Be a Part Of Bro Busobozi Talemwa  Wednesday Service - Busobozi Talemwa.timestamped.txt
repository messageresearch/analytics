[36:18] you amen so um we I'm having some I will
[36:24] call it a significant message I want to
[36:25] share with with the church tonight hell
[36:31] this week you know usually I share
[36:33] different parts of scripture with
[36:35] different young people throughout the
[36:40] week I usually
[36:42] do so but sometimes most times I I I get
[36:46] inspired to elaborate it more in the
[36:51] [Music]
[36:52] service so there's this one that asked
[36:54] me uh I think it was brother Dixon yeah
[36:57] asked me about the
[37:01] resurrection asking me um different
[37:05] details regarding the
[37:09] Rapture and and um you know how many
[37:13] raptures are we going to
[37:15] have how many resurrections are we going
[37:18] to
[37:19] have and you know different things
[37:23] pertaining to each of
[37:26] those I answered him but tonight I want
[37:29] to maybe go a little bit further and
[37:31] expound also share a few things from the
[37:36] message and what I'm sharing on tonight
[37:39] is which Resurrection will you be a part
[37:45] of so you see here in John chapter
[37:49] 5 um Jesus is
[37:54] speaking and it appears he's talking of
[37:57] two two different
[38:01] resurrections but as a matter of fact
[38:04] this is the same
[38:07] Resurrection which we call the second
[38:10] Resurrection as we shall see
[38:13] later because in this
[38:16] Resurrection we see that there are those
[38:18] going to be
[38:20] judged and there are those who of course
[38:23] who are going to be judged unto
[38:24] damnation condemnation and those who
[38:26] will be given life
[38:31] so when we talk about this resurrection
[38:34] that the Bible is speaking of in John
[38:38] 5 that has nothing to do with a
[38:42] [Music]
[38:43] bride and as a matter of fact uh if you
[38:46] read um we'll begin with u Revelation
[38:52] 20 if you have time you please go and
[38:55] read the whole chapter of
[39:00] Revelations very interesting
[39:03] chapter it speaks of what is going to
[39:06] happen especially beginning with the
[39:09] Millennium or beginning with the uh
[39:12] after the
[39:17] Rapture because here is the order of
[39:23] events these are prophetic events that
[39:25] are the Bible speaks of
[39:30] whether you are conscious about it or
[39:33] not whether people believe it or
[39:36] not these are things that are going to
[39:40] happen the Bible has um talked about
[39:45] these things very
[39:48] openly and God has sent his servant
[39:51] William Bram in this end
[39:54] time to expound it
[39:58] for us to be able to understand and to
[40:00] be able to place these events in their
[40:05] timeline so and the while events are
[40:07] moving
[40:09] on people either know these things or
[40:12] they don't know some know but they
[40:13] behave as if they don't
[40:18] know I would not want us to behave as if
[40:21] we do not
[40:23] know because these things are going to
[40:26] happen
[40:28] and to those who knew and they found in
[40:31] a
[40:33] crossroad and they are found on the
[40:34] wrong side of the
[40:36] road they would be the most
[40:40] miserable because they would have known
[40:43] everything but they would have missed
[40:45] out on the opportunity to be on the
[40:46] right
[40:49] side so we see that as long as man is
[40:52] still having life on Earth living
[41:02] because Jesus Christ himself comes back
[41:04] again to the
[41:06] Earth we actually sing that song and we
[41:08] says that the Lord is coming back to
[41:10] Earth
[41:12] again the Lord is coming back to Earth
[41:15] again Satan will be bound a thousand
[41:18] years and we will have no tempter
[41:22] then after Jesus shall come back to now
[41:26] you know there we are or rather we are
[41:28] singing about the
[41:30] Millennium because you know when Jesus
[41:33] comes back
[41:35] again the Bible says he came riding on a
[41:37] white
[41:39] horse and he was riding behind him were
[41:42] thousands thousands of his
[41:46] Saints and you know those are they that
[41:48] had already gone in the Rapture
[41:51] before they will be the ones to come
[41:53] back down with
[41:55] him and together with him set up a
[41:59] kingdom in this world we shall never be
[42:02] defeated by any
[42:04] [Music]
[42:06] man and he will be the
[42:09] king of kings truly now
[42:12] physically right right now he is
[42:15] spiritually the King of
[42:18] Kings right now he's ruling
[42:22] spiritually but then he will rule even
[42:24] physically on Earth
[42:28] he will have actually a physical
[42:30] headquarters on
[42:33] earth oh praise the name of the Lord on
[42:37] the
[42:39] city man
[42:41] Zion amen he would set up his
[42:44] headquarters he will set up his kingdom
[42:47] and he will rule out of
[42:50] there he will rule the whole
[42:52] world there will be those who would be
[42:56] the uh the
[42:57] um should I call it the
[43:01] remnants of the of the old
[43:04] world and those will be
[43:07] ruled actually the Bible says they will
[43:10] multiply as the sand of
[43:13] sea so quickly there will be so
[43:16] many they will fill the whole world but
[43:20] during the whole time there will be no
[43:23] sin there will be no
[43:25] fornication there will be no adultery
[43:28] there will be no Ste or no thieves there
[43:32] will be no drinking and getting drunk
[43:36] there will be no drug
[43:38] abuse you know why because aen Jesus
[43:43] himself amen will be the king of the
[43:46] earth not only that the devil will be
[43:49] bound for the whole
[43:53] time because there is no way Jesus can
[43:55] rule in the world when the devil is
[43:57] still also ruling in the
[43:59] [Music]
[44:01] world right now the devil is
[44:05] ruling right now it is Satan
[44:08] Isen right now it is so difficult for us
[44:11] to serve
[44:13] God because you know we we have forces
[44:16] coming against us day by
[44:19] day forces coming our
[44:22] mind even now as we are
[44:24] preaching you know forces are attacking
[44:27] mind
[44:29] you're it is here we are just over
[44:32] fighting with it every
[44:34] day and some you know you know give
[44:38] up others give up and
[44:40] go but but you know but some of us
[44:45] stay Hallelujah and on suay said we are
[44:48] not of
[44:50] those that draw back we are not of those
[44:53] that draw back we are of those that
[44:56] press on
[44:59] God Amen and we know that you know the
[45:02] devil will be bound a thousand
[45:06] years and there will be no temp then
[45:09] there will be no sin then there will be
[45:12] no you know power of Darkness there
[45:16] Satan will be bound in
[45:19] Chains and he will be in the bottomless
[45:22] pit and during that time we the bride
[45:27] shall be ruling with
[45:29] Christ out of the
[45:31] city and we shall rule the whole
[45:35] world
[45:37] hallu I cannot wait for that
[45:40] time and then after that comes the white
[45:45] Throne
[45:47] judgment after the uh the the the
[45:53] Millennium this is when this scripture
[45:55] of John 5 28 to 29 is going to be
[46:04] fulfilled you know he says Mar not at
[46:07] this for the hour is
[46:11] coming in the which
[46:15] all everybody say
[46:18] all did you see that brother which verse
[46:22] is
[46:25] that not at
[46:27] this for the hour is
[46:30] coming in the which
[46:32] all not PS but
[46:36] all
[46:38] all that are in the
[46:42] graves shall hear his
[46:45] voice and they shall come
[46:47] forth that hour is coming how many
[46:51] believe this scripture that time is
[46:53] coming that day is coming
[46:58] all the rich and the poor The Young and
[47:01] the old the women and the men the black
[47:05] and the white and the red and the yellow
[47:08] all that are in the grave will hear his
[47:13] voice this is not the
[47:16] trumpet no this is not the trumpet of
[47:19] first
[47:21] Thessalonians this is another
[47:24] voice they will hear his voice calling
[47:26] out for
[47:28] it will be like the
[47:30] voice that Jesus used when he was
[47:33] calling Lazarus out of
[47:35] the say
[47:37] Lazarus come forth brother bam said if
[47:40] he had not called
[47:43] Lazarus all of them would have come
[47:46] out of their graves why because that is
[47:50] the same
[47:51] voice which will call them
[47:54] out says come out
[47:57] all of them will come out amen and
[48:02] now they that have done
[48:05] good they will get
[48:07] life and they that have done
[48:10] evil will get
[48:12] damnation follow me closely here now
[48:15] this is not the
[48:18] Rapture because in the Rapture not all
[48:22] Rise Up from the
[48:25] dead only the elect Rise Up from their
[48:30] gra amen but on this
[48:33] Resurrection which is the last
[48:36] Resurrection all the
[48:39] dead whether they died in Christ or
[48:43] not whether they were Believers or
[48:46] not they will all rise
[48:49] up so when we talk about the
[48:52] resurrection all shall rise
[48:57] all shall rise you remember when when
[49:02] when I think
[49:05] Mary they were talking about their
[49:08] brother and Jesus said he shall
[49:11] rise and they said yes we know he shall
[49:13] rise again said your brother will live
[49:17] again they said yes we know we know the
[49:20] last
[49:21] day they were talking about this day on
[49:25] that day
[49:27] he shall rise again he said no I'm not
[49:29] talking about
[49:31] that I am the resurrection and the
[49:34] life so in other words even today there
[49:38] are those going to
[49:39] rise before this day
[49:42] come just like rarus rose from the
[49:46] grave amen and whoever will
[49:49] rise in the
[49:51] resurrection in the first
[49:53] resurrection amen is already Rising
[49:55] today
[49:57] the resurrection is already taking
[50:00] place hallelujah praise the name of the
[50:04] Lord so which Resurrection will you be a
[50:06] part
[50:07] [Music]
[50:09] of now when you go to the Book of
[50:15] Revelation um we will go to vers
[50:20] [Music]
[50:21] 11 and I saw a great white throne
[50:30] and him that sat on
[50:32] it from whose face the earth and the
[50:34] heaven fled
[50:37] away and there was found no place for
[50:41] them and I saw the dead small and great
[50:44] stand before
[50:47] God and the books were
[50:50] opened and another book was
[50:53] opened which is The Book of Life and the
[50:56] day were judged out of those things
[50:58] which were written in the
[51:03] books according to their
[51:06] works and the Sea gave up the
[51:10] dead which were in it and the death and
[51:15] death sorry and Hell delivered up the
[51:18] dead which were in
[51:22] them and they were judged every man
[51:24] according to their works
[51:29] and death and hell were cast into the
[51:31] Lake of
[51:34] Fire this is the second
[51:37] death and whosoever was not found
[51:40] written in the Book of
[51:44] Life was cast into the Lake of
[51:48] Fire praise the name of the Lord now the
[51:51] prophet says there will be both the
[51:54] righteous and the unrighteous in the
[51:56] judge
[52:00] it says so this righteous will not be
[52:03] the
[52:06] bride amen are you are you are you
[52:10] here the righteous will not be the
[52:13] bride wait did you hear what I just
[52:17] say there will be on the day of
[52:20] judgment there will be the
[52:23] righteous and the unrighteous
[52:26] on the day of judgment according to what
[52:28] we have just read
[52:30] here but you know the righteous in here
[52:33] he says will not be the
[52:38] bride for the
[52:40] bride sits with him in the
[52:45] Judgment are you hearing me the
[52:48] righteous is I mean the bride is not
[52:50] here to be
[52:53] judged by the time the bride is already
[52:58] gone in the
[53:00] Rapture come down with
[53:02] him Ru with him for 1,000
[53:06] years and now he's seated with him on
[53:08] the
[53:11] throne to judge the living and the
[53:15] dead hallu and so when we talk about the
[53:18] righteous and the
[53:20] unrighteous by this time among them the
[53:23] bride is not
[53:28] the bride is together with Christ on the
[53:30] Judgment
[53:34] SE I want you to understand what it
[53:38] takes to be the
[53:39] bride follow closely Now 1 Corinthians 6
[53:47] ver2 do do you not know that the saint
[53:51] shall judge the world and if the world
[53:54] shall be judged by you are ye unworthy

[1:04:26] he will be coming down to the
[1:04:28] Earth to to set up his
[1:04:32] kingdom but the bride will be with him
[1:04:37] to minister to him as a wife ministers
[1:04:40] to
[1:04:41] hus are you following me are you
[1:04:45] following
[1:04:47] me and
[1:04:52] 10,000 times 10,000
[1:04:57] stood before
[1:05:01] himu thousands
[1:05:04] thousands ministered to
[1:05:07] him the few the small
[1:05:10] number
[1:05:12] El
[1:05:15] 10,
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:19] 10 that's a great great big
[1:05:22] number stood before
[1:05:27] the Judgment was
[1:05:30] set and the books were
[1:05:33] open this is the same thing we've read
[1:05:35] in
[1:05:37] Revelation the Judgment was
[1:05:39] set and the books were
[1:05:42] open in Revelation he said and another
[1:05:45] book was
[1:05:47] open which was The Book of
[1:05:52] Life see it is the same scene
[1:05:57] for the thousands thousands who are
[1:05:59] ministering to him are the
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:03] bride for who ministers the husband but
[1:06:05] the
[1:06:07] wife are you following me so far but the
[1:06:11] question now
[1:06:13] arises why are these righteous ones in
[1:06:16] the
[1:06:19] Judgment not the bride but the other
[1:06:22] ones
[1:06:23] were why are they now in
[1:06:27] judg now listen to me Church some people
[1:06:32] think only Believers of the message will
[1:06:35] get eternal
[1:06:40] life that is not
[1:06:43] correct only Believers of the
[1:06:47] message are in the
[1:06:50] bride now not only in our
[1:06:54] generation but in all Generations even
[1:06:56] before
[1:06:58] ours the body of the Bride is not in one
[1:07:03] generation it is in the old gentle
[1:07:05] Church
[1:07:08] ages right from
[1:07:10] ephes
[1:07:13] to to all other
[1:07:16] ages
[1:07:17] and what happened God was raising a
[1:07:22] church there was an
[1:07:24] elect out of each
[1:07:27] generation out of each age those will be
[1:07:30] among the chosen elect the
[1:07:34] few but those will he take heed on every
[1:07:39] word they will
[1:07:42] hear they will never inject their
[1:07:46] ideas they will preach the message the
[1:07:48] way it
[1:07:49] is they will believe it the way it is
[1:07:53] they will believe the messengers of
[1:07:54] their age
[1:07:56] they will accept the word of their
[1:07:58] day as long as the word said it they
[1:08:01] believe
[1:08:03] it that is the
[1:08:05] bride and they automatically have
[1:08:08] eternal
[1:08:10] life because they deserve
[1:08:13] it but because they have been granted
[1:08:18] it
[1:08:19] Faith through
[1:08:21] Grace so there is no way the bride can
[1:08:25] go to
[1:08:26] hell no no completely no
[1:08:29] way their names are in another
[1:08:34] compartment of The Book of
[1:08:37] Life called the Lamb's Book of
[1:08:41] Life those ones are the one the lamb
[1:08:44] gave his blood
[1:08:48] for they would not have made it
[1:08:50] otherwise without this
[1:08:53] blood but the Blood
[1:08:56] makes the difference for
[1:08:58] them I am one of
[1:09:00] them blood makes the
[1:09:03] difference I Was So
[1:09:05] Unworthy but the blood made the
[1:09:08] difference I am what I am today because
[1:09:12] of the
[1:09:13] blood Hallelujah and then we see but
[1:09:17] that there are
[1:09:19] others that are good that even we shall
[1:09:23] see that they even get eternal life
[1:09:28] but they are not in the
[1:09:32] bright did you hear that so not
[1:09:35] everybody who doesn't go in the Rapture
[1:09:37] will go to
[1:09:46] hell not everyone who doesn't go in the
[1:09:49] Rapture will go to
[1:09:52] hell no there are many people
[1:09:56] who will actually be in
[1:09:58] heaven having previously missed the
[1:10:05] Rapture well of course it depends what
[1:10:07] you call
[1:10:10] Heaven because what what I'm referring
[1:10:12] to as heaven now is eternal
[1:10:15] life are you following
[1:10:18] me
[1:10:19] but don't make conclusions
[1:10:22] yet follow me closely so the question
[1:10:26] now
[1:10:27] arises why are these righteous ones in
[1:10:30] the
[1:10:32] Judgment there is no other place that
[1:10:34] they can come
[1:10:37] up for there are but two
[1:10:42] resurrections and since they could not
[1:10:44] qualify for the first
[1:10:48] resurrection they must have come up in
[1:10:50] the
[1:10:52] second remember the only thing that
[1:10:54] qualifies you to be in the first
[1:10:59] resurrection is the is being the bright
[1:11:01] the
[1:11:02] bright only the bride will be
[1:11:06] interrupted are you following me now
[1:11:10] okay brother M make sure you move with
[1:11:11] me because I don't want to distract the
[1:11:12] people all right so follow me closely
[1:11:14] here now since they could not qualify
[1:11:16] for the first resurrection they must
[1:11:17] come up in the
[1:11:21] second which is a resurrection unto
[1:11:24] judgment
[1:11:28] now the ones who qualify for the first
[1:11:33] resurrection the
[1:11:35] bride are not in the
[1:11:41] Judgment they didn't get
[1:11:43] it the ones who
[1:11:46] qualify for the first
[1:11:49] resurrection they are the
[1:11:52] bride they will never be in the judgment
[1:11:57] and he gives us a scripture here John
[1:11:59] 524 very verily I say unto you he that
[1:12:03] Hearth my word and believeth on him that
[1:12:07] sent
[1:12:08] me
[1:12:10] has everlasting
[1:12:13] life that is the believer is already the
[1:12:17] recipient of eternal
[1:12:22] life which he the believe
[1:12:25] has in his possession
[1:12:34] now they didn't get it still he that
[1:12:38] believeth in my
[1:12:40] word in the
[1:12:42] message in the word in the revealed word
[1:12:46] he that
[1:12:47] believes has
[1:12:51] Everlasting what does it mean it is not
[1:12:54] something in the future
[1:12:58] in
[1:13:00] Thea the moment you
[1:13:02] believe you possess Eternal
[1:13:07] lifeu I am a possessor of eternal
[1:13:11] life I cannot be dragged into
[1:13:16] hell that is not even a
[1:13:19] thought not a chance the devil has no
[1:13:24] chance when he stand before a real J
[1:13:28] believer the devil did not have a
[1:13:31] chance when he stood before
[1:13:34] job because job was a
[1:13:36] Believer he could not have a
[1:13:39] chance the only thing that could make
[1:13:43] the devil have power over
[1:13:46] job was if job unbelieved the word of
[1:13:52] God that's why his wife kept on telling
[1:13:55] you are suffering too much cast God and
[1:13:59] be separated from him
[1:14:03] Forever cast God and
[1:14:05] die death is a total
[1:14:09] separation meaning cast
[1:14:11] God and go to
[1:14:14] hell but he did not he held on to the
[1:14:17] world he
[1:14:19] regardless regardless of feelings
[1:14:22] regardless of what he saw regardless of
[1:14:24] what he felt
[1:14:25] regardless
[1:14:27] of to the
[1:14:29] world and because of that the devil did
[1:14:32] not have a
[1:14:34] chance the devil has no chance amen over
[1:14:38] you brother over you
[1:14:40] sister your loved ones as long as you
[1:14:43] can
[1:14:44] believe every word of
[1:14:47] God the devil has no
[1:14:50] chance hallu over your
[1:14:53] soul that's why We Sing It is
[1:15:00] Well my
[1:15:02] soul because the enemy cannot
[1:15:07] do you can take my my
[1:15:11] body burn it up kill it take my spirit
[1:15:14] and hurt
[1:15:16] me but my soul is in the hands of
[1:15:20] God no one has access
[1:15:26] Hallelujah and shall not come into
[1:15:29] condemnation you already possess eternal
[1:15:31] life
[1:15:33] now and you will not come into
[1:15:37] condemnation shall not come into
[1:15:41] judgment is what it really
[1:15:44] means you will not come in the
[1:15:47] Judgment but but is
[1:15:52] passed but you have passed
[1:15:56] sorry
[1:15:59] permanent from
[1:16:02] Death unto life oh you need to shout a
[1:16:07] big you have already passed
[1:16:13] from you can say it over
[1:16:15] yourself I'm already passed
[1:16:18] from to
[1:16:20] life amen I cannot die I am a permanent
[1:16:25] possessor of eternal
[1:16:29] life yes hallelujah amen but notice
[1:16:34] carefully Jesus must have yet another
[1:16:36] group in
[1:16:40] mind who at a certain
[1:16:44] Resurrection will receive eternal
[1:16:50] life mine I have it
[1:16:52] now I'm just waiting for the rapture
[1:16:56] but there are those who shall receive it
[1:17:04] later be
[1:17:06] careful not to be very very
[1:17:11] judgmental when someone disagrees with
[1:17:14] you you are going to
[1:17:18] hell be
[1:17:21] careful be
[1:17:23] careful love everybody
[1:17:25] it makes me love
[1:17:28] everybody everybody this is what this
[1:17:31] old time religion
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:34] does these people they will receive
[1:17:37] it at the
[1:17:39] resurrection not having previously
[1:17:42] received it as a member of the Bride
[1:17:44] because they were never member of the
[1:17:51] Bride praise God these are they the on
[1:17:55] that we reading about
[1:17:57] here in John 5 which says Mar not at
[1:18:01] this not the hour is coming in the which
[1:18:06] all that are in the grave shall hear his
[1:18:10] voice and shall come forth and they that
[1:18:13] have done good unto the resurrection of
[1:18:16] the of life so those are the Righteous
[1:18:19] now they will get
[1:18:22] life Hallelujah and they
[1:18:25] that have done
[1:18:26] evil the resurrection of
[1:18:29] dation now we all know that John 528 is
[1:18:32] not the
[1:18:35] Rapture for only the dead in Christ will
[1:18:38] rise from the graves at the time along
[1:18:41] with a living bride who is still on the
[1:18:45] earth this is not the
[1:18:48] Rapture Only The Dead In
[1:18:51] Christ will arise from the graves
[1:18:55] and at that time according to first
[1:19:01] Thessalonians the dead in ch rise the
[1:19:04] ones who are still
[1:19:06] living in Christ shall be
[1:19:09] changed and they will go to meet the
[1:19:11] Lord in the
[1:19:13] air that's the Rapture of the
[1:19:16] Bride but this other one of John
[1:19:19] 5 is for the other group
[1:19:25] but it says in John
[1:19:28] 5828 that
[1:19:30] all are going to come forth from the
[1:19:35] Grau but when you read first
[1:19:38] Thessalonians
[1:19:41] 4:6 follow closely here it says for the
[1:19:43] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:19:45] with a
[1:19:49] shout and that shout has already gone
[1:19:52] forth is the message of the hour
[1:19:56] and the voice of the Archangel and the
[1:19:59] Trump of
[1:20:01] God and the dead in
[1:20:03] Christ shall rise
[1:20:06] fast this is not for
[1:20:08] all this Resurrection is for a
[1:20:11] few I am one of the
[1:20:14] few then we which are
[1:20:17] alive and
[1:20:19] remain who the
[1:20:21] Believers shall be caught up together
[1:20:25] with them in the cloud to meet the Lord
[1:20:29] in the air and so shall
[1:20:31] we ever be with the
[1:20:34] Lord why because from that time we will
[1:20:38] never be
[1:20:41] separated we will go to heaven come back
[1:20:44] to
[1:20:45] earth everywhere with
[1:20:49] him my
[1:20:51] God are you not so happy because of that
[1:20:53] promise
[1:20:55] but it says here in John 5 that all are
[1:20:59] going to come forth from the
[1:21:01] grave this is the very same resurrection
[1:21:03] that is spoken of in Revelation
[1:21:08] 2011 where in the dead were brought
[1:21:11] before the Lord and judged according to
[1:21:13] their
[1:21:16] works and all whose names were not in
[1:21:20] the Book of Life
[1:21:24] then they were cast into the Lake of
[1:21:27] Fire now we now F the
[1:21:30] question as to why they should be given
[1:21:33] eternal life at the
[1:21:37] Judgment since the Epistles seem to
[1:21:41] conclusively point out that one must
[1:21:43] possess the spirit of Christ or perish
[1:21:46] [Music]
[1:21:55] the
[1:21:56] Epistles when you read
[1:21:59] it it kind of shows as if to
[1:22:03] say you either possess the spirit of
[1:22:06] Christ or
[1:22:08] perish or go to
[1:22:11] hell there are many who would preach
[1:22:13] that kind
[1:22:15] of so though it seems
[1:22:18] thus we must not discredit the words of
[1:22:21] Jesus
[1:22:24] who most pointedly sets forth that there
[1:22:26] are some found in the Book of
[1:22:32] Life who will either receive eternal
[1:22:35] life before the general Resurrection or
[1:22:42] after now Paul does not evade this
[1:22:47] Truth for he most clearly says in
[1:22:49] Philippians 31 if by any means I might
[1:22:53] attain unto the resurrection
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:22:59] now this statement is very special here
[1:23:03] we all know that we we all going to be
[1:23:06] in a in a
[1:23:09] resurrection whether we want it or
[1:23:12] not all will be
[1:23:14] resurrected so Paul could hardly be
[1:23:16] saying if by any means I might attain to
[1:23:18] a resurrection of the Dead
[1:23:25] uhuh the truth of the matter is he is
[1:23:28] not saying that he is saying if by any
[1:23:31] means I might attain to a to the out
[1:23:34] Resurrection from the among the
[1:23:44] dead this is not the attaining to the
[1:23:47] general or second
[1:23:51] Resurrection but attaining to the first
[1:23:54] resurrection
[1:23:57] so in other words Paul was listen listen
[1:24:00] Paul was trying to say there is two
[1:24:03] different
[1:24:05] resurrections there is the
[1:24:09] resurrection which is the first
[1:24:11] resurrection for those ones who go in
[1:24:13] the
[1:24:14] Rapture and then there's the second
[1:24:17] resurrection of
[1:24:20] everybody out of which others will be
[1:24:24] given
[1:24:25] life and others will be damed
[1:24:29] forever but Paul was saying he wants to
[1:24:33] be a part of the first
[1:24:38] resurrection blessed and holy is he that
[1:24:41] has part in the first
[1:24:46] resurrection that's why the Book of
[1:24:48] Revelation
[1:24:50] says such the second death
[1:24:54] no
[1:24:55] power but they shall be Priests of God
[1:24:58] and of
[1:24:59] Christ and shall re with him for
[1:25:06] a hallelujah amen glory to
[1:25:10] God I me we are writing Revelation
[1:25:13] chapter
[1:25:15] 20 that's where we are reading
[1:25:18] that just in case you want to hear it
[1:25:22] again vers four
[1:25:25] and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon
[1:25:27] them the Judgment was given unto them
[1:25:29] and I saw the souls of them that were
[1:25:31] beheaded for the witness of Jesus and
[1:25:33] for the word of God and which had not
[1:25:35] worshiped the Beast neither his image
[1:25:37] neither had received his Mark upon their
[1:25:39] foreheads or in their hands and they
[1:25:41] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
[1:25:43] years but the rest of the Dead lived not
[1:25:46] again until the thousand years were
[1:25:48] finished this is the first resurrection
[1:25:51] blessed and holy is he that has part in
[1:25:54] the the first resurrection on such the
[1:25:57] second death has no power but they shall
[1:25:59] be Priests of God and of Christ and
[1:26:01] shall reign with him a thousand years my
[1:26:03] god listen
[1:26:05] to I am going to be in the first
[1:26:09] resurrection Hallelujah the first
[1:26:12] resurrection is not for everybody it is
[1:26:16] for the
[1:26:17] elect it is for the
[1:26:19] few it is for the bride
[1:26:24] Revelation
[1:26:28] 197 the marriage of the
[1:26:31] Lamb is come and his
[1:26:35] wife has
[1:26:40] made Christ has a
[1:26:44] wifeu when you Maring you don't marry
[1:26:47] everyone in
[1:26:50] the you marry
[1:26:52] one the chosen one
[1:26:55] out of all of
[1:26:57] them you all know when you are very busy
[1:27:01] looking for a
[1:27:03] wife it is very difficult for you
[1:27:06] brothers because you you don't want to
[1:27:09] make a
[1:27:10] mistake you want to marry someone that
[1:27:13] is perfectly your
[1:27:17] Ty someone who will agree with
[1:27:20] you someone who will do what you want
[1:27:23] someone who submit to you someone who
[1:27:26] will be a mother to
[1:27:27] Children someone who will be a good wife
[1:27:30] to
[1:27:30] you in the same way Jesus Christ is not
[1:27:35] going to marry any woman he
[1:27:39] finds church is a symbol of a woman or
[1:27:43] woman is a symb of a
[1:27:46] church are you following me tell your
[1:27:49] neighbor are you
[1:27:51] following all right listen now praise
[1:27:54] the name of the Lord so we see here that
[1:27:58] now the woman is a type of the
[1:28:01] church but we have so many churches
[1:28:05] today that claim to be the wife of
[1:28:09] Christ but their
[1:28:12] character does not show
[1:28:14] Christ their life does not represent the
[1:28:19] word they have rejected him in their
[1:28:23] works
[1:28:24] in their words in their songs in their
[1:28:29] worship and they
[1:28:31] claim to be the wife of
[1:28:34] Christ but on that day he says he will
[1:28:38] say unto them I never knew
[1:28:41] you workers of
[1:28:44] iniquity with their false
[1:28:48] baptisms with their false teachings
[1:28:50] of
[1:28:53] trinities and all these things there are
[1:28:56] many Creeds and
[1:28:59] dog and they claim to be the wife of
[1:29:03] Christ and he would say I never knew
[1:29:06] you yes they had the portion of
[1:29:09] anointing upon
[1:29:11] them could do some signs and
[1:29:14] wonders and when they come to him they
[1:29:17] will tell him but we have done many
[1:29:21] signs we have shown many signs
[1:29:24] performed many
[1:29:26] miracles in your name are you hearing me
[1:29:29] church and he will tell them I never
[1:29:32] knew you do words of iniquity yes you
[1:29:36] did the
[1:29:37] Miracles as far as my word is
[1:29:40] concerned my
[1:29:42] Doctrine I never knew
[1:29:45] it he will put them
[1:29:50] away but today they claim to be their
[1:29:54] wife of
[1:29:56] Christ you find all these
[1:29:59] sisters so
[1:30:01] called you know painting their
[1:30:05] faces with all these
[1:30:08] fingers i p young men who marry women
[1:30:11] like
[1:30:13] that because can even never make a good
[1:30:16] wife let alone being the wife of
[1:30:22] Christ women in the church
[1:30:25] show the spiritual state of that
[1:30:29] church phally
[1:30:31] speaking it shows the
[1:30:33] spiritual the way they dress the way
[1:30:36] they talk the way they behave it
[1:30:40] shows the spiritual state of the
[1:30:43] church so now they have rejected Christ
[1:30:47] in every good work in every good
[1:30:50] doctr so they won't be the bride
[1:30:54] no they won't be the
[1:30:56] bride because the bride hears and
[1:30:59] follows every
[1:31:03] word how many
[1:31:08] remember was
[1:31:10] beautiful nice and everything but when
[1:31:13] the king said please call me
[1:31:18] queen I want to display
[1:31:21] her before my people
[1:31:25] she said go tell the
[1:31:28] king I have my own
[1:31:31] party that's how the church is
[1:31:36] today in their
[1:31:38] sanctuaries they are doing their own
[1:31:42] parties it's not for Christ they have
[1:31:45] rejected him they have denied him with
[1:31:49] all their sexy
[1:31:51] dances completely in
[1:31:55] B it is not our God and do you know what
[1:31:59] they claim they claim that they trying
[1:32:02] to attract the Young Generation to
[1:32:06] God let me tell you you younger people
[1:32:10] we will not do stupid things to attract
[1:32:12] you to Jesus
[1:32:15] Christ no we are going to teach the word
[1:32:19] we are going to preach Holiness we are
[1:32:22] going to teach the doctrine of Christ
[1:32:24] if that can pull
[1:32:27] to none of
[1:32:29] his Hallelujah that's why in this church
[1:32:34] and in any belie believer's church
[1:32:35] around the
[1:32:36] world we don't pull and beg people to
[1:32:39] come to
[1:32:42] church we go to the radios we
[1:32:44] preach we go on the streets we preach
[1:32:48] come in chch we preach the word will
[1:32:50] pull those who were meant for it
[1:32:55] Hallelujah are you hearing me are you
[1:32:58] hearing me so if you come here and don't
[1:33:01] like what you're
[1:33:02] hearing we can't force you to
[1:33:04] stay but if you love the
[1:33:07] world you cannot go
[1:33:09] away even if we tell you go away you
[1:33:13] will say where to whom can we go who has
[1:33:16] the words
[1:33:18] of oh are you not so glad because of the
[1:33:22] word praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:33:25] the true church the bride will be her
[1:33:30] that believes
[1:33:32] every she will be
[1:33:37] an whereever he
[1:33:40] is she wants to
[1:33:44] be she wants to put up a fist for
[1:33:48] him hallelujah amen are you not so happy
[1:33:52] to have a feast of the Everywhere
[1:33:55] You amen you invite him in your
[1:33:59] house every evening every morning you
[1:34:03] invite him at the family
[1:34:06] altar come to the feast come to the
[1:34:10] feast and every time you invite him he
[1:34:13] will come even now you have invited him
[1:34:17] and whenever you invite him he will show
[1:34:20] up and what happens at the end of it
[1:34:24] he will give you the desires of your
[1:34:28] heart
[1:34:30] Hallelujah the desire of our hearts the
[1:34:34] longing of our
[1:34:35] hearts is not money is not power is not
[1:34:40] presti no the longing of our heart is to
[1:34:44] be with him is to go in the
[1:34:48] Rapture is it the Ling of your
[1:34:51] heart is to fly away
[1:34:56] Hallelujah that's why when we sing songs
[1:34:58] about the
[1:34:59] Rapture if you
[1:35:01] notice we always get
[1:35:03] happy because something on the
[1:35:06] inside is calling for
[1:35:11] it
[1:35:14] Fly you begin to feel so
[1:35:17] happy because
[1:35:20] your your spiritual body
[1:35:23] is calling for
[1:35:26] it so the bride is not
[1:35:30] part of the second
[1:35:33] Resurrection the second Resurrection is
[1:35:36] going to be for
[1:35:38] those who had previously not attained
[1:35:41] eternal
[1:35:44] life for us we attain eternal
[1:35:48] life by belief of the
[1:35:51] truth we have already passed from
[1:35:53] judgment
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:55] life we can never be judged day
[1:35:58] therefore we cannot even come before the
[1:36:00] wife
[1:36:03] judgment our judgment is
[1:36:06] finished
[1:36:08] on forget about those people who tell
[1:36:12] you all of us are going to
[1:36:13] come not me I will not come before the
[1:36:17] white
[1:36:18] Jud I will not be there
[1:36:21] sorry if you tell them
[1:36:24] that and they said no all of us are
[1:36:26] going to come before the
[1:36:29] Jud tell them you don't know what you're
[1:36:31] talking about the Bible tells me there
[1:36:34] is there for now no judgment no
[1:36:37] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[1:36:41] they have already passed from Death un
[1:36:44] life I already have eternal
[1:36:47] life now I possess in my soul I cannot
[1:36:53] die to
[1:36:54] I've already died once when I di to sin
[1:36:59] and I'm born again by the power of
[1:37:02] the amen I'm only waiting for
[1:37:05] one body change and I come out of this
[1:37:09] body that's what I'm waiting
[1:37:13] foru so now we notice
[1:37:18] here um in
[1:37:20] Philippians Apostle Paul was saying
[1:37:24] there is two
[1:37:25] resurrections but he was saying I want
[1:37:27] to be part of the
[1:37:30] first because blessed and holy is
[1:37:34] he is part in the first
[1:37:38] resurrection the second death has no
[1:37:43] power do you know what the second death
[1:37:47] is the second
[1:37:49] death is permanent destruction of the
[1:37:58] are you hearing me some people think
[1:38:01] there is eternal
[1:38:03] hell listen to me there is nothing like
[1:38:06] eternal
[1:38:08] hell so somebody say oh we will burn
[1:38:12] tonight there is nothing like
[1:38:14] that if they are going in Hell which is
[1:38:19] eternal also means they have received
[1:38:21] eternal life
[1:38:25] think about
[1:38:26] it we only have one type of
[1:38:30] life with is
[1:38:32] zo God is life and God is life you can
[1:38:37] only be attained by receiving
[1:38:41] it he only he either gives it to
[1:38:45] you as a royal
[1:38:47] [Music]
[1:38:48] Grant if you are in the bride you
[1:38:51] receive it as a royal
[1:38:55] he gives it to you by somehow doing
[1:38:59] things that pleases
[1:39:00] [Applause]
[1:39:02] him but that will be up to him on the
[1:39:05] Judgment
[1:39:08] Day and if you allow me I'll show you
[1:39:10] here a few types of people that will
[1:39:12] receive
[1:39:15] it they receive it he will give it to
[1:39:18] them and only those and ask the bride
[1:39:23] will have eternal
[1:39:25] life all the rest will be thrown into
[1:39:29] Hell and Hell be thrown into the Lake of
[1:39:33] Fire and for how long shall they
[1:39:36] burn they will burn forever and
[1:39:40] ever but ever and ever has an
[1:39:45] end it's not a tel maybe 10,000
[1:39:49] years maybe one billion years
[1:39:53] of it all he will do away with
[1:39:57] things because the Bible now in
[1:40:00] Revelation
[1:40:02] 31 he says behold I saw a new Heaven and
[1:40:07] a new
[1:40:08] Earth old Earth and old
[1:40:12] Heaven pass away with a great
[1:40:15] noise I do not think the devil will have
[1:40:19] a part in the new
[1:40:21] heaven I do not things that in the new
[1:40:25] Earth and new heav we shall have a
[1:40:30] hell so he will do away with
[1:40:35] everything praise the name of the Lord
[1:40:38] so Paul was saying I want to be a
[1:40:41] part of this blessed first
[1:40:44] resurrection so I don't enter into the
[1:40:47] second
[1:40:50] death the first resurrection has nothing
[1:40:52] to do with second
[1:40:57] death that is at the end of the Thousand
[1:41:02] Years when all the rest of the Dead live
[1:41:06] again you know the dead are
[1:41:10] dead during the 1,000
[1:41:13] years even at the end of the Thousand
[1:41:16] Years the Bible says there will
[1:41:20] be the the devil lose that
[1:41:25] he will come in the people who will be
[1:41:26] living
[1:41:28] at temp them go and attack the
[1:41:32] city and and while they attack it fire
[1:41:35] will come from burn all of them so but
[1:41:40] then after that all the
[1:41:43] dead will rise
[1:41:45] again they will be
[1:41:47] judged according to their works
[1:41:54] there are so many
[1:41:55] people who say it doesn't matter what
[1:41:58] you
[1:42:01] do they are
[1:42:03] right but they are the wrong people
[1:42:05] to claim those
[1:42:12] words those ones only belong to the
[1:42:18] bride because apart from the
[1:42:21] bride everybody else will be judged
[1:42:27] their so it matters what they
[1:42:32] do but to the
[1:42:35] bride it's a royal
[1:42:40] Grant by
[1:42:43] faith through
[1:42:45] Grace the only thing it tells the
[1:42:47] bride only believe
[1:42:50] only just believe leave the rest for
[1:42:54] me believe only believe only as long as
[1:42:59] you believe my
[1:43:01] word leave your sins for the blood to
[1:43:05] come leave rest for me I am going in
[1:43:10] into the Rapture by a royal
[1:43:15] Grand not by my
[1:43:18] good it does not
[1:43:21] count Hallelujah
[1:43:24] to the bride but to the rest they will
[1:43:28] be
[1:43:29] judged according to their
[1:43:31] works as for what was written in the
[1:43:34] Book of
[1:43:37] Life and we see there are several
[1:43:40] others for example there are those who
[1:43:42] were good to the
[1:43:46] Brethren they will go
[1:43:50] in I I don't have time to go into the
[1:43:52] details
[1:43:53] there are others who had the souls under
[1:43:57] the
[1:43:59] altar those ones they were the
[1:44:02] Jews under the revelation of the fif
[1:44:06] seal we see the souls under
[1:44:09] the they were
[1:44:12] crying oh Lord how
[1:44:16] long they were crying for
[1:44:19] vengeance who are these These are Jews
[1:44:23] who were
[1:44:24] killed by Hitler and and and and these
[1:44:28] other people that put them in the
[1:44:29] concentration
[1:44:33] camp and you know these people were are
[1:44:37] not having the testimony of
[1:44:39] Jesus but these people believed in God
[1:44:45] according to the testimony they
[1:44:49] held because of that they will be given
[1:44:52] etal life
[1:44:55] no details no time for details then
[1:44:58] comes the other group The foolish
[1:45:03] virgins they will also receive eternal
[1:45:06] life there are many people whose names
[1:45:09] were on the book of
[1:45:11] life but they were
[1:45:13] removed but these ones their names was
[1:45:16] not
[1:45:17] removed they were foolish virgins they
[1:45:20] couldn't come up in the rapture
[1:45:23] but they were given eternal
[1:45:26] life because they were virgins
[1:45:28] in oh my there are many things we can
[1:45:30] look
[1:45:31] at there's also the 144,000
[1:45:35] Jews who are
[1:45:38] servants who go everywhere where the
[1:45:40] where the bridegroom
[1:45:43] is those even go
[1:45:45] in before the white Throne
[1:45:49] judgment so you see friends there are
[1:45:51] many other groups
[1:45:54] that receive etal
[1:45:55] life but I'm so thankful I'm not part of
[1:45:58] those
[1:45:59] group because those
[1:46:02] groups it will be very
[1:46:04] difficult for them to get
[1:46:08] it to to be accepted because of your
[1:46:13] Works who can do works that will move
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:18] God it will Sur be another level of
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:21] Grace higher level than
[1:46:25] ours but ours is so
[1:46:28] easy only
[1:46:30] believe hallelujah amen and you will go
[1:46:33] in the
[1:46:34] resurrection praise God God bless you
[1:46:38] bless you can stand up on your
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:41] feet praise God is in the Lord good
[1:46:46] church that he can give us
[1:46:49] Grace and a royal Grant
[1:46:56] that we can be able
[1:46:58] to get this that we have
[1:47:02] today etal
[1:47:04] life let us seeing I'm thinking of the
[1:47:08] rupture but if you're going to be part
