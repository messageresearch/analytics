[29:25] hold you may postpone i will give my
[29:27] life to christ tomorrow the other day

[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:53] our national anthem
[1:22:08] b
[1:22:15] there is therefore now
[1:22:17] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:22:20] christ jesus
[1:22:21] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:22:23] the spirit
[1:22:25] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:22:27] christ
[1:22:29] jesus has made me free from the law of
[1:22:31] sin and death
[1:22:32] for what the law could not do in that it
[1:22:35] was weak
[1:22:36] through the flesh god sending his own
[1:22:39] son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:22:41] and for
[1:22:43] and for sin
[1:22:44] condemned sin in the flesh
[1:22:47] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:22:50] be
[1:22:51] fulfilled in us
[1:22:53] who walk not after the flesh but
[1:22:57] after the spirit so the righteousness of
[1:23:00] the law is going to be fulfilled in us
[1:23:03] who do not walk after the flesh but
[1:23:04] after the spirit i mean for they that
[1:23:07] are after the flesh do do mind the
[1:23:10] things of the flesh but they that are
[1:23:12] after the spirit
[1:23:13] the things of the spirit

[1:27:29] sister stella
[1:27:58] to be a part of the great what god is
[1:28:01] doing across this country
[1:28:07] um you know when you translate the
[1:28:09] message or the bible and you give it to
[1:28:11] the people and print it and give it to
[1:28:13] the people it's not a small one
[1:28:20] and we have been chosen by god to be a
[1:28:23] part of it
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:09] and we had what brother team was
[1:29:11] preaching here on wednesday hey that's
[1:29:12] how you organize
[1:29:14] approximately you have to prosper oh you
[1:29:16] know
[1:29:18] amen i mean
[1:29:19] stick with the wife
[1:29:21] and especially help in giving out the
[1:29:23] world
[1:29:26] the lord has to prosper
[1:29:29] amen i mean so we are blessed to be a
[1:29:31] part of that great work
[1:29:35] i mean we have brethren who coming from
[1:29:37] eastern from western from even somewhere
[1:29:39] right to me from rwanda they want
[1:29:41] messages even ethiopia and we print that
[1:29:44] in our small office there turina
[1:29:46] uganda
[1:29:47] obama
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:55] so we just give all the glory to the
[1:29:56] lord
[1:30:01] http by the grace of god i want to speak
[1:30:04] on case dismissed
[1:30:17] and last sunday i spoke on this the
[1:30:21] scene case sunday
[1:30:26] and i was speaking as a
[1:30:28] um as an attorney or something like that
[1:30:32] on what
[1:30:33] yesterday i took you i mean on sunday
[1:30:35] took you in a courtroom
[1:30:40] uh and we we looked at several
[1:30:42] interpretations of the law netherlands
[1:31:01] this young man here by the joel we also
[1:31:03] did speak something about this organ
[1:31:07] isaac also
[1:31:09] and i know to all of us this uh this is
[1:31:11] the word of god
[1:31:42] chicken but which one would because we
[1:31:44] believe it is life
[1:31:48] amen i mean so i'm going to request each
[1:31:50] of you to be very attentive
[1:32:28] that that sounds so well
[1:32:31] if you were in if you had a case
[1:32:35] and the judge says
[1:32:38] dismiss
[1:32:49] no doubt we are going to incorporate law
[1:32:52] and grace
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:33:04] for now no condemnation to them which
[1:33:07] are in christ jesus
[1:33:11] christ
[1:33:13] so it means that there is therefore now
[1:33:16] condemnation to them that are not in
[1:33:19] christ
[1:33:24] so the sin will be imputed unto them
[1:33:28] that are not in christ
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:38] another person also the lord will catch
[1:34:40] him according to the past president it
[1:34:43] takes
[1:34:44] to associate
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:11] and what did he do
[1:36:14] he had to pay the price of sin the
[1:36:17] accessory motivated because of course
[1:36:20] according to the law
[1:36:22] if you as a sinner can pay the price of
[1:36:25] sin you are no longer a sinner
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:33] and what was the price of sin
[1:36:51] so imagine if each of you has to pay for
[1:36:53] your sin cutting no lab are you a
[1:36:54] singing
[1:36:55] body no baby you have to be crucified
[1:36:58] crucified crucified
[1:37:02] but when jesus came on the scene
[1:37:05] [Music]
[1:37:10] [Music]
[1:37:18] then
[1:37:32] the circumstances of this case have
[1:37:34] changed in song
[1:37:38] and this case cannot be judged oh
[1:37:41] judgment cannot be passed according to
[1:37:43] the past precedent
[1:37:46] oh my
[1:38:42] proof
[1:38:44] yes god bless you here is the evidence
[1:38:50] this man is not a sinner
[1:38:53] the sentence was already paid
[1:39:34] because the circumstances have changed
[1:39:52] oh
[1:40:04] yes
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:55] and i saw another mighty angel
[1:42:57] come down from heaven close to the cloud
[1:43:00] and the rainbow was upon his head and
[1:43:02] his feet was as it were the sun and his
[1:43:04] feet as pillars of fire nine
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:32] as a matter of fact he said that his
[1:43:33] hair his head was had a rainbow and his
[1:43:36] face was as it were the sun and his
[1:43:38] fearless spirits of fire
[1:43:44] okay
[1:43:48] i want you to see something here
[1:43:52] it should be okay okay just just a
[1:43:54] moment give me a moment here i'll get it

[1:43:58] aha look at revelation chapter 1 verse
[1:44:00] 14.
[1:44:05] quickly now
[1:44:07] what does it say there
[1:44:09] you can actually begin from
[1:44:12] from uh
[1:44:14] 12 and i turned to see the voice that
[1:44:17] spoke with me and being turned i saw
[1:44:19] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[1:44:21] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[1:44:23] the son of man closed with a gummy down
[1:44:26] to the foot and got about with the pups
[1:44:29] with the golden goddess his head and his
[1:44:31] hairs were white like wool as white as
[1:44:35] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[1:44:38] fire
[1:44:39] okay
[1:44:45] so
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:46:24] sometimes we speak things and we think
[1:46:26] everybody understands
[1:46:28] the internet until you might be taking
[1:46:29] it yet not everybody understands what
[1:46:31] we're talking about
[1:46:33] so i want to show you here in just a
[1:46:35] moment
[1:46:37] how a judge looks
[1:46:53] address where in jakarta
[1:46:55] um
[1:46:57] i will not show you everything in this
[1:46:58] entirety but at least i will show you
[1:47:00] something which you can be able to
[1:47:01] relate with
[1:47:07] all right i mean okay just a moment here
[1:47:10] can you please put that up for me
[1:47:13] okay
[1:47:14] i think everybody can see that
[1:47:21] are you with me brother aburuganda truly
[1:47:23] finna can i have that on the screen
[1:47:26] uh-huh
[1:47:28] look
[1:47:28] the judge
[1:47:30] always wears that white
[1:47:32] wig wig i am ballet
[1:47:47] he's going to give a fair
[1:47:49] again that sort of sango going so do you
[1:47:51] see that
[1:47:52] yeah how many have you ever seen that
[1:47:56] so it shows that it's a good judge it's
[1:47:59] a righteous judge
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:17] and his eyes were white like wool
[1:48:20] amen
[1:48:21] as white as snow
[1:48:25] and his eyes were at the flame of fire
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:51] [Applause]
[1:49:39] and be able to die on the cross
[1:49:42] he thought that was just the boy of the
[1:49:45] of the father
[1:49:48] no he was not just the son or you're
[1:49:50] whatever you want god himself
[1:50:48] is
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:51:32] some of them still believe they are
[1:51:34] under the law
[1:51:35] everybody
[1:51:37] wants you i'm a taker and others think
[1:51:39] they are free from the law
[1:51:43] that is without understanding everybody
[1:51:56] [Music]
[1:52:00] what was the intention of the law
[1:52:04] you need to understand that the law is
[1:52:06] righteous
[1:52:12] that the law is righteous
[1:53:11] on the way no
[1:53:13] in your nature of birth
[1:53:18] you could only be under the law oh a sad
[1:53:21] word in a bed once you were taken
[1:53:23] because you were sinners
[1:54:07] of the of the righteousness of the law i
[1:54:10] think that way everyone sees
[1:54:13] the signs of your take the lord jailed
[1:54:16] you cathy
[1:54:19] and therefore the lord became the
[1:54:20] strength
[1:54:25] the law magnified your sin for all to
[1:54:27] see
[1:54:32] so we in our natural ability
[1:55:15] you feel negative about it
[1:55:19] you feel as if it is alone
[1:55:22] women should not wear trousers
[1:55:28] those are legalized
[1:55:53] why do you feel negative to what the
[1:55:55] word the bible says
[1:56:24] [Music]
[1:56:50] [Applause]
[1:57:23] because the things you used to like to
[1:57:25] do
[1:57:29] according to the flesh
[1:57:32] you can no longer do that
[1:57:36] your flesh was pulling on you to go and
[1:57:39] fornication
[1:57:44] are they seeing me
[1:57:46] is the pasta
[1:58:18] you will
[1:58:33] the bible in verse 2 says for the law of
[1:58:36] the spirit of life in christ jesus has
[1:58:40] made me free from the law of sin and
[1:58:42] death
[1:58:45] is
[1:58:58] foreign
[1:59:15] [Applause]
[1:59:44] as i used to do
[1:59:45] i do them no more
[1:59:47] it was a glad day when i was born again

[2:33:18] one day apostle paul was not married
[2:33:23] he said it doesn't mean because i don't
[2:33:25] have the strength like a woman
[2:33:32] i
[2:33:39] you know so some of these things you
[2:33:41] need to die to them category
[2:33:48] that's why even the bible comes to talk
[2:33:49] about widows
[2:33:52] he says it's better for our world
[2:33:57] but he says but the younger ones
[2:34:14] foreign we need to die to the flesh
[2:34:22] for the good that i would i do not but
[2:34:25] the evil wish i would not that i do now
[2:34:28] if i do that which i would not
[2:34:30] it is no more that
[2:34:32] more i that do it but sin that dwelleth
[2:34:34] in me
[2:34:35] i find then a law

[2:34:39] present with me
[2:34:41] that is a law
[2:34:43] i mean that
[2:34:44] i would that that i find a law that when
[2:34:47] i would do good evil is present with me
[2:34:53] myself
[2:34:54] we have read verse 21
[2:34:56] where
[2:35:09] you know each of us has that piece of
[2:35:11] cane and that piece of ability

[2:35:38] holy spirit the holy spirit will prevent
[2:35:42] you from being uh oh stop by the flesh
[2:35:49] otherwise the flesh can overtake you
[2:35:53] and control your life
[2:35:58] you find people that are completely
[2:36:00] overtaken by the flesh
[2:36:06] they decided
[2:36:21] masters bad food ganger man yeah they
[2:36:24] begin taking it and they are always up

[3:04:31] it
[3:04:33] all by
[3:04:45] and i've taken you for a little while
[3:04:47] but
[3:04:48] allow me to read one more quote is that
[3:04:49] okay
[3:04:52] that's about 20 percent of you i take it
[3:04:54] that all of you are saying i should stop
[3:04:56] right now but i was just requesting only
[3:04:58] for one more quote whether whether you
[3:04:59] say it
[3:05:00] yes or no i'll just have to read it
[3:05:02] anyhow
[3:05:06] you see whatever when that seed was
[3:05:09] promised in the garden of eden and
[3:05:10] seeker you'll be assuming
[3:05:12] adding
[3:05:13] the devil
[3:05:15] listen please listen
[3:05:17] the devil has constantly
[3:05:19] sit down right about being able to
[3:05:22] destroy that i guess i can't see
[3:05:25] you
[3:05:27] and the death of abel and the coming of
[3:05:29] says was just a death value
[3:05:45] that seed must continue
[3:05:49] the devil try to destroy it
[3:05:52] he said i thought i heard you when i
[3:05:54] destroyed happen
[3:05:57] i thought i heard you when i
[3:06:16] that's what the devil told satan when
[3:06:18] well that's what
[3:06:20] that's what the devil told jesus when
[3:06:22] jesus arrived in hell
[3:06:41] are you all hearing me now
[3:06:44] remember this is the same one who
[3:06:45] dismissed our case
[3:06:49] the devil has always wanted to get that
[3:06:51] seat
[3:06:53] so this is before the resurrection of
[3:06:56] jesus christ
[3:06:58] and the devil is faced with him face to
[3:07:01] face
[3:07:05] and the prophet says
[3:07:07] i can hear him say this is jesus
[3:07:51] whenever i reach this moment i feel nice
[3:07:53] because i believe the devil might have
[3:07:55] been shaking at that moment
[3:07:59] when we hear these words and we read it
