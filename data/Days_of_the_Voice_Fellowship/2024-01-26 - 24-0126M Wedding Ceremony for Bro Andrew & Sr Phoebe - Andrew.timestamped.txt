[1:31:34] it marriage is Honorable and holy
[1:31:41] EST instituted by God In The Garden of
[1:31:46] Aiden it was there that the Lord God
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:50] said it is not good that the man should
[1:31:54] be
[1:31:56] alone Eve was then fashioned from a reib
[1:31:59] of Adam and given to him for a
[1:32:11] wife and it was thus recorded therefore
[1:32:14] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:32:16] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[1:32:19] shall be one flesh
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:29] it is
[1:32:30] sanctioned and and honored by Jesus's
[1:32:32] Christ's Presence at the marriage in K

[1:33:47] enter by being joined together as one
[1:33:51] [Music]

[1:33:56] there before we
[1:33:58] continue If any man can

[1:41:00] preeminence
[1:41:02] Lord in the name of Jesus
[1:41:05] Christ
[1:41:06] amen so now to many of you that know
[1:41:10] me I'm a I'm I'm Evangelistic in my way
[1:41:14] of delivery and
[1:41:18] preaching and uh so evangelist kind of
[1:41:21] tend to talk fast and sharp words and
[1:41:23] things like
[1:41:28] that but uh today I'll try to put myself
[1:41:32] together and and be a bit
[1:41:37] religious and so I have a a lot of I
[1:41:41] have my my notes written
[1:41:43] down and I'll try to stick with them so
[1:41:46] I don't lose the
[1:41:49] thought where the the Lord gives me a
[1:41:51] little inspiration then that will be for
[1:41:53] the benefit of the people that are
[1:41:58] here so I also appreciate our brother
[1:42:02] Jon and the church at evening light
[1:42:04] bright
[1:42:06] Tabernacle uh that actually raised
[1:42:10] sister
[1:42:12] fibbe and now we are snatching her away
[1:42:14] from there to days of the voice
[1:42:19] Fellowship but still here at the altar
[1:42:23] we are together with evening
[1:42:25] light do you apprciate
[1:42:28] them amen we are going to begin with
[1:42:31] Hebrews
[1:42:34] 13:4 and what I'm speaking on today to
[1:42:36] you brother Andrew and sister
[1:42:40] fibbe is the basis of
[1:42:49] marriage
[1:42:51] I would be about 20 30 minutes but
[1:42:53] because of an interpreter maybe it will
[1:42:54] extend a bit but you bear with
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:59] us so the scripture says marriage is
[1:43:02] Honorable in
[1:43:06] all and B and
[1:43:09] defiled but warong and adulterers God
[1:43:12] will
[1:43:15] judge also in 1 Corinthians
[1:43:19] 138 it
[1:43:21] says charity never
[1:43:26] fails but whether there be prophecies
[1:43:29] they shall
[1:43:31] fail whether there be tongues they shall
[1:43:35] cease whether there be knowledge it
[1:43:37] shall vanish
[1:43:40] away and I realized I introduced
[1:43:43] everybody else but I did not introduce
[1:43:44] myself my name is
[1:43:46] Pastor the past of days of The
[1:43:49] Voice
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:54] fellow and so I'm going to divide this
[1:43:56] thought into two
[1:43:58] [Music]
[1:44:00] points and in form of
[1:44:03] questions number one What is
[1:44:07] marriage number two what is the basis of
[1:44:12] marriage so now I'll begin with the
[1:44:15] first one What is
[1:44:17] marriage it is more marriage is more
[1:44:20] important
[1:44:21] important than any other
[1:44:26] relationship except your relationship to
[1:44:29] Jesus
[1:44:32] Christ it is more important than your
[1:44:34] relationship with your
[1:44:39] parents than your
[1:44:41] in-laws it is even more important than
[1:44:44] the relationship with your
[1:44:48] pastor your brothers and your sister
[1:44:52] even than the one with your
[1:44:55] boss and many other relationships that
[1:44:58] you
[1:44:59] have it is more important than a
[1:45:04] vow it is deeper than just
[1:45:11] cohabitation it is richer than just a
[1:45:14] physical relationship
[1:45:19] alone on
[1:45:22] Earth that it is unlike any other
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:29] relationship sister phib you've been in
[1:45:31] many
[1:45:34] relationships meaning you have many
[1:45:38] relationships your father your P your
[1:45:42] your
[1:45:43] sisters your brothers your friends same
[1:45:47] with you your pastor your friends your
[1:45:50] is all these are
[1:45:54] relationship but marriage the marriage
[1:45:57] relationship you entering
[1:46:00] into it is higher than any relationship
[1:46:04] you have ever been
[1:46:08] in all those relationships
[1:46:13] fail
[1:46:15] relationship even this one can fail it
[1:46:18] fails many times but it is the most
[1:46:20] crucial one that you will ever be a part
[1:46:26] of it is not just a
[1:46:29] vow many people take a
[1:46:32] vow but in The Vow in itself is not
[1:46:35] staying
[1:46:39] power it is only
[1:46:42] obligation Real Marriage goes well
[1:46:44] beyond the
[1:46:48] vow there is great power in
[1:46:52] marage for a man to be
[1:46:56] complete for a man to be
[1:46:59] fulfilled you were not complete
[1:47:03] brother now you are going to be
[1:47:06] complete now you're going to be
[1:47:09] fulfilled at first you were
[1:47:11] not you were not even
[1:47:14] settled you are now going to be complete
[1:47:19] fulfilled
[1:47:21] that's the power in
[1:47:23] marriage in Genesis
[1:47:26] 2:18 and the Lord God said it is not
[1:47:29] good that the man should be alone I will
[1:47:31] make him and help me for
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:41] him and out of the ground the Lord God
[1:47:44] formed every beast of the field and
[1:47:45] every foul of the air and brought them
[1:47:47] unto Adam to see what he would call them
[1:47:50] and whatsoever Adam called every living
[1:47:52] creature that was the name
[1:48:06] thereof and Adam gave names to all
[1:48:09] cattle and to the fall of the air and to
[1:48:11] every beast of the field and for Adam
[1:48:13] there was no was not found and help M
[1:48:16] for
[1:48:19] him
[1:48:24] I want you to notice that there is no
[1:48:26] help meat to be found
[1:48:35] among at men that seem more Charmed with
[1:48:38] hunting with farming even with they call
[1:48:41] it Safari
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:49] tours
[1:48:51] wife in Genesis 28 the Amplified version
[1:48:54] he
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:57] says now the Lord God say it is not
[1:49:02] good meaning it is not
[1:49:05] sufficient not
[1:49:07] satisfactory that the man should be
[1:49:10] alone I will make him a helper meat or
[1:49:17] suitable
[1:49:19] aded
[1:49:23] complimentary for
[1:49:26] him when the two enter into this
[1:49:28] marriage Union on a right
[1:49:33] basis it is a fulfillment of life's
[1:49:37] purpose both for the man and for the
[1:49:45] woman your life's
[1:49:48] purpose is being fulfilled to
[1:49:52] today that means if you're not married
[1:49:54] you have not yet fulfilled
[1:49:57] it outside
[1:49:59] this the union will always be lacking
[1:50:02] and eventually cannot
[1:50:07] stand you
[1:50:08] must you must enter into marriage on the
[1:50:11] right
[1:50:13] basis the Bible refers to her as a
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:19] helpmate
[1:50:22] she can comfort you like no other
[1:50:27] can the very first time a man takes her
[1:50:31] or you will take her to your
[1:50:34] bosom she Lees a spiritual
[1:50:41] imprint that no other can f that
[1:50:46] place her
[1:50:48] trust is to be
[1:50:51] treasured you must
[1:50:55] treasure
[1:50:57] weakness is to be
[1:51:00] respected her
[1:51:03] giving of
[1:51:05] herself is to be
[1:51:08] honored is to be
[1:51:10] honored her
[1:51:12] submission is to be
[1:51:15] cherished her
[1:51:17] obedience is to be adored
[1:51:22] there is great power in
[1:51:24] marriage for a wife to minister to her
[1:51:30] husband Proverbs 3110
[1:51:34] says who can find a virtuous
[1:51:39] woman for her price is far above
[1:51:44] rubies the heart of her husband does
[1:51:47] safely trust in
[1:51:48] her
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:51] so that he shall have no need of
[1:51:56] spoil she will do him good and not evil
[1:51:59] all the days of her
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:10] life here when he says he shall have no
[1:52:13] need of
[1:52:15] spoil I want you to listen to this
[1:52:17] brother and brother
[1:52:23] spoil
[1:52:25] gain which is
[1:52:27] acud from your industrious
[1:52:34] ways that you have the potential to make
[1:52:37] him
[1:52:40] Rich that's what a virtuous woman
[1:52:44] does anyone here that married a virtuous
[1:52:48] woman you can tell that since the day
[1:52:51] you got
[1:52:54] married it has been increase after
[1:52:58] increase a virtuous woman will make a
[1:53:01] man
[1:53:03] Rich a woman who is not virtuous Will
[1:53:05] Make A Man
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:09] Poor if a man has found a true
[1:53:13] wife God has given him the second
[1:53:16] greatest gift that a man could receive
[1:53:26] the first is
[1:53:28] salvation and God gave you the first
[1:53:30] brother
[1:53:32] Andrew now today God is giving you the
[1:53:35] second best gift that he
[1:53:40] has and that is a virtuous
[1:53:45] woman she is to be treated as
[1:53:48] such she is to be treasured above
[1:53:53] all all natural
[1:53:56] things above all your other
[1:54:00] accomplishments that's why we believe
[1:54:02] that a woman should never be beaten like
[1:54:04] a as if you're beating a
[1:54:09] dog matter of fact a man that beats his
[1:54:13] wife is not fit to be called a
[1:54:17] man and thank God for this
[1:54:21] message because in our church I've never
[1:54:24] even heard of any brother beating his
[1:54:29] wife brother Andre you have never heard
[1:54:31] me beating my
[1:54:33] wife if you come at my home when we
[1:54:35] don't know that you are
[1:54:38] around you will hear sweet sounds
[1:54:44] only you
[1:54:48] not because she's
[1:54:51] virtuous you treat her as
[1:54:53] such the only things to be valued in
[1:54:56] your
[1:54:59] life the only thing to be valued in your
[1:55:02] life apart apart from your
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:08] wife Sal
[1:55:11] itself amen it is
[1:55:14] salvation that Jesus Christ gave you
[1:55:17] then your wife and then everybody else
[1:55:20] can
[1:55:22] follow not your father not your uncle
[1:55:25] not your brother
[1:55:29] not even your
[1:55:32] children
[1:55:34] your she's a
[1:55:39] treasure and that's what marriage is and
[1:55:42] I want to talk to you now what's the
[1:55:43] basis of
[1:55:47] marriage in the next few moments
[1:55:50] second Corinthians
[1:55:54] 11:2 Paul would say for I am jealous
[1:55:57] over you with Godly
[1:56:01] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[1:56:06] husband that I may present you as a
[1:56:08] chest virgin to
[1:56:11] [Music]
[1:56:13] Christ there is something about
[1:56:18] chin
[1:56:21] virtue we're going to talk about that
[1:56:25] briefly let us first read Ephesians
[1:56:28] [Music]
[1:56:29] 5:2
[1:56:31] husbands love your
[1:56:34] wives even as also Christ loved the
[1:56:38] church and he gave himself for
[1:56:41] it that he might sanctify and cleans it
[1:56:44] with the washing of the Water by the
[1:56:48] word
[1:56:51] that he might present it to
[1:56:54] himself our glorious
[1:56:58] church so he chooses because the church
[1:57:01] is a
[1:57:03] wife we are the bride and Jesus Christ
[1:57:06] is our
[1:57:07] husband but he chooses us and then he
[1:57:11] nourishes
[1:57:13] us character within
[1:57:16] us to be a glorious Church God has given
[1:57:20] you a raw
[1:57:22] material she's not
[1:57:24] perfect there's no perfect
[1:57:27] marriage you mold it and make it perfect
[1:57:30] by
[1:57:32] your it is only the two of
[1:57:35] you and Jesus Christ you should be the
[1:57:39] one in this
[1:57:42] circle I'm talking about the best of
[1:57:44] marriage let me come
[1:57:46] now that he may presented to himself a
[1:57:48] glorious child
[1:57:51] church not having sport or
[1:57:54] wrinkle
[1:57:56] such should be
[1:57:58] holy and without
[1:58:01] blemish I always say if you see there is
[1:58:05] a problem with a
[1:58:08] woman in marriage the problem began with
[1:58:12] with a
[1:58:15] husband if you say your H your wife is
[1:58:18] bad
[1:58:20] it means you are also bad remember she's
[1:58:22] your
[1:58:23] reib she's a part of you when you
[1:58:29] say it means you also that
[1:58:36] same so so old men to love their
[1:58:40] wives as their own
[1:58:43] bodies amen and all of you who are
[1:58:45] married you must love your wives as your
[1:58:47] own bodies
[1:58:52] you know brother Andre that this is your
[1:58:54] [Applause]
[1:58:55] body It's actually an extension of
[1:59:00] you she was only lost in's
[1:59:05] house but you you found her and you are
[1:59:09] claiming at
[1:59:12] yourself he that loveth his
[1:59:15] wife loveth
[1:59:18] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[1:59:21] own
[1:59:23] flesh but nourishes and cherishes
[1:59:28] it even as the Lord the
[1:59:31] church so we are members of his
[1:59:34] body we are members of his flesh and of
[1:59:38] his
[1:59:39] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[1:59:43] his father and
[1:59:46] mother for what cause
[1:59:50] for this cause which we have talked
[1:59:52] about that is a part of
[1:59:55] you then shall a man leave his father
[1:59:57] and
[1:59:58] mother and shall be joined unto his
[2:00:02] wife and they to shall be one
[2:00:06] flesh this is a great
[2:00:09] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[2:00:11] and the
[2:00:12] church so we've talked about
[2:00:16] love before we talked about love talked
[2:00:19] about
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:22] virtue and I want to talk a little bit
[2:00:24] about virtue and then I continue here
[2:00:26] for a few
[2:00:27] [Music]
[2:00:29] more there are I've been talking to him
[2:00:32] mostly so I'll turn
[2:00:33] [Music]
[2:00:35] this there is nothing in the
[2:00:38] world like a
[2:00:41] woman a woman is
[2:00:44] special many
[2:00:48] females there's a female cow
[2:00:53] female
[2:00:56] fale and they all you know reproduce and
[2:00:58] you
[2:01:00] know in all the Creations God
[2:01:05] created there is nothing like a
[2:01:09] woman why God has given a woman three
[2:01:18] saes should never
[2:01:21] defile and these are number one sacred
[2:01:28] Womanhood what does that mean
[2:01:32] conduct around
[2:01:34] men the way she presents herself to
[2:01:38] others the way she
[2:01:40] dresses that is why on the wedding on
[2:01:42] every wedding
[2:01:46] day a real bride will cover herself like
[2:01:49] a sister has
[2:01:52] done she will be dressed in the real
[2:01:56] gown not the ones they're wearing
[2:01:59] today can you imagine they're wearing
[2:02:01] half
[2:02:04] gos the boobs is out the feet is
[2:02:09] out a woman's
[2:02:12] conduct before men the way she presents
[2:02:16] her body the way she dresses
[2:02:20] you know is a sacred virtue God has
[2:02:22] given to
[2:02:25] her and brother Andre I want to tell
[2:02:28] you seen sister f she has that Sac
[2:02:32] virtue of
[2:02:36] Womanhood but you see what do men these
[2:02:38] days look for what are they looking
[2:02:40] for they look for sex
[2:02:43] Queens someone who knows how to grow
[2:02:46] long
[2:02:47] nails
[2:02:50] and then paint
[2:02:51] them and then have those high heels and
[2:02:55] have a
[2:02:56] Min and they do and and show they say
[2:02:59] show what this they call it what they
[2:03:01] call it it is a church yes but I'll say
[2:03:03] because I have many young people here
[2:03:04] they call it
[2:03:08] Nash my brother here looked at me said
[2:03:10] oh Pastor you're going to say don't say
[2:03:12] [Music]
[2:03:14] it and younger men be looking for that
[2:03:17] those kind of things
[2:03:20] that kind of woman cannot make a good
[2:03:22] [Applause]
[2:03:24] wife you want a good wife look for one
[2:03:28] with sacred
[2:03:31] Womanhood who knows what it means to be
[2:03:34] a
[2:03:35] woman who knows how to cover herself
[2:03:38] up who knows how to keep herself as a
[2:03:42] daughter of
[2:03:45] God that's what man a good man should be
[2:03:48] looking for
[2:03:50] praise the name of the Lord and I'm sure
[2:03:53] sister phbe I've seen you dress I've
[2:03:56] seen you
[2:04:00] behave you find men out there at the
[2:04:03] places
[2:04:04] of they just behave anyhow around
[2:04:08] women especially women like you who are
[2:04:11] working
[2:04:14] class you know you you really married
[2:04:16] one who she has even a PhD
[2:04:22] rather
[2:04:24] UC but still she's has that Sac virtue
[2:04:27] of
[2:04:30] Womanhood not going around where you are
[2:04:32] working at and you're allowing men to
[2:04:35] just around with
[2:04:39] you if you have sa
[2:04:42] Womanhood you cannot allow a woman a man
[2:04:45] who is not your husband to touch you
[2:04:47] woman
[2:04:50] you wait a moment this belongs to my
[2:04:57] husband I hope you women will say Amen
[2:05:00] to
[2:05:02] that sister this body is it was the Lord
[2:05:05] is but now you are married now from
[2:05:07] today going to be
[2:05:10] your so after marriage Don't Say No No
[2:05:13] don't touch me
[2:05:15] for after to date is for your husband
[2:05:18] [Music]
[2:05:20] praise the Lord amen then comes the
[2:05:22] second
[2:05:25] virtue
[2:05:28] motherhood the way she h a
[2:05:33] husband by accepting to take the
[2:05:37] seed and giving him
[2:05:40] children raising them and respecting and
[2:05:43] submitting to
[2:05:46] him we don't have many mothers like that
[2:05:51] anymore but thank God we can stand here
[2:05:55] today and say we still have
[2:05:58] some true
[2:06:00] mothers if you're a true mother here
[2:06:02] shout amen so they can know you are
[2:06:06] there I wish I had time I would expound
[2:06:09] on
[2:06:10] each but I don't want to make it a
[2:06:12] preach a preachy I want this is a
[2:06:17] ceremony quickly go go on to make my
[2:06:22] points
[2:06:26] virtue
[2:06:29] virtue for a woman to be a
[2:06:33] virgin God has given these
[2:06:38] virtues she of
[2:06:42] them any of
[2:06:44] them to tell her husband before they
[2:06:47] married
[2:06:51] she would have
[2:06:53] to you know my
[2:06:55] dear you know some years
[2:06:58] ago something
[2:07:00] happened you have to say
[2:07:03] it according to the Bible if you don't
[2:07:06] say it and the man finds out
[2:07:09] later he has a right to put you
[2:07:13] away but these days these sacred
[2:07:16] virtues are no longer cherished in
[2:07:20] churches because the churches themselves
[2:07:22] are
[2:07:24] Backle it's more about making
[2:07:27] money is more about getting
[2:07:31] members instead of getting
[2:07:34] Souls that are going to be prepared for
[2:07:36] the coming of the
[2:07:38] Lord but I tell you if you want to see
[2:07:41] that a church is
[2:07:44] back look at the women in the
[2:07:47] church how they present
[2:07:50] themselves how they dress how they
[2:07:53] behave how they behave with boys
[2:07:57] around spiritually it will be the same
[2:08:01] thing but God still has
[2:08:04] Witnesses in Uganda and in many other
[2:08:07] parts of the
[2:08:09] world where churches will preach the
[2:08:14] truth and women will behave in the right
[2:08:17] way
[2:08:19] if you say that women can no longer
[2:08:23] marry when they still
[2:08:33] virgins what did you say Pastor
[2:08:37] yes we have heard of Our
[2:08:40] Testimony and this to say
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:46] public but to ask
[2:08:49] Believers it is something to brag
[2:08:52] about young man it is something to brag
[2:08:56] about for you say I will I will abstain
[2:08:59] until
[2:09:03] marriage marriage is not a curse it is a
[2:09:08] blessing butter and warong us God will
[2:09:15] judge let me not become an evangelist
[2:09:17] now
[2:09:19] the union between a man and a woman is a
[2:09:21] great
[2:09:29] mystery in of
[2:09:32] God be one with
[2:09:37] us the basis of his intention for the
[2:09:39] human race is
[2:09:47] love say
[2:09:50] love Andre
[2:09:55] say his way of saying love is the
[2:09:59] [Music]
[2:10:01] best praise the name of the Lord John
[2:10:04] 3:16 for God so loved the
[2:10:09] world that he gave his only begotten
[2:10:12] son his his basis of intention has been
[2:10:17] love
[2:10:20] he proved this love with the ultimate
[2:10:28] price his
[2:10:31] life like Christ two
[2:10:37] adults don't miss this brother Andrew
[2:10:42] two can only have a successful marriage
[2:10:45] sister
[2:10:47] phbe
[2:10:50] if true
[2:10:53] love is the basis of that
[2:10:57] marriage Peter
[2:11:00] thought and I'm heading to the climax
[2:11:02] now Peter
[2:11:05] thought he had love for
[2:11:08] Jesus but in a
[2:11:10] moment that love
[2:11:13] disappear you all remember when Peter
[2:11:16] said when all the others
[2:11:18] you I will not forsake you I will be
[2:11:22] with you I'll go with you all the
[2:11:24] way and then a little girl
[2:11:27] came and said I saw you with this
[2:11:32] man said what you talking
[2:11:35] about me I don't know the
[2:11:39] man not
[2:11:41] me I've never seen the
[2:11:45] man this is the same man Peter
[2:11:48] who had said Jesus I love you I will be
[2:11:52] with
[2:11:55] you
[2:11:59] Victor this is what boys this is what
[2:12:01] boys tells tell
[2:12:03] girls what kind of love is that that is
[2:12:07] not true
[2:12:08] love that is human
[2:12:13] love what Peter had for
[2:12:17] Jesus it is genuine humanly speaking is
[2:12:22] genuine but when he was
[2:12:25] tested that love could not
[2:12:28] stand and listen our marriage as
[2:12:33] Believers is not on the basis of that
[2:12:36] kind of
[2:12:38] love because that kind of love will
[2:12:42] fail but wait when Peter received the
[2:12:46] Holy
[2:12:47] Spirit on the
[2:12:50] Pentecost people came and they found
[2:12:53] Peter and the rest of the
[2:12:55] others even Mary the mother of
[2:12:58] Jesus they were speaking in
[2:13:01] [Music]
[2:13:06] Tong what what are you
[2:13:08] doing you're speaking in Tong and they
[2:13:12] looked at them and
[2:13:14] said they are drunk in the
[2:13:16] morning here is a man who was fearful in
[2:13:20] the
[2:13:21] beginning Peter who thought he loved
[2:13:25] Jesus in the
[2:13:26] beginning but
[2:13:28] now now when he was faced with
[2:13:34] opposition before more than 3,000
[2:13:39] people before them now he was filled the
[2:13:44] power of the Holy
[2:13:45] Spirit he looked at them and said
[2:13:48] say in the book of Acts chapter
[2:13:51] 2 Men and
[2:13:53] brethren we are not drunk with
[2:13:57] wine but we are drunk with the
[2:14:01] spirit he said we are drunk with the
[2:14:05] spirit is that which was spoken by
[2:14:08] Prophet
[2:14:09] Jo that power out my
[2:14:12] spirit upon All
[2:14:14] Flesh son and your daughters shall
[2:14:16] prophesy
[2:14:19] as Peter was speaking he was speaking
[2:14:22] boldly he was charged
[2:14:25] up jumping up and
[2:14:27] down shouting on top of his voice
[2:14:32] excited like any drun you
[2:14:35] know but this time not with what
[2:14:39] Al
[2:14:40] [Music]
[2:14:42] not but he was drunk with the
[2:14:46] spirit Hallelujah amen now
[2:14:51] Peter the other people told
[2:14:55] him men
[2:14:57] andren what shall we do and Peter drunk
[2:15:01] by the
[2:15:02] spirit he spoke to each and every one
[2:15:05] of check it in your
[2:15:07] Bible
[2:15:10] 2: he said
[2:15:12] repent every one of you and be baptized
[2:15:17] in the name name of the Lord Jesus
[2:15:19] Christ for the remission of your
[2:15:22] sins and shall receive the Holy
[2:15:27] Spirit why he gave them a
[2:15:31] formula of receiving the Holy
[2:15:34] Spirit now why am I talking about
[2:15:36] that Peter before he received the Holy
[2:15:41] Spirit he thought he had
[2:15:44] love but that love was human love
[2:15:48] and it failed it failed
[2:15:51] him can you
[2:15:55] imagine I will love you until until
[2:16:00] until but all those things
[2:16:02] fail don't they say those things and
[2:16:05] they
[2:16:06] fail but
[2:16:09] wait when Peter the Holy Spirit had come
[2:16:12] upon
[2:16:13] him when
[2:16:16] he
[2:16:18] he didn't
[2:16:20] fail he F in
[2:16:22] his that great
[2:16:24] love and said because I love Jesus with
[2:16:28] all my
[2:16:30] heart I'll not I'll not let him
[2:16:34] down let me stand before these people
[2:16:38] and speak about Jesus and he spoke about
[2:16:41] Jesus where did he get the
[2:16:44] B from the right kind of love
[2:16:49] the right kind of love my brother Andrew
[2:16:53] sister comes from the Holy
[2:16:56] Spirit if you don't have the Holy
[2:17:00] Spirit canot have the right perfect kind
[2:17:03] of
[2:17:04] love those who believe it can say
[2:17:09] Amen so what does that
[2:17:15] mean there is no constancy in it
[2:17:18] [Music]
[2:17:21] from the day Peter received the Holy
[2:17:24] Spirit never denied Jesus
[2:17:27] Christ he demonstrated his love for him
[2:17:30] all
[2:17:31] [Music]
[2:17:33] through he has received the Holy
[2:17:36] Spirit which is the true basis of
[2:17:41] love this is the true foundation
[2:17:46] sister upon
[2:17:49] which any
[2:17:53] relationship any strong marriage
[2:17:56] Union can be
[2:17:59] built that is the
[2:18:01] B and how do you receive the Holy
[2:18:05] Spirit one
[2:18:07] thing you repent and I'm sure I was
[2:18:11] there when you were repenting brother
[2:18:14] Andre you told me you
[2:18:16] repented what is repentance forsaking
[2:18:19] all
[2:18:21] else forsaking the world the pride of
[2:18:26] life forsaking
[2:18:29] the the lust of the
[2:18:32] eyes forsaking the lust of the
[2:18:35] flesh that's
[2:18:37] repentance from
