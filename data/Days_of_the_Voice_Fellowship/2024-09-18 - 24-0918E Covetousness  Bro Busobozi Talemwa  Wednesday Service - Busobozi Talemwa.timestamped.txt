[40:20] helper I will not fear what man shall do
[40:22] unto
[40:25] me amen amen you may be
[40:28] seated so this evening I want to speak

[40:50] service and and um because I feel that
[40:54] this will change many things in our
[40:56] lives
[41:00] um I'm going to speak to you on an
[41:02] unusual subject I don't usually give
[41:04] such
[41:07] subjects just one
[41:10] word
[41:13] cous praise the
[41:20] Lord
[41:22] cous and pray for my interpreters so
[41:24] that we may be in the same spirit
[41:29] amen uh if I find it is is getting hard
[41:34] time I will tell him to sit and then I
[41:36] just preach with that in an interpreter
[41:38] so this evening I am just speaking on
[41:42] covetousness
[41:43] cous tell your neighbor
[41:49] cous we have a lot of problems in
[41:53] life and um we have a lot of Mur that
[41:57] happens every
[42:00] day for example in our country we've
[42:03] suffered what we call
[42:08] corruption and um you know people who
[42:11] are not
[42:13] faithful and we have things we suffer
[42:18] theft many homes have
[42:22] gats brother sh it was perfect in the
[42:24] beginning and then he made it worse so
[42:26] uh you know know uh we have many people
[42:28] who have
[42:30] Gs and um you know they the reason why
[42:35] people have Gs is because they're
[42:36] fearing
[42:40] thieves we at my home we did not we had
[42:43] we had a a perimeter wall
[42:47] fence but we did not have the bued wires
[42:50] on
[42:52] top and then someone and then some
[42:54] thieves broke in
[42:58] and vandalized our
[43:00] car so you see we we had to find someone
[43:04] to put those
[43:07] B and you know people put electricity on
[43:11] top so that when someone tries to go
[43:14] over it electricity just shock
[43:19] them students at school they have their
[43:22] boxes where they keep their things and
[43:23] they put a padlock on it
[43:29] because of
[43:31] theft someone else will come and steal
[43:34] it money when you have money you never
[43:38] want to count it before
[43:40] everyone because of many reasons maybe
[43:44] someone may want to steal it from
[43:46] you maybe someone will desire to come
[43:49] and you know borrow some from
[43:53] you and maybe someone may just come and
[43:56] tell you to give them
[43:58] some so no one among all of you among
[44:02] all of us counts money in the
[44:06] open you always count it
[44:09] secretly because you fear what someone
[44:12] else will do with your
[44:15] money and you know we we have many
[44:18] people that um uh go into um you know uh
[44:23] things like fornication
[44:27] and and things like
[44:29] adultery we have people who you know
[44:33] have
[44:34] en
[44:37] envy and and um things like
[44:40] last
[44:42] greed now these things that I just spoke
[44:45] about and many many
[44:47] others I asked one young man
[44:50] today a question which I think is very
[44:54] important which we should ask ourselves
[44:58] the question is why do people
[45:02] steal so well he said people steal
[45:04] because they don't
[45:06] have but I said no I don't believe
[45:10] that why why would someone steal because
[45:13] they don't
[45:14] have you know because to begin
[45:18] with maybe I don't have but have not
[45:22] gone out to steal maybe you don't have
[45:25] you've not gone out to steal
[45:27] but why does someone else who doesn't
[45:29] have like you feels they should
[45:34] Ste it
[45:37] is someone who doesn't have like
[45:44] you you see because for them you know
[45:47] they they have something else disturbing
[45:51] them it is not because of
[45:53] lack we don't steal because of lack
[45:57] but people still because of one
[46:00] thing and that is called
[46:04] cous
[46:06] cous now cous is a spirit that has
[46:08] killed many
[46:12] Believers while they are in the
[46:15] church many of them are dead spiritually
[46:19] dead yet they are
[46:21] believers you see this Spirit seeks to
[46:25] undermine it seeks to undermine the
[46:27] Providence of of Jehovah
[46:34] God you know it has you know it has you
[46:37] know it is responsible for broken
[46:42] homes the spirit of
[46:44] covetousness is responsible for for the
[46:47] lives of younger people that are not
[46:49] serving
[46:52] God you know their life is broken up in
[46:55] pieces
[46:57] they're not serving God because of the
[47:00] spirit of
[47:02] cous you know covetousness has separated
[47:07] Brotherhood you find that someone
[47:09] doesn't feel good about the
[47:12] other it is not for any reason is
[47:16] because of the spirit of
[47:19] cous now cous does not operate
[47:24] alone it has many cousins and many
[47:26] brothers
[47:29] and and those are the ones which I have
[47:31] already
[47:35] mentioned
[47:39] lastor
[47:43] Bor people that we know the Bible calls
[47:46] them
[47:48] extortioners you know
[47:51] cormen
[47:53] MERS how can someone just kill
[47:59] you find someone you know we've seen it
[48:01] here
[48:02] in someone on
[48:04] a and someone else comes and hits them
[48:09] and takes away what they
[48:10] have she doesn't even know what is
[48:14] inside but you see he feels what the
[48:17] other person has should be
[48:21] there it is a bad bad Spirit you even
[48:25] find actually it is a it is prevalent
[48:28] among
[48:31] Believers it is so much sin
[48:35] prevalent you know you find that you
[48:37] know sometimes even you know it comes to
[48:40] things as simple as what somebody else
[48:45] owns you know someone can literally H
[48:48] you because of the good thing you
[48:51] have not because you know you did
[48:54] anything
[48:55] but simp because you have something they
[48:58] don't
[49:00] have and then they will get envy and
[49:03] then they will become
[49:05] jealous but jealous is not the
[49:07] problem the problem is
[49:10] cious you know jealous just simply came
[49:13] because of
[49:15] cous you know someone you know you you
[49:17] have maybe a good suit
[49:21] dress some people would even go an extra
[49:25] mile of saying please can you borrow it
[49:28] to me so I can use it one
[49:34] time you know such people they will even
[49:36] take it and they will never want to give
[49:38] it back again to
[49:43] you you see Brethren you should say Amen
[49:46] on this thing because it is many people
[49:48] suffering
[49:51] because I seen it with my Naked
[49:54] Eyes believe suffering because
[49:59] someone come says borrow me your
[50:01] cloth and they will never return it to
[50:04] you because they being tormented with
[50:06] the spirit
[50:09] of they never desire to borrow
[50:14] it their desire was not to borrow but to
[50:17] have
[50:23] it and so he says please can I use your
[50:26] shoes
[50:28] and then he will take it just for one
[50:30] service another service another service
[50:33] and he always see him at
[50:35] church God bless you bless you he never
[50:39] talks about the
[50:42] shoes and until the shoes even you know
[50:45] become
[50:47] old and he does and he doesn't mention
[50:51] about and you say any he's a brother he
[50:53] a sister it's all right I'll not talk
[50:56] about
[50:57] it's a spirit of
[51:00] cous you know it is because people are
[51:02] not
[51:04] contented with what they have they feel
[51:08] what someone else
[51:11] has even
[51:12] houses you find someone who is living in
[51:15] a good
[51:16] house living in a neighborhood that has
[51:19] very poor
[51:22] houses and all those people will hurt
[51:25] him
[51:27] because they would say that man is
[51:29] proud that man is bad simply because he
[51:33] owns a good
[51:34] house not because he did anything bad
[51:38] to people are
[51:41] cous what the person
[51:43] has because someone is driving a car and
[51:47] you you are walking and then when they
[51:49] pass you and other times when you are in
[51:52] a car you won't see people walking
[51:58] and then when you pass a
[52:00] brother can you
[52:02] imagine that brother is so
[52:04] proud he just passed me like that he
[52:08] couldn't even wave to me but they just
[52:11] that's not the
[52:13] issue deep in their heart they know you
[52:15] might don't have SE
[52:18] them but because they
[52:21] cious they feel it shouldn't be you
[52:24] driving it should be them driving that
[52:30] you see you know when some when you
[52:32] receive
[52:33] something others f it should be
[52:37] their they will even change their
[52:38] prayers they will go before
[52:41] God you have given the other
[52:43] one the other what about me and the
[52:47] Bible says you pray and you don't
[52:48] receive things you pray
[52:51] for because you pray a Miss God can't
[52:54] answer such a prayer
[52:57] because it is coming out of a heart of
[53:00] cous a cous
[53:03] heart you feel you don't even have
[53:06] Vision you don't know where your life is
[53:08] going but you you keep comparing your
[53:11] life with
[53:14] others you are not contented with what
[53:16] God has given you and what God has made
[53:20] you but you feel what God has made
[53:23] others should be you
[53:27] when someone marri sister
[53:32] phbe where when someone marri sister
[53:34] phib you feel no no no no no no oh we
[53:38] have a phib in the church sister Sandra
[53:41] or whoever it
[53:44] is you know you find oh no that
[53:47] sister should have been
[53:49] mine I could feel it in my heart even we
[53:53] were
[53:54] matching even the way I was you see it
[53:57] is
[53:59] cous it is nothing else it is
[54:02] cous this is what makes people in the
[54:04] world be
[54:06] others this is what makes others
[54:09] actually when people are
[54:11] traveling you know many times they don't
[54:13] tell others they're
[54:15] traveling especially here in Africa when
[54:17] someone is flying they don't tell
[54:22] others do you know why because of cous
[54:27] they fear what the other person will do
[54:28] to
[54:29] them some people are very good at going
[54:32] around and trying to frustrate people's
[54:41] lives the moment they hear that
[54:43] something is happening in someone's
[54:47] life they begin getting a
[54:50] headache how can I frustrate it how can
[54:53] I stop it how can I make make it not
[54:57] happen you know why do they do that it
[55:01] is because of
[55:03] cous I'm telling you covetousness in
[55:06] English
[55:08] means a strong wish to have
[55:16] something especially something that
[55:18] belongs to someone else
[55:27] to have something a strong wish to have
[55:34] something to have something especially
[55:37] that thing which belongs to someone
[55:41] else is not yours it is somebody
[55:44] else's but you feel you
[55:48] wish
[55:51] strongly it was
[55:53] yours that whenever I put on this
[55:57] suit you feel a strong
[56:01] wish to have it as
[56:04] yours some of you would even go an extra
[56:08] mile coming to ask that
[56:10] person how much do you buy this
[56:15] suit how much do you
[56:17] buy and then the person will tell you I
[56:21] bought it
[56:22] 500,000 you say I wish the Lord gives me
[56:25] that money
[56:28] oh my brother this is a very good but
[56:31] what are you looking for you want the
[56:33] person to say can I give it to
[56:37] you it is a spirit of
[56:41] conciousness by the way it's a very
[56:43] dangerous
[56:44] Spirit it has broken
[56:47] homes it has broken
[56:50] relationships even
[56:52] churches and
[56:55] Ministries today I want us to learn
[56:57] about
[56:59] it and first of all I want us to go into
[57:02] the book of
[57:04] Kings excuse me those of you with
[57:07] luganda Bibles I'm going to request you
[57:08] to read slowly with me because is very
[57:11] many verses and to save time we will
[57:13] just read in English and follow in your
[57:15] luganda Bible First Kings chapter 21:
[57:20] 1 and brother you can just follow as
[57:23] well in Yanda Bible so that you can be
[57:25] in the same Spirit afterwards to know
[57:26] how to interpret some words okay look at
[57:28] verse one we will begin from verse one
[57:30] and it came to pass after these things
[57:32] that nabo the Israelite had a vineard
[57:36] which was in jezrael had by the Palace
[57:39] of Ahab king of Samaria and haab spake
[57:44] unto nabo saying give me your vineard
[57:47] that I may have it for a garden of hubs
[57:50] because it is near unto my house and I
[57:52] will give thee for it a better Vineyard
[57:55] than it or if it seem Good To Thee I
[57:58] will give Thee the worth of it in money
[58:01] and nabo said to Ahab the Lord forbid it
[58:05] me that I should give the inheritance of
[58:08] my fathers unto thee and Ahab came into
[58:12] his house heavy and displeased because
[58:14] of the word which nabo the jite had
[58:17] spoken to him for he had said I will not
[58:19] give Thee the inheritance of my fathers
[58:22] and he laid him down upon his bed and
[58:25] turned away his face and would not eat
[58:28] bread I want you to hear these
[58:31] things this is a man a king think about
[58:35] it a
[58:36] king a man who had the whole
[58:40] Kingdom a man who people PID taxes
[58:44] to a man who almost had everything he
[58:47] desired to
[58:48] have who ate what he
[58:50] needed who had a big house who had huge
[58:54] lands who had a lot of
[58:58] money but there was another poor
[59:01] man and this man had a a field
[59:05] a which was closed to this man's
[59:10] house so King Ahab came and told
[59:13] him
[59:15] please he sat you know down with him in
[59:20] peace it doesn't matter whether you want
[59:22] to take that thing in peace
[59:27] if it is not
[59:28] yours you are not
[59:31] contented that's the reason why you are
[59:33] looking or eyeing something which
[59:34] doesn't belong to
[59:37] you God loves you and whatever he wants
[59:41] to give you he will give
[59:44] you God made only you you you
[59:48] world there is no one
[59:50] like whatever is yours is yours no else
[59:53] can
[59:56] can take your
[59:58] place if each of us can understand that
[1:00:01] we are going to grow Spirit to know that
[1:00:04] no man can take my
[1:00:06] place I am
[1:00:08] special I am wonderfully
[1:00:12] made
[1:00:14] powerfully in the hands of God whatever
[1:00:18] I
[1:00:18] need father knows what I
[1:00:21] need he is able to
[1:00:24] provide and what he has done for
[1:00:27] others he can do for
[1:00:29] me amen it's a
[1:00:32] revelation it's an understanding so it
[1:00:35] is wrong for you to think cous is only
[1:00:38] with poor
[1:00:41] people oh it's because they don't have
[1:00:45] that's why they cous here is an example
[1:00:48] for
[1:00:48] you man who was
[1:00:51] rich I mean we're talking about a
[1:00:54] king but here
[1:00:56] this King had a lot of
[1:00:59] wealth but when he saw a certain
[1:01:02] beautiful piece of
[1:01:05] land that a poor man had inherited from
[1:01:09] his
[1:01:12] father you know he felt even this should
[1:01:15] be
[1:01:16] mine I should Annex it to my
[1:01:20] land and he oh my God he began seeing a
[1:01:25] vision
[1:01:27] amen with something which is not
[1:01:30] his when you see someone's
[1:01:33] money you begin to see what it will buy
[1:01:36] you if I can only get what that one
[1:01:39] has I I can do this and this and that if
[1:01:43] I can only get that
[1:01:45] c I can use it for this and
[1:01:48] that if I can have those
[1:01:51] shoes if I can have that suit or that
[1:01:56] the way I will serve god with it you are
[1:01:59] seeing a vision with someone else's
[1:02:03] blessings and that is wrong you should
[1:02:06] see a
[1:02:07] vision with the blessing God promised
[1:02:10] you in the
[1:02:12] word hallelujah whatever is mine is
[1:02:16] mine and I see a vision of my
[1:02:19] life with what God has blessed me
[1:02:23] with if people saw this
[1:02:27] people had a revelation of
[1:02:29] this we would have few
[1:02:33] Beggars have few
[1:02:36] thieves people can't see
[1:02:38] it and here you see
[1:02:41] NAB he knew this is
[1:02:44] mine this is my
[1:02:46] inheritance from my
[1:02:48] fathers and when this King came to him
[1:02:52] he said
[1:02:53] now I have a proposition
[1:02:56] please give me this land you know I am
[1:03:00] rich I will give you even another
[1:03:03] land I even give you
[1:03:06] money whatever it is you
[1:03:08] want simply give me your small land
[1:03:11] here so I can make it
[1:03:14] mine but in his mind he was seeing
[1:03:18] vegetables
[1:03:22] there vegetables
[1:03:27] and the way he was envisioning
[1:03:29] it it look so nice near his
[1:03:35] house he knew his
[1:03:37] bless he knew his
[1:03:40] Blessing he said I will not give it

[1:05:21] man he was he felt so down
[1:05:28] he became so
[1:05:29] sick and this man Ahab went in his
[1:05:33] bed and he turned away his
[1:05:36] face and he will not even
[1:05:39] eat how many times have you gone to
[1:05:41] fasting and prayer because you want
[1:05:43] something else that belongs to somebody
[1:05:50] else may God have
[1:05:52] mercy let me continue reading verse 5
[1:05:56] but Jezebel his wife came to him and
[1:05:59] said unto him why is your spirit so
[1:06:02] sad that thou eatest not bread and he
[1:06:05] said unto her because I spake unto na of
[1:06:07] the Israelite and said unto him give me
[1:06:10] thy vineard for money or else if it
[1:06:12] pleases Thee I will give thee another
[1:06:14] Vineyard for it and he answered I will
[1:06:16] not give thee my Vineyard and Jezebel
[1:06:18] his wife said unto him D thou now govern
[1:06:21] the Kingdom of Israel arise and eat
[1:06:23] bread and let thine heart be Mary I will
[1:06:27] give Thee the vineard of nabo theelite
[1:06:31] so she wrote letters in H's name and
[1:06:33] sealed them with with his seal and sent
[1:06:36] the letters unto the elders and to the
[1:06:38] Nobles that were in his City dwelling
[1:06:40] with nabo praise the name of the Lord
[1:06:42] amen hallelujah amen friends I want you
[1:06:45] to follow me closely here you see this
[1:06:48] man you know was a
[1:06:50] king he couldn't get this
[1:06:53] land he wanted to get it
[1:06:56] peacefully but he failed he wanted to
[1:06:59] get it in the right way
[1:07:01] right but he failed and therefore what
[1:07:04] did he decide to
[1:07:06] do his wife met
[1:07:08] him said why are you like
[1:07:11] this come on be
[1:07:14] happy I will give you
[1:07:17] this and how many times have we seen
[1:07:19] such
[1:07:22] shortcuts let me tell you to begin with
[1:07:25] it was not the will of God for this man
[1:07:27] to have
[1:07:30] this and so he was already fighting
[1:07:33] against
[1:07:34] God secondly he has now gone to a
[1:07:40] shortcut to acquire what he
[1:07:43] wants there is no shortcut with
[1:07:47] God and your blessing if it is oh
[1:07:50] Hallelujah if it is a blessing from God
[1:07:55] it will never have any
[1:07:59] shortcut the blessing of God is a
[1:08:02] blessing of
[1:08:03] God the Bible says the blessing of God
[1:08:06] make a few
[1:08:08] rich and God adds no
[1:08:12] sorrow the blessings he
[1:08:15] gives here is a woman saying I will give
[1:08:20] you don't worry I will give you what you
[1:08:23] want I give you what
[1:08:26] no man no woman can give you what you
[1:08:29] want if you want joy no
[1:08:33] one if you want happiness
[1:08:36] no if you want peace no
[1:08:39] wonder only God will give it to
[1:08:43] you whatever you desire in your
[1:08:46] life let it be money let it be houses
[1:08:51] Let It Be buildings rather listen
[1:08:53] businesses
[1:08:55] or a wife or woman a man or whatever it
[1:08:59] is or
[1:09:00] children no one can give it to you only
[1:09:05] God Only
[1:09:07] God Only God can give us the blessings
[1:09:11] of today I'm sharing a very important
[1:09:17] principle hallelujah amen praise the
[1:09:20] name of the Lord amen as I was studying
[1:09:22] these things
[1:09:23] today from the beginning to the
[1:09:26] end my heart was just bubbling
[1:09:30] in from beginning to the end and as I
[1:09:34] was writing these
[1:09:35] things you know I I believe God wants to
[1:09:38] you know speak to someone today with
[1:09:40] these
[1:09:41] words so listen and we continue with
[1:09:45] this
[1:09:45] reading and so she wrote the letter
[1:09:48] saying proclaim a fast and set NAB on
[1:09:51] high among the people and set two men
[1:09:53] sons of Bia before him to Bear witness
[1:09:57] against him saying thou did blashe God
[1:10:00] and the king and then carry him out and
[1:10:02] stone him that he may die and the men of
[1:10:05] his City even the elders and the Nobles
[1:10:07] who were the the inhabitants in his city
[1:10:09] did as Jezebel had sent unto them and as
[1:10:12] it was written in the letters which he
[1:10:14] had sent unto them they proclaimed a
[1:10:17] fast and set nabo on high among the
[1:10:19] people and there came in two men
[1:10:22] children of beral beral and and sat
[1:10:26] before him and the men of Bia witnessed
[1:10:29] saying NAB both did blashe God and the
[1:10:32] King Then They Carried him forth out of
[1:10:35] the city and stoned him with the stones
[1:10:38] that he died then they sent to Jezebel
[1:10:41] saying nabo is stoned and is dead and it
[1:10:44] came to pass when Jezebel heard that
[1:10:46] nabo was stoned and was dead that
[1:10:48] Jezebel said to Ahab arise take
[1:10:50] possession of thy Vineyard of the
[1:10:52] vineyard of nabo the jite which he
[1:10:55] refused to give thee for money for nabo
[1:10:57] is not alive but dead and it came to
[1:11:00] pass when Ahab heard that naboth was
[1:11:03] dead that Ahab rose up to go down to the
[1:11:06] vineard of nabo the jite to take
[1:11:09] possession of it now you see friends
[1:11:12] You' heard the
[1:11:13] story now when they killed him he
[1:11:17] thought he can now
[1:11:20] possess let me now tell you s whatever
[1:11:24] is yours
[1:11:26] that God purposed for you the devil
[1:11:28] cannot take
[1:11:30] it no one don't even
[1:11:33] compete I see people with doing
[1:11:36] competition people compete everywhere
[1:11:39] they compete in business they comp at
[1:11:42] place of

[1:12:08] here is a
[1:12:09] man his wife
[1:12:11] Jezebel and by the way that also warns
[1:12:15] us why we should Mar
[1:12:18] Believers if you marry an
[1:12:20] unbeliever you will increase your
[1:12:22] ungodliness
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:28] amen yes but if you marry a
[1:12:31] Believer amen a woman that fears go will
[1:12:35] always bring amen this man to the
[1:12:37] understanding of the
[1:12:41] word check your Bible properly you will
[1:12:44] see that it has always women who have
[1:12:46] been subm
[1:12:49] minded it was the wife of Pontius
[1:12:53] pilot I think it was who came and told
[1:12:56] him I saw in the
[1:12:59] night that this man is
[1:13:02] innocent don't kill
[1:13:04] him God spoke through that
[1:13:07] woman it has always been women who are
[1:13:09] so
[1:13:13] minded you know it was the wife of of
[1:13:16] the mother of the of the
[1:13:20] Mano who came down and said to him the
[1:13:24] angel came and spoke
[1:13:26] to I met him you know and yet this man
[1:13:30] had not even seen the
[1:13:32] angel are you following me it was it was
[1:13:35] this same woman who trained
[1:13:39] Samson about the word of
[1:13:42] God about the vision for his ministry
[1:13:45] and
[1:13:46] his it was
[1:13:48] Elizabeth that even had a vision for the
[1:13:51] name of
[1:13:53] John it was Mary
[1:13:56] amen who God used in this world to bring
[1:13:59] forth a life that redeemed this entire
[1:14:02] world it has always been woman women
[1:14:05] women
[1:14:07] women that God uses in a
[1:14:10] family that is why it is not a man that
[1:14:13] breaks a
[1:14:15] family it is a woman who breaks a family
[1:14:19] and that is why it is not a woman that
[1:14:22] breaks H builds a family not a man that
[1:14:26] build did you know that chur it is the
[1:14:30] woman that builds
[1:14:32] the the Bible says the foolish
[1:14:35] one with own
[1:14:37] hands but the wise
[1:14:39] one
[1:14:41] with so you see a woman is a very
[1:14:44] important
[1:14:47] thing in every important
[1:14:52] home you see in the beginning it was a
[1:14:56] woman you know that brought
[1:15:01] deception and and and she said oh God
[1:15:03] has given me a
[1:15:05] child that's why they said it's women
[1:15:07] who give children not
[1:15:10] men why because the woman knows what
[1:15:14] happened in the
[1:15:17] garden she knows when the seed was
[1:15:21] planted know what kind of seed is
[1:15:24] planted
[1:15:26] because she knows she Waters the seed
[1:15:31] properly and in America today in America
[1:15:34] today you have the
[1:15:37] Democrats who will say that it's okay
[1:15:40] for woman to pull out a
[1:15:47] child it is it is her decision what she
[1:15:49] does with
[1:15:52] her but as the woman of America
[1:15:55] that but that's the woman of America but
[1:15:58] there is another
[1:15:59] woman amen there is a woman of God there
[1:16:04] is a woman of
[1:16:05] virtue a woman of the
[1:16:08] word who only obeys the word of

[1:16:16] backbone of
[1:16:18] Family

[1:16:28] is look at the women in the
[1:16:31] church how they dress how they behave

[1:16:46] know if you want to know the
[1:16:49] man don't look at him look at his wife
[1:16:54] know that man is
[1:16:59] spiritual so we can now

[1:17:07] man because he had a
[1:17:09] woman that brought more
[1:17:13] Mischief the man was was

[1:40:12] Samuel if you can turn

[1:40:18] 11 ver
[1:40:20] 2 and it came to pass in un evening tide
[1:40:24] that David arose from off his bed and
[1:40:27] walked upon the roof of the King's
[1:40:29] house and from the roof of the from the
[1:40:33] roof he saw a woman washing herself and
[1:40:35] the woman was very beautiful to look
[1:40:38] upon and David sent and inquired after
[1:40:41] the woman and one said is not this BBA
[1:40:44] the daughter of Aram the wife of UA the
[1:40:46] hittite and David sent Messengers and
[1:40:48] took her and she came in unto him and
[1:40:50] they lay with her for she was purified
[1:40:53] from her uncleanness and she returned
[1:40:55] unto her house now I want to see
[1:40:58] friends what cous can
[1:41:02] do is a
[1:41:06] sickness if you're not
[1:41:08] careful it doesn't matter who you
[1:41:11] are you can actually have
[1:41:14] cous and you don't
[1:41:17] know and you think no it's all
[1:41:20] right you see David was a king he was a
[1:41:24] man after God his own
[1:41:25] hand and
[1:41:28] David was on top of the roof of his
[1:41:38] house you know she didn't close her
[1:41:41] curtain sister always close your
[1:41:45] curtain dress properly stay away from
[1:41:50] being a
[1:41:52] problem you are the one presenting
[1:41:54] yourself that
[1:41:55] way so she presented that
[1:41:58] way and when the man saw
[1:42:01] her he converted her she was not his
[1:42:07] wife she was the wife of
[1:42:09] another but this maned her he desired
[1:42:13] her and he told the boys go get
[1:42:17] her and the Bible says she lay with her
[1:42:19] he lay with
[1:42:21] her and afterward she was pried and then
[1:42:24] she was sent back to her
[1:42:26] house and a woman conceived and sent and
[1:42:30] told David and said I am with
[1:42:36] child and David sent to Jo saying
[1:42:46] me I want you to see cious will bring
[1:42:49] many
[1:42:51] sins cious
[1:42:55] adultery and now other sins are going to
[1:42:59] come and so David said to Ura go down to
[1:43:03] the house and wash your feet and U
[1:43:06] departed out of the King's house and
[1:43:08] there followed him a mess of meat from
[1:43:10] the
[1:43:14] King and so and then they also sent a
[1:43:18] mess of meat
[1:43:24] let me just read in English but Ur slept
[1:43:27] at the door of the King's house with all
[1:43:29] the Servants of his Lord and went not
[1:43:32] down to his house and when they had told
[1:43:34] David saying UA went not down unto his
[1:43:37] house David said unto UA CEST thou not
[1:43:40] from thy Journey why then did this not
[1:43:42] go down unto thy house and Ura said unto
[1:43:45] David the ark and Israel and Judah abide
[1:43:48] in tents and my Lord joab and the
[1:43:50] Servants of my Lord are encamped in the
[1:43:53] Open Fields shall I then go into my
[1:43:55] house to eat and to drink and to lie
[1:43:57] with my wife as thou livest and as thy
[1:43:59] soul leaveth I will not do this thing
[1:44:01] and David said unto Ura T here today
[1:44:04] also and tomorrow I will let thee depart
[1:44:07] so Ura in Jerusalem that day and and
[1:44:09] the tomorrow and when David had called
[1:44:11] him he did eat and drink before him and
[1:44:14] he made him drank and at evening he went
[1:44:18] out to lie on his bed with the Servants
[1:44:20] of his Lord but went not down to his own
[1:44:23] house and it came to pass in the morning
[1:44:25] that David wrote a letter to joab and
[1:44:27] sent it by the hand of Ura and he wrote
[1:44:29] it in the letter saying set you rear in
[1:44:32] the Forefront of the hottest battle and
[1:44:35] retire you from him leave him there that
[1:44:38] he may be smen and die and it came to
[1:44:41] pass when joab observed the city that he
[1:44:43] assigned Ura unto a place where he knew
[1:44:47] that Valiant men were and the men of the
[1:44:50] city went out and fought with joab and
[1:44:52] they F some of the people of the
[1:44:54] Servants of David and the he died also

[1:47:23] a few things here before I
[1:47:26] conclude listen tasting for
[1:47:30] Life brother bam says now

[1:47:39] life the devil inspiring
[1:47:42] it do you know it's the devil who
[1:47:44] inspires perverted
[1:47:49] life that life becomes miserable
[1:47:55] I've oh my good Lord he says I've never
[1:47:58] seen it in all stages from the rich to
[1:48:05] the get into the spirit of this and
[1:48:07] listen to this he says I've had the
[1:48:09] privilege of being in King's
[1:48:13] palaces from that to the
[1:48:17] lowest on the SK
[1:48:21] Ro and I've never seen a contented
[1:48:25] sinner in my
[1:48:30] life from the
[1:48:35] richest to the
[1:48:37] poorest our Prophet says I've never seen
[1:48:40] a contented sinner in my
[1:48:44] [Applause]
[1:48:45] life that's right there is no
[1:48:49] happiness or contentment
[1:48:54] outside of Jesus
[1:48:56] Christ I've seen them so
[1:49:00] rich till they have bodys with
[1:49:05] them and I've also seen them so
[1:49:10] poor Till They begged for a drink of
[1:49:15] whiskey and from the one to the
[1:49:21] other he say say there is no
[1:49:28] satisfaction I want everyone here or
[1:49:30] anyone
[1:49:32] here who has ever saw
[1:49:35] sinned and said I sinned and I became
[1:49:45] satisfi but he says then what do they
[1:49:48] call that
[1:49:49] life how could you call it life
[1:49:54] when you want to take it when you want
[1:49:56] to take
[1:49:57] yourself it's not
[1:49:59] life and in the influence of another he
[1:50:01] says it takes the power of the
[1:50:03] resurrection of Christ among the
[1:50:08] people amongst the
[1:50:11] people that they see that Christ is not
[1:50:13] a statue hanging in a
[1:50:19] building but is's a living being in the
[1:50:21] form of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:25] living in
[1:50:26] men and
[1:50:28] women Glory bringing
[1:50:32] peace bringing
[1:50:35] contentment and bringing
[1:50:37] happiness hallelujah amen Jesus Christ
[1:50:41] the Holy
[1:50:42] Ghost is the power in
[1:50:44] us that brings us
[1:50:47] peace that brings us
[1:50:50] satisfaction that brings us am and
[1:50:55] contentment it brings us
[1:50:58] happiness that's why we sing song like
[1:51:00] I've been happy since the Lord brought
[1:51:02] me
[1:51:04] out you know if you want to see someone
[1:51:08] who is
[1:51:10] delivered if you want to see someone
[1:51:12] filled with the Holy
[1:51:14] Ghost someone who is always
[1:51:18] happy always
[1:51:20] happy in the bedroom happen
[1:51:23] at
[1:51:24] home on the
[1:51:26] road in the church
[1:51:29] Happ when someone is
[1:51:32] s it is clear they don't have the Holy
[1:51:36] Ghost you can never have the Holy Ghost
[1:51:39] and be
[1:51:43] sad but if you have the Holy Ghost even
[1:51:47] if you have no money even if you have no
[1:51:51] CR even if you no cars even if you have
[1:51:54] no house even if you have no
[1:51:58] church you will be
[1:52:01] happy the Holy Ghost brings
[1:52:04] happiness that's why we sing
[1:52:07] songs Jo is mine Jo is mine can you look
[1:52:12] at me with happiness
[1:52:14] now Jo
[1:52:17] today that's why when a preacher
[1:52:21] preaches by the of the holy ghost He
[1:52:24] will always be happy have you wondered
[1:52:27] why because the Holy
[1:52:30] Ghost put an effect of of
[1:52:36] drunkenness you can never see a drunken
[1:52:43] s if you are
[1:52:45] drun all of them are
[1:52:48] happy the moment they begin
[1:52:50] drinking drinking
[1:52:53] several
[1:52:54] bottles when they were
[1:52:59] s then happen will
[1:53:10] begin what is happening with him he's
[1:53:15] drunk he dry they know them those ones
[1:53:19] who are not
[1:53:20] drunk will be sober and
[1:53:24] there and this one will not care whether
[1:53:27] it's falling on people or
[1:53:29] not
[1:53:38] just he's happy because he
[1:53:44] drunk don't I'm drunk right
[1:53:48] now when you take a seep of the Holy
[1:53:51] Ghost
[1:53:55] it just makes you
[1:53:57] happy that's why
[1:53:59] Pentecost they asked them a question why
[1:54:02] are you drunk at this early
[1:54:06] hour and Peter defended them he said let
[1:54:10] me tell you they are not drunk with
[1:54:15] wine drun with the Holy
[1:54:19] Ghost when you drink the Holy Ghost
[1:54:23] you become
[1:54:24] peaceful you become
[1:54:27] happy you become contented in your
[1:54:33] life if you have your one
[1:54:36] Shir you will wear that one to
[1:54:41] church the first week the second week
[1:54:44] the third
[1:54:46] week and people will be wondering this
[1:54:49] one never changes clothes
[1:54:52] but he's always
[1:54:53] happy what is wrong with him he's always
[1:54:57] happy and always
[1:54:58] clean but having
[1:55:01] one the Holy Spirit does
[1:55:04] that but someone who does not have the
[1:55:06] Holy Spirit will do two things one they
[1:55:09] will be
[1:55:11] dirty he may have 20
[1:55:13] shirts but he will always be
[1:55:19] dirty he can't was any of them the
[1:55:22] spirit of darkness is on
[1:55:26] them and then when they come to church
[1:55:29] they will be so
[1:55:31] sad even on top of what they
[1:55:35] have they will always want to borrow
[1:55:37] what others
[1:55:41] have but brother that Shir is good can I
[1:55:44] use
[1:55:46] it can I use it next
[1:55:49] service can I use it can I use it can I
[1:55:52] use it
[1:55:54] no
[1:55:57] contentment but
[1:55:59] godliness with
[1:56:01] contentment is a great
[1:56:05] gain I remember we used to
[1:56:08] have me and Brother Martin and the
[1:56:10] others those
[1:56:12] days we we didn't even we couldn't
[1:56:15] afford a

[1:56:18] suit leave me
[1:56:19] alone you don't know where we from
[1:56:25] we came from there the Holy Ghost gave
[1:56:28] us this good
[1:56:30] one we used for us we used to we used to
[1:56:33] be given by the by a
[1:56:36] miracle someone gives you a

[1:56:46] [Applause]
[1:56:50] it we have those pictures if if you want
[1:56:52] you can come and we were proud and
[1:56:55] happy you say a small
[1:56:58] man and the coat was
[1:57:02] wearing and you are there
[1:57:08] SM
[1:57:11] Bible now when I see those
[1:57:14] pictures like oh
[1:57:17] God the Holy Spirit really made the fo
[1:57:19] out of us
[1:57:23] but that was
[1:57:25] good that was good because we we we
[1:57:28] didn't have a brain of our
[1:57:32] own is not long ago our friends at that
[1:57:36] time they were
[1:57:43] stying having and
[1:57:48] shorts you know those shops how do they
[1:57:51] call flipping up

[1:58:00] and then you put on something and then
[1:58:01] you know here you do like we used to
[1:58:03] have those
[1:58:05] things but when we came to
[1:58:08] Christ we changed our
[1:58:11] life we changed our
[1:58:14] Channel we changed our desires and
[1:58:18] appetites and we were contented
[1:58:22] with what God gave
[1:58:25] us and with those few things we served
[1:58:27] God
[1:58:30] faithfully and you would just wear that
[1:58:33] Shir that Shir that Shir and that tie

[1:58:46] times you can clearly see it was getting
[1:58:49] breathed by ironing and
