[1:38:48] this we appreciate your giving the
[1:38:52] church appreciates your
[1:38:54] giving God bless you very
[1:38:56] much do you remember the group of some
[1:38:59] sisters I think they were we thought
[1:39:01] they are from Congo they came here some
[1:39:04] time
[1:39:06] back how many remember them they were a
[1:39:08] group of
[1:39:09] them and fellowshipped with us for a few
[1:39:12] weeks and um so after a while I began to
[1:39:16] see money coming
[1:39:19] online and I did not know the name of
[1:39:21] the person
[1:39:23] and so for a while
[1:39:25] now uh the first I think she gave 3
[1:39:29] million the second time about I don't
[1:39:31] remember maybe about $100 I don't
[1:39:33] remember and this time they gave
[1:39:36] $850,000
[1:39:39] so when she gave the I think second or
[1:39:43] third
[1:39:44] time I took it upon myself to contact
[1:39:47] her find out who who is this
[1:39:50] person and uh then I found that uh
[1:39:54] is one she's a daughter of one of those
[1:39:58] older sisters that
[1:40:02] came and her name is Sister
[1:40:05] Christina and um she said she was
[1:40:09] blessed when she was here the
[1:40:11] church and she failed to be a part of
[1:40:14] the of the Vision
[1:40:17] support the purchase of our
[1:40:20] land and so Sister Christina may God
[1:40:22] bless you
[1:40:25] you really
[1:40:27] appreciate
[1:40:29] amen well I believe that the Lord will
[1:40:31] accomplish
[1:40:33] it when God gives a
[1:40:36] vision he somehow
[1:40:39] provides so um I just gave those
[1:40:41] testimonies to show especially those of
[1:40:43] you who attend church
[1:40:47] here if you don't catch the
[1:40:50] vision the blessing will go to someone
[1:40:52] else

[1:41:07] church your land and you must you must
[1:41:11] catch the vision in order to be a
[1:41:13] partaker of that

[1:44:58] determined how many are
[1:45:00] determined I am
[1:45:02] determined to walk in God's
[1:45:06] blessing
[1:45:09] this2 amen some of you have been walking
[1:45:12] in his
[1:45:15] Cur but you must be
[1:45:17] determined Amen to walk in his Blessing
[1:45:21] coming the says the blessing of the Lord
[1:45:24] it maketh rich and he adth no sorrow
[1:45:26] with
[1:45:29] it and in Deuteronomy
[1:45:34] 11 uh if we can turn
[1:45:39] there you remember last year when the
[1:45:41] year was beginning when this year was
[1:45:45] beginning many of you will remember I
[1:45:47] read a scripture out of
[1:45:51] theonomy and read about the blessings
[1:45:54] and the
[1:45:56] curses and here in vers
[1:46:01] 26
[1:46:06] 1126 he
[1:46:10] says behold I said before you this day a
[1:46:13] blessing and a
[1:46:20] curse a blessing
[1:46:23] if they if ye obey the Commandments of
[1:46:25] the Lord your
[1:46:28] God which I command you this
[1:46:31] day
[1:46:33] a if you will not obey the Commandments
[1:46:36] of the Lord your
[1:46:38] God but you turn aside out of the way
[1:46:41] which I command you this day to go after
[1:46:43] other gods which you have not
[1:46:50] known I don't know about you
[1:46:53] but as far as I'm
[1:46:55] concerned I want to walk in the blessing
[1:46:58] of
[1:47:00] God because the curse of God is not
[1:47:05] desirous and you know if you under a
[1:47:09] curse no one else can lift that
[1:47:13] Cur and you know the song leader sang
[1:47:16] this song The Cur of
[1:47:20] sin there is only one who can break a
[1:47:22] cur
[1:47:25] do you know in our
[1:47:27] generation this time we have many
[1:47:30] churches which are called Deliverance
[1:47:34] churches and there are men of God who
[1:47:37] are called powerful men of
[1:47:40] God and these men are the ones who can
[1:47:43] break
[1:47:46] cures so you go in this church and then
[1:47:49] they will tell you you have this so many
[1:47:51] Cur
[1:47:53] and this man will break
[1:47:55] them but when you go to another church
[1:47:58] they will also tell you you have more
[1:48:01] CES so they will try to break
[1:48:03] it after a while you go to another C
[1:48:08] another
[1:48:10] church in another
[1:48:13] C because they will tell you you also
[1:48:16] have Cur so you imagine I mean since you
[1:48:19] gave your life to
[1:48:21] Jesus you you have been under
[1:48:24] cures Cur after Cur what kind of cures
[1:48:27] are these that never
[1:48:29] go because you are going to the wrong
[1:48:32] person to break the
[1:48:35] Cur there is no man who can break a
[1:48:39] cur and there is no man who can cast who
[1:48:42] is
[1:48:45] blessed only God who
[1:48:48] blesses it is only God who cures
[1:48:52] blesses you no man can Cur
[1:48:56] you that is why as a Believer you must
[1:48:58] never fear
[1:49:01] witchcraft you must never fear bad
[1:49:06] Omen you know there are people in this
[1:49:09] world who speak words and those words
[1:49:13] follow how many know
[1:49:16] that yeah there are people in this world
[1:49:18] who do
[1:49:20] that their words can follow
[1:49:23] you and you see people are always living
[1:49:26] in
[1:49:27] fear that someone has cast oh maybe so
[1:49:30] so C so today I want to show you what
[1:49:34] can break any
[1:49:37] Cur but I tell you if you under the
[1:49:40] blessing of
[1:49:41] God there is no words of a man can
[1:49:44] follow
[1:49:46] you there is no enchantment can follow
[1:49:50] you there is no witchcraft can catch
[1:49:55] there is no power of Satan can follow
[1:49:58] you yes Satan has
[1:50:01] power yes cures
[1:50:03] exist yes those words can
[1:50:06] follow but not following
[1:50:10] me or anyone who is in
[1:50:14] Christ as I will show you when I'm
[1:50:16] finishing it says that they that are in
[1:50:18] Christ are a new creation
[1:50:22] so we see that you see God is the one
[1:50:25] who can
[1:50:27] declare a c or a
[1:50:29] blessing and as we are beginning this
[1:50:32] new
[1:50:33] year I am here today as a
[1:50:36] preacher to declare a
[1:50:39] blessing I am not doing it on my
[1:50:43] own I am declaring a blessing God has
[1:50:46] already declared in
[1:50:49] his and I I I will try to demonstrate
[1:50:52] for you you how you can get a
[1:50:56] cur how you can be under a
[1:50:59] cur and how you can break free from
[1:51:04] it and how you can get into a
[1:51:07] blessing praise the name of the
[1:51:10] Lord okay now let us go to the Book of
[1:51:14] Exodus chapter
[1:51:16] 20 we are going to do some reading today
[1:51:18] so I I want to save as much time as I
[1:51:20] can
[1:51:23] so you don't get tired now and God spake
[1:51:26] all this words saying now we are reading
[1:51:28] Exodus
[1:51:30] 20:1 I am the Lord th God which have
[1:51:33] brought thee out of the land of Egypt
[1:51:35] out of the house of
[1:51:45] bondage Thou shalt have no other gods
[1:51:48] before
[1:51:49] me Thou shalt not make unto thee any
[1:51:51] Graven IM or any likeness of anything
[1:51:54] that is in heaven above all that is in
[1:51:56] the earth beneath all that is in the
[1:51:57] water under the
[1:52:08] Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyselves
[1:52:11] to them nor serve them for I the Lord
[1:52:14] thy God I am jealous I'm a jealous God
[1:52:17] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[1:52:20] upon the children unto the third and the
[1:52:22] fourth generation of them that hate
[1:52:42] me I want you to understand I've
[1:52:44] preached on this many
[1:52:47] times and um I've titled it mainly the
[1:52:50] power of the Next Generation
[1:52:53] I want you to understand a principle
[1:52:56] here that there is something that
[1:53:00] happens when you live under a
[1:53:07] cur now you may say well I don't live
[1:53:09] under
[1:53:10] Cur but any
[1:53:13] man who is not in
[1:53:16] Christ is under a
[1:53:20] cur anyone
[1:53:23] because because the Bible says we are
[1:53:25] born in
[1:53:26] sin we are shaped in
[1:53:30] iniquity we come into the
[1:53:32] world speaking
[1:53:35] lies there is no better man or better
[1:53:38] woman without
[1:53:41] Christ and you see I've told you many
[1:53:45] times that anything that defeated your
[1:53:49] parents you will soon realize it is is
[1:53:52] defeating
[1:53:54] you and even many times until you
[1:53:58] yourself make up your
[1:54:01] mind to say I am now making a new
[1:54:06] generation I am starting a new
[1:54:09] generation things
[1:54:13] follow you know because your parents
[1:54:15] were disobedient to
[1:54:17] God they do something you realize you do
[1:54:20] the same thing
[1:54:22] and you see if they were under that cast
[1:54:24] the same thing follows
[1:54:27] him and you see he says H he says I will
[1:54:32] visit the iniquity of the fathers upon
[1:54:34] the
[1:54:39] children not be look he does not judge
[1:54:42] you for the actions of your
[1:54:46] fathers you would be unfair to do
[1:54:49] that but you see it is upon the basis of
[1:54:52] your own
[1:54:56] actions that he judges
[1:54:58] you you see but you see if like I say
[1:55:02] that things follow at certain
[1:55:06] lineage and until you yourself make up
[1:55:09] your
[1:55:11] mind and say but I'm tired of this kind
[1:55:14] of
[1:55:15] condition it's like poverty for
[1:55:17] example do you know that you cannot
[1:55:20] listen some of you Ying stop
[1:55:26] Ying listen
[1:55:28] carefully because I'm speaking very
[1:55:30] important things this
[1:55:31] morning praise the name of the Lord
[1:55:34] praise the name of the Lord praise the
[1:55:37] name of the
[1:55:38] Lord amen did you
[1:55:41] realize that
[1:55:43] poverty is a
[1:55:47] spirit or you did not know some of you
[1:55:50] who think it is spiritual to be
[1:55:55] poor that's why it is impossible for you
[1:55:57] to break
[1:56:00] through what I'm I'm bring bringing
[1:56:02] poverty because it is a common
[1:56:03] denominator in many many
[1:56:08] T but there many other things I could
[1:56:11] use and until someone is saying I'm
[1:56:15] tired
[1:56:17] of they will be as poor as their
[1:56:19] grandfather their great grandfather
[1:56:21] their whatever
[1:56:26] but you see what happens someone just
[1:56:29] accepts says my my grandfather was poor
[1:56:33] they never drove a car my father never
[1:56:36] drove
[1:56:37] a and his father never drove
[1:56:40] a so who am I do I think I am better
[1:56:44] than
[1:56:45] them no it is all right it just runs
[1:56:49] through our family
[1:56:53] am I preaching to someone here this
[1:56:55] morning and now you have
[1:56:57] accepted you have
[1:57:00] agreed and that Spirit of poverty you
[1:57:03] will worship it
[1:57:04] forever and you know poverty goes with
[1:57:08] begging if someone is a begger it means
[1:57:12] they have accepted they
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:16] poor if I begin
[1:57:19] begging you it means I believe I am poor
[1:57:22] and you are
[1:57:26] rich that's why a beggar has no
[1:57:31] choice a beggar takes everything that is
[1:57:34] given because he accepts he is poor he's
[1:57:39] sorry for his
[1:57:40] Str and he needs someone else who is
[1:57:44] Rich to help
[1:57:46] him a beggar has accepted the situ the
[1:57:50] situation
[1:57:53] he has worshiped
[1:57:55] poverty and he has
[1:57:57] agreed I am good for nothing you find
[1:58:00] them sometimes on the
[1:58:02] streets you know he's begging a man a
[1:58:07] man with all limbs
[1:58:11] working no not not even a problem on
[1:58:14] his and his begging it's a spirit which
[1:58:19] has convinced this man that a poor man
[1:58:24] and no one can help
[1:58:27] you to be like others therefore you have
[1:58:30] to beg those who
[1:58:32] have to give to
[1:58:34] you and he has
[1:58:36] accepted now you may say you are not
[1:58:38] like the beggar on the
[1:58:41] street but if you refuse to go apply for
[1:58:43] a
[1:58:44] job if you refuse to go find a job and
[1:58:48] all jobs you think you cannot do any job
[1:58:52] because you think you are not educated
[1:58:54] enough let me tell you when God is
[1:58:57] getting ready to bless
[1:58:59] you he does not base on your
[1:59:04] qualification the blessing of
[1:59:06] God
[1:59:08] in it makes you
[1:59:11] rich it's not the job that makes you
[1:59:14] rich it is the blessing that comes
[1:59:17] from it takes away all the poverty
[1:59:22] now of course this riches is a big word
[1:59:26] here is not only talking about Riches of
[1:59:34] money the blessing of God makes you
[1:59:37] rich you see because you believe you are
[1:59:39] not
[1:59:41] poor you can say enough is enough I have
[1:59:44] been without
[1:59:46] employment for six years for 5 years for
[1:59:49] three four but this time around
[1:59:53] as I am beginning this year I'm going to
[1:59:55] speak my job into
[1:59:57] existence you can even talk the money
[2:00:00] you want to
[2:00:02] ear I'm I'm trying to show you things
[2:00:05] from a spiritual
[2:00:08] perspective I'm not I'm not speaking in
[2:00:10] a kind of
[2:00:12] perspective because God is not a kind of
[2:00:15] God God is a spiritual
[2:00:17] God Amen and you must see things
[2:00:20] spiritually
[2:00:22] to understand what I am
[2:00:24] saying amen go God I've seen it before
[2:00:28] God can leave all those who have the
[2:00:33] qualification and it takes you who
[2:00:35] doesn't have one
[2:00:37] qualification so in other words what
[2:00:39] does it take it takes you as a man as a
[2:00:43] woman to change your
[2:00:46] mindset to say I am not poor enough is
[2:00:50] enough I'm not going to be this way
[2:00:53] anymore I must find a job God must
[2:00:57] provide for me I must buy a car you know
[2:01:01] sometimes you must feel sorry for
[2:01:03] your and you refuse the situation how
[2:01:07] many to refuse the
[2:01:09] situation whatever situation you have
[2:01:11] been in this year you have to come to a
[2:01:14] place where you refuse
[2:01:17] it you may be in a
[2:01:20] situation that is a
[2:01:23] cycle that you know something defeated
[2:01:26] your
[2:01:26] parents and your parents
[2:01:29] parents to you it may not even be
[2:01:32] poverty to you it may be last for
[2:01:36] alcohol to you it might be last for
[2:01:39] women and you said me I have this
[2:01:41] weakness some of you have even called it
[2:01:44] my
[2:01:45] weakness which means you have
[2:01:48] agreed to the failures of your p the
[2:01:52] failures of the generations before you I
[2:01:54] am looking for a
[2:01:56] generation which will not
[2:01:59] agree failures
[2:02:01] whatsoever we are coming to a time we
[2:02:05] must be
[2:02:06] determined to walk in Another
[2:02:10] Blessing not under C but the blessing of
[2:02:15] God hallelujah
[2:02:18] hallelujah there are certain things I
[2:02:20] know defeated my father
[2:02:23] I refuse to accept
[2:02:26] them and I've told you the testimony
[2:02:29] here some of many times I
[2:02:34] refused I see this one defeated my
[2:02:36] father this father me I will not I will
[2:02:41] not accept for that one to defeat it is
[2:02:45] a personal
[2:02:48] choice it's not that D is going to come
[2:02:50] and then fly on you
[2:02:52] you make up your
[2:02:54] mind and say enough is
[2:02:58] enough I'm going to start a new
[2:03:01] chapter so now we see here he says um I
[2:03:06] am the Lord
[2:03:08] God I brought you out of Egypt out of
[2:03:11] the house of bondage you should have no
[2:03:13] other gods before
[2:03:15] you now a god is an object of
[2:03:20] worship something you worship
[2:03:23] something you submit
[2:03:25] to something you
[2:03:27] reng something you fear that is a
[2:03:32] God and now God here is saying do not
[2:03:36] replace
[2:03:38] me for any other
[2:03:42] God do you know what we have done we
[2:03:46] have replaced
[2:03:48] God the word with many other things we
[2:03:53] your
[2:03:55] fear something you respect more than the
[2:03:58] word something you rever more than the
[2:04:02] word something you give your time more
[2:04:05] than the
[2:04:06] word you are worshiping that
[2:04:09] thing something you submit
[2:04:12] to more than the
[2:04:14] word you are worshiping that
[2:04:17] thing but you see God told the
[2:04:19] Israelites you should not worship other
[2:04:23] God you should not make any graving
[2:04:27] image or any likeness of
[2:04:30] anything that is under the under the
[2:04:32] Earth or beneath the
[2:04:35] Earth you will not bow

[2:10:28] stick with my notes because I wanted to
[2:10:29] go through all these things let's see
[2:10:31] how the Lord will lead us okay now we
[2:10:34] look at the children of
[2:10:36] Israel this is what God told them but he
[2:10:40] also told them and he said I God I show
[2:10:48] Mercy thousand
[2:10:51] them that love
[2:10:53] me and keep my
[2:10:56] Commandments God will show
[2:10:59] Mercy to those that love him to those
[2:11:03] that keep his
[2:11:05] word I want to be among those
[2:11:11] coming
[2:11:12] amen but you see what did Israel
[2:11:16] do this is what they did in Exodus 32
[2:11:22] vers from verses
[2:11:24] one and when the people saw that Moses
[2:11:26] delayed to come down out of the mount
[2:11:29] the people gathered themselves together
[2:11:31] and unto Aaron and said unto him up make
[2:11:34] us Gods which shall go before us for as
[2:11:38] for this Moses this Moses the man that
[2:11:41] brought us up out of the land of Egypt
[2:11:43] we what not what is become of him
[2:12:03] and Aaron said unto them break off the
[2:12:05] Golden Earrings which are in the ears of
[2:12:07] your wives of your sons and of your
[2:12:09] daughters and bring them unto
[2:12:19] me that's why believers don't wear
[2:12:24] earrings because earrings has always
[2:12:26] been a sign of
[2:12:29] rebellion Rebellion to
[2:12:32] God you notice that this is one one
[2:12:35] place where they speak about
[2:12:37] earrings and then another another place
[2:12:40] is where you know those who who who
[2:12:43] after hearing the trumpet
[2:12:45] [Music]
[2:12:49] sound and they refuse to go
[2:12:52] out so they would put earrings in their
[2:12:56] ears as a sign they will be a slave
[2:13:01] forever so Believers sisters do not CET
[2:13:05] the
[2:13:09] earrings and all the people break off
[2:13:11] the Golden Earrings which were in the
[2:13:13] ears and brought them unto
[2:13:17] Aon and he received them at their hand
[2:13:22] and fashioned it with a graving
[2:13:26] tool after he had made it a m
[2:13:32] c and they
[2:13:34] said these be thy Gods o
[2:13:39] Israel which brought thee up out of the
[2:13:41] land of of
[2:13:44] Egypt is that
[2:13:48] true do are you following the preaching
[2:13:52] is that
[2:13:54] true and when Aaron saw it he built an
[2:13:57] altar before it and made
[2:14:02] Proclamation and said tomorrow is a
[2:14:05] feast to the
[2:14:07] Lord imagine they saying a fe to the
[2:14:10] Lord when they already having their
[2:14:13] God and they rose up early on the
[2:14:16] morrow and offered burn offerings and
[2:14:19] brought peace offerings and the people
[2:14:21] was sat down to eat and to
[2:14:29] drink and they rose up to
[2:14:32] play praise the Lord so now the Jews
[2:14:36] sinned before
[2:14:38] God the Jews these people they missed
[2:14:41] the
[2:14:43] mark and there they missed the mark they
[2:14:46] did not a they
[2:14:49] missed and there were on the side of the
[2:14:53] cast you know the God had brought them
[2:14:57] out of
[2:14:59] Egypt brought them to this place and he
[2:15:02] was taking them to the promised
[2:15:06] land but before they reached the
[2:15:08] promised
[2:15:09] land they became
[2:15:13] wary they were so
[2:15:16] used to you know coming out of Egypt and
[2:15:20] going somewhere
[2:15:21] they wanted to
[2:15:24] worship man is created to
[2:15:28] worship you are created to
[2:15:32] worship and if you are not worshiping
[2:15:35] God you are worshiping
[2:15:39] Satan you cannot be without
[2:15:43] worship let me tell you a human being
[2:15:47] cannot live without
[2:15:49] worshiping God created
[2:15:52] us with a thing in
[2:15:55] us to to
[2:15:58] worship and if he wanted us to worship
[2:16:02] him but if we don't worship
[2:16:05] him there is an option that the devil
[2:16:07] always
[2:16:09] present that's why when you go to Every
[2:16:11] indigenous
[2:16:14] culture there is

[2:23:04] wrong
[2:23:05] God but we have a right
[2:23:08] God the god of the Bible his name is
[2:23:12] Jesus and when we get into the spirit we
[2:23:16] go high and we receive the true love
[2:23:21] Hallelujah am and this religion makes us
[2:23:24] love
[2:23:26] everybody praise the name of the Lord
[2:23:29] and there are many gos that people bow
[2:23:33] to but also you know we have a god of
[2:23:38] money people in our generation are
[2:23:41] worshiping the god of
[2:23:43] money you find that they will do
[2:23:46] anything and everything to get
[2:23:49] money for money is their
[2:23:52] God they worship it if you fail to come
[2:23:56] to church because of
[2:23:58] money you have missed the
[2:24:01] Mark you are worshiping
[2:24:04] it and I say that without fear

[2:25:08] business because they know they
[2:25:11] praying and yet they are God it's not
[2:25:14] the god of the
[2:25:15] Bible but we Christians who claim to
[2:25:19] have the god of the Bible

[2:29:36] Gods missing the
[2:29:39] mark now listen in the message the
[2:29:41] search of a perfect
[2:29:44] man what is it God condescending to his
[2:29:48] creation
[2:29:50] God wants to be
[2:29:52] worshiped the word god means object of
[2:29:58] worship and it's God trying to to
[2:30:01] condition his
[2:30:05] people so he can get from them what he
[2:30:08] created them
[2:30:10] for he never made you to be something
[2:30:13] else besides a son and a daughter of God
[2:30:20] if you have missed
[2:30:22] that of being a son and daughter of
[2:30:26] God you have Miss the
[2:30:30] mar and remember you are not a son or
[2:30:34] daughter until you filled with the Holy
[2:30:37] Spirit and if you don't have the Holy
[2:30:40] Ghost you have missed the
[2:30:43] M you must be so
[2:30:46] hungry so hungry for it so hungry for
[2:30:51] experience so angry to know
[2:30:53] God in the power of his
[2:30:57] resurrection you see they have
[2:30:59] missed the word sin means to miss the
[2:31:04] mark to miss the mark then if I'm
[2:31:08] shooting at a
[2:31:11] Target at 50
[2:31:14] yard and I
[2:31:16] shoot and I take my gun down and shoot
[2:31:21] and I miss
[2:31:22] it four or five
[2:31:27] in what what has happened my gun needs
[2:31:31] tuning
[2:31:32] up there is something wrong and if I
[2:31:36] miss faith in
[2:31:39] God if I miss to one
[2:31:42] side come back and get tuned
[2:31:45] up and there's only one thing that can
[2:31:47] tune you up
[2:31:50] that's the scripture the holy
[2:31:54] spirit in the Scripture it will tune you
[2:31:58] it will bring you
[2:32:00] directly into the target
[2:32:04] again hallelujah amen I say as we close
[2:32:07] this
[2:32:08] year our guns need tuning
[2:32:12] up we need to walk in God is
[2:32:15] blessing not in the cast and if we are
[2:32:19] missing the
[2:32:20] mark let us tune our
[2:32:23] guns so we can shoot
[2:32:27] direct praise the name of the
[2:32:30] Lord what will tune us
[2:32:32] up the children of Israel had to
[2:32:36] repent whenever they went
[2:32:39] wrong they had to repent for God to
[2:32:42] bring them back again Into The
[2:32:45] Blessing by the way if you want to know
[2:32:47] how God deals with you
[2:32:51] you should see how he deals with
[2:32:53] Israel whenever Israel
[2:32:57] sin God gave them into the hands of
[2:32:59] their
[2:32:59] [Music]
[2:33:02] enemies so I'll give you one example
[2:33:04] there are many but I'll give you
[2:33:06] one turn with me to the Book of Judges
[2:33:12] 3:7 and the children of Israel did evil
[2:33:15] in the sight of the Lord and forgot the
[2:33:17] Lord their God and served balim and the
[2:33:19] Groves
[2:33:20] therefore the anger of the Lord was hot
[2:33:23] hot against Israel and he sold them into
[2:33:26] the hand of the uh this name is quite
[2:33:29] hard but I'll try he sold them into the
[2:33:31] hand of chushan rath king of Mesopotamia
[2:33:36] and the children of Israel served Chan
[2:33:40] ratham um 8 years and when the children
[2:33:43] of Israel Cried unto the Lord the Lord
[2:33:46] raised up a deliverer to the children of
[2:33:49] Israel who delivered them even oel the
[2:33:52] son of kenas CB's Young Brother
[2:34:12] [Music]
[2:34:24] [Music]
[2:34:44] whenever Israel
[2:34:46] repented God His blessings followed them
[2:34:50] whenever they sin they did what God told
[2:34:53] them not to
[2:34:55] do he committed them into the hands of
[2:34:58] their
[2:34:59] enemies there are many of you who are
[2:35:02] displaced from your
[2:35:04] Homeland because of not working
[2:35:08] right you need to tune your
[2:35:13] guns and maybe we'll take this um right
[2:35:16] from Genesis to see and study properly
[2:35:18] the blessing of God
[2:35:24] Genesis 121 it says now the Lord had
[2:35:26] said unto Abraham get thee out of thy
[2:35:28] country and from thy country and from
[2:35:30] thy Father's House unto the land that I
[2:35:32] will show thee and I will make of thee a
[2:35:34] great nation and I'll bless thee and
[2:35:36] make thy name great and thou sht be a
[2:35:38] blessing
[2:35:56] and I will bless them that bless thee
[2:35:57] and Cur them that cast thee and in thee
[2:36:00] shall all the families of the earth be
[2:36:09] blessed Hallelujah I want you to see
[2:36:12] Abraham
[2:36:14] here um Abraham had his
[2:36:17] father but God
[2:36:20] brought his
[2:36:21] word
[2:36:24] amen listen very care whenever God
[2:36:27] brings his
[2:36:28] word his word is a
[2:36:33] separator you cannot Remain the way you
[2:36:38] are you cannot remain with your
[2:36:41] friends things cannot continue
[2:36:44] normally are you hearing what I'm saying
[2:36:47] you have to accept
[2:36:50] the word of God to
[2:36:52] separate from the
[2:36:54] world when God separates you it is
[2:36:58] because he wants to begin a new
[2:37:02] generation that will walk in the
[2:37:04] blessing of
[2:37:06] God I remember from the time I was in
[2:37:09] school I was always
[2:37:12] different because I
[2:37:14] accepted the word of God to
[2:37:17] separate I was young but I accepted the
[2:37:21] word of God to separation and you know
[2:37:23] my friends they would all see me and
[2:37:26] call me all sorts of
[2:37:28] names one of them I remember it
[2:37:31] vividly they called
[2:37:38] me yes
[2:37:42] imagine time has pass they used to call
[2:37:45] me do you know why because I used to
[2:37:49] talk against what they were
[2:37:51] doing everyone at
[2:37:54] school this might appeal to some of your
[2:37:57] students everyone at school
[2:38:01] brother everyone was
[2:38:06] coupling and they would know that one is
[2:38:09] for the other
[2:38:12] one but when I believe this
[2:38:14] message I realized that is not my life
[2:38:19] and you know one thing you do if you
[2:38:22] want to
[2:38:23] overcome you must always talk about who
[2:38:25] you
[2:38:27] are but if you find a brother a Believer
[2:38:31] who is in any
[2:38:33] community and they don't know what to
[2:38:35] stand for you are a
[2:38:39] compromiser you doing what they
[2:38:45] doing that's why sometimes we tell you
[2:38:47] call us we preach for your friends
[2:38:52] and you fear because your friends will
[2:38:56] tell you you mean you believe those
[2:38:58] things why didn't you
[2:39:00] tell you are
[2:39:03] hiding you are not a genuine
[2:39:06] believer but a true genuine
[2:39:09] Bel wherever you are that is a
[2:39:14] Pulpit where God has blessed
[2:39:17] you it could be your
[2:39:20] neighborhood it could be a place of work
[2:39:24] it could be a school it could be your
[2:39:27] home that is a
[2:39:29] [Music]
[2:39:30] pit you must stand for
[2:39:33] God tell your brothers about what you
[2:39:36] believe tell your coworkers about what
[2:39:38] you believe tell your friends about what
[2:39:41] you believe tell them about the Judgment
[2:39:44] of
[2:39:45] God coming to the world tell them about
[2:39:48] the rapture
[2:39:50] tell them about the name of
[2:39:52] Jesus and bapti him in the name of
[2:39:55] Jesus are you hearing me church but if
[2:39:58] you are shying
[2:40:00] away it means you are not walking in the
[2:40:04] blessing it means you are not
[2:40:07] separated but a True
[2:40:09] Believer lives a separate
[2:40:12] life
[2:40:14] separated for the cause of the
[2:40:18] gospel God said
[2:40:20] Abraham go away from your
[2:40:23] country go away from your
[2:40:26] country and from your father's
[2:40:28] house oh hallelujah hallelujah God
[2:40:32] separated him from
[2:40:34] everything everything he knew everything
[2:40:38] he saw everything he grew up with God
[2:40:42] separated
[2:40:44] him we must live as Believers separated
[2:40:47] life in 2025
[2:40:54] and then how many want to live separated
[2:40:58] Liv amen I'm one of them then he says I
[2:41:02] will make you a great
[2:41:07] nation did you know a nation is going to
[2:41:10] come out of
[2:41:12] me a nation is going to come out of
[2:41:15] you if you are
[2:41:17] separated that's why God doesn't want
[2:41:20] Believers to Mar
[2:41:24] unbelievers because it will
[2:41:27] interrupt the
[2:41:30] bloodline are you hearing me he wants a
[2:41:33] Believer to be married to a
[2:41:36] Believer both of them are a
[2:41:40] nation God doesn't want you to be like
[2:41:44] uh like this um you know Esa and Jacob
[2:41:50] they were both in one
[2:41:52] womb and he told the woman two nations
[2:41:56] are in the
[2:41:59] womb you know since that time since the
[2:42:02] flood anyone can give birth to
[2:42:09] serp but my wife prayed a
[2:42:13] prayer and I and I I think it's a very
[2:42:16] good
[2:42:17] prayer she asked
[2:42:19] God she said God I'm praying this give
[2:42:24] me only your
[2:42:27] seat did the Bible say God can give the
[2:42:30] desires of our
[2:42:32] heart so I agreed with we agreed she
[2:42:35] testified to me and I agreed all the
[2:42:39] children God will give to us they will
[2:42:41] be your
[2:42:43] seed and we believe it so I'm not one of
[2:42:46] those who believe we give bir the flesh
[2:42:50] we are not flesh to begin
[2:42:54] with we are Spirit
[2:42:56] beings and God must give us his
[2:43:00] children I'm I'm declaring to you what I
[2:43:02] believe this is my personal
[2:43:05] belief so we are ready to stand for that
[2:43:11] we are ready to F the devil whenever he
[2:43:15] comes even when he came you know
[2:43:17] remember my younger child one of my boys
[2:43:20] was being attacked but I'm sure those
[2:43:23] demons must
[2:43:25] have you remember that testimony I gave
[2:43:27] it to you here they
[2:43:29] came yes I'm talking spiritual things
[2:43:32] but they happen
[2:43:34] physically and they came to take the
[2:43:36] life out of this
[2:43:39] child and we kicked them out they
[2:43:44] left there is something I want you to
[2:43:46] there's something about birth
[2:43:50] because you see the devil wants to own
[2:43:54] soul he wants to claim let me that's the
[2:43:56] right
[2:43:57] word you remember Sister Ruth when you
[2:43:59] had your boy
[2:44:01] what same thing sister
[2:44:04] Anita let me tell you there is always
[2:44:06] something happening during that
[2:44:09] moment the devil wants to possess
[2:44:13] his and many of the people in this world
[2:44:15] are possessed
[2:44:20] I hope I don't have many
[2:44:23] here you know until you want to break
[2:44:25] out of
[2:44:26] something but there is something holding
[2:44:28] you it looks like something is
[2:44:32] pulling why because you are
[2:44:35] possessed you can't break out of
[2:44:38] such I'm showing you today how to break
[2:44:40] out of such a
[2:44:44] thing and after you broken out of it you
[2:44:47] believe for your next generation
[2:44:51] they to will walk in the same blessing
[2:44:53] you
[2:44:55] working Hallelujah and God told Abraham
[2:44:59] after you have separated
[2:45:01] yourself I will make you
[2:45:03] great I you amen out of you will be a
[2:45:06] great
[2:45:07] nation I will bless you where did The
[2:45:11] Riches of Abraham come
[2:45:12] from it came from
[2:45:15] God my riches are going to come from God

[2:45:22] God Abraham was one of the richest men
[2:45:25] in his
[2:45:28] time sister go to school get a job but I

[2:45:43] excel better than all the
[2:45:47] others and many times
[2:45:49] people think it is their hard
[2:45:53] work there are some people who come and
[2:45:55] we pray for
[2:45:56] them said pastor pray for me I need a
[2:45:59] breakthrough on this and you pray for
[2:46:02] the person and after one year God does
[2:46:06] it and then you see someone who is very
[2:46:13] proud and look at
[2:46:20] the issue is you are
[2:46:23] forgetting that it is not your
[2:46:27] hard it is the blessing
[2:46:31] of and when God gives you his
[2:46:35] Blessing be

[3:03:10] his life had
[3:03:12] changed he now knew he cannot
[3:03:14] die he now knew he was a super human
[3:03:20] instead of being in your comfort zone
[3:03:23] comforting yourself all the time but yet
[3:03:26] you know you need a
[3:03:29] change be
[3:03:31] determined
[3:03:33] 2025 to walk in God's
[3:03:37] Place Hallelujah I don't know about you
[3:03:41] but I am
[3:03:44] determined to walk in God's
[3:03:46] bless only him who can give us the
[3:03:50] blessing and without that
[3:03:52] blessing the only option is a
[3:03:56] cast you can't go to the
[3:03:58] Rapture if you are not filled in your
[3:04:01] soul with the Holy
[3:04:05] Spirit you
[3:04:07] cannot you're wasting your time if you
[3:04:11] either go to the
[3:04:12] world go back to the world oh receive
[3:04:16] the Holy Ghost
[3:04:18] because if you don't go back to the
[3:04:20] world and you don't receive the ho ghost
[3:04:23] you are only a shark es cting the
[3:04:29] seed Pastor those are hard
[3:04:32] words that's the truth the shark shall
[3:04:36] not
[3:04:37] be with
[3:04:41] the these two
[3:04:43] boys if you will notice their
[3:04:45] nature one of them was a spiritual
[3:04:48] man that was Jacob and and and and the
[3:04:52] kind of man was
[3:04:54] es but they were both
[3:04:57] religious and that same thing has taken
[3:04:59] place all down through the
[3:05:03] age and
[3:05:05] spiritual es represented the man of the
[3:05:09] earth
[3:05:11] natural
[3:05:12] religious but never
[3:05:15] able you know you always cannot overcome
[3:05:19] it wasn't in
[3:05:21] him he couldn't do it he never was in
[3:05:26] him to be able to climb aast the things
[3:05:29] of the
[3:05:37] world
[3:05:40] for is after
[3:05:45] movies and I don't know what they watch
[3:05:47] these days those are the names of movies
[3:05:50] in my
[3:05:52] time why do they watch these
[3:05:56] days oh our people don't watch movies
[3:05:58] here God bless
[3:06:00] you but if you are there God is seeing
[3:06:04] you and your
[3:06:06] appetite is only after those
[3:06:09] things only you glue on your screen or
[3:06:12] TV
[3:06:15] whatever you are seeing those things
[3:06:18] filthy
[3:06:19] images of men and women slopping and
[3:06:24] kissing evil spirits enter
[3:06:27] you you can't
[3:06:29] overcome but you see that's
[3:06:32] scality yes Pastor you mean we shouldn't
[3:06:36] watch
[3:06:37] movies a true genuine Holy Ghost Field
[3:06:41] Believer cannot feed on those
[3:06:45] things you cannot
[3:06:48] imagine Jesus
[3:06:50] sitting watching you know
[3:06:53] immorality watching Men
[3:06:57] curing imagine Brother s
[3:07:00] there and saying
[3:07:02] Oh Brother po increase the
[3:07:10] volume say what did he say you see
[3:07:14] Hollywood came right from the pits of H
[3:07:19] and it is f in the whole
[3:07:22] world and you find these days Believers
[3:07:24] have those things in their
[3:07:27] home
[3:07:29] 2025 clean up your
[3:07:33] house throw those stuff
[3:07:35] out it doesn't belong in a believer's
[3:07:39] home can I have a resounding Amen
[3:07:45] on but Jacob it was just so easy for him
[3:07:49] to do
[3:07:50] it jaob one purpose jaob
[3:07:53] had and that was the he longed for the
[3:07:58] birth no matter how he got
[3:08:02] it just so he got
[3:08:04] it and that Spirit of that one
[3:08:08] birth is still represented in the world
[3:08:12] today it is coming to our head
[3:08:15] now the spiritual believer
[3:08:18] and the man and the believer no one
[3:08:22] could say they wasn't both
[3:08:25] religious both of them were they didn't
[3:08:29] say that one served an
[3:08:31] idol and the other one God they were
[3:08:34] both Servants of
[3:08:36] God now pay close
[3:08:39] attention to the scriptures now on this
[3:08:42] subject I'm sure it will help you not
[3:08:46] everyone that sayth Lord
[3:08:48] Lord will enter in but the one that doth
[3:08:52] the will of My
[3:08:54] Father which is in heaven now if you
[3:08:58] notice Jacob had one thing that he
[3:09:02] wanted because according to the word the
[3:09:06] blessings of the good thing laid in that
[3:09:11] birth and Jacob that was his only
[3:09:15] objective the only thing he had in
[3:09:19] mind was get that
[3:09:22] birth and Es despised it the one that
[3:09:26] actually had it despised
[3:09:28] it he was ashamed of it but Jacob wanted
[3:09:33] it of how
[3:09:37] got you see he didn't despise it there
[3:09:40] are some people who despise
[3:09:42] it you know when people Fe the ho all
[3:09:45] sorts of things happen
[3:09:48] crying mu
[3:09:51] coming tears coming cry
[3:09:54] like so people will despise
[3:09:57] that but let me tell you that's the
[3:10:00] thing that
[3:10:01] Jacob
[3:10:05] wanted Jacob means
[3:10:09] supplanter deceiver but after finding
[3:10:11] and coming into possession of that
[3:10:15] Beth he was changed
[3:10:18] that's the kind change he was then
[3:10:19] called
[3:10:22] Israel a prince with the
[3:10:24] Lord who had wrestled with him they
[3:10:27] canot believe today oh as long as I go
[3:10:30] to
[3:10:31] church and do a
[3:10:33] right what difference does it
[3:10:35] make that is Esau's
[3:10:39] group he still makes
[3:10:41] fun and despises the
[3:10:44] birth he makes fun of it and despises
[3:10:50] did you see the other
[3:10:51] brother
[3:10:54] crying
[3:10:56] imagine's
[3:10:59] group did not come
[3:11:03] today's
[3:11:05] group he still makes fun and despises
[3:11:07] the B
[3:11:08] right he doesn't care for it but Jacob
[3:11:13] loved
[3:11:14] it and the spiritual man today
[3:11:18] and spiritual woman that
[3:11:21] selected predestinated of God to come to
[3:11:25] eternal
[3:11:26] life if they have to sell everything
[3:11:29] they if they have to take their name off
[3:11:32] of every
[3:11:36] Church they still want that b
[3:11:39] right it's the only thing that matters
[3:11:42] to
[3:11:43] them just get that b right that's all no
[3:11:49] matter how what level they have to come
[3:11:51] on if they have to get down to the
[3:11:54] Altar and they cry and they boohoo if
[3:11:59] they have to run through the places and
[3:12:04] go back and make things
[3:12:06] right if they have to go and repent this
[3:12:11] one Whatever
[3:12:13] it they'll be
[3:12:16] crazy will sell what they got they'll
[3:12:20] give away
[3:12:21] everything you you cannot receive the
[3:12:24] Holy
[3:12:25] Spirit if you are not ready to lose your
[3:12:30] digity
[3:12:31] everything they have and become a
[3:12:34] pilgrim and a
[3:12:37] stranger it doesn't matter to them they
[3:12:40] want the
[3:12:41] bir that's all they interested
[3:12:44] in the bir now don't blame them people
[3:12:49] they can't help
[3:12:50] it they were predestinated to
[3:12:55] that I am one of
[3:12:57] them they are elected to
[3:13:01] eat and then we see that these two can
[3:13:04] and spiritual
[3:13:06] people that's the way it's always
[3:13:09] happened that's the way it is today it
[3:13:12] always has been that way hallelujah
[3:13:15] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's
[3:13:17] the way
[3:13:19] Brethren that's the
[3:13:21] way it is
[3:13:23] today you have to be ready to do
[3:13:26] everything you
[3:13:28] can to receive that birth right and I
[3:13:30] believe that the coming of the Lord is
[3:13:33] near don't
[3:13:35] presume that you are filled with the
[3:13:37] Holy
[3:13:38] Spirit if you're
[3:13:40] struggling you know you are
[3:13:43] struggling find him
[3:13:46] [Music]
[3:13:49] if you do not know
[3:13:51] how come come meet us we will help
[3:13:55] you therefore If any man be in
[3:13:59] Christ who is in Christ he that is
[3:14:02] filled with the
[3:14:06] Hool so whenever we read that
[3:14:09] scripture if you don't have the
[3:14:11] Hool you are not
[3:14:14] included therefore if being
[3:14:18] Christ he is a new
[3:14:22] creature old things that passed
[3:14:25] away All Things
[3:14:29] become there is there for
[3:14:32] now no
[3:14:35] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[3:14:38] Jesus who walk not after the
[3:14:42] flesh but after the
[3:14:45] SP no condemnation
[3:14:47] that means no
[3:14:49] cast that means they in the
[3:14:53] blessing why because they in
[3:14:56] Christ when a man is in Christ he is
[3:15:00] well beyond the cast of
[3:15:03] Sin God has given him the
[3:15:06] viory and he's working in
[3:15:10] God hallelujah
[3:15:13] hallelujah I'm done with my sermon but I
[3:15:15] want to read you one quote out
[3:15:20] how many want to hear
[3:15:23] it praise
[3:15:25] God brother bam was asked a question
[3:15:28] question number
[3:15:30] 12 brother bam I want to know the place
[3:15:34] where I can tie
[3:15:37] down and
[3:15:39] say this man has the Holy
[3:15:43] Ghost because he did this all this woman
[3:15:46] has
[3:15:48] because she did how many would love to
[3:15:50] hear
[3:15:52] that and he says there's not a way in
[3:15:54] the world for you to know
[3:15:58] it that's right there's not a way in the
[3:16:01] world for you to know
[3:16:03] it God is the
[3:16:05] judge we are not the church just preach
[3:16:09] the gospel leave a fellow come to me
[3:16:12] here some time ago I was preaching about
[3:16:15] what I said the other night
[3:16:18] he come up to my house and he said
[3:16:21] brother Bram I wanted I want to be to
[3:16:24] get rid of my
[3:16:26] sins I want to be a
[3:16:29] Christian he sat on my
[3:16:31] porch he said I heard about a great man
[3:16:34] an internationally known Man by the name
[3:16:36] Billy
[3:16:40] Graham he said I went to his
[3:16:42] meetings and all that wants to become a
[3:16:44] Christian he said hold up your hand and
[3:16:47] Christ as
[3:16:50] your so I raised my
[3:16:53] hand he said now all stand we will have
[3:16:58] a
[3:16:59] prayer so I stayed and I
[3:17:02] prayed just as sincere as I could
[3:17:05] be he said but it did not do me
[3:17:10] any so he said then I went down to or
[3:17:13] Robert's
[3:17:15] meeting he said I had of him and I had
[3:17:18] they they had all such
[3:17:23] Joy said I went down to or Roberts and I
[3:17:25] asked him what must I do to become a
[3:17:30] Christian he said you get back
[3:17:32] there I told him I had held up my hand
[3:17:35] at Billy GRS he said you stay in that
[3:17:38] inquiry room in there until you are so
[3:17:40] happy you speak with times
[3:17:52] he said I went in there and I prayed
[3:17:54] till I spoke with
[3:17:57] Tong he said I it come out but it didn't
[3:18:01] do me no
[3:18:03] good he said and then I went to another
[3:18:06] meeting and he told me I hadn't been
[3:18:09] Sanctified
[3:18:11] yet said I have to get Sanctified and
[3:18:14] get happy and shout and get enough job
[3:18:18] so I prayed and
[3:18:20] prayed till I
[3:18:22] shouted but yet
[3:18:24] still I said
[3:18:27] brother every one of those things are
[3:18:30] correct every one of those things them
[3:18:32] things are
[3:18:33] good holding up your hand speaking with
[3:18:36] Tong shouting I believe in every bit
[3:18:41] of but yet that is not the thing
[3:18:48] it is accepting the person Christ
[3:18:54] Jesus these things are
[3:18:58] attributes shouting speaking in t
[3:19:02] running shouting crying praying
[3:19:06] shattering that is just attributes that
[3:19:11] follow that
[3:19:13] follow they will always follow
[3:19:21] okay the first thing is to accept the
[3:19:23] person Christ
[3:19:26] Jes there is no evidence that we would
[3:19:29] say
[3:19:31] say because a man
[3:19:35] cries I've seen man cry and cry and cry
[3:19:39] [Music]
[3:19:41] tears and cry crocodile tears
[3:19:48] and he's still just as big as a sinner
[3:19:50] as he could
[3:19:53] [Music]
[3:19:56] be listen Jesus has nothing but
[3:20:04] sheep Jesus has nothing but
[3:20:09] sheep is that right the shepherd knows
[3:20:12] his sheep anybody in here ever hear a
[3:20:15] God cry
[3:20:19] well brother you better be a Shepherd if
[3:20:21] you want to know the
[3:20:23] difference a goat will cry just exactly
[3:20:26] like a
[3:20:28] sheep let a little old Billy Goat get
[3:20:31] hung up out there
[3:20:35] somewhere and a little ship on the one
[3:20:39] side and then the same just the
[3:20:43] same so when we talk about
[3:20:45] crying the holy spirit is not
[3:20:50] crying someone can
[3:20:52] cry and remain the same old old
[3:20:57] sinner so if it's
[3:21:00] crying is not the thing that we can
[3:21:03] point
[3:21:05] to although that follows it
[3:21:09] right sheep can cry and God can
[3:21:12] cry are you with me so
[3:21:15] far and had them down at the altar just
[3:21:20] crying crying out to
[3:21:23] God oh God just so being away like
[3:21:28] that God and a got all the
[3:21:36] time that's right
[3:21:39] shouting well my have seen them
[3:21:43] shout and they ran across the floor
[3:21:47] and jump up and
[3:21:49] down now you say brother Bram you don't
[3:21:52] believe in
[3:21:52] cry don't take me
[3:21:55] wrong sure I Believe In Christ but I'm
[3:21:58] saying that is no
[3:22:02] evidence because they both
[3:22:04] cry I've seen them shout just as hard as
[3:22:08] they could
[3:22:09] sh yes sir and just carrying on like
[3:22:13] that and there's a lot of them amongst
[3:22:15] you
[3:22:17] what I'm talking about I've heard them
[3:22:19] speak with tongues go out and live any
[3:22:22] kind of a
[3:22:23] life just do
[3:22:26] anything that was no
[3:22:28] sign but you say you against
[3:22:30] it oh no I believe in speaking in t it
[3:22:35] is God's gift in the
[3:22:37] church if I would take it out I have if
[3:22:40] I take it out I would have to take a
[3:22:43] part of God out
[3:22:46] take my
[3:22:47] tongue out of my body here I wouldn't
[3:22:50] have to be a complete
[3:22:52] body the body of Jesus has tongues in
[3:22:55] it the body of Jesus Christ has
[3:22:58] tongues and you take it out you take a
[3:23:02] part of
[3:23:04] Christ so many people when they hear
[3:23:06] Brother bam talk about these
[3:23:08] things they begin hitting on speaking in
[3:23:13] Tong and many many many message
[3:23:15] preachers when they preach about T
[3:23:16] they're
[3:23:19] negative but they F to be
[3:23:23] balanced clears it he says no if you
[3:23:26] take out
[3:23:27] Tong it's not a full body the body must
[3:23:31] have
[3:23:32] Tong it's a part of it but he saying it
[3:23:36] is simply not the
[3:23:39] evidence that you can zero on to say so
[3:23:42] and so f
[3:23:47] but it is accepting the person Christ
[3:23:52] Jesus and these other
[3:23:55] things they come right on
[3:23:58] in and they fit
[3:24:02] together let every member in this body
[3:24:05] this
[3:24:06] morning let this little group of
[3:24:09] people if you could pull the curtains
[3:24:11] down along on each
[3:24:14] side where the church had
[3:24:17] and every person in
[3:24:19] here receive
[3:24:22] the Christ
[3:24:25] Jesus if it
[3:24:27] did if it did it happened there would
[3:24:31] never be a
[3:24:33] fast no
[3:24:35] argument there would just be perfect
[3:24:40] love yet you would still believe this
[3:24:42] and believe that but it would just be so
[3:24:45] full of love
[3:24:50] that's it how you know that's one of the
[3:24:53] ways you know is when someone is so full
[3:24:55] of
[3:24:58] perfect now Jesus said by their fruits
[3:25:01] you shall know
[3:25:02] that and the fruit of the spirit
[3:25:05] is love joy peace long suffering
[3:25:11] goodness meekness
[3:25:14] gentl I'll give give you my
[3:25:19] estimation now I love this part listen
[3:25:21] to
[3:25:22] very I'll give you now the prophet is
[3:25:25] giving us his
[3:25:27] estimation of what he thinks that the
[3:25:30] closest
[3:25:33] thing to ear
[3:25:37] evidence that a man is a
[3:25:40] Christian than anything I know
[3:25:44] of you know what it is
[3:25:47] is a question you know what it is it
[3:25:51] says it is travail
[3:25:56] [Music]
[3:25:59] of
[3:26:01] [Music]
[3:26:02] of a person that's always
[3:26:07] hungry
[3:26:12] fting they just simply day and night
[3:26:16] they just can't stand it they've got to
[3:26:19] do something for
[3:26:21] God they are full of
[3:26:24] love they just so
[3:26:27] travailing all the
[3:26:30] time the Bible said he that go for
[3:26:32] sowing in
[3:26:34] tears will doubtless return again
[3:26:38] rejoicing singing with him precious
[3:26:43] Chief if this church I would say this
[3:26:46] morning
[3:26:48] this group of
[3:26:49] people and God say now look William Bram
[3:26:52] I'm going to make you answer for that
[3:26:53] group of people what you tell them now
[3:26:56] do you want them all to
[3:27:05] shout do you want the people all to
[3:27:08] sh he sure I want them to shout do you
[3:27:13] want them to speak with Tong all
[3:27:17] I want them every one of them do you
[3:27:19] want them to all dance the
[3:27:21] spirit I want every one of
[3:27:24] them all right well that's very good but
[3:27:28] what would you rather have them to
[3:27:31] [Music]
[3:27:33] do I would say I would rather have a
[3:27:38] church that had such a
[3:27:42] burden on their
[3:27:44] heart for
[3:27:49] prayer that they stayed at this
[3:27:53] Altar and would be here
[3:27:56] day and
[3:27:58] night and everything
[3:28:01] else and in their
