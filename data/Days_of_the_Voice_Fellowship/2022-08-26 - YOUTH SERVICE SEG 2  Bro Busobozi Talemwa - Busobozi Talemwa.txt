========================================
[Music] if you want to be a doctor the world you're not speak your power and switch god will be higher than it is you know at the end of this service all of you follow this principle we are going to have some religious fanatics hallelujah or spiritual phonetics let me call it that way oh that was sorry which is a good thing but to the world need to do is to drive with the five millimeters just one time only and you know you can break it and then go and repent and then you say no gamba i'm a [Music] nevermind without christ now and what i'm speaking to you is what has guided my life [Music] okay now did you notice that not many people raised up their hands that's what i expected because i know you are struggling in your mind to even believe what our society has told us to make choices [Music] that when you make a choice that is not popular you are looked on down and you looked at somebody who is not serious as someone who is actually a fool um why do you think that brother banham would use the words like audible or was the right children who said that the people were referring to the christians like that at school i used to have what they used to call me is what prophet has a man of all his labor which he has taken under the sun one generation passes away and another generation comes but they are the fight forever a the wind goes towards the south and turns about onto the north it wallets about continually and the wind returns again according to his sockets [Music] all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full and the place from whence the rivers come fifa they return again all things are full of labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing not the ear filled with hearing every interview telling the thing that has been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing understand a chariot you believe because you are told by your trainers and teachers that you are going to change the world ok and you actually believe it is that now let me ask you a question who here has a new idea that has never been before is that whatever has been [Music] [Music] all these fashions just keep repeating themselves you know did you realize we were working in a circle it's what solomon is saying all the way towards the surah [Applause] and suffering the people we know today isaac newton isaac newton mentioned them even those who claim they have landed on the moon for the first time you will be surprised to know that there were others who had landed there before them that song so invented about the which is much greater than the one we had today before [Applause] before the days of the flood the world which android do we have now which android do we have now 12 112 okay 112 112 you don't even know what you're talking about you are in the stone age but let me tell you that's a very old version compared to what they had there and the regulations before name remedy civilizations have been rotating is and the one of hallelujah hallelujah and the only thing you can seek out and you know it is sure it you is own them everything else is changed and will change and there is no new thing there was someone like you before you why do you want i don't mean the behavior of the flesh as i mean the soul and the desire of god in your soul that and god are permanent and everything else in the world yeah and whatever you think you're going to do has been done before by somebody else hey maybe you're not the only one joking that people are what where are you because there you go you ever thought about trying to do something new and then you when you did some survey you found out somebody else had already done it let me have this business that's why people do surveys you it was just a waste of time so if you invest your money in something before you making a good survey you will make a loss do you know why mandirachi there is a reason why others are not doing it because if you thought you were intelligent and more wiser than all those that came before you first find out why they did find out whether they were believers or not for instance the man who invented the printing press the one who invented the recorder it was used so don't think you're going to have an idea out of god if you don't make good number one in your life your idea has failed before [Music] [Applause] it is he that works hallelujah amen is the same yesterday today forever be very catholic so i beat the people inside siddhartha who thinks they can be something without god what a waste of time no you know listen oh my i'm telling you i wish i had four hours to preach to you that is singing but didn't say when you woulda but don't worry let them fight i'll keep my words these are interesting facts listen listen we continue with our verse okay where are we where that they were is there anybody who was following what would go down which verse we at verse eight oh no there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come for with those that shall come after such a word and here he speaks solomon wrote this you surah you coming for us not for his generation he is telling us i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem abandonment i went to their one of their shrines i don't know how they call it and uh you know they checked ganja banu in jaga and they they say for them they don't meditate so so i wanted to learn about them for me today you know just you know they also have prophets never never not be and it will deceive you unless you are an elect the bible says it is so close the devil will be so close that he will deceive the very elect if it was possible if [Laughter] but sometimes you come and hug people and they feel like oh god believe me there was so much followers but as i went i walked out never suruma i was with the brother paul from nairobi i know that paul had already tested this thing in his youth and so he knew this thing very well but he was also that my camera my big camera which i just bought oh do not trust the world the way she can see hallelujah me now when sin is around you hey you feel like this is a real deal for sure even what again you do other snakes you know snake is very wise when it wants to eat birds foreign neighborhood and it's just changing its colors black white red so as the birds are in there in the trees because the way i'm seeing just be here is [Music] so you go there and you think that because so and so did it again i never go in there i've heard many people say that you know and you look at him it seems as if everything is okay even if i also don't know what he's going through stick with what you're supposed to do naturally for all this wanted okay i the preacher was a king over israel in jerusalem i hope someone will do that today can you sing about i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under the heaven this soul travail has god given to the sons of man to be exercise their way names and i have seen never all [Music] spirit attaining education is of the devil so you mean we should should be illiterate oh go to school do what you have to find a job whatever i have seen okay right that that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is one thing cannot be numbered verse 15. and i've gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in jerusalem yeah my heart had a great experience of wisdom and knowledge against manchester [Music] against manchester united and knowledge and i gave my heart to no wisdom and to know madness and fully perceived that this also is vexation of spirits okay fine i'm going to be a lecturer i'm going to be rather i'm going to be uh i'm going to to to to to go and get a phd phd whatever you find some people who are just there but in the village they are always wasting their time they don't work they don't shower
