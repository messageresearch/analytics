[10:54] to the Book of Revelation
[10:59] Hallelujah
[11:02] Revelation chapter 5.
[11:09] Hallelujah
[11:11] Revelation chapter 5.
[11:16] it starts like this
[11:19] from verse one
[11:22] and I saw in the right hand of him
[11:26] that sit on the throne a book written
[11:29] within and on the back side sealed with
[11:33] Seven Seals
[11:34] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[11:37] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[11:41] the book to lose the seals thereof
[11:44] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth under
[11:49] the Earth were able to open the book
[11:51] neither to look their own and I wept
[11:54] much because no man was found worthy to
[11:59] open and read the book neither to look
[12:02] their own
[12:39] [Music]
[13:00] God bless the world
[13:04] Hallelujah I'm happy to see you
[13:07] I never give I never feel like I'm a
[13:11] guest
[13:12] this is always my home
[13:15] and it will be my home
[13:17] Hallelujah and I would like to bring
[13:20] much greetings from where I Fellowship
[13:22] from House of Fellowship
[13:27] the Saints the brothers and the
[13:29] ministers have sent their lovely
[13:31] greetings
[13:34] thank you for receiving
[13:37] from Addis ABA bibleway Church
[13:41] they have also seen their lives
[13:46] thank you very much
[13:49] I'm very happy to see Mama Lisa
[13:53] she have done a lot in our lives
[13:57] spiritual and physical
[13:59] she never speaks out
[14:02] but behind she has
[14:11] today my subject will be the revelation
[14:14] of the Seven Seas
[14:20] there are many teachings that will make
[14:22] it assume it is very hard to
[14:24] received
[14:28] there are many doctrines to make it look
[14:31] it's very heavy for people
[14:33] is
[14:35] but I believe today we will receive it
[14:38] in a very simplified way
[14:42] hallelujah amen because God revealed
[14:45] himself in Simplicity
[14:48] Hallelujah he was never in big things
[14:53] he was never in public
[14:57] people will make it very complicated
[15:01] and when Jesus Christ the Messiah comes
[15:16] so we can see here in the Book of
[15:18] Revelation
[15:20] there is a there is a a special book one
[15:25] way
[15:26] and this book was sealed with Seven
[15:28] Seals
[15:33] [Music]
[15:35] because no one were worthy to open the
[15:38] book
[15:40] not only to open the books
[15:43] but to look on the books
[15:49] why would he whip what makes that spoke
[15:53] so special
[15:55] what makes it so important that you
[15:58] whipped
[16:01] why was it no man was he or in heaven
[16:29] and put it
[16:36] [Music]
[17:06] [Music]
[17:28] and those were still in Seven Seals
[17:31] Hallelujah
[17:46] let us read from Genesis
[17:53] Genesis chapter 3
[17:55] .
[18:00] Genesis
[18:10] no the serpent was more subtle than any
[18:14] beast of the field with the Lord God
[18:16] made
[18:18] and he said unto the woman he is that
[18:21] God said he shall not eat of every two
[18:24] of the garden
[18:26] is
[18:45] [Music]
[18:47] the serpent was very subtle
[18:50] [Music]
[18:52] you will never see him coming
[18:55] you will see most people the servant
[18:58] they paint it as if he has a
[19:08] he's very scary
[19:10] that is not it
[19:14] looks a very good gentleman
[19:18] and even what he speaks is a word of God
[19:22] you can see he's coming preaching what
[19:25] the Lord has said to us
[19:28] and she never see him coming
[19:32] you may see one of some brothers for
[19:35] telling me I never saw this coming I
[19:37] lost my job
[19:41] I come early I never complained but
[19:46] these people they make sure I have not
[19:49] gotten this job
[19:50] okay
[19:56] he comes in a beautiful way
[19:59] he comes in a very right way
[20:02] it looks atmosphere is very right
[20:06] and you'll wake up
[20:13] [Music]
[20:14] when you are exposed is when you realize
[20:16] you are insane
[20:20] Adam never knew he was going to lose
[20:25] but he found himself in sin also
[20:27] Hallelujah
[20:31] let us read
[20:34] Genesis chapter 3
[20:37] verse 17.
[20:41] now they had made sins
[20:45] found in transgression and the Lord is
[20:48] giving them a word
[20:51] in 17 he says and unto Adam he said
[20:54] because thou had had turned unto the
[20:57] voice of thy wife and has eaten the tree
[21:01] of which I command thee saying Thou
[21:04] shalt not eat of Thee Kirsty to the
[21:07] ground for thy sake in sorrow
[21:10] shall thou eat of it all the days of
[21:13] life
[21:14] thou all the thirsty shall it bring
[21:17] forth the tree and thou shalt eat the
[21:19] herbs of the field in this weight of thy
[21:22] face shall thy eat bread till thou
[21:25] return unto the ground for out of it was
[21:27] taken from the dust Thou Art and unto
[21:31] dust thou shall return
[21:36] okay
[21:56] because
[22:02] [Music]
[22:14] I'll not take much of your time and you
[22:18] see now the Adam fall Adam and when you
[22:23] fall all the Earth that were human
[22:25] beings also were Fallen Adam
[23:26] foreign Hallelujah
[23:29] let us read
[23:31] from the book but it was not so from the
[23:35] beginning
[23:42] we read in the Bible
[23:45] that he that was sitting on the throne
[23:50] had that book
[23:53] and it was sealed inside and outside
[23:57] and there is no man in heaven
[24:02] in Earth
[24:07] or able to take the book from the hand
[24:11] of him that sit upon the throne
[24:14] no one was found worthy
[24:17] no one was found worthy
[24:19] that's why you see
[24:22] uh Daniel tried to look up the books
[24:31] no man worthy to fight to open that book
[24:35] okay
[24:39] that's why John was crying
[24:43] because in that book that is
[24:54] your
[24:58] problems
[25:06] because no one was worthless he himself
[25:11] that's why he was found in the presence
[25:13] of God and fall on the ground he know he
[25:17] was not worthy
[25:19] we thank the Lord
[25:21] amen

[27:18] Seven Seals therefore and no man in
[27:20] Heaven Nor in Earth was able to open the
[27:24] book neither to look therefore and I

[44:03] 23.

[44:15] so he sent me a message and said
[44:18] congratulations you are now a
[44:20] grandfather he said oh yeah
[44:26] I thought what we have had here tonight
[44:28] is fire the Roses
[44:33] God has said
[44:35] this gift in a new place
[44:41] if you remember
[44:43] is currently there is no pasta in
[44:46] ourselves
[44:49] and uh you know after the work there
[44:54] started
[44:57] I I left you brother Tim left
[45:02] and this was an entirely a new church
[45:05] I remember there was about the ones I
[45:08] remember that we baptized in one time or
[45:10] about 30 people
[45:12] but there were more that were baptized
[45:16] later on
[45:17] but there was you know a ship without a
[45:20] Shepherd cannot remain together
[45:22] is
[45:27] see there was a big vacuum in one room
[45:31] and brother Ephraim organized took it
[45:35] upon himself
[45:36] [Music]
[45:39] and he came to me he said
[45:43] and I hope you don't mind standing for a
[45:45] little because
[45:49] God has confirmed it to you
[46:15] one person came and spoke to him
[46:17] but I don't remember whether it was a
[46:19] prophecy or whatever
[46:21] but she spoke to him and told him I said
[46:23] how long do they give you
[46:26] two weeks they said they said after
[46:29] after he had preached the message to
[46:30] them
[46:31] they were so angry with him that they
[46:35] told him young man you were here to
[46:36] waste your life
[46:39] and they told him we have given you two
[46:42] weeks
[46:43] if you don't leave this city you are
[46:47] going to die
[46:48] how long have you been there
[46:55] amen and he was telling me I was so
[46:58] surprised when I had the testimony
[47:00] he was telling me that I think every
[47:03] week is it every week or every month
[47:05] every week he baptized like how many
[47:07] people on average like five or six
[47:09] people every week
[47:13] they have services not once a week
[47:17] two three
[47:20] it
[47:22] six days a week they have services
[47:28] for serious business
[47:31] the church did not send him there
[47:37] God sent him
[47:39] do you know what happened when he
[47:42] received the message it was like a fire
[47:45] that began to consume
[47:48] and I believe it is that that has sent
[47:51] him into that City
[47:53] and there are many people now that are
[47:55] being baptized and coming to the
[47:56] knowledge of the message
[47:59] I don't know what anybody else believes
[48:03] but here is what I believe
[48:05] God has put something in him
[48:08] that will be a great blessing to the
[48:11] country and nation of Ethiopia
[48:14] Ethiopia Hallelujah the best we can do
[48:17] is to pray for him
[48:19] then the Lord will do the rest
