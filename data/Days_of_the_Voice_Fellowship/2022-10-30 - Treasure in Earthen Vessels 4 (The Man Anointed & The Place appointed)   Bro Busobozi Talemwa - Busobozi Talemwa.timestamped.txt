[10:48] and you know we our concentration is
[10:50] still up before the sun comes
[10:55] [Music]
[10:56] foreign
[11:14] [Music]
[11:24] [Music]
[11:36] [Music]
[11:43] [Music]
[11:53] [Music]
[12:07] [Music]
[12:11] all the lights
[12:18] [Music]
[12:27] [Applause]
[12:30] [Music]
[12:40] [Music]
[12:49] [Applause]
[12:50] [Music]
[12:59] [Applause]
[13:02] amen my God is
[13:07] [Music]
[13:08] [Applause]
[13:11] [Music]
[13:12] [Applause]
[13:15] [Music]
[13:19] foreign
[13:23] [Music]
[13:33] [Music]
[13:42] [Music]
[13:53] this morning
[13:55] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[14:05] [Music]
[14:35] in Jesus
[14:42] chapter 7. foreign
[14:46] [Music]
[15:28] we are going to read a
[15:30] we'll read only one verse and then we do
[15:33] that
[15:34] to the currency
[15:39] versus 21.
[15:44] [Music]
[15:47] and they stood every man in his place
[15:50] round about the calm and all the horse
[15:52] trained and cried and fled
[15:55] foreign
[16:57] foreign
[18:12] uh keep his treasures in a vessel of
[18:16] um of of of metal or in a vessel of
[18:19] something like like aluminum or
[18:21] something like that yeah
[18:27] because his confidence is not in the
[18:30] first so where he is keeping the
[18:33] treasure
[18:36] but his confidence is in the Treasure
[18:39] itself
[18:42] so The Treasure of God is
[18:46] not the flesh your flesh The Treasure of
[18:50] God is what he has deposited
[18:53] and what he has deposited in you is the
[18:56] word of God
[18:58] of God is a light that is shining in
[19:01] your life
[19:02] and the more it shines it goes on
[19:05] growing bigger and bigger and bigger
[19:10] the more you hear but the more light
[19:14] just strikes you don't come away
[19:18] it becomes bigger and bigger
[19:22] and you know that when the light strikes
[19:26] there is one thing that happened without
[19:29] Darkness please
[19:31] Darkness and Light cannot be in the same
[19:34] place at the same time
[19:39] when when life comes Darkness please
[19:44] rather God said in the beginning
[19:52] and I want to say that when we hear the
[19:54] word of God in our life
[20:03] praise the name of the Lord
[20:05] amen so you have to get out what is out
[20:08] of me this morning by saying amen
[20:12] about me now
[20:14] you helped me preach this morning
[20:16] so we can see what the Holy Spirit has
[20:18] for us now
[20:22] whenever God sends a light Captain
[20:26] there is a man anointed to received
[20:30] there is a place
[20:36] what I'm saying is
[20:39] you have your place in the body of
[20:41] Christ
[20:45] and that blessed Rich virtue cannot be
[20:48] replaced by another woman allow you to
[20:50] cheat them you know people sometimes
[20:52] around why do we have a lot of fights
[20:55] and a lot of battles
[20:58] because people are afraid of others
[21:01] taking their presence
[21:05] will replace them
[21:08] before and that's why they keep fighting
[21:10] one another one you know you find that
[21:14] if a Man Loves a Woman
[21:16] especially in Africa here where we have
[21:19] polygamy
[21:21] you find that uh you know a man has more
[21:25] than one woman
[21:27] and you know polygamy is almost legally
[21:30] accepted in our country
[21:33] so you will find that all these women
[21:35] will be fighting
[21:38] for their place in the heart
[21:42] and in the same way even when a man is
[21:45] married
[22:00] [Music]
[22:30] [Applause]
[22:43] that he can repress me foreign
[23:45] and there is a place anointed our place
[23:48] appointed I told which
[23:50] for God to bless you he wants to bless
[23:54] you there nobody can use you so that he
[23:58] can anoint you come after and use you in
[24:00] my dreams
[24:05] praise the name of the Lord I want to
[24:07] look at verse Psalms 105 13.
[24:13] when they went from one nation to
[24:16] another from one Kingdom to another he
[24:18] suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he
[24:20] reproved the Kings for their sex saying
[24:22] that's not my anointed and do my
[24:24] prophets know how is that too
[24:29] foreign
[24:33] 105 13.
[24:35] 105 13 yes
[24:54] praise the name of the Lord anointed
[25:03] foreign
[25:44] a little bit
[25:49] I'm so glad that I can say foreign
[26:47] is Anointed
[26:49] God never wants his prophets
[26:56] amen you notice in the Bible there was a
[27:00] Man Called Moses and Moses had given one
[27:03] of the laws
[27:04] no Israelite was supposed to marry out
[27:07] of Israelites
[27:11] Moses went and married an Ethiopian
[27:17] and he was supposed to be the prophet of
[27:19] God
[27:21] and when his sister and the other
[27:24] prophets and other brothers
[27:28] oh God
[27:30] he said who are you to do that how come
[27:34] you do that and and
[27:37] you know the sister of Moses became sick
[27:41] and and and you know they could not get
[27:44] any remedies
[27:47] unless the man of God prayed
[27:50] and we've seen that over and over
[27:53] you know even at one place one of the
[27:55] men of God lied
[27:58] and you know this man took the woman in
[28:01] his in the Integrity of his heart
[28:02] without knowing what happened
[28:08] he was going to kill the kids he said
[28:12] how can you take the wife of my Prophet
[28:17] how dare you do that and he said now
[28:20] restore the man his wife
[28:24] and we find it over and over in
[28:27] scripture
[28:30] Elisha was walking on the road
[28:33] you know these little children who were
[28:35] not taught well by their parents
[28:38] and they came scorning and laughing
[28:42] maybe they were laughing at his boat
[28:46] children can be on the villages
[28:57] come on and when he saw them
[29:08] that was not right
[29:12] why because he was a man anointed
[29:16] and he was in his right place
[29:19] let me tell you if you were a child of
[29:21] God
[30:29] you know you know he was signing all
[30:31] these papers which were declaring him as
[30:33] a king and giving middle authorities
[30:36] but maybe he was frustrated
[30:41] you know he was just on the table Yeah
[30:44] he was you know signaling some of his
[30:46] people to come on the creek
[30:53] so these people went on the news
[30:57] they put it all over
[30:59] you know you know I think is this I
[31:02] think
[31:03] I mean this is a human being
[31:06] because he is
[31:35] on yourself
[31:50] foreign
[32:50] sometimes you can even reach a moment
[32:52] yeah
[32:53] the Son of God when you are not going to
[32:57] pray but you just think
[33:00] and things will happen
[33:03] amen
[33:07] it's in your mind
[33:14] we need to recognize our places
[33:36] then you come to that realization
[33:39] that God is not going to give you
[33:42] breakthroughs because of your abilities
[33:52] and and really this subject that I'm
[33:54] speaking on is something about our day
[33:57] today living um
[34:03] defeated lives because of what we think
[34:05] of ourselves
[34:11] you know you always think law of
[34:14] yourself because
[34:15] people can't even stop God because they
[34:18] think a lot of themselves
[34:34] and let us follow this thought through
[34:36] category
[34:37] let us look at uh Judges 7 1.
[34:56] of Herod
[34:58] so that the horse of the midianites were
[35:00] on the north side of them by the hill of
[35:02] Murray in the valley and the Lord said
[35:04] unto Gideon the people that are with
[35:06] thee are two family for me to give the
[35:09] midianites into their hands lest Israel
[35:11] want themselves against me saying mine
[35:13] owner understand and accept me
[35:16] Nicola
[35:59] maybe it wasn't the place appointed
[36:02] Charlie she said and they were not yet
[36:05] anointed
[36:06] so here Israel
[36:09] is rifling at the hand of the midianites
[36:11] for years
[36:15] and the end of the Lord came one day and
[36:17] he said
[36:36] let me tell you sometimes God
[36:50] but sometimes it doesn't get to do it
[36:54] cause of the place where we are already
[36:58] poetry
[36:59] because if he does it at that place
[37:02] you will think it was your own strength
[37:06] you will think it was your own energy
[37:10] it was your ability
[37:12] and now God blesses you in a place
[37:20] it is at the place of weakness
[37:26] that God wants to anoint that much
[37:35] raise the name of the Lord and so we see
[37:39] here that these people 32 everyone
[37:41] around the Middle East were always
[37:43] fighting against us
[38:28] they are very many
[38:31] actually there were 22 000 people
[38:35] he said God these people are so many
[38:38] countries
[38:40] for me to give the immediates into their
[38:42] house
[38:51] the moment you think
[38:55] that you were so holy
[39:02] foreign
[39:10] the moment you think we can throw the
[39:12] words you are so rich
[39:15] God Will Make sure
[39:17] you do not attain your goals
[39:21] the moment you think we cast all the
[39:24] words you have accumulated a lot of
[39:26] wisdom and knowledge
[39:32] and if you read this Bible very well it
[39:35] has happened over and over again
[39:40] God always confounds the wisdom of the
[39:43] wives
[39:46] am I preaching to someone
[39:49] God always confounds the wisdom of the
[39:52] world
[39:53] and here he told Gideon thank you for
[39:57] the amen those people sought for two
[40:00] minutes
[40:04] God is not in big crowds
[40:10] have you ever thought about that
[40:13] God is never in a big problem
[40:21] wait a moment those five thousand were
[40:25] there for as long as they prayed and the
[40:27] fish was dead
[40:32] but even when the fish and the bread was
[40:35] there now you want the middle name they
[40:38] could not stand the word
[40:40] when Jesus began to open the Scrolls yes
[40:44] we are single room is single they said
[40:47] these things are so hard for us
[40:49] how can he tell us
[40:59] and the Bible says the end shall not
[41:02] come until there is a falling away fast
[41:09] so don't fear if you hear some who said
[41:12] they have left a message
[41:16] that has to happen foreign
[42:03] [Applause]
[43:07] hallelujah amen those who hate me they
[43:10] go again and those who love me
[43:12] and they don't love me because they love
[43:14] me but I love me because they love the
[43:15] world
[43:19] those are the ones
[43:21] amen and every Pastor that preaches the
[43:24] word
[43:26] that conviction
[43:29] you know you don't want people to love
[43:31] you because you're a superstar
[43:36] foreign
[44:11] Jesus yes remained only with a few yes
[44:19] one of them was still uh
[44:22] the Devil Himself
[44:27] Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[44:30] where he is today there will be a repeat
[44:33] of this
[44:38] your arm is so big
[44:41] please
[44:43] let me tell you we don't cut down our
[44:46] army by chasing our people
[44:48] um
[44:52] by giving people wrong and bad attitude
[44:58] foreign
[45:20] let him return and depart Ali from the
[45:23] ma from Mount Gilead and their returned
[45:26] of the people 20 and 2000 and there
[45:28] remain ten thousand
[45:30] foreign
[45:38] [Music]
[45:54] that's why you sit in churches
[45:59] every Church
[46:05] but people will keep coming whatever and
[46:09] people will keep going again and then
[46:11] you ask yourself who chased them
[46:13] and who kept those ones who stayed
[46:18] at any time
[46:23] I think we have something wrong people
[46:26] who love to do that
[46:29] you know make you know puts them in that
[46:32] kind of uh spiral
[46:36] oh I think there's something wrong
[46:39] you know maybe our music has a problem
[46:42] maybe what we are preaching
[46:47] let me tell you these things could all
[46:49] be true
[46:50] but the true seed of God
[46:53] will always
[46:57] true
[47:04] is this in where
[47:17] that is being preached
[47:21] and here 22 000 people left again
[47:27] and over the years that I've been
[47:29] preaching this message
[47:35] but I've noticed that and you know God
[47:39] has also allowed me to be in the
[47:41] beginning assemblies
[47:45] I've never in all my life uh uh been or
[47:50] attended uh a mega church
[47:55] I've preached to some of them
[47:57] but on occasions all my life I've dealt
[48:02] with small groups
[48:08] but you know you watch a church grow
[48:10] from 50 people
[48:16] by the time you get 10 people
[48:19] you have in and out you have had about
[48:22] 50 people
[48:25] um
[48:27] and all those take a piece of your life
[48:31] as a minister
[48:35] you pray with each of them preach to
[48:39] them you pray with them
[48:42] and only for them to leave again
[48:47] foreign
[48:57] foreign
[49:21] [Music]
[49:46] hallelujah amen there is always a chance
[49:48] until the chance is not there voila what
[49:51] did you say
[49:52] wow let me tell you that the very last
[49:56] person that was saved when Jesus was on
[49:58] earth
[50:00] oh I should say the very first one
[50:03] when Jesus died on the cross yesterday
[50:05] he died on the very last minute it was
[50:09] seven in the last of the last minute
[50:12] imagine there were many people who were
[50:15] in Paradise for years and years and
[50:17] years
[50:23] and they were all waiting foreign
[50:44] my brother died with Jesus foreign
[51:31] what if he was sad
[51:34] I don't even want to preach anymore
[51:39] how can the father let me suffer like
[51:42] this
[51:43] how can I go through this because
[51:49] I'm hungry
[51:51] that Soul would have been lost
[51:55] even at that better moment let me just
[51:58] said hey true these were two thieves
[52:03] that one of them um
[52:07] [Music]
[52:09] save yourself
[52:17] so they're all the same
[52:20] you're all going to be is
[52:24] you never say that there you'll get it
[52:26] but Jesus
[52:31] he was full of grace
[52:36] and full of Truth
[52:40] oh Hallelujah some Believers are so full
[52:43] of truth that they have no Grace at all
[52:46] right
[52:52] okay
[52:54] Jesus was full of grace and truth
[52:59] he saw this man I did not comments
[53:04] because Jesus was full of grace
[53:08] this man was touched
[53:12] and he said to the other man
[53:23] like that about the man who has died for
[53:27] no reason foreign
[53:35] at least for us we have done what we
[53:37] have been killed for what could it says
[53:41] [Applause]
[53:46] my Lord when you die
[53:49] and you get there please
[53:57] there are many Souls
[53:59] what God remembers

[55:20] approach to this message

[55:32] they are better than others
[56:04] into the kingdom of God
[56:08] hahaha
[56:21] Gideon okay you had so much

[1:49:48] you know people give money to the church
[1:49:50] and they don't know where it went away
[1:49:58] when you give to God
[1:50:00] understood you give to God

[1:50:19] shall give accountability the next
