The great creator, the Lord Jesus who paid the debt, the unfailing God, the God of all ages, the ancient of days. You inhabit the praises of your people. And today now we give you the glory. We give you the honor, the praises as we surrender all to you father in the mighty name of our Amen. Amen. Amen. [Applause] Amen. Amen. God richer bless you. Thank you for coming to church and um the zeal of the Lord The Bible says that the zeal of the Lord performed it. Please come and help us. the whole night the song leading and leading us into prayer. So he has a lot to do here. Yes. So he will find us. Uh God richer bless you and uh we appreciate the Lord for this hour this moment that he has granted us. While you are still standing uh let us read the scripture. Uh the Bible says in the book of Ezekiel chapter 47 verse 2-12 no no no verse 2-5 Ezekiel 47 verse 2-5 it says then he brought he me out of the way of the gate northward what just say Then he brought me out of the way of the gate northward, and he led me about the way without unto the utter gate. I will read. Then he brought me then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate, by the way that lookth that lookth eastward, and behold, there out waters on the right side. And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured he measured he measured a thousand chubits and he brought me through the waters. The waters were to the ankles. Again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters. The waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand and brought me through. The waters were to the loins. Afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over. For the waters were risen, waters to swim in and river that could not be passed over. Amen. Amen. [Music] [Music] of forch. No. God add a blessing to the may take your seats. Amen. Amen. Uh what I want to talk about today is not a new thing and uh don't sleep. I won't take long. I was given one and a half to two hours but I I will use not more than one and a half. I want to use like one hour maybe 10 minutes. Amen. Amen. Um um you know uh often times when we come to the house of God as we have sung that song ancient words ever true changing me and changing you. We have come with open heart. Let the ancient words of God impart. While the preacher is preaching and the word is going for, the Holy Spirit catches that word and reveals it to you. He catches that word and gives it life and comes to your heart. He puts the life of the word. Because if he gives you that word, Without the Holy Spirit, we won't get to the light. So our prayer is always Lord take the word as we preach. We have the mechanics add the dynamics. Give it life before your people their lives. He hatches and breathes over you and he changes you. Ever true ancient words, they are old words but they are ever true, ever alive. See brothers and sisters, the inspiration of the Lord, you know when I wrote this message, when I wrote it, then we came to the overnight and brother Martin read the scripture and he started to preach man. He was finishing it. I said God you moved and gave me a message then you moved and gave brother he's finishing it so I could say amen hallelujah but God diverted leave something because I say I'll preach it but it is I said divert him a bit does not [Music] enter and uh but God could not divert but uh who can recall the the subject Now this Syria who can recall the subject will last overnight his message. Yes to church. Ah my God. Brother Martin is around. Perhaps he can remind us the subject. I won't tell you to. Yes. The jubilee. Yes. The year of jubilee. That's God bless you. Amen. But I have another approach and not of jubilee but some things which were part of what he had preached also. God had given me the same thing some time back. So I could try to leave it but God you could say give this yes I want to talk about there is no summit to God's power there is no summit to God's power reached the hilltop of [Music] There's no more can go up. There's no summit to God's plan. We were coming with brother Shem today at night and I looked outside. No, I saw cows. You know they tie them their horns with ropes and up on the bars of the art roll. The cow has to be just be like this till it gets where they going. I felt pity for the cow because it was really really terrible thing. Then I thought Can you imagine that? Same thing happens to people. The devil gets them, ties them well, and he takes them. They can't shake. They can't move. Just like an animal. Just like an animal. That's why the prophet say a man without the holy spirit is worse than a beast you may not say see that if you have never been in the world brethren I tell you you can be worse I was like worse than a beast I said what is saying is very True. He can do wickedly than what a beast can do. But we thank God that the power of God which is unlimited can defeat the power of God and can set such free. It cannot be explained. It can't be explained. Starting it off from this point, brothers and sisters, brethren, often times the brethren take a hold of something good, something good and real. And it is true. And they always want to conclude that this is all of it. when it's not so sometimes the people get onto one side and no problem said in a message Hebrews watch the people when they believe if they are learn educated If you don't watch and you are not watchful in prayer, they become radicals, hard rough, hard to deal with. And if they are and they are not well taught in the word they will become fanatic. He said the way is in the middle. So sometimes the people get on to one side and they say This is the approach to God's word. Anything out of this is wrong. And they set an unscriptural boundary. But there is diverse approaches. [Music] diverse approaches to God's word, the same spirit of God is a God of diversity and God is a God of sometimes the people will say it ought to come from us from our group or else it is wrong. Lord, we saw someone casting out a devil in your name, but he's not one of Should we stop him? He said, "No. Anyone who is not against us is for us. The people put limitations and they end up with a denominational mindset. They end up with a denominational mindset but sitting under a true church. Can you imagine sitting where the true word of God is preached but because you have made up your mind in some other [Music] way make for yourself a denominational mind then the true word will not have any impact on people living in the unchanged lives. It's okay not to be changed today. But there has to be a change somewhere. It doesn't have to come from you. It has to come from the Lord by the word that you listen to. It comes to a point that it comes to a point that the people pray but the way they approach God the prayer does not break through it's the mindset yes the mindset or you approach to God. Yes, we say you are free but your mind is bound yet free. You don't know how to approach him and how to respond after him, how to act after prayer. to do after prayer then you don't get the [Music] answer brothers and sisters what I'm saying is this don't put limitations to God how you know him how things ought to come has to come from us this one it has to come from me it has to come from so and so. It doesn't have to come from you. It doesn't have to come from me. It doesn't have to come from anybody. It has to come from God. We are Bible believers. Let us act like Bible believer. We are Bible believers. We speak where the Bible speaks. We keep quiet where the Bible is quiet. The prophet says that is the bride. That is the bride. Speaks where the Bible speaks and is silent where the Bible. If God said so, that settles it. We have an unlimited God with unlimited power. You cannot you cannot you cannot put God in a circle. And he said that's where he is ought to be. It's a crime for you to reduce God. A man made idea. Don't define God by your definition. No, you will not be able to get from him. When you define him by your definition, you will become a limited God because your mind is limited. The word is what defines God. It is the absolute definition. who God is. The Bible says God is in the Catholic church. The Anglican church says God is in the Anglican church. The Muslim says God is in the church. But God is in his word. And that's what defines God. And what proves that is in his word. is the evidence of the result. We must have facts of our faith of our faith which is the result of what we believe. cannot let go of the We cannot let go of Christianity. It's the life that we have tested and seen and known and it can't be taken [Music] away in the message hidden life. He was talking about a hidden life with the Christ. life that in Christ. I loved the message. I am but a man. But not just a man, a man under a divine. just a man with a human element but because of the divine assignment I live a divine life. No no no not yet I not I not I but Christ that liveth. He says in the message hidden life. And now when the brethren received the baptism, they said, "This is the summit. This is all of it." But that's wrong. See, there is no summit to God's power. We move on and on. It's the unlimited resources of God has never been tapped yet. blessings and power that we know nothing about. It has never been even revealed to arch angels. It's laying just ahead for his church that will believe for his church that will believe. It's not that there isn't anymore. It's because your faith has come to an end. There is more. If you can let loose, let loose. Why do you fear release your faith? For eye has not seen, ear has not heard, neither has it entered the hearts of men. What God has for them is that love him. The love of God constrains us to believe God. So let us move up and claim our rights as God opens the gates. He says when you move, God opens, you move, he opens the move, he opens the swings out the welcome m. Welcome my daughter. Welcome my son. I have waited for so long for you to get to this system. You have it is you that was supposed to come [Applause] here. He said John, have you seen the seven church ages things that will be through the ages? That's wonderful. But come up higher. Come up higher. I show you things that shall be here. What I've known, I thought what John knew about the church is okay. God says, uh, I want to show you also things that shall be [Music] here, but first come up here. Let us move up into deeper depth and never colonize ourselves and organize ourselves and to get to a place where we believe this and that's all. He says don't get to that. Yes, I believe this. I believe that's all. He says, "Let us believe this." He said, "What you believe is all right. Let us believe this. Plus, how much more we can hear from God. Let us believe this. Plus, how much more we can hear from God. You know something, but hear something else from God. The problem is you know something but you want to what what you want to plus you are not hearing it from God. You are hearing it from a false shepherd shepherds outside the message. That's what you want to add on the message. You want the message plus a denominational teaching message plus the word the message plus my mindset plus what you can hear from God. I think that ought to be the ne the motive of every man. and woman that loves the Lord Jesus to receive all that you can to receive all that you can say according to the power that works in us because the grace he said is different to every [Music] man. But what you can receive from the Lord, receive it from the hand of his bountful mercy. That's my heart. That's the reason I never joined any organization or took sides with any group. The prophet says take sides with Jesus because I wanted myself wide open for the love of God for what he could give. Every time you choose to group yourself outside the word of God, you are closing the door to God's love. You are closing the door to God's. Remember this and don't forget it. God, you don't have to ask God to come in your group. It's you to come out of your and come to God. There is no summit to God's power. It's you that has come to the summit. You should think and feels that you have come to the hilltop. Brethren, this God that we are serving is the God that rules in nature. He rules nature. He rules in the affairs of men. He rises the sun. He wakes it up and he sets the sun and he hides it from one place and shining in another place. What a mighty God we see. He reigns rain in one place, closes the heavens in one place. One time I read a scripture in Isaiah which says it speaks to the clouds through the thunder to release the rain. I said I didn't know You're going to hear the thundering. It's the voice of God. You may not believe it, but I believe it. He holds the orbits of the earth. Could you imagine? We can lift you upside down but the soul will not pour out the soul within. Could you imagine the doctor can cut you the soul will not come. But let God Call that soul out that body remain on that. Who can define for me such a God? Who can bring for me a God greater than all God? Who can tell me that this God can't do anything? Abraham, is anything too hard for the Lord? Child of God, have no fear. There's a song we sing. I won't be shaken. I won't be more. My God is faithful. My God is able. Greater than you. He holds your soul within. [Music] It cannot escape. David said, "You have surrounded me with the bones." Meaning was on the inside surrounded with the bones. And he said, "You have given me this body as a house of my priv. I am just in this border. But one day, someday God only knows just the wheels of mortal life shall all stand still to dwell on Zion's hill. I will see him outside. I'll see him. I will see him. I'll see him who saved my soul. I'll see him. The bones won't hold my soul. My body won't hold my soul, but I'll see my God. Some glad morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Tell me which kind of people that have the hope that a Christian has they can speak but they know in the heart they don't have that. Maybe you are here in the church. You talk about it, but you know you don't have it. You don't have to be that way. You can have it today. You can have it. His power is unlimited. And I believe God every level you get to with God, it becomes the beginning of a new [Music] beginning. Do you think you feel you have come to a certain level? It's a beginning of another. Our prophet preached a message. The power of God and he said the power of Satan is limited. The power of God is unlimited. I believe God. Do you want to be well? Is your soul troubled? Is your spiritual life dying? Are you stagnant? Spiritual stagnant economically stagnant mater. No matter your case, we all want to be well. Everyone wants to be well. We want to be better than who we are today. There's no person, no person sinner or saint that comes to church without a problem. No sir, whether they believe God and they are real Christians, whether they are make believers, whether they are unbelievers, whoever comes to church has a problem. The difference is some get the answer of the problem and don't get the God who solve the problem. Others get the answer and get God. Others don't get the answer. Everyone gets the answer. All their problem remains and they get God. Now it is impossible for someone that has got for their problem to remain. Amen. That's why I don't believe when you say someone is doing well spiritually. But physically they won't do well. How can it be? [Music] Spiritually spiritually it means you are you are well with the Bible. This is a spiritual word and addresses physical things. I'm not afraid when I get my life. Let me leave that now for now. In the message, the angel of the Lord, he says, now look, the angel of God, he says, now look, we are all here. We want to be well. And the more deeper He gives the solution. The more deeper you get into this, the better off you are going to be. Amen. The more deeper you get into this, the better off you are going to unlimited resources. If you need capital for your business, God has a resource for capital. If you need material for making your clothes to for making clothes to put on or to sell. God has a resource to supply that. If you need money for missionary work, there is a resource to provide for that because God when he set his children upon he put resources for them to do everything to meet the divine duty. I love that. It all comes supernaturally from a supernatural God to a supernatural. When you go to supernatural person and everything you receive from you receive it supernaturally. I believe in being helped and helping others but not in begging. I don't believe in that. I believe that God can send you destiny helpers. He won't change the destiny. It is already set. But he will send destiny help to get you to the destiny. I believe in that [Music] also. But I do not believe that you should accept that you are defeated. You become a beggar. There was a little child during the day of brother. The little lad was blind. She was a girl. She was blind. She came to the meeting of brother. But that time brother the people were too many. Everyone wanted to get there for too many. Everyone wanted to get to but they wanted him to get some rest. So he had to go through the people. He had to go through the people. As he was going through, going through disguising himself, disguising himself, he had a voice. He was attracted by a certain voice of a little child. She cried, "My daddy, my daddy. Where's my daddy? I can't find and babe then he came he came he came so she said my daddy where's my daddy and he looked at the girl she was blind he realized she was blind he said, "Little little child, what have you come here for in this great multitude?" She said, "I've come to see the healer." A little child. Hallelujah. Can you get me to the healer? Are you the healer? He said, "What? What have you come for? I've come to see the healer. Amen. He said, "Did you believe such things like that?" Said, "Yes, I believe." Amen. Was defeated. She said, "Sir, if you can, do you know where the hill is? If you can only get me today, I will find my daddy." Amen. Then Jesus said, "I've not seen such a faith in Israel. Such a faith. If you can only get me to the healer, I will find my dad. In other words, if you get me to the healer, I'll get my sight. Hallelujah. You won't have to look for my dad. You won't have to look for for my dad. I will seek for him. You can only get me and he just lifts my step and take me to give me the foundation. Trust me, I will build and build and put the rooftop. and enter. What a believer needs is a helping hand that can take them and put them where they want to get what they want. You will get it for yourself once you reach. Hallelujah. A believer is not someone that you help. You reach an extent and you reach an extent and really you are defeated. Things have beaten you. You can't no more support this posture and they hate you. That's not what a believer will do. A believer understands that you a man you can fail but their faith is in God. The believer the far you have took them the far where you took them and you reached the end. No, trust me. They are able to get to their dream able to achieve their when I was in my senior six. I finished my own level. I could not I reached I went to A level. I did senior five. Everything was messed up. at home and things failed. Poverty struck to the to the least and my father became very poor. There I fell. It was so unbelievable. But that was the only way God could pull me to because I cried. I reached the end. I tried started prayer and fast. One day they sent me to a certain woman's home. Be humble. My uncle sent me and get that home. I brought it with that aunt. Give you that ch because we went together. I brought also So you go and get some, bring home. When I went there, I got the charco as she I packed. I got the charcoal with my free hands. I packed I packed and greeted everyone. I didn't ask for water. I just brought my check, started going, said, "Oh, no, no, no, no. I've not given him water and please give him water. And by the way, why are you home? And I started say she said, "Oh, let me see what I can do." And she called. She first gave me about 250. The 50 use it for yourself. But that money was the data. So I paid I live there a few days. They ch I got a full I got a full bus from nowhere. And at school they thought I'm executive you know because when they give notes I just give they take she takes she gives they said ah rich child but I was just a prophet It was just God. Towards the exams, the final exam problems, she had many children take care of. She told me I cannot pay money for your tried to call the family member. They gather. I thought, man, I'm stuck now. back to the hall. So I said, "What can I do?" Somehow I didn't get hungry. I was thankful what she did and I got the money I paid off. She told me, "I have reached the end there. Someone else will take you from there and take you to an institution and take you to an institute. Now I did believe that I didn't like it because I didn't want an institute. I went to the university. But what she said is what happened. I got someone and I was able to go and I went to an institute and did a diploma. So what am I saying? Get a believer somewhere. They will be able to reach the goal. They won't be angry. We have unlimited grace, unlimited love in God. It goes far deeper, deeper beyond what unlimited inspiration. It goes far deeper to the deep things of God. A man can be so inspired till he speaks the very mind. The Bible says in second Peter 1:21 there is no scripture that is of private interpretation. that holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They were so inspired till what they spoke became the scripture. Brother, sister, you can be so inspired, when you speak the word, it becomes the scripture. Amen. There is a spirit in a man. The Bible says there is a spirit in a man and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding. God comes and inspires the spirit in the mind and gives you understanding of the word. That's what brings the Christ in the kingdom of darkness. That's what brings a crisis in the kingdom of darkness. Brothers and sisters um you cannot put a summit God's power. It goes on and on limited revelation. Brothers and sisters, many have preached this since the world began, but it is still not yet done. Amen. Could you imagine they have breached this little book since the ages [Music] become but it is not yet done? What manner of book is this? The unlimited word of God. The more they preach it, the more it expands. It becomes a new book. That's why you can get a sermon from a sermon and another preacher get a sermon out of that and another and another limited revelation. Preach the word. It will increase hearts of the people. We don't have to say too much. The little we say God expanded in your life. Brother says the Bible became a new book. When the seals were open even before the seals were open, what he preached was true. The longer you study the Bible, the deeper it gets. You can never exhaust it. It's you that has got exhausted. Well, I've read your Genesis all through. Go back and read again. You will see as if you didn't read. Something new comes up yet not new, but it was there. But it says, "I have still a lot of things to tell you, I still have a lot to do, but you can't bear them all. It don't need editing. The scripture doesn't need editing or a new other Bible." No, this old one, it still works. Unlimited anointing, a man can be so anointed till we speak things into existence. Amen. A man can be so speak what is in your heart. A man can be so anointed until the anointing breaks the lawed revival at Pentecost. It was a revival. If I go back in the days of Moses, there was a revival. God wasn't limited. And at Pentecost, he said, "I'll pour out my spirit. It was a revival. But God didn't stop there. It was a revival. But God didn't stop there. At Welsh, there was a Welsh revival. But God didn't stop. He added another revival. The layman is revival. The layman is revival. And revival. Another revival. another now. If you need another one, if you need, it's getting on. It's going on. Just get on board. The revival is on of the end time message because the end time message end time conditions. Hallelujah. When the enemy rises against us like a flood shall raise his hand against the enemy the end time message and the end time messenger of the end time message end conditions and defeat the end time conditions standard that is unlimited to a believer. It is the power that is unlimited to a believer. It is God that's unlimited. This message is like a wild fire. It's like a wild fire is burning within my heart. It sets off and it burns up all over. But when it burns, it cannot leave the chaff in you. Amen. This is the fire of God that can cleans it. The call of fire. When the call of fire touched the prophet, it made him pure as pure can be a friend. May the callers of fire of the word of God within your heart. It's all over me. It's all over me and it is keeping me up. It's the word of God. It is the spirit of God that keeps the believer alive in the service of God. We have unlimited intelligence. Unlimited intelligence that can discern the secrets of the heart. You will not be like the prophet but by the pro by the by by the inspiration of You know that the preacher spoke my life. The search engine when God came to brother pron you think it is you who designs the secrets of the heart. It is me the pillar of fire. The spirit of God is our intelligence. We have unlimited wisdom. Trust in the Lord. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on him. Man's wisdom comes to an end. Science science is limited. AI is limited. Artificial intelligence. Science is artificial. Science have a supernatural intelligence. A combination, a combination of men's thoughts is artificial intelligence. And where they end, that's where God starts. Man's wisdom has always failed and it will fail because it is limited. In your trouble, don't use your wisdom. Let me apply. Let me apply the word of God. Brother, sister, you have tried. You have tried did your efforts and things have failed to work. Let me also try by the word and we see whether they won't work. yours failed. If you tried your tricks up here and there right past well, but you have failed to get through. Allow me to take what and say you will make it. You will get through it. You will get there. A man, a man in his senses is limited to his senses. But a man in his spirit is unlimited. The spirit of the last day. Science. Science has drove man into the spirit of the last science. robots change man into a woman. The spirit of the last day and it is the wisdom of men that has driven them to the judgment of God then it won't work. But we are trying our best by God's grace to drive his children of God to drive the children of God into the last day promise to the church. But something seems to hinder. Nevertheless, we are bound to break through unlimited signs and wonders. If he did them yesterday, he does them today and tomorrow and forever. God can do a miracle today. Amen. And he can do it again tomorrow. and do it the next day and the next day and daily in your life. He can do that. All my life, it has been God. All your life, it has been God with the finger of God. We cast out devils. Are you tormented by devils? It doesn't take too much to cast them all out. Jesus said, "If I by the finger of God, just a finger casting out devils. It doesn't take too much to cast out devils. It takes man and woman fully surrendered to God brother sister in my name s will cast out devils man that's fully surrender to God is unlimited get him into a crisis destroy all that he will still Say, "I know my redeemer." You mock him. You slap him. Step on his toe. You slay him. He will say, "Father, forgive them. Put him in prison. He will worship and praise him." Why? He is living above the world. He is eternal. He is unlimited. Put him in the grave. You will rise again. He is unlimited. Unlimited faith. You can speak what you desire into existence. You are only controlled by a principle. No. No. Amen. You are controlled by the principle that faith works by love. If you have love, you have confidence with God. If you have confidence with God, then you can have faith. Speak your desire. For we know that he gives us whatever we ask of him because we ask according to his will looking at the unseen. The prophet says, I was told out here at Bastofield, I believe is what they call it where they have these big jet planes that the jet plane in its travel it goes to a certain speed and then it hits what's called the sound barrier. It it hits what is called sound par. And they say that that plane struggles and shakes while it is trying to get through that sound barrier. It is seem like the wings will tear off of it and the boats will rip out of it while it is going through that [Music] sound. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But when once it gets beyond the sound then it's speed is unlimited. It can just fly free and the church and you sitting here tonight. Tonight Oh, you are struggling. This is the prophet. He says and the church you sitting here tonight. Oh, you are struggling. You are struggling and struggling and God is pulling to you and showing you things. If you can ever get past that sin barrier of unbelief, then unlimited revival will break out through the United States through DVF and FAV. If you can go beyond that sound barrier, sound barrier of unbelief. You say, "Oh, is it true? Does it mean me? Could I be healed? Could I be saved? Could I be filled with the Holy Spirit? Get beyond that. How can I break through? How can I be a weapon through? How can me be someone can use for someone? He says just keep struggling, struggling and struggling until you break through and the Holy Ghost comes upon you. I am telling you, you are beyond it and there is 50 miles of room unlimited glory. Heaven and earth can't contain it. That's the glory of our God. And we come down in the temple of Solomon.
