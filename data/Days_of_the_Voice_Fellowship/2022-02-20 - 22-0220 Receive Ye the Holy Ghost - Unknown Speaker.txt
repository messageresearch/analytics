in her neck which had everything inside [Music] um and so they usually the police when we went to the police they say that usually they hit you on the head brother brother uh Joel song reading this morning we have younger men coming up not only in song it's just one of them God is doing something you know when you see young men raising to the challenge of the ministry then you know they are feeding on the world I think this is the most important thing you can ever do in this life all the rest is not important some people think that in heaven it shall all be the same time we shall be the same in the sense that we shall all be redeemed but we shall not be the same in the sense that our Glory will be different foreign [Music] [Music] sometimes we say oh yeah Christ has been judged for us we will not be judged is true it is true in the sense that we shall not go in the word front judgments because the words is a place where decision is made whether or not you get eternal life but for the children of God we have already got eternal life by receiving Jesus Christ and by receiving the Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ gives us eternal life we are not going to walk in that judgment where we shall where decision will have to be made whether or not to get eternal life because for us to walk into the Judgment seat of Christ [Music] foreign [Music] eternity [Music] the glory that we have received by doing what we have done for the Lord praise the name of the Lord oh my that was just a bonus so let us go into our sharing for this morning and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghosts I was you know after overnight and we went to look at uh to to help Sister Rose and then I did have enough time to rest or to study but but um so last night again I did not rest because I was waiting upon the Lord this is um not because a minister does not usually have what to talk about there is a lot in this Bible Bible verse about it but you see it is not that way those of you who Minister know what I'm talking about you know you have to wait on the Lord to receive his mind about what the people need to change when you come to church the future will preach sometimes about what you've been thinking about him he will preach about what you've been praying about now you can preach about what you have been reading in the Bible because God knew that is what you needed and then he gives inspiration to the preacher and the preacher Taps into that anointing to be able to provide your needs that's right before you come to church that's why you need to pray we need to be in prayer for the minister for the ministry of the world but you can ask the Lord to give you so why do you pray oh Lord give me today my daily bread at that very moment the holy spirit is also giving inspiration to the priests foreign [Music] and so I'm not going to get done with this today this is just the beginning of this subjects it's a big subject that we can talk about and my desire is that after we have we have we are done with it I don't know how many times how many services we shall deal with it but my desire is that each of you in this church will receive the holy ghosts amen Amina we don't want to have a church of people who are going to hell yeah you want to have a church are you sure don't miss any of these meetings as we speak on receiving the Holy Ghost because you need to receive the Holy Ghost I'm happy to see sister Agnes and husbands um they're members of this Fellowship who don't usually attend because they live far but we are claiming them for the Lord to bring them closer amen Amina praise the name of the Lord come here I said praise the name of the Lord receive ye the Holy Ghost and now this was at the time that Jesus had risen from the dead and you remember we had a subject we spoke about the reason why he came Network do you remember why he came why did he come right here why did he come right cheers he came from Glory yeah he came down today but why did he come now why did Jesus yes [Music] to serve the Lord to redeem the bride but we we had the full subject on this summer please go back to it the reason why you know the Bible says so for God so loved the world and I want to speak for one hour so that I I I make sure that you get everything I'm talking about Hallelujah amen I mean so I hope it will remind me so when Jesus came yesterday the Bible says that he is only because is that right is that right that's what the Bible says all of them that is a special group of people worldwide that are not just believersible they are fully a part of Jesus you know there are many people who believe in Jesus and they go to church not all of them who believe in Jesus there are many people who love me as many people that I love my children my mother my sister but they're all not a part of me only one person is Jesus will be the only one to receive the true genuine holy ghosts because she will be a part of Jesus she will not just be a church I will not be a denomination but it will be a part of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ in my traveling I have found one who is a part of them and that one is right here have you ever found one who is a part of the body of Jesus today who has ever found one raise up your hands all right I see two hands three hands except all of you the rest don't know you have never found that one but I tell you yeah I found it I realize I'm a part of the body of Jesus [Music] a body of Jesus Christ [Music] now the reason why Jesus came was to die on the cross Adam Adam and everything Adam lost him so that he can redeem the rest of Adam what was the race of Adam she was the image of God of God that was lost Jesus came to die on the cross yes and why did he die on the cross died because of his love for us that we may be redeemed back to our Originals are you following me now well if you're following may I expect you to say Amen hallelujah amen in which image was Adam Adam was in the image of God in which image financially foreign was an image of Japan it means he was also in the image of God but that's not true remember the image of Adam that because he was already a fallen image charity family good day he was a fallen Adam were a good day who needed Redemption MMA and every body that came out of the loins of Adam in every moon was Fallen because that was the gene that they came with but there were other children who were able to come out of uh of Eve and that we seeking and also Cain had Islamic okay and they were also born in the Fallen image of Adam that was the lineage of the serpenter do we have Believers in this church this morning that was the lineage of the serpenter we have two lineages on Earth is the lineage of the serpents and another is the lineage of Adam hallelujah amen ities [Music] [Music] because the gene of amen one from that same rest that was not falling like that like Adam but having the same genes having the same original DNA Garden hallelujah amen in order to replace I will prove this to you by them that Eve had two children foreign [Music] Kane is not there in Italian they begin from set but says do you know why they begin from said because when Cain killed Abel yet to happen hallelujah amen you know then the Bible says given me another seed cut through them birthday and seeking that I'm listening carefully God has given me another scene instead oh much was not another seeds was of the same seed yet he wants he was of the 70s how do we know DNA too much we can only be able to find DNA following after the bloodline of the father hallelujah amen and so we are able to know it's not that the DNA obsessed with the same DNA with Abel says and people are confused they don't know what happened between animals They Came From Evolution [Music] hallelujah amen and he said foreign that is why today you have people baby that is why today we have people who are who are terrorists it's as if they don't have stools you even wonder is it really that God who is the one who created these ones whatever for you they don't care if the Bible says and then they laugh [Music] and he came back to church what have you done where's your brother am I My Brother's Keeper seed hallelujah amen God himself came and preached to him but he cannot believe hallelujah hallelujah now I can't that see the language I'm just making an introduction for today exactly after one hour I'll just stop hallelujah amen listen put it up that's hidden lineage of Caine it doesn't matter how good or bad they are they do what they want they don't mind about the word of God in your mind about their feelings and what they want they're like foreign they just go and buy women off the streets and they don't even feel anything in their hearts what is it there is no seed inside there is and this kind can never receive the Holy Quran but the true seed of God Amen it is born in the same way yes the way we are born because he decided to give back to Children according to the way Saturn introduced because it was the Saturn that he introduced having children according to the last of the flesh foreign [Applause] only create a thunder by the spoken word he creates something I turned it into from nothing and when he created that when he saw Adam he felt he needed to express that artery and Adam was Adam came from the Lions Adam came from the mind of God Adam was born of Bones of God tell me he murdered him somewhere the image of God the image of God was created hallelujah amen the molding came afterwards Adam and then Man became a living a woman tonight [Music] [Applause] on them hallelujah amen and this man who was in the image of God created before he cut it out he is god-given right playing himself the devil came introduced another way hallelujah amen the devil came and introduced another way and I will introduce to you something which God is hiding from you but when you know him you realize it is good and what was that hallelujah amen the one who was speaking was the tree of knowledge it was having some good thing in it but it was evil Saturn is the tree of knowledge the food and Evil hear him he was she was eating [Music] it is [Applause] many things that are taught in school from the Tree of knowledge where did the guns come from the Tree of knowledge where did the soul has come from

the other one um they make antivirus for the other computer every computer did Adam have a vaccine did they all have vaccines because they didn't have viruses of the ground yeah what happened they met the viruses [Music] so friends it is not a sin CTV to take a a vaccine why right she got this body will never be redeemed and no man can kill this body all right before the Lord amen and for the soul after me no one can kill me hallelujah amen says that you will not die my name is take it if you need it it is your decision hallelujah amen we should know should not say oh it's the mark of the business is not the image of God that's why the devil don't understand does everything he wants to do on this go and touch his body again because that one is because the Bible says All Souls are mines but for the body how did it come it's not the same body Adam had before the fall oh foreign [Music] and the DNA of his father you want a scripture on it quickly quickly quickly open the Bible hallelujah hallelujah the word of God is so amazing things we can begin from 11. so this is the message that he had from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of that
