[Music] this is very important foreign [Music] differentiate between the message [Music] this person has a very different and peculiar parts is foreign foreign [Applause] and this second one is the prophecy what we can call the discernment of the earth to tell them their address foreign [Music] yeah usually when they come from design makers or politics foreign [Music] all right it is right here

himself as a prophet yeah Jesus [Applause] God has revealed himself as a prophet through the body of trees [Music] and that is Christ for your Christians speaking through a prophet himself [Music] and how was it anymore you remember all the conditions [Music] afternoon and waited space to come out so that we can see him for the first time as he is because the confusion yeah the way it is now is the same way it was in the day of Love by business finder they don't even have any thought of God they're by your promises Bible History God [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] full of this ministers [Applause] everything I mean let me know because of this watching or went to the doctor actually in the name of Jesus Christ remember if none of those friends introduction foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that one is the one that destroys everything foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] he that cannot eat my flesh [Music] [Applause] foreign he was a man like me to my flesh videos [Music] foreign deflection of God and the blood is the spirit of God the disciples says [Applause] foreign [Applause] is foreign the population [Applause] is when you say that there is foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] individually [Music] is the death of his Saints [Music] foreign [Music] come on refresh this message foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign scientists did not know science that a woman can actually as someone have two different seeds from two different uh um how could it have been he was asked how could it have been is that Cain and apple were twins they were not only Twins were Prince from two different fathers [Music] one of them was the father was Adam fathering and the other father was uh with the serpent tattoo [Music] I don't remember which race but I think she was a black woman there was a white woman who had a black baby and a white baby yes and it came in the papers and it was asked how did it happen [Music] a black boyfriend well itself this message that's many things science doesn't know yet [Music] if you stay long enough on this earth science will prove what we are preaching foreign negative science science has broken into goddess are you hearing me science science have you seen the video of people trying to multiply children the machines science is if we stay long enough here but God is permitting it to happen not much will happen because there has to be that mystery which is only left for the Believers just picking things into existence can't do that science so let them reproach this message but as far as we are concerned we are the people of the South Poles hallelujah amen we are the people of the revelation of the world [Music] hallelujah amen listen to me we are ready to Bear the reproach foreign the result which has Victory in Jesus my Savior forever [Music] Matthew 7. Mateo is and before we read that verse 13 says you know man tried to seek honor one from another and they honor one another and dishonor God by doing so um foreign foreign [Music] you know let me tell you I'm about to finish they couldn't be married I realize I'm not going to push this message in one day or in two days as long as the Lord is still inspiring me on it when it comes to following Christo he says white is the girl agament and Broad is the way that leads to destruction whenever at any time you say [Music] but everybody else is doing it [Music] which go in there [Music] when you take the broad way the criticism is not going to be much as a matter of fact you will not be reproached because you will feel even good you're in a group many times we preach to people they don't want to believe as individuals when you when if you meet a group of three four that's why for me when I'm evangelizing some of you evangelists can take a leave from this I always don't try to evangelize in a group when you evangelize many times you will not find one to believe because two hours of speaking who wants to believe baboon many people want to work in numbers that leads to destruction the gut is [Music] people will always break off from the first one and second pool when it comes to the sad pool it can only pull those ones who have a seed of God in them let me tell you those of us who believe this message there are many people who can stay in the message because of many reasons [Music] but I will tell you what if you are staying in this church because of the word you are here foreign [Music] for the sake of Christ for the sake of the review the word then I am sick and the devil can't convince me otherwise everything else that I need you promised to give them to me if he hasn't yet because he has delayed yeah always adjusting my face he has given them to me if he is not able to give them to me now I believe he'll give them to me tomorrow what is my sister's name is Fiona you see God Can Open Your Eyes by way of Medicine by way of doctors say that God uses doctors the medical Sciences of God you're very cartoon We Believe In Medical Science and we have a doctor in this church [Music] while I was preaching just my mind came to you right now no matter what cause the eyes to lose sight seeing song it doesn't have to be either medical some even say whether it's witchcraft the thing is God Can Open the Eyes of the blind to the extent he has even given eyeballs to those who did not have them [Music] did you know that even those who didn't have eyeballs many times differently means so that God can do we know that but now when he does it I know something the course will say well if he has not done it now it means you have no not enough Faith might not even have anything to do with it it might but it might not have anything today but one thing I want to tell you today tonight if you believe the word of God is putting you to Christ if it's Miracles he came to Christ they received everything they wanted they went away but they were Christians but those who are predestinated to life Hallelujah man it's not the Miracles that sustained them Hallelujah I can remain blind all my life and still serve God Faithfully God is able to open my eyes and he can choose to open them anytime he Wills yes and sister believe he is still in the business of doing that never lose Faith at any time faith is not a feeling of a big muscle faith is believing what your God can do and when you believe it take your faith on that ground okay I'm waiting for the rapture
