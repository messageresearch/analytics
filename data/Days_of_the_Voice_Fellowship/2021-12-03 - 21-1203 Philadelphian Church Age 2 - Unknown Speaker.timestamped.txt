[20:57] proceed with our
[20:59] bible study
[21:02] um
[21:05] the philadelphia church age i know we
[21:07] had reached some place
[21:09] and
[21:11] so we're just going to proceed with that
[21:15] all right
[21:16] so we're going to start the edge of the
[21:19] open door
[21:20] so i want us to to do the listening and
[21:23] then we shall do the discussion
[21:26] amen
[21:36] okay so i'm going to play this
[21:40] uh from the edge of the open door you
[21:42] can follow you can follow in your book
[21:48] filthy wares
[21:49] god raised up mighty warriors of faith
[21:52] and the greatest works of christ okay
[21:58] did we finish the edge of the open door
[22:04] i think
[22:07] sorry
[22:10] we finished the salutation last time so
[22:12] we're supposed to be beginning with the
[22:13] edge of the open door the age of the
[22:15] open door okay
[22:17] revelation 3
[22:19] 8
[22:20] i know thy works
[22:22] behold i have set before thee an open
[22:24] door and no man can shut it
[22:26] for thou hast to little strength and has
[22:28] kept my word and has not denied my name
[22:32] the first phrase of this verse
[22:34] i know thy works is analyzed in the rest
[22:37] of the verse for their works had to do
[22:39] with the open door little strength the
[22:42] word and the name
[22:44] in order to understand the wealth of
[22:46] meaning involved in
[22:48] behold i set before you an open door and
[22:50] no man can shut it
[22:52] we must now recall what has been said
[22:54] about each age running over into another
[22:56] age
[22:57] there is an overlapping a melting or
[22:59] fading into
[23:00] rather than an abrupt end and a
[23:02] clear-cut start
[23:04] this age particularly flows into the
[23:06] next stage
[23:07] and not only does this age overflow into
[23:09] the last stage but the last age is in
[23:12] many respects simply a carrying on of
[23:14] the sixth age
[23:15] the seventh age a very short age gathers
[23:18] up into itself for one quick work
[23:21] all the evil of every age and yet all
[23:23] the reality of pentecost
[23:26] once the philadelphian age has about run
[23:28] its course the laodicean age quickly
[23:30] comes in
[23:31] bringing both the tears and the wheat to
[23:33] harvest
[23:35] first bind the tears to burn them but
[23:37] gather the wheat into my barn
[23:39] matthew 13 30.
[23:42] remember please that the sardisian age
[23:44] started the reformation that must still
[23:45] go on until the grain that was planted
[23:47] at pentecost goes through the full cycle
[23:50] of planting watering nourishing etc
[23:53] until it comes right back to original
[23:55] seed
[23:56] while this is going on the tears that
[23:58] were sown will have to go through their
[24:00] cycle and be harvested also
[24:02] that is exactly what we see happening
[24:05] if you can just think of the seasons you
[24:07] can get a very good picture of this
[24:10] the plant that you see growing in full
[24:12] strength in summer suddenly appears to
[24:14] be going to seed
[24:16] you can't tell exactly when summer
[24:18] became autumn
[24:19] it just faded into it
[24:21] that is how the ages are and especially
[24:23] these last two
[24:25] it is to this age that jesus says
[24:27] i come quickly
[24:29] verse 11.
[24:31] that makes the last stage a very short
[24:33] one laodicea is the age of the quick
[24:36] work
[24:36] it is cut short
[24:39] now we will specifically dwell on the
[24:41] open door that no man can shut
[24:43] first of all i want to dwell on the open
[24:45] door as signifying the tremendous
[24:47] missionary effort of that age
[24:50] paul called a new missionary endeavor
[24:51] for the lord and open door
[24:54] second corinthians 2 12
[24:57] furthermore when i came to troas to
[24:58] preach christ's gospel
[25:00] and a door was opened unto me of the
[25:02] lord
[25:03] so we can see by the comparison of
[25:05] scriptures that this open door signified
[25:08] the greatest spreading of the gospel
[25:09] that the world has ever seen
[25:12] i want you to see something here
[25:14] god works in threes doesn't he
[25:17] it was in the third or pergament age
[25:19] that the church was married to the state
[25:21] the deeds of the nicolaitans had become
[25:23] the doctrine of the nicolaitans
[25:26] that age was the open door for the false
[25:28] vine
[25:29] once it was backed up by the power of
[25:31] the state it became actually a world
[25:33] system even though it bore the name
[25:35] christian
[25:36] thus it spread like wildfire
[25:39] but now three ages later after a long
[25:41] and hard struggle of faith here comes
[25:43] the open door to the truth
[25:46] the word of the lord now has its day
[25:48] of course the fifth age had set the
[25:50] stage for this mighty move as that age
[25:53] gave us exploration colonization the
[25:55] printing of books etc
[25:58] it would have been wonderful if this
[25:59] open door had followed the divine
[26:01] pattern of pentecost which was set forth
[26:03] in hebrews two one through four
[26:07] therefore we ought to give the more
[26:08] earnest heed to the things which we have
[26:10] heard
[26:11] lest at any time we should let them slip
[26:14] for if the word spoken by angels was
[26:16] steadfast and every transgression and
[26:18] disobedience received a just recompense
[26:20] of reward
[26:21] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[26:24] great salvation which at the first began
[26:26] to be spoken by the lord and was
[26:29] confirmed unto us by them that heard him
[26:32] god also bearing them witness both with
[26:34] signs and wonders and with diverse
[26:36] miracles and gifts of the holy ghost
[26:39] according to his own will
[26:42] now you know that this is the pattern
[26:43] for jesus himself said so
[26:46] mark 16 15-20
[26:49] and he said unto them
[26:51] go ye into all the world and preach the
[26:53] gospel to every creature
[26:55] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[26:57] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[27:00] be damned
[27:02] and these signs shall follow them that
[27:04] believe
[27:05] in my name shall they cast out devils
[27:07] they shall speak with new tongues they
[27:09] shall take up serpents
[27:11] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[27:13] shall not hurt them
[27:14] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[27:16] they shall recover
[27:18] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[27:20] them he was received up into heaven and
[27:22] sat on the right hand of god
[27:24] and they went forth and preached
[27:26] everywhere the lord working with them
[27:29] and confirming the word with signs
[27:30] following
[27:32] amen he never told them to go into all
[27:35] the world and establish bible colleges
[27:38] nor did he tell them to pass out
[27:40] literature
[27:41] now these things are fine but what jesus
[27:43] told them to do was to preach the gospel
[27:46] stick with the word and then the signs
[27:49] would follow
[27:50] the very first introduction we have in
[27:52] the way the kingdom of god was to be
[27:54] preached was when he sent out the twelve
[27:57] in matthew 10 1-8
[28:00] he commissioned and instructed them on
[28:02] this wise
[28:03] and when he had called unto him his
[28:05] twelve disciples he gave them power
[28:08] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[28:10] and to heal all manner of sickness and
[28:13] all manner of disease
[28:15] now the names of the twelve apostles are
[28:17] these
[28:18] the first simon who is called peter and
[28:21] andrew his brother
[28:22] james the son of zebedee
[28:24] and john his brother
[28:26] philip and bartholomew
[28:28] thomas and matthew the publican
[28:30] james the son of alphaeus
[28:32] and labias whose surname was stadius
[28:36] simon the canaanite and judas iscariot
[28:39] who also betrayed him
[28:41] these twelve jesus sent forth and
[28:42] commanded them saying
[28:44] go not into the way of the gentiles and
[28:46] into any city of the samaritans enter ye
[28:48] not
[28:49] but go rather to the lost sheep of the
[28:51] house of israel
[28:53] and as ye go preach saying the kingdom
[28:55] of heaven is at hand
[28:57] heal the sick cleanse the lepers
[29:00] raise the dead cast out devils freely ye
[29:02] have received freely give
[29:06] this ministry that he gave them was
[29:07] actually the sharing of his own ministry
[29:09] with them for it says in matthew 9 35-38
[29:14] and jesus went about all the cities and
[29:16] villages teaching in their synagogues
[29:19] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[29:21] and healing every sickness and every
[29:23] disease among the people
[29:25] but when he saw the multitudes he was
[29:27] moved with compassion on them because
[29:29] they fainted and were scattered abroad
[29:31] as sheep having no shepherd
[29:33] then saith he unto his disciples
[29:36] the harvest truly is plenteous
[29:38] but the laborers are few
[29:40] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[29:41] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[29:44] into his harvest
[29:46] now many people have the idea that just
[29:48] the apostles had this ministry given
[29:50] them by our lord jesus and so when they
[29:52] died the ministry was over
[29:54] that is not so
[29:56] here in luke 10 1 through 9 we find that
[29:59] in the days of his earthly sojourn he
[30:01] had already started to give ministries
[30:03] of power to his own
[30:05] after these things the lord appointed
[30:06] other seventy also
[30:08] and sent them two and two before his
[30:10] face into every city and place whether
[30:13] he himself would come
[30:15] therefore said he unto them
[30:17] the harvest truly is great but the
[30:19] laborers are few
[30:21] pray therefore the lord of the harvest
[30:23] that he would send forth laborers into
[30:25] his harvest
[30:26] go your ways
[30:28] behold i send you forth as lambs among
[30:31] wolves
[30:32] carry neither purse nor script nor shoes
[30:35] and salute no man by the way
[30:37] and into whatsoever house ye enter first
[30:39] say
[30:40] peace be to this house
[30:42] and if the son of peace be there your
[30:44] peace shall rest upon it
[30:46] if not it shall turn to you again
[30:49] and in the same house remain eating and
[30:51] drinking such things as they give for
[30:53] the laborer is worthy of his hire
[30:55] go not from house to house
[30:58] and into whatsoever city ye enter and
[31:00] they receive you eat such things as are
[31:02] set before you and heal the sick that
[31:04] are therein and say unto them the
[31:07] kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
[31:11] who would dare deny the mighty ministry
[31:12] of philip who would dare to deny the
[31:15] mighty ministries of iranians martin
[31:18] patrick and countless scores of others
[31:20] who have had god's anointing upon them
[31:22] yes
[31:24] the bible way is the real way of the
[31:26] open door
[31:27] and i want to add my testimony to that
[31:30] the reason i have to do that is because
[31:32] i can only speak with assurance
[31:34] concerning what god has done in my own
[31:35] life
[31:36] so if you'll excuse a personal note here
[31:39] i will tell you how i know for a surety
[31:41] that jesus is the same yesterday and
[31:43] today and forever
[31:45] and that the power of god is still
[31:47] available to those who will believe and
[31:48] receive
[31:50] during my missionary trip to south
[31:52] africa
[31:53] god so blessed that when i came to
[31:56] durban the only place that could begin
[31:57] to accommodate the people was the huge
[31:59] racetrack
[32:00] which is the second largest in the world
[32:02] the crowd was well over one hundred
[32:04] thousand
[32:05] in order to keep law and order they had
[32:07] to put up fences to separate the various
[32:09] tribes they posted hundreds of policemen
[32:12] to keep the throngs quieted down
[32:14] those hungry souls had come for many
[32:16] miles
[32:17] a queen from rhodesia had come with a
[32:19] train of 27 coaches loaded with african
[32:21] natives
[32:22] they struggled in across the fields and
[32:24] mountains bearing on their backs for
[32:26] many and many a mile some loved one that
[32:28] needed help the whole country was
[32:30] stirred by the mighty works that had
[32:32] been manifested by the holy spirit
[32:35] one afternoon as i began to minister
[32:37] one of thousands of the muhammadans came
[32:39] up on the platform
[32:41] as she stood before me a missionary to
[32:43] the muhammadans began to softly implore
[32:45] the lord
[32:46] oh for that precious soul
[32:48] oh for that precious soul
[32:51] he had been over there for years and
[32:52] years and according to his own testimony
[32:55] he had seen only one muhammadan come to
[32:57] receive jesus christ as savior
[33:00] they were originally the medo persians
[33:02] whose laws change not
[33:04] they are so hard to win
[33:06] it seems that once a always a
[33:09] is a law amongst them
[33:12] well as she stood before me i began to
[33:14] speak to her and to all those thousands
[33:16] through the interpreters
[33:18] i said
[33:19] is it not so that the missionaries have
[33:21] told you of a jesus who came to save you
[33:24] you should have seen the people look at
[33:26] each other when i said that
[33:27] then when they had answered that was
[33:29] correct i went on and said
[33:32] but did the missionaries read to you out
[33:34] of this book
[33:35] i held my bible a lot for them to see
[33:38] that this same jesus was a mighty healer
[33:40] and that he would live in his people
[33:42] down through the ages until he came
[33:44] again to receive them unto himself
[33:47] did they tell you that because of that
[33:49] same spirit in them that was in jesus
[33:51] that they would be able to do mighty
[33:53] works even as jesus did
[33:55] did they tell you that you can be healed
[33:57] even as you can be saved
[33:59] how many of you would like to see this
[34:01] same jesus come down amongst us and do
[34:03] the same things that he did when he was
[34:05] here on earth long ago
[34:07] they all wanted that
[34:09] that is one thing they surely agreed on
[34:12] i then went on
[34:14] if jesus by his spirit will do what he
[34:17] did when upon earth will you believe his
[34:19] word then
[34:21] and here was that muhammadan woman in
[34:23] front of me
[34:24] the spirit began to move through me
[34:26] i said to her
[34:28] now you know that i don't know you
[34:31] i can't even speak your language
[34:33] she admitted that
[34:35] i said
[34:36] as for healing you you know i cannot
[34:38] but you heard the message this afternoon
[34:40] and understood me
[34:42] her indian interpreter answered back for
[34:44] her that she understood for she had read
[34:46] the new testament
[34:48] now the muhammadans are descendants of
[34:50] abraham
[34:51] they believe in one god
[34:53] but they reject jesus as the son of god
[34:55] and instead they take muhammad as his
[34:57] prophet
[34:58] they say that jesus never died and rose
[35:01] again they are taught that by their
[35:03] priests and they believe it
[35:05] i said
[35:06] but jesus did die and rise again
[35:09] he sent his spirit back upon the church
[35:12] that spirit that was in him is the very
[35:13] same spirit in the church now and it can
[35:16] and will produce what jesus produced
[35:19] he said in john 5 19
[35:22] the son can do nothing of himself
[35:24] but what he seeth the father do
[35:27] for what things so ever he doeth these
[35:29] also doeth the sun likewise
[35:32] now then if jesus will come and reveal
[35:34] to me what your trouble is or what you
[35:36] are here for
[35:37] if he can tell me what your past is
[35:40] surely you can believe for the future
[35:43] she said through her interpreter
[35:45] yes i can
[35:46] i said
[35:48] all right may he do it
[35:50] those muhammadans were watching intently
[35:53] they were all leaning forward to see
[35:54] what would happen
[35:56] then the holy spirit spoke
[35:59] your husband is a short heavyset man
[36:01] with a black mustache
[36:02] you have two children
[36:04] you were at the doctors about three days
[36:06] ago and he gave you an examination
[36:08] you have a cyst on the womb
[36:11] she bowed her head and said
[36:13] that is true
[36:15] i asked her
[36:17] how is it you came to me a christian why
[36:19] didn't you go to your muhammadan prophet
[36:22] she said
[36:23] i think you can help me
[36:25] i said
[36:26] i can't help you but if you receive
[36:28] jesus christ as your savior he who is
[36:30] here now and knows all about you he'll
[36:33] help you
[36:34] she said
[36:36] i accept jesus as my savior
[36:38] that did it she was healed and about ten
[36:41] thousand muhammadans came to christ that
[36:43] day because the gospel was preached in
[36:45] both word and power
[36:47] god never told a man to labor thirty
[36:49] years and harvest nothing
[36:51] he gave us the open door of word and
[36:54] power and that is what we are supposed
[36:55] to use
[36:57] that is what gave paul his great and
[36:58] effective ministry
[37:00] first corinthians 2 4
[37:03] and my speech and my preaching was not
[37:05] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[37:08] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[37:09] power
[37:11] listen to
[37:14] uh i just want to make a few comments a
[37:17] few remarks
[37:19] i hope you've been following yes
[37:23] now um
[37:26] you see here he speaks of the age
[37:29] he calls philadelphia the age of the
[37:31] open door
[37:34] and when did philadelphia start
[37:37] according to brother barnum and when did
[37:39] it stop
[37:41] i'm talking about the age
[37:43] you do not know
[37:48] well go right ahead and check
[37:52] the other time i remember you were
[37:53] speaking
[37:54] uh the dates very with much ease now you
[37:58] have forgotten all of the sudden
[38:01] okay
[38:02] when does it start by the polyglot
[38:06] to 1906.
[38:08] and when does
[38:11] do you remember when azusa street took
[38:13] place
[38:16] azusa street revival azusa street that
[38:19] they're outpowering at azusa
[38:22] you've i did we not discuss about that
[38:25] sometime back
[38:27] yes we did i even had you watch the
[38:30] movie on the azusa street
[38:34] regarding the testimonies of people who
[38:36] were there at azusa
[38:38] did you not watch that
[38:40] how many did watch it
[38:42] now i can see i'm amazed that you people
[38:45] can forget that way
[38:47] we did uh maybe you maybe it might have
[38:49] been my few family members yeah but i i
[38:51] remember you we did i didn't show it to
[38:53] you on this screen up here
[38:55] so you see uh
[38:59] that event took place in 1906. we see
[39:02] that that was now the breaking forth of
[39:04] the pentecostal movement or the the
[39:06] beginning of the pentecostal era or time
[39:09] but
[39:10] that's why
[39:11] as we were listening but the banham
[39:14] says that uh
[39:16] uh
[39:17] quickly this philadelphia the elevation
[39:20] church educates the last
[39:22] quickly starts
[39:24] when this philadelphian age is almost
[39:27] coming to an end and the other one
[39:29] quickly starts
[39:31] so it's like
[39:33] it it just uh starts at the climax of
[39:36] the other one
[39:37] now we see that uh the philadelphian age
[39:39] was an edge of the open door yes just
[39:42] like the scripture saying that that
[39:43] behold i give you an open door but one
[39:46] thing that i wanted to comment on here
[39:48] he says that the open door
[39:51] okay let's uh let me read that portion
[39:54] for you
[39:54] which makes him to give his testimony
[39:57] he says yes
[39:59] the bible way is the real way of the
[40:01] open door
[40:03] and i want to add my testimony to that
[40:06] the reason i have to do that is because
[40:08] i can only speak with assurance
[40:09] concerning what god has done in my own
[40:11] life
[40:13] so if you will excuse a personal note
[40:15] here i will tell you how i know for a
[40:17] surety
[40:19] that jesus is the same yesterday today
[40:22] and forever and the power of god is
[40:24] still available to those who will
[40:25] believe and receive now
[40:28] here is how about abandonment defines
[40:30] the open door but the bottom defines the
[40:32] open door as jesus christ the same
[40:34] yesterday and forever
[40:35] and he says that the bible way is the
[40:37] way is the real way of the open door
[40:40] some people think that uh
[40:42] you know the open door means that uh
[40:44] blessings and um you know you you know
[40:48] going through life and overcoming but
[40:50] actually
[40:51] in this generation the open door that
[40:54] god had given to the messenger and the
[40:56] people in that generation was an open
[40:58] door to take the word okay
[41:01] they were able to take the word to all
[41:04] the nations of the earth
[41:06] and many missionaries died
[41:08] even here in africa
[41:11] you've no doubt been in school and you
[41:13] have been able to learn about the
[41:15] missionaries it's a subject in which
[41:17] language in which subject
[41:19] history or sst in primary do they study
[41:22] about missionaries in primary school
[41:24] yes missionaries so there's those
[41:26] missionaries
[41:28] uh
[41:29] when did they go out it was between 1750
[41:32] and 1906 that was the time of the great
[41:34] missionaries that went out
[41:37] you know god gave them so much love
[41:39] within their hearts to love the others
[41:42] and you see that if you love the others
[41:43] the best you can do
[41:45] is to give them the word you cannot
[41:47] claim that you love someone and you
[41:48] don't give them the word then that means
[41:50] you do not love them
[41:52] so we see that but abanamiya gives his
[41:54] testimony of how
[41:56] then god
[41:58] gave him an open door and of course him
[42:01] being the
[42:02] the the audition church age messenger to
[42:05] the last church age
[42:07] uh he was able
[42:09] uh to have god gave him an open door we
[42:11] know that
[42:12] uh his ministry was in three pools ah
[42:16] you remember that
[42:17] what was the first pull of the ministry
[42:20] of the prophet
[42:22] when i said pool it could it would also
[42:24] mean phases three phases
[42:27] that his ministry was in three phases
[42:30] just like we have had read up there he
[42:32] said that
[42:33] god always works in threes in threes in
[42:36] threes
[42:37] so what was the first phase or the first
[42:39] pool of his ministry
[42:43] the miracles yes and how did the
[42:45] miracles happen
[42:48] healing remember he was given a sign
[42:52] that sign was like the one that moses
[42:54] was given of putting his fist
[42:56] under his uh you remember how much was
[42:59] it was told and then when it removed it
[43:01] was reprocessed when took back removed
[43:04] it was here so i told him that when you
[43:06] touch people by your right hand
[43:09] you will be able to dictate to detect by
[43:11] vibrations what is wrong with them
[43:13] you would you that's how he was doing it
[43:16] and when the the the the disease goes
[43:18] out he would be able to detect also and
[43:20] satan has gone
[43:22] that way that worked in his first in the
[43:24] first phase of his ministry
[43:26] and then comes the the the second phase
[43:29] of his ministry what was it
[43:33] sorry
[43:35] disarmament okay
[43:37] can someone one of you explain
[43:39] disarmament
[43:47] yes
[44:06] well
[44:07] that is true
[44:08] discernment is being able to tear the
[44:12] secrets of one's heart
[44:14] of course jesus had that
[44:17] but and we noticed from jesus by the way
[44:20] did you know that from jesus
[44:22] no one had that
[44:24] designment of the heart
[44:25] because that was a messianic sign
[44:30] you can try and remember
[44:32] when that woman was designed she ran to
[44:35] the city and told them come see a man
[44:37] who has told me the secrets of my heart
[44:39] isn't this the very messiah she
[44:41] recognized that jesus was the messiah
[44:43] because of designing her heart
[44:46] and the nine spiritual gifts of the
[44:48] bible of the book of acts in the new
[44:51] testament he talks about the nine
[44:53] spiritual gifts now we talked about them
[44:56] the other time
[44:57] now those nine spiritual gifts
[45:00] that is what we call designate of spirit
[45:02] or designment of spirits but what
[45:04] actually the prophet had was designated
[45:06] of the heart
[45:08] like he did not only design the spirits
[45:09] of people but he would design the very
[45:13] the very heart of the people and you
[45:15] cannot truly do that unless
[45:17] you know those people
[45:19] and that's only god who knows us
[45:22] and so it was not him
[45:23] but it was god who would come in the
[45:25] meeting to vindicate the ministry of
[45:27] brother bana
[45:29] before the people
[45:30] and that was the second phase the second
[45:32] pool of his ministry it brought people
[45:34] towards him and people
[45:36] really accepted this ministry but then
[45:39] there is that third pool or third phase
[45:40] of his ministry
[45:42] which very many people
[45:44] have uh were stumbled when it was
[45:47] started to starting to get manifested
[45:50] so was it also in the days of jesus
[45:53] jesus when he was manifesting the third
[45:56] pool he remember what he said
[45:58] he said
[46:00] if you do not drink my flesh and you
[46:02] don't drink my if you don't eat my flesh
[46:04] and you don't drink my blood you are not
[46:06] part of me
[46:07] now the people were offended how can you
[46:09] tell us to be vampires they all ran away
[46:12] because they fail to understand
[46:14] that jesus was speaking to only those
[46:17] that he came for his ministry was now
[46:19] coming into do you know that all these
[46:21] things that happened in the first and
[46:22] second pool were good and were part of
[46:24] his ministry but they were not the real
[46:26] purpose why he came the real purpose why
[46:29] he came was to be able to attract
[46:32] those people that where he is before the
[46:34] foundation of the world by the
[46:36] revelation of the third pool okay
[46:39] what's the third pool the third pool is
[46:41] the revelation of
[46:43] the word it is not no longer the signs
[46:45] and wonders it's no longer the
[46:47] discernment and the great miracles but
[46:49] now it is
[46:51] the word the revelation the revelation
[46:53] the revealing of the word the revealing
[46:55] of himself the revealing of the son of
[46:58] man you understand what i'm saying
[46:59] talking about
[47:00] in revelation 17 30. now i want to show
[47:03] you this
[47:04] what does it say in revelation 17 that
[47:06] somebody read it out from your bible
[47:08] right now
[47:09] what does it say um did i say revelation
[47:12] i meant to say luke 17 30.
[47:14] excuse me
[47:16] luke 17 30. check it out and tell me
[47:19] what it says
[47:20] okay are you there
[47:27] and he said
[47:29] nay father abraham but if one went and
[47:33] to them from the dead they will repent
[47:36] and he said unto him if they
[47:38] hear not moses and the prophets neither
[47:41] will they be persuaded thou
[47:45] though
[47:46] one rose from the dead
[47:48] you're reading a wrong part
[47:52] you read in chapter 16
[48:02] even thus
[48:04] shall it be in the day
[48:08] in the day
[48:10] when the son of man
[48:12] is
[48:14] revealed
[48:16] wait a moment what is he talking about
[48:18] when he says even thus meaning even like
[48:20] that
[48:21] but
[48:22] if you want to know the conditions he's
[48:24] talking about you can see them from the
[48:26] verses before verse 17 verse 30.
[48:29] he says that in the days of lord they
[48:31] married
[48:32] you know they did that until the fire
[48:34] came and burnt them all in the days of
[48:36] noah you know
[48:38] and now he says even thus
[48:40] in the same way it shall be
[48:43] when the in the days when the son of man
[48:45] is being
[48:46] revealed are you hearing me
[48:48] who is the son of man the son of man
[48:52] jesus christ jesus christ is the son of
[48:55] man right yes
[48:56] now
[48:57] the son of man
[48:59] would be revealed okay yes now but
[49:02] remember jesus christ has three offices
[49:05] jesus
[49:06] has three
[49:08] offices as a son
[49:11] what is his first officer
[49:16] yes
[49:18] son of man is his first office
[49:21] son of man
[49:22] is what
[49:24] he reveals himself as
[49:26] a prophet
[49:27] prophetic ministry son of man prophet
[49:30] prophetic ministry
[49:32] and
[49:33] in that same
[49:35] anointing he is able to go
[49:38] and die
[49:39] he actually concludes that ministry
[49:42] by being killed by dying and becoming a
[49:44] sacrifice
[49:46] he died
[49:47] after prophesying for three years and a
[49:48] half
[49:49] he was killed
[49:51] on the cross
[49:52] and he died and rose again and then
[49:54] after the resurrection he came on the
[49:56] day of pentecost and when he came under
[49:59] that pentecost he is no longer son of
[50:01] man but he is
[50:03] son of
[50:04] god
[50:05] now son of god is the holy spirit
[50:07] dispensation it's a god working in the
[50:09] form of the holy spirit so today is son
[50:11] of god if we believe him we receive him
[50:14] in our in our hearts as son of
[50:16] god
[50:18] now
[50:18] him who also is the son of god
[50:22] must also come back again as a son of
[50:24] david when does he come outside the son
[50:26] of david
[50:29] sorry
[50:30] speak loudly
[50:36] he really comes as the son of david
[50:39] on the day of judgment okay because
[50:41] that's when he's sitting actually not
[50:43] before before even the day of judgment
[50:44] but actually in the millennium
[50:47] because in the millennium that's when
[50:48] he's seated on the throne of david he's
[50:49] a king because son of david is a king
[50:53] in the tribulation
[50:54] he is
[50:55] um he is
[50:57] uh still the savior he is redeeming
[51:01] not the savior to the gentiles but the
[51:03] savior to the jews
[51:04] because he has also to save the 144
[51:07] thousand what jews
[51:09] so he has to be revealed to them as a
[51:12] son of man son of god and son of david
[51:15] because remember by the bottom says they
[51:17] receive the holy spirit just like we did
[51:19] so everything he is to eat to us he has
[51:22] to be to them during the tribulation
[51:23] while the gentile church is going
[51:25] through their own chaos
[51:27] and now we see that he come now finally
[51:30] as son of
[51:31] david
[51:32] in the millennium and on the day of
[51:34] judgment
[51:35] now
[51:37] here is another part i want you to see
[51:39] that
[51:40] when he says in the book of luke 17 30
[51:42] that even thus shall it be in the days
[51:45] when the son of man
[51:48] is
[51:49] revealed so the son of man is is going
[51:51] to be revealed now remember the son of
[51:54] man is rule
[51:58] the son of man is who
[52:00] jesus christ right jesus now that jesus
[52:04] being revealed as
[52:06] a pro it is prophetic ministry
[52:09] ministering to us
[52:11] so we notice that brother bannon is a
[52:12] prophet
[52:13] but actually brother banham was not
[52:15] revealing him himself
[52:17] just like john was not revealing
[52:19] himself
[52:21] john was revealing
[52:22] jesus christ you remember he says
[52:27] um in the book of john chapter one
[52:30] um well is it john chapter one
[52:33] he says he was not that light talking
[52:36] about john huh
[52:37] you you you read it open it in your
[52:40] bible you see we're in a bible study so
[52:42] we cannot justify to things without
[52:44] reading them
[52:47] john chapter one
[52:49] open in john
[52:51] chapter one
[52:54] are you there
[52:56] okay i want you to look at um
[53:01] verses uh
[53:03] six
[53:04] there was a man sent from god whose name
[53:07] was
[53:08] john
[53:09] the same came for a witness to bear
[53:12] witness of the light
[53:15] that all men through him might be
[53:18] he was not that
[53:20] light
[53:20] but was
[53:22] saying to bear
[53:25] okay are you seeing that
[53:27] and who is that light
[53:29] jesus is the light
[53:31] so we said that john was only saying to
[53:33] bear witness
[53:35] of that light so
[53:37] brother banham was not the light but
[53:39] obama was not the son of man but this
[53:42] son of man that was going to be revealed
[53:44] was jesus christ so
[53:46] brother branham as a messenger just like
[53:48] john was revealing to the people the son
[53:52] of man you understand it
[53:54] so but that's why when he would design
[53:56] that people would tell them who did the
[53:57] touch who did he touch he never
[53:59] touched me i'm not even close to them
[54:00] but who did they touch you know that
[54:02] woman who touched jesus and jesus was
[54:04] able to to heal you without even you
[54:06] know
[54:07] turning so he said that it's not me i'm
[54:10] a man but it is jesus who is here
[54:13] revealing himself to us
[54:15] so the ministry of the prophet has been
[54:17] able to reveal the son of man to us
[54:20] how in the form of the revealing of the
[54:23] word
[54:24] that's the third pool the revelation of
[54:27] the one
[54:28] the demolition of jesus christ which is
[54:29] the revelation of the wife
[54:31] and that
[54:33] even under this third phase of his
[54:35] ministry now he has to
[54:39] manifest his presence he has to manifest
[54:41] his power he has to manifest you
[54:43] understand
[54:44] because this is the place this is the
[54:46] time
[54:46] when he
[54:48] has to
[54:49] uh show his presence to be among us who
[54:52] have received this third phase
[54:56] how many understand that
[55:00] you don't understand that what part
[55:02] don't you understand
[55:06] it's all right go ahead and ask we're in
[55:08] a bible study
[55:14] all right
[55:16] it's good you can air your confusion
[55:32] okay the last part
[55:33] that talks about what
[55:43] three phases the first phase was the
[55:46] phase of healing miracles the second
[55:48] phase was there's you know the
[55:50] discernment designing the people's
[55:52] hearts and all that you know then the
[55:55] the the third phase
[55:57] was
[56:00] the revelation of the world
[56:01] it has already happened
[56:03] and we are walking in that third phase
[56:06] we're already in the third pool the
[56:07] third phase of his ministry
[56:10] not actually the minister of brother but
[56:12] the minister of christ in our day
[56:14] we are living in that time so
[56:16] we have already accepted the word and
[56:18] now we are waiting for him to come and
[56:20] do it
[56:21] claim us hallelujah you know that part
[56:24] of claiming he's going to come and claim
[56:26] even jesus he purchased us that's that's
[56:29] the first phase the second phase
[56:31] he
[56:32] intercedes for us and in the third phase
[56:36] he claims us to himself in the rapture
[56:39] so always god works in threes into this
[56:41] entity so we say
[56:43] here in the philadelphia church age
[56:45] but the banham actually did talk about
[56:47] those trees also somewhere did i see
[56:49] that somewhere here
[56:54] so there is somewhere where you talked
[56:55] about the threes
[56:57] and he said that
[57:01] i'm trying to find that part
[57:03] if you do find that part before i do
[57:04] please let us know where it is
[57:12] i think it should be that portion where
[57:14] i was reading it was in the third oh
[57:16] pagaman age that the church was married
[57:18] to the state
[57:20] the deeds of the nicolas had become the
[57:23] doctrine of the nicolaitans that's in
[57:25] the pegamon church age right
[57:27] that age was the up
[57:29] that age was the open door for the
[57:31] fourth vine
[57:33] that age that's when they started to
[57:35] come in
[57:36] once it was backed up by the power of
[57:38] the state it became actually a wild
[57:40] system even though it it bore the name
[57:44] it had the name christian
[57:46] thus it spread like wildfire but now
[57:49] three ages later because remember after
[57:51] pegamos then
[57:55] then tatira after that then
[57:58] then studies
[58:00] so how many edges
[58:04] how many edges
[58:06] then comes the third
[58:10] philadelphia so after three ages
[58:13] but now after three ages later or three
[58:15] ages later after a long and a hard
[58:17] struggle of faith
[58:18] here comes the open door to the truth
[58:22] you know this reminds me the story of
[58:23] akimas ahimas and kush
[58:26] one day i don't know if i didn't talk
[58:27] about it in the chat but it's a very
[58:29] interesting story
[58:31] you know
[58:32] the
[58:32] job told
[58:34] kush to run and go tell the king the
[58:36] news of what has happened
[58:39] on the battlefield
[58:40] and he ran with all his might and before
[58:43] actually he started to run around with
[58:45] all his might
[58:46] then kev akima's ahimas came from
[58:48] nowhere he said i had the noise i had
[58:50] the rise i had the noise i also want to
[58:52] go and tell the king he said but you are
[58:54] going to tell the king what he said
[58:56] please just allow me i'm feeling the
[58:58] fire i'm feeling the anointing i'm
[58:59] feeling whatever i want to go and tell
[59:01] the king what has happened he said
[59:04] because they troubled him he said okay
[59:05] fine you can't go.
[59:06] so but the man did not know what
[59:08] happened so when he reached he read he
[59:10] even took a shortcut he did not use the
[59:12] the real way took a shortcut and when he
[59:14] reached the king where the king was
[59:16] he the king asks him how tell me is my
[59:18] son absolutely
[59:20] okay
[59:22] hallelujah glory to god or whatever it
[59:24] is you see i had a lot of noise and
[59:26] people were shouting at the ah and then
[59:28] i also
[59:29] i told you what was that said i said it
[59:32] is my son absolutely my life said oh
[59:34] king i tell you i heard out of the noise
[59:35] i was about and then i said i have to
[59:37] come and tell you what he said you just
[59:39] stand there because he wasn't aware he
[59:42] didn't have the real news just stand
[59:44] there and and be quiet
[59:46] he told him just stand there and be
[59:48] quiet
[59:48] and then
[59:50] kush was running slow at sure but he was
[59:52] on the right way huh
[59:54] he arrived also and when he arrived and
[59:57] then he talked to the king
[59:59] the king was so happy to hear his news
[1:00:01] and he said he's my son absolutely my
[1:00:03] life and and and kush was like
[1:00:06] oh oh long live the king for sure your
[1:00:08] son you know he he was uh they were
[1:00:11] running after him and then he was
[1:00:13] trapped within a tree and
[1:00:15] and job finished him off and so he died
[1:00:19] ah the king started crying
[1:00:22] and sobbing because his son absalom was
[1:00:24] dead because his son was staging a coup
[1:00:25] by the way but he eventually died but he
[1:00:28] didn't want him to die anyway
[1:00:29] so what does it teach us it teaches us
[1:00:31] that usually the one who doesn't have
[1:00:33] the right news or the right message
[1:00:36] wants to run fast
[1:00:38] and they finish you before the right
[1:00:40] message comes that's why even jesus
[1:00:42] christ said oh those who came before me
[1:00:44] were thieves and robbers
[1:00:48] you know can you imagine that's what
[1:00:50] jesus would say
[1:00:51] all the pharisees said this is that they
[1:00:53] were all thieves and robbers but i'm the
[1:00:55] one i'm the bread of life i am so in the
[1:00:57] same way here the the first church the
[1:01:00] first vine had its open door in in in
[1:01:04] what
[1:01:05] in in in pegamos
[1:01:08] pegamos remember that's what that was
[1:01:09] the time when they the first church
[1:01:11] started out and they had their own wrong
[1:01:13] systems and then you know wrong
[1:01:17] they made their own marriage state and
[1:01:19] and the church and they married together
[1:01:21] came together as one and they decided to
[1:01:23] enforce the wrong doctrines but by the
[1:01:25] power of the state you remember that so
[1:01:28] that's when the wrong seed was planted
[1:01:30] the wrong seed really got established
[1:01:32] and actually the bible talks about the
[1:01:33] throne
[1:01:35] of saturn itself being in pegamos so we
[1:01:38] see that that time was the time of your
[1:01:40] paper
[1:01:41] for the for the
[1:01:43] for the
[1:01:44] first vine
[1:01:46] but here
[1:01:47] after three ages three i love three
[1:01:50] three it's got the number of
[1:01:52] perfection hallelujah
[1:01:55] three ages later
[1:01:57] hallelujah
[1:01:58] three ages later i said what
[1:02:02] three ages later calm
[1:02:04] a time of
[1:02:06] the open door for the true vine
[1:02:10] do you love this yes
[1:02:14] he says
[1:02:16] but now three ages later after a long
[1:02:20] struggle of faith here comes the open
[1:02:23] door to there
[1:02:26] the word of the lord has its day the
[1:02:28] word the lord has
[1:02:30] his death of course the fifth age had
[1:02:32] set the stage of this
[1:02:34] the study for this mighty move as the
[1:02:36] aid gave us exploration
[1:02:39] colonization and the printing of books
[1:02:42] which age was that
[1:02:43] the 50th age what was the fifth age
[1:02:45] saddis
[1:02:47] sadist during sadist that's when you saw
[1:02:50] a lot of uh invasions happening
[1:02:54] you know there was the
[1:02:55] colonization took place during the that
[1:02:58] time
[1:02:59] god permitted it by the all this is the
[1:03:00] plan of god don't think that it's
[1:03:02] happening just like that it's all a part
[1:03:04] of god sister richard colonization to
[1:03:07] happen and
[1:03:08] for us to be under the english almost
[1:03:10] half of the world was under the english
[1:03:11] and we learned english language look at
[1:03:13] me speaking english english language yet
[1:03:15] i'm a black man
[1:03:16] from africa
[1:03:18] look at you even sometimes some people
[1:03:20] they behave as if they don't understand
[1:03:22] anything if they don't hear in english
[1:03:24] yet they are black men from african
[1:03:26] women so what am i talking about
[1:03:30] god permitted that because that was
[1:03:32] setting the stage for the open door that
[1:03:35] would come in the age of philadelphia
[1:03:38] this is really good good things for us
[1:03:40] to learn
[1:03:41] the exploration you know you remember
[1:03:43] the explorers
[1:03:45] yes who which explorer do you know
[1:03:53] sansa will baker who else
[1:04:06] was he an expert as well
[1:04:08] okay
[1:04:09] wow
[1:04:10] all right you to expo exploration
[1:04:12] explorers in a in your level of
[1:04:14] education
[1:04:16] sst
[1:04:18] op5 yeah oh yeah yeah you're right
[1:04:20] then we have uh
[1:04:22] the after the explorers
[1:04:24] then comes colonization
[1:04:26] all that happened in service
[1:04:29] service
[1:04:31] yeah we are learning the church ages
[1:04:33] and the church ages involves the history
[1:04:35] of the church
[1:04:36] it involves what happened before so that
[1:04:39] you can know what is happening now
[1:04:41] so we see that then there was
[1:04:44] the age
[1:04:46] of studies and sadis
[1:04:48] in sadness we see the exploration
[1:04:50] happening we see colonization happening
[1:04:53] we see the critical books
[1:04:55] excuse me that's when the printing press
[1:04:57] was invented are you aware you remember
[1:04:59] read about that in studies
[1:05:01] the inversion of the printing press
[1:05:03] actually it is said that it was invented
[1:05:05] for for printing the word because the
[1:05:07] one who invented it even made losses and
[1:05:09] sold it off
[1:05:11] to
[1:05:12] and they used it for printing bibles and
[1:05:14] things
[1:05:14] hallelujah
[1:05:16] so we see
[1:05:17] god allow that to to happen so it can
[1:05:20] set a stage are you following me
[1:05:23] so you can set a stage for what
[1:05:27] for the open door which would come in
[1:05:30] the philadelphia and church age
[1:05:32] now the philosophy of the church age was
[1:05:34] the missionaries
[1:05:36] that's why people wouldn't believe
[1:05:38] christianity they tell you the same
[1:05:40] white man who colonized you is the same
[1:05:43] white man who is coming and now giving
[1:05:45] you the word you have had them select
[1:05:48] that hey the white man is the one who
[1:05:50] brought the gun and killed us and then
[1:05:52] he's now turning coming back again with
[1:05:54] the bible ah and then they think it's a
[1:05:56] white man's gospel no
[1:05:58] it's not a white man's gospel
[1:06:01] if you notice all these messengers not
[1:06:03] all of them are from the same nation
[1:06:06] they've been coming from different areas
[1:06:07] others from germany others from the usa
[1:06:09] others from england others from you
[1:06:11] understand
[1:06:12] from all over
[1:06:14] and when you see as we shall when when
[1:06:16] we finish the pharah buffy and church
[1:06:17] edge and we start laudation
[1:06:20] before we we really go into the depth of
[1:06:22] the of the roundation church eight you
[1:06:24] will notice there was a revival which we
[1:06:26] can call the pentecostal revival
[1:06:29] the azusa street revival
[1:06:31] the time when the holy ghost came down
[1:06:33] and
[1:06:34] filled people at that time
[1:06:37] it was not because but the banham came
[1:06:39] much later after the outpouring of the
[1:06:41] holocaust of azusa street
[1:06:44] excuse me because that happened a
[1:06:45] substitute revival happened in 1906 but
[1:06:48] abandoned was born in 1909
[1:06:54] azusa street revival
[1:06:57] that we're going to study about azusa
[1:06:59] street revival when we finish the
[1:07:01] philadelphia church age i think we shall
[1:07:02] begin with that before we go into the
[1:07:04] radiation church age
[1:07:05] but the azusa street revival started
[1:07:07] because that was the bath in a nutshell
[1:07:10] the bath
[1:07:11] not the drill bath but the rebath
[1:07:13] because it was at the door pentacles
[1:07:15] right but the rebirth of the pentecostal
[1:07:17] movement
[1:07:19] people talking in tongues people praying
[1:07:21] for the sick people praying in the
[1:07:23] spirit people shouting people rolling on
[1:07:25] the floor people healing the sick people
[1:07:26] you understand that kind of thing that
[1:07:28] you know people believing in holiness
[1:07:30] people you know you know believing in
[1:07:32] the real god and leaving god the same
[1:07:34] yes they're doing forever you know that
[1:07:36] kind of move
[1:07:39] in uganda we used to call them up and
[1:07:40] when we went back
[1:07:43] you know papyrus people who were praying
[1:07:46] in papyrus because they didn't have
[1:07:48] well-built churches like the ones that
[1:07:49] the missionaries had built
[1:07:52] so that revival started out in
[1:07:55] but you see if you notice very well as
[1:07:57] we shall see it was also spearheaded by
[1:07:59] a black man
[1:08:01] so it's not like god has forgotten about
[1:08:03] black people
[1:08:04] it was appearing by a black man although
[1:08:06] it was not like a a church edge
[1:08:08] messenger because
[1:08:12] you'll notice that
[1:08:13] that movement was spearheaded his name
[1:08:15] is palm
[1:08:17] palm we read about that
[1:08:20] and so you will see that actually we
[1:08:22] will take that day when we finish the
[1:08:23] elephant church age i want us to take
[1:08:25] like a full day talking about the
[1:08:28] the the azusa street revival because we
[1:08:31] need to know those uh foundations and
[1:08:33] those backgrounds
[1:08:35] and so then after that comes the
[1:08:36] rotation church age and brother banham
[1:08:38] came much later that's why but the
[1:08:39] banham is a not
[1:08:42] a it doesn't bring new things really his
[1:08:45] ministry doesn't bring new things
[1:08:47] because as elijah he is only to tie the
[1:08:50] loose ends together do you know what
[1:08:51] that means
[1:08:52] everything is done you're just going to
[1:08:55] to put it the cake is built the cake is
[1:08:58] rather not beautiful the cake is cooked
[1:09:01] you're just going to do it to put the
[1:09:02] icing
[1:09:04] you understand that's what brother
[1:09:05] bannon does in his ministry as a leader
[1:09:07] because
[1:09:09] everything is restored
[1:09:10] because remember
[1:09:12] matarutha
[1:09:13] brings forth
[1:09:16] restoration but actually it is that
[1:09:18] information but
[1:09:19] he brings the restoration of
[1:09:20] justification by faith alone in christ
[1:09:23] not the church
[1:09:26] and then
[1:09:27] we now come to this age um
[1:09:30] of uh
[1:09:31] philadelphia who's the messenger of
[1:09:32] philadelphia
[1:09:35] john wisley in this age now we see
[1:09:37] another second work of grace coming into
[1:09:39] view as
[1:09:40] in our generation and that is by who
[1:09:45] by who
[1:09:47] who brings this who spirits this
[1:09:49] movement who spirits this revival who
[1:09:51] spearheads this reformation
[1:09:53] or into the second work of grace john
[1:09:56] weasley and what does he talk about
[1:10:01] sanctification
[1:10:03] sanctification
[1:10:09] sanctification by grace yeah through
[1:10:11] grace yes the gift of god right we
[1:10:13] understand the justification comes in by
[1:10:16] rudder martin luther
[1:10:19] then
[1:10:20] john weasley sanctification of course
[1:10:22] then that's when you talk about holiness
[1:10:24] and so these things of ordinance
[1:10:26] teaching ordinance how to dress how to
[1:10:28] you know even appearances and even from
[1:10:30] your heart how to live right and
[1:10:32] repentance
[1:10:34] it is not our doctrine it's not what we
[1:10:36] saw to us we started it was the apostles
[1:10:38] it the roman catholic church
[1:10:39] took out that teaching and that john
[1:10:41] weasley is the one who revived it
[1:10:46] you see
[1:10:47] and and john windsor he was the one who
[1:10:49] you know spared that movement and it
[1:10:52] started other denominations you know
[1:10:54] their problem was to start other
[1:10:56] denominations because whenever they
[1:10:57] started denomination after the movement
[1:11:00] it dies it dies it dies it dies and the
[1:11:02] god continues on moving
[1:11:04] so when luther died the people started
[1:11:07] luther and church
[1:11:09] and they said for us we are lutherans
[1:11:11] meaning they were believing what rudolf
[1:11:13] preached but what did luther preach
[1:11:15] luther only preached justification by
[1:11:17] faith you only preached faith faith
[1:11:19] faith faith you believe not you do but
[1:11:21] you believe just believe all is well
[1:11:23] believe believe believe so you find
[1:11:25] people who are like john calvin john
[1:11:27] calvin took that and he we went
[1:11:29] overboard with it he said no matter what
[1:11:32] you do just go and do whatever you want
[1:11:34] to do no problem as long as you
[1:11:36] believe you see that's now lutheran
[1:11:38] lutheran kind of ideology calvinist it's
[1:11:41] called calvinism you know they just say
[1:11:43] you go and drink your alcohol as long as
[1:11:45] you believe you go and forgive as long
[1:11:48] as you be nothing that can touch your
[1:11:50] soul as long as your soul
[1:11:52] is just have faith in god and no matter
[1:11:56] what you do it doesn't count before god
[1:11:58] ah it feels so nice you know but
[1:12:00] actually that is communism it's only
[1:12:02] going hyper on one direction and doesn't
[1:12:05] balance the gospel you understand
[1:12:08] then god sends another man called
[1:12:11] john wesley now john wiesel is that who
[1:12:13] preaches
[1:12:15] love
[1:12:16] sanctification holiness
[1:12:19] how can you claim to love god how can
[1:12:21] you come to believe in god and you still
[1:12:22] drink you still smoke yourself from
[1:12:24] again you still can be about it
[1:12:26] how would you do would you do that
[1:12:29] and then he brings in this those
[1:12:30] scriptures of john with uh
[1:12:32] of of james show me your faith by your
[1:12:35] works it is by your works and that's why
[1:12:38] he was moving the people and shaking
[1:12:40] them from only believing believing
[1:12:42] believing and continuing doing the wrong
[1:12:43] things
[1:12:44] to believing and doing what you're
[1:12:47] supposed to do that's why the gospel
[1:12:49] during the philadelphia age became a
[1:12:52] doing gospel
[1:12:53] a gospel of what
[1:12:55] that's why you find people they they
[1:12:57] were at that time from 1750 around them
[1:13:02] a man a man like you would come to your
[1:13:04] wife and the children you said dear
[1:13:07] i've had the gospel and i believe it but
[1:13:09] i should not only believe it what am i
[1:13:11] have i done
[1:13:12] i want to go to africa
[1:13:14] you know what it means to go to africa
[1:13:16] even if i tell you to go to karamoja now
[1:13:18] you say oh please that's the punishment
[1:13:21] i want to go to africa and preach the
[1:13:23] gospel to those people in the in the
[1:13:26] woods
[1:13:28] if i don't come back if i die there they
[1:13:31] knew the risks
[1:13:32] if i don't come back and if i die we
[1:13:34] shall meet at jesus's feet
[1:13:37] they would sing a song till we meet
[1:13:40] till we meet
[1:13:42] till we meet at jesus
[1:13:46] deal with me
[1:13:48] the mother would cry the baby would cry
[1:13:50] the children would cry the wife would
[1:13:51] cry the mother man will cry but he said
[1:13:53] i have to go and do what i say i believe
[1:13:55] till we
[1:13:58] meet god be with you till we meet again
[1:14:02] and the man would go and many of them
[1:14:05] incidentally were killed and murdered by
[1:14:07] animals others by people who were
[1:14:10] hostile tribes others you know the
[1:14:12] problems the missionaries found
[1:14:14] even one of them david livingston was
[1:14:16] killed here
[1:14:17] uh you know it is saying was is it the
[1:14:19] one that they said that the king said
[1:14:21] that uh
[1:14:23] and
[1:14:24] the other one thought that
[1:14:25] he meant
[1:14:27] you know because muhammad means to
[1:14:28] release him and
[1:14:30] means to kill him so the other ones i
[1:14:33] think he was in saga they said
[1:14:36] the others they said they thought that
[1:14:38] he meant
[1:14:40] and they killed the man see so many of
[1:14:42] them were killed that way all because of
[1:14:45] the love they had in their hearts to go
[1:14:48] and
[1:14:49] take the gospel
[1:14:50] that's how you see how the bible society
[1:14:52] was even also inaugurated and many other
[1:14:54] you know things because they had this
[1:14:56] love within them to go they would come
[1:14:58] here build schools they would come here
[1:15:01] the germans those germany missionaries
[1:15:02] all those people they would come here
[1:15:05] forget about their home and leave here
[1:15:07] with the people
[1:15:08] build hospitals build the schools build
[1:15:11] and be here to live the gospel not only
[1:15:13] to preach it but leave it
[1:15:15] you see so therefore it's not us who
[1:15:18] started preaching works that we believe
[1:15:22] also in the works it was that was the
[1:15:24] second work of grace sanctification
[1:15:26] which was actually
[1:15:28] in the gospel of john wisley who was the
[1:15:30] fifth church age messenger the fifth or
[1:15:32] the sixth
[1:15:33] the sixth actually the different church
[1:15:35] age
[1:15:36] and then after that then came their
[1:15:39] pentecostal movement over to street
[1:15:40] revival now that they believed in the
[1:15:43] holy ghost the gifts of if you claim you
[1:15:46] are believers the real believers and you
[1:15:49] have been justified and you have been
[1:15:51] sanctified
[1:15:52] where is the power of god in your midst
[1:15:55] where is the power of god
[1:15:57] you see they were hungering and fasting
[1:15:59] for that and god gave it to them the
[1:16:01] power of god
[1:16:02] the gifts came down in abundance they
[1:16:05] would even talking tanks this was before
[1:16:07] but abandoned even came on the scene
[1:16:10] you see and but abandoned comes much
[1:16:12] later
[1:16:13] much like 20 years later to start the
[1:16:16] ministry
[1:16:17] and he found already when they were
[1:16:18] already manipulated the coast was
[1:16:20] movements times and waters already
[1:16:21] happening but when his ministry started
[1:16:24] it was very different because his
[1:16:25] minister that the end time elijah was to
[1:16:28] restore to tie the loose ends together
[1:16:30] huh
[1:16:31] the teachings already everything is
[1:16:32] already there but now he needs to put it
[1:16:34] everything in line
[1:16:37] what was left to tell you people just
[1:16:39] clean up yeah okay now he's like a
[1:16:41] supervisor you know you already cleaned
[1:16:42] he's coming for you and do that huh
[1:16:45] yeah and that's what this message is
[1:16:47] doing hallelujah so we are not
[1:16:49] demonizing others we are simply saying
[1:16:51] we have received perfection now
[1:16:54] you get a point
[1:16:55] so
[1:16:57] um
[1:16:58] that is it it's a very good study by the
[1:17:00] way we have done
[1:17:01] that on that line if you really look at
[1:17:03] it in that direction oh my it just opens
[1:17:06] your heart and
[1:17:07] you are able to see many many things in
[1:17:09] the word of god and in history what has
[1:17:11] been happening over the ages
[1:17:14] did i give out any parts but abandoned
[1:17:15] then he gives his testimony of the
[1:17:17] muhammadan
[1:17:18] and i was that muhammad and god was able
[1:17:21] to receive christ because she
[1:17:24] uh accepted
[1:17:26] to be to to see the living messiah
[1:17:29] actually this the edge of the open door
[1:17:31] meaning that god makes an open door for
[1:17:33] you and no man is you can dare to shout
[1:17:36] it
[1:17:37] may god give us that open door even us
[1:17:40] even now so that we can be able to
[1:17:41] preach this message without fear of
[1:17:43] favor and leave it not only preach it
[1:17:44] but leave it that's the best preaching
[1:17:47] you can ever do so i'd like us to unless
[1:17:49] you there's a question and i'd like us
[1:17:51] to proceed
[1:17:52] with uh the listening that we have been
[1:17:54] doing
[1:18:09] yes can you do it for us and then you
[1:18:11] ask your question
[1:18:17] have you seen that portion
[1:18:23] okay read it
[1:18:39] about all the cities and villages
[1:18:42] teaching in their synagogues and
[1:18:43] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[1:18:45] healing every sickness and every disease
[1:18:47] among the people but when he saw them
[1:18:50] attitudes he was moved with compassion
[1:18:52] from them because they fainted and we
[1:18:55] are scattered abroad as sheep having no
[1:18:58] shepherd then say he and to his
[1:19:01] disciples
[1:19:02] the harvest truly is plain tears but the
[1:19:05] laborers are few
[1:19:06] pray he therefore the lord of the
[1:19:09] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[1:19:12] into his habits
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:16] many people have the idea that just the
[1:19:18] apostles at this ministry give given
[1:19:21] them by our lord jesus and so when they
[1:19:24] died the ministry was over that is not
[1:19:27] so here is luke chapter 10 verse 1 to 9.
[1:19:31] we find that in the days of
[1:19:33] of his acne sojourn
[1:19:36] he had already started to give
[1:19:39] ministries of power to his own after
[1:19:42] these things the lord appointed other 70
[1:19:45] also and sent them to and
[1:19:48] before his face into every city and
[1:19:50] place
[1:19:51] whether he himself would come
[1:19:54] there are four said he unto them they
[1:19:57] have destroyed is great but the laborers
[1:19:59] are few pray therefore the lord of the
[1:20:02] harvest that he would send forth
[1:20:04] liberating his harvest
[1:20:07] go your ways behold i send you forth as
[1:20:10] lambs among wolves
[1:20:13] carry neither personal scrape your shoes
[1:20:16] and salute no man by dave
[1:20:19] and
[1:20:20] into whatsoever house he had
[1:20:22] first said peace be to his this house
[1:20:26] and if the son of the peace be there
[1:20:30] your peace shall rest upon it and
[1:20:33] if not it shall turn to you again
[1:20:37] so my question was about deliverance yes
[1:20:45] yeah it says that the harvest is truly
[1:20:47] great or plenty us but the laborers are
[1:20:51] a few now brother the laborers here is
[1:20:54] talking about the preachers
[1:20:56] he's talking about the people who are
[1:20:58] going out who go out in the field to
[1:21:00] preach
[1:21:01] and those who do that are the laborers
[1:21:03] we are the laborers we are laboring
[1:21:06] laboring is
[1:21:07] to
[1:21:09] go out and carry the gospel the weight
[1:21:11] of the gospel to the people
[1:21:13] so those are deliverers
[1:21:15] so
[1:21:15] the field is the harvest is great
[1:21:18] meaning
[1:21:20] the people who need the gospel are there
[1:21:22] and there are so many
[1:21:24] but the laborers are few
[1:21:26] but those people who are ready to
[1:21:28] sacrifice everything
[1:21:30] and commit their lives to go
[1:21:33] and preach for the sake of the gospel
[1:21:35] they are few
[1:21:36] they are few
[1:21:38] and indeed it is true
[1:21:41] tell me
[1:21:42] how many within how many families have
[1:21:44] you seen
[1:21:45] someone saying one of the children
[1:21:47] saying well me i want to serve god
[1:21:50] if you ask every one of them what do you
[1:21:52] want to do what do you want do i do you
[1:21:53] want to everybody i want to be a doctor
[1:21:55] i want to be a
[1:21:59] what an engineer i want to be
[1:22:01] i want to be i want to be a policeman i
[1:22:04] want to be a soldier
[1:22:06] no one wants to be a preacher
[1:22:09] everybody's running away from it
[1:22:11] that's why when god wants to call you he
[1:22:13] arrests you when you're still young
[1:22:16] some of us could not be able to escape
[1:22:18] it
[1:22:19] when he arrested us we tried to run away
[1:22:22] but we couldn't you see
[1:22:25] so the laborers are few
[1:22:28] and they said pray
[1:22:30] either for the lord of the harvest that
[1:22:32] he would send forth laborers
[1:22:34] into his
[1:22:35] field harvest
[1:22:37] okay so and then he says go away i send
[1:22:40] you
[1:22:41] i send you islams among wolves
[1:22:44] don't think it is easy whenever we go
[1:22:45] out to preach the gospel to introduce
[1:22:47] the message to the people it's not easy
[1:22:49] when you go to talk about jesus among
[1:22:51] the people you become the enemy of the
[1:22:54] society
[1:22:55] it's not easy never think that when you
[1:22:56] go out to preach everybody's just going
[1:22:58] to accept me ah thank you for coming hey
[1:23:01] others can even abuse you others can do
[1:23:03] whatever they want to do against you
[1:23:04] when you talk about the word
[1:23:06] they just don't waste our time look at
[1:23:08] you now you're just wasting your life
[1:23:10] how old are you even you see they think
[1:23:12] they have this mentality that only all
[1:23:14] the men of 50 60 should preach why
[1:23:17] because they think they have nothing to
[1:23:18] do you know
[1:23:20] no
[1:23:21] me i started preaching when i was 13 and
[1:23:23] since then i never stopped until now and
[1:23:25] i will continue until
[1:23:27] i become 90.
[1:23:29] if the lord gives me a long life you see
[1:23:31] because i believe it's not the gospel is
[1:23:33] not only for the young the gospel is not
[1:23:35] only for the old the gospel is for the
[1:23:37] young and old as long as you are labor
[1:23:39] and god has sent you into the field you
[1:23:41] go and preach it not very many people
[1:23:44] are proud of their children if they
[1:23:46] decide to preach the word you know
[1:23:49] but let me tell you
[1:23:50] when god
[1:23:51] calls a laborer when god calls you to
[1:23:53] labor in his vineyard in whichever way
[1:23:56] it may not only be preaching you find
[1:23:58] that this missionaries when they were
[1:23:59] going out they had people who were there
[1:24:01] like doctors actually many of these
[1:24:03] missionaries were doctors themselves
[1:24:06] they like who like who
[1:24:09] they do
[1:24:12] was a doctor
[1:24:13] and albert cook
[1:24:15] even here he started a hospital here huh
[1:24:17] man goes peter so many of these were
[1:24:19] doctors
[1:24:21] a man he has his own profession he's
[1:24:23] earning money but he decided he says let
[1:24:24] me go and serve the lord not only in
[1:24:27] scripture but also in my career
[1:24:32] there you are
[1:24:34] so if you have a career if you think you
[1:24:37] do you should use it for the glory of
[1:24:38] god and be a laborer in the field of the
[1:24:41] lord
[1:24:42] hallelujah that is a big challenge now
[1:24:45] huh you are the one who brought it out
[1:24:47] may have knocked it out you see so you
[1:24:50] you need to to pray about being a
[1:24:52] laborer in the field you see
[1:24:54] you know
[1:24:55] if you know for example you were in the
[1:24:57] church and you were serving the lord
[1:24:58] with something
[1:25:00] these days young people do it for pay
[1:25:02] can you imagine
[1:25:03] they go to church to play piano for pay
[1:25:06] they go to to sing for pray
[1:25:09] they go to can you imagine they have
[1:25:12] they have tried to make the gospel
[1:25:16] business yes
[1:25:18] they have tried to make it like
[1:25:19] merchandise they're merchandising the
[1:25:21] gospel
[1:25:22] you know
[1:25:25] employment opportunity
[1:25:27] i will go be a you know cut a pastor's
[1:25:30] bag for money
[1:25:31] i will go you know oh dear the world is
[1:25:35] rotten rotten completely yet this gospel
[1:25:38] is dripping with blood there are people
[1:25:40] who give their own lives for the sake of
[1:25:42] what they believed in to be the truth
[1:25:44] so really
[1:25:46] these days we find young people because
[1:25:47] after all i don't get any payment of
[1:25:49] charge i'm just there you know i'm just
[1:25:51] doing it by my own free will so i can do
[1:25:54] whenever i want and whenever i don't
[1:25:55] want i can run away i don't even need to
[1:25:57] you know
[1:25:58] that's not right you know i remember me
[1:26:01] when i started serving the lord in the
[1:26:03] church of course i never got anything
[1:26:05] from the church but i was doing it with
[1:26:07] all my heart
[1:26:09] i started with the praying just praying
[1:26:11] for the for the believers i would just
[1:26:13] be there evident i need to pray for them
[1:26:15] from there i said the song some reading
[1:26:17] you know someone reading
[1:26:19] maybe one of you god can use you to some
[1:26:21] read you know i started some reading you
[1:26:23] know
[1:26:24] and when i started the song reading
[1:26:26] i was song reading
[1:26:28] not for money
[1:26:30] and i was always there
[1:26:31] okay
[1:26:33] i was i was sure
[1:26:35] that i would be there
[1:26:37] not for the pastor not for the church
[1:26:39] but for my god for the sake of my god
[1:26:42] and i would do it i was always there
[1:26:44] and then from there i became a preacher
[1:26:46] and i was always there i would preach
[1:26:48] almost three four times a day when i was
[1:26:50] a young man you know 15 years for 16 17.
[1:26:54] three or four times a week you know and
[1:26:55] i'm at school
[1:26:57] you know sometimes i would even i'm not
[1:26:59] ready to do that but i'd rather even
[1:27:00] escape at school to go and preach you
[1:27:02] know and god was with me he gave me
[1:27:05] grace because i had this zeal within my
[1:27:06] heart i want to serve god
[1:27:08] you understand
[1:27:10] so
[1:27:12] there is always
[1:27:13] you know you find even
[1:27:15] not only
[1:27:17] women men also men women they need a lot
[1:27:21] to be able to
[1:27:23] to be laborers in the field for example
[1:27:26] when you see jesus in his ministry never
[1:27:28] chose
[1:27:29] um women to be among the 12 disciples
[1:27:33] but yet
[1:27:34] in his ministry you find women there
[1:27:37] helping
[1:27:39] the bible doesn't document them a lot
[1:27:40] but
[1:27:42] like mary magdalene she was always going
[1:27:44] where he was going you know she was
[1:27:45] delivered
[1:27:46] like mary like uh
[1:27:48] salome also there are several women well
[1:27:51] in the municipal there were women all
[1:27:53] around
[1:27:54] sometimes
[1:27:55] yeah
[1:27:58] also you know but you know the women
[1:28:01] have always been there laboring for
[1:28:04] the
[1:28:05] lord you understand
[1:28:07] you see laboring for the lord does not
[1:28:08] necessarily mean preaching going there
[1:28:10] to preach i'm going to be a powerful
[1:28:12] preacher so i can never for the lord
[1:28:14] necessarily it doesn't mean that way
[1:28:15] even if you're a man or a woman
[1:28:17] laboring for the lord
[1:28:19] means to yield your life and give it for
[1:28:22] the service of the lord whatever you can
[1:28:24] do
[1:28:25] for another person for the sake of the
[1:28:28] lord is laboring for the lord you
[1:28:30] understand
[1:28:31] sometimes it may be giving money
[1:28:33] sometimes it may be helping someone in
[1:28:35] need sometimes maybe praying for the
[1:28:38] pastor praying for the preacher so you
[1:28:40] know you just said me you know no one
[1:28:41] has told me but i'm going to be praying
[1:28:43] every day
[1:28:44] for 20 minutes or 15 or 10 or 5 whatever
[1:28:46] or whenever before i go to bed i want to
[1:28:48] give something i want to pray for the
[1:28:50] ministry you do it that's laboring for
[1:28:52] the lord
[1:28:53] you see
[1:28:54] you can say me i'm always going to be
[1:28:56] the one to buy the water that the
[1:28:58] preacher will preach we will be drinking
[1:29:01] i'm going to always do it you know you
[1:29:03] don't even have the money but it's the
[1:29:04] law they provide me you don't promise
[1:29:06] anyone but they always see you bringing
[1:29:07] it by paying this is for water this is
[1:29:10] for water you see
[1:29:12] another one there are many ways of
[1:29:15] laboring for the lord
[1:29:16] you see me i'll always sweep the chat i
[1:29:18] will always do it i don't need anyone
[1:29:20] tell me i'll always go you know
[1:29:23] that is laboring for the lord our all is
[1:29:25] witness i always tell others
[1:29:27] there's always something that you can do
[1:29:29] every time to labor for the lord it is a
[1:29:31] lot that we can do
[1:29:33] in labor for our god

[1:29:46] cover that
[1:29:47] okay what is it about
[1:29:51] yes don't worry about where where money
[1:29:54] will come from don't worry about where
[1:29:56] shoes will come from don't worry about
[1:29:58] where that will come from god is another
[1:29:59] one saying i will take care of you
[1:30:05] it means do not waste your time in the
[1:30:08] the things of the world you know you see
[1:30:10] you said that let's say i am going to to
[1:30:14] to to to the shop and then before you
[1:30:16] reach the shop you find your friend
[1:30:18] my friend
[1:30:22] don't go in nonsense
[1:30:24] if you have a vision and a mission even
[1:30:26] in your own life
[1:30:27] don't waste it with the people of no
[1:30:29] value
[1:30:32] don't rest it in things with things of
[1:30:34] no value
[1:30:35] you see for me when i want to talk i
[1:30:37] talk to when i begin talking to you you
[1:30:39] may think this one has nothing to do
[1:30:40] because i'm realizing in my heart there
[1:30:43] is a value in talking to you
[1:30:45] me i don't talk to people with with
[1:30:47] nobody if i realize this one this seed
[1:30:49] there is no seed of god in their heart i
[1:30:51] don't even waste my time i don't even
[1:30:53] waste my time
[1:30:54] you see
[1:30:55] whether they give me money or not i
[1:30:56] don't waste i don't want i want to waste
[1:30:59] my time it will not be wasting i want to
[1:31:01] spend my time
[1:31:03] on
[1:31:04] the vision and the mission that god has
[1:31:06] given me what is it
[1:31:08] what is it
[1:31:10] to be a laborer
[1:31:12] and if i'm going to be a laborer what
[1:31:13] does the master want to see he finished
[1:31:14] the building so i don't have time to
[1:31:17] waste any greeting and talking and doing
[1:31:18] this he doesn't certainly greet people
[1:31:21] by the way
[1:31:23] don't interpret these things literally
[1:31:25] because you will begin becoming proud
[1:31:28] you are not a great
[1:31:36] it means that we barefoot
[1:31:38] even not get clothes do you just be you
[1:31:41] know that's not what he means but he he
[1:31:44] instead means you say don't waste your
[1:31:46] time in worrying where the money for
[1:31:48] those things will come from or wasting
[1:31:50] your time
[1:31:51] with them
[1:31:53] if you want a change to come to you you
[1:31:55] even have to change your connections
[1:31:57] this is what i did myself
[1:31:59] if you want to go to change you if you
[1:32:00] want to go to work on you if you want to
[1:32:02] go to take you to another level then you
[1:32:04] have to get yourself out of the place
[1:32:06] where you are like you told abram get
[1:32:08] out of the place where you are
[1:32:09] if your friends won't change then change
[1:32:11] them
[1:32:12] you get a point check them get other
[1:32:14] friends
[1:32:15] you know if your friends won't see what
[1:32:18] you you see
[1:32:19] then get others who will see what you
[1:32:20] say keep yourself around good influence
[1:32:23] keep yourself around good influence so
[1:32:25] that you can be able to influence others
[1:32:28] but if you have the influence around you
[1:32:30] is negative negative bad bad you will
[1:32:33] also be in that kind that kind of thing
[1:32:36] you know this is what they call memes
[1:32:37] these days
[1:32:39] i didn't even know who was it was it you
[1:32:41] or someone i don't know i think it was
[1:32:43] someone else uh there's a young man who
[1:32:45] posted it on a what's up
[1:32:47] and they said what is this now he said
[1:32:49] our pastor is just a meme sounds like
[1:32:52] what do you mean by a man what does that
[1:32:53] mean
[1:32:54] i don't even know what a name is you
[1:32:56] know honestly even now i'm here to study
[1:32:59] on it what does that mean
[1:33:01] meme he said even
[1:33:04] good luck
[1:33:05] i didn't realize that now i'm growing up
[1:33:07] i thought i was young
[1:33:09] you see
[1:33:10] that the influence in this generation is
[1:33:12] so big you know you are around people
[1:33:15] all the time
[1:33:16] posting memes it may no means
[1:33:18] and you're also very visiting memes
[1:33:21] wasting valuable time
[1:33:24] wasting valuable time you find that
[1:33:26] what you are doing is what they are
[1:33:27] doing because you are in their society
[1:33:29] in their
[1:33:30] web
[1:33:31] let me tell you if you want to go to
[1:33:33] about something
[1:33:34] be in the web of people that have
[1:33:37] already amounted to something so that
[1:33:39] you too can be like them you will always
[1:33:41] realize you become like the people you
[1:33:43] are around
[1:33:44] always you dress like them you talk like
[1:33:46] them you'll behave like them you will do
[1:33:48] the things they do even when you don't
[1:33:50] want to do them if you are around
[1:33:51] friends who always smoke weed
[1:33:54] you you a christian but for them they
[1:33:55] smoke
[1:33:56] like their nose and the other thing you
[1:33:59] you you when you say that in the first
[1:34:00] day
[1:34:01] oh you didn't run and then next time
[1:34:04] because they are still your friends you
[1:34:06] know you will go around them again and
[1:34:07] then you realize again they smoke
[1:34:09] puffing it and then you're like
[1:34:11] by the way
[1:34:12] okay you received and you ran away then
[1:34:14] again you see at the third time
[1:34:16] when you see the fact by the way even
[1:34:18] the way it happens it looks
[1:34:20] yeah elegant why don't i try it out you
[1:34:23] know so the devil will keep on pulling
[1:34:25] you pulling you're trapping you and the
[1:34:27] moment it helps you
[1:34:29] to come out of that trap
[1:34:31] it will take the buddhas of the holy
[1:34:32] ghost to get you out so that's why it's
[1:34:35] very good for us to keep ourselves
[1:34:37] around with a good
[1:34:40] type of influence yes
[1:34:42] all right so shall we now continue
[1:34:45] we have only about 30 minutes to close
[1:34:48] when he says
[1:34:51] muhammadan
[1:34:54] yes
[1:34:54] he means the muslims
[1:34:56] yes this was a muslim guy who got
[1:34:59] delivered and many of them muslims were
[1:35:02] delivered
[1:35:04] yes
[1:35:06] any more questions
[1:35:14] you see jesus did not only have twelve
[1:35:16] disciples
[1:35:18] after the twelve you only had children
[1:35:19] that you also had chosen the servant who
[1:35:22] were following him
[1:35:23] those servants also left him
[1:35:26] at one point when he told them the one
[1:35:28] who doesn't drink my fresh
[1:35:31] blood and drink and eat my flesh they
[1:35:33] also left
[1:35:34] it was only the twelve who remained so
[1:35:37] the twitter weather of the one of the
[1:35:38] inner inner circle and the seventy were
[1:35:40] the ones of the outer circle and the
[1:35:42] magnitude was the one of the outer
[1:35:43] outside circle
[1:35:46] so you find that you can only remain
[1:35:48] with the christ if you have the inner
[1:35:49] inner circle if you truly believe this
[1:35:51] word so he sent us
[1:35:55] yes at one time he sent them out
[1:35:57] to go and they prayed and they the
[1:36:00] demons came out of people and they oh
[1:36:02] they came back rejoicing hallelujah we
[1:36:04] chased up demons and they all they were
[1:36:07] listening to us
[1:36:09] and then jesus told them
[1:36:11] don't rejoice because demons are hearing
[1:36:13] you but just because your name is on the
[1:36:15] book
[1:36:17] and then your other question will be i
[1:36:18] know so you mean their names was on the
[1:36:20] book of life said yes their names were
[1:36:22] but their names were removed
[1:36:24] you see because they did not stay with
[1:36:27] the world
[1:36:29] not
[1:36:31] on the book of life
[1:36:35] on the lamb's book of life
[1:36:39] on the book of life of the lamb
[1:36:42] which the which which the lamb purchased
[1:36:45] and bought
[1:36:46] and your name cannot be removed
[1:36:49] but then why
[1:36:51] why is your name removed from the book
[1:36:52] of life yet it means nothing
[1:36:56] okay let me explain
[1:36:59] there are certain people
[1:37:01] whose names are on the book of life that
[1:37:03] are going to be saved
[1:37:04] but they will not be in the bride
[1:37:07] yes
[1:37:08] so
[1:37:09] but those people
[1:37:11] will be saved but they will be judged
[1:37:14] they will be in the judgment
[1:37:18] they are not a bright and they and they
[1:37:20] will be in the judgment because they
[1:37:21] will be judged according to their works
[1:37:26] you get a point
[1:37:27] but the bride is not judged according to
[1:37:29] her works the bride is judged according
[1:37:31] to
[1:37:32] his what
[1:37:35] he's
[1:37:36] works you got the point
[1:37:38] but the rest are judged according to
[1:37:41] their works that they had how that they
[1:37:43] did in their life
[1:37:45] time on earth that's why their names are
[1:37:48] on the book of life
[1:37:50] as long as they had life there are
[1:37:52] certain things they did and those things
[1:37:54] once they did they will be judged
[1:37:56] according to those works
[1:37:58] but the bride is not going to stand
[1:37:59] before the white throne judgment did you
[1:38:01] know that brother joe
[1:38:02] the bride will not because our judgment
[1:38:05] is here that is there for now no
[1:38:06] condemnation to those that are in christ
[1:38:08] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:38:10] the spirit so there is no way we can
[1:38:11] come into the judgment because we have
[1:38:13] already passed from judgment and to life
[1:38:15] so the white throne judgment will be
[1:38:17] there
[1:38:18] we
[1:38:19] are only going to stand before the
[1:38:21] judgment seat of christ
[1:38:24] even if we shall not go before the white
[1:38:25] throne judgment but we shall we shall be
[1:38:28] before the judgment seat of christ to
[1:38:30] give accountability for how we lived our
[1:38:32] lives okay
[1:38:33] yes
[1:38:34] even those ones who are going to excuse
[1:38:36] me
[1:38:37] to to not go in before the white front
[1:38:39] judgment and even those who are going to
[1:38:41] be ruptured they will have to give
[1:38:42] account my dear you see don't think that
[1:38:45] you are all going to be like equal like
[1:38:47] equal as in be the same i will say here
[1:38:49] on earth
[1:38:52] i don't think we are going to be we are
[1:38:54] going to have different glories even up
[1:38:56] there you see according to what we did
[1:38:59] yes
[1:39:00] but remember
[1:39:01] not
[1:39:04] not whether life or death
[1:39:06] that's not a question for us there
[1:39:08] because we all have life
[1:39:11] equal we will all have life
[1:39:13] but
[1:39:14] we shall
[1:39:15] go before the judgment seat of christ to
[1:39:18] give an account on how we lived our
[1:39:20] lives
[1:39:21] you get a point
[1:39:22] but the rest of the christians and human
[1:39:26] beings and whatever it is that their
[1:39:28] names are in the book of life they will
[1:39:29] stand before the
[1:39:31] white throne judgment
[1:39:33] and they will give an account
[1:39:37] of why they refuse their blood
[1:39:40] they will have to explain their actions
[1:39:43] for what
[1:39:45] to be counted worthy for life
[1:39:47] or not
[1:39:50] so
[1:39:51] for us it's not like we are preparing
[1:39:53] ourselves to
[1:39:55] go to the white throne judgment no we
[1:39:57] are preparing ourselves to go in the
[1:39:58] rapture
[1:39:59] and from there when we come back the
[1:40:01] next time we come back down on earth we
[1:40:03] are going to go in the millennium and
[1:40:04] that's a time of rejoicing and one it's
[1:40:06] going to be a wonderful time and from
[1:40:08] there then they were throwing judgement
[1:40:10] you see so it's a it's a beautiful
[1:40:13] picture there
[1:40:14] i think i'll need to talk about that
[1:40:15] subject more in the church because i
[1:40:17] noticed you people needed more
[1:40:18] information on that okay um any more
[1:40:22] question
[1:40:29] the white throne judgment
[1:40:32] is not for the bride
[1:40:35] let me give you a timeline
[1:40:37] right now what is the bride waiting for
[1:40:42] for the rapture
[1:40:43] so after the rapture
[1:40:46] then
[1:40:47] comes the millennium of course i've not
[1:40:49] talked about the tribulation because the
[1:40:50] tribulation happens at the same time as
[1:40:52] the rapture
[1:40:54] when the rapture goes sets forth
[1:40:57] the world is in the tribulation
[1:41:00] you understand
[1:41:02] and when we come out of the great
[1:41:04] tribulation it's going to be the great
[1:41:05] tribulation
[1:41:07] the the in the great tribulation that's
[1:41:08] when the 144 thousand jews will be saved
[1:41:14] now
[1:41:16] after the tribulation
[1:41:18] after
[1:41:19] the three years and a half of the
[1:41:21] rapture of the marriage top of the lamp
[1:41:24] what will come then
[1:41:28] nope
[1:41:29] then there will come the millennium
[1:41:33] now
[1:41:34] the millennium of course there are other
[1:41:35] things i'm skipping not to confuse you
[1:41:37] to give many details like the armageddon
[1:41:39] and blah blah blah
[1:41:40] because the armageddon is the third
[1:41:42] world war which is going to happen after
[1:41:44] the rapture it will be
[1:41:48] happening
[1:41:49] and it will be stopped by god himself
[1:41:52] ah the tribulation
[1:41:54] it will be the climax of the tribulation
[1:41:58] then comes after that after all those
[1:42:01] things then comes a new heaven and a new
[1:42:04] earth uh rather not at that point
[1:42:07] because then remember
[1:42:09] after the rapture then the tribulation
[1:42:11] and all those things then the this earth
[1:42:15] will be destroyed
[1:42:17] okay
[1:42:18] the elements will melt
[1:42:20] but remember it is this same earth
[1:42:24] which
[1:42:25] has
[1:42:26] to cover the bride and the bridegroom
[1:42:28] for their honeymoon
[1:42:30] now
[1:42:31] notice
[1:42:33] during that time the earth will be
[1:42:35] prepared actually the third world one
[1:42:37] all those kind of things which will
[1:42:38] happen on this earth it will prepare
[1:42:39] this earth
[1:42:41] for the millennium
[1:42:43] almost all human beings will be
[1:42:45] annihilated
[1:42:47] there will be only a remnant a few which
[1:42:49] shall remain
[1:42:51] those ones which are remain will be the
[1:42:53] ones to the lean they will be the ones
[1:42:56] to populate the earth repopulate the
[1:42:58] earth and the earth will be filled with
[1:42:59] people again
[1:43:02] right now
[1:43:06] the people
[1:43:07] which people
[1:43:17] that's before judgment
[1:43:19] that's before judgment because remember
[1:43:22] that they are destroyed and others
[1:43:24] remain
[1:43:26] and and um and uh
[1:43:28] you know when they remain
[1:43:30] that's when the city of god comes down
[1:43:33] and the bride
[1:43:36] with the bride will begin to rule on
[1:43:38] this world with a bridegroom are you
[1:43:40] following me
[1:43:42] now the bridegroom who is the bridegroom
[1:43:44] jesus christ the bible said that he will
[1:43:46] rule with a lot of iron for especially
[1:43:49] over a thousand years
[1:43:51] now
[1:43:53] the thousand years
[1:43:54] rule or reign of jesus christ on this
[1:43:57] earth
[1:44:00] we shall be ruling over what
[1:44:04] exactly we shall be ruling over them
[1:44:07] i'm imagining
[1:44:09] if you have made a king
[1:44:11] and after being made a king then you are
[1:44:14] a king of the desert with nothing how
[1:44:16] does it feel
[1:44:20] would you rather have i think you would
[1:44:22] rather be a king of the desert
[1:44:24] imagine you are king and you are king of
[1:44:25] the desert nothing is there
[1:44:27] we would have to be
[1:44:29] king and queen
[1:44:30] of the whole world populated with people
[1:44:33] these people will be giving back and
[1:44:36] having children
[1:44:37] these people will be
[1:44:39] on this earth
[1:44:41] and and the only thing that you want to
[1:44:43] be there is sin because there will not
[1:44:46] be the devil will be bound a thousand
[1:44:47] years
[1:44:49] and you shall be ruling over those
[1:44:50] people
[1:44:53] yes and we shall be appearing and
[1:44:54] disappear
[1:44:56] because that's the ability which we lost
[1:44:58] so we shall have it then
[1:44:59] you know
[1:45:00] and imagine if i want to go to
[1:45:03] america just disappear and appear i want
[1:45:05] to go to
[1:45:06] whatever and then you know i'm imagining
[1:45:10] there will be a lot of things that will
[1:45:11] be explained then
[1:45:13] they're lying on the calf i mean the the
[1:45:15] the child the bible says would sit with
[1:45:18] a lion you know
[1:45:21] we will be with animals as if we are
[1:45:24] brothers and sisters no problem we shall
[1:45:26] be back in that time when adam was
[1:45:27] ruling over them we shall be like ruling
[1:45:29] now over the world the world like it is
[1:45:31] supposed to be
[1:45:33] you can't fear anything now even the
[1:45:35] lion will just be petting it no problem
[1:45:37] they will be the ones in the in the
[1:45:39] throne room
[1:45:40] you understand
[1:45:41] and then that's the millennium but then
[1:45:44] after the millennium the bible says that
[1:45:45] these people
[1:45:47] after one thousand years
[1:45:49] the devil was losed and when he was
[1:45:50] loosed
[1:45:55] and he write to them that you go and
[1:45:57] destroy the city
[1:45:58] and when they went to destroy the city
[1:46:00] the bible says fire came from above
[1:46:02] and and they divided all of them
[1:46:05] finished them up
[1:46:07] and then shortly after that bible says
[1:46:09] and there was a great big
[1:46:10] resurrection of every living being that
[1:46:13] has ever lived
[1:46:19] as in the bride
[1:46:33] i'm yet to study more about that i don't
[1:46:35] know
[1:46:36] some of those many many details is not
[1:46:38] really you know there are many things
[1:46:40] about that that we do not know because
[1:46:42] he wants us to get it as a surprise so i
[1:46:45] don't think even when you are going to
[1:46:47] for honeymoon and for our you want to
[1:46:49] leave some little bit of a surprise for
[1:46:50] your wife you know so i'm sure that
[1:46:52] they'll leave some of those beats for us
[1:46:54] as a surprise we'll get it there we will
[1:46:56] get to know brother
[1:46:57] i'll look for you and i think now you
[1:46:59] see they are not dying or they are dying
[1:47:01] whichever it is
[1:47:02] so then we realized that uh then when
[1:47:05] they
[1:47:06] then that's after the 1000 years reign
[1:47:09] with christ that's when we shall now be
[1:47:12] on this earth
[1:47:15] to see the judgment seat rather the
[1:47:18] white throne judgment being
[1:47:20] set for the judgment
[1:47:23] of both modern great rich and poor
[1:47:26] for all those who ever lived on earth
[1:47:29] and whatever it is
[1:47:32] that
[1:47:33] they did he will be judged them then the
[1:47:36] bride will not be before the throne the
[1:47:38] bride will be behind the throne with the
[1:47:40] judge
[1:47:42] you get a point
[1:47:43] so that's how it's going to be
[1:47:48] oh you want to read it in the bible
[1:47:51] okay
[1:47:53] so you can see we are not continuing the
[1:47:55] philadelphia church else today
[1:47:57] go to the book of revelation
[1:48:01] oh sister rachel was like man this is a
[1:48:03] beautiful story but is it even in the
[1:48:05] bible
[1:48:08] all right let's go to revelations
[1:48:10] chapter 21 i believe it is
[1:48:14] no chapter 20.
[1:48:18] i think it's more self-explanatory
[1:48:22] and i saw an angel come down from heaven
[1:48:24] having a key of the bottomless pit with
[1:48:27] a great chain in his hand and he laid a
[1:48:29] hold on the dragon that old serpent
[1:48:31] which is the devil and saturn and bound
[1:48:33] him a thousand years and cast him into
[1:48:35] the bottomless pit and shot him and set
[1:48:38] a seal upon him that he should deceive
[1:48:39] the nations no more until the thousand
[1:48:41] years should be fulfilled and after that
[1:48:44] he must be ruled a little season that
[1:48:45] little season when he's going to be
[1:48:47] loosed i told you of it already
[1:48:49] and i saw thrones and they sat upon them
[1:48:51] and judgments was given unto them and i
[1:48:53] saw the souls of them that were beheaded
[1:48:55] for the witness of jesus and for the
[1:48:57] world for the word of god which which
[1:48:59] had not worshipped the beast neither his
[1:49:02] image neither had received his mark upon
[1:49:04] their foreheads or in their hands and
[1:49:06] they lived and reigned with the christ a
[1:49:07] thousand years okay the 144 thousand
[1:49:10] jews and
[1:49:12] the the bride they ruled and reigned
[1:49:14] with christ a thousand years
[1:49:16] but the rest of the day lived not again
[1:49:18] until the thousand years we have
[1:49:20] finished this is the first resurrection
[1:49:21] so now we notice that the first
[1:49:23] resurrection is the one of those that
[1:49:26] lived and reigned with the christ okay
[1:49:29] in the first resurrection the first one
[1:49:30] is the first resurrection
[1:49:34] hmm
[1:49:39] yes that's the first resurrection but uh
[1:49:42] but the rest of the thousands the rest
[1:49:44] of the dead did not come up in the first
[1:49:46] result they remained dead
[1:49:48] they had they come in a great
[1:49:50] resurrection another one the second
[1:49:52] resurrection
[1:49:54] blessed are the holy is he that has part
[1:49:56] in the first resurrection that's the
[1:49:57] rapture but the
[1:49:58] brother
[1:50:00] on such the second death has no power
[1:50:03] but there shall be priests of god and of
[1:50:05] christ and shall reign with him a
[1:50:06] thousand
[1:50:07] years that's why i want to be in the
[1:50:09] resurrection morning when the death when
[1:50:12] that
[1:50:14] surprise we shall rise hallelujah we
[1:50:17] shall rise and
[1:50:20] come on
[1:50:22] oh the words have disappeared
[1:50:26] okay that's a very wonderful song but i
[1:50:28] love it
[1:50:30] and when the thousand years expired
[1:50:32] that's after the millennium
[1:50:34] millennium by the way is a thousand
[1:50:35] years
[1:50:36] it's not two different things
[1:50:39] saturn shall be losed out of his prison
[1:50:41] like i told you and shall go out to
[1:50:43] deceive the nations which are in the
[1:50:45] four quarters
[1:50:46] of the earth gog and magog to gather
[1:50:49] them together to battle the number of
[1:50:51] womb is as the sound of the sea i
[1:50:52] already told you about that these people
[1:50:54] who are as the son of the see are the
[1:50:56] ones who were the remnant of the earth
[1:50:59] all right
[1:51:00] and the ones who had multiplied them
[1:51:02] like this under the sea meaning there
[1:51:03] were so many that they went up on the
[1:51:06] breadth of the earth and compassed this
[1:51:08] camp of the saints about and beloved and
[1:51:10] the beloved city and fire came down from
[1:51:12] god out of heaven and divided them and
[1:51:14] we got that part
[1:51:16] and the devil that deceived them was
[1:51:18] cast into the lake of fire and brimstone
[1:51:20] where the beast and the false prophet
[1:51:22] are and shall be tormented day and night
[1:51:25] forever and ever and i saw a great white
[1:51:27] throne and him that started sat on it
[1:51:29] from whom
[1:51:31] from whose face the earth and the heaven
[1:51:33] fled away
[1:51:34] and there was no place for them and i
[1:51:36] saw the dead small and great stand
[1:51:39] before god and now you see how the word
[1:51:41] film judgment is starting
[1:51:44] and the books were opened and another
[1:51:46] book was open which is the book of what
[1:51:48] you say now these people are going to be
[1:51:49] judged out of the book of life you see
[1:51:51] the bride is not among these people the
[1:51:53] bride is already done jagged when she
[1:51:56] was living on earth that's why for us as
[1:51:58] the bread of jesus christ all over the
[1:51:59] world whoever is a part of that body we
[1:52:01] are judged here on earth not then here
[1:52:04] on earth when we hear the word of god we
[1:52:06] don't have in our hearts we we accept it
[1:52:08] and we do what it says therefore that is
[1:52:10] our judgment but for them because they
[1:52:12] are then they have to judge them
[1:52:15] then it says that the dead were
[1:52:17] and which is the book of life and the
[1:52:19] dead were judged out of those things
[1:52:20] which were written in the books
[1:52:22] according to they are
[1:52:23] have you seen that yes according to
[1:52:25] their works and they say gave up the
[1:52:28] dead which were in it and the earth and
[1:52:30] the air delivered up the dead and no one
[1:52:33] would know that it would remain all of
[1:52:34] them would have to come out which were
[1:52:36] in them and they were judged every man
[1:52:38] according to their works and and death
[1:52:39] and hell were cast into the lake of fire
[1:52:42] this is the second death you see that's
[1:52:44] the second death the second death is
[1:52:46] also the destruction of of death and
[1:52:50] is of death and hair
[1:52:51] death and hair is also going to be
[1:52:53] destroyed some people think that there
[1:52:55] is going to be an eternal burning
[1:52:58] eternally no that's not true but the
[1:53:00] banham the prophet of this generation
[1:53:02] was able to tell us so and it is true
[1:53:04] it's biblically true there is nothing if
[1:53:07] you say that you have someone is going
[1:53:08] to burn in health eternity
[1:53:10] it means they will also live
[1:53:12] eternal life
[1:53:14] you see so yeah it cannot be two types
[1:53:16] of eternal life that the one of god ones
[1:53:19] of the devil no
[1:53:20] you see there is one only one source of
[1:53:22] eternal life and that is joy god's own
[1:53:24] life and the only people who are going
[1:53:26] to live eternally are the ones who are
[1:53:27] going to live
[1:53:28] in heaven with christ
[1:53:30] the ones out of christ will be banned
[1:53:32] for maybe thousands or millions of years
[1:53:34] but he will do our will with it
[1:53:37] and whatsoever wasn't found written in
[1:53:38] the book of life was cast into the lake
[1:53:40] of fire
[1:53:42] so those ones who are not whose names
[1:53:43] are not even on the book of life those
[1:53:44] ones they didn't even waste time on them
[1:53:46] they just throw them in the lake of fire
[1:53:49] where did they come from
[1:53:53] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:53:57] okay
[1:54:00] have you got the answer to your question
[1:54:04] you will see them when we are there my
[1:54:06] brother when we get there many of those
[1:54:09] questions will be answered
[1:54:11] all right yes
[1:54:20] no one day to god is a thousand years
[1:54:25] and a thousand
[1:54:26] years to the lord is one day
[1:54:30] but the timing and the timeline and
[1:54:32] accounting of god with the jews
[1:54:35] was one week
[1:54:37] was seven years
[1:54:39] right
[1:54:40] one week
[1:54:43] was
[1:54:45] seven years
[1:54:46] seventy weeks
[1:54:48] was
[1:54:51] 49
[1:54:53] 49 490 years
[1:54:57] so is that
[1:54:59] does that answer your question
[1:55:03] why did you ask that
[1:55:05] what is it that you want to know
[1:55:23] okay
[1:55:34] ah
[1:55:35] so if it's going to be a million years
[1:55:37] as it means like eternity it is forever
[1:55:40] and ever but it's not eternity
[1:55:42] there is an element of time on it
[1:55:45] the way we count is not the way god
[1:55:46] counts
[1:55:48] and also a million years is not like a
[1:55:50] scriptural verse
[1:55:52] it's an estimate it's like to say it
[1:55:54] could be for really a long time
[1:55:57] but we don't know how long
[1:55:59] but for sure the bible says the hell was
[1:56:02] created
[1:56:03] and anything created has an end
[1:56:05] only that which has no beginning has no
[1:56:08] end and that's why jesus is god
[1:56:11] because jesus had no beginning and had
[1:56:14] no end
[1:56:16] it is only that without a beginning that
[1:56:18] has no
[1:56:20] end
[1:56:25] all right keep them coming
[1:56:31] you have quenched your questions
[1:56:54] i'm sure there will be do we see our
[1:56:56] presence now do we see our king
[1:56:59] we don't see them the way we want but we
[1:57:01] shall see them
[1:57:09] uh we shall be in a form that jesus was
[1:57:12] by the time you went to heaven
[1:57:14] you can appear and you can disappear
[1:57:20] what i say
[1:57:38] no
[1:57:40] excuse me the the that would be the city
[1:57:42] first question it will be right here on
[1:57:44] ah
[1:57:45] it's the city that jacob wanted to be a
[1:57:47] part of
[1:57:49] who's builder
[1:57:51] and mecca is god not mine so that's
[1:57:54] where we shall be and that's why the
[1:57:56] support those people were not able to
[1:57:58] destroy it
[1:57:59] so like someone said
[1:58:02] that when we go into the eruption then
[1:58:05] we'll be not knowing anything that
[1:58:07] happens often now
[1:58:14] now
[1:58:16] are you telling me that the people who
[1:58:18] died now they don't know what is
[1:58:19] happening
[1:58:22] especially those who are in christ
[1:58:25] they know what is happening they see you
[1:58:26] even what is happening they see even
[1:58:29] better than we do
[1:58:30] so but
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:32] the rapture you see that where we are in
[1:58:35] the marriage supper is different from
[1:58:36] where we are in the millennium
[1:58:39] the marriage supper we're in heaven
[1:58:41] the
[1:58:42] millennium we are on earth
[1:58:44] that's completely different
[1:58:47] dimension
[1:58:52] in the rapture
[1:58:54] in the rapture we are going in heaven
[1:58:56] in the rapture we are going to be in
[1:58:58] heaven
[1:58:59] not
[1:58:59] on earth
[1:59:01] because you know that's the marriage
[1:59:02] supper of the lamb and god and jesus has
[1:59:04] promised that it will be
[1:59:06] in heaven
[1:59:08] yeah so scripture actually said that you
[1:59:11] you'll meet us over there
[1:59:13] now you wanted to read them
[1:59:20] it says one day is like unto god
[1:59:23] a thousand is it there's a thousand
[1:59:25] years
[1:59:29] have you read that before
[1:59:33] yes yes
[1:59:35] okay can you now read it
[1:59:38] second peter chapter three
[1:59:40] always avoid just someone reading for
[1:59:42] you you must always do it for yourself
[1:59:45] they will ask you and then
[1:59:46] your lips will just drop because you
[1:59:48] don't know
[1:59:53] second peter chapter three
[1:59:58] verse eight
[2:00:02] okay someone read
[2:00:05] but beloved
[2:00:08] be not ignorant of this one thing
[2:00:11] that one day is with the lord as a
[2:00:14] thousand years
[2:00:16] and a thousand years as one day
[2:00:19] and a thousand years
[2:00:22] as one did you believe that
[2:00:24] and that's exactly the truth
[2:00:27] so
[2:00:28] you you can bookmark that in your bible
[2:00:30] and uh always know where you can you
[2:00:32] want to get it if you want it
[2:00:34] and i think your questions are
[2:00:37] getting us at the end of our bible study
[2:00:39] so you have more so that we can conclude
[2:00:41] with them
[2:00:42] anyone with any question
[2:00:46] the second day
[2:00:49] the second death
[2:00:51] is
[2:00:53] the destruction of the soul
[2:00:56] whereas the first death
[2:00:58] is sleeping
[2:01:01] what we call death today brother samuel
[2:01:04] is
[2:01:05] just sleeping
[2:01:07] no one dies really
[2:01:09] because
[2:01:10] the body just dies
[2:01:12] but the soul of spirit is the light
[2:01:16] you didn't know that
[2:01:19] so
[2:01:20] can you really say that someone is dead
[2:01:21] when they are alive somewhere else
[2:01:24] so that's the first death
[2:01:27] but the second death
[2:01:28] you are not alive anywhere else
[2:01:30] you are destroyed forever
[2:01:32] eternally
[2:01:34] that's the total destruction even the
[2:01:36] devil himself will be destroyed in that
[2:01:37] crack of fire
[2:01:40] so that that lake of fire will destroy
[2:01:42] spirits
[2:01:43] and he will destroy souls
[2:01:46] it means annihilation complete complete
[2:01:49] annihilation
[2:01:51] of that soul
[2:01:53] done with
[2:01:54] total separation no return
[2:01:57] so you can't say let me burn in hell for
[2:01:59] 1000 years and then i'll come out and
[2:02:01] defend
[2:02:03] way at all
[2:02:05] so the first date is the death of the
[2:02:07] body the second death is a death and
[2:02:08] soul
[2:02:12] yes
[2:02:15] right now our people are some
[2:02:22] no
[2:02:24] they are being tormented for sure but
[2:02:26] they are not burning
[2:02:29] tormenting fermented
[2:02:33] do you know you don't understand what is
[2:02:35] settlemented
[2:02:36] they are suffering
[2:02:38] they are they are suffering they're in a
[2:02:40] place
[2:02:41] where they are not happy where there is
[2:02:43] no joy where there is no fellowship
[2:02:45] where there is nothing you are just
[2:02:46] there alone
[2:02:48] seeing us die alone
[2:02:51] i heard someone saying
[2:02:53] i don't care after all there are many
[2:02:55] people going to hell
[2:02:56] we shall go up there and throw apart
[2:03:00] they think that you wonder if someone in
[2:03:02] here they will just enjoy
[2:03:04] no it won't be
[2:03:07] one day i told you of this story
[2:03:09] sometime back i was still in school in
[2:03:11] high school
[2:03:13] and
[2:03:16] that day they say that
[2:03:17] we had a party a school party
[2:03:20] and
[2:03:22] they told everybody to come well-dressed
[2:03:24] so i thought it was food
[2:03:26] and i thought it was going to be a
[2:03:28] wonderful time so
[2:03:29] when i reached there i noticed i was
[2:03:32] hearing something
[2:03:37] you might you might say that you mean
[2:03:38] you were that a fool at that age because
[2:03:40] i was in high school
[2:03:43] i wasn't raised in an atmosphere of
[2:03:45] discourse so it wasn't really my thing
[2:03:48] i'd never gone to one
[2:03:49] but that day when i went there i noticed
[2:03:52] that actually they were having a pate of
[2:03:54] dancing
[2:03:55] maybe it was a surprise the school did i
[2:03:57] don't know
[2:03:58] so i said better let me go and see what
[2:04:00] happens in there usually they just check
[2:04:02] their bodies or i mean what does it
[2:04:05] what happens they just dance or what
[2:04:07] so when i reached there and i reached
[2:04:10] the doorway i was about to enter like
[2:04:13] that
[2:04:14] and there is this wave
[2:04:16] of heat
[2:04:18] that
[2:04:20] hit on me
[2:04:21] you know why they are all flexing their
[2:04:23] muscles and dancing of course they're
[2:04:24] generating a lot of heat
[2:04:28] it just hit on me like this and it
[2:04:31] repelled me
[2:04:33] i said i would not come back here again
[2:04:36] that was the last that was the first and
[2:04:38] the last time i came close
[2:04:41] to a discovery
[2:04:43] but i was thinking that these people are
[2:04:45] really in hell
[2:04:47] it is really hair
[2:04:50] yet on earth
[2:04:53] you can't call that place
[2:04:55] a good place
[2:04:57] you know
[2:04:58] why there is a mixture of all spirits
[2:05:01] demonic spirits
[2:05:03] and a believer you find yourself in such
[2:05:05] a scenario and you are happy
[2:05:07] there is a problem a big problem with
[2:05:09] you you see that's why i believe i can
[2:05:11] never go to such discuss surely no no
[2:05:13] way if you want to dance church is the
[2:05:16] right place for doing that okay
[2:05:19] now
[2:05:20] in here
[2:05:22] there is no throwing parties and dancing
[2:05:23] like they do on earth
[2:05:26] in air i'll give you an experience and
[2:05:29] maybe you'll imagine it a little bit
[2:05:34] did you remember or do you remember that
[2:05:36] that ship that got wrecked at lake
[2:05:38] victoria
[2:05:41] yeah that brought cruz yes
[2:05:44] it is said that even the people who
[2:05:47] would have survived were pulled down by
[2:05:49] the others
[2:05:50] who were sinking
[2:05:52] you know this is water you have to
[2:05:54] understand and water is deep
[2:05:56] there is no it's like a bottomless pit
[2:05:59] so when you feel you are going down you
[2:06:02] are not minding about anyone else you
[2:06:03] don't even remember you had a girlfriend
[2:06:05] around
[2:06:06] even if you see her there and she is up
[2:06:08] you want to pull her down
[2:06:10] for you to go up you understand
[2:06:12] so it is only
[2:06:14] offending for yourself
[2:06:16] bad minding about yourself that is the
[2:06:19] that's the
[2:06:20] how hell is
[2:06:23] bottomless pit
[2:06:24] sinking feet and there is no hair there
[2:06:27] is no
[2:06:29] there is no
[2:06:31] um there is no bottom to eat
[2:06:34] and there is a lot of heat
[2:06:36] and there is a lot of discomfort and
[2:06:38] there is a lot of being alone you just
[2:06:40] want to come out of it but you cannot
[2:06:43] because there is no hair
[2:06:45] and no and you can't come out of it and
[2:06:48] and there's voices but the banner he was
[2:06:50] god they said he had voices
[2:06:52] all those verses echoing in his ears and
[2:06:55] you know of all the gospel and the
[2:06:57] preaching you have ever had of the
[2:06:58] people groaning of that
[2:07:00] and all those things you it is like
[2:07:02] tormenting you
[2:07:05] but you're not burning literally but you
[2:07:07] know you're being tormented and you
[2:07:08] don't have time for saying hey let us be
[2:07:11] tonight together you don't have time for
[2:07:12] that
[2:07:15] you are all by yourself
[2:07:18] may god help us not to go to that place
[2:07:21] and so
[2:07:22] hell is real
[2:07:24] but hell will be burning
[2:07:26] after the judgment because they're
[2:07:28] really bad
[2:07:29] they're really bad
[2:07:31] and uh but now they're being tormented
[2:07:33] it's not a nice place
[2:07:36] and uh
[2:07:37] so we are now at that time
[2:07:41] these are just dimensions
[2:07:44] there's this dimension where we are
[2:07:46] there is a dimension of hair and there's
[2:07:48] a dimension of heaven
[2:07:50] you can just
[2:07:51] switch
[2:07:53] as soon as you come out of that body
[2:07:54] right now
[2:07:56] there is a dimension you are going to
[2:07:57] which dimension will that be it will be
[2:07:59] determined by how you lived on this
[2:08:01] earth
[2:08:02] whether you accepted this word or not
[2:08:04] everything you did or did not do would
[2:08:06] not would not mind would not will not be
[2:08:08] important at that time
[2:08:10] it would be whether you lived true to
[2:08:12] the word of god or not may god help us
[2:08:15] so we can live true to his word so you
[2:08:18] can be able to go to heaven and not hell
[2:08:22] you don't want to go to hell you sure
[2:08:23] you want to go to heaven yes
[2:08:28] any more questions
[2:08:29] before we cross
[2:08:32] yes
[2:08:36] how many times will the rapture be
[2:08:39] i do not know
[2:08:41] because
[2:08:44] there
[2:08:45] are certain things that are not made
[2:08:48] known
[2:08:49] because we don't need to know
[2:08:51] but for those
[2:08:53] times we know that the bible speaks of
[2:08:55] the rapture
[2:08:56] we know it has happened before
[2:08:58] it has happened before with elijah
[2:09:01] it has happened before with them
[2:09:05] the ones who were dead in christ who
[2:09:08] were in paradise when jesus christ who
[2:09:10] died they rose again that was a rapture
[2:09:12] they were raptured
[2:09:14] and we know it is going to happen with
[2:09:16] us
[2:09:18] and
[2:09:19] i don't know whether the second
[2:09:20] resurrection i should call the rapture
[2:09:22] but i know they will also resurrect
[2:09:25] all those who are alive they will direct
[2:09:27] and they'll be able to meet
[2:09:29] the
[2:09:30] the lord on the day of judgment
[2:09:32] so
[2:09:33] that's all i can say that those are the
[2:09:35] ruptures i see the major raptures in the
[2:09:37] bible
[2:09:38] yeah so the one where we are headed
[2:09:41] and the one we shall be after the
[2:09:43] millennium
[2:09:47] if there are others in the middle there
[2:09:49] that is
[2:09:54] yes are we done
[2:09:56] for tonight
[2:09:57] my my your questions are flowing to go
[2:09:59] like a river all right go ahead brother
[2:10:01] be deported
[2:10:06] but the
[2:10:08] pope
[2:10:09] the antichrist
[2:10:10] for him he will go to him
[2:10:12] he'll be put in here before
[2:10:14] yes
[2:10:16] yes it's only one man
[2:10:19] and the devil himself
[2:10:21] and the first him the first prophet and
[2:10:24] and
[2:10:25] the devil
[2:10:28] the first prophet and how does it put it
[2:10:31] yeah continue with your questions
[2:10:42] no
[2:10:42] but the banana says there is one who is
[2:10:45] going to be the real devil incarnate
[2:10:48] all these ones are successions of the
[2:10:51] set of the office
[2:10:52] but that office it embodies that man of
[2:10:56] sin that the bible speaks of the office
[2:10:58] of the pope the man of sin
[2:11:01] but we do not know who that man of sin
[2:11:03] is going to be but but the banham gave a
[2:11:05] prophecy and he said it will be an
[2:11:07] american pope
[2:11:10] and he says
[2:11:11] um
[2:11:13] it will when he comes on board he will
[2:11:16] be the real incarnate of what it all
[2:11:19] means
[2:11:20] so that will be one man
[2:11:23] he'll be one man
[2:11:25] the bible calls him the man of sin the
[2:11:27] bible calls him the false prophet the
[2:11:29] bible calls him many things
[2:11:31] yes what was your question
[2:11:38] for my thinking he's not the ones who
[2:11:40] have already opened
[2:11:41] the recent pops
[2:11:44] no
[2:11:45] there is a someone brother biscuit
[2:11:47] preached some years ago
[2:11:48] i really would recommend it to you
[2:11:52] he titled it the beast
[2:11:54] that
[2:11:55] was
[2:11:56] and is and is to come
[2:11:59] it's a scripture
[2:12:01] and he took that scripture and was able
[2:12:02] to
[2:12:03] tie it in with the papacy and
[2:12:06] what will happen also in the future i
[2:12:08] thought it was a good summon i listened
[2:12:10] to it some years ago i think it will be
[2:12:12] a blessing to you
[2:12:13] so after this bible study reminding me
[2:12:15] so i can give you the link
[2:12:17] for you to listen to that
[2:12:21] but that is that man who is going to be
[2:12:22] the real incarnate the devil internet
[2:12:27] and the devil that deceived them was
[2:12:30] cast into the lake of fire and brimstone
[2:12:33] where the beast and the false prophet
[2:12:35] are and shall beat them in the day and
[2:12:37] night forever so the beast and the false
[2:12:40] prophet were the one to be
[2:12:43] thrown there fast
[2:12:46] and i believe this
[2:12:51] ties in with the other scriptures
[2:12:54] and maybe in the in the i can have more
[2:12:56] study on that and then we can be able to
[2:12:58] talk about it more
[2:13:01] the beast and the first prophet
[2:13:04] i think that would be a good title
[2:13:11] yes any more questions
[2:13:25] yes
[2:13:38] that will be our headquarter which they
[2:13:39] will try to destroy
[2:13:44] yeah
[2:13:45] it will be our headquarter
[2:13:47] but it does not mean that
[2:13:49] we shall be stuck there you know
[2:13:51] we can go wherever we want to go
[2:13:53] you know
[2:13:54] so we have a status here in uganda but
[2:13:57] the president is not always in the
[2:13:59] status he goes wherever he wants to go
[2:14:02] so
[2:14:03] yeah
[2:14:05] that would be our headquarters
[2:14:09] my mind we seem so much concerned about
[2:14:11] what the things that are to be you
[2:14:13] should listen to that someone by the
[2:14:14] bottom things that have to be
[2:14:16] very very wonderful one okay
[2:14:19] are we done
[2:14:23] oh don't don't fear don't fear to answer
[2:14:25] more questions i'm not tired
[2:14:31] yes
[2:14:39] yeah that's true
[2:14:43] because
[2:14:45] jesus didn't come for them
[2:14:48] let me ask you a question
[2:14:50] when you it's a mystery of election
[2:14:53] they ever going to buy tomatoes
[2:14:57] you have ever done that
[2:14:59] did you buy the whole lot
[2:15:01] what did you do when you went to buy
[2:15:02] them
[2:15:08] so
[2:15:09] you and you chose even if it was with
[2:15:12] your money huh
[2:15:13] but you chose those that you laughed and
[2:15:15] you wanted
[2:15:16] he said put that on just add this or no
[2:15:18] put this one not so
[2:15:20] can i call you rude to have him pick
[2:15:22] that one and left the other one
[2:15:25] why
[2:15:28] it's your money and this is your will
[2:15:30] and this is your desire and it is your
[2:15:32] choice so
[2:15:33] how dare i call you rude because you you
[2:15:35] exercised your choice your power of
[2:15:37] choosing so the bible says he chose us
[2:15:40] in him before the foundation of the
[2:15:41] world
[2:15:42] so he really came to redeem those who he
[2:15:44] chose
[2:15:47] he did not come to redeem everybody
[2:15:49] he only he did not come to redeem the
[2:15:50] whole man she came to redeem those who
[2:15:52] he chose
[2:15:53] those who he died for those who he paid
[2:15:56] for because remember the lambo bleeded
[2:15:59] and died before the foundation of the
[2:16:01] world so he came to claim them
[2:16:03] all those who he had died for all those
[2:16:06] who he had been crucified for and i'm
[2:16:08] glad i'm one of those
[2:16:10] so
[2:16:11] um
[2:16:12] the others who are not when they hear
[2:16:13] the word they can't accept it they can't
[2:16:16] believe it they will not love it but you
[2:16:19] who
[2:16:20] had the word because your seed was in
[2:16:23] there
[2:16:24] it's not because you are a son of a
[2:16:25] believer or not of a believer even if
[2:16:28] you are a believers child there are many
[2:16:29] believers children who are not believers
[2:16:32] but because you you there is a seed of
[2:16:33] god in your heart when you hear
[2:16:35] ah you accept it
[2:16:38] essa and jacob were both children of the
[2:16:40] of believers right
[2:16:42] but yes i believe
[2:16:44] essa wasn't even accepted to begin with
[2:16:47] ezra lost the birthright because he was
[2:16:50] meant to lose it it was meant to be for
[2:16:52] jacob
[2:16:54] that's why when god came down he changed
[2:16:56] his name another you they were from the
[2:16:58] same womb you remember when
[2:17:00] when rebecca was still pregnant
[2:17:05] the the the voice said
[2:17:08] two
[2:17:09] children
[2:17:10] two nations
[2:17:13] are in your womb
[2:17:15] that is
[2:17:16] rebecca's womb
[2:17:17] two nations
[2:17:19] two different seeds two nations
[2:17:22] not one nation
[2:17:24] there was israel and there was another
[2:17:27] so you see how god used and loved israel
[2:17:29] because it was his chosen
[2:17:32] uh chosen one
[2:17:34] so that element of election still
[2:17:36] remains even today
[2:17:38] god
[2:17:40] is not
[2:17:41] going to
[2:17:43] save
[2:17:44] all human beings
[2:17:45] not that he cannot save all human beings
[2:17:48] i'm not saying he doesn't have the
[2:17:49] ability to but i'm saying that he won't
[2:17:53] because he only claims those who he were
[2:17:56] meant
[2:17:57] to
[2:17:58] to be saved
[2:17:59] it's a mystery
[2:18:02] but is revealed to us
[2:18:04] because we have actually had his voices
[2:18:06] my sheep
[2:18:08] hey so you mean the others one of these
[2:18:10] sheep yes
[2:18:12] hear my voice
[2:18:14] you see
[2:18:15] are you his sheep
[2:18:17] yes yeah you know some people when you
[2:18:18] preach like that they begin they get
[2:18:20] confused and they say ah
[2:18:22] so pastor are you trying to say that i'm
[2:18:24] now
[2:18:25] not his sheep
[2:18:27] are you now saying i'm a pig now
[2:18:30] me i always want to take the positive
[2:18:32] side i want to see myself as the sheep
