You are there. Say amen. Amen. Are you there? Amen. So, let's read in the name of the Lord. Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gal. And Caleb the son of Jeffy the Kennesite said unto him, "Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses, the man of God, concerning me, and thee in Kadesh Bania, 40 years old was I then when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kadeshiban to spy out the land. and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart. Verse 8, nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I followed the Lord my God. And Moses swear on that day, saying, Surely the land where thy feet have told shall be thine inheritance, and thy children forever, because thou has h wholly followed the Lord my because thou has followed the Lord my God. Verse 10. And now, behold, the Lord has kept me alive, as he said, these 40 and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness. And now, lo, I'm this day four for 5 years old. as yet I'm I'm as strong this day as I was in that day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in. Now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day. For thou hardest in that day, how the anarchims were there, that the cities were great and fenced. If so be, the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said. Verse 13, and Joseph blessed him, and gave Caleb, the son of Jeffy, Hebron, for an inheritance. Verse 14. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Calb, the son of Jeff the Kennesite, unto this day because that he followed the Lord God of Israel. I can read. Amen. Amen. Got it. forchech. Amen. Amen. Let's go to the New Testament. Ephesians chapter 1. Then let's read verse 11. You can read the whole chapter from verse one as it flows. But let's go to verse 11. Ephesians chapter 1 vers 11. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the council of his own will. Let's pray. Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you for this morning. Thank you for gathering us. Thank you for this fellowship, your servant, Pastor and all the believers in this place. Lord, we pray father that you speak to our hearts. Reveal thy word for each one of us, Lord. Lift us up. Take us a step higher. Let us be transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit. Let us be blessed by thee, Father. Let us live here in the testimony that surely we have heard from you. those who are in the live stream. May you bless them. May you meet the needs of every person for your glory, your honor in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen and amen. Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I greet you once again in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So the title of my message possessing your inheritance. Yes. Possessing your inheritance. Hallelujah. Amen. So we see here in the Old Testament had an inheritance. God promise him that you will possess your inheritance something that is for you because you have followed the Lord God of Israel. So Caleb knew that one day I will possess an inheritance. One day I will get Heblon. He went through battles. He went through hard times in the wilderness. They were fighting. They many died. But Caleb would not die. He couldn't die because he had an inherit. One day he had to get it. God kept him alive until that day. And he told Joshua that you know what happened? How the children of Israel Many died in the wilderness. How the 10 spies who are sent who are sent there were 12. They were sent when they came back. 10 spies gave a report that made the heart of the hearts of people melt. But Joshua and we are different. They they had a purpose. They were up to something. They were not to stop in the wilderness. They were to enter the promised land and possess an inheritance. Hallelujah. Amen. He told Mo He told Joshua that you had Moses very well that I have to get an inheritance. Yes, I'm old, but I'm still strong. I can still fight. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm still I still have the vigor. Yes. 45 years. I can still go for war. I can still fight. I possess that inheritance. Hallelujah. So was not giving up. He was not giving a negative report. No, no, no. He was a storm. He knew what God promised him, he was to possess it. Hallelujah. Amen. So my brother, my sister, as had an inheritance, you also have an inheritance. Hallelujah. Amen. God gave you an inheritance because it has said in Ephesians 1 11 Jesus Christ obtained an inheritance. Hallelujah. Amen. And you want to look at that inheritance. His inheritance was Hebron was a mountain. Hallelujah. But for us we have a spiritual inheritance. Hallelujah. And you have to possess it. Hallelujah. Amen. And the prophet says, God gave you this inheritance before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And our Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross make a way for you to get to your inheritance. Hallelujah. Amen. Now listen to the prophet. I like to quote the prophet. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Now listen. He says here the message adoption to God. He says here inheritance by predestination. Adoption 177. It says inheritance by predestination. I inherited something. What inheritance? There had to be somebody leave me an inheritance. Why? You say Jesus left me left you an inheritance. Beg your pardon. Jesus never left me an inheritance. Jesus never left you an inheritance. He only came down. He paid your paid for your inheritance. Yes, sir. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So Jesus came on the cross and died to make a way for you and me to get to our inheritance. Why? Because we are sons and daughters of God. Jesus came on the cross. Amen. We are there in the mind of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Before the devil was created, Satan was created. [screaming] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. And that's what God asked Job. Where was thou when the sons of God shouted for Job in the morning star together? Hallelujah. Amen. Where was thou? When I laid the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. Amen. [screaming] We were thou. Amen. Amen. So he was asking Job where he was thou remind where he was that he was not in this time. He was there in the mind of God. Amen. Even though even though he has gone through problems, he has gone through trials. He has gone through sicknesses, but he will not fail. He's victorious. He's an overcomer because we are there in the mind of God was there before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. He was passing through those trials, those hard times that he was go back where he came from. Hallelujah. Amen. And Job he gave he got the revelation. He said, even thy die. Amen. Amen. Even the wombs eat my flesh. One day I will see my redeemer. I will see my redeemer. He was speaking about the resurrection. That one day you resurrect. Hallelujah. Amen. So my friend, my brother, my sister, you have an inheritance. Your inheritance was yours. Was [screaming] yours before you are born. That's why you are born. That's why you are here. That's why you're hearing the gospel. The gospel, your being here is a way is a channel make you rich inheritance. [screaming] Hallelujah. Amen. Oh my my my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir. Oh my. Amen. So he says your inheritance was there. Jesus Christ died to make a way for you to get to your inheritance. So Jesus Christ, yes, died. Hallelujah. Amen. To bring you your inheritance. But your name was put on the lamb's book of life from the foundation of Amen. Amen. And when it was put there, God gave you your inheritance. Hallelujah. Amen. Your inheritance was fast. Your inheritance was fast. Jesus only come. Amen. Oh my. And he says, "Oh," he says, "Uhhuh, here's the way." They try to make it. God is saying, "There's a lot of people who who are lost. Not one of them will be saved. So I will send Jesus down there and perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry and know what I have done and get saved. Oh mercy I wouldn't run my office like that even as as poor as I do run it. I wouldn't do it that way. How about God? Oh, God [screaming] is not taking chances betting you know. Give this one Jesus die somewhere. No, God is not like that. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Listen. Paragraph 178. Oh my. Amen. He says paragraph 178. He says God God by his for knowledge. He is seen exactly who would be saved. He knew for hand and saw what was to come. Mhm. Seen exactly who would be saved and who would not be saved. So he sent Jesus to save those who whom he had already chosen. So God looked in this day in this age and saw you and me who will be saved and when he saw us that we will be saved then he chose us. And he sent Jesus to die for each one of us. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And when he saw all that, he started working on it. Hallelujah. Amen. So you are coming here today by accident. It is God's plan for you to be here today. this way rest. Hallelujah. And that's why nothing can stop us in our journey. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh my my. Oh my. Didn't Paul say five verses behind this? He says Paul said that he chose us in him before there was a world. That's our inheritance. God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price. Hallelujah. Amen. that what his shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh my. He says nothing you do. It is him who did it. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And that's our inheritance. Our inheritance is already paid for already ours right now. We are possessing it day by day. We are possessing it. As you come to church, you are possessing it. When you heard the gospel, when you had the gospel and you accepted Jesus Christ and you repented of your sin and you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, what were you doing possessing inheritance? Hallelujah. [screaming] Amen. Possessing inheritance is a process. taking your inheritance is a process. Hallelujah. Amen. When possess the mountain, he never took it immediately in seconds. No, no, no. Can you imagine even first go to Joshua and told you what Moses said that I I have to possess my inheritance and he told him what happened and Joshua told him surely you have to possess inheritance I give you for your inheritance and had to get swords to get spears had to go out there and fight [screaming] and drive off everybody who was on his mountain so that he can possess Hallelujah. Amen. It may have taken him days. It may have taken him weeks or months, but he had to fight every day, every day until he got his mountain. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why Christianity is not one day. No. Hallelujah. You enter, you become saved. You repent. You are baptized in water. You are you come out. You are sanctified. You claim the Holy Ghost and pray one month, two months, three months, four months until the Holy Spirit comes. The prophet prayed for six months to get the Holy Spirit. So my brother, that's what it means to get an inheritance. Hallelujah. Amen. We are still possessing. We are still possessing. Whatever you possess, that's yours because where you lay your feet will be your possession. So day by day he was laying a feet and that was his he was laying a and that was and that's how it should be for you a Christian every day you should claim something every day you should get a step high you should move forward hallelujah amen don't stay in one place so a Christian is in a journey possessing his inheritance until the climax which we shall see. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So my brother, my sister, we are here to possess. We are here to possess. We are here to get somewhere. Hallelujah. Oh, glory be to God. Oh my my my. socalibible food and until he reached where was supposed to reach. Amen. My my my hallelujah. Just like this. So we are called before the foundation of the world. Amen. So when you are born here when you were born by your mother and father. Amen. for you. You didn't know that you have an inheritance. But one day you heard the gospel and one day you responded to the call of the gospel. Why did you respond? Preachers preach and many listen. Some abuse. Some laugh at the gospel. criticize, but you when you had it, you accepted it. Sometimes some of us were a little bit hesitant. Amen. When we had never made a decision right away, but there was something which followed us, convicting us, convicting us, convicting us until we had no peace. And we said [screaming] this is the truth. I have to follow it. Oh my. Oh my my. Amen. My brother. If I can give you a testimony. How I believed in this message. And the brother preached to me the gospel. Preached me the message of the Lord. and he showed me. He gave me a magazine. The Lord God has spoken. I saw it. There was a man with a pill with a a light on his head. I said, "My Bible told I I saw it." So this is the man. He's calling him a prophet. But the Bible said in the end time there will be false prophets. I said I went on my knees. I was an angry. So I prayed. I said, "Lord, if this is true, if this man is is is your prophet, guide me." I left it at that. Then it took time but one day a voice spoke I was convicted one night and I cried tears that this is the truth. voice was telling me that's the truth follow it and he had preached to me the gospel in I had come to campala by the time I was convicted I was in campa and I was in a place and I don't know where to turn it I have been convicted I want to get to this truth fellowship beapt to God. And one day this brother, brother Alfred came not knowing where I am. He came, the Holy Spirit led him and I was in India in the suburbs there and I saw him entering the compound without knowing where I am. There were no phones at that time.

As you pray, as you come to church, as you enter into prayer, praise God, cry to God. We are the one the Holy Spirit touches you being changed for glory glory. Glory until one day you reach the maturity. Are we together? Are you seeing your inheritance? So brother had to fight and you have to fight. We were fighting with his swords, fighting with his spears for us. We fight in a spiritual way, with the word of God, with prayer, with fasting. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother, I believe in prayer and fasting. Fasting is part of Christian life as prayer is part of the Christian life. The prophet fasted and prayed. Our Lord Jesus Christ fasted. The apostles, prayed and fasted. Believers should do the same. If there are things which are not moving in your life, dedicate time and pray and fast to move certain hurdles. Amen. You remember one time. There was a demon a boy had epip and was brought to the apostles. The disciples they could not cast out and then that child was brought to Jesus and Jesus cast away the disciples asked him privately. Yes, you gave us power, but this demon wouldn't go away. And he said, "Such cannot go away unless you pray and fast. Are you hearing that? There are things which may refuse to go unless you enter into prayer and fasting. That's right. So, brother, sister, use that weapon to fight for inheritance. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So my brother, my sister, as you are growing, as you are praying, as you come to church, hallelujah, we are possessing our inheritance, the seven virtues, the seven character of Jesus Christ in the message of the perfect man is part of our inheritance. We should claim it. We should possess it day by day as prayer. Pray for that because unless we strike a perfection, the rapture cannot take place. Listen to this in the message stage of the perfect. Listen to what the prophet says. Oh, hallelujah. You love him. Give up to the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] Praise be to God. Amen. The message stage of the perfect man. The prophet says this. Amen. This is part of our inheritance. You get it. Search of the perfect man paragraph 366 says you get this. These people here who died in Christ in here are depending and waiting on us. Do you see why we are called? They are depending and waiting on who? On who? you me. Oh, and he says, "So this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection. Hallelujah. That is part of our inheritance. We must grow. We must add them seven virtues to reach perfection for what? To bring about the resurrection. Because before the rapture takes place, there must be resurrection of the sleeping saints. Those who died in Christ from the first church age, they are waiting for the believers, the bride of this age to come to perfection. That's why God had to reveal all the trees, the seven seals, the seven church ages, seven thunders, every mystery that was hidden, revealed to bring out the entire plan of redemption so that we can see our position in Christ. can inherit and raise up to possess it. Hallelujah. Can you clap to the Lord? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my. Oh my my. And he says and they under souls under the altar waiting for this church come to this perfection.

The prophet said God cannot entrust us with his power until we have character handle it. Right now we have power under control. It is in measure. But we are talking about the fullness which is coming. Adoption is perfection. Adoption will be released through power, true authority of adopted sons and daughters. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir. The prophet speaks about a a child born in a family. When a child is young cannot be given full authority, cannot sign on a check, cannot drive a car, cannot go here and do this and this. But when a child has been trained under tutors and he has been proved to have the right character, he was given full authority. If you sign on the church on behalf of his father, he can do the work of his father and we we are undergoing training right now. What's going on is bride training. We are being trained through trials, through problems, through sickness, as we come to church, as we pray, as we believe God, different things. Some things we believe take a long to happen and you cry unto God [screaming] and things don't change. Don't worry. God is at work. He's training you. He's giving you patience. If you perseverance, Hallelujah. [screaming] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody abuses you. Somebody speaks against you. Somebody does this and this forgive them.

Romans 8 speaks about manifestation of the sons of God. All creation are waiting for the manifestation of the sons and we are those sons who should be manifested in our day. It is part of our inheritance. Amen. So when you get character when we get character give us full power. power to speak the word. When we speak the word, what we what we speak will be manifested. Power of the spoken word as it was in the life of our prophet William. He went through training. He got character and God gave him power of the spoken word. spoke and what he spoke was manifest.

And when you tell your brother, your son, your daughter, your mother, your uncle, your aunt, and tell them today you are saved, you are getting saved right now. that word, the Holy Spirit will go with it and convict the soul of that relative of yours. And at that moment, your relative will repent and accept Jesus as his Lord and Savior. The same way happened to sister's sons. My brother, my sister, That's our inheritance. Salvation of our loved ones. You keep pressing on. Hallelujah. You will reach there. God called us for that. My my my So my brother, my sister, there is a land to possess. There's an inheritance to possess. Hallelujah. Amen. And the climax of it will be the resurrection because the prophet said, "Hallelujah." Amen. In the message, what was the Holy Ghost given for?

People don't even know us. You speak about brother. Brother who is that? We have a fellowship in a school. Our fellowship is in a school. We have a church. There are believers in the community. and school students and these students come from different religions and you preach to them the messenger. We speak about the messenger we speak about brother and they wonder who is that. One young man told us, "But this gospel you preach, people don't know it. There are many saved people, but you, we don't hear of you. They don't know us. But don't worry, we cannot be known everywhere." But let me tell you, at the back of the desert, God is at work. Hallelujah. He's shaping us a great working masterpiece. Amen. When a great masterpiece is being worked upon cannot be displayed. Amen. It is always hidden somewhere. And every day the master's character, he comes with his hammer and he hits and knocks. He comes with his chisel and he cuts this cuts that this and people don't see that.

And the fullness, the fullness of the Holy Spirit will be in us. The fullness of the power of the Holy Spirit will be in us. And there everybody will see that there are people who believe the message of the hour. There are people who believe the message of the hour. There are people who believe a prophet called William and those people have power. Those people have authority. Those people what they are speaking is coming to pass. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, my brother, my sister, your neighbors, your neighbors, they're going to know what you believe. Your friends who are criticizing you. We know that what you believe has power. Even now the power is there but it has it is under control. The control faith. That person you want to pray for. You have to preach to him first. The gospel of healing. He has to believe divinely healing and then he's healed. Are you are you seeing that? The the person you want saved, you have to preach to him the gospel of salvation and he believes it and accepts Jesus. But now when you're perfected another law which will come which overrides their decision which overrides whether they like it or not has decreed. It has to be so. Hallelujah. [screaming] Amen. My my my oh I feel like more things are coming. But now listen to this brotherham with the power of the spoken word. He didn't want the authority of the other party. He didn't want he didn't have to the other party be convinced. No with the power of the spoken one. God was in control. It overrides the other person. It overrides everything. Look what those sons of Sister Hart. They didn't. He just commanded and they repented the dead fish. He just spoke and it got life. Uhhuh. Sister M is tumor. He never went there and preached you that can disappear. No, he just said before the doctors touch my let that tumor disappear. And the tumor had it obeyed. Sister just found the tumor disappear. Sister confession. Hallelujah. It had to override. Hallelujah. A situation. My brother, my sister, let's press on into that situation. Let's press on [screaming] into that fear. Oh my brother, my sister, we're going to see the manifestation of we are going to be manifested as sons and daughters of God authority and people will know William Brham was a prophet of so my sister that power will shake and check even the denominations will try to touch us and not get us because we shall have authority. That's when they will know that these people have been there. These people were we are hidden and now they on display. Hallelujah. And that power at its climax will resurrect the sleepies. And that will be the voice of the king which is the voice of the resurrection. And then in the rapture we hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's our inheritance. That's what you should fight for. That's why you should claim to possess every day in your prayer. Get a step higher. Get a step higher. The saints are waiting on me. Hallelujah. He say the message what was the Holy Ghost given.

That you died on the cross so that you might make it possible for us to attain all that was once ours. You did not just leave us an inheritance. We already had it. It was ours before the foundation of the world, but you came and paid for it that we might get it back. We were redeemed. We thank you, Father, for the ministry. Bless Pastor Jesse. bless his wife, for all his children and family, his ministry. Lord, as he has been a blessing to the body in this area, may you also be a blessing to him. Give him strength, Lord, in his body, Lord, in his spirit. Father, as a pastor and as a leader, he goes no doubt through, Lord. and together with his family and they need your grace. Lord, he has come and labored and strengthened us and encouraged us. May you also in turn bless him and encourage him. Strengthen him that whenever he stands, he will [music] continue to be a blessing to the poor. Father, we also ask your blessings upon the people that have given something, Lord, just a [music] love offering to our brother. I pray that you bless them and bless every one of us as we go. We are committing yourself into your [music] into your hands until we meet again the precious name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. [applause] So [music] before you go, uh I Pastor Pastor Chakon surprised me when he bumped into my house the other day. Unexpected. [music] So uh we had received these letters. You can have you can be seated. We had received these letters from the Mana meetings. So I didn't get had not gotten a chance to get the details. But in talking to him the other day he clarified that uh the meeting they will have a whole day meeting the first day will be from morning. I presume they are because I don't remember clearly but I think they'll be having two services every day in the morning and afternoon from 17th that is next Friday actually Friday [music] this week. So Friday this week they'll be having two services and uh Saturday they will be having two services as well. So and sand as well. So I think that anyone in this church who would like to participate in those meetings to go and be in fellowship with the believers there you're more than welcome to do that. So I think [music] we have two full days to participate in that is Friday and Saturday. [music] If you want to go and be there and be in all the services will be wonderful. So that means if you want to go Friday morning and afternoon, Saturday morning and afternoon, that's okay. But you are very busy at work and you just want to find a day and [music] then you go or a service find. So our Sunday service will not be interrupted here Sunday and then our Wednesday of course. So we shall be here again on Wednesday uh this week. [music] So the Lord bless you. And before I had just forgotten, I did not note it down here. On Wednesday, we also have a a visiting minister, a brother from Sweden. Uh I don't know him, but uh another minister in another country linked him up with us. That brother is coming here, I think, for some work. [music] But I learned he was a minister and I asked him and I invited him to come and minister to us that Wednesday. Praise the Lord. So don't miss Wednesday service. Be here on Wednesday [music] and be blessed again. So this is a season of blessings. The ones who missed Friday, I don't know whether you will ever have something like that again. It's always increasing, I know, but Friday was something else. So, don't miss services. Try and come as much as you can. So, the Lord bless you and go with you. [music] We'll meet on on on Wednesday. Leaning when I'm safe and [music] sister we need [singing] [singing] [music] [music] in the last. [music] Oh, how bright your [singing] strong everlasting [singing and music] friends. [music] You everlasting. [music and singing] What a [music and singing] dream. I might be my last [music] blessed peace with my Lord on the everlasting God [music] leading [music] Le safe and secure from all islands. [music] [music and singing]
