[1:46:14] three up to verse
[1:46:17] four
[1:46:19] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[1:46:22] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:46:24] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:46:26] and exalt you that you should honestly
[1:46:28] contend for the faith which was once
[1:46:31] delivered unto the
[1:46:48] Saints for there are certain men crept
[1:46:51] in Una aware
[1:46:53] who were before of old ordained to this
[1:46:58] condemnation and ungodly men turning the
[1:47:01] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[1:47:04] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[1:47:07] Jesus Christ
[1:47:29] Amen Let us speak to the Lord once
[1:47:33] again father Lord I'm
[1:47:38] overwhelmed I'm overwhelmed knowing that
[1:47:40] I do not have the ability to speak to
[1:47:42] your people in my
[1:47:46] own I therefore need your
[1:47:48] help may you give me
[1:47:51] utterance may you give my brother Grace
[1:47:53] to
[1:47:55] interpret and may you all give all of us
[1:47:57] Grace to
[1:47:58] hear give us a good
[1:48:00] atmosphere where we can sit down in the
[1:48:03] quietness of the
[1:48:04] spirit and hear what the spirit has to
[1:48:06] say to the
[1:48:07] church Lord bless each of us everyone
[1:48:10] under the sound of my voice even some
[1:48:12] who are not here physically but
[1:48:14] connecting with us by the way of live
[1:48:16] streaming father may you bless
[1:48:19] them and may may by the end of the day
[1:48:22] May we say that Lord has visited
[1:48:24] Us in Jesus
[1:48:27] name
[1:48:28] amen please be
[1:48:31] seated so um usually when uh I'm
[1:48:36] preaching I desire that um not only when
[1:48:40] I'm preaching but when every preacher is
[1:48:41] preaching really I desire that every oh
[1:48:43] I'm happy to see brother
[1:48:46] Andrew instead of leaning over you could
[1:48:48] even have a a seat CLA this side amen or
[1:48:51] there's one there which is you know you
[1:48:53] can see clearly if if you are in a place
[1:48:56] where you're not comfortable you can
[1:48:58] always ask the Deacon to Lo put you to
[1:49:00] another place of
[1:49:04] the you you should be as comfortable as
[1:49:07] possible so that you can hear the word
[1:49:09] very well and that's what I was going to
[1:49:11] say that I always desire that we don't
[1:49:14] make
[1:49:16] movements because really a typical
[1:49:18] Ministry or ministering would take uh
[1:49:21] here usually at the Church 1 hour to 1
[1:49:23] hour and a
[1:49:26] half and I believe that every every
[1:49:29] adult can really sit during the whole
[1:49:33] time unless you are unexpectant
[1:49:37] mother we used to be told when we first
[1:49:40] believe that when you come to
[1:49:44] church and um you know you begin with
[1:49:47] prayer you consecrate yourself you don't
[1:49:50] just move around outside
[1:49:53] and then you stay in the church the
[1:49:54] whole
[1:49:55] time if you feel your pressed and you
[1:49:58] need to go to the place of
[1:50:00] convenience you try to do that shortly
[1:50:02] before the preacher
[1:50:05] begins so that you don't miss any
[1:50:07] word so that you stay within under the
[1:50:11] um preaching of the word
[1:50:14] throughout and after the word you don't
[1:50:17] quickly go

[1:51:34] operating the media
[1:51:37] Department please don't be over
[1:51:40] concentrating on that and then you miss
[1:51:44] out May God minister to all of
[1:51:47] us so it is 8 minutes to 12
[1:51:53] so by 1 130 I'll be
[1:51:56] done I'm giving you that timeline so
[1:51:58] that you can
[1:52:01] focus
[1:52:03] amen everybody
[1:52:05] fine so I'm going to speak on contending
[1:52:08] for the
[1:52:11] faith and um here
[1:52:14] Jude the brother of
[1:52:17] James would write these
[1:52:20] words and he says
[1:52:23] uh to the
[1:52:25] Believers that when I gave all diligence
[1:52:27] to write unto you of the common
[1:52:32] salvation it was needful for me to write
[1:52:34] unto
[1:52:35] you and to exort you that you should
[1:52:40] honestly contend for the
[1:52:44] faith now not any
[1:52:47] faith he's not even talking about faith
[1:52:50] here
[1:52:52] is talking about the
[1:52:56] faith so now the faith is
[1:52:59] one which all the others before us
[1:53:03] had but
[1:53:05] Faith every each individual can have
[1:53:07] faith or can have a level of Faith small
[1:53:12] big but when it talks about the
[1:53:15] faith talking about the
[1:53:18] foundation he's talking about what we
[1:53:20] stand for what we believe
[1:53:23] he talking about our
[1:53:25] faith as Believers as
[1:53:28] Christians there is only one true faith
[1:53:31] in the
[1:53:32] world and then the others are all
[1:53:35] false and that true faith is what was
[1:53:38] brought in the world by Jesus
[1:53:41] Christ and was spread to the whole world
[1:53:44] by the
[1:53:46] disciples by the apostles now that is
[1:53:49] called the faith
[1:53:52] the people that have that the
[1:53:55] faith they are the ones called The
[1:53:58] Church there are many churches all over
[1:54:00] the
[1:54:01] world there are many faiths around the
[1:54:05] world many denominations around the
[1:54:07] world but there is one true faith and
[1:54:11] one true
[1:54:12] church the one true church is planted on
[1:54:15] the one true
[1:54:19] faith and today I'm speaking about
[1:54:21] containing for the
[1:54:24] faith the faith which was delivered to
[1:54:26] the
[1:54:27] disciples and which the apostles prayed
[1:54:30] all over the
[1:54:33] world and we will read it also in the
[1:54:36] Amplified
[1:54:39] version where it expounds the words and
[1:54:42] makes it more clear for
[1:54:46] us it it says excuse me please
[1:54:52] he says beloved while I was making every
[1:54:55] effort to write you about our common
[1:55:02] salvation I was compelled to write to
[1:55:05] you
[1:55:09] urgently appealing that you
[1:55:12] fight
[1:55:15] strous for the defense of the
[1:55:19] faith we hallelujah how many believer we
[1:55:22] have
[1:55:23] today you should fight
[1:55:27] stly why do we have to fight it means we
[1:55:31] are going to have
[1:55:34] opposition is to
[1:55:37] OPP praise the name of the Lord so we
[1:55:41] have to fight
[1:55:45] strenuously for the
[1:55:47] defense of the faith which was once for
[1:55:51] all handed down to the
[1:55:55] Saints the faith that is the sum of
[1:55:59] listen the the faith that is the sum of
[1:56:02] Christian
[1:56:07] belief uhuh yes yes yes yes you brought
[1:56:10] it very well the faith that is the sum
[1:56:12] of of Christian
[1:56:15] belief that was given verbally to the
[1:56:20] Believers are you hearing
[1:56:23] so these things that I'm talking about
[1:56:25] were given verb to the
[1:56:28] Believers by the
[1:56:30] apostles first by Jesus to the apostles
[1:56:34] and then the apostles they spread it all
[1:56:37] over the world many of them wrote
[1:56:40] books writing to other
[1:56:43] believers about these things I'm talking
[1:56:46] about today those things they
[1:56:49] wrote we have it in the form of the
[1:56:51] Bible
[1:56:52] but the Bible is a collection of
[1:56:57] beliefs is a collection of of of
[1:57:02] teachings of what the Believers the
[1:57:05] first original Believers stood
[1:57:11] for what the first Believers stood
[1:57:15] on what they
[1:57:17] believed what they
[1:57:19] practiced what they taught what they
[1:57:22] spread all over the world all those
[1:57:25] things are right
[1:57:26] here and and and this man here Jude is
[1:57:30] telling us I exal you that you should
[1:57:36] honestly
[1:57:38] urgently I'm appealing
[1:57:40] you I'm appealing that you fight
[1:57:44] strous for the defense of the
[1:57:48] faith which was for all handed down to
[1:57:51] the Saints
[1:57:54] for for certain now why does he say that
[1:57:57] here's the reason why for certain
[1:58:00] people have crept in
[1:58:06] unnoticed just as if they were sneaking
[1:58:10] by a side
[1:58:14] door you know when when you have a house
[1:58:17] and someone walks into your house
[1:58:20] unnoticed and then you know you you get
[1:58:23] scared when you see him in the house how
[1:58:25] did you enter now the Bible is saying
[1:58:29] there are many
[1:58:30] men who sneaked
[1:58:33] in and they came in our
[1:58:36] church brother they came in our
[1:58:40] faith the Christian
[1:58:42] faith they sneaked
[1:58:45] in
[1:58:48] unawares they are ungodly persons
[1:58:53] whose condemnation was predicted long
[1:58:57] ago for they distort the grace of
[1:59:02] God into the and immoral
[1:59:08] Freedom viewing it as an opportunity to
[1:59:11] do whatever they
[1:59:15] want they don't only stop there but they
[1:59:19] also
[1:59:20] deny and they
[1:59:23] own our only master and Lord Jesus
[1:59:28] Christ now I want you to listen to me
[1:59:30] carefully today today I this this is the
[1:59:33] kind of sermon that goes down to what we
[1:59:39] believe so only say Amen when you
[1:59:41] believe what I'm
[1:59:43] saying the Lord anointed his
[1:59:46] disciples and lay the foundation of our
[1:59:50] faith the laid the
[1:59:54] foundation the Lord anointed
[1:59:56] them and they laid Foundation the devil
[2:00:00] though did not want to stay that
[2:00:03] way so he also anointed some
[2:00:08] men to s a wrong
[2:00:10] s of his the devil's false
[2:00:15] teachings now the true
[2:00:17] church is to honestly contend for the
[2:00:20] original faith
[2:00:24] because there was a wrong seed that was
[2:00:28] SW after the right seed was
[2:00:31] swn there was also a wrong seed that was
[2:00:36] swn today we have
[2:00:39] twins twins in the Christian
[2:00:42] church and actually our Prophet says
[2:00:44] there will be twins in every
[2:00:47] Revival there has been twins in every
[2:00:50] Revival
[2:00:52] and even in in the Church of Jesus
[2:00:54] today we have twins we have a can and we
[2:00:59] have an Abel are you following me we
[2:01:03] notice that one will will contend for
[2:01:06] the original
[2:01:08] faith and another one will not will have
[2:01:13] another idea will have
[2:01:16] explanation we have reasoning we have
[2:01:19] other things but the true original
[2:01:23] Believers the True
[2:01:25] Vine they will contend for the original
[2:01:30] Faith now we have the false
[2:01:33] Vine and we have the True
[2:01:35] Vine we have the false
[2:01:38] church and we have the true church but
[2:01:41] you see it is very difficult to Now
[2:01:45] understand which is
[2:01:47] which and the Bible says it will be
[2:01:50] continually difficult
[2:01:53] until the time of the
[2:01:56] Harvest do you know we are now at the
[2:01:59] time of the
[2:02:00] harest we have
[2:02:02] arrived we at the time of the
[2:02:05] Harvest where the wheat will be taken
[2:02:08] into the
[2:02:09] Ghana and the wrong seed will be taken
[2:02:12] for
[2:02:13] burning oh I will get to that
[2:02:16] later amen the seeds will go
[2:02:19] together side by side
[2:02:22] it will be very
[2:02:24] difficult the Bible talks about the
[2:02:26] other
[2:02:27] Spirits the spirit of the
[2:02:29] Antichrist the spirit which is against
[2:02:31] the
[2:02:32] word which is against Christ he says
[2:02:36] will be it it will be
[2:02:39] very to the to the extent it will
[2:02:43] deceive the very
[2:02:45] elect it doesn't stop there many I have
[2:02:49] heard a preacher saying
[2:02:52] some elect will be
[2:02:54] deceived we thank God for the prophet of
[2:02:56] Our
[2:02:57] Generation because he has told us the
[2:03:00] elect cannot be
[2:03:03] deceived Hallelujah did you hear that
[2:03:06] the elect cannot be
[2:03:08] deceived your neighbor the can
[2:03:13] be let that sink in tell another nebor
[2:03:16] on the other side the the El cannot be
[2:03:20] deceived why
[2:03:22] because the elect is
[2:03:25] predestinated unto life the seed of God
[2:03:30] remains he cannot be
[2:03:32] deceived so the Bible says to the extent
[2:03:37] it will deceive the very
[2:03:41] El if it were
[2:03:44] possible if it were possible the very
[2:03:47] fact that there is an if
[2:03:50] there it means is not
[2:03:53] possible it is not
[2:03:56] possible amen hallelujah hallelujah amen
[2:04:00] no matter what false doctrines
[2:04:02] come I am the elect of God I cannot be
[2:04:07] deceived that's why let me tell you let
[2:04:11] me tell you brother
[2:04:12] Sam I can actually bring a Catholic
[2:04:14] priest
[2:04:16] here and give him a
[2:04:18] microphone you remember we had an
[2:04:20] anglian priest here didn't
[2:04:23] I give him a
[2:04:24] microphone whatever he says whatever he
[2:04:27] preaches whatever he sings can it
[2:04:30] deceive you can it deceive you we are
[2:04:34] not
[2:04:35] afraid we are not afraid of false
[2:04:38] teaching there are some people who close
[2:04:40] their
[2:04:41] ears because they are afraid to be
[2:04:44] deceived but let me tell you you cannot
[2:04:47] fear a
[2:04:48] sickness if you are vaccinated
[2:04:54] now we the Believers of this enti
[2:04:56] message we have received the
[2:05:00] vaccination amen this message is a
[2:05:04] vaccination we have the
[2:05:06] antidot we cannot be
[2:05:09] deceived amen we are we are on the
[2:05:13] foundation that is solid we are on the
[2:05:16] foundation that is established we are on
[2:05:19] the foundation amen Jesus Christ the
[2:05:23] word we can never be deceived we know
[2:05:27] who we
[2:05:28] are amen and so now we notice those two
[2:05:33] seeds are in the church in the framework
[2:05:37] of
[2:05:38] Christianity and the the the other
[2:05:41] spirit is very
[2:05:43] cunning it looks so much like the
[2:05:47] truth but it is not the
[2:05:49] truth Matthew 13
[2:05:53] let us go to the parable of the
[2:05:56] S we used to read these Parables or they
[2:05:59] used to read them for us in the Anglican
[2:06:02] church but really they do not have the
[2:06:06] Revelation but now under the revelation
[2:06:10] of the
[2:06:11] message we can understand the depth of
[2:06:13] the
[2:06:16] mystery vers
[2:06:20] 24 praise God and another Parable put
[2:06:24] him forth unto them saying the Kingdom
[2:06:26] of Heaven is likened unto a man which
[2:06:28] slded good seed in his field but while
[2:06:31] man slept his enemy came and sowed tears
[2:06:35] among the wheat and and went his way and
[2:06:39] went his way but when the blade was
[2:06:41] sprung up and brought forth fruit then
[2:06:44] appeared the tears also so the Servants
[2:06:46] of the householder came and said unto
[2:06:48] him sir did not thou s good seed in the
[2:06:51] field from whence then has it tears he
[2:06:55] said unto them an enemy has done this
[2:06:57] the servant said unto him Willl thou
[2:06:59] then that we go and gather them up but
[2:07:02] he said nay lest while ye gather up the
[2:07:04] tears he root up also the wheat with
[2:07:06] them let both grow together until the
[2:07:09] Harvest and in the time of harvest I
[2:07:12] will say to the Reapers Gather ye
[2:07:14] together fast the tears and bind them up
[2:07:16] in and bur and and bandles in and to
[2:07:18] burn them but gather the wheat into my
[2:07:21] Bur for
[2:08:03] yes
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:31] amen praise the name of the Lord I think
[2:08:34] that is better brother Dixon so now we
[2:08:36] see here uh he speaks this Parable has a
[2:08:40] lot has a lot in
[2:08:42] it he says the Kingdom of Heaven is
[2:08:45] likened UN to a man which sold good seed
[2:08:47] in his
[2:08:50] field Who is the man that sold good seed
[2:08:52] in
[2:08:54] hisory that is the master of the
[2:08:56] Harvest that is Jesus Christ he came
[2:09:00] down from heaven and he sold good
[2:09:02] seed can we say Amen to that and what is
[2:09:06] the field the field is our
[2:09:10] hearts amen he saw the word the word of
[2:09:15] life because the Tree of Life
[2:09:18] himself amen but while men s
[2:09:22] who are these men who are these
[2:09:26] workers these are the laborers in the
[2:09:28] field of this great Master of the
[2:09:32] Harvest when this man came down from
[2:09:35] heaven the owner of the field he picked
[2:09:39] 12
[2:09:40] men that he gave the the the
[2:09:44] instruction to go in in the whole
[2:09:47] world and plant seed to go in the whole
[2:09:51] world and preach the gospel to Every
[2:09:54] Creature what is the seed which was sold
[2:09:58] the seed which was sold was the
[2:10:00] word was the seed the word is the seed
[2:10:03] of
[2:10:04] life the spoken word is the Original
[2:10:07] Seed so we see that when these men the
[2:10:11] 12
[2:10:13] disciples rather they became 11
[2:10:16] eventually when these 11 men you know
[2:10:19] they planted seeds
[2:10:21] rather he had planted seed the
[2:10:24] master and the 11 men the
[2:10:27] workers who were with him the
[2:10:31] original
[2:10:33] Believers when they slept everybody tell
[2:10:36] someone when they
[2:10:38] slept when they slept what sleeping is
[2:10:42] this he's talking about dying in the
[2:10:45] flesh when Paul died Peter Sil
[2:10:51] all these brothers James and John and
[2:10:54] Matthew when they died when they slept
[2:10:58] the enemy
[2:11:00] came and he also saw
[2:11:04] tears among the
[2:11:06] we the wheat was already
[2:11:09] planted the seed was already
[2:11:12] planted but when the man the disciples
[2:11:16] died the the wrong seed also was planted
[2:11:21] to the church
[2:11:23] ages the church ages amen started with
[2:11:27] the age of
[2:11:29] Ephesus Ephesus was a
[2:11:33] generation that was we know it to be uh
[2:11:37] you know an age where the word was still
[2:11:42] pure and God still had many disciples
[2:11:45] alive at that
[2:11:47] time Paul was actually the messenger
[2:11:51] to the to the Ephesians Church
[2:11:54] Ag and um and you know they preach the
[2:11:57] word with all
[2:11:59] Purity they laid the foundations of the
[2:12:02] faith they were
[2:12:05] Fierce they were ready to to to be
[2:12:08] killed for what they
[2:12:10] believe they said what we are preaching
[2:12:14] we did not learn it from man is
[2:12:16] wisdom but we heard it from the
[2:12:19] spirit one of them said what we are
[2:12:21] telling you is what we saw what we
[2:12:26] heard the Savior was with us we at with
[2:12:30] him we walked with him and these things
[2:12:33] are written here they said it so it is
[2:12:37] not something that is coming from the
[2:12:39] Moon there are men who were here on
[2:12:43] Earth and God used them to lay the
[2:12:46] foundation and the truth was planted the
[2:12:49] true seed of the word
[2:12:52] pled and and but but but we see that you
[2:12:55] know 300 years
[2:12:58] later after the death of the last
[2:13:01] Apostle they established their wrong
[2:13:06] Doctrine sin
[2:13:08] cancer but remember before it was a
[2:13:11] Doctrine it was a
[2:13:14] deed it was some men who had come up at
[2:13:16] that
[2:13:18] time who were resisting the truth
[2:13:22] and they wanted men to look at them more
[2:13:24] than to look at the
[2:13:28] word if you read
[2:13:31] carefully the Bible says in the Book of
[2:13:33] Revelation
[2:13:35] 26 that at that time they had the Deeds
[2:13:37] of the
[2:13:40] nians and and and and and you know God
[2:13:43] said I hate
[2:13:45] it Ephesus was the first church
[2:13:48] age it was the beginning of the
[2:13:53] dispensation and God said they had these
[2:13:56] Deeds among
[2:13:59] them remember it had not become a
[2:14:01] Doctrine
[2:14:02] yet there were just these men were
[2:14:04] beginning to come
[2:14:06] in sneaking into the
[2:14:09] church bringing their false ideas
[2:14:12] bringing their doctrines
[2:14:15] ands but it had not yet been
[2:14:19] organized but you see
[2:14:21] as the ages
[2:14:23] progressed as time went on you know we
[2:14:27] realize later
[2:14:29] on you know that in the age of
[2:14:33] pegamos you see he says Thou Hast also
[2:14:37] them that hold the doctrine of the
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:43] niol now the
[2:14:45] did had become a
[2:14:49] doctr are you following
[2:14:52] me the the rumors had not been
[2:14:58] established what the devil had planted
[2:15:01] in
[2:15:03] Ephesus it had now been established by
[2:15:06] the age of
[2:15:09] p and it had been EST it was established
[2:15:15] established this is where the Throne of
[2:15:17] the devil
[2:15:19] was this is when they when they
[2:15:21] enthroned a
[2:15:24] man and they said this man represents
[2:15:29] God when was there ever a
[2:15:33] time in this Bible here when there was
[2:15:37] one man representing God on
[2:15:40] Earth please answer me
[2:15:43] church do you read it in your
[2:15:46] Bible it is nowhere to be
[2:15:49] found 3 years 325 years
[2:15:54] later that's when the did became a
[2:15:58] Doctrine and these men the Romans they
[2:16:02] invited all the
[2:16:05] Bishops and they brought them to this
[2:16:07] place
[2:16:11] called and they decided to have a
[2:16:14] meeting they walk
[2:16:15] coun and the council had a
[2:16:19] purpose the purpose was to unify the
[2:16:23] church because of course at that time we
[2:16:27] did not have the book called The
[2:16:29] Bible at that time we had different
[2:16:33] books written by different
[2:16:36] disciples that many different Believers
[2:16:39] had you find some Believers in
[2:16:42] Corinth they had the book of
[2:16:44] Corinth others in ephes they had their
[2:16:49] you find you go to another place you
[2:16:51] find the book of Timothy and others had
[2:16:54] the book of Fon other now these books
[2:16:56] were all
[2:16:58] different but when these men came up
[2:17:01] they said let us t let us have one world
[2:17:06] religion and let us choose among
[2:17:10] ourselves a man that will be the one
[2:17:12] representing God on
[2:17:15] Earth and we shall now name him our
[2:17:19] Pope and have power like God is power on
[2:17:24] Earth and that's when they began
[2:17:26] changing
[2:17:28] now doctrines because we shall find out
[2:17:31] later on here as I will read for you
[2:17:33] shortly that the
[2:17:35] doctrines of the
[2:17:37] Nicol were established at that
[2:17:41] time men having control over the
[2:17:46] church they no longer had the Holy Ghost
[2:17:49] controlling the church
[2:17:52] but now it became
[2:17:54] men they changed their
[2:17:58] doctrines from what the apostles
[2:18:00] originally
[2:18:04] Tau to what they now
[2:18:07] believe are you following me are you
[2:18:10] following me all right now I know I'm
[2:18:12] giving a lot of information
[2:18:14] here but sometimes we need a little bit
[2:18:16] of church
[2:18:18] history to be able to understand what we
[2:18:20] believe
[2:18:22] so now we see
[2:18:23] here that when Apostle Paul
[2:18:27] came Paul knew what he
[2:18:29] believe what Paul preached is the same
[2:18:33] thing that Peter
[2:18:34] preached it was not separate it was not
[2:18:39] different and after Paul preached what
[2:18:41] he
[2:18:42] preached he came up here and he said
[2:18:47] something or maybe I can read for you
[2:18:49] this later on
[2:18:53] let me first read this quote for
[2:18:55] you praise the name of the Lord in The
[2:18:58] Message Church the Ephesian Church
[2:19:01] H please follow me I'm going to do a
[2:19:03] little bit of
[2:19:04] reading scriptures and a
[2:19:07] few so just listen and and try to
[2:19:12] process
[2:19:14] everything a little
[2:19:16] fast okay so the true vineed
[2:19:20] the foral Deeds of the
[2:19:26] nians so did
[2:19:28] God what was this deeds in the Ephesian
[2:19:32] [Music]
[2:19:33] Church in the Church of the
[2:19:36] Ephesians they became or rather the
[2:19:38] Church of the pegamos it became a
[2:19:41] Doctrine in ephesius the first church it
[2:19:46] was a
[2:19:47] deed in the next Church it a
[2:19:51] doctr can you hear it can you understand
[2:19:55] it now it was a deed in the Ephesus
[2:19:59] Church watch over here in pamos it
[2:20:01] becomes
[2:20:03] a to those of you who don't know what
[2:20:05] I'm
[2:20:06] reading these things are in Revelation
[2:20:08] Chapter
[2:20:10] 2 you you can find it there so it just
[2:20:13] started here a little baby in a little
[2:20:16] baby
[2:20:18] form now in a minute we are going to
[2:20:20] find out what that
[2:20:23] was now here is Paul's
[2:20:28] wolves here is Paul's wall Paul's
[2:20:34] wolves the Wolves he was warning people
[2:20:39] about beware of
[2:20:41] wolves they come in ships
[2:20:46] clothing but they wolves
[2:20:50] you see they come to tear to tear the
[2:20:54] flock he says what was those wolves it
[2:20:57] was the Deeds of the
[2:21:00] nans now let's break that word
[2:21:05] down okay niol come from the
[2:21:09] word which means to
[2:21:13] conquer or to
[2:21:15] overthrow niol overthrow or to conquer
[2:21:18] the lady
[2:21:30] Ru
[2:21:32] you when
[2:21:35] isolute what he says is the Absol you
[2:21:40] cannot that is the spirit of
[2:21:44] n the spirit which
[2:21:47] rules he makes you go away from the
[2:21:49] leadership
[2:21:51] the leadership of
[2:21:53] the put you under the leadership of man
[2:21:56] are you hearing me now we realize that
[2:21:59] this was a deed in the
[2:22:03] beginning the people had the
[2:22:06] word but you see there was those people
[2:22:08] who also wanted to win them over to
[2:22:14] themselves now N means to overthrow or
[2:22:17] con
[2:22:22] all the people the congregation the
[2:22:25] Believers what they were trying to do
[2:22:27] here was trying to take the church where
[2:22:30] God had
[2:22:35] pastors no God had
[2:22:38] pastors God also had the spirit of God
[2:22:41] moving by gifts in the Church of the
[2:22:43] Living
[2:22:48] God and they were having a
[2:22:52] started that they were going to have
[2:22:54] some
[2:22:56] priests some Bishops and some pops and
[2:23:00] so forth so you see now God's
[2:23:04] plan sister listen has always been to
[2:23:07] have a
[2:23:09] church a church a triumphant Church an
[2:23:14] overcoming Church a church that is going
[2:23:17] in the
[2:23:17] rupture but do you know how God leads
[2:23:20] that church
[2:23:22] God leads that church with a fivefold
[2:23:27] Ministry and the word because the
[2:23:30] fivefold
[2:23:31] ministri are not laed by
[2:23:36] themselves listen
[2:23:38] closely the pastors the teachers the
[2:23:42] apostles the prophets the Evangelist
[2:23:45] they don't come to tell you their own
[2:23:48] mind when I'm here I am not telling you
[2:23:51] my
[2:23:52] mind if I'm telling you my mind then we
[2:23:55] are another
[2:23:57] religion but what is the work of the
[2:23:59] fivefold
[2:24:01] ministry is to lead the Church of
[2:24:04] God but how would they lead the
[2:24:07] church they Le it by two
[2:24:09] things everybody said two
[2:24:13] things they will lead the church by the
[2:24:17] word by the word don't be like those
[2:24:20] ones who wait when someone says you're
[2:24:23] going to get a Visa then they begin
[2:24:27] shouting when they hear Miracle is on
[2:24:30] the
[2:24:30] way even those ones who were doing the
[2:24:33] jum they get spared
[2:24:36] off by what men tell
[2:24:38] them but for us our men our preachers
[2:24:43] our pastors they give us the
[2:24:46] word and it is the word that excites us
[2:24:51] let me tell
[2:24:53] you if the word doesn't
[2:24:56] excite you have something wrong if you
[2:24:59] feel when you are hearing the
[2:25:02] word you get
[2:25:04] bored there is a problem with
[2:25:06] you you need to receive the Holy
[2:25:10] Spirit if you feel bored by the
[2:25:13] word I said there is a problem with
[2:25:18] you but the true genuine
[2:25:22] believer will never be bored by the
[2:25:25] word hallelujah hallu as a matter of
[2:25:28] fact when the word of God is being
[2:25:32] preached you can't sit so flat in your
[2:25:36] chair you know the word is being
[2:25:39] preached and you are
[2:25:41] dozing until you fall down there's a
[2:25:44] problem with your
[2:25:46] experience when the word is being
[2:25:48] preached you need to you to be like the
[2:25:50] man I
[2:25:51] saw when he was watching football he
[2:25:55] couldn't see still how many saw that man
[2:25:58] social media yeah I can see some of you
[2:26:01] saw him it is true as he was watching he
[2:26:05] couldn't sit still he was
[2:26:11] like that's how you have to be when you
[2:26:14] are eating the work you sit on the edge
[2:26:17] of your
[2:26:18] chair you want to hear
[2:26:20] com come on come on come on when the
[2:26:23] picture stops to drink some water you
[2:26:27] can't wait please come on come on that
[2:26:31] is how we have to
[2:26:32] be because it is the word that gives us
[2:26:37] excitement hallelujah amen so the
[2:26:40] preachers of God will lead people by the
[2:26:45] word number one number two by the Holy
[2:26:49] Spirit
[2:26:51] God uses the
[2:26:53] word and the Holy Spirit to lead his
[2:26:57] true
[2:26:58] church Hallelujah the word alone is not
[2:27:03] enough we need the power of the holy
[2:27:06] spirit because the word is the
[2:27:11] mechanics but the power of the holy
[2:27:14] spirit is the
[2:27:16] Dynamics the holy spirit is the power
[2:27:20] the
[2:27:21] word the word and the Holy Spirit is
[2:27:25] inter
[2:27:27] together glory to God and when the Holy
[2:27:30] Spirit is in the church you will see the
[2:27:33] gifts being
[2:27:34] manifested you will see tongues being
[2:27:37] spoken you will hear interpretation of
[2:27:39] Tong you will see preachers preaching
[2:27:42] under
[2:27:43] the anointing of the Holy
[2:27:46] Ghost you will see someone singing a
[2:27:48] song
[2:27:50] and leading people into
[2:27:52] tears hallelujah what is that is the
[2:27:56] power of the Holy Spirit you will see
[2:27:58] someone playing the
[2:28:00] piano amen that's the
[2:28:02] mechanics but the power of the Holy
[2:28:04] Ghost will come upon him and when he
[2:28:08] begins to play even he himself will be
[2:28:11] lost in his
[2:28:13] presence that is what we
[2:28:16] need that is what we need can you shout
[2:28:19] amen
[2:28:21] oh Hallelujah am in the Church of
[2:28:24] brother
[2:28:25] Bram one sister they were singing a

[2:28:45] musician that we will enter the spirit
[2:28:48] when we are entering into it
[2:28:51] Hallelujah and this sister as she was
[2:28:54] playing she entered the spirit and as
[2:28:58] she went into the spirit she stopped
[2:29:01] playing and she began jumping and
[2:29:05] worshiping God and when she did that the
[2:29:09] Holy Spirit has
[2:29:12] fingers Hallelujah am the Holy Spirit
[2:29:15] came in the church and began playing
[2:29:18] that piano
[2:29:20] this happened
[2:29:22] friends the piano continued
[2:29:25] playing the song was the great physic
[2:29:28] now is
[2:29:30] here that is the God we believe
[2:29:34] in Hallelujah am but many times when the
[2:29:38] Holy Spirit falls down upon us you hear
[2:29:41] some people who
[2:29:43] know the person that was eating their
[2:29:47] mucus they know the person that f
[2:29:53] and how they
[2:29:54] fell they know even how their body was

[2:30:01] people are in are kind of
[2:30:04] people they don't they can't enter the
[2:30:07] spirit but God is looking for men and
[2:30:11] women who will worship Him in spirit in
[2:30:16] spirit but also in Truth where will you
[2:30:20] find those people they are not in the
[2:30:23] Catholic Catholic movement they not in

[2:34:57] another
[2:35:00] religion some
[2:35:02] men crept in
[2:35:05] way is it a crime to talk about
[2:35:14] them we are going to talk
[2:35:17] about they have not only stopped in
[2:35:21] Catholicism come on up into
[2:35:24] pcis you find them especially women that
[2:35:27] ones who are always overtaken by these
[2:35:30] things Pastor I have this thing
[2:35:33] disturbing I can't get married this man
[2:35:37] came he went this came he went don't
[2:35:40] worry my daughter I'm going to deliver
[2:35:43] you yes I need
[2:35:45] deliverance and you are getting some of
[2:35:47] these young ladies in the message to
[2:35:49] they also looking for
[2:35:54] deliverance if you need
[2:35:56] Deliverance go in your prayer
[2:35:58] closes receive the holy ghost seek for
[2:36:02] the Holy Spirit until you are filled in
[2:36:05] your
[2:36:05] heart if you not filled with your with
[2:36:08] the Holy Spirit the Deliverance you seek
[2:36:10] you never get
[2:36:11] it no man can deliver you only God
[2:36:16] can and we see they go there and before
[2:36:19] you know it the man of God is telling
[2:36:21] them you know I need to deliver you and
[2:36:24] you know I need to anoint you and I need
[2:36:26] to anoint your all body and then I pray
[2:36:29] over you and then I pray over
[2:36:32] you Pastor Prophet what kind of prayer
[2:36:36] is this and the women are
[2:36:42] deceived because they think the man of
[2:36:46] God is the one with the anointing
[2:36:50] I want him to touch me I want him when
[2:36:53] when he touches listen we have been
[2:36:56] delivered from that Spirit
[2:36:59] ofis there is no one man with power or
[2:37:03] anointing all of you have the power and
[2:37:06] anointing Hallelujah we have it because
[2:37:10] the Bible says we are a royal
[2:37:14] priesthood all of us as long as you
[2:37:17] believe this sign shall follow
[2:37:21] them but the spirit of
[2:37:23] nanism has taken away that power that
[2:37:27] signs and wonders they are giving to a
[2:37:30] people a dead
[2:37:33] God that only they have the power to
[2:37:38] awake but God we serve each of us he can
[2:37:43] hear us we don't need a
[2:37:47] mediator we don't need a mediator
[2:37:50] our mediator is Jesus Christ Our
[2:37:53] mediator is the Holy
[2:37:54] Ghost we don't need an Arch Bishop we
[2:37:57] don't need a pop amen our Arch Bishop
[2:38:01] amen is Jesus Christ he said is the
[2:38:04] bishop of our
[2:38:06] soul that's what the message has done it
[2:38:09] has delivered
[2:38:10] us and now we are contending for the
[2:38:15] original taking away the Holy Ghost and
[2:38:18] swapping it
[2:38:20] priesthood you see what it was it
[2:38:24] finally became in the church here it was
[2:38:26] deeds and then in this place became a
[2:38:30] doctr in pamos and
[2:38:33] in it took
[2:38:37] over is the dominating female
[2:38:42] AG that's when we find the Roman
[2:38:44] Catholic
[2:38:46] Church took over the whole world
[2:38:50] and that's why you you wonder why we
[2:38:52] have Catholicism as the biggest religion
[2:38:54] in the
[2:38:56] world they had even an
[2:38:59] army which would kill
[2:39:01] you
[2:39:03] physically because they had the power of
[2:39:04] the
[2:39:06] state you resented the
[2:39:09] church because they say that there was
[2:39:11] the true
[2:39:13] church and that Spirit took over the
[2:39:15] whole
[2:39:16] world and when Luther came out could and
[2:39:19] stay that way it went right back and
[2:39:22] took over
[2:39:23] again Bishops Cardinals Arch
[2:39:26] Bishops who in this who in the world
[2:39:29] world is the head of God's
[2:39:33] Church they ask you what who is the head
[2:39:35] of your

[2:49:19] we talking about this wheat and the
[2:49:29] tears okay the wheat and the
[2:49:32] Tails which from the first age until now
[2:49:36] have grown side by
[2:49:40] side they are now
[2:49:43] harvesting what set out to
[2:49:47] accomplish has finally come to
[2:49:50] pass with all the might of the
[2:49:53] organization of the false
[2:49:57] Church turns from any vage of
[2:50:01] Truth and with political
[2:50:05] might reinforces herself with State
[2:50:12] backing I'm coming to that even here in
[2:50:14] Uganda we have it
[2:50:15] now and sets out to eradicate forever
[2:50:18] the True
[2:50:23] Believer please don't be here and you
[2:50:26] miss this it will be the biggest mistake
[2:50:28] of your
[2:50:30] life because this is
[2:50:32] prophetic it's already happening Even in
[2:50:34] our
[2:50:35] country they have the false
[2:50:38] Doctrine they will unite the whole
[2:50:41] church and they will have political
[2:50:44] power government
[2:50:46] supporting and all for what to eradicate
[2:50:51] the True
[2:50:54] Believer you even finding our own
[2:50:57] Pentecostal
[2:50:58] preachers now wearing
[2:51:03] gowns like their
[2:51:08] mother the one the Bible talks about in
[2:51:10] Revelation 17 they came out but now they
[2:51:13] are going
[2:51:16] back is prophesied
[2:51:19] it's not only what they doing it also it
[2:51:22] is something that was
[2:51:24] prophesied but just when she's about to
[2:51:27] accomplish her cowardly plot to whe the
[2:51:30] wheat is gathered into the
[2:51:34] [Music]
[2:51:39] Ghana they have United their World
[2:51:42] Council of
[2:51:44] churches we are we are going to have a
[2:51:47] new world order
[2:51:52] whereby Rome will rule the whole
[2:51:57] world the pope will have no longer only
[2:52:01] religious
[2:52:03] power but it will be backed by political
[2:52:09] power backed by economic
[2:52:12] power literally his word will be
[2:52:15] low and the Bible would say if to those
[2:52:19] who do not have the mark of the
[2:52:23] beast they will be
[2:52:26] persecuted how do you receive the mark
[2:52:29] of the
[2:52:30] beast by joining their
[2:52:34] councel by joining their
[2:52:37] Federation by joining their false
[2:52:42] Unity why is it a false
[2:52:45] Unity because it is a Unity that is not
[2:52:47] unifying people to the
[2:52:51] word it is unifying the people to
[2:52:53] something
[2:52:56] else and by joining that because the
[2:53:00] Bible says brother some that they
[2:53:03] receive the
[2:53:05] mark either by their right
[2:53:07] hand or by their
[2:53:10] forehead why forehead you will either
[2:53:13] have to believe the false
[2:53:16] teachings that is the forehead it shows
[2:53:19] intellect understanding faith belief or
[2:53:24] by the right hand you don't have to
[2:53:26] believe what you
[2:53:28] believe just agree with
[2:53:31] us let us
[2:53:34] unite let us be
[2:53:36] one and you are
[2:53:38] seeing
[2:53:40] Islam
[2:53:43] Catholicism p and all the other
[2:53:47] denominations coming
[2:53:50] together we are one we are one they
[2:53:54] fulfilling scripture very busy receiving
[2:53:57] the mark
[2:53:58] of and they don't
[2:54:02] know
[2:54:04] but what is it
[2:54:07] for it is for the they
[2:54:11] plotting to eradicate the True
[2:54:15] Believer they are plotting
[2:54:18] to completely remove the True Believer
[2:54:20] from the
[2:54:22] Earth as it was in the
[2:54:25] beginning when Cain killed
[2:54:27] AB that is the plot of the
[2:54:30] devil but the prophet of God says here
[2:54:34] just when she is about to accomplish her
[2:54:36] cowardly
[2:54:39] plot the
[2:54:41] we the bride the True Church the true
[2:54:46] vine will be gathered into the
[2:54:50] G Hallelujah we are going to the
[2:54:53] Ghana we are going to the rapture we are
[2:54:57] going to
[2:54:58] heaven just
[2:55:00] before the
[2:55:02] tribulation there is no way we can be
[2:55:05] persecuted by the false
[2:55:09] Church remember we are in the
[2:55:11] age of the flying
[2:55:14] eego there are four beasts my dear
[2:55:19] the Bible speaks
[2:55:21] about in The Book of
[2:55:24] Revelation are you still here what is
[2:55:27] the first one everybody
[2:55:30] shouting
[2:55:32] lion what's the second one
[2:55:36] o the ones who don't read the Bible are
[2:55:38] seeing stars
[2:55:39] now go and read your Bible what is the
[2:55:42] third
[2:55:43] one face of mank what is the fourth one
[2:55:48] flying
[2:55:50] eag now these are four
[2:55:54] anointings of God to
[2:55:58] combat the four
[2:56:01] anointings of
[2:56:03] Satan where do we get this in the
[2:56:06] revelation of the
[2:56:07] [Music]
[2:56:08] seals because there he speaks about the
[2:56:10] four
[2:56:12] anointed of
[2:56:14] Satan it comes
[2:56:16] first in the white horse
[2:56:20] rider he comes
[2:56:22] riding and everybody
[2:56:25] said he is on the White Horse that is
[2:56:28] Jesus but God sent a prophet in our
[2:56:31] generation that came and said Is Not
[2:56:34] Jesus he's not Jesus and that was the
[2:56:37] revelation of the first
[2:56:39] SE is not Jesus it has been revealed to
[2:56:43] me because he is he that sat on that
[2:56:46] horse
[2:56:48] had a
[2:56:49] bow but he had no
[2:56:51] Arrow which means he can't shoot to
[2:56:56] kill is a
[2:57:01] BL but White
[2:57:03] Horse because he's
[2:57:07] riding as a righteous
[2:57:10] one but he's not a
[2:57:12] rightous he's perverting the
[2:57:15] truth of God into a life
[2:57:19] so he's a
[2:57:22] deceiver amen that's why you had a white
[2:57:25] horse many received it because they
[2:57:28] thought it was the
[2:57:29] truth but it was the false church it was
[2:57:32] the false Spirit the spirit of the
[2:57:35] Antichrist they say we have the big
[2:57:38] churches we have the big pastors the
[2:57:41] government accept us we are more than
[2:57:44] you but that is a deception
[2:57:49] if what they teaching is not in the
[2:57:52] Bible then it is
[2:57:55] deception amen and the White Horse was
[2:58:00] converted by the by The
[2:58:03] Lion The anointing of God that he had
[2:58:06] risen deception came in and God used the
[2:58:10] anointing of a
[2:58:12] li lion means
[2:58:15] Purity purity of the word
[2:58:18] power
[2:58:20] truth lion oh my I wish I would go in
[2:58:24] details and then comes the next horse
[2:58:27] rider everybody who was
[2:58:30] he the red horse
[2:58:34] rider read the book of
[2:58:37] Revelation how many I enjoying this
[2:58:39] tonight how many I enjoying this
[2:58:42] tonight the red horse rider
[2:58:45] brother what was he the same
[2:58:48] devil that
[2:58:51] came as a white horse
[2:58:54] rider he realized the more I deceive
[2:58:57] these
[2:58:58] people the more they
[2:59:00] multiplying we are now in church
[2:59:03] history he realized he can't finish the
[2:59:08] Believers he realized they are
[2:59:11] unstoppable he can't deceive them he
[2:59:14] can't deceive them so brother M what he
[2:59:16] decided to do
[2:59:18] was to change
[2:59:19] colors let me tell you Church the devil
[2:59:22] has tried to change colors in
[2:59:24] you but still can't finish you because
[2:59:27] there is an anointing on
[2:59:29] you a powerful
[2:59:31] anointing because the Bible says when
[2:59:33] the Devil comes in like a
[2:59:36] flag the spirit of God raises
[2:59:40] standard raise
[2:59:42] standard so now the devil came he said
[2:59:45] let me change colors he came as a red
[2:59:48] hor
[2:59:48] Rider to do what to
[2:59:52] bring
[2:59:54] death to bring
[2:59:57] persecution he
[3:00:00] persecuted the
[3:00:01] church like never
[3:00:04] before that that's the time of the
[3:00:07] matters not the matters we are
[3:00:11] seeing we're talking about the matters
[3:00:14] in the Dark
[3:00:16] Ages forget about these ones who died
[3:00:20] for the false
[3:00:21] Church we're talking about the ones who
[3:00:23] died for this
[3:00:25] world hallelujah amen and this you know
[3:00:30] the the Catholic
[3:00:33] Church these things are really
[3:00:36] surprising the Catholic
[3:00:38] system and when I talk about it I don't
[3:00:41] have any problem with the people
[3:00:43] there I'm talking about the false Church
[3:00:46] system people there our
[3:00:48] brothers many of them will believe this
[3:00:52] message I'm talking about the wrong or
[3:00:53] false Church
[3:00:56] system the same system that claims now
[3:01:00] they you know worshiping
[3:01:04] matters they are the same one who killed
[3:01:06] Believers in the
[3:01:09] dark you saw the Pope the current pop he
[3:01:13] was
[3:01:14] apologizing for the millions not
[3:01:16] hundreds of thousands
[3:01:22] millions of the
[3:01:24] Christians they killed the Catholic
[3:01:28] denomination
[3:01:32] K in Cold
[3:01:36] Blood many of them they will take women
[3:01:41] who have pregnant like
[3:01:43] sister take the
[3:01:46] arena and they tell them now are you
[3:01:50] ready to recant your
[3:01:53] faith
[3:01:56] oh you are
[3:01:58] not if you're not you ready to
[3:02:00] recant and
[3:02:02] accept this our church to be the only
[3:02:04] true
[3:02:06] church then you can
[3:02:09] go and the women would say I Rec I
[3:02:14] refuse to to
[3:02:16] recant I refuse to
[3:02:19] I contend for the
[3:02:21] faith they would release those wild
[3:02:26] bears rap their stomachs
[3:02:29] AP and they would
[3:02:32] die because of loss of
[3:02:36] blood they would reap their
[3:02:38] Belles take their children feed them to
[3:02:42] this
[3:02:42] business and they would watch them die
[3:02:46] and others were scared
[3:02:49] for us we
[3:02:51] Catholics because of fear of
[3:02:54] death and that's how they got the
[3:02:57] numbers they did not
[3:03:03] evangelize praise the name of the Lord
[3:03:06] no no one can imprison
[3:03:08] me because these are
[3:03:12] facts it can even be taken to the court
[3:03:14] of law it is facts
[3:03:18] facts is written
[3:03:21] down we we have
[3:03:24] evidence history has
[3:03:26] it you cannot remove
[3:03:28] it and they killed
[3:03:31] Believers even the Bible in the Book of
[3:03:34] Revelation it
[3:03:36] prophesied before it happened he said
[3:03:39] that woman she drunken with the blood of
[3:03:42] the
[3:03:44] Saints because God knew she would do
[3:03:47] that
[3:03:49] and after they did it then they would
[3:03:52] make them saints
[3:03:54] later they killed Peter they buried him
[3:03:57] in
[3:04:00] Basilica in vaan they said Peter is now
[3:04:03] a
[3:04:04] saint is even our first
[3:04:07] pop Peter a first
[3:04:09] pop that man was a mared
[3:04:13] man so if Peter was a
[3:04:16] pope then he was my
[3:04:18] pop not their Pope it means more
[3:04:21] Catholic than they
[3:04:26] are these are
[3:04:28] facts are you hearing me church I told
[3:04:32] you I'm going to our principles the
[3:04:35] foundations these are
[3:04:37] facts and they have deceived the whole
[3:04:40] world it's a it's a false
[3:04:43] Vine it's a false Church system
[3:04:47] The Men Who crept in our
[3:04:51] awars and their number one uh uh
[3:04:58] Target is to kill the True Believer to
[3:05:01] eradicate the heart from the
[3:05:03] world but you cannot because we in our
[3:05:09] generation we don't even these believers
[3:05:11] who were
[3:05:13] killed they were killed but you see why
[3:05:16] did they accept to
[3:05:19] die because God gave them an
[3:05:23] anointing the anointing of the
[3:05:26] ox the ox is a burden of
[3:05:32] sacrifice they were willing they were
[3:05:34] anointed to
[3:05:36] die so the more they
[3:05:38] killed the more people were willing to
[3:05:41] Die the devil said these people are
[3:05:44] not what can I do he changed colors
[3:05:48] he now came in the third
[3:05:51] color he came as a black
[3:05:54] horse to
[3:05:56] bring
[3:05:58] death to bring death but even
[3:06:02] then God was still
[3:06:05] moving when the devil came as a
[3:06:08] black what kind of
[3:06:11] death what kind of famine and
[3:06:14] death we notice the Bible speaks of it
[3:06:18] that in the end time there will be
[3:06:21] fine not of food or water but femine of
[3:06:25] the
[3:06:25] word because if people are hungry they
[3:06:28] will
[3:06:29] die so the devil now he said
[3:06:33] oh it is what they
[3:06:36] believe let me take the word from
[3:06:40] them and we notice it was at that time
[3:06:44] they passed
[3:06:45] laws you can't read the Bible
[3:06:49] and that's why up to today Roman
[3:06:53] Catholics don't
[3:06:55] read they beginning
[3:06:57] nowadays but very few it was not
[3:07:02] allowed because those who
[3:07:04] did were killed in Cold
[3:07:08] Blood The Man Who translated this
[3:07:11] Bible his name is William
[3:07:14] Tinder he was killed they tied him on a
[3:07:18] stick and put firewood who did that the
[3:07:22] Catholic church and they put fire and
[3:07:26] the man died but he died
[3:07:29] believing he contended for the
[3:07:32] faith and they got this Bible it is said
[3:07:35] in
[3:07:36] history they would buy from him
[3:07:38] thousands of
[3:07:40] Bibles and you know how he was selling
[3:07:42] the
[3:07:43] Bibles he wasn't selling them in the
[3:07:46] open he would himself
[3:07:48] somewhere and and and you know you know
[3:07:51] get this you know feeds of the
[3:07:55] animals and put those bibles
[3:07:58] inside and then behave as if he's
[3:08:00] selling
[3:08:02] feeds and the Catholic Church would buy
[3:08:06] thousands of Bibles from
[3:08:07] him and they would burn
[3:08:10] them in a b to stop him but history has
[3:08:14] it that he would take the money they had
[3:08:17] given him
[3:08:19] and he would use it to produce more
[3:08:22] Bibles contending for the
[3:08:24] faith Hallelujah and they try to burn
[3:08:27] these Bibles the King James
[3:08:30] versioning James they have never
[3:08:32] finished it from the world I have a copy
[3:08:35] of it here
[3:08:36] today you have a copy that's why you
[3:08:39] should read it if the devil didn't want
[3:08:41] you to read it it mean there is
[3:08:43] something in there he didn't want you to
[3:08:45] know don't accept that the devil to
[3:08:47] Blind
[3:08:48] you go and read your
[3:08:51] Bible there is something the devil
[3:08:53] doesn't want you to
[3:08:54] know we must be
[3:08:58] enlightened the devil wants us to be
[3:09:00] blind but we refuse to be
[3:09:03] blind just say it I refuse to be
[3:09:08] blind hallelujah hallelujah amen and we
[3:09:12] notice they they try to kill them and
[3:09:15] bring famine and even the Bible which
[3:09:18] was translated at that
[3:09:20] time was only from in
[3:09:23] Latin and and the Latin was also not
[3:09:28] accurate but God you know he brought the
[3:09:32] anointing of face of a
[3:09:35] man face is where intelligence
[3:09:38] is knowledge two things happened number
[3:09:43] one God anointed men with the
[3:09:47] understanding
[3:09:48] of
[3:09:49] scripture like William tind that he knew
[3:09:52] many
[3:09:54] languages he knew
[3:09:56] Latin he knew Greek he knew Hebrew he
[3:10:00] knew English and he could interpret this
[3:10:03] Bible in the right way and other men
[3:10:07] like John W and others men who were
[3:10:10] anointed and another man to invent what
[3:10:14] we call the printing press
[3:10:22] at first my friends were in
[3:10:26] 2024 at first everybody was
[3:10:30] writing and they would not write with a
[3:10:33] pen they were writing with with
[3:10:38] feathers from from
[3:10:40] hands
[3:10:42] chicken they would pull it
[3:10:44] out and get ink
[3:10:48] from some of these some things with
[3:10:50] ink they would get it and then dip the
[3:10:54] the
[3:10:56] feather inside the
[3:10:58] ink and they would
[3:11:01] write but imagine if you want 20 million
[3:11:06] people to read the
[3:11:08] Bible how many can you
[3:11:12] write so
[3:11:14] God who is riching
[3:11:17] he anointed a
[3:11:19] man with an anointing to have
[3:11:23] knowledge and he
[3:11:25] invented the printing
[3:11:30] press it is said the company or the man
[3:11:33] who invented
[3:11:36] it went
[3:11:38] bankrupt and he stopped the
[3:11:40] business and he sold it to the people
[3:11:43] who were doing the
[3:11:45] Bible it wasn't for them
[3:11:48] it was for
[3:11:50] us hallelujah God had you in
[3:11:55] mind me in
[3:11:57] mind Hallelujah the anointing of a face
[3:12:00] of man and we are in the last age and in

[3:14:43] fation in this age
[3:14:48] her fuit would mature and
[3:14:51] ripen that is correct the evil spirited
[3:14:57] Church full of
[3:14:59] iniquity will be revealed as the
[3:15:01] mastered seed that grew into a tree
[3:15:03] wherein L the fs of the
[3:15:10] air at her head will be the Antichrist
[3:15:14] the mystery of iniquity
[3:15:18] all this is true and if this is true now

[3:15:24] then it must also
[3:15:26] be through that the bride

[3:15:34] ripeness shall be an identification with
[3:15:37] her
[3:15:40] Lord by means of the
[3:15:45] word and her head
[3:15:48] will who will come to her is the mystery
[3:15:51] of
[3:15:54] godliness which indeed is
[3:15:59] Christ and as the false church with all
[3:16:02] kinding and diabolical power made up a
[3:16:04] political
[3:16:09] force physical
[3:16:11] force and the Demons of
[3:16:13] Darkness as they come against this True
[3:16:16] Vine
[3:16:18] the True Vine with the fullness of the
[3:16:21] spirit and the word will do the very Act
[3:16:25] of
[3:16:26] power that Jesus
[3:16:29] did hallelujah amen the same power the
[3:16:33] same anointing you are not talking about
[3:16:36] chap chip
[3:16:37] Miracles we are talking about
[3:16:40] manifestation of the power of
[3:16:43] God right through the true church
[3:16:47] then as she nears her
[3:16:50] headstone becoming like him through the
[3:16:54] word Jesus will come that the bride and
[3:16:58] groom may be forever United
[3:17:03] as
[3:17:05] already the visible manifestations of
[3:17:07] what I have been telling you are seen
[3:17:09] all around
[3:17:13] us we have seen even in little assembly
[3:17:17] here the move of the spirit and we
[3:17:21] should keep on burning we should keep on
[3:17:23] going like that the presence of God
[3:17:26] around
[3:17:28] us amen I we shall go in the testimonies
[3:17:32] The ecumenical
[3:17:33] move of the is
[3:17:37] factual but also it is a
[3:17:42] fact that the prophet of the last age
[3:17:47] must be bringing forth a
[3:17:49] message from God that will forun the the
[3:17:53] coming of our Lord Jesus
[3:17:56] Christ for by his
[3:17:58] message will the hearts of the
[3:18:01] children be turned back to the
[3:18:03] Pentecostal
[3:18:04] father and with the restoration of the
[3:18:08] word oh are you hearing this sister
[3:18:11] Juliet by the restoration of the word
[3:18:15] will come the restoration of
[3:18:20] is the word
[3:18:22] restored I ask you is the word
[3:18:25] restored then the power is restored
[3:18:29] also not to me only not to each of
[3:18:34] us we've got the
[3:18:36] power in the name of Jesus really have
[3:18:40] you God have
[3:18:42] power in the name of the
[3:18:45] Lord where
[3:18:47] Satan raes
[3:18:50] what some of you are not singing don't
[3:18:52] you
[3:18:54] go Oh in the name of the Lord hallelujah
[3:18:59] amen the restoration of power also
[3:19:02] comes with the restoration of the
[3:19:05] [Music]
[3:19:06] work what crucial times are these in
[3:19:09] which we
[3:19:11] live how careful we must be that we
[3:19:13] remain true to the word to this word
[3:19:19] and not take from it or to
[3:19:22] it for he would speak where God has not
[3:19:25] spoken makes him a
[3:19:28] liar what I have particularly in mind is
[3:19:32] this about the turn of the
[3:19:36] century the hunger for God that was
[3:19:38] generated in the Philadelphian
[3:19:43] age and brought a cry of the spirit of
[3:19:46] God
[3:19:48] and this was mainly L by a black
[3:19:52] man in America called Street
[3:19:57] Place Street Brother Martin what was the
[3:19:59] name of that man that that brother black
[3:20:02] brother that had you know was was really
[3:20:06] you know leading people to seek the Holy
[3:20:09] Ghost and when they the cry was
[3:20:13] answered by sending forth manifestation
[3:20:15] in tongues
[3:20:20] interpretation and
[3:20:22] prophecy a group immediately now before
[3:20:24] we continue here these people were all
[3:20:27] coming together praying and crying at at
[3:20:30] the end of the Philadelphian Church
[3:20:33] age people desired to see God people
[3:20:36] were hungry for the
[3:20:39] Supernatural and as they were praying
[3:20:40] God came
[3:20:41] down ATA
[3:20:44] Street and he filled them with the Holy
[3:20:46] Ghost
[3:20:47] men began to speak in
[3:20:50] Tong and interpret and
[3:20:53] prophesy I tell you this was a real move
[3:20:56] of
[3:20:57] God it was the real
[3:21:00] anointing okay but he says
[3:21:03] immediately a
[3:21:05] group most contrary to the
[3:21:08] word it Drew up a
[3:21:11] doctrine that tongues was the evidence
[3:21:14] of being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[3:21:18] and these are now the ones who who I'm
[3:21:19] talking about they're going
[3:21:22] back they going back to their mother
[3:21:25] they're dressing like their mother
[3:21:27] they're talking like their
[3:21:28] mother they are called
[3:21:30] Pentecostals but they look like
[3:21:34] Catholics they going back to their
[3:21:36] mother and they denominated and the
[3:21:39] prophet would say when they denominate
[3:21:41] they
[3:21:43] die when any movement denominates it
[3:21:46] dies
[3:21:48] because God does not use
[3:21:51] denominations
[3:21:53] period God uses his
[3:21:56] word not
[3:22:00] denominations they denominated and they
[3:22:03] died and they said if you are not
[3:22:05] talking
[3:22:07] tongues it means you don't have the Holy
[3:22:10] Spirit and some of them even took up to
[3:22:13] teaching people how to talk tongues
[3:22:17] so don't say just
[3:22:19] say many times and then
[3:22:23] say then now it means you when you say
[3:22:26] it many times you lose your mind and it
[3:22:30] means now you have
[3:22:32] the thank God for the
[3:22:35] message thank God for the
[3:22:38] message yeah listen to what the message
[3:22:40] of Our Generation
[3:22:42] teaches the T were manifestation
[3:22:47] of the spirit but not the evidence of
[3:22:51] the
[3:22:55] spirit someone can speak tongues and go
[3:22:58] to
[3:23:00] hell someone can actually speak Tong
[3:23:03] when they are not filled with the Holy
[3:23:06] Ghost but tongues are a manifestation of
[3:23:10] the
[3:23:13] spirit but they are not manifest of the
[3:23:17] evidence of the indwelling of the Holy
[3:23:19] Ghost in the
[3:23:25] individual it is a gift just like
[3:23:28] preaching is a
[3:23:29] gift because the Holy Ghost is coming on
[3:23:32] me to
[3:23:33] preach it does not mean I have a ticket
[3:23:36] to
[3:23:37] Heaven you can preach and still go to
[3:23:41] hell they came and said didn't we preach
[3:23:43] in your name did we raise the dead in
[3:23:45] your name
[3:23:47] didn't we speak Tong
[3:23:49] in you did not say you did not do those
[3:23:52] things you even rais the dead yes but go
[3:23:56] away from me doers of
[3:24:00] iniquity they knew the
[3:24:02] word but they did not love the
[3:24:05] word they loveed their denomination more
[3:24:08] than the
[3:24:11] word they refus to submit themselves to
[3:24:15] the thank God we have received a prophet
[3:24:19] messenger who has restored back us back
[3:24:21] to the foundations amen of the
[3:24:25] faith we now know that tongues must also
[3:24:30] be in the
[3:24:32] church manifestation of the gifts and we
[3:24:35] have seen it happening in our church
[3:24:38] assembly and we want more of
[3:24:43] it it must be there
[3:24:47] had some believer saying no now that we
[3:24:49] have believe the
[3:24:51] message don't believe in those things
[3:24:54] and you were in a
[3:24:56] church four five 10
[3:25:00] years no one
[3:25:03] gift no prophecy no T no gift of healing
[3:25:08] nothing and you claim to be a believer
[3:25:10] of the
[3:25:11] message there is a problem
[3:25:13] somewhere there is a problem somewhere
[3:25:17] because he must manifest his
[3:25:23] presence let us be like that brother
[3:25:27] Gideon when when they were always being
[3:25:30] taken by the gibeonites and other
[3:25:32] people whenever they harest they come
[3:25:35] and one day the angel of the Lord came
[3:25:39] and he found gide
[3:25:41] hiding and he told Gideon oh th man of
[3:25:45] Val
[3:25:47] God is with you he said Angel wait what
[3:25:50] did you say if God is with with us where
[3:25:53] are his
[3:25:56] miracles hallelujah hallelujah if we
[3:25:59] claim to have the
[3:26:00] message where are the
[3:26:02] Miracles where are the signs and wonders
[3:26:05] where is the manifestation of the Holy
[3:26:09] Ghost where is
[3:26:11] it and you find our churches are quiet
[3:26:15] and dead like a mo
[3:26:19] [Music]
[3:26:20] I will tell you if that's one of our
[3:26:21] churches here get out of
[3:26:27] it yes sir because it's a Same Spirit we
[3:26:31] are
[3:26:33] fighting getting back to the
[3:26:36] original containing for the
[3:26:39] faith and whenever you see that kind of
[3:26:43] quietness that kind of Silence where you
[3:26:46] preaching the word and people are like
[3:26:50] rocks it means there is a lot of sin
[3:26:52] going
[3:26:54] on there is a lot of immorality going on
[3:26:57] there is a lot of back back backward
[3:26:59] sins going
[3:27:04] on but if you are one of them there is
[3:27:08] still amen hallelujah there is a
[3:27:12] blood flowing from calvar
[3:27:16] wash you white as snow and cleanse you
[3:27:19] and save you and red you and fill you
[3:27:22] with the Holy
[3:27:25] Ghost
[3:27:26] amen we want that original
[3:27:29] church we are containing for the
[3:27:39] original that fality of the doctrine
[3:27:42] canot only be seen by a lack of
[3:27:43] scripture to sub substantiate it but
[3:27:46] those who subscribe to the doctrine
[3:27:48] immediately organized on the basis of
[3:27:49] the doctrine as Pentecostals of course
[3:27:52] we know that amen the doctrine of t
[3:28:01] as subscrib to it as a Doctrine and they
[3:28:04] organized on the basis of the
[3:28:09] doct proving that they were not in the
[3:28:11] truth as they would have people believe
[3:28:16] not like I said we believe in
[3:28:18] tongues but Tong tongues are a
[3:28:24] manifestation not an Evidence you that
[3:28:27] speak of tongues are filled with the
[3:28:28] Holy
[3:28:31] Ghost can can the speaker can the
[3:28:33] Speaker of tongues be filled with the
[3:28:34] Holy
[3:28:36] Ghost yes but both the one filled and
[3:28:40] the one not filled can both have the
[3:28:42] anointing upon them and they can speak
[3:28:44] tongues
[3:28:50] the prophet that the Bible says the
[3:28:52] gifts and the calling of God are without
[3:28:57] repentance you can be a sinner and yet
[3:29:02] gifted is that right have you not seen
[3:29:04] people who are gifted and yet they not
[3:29:07] converted and so it's a gift that comes
[3:29:11] from God not from the Devil by the way
[3:29:14] from God you see he says the rain falls
[3:29:17] on the just and the
[3:29:20] unjust both The Bad and The Good the
[3:29:22] Sinners and the
[3:29:23] righteous the rain is the holy
[3:29:26] spirit he's not saying feeling them he's
[3:29:29] saying falls upon them he's saying they
[3:29:32] receive the anointing of it so they get
[3:29:35] anointed in their Spirit but they are
[3:29:37] not filled in their
[3:29:39] soul and that's why oh Hallelujah the
[3:29:41] message has been restored to us
[3:29:43] now to go back to the original
[3:29:47] whereby you cannot be filled with the
[3:29:49] Holy Ghost unless you believe the true
[3:29:53] word the true word is the Original
[3:29:57] Seed which will make you able to receive
[3:30:00] the Holy
[3:30:02] Spirit are you hearing me
[3:30:05] now and even the tongues they
[3:30:08] speak in their
[3:30:10] churches let me come to you and tell you
[3:30:13] this they are not the real Pentecost
[3:30:16] bial
[3:30:18] times the place where I see
[3:30:22] them is the Tower of
[3:30:25] [Music]
[3:30:26] B come up here brother you have a very
[3:30:30] good language I love it come you have a
[3:30:32] very good one come here you have a very
[3:30:33] good one come come come come look this
[3:30:37] one is a
[3:30:38] Manda do you
[3:30:40] know you not can you speak it very well
[3:30:43] but you can speak it and you speak
[3:30:48] you speak wonderful do I have a
[3:30:51] brother no he's not here
[3:30:54] today all right so we have we have a we
[3:30:58] have we have
[3:31:01] and now I want us to speak something to
[3:31:06] these
[3:31:07] people each of us at the same time 1 2 3
[3:31:11] go
[3:31:16] can you speak
[3:31:43] brother and this one said what believe
[3:31:47] okay now whatever you said I want you to
[3:31:48] say it at a go 1 2 3
[3:31:55] go you are laughing but we are giving
[3:31:58] you a
[3:32:00] message but you can't understand it
[3:32:03] because is all a
[3:32:05] confusion number one we all speaking at
[3:32:08] a go that's a confusion number two there
[3:32:12] is no
[3:32:14] interpretation Paul told it clear
[3:32:17] don't do it like that one speak fast and
[3:32:21] another
[3:32:22] one after that another one speak and
[3:32:26] another he says in the church
[3:32:29] service maximum
[3:32:32] three maximum
[3:32:35] three maximum otherwise we will be in
[3:32:39] the service of Tong
[3:32:41] and and also he says he says if there is
[3:32:45] no inter
[3:32:47] we will not stop you brother but we
[3:32:49] shall tell you to go at home and
[3:32:53] pray that you may
[3:32:55] interpret if you can't interpret someone
[3:32:58] should interpret what you're saying but
[3:33:00] if every time you speaking in Tong in
[3:33:04] church every time you're speaking in
[3:33:06] Tong in church no one is interpreting
[3:33:09] you then you should go and first pray
[3:33:13] that you may interpret
[3:33:17] but if also you can't interpret after
[3:33:21] prayer Pray them in your
[3:33:24] house but in the church pray with words
[3:33:28] people can
[3:33:30] understand now many message
[3:33:32] believers they love that ending
[3:33:35] there Paul was not preaching
[3:33:39] against he was setting the church in
[3:33:42] order he was telling them how Tong
[3:33:45] should operate
[3:33:49] but for us we silence them and others be
[3:33:52] like I feel like talking T but I can't
[3:33:54] interpret I can't interpret don't worry
[3:33:57] just say it speak it if it is of god he
[3:34:02] will raise an
[3:34:05] interpreter hallelujah hallelujah these
[3:34:07] are Bible
[3:34:08] principles so we believe in tongues but
[3:34:12] the tongues we see in the Pentecostal
[3:34:14] world it is it is the bab
[3:34:17] tongues but the T the tongues of Acts
[3:34:20] chapter
[3:34:21] 2 people will understand what you are
[3:34:25] saying it is for what for edifying the
[3:34:31] church contending for the
[3:34:34] faith now I'm trying to find a place to
[3:34:36] finish I'm already 5 minutes beyond the
[3:34:38] time I I request I I promise you all
[3:34:41] right here the original okay okay oh
[3:34:46] where was I
[3:34:48] brother man this is this is sweet how
[3:34:51] many I enjoying
[3:34:52] it it's a very it's like a very sweet
[3:34:57] pie my my my my I'm enjoying it if
[3:35:01] you're enjoying it tell your neighbor
[3:35:02] I'm
[3:35:03] enjoy oh it looked good it looked like
[3:35:05] the return of
[3:35:07] [Music]
[3:35:08] Pentecost he's talking about the
[3:35:10] Pentecostal movement now it looked like
[3:35:12] the return of
[3:35:14] Pentecost of act
[3:35:17] but it proved it
[3:35:19] wasn't it could not
[3:35:21] be because it
[3:35:23] organized that is death not
[3:35:27] life it looked so close to the real that
[3:35:30] multitudes were
[3:35:32] [Music]
[3:35:35] deceived now if it wasn't the genuine
[3:35:38] what was
[3:35:40] it don't miss this
[3:35:42] church it was the HK
[3:35:46] the
[3:35:46] cha in the green soft sheath form it
[3:35:50] like uh uh like it looked like it was
[3:35:53] the real
[3:35:56] thing but as one can go into the field
[3:35:59] and see what it looks what looks exactly
[3:36:01] like wheat and yet it is only the
[3:36:07] H for the wheat seed had not yet
[3:36:13] formed the original
[3:36:16] seed of Pentecost was to come back in
[3:36:20] the last
[3:36:24] age it had been bued
[3:36:28] at it sent up a
[3:36:32] shoot s s it grew a t at
[3:36:42] philia it was to mature at
[3:36:47] but it could not be back to the original
[3:36:52] until the word was
[3:36:54] [Music]
[3:36:59] restored amen when the seed was planted
[3:37:02] in the
[3:37:03] beginning in the days of Paul it started
[3:37:07] growing started growing and at the at
[3:37:10] the end of the Philadelphian Church
[3:37:13] age that seed
[3:37:16] brought forth what we saw here which was
[3:37:18] like a heart kind of
[3:37:20] thing and many thought that was the
[3:37:24] SE when they began speaking in Tong and
[3:37:27] healing
[3:37:28] and but it could not have been the true
[3:37:33] SE because they had all the
[3:37:36] manifestation but there was no
[3:37:38] restoration of the
[3:37:40] world where do we see the true
[3:37:43] church it must have the true
[3:37:47] word and the manifestation of the Holy
[3:37:52] Ghost so now the Pentecostal
[3:37:55] movement could not bu the original
[3:38:00] Church to not fully restore us back
[3:38:04] again we needed something
[3:38:07] more there was a promise in the Lan
[3:38:10] Church
[3:38:11] age that there will come a
[3:38:13] messenger with a
[3:38:16] of
[3:38:18] restoration Hallelujah he restore the
[3:38:23] full the Malachi for
[3:38:26] Messenger has restored to us the full
[3:38:30] word of

[4:17:06] um you know who are giv towards the land
[4:17:09] fund let us multiply it

[4:17:51] give this
[4:17:54] much give as though it is only you going
[4:17:57] to buy the church
[4:17:59] lunch and ask yourself if you're giving

[4:18:07] only is it really what you can
[4:18:10] do can you do more
[4:18:13] then do
[4:18:15] it and I promise you it's not me who
[4:18:18] promises actually the word of God
[4:18:20] promises us a blessing to those who
[4:18:23] serve god with their
[4:18:29] substance let us be a partake of
[4:18:33] this the day will
[4:18:35] come when all this shall be behind
[4:18:38] us and all those that contributed to
[4:18:41] this cause
[4:18:43] will be now the beneficiaries of those
[4:18:46] blessings now those who will not be
[4:18:50] beneficiaries of
[4:18:51] it you will not feel bad for
[4:18:55] sure because others gave and they did
