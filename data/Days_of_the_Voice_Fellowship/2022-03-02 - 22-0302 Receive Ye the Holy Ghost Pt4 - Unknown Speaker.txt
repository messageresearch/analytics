are not filled with the holy spirit whenever you are coming to the service well you know service believe that that will be your day and if you are rather filled with the holy [Music] we shall realize that all the church services we have to go to [Music] you know many people when they come to the message they think that it's all about understanding the mysteries of the message many corridors should be able to take us to the promised land be taken to someone since you because if the mysteries cannot take us to the promised land of the holy ghost of the restoration you could dissipate with the redemption then we don't need the reviewed business area maybe even creator but also we cannot be able to go to the promised land we cannot attain the redemption of our souls [Music] without having restored back to the revealed truth stereo if you can be able to control that and give me a little more bass and decrease the stereo amen when jesus christ came yes he after resurrection he was able to meet the disciples yes and this was a very special time are you listening to me this was a very special time he had already taught them for a space of three [Music] [Music] refused to follow him to the death of five questions you see when that time comes when your faith stands when you you are supposed to leave you take it to to to walk the talk to live according to your confession that is when we shall not believe us an unbeliever [Music] when the time and the moment comes like i said i know when you have to manifest the light or you know call this over them that you claim to have with organ and jewelry is when you can be able to know whether you have the holy ghost or you do not i want to get it nobody knows the disciples including apostle peter they followed jesus they believed jesus christ many christians actually speak [Music] promising that you will not do this or you will do this sequence under your let you know actually but it is jesus christ who dwells now in you that will enable you to fulfill your that kind of life whereby the things that you are tempting you and defeating you they cannot defeat you anymore are you hearing me hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord i'll come in this way apostle peter comes to our place [Music] why was he ashamed of him because he did not have the holy ghost why was he ashamed of him because his life was not yet changed [Music] is was standing there [Music] [Music] is god not the man interesting even when he was being arrested he told us he himself told us he said we should bring our swordsman [Music] are you following me now amen and so [Music] [Music] a oh yes we're going back transfusion is that blood flows in your we don't receive judgement membership by joining a church we become church members by being born into that church there is only one church of christians supporting you are not even a [Applause] he came so that you may die on the cross yet and the reason why he died because he wanted to give us the holy ghost because when he died in the grave in order for you to receive a new nation like i like act like god breathed the breath of life into adam yes so god jesus christ breathed the breath of life to the disciples yes museum and israel had a promise to result you remember the promise of israel in the book of episodes he says i'm taking it to a good land he claims this life away from us it is our promise which are faith to go to the promised land a land flowing with milk and seed and the believers but the banana says the believers went out and entered into the promised land organ they went under the anointed message of the message but the people who laughed and made fun of us they would not accept the message they perished through the rest of the animals but those who went to the promised land anybody ever get a message without an anointed message [Music] to his eating shall make you account for the lamb toxins and they were they were supposed to eat the lamb are you following me they were supposed to eat the lamb and they shall take the blood they never [Music] that is [Applause] listen to me he's destroying them in sin is security i told you the devil has no problem if you can do his work by single korean you can go to church you can even pay your tribe why aren't everyone here coming you can even give money to the church you can be the best christian christian now yet the devil has you in his standing i showed it to you and there was someone we had the other day i want you to come back and then when it realizes people mean business we are talking about antibiotics but leave your younger ones they don't know the message you may not understand that right now but i'll explain hallelujah amen he said that they had to go to the promised land like the anointed message there what was the blood homosexuality the blood was the only thing um that was going to stand before them between the people and the end of death amen whether it is the house of the israelites oh it is the house of the egyptians it did not matter the age of death had full access is and the end of death and today we have both those things and interviews we have the end of death and we have the blood to ruin a normal messiah jesus died on the bride under the cross yes yes two thousand years ago jesus there is no church passing milliliters and liters of the blood of jesus christ that blood of jesus christ oh messiah the bible in the book of first john bible what does he say again he says he calls it let me since we are doing a little teaching here let me go let me let's read that party hallelujah let us first read the first read second corinthians chapter 5 verse 19. [Music] god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and has committed them to ask the word of reconciliation first second five corinthians five verse nine verse nine biblio yes 5 17 begin from 17. therefore if any man be in christ she is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things have become new omotri and crystal register and all things are out of god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation whereas [Music] now there's quite many scriptures we can read but i think uh i i will uh all right we can we could read john 5 but for stream 5 but i think we can skip that for now it says [Music] okay you why don't you read first john 1 7 or in your and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin away hallelujah hallelujah then he says [Music] in revelation 1 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten um and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood foreign and that is why when we are in christ that is why all the things pass away that is why all things become new why because we are under the ministry of reconciliation reconciliation to reconcile means to bring back to uh to bring together two parties i could call it a restoration or restoration of friendly relationships [Applause] amen what desire to bring us back together with him because he of reconciliation [Music] so what was jesus's ministry where is that his ministry what is that what was the ministry of reconciliation on the ground on verse 19 he brings it on down to asanas and he says do we that god was in christ himself not imputing their trespasses unto them he has not and he cannot and he will not impute my trespasses tonight amen when jesus came on the earth yesterday he came with the ministry of reconciliation and he left but what has he done she has committed to us [Music] this was able to stand before the end of death [Applause] hallelujah amen now of course there were also other false prophets and we have many magicians claiming women and so ourselves with big denominations i don't care how big they are at the moment how rich they are i don't care what influence they have not about those things amen amen if you have
