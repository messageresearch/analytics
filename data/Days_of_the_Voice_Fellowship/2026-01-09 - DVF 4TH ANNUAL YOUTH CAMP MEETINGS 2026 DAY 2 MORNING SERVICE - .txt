TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You might not be seeing the miracles like you saw back there, &gt;&gt; but he's still taking you into the promised land. &gt;&gt; God is able. &gt;&gt; No matter the issue, &gt;&gt; no matter the DNA, &gt;&gt; no matter the genealogy, whatever that word is, &gt;&gt; God is able. And the scripture says, &gt;&gt; the scripture says, "Now these things were for our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted." And can I say it's a lot easier to learn from somebody else's mistake than to make it yourself than to make it yourself. Though some of us are a little more stubborn than others and we need to make the mistake before we learn, I personally would prefer to look at a life that's just gone off the rails and say I don't need to go off the rails to see what my life can be like. I can just live a good Christian life. And if you're sitting here, if you're sitting here this evening, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gets through preaching the seven seals and he's trying to get a message across and the fishing lines become entangled and he's getting almost frustrated and he says, "Don't don't worry about it all. Just live a clean Christian life." He says, "And the rest will take care of itself." Sometimes we try to understand every revelation. We think we don't have the Holy Ghost. I don't understand every revelation. &gt;&gt; You don't need to understand every revelation. &gt;&gt; You just need to believe in your position. And God in his time will unveil the mysteries to you. So many times we strive and we struggle. We sweat. We cry and we pray and we fast and we read the message book over and over and you say, "Lord, I give up." &gt;&gt; And then you're driving your car not thinking about anything and suddenly you got it. You got it. That revelation drops into your heart. Just live a clean Christian life. It'll all be okay. Brother Brandham would say, &gt;&gt; he says, "You can't add and take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy." He says, "Nothing gives prevailing power over the enemy as revelation of the word." It's not the emotion, &gt;&gt; it's the revelation. &gt;&gt; And if the revelation brings emotion, hallelujah anyway, but don't rely on the emotion for the revelation. It's not about how you're feeling. It's about what the word says. &gt;&gt; So don't ask me how I am. Ask me what the word says about me. Because sometimes I'm lost. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I'm saved. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I unbride myself. &gt;&gt; But there's something in the scripture &gt;&gt; that says I can never be lost. &gt;&gt; So I choose to believe what the word says about me rather than what I know about me. &gt;&gt; Cuz the word is right. I don't want to talk to no serpent. &gt;&gt; I don't want to learn that I'm naked. &gt;&gt; I don't want to learn that I'm a sinner. &gt;&gt; I don't want to learn that I've gone the wrong way. &gt;&gt; But let me believe what the word says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here &gt;&gt; the old fighters, the problem with the old fighters is they had a memory of Egypt. &gt;&gt; They had such a memory. And I need to close. I know. But let me say this. The old fighters had a memory of Egypt. The old The old fighters, they enjoyed being told what to do. They preferred the system of Egypt. They preferred They preferred go and make a city, go and make a brick, go and get some straw. for the garlic and onions of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Who likes onion and garlic? &gt;&gt; Give me a nice steak dinner. Give me some potatoes. Give me some fries. Give me pizza. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go back to onions and garlic. Give me something nice. &gt;&gt; Give me something that will sustain me through time. Oh, for the church I grew up in. And so many so many people say, "Oh, I wish I was back in the church I grew up in." What are they doing? They're looking back at the woods. They're looking backwards. Look forwards where God has placed you. Stop saying to your pastor, "We must do it like the way I grew up." Stand where God has placed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the problem was when God introduced the law to the old fighters they should have said no Lord give us grace. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon would say he says they wanted something they could do. You can read it in the scripture. He says the the greatest mistake they ever made was wanting something to do because they had a slave mentality, a slave mentality. And slaves do not possess land. Slaves just work the land. And if you go through life with a slave mentality, oh, I'm just a sinner. Oh, I'm just lost. God is saying with that slave mentality, you can never take the land. God appoints a children. &gt;&gt; They can take over the Jordan River to possess the land. But they could never possess the land because they had a slave mentality. Slaves take commands. They want something to do. They should have said, "I don't want the law. Give me the token that we had in Egypt. Give me the blood. Give me grace. I don't want something that I've got to do. I just want to believe on a finished work at Calvary." &gt;&gt; No wonder they feared the giants in Canaan. giant brother say fear lack of faith. They didn't believe who they were. They didn't believe because slaves work for a master. They work for the taskmaster of Egypt for the law. Never shake that slave mentality. in the wilderness and put their whole eternal destination experience. The land is over the river. Don't rely on an experience in the wilderness. I just received a sensation and it could never change the desires of man. in slavery free, spiritually still in bondage, pulled out of a denomination, still in bondage to a system. He's saying redemption is coming out and going in. You are not redeemed. You are not redeemed by coming out. You're redeemed when you go in. Don't rely on a wilderness experience. Cross the Red Sea and ate the mana. He saw the cloud and God says not taking the land because of a mentality problem, a slave problem. And he goes the Israelites through the wilderness with a reproach of Egypt upon them. Brother would say, "Many of you through the city, through the country, nothing but church slaves are slaves to Christianity that you should be free. I'm thankful for the message. I'm thankful for predestination that has come to call me out of church slavery. I don't want to be a slave to a system. I don't want that Christianity that when my life is falling apart that I have to run to the pastor, pastor, pastor, what do I do? I want enough of God in me that when sickness strikes the home, I don't have to ring brother Buzz and say, "Pray for me. I can pray. I can say I know my heavenly father is hearing my prayer. &gt;&gt; I have a relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm not relying on my pastor for a relationship. It's me and Christ. God has taken individuals in a rapture. I'm thankful for a message that has come to lead me out of the system. I'm thankful for a message that is changing my mentality. When there's no sensation in the new land, I'm okay. I know who I am. I know where I come from. that when I pray and it's like a black sheet comes down, I know who I am. That's what I desire. &gt;&gt; We must recognize our day and its message. &gt;&gt; You might feel a sensation. Stake your eternal destination on that. Brother would say, "One of the mysteries of the age is receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation. You never heard that in the message. That is the mystery of the age. &gt;&gt; This is what Sister Bruce was saying. I have no emotion though. Brother saying, "But you've got the Holy Ghost. I don't have the Holy Ghost." He's saying, "You've got it. I've searched your life. Prophet saw a vision of you over there. Faith in the vision, faith in the word of God. You may never feel a thing and then make a mistake. Don't unbride yourself. That's not even a word, but we're making it a word. Unbride. Don't unbride yourself. Don't write yourself off. You can have the Holy Ghost and still make a mistake. But there must be a conviction that shows what you've got. And brother Brandon would say, "Full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the token. So, so what is full obedience? Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He says it will entitle you to the token. And he says God wants to give it to you more than you want to receive. So, if you're sitting here and praying and praying for the Holy Ghost, maybe you've got it and you don't even know. Can I say there's no point in my life? &gt;&gt; I'm a message child. There's no point in my life I can put my finger on and say that time I got the Holy Ghost. But I know I met him. I know I met him. Why? Because the desires of my heart have been changing &gt;&gt; from glory to glory. Have you ever heard a preacher say that to you? &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard a preacher say, "I don't know the moment I got the Holy Ghost." But I know I got it. I'll tell you more tomorrow, but I know I got it. How do I know I got it? My life has changed. Amen. I hope that helps somebody. &gt;&gt; D my pride a little bit to say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Holy Spirit will lead you into all truth. Amen. Brother Brandon would say, "It's a mystery. The person of Christ performing in you the same works he did." &gt;&gt; He gave Canaan to the Israelites, the Holy Ghost to us. Let me go a little bit deeper, then I'm going to close. There's a real push in the message to go back to Pentecost. I don't want to go back to Pentecost. I want to go back to Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would I want to go backwards when God has eaten from me? &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon would say, &gt;&gt; he says, "But you see, each one of those ages only took taken a dip into the Holy Spirit. Sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit. Sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit. He says, "But the baptism is the Holy Spirit." That's the reason for a prophetic prophet to come down. Oh messenger to this age but the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism. What is he saying? He's saying come out of Lady Aia calling you into the bride age. I'm not talking about another eighth age. I'm talking about an age in an age. Okay, I put it like this. My flesh is in Ladyia. There's sin all around my flesh, but my spirit, my soul has been called upwards. Come up hither. Come up high. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go back to Lady A. I don't want to go back to Pentecost. I have a desire in my heart to be God tangible. The world is looking to destroy itself. Let them see life. Let them see Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says they're taking a dip. It's a dip. &gt;&gt; Where's a bottle of water? If I hold this, we say water in Australia. water. &gt;&gt; Water. &gt;&gt; So, if I have this bottle of water, &gt;&gt; if I put my finger down into this bottle and dip my finger in this bottle of water, I pull it back out after a little while, my finger dries off again. I don't want no dip of Holy Ghost. Back there, back there, they had a dip. It says now the fullness of Christ himself to a group of people back there. &gt;&gt; I want him in the inside to the outside. I don't have no come and go anointing him performing the same works that Jesus Christ did. Is that the message of the hour? A dip is a work of the Holy Spirit. A dip is a genuine work of God. It says the person of the Holy Ghost has descended. Another spot he says the gift is the gift but the giver himself has come. &gt;&gt; Why why would I want the gift when I can have the giver? Why would I settle for an emotion when I can have a revelation? Why would I settle for a Pentecostal experience when I can have that and go on? Amen. &gt;&gt; Never settle for a Pentecostal experience. That's important to the believer. Yes. &gt;&gt; On with the experience. &gt;&gt; Go on with the cloud. &gt;&gt; Never concrete down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I only speak English. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's all right. So, brother Random would say birth pains in the birth pains message he says delivered of a new birth &gt;&gt; according to Malachi 4 again under Malachi 4 again. And what's it doing? It's calling you into Jordan. Come to possess your inheritance. And Joshua is watching the old fighters dying out. Those who failed to go on with the prophet's message. But there's a generation rising up saying it doesn't matter what they say going over. No matter the hindrance, no matter the serpent's message, no matter the unbelief that hits me sometimes crossing over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me make this the last scripture. Let me make this the last scripture. Joshua chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Joshua 5 verse 2. &gt;&gt; Why don't we turn to it? Let's turn to it. Let's turn Joshua chapter 5. Joshua. &gt;&gt; We'll leave a little while for brother Michael. Joshua 5 verse 2. &gt;&gt; We've got that there. Okay. It says, "And at that time they're preparing. They're preparing to cross. &gt;&gt; Or can I say they've crossed, they're in the new land, crossed through the Jordan. They've had an experience in the Jordan." And it says Joshua 5:2 it says, "And at that time, &gt;&gt; the Lord said unto Joshua, &gt;&gt; make thee sharp knives, circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. A new birth can be a painful thing to ourselves." Paul would write in Romans, he says, "I beseech thee by the mercies of the living God your body as a living sacrifice." &gt;&gt; The thing about a living sacrifice is the fire gets a little hot. I'm getting off the sacrifice. I'm getting off the altar. &gt;&gt; But he says, "I beseech you. lay your life down as a living sacrifice. And Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. &gt;&gt; These were children that were born in Egypt, born in the wilderness. What can I say? Those born in Egypt were circumcised, which we know it's a type of the Holy Ghost. But those born in the wilderness were not circumcised. They were going to enter into the promised land circumcised. The issue here was the parents were not keeping the word in the wilderness. The parents were adapting the quotes to fit their mentality. in it became stagnant with the word able to move with the revelation. Parents wanted to keep their children in the wilderness. Our children will be pray if we go in. So many times us parents I'm a parent of three children. We use the message sometimes as a uh as a stick. We just beat our children into submission. &gt;&gt; We do. We use the message as our weapon to control things around us. The message is not your weapon. The message is Jesus Christ. Coming to lead you into the promised land. Never use the message as a list of rules of dos and don'ts. You may be have been born. You may have been born in the message. You still need to receive the Holy Ghost. You still need to be born again. Verse 9, Joshua 5:9. It says, "And the Lord said unto Joshua, &gt;&gt; this day, and I rolled away of Egypt from off of you, They left Egypt 40 plus years earlier. They walked through the wilderness with a reproach of slavery upon them through the wilderness, worrying about the problems in the past, arguing in the family, the divorce problems in the family, the sickness in the family. No matter what your slavery is here, there's something that holds us sometimes. We walk through life with a heavy burden. God is saying this day have I rolled away. So no matter what you're going through, the problems of your past with you, leave them behind. rolled away. The reproach of Egypt times the reproach is so large carried away rolled away carrying lay it at the foot of the cross time. From this time, there might be something in your life, let faith come and take control. The message of the hour, the preaching of the word that you hear, drive away that Satan that's sitting on your shoulder. You know what Jesus said on the cross? &gt;&gt; It is finished. &gt;&gt; No matter what you're carrying, it's finished. &gt;&gt; The children, the children have got a faith to believe the word for the children. &gt;&gt; As parents, never stand in the way of the children. Brother Brandon said, "Never let me stand in your way. If you've got faith, so just because they don't believe it. I believe it. I am not ashamed of the message, the nonsense in the wilderness." Nonsense. You say that here? Nonsense. the arguing the church splits. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is down the line, it is not your fault. &gt;&gt; I will not keep you out of the promised land. It is the promised land. This this day have I rolled away. Let me take the land. The kingdom of God is within you. Let me take the land. &gt;&gt; Let me take the flesh, the word that is in the inside. And then just because you've got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; doesn't mean all your personal problems are going to just fly away. I wish it did. I thought growing up in the message that if I just got the Holy Ghost, all would be okay. &gt;&gt; Yes, it will be all okay, &gt;&gt; but there's going to be problems as it is okay. Amen. Do you know what the scripture says? Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, led by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted. &gt;&gt; Jesus tempted but never fell. &gt;&gt; We might fall sometimes. &gt;&gt; Get back up again. Amen. Stand to our feet. Let me say &gt;&gt; I can't delete the memories of the past. I can't delete the memories of the past. But don't let the memories and the images and the pictures that you looked at that you should not have looked at. Don't let that control your destiny. You may never get what you did out of your mind, but the scripture says it's not in the mind of God, &gt;&gt; take faith, take faith. To he who overcomes will I give all things. &gt;&gt; Take faith. Let us take the land. &gt;&gt; Let me read this quote. He says, "If the slaves want to stay in the walled city, let them stay. For you are free. You are free. You are free." He says, "Let's go back to our inheritance. Let us go back to Eden. I don't want to go back to Pentecost. Let me go in rapture. Let me be restored back to Eden. I was just telling our brother Tasha, I'm going to close. last thing. It says when you see where he's talking about eagle written in the rock. My pastor was preaching back home &gt;&gt; and he was saying if you get brother Brandham's handwriting, his style of handwriting, you take the page of notes and you put it next to the handwriting. The exact same handwriting. Exact same handwriting. but yet written by God. &gt;&gt; And when you look at the handwriting, it's a little bit messy. &gt;&gt; My handwriting is shocking. &gt;&gt; But you look at the handwriting, it's a little messy. When Moses come down off the mountain carrying the Ten Commandments written by the finger of God, &gt;&gt; I wonder if it looked like Moses handwriting. I wonder if it looked a little bit messy. &gt;&gt; Your life is written by God. &gt;&gt; Though your life is messy sometimes. Though your life looks a little untidy sometimes. Your life is written by God. You are an epistle already written of God. And the scripture says, "You are my bride. I see a church, &gt;&gt; a glorious church, &gt;&gt; without spot without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, when God created Adam and Eve, &gt;&gt; he said it is very good. When he created created you, when he created his bride, he said, "It is a glorious church without spot wrinkle." Who are you this evening? You must recognize your worth. Recognize the worth of what is behind this. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Come along. Father Enoch, you want to come up? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us give the Lord a clap of praise for the word coming. You know, um, we sure know that the Holy Ghost is not emotion. How many can say 100% amen on that? The Holy Spirit is not emotional. But the Holy Spirit is emotional. Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Oh man, I think you have to wait for tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Can you say what I said? Amen. Is that amen? Now that's why the prophet said anything without emotion is And you know, brother Josh said, "Satan does not care about your doctrine, but only the message will bring you the revelation, of who you are. It is the revelation of your identity. Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation of your identity is what Satan is afraid of. You see the the prophet said that if they will know if the church will know who she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works, she will be an invisible army. So that's the greatest thing we should pray for, revelation. And the Bible says Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness, not the righteousness of his works, but of that revelation he had received. Praise the Lord. There's a I want us to sing that song. It's a glorious church without spo. But if you are born again, you are alive. And if if you believe what I'm saying, just say amen. You are alive with Christ. And your affections is on things above. and not on things of the world. But if you are born again of the spirit of God, you become a part of God and you are eternal with him. Then death cannot touch you. When you are born again, you are eternal. You have changed from the creature of time to a creature of eternity. You have changed from death unto life. And the prophet says, I'm talking about eternal from eternal death to eternal life. As I'm standing here, I will have eternal life. And there is no amount of of devils can convince me otherwise. You know when you have received a revelation of who you are, nothing can prove you otherwise. Nothing can talk you out of it. If you have experienced something, nothing can prove you or talk you out of that experience. And I tell you friends, the greatest experience we can get is a revelation of who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's a glorious church without a spot wrinkle. Okay. Praise God. I was just I was just about to tell you that let's just go to another service and we just close it but I'm being told that the food is ready then I think uh you know there are those who have been you know traveling and you know perhaps hungry and uh we're going to give it 30 minutes and we just come back for the last session after we have eaten and relaxed. we come back for the last session. I don't I know it would not be very long and trust me I know brother Michael I've heard him preach before not that I'm saying that you preach short but here is what I want to say friends we have come to come so we are not in a hurry are you in a hurry so let us just um you know enjoy the whole time Okay. So, you want to do &gt;&gt; All right. So, God bless you. I just hand you over to brother uh brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you appreciate our pastor? &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name. &gt;&gt; Amen.
