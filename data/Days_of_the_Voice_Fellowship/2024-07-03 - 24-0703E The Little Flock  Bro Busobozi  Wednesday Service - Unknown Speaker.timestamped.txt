[37:37] my
[37:38] name I will be in the
[37:42] mid thank you for being here with
[37:45] us we now ask that you give us a good
[37:49] atmosphere and you will also help us to
[37:51] create a good
[37:54] atmosphere for you to come
[37:57] in our midst
[37:59] tonight Grant it Lord in Jesus
[38:03] name
[38:07] amen I'd like to greet you in the name
[38:10] of our Lord
[38:13] Jesus you know uh what brings down the
[38:17] presence of God in our
[38:21] midst is not how many we
[38:24] are he not even uh what we are talking
[38:29] about it's about our
[38:36] attitude we can create an atmosphere
[38:38] around
[38:40] us that can bring down the Holy
[38:44] Spirit to minister to you or your
[38:49] sister turn to your neighbor tell them
[38:51] welcome in the
[38:52] [Music]
[38:54] house amen
[38:58] I know they're trying
[39:00] to work on the
[39:04] place and
[39:06] uh sometimes when our Sanctuary is you
[39:10] know when you know for us in the
[39:13] message when we have a sanctuary what we
[39:16] call a
[39:18] church we always look it
[39:22] out to the rest of the
[39:25] people and leave it open only for prayer
[39:27] and the word and the
[39:32] Gathering and uh until now the owner of
[39:35] the hotel cannot understand
[39:40] that because the church which was in
[39:42] here before
[39:44] us was always keeping the doors wi and
[39:48] Ja so anyone can come in and
[39:51] go so he was telling us but why do you
[39:54] keep your
[39:58] said well it's a holy place for
[40:01] us and now being that everybody has been
[40:04] coming in and try to work on the
[40:09] place of course the atmosphere cannot
[40:12] remain as our original
[40:17] atmosphere so but when we walk
[40:20] in our prayer our worship it consecrates
[40:25] the place
[40:27] it's just like if you go in an arena out
[40:30] there to preach there it's very you
[40:35] struggle but when you come inside a
[40:37] church that's dedicated for the work of
[40:41] God the atmosphere is usually
[40:44] right but you see it is us the Believers
[40:46] that set the
[40:48] atmosphere if you come tired or
[40:52] touching or having things disturbing you
[40:55] and you do not let it go
[40:58] you won't be

[44:44] flock for it is your father's good
[44:46] pleasure to give you the
[44:55] kingdom number four we get to our
[44:58] subject uh of this
[45:02] evening you notice that in the in the
[45:04] previous
[45:07] verses he spoke about a lot of
[45:10] things and he was asking us to consider
[45:15] them maybe we can be able to go through
[45:18] a few of
[45:19] them from vers
[45:22] 22 and he said unto his disciples
[45:25] therefore I say unto you you take no
[45:27] thought of for your life what ye shall
[45:30] eat neither for the body what you shall
[45:32] put
[45:40] on the life is more than meat and the
[45:44] body is more than
[45:49] rment consider the Ravens for they
[45:52] neither s nor reap which neither which
[45:55] neither have store house no burn and God
[45:59] feed them and how much more are ye
[46:01] better than the
[46:04] [Music]
[46:14] fs and which of you with taking thought
[46:18] can add to his sture one
[46:25] cubit you understand no matter what is
[46:29] going on in your personal
[46:32] life no amount of worry or
[46:37] thinking can actually add one
[46:42] cubit on your
[46:44] St so then he says if ye then be not
[46:48] able to do that thing which is least why
[46:51] take ye thought for the rest
[46:58] so if you cannot change your St by
[47:04] thinking how much more do you think that
[47:07] you can be able to accomplish the Rest
[47:08] by
[47:12] thinking by
[47:14] worrying there is nothing that you are
[47:16] going to change by worrying about
[47:22] situations there's nothing going to
[47:24] change
[47:28] and then he gave he gave us examples
[47:30] here he said consider the lies how they
[47:32] grow they toil not they spin not and yet
[47:36] I say unto you that Solomon in all his
[47:38] glory was not arrayed like one of
[47:52] those if then God so cloth the grass
[47:56] which is to today in the field and
[47:58] tomorrow is cast into the
[48:00] oven can you imagine that the Bible says
[48:02] God dresses the
[48:07] grass some grass has red
[48:12] clothes other type of grass has red
[48:15] white
[48:19] yellow God is a god of
[48:21] variety and he ured that he he made even
[48:25] grass look beautiful in the way it
[48:30] dresses but he says this
[48:32] grass today it is in the
[48:35] field tomorrow it is cast into the
[48:39] oven or like you can say in
[48:43] sopa you know for you to go and eat
[48:46] it yet God took care to dress
[48:51] it so how much more will he clothe you
[48:57] oh ye of little
[48:59] faith and then it says seek not ye that
[49:03] ye shall eat or what ye shall drink
[49:05] neither be ye of of doubtful
[49:13] [Music]
[49:16] mind God does not love
[49:20] doubters God loves people who are
[49:23] believers and he says for all these
[49:25] things do the nations of the world seek
[49:30] after what you will eat what you will
[49:32] drink what you you know this is what
[49:34] people
[49:37] think you know every human
[49:40] being every single day is thinking about
[49:45] what to
[49:46] eat what to drink what to clothe to put
[49:50] on where to
[49:51] sleep these are the things that are
[49:53] making people even not be in church on
[49:55] Wednesday evening
[50:00] this is the things that make people not
[50:01] serve
[50:03] God these are the things that actually
[50:06] make people not follow the way of
[50:10] Christianity these are the same things
[50:12] that make it feel like it is hard to be
[50:15] a
[50:18] Christian someone will ask you a
[50:21] question how do you want me to make ends
[50:24] me
[50:26] I'm in church two or three times a
[50:30] week sincerely do you have an answer to
[50:33] that
[50:34] question you almost have no answer to
[50:36] the
[50:37] question but what the Bible says do not
[50:40] have a doubtful
[50:43] mind all the people of the world or the
[50:46] Nations they seek after these
[50:51] things what they will eat what they will
[50:53] drink why they will sleep
[50:57] you know with what they will travel with
[51:00] what they will put on but for us the
[51:05] Bible says for us that you should know
[51:07] that your
[51:10] father knows that you have need of these
[51:17] things that is so comforting for
[51:19] me my father knows my father understands
[51:25] that I have need of these
[51:28] tell your neighbor my father
[51:31] knows that I have need of these
[51:34] things praise the name of the Lord so no
[51:38] matter what you
[51:39] need the father knows what you
[51:42] need therefore I am not going to stop
[51:45] worshiping
[51:47] here even because of these
[51:50] things very few people today worship Our
[51:55] Father and even so in spirit and in
[52:00] truth very few worship him that way but
[52:04] me I know my father knows what I
[52:07] need I am going to serve him I am going
[52:11] to worship him and I'm going to do it in
[52:14] spirit and in
[52:16] truth even if it means to stand
[52:21] alone hallelujah hallelujah excuse me
[52:24] for just a moment
[52:27] by the
[52:28] mar I know we have
[52:55] renovation
[53:25] e
[53:55] e
[54:25] e
[54:55] e
[55:25] e e
[56:11] is because we are more in
[56:15] number you would be
[56:17] wrong because in the whole world we have
[56:20] 8
[56:21] billion and only a little over two mil
[56:24] two billion a
[56:29] Christian the rest are
[56:31] not you have over two
[56:35] 3.2 billion
[56:40] people you know either
[56:42] Buddhists or
[56:44] Muslims and you know other
[56:46] religions and you have another 2.4 more
[56:50] than 2.4
[56:53] billion and
[56:56] there in many other you know categories
[56:59] of atheists what what
[57:03] what so there are more who are believers
[57:06] than
[57:10] Believers yeah there no no brother you
[57:13] have to I don't know is mathematics
[57:15] challenging you brother very much
[57:18] okay let me go a little bit slower here
[57:21] there are more who unbelievers than
[57:22] Believers in the world
[57:25] [Music]
[57:27] there are more nonbelievers in the
[57:31] world than
[57:33] Believers if you understand that say
[57:36] Amen now now let's look at the group
[57:40] called the
[57:42] Christians because even in the group
[57:44] called the Christians we have very many
[57:46] types of
[57:50] Christians not all professing Christians
[57:53] really are true Christians
[57:58] now did you actually know the biggest
[58:01] number of the group called Christians is
[58:03] the Roman cathol
[58:09] Catholics we have more than actually
[58:12] almost 1.5
[58:16] [Music]
[58:17] billion
[58:19] Catholics in the whole world now
[58:22] remember we have a little over
[58:25] 2 can say 2.4 billion
[58:32] Christians in the world but more than
[58:35] half of
[58:38] it is Roman
[58:40] Catholics who are they of course we all
[58:44] know Roman
[58:46] Catholicism and what they believe and
[58:48] what they stand
[58:49] for I will tell you a few things about
[58:53] the faith of the Roman Catholics
[58:56] the Roman Catholics believe in praying
[58:59] to and through the
[59:02] dead but according to the Bible that is
[59:08] spiritualism and it is not taught here
[59:12] in the
[59:14] Bible only which doctors do that kind of
[59:18] thing and other people who believe in
[59:22] spiritualism that's why our Prophet said
[59:24] that Roman Catholicism is the highest
[59:26] spiritualism that there
[59:31] is right here where we live we have a
[59:36] shrine one of the biggest shrines in the
[59:39] whole
[59:41] world here
[59:43] in I don't know is said four pops have
[59:46] been
[59:47] here and you know whenever they come all
[59:51] these people they walk from all over the
[59:52] country and all over the region
[59:56] they come by tens of
[59:58] thousands and and they come here every
[1:00:01] once a
[1:00:02] year and and you know in this place some
[1:00:05] of you don't know the things that take
[1:00:07] place there it's not only the
[1:00:10] prayers where the Pres that go and you
[1:00:12] know no there are other things that
[1:00:15] happen you see because they believe that
[1:00:17] these people were killed
[1:00:19] there because of their religion and let
[1:00:23] me put this correct they didn't they
[1:00:25] were not
[1:00:26] killed because of Christ but they were
[1:00:30] killed because of their
[1:00:32] religion so now these are different from
[1:00:34] the matters the Bible speaks of in the
[1:00:36] Book of
[1:00:39] Revelation they are not matters of
[1:00:42] Christ matters of their
[1:00:45] religion all right and we can if you
[1:00:47] want the history you can of course go
[1:00:48] and study about the matters of
[1:00:53] Nam you know how they were killed
[1:00:58] and so they died because of their
[1:01:00] religion and so uh now
[1:01:04] Vatican I don't know is it called
[1:01:05] canonizing or canonized them and they
[1:01:09] made them
[1:01:12] saints so now they are Saints so now
[1:01:16] that is why people come from all over
[1:01:17] the
[1:01:18] world and they come at this Shrine it is
[1:01:21] called a
[1:01:23] shrine why because you see a shrine is a
[1:01:27] place where people go to pray through
[1:01:33] mediums or to pray to Media to pray to a
[1:01:39] person you know a holy
[1:01:42] Place actually I see the definition here
[1:01:44] says a
[1:01:47] place regarded as holy because of its
[1:01:50] associations with the divinity
[1:01:56] or a sacred
[1:01:59] person or a
[1:02:06] relic marked by a building or other
[1:02:13] construction and so here they believe
[1:02:15] these
[1:02:16] people killed there and they have
[1:02:20] erected
[1:02:22] statutes and they they they have
[1:02:24] different shrines
[1:02:27] and they have different pawns tops
[1:02:30] whatever where people go and and and and
[1:02:33] and take this
[1:02:34] water and they consider it to be holy
[1:02:38] water I think do they buy do they sell
[1:02:41] it no okay so it is considered to be
[1:02:44] holy
[1:02:45] water so people will come with
[1:02:48] J from as far
[1:02:52] as from all the way all across
[1:02:57] and they come and that
[1:03:00] water to to take it throughout the year
[1:03:03] another year they will come back
[1:03:06] again you see that is that is
[1:03:11] spiritualism they believe you know you
[1:03:13] can go to the
[1:03:14] toms and pray through somebody who
[1:03:18] die as long as they were a priest or
[1:03:21] somebody who is considered to be
[1:03:24] holy just giving you
[1:03:27] facts these are not lies it is
[1:03:30] facts and also they they you know have a
[1:03:36] woman who they believe that she's a holy
[1:03:40] woman um Mary they believe that she's a
[1:03:43] mother of
[1:03:45] God their God has a
[1:03:49] mother but our God the god of the Bible
[1:03:53] does not have a mother
[1:03:56] but their God has a mother and their
[1:03:59] mother is the most
[1:04:01] holy whereby they cannot actually dare
[1:04:04] approach
[1:04:07] God but they will have to approach God
[1:04:10] through the mother
[1:04:13] of and then they will ask the mother of
[1:04:16] God to pray for them on on their
[1:04:23] behalf and and so and this is the
[1:04:26] biggest Christian religion in the whole
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:30] world the word Catholic means the
[1:04:32] universal
[1:04:35] church so Orthodox is very close to the
[1:04:38] same same
[1:04:41] teachings so you see that they believe
[1:04:44] that these are the
[1:04:46] truth but most most of them their major
[1:04:50] truth are not written or are not
[1:04:52] Vindicated by the Bible
[1:04:57] and you see also the Orthodox same
[1:05:00] thing over 300 million
[1:05:03] people and when you United with the
[1:05:06] Roman Catholics you have almost um uh
[1:05:09] something close to 1.7
[1:05:17] billion and you have the the Anglican
[1:05:19] which is about 85
[1:05:22] million from all over the world thean
[1:05:25] community
[1:05:26] and so you are left now with many other
[1:05:30] groups mostly Protestant Pentecostal
[1:05:35] groups are the
[1:05:37] minority but even among those
[1:05:39] minorities you find that they believe
[1:05:41] things which are not
[1:05:43] here you find that they believe in the
[1:05:46] Trinity just like their mother Church
[1:05:48] the Catholic
[1:05:49] Church you find that they they believe
[1:05:51] in women
[1:05:53] preachers things are against the
[1:05:55] scriptures
[1:05:56] and so you go on scaling scaling scaling
[1:05:59] scaling down down down down until you
[1:06:02] reach to a group called The Apostolic
[1:06:06] church now this is one of the very last
[1:06:09] groups to be
[1:06:12] formed since Thea Street
[1:06:17] Revival and to be a
[1:06:19] denomination and it's one of the biggest
[1:06:22] uh denominations really
[1:06:26] among the
[1:06:28] Pentecostal but even
[1:06:30] they I can say that they closest to the
[1:06:35] scriptures than all the other
[1:06:39] groups but when you if you you know and
[1:06:42] believe this
[1:06:44] message and you put the light the
[1:06:47] glasses of this
[1:06:49] message and you look at what they
[1:06:51] teach you realize that many of them
[1:06:55] also gone
[1:06:57] astray so what am I trying to
[1:07:00] say that he said that when the son of
[1:07:03] man
[1:07:04] comes will he find faith on the
[1:07:08] earth those who are going in the
[1:07:11] Rapture are going to be the
[1:07:14] minority they going to be the Chosen
[1:07:17] Few they going to really be very few
[1:07:28] now I have a few things I want to read
[1:07:31] for you
[1:07:32] here in the message thean Church
[1:07:36] age he says all through the Dark
[1:07:40] Ages he's talking about the Catholic
[1:07:43] Church she has
[1:07:46] dominated for over 900
[1:07:48] years she planted and
[1:07:53] destroyed she killed the Arts
[1:07:56] destroyed the Sciences sence produced
[1:07:59] nothing but death until the light of the
[1:08:01] truth was almost entirely gone and only
[1:08:03] the beest S silver of light
[1:08:14] remained the be life splint of light
[1:08:18] Remain the oil and the wine had almost
[1:08:22] ceased to flow
[1:08:26] but though she
[1:08:28] dominated all the world
[1:08:30] kingdoms and demanded all men to find
[1:08:33] their citizenship in
[1:08:38] her there was a little group who belong
[1:08:41] to God and their citizenship was in
[1:08:46] heaven and them she could not
[1:08:50] destroy God kept his little
[1:08:54] flock they could not be
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:08:57] destroyed this Church of Rome was as
[1:09:00] hien and wicked as Queen
[1:09:06] aaria who tried to destroy all the Royal
[1:09:08] seed and
[1:09:10] almost
[1:09:17] succeeded but God preserved
[1:09:20] one and of him there came more of the
[1:09:24] faithful
[1:09:27] so God preserved a little
[1:09:30] FL in that long dark
[1:09:35] night and of their truth there finally
[1:09:38] arose a
[1:09:42] Luther now I'm trying to show you
[1:09:44] something here that we have seven Church
[1:09:47] ages but in every age you know God was
[1:09:52] walking and preserving for himself a
[1:09:55] little
[1:09:58] flock I I want you to open your
[1:10:00] spiritual
[1:10:01] mind don't sleep
[1:10:04] spiritually I want you to understand we
[1:10:07] are not here to form another
[1:10:10] church or another
[1:10:13] denomination we are actually not
[1:10:14] following any
[1:10:16] man we are not members of any
[1:10:20] denomination we are supposed to actually
[1:10:24] be part of the little flock in these
[1:10:27] last
[1:10:30] days because in every age there has been
[1:10:34] a little flock that was
[1:10:38] left for example in the first
[1:10:42] age called
[1:10:44] Ephesus there was those
[1:10:46] few that held on to the
[1:10:49] word then come come comes man there was
[1:10:52] those few that held on to the word
[1:10:55] and in every age God was sending a
[1:10:59] messenger but now the ones who held on
[1:11:01] to the
[1:11:03] world we are not the
[1:11:05] majority they were the
[1:11:09] minority in every age you see there was
[1:11:13] that
[1:11:14] Minority now listen when we talk about
[1:11:17] the bride and say the
[1:11:19] bride we are not referring to our
[1:11:21] churches in the end time
[1:11:25] we are only a little piece of the
[1:11:29] Bride the bride has been Gathering since
[1:11:32] the very first church
[1:11:36] age and all the members of the Bride are
[1:11:39] sleeping
[1:11:41] now apart from us who are alive when
[1:11:45] Paul wrote first
[1:11:48] Thessalonians chapter four he said they
[1:11:52] they will rise first
[1:11:55] and we who are alive and remain shall be
[1:11:57] CAU up be
[1:11:59] Chang so Paul was also at that time
[1:12:02] believing that he will be
[1:12:05] alive but Paul is not alive to
[1:12:09] see the last age you and I are the ones
[1:12:14] who are alive to see the last
[1:12:17] age called
[1:12:19] Lord in this last age God does his final
[1:12:23] work
[1:12:26] Gathering his last flock
[1:12:29] FL amen and and we are the Omega
[1:12:32] bride but the first church
[1:12:34] age had the the uh the um Alpha
[1:12:40] Bri the beginning so now all of them who
[1:12:44] died in
[1:12:46] Christ when the trumpet of God
[1:12:49] sound they will all rise up we shall
[1:12:53] actually literally see them
[1:12:57] physically do you know that Jesus is
[1:12:59] coming back
[1:13:00] physically do you know we shall see him
[1:13:04] with our eyes the Bible says we don't
[1:13:06] know how we shall
[1:13:08] be but we know we shall be like him when
[1:13:10] he
[1:13:12] comes so we shall have the same body
[1:13:15] like amen we shall see him he will see
[1:13:19] us and we shall go and be with him in
[1:13:21] heaven so but the dead in Christ will be
[1:13:25] the very first one to rise
[1:13:27] up and then we which are alive and
[1:13:30] remain so we are also believing we are
[1:13:32] the ones going to be
[1:13:34] alive because we are in the last
[1:13:37] age and then we shall be
[1:13:40] changed and then we will meet with
[1:13:42] them and then together we meet Jesus
[1:13:46] Christ in so if you have any loved
[1:13:49] one that died before and he died
[1:13:53] believing you will see him first before
[1:13:56] you see
[1:13:58] Christ praise the name of the Lord so
[1:14:01] now he says in there was that little
[1:14:04] FL there has always the Church of Jesus
[1:14:07] has always been the little
[1:14:10] flock it has never been the mega
[1:14:13] church it will never be the mega church
[1:14:17] it will always be the little
[1:14:20] FL always will be
[1:14:22] the now does it mean that we should not
[1:14:24] have big
[1:14:26] churches yes of course we can have big
[1:14:30] churches but I can tell you this we can
[1:14:33] never have the biggest
[1:14:35] church Never As a matter of fact the
[1:14:39] number of
[1:14:42] unbelievers even in message
[1:14:45] churches is
[1:14:47] bigger in bigger
[1:14:51] churches our Prophet told us there are
[1:14:53] three kinds of believers
[1:14:58] in every
[1:14:59] Church including
[1:15:03] ours three kinds of
[1:15:06] Believers we have the real genuine
[1:15:10] believers who take God at his
[1:15:12] word whatever the word says they say
[1:15:15] Amen they believe it they do it they
[1:15:17] follow
[1:15:19] it they never debate with it as long as
[1:15:23] the word says it they say Amen to that
[1:15:26] word they follow that word their life
[1:15:30] changes every day it
[1:15:32] changes follow that word now those are
[1:15:35] the Believers do I have some
[1:15:38] tonight those are the Believers I
[1:15:41] believe I am one of them but we have
[1:15:44] another group those are the mega
[1:15:49] believers they will they will believe
[1:15:51] like the
[1:15:53] Believers but they don't really when
[1:15:55] they
[1:15:56] believe because they do things when you
[1:15:59] see them when you don't see them they do
[1:16:00] other
[1:16:03] things when when you see them they say
[1:16:05] God bless
[1:16:06] you when they go in in the corner they
[1:16:08] do something completely different and
[1:16:11] opposite they are
[1:16:13] hypocrites they are not
[1:16:15] genuine you can never know even when you
[1:16:18] hear son has done
[1:16:20] something that brother
[1:16:23] s you can even say no that one is a real
[1:16:28] brother but he was a me believer he was
[1:16:31] hiding himself within among the
[1:16:34] Believers but he was not
[1:16:38] genuine I hope we don't have
[1:16:40] any maybe today they have not
[1:16:43] come maybe they will come on Sunday but
[1:16:46] we have them in the church every
[1:16:49] Fellowship has
[1:16:50] them and we have another
[1:16:53] category Nel
[1:16:56] they will be in every
[1:16:59] Fellowship go and study it the problem
[1:17:02] you don't want to listen to the
[1:17:04] message brother bam has preached it
[1:17:07] three kinds of
[1:17:09] Believers go and listen to
[1:17:12] it that the
[1:17:15] nonbelievers those ones they will never
[1:17:16] agree with
[1:17:18] anything they can't hide their
[1:17:20] colors he's not
[1:17:22] living but he's always not agre with
[1:17:27] anything he can even tell you that one I
[1:17:30] don't agree with
[1:17:32] it may I have another
[1:17:34] opinion but is also in the
[1:17:38] fellowship that category will always be
[1:17:42] there even in the Church of Jesus they
[1:17:45] were there in in the Church of Moses
[1:17:48] they were there in the Church of brother
[1:17:50] bam they were there and even in our
[1:17:52] church today in every Fellowship
[1:17:56] they are
[1:17:57] there but I thank God that we have ears
[1:18:00] to hear eyes to see and heart to believe
[1:18:06] we are real
[1:18:07] Believers now the Believers are the ones
[1:18:09] I'm speaking
[1:18:10] of there will always be the little flock
[1:18:14] there will always be the
[1:18:16] minority the Bible would say in the Book
[1:18:18] of Matthew
[1:18:20] 73 enter ye in at the Straight
[1:18:23] Gate for wi is is the gate and Broad is
[1:18:27] the is the way that leadth to
[1:18:30] destruction and many there be which go
[1:18:33] in their
[1:18:34] R because straight is the gate and
[1:18:39] narrow is the
[1:18:40] way which leadth unto life and few there
[1:18:44] be that find
[1:18:45] it may God help you to find that little
[1:18:50] way straight is the gate wide is the
[1:18:53] gate straight is the gate wide is the
[1:18:57] gate broad is the
[1:18:59] way that leads to the
[1:19:02] destruction which means the
[1:19:05] majority will always go the wrong
[1:19:08] route but the minority will always
[1:19:11] follow the right
[1:19:13] thing are you hearing me ask your
[1:19:16] neighbor are you
[1:19:20] hearing the true genuine
[1:19:23] Believers Never never do something
[1:19:25] because the majority do
[1:19:29] it you will never follow something
[1:19:31] because the majority are
[1:19:34] following they will set their own
[1:19:39] Trend there are people in this
[1:19:41] world that set
[1:19:44] Trends and others follow
[1:19:46] them are you following me social
[1:19:50] media people are there doing a lot of
[1:19:53] things and the more you keep watching it
[1:19:57] the more you want to follow what they
[1:19:59] doing but the true genuine
[1:20:01] believer will not follow social
[1:20:05] media but we will follow the word in
[1:20:09] everything about their life in any
[1:20:13] aspect of their life in every area of
[1:20:18] their life be it how to manage a
[1:20:21] home you know how to live your life
[1:20:25] how to behave at
[1:20:27] work I mean
[1:20:29] everything you will let the word of God
[1:20:32] saturate you in every area of your
[1:20:36] life you will be a believer in the
[1:20:39] church you be a believer out of church
[1:20:43] you'll be a believer at work you be a
[1:20:45] believer at school you'll be a believer
[1:20:48] in everything you are
[1:20:50] doing and amen you are not a Believer
[1:20:52] only here and out there you are
[1:20:54] something
[1:20:56] else we have people who have a spirit or
[1:21:00] the spirit of a dark on
[1:21:03] them you know how a dark
[1:21:06] behaves a duck will sure come in the
[1:21:10] rain and will allow the rain to rain
[1:21:13] down on
[1:21:16] it when you look at it you'll feel sorry
[1:21:19] for it see this
[1:21:22] dark it is completely
[1:21:26] wet but after it finishes to
[1:21:30] rain it just does like
[1:21:34] this it becomes
[1:21:37] dry the way it was
[1:21:40] before there are people who come in the
[1:21:43] church sometimes they even enjoy the
[1:21:46] word from today I'm
[1:21:48] changing as soon as they go out there
[1:21:52] peer pressure begins
[1:21:54] so and so
[1:21:56] comes and whatever they had they just
[1:22:01] shake it off it doesn't make sense
[1:22:04] anymore what happened what happened to
[1:22:07] them they never let the word of God come
[1:22:10] into their
[1:22:12] heart I am hoping that there is no one
[1:22:14] here with a spirit of a
[1:22:20] dark we hear the word we believe the
[1:22:23] word and we are allowing the word to
[1:22:25] change
[1:22:29] us brother sister my brother when you
[1:22:33] listen to the word open up your
[1:22:37] heart allow the word to come into your
[1:22:40] heart that it will cover that it will go
[1:22:46] deep go deep into your heart that it
[1:22:50] will change you that it will give you a
[1:22:53] new life some when they hear the
[1:22:55] word they they partition it in several
[1:22:58] other
[1:22:59] places you receive God in some part of
[1:23:04] your but in another area you
[1:23:07] refuse when I believed this message I
[1:23:10] was ready to give my
[1:23:13] all every part of
[1:23:15] me let it let the Holy Spirit by the
[1:23:18] word of God
[1:23:25] and you see you cannot receive the word
[1:23:28] when you are under the spirit of
[1:23:34] denomination in The Invisible Union of
[1:23:36] the
[1:23:37] Bride it says remember straight is the
[1:23:41] gate and narrow is the
[1:23:44] way and few there and few but sorry and
[1:23:48] but few there will be that will find
[1:23:52] it don't go in that with that crowd
[1:23:55] that's moving on
[1:23:58] Yonder thatan Church
[1:24:01] age it could jump up and
[1:24:04] down it could dance under
[1:24:10] music didn't say it was ice
[1:24:14] cold it said it was
[1:24:18] lukewarm that's the
[1:24:20] Pentecostal and don't know that it's
[1:24:23] miserable
[1:24:26] they don't know it they're miserable
[1:24:27] they're wretched they're
[1:24:31] blind you find these kind of
[1:24:35] denominations you find young people like
[1:24:37] most of
[1:24:38] you and they go in the church and they
[1:24:42] call it
[1:24:44] praise you know how many have seen
[1:24:47] that praise young people like Sam they
[1:24:51] come up dress them in pajamas
[1:24:56] very
[1:24:57] tight
[1:24:59] Solomon IRAs and others no they don't
[1:25:02] pick the ones they pick the the Slender
[1:25:06] ones tell them come and they they they
[1:25:10] tighten
[1:25:12] themselves you can literally see every
[1:25:14] part of their
[1:25:15] body and then they someone comes there
[1:25:19] is is is not a praise
[1:25:21] leader and he's wearing this short
[1:25:26] sleeve you see they are physically
[1:25:30] fit they ready to praise
[1:25:33] God and they have this heart a man
[1:25:37] imagine men are wearing hearts in the
[1:25:41] church let me tell you those are not
[1:25:44] churches and that's not praise to our
[1:25:47] God don't be deceived don't be deceived
[1:25:51] that those are not churches
[1:25:54] is not praise to the God I
[1:25:57] know that's another Jesus but the Jesus
[1:26:01] we
[1:26:02] know canot accept such
[1:26:06] price and then this man
[1:26:08] begins you know with all the younger
[1:26:11] ladies same thing they Tien
[1:26:14] themselves and then now they stand in
[1:26:16] such a
[1:26:17] way and the whole crowd is
[1:26:20] waiting you don't see anyone
[1:26:22] dozing they all waiting to
[1:26:25] see yeah it's time for praise brother
[1:26:29] lifts up the
[1:26:30] praise the
[1:26:32] musicians they have all these
[1:26:35] dreadlocks now those would be the shames
[1:26:37] and others and they have the
[1:26:42] dreadlocks I'm imagining you brothers
[1:26:44] having
[1:26:47] dreadlocks and you're coming on the
[1:26:49] piano they can't even sit
[1:26:52] because they stand
[1:26:55] begin
[1:26:57] shaking and then they begin playing and
[1:27:00] people when this one is
[1:27:02] singing which songs do they sing
[1:27:05] brother yeah you know how do they sing
[1:27:10] it this yeah
[1:27:17] singing so the song is saying that my
[1:27:20] Miracle is here
[1:27:22] today and as they're doing
[1:27:25] they begin jumping they all in order in
[1:27:28] one form they throw their legs they
[1:27:32] thrown the light they thrown
[1:27:35] the they throw their hands they throw
[1:27:38] their stomach they they
[1:27:41] throw they shake their
[1:27:43] head all in the same
[1:27:45] direction and then we yeah we are
[1:27:48] praising
[1:27:49] God come on and your hands let us praise
[1:27:54] the Lord and
[1:27:56] they it is the highest deception that
[1:27:59] there
[1:28:01] is that is
[1:28:04] entertainment it is not
[1:28:07] worship it is not
[1:28:10] worship and let me tell you God has
[1:28:12] delivered us from
[1:28:15] such God has delivered us from such he
[1:28:19] say they they did not say they were ice
[1:28:23] cold the Bible says they were
[1:28:26] lukewarm he say they
[1:28:28] Pentecostal they don't know that they're
[1:28:31] miserable red and
[1:28:33] blind but the question is blind to
[1:28:37] what they are blind to the
[1:28:40] word to the manifestation of the
[1:28:44] word praise the name of the Lord because
[1:28:47] it never come through their
[1:28:50] organizations listen the word of God
[1:28:52] cannot come through an organiz
[1:28:57] the word of God Amen comes through the
[1:28:59] message of the
[1:29:02] hour they cannot receive
[1:29:04] it Matthew 10 ver
[1:29:07] 29 it says and not two Sparrow sold for
[1:29:10] a fa thing and one of them shall not
[1:29:13] fall on the ground without your
[1:29:17] father 109
[1:29:30] but the very hairs of your head are all
[1:29:36] numbered he says fear ye not
[1:29:39] there ye are more of value than many
[1:29:45] sparrows praise the name of the Lord
[1:29:48] when we talk about the L flock
[1:29:50] church it's a church that is very
[1:29:53] valuable
[1:29:56] is a church that is very special to
[1:29:59] God well there is another one which is
[1:30:01] not a little flock
[1:30:03] church but this one I'm talking about is
[1:30:06] a little flock
[1:30:08] Church it has always been the
[1:30:11] minority they have always held the
[1:30:13] minority
[1:30:15] views this Bible has always been
[1:30:17] believed on by the
[1:30:20] minority many claim to believe it but
[1:30:23] very really believe it but the church
[1:30:26] that is going in the
[1:30:27] Rapture is a little flock
[1:30:31] church and I believe I'm one of
[1:30:35] them praise the name of the Lord and and
[1:30:39] before you finish I'll read a certain
[1:30:41] long long quote really
[1:30:44] and so listen it says the hour is
[1:30:48] come and I titled it he said the how is
[1:30:51] come make your stand
[1:30:55] listen the time came for
[1:30:58] sadra M and to show their
[1:31:02] colors their faith in
[1:31:05] God did you know the time comes for each
[1:31:08] and every one of
[1:31:11] us to show their true
[1:31:15] colors to show their faith in
[1:31:18] God lack of faith
[1:31:21] in s m
[1:31:25] their time had
[1:31:27] come to show their true
[1:31:30] colors are they real
[1:31:33] Believers are they
[1:31:35] nonbelievers are they make
[1:31:39] Believers so they turned their back to
[1:31:41] the
[1:31:43] image they said our God is able to
[1:31:46] Deliver Us from this Fey
[1:31:51] fness but nevertheless
[1:31:54] will not bow down to any other images
[1:31:57] any of
[1:31:58] images there it was it was
[1:32:02] time the season was there so then the
[1:32:06] time came that when he was going to
[1:32:08] throw them into the Fey
[1:32:12] f to burn that religion out of
[1:32:17] them that's what the devil is trying to
[1:32:19] do even in our generation
[1:32:24] to burn our religion out of
[1:32:27] us but let me tell you what we have
[1:32:30] received the devil cannot burn it out of
[1:32:35] us because what we have received is more
[1:32:38] than
[1:32:40] Creeds what we have receiv you may say
[1:32:42] well you are
[1:32:43] few you are few even all over the world
[1:32:46] you are few I will even write out I tell
[1:32:49] you
[1:32:50] here recently actually the pastor that
[1:32:53] was a pastor of the biggest church in
[1:32:54] the message died
[1:32:58] recently he called brother baruti from
[1:33:02] Congo you know he had I don't not know
[1:33:05] the number but really tens of
[1:33:08] thousands and you find very few churches
[1:33:11] like
[1:33:12] those and I've found one maybe in
[1:33:14] Nigeria also and a few also others
[1:33:18] in I don't know Zimbabwe maybe I don't
[1:33:20] know whether maybe some some thousands
[1:33:24] well but all over the world you will
[1:33:27] find the message belie believing
[1:33:31] churches will be the
[1:33:35] minority we are not
[1:33:36] known we don't seek to be known
[1:33:41] also because our
[1:33:44] goal is not our
[1:33:46] goal is not to
[1:33:49] possess here in the
[1:33:51] world to possess places
[1:33:54] to possess you know
[1:33:57] spes when you go over in the Pentecostal
[1:34:00] world that is their
[1:34:02] goal to possess
[1:34:04] spes one who has the biggest TV
[1:34:09] show who has the biggest listen
[1:34:13] listenership who has the biggest
[1:34:15] following who has the biggest church and
[1:34:19] you know they feel they have big
[1:34:21] accomplishments
[1:34:24] when they have a 20,000
[1:34:28] SE and so you see p will start
[1:34:31] today and in the
[1:34:34] next five
[1:34:36] years they have a thousand
[1:34:41] people it's very easy just tell them
[1:34:44] what they need to
[1:34:46] hear don't judge
[1:34:48] them don't tell don't talk against what
[1:34:51] they
[1:34:52] doing you know try to twist and tune the
[1:34:56] word in such a
[1:34:58] way that it will make them feel
[1:35:01] comfortable that even a sinner will come
[1:35:03] in the church and he will feel that this
[1:35:06] is surely my
[1:35:08] church when I went to church I felt so
[1:35:11] good I never felt
[1:35:13] judged I felt so
[1:35:16] comfortable and so this will be my
[1:35:18] church and another will come another
[1:35:20] come another come but you see this
[1:35:23] message is
[1:35:24] different why because our purpose is not
[1:35:28] to occupy
[1:35:30] space the purpose of this message is not
[1:35:34] even to start another
[1:35:36] denomination it is not to seek
[1:35:40] recognition you know and by the way it's
[1:35:42] not only us it is even those who were
[1:35:45] here before
[1:35:47] us all the other believers in the
[1:35:49] generations before
[1:35:51] us they did not seek
[1:35:54] recognition they did not seek space they
[1:35:57] did not seek you know big you know
[1:36:01] attendance but they had one one one
[1:36:03] thing in
[1:36:04] common they were all having a passion in
[1:36:07] them they were having a Passion Of
[1:36:10] Truth they were having a Passion of
[1:36:14] afterlife they were having a Passion of
[1:36:17] seeking God and finding
[1:36:19] God and being changed and overcoming the
[1:36:22] world
[1:36:26] you know they would read scriptures like
[1:36:27] we are the salt of the
[1:36:29] earth we are the light of the world they
[1:36:32] did not come here to make people
[1:36:34] comfortable in the
[1:36:36] world but whatever they
[1:36:39] preached was to make people feel
[1:36:41] uncomfortable in the
[1:36:44] world so that they can seek for another
[1:36:49] country whose Builder and maker is God
[1:36:55] and I believe that to every um one who
[1:36:58] claims to
[1:37:00] believe really that how
[1:37:03] comes that
[1:37:05] comes when you have to show your true
[1:37:11] color now you know that how never comes
[1:37:14] until you have
[1:37:18] opposition until you face problems in
[1:37:21] your
[1:37:22] life until you faced with with
[1:37:27] difficulties are you are you following
[1:37:29] me now and we look at Several of them
[1:37:32] here now that's what the devil tries to
[1:37:35] do all the
[1:37:36] time is to bur you on some to burn you
[1:37:39] up on
[1:37:41] something to make you Seeker when you
[1:37:44] are prayed
[1:37:48] for to make you think you've lost your
[1:37:51] experience with God
[1:37:56] but he's lying to
[1:37:58] you the time comes when you have to
[1:38:01] stand on God's
[1:38:03] word and and here is what I love most he
[1:38:06] said stand
[1:38:10] alone many times when I go on on on
[1:38:14] missionary
[1:38:16] Journeys preach to a a group of people
[1:38:20] maybe five or 10 people and you are
[1:38:24] introducing the message to
[1:38:25] them uh they would see everything is the
[1:38:29] truth but I've
[1:38:31] noticed and I give some of you who like
[1:38:35] evangelism a
[1:38:37] tactic on how to introduce the message
[1:38:40] to a new
[1:38:43] person you don't U meet a
[1:38:47] group because whenever you meet a
[1:38:51] group it's very hard to find one
[1:38:56] why people always are fear fearful to
[1:38:59] stand
[1:39:02] alone they want to stand as a
[1:39:04] group and so usually what I
[1:39:07] do I sit with when I I sit with a group
[1:39:12] talk with them and then I will Design
[1:39:14] who has the love of God in their
[1:39:20] heart and then appoint them at later
[1:39:26] dat and then we meet I meet with
[1:39:29] them show them the scriptures
[1:39:32] show then they will make their
[1:39:34] stand where they believe and many have
[1:39:36] believed that
[1:39:38] way see we were in what's the name of
[1:39:41] the place Brother Martin uh the
[1:39:46] north yeah L we were in
[1:39:49] L and you know we visiting a family from
[1:39:53] nor way you know took us to our family
[1:39:56] and preached there several people Tred
[1:39:59] from many
[1:40:00] places now after they received the word
[1:40:03] very
[1:40:04] well but when it came to now the time of
[1:40:08] decision that's where you you had to see
[1:40:10] now people looking
[1:40:12] down and they looking at one another are
[1:40:16] you
[1:40:18] accepting and a few very few a little
[1:40:23] group
[1:40:25] accepted and I'm preaching on the little
[1:40:29] flock the the little flock will always
[1:40:32] stand
[1:40:34] alone the time comes when you have to
[1:40:36] stand on God's word stand
[1:40:40] alone but when that time
[1:40:43] comes stand there stand alone stand
[1:40:47] there there's got to be a time when
[1:40:49] you've got to separate yourself
[1:40:54] between your
[1:40:55] feelings and your
[1:40:59] faith and he says that's the time
[1:41:02] tonight praise the name of the Lord no
[1:41:04] matter what you feel regardless of your
[1:41:07] feelings that time comes where you have
[1:41:09] to separate
[1:41:11] yourself from your feelings and your
[1:41:14] faith the time comes that when this
[1:41:17] Hebrew children had to seal their
[1:41:19] testimony by a fey furnace
[1:41:26] I can see them that
[1:41:28] morning let's look
[1:41:31] immediately I can see them that morning
[1:41:33] they would come a great time in
[1:41:38] Babylon the king said now
[1:41:41] look we've got some Fanatics down
[1:41:45] here and they causing us a little
[1:41:48] trouble with their
[1:41:51] religion Hallelujah amen amen glory to
[1:41:55] God I like to be called a
[1:41:58] fanatic I'd rather be called a fanatic
[1:42:00] for
[1:42:01] Jesus rather be called a fanatical
[1:42:04] believer and I would rather be hated by
[1:42:07] the
[1:42:08] world for what I stand for for what I
[1:42:12] believe amen they were called
[1:42:15] Fanatics amen they were called
[1:42:18] outcasts and they say they were bringing
[1:42:20] trouble with their religion
[1:42:26] where it comes to a
[1:42:28] place where it comes to a place and you
[1:42:31] are among a
[1:42:34] people and those people don't actually
[1:42:37] have a problem with
[1:42:40] you the things they do you do the things
[1:42:43] they love you love there's a problem
[1:42:46] with your
[1:42:47] religion your religion is not
[1:42:49] salty you're not attracting people to
[1:42:52] what you believe
[1:42:54] but you are attracting people actually
[1:42:56] people are actually really influencing
[1:42:58] you over to their
[1:43:01] side I hope that each of us can have a a
[1:43:04] true
[1:43:07] religion where it will cause trouble in
[1:43:09] your
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:11] vicinity I remember when I I used to be
[1:43:14] in
[1:43:15] school I was called all sorts of
[1:43:18] things because I never I never Shi away
[1:43:23] when it came to the
[1:43:25] word I always held the word of God with
[1:43:27] high
[1:43:29] regard matter of fact I've told young
[1:43:33] people how to
[1:43:35] overcome in school and this is what I
[1:43:38] did you see time comes this is for the
[1:43:42] young people that you would see you know
[1:43:45] someone that you attracted
[1:43:51] to I don't know whether they understand
[1:43:53] understand
[1:43:56] that yes brother a
[1:44:00] girl or some these days girls actually
[1:44:03] see better than
[1:44:06] boys a boy
[1:44:10] sister when I came in those moments my
[1:44:13] weak moments by this is what I would
[1:44:17] do I would call
[1:44:20] them and I tell them have something I
[1:44:23] want to share
[1:44:25] with and I would and I would open of
[1:44:27] course I would be
[1:44:28] nervous but I would open the
[1:44:31] scriptures and begin
[1:44:33] teaching on
[1:44:38] godhead women
[1:44:40] preachers the
[1:44:42] Rapture
[1:44:45] Holiness you know and all these
[1:44:47] things and by the time I'm done and I
[1:44:50] would even talk about because of course
[1:44:52] if I was talking to a god
[1:44:55] I've talked about
[1:44:57] trousers
[1:44:59] Holiness you know and I've talked about
[1:45:01] also um you know many of the things we
[1:45:03] believe
[1:45:05] in now she's a woman many times she
[1:45:08] would they would reject
[1:45:10] it and reject it with
[1:45:13] passion and whenever they did that I
[1:45:16] would reject their character with
[1:45:20] passion that way there is no way I could
[1:45:22] fall for someone I rejected with
[1:45:28] passion and if they would
[1:45:30] believe well then I would be their
[1:45:33] pastor and how can I as their
[1:45:37] Pastor be found in a scenario that is
[1:45:39] not
[1:45:40] good so then I went through
[1:45:43] school without one
[1:45:47] episode of living
[1:45:50] immoral why not because I was you know
[1:45:53] you know super
[1:45:54] powerful but because I was ready to
[1:45:57] stand for the word in every moment I
[1:46:03] got and so Brethren if you stand for the
[1:46:06] word some of you you have
[1:46:08] friends they don't actually even know
[1:46:10] what you
[1:46:12] believe shame on you how can you have a
[1:46:17] friend that you spend one two three four
[1:46:19] days
[1:46:21] with and they don't know what you
[1:46:24] believe they don't know your
[1:46:26] stand they don't even know about the
[1:46:29] Rapture those are the same
[1:46:32] friends that you will be with in the
[1:46:37] tribulation and you will know what is
[1:46:39] going
[1:46:40] on and they won't and you'll be the one
[1:46:43] to tell them actually I know what is
[1:46:46] happening and he will tell them they
[1:46:48] will tell you what is happening so we
[1:46:50] are actually in the tribulation
[1:46:54] let me tell you what is coming next and
[1:46:56] they'll begin calling you a prophet but
[1:46:59] you'll be a prophet of
[1:47:00] Doom and they will judge you they say
[1:47:04] why did you not tell
[1:47:05] us said but you know you will have
[1:47:08] nothing to
[1:47:09] say but now you have an
[1:47:12] opportunity if you're truly convinced
[1:47:14] about this
[1:47:16] truth number one you are not going to be
[1:47:19] afraid to Stand
[1:47:21] Alone number two you're not going to be
[1:47:24] ashamed of telling your friends about
[1:47:27] the
[1:47:28] word whether they call you a fanatic or
[1:47:31] not whether they call you a foolish or
[1:47:34] not you will be ready to testify to your
[1:47:37] friends and your peers and your
[1:47:39] coworkers about this
[1:47:46] message and so could you
[1:47:48] imagine burning the holy ghost out of a
[1:47:51] man
[1:47:54] it cannot be done notice I can see the
[1:47:57] king set out himself upon a
[1:48:01] throne they bound these Hebrew
[1:48:05] children they put them in the front of a
[1:48:07] spear and started walking up a platform
[1:48:10] that they were to fall into this great
[1:48:18] furnace I can hear s message
[1:48:23] sure you prayed
[1:48:25] through you know sometimes when Satan
[1:48:27] puts the heat
[1:48:29] on we have to stop and check
[1:48:34] up so they they said Lord do I truly
[1:48:38] believe you I can hear s
[1:48:42] say yes I've prayed up now the God said
[1:48:48] you want to take that back boy you want
[1:48:51] to take back that boy
[1:48:57] no we are willing to seal Our
[1:49:00] Testimony with our own
[1:49:03] life we are ready
[1:49:06] now we are ready now I wonder how many
[1:49:10] are ready
[1:49:12] now to seal their own
[1:49:16] testimony with their own
[1:49:19] life by the way let me tell you if this
[1:49:22] Bible cannot produce
[1:49:28] radicals it is not worth
[1:49:31] preaching we should have people who are
[1:49:33] really radical Believers of the
[1:49:37] Bible ready even to
[1:49:41] die we have seen Muslims who are ready
[1:49:44] to
[1:49:45] die and even to kill others because of
[1:49:48] their
[1:49:50] religion I met a brother young
[1:49:53] man who a somal some years ago who you
[1:49:58] know he was living in Somalia then lived
[1:50:00] this
[1:50:01] message and then you know they started
[1:50:04] hunting him down because you see these
[1:50:06] people are radicals the radical
[1:50:10] Muslims the more if you are part of
[1:50:12] their
[1:50:13] religion and you leave they hunt you
[1:50:16] down and they kill
[1:50:19] you and whoever does that is respected
[1:50:23] highly
[1:50:25] among so this brother was in Nairobi I
[1:50:29] think at a fourth or fifth
[1:50:31] floor and this man came you know they
[1:50:34] they they they know how to track they
[1:50:36] tracked him
[1:50:39] down and and and you know they came and
[1:50:42] pushed him
[1:50:43] over and you know he fell from the
[1:50:46] fourth
[1:50:48] floor came you
[1:50:50] know and then fell down right on the
[1:50:55] floor on the
[1:50:57] ground but you know what God kept him
[1:51:02] not even a
[1:51:05] born now you tell me that Jesus Christ
[1:51:09] is not the same yesterday to
[1:51:12] for and I met that man with his family
[1:51:15] and was so happy about this message
[1:51:18] saying oh I'm ready and willing and I'm
[1:51:21] ready to die I know any time they may
[1:51:24] find but I'm ready and I am willing to
[1:51:29] die we will not kill anybody but we
[1:51:32] should be ready to give our own life if
[1:51:36] that is what it
[1:51:38] took for the word of
[1:51:44] God praise the name of the Lord all the
[1:51:48] disciples did just that
[1:51:54] now sometimes when sat puts heat on
[1:51:57] okay okay now say now we're willing to
[1:52:00] seal Our Testimony with our own
[1:52:04] life I can hear Nebuchadnezzar say now
[1:52:07] if you will bow down to the
[1:52:10] image I will take it
[1:52:14] back no we've taken our our way with the
[1:52:18] Lord is despised few
[1:52:22] I'm going through with
[1:52:24] it the time was for
[1:52:27] decisions just a few minutes
[1:52:31] left many of you are sitting here
[1:52:33] tonight in that same
[1:52:36] condition had trouble Bound in these
[1:52:40] chairs and on these crouches and things
[1:52:43] to you it may be something else just a
[1:52:46] few minutes left in this
[1:52:48] meeting he says make your
[1:52:51] decisions the time has come for you to
[1:52:54] do
[1:52:55] it either you've got to believe what
[1:52:58] I've said to be the
[1:53:00] truth oh what God has WR his
[1:53:03] Bible walk away in the same
[1:53:06] condition but the time has come now let
[1:53:09] me tell you recently I preached on a
[1:53:12] subject and I really recommend it to
[1:53:14] every believer to go and listen to
[1:53:17] it those who follow our ministry here
[1:53:20] the danger of turning down the word
[1:53:25] time
[1:53:27] comes where you have to either believe
[1:53:29] the
[1:53:30] truth follow what the Bible
[1:53:32] says walk away in the same
[1:53:36] condition that time comes for every
[1:53:41] human and I told you that this
[1:53:44] word has power to change
[1:53:47] anyone it has power to change anyone no
[1:53:50] matter how bad they are
[1:53:54] it has power to do that I've seen it
[1:53:57] change me my
[1:53:58] life but whenever you are presented with
[1:54:02] the
[1:54:04] truth and you turn it
[1:54:08] down that moment you turned it
[1:54:11] down your ears are
[1:54:13] sealed your eyes are
[1:54:16] sealed your eyes are sealed your ears
[1:54:18] are sealed you can no longer be red
[1:54:24] you become
[1:54:28] unredeemable you walk away the same in
[1:54:30] the same
[1:54:32] condition and I can hear him say all
[1:54:34] right walk them
[1:54:37] up the heat begin to get a little
[1:54:40] bad don't worry if you accept him
[1:54:43] tonight as your
[1:54:45] healer Satan will put the heat on you
[1:54:49] tomorrow don't you worry about that
[1:54:53] they started walking a little
[1:54:55] further I can hear him say are you sure
[1:54:58] you have prayed
[1:55:00] up y all right got right up the steps to
[1:55:06] about one
[1:55:09] step they begin to feel
[1:55:12] fainty like they was going
[1:55:15] in in a few minutes I can see these Gods
[1:55:19] with their Spears ready to push them
[1:55:21] over into the f
[1:55:26] that was heat seven times hotter than it
[1:55:29] ever was his
[1:55:32] head just listen to these
[1:55:35] words notice we are painting an awful
[1:55:38] dark picture down
[1:55:43] here but let's turn our
[1:55:47] camera up this way
[1:55:50] once oh my always when there is anything
[1:55:54] wrong going on down
[1:55:57] here there is something going on up
[1:56:02] there there is always two sides to
[1:56:06] eat when Saturn is on the
[1:56:09] job Jesus is
[1:56:11] also who you yield your faith
[1:56:15] to that's the way it's
[1:56:19] going give your faith to Christ
[1:56:23] let's look up this way you know I can
[1:56:27] see him sitting up there in his
[1:56:30] majesty his Priestly
[1:56:34] robes dropped around him looking
[1:56:37] down I see him coming to his uh right a
[1:56:41] great
[1:56:43] angel I see I see to his right coming a
[1:56:46] great
[1:56:48] Angel his name is Gabriel great
[1:56:51] archangel
[1:56:53] he comes running up he pulls his sword
[1:56:57] he said master master have you looked
[1:57:01] down in
[1:57:02] Babylon your people is taking a stand
[1:57:05] for you down
[1:57:07] there the hour has
[1:57:09] come for them to stand and they are
[1:57:13] taking a
[1:57:14] stand how many are taking a stand
[1:57:18] tonight but the bunch of the of the
[1:57:20] people there
[1:57:23] but that bunch of people
[1:57:25] there is going to push them into that
[1:57:29] FY and Gabriel said let me go down there
[1:57:34] I will clean that thing
[1:57:36] up many times we do not
[1:57:40] realize how many host of
[1:57:43] angels are willing and ready to come to
[1:57:45] our rescue whenever we are in
[1:57:49] trouble whenever you take a stand
[1:57:53] I stand for the word I stand for Christ
[1:57:57] I Stand For
[1:57:58] righteousness I stand for Holiness
[1:58:01] whenever you take that
[1:58:03] stand all Heaven is on your
[1:58:07] side all Heaven is behind
[1:58:09] you but why do you feel alone
[1:58:13] sometimes because God doesn't want to
[1:58:15] send Angels
[1:58:18] just he wants to come himself
[1:58:22] he wants to show his
[1:58:24] glory he wants to manifest his
[1:58:28] majesty Hallelujah and and Gabriel said
[1:58:31] let me go and clean the thing
[1:58:33] up I believe you could have done
[1:58:36] it yes sir he said he will give his
[1:58:39] angels charge over
[1:58:41] this and I believe the angels of God are
[1:58:44] encamped about those who
[1:58:50] fear Hallelujah
[1:58:53] hallelujah praise God we have a song
[1:58:55] that says the storms
[1:58:59] re
[1:59:02] dark they won't worry
[1:59:05] me I'm
[1:59:08] shelter within the arms of
[1:59:12] God he walks with
[1:59:15] me listen and not of Earth shall
[1:59:20] me I am sh
[1:59:25] The Arms Of
[1:59:28] God he always fights for the
[1:59:30] weak he always fights for the Fain he
[1:59:34] always fights for those who have no
[1:59:36] strength because he's their
[1:59:38] strength and in this case the little
[1:59:41] flock has always had a host of angels
[1:59:44] around
[1:59:46] them to protect them to watch over them
[1:59:51] to keep God for them praise the name of
[1:59:54] the Lord and so I can hear Gabriel
[1:59:59] say I'll I'll go down
[2:00:02] there I'll strike Babylon off the
[2:00:05] map if you let me go down
[2:00:08] there have you considered
[2:00:11] them I can hear the master
[2:00:14] say yes
[2:00:16] Gabriel you are a wonderful Angel you've
[2:00:19] obeyed me and youve set that my right
[2:00:21] hand
[2:00:23] the day I created you but I can't let
[2:00:26] you
