[20:21] turn to the scripture um
[20:34] i have a lot to talk about today so i
[20:36] hope that uh time will be enough for us
[20:40] to contribute
[20:42] tomorrow i'm continuing with our subject
[20:44] which we started uh the past week
[20:52] and uh really
[20:54] no one
[20:56] should should have missed this i'm a
[20:58] cemetery and now yeah they asked watch
[21:01] you know and those who have missed
[21:03] please
[21:04] no make sure you send them
[21:06] the link and encourage them to
[21:09] uh watch this summer
[21:30] and
[21:32] but also at the same time i'll be
[21:34] speaking on part four of these three
[21:35] things
[21:36] [Music]
[21:42] you
[21:57] but mccabe in trevis are trevino
[21:59] number one
[22:02] the pride of life
[22:04] problem
[22:06] the last of yeah
[22:13] so now so this would be like a part four
[22:16] to that
[22:17] subject we talked about category
[22:22] also it will be part two of the snares
[22:25] of a child of god
[22:32] on the same subject
[22:36] so we are reading from the glacier
[22:38] chapter 7 verse
[22:41] [Music]
[22:52] we come before you
[22:54] reverently this evening
[22:59] we ask that you will come and give us
[23:01] the bread of life today to serve you to
[23:03] many romantic problems speak to us
[23:21] and also my brothers and sisters as they
[23:23] listen
[23:26] to and even those that shall watch and
[23:28] listen to this later now
[23:31] it is
[23:32] in jesus name
[23:35] i mean verse 26
[23:41] and i find more bitter than death the
[23:43] woman
[23:45] whose heart is snares and nets
[23:49] and her hands as parents
[23:52] whoso pleases god shall escape from her
[23:55] but the sinner shall be taken by her
[23:59] endeavors
[24:22] [Music]
[24:28] the snares of a child of god
[24:42] if the lord speaks to you
[24:55] and i find more better than death
[24:57] so we found out that it is more bitter a
[25:00] woman rather a woman whose
[25:02] heart is
[25:03] snares and necks is more bitter than
[25:05] death
[25:11] timber move
[25:25] about that woman the mystery of babylon
[25:30] she's called mystery babylon
[25:33] about the mother of hallows
[25:36] and all the abominations of the earth
[25:39] of your neighbors so we noticed that
[25:40] this spiritual woman
[25:42] contracted evangelion
[25:45] means the church which is supposed to be
[25:47] the church or wife to jesus christ
[25:51] [Music]
[25:53] she actually rejected jesus christ
[26:00] and because she rejected the headship of
[26:02] jesus christ
[26:12] [Music]
[26:21] because she replaced the teachings of
[26:23] the true word of god for her own creeds
[26:26] and dogmas
[26:31] and other doctrines that are not truly
[26:34] the word of god
[26:40] like believing in you know teaching
[26:42] penitence or mr penitencio teaching
[26:45] purgatory
[26:47] somebody can die and then they can be
[26:49] prayed for and then
[27:05] so we found out that this the bible
[27:07] calls it the wine of half fornication
[27:13] and she's making all the kings of the
[27:15] world and the peoples of the world both
[27:16] great and small to partake of that wine
[27:20] [Music]
[27:27] [Music]
[28:07] and these daughters are having
[28:10] these daughters are also having the same
[28:12] characteristics of their mother
[28:38] that came out of the major uh
[28:40] denomination which is the roman catholic
[28:42] church
[28:43] [Music]
[28:47] and whenever they come out of the roman
[28:49] catholic church
[28:52] they also form denominations
[28:56] their own denominations
[28:58] praise the lord my name is
[29:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[29:03] are you following me
[29:08] and this brother banham says that
[29:10] whenever they denominated
[29:14] they died
[29:16] and whenever they die
[29:18] god leaves them
[29:20] whenever they die
[29:23] the revival moves on
[29:39] uh but having no holiness
[29:43] but rejecting the life
[29:46] and the life is in the world
[29:49] is somebody following me this evening
[29:52] the life is in the
[30:02] [Applause]
[30:21] systems
[30:22] in food the dead systems of man in kuala
[30:25] lumpur we have been set free
[30:28] tomorrow and throughout
[30:29] the dead systems
[30:33] and now
[30:34] that's not all
[30:37] and now we saw that
[30:39] this woman
[30:44] types the church she finally checked
[30:49] this woman types the church
[30:51] [Music]
[30:53] hallelujah amen
[30:57] and i wanted to listen to what the
[30:59] prophet of god says here and this is
[31:00] what we read also last time
[31:10] there is the there is
[31:12] there is three things that i've watched
[31:13] in my life he said one waving to be such
[31:16] a nikkei
[31:42] will give him an opportunity to do a
[31:44] little more work for him
[31:49] or something
[31:51] the first thing that saturn goes to
[31:52] working with that minister is thrift is
[31:54] three things
[32:13] and he says that i am
[32:15] like a first
[32:17] like indeed in the garden of eden
[32:21] so now when the true church of the
[32:23] living god left this confusion of
[32:25] denominationalism
[32:32] [Music]
[32:41] take it the devil at first wanted to
[32:43] trap us by the spirit of this woman
[32:50] by denominational spirit
[32:53] religious spirits
[33:08] [Music]
[34:04] in those such places or maybe fought for
[34:07] foreign gave you
[34:08] people think about the matter was that
[34:11] the devil is
[34:13] in bad places only in the satani i
[34:16] remember phobia
[34:18] but i want to
[34:30] a problem
[34:31] or difficulty to a true
[34:47] the devil in the d in a discontent does
[34:49] not cause a snare to me
[34:55] the devil among those people who take
[34:58] alcohol the drunkards and the smokers
[35:01] and the weird smokers does not cause a
[35:03] threat to me
[35:10] he is working in them but allah
[35:28] there are someone some which are
[35:30] remaining
[35:35] and the moment the last one comes into
[35:37] the body of christ
[35:41] the rapture will happen
[35:54] [Music]
[35:57] a german academy is in a place that a
[36:00] child of god is expected to be
[36:03] oman
[36:05] and what place is that
[36:08] you that place is in the churches
[36:22] they decide to praise god
[36:39] and that is why
[36:40] it is
[36:41] hallelujah man i said hallelujah
[36:44] hallelujah that is why yes
[36:47] i find that it is in the religious order
[36:52] hey
[37:34] where the
[38:15] you find very many people
[39:01] [Applause]
[39:12] two people a thousand or two hundred or
[39:15] four hundred i don't care i preach the
[39:16] same
[39:17] timing
[39:21] why because the word of god
[39:24] is going to intend to come to you today
[39:53] and you can begin to overcome
[40:07] these three things come to ministers
[40:22] that i
[40:28] [Applause]
[40:37] the ones who are serving the lord
[40:40] those are the ones
[40:43] that the devil is intending to let us
[40:44] know
[40:48] and which the snails will hear you

[44:46] cover hallelujah and i did not want to
[44:49] spread it to the next service because
[44:51] the next service i have something let's
[44:53] talk about
[44:54] i mean hallelujah
[44:57] and jesus being full of the holy ghost
[44:59] returned from jordan and was led by the
[45:01] spirit into the wilderness

[48:56] foreign
[49:30] he promised him
[49:32] that he will fly
[49:36] the devil was literally telling jesus
[49:40] go down and fly
[49:46] [Music]
[50:08] amen that he should take a little bit of
[50:10] the pride of life
[50:25] god pokemon
[50:27] and when the devil attended all
[50:29] the temptation
[50:33] he departed from him
[50:37] what do we see here
[52:11] hallelujah
[52:30] the devil wants to blind
[52:33] you with money
[52:37] he never wants to do that
[52:39] he wants to blind the believers with
[52:41] money
[52:44] me you find them putting a big
[52:49] look at money as if it is the best in
[52:51] the world
[52:56] some people when it comes to money they
[52:58] can find salvation
[53:16] [Music]
[53:54] they can prophesy heaven on earth to you
[53:56] yes
[53:59] open your past to them saying god
[54:01] worried
[54:04] somebody give a little
[54:07] and then they'll pray for you
[55:17] close to jesus
[55:32] whether you bring your money or not what
[55:34] is this
[55:35] that's not what god wants
[55:38] a man called simon the sorcerer
[55:40] commander
[55:41] on your mother
[55:43] he brought money to the servants of god
[56:28] honestly at this moment i don't care if

[56:34] because i'm preaching the word
[56:37] now this is nothing against rich people
[56:39] about abandonment

[57:53] because you are so poor
[57:57] you have nothing

[58:00] that's why you should not be
[58:04] any of them

[58:32] business
[58:34] but those
[58:50] have not the faith of our lord jesus
[58:53] of jesus christ with respect to persons

[1:00:11] marvelous
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:53] your business
[1:00:57] the bible says god be here you can't be
[1:00:59] the man that trusts in a man

[1:01:56] of the spirit comes only to a life
[1:01:58] consecrated to the word
[1:03:01] is
[1:03:04] that only the
[1:03:05] poor will go to heaven

[1:32:11] service never been any services
[1:32:17] because they have most of them are
[1:32:18] inspired
[1:32:20] by the church of god
[1:32:22] dynamics
[1:32:35] is
[1:33:05] i was raised in a very spiritual family

[1:36:16] life
[1:36:22] was lying there with under with with
[1:36:25] with unwashed feet yes
[1:36:34] what does that symbolize
[1:36:38] what is it to do with
[1:36:39] popularity or the pride of life
[1:36:44] jesus was poor
[1:36:47] them were rich man
[1:36:49] so they put jesus in a corner
[1:37:04] that big is he asked my lord to come and
[1:37:07] let him sit over there with that dung on
[1:37:09] his feet
[1:37:15] he wouldn't give him any oil
[1:37:18] after
[1:37:47] in the church these days
[1:37:52] you see someone shutting tears
[1:37:57] when was the last time you shot tears in
[1:37:59] the church
[1:38:00] whatever
[1:38:11] behaving like an evangelistic
[1:38:16] if
[1:38:17] you are you have not washed jesus's feet
[1:38:20] with your tears
[1:38:24] you are acting like the pharisees
[1:38:27] if you have not anointed him with oil oh
[1:38:30] what's the name of calculation how do
[1:38:32] you do that
[1:38:33] by getting into the holy ghost
[1:38:37] by allowing yourself to be swayed away
[1:38:39] by the power of all the gods
[1:38:57] i'm afraid i'm a canister
[1:39:00] there is no oil
[1:39:01] in my face there is no water to wash
[1:39:02] jesus
[1:39:08] and jesus is in the corner
[1:39:10] with
[1:39:38] oh
[1:39:53] it is supposed to be a place hey take it
[1:39:56] back what you feel where we come to
[1:39:57] watch jesus
[1:39:59] open us
[1:40:01] with our tears namaste
[1:40:05] if there is no tears there is no
[1:40:06] conviction but whatever my secret
[1:40:09] is the one it is just religion
[1:40:13] jesus's feet is that dead maybe you're
[1:40:16] gonna be is to be jammer it needs to be
[1:40:18] washed

[1:40:49] have a i can't understand let me
[1:40:50] see
[1:40:51] it i can't understand this transfer

[1:41:00] cow

[1:41:04] why did the people hate pentecostals
[1:41:06] when they first started out why child
[1:41:08] and tobacco happened
[1:41:11] because they were washing jesus
[1:41:15] with the tears
[1:41:34] they said we cannot we cannot identify
[1:41:36] with ourselves
[1:41:37] we cannot make fools out of us and to
[1:41:39] struggle away from our civil rights we
[1:41:41] are educated to us
[1:41:44] we are sober people together we know
[1:41:47] what you're talking about you don't get
[1:41:48] a good treatment
[1:41:49] so how can we stoop so low
[1:41:57] oh god that mercy on

[1:43:26] than being in a horrible cast
[1:43:35] that's what it means to be pentecostal
[1:44:04] hallelujah
[1:44:44] looking on
[1:45:16] leaping and dancing
[1:45:19] before the lord

[1:46:38] come and sing for us to the body you
[1:46:39] don't come and sing

[1:46:47] we want people who are kind of singing
[1:46:49] specials
[1:46:51] getting acid to the spirit
[1:47:48] so can you see that the brother or
[1:47:50] sister who was inspired to write that
[1:47:52] song
[1:47:56] was under another age
[1:48:01] yes
[1:48:02] that was
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:42] oh
[1:49:13] that's the reason why
[1:49:15] some of these songs we sing without
[1:49:17] revelation we should stop singing
[1:49:22] if a song that comes on the pulpit i'm
[1:49:24] going to say
[1:49:25] speak about the song we are going to say
[1:49:53] and so when someone comes to sing a song

[1:49:59] just look on you
[1:50:01] get into the worship english season get
[1:50:03] into the prayers

[1:50:20] what was even dancing too
[1:50:22] yeah
[1:51:44] i will
[1:51:48] hallelujah amen that's because of the
[1:51:51] word going
