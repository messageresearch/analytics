35 to 42 [Music] wa [Music] [Music] B [Music] for [Music] for amen amen Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of the day and the hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as it is in the days that were before the flood they were eaten and drinken and marrying and given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them away so shall also the coming of the C of man be then shall two be in the field and one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the Mill the one shall be taken and the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come amen you may have your seats this evening by the grace of God we want to encourage you we want to encourage you and strengthen you by the word the efforts of man can do [Music] nothing the ability of man can do [Music] nothing but the word of God is what we need and when the word comes by your way it is the food you need in due season it gives you strength to overcome it gives you strength in prayer it gives you strength in Walking it gives you strength in talking it gives you strength amongst your peers friends gives you strength amongst your co-workers and and it's a light that shines light that shines in the midst of a dark world so by the grace of God this evening we want to speak on Christ the revealed word is the Ark of Safety Jesus Christ the revealed word is the Ark of [Applause] Safety so the Bible said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man if we look back to the days of Noah we find out they were doing the same thing that we're doing today they were eating they were drinking they were carousing they were building houses buying lands but they were missing the revealed word for their hour they were missing the revealed word for their hour so it took a prophet coming in this generation to turn our hearts back to the revealed word Jesus Christ is the Ark of Safety and Christ is the revealed word for this hour and the fullness of life of Jesus Christ has been loosed to the believer at the opening and the unveiling of the Seven Seals when the seals were open it Loos the power to the believer it Loos an anointing to the believer to give them strength in this hour to overcome every Power Of Satan to overcome every force of darkness and that's why the Bible says that no weapon formed against you shall prosper no weapon formed against you shall [Music] prosper and any tongue that rises up against you you shall condemn for this is the heritage of the Servants of the lord of the Servants of the Lord so do you realize that is your possession every promise in the scripture belongs to you when you come into this body when you come into this body the body of Jesus Christ every promise in the book belongs to you and Faith cometh by hearing the word and when you hear the word it gives you the faith to receive the word hold to lay hold lay hold lay hold lay hold lay hold of every scripture amen Amen brother brandham said and I believe that this Universal Revival that's sweeping the lands today is an indication of the message like it was in the days of Noah while men and women are rioting in sin and Noah had a ftic [Music] gospel that he preached but he called the people to an arc of [Music] safety and I believe that the Glorious [Music] Gospel of the Son of God manifested by the Holy Ghost it's sweeping the country today and bringing the people into the ark which is Jesus Christ safely secured from all the judgments that's going come and when the judgments strike and the atomic powers and the Rocks the Nations and the atomic Powers rocks the Nations will ride above the waves into Glory [Music] this word that God has sent in this hour is your protection this message that God has sent through the voice of William brandham is your [Music] safety this message that God has sent in this hour through the voice of William brandham is your rest is your rest amen I want to show you something here so Noah was a type of the remnant the Jews that were carried through the tribulation but Enoch was a type of the true church he was a type of the elected bride that did not go through the tribulation but was caught away in the Rapture so the prophet of God would say that Enoch was a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ brother R said now it's the same thing today we are at the end time now those people ought to have known people Noah was a type of the Jews that will be carried over to the [Music] tribulation Enoch was a type of the real [Music] message for Enoch was taken up and then the flood came and now the church will be taken away so that God can deal with the [Music] Jews the 144,000 as we've been through the scriptures something I want to show you in the scripture is the type of the Ark there's four examples of the Ark in the scripture and we want to talk about a few of them the first one is Noah's Ark the Bible says here in Genesis chapter 6 God speaking to Noah he said make the an ark of gopherwood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with [Music] pitch so brother Baron would say that the gopherwood was a type of the believer because the goer wood was soft and Hollow soft and Hollow so listen what brother Braham said here the ark was made out of gopherwood it's nothing but just Hollow everything is taken out of it it's grow that way the lightest wood there is the lightest wood there is now why did they do [Music] that so it could soak it in with [Music] pitch and the real seed of God is an absorbent for the spirit all denominations is took out all unbelief is [Music] out and when the Holy Spirit comes into the germ of life when the Holy Spirit comes into the germ of life it produces another seed just exactly another Son of God another daughter of God when that seed comes into the presence of a Shak Glory will bring the life that's in the sea it will bring forth the life that's in the sea amen another amateur God another miniature Creator another Creator do you realize that's who you are your Minature creators your amateur Gods what you say I don't feel like it you say I don't feel like it you you say I don't feel it I don't look like it it doesn't matter what you feel like it doesn't matter your level of Education it doesn't matter how much money you have but what matters is what God Said in his [Applause] word God said in his word that you are more than conquerors you are more than conquerors and greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world what than he that's in the world greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world Amen you're you're a mighty Army and when you recognize who you are the prophet said you're an invincible [Applause] Army you're an invincible Army praise God hallelujah amen see what I'm trying to show you tonight is that you are [Music] actually you become the ark and I prove to you in the scripture that you become the [Applause] ark hey that's not skin milk yes that's not skin milk that's Eagle food amen the eagle is a ripper of the beak Ripper of the beak eat with the beak e meat the eagle doesn't drink milk the eagle eats [Music] meat and when you when you're born again you become a little eagle and you start eating the meat of the word amen amen if you feel like running around this service feel free if you feel like break loose in the spirit go ahead yes if you want to break loose in the spirit go ahead I know we have a few minutes but let's let the Holy Ghost move if you come here with a knee you can walk out free tonight if you sickness in your body you can walk out healed tonight unsaved loved one unsaved loved one the Holy Ghost that's present here can go after that seat of God and bring them to their ought toe [Music] condition my church if if you feel backsliding if you feel backsliding the Holy Ghost is here to reignite the fire in your life amen hallelujah so realize the pitch now was a type of the atonement that pitch brother Braham says it means to atone it means to stand between stand between it means to intercede so now this pitch was in between the gopherwood it was to be sealed Within and without a type of the Holy Ghost not just a little bit here a little bit there but a fulfilling of the believer to fill the believer inside and out from the inside it changes your nature and from the outside is expressed in life this holy ghost power that was loose to the message of the hour it brings forth a holy life brings forth a consecrated life that's what consecrated life that when you walk when you talk when you talk when you think the world wonders what happened to you but you can tell them that I've become an ark I've become part of the Ark of Jesus Christ you become the gopherwood filled with the [Music] pitch that makes up the Ark of Jesus Christ it begins to make up the body the body of Jesus Christ to reach out to a sick and dying world the Bible says that you are a light set upon a hill set upon a hill on Hill amen you are the light of the world Amen do you realize that being part of the body in Christ the revealed word word is your atonement by being born again and becoming part of the revealed word of this hour the revealed word is your atonement it's your protection from the wrath of God that's coming upon this this age it's your protection from the judgments of God that's coming upon this world what you say brother Victor what are you talking about life is good life is good I have my friends I have my associates I have my job I have my wife I have my husband I have my kids I have everything that makes me comfortable but do you realize this message came to prepare us for our body change we have not been called to stay here we've not been called to remain upon this Earth the seat of God inside of you is longing for a body change it's longing to leave this world leave this world and put on a body Immortal and that's why the word came by your way to Quicken or make alive the seed of God that laid there before the foundation of the world [Applause] and you are the seed of God that's why you can be reborn for only the seed of God can be born again because being born again is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you so it takes the Holy Ghost that's present here tonight to reveal the word to you that you may realize that I'm not from here I've come from above I came from God and I'm going back to God I came from eternity I'm not an Earthbound chicken I'm a heavenbound eagle and that's why God sent the is Anointed to lift us out into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen give God a hand clap of Praise hallelujah amen hallelujah this is good amen amen if you want me if you need me to slow down just say slow down if you want if you need me to slow down say slow down amen here we go but the Ark of [Music] Safety it's not a building Glory the Ark of Safety is not a denomination it's not a denomination the Ark of Safety is not an organization The Arc of safety is not Creeds and dogmas of man the Ark of Safety is the living revealed body [Applause] word that God has made known in this day through a prophet and the elected of each age caught the revealed word the elected of each age caught the revealed word and thereby they were safe amen let me say it again the Ark of God is not a building the Ark of God is Not denominational ideas but the Ark of God is the living revealed [Applause] word that's been made known in this hour and when that word becomes revealed in you the things of the world leave the desires of the world leave the drinking goes the smoking goes the smoking it goes the swearing goes cussing wrong language V language [Applause] those things go the movies go all the filth of the world leaves your life because the the revealed word has now pushed the desires of the world out amen church when that word comes into your life come again when the word comes into your life it drives out everything that's not of God when that word comes into you it changes your very nature where the desires of the world are not there anymore hallelujah it's like this maybe a year ago you to do this and do that but you came across the message you came across the word you came across the prophet and as you listened you didn't fully understand but you contined to listen continue to feed on the word continue to come to church continue to come to church and listen to your pastor and listen to the word and little by little something begins to change your desires begin to change your hunger begins to change your thirst begins to change and then year goes by or month goes by you look around you realize you're dress right the sensors are dressed right you look clean you stop for a minute you say what happened to me you look inside and you find out your desires have changed home has changed because you've had an encounter with the Mighty God you met you've met the person of Jesus Christ you've had an encounter with the revealed word and changed you amen hallelujah Church it changed you amen it changed you amongst your friends change you at your workplace you look around and you say I'm blessed well you say I don't have no money in the bank listen let me say something see God don't work by money God doesn't work by money God works by spirit and when that spirit of God is present that God provides your every need he provides your financial needs he provides your marital needs he provides the needs in your home he provides the needs in your spirit because you surrendered everything my father says that he owns a cattle in a thousand hills so it seems like things aren't working out but one day you'll be walking one day you'll be walking and you'll look back and be like my God provided all my because you gave your All to Jesus Christ amen I said it before I'll say it again I said it before I'll say it again sorry I said it before I'll say it again God will be indebted to no man God will not be indebt to any man amen God will be in debt to no man so whatever you've surrendered for God he will pour back a hundredfold but I want to say something the denominational mindset of that scripture is that God is going to give me lands and wealth and money but I want you to I want you to stop for a minute and look around you and realize that God has given you family God has given you Brothers and Sisters in Christ God has given you a family in Canada God has given you a pastor that loves this message God's giv you message books if you don't have message books come talk to me if you don't have message books come talk to me I'll talk to brother [Music] bus see the the things that God pours in isn't just material sometimes it's spiritual he pours in more faith he pours in a greater desire to pray he pours in more love he pours in a greater passion for the word he pours on a greater desire for the things of God he pours in confidence he pours in boldness amongst your friends and your family he pours in boldness to stand on the street yes he pours in boldness to stand on the street and testify of what Jesus has done in your life God pours in all you have to do is surrender all to Jesus Christ give him everything give him your love give him your faith you say I have a little bit of faith Bible said that a Mustard Seed Faith can move a big mountain so you put that little faith to work and it begins to move the mountains in your life but you say I struggle with depression I struggle with anxiety suicidal Spirits suicidal Spirits suicidal suicide spirits Spirits have lost all these demon powers that are released to this [Music] age the spirits of [Applause] Hollywood creeping that creeping crawling this message gives you power over those Spirits oh church this message when you catch the revelation of who you are I oh my I challenge you tonight I challenge oh my I feel I feel it in my spirit I challenge you tonight if you believe this word that I'm preaching if there's any sick amongst us they'll leave healed tonight any bow here they'll leave fre believe the word all things are possible hallelujah amen hallelujah praise our God the second Arc is the Ark of the Covenant how many know the Ark of the Covenant in the scripture so the Ark of the Covenant now that Ark was made out of shittim wood wood Ora wood and it was overlaid with pure gold it was overlaid with gold the Bible says here and thou shalt overlay with pure gold within and without shout th overlay it listen people want to people want to come yes people want to come and tell you this Bible's not real oh my the theologians and all sorts of ideas of man want to take the power out of the scripture but I want to show you a little seed and I want to tell you that God doesn't make mistakes what God Said in his word he will fulfill every promise in the book it is yay and amen so here the Bible says God said overlay the ark overlay the ark with pure gold do you did you notice that the ark that Noah built was also overlaid with pitch inside and out God's order doesn't change God's order doesn't change what he did in Genesis he will do in Revelations what he did a year ago he will do again today because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday day and forever and if you can believe tonight for whatever is you need whatever you need and brother Ram said if you come on the same basis of faith God is obligated to meet your need hallelujah [Music] amen hallelujah amen so I want you to notice how I want to get to something here I'm going to skip through some of this here for the sake of time now overlaid with pure gold gold speaks of deity gold speaks of deity okay pure gold speaks of deity and the Bible says that you should Crown the ark with gold crown it with gold which speaks of Splendor or sovereignty or honor now what I want to show you here for a few minutes is that the Ark of the Covenant which is Christ was also speaking of you so the Ark in the scripture is speaking also of the bride of Christ you have to realize that all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he's poured into the church so you become life of his life bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his spirit amen amen so here we are that the that the Ark of the Covenant now was made after the pattern of the Tabernacle amen and and and part of that Arc of the [Music] Covenant was the mercy seat and the and the mercy seat which no one could approach brother Ram [Music] says unless there was an atonement when it was sprinkled with blood then it became The Mercy Seat but but after the blood was taken [Music] off then it became a judgment [Music] [Applause] seat amen so brother Brown says this holy fire from the altar being passed from lamp to [Music] lamp is a wonderful type of of the holy spirit in the seven Church ages the original outpouring of [Music] Pentecost which outpouring came Direct from Jesus on The Mercy Seat is end doing his church through all the Seven Ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same amen so this holy fire the fire that Lit the candlesticks in Revelations God lit every age but now in this last day the outpouring of Pentecost the outpouring of Pentecost was not a denomination it was an experience and so when Pentecost stopped and became a Pentecostal organization they died right there because God kept moving on God kept moving on to the unveiling of the message of this hour come again sorry God kept moving on to the unveiling of the message of this hour and that's why God's been going through the land sounding forth the message calling some out of Baptist calling some out of the Baptist some out of the wans some out of [Music] Pentecost into the body of Jesus Christ Church we've not been we've not been called into another church we've not been called into another organization we've been called into the body of Jesus Christ and the body is the [Applause] word the word revealed in this hour is the body word of the son of man Hallelujah glory amen am and you and the word become one United you be become The Dwelling Place The Dwelling Place of the Living [Music] God so I want you to note something here it wasn't uh it wasn't just the structure of the Ark what the structure that saved the people it wasn't touching the Ark of the Covenant that save the people but if you realize in the scripture there was a word that went forth [Music] first God said through his [Music] Prophet come into the ark God said through his Prophet Joshua let the Ark of the Covenant it go before the people it wasn't the the stone and the wood and the [Music] metals it was the word that delivered the people it was the word that was the protection it was the word that brought the people into safety it was the word that was the atonement for the hour it was the word that kept over the people and it's the word today that keeps the people it's the word today that keeps the church it's the word today that heals every sickness that heals every disease it's the word today that transforms lives it's the word today that raises the dead it's the word today that turns the life around it's the word today that changes you Hallelujah church it's the word it's the word it's the word the revealed word in your day man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and this word is now taken on flesh being expressed again hour in you oh Church you are the Living Word made [Applause] manifest you are the Living [Applause] Word made manifest I'm trying to show you that you become the [Applause] ark this world needs to see when Christ comes into your life you become you begin to form this Arc I'll show you a quote said the Holy Spirit overlaid overlays the believer deity overlaying the believer and you become the ark today hallelujah amen number three quickly before the ark was Jesus Christ The Ark was Jesus Christ Christ came down and almighty God came down in Corporal body he took on flesh to redeem flesh God became man so man could become God CH God became man so man can become God oh glory be to God became man so man can become God become amateur creators on the Earth amen become the word of Flesh again Hallelujah listen the ark was fully expressed in flesh through Jesus Christ his work of redemption was fully manifested at Calvary when all the expressions of God was made manifest in his bride this bride was loosed from his side the Bible says that they took the spear and pierced it in Jesus High and the Bible said water and blood came forth and the prophet would pick that scripture up the prophet will picked that scripture and say the bride came out the side it was life of his life and spirit of his spirit so you came out of his side you were in him at Calvary you were in him when he died on the [Music] cross you say how is that so the Bible says that Jesus came to seek and save those who were lost if you were lost you were found once so that means that you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world so Jesus the expression of God came to find you amen and so when he died on the cross you were in a stinking and me you were in his stinking you were in his sing when he when he when he when he went into the grave you were still in a stinking and when he rose from the grave you were still in his sing so you died on the cross when Jesus died you were buried when Jesus was buried and you raised with him when Jesus rose from the de and the prophet would say that the resurrection is to tell to tell to show the world that Jesus is not dead but is still alive today you say where is he alive where is he alive he's alive in a many membered body hallelujah amen amen quickly church just so we I want to get to something I'm going to skip all these notes forgive me I'm sure you get the point you have become the ark when you receive the ark because you become the word when you receive the word and the Arc of safety is the revealed word of this hour and that's why denomination can't save you Creeds and dogmas of man can't save you other religions can't save you the Quran can't save you personal personal development books personal development they can't save you there's only one thing that can save you and that's the Living Word of God revealed in this hour hallelujah amen amen the Bible said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but the word of the Lord shall endure forever and so you can rest your soul upon every word of God now the next thing I want to go into before we close is I want to show you what the effects are in your life when this Ark is revealed in [Music] you so number one when you receive this Revelation it destroys the works of the [Music] enemy when you receive the word into your life it destroys the works of the [Music] enemy the Bible says in first John chapter 3 and ye know that he was manifest to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinth not whosoever sinth ha not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that hath done righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil amen look Satan for ages Satan for ages the Bible said he planted seeds after the good man of the house planted seeds and one of the servants came to Jesus and said or he said to the master he said should we pluck up the tears the good man of the house said leave it until Harvest Time at Harvest time would be gathered to the fire and the wheat will be gathered into the house we are at Harvest Time this is the hour of harvest time where all things are coming to maturity the power of Satan's coming to maturity the power of Satan is coming to maturity but the power of God is coming to maturity those possessed by demon powers are being exposed but this bride this invisible [Applause] Army is coming to full maturity putting every Power Of Darkness under their feet every demon power is under your feet and if Satan is not under your feet he's out of his place he's out of his place out of this place out of his place if Satan is not under your feet he's out a position because Satan position is to be under your feet amen hallelujah amen amen just a few more minutes sorry when this word is revealed in you it looses the elected it looses The Believer from all sin when this word is revealed in you it looses The Believer from all sin and sin is [Music] unbelief sin is unbelief in the word hallelujah so when this word comes into you it restores back your faith it restores back your joy It restores Back Your Love It Resto restes back everything that Satan has stolen from you amen it restores back your family restores back your children it restores back Health to weak body Health to the weak body hallelujah amen when this facei comes into you amen Amen brother Ram says here he trusted only himself God said he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and redeemed us unto himself we are saved by the blood of [Applause] God the Eternal blood of God the Eternal God indwelt a mortal body musicians why don't you come indwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it consider this consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if it is and if the sorry and if the perfect blood is loose in us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosen is perfect and [Music] complete hallelujah amen amen amen last one before we go [Music] here now this one's very dear to my [Music] heart but when this word comes into you it removes all fear Hallelujah all fear is gone when Jesus comes he breaks every fed and he looses the heart from fear fear of failure is [Applause] gone fear of harm is gone Fe fear of harm harm or [Music] hurt fear of death is gone this mess came to take the fear off the people the fear that [Music] came through the oppression of demonic Powers the fear that came over wrong teaching wrong teaching has been broken off of the believer at the revealing of this message this message has come to take the fear of the people church I got to read a quote listen to The [Music] Prophet that's what the trouble is with the
