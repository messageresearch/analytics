thank the Lord for our pasta and also other brethrens [Music] every day he checks on me so by God's Will I Know In the Flesh we shall be a bit because really after the service the Lord really spoke a lot to me and I know if God allows another time again the same message so there are also other stages and really I got that drive but I know when time comes we shall have that time we share again for those who are not there my name is I'm also a grown up man in the ministry foreign [Music] amen praise the Lord ah brother aguma I love him because he loves the Lord amen Amina he shared on a very good subject those who missed it you could check it out on YouTube that it will be a blessing I was just thinking about you this early morning I did expect to see you here there is a sister I'm not too sure whether she's here I forgot her name but there's a brother who are you here you know who I'm talking about if you're here just raise up your hands okay so I'm not too sure whether she's here there's a lady I think she goes at certain University all she's done I'm not I don't remember the details what's your brother's name Stephen odoy yeah she was he she was introduced to uh brother Stephen introduced her to me organized and I was supposed to meet her yesterday but we could make it but uh this morning I thought she's here probably be in touch with her later amen I mean so are we ready for the word this morning amen I mean so let us stand on our feet as we get ready to open the Bibles I also wanted to say that uh yesterday we had a good uh very good first meeting called some of his uh of the students the fellow students and we had a little over and I talked to them on the absolute the reception was great I had a few who came up and they said they needed prayers they wanted to really come closer to the Lord how many of them say that we should keep going back and so maybe one time we'll ask him to testify about that but uh there is something that God I believe has started in the entire there is among those students and uh there is one student there's one this one particular student that did not come there are known previously I thought I asked him to take me to tell me where he is I went and met him and by the time we were done talking he said ah I missed next time Reach Out [Laughter] is equals [Music] you will find is not too busy to him [Music] he's passing by this moment your needs to supply Reach Out And Touch the Lord as in he goes by one more time Reach Out And Touch the Lord can you join in if you can't now I see goes by this is what we should do you will find is not too busy to hear your words cry foreign [Music] by this moment your needs to stop light Reach Out untouched [Music] Lord Jesus we are reaching out to you this morning Father we realize that we are only relying on you and on your abilities [Music] may you speak to each of them may we go out of this place this morning when we are saying that indeed the Lord spoke to us those that need a deeper Closer Walk with You Lord may you grant it to them questions may you answer them those with burdens may you live father we desire for that touch of the supernatural this morning father we ask this believing in Jesus amen I mean so we're reading out of second Peter chapter one so chapter 1 verses 12. are we all there then community [Music] um maybe to be able to get the context we could begin from we could begin from uh verses before that again let us begin from verses 3 and then read through so that we can be able to get the whole uh according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence according to your faith virtue um excuse me and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patients and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ Crystal but he that lucky these things is blind and cannot see afarov and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins and Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall away for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ whatever I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth is speaking on the subject the message of the hour what you could call the present truth I've been on this subject now two weeks but I know that Ministries are different many times when I want to teach something and laid out very well little by little I notice that I'm all over the place I mean like I'm Evangelistic and that's that's my gift that's how God made me change you can only power out what I have and I can only power out what you brave from ask from God pray for the ministry of the word when you come in the church you are a hundred percent sure that what you will hear is from the Lord foreign this morning I don't know how many have prayed minister to them but if you have prayed I want to encourage you God will minister to you have not prayed I want to encourage right now you can say a little prayer in your house oh Lord may you speak to me I want to hear from you and I'm sure that he will speak to you praise the name of the Lord so friends we are in a time when looking around and seeing everything going around us we can clearly see that the world is departing from God and the world is departing from God systematically especially the most one of the most or actually the most dangerous ages age of all ages and that is the age we actually happen to live here its name is those Church ages where some of them people did not actually believe in God other ages people really believed in God [Music] and you know because the believer was ready to die for the truth I was not ready but you see in in the last age the Bible speaks of which in the Book of Revelation chapter 3. he has nothing nothing good to talk about the last age for if you can turn with me to the book of the Lord sorry to the Book of Revelation chapter three I'm thinking about Allah this year foreign and and I wanted to look at verse 14. of the Church of laodicean of the Lord's right these things says the amen the faithful and true witness the the beginning of the creation of God because and he says I Know Thy words are Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would that word called first of all the world is actually means people's rights so we are in an age or a generation of Rights whereby politically and according into our world Cosmos now people actually can do what they want to do and they have a right to do what they want to do because no one has a right to stop you from doing what you have a right to do you have a right to think that you are a cat or to think that you are a cow and everyone should respect your rights that age is now you might not see that kind of uh uh you know that kind of degradation actually here now or in Uganda it doesn't mean it is not in the world or in our age and really Hollywood feeds the rest of the world now these spirits come from there and go all over the world and the Bible says gross Darkness has covered the earth and the Bible here says that the people in laodicea they actually are not hot and they are not cold at the same time you know these are people who think that oh we are hot and oh we are called in other words when it comes to God and it comes to God this word they really want to profess that they are believers like in the Book of Romans chapter 1 it says that uh you know they say they believe the gospel but they deny the power of the gospel and so they are not actually outright it is saying we don't believe God quite frankly quite a few people who profess not to be Believers in God most people in this generation actually believe in God they said they believe in the existence of God they believe there is a God in heaven many of them will actually say they believe the Bible to be the truth actually even many of them say we are preaching the Bible read a Bible but here the Bible says they are not called and they are not hot [Music] and God is saying I would at least if you were called so then because now at lukewarm and neither called the heart I will spill thee out of my mouth know how many of you have ever taken lukewarm water is not good for the fruit if you take lukewarm water you'll feel like throwing it out again is that right you would rather take cold or you'd rather take you know when someone gives you a bottled water when it is not hot and it's not cold you know you you when you take it it tastes kind of funny you would rather have very cold water or very hot water and God is saying the people in laodice and God is saying because of this I will actually spill thee I'll spit you out of my mouth of me God tried in the fire again that you may be rich you may be close by the shame of your nakedness do not appear it is that that you may see [Music] this is the Council of God to buy that you may be rich buy clothes for me amen God has a white roommates it is God does not change says is the same yesterday today and foreign [Music] and this is what we have in the Holy Spirit foreign praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord when you you look at Israel as the natural Church you know God's Called Moses a message and really I I I I I I will in the morning very early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning God spoke to me and um regarding this portion that I want to bring in could you tune into this subject the three exoduses was with Moses and so God spoke to Moses and he gave him the word and when God when when Moses had this word he called out the people to come out of a system come out of Egypt there was a promise where they were going to go there was a place where this message was going to take them out of foreign foreign [Applause] that's not the new Bible hallelujah hallelujah and mothers preached and mothers left the city before the word was fulfilled but God is always Generations when mothers left the sins Rangers was it the same God yes oh yes he was because the promise of God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen what is the purpose of God from Genesis to Revelations of God is going to imprison usings and you know traditions and the ideas of mass [Music] and religions and and things like that producer the purpose of God the children of man for the son for the son of man is one this is but what did man do with it mastered groups and then they're like if you're not part of us you're lost if you're not among our group you're lost if you're not a member of our church but goddess purpose has never changed is a very important to know the message brings back the children of God the purpose of God was given in the very beginning Hallelujah and so friends I want you to follow me closely here when Joshua received this instruction [Music] which is right here in the Bible foreign and I read this many times but many of you are not here so let me read it again not one or not for one moment do I bring a message to follow me or join my church some fellowship and organizations that is the purpose of God to give us this Bible yes to re-establish us [Music] where men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and healed your lives completely to him as a trust in my heart that I have given all my all to him praise the name of the Lord praise the name of Allah in another message he says Hear Me God will not deal with his church she comes back to the homelands what we call the message of the house is not what Luther called the message not the Believers of that time you but what was it charity God katonda was restoring his truth I must see my back again to the church because by that time your whole truth that God is not building a line He is building a house he's not building a wall he's building a house he's building a house and so you see that he says upon faith [Music] [Applause] it has always been and that was the message Sarah all those who did not hear it they missed out [Music] was the main man of that time and the problem of it was they made a denomination listen listen they organized and whenever they organize [Music] and so he says come back to the originals precipitation ideas who is shouting this the messenger of the hour this is the message what we call the message they decide to be to make a denomination this message is not to denominate it's not just to be followers [Music] messages foreign [Music] they are all wrong under all of the devil but within them is godly people in every one of them movements in itself is not of God everybody will never bless he has never done it he will never bless him God will never bless an organization I I fear sometimes when I hear people think oh God has blessed days of the voice fellowships people refresh their denominationals their denominations and their Church names more than the purpose all over the world I think the most churches that don't have advertisements a message believing churches the reason being our emphasis our emphasis and that's why we don't put a lot of signposts and it's okay to do it but I'm saying the reason why we don't emphasize on that is because we have a message a message to take us back again about the organizations and he says every each age has had its message and its Messengers through the times every age has sparked its message with a messenger um God in every dispensation he has sent forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age and he says every time every foreign [Music] only two foreign God brought frogs sovereign [Music] foreign foreign imagine people foreign [Music] [Music] and because God knows that you know it is the only way for his children to him as an insurance A stranger's voice [Music] when normal world Chicago [Applause] foreign [Applause] that you are the only again not gonna hit we have been here some people are patient as long as things are working but when there is and these people they hanged on and I don't want to buy a cigarette since he had everything that noise [Music] according to it shows that there is no water in the atmosphere and that old Noah is actually duping and lying the people it has been proved because there is no water it is the ones who are willing to be lied too as far as I'm concerned and the Bible says when they fall away again that there shall be no restoration and then you go back again Jesus Christ there is no more repentance yes again let me follow him let me follow him again I don't know if Pastor never followed us some people who fall away from the church and they expect the pastor to follow them please come back sister always foreign you are ordained to life that's why even when you wanted to run away what happened there is a seed of God in here I want to stay here yeah this is my place praise the name of the Lord they made with eight Souls Noah's message was the truth because it was so for foreign Hallelujah man when he when we preach things that we preach it looks out of place how can you tell a young man that you don't have to fornicate until you married and we have received the message of the hours restored us back again to the Bible and you are going to have a people that will be perfect what is the message hallelujah amen God has restored us back to himself foreign there is no place where it is recorded anyway about the Holy Spirit without sensation there was sensation the Bible says there was a rushing baby let us speak it louder Mighty Wind how do you think it was sounding yeah [Music] foreign [Music] yeah man are you Tower and in a moment when I was drunk hallelujah hallelujah that's the god of the Bible That's the god of Pentecost there was more sure and our Prophet said in a religion has no emotions because [Applause] mother's performing that is out of that is an ideology but the message is not a thought it's not even just a mere learning and getting into the Mysteries that's not the message [Music] which is the message the word of God in the book of First timoth he says when the word of God comes to you foreign when you search you find that in our generation of us try to play with us and he has made this message by restoring us who are you people think that we have been restored Allah the message is not a place where there is a set of rules he wants his life to dwell in us he wants his life to come and move us doing the better things he did listen I'm about to conclude if you've seen the Old Testament in the Old Testament rules and regulations foreign man you are no longer going to struggle what to dress the Holy Ghost is going to show you what to dress you're not going to talk about your hair that's why people who don't believe in the Holy Spirit we have seen the message of the hour and our Prophet was asked questions one of the questions like the first time I preached on this I left this this hanging and I want to give a little more before I conquerque foreign [Music] I I would like us to uh go to the book of First Corinthians Hallelujah [Music] okay First Corinthians chapter 11 verses uh you can begin from verse the whole thing is nice let us read it from verses [Music] I think verses 3 gives the foundation he says but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of of Christ is and every man praying or prophesying having his head covered this one as his head she tells us what's the head of every man Let Me Now read verse 4. every man praying all prophesying having his head covered this one as Christ um do we understand that let us go go on together the woman that prays or prophesies with our head and covered this one as her head foreign which is her husband yeah now for that is even all one as if she were seven now there is a mystery so the Bible talks about covering and knocks out if the woman does not covering her hair the Lord is the Bible did not say the woman covering her hair foreign let that also be shown [Music] let her be covered so in other words the woman should be covered um does it mean what does it mean that does it mean a clause does it mean like what is this Muslim thing foreign foreign praise the name of the Lord to save time let's read verse 15. verse 14 first does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shamer to him [Music] but if a woman have long hair because wait the Bible says if a man has long hair or massage to him and remember the man said the head of the man is Christ if the man has long hair um but if a woman have long hair foreign [Applause] foreign for verse 5 every woman that prays to prophesies with our head uncovered this one as her hair let us explain it if a woman Cuts or trims are here the same as removing everything what should women do they should let their hair grow even nature itself but what should men do they should not let their hair growth foreign oh I need or maybe I don't have long hair yeah maybe because I want to do this Elizabeth come right run run up here um okay now so thank you everybody would you please come out okay see this these are braids you see and you know because African hair and this is cannot grow naturally without doing this is how many sisters okay you you may do this or just the hair actually this is hair only there is nothing here okay yeah but some can put us which is also all right if you want your hair to grow looks at your motive God looks at your intention why are you doing this Gucci there is another part foreign the message of the hours the Holy Spirit you're preaching with me today the message to Jesus Christ we must be one of us have taken it upon themselves to instruct their people what looks like the world and what doesn't it if I have the Holy Spirit and I see you doing certain things clearly I can see it looks like the world I will know maybe I have the Holy Spirit what's the solution the solution is it's according to him praise the name of the Lord so this is not worldly but sister can you come up here please if you could stand right here okay I mean so this is not worldly scissors all right God bless you can you come up here as well all right some sisters I want to showcase some come on yeah come come come back praise the name of the Lord it's just uh sis.com you peace come sister peace okay I mean stand

questions no she's not my wife she should look like peace peace what she wants what she's led to do is not children pray for her to receive them if you're not going to do that shut up she's a saint of God foreign foreign he's my friend he wants me to invite him again [Laughter] all right you can just say foreign [Music] okay Brother Sam stand right there [Music] according to really tell me um now at the end of the day that's according to you since [Music] Lord according to the Holy Spirit you are not the only one with the Holy Spirit is going to give us one fashion all of you removed it is and then other scriptures can apply because they don't look like the world that is big in itself how would you know what looks like the world well of course if you have the spirit of God you will know even when you see someone coming in church but you will give them Grace they are new Believers let them get deeper in Christ in 20 years he will not have this hairstyle French cut I can assure you not even because he is is now a better Christian but because he has grown he has grown birth in the Lord physical appearance as well he is no longer wanting to appease but he has more purpose in his life why a young man running away because they're taught to do things which are actually not scriptures this is the message the message represent us before Jesus Christ now you brother Solomon will not like this hairstyle but it doesn't make it wrong I hope my deacons don't dick on me after this I'm telling you because you've had this in the message for a long time no Museum does our God have a standard for them and for us in Chinese what the brother has done is very very small they will begin from here um even preachers but in China it is all right name of China they like it very much so what am I trying to say if you're not exposed you've grown in one area you begin to think if people don't do things like you then but if they do things like you know they're good foreign foreign sister mother if you have the Holy Ghost I have to tell you how to dress we have seen them come in our church win trousers but we understand they are young in the face they don't understand that is not called preaching it is called the foreign [Applause] I believe when I ask I said we have a preacher from caramela some of you were aware we're going to have someone with half clothes saying praise God what happened he's dressed better than some of you yeah Hallelujah ladies Hallelujah if you ask me pastor and you do a French cards it looks weird but you see the measure of the spirit I have is not the measure somebody else and some people he and the others because of their attitude this woman came to Jesus you know everybody knew she was a prostitute really you know many times we want we want Jesus to chase our Sinners because he wants to change them okay Jesus hears all your thoughts yes and he had what she said I think it was Peter whoever I said Peter Simone I could really think the rules are I don't know and then he began to give him a story of foreign [Music] her expression of love to Jesus [Music] even before she was transformed so you see you have a lot of people coming in church [Music] that this is a hospital and I'm concluding I'm really done preaching myself this is a hospital you know better that you have different patients at different levels of of of sickness and different levels is the only problem with you but as long as the pulpit and security is giving the right measure of the world let them come in Sinners [Applause] the world will work on them because the word and even our attitude we shouldn't always see through the glasses of judgment this word is this word is and if it wasn't for Grace you wouldn't be here let Grace do its perfect in every one of us it was wrong did you jump and someone said hey you stopped using that style all right you stopped using that stuff what happened where is this is what I want again he doesn't even know what changes don't look at him as if you're going to kill him again that's what I want and to change what God wants that is the message oh if God can do that for us see real real solid Believers hypocrisy quite frankly I'm okay with somebody who is just seated and when you're saying is [Music] doing what he's doing it let me go out when I go we're not going that God will begin but what do you think is [Applause] oh what do you want to have let him come there beaten down don't say brother now that's cool don't ever frustrate the people if they're like no don't worry leave them alone they're not fine leave them alone that's why the people who are playing Brothers pray for the ministers foreign foreign [Applause] what is see you've got on Petty issues that is not the message say that the message of there was laid the foundations I always told you that whatever I preach on the pulpits it's what I've started it's sort of seen in the words of God ever true [Music] yeah you have the words
