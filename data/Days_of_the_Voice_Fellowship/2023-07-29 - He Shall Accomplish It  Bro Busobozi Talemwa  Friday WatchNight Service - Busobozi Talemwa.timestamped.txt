[25:55] this is
[25:56] [Music]
[26:02] young people there

[26:08] I was there last Saturday Saturday two
[26:12] weekends with the one which we had a
[26:14] visit and another one where I was in
[26:16] Nairobi in a super weekend
[26:19] but when I returned they told me that I

[26:24] were about to get into Community
[26:27] they are of course as you know all
[26:31] members of that Aviation school
[26:35] but I believe God is starting something
[26:38] there
[26:39] let us just remember them in prayers
[26:42] I'll be there once again
[26:47] so actually I was informed that one or
[26:50] two I don't know the number but they're
[26:51] planning to come and join us they've
[26:53] already been joining us along foreign
[27:09] and we are reading verses 3.
[27:19] uh to six
[27:31] [Music]
[27:33] so as usual just have uh I'll just have
[27:36] a small sharing and then we will go to
[27:38] prayer
[27:41] thank you for your sacrifice to be here
[27:43] amen
[27:49] first sorry Philippians chapter 1 verses
[27:54] foreign
[28:00] so this is a poor writing today uh right
[28:04] into the Philippians
[28:10] and it says brother you need to sort
[28:12] that you need to find out what the
[28:14] problem is and get it sorted
[28:17] um
[28:19] on Fridays we usually have
[28:21] have
[28:23] uh half teams so maybe he's not the
[28:26] person
[28:29] so uh we are looking at verses three to
[28:32] six
[28:33] I thank my God upon every remembrance of
[28:37] you
[28:38] always in
[28:40] in every prayer of mine for you or
[28:43] making requests with joy
[28:47] foreign
[28:57] for your fellowship in the gospel from
[29:01] the first day until now
[29:17] being confident of this very thing that
[29:21] he which has begun a good work in you
[29:24] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[29:27] Christ
[29:29] you know
[29:31] [Music]
[29:41] so I'm speaking to you tonight on a
[29:45] thought he shall accomplish it
[29:48] is
[29:53] on verses 6 in the Amplified he says
[29:57] convinced and confident of this very
[30:00] thing
[30:01] [Music]
[30:14] [Music]
[30:17] so the problem is this one
[30:23] okay he says I'm convinced and confident
[30:26] of this very thing
[30:29] but he who has begun a good work in you
[30:34] will continue to perfect
[30:39] and complete it
[30:42] will continue to perfect and complete it
[30:45] is
[30:50] yeah that's a big trick in luganda
[30:52] perfect you will continue to perfect and
[30:55] complete it
[30:57] is
[30:59] yes until the day of Jesus Christ
[31:05] the time of his return
[31:09] so I'm talking about he shall accomplish
[31:13] it
[31:14] yeah
[31:18] that whatever God begins
[31:24] finish it it does not leave it in the
[31:27] middle
[31:29] go through with it again
[31:33] but many times we as human beings can
[31:37] begin our work
[31:39] and because of one reason or the other
[31:42] question we may not be able to
[31:45] accomplish
[31:46] so because of unforeseeable facts
[32:13] [Applause]
[32:38] and so is life
[32:40] many things in our life
[32:43] we don't get to complete many things
[32:48] you wake up one morning and say today
[32:51] I'm going to do
[32:52] ABCDEFG
[32:56] and then by evening you realize you have
[32:59] only accomplished
[33:03] and then you begin
[33:08] again I didn't accomplish it
[33:11] all right I'll do it tomorrow and there
[33:14] are many people who are very good
[33:15] procrastinators I think I want to watch
[33:19] they like pushing things
[33:22] if I fail today I'll do it tomorrow
[33:28] some of you may be are the ones looking
[33:30] at me now
[33:35] and you you are you are you have been
[33:38] culprits of that yeah
[33:40] well I will do something tomorrow
[33:43] I'll do it another day
[33:46] I will do it another day
[33:48] that very thing you've kept on pushing
[33:51] it ahead
[33:54] and you've not accomplished
[33:57] maybe you put something for two years or
[34:00] three years or four years or five years
[34:02] [Applause]
[34:04] and they've been pushing it ahead ever
[34:06] since
[34:08] foreign
[34:44] SpongeBob
[34:46] and then someone
[35:27] many times you've not come to church not
[35:30] because you could have or you were not
[35:32] it was not impossible for you to come
[35:33] and be said every single word
[35:36] because of one thing you say well I'll
[35:38] go tomorrow
[35:40] maybe you wanted to go and take the
[35:43] message to someone and then you say well
[35:45] maybe I'll talk to them tomorrow foreign
[36:34] [Music]
[37:39] we see
[37:45] foreign
[38:09] [Applause]
[38:19] foreign
[39:43] because God faulted
[40:22] don't think that when
[40:25] when the devil came in the garden
[40:28] and they lured the woman
[40:32] that God was shocked
[40:37] Gabriel
[40:38] tell me am I saying cleared
[40:43] is that the devil doing that
[40:47] Michael what should we do no that's not
[40:50] good
[40:52] that's not our God
[40:54] our God saw it before it happens
[41:01] I said when it happened
[41:03] all the angels we are shocked
[41:08] was not moved
[41:11] because he knew what would happen
[41:14] and because he knew what would happen
[41:23] accomplishes everything is
[42:46] foreign
[42:58] I was going to preach on something else
[43:00] this evening
[43:02] but the Holy Spirit as I was in the
[43:04] bathroom
[43:06] I had these words
[43:13] and I said
[43:19] quickly to put some flesh on this
[43:23] and so I'm going to you know to to share
[43:26] it and let us eat it together
[43:36] I believe God started me
[43:39] he must accomplish me
[43:42] I am a worker man the ship of God
[43:48] oh my good Lord in the book of Isaiah
[43:51] chapter 55 8. hey
[43:56] hmm he says my thoughts
[44:00] and not your thoughts
[44:05] I think about that my thoughts are not
[44:10] your thoughts
[44:16] is speaking foreign
[44:31] [Laughter]
[44:46] I can't make it
[44:49] that's not what I'm thinking
[44:51] it is very hard for me that's not what
[44:55] I'm thinking
[45:00] God says
[45:11] my way
[45:15] oh praise the name of the Lord
[45:18] our ways
[45:22] I want you to understand this many
[45:25] people they value themselves
[45:28] depending on the value people put on
[45:31] them
[45:35] if people think you were a fool our
[45:37] children you begin to feel so bad
[45:41] and they begin to feel like we're a fool
[45:47] if people think of you as a bad person
[45:52] movie you start to feel that you're bad
[45:55] and that's why we always defend
[45:57] ourselves
[46:00] when someone imagine if you're walking
[46:02] on the road
[46:03] and someone says
[46:06] sister brother be sincere
[46:09] sister brother what will be your
[46:11] reaction
[46:13] many of you will turn your face
[46:30] but that is his thoughts
[46:35] it's not the thoughts of God
[46:38] you understand amen don't think of
[46:41] yourself
[46:46] the value people put on you foreignty
[47:07] that their thoughts are not God's songs
[47:12] the thoughts of God are very different
[47:19] neither are your ways my ways
[47:22] for as the heavens are higher than the
[47:25] Earth
[47:33] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[47:38] what are your thoughts about your life
[47:42] what are your thoughts about your
[47:44] success
[47:46] what about about your success who are
[47:50] not your Victory but your success
[47:53] somebody throw the word to him if you
[47:55] get it if you don't get it just say it
[47:57] in English and let us move on your
[47:59] thoughts about your success
[48:01] you your thoughts about your children
[48:04] you see when we talk about success
[48:08] we are talking about you know moving
[48:11] from one level to another
[48:13] foreign
[48:21] according to the world
[48:22] if you are not highly educated remember
[48:25] that he was someone new you don't have a
[48:27] very good paying job
[48:32] you are you are not successful
[48:37] that's not the thoughts of God
[48:41] so the thoughts now because people think
[48:44] like that
[48:45] was about you so you begin to think the
[48:48] way they think
[48:50] and you attribute your success to what
[48:53] people think success is
[49:01] always yearning for what people think
[49:16] they decided to
[49:19] um they decided to think they decided to
[49:21] say well their success was on was on the
