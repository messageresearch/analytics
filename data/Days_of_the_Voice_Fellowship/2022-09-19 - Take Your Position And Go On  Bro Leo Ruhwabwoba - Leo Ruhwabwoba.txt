so in the seventh chapter of first one [Music] wherein he was called to aberdeen verse 21 being a servant you are not for it but if thou must be made perfect use it for road being a servant is the road is rima likewise also he that is called being free is christ is starving verse 23 you are both with the be not ye the servants are we together amen verse 24 brethren let every man wearing his cold they are in abide uganda may god add blessings to the reading of the world uh today i'm taking my sharing uh when i was invited i was wondering what i can what i should mean some cities have been [Music] the son and the daughter of god [Music] more qualities of a son and a daughter of god uh one morning when i was waiting upon the road yeah my chair came when i think and indeed he gave me this to allah and go home with a younger master already the pastor said he is started the holy spirit is telling him [Music] [Music] i always reminded [Music] [Music] amen i hope you're already blessed amen i believe that are you feeling good but it is in the world every man will move to your neighbors amen he says 10 wherein the rather brethren give the religion to make your calling and direction for if you do these things you shall never fall second peter chapter 1 verse 10 will you bear with us chapter one of us then i will get my uganda bible so that i can also elect him awareness yes are

[Music] of god by faith me i have nothing to do so i know martin is no longer there he's not interpreting although he's an interpreter interpreted for me in a conversation and he was very good so i trust he will catch up i'm very sure password of get a break i'm soon i will soon see how i can summarize yeah yeah just following one another i even know those who follow online it is not good to keep it so wrong not as though i had already attained how many people chapter three verse 12. you must feel it starting to come in habits not as though i had already attained either we are already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that will but this is one of the things i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching the force and to those things which are befalled

i've had it for about six years now to start another fellowship in adam but you see it's it's not a man that does it it's a god you know i learned this in ethiopia when the preacher preaches people so blessed they don't say we shall pray for you they don't say we shall pray for you they bless him right there and then when you never move so they stretch their hands they say god bless you so i want us to tell the pastor of god amen amen
