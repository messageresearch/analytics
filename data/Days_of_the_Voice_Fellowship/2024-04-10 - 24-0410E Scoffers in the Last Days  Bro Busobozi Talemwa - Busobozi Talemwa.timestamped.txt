[35:10] heavens were of old and the Earth
[35:12] standing out of the water and in the
[35:16] water whereby the world that then was
[35:20] being overflowed with water perished but
[35:24] the heavens and the Earth which are now

[42:58] like to tell you that the Lord is not

[43:17] there vers n the Lord is not slack
[43:21] concerning his
[43:24] promise praise the name of the Lord and
[43:27] so we see that we some of you have come

[43:50] happened many of them did not think that
[43:54] they will continue on for the next two
[43:56] or three
[44:02] before the coming of the Lord and so so
[44:05] they never encourage their people to

[44:16] school uh many Believers did not um you
[44:19] know seek after the wealth of the
[44:24] world um you know they considered those
[44:27] things to be of the
[44:29] world so they considered thatth you know
[44:32] people you know giving in marriage and
[44:34] getting married it was
[44:39] worldly and that's why even up to now
[44:42] many uh or some I would say of the of
[44:45] the pastors are biased when young people
[44:47] want to get
[44:52] married it's like as if it is a worldly
[44:56] thing
[44:57] yet for them they are
[44:59] married but you see uh it was not coming
[45:03] from a negative
[45:06] [Music]
[45:08] attitude it was coming from a positive
[45:10] spiritual
[45:13] attitude that you know the coming of the
[45:16] Lord is at
[45:17] hand and as it was in the days of Lord
[45:21] and as it was in the days of
[45:23] nor so shall it be you know when the son
[45:26] of man and we see that you know what
[45:29] were they doing then they were marrying
[45:32] and giving in marriage and trading and
[45:35] kind of
[45:36] things and so out of that the people or
[45:39] the Believers concern were concerned
[45:41] with the coming of the Lord
[45:50] only whereas the Pentecostal religion or
[45:53] the Pentecostal denomination went on the
[45:55] other direction
[46:00] you know they went on the direction that
[46:02] you know God wants to prosper you God
[46:04] wants you to be in good health and
[46:09] wealth and that you know God wants to uh
[46:12] you know bless
[46:13] you and and you know they preached
[46:17] prosperity and they they measured on
[46:21] that and indeed they have
[46:24] prospered how many can agree with me
[46:26] that they have prospered
[46:30] and so um whereas the
[46:33] Believers now feared that
[46:36] area because apparently according to
[46:40] them you know the Lord was coming very
[46:43] soon and we did not have time to go to
[46:46] make money or to go you know to pray for
[46:48] miracles or money or wealth or or or
[46:51] good life on
[46:55] Earth it was even so that for a Believer
[46:59] to drive a good car was like a
[47:06] sin for a Believer to save up money and
[47:08] you go to a hotel somewhere with your
[47:10] family for some vacational time off was
[47:15] [Music]
[47:20] hilarious those are things of the world
[47:23] and anytime Jesus is
[47:25] coming and and so believe were really
[47:28] serious and they really meant it and
[47:31] many of them now going back 50 years
[47:35] ago passed
[47:38] away and and gone to their
[47:41] reward so we we know that we are sure
[47:44] like they were waiting upon the coming
[47:46] of the Lord they preached the coming of
[47:47] the Lord and they lived the
[47:55] life and I want you to read listen to me
[47:57] carefully this
[47:59] evening they the
[48:02] life of this message that's one thing
[48:05] notable about the old time
[48:08] believers they were very sweet
[48:11] people really meant what they preached
[48:14] and they they lived it in their own
[48:17] life they had genuine
[48:19] love they belied in Holiness and
[48:22] practiced
[48:24] Holiness you know they loved each
[48:28] other you know brother you would just
[48:30] travel and a brother meet you somewhere
[48:32] you would say oh you a brother and when
[48:34] when you realize someone is a brother
[48:35] you are so so
[48:39] happy I even remember when we you know
[48:42] when I believe not many years ago about
[48:44] 18 years
[48:46] ago going on the internet and you you
[48:48] know somehow on your messenger or
[48:50] something you bump into a
[48:54] Believer and you tells you is a believer
[48:58] of the
[49:00] message and you know you also tell him
[49:02] the same you would be so happy you know
[49:05] that You' met a brother you quick sa his
[49:08] contact and you can always you know talk
[49:11] and chat and talk about the
[49:13] Lord and you know people were really
[49:15] more serious in the in the days going
[49:19] by but you see but also we had
[49:22] especially here in Africa we did not
[49:24] have the full councel of the message
[49:25] because we had bits and pieces of the
[49:27] message
[49:35] books you know you find that many
[49:39] Believers even ministers did not have
[49:41] the whole library of the message but
[49:43] what they did have they had um question
[49:46] and answers books and some Believers
[49:49] would put on quote books put quote books
[49:52] together and then they would print it as
[49:53] a
[49:55] book
[50:05] from from America they would send those
[50:07] quote
[50:08] books and believer would read those
[50:10] quote
[50:11] books and you know things like that and
[50:15] so to even we had many pastors who had
[50:17] never listened to the message of
[50:21] brother I hope now we do not have
[50:25] any we in the past put up a project of
[50:28] the message player to try and distribute
[50:29] this to pastors and
[50:37] Believers and out of that there hundreds
[50:40] of pastors and ministers who have been
[50:42] benefited out of
[50:44] that well now we have
[50:48] smartphones and we have tablets and
[50:52] ipop and so we now have the full CC of
[50:55] the message
[50:58] We Now understand the whole
[51:00] message someone cannot just come up and
[51:03] say the prophet said you can you know
[51:05] just quickly search it even while he's
[51:07] speaking it and see whether it is there
[51:08] or
[51:13] not and so preachers now are cautious
[51:16] they don't just say the the prophet
[51:20] say because they are sure that the
[51:22] people know what the prophet
[51:25] said either they know because they have
[51:28] read or they know that they can be able
[51:29] to search
[51:32] it and so because we have now understood
[51:36] the message
[51:37] more we now understood the message was
[51:40] not all about the spiritual
[51:46] things that the message was both for the
[51:49] spiritual prosperity and for the
[51:51] physical
[51:55] prosperity
[51:57] that I can come to you and preach to you
[52:00] miracles amen and we say
[52:03] amen I can come to you and preach to you
[52:05] that God is going to visit you and bless
[52:09] you so I can preach the Prosperity
[52:14] Gospel using this same message that we
[52:18] believe and I I can preach the Rapture
[52:21] and the coming of the
[52:23] Lord but now friends listen to me it has
[52:25] come to a place
[52:28] where many Believers have now you know
[52:31] come to a place where they have
[52:33] forgotten the real purpose of the
[52:40] message you know we think sometimes that
[52:42] the message is all about um you know
[52:45] some
[52:48] Revelations oh the message is God sent a
[52:52] prophet how many here believe that God
[52:54] sent a prophet
[52:57] believe we believe that God sent a
[53:00] prophet but our message is not God sent
[53:03] a
[53:05] prophet our message is more than
[53:08] that our message is more than
[53:13] God our message is the message that God
[53:16] gave to the prophet to bring to our
[53:21] generation and so to say that God sent a
[53:24] prophet is not a big revelation
[53:29] [Music]
[53:30] because we believe it and we have seen
[53:31] it in the scripture the word of
[53:34] God but there is
[53:37] more amen let us not be distracted by
[53:40] the brother I want us to just follow
[53:41] what I'm
[53:43] saying praise the name of the Lord
[53:46] there's something I'm trying to come
[53:48] to and I'm trying to drive to it I want
[53:51] your undivided
[53:55] attention brother if that thing won't
[53:57] work just forget it because I don't want
[54:00] to be interrupted this evening praise
[54:03] the name of the
[54:04] Lord something really that is burning on
[54:07] my heart to share with the
[54:12] church I just give the brother a moment
[54:14] to get done with what he's
[54:17] [Music]
[54:25] doing
[54:38] speaker I can have the
[54:40] speaker that's what you're
[54:49] to praise the
[54:55] Lord in the last
[54:59] days so now when someone asks you what
[55:02] is the
[55:04] message the message is more than deep
[55:07] Revelations of the
[55:11] word message is not is not knowledge of
[55:15] of big
[55:18] Mysteries the message is part of that
[55:20] but more than
[55:23] that are you hearing me Church message
[55:27] is not just um you know the Seven Seals
[55:30] or the church ages or you know these
[55:33] things that you can put in your
[55:35] head right now if you go to
[55:38] Google you can actually search any part
[55:40] of the message and you will find
[55:43] it and Google will tell you everything
[55:45] the message
[55:47] says but that does not mean that Google
[55:50] is
[55:55] going has all the
[55:59] message even messages that I've never
[56:02] read messages that I read and
[56:04] forgot my iPad here has
[56:07] everything but when the Rapture comes my
[56:10] iPad will be left
[56:12] behind I am actually going in the
[56:15] Rapture so then see knowledge is not
[56:18] what takes us in the
[56:21] Rapture what takes us in the
[56:24] Rapture is something more than knowledge
[56:28] what takes us in the Rapture is the life
[56:30] of this
[56:32] message and if we cannot be able to live
[56:34] the
[56:35] life then you cannot claim to be a
[56:38] believer of this
[56:40] message if you cannot leave up to the
[56:42] standards of the
[56:44] message then we cannot claim that we
[56:47] have heard or received the
[56:50] message but the Bible here now the way I
[56:53] want to approach it here is that the
[56:54] Bible speaks of scoffers
[56:59] in the last
[57:00] days we will go through this these
[57:02] Verses first of
[57:04] all knowing this that there shall come
[57:06] in the last days scoffers walking after
[57:09] their own
[57:14] lust and saying where is the promise of
[57:17] his
[57:18] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[57:21] all things continue as they were from
[57:23] the beginning of the
[57:25] creation
[57:28] so now what I want to speak about this
[57:30] evening is that we have come to a
[57:33] place where many
[57:35] Believers of this message have forgotten
[57:39] the real purpose of the
[57:43] message what is the purpose of the
[57:46] message what differentiates you from the
[57:49] Pentecostal
[57:51] [Music]
[57:52] denomination why are we not attending in
[57:55] Miracle
[57:57] why are we not not going to some of
[57:58] these good
[58:01] churches for God's sake they have good
[58:04] buildings they have more people you know
[58:08] they have more money it appears they
[58:10] have more
[58:12] blessings why don't we just close down
[58:14] our small Lighthouse and and join
[58:18] them some of us came from established
[58:22] denominations we would have become you
[58:24] know great religious leaders
[58:28] but why did we leave why did we come in
[58:31] the message why why are you in the
[58:33] message now do not forget the reason why
[58:36] you were
[58:37] here if you you were born in the message
[58:39] and you eventually believe the
[58:42] message I I should change that statement
[58:45] right
[58:45] away if you were born in a family that
[58:48] believes the
[58:50] message and you eventually believe the
[58:52] message
[58:55] yourself ask yourself why did you
[58:57] believe the
[58:59] message did you believe because there
[59:01] were no other better people that you
[59:03] could see or you know actually there are
[59:06] many people out there that are better
[59:08] than people who are in the
[59:12] message people that will help you in the
[59:16] message you can even find a brother a
[59:18] brother who cannot even help
[59:19] [Music]
[59:21] you but how dare you find people who are
[59:24] doing great charitable work
[59:29] and many Believers don't even want to
[59:31] think about charity
[59:33] anymore and yet the Bible says that
[59:35] charity is true
[59:39] religion is that right
[59:41] church so what I'm trying to say is the
[59:45] why we are in the message is not because
[59:48] we have better people
[59:49] here it's not because we have more money
[59:52] here it's not because you know here you
[59:55] are going to find you know more perfect
[59:59] individuals that our Revelations are
[1:00:02] more better and it makes us more
[1:00:06] happy but we came in the message because
[1:00:10] we found that it was bitter
[1:00:14] HS which was going to give us a desired
[1:00:20] goal our desired goal is the
[1:00:23] rapture our desired goal is a aining the
[1:00:27] promise we have been given a
[1:00:30] promise the reason why Jesus came on
[1:00:32] Earth and he
[1:00:33] died the reason why he died and he rose
[1:00:37] again so that we might also die and rise
[1:00:40] again like he died and rose
[1:00:44] again amen we believe the message so we
[1:00:46] might attain the
[1:00:50] Resurrection The main thing in the
[1:00:52] message is the
[1:00:54] rapture is just detailed
[1:00:59] information and if you are not prepared
[1:01:01] for the Rapture every day of your
[1:01:05] life then you've not found the
[1:01:07] message if you feel whenever you come to
[1:01:10] church you don't come closer to the to
[1:01:12] the
[1:01:14] Lord if your life does not
[1:01:17] change amen if you cannot come to that
[1:01:19] place why you say well I'm am
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:24] blameless
[1:01:26] spotless then you've not come in the
[1:01:29] message the message is a and the thing
[1:01:32] to make you
[1:01:33] spotless the mess is to make you
[1:01:37] blameless by faith because when you
[1:01:40] believe you receive the power to
[1:01:43] be when you believe you receive the
[1:01:46] power to become what you were not able
[1:01:49] to
[1:01:51] become amen and the promise that God
[1:01:54] gave promise of his coming because when
[1:01:58] he was on Earth he said I go but I shall
[1:02:01] come back and amen take you to myself so
[1:02:06] we believe he's coming
[1:02:07] again amen it's not a myth it is not a
[1:02:11] story it is a reality Jesus is coming
[1:02:15] back
[1:02:15] again Jesus is coming back again
[1:02:19] preachers no longer want to talk
[1:02:21] about but let me tell you this message
[1:02:25] is all about
[1:02:27] this message is all about the second
[1:02:29] coming of Jesus
[1:02:31] Christ that's what the seal is about
[1:02:35] that's what the church is about that's
[1:02:37] what the weeks of Daniel about that's
[1:02:40] what every Revelation in the Bible is
[1:02:43] about is about the bride who came from
[1:02:48] eternity going back to
[1:02:50] Eternity that's what it's all about and
[1:02:53] the coming of Jesus only to prepare you
[1:02:57] and
[1:02:58] me for that going
[1:03:00] away for that catching
[1:03:03] away but because it has taken so many
[1:03:07] years since the prophet came and
[1:03:11] went in the first few
[1:03:13] years people didn't even want to go to
[1:03:16] school why the Rapture is going to
[1:03:18] happen any
[1:03:19] time people didn't even want to get
[1:03:22] married oh because they wanted to marry
[1:03:24] so fast
[1:03:27] why because the r
[1:03:31] com you know people didn't want to
[1:03:34] work why the rupt is coming
[1:03:38] soon they would look down on people who
[1:03:40] have something in in this
[1:03:42] life and tell them brother you are
[1:03:44] leaving all these things
[1:03:46] here you better share it with
[1:03:49] everyone and when you go in the book of
[1:03:52] Acts what do you find in the book of
[1:03:54] Acts you know Believers th all their
[1:03:59] wealth and they shared it equally among
[1:04:03] themselves have you ever read that in
[1:04:05] the
[1:04:06] Bible if you haven't go back and read
[1:04:09] it that's what they did in the first
[1:04:11] church and so
[1:04:13] Believers 20 30 40 years
[1:04:16] ago they were almost like
[1:04:19] that they were so together love was so
[1:04:23] real because they believed that Jesus is
[1:04:25] coming back
[1:04:27] again even Paul himself the angel
[1:04:30] messenger of the first
[1:04:32] church he died believing Jesus is coming
[1:04:35] in his
[1:04:36] generation because he said we which are
[1:04:39] alive and
[1:04:41] remain so every believer that has ever
[1:04:43] lived before
[1:04:45] us they lived without
[1:04:48] conscience that Jesus is coming anytime
[1:04:52] soon amen they would go to pray and
[1:04:54] fasting
[1:04:56] they would go to reading the
[1:04:57] word they always wanted to live
[1:05:00] holy they always wanted their mind to be
[1:05:03] focused on the word of
[1:05:06] God even when they sinned in their
[1:05:09] imagination they would go and fast and
[1:05:11] pray for
[1:05:12] that God take
[1:05:15] away oh God fill me with the
[1:05:18] power but what is happening in our own
[1:05:21] generation Believers have forgotten the
[1:05:24] real reason why they are believers
[1:05:27] you find Believers no longer
[1:05:29] pray Believers eat and eat and
[1:05:33] eat Believers no longer fast even
[1:05:37] Believers even in church when we preach
[1:05:40] about the coming of the Lord they begin
[1:05:42] doing they begin getting B because they
[1:05:45] they have forgotten the reason why we
[1:05:48] are
[1:05:49] believer when you find Believers are
[1:05:52] playing around with
[1:05:54] sin imagine believer playing around with
[1:05:57] s going around and behaving like
[1:06:00] others and you come in church and you're
[1:06:04] conforted you know it used to be in the
[1:06:06] past that someone was a Believer or they
[1:06:09] were
[1:06:10] not and even when a brother did
[1:06:14] something and I know I've spoken against
[1:06:18] that I know and and you know the Deon
[1:06:21] needs to help me on that young lady she
[1:06:22] she doesn't need to go out now
[1:06:24] listen
[1:06:26] praise the name of the Lord I've spoken
[1:06:28] against
[1:06:30] this but they were doing it for a
[1:06:34] reason when a Believer
[1:06:39] would they would immediately arrest him
[1:06:43] arrest him bring them before the church
[1:06:46] confess what you have
[1:06:49] done it was the wrong way of doing
[1:06:52] [Music]
[1:06:53] it but there were filled with
[1:06:57] passion to keep the message and the word
[1:07:02] holy to keep the word right to keep
[1:07:05] themselves right because they did not
[1:07:08] want no a before
[1:07:11] them you know when a is in the
[1:07:14] camp the glory of God
[1:07:18] departs are you hearing me chch they
[1:07:21] wanted to be right with God they wanted
[1:07:23] to stand right with God
[1:07:26] and but what we find today we find a lot
[1:07:29] of
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:33] Hypocrites why we have
[1:07:37] forgotten we have forgotten the reason
[1:07:39] why we are
[1:07:41] beli we are believers because we are
[1:07:44] meant to be
[1:07:46] special we are meant to hold the
[1:07:49] standard too
[1:07:51] high higher than
[1:07:54] thein
[1:07:56] you know what amen what what Jesus said
[1:08:00] to the disciples he said if you are
[1:08:04] righteous if your Holiness will not go
[1:08:07] beyond that of the of the religious
[1:08:12] people yeah if it do not go
[1:08:15] beyond that of who are
[1:08:21] they if it is not beyond
[1:08:24] that now that you not even started
[1:08:28] yet who are the Pharisees of today they
[1:08:31] the religious people the church
[1:08:34] people the Pentecostal
[1:08:37] denominations angan denominations
[1:08:40] Catholic denominations theti
[1:08:42] denominations all these they our
[1:08:45] religious
[1:08:48] phes and if you who claim to believe
[1:08:51] this end
[1:08:53] message if your faith does not go beyond
[1:08:56] if your life does not is not better or
[1:08:58] Beyond
[1:09:01] theirs you can't call yourself a
[1:09:05] Believer you must be in a place where
[1:09:08] amen you are the standard
[1:09:12] today listen to me I believe with all my
[1:09:16] heart that the True Believers of this
[1:09:19] message are filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:23] amen must be the standard
[1:09:27] today because what is the standard the
[1:09:30] standard is Christ and where is Christ
[1:09:34] Christ is in his own world and in every
[1:09:37] generation Christ is revealed in his own
[1:09:41] word because it's the word of the
[1:09:44] hour and the word of the hour today has
[1:09:47] come through the lips of our
[1:09:49] Prophet to prepare us for the coming of
[1:09:53] the Lord there is a group of people that
[1:09:57] are being prepared for the coming of the
[1:10:00] Lord every day they're being
[1:10:02] shed every being
[1:10:05] sh the world is being cut away from them
[1:10:09] every day we are coming
[1:10:11] Clos Jesus so now it must come to a
[1:10:15] place when we walk out into the
[1:10:18] world the world will not see me the
[1:10:22] world will see
[1:10:23] Christ I must be D
[1:10:26] standard you must be the standard and if
[1:10:29] you are not then you are joining the
[1:10:33] scoffers the Bible says there will be
[1:10:37] scoffers in the last days who are the
[1:10:40] scof the SCS are those who know the
[1:10:45] truth but they
[1:10:47] believe
[1:10:50] alive they know that Jesus is to come
[1:10:53] back
[1:10:54] again but because it takes so
[1:10:57] long they reach a place and
[1:11:00] say since my great grandfather how many
[1:11:03] years 40
[1:11:07] no things have been the same way ever
[1:11:11] since is Jesus really coming back again
[1:11:14] let me tell you if you believe that
[1:11:15] Jesus is coming back
[1:11:18] again you are life will
[1:11:20] testify but if your life is doing
[1:11:22] something
[1:11:24] different then you don't believe
[1:11:26] it well you know it but you don't
[1:11:29] believe it but if you believe Jesus is
[1:11:32] coming back
[1:11:33] again every hour of your life every day
[1:11:36] of your life you are going to live
[1:11:39] conscious
[1:11:41] of you're going to live believing and
[1:11:45] knowing any time Jesus will come anytime
[1:11:49] Jesus is coming am I ready for his
[1:11:53] coming am I ready for his coming
[1:11:56] if if he should come now are you ready
[1:11:59] for his
[1:12:00] coming if you are not
[1:12:02] ready
[1:12:04] then you need to be
[1:12:09] ready the Bible says for this they
[1:12:12] willingly are ignorant
[1:12:16] of they
[1:12:17] willingly they ignorant of it
[1:12:21] willingly that by the word of God the
[1:12:24] heavens were of all and the Earth
[1:12:25] standing out of the water and in the
[1:12:27] water whereby the world that then was
[1:12:30] being overflowed with water perished
[1:12:38] amen but the heavens and the Earth which
[1:12:40] are
[1:12:42] now by the same word are kept
[1:12:46] inore reserved
[1:12:49] reserved what are they reserved
[1:12:53] to it is reserved unto
[1:12:57] fire against the day of
[1:13:00] judgment so fire is
[1:13:06] coming these things have been going
[1:13:08] through my mind you know the Hall
[1:13:10] of this past week and a few
[1:13:14] days Believers we leaving as if we do
[1:13:17] not believe that the coming of the Lord
[1:13:18] is
[1:13:22] real fire is coming
[1:13:27] we're not even talking about Hell Fire
[1:13:28] here we're talking about the fire that
[1:13:30] is going to come and burn this
[1:13:35] world it will burn all the
[1:13:38] proud read your Bible Mal 3 it will burn
[1:13:41] all the
[1:13:44] proud it will burn all that do
[1:13:47] wickedly it will burn them up the
[1:13:50] Lord fire is coming this Earth is
[1:13:52] reserved to the to fire
[1:13:56] is reserved un the fire against the day
[1:13:58] of judgment and pedition of ungodly
[1:14:02] men and that's why before that
[1:14:06] happens God because of his
[1:14:09] love sent end time
[1:14:13] message what is the end time
[1:14:15] message it is a message of
[1:14:19] preparation a preparing
[1:14:21] us preparing us for the coming of the
[1:14:24] Lord
[1:14:26] preparing us to be saved from the
[1:14:28] fires preparing us from the fires that
[1:14:31] are coming down preparing us from the
[1:14:34] judgments of
[1:14:35] God and if you are not ready you will
[1:14:38] not go and if you hear this message and
[1:14:42] you live the life of this message you
[1:14:45] are going to be made
[1:14:47] ready the Bible in the Book of
[1:14:49] Revelation chter 19 I
[1:14:52] believe amen he says the bride has made
[1:14:55] our
[1:14:56] ready the bride is ready we are ready by
[1:15:00] the
[1:15:01] word we are ready by the revealed word

[1:15:13] family ready make your children ready

[1:15:30] time

[1:15:33] young men to be serious
[1:15:36] God means to forsake everything
[1:15:40] else do it be on fire for God because to
[1:15:44] be on fire for God is a decision you
[1:15:48] make to be on fire for God a choice you
[1:15:52] take there is no power
[1:15:55] in Hell or in Heaven Can hinder you from
[1:15:58] doing that because the price has already
[1:16:01] been
[1:16:02] paid whoever wants to drink
[1:16:05] of can come and drink whoever wants the
[1:16:09] Holy Ghost can come and drink I believe
[1:16:12] this is the time if there was any

[1:16:16] be this is the time to
[1:16:19] shout
[1:16:20] pray time to because I tell you people
[1:16:24] who go to the
[1:16:26] they go praying they go shouting they go
[1:16:31] ning when the door was

[1:16:36] are praying shouting nashing the
[1:16:39] teeth let me tell you because time was
[1:16:42] over but now is the time for us to
[1:16:46] pray and do whatever we need to
[1:16:49] do right with
[1:16:52] God because if we don't we may have
[1:16:55] another
[1:16:58] opportunity praise the name of the
[1:17:00] Lord the message is all about the coming
[1:17:02] of the
[1:17:04] lord it's not our E I
[1:17:07] understand it is by his grace but you
[1:17:11] see what his grace does his grace
[1:17:14] doesn't take you into
[1:17:18] disgrace his grace makes you to
[1:17:22] fear his grace brings you to a place of
[1:17:27] surrender his grace brings you the
[1:17:31] realization brings you
[1:17:34] Revelation brings you understanding amen
[1:17:37] brings you you know his Spirit as long
[1:17:40] as you open your
[1:17:41] heart that's what his grace
[1:17:46] does and he continues on to
[1:17:49] say but beloved be uh not ignorant of
[1:17:52] this one thing
[1:17:56] that one day is with the Lord as
[1:17:57] thousand years and thousand years as one
[1:18:03] day the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:18:09] promise when you talk about
[1:18:12] SC now in the
[1:18:16] Greek the word is called
[1:18:22] empac which is to mean a the
[1:18:26] writer that is by implication a false
[1:18:32] teacher a
[1:18:35] moer one that expresses
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:40] contempt contempt for what you
[1:18:43] believe contempt for what you stand
[1:18:46] for one that ridicules what you
[1:18:53] believe laugh at it scones at
[1:18:57] it you know at
[1:19:02] it you know joking jokes about
[1:19:06] it teases you for what you
[1:19:10] believe the Bible says there will be
[1:19:12] these people who are scers in the
[1:19:16] last we are going to have many people
[1:19:18] who ridicule us for what we
[1:19:20] stand people are going to mock us for
[1:19:22] what
[1:19:23] we
[1:19:25] you know people who are going to Jer at
[1:19:27] us or you know joke at with us and tease
[1:19:33] us call at us but I'll tell you why they
[1:19:37] do that because they do not recognize
[1:19:41] the their day and the
[1:19:44] message and for anyone who knowing what
[1:19:47] the Bible and the word of God
[1:19:51] says goes and does something will
[1:19:57] actually trying to SC at the
[1:20:02] word and that's why the Bible actually
[1:20:05] says that having received the
[1:20:09] light having receiv received the
[1:20:11] revelation of the word having received
[1:20:14] the mystery of the word and being rece
[1:20:18] enlightened and then you fall
[1:20:21] away you SC at it said two things
[1:20:26] one he said that you are taking Jesus
[1:20:29] Christ again on the
[1:20:32] cross and he says you're putting him to
[1:20:34] open
[1:20:36] shame number two he says they shall
[1:20:39] never be
[1:20:40] forgiven meaning they they cannot be
[1:20:46] restored gained
[1:20:50] repentance you can inter that
[1:20:53] scripture
[1:20:55] that's all right you can interpret it
[1:20:57] your way I just parhas it for
[1:21:01] you what does it show the Bible speaks
[1:21:04] about the
[1:21:06] scoffers those that will scof the
[1:21:08] word when you know what the word
[1:21:11] says but then you you laugh at it you
[1:21:15] joke about it you tease others who
[1:21:18] believe
[1:21:19] it you ridic
[1:21:23] them
[1:21:26] listen
[1:21:27] carefully 1964 recognizing your day and
[1:21:30] its
[1:21:33] message and also the Simplicity of the
[1:21:36] message and the
[1:21:39] messenger Noah wasn't
[1:21:42] scientific he wasn't uneducated
[1:21:45] man he was a poor
[1:21:47] farmer humble with a simple
[1:21:50] message it was too simple for their High
[1:21:53] Learning
[1:21:56] this message is too
[1:21:58] simple so it is so is it
[1:22:02] today God always makes it
[1:22:05] simple to get the people who will
[1:22:08] believe and trust
[1:22:11] him God is not looking for people who
[1:22:13] can
[1:22:15] reason God is looking for people who are
[1:22:18] simple and who will believe the
[1:22:21] word and who will trust God and take him
[1:22:25] at his
[1:22:26] word it's a different just a simple
[1:22:29] message a different message it
[1:22:32] says but the same
[1:22:35] God now I want you to believe it and
[1:22:38] understand that God has
[1:22:40] spoken Jesus said they sced at his
[1:22:45] Prophet they sced that no his prophet
[1:22:49] and as they scoffed in that
[1:22:51] day so will they do it again is
[1:22:57] coming God has sent a prophet to
[1:23:00] us and people have scoffed at him you go
[1:23:04] all over the Internet we have had
[1:23:06] preachers who have come and sced at
[1:23:10] William because of what he
[1:23:15] T they could not find one
[1:23:18] thing in
[1:23:21] his
[1:23:23] on they could not say he committed
[1:23:26] doubt they could not say he he he begged
[1:23:30] for
[1:23:31] money or he stole money they could not
[1:23:34] say you know he preached you know he
[1:23:37] lived a wrong kind of
[1:23:40] Life they could not say that do you know
[1:23:43] why because the God that was in him
[1:23:48] enabled him to live the
[1:23:51] life even with all the possibility
[1:23:56] of him taking the
[1:23:58] money William would have bued one of the
[1:24:01] biggest religious
[1:24:06] organizations the 19th
[1:24:09] century if he had taken the direction of
[1:24:12] many
[1:24:15] preachers but he knew his
[1:24:17] calling others became Rich because of
[1:24:21] you but he refused the riches
[1:24:27] because he knew if he gets the riches
[1:24:30] they will divert his
[1:24:32] anation from his God cold
[1:24:36] mission they gave him a very beautiful
[1:24:38] car he said how can I drive
[1:24:41] it and go preach to you know a sick
[1:24:45] woman or a very old poor
[1:24:50] woman how can I do that and he packed it
[1:24:53] away in his
[1:24:58] one man brought a check of I don't
[1:25:00] remember how much it was 2 million or
[1:25:01] something
[1:25:10] like yes
[1:25:13] 196 that's a lot of
[1:25:16] money today a lot of
[1:25:19] money they brought it to
[1:25:21] him gave it to him he refused
[1:25:26] it and the man decided to come again in
[1:25:28] the prayer
[1:25:31] L as if he was going to be prayed
[1:25:35] for and he gave him the
[1:25:37] check said I told
[1:25:45] Brother which preer could do
[1:25:51] that and those same preachers
[1:25:55] who are stealing money from
[1:25:57] people and they buying private
[1:26:00] jets standing up on
[1:26:02] their saying was
[1:26:06] a they
[1:26:09] scoffers don't stoop down to their
[1:26:13] level don't be
[1:26:16] deceived who is a liar they are the
[1:26:20] Liars that he went wrong when you ask
[1:26:23] them where did he
[1:26:25] they will tell you oh because he
[1:26:26] preached this he preached
[1:26:28] that it is because the message was
[1:26:32] different the message was so
[1:26:35] simple that the high minded could not
[1:26:38] receive
[1:26:41] it could
[1:26:45] not I saw a preacher here
[1:26:48] in and he said oh you know I met one of
[1:26:52] my daughters
[1:26:55] and she told me she's now going to
[1:26:56] another
[1:26:58] church and I found her looking
[1:27:02] bad looking so bad and I asked her why
[1:27:06] you she said uh you know in our new
[1:27:10] church we don't wear
[1:27:12] earrings we don't use
[1:27:15] makeup we don't dress you know in
[1:27:20] those and then this pastor told her
[1:27:26] all these
[1:27:29] people they going to run mad with
[1:27:34] Jesus and then he told the people they
[1:27:37] would be
[1:27:38] surprised to find to find us in
[1:27:42] heaven when we're using our
[1:27:45] makeup and all the women with those long
[1:27:49] nails like a
[1:27:51] c
[1:27:53] and make up on
[1:27:55] their you heard them shout
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:27:59] [Applause]
[1:28:02] after what are they doing they are
[1:28:06] scers they are scorning at the
[1:28:09] word it's not a church doctrine it is a
[1:28:13] world best
[1:28:15] teaching and any Pastor who want preach
[1:28:19] it he has no backbone for the
[1:28:23] world I tell you if you're going to be
[1:28:25] in a
[1:28:26] heaven it will be another
[1:28:28] Heaven not my heaven where I am going
[1:28:32] noten where
[1:28:34] went where
[1:28:37] went where
[1:28:39] went were Godly
[1:28:41] women it will be a heaven where where
[1:28:44] Jezebel
[1:28:47] went the heaven where the saints of God
[1:28:52] went there won't be any unclean thing
[1:28:56] there there won't be any worldl
[1:28:59] there there won't be
[1:29:02] fornicators there won't
[1:29:04] be amen there won't be
[1:29:08] immorality and the Bible say all the
[1:29:11] immortal they have their place in the
[1:29:14] Lake of Fire by the heaven where I am
[1:29:17] going amen only the holy will
[1:29:20] walk holy without SP without rink
[1:29:24] washed in the
[1:29:26] blood we were like them but when we came
[1:29:30] the blood the blood which is the word
[1:29:33] changed us when we baptized with the
[1:29:36] Holy
[1:29:37] Ghost bur away all
[1:29:43] uncleanness and that's why that's why we
[1:29:46] can boldly say we are going to
[1:29:51] heaven hallelujah hallelujah amen not
[1:29:54] our
[1:29:54] Holiness his
[1:29:56] Holiness what is his Holiness his
[1:30:00] Holiness is the word of
[1:30:02] God not your church
[1:30:04] teachings not your pastor
[1:30:06] sen it is the word of
[1:30:09] God the word of God is the Holiness of
[1:30:12] God the Bible says our own Holiness our
[1:30:15] own of
[1:30:17] rightness they are filthy
[1:30:20] rugs but his word gives us his holy
[1:30:26] hallu praise God it's a different
[1:30:30] message it's the same God but I want you
[1:30:33] to believe it and understand that God
[1:30:36] has said
[1:30:37] it Jesus said the SC that his
[1:30:41] Prophet Noah as they sced in that day so
[1:30:46] will they do it again at his
[1:30:48] com they would do the same thing that's
[1:30:51] the reason that Pharaoh drowned in the
[1:30:53] sea
[1:30:56] why did Pharaoh drown in the
[1:30:58] sea he never recognized his
[1:31:02] day this is not the day of
[1:31:05] men this is not the day of churches this
[1:31:09] is not the day of denominations this is
[1:31:11] not the day of is this is the day where
[1:31:15] God is calling
[1:31:16] his sending his message say come out of
[1:31:21] her my
[1:31:22] people do not partakers of
[1:31:26] our this is this day we are living
[1:31:29] in praise God and never recogniz his
[1:31:34] day today they can't recognize the day
[1:31:36] we
[1:31:37] living he never recognized what was
[1:31:40] going
[1:31:41] on he was too hook up in the
[1:31:43] achievements of his scientific
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:48] age to build
[1:31:50] cities with slave
[1:31:52] labor too busy to recognize the
[1:31:56] opportunity that he
[1:31:57] had and he turned God his Prophet
[1:32:01] messenger he turned him out into the
[1:32:07] Wilderness my good
[1:32:09] Lord God help us this is what the
[1:32:12] denominations are doing
[1:32:14] today they taking God his Prophet
[1:32:18] messenger by the way William Bram
[1:32:20] William Bram is not our Prophet only
[1:32:24] is a prophet of a whole
[1:32:27] Generation all this
[1:32:31] generation let me tell you if you did
[1:32:34] not
[1:32:35] know since the second world
[1:32:38] war there was no
[1:32:41] Revival until came on
[1:32:44] the that's when when we had a worldwide
[1:32:52] charismatic there is no powerful
[1:32:54] preacher
[1:32:56] today that has not either
[1:32:59] read or
[1:33:00] listened some or all of the messages of
[1:33:05] brother but what have they done they
[1:33:08] turn him into the
[1:33:10] Wilderness they trash it
[1:33:13] away we have one of our prominent
[1:33:15] preacher here in
[1:33:18] Cala I don't like mentioning
[1:33:21] names but I'm being tempted right now
[1:33:25] and some of us saw him and we knew he
[1:33:30] had been following brother
[1:33:33] brother we we we had been
[1:33:35] seeing but I had never mentioned
[1:33:39] brother until one day
[1:33:43] shamelessly he came out and said William
[1:33:46] Will man of God oh yes he was oh the way
[1:33:51] he was talking about you was not someone
[1:33:54] who heard about
[1:33:57] him was someone who had read and
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:04] started so they
[1:34:06] know don't be deceived they
[1:34:09] know I say they
[1:34:11] know but what do they do they trash this
[1:34:15] message with his message Into the
[1:34:19] Wilderness but who is in the
[1:34:21] wilderness people in the wildness

[1:35:00] wi that is something
[1:35:03] coming amen there is a
[1:35:05] Rapture there is the promised
[1:35:08] land after the wildness but don't you

[1:35:14] the P of fire is right here with
[1:35:18] us God is with us and even if they claim
[1:35:23] the messages
[1:35:25] they can't debate with the
[1:35:29] light they can't debate with the
[1:35:33] life they can't debate with the life we
[1:35:37] are
[1:35:38] living let me tell the devil has
[1:35:41] ideas the devil can preach the devil can
[1:35:44] talk the devil can preach everything
[1:35:47] I'm Hallelujah but the devil has no
[1:35:51] power to live the life of the world
[1:35:55] and only in the message you are going to
[1:35:58] find
[1:35:59] people Souls Believers and preachers
[1:36:03] life are going to live the life of the
[1:36:08] world and when these false
[1:36:11] preachers begin to talk against the
[1:36:14] message just wash their
[1:36:16] lives Jesus said You shall know them by
[1:36:19] their

[1:36:59] did he never recognized it if you would
[1:37:02] have only recognized the promised word
[1:37:04] of
[1:37:06] God and if the churches

[1:37:11] recognize if the churches would only
[1:37:13] recognize the word of
[1:37:15] God made his This Promise for this
[1:37:21] hour this hour

[1:46:44] going to meet them at this precious
[1:46:47] message which we are preaching to you
[1:46:50] today men have given their life for
[1:46:54] and you you are here playing
[1:46:56] with how can you stand with
[1:46:59] them how you are a joker you cannot you
[1:47:04] need to come to a place of to
[1:47:08] surrender and Lord fill me

[1:47:32] L kill my
[1:47:34] ideas I want to be born again by the
[1:47:37] power of the Holy
[1:47:39] Ghost it is now our
[1:47:42] day it is our
[1:47:45] time a prophet was promised to come with
[1:47:48] a message to the
[1:47:51] bride has he
[1:47:54] come he has come and gone so this would
[1:47:57] be a Rapture
[1:47:59] message we have received it those who
[1:48:02] would receive
[1:48:03] it will not be
[1:48:08] scoffers they will become living
[1:48:11] a we are the
[1:48:13] people in the last days that are not
[1:48:17] going to be
[1:48:18] scoffers but there are others who will
[1:48:21] scoff at what
[1:48:27] give me 15 more minutes or
[1:48:29] so book ofans
[1:48:32] 1:9 the Bible says the thing has
[1:48:36] been it is that which shall be and that
[1:48:39] which is done is that which shall be
[1:48:42] done there is no new thing under the
[1:48:46] Sun so now if we're talking about the
[1:48:49] end the end is again coming
[1:48:54] we had the end but there was a time when
[1:48:57] there was a
[1:48:59] end days of Noah that was an end but we
[1:49:04] are at another
[1:49:06] end let us talk about the days of
[1:49:09] no in the message hearing recognizing
[1:49:12] and acting on the word of
[1:49:16] God don't just
[1:49:18] he recognize it don't just recognize it
[1:49:22] act upon
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:26] it now see it has to be quickened to
[1:49:30] you I couldn't imagine Noah
[1:49:33] saying you know what it just must
[1:49:37] be rain
[1:49:40] someday so I would just go out and build
[1:49:43] me an
[1:49:45] ark if it rains well get in the and move
[1:49:49] right
[1:49:50] away and nothing will bother me
[1:49:53] because I'm going to get in the
[1:49:55] AR could you
[1:49:57] imagine no speaking like
[1:50:00] that no that wasn't
[1:50:03] it may the elected hear it
[1:50:09] now if that would have been
[1:50:12] it the first scoffer come
[1:50:16] by if Noah had done
[1:50:19] that the first cers would have come back
[1:50:25] as the Bible said there
[1:50:27] were they SC at him he would have laid
[1:50:31] his armor
[1:50:32] down and walked
[1:50:35] away are you hearing
[1:50:38] me no he wasn't doing this wish
[1:50:43] worship he was sure about what he was
[1:50:47] doing he was sure what he had he was
[1:50:51] convinced he was
[1:50:54] concerned I have to get this act
[1:50:57] done because is the promise of
[1:50:59] God God will not be
[1:51:02] slack concerning his
[1:51:04] promise if he said is going to
[1:51:07] rain it's going to rain and I tell you
[1:51:11] in our day we have said fire is coming
[1:51:17] down and that is going to
[1:51:21] happen
[1:51:23] if you don't like what I'm
[1:51:24] saying take it up with
[1:51:28] God that's what he's saying I'm just
[1:51:31] saying what he
[1:51:32] say like men does
[1:51:36] today that starts out with
[1:51:38] Jesus when they look over and see the
[1:51:42] truth they back away from it they can't
[1:51:45] stand
[1:51:47] it like that noted evangelist
[1:51:50] said I it will tear up my
[1:51:54] Ministry one brother told me actually
[1:51:56] that one of the prominent Pentecostal
[1:51:58] preachers here in the
[1:52:01] country one say this message is the
[1:52:04] truth but if I preach
[1:52:07] it I won't have a
[1:52:10] Ministry meaning people will not
[1:52:13] come these people are not after
[1:52:16] Souls they are after
[1:52:19] money they are after Their Kingdoms
[1:52:23] friends we didn't start the preaching
[1:52:25] vocation because of
[1:52:28] money you see if God wants me to be a
[1:52:32] poor man all my
[1:52:34] life I'm
[1:52:37] satisfied if he wants to me to make if
[1:52:39] you wants to make me the richest
[1:52:41] that I'll be satisfied it's all up to
[1:52:44] him I live for him I don't leave for
[1:52:48] myself I don't even leave for my
[1:52:50] children my wife I live for him you
[1:52:54] should live for
[1:52:56] him everything else you have is because
[1:52:59] of
[1:53:01] him you see that's the difference and
[1:53:04] this man came up and he said this will
[1:53:05] tear up my
[1:53:07] Ministry I don't care for a
[1:53:10] Ministry that the Holy Ghost would tear
[1:53:16] up that I don't care for a Ministry that
[1:53:18] the Holy Ghost would tear
[1:53:21] up
[1:53:23] yes because this word is the Holy Ghost
[1:53:26] word so if you fear to preach it say
[1:53:30] because I'm going to preach against
[1:53:31] women wearing
[1:53:35] trousers I won't preach it because women
[1:53:38] will
[1:53:39] live brother sister no no no no sisters
[1:53:43] if you want to live
[1:53:45] live those sisters who believe it they
[1:53:48] will
[1:53:50] stay we don't let me give me more sound
[1:53:53] we don't believe in women wearing
[1:53:58] trousers it is a spirit of
[1:54:04] Jezebel
[1:54:06] yes come
[1:54:08] on no it is the
[1:54:12] wordy
[1:54:14] 22 a woman will not wear that which
[1:54:18] pertains to a
[1:54:20] man or man will not wear that
[1:54:25] neither a man a
[1:54:27] woman
[1:54:30] parhas go back and read it you find out
[1:54:34] that there isas a woman is gar and a man
[1:54:37] is gar and it is different and a trouser
[1:54:42] is a man's garment that is why even when
[1:54:46] you go in the public
[1:54:48] toilet even if you're a woman wearing a
[1:54:51] trouser you are
[1:54:53] conscious will tell you that is a man
[1:54:56] don't go
[1:54:59] there but the devil has attacked the
[1:55:02] women of Our
[1:55:03] Generation and he has blinded them and
[1:55:07] has burned their
[1:55:08] conscience that even their conscious
[1:55:10] can't
[1:55:12] teach you see that's why you have women
[1:55:15] taking over
[1:55:17] pulpits women preaching and teaching and
[1:55:21] because pastor's wife or pastor's
[1:55:24] daughter then you are a preacher where
[1:55:27] you may have a gift to
[1:55:29] preach if you have it
[1:55:31] sister come on in we shall ask you to
[1:55:35] preach to our Sunday
[1:55:37] school oh yes that is all right but as
[1:55:41] far as the Bible is concerned a woman
[1:55:44] should not be a teacher oring authority
[1:55:47] over
[1:55:50] men but she can teach
[1:55:54] and as well as she the older women can
[1:55:56] teach younger
[1:55:59] women it is in the book of
[1:56:01] Titus what will the older women
[1:56:03] teach they will teach younger
[1:56:06] women how to love their
[1:56:09] husbands how to be amen keepers at
[1:56:12] home older sisters teach these younger
[1:56:16] sisters how to be real
[1:56:19] mothers how to keep at home not to go
[1:56:22] here and
[1:56:24] there the Bible says it is not me to
[1:56:27] preach it even the older women to preach
[1:56:29] theer
[1:56:32] sister how to love their
[1:56:34] children which means even women need to
[1:56:37] be taught how to love their
[1:56:40] children the way of the
[1:56:43] word so sister young
[1:56:46] sister when you begin calling your
[1:56:50] children and the older mother comes to
[1:56:52] you and says don't you ever use that
[1:56:56] language don't be
[1:56:58] offended the Bible tells us to do
[1:57:01] that to teach your younger sister how to
[1:57:05] love your children how to obey your
[1:57:07] husband how a keep at it is the word of
[1:57:11] God if you don't like it it's not up to
[1:57:17] me what do we have we have a generation
[1:57:21] of people who don't like to hear those
[1:57:23] things it will tear my Ministry any
[1:57:27] Ministry that all that will be teared by
[1:57:29] the Holy
[1:57:31] Ghost it ought to be
[1:57:35] teared it ought to be
[1:57:38] tear but see it is pride so much man so
[1:57:43] much
[1:57:46] person Noah was out in the
[1:57:49] field and he heard and he recognized
[1:57:53] and he
[1:57:55] acted no matter how many scoffers
[1:57:59] come he buil right
[1:58:01] away oh praise God so we here at dvf
[1:58:06] know what we are
