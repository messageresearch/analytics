[1:21:47] our strength amen
[1:21:53] so you can't believe when you see my
[1:21:55] Mama
[1:21:57] she's younger than you even Mama
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:05] because
[1:22:08] because he fulfills always
[1:22:11] if you see my dad
[1:22:16] his people calls him our brother so uh I
[1:22:21] think those are one of the benefits of
[1:22:23] believing
[1:22:28] amen amen
[1:22:30] because that is the word also Amina amen
[1:22:34] so I receive greetings from our church
[1:22:36] also foreign
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:50] uh

[1:23:04] yeah
[1:23:10] I'm Western Uganda
[1:23:12] India yeah
[1:23:17] I did not know that he was planning to
[1:23:20] snatch somebody from us but it's also
[1:23:23] good that
[1:23:28] but a good thing is that our person went
[1:23:31] the right hands amen
[1:23:35] in the side of marriage
[1:23:38] and also on the spirituality
[1:23:40] and spiritual side is the most important
[1:23:44] because when they came decide
[1:23:49] I was so concerned to find out where
[1:23:52] their Fellowship is because that is the
[1:23:55] most important amen amen so
[1:23:59] also those who doesn't know me
[1:24:03] my name is
[1:24:08] yeah you come from where you are told
[1:24:11] Western Uganda is
[1:24:18] yeah we have the same faith
[1:24:21] we believe the same message
[1:24:25] we believe in the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:27] Spirit
[1:24:29] we believe in Baptist baptism in Jesus
[1:24:32] name
[1:24:34] we also don't believe in women preachers
[1:24:40] and the I think our women cannot feel
[1:24:45] bad because we have said it like that
[1:24:49] because it is the will of God
[1:24:54] amen amen so we have many things in
[1:24:57] common to enable me to being there
[1:24:59] before we still we believe the same
[1:25:01] message
[1:25:02] we believe the same messenger
[1:25:08] praise God Amen
[1:25:10] and we are always happy together
[1:25:15] what did we give God
[1:25:19] for us to be granted this kind of a
[1:25:22] privilege foreign
[1:25:37] foreign
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:53] to believe this message
[1:25:58] for God to ordain you
[1:26:00] katonda
[1:26:04] cartoon
[1:26:12] that at this moment did you say what you
[1:26:15] said
[1:26:18] at the seventh Church age
[1:26:22] at the end of it
[1:26:26] that you shall receive this message
[1:26:31] amen amen
[1:26:33] the word says
[1:26:35] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:26:39] before that Dreadful day
[1:26:43] and he shall turn over turn the hearts
[1:26:47] of the children
[1:26:51] lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:27:01] amen
[1:27:03] so believing this message
[1:27:05] we must believe it with all our hearts
[1:27:10] I mean
[1:27:12] with all our hearts the second is
[1:27:23] believing the message
[1:27:25] is like I can say it is different
[1:27:30] from
[1:27:31] you know
[1:27:33] we don't want to be just like regular
[1:27:36] Believers
[1:27:40] says that when they meet us
[1:27:43] sisters with long hair
[1:27:46] with long dresses
[1:27:55] we should go beyond that
[1:27:58] amen amen
[1:28:05] I think now in the time we go into the
[1:28:08] word of God
[1:28:10] I mean
[1:28:15] again do you love him
[1:28:18] amen amen
[1:28:22] so let's stand on our feet
[1:28:32] foreign
[1:29:02] The Book of John
[1:29:05] foreign
[1:29:11] first chapter
[1:29:13] and 28th verse
[1:29:19] these things were done Beyond Jordan
[1:29:23] when John was baptizing
[1:29:26] the next day John seeth Jesus coming
[1:29:28] unto him and said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:29:33] which taketh away the sins of the world
[1:29:36] and this is the hymn of whom I said
[1:29:40] after me cometh a man which is preferred
[1:29:43] before me
[1:29:45] for he was before me
[1:29:47] and I knew him not
[1:29:50] but that uh
[1:29:52] but he that he
[1:29:55] manifested to Israel therefore I am
[1:29:58] baptizing with water
[1:30:00] John bear record saying I saw the Spirit
[1:30:03] descending from heaven like a dove and
[1:30:05] it abort upon him
[1:30:10] saying I saw the Spirit descending from
[1:30:14] heaven like a dove and it abound upon
[1:30:17] him
[1:30:18] foreign
[1:31:09] foreign
[1:31:40] auntie
[1:31:56] or your your money
[1:32:01] by God
[1:32:03] Grant the blessings
[1:32:07] may be seated
[1:32:09] amen amen
[1:32:13] so much
[1:32:15] this morning
[1:32:18] I may not run very fast I'm used to
[1:32:21] running
[1:32:28] but I pray that God gives me the grace
[1:32:33] let it be like a teaching service
[1:32:36] because
[1:32:38] because teaching is also important
[1:32:43] sometimes you want to run and we get
[1:32:46] strength
[1:32:47] but we need both of us
[1:32:54] is what I want us to the church and its
[1:32:57] conditions
[1:33:02] amen amen so
[1:33:07] that is what I want us
[1:33:10] oh I will start by quoting
[1:33:12] I want to speak to you to you this
[1:33:14] morning on a parable
[1:33:18] on some way that even the most unjust
[1:33:22] person here would be able to understand
[1:33:26] by your Obama
[1:33:30] now we come to church
[1:33:33] to better ourselves
[1:33:38] amen we come to church
[1:33:42] to better ourselves
[1:33:46] what does this mean it means
[1:33:50] foreign
[1:34:07] but you don't need to leave this place
[1:34:09] the same as you came in why not
[1:34:12] there must be a difference
[1:34:16] we are expecting
[1:34:18] we don't expect a child to be nice
[1:34:21] and remain lying down
[1:34:25] when a child is being born
[1:34:29] there must be a condition of growth
[1:34:32] praise God Amen
[1:34:35] that the child will reach a time and it
[1:34:38] will begin state
[1:34:39] if the child will eat
[1:34:42] he will start with the milk there ain't
[1:34:44] no cooler but he must grow I know
[1:34:48] he must reach a point of eating solid
[1:34:51] food
[1:34:56] he must work
[1:35:00] all those things are in that child
[1:35:02] potentially
[1:35:04] [Applause]
[1:35:07] I mean
[1:35:10] what do I mean praise God Amen
[1:35:14] um
[1:35:15] when uh when uh when the baby's a boy
[1:35:20] Amira Tata that baby is is in a
[1:35:24] potential to be a father
[1:35:28] if he's a she is a mama she is a mother
[1:35:34] she may be young
[1:35:38] so even now
[1:35:40] in this church where we are today
[1:35:43] sometimes we come when we are sinners
[1:35:46] sometimes
[1:35:49] knowing some little things
[1:35:52] but we must grow
[1:35:55] we must move from another level
[1:35:58] to another level
[1:36:01] when we come here without the Holy
[1:36:03] Spirit
[1:36:05] we don't expect to remain without the
[1:36:08] Holy Spirit
[1:36:09] when we come here when we are weak that
[1:36:12] is
[1:36:14] we don't expect to remain weak
[1:36:19] quarreling
[1:36:39] foreign
[1:36:47] what have I said
[1:36:49] huh
[1:36:50] over gambling
[1:36:54] praise God Amen
[1:36:57] we don't expect to remain the same
[1:37:01] way
[1:37:02] and when we remain with such things
[1:37:06] we cannot get anywhere
[1:37:12] there is no other level we can attain to
[1:37:15] cigarette regular Christians
[1:37:21] but we're having nowhere to go
[1:37:24] but as a human being individual I
[1:37:27] believe
[1:37:29] when I speak something here
[1:37:32] foreign
[1:38:40] but you will hear another story praise
[1:38:44] God Amen
[1:38:46] those things
[1:38:48] happening
[1:38:51] in my Ministry way of being treated I've
[1:38:55] found such kind of things I don't want
[1:38:57] to say
[1:38:58] that it is because of three kinds of
[1:39:01] believerses
[1:39:11] because they are another kind of
[1:39:14] believer
[1:39:18] we are here to better ourselves
[1:39:29] we don't come here and sinners
[1:39:33] to remain Sinners
[1:39:39] but God is expecting us that after the
[1:39:43] service
[1:39:46] they become holy men and women
[1:39:50] of the Gospel
[1:39:53] we become holy goddess
[1:39:58] holy boys
[1:40:05] we don't want to become a stumbling
[1:40:07] block
[1:40:10] we don't want to become an independent
[1:40:13] to the church
[1:40:15] we don't want to bring questions here
[1:40:19] we are here for a purpose
[1:40:28] God is Holy
[1:40:31] and his Holiness
[1:40:34] us to be righteousness
[1:40:41] because it is

[1:52:55] praised him to represent him as an
[1:52:58] animal
[1:53:03] and that animal which was the lamb
[1:53:09] went back in the beginning
[1:53:14] the foreshadows of the coming of Jesus
[1:53:18] Christ God sacrifice
[1:53:27] in the foreshadows of the coming of God
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:37] foreshadowing the coming of Christ
[1:53:48] and shedding the blood
[1:53:52] foreign
[1:54:18] foreign
[1:54:36] to bring forth a child
[1:54:41] and that is
[1:54:44] the blood of the beasts
[1:54:47] entered the human race
[1:55:06] foreign
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:56:14] so innocent
[1:56:16] foreign
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:47] [Music]
[1:57:01] was going to represent himself from
[1:57:03] Heaven
[1:57:05] he was represented
[1:57:08] presented humblest of the fools that fly
[1:57:10] in the heavens
[1:57:16] that is
[1:57:33] we are seeing two things here
[1:57:36] the alarm
[1:57:37] um the lamb
[1:57:39] and the dove nature
[1:57:42] they have the same nature is
[1:57:51] one is so Meek and gentle Netherlands
[1:57:55] the same Meek and gentle so
[1:58:05] represents the believer
[1:58:12] represent the Holy Spirit
[1:58:16] and now is
[1:58:20] one cannot be there without the other
[1:58:23] Indigo the ship
[1:58:26] in its Nation
[1:58:33] if it moves along
[1:58:36] it will stray yet
[1:58:41] the ship needs the dove
[1:58:54] it must be obedient
[1:58:59] to the dove
[1:59:06] a believer
[1:59:09] that is how I believe I supposed to be
[1:59:12] to be so obedient like that to the Holy
[1:59:16] Spirit
[1:59:17] who has ever seen the Holy Spirit
[1:59:20] the Holy Spirit
[1:59:24] it has not work on other things
[1:59:30] he works on the ministers
[1:59:32] what I'm trying to say here is
[1:59:38] recognizing Holy Spirit in the man of
[1:59:42] God is
[1:59:55] I don't think I don't expect
[1:59:59] there is one day when he was Pastor
[2:00:03] stood here
[2:00:09] praise God Amen
[2:00:11] are we learning trigger are we listening
[2:00:15] to each other
[2:00:16] this is exactly what the Lord has put on
[2:00:19] my heart
[2:00:24] but to prove that we are lamps
[2:00:28] we must be listening
[2:00:32] we must be humble
[2:00:35] we must be followers
[2:00:39] we must seek the leadership of the Holy
[2:00:42] Spirit
[2:00:43] [Music]
[2:00:44] we must know the will of God
[2:00:50] what the Lord wants us to do
[2:00:53] the Lord wants us
[2:00:56] where the Lord wants us
[2:00:59] the Lord
[2:01:01] so we must be obedient spirits
[2:01:16] foreign
[2:01:19] amen Amina amen
[2:01:27] in the ark
[2:01:30] um
[2:01:30] that I was a dance
[2:01:33] and the death is represented in many
[2:01:36] places in the Bible
[2:01:40] it is the symbol of the Holy Spirit
[2:01:44] and the lamb is represented in many
[2:01:47] places of the Bible
[2:01:53] in Revelation all the way back to
[2:01:56] Genesis
[2:01:58] and
[2:02:03] in Genesis
[2:02:05] the devil therefore in the ark is
[2:02:10] sitting on the roost with the with the
[2:02:12] rest of the force of the air
[2:02:17] and one of them
[2:02:20] was a reverend yeah
[2:02:30] is one of the meanest Birds there is
[2:02:38] I guess
[2:02:40] is about the meanest bird that we can
[2:02:43] find
[2:02:46] is it
[2:02:51] okay
[2:02:53] now amen so when he's speaking about
[2:02:57] this Robin
[2:03:01] we are not just reading the story
[2:03:05] let us look at the nature of this
[2:03:10] first of all
[2:03:11] it was granted a privilege to enter into
[2:03:14] the ark wow
[2:03:16] are we together
[2:03:24] amen so it saw the suffering of the
[2:03:27] people
[2:03:29] how they were being killed everybody
[2:03:41] huh
[2:03:43] it learned nothing
[2:03:46] so no wonder the prophet is talking
[2:03:48] about it like them as as the ministry
[2:04:00] for the days passed
[2:04:03] all the people that interest and it left
[2:04:06] behind the place
[2:04:09] like we enter the air causes
[2:04:12] now let us assume that the act now is
[2:04:15] the message
[2:04:17] so we enter the message
[2:04:19] we understand the message
[2:04:22] we know the Mysteries
[2:04:24] to see how the world is going to end
[2:04:27] you'll have been single again to come
[2:04:29] and see the punishment that is called
[2:04:31] the oncoming judgments
[2:04:34] but then it is
[2:04:53] how Russia is going to punish Americans
[2:04:58] America we know what is happening in
[2:05:01] America
[2:05:04] Catholic President
[2:05:11] we have the sitting vice president who
[2:05:14] is a woman vice president
[2:05:17] something that was prophesied in 194
[2:05:20] 1933
[2:05:27] before some of our grandparents were
[2:05:30] not yet born
[2:05:35] praise God Amen we know those things
[2:05:39] those are also Mysteries when those
[2:05:42] things happen
[2:05:44] we were just like reading the book
[2:05:48] this is what the prophet told us
[2:05:53] we
[2:05:58] learn nothing from me
[2:06:05] so I don't want us to take the nature of
[2:06:08] the Cross
[2:06:11] because we know what is going to happen
[2:06:14] on this world
[2:06:18] the only thing that is hindering those
[2:06:21] things to happen
[2:06:23] is the bride who is still here
[2:06:27] but wait foreign
[2:07:12] foreign
[2:07:31] that that the message was enter the act
[2:07:34] because
[2:07:56] you are in the ark but there is still a
[2:07:59] journey to go
[2:08:02] foreign
[2:08:12] [Applause]
[2:08:27] amen praise God Amen
[2:08:30] Mr Crow
[2:08:34] the flood is
[2:08:36] and the whole world was destroyed
[2:08:59] he
[2:09:04] want to know
[2:09:06] about serious
[2:09:08] whether people are serious
[2:09:11] are they believing
[2:09:12] or they came in the message
[2:09:15] just to hide from the tribulations
[2:09:20] just because they don't want to go to
[2:09:22] hell
[2:09:23] it is why they believe it's the message
[2:09:26] why did you believe the message
[2:09:28] because there is
[2:09:37] because you don't want to go to hell
[2:09:39] as if they told you uh
[2:09:43] that believing the message
[2:09:48] no I have bad news foreign
