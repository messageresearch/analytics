[1:36:55] uganda
[1:36:58] brethren who are seeing me thought that

[1:37:05] giver
[1:37:08] but i had i had
[1:37:10] i was i had
[1:37:13] i was in a covenant with god

[1:37:24] and god had already finished my house
[1:37:33] me i didn't know that as i was building
[1:37:36] for gold they were building for me
[1:37:42] they called me and said mama come on
[1:37:45] and they give me my home but whenever
[1:37:47] after this then that was a mighty
[1:37:50] testimony

[1:37:57] i am not the one who built that home it
[1:37:59] is go to build it

[1:38:50] better
[1:38:53] now
[1:38:54] the brother came and picked money and
[1:38:56] bought chairs in the first time
[1:38:59] transport
[1:39:01] that day i didn't even have money to
[1:39:03] take me back home
[1:39:09] i remember when the mobile money person
[1:39:11] was withdrawing the money i told her
[1:39:13] please ah top up on that money 100 000.
[1:39:18] and i gave brother anger and he bought
[1:39:19] the chairs
[1:39:23] even the next time
[1:39:25] i called him and i told him come and
[1:39:27] pick money
[1:39:29] and i gave him money to buy chairs
[1:39:36] during those days when we are working
[1:39:38] and we probably understand what is going
[1:39:40] on in town
[1:39:49] it has been since five months four
[1:39:52] months ago i've been having daily
[1:39:54] consecutive dreams when i'm dreaming
[1:39:57] traveling somewhere
[1:40:04] and in that dream as i would be moving
[1:40:07] when i would reach in the middle of the
[1:40:08] journey one of my children could come
[1:40:10] and give me a lift and take me to the
[1:40:12] end
[1:40:15] and i would ask god what is the meaning
[1:40:17] of this message
[1:40:19] i couldn't understand it
[1:40:35] i started telling my children through
[1:40:37] messages that i'm done with town i'm
[1:40:39] going back home
[1:40:42] one of my sons told me
[1:40:46] finalize everything
[1:40:55] i'm going to give you all the money you
[1:40:57] will confess in your mouth that you need
[1:41:01] water
[1:41:02] i will give you that money and you begin
[1:41:05] doing what you want
[1:41:08] i finalized everything i was doing
[1:41:11] is like a message
[1:41:13] and they sent me an a
[1:41:15] a blank check
[1:41:17] in the message how much money do you
[1:41:19] want
[1:41:22] oh my god i told him that i want 130
[1:41:26] millions
[1:41:30] and he got 130 millions and gave them to
[1:41:34] me on my account
[1:41:41] i have not closed the previous business
[1:41:43] and i'm having a new business
[1:41:47] tanzania i went to tanzania
[1:41:51] i have my driver he's there
[1:41:58] they said
[1:41:58] i'm going to take you to tanzania you
[1:42:00] buy rice
[1:42:02] in here we went to tanzania
[1:42:08] we bro we bought a trailer of rice
[1:42:12] carrying
[1:42:14] 1060 bags of rice
[1:42:21] 117 millions in a hard cash
[1:42:28] we even paid the taxes of four million
[1:42:32] transport media on a billionaire even
[1:42:34] transport 2.5 million
[1:42:38] we even paid the workers 500 thousands
[1:42:45] i don't know what i can tell you never
[1:42:47] break out i thank the grace of god
[1:42:52] for good words
[1:43:17] the rice
[1:43:18] but the market is still unstable and
[1:43:20] even customers are not yet aware of our
[1:43:23] product but we believe the lord who has
[1:43:26] done this will do the rest
[1:43:31] those are the miracles that god have
[1:43:33] done for me
[1:43:36] this is
[1:43:40] he has done that not in a church which
[1:43:43] tells us to sow seeds but in a church
[1:43:46] which they listen which preaches to us
[1:43:48] the word of god
[1:43:54] hallelujah hallelujah what god has done
[1:43:57] for others he can do for you
[1:44:01] we have a god that never fails and a god
[1:44:03] that keeps all his appointments
[1:44:08] i told you
[1:44:10] when we were beginning to collect our
[1:44:11] land funds
[1:44:14] that priorities
[1:44:18] and he will do the same for you
[1:44:21] so i encourage you to continue doing the
[1:44:23] same but
[1:44:25] i was called delivered
[1:44:27] our god provide cause
[1:44:29] our god
[1:44:31] don't think it is someone's testimony
[1:44:33] can as well be your testimony
[1:44:38] may even be different
[1:44:42] what is the same god
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:46] so now this morning i would like us to
[1:44:48] ask ourselves a question why do
[1:44:49] christians suffer afflictions
[1:44:56] do christians suffer afflictions
[1:45:00] do we go through temptation so do it
[1:45:03] anymore we came up
[1:45:05] yes but why
[1:45:08] shouldn't our life be well
[1:45:12] and it is very appropriate that we have
[1:45:13] had a testimony this morning i think and
[1:45:16] she said that you should not change
[1:45:17] anymore what would he do with judaism
[1:45:19] because now sister rose can say i know
[1:45:21] man
[1:45:24] i know
[1:45:25] that's my redeemer
[1:45:28] and i know
[1:45:42] many are the afflictions of the
[1:45:44] righteous but the law delivers him out
[1:45:46] of them
[1:45:51] so now the first we talked about
[1:45:54] on wednesday is that god allows us to go
[1:45:56] through suffering so that he can make
[1:45:58] his attributes known to us
[1:46:09] he wants his attributes to be known to
[1:46:11] us
[1:46:15] quickly return to your body goes to the
[1:46:17] book of revelation chapter 2 verse 8
[1:46:24] praise the name of the lord yet i'm
[1:46:25] coming here
[1:46:26] amen and then and i always try to
[1:46:30] be
[1:46:30] not a lengthy preacher so if you can
[1:46:32] support me and preach together with me
[1:46:34] then i can try to be as brief as
[1:46:37] possible
[1:46:45] and then all of us will be blessed i
[1:46:46] wanna finish
[1:46:48] and i'm to the edge of the church in
[1:46:50] samana right this thing says the first
[1:46:52] and the last which was dead and is alive
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:06] oh
[1:47:11] and tribulation and poverty but thou art
[1:47:14] rich and i know the blasphemy of them
[1:47:16] which say that they are jews and are not
[1:47:18] but at the synagogue of saturn
[1:47:35] shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast
[1:47:38] some of you into prison that he may be
[1:47:40] tried and he shall have tribulation ten
[1:47:42] days be thou faithful unto death and i
[1:47:45] will give thee a crown of life
[1:48:00] [Music]
[1:48:10] what the spirit of satan to the churches
[1:48:12] he that overcometh shall not be heart of
[1:48:15] the second death i
[1:48:24] you know there were ministers of the
[1:48:27] message who were arrested in china some
[1:48:29] years ago
[1:48:45] church one way can you say 2137
[1:48:48] they do not uh preach even publicly also
[1:48:51] it's the only church which is allowed by
[1:48:52] the state you can say okay
[1:48:56] and then the other churches they do
[1:48:58] underground church
[1:49:02] one day when i was in one of these
[1:49:03] cities
[1:49:06] i think i was in shenzhen not even
[1:49:08] saying i had we had gone to visit a
[1:49:09] factory tried it against a child in
[1:49:11] accordance and then as we entered into
[1:49:14] the the factory 23 indirect
[1:49:17] everybody was working people were busy
[1:49:21] and then i noticed that there was
[1:49:24] uh
[1:49:25] this man came and pushed something
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:50:20] and so we went and uh we were preaching
[1:50:23] on that i think it was about the 10th
[1:50:25] floor
[1:50:29] and it was in a believer's home
[1:50:33] and we had a knock on the door
[1:50:37] and i was preaching in english and
[1:50:38] brother ivan was inter preaching to me
[1:50:41] for me into chinese
[1:50:47] and
[1:50:48] as i was preaching
[1:50:50] we
[1:51:05] you take care we had our bibles in a
[1:51:08] bible is the faith you know it's not
[1:51:09] allowed to do that the chicken is what
[1:51:11] you call them even allowed to have
[1:51:13] bibles
[1:51:14] so
[1:51:15] those will be taken as exhibits
[1:51:18] and so um
[1:51:20] the brother froze
[1:51:25] was interpreted
[1:51:26] the whole people froze
[1:51:28] university come on froze
[1:51:31] so we did not know what to do next
[1:51:34] and no one had the guts to go and open
[1:51:36] the door
[1:51:39] but one brother
[1:51:40] you know
[1:51:41] kind of gathered the gaps and he was he
[1:51:42] was going to go and open
[1:51:44] me
[1:51:45] up
[1:51:46] so
[1:52:13] if i'm going to be killed or arrested

[1:52:59] and we preached on

[2:49:37] i've been trying to run away from but
[2:49:39] he's telling me to share it with you
[2:49:49] i was in ethiopia one day
[2:49:52] and there was some brothers coming from
[2:49:55] from canada some place
[2:49:58] and but the biscuit told me of them
[2:50:04] brother and his wife
[2:50:06] and they were coming from tanzania by
[2:50:08] their tanzania and they were going to
[2:50:10] back home
[2:50:12] and so europe is the main half of most
[2:50:14] of these um flights ethiopia
[2:50:17] [Music]
[2:50:20] um uh for a few hours
[2:50:25] and at that moment
[2:50:27] the brother contacted me and said we've
[2:50:29] landed and if you could just come at the
[2:50:31] airport and meet with us
[2:50:48] and so when we arrived there
[2:50:50] too
[2:50:51] um long story short
[2:50:53] he was not allowed to enter
[2:50:56] because this is now like the main gate
[2:50:58] going to the to canada to the states so
[2:51:00] they don't allow people to enter
[2:51:01] actually the departure gate if you don't
[2:51:03] have a ticket
[2:51:05] again
[2:51:11] and so but i found my way through i had
[2:51:13] this coffee i bought for the brother
[2:51:31] and um the coffee and everything else
[2:51:34] so i left him with everything
[2:51:37] and i left again

[3:45:27] [Music]
[3:45:38] daddy you are lonely
[3:45:42] [Music]
[3:46:04] for just a moment
[3:46:15] [Music]
[3:46:22] [Music]
[3:46:25] i just wanted to update you
[3:46:28] but again what to do says been a while
[3:46:30] without updating you because
[3:46:33] i know most of us
[3:46:34] have
[3:46:45] so i'm not surprised that there is not
[3:46:47] much contributions in the past to
[3:47:08] so
[3:47:08] we
[3:47:10] uh
[3:47:11] pledged about three point five twelve
[3:47:14] million building h2o but not all of it
[3:47:17] has been
[3:47:18] fulfilled
[3:47:27] and i really want to say god bless you
[3:47:29] for your contribution okay
[3:47:43] i don't think i need to read names you
[3:47:45] know yourselves
[3:47:49] i think one brother will call each of
[3:47:51] you and remind you to fulfill your
[3:47:53] pledges
[3:47:56] because remember
[3:47:57] those pledges
[3:47:59] that
[3:48:00] you met
[3:48:02] was the renter of this place frank said
[3:48:04] fortune was for the initial six months
[3:48:10] and
[3:48:12] we already paid it because we took it
[3:48:14] from our land fund and that was this
[3:48:17] sentence
[3:48:19] and so you need to pay it back so that
[3:48:21] you can be taken back
[3:48:23] and send us a 120 so whatever i will
[3:48:26] announce as the land fund does not mean
[3:48:28] we have it
[3:48:32] is the tucker city now until you fulfill
[3:48:35] all your places
[3:48:38] you understand that
[3:48:41] so uh
[3:48:43] so that means it is short of 959 pounds
[3:48:51] but also
[3:48:53] when we
[3:48:54] when we arrived here between fortuna
[3:48:58] there was was no doors
[3:49:02] and we had to put in these doors
[3:49:07] both of them emiliano
[3:49:22] even trivial because they said what
[3:49:25] but
[3:49:26] after inserting them in the building but
[3:49:28] while they tell me
[3:49:30] we agreed with the owner that it will
[3:49:31] all be counted as part of our rent
[3:49:34] is
[3:49:39] so there is more money we have spent
[3:49:41] than you promised to give catholic
[3:49:43] center is a singapore
[3:49:44] is the two was there to spend these
[3:49:46] things
[3:49:49] yes
[3:49:50] so
[3:49:51] i do not have the the details here every
[3:49:54] single moment
[3:49:55] that is because brother you give me your
[3:49:57] report but the martin he did not give me
[3:49:59] yours
[3:50:00] been waiting for this
[3:50:02] year
[3:50:07] we have paid
[3:50:09] a total of
[3:50:11] 10 months 11. i think 11 11 months
[3:50:18] ago
[3:50:32] we will not need to look for rent the
[3:50:34] children know you're saying
[3:50:37] but uh you will need to contribute for
[3:50:40] the money of the four how many more
[3:50:43] months is it
[3:50:44] because they had promised six months
[3:50:47] but then we paid for eleven so how many
[3:50:49] more months
[3:50:51] five
[3:50:52] so that and that is eight each month is
[3:50:55] five hundred thousand
[3:50:57] whereas
[3:50:58] our time for five months how much is
[3:51:00] that money is no
[3:51:03] 2.5 million building h2 so we need 2.5
[3:51:07] plus this
[3:51:08] about a million so that's about uh 3.5
[3:51:11] knows of cutting up certain h2
[3:51:14] to
[3:51:14] put back on our landfans
[3:51:24] we are in debt of 3.5 million which has
[3:51:28] been spent towards our rental for this
[3:51:30] sentence
[3:51:35] now in addition
[3:51:39] you see this place is beautiful like
[3:51:40] this
[3:51:43] and you know we came without two
[3:51:45] speakers here
[3:51:47] and obviously
[3:51:49] and when the brothers plugged it in
[3:51:52] it would not make any sound
[3:51:56] the room was empty
[3:51:58] so we noticed
[3:52:00] we needed more speakers
[3:52:02] we were able to get the best speakers
[3:52:08] and
[3:52:09] the
[3:52:10] the
[3:52:11] this one is called the monitor
[3:52:13] monitor we need another monitor
[3:52:17] and also some other
[3:52:19] brothers help me what is the names of
[3:52:21] those
[3:52:25] crossover
[3:52:28] program an amplifier and a crossover
[3:52:31] give someone a microphone there let them
[3:52:33] explain to the church what do those
[3:52:34] things do
[3:52:36] is
[3:52:41] so you must explain to us in a way that
[3:52:43] after you have explained to us we can be
[3:52:44] able to pray for them
[3:52:50] god bless you change
[3:52:52] when we come in this place we are able
[3:52:53] to buy
[3:52:56] one
[3:52:57] we're able to buy two more things here
[3:53:00] one of you maybe
[3:53:03] apart from this what jacob is in that
[3:53:06] age so we bought new amplifier we had
[3:53:09] one two arduino amplifiers
[3:53:12] yeah but it was weak
[3:53:16] so this one is
[3:53:18] more powerful
[3:53:35] the sound from the from the base
[3:53:39] crossover
[3:53:42] area
[3:53:45] because
[3:53:46] these
[3:53:47] speakers they're not supposed to receive
[3:53:49] this
[3:53:53] area
[3:53:54] because if they receive best they will
[3:53:56] they get support
[3:53:59] so this is supposed to go
[3:54:02] [Music]
[3:54:16] yes so it sends the best there
[3:54:19] under the sound
[3:54:21] again
[3:54:24] again
[3:54:27] then
[3:54:29] on top of this we added this

[4:00:10] and uh
[4:00:12] also there are other things that we have
[4:00:14] worked here what would they be
[4:00:15] interpreted here
[4:00:17] and uh that's the carpeting
[4:00:20] capacity
[4:00:37] amen come in
[4:00:39] uh
[4:00:40] i believe jesus is clean
[4:00:43] yes
[4:00:44] and they invite him to worship to him it
[4:00:45] should also be created
[4:01:01] so
[4:01:02] um and we failed to do all these
[4:01:06] because we are going to be here for a
[4:01:08] little while
[4:01:11] to be correct yes
[4:01:14] as we are
[4:01:16] we are
[4:01:18] concluding with our contributions for
[4:01:20] the land
[4:01:25] once we have settled all our debts here
[4:01:29] again back towards our land contribution
[4:01:40] and so i want him to give us a report
[4:01:42] also i know you gave me
[4:01:44] the financial report but tell us
[4:01:56] absolutely
[4:01:58] uh
[4:02:11] foreign
[4:03:02] [Music]
[4:04:02] foreign
[4:04:07] okay
[4:04:09] okay so you need to add that on the one
[4:04:11] point six
[4:04:13] once
[4:04:18] to come up
[4:04:32] foreign this curtain and timbers you
[4:04:36] know
[4:04:37] was designed most but all these things
[4:04:39] were done by believers
[4:04:44] i think 90 percent believers
[4:04:48] was done by a sister
[4:04:50] miracle i know most of you know her
[4:04:52] manina miracle you have to take care of
[4:04:54] timbers you know
[4:04:56] mr miracle we know her because she was
[4:04:58] the one that
[4:05:00] i think she did the hairdressing of my
[4:05:01] wife on her wedding money man
[4:05:05] and brothers
[4:05:27] so
[4:05:28] it was my choice
[4:05:33] but uh
[4:05:34] i believe it will serve us
[4:05:38] and honestly brother martin unless you
[4:05:40] remind me i do not remember how much it
[4:05:42] was
[4:05:42] much an imposing one because that's duke
[4:05:44] is the same
[4:06:03] yes
[4:06:05] it includes everything how much total
[4:06:25] force
[4:06:29] now
[4:06:30] we
[4:06:31] i don't know if i've forgotten anything
[4:06:35] yeah
[4:06:35] these flowers were just my gift every
[4:06:38] morning
[4:07:14] [Music]
[4:07:31] for your glory has come
[4:07:34] amen
[4:07:36] all right god bless you come on come to
[4:07:38] your sister so sister
[4:07:40] this is your responsibility
[4:07:45] if they look ugly
[4:07:59] so
[4:07:59] so
[4:08:00] of course this because the outer was
[4:08:02] ending
[4:08:41] all right so if you said it looks good
[4:08:42] then give a clap of praise
[4:08:53] but i think that one we can always take
[4:08:55] it upon ourselves maybe enough
[4:08:58] now there is also a need
[4:09:04] to go the piano
[4:09:06] and the piano
[4:09:08] the one that we want to buy costs
[4:09:10] uh
[4:09:11] a minimum of five 5.5 million million
[4:09:22] i've already found one i pray they don't
[4:09:25] take it away because they're rare
[4:09:47] all right now
[4:09:49] uh yesterday
[4:09:51] joe
[4:09:53] i thought
[4:09:54] brother martin
[4:10:09] you'll carry me to a room
[4:10:11] so if you don't know these things you'll
[4:10:12] be like
[4:10:17] maybe they are robbing them they are
[4:10:18] cheating them but you know
[4:10:20] those
[4:10:21] very correct prices aj when they meet
[4:10:24] we'll need another one here two targets
[4:10:27] we also have that camera which we
[4:10:29] procrastinate
[4:10:32] but i i thought that i should i should
[4:10:34] put that on myself not always
[4:10:42] because it will be a heavy financial
[4:10:44] burden
[4:10:47] and the laptop they are using the other
[4:10:49] side
[4:10:50] i think i need to put that on you for
[4:10:53] now
[4:10:54] now
[4:10:57] the things we've gone through
[4:10:59] i need someone with a calculator with a
[4:11:00] very sharp mind to do some auditions for
