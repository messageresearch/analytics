[1:01:38] we read Genesis chapter 2 verse 15.
[1:01:46] and the Lord God took the man and put
[1:01:48] him in the into the Garden of Eden to
[1:01:51] dress it and to keep it
[1:01:54] um
[1:01:58] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[1:02:02] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[1:02:04] freely eat
[1:02:06] but of the tree of their knowledge of
[1:02:08] Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[1:02:10] for in the day that thou eatst thereof
[1:02:13] Thou shalt surely die
[1:02:16] said
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:30] and we read verse 21.
[1:02:36] a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[1:02:39] slept and he took one of the of his ribs
[1:02:43] and closed up the flesh instead they
[1:02:45] Arrow
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:02:57] which the Lord God had taken from the
[1:03:00] man made he a woman and brought her unto
[1:03:04] the man
[1:03:07] massage
[1:03:13] amen mean and Adam said this is now one
[1:03:17] of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she
[1:03:21] shall be called a woman because she was
[1:03:23] taken out of man
[1:03:39] a man leave his father and his mother
[1:03:42] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[1:03:45] shall be one flesh
[1:03:47] um
[1:03:55] and they were both naked the man and his
[1:03:58] wife and we are not ashamed
[1:04:01] um
[1:04:08] Amina
[1:04:10] katsabi a precious love in Jesus
[1:04:14] we're so grateful this morning
[1:04:17] to know that even as Adam was taken even
[1:04:20] as Eve was taken out of Adam
[1:04:26] we have also been taken out of you
[1:04:30] the man from such we are the female
[1:04:33] parts
[1:04:34] we are the church
[1:04:37] and we have come here this morning
[1:04:40] so that you can fashion us into your
[1:04:43] image
[1:04:44] that we will be pleasing to you even my
[1:04:48] sincere prayer this morning Lord
[1:04:50] foreign
[1:05:43] a woman of virtue part three
[1:05:45] um
[1:05:49] can you get a better word of virtue
[1:05:58] oh
[1:06:00] um
[1:06:03] no but we have already dealt with these
[1:06:05] two services so you know what we're
[1:06:07] talking about because I'm wrong that's
[1:06:09] the right word
[1:06:10] um
[1:06:11] all right and then but this morning I'm
[1:06:15] specifically speaking on a sacred trust
[1:06:19] which is
[1:06:27] how many here have asked the appetite of
[1:06:31] the word this morning
[1:06:35] amen I mean some I'm requesting that you
[1:06:38] put your undivided attention
[1:06:45] avoid movements as much as we can today
[1:07:42] is something that is given to someone
[1:07:44] when
[1:07:48] now the person who has received the
[1:07:51] trust is can be called a trustee
[1:07:56] Monica and the trustee
[1:08:00] does not necessarily benefit directly
[1:08:03] from the trust
[1:08:08] but listen that trust is given to him
[1:08:12] for the benefit of others
[1:08:16] and so we want to look at that this
[1:08:19] morning
[1:08:25] that God has given to us
[1:08:29] but before we talk about the sacred
[1:08:31] trust that God has given please
[1:08:33] let's look at at Adam
[1:08:39] the Bible says that the Lord God formed
[1:08:42] man in his own image
[1:08:46] and man was in the image and likeness of
[1:08:49] God
[1:08:51] he gave him Eden the Garden of Eden to
[1:08:55] dress and keep it
[1:09:00] and if you look at verse 16 of chapter 2
[1:09:03] is and the Lord God formed the Lord God
[1:09:05] commanded the man saying of every tree
[1:09:08] of the garden thou mayest freely eat is
[1:09:23] but of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:09:25] Evil
[1:09:28] Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[1:09:32] that you eat thereof that shall surely
[1:09:34] die
[1:09:37] now this was a sacred trust
[1:09:40] The God Who had entrusted to Adam
[1:09:45] God had given his word
[1:09:48] to his son and which comes
[1:09:51] trusted him you see a good Trustee of
[1:09:55] that word
[1:10:01] but of this one which is the tree of
[1:10:04] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:10:07] surely not eat of it now there are three
[1:10:11] categories of trees
[1:10:14] and this we can just look at it briefly
[1:10:17] there is the Tree of Life which was in
[1:10:20] the middle
[1:10:23] foreign
[1:11:46] why because he was eating from the Tree
[1:11:49] of Life
[1:13:06] and so you don't
[1:13:08] come on
[1:13:11] told us we could eat him
[1:13:14] and he told us we could drink
[1:13:17] because his brother was food
[1:13:22] and he said I am the life
[1:13:29] foreign
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:19] foreign
[1:15:19] was cast down on Earth
[1:15:21] and and he be he became the devil now
[1:15:24] focused on
[1:15:27] praise the name of the Lord
[1:15:30] but before we see this scenario
[1:15:33] of knowledge was there um
[1:15:47] not to eat
[1:15:50] of
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:16:11] don't tell us that God let the devil
[1:16:14] come on us why didn't you want Adam
[1:16:16] foreign
[1:16:34] and then on down
[1:16:37] verse 21. God causes a sleep to fall on
[1:16:41] him
[1:16:44] and he out of his ribs
[1:16:54] Hallelujah man and he met a woman
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:06] and Adam's saying now this is one of my
[1:17:08] bones and Flesh of My Flesh you shall be
[1:17:10] called a woman because she was taken out
[1:17:11] of this
[1:17:16] but then what happened after that
[1:17:21] Genesis
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:31] when the woman came out of the moon
[1:17:37] is a part of the man um
[1:17:46] he can now be able to access
[1:17:52] by using the woman
[1:17:55] and when the devil did that she beguiled
[1:17:59] the woman
[1:18:06] foreign
[1:19:17] and I did it
[1:19:22] praise the name of the Lord
[1:19:25] I'm keeping quiet for a moment because
[1:19:29] I wanted to imagine this is
[1:19:34] God himself
[1:19:37] trusting you
[1:19:39] if he trusts you
[1:19:42] I'm so happy sister John name
[1:19:47] it means he has confidence
[1:19:52] it means he has decided to treat you as
[1:19:57] a prostitution against us
[1:20:01] he believed you will keep the trust
[1:20:05] sayakuma always he believes in you
[1:20:09] God believed in Adam
[1:20:12] why why because Adam was born of his own
[1:20:16] flesh of his flesh
[1:20:20] the image of God himself
[1:20:24] but when the woman came out of Adam
[1:20:28] the woman had those virtues
[1:20:32] but she was not able to keep it yeah
[1:20:41] Adam
[1:20:53] um
[1:21:04] he says let the woman learn in Silence
[1:21:07] with all subjections
[1:21:14] but I serve another woman to teach
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:19] authority over the man
[1:21:22] to be in silence
[1:21:30] and Adam was not deceived
[1:21:34] listen now but the woman being deceived
[1:21:40] was in the translation
[1:21:46] so the woman was deceived
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:50] and because she was the one who was
[1:21:51] deceived
[1:21:53] she was in the transgression yeah
[1:21:57] in Genesis as you say the serpent
[1:21:59] beguard me
[1:22:02] um
[1:22:04] the scripture says so is the way of an
[1:22:06] adult
[1:22:10] she eats and wipes her mouth
[1:22:13] and says
[1:22:17] what exactly did Eve
[1:22:22] put up that verse from me so it's the
[1:22:24] way of and now that is
[1:22:27] ready what's adultery
[1:22:30] all of you know what I doubting I know
[1:22:32] where is the movement so the scripture
[1:22:34] says the woman who has committed
[1:22:37] adultery
[1:22:40] she says after she has done it after she
[1:22:43] eats
[1:22:44] eating here means the act that she has
[1:22:47] died
[1:22:51] and the Bible says here the serpent the
[1:22:55] woman says the sun happened
[1:23:12] and she received to sit now foreign

[2:08:03] entrusted with a character that a woman
[2:08:06] is
[2:08:11] that she must be precious special um
[2:08:26] a woman was not even in the beginning of
[2:08:29] creation
[2:08:33] because God knew that she would fall
[2:08:37] all other females could not commit
[2:08:39] adultery
[2:08:42] she's the only one that could and can't
[2:08:49] commitment like the original
[2:08:53] that would be that would have been
[2:08:55] discomplemented to God it's great wisdom
[2:09:00] was made a byproduct of a man

[2:09:12] it's also been given a sacred charge
[2:09:19] for Redemption God has given a woman
[2:09:24] church

[2:12:23] she cannot be testified
[2:12:27] I will strike that in a little bit
[2:12:32] she can be forgiven for our defilement
[2:12:37] but she cannot be justified in this life
[2:12:42] always with her
[2:14:07] foreign is trying to make men pregnant
[2:14:12] but that is not how it is
[2:14:15] God never put it that way
[2:14:18] that's why the body of a man is
[2:14:20] different from the body of a woman
[2:14:23] the body of a woman is so precious
[2:14:29] because it was given to bring forth life
[2:14:36] foreign
[2:14:59] now here is where you may disagree he

[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:35] descriptions
[2:15:38] we find that our body is depending

[3:31:55] brunette
[3:31:57] myself my wife brother
[3:32:00] hashems Peter
[3:32:35] umale of Ginger yeah
[3:32:39] and he surprised me yesterday
[3:32:43] when he sent us 255 pounds
[3:32:49] and they said it is
[3:32:58] a lot good
[3:33:09] who are you it increases
[3:33:13] what you're looking for is being
[3:33:17] but our God
[3:33:20] and as of today
[3:33:24] what we as the church has contributed
[3:33:30] including the PVP fans
[3:33:35] DV3 is 22 million billionaire minimum
[3:33:39] Billy 700.00
[3:33:45] now that only includes about 7 million
[3:33:48] to all and a little extra of the other
[3:33:50] funds there's a political Million
[3:33:52] numbers
[3:33:57] which is meant for another project this
[3:33:59] is
[3:34:02] allowed to get you one so that you can
[3:34:05] accumulate quickly
[3:34:09] um
[3:34:11] Now 23 Millions
[3:34:16] in uh how many months
[3:34:20] um
[3:34:23] okay I do not have the whole in
[3:34:25] front of me
[3:34:27] but you can count when did we start
[3:34:28] contributing
[3:34:31] anybody remember all right
[3:34:39] was it October last year
[3:34:43] so you can now count the ones who are
[3:34:45] good in Matthew can quickly and tell us
[3:34:47] how many months
[3:34:52] about 10 months
[3:34:55] now I believe you would have been far
[3:34:58] more than this because
[3:35:02] but I think some people who started in
[3:35:04] fire
[3:35:06] they reduce the fire
[3:35:10] if God provided for you then
[3:35:14] why not now
[3:35:16] security
[3:35:17] so I believe it's the fire
[3:35:20] we need more fire better come on
[3:35:24] how many agreement
[3:35:28] I don't care how much you're giving you
[3:35:37] Sister Martin even if it's 200 Shillings
[3:35:39] from the tomatoes
[3:35:43] give something
[3:35:56] account using that uh code yeah yeah
[3:36:03] 100 shillings every day
[3:36:06] those people refuse to declare who they
[3:36:09] were yeah
[3:36:13] but your giving is recorded
[3:36:16] one on earth and in heaven
[3:36:18] I don't say you gave for a few days and
[3:36:21] you stopped
[3:36:24] it was 100 shillings
[3:36:30] and it came on the account
[3:36:32] so all of you can do it
[3:36:35] you don't need to send if you are
[3:36:38] sending money too small you don't need
[3:36:40] to send to me auto brother Joel but what
[3:36:42] is the center neighborhood
[3:36:44] send it directly and then kindly that me
[3:36:48] or brother Joe will know so we can check
[3:36:50] the returns
[3:36:54] yes we appreciate that
[3:36:57] make note of that number
[3:37:00] and also there was brother brother Caleb
[3:37:03] I don't know whether it's on now but
[3:37:04] usually streams
[3:37:08] is in a place where there is no charge
[3:37:13] us so so he was telling me thing number
[3:37:16] that he would also like to contribute
[3:37:18] months
[3:37:21] and I I don't know about that Joel if

[3:37:41] never every time
[3:37:44] how many believe they can do that
[3:37:47] you see the hands
[3:37:50] so I believe you can do it because I'm
[3:37:52] sorry the business people you can do it
[3:37:54] our consonants it cannot bring down your
[3:37:57] business business
[3:38:05] amen by the end of the year
[3:38:08] something can happen
[3:38:12] I've been thinking of a lot of solutions
[3:38:17] but like I said I'm still waiting on God
[3:38:20] I do not want to make any random
[3:38:22] decisions
[3:38:29] I went to the bank
[3:38:31] they told me they can give me money
[3:38:35] they told me they cannot give us money
[3:38:37] as a church because we we have been only
[3:38:40] running the account for uh about six or
[3:38:43] seven months
[3:38:45] this
[3:39:28] whether we have a brother giving us
[3:39:30] alone or not or at the bank or not We
[3:39:33] are continuing to contribute until we
[3:39:35] have all the fans
[3:39:42] the only problem is if we take a loan to
[3:39:46] the bank
[3:39:47] our button will increase
[3:39:51] if we take a loan from an individual
[3:39:53] foreign
[3:40:49] you remain on the bank account
[3:41:04] who are you
[3:41:06] and the lotteries
[3:41:09] we will hit the target
[3:41:12] no matter how long it takes
[3:41:15] you only needs us to have the right
[3:41:17] visions
[3:41:20] and frankly speaking this place is
[3:41:24] becoming more uncomfortable
[3:41:28] especially on Sundays
[3:41:31] the other Sunday I noticed people who
[3:41:33] were in the tents
[3:41:39] and sometimes
[3:41:42] very uncomfortable
[3:41:44] we need to have a better place
[3:41:47] singers or really pray about this and
[3:41:51] not only pray but contribute and also
[3:41:55] those who follow our services online
[3:42:02] because I know we have many people who
[3:42:04] follow ourselves
[3:42:07] otherwise God bless you come over
