young people have already left for for school maniacal so those who remain during the school time you have to say more amends now even those who are outside you have to say more amen praise the lord amen sister sarah i'm happy to see you after quite a long time amen revelation 12 we are going to read there we go and by the way our interpreter is not here and so this brother is helping out by biology brother i i have not heard from him personally but i understand brother wanga and his wife is it the whole family or only with his wife with the children parts of the family here oh yeah okay so uh him and his wife um i understand they traveled somewhere about rather than which are the way do not have that united states okay oh yours we are reading revelation 12. verses 7 to 13. and there was war in heaven michael and his angels okay i'll read it again yeah that's better brother marvin god bless you and there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against fault and his angels i think we can read verse by verse i hope you're ready okay and prevailed not neither was there was there a place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and saturn which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out [Music] saying in heaven now it's come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of jesus christ for the accused of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night [Music] and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and we overcame him hallelujah amen by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony and they loved not their lives and we loved not our lives even unto death [Applause] never rejoice rejoice you heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea and for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because you know it that he has at a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man said okay we'll not get into that part praise the lord let us uh speak to the lord a bit not to get any more camera father once again we come before you and welcome to your muscle appreciate you once again for the word which we have read this is your holy word that will give me inspiration you'll help my brother who is standing in the corner i meet them with you that are listening in this morning that you will give them also inspiration to be able to receive it amen i'd like to speak a little bit about jesus really whenever we meet we talk about jesus what do you want to sing on a tour get a queen and uh i am going to uh kindly request for your undivided attention uh your mind let me comment my name let it not go around just be in one place like a tournament for chimo and let us be in one accord one spirit and those who are outside the only way i can be able to know you're following is by shouting praise the lord amen and so i'm going to speak about jesus and my subject is the reason why he came here and i've spoken about this some years ago i think about three or four years ago when we were in kenya meetings i also did speak about the subjects so this morning we shall go over it and know that many of you that are now here we are not here then so i'm hoping that watch your masala why why why did he come watch yet and so i will begin with a quote from the message go awake jesus go go wake jesus [Applause] amen amen when you speak the word the word has created power boy okay he is the word but god had to use man to fulfill the song that you took to display his attribute over the same balance you see as much as the past the world is powerful and display his attitude god in the beginning was just was he wasn't even god how many knew that in the beginning [Applause] [Applause] but we were not made just to worship you see when you read the bible you will not find find a bat oh um you will not find a creation account of engines [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] praise the name of the lord amen so angels that's my america we are created for what purpose amen amen god always loves worship and do not worship something else worship god those things shall not sins are catholic worship or worship is a big subject you know and now i want to bring it down after he has created angels then before we come to our scripture here you know which we have read will come to it shortly read together one two three go now god is gone he has now become god that you have said he is not an object of worship so by the time we are opening our bibles that we are truly a biblical prayer he amen and now we're not sure you don't want to turn about that as we calm down whenever we took our way to kill him see god now begins creating more expressing more of his attributes [Applause] you know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everything of loneliness [Applause] [Music] but there was no one creature which was an express image of himself [Applause] amen what does god mean that's not just against our tree yes object of worship battle that you take against the identity since you were so god created what do you think was the purpose why he was creating that man told you why can somebody tell me what was what yes my sister [Music] yes to manifest but you know you had already manifested these attributes through all these other things because those who are part of his attributes but yes also this was a manifestation of his attributes in his own image and i told you that you see because god created [Applause] was in the image of god and that's what separates us from all the futures [Applause] the real man that god created is in the image of god god not all of us are safe praise the name of the lord amen and by the time we we finish up i know you were well normally would you take a day and so we noticed that man that god created was in the image of god he was in the likeness of god yes and why did god create him god he created him for specific replenished no no those are not the right words conquer to subdue to conquer can somebody please if you have a record throw it out quickly yes yes okay the naturally young i am lord over this come away you realize that this is in the nature of man what's your my energy you find even [Music] where did this come from for who you are where did these things of gates come from foreign everybody over this entire [Applause] over [Music] wait wait wait and the reason we were in the right way because we are a part of god and god is the only thing that's eternal [Music] we in jesus christ eternal so he was disturbing us during the preaching of the world you know the word arrested those demons [Applause] [Applause] to be amen praise the name of the lord amen and so we know this here why not to love her that man has always been a part of god hormone to buddhic and god is the only thing that is a tunnel [Music] me but we [Applause] [Music] he had not expressed an image out of him yes [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm sorry brother you do not tell me that you're going to give this testament but i think let me talk about it because it's in the line of this he brother marvin told me brother young amber as i was speaking i had not had a good smartphone for a long time when i spoke about a little bit of the authority that we have when are you getting a couple years between now you speak what's up existence i spoke my phone into existence and this is only the second next sunday yeah sunday wednesday did it happen brother happened it happened in existence [Music] we are flesh of his flesh we are born of his born today and the life of his life then we can no more perish [Applause] well i'm not just is [Music] is a man to watch over everything adam was not just like other creatures he was in the image and likeness of god he was in the image of god and likeness of god himself adam was a part of god adam yeah for how to have attributes of god in him you know that's why it was not good for him to dwell alone i'm not talking about elohim amen self one he was alone allow me to use that word he was by himself now we see that song you are gone from the beginning [Music] he manifested his attribute like brother dr peter said he manifested his attributes let me tell you whenever i think about that with the windows i could change it i just feel like crying in my house you could be born in any family that you were born in among any people you were born whatever you were born the part of christ [Music] they don't manifest themselves but they manifest the character of god foreign hallelujah amen you know i met one person one day and he said where do you people preach like that because you have nothing in this life who believe this message [Music] he will go in the villages tell people about the coming of the lord now tell me what is that what is that that is a life of his life numbers about finding the previous nether seed why are you here because you are a predestination is where to come with you for where you feel you are ashamed of him that certainly shows the nature and character that you have nobody praise the lord amen okay let's carry on a little bit more here he says um genesis 2 18 brother give it give me the verse says and the lord god says it's not good that man should be alone if it were if god did not feel happy to be he was missing m that man should be alone i will make him and help me yeah and the rib we the lord god are taken from man and brought her unto the man amen that's why when you read the bible yesterday the bible types the church as a woman revelation 19 7. let us speak louder hallelujah wife hallelujah amen if you're his wife and you hear that you know it should not make you look down i teaching you you have to rejoice oh you know sanyuka if you have chains that are binding amen if you go with them they'll kill you brother says [Applause] [Applause] he ran away from the surgery is not allowed well and then we find that when god had already uh you know finished operating on adam wrong and god made sure he puts eve on the side of adams it's not god who chooses for you he designed for you but not the one to choose for you some people wait for dreams but in the video they wait for dreams but they belong to sister that's how god dying so sisters in the message do not propose are you hearing me so we don't want a bunch of sisters proposing to younger brothers again i could take our publication of our brothers sister proposed the best [Music] [Music] and then and then he started natandika i told you there is power in the spoken word and the spoken one is the original seed and the word come and the seed always the man is the bearer of the sister woman system of childhood says i even see that you are born of my bones your flesh let me first think about it that they have already accepted it but they have pretended and when the man knows that she will accept anyway this is true [Music] that [Applause] when we believe that i'll just take one minute in this one just like adam adam he woke up from breath this young man here um amen i thought it's always good to type the spirit on the physical yes [Laughter] and the young lady did not run away and so they want to announce their engagement engagement here should you not rejoice and be happy for them amen hallelujah you were engaged yesterday um but then she's she's uh and then i saw he came amen praise the name of the lord become a muslim but the air frame will be in brother robert's church on sunday for them to announce the engagement there brother brother robertson preparations is almost done with college with the university of madison university he's working i call her the young lady you may think she's in a senior too but actually when we were still in ethiopia she was standing there and she got done with education how do they call it do they call it aeronautic engineering or what what is that called aircraft maintenance and engineering yes so she repairs airplanes you know if these people mess up the plane if it is flying in the air you can easily crash that means that's a very important role they play a caller and so this is exactly how it was so watch the way charlie give me more minutes okay is that okay some people just arrived give me 30 more minutes and so i was speaking on the reason why jesus came so before we talk about why he came i want us to look to look at the verse we looked at yeah in revelation 12. verse quickly now because i'm saving my time i'm trying to keep up the time of request okay so we get to the next part of jesus and there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragonfold and his angels [Applause] it because we know that jesus was only a manifestation of god on earth yes you see but we know that god never mind now manifests himself in many ways yeah there is someone getting ancient so we say that michael jordan was only a representation of god in the angelic realm and so we see that when lucifer electron lucifer the one is calling the dragon he was one of the angels in heaven he was great amen amen and so we find out and i want to teach that michael timothy was an english what you are the interpreter so you have to find the word [Applause] hallelujah [Music] he cannot be disputed came down already he's fighting [Applause] from heaven [Applause] foreign yes together but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it probably anger god will require foreign a man marries reflects his character and his ambition how he wants his future home to pay yes [Music] hallelujah and so when [Music] at the church of jesus christ of christ the heart is original the and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit they are off and did it and gave old son to the husband with her and he did it the tree of knowledge is the devil free of knowledge is satan lucifer devil dragon whatever you want to manage eating is hearing oh and the bible says david accepted fostering first doctrines indication many that we always talk about here we need you to be okay that you you you can dress in a way it doesn't matter you see they have arrested horrible because um but i suffer no one is there okay let us begin afresh one two three go but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to accept authority over the man but to be in silence that's why even in a home the man is the head of the home yes together was not deceived before and he became me so that i become himself [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] he became [Music] i surrendered [Music] i one more time everybody [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] now i know in answering one question another one has got to come up and people ask me if he fell that way what did adam do for god lays the blame on adam [Applause] was there exactly as it is written in our bible now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is an adulteress he knew exactly what he was doing [Music] can you imagine [Applause] [Music] that god since all right no hand god bless you all for being honest [Music] oh jesus will never leave he is [Music] [Laughter] [Music] he will never leave me alone he's with me [Music] [Music] oh the love of jesus christ nothing can separate me from ours i was predestinated before the foundation of the world want to finish this quote and then quit but i want to give me a few more moments here listen he says brother give it to me again what it is [Music] he says he says if a woman she was a part of him and said yeah and then he says you will not let your question if conceived by him adam he knew she could yamanya are sober he knew exactly what would happen to the human race sure and he saw the human race into sin that he might have adam praise the name of the lord amen eve was guilty evil are you single adam had all reason to put her away [Music] [Music] i want to show you the hallelujah amen the bible says in the book of genesis 3 8. and they had a voice now [Applause] i also have someone uh i have come to seek that he also had his head i don't matter he came seeking for him he came looking for him [Music] is the world can do what they want to do that's why amen that's right it's not a move of mine in the same time wherever they are one when everybody they will respond hallelujah amen i would still preach more but let me finish this letter i'm so glad that they found me [Applause] that's why others rejoice and jump because it's joy unspeakable with my heart flowing someday i'm going to negotiate someday i'm going to i'm so glad he found me with love he found me put his arms around me [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] [Music] one is time know [Music] streets oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for one minute [Music] is is [Music] my hope is [Applause] [Music] [Music] is glory [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] ah oh i [Music] i fly away [Music] glory ah [Music] [Music] so glad [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] i'm one of them is [Applause]
