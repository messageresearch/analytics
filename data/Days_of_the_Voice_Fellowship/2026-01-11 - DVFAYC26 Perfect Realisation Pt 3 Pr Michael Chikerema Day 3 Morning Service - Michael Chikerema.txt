Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many are feeling happy this morning? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is a day of climaxes. I feel that many of us have already uh taken our blessing. So, we just reaffirming it. Amen. Yesterday was wonderful. Amen. Was a wonderful day. Ah, the last preacher made me lose my voice. Man, pray. Pastor Tasha is a preaching machine. God bless you, Pastor. And all our precious brother that have ministered, we say, "God, the ministers, God bless you." Amen. And so uh brother from Ethiopia uh ministered this morning and uh he while I speak these few words if my family and a few others if you could come because okay I don't have much of any voice left but there's a song I wanted us to sing. I don't know if we could still do it. We can pray as we usher in the word this morning. So brother shared a little bit of his testimony saw ministered uh the word to us this morning. Was it not wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was really wonderful. &gt;&gt; And so this morning we have one last lap with brother Michael. &gt;&gt; Amen. as uh I I spoke to you yesterday, I just wanted to rehearse it to you this morning. Um Pastor Michael. Yes. Thank you. You can just stand there and wait. And others could come as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so uh don't concentrate on them. Concentrate on what I'm saying. He broke the ice &gt;&gt; and and so I was saying that Pastor Michael uh is a busy man just like all the other preachers. He's a very busy man and you are not concentrating on what I'm saying. I said he's a busy man. And so to get him to come here even to begin to give an invitation, it was by faith not knowing whether he will accept. Uh I mean he still I have proposed to him he should resign at the place of work and concentrate on the ministry full time. But uh nonetheless, he's still he's still working full-time and full-time ministry. And uh and I think brother Josh would agree with me, Pastor Michael has one of the biggest churches in Australia. And like he told us here, you know, it has it's a multinational church and I did not know him. &gt;&gt; But when brother Gary Walker invited me to Australia, &gt;&gt; he set me up to visit a few places. Brother Michael's place was one of those and we just kind of struck a very good connection and he's a real man of God. He has blessed us. And um if the Lord tries, we would want you to come back again. Amen. Sure enough. Sure enough. I believe that this is just one of the many Amen. one of the many visits. And and so um after here he will be going to Kenya. &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac is going to be carrying his itinerary there. And so if you want to know where he's going to be, brother is the man. So you can follow him up and attend the meetings there because I'm sure the few meetings he has preached here is not enough. We need more. Amen. Are there others joining us? Come on, brothers. You can't leave this to us. come. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll come down. I'll come. Honestly, we didn't practice this. We've sung it before in the church, but we do not practice it now. So, we sang it a long time ago. So, we we we don't know really how it will go. And my voice is broken up. So, I'm giving a lot of disclaimers, but my daughters and sons will help. Amen. Who wasn't a piano last time? Was it you? Was it Shem? Who is Shem? Brother, brother promise is one of the good pianists. How many appreciate brother promise? Amen. He too can do a good job and and um can you get on the organ, please? Amen. This is just we're not going to really sing for you. We're going to worship together as we usher in the the ministry of the word this morning. I know this song, we all know it, but I don't know if you have the word. Psalms 34. Uh I sought the Lord and he answered me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd like us to sing it together. If you can get the words, that's fine. This one probably needs a microphone. He always But he doesn't need a microphone because he has the highest voice usually. Amen. I'll just I'll just stand here. I sought the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from every fear.

I would like to greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I count it a grand privilege to be here and I feel honored to stand before you this morning. I had not been to East Africa before. So this is my first time in East Africa and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Like I told you yesterday, I'm home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh it's been a pleasure. Of course, I've not managed to greet every hand, shake every hand that's here. And if I be honest, as a Christian, I can't remember all your names, but I know your faces, and I want you to know I love you all. Amen. Amen. And uh well, brother Bas said a few things here that could make even an African man blush. You know, &gt;&gt; you know, some of these things we didn't plan on them. We we never grew up to want to be pastors and ministers and and all these things. &gt;&gt; And many time we are as surprised as you are surprised. that we are where we are and we are doing what we are doing. Amen. So we we we but we at the same time accept the responsibility the Lord has given us and we just like this morning at breakfast we were just making the brothers laugh as we were sharing our our boyhood experiences. Praise the Lord. So, like I did mention, me and Rev, we share the same spiritual grooming and for probably over 20 years, we've operated in very different spheres. But every time someone hears you preach or you interact with them, they'll be asking, "Do you know brother?" And I'm sure it's been the same with him. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we call each other and say, "Brother, I'm getting sick and tired of this thing." And we laugh about it. Amen. But we've never shared meetings. We've never shared meetings in all our boyhood years. I think we've shared some first street preaching. when we were young boys preaching on the streets of Arar. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that was the last time we kind of preached along the same way. The Lord led him this way. I was led that way. But we've never been under pressure to take the same meeting. But inwardly we knew that at some point we will have to come together again and take some meetings. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God had to use our precious brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you say it right? brother, brother Tenua to bring us together in the form of meetings. &gt;&gt; So it's an experience to cherish also been good to come with brother Joshua &gt;&gt; a young bing minister from the land of the kangaroos. Amen. So he kind of &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he represents uh the generation that is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it's a privilege to share this experience with him. &gt;&gt; It's his experience first time in Africa. Praise the Lord. So, I'm sure it's quite an experience. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things to take in. A lot of things to take in. A lot of things to adjust to. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm just watching him and laughing cuz I know Australia &gt;&gt; and Australians. &gt;&gt; He's a good missionary. He &gt;&gt; is a good missionary. He he's he's doing well. He sometimes he turning red in the face but he's hanging in there. So we appreciate the Lord. Amen. And so certainly want to I'll take this opportunity to do one naughty thing. I want to really appreciate the host uh brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I really appreciate his vision for the young people to invest much in the generation that's coming up. Hallelujah. Certainly want to appreciate that and appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this. And I want to appreciate all the pastors that are here or that have allowed their people to come and be here. Certainly appreciate that cooperation and it's been a pleasure to minister to you all. Amen. I want to appreciate the ministers which are many then pastors that would have taken these meetings but they have preferred us. So we want to appreciate them and acknowledge them as men of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I will take this opportunity as well to appreciate all the sisters that are married to these brothers, to these ministers, to these pastors that are married to the deacons. that are married to the trustees, that are married to the brothers that are running around in the past week. They have not seen their husbands. Their children have not seen their daddies. They come after midnight and they leave before 6:00 a.m. So they are as much a part of the ministry as we all are. And I want to salute you all sisters. May the Lord richly bless you. Praise the Lord. And the Lord who sees your sacrifices will not forget it. I pray for abundant blessings on you. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I want to also acknowledge a precious friend. A brother who was an older brother to us in college, brother Patrick. Brother, if you can give us a wave. &gt;&gt; That brother there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was an emotional reunion with him yesterday. There are people you meet in college, in life and you love them deeply and they play a very key role. They are very supportive. They live a Christian life before you. You pray together. You confess to one another. you lay hands on each other. That is one of those brothers. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I really appreciate that brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm sure he appreciates what the Lord has done in our lives. And I'm sure it's also a blessing for him to see us travel the world and serve the Lord in the way that we are doing. And I see hasn't changed. So I appreciate that. I think I've done all the protocol. It's taken me close to 10 minutes to do that. Let's get into the word. How many are still expecting? Amen. Amen. And I should not forget the next phase of my African trip. Let me start to pave the way right. Special greetings to my Kenyan brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. Cuz I know that's where I'm going. So, you know, you lay the groundwork so that they can treat you right. Brother Isaac is a great man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jude chapter one. &gt;&gt; The book of Jude chapter one &gt;&gt; and we start from verse 17. &gt;&gt; I don't know the cameramen yesterday. They were a bit naughty. They kept they kept the cameras rolling when we were really picking up some serious dances. Yeah, unfortunately with this world, digital world, the images went very far to a big continent and the people saw the pastor dancing. He had reconnected with the African in him. All the African moves came out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And all the Polished stuff went out the window. &gt;&gt; But God is good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jude chapter one starting from verse 17. But beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. These be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit. But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. and of some have compassion making a difference. And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise God our Savior be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The grass fadeth, wither, the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand forever. The Lord had blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated saints. Praise the Lord. I've tried to stay on track on a thought that is really precious to me which is the thought of perfect realization. And every minister understands that there seasons when the Lord places something upon your heart and you get this perspective on a thought, you get this other perspective on the same thought. You get this other perspective on the same thought. And when you look at your notes and what you've been preaching in the recent past, you realize that unconsciously you've been preaching basically around the same areas. And sometimes you take your time to look around, you realize that that same thought and that same channel, the Lord is also dealing with other ministers along the same and you start to realize that it's like the spirit is making something an emphasis on this to his bride. Praise the Lord. Amen. And so this is a thought that has been very close to me and I've preached quite a number of subjects on it and I've just tried to put together what agrees with the theme and as the Lord I felt the Lord leading me and I'm thankful to God that uh I felt I connected with his spirit to deliver the message so far. And I pray the same for this morning. And I don't want you to worry if you see me try to slow down a bit and you fear that I'm going to preach too long. If it happens, it's not by design. Amen. I tend to preach my usual no more times. Praise the Lord. But it's something that I feel as I come now to the last service that I have to take in these meetings, I bring this thought. acknowledging the work that the Lord has done through the other ministers as well that have ministered in this convention. I think it's been precious what's been planted in us. Praise the Lord. How we have spoken talking about how men lost his relationship from the garden and as a result of losing his relationship. He then became disconnected from his channel of blessing, authority, protection and all these other things. And I prophet in the message fundamental foundation for faith. It says here now that is the beginning of man. That's what God gave him power over everything on the earth. Now through the fall he lost that power. Then he becomes unconscious of the FACT after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father. He lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through. Now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that. Now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again. So when sin entered the garden sin caused a separation it man lost his relationship and friendship and fellowship with God. And as a result, he lost his CONSCIOUSNESS to who he was. He became unconscious to his rightful position as a son of God. Are we together? And by losing that conscious, the prophet says his great CHANNELS got clogged up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They were trying to fix up our water situation by the residences there because the water pressure just wasn't enough and the plumbers had to come and attend to the fault and there's many reasons for that and sometimes the reason is that the piping is clogged up. Some foreign material has entered into the channel of water and is restricted now the water flow to go where it's supposed to go. And the only way you can fix it is to come and remove the foreign material AND CLEAN IT OUT. SO THAT THE WATER CAN now flow. And the prophet is saying when man lost his relationship with God, HIS CHANNELS that connected him to GOD AND allowed all these great things that made him a true son of God. Now remember in the church ages I have to drop this even though I'm running away I'm running ahead of myself. In the church ages, the prophet really takes his time to EXPLAIN that Jesus is the true light. Does not mean that trueeness. The word truth there does not mean that it is void of a lie. When he says, "I'm the true bread," he's not trying to say, "I'm not lying. I'm telling you the truth." But it's got a deeper meaning. It is him standing IN A POSITION OF perfect realization AND DECLARING THAT I am the light. HE'S NOT SAYING IT TO GO contrary to lies. It's a part of it, but it's a deeper meaning. It's a being standing in perfect realization and saying I am. THAT'S WHY YOU saw I used that term. The channels WERE CLOGGED and the the clogging of the CHANNELS THEN AFFECTED ADAM from being conscious of him being a true son of God. So in other words, as long as the channels are closed, he could not be a true son of God in the sense that he lost himself the perfect realization that he was a son of God. That's why the things that happened in the garden happened. That's why they could cover themselves WITH FIG LEAVES. THAT'S WHY HE WAS AVOIDING the presence of God. He had lost his connection, his relationship. Therefore, he was now in a state of amnesia. Praise the Lord. And for him to be restored back, God had to carry out a work. And that work would be to unclog the channels and re-establish an unrestricted connection between himself and his son and all this consciousness would come back again. Are we together in the message? What was the Holy Ghost given for? Amen. The prophet in paragraph 32 he says Christ poured himself into the church. Therefore now watch at that day you will know that I am in the father and you are in me and I am in you. At that day you know it for the whole thing is one plan of redemption coming down that God coming back to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning. Now then, as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions, gets his church to a place WHERE HE CAN FLOW himself through and love and persuade and fellowship. Then there will come an Eden. He will TAKE HIS CHURCH BACK TO WHERE it left him at back to an Eden again. There it fell. That's where it made its first start OR FALL. THERE IS where it will be taken right BACK with every clean slate of redemption, bringing them straight back to that place again. That's the whole plan of redemption. God is trying to bring his church back to the speaking condition. to to a place where he himself WOULD FLOW THROUGH AND LOVE AND PERSUADE through his people. So the plan of redemption is to unclog the channels, the supernatural channels. Hallelujah. SO THAT GOD CAN START TO FREELY FLOW and be able to love, to fellowship. Are we together? AMEN. WITH MEN AGAIN THROUGH MEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? AMEN. IS IN THAT FIRST JOHN WHEN HE SAYS IF WE SHARE WITH YOU THESE MYSTERIES then we have fellowship with one another. BUT ACTUALLY OUR FELLOWSHIP IS NOT BETWEEN YOU AND I BUT IT is between you and God. Because now God is freely flowing through MY SISTER, THROUGH MY BROTHER AND FLOWING also through my other brother AND MY OTHER SISTER. AND AS they meet together, THEN GOD IS FLOWING THROUGH AND IT IS GOD FELLOWSHIPPING WITH GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; now? WE'VE GOT TO CATCH THAT. SO, man lost that consciousness and he lost his connection to the celestial and he became too conscious to the terrestrial. He lost his sensitivity to the spiritual And really God so connected to the NATURAL and education is training the NATURAL making the natural mind think in a certain way. Culture and tradition is training the natural man. TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THEIR NATURAL SELF. YOUR parents will tell you you are of the Minga tribe. YOU ARE OF THIS TRIBE. We this people, our totem is the crocodile. Our totem is the monkey. We should act LIKE A MONKEY IN A CERTAIN WAY. THEY ARE GRILLING IN YOU, training your natural SELF TO START TO THINK IN A CERTAIN WAY. ARE WE TOGETHER? OH, WE ARE THE BIG ANIMAL. Our totem is the elephant and the people are groomed like that. AND YOU START TO see in the village they start to treat everybody like they are SMALL PEOPLE. OH, OUR TRIBE IS RIGHT at the top level of the pyramid. Don't ever marry from THIS OTHER TRIBE. THEY are not good people. DON'T MARRY FROM THAT TRIBE. THEY ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. WOMEN FROM THAT VILLAGE, THEY ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. EVEN IF THEY ARE BELIEVERS, DON'T MARRY FROM THAT VILLAGE. THEY ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. It is the natural MIND being trained in the culture and tradition of humanity. ARE WE TOGETHER? THE CHANNELS OF GOD, THEY ARE CLOGGED UP AND THE MUSCLES, natural muscles, NATURAL MENTAL MUSCLES ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND CONSCIENTIZED AND TRAINED TO THINK in a certain way. That's why this prophet spoke so much against education. It's not because he promoted ignorance, but he realized that damage that education could do. Because an educated man wants to reason things out, wants to think things through with his natural mind. SO EDUCATION HELPS FURTHER CLOG up the CHANNELS so that a man is not connected spiritually to his maker but is more connected to his natural faculties. But God wants to flow through you. And through you, my sister and have fellowship with you and have fellowship with the other sister. And he wants to do it through you. And it is through that fellowship that God restores Eden again. He is working by his word to restore us to the place where man was perfectly conscious that he was a son of God. That his thoughts were the thoughts of God. That what he spoke was God speaking. That the place where God wants to take us to. Amen. Amen. First Corinthians chapter 2. Verse 9. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. But as it is written, I had not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of men the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man? save the spirit of man which is in him. Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God, which things also we speak, not in the words which men's wisdom teacheth, But which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual, but the natural man receiveth not that things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things. Yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. No natural man. No matter how intelligent they are is able to discern the spiritual things. You are you have to know that. You are not going TO FEEL in the natural. And because of the feeling in THE NATURAL THEN YOU ARE ABLE TO DISCERN SPIRITUAL THINGS. You are not going to REASON IN THE natural and ADD THIS AND THAT AND COME UP WITH that conclusion in the natural mind and design correctly the things of God. Because the NATURAL MIND AND THIS natural body without the spirit is clogged up. Are we together? So the only way you can discern SPIRITUAL THINGS IS by the spirit of God which BRINGS THE MIND OF CHRIST INTO the individual. Hallelujah. Romans chapter 8. Oh, don't worry. You think I'll start preaching? I'm preaching right now. If you are tying your shoelaces is waiting for the moment, you might miss it because next thing you hear me closing. Now if you are busy tying up your shoelaces, tucking up your shirt, straightening up so that now when he comes to the interesting part now my eyes can open up you might miss it because I'm preaching RIGHT NOW. I'm not jumping but I am preaching. And he who had the spirit will hear what the spirit is saying. Are we together? Because we need to know where we are standing and we need to take everything that we have been taught in this convention and be able to rightly apply it. The problem is we live in a microwave age. We live in an instant instant noodles. There's there's the brand of noodles that is world famous. What is that? &gt;&gt; Indomi. That's right. Praise the Lord. We live in the world of instant noodles. We live in the age of instant coffee. We live in the age of microwaves. One minute. It is steaming. Then you eat it. We live in an age where test cricket is losing popularity because people don't have the patience to sit for three days watching one single match. These are the years of T20 cricket &gt;&gt; knock the ball OUT OF THE STADIUM. IN TWO HOURS the match is finished. These are the days of fast cars. &gt;&gt; 300 horsepower, powerful machines that can travel. These are the days of supersonic travel. People used to take months and months to travel across the seas to reach another continent. BUT NOW BY JET TRAVEL, you can call them in the morning and tell them that please prepare supper. I'm going to be home. AND AS SURE AS anything by the evening time, you are seated with your family. having supper. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT that whole MENTALITY start to filter through to our minds and we think God is also moving at the same pace. You think God is going to microwave you. You think God is going to instant coffee you. Are we together? This is the DAY WHEN people can't wait to get married. THEY CAN'T WAIT ALREADY. WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG TEENAGERS, they know NOTHING ABOUT LIFE. THEY ARE ALREADY thinking of boys, already thinking of girls. They have NO JOB, NO MONEY, NO HOUSE, NO FUTURE. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF A FAMILY. THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHARACTER, BUT THEY WANT TO GET MARRIED. Are we together? Young people, give me an amen. You see that that's that's a danger &gt;&gt; and people don't want even young MINISTERS &gt;&gt; do not want to sit under leadership. They they just HAVE A LITTLE GIFT AND THEY GET APPRECIATED BY THE PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR own church. THEY THEY START TO WALK LIKE A PEACOCK. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO PASTOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY HAVE NOT been pastored themselves. &gt;&gt; It is the blind leading the blind, no experience, no experience, no revelation, NO CHARACTER. BUT PEOPLE WANT TO BELIEVE IT. ARE WE TOGETHER? But we have TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THE FAITH TO KNOW THAT THE THINGS OF GOD, THE BIBLE SAYS, GOD COULD HAVE TAKEN THEM BY THE WAY OF PHILISTINE to the promised land. ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT HE CHOSE TO TAKE THEM THROUGH THE WILDERNESS. OH, &gt;&gt; church is no monkeyastics. Church is no DISCO where you say DJ give us &gt;&gt; church IS THE PLACE WHERE EVEN IF YOU are a company director, you come to an uneducated pastor and he tells you to sit down. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; CHURCH IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU MAY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY and the pastor is wearing shoes that that have got the toes STICKING OUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WITH THOSE SHOES KICKING OUT LIKE THIS, HE TELLS YOU TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR CROCODILE SKIN SHOES AND LISTEN to a word. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We live in a microwave age. BUT GOD HAS GOT A BRIDE. HALLELUJAH. God has got a bride. She's not caught by the spirit of the age. She has character. She has patience. She has virtue. She's no ski milk. She's tough. She doesn't need a greenhouse and be sprayed up and temperature increased. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's tough. She can stand pressure. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. SHE'S STRONG. SHE CAN BE REBUKED AND NEXT SUNDAY COME BACK TO CHURCH. Not these people that are rebuked THIS TIME AND THEY STOP COMING TO CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Oh brother, GOD NEEDS TOUGH PEOPLE. COME RAIN, COME SHOES OR NO SHOES, I WILL WORSHIP my God. Oh, you may be seated, saints. You may be seated, saints. You are getting me in a straight I don't want to get to too soon. You don't know how many times I prayed in my room. Lord, don't get me get carried away. Don't allow me to get carried away. Amen. I'm not used to this level of energy. So, you trigger too much the African in me. You see me standing on this building. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've done it before. I was preaching at a shopping mall. The next minute I was on top of somebody, stepped on HIS CAR TO HIM AND AFTER I PREACHED TO HIM, HE SHOOK MY HEAD, THANK YOU. BECAUSE IT WAS THE SPIRIT THAT TOOK ME THERE. Because if it is excitement, you can receive the five-fold ministry. Don't work on excitement. You lose your teeth. They will rearrange your frankly the infallible proof of the resurrection. The sin questions is settled. When the Holy Spirit comes into the human heart, it casts down reasoning, it goes above our intellectual approach. NOW today the reason so many ups and downs and things enter the religious PEOPLE is because there's an intellectual conception of Christ. In other words, it's in their mind, not in their heart. You see they just mentally believe it and your mental will reason. Could it be so? Could divine healing be so? Could the baptism of the spirit be so? Now that's intellectual reason. BUT WHEN that comes into the heart, IT'S A FAITH. IT'S a positive. There is no question at all about it. It's all settled forever. It's in your heart and your heart doesn't reason because it's the throne. Where is that? Where is that? THE DWELLING PLACE of the almighty heart. So you can have a CONCEPTION of what is being PREACHED is a mental conception. THE WORD CONCEPTION THE PROPHET uses it a lot and I know you might know it and the architect amongst us would explain it better but A CONCEPT IS THE FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK on which you build everything. ARE WE TOGETHER? OR A CONCEPT OF THIS WALL THE FOUNDATIONAL DRAWING GIVES THIS BUILDING DIMENSIONS IT LAYOUT AND THEN ALL THE OTHER FINER DETAILS come after the CONCEPT THE FINER DETAILS SO IF YOU HAVE A WRONG CONCEPT, YOU CANNOT get the final details. SO YOUR CONCEPT HAS GOT TO BE RIGHT. THE FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK IS HAS GOT TO BE RIGHT. THE FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK HAS GOT TO BE AND THEN YOU BUILD ON IT. IF YOU HAVE A MENTAL CONCERN, YOU ARE GOING TO CONSTRUCT A MENTAL STRUCTURE the righteousness of God. IF YOUR CONCEPT IS A REVELATION CONCEPTUAL CONCEPT CAN STAND PRESIST, if I was to come and give each one of you a blank piece of paper and say, "My sister, here's a blank piece of paper. My brother, here's another one. My brother, there's another one. My brother, there's another." And I would give you an array of colored pencils. And I would ask EACH ONE OF YOU TO draw what you think God looks like. ARE we together? Do you know how many pictures? THREE CREATURES that that we would get. Are we together? It would be hard for you to draw a god who looks like a kangaroo because there's no kangaroo. And you might draw something that looks like a monkey because you you you have seen monkey. YOU MAY DRAW SOMETHING THAT looks like a green because you have seen it. And so your CONCEPT IS informed by what you know. And the choice OF COLORS WOULD BE INFORMED BY THE colors that you know. You are not going to pick COLORS YOU DON'T KNOW AND PICK VIOLET VIOLET and where did you SEE THEM? YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE COLORS THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU LEAVE AROUND YOU DRAW WHATEVER you draw because it's informed by your environment. ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT GOD IS NOT LIKE THAT. YOU CANNOT catch him with your natural mind. WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES TO PRAY, WHAT IS THE PICTURE THAT COMES TO YOU? I WOULD LIKE TO think you imagine something. It can be blank like that. When you pray, do you SEE BLANK LIKE THAT? OR IN YOUR HEAD SOMETHING COMES UP THIS IMAGE THAT YOU HAVE CREATED. BUT WHEN YOU IN THE DEPTH OF PRAYER, YOU START TO SEE THAT MAYBE YOU SEE YOURSELF WALKING AND YOU'RE A VERY SMALL PERSON STANDING IN FRONT OF A big God. WITH WHITE HAIR, BLUE EYES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE missionaries told him. Does he have hair like YOUR HAIR? OH, HE has flowing hair because that's the pictures you GREW UP LOOKING AT ALL YOUR LIFE. YOUR GOD CANNOT LOOK LIKE AN AFRICAN. THOSE ARE NOT THE PICTURES YOU GREW UP SEEING. YOU WERE BRAINWASHED TO think God looks a certain way. His hair is a certain way. HIS NOSE IS A CERTAIN WAY. HIS LIPS ARE A CERTAIN WAY. WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES? You're going quiet on me now. You're going QUIET TO ME NOW. I'M GOING TO RUB IT IN. &gt;&gt; I'm going TO RUB IT IN. YOU SEE, WHATEVER YOU ARE IMAGINING, LET me tell you today is a mental concept. IT'S INFORMED BY SO MANY THINGS AND NONE SOMETIMES NONE OF THOSE THINGS. IS CORRECTION. IT'S PROPAGANDA, is indoctrination, is brainwashing. WHATEVER YOU ARE BUILDING IS A CONGLOMERATION OF YOUR OWN PERCEPTION AND COMPLEXES, superiority complex, INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND WHATEVER ELSE IS IN BETWEEN. FORMS THAT IMAGE. GOD IS GREATER SINGER THAN YOUR MENTAL CONCEPTION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE TRYING TO IMAGINE GOD with your natural mind. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE GOT THE godhead wrong like WAS PREACHED LAST NIGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND GOD WITH THE NATURAL MIND. YOU CANNOT YOU NEED THE SPIRIT the proof of his resurrection and MAN IN HIS OWN MENTAL WAY OF THINK is wrong TO BEGIN WITH. HE is an alien to God. YOU AND I, YOU AND I AS NATURAL HUMAN BEING IN OUR OWN MENTAL WAY OF THINKING is wrong TO BEGIN WITH AND IT IS ALIEN TO GOD. IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS NOTHING like God. HE IS CUT OFF WITHOUT hope without God, without mercy. AND THE ONLY THING THAT HE CAN DO IS COME TO accept Christ. AND THEN THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES IN AND THE MIND THAT WAS IN CHRIST IS in you. JESUS SAID, "THE FATHER THAT SENT ME is with me." Oh my, what a declaration. WHAT A WORD. A FATHER THAT SENT ME COME WITH ME. LISTEN. AND AS GOD SENT ME, SO DO I send you. HE DON'T ONLY SEND YOU, BUT HE GOES WITH YOU. I'LL be with you. EVEN IN IT UNTO THE END OF THE WORLD THAT WAS IN GOD. ALL THAT WAS IN GOD WAS POURED OUT IN CHRIST AND ALL THAT WAS EMPTIED OUT INTO THE RIVER THE CHURCH. GOD IS WITH YOU. OH, I AM WITH YOU even to the END OF THE WORLD. THAT'S THE DECLARATION OF GOD'S WORD. WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS, THAT'S WHAT I believe. Amen. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WITHOUT THE SPIRIT WHICH BRINGS THE MIND OF CHRIST, IN THE NATURAL MAN you can be pious, you can BE ZEALOUS. YOU CAN BE HAPPY. YOU CAN SHOUT. YOU CAN OPERATE. YOU CAN PREACH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU HAVE A WRONG OF GOD AND A WRONG CONCEPT OF GOD. ONLY GO SO FAR. ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT A RIGHT CONCEPT YOU ALL. AMEN. Philippians chapter 2 verse 5. Let this mind BE IN YOU WHICH was also IN CHRIST JESUS. WHO BEING IN THE FORM OF GOD, thought it not ROBBERY TO BE equal with God, BUT MADE HIMSELF OF NO REPUTATION, AND TOOK UPON HIM THE FORM OF A SERVANT, AND WAS MADE IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN, AND BEING FOUND IN FLESH AS A MAN, LIKE YOU AND I, HE HUMBLED himself and became OBEDIENT UNTO DEATH. EVEN THE death of the cross, he became obedient UNTO DEATH. NOT JUST AN ORDINARY DEATH, BUT THE DEATH OF THE CROSS, A VIOLENT DEATH AND ROMAN CAPITAL. SHAME. SHAMED BEFORE THE PEOPLE, CRUCIFIED LIKE A COMMON CRIMINAL TAKEN CLOTHES OFF, CLOTHES TAKEN OFF, NAKED ON THE CROSS BEFORE HIS DISCIPLES. HE DID NOT THINK OF IT AS PROPER TO BE EQUAL WITH GOD. HE COULD HUMBLE HIMSELF. HALLELUJAH. HIMSELF AND DIE THE DEATH EVEN THE DEATH OF THE CROSS. THAT'S no natural man. AMEN. MIND OF CHRIST. THEREFORE, GOD ALSO HAS highly exalted HIM AND GIVEN HIM A NAME WHICH IS ABOVE EVERYTHING THAT AT THE NAME OF JESUS EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW IN HEAVEN AND THINGS AND THINGS AND THAT EVERY TONGUE SHOULD CONFESS. I PRAY THAT JESUS CHRIST IS LORD TO THE GLORY OF THE LORD. HE IS WALKING IN A PLACE OF PERFECT REALIZATION THAT HE IS EQUAL WITH GOD. THERE'S NO SHADOW OF DOUBT EVEN IN HIM THAT HE IS EQUAL WITH GOD. AND YET EVEN WITH THAT REALIZATION THERE'S NO PRIDE IN HIM. THERE'S NO POMPOUSNESS IN HIM. THERE'S NO AIR ABOUT YOU. HE CAN HUMBLE HIMSELF TO THE LOWEST CRIMINALS TO THE LOWEST OF SINNERS. HE CAN LIVE AS IF HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HIS FINGER. HE CAN CALL THE ARMIES OF HEAVEN AND DESTROY EVERYTHING. HE CAN LOOK DOWN ALLOW ROMAN SOLDIERS UNGODLY SINNERS TO HIT HIM ON THE HEAD TO PUSH HIM AROUND AND HUMBLY WALK IN THE HUMBLY WALK WITHOUTATION. EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS HE IS GOD IN FLESH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, if it is some of our brothers and sisters, they are going to say, "You pushed me too far. You pushed me too far." Brother says, "You closed the line." That's right. From now you will look like a gorilla. How we together? You have a tail like a baboon. But his purpose was more important. THAN political point scoring. Now that's the mind of Christ. That is being like Jesus. He knew who he was when he went to the cross. In the book of John, he makes so many declarations before his crucifixion. Do you LOVE TO READ THE BIBLE? LET'S READ SOME OF THE DECLARATIONS. BROTHERS, if you help me with the projector, we want to have a snapshot of THE BOOK OF JOHN. JOHN CHAPTER 6 verse 35. Jesus said unto them, I AM the bread OF LIFE, HE that cometh to me shall never hunger. And he that believeth on me SHALL NEVER THIRST. JOHN CHAPTER 8 verse 12. Then Jesus spake again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world. YE that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, BUT SHALL have the light of life. The Pharisees therefore SAID UNTO HIM, "THOU BEAREEST RECORD of thyself, thy record is NOT TRUE." The Pharisees GOT TIRED of the Lord Jesus Christ humbly declaring his position. And just like with any human being, if someone stands here and say I'm a true son of God, if I would have come and stood here and my first statement would have been, YOU SEE ME THE WAY I AM, I am a man of God. Some of you would have walked out. This is coming with an attitude man of God. Come on. It's human attitude. Amen. WE RESENT PEOPLE who are too sure of themselves. WE HUMAN BEINGS RESENT PEOPLE WHO ARE too sure of themselves. I will tell you I'm A PASTOR pastoring a lot of PEOPLE OF different social CLASSES and educational qualifications. Sometimes for someone TO CALL ME PASTOR, IT'S LIKE THEY are swallowing a golf ball. Pastor or they will never say my pastor. Oh Lord, bless the pastor of this church. The pastor of this church. I'm I'm just sitting AND PRIDE. They can't say God bless OUR PASTOR. GOD BLESS my pastor. It's too much for them. &gt;&gt; Our the liberty to say it. I'm away from home. But people have got big heads. They are improper fractions. The Pharisees were OFFENDED when the Lord Jesus Christ was declaring his position. If the PASTOR COMES AND STANDS AND HE SAYS THIS is the vision that I have vision whose VISION they said to Moses, you think too much of yourself. Are you the ONLY MAN OF GOD HERE? YOU THINK THOSE ATTITUDES STARTED TODAY? People die but spirits don't die. PEOPLE DIE AND ARE DEAD. BUT THEY ARE SPIRITS ARE STILL HERE. I I I don't know if I will have MY LUNCH TODAY. PRAISE THE LORD. Do you know that's the reason why tithe paying is now a problem? THAT'S THE REASON people no longer believe in paying. Pay tithe to who? Yeah. Oh, THE MAN OF GOD. WHO'S not a man of God? WHO WHO IS NOT A MAN OF GOD? I'M GOING TO TAKE MY TITHES AND I'M GOING TO GIVE TO THE POOR. I'M GOING TO TAKE MY TITHE AND I'M GOING TO HELP THE POOR PEOPLE. NOT THAT PASTOR WHO'S driving a nice car. ARE WE TOGETHER? YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT HAS always been a revelation. TITHE WERE PAID. BEFORE THE LAW of Moses. THE FIRST PERSON TO PAY TIED BY REVELATION in the correct way. THE LAW OF MOSES CAME TO AFFIRM THE REVELATION of Abraham. YOU WERE JUMPING WHEN WE WERE TELLING YOU THAT YOU ARE SONS and daughters. YOU WERE JUMPING. NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REVELATION. PAY TI. YOU ARE CLOSING YOUR MOUTH. WHAT YOU SAY? YOU BELIEVE THIS BIBLE FROM COVER TO COVER. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, PRAY FOR ME. &gt;&gt; BUT I'M FEELING good right now. People now believe all kinds of things. They now believe in donating to the church. I donated Oh brothers, God help us. And if you pay your tithes LIKE THAT, I'M NOT speaking to these pastors. I'm not speaking on their behalf. BUT AS FOR ME, IF SOMEONE IS paying tithes without revelation, I don't want them to pay tithes. I don't want THEM TO PAY TITHE. BECAUSE ONE DAY THEY WILL COME WITH a whole print OUT and say, "I finally stopped believing. I need a refund." YEAH. BECAUSE IT'S PAINFUL. GOOD DAY. IF YOU DO IT IN the flesh, LET'S BE HONEST, BROTHERS. LET'S BE HONEST, SISTER. IF YOU DO IT IN THE FLESH, OH, it's painful. IF IN YOUR MIND YOU THINK IT'S MY MONEY THAT I'M GIVING TO THE CHURCH, IF THAT'S HOW YOU PROCESS IT, IT'S GOING TO BE PAINFUL. BUT IF IN YOUR HEART, IT WAS NEVER YOURS. IT IS THE LORD'S MONEY. IN YOUR HEART. IT IS WORSHIP. NOT THE WORSHIP OF THE PERSON, NOT THE WORSHIP OF THE MEN OF THE WORSHIP OF GOD WHO HAS PROVIDED ME AND GIVEN ME HEALTH, GIVEN ME STRENGTH, BLESSED ME, PROMOTED ME, PROSPERED MY BUSINESS. HALLELUJAH. AND IT BLESSED ME. I'M EARNING MONEY FOR I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE NOT MY GOD have nothing to DO WITH THE PASTOR OF GOD. DON'T SERVE THE PASTOR. WHEN I DO ANYTHING FOR THE PASTOR DOING IT for God, that's the correct revelation. God never SAID TO ABRAHAM, "GIVE ME YOUR TITHE." ABRAHAM WENT TO BATTLE 318 SERVANTS AND HE FOUGHT KINGDOM AND HE TRAINED ARMIES AND HE PROSPERED AND HE CONQUERED AND HE WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT MY VICTORY AND NOT BECAUSE OF MY ABILITY THE HAND OF GOD UPON ME. WHAT CAN I DO TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS BLESSING ON ME? WHAT CAN I DO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE'S BEEN WITH ME? ALL THESE THINGS THAT I HAVE SPOILED AS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT IT WAS GOD WILL TAKE 10% AND GIVE UNTO ME THE PRIEST OF THE HIGH REVELATION AND THE WORD DOES NOT CHANGE THE revelation today. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE THE LORD. WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY BELIEVE THE MESSAGE WHERE THEY BELIEVE PORTIONS OF IT. PRAY FOR REVELATION THAT THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND THEY NEVER PRAY FOR DO THE right thing. You may be seated. How How did I get here? Praise the Lord. The Pharisees had a problem with Jesus. They said, "Thou beareest record of thyself, &gt;&gt; your record cannot be true." &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Though I bear record of myself, yet my RECORD IS TRUE. FOR I know when I come and whether I GO, but he cannot tell whence I come and whether I go. He judge after the flesh. I judge no man. YET IF I JUDGE, MY JUDGMENT WOULD BE TRUE. FOR I AM NOT ALONE, BUT I sent me. Ah, &gt;&gt; the Pharisees had a problem. He didn't make it any easy for them. He's telling them more. He says, "I am. I am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine. As the father knoweth me, even so know I the father and I lay down my sheep for the my life for the sheep. Verse 19. There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. Others said, "These are not the words of of him. The devil, can a devil open the eyes of the blind?" John chapter 10 verse 33. It continues. The Jews answered him, saying, "For a good work, we stone thee NOT for blasphemy, and because that thou, thou being a man maketh thyself?" Jesus answered them. Is it not written in your law? I said ye are gods. If he CALLED THEM GOD AND TO whom the word of GOD CAME, THE scripture cannot be broken. Say ye of him whom the father had sanctified into the world, thou blasphe, I am the son of God. Jesus saith unto her. This is John 11:25. &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection and the life. HE THAT BELIEVETH IN ME, THOUGH HE WERE DEAD, YET SHALL he live. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. John 14 verse 5. Jesus saith unto him, &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME. If ye had KNOWN ME YE SHOULD have known my father, AND FROM HENCEFORTH YE know him and have seen him. Hallelujah. How many statements did we read of the Lord Jesus Christ plainly humbly declaring his POSITION DECLARING WHO HE WAS RATHER TO SAY I am the WAY IS TO TELL THE JEWS YOU ARE lost all your ways I'm not correct I am the way LEAVE YOUR TEMPLE LEAVE YOUR ROBES. LEAVE YOUR POSITION. I am the way. It's like the prophet standing in A FULL AUDITORIUM LIKE THIS AUDITORIUM. AND STANDING THERE AND SAYING, I TAKE EVERY SPIRIT UNDER MY CONTROL OF GOD. HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. AND AS HE WAS CONDUCTING PRAYER LIFE AND HIS HUMAN GUARDS, you know how he was guarded as a person, he was careful. So he would ALWAYS TRY TO AVOID TO DECLARE HIS POSITION. BUT UNDER THE ANOINTING, HE WOULD STAND IN THE PRAYER LINE AND ASK THE PEOPLE AND SAY, "DO YOU BELIEVE? I'M GOD'S PROPHET." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS CLEAR ON WHO HE WAS. AND WHEN THE CROSS EYES WERE BEING STUBBORN, HE WOULD SAY BY THE COMMISSION MINISTERED UNTO ME BY AN ANGEL. WHEN I WAS IN GREECE, I SPEAK UNTO YOU. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HE WAS STANDING ON HIS SHORE POSITION, SUREOOTED, BUT HE WAS A PROPHET OF GOD. AND THE ANGEL HAD SAID TO HIM, "NOTHING SHALL STAND BEFORE YOU, NOT EVEN CANCER." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Do you think the prophet was SURPRISED when he was going to pray for King George? Do you think the prophet was surprised when they were coming to him with Cadillacs? the farmers, the Armenians in California who HAD RICH VINEYARDS IN California who WERE VERY RELIGIOUS PEOPLE that that were fleeing RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION in Armenia that had received a revival of the Holy Ghost in Armenia BUT DUE TO PERSECUTION HAD FLEE TO AMERICA. AND GOD PROSPERED THEM. GOD BLESSED THEM. AND THEY HAD RICH VINEYARDS. AND SHAKARIAN FAMILY PEOPLE. ARE WE TOGETHER? And they appreciated THE PROPHET BECAUSE THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUPERNATURAL. THEY COME WITH THEM ALL THE WAY FROM RIGHT THERE BORDERING TURKEY. AND THE USSR and they appreciated THE PROPHET'S MINISTRY AND THEY INVITED HIM INTO GRAND HOMES. DO YOU THINK THE PROPHET WAS SURPRISED WALKING INTO HOMES THAT HAD MARBLE FLOORS? DO YOU THINK HE WAS SURPRISED WHEN THEY WERE BRINGING CADILLACS TO HIS HOUSE? YOU THINK HE WAS SURPRISED? THE ANGEL OF THE LORD HAD TOLD HIM, "YOU SHALL PRAY FOR KINGS. YOU SHALL BE AMONGST THE RICH. THIS GIFT WILL TAKE YOU TO PLACES." HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. THAT'S WHY WHEN THEY BROUGHT THE CADILLAC, HE WOULD SAY, "NO, DON'T WORRY. I don't need it. If we were to give you a Jeep WRANGLER TODAY, &gt;&gt; you will marry a second wife. HE HAD CHARACTER, BUT WHERE DID THE CHARACTER COME FROM? HE HAD PERFECT REVELATION. WHO HE WAS. He finally had a Cadillac and brother George Smith says this is how they ended up giving this Cadillac. He said drive to his house, PARK THE CAR THERE, MOVE THE KEYS in and disappear. BECAUSE THEY KNEW HIM THAT HE HIS character he would tell them don't worry about it. HE WAS NOT TAKEN UP BY MATERIAL THINGS. HE WAS CONSUMED BY HIS PURPOSE. HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. HIS PROTECTION, HIS VICTORY WAS ANCHORED IN HIS PERFECT REALIZATION OF WHO HE WAS. HALLELUJAH. HE COULD NOT GO, CHASING AFTER ALL THE WOMEN THAT WERE SCREAMING HIS NAME. THEY JUST WANTED HIM TO TOUCH THEM FOR A BLESSING. HE COULD NOT BE TAKEN UP HERE BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE WAS GREATER THAN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. HE COULD NOT BE TAKEN UP BY THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE GREATER THAN US. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE COULD NOT BE TAKEN BY THE FULL STADIUMS AND POPULARITY AND POSTERS WITH HIS FACE AND HIS NAMES. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE WAS GREATER THAN US. &gt;&gt; Knowing who you are takes OUT PRIDE. IF YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE BY REVELATION, you know who you are, you don't doubt who you are. And it takes pride out of you. YOU ARE HUMBLE. BUT BEING HUMBLE DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU are not sure. I I'm not going to come and stand here and pretend like I didn't come to preach. I don't know, you know, the brother, you know, this morning. I was having breakfast. Somehow the pastor felt led. I slept with an INTENTION TO PREACH. EVER SAY I prayed that God help me to PREACH AND I FLEW FROM AUSTRALIA TO COME AND PREACH AND I'M PREACHING BECAUSE I BELIEVE GOD HAS GIVEN ME A GIFT TO PREACH. HALLELUJAH. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT ME. IT'S NOT A MISTAKE THAT I'M A PASTOR. THAT I'M A PREACHER. I WAS BORN FOR THAT PURPOSE. I WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT PURPOSE. I CAN PREACH BECAUSE GOD HAS CALLED ME FOR THAT PURPOSE. I'M NOT POSTING. I'M DECLARING MY PURPOSE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of beautiful sisters here. Oh, Uganda is a very pretty women. Some serious black beauties. Of course, my wife is the BEST in case she's watching. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; DON'T THINK I'M NOT SEEING YOU. MY NATURAL EYES, THEY ARE SEEING YOU. THEY SAY THAT SISTER IS THAT SISTER IS ME. BUT MY PURPOSE HAS NO FURTHER CONNECTION TO YOU. MY HANDSHAKE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SAY, "GOD BLESS YOU, SISTER." HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; MY PURPOSE IS GREATER THAN YOUR HALLELUJAH. AMEN. MY PROTECTION IS IN MY PURPOSE. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE THE LORD. I'M NOT SCOUTING AROUND THE CAMP TO SEE HOW I can sneak out AT NIGHT TO GO AND SEE THE SISTERS. I'M LOCKING MY DOOR ADVENTURE. THE devil will inspire a sister. I'M LOCKING MY DOOR. WHEN I TRAVEL TO PREACH, I ASK IF THERE'S a lock. I DON'T WANT THE DEVIL TO INSPIRE A SISTER TO SNEAK INTO MY ROOM. YOU will find the DOOR LOCKED BECAUSE I traveled FOR ONE PURPOSE. PREACH THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. MY PROTECTION IS IN MY PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ONE WIFE, ONE WOMAN, ONE FAMILY BECAUSE I'M A MINISTER OF GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; It's time we close. time will close. Your purpose, THE REVELATION OF IT is your protection. THE REVELATION OF IT IS YOUR BLESSING. THE REVELATION OF IT is your rapturing faith. THE REVELATION OF IT WILL MAKE YOU STAND IN THE DEN OF LIONS. THE REVELATION OF IT WE WILL MAKE YOU STAND IN THE FIERY FURNACE. THE REVELATION OF IT. WE WILL LOOK AT A PIECE OF LAND. EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T have any MONEY IN YOUR LIFE, THE REVELATION OF YOUR PURPOSE, WE SAY, "BROTHERS AND SISTERS, we now NEED OUR OWN CHURCH." AND THAT PIECE OF LAND THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, BUT WE'VE GOT TO BELIEVE GOD THAT HE WILL PROVIDE TO US. IT IS A REALIZATION THAT I'M A PASTOR TO THESE PEOPLE AND YOUR FATHER SHOULD PROVIDE A HOME FOR YOU. IT IS YOUR PURPOSE THAT WILL MAKE A WAY FOR YOU. GOD WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE HOME THAT YOU NEED BECAUSE YOU ARE IN YOUR PURPOSE. YOUR PURPOSE IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN THE CAR. YOUR PURPOSE AS AUNTIE AS A MOTHER WILL STOP A PLANE BECAUSE A MOTHER IS HER POSITION PERFECT REALIZATION POSITION. HALLELUJAH. GLORY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. I KNOW WHO I AM. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHERE IS ELIJAH AND GOD HONORS THAT FAVOR? AND THE PLANE TO SEND ELIJAH TO THE MIGHTY. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Oh my &gt;&gt; time fail us. Help us. Oneness. We are in the end. Oneness. Are you so one with God? That's the way you are going to have to be. Yeah. We are going to have to BE ONE WITH HIM. TILL let the MIND THAT was in Christ be in you. Then Christ his own mind in you WILL RECOGNIZE every word that HE WROTE. it did IN THE APOSTLES rightly dividing the SCRIPTURE which is the truth the Holy Spirit. If it is the truth then he will bear RECORD OF IT BY BRINGING the same sign that he GAVE US same sign he give to Abraham same sign he did by Christ same sign he did by fa We are in the end time. He said that WOULD BE IN THE END TIME. THE CHURCH COLLECTIVELY IS GETTING TOGETHER IN A UNION. ONE here and one there making it up. The spoken word is the original seed. Verse two. Believers of the word. and the spirit must be one. You get it? The congregation says believers the word and the spirit are absolutely one. YOU DON'T DO YOUR OWN THINKING. YOU DON'T USE YOUR OWN MIND. ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL? The mind that was IN CHRIST IS IN YOU. SEE THE MIND IS IN CHRIST AND YOU TAKE THE WORD JUST LIKE HE DID BECAUSE HE WAS the word AND THE MIND OF CHRIST IN YOU. You are the word. YOU ARE GOD'S LIVING WORD REPRESENTATIVES OF HIM HERE ON EARTH. That's right. CONTINUING THE WORK. THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THAT WAY. AND WHEN so the Bible is manifested AGAIN like in the early days of the disciples. Just like the disciple, the Bible is living again. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, When you receive the Holy Ghost, you are born into the kingdom. You are a baby right there. He says the Pentecostals made that mistake. Don't sleep. I'm closing. He says the Pentecostals made that mistake. They thought now that they've received the Bible, they have all of it. But he says that was just the beginning. Says when you receive the baptism, you are a newborn baby. A newborn baby HAS TO GROW. ARE WE TOGETHER? You talk to many young people in the message, they don't know if they have the Holy Ghost or not. And many times the fold is ours ministers because WE CAN PREACH IT in such a way that you will start but when you COME TO THE WORLD when your hands are laid on you when you have the experience that's all of it all your weaknesses are going to all your immaturities going all this is going to falls ship is going to go. Your lust is going to go. You won't even like sisters. If you are a sister, you won't even like brothers. And then after the convention and you see a brother that is really dressed up, nice fresh haircut, LOOKING STRONG AND TALL AND YOU feel a certain way and all the jumping at camp. The amens at camp, THEY ARE DEAD RIGHT THERE. WHY DID I FEEL like this? So I didn't RECEIVE THE BAPTISM. GOD DIDN'T TOUCH ME with that convention. The problem is you have a wrong CONCEPT OF THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. The baptism of the HOLY GHOST IS A BIRTH. YOU ARE BORN A BABY. AND THE HOLY GHOST WILL GUIDE YOU. THE HOLY GHOST WILL HOLD YOUR HAND AND SAY, "LET'S GO. AVOID THAT THING BECAUSE IT WILL HURT YOU. COME THIS WAY." THE HOLY GHOST WHEN YOU ARE STUBBORN, YOU SAY, "OKAY, SINCE YOU INSIST, GO AHEAD AND DO IT. AND WHEN YOU COME BLEEDING, THE HOLY GHOST SAYS, you have learned your lesson. Let's keep going. IT'S THE HOLY GHOST. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HE IS A GUIDE, GUIDE YOU. THE HOLY GHOST IS GOING TO LEAD YOU. THE BIBLE SAYS ISRAEL WAS LED BY THE PILLAR OF FIRE. WHERE DID THE PILLAR OF FIRE? LEAD THEM TO THE RED SEA. THE RED SEA BEFORE THEM ON EITHER SIDE BEHIND THEM LED BY THE HOLY GHOST. YOU THINK THE PILLAR OF FIRE WAS surprised that there was the Red Sea? He was like, "Oh, HE DID IT ON PURPOSE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FOR THE EXPERIENCE. FOR THE EXPERIENCE. HE DID IT ON PURPOSE. THIS DAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RED SEA. IT WAS A PILLAR OF FIRE. LET GOD'S PEOPLE SEE. GOD WILL LEAD YOU IN DIFFICULT TIMES. GOD WILL ALLOW YOU TO ENTER INTO TEMPTATION BY THE HOLY GHOST. BUT WHAT IS HE DOING? HE IS BUILDING YOU UP EXPERIENCE BY EXPERIENCE FROM GLORY TO GLORY. HE IS ESTABLISHING YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. YOU ARE A DAUGHTER OF GOD. YOU CAME FROM GOD. YOU GO BACK TO GOD. THE SAME GOD WHO DELIVERED ME FROM A LION. THE SAME GOD WHO DELIVERED ME FROM A BEAR IS THE SAME GOD THAT WILL DELIVER ME FROM THIS COLL. GLORY. THANK YOU JESUS. BY THE HOLY GHOST GOD ALLOWED IT TO BLINDLY WALK INTO A TRAP. AND THERE WAS ARMIES, WELL ARMED ARMIES THAT HAD SET A TRAP FOR HIM. AND GOD ALLOWED HIM TO WALK INTO THAT TRAP BECAUSE HE HAD A PURPOSE TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE STRENGTH OF SAMSON. IT WAS IN HIS SPIRIT AND HE HAD NO WEAPONS AND DID NOT ALLOW SAMSON TO CARRY A WEAPON. DAY AND HE LOOKED AROUND AND HE FOUND A JOB OF A DONKEY AND BY THE DONKEY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE FOUGHT AN ARMY AND DESTROYED THEM BY THE HOLY GHOST, GOD WAS BUILDING A CHARACTER UNTIL HE GOT ONE DAY TO A PLACE WHERE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS BACKSLIDING, HE KNEW HIS GOD. SAY THE LORD ONCE MORE. YOU'VE DONE THIS WITH ME BEFORE. YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE. YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN. MY HAIR HAS GROWN BACK. YOU ARE STILL THE SAME GOD ONCE MORE. LET ME DIE WITHIN. THE SAME GOD THAT HAD BEEN WITH HIM STOOD WITH HIM AND HE DESTROYED PHILIST all the other young people allow God to guide you. ALLOW GOD TO HOLD YOUR HAND. ALLOW GOD TO SEND YOU TO THE RURAL AREAS TO TESTIFY THE GOSPEL. DON'T BE IN A RUSH TO HAVE A CHURCH IN CAMPA. DON'T BE IN A RUSH TO HAVE A church in Nairobi. DON'T BE IN A RUSH TO DRIVE A NICE car and have a house like THE PASTOR DRESS LIKE that other YOUNG SISTER. Don't have all these SILLY MINDS WHERE YOU are looking FOR A RICH BROTHER BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO BELIEVE THAT GOD CAN SEND A BROTHER WITH NOTHING AND YOU BEING A FAITH WOMAN. YOU WILL PRAY FOR GOD BLESS YOUR HUSBAND AND PROSPER HIM brother at church. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH BROTHER, God wants to mold character. God wants you to KNOW WHO YOU ARE. THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL KNOW WHAT GOD HAS PUT IN YOU IS WHEN HE PUTS YOU THROUGH EXPERIENCE THAT WILL REVEAL WHAT IS ON THE INSIDE. COMING TO THAT PLACE OF PERFECT REALIZATION. NOW AS I close the TITLE OF MY SERMON was and is tutored to perfect realization. by to perfect realization. Praise the Lord. John chapter 16, I have yet many things to say unto you, but he cannot bear you. How be it, when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you. into all truth. For he shall NOT SPEAK OF HIMSELF, BUT WHATSOEVER HE SHALL HEAR, THAT SHALL he speak, and he WILL SHOW YOU THINGS TO COME. He has given us a guide. Let the guide come in your life. Lose your car minds and accept the mind of Christ. by the Holy Ghost. Let him reveal to you WHO HE IS. Because as he reveals to you WHO HE IS, HE REVEALS to you who you are. SOMETIMES TAKES TIME, HE'S GOING TO PUT YOU IN SITUATION FOR YOU to dig deeper and realize what you've got. He's going to TEST YOUR PATIENCE. THE BIBLE SAYS HE MAY TURN the whole church against you, but it is God working ON YOUR CHARACTER. OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. We are the GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS. WE DO THINGS WITH REVELATION. WE ARE NOT TOO EXCITED, TOO IMPATIENT, BUT WE ARE PATIENT WITH GOD. REVELATION SONS AND DAUGHTERS. WE CANNOT LOSE. NEITHER CAN WE BE LOST BECAUSE GOD IS AND WE ARE NOT PROUD BEFORE OUR GOD. OUR GOD SHALL FIGHT FOR US. MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T MEET THIS SIDE, we'll meet ON THE OTHER SIDE. GOD BLESS YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you seen this word. Let your word be born in the m of my heart. If the song leader can sing that song. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; One of my longest sermons in recent history. Amen. But God is good. Let your word be born of my life. and let it live in me. Let it shine. Start inside this house of clay. Mold me every day. Oh, let word be in the m Let your word word in the manger of my heart and let it live in me. Let it shine. Start inside this house of clay and mold me every day. And let your words be warm in the manger of my Oh, may the brother come and help us sing this song. He made a way. You made a way. The one that we sing Amen. So that we can just worship together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then when he does, God bless you. made our way. You made our way. When I bounce against the wall and it looked as if it was all gone, you made our way and we standing here only because you Away. You made a way. You You made You You made a way. You &gt;&gt; when I pass the wall and you learn to see it was You made our way here. Behold you. Listen, we're going to sing this a few more times, but I want you to close your eyes and Think about everything that has been quite some serious things were said. And I kind of felt in my heart that indeed that must be God, collecting a bunch of young people and telling us serious serious things concerning our life. He has indeed made a way to move mountain to cause walls to fall over. But we can give him a moment and let him do it right. Would you just surrender your heart now? We are in his presence. I always want to feel that there's no rush. When you are in his presence, it's no longer time is no longer an issue. Just meditate as you sing about all the things that you let us sing. Brother Shalom. You made our way. Hallelujah. You made our way with a box against the wall and it looked as if it was over. You made our way. Hallelujah. And we're standing here only because you move mountains now to fall with your power for Miracles. There is nothing nothing. You move mountain. You go with your power. You are performing miracles right now in my life. Oh yes. That's why you sent your word to me. There was nothing nothing you tell him the way you away. Hallelujah. You made my way only because you made the way. Maybe you want him to move some mountains for you. But we have heard today when the man of God was preaching, this is a generation that wants things fast, a microwave generation, but you know, you see that you moved mountains because you sing it by faith. You already see him moving mountains. things are going to happen according to his will, according to his word. But the fact that you have heard what you have heard today, he's already moving those mountain. What is hard? What is hard? What is your mountain today? What is your mountain today? He is here to move that &gt;&gt; with his power. He is a miracle worker. He makes a way where there is no way and he's here to make a way right now. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we can just give it a few more moments in prayer and worship. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Mountains you cause. &gt;&gt; Sing it to him if you can now. your power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Miracle miracle. &gt;&gt; There is nothing there is nothing &gt;&gt; nothing possible with you. mercy and we stand before you away. You made a way. You made a way. You made a way. You away. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now we stand before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everybody in prayer now we have heard today the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a start and when he comes into YOUR HEART HE never leaves. But you see, you still have to come to MATURITY and you will go through things. You'll go through struggle. But you want to know WHO YOU ARE BEFORE YOU face life's challenge. You need to know what you have received. You need to know that is in your heart. You need to come to that realization. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; While everybody's praying, &gt;&gt; if I can have more sound, a little more sound. While everybody's praying, if you are here and your back is against the wall, your back is against the wall and you don't know what you've got, BUT YOU NEED SOMETHING TO BE ABLE TO go through the challenge. Your place IS AT THE ALTAR. LET ME TELL YOU, WE serve a real living God. A real living God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your back is against the wall. This is your moment.

No matter what I go through, THICK AND THIN, I know who I am. I want to know me. I WANT TO KNOW YOU THE POWER OF YOUR RESURRECTION. LISTEN, CHURCH. GOD STILL FILLS WITH THE HOLY GHOST.

We thank you for your for your blessings and we thank you for the anointing. We thank you for the ve that you've used. We believe word that we've not heard from man. We believe that we heard from you. You've come down again this year and again given us a good feast and father Lord you fed us and now we are giving you thanks for our spirits are satisfying and still hungering for heavenly father we say that may your presence that is here right now be with us let it not depart let it always bless our hearts heart. Let it go with us. Even when the conversion is over, let us not forget this. May this be a memorial shall move with us with every day everywhere that we shall go. Let us go with his presence and let it always do a change. shall continue growing continually in thine grace, in thine mercy and in power, in knowledge and in revelation. Let it be Lord that it shall be with us among our teenage and in our friends, in our peers that it shall bring a change from who we were before we came and that that we shall be after him. Grant it, Lord. as we praise thy name &gt;&gt; and in your name Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Have your seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us give the Lord a clap of praise for the word we have. There's a lot of things that has been said this morning. But you see, I just want to rehearse one or two things and then we dismiss so that we can go to lunch. When you know who you are, you remain humble. You stop pretending. You You just You are who you are. You know who you are. You don't need to pretend about it. See what it is. What is it? It's confidence without ego. Jesus knew who he was. He never allowed the the the Pharisees to talk HIM OUT OF IT. NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAID, HE SAID, "If you don't believe that I am he, you will die in your sin." Yet the Bible says, "Let this man that was in Christ, he was in THE FORM OF GOD, BUT HE NEVER MADE HIMSELF EQUAL WITH GOD." SO HE being God, yet he humbled himself into a form of a son. So when you realize when you come to the PERFECT REALIZATION of your identity in CHRIST then you realize you are the righteousness. You the righteousness of God. How does it sound? It sounds unbelievable. But that's the realization you have to come to. When you come to that, not even the devil can defeat you. Do you know brother Bham said that if the the true church will know who she is &gt;&gt; and what she stand your purpose the devil he she the church will be an invisible church even if all hell we sing a song ALL HELL ARE THEY CANNOT DEFEAT me to an extent. You go THROUGH STUFF, you are not going to doubt your experience. For those of you who have the experience of the baptism of you, you are not going to doubt it because you see we have heard that that's a part of the package. The troubles and the trials AND THE TEST QUESTION YOUR EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE WHEN HE COMES IN, HE NEVER LEAVES. HE COMES TO STAY. HE ABIDES. But the troubles KEEP COMING. KEEP COMING. WHY DO THEY COME? BECAUSE HE IS IN THERE. HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL STEPPED INTO THE PROMISED LAND, TROUBLE STARTED. THEY ACTUALLY STARTED WITH JERO. WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAD TO CLAIM EVERY INCH of ground. IT WAS PROMISED TO THEM. SO WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE BAPT Holy Ghost, THEN THE BATTLE STARTS. THEN YOU ARE RECRUITED AS A SOLDIER IN THE ARMY OF THE LORD. AND THIS BAND OF SOLDIERS ARE INVISIBLE. THEY CANNOT BE DEFEATED. I AM ONE OF YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THINGS COME MY WAY, I am not going to say wait. Am I really baptized with the Holy Ghost? People think when the Holy Ghost comes, he will come and take away the demons. He will not. He will guide you. He will lead you. That's the purpose. And I'm so thankful that we have received a messenger in our day that has brought these these things to us and men of God that can come and break the word to the extent that everyone can understand.
