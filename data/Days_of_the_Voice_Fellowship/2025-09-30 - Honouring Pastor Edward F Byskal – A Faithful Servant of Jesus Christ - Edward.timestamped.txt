[0:01] while you have strength. Don't wait till
[0:02] you're laying someplace and and and
[0:05] breathing and gasping saying, "Well, if
[0:06] I only had my strength back, I'd go and
[0:08] do something for God." Do it now.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Do it while you have your strength.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that word is energized.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; How many believe that this word is
[0:18] energized?
[0:20] And it's energized with a divine
[0:23] guidance system
[0:25] &gt;&gt; to take you to the ultimate destination.
[0:30] He said the word is again today being
[0:34] waved over the people. The word the
[0:36] locos because out from him has come a
[0:40] rise. We're going to conclude this age.
[0:44] I believe he has confidence. I have a
[0:46] people on earth that believe the word.
[0:49] They've consumed the veil. They know who
[0:52] I am and they know that I am in them and
[0:55] they are in me. And they are preparing
[0:59] now for the rapture because Satan has so
[1:02] contaminated our thinking that somehow
[1:04] we've got an allowance for a mistake
[1:06] that I'm going to announce to you
[1:08] tonight. This bride will not miss on one
[1:11] word. You Lors, Methodists, Baptist,
[1:14] Pentecostals, and nothing and world and
[1:18] sinners come out
[1:20] and be identified
[1:23] with your true lineage. It's not that
[1:25] you have to hear something new. Let God
[1:28] inspire the message you already know.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; You don't need something new. You need
[1:33] the fire
[1:35] &gt;&gt; to quicken what you already have. They
[1:37] ate there and they died. You're eating
[1:40] now to live.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; I have confidence that we're going to
[1:44] sit around the married supper table and
[1:47] we're going to look into one another's
[1:48] faces and a lamb will come and dry our
[1:51] tears away. something one day that
[1:55] called and said, "I want you to preach
[1:57] the gospel." It's him,
[2:00] Christ. And if it's not Christ, you
[2:02] folks are wasting your time. You ought
[2:04] to go and find yourself a pastor. That's
[2:07] what you need. You need somebody who
[2:09] speaks on behalf of Christ.
[2:11] So that there's something inside that
[2:13] says, "That's the truth. I'll hang on to
[2:16] that and stake my life on it." That's
[2:20] what you need.
[2:23] [Music]
[2:31] Hallelujah.
[2:33] We can praise him this. We can thank
[2:36] him. Can you say praise the Lord?
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48] That atmosphere.
[2:50] Amen. And it's a wonderful thing, isn't
[2:51] it?
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I personally want to thank God
[2:57] for the life of my grandfather. And I
[3:00] want to do it this morning just for a
[3:02] few minutes through my worship and
[3:05] praise. Is that okay? And I want you to
[3:07] join me this morning and let it just
[3:09] well up inside of you that thanksgiving
[3:13] for a man that's sacrificed
[3:16] for this gospel. Amen. And so join with
[3:18] me. I want to sing a glorious church.
[3:21] I'm looking at a glorious church this
[3:23] morning. Amen. One that didn't come
[3:26] easy. Amen. He came with sacrifice. So
[3:28] let's just praise him. Let me hear your
[3:30] voices.
[3:32] Amen.
[3:36] For to you coming
[3:42] from the tears of life. Sing it now. Oh,

[13:51] Lord.

[13:54] worship, didn't he? He knew that it was
[13:58] going forth to prepare hearts so that
[14:00] when the word would come forth, it would
[14:03] be good ground for a seed to be planted.
[14:06] How many's experienced that before in

[20:37] happen. So, we just collected a group of
[20:40] willing voices. And we don't intend this
[20:41] to be a special. We want you to sing
[20:43] along with us. And to all you on the
[20:46] choir risers, how many times did we hear
[20:47] brother Ed said, "Sing it with all your

[20:51] we're going to rejoice this morning.
[20:52] We're going to sing a few songs. We have

[29:26] You always
[29:28] [Music]
[29:35] [Music]
[29:42] Well, I hope if I ever have a memorial
[29:44] service, it sounds exactly like this.
[29:48] Uh, good morning. Uh, I'd like to thank
[29:51] everyone here in attendance. for coming
[29:53] to honor the life of my grandfather and
[29:55] my pastor,
[29:57] a man who has made it a challenge to
[29:59] find words to describe.
[30:02] I'm Edward Biscll's oldest grandson,
[30:05] Matthew Ardiel. Most of you know me. Um,
[30:10] we grandkids
[30:12] uh had a bit of a special insight to
[30:14] grandpa that um some didn't get to see.
[30:18] Uh maybe the playful side to him and his
[30:20] great sense of humor. I know a lot of
[30:22] you saw that too. Um,
[30:25] each of us grandkids
[30:28] at some point early in our lives, uh,
[30:31] some of the first instruction we
[30:32] received was on the, uh, principle of
[30:35] compound interest.
[30:37] Um, I think most of most of my cousins
[30:40] would agree with that. Uh, usually
[30:42] written on a restaurant napkin. uh
[30:45] whether we wanted to hear it or not.
[30:48] Some of us got it and some of us are
[30:50] still working on it.
[30:53] Um I'm just gonna I'll read a little bit
[30:56] more, but I was thinking about some of
[30:58] my times with grandpa and uh
[31:01] um you know the uh there was little
[31:06] things that would kind of describe the
[31:08] way he was. you know, we I had the
[31:10] opportunity after I just gotten my
[31:11] driver's license to uh drive home from
[31:14] Colona with him and uh some I I don't
[31:17] even know why. I think grandma must have
[31:19] come back with the girls or mom or
[31:21] something. So, it was just grandpa and I
[31:23] on with a nice 4-hour drive coming home
[31:25] from Colona. I was maybe 16 and just
[31:27] gotten my license and we got to Merit
[31:30] and he said, "Uh, do you want to drive
[31:33] the rest of the way?"
[31:35] And grandpa had a pretty quick car that
[31:38] could move. So I thought, "Sure,
[31:40] Grandpa. I'll drive." So we drove and
[31:44] you know, why not? I kept the speed
[31:45] limit. And we got past Hope. And many of
[31:48] you will know kind of that area between
[31:49] Hope and Chilowak. There's thick trees
[31:51] between both sides of the highway. And
[31:54] uh as I was coming through there, I
[31:56] looked over at grandpa and he just kind
[31:57] of dozed off a little bit. So I thought,
[32:00] "Well, I think I'll see what this thing
[32:02] can do."
[32:04] So, I gave it some gas and I'm flying
[32:07] through there. Grandpa's just kind of
[32:09] dozing to my right and sure enough,
[32:11] through those thick trees, police
[32:12] officer steps out,
[32:16] pulled me over.
[32:18] So, I uh I couldn't believe it, you
[32:20] know, 16 years old. I got my first
[32:23] speeding ticket.
[32:25] So, we pull over and grandpa kind of
[32:26] comes to himself, but I wasn't even
[32:28] looking at him.
[32:29] So, police officer comes to the window
[32:32] and says, "License, registration for the
[32:34] first time I'd pulled it out, you know,
[32:36] and I didn't even look at grandpa. I
[32:37] just grabbed the insurance." And he's
[32:39] just sitting there quietly.
[32:41] So, I hand my information, gives me a
[32:44] nice $150 ticket. Well, I'm pretty sure
[32:46] I didn't even have $150 in my bank
[32:48] account at the time, but anyway, hands
[32:51] me the ticket. And so, I just look at
[32:53] it. And that was the first time I kind
[32:55] of looked back over at grandpa like
[32:57] this. and he's just staring at me and he
[33:00] he looks at me and gives me a big grin
[33:04] and just slap me on the shoulder like
[33:06] that and grab the ticket out of my hand
[33:08] and he paid the bill.
[33:11] So that was that was what grandpa was
[33:13] like. And I'm sure we all have little
[33:15] stories like that, but uh sorry for
[33:17] saying something a little personal
[33:19] there.
[33:20] Um, I'm here for the most part to fill
[33:23] in some of the historical blanks of uh,
[33:26] grandpa's life, the history that shaped
[33:28] him.
[33:30] Um, grandpa gave the majority of his
[33:33] life to the gospel and spent his time
[33:35] and energy tirelessly for people around
[33:38] the world that drew on his wisdom,
[33:40] strength, and vision.
[33:42] Grant had endless care and compassion
[33:44] for any life in need, spiritually and
[33:47] naturally.
[33:49] I believe most present today are here to
[33:51] give respect and thanksgiving for what
[33:53] Ed Biscll contributed to their lives but
[33:56] would be unaware that he was born in the
[33:57] little town of Waka Saskatchewan on
[34:00] October 2nd 1934
[34:03] that he has an older sister Anne
[34:06] that watched out for him as they were at
[34:08] times separated due to the death of
[34:10] their mother when Eddie was only seven.
[34:13] After his father remarried the family
[34:15] was blessed with Sharon. Auntie Anne and
[34:17] Sharon are both present today and would
[34:20] likely have many stories and fond
[34:22] memories to share.
[34:24] I'm sure most know that Ruth Biscll that
[34:27] sits here today is Ed Biscll's wife of
[34:29] 71 years.
[34:32] But maybe not that at the age of 11, he
[34:34] met this Ruth Harper in Dawson Creek, BC
[34:37] at the age of 18 and 19
[34:41] respectively, they were married on May
[34:43] 26th, 1954.
[34:46] In the early 60s and now with three
[34:48] small girls in tow,
[34:50] Linda, Marilyn, and Joanne, they moved
[34:53] to Victoria, BC to aid in bringing the
[34:56] gospel to the native Indian villages
[34:58] along the west coast of Vancouver
[34:59] Island.
[35:01] With a love of music, Ed on the guitar,
[35:04] and Ruth on the accordion and piano, and
[35:05] a tiny trio of three girls, which you
[35:07] saw in the photos, they traveled to many
[35:09] of the reserves preaching and singing.
[35:13] They traveled. The love for song and
[35:15] harmonies has carried down through the
[35:17] generations and brings joy and refuge to
[35:19] us all as a family.
[35:22] Grandpa started working for Maynard's
[35:23] Auctioneers while in Victoria and soon
[35:25] moved up the ladder, being transferred
[35:27] to Toronto for several years and then
[35:29] taking presidency of Maynard's
[35:30] Auctioneers in Vancouver. Not very many
[35:33] years later, as grandpa's passionate
[35:36] time for the spreading of the gospel
[35:38] increased,
[35:39] he sold Maynards to his then friend,
[35:41] partner and friend, Bob Seabolt, who is
[35:44] present with us today. Thanks for being
[35:46] here, Bob.
[35:50] Grandpa and Grandma and the girls were
[35:51] living in a big white house on the main
[35:54] street of Cloverdale, just down 60th
[35:57] here
[35:59] at the time. And in the early 1970s,
[36:01] feeling a move of God amongst the youth,
[36:03] it became the Bible way house, a beacon
[36:06] of light for many of the young people in
[36:07] the local area. And I guess you could
[36:09] say the rest is history.
[36:12] I was thinking of the many visionary
[36:14] achievements of grandpa and it brought
[36:15] to mind a statement he made in recent
[36:17] months. even though his ability to
[36:19] express himself had become more
[36:20] difficult.
[36:22] A staff member her grandma grandpa Ben
[36:26] um was asking grandma what her life
[36:30] motto would be and my grandpa answered
[36:33] for her in a clear strong voice. He said
[36:36] there are no limits.
[36:40] That was definitely a motto for him as
[36:41] well grandma.
[36:43] And uh I brought this little Bible up
[36:46] here. It's Bible. First Bible I got from
[36:48] you was from 1984
[36:51] and you gave it you and grandpa gave it
[36:53] to me on my seventh birth or at
[36:55] Christmas when I was seven.
[36:58] But uh we love you too, Grandma. So
[37:02] we're happy to be able to speak today.
[37:04] Thank you.
[37:07] [Applause]
[37:18] Beautiful
[37:20] Christ.
[37:22] Beautiful
[37:24] Christ.
[37:27] King of my life is he.
[37:34] Oh beautiful
[37:37] Christ,
[37:39] beautiful
[37:41] Christ.
[37:43] My
[37:47] an angel if you'll make your way up. Oh,
[37:51] beautiful
[37:53] Christ.
[37:55] Beautiful
[37:57] Christ,
[37:59] king of my life,
[38:03] is your king this morning. Oh,
[38:07] beautiful
[38:09] Christ.
[38:11] Oh beautiful
[38:15] my
[38:19] shall.
[38:45] [Music]
[39:02] Paul was weery on his journey.
[39:06] his body frail and weak.
[39:10] The apostle knew the end was near as he
[39:15] dipped his pen in ink.
[39:18] And he wrote, "Timothy,
[39:20] my son,
[39:22] I have fought the fight of faith.
[39:27] carry on what I've begun. But most of
[39:32] all, I pray.
[39:36] Preach the word. Preach the cross.
[39:40] Preach redemption to a lost and dying
[39:45] world.
[39:48] Lift your voice unashamed
[39:52] of the gospel of his name.
[39:59] until all have heard
[40:04] preach the word.
[40:08] [Music]
[40:12] Paul and Timothy
[40:14] are gone, but the letter still remains.
[40:20] And the mission that was written down
[40:24] calls out to us today.
[40:28] Lift the name of Jesus
[40:31] higher until the whole world knows
[40:36] the story of amazing grace. We are
[40:41] messengers of hope.
[40:46] Preach the word. Preach the cross.
[40:50] Preach redemption to a lost and dying
[40:54] world.
[40:58] Lift your voice unashamed
[41:02] of the gospel of his name.
[41:07] [Applause]
[41:08] [Music]
[41:11] Preach the word. Preach the cross.
[41:15] Preach redemption to a lost and dying
[41:20] world.
[41:23] Lift your voice unashamed
[41:27] of the gospel of his name
[41:33] until all have
[41:38] preach the word. Preach the word. Reach
[41:42] the word.
[41:45] Preach the world. Preach the cross.
[41:49] Reach red to a lost and dying world.
[41:56] Always lift your voice unashamed
[42:01] of the gospel of his name
[42:07] until
[42:09] he ever
[42:12] preach the world. Heat.
[42:16] Heat.
[42:26] Heat. Heat.
[42:44] [Music]
[42:46] [Applause]
[42:53] Thanks, honey. He sure did.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful. Thankful for all
[42:59] of you that are here this morning. And I
[43:02] look around the room and see friends and
[43:04] old friends and friends that have
[43:05] traveled far and wide. And for that on
[43:09] part of Sister Ruth's behalf, my behalf,
[43:13] the family, church, thank you for being
[43:16] here and making this day a special day
[43:18] for us all.
[43:21] I can say um
[43:25] he was an amazing man
[43:28] and for us that have known him um um
[43:32] I've known him all my life it seems and
[43:35] he's
[43:38] a man I feel privileged to be able to
[43:40] stand behind stand beside and say he was
[43:43] not only my pastor father-in-law friend
[43:48] he was a mentor guiding tonight
[43:52] and a wonderful pastor to this this
[43:54] church and local assembly.
[43:59] Brother Ed had a consuming desire to
[44:02] spread the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[44:07] It wasn't just a desire. It was a
[44:09] burning fervent desire. And he was a man
[44:12] of God that loved the Lord Jesus, loved
[44:14] this message
[44:16] and put it into action. A lot of people
[44:19] can use a lot of words and say a lot of
[44:22] things and do nothing.
[44:24] Brother Biscll was a man of action
[44:28] that spread this gospel.
[44:35] Dad took a change of code or what we
[44:37] call a body change on September the 17th
[44:41] at 534
[44:44] surrounded by his darling wife and
[44:47] children
[44:49] grandchildren
[44:52] and we are able to see this glorious
[44:54] passing of a man of God into the
[44:57] presence of the Lord. one of the most,
[44:59] as they say, the peaceful passing we
[45:02] have witnessed.
[45:04] So to show your love and be here this
[45:06] morning
[45:08] means a lot not only to mom, I'm sure,
[45:12] not only to the girls, Linda, Maryland,
[45:14] and Joanne, but means a lot to me and to
[45:18] this church. And we thank God for you
[45:20] and thank you for making the effort to
[45:22] be here, brother. a long way to bring
[45:26] Israel for the first time. Thank you so
[45:29] so so very much. He was an incredible
[45:32] man and yes, words could not really
[45:35] describe. I think you saw some slides
[45:38] before we came out and and if they have
[45:42] could be told, we'd be here a long time.
[45:46] Incredible father, incredible husband,
[45:49] incredible grandfather.
[45:52] Brother Biscll wished that that this
[45:55] service or would be much like a service
[45:58] church service that we enjoyed and
[46:01] behind the pulpit ministering the word
[46:02] of the Lord and it was great. Bob, you
[46:06] missed a lot. You would have loved to
[46:07] seen him in action. I think you saw a
[46:10] little bit and he was a tremendous
[46:12] friend to you. He loved you.
[46:20] Today we're going to hear from Pastor
[46:22] Ron Spencer from Full Gospel Lighthouse
[46:25] Tabernacle from from Virginia, Pastor
[46:29] Tim Puit, Evening Light Tabernacle from
[46:32] Louisiana.
[46:34] These are caliber of men that brother
[46:37] Biscll
[46:38] and we've loved them and they've been a
[46:40] great part of our church here for many,
[46:44] many years. I have the deep honor to
[46:48] have you here. sitting on this platform
[46:51] with us.
[46:53] I want to thank every minister
[46:56] who brought their themselves and their
[46:58] wives of course and have traveled and
[47:02] sacrificed to be here. He was indeed a
[47:06] man that touched many lives.
[47:10] He was extraordinary.
[47:14] He only had a heart. a heart for his
[47:17] family and a heart for the family of
[47:19] God.
[47:22] What set him apart was this in
[47:24] unquenchable desire
[47:27] to reach the unreachable, to find the
[47:31] predestinated,
[47:33] to cross borders and to bring the light
[47:35] of the gospel to every corner of the
[47:38] earth. I have never known a man that has
[47:41] traveled for over 160 times overseas
[47:46] and many times traveling for not just a
[47:48] week or a weekend or for two weeks. In
[47:52] the beginnings they were three to four
[47:54] to five weeks at a time and he would
[47:57] call me and say I'll take the service on
[47:59] Sunday. I thought that was amazing
[48:03] until I got older. I'm not that old but
[48:07] older. I realize the taxing and how hard
[48:11] that is. And he was amazing.
[48:16] We thank you for taking this time to to
[48:18] join us and to be a part of this morning
[48:21] service as we thank God for a life
[48:25] definitely well-lived. And and um would
[48:29] it be all right, Mom, to explain this a
[48:31] little bit so that people don't think
[48:33] we're radical or something?
[48:37] Dad was a man of the wilderness
[48:39] and he had the privilege to hunt with a
[48:42] prophet. Hunt with a prophet of this
[48:46] age. And if you notice the picture here
[48:48] there on the corner there is a called a
[48:50] green checkered shirt.
[48:53] Brother Bram had a vision and told
[48:56] brother Biscll that there will be some
[48:58] young men and one of them will be
[49:00] wearing a green checkered shirt.
[49:03] And many of you maybe have seen it or
[49:05] not seen it, but brother Brandham
[49:07] mentioned it many times. And so it was
[49:11] thought that that would be the picture.
[49:13] Brother Ed let me use that gun one time.
[49:16] And I know why he let me use it. Cuz it
[49:18] broke my shoulder.
[49:20] It kicked like a mule. It was crazy. I
[49:24] said, "What a hunter." Dad was quite the
[49:26] hunter and the marksman.
[49:28] But that is why he he's not only a
[49:30] preacher. He was not only a
[49:33] a husband, a father.
[49:37] He was a man of God and he was a man of
[49:39] the wilderness.
[49:42] And as these brothers will come and
[49:43] minister the word of God, may the Holy
[49:46] Spirit punctuate the word speak to your
[49:49] hearts deeply. And again, I thank you
[49:51] all for taking your time to celebrate
[49:54] this great life of brother Ed Biscll.
[49:56] I'd ask brother Ron Spencer if you would
[49:59] come please at this time.
[50:20] God bless you.
[50:23] I would like to thank you for being
[50:25] here.
[50:26] I would like to thank Sister Ruth and
[50:28] the family
[50:30] for inviting me to be a part of this and
[50:33] I would call it the highest honor of my
[50:35] life.
[50:42] Brother Ed was a quite a mentor to me, a
[50:46] father figure to me,
[50:49] and I was honored to have so many
[50:51] opportunities to be with him. And and we
[50:54] had so many supernatural moments
[50:55] together.
[50:59] We loved him with all of our hearts
[51:02] for the about the last 20 years. I'm so
[51:05] glad to have my wife and my son and
[51:07] daughter-in-law with us. And for about
[51:09] the last 20 years, every day
[51:13] I committed to listen to brother Biscll
[51:16] a service every day
[51:20] because I loved him. So it wasn't man
[51:23] worship
[51:24] and neither was it trying to catch the
[51:26] personality of a man, but I loved the
[51:29] Christ that was in him.
[51:32] He loved the prophet and he loved this
[51:34] message with all of his heart.
[51:37] And I think all of us are sitting here
[51:39] that have been touched. I think we could
[51:42] all say that we have a brother Biscll
[51:44] story.
[51:46] And we're just thankful that his life
[51:49] touched our life and it made our life
[51:53] better.
[51:54] It made our life better.
[52:00] In in 2007,
[52:04] I was burned in a horrible explosion
[52:07] and I was taken taken to the hospital
[52:11] and then to another hospital where I
[52:13] would be in a burn unit.
[52:16] And it was on the about the fourth day
[52:20] my son was burned as well.
[52:23] and and uh my wife was between hospitals
[52:27] and brother Biscll called Sister Connie
[52:31] and said uh he talked to her and he said
[52:33] I believe the hearing is the last to go
[52:38] and he told Sister Connie that I was up
[52:40] early this morning which it would have
[52:42] been very early. I was up early this
[52:44] morning and the Lord spoke to me that we
[52:47] have bought Mount Baker Bible Way Camp
[52:51] and that you have loved and enjoyed. And
[52:54] he said, "The Lord spoke to me that
[52:57] Brother Ron will be the speaker next
[52:59] year at that camp."
[53:02] It was that day that they gave me up
[53:05] because my lungs were burned so bad.
[53:09] And Sister Connie would go for the next
[53:11] month to the hospital with doctors
[53:15] telling her that I wouldn't live. But
[53:18] the man that we're memorializing today
[53:20] had called her led of the Lord and told
[53:23] her that I would not just be at the
[53:25] camp, but I would be the speaker at the
[53:28] camp.
[53:32] We're honored to be here. I can't say
[53:35] enough words.
[53:37] I know you are honored.
[53:40] He lived three lifetimes in one.
[53:43] He had a phenomenal family that is
[53:45] sitting here today.
[53:47] And he told me many times of how much he
[53:49] loved each and every one of you. And I
[53:52] love each and every one of you. And
[53:54] we've had a lot of wonderful moments in
[53:56] our lives together with the meetings
[53:59] that we've gathered. Brother Tom and I
[54:02] and brother Michael and brother Murphy.
[54:04] Brother Murphy is brother Biscll's son
[54:10] and he told me that many times. He's my
[54:14] son. He had three wonderful, beautiful
[54:17] daughters and he had a son.
[54:20] And we're so thankful for Brother
[54:21] Murphy.
[54:24] We're thankful for brother Tom
[54:27] &gt;&gt; and his leadership
[54:29] since a boy and doing all the the work
[54:33] on our way here.
[54:35] We were we were just talking about the
[54:37] radio broadcast and listening to it and
[54:40] brother Tom was instrumental in putting
[54:42] all that together and we would listen to
[54:45] it on Saturday night and it would be
[54:47] clips of the prophet of God and then we
[54:50] would hear that and we had a we had a
[54:53] green box radio that we would set in our
[54:57] in our kitchen and we would all set four
[55:00] chairs and we would sit and listen to
[55:02] that and rejoice and shout and we just
[55:05] love the message all of our lives.
[55:07] That's what's brought us together.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; And uh
[55:13] and I'll just say it plainly. I think
[55:16] Brother Biscll is one of the greatest
[55:17] speakers that ever lived in life.
[55:21] And by saying that, I want to tell you,
[55:23] I hope that you appreciated your time
[55:26] with him
[55:27] &gt;&gt; and you gather it and look back on it as
[55:30] he would stand and speak masterpiece
[55:32] after masterpiece after masterpiece. And
[55:36] and I trust in the coming days, you'll
[55:37] go back and listen to some of those
[55:39] masterpieces.
[55:41] Of course, listen to the prophet of God,
[55:43] but listen to those masterpieces. and
[55:45] and uh no matter what it would be, I
[55:48] just trust that you would be blessed by
[55:50] that.
[55:54] I was told that this is not a memorial
[55:56] service, but it's really hard not to be.
[56:00] But I spoke a message in front of
[56:02] brother Biscll and to the family you
[56:04] will understand and no kind of holding
[56:06] things close to your heart. I was
[56:09] praying for days of what I would speak
[56:11] here because there's not enough time or
[56:13] not enough words that can be said. I'd
[56:16] like to speak to you on what will you be
[56:19] remembered for.
[56:24] I think this would be the theme of
[56:26] brother Biscll's life in first John
[56:29] chapter 1 and verse one. That which was
[56:32] from the beginning,
[56:35] which we have heard,
[56:37] which we have seen with our eyes,
[56:40] &gt;&gt; which we have looked upon and our hands
[56:42] have handled of the word of life.
[56:46] For the life was manifested, and we have
[56:48] seen it, and bear witness, and show unto
[56:52] you that which is eternal life, which
[56:55] was the with the Father, and was
[56:57] manifested unto us,
[57:00] that which we have seen, and heard,
[57:04] declare we unto you, that ye also may
[57:07] have fellowship with us. And truly our
[57:10] fellowship is with the Father, and with
[57:13] his son, Jesus Christ. and these things
[57:16] that we write unto you that your joy may
[57:20] be full.
[57:24] Malachi 4 and verse 5.
[57:28] Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[57:32] before the coming of the great and
[57:33] dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall
[57:36] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[57:39] children, and the heart of their
[57:41] children to their fathers, lest I come
[57:44] and smite the earth with a curse.
[57:48] I believe we could use this as a text
[57:50] this morning in 2 Timothy 4 and verse
[57:53] one. I charge thee before God and the
[57:58] Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
[58:01] quick and the dead at his appearing and
[58:04] his kingdom.
[58:05] Preach the word. Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Be instant in season and out of season.
[58:13] Reprove and rebuke and exhort with all
[58:16] longsuffering and and doctrine. For the
[58:18] time will come when they shall will not
[58:20] endure sound doctrine. But after their
[58:24] own lust shall they heap to themselves
[58:26] teachers having itching ears, and they
[58:30] shall turn away their ears from the
[58:32] truth, and they shall be turned unto
[58:34] fables. But watch thou in all things
[58:38] endure afflictions. Do the work of an
[58:41] evangelist. Make full proof of thy
[58:43] ministry. For I am now ready to be
[58:46] offered, and the time of my departure
[58:49] departure is at hand. I believe we could
[58:52] say this. I have fought a good fight.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; I have finished my course. I have kept
[58:59] the faith. I have kept the faith. I have
[59:04] kept the faith.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; If anybody has kept the faith, he kept
[59:09] the faith.
[59:11] Henceforth there is laid up for me a
[59:14] crown of righteousness,
[59:16] which the Lord, the righteous judge,
[59:19] shall give me at that day. And not to me
[59:22] only, but unto all of them which also
[59:25] love his appearing. And we can all say
[59:29] amen.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13.
[59:37] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[59:39] apprehended,
[59:41] but this one thing that I do, forgetting
[59:44] those things which are behind, and
[59:47] reaching forth unto those things which
[59:49] are before,
[59:51] I press towards the mark for the prize
[59:55] of the high calling of God in Christ
[59:58] Jesus. Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; And we could say decade after decade
[1:00:04] after decade,
[1:00:06] we watched Brother Ed Bisll do that.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; He never flinched.
[1:00:16] He never backed off.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; He stood faithful.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; He stood as a representative of this
[1:00:27] this message.
[1:00:30] I believe God sent an ambassador to the
[1:00:32] whole world.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; His life touched millions.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; We are taught
[1:00:45] that nothing can rem remove our name
[1:00:50] from the lamb's book of life.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; That God designed it all. God purposed
[1:00:57] our life. God pre-planned our life. God
[1:01:01] built us in a certain way.
[1:01:04] When God wrote his first Bible in the
[1:01:06] heavens, we were represented there.
[1:01:10] God prepared for our coming.
[1:01:14] He has prepared for our leaving here.
[1:01:19] God orchestrated it all. Our names are
[1:01:24] found in the lamb's book.
[1:01:27] And that ought to make every one of us
[1:01:29] shout.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Phenomenal speakers said here today, men
[1:01:35] that have taken this message that have
[1:01:37] been inspired
[1:01:40] by brother Ed.
[1:01:42] men around the world that couldn't be
[1:01:44] here that have been inspired to pick up
[1:01:48] this message and run with everything
[1:01:51] that is within them.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Every service, brother Biscll would talk
[1:01:56] of this message and his vision for it.
[1:02:00] And he believed fundamentally
[1:02:04] that if he had the message and he had
[1:02:07] the book, every believer
[1:02:10] should have the opportunity to have this
[1:02:13] message
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; that they can read it.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll was not only a great
[1:02:19] father, he was a great visionary.
[1:02:27] not just for you young people to have a
[1:02:29] school,
[1:02:32] but when we were around many years ago,
[1:02:34] he began to talk about a a kiosk.
[1:02:38] And he had a vision in his mind that
[1:02:41] this can be placed in places to where
[1:02:43] that a person can walk up and push a
[1:02:45] button
[1:02:47] and they could get the book.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we now have the message hub
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; that thousands have worked on it.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Anywhere in the world you can have this
[1:02:59] message at your display. I believe that
[1:03:02] we can say well done brother Biscoll
[1:03:09] in John chapter 14 and verse one. Let
[1:03:12] not your heart be troubled.
[1:03:16] You believe in God, believe also in me.
[1:03:19] In my father's house are
[1:03:22] many mansions. And if it were not so, I
[1:03:26] would have told you. I go to prepare a
[1:03:31] place for you.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[1:03:37] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:03:39] myself, that where I am,
[1:03:43] there you may be also. Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I don't believe Jesus was just talking
[1:03:50] to those disciples that were standing
[1:03:52] there,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; but I believe he was talking to us.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; I had the wonderful opportunity as as
[1:03:59] I've been studying over this the last
[1:04:00] few days. And Sister Joanne, I thought
[1:04:03] about it. There was three particular
[1:04:06] messages that I sat with him and and he
[1:04:09] preached these sermons.
[1:04:11] A body thou hast prepared for me,
[1:04:16] a masterpiece of masterpieces.
[1:04:21] And he spoke, "A place by me."
[1:04:27] And he would take that theme from
[1:04:29] sitting on a log.
[1:04:32] Brother Tim, at your place, he would
[1:04:35] speak about he came to me there and you
[1:04:38] played while he preached. Sister Linda,
[1:04:43] this message wasn't just words to him.
[1:04:46] It was life.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; And he would speak another one that
[1:04:50] we're all looking forward to now.
[1:04:53] Anointed for rapture.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; I believe there's a people that is
[1:04:58] sitting here that are stepping into that
[1:05:02] role.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; It's not just a great sermon or a great
[1:05:05] masterpiece, but we're anointed for
[1:05:07] rapture.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. For you that have sitting here
[1:05:11] that were in business,
[1:05:13] I believe I could say this. Brother Ed
[1:05:16] could have been the prime minister.
[1:05:19] He carried himself with such dignity
[1:05:23] to be a a man from the country, a uh
[1:05:28] just a country boy, almost an orphan
[1:05:30] child.
[1:05:32] But yet he carried himself and held his
[1:05:34] shoulders back. and everyone in the
[1:05:37] world could identify with him.
[1:05:41] And now being a visionary,
[1:05:44] he was a phenomenal businessman.
[1:05:47] Brother Matt, he gave me those same
[1:05:50] sermons about compound interest.
[1:05:56] I was in Switzerland
[1:05:59] and we were getting on a on a elevator.
[1:06:02] You'll like this. We were getting on the
[1:06:05] elevator and he said, "Brother Ryan, I
[1:06:06] want to talk to you and I want to have a
[1:06:08] meeting with you at breakfast in the
[1:06:09] morning." Brother David, it was hundreds
[1:06:12] of people having breakfast in the same
[1:06:14] hall.
[1:06:16] And he said, "I I want just you and I to
[1:06:18] sit at the table." And I was thinking,
[1:06:20] "Absolutely impossible.
[1:06:23] Everybody going backwards and forwards."
[1:06:25] And he just simply when we sat down, he
[1:06:27] said, "Look at me. Don't look at nobody
[1:06:29] else.
[1:06:31] I want you to hear every word I've got
[1:06:33] to say. It is important.
[1:06:35] You
[1:06:37] It's important what I'm going to tell
[1:06:39] you. And people would come and want to
[1:06:41] speak and it was just like he was zoned
[1:06:43] in and we had a glass hub around us.
[1:06:48] I will I will never forget he sat with
[1:06:51] me and he just sat down and just talked
[1:06:55] to me about preaching the
[1:06:58] responsibility,
[1:07:00] not being redundant, coming to the
[1:07:02] pullpit and being focused and being
[1:07:06] right on
[1:07:08] holding this message 100% fant with
[1:07:11] everything that is within me. And if
[1:07:14] you're not inspired in study, don't take
[1:07:16] it to the pullpit.
[1:07:21] And he repeated some of that, too.
[1:07:27] What a reunion that must be going on
[1:07:29] there.
[1:07:33] He's in a body that he can shout,
[1:07:36] worship.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; But I can just imagine as the voice went
[1:07:40] out, a new arrival.
[1:07:45] Ed Biscll
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; has arrived.
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; I am sure thousands of people
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; wanted to have a second to shake his
[1:08:07] hand.
[1:08:10] his mother, his father,
[1:08:14] his loved ones,
[1:08:16] preachers,
[1:08:18] my father, my father-in-law,
[1:08:20] brother Henry Green,
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Dan Daisley,
[1:08:25] men around the world, Billy Andrews,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; people that you know and love, people
[1:08:31] that went on from this body of
[1:08:33] believers.
[1:08:34] And he wasn't an old man with gray hair
[1:08:36] today.
[1:08:38] his eyes sparkling and a step in his
[1:08:41] feet.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It was everything that he preached
[1:08:46] about,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; every vision.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; When he preached about the log and
[1:08:52] sitting there with the prophet of God,
[1:08:55] he transported every one of us
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; to sit in the log. when he talked about
[1:09:01] heaven, he transported every one of us
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; to give us a vision of what he's going
[1:09:09] through. Sister Ruth today,
[1:09:13] we've had a few moments with Sister
[1:09:15] Ruth.
[1:09:17] And she says she hasn't shed a tear.
[1:09:21] Maybe in the future she will, but she's
[1:09:24] strong.
[1:09:27] She's listened to every one of those
[1:09:28] sermons.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; You know, behind every great man is a
[1:09:33] great woman.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; And if we would call him the greatest
[1:09:37] preacher, we have the greatest
[1:09:39] preacher's wife
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; sitting with us. Let's give her a hand.
[1:09:59] The prophet says your birth here was
[1:10:01] pre-planned.
[1:10:03] I guess you believe that.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Every one of you knows that your birth
[1:10:07] is pre-planned.
[1:10:10] Did you know that your birth never
[1:10:13] originated as just a myth or a thought?
[1:10:17] Everything was all pre-planned by God
[1:10:20] before the foundational world that you
[1:10:24] would be here. The infinite God knowing
[1:10:29] and to be infinite he had to know every
[1:10:32] flea
[1:10:34] that would ever be in the earth and how
[1:10:37] many times it would bat its eye.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; That's infinite.
[1:10:43] Our little minds cannot fathom what
[1:10:47] infinite means. The infinite God, he
[1:10:52] knowed all things.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Therefore, there is nothing out of
[1:10:58] cater.
[1:11:08] Brother Bram talked to us in the
[1:11:09] unveiling of God and he says
[1:11:12] he said like a man building chimes
[1:11:16] or making chimes the molder
[1:11:19] every bell has got to ring different
[1:11:22] from the other.
[1:11:24] the same material that but so much iron
[1:11:28] and so much steel and so much brass to
[1:11:33] to give it the ting.
[1:11:37] That's the way God did. He bred this one
[1:11:40] to that one
[1:11:43] to this one and to that one to this one
[1:11:46] and to that one till he got exactly what
[1:11:50] he wanted.
[1:11:52] That's how he come down. God unveiled
[1:11:55] himself in a pillar of fire down through
[1:11:58] the prophets and then into the son of
[1:12:01] God which he was God. It's the same God
[1:12:05] bringing out exactly from perfection to
[1:12:09] perfection, from glory to glory.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; That's the way God does.
[1:12:17] Brother Biscll's voice,
[1:12:20] God made it in a certain way.
[1:12:24] If he is to be an ambassador to the
[1:12:26] earth,
[1:12:28] he has to have a certain thing.
[1:12:33] We heard as his life would go that he
[1:12:35] was almost like an orphan child.
[1:12:40] He never had a bedroom for his own.
[1:12:46] We hear him telling at 14 years old that
[1:12:48] he's sitting listening to the prophet of
[1:12:51] God and he watches a miracle before his
[1:12:54] eyes. A girl gets her sight
[1:12:58] and it did something to him.
[1:13:02] As a young man,
[1:13:05] he travels on a motorcycle
[1:13:08] and he almost says it with that
[1:13:10] something inside of him. a 500 bike
[1:13:15] shaved heads.
[1:13:20] He has an accident and he rolls
[1:13:24] and when he finds himself, he gets up
[1:13:26] and he doesn't have a scratch on him
[1:13:29] because God was watching over him.
[1:13:33] He sent him through many experiences
[1:13:39] because God
[1:13:42] had a ting that he was going to sound
[1:13:46] out.
[1:13:50] Hebrews chapter 11 says it like this.
[1:13:55] By faith the the harlot Rahab perished
[1:13:58] not with them that believe not. when she
[1:14:02] had received the spies with peace. And
[1:14:05] what shall I say more? For the time
[1:14:07] would fail me to tell of Gideon and Bay,
[1:14:10] and of Samson and Jeffi, and of David
[1:14:13] also, and Samuel of the prophets, who
[1:14:16] through faith subdued kingdoms,
[1:14:20] wrought righteousness, obtained the
[1:14:22] promises, and stopped the mouths of
[1:14:24] lions, quenched the violence of fire,
[1:14:27] escaped the edge of the sword, and out
[1:14:29] of weaknesses were made strong. lacks
[1:14:32] valued in fight turned to flight the
[1:14:35] armies of the aliens. Women received
[1:14:38] their dead, raised to life again. Others
[1:14:40] were tortured, not accepting
[1:14:42] deliverance, that they might obtain a
[1:14:44] better resurrection.
[1:14:46] Others had trial of cruel mockings and
[1:14:49] scourgings. Yay, moreover of bonds and
[1:14:51] imprisonment.
[1:14:53] They were stoned,
[1:14:56] were saw a sunder, were tempted, were
[1:14:59] slain with a sword. They wandered about
[1:15:02] in sheep skins and in goat skins, being
[1:15:05] destituted and afflicted and tormented
[1:15:09] of whom the world was not worthy. They
[1:15:11] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:15:13] dens and caves of the earth. And these
[1:15:17] all I cannot imagine the responsibility
[1:15:20] as Paul is writing this down. He's
[1:15:24] getting one chapter in the in the Bible
[1:15:27] to memorialize these people's lives.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; That's what it was. And these all having
[1:15:37] obtained a good report
[1:15:40] received not the promise. God having
[1:15:43] provided some better thing for us that
[1:15:46] they without us should not be made
[1:15:49] perfect.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Many years ago, 1986,
[1:15:55] Brother Biscll read this text and it
[1:15:57] changed my life.
[1:16:00] Wherefore, seeing we are compassed about
[1:16:02] with so great a cloud of witnesses, let
[1:16:05] us lay aside every weight,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:16:10] us, and let us run.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; You're left with the responsibility.
[1:16:15] Now,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; let us run.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Our prophet tells us that nobody has the
[1:16:21] same fingerprint. Nobody has the same
[1:16:24] eye that you have.
[1:16:27] Every one of us, nobody can take our
[1:16:29] place.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I can't do what you can do.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You can't do what I can do. None of us
[1:16:36] can be what brother Bisl was. And
[1:16:39] neither we do we want to be a carnal
[1:16:40] impersonation of him.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; But we want the same fire.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; We want that fire that's burning inside
[1:16:50] of us.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; That it's more than a quote.
[1:16:54] It's more than a sermon.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; It's more than a song.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It's a personal revelation. It's a
[1:17:03] personal experience with Almighty God.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; He's our personal bridegroom.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; We want that just not for oursel, but we
[1:17:16] want it for our family.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your excuse would be
[1:17:21] this morning for lagging back. Lay it
[1:17:23] aside.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Lay it aside. There's nothing worth
[1:17:28] staying here for.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; I've been hurt. Move on.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; I've been in danger. Move on.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Things have went bad for me. Move on.
[1:17:52] Five and a half years ago, I I came here
[1:17:55] in January
[1:17:59] and I'd been having some test run
[1:18:05] and just before Brother Tom picked me
[1:18:07] up, I got a call from the doctors.
[1:18:11] that I had cancer.
[1:18:15] I found it interesting that brother
[1:18:16] Biscll came to our local home church and
[1:18:20] brother Charlie Mitchell
[1:18:22] had had cancer in his left lung about
[1:18:26] the size of a fist. I knew knew I knew
[1:18:29] brother Charlie all my life but a real
[1:18:33] man real man of faith.
[1:18:39] Brother Biscllow came and they
[1:18:40] interviewed him at a at a television
[1:18:43] broadcast. The week before, Brother
[1:18:47] Andrew, the week before they had did a a
[1:18:50] governor's
[1:18:52] uh advertisement. It was a 302
[1:18:56] advertisement for the government for the
[1:18:58] governor.
[1:19:00] It took them an hour to put a 30 second
[1:19:03] piece together.
[1:19:05] Brother Biscll
[1:19:07] and Brother Charlie sat down
[1:19:11] and did a a a testimony. I believe
[1:19:15] that's about a half an hour long. They
[1:19:17] never took a break.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; And the producer said, "We we we have a
[1:19:24] hard time believing that you just did
[1:19:26] this."
[1:19:28] And we had the governor last week and it
[1:19:31] took us an hour to do a 302.
[1:19:34] And I love Brother Bisco's words. He
[1:19:37] said, "We were telling the truth.
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:58] I came to this service
[1:20:00] that evening, five minutes before
[1:20:05] And I'd already laid out the God had
[1:20:08] already laid out the service that
[1:20:10] evening I was going to preach on
[1:20:11] courage.
[1:20:16] Sister Connie was standing there when we
[1:20:18] got the call.
[1:20:20] Ron, you have cancer.
[1:20:24] And I just took a deep breath.
[1:20:28] I said, well, God's got this.
[1:20:32] I walked to this pull pit with brother
[1:20:34] Ed sitting here and you you guys sitting
[1:20:37] here and I preached on courage.
[1:20:45] Today I stand here 5 years later
[1:20:50] brain cancer, lung cancer,
[1:20:52] and now they're starting to find
[1:20:56] clean
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; clean scans.
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:14] Doctors tell you're going to die and
[1:21:17] they still tell me I'm going to die.
[1:21:20] And I just read another book. Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; I was with a doctor the other day and
[1:21:28] he's a bear of a man and he told me, he
[1:21:30] said,
[1:21:32] "Ron, you're a miracle. You don't look
[1:21:35] like you have cancer."
[1:21:37] And he said, "You're getting clear scans
[1:21:39] and that only tells you that the big
[1:21:41] stuff is not working. You're still on
[1:21:43] chemo. You're not in a wheelchair.
[1:21:45] You're not laying in a bed somewhere
[1:21:47] another. You're going to preach in
[1:21:49] Canada."
[1:21:51] And he just sat there with tears running
[1:21:53] down his eyes. He said, "You're a
[1:21:55] miracle."
[1:21:57] [Applause]
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more moments?
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; I've got a buddy sitting back here like
[1:22:15] a horse in a in a tray. He's ready.
[1:22:19] No matter how long I go, he's gonna go
[1:22:21] twice as long. So,
[1:22:25] I'm honored to stand with brother Tim
[1:22:27] Fry.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; In a special service, Brother Joe,
[1:22:41] you'll recognize, and I thought I would
[1:22:42] just take a portion here for a moment.
[1:22:45] There was a sermon called preach, let us
[1:22:47] run at your place. And brother Biscoll
[1:22:51] would come to a certain spot and he
[1:22:53] would begin to go over names that Satan
[1:22:56] hated
[1:22:58] that God used.
[1:23:01] And we talk about John Wesley
[1:23:04] that he would ride on horseback 15 miles
[1:23:06] a day.
[1:23:08] He would travel 250,000 miles. He spoke
[1:23:13] 42,000 sermons.
[1:23:16] He died at 88 years old
[1:23:20] and he wrote every one of his sermons
[1:23:22] down.
[1:23:24] A man named William Kerry
[1:23:29] was a great foreign mission.
[1:23:32] Brother Murphy, you'll appreciate this.
[1:23:34] He translated the Bible into 42
[1:23:38] different languages.
[1:23:41] He not only did that but he created
[1:23:44] dictionaries
[1:23:48] a man that I love a man named Carter
[1:23:51] Peter Cartwright
[1:23:53] and I remember when brother Biscll
[1:23:54] rehearsed this story
[1:23:58] he did it with quite an effort and quite
[1:24:01] a joy. Brother Brandham had mentioned
[1:24:03] him in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:24:06] and he'd went into a certain town and in
[1:24:08] this certain town there was a bully
[1:24:10] there and he was cleaning an old
[1:24:12] building that was abandoned. He was
[1:24:15] cleaning it up, cleaning the windows and
[1:24:16] cleaning the the lights over and he was
[1:24:19] up on a ladder and the bully comes in
[1:24:21] and says, "You'll not have a meeting in
[1:24:24] this town unless you whip me first."
[1:24:27] Well, Peter Cartwright just simply says,
[1:24:30] "I'll do that next."
[1:24:32] He gets down off of the ladder,
[1:24:36] rolls his sleeves up, and whips the town
[1:24:40] bully.
[1:24:42] History tells us that the town bully
[1:24:44] became the pastor of that church.
[1:24:49] Peter Cartright was also a politician
[1:24:55] and he ran in politics because he found
[1:24:58] out they were corrupt. They still are.
[1:25:02] But he ran against a man named Abraham
[1:25:04] Lincoln.
[1:25:06] And then in those days they would they
[1:25:09] would go from one square to another
[1:25:10] square in every town and and they'd give
[1:25:12] their speeches and people would come and
[1:25:15] and Peter Cartright was early and his
[1:25:18] competitor was
[1:25:20] at the next town giving a speech and he
[1:25:23] was talking about this Peter Cartright
[1:25:25] and if he could ever meet him he'd whip
[1:25:28] him on the spot.
[1:25:30] So Peter Cartwright spoke up.
[1:25:34] Do you know do you know Peter
[1:25:36] Cartwright? No, I've never met him. He
[1:25:38] said I'm Peter Cartwright.
[1:25:42] Said if if you don't come down here and
[1:25:44] whip me, you're a liar.
[1:25:47] And this whole audience will know you're
[1:25:49] a liar.
[1:25:52] So the man came down not realizing what
[1:25:55] Peter Cartright was capable of.
[1:25:58] And he whipped him. Peter Cartright just
[1:26:01] whipped him and thrashed him. remember
[1:26:03] he's a preacher.
[1:26:09] And when he got done, there was a river
[1:26:11] just across the road. And he announced
[1:26:13] to the folks, he said, "Now that I've
[1:26:15] whipped him, I'm going to baptize him."
[1:26:18] And took him across took him across the
[1:26:21] street and baptized him.
[1:26:28] He personally baptized 12,000 people.
[1:26:35] Brother Biscllow would rem mention
[1:26:37] George Whitefield,
[1:26:40] Jonathan Gford,
[1:26:42] Buddy Robinson, Brother Brother Tim and
[1:26:44] myself have preached in some of th those
[1:26:47] places. Buddy Robinson would be the man
[1:26:49] that would
[1:26:51] he would travel two two million miles.
[1:26:54] He would have a 100,000 conversions
[1:26:58] and he would preach 33,000 sermons.
[1:27:02] He would talk about Evan Roberts, Morai
[1:27:05] Ham, Billy Graham, Paul Ryder
[1:27:10] who produced the song Only Belief.
[1:27:14] He would talk about Charles Feny that
[1:27:17] 97% of his converts held. He was in
[1:27:21] Rochester, New York.
[1:27:23] Brother Brandon will talk about when
[1:27:24] Finey preached the power of God would be
[1:27:26] so great till 5 miles away men would
[1:27:29] drop their lunch pales and give their
[1:27:32] heart to God.
[1:27:34] The police didn't have nothing to do in
[1:27:36] that town because of the convergence
[1:27:38] that was going on and they became known
[1:27:40] as the barbershop quartets.
[1:27:48] All of these run the race.
[1:27:53] And I remember the charge that was given
[1:27:55] at the end of the service.
[1:27:57] What will you do?
[1:28:00] I'd say if we would stop today and
[1:28:04] rehearse all the milestones that brother
[1:28:08] Biscll accomplished.
[1:28:11] We would leave business out. we leave
[1:28:13] personal life out.
[1:28:16] I'd say he's in God's Hall of Fame
[1:28:18] today.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; If we took the time this evening to
[1:28:23] allow every one of us to give a personal
[1:28:26] story,
[1:28:28] I'd say every one of us have a personal
[1:28:32] story. I think the most unique thing
[1:28:35] about brother Ed is he made you feel
[1:28:39] like you were the greatest person in the
[1:28:40] world while you was talking to him.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; That's the mark of a great man.
[1:28:53] I was with him in one meeting and we had
[1:28:57] finished the meeting, Brother Ken.
[1:29:01] And we were walking down the steps and
[1:29:03] there was just hundreds of people.
[1:29:06] And he said, "Brother Ron, let's shake
[1:29:08] as many hands as we can shake."
[1:29:11] He said, "They may not remember anything
[1:29:14] that we preach, but we they will
[1:29:17] remember our handshake."
[1:29:21] I thought that was such phenomenal words
[1:29:24] of wisdom.
[1:29:27] Maybe you're missing revival in your
[1:29:29] life.
[1:29:33] Maybe you're missing in a personal
[1:29:34] experience in your life.
[1:29:38] But brother Biscoll's greatest goal was
[1:29:40] that every one of us,
[1:29:43] every one of us
[1:29:45] can have this same Jesus Christ living
[1:29:48] on the inside of us.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You see, if God has a plan and he has a
[1:29:54] purpose for brother Ed's life, he's got
[1:29:57] a purpose for your life.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; He's got a purpose. He made you. You
[1:30:02] said, "Well, Brother Ron, but I'm not a
[1:30:04] preacher." But you can do a certain
[1:30:06] work.
[1:30:08] I'm not a singer, but you can do a
[1:30:10] certain work.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; We have brother Dioa here, one of the
[1:30:17] greatest preachers that ever lived.
[1:30:20] Influenced by Brother Biscoff.
[1:30:23] All of us were touched by that.
[1:30:28] As I would close this morning,
[1:30:33] I'd like to just say this to you.
[1:30:36] Don't let this life,
[1:30:40] this ministry
[1:30:42] pass you by
[1:30:48] and not be touched by it.
[1:30:52] We can sit here today and understand
[1:30:55] what brother Bisll was remembered for.
[1:31:00] We'll never forget it.
[1:31:06] You'll hear brother Tom preach and every
[1:31:09] service he'll bring you a part of
[1:31:11] brother Ed.
[1:31:13] You'll hear brother Murphy preach and
[1:31:16] every sermon that he preach will be
[1:31:19] inspired
[1:31:20] and he will bring you a part of brother
[1:31:23] Biscll.
[1:31:26] I saved you for the last.
[1:31:31] Every time you hear brother Michael
[1:31:33] preach,
[1:31:34] you see he's a straight shooter.
[1:31:38] You'll not only hear brother Biscll
[1:31:41] through him,
[1:31:43] you'll see brother Biscll through him.
[1:31:48] The DNA genes are strong.
[1:32:02] As human beings,
[1:32:07] we're all wanting to hear these words
[1:32:13] from God.
[1:32:17] But I believe for my part of this
[1:32:20] meeting today,
[1:32:22] I'd like to say, Brother Ed Biscll,
[1:32:26] well done.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Can we say it together today?
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Well done.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:32:38] [Applause]
[1:33:00] just to change your posture just a
[1:33:02] moment. Won't you stand? Let's just go
[1:33:04] to prayer just for a moment and ask
[1:33:07] God's grace upon this portion of the
[1:33:10] service today.
[1:33:13] Father, we bow before your throne of
[1:33:16] grace
[1:33:18] and we want to say thanks
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; for all your many blessings to us.
[1:33:25] We want to thank you for lives that have
[1:33:27] went before us. For lives that we
[1:33:31] remember, the life of brother Bisco,
[1:33:34] Lord, that ran the race before us. We
[1:33:38] are all indebted today
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; for his life, his sacrifice, his love
[1:33:44] for you, and is sharing it with so many
[1:33:47] others.
[1:33:49] Lord, we're indebted to Calvary and what
[1:33:51] you did for us where you gave your life
[1:33:55] for us and you were the supreme example.
[1:33:59] And we love you, Lord. And we want to
[1:34:02] express our love to you today. We want
[1:34:05] to thank you Lord for this church, his
[1:34:08] family, Lord, its pastors that labor
[1:34:13] here for you. And we just ask Lord that
[1:34:16] you would give courage and strength and
[1:34:19] help. Oh God may that your spirit just
[1:34:24] be with them giving them comfort in the
[1:34:26] days ahead and strength as they go
[1:34:29] forward in your name. We ask it in Jesus
[1:34:32] name. Amen. God bless you. You can have
[1:34:36] your seats.
[1:34:40] I want to begin today by saying to
[1:34:44] Sister Ruth,
[1:34:46] to Sister Linda, Sister Marilyn,
[1:34:49] Sister Joanne, and to this great family,
[1:34:53] and to this host of friends
[1:34:56] that our hearts are deeply moved with
[1:34:59] you in this time of loss. it. It's a
[1:35:02] husband, a father, a grandfather, a
[1:35:05] spiritual leader that has finished his
[1:35:08] course and stepped into his reward.
[1:35:12] And we cannot really measure the weight
[1:35:15] of such a passing. For brother Biscll
[1:35:18] was more than a man. He was a father in
[1:35:21] the faith to countless souls. He was a
[1:35:24] steady hand in the ministry. He was a
[1:35:27] true general in the army of the Lord.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Ron Spencer told me that as
[1:35:33] he heard the news of his passing that he
[1:35:36] just wept all night. And I just tell
[1:35:39] you, my emotions were heartfelt, too.
[1:35:42] But really, I just sat stunned. Stunned
[1:35:46] because an era has passed and with it a
[1:35:50] responsibility is now laid on our
[1:35:52] shoulders.
[1:35:54] And to you, Sister Ruth, who stayed
[1:35:58] faithfully by his side through long
[1:36:01] years of labor. Your strength, your
[1:36:04] devotion, magnified his ministry. You
[1:36:08] are not only his companion, but a part
[1:36:11] of the very testimony of his life. Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; And to you, Sister Linda, Sister
[1:36:18] Marilyn, Sister Joanne,
[1:36:20] you shared your father with the world.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; And the world was richer for it,
[1:36:29] and his steady words, his faith, and his
[1:36:31] example will live on through you.
[1:36:36] And to you, brother Tom Ray,
[1:36:40] who now bears the mantle of pastoring,
[1:36:43] and to you, Brother Michael Ray, who
[1:36:47] follows as a grandson in the line of
[1:36:49] faith.
[1:36:50] May you feel both the burden and the
[1:36:53] blessing of carrying forward this great
[1:36:56] legacy.
[1:36:58] Just as Elisha once picked up Elijah's
[1:37:00] mantle, so too, the ministry is
[1:37:03] continuing in your hands.
[1:37:06] The scripture assures us that precious
[1:37:09] in the sight of the Lord is the death of
[1:37:10] his saints. And again he says, "Blessed
[1:37:14] are the dead which die in the Lord that
[1:37:16] they may rest from their labors and
[1:37:18] their works do follow them."
[1:37:21] Brother Biscoll's voice is silent here,
[1:37:24] but his works are still speaking.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; His testimony still stands.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; His influence still marches on in you,
[1:37:33] in this church. and his countless lives
[1:37:36] that he touched across the nations. And
[1:37:39] I want you to know that we we take this
[1:37:43] moment and we sorrow with you. But not
[1:37:47] as those who have no hope.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; But we know the trumpet will sound and
[1:37:51] we'll be reunited.
[1:37:54] And until then,
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; may the God of all comfort strengthen
[1:37:58] you. And may the legacy of brother Ed's
[1:38:00] faith continue to shine through your
[1:38:02] lives. And I say God bless you all.
[1:38:06] And as I begin today,
[1:38:10] my thoughts go, how do you even measure
[1:38:14] a loss like this?
[1:38:17] It is a loss that reaches far beyond
[1:38:20] these walls. It is actually felt around
[1:38:23] the world. And and when we try to put it
[1:38:25] into words, every word it just feels too
[1:38:30] small. our language falters. You know,
[1:38:33] there's nothing that really seems
[1:38:35] adequate to capture the depth, the
[1:38:38] weight of memory or the gratitude that
[1:38:42] we feel for life that was so greatly
[1:38:45] lived.
[1:38:46] Today, we honor a mighty man whose
[1:38:49] course is now finished,
[1:38:52] whose crown is sure. Brother Biscll has
[1:38:55] joined that great cloud of witnesses and
[1:38:58] and and his voice now rests. But his
[1:39:01] influence echoes on. His shoes can't be
[1:39:06] filled. But the trail he blazed is still
[1:39:10] before us. His fire, his burden, his
[1:39:14] faith remains as a charge to us who are
[1:39:17] yet still running this race.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; And today we stand in the shadow of a
[1:39:23] great absence. A mighty general, a
[1:39:26] soldier of the cross has gone on. a
[1:39:30] pioneer of the message, a witness of
[1:39:33] truth, and the gap in our ranks is
[1:39:37] undeniable.
[1:39:39] It leaves us with hard questions. Where
[1:39:43] are we in time?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Where do we go from here? Who will rise
[1:39:48] to carry the banner that he so
[1:39:51] faithfully bore? And and here's the
[1:39:55] obvious truth. His shoes can't be filled
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; yet through his voice. Though his voice
[1:40:01] is now stealed on this side of eternity,
[1:40:04] the echo of it still remains and will be
[1:40:07] forever engraved in our hearts
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; because he imparted something to us of
[1:40:13] eternal quality.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; The fire in that he ignited in many is
[1:40:19] still burns. And his burden for the
[1:40:22] gospel now seemed to rest on our
[1:40:25] shoulders. And I think it's a shared
[1:40:28] burden today.
[1:40:30] The the the trail that he blazed it
[1:40:33] calls for us to walk in it with the same
[1:40:36] faith and the courage that he showed.
[1:40:39] The scripture in Hebrews 13:7 reminds
[1:40:42] us, "Remember them which have the rule
[1:40:45] over you that have spoken to you the
[1:40:47] word of God whose faith follow consern
[1:40:50] considering the end of their
[1:40:52] conversation."
[1:40:53] And this is our charge today to
[1:40:56] remember. It's what we're doing here in
[1:40:59] this service to remember, to reflect,
[1:41:03] and to follow. And when we look at
[1:41:05] brother Biscll's end, what do we see?
[1:41:08] Not regret, but reward. Not failure, but
[1:41:13] fruitfulness.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Not silence, but a legacy that speaks.
[1:41:18] And today I I find myself echoing the
[1:41:21] cry of King Joash at the bedside of
[1:41:25] Elisha. And his cry has become my own
[1:41:29] cry in this moment. And from this
[1:41:32] scripture is what I long to impart to
[1:41:36] his family, to ministers that are here,
[1:41:41] fellow ministers and friends, and even
[1:41:44] to the bride of Christ around the world.
[1:41:47] For when Joash, the king of Israel, came
[1:41:50] to Elisha's bedside as he was dying, he
[1:41:54] fell on him and wept, crying, "Oh my
[1:41:58] father, my father, the chariot of Israel
[1:42:02] and the horsemen thereof."
[1:42:05] And it is from here that I want to take
[1:42:07] my text
[1:42:09] because truly a great man has departed
[1:42:12] from us. A spiritual father, a man of
[1:42:16] direction, a warrior of the word.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; He was in his time, you know, a the
[1:42:23] chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[1:42:26] thereof. Not because he rode with
[1:42:28] armies, but because he walked with God.
[1:42:32] And this is, you know, these words that
[1:42:35] Joash would use that Elisha actually
[1:42:38] would use concerning Elijah when and his
[1:42:41] departed. This wasn't just flattery. It
[1:42:43] was a profound recognition of the true
[1:42:46] strength, defense, and the power of
[1:42:50] Israel. You see, in the ancient world,
[1:42:53] the chariots and horsemen were the most
[1:42:56] powerful weapons of warfare. They were
[1:42:59] the tanks of the battlefield. They
[1:43:02] represented strength and swiftness and
[1:43:05] and national security. So when Joash
[1:43:09] called Elisha the the chariot and the
[1:43:12] horsemen of Israel, he was saying, "You,
[1:43:15] Elisha, are the real power behind
[1:43:19] Israel. You are more than an army. You
[1:43:22] are our defense."
[1:43:24] You see, it wasn't Israel's horses and
[1:43:28] chariots that gave it power, but it was
[1:43:31] the prophetic presence of God in his
[1:43:34] servant.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Elisha wasn't a general. He didn't fight
[1:43:38] in the Israel's army, but through his
[1:43:40] prayers, the miracles, his access to
[1:43:44] God's voice, he was the spiritual force
[1:43:48] that defended the nation. He discerned
[1:43:51] the enemy's movements. He struck armies
[1:43:54] blind. He opened the eyes of his servant
[1:43:58] to angelic host. And he showed that
[1:44:00] there were angels of fire and horses of
[1:44:04] fire and that God was on their side and
[1:44:07] that they were more than enough.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; You see, his intercession and authority,
[1:44:12] it brought deliverance to Israel more
[1:44:14] than any natural weapon. And oh God, I
[1:44:19] say to Jay, we need some spiritual
[1:44:22] fathers.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Fathers who can discern and withstand
[1:44:26] the antichrist. That is replacing the
[1:44:29] spirit with formality and with rituals
[1:44:32] and replacing the word with vain
[1:44:34] philosophies who turn truth into fables.
[1:44:39] And like a chariot steered by the
[1:44:41] skilled hands, Elisha was a a guiding
[1:44:44] force. And the king would look to him in
[1:44:47] times of natural distress for strategy,
[1:44:51] for assurance, and for supernatural
[1:44:54] intervention. And when Elisha was about
[1:44:56] to die, Joash wept. Not just because a
[1:45:01] man was dying, but because a nation was
[1:45:04] losing its eyes, its ears, its spiritual
[1:45:08] commander.
[1:45:09] And now my words shift
[1:45:12] not to the mighty man of God who has
[1:45:16] been recently taken home, but to us who
[1:45:19] remain. His course is finished.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; His crown is sure,
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; but what about us?
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; What will we do with the mantle that has
[1:45:29] fallen at our feet?
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; For surely you know that much has been
[1:45:34] passed on. It certainly wasn't taken to
[1:45:37] the grave with him. It was passed on in
[1:45:40] the lives of many of you men and women
[1:45:42] here today. And if there was ever a time
[1:45:46] for men and boys to rise to the
[1:45:49] challenge, it is now. Cuz we don't just
[1:45:52] need males. We need men of God. We don't
[1:45:57] just need providers. We need fathers.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need men who will stand in the
[1:46:03] gap. Men who will take responsibility,
[1:46:07] men who will sound the trumpet with
[1:46:10] clarity.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said in the book of
[1:46:13] Ezekiel, "And I sought for a man." I
[1:46:16] want you to listen to these words. Let
[1:46:18] them be immortalized on your life today.
[1:46:22] I sought for a man among them that
[1:46:24] should make up the hedge then stand in
[1:46:27] the gap before me in the land. This was
[1:46:31] the words of a prophet. And God was
[1:46:35] speaking through him. And he says, "I
[1:46:37] sought for a man."
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? A man,
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; not a wimp,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; not a coward,
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; not a boy in a man's body, but a man. A
[1:46:49] man forged by conviction, tempered by
[1:46:53] the word, anchored in righteousness,
[1:46:56] unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:00] I'll tell you, God ain't searching for
[1:47:02] for crowds and programs and somebody's
[1:47:05] committee. He's searching for a man,
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; strong man, men of courage, men with a
[1:47:12] vision,
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; not grown infants, but men. Men in the
[1:47:18] faith, men of conviction, men with
[1:47:22] courage who will take up the hedge and
[1:47:25] stand in the gap.
[1:47:27] Ezekiel was calling for this someone to
[1:47:31] make up the hedge.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; A hedge was a wall of defense. And when
[1:47:37] it was broken, the enemy could could
[1:47:40] rush in. And this is what fathers are.
[1:47:44] They're walls of defense. They are
[1:47:46] protectors of the next generation. They
[1:47:49] are intercessors for their family and
[1:47:52] for the church. And when we lose
[1:47:55] fathers, We lose vision. When fatherhood
[1:47:59] is absent, the trumpet begins to sound,
[1:48:03] an uncertain sound, and soldiers then
[1:48:06] scatter, not knowing which way to go.
[1:48:09] Without fathers to steady the ranks,
[1:48:12] many will turn their backs to the
[1:48:14] battle, or worse, they'll lay down their
[1:48:17] weapons in surrender. God said, "I need
[1:48:21] a man.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I need a man to make up the hedge.
[1:48:25] someone to repair the breach, to fill
[1:48:29] the gap, to stand like a wall of
[1:48:32] intercession, of righteousness and
[1:48:34] courage between the people and
[1:48:37] destruction. Well, it takes strength to
[1:48:39] build. It takes sacrifice to repair. It
[1:48:43] takes a man of God to stand when others
[1:48:46] are running.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, this is no time to
[1:48:50] retreat.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; This is no hour to hesitate. This is a
[1:48:55] moment for men to rise, to make up the
[1:48:58] hedge, to stand where the wall is
[1:49:00] broken, to hold the line
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; until Christ returns. And if there ever
[1:49:06] was an hour for men of righteousness to
[1:49:09] step forward, men who will not bow, men
[1:49:13] who will not burn out, but men who will
[1:49:16] not compromise. It is now that we need
[1:49:20] men to step forward,
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; fill in the gap. Yeah.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul said
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; as he commanded us and this was a
[1:49:30] command. Watch ye and I'm going to take
[1:49:32] some of these words. Watch ye stand in
[1:49:36] the faith. Quit ye like men. Be strong.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Men of faith, men of vision, men who
[1:49:48] don't quit, men of strength and
[1:49:51] integrity. Look at the Paul Paul's
[1:49:54] admonition where he says he says watch
[1:49:57] ye you know men like brother Biscoll
[1:50:01] they were the watchmen of the night they
[1:50:04] were watchmen up on the walls who warned
[1:50:08] of the coming dangers who guided others
[1:50:11] in their battle.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Matthew 26 he said watch
[1:50:16] and pray that you enter not into
[1:50:19] temptation. Peter would say, "Be sober,
[1:50:22] be vigilant, because your adversary, the
[1:50:26] devil, as a ruined lion, walketh about
[1:50:29] seeking those whom he may devour."
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; You see, a sleeping watchman endangers
[1:50:36] the whole city,
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; and a sleeping father leaves his home
[1:50:41] defenseless.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; And the first call is, "Wake up.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Come to attention.
[1:50:48] Watch.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be observant. Be diligent. Be
[1:50:53] involved.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Stand fast in the faith.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; To stand faith means hold the line.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Refuse to retreat. Anchor yourself on
[1:51:05] solid ground.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Philippians said, you know, Paul said in
[1:51:09] Philippians, stand fast in one spirit,
[1:51:11] one mind, striving together for the
[1:51:14] faith of the gospel. Ephesians 6 says,
[1:51:17] "Haven't done all to stand.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Stand therefore."
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means don't bend when when
[1:51:25] the culture pressures you.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Don't shift when whims of doctrines
[1:51:30] blow.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Plant your feet on the word of God and
[1:51:35] say, "I will not be moved from this
[1:51:39] solid foundation."
[1:51:42] And then he says, "Quit ye like men."
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; And this is an old phrase meaning act
[1:51:50] like men.
[1:51:52] Conduct yourself with courage. Rise to
[1:51:55] manhood.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Don't shrink." Here's what
[1:51:59] he's saying. Don't shrink. Don't cower.
[1:52:01] Don't act like children. Be men.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be fathers who nurture. Be
[1:52:08] protectors who shield.
[1:52:10] Be warriors who fight.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Be priests who pray.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is exactly what Ezekiel was
[1:52:18] crying for. A man to stand in the gap.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; It's not an hour for hesitation.
[1:52:25] This is no season for retreat.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; You see, heaven is calling for men of
[1:52:31] courage, men with conviction, men with
[1:52:34] faith to stand forward and take their
[1:52:37] place.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we lose fathers
[1:52:42] and fatherhood,
[1:52:44] and I'm talking about real men of God
[1:52:47] now,
[1:52:49] uh we lose something invaluable. We we
[1:52:52] lose our our vision. Without fathers,
[1:52:55] the trumpet of the spirit begins to
[1:52:57] sound with uncertain notes, uncertain
[1:53:01] sounds, and the word becomes muffled and
[1:53:04] and the direction becomes blurred and
[1:53:08] and the church becomes confused about
[1:53:11] which way to march. That's right.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; And instead of advancing, there are too
[1:53:16] many that are retreating.
[1:53:18] Instead of facing the enemy head on,
[1:53:21] some are turning their backs and running
[1:53:23] with fear, while others are laying down
[1:53:26] their weapons and surrender. Too
[1:53:29] complacent, too lukewarm, not fervent in
[1:53:32] spirit.
[1:53:34] You see, a father's presence brings
[1:53:38] clarity.
[1:53:39] A father's voice, a father's voice
[1:53:43] steadies the ranks. And when fathers
[1:53:47] fall silent, sons stumble.
[1:53:51] And when trumpets lose their sound,
[1:53:55] soldiers scatter.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; And when real men of faith no longer
[1:54:00] stand, then the line of battle is
[1:54:03] broken.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Elisha cried these same words over
[1:54:09] Elijah at his rapture. And now Joash
[1:54:13] will use them and say them over Elisha
[1:54:16] repeat repeat repeating the same word
[1:54:18] because he carried the same spirit.
[1:54:22] And he was showing that this phrase was
[1:54:24] used to acknowledge a prophet's heavenly
[1:54:27] worth, their unseen but supreme role in
[1:54:31] the nation. These men would stand
[1:54:34] between heaven and earth. men anointed
[1:54:38] not just with words but with a divine
[1:54:41] commission.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say brother Biscll
[1:54:45] was a father.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; He was more than a preacher.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; He was a father.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And Paul wrote and and and he said in
[1:54:55] Corinthians, he said, "No, you have
[1:54:57] 10,000 instructors in Christ, yet you
[1:55:00] have not many fathers. For in Christ
[1:55:03] Jesus, I have begotten you through the
[1:55:06] gospel.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; That was brother Ed.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; He was a father in the faith.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; He was a spiritual patriarch
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; to us all.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was he he would mentor with
[1:55:20] grace. He strengthened with wisdom. He
[1:55:23] encouraged us with with a unshakable
[1:55:26] vision.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He kept his eyes on the mission to
[1:55:31] get the message into the hearts and the
[1:55:34] and the hands of the people of God. That
[1:55:38] was his goal. That was his vision. That
[1:55:40] was the driving force. Get the message.
[1:55:43] Get this word in their hands. Let it
[1:55:46] then get in their hearts. Then it will
[1:55:48] transform lives and then there therefore
[1:55:51] transform a world.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you about this man. He wasn't
[1:55:55] interested in building his own kingdom.
[1:55:59] He didn't gather men to himself.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; He pointed them to Christ
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; and he did his very best everywhere he
[1:56:06] went. When he left, it wasn't his
[1:56:09] sermons he left. It wasn't his tapes.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; It wasn't his It wasn't him that he
[1:56:15] tried to multiply and increase. No sir,
[1:56:19] he he kept his eyes on one mission. His
[1:56:22] his eye was single. get this message
[1:56:26] into the hands and the hearts of the
[1:56:28] people.
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't gather men to himself.
[1:56:35] He pointed them to Christ. He did his
[1:56:38] best to equip and release them into
[1:56:40] harvest.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; His zeal for the truth was unmatched and
[1:56:48] his passion was contagious and his
[1:56:51] legacy immeasurable. Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; And these are not just mere words.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; They're words that I pinned from the
[1:57:04] Holy Spirit and speak to you today.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Through his life, the message was
[1:57:11] translated into hundreds of languages.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just content
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; for to stay with these four walls.
[1:57:20] That's right.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; It wasn't about building a kingdom here.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; It was about God's kingdom,
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; reaching everyone. He Heard the call
[1:57:30] that he would have a people out of every
[1:57:32] nation from tribe and people. He He
[1:57:36] lived that. He believed that. He wanted
[1:57:38] you to hear it and experience this
[1:57:41] living God for yourself.
[1:57:44] And that was his legacy
[1:57:48] as his true his for truth was unmatched.
[1:57:54] He wasn't just a man of ideas.
[1:57:57] He was a man of impact.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; He'd get an idea. He'd get a catch a
[1:58:03] vision of something like the hub as you
[1:58:05] were talking about and start out with a
[1:58:07] kiosk and and and and then talk to the
[1:58:10] different one. You're not getting it.
[1:58:12] You're not getting what I You're not
[1:58:13] getting it.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; I want this where all the world, anybody
[1:58:18] can read it in their language.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Anybody can receive this. He was a man
[1:58:25] of impact.
[1:58:27] And when Joash cried out to Elisha, "My
[1:58:31] father, my father, the chariot of
[1:58:33] Israel, and the horsemen thereof," he
[1:58:35] was declaring, "You're our strength.
[1:58:38] You're our defender, our guide, our
[1:58:40] hope. You're the one who has bore the
[1:58:42] weight of the battles. You You're the
[1:58:44] one who's carried us further than what
[1:58:46] our strength could ever have done.
[1:58:49] And this isn't just the cry for a
[1:58:52] prophet or for a pastor.
[1:58:56] It is the cry
[1:58:58] we should utter for every true father.
[1:59:03] Let me talk about fathers just for a
[1:59:06] moment.
[1:59:10] You see, a father in the home is not
[1:59:14] just a provider of bread.
[1:59:17] He is a guardian of purpose,
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; the builder of confidence,
[1:59:23] the chariot that carries his family
[1:59:25] through the battlefield of life. And
[1:59:28] like a chariot, he carries the weight,
[1:59:31] the weight of prayer, provision,
[1:59:33] protection, and discipline.
[1:59:36] Like a horseman, he he will charge
[1:59:38] ahead, leading by example with courage
[1:59:41] and stability and clarity.
[1:59:44] And when a father is present and
[1:59:46] engaged,
[1:59:48] his children can ride on his strength.
[1:59:52] His home is not left just to drift. It's
[1:59:55] driven with a purpose.
[1:59:58] He and no doubt mother too are are the
[2:00:00] first preacher that is his children
[2:00:03] here. the first protector they trust,
[2:00:07] the first counselor they can fight in.
[2:00:11] And then there are spiritual fathers,
[2:00:13] the horsemen of the church and the
[2:00:15] chariots, the tanks of the battle. A
[2:00:18] spiritual father is like one like uh
[2:00:21] Elisha. He hears from God. He speaks the
[2:00:24] word. He he guides others in their
[2:00:26] calling. And he's not he's not
[2:00:28] interested in followers for himself. But
[2:00:31] what he's interested in is raising sons.
[2:00:34] equipping soldiers
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; for the battle. And he doesn't carry
[2:00:39] swords and shields. He He carries
[2:00:42] intercession and revelation.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't lead the charge and to
[2:00:48] natural war, but in spiritual realms.
[2:00:50] We're talking about spiritual fathers,
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; binding devils, breaking strongholds,
[2:00:56] guiding the army of the Lord. And I want
[2:00:59] to tell you, you've had a father in this
[2:01:01] church. Brother Biscllow was a leader,
[2:01:04] one who led revival, as a word got into
[2:01:08] our hands as as a message would become
[2:01:10] available and the weight of me of the
[2:01:13] message came upon that era and we went
[2:01:16] from the surface to to the depths of
[2:01:18] God. And the message burned in his like
[2:01:23] fire in his bones and he couldn't be
[2:01:25] quiet about it.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had a passion that drove him
[2:01:30] and there was a flame of fire that
[2:01:32] burned within him. And let me tell you,
[2:01:34] it wasn't contained within him. He set
[2:01:36] everybody else around him on fire, too.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; He inspired ministers
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; and others to spread the message, to do
[2:01:44] their part.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, when a man like that
[2:01:49] is gone, you feel it.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; You feel the void.
[2:01:57] Because you're not just losing a
[2:01:59] preacher, you're losing a pillar,
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; a strategist, a voice that helped to
[2:02:06] shape your life.
[2:02:09] And just like Elisha stood between
[2:02:11] Israel and defeat, fathers stand between
[2:02:14] their children and chaos,
[2:02:18] between the church and deception,
[2:02:21] between the young and destruction. They
[2:02:24] are the intercessors, coverings,
[2:02:27] visionaries, gatekeepers.
[2:02:30] You see, a father may not always be in
[2:02:32] the spotlight, but when he's gone, the
[2:02:35] cry goes out from thy father, my father,
[2:02:38] the chariot of Israel, the horsemen
[2:02:40] thereof.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Because why? Because you realize he
[2:02:44] carried you more than you knew.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; He fought battles you never saw. He bore
[2:02:51] burdens and silence. He brought you
[2:02:53] further than you could have gone on your
[2:02:56] own.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; And the failure of fathers,
[2:03:02] whether through absence, disengagement,
[2:03:06] abandonment of responsibility, or
[2:03:08] spiritual negligence,
[2:03:11] it has devastating effects on both
[2:03:14] individual lives and even on the fabric
[2:03:17] of society.
[2:03:19] The moral decay
[2:03:21] is because
[2:03:24] of the lack of fathers.
[2:03:27] Real men.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; We need real men.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; We need fathers, real men of God. We
[2:03:35] need them not to be passive,
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; but we we need them to be engaged and
[2:03:41] active and standing in the gap for our
[2:03:43] family. We need men in this church, men
[2:03:46] around the world that'll be fathers,
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; stand in the gap.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible, history, and modern study, it
[2:03:55] all confirms this. It is a very sobering
[2:03:58] truth. When fathers fail, the foundation
[2:04:02] of nations weakens.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; And here's a breakdown. Let me just take
[2:04:08] just for a moment and just break down
[2:04:10] the dangers of a nation or society that
[2:04:14] they face.
[2:04:16] And as I do, let me be clear
[2:04:22] in speaking today about fathers.
[2:04:25] I I'm not at all trying to minimize the
[2:04:28] role of women and mothers.
[2:04:31] Their place is vital, irreplaceable, and
[2:04:35] honored by God.
[2:04:37] Where would we be if it wouldn't be for
[2:04:39] wonderful godly women in our church,
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; in our lives, in our families?
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Women like Sister Ruth Biscll
[2:04:50] who stood gallantly beside her man and
[2:04:52] labored with him.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; And she too stands as an example of
[2:04:57] godliness. And I I just pray God
[2:05:00] continue to comfort you and bless you
[2:05:02] today
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; for your godly life and example and what
[2:05:06] you have given to the Lord because
[2:05:08] you've given much
[2:05:10] the family
[2:05:15] as we go back to this thought of
[2:05:19] fatherhood
[2:05:20] of why we're here today though we're
[2:05:23] here to remember a father
[2:05:26] a great man of God.
[2:05:29] And it is right, it's only right to
[2:05:32] emphasize the strength and the vision
[2:05:35] that fathers bring. Even as we fully
[2:05:39] recognize how essential mothers are in
[2:05:42] God's design, the family is the building
[2:05:46] block of any society.
[2:05:49] The fathers are the pillars of that
[2:05:51] foundation.
[2:05:53] The scripture upon which our message
[2:05:55] hinges is found in Malachi 4:6. And he
[2:05:59] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[2:06:02] the children, and the hearts of the
[2:06:04] children to their fathers, lest I come
[2:06:07] and smite the earth with a curse.
[2:06:11] And the this this verse even shows us
[2:06:14] how critical that fathers are to God's
[2:06:17] plan.
[2:06:19] You see, it it shows that when the
[2:06:22] hearts of the fathers are rightly turned
[2:06:25] toward their children in love, in
[2:06:28] guidance and nurture, in in spiritual
[2:06:31] leadership, that there is a blessing,
[2:06:34] stability and life.
[2:06:37] But when fathers turn away from their
[2:06:38] home, when they neglect their
[2:06:40] responsibility to protect and to
[2:06:43] nurture, when they withhold their
[2:06:46] presence and their love, the result is
[2:06:50] not blessing, but it's a curse.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; And a father's absence leaves a vacuum.
[2:06:57] His neglect breaks that hedge of
[2:07:00] protection we talked about around the
[2:07:02] family. The heart of a child that should
[2:07:05] have been strengthened by love instead
[2:07:08] becomes wounded by neglect.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; And when enough fathers abandon their
[2:07:14] role, this curse just spreads. And it's
[2:07:17] not just in one home, but it's in then
[2:07:19] you find it in an entire society that
[2:07:22] becomes corrupted because fathers let
[2:07:25] down on their responsibility.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Malachi though gives us hope. He says
[2:07:31] God in promises a restoration, a turning
[2:07:35] of hearts that when fathers return to
[2:07:38] their God-given roles, when children's
[2:07:41] hearts are restored to their fathers,
[2:07:44] even then the curse is broken and the
[2:07:46] blessings can flow again.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; But without fathers, families become
[2:07:51] fractured. Children grow up without
[2:07:54] discipline, without identity or
[2:07:57] spiritual guidance. marriages and will
[2:08:00] they will lack stability and leadership
[2:08:03] and a broken home al often becomes the
[2:08:06] seedbed of broken communities.
[2:08:10] And let me tell you when fathers are
[2:08:13] absent or disengaged
[2:08:17] children will struggle with self where
[2:08:20] they will they will struggle with
[2:08:22] self-worth and with identity. They'll
[2:08:26] seek belonging in gangs,
[2:08:29] ideologies, and addictions.
[2:08:31] They they'll lack that emotional
[2:08:35] resilience and discipline. You see, a
[2:08:38] father gives a child a name. It gives
[2:08:41] him affirmation. He sets boundaries and
[2:08:44] without that confusion,
[2:08:47] confusion reigns. And this Sodom world
[2:08:50] has produced a generation of lost men
[2:08:54] who don't know their identity.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; And this is especially true of young men
[2:09:00] who either withdraw into, you know,
[2:09:04] hiding in their dark rooms many times on
[2:09:06] the dark web, spending their hours, you
[2:09:10] know, gaming and senseless nonsense and
[2:09:13] wasting their lives. or or either they
[2:09:16] will they will do that or they'll lash
[2:09:18] out in aggression. And it's all stemming
[2:09:22] from an inward cry, where is my father?
[2:09:28] And numerous studies have confirmed that
[2:09:30] the fatherless is directly connected to
[2:09:35] increased rates of juvenile delinquency,
[2:09:38] higher likelihood of incarceration,
[2:09:42] greater prevalence of violence and
[2:09:44] rebellion.
[2:09:46] Proverbs 13 said, "He that spareth his
[2:09:49] rod hateth his son, but he that loveth
[2:09:52] him chastises him times." And without
[2:09:56] fathers
[2:09:58] to discipline and direct, the conscience
[2:10:01] of a generation becomes uncon
[2:10:04] uncultivated and unrestrained and it
[2:10:07] brings about a moral decline and a
[2:10:11] spiritual decline. You see, fathers are
[2:10:14] meant to be priests of the home.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; They are to guide their families in
[2:10:19] truth.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; They are to lead them in righteousness.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when they abandon this role,
[2:10:27] children grow up with no reverence for
[2:10:29] God, no fear of God. Amen. And homes
[2:10:33] will lack prayer and and the word and
[2:10:35] worship. And the church then becomes
[2:10:38] weakened trying to compensate for what
[2:10:41] should have been taught at home.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, you see fathers, you
[2:10:48] know, remind they pass to you the
[2:10:51] stories of the past generation. The the
[2:10:55] it gives you a sense of heritage. in the
[2:10:58] book of Judges said that there arose
[2:11:01] another generation after them which knew
[2:11:04] not the Lord nor yet the works which he
[2:11:06] had done for Israel.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Well, how did this happen? How does an
[2:11:11] entire generation forget the God who
[2:11:15] parted the sea,
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; who thundered on Mount Si?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; How do they forget a God who made walls
[2:11:23] to fall and giants to flee? How do they
[2:11:26] forget a god like that?
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; It happens when men when fathers quit
[2:11:31] telling the stories.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; When testimonies grow silent, when
[2:11:37] faith, you see, that's when faith begins
[2:11:39] to die. We must have the testimonies of
[2:11:43] the fathers.
[2:11:45] Amen.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; And when the memories of God's power are
[2:11:48] no longer spoken, then miracles become a
[2:11:51] myth.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; And revelation turns to religion.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Let me just quote to you from a special
[2:12:03] friend of mine, Brother Benjamin Puit of
[2:12:05] Hardy, Arkansas. We're no relation. We,
[2:12:08] you know, he's not his family wouldn't
[2:12:10] horse thieves because they spell the
[2:12:12] name the same.
[2:12:15] So, brother Benjamin Puit wrote this and
[2:12:18] I want to say it because I couldn't say
[2:12:20] it better and because it was a heartfelt
[2:12:23] tribute that I want to bring to you just
[2:12:26] from the one of millions from around the
[2:12:29] world that would love to express their
[2:12:32] appreciation today
[2:12:35] if they were stood in my shoes. But he
[2:12:38] shared the impact of this ministry
[2:12:42] and he said what a what a profound
[2:12:46] influence brother Biscll had on my
[2:12:48] generation from sermons like idols
[2:12:52] crafted from the message
[2:12:54] Rahab's secret
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; and he said my favorite the value of the
[2:12:59] flaw
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; to the massive amount of work he did to
[2:13:02] spread the message here and overseas he
[2:13:05] will be greatly missed by all of us. He
[2:13:08] will be forever the young man in the
[2:13:12] checkered shirt, a witness to his
[2:13:15] generation that Jesus Christ is the same
[2:13:19] yesterday, today, and forever. Well
[2:13:21] done, faithful servant. Welcome home.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; You see, we need fathers though who
[2:13:29] testify.
[2:13:32] nearly three and a half, four hours. The
[2:13:34] last I would say probably the last
[2:13:36] convention sermon brother preached. He
[2:13:39] preached in my church at the dedication
[2:13:42] and for nearly four hours we sat
[2:13:45] spellbound
[2:13:47] as he described
[2:13:49] that moment as I sat on a log.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; And he shared with us
[2:13:56] the change, what had impacted his life,
[2:13:59] what had given him vision, what had
[2:14:02] given him the drive, what had given him
[2:14:05] the passion.
[2:14:07] And I'll tell you, we need fathers who
[2:14:10] testify. Men who have a testimony
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; that they too met God
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; that they're not even testifying of
[2:14:17] another generation, but they can bring
[2:14:19] it right out into their own life. I met
[2:14:22] God and he changed me
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; and you too can have this change.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; We need fathers, natural and spiritual,
[2:14:30] who open their mouths and declare, "Let
[2:14:33] me tell you what God did for me.
[2:14:36] Let me tell you how he healed. Let me
[2:14:38] tell you how he saved. Let me tell you
[2:14:40] how he delivers.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you when the fire fell and
[2:14:44] the word came alive and that day that
[2:14:47] heaven opened to me,
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; not a drag doctrine,
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; not borrowed phrases,
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; but a living testimony of a living
[2:14:56] Christ.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; That was the power of brother Ed Biscll.
[2:15:01] Hallelujah.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; One of his greatest values to this
[2:15:04] generation was not just his knowledge of
[2:15:07] the message,
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; but the life that was poured out of his
[2:15:12] testimonies.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; When he spoke, you didn't just hear
[2:15:17] about the word.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; You felt its weight.
[2:15:22] You tasted of his freshness.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; You You burned with his fire.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; He didn't speak as a man. Recall in
[2:15:29] history. He spoke as a man who had
[2:15:31] walked in it, bled in it, prayed in it,
[2:15:33] and seen the supernatural hand of God
[2:15:36] move again and again. And he reminded us
[2:15:39] that God doesn't just reveal truth. He
[2:15:42] demonstrates it.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; And he taught us that when revelation
[2:15:47] touches the heart, it becomes more than
[2:15:50] information to us. It it becomes a a an
[2:15:54] ignition. It ignites our faith. It puts
[2:15:58] a a fire in our lives.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscom believed and proved that
[2:16:03] revelation
[2:16:05] revelation was not just to sit cold on a
[2:16:08] shelf.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; It was meant to burn in the heart,
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; to empower the church,
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; to drive men to their knees, to raise up
[2:16:19] sons and daughters who will carry the to
[2:16:22] the torch forward.
[2:16:24] He taught us that truth isn't fully
[2:16:26] known until it's lived.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; That the word comes with power, not just
[2:16:32] to inform us, but to transform us.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't come with a lecture. He
[2:16:38] came as a man anointed.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anointed, sent forth by God,
[2:16:45] empowered by the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I tell you today, don't let the
[2:16:53] stories die. If we don't tell them, if
[2:16:56] we don't recount the wonders, if we
[2:16:58] don't stir the remembrance of what God
[2:17:01] has done in this generation, there will
[2:17:03] be another generation who will rise, who
[2:17:07] knows not the Lord nor his mighty works.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; But I say, but not on our watch.
[2:17:17] Amen.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; I say, let fathers arise. Let the
[2:17:22] testimonies of God's goodness flow.
[2:17:25] Amen. Let the next generation hear the
[2:17:28] stories, not of a dead religion, but of
[2:17:31] a living God who changes and transforms
[2:17:34] lives. That you can never be the same
[2:17:37] again. Once that fire has touched your
[2:17:40] heart, tell him how he saved you. Tell
[2:17:43] him how he healed you. Tell him how he
[2:17:45] delivered you. Tell him how he revealed
[2:17:48] himself in this hour. Don't be ashamed
[2:17:50] of the gospel of Christ. It is the power
[2:17:53] of God into salvation.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; And in doing so, you'll pass the flame
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; and you'll keep the fire burning.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 3, you can read it. It
[2:18:05] gives a terrifying picture
[2:18:08] of a nation under judgment.
[2:18:12] The mighty men are removed.
[2:18:14] The children becomes rulers.
[2:18:17] People oppressed by each others. Youth
[2:18:21] rise up against their elders.
[2:18:24] And this is what happens when fatherhood
[2:18:27] is lost. Both will literally and
[2:18:31] symbolically you know the the nation
[2:18:33] becomes disordered, disrespected, dis
[2:18:36] destabilized.
[2:18:38] And when spiritual fathers
[2:18:41] fail to mentor, I'm talking to you.
[2:18:45] They fail to dis you know to disciple to
[2:18:48] raise up son when when the church lacks
[2:18:52] visionary leadership.
[2:18:56] The the pews become just full of
[2:18:59] desperate souls and pulpits
[2:19:04] empty of real men of visions.
[2:19:07] And the next generation don't know how
[2:19:09] to fight.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; They don't know how to serve.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; They don't know how to lead.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; And this is what Paul said. You have
[2:19:18] 10,000 instructors, but not many
[2:19:20] fathers.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; You see, instructors teach doctrine,
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; but fathers reproduce destiny.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Without fathers, the church becomes an
[2:19:33] orphanage.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Without direction,
[2:19:37] Proverbs 29 said, "Where there is no
[2:19:39] vision, the people perish or they they,
[2:19:42] you know, they cast off restraint." When
[2:19:45] fathers fail, there's no more long-term
[2:19:47] vision, no standard of behavior. There's
[2:19:50] no model of manhood, no fear of
[2:19:53] consequences.
[2:19:55] And you know what the result of it? A
[2:19:57] sodom world,
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; confused masculinity,
[2:20:02] sexual chaos, cultural decay. That's
[2:20:05] right.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; But the good news is
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; God's going to have some real men in
[2:20:11] this day.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; God is still in the business of
[2:20:16] restoring the hearts of the fathers to
[2:20:18] the children of God at raising up
[2:20:21] raising up natural fathers who will take
[2:20:24] back their homes.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about with your fist
[2:20:29] or you being a bully. I'm talking about
[2:20:31] on your knees.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; There's where real strength is. We need
[2:20:37] spiritual fathers who will dis who will
[2:20:40] disciple the next generation. We need
[2:20:43] prophetic voices who will cry out in the
[2:20:46] wilderness and say, "Prepare the way of
[2:20:49] the Lord." Because, friend, we are later
[2:20:52] than this day. We are sooner to the end
[2:20:54] than we've ever been.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; We're closer now than ever.
[2:21:04] Brothers and sisters,
[2:21:07] a true father is heaven's gift
[2:21:12] to the generation.
[2:21:15] He's more than a man. He's a chariot,
[2:21:18] a horseman, a voice, a shield.
[2:21:24] He's a conduit of blessings
[2:21:27] where the power of God can flow. So when
[2:21:30] we lose a father in the faith,
[2:21:34] let's not just merely weep and shed a
[2:21:36] few tears.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Let's remember their faith.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Let's consider their end.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Carry their fire.
[2:21:47] The Bible said, "Mark the perfect man
[2:21:49] and behold the upright, for the end of
[2:21:51] that man is peace."
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Let me
[2:21:59] take a few moments
[2:22:02] and go back to the story of Joash.
[2:22:06] like Elisha.
[2:22:12] Let's compare that just a moment with
[2:22:15] our precious brother Biscll.
[2:22:18] This man
[2:22:20] placed his hands upon the hands of
[2:22:24] younger men,
[2:22:26] sons in the faith,
[2:22:29] steady in their aim,
[2:22:31] strengthening their grip,
[2:22:33] guiding their fire.
[2:22:37] The Bible said that he in he instructed
[2:22:41] Joash to take a bow, put an arrow in the
[2:22:44] bow,
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; put your hand upon the bow. And then
[2:22:48] Elisha put his hands upon the king's
[2:22:52] hands.
[2:22:57] Now in the realm of business and life,
[2:23:00] many stand today right here in this
[2:23:02] church, right here in this congregation,
[2:23:05] right here in this family. Many of you
[2:23:07] are successful men and women,
[2:23:11] but not without knowing where your aim
[2:23:14] was first aligned.
[2:23:17] to his daughters, to his son-in-laws,
[2:23:21] to his grandchildren,
[2:23:24] to those he mentored. You didn't get
[2:23:27] here alone.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; He put his hands over your hands.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; And like Elisha with the king steadying
[2:23:37] your grip, calming your nerves, helping
[2:23:41] you pull back the bolstering of destiny.
[2:23:47] When your vision was uncertain, he gave
[2:23:50] you direction.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; When your hands trembled with
[2:23:54] inexperience,
[2:23:55] his were steady with wisdom.
[2:23:58] When you question your calling or your
[2:24:00] capacity, he reminded you of the target.
[2:24:04] He showed you how to hit
[2:24:07] and to make sure you didn't miss the
[2:24:10] mark. And let's be honest, real honest.
[2:24:15] Now,
[2:24:17] the business acumen,
[2:24:19] the abilities, the work ethics, the
[2:24:23] unshakable confidence, the the the quiet
[2:24:26] discernment that many of you carry
[2:24:28] today. It was imparted by him.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't just give you advice. He gave
[2:24:36] you himself. That's right. Amen.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; You are the businessmen, the leaders,
[2:24:42] the entrepreneurs, the visionaries you
[2:24:45] are today
[2:24:47] because he didn't just believe in you.
[2:24:50] He invested in you.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; And and you see that's legacy. That's
[2:24:56] fatherhood. That's the strength of the
[2:24:58] of a chariot and leadership of a
[2:25:00] horseman. And now you must not just
[2:25:03] carry his teachings, but you must carry
[2:25:06] his fingerprints on every arrow that you
[2:25:10] launch.
[2:25:12] And to you children of God today here
[2:25:15] assembled and around the world, I tell
[2:25:18] you, he showed us how to aim the arrow
[2:25:21] of the word straight.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Straight and true
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; toward deliverance, toward healing,
[2:25:28] toward restoration, toward victory. Yes,
[2:25:30] Lord.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; And he stood behind us when we doubted.
[2:25:33] And he stared at us when we when we
[2:25:35] trembled. And and he told us, "Shoot.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Don't be complacent.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Don't be idle.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Put an arrow in your bow and drive back
[2:25:46] and shoot it."
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; He taught us to believe in the power of
[2:25:52] the revealed word and a faithful God.
[2:25:55] That's the things he passed on to you.
[2:25:58] Amen.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; He stood behind us when we wasn't sure
[2:26:03] we could do it.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; When our hands trembled, when our
[2:26:07] confidence faltered, he was there. His
[2:26:11] faith stronger than our fear.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; And he didn't take the bow from our
[2:26:18] hands.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; He placed his hands over ours.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't aim for us. He aimed with us.
[2:26:27] And when we hesitated, when we
[2:26:28] questioned if the arrow would fly or
[2:26:31] even if we were even worthy to hold the
[2:26:33] bow, he would just simply say, "Shoot."
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; And that one word carried power, not
[2:26:40] because of its volume, but because of
[2:26:42] the authority.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; He believed in the arrow because it was
[2:26:46] the word.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; And he believed in the spirit that gave
[2:26:50] it flight. And he believed in us because
[2:26:53] he knew the one who had called us.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; And he taught us not to trust in our own
[2:26:58] ability, but in the power of the
[2:27:01] revealed word and the faithful of a
[2:27:03] covenant keeping God.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; And he taught us that when the word is
[2:27:08] revealed, it must be released,
[2:27:12] not held back, huh, not analyzed to
[2:27:15] death,
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; but loosed into the battlefield with
[2:27:19] prophetic purpose. He taught us that
[2:27:21] arrows wasn't made for quivers.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; They were made to fly.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; And he's showed us how to fly them
[2:27:29] straight.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We didn't just walk away with some
[2:27:32] instruction. We walked away with an
[2:27:35] impartation.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; His steady hand still rest on us. His
[2:27:43] voice still echoes in our spirit.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now we have to aim
[2:27:50] boldly.
[2:27:51] We must stand firmly.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; And with all faith shoot again
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; because he showed us how
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; everywhere he went.
[2:28:06] He put arrows in the hands of believers.
[2:28:10] libraries of of books, tapes, the
[2:28:13] message hub to go into every language,
[2:28:16] millions of dollars poured into
[2:28:19] missions. He preached it in the jungles.
[2:28:22] He risked his life behind the iron
[2:28:25] curtain.
[2:28:26] He was arrested in China
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; for what? For what reason?
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; What was it? What was his criminal act
[2:28:34] of putting arrows of deliverance in the
[2:28:36] hands of God's elect? Amen.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it was. It was the
[2:28:41] arrow of deliverance. The arrow. The
[2:28:43] message is what is needed for the
[2:28:46] rapture. He put it in your hands.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Open the window
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; eastward."
[2:28:58] Huh? Our eyes was ever on the coming of
[2:29:01] the Lord. If we missed that target,
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; we have missed everything.
[2:29:08] And he opened it and Elisha said,
[2:29:09] "Shoot." And he shot. And he said, "The
[2:29:12] arrow of the Lord's deliverance."
[2:29:15] You see, that arrow had a name. It was
[2:29:18] victory deliverance.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; That that arrow had a target. Wasn't
[2:29:24] just shot. It had a target. The enemy
[2:29:28] strongholds.
[2:29:29] That arrow had a source. The revealed
[2:29:32] word of God.
[2:29:36] As I've said, he taught us not to keep
[2:29:38] it in the quiver.
[2:29:40] And he also taught us not to fire
[2:29:42] wildly.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; He taught us to aim with revelation and
[2:29:47] to shoot with faith, knowing that what
[2:29:49] leaves our hands under God's direction
[2:29:52] will hit the mark.
[2:29:54] And we are who we are today
[2:29:58] in business, in ministry, in life
[2:30:02] because he placed his hand over ours.
[2:30:05] And he helped us to release the arrow of
[2:30:08] the Lord's deliverance.
[2:30:10] And he taught us that victory is not
[2:30:13] just a feeling,
[2:30:16] it's a declaration.
[2:30:18] And sometimes all it all it takes is a
[2:30:22] man of faith to stand right behind you
[2:30:24] and say, "Shoot,
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; release it.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; Take the message. Go with it." And
[2:30:30] you'll discover you had deliverance in
[2:30:32] your hand the whole time because this
[2:30:34] message is the arrow of deliverance.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; It'll deliver the sick. It'll deliver
[2:30:40] the lost. It'll deliver the dying. It is
[2:30:44] the arrow of God's deliverance.
[2:30:46] Amen.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; But the story don't end there.
[2:30:53] Elisha told the king, "Take the arrows
[2:30:56] and strike the ground." That was to
[2:30:59] symbolize total defeat of the enemy.
[2:31:07] You know the story.
[2:31:10] He took arrows,
[2:31:14] struck three times,
[2:31:17] and the prophet was angry and he said,
[2:31:21] "Thou should have smitten five or six
[2:31:23] times."
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; Thou you would have smitten Syria until
[2:31:28] thou had consumed it.
[2:31:31] And this man who has gone on before us,
[2:31:33] I want to tell you friends, he didn't
[2:31:36] live a a life of hard half-hearted
[2:31:38] faith. When he struck, he struck hard.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; And he struck often. And he stuck with a
[2:31:44] purpose.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Not for partial victory,
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; but for total triumph.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; And now the bow is in our hands. And and
[2:31:53] the arrows of deliverance are now ours
[2:31:56] is in our possession. And we should not
[2:31:59] strike timidly.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; We got to
[2:32:03] we must not be content with just partial
[2:32:08] victories.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; We got to carry this legacy by taking
[2:32:12] this message to its final destination.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; The rapturing of the bride and the final
[2:32:19] defeat of the enemy. Amen.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; His body may rest,
[2:32:26] but I'll tell you, his influence marches
[2:32:28] on
[2:32:30] in the pulpits that he birthed, in the
[2:32:32] churches he established, in the voices
[2:32:35] that he helped steady,
[2:32:38] and in the truth he championed.
[2:32:42] So let it be said of him like it was of
[2:32:45] Elisha.
[2:32:47] He's the real strength of the nation,
[2:32:49] spiritual chariot, a mighty horseman.
[2:32:55] So, let us honor his memory today. And I
[2:32:58] just want to say, leave these thoughts
[2:33:01] with you.
[2:33:03] Let's just not do it with just mere
[2:33:04] tears,
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; but with bold obedience, with the arrows
[2:33:09] in our hands, and and with a fire in our
[2:33:12] heart, let us strike the let us strike
[2:33:14] the ground, saints.
[2:33:16] Strike again and again and again. What
[2:33:19] do you say, Brother Tim? I I struck and
[2:33:21] and I didn't achieve it and I struck
[2:33:23] again and I didn't achieve it. I tell
[2:33:25] you, God's a God of one chances, two
[2:33:27] chances, three chances. Come on, keep on
[2:33:30] striking. You try. I tried to serve the
[2:33:33] Lord once and I failed and I tried to
[2:33:35] serve him and I failed and I tried.
[2:33:37] Strike again. Strike again. Strike again
[2:33:41] till your enemy is defeated.
[2:33:45] You can overcome anything. Drugs,
[2:33:48] alcohol, tobacco, sex, every kind of
[2:33:50] demon there is in the world. You are
[2:33:52] called to be an overcomer in this age.
[2:33:55] You are not leaving out of here a
[2:33:57] defeated church. You are leaving here a
[2:33:59] triumphant church.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; Strike again.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; Until the enemy is no more.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. We struck before and we saw
[2:34:10] revivals.
[2:34:11] We felt the fire. But too often we have
[2:34:15] stopped short.
[2:34:17] We've settled for a season of victory
[2:34:21] when what God wants is total
[2:34:23] deliverance.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; We rejoiced in a man of God and a move
[2:34:28] of God, but we haven't carried it to
[2:34:31] completion.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; We must finish this. Amen.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; We struck the ground three times
[2:34:41] when we should have struck it more.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, "And the man of God
[2:34:47] was wroth with him. Thou should have
[2:34:52] smitten five or six times.
[2:34:55] Then thou would have smitten Syria."
[2:34:59] You see, the tragedy, the real tragedy
[2:35:03] wasn't in starting.
[2:35:06] It was stopping too soon.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; We can't rest.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; We got something to finish.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; We got a battle to win.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; There's a rapture that must be that we
[2:35:22] must carry be carried toward. There is a
[2:35:24] resurrection that is dependent on you.
[2:35:27] You're the last runners in the race.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we must strike again and again
[2:35:33] and again and again until the enemy is
[2:35:36] no more. Until death itself is defeated
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; and the dead in Christ rise.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; We're in that day.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Strike again.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Not just a dent, not just a delay,
[2:35:53] but destruction, completion, finality.
[2:35:57] We're a generation that must break the
[2:36:00] cycle.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham told us again, and
[2:36:05] I could read the whole quote, but you
[2:36:07] know it where the cycle of revival and
[2:36:11] death has never failed.
[2:36:14] Every generation would start with fire
[2:36:16] with passion and after a little while it
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; we get a desire you know to refine the
[2:36:23] message to make it platable for
[2:36:26] everybody
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; and we lose the real vision
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; and the real purpose.
[2:36:35] Every movement has started out that way
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; and they lost it because they wanted to
[2:36:42] refine it,
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; Make it better.
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; You can't make it better.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. I'll tell you what. You
[2:36:52] know, every ever every ever every age
[2:36:54] has went with the cycle of revival and
[2:36:56] death. It has never failed.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; But I say, "Oh, God, don't let that be
[2:37:02] our story, too.
[2:37:04] Let us be one that breaks the cycle.
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; The history will show it. A fire falls,
[2:37:10] a people rises, altars are built,
[2:37:12] churches, and then slowly declines
[2:37:15] creeps in and the passion will fade and
[2:37:18] the purity drifts and the vision dims.
[2:37:21] I'll tell you again, we must break the
[2:37:23] cycle.
[2:37:25] We are not called to repeat past
[2:37:28] awakenings and then let the fire go out
[2:37:31] and sit then upon the ashes of memories
[2:37:34] of the past revival. No sir, we are
[2:37:36] called to finish this.
[2:37:39] We are to call. We are called to strike
[2:37:42] again and again. Not with lukewarmness.
[2:37:44] We are not Leodosans.
[2:37:47] We are the bride, the elect, the chosen,
[2:37:50] the called, the anointed.
[2:37:53] Amen.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; We are called to carry the cho the torch
[2:37:56] forward until this fire leads to a
[2:38:00] rapture, not relapse.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; And no, it's not the time to watch the
[2:38:07] flame. It's the time to become the
[2:38:10] flame,
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; to be the light in this time of
[2:38:13] darkness.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; And there must be men rise. Men with
[2:38:17] passion, with purpose, with vision. Not
[2:38:20] casual men, not men of convenience,
[2:38:24] not comfortable men,
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; but men who burn.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Men who build. Men who break through.
[2:38:32] Men who are not just spectators, but
[2:38:35] soldiers.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Not just consumers, but deliverers. Not
[2:38:39] Not just sons, but fathers raising up
[2:38:42] the next wave of warriors.
[2:38:45] It ain't the time for just symbolic
[2:38:47] swings of the sword and fancy moves and
[2:38:51] whatever. That ain't the time. It's the
[2:38:53] time for decisive strikes of obedience
[2:38:57] until the enemy is shattered,
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; totally shattered and the kingdom of God
[2:39:02] is revealed in power.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; We can talk about this flame and we can
[2:39:10] look at this flame. We can talk about
[2:39:12] how it burned brightly. It's time for
[2:39:14] you to burn.
[2:39:16] It's time for you to be the flame. It's
[2:39:19] time for you to be on fire. It's time
[2:39:21] for you to have a passion and a drive
[2:39:24] within your life. I must finish this. I
[2:39:27] can overcome.
[2:39:29] [Music]
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; I don't care what vices hold you. I
[2:39:32] don't care what sin has beset you. I
[2:39:36] don't care what it is. You can overcome
[2:39:40] because an arrow of deliverance has been
[2:39:42] put in your hands.
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; We have not been called to defeat. We
[2:39:47] have been called to victory.
[2:39:52] &gt;&gt; So I say, let the sons who were trained
[2:39:56] by the fathers now become the fathers to
[2:39:59] the next sons.
[2:40:03] Let the hands of once trembled, now
[2:40:06] strike with boldness.
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; Let the arrows of deliverance be fired
[2:40:10] again until strongholds fall until
[2:40:13] chains break until silence turns to
[2:40:16] song. Let let me tell you again, don't
[2:40:20] stop and don't look back and don't
[2:40:22] strike once and expect to be enough.
[2:40:24] Strike again and again and again and
[2:40:28] again
[2:40:29] [Applause]
[2:40:30] until your enemy is no more.
[2:40:35] [Music]
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; And may this generation
[2:40:42] be the generation
[2:40:45] that finishes what others began.
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; This is a call
[2:40:51] for God called men.
[2:40:55] God's not calling for polished
[2:40:57] professionals.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; He's not calling for platform
[2:41:01] performers.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; He's want real true men of God.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Men with backbone, men with a burden,
[2:41:08] men with boldness, men who are sure of
[2:41:11] their calling, who aren't shaken by the
[2:41:13] trends.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; They're not listening to the applause of
[2:41:18] the world. They're not worried about the
[2:41:21] fear of rejection. that he's calling for
[2:41:23] men to rise up with a holy boldness and
[2:41:27] preach the word.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; My God, if there ever was a time that
[2:41:33] the word needs to be preached is now.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; And I say preach it.
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; Preach it in your life. Let it be your
[2:41:40] testimony on your job, in school,
[2:41:43] wherever you are. Let it be preached.
[2:41:47] Preach it
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; with passion. Preach it because you're
[2:41:51] called. Preach it because God handed you
[2:41:54] an arrow
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; of deliverance.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Preach it.
[2:42:03] Preach heaven high and hell hot with
[2:42:07] fire in your bones and truth in your
[2:42:09] mouth.
[2:42:18] Not men of ego
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; and insecurity.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; Heaven help us.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; We have had enough kingdom builders.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; We don't need more men preaching from
[2:42:34] their complexes.
[2:42:38] Too many are preaching in their pulpit
[2:42:41] from their complexes.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Nursing their wounds,
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; masking their insecurities with pulpits
[2:42:49] and microphones. We don't need that.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; That's what it we do not need that. We
[2:42:54] need men
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; of God, not men obsessed with
[2:42:59] recognition
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; fighting for who sits on the right or
[2:43:03] who sits on the left. You know Jesus
[2:43:06] silenced that spirit among his disciples
[2:43:08] and we must silence that in the ministry
[2:43:11] today.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not about you or me.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; It's not about how great I am. It's how
[2:43:19] great he is.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; It's not getting you in love with me.
[2:43:23] It's getting you in love with him.
[2:43:26] That's what it's about.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; It's not about you, your kingdom, your
[2:43:31] domain. Amen.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; Like John the Baptist, let's be like him
[2:43:36] who when he told he was told they come
[2:43:39] to him, you know, he's provokers. They
[2:43:42] come and said, you know, that man Jesus
[2:43:45] that you baptized,
[2:43:48] you he's gaining more followers than
[2:43:50] you.
[2:43:53] He, you know, he's baptizing even more
[2:43:55] than you.
[2:43:58] And you know, John said these words that
[2:44:02] I wish every preacher could learn.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; A man can receive nothing except it be
[2:44:10] given him from heaven.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; And that's the spirit we need in this
[2:44:19] hour. man who knows that every ounce of
[2:44:22] influence, every drop of anointing,
[2:44:24] every door that has been opened for them
[2:44:26] is a gift from God.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; It is not the prize of ambition.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where there's no jealousy, no
[2:44:35] rivalry. You know, we we need men who
[2:44:38] can rejoice when others succeed.
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need men that that when is it
[2:44:45] said Saul has slain his thousands
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; but David his tens of thousands.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; We need real men who don't flinch at
[2:44:54] another man's victories.
[2:44:57] [Applause]
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; They don't shrink in the shadow of
[2:45:02] another's anointing. They praise God
[2:45:05] that the kingdom is advancing. No matter
[2:45:08] who is the one swinging the sword,
[2:45:14] we're not in competition.
[2:45:17] We are in and under a divine commission.
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; We need men who are settled, who are
[2:45:24] sure in their calling. Men who don't
[2:45:27] need to be the loudest voice,
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; but who carries the clearest message.
[2:45:35] Men who are not building platforms for
[2:45:37] themselves,
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; but altars for God.
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; Men who are comfortable with their own
[2:45:43] identity
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; and sure of their mission and they're
[2:45:46] fearless in their obedience.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; We need fathers,
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; not just preachers. Amen.
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; We need men who will nurture the sons,
[2:45:59] who will raise up others,
[2:46:01] who will multiply themselves in spirit
[2:46:04] and character.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; Men who protect, who stand in the gap,
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; who say not on my watch.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; When the enemy comes for their home or
[2:46:15] comes for their church or comes for the
[2:46:17] truth, they stand in the gap. Not on my
[2:46:20] watch.
[2:46:22] You see, the the world is falling a
[2:46:25] apart because righteous men are silent.
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; Evil advances when good men retreat.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; We need men who will stand. Men who are
[2:46:36] unashshamed of the gospel, who are
[2:46:39] uncompromising in truth, who who are
[2:46:42] unshaken by pressure,
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; men who love righteousness and hate
[2:46:47] evil, men who will cry aloud and spare
[2:46:50] not. Men who will preach, repent.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Why are we preaching repent? Cuz the
[2:46:56] world needs to repent.
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; Man would needs to repent need to turn
[2:47:01] to God for the kingdom of heaven is at
[2:47:04] hand.
[2:47:06] Now, God ain't calling celebrities.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; He's calling servants.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; He's calling fathers.
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; He's calling watchmen.
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; He's calling firebaptized men full of
[2:47:21] the Holy Ghost to carry the burden of
[2:47:24] the word to this last generation.
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; They are the heartbeat of the kingdom.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; So, I say,
[2:47:32] rise up, men of God.
[2:47:35] I say to you preachers here,
[2:47:38] preach like there's no tomorrow.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; Preach as if the rapture is today.
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do everything you can to get
[2:47:48] everyone saved.
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; You on your jobs at work, you say,
[2:47:52] "Well, this person is persecuting me."
[2:47:54] Do what you can do to take them to
[2:47:56] heaven with you.
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; Don't condemn them to hell. Take them to
[2:48:00] heaven with you.
[2:48:02] Amen. Fight like a warrior. Love like a
[2:48:05] father. Stand like a pillar in a
[2:48:07] crumbling world.
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; Don't just strike once, twice,
[2:48:14] half-heartedly.
[2:48:17] Joash
[2:48:19] had a bow.
[2:48:21] He had the arrow of deliverance in his
[2:48:23] hand. He had a prophet by his side. He
[2:48:27] had a window of opportunity.
[2:48:31] But when it came time to strike,
[2:48:35] he tapped.
[2:48:38] Three lazy, halfhearted strikes.
[2:48:44] Elisha was angry, not because he was
[2:48:47] disobedient,
[2:48:49] because he struck,
[2:48:51] but not with passion.
[2:48:55] &gt;&gt; He followed the command, but his heart
[2:48:58] wasn't in it.
[2:49:00] He was lukewarm,
[2:49:02] mechanical,
[2:49:04] going through the motions.
[2:49:07] &gt;&gt; He had access to total victory, but he
[2:49:10] lacked the zeal.
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; His reluctant effort ensured only
[2:49:17] partial success.
[2:49:20] You see,
[2:49:22] he just did enough to say, "I tried."
[2:49:28] but not enough to bring the enemy to his
[2:49:30] knees.
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; He struck, but he didn't strike like a
[2:49:36] man who believed that the the arrow was
[2:49:38] from God. Come on. That's right.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; If he'd have really realized
[2:49:45] these are the arrow of deliverance and
[2:49:48] this is my enemy, buddy, he would have
[2:49:50] given up.
[2:49:53] But you see what be what should have
[2:49:56] been a total deliverance became just a
[2:49:59] temporary delay and the enemy would come
[2:50:01] and he just had partial victories.
[2:50:04] And we're living in a day where too many
[2:50:06] are doing exactly what Joash did.
[2:50:10] They've been handed the arrow of
[2:50:13] deliverance, truth, authority, calling,
[2:50:16] anointing, and they barely move.
[2:50:21] And instead of striking the ground in
[2:50:23] faith, they're sitting on the couch in
[2:50:26] comfort.
[2:50:30] Instead of waring in prayer, they war on
[2:50:34] video games,
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; consoles.
[2:50:38] Instead of building altars, they're
[2:50:40] building profiles.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; We were seeing a generation that has
[2:50:45] lost their way. Those that should have
[2:50:48] been be men are forever babies.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; We're watching a generation of grown
[2:50:55] infants,
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; boys and men's bodies,
[2:51:00] &gt;&gt; lost in a fantasy world.
[2:51:03] &gt;&gt; Disconnected from reality.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; Where are the men?
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You You don't have much time.
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; Where are men? You don't have time to
[2:51:16] waste.
[2:51:17] &gt;&gt; Where are men who will become fathers?
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where are Where are those sons who
[2:51:23] will become fathers? Where are fathers
[2:51:25] then that will become warriors?
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; God's not looking for Joash's.
[2:51:31] He's looking for David's.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; He We don't need a bunch of timid kings
[2:51:37] with polished armors who who flinch at
[2:51:39] the prophet's voice. We need We need men
[2:51:42] like David. Men who don't flinch at the
[2:51:45] battle line. Men who don't ask for
[2:51:48] permission to believe. Men who don't who
[2:51:51] who don't run away from the enemy, but
[2:51:53] they run toward their giants.
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And say, "Who is this
[2:51:58] uncircumcised Philistine
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; that he should defy the armies of the
[2:52:04] living God?"
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; That wasn't arrogance. That was a holy
[2:52:08] defiance. This young man was so filled
[2:52:11] with the faith in a big God.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; A God that was bigger than a Goliath.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; I want to know. I want you to see see
[2:52:19] something right here. You got to see
[2:52:20] your God is a big God.
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; Your problem may be big. It may be
[2:52:25] called a Goliath. It may be a giant, but
[2:52:27] it ain't as big as your God. Your God is
[2:52:30] bigger than any of your problems. It's
[2:52:32] bigger than that situation in your life.
[2:52:35] Come on now. Amen. And if all you got is
[2:52:38] a sling in your hand, you got the name
[2:52:41] of Jesus to throw at it. Let it go.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; We need men like David who can't stomach
[2:52:51] the silence of cowards anymore.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; Men who are not afraid to bleed, to
[2:52:56] lead, to believe again.
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; We need men like Shadrach, Meshach, and
[2:53:00] Abednego
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; who will stand when everyone else is
[2:53:04] bowing. men who would defy the king's
[2:53:07] command rather than compromise on their
[2:53:10] convictions.
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; These men didn't negotiate with the
[2:53:15] flames. They didn't even try to escape
[2:53:17] the flames or the fire. They said, "Our
[2:53:20] God
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; is able to deliver us,
[2:53:24] &gt;&gt; but even if he doesn't,
[2:53:26] &gt;&gt; we will not bow."
[2:53:29] And that is the backbone, the courage,
[2:53:31] the kind of fearless resolve that this
[2:53:34] hour demands of us all.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; Men who will not flinch under pressure,
[2:53:41] but men who will burn before they bow.
[2:53:45] This is the hour for righteous men to
[2:53:48] rise. For the battle lines are drawn,
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; giants are taunting,
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; idols are rising,
[2:53:57] and the furnace is getting hotter, seven
[2:54:00] times hotter, combining the heat of
[2:54:04] every age.
[2:54:06] And even as that fire is burning hotter
[2:54:09] and hotter and hotter, so is the fire in
[2:54:13] our bones.
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got a fire in our bones that is
[2:54:20] hotter than the fire of the furnace. And
[2:54:23] this is the hour for Davids to rise, for
[2:54:25] shamgars to take their their ox go to
[2:54:28] realize that they are called, anointed
[2:54:30] and placed for this rapture hour.
[2:54:33] &gt;&gt; This is the hour for Shadrachs to stand,
[2:54:35] for men of conviction to fear God more
[2:54:38] than they fear culture.
[2:54:42] &gt;&gt; I'm sick of men trying to be liked.
[2:54:44] That's right.
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; We need men that are ready
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; to be lit on fire by the word of God.
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Be a gentleman. Brother
[2:54:52] Biscllow was a gentleman. Be tender with
[2:54:54] your family. Certainly be kind. Be
[2:54:57] humble. Be wise.
[2:54:59] &gt;&gt; But don't be soft in spirit.
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; Don't be weak in your conviction.
[2:55:05] Don't be afraid to raise your voice for
[2:55:07] righteousness,
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; to draw your sword of truth
[2:55:11] &gt;&gt; and to strike the ground
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; until every stronghold is shattered,
[2:55:17] &gt;&gt; totally shattered,
[2:55:19] &gt;&gt; we need men. And I'm talking to you now.
[2:55:22] I'm talking to you young men.
[2:55:24] &gt;&gt; We need men.
[2:55:26] Some of you, some of you boys are 40 and
[2:55:29] 50.
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; I didn't make a mistake.
[2:55:35] We need men
[2:55:38] &gt;&gt; who will put the controller down
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; and pick up the cross.
[2:55:44] [Applause]
[2:55:55] We need men that are turned off the
[2:55:57] screen and turn back to the scripture
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; and hear the message.
[2:56:05] &gt;&gt; We need to leave apathy and step into
[2:56:09] authority.
[2:56:10] &gt;&gt; And I am urging you as a congregation,
[2:56:14] as his family, as his children, as his
[2:56:16] friends, as your fellow ministers
[2:56:20] to strike with all you've got. Amen.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; If brother Misco taught us anything,
[2:56:27] &gt;&gt; it's that half-hearted faith produces
[2:56:30] half deliverance.
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; And now the mantle falls.
[2:56:35] The bow is in our hands. The word has
[2:56:38] been revealed. And the time is now
[2:56:41] &gt;&gt; to strike your enemy
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; again
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; and again
[2:56:47] &gt;&gt; and again
[2:56:48] &gt;&gt; until the enemy is no more. Amen.
[2:56:52] &gt;&gt; If the chariot and the horsemen of
[2:56:54] Israel are gone, then someone must rise.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; So I say
[2:57:02] it's not the job of one man.
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; So it's the job of many. Let fathers
[2:57:11] rise again in the home, in the pulpit,
[2:57:15] &gt;&gt; in the streets,
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; and in the prayer closet.
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when fathers stand,
[2:57:22] nations are protected.
[2:57:24] When fathers lead, generations are
[2:57:27] preserved.
[2:57:28] And when fathers speak, the enemy is
[2:57:32] silenced.
[2:57:34] &gt;&gt; And if the chariot is gone, if the
[2:57:36] horsemen had passed on, then I'm asking,
[2:57:39] who then will step forward?
[2:57:43] Elisha cried these words over Elijah
[2:57:46] when he went up and he caught the mantel
[2:57:49] that failed.
[2:57:51] Joash would repeat these words over
[2:57:53] Elisha,
[2:57:55] but he failed to strike the ground with
[2:57:58] full force.
[2:57:59] So I'm asking you, what will we do?
[2:58:04] Will we break this cycle of revival and
[2:58:07] death? Will this message die with his
[2:58:10] elders?
[2:58:12] Or will there be men of God that are God
[2:58:15] called, Godanointed, bloodwash,
[2:58:18] spiritfilled men
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; who will strike the enemy until we gain
[2:58:23] that high ground of the resurrection.
[2:58:28] &gt;&gt; Let us not repeat Joash's mistake.
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; Let us rise with Elisha's resolve.
[2:58:34] &gt;&gt; Let the mantle of fatherhood, let both
[2:58:37] natural and spiritual, let it fall on
[2:58:39] us. I say to you, pick up your bow.
[2:58:42] Amen.
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take the arrows of deliverance.
[2:58:46] &gt;&gt; It's been on your wall as decorations
[2:58:48] too long.
[2:58:49] &gt;&gt; Strike the ground again and again until
[2:58:51] the enemy is no more.
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; As I close, Psalms 37 says, "Mark the
[2:58:59] perfect man and behold the upright,
[2:59:03] for the end of that man is peace."
[2:59:07] And I say, brother Biscll, his hand was
[2:59:09] not tragedy.
[2:59:12] It was peace.
[2:59:13] &gt;&gt; It was a life well-lived,
[2:59:16] a faith wellkept.
[2:59:20] Oh, as we repeat these words,
[2:59:24] as we think of what it said in
[2:59:27] Revelation, that blessed are they that
[2:59:29] die in the Lord, that they may rest in
[2:59:32] their labors, and their works do follow
[2:59:35] them. Brother Biscll's influence marches
[2:59:40] on. His words walk behind us, walk
[2:59:44] behind him like a procession of light.
[2:59:48] His life has left a path that we can
[2:59:51] follow.
[2:59:53] So I say this, brother Bisll,
[2:59:58] go and rest.
[3:00:01] Go rest for a little while. Brother
[3:00:03] Bisll,
[3:00:05] join the fellowship of the saints.
[3:00:09] those of Paul, Wesley, Luther, Brother
[3:00:13] Brham, and countless of others who have
[3:00:16] longed for this day.
[3:00:20] But I say, Brother Biscll,
[3:00:23] if you can hear me,
[3:00:25] please don't rest too long
[3:00:28] because the trumpet will sound.
[3:00:31] The Lord shall descend
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; and you will rise not in a theophony
[3:00:36] this time but in a glorified body
[3:00:39] reunited with the living saints to
[3:00:42] finish the mystery and fulfill the
[3:00:44] promise.
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; And I conclude with this prayer the last
[3:00:48] prayer of the Bible. Even so come Lord
[3:00:52] Jesus come.
[3:00:56] [Applause]
[3:00:56] [Music]
[3:01:23] Amen.
[3:01:26] Mom, that's the kind of service dad
[3:01:27] want.
[3:01:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe long for some, but I think Brother
[3:01:33] Tim's paying brother Biscoll back.
[3:01:37] We were down in in in Louisiana. It was
[3:01:39] a five-hour meeting.
[3:01:41] Is that right?
[3:01:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:01:45] Now, a lot of you aren't maybe used to
[3:01:47] it, but this is our life.
[3:01:50] One day I struck
[3:01:53] &gt;&gt; and I've never been the same before
[3:01:55] &gt;&gt; and I've been striking and striking and
[3:01:59] striking.
[3:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And those demons try to come back,
[3:02:02] I strike again.
[3:02:04] &gt;&gt; Try to take my children, I strike again.
[3:02:06] Try to get this church, I'd strike
[3:02:08] again. How many's with me? Amen.
[3:02:11] &gt;&gt; This is the kind of service, brother Ed,
[3:02:13] if if God would let you look over the
[3:02:16] portals of heaven. We're rejoicing
[3:02:19] &gt;&gt; because we're not a bunch of wimps,
[3:02:21] brother Fzen. We are men of God that
[3:02:24] have stood the test of time and we shall
[3:02:27] not give up.
[3:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. This truth is still marching on.
[3:02:34] &gt;&gt; We aren't wimps, brother Tim. We'll keep
[3:02:37] striking. Amen.
[3:02:38] &gt;&gt; Who wants to strike today?
[3:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We say, "Well, this is a service."
[3:02:43] Brother Donaldson, God bless you. I was
[3:02:46] just passing the secretary when I heard
[3:02:48] she says, "Andrew Donaldson's coming." I
[3:02:50] said, "You got to be kidding me." I told
[3:02:53] him, "Tell me he's going to preach next
[3:02:54] Sunday.
[3:02:57] He still got on a plane. I This This is
[3:03:00] marvelous." Brother Dioa, his dear son,
[3:03:05] but I've loved so many Israel so many
[3:03:09] years. And God bless you, Brother
[3:03:11] Neville, flying this all the way from
[3:03:14] Washington DC going to get on a plane at
[3:03:16] 4 in the morning to be with us. I think
[3:03:19] you heard the word today.
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; I I think there's something that was
[3:03:22] burning in our hearts. And brother Benny
[3:03:25] Perry, God bless you. God bless you,
[3:03:27] brother Green. God bless all the
[3:03:28] ministers. Why don't you just lift up
[3:03:30] your hands so the people see you here?
[3:03:32] Brother Andrew, God bless you. Amen.
[3:03:41] Well, some call us a little bit
[3:03:43] fanatical. Well, we used to sing this
[3:03:46] whole course while you're standing. And

[3:12:55] Thank you for your coming. Thank you for
[3:12:56] your support, David. Thank you for
[3:12:59] coming all the way, Lesie. It means so
[3:13:01] so much to us all
[3:13:03] to make this something of great tribute
[3:13:09] to a man that I have adored all my life
[3:13:13] and one great day he'll be standing at
[3:13:16] heaven's portal
[3:13:18] and we'll stand together as a family of
[3:13:20] God. What a day that will be when my
[3:13:23] Jesus I shall see. Why don't we just
[3:13:26] rise stand?
[3:13:33] It's a service never to forget. Brother
[3:13:36] Ron, Brother Tim, never to forget.
[3:13:41] A great tribute to a great man of God.
[3:13:49] I know we can all say we've been
[3:13:50] affected some way.
[3:13:54] Heavenly Father,
[3:13:56] so often it is said
[3:14:00] it's our loss but heaven's gain. But
[3:14:04] what a great gain that was that day.
[3:14:07] His mom was sitting there and those four
[3:14:09] little gas. He went into that
[3:14:13] that other dimension. How sweet, how
[3:14:16] lovely it was. And do you see friends
[3:14:19] that have gathered here this morning,
[3:14:22] different ones in different capacities?
[3:14:27] He was a gentleman, a man of God,
[3:14:32] a father of fathers, a husband of
[3:14:35] husbands,
[3:14:36] pastor of pastors,
[3:14:39] a friend of friends.
[3:14:42] And so Lord, as we cherish these words
[3:14:44] that we've heard today and and different
[3:14:48] ones, Lord, maybe a little long, but
[3:14:50] it'll be okay. I know you'll you'll
[3:14:53] speak to every heart.
[3:14:55] And I just pray that you will pour out a
[3:14:58] blessing upon all that have been a part
[3:15:00] of this great day for us. Would you go
[3:15:05] with us and may your presence abide with
[3:15:07] us and may this memory of this great man
[3:15:10] never be lost from us.
[3:15:13] May we all go in peace and grace of our
[3:15:15] Lord Jesus Christ with your blessing
[3:15:18] upon each life. We ask for the glory of
[3:15:22] God in Jesus name. Amen.
[3:15:26] Well, that's what dad wanted. He just
[3:15:29] wanted a service,
[3:15:32] not a memorial, not a just a gathering
[3:15:35] of talk and chatter. Ron, thank you.
[3:15:39] Just just great great
[3:15:44] that you were a part this morning. And
[3:15:45] mom, thank you for sharing, Dad. That's
[3:15:48] so true. women and girls, you've you've
[3:15:51] given us a part of your father that you
[3:15:53] could have had,
[3:15:55] but we have been the beneficiaries
[3:15:59] of a great man of God. So, God be with
[3:16:02] you.
[3:16:04] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
