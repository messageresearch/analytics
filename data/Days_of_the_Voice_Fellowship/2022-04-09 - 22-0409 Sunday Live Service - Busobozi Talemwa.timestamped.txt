[37:33] we all did that we could not pay

[37:39] so great that no man could pay
[37:41] but there is one who came from glory

[37:51] all along from glory
[37:53] to pray your passions

[37:58] and the same jesus who told david

[38:54] when we were born and worse in our
[38:56] denomination
[38:57] the love came down and thrown us out
[39:01] and this morning we are children of god
[39:04] and now we are sons of god
[39:07] [Music]
[39:14] me
[39:15] there was that moment where nothing
[39:17] could help you
[39:19] the world turned you down
[39:21] the family stand you died when you
[39:24] accepted jesus
[39:26] friends stand away from you

[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:06:15] remember when we started to do this
[1:06:19] it was with a few people
[1:06:22] about uh i don't remember the number
[1:06:24] that was in that meeting at my house
[1:06:27] meeting your customers
[1:06:30] but it was about uh probably 10 or 15.
[1:06:36] and we
[1:06:37] we agreed that we would start
[1:06:40] uh
[1:06:41] we would not rent another place
[1:06:50] we agreed instead of paying more money
[1:06:52] out there we can just collect that money
[1:06:54] and we use it to buy our lives
[1:07:26] and
[1:07:27] recently i told you that i'm believing
[1:07:29] the lord that by the end of this year
[1:07:31] this year
[1:07:32] uh 2022.
[1:07:38] believing that at least our first
[1:07:40] service of next year we should have it
[1:07:42] in our language
[1:07:52] what is it impossible with men is
[1:07:54] possible
[1:07:57] even if we get half the money or at
[1:07:59] least some uh fraction i'm sure that
[1:08:01] someone we can find someone willing to
[1:08:03] let us feel the ship in their place
[1:08:05] i'd rather take the land and then begin
[1:08:07] to use it while we clear it
[1:08:13] [Music]

[1:16:45] may be a service where your presence
[1:16:47] will just come and engage someone here
[1:16:52] you're not looking for a great emotional
[1:16:55] experience
[1:16:59] we are looking for a transforming power
[1:17:02] what would like to know your manager you
[1:17:04] just come and engulf our souls
[1:17:07] today

[1:17:14] world that when
[1:17:25] may you give us a good atmosphere
[1:17:27] welcome at 20 million we
[1:17:42] amen
[1:17:52] this morning i'm speaking on part 10 of
[1:17:55] receiving the holy ghost i'm a
[1:18:24] jacob
[1:18:26] amen man i want it to be expected
[1:18:30] yeah
[1:18:31] and
[1:18:32] this morning um we will dwell we read
[1:18:34] this
[1:18:35] john 20 but really i will dwell on luke
[1:18:38] 15.
[1:18:55] my
[1:18:56] subtitle which is really what i'm going
[1:18:57] on today is restore restoring the
[1:18:59] relationships
[1:19:06] and we have looked at many different
[1:19:08] dimensions of this same subject
[1:19:10] of the holy spirit
[1:19:15] we have looked at many dimensions of the
[1:19:18] subject of the holy spirit
[1:19:48] oh
[1:20:17] you have you have heard the word you
[1:20:18] have received the holy ghost
[1:20:24] you see they say that the word of god is
[1:20:26] a full package
[1:20:30] some scriptures like the one where jesus
[1:20:32] says that my word which you have had is
[1:20:35] spirit and his life
[1:20:42] so now they were comforted to believe
[1:20:44] that when you receive and believe the
[1:20:45] word you don't need to seek for the holy
[1:20:48] ghost because you have already received
[1:20:49] the holy ghost
[1:20:56] but they found out that the bible says
[1:20:59] in the book of acts 19.
[1:21:05] did you receive the holy ghost
[1:21:10] so which means you can receive the word
[1:21:22] and we talked about the old testament
[1:22:09] into that one the holy spirit is the
[1:22:11] life of god himself
[1:22:14] the holy spirit is something that
[1:22:16] restores us to the lost relationship
[1:22:19] with god
[1:22:35] it begins by accepting all the words not
[1:22:37] part of the world
[1:22:41] you know and we found
[1:22:43] the importance of revelation
[1:22:47] i saw that the children of israel
[1:22:50] had lambs
[1:23:00] but their egyptians did not have the
[1:23:03] prophet what would have a mystery tabari
[1:23:26] he was not looking for people coming
[1:23:28] from this tribal that drive us from that
[1:23:30] church or from that church
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:25:11] but you see that these people they had
[1:25:13] the flesh
[1:25:15] the whole time
[1:25:17] today was a rejoicing
[1:25:20] because it brings stimulation
[1:25:23] you know let me tell you
[1:25:25] if you want to know someone is happy but
[1:25:27] when you're kind of in trouble
[1:25:28] for truly someone can really be happy
[1:25:32] give them food
[1:25:35] you will never you you look at all the
[1:25:37] pictures taken when people are eating
[1:25:52] amen and in this case
[1:25:54] we are talking about the world talking
[1:25:55] about gambling
[1:26:05] that's why we get so happy and free
[1:26:08] to say no to everybody that's why we get
[1:26:10] excited
[1:26:12] when we hear the word
[1:26:14] must excite you if you're a true child
[1:26:16] of god
[1:26:52] [Laughter]
[1:27:15] it is the word that moves
[1:27:56] because this blood will be a talking
[1:27:58] unto your
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:26] amen what
[1:28:40] hallelujah
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:27] which i think is the outstanding subject
[1:29:29] of today
[1:29:33] what is the holy spirit
[1:29:36] another reason i have taken these three
[1:29:38] uh these subjects in line like this is
[1:29:40] because you cannot come
[1:29:43] and receive the holy ghost
[1:29:45] unless you know what it is
[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:30:18] unless you
[1:30:41] [Music]
[1:30:45] so if you know what
[1:31:14] if you know what it
[1:31:55] remember that we were born in the image
[1:31:57] of god what do you create what's that
[1:31:58] what's funny
[1:32:00] no no no no let me put it this way
[1:32:02] in the image of god twice
[1:32:05] before the fall
[1:32:08] here i'm not talking about supplements
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:34] so now
[1:32:36] man was born in a foreign
[1:33:05] but when man fell from
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:34:25] [Applause]
[1:35:54] only
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:50] you thought if you'll get this money you
[1:36:52] will be satisfied there was a single
[1:36:54] funeral saying to get material and you
[1:36:55] were not they were mature you thought if
[1:36:58] you look at the house what was that what
[1:36:59] if you knew me you would be satisfied
[1:37:01] and you were not
[1:37:03] you thought if you get a girlfriend or a
[1:37:04] boyfriend
[1:37:16] some of you thought if you come to
[1:37:18] church you'll be satisfied
[1:37:46] since i was in secondary school
[1:37:50] and i believe the lord the holy spirit
[1:37:51] is really working on him now at the time
[1:37:55] i would really want you to pray for him
[1:37:58] yeah
[1:38:28] i was wondering
[1:38:42] because
[1:38:52] [Applause]
[1:39:10] jesus is not something you can try yes
[1:39:13] you sit into your presence sir we did
[1:39:15] not come here to try him the truth
[1:39:18] is yes we come here because we are sure
[1:39:22] the rest is
[1:40:20] sufficient remedy for the soul of the
[1:40:23] heart
[1:40:45] and the spiritual sickness quickly
[1:40:47] became a physical
[1:41:16] sickness oh it's wrecked on you a
[1:41:18] sickness of the soul
[1:41:20] and it translated into sicknesses of the
[1:41:23] body
[1:41:25] that's why when he received the holy
[1:41:27] ghost
[1:41:30] over the devil in your body
[1:41:34] we are given the power and authority to
[1:41:35] wherever you know what he is to speak
[1:41:37] life to the things
[1:41:39] to speak healing to the sins
[1:41:43] because if we have received
[1:41:44] transformation
[1:41:59] never through our life we can speak
[1:42:00] healing
[1:42:03] i believe for healing
[1:42:08] because divine healing
[1:42:12] that there is something
[1:42:41] is the full
[1:42:42] full restoration
[1:42:45] of the souls
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] the fully restored relations
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:36] all the preliminaries
[1:43:49] is all leading up to this this is
[1:43:52] you know
[1:43:53] you see he's preparing us to take a
[1:43:56] taker all the justification we receive
[1:44:00] sanctification
[1:44:02] it is leading up to this little prayer
[1:44:05] and it is unfortunate that many people
[1:44:08] don't reach this level of receiving the
[1:44:11] holocaust
[1:44:17] um
[1:44:22] it is sad
[1:44:28] i slept past three a.m last night never
[1:44:32] was
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:45:00] how much willingness
[1:45:28] that today will be your day
[1:45:31] of receiving the true full
[1:45:34] restoration
[1:45:39] of your relationship with jesus
[1:45:44] i wanted to look at these scriptures in
[1:45:46] luke 15 brother give it to me on the
[1:45:47] screen luke 15 11.
[1:45:52] and he said a certain man had two sons
[1:45:56] at the arena
[1:46:00] father
[1:46:01] give me the portion of goods that falls
[1:46:03] to me
[1:46:05] i went in
[1:46:06] to
[1:46:07] one day
[1:46:09] and he divided unto them he's living
[1:46:14] and not many days after the youngest son
[1:46:17] gathered all
[1:46:19] together
[1:46:22] um
[1:46:38] there wasted his substance with rayotas
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:52] he wasted his inheritance over chicago
[1:46:56] he put the name of his father to shame
[1:47:00] yes
[1:47:02] he never was bothered
[1:47:06] because he saw the recent church
[1:47:09] he had new priorities
[1:47:15] his dream was different
[1:47:20] his desire was different
[1:47:25] his purpose was different
[1:47:30] from that of his father
[1:47:34] but yet
[1:47:44] his father never wanted him to be a
[1:47:46] religious man
[1:48:56] you may ask me who is this
[1:49:24] when we have already rejected our true
[1:49:27] nature
[1:49:31] but he had our father in heaven
[1:49:34] always long for true and full

[1:51:29] with the husks of that twine
[1:51:32] that the swine did eat and no man gave
[1:51:34] unto him
[1:51:43] and when he came to himself

[1:51:49] fathers have bred enough and despair and
[1:51:52] i perish with hunger
[1:51:55] supply
[1:52:11] and i will say unto him father i have
[1:52:13] sinned against heaven and before
[1:52:29] he arose and came to his father but when
[1:52:33] he was yet a great way of
[1:52:36] his father saw him and i had compassion
