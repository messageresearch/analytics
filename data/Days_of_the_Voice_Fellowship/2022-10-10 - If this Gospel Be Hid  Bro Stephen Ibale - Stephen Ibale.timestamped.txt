[0:03] oh Jesus is keeping me alive
[0:07] [Applause]
[0:09] [Music]
[0:20] [Applause]
[0:25] amen God
[0:30] praise the name of the Lord
[0:36] hey man I just want to greet you only
[0:38] the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[0:43] today we are privileged
[0:45] to have visitors visiting us today
[0:49] we are privileged to have the Lord
[0:52] coming our way
[0:55] amen Amina
[0:58] uh
[1:00] Pastor Stephen
[1:03] um
[1:05] one of the Elders of the message in our
[1:08] country
[1:11] he will tell us but I think his ministry
[1:14] could span over for about 40 yards
[1:18] [Music]
[1:21] and so there are many other preachers
[1:24] that you know have come up over the
[1:26] years and uh joined the throng of those
[1:29] who have started and you know and the
[1:31] message has been preached
[1:38] so I always say there are those the
[1:40] first generation preachers of the
[1:42] message the second generation the fact I
[1:44] don't know which generation I am maybe
[1:45] the seventh I don't know
[1:53] but in Uganda
[1:56] Uganda Pastor Stephen is in the first
[1:58] generation
[2:02] uh he's here with his wife sister Sarah
[2:05] yeah
[2:07] and uh they have had also a marriage of
[2:09] many years they will tell us
[2:11] [Music]
[2:13] my wife and I uh always uh
[2:18] I don't I don't know the right word to
[2:20] use but uh
[2:22] I should say we always convey to have
[2:24] such a marriage that has been time
[2:26] tested
[2:34] and we appreciate you brother Steven and
[2:37] Sister Sarah
[2:40] for being an example to very many in our
[2:44] generation and
[2:49] um so I have had an opportunity to work
[2:54] closely with brother Stephen for a few
[2:56] years
[3:00] he invited me to minister also in his
[3:03] church a few years ago before I even
[3:05] became a pastor yeah
[3:11] before we even traveled to Ethiopia
[3:15] and I was very small body
[3:21] but he trusted me with his poop
[3:25] I hope I did not cause any damage
[3:29] but I want to say God bless you for that
[3:31] opportunity
[3:34] and uh so today you know when I invited
[3:37] him to come
[3:39] he was very gracious and he accepted the
[3:42] invitations
[3:53] um
[3:56] our charge is just well about uh a year
[3:59] and a half can you say your face
[4:03] although we have a few that have come
[4:05] from other churches and so we have a few
[4:07] here who have also been in the message
[4:08] for quite some time
[4:14] and uh I know our students are all not
[4:18] here
[4:21] there are also some would stream with us
[4:25] and since we usually archive our
[4:28] services I believe that there will be
[4:30] many more who will hear the service
[4:32] today
[4:39] we are requesting you Pastor Steven to
[4:42] preach to us
[4:49] there is I believe much more in you
[4:52] [Music]
[4:54] that we here in this Fellowship
[4:56] [Music]
[4:58] is that right and
[5:03] um just have a hundred percent Liberty
[5:08] you are our father
[5:10] you know it's always a good uh to know
[5:13] you know our support say that you do not
[5:15] have many fathers
[5:18] those who went and established the
[5:21] message when I I've been I've had that
[5:23] opportunity in Ethiopia when there is
[5:25] completely no message
[5:34] it is very hard to start from nothing
[5:40] and so you should always respect affect
[5:43] Those Who start who do the rudimentary
[5:45] work the same way
[5:49] there is always much in them that we can
[5:52] learn
[5:55] by Ministry Pastor Stephen is a teacher
[6:01] and so I believe we have a lot to learn
[6:04] today
[6:06] I would like you to also give a hundred
[6:09] percent attention
[6:12] we have one service so we want to give
[6:15] him as much time as he needs service
[6:20] we are not in a hurry
[6:27] [Music]
[6:33] and so then I would know that you are
[6:36] doing that by saying Amen to everyone
[6:41] amen so without uh father you would like
[6:44] us to stand and then we sing A Chorus as
[6:47] we invite him
[6:52] Ethiopia
[7:05] and uh since I would not like uh the
[7:08] pastor's time to be taken when he comes
[7:10] I don't know he says no but come and
[7:13] greet us just one minute let us hear
[7:14] yourself
[7:16] I traveled with him even to take right
[7:18] where there is a war now and uh
[7:23] and uh he was a good brother
[7:27] for one year or two foreign
[7:36] supposedly
[7:47] it's not easy or is to start from
[7:50] nothing
[7:53] it takes a man with the courage
[8:05] so I know you are all in good hands
[8:10] I've worked with him I know him
[8:14] I've worked with him
[8:16] God bless you so much
[8:22] so um we started in our house which is
[8:25] just right here
[8:29] at about three five people my family
[8:32] [Music]
[8:33] from there we rented another place out
[8:37] there but rather Monument
[8:40] so it became full the Lord now gave us
[8:44] this place
[8:46] so we want to say uh Pastor Steven thank
[8:49] you for coming to support us
[8:54] let us stand and sing in moments like
[8:56] this I sing out a song
[9:06] [Music]
[9:12] I sing out a song
[9:18] I sing out a love song to Jesus
[9:25] [Music]
[9:27] in
[9:29] moments like this
[9:33] I sing God I got a song
[9:39] I sing God I love
[9:43] songs

[9:58] [Music]
[9:59] singing eyes
[10:03] [Music]
[10:30] foreign
[10:34] [Music]
[10:47] [Music]
[11:08] [Music]
[11:14] [Music]
[11:42] but as long as we are in this Divine
[11:44] crisis
[11:47] that you are going to guide them
[11:50] you are going to guide the game
[11:53] father that we may touch
[12:00] heavenly father I want you to disarm our
[12:04] minds
[12:06] that we may not understand by our mind I
[12:09] wondered
[12:10] that we may understand by the heart
[12:15] father dear Lord God
[12:21] dwelling upon the past
[12:24] the blessing upon his family
[12:31] all the entire ministers

[13:27] you see when he was speaking
[13:31] he spoke about being the seventh uh I
[13:34] mean the seventh generation of
[13:36] Ministries
[13:43] and when he speaks about the Seventh
[13:46] Generation
[13:48] then I remember the words
[14:26] [Music]
[14:35] I feel like
[15:15] [Music]
[15:37] foreign foreign
[15:39] [Music]
[15:46] you know I'm very impressed
[15:50] when you're coming down here
[15:53] I find that the preachers uh
[15:57] uh you know position
[16:01] when the preacher's position on the
[16:04] stage is on the left
[16:09] that's what I do at home
[16:13] you see when those angels came
[16:16] there was that main Angel
[16:20] he was standing at a position
[16:25] was at his right side
[16:31] so you know I feel like nobody should
[16:35] stand between me and the angels
[16:41] praise the Lord I want to stand at his
[16:44] right hand
[16:47] right hand over Authority
[16:49] is
[16:52] disorganized places
[16:55] because I don't feel comfortable with
[16:58] the other side
[17:00] [Music]
[17:08] is the brightest side
[17:11] isn't that right
[17:15] yes it's the bright side so I love it
[17:20] amen

[18:19] levered for the Saints

[18:26] across the world
[18:29] everybody
[18:35] I've also traveled with William in Tampa
[18:38] dinette William William is one of my
[18:42] four Sons William
[18:45] when you get good girls
[18:47] [Music]
[18:49] the good boys so
[18:55] that's brother Williams
[18:58] is a very great blessing to us
[19:02] amen I mean he's in the medical field
[19:08] [Music]
[19:09] amen so his uh an instructor in the
[19:14] Medical Institution uh
[19:19] amen me that is a blessing to our family
[19:24] so before we get on here
[19:27] we want to once again appreciate
[19:31] Brothers
[19:35] for giving us the opportunity
[19:39] when I listen to him when moon is a
[19:44] um
[19:45] there's almost nothing
[19:47] that you people would need more than him
[19:50] they were more it is
[20:00] I promise I'm not going to say anything
[20:03] is
[20:07] the ability to say or what he has
[20:10] already said
[20:16] so I'm just coming to share with him in
[20:19] the final year
[20:22] and I pray the Lord blesses us amen
[20:38] [Music]
[20:42] here I says
[20:44] but have renounced the hidden things of
[20:48] dishonest
[20:50] not walking in a craftiness nor handling
[20:53] the word of God deceitfully but by
[20:57] manifestation of the truth commanding
[21:00] ourselves to Every Man's conscience in
[21:03] the sight of God is
[21:22] [Music]
[21:27] my God a blessing the reading of this
[21:30] world
[21:35] now this verse
[21:39] us to renounce the kind of things
[21:43] twiggan
[21:46] that we may be involved
[21:49] we can even
[21:53] without the world not
[21:56] um
[22:01] things of dishonest
[22:05] [Music]
[22:12] let's go to verse 3 here
[22:19] it is heed to them that are lost
[22:32] in whom the God of this world has
[22:36] blinded the minds of them which believe
[22:40] not
[22:41] lest the light of the Glorious gospel of
[22:44] Christ who is the image of God should
[22:49] shine unto
[22:51] themes
[23:06] so when we denounce the hidden fee
[23:09] between
[23:12] there is a light that glows out to the
[23:16] world
[23:19] because your Christ's life
[23:24] is the light to the world
[23:31] so verse 5 here
[23:34] for we preach not ourselves
[23:43] we are not the film of the Gospel
[23:49] We Don't Preach ourselves into your
[23:53] souls
[23:57] we preach not ourselves
[24:03] that Pastor Steve is greater than
[24:07] brother so and so much
[24:12] all I can preach better
[24:17] all I've got a better congregation
[24:22] We Don't Preach ourselves
[24:29] but Christ Jesus the Lord when will that
[24:33] Christian yes and ourselves your
[24:37] servants for Jesus sakes
[24:43] for God you commanded the light to shine
[24:46] out of Darkness foreign
[25:12] [Music]
[25:30] [Music]
[25:42] [Music]
[26:08] but we have this light
[26:12] vessels
[26:15] that the Excellency
[26:17] of the power may be of God and not of us
[26:34] amen did you hear that
[26:37] sometimes you may not know what you have
[26:42] but the light that brought life in the
[26:45] darkest small world
[26:51] now Paul says that has taken a failure
[26:56] of men that have been Justified amen
[27:17] through you your sauce
[27:20] so The Treasure of this slide
[27:28] you do not know who you are
[27:31] but if you know who the words
[27:36] hallelujah amen you can bring life
[27:39] around this singing
[27:43] in Genesis is
[28:15] [Music]
[28:44] [Music]
[28:57] [Music]
[29:04] is not speaking about the spoken word
[29:07] books
[29:10] he's not talking about types and bibles
[29:15] for is speaking about to return the
[29:18] pieces
[29:23] Hallelujah Amina praise the Lord not
[29:27] talking about your Bible
[29:29] it's not talking about the fates you
[29:32] listen
[29:33] he's talking about you uh you'll get a
[29:37] quick way in that gospel
[29:42] if this gospel
[29:46] God give me Grace
[29:50] [Music]
[30:04] each time the gospel is
[30:09] we should always go back Hallelujah
[30:14] [Music]
[30:48] [Music]
[32:30] he was no not the creation
[32:35] you are the one who speaks so sad life
[32:39] was a being
[32:44] hey
[32:48] praise God he was not visible
[32:53] even to the spirit
[32:56] he did not resource capacitor black
[32:59] sisters
[33:12] [Music]
[33:24] because there was nobody seeking to know
[33:27] him
[33:30] I imagine he was self-existence
[33:45] and literally Locust means the spirit
[33:51] Logo Street against
[33:58] amen I mean are you together with me
[34:01] so in other words he took what will
[34:05] refer to as the world body
[34:10] is
[34:20] because he's condescending
[34:24] is coming from that Spirit invisibility
[34:31] to a spirit visibility
[34:35] and the spirit visibility
[34:38] was what we call the world that is
[34:55] [Music]
[35:27] he used to live in the same Dimension
[35:30] with God
[35:32] because he did not have a body of Flesh
[35:43] the spirit of inspiration
[35:47] with the Holy Spirit leads to deliver
[35:49] today
[35:52] and you're together with me
[35:55] yes sir I mean but when it came to town
[36:07] hallelujah amen then God said I'm going
[36:12] to make this man here
[36:19] bring him into dimension of Flesh
[36:26] praise God so now man come down
[36:33] from the Angels
[36:38] amen and God was in that Supreme
[36:42] dimensions
[36:51] [Applause]
[37:10] he falls
[37:12] nagua
[37:16] where it fell come on
[37:18] God now came from the Supreme Dimensions
[37:24] to come into the physical dimensions
[37:28] [Music]
[37:37] foreign
[37:43] [Music]
[38:05] when he becomes in flesh
[38:08] he became a brother yeah
[38:14] [Music]
[38:16] when Paul is speaking about him
[38:20] he's saying that he had become lower
[38:27] so now how can we see the pathways
[38:41] praise God
[38:44] and become like one of us
[38:51] well it's so good man
[38:53] brother Branham says
[38:57] but notes now
[38:59] there is nothing
[39:01] there's nothing okay what is
[39:05] Justice
[39:09] there is no light okay where did you
[39:12] tangle there is no duck is that there's
[39:16] no nothing
[39:17] it just seems
[39:24] is a great Supernatural
[39:28] beasts
[39:37] of all places
[39:42] he was from Everlasting
[39:46] amen he is
[39:54] [Music]
[40:01] [Music]
[40:21] Hallelujah when we get to paragraph 28.
[40:26] he said the next thing we begin to see
[40:33] eyes of Supernatural looking
[40:37] we see a little white light forming out
[40:41] there
[40:48] that was caught by Viper readers
[40:54] [Music]
[40:57] I was going to say
[41:03] to devop into something yeah
[41:07] so human beings
[41:17] [Music]
[41:21] foreign
[41:31] [Music]
[42:19] [Music]
[42:23] not to defeat yeah
[42:27] the feet
[42:30] it was not given to the mouse
[42:34] so that the gospel I wondering may be
[42:38] your work
[42:45] Engineers
[42:53] is the best gospel you can ever pray
[42:59] amen he says that was the word of God
[43:05] listen to what it says
[43:08] now God tell him
[43:13] to this song
[43:17] which was before there was even no atom
[43:21] oh yeah yeah
[43:28] glorify me further
[43:31] with the glory that we had before the
[43:34] foundation of the world
[43:38] hallelujah hallelujah
[43:43] foreign
[43:51] was just a different manifestation
[44:04] see the sun Oman is the condescending of
[44:09] Elohim
[44:11] yes
[44:17] and when God formed himself into what
[44:20] the body
[44:23] we finally got into the womb of the
[44:27] Virgin Islands
[44:30] and the son was born Hallelujah
[44:38] [Music]
[44:45] [Music]
[44:50] [Music]
[45:01] I'm the world
[45:06] the same was in the beginning with God
[45:11] now listen all things were made by him
[45:17] and without him was not anything made
[45:21] that was made
[45:27] he condescended into the sonship yes
[45:40] so in Colossians 1 16
[45:46] we shall go through quite a number of
[45:48] scriptures
[45:53] to make this plant here
[45:57] I believe in quotes
[46:14] Colossians 1 16.
[46:20] when all things created
[46:26] in heaven
[46:31] I sensed something wrong there
[46:34] for by him when all things created bye
[46:43] foreign
[46:54] you understand what I mean
[47:00] we all things created
[47:09] I'm a believer of the Kingdom's Bible
[47:16] [Music]

[50:53] which was in the beginning
[50:57] in the beginning was the word
[51:02] which was from the beginning
[51:06] which we have heard
[51:09] which we have seen with our eyes

[55:05] it is
[55:09] [Music]
[55:32] is the expression of his life away
[55:40] praise the Lord
[55:43] I was speaking in one of my meetings out
[55:47] there
[55:50] and I was speaking about the Sun
[55:54] you see many times when the sun is
[55:57] mentioned
[56:03] it
[56:05] you just go to the understanding of the
[56:09] natural path foreign
[56:43] he says you're not here father
[56:46] sir absolutely
[56:54] that kind of understanding it up with
[56:58] you
[56:59] but yay
[57:04] in scripture
[57:06] is when the Holy Spirit
[57:11] take English
[57:17] then that is
[57:23] when the Holy Spirit come down
[57:28] on the Jordan River
[57:31] for the first time
[57:34] Jesus yes who was introduced as the son
[57:37] yeah
[57:44] praise the Lord
[57:53] praise God that's what the sun is
[57:58] Jesus was not son yes
[58:03] because he was born of a woman
[58:08] so in that particular aspect
[58:12] what would make me a song
[58:19] you see where I'm coming foreign
[58:33] [Music]
[59:06] received him

[1:00:52] that's what makes you a son
[1:01:00] are you here sons of God
[1:01:03] Amen Amina yes sir we wow so we are not
[1:01:08] dealing with men
[1:01:09] we are not dealing with the man he took
[1:01:13] it up and we are dealing with the spirit
[1:01:16] of Life himself
[1:01:26] don't lose that
[1:01:28] Concepts foreign
[1:02:33] what is calling the gospel
[1:02:40] the words we speak
[1:02:44] while we
[1:02:47] preached up by the life
