[1:15:25] So we are so thankful for to God for
[1:15:27] brother Emma and his
[1:15:30] wife whenever the fellowship we went to
[1:15:33] um in I think about
[1:15:36] twice they're newly married about twice
[1:15:40] they have invited us to their
[1:15:42] home and sister cooked very delicious
[1:15:44] meals for
[1:15:46] us. I I I really appre she's a pastor's
[1:15:51] daughter but then married to a minister.
[1:15:56] So let us welcome brother Emma and his
[1:16:03] wife. Well God bless you brother
[1:16:05] Emanuel. Thank you so much and we
[1:16:08] certainly appreciate
[1:16:10] you and um we know that the saints in
[1:16:13] will be blessed by his ministry.
[1:16:19] He ministers
[1:16:20] there. Brother Shem ministers
[1:16:23] there. Brother Julius ministers
[1:16:26] there. And I don't know who else. But
[1:16:28] these brothers are really doing a good
[1:16:31] work. As you know, is just coming
[1:16:35] up. There is much more work to do for
[1:16:38] the
[1:16:39] Lord. And we're just looking forward for
[1:16:41] him to use
[1:16:44] us. Amen. Amen. So the footsteps of the
[1:16:47] righteous are ordered of the
[1:16:50] Lord. I I I believe that all of you are
[1:16:53] here. You are not here by
[1:16:56] accident. Even me, I'm not here by
[1:16:58] accident. It is God's
[1:17:01] leadership. And so, brother Emma, God is
[1:17:03] leading
[1:17:07] you. And uh we just look forward to what
[1:17:10] he has in
[1:17:12] store. also brother um I'm forgetting
[1:17:16] the name now from
[1:17:18] cases God bless you so
[1:17:21] much thank you for coming to fellowship
[1:17:23] with
[1:17:25] us shall we open in the book of Malachi
[1:17:28] 4
[1:17:32] 5 I'm not enjoying my sound
[1:17:36] brothers Malachi
[1:17:40] 4 this is a typical scripture
[1:17:45] Most of us have read
[1:17:48] it. How many know the
[1:17:51] scripture? How many can quote it without
[1:17:54] reading
[1:17:55] it? Malachi
[1:17:59] 4:5-6. Can we read it without reading
[1:18:01] it?
[1:18:10] Behold, brother Marvin has spoiled it.
[1:18:14] I wanted to see those who can read it
[1:18:16] without
[1:18:18] reading. Let's read it anyhow. Behold,
[1:18:21] I'll send you Elijah the prophet before
[1:18:24] the coming of the great and the dreadful
[1:18:27] day of the Lord. and he shall turn the
[1:18:29] heart of the fathers to the children and
[1:18:32] the heart of the children to their
[1:18:33] fathers, lest I come and smite the earth
[1:18:36] with a curse. So in other words, he
[1:18:39] would curse the world.
[1:18:43] He would cast the
[1:18:45] earth if the Elijah's ministry does not
[1:18:48] come
[1:18:50] on. Is that a proper interpretation?
[1:18:54] If Elijah doesn't
[1:18:56] come, the earth will be
[1:19:00] cut.
[1:19:01] Meaning the coming of
[1:19:04] Elijah will bring a
[1:19:07] message which will stare the
[1:19:11] curse. So I'm preaching on the message
[1:19:14] will stay the
[1:19:20] cast. Amen.
[1:19:22] The message stayed the
[1:19:27] curse. You may be
[1:19:40] seated. Amen.
[1:19:49] The message stayed the
[1:19:54] curse. Uh tell your neighbor the message
[1:19:57] stayed the
[1:20:03] curse. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:07] Um we have limited
[1:20:09] time because we have a full day.
[1:20:13] uh we have a ministers meeting
[1:20:16] afterwards after that we shall be having
[1:20:18] the service in
[1:20:21] in so um we just go into the word right
[1:20:26] away how many are ready for the
[1:20:29] word ask your neighbor you ready for the
[1:20:34] word well those of you visiting us the
[1:20:38] first
[1:20:39] time this is days of the voice
[1:20:41] fellowship days of the voice fellowship.
[1:20:44] My name is
[1:20:46] Pastor. Yeah, we have no law but
[1:20:50] love, no membership but
[1:20:53] fellowship. And um you know that's what
[1:20:56] differentiates us from all the
[1:20:58] denominations. We are here to have
[1:21:01] fellowship. We welcome every
[1:21:05] denomination. We welcome anybody and
[1:21:09] everybody. And uh whenever you come
[1:21:11] here, just feel at
[1:21:14] home. Let the Holy Spirit speak to
[1:21:17] you and relax yourself in his
[1:21:21] presence. And uh let us see what he has
[1:21:23] for
[1:21:24] us. S Rose, nice to see you. Not I've
[1:21:27] not seen you for the past three, four
[1:21:32] weeks. Amen. It's always it's always
[1:21:35] good to um see one another in the house
[1:21:37] of the Lord.
[1:21:41] You are not
[1:21:44] responding.
[1:21:46] Amen. Well, well, behold, I'll send you
[1:21:48] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:21:50] the great and dreadful day
[1:21:55] of my head is going in circles because
[1:21:57] there are many ways I can approach
[1:22:02] this. But I just certainly want to
[1:22:04] follow what the Holy Spirit um will tell
[1:22:07] us this morning.
[1:22:11] Amen. Amen. The Elijah
[1:22:15] ministry is promised to
[1:22:17] come before the coming of the
[1:22:21] Lord. How many believe
[1:22:23] that? Is it in the
[1:22:25] Bible? Do we believe
[1:22:27] it? Do you believe
[1:22:30] it? It's a promise. It was promised to
[1:22:34] come before the Lord comes.
[1:22:38] I want us to understand that the Elijah
[1:22:40] ministry is very
[1:22:43] important because of the message Elijah
[1:22:49] carries. It is so it is so
[1:22:52] essential because the world would
[1:22:54] certainly be under a
[1:22:58] curse because you see Elijah ministry
[1:23:01] comes to restore
[1:23:04] back to to restore the world
[1:23:08] back to
[1:23:11] God to restore the world back to
[1:23:15] Jesus as
[1:23:17] savior and it's only that salvation.
[1:23:20] It's only that savior. It's only that
[1:23:23] blood that can stay the
[1:23:28] curse. The world is
[1:23:30] cast. And this morning, I'm going to
[1:23:33] speak on very uh very important
[1:23:36] things. I I pray that you give me your
[1:23:39] hand. Divide
[1:23:41] that. If you can stay in without moving
[1:23:43] back and forth, I'll really
[1:23:47] appreciate. Amen. and try to be
[1:23:49] stationary as much as
[1:23:51] possible. Praise the
[1:23:53] Lord. Praise the
[1:23:57] Lord. We are talking about today is not
[1:24:00] I wouldn't want to call so much of a
[1:24:02] preaching on Sundays. I noticed there
[1:24:04] are many people who don't want to
[1:24:05] fellowship on
[1:24:10] weekdays and they are here on Sunday.
[1:24:14] Well, of course, some are
[1:24:15] visitors, but also many are church
[1:24:18] members who are too
[1:24:22] busy. And so, I noticed when you come on
[1:24:25] Sunday morning, I shouldn't just give
[1:24:27] you a little
[1:24:31] sweet. I should give you real
[1:24:34] food, real boro and
[1:24:37] beans that then will help you to grow.
[1:24:41] So usually on Sunday I need you to be
[1:24:46] very and I hope that some some of you
[1:24:49] brethren can stop uh being Sunday
[1:24:58] mail you know there's a paper I think in
[1:25:00] the UK or whatever it is called Sunday
[1:25:05] mail they only print it on
[1:25:08] Sunday so it is read and bought on
[1:25:13] Some Christians are Sunday
[1:25:18] mail. You will never see them in
[1:25:20] church but only on
[1:25:23] Sunday. But may you never be Sunday
[1:25:27] men. May you be ready every
[1:25:30] day. The Bible says we are written a
[1:25:33] piece red of all
[1:25:36] men. So we should do always attend
[1:25:39] church.
[1:25:41] So on Sunday when I have all of
[1:25:44] you, I want to soil myself in the
[1:25:49] word. How many are ready for that? So
[1:25:53] prepare your mind to take in much. That
[1:25:57] doesn't mean I'll be so
[1:25:59] long. But just stay your mind together
[1:26:02] with
[1:26:04] me. So it is essential. The Elijah
[1:26:06] ministry is very important.
[1:26:10] When I first came into the
[1:26:12] message, I used to ask myself
[1:26:14] question like why do the preachers
[1:26:17] always say brother Bam
[1:26:20] say why do they always quote brother
[1:26:25] Brham who is this brother
[1:26:27] Brham and later on I learned he was a
[1:26:30] man who would fulfill that prophecy of
[1:26:32] the coming of
[1:26:36] the so then I said so
[1:26:39] But because we have
[1:26:41] Jesus, we have the Bible, we have the
[1:26:44] Holy Spirit. So why should we really be
[1:26:46] so much concerned about the Elijah
[1:26:50] ministry? Anyone here with such
[1:26:53] questions? Well, don't lift up your hand
[1:26:56] because some may mark
[1:26:58] you. I can tell you it is good to be
[1:27:02] honest. It is good to ask when you want
[1:27:05] to
[1:27:06] know. And when you are
[1:27:08] concerned, you will get into the word
[1:27:10] and study
[1:27:12] it. So this morning, I'm praying that
[1:27:16] some of of your questions will be
[1:27:19] met and that the Lord will minister to
[1:27:22] your
[1:27:23] heart. So the message, why what is the
[1:27:27] message? The message I I think I'm
[1:27:30] having problems with the microphone
[1:27:31] here. I don't know which one I should
[1:27:32] use because this one is on and off,
[1:27:34] brethren. So the the message uh what is
[1:27:37] the message exactly?
[1:27:42] The
[1:27:44] message
[1:27:45] is the voice of
[1:27:50] God through a
[1:27:53] prophet to a
[1:27:55] people. It doesn't have to be William
[1:27:57] Brham.
[1:27:59] Even what I'm preaching to you this
[1:28:01] morning is a message.
[1:28:04] So anyone who God has
[1:28:07] sent is preaching a
[1:28:10] message. But there are many preachers in
[1:28:12] every
[1:28:15] generation. And all these preachers will
[1:28:17] preach a
[1:28:19] message. But there is always one prophet
[1:28:22] in the
[1:28:25] generation. And that prophet will always
[1:28:28] preach the message.
[1:28:33] I'll give you many examples. You know,
[1:28:34] we had there was a time in the whole
[1:28:37] world when God sent one prophet to the
[1:28:40] whole
[1:28:41] world and his name was
[1:28:44] Noah. Noah had the
[1:28:48] message. He does. You know, I want you
[1:28:50] to
[1:28:51] imagine the whole wide
[1:28:55] world, no all the continents that we
[1:28:57] know
[1:28:58] of, they had to listen to the message of
[1:29:01] one
[1:29:03] man. Is that
[1:29:07] realistic? Is it realistic?
[1:29:13] You're not sure,
[1:29:15] but as far as I'm concerned, it does not
[1:29:18] sound too
[1:29:26] [Music]
[1:29:28] realistic. Imagine to say that God has
[1:29:31] sent me, I'm the only preacher for the
[1:29:32] whole
[1:29:36] world. You will tell me, "Yeah, pastor,
[1:29:39] Are you sure it was God who sent
[1:29:41] you? Not to say I'm not a preacher, but
[1:29:45] you will have many many questions
[1:29:48] answered. You mean your
[1:29:50] message will go in all continents of the
[1:29:54] world. You It will even go up to
[1:29:57] Greenland, Antarctica. Antarctica. It
[1:30:00] will go in all these areas. Australia,
[1:30:03] America, Canada, you know, all the way
[1:30:06] to all Africa.
[1:30:08] to
[1:30:09] Europe, all these places, Asia and my
[1:30:13] message has to go to all those places.
[1:30:16] I can now tell you my message me as
[1:30:20] me is not meant to go to all those
[1:30:23] places but it is meant to come to you
[1:30:27] local. So in every generation, God has
[1:30:30] local
[1:30:32] ministers, local
[1:30:34] prophets, people he will anoint to
[1:30:37] preach to
[1:30:39] countries, to to areas, to to churches,
[1:30:44] you know, portions of people here and
[1:30:46] there, you know, and some have bigger
[1:30:49] ministries than others.
[1:30:51] God has given me grace to go to
[1:30:53] Ethiopia, send a message there and then
[1:30:57] I was their
[1:30:58] messenger to bring them the message and
[1:31:01] then here also and maybe go a few
[1:31:04] countries here and there but that is an
[1:31:06] isolated
[1:31:08] ministry a very small ministry and there
[1:31:11] are many preachers like
[1:31:13] that and there are others with bigger
[1:31:15] ministry and God will use them to speak
[1:31:17] to
[1:31:19] nations but See, according to Bible
[1:31:23] prophecy, there are ministries that God
[1:31:26] sends to the whole
[1:31:28] world. And that one
[1:31:31] man, God trusts him so
[1:31:34] much that he sends him to speak to the
[1:31:37] whole
[1:31:39] world. I want you to imagine how big
[1:31:42] that response
[1:31:44] is. People like Noah, his message was
[1:31:48] not for his place.
[1:31:50] His message was not for his town or his
[1:31:54] country. The message of Noah was for the
[1:31:58] entire world including
[1:32:01] Uganda. Uganda and the message was it is
[1:32:05] going to
[1:32:07] rain. The message was it is going to
[1:32:10] rain and if you don't enter my
[1:32:13] boat, you are all going to be destroyed.
[1:32:16] Anyone who refused to believe that
[1:32:19] message under the
[1:32:21] curse, they were going to die because
[1:32:24] that message was the only thing that
[1:32:27] could stay the
[1:32:30] curse. How many were saved that
[1:32:33] day? Only eight
[1:32:35] people including the
[1:32:39] messenger. There were many people who
[1:32:41] were
[1:32:42] wise. They built their own boats.
[1:32:46] Maybe if there was
[1:32:48] CNN, they made big
[1:32:51] news trying to show how foolish Noah
[1:32:54] is. How foolish the people are that are
[1:32:56] following
[1:32:58] him. But how can a man
[1:33:00] say, he only has a
[1:33:03] message and his message is the only
[1:33:06] truth and everybody else should leave
[1:33:08] whatever they believing and follow
[1:33:11] him. Isn't this ridiculous?
[1:33:15] and and he is saying that the whole
[1:33:18] world is going to
[1:33:20] drown. And then they they went into this
[1:33:23] kind of things of checking uh you know
[1:33:25] the
[1:33:27] water and according to the science of
[1:33:30] that
[1:33:31] time. They could not see any
[1:33:34] evidence that it was going to
[1:33:37] rain. But God had spoken to his
[1:33:41] son and he had told him it was going to
[1:33:43] rain.
[1:33:46] It was up to the people to believe it or
[1:33:47] refuse
[1:33:49] it. But when God sends a
[1:33:52] man, his message cannot
[1:33:56] fail. Men will try to say anything they
[1:33:59] want. But his message is not for
[1:34:03] everyone. His message is meant for a
[1:34:06] group of people that were meant to
[1:34:07] believe it and accept
[1:34:11] it. And Noah preached and preached and
[1:34:16] preached and finally some people
[1:34:18] believed the
[1:34:19] message and they entered the ark and
[1:34:22] then as they were still in the
[1:34:24] ark the doors were
[1:34:27] shut. It started raining and they were
[1:34:31] like ah this man was a right
[1:34:35] man. Should we first please don't worry
[1:34:39] we have our own thoughts. And when the
[1:34:42] airs began
[1:34:44] capsizing that's why they oh we need the
[1:34:47] other
[1:34:48] one let us go in we have a lot of
[1:34:52] technology we have a way we can jump
[1:34:55] in it
[1:34:57] work it never worked God closed the
[1:35:01] door when the door is closed no one can
[1:35:06] enter and even in this generation we
[1:35:09] have a message And this is a message of
[1:35:13] grace. This is the only message which
[1:35:17] will stay the
[1:35:18] car. But there are many people playing
[1:35:20] with this
[1:35:22] message, ridiculing and speaking
[1:35:24] whatever they want to say. But let me
[1:35:27] tell you brother one of these days the
[1:35:30] door is going to
[1:35:31] shut. And when the door shuts they will
[1:35:35] begin waking up.
[1:35:37] And those the ones who are going to be
[1:35:40] feeling
[1:35:41] terrible, they are the ones who had come
[1:35:44] into the
[1:35:45] message and went out. You know how many
[1:35:48] people came into the
[1:35:50] ark when Noah was
[1:35:53] building. How many remember? Very many
[1:35:55] people came in, right? They came and
[1:35:58] helped Noah to
[1:35:59] build and as they were
[1:36:01] waiting seven days they would go 10 one
[1:36:07] year. There is nothing
[1:36:09] here. It is all
[1:36:11] fake. They are repeating the same
[1:36:14] message over and
[1:36:16] over. They keep quoting what their
[1:36:18] prophet told
[1:36:20] them. They keep quoting it as if to say
[1:36:24] it will help. It will bring the rain
[1:36:27] down. They keep quoting. They are tired
[1:36:30] of that. Even in our churches, we can
[1:36:34] enjoy better
[1:36:36] preaching. We can hear better things.
[1:36:39] Let's go back. And they went back and
[1:36:42] and apostle Paul said they went back
[1:36:45] from they went out of us because they
[1:36:48] were not a part of
[1:36:51] us. Whoever is a part of this message
[1:36:55] cannot leave the
[1:36:59] message. I cannot leave
[1:37:01] myself. I am the
[1:37:04] message. Amen. I am the message. Why?
[1:37:08] I'll show it to you here. So you see, I
[1:37:10] cannot leave myself. But when they
[1:37:13] leave, it is because they never knew
[1:37:16] what it
[1:37:18] was. They were make believers.
[1:37:23] We preach here about make
[1:37:25] believers. Make believers are very
[1:37:29] dangerous. They will stay for a
[1:37:33] while. They will look for
[1:37:35] mistakes. They will point out
[1:37:38] mistakes and then after a long
[1:37:40] time they will leave. An unbeliever
[1:37:43] doesn't even stay for a day.
[1:37:48] But I a make a
[1:37:49] believer will stay long
[1:37:52] enough until you think he's one of
[1:37:56] you and then he will
[1:37:59] leave. That's why sometimes you know
[1:38:02] people pressure me or
[1:38:05] excommunicate. Some people don't even
[1:38:07] want to waste my time excommunicating.
[1:38:12] They have already showed their true
[1:38:15] colors and you show your true
[1:38:18] color by standing with the
[1:38:22] word and those who live. They will be
[1:38:26] very quick to point
[1:38:29] mistakes, mistakes in the mistakes in
[1:38:33] the believers, mistakes in the
[1:38:35] church, problems in the church. Who told
[1:38:39] you that believers of this message don't
[1:38:42] have
[1:38:44] mistakes? The reason why we are
[1:38:47] believers is because we have many
[1:38:51] mistakes, many
[1:38:53] errors, many
[1:38:55] troubles. And that's why we are
[1:38:58] believers. Why? Because we know one
[1:39:01] thing. We do not have any power within
[1:39:04] us to
[1:39:06] overcome. There's something in this
[1:39:09] message which is changing our life every
[1:39:13] day. And that is why we are here because
[1:39:16] we want to be
[1:39:18] changed. We want to overcome the
[1:39:21] world. We want to be in the boat.
[1:39:25] to be in the message so we can go in the
[1:39:28] rapture outside of this message. It is a
[1:39:32] curse.
[1:39:35] So today I want us to get into
[1:39:38] that and Noah later on it came and
[1:39:42] drained
[1:39:43] and and the people remembered when it
[1:39:45] was too
[1:39:47] late. I I I don't know how he looked at
[1:39:51] them. We shall look at those brethren.
[1:39:54] We are in our among
[1:39:56] us playing
[1:39:59] around when the rapture has gone.
[1:40:05] Do you know they will be the most
[1:40:06] serious in the
[1:40:09] tribulation? They will come in our
[1:40:12] churches because we have left it for
[1:40:15] them. They will hold fasting and prayer.
[1:40:20] They will be too
[1:40:22] serious. Seriously, they will be too
[1:40:24] serious. Those of you who don't want to
[1:40:26] come to
[1:40:27] church, you will even resign your
[1:40:31] job. You will come here and pray day and
[1:40:37] night and you will even look for
[1:40:39] death. You will not get
[1:40:42] it because you have to face the
[1:40:46] wrath, the tribulation period.
[1:40:50] The system would have taken over the
[1:40:53] world. But the bride of
[1:40:56] Christ will be with the
[1:40:59] Lord. She will be
[1:41:01] preparing to come back into the
[1:41:04] world. This same earth, the Bible says
[1:41:08] we shall inherit
[1:41:09] it. We are going to come back here and
[1:41:13] we shall be lords over the people of the
[1:41:17] earth. So It depends on what your vision
[1:41:21] is. If you believe this
[1:41:24] message, believe it without with all
[1:41:26] your
[1:41:27] heart, without
[1:41:29] doubting. You may have problems in your
[1:41:32] own personal
[1:41:36] life. Don't you worry about
[1:41:39] that. The word will take care of
[1:41:41] that. Keep coming and sitting
[1:41:44] under. He will wash you clean.
[1:41:48] He will perfect
[1:41:49] you. The reason why we have the word and
[1:41:53] the Holy Ghost is to perfect
[1:41:56] us. He knows that we are not
[1:42:00] perfect. But he is
[1:42:03] perfect. You don't worry about your
[1:42:07] weaknesses and worry about doubting this
[1:42:11] message. Never doubt the message. Never
[1:42:15] question the message because it is God's
[1:42:18] provided
[1:42:20] way that will always stay the
[1:42:26] cast. Okay, follow me closely here
[1:42:29] now. So Elijah
[1:42:31] ministry is promised to come before the
[1:42:34] Lord
[1:42:37] comes. It is very
[1:42:39] important because the world is under a
[1:42:42] curse and they needed to be restored
[1:42:45] back to the
[1:42:47] savior so that they they can stay the
[1:42:52] cast and I want you to
[1:42:55] see first of all who is the
[1:43:00] savior who these are basic
[1:43:06] things. Sometimes we preach this and
[1:43:08] this until you don't know what you
[1:43:11] believe. So who is our
[1:43:15] savior? Let's begin with that. Who
[1:43:18] redeemed us? The prophet does not redeem
[1:43:21] us. Elijah does not redeem. Elijah does
[1:43:25] not save us. Elijah does not give us
[1:43:27] grace in our hearts to receive the
[1:43:30] word. He doesn't fill us with the Holy
[1:43:32] Ghost.
[1:43:33] Elijah is a man like me, like
[1:43:36] you, but God uses him in a special way.
[1:43:39] A special
[1:43:41] way. And who is our
[1:43:43] savior? Christ Jesus is our
[1:43:46] redeemer. And I've never
[1:43:49] seen any religious
[1:43:51] movement that lifts up Christ more than
[1:43:55] this
[1:43:57] message. In this message, we lift up
[1:44:01] Christ.
[1:44:03] They lift
[1:44:04] money. We lift Christ. They lift riches.
[1:44:09] We lift the
[1:44:10] rapture. They lift cars and
[1:44:13] prosperity. But we lift righteousness
[1:44:15] and
[1:44:17] holiness. It is in this message that
[1:44:21] Christ
[1:44:22] Jesus is preached more than any
[1:44:24] religious
[1:44:27] movement. So some of you have been
[1:44:30] thinking
[1:44:32] We are just followers of William Bron.
[1:44:35] You need to go back to
[1:44:37] school. You need to learn what this is
[1:44:39] all
[1:44:40] about. This is much more than William.
[1:44:44] This is about unveiling of Jesus
[1:44:49] Christ. It's about understanding the
[1:44:53] word. Actually, when you come to the
[1:44:55] message, you were a Bible reader
[1:44:58] before. And when you come to the
[1:45:00] message, you open the Bible, it will be
[1:45:04] a new book to
[1:45:05] you. Brother, listen. You understand it
[1:45:08] in a much better
[1:45:11] way than you used to understand
[1:45:14] it. The message lifts
[1:45:17] Christ out of history and
[1:45:22] brings Colossians
[1:45:25] 3:13. Christ has redeemed us from the
[1:45:27] curse.
[1:45:30] who is our
[1:45:34] redeemer. Come on now, you can preach
[1:45:36] with me. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:45:42] Who is our
[1:45:45] redeemer? Being made a curse for
[1:45:50] us. For it is written, cursed is
[1:45:53] everyone that hangeth on a
[1:45:57] tree that the blessing of
[1:46:01] Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[1:46:05] through Jesus
[1:46:11] Christ that we
[1:46:13] also might receive the promise of the
[1:46:16] spirit through faith.
[1:46:20] You remember the blessing of
[1:46:22] Abraham. I'll bless them that bless
[1:46:25] you. I'll cast them that
[1:46:28] cursed. You remember
[1:46:31] that? You know, Abraham was blessed by
[1:46:35] God. No one could
[1:46:38] curse. And the Bible here
[1:46:40] says the blessing of
[1:46:43] Abraham comes through Christ.
[1:46:52] The blessing of Abraham,
[1:46:55] it comes on what? On the Gentiles.
[1:47:00] Now, oh my
[1:47:03] God. I was inspired on this thing. I
[1:47:07] believe it will help some
[1:47:09] people.
[1:47:10] Listen.
[1:47:12] Malachi was a prophet to the Jews.
[1:47:18] All the promises and blessings he was
[1:47:21] mentioning did not have anything to do
[1:47:23] with us the Gentiles.
[1:47:27] It was for the Jews.
[1:47:30] Even Christ came to the
[1:47:35] Jews. Everything was for the Jews. Why?
[1:47:38] They are children of the
[1:47:41] promise. We were not. We were like dogs.
[1:47:45] But I want you to see
[1:47:48] something. We as
[1:47:51] Gentiles, we are somehow connected
[1:47:56] in that
[1:47:58] blessing by
[1:48:00] faith through Christ
[1:48:03] Jesus. So then the
[1:48:05] promises that were for the
[1:48:08] Jews automatically become our promises.
[1:48:13] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:48:16] Elijah the Dishbite
[1:48:18] came to the Jews. Amen. Elisha came to
[1:48:22] the Jews. Nothing to do with the
[1:48:25] Gentiles. Where we are the Gentiles.
[1:48:27] They were on earth. But they were the
[1:48:30] outcast. But now when Malachi
[1:48:33] 4, he gives a prophecy right at the end
[1:48:37] of the Old
[1:48:39] Testament. Amen. Trying to show you
[1:48:41] something. And there is another
[1:48:43] testament
[1:48:45] coming. And that testament will not be
[1:48:49] sealed by blood of bulls and
[1:48:52] goats. It will be sealed by the blood of
[1:48:55] one that
[1:48:57] died. He would become a
[1:49:00] curse for the entire not the Jews only
[1:49:03] now but for the entire human race.
[1:49:08] Jesus became a
[1:49:10] curse for the entire human
[1:49:13] race. And now the Bible would say there
[1:49:16] is no male or female. There is no Jew or
[1:49:20] Gentile. Why? He's seeing everybody
[1:49:23] now through the
[1:49:26] blood. And that's why the prophecy of
[1:49:29] Malachi 4 was not fulfilled in the Old
[1:49:33] Testament. It was supposed to be
[1:49:35] fulfilled.
[1:49:37] In the New Testament, it was supposed to
[1:49:40] be fulfilled.
[1:49:42] Amen. When the new covenant was coming,
[1:49:46] listen church, the new covenant which
[1:49:49] was coming was not for the Jews
[1:49:52] only. It was for the Gentiles
[1:49:55] also. So if he says, "Behold, I will
[1:49:59] send
[1:50:00] you who? The ones that are going to
[1:50:03] receive the Messiah.
[1:50:06] [Applause]
[1:50:08] Who is going to receive the
[1:50:10] Messiah? Who is going to receive the
[1:50:12] Messiah? The Jews and the
[1:50:15] Gentiles. Did the Jews receive the
[1:50:18] Messiah? The Bible says he came among
[1:50:21] his own. But his own received him.
[1:50:25] No. But to as many as have received
[1:50:28] him. to them to them gave he power to
[1:50:34] become the sons of
[1:50:36] God. So beloved, the Bible says now are
[1:50:41] we the sons of
[1:50:44] God. We took the place of the
[1:50:48] Jews. That is why we can receive a
[1:50:52] prophecy which was meant for them and we
[1:50:55] receive it as if it is ours.
[1:50:59] We parttook of the
[1:51:05] blessing. I'm telling you these things
[1:51:07] are
[1:51:09] sweet. Follow me closely
[1:51:13] now. He says Christ has redeemed us from
[1:51:17] the
[1:51:18] curse of the law being made a curse for
[1:51:23] us. For it was written cursed is
[1:51:25] everyone that hangeth on a tree.
[1:51:30] that the blessing of
[1:51:32] Abraham might come on the Gentiles,
[1:51:37] on the Gentiles,
[1:51:39] through Jesus
[1:51:41] Christ that we might receive the promise
[1:51:44] of the
[1:51:46] spirit
[1:51:48] through faith. Are you learning? Romans
[1:51:54] 8:1. Amen. Now the
[1:51:57] curse was the curse of
[1:52:01] sin. Okay. Okay. Now, now follow me
[1:52:04] closer. When the law was
[1:52:07] given and uh it was supposed to be
[1:52:12] obeyed, everyone that disobeyed the
[1:52:17] law was under the
[1:52:21] curse. So now we were all born
[1:52:24] disobedient.
[1:52:27] under the
[1:52:28] curse. The curse of sin. Sin is
[1:52:32] unbelief. Sin is refusing to believe the
[1:52:35] word of
[1:52:37] God. And the way the law
[1:52:40] was, it made people
[1:52:43] disobey. You know, even today you can
[1:52:45] see it. If they
[1:52:48] say no
[1:52:50] passing, you will find people trying to
[1:52:52] say, "How can I pass without being seen?
[1:52:58] That's what the law
[1:52:59] did. The law made us
[1:53:02] sinners. The law made us naked.
[1:53:06] The law condemned
[1:53:07] us. But you see, when Jesus
[1:53:11] came to
[1:53:14] change
[1:53:17] things, he came that we might have have
[1:53:21] freedom.
[1:53:23] He came that we might be free.
[1:53:26] He came that condemnation can be
[1:53:27] removed.
[1:53:29] He came that we might be stayed from the
[1:53:36] curse. There's only one one curse and
[1:53:39] that's the curse of
[1:53:42] sin. And anyone who has not received
[1:53:44] Christ in their
[1:53:46] life is under that
[1:53:49] curse.
[1:53:51] Anyone who has not believed
[1:53:54] him is under that
[1:53:56] curse. You remember Jesus spoke to the
[1:54:00] Pharisees and he told them you are but
[1:54:03] whosoever that does not believe in
[1:54:06] me is condemned
[1:54:09] already. So meaning condemnation of the
[1:54:14] curse is upon every nonbeliever.
[1:54:22] That's why it is important for you not
[1:54:24] to marry an unbeliever.
[1:54:28] Even you're marrying or getting married
[1:54:30] to somebody who is under a
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:40] curse. All the curses and demons and
[1:54:43] spells of his family lineage are still
[1:54:46] on. You want to marry or get married to
[1:54:49] third, you need to
[1:54:52] know that people who believe the
[1:54:55] word, they were taken out of those
[1:54:58] things, they were put under the blessing
[1:55:01] of the
[1:55:03] word, you are put under the blessing
[1:55:05] which maketh
[1:55:07] rich. Now if you go back and mingle with
[1:55:10] such,
[1:55:12] you don't know what you're talking
[1:55:13] about.
[1:55:16] The Bible here then
[1:55:18] says through Jesus Christ the blessing
[1:55:22] of
[1:55:23] Abraham came upon the
[1:55:25] Gentiles. And so now here in Romans
[1:55:28] 8. Now remember Romans were
[1:55:32] Gentiles. So Paul writes to them and he
[1:55:35] says these words, "There is therefore
[1:55:40] now no
[1:55:42] condemnation to them which are in
[1:55:46] Christ." He did not say there is
[1:55:48] therefore now no condemnation to the
[1:55:50] Jews, not to the Gentiles. But he said
[1:55:53] to them which are in Christ
[1:55:56] Jesus. Amen.
[1:55:59] To them who walk not after the flesh.
[1:56:03] But to them that walk after the
[1:56:06] spirit. And then he continues and says,
[1:56:09] for the law listen is another
[1:56:11] law. For the law of the spirit of life
[1:56:15] in Christ
[1:56:18] Jesus. There's that
[1:56:23] law. Law of
[1:56:25] spirit of life. Spirit of life. That
[1:56:30] spirit of life.
[1:56:32] which is in Christ
[1:56:33] Jesus. So when you receive the Holy
[1:56:35] Ghost after believing the word, you have
[1:56:38] received the
[1:56:40] spirit, the quickening
[1:56:42] spirit, the quickening
[1:56:44] power. So it's a
[1:56:47] law working in
[1:56:49] you. Amen. So the spirit, the law of
[1:56:53] spirit of
[1:56:55] life has made me free from the law of
[1:56:58] sin and death.
[1:57:03] That's why we can't
[1:57:04] die. That's why we can perish. That's
[1:57:07] why we can't go to hell. Because there
[1:57:10] is another
[1:57:11] law working in our
[1:57:14] soul. The law of spirit of
[1:57:16] life in Christ
[1:57:19] Jesus. That one has set us
[1:57:22] free from the law of
[1:57:26] sin. Which means we cannot sin
[1:57:30] even. The Bible says they that are born
[1:57:33] of
[1:57:34] God cannot
[1:57:36] sin because the sin remains. I want you
[1:57:39] to
[1:57:40] understand a
[1:57:42] believer. A true born again child of
[1:57:45] God cannot
[1:57:48] sin and cannot
[1:57:53] die. It's the word of God.
[1:57:57] I cannot sin. I cannot die. You cannot
[1:58:03] sin. You cannot
[1:58:05] die. Believe
[1:58:09] it. Believe it. Is it easier to believe
[1:58:13] it? No. That's why to be a believer is
[1:58:20] special. Amen. That's why we are
[1:58:23] believers. Father, we are
[1:58:26] special. We are a royal
[1:58:28] priesthood. We are a royal
[1:58:30] priesthood. Hallelujah. We are peculiar
[1:58:33] people. We are special in this
[1:58:35] world. We are not to be mistaken by for
[1:58:41] others. We have the
[1:58:44] law operating in
[1:58:46] us. The law of spirit of
[1:58:49] life and has made us free from the law
[1:58:53] of sin.
[1:58:56] Amen. Now, that's why Jesus
[1:59:00] came. That's why he died. That's why he
[1:59:03] gave his life's blood. That's why he
[1:59:06] came and died on the cross. So that we
[1:59:10] can receive this law in
[1:59:13] us. You
[1:59:15] know, is fighting because there is
[1:59:18] another
[1:59:19] law working in it. is the law of
[1:59:24] sin. But you see your body is an
[1:59:28] unbeliever. But you see there is another
[1:59:31] one in
[1:59:32] you. Your soul has the law of spirit of
[1:59:36] life. You know no matter how the body
[1:59:39] functions and
[1:59:40] works, the body will end up in the
[1:59:44] grave, but your soul will end up in the
[1:59:47] rapture. Always remind your flesh.
[1:59:51] always remind it I am not a citizen of
[1:59:54] this world. I am not a citizen of this
[1:59:59] country. Amen.
[2:00:02] That's why a believer does not die.
[2:00:06] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Now listen
[2:00:14] friend. In every
[2:00:16] age, you know Christ died once.
[2:00:20] The Bible says once for
[2:00:22] sin he entered into the holy of
[2:00:26] holies not more than
[2:00:29] once. So there's no other
[2:00:32] death to save or to redeem. Christ has
[2:00:36] already redeemed.
[2:00:39] But in every
[2:00:42] generation, in every
[2:00:46] dispensation, God has to hand out the
[2:00:52] people. Uh what I would call
[2:00:56] the imputation of
[2:01:00] grace, of
[2:01:04] righteousness. He hands it out.
[2:01:09] in every
[2:01:12] dispensation. He died for the living at
[2:01:15] the
[2:01:17] time and those that would come in the
[2:01:21] future he died for both Jew and
[2:01:26] Gentile. But you see in every
[2:01:28] age the people of that
[2:01:31] generation they have to receive that
[2:01:35] blood.
[2:01:39] and accept
[2:01:41] it. Don't worry, you'll understand what
[2:01:42] I'm
[2:01:43] saying. Actually 2:39 says, "The promise
[2:01:47] is unto
[2:01:50] you, the
[2:01:52] Jews, to your
[2:01:54] children, the Jews, to all those that
[2:01:57] are far
[2:01:59] off, the
[2:02:01] Gentiles, and even as many as our Lord
[2:02:04] shall call,
[2:02:06] the Jews and the Gentiles.
[2:02:11] So the
[2:02:12] promise,
[2:02:14] hallelujah, of the spirit,
[2:02:17] the Bible says we shall
[2:02:19] receive through
[2:02:24] faith. It is not
[2:02:27] automatic. In every generation, the
[2:02:30] receivers of that
[2:02:31] promise, they will receive it through
[2:02:36] faith. Faith in what? Faith in the
[2:02:39] finished
[2:02:40] work. How shall they know? He says, "How
[2:02:44] shall they know without a
[2:02:47] preacher?" So he will send a preacher.
[2:02:50] But there are many preachers and
[2:02:52] everyone is saying something
[2:02:54] different. That's why God is a God of
[2:02:56] order.
[2:02:58] In Romans 3:7 he says he will do
[2:03:02] nothing but he will send his servant the
[2:03:05] prophet in every generation. He will
[2:03:08] send one
[2:03:09] prophet and that prophet will be the
[2:03:15] measurement will be the
[2:03:17] basis of what the believers of that
[2:03:22] age. failure to subscribe to
[2:03:26] that. You are under a
[2:03:28] curse. The same curse that Jesus took
[2:03:32] away, you are under it because you have
[2:03:35] refused to believe in Jesus
[2:03:39] Christ. You saying the message of of
[2:03:42] these
[2:03:43] prophets is Jesus
[2:03:45] Christ. Yes. Is speaking through
[2:03:52] them. Amen.
[2:03:55] Now, this
[2:03:56] promise for both Jews and
[2:03:59] Gentiles in the Ephesian church
[2:04:01] age and brother be ready with that first
[2:04:04] uh picture on the church ages. It says
[2:04:08] John the messenger at the
[2:04:11] time walking in the midst of those seven
[2:04:13] golden
[2:04:16] candles. It was Jesus
[2:04:19] Christ working in the midst of the c
[2:04:24] the almighty
[2:04:25] God. What is he doing? He didn't say he
[2:04:29] was working in one
[2:04:33] candlestick. Let me have a picture,
[2:04:35] brother. He was walking in the midst of
[2:04:38] all of
[2:04:40] them. We are now in the book of
[2:04:43] Revelation. That's what I'm reading
[2:04:45] about.
[2:04:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He was walking
[2:04:50] in the midst of all the
[2:04:53] What does that denote? That he is the
[2:04:57] same God yesterday, today and forever.
[2:05:01] And in every church age to every
[2:05:05] believer, he comes with the Holy Ghost,
[2:05:08] to every age and to every person it is
[2:05:13] same yesterday, and
[2:05:15] forever. as you see there's church
[2:05:18] agents.
[2:05:20] Brother, can you give me this picture
[2:05:22] when you've zoomed it out and make sure
[2:05:24] everything can be
[2:05:27] seen. Praise the name of the
[2:05:30] Lord. The rapture consists of saints
[2:05:33] from every
[2:05:36] age, believers in every generation.
[2:05:41] The messenger of each
[2:05:44] age had the message of that age that
[2:05:47] stayed the
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:52] cast. So when we say brother where are
[2:05:54] the
[2:05:55] stars when we
[2:05:57] say that um you know we have an end time
[2:06:03] message which has stayed the
[2:06:05] cast. We are not talking about our time
[2:06:09] only. We are talking about even the
[2:06:12] times before
[2:06:13] us. God has been
[2:06:16] moving. Not in our generation
[2:06:18] only. This I'm talking about a
[2:06:21] dispensational
[2:06:24] gospel. The message of Christ is a
[2:06:26] dispensational gospel.
[2:06:37] This you must
[2:06:38] understand. We are not the only
[2:06:41] saints. There are others before
[2:06:44] us. So when we talk about the
[2:06:46] message, it's not only the message of
[2:06:48] our
[2:06:50] time. We're talking about the message
[2:06:52] even
[2:06:54] before. Remember it is the blood that
[2:06:57] has reconciled us to
[2:06:59] God. But every one claims to have the
[2:07:02] word.
[2:07:05] You see, but the Bible puts this
[2:07:09] distinction and this is what I want us
[2:07:11] to get
[2:07:12] into. Where is the blood
[2:07:15] today? Where is the word
[2:07:17] today? If you see these church
[2:07:20] ages, right from the first
[2:07:22] one, you know, these are
[2:07:27] candlesticks. In the book of Revelation,
[2:07:30] it says there was one like a son of man.
[2:07:34] walking in the midst of the
[2:07:37] candlestick. The candlestick means a
[2:07:39] church.
[2:07:42] Jesus has one
[2:07:44] church but that church is spread
[2:07:49] out in many
[2:07:54] generations from the days of the
[2:07:57] apostles up to
[2:08:01] today. The first church age was called
[2:08:05] Ephesus. And in every church age, God
[2:08:08] sends a what?
[2:08:12] A prophet, a messenger. Then comes
[2:08:16] Paul. Paul the apostle was the first
[2:08:20] messenger. Brother said, "How did I come
[2:08:24] up come up with all these
[2:08:28] messengers?" He says he used to preach.
[2:08:32] The first principle
[2:08:33] here he said was the the the
[2:08:38] messengers had to be patterned according
[2:08:40] to the first
[2:08:45] messenger. So there he looked number one
[2:08:48] thing he looked at was the
[2:08:52] pattern. So you see Paul was a man of
[2:08:55] God and in that
[2:08:58] pattern. He said Paul was true to the
[2:09:02] word. He never deviated from
[2:09:05] it. He always was believing the
[2:09:08] word. He always took the stand of the
[2:09:11] word not the seminary or
[2:09:15] organization. And then he say another
[2:09:17] way in that button he said Paul was a
[2:09:21] man of the
[2:09:23] spirit. He never preached in word
[2:09:26] only but power signs and
[2:09:29] wonders the
[2:09:31] supernatural was following his
[2:09:34] grace. And then he said another way that
[2:09:37] Paul had the evident fruit of his
[2:09:39] ministry.
[2:09:44] So that was the first
[2:09:45] way that brother was able to pattern all
[2:09:48] these other
[2:09:52] messengers and he said the other way was
[2:09:55] by divine
[2:09:58] inspiration. So now we see that he was
[2:10:00] able to tell each church age and their
[2:10:04] [Music]
[2:10:06] message. Paul was the one of the first
[2:10:10] one 53 AD to 170 AD.
[2:10:17] And that was the first church
[2:10:19] age up to 170 to
[2:10:21] 80. And then comes
[2:10:23] Iranas. Iranas from to the age
[2:10:27] of 17 to
[2:10:32] 312. Read the church age book to get the
[2:10:37] details. Not everything can be talked
[2:10:39] about on the pool.
[2:10:41] Just get into the book and
[2:10:43] read. If you don't have it, please read
[2:10:46] it. I'll shall give it to you. It's good
[2:10:48] to know the history of the
[2:10:51] church. Amen. Some of you have read
[2:10:54] European
[2:10:56] history. This is church history.
[2:11:00] Now, the age
[2:11:02] of 312 to
[2:11:05] 606. Martin was the messenger.
[2:11:10] 606 to
[2:11:13] 1520 and God used a man
[2:11:17] called 1520 to
[2:11:21] 1750. Come
[2:11:23] sadis and God used a man called
[2:11:26] Luther. I've talked about him many
[2:11:29] times. Then come 1752
[2:11:34] 1906 in the age of God flood of fear.
[2:11:38] the missionary
[2:11:39] age. And then God uses a man called John
[2:11:43] Whizzley. And each of these
[2:11:46] men had a thus saith the Lord for their
[2:11:53] age. And their
[2:11:55] message stayed the
[2:11:57] curse in that generation where
[2:12:01] they
[2:12:03] come. Where are we right now?
[2:12:12] 2025. How many
[2:12:14] years? More than 50 years since God sent
[2:12:18] William
[2:12:20] Brown to this age. There are others God
[2:12:23] used in the
[2:12:25] beginning. There was a man called
[2:12:27] William
[2:12:28] Sime. at the beginning of this
[2:12:31] age. God used him atus and other
[2:12:35] people in the Pentecostal
[2:12:38] revival. But you see their
[2:12:41] revival was only
[2:12:44] one-sided. They did not have the uh
[2:12:52] mechanics but they had a
[2:12:55] dynamics. Listen, they had a
[2:12:57] supernatural signs, wonders, miracles,
[2:12:59] and all these
[2:13:02] things, but they never had the
[2:13:03] restoration of the
[2:13:05] world. That's why they were not the
[2:13:09] messenger. But we see the
[2:13:12] messenger of the very last
[2:13:15] age will have both the restoration of
[2:13:18] the
[2:13:20] word and the power.
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:28] two-sided and we see that ministry was
[2:13:31] through William
[2:13:34] and that was the last one. So what comes
[2:13:37] next now?
[2:13:39] Hey, what is coming
[2:13:40] next? The rapture of the
[2:13:43] church. Amen. I am thinking of the
[2:13:47] rapture in a blessed home on earth when
[2:13:51] the
[2:13:52] redeemed are
[2:13:54] gathering. That's what we are waiting
[2:13:56] for. We are waiting to gather
[2:13:59] in actually we already gathering
[2:14:03] in with this message of your life.
[2:14:06] Hallelujah. The messenger of each
[2:14:10] age. He had the
[2:14:13] message that stayed the
[2:14:17] curse. Remember, it is the blood that
[2:14:20] reconciles us back to
[2:14:23] God. But
[2:14:25] everyone today in the world, they claim
[2:14:29] to have the
[2:14:30] word. But you see the Bible says the
[2:14:33] word has reconciled
[2:14:36] us. The blood has reconciled us. The
[2:14:39] word has reconciled us.
[2:14:41] Meaning the blood became the
[2:14:46] word. The Bible is going to give us a
[2:14:50] distinction here.
[2:14:52] Now don't miss this thing here.
[2:14:57] Now listen, follow
[2:14:59] closely. We have
[2:15:01] something that we can be able to
[2:15:03] differentiate and
[2:15:05] say these ones have missed it.
[2:15:10] have
[2:15:11] it because everyone has
[2:15:14] this. The Bible, the Catholics have it.
[2:15:18] The Orthodox have it. The angry can have
[2:15:21] the But why have they missed it? They're
[2:15:24] missing
[2:15:26] something. They have missed the
[2:15:29] messenger's
[2:15:32] message. Let me show you. Let me show
[2:15:34] you. 2 Corinthians
[2:15:37] 5
[2:15:39] 18. And all things are of
[2:15:44] God, who has reconciled us to
[2:15:50] himself by Jesus Christ, and he has
[2:15:54] given to
[2:15:55] us the ministry of
[2:15:59] reconciliation. Listen to we that God
[2:16:03] was in Christ.
[2:16:06] reconciling the world to
[2:16:09] himself. Not Are you following me?
[2:16:13] That's 10% of you. Are you following me?
[2:16:16] Not imputing their trespasses unto
[2:16:20] them. And he has committed unto
[2:16:23] us the
[2:16:25] word of
[2:16:28] reconciliation.
[2:16:30] Okay. Everyone believes the blood of
[2:16:32] Jesus.
[2:16:35] They even sing about
[2:16:37] it. This Sunday
[2:16:41] morning Catholic church they sing
[2:16:45] the you know we sing a song that is sung
[2:16:47] across
[2:16:50] ordinary the
[2:16:51] blood of Jesus and they claim to believe
[2:16:55] the
[2:16:55] blood. But let us put it to a
[2:16:59] test. Do they really believe the blood?
[2:17:02] Do they accept the blood? Where is the
[2:17:06] blood? Do you have some little bottles
[2:17:09] of the blood of
[2:17:12] Jesus? Can we pass it around and sell
[2:17:15] it? Come on
[2:17:17] now. There is no bottles of the
[2:17:21] blood. If it was, we would just be
[2:17:24] drinking and selling it
[2:17:26] around. If they had it, they would be
[2:17:29] selling it. But many of them sell
[2:17:32] oil. They sell holy
[2:17:34] water. But they don't have blood because
[2:17:38] blood you can
[2:17:40] sell. Blood. The Bible says freely you
[2:17:43] have
[2:17:43] received freely came. He is the one who
[2:17:47] paid the
[2:17:48] price and blood is
[2:17:50] somewhere. I said blood of
[2:17:53] Jesus is
[2:17:55] somewhere. There is a place where it is.
[2:17:59] In that place is received for
[2:18:02] free. For
[2:18:04] free. No
[2:18:06] payment. That the
[2:18:09] currency, the currency with which you
[2:18:11] buy
[2:18:12] it is called
[2:18:15] faith. Faith. Faith. But where is the
[2:18:19] blood today? The blood is the
[2:18:22] word. Hallelujah. Amen. The blood is the
[2:18:25] word.
[2:18:27] The word that reconciles us to God in
[2:18:31] the blood of
[2:18:33] Jesus. And that blood, that word comes
[2:18:37] by every
[2:18:40] messenger in one age. God sent a
[2:18:44] messenger. Where's the picture, brother?
[2:18:47] Amen. We are talking about the gentile
[2:18:51] church. Brother Marvin, do I still have
[2:18:53] that picture?
[2:18:55] Oh, in the first eight, God, Amen, gave
[2:19:00] Paul the
[2:19:01] blood. He said, Paul, here is the blood.
[2:19:05] Go and apply it. And then Paul came. He
[2:19:08] was a bold man. And he spoke words. And
[2:19:11] he said, the words I speak to
[2:19:13] you, the words I speak to you are not
[2:19:17] words. Man is wisdom
[2:19:20] teaches. Amen. And then he said, "Be it
[2:19:23] unto you
[2:19:25] known that they are the
[2:19:28] commandments of God." He said, "If we or
[2:19:33] another messenger or an angel from here,
[2:19:36] come and preach
[2:19:41] another. If he comes and preach another
[2:19:44] gospel other than the one I
[2:19:47] preached, me and the apostles and
[2:19:50] someone comes and
[2:19:52] Let him be
[2:19:55] cast. You see now why? Because Paul's
[2:19:59] message stayed the C. If you believe
[2:20:03] Paul's message, you are not under the
[2:20:06] curse. But if you refused it, you were
[2:20:09] under a
[2:20:11] c. And what was Paul's message? Paul
[2:20:15] preached. Women must not be
[2:20:18] pastors. It means every church, every
[2:20:22] preacher that believes in women pastor
[2:20:26] is under the curse.
[2:20:28] And Paul preached, "You must be baptized
[2:20:32] in much water in the name of the
[2:20:35] Lord, which means everybody who
[2:20:38] doesn't suddenly under."
[2:20:43] Paul said,
[2:20:44] "Women dress in
[2:20:48] mother's come here help me preach this
[2:20:53] morning." Hallelujah. Amen. He said,
[2:20:55] "Dress in
[2:20:57] modesty. This is
[2:20:59] modesty." Hallelujah. Amen. But you see,
[2:21:03] what happens? Come here. You find
[2:21:07] girls dressing like
[2:21:09] this. That's not modesty.
[2:21:13] There's a problem that's not
[2:21:16] modest. Why? They are under a
[2:21:19] curse. The curse of sin, the cast of
[2:21:23] blindness, the
[2:21:25] unbelief. But those who believe in the
[2:21:28] message of the
[2:21:30] messenger, they were stayed away. The
[2:21:33] curse was
[2:21:36] stay there was no more condemnation.
[2:21:42] Amen. And Paul set the
[2:21:46] pattern. His message was the
[2:21:49] blood. No doubt about
[2:21:53] that. His message was the
[2:21:56] blood. Even he himself could not change
[2:21:59] it. No man can change it. No apostle can
[2:22:03] change it. It was given by
[2:22:07] God. Amen. In every age.
[2:22:10] God has committed to them the
[2:22:13] word meaning the
[2:22:15] message that stayed the curse of
[2:22:18] God. Hebrews 9:12, neither by the blood
[2:22:22] of goats and
[2:22:25] calves, but by his own
[2:22:29] blood, he entered in once into the Holy
[2:22:33] P obtained eternal
[2:22:38] redemption for
[2:22:40] us who Christ
[2:22:43] Jesus. Amen. Amen. I said amen.
[2:22:48] What is the
[2:22:49] message? The message is the bleeding
[2:22:52] word.
[2:22:57] Did you understand it? If you understood
[2:23:00] it, shout
[2:23:01] amen. The message is the bleeding
[2:23:06] word. Okay, let me quote it now. In the
[2:23:09] message, the invisible union of the
[2:23:10] bride of
[2:23:12] Christ. Glory. That's why we caught. We
[2:23:16] are caught in the
[2:23:19] bleeding. Hallelujah.
[2:23:22] What is
[2:23:23] sin? Sin is
[2:23:25] unbelief. Unbelief in what? In the
[2:23:29] world? Unbelief in
[2:23:31] God, which is the
[2:23:35] word, the pure
[2:23:39] unadulterated. Your
[2:23:41] garments washed by the water of the
[2:23:43] blessing.
[2:23:46] The word became
[2:23:48] black. The word bled for
[2:23:52] you. You are
[2:23:54] washed in the bleeding
[2:23:58] word.
[2:24:01] Amen. Do I have believers
[2:24:05] here? Do we have them here
[2:24:08] today? Hallelujah. Amen. They preach
[2:24:11] visa and they shout.
[2:24:14] They preach miracle and they shout this
[2:24:16] is much greater than all
[2:24:19] of Hallelujah.
[2:24:23] Glory. The word became the
[2:24:27] blood. You are
[2:24:30] washed. Not me only.
[2:24:33] You me. We
[2:24:37] are in a bleeding
[2:24:40] word. The word bleeding.
[2:24:44] the life of God in the
[2:24:45] word. The word was bled for you that you
[2:24:49] might be washed from the filth of these
[2:24:54] prostitutes of these
[2:24:56] prostitutes and be cleaned and be
[2:25:01] sanctified by the washing of the water
[2:25:03] of the word.
[2:25:07] Hallelujah. And make your mind and your
[2:25:10] heart stayed on God.
[2:25:14] and on his
[2:25:18] word. And on his
[2:25:22] what?
[2:25:23] Amen. End time evangelism. He says each
[2:25:27] age has its message and it
[2:25:31] messengers all through the times.
[2:25:34] Every age has sparked his message with a
[2:25:40] messenger. God in every
[2:25:43] dispensation has sent forth
[2:25:46] someone has sent forth
[2:25:48] someone
[2:25:50] anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring
[2:25:54] forth his message for
[2:25:59] that. God has anointed someone.
[2:26:04] God has anointed
[2:26:06] someone. I can tell you he has anointed
[2:26:09] me, but I'm not that
[2:26:11] man. There is one man in the
[2:26:14] age that God has anointed. And his name
[2:26:19] is Brother. Hallelujah.
[2:26:22] His name is William. William. What is
[2:26:27] his name? Brother. Hallelujah. Amen. So
[2:26:29] you know his name.
[2:26:32] What about you brother? Oh, I was
[2:26:34] waiting for someone who was going to say
[2:26:35] something
[2:26:37] else. Let me ask this young sister. She
[2:26:40] always preaches at at school. What's the
[2:26:43] name of that one
[2:26:44] messenger? Maybe everybody's giving
[2:26:46] wrong answer. Please help them.
[2:26:51] Oh my
[2:26:52] god. Oh my god. Hallelujah. Even in the
[2:26:55] mouth of
[2:26:57] babies, God has already declared
[2:27:00] it. But if someone doesn't believe it,
[2:27:04] I want to tell them you are too
[2:27:10] late. Hallelujah. Amen. What is the
[2:27:14] proof? I am the proof that I have been
[2:27:18] restored. I received a message. I've
[2:27:21] been restored back again. To the
[2:27:23] beginning before I fall. This message
[2:27:28] has stayed the cast. I cannot be cast
[2:27:31] anymore.
[2:27:32] I have been redeemed by the blood of
[2:27:35] Jesus. That is why we believe the
[2:27:38] message. It is not a man. It is more
[2:27:42] than a
[2:27:44] man. Hallelujah. Amen. These
[2:27:48] messengers. This
[2:27:50] man of God that he has anointed in every
[2:27:56] area. Don't doubt it.
[2:27:59] And if someone comes close to
[2:28:01] you doubting it, brother, sister, let
[2:28:05] them stay with their
[2:28:09] curses. Let them stay with their
[2:28:11] cars. Yes, sir. You know, let me tell
[2:28:14] you something. One time Abraham have
[2:28:17] always quoted
[2:28:19] this. He went with his
[2:28:21] servants and his servants stayed down
[2:28:24] there and he was going up on the
[2:28:27] mountain to worship.
[2:28:29] You know let me tell you he has said in
[2:28:30] the Bible he has given us the blessing
[2:28:33] of
[2:28:34] Abra but Abraham
[2:28:37] worshiped Abraham gave the sacrifice of
[2:28:41] worship. True worship is belief of the
[2:28:49] truth. But you see, you know, as he went
[2:28:52] up on the
[2:28:53] mountain, the other ones who were
[2:28:55] carrying the
[2:28:56] donkeys, the servants, there are some
[2:28:59] people who have been around us for some
[2:29:02] time in the message 10 years, 5 years
[2:29:07] 20, 30, 40, but they were never really
[2:29:10] going to make the
[2:29:12] sacrifice. Some were just
[2:29:16] servants carrying the
[2:29:18] donkeys. But you know what? When they
[2:29:21] reach on the bank of the
[2:29:23] mountain, Abraham turned to his boy, he
[2:29:26] said, "Boy, take this firewood. Let's go
[2:29:29] up on the mountain. And as for you
[2:29:32] servants, stay with the donkeys. Stay
[2:29:35] with the donkeys. My son and I are going
[2:29:38] up the mountain to
[2:29:41] worship. It is time, brethren. It is
[2:29:45] time, friends. Those of you listening to
[2:29:47] me today, for some of you, you turn to
[2:29:51] some of the people, you call your
[2:29:53] friends, you call your leaders, you call
[2:29:56] your whatever, I don't care who you
[2:29:58] call, if they don't believe this
[2:30:01] message, tell them stay with the
[2:30:08] donkeys. Did someone hear that? Stay
[2:30:11] with the donkeys. Come on, say it right
[2:30:14] now. Stay with the donkeys.
[2:30:16] They ought to stay with their donkeys,
[2:30:18] their donkeys of sin, the donkeys of
[2:30:21] unbelief, the donkeys of religion. As
[2:30:24] for me and my house, we are going up the
[2:30:27] mountain. We are going to offer the
[2:30:30] sacrifice. Hallelujah. Amen. We have
[2:30:33] arrived where we are to to worship the
[2:30:36] Lord in spirit and in
[2:30:39] truth. The bleeding word is
[2:30:42] here. But as for them, they can stay
[2:30:45] with their
[2:30:48] donkeys. Hallelujah. Whenever you come
[2:30:51] close to an unbeliever, to a doubter,
[2:30:55] tell them with a donkey. But as for me,
[2:30:59] I'm going to worship.
[2:31:03] Hallelujah.
[2:31:05] Was it really a messenger?
[2:31:07] Yes, sir. I doubt it.
[2:31:11] Stay with your daughter.
[2:31:13] No, no, no. Let me tell you, William
[2:31:17] died. He was
[2:31:19] knocked. He was knocked.
[2:31:23] No, brother. Why are you changing? He
[2:31:26] died
[2:31:27] badly. Is the truth. Who will not die
[2:31:30] badly?
[2:31:34] Even John the Baptist himself, the
[2:31:37] Elijah before him, they cut off his
[2:31:40] head. I can tell you he died
[2:31:45] badly. But that does not mean he was not
[2:31:47] a
[2:31:49] messenger. As a matter of fact, when
[2:31:51] Jesus comes, the man
[2:31:55] decreases and Jesus
[2:31:58] increases. Why William died?
[2:32:02] Jesus has engraved.
[2:32:05] This is a Jesus based
[2:32:09] church. We are Jesus
[2:32:13] believers. But as for the others who
[2:32:15] don't who don't believe
[2:32:16] it, tell them
[2:32:20] to tell them to stay with their donkeys.
[2:32:23] But for us, we believe it. Do I have
[2:32:26] those who believe it here in the
[2:32:28] church? Hallelujah.
[2:32:32] Amen. Brother,
[2:32:37] please, please, please work on my
[2:32:38] interpreter. I want us to walk with him.
[2:32:40] All right? Cuz I'm still having one one
[2:32:42] or two more doses here before we finish
[2:32:44] in in the message. The fifth seal,
[2:32:49] notice the first Elijah that were that
[2:32:52] was
[2:32:53] him. That was him. The second Elijah was
[2:32:57] Elisha. The third was John.
[2:33:01] Now when brother reaches
[2:33:04] Abraham the
[2:33:07] fourth he doesn't say was
[2:33:11] me. So he
[2:33:13] says the
[2:33:15] fourth was the seventh
[2:33:20] angel or the last
[2:33:23] messenger. So he introduces a new term
[2:33:25] here.
[2:33:27] Now, seventh
[2:33:29] angel. So we want to know who's the
[2:33:30] first, second, third,
[2:33:33] fourth. You see, according to Malachi 4
[2:33:37] and Revelation 107. Now the fifth
[2:33:41] time, he is a messenger to the
[2:33:45] Jews, to the
[2:33:48] 144,000 after the church is gone.
[2:33:52] Many people say yes there was Elijah
[2:33:56] there was
[2:33:57] Elishah John then no one else up to the
[2:34:01] one who is coming to the
[2:34:03] Jews but anyone who would say that is
[2:34:07] uneducated is doesn't understand the
[2:34:09] Bible because then where is the
[2:34:14] Gentiles where are they in the
[2:34:17] world God is a God of a good economy
[2:34:23] He blesses everybody
[2:34:26] properly, even Gentiles. We have
[2:34:29] partaken of the Jewish
[2:34:32] blessing. And we too have received an
[2:34:36] Elijah. Amen. Amen. If Jesus did not
[2:34:41] come, then the Jews, the Gentiles would
[2:34:43] not have received an
[2:34:46] Elijah because we had nothing to be
[2:34:48] restored to.
[2:34:51] But because amen Jesus came and he died
[2:34:55] and he redeemed us and he brought us the
[2:34:58] word then now over the
[2:35:01] ages the word has been
[2:35:03] diluted the word has been forfired the
[2:35:06] word has been redeemed removed. So then
[2:35:10] God had to send an Elijah
[2:35:13] ministry to the Gentiles to restore the
[2:35:17] word back.
[2:35:22] Are you following
[2:35:25] me? Now in I'm reading the Ludian church
[2:35:28] 8. This messenger of Malachi
[2:35:32] 4 and Revelation
[2:35:34] 10:7 is going to do two things. Are you
[2:35:38] ready for them?
[2:35:41] Amen. Especially you who don't come on
[2:35:44] Wednesday. Let your amen be louder
[2:35:49] now. One, according to Malachi
[2:35:53] 4, he will turn the hearts of the
[2:35:56] children to the
[2:35:59] fathers. two, he will reveal the
[2:36:03] mysteries of the seven
[2:36:06] thunders in Revelation
[2:36:08] 10 which are the revelations contained
[2:36:11] in the seven
[2:36:15] se. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Number one,
[2:36:19] he will turn what the hearts of the
[2:36:23] children. Where are the
[2:36:27] children? Hello
[2:36:29] children. Hello
[2:36:31] children. We are the children of God.
[2:36:35] Our
[2:36:37] hearts are going to be turned
[2:36:39] back. You know those people. The spirit
[2:36:43] of the age has made us instead of being
[2:36:47] a
[2:36:50] church
[2:36:53] without you find our
[2:36:55] churches they
[2:36:58] dancing you know that kind of thing with
[2:37:01] their small dresses
[2:37:04] pants and they say let's give a dance to
[2:37:08] Jesus and then they begin throwing their
[2:37:10] legs
[2:37:15] You know, other people like, "Oh yeah."
[2:37:20] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What is it? The
[2:37:24] church is
[2:37:25] dead. The world is in the
[2:37:28] church. They are no longer entertained
[2:37:31] by the
[2:37:32] word. They are entertained by the
[2:37:35] world. But there must be a prophet.
[2:37:41] a message that will restore the
[2:37:44] church, back to the
[2:37:47] original, back to true
[2:37:49] worship, back to the
[2:37:52] Bible, Amen, that ministry must be
[2:37:55] here. Anyone that doesn't believe
[2:37:58] it, they happy with what the devil is
[2:38:01] doing. They are happy with infant
[2:38:04] baptism.
[2:38:09] Name this child name
[2:38:19] reject the world and all things
[2:38:31] therein. Godfather
[2:38:36] Women are
[2:38:38] [Music]
[2:38:40] that is deception of the highest
[2:38:44] woman. A big man asking for a
[2:38:47] child. The child is believing by
[2:38:54] proxy. Some of you are in those
[2:38:57] denominations. Some of you don't know
[2:38:58] what you're talking
[2:38:59] about. But some of you are there. You
[2:39:02] were deceived. But God called you
[2:39:05] up. The message we have
[2:39:07] believed has called
[2:39:10] us and we are restored back to the
[2:39:14] original, back to the apostolic
[2:39:17] faith, back to the Bible.
[2:39:22] We are the true original Bible
[2:39:27] [Applause]
[2:39:29] believers. And we believe the Bible is
[2:39:33] the
[2:39:34] absolute because the message we believe
[2:39:38] has not brought a new
[2:39:40] idea. It has restored us back to what
[2:39:44] was
[2:39:47] before. Tell me, is there any doctrine
[2:39:52] Is there a teaching that the message
[2:39:55] taught that is not
[2:39:58] here? The message is not new. It is the
[2:40:03] original. We are restored back
[2:40:06] again. There is no new
[2:40:08] ideas. Don't ever think that,
[2:40:12] brother. Some of you get
[2:40:14] confused. You think this message is a
[2:40:17] new
[2:40:18] idea, a new revelation. No, it is the
[2:40:22] old.
[2:40:24] If you're not, sing with me. Give me
[2:40:25] that old time red. Oh, give me
[2:40:29] that time. Now give me that. Oh,
[2:40:36] it's good. All right. Wait. You sung
[2:40:39] well only that you sang like
[2:40:43] Catholics. Let us sing it again. Like
[2:40:46] Pentecostal. Give me that all time
[2:40:49] religion. Give me that all time. Will
[2:40:53] you give me that old time religion is
[2:40:56] good enough for me. Listen, it was good
[2:41:00] for our fathers. It was good for our
[2:41:04] fathers. Well, it was good for our
[2:41:07] fathers. Is good for me. Okay. It was
[2:41:11] good for brother Brham. It was good for
[2:41:15] brother. He was the messenger of our
[2:41:16] age. Good for
[2:41:19] brother is good enough for me. What is
[2:41:23] the old time religion?
[2:41:26] The old time religion is Jesus
[2:41:29] Christ is the Bible is the word is
[2:41:34] righteousness holiness of the Holy
[2:41:37] Ghost. God is the old time
[2:41:41] religion and that's what we have been
[2:41:43] restored to.
[2:41:45] Amen. He will reveal the mysteries of
[2:41:47] the seven
[2:41:49] thunders in revelation 10 which are the
[2:41:52] revelations contained in the seven
[2:41:55] [Music]
[2:41:57] seals. Amen. So we are the people that
[2:42:02] have received the true revelation of the
[2:42:05] seven thunder.
[2:42:08] So can I now say we are the true seven
[2:42:11] thunder people.
[2:42:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. We are the
[2:42:19] truth seven thunder
[2:42:23] people. Why? Because the Malachi 4
[2:42:28] prophet, Revelation 10 prophet when he
[2:42:31] comes, he will reveal the
[2:42:34] mysteries in those seven
[2:42:37] thunder of Revelation
[2:42:39] 10. Because you know when the thunder
[2:42:42] when the thunder thundered
[2:42:45] And then John was about to
[2:42:46] write the mysteries contained in there.
[2:42:50] But the voice told him John shut it up.
[2:42:54] John don't write anything. But this is
[2:42:57] verse seven.
[2:42:59] act in the days of the voice of the
[2:43:04] servant joy. When he begins to sound,
[2:43:09] the
[2:43:10] mystery, the mysteries of the
[2:43:12] thunders shall be
[2:43:15] finished. When are those days coming? We
[2:43:19] are living in those
[2:43:20] days. Hallelujah. Amen. The seventh
[2:43:23] angel
[2:43:25] messenger has come.
[2:43:32] Amen. Amen. Elijah has come. Tell your
[2:43:35] neighbor, Elijah's come. Elijah has
[2:43:38] come. And when Elijah comes, everything
[2:43:41] is finished. Everything is restored. The
[2:43:45] church is waiting but for the
[2:43:48] rapture. And now the seven
[2:43:52] thunder
[2:43:54] movement is on.
[2:44:00] We are the seven thunder
[2:44:04] revival. What are the seven
[2:44:06] thunders? They are the
[2:44:08] revelations contained in the seven
[2:44:15] seals. Amen. What are those
[2:44:18] revelations? You are looking at
[2:44:23] one. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:44:27] I am the
[2:44:28] revelation contained in
[2:44:30] there. I am you are it is the revelation
[2:44:35] of the
[2:44:37] bride.
[2:44:42] Hallelujah. Don't complicate
[2:44:45] it. You are the revelation of the
[2:44:49] book. When the book is open, when the
[2:44:53] seal is
[2:44:54] loosed, behold the bride.
[2:44:58] Hallelujah. The bride is
[2:45:01] revealed. We now know who we
[2:45:03] are. We are the bride. We are not just
[2:45:07] the church. We are the bride of
[2:45:10] Christ waiting for the
[2:45:13] rapture. And I'm waiting for that
[2:45:17] chariot to swing
[2:45:19] low. And I'll
[2:45:21] step on my way. I will ride to heaven.
[2:45:26] of guru.
[2:45:27] [Applause]
[2:45:29] Go maring. I can see you be one of them.
[2:45:32] Sing it. When the saint Oh, go maring.
[2:45:37] Well, when I say go maring,
[2:45:41] I'll be
[2:45:43] there to be a number. When the saints
[2:45:48] When the saints go
[2:45:55] [Music]
[2:46:00] Amen. Amen. We have been revealed,
[2:46:07] the original
[2:46:09] life. Oh my. Hallelujah. You know that
[2:46:13] song, the original
[2:46:15] life, the original seed, the original
[2:46:19] one is what I
[2:46:22] believe. The seventh seal is
[2:46:28] revealed. Uhhuh. The original life. The
[2:46:33] original
[2:46:34] se. Listen now to this part. We are the
[2:46:38] word made flesh
[2:46:40] today. We are the word made
[2:46:44] flesh. We are the seven
[2:46:47] thunder.
[2:46:49] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:46:53] We will be so
[2:46:55] changed alive and so changed filled with
[2:46:58] the Holy Ghost living for God that you
[2:47:02] will make the devil have a
[2:47:04] headache. You will become a thunder to
[2:47:07] the
[2:47:08] devil. He won't know what to do with
[2:47:11] you. What are you? You are the seventh
[2:47:14] son
[2:47:15] [Applause]
[2:47:17] revealed. Amen. We are the word made
[2:47:20] flesh of Jesus.
[2:47:22] This is what the
[2:47:25] scriptures and our names are seen
[2:47:28] within redeemed and perfect.
[2:47:33] Yes, we
[2:47:34] are anointed. Hallelujah. Amen. And we
[2:47:39] are by our God
[2:47:42] who is the
[2:47:44] original. The original life. Hallelujah.
[2:47:48] The original se. Thank you Lord. The
[2:47:51] original one glory is what I believe.
[2:47:55] Will the son of man is revealed? The
[2:47:59] seven seal is unveiled. The original
[2:48:03] land,
[2:48:05] the original
[2:48:07] se. Amen.
[2:48:10] Amen. Some have made the seven thunder
[2:48:13] as some kind of cout movement.
[2:48:20] I am not a
[2:48:21] cult. I'm not a
[2:48:23] movement. I am a
[2:48:27] person. I'm
[2:48:29] revealed. I'm
[2:48:31] unveiled. And then the other part of me
[2:48:35] that is
[2:48:38] waiting is him to come. And then he too
[2:48:45] says when he comes I shall be like
[2:48:49] him because we are two parts of
[2:48:54] the same
[2:48:56] person. Christ is the head. We are the
[2:49:01] body. If we want we can complicate the
[2:49:05] message. If we want we can make it
[2:49:07] simple as the word
[2:49:10] is. Amen. Amen. Oh my. Now let me try to
[2:49:16] land this plan
[2:49:21] tonight. We are told in Revelation
[2:49:24] 10 that there will be a messenger in the
[2:49:26] last
[2:49:28] day and he will gather up these loose
[2:49:32] ends and will bring them
[2:49:35] together and then the mystery of God
[2:49:38] would be
[2:49:39] finished at the sounding of this angel.
[2:49:42] which was the messenger of the
[2:49:44] ark. What will he do? He will gather up
[2:49:49] these little
[2:49:52] ends. So there are many preachers who
[2:49:55] have
[2:49:56] come and there have been men of
[2:49:59] God over the ages. But you see when this
[2:50:03] prophet of Revelation 10:7
[2:50:06] comes who is also the prophet of Malachi
[2:50:09] 4, he's going to tie the loose ends
[2:50:14] together. Some people think brother Bana
[2:50:17] made up what he
[2:50:20] taught. The word of God is not for
[2:50:22] private
[2:50:24] revelation. Let me tell you, if God
[2:50:26] revealed something to
[2:50:27] me, he will reveal it to you.
[2:50:31] He doesn't have private
[2:50:34] revelation. It's God
[2:50:36] revealing. Sometimes I've seen myself
[2:50:38] preach someone's
[2:50:40] here and then I see another preacher
[2:50:42] preach the
[2:50:45] same. Did you copy what I
[2:50:48] did? No. The word of God is public
[2:50:53] domain. So you find many things
[2:50:57] preached. They were all before.
[2:51:02] all preach but people who preach them
[2:51:06] did not preach it in the full revelation
[2:51:08] there.
[2:51:12] So what was the work of the prophet of
[2:51:16] revelation? It was to tie the loose
[2:51:19] ends. Say yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No.

[3:21:46] Thank you, Jesus. Be with us this week,

[3:22:11] Lord. And may you give us the boldness
[3:22:14] to stand for your

[3:22:18] hour, everyone in their own private
[3:22:20] space, whatever they
[3:22:22] be. Give them grace to stand that they
[3:22:25] may be with

[3:22:34] In the name of
[3:22:36] [Music]
[3:22:40] our Lord bless you
[3:22:43] saints. The song will lead us in a song
[3:22:46] as we
[3:22:49] dismiss be here again on
[3:22:54] Wednesday that will be
[3:22:57] Apo. So um if all goes well
[3:23:03] I'm planning to travel around this
[3:23:09] Easter.
[3:23:11] Um, but if I but we we we as a church we
[3:23:15] know we have we have been invited to the
[3:23:18] convention, the Easter
[3:23:21] [Music]
[3:23:23] convention. So please let us try our
[3:23:26] best to get there.
[3:23:30] There are two things we need to
[3:23:32] do. We need to save ourel that camp
[3:23:37] fee. If you're not going to stay
[3:23:41] there, please it's a small
[3:23:47] amount 35,000.
[3:23:52] Let's try to save
[3:23:55] that as
[3:23:57] individuals and then as a church we have
[3:24:01] been trying to uh do
[3:24:03] pledges. I've not got an update on how
[3:24:07] much but I would like to request all
[3:24:09] those who
[3:24:11] pledged to please fulfill your
[3:24:14] pledges so that we can support our
[3:24:16] sister
[3:24:18] church. Uh I know it takes having
[3:24:23] organized u uh international gatherings
[3:24:28] for the past three
[3:24:33] years. I know it's not
[3:24:36] easy. So let's support when we
[3:24:43] can take 200,000
[3:24:46] there. It would be good for you to do
[3:24:48] that.
[3:24:50] But that's too
[3:24:52] little. Bring it. Let us join it
[3:24:55] together and then you will take only the
[3:25:00] comfort and let us gather something
[3:25:03] today which we can
[3:25:06] give. Is that
[3:25:08] amen? And the meetings is beginning this
[3:25:13] 17th. Uh that means next
[3:25:17] week next
[3:25:21] week that's when the the conversion is
[3:25:23] started.
[3:25:25] As
[3:25:26] usual we usually have our Sunday
[3:25:31] service we participate in all the other
[3:25:35] days but we maintain the Sunday
[3:25:39] service. We only have one service in the
[3:25:42] morning. Those who want to be in the
[3:25:45] conversion on Sunday, it's
[3:25:49] still Yeah. But we will have to maintain
[3:25:52] our Sunday
[3:25:55] service. Is that
[3:25:57] understood? All the other
[3:26:01] services and participate and it's a good
[3:26:03] thing the meetings are beginning on
[3:26:05] Thursday after our Wednesday.
[3:26:10] We will not have any of our services
[3:26:15] interrupted. So please try and
[3:26:18] participate as much.
[3:26:21] I think I've announced that in a very
[3:26:23] good
[3:26:25] [Music]
[3:26:26] way for the past three weeks. We have
[3:26:30] been announcing
[3:26:32] this and we don't want to ashame our
[3:26:37] fellowship you find you are going
[3:26:39] there you have no
[3:26:43] comfort. You remember in our confession
[3:26:45] we told them don't come without comfort.
[3:26:49] We should be
[3:26:52] examples. Don't go without
[3:26:56] comfort. Don't say I don't have so I
[3:26:58] want to
[3:27:00] go. That's a bad
[3:27:03] attitude. You've had enough
[3:27:06] time. We've been announcing for some
[3:27:10] time. So, you've had some time to look
[3:27:12] for
[3:27:13] that. It's not so big. try your
[3:27:18] best those meetings I've
[3:27:21] noticed when we have a
[3:27:24] convention and our people participate in
[3:27:27] this it helps them
[3:27:30] spiritually it is a very good thing you
[3:27:33] should always
[3:27:35] participate it's a shame if you stay at
[3:27:39] home in a holiday like
[3:27:41] that because it's a Easter holiday it's
[3:27:44] a shame for you to stay at
[3:27:47] or go visit your
[3:27:52] family of your relatives who are not
[3:27:54] even
[3:27:57] unbelievable unless if it's your mom or
[3:28:01] your father or your sister but the
[3:28:04] distant
[3:28:10] relative it would be a shame. Let's try
[3:28:13] our best brethren.
[3:28:15] be in such meeting. So we are not
[3:28:18] announcing it
[3:28:21] lightly. We want you to go because it
[3:28:25] those meetings are a
[3:28:27] blessing. Is it a
[3:28:29] man? Amen. Parents look for funds to
[3:28:32] support your
[3:28:34] children. She will save you from a lot
[3:28:36] of trouble.
[3:28:38] Young sisters, young
[3:28:40] brothers, go and take your unbelieving
[3:28:44] friends because there there will not be
[3:28:46] anyone to watch you and say, "Ah, you
[3:28:48] have this one as your
[3:28:52] friend." No one knows you
[3:28:54] there. Check all your friends
[3:28:57] there. Who knows what the Lord will
[3:29:00] do such a meeting. Well, the Lord bless
[3:29:04] you. We're going to have a minister's
[3:29:06] meeting now.
[3:29:09] and then
[3:29:11] afterwards we shall go to minister
[3:29:14] in say God bless you. I'll not mention
[3:29:19] names of course been there have been
[3:29:21] those that have consistently supported
[3:29:25] you know a few well for us to always
[3:29:28] drive
[3:29:31] there's a sister last Sunday who gave me
[3:29:34] 100,000 shillings
[3:29:38] for the
[3:29:39] fuel. God bless you so
[3:29:42] much. It comes without
[3:29:46] saying. It comes without saying but
[3:29:48] ministry needs
[3:29:55] [Music]
[3:29:57] money. Those of
[3:29:59] you religiously supporting your church
[3:30:02] and the work of God,
[3:30:14] Yeah. Really may God bless
[3:30:17] you. I pray you may not

[3:30:26] not. But I assure you, you have a
[3:30:30] reward. God bless you.
