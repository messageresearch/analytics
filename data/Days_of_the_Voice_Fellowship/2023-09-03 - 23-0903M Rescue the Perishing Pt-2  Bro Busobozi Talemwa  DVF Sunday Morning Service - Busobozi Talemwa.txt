[Music] away [Music] so what I wanted to show you is just a few slides [Music] a few pictures that are really important for you to see um [Music] I know brother Isaac could show it online but I wanted you here to see it again [Music] is that going to work brother Isaac China [Music] my wife and I a few years ago took a trip to uh to Ethiopia [Music] Ethiopia but before we got married we knew that the Lord had a you know a mission for us there is started about three years before I I got married actually and I wanted to go to Ethiopia but they started as a desire because at that time I was you know traveling from place to place [Music] you know several African countries but now it became intense in 2011 when I went to um Zimbabwe for a mission trip it would appear that whenever I open my bible to read foreign [Music] sister came and spoke about Ethiopia like he's mentioned about Ethiopia about 10 times and so it drew my attention I started now wanting to find out whether they were Believers in Ethiopia stand out that there seemed not to be a church even a church of the message in Ethiopia Ethiopia so one time I went to sorority how many know pastors introduced me to a brother who had been in Ethiopia um this brother had visited another brother in Ethiopia so apparently this brother was from Kenya yeah and so we tried to contact him to allow us to come and visit this is what he told me he said well of course after several words that were exchanged and he had asked me a few questions like how old are you name are you married are you a preacher how long did you start preaching from the time you believed and then he asked me a little more questions and then it seemed that I failed the interview [Music] I'm sorry I cannot receive you in Ethiopia and also it doesn't seem that uh the field is large two friends you don't even have money and it's expensive here even the language is difficult they don't speak English so it's difficult for me to receive you here I cannot sustain you the things out and I don't feel led to receive you the food is large singers if God has sent you you will take care of it that's what he told me and I was so disappointed [Music] friends sometimes when you are turned down [Music] it doesn't mean that God has turned you down [Music] sometimes when you are turned down it is that God is opening and so I was turned down and um but somehow because of that I went before the Lord and I prayed a sincere prayer Lord if it is your will for me to go to Ethiopia provide to me the money saying that I would not have to ask anybody because [Music] I need money to go there you and um also I say Lord may you also give me a contact someone I will not need to beg to come so uh about a year and a half later in 2013. I was supposed to get married actually I was supposed to get married in December of 2012. but then I had a dream and in this dream I I saw myself um change someone asking me to change my wedding date this would be a signature that person that will ask me to do that will be the one to solemnize my weddings so I shared that with my pastor at that time out of all the friends and brothers in the ministry that I had sent out email to inform them about my wedding movie one of them wrote back and and he told me look he said brother brother we are our church is intending to have their students because they have a church school to come to Uganda Uganda we are going to visit Pastor Stephen ibalist Church in ginger together they accepted me to come rather he said if you accepted to change your debts from December to March when we are when they are coming because my daughter is coming with them I will take it as from the Lord also for me to come along this dream this what this email was saying was exactly revealed to me in the dream two weeks before it happened so it was not a problem I told Pastor Leo he had already known about it was the one supposed to wait me and my wife God had already organized for this brother to come and wear them but here is what we did not know God was also dealing with him and and his church in Canada about Ethiopia they had a burden to support the working ethics and I was in Uganda I did not have the money to go because I didn't have the money but I wanted to see God working on both sides foreign he said where are you going [Music] because we have all the resources we put them in the wedding and send this is and so he said ah I have a proposal why don't you go to Ethiopia for your honeymoon three years after the prayer I pray before I was ever in contact with this brother and and so when he said he mentioned Ethiopia boy are you getting a question he was saying honeymoon because this brother said I am going to take care of all the expenses foreign I couldn't move not because of the money she was sent but because of a prayer that God answered so perfect now you always said so perfect three years before years later he's answering the first prayer all the money we needed is [Music] when the brothers and the sisters in our little church had that I was planning honeymoon to Ethiopia some of them were offended because I remember there was a family that sold their piglets to support my wedding so they said if he had money why did you did you leave us to sell our people but I didn't have money this was completely Supernatural and so now I'm on the computer with my wife trying to book a ticket and here's what God does someone calls me from Nairobi never met him but he was on the internet and he read my website not show my website it read about me on our website website if you want you young people you can look for Rich the youth message site you you saw my testimony say to me that the Holy Spirit to invite me to Kenya um to go and baptize the people that had believed under his ministers Ethiopia so when he mentioned to me I have a group of Ethiopians and God has told me ask you especially you um [Music] immediately I knew that that was God answering the second prayers so then and this man was uh very happy to see us yes it was the very first Ethiopian I've ever interacted with in the name of our Lord Jesus came out of the world he gave us a contact of his brothers foreign it's the first time I do this so please excuse me so this is the man I don't know whether you can see him clearly there his name is I believe those who are online can view this better and if you want to view it in a better way you can view this after the service so uh you see the man standing behind there and if you see the man on the extreme right yo I always forget his name but maybe I'll remember it and so that is the man that called me and I met him there for the first time baptism a pastor rather the man called the reason you can see I was very little and small foreign so while I was preaching give me the next slide and by the way go back there oh they this place recently when we were in Nairobi I don't know if Isaac and uh Isaac remembers you remember when we were coming out of the pastor's office do you remember the man that came and approached me and foreign and uh she was uh if you see that sister with a with some papers my wife was very busy while I'm preaching she was also very busy Distributing trucks so she made friends with this sister praise the Lord so when we went to Ethiopia in Ethiopia give me the next Slide the Kenyan Ethiopian I met Ethiopia when he had the message he said I want to be the president we could not find water we found something like a Jacuzzi we paid a lot of money for it and we baptized that man there in the name of our Lord so that was the first ever Ethiopian on our mission trip in Ethiopia to baptized give me the next slide this is a priest it's a bit blurry here on the screen but you can see it better on the internet so this is uh a priest the second contact you were given he met me reached I preached to him the message he was so happy with it started crying you can't see that there because it's a bit blurry but he started crying on this picture he was actually cry my wife took this picture and so it was in our little room there and he had me tight this message I may not be baptized and follow this message because I lead many churches and I don't want to leave them let's continue around this country this man is and uh he encouraged me but he was not baptized I think now he's a doctor in theology give me the next picture so then this brother um [Music] um uh somebody says he told me this was after his baptism he says there is someone yeah she will believe this message so he was now on the phone call my wife took that picture and my wife was my partner throughout the brother if you're planning to marry someone who will do what you are doing someone who will be interested in what God is a man he calls his wife so because of my wife you can see this picture and this man called somebody and of course during the whole time you know we were moving back and forth but you see we also needed to you know eat something and you know we went to our room give me the next slide Cafe and my wife was there doing hawak um you can see the fish there and she was we had a little room with a small kitchen you can see her there she was very busy doing I did not know that I would show you this all these years later but now here I am I'm sure commercial kumasa is on the on the right and me I think this was a picture after like a few days of her baptism go to the next so that is being baptized she you know when she believed the message she came that night you know she was all full of makeup and trousers and almost all you saw the eyelids were gone she was just painting it but right now after a few years of believing it all grew back when she stopped using makeup so sister stop using makeup [Music] your natural beauty will return it um that very night at around 9 pm she wanted to be baptized I did not have a place and this was us baptizing her out Sunday we were invited in Tulu bolo but by uh give me the next Slide by uh by a the brother the brother this is the church where he was going yeah if you see if this is the past of that church that's me in the middle that is started working for the Lord right away [Music] she was one day a Believer one day and now here she was interpreting because in that church the pastor did not know English so Society had to interpret from English to or um foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to give you all their testimonies but in this slide a brother called Morgan was being baptized about a year after what I've shared with you this was June 2024 2014. um and I don't know how many years later but now in 2021 give me the next time okay go back a bit there you go okay this is significant this man here um in a vision at night God showed me we would find certain young people that would believe at a coffee shop to tell us about the names of of the universities that should not because that coffee shop was near a university and so she spoke many names of universities but there is this one that she spoke Universe where was Jesus born [Music] foreign [Music] you know my wife and I would from time to time talk to him from the moment we got married with my wife we have kept people in our homes and God calling many of those to serve what has made you a believer foreign touching the underground of a building underground and so he was telling the people this is see the sowing time and we are sowing sea to she can see the seed of the world bring forth and I'm happy to see that most of those brothers that were there are now preaching this message so this is a preacher now he's been I've been hearing from him he's going around the country preaching especially in the southern areas is now like the associated by the mortgages um we are so glad to see him also coming into Ministry amen uh I will actually show you is like he's like uh ministering in another church which were started in another city so this is the church Hallelujah next slide is the same church his name is the one that sponsored our first trip as a gift to our animals so here he had gone to have meetings with them give me the next slide but still the church is over there next to her is uh uh the wife of Pastor Marcus she's from Kenya Kenya next to her is the mother of brother Ephraim the sister was always sad because she lost her husband died after believing this message but a few week months after you know being in the church God filled up with the Holy Ghost and all the sadness went away I can give you testimonies of almost each of them if you see this man here over there that's the man that God rose from the dead who the people called the second Lazarus and the whole village is not believing because of you know of his resurrection I said this message is alive there's nothing Our God cannot do what is a man was dying with TB comes he almost died but God raised him put flesh back on his eyes you know gave back his hair and tuberculosis that is the God of this message for someone to make me doubt that God is in this message praise God give me the next slide this is the church now in awasa there are also quite a few uh several people there one year that's Ephraim ministers person currently FM of course you're not married here in Uganda Uganda and is currently in entebbe right now with his family we're talking a family unfortunately he was not able to make it to church but [Music] um I'm traveling on Tuesday together with him together although I will not be uh necessarily going with him on the onward Journeys in Ethiopia but the church was established the church is moving on Growing Up pastorship of brother Morgan now and now give me the next slide I'm asking you to please pray because I'm returning now again Ethiopia this time I'm going into the new areas and I'm asking you to please pray that what God did then you will be able to do it again amen is a god that is the same yesterday today and foreign imagine what it did before he can do again amen and we cannot duplicate what he has done [Music] but he does the same thing over here so I have this these are places that God has placed on my heart so I ask you for your prayers I'll be away for about 10 days [Music] he's coming to minister so please come again we have our services on Saturday on Wednesday Saturday so today I'm going to speak to you how many thought that that was good for you to hear that amen it's good for you to know where your pasta is going and what is going to do again so you can give me money to support me on the trees so without knowing all this you cannot have the burden to pray there's a lot I've not told you yeah he has not used only me it's just my wife Jesus he has used many others and he's continuing to use many others as he brings his seat amen shall we stand as we go to the scripture now I think I'll preach of course for a shorter time but usually by one we are always getting done amen let us go to the Book of Luke I'm going to take part two of course this was under the series of the message of the hour [Music] specifically I was speaking on Rescue the perishing and so this will be part two of that sermon foreign verses 30. Luca is we will read up to verse 37 to remind ourselves so let's first uh speak to the Lord Jesus father you know that I'm always nervous when I'm speaking to your children because I realize it's not my ability it is your grace give me Grace tonight and they speak with them guide my lips and also give them the understandings whatever will come from bless us now Lord even The Interpreter in the name of Jesus Amen Amina so we are reading uh from verses 30. thank you brother Marvin for helping everybody so uh and I certainly appreciated all the special songs and the first service by the Martin and brother Isaac God bless you Mr services and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among among the thieves which stripped him of Israel meant and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead I think we can take it verse by verse yes [Music] and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side [Music] and likewise when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds powering in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to Annie in and took care of him [Music] when he departed he took out to Spence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou Spanish more when I come again I will repay foreign [Music] verse 37 and he said he that showed Mercy on him then said Jesus unto him go and do thou likewise yes because Jesus asked the man which of these three thinketh thou was the neighbor unto the the man that fell among the things and he said the one that showed him he said God do that likewise amen just that small chorus sit and hear what the Lord has to say [Music] rewrote my life my Mercy reward my life [Music] and I should have fallen my soul circus died [Music] oh my reward my life [Music] oh my see we wrote my life foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my life oh yes yes [Music] [Applause] I should have fallen and myself oh God [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah amen I'm going to be a little bit fast so I pray that you be attentive foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you see he he was moving from Perfection to sin again from the image of God to a worldly fleshly nature but here is what changed his life the life of this man the Good Samaritan the Good Samaritan amen when the priest came he looked the other way when the life that came he looked the other way but when the priests when the Samaritan came oh he felt compassion and he went to him he took care of the wounds we talked about that in the first service he powered you know wine in the womb now you will go home took him to the Inn now we talked about that in the first time if you miss it Go and listen to that but I want to show you today Jesus is that Samaritan yes you are like that man when you were lost in sins and all the bad things that the people do out there and let me also say this whenever we talk about lost souls many times people think it is people doing bad things does not mean a man or a person who is doing those things you remember there was a man that came to Jesus one day and this man was a good man he was a Christian man [Applause] I am more than just a good master [Applause] and so Jesus answer watch him [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] everything now to us does not mean houses what he was trying to say are you hearing me this morning are you ready to give anything foreign [Applause] mm-hmm I don't think that we are going to be in that life full of loneliness it's going to be a life a life full of jobs that is where we are going that is why we are preaching the gospel that is something on the inside Hallelujah Hallelujah by faith I am going to go there and again foreign did you know there is no one who can ever come under the preaching of the word and remain the same oh but don't you mind you tell why he may not believe it is this man was flat but he went away again I don't care how you came here this word of God you have two options that to come into the life of Jesus should come and take over foreign let me tell you the messages tell your neighbor to people tell them the message has power yeah foreign [Applause] [Music] God himself we have a deeper mandate [Applause] with me foreign [Music] foreign when he finds you in a life of sin when he finds you in the Christ less life what does he do first of all he gives you Revelation by the hearing of the world Revelation comes when you hear a preaching to you what is that it is Jesus comes by the preaching of the world why do you think when we hear the word become excited what do you think when you hear the words some people tell me I felt like shouting Gamble hallelujah hallelujah that's why when the drunkard is drunk he doesn't feel ashamed the swallow right now Kathy I cannot do what I'm doing if I'm not drunk the ambassy tell me that I can tell you right now I am drunk day right now I'm drunk cut into midday when the alcohol wears off when the wine of the Holy Ghost the wine of Revelation I will be humble again until then [Applause] why because I'm drunk I'm drunk and when you're drunk once same will disappeared that comes by the wine the river hmm foreign [Applause] to heal us people talk about um how do they call those places where people go for uh please somebody throw the name to me no places where people go for rehabilitation or people you know those people who have been on drugs they are taken into Rehabilitation praise God Jesus has his rehab yes maimed and beaten yes but what does it do yeah she sends him to his Rehabilitation Hallelujah he took him there that's what church is the even more than a place that when Jesus served he brought him later to and in and he found this man which is but if you've got a place that you can direct him too like Jesus with with the Samaritan you're taking him to the end he said a Good Samaritan taking the falling man into the ears we got to have a place like that or you know like in Ethiopia for instance when you see me or anybody going to Ethiopia our purpose is not to start a Church secretary or religious order [Applause] the purpose of evangelism is to start to bring to rescue souls to rescue Souls from the enemies of sin deceit religion you will need a place to take them to enter again why churches are started if someone now believes by my Ministry if it's another place that's why you don't be surprised to hear more churches because our purpose is to rescue Souls [Music] Uganda [Music] we do not our place it's not to start churches but if God sends a Ministries Uganda and souls get saved if there is no church nearby we start one and I'll tell you we shall stop them why why she said the church we have no Desires in those things bring a message or some kind of people following a true God called preacher have a following message again we have no desires foreign [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] that would be up charm you find they're going to the Inn let me tell you people have problems because people are supposed to have problems people have wounds if you're going through a lot of things that is how it should be baby the Bible says she has made himself the angel of Light yes the Ministers of righteousness now look at where are his ministers [Music] do you know where they are in the church some of them even as I was talking now preaching like I'm preaching and the children oh God that's the spirit of our age people are blind you should be grateful I need to send you okay because of this message because every time you come to church you know you are going to feed on something [Applause] yeah the Real Living Word of God every time you go to meet your password foreign ah anointing oil ah my footer that now take this one but because I prayed for it is so powerful anointed you just put one going into ten years ago and on your business and these people take them and they pay a lot of money for anointing oil a bottle like this one million Shillings when they can go and buy it in the market foreign means [Music] foreign [Music] Oh Glory to God this woman I showed you here the first woman in Ethiopia we found that in a condition when the pastors are deceived she went to Dubai foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] from that moment my attitude changed that's why if you know me I am not a judging person I believe God can deliver anybody and everybody in any condition this righteous than thou attitude hallelujah amen he rescued this man he rescue this man let me tell you that is what Jesus does this woman in our situations she said I want to hear what you have yes talk about judging with foreign what was going on God was rescuing she didn't see this judgments amen hallelujah in the morning she came with a gowns [Music] and that was the only place she ever had changed and that was the last time foreign God used that woman you deliver the whole country to bring the message when my wife and I went and she didn't have money we didn't have calmness upon us we had nothing but we have the message foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] very much praise God and what we have is a message to deliver those people you see those people out there invite them to church let them come and encounter this message I don't care what kind of Life they may be depressed this message the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah praise God and so we find that the church the condition is supposed to be a place where you find God called ministers that's why a minister should not stand before the people unless he has heard from God the only reason why I'm speaking to you today is because I have a message this is not a game that we're doing this man um if did not have confidence in this man um he would not have given him that response God has response God has responsibility people to take responsibility over them he doesn't want the preachers people take responsibilities over their preacher foreign [Music] foreign it's a disgrace Johnson you find
