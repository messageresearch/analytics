[13:24] by the kind of fruits
[13:31] away amen Amina and in the message the
[13:36] proverb shows us he goes deep in that
[13:40] again when he was talking about the true
[13:43] friend and the false phrase

[13:48] intertwined
[13:58] that is

[18:17] love of many will work

[20:13] we need to guard against the power of
[20:16] sin in this last time
[20:24] how many are getting so hard because
[20:26] they haven't realized the effect of the
[20:29] last day
