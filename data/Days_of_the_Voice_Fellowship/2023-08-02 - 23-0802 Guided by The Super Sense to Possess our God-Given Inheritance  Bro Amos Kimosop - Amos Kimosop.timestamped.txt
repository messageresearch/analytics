[18:35] hallelujah amen amen I greet you all in
[18:38] the precious name of Jesus Christ
[18:42] I'm rejoicing tonight because I have
[18:44] great friends with with us here tonight
[18:49] hey man uh a few weeks ago I think about
[18:52] two weeks ago we had a wonderful time in
[18:54] Nairobi with the Saints there
[18:56] is
[18:58] and it looks like they loved us because
[19:00] they are very busy following us up
[19:05] so uh brother Paul and brother brother
[19:08] Amos have been on a mission trip to uh
[19:10] Rwanda
[19:16] I said because of you but we call it
[19:21] so and I think brother Paul was also in
[19:24] some parts of Congo
[19:28] and on some of his other I usually call
[19:32] them diplomatic missions
[19:35] but I thank God that they have come our
[19:39] way as they are on their way back home
[19:44] amen I mean so uh it was very difficult
[19:49] for me because I love both brothers
[19:54] and I know but that you know I've been
[19:58] over the pool for a very long time but
[20:00] in all kind of poles
[20:03] I know there is if I begin to give the
[20:06] whole history we will not have a service
[20:07] seeing
[20:10] because I remember as far it goes as far
[20:13] as when we were you know on motorbikes
[20:16] and we were riding motorbikes as we are
[20:19] singing going for mission trips
[20:26] in the streets of uh Ethiopia especially
[20:32] to do evangelism
[20:35] and now it's been years
[20:37] it's been you know the Lord Has Done
[20:40] many wonderful things over the years
[20:43] and the most great the greatest thing
[20:47] that he has done by the poor area
[20:50] both of us are still standing in the
[20:52] messages
[20:56] amen The Anchor Holds
[20:59] and so uh I've had a long history about
[21:03] the Paul but
[21:07] I've known him for years
[21:10] but recently Nairobi we mean it's at a
[21:13] bit close they close for the first time
[21:15] travel is
[21:17] brother Paul was there uh to some of you
[21:21] who might have watched that um how do
[21:23] you call it
[21:26] TV
[21:27] yeah the panel discussion available
[21:34] several ministers are lined up and they
[21:36] are discussing on the message with
[21:43] it that's not on TV universe and so
[21:46] brother Paul was uh the the main
[21:51] panelist I don't know if that's the word
[21:55] and he I remember he told Brother Amos
[21:59] asked him a question
[22:02] was the one who started the discussion
[22:06] um
[22:07] and I was thinking oh brother almost has
[22:09] the lion anointing
[22:12] because you know when you start a
[22:14] discussion when you've not when the heat
[22:16] has not yet come up and you you are the
[22:18] one who is opening the door for
[22:20] everybody
[22:21] um
[22:29] I thought that was nice brother Amos
[22:33] and he had quite a wonderful insights of
[22:36] the world
[22:37] itself
[23:22] [Music]
[23:28] this is
[23:31] [Music]
[23:41] Uganda
[23:43] I'm jumbo
[23:45] I'm Jambo
[23:47] I have been given a very easy task
[23:51] to come and greet you good job so I'm
[23:55] doing what the pastor said I should do
[23:56] it
[23:57] but you're not responding well
[24:00] so I'll stand here until you respond
[24:08] [Music]
[24:12] I think my work is done now
[24:16] okay yeah but I would say I'm very very
[24:18] happy to be here this evening
[24:23] foreign
[24:24] [Music]
[24:27] it's really a wonderful moment for me
[24:31] to be standing on this wonderful you
[24:34] know red carpet here
[24:37] capite
[24:39] because the last time I was with you
[24:41] there was no carpet
[24:43] but now there is a carpet
[24:47] there was a tent outside
[24:51] now the building has covered
[24:56] so really I can say I'm really blessed
[25:01] [Music]
[25:08] he gave us quite some good stuff in
[25:11] Kenya yeah
[25:14] so when when they left we said we just
[25:18] want to go and Touch the Hem once again
[25:21] so we are here to receive an impartation
[25:27] and we are really getting it we are so
[25:29] happy
[25:31] even for this wonderful time
[25:34] and uh yes
[25:39] the Lord was gracious we had a service
[25:43] on Friday night service both of us who
[25:46] are taking the service
[25:48] at the end of it all nine people
[25:50] believed in that service
[25:54] and then on Sunday another five or four
[25:57] were added because
[26:51] [Music]
[26:57] we've been through much together
[27:01] the laws and the highs of life
[27:06] he has really shaped my Ministries
[27:13] that's why today we can still meet after
[27:16] over 10 years
[27:19] you know supposed to be the best man in
[27:21] his wedding
[27:24] and that was just one year I think after
[27:26] we met each other
[27:30] and I pushed him to the fire why have
[27:32] you not why have you not uh
[27:36] I asked him why have you noted
[27:39] then he told me I'm going to tell you
[27:41] then after a Shotwell he told me now
[27:44] it's all going to happen
[27:47] but he deliberately chose a day
[27:51] when my firstborn was coming
[28:01] but 22nd of March was my first born
[28:05] [Music]
[28:07] so I don't know if he did deliberately
[28:17] now as the brother said I'm not going to
[28:20] take the service
[28:22] that is one of the reasons I'm very
[28:24] happy
[28:26] amen because I can sit and listen
[28:30] so my work is just to welcome the
[28:32] minister
[28:33] whom the Lord has prepared brother
[28:37] yeah he believed way before me
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] I got confidence that a young man can
[28:58] stand in their message
[28:59] foreign
[29:01] [Music]
[29:29] [Music]
[29:48] I have a good surprise I see brother

[36:44] fathers neither shall any of them that

[36:58] bring into the land where into he went
[37:01] and his seed shall possess it

[38:30] verse 13 to 15.
[38:34] and Joshua blessed him and gave and to
[38:37] call up the son of Jeff name Hebron for
[38:39] an inheritance and Hebron therefore
[38:42] became the inheritance of Caleb's son of
[38:44] jephune the Kelly side and to this day
[38:48] because that he wholly followed the Lord
[38:51] God of Israel and the name of Hebron
[38:54] before was kijaba which Abba was a great
[38:58] man among the anakims the land had rest
[39:02] from war Yeshua is yes
[39:41] Hallelujah
[39:43] once again I greet you in the name of
[39:45] the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:48] it's my first time to preach
[39:52] ERS
[39:59] but I believe God according to his plan
[40:02] before the foundation of the world
[40:07] he preplanned about this day
[40:11] foreign
[40:28] [Music]
[40:46] some people say that that name is
[41:00] [Music]
[41:12] greetings from Nairobi because we were
[41:14] not sure if we were going to preach
[41:27] we have to use the shortest time
[41:29] possible
[41:32] I want to use a Titan call it
[41:37] Guided by the supersense
[41:40] [Music]
[41:42] to possess our god-given inheritance
[41:53] my inspiration is coming from the
[41:55] message
[41:59] that was preached by the prophet in
[42:02] 1959.
[42:09] it should be evening yeah
[42:12] he says
[42:14] God gave those senses but they are given
[42:17] you as a gift
[42:22] and it depends on how you what you yield
[42:26] you yield this sense is true
[42:29] [Music]
[42:35] will be the way that your wife your life
[42:39] is controlled
[42:45] [Applause]
[43:13] [Music]
[43:18] was these five senses given
[43:22] foreign
[43:31] they were not given to guide you they
[43:33] were away
[43:38] but there was given you the sixth sense
[43:44] and that sixth sense
[43:47] it belongs to only the Christian
[43:52] you and you cannot have this Sixth Sense
[43:55] until you become a Christian
[44:01] is the only way that you can ever have
[44:04] any more than five natural senses
[44:19] this is where I got my title
[44:23] but the Sixth Sense is better known to
[44:25] the Christian as faith
[44:31] is the one that governs and guides you
[44:38] and it is superior to all the other
[44:41] senses
[44:50] it's Superior to all the senses
[44:54] [Music]
[44:55] the other five senses
[45:06] super sense is the holy spirit
[45:11] Faith Of God that dwells in you
[45:16] Hallelujah you will wonder why we read
[45:20] from the scripture from the book of uh
[45:22] numbers
[45:28] and in the Book of Joshua
[45:31] to her and you you wonder what's the
[45:33] connection here
[45:35] remember the prophet said he was a
[45:37] typologist
[45:40] [Music]
[45:42] I love typology
[45:45] it makes the Bible reality
[45:49] [Applause]
[45:50] and the prophet told us
[45:53] [Music]
[45:54] that if he had time
[45:58] he could have preached even since from
[46:00] Genesis
[46:05] because the message
[46:08] is the key that opens the Bible
[46:11] we no longer read the Bible as
[46:13] denominations
[46:15] the Bible became the new a new
[46:18] books
[46:20] it is The Book of Life
[46:23] when we read it you see Jesus Christ
[46:28] you see yourself wherever
[46:40] and don't see yourself
[46:44] foreign
[47:08] [Laughter]
[47:28] [Applause]
[47:33] [Music]
[47:48] [Applause]
[48:28] she brought forth a generation of
[48:31] bastards everybody
[48:42] that's why you need to be born again
[48:47] Hallelujah
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:58] [Music]
[49:18] [Music]
[49:47] man he was just an introducer of you to
[49:50] Jesus yes
[49:54] yes you can sail I came again
[50:00] when I realized when I discover
[50:19] he's a descendant of Esau
[50:25] he's found in Israel yes
[50:29] because there is a Gentiles could get
[50:33] into Israel through laws of redemption
[50:35] is
[50:40] [Applause]
[50:45] someone in Leviticus
[50:48] hallelujah praise be to Jesus and we see
[50:52] God had commanded Moses
[50:56] to send them spies
[51:02] [Music]
[51:04] get things but I want you to realize
[51:07] something here
[51:09] God had a plan
[51:11] it's not that God didn't know
[51:17] that he told Moses to send uh 12th wife
[51:22] [Music]
[51:25] Israel had come from
[51:28] because the land that God had given to
[51:31] Abraham Isaac and Jacobs
[51:34] [Applause]
[51:36] it is
[51:39] not another Holy Ghost it is the same
[51:42] holy
[51:43] ghosts
