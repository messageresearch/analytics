[1:21:59] he
[1:22:00] pays and yesterday I was giving an
[1:22:03] example to my young
[1:22:05] people at home um I I've spent uh about
[1:22:11] two two three
[1:22:14] weeks
[1:22:17] with with my bag the one I used to put
[1:22:21] in my iPad my Bible and my laptop the B
[1:22:24] I put my laptop and all other things and
[1:22:27] it it is a good leather
[1:22:31] bag but it disappointed me because it
[1:22:35] broke we put on another zip it also
[1:22:38] broke and so I I I was fed up now I said
[1:22:44] I don't even have the money because all
[1:22:45] the money have been given to the land
[1:22:49] fund I'm spending it on others that I
[1:22:52] thought needed it more than I did
[1:22:57] and so I could
[1:22:59] not I I could not prioritize buying that
[1:23:06] bag language I could not
[1:23:10] afford to buy that bag to buy another
[1:23:13] good nice
[1:23:14] bag and
[1:23:16] so uh yesterday we were invited by a
[1:23:22] sister uh they were celebrating their 20
[1:23:25] years
[1:23:28] anniversary and they invited U my myself
[1:23:32] and my
[1:23:33] family to go and be a part of it because
[1:23:35] their children have been coming to our
[1:23:37] youth
[1:23:39] meetings and so they thought we should
[1:23:42] also
[1:23:43] go somehow we've been a part of their
[1:23:47] family and while
[1:23:49] there I was
[1:23:51] surprised when the sister stood up to
[1:23:53] appreciate
[1:23:56] people with her husband so she stood up
[1:24:00] and I'm taking a moment to give this
[1:24:03] testimony because I believe it will be a
[1:24:05] blessing to
[1:24:07] someone and she said there is someone
[1:24:09] else she called a
[1:24:11] pastor another Pastor other family
[1:24:15] people father and then she said there's
[1:24:18] another person I'd like to
[1:24:20] call he called him he's the pastor of
[1:24:22] all young people in
[1:24:25] and he is he's been doing these youth
[1:24:28] meetings and they have been a blessing
[1:24:30] to our
[1:24:32] children and she said that we should do
[1:24:35] you do them twice a
[1:24:38] week and she said we can't wait for
[1:24:41] January said but there is a
[1:24:45] token of
[1:24:47] appreciation that I would like to and
[1:24:50] theyve been a blessing to our
[1:24:52] children and she's said that we should
[1:24:55] do you do them twice a week
[1:24:59] year and she said we can't wait for
[1:25:02] January and said but there is a
[1:25:06] token of
[1:25:08] appreciation that I would like to give
[1:25:11] and so if you could please come past so
[1:25:14] I went with my
[1:25:15] wife we picked it we a few words we went
[1:25:20] back to our seat so when I arrived home
[1:25:23] is when I checked
[1:25:25] and I found inside there was a little
[1:25:31] not saying the same word she had
[1:25:34] said and I found a
[1:25:37] bag a laptop
[1:25:40] bag exactly what I
[1:25:44] needed I gave my money to the church
[1:25:46] land
[1:25:48] fund how could they think about giving
[1:25:51] me a laptop back of all things
[1:25:56] I was like is it a school
[1:25:58] bag and then I realized it is a
[1:26:01] laptop and a very nice one which I can
[1:26:05] carry so friends God is concerned even
[1:26:08] about the small
[1:26:10] things and if you serve him he sees
[1:26:13] where you have need and he
[1:26:16] provides so should men and women of
[1:26:20] Faith don't lose your
[1:26:23] hope if things are not working for you
[1:26:25] keep giving to the land
[1:26:27] fun to the land fund keep giving you
[1:26:31] will see God opening your
[1:26:34] doors amen there's a sister who called
[1:26:37] me this
[1:26:38] week she said I've been collecting money
[1:26:41] for he said I've been collecting money
[1:26:42] for
[1:26:44] something and it's the money is not is
[1:26:48] not becoming
[1:26:50] enough and I've been doing it for
[1:26:53] years said God has dealt with
[1:26:56] me I resisted I resisted I resisted
[1:26:59] until Pastor now I'm calling you because
[1:27:02] I have decided to
[1:27:03] submit to what the Lord is telling me in
[1:27:06] my heart to
[1:27:07] do and she's just a young sister but she
[1:27:10] gave 550,000
[1:27:14] just this week to the land
[1:27:18] fund now I want you to tell me how can
[1:27:22] God not bless such a person
[1:27:26] God would be a
[1:27:27] liar and he cannot be a
[1:27:30] liar if you serve him if you
[1:27:34] sacrifice I mean it's a
[1:27:36] sacrifice none of us here those of you
[1:27:38] who are
[1:27:39] giving can say that you are giving
[1:27:41] because you have too
[1:27:43] much who is giving because they have too
[1:27:48] much none of us it's a
[1:27:51] sacrifice let us keep sacrificing
[1:27:55] because it is a noble
[1:27:57] cause I understand there are people who
[1:28:00] have been also sending pledges to the
[1:28:01] team leaders and then they do not
[1:28:03] fulfill
[1:28:06] them and the team leaders
[1:28:10] announce and then they realize that they
[1:28:12] the I mean the chairman here announces
[1:28:16] and then he realiz the team leaders
[1:28:17] don't have the money
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:26] it goes back again to
[1:28:29] sacrifice you pledge because you want to
[1:28:32] give so fulfill your
[1:28:35] pledge and even do it more than what you
[1:28:39] pledge you need
[1:28:41] something and what you have is not
[1:28:43] enough they say eat that
[1:28:46] money but we say give it to the
[1:28:50] land and God will open doors
[1:28:56] you shout big amen amen amen so we

[1:33:59] 5 chapter 2 verse
[1:34:02] 5 I would like you today to give me your
[1:34:05] undivided attention there is a subject I
[1:34:07] want to deal with a real important
[1:34:13] subject I'm going to be talking about um
[1:34:16] the subject will be basting in his
[1:34:22] work and
[1:34:24] that the
[1:34:25] subject but I'm going to be talking
[1:34:28] about Works Faith
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:33] Grace and many times we
[1:34:36] confuse thinking that what we do is what
[1:34:40] makes us makes God love
[1:34:44] us we think that what we do is going to
[1:34:47] take us to
[1:34:49] heaven and sometimes we think it is very
[1:34:52] important
[1:34:55] to the extent that we don't even think
[1:34:57] ever think about faith and
[1:35:01] Grace and others they think that what
[1:35:03] they do does not matter at
[1:35:07] all they can live like the rest of the
[1:35:10] world but today I want us to delve into
[1:35:13] that
[1:35:14] subject and may God give us
[1:35:19] Grace we reading from vers five
[1:35:25] God bless you musicians that's the
[1:35:27] singing we will
[1:35:30] do even when we were dead in sins has he
[1:35:35] even when we were dead in sins has
[1:35:37] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:35:40] grace are ye
[1:35:41] saved and has raised us up together and
[1:35:44] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[1:35:47] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[1:35:51] he might show the exceeding Riches of of
[1:35:53] his grace in his kindness toward us
[1:35:56] through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye
[1:35:58] saved through faith and that not of
[1:36:00] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[1:36:04] Works lest any man should boast for we
[1:36:06] are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:36:10] Jesus uh unto good works which God has
[1:36:13] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:36:15] them wherefore remember that ye being in
[1:36:18] time past Gentiles in flesh in the flesh
[1:36:22] who are called un circumcision by that
[1:36:25] which is called a circumcision in the
[1:36:26] flesh made by
[1:36:28] hands that at that time you were without
[1:36:32] Christ being aliens from the
[1:36:34] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:36:37] from the covenants of Promise having no
[1:36:39] hope and without God in the world the
[1:36:42] last verse we shall read verse 13 but
[1:36:44] now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
[1:36:48] were far off are made near by the blood
[1:36:52] of Christ
[1:36:56] we'll just pray first and then you'll
[1:36:57] read when we we are seated let us pray

[1:37:02] portion of scripture we have read

[1:37:20] inspiration

[1:37:27] way I am totally nothing Lord in
[1:37:30] myself I realize that I'm a sinner only

[1:37:35] help me and my brother here Lord

[1:40:08] Spirit lead but as much might preach I
[1:40:10] want to
[1:40:11] teach amen are we
[1:40:14] following please let us be sober and
[1:40:18] follow because as much as I might I
[1:40:20] don't know I don't know how the Holy
[1:40:22] Spirit lead but as much as I might
[1:40:23] preach I want to
[1:40:27] teach and so please give me your
[1:40:30] undivided
[1:40:32] attention so that we can learn the word
[1:40:34] of God
[1:40:37] together
[1:40:39] Amen Let us also read
[1:40:45] Galatians chapter
[1:40:49] 6 verse
[1:40:52] 14 for God forbid that I should Glory
[1:40:55] serving the cross of our Lord Jesus
[1:40:57] Christ by whom the world is crucified
[1:41:00] unto me and I unto the
[1:41:18] world now how many here are believers
[1:41:23] if you believe in in the message you
[1:41:26] believe in Jesus
[1:41:30] Christ did you notice that some people
[1:41:32] are not
[1:41:35] sure how many here
[1:41:38] Believers okay now I see I have many
[1:41:41] Believers because they say they are
[1:41:44] believers what if somebody asks you what
[1:41:47] do you boast
[1:41:51] in what makes you feel you are
[1:41:55] special many times we have said even
[1:41:57] while we are preaching that we are a
[1:41:59] special
[1:42:03] people are we special because we claim
[1:42:05] that we are
[1:42:09] believers or are we special because we
[1:42:12] do things
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:15] different what makes us
[1:42:18] special what makes us
[1:42:21] boss where is our
[1:42:25] boasting so I want you to pay
[1:42:29] attention and may God make this real to
[1:42:32] us
[1:42:34] today now I'd like us to see here that
[1:42:37] God created Man In His
[1:42:40] Image but in the
[1:42:43] beginning man fell from this
[1:42:46] place because man was the perfect image
[1:42:49] of
[1:42:51] God and God is a perfect
[1:42:55] God he's a God who was not a sinner of
[1:42:59] course and a God who could not
[1:43:02] sin and so man was also in the same way
[1:43:05] perfect he was like God he was not a
[1:43:08] sinner and he could not
[1:43:14] sin he was created in the image and in
[1:43:17] the likeness of
[1:43:19] God so when we talk about man being
[1:43:22] created and F in the image of
[1:43:25] God we are not really talking about this
[1:43:29] flesh this is not what we're talking
[1:43:32] about if you go back to Genesis chapter
[1:43:35] 1 the Bible
[1:43:37] explains male and female created he
[1:43:41] them so but you could not see
[1:43:44] them it was in chapter two that he went
[1:43:48] and now molded man out of the ground
[1:43:53] and then breathed into his nostr the
[1:43:55] breath of
[1:43:57] life and Man became a living
[1:43:59] Soul so in other words man was already
[1:44:02] created before he was
[1:44:06] formed how many understand that he was
[1:44:09] created already before he was form and
[1:44:13] Hallelujah and that man who was
[1:44:16] created was the man in the image of
[1:44:19] God not this one here all right but now
[1:44:23] we
[1:44:24] see that something happened when man was
[1:44:29] formed and Man became a living
[1:44:32] Soul you know he now fell from the place
[1:44:36] where God had placed
[1:44:39] him
[1:44:41] he man of course I'm trying my thoughts
[1:44:44] are running here and there trying to see
[1:44:45] a lot of
[1:44:47] things and I'm trying to yield to the
[1:44:49] Holy Spirit to see where which direction
[1:44:50] to
[1:44:52] take you know when when you're listening
[1:44:54] and you going to the
[1:44:56] word the word is very rich and there are
[1:44:59] many roads you can
[1:45:01] take you can drive your faith will drive
[1:45:04] me
[1:45:06] today which direction I will take so
[1:45:09] don't wor you can say Amen from to time
[1:45:13] so we see that man at the beginning he
[1:45:17] fell from that
[1:45:18] place now no matter what man did after
[1:45:22] the fall
[1:45:25] no matter what he in
[1:45:28] himself what he could
[1:45:30] do nothing could restore him to his
[1:45:34] original
[1:45:36] place so man could was
[1:45:40] Fallen nothing to restore him the
[1:45:44] relationship was
[1:45:45] gone and man was eternally separated
[1:45:49] from God
[1:45:53] tell someone death is
[1:45:56] separation so man died in the face of
[1:45:59] God man could no longer be in
[1:46:01] relationship with the
[1:46:05] father nothing you could do that could
[1:46:08] save and in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:46:13] 18:4 the scripture says behold All Souls
[1:46:16] are
[1:46:17] mine as the soul of the
[1:46:20] father so also the soul of the son is
[1:46:24] the soul that
[1:46:26] sinth it shall
[1:46:29] die so man as a living
[1:46:32] Soul he sinned and he fell from
[1:46:36] Grace let me not use what that word yet
[1:46:40] he fell from his
[1:46:41] place he fell from the place of
[1:46:45] perfection are you following he fell
[1:46:48] from the place of
[1:46:50] perfection and Man became insuff
[1:46:55] now listen from that
[1:46:58] moment anyone that was born out of that
[1:47:04] lineage was born a
[1:47:09] sinner and I will stop right there for a
[1:47:12] moment and I will say this did you know
[1:47:16] that whatever your father
[1:47:19] did and he did not overcome
[1:47:23] it was passed down onto
[1:47:26] you many times we fight against
[1:47:29] things we fight against feeling we fight
[1:47:32] against spirits but you find down the
[1:47:38] line the thing came from behind
[1:47:43] there what your father never
[1:47:46] overcame if your father did not overcome
[1:47:50] adultery imal living
[1:47:53] you find all through your
[1:47:55] family that thing is following
[1:47:58] you you find that it's the same demons
[1:48:01] that come and begin to press on
[1:48:04] you if there was if your father was a
[1:48:08] good
[1:48:09] liar you will find that you also you
[1:48:12] somehow become a good
[1:48:14] Li if your father was a very angry
[1:48:17] man you also find you are a very angry
[1:48:21] man some of you are seed here and
[1:48:24] behaving as if you don't know what I'm
[1:48:25] talking
[1:48:26] about but I know you are understanding
[1:48:29] it because you are struggling with
[1:48:31] things that your fathers did not
[1:48:34] overcome and that is why it is very
[1:48:38] important for us as Believers to
[1:48:41] overcome these
[1:48:42] things because if we cannot overcome
[1:48:45] them then it will be passed on down to
[1:48:48] our
[1:48:49] generation so you see we are people who
[1:48:53] now should realize who we were before we
[1:48:55] came into the
[1:48:58] world our genealogy should go beyond our
[1:49:02] natural
[1:49:06] fathers because you cannot be able to
[1:49:10] understand you know if I tell you that
[1:49:13] you are not supposed to be a
[1:49:16] sinner when your body is telling you
[1:49:18] otherwise how can you be able to
[1:49:21] understand but let me tell you
[1:49:23] that you had a life before this life and
[1:49:28] that life is a real life is is the life
[1:49:32] before the
[1:49:34] fall and whoever was a seed of
[1:49:37] God was there in the mind of
[1:49:40] God before the fall but now after the
[1:49:45] fall we were all born according to the
[1:49:48] last of the
[1:49:51] flesh according into the natural birth
[1:49:54] of of our
[1:49:56] fathers and that is after
[1:50:00] Adam that is after Adam you understand
[1:50:04] Abra Adam God gave birth to the first
[1:50:09] child and the first child was born under
[1:50:14] perversion he was born in sin he was
[1:50:17] born
[1:50:19] defeated and his son gave birth to his
[1:50:22] to another
[1:50:23] son and his son gave birth to another
[1:50:25] son now it doesn't matter which race we
[1:50:28] are
[1:50:29] from we are really all from
[1:50:32] Adam can I have more sound brother my
[1:50:35] voice was a bit affected so we notice
[1:50:38] here that we are all from One
[1:50:41] race and that is the human
[1:50:44] race and sister fortunate the whole
[1:50:47] human
[1:50:48] race is a sinful race
[1:50:53] there is no one that is Holy why not
[1:50:59] because they have done good or
[1:51:01] bad but because they are born in
[1:51:08] sin you didn't get it we are
[1:51:12] sinners not because we
[1:51:16] sin but because we were born in a nature
[1:51:20] that is
[1:51:23] all the children of
[1:51:25] Adam which we are we were born
[1:51:29] Fallen we were born like him fallen from
[1:51:34] our original
[1:51:36] position but if you were are sons of
[1:51:39] God there is a jam of Life somewhere in
[1:51:43] us which keeps calling to that other
[1:51:47] life that's why when we hear the
[1:51:50] word we respond to that
[1:51:54] now let us look at this a little more
[1:51:57] now so the soul that sins that Soul
[1:52:00] shall
[1:52:01] die that was from the mouth of
[1:52:04] God what death is he talking
[1:52:07] about death is
[1:52:10] separation so when he says the soul that
[1:52:13] sins it shall die is meaning it will be
[1:52:17] eternally separated from
[1:52:21] God all right I want you to look at
[1:52:23] Genesis chapter
[1:52:25] 2 ver 16 all right I told you we shall
[1:52:29] have a little study this
[1:52:30] morning so I would like us to take our
[1:52:33] time and go through the
[1:52:35] scriptures and the Lord God formed the
[1:52:38] man saying of every tree now this is
[1:52:40] Genesis 2 of every tree of the garden
[1:52:43] thou mayest freely eat but of the tree
[1:52:46] of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou
[1:52:48] shal not eat of it for in the day that
[1:52:50] thou eatest thereof thou shall surely
[1:52:53] die Genesis 2:16 and
[1:53:09] 17 Genesis 25 16 16
[1:53:29] all right are you following me I need
[1:53:32] your
[1:53:33] amens yes yes keep them coming so we can
[1:53:37] move deeper into the
[1:53:39] scrip all right so now we we notice here
[1:53:43] that now God now in the
[1:53:47] beginning when he had formed man he
[1:53:50] created man and then he formed him after
[1:53:54] he formed him out of the Dust of the
[1:53:57] ground and Man became a living Soul he
[1:54:00] told him of every
[1:54:02] tree you can eat but there is one tree
[1:54:07] which you cannot
[1:54:08] eat and that's the tree of
[1:54:11] knowledge of Good and Evil let me first
[1:54:14] talk about that in a
[1:54:15] moment there were three categories of
[1:54:18] trees in the
[1:54:20] garden there are the first category was
[1:54:24] the was the trees that were good for
[1:54:28] food like for example like what
[1:54:33] mangoes PE apples come on keep them
[1:54:39] coming jul I don't know how they call
[1:54:41] jambul in
[1:54:43] English jack fruit and all these so
[1:54:47] those were trees in the
[1:54:48] garden and they were good for food but
[1:54:52] now
[1:54:54] there was this other
[1:54:58] category of these trees now these ones
[1:55:01] they were in the middle of the
[1:55:04] garden now these were not physical
[1:55:09] trees this this was just Bible
[1:55:14] language but it is meaning something
[1:55:18] else the first category the first
[1:55:20] category in ones of the the ones which
[1:55:23] were in the
[1:55:25] middle it was the tree of
[1:55:28] life now the tree of life was not a
[1:55:32] physical
[1:55:34] tree this word tree here it is a symbol
[1:55:39] it means
[1:55:41] person God always in the Bible in in
[1:55:44] Bible language always God uses the word
[1:55:46] tree to mean
[1:55:50] person or to mean man
[1:55:53] for example you remember in the Book of
[1:55:55] Psalms when I mentioned these verses
[1:55:58] Brothers you should pull it
[1:55:59] up Psalms chapter 1 the Bible talks
[1:56:03] about a man it says blessed is the man
[1:56:07] who walks not in the councel of the
[1:56:10] ungod how many remember that and then he
[1:56:14] continues on to say but you know he
[1:56:16] meditates in the law of God both day and
[1:56:19] night he says he shall be like a
[1:56:23] what like a
[1:56:25] tree now the ones who are not who don't
[1:56:27] read bibles are
[1:56:29] wondering where is that one coming from
[1:56:32] how many love the Bible amen you should
[1:56:34] read the Bible he shall be like a what
[1:56:38] like a tree brother Marin there some
[1:56:40] people who don't read the Bible they're
[1:56:41] waiting for you to
[1:56:43] put they shall be like a he shall be
[1:56:46] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:56:50] water amen now is referring to a
[1:56:54] man who walks not after the C of the
[1:56:57] ungodly he says he is like a
[1:57:00] tree and we know that also in other
[1:57:03] parts of
[1:57:04] scripture he refers to Israel as
[1:57:08] trees aloy trees he refers to Christ as
[1:57:12] a to Israel as fig
[1:57:15] trees and then he refers to Christ as an
[1:57:18] olive
[1:57:19] tree and how the Israel they are the
[1:57:23] branches Romans 11 so in other words we
[1:57:27] see all through scripture that the word
[1:57:30] tree means a
[1:57:32] person and so who is the Tree of Life in
[1:57:36] The Book of Revelation he says to him
[1:57:38] that
[1:57:40] overcometh I will give to him to eat of
[1:57:43] the tree of
[1:57:44] life so how will they eat the Tree of
[1:57:48] Life this tree of life is not eaten like
[1:57:51] you eat aus
[1:57:54] no how do you eat of it you eat of it by
[1:57:58] hearing and
[1:58:00] believing because this tree is not a
[1:58:02] physical
[1:58:03] tree this tree is a
[1:58:06] man this tree is a
[1:58:09] person and and he came here on Earth and
[1:58:13] he declared
[1:58:14] himself when he walked in the streets of
[1:58:17] Jerusalem and he said I am the
[1:58:20] way I am the
[1:58:22] truth I am the
[1:58:26] life no man come to the father but by me
[1:58:30] now Jesus declared he was the tree of
[1:58:35] life so he's the man of life so it's the
[1:58:39] tree which was in the middle of the
[1:58:42] Garden in Genesis that Adam and Eve were
[1:58:46] eating
[1:58:47] from how the Bible says he came every
[1:58:50] evening
[1:58:53] he came every evening and they would eat
[1:58:55] from him and they would eat from him and
[1:58:58] they would eat from him they could never
[1:59:01] die they were Eternal they were perfect
[1:59:05] they were sinless as long as they were
[1:59:07] eating from the Tree of
[1:59:10] Life Hallelujah but that was before the
[1:59:14] fall and then he said but the man that
[1:59:17] shall
[1:59:18] see that man
[1:59:20] shall die
[1:59:22] meaning that man will be separated from
[1:59:27] me
[1:59:29] forever all right so now in Genesis he
[1:59:34] now tells them what will kill
[1:59:38] them he says you can eat of all the
[1:59:42] trees you can eat the Trees of the trees
[1:59:44] good for
[1:59:45] food you can also eat of the Tree of
[1:59:49] Life which I am the one but but there is
[1:59:53] one tree which they were
[1:59:57] forbidden to eat over and that was the
[2:00:00] tree of
[2:00:02] knowledge of Good and Evil what was that
[2:00:06] tree if the tree of life was a
[2:00:10] man the person of
[2:00:12] Life the tree of
[2:00:15] knowledge was also a person a person it
[2:00:20] was not a physical tree oh my I wish I
[2:00:22] had the
[2:00:23] time but I'll just rehearse it and I
[2:00:27] will not go into the scriptures to read
[2:00:29] because we need to finish what the
[2:00:31] thought I have for so when you go to the
[2:00:33] Book of
[2:00:34] Ezekiel in chapter
[2:00:37] 28 how many are following in the Book of
[2:00:40] Ezekiel
[2:00:41] 28 he talks
[2:00:43] about the the the king of
[2:00:47] TI tius I think and he says that this
[2:00:53] was
[2:00:54] perfect was perfect until evil was found
[2:00:59] in
[2:01:00] him the Bible says he was
[2:01:04] created but then again the Bible says he
[2:01:07] was an
[2:01:09] angel that
[2:01:11] covered who was he he was an angel in
[2:01:15] heaven and in the book of Isaiah he
[2:01:19] talks about what his name was says his
[2:01:22] name was
[2:01:23] Lucifer now that Lucifer what did he do
[2:01:27] in the Book of Revelation he speaks
[2:01:30] about him when he says there was war in
[2:01:33] heaven and and the
[2:01:36] dragon fought and his
[2:01:39] angels and and he says who was that
[2:01:43] dragon that Dragon was
[2:01:46] Satan that old
[2:01:49] Ser he calls him that
[2:01:54] the
[2:01:55] dragon he was Lucifer as an angel but
[2:01:59] when as the Bible describes in the book
[2:02:00] of Isaiah he lifted
[2:02:03] himself and he wanted to be above the
[2:02:06] stars of
[2:02:07] God and he was so
[2:02:09] proud of how beautiful he was the Bible
[2:02:13] in the Book of Ezekiel speaks of his
[2:02:18] pipes his voices he was a good singer
[2:02:22] he was an angel in heaven not just an
[2:02:25] angel he was the angel that
[2:02:28] cover the angel that cover means he was
[2:02:32] the one that had more than two
[2:02:35] Wings he was always around the presence
[2:02:38] of
[2:02:39] God he was not just any normal
[2:02:42] Angel he was one of the captains among
[2:02:45] the angels of
[2:02:47] God and so when he fell he did not fall
[2:02:51] alone he F he was able to convince many
[2:02:54] angels in
[2:02:56] heaven to agree with him that he can
[2:02:59] actually take the Throne of
[2:03:02] God that's why if you want to know that
[2:03:05] the devil is in
[2:03:07] someone they will be very
[2:03:10] proud that's why the Bible says Pride
[2:03:12] precedes a
[2:03:14] fall you have to be
[2:03:16] humble the Way Up Is Down and the way
[2:03:20] down is up if you want to be anything in
[2:03:24] life humble
[2:03:26] yourself we hear so much about a super
[2:03:31] rest some people they think their tribes
[2:03:33] are higher than
[2:03:35] others we are all seeing by
[2:03:39] gra there is no tribe that is
[2:03:42] special only
[2:03:44] Israel only Israel and we the Christians
[2:03:48] are the spiritual Israel
[2:03:52] all right so we see that this angel fell
[2:03:57] from heaven the B says and when they
[2:04:01] fought Michael fought with the
[2:04:04] dragon and and Michael defeated the
[2:04:07] dragon and the dragon his place was no
[2:04:10] longer fall
[2:04:11] in and he was cast
[2:04:14] out out of heaven and where did he go he
[2:04:19] came down to the Earth
[2:04:21] and in the book of of Ezekiel
[2:04:24] 28 he tells us where exactly he
[2:04:29] went he says Thou was in heaven give me
[2:04:32] the scripture Brother come on you were
[2:04:35] in
[2:04:35] heaven brother in Eden thou was in Eden
[2:04:40] the Garden of
[2:04:42] God when he was cast out from Heaven he
[2:04:46] went to Eden are you hearing me Satan
[2:04:49] went to Eden
[2:04:51] but where in Eden was
[2:04:54] he because remember Satan is a
[2:04:56] spirit he's not flesh and blood he was a
[2:05:00] spirit like all the others
[2:05:03] Angels They Are Spiritual
[2:05:06] Beings are you following me so far I
[2:05:09] don't want to go so fast so I
[2:05:11] lose keep keep saying amen so we know
[2:05:14] this here that when he went down to Eden
[2:05:18] he had a
[2:05:20] mission when he fa yeah right there when
[2:05:23] he failed in
[2:05:24] heaven he decided to come and try on
[2:05:28] Earth he came down to
[2:05:31] Adam because he knew Adam was the son of
[2:05:36] God and he came down to try down here on
[2:05:40] Earth well that's why the Bible says who
[2:05:45] unto the inhabit of the
[2:05:49] Earth because he came down
[2:05:53] with a a mission to
[2:05:55] defeat Adam and take his
[2:05:59] place so now when he came down into
[2:06:02] Eden he was a
[2:06:04] spirit now people stop
[2:06:07] there and that's why we need a
[2:06:12] prophet that's why we need a
[2:06:15] prophet that's why we need a prophet
[2:06:18] that's why God uses
[2:06:19] prophets because there are sudden
[2:06:22] things other ministers cannot
[2:06:26] understand that theology cannot
[2:06:29] understand and it takes a prophetic
[2:06:33] eye to see in the past and in the
[2:06:37] future to be able to tell you the mind
[2:06:40] of
[2:06:41] God and that's when a prophet came and
[2:06:43] told
[2:06:44] us that when the devil came
[2:06:47] down in the garden of Aiden he went
[2:06:50] straight for the woman
[2:06:53] but how did he do that because he was a
[2:06:55] spirit and and the woman was a body was
[2:06:58] a
[2:07:00] flesh that the devil found one of the
[2:07:05] beasts not just any
[2:07:07] Beast he found the
[2:07:10] best the one which was the
[2:07:14] wisest of all the Beast that the Lord
[2:07:17] God had
[2:07:18] made some people think that God made a
[2:07:20] snake
[2:07:23] God did not create a
[2:07:27] snake it is a snake as a result of a
[2:07:32] cur are you hearing me the Beast that
[2:07:35] the devil went
[2:07:37] to could talk could reason could think
[2:07:43] and
[2:07:44] furthermore that Beast had a
[2:07:48] seed and that seed of all the beasts of
[2:07:52] the
[2:07:53] ground that seed was the only seed which
[2:07:58] could mingle with the human
[2:08:00] race to bring forth a
[2:08:03] child and the devil knew that that's why
[2:08:06] he came to
[2:08:08] this and he did not need
[2:08:10] permission because animals are not free
[2:08:14] moral
[2:08:16] agents you remember when God Amen in
[2:08:19] Jesus Christ he went to that tombs of
[2:08:23] GAD and he found this demon possessed SM
[2:08:27] you know the demons began shouting have
[2:08:30] you come to take us and kill us before
[2:08:32] our
[2:08:33] time and then they
[2:08:36] baded please send us to the
[2:08:39] pig and Jesus did like this and they all
[2:08:43] went to the
[2:08:44] pig now the the pigs were now demon
[2:08:48] possessed now they began running
[2:08:52] shouting with a loud
[2:08:56] sound it was not the big
[2:08:59] shouting it was a demon shouting in the
[2:09:03] pigs and when the when the pigs went in
[2:09:06] the
[2:09:06] water they drowned the pigs died but the
[2:09:11] demons never
[2:09:12] die those demons are here
[2:09:15] today and if you remember those demons
[2:09:19] that made that man naked
[2:09:22] he was no longer dressing but when they
[2:09:25] left him he started dressing so we have
[2:09:28] many people who don't want to dress
[2:09:31] because they demon
[2:09:33] possessed but let me tell you if those
[2:09:35] demons can leave
[2:09:37] them they will amen get
[2:09:39] shame and they will be able to dress up
[2:09:42] they will cover themselves you find
[2:09:45] women
[2:09:46] Min you know they want to you know take
[2:09:49] and cover you know wrong
[2:09:53] Spirit among the young men among the
[2:09:56] young women until the minds of the
[2:09:58] people this
[2:10:00] generation is completely
[2:10:03] rotten why because of what they see oh
[2:10:07] young sister don't let the devil use
[2:10:10] you amen you should be a different
[2:10:14] person but we shall come back to that so
[2:10:18] we find when those demons left and they
[2:10:22] went into the pigs the pigs died but the
[2:10:25] demons are still alive today those
[2:10:27] demons are here in
[2:10:28] Camp those demons are here even
[2:10:31] inong they all over the
[2:10:34] world and they undressing
[2:10:39] women and they have even started
[2:10:41] addressing the
[2:10:46] men all right I will not go into that
[2:10:49] direction let me not go that way I want
[2:10:51] to keep the thought here but I was being
[2:10:54] tempted to go
[2:10:55] there all right
[2:10:58] listen are you following me we find that
[2:11:03] now this these demons did not
[2:11:07] die but they used the
[2:11:10] pigs so the pigs were victims of
[2:11:17] circumstances and by the way those pigs
[2:11:19] died so don't say that pigs have
[2:11:25] demons the pigs that got demon possess
[2:11:27] they
[2:11:29] die so the demons the pigs we have today
[2:11:32] don't have
[2:11:34] demons so you can enjoy a por
[2:11:37] meal it has no demons in it all right so
[2:11:41] we see that you know when these
[2:11:45] demons left the pigs the pigs died you
[2:11:49] would feel sorry for those pigs
[2:11:52] because they were
[2:11:54] victims they were caught in the Cross
[2:11:59] Fire they were just there and then
[2:12:02] demons enter because they did not have
[2:12:05] an authority to
[2:12:06] reject in the same way in the garden of
[2:12:10] aen when that old
[2:12:13] serpent the devil he came down in the
[2:12:16] garden and he found a beast he found a
[2:12:20] beast called
[2:12:25] the Bible calls
[2:12:27] it in lug know
[2:12:32] it but it was a
[2:12:34] beast Hallelujah this Beast
[2:12:39] was like
[2:12:41] me having hands and having legs and
[2:12:46] having a mouth and having eyes and
[2:12:49] having even ears
[2:12:51] and a nose and it could talk and it
[2:12:55] could reason the only thing it did not
[2:12:58] have was a
[2:13:01] SW that is the only difference between
[2:13:03] us and that
[2:13:05] be that one was the only
[2:13:08] spe which was closest to the human
[2:13:13] race and it was living in the garden of
[2:13:17] Ed when the devil came he knew
[2:13:21] this Beast can be able to I can be able
[2:13:26] to borrow the body of this
[2:13:29] beast and then inject my
[2:13:33] seed into the human
[2:13:35] [Music]
[2:13:37] race and this Beast had a
[2:13:41] seed and the devil wanted to borrow that
[2:13:44] seed and teach the human
[2:13:47] rest something
[2:13:49] new ince something
[2:13:53] and that's exactly what happened the
[2:13:55] Beast was just there in the garden and
[2:13:58] then it felt something
[2:14:00] coming what's
[2:14:06] that and then it felt you know when
[2:14:10] demons come in in a
[2:14:12] creature become very
[2:14:15] strong you've seen people who are demon
[2:14:18] possess they're very strong
[2:14:21] if they would punch
[2:14:24] you you may even lose all your
[2:14:27] tooth they start
[2:14:30] walking
[2:14:33] is
[2:14:36] the the Bible did not say it was
[2:14:40] craing you see those things those
[2:14:43] pictures the ones you saw when you were
[2:14:44] a child a snake
[2:14:47] cing and then coming in the tree
[2:14:51] and then the Snak
[2:14:52] speaking did God say if snakes can talk
[2:14:57] why are they no longer talking
[2:15:01] now snakes cannot
[2:15:03] talk that one was a
[2:15:05] beast that image you have in your
[2:15:08] head is not
[2:15:10] bibical remove it right now trash
[2:15:16] it it was a beast that could walk and
[2:15:20] talk
[2:15:22] and when it came down it spoke to Adam
[2:15:25] to e and he said did God
[2:15:30] said you cannot eat of the
[2:15:33] trees if said no God did not God said we
[2:15:37] could
[2:15:38] eat but he said there is one tree we
[2:15:40] cannot eat of is the tree of knowledge
[2:15:44] that one he said we shouldn't even touch
[2:15:45] it now she added on the
[2:15:48] word by saying we should not touch it
[2:15:52] because she was very
[2:15:53] excited and then she added and when she
[2:15:56] added the serpent was
[2:15:59] Happ no you will not die you also took
[2:16:02] away
[2:16:03] from now listen listen
[2:16:07] carefully that
[2:16:09] serpent the Bible says beg the
[2:16:14] woman how many are 18 years and above
[2:16:17] you you know what the word beg is
[2:16:22] when you beg
[2:16:25] somebody you are enticing
[2:16:28] them to accept what you are
[2:16:33] saying so that you can do something with
[2:16:37] them are you following me that's what
[2:16:40] the Bible says the serpent beg the
[2:16:44] woman and the woman was
[2:16:47] convinced now the Bible stops there and
[2:16:49] it simply says she
[2:16:52] at all right now if you don't understand
[2:16:56] that's Bible
[2:16:57] language but what is the
[2:16:59] eating remember this the tree of
[2:17:02] knowledge do we know do you know right
[2:17:04] now you are
[2:17:06] eating do you know you eating you eat by
[2:17:10] hearing and accepting so the
[2:17:13] woman by hearing and accepting what the
[2:17:17] serent said
[2:17:22] but
[2:17:23] remember this eating when she was
[2:17:27] convinced when she accepted she took of
[2:17:30] the fruit of
[2:17:31] the and of it so there was an action
[2:17:38] in and later on we find out later on
[2:17:44] that when Adam comes the Bible says she
[2:17:47] also introduced to the
[2:17:49] man and together with her they did it
[2:17:54] and that was the
[2:17:57] original what was it now now now this is
[2:18:01] very don't don't miss this one don't
[2:18:04] miss this one what was the
[2:18:08] original the
[2:18:10] original happened between The Serpent
[2:18:12] and the
[2:18:16] woman are you following
[2:18:20] it did not happen between Adam
[2:18:24] and it was between The
[2:18:27] Serpent and the
[2:18:29] woman first
[2:18:31] Timothy chter 2 it is just right in
[2:18:35] there I want you to look at
[2:18:38] it quickly
[2:18:41] now I wish you had given me the verse
[2:18:44] here I would just
[2:18:49] Contin all right right what does it
[2:18:55] say verse 14 Adam was not
[2:19:00] deceived everybody say that verse
[2:19:05] Adam do we believe this to be the word
[2:19:08] of
[2:19:09] God Adam was not
[2:19:12] deceived but the woman being
[2:19:15] deceived was in the
[2:19:19] transgression so what did she do she
[2:19:22] committed
[2:19:24] adultery it was a sin of
[2:19:27] adultery but remember sin was already
[2:19:31] done before even had
[2:19:34] doubted what is the sin sin was
[2:19:38] unbelief the moment she believed the
[2:19:41] serpent she had unbelieved
[2:19:44] God and she had sinned and she was a
[2:19:48] separ from
[2:19:50] and this
[2:19:53] adultery was only the
[2:19:56] fruit of the
[2:19:59] tree it was the
[2:20:01] outcome because you reject the
[2:20:04] word you tell the lie because you reject
[2:20:07] the word you go and do wrong
[2:20:10] actions but the sin is
[2:20:13] unbelief and that's what happened and
[2:20:16] then
[2:20:17] adultery came as a result
[2:20:20] and the serpent injected his
[2:20:24] seed into the womb of the
[2:20:28] woman and he brought forth
[2:20:32] Cain was not a son of
[2:20:35] Adam
[2:20:39] never the Bible proves it I only don't
[2:20:42] have the time today but if you ask me in
[2:20:44] a youth meeting I'll give you the verses
[2:20:48] listen we find out all
[2:20:53] that when when Cain came into the
[2:20:56] world he was of another
[2:20:59] nature his nature was not the nature of
[2:21:04] Adam his nature was the nature of the
[2:21:08] serpent now now now listen when the
[2:21:11] serpent used when the devil used the
[2:21:14] serpent he came
[2:21:17] out and and and and Adam he
[2:21:21] himself together with his wife after
[2:21:24] both of them had
[2:21:26] SE now when God comes down he asks
[2:21:32] Adam where are you he says I'm hiding
[2:21:36] here because I'm naked said who told you
[2:21:39] you are naked he said have you eaten of
[2:21:43] the tree have you taken the fruit of the
[2:21:47] tree that I told you not to eat
[2:21:50] was the tree of knowledge the tree of
[2:21:53] knowledge was
[2:21:56] Satan he has both good and
[2:21:59] evil in
[2:22:02] him praise
[2:22:05] God praise
[2:22:07] God and we notice Adam says yes I have
[2:22:12] done
[2:22:13] it and then he
[2:22:17] adds but it was the woman
[2:22:21] it was the woman you gave me she's the
[2:22:24] one who introduced this thing to
[2:22:26] me God said all right woman why have you
[2:22:31] done
[2:22:32] this God Papa God it is also not me it
[2:22:38] was the
[2:22:39] Ser who beged me he enticed me
[2:22:45] until I
[2:22:48] accepted and God said
[2:22:51] that's what you have done because you
[2:22:53] have done
[2:22:54] this you are going to suffer whenever
[2:22:58] you are giving back to these children
[2:23:00] who are in
[2:23:05] your you have to read the Bible with
[2:23:09] understanding and until today there is
[2:23:11] pain and
[2:23:13] suffering when women are giving back
[2:23:16] even when they
[2:23:17] Believers because that was added
[2:23:20] because of the law it was added
[2:23:24] because they accepted to give birth this
[2:23:28] way not in the will of God it's a
[2:23:32] permissive
[2:23:35] will and that's why it has pain on
[2:23:38] it but God promised the Believers those
[2:23:41] who
[2:23:42] believe he will save them in that
[2:23:45] per and give them
[2:23:47] salvation out of that that child back
[2:23:52] meaning they will be saved they not die
[2:23:55] they will not die when giving birth they
[2:23:57] will not lose their children they will
[2:23:59] not die why it is the grace of God all
[2:24:03] right now follow me closely here now the
[2:24:05] woman she
[2:24:07] was that transgression that thing was
[2:24:10] added upon
[2:24:12] her because of the sin to the man he
[2:24:16] said
[2:24:17] you because you have done
[2:24:19] this from
[2:24:21] today you are going to suffer you are
[2:24:25] going to T the ground and you will
[2:24:28] sweat you will work that's why I
[2:24:32] believe it is the duty of a man to work
[2:24:35] and sweat for his
[2:24:38] family it is not your wife's duty to
[2:24:41] work for
[2:24:44] you can I have the man shouting a
[2:24:47] man listen listen I am not preaching to
[2:24:50] you what you want to
[2:24:52] hear I am telling you what the Bible
[2:24:54] says so you will excuse me if you don't
[2:24:57] like what I'm
[2:24:58] saying it is a man's duty to
[2:25:01] work to sweat to labor and provide for
[2:25:06] his wife and
[2:25:08] children if he can't do it the Bible
[2:25:11] says is even worse than
[2:25:14] unid
[2:25:18] infid yes
[2:25:20] it is not a duty of a
[2:25:24] woman to go out there and labor and
[2:25:28] suffer and provide for his house for her
[2:25:31] house no it is a man's
[2:25:35] responsibility and that is why if your
[2:25:39] wife doesn't have to work you don't have
[2:25:41] to force
[2:25:44] her but these days it is no longer men
[2:25:47] forcing women to work
[2:25:50] women who have refused their
[2:25:53] position and their place in the home in
[2:25:55] the
[2:25:58] family may God give us more women with a
[2:26:02] backbone to raise their
[2:26:05] children to raise their
[2:26:07] family in the fear of God the reason why
[2:26:11] we have amen child deliquency
[2:26:14] is because we have parent
[2:26:18] delen parents are no longer
[2:26:21] parents children are raising
[2:26:24] themselves they don't have a father they
[2:26:26] don't have a mother and that's why their
[2:26:29] eyes are all
[2:26:30] out doing everything they want to do
[2:26:34] because they are not
[2:26:35] raised you need to understand a child
[2:26:38] must be
[2:26:40] raised by a parent who is God
[2:26:44] Called to be a mother or a father is a
[2:26:48] calling
[2:26:50] Hallelujah but they have rejected it why
[2:26:53] because they
[2:26:55] rebellious but we as Believers we have
[2:26:58] been told
[2:26:59] where we understand we are not saying a
[2:27:02] woman cannot
[2:27:04] work all right the Bible talks about her
[2:27:07] in
[2:27:09] Proverbs a woman who supports her
[2:27:12] husband she's a virtuous woman why it's
[2:27:16] not easy to give birth to Children raise
[2:27:20] them and then on top of
[2:27:22] it support your
[2:27:24] husband it is not easy women who do it
[2:27:29] they need to be
[2:27:31] respected but they must do it with
[2:27:35] agreement of their
[2:27:37] husband that's what the Bible tells us
[2:27:40] and I'm preaching to you the message of
[2:27:41] the
[2:27:43] hour hallelujah amen praise the name of
[2:27:46] the Lord all right so now go then came
[2:27:50] to the
[2:27:52] serpent when he came to the serpent he
[2:27:55] didn't even have any
[2:27:57] words to ask him serpent why did you do
[2:28:01] this I will tell you today why God never
[2:28:05] asked the
[2:28:07] serpent the reason is the serpent was
[2:28:12] only a
[2:28:16] victim it was the
[2:28:18] devil but the serpent was you
[2:28:20] used his body was used his mouth was
[2:28:24] used his brains was used his seed was
[2:28:28] used and because of that God could not
[2:28:31] ask it because he didn't have free
[2:28:34] wasn't a free
[2:28:36] AG but God made sure that that will
[2:28:40] never happen
[2:28:43] again how did he do it he told you Ser
[2:28:47] because you have accepted to be used
[2:28:51] from today you will no longer have
[2:28:54] legs from today you will no longer have
[2:28:57] hands you will no longer eat like human
[2:29:00] beings eat I'm removing your mouth I'm
[2:29:04] even going to make you it
[2:29:08] dust and even you will crowl on your
[2:29:12] belly and the moment God say those words
[2:29:16] a power came on the
[2:29:20] it became a snake a snake we see today
[2:29:24] is because it was
[2:29:26] cast but remember this Beast was the
[2:29:30] most
[2:29:31] handsome and most wise of all Beasts of
[2:29:35] the
[2:29:35] ground even today in its cast
[2:29:40] form it is very
[2:29:43] wise the moment a snake comes out of the
[2:29:47] egg it can eat
[2:29:51] it can
[2:29:52] bite very wise to the extent the Bible
[2:29:56] says be wise as
[2:30:02] serp but Harless as
[2:30:05] DS why because a serpent was wise when
[2:30:09] it was a
[2:30:11] beast even now to the Snake Still wise
[2:30:17] still beautiful on the outside
[2:30:20] see the snake
[2:30:23] skin very
[2:30:25] beautiful they make
[2:30:27] shoes and other things out of it very
[2:30:32] beautiful and the devil likes beautiful
[2:30:38] things I'm sorry if you're beautiful
[2:30:42] today the devil ask beautiful things you
[2:30:46] got to all the
[2:30:47] prostitutes the devil will never pick
[2:30:49] ugly
[2:30:51] he will pick the
[2:30:57] beautiful yes he will pick the beautiful
[2:31:00] ones you look at all the
[2:31:04] homosexuals he will not pick ugly
[2:31:08] boys they are those ones who look so
[2:31:11] handsome they are the ones he will use
[2:31:15] because the devil likes beautiful things
[2:31:20] but why are we here we are here to give
[2:31:25] notice to the kingdom of darkness that
[2:31:28] this beauty is given to us by
[2:31:31] God there are still a people that can
[2:31:35] live for God and use their beauty to
[2:31:39] serve the Lord and to show that God
[2:31:43] still has a
[2:31:45] generation that will serve him that will
[2:31:48] live for him that's why the bride is on
[2:31:52] Earth to prove to the devil the beauty
[2:31:56] wasn't meant for
[2:31:57] you no the reason I'm
[2:32:01] beautiful is not to go on Tik
[2:32:04] Tok and share how my lips are very
[2:32:11] juicy that's not why I'm
[2:32:14] beautiful I am not going to do that
[2:32:17] TR believers don't do that
[2:32:21] trash stay away from that
[2:32:24] trash when others are using social media
[2:32:28] to
[2:32:28] display their beauty as a bunch of
[2:32:32] tomatoes and
[2:32:33] [Music]
[2:32:36] mangoes the bride of Christ will not do
[2:32:40] that they will keep their beauty for
[2:32:43] their husband they will keep their
[2:32:45] beauty for the Lord they will use their
[2:32:48] body to serve God
[2:32:50] why because our body is the Temple of
[2:32:53] the Holy
[2:32:55] Ghost
[2:32:58] amen praise the name of the Lord now the
[2:33:01] denominational people they don't like
[2:33:04] these things I'm saying but what I'm
[2:33:06] saying are
[2:33:08] facts and you find younger
[2:33:11] girls and these days even younger
[2:33:15] boys take the
[2:33:18] smartphones and they go there
[2:33:20] you find them posting on their
[2:33:24] status and there is a music in the
[2:33:29] back of the
[2:33:31] world even if it has Jesus in it the
[2:33:36] songs because they have filthy spirits
[2:33:39] on
[2:33:40] them we can see it by what you
[2:33:42] doing you can't put a spiritual song in
[2:33:44] the
[2:33:46] background you put that F the song
[2:33:56] and then you post on
[2:34:03] your may God have Mery may God have
[2:34:06] mercy young people of DVS don't be
[2:34:11] entailed in that
[2:34:13] trash stay away from it stay clear from
[2:34:17] it why because you are
[2:34:22] special we are not like them no no no no
[2:34:25] no we have to be
[2:34:29] different and I'm I'm I'm I'm going in
[2:34:31] the beginning to show you how everything
[2:34:35] started so now we find that the
[2:34:39] serpent was
[2:34:41] cast Never
[2:34:43] Again to have a child in the human
[2:34:46] race but the effects
[2:34:50] of that we can still feel
[2:34:55] it everyone that is born is born in a
[2:35:00] way of
[2:35:02] perers you know when job was
[2:35:04] suffering he
[2:35:07] shouted meaning he was trying to say it
[2:35:10] was not job the flesh
[2:35:12] shouting it was that soul in him crying
[2:35:15] out said oh God in sin
[2:35:20] did my mother
[2:35:24] consider I'm only trapped here
[2:35:28] Lord but I don't belong
[2:35:31] here we have a
[2:35:33] body a body that is not
[2:35:37] sin all the children of
[2:35:40] God and when you born the moment you're
[2:35:44] born that body is right in the presence
[2:35:46] of
[2:35:47] God that
[2:35:51] body but the more sins you
[2:35:54] do that body begins moving towards
[2:35:59] hell but that's why even
[2:36:02] children
[2:36:05] children you should be
[2:36:07] careful how you treat
[2:36:10] them do you know you can speak certain
[2:36:14] words to that child and it can take them
[2:36:18] to hell
[2:36:22] don't just cuss
[2:36:24] children speak sharp
[2:36:26] words speak vgar
[2:36:31] words they are little
[2:36:34] angels don't just show them
[2:36:37] anger don't provoke
[2:36:40] them why because they
[2:36:43] Angel what is it is a theop body is
[2:36:46] before the presence of God
[2:36:49] and don't grieve
[2:36:51] them even he says the kingdom of
[2:36:53] God will be like the little
[2:36:57] children children don't go to
[2:36:59] hell they go to heaven why because the
[2:37:02] theop is
[2:37:04] right they many things we can talk
[2:37:07] about but I want to follow
[2:37:09] the we should know who we
[2:37:13] [Music]
[2:37:15] are
[2:37:17] see we all have that
[2:37:20] body which is
[2:37:23] sinless and it's a the body now when you
[2:37:27] hear the word
[2:37:28] of and you accept it you are
[2:37:32] connecting with that
[2:37:36] the praise
[2:37:39] God there are many many
[2:37:41] things I promise you not to to be so
[2:37:44] long so let me follow the thought
[2:37:47] here are you still following
[2:37:50] now the tree of
[2:37:52] knowledge good and
[2:37:54] evil was Satan and Eve and Adam ate from
[2:38:01] him and when they did they died did you
[2:38:05] hear what I said they died when did they
[2:38:08] die as soon as they
[2:38:11] at death is what separation from
[2:38:16] God that's why no man has ever lived for
[2:38:19] one day
[2:38:22] the day you eat
[2:38:23] of in that day you eat thereof you will
[2:38:28] die you will die within that day you
[2:38:31] can't go beyond that
[2:38:33] day one day to
[2:38:35] God is a thousand years no man has ever
[2:38:39] lived for 1,000
[2:38:41] years no man since Adam meth lived 969
[2:38:49] has ever lived
[2:38:51] longest and that's why today we die at
[2:38:55] 78 it is going on reducing
[2:38:57] red because we cannot live for one
[2:39:00] day but brother sister when we go into
[2:39:03] our real bodies we shall live for more
[2:39:06] than one
[2:39:08] day because we shall have a millennium a
[2:39:11] millennium is one full
[2:39:14] day 1,000
[2:39:17] years we will be eternal
[2:39:20] like he is but Adam died Adam was
[2:39:25] eternally separated
[2:39:26] from and there is nothing Adam could
[2:39:30] do that could save
[2:39:33] him and that's the part I want us to
[2:39:35] look
[2:39:36] at Genesis
[2:39:39] 3
[2:39:42] 6 and when the woman saw that the tree
[2:39:44] was good for food and that was pleasant
[2:39:47] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[2:39:49] make one wise she took of the fruit
[2:39:52] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[2:39:54] her husband with her and he did itat and
[2:39:57] the eyes of them both were opened and
[2:39:59] they knew that they were naked and they
[2:40:02] solded fig leaves together and made
[2:40:04] themselves up
[2:40:24] now are you following me CH back there
[2:40:26] are you following I want you to see this
[2:40:29] when they
[2:40:31] sinned Adam took his wife we have now
[2:40:34] sinned we are now naked what are we
[2:40:38] going to do they went and they began
[2:40:41] their
[2:40:42] Works tell your neighbor they began
[2:40:44] their
[2:40:47] works good works right
[2:40:50] they were were naked and they wanted to
[2:40:52] cover their
[2:40:53] naked was that a bad work they were good
[2:40:57] works all right they began their works
[2:41:01] Adam we are
[2:41:02] sinners yes yes my wife we are sinners
[2:41:05] so what are we going to do let us dress
[2:41:08] properly because now we have seed let us
[2:41:12] get the cloes cover yourself
[2:41:15] cover where are you going to cover now I
[2:41:19] have these
[2:41:20] breasts okay okay I'll cover those
[2:41:22] breasts and also
[2:41:26] now because now we are sinners their
[2:41:30] works we are
[2:41:32] good but never good
[2:41:35] enough no amount of works you can do
[2:41:37] that will be good
[2:41:40] enough there are many Believers of this
[2:41:43] message who think they
[2:41:45] works is giving them a ticket to the
[2:41:47] rapture
[2:41:50] oh you know I'm doing my hair certain
[2:41:51] way oh you know me I dress like this
[2:41:55] there are many people who dress so
[2:41:57] well but when they are very big
[2:42:02] Sinners you can agree with me if you
[2:42:04] believe what I'm
[2:42:07] saying dressing so well talking so well
[2:42:12] does not take you to
[2:42:14] heaven and I'm not going to add anything
[2:42:16] on it that is the truth
[2:42:21] you know me I'm cutting my hair a
[2:42:23] certain there are many people who are
[2:42:25] very
[2:42:27] judgmental they will be the ones to to
[2:42:29] tell anybody and
[2:42:31] everyone that they are going to
[2:42:34] hell because they cutting a certain
[2:42:37] St brother how can you make your hair
[2:42:39] like this you're going to H unless you
[2:42:43] repent sister oh how can you dress like
[2:42:46] this you're going to hell unless you
[2:42:48] repent
[2:42:49] now Pastor are you saying works are not
[2:42:52] good works are good but I'm saying our
[2:42:57] works that we do within
[2:43:02] ourselves because of
[2:43:05] necessity are never good
[2:43:11] enough they are never good enough to buy
[2:43:14] you
[2:43:16] salvation Salvation is not up for sale
[2:43:21] you cannot bribe
[2:43:23] God some of you think you're going to go
[2:43:25] out
[2:43:27] there and do your things and then you
[2:43:30] come here dress well and that's where
[2:43:33] God will take you to heaven you can
[2:43:35] never blve
[2:43:38] God your Works cannot be a ticket to
[2:43:42] heaven the works that you do Adam sold
[2:43:46] fig leaves
[2:43:49] with his wife and they hid themselves
[2:43:52] they say now we are comfortable we have
[2:43:55] now done so well when God comes he will
[2:43:59] surely be happy with us we have many
[2:44:02] believers who are like that and maybe
[2:44:04] some of them are here you think because
[2:44:07] you go to a a message
[2:44:09] church and you don't wear earrings and
[2:44:12] you don't use makeup and you don't wear
[2:44:15] Min
[2:44:16] SC and and you don't wear those high
[2:44:18] heel
[2:44:19] you think you are going to heaven I am
[2:44:22] sorry you are not going because of
[2:44:27] that you are you are not going because
[2:44:30] of
[2:44:31] that none of what you have
[2:44:34] done none of what you are going to
[2:44:37] do will be the
[2:44:40] basis of you being a Rapture
[2:44:44] material my daughters are you
[2:44:47] hearing are you hearing
[2:44:50] don't you think that because you call
[2:44:53] yourself a message
[2:44:54] believer and you dress well you don't
[2:44:57] use
[2:45:00] makeup that now you going to
[2:45:02] theup when we talk about I'm thinking
[2:45:05] about the
[2:45:06] Rapture you even be so

[2:45:14] blessed me when I dress I dress very

[2:45:22] ground I'm thinking about
[2:45:24] the I feel like I'm
[2:45:28] already
[2:45:30] sorry you may be surprised to
[2:45:36] remain that's why I told you today I was
[2:45:39] teaching
[2:45:41] because I don't want us to think we can
[2:45:45] bra
[2:45:46] God I want us to understand
[2:45:49] what salvation is I want us to
[2:45:52] understand what the message
[2:45:54] is I want us to understand what is it
[2:45:56] that we
[2:45:58] believe some people have made this
[2:46:02] message A bunch of Dos and
[2:46:07] Dons this message let me tell you this
[2:46:10] message is beyond dos and
[2:46:13] don'ts it is beyond
[2:46:15] that much beyond that
[2:46:19] if you give me a few more
[2:46:21] moments I'll will prove that to
[2:46:24] you praise the name of the
[2:46:26] Lord so they so fig leaves
[2:46:31] together they met Hallelujah they made
[2:46:37] themselves
[2:46:41] aons they made themselves good
[2:46:46] works brother because I do this
[2:46:50] is that one a Believer no he's not a
[2:46:52] Believer can't you see he's having an
[2:46:56] earring can't you see having a
[2:46:59] Min we as human beings we determine
[2:47:02] Believers like
[2:47:05] that but God goes
[2:47:08] beyond he goes beyond your
[2:47:14] works now are you fighting against good
[2:47:16] works
[2:47:19] at
[2:47:19] all if you give me time by the end of it
[2:47:23] all you will be
[2:47:28] satisfied in the message power of
[2:47:32] transformation but don't wait until you
[2:47:34] understand to say Amen just say
[2:47:38] Amen now in God
[2:47:41] aen they were
[2:47:44] naked and they did not know it and now
[2:47:48] now today
[2:47:49] in
[2:47:51] Satan be it by science and
[2:47:55] education they are naked
[2:47:58] again and they don't know it what a
[2:48:01] perversion look at today look at man
[2:48:06] trying to wear his wife's underneath
[2:48:10] clothes and she's trying to wear his
[2:48:13] cles
[2:48:18] man in a
[2:48:21] sh which a woman is supposed to put on
[2:48:25] inside you find him putting
[2:48:28] on walking
[2:48:34] inket you are naked and you don't know
[2:48:36] it you are putting on a
[2:48:39] short clothes your wife is supposed to
[2:48:41] put
[2:48:42] on find a woman putting on a man put on
[2:48:47] a Je
[2:48:49] and he's trying to let his hair grow
[2:48:51] like

[2:48:59] Jes oh oh oh my man trying to be a
[2:49:04] woman women trying to be a
[2:49:07] man what a perversion that's the same
[2:49:11] thing in the church is doing the same
[2:49:12] thing
[2:49:13] today
[2:49:15] church are you listening church are you
[2:49:18] still listening the reason that they
[2:49:21] didn't know they were
[2:49:24] naked in the
[2:49:26] beginning there was a holy spirit
[2:49:31] Veil which veiled them from
[2:49:35] nakedness hallelujah amen tell your
[2:49:38] neighbor Holy
[2:49:42] Spirit In the Beginning they had it on
[2:49:45] their eyes but
[2:49:47] theend that's why they not know they
[2:49:49] were
[2:49:50] naked so don't don't say me I am naked
[2:49:55] like
[2:49:57] like no there is another Veil on you
[2:50:01] now after the
[2:50:03] fall there is another
[2:50:07] Veil at first the Holy Spirit was over
[2:50:10] their
[2:50:11] eyes they see nothing but their brother
[2:50:14] and
[2:50:17] sister the holy
[2:50:19] they didn't know they were
[2:50:21] naked but now everybody said now the
[2:50:25] spirit of
[2:50:27] unholiness the speed of
[2:50:29] unlean and last has veiled
[2:50:34] them education and
[2:50:37] science at first when you would see a
[2:50:41] sister when Adam saw Eve he was not he
[2:50:45] was
[2:50:46] okay even now you can't understand it
[2:50:49] because there's another Veil on you
[2:50:52] now the veil of
[2:50:55] last
[2:50:57] unlean and
[2:50:59] unholiness that one cannot make you
[2:51:01] understand what
[2:51:03] we it's Avail on the people
[2:51:07] now the moment they look even a man of
[2:51:14] God he looked
[2:51:19] go
[2:51:22] bring another
[2:51:24] Veil why it is
[2:51:27] scientific they say wear shorts it is
[2:51:33] cooler the Indians teach you better than
[2:51:37] that they wrap up in a
[2:51:40] blanket to be air
[2:51:43] condition education has absolutely come
[2:51:45] back to a Time the very thing that they
[2:51:47] think that brought them our culture and
[2:51:49] civilization it has put them back again
[2:51:51] in ignorance
[2:51:57] again was they were in the first
[2:51:59] place when man realized he was
[2:52:03] naked he took upon himself to
[2:52:06] dress to dress with a leaves
[2:52:11] Aron this was man's Wisdom and
[2:52:16] Science by man was very wise
[2:52:19] he became so wise do you remember what
[2:52:22] the devil told them if you eat of this
[2:52:25] tree God is
[2:52:27] lying you are going to become wise you
[2:52:30] will be like him indeed go they become
[2:52:34] wise but their wisdom what did it tell
[2:52:37] them their wisdom told them to make
[2:52:41] Leaves and make
[2:52:44] up and they thought they can cover
[2:52:46] themselves
[2:52:48] were wise because that's what they they
[2:52:51] needed to
[2:52:52] do but they did it
[2:52:54] wrongly you will be wise in your own
[2:52:58] concept by knowing that you need to
[2:53:01] dress women today are wise they know
[2:53:04] they need to dress but they not doing it
[2:53:07] correctly because there is a wrong
[2:53:09] Spirit on
[2:53:11] them this
[2:53:13] wisdom it was agreeable to
[2:53:16] man so today you find people who believe
[2:53:19] it does not matter what
[2:53:22] you why they have a veil on
[2:53:26] them they claim God looks at our hearts
[2:53:31] only and not our
[2:53:33] clothes they have a veil on
[2:53:36] them you also find those who believe
[2:53:39] that you wear what you wear makes you a
[2:53:44] Believer both of them are wrong so you
[2:53:47] find people who are very good at
[2:53:50] gossiping but they busting about how
[2:53:53] good their dress code
[2:53:57] is very Immortal people but very proud
[2:54:01] on how they look
[2:54:03] s and then you have on the other side
[2:54:06] those ones who say it doesn't
[2:54:09] matter what I dress it doesn't matter
[2:54:14] God looks at
[2:54:17] the god they are they are
[2:54:21] blinded see both sides are
[2:54:24] wrong are you hearing me both sides are
[2:54:27] wrong if you think what you wear serves
[2:54:31] you you are wrong if you think what you
[2:54:34] wear doesn't matter you are wrong both
[2:54:38] of you are having a wrong of
[2:54:41] fa it is none of these that qualify you
[2:54:44] before
[2:54:46] God oh praise God the Bible in the book
[2:54:51] of Isaiah
[2:54:52] 646 he says that we we all are as unlean
[2:54:59] thing and all our
[2:55:02] righte as filthy
[2:55:05] rugs all our
[2:55:07] righteousness tell your neighbor all my
[2:55:10] righteousness is as a filthy
[2:55:14] RS oh my good Lord our righteousness
[2:55:18] is filthy rugs
[2:55:21] brother we cannot boast in any good
[2:55:25] thing that we have
[2:55:26] done or in any good thing we can
[2:55:30] do that's what Adam fa to
[2:55:33] understand and when God came down what
[2:55:36] did he do did he clap thank you my son
[2:55:40] oh you're wise you have dressed
[2:55:44] yourself God was angry what do you think
[2:55:47] you're doing
[2:55:49] and God
[2:55:51] went this is what I want to get to
[2:55:53] youday God went and this is the only
[2:55:57] thing that can save
[2:55:59] us and take us to
[2:56:02] the god
[2:56:05] went looking at the condition of his
[2:56:08] son and he went to his
[2:56:11] ship and took one squeezed it squeezed
[2:56:15] it cut the ne
[2:56:18] blood
[2:56:19] SP blood went all
[2:56:22] over and then he began
[2:56:26] skinning it must have been a great
[2:56:28] work it must have been a great
[2:56:33] work
[2:56:36] peeled and when he brought
[2:56:38] it he dressed
[2:56:40] you it was still dripping with
[2:56:45] blood and he dressed him he Adam
[2:56:48] I want you to dress this one yes you
[2:56:51] were wise you have to dress but not your
[2:56:54] own
[2:56:55] righteousness not your Works my work not
[2:57:00] yours my work and that's what God is
[2:57:03] saying to us
[2:57:05] today many people are doing their
[2:57:09] Works God wants his work to be reflected
[2:57:12] in
[2:57:14] [Music]
[2:57:15] us as I'm continuing
[2:57:18] let us read the scripture we read and
[2:57:20] and you see what I was talking
[2:57:22] about it says for by Grace Hallelujah my
[2:57:25] M this powerful for by grace are ye
[2:57:29] saved through faith and that not of
[2:57:33] yourselves everybody said not of
[2:57:36] myself it is the gift of
[2:57:39] God and he says not of
[2:57:42] Works L any man should
[2:57:45] BST hallelujah amen not of works there
[2:57:50] is nothing I've done please open your
[2:57:53] mind and understand what I'm saying
[2:57:56] there is nothing I can do that can save
[2:57:59] me oh Wretched Man that I am but then
[2:58:02] here he say we are his
[2:58:07] workmanship we are his
[2:58:09] workmanship meaning he has a
[2:58:13] work if you understand that say Amen oh
[2:58:16] hallelujah hallelujah Jesus Christ God
[2:58:19] himself has done a
[2:58:22] work and he says we his

[2:59:04] explain now when he did his
[2:59:08] work he's saying we became his
[2:59:13] workmanship Hallelujah and then he
[2:59:15] says we were actually
[2:59:20] ordained that none of our works can do
[2:59:22] it but it says here we were
[2:59:27] created in
[2:59:29] who who is your
[2:59:32] father now remember each of you has a
[2:59:43] father and I was and I was born in him
[2:59:47] born out of him

[3:05:19] that is God but if thou Willl enter into
[3:05:21] life keep the
[3:05:32] Commandments he said unto him which

[3:06:30] teaching
[3:06:31] today is going to help a lot of people
[3:06:35] and that's why I'm taking my
[3:06:36] time and I want you to follow me
[3:06:39] Clos Jesus is here speaking to a man who
[3:06:44] has come to
[3:06:46] him asking what he can
[3:06:49] do that will give him etal life and
[3:06:54] Jesus answered the man he said you know
[3:06:56] the works of the
[3:06:57] Lord God do them now I know we have
[3:07:00] talked about this many
[3:07:02] times but today as I was studying
[3:07:05] it there's another touch to it and I
[3:07:08] wanted to follow
[3:07:09] Clos and and the man said I've done all
[3:07:12] these
[3:07:13] Works loving God with all my heart oh
[3:07:16] I've done that one
[3:07:18] loving my neighbor I that one listen in
[3:07:22] the man's
[3:07:24] [Music]
[3:07:26] lens he was
[3:07:30] perfect he had seen that his works
[3:07:34] we and he had given himself tick
[3:07:38] tick and he had told God that is Jesus
[3:07:41] Christ I am good I am
[3:07:45] perfect and and remember when he first
[3:07:48] came he told him good master and Jesus
[3:07:52] said what why do you call me good only
[3:07:56] God is good to try to show him there is
[3:07:59] no one who is
[3:08:00] good no human being that is good only
[3:08:04] God is
[3:08:08] good but here he was also saying
[3:08:12] something that some of you did not see
[3:08:15] he was telling him I am God
[3:08:19] you didn't get it cuz he was telling
[3:08:22] him he called him good
[3:08:24] Master why do you call me good only God
[3:08:27] is good but he did not say I am not
[3:08:34] good the word of God is so delicious I
[3:08:37] tell you he's trying to tell you I am if
[3:08:41] you're calling me good that means I am
[3:08:45] godu praise the name Lord the man
[3:08:49] claimed to have all the
[3:08:52] Commandments Jesus exposed the
[3:08:56] GRE in this man he exposed he didn't
[3:09:00] love God or his neighbor with all his
[3:09:04] heart because with the law of
[3:09:06] Works none of us can ever match up with
[3:09:10] God's standard of
[3:09:12] [Music]
[3:09:15] righteousness God has
[3:09:18] standard but many times we we measure
[3:09:21] God according to our
[3:09:24] standard tell your neighbor God has a
[3:09:28] standard God has a
[3:09:30] standard tell someone behind you there
[3:09:32] do tell them God has a
[3:09:35] stand God has a standard
[3:09:38] brother can you tell brother samel slap
[3:09:40] him and tell him
[3:09:43] God oh this one is just touching him
[3:09:48] is your big brother you give him
[3:09:50] a him God
[3:09:52] stand praise the name of the Lord how
[3:09:55] many enjoying the word I tell you the
[3:09:57] word is so
[3:09:59] delicious amen right now we are
[3:10:02] eating we are eating and we are
[3:10:05] growing
[3:10:07] so here God's standard
[3:10:10] is righteousness
[3:10:12] and but Adam was below God stand
[3:10:17] because he only covered
[3:10:19] here and when God came he covered
[3:10:23] everywhere that was God
[3:10:26] standard but Adam could not do God's
[3:10:28] standard on his
[3:10:32] own needed a supernatural
[3:10:37] hand now you see why you need to be
[3:10:39] filled with the Holy
[3:10:41] Spirit if you're not filled with the
[3:10:43] Holy Spirit you will never make it to
[3:10:46] the rapture
[3:10:47] the reason is you will do good works but
[3:10:51] you will never fit God's
[3:10:55] standard this man was good in all his
[3:10:59] Works he said I've loved my neighbor
[3:11:01] I've Loved God with all it's all
[3:11:05] right here you called me God so let me
[3:11:08] tell
[3:11:09] you you have riches go sell everything
[3:11:13] and give the money to the god tested him
[3:11:16] on two occasion
[3:11:18] scenarios number
[3:11:20] one sell
[3:11:22] everything give to the poor the poor is
[3:11:26] who your
[3:11:29] neighbor remember the law was
[3:11:31] saying love your
[3:11:34] neighb with all your heart right and
[3:11:37] also love God with all your mind all
[3:11:40] your
[3:11:41] heart so now you called me
[3:11:44] God and you said you love your neighbor
[3:11:47] all right sell what you have give to
[3:11:49] your neighbor and then come follow me I
[3:11:52] am God right you said I'm good I told
[3:11:55] you only God is good all right so since
[3:11:57] I'm good then I am God come follow
[3:12:01] me the man right there he began
[3:12:06] shaking all my riches I cannot sell all
[3:12:10] my
[3:12:11] riches and and give to the
[3:12:14] poor why did they work for themselves
[3:12:18] he the man didn't love his neighbor as
[3:12:23] himself many of you say you you doing
[3:12:26] good things when God puts you on his on
[3:12:28] his
[3:12:31] balance you realize you are
[3:12:35] naked he the man didn't actually love
[3:12:37] his neighbor as
[3:12:39] himself the man was
[3:12:42] selfish he wanted to have his riches for
[3:12:45] himself so you he couldn't measure up to
[3:12:48] the righteousness of
[3:12:49] God but he thought he loved his neighbor
[3:12:53] because he used to throw something to
[3:12:57] them but that was his
[3:12:59] righteousness but God is
[3:13:02] righteousness give all he said no and
[3:13:06] then I follow you you you who has
[3:13:10] nothing but Jesus was like I thought you
[3:13:12] called me
[3:13:14] God who do you call God
[3:13:18] do you realize you love God with all
[3:13:19] your heart you have to forsake
[3:13:21] all so if you can't forsake all for this
[3:13:26] truth then you don't love God with all
[3:13:30] you and many of you say a Believer but
[3:13:33] the moment you have a V at home you
[3:13:36] won't even show up in
[3:13:39] church you love God believe sincere if
[3:13:43] you are truly convinced you going to be
[3:13:46] concerned
[3:13:49] you are my mother you my friend you my
[3:13:51] whatever you found me going to church
[3:13:54] let us go together because you want them
[3:13:56] to love the god you love you want them
[3:13:59] receive what you have
[3:14:01] received but you find believer staying
[3:14:03] at
[3:14:04] home I had a
[3:14:06] v God have
[3:14:09] mercy do you love God with all your
[3:14:12] heart are you willing to sacrifice
[3:14:14] everything for this
[3:14:15] truth what truth God is
[3:14:20] truth now this man was wide on the
[3:14:23] balance and he was found
[3:14:27] lucky the law proved that man was a
[3:14:31] sinner and needed a
[3:14:34] Sav you didn't get it again I don't know
[3:14:37] whether you're tired or what you didn't
[3:14:38] get it this man had done everything the
[3:14:41] Lord
[3:14:43] said but he never mashed up to God's
[3:14:45] righteousness
[3:14:47] so what did the Lord do what did the
[3:14:50] Lord do the LA only
[3:14:53] proved he was a
[3:14:56] sinner do this don't do that do this do
[3:14:58] that there are many believers who do
[3:15:00] those
[3:15:01] things and who don't do things but the
[3:15:04] only thing they have proved to
[3:15:05] God is their
[3:15:08] Sinners it does the same thing
[3:15:10] today what we
[3:15:12] need is not our
[3:15:15] works what we need
[3:15:17] is his work we need a
[3:15:22] savioru in his
[3:15:25] work we can
[3:15:27] burst in our
[3:15:29] wordss we cannot
[3:15:31] bust but we can burst in his
[3:15:35] finished let me read this for you there
[3:15:37] he hangs on the
[3:15:39] cross you will never have to stand the
[3:15:43] Judgment God judged your sins in him
[3:15:48] God judged him and he took your
[3:15:51] place there is something I'm trying to
[3:15:53] come to to conclude
[3:15:55] now God took his your place in
[3:15:59] him we were
[3:16:01] guilty eared from
[3:16:04] God without hope without Mercy we were
[3:16:10] Gentiles away to D
[3:16:12] Idols alens from
[3:16:15] God and Christ brother Enoch Christ took
[3:16:18] our
[3:16:20] place and you notice Abraham slept and
[3:16:22] everybody
[3:16:25] slept but Christ
[3:16:27] died
[3:16:30] separated in his death God wasn't with
[3:16:35] him he had to
[3:16:37] suffer the absence of
[3:16:40] God in his death that we would have the
[3:16:44] presence of
[3:16:47] in our
[3:16:49] death did you know that we were supposed
[3:16:51] to die with the absence of
[3:16:53] [Music]
[3:16:55] God but right now Sister Grace you can
[3:17:00] never die with the absence of
[3:17:03] God it doesn't matter what takes your
[3:17:07] body because he died because he gave
[3:17:11] himself because he shed his blood his
[3:17:15] work alone
[3:17:17] took our
[3:17:19] place and he suffered the
[3:17:23] absence so that we can be in the
[3:17:29] presence and that is our
[3:17:32] judgment God struck upon him our
[3:17:37] judgment Hallelujah some many sins go
[3:17:40] before
[3:17:42] them and some other men's sins follow
[3:17:45] them
[3:17:50] you didn't get it so many sins go before
[3:17:53] [Music]
[3:17:55] them and others many sins go uh follow
[3:18:02] them now let's confess ours
[3:18:06] now so it will go before
[3:18:09] us and Christ met our
[3:18:11] judgment and God In The Garden of Aiden
[3:18:15] when he pronounced death on the human
[3:18:18] race the day you eat thereof the day you
[3:18:21] shall
[3:18:22] die every human being and death means
[3:18:27] separation that's the reason we call it
[3:18:29] death for one
[3:18:30] another we just separate from one
[3:18:33] another now what happened on the
[3:18:36] cross let me tell you what happened on
[3:18:38] the
[3:18:39] cross what happened on the cross is that
[3:18:42] our
[3:18:43] sins actually went before us
[3:18:53] you will Now understand the
[3:18:55] scripture that says they that are born
[3:18:57] of
[3:19:00] God cannot
[3:19:03] s your sins have gone
[3:19:08] before you cannot sin
[3:19:11] again it is
[3:19:13] impossible because you already judged
[3:19:16] that's why you cannot even come in the
[3:19:19] Judgment because you already judge when
[3:19:22] he was
[3:19:23] struck you were judg right there when he
[3:19:26] was crying on the
[3:19:29] cross what was that it was you crying
[3:19:33] you see you were being judged alone
[3:19:36] without
[3:19:37] God and today we cannot boast in the
[3:19:42] work he has done for us
[3:19:47] hallelujah hallelujah amen all we need
[3:19:51] today is
[3:19:52] Faith tell someone all we need today
[3:19:56] Faith all we need is faith in the
[3:19:58] finished
[3:20:01] work Romans
[3:20:03] 1116 for I am not ashamed of the
[3:20:06] Gospel the gospel of
[3:20:09] Christ for it is the power of
[3:20:12] God and to
[3:20:14] Salvation to everyone that what
[3:20:19] believe do you believe the message of
[3:20:21] the
[3:20:22] hour to all of you who
[3:20:24] believe hallelujah hallelujah for oh my
[3:20:28] God oh my God oh my God Amen it says for
[3:20:34] therein
[3:20:35] oh you didn't get brother if you get it
[3:20:38] the people will get
[3:20:40] it I'm not ashamed of
[3:20:43] what of the Gospel everybody say the
[3:20:47] gospel all right you you might as well
[3:20:49] say the message of
[3:20:52] the now you not ashamed of
[3:20:55] it for there
[3:20:58] is where in the message the the word in
[3:21:02] the
[3:21:03] gospel is the righteous of
[3:21:08] God
[3:21:10] Ral the righteousness of God is now
[3:21:14] revealed it is revealed
[3:21:17] where in the gospel in the message in
[3:21:20] the
[3:21:21] word it is revealed from
[3:21:24] Faith to Faith as it is written the
[3:21:30] just shall live by
[3:21:34] faith the gospel the message
[3:21:38] is he died he was buried and he rose
[3:21:42] again he is alive and he wants to live
[3:21:45] in you
[3:21:47] he wants to come in your life and to
[3:21:50] change your
[3:21:51] nature that is the
[3:21:53] gospel the gospel is the power of the
[3:21:55] Holy
[3:21:56] Ghost of the Risen
[3:21:59] Savior coming in your
[3:22:02] soul by the way if you don't receive the
[3:22:04] Holy
[3:22:05] Spirit you can never please
[3:22:08] God why because your Works will never be
[3:22:14] enough you will be like Adam
[3:22:18] you will not please
[3:22:20] God but when you accept his work which
[3:22:23] is finished the blood which is shed and
[3:22:26] then you believe in it and then you
[3:22:28] accepting it remember life is in the
[3:22:31] blood what can wash away my sin nothing
[3:22:36] blood you can't overcome those things
[3:22:39] which you inherited from
[3:22:42] your until you accept
[3:22:44] this with all your
[3:22:46] heart but you see to accept it there is
[3:22:50] something you need to
[3:22:51] do you need to sell everything
[3:22:55] El the problem with Christians many of
[3:22:58] them are not willing to do
[3:23:01] that they're not willing to forsake
[3:23:04] things they keep things in their
[3:23:07] life you keep that little
[3:23:09] boyfriend that girlfriend in your life
[3:23:13] that habit in your life and the more you
[3:23:15] keep it in to yourself you don't
[3:23:18] surrender it you will never find his
[3:23:24] work and you will never be able to
[3:23:25] attain his
[3:23:27] rightous everything you're doing is just
[3:23:30] laws but you will not attained to the
[3:23:33] level of his
[3:23:35] righteousness so he wants you to come in
[3:23:37] the place where his life can come in
[3:23:40] your
[3:23:42] life and then his
[3:23:44] nature will brood up in
[3:23:47] you now at that moment you don't need to
[3:23:51] struggle you know I would never want to
[3:23:54] wear
[3:23:55] this I feel I want a
[3:23:58] trouser don't worry where are your
[3:24:01] trouser so we can see that you not
[3:24:08] Chang but the moment you are
[3:24:11] Chang did you know when someone changes
[3:24:14] because of laws
[3:24:17] they will go back again to their
[3:24:19] V how many have seen such always go back
[3:24:24] but if you
[3:24:25] change because your Nature
[3:24:28] has you can never go back you can never
[3:24:32] go back you get totally changed from
[3:24:37] within because of his
[3:24:40] work you can never tell a lie again and
[3:24:43] you're struggling with lies
[3:24:46] God for God this mouth I'm giving to
[3:24:49] take away all the spirit of life it will
[3:24:51] not
[3:24:53] go do one thing sell everything you
[3:24:58] have surrender your
[3:25:00] life it is so
[3:25:03] simple but we complicate it the only
[3:25:06] thing you need to do is to surrender
[3:25:08] yourself to Jesus
[3:25:10] Christ now I understand us doing it here
[3:25:12] in the
[3:25:14] church but it can never be enough
[3:25:17] get time yourself I wonder how many he
[3:25:20] have ever done
[3:25:21] it you go somewhere remember we used to
[3:25:25] do it when you first you go in a bush
[3:25:29] somewhere and you kneel down no one is
[3:25:32] seeing you kneeing it's just you and
[3:25:35] God you know you're struggling with a
[3:25:37] spirit with a demon maybe you have lost
[3:25:40] or something you want to overcome you
[3:25:44] can't overcome by saying from to down
[3:25:46] what do again you
[3:25:47] can't you can't you will keep going back
[3:25:51] again but when you tap on his
[3:25:54] work you come you surrender to him alone
[3:25:58] with
[3:25:59] him God I'm
[3:26:02] burdened I cannot overcome without you I
[3:26:07] need you fill me with the Holy Spirit
[3:26:10] and determine in yourself not to leave
[3:26:13] that place until you filled with
[3:26:17] H do you know you will be filled with
[3:26:19] the Holy
[3:26:20] Spirit do you know it is possible do you
[3:26:23] know he promise it in his
[3:26:25] word it is not a struggling
[3:26:29] thing you you will come and pray and
[3:26:32] pray and PR and kick the devil and you
[3:26:35] go back and do the same same
[3:26:38] thing until you do what I
[3:26:40] told break in his
[3:26:43] presence humble
[3:26:45] yourself in in his presence you and him
[3:26:49] alone find time surrender yourself to
[3:26:54] his finished
[3:26:55] work because you can burst in
[3:26:58] that the moment you get an
[3:27:02] experience of the Holy Spirit you can
[3:27:05] never be the same
[3:27:06] again your nature will
[3:27:11] change because when he come and is in
[3:27:13] you he is greater than all
[3:27:17] he is greater than
[3:27:19] Temptations He is greater than your
[3:27:21] failures even greater than your flesh
[3:27:24] greater than your flesh greater than
[3:27:26] your
[3:27:27] sins greater than your
[3:27:30] weaknesses he is great actually he is
[3:27:32] greater than you even
[3:27:35] you his work on the
[3:27:37] cross made this
[3:27:40] possible and in this we
[3:27:44] boast PA said I don't in any other I
[3:27:48] bust in him and that's why when a man is
[3:27:51] filled with the Holy
[3:27:52] Ghost you no longer bust on anything you
[3:27:55] can do you know for you to live it is
[3:28:00] Christ your life is his you not
[3:28:03] struggling with things but you've
[3:28:05] yielded your life to him and is leading
[3:28:08] you a new nature is born in you when you
[3:28:11] receive that new
[3:28:13] nature you never want the world
[3:28:17] again no you can never go back in those
[3:28:21] things because Christ has
[3:28:26] visited please allow me to finish with
[3:28:30] this turn to to your Bible Romans
[3:28:35] 3:21 but now the righteousness of God
[3:28:38] without the law is manifested being
[3:28:40] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[3:28:42] even the righteousness of God which is
[3:28:44] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
[3:28:48] upon them that believe for there is no
[3:28:51] difference for all have seen and have
[3:28:53] come short of the glory of God being
[3:28:54] justified freely by his grace through
[3:28:56] the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[3:28:59] who God has sent set forth to be
[3:29:01] appropriation through faith in his blood
[3:29:04] to declare his righteousness oh my God
[3:29:08] for the remission of sins that are
[3:29:09] passed through the forbearance of God to
[3:29:12] declare I say at this time his
[3:29:14] righteousness that he might be just and
[3:29:17] the justifier of him which believeth in
[3:29:21] Jesus it is all by
[3:29:23] faith now the people you see it's your
[3:29:27] faith it is never your
[3:29:29] feeling it is nothing whether is so if
[3:29:32] it's if it's my hand isn't
[3:29:36] straight that doesn't have one thing to
[3:29:38] do with
[3:29:39] it if you you still have a problem in
[3:29:42] your life it has nothing to do with it
[3:29:44] it is my faith that does
[3:29:47] that right before us we see the image of
[3:29:50] a perfect healed person by
[3:29:55] faith your hand may be like this but if
[3:29:58] you believe in his word you see yourself
[3:30:02] perfectly and then we just make step by
[3:30:06] step till we step right into that
[3:30:10] person and just walk right on
[3:30:13] with what does it
[3:30:16] your faith not your
[3:30:18] feelings not your feelings your faith
[3:30:22] does and I'm
[3:30:26] concluding with these few
[3:30:28] comments it is not your
[3:30:32] feelings I feel like a sinner
[3:30:34] today I feel very holy spiritual your
[3:30:38] feelings will
[3:30:40] light it's not your
[3:30:43] feelings you may feel awful
[3:30:46] but if you have faith in his
[3:30:50] [Music]
[3:30:51] word he showed you there a man that is
[3:30:58] perfect and you are here the way you are
[3:31:02] I believe God is speaking to
[3:31:04] someone and you're like I feel this way
[3:31:09] I feel awful I feel this I feel that but
[3:31:13] it say it's not your feelings it is your
[3:31:15] faith
[3:31:17] now what what are you going to
[3:31:18] do you may go and pray and it may not
[3:31:22] work the first time second time the
[3:31:25] third time don't give
[3:31:29] up you understand don't give up keep
[3:31:33] walking step by
[3:31:36] step I
[3:31:38] know I'm going to go in the rupture and
[3:31:41] I know I'm going to be
[3:31:43] perfect I'm without spot
[3:31:46] I'm the bride of Christ the devil will
[3:31:48] tell you all sorts of things what about
[3:31:51] this you are lying yourself what about
[3:31:54] but you are walking step by
[3:31:56] step you you keep
[3:31:58] moving and I was telling someone the
[3:32:00] other day don't listen to your feelings
[3:32:04] your feelings will betray
[3:32:08] you you run if you can't run walk but if
[3:32:13] you can't walk at least you crawl
[3:32:16] but keep moving in the right
[3:32:19] direction you push yourself step by step
[3:32:24] and one of these days Brothers we are
[3:32:27] going to walk into this
[3:32:30] perfect when we walk in to that other
[3:32:33] body and all the Temptations weaknesses
[3:32:36] trials
[3:32:38] fail it will all be behind
[3:32:40] us and that's why in him before we reach
