[17:12] not going to be equal as an equal
[17:15] you know we are going to have different
[17:30] glorious

[17:38] you have learned from the lord
[17:44] we should talk about
[18:18] [Music]
[18:26] uh
[18:47] [Music]
[18:54] and now
[19:06] bring down all your 21
[19:18] did you know that whatever you have not
[19:19] done in 2021 you're not going to do it
[19:36] food
[19:47] [Music]
[19:49] this moment
[20:14] their plan is to plan on how to
[20:17] to
[20:18] torment you
[20:25] [Applause]
[20:33] [Music]
[20:46] god has given some few grace to be able
[20:49] to see in hell what happens
[20:54] and when this little boy where is he
[20:57] what was uh
[20:58] when he was born anywho where's that who
[21:01] are god gave us grace
[21:04] to see those demons
[21:07] which had okay we would not see them
[21:08] when we were planning in here
[21:12] we saw them when they had come to
[21:14] fulfill their out their plans
[21:19] at the same time
[21:23] in the morning or in the night
[21:26] and uh it was i was the first to wake up
[21:30] and i have seen you know them all around
[21:34] them
[21:36] squeeze the life out of him
[21:40] and you know they were talking with one
[21:43] another
[21:44] you see but
[21:46] talks about demons
[21:49] and when he was in um what you would
[21:51] call a designer session
[21:55] to tell someone maybe if you had a
[21:58] spirit which was
[21:59] tormenting you
[22:02] you know
[22:04] and then he is trying he is going to
[22:06] expose it
[22:09] let's say it is cancer
[22:25] and
[22:26] you know because the demon knows is
[22:28] about to be exposed
[22:35] at the moment he would expose that this
[22:37] one has cancer can we achieve
[22:59] and then many times in the meetings if
[23:01] you have been listening to the message
[23:02] of course some some of these things are
[23:04] enjoyable if you have been listening to
[23:05] them
[25:07] but i would like us to bring in
[25:10] everything in this service
[25:41] i believe that all of us here
[25:44] will also have enough time for prayers
[25:49] i really feel that the new year should
[25:50] find us when we are going in prayer
[26:08] but i will warn you
[26:11] you're not going to hear
[26:12] you know the kind of new year's newer
[26:14] message that you are you are you always
[26:16] here
[26:19] oh my god
[26:35] and i know well of course even when
[26:36] coffee came the first time they said
[26:38] this year yeah i said they're going to
[26:40] cook
[27:17] is
[27:46] 10
[28:15] and the lord said that to moses
[28:17] go in unto pharaoh for i have had in his
[28:20] heart
[28:23] and they out of his servants that i
[28:25] might show this
[28:27] this is my signs before you
[28:41] um
[29:11] and sun what things i have wrote in
[29:14] egypt
[29:14] and my signs which i have done among
[29:17] them that you may know how that i am the
[29:21] wrong hero
[29:39] amen
[29:41] and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh
[29:45] and said unto him
[29:47] thou saith the lord god of the hebrews
[29:50] how long would thou refuse to humble
[29:52] itself before me let my people go
[29:55] that they may serve me
[29:58] alone
[30:07] [Music]
[30:15] hallelujah
[30:22] so i don't think i would really want to
[30:25] thank god for this opportunity for this
[30:27] place
[30:30] uh we have good neighbors
[30:35] you know
[30:36] the lord gave me the desire for us to
[30:38] have this even before i knew that they
[30:40] were going to stop overnights
[31:09] now
[31:10] i know that we are coming we have come a
[31:13] long way germany
[31:16] we have come
[31:18] a long way of 12 months
[31:24] it's been not shocked but there will be
[31:26] it's been long about everyone how many
[31:29] things have you had in this year
[31:40] how many bad things have you had this
[31:42] year being to be making you all having a
[31:44] couple
[33:11] do you know many have died because they
[33:12] became sick
[33:15] of what they were saying and many were
[33:17] taken by the same sickness that was
[33:18] tormenting you
[33:20] allah
[33:50] and so when he came he returned
[33:53] actually before he when he was leaving
[33:56] he wrote a text on whatsapp group chat
[34:03] how many
[34:18] but you do not see it
[34:23] but to me i think that the very first
[34:25] message you should see every morning
[34:27] when you wake up is one day when the
[34:28] church group
[34:29] is
[35:00] quickly now
[35:11] as i will be traveling to toronto at 3am
[35:14] today for barry
[35:45] you know
[35:47] you know the whole family and the world
[35:48] church family would have been so sad
[35:50] family
[35:53] we are laughing but this is reality
[35:58] they were involved in a very terrible
[36:02] uh risk of an accident
[36:04] [Music]
[36:08] but the lord delivered them
[36:21] don't you think we should have a time
[36:23] like this
[37:04] driven life

[37:16] [Music]
[37:36] [Music]

[54:16] certain cause
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:37] how how do they do the bricks you know
[54:38] they have to
[54:41] they found themselves doing those kind
[54:42] of things
[54:45] they found themselves being beaten
[54:48] and they grew up many of them
[54:52] thinking that that was the reason why
[54:54] they were born
[54:59] they thought they were born to be slaves
[55:04] they thought they were born
[55:14] i never ever thought i'd seen anything
[55:18] else another

[56:57] doing that you are
[56:59] you you are backwards
[57:08] until you need this yeah
[57:45] [Applause]

[58:06] purpose-proven
[58:11] whatever you are doing you have a
[58:12] purpose
