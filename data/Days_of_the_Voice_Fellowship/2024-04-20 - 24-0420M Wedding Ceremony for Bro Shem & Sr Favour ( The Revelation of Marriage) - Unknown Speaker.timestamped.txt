[29:28] we are gathered here in the sight of God
[29:30] and in the presence of these
[29:35] witnesses to join
[29:42] together
[29:45] and in the bonds of holy
[29:49] matrimony according to the ordinance of
[29:53] God the custom of the Christian
[29:56] Church law of this
[29:59] nation and to on their behalf the
[30:01] blessing of
[30:04] God psms 1271 it is
[30:09] written except the Lord build the
[30:14] houseb in vain
[30:19] that marriage is
[30:22] Honorable it's a ho
[30:26] insti which was started by God in the
[30:29] garden
[30:31] ofen it was there that the Lord God
[30:36] said it is good that the man should be
[30:39] alone it is good it is not good that the
[30:42] man should be
[30:45] alone it was there that Eve was then
[30:47] fashioned out of the rib of
[30:54] Adam and given to him for a wife and it
[30:58] was thus
[31:01] recorded therefore shall a man leave his
[31:07] father and his mother and shall cleave
[31:10] unto his
[31:12] wife and they shall be one
[31:15] flesh it is also sanctioned and honored
[31:18] by Jesus's Christ Presence at the
[31:20] marriage in car in
[31:26] galile and this exists between between
[31:28] Christ and his
[31:31] church God ordains it as the foundation
[31:35] and bond of family
[31:40] life for the mut
[31:44] help for
[31:46] comfort of husband and
[31:49] wife and for the welfare of the
[31:55] State marriage there
[31:59] is not to be entered upon by
[32:03] any inadvisably
[32:09] lightly but should be entered into
[32:22] reverent and in the fear of
[32:26] God and into this holy estate these two
[32:29] persons now desire to
[32:34] enter by being joined together as
[32:39] one therefore If any man can show any
[32:43] just
[32:50] cause why these two may not LLY be
[32:53] joined together
[32:58] let him
[32:59] now declare
[33:08] it just had to be quiet for a
[33:13] moment and no one came
[33:16] up and so if there is
[33:19] any forever hold your
[33:22] [Music]
[33:26] peace need to say amen for that moreover
[33:31] I charge you
[33:32] both before
[33:35] God the searer of All
[33:38] Hearts if either of you know of any
[33:40] impediment why you may not LLY be United
[33:42] together as husband
[33:50] and do
[33:54] conf for be rest assured that you will
[33:57] surely answer the day of
[34:02] judgment when the secrets of all heart
[34:04] shall be
[34:07] disclosed if there is either of you that
[34:09] know of any impendent why you should not
[34:11] be LLY joined together in this
[34:18] holy be also assured that so many of us
[34:21] are joined together otherwise than God's
[34:24] word allow
[34:32] because there many who are living
[34:33] together but they were never joined
[34:34] together as God's word
[34:41] alls just know those are not United by
[34:43] the
[34:46] Lord neither is their marriage blessed
[34:49] by
[34:53] him and so that was just a little bit of

[43:06] today may we rejoice in our heart
[43:09] together
[43:10] with in Jesus name amen amen amen if you
[43:15] have a Bible you can turn with me if you
[43:16] do not just
[43:19] listen and I already started it out I'll
[43:22] just use my
[43:25] iPad IP so Ephesians chapter
[43:30] 5 31-32
[43:33] says for this cause shall a man leave
[43:36] his father and mother and shall be
[43:38] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[43:42] be one
[43:43] flesh this is a great mystery but I
[43:46] speak concerning Christ and the church
[43:48] that is uh Ephesians 5:31
[43:57] [Music]
[44:05] [Music]
[44:11] now I know usually on the wedding we are
[44:14] pre I'm preaching to you shame and I'm
[44:15] preaching to you
[44:19] favor I also know many times you don't
[44:22] hear everything because of what is going
[44:24] around in your mind
[44:30] the stress of the
[44:32] event so I'm privy to the fact that they
[44:35] are recording the service and streaming
[44:36] it live as
[44:41] well don't worry if I take a few moment
[44:43] like 30 minutes because I know you'll go
[44:44] back and and listen to that
[44:48] afterwards so now I'm going to speak to
[44:50] you on the revelation of
[44:53] marriage and I'm going to divide my
[44:56] thought into three three
[44:59] points and I'm going to ask the first
[45:02] question in forms in form of questions
[45:04] what is
[45:07] revelation What is
[45:09] marriage and to whom will God
[45:14] reveal so let's go quickly to the first
[45:18] question what is
[45:20] revelation because the Bible says that
[45:23] two becoming one is a mystery
[45:27] so if it is a
[45:29] mystery those who do it it means they
[45:32] have attained revelation of what the
[45:34] mystery
[45:36] is and so what is
[45:38] revelation now the Church of Jesus
[45:41] Christ is built upon
[45:44] revelation of who Jesus is and to be
[45:47] able to uh to to demonstrate this for
[45:51] you I'm going to read the scripture in
[45:52] the Book of Matthew 16
[45:57] vers 13 to
[45:59] 19 um it says when Jesus came into the
[46:02] course of ceria
[46:05] Philippi he asked his disciples
[46:08] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[46:11] man
[46:12] am and they said some say that thou art
[46:15] John the
[46:17] Baptist some Elias others
[46:20] Jeremiah oh one of the prophets he said
[46:24] unto
[46:24] them whom say ye that I
[46:28] am all right now this is Jesus Christ on
[46:31] Earth and is you know with the
[46:35] disciples and and he's asking them what
[46:37] the people say that he
[46:40] is and of course they said some call you
[46:43] John you El some call you
[46:45] Jeremiah but then he brought it
[46:49] down to them what about you what do you
[46:53] say that I the son
[46:55] of and then you know the all looked at
[46:57] each other but on verse
[46:59] 16 one of them Simon Peter
[47:02] answered and he said thou the Christ the
[47:07] son of the Living God and Jesus answered
[47:09] and said unto
[47:11] him blessed thou
[47:14] Simon flesh and blood has not revealed
[47:17] it unto
[47:19] thee but my Father which is in
[47:22] heaven and I say unto thee that thou
[47:26] Peter
[47:27] Upon This Rock I will build my
[47:29] church and the Gat of Hell shall not
[47:32] Prevail
[47:33] against I give unto the the Keys of the
[47:35] Kingdom of
[47:36] Heaven whatever thou shall bind on Earth
[47:40] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou
[47:42] shall lose on shall be Lo in heaven so
[47:45] now the Church of Jesus
[47:47] Christ is built listen Upon This
[47:51] Rock and the question is what is the
[47:55] rock now some the Roman Catholics say
[47:58] that the rock is
[48:01] Peter and you know Peter was buried in
[48:05] in in
[48:07] Rome and they built a big
[48:11] church and called it St Peter
[48:15] Basilica and they said now you know the
[48:18] church this is the church the first
[48:20] church
[48:22] CH that's why Catholic means Universal
[48:27] they mean that their church is the only
[48:28] one true Universal Church of
[48:32] Christ
[48:34] upon and the Protestants
[48:36] say that no it's not Peter it is Jesus
[48:41] upon whom the church is
[48:43] built but the question is what is this
[48:48] rock the rock that Jesus was speaking
[48:52] of was neither
[48:54] Peter nor Jesus but he said this flesh
[48:59] and blood has not revealed this unto
[49:02] you but my Father which is in
[49:05] heaven and Upon This
[49:07] Rock upon which rock upon the upon the
[49:12] revelation of Jesus of Who Let me put it
[49:16] this way upon the revelation of who
[49:18] Jesus
[49:20] is that Peter had
[49:24] received that was The Rock
[49:27] and the Church of Jesus
[49:29] Christ is built upon the
[49:32] revelation of who Jesus
[49:35] Christ and that church is a mystical
[49:39] body that church is is a mysterious body
[49:43] let me call it that way you can't see it
[49:46] with eyes it is a universal
[49:50] church all over the world it is not
[49:53] Anglican it's not Catholic not
[49:57] Pentecostal but what is that church it
[49:59] is the body of Jesus
[50:02] Christ those who have a
[50:04] revelation who Jesus Christ is and who
[50:09] is Jesus Christ amen is he that was in
[50:13] heaven God he came and put on flesh and
[50:17] he dwelt among us and we beheld his
[50:20] glory the only glory of the begotten of
[50:24] the father so who was Jesus Christ
[50:27] the savior of the
[50:28] body who is Jesus Christ he's the head
[50:33] and the church is the body who is Jesus
[50:35] Christ he's the husband and the church
[50:38] is the wife who is Jesus Christ is the
[50:42] male and we are his
[50:44] wife Revelation 197
[50:47] says be glad and rejoice for the
[50:51] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[50:55] wife has made her
[50:58] so the Church of Jesus Christ is in
[51:01] Kenya is in Ethiopia is in zimb my
[51:05] friend from
[51:06] Zim where is he is he right in here
[51:09] outside okay he's from
[51:12] Zimbabwe is all over the
[51:14] world the Church of Jesus Christ is not
[51:17] limited to a place or to a denomination
[51:21] or to a place like this but it is a
[51:24] mystical
[51:25] body Jesus Christ is the husband of he
[51:29] came down from Glory who was he he was
[51:32] God
[51:34] himself God is a spirit and as a spirit
[51:38] he could not die for us so he had to put
[51:41] on flesh so he can come down and bleed
[51:44] and
[51:45] die God put on flesh and he came down
[51:51] but I have a question why did he come
[51:53] down he came to redeem his
[51:58] so who are we if you believe in Jesus
[52:00] Christ you are his
[52:03] wife you are the Church of Jesus Christ
[52:06] but to believe that you have to have the
[52:11] Revelation it's it's a
[52:14] type what we are having here is a type
[52:17] of
[52:18] that is a physical
[52:22] manifestation of the spiritual thing
[52:23] that is already going on
[52:27] today is redeeming his
[52:29] bride he found his bride in M's
[52:33] home and he went to redeem her Jesus
[52:37] Christ came down on Earth and he found
[52:39] us here on Earth and he came to redeem
[52:42] us to
[52:42] him amen it is a
[52:45] revelation and the Church of Jesus
[52:47] Christ is not built upon
[52:50] Creeds it's not built upon
[52:52] Dogma built upon Christ the revelation
[52:56] Christ
[52:58] is Jesus Christ is his own
[53:03] word and all the Believers all over the
[53:06] world when they hear that they believe
[53:09] it and the first thing they
[53:11] do they take his
[53:14] name when you hear about
[53:17] it Jesus Christ my
[53:19] husband then you say I accept him as my
[53:23] personal what comes next his name how in
[53:29] water Christian
[53:32] baptism it must
[53:34] be in the only one
[53:37] name which we have given on Earth
[53:41] whereby we can be
[53:43] saved the Bible says there is no other
[53:46] name given to us to be
[53:49] saved The Only Name which can redeem
[53:52] us The Only Name which can save
[53:55] us that name
[53:58] is Jesus
[54:00] Christ that's why when we are baptizing
[54:04] we baptize people in the name of the
[54:06] Lord Jesus
[54:08] Christ it's a powerful name it's a
[54:12] mighty name Hallelujah from today she's
[54:16] taking another name because she's
[54:18] redeemed she's taken out of a family and
[54:23] joining another family
[54:26] it
[54:27] beautiful is a
[54:29] revelation so this Revelation is given
[54:32] by God
[54:34] Alone no man figures it
[54:37] out and it alone is that
[54:41] Revelation that a GS of Hell cannot
[54:46] Prevail the revelation of
[54:49] marriage oh my God I'll finish with that
[54:52] God's Prophet said
[54:53] it it show the gates of hell would be
[54:56] against
[54:59] it could not
[55:02] Prevail Hallelujah the Gates of Hell
[55:05] will fight against the Church of Jesus
[55:08] Christ but they could not
[55:10] Prevail they cannot overcome
[55:18] Church how many of you believe in Jesus
[55:21] Christ let me
[55:22] [Music]
[55:24] tell there is no hell that will
[55:27] overcome because you got a
[55:29] revation that you have a savior
[55:32] hallelujah amen that's why I'm excited
[55:34] about
[55:35] that hallelujah hallelujah if it doesn't
[55:38] excite you then I don't know what can
[55:41] excite just like right now is
[55:45] excited as we were coming she began
[55:48] crying because she was excited she was
[55:52] going to be
[55:53] Redeemed by someone who has a name
[55:56] name
[55:58] of she was going to be redeemed and
[56:00] taken
[56:02] to and she knows as long as shame is
[56:06] there no one can Prevail
[56:11] against we could suddenly say that the
[56:14] gates of hell are against marriage in
[56:18] this
[56:23] day all hell fight marriage
[56:28] the devil doesn't want young people to
[56:29] get married he want them to get to to

[57:00] head and he says go Mar go Mar you
[57:04] cannot if you try because they forced
[57:07] you it will fail it has to be a
[57:11] [Applause]
[57:13] revelation praise God is against
[57:18] it he's not against the word
[57:21] marriage but is against the
[57:24] reality what God intended marriage to
[57:29] be everybody wants to claim the word
[57:33] marriage but God is intended use of this
[57:36] sacred
[57:39] Union is what the devil would
[57:44] destroy what is God's intention of
[57:47] marriage is that the two shall become
[57:50] one will be husband and
[57:53] wife part of a union
[57:56] there only three in
[57:58] there where it is the man the woman and
[58:02] God and the rest on the
[58:04] outside but the devil has tried to make

[58:54] died where
[58:58] Chris do you know that salvation does
[59:00] not allow to do such
[59:02] things but our age is
[59:05] dying the ERS here allow me say
[59:10] it we must fight for our

[59:15] youth we should not allow this kind of
[59:18] action of

[1:03:56] uh the next we have two two more What is
[1:04:00] marriage now marriage I just want to say
[1:04:03] I usually do this on every wedding but
[1:04:05] let me just rehearse a little bit
[1:04:07] here marriage shame and
[1:04:10] favor more than a
[1:04:13] vow it is deeper than just leing
[1:04:17] together is deeper than
[1:04:20] cohabitation is richer than a physical
[1:04:22] relationship alone
[1:04:26] it is unique on
[1:04:28] Earth it is unlike any other
[1:04:32] relation any other
[1:04:34] relationship you have ever been a it is
[1:04:37] more important than any of
[1:04:40] those except one
[1:04:43] relationship my
[1:04:45] god there are many relationships on
[1:04:48] Earth but there is one which is more
[1:04:52] important than any other and that is
[1:04:55] your relationship with
[1:04:59] Christ he found you with Jesus
[1:05:02] Christ if your relationship wants to
[1:05:05] separate you with
[1:05:07] that then then that's where now
[1:05:14] now if she wants to separate you from
[1:05:17] that
[1:05:19] relationship you can think
[1:05:22] twice but apart from that relationship
[1:05:27] with Jesus Christ the second
[1:05:31] best most important
[1:05:34] relationship is this one
[1:05:36] here you have your father your mother
[1:05:40] who love you so much your sisters who
[1:05:43] are here love you so much your cousins
[1:05:46] your uncles your same thing with
[1:05:51] you even me I'm taken up with that
[1:05:55] let me tell you if I ever tell you
[1:05:59] anything and it is bring problems with
[1:06:02] your leave it take
[1:06:06] what this is the most important
[1:06:10] relationship it is important more than
[1:06:13] any
[1:06:14] other more important than any
[1:06:17] other though all these
[1:06:19] relationships your relationships with
[1:06:21] your pastors with your wife I mean with
[1:06:24] your with your sister
[1:06:27] Brothers all those ones will fail even
[1:06:30] this one will fa may fail
[1:06:32] fa but this one is the most crucial
[1:06:37] one that you'll ever be a part
[1:06:40] of is my mother
[1:06:43] here oh she is she not yet she's still
[1:06:47] outside okay so I know they streaming
[1:06:50] and they feel bad Whenever I Call on
[1:06:53] them now my
[1:06:56] mother I'm tell you
[1:06:58] this when I bought a
[1:07:01] car my mother
[1:07:03] knew
[1:07:06] woman so when I
[1:07:09] bought M I'm sorry I have to say
[1:07:11] it when

[1:18:43] 112 I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[1:18:46] Heaven and Earth because thou has hid
[1:18:48] these things from the wise and prudent
[1:18:50] and has revealed them to babies
[1:18:58] because this is a
[1:18:59] revelation you cannot learn it from a
[1:19:03] book you you even not from your
[1:19:06] parents even not from your pastor
[1:19:09] everybody has their experience and their
[1:19:14] advice but just like everything else
[1:19:18] much
[1:19:19] adice is not bested on
[1:19:23] Revelation there are many
[1:19:26] marriages on shifting signs of man
[1:19:31] wisdom don't go
[1:19:35] there someone give you a book how to be
[1:19:42] married for 50 years without a
[1:19:48] problem go and read it
[1:19:52] your that will not
[1:19:56] what works is
[1:19:59] revelation let me tell you sometimes you
[1:20:01] can be in marriage and you in hard
[1:20:04] situations problems will come they
[1:20:07] always do hinderances
[1:20:10] come but in the mid of all these things
[1:20:14] always let your ears be
[1:20:17] open what does God
[1:20:19] say we believe in Consulting God about
[1:20:22] everything we do
[1:20:25] because God answers
[1:20:27] prayer how many can say Amen to that God
[1:20:31] answers
[1:20:32] prayer so you see let your marriage be
[1:20:37] best on
[1:20:39] Revelation favor you need to go to God
[1:20:43] to find the two meanings of those
[1:20:50] wordsy submission
[1:20:54] thing with
[1:20:56] your
[1:21:00] cherish of yourself those words what do
[1:21:03] they mean God will reveal it to
[1:21:06] you and as you make your voice now in a
[1:21:11] moment don't blindly say the
[1:21:15] words but rather silently
[1:21:18] pray that God will make those words real
[1:21:21] to
[1:21:23] you whether you search out the answer of
[1:21:25] what it really means
[1:21:29] as that for this cause a man shall leave
[1:21:31] his
[1:21:33] father and shall Beed his
[1:21:36] wife and they shall be
[1:21:39] one the B say this is a great
[1:21:42] mystery and today it is still a
[1:21:45] mystery even to married couples but it
[1:21:49] won't be a
[1:21:50] mystery it
[1:21:52] won't if you seek God
[1:21:56] with all your
[1:21:57] heart the almighty God creator of the
[1:22:00] universe the of Life the give of every
[1:22:04] good

[1:55:00] amen he never gave adam two
[1:55:04] wives because they would not work

[1:55:08] easily now that is what the devil
[1:55:13] fights that is what he fights he does
[1:55:16] not want
