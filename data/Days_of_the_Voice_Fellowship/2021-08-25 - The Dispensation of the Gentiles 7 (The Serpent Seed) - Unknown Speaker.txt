[Music] and that we know that there is going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the sky that's just as sure to be as god is because it's his word [Music] lord to you in the precious name of jesus christ my name is christopher muendo my name once again is talemoa pastor at days of the voice fellowship [Music] to welcome you once again to this uh episode of the days of the voice broadcast nutella to i believe that the previous episodes have been a blessing to you again [Music] we are going to literally continue with what we've been talking about the gentle dispensation and we talked a lot about the church ages and the messengers of the gentile churches [Music] the day we are living in babies what god has done today you know how he has sent us a message through a man who would have the spirit of elijah [Music] now remember the spirit of elijah does not come on a group of people a group of men or preachers the spirit of elijah comes on a man [Music] and after he had passed off the scene then jesus vindicated him to be then the people accepted that he was elijah in his ministry where is that with brother william branham was so much used of god organ william branham yeah until today 15 years later his ministry still has an impact all over the world where is the man died more than 50 years ago considering [Music] [Music] it's not just somebody who's just coming up because he's doing miracles signs and wonders and then we just call him a prophet no the things he does must align with the promises of scripture when elijah would come soon you know who it is [Music] and here's one thing i want to say on camera hey that one this is important many mega church creatures [Music] we are not there's no way you can talk about the message and ignore the message [Music] remember that this message would not only restore us but it would not only restore us but it would also reveal and finish the mysteries [Music] [Music] and scientists are trying to research the link between man and beast science [Music] [Music] chapter 10 verse 7 days of the voice of the seventh angel [Music] begins to sound the mystery of god remember he reveals his secrets to the babes such as woodland [Music] any teaching that is taught must be able to go take us back to the cross indicators [Music] i do not believe there is anything that is revealed to us just for knowledge to be creative [Music] whatever is revealed to us is for us to get deeper into christ so the purpose of this teaching on this episode is to help you get deeper into christ the bible says [Music] why did jesus have to die on the cross right here you know do you know that when the purpose of the cross is revealed to you you will love jesus christ even more [Music] and so i might not go into the real depth of this teaching but the little things that i'm going to speak that are on my heart are meant to make you love jesus christ [Music] and so do you realize as i said earlier that on this earth today we have two different kind of seeds [Music] that cannot get lost no matter [Music] [Music] uh we're going to read quite several scriptures on this topic and i think i'll begin with genesis 3 15. between thee and the woman and between thy seed the serpent you the serpent i will put an enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed the serpent seed and her seed it shall bring thy head and that shall breathe so when the scripture here speaks of the seed of the [Music] of course many of you by now know that jesus christ came through the bloodline it is [Music] that's the [Music] in the beginning and i want you to look at a few things here before anything happens in genesis chapter 2 already [Music] made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of their garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] now last night is what i want to emphasize on and out of the ground made the lord go to grow every tree [Music] now that is every tree that is good and please and to the side of course this even continues to say that the trees that are good for food gamba so those kind of trees we are talking about are the trees that you know the physical trees that all of us know every tiffany but then there are also other types of trees [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] was he there yeah when this is the things were happening so then how were they written he had to see a vision about this he had to have a prophetic uh prophetic insight about these things to be able to write them down in the same way god would reveal it the same way nicotine like he has in our time to reveal to us these secrets that are embedded here in the description below [Music] [Music] blessed is the man that worketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the sinners nor cities in the seat of this country but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate day and night and it shall be like a tree blocked by the rivers of water that he bringeth forth his fruit in his season his life also shall not wither and whatsoever he do it shall prosper at the time [Music] [Music] so in other words the bible says tree means a man or [Music] [Music] jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life yes [Music] jesus [Music] so jesus yes is the dream of life we have found it is the tree of life bible in the book of revelation says he that shall overcome he will give of him to eat of the tree of life [Music] [Music] the bible states i believe son of man take up our lamentation upon the king of terrorists and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sensed up the sun full of wisdom and beauty and perfect in beauty thou hast been in head in the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sabias the toppers and the diamond the burial the oams the jasper the suffer the emerald days cabal and gold the workmanship of thy tablets and thy pipes were was prepared in the in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherry that covered i have said this soul thou was upon the only mountain of god thou hast walked up and down the in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that that was created till iniquity was found in the ezekiel [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so this is the so this is a created creature was on the mount of god charity in the end of the game was perfect he was cast down he he was cast down yeah he fought with the michael yeah and and he was defeated now when he was cast down now and we say that [Music] [Music] [Music] then when the evil spirit oh your movie that old circle whatever you want to call it now so when you see the tree of life [Music] the bible says [Music] now before we get into the details of what was actually done because we've had bible teachers by potatoes telling us that adam and eve ate an apple come on [Music] unto the woman you shall not surely die for god for god does know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and he shall be as gods knowing good and evil almost that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and didn't eat and gave also unto her husband with her so now we realize here that the bible says before if you add this f from this tree she ate fast without her husband [Music] then that's when she came to her husband i will not generated anybody and together the bible says they did it so now what is it that they eat have it written down here it says then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who saw eateth my flesh and drink it my plan and as eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drinking deep he that eateth my flesh and bringeth my blood dwelleth in me and i in him [Music] [Music] that everybody that believes in him must eat him yes so the people were offended of course and they left him in the japanese they never understood that the eating was not the physical eating as a vampires [Music] and that we know that there is going to be a brown and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the sky that's just as sure to be as god is because it's his word come out over my people said the lord yeah come on continue call your creeds and your self-style things i will receive yourself lord
