[55:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:14] Amen.

[55:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Please, shall we turn to our
[55:21] Bibles this evening?
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just beautiful, wonderful to
[55:27] worship the King of Kings.
[55:32] He is the Lord of Lords and he that is
[55:33] one.
[55:35] I just greet you all in the name of
[55:37] Jesus Christ.
[55:40] you once again in church.
[55:44] Can you please turn to your neighbor and
[55:45] tell them what
[55:56] we're happy to be in the house of the
[55:57] Lord?
[56:01] Brother Steven, I'm happy to see you.
[56:04] Bless you, sir.
[56:06] Amen. We are going to the book of First
[56:08] Timothy, chapter 2.
[56:14] And we are reading uh the verses we read
[56:16] on Sunday.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Chapter 2 vers uh
[56:26] 5.
[56:34] [Music]
[56:36] For this is good and acceptable in the
[56:39] sight of God our Savior, who will have
[56:42] all men to be saved and to come to the
[56:44] unto the knowledge of the truth. For
[56:47] there is one God and one mediator
[56:49] between God and men, the man Christ
[56:52] Jesus.
[57:20] Amen. Shall we say amen?
[57:23] Brother Shalom, can you come up here
[57:25] just a moment? You may be seated,
[57:26] please.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; If you look in Isaiah 43,
[57:32] and
[57:46] if you look at Isaiah 43:11,
[57:51] it says, "I even I am the Lord.
[58:00] And beside me there is no savior.
[58:07] Amen. Amen. In Isaiah 44:6,
[58:12] he says, "Thus sayaith the Lord, the
[58:14] King of Israel,
[58:17] and his redeemer, the Lord of hosts,
[58:21] I am the first
[58:24] and I am the last.
[58:26] Beside me
[58:28] there is no God.
[58:30] [Applause]
[58:32] Praise the Lord.
[58:34] And we can go on and on. Isaiah has a
[58:36] lot of these nuggets.
[58:40] And he keeps on calling himself the
[58:43] savior.
[58:46] God. So who is our savior?
[58:49] God is our savior.
[58:52] So if Jesus is our savior,
[58:56] Then that means that Jesus is God in
[58:58] flesh.
[59:00] [Music]
[59:02] Not the second God
[59:04] or the third God but the God Jehovah
[59:07] God.
[59:09] Jehovah of the Old Testament
[59:12] is the Jesus of the new
[59:15] because there is no other savior.
[59:18] There is only one savior.
[59:20] And in the Old Testament he said I am
[59:23] the savior.
[59:25] Beside me there is no other.
[59:29] And so but you know then we understand
[59:32] it is the God the Jehovah of the Old
[59:34] Testament
[59:37] who at that time was in the form of a
[59:40] spirit.
[59:43] He put on flesh
[59:46] and he dwelt among us.
[59:50] And the Bible says we beheld his glory.
[59:53] the the only glory begotten of the
[59:56] father.
[59:58] Full of grace.
[1:00:00] Oh, don't you love that?
[1:00:03] Full of unmmerited favor.
[1:00:07] Full of grace and truth. Amen. Yeah.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; And so then here in Paul tells Timothy,
[1:00:18] "For this is good
[1:00:20] and acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:00:23] Savior."
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:29] It is good and acceptable
[1:00:32] in the sight of God our savior.
[1:00:36] Have you come to watch a movie tonight?
[1:00:40] Have you come to have church tonight?
[1:00:43] Can we have church tonight?
[1:00:45] I hope we can have church on Wednesday
[1:00:47] night.
[1:00:49] Praise the Lord. For this is good and
[1:00:52] acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:00:53] savior.
[1:00:56] God our savior.
[1:00:59] Again, who is our savior?
[1:01:02] Paul emphasizes God.
[1:01:06] The man who is speaking these words He's
[1:01:10] the man who hated the Christians.
[1:01:13] He's the man who killed Christians.
[1:01:16] He's the man who hunted Christians.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; But he was a religious man.
[1:01:22] He was a Jew. He was a Pharisee. Trained
[1:01:26] among among the best of them.
[1:01:29] And he he believed in God.
[1:01:32] He believed in the God that I read to
[1:01:33] you about in the book of Isaiah.
[1:01:37] and he believed him to be the only
[1:01:38] savior.
[1:01:41] And he saw this these Christians
[1:01:45] running around with a man called Jesus
[1:01:49] and he never understood.
[1:01:51] How human being
[1:01:54] can worship another human being
[1:01:58] as if he is their savior.
[1:02:01] He couldn't understand that. So he
[1:02:04] hunted to kill them one by one.
[1:02:07] and his name was Saul.
[1:02:10] And one day as he was going to hunt
[1:02:13] them, he was with a band of soldiers.
[1:02:17] He was moving in power
[1:02:20] and great authority because he had a
[1:02:23] license to hunt and kill them.
[1:02:27] Here he meets a group of people.
[1:02:31] when he meets uh something
[1:02:35] and um when he reached this place
[1:02:39] um you know a light came from heaven
[1:02:42] what we call a priy
[1:02:46] and he recognized it because he knew
[1:02:50] that this is the same God that appeared
[1:02:52] to Moses.
[1:02:55] He had no problem with that God.
[1:02:59] He knew this is the same God
[1:03:02] that appeared to the Israelites
[1:03:05] in the desert and he had no problem with
[1:03:07] that. He knew he had appeared before in
[1:03:10] the in in the form of pill of fire.
[1:03:15] But he also knew as a Bible scholar
[1:03:21] that when Moses met that same pillar of
[1:03:23] fire,
[1:03:26] he asked a question.
[1:03:28] Who are you?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And the answer was I am who I am.
[1:03:34] So there was no answer given.
[1:03:38] So now Moses uh Paul he he knew that
[1:03:42] this is the same pit of fire that Moses
[1:03:44] made
[1:03:47] and therefore he asked the same
[1:03:49] question.
[1:03:51] And I want you to notice his words.
[1:03:54] He says who are you?
[1:03:57] He doesn't stop there. He continues, "My
[1:04:01] Lord."
[1:04:03] Hallelujah. He understood
[1:04:06] a scholar like him could not call
[1:04:08] anybody Lord.
[1:04:12] He knew Lord is the one who has control
[1:04:15] over your life.
[1:04:19] Lord is the one you worship.
[1:04:22] So he must have asked him in reverence.
[1:04:26] Who are you my Lord?
[1:04:29] And a voice came out of that pill of
[1:04:31] fire
[1:04:33] and he said, I am Jesus.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; I am Jesus.
[1:04:39] Hallelujah. Amen. The Jesus of the New
[1:04:42] Testament,
[1:04:44] the Jehovah of the Old Testament.
[1:04:48] I am Jesus.
[1:04:51] But it doesn't stop there. He did not
[1:04:54] identify himself as only Jesus
[1:04:58] but he identified himself as Jesus in
[1:05:01] his church
[1:05:05] we are talking about today. The relation
[1:05:08] the restored relationship between man
[1:05:10] and God
[1:05:15] still on our series of our true origin.
[1:05:20] He says, "I am I am Jesus."
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; He doesn't stop there. Now, now if you
[1:05:26] you're just a Bible reader without
[1:05:28] studying it, you'll just go through.
[1:05:34] But follow closely. He says, "I am Jesus
[1:05:38] whom thou persecutest."
[1:05:41] Hallelujah.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? If you understand,
[1:05:44] say, "Amen."
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[1:05:48] Did Paul ever meet Jesus
[1:05:52] physically?
[1:05:54] Did Paul ever persecute Jesus
[1:05:56] physically?
[1:05:59] No, he had not.
[1:06:02] Paul only met the disciples,
[1:06:06] people like Steven that he he commanded
[1:06:09] to be stoned.
[1:06:11] Stone him and many others.
[1:06:15] Saul met these people,
[1:06:18] persecuted them serious because they
[1:06:21] were following a man.
[1:06:24] Hallelujah.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; According to Paul,
[1:06:27] they were following a man.
[1:06:30] So he wanted to persecute themselves.
[1:06:33] But then he a voice
[1:06:36] speaks to him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:38] And he says, "I am Jesus."
[1:06:41] That was a shock.
[1:06:45] just for the voice out of the pit of
[1:06:48] fire
[1:06:49] to identify himself as Jesus.
[1:06:53] But as if that was not enough.
[1:06:57] Hallelujah. So the first phase of the
[1:06:59] revelation
[1:07:02] was that God of the Old Testament
[1:07:07] had incarnated in a man from Galilee
[1:07:09] called Jesus.
[1:07:14] It was the first phase of the
[1:07:15] revelation.
[1:07:18] And he came and he said, "Who do you say
[1:07:20] I am?
[1:07:22] What do you say I am?" And he said,
[1:07:24] "They call you, you know, so one of the
[1:07:28] prophets." But who do you say that I am?
[1:07:32] Are you following me now? And Peter by
[1:07:35] revelation
[1:07:37] said you are Jesus Christ
[1:07:40] the son of the living God.
[1:07:45] Now I want you to remember Jesus had
[1:07:48] answered had asked them this question
[1:07:51] and his question was specific.
[1:07:55] He said who do the do they say I the son
[1:07:59] of man are?
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:05] a human being.
[1:08:07] Who do they say I am?
[1:08:10] And they said they say you are one of
[1:08:12] the prophets
[1:08:14] either Isaiah, Jeremiah or one of them
[1:08:17] just like any other prophet cuz you're a
[1:08:20] human being. So they say you are one of
[1:08:22] the prophets.
[1:08:24] Are you following me?
[1:08:26] Keep your thoughts together because God
[1:08:30] kept on using prophets.
[1:08:33] Don't miss this now. He kept on using
[1:08:35] prophets
[1:08:38] every generation. Moses, Elijah,
[1:08:41] Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah. They were
[1:08:45] prophets born out from among us,
[1:08:50] but anointed by God
[1:08:52] to prophesy or speak on behalf of God.
[1:08:57] So the apostle said
[1:08:59] they think you are one of the prophets
[1:09:05] because you are speaking on behalf of
[1:09:07] God.
[1:09:10] But the other prophets
[1:09:13] they all when they were prophesying they
[1:09:15] said thus saith the Lord.
[1:09:21] and Peter by revelation
[1:09:24] were able to see and understand
[1:09:27] that Jesus never spoke that way.
[1:09:32] Yes, he was a prophet but he was more
[1:09:35] than a prophet
[1:09:36] because he never said the Lord.
[1:09:40] He said verily verily I say unto you.
[1:09:43] Hallelujah.
[1:09:47] So this is more than a pro.
[1:09:50] So Peter by revelation
[1:09:52] Jesus said who do they say I the son of
[1:09:54] man?
[1:09:57] But Peter by revelation
[1:09:59] he said you are not just a son of man.
[1:10:02] You are a son of God.
[1:10:05] Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] Did you get it? Because Peter answered
[1:10:09] and said
[1:10:11] you are Jesus Christ.
[1:10:15] son of a living.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; You cannot be a son of God without being
[1:10:22] God.
[1:10:25] Hallelujah. Amen. In other words, I was
[1:10:29] saying
[1:10:31] God in
[1:10:34] you are the embodiment of God on earth.
[1:10:39] Everything that God was
[1:10:43] powered in you
[1:10:46] and Jesus
[1:10:48] said flesh and blood
[1:10:52] revealed this
[1:10:54] but my father in heaven
[1:10:57] revelation.
[1:10:58] I will build my church
[1:11:01] of hell shall not prevail.
[1:11:05] The church of Jesus must come back into
[1:11:08] relationship with God
[1:11:11] by spiritual revelation
[1:11:15] of who God is.
[1:11:18] Thereby they will know who they are.
[1:11:23] Now here Jesus now is speaking with Paul
[1:11:29] before he became Paul and and the voice
[1:11:32] out of the pit of fire
[1:11:35] says I am Jesus
[1:11:38] you remember that revelation
[1:11:40] for the voice to call himself Jesus
[1:11:44] it meant he's God himself
[1:11:48] he had already given the revelation when
[1:11:49] he
[1:12:46] No, for there is one God
[1:12:49] and one mediator between God and man,
[1:12:52] the man Christ Jesus.
[1:12:55] Talking about the chasm,
[1:12:57] there was no one able
[1:12:59] There was no one worthy
[1:13:02] to bridge this.
[1:13:06] There had to be one.
[1:13:09] And now we read in Revelation 5
[1:13:13] where I told him the lion of the tribe
[1:13:15] of Judah prevail.
[1:13:18] But see this is the same scripture here
[1:13:22] that says for there is one God
[1:13:25] and one mediator between God and man.
[1:13:29] Okay, before I continue on that, you
[1:13:31] look at Revelation 5
[1:13:34] where he says, "The lion of the tribe of
[1:13:36] Judah has prevailed."
[1:13:40] And when John turned to see,
[1:13:42] he did not see a lion.
[1:13:45] But he saw a lamb
[1:13:47] and this lamp was as slain before the
[1:13:50] foundation of the world.
[1:13:55] Then brother Bam said then out of that
[1:13:58] I can preach God in simplicity.
[1:14:04] You know God in simplicity.
[1:14:07] God hides himself in simplicity
[1:14:11] revealing himself in the sand.
[1:14:14] Praise the name of the Lord. Which
[1:14:17] simplicity?
[1:14:19] First Timothy 2 5.
[1:14:24] This is the simplicity of God.
[1:14:29] There is one God, one mediator,
[1:14:33] one man who could bring the chasm
[1:14:38] between God and
[1:14:42] he said who is it? Who is it? The man.
[1:14:47] Everybody say the man.
[1:14:50] The man
[1:14:52] Christ Jesus.
[1:14:55] Now here is not talking about his deity.
[1:15:03] God had to become man.
[1:15:07] And when he when he says God became man,
[1:15:09] it means God literally became you.
[1:15:16] He humbled himself. Yes.
[1:15:19] In the book of Philippians chapter 2,
[1:15:22] he he says, "Let this mind be in you
[1:15:26] as also it was in Christ Jesus
[1:15:31] who being in the form of God
[1:15:36] did not rob to be equal with God.
[1:15:41] He humbled himself
[1:15:44] in a form of a
[1:15:48] because he was found
[1:15:50] in a fashion as a man,
[1:15:54] he humbled himself to the death of the
[1:15:56] cross.
[1:16:00] And yet he was God himself.
[1:16:03] And because he was formed as a human
[1:16:05] being,
[1:16:08] he humbled himself and he accepted to
[1:16:11] die. Can you imagine God dying in
[1:16:16] why did he do that? He died so that he
[1:16:19] can bring the chasm.
[1:16:23] All the redeemed of the Lord
[1:16:27] will now cross over.
[1:16:30] All of them would cross over.
[1:16:33] Hallelujah.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Where would they cross back to?
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, brother,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; where were they crossing back to?
[1:16:44] Crossing back into the glory of God.
[1:16:49] The Bible said that all men have sinned
[1:16:53] and all have come short of the glory of
[1:16:55] God.
[1:16:58] My very last scripture says
[1:17:01] one
[1:17:03] 26 even the mystery which has been hid
[1:17:06] from ages
[1:17:09] and from generations
[1:17:12] now it is made manifest
[1:17:15] not to everybody but to the saint
[1:17:19] hallelujah to the saint who is a saint
[1:17:24] saint is a blood washed redeemed amen
[1:17:27] forgiven saved child of
[1:17:36] It has been made manifest.
[1:17:39] There's a mystery which has been hidden.
[1:17:43] But now has been made manifest
[1:17:47] to his saints.
[1:17:50] to whom the saints God would make known
[1:17:57] that is the riches
[1:17:59] the riches
[1:18:01] riches
[1:18:03] glory
[1:18:06] meaning his glory
[1:18:09] so rich
[1:18:11] his glory is so richer
[1:18:14] than golder
[1:18:16] than money that's why he's
[1:18:21] of me
[1:18:24] in the fire
[1:18:25] without money without
[1:18:30] believing by accepting.
[1:18:33] Amen. The riches of the glory of this
[1:18:37] mystery among the Gentiles
[1:18:42] which is
[1:18:44] Christ in you.
[1:18:50] hope of glory.
[1:18:55] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] This is the purpose
[1:19:02] of the opening of the seven.
[1:19:08] What I just told you right now
[1:19:11] is the reason why the message is
[1:19:14] different from all the other
[1:19:19] We have a mystery
[1:19:21] that is unveiled among us.
[1:19:26] May God open your spiritual mind
[1:19:32] to understand
[1:19:35] the things I'm talking about.
[1:19:38] Maybe you want to go back and listen to
[1:19:39] them.
[1:19:41] I'm sure many of you have missed a few
[1:19:43] things.
[1:19:46] Then he told John, "Don't be
[1:19:47] brokenhearted.
[1:19:49] Don't weep for the lion of the tribe of
[1:19:52] Judah.
[1:19:53] The offspring of David,
[1:19:55] he has prevailed. The lion and the root
[1:19:58] of David
[1:20:00] has prevailed
[1:20:03] has overcome."
[1:20:05] And on Sunday, we talked much about
[1:20:07] that.
[1:20:09] Amen. We talked about the root of David
[1:20:12] prevailing.
[1:20:17] and talk about
[1:20:25] overcoming.
[1:20:26] Are you following me now? Amen. So he
[1:20:29] fought and he overcame and he prevailed.
[1:20:35] Amen. So I don't have to fight.
[1:20:39] Hallelujah. In that sense,
[1:20:44] I don't have to overcome.
[1:20:46] In that sense,
[1:20:50] knowing that he fought
[1:20:54] and overcame
[1:20:56] he fought for who? Not for himself.
[1:21:00] I don't have to die
[1:21:02] in that sense.
[1:21:05] Why? Because he died for himself.
[1:21:10] He died for you.
[1:21:14] He overcame for you. He fought for you.
[1:21:18] He for you. He did not do all that as
[1:21:22] God
[1:21:24] did it as a human being.
[1:21:28] Do you understand
[1:21:30] that Jesus had his own will
[1:21:35] as a man? He didn't want to die.
[1:21:39] He feared the cross.
[1:21:41] He feared death
[1:21:44] to the extent. He actually went and
[1:21:47] prayed.
[1:21:48] He said, "Father, if it is possible,
[1:21:52] take away this."
[1:21:57] He realized the prayer was not answered.
[1:22:01] He said not according to my will
[1:22:06] according to your will.
[1:22:10] So there was the will of the father and
[1:22:12] there was the will of the son
[1:22:16] and the son's will was not to die.
[1:22:23] Why? Because he was a representation
[1:22:27] of you and me.
[1:22:31] Brother said, God struck him
[1:22:35] and when he was at the cross, he cried.
[1:22:39] He said, "My father, my father,
[1:22:42] have you forsaken me?"
[1:22:45] And he said, "God, turn the other side."
[1:22:50] He didn't look at him.
[1:22:52] Why? Remember that was you.
[1:22:59] And when we talk about the son,
[1:23:02] remember Jesus was both 100% God and
[1:23:07] 100% man.
[1:23:11] So here we talk about two different God.
[1:23:15] But as a son, he was a human being with
[1:23:19] his own will
[1:23:21] flesh and blooded
[1:23:23] with everything you are tempted with.
[1:23:26] Amen. He overcame
[1:23:30] never was overcome.
[1:23:32] That's why he is our savior. That's why
[1:23:35] he's our redeemer.
[1:23:37] He prevailed
[1:23:39] over sickness. He prevailed.
[1:23:45] the grave
[1:23:48] fear sickness every demon over the hell
[1:23:53] and the grave
[1:23:55] hell the grave
[1:23:58] power over him.
[1:24:01] That's why the Bible calls him the
[1:24:02] mighty conqueror.
[1:24:05] He conquered everything
[1:24:08] conquered everywhere.
[1:24:10] conquered
[1:24:17] mighty.
[1:24:20] Hallelujah. So you cannot depend on
[1:24:22] yourself.
[1:24:24] You have to know that there is one
[1:24:31] that you might attain
[1:24:34] all the victory.
[1:24:37] Hallelujah. He did everything for me.
[1:24:41] To remain a loser, not to remain a
[1:24:43] sinner, not to remain a poor man,
[1:24:47] remain a manful
[1:24:50] man,
[1:24:53] not to remain a fornicator,
[1:24:55] but he did everything for me. Amen. That
[1:24:58] I might
[1:25:00] all the victory
[1:25:03] he won for me.
[1:25:06] Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] Thank you.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; He overcame as man.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; He prevailed as man.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; That's the simplicity
[1:25:22] of God.
[1:25:26] Amen. Prevail means rest and overcome.
[1:25:31] Amen. And brother Bam talks about the
[1:25:33] garden of Gethsemane
[1:25:35] when blood dropped down out of his face.
[1:25:38] [Music]
[1:25:39] He was overcoming.
[1:25:42] I'm so glad that you overcame.
[1:25:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; And now in Revelation
[1:25:50] 10, I just pray that we in this few
[1:25:51] minutes we we finish up this so next
[1:25:55] time we go on another.
[1:25:59] I not said 10. I said in a few minutes.
[1:26:03] Okay. Now, it says, "And I saw another
[1:26:04] mighty angel coming down from heaven
[1:26:09] clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was
[1:26:11] upon his head, and his face was as it
[1:26:14] were the sun, and his feet as the
[1:26:17] pillars of fire. And he had in his hand
[1:26:22] a little book open.
[1:26:25] And he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:26:28] and his left foot on the earth.
[1:26:33] And now
[1:26:34] you know of course it says that when he
[1:26:36] had uttered his voice, seven thunders
[1:26:38] uttered their voices.
[1:26:43] And um and he was about to write
[1:26:46] and then the voice said, "Sal up those
[1:26:48] things
[1:26:51] and write them not."
[1:26:54] But then on verse seven he says but in
[1:26:57] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:26:59] angel.
[1:27:01] You see now I want you to see the
[1:27:03] importance
[1:27:05] of the seventh angel. This is the reason
[1:27:08] even why we call our church days of the
[1:27:10] voice fellowship
[1:27:16] in the days of the voice
[1:27:18] of the seventh.
[1:27:21] Remember the mysteries were sealed up.
[1:27:26] They were sealed up,
[1:27:28] right? And and and and John was not
[1:27:31] permitted to write it.
[1:27:34] These are the same mysteries. The same
[1:27:36] mystery which was also sealed up in the
[1:27:37] days of Daniel.
[1:27:42] He saw but then you know God spoke to
[1:27:45] him and said seal it up.
[1:27:49] But now here he says, "But in the days
[1:27:51] of the voice
[1:27:53] of the seventh angel, it shall begin to
[1:27:56] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:27:59] finished."
[1:28:02] Amen. So the mystery of God
[1:28:05] will not be finished
[1:28:07] until the sounding
[1:28:10] of the seventh angel.
[1:28:13] So you see the mysteries remain sealed.
[1:28:19] And when you talk about the mystery of
[1:28:20] God,
[1:28:22] yes, you are talking about the Godhead.
[1:28:27] And you know when you talk about the
[1:28:29] Godhead,
[1:28:30] follow me now closely. When you talk
[1:28:33] about the Godhead,
[1:28:35] you cannot you you are talking about the
[1:28:37] bride as well, the church.
[1:28:42] So by unveiling the mystery of the
[1:28:44] godhead,
[1:28:47] You are also unveiling the mystery of
[1:28:50] the bride.
[1:28:54] Let me put it this way. By unveiling who
[1:28:58] God is,
[1:29:01] you are also unveiling who the church,
[1:29:04] the true vine, the true church is
[1:29:10] and what she stands for.
[1:29:13] Because you see this reveals all the
[1:29:15] mysteries about
[1:29:21] praise God.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; So now here in the bridge, brother says
[1:29:27] the mystery of this seven sealed book
[1:29:31] will be revealed at the sounding of the
[1:29:34] seventh church angels message.
[1:29:41] The seventh angel begins to sound
[1:29:45] and there is the messages wrought out
[1:29:47] there
[1:29:50] and we got it on tape and book form.
[1:29:55] Listen church. The denominations
[1:29:59] cannot understand the mystery of God.
[1:30:04] They cannot. They cannot because that
[1:30:09] mystery of God
[1:30:12] will remain a mystery
[1:30:15] until the coming of the seventh angel's
[1:30:18] message.
[1:30:21] It is the message of the seventh angel
[1:30:25] which is the last day messenger,
[1:30:29] the last prophet to the Gentiles,
[1:30:32] the one also who will fulfill Malachi
[1:30:34] 4:5.
[1:30:36] that will actually you open the mystery.
[1:30:43] Follow me closely.
[1:30:45] His message is so important
[1:30:47] that without it
[1:30:50] the whole world
[1:30:53] will not have the mystery of God.
[1:30:58] And when I say the mystery of God,
[1:31:01] it doesn't mean they will have they will
[1:31:03] have a little revelation.
[1:31:07] But they will never truly understand
[1:31:11] like Jesus said in seeing they might see
[1:31:15] but they will not understand
[1:31:19] in in in revelation in revelation 3 he
[1:31:22] says that they they you know they are
[1:31:25] blind
[1:31:26] but they don't know it that they will
[1:31:29] take the word the Bible
[1:31:32] they will preach on one god God
[1:31:35] rather instead of teaching on one God,
[1:31:38] they will pick the trinity
[1:31:41] is what they see here.
[1:31:44] In saying they might see but they will
[1:31:47] not understand.
[1:31:50] They will preach water baptism
[1:31:53] into into the trinity
[1:31:56] infant baptisms.
[1:31:58] They will accept women preachers in
[1:31:59] their churches.
[1:32:01] They will not have church order in their
[1:32:02] churches.
[1:32:05] Why? They are blind and they don't know.
[1:32:09] So you can't tell them they are blind
[1:32:11] because they will tell you no we are
[1:32:12] not.
[1:32:16] And isn't this the condition of the
[1:32:17] denomination?
[1:32:21] They don't think they are blind.
[1:32:24] They think they are increased with goods
[1:32:26] and have need of nothing.
[1:32:30] They tell don't preach to us. Preach to
[1:32:31] others.
[1:32:33] They are blind but they don't know.
[1:32:38] You see
[1:32:40] great is the mystery of
[1:32:45] follow me closely
[1:32:48] for pray for me here now very important
[1:32:50] moment here for us. We need to
[1:32:52] understand
[1:32:54] which time we are living in
[1:32:57] what is happening here.
[1:33:00] We are not here to start another church.
[1:33:04] God is done with the business of
[1:33:06] churches starting.
[1:33:11] He's out of the churches.
[1:33:14] And when I say churches, I mean the
[1:33:16] denominations,
[1:33:21] you know them by name.
[1:33:24] And their entire mind was to building a
[1:33:28] denomination.
[1:33:31] We are here. We in in in this city that
[1:33:35] we that in that city
[1:33:38] and so we are big data
[1:33:41] and the government will respect them.
[1:33:43] They will have a voice and then a man on
[1:33:46] top will will be the one on the
[1:33:48] headquarters.
[1:33:52] God is done with
[1:33:54] God is out of the denomination.
[1:33:58] He vomited it out long time ago.
[1:34:01] But what is it doing now?
[1:34:04] It's your business
[1:34:07] calling his bride.
[1:34:10] Come out of the denomination
[1:34:13] to come up
[1:34:16] to a higher revelation,
[1:34:20] higher dimension
[1:34:22] to understand who God is.
[1:34:26] Thereby receiving a revelation of who
[1:34:28] you are
[1:34:31] and knowing for sure.
[1:34:34] You are going to walk into
[1:34:37] the reality of where you came from.
[1:34:43] You came from God. You go back.
[1:34:47] The seventh angel begins to sound.
[1:34:51] And there is a message wrought out.
[1:34:55] And we have it in books and tapes. So if
[1:34:58] you're not reading the books
[1:35:01] and if you're not listening to the text,
[1:35:04] can I say this now? Let us settle this
[1:35:07] here.
[1:35:09] You are not a message believer.
[1:35:18] You can believe it or you you may choose
[1:35:20] not to believe it. the truth.
[1:35:23] Just like I would say if you are not
[1:35:26] reading the Bible,
[1:35:28] you are not a Christian.
[1:35:36] This seventh angel messenger
[1:35:40] is not coming for everybody.
[1:35:43] Remember, it is not about him.
[1:35:47] He's only coming.
[1:35:50] Amen. with a book which is already open.
[1:35:55] He's sounding from an open book
[1:35:59] and he says we have it in books and
[1:36:01] tapes.
[1:36:06] So the message believers
[1:36:08] will feed on them.
[1:36:11] Revelation 8:10
[1:36:13] uh 7:11 rather 8-11
[1:36:17] he says
[1:36:19] take the book the open book
[1:36:23] and eat it up
[1:36:26] who John so if you are not eating the
[1:36:30] book
[1:36:32] you are not John
[1:36:34] now can all of us agree with that
[1:36:37] if you are not eating the book you are
[1:36:40] not John because the voice told John
[1:36:43] take
[1:36:45] out from the hand of the seven
[1:36:49] eat it up
[1:36:51] and prophesy again. So if you are not
[1:36:53] eating the book you are not John and a
[1:36:57] prophet said John is a type of the
[1:36:59] bride.
[1:37:03] Let us not waste our time
[1:37:07] with this with with you know a less
[1:37:10] important thing.
[1:37:13] It is good to listen to other preachers.
[1:37:16] It's all right to do it on occasion
[1:37:20] but I tell you friends
[1:37:22] have you listened to the message?
[1:37:26] Come to your home church. Listen to your
[1:37:28] pastor preaching.
[1:37:31] Go back home. Read your Bible and listen
[1:37:33] to the message.
[1:37:38] The problem with message believers,
[1:37:41] we love listening to our preachers and
[1:37:44] their interpretation of the message
[1:37:46] until wrong doctrines are crept in.
[1:37:58] I would have loved it better
[1:38:01] if I can preach something here
[1:38:04] and someone will come to me after church
[1:38:06] service.
[1:38:08] I tell you, pastor, you say it this way,
[1:38:10] but the messenger says it this way.
[1:38:15] And I will say, wow, I never
[1:38:18] will correct it. I would love it.
[1:38:22] Message believers
[1:38:24] believe the message of the hour.
[1:38:28] Hallelujah.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Now at the beginning of the sounding of
[1:38:34] the message,
[1:38:37] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:38:41] at that time. Now we will notice the
[1:38:44] book of the mystery of God is not
[1:38:45] revealed until the seventh angel's
[1:38:48] message is found.
[1:38:55] Can we all say amen to this?
[1:38:58] It is not revealed
[1:39:01] until the seventh angel's message is
[1:39:03] sounded
[1:39:07] white rider.
[1:39:10] a white horse right there going forth to
[1:39:13] right and everybody said oh that is
[1:39:16] Jesus conquering the whole world
[1:39:21] and they were like that along with that
[1:39:24] they believe the trinity
[1:39:27] three gods they believed in worship of
[1:39:30] Mary and other things
[1:39:33] but when the seventh angel messenger
[1:39:35] came
[1:39:40] That is not Jesus.
[1:39:42] That is Satan.
[1:39:46] That is Satan.
[1:39:49] Why is it Satan? He has a bow, but he
[1:39:52] has no arrow.
[1:39:56] What does it mean?
[1:39:58] He can't kill nobody.
[1:40:01] Hallelujah. By exposing Satan,
[1:40:06] he's revealing Jesus Christ.
[1:40:09] And by revealing Jesus Christ, he's
[1:40:12] revealing the bride,
[1:40:15] then you get to know who you are.
[1:40:18] Because whenever the the the enemy comes
[1:40:20] in like a fly,
[1:40:23] the spirit of God raises a standard.
[1:40:28] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:40:31] Now, it is a book, a mysterious book.
[1:40:35] It is a book of redemption.
[1:40:38] And he says, "We'll get into it a little
[1:40:39] while."
[1:40:41] And now, this book of redemption will
[1:40:42] not be thoroughly understood. It is
[1:40:44] progged in through the church ages.
[1:40:50] But at the end, when the seventh angel
[1:40:52] begins to sound his,
[1:40:57] he winds up all of those loose ends. and
[1:41:00] these fellows proved arts.
[1:41:05] Let me help you church.
[1:41:08] The things we preach in this message of
[1:41:09] the hour,
[1:41:12] we are not the first to preach them.
[1:41:15] The apostles were the first.
[1:41:17] The message has nothing new.
[1:41:21] That's the truth.
[1:41:24] And all the other denominations
[1:41:27] have a lot of truths.
[1:41:31] a lot of truth.
[1:41:33] By the way, all the things
[1:41:37] others preach before him,
[1:41:42] not only those in the Bible, but
[1:41:44] throughout the church ages.
[1:41:48] But you see the idea is
[1:41:51] none none preached the whole council of
[1:41:54] the word.
[1:42:00] You find one with this truth,
[1:42:03] one with preaching predestination
[1:42:07] but is wrong on the other other things.
[1:42:10] One here preaching on on eternal
[1:42:12] security
[1:42:15] but wrong on other things. One here
[1:42:18] preaching baptism in Jesus name
[1:42:23] but wrong on other.
[1:42:26] one year preaching no women preachers
[1:42:29] but wrong another.
[1:42:33] That's right. Did you know the Roman
[1:42:36] Catholic Church has a lot of truth?
[1:42:41] Did you know
[1:42:44] that the Roman Catholic Church
[1:42:46] preaches and believes
[1:42:49] they don't believe in polygamy?
[1:42:54] Did you know they don't believe in
[1:42:57] ordaining a woman priest?
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:02] They have no woman bishop.
[1:43:06] So the next time somebody tells you,
[1:43:08] "Oh, you're a cult."
[1:43:11] But even other churches preaching,
[1:43:15] it's not the truth that has started with
[1:43:16] us.
[1:43:19] It's been here a long time.
[1:43:22] Others preach the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:23] Spirit and they wrong on everything
[1:43:25] else.
[1:43:28] But then the message of the hour
[1:43:31] brings and ties all the loose ends
[1:43:36] and summarizes the whole thing
[1:43:40] brings a full package to the bride.
[1:43:45] Nothing will perfect the bride,
[1:43:48] but a perfect word.
[1:43:52] And a perfect word will only be come by
[1:43:55] the seventh messenger,
[1:44:00] not a fifth, sixth.
[1:44:03] Seven is completion.
[1:44:06] God is trying to say I'm completing now
[1:44:10] my church
[1:44:13] summing it all up.
[1:44:15] doing a final work
[1:44:19] for the rapture. Now
[1:44:22] you see the things we are preaching,
[1:44:25] don't ever think it is exclusive to us
[1:44:27] only.
[1:44:30] You will go somewhere and you find them
[1:44:31] preaching it the way you you believe it.
[1:44:36] Not everything but one of the things
[1:44:37] they believe
[1:44:40] and then you will think ah they are
[1:44:42] reading brother Bham. No some of them
[1:44:45] are not
[1:44:48] but is that a truth they had
[1:44:52] but wrong on everything else
[1:44:54] throughout the church ages
[1:44:57] proved that this revelation
[1:45:01] they have probed they have like tried to
[1:45:03] get into it.
[1:45:07] But the the seventh angel messenger
[1:45:09] comes and winds up the whole world
[1:45:14] and it reveals the entire revelation of
[1:45:16] God.
[1:45:19] Then the God and everything else is
[1:45:21] settled. The Godhead and everything else
[1:45:23] is settled.
[1:45:26] All the mysteries, serpent seed and
[1:45:28] whatever more is to be revealed.
[1:45:33] Oh my. I have no time listening to a
[1:45:37] preacher with half truth.
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:41] But I have all my time to listen to the
[1:45:45] message of the hour,
[1:45:47] the full final council of truth in our
[1:45:50] generation.
[1:45:55] Hallelujah. You find believers wasting
[1:45:58] time with tele evangelist.
[1:46:03] Oh brother, you don't know what you're
[1:46:05] you're believing in your name.
[1:46:08] Come to another dimension.
[1:46:12] And he says, I'm not just making that
[1:46:14] up. It is the
[1:46:19] book holds a mystery of the names of
[1:46:21] those supposed to be sealed.
[1:46:33] has the names of those people that will
[1:46:34] be saved. The book holds that mystery
[1:46:38] and the book is unfolding it now.
[1:46:42] Not each one's name, but what a mystery
[1:46:45] of the book is
[1:46:48] why is calling those names.
[1:46:51] You finally understand that now when you
[1:46:53] when the when the unfolding of the
[1:46:55] mystery happened,
[1:46:59] You hear your name being
[1:47:04] the book doesn't say leave
[1:47:07] [Music]
[1:47:09] Solomon.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't say that
[1:47:14] the mystery.
[1:47:16] It unfolds the mystery of what? The
[1:47:18] thing is
[1:47:20] but we ourselves by faith we believe it.
[1:47:25] Okay. Now in a few moments let me try to
[1:47:27] summarize and
[1:47:30] I wanted to read for you 2 Corinthians
[1:47:31] 11
[1:47:33] where Paul says would to God be ye could
[1:47:36] bear with me a little in my folly and
[1:47:38] indeed bear with me.
[1:47:41] For I am jealous over you with godly
[1:47:43] jealousy.
[1:47:45] I have exposed you to one husband
[1:47:49] that I may present you to as a chest
[1:47:51] virgin to Christ.
[1:47:55] But I fear that lest by any means as the
[1:47:56] serpent beguiled Eve
[1:48:01] through his subility,
[1:48:04] so your mind should be corrupted from
[1:48:05] the from the simplicity that is in
[1:48:07] Christ.
[1:48:11] For if he that cometh preaches another
[1:48:13] Jesus,
[1:48:16] whom we have not preached,
[1:48:18] or if you receive another spirit
[1:48:21] which you have not received or another
[1:48:24] gospel which you have not accepted, he
[1:48:28] might well bear with him.
[1:48:31] Paul here is trying to define his job
[1:48:37] to estab his job was to establish the
[1:48:40] relationship between God and man
[1:48:47] to accomplish what Jesus came to do.
[1:48:51] Let me put it this way
[1:48:53] and this is the purpose of this message
[1:48:56] because Paul, brother Bham says I
[1:48:58] preached what Paul preached.
[1:49:03] The angel come revelation five,
[1:49:08] you know there is no one to bridge the
[1:49:09] chasm
[1:49:12] sin to redeem the fallen man
[1:49:16] but the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:49:17] prevail
[1:49:19] what what happens we see in revelation
[1:49:22] 10 revelation 5 he takes the book it's
[1:49:25] worth it
[1:49:27] open the mystery but in Revelation 10 is
[1:49:31] now coming down as a mighty angel in his
[1:49:36] right hand with a a little book of
[1:49:41] you see it doesn't go to every believer
[1:49:45] in every generation.
[1:49:47] What does it do? He says this book
[1:49:52] may God help you to see.
[1:49:55] Brother Bam now says throughout the ages
[1:50:00] the the the ministers the preachers
[1:50:04] have tried to probe into it.
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:09] But the fullness of it,
[1:50:13] full revelation of it
[1:50:17] now comes only when the seventh angel
[1:50:21] messenger comes.
[1:50:26] Wait, the seventh angel messenger
[1:50:31] doesn't start the unfolding of the
[1:50:34] mystery.
[1:50:39] He finishes
[1:50:43] the unfolding of the
[1:50:46] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:50:48] seven when he begins to sound the
[1:50:51] mystery
[1:50:52] will be finished.
[1:50:55] And now in the days of the seventh angel
[1:50:59] messenger. He takes the open book
[1:51:02] and finishes the mystery.
[1:51:05] Ties all the loose ends to me.
[1:51:09] And what does he do by that?
[1:51:12] Then is an instruction by God to the
[1:51:16] bride
[1:51:19] to the seed in every generation.
[1:51:22] Take the book.
[1:51:24] Eat it up. Receive the word. Believe the
[1:51:28] word. accepted it in your
[1:51:39] proof
[1:51:41] that someone has the Holy Ghost
[1:51:44] in every age is by receiving the word of
[1:51:47] their day.
[1:51:50] What does it show that they are the seed
[1:51:53] of God?
[1:51:56] because they are on the other side of
[1:51:58] the chasm.
[1:52:01] They can only cross over
[1:52:05] by the shed blood.
[1:52:08] But this shed blood is in the form of
[1:52:11] the open word.
[1:52:15] Those who will accept it, those who will
[1:52:17] believe it,
[1:52:19] they will cross over.
[1:52:23] Where will they be going?
[1:52:25] They will be going back again to the
[1:52:28] image
[1:52:30] that they lost in the beginning.
[1:52:34] The mediator,
[1:52:36] the mediation work
[1:52:39] of Jesus Christ continues with the
[1:52:42] message of the hour.
[1:52:47] He did it on the cross.
[1:52:49] But then that alone
[1:52:52] cannot save you by saying I believe in
[1:52:54] what he did in the cross. But you stop
[1:52:56] there.
[1:53:00] Many have done that. And those are the
[1:53:02] ones we call Christians.
[1:53:05] But they are not going in the rapture.
[1:53:08] All of them. It's only those who truly
[1:53:12] receive the word
[1:53:17] in their day.
[1:53:20] the revealed open.
[1:53:24] So when they receive it, then the seed
[1:53:27] in them
[1:53:29] is quickened.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. My time is up. I just
[1:53:39] want to
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; I wanted to finish this but I don't
[1:53:41] think I am going to.
[1:53:45] But we see that this relationship
[1:53:49] between God and man
[1:53:51] cannot be restored
[1:53:54] until the full word
[1:53:58] has been brought back.
[1:54:01] You see the believers.
[1:54:05] Let me begin with with the Jews.
[1:54:09] God is God is wonderful.
[1:54:12] He has ways he does things.
[1:54:15] the the Jews because you know because of
[1:54:18] unbelief he turned away from them and he
[1:54:22] blinded them
[1:54:24] and salvation goes to the Gentiles.
[1:54:29] What will happen to them?
[1:54:31] Those who were executed and killed
[1:54:34] and henchmen
[1:54:37] old Nazi Germany.
[1:54:41] These are the ones we see
[1:54:44] under the I think it is the fifth seal
[1:54:48] souls under the army.
[1:54:51] They are given white robes.
[1:54:54] They they are given grace because they
[1:54:56] would have received it but they did not
[1:54:58] because their eyes were blinded.
[1:55:01] [Music]
[1:55:09] And we see those in the days of of of of
[1:55:11] Luther,
[1:55:14] you know, they the bride, those who
[1:55:16] received Luther's message,
[1:55:19] but Luther smoked a pipe.
[1:55:23] He did. And his people did
[1:55:27] baptize in father, son, holy spirit.
[1:55:30] But to God that didn't matter.
[1:55:34] because it was not the time for the
[1:55:36] fullness of the revelation to come.
[1:55:41] But Peter, but Luther received the seed
[1:55:46] for that time,
[1:55:50] probed onto it
[1:55:54] shall live by faith.
[1:55:56] That's all the revelation God allowed
[1:55:58] them to see.
[1:56:01] And when they received it,
[1:56:03] It so quickened them
[1:56:06] that they received the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:08] What? What?
[1:56:11] Yes.
[1:56:14] For they received the portion of the
[1:56:16] Holy Ghost
[1:56:19] according to the revelation of the word
[1:56:21] they had in their name.
[1:56:31] Trity
[1:56:34] didn't matter to God
[1:56:37] is that the revelation which was powered
[1:56:39] out in their day. Hallelujah.
[1:56:46] They received it accepted it and then
[1:56:50] comes and then all the others. But now
[1:56:55] we are living in the final age.
[1:56:59] We have no excuse.
[1:57:03] We are the Omega bride.
[1:57:06] Everything is finished in our
[1:57:09] generation.
[1:57:11] Therefore, we cannot settle for less.
[1:57:17] We have to receive all the revelation
[1:57:21] all the world not a part of the world.
[1:57:26] Hallelujah.
[1:57:28] And brother Bham said this is the age I
[1:57:30] would have loved to live in.
[1:57:34] Oh friends, there are many things I can
[1:57:35] say
[1:57:37] and many things I want to say but we
[1:57:40] only cut short by time. I tell you
[1:57:43] friends this is more than a religion.
[1:57:48] is more than just speaking one one part
[1:57:50] of the message and running with it
[1:57:53] [Applause]
[1:57:55] and then you make a camp around it.
[1:57:59] We are coming into a place a time
[1:58:03] when the seed is ripening.
[1:58:08] Hallelujah. And the harvest is
[1:58:11] happening.
[1:58:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:16] It's a final work of redemption.
[1:58:19] It's a final season.
[1:58:22] We have to mature.
[1:58:24] The other seed will mature. The the
[1:58:26] tires will mature
[1:58:28] and manifest themselves
[1:58:30] and the seed will mature
[1:58:33] and manifest.
[1:58:36] I didn't finish up. God bless you. Just
[1:58:38] stand up on your feet.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, I'll tell you what the
[1:58:43] word is just so so wonderful.
[1:58:46] There's a lot that God wants us to get
[1:58:49] into.
[1:58:51] Only if we can.
[1:58:55] Amen. Only if we can. You see, there's
[1:58:57] nothing we can do to for the tires.
[1:59:03] Completely nothing.
[1:59:05] But also, there's nothing they can do to
[1:59:07] us.
[1:59:11] We can never bring them into a saving
[1:59:13] relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1:59:18] They can never destroy us.
[1:59:22] We've got the power.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; We've got the power.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.

[1:59:46] in the name of Jesus.
[1:59:51] We've got the power

[2:00:06] defeated.

[2:00:13] in the name of the Lord.
[2:00:17] Now give me your hand.
[2:00:20] Let's agree together
[2:00:24] that all our eneies
[2:00:28] will crumble at our feet.
[2:00:31] Whatever we bind on earth shall be bound
[2:00:36] in heaven
[2:00:38] at the name of Jesus.
[2:00:42] Satan has to flee. Oh, we call the power
[2:00:49] in the name of Jesus.

[2:03:13] for your word Lord and that you have
[2:03:16] opened to us in this day.
[2:03:19] Help us Lord and take us deeper,
[2:03:22] deeper in revelation,
[2:03:25] deeper Lord in us knowing who we are
[2:03:29] that we might understand
[2:03:31] what you have done for us is a perfect
[2:03:33] work,
[2:03:36] Lord. And we may not look back to the
[2:03:38] past,
[2:03:40] but we may look to what you are doing
[2:03:42] through us and in us,
[2:03:46] knowing, Lord, this is a perfect word.
[2:03:51] Lord which will perfect each of us.
[2:03:55] I pray Lord if there is anybody here
[2:03:57] among us
[2:04:00] you have not filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:04:01] yet
[2:04:03] oh Lord may you fill them with the Holy
[2:04:06] Spirit.
[2:04:08] Let them hunger for it. Let them thirst
[2:04:10] for it Lord because without it Lord they
[2:04:15] can never receive this revelation.
[2:04:18] I pray, oh Lord, that you'll bring each
[2:04:20] of us to a closer walk with you
[2:04:25] that we may know you more.
[2:04:28] We may know you more. Bless all those
[2:04:30] that have been following us by the way
[2:04:32] of the internet.
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:36] Bless each one of them. Father, Lord,
[2:04:38] even bless the givers that have given.
[2:04:40] Lord,
[2:04:42] may you take what they've given and
[2:04:43] multiply it towards your work.
[2:04:46] We give you thanks Lord in Jesus name.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we dismiss
[2:04:56] just wanted to let you know uh that um
[2:04:58] we are remaining with brother can you
[2:05:00] help me brother somebody in the treasury
[2:05:02] department. How much money are we
[2:05:04] remaining with for uh the clearance of
[2:05:08] um the
[2:05:12] uh we we are supposed to pay 100 million
[2:05:15] shillings.
[2:05:18] Uh by by the end of this month
[2:05:24] we're supposed to pay 100 million.
[2:05:27] We already paid 10 as a a fee to kind of
[2:05:29] put the land off the market.
[2:05:34] So we need to pay 90 million more
[2:05:38] and then the remaining 120
[2:05:41] expected to pay it in small installments
[2:05:47] within 8 months.
[2:05:50] So we've been collecting money for over
[2:05:52] four years.
[2:05:56] We thought we'll collect forever and
[2:05:57] land will continue appreciating and we
[2:05:59] will never be able to buy it.
[2:06:03] So if we have faith, we thought we
[2:06:05] should make such a bold move.
[2:06:09] [Music]
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you would call a bold
[2:06:14] move in Luganda.
[2:06:17] [Music]
[2:06:25] Yeah. Because it looks like, oh, what if
[2:06:27] we not able to? We have to parent.
[2:06:30] We we just be doing these things by
[2:06:33] faith friends.
[2:06:36] 100% by faith
[2:06:38] faith. Faith has works.
[2:06:42] We are remaining with how much to make
[2:06:44] 100 million
[2:06:46] 3.14 million shillings. That's what we
[2:06:49] are remaining with. And um so after we
[2:06:53] have that then we can go ahead to make
[2:06:55] the transaction.
[2:07:01] and then we talk the rest of the things
[2:07:02] afterwards.
[2:07:04] Amen. So I just wanted to let you know
[2:07:06] that remind you
[2:07:08] let us sing. I pledge allegiance before
[2:07:10] we dismiss.
[2:07:13] Amen.
[2:07:15] I have heard
[2:07:18] how creations
[2:07:20] long
[2:07:22] ago
[2:07:24] were brought before
[2:07:29] a tyrant's throne.
[2:07:33] They were told
[2:07:35] that he would spend
[2:07:40] their lives
[2:07:42] if they would renounce
[2:07:46] the name
[2:07:48] of Christ will. But one by one
[2:07:54] they chose
[2:07:56] to die.
[2:08:00] the son of God.
[2:08:03] They would not deny
[2:08:07] like a great
[2:08:09] and joy
[2:08:12] quiet.
[2:08:15] I can almost hear
[2:08:19] their voicees
[2:08:21] ring. Will I bless

[2:09:03] the years have gone.
[2:09:06] At the cross of Jesus
[2:09:11] still goes on.
[2:09:14] Now a time has come
[2:09:18] to count the cost
[2:09:22] to reject the world
[2:09:26] and embrace the crosses.
[2:09:30] Oh, one by one,
[2:09:33] let us leave a life
[2:09:37] for the one who died
[2:09:41] to give us life
[2:09:45] till the trumpet sound
