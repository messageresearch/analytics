wonderful amen why don't you have your seats for just a moment amen Amina I would like to take this opportunity to greet every one of you Lord Jesus Christ amen are you happy to be here amen for me we are blessed because we are here in these youth meetings I'm really expectant [Music] I believe that the Lord is going to do marvelous things in our lives [Music] I'm really are you expecting amen our team from Kenya just arrived this morning we will get to hear more from them in the coming uh in the coming services I just wanted to take one minute just to read a little quarter of a quote just to um announced to you the burden I have for this for these meetings and what I believe that the Lord is going to accomplish [Music] in the message how can I overcome [Music] our Prophet says we find here that God has always had Overcomers he has had Overcomers in every age we don't need to wait for the preacher to shout amen we might as well there's always always every time that there is being on the earth God has always had somebody could put his hands on witness in the earth he's never been without a witness but sometimes just once but somebody the overcome like the Saints of all there's a lot of going on in our in our time in our generation there is a law that the devil is achieving what was a lot of young people the devil is is killing is taught spiritually and physically a lot of them that are in bars at this time a lot of them that are lost in the denominational World [Music] a lot of them that do not know what you know a lot of them that have not experienced what you have experienced [Music] but in the same time in every generation God will have a witness whether all the others will not overcome God will have a witness someone that will overcome someone that will overcome you know I do not know but I know my face [Music] someone will be bad into the group of the Overcomers I believe that with all my heart through this weekend [Music] and let us be prayerful as we're beginning these meetings really prayerful this is this is not a calling to young people to come and begin coupling and begin you know it's just not to just know one another [Music] baby it's not a is not a meetings of exchanging numbers when I say meetings it's not meetings of you one another to begin exchanging numbers and just you know you know you know being all over the place [Music] I believe it is my burden that I have in my house is that these are meetings of young people with the Holy Spirit so if that's not the purpose you came with I hope you don't get disappointed we will meet the Lord you will meet the Lord if you don't have the Holy Spirit we will receive the Holy Spirit it's an assurance because that's what that's what the word has told us so in these meetings by we are going to be spoken to by people by people by Brothers they brought the ministers these are people that have been changed I've had an experience in this message and all of them are younger ministers like you but where is so this is true send out a message to us [Music] that God is still moving and without wasting a lot of time I will be speaking more as the days go by we will be here this is our first service going to minister to us again brother Mike was being impacted by this message all his life away born I think he will give his own testimony but he has a wonderful question ever since we got to know one another we've become good friends our friendship really is around the message he has a minister to us here once yeah when days of the voice was still in a very little place this is still little but we were in a little a more little place and we were blessed by his ministers and I believe today we all will be blessed by his friends Michael Ray is a minister in um we just sat on our feet together I was thinking whether I should say this or not okay brother Branham was a prophet of God how many believe that yeah not many people in his time realized that he had a Ministry other than just a minister all right foreign is one of those that received the Revelation some of you who have listened to his testimony says it was on a log istics and I will not go into the details but that's when he went but speaking to him that's when the master met him he realized that this ministry was more than just a minister he was a prophet is preached this message and taken it to many countries and his generation and many in his generation did wonderful works is the grandson of brother Eddie biscuit and I believe he is representing Our Generation the others overcame they stood for the world they did not tolerate any nonsense I believe there is another generation and he's going to preach this message I love him I love him I love you [Music] why don't you just lift your hands [Music] myself amazing [Music] because foreign [Music] amen with that on her lips let's just go to him in prayer Heavenly Father Guru surely that's the most precious things you can hear from the lips of your children that we love you Lord how it must so thrill your heart to hear us express Lord our adoration our longing for Our Savior and Lord made this next few days of times [Music] [Music] [Music] we must deliver those that need delivery if you lose the bonds Lord that would slave the captive you Lord those that are sick and needy Lord for if you cannot do it no one can touch we serve the mighty conqueror this weekend we pray Lord we dedicate these next hours and days [Music] Lord we really put aside in this moment this meeting is our soul focused tonight you would move in an impactful Supernatural so Lord we dedicate these meetings lay them at your feet foreign [Music] God bless you good to see each one of you it's just a real honor to be here in Uganda again I love to be with the bride around the world now you you might you might not be able to to travel but when you go to different locations and you interact with the bride of Christ you find out we're all the same we're just one big family time no distance amen so are you expecting this weekend [Applause] as the saying goes you get what you expect I was thinking brother bus was talking about just even one would be impacted this weekend and I thought of brother Brown spoke about DL Moody there's a little lady a little washer woman lady who got a little building yeah and she got it already she scrubbed the floors so that a preacher could come in and preach special services and one little boy came to service and God got a hold of his heart and that little boy is and in his time he turned his world upside down the Gospel of Jesus Christ maybe in this meeting there's maybe a little Dio Moody my little sister that'll get a hold of God that'll turn your community your area your city your country and it'll never be the same again amen so let God have his way amen so let's go to the word Galatians five no verse 1. now there might be some we're just gonna go I'm I'm a different preacher I should say so you just go with me tonight we'll try and get down to where we live right down into the trenches we're gonna have a good time I mean amen amen I'm gonna speak tonight and we'll title it an unrestrained generation unrestrained so I'm not holding you back I'm restraining you right now but unrest okay [Music] Galatians 5 verse 1 stands Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ have made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage foreign [Music] foreign foreign to them foreign scripture in verse 7. 0 is going well she speaks and references disease foreign a runner race [Music] that's the only event at the very beginning of the games and so at the very end if whoever there was no there was no time because there's no stopwatch no one was there back in uh you know 80 30 or you know whatever it was perfect there was no milliseconds at least that they could count amen so all that mattered across the Finish Line first [Music] that's how you want just get across [Applause] okay and nobody if someone was taking running seriously every hindrance was taken seriously every Runner but he looked and see made sure he didn't have any extra fat on him it was very important to be very slim and true you didn't want an extra weight hindering your ability to run you were setting aside distractions you were saying clothing in fact clothing wasn't even worn in those race it is what it was training was important young you just didn't think yeah you know what I think I'm gonna go to race today you're 50 pounds overweight you haven't trained a day in your life [Music] you've got a huge token on you you wouldn't have shown up to the race he would have been extremely hindered they even said sir you're ejected there's no way you'll even finish this race you got way too many hindrances the hindrance is the state of being interfered with and he seems foreign yeah try and run with those let alone [Applause] [Music] you can't barely walk let alone run nothing and if the official said hey you need to run with these off run the race do you have that the video ready at all those those few files your name okay that's okay you know many times we start out in life we have great intentions we have the best the best thought of what we're gonna achieve but too often something comes up and it hinders us from moving forward and have a little video and it's a bike race there's like a bicycle race and there's there's like hundreds of bites and so there's one there's a whole bunch of them they're riding really hard trying to run one free to win the race [Music] and there's a spectator on the side a spectator [Music] and all the bicycles are saying they're going this way they're they're running there yeah they're peddling that way and it derailed him he fell over here he came out of the middle of nowhere and so something came up and it stopped him from achieving what he was expecting yeah [Applause] anybody had ever had one of those types yeah you have made me have some great plans I'm gonna go interview to University [Music] I have some I have some goals but something comes up and it stops it yeah anybody ever tried to do some kind of Maintenance project or whatever you know you go out there you need to fix something you [Applause] just don't you're not able to finish you know you're going to come out of this this weekend here not yeah and you're gonna come out refreshed we said that was an incredible set of meetings I'm not gonna lie the battle is gonna get hotter after this weekend bear pack s so you need to be aware of hindrances you go back to school you go back to work you get around your circle of friends you get around your co-workers and Satan's gonna start throwing in Temptations they are like the sign board as you're running the race [Applause] [Music] his amazing job this is a fantastic job making better money but you can't even get to a service that's a hindrance he'll throw in hindrances into the spiritual Realms imagination [Applause] he wages a Full Assault yes right here right in the mind because if you can plant a seed in your mind a little hindrance and it starts to grow starts to affect your home and that hindrance starts to impact it starts to affect come to a global position your spiritual growth and it creates a deformity I have a picture it was a carrotects a guy that someone pull out of a garden um and so the carrot and actually there's a ring in the dirt and the little seed just was dropped just so perfectly anyway and the ring then constricted [Applause] [Music] because something constrained its growth that's what happens when something comes into mind it can create a complex a certain mental deformity no for that or whatever means rude and it hinders our growth brother Brown he says he says that you know of a night when I stand in front of men like this smart man to the ministry he says in me stand here knowing grammar school he says I have a complex truly entertainment brother Brown was stating here there were some real smart men yeah and he said I only know grammar school he said these men are far beyond my abilities he said I have a complex he says it's so easy to build a complexity he said another day he said I had an interview with brother away little gonna win he says a good man I don't want you but he built himself around a complex a kind of another complex he said it's just something a little in your mind you keep thinking a certain way he says go back and check it with the scriptures then go from there another place he says he says no wonder he says I'm an erotic because he's brother Brian would say he'd get nervous he says I have done this one thing instead of getting a complexion I tried to hold steady keeping my but if you leave it unchecked if you leave a complex unchecked it broke about a brand he talks about a Vine that will wrap around a stick yes because something hindered it he says but if you can remove that him that thing will grow straight amen and that's by God's grace tonight we need to buy God's grace remove the hindrances we needed pull them out because we need you you need to grow straight we need to grow strong in the world [Music] we don't need nothing of the world laying inside of our Lives amen hey man so we're going to talk about strongholds because the hindrance is a stronghold of the Mind it takes a grip and holds you hostage scripture says for though we walk in the flesh do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen that's the power that you have through this is to tear down the Captivity or should say cast down the imagination pull down the stronghold [Music] so now the strongholds it is a fortified place [Music] it's built to put it it places a presence and a defensible position when someone with a King when he would build a stronghold [Music] it's there to to just make a statement it's so that his kingdom would look fortified and so a king would put a stronghold here in his territory and pretty now that he put another one there nobody I need to start to guard his borders with a stronghold it wasn't his main Castle but it would be a strong defense position [Music] a man in a stronghold get stronger the more you put into it the more you build it out you know if he just built you know a puny little you know uh little bricks you know just super small and maybe yay high and I'm with my bow and arrow and I got a thousand man army coming against me and I have a little brick wall here and I've got my bow and arrow what kind of stronghold is that nothing but if I made a massive Stone Fortress that was that was 30 40 feet tall it was 100 feet wide and I filled it with all the the weapons and I made it so strong I have food in there I have resources in there and I put 50 men in there now I've got a strong man the more I put into it how stronger it is all right wow now the reverse works as well I should say the the negative also applies [Music] Satan wants to put a stronghold in your mind [Music] he wants to build a defensible position against God and the more you know the more thought you put toward it the more you strengthen his position maybe a certain situation takes place maybe you're in a certain relationship and something hard it creates a hurt it creates an emotional bruise you start to think about that [Music] you start to build a position amen Amina maybe maybe it's something you were raised somehow you were raised [Music] maybe there was a death in the family something happens and it start you if you start to dwell on it [Music] certain emotions start to take a hole Amber and you dwell on that constantly constantly dwelling on that the stronghold is being strengthened there's better Brandon says you look to Calvary you give it to Christ job said the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord he didn't dwell on that yeah but job wasn't allowing a stronghold to take place he had his he had his comforters come in he started to throw his thoughts at him he took courage he encouraged himself in the Lord I know my redeemer lives he didn't let that sorrow all his camels his donkeys he was stripped down to nothing but he said I set my face to Christ bless him be the name of the Lord [Applause] amen Amina and so now a person a person that allows a stronghold in the mind if they'll if they allow what happens is they start to become hindered and everything you now go through it's played through the lens [Music] of that stronghold so something happens maybe there's a certain relationship that breaks apart and you start and you letting anger starts to you you get angry about it and you just start to dwell on that and everything now is is is seen through that foreign you can have somebody that is maybe abused oh yeah yeah and they start feeling worthless in their whole life starts to be played through or lives through that stronghold and they dwell on that and it starts to create a fortification you need to take it to Calvary you start to say well nobody likes me they don't really know anything about me nobody even cares for me no one really wants me anyway and these thoughts start to rain in your mind [Music] which are lies but it fortifies the devil's position in your mind and then when you start to hear a message preach and you're listening to maybe a a preacher preach and because that strongholds God so strong the preacher's speaking about how God loves you and it just starts bouncing off the wall the wall the stronghold of rejection stronghold of worthlessness yeah yeah well you just don't understand you don't understand my situation foreign [Music] [Music] it's putting a barrier up and you become captive and scripture says you did run well who Satan did hinder you that you should not obey the truth [Music] amen that's his tactic is to build such a stronghold [Music] that you didn't believe the lie [Music] that it could never come down but I'm here tonight to tell you on the authority of God's word scripture says the truth shall set you free I'm a Zimmer there is no stronghold there is no life there is no situation that God cannot overcome amen amen there's Deliverance tonight you don't have to wait one more evening I don't know your situation I don't know what you've gone through but if there's a stronghold in your life God is here tonight if you would just rise up Let the wind of the Holy Spirit blow through the smoke [Applause] he said I'm here to deliver you God's Army where's the sandwich it's marching on the Satan's stronghold right now amen Satan thinks he's built something strong in your mind you've dwelled too long you thought your problem is too great but God is marching right now I'm here tonight Satan is looking out with his binoculars he's saying I don't know it looks like we got trouble coming over there is trouble coming over Satan's defeated you just need to believe it God [Applause] Brown says a complex of self-pity pressed in my kitchen he says that you're in a pitiful condition then you get pity in yourself you want everybody to pity that's what pity does woe is me he says the pro the problem is it brings attention now to you to you the spirit of tormenting gets the attention it wants to Glory at once you say oh my problem is so terrible listen this happened to me Joe would have said oh my goodness oh everything I owned is gone my children have died and he started to dwell on his problem that's what the demon of pity would desire you just don't know how hard it is this day and age how do you think I can overcome when laodicea is so strong I've got my phone and I got my Tick Tock and my WhatsApp [Music] oh it's just so hard oh not Demon's like yeah it is hard you'll never overcome it and you start building him up and he's like he's like oh yeah I am not strong you keep telling yourself I'm that strong damn it Jordan you are a man [Applause] brother Branham says I got hit one time he says he was eight days at a meeting he goes I stayed on the platform praying for the sick he says I got to a place I got to a place I just can't feel any better but he goes I heard a scream I'm an eagle screen he says that Christians they confess not what they see but what they believe amen it don't make a difference what you're looking at with your eyes but your eyes are Faith look at a promise that says I can do all things through Christ become who strengthens me [Applause] it's my God's fight or the mighty conquerors fight [Applause] amen amen amen God has given us the weapons to defeat it hey man brother Branham says the whole Kingdom of Satan's sickness death and Sorrows but God is alive he says they're battling they're battling right now in this building that's a better Brandon said it's current today those forces are battling right now right now in your mind Satan's telling you right now I don't know preacher I don't know if you're just preaching a bunch of a bunch of Bluffs a number the devil's telling you that a preacher's speaking a bunch of Lies it's warring and you're at a battle do I believe the truth do I believe this do you believe this or do I believe the lie that he's telling you right now you're in a battle you're a war or anybody he says they battled day by day with you every Force every Force Satan following you along that great big Priestly kingly foreign okay great big Priestly kingly we got all those words trying to scare the liver out of you that's what brother Brandon said he's trying to scare the liver out of you [Music] but he said God you're fortified with the gospel with the word of Truth around your loins he says preacher that's what it is it's the helmet of salvation it's a shield of Faith the sword of the words he says you meet him this is how you come to the devil Daddy sit down you say that but I need you in the name of the Lord God of Israel foreign you know what David did David did not look at Goliath oh my goodness that's just too scary and run away no David didn't do that David looked at glass and he welcomed the fight tonight amen amen David says I'm coming after you glass I come to you in the name of the Lord God of the army of Israel who you defy Satan is defying you tonight he's saying you're not worthy you're worthless he said you're not good enough to overcome but God said I've ordained you I've chosen you to be my generation to overcome step up to battle young people step up with the word of God is here I come against you with the word of God in my list amen amen glory to God Satan's Army brings diseases but God's Army is commissioned you have been commissioned hey man that means God put Authority on you when you're a commissioned officer in the Army you've been given certain authorities so you can walk into a certain situation oh that's an officer he's been given certain authorities commissioned to do a certain work amen you've been commissioned to do a certain work however you've been given Authority not your daddy's not your mamas not your pastors you also our commissioned would you defeat the enemy [Applause] foreign [Applause] 's gonna throw it at you but God's Army is to cast him out you say well brother Michael how do I do that yeah let's talk about it construction amen foreign we're gonna lay Siege yeah you know what a Siege is ah it's just it's saying a Siege you when you surround something a Siege is Israel when it came to Jericho they started to March around the walls who knows in the days of Jerusalem after Jesus was ascended when Titus came in do you know that Titus came in and he surrounded Jerusalem he laid Siege to Jerusalem nothing could get in nothing could get out foreign because a fortification a stronghold it should go a hindrance of your mind is only able to succeed it's only able to uh to be strong if you can get resources in Singapore oh I didn't get it get it that's okay we're gonna get it hey man if you build if there's a stronghold or a fortress it needs food it needs water it needs weapons it needs people and those people need to eat need to drink we need to be able to fight but a Siege [Music] stops the inflow so a caravan can't come along and give resources to the strongholds amen you follow okay so if you put a Siege around it nothing can come in it's blocked okay man so when Titus went around Jerusalem nothing could come in so they it's a terrible situation [Music] but that's how you defeat a strong City the first time that that tactic you hear in the scripture is Jericho the angel of the Lord told Joshua how to defeat a strong fortified he says oh my goodness that Jericho is huge yes the walls are you know many many feet thick it's impossible to get in there my problem in my mind was a hurt in my life difficult situation I'm going through better energy it's too massive it's the biggest stronghold ever it's like Jericho but I'm here to tell you there's a Joshua that gave the way what were you what you need to do to defeat Jericho amen we're gonna surround we're gonna surround your enemy tonight amen amen you ready you're ready you have to want to or you're not young you have to want to deliver be delivered don't you be holding that back you gotta let the door a pride but I don't want people to know my problems I don't want it to be exposed expose it tonight tell the devil what you here and I'm gonna allow the army of God to surround you now because tonight is the night of Deliverance amen yes sir you say it sounds complicated it sounds complicated that's the devil talking to you [Music] Joshua Yeshua he started to go yeah he said hurry Joshua go around the city and March around just keep marching around hey man man he said that sounds really simple exactly it's that simple he marched around the city for seven days then they blow their trumpets they were surrounding the city with obedience to God's word amen with faith and with praise amen and the power of Faith well they walked around that City they might not have been quite ready on day one but they started walking around the world they started pondering he's the god that opened the Red Sea he's the god that brought plagues he's a God that brought us out of Egypt he's the god that drunk Quail on us he gave us Mana when we needed it yeah opened the Rock and gave us water they started to ponder their face started to grow as they started to March a while in the walls of his head you might need to walk around your wall a little bit and start rehearsing but your God is done you start speaking about oh my god he has saved me he's delivered my mama there he delivered my daddy there he healed me when I was sick there he broke this Darkness here you start pointing to situations in your mind as your face starts to build as and you start wondering wow he is a mighty God he is able to conquer my battle he is able to break down my stronghold and on day number seven they were able to go around the wall and their faith reached a point where then their mouth opened up with praise open your mouth with praise you start to say yes he is the god of Glory he is The Great I Am he's the alpha the Omega the beginning and the end his name the Prince of Peace is here amen and when that shout of praise foreign [Applause] [Applause] thank you do not underestimate of the power of your praise the impacted your voice when you just start to praise His name that's why the devil wants to hold that back he says uh don't go to church you don't need to go there you don't need to sing praises you know why he's saying that too because it's his and his army his kingdom well that crumbles at your praise [Applause] amen [Music] [Applause] he's just a bluff foreign you say well I've got a stronghold of depression how do I cut off that stronghold all right I'm only what we're just gonna take this tonight Romans 15 13 says if you're feeling depressed we're gonna now surround your stronghold [Music] through the power of the Holy Ghost I will say unto God my rock why have you forgotten me why do I mourning because of the oppression of my enemies as with a sword in my bones my enemies taunt me they reproach me while they say continually to me where is your god why are you hey this is Psalms he says why are you cast down o my inner self why should you moan over me and be disquieted hope in foreign which according to His abundant Mercy have begotten us again to a lively home by the resurrection of Jesus Christ to an inheritance reserved in heaven for you number one that's the hope it is an expectation of the of Resurrection an expectation of an Incorruptible mortality is not away my life is so terrible no you have glory to look forward to see when your eternity to look forward to that's the Hopeless depression get to such a low Place everything gets inward facing nothing's good you know brother Brandon speaks about [Music] you know the offset for that you know how to strangle that one um surround it with some purpose live for others [Applause] amen oh I'm just so low and depressed I'm pretty life is just no good for me when's the last time you did something for somebody else when's the last time you turned that you know she says I'm living for my family my family I'm gonna see if I can make this day The Best Day Ever for my brother or sister he said that is just way too simple that's not deep brother Michael oh God true Christianity foreign [Music] you just find how fast that demon flees when you start turning your life that direction man brother Branham said he was at a table and there was a man there it was a I can't remember where he came from but he was just kind of a uh foreign she was kind of a little afraid of him this fella he's kind of scared his wife and brother Brandon says well how do you do it and they had given him some dinner and he said uh brother Brown says where are you from I said I'll just here and there I said well where are you going oh he said oh the same just here and there [Music] I said letter Brandon said what purpose do you have in life he said no purpose of course you'll be depressed of course you'll feel unfulfilled this Dragon through life with no purpose brother Brown says we gotta have something that we got a purpose foreign he says don't let that be you just a floater and a Drifter but he says you can never amount to anything like that let's go up and do something about it let's put our shoulder to the wheels let's see what the sick gets here see that God is laid down among the people signs and wonders he says I'm satisfied there will be things happening here that it'll Shake It for the kingdom of God you want to shake Uganda young people you want to shake Uganda Uganda for the kingdom of God rise up show them get behind your bodies that you go to but oh God use me on some small capacity foreign [Music] amen [Music] stronghold of rejection nobody likes me everybody hates me I'm rejected I won't ask you if anybody's thought that before but you lift that up before the Lord It's Your Journal words that you want to keep myself let me read a couple scriptures for you you're gonna tuck these in your little script belt and yeah you're gonna put in that little bag that David reached into when Goliath came I'm gonna give you a few Stones right now when Goliath of rejection and you look up like this oh my goodness you're going to be all right I'm gonna pull out my Stones I'm ready I'm ready for you amen here you go Sam rejected I don't you're not saying that I'm the devil's telling me that that one stone says ye have not chosen me foreign [Applause] yes sir that ye should go forth oh and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask and that shall not your father together he may give it to you that should be enough because it actually didn't take any more than one stone to take Goliath down that's what it took chat when the Devil comes at you and starts spewing sit anywhere Sorry Devil [Applause] foreign in fact he ordained you for this time so he's given you what you need for this time so that your fruit will remain s Jeremiah says before I form thee yes that's all that matters he knew me yet he loved me aim handy he whose Glory makes the heavens shine and just see Marvel cartoon [Applause] there is many more scriptures because what if your problem isn't is rejection what if it's anger soon you might have gone through something that's created just a whole lot of resentment built up a stronghold I'm gonna tell you what it's surrounded with it you need to start marching around that wall yeah with forgiveness forgiveness [Music] that is what you march around that wall of anger with hey I've already know it was soon when you stand praying forgive if he ought have an ought against anybody that's your father that's your father also which is in heaven foreign [Music] that's just too simple and just watch it crumble yeah you just brother Brown says if you were in prayer if you're in prayer how can you be angry because in that atmosphere you can't be angry you feel anger coming you just get in more you need prayer you get in your prayer closet is too simple brother Michael well it wasn't a crazy amount of weapons that defeated Goliath but yes David didn't walk up there with some big catapult no he did not just hold it right there I got a crank this thing up no he saw what he said it was a simple stone amen a simple stone came in a rock that's cute without human hair that came out of a mountain that crushed to just the statue that stood before [Music] my I could go through a stronghold of fear why why is I could go through strongholds of failure it's all in here God is our refuge in strength very present help in time and trouble where we are being a Twitter guy therefore will not we fear katonga where we are being attacked Isaiah 41 and 10. fear down I am with thee now with being on display for I am thy God Amen I will strengthen thee yay I will help them yay I will uphold them in my right hand righteousness

he said come on it's just 75 pounds it was a piece of cake the little weights that down the road you don't know but it's the sin that so easily beset us everything I don't care how small it is because it's not an easy Road it's a rugged Road and that's why God says lay it all aside by the time you got a mountain ahead you don't want nothing I don't want to go through that door you don't want to be the runner with a pound of cement behind you here not drag yourself I'm barely gonna cross run the race [Applause] whatever tonight drop the weight brother Michael I don't want that weight no more I'm

but this Olympics in Barcelona Barcelona he was doing really good he had ran a couple races and he was performing really well and so he was in the semi-final I think it was the maybe the 400 meter something like that and he was running he was going at a good pace and you see in the video he's running got a good stride and he said that something popped and he felt a pop now and his hamstring had torn um and you see him stop cause you again she goes to the ground and everybody starts passing and he's down he's in pain foreign a vital part of his leg barely even move he's just kind of cringing maybe tonight maybe you're mine and the words Satan is and he stood there on the ground but his mind went back when he couldn't run the prior race he said in his mind I have to finish this up and in your mind tonight some vital part of your spiritual walk has received a snap somehow wow but your mind is thinking about the scriptures that we just talked about tonight and something happens he gets up now you will come and he starts it starts to go now I ain't stopping now guys and what happens is out of the crowd [Music] comes his heavenly father I mean his father this is true his father come out runs down and he puts his arm around his son he gives away to his son he starts and the officials they come you can't be here they try to shoot his father away he's got to go at this all alone and his father and he takes his son in his arms and the officials come out to get a stretches I'm not out of this race I'm not down enough I'm finishing this course [Applause] if a natural father

sang the devil should be on the run now it should be on the run I believe that by the time that these meetings end is [Applause] amen Amina that's what we can do surround him [Music] I was just I was just I had a brother say that in the court one of the courts that he was telling us that the devil is a great big Priestly kind of fellow um can someone help him to interpret that a great big Priestly fellow of this but brother says listen he says watch him the Bible says there is no Beauty we should desire him little old skinny guy Jesus was he wasn't a great big Priestly looking fellow kingly Priestly I overweight but Jesus is a little skinny fellow yes I am the resurrection hallelujah amen he says he that Believers in me now this is my my favorite part yet and he said Believers doubt this is [Music] this is the reason why we are here it doesn't matter what you're battling since it doesn't matter how bad you feel you are it doesn't matter you are here or you want to live again even if you are dead yeah you know I know that in this meeting some people who don't even believe in Jesus Christ will come the young man so don't be afraid if you see someone who is dressed in a funny ways let them sit under the power of the world the world corrects the error I believe and you've been seated in church it doesn't matter your situation I want to say these Dry Bones will live again my prayer is that by the time we leave we'll go out to cause a Revival together because we will be the Revival [Applause] how many charged up tonight I'd like to go on and on I want to say God bless you brother Michael for yielding yourself and accepting to be used of the Holy Spirit amen Amina at this time I'd just like to give a few announcements and then we will break off for tonight amen Amina so this is a three-day meetings so this is our first meeting of course and then we are going to have a full day tomorrow and then we have another full day on Sunday Nissan like I said this is just the beginning but it's just the beginning so we have a lot of fisting to do let us step radar amen I mean I know that most of us or most of you will be staying now I want to say that when we when when I failed to call these youth meetings I did not plan it to be um I did not plan it to be a camp morning I did not plan for it to be resident meetings so I did not expect that that will happen it wasn't my plan at all of the Lord and you notice some of you who received the invitation the first flyer that went out we didn't even have any camp fee on it will just come and feast on the world and then go back to our house and I thought that only the groups young people from around Kampala will just come and join us but uh how many how many here at this time are not from out of Kampala just raise up your hands how many here when they come on have come from outside Kampala about food they will work just raise up your hand up high yeah this is the fastest so you can see the number okay and so I noticed uh when the flyer went out we started receiving calls of young people who wanted to come and I mean they won't be a part of the meetings so I thought what are we going to do some short notice we've not prepared to do this expensive to do this and we were not prepared at all I told them I think we should do this we don't have the resources and then the restroom shall leave to the Lord and so I could not begin to call Brother Isaac who is going to come and Minister and say brother Isaac sent me money I prepare youth meetings I could not ask brother brother brother Michael to send me money to prepare youth because that God if God wanted this God must provide and I know God will provide to make this a success because this is not my work okay and so we prepared we we incidentally have a school close by here and uh spoke to the owner of the school and they were willing to give us they were willing to give us hostels for the for the for you to to camp at and all this was on short notice but uh they at a fee they were able to give us those hostels and so we thank God that we were able to secure that and so we decided to set a fee you take our own and that really is not going to take care of you a hundred percent and uh I know that also many of you have told us that you're not able to pay that fee but we said still if you would like to come just come and how the Lord and um we have a a full schedule tomorrow in chair tuner program uh Institute of Asia we will be having and if you want to have to write on a piece of paper that's okay this is out on the fly on the website you can actually check it out so that you can get the whole program those of you who are not going to be in the hostels so in the morning very early here we're going to be here at 6 30. so even those of you who are non-residents and you'd like to be here at that time for the morning devotion you are welcome it will be one hour there will be some little preaching for about 30 or 40 minutes and we have a very wonderful young man who is going to minister to us tomorrow in the morning devotion again amen God linked me up with this young man some many years ago in Nairobi music and at that time he was not a preach of course but the desire to serve the Lord and you come tomorrow and see what the Lord and that's what that's what he will do in us as well I believe so our brother Ken has a wonderful testimony and I wouldn't want you to miss it for anything so then after that we shall have the main service beginning at around nine hours and then we will have a second service services at around this time that is for tomorrow and on Sunday amen Amina so this is the north those who have not registered especially ministers must register before going away I believe that is to help us on planning for the meals not registered and and you're going to be around especially during lunch tomorrow we need to know we need to know how many people we have so that we can be able to yeah praise the name of the Lord now uh brother can you can you come and update us about the brothers were the hostels this brother is the chairman of the of our organizing committee yes ah come on he told me he can't speak and I forced him to speak brother Michael see what you've done okay now here's the arrangement we have the wardens and deacons that are going to help us registered as residents you are going to be taken to where you will Lodge straight from here and then after that I think right there they will also let you know supper should be actually should be served around this time from here it will be supper but at first I think you will go and be sure where you're going to Lodge uh amen I think yeah I think the rest of the announcements will be given there uh so we shall we shall have lunch tomorrow and on Sunday so if you want to uh give towards the support I believe this is how we were taught to do it must be freeware if you want to give the Lord will bless you for doing it otherwise let me invite our brother to give us a song and dismiss us Our Kind Heavenly Father we want to thank you so much Lord for such a wonderful day today that you have given to us you have visited us in a special way and our hearts abandoned within us and fathers we break off for tonight some have traveled a long ways and they want to go and rest Lord may you give us a good night of rest and may we return here tomorrow early morning I believe you have more for each of us and we just ask that you come and take control take over these meetings in Jesus name be amen God bless you love him I'd Rather Have Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] okay okay then to be [Music] okay thank you [Music] man you can be seated [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] I can't oh man [Music]
