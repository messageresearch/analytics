[0:39] Corinthians chapter five a recording
[0:44] [Music]
[0:45] is
[0:51] second Corinthians chapter five we read
[0:54] one verse verse 21
[0:57] [Music]
[0:58] um
[1:14] second Corinthians chapter
[1:16] 5 verse 21. it raised this one for he
[1:20] has made him to be seen for us who knew
[1:23] not sin that we might be made the
[1:25] righteousness of God in him
[1:27] again yeah
[1:37] [Music]
[1:38] let us pray
[1:40] Lord Jesus we ask you this evening to
[1:43] come back to us once again
[1:50] reveal yourself to us
[1:52] Lord by the end of this meeting
[1:57] May our hearts Rejoice within us
[2:01] because we know that he would have
[2:03] spoken to us
[2:07] in Jesus name
[2:13] so Jesus Paid It All yes
[2:17] amen Amina that's what we will speak on
[2:22] tonight once again and
[2:27] I didn't get to to finish it on Sunday
[2:30] uh the Sunday
[2:32] but I trust that we'll be able to get
[2:35] somewhere tonight
[2:38] I'm happy to see every one of you I want
[2:40] to say God bless you the message
[2:44] are you ready for the word tonight
[2:49] me
[2:51] so
[2:52] um the the
[2:54] we read a lot of scriptures on Sunday
[2:56] because Sunday transformation
[2:59] and I did not plan on Sunday to deal
[3:01] with the serpent seed although I had to
[3:03] touch it a little bit
[3:07] because
[3:09] you see there is no way you can be able
[3:12] to talk about Sin without talking about
[3:14] the origin the original scene
[3:21] and you know there is only one scene
[3:26] only one sin
[3:29] and that is what is going to take people
[3:30] to Hell
[3:33] there's not as many sins it's only one
[3:35] scene
[3:36] [Music]
[3:38] that is unbelief of the truth
[3:41] the others are just the fruit of that
[3:44] sin
[3:45] [Music]
[3:47] so when the Bible says that man's sin
[3:50] that he says that for that
[3:53] for all have sinned I believe
[3:56] you see the sin that was done
[4:01] was what actually happened in the very
[4:05] beginning
[4:05] [Music]
[4:08] that's why the Bible says that all of us
[4:10] you each of us are born in sins
[4:18] [Music]
[4:20] when when Eve when when God gave adam
[4:23] the word
[4:25] Adam was Duty bound to keep that word
[4:31] you not only believe every word but to
[4:35] keep it since
[4:38] not only to believe it
[4:41] is that your car but also to keep
[4:43] everyone
[4:44] and you see when someone unbelieves the
[4:48] word
[4:50] then you don't need to ask them you only
[4:52] need to look at their life
[4:55] it is your life that shows whether
[4:58] you're a Believer or not
[5:02] you see when God gave adam the word and
[5:04] he told him you see every fruit every
[5:06] tree every tree you will eat of it but
[5:09] of this one you shall not eat of it
[5:16] and then Adam
[5:20] and then when God left
[5:23] of course later on we know that he takes
[5:25] the woman out of the man
[5:28] and then now they become man and a woman
[5:33] and so they are together man and woman
[5:36] in the garden
[5:39] we don't see God telling Eve the word
[5:42] again
[5:46] God spoke the word once again
[5:49] to Adam and then Adam was the one that
[5:54] now took it upon himself
[5:57] to teach his wife what God had said
[6:02] that's why the prophet says that a man
[6:04] is a priest in in his house
[6:09] are you hearing me this evening that
[6:12] even God will require
[6:15] your wife on your hands
[6:19] if you're married and your wife does
[6:21] something
[6:23] God will ask you you will be responsible
[6:27] before God
[6:29] but not the other way around
[6:32] what your husband does
[6:35] brother you are not going to be
[6:36] responsible
[6:38] sister I'm not going to be responsible
[6:39] before God
[6:40] um
[6:42] but what your husband does what your
[6:45] wife does rather
[6:48] the man is responsible people and is
[6:50] answerable before God um
[6:55] because the woman is a reflection of the
[6:57] man
[7:00] the woman is a part of the man
[7:03] the woman is supposed to reflect the
[7:06] nature and character of her husband
[7:12] and so when she was taken out of the man
[7:16] came into the world and she heard the
[7:20] word of God from her husband
[7:24] that's why when a sister accepts to be
[7:27] married to a man who does not believe
[7:30] the word
[7:34] she has made the greatest mistake
[7:39] because this is what is going to guide
[7:41] your life
[7:43] this is the one that's going to lead
[7:45] your life
[7:46] your entire life is based on that
[8:14] from that time
[8:16] she had an opportunity
[8:19] to turn down what the devil had spoken
[8:22] to her or
[8:24] to accept it that was a golden
[8:28] opportunity
[8:29] to accept the word
[8:33] you accept the word
[8:36] but you see she lost that opportunity
[8:41] when she decided to hear from the Devils
[8:47] you see that was the scene
[9:46] and believed what God Said Yes
[9:49] foreign
[10:49] was
[10:55] not known to hide before always
[10:59] she only got an idea to do it
[11:03] after she had believed what the devil
[11:06] said
[11:08] and you remember how we went through
[11:10] that on Sunday we went through up the
[11:13] process
[11:16] the legal process of the prosecution of
[11:19] an offender
[11:22] when when of course when you've seen
[11:25] when Eve transgressed also Adam came and
[11:27] took part of it
[11:31] and so they were all seen as before God
[11:35] but then you see in the following the
[11:39] laws or the legal processes
[11:47] their life was doomed
[11:50] remember I told you that you see the
[11:52] first one was in his investigation of
[11:54] the crime
[11:57] when someone when an offender is going
[12:00] to be prosecuted the first thing that
[12:02] they do is to investigate on them
[12:04] [Music]
[12:07] then the second is to arrest the
[12:09] suspects
[12:11] the third is you know to be prosecuted
[12:16] the third is to be arraigned before a
[12:19] judge
[12:21] and then the fifth is to now the trial
[12:28] to find out whether they are guilty or
[12:30] not guilty
[12:33] and if they are found guilty then the
[12:36] judge will centers
[12:44] and then they will be they will be given
[12:47] a punishment
[12:50] because they were found guilty
[12:54] of course this punishment can be given
[12:56] but if this person wants to appeal then
[12:58] they can appealand
[13:06] but you see when Adam sinned
[13:10] the punishment was giveness do you
[13:14] remember what the punishment was
[13:18] what was the punishment
[13:22] can somebody say it whatever
[13:28] how many were here on Sunday
[13:31] what was it
[13:33] death
[13:35] when Adam seen when Adam and Eve sin
[13:38] Adam
[13:39] they were supposed to suffer the
[13:41] ultimate punishment for their sins
[13:45] because the Bible says the son of sins
[13:48] that Soul shall die
[13:55] it shall suffer the ultimate punishment
[14:01] so you see when Adam and Eve sinned
[14:05] they were supposed to suffer the
[14:07] ultimate punishment of their sins
[14:25] because all that were born after the
[14:28] manner of Adam's children were born in
[14:31] sins
[14:33] foreign
[15:27] [Music]
[15:32] [Applause]
[15:33] even if it was his own son
[15:37] Adam was supposed to die
[15:40] the Judgment was already passed
[15:43] before the scene was done
[15:46] because you know even the the the the
[15:49] judge himself
[15:51] he is bound by the law
[15:54] he doesn't give judgment according to
[15:56] his soul
[15:59] judgment according to what was already
[16:01] given in the Lord
[16:04] so you see Jesus or God himself
[16:08] as a righteous
[16:11] he had to judge Adam and hold his rest
[16:22] Amen to death
[16:25] now we know that we all are from the
[16:27] lineage of Adam
[16:30] so we were all condemned today
[16:33] we are all sinners
[16:37] there is no amount of things
[16:40] that we can do that can redeem us from
[16:43] that day
[16:46] Christian Believers I want you to
[16:48] understand
[16:49] there is nothing we can do
[16:52] that is
[16:56] redeem us from that day
[17:00] that is why it had to take God himself
[17:09] that's why the devil was so happy
[17:12] because he knew that this race is
[17:15] finished
[17:16] there is no way they can be redeemed
[17:19] because according to the Lord
[17:22] [Music]
[17:23] the penalty for dies
[17:49] [Music]
[18:02] [Music]
[18:40] foreign foreign
[19:13] hallelujah amen
[19:15] so that in him we would become the
[19:19] righteousness of God
[19:23] that we would be made acceptable to him
[19:29] and blessed in a right relationship with
[19:32] him
[19:35] by his gracious loving kindness
[19:40] Hallelujah man if God did not become
[19:44] amen if he did not make his son sin
[19:50] we would have been lost forever
[19:53] that is why we are not saved because of
[19:56] our own words
[20:00] because of his work on the cross
[20:07] you will stop saying should I do this or
[20:10] should I not do that
[20:14] you will know like what Apostle Paul
[20:17] says
[20:18] all things are lawful unto me Amen to
[20:22] your Navy and some agenda but not all
[20:24] things are experience
[20:27] Hallelujah man there is nothing wrong
[20:29] for me to do okay
[20:31] I can't do all things
[20:35] but I must not do all things
[20:38] because all things are defined not to
[20:41] hang up you're not to be seen by what
[20:43] I'm going to do I'm going to do such
[20:46] things that give my God my savior My
[20:49] Redeemer Glory
[20:54] that is what Grace is
[21:00] you will not even have this mentality of
[21:03] works in your head
[21:06] [Music]
[21:08] on our behalf
[21:11] investigations were made on Jesus
[21:15] yes if Jesus Paid It All for us yes
[21:19] Jesus had to go through the whole
[21:21] process
[21:23] hallelujah amen he had to go through the
[21:26] whole process
[21:28] on our behalf investigations were made
[21:32] on Jesus
[21:35] he was arrested as a criminal yeah
[21:39] right on our behalf he was prosecuted
[21:46] he was arraigned before a judge
[21:51] he was sentenced to death he said it
[21:54] will work by crucification
[21:59] he never appealed the case
[22:06] Hallelujah man he never built a case
[22:10] he accepted the Judgment
[22:13] because he knew he was
[22:28] he was doing it for somebody
[22:32] he was doing it for somebody
[22:38] he didn't care how heavy the price was
[22:42] I didn't care how heavy the sentence is
[22:47] to himself I have to pay this ultimate
[22:50] price
[22:54] because of somebody because of my own
[22:57] rest
[22:58] he became a brother
[23:01] can you imagine God himself
[23:04] became our brothers
[23:06] so that he can be able to die for for us
[23:10] remember it had to be our brothers
[23:32] foreign foreign
[25:32] was in the book foreign
[26:19] but
[26:21] it is your brothers
[26:22] because now he has redeemed it with his
[26:25] money
[26:28] if your brother redeems it is
[26:32] right he has a right to do with whatever
[26:37] he wants to do with it
[26:40] hallelujah amen oh glory amen when Adam
[26:45] lost Adam we are feed what his brother
[26:47] came down
[26:49] Jesus Christ yes and when he came down
[26:52] she paid the price
[26:55] he paid a price by his death on Calvary
[27:00] and now whatever he paid
[27:04] belong to him let me tell you he paid
[27:08] for me I am the one he redeems
[27:13] that means what I am not a property of
[27:17] the devil anymore
[27:19] I am the property of Jesus Christ
[27:27] that the devil could not be able to say
[27:29] anything else
[27:31] when it ever brings you sickness
[27:36] to tell him
[27:38] take your hands away from God's Property
[28:03] [Applause]
[28:12] if the devil takes something from you
[28:16] right to redeem it back
[28:19] because the price has already been gone
[28:23] I say hallelujah
[28:27] [Music]
[28:28] if the devil takes your joy away
[28:37] Jesus on our behalf did every the whole
[28:40] Pro he went through the whole process
[28:41] yes
[28:44] and we could read a lot of scriptures
[28:49] I wonder let's
[28:52] it will take a lot of time but I could
[28:54] just give you a few Snippets here and
[28:55] there
[28:56] let us let us look at a few of those
[28:59] processes as Jesus was going through
[29:00] them
[29:05] as he
[29:07] was going through the legal procedure
[29:12] let us look in the Book of Mark
[29:28] it says and immediately while he yet
[29:32] speak cometh Judas one of the twelve and
[29:35] with him a great multitude with swords
[29:37] and staves from the chief priests and
[29:39] the scribes and the elders and he that
[29:41] betrayed him and had given them a token
[29:45] saying whomsoever shall kiss that shame
[29:49] that's that same is he take him and lead
[29:52] him away safely and as soon as he was
[29:54] come he goes straight away to him and
[29:56] said master master and kiss to him and
[29:59] they laid him they laid their hands on
[30:02] him and took him and one of the them
[30:04] that stood by by Drew a sword and smote
[30:07] a servant of them I priest
[30:10] and cut off his ear and Jesus answered
[30:14] and said unto them are ye come out as
[30:16] against a thief with swords and with
[30:18] steps to take me I was daily with you in
[30:21] the temple teaching and he took me not
[30:23] but the scriptures must be fulfilled and
[30:26] they all forsook him and fled and they
[30:28] followed him and he continues on and on
[30:31] and here we noticed that when they came
[30:32] to arrest Jesus
[30:35] he told them I was with you in the
[30:39] temple the whole time
[30:42] why didn't you catch me why didn't you
[30:45] arrest me today you are coming to me
[30:47] with steps and Spears and knives
[30:51] but he says all right the word must be
[30:54] fulfilled
[30:55] what was the word which was being
[30:57] fulfilled
[30:59] a criminal was being arrested it wasn't
[31:03] Jesus being arrested
[31:05] it was you being arrested
[31:09] Jesus was doing it on your behalf yes
[31:14] then the other procedure comes the
[31:17] prosecution
[31:21] let's look at Matthew Matthew 26.
[31:27] Matthew 26
[31:32] verses 57
[31:35] he says
[31:38] and the they that had laid hold on Jesus
[31:41] led him away to Caiaphas the high priest
[31:44] where the scribes and the elders were
[31:46] assembled
[31:48] but Peter followed him a far off under
[31:50] the high priest's Palace and went in and
[31:53] sat with the servants to to see the end
[31:56] now the chief priests and the elders and
[31:59] oh the cancer sowed false witness
[32:02] against Jesus to put him to death but
[32:05] found none yeah though many false
[32:07] Witnesses came yet found they none at
[32:11] the last came to false Witnesses and we
[32:14] can go on and on and on and on but I
[32:16] want you also to look at Luke Chapter
[32:17] 22.
[32:22] you can write this down and read them
[32:24] later at your own time
[32:31] I wanted to look at Luke 22 verses 6 to
[32:35] 6. okay
[32:40] foreign
[33:21] [Music]
[33:38] he was prosecuted as a Son of God yes
[33:48] Adam Adam the Son of God
[33:52] Jesus had to be his brother yes
[34:03] are you following me
[34:06] now I want you to see when he was being
[34:08] arraigned before a judge
[34:11] Luke 23.
[34:16] and you know I was reading one of the uh
[34:18] articles I think about a year ago
[34:23] a legal officer in a lawyer in Kenya
[34:27] Kenya who said that he was taking the
[34:32] Roman government and the Israeli
[34:34] government to court government
[34:40] because they prosecuted Jesus in a wrong
[34:44] way
[34:44] [Music]
[34:47] jump
[34:48] but they just
[34:50] told told them to take that that they
[34:53] they don't have jurisdiction to hear
[34:56] that case
[35:00] and so he even tried to take it in the
[35:02] in in the international court
[35:05] so they also could not file it
[35:09] but to me I think it's lack of
[35:11] understanding
[35:14] you see Jesus did everything yes
[35:19] even when they were Prosecuting they
[35:22] found that indeed he was not guilty
[35:24] Never by anybody
[35:27] he looked in the three verse
[35:30] look look at it in your Bible
[35:34] and the whole multitude of them arose
[35:36] and led him unto pilate and they began
[35:39] to accuse him saying we found his fellow
[35:42] we felt we found this fellow perverting
[35:45] the nation and forbidden to give tribute
[35:47] to Caesar saying that he himself is
[35:49] Christ a king and pilate asked him
[35:51] saying that without the king of the Jews
[35:54] and he answered and said thou sayest it
[35:57] then said pilate to the chief priests
[36:00] and to the people I find no fault in
[36:02] this man and they were the more Fierce
[36:07] saying his tariffs are the people
[36:09] teaching throttled the jewelry
[36:13] the beginning From Galilee to this place
[36:15] and you see when he was taken before a
[36:19] judge yes
[36:22] are you hearing me Church what did the
[36:25] judge say again I find him not guilty
[36:29] see that and song
[36:31] and if you continue on from verse 6 to
[36:34] 12.
[36:36] and and and and also up to verse 25 not
[36:41] true
[36:42] you will find that the people say no
[36:46] even if he's not guilty
[36:49] we want you to crucify him
[36:53] we want you to make him guilty
[36:57] and the man washed his hands
[37:01] and he said that is
[37:07] no problem
[37:10] a bonus
[38:08] the king told them
[38:11] foreign
[38:45] [Music]
[39:04] foreign
[39:25] [Music]
[40:01] foreign
[40:15] [Laughter]
[40:32] there is nothing you can do
[40:36] to worry Choice none of your Works
[40:42] God will give you eternal life
[40:46] there is only one thing that is only one
[40:50] thing that had to happen
[40:55] Jesus had to be incarcerated yes
[41:00] Jesus had to be condemned yesterday
[41:03] Jesus did it on behalf of God
[41:08] and when parabas was being set free
[41:12] Jesus was being caught yes at that
[41:16] moment listen at that moment
[41:20] hey even if pilate
[41:24] there was no way
[41:27] to release Jesus
[41:30] the moment Barabas was set free
[41:35] there is a it's your childhood
[41:51] amen without the destiny of Jesus
[41:54] was being accomplished
[41:58] Jesus came on yes to replace barabases
[42:06] if Jesus was not caught yes
[42:13] but Jesus died yes
[42:16] yes
[42:18] the action of Jesus yielding himself
[42:25] was the price for barabas's freedom
[42:30] because Jesus died on the cross
[42:33] and paid the price for your freedom
[42:39] hallelujah amen how many believe that
[42:42] how many believe that
[42:44] Jesus paid for your freedom yes he
[42:47] accessory he died the fact that you
[42:50] could be free
[42:53] Hallelujah and he did it willingly
[42:58] anything Barabbas could do
[43:03] so in appreciation to what Jesus
[43:11] Paid It All yes
[43:15] the message
[43:17] says the blood of Jesus Christ
[43:25] that makes me white as snow oh God no
[43:29] other phone I know that is
[43:53] Jesus Paid It All yes
[43:57] [Applause]
[44:09] hallelujah amen
[44:12] and when I read this you know when that
[44:15] is in Romans 8 1 I was like Wow
[44:20] there is there for now no condemnation
[44:28] and then the spirit of God came on me
[44:29] and I wrote I said we cannot come in the
[44:31] Judgment ever
[44:33] um
[44:36] did you hear that we cannot come into
[44:41] judgment ever
[44:42] said
[44:45] I cannot come into judgment
[44:49] we as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:51] are not here praying coming to church
[44:54] praying
[44:56] dressing well to do this
[44:59] we know so that we can not we can fail
[45:02] not we can we can go to the eternal life
[45:06] we are not Muslims we don't buy eternal
[45:09] life by our works

[45:26] bride of Christ listen the bride of
[45:28] Christ does not go into Heaven by their
[45:30] works
[45:34] is there anyone hearing me
[45:36] [Music]
[45:39] what takes us into eternal life
[45:46] is the price
[45:52] and that blood
[45:54] where is that blood
[45:56] it is in the word
[46:01] when you receive the message
[46:07] and the life behind it
[46:10] which is the Holy Spirit
[46:15] foreign
[46:46] I don't want you to miss this mystery
[46:49] that the moment you receive the message
[46:57] you have received your attention
[47:04] why why because you have received the
[47:07] blood
[47:08] the price has been paid
[47:12] is the confirmation of the tokens
[47:15] [Music]
[47:23] the moment that blood was put on the
[47:26] door on the door knobs
[47:31] it was a clear
[47:35] signification
[47:41] Hallelujah the man is
[47:46] under the seals
[47:50] no one was going to die inside
[47:55] but the other homes
[47:57] died
[47:59] because they were not eternally
[48:04] your
[48:34] a new
[48:35] manager if you are the paid Insurance
[48:38] [Music]
[48:46] when Jesus died on the cross when he
[48:50] paid the price on the cross and he gave
[48:53] to us a portion of his life
[48:56] it is more than an insurance
[49:00] it is
[49:03] a Blessed Assurance
[49:07] Hallelujah that in case of something
[49:10] we will make it
[49:14] in the case of something what I want you
[49:16] to say you will go to the rapture
[49:20] hmm
[49:25] and that's why he says
[49:27] that are for now no condemnation
[49:32] now not tomorrow but now there is no
[49:37] condemnation everybody comes condemned
[49:40] Jesus was condemned yes yes
[49:43] and he served the sentence
[49:58] whose life has been hidden in Christ
[50:05] I say no condemnation
[50:08] you will never come before
[50:12] hallelujah amen people speak about the
[50:15] white Throne judges
[50:19] will never come before the white Throne
[50:22] judgment um
[50:43] not me
[50:45] judgment
[51:07] [Music]
[51:40] I'm speaking the actions of the Bride
[51:45] The Works of the Bride the others
[51:47] they will come before they went through
[51:50] again
[51:51] the Bible says
[51:56] The Book of Life
[52:15] um where will the bride be um
[52:20] and why would they reject according to
[52:21] their words
[52:24] because they rejected the work of Christ
[52:27] on the cross
[52:30] [Music]
[52:40] the word
[52:41] and the Holy Spirit
[52:44] the Holy Spirit and the word the holy
[52:47] spirit is the life of the world
[52:50] but if anybody is here on Earth
[52:59] and they receive their life in their
[53:01] songs
[53:09] the Bible says
[53:29] they went through judgment
[53:32] another proof that we are not going to
[53:34] stand before
[53:36] it's because
[53:38] it happens
[53:41] much later
[53:45] you see what is going to happen first
[53:52] they following me after the Rapture
[53:57] then of course there will
[54:00] um the the the the Earth will go into
[54:03] the judgments of God
[54:05] [Music]
[54:08] the beasts will take over
[54:13] and that's where we see a lot of things
[54:16] happening there
[54:18] but at that time
[54:23] Jesus Christ yes Christ will come back
[54:26] again
[54:27] the Bible says somebody again behind him
[54:31] was many I would call it that way there
[54:35] were many of his Saints

[55:40] animals
[55:45] the Bible calls it
[55:57] will be also a ruler
[56:01] he will be ruling together with Christ
[56:04] that will be the time
[56:07] which will fulfill the promise of the
[56:10] Messiah continuing on the throne of
[56:12] David okay
[56:18] do you remember when Jesus came yes and
[56:22] the people saw him the Jews
[56:32] he was the Messiah who had come to
[56:37] redeem them from the Roman powers
[56:40] and then sit on the throne of David
[56:43] forever and ever
[56:45] yes he was the one
[56:52] they asked him
[56:56] for the restoration of the Kingdom
[57:01] foreign
[58:01] Bantu
[58:22] when the Rapture happens
[58:27] there will be
[58:28] what we call the Armageddon
[58:30] afterwards
[58:33] the third world war
[58:35] that will destroy everything
[58:41] you see these things happening between
[58:43] Russia America China
[58:46] they are coming to a showdown
[58:50] but it will come after the bright
[58:52] disruption again
[58:55] and when they destroy everything
[59:00] destroys everything
[59:05] there will be people
[59:08] think they are very intelligence
[59:10] they have Bankers
[59:14] where they can escape and even nuclear
[59:16] power will not destroyed
[59:26] and they will hide away foreign
[1:00:39] what will happen
[1:00:54] as farmers
[1:01:02] yet oh my goodness yet before the
[1:01:05] destruction of the world
[1:01:09] they were The Bill Gates
[1:01:13] they are the ones who could afford
[1:01:14] bankers
[1:01:19] but in that our civilization
[1:01:25] and they will be making fire with stones
[1:01:30] they would have gone back to Stone Age
[1:01:34] and guess who will be the Lord's over
[1:01:36] there
[1:01:39] and we shall have such powers
[1:01:42] that they can't understand us
[1:01:44] somewhere
[1:01:57] but indeed we shall have come from
[1:02:00] heaven
[1:02:00] but originally we are from here
[1:02:04] but they won't understand
[1:02:12] when we are in that in that in that
[1:02:15] beautiful city
[1:02:17] before we say anything like when we want
[1:02:21] something

[1:08:03] helped you
[1:08:04] then

[1:08:12] and believeth on himself
[1:08:22] oh my man can you say this with me and
[1:08:25] shall not and shall not come into

[1:08:59] helping the moment Christ died yes we
[1:09:02] have energy to count really was put into
[1:09:04] Force when you believed him
[1:09:10] we know that we have passed from Death
[1:09:12] until Jesus Christ
[1:09:19] we love the
[1:09:21] brethreno or Uganda see the love is not
[1:09:24] his brother abideth in death
[1:09:27] that's why among the Believers we really
[1:09:30] have love for one one for the yard
[1:09:33] let me tell you I have been in another
[1:09:37] church before I believe the message
[1:09:40] but I can tell you from good authority
[1:09:44] that all over the world I've never seen
[1:09:47] a group of people that love each other
[1:09:49] more than disbelievers

[1:10:20] and the Bible says this is how we are
[1:10:23] able to know
[1:10:24] we have passed from days to life
[1:10:28] because we love the Brethren
[1:10:31] he that love is not his brother abides
[1:10:34] in death
[1:10:37] whosoever ahead with his brother is a
[1:10:40] murderer

[1:10:44] eternal life abiding in him
