hallelujah hallelujah amen i just want to greet you in the precious name of jesus christ [Music] in the message um the works that i do bear witness of me prophet says it would be a better evidence that you are a christian tonight um [Music] and if we say we have faith and then afraid to step out and claim our faith and put it to work then our face doesn't do us as much good hey guys the bible said that faith without works is dead just as the body without the spirit is dead so is faith works he says you know a living someone is better than one being preached um amen mean it's good to preach inspires he takes us on another level jesus christ emmanuel priest but the prophet says the better someone is the one that is lived and i remember that we spent about actually more than four years uh without leaving in ethiopia with my family and i'm ethiopia we did not get too far we we went okay when we went there we first we were going we thought we were going to leave for six months we tried to work again but then it ended up being years and out of that he said i would chat to you and we were going to return some brothers put me on the side and say you thought we believe the message because you preach that specifically brother mentioned this here who is now the pastor of the church you did not just preach the things but you lived it and it that impacted our life praise m mean and so tonight what do you do we we have somebody who has a testimony today no moon to arena of judaism i live the life of them what ambulate [Music] can preach it singular remember look how much you can shout yourself not how much you can dance but what you have lived over time that's the best summon you can ever preach my sister are you engineer rather than the best someone you can enjoy and the prophet says don't be afraid of your testimony for jesus christ amen mean shed forth your life stand for your convictions that he is the b yes almost four months enough and during the time that mother baby was here a banger organized [Music] he has not yes and so his days of being with us and now uh quickly coming to our close and is intending to travel back home know you can go to our country by the time you go you are all into that you know by the time you want to go you really want to go i don't know why he's here now are you here let me tell you try it one time i i i i i even always say these people are saying they are going to arab countries but it is not bad to go to another country especially if you're going there for the purpose of the work of the lord that's like we went to ethiopia let me tell you would go there be there for a few months oh we would feel homesick food is different the behavior of people is different the life of people is different home in a physical uh place which is different other than this that is ethiopia you know that's where they take a lot of coffee several cups a day but brother baby i'll speak a little more after you're spoken every single but of all the people that i was able the lord allowed us and permitted us to meet in ethiopia ethiopia brothers one them that we [Music] a very uh those of you will justify those that have been around him he's a very humble brother he's the brother that has actually been translating the message into his language called afan or romo and the oromo people are the most popular in ethiopia maybe he will tell us more about that um uh so you know when he received the message the lord blessed upon his heart also to translate it and during the time he has been here in uganda uganda he has finished the church edge book in his language hallelujah amen amen and for a life that god can you know a life that can yield itself to be used of the lord i think it's a noble a number anymore you remember what one was speaking to the young people he has also practiced his fields but he has spent time here amazing doing translation for thousands and millions of people rather than praying for me believe the truth it will not end there come out then we shall all meet with them hallelujah amen understand organized [Music] morning thank you for going again thank you for translation thank you for
