[1:11:07] blood of the new testament which is shed
[1:11:10] for many for the remission of
[1:11:12] sins but I say unto you I will not drink
[1:11:16] henceforth of this fruit of the vine
[1:11:18] until the day when I drink it new with

[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:22] for
[1:12:35] now I also desire to read in the Book of
[1:12:37] Revelation chapter
[1:12:43] 5 5
[1:12:47] 1 to verse
[1:12:52] S
[1:12:57] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:12:59] sat on the throne if you have your lug
[1:13:02] Bible you can really read and follow us
[1:13:04] there and uh uh saw him that sat on the
[1:13:07] throne a book written within and on the
[1:13:09] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[1:13:13] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:13:14] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:13:16] book and to lose the seals thereof and
[1:13:19] no man in heaven knowing Earth neither
[1:13:21] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:13:22] book neither to look their own and I
[1:13:24] wept much because no man was found
[1:13:26] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:13:28] neither to look their own and one of the
[1:13:30] elders said unto me weep not Behold The
[1:13:32] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:13:34] David has prevailed to open the book and
[1:13:36] lose the Seven Seals thereof and I
[1:13:38] beheld an law in the midst of the throne
[1:13:41] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[1:13:43] of the elders stood a lamb as it had
[1:13:45] been slain having seven horns and seven
[1:13:48] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[1:13:50] sent forth into all the Earth verse 7
[1:13:53] and he came and he came and took the
[1:13:56] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:13:58] sat upon the throne praise the name of
[1:14:00] the Lord and so this evening I want to
[1:14:02] speak to you on a commemoration of a
[1:14:05] finished
[1:14:08] work a
[1:14:14] commemoration a commemoration of a
[1:14:16] finished
[1:14:18] work how do you say that a commemoration
[1:14:21] of a finished work
[1:14:30] amen praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:14:33] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen tell
[1:14:36] someone God bless
[1:14:38] you amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:42] amen
[1:14:47] sister all right a commemoration of a
[1:14:50] finished
[1:14:51] work so we see
[1:14:54] there is something just little I want to
[1:14:55] share with
[1:14:57] you perhaps in about um 50
[1:15:01] minutes and then we shall go to the the
[1:15:05] communion amen and uh to those of you
[1:15:07] who missed the communion on the teaching
[1:15:10] on
[1:15:14] communion you missed and unfortunately
[1:15:16] I'm going I'm not going to go back to
[1:15:17] that
[1:15:21] again but perhaps you if you pray the
[1:15:23] Lord can lead me to say something that
[1:15:25] will
[1:15:29] benefit the cup he took the cup he gave
[1:15:34] thanks and he gave it to them
[1:15:37] saying drink ye all of
[1:15:39] it for this is my
[1:15:42] blood of the new
[1:15:44] testament which is shed for many for the
[1:15:47] remion of
[1:15:49] sins now the reason why I've read in the
[1:15:52] Book of Revelation CH
[1:15:55] 5 is because we see here one that is
[1:15:59] Seated on the
[1:16:02] throne and it says in his right
[1:16:06] hand was a
[1:16:09] book and this book was sealed with Seven
[1:16:14] Seals andam says that that was the book
[1:16:17] of
[1:16:21] redemption and I saw a strong angel
[1:16:24] proclaiming with a loud
[1:16:28] voice who is worthy to open the
[1:16:32] book and to lose the seals
[1:16:36] there no man in heaven was
[1:16:40] worthy no man in earth was
[1:16:43] worthy just say what I said no man in
[1:16:45] heaven was
[1:16:47] worthy no man on Earth was
[1:16:50] worthy neither under the Earth
[1:16:54] now not only being
[1:16:56] worthy but there was also no one worthy
[1:17:00] to look upon the
[1:17:06] book and John who we know the prophet of
[1:17:09] God says that he is a type of the
[1:17:15] Bride so John is your
[1:17:18] type John types you and
[1:17:22] me
[1:17:24] and so John when he saw that there was
[1:17:26] no one
[1:17:28] worthy he began
[1:17:31] weeping if you look at verse five if can
[1:17:34] put that for us up
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:37] there and one of the elders said unto me
[1:17:40] weep
[1:17:44] not one of the elders said unto
[1:17:50] me Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:17:56] the root of
[1:17:57] David has
[1:18:00] prevailed to open the
[1:18:04] book and to lose the seals
[1:18:07] there now let us lift this out of the
[1:18:11] Bible let us bring it down here
[1:18:14] today
[1:18:18] 2023 no one was
[1:18:21] worthy to save you out of your
[1:18:24] sin but only
[1:18:26] he the lion the lion of the tribe of
[1:18:30] Judah the root of
[1:18:33] David amen is
[1:18:36] worthy and and he says I
[1:18:40] beheld and and and when John
[1:18:44] looked in in the midst of the
[1:18:48] throne and in the middle of the four
[1:18:51] beasts
[1:18:54] and in the middle of the
[1:18:56] elders there stood a
[1:19:00] lamb and this lamb was as it says as it
[1:19:05] had been
[1:19:09] slain so this lamb was
[1:19:13] slain when John saw
[1:19:17] it are you following me this this
[1:19:19] evening the lamb was already
[1:19:21] slain
[1:19:24] and when was it
[1:19:26] slain remember John was
[1:19:29] seeing
[1:19:31] this in a way of a
[1:19:34] vision and as much as he knows that no
[1:19:37] one was
[1:19:40] worthy but he he was told that the lion
[1:19:43] of the tribe of Judah
[1:19:47] is and when he turned to
[1:19:50] see he saw what a
[1:19:53] lamb I'll read it for you later later on
[1:19:56] here the lamb the lion became the
[1:20:01] lamb who is
[1:20:03] worthy only God is
[1:20:07] worthy there was no there was no
[1:20:10] priest there was no Prophet there was no
[1:20:13] holy
[1:20:15] man that was worthy when Adam and Eve
[1:20:19] sinned Adam could not redeem the Fallen
[1:20:27] the generations after him could
[1:20:31] not no one could redeem the Fallen
[1:20:36] rest and I'll tell you why there was no
[1:20:41] one
[1:20:42] because it had to take
[1:20:49] death
[1:20:50] death of the Redeemer
[1:20:54] because the penalty of
[1:20:57] sin was death that's the ultimate price
[1:21:01] of
[1:21:04] sin and from ad to all the generations
[1:21:07] after
[1:21:09] him they had all Fallen to
[1:21:13] sin we were all Sinners
[1:21:16] by and so and so what would then God do
[1:21:24] because if we are all
[1:21:27] sinners there needed to be one to save
[1:21:29] the
[1:21:32] Sinners but the one that was to
[1:21:36] save had to have ability to
[1:21:41] save you know the scripture which says
[1:21:43] for God who was rich in
[1:21:47] Mercy if you are going to buy someone
[1:21:51] from from his C
[1:21:55] captivity you have to have
[1:21:58] riches you have to have
[1:22:01] ability in order to buy the person who
[1:22:03] is
[1:22:06] imprisoned and
[1:22:09] God and God had to have
[1:22:12] riches God had to have
[1:22:15] wealth God had to have
[1:22:17] ability in order to buy off a sinner
[1:22:20] from his sin
[1:22:24] and there was no one worthy to
[1:22:26] do only God was
[1:22:29] worthy you know what he did he God
[1:22:33] himself decided to
[1:22:36] die but I ask you a question how could
[1:22:40] God
[1:22:41] die because the Bible says God is a
[1:22:45] spirit and a spirit
[1:22:48] die Spirit cannot
[1:22:51] die so what did God do God put on
[1:22:55] flesh and he came down Among
[1:22:58] Us in order to pay the ultimate
[1:23:04] price the ultimate price of
[1:23:08] sin but you see before he could
[1:23:12] die he became the
[1:23:17] lamb before he could
[1:23:19] die he had to come from spiritual form
[1:23:25] to human
[1:23:26] form he had to wear a body like of yours
[1:23:31] and so that he can be able to bleed and
[1:23:36] die and people did not understand who he
[1:23:41] was because they did not understand the
[1:23:44] mystery of
[1:23:47] godliness what is the mystery of
[1:23:51] godliness that God
[1:23:53] himself the creator of Heaven and
[1:23:56] Earth could humble
[1:24:00] himself into a form
[1:24:05] of
[1:24:08] humility
[1:24:10] Simplicity God came down to
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:17] Simplicity and in that way of
[1:24:20] Simplicity he reveal himself to the
[1:24:23] human
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:27] race and it's a great mystery
[1:24:32] friends we see Jesus being
[1:24:34] baptized someone asked me a
[1:24:37] question why was Jesus being
[1:24:40] baptized did he have
[1:24:42] sin no Jesus did not have
[1:24:44] sin but before a lamb could be
[1:24:51] sacrificed that lamb had to be washed
[1:24:55] first and so Jesus was a lamb of
[1:24:59] God Away The Sins of the
[1:25:02] world and so that's why he came
[1:25:04] down and he was
[1:25:07] baptized he was being washed and being
[1:25:11] prepared for the
[1:25:14] sacrifice and I'm so glad that today we
[1:25:16] can say Jesus is
[1:25:21] Worthy
[1:25:23] and in the message the revelation of
[1:25:25] Jesus
[1:25:27] Christ would you like an old an Old
[1:25:30] Testament
[1:25:33] type let us go back to Garden of
[1:25:36] aen when the first news came to the to
[1:25:39] to to Glory that the son Adam had been
[1:25:45] lost did God send an
[1:25:48] angel I ask a question did God send an
[1:25:51] angel did God send a
[1:25:55] son did he send another one like unto
[1:26:00] us did God send a
[1:26:04] son did God send someone like unto
[1:26:11] us some people are keeping quiet because
[1:26:13] you have to understand the mystery of
[1:26:16] God and the prophet says
[1:26:19] no he came himself
[1:26:24] to redeem that lost
[1:26:27] son Hallelujah God did not entrust his
[1:26:30] Plan of Salvation to
[1:26:35] another he trusted only
[1:26:39] himself God was made flesh and dwelt
[1:26:42] Among
[1:26:43] Us and redeemed us unto
[1:26:47] himself we are saved by the blood of
[1:26:51] God no man can save
[1:26:54] us Buddha could not save us mhamad could
[1:26:57] not save us CH cannot save us no human
[1:27:02] being can save us Moses could not save
[1:27:05] us abah could not sa are you hearing me
[1:27:10] could not serve us even Adam himself
[1:27:14] could not serve us even Bram could not
[1:27:17] save us no man could save us God himself
[1:27:23] he came down to save the human
[1:27:27] race he trusted only
[1:27:32] himself Hallelujah am I'm so glad God
[1:27:36] could not trust
[1:27:38] me trust you but he trusted
[1:27:42] himself he said I'm going to save
[1:27:45] you by
[1:27:48] myself hallelujah amen God was made
[1:27:53] flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us
[1:27:57] unto
[1:27:59] himself we are saved by the blood of
[1:28:04] God we are not saved by a blood of an
[1:28:07] Angel we are not saved by a blood of
[1:28:11] Gabriel or the blood of Michael the
[1:28:13] angel now we are
[1:28:16] saved amen by the blood of God
[1:28:19] himself we not set by even
[1:28:23] Mary there are many men and women God
[1:28:26] has used in
[1:28:29] history
[1:28:30] prophets and you know
[1:28:33] prophetes anointed men and
[1:28:37] women you know there are angels that God
[1:28:39] has
[1:28:41] used but when it comes to
[1:28:45] Redemption
[1:28:46] area can only be handled by God
[1:28:51] himself he cannot trust anybody
[1:28:54] else because he knows no one else has
[1:28:57] ability
[1:28:59] to but God
[1:29:01] himself I tell you brother sister there
[1:29:05] is no
[1:29:06] way any of
[1:29:09] those whose names were on the Book of
[1:29:13] Life can remain
[1:29:16] unsaved because God swear by
[1:29:19] himself I am going to serve them
[1:29:23] to redeem them and when he open the book
[1:29:27] and he lose the
[1:29:30] SE I want to tell you what
[1:29:33] happened that's why he sends a
[1:29:35] prophet let me tell you the work of a
[1:29:38] prophet the work of a prophet in this
[1:29:42] work of
[1:29:43] redemption is simply to call out the
[1:29:46] names of those who are on the
[1:29:50] register
[1:29:54] hallelujah amen who wrote those
[1:29:57] names God wrote those names who open and
[1:30:01] revealed things God did
[1:30:04] that God did that what's the work of a
[1:30:09] minister when I come to you to preach to
[1:30:11] you right
[1:30:12] now I'm only I'm only telling you what
[1:30:15] is
[1:30:17] here I am not saving You by preaching to
[1:30:20] you telling you you are
[1:30:24] saved by what is written down
[1:30:27] here and when I preach inspiration comes
[1:30:31] upon
[1:30:32] me and it comes and Strikes you and
[1:30:37] like that's the
[1:30:39] truth what happens when that happens it
[1:30:43] means you have had your name being
[1:30:47] called and then he begin saying
[1:30:50] amen I believe that
[1:30:53] that is my name being
[1:30:55] called and that's why we are here
[1:30:57] friends because our name
[1:31:02] was no the devil cannot unall
[1:31:05] us
[1:31:07] hallelujah because I'm called amen by
[1:31:10] Jehovah God the devil cannot remove
[1:31:14] me my name is in the
[1:31:16] book tell your neighbor my name is in
[1:31:19] the
[1:31:20] book Hallelujah
[1:31:22] our names were put
[1:31:24] there before we were
[1:31:27] born even whatever you did in your
[1:31:30] life
[1:31:32] knew but still your name was
[1:31:35] there because he
[1:31:37] knows when he calls you you will respond
[1:31:43] to
[1:31:45] amen hallelujah
[1:31:49] amen praise the name of the Lord amen he
[1:31:53] became the lamb in order to shed his
[1:31:57] blood and enter into the veil with
[1:32:00] it consider
[1:32:03] this since it is the blood of
[1:32:07] God it is the it is perfect
[1:32:10] blood and if the perfect blood is losing
[1:32:14] us from power and if the perfect blood
[1:32:17] is losing us from the power and bondage
[1:32:20] and defilement of
[1:32:30] listen listen carefully if it is the
[1:32:32] perfect

[1:40:02] God then you have received
[1:40:05] salvation if you received the power of
[1:40:07] the Holy

[1:40:13] been given once and for
[1:40:16] all to all those that would believe and
[1:40:18] accept
[1:40:19] it
[1:40:22] and in the message the
[1:40:25] communion he says it's not given for the
[1:40:28] purpose that many people think it
[1:40:32] is communion is not given for the
[1:40:34] purpose that many people think it
[1:40:42] is it's taugh by a certain denin of
[1:40:47] church that communion is called the last
[1:40:52] rights the last rights things that when
[1:40:55] someone is going to die what they do
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:06] last that it pertains to
[1:41:10] Salvation communion does not pertain to
[1:41:15] Salvation can I hear an Amen on
[1:41:18] that communion does not give you
[1:41:23] salvation whether you take it in your
[1:41:27] death or what it does not have nothing
[1:41:31] to do with your
[1:41:33] salvation it is a
[1:41:38] commemoration Jesus said in the
[1:41:41] gospel he said this do in remembrance of
[1:41:47] me not in leaning or pointings to
[1:41:50] Salvation
[1:41:56] but it is in
[1:41:59] commemoration of a finished
[1:42:02] work that has already been done in
[1:42:05] You by the holy
[1:42:07] spirit amen amen the work has already
[1:42:10] been done in
[1:42:12] you so whenever we take
[1:42:15] communion it's not like saying oh we are
[1:42:17] now going to be
[1:42:19] saved no it does not Ser
[1:42:21] us but we do it in
[1:42:26] commemoration of a finished
[1:42:30] work that has been done in Me In
[1:42:35] You by the Holy
[1:42:38] Spirit it is a
[1:42:41] commemoration now it's just like water
[1:42:45] baptism what baptism to is not does not
[1:42:47] save
[1:42:49] you you
[1:42:52] see I want you to know
[1:42:55] friends there nothing that we do that
[1:42:58] saves
[1:43:01] us everything that we
[1:43:04] do points to the fact that we are
[1:43:10] saved do you say amen amen if you refuse
[1:43:14] water
[1:43:15] baptism it shows you are not
[1:43:19] saved how do know that you are
[1:43:21] saved if you receive the
[1:43:24] word the whole word of
[1:43:27] God then it means you are
[1:43:30] saved because you have
[1:43:32] faith without faith it is impossible to
[1:43:36] see
[1:43:37] God right am so it is impossible to
[1:43:40] please
[1:43:42] God you must have
[1:43:45] faith in order to be
[1:43:48] saved and we are saved
[1:43:51] by
[1:43:52] Grace it is the gift of
[1:43:56] God through
[1:43:59] faith by grace through
[1:44:02] faith are you understand what I'm saying
[1:44:05] now that faith is blessed in your
[1:44:10] soul by the Holy
[1:44:12] Spirit if you don't have the Holy
[1:44:15] Spirit you don't have
[1:44:18] faith the faith of the son of God
[1:44:22] but if you have that faith in your
[1:44:25] soul then you will say Amen to
[1:44:27] everyone Amen to everyone Amen to
[1:44:31] everyone that shows you are
[1:44:36] saved you get to water
[1:44:39] baptism because you are
[1:44:44] saved sisters you throw away
[1:44:49] trousers because
[1:44:54] Brothers you throw away those the boys
[1:44:57] are wearing these
[1:45:01] days you begin walking like whatever you
[1:45:05] throw those things away because you are
[1:45:09] saved sisters you throw away
[1:45:12] makeup because you are
[1:45:14] saved we do
[1:45:17] communion because we are
[1:45:19] Sav thing we do as
[1:45:22] Believers we do it because we
[1:45:26] believe we don't do it to
[1:45:29] believe if you have received Revelation
[1:45:31] say
[1:45:35] Amen we don't do it to
[1:45:37] believe but we do it because we are
[1:45:43] believers that's why Jesus told Peter if
[1:45:47] you don't want me to wash your
[1:45:49] feet not a part of
[1:45:52] me so if you don't take
[1:45:54] communion is a clear sign you are not a
[1:45:58] part of
[1:46:01] him but if you part of
[1:46:04] him oh you will Sur of
[1:46:08] it you will partake of
[1:46:10] it praise the name of the Lord amen is
[1:46:14] someone receiving Revelation tonight say
[1:46:18] Amen it is
[1:46:22] commemoration all right amen I have a
[1:46:25] few more quotes here that I thought were
[1:46:26] very important for you now listen same
[1:46:29] message he says notice we want to go
[1:46:32] back and
[1:46:33] think Paul here is referring back to an
[1:46:36] Old Testament
[1:46:43] character in The Book of
[1:46:45] Genesis we take up the life of
[1:46:48] Abraham from the
[1:46:50] 12th chapter of
[1:46:53] Genesis God giving Abraham the
[1:46:56] promise and through Abraham would come
[1:46:58] the righteous
[1:47:01] seat and Abraham has believed by by many
[1:47:04] to be a Jew he was
[1:47:10] not when I read this I
[1:47:13] said many people believe that Abraham
[1:47:15] was a Jew but he
[1:47:19] was abrah was no
[1:47:24] Israelite you are
[1:47:26] quiet a prophet says he was
[1:47:29] not Abraham was a
[1:47:32] gentile a child a
[1:47:36] child from the city
[1:47:39] of and he became God's
[1:47:43] servant because he was different from
[1:47:45] anyone
[1:47:47] else but because of the election of God
[1:47:53] hallelujah amen are you not so glad yes
[1:47:57] sir you were like others but because of
[1:47:59] the election of God you are the Bride of
[1:48:02] Jesus
[1:48:04] Christ hallelujah
[1:48:07] hallelujah you are not
[1:48:09] saved because you are a good
[1:48:13] person you are saved because Christ
[1:48:16] chose
[1:48:19] you no man seeks
[1:48:23] God I God
[1:48:26] I no man seeks
[1:48:29] God God seeks
[1:48:33] man if God loves
[1:48:36] you he so
[1:48:39] you and you are
[1:48:41] here and if you try to run
[1:48:44] away God will seek
[1:48:46] you God will seek you until he finds you
[1:48:50] you you cannot run
[1:48:53] away tell your neighbor you cannot run
[1:48:57] away run away my sister here you cannot
[1:49:00] run away if God saw you in him and God
[1:49:05] chose you in him then God s you because
[1:49:09] he loved you and you cannot sleep away
[1:49:12] from
[1:49:13] him hallelujah amen you are his and he's
[1:49:18] yours if you don't like
[1:49:20] it you better like
[1:49:23] it
[1:49:25] because you he will love
[1:49:28] you he will love you and the more you
[1:49:31] run away from him the more he will seek
[1:49:34] after
[1:49:35] you that's why I've seen people who have
[1:49:39] said my life has been a
[1:49:42] mess ever since I left
[1:49:44] Christ if God loves you and you
[1:49:48] backslide from the church
[1:49:50] there is nothing that you do will
[1:49:55] prosper why because you are his
[1:49:58] child he wants you in his
[1:50:01] house you cannot sleep away you cannot
[1:50:05] run away you may try to you may try to
[1:50:10] hide but if you are his and he is
[1:50:14] yours sin can never bu you
[1:50:17] completely because there is a seed of
[1:50:19] God in
[1:50:21] When sin bies you
[1:50:23] sister the SE of God in you will
[1:50:26] germinate so there is no way a seed of
[1:50:29] God can get
[1:50:32] lost you may have
[1:50:35] wounds out of trying to run
[1:50:39] away and you'll be a wounded child of
[1:50:45] God but you will still be a child of
[1:50:49] God
[1:50:50] so I don't know about you but as for me
[1:50:54] I don't want to have any wounds because
[1:50:55] of
[1:50:58] running if God takes you by the
[1:51:01] hand and you try to run
[1:51:03] away come on brother try it try to run
[1:51:08] away by the time you run
[1:51:10] away your hand will be
[1:51:18] twisted
[1:51:21] not
[1:51:22] going not
[1:51:23] going and by the time you
[1:51:27] settle now saying yes papa God I'm yours
[1:51:31] and your
[1:51:32] mine but your hand has
[1:51:34] [Applause]
[1:51:37] wounds as for me I don't want to
[1:51:41] fight I want just to come to him and say
[1:51:45] papa God I love
[1:51:46] you please take me receive me as you
[1:51:50] called
[1:51:51] me
[1:51:53] Hallelujah but a child of God cannot be
[1:51:57] lost I don't know about you but to me I
[1:51:59] feel this one excites me so
[1:52:06] much the gra you cannot get lost no
[1:52:09] matter
[1:52:12] what te and try whatever it you cannot
[1:52:15] get lost
[1:52:18] amen God six
[1:52:21] man Jesus said no man can come to me
[1:52:23] except my father draws him
[1:52:27] first and if we could stop just for a
[1:52:29] few
[1:52:30] moments and realize the great
[1:52:33] importance of that one
[1:52:37] thing that it was God who chose
[1:52:40] you not willing that you should
[1:52:44] perish but give to
[1:52:47] you the
[1:52:48] opportunity
[1:52:50] and called
[1:52:53] you and elected
[1:52:55] you to be his
[1:52:58] servant what could be more precious than
[1:53:01] that without you having a
[1:53:08] choice I know we make
[1:53:11] choices but I do not choose
[1:53:15] him I chose him because he chose
[1:53:18] me
[1:53:21] listen listen understand
[1:53:22] this God did not Choose
[1:53:25] You Even if you choose
[1:53:28] him it is for
[1:53:32] nothing we see
[1:53:34] Jesus he
[1:53:37] came he
[1:53:40] called Peter he called John he called
[1:53:44] one by one chose them one by one and
[1:53:48] then this woman came
[1:53:50] son of David have mercy on
[1:53:54] me uh you dog why are you looking
[1:54:02] for
[1:54:09] Words
[1:54:11] sincerely he chose some and left
[1:54:14] others he went at the pool
[1:54:18] of one man there
[1:54:24] he looked at many
[1:54:27] others some others were touching
[1:54:30] him but he just kicked
[1:54:33] themed walking another
[1:54:39] please and then he found this
[1:54:42] one he said you why are you here say I
[1:54:46] don't have anyone to help me for 30
[1:54:48] years
[1:54:50] he said you want to help
[1:54:54] you you don't need to fall in the
[1:54:58] water I am here because I chose
[1:55:02] you rise up take up your
[1:55:06] bed and
[1:55:11] walk says what an
[1:55:16] opportunity to give you that opportunity
[1:55:18] and he called you
[1:55:21] and elected you to be his
[1:55:24] servant what could be more precious
[1:55:29] than without you having a
[1:55:31] choice it would be totally impossible
[1:55:34] for any man to seek
[1:55:39] God if you have something in your heart
[1:55:41] that loves God and seeks after God it
[1:55:44] means God chose
[1:55:48] you
[1:55:53] even when you
[1:55:55] sin you are guilt in your
[1:55:59] heart because you are not supposed to do
[1:56:02] that for he is by nature a sinner
[1:56:07] man and he has nothing within him to
[1:56:10] desire to give a a desire to serve
[1:56:16] God could you go to the pig and tell him
[1:56:19] he is wrong
[1:56:22] he's a pig by
[1:56:24] Nature could you tell him is that is
[1:56:30] wrong by Nature he's a
[1:56:34] pig you should tell him he would be a
[1:56:36] lamb but he is as satisfied as a
[1:56:40] pig you can tell him that he should be a
[1:56:42] lamb but satisfied
[1:56:47] as and I'm I'm happy that I'm not
[1:56:49] satisfied as a
[1:56:53] sinner if you are joking with what I'm
[1:56:58] saying you try it if you have not tried
[1:57:00] it
[1:57:01] before go in the world you will do
[1:57:04] everything they
[1:57:06] do you'll be happy when they
[1:57:08] happy they will be
[1:57:10] satisfied they will be
[1:57:13] satisfied but you will
[1:57:18] not
[1:57:21] brother Victor told
[1:57:23] me you would go there in the
[1:57:26] discs dance and
[1:57:30] dance but something would just come to
[1:57:33] him so what are you
[1:57:36] doing and then his friends will be like
[1:57:38] what's wrong with you come
[1:57:39] on but what was that it was because he
[1:57:43] was not
[1:57:45] satisfied and a sinner is satisfied as a
[1:57:48] sinner
[1:57:50] because his nature is a
[1:57:52] sinner and he says and here it
[1:57:55] is we are all Bor in
[1:57:59] sin shed in
[1:58:02] iniquity come to the world
[1:58:05] speaking by
[1:58:07] Nature a child of
[1:58:09] Disobedience without god without a hope
[1:58:14] the wrath of God abiding on
[1:58:16] us and by The Loving Grace of Christ
[1:58:22] in his Sovereign
[1:58:26] Grace and his
[1:58:31] omnipotence he knocks at your
[1:58:36] heart and he gives the Blessed
[1:58:42] opportunity and turned you
[1:58:47] around and sent you up up the
[1:58:53] road how could you turn that
[1:58:59] down changes your whole
[1:59:04] desire turns you
[1:59:06] around and starts you the other
[1:59:12] way and you will be silly to the
[1:59:15] world and you will all you will be Sil
[1:59:18] to the world
[1:59:20] but you will be blessed in the sight of
[1:59:24] God blessed are they that do hung and
[1:59:27] thirst for
[1:59:30] righteousness they shall be
[1:59:33] filled notice it was God it this is what
[1:59:36] God
[1:59:39] did what God
[1:59:41] called you had no will to
[1:59:47] call you could have no desire to
[1:59:52] call because your nature was completely
[1:59:54] contrary to
[1:59:57] it but in conclusion here he says but
[2:00:01] God by
[2:00:04] election he called you and he turned you
[2:00:08] around and set your
[2:00:12] affections towards Christ and the things
[2:00:16] above how could we turn that down
[2:00:21] then God showed in
[2:00:24] Abraham what we would what he would do
[2:00:26] for
[2:00:29] all for
[2:00:32] all that are
[2:00:34] called Not only was was this blessed
[2:00:37] promise of the resurrection and eternal
[2:00:39] life given to
[2:00:46] Abraham but to his SE after him
[2:00:53] they
[2:00:55] called the elected
[2:00:59] of I'm glad today I can say I'm the
[2:01:04] call and our Prophet spoke all those
[2:01:07] things in the message the
[2:01:12] communion so in other words why do we
[2:01:15] take the
[2:01:17] communion because we part of him
[2:01:21] inow Hallelujah am and we are designing
[2:01:24] the Lord's
[2:01:25] [Music]

[2:01:33] to

[2:01:41] Slowly are you not so glad because of
[2:01:43] his election amen
[2:01:48] hallelujah
[2:02:05] praise the
[2:02:07] Lord
[2:02:17] hallelujah
[2:02:19] isn't he
[2:02:24] wonderful in that message a prophet says
[2:02:28] many of the churches have has closed
[2:02:30] communion that is just to their own
[2:02:32] church when they have their communion
[2:02:35] but here we are not a denomination we
[2:02:38] have open communion for all for we
[2:02:41] believe that every believer has a right
[2:02:43] to take the table of the Lord and to
[2:02:45] Fellowship around the good things of God
[2:02:48] with every believer regardless of greed
[2:02:50] color or whatever he may be that all
[2:02:54] have been made to drink of the self same
[2:02:58] blessing and that is Jesus
[2:03:03] Christ
[2:03:06] hallelujah amen are there deons

[2:04:47] 23
[2:04:55] for I have received of the Lord that
[2:04:58] which I also which also I delivered unto
[2:05:02] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[2:05:06] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:05:09] when he had given thanks he broke it and
[2:05:11] said and listen to these words carefully
[2:05:14] he said take it this is my body
[2:05:22] which is broken for you this do in
[2:05:25] remembrance of me and after the same
[2:05:27] manner also he took the cup when he had
[2:05:31] Saed saying this cup is the New
[2:05:33] Testament in my blood this do ye as
[2:05:37] often as ye drink it in remembrance of
[2:05:39] me for as of as ye eat this bread and
[2:05:42] drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[2:05:45] death till he
[2:05:47] come
[2:05:50] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:05:53] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:05:56] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:05:58] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[2:06:01] examine himself and so let him eat of
[2:06:04] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[2:06:07] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[2:06:09] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself

[2:06:15] body for this cause many are weak and a
[2:06:18] sickly among you and many
