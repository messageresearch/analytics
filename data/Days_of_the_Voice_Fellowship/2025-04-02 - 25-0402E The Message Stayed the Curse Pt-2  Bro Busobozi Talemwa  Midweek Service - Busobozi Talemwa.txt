May you let your word have uh your way its way in our [Music] lives. We desire nothing but you are all that matters to us tonight. Bless each person that has been able to come to church physically. and even our brothers and sisters that are joining us by the way of the internet bless all of us together. We desire to hear from you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. He car for you. We car it for you as we open Malachi [Music] 4. adore. He car for you. I do far. I do far. [Music] I to [Music] go [Music] inside. You believe he will speak to you tonight? Sing it now. Carth say for me. Oh he car it for me through sunshine through sunshine. Oh shadow he car for me. We read verses 5-6. Amen. Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and a dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. We have a prayer request here from sister Martha requesting for prayer as she'll be traveling to leader during this weekend for a barrier. So as we pray for the word, let us also pray for Lord Jesus. We are thinking about our brethren that have lost their loved [Music] ones. As we had brother success up in uh in Nebby lost his father, comfort him and the entire family and use this situation to bring him closer to you. And Lord, we also remember our sister Martha who is going to be traveling for another barrier. Lord, we ask your protection upon her. Father, as you be traveling and in going and in coming back, may your holy angels watch over her, God. And Lord, we want to commit this session of your word. Energize us Lord and use us Lord to speak your word to your people. Not just your vessels Lord. Use us Father. We ask this blessing in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Please be seated. Um as usual I'm going to request those that I can't see or that can't see me to please come and sit this side. uh you know we we this place when we build our church we will not put those pillars in but these pillars usually obstruct especially on Wednesday when we don't have church full so some people like sitting in places where you have to do like this for uh it's always good when you sit where the preacher can Amen. Praise the Lord. Has the Lord been good to you? We had a good service also in last Sunday afternoon. A really good meeting with the saints there. Also, of course, you know that the place where we fellowship there is a at a school. So we we the believers gather there on Thursday evening and also on Sunday uh we we go there every evening. So it is usually after school hours we gather in their main hall. So the students usually join both those services and uh brother Julius actually told me the other day that I think about two students how many wanted to be baptized. Yeah. Few students uh are already ready for baptism. So the Lord is already doing something. So we um we we had a good service and afterwards we went to um um uh the brother's house is you know they were here we introduced them to you brother Emma and his wife sister Sarah and um because they had gone to a new house they wanted us to come and pray there and so We we really had a good time also other believers came and joined us. So we we had a good fellowship and a good swall as well. Sorry you missed that but uh it was a good time in then afterwards we traveled. So I was really dead in the evening. So the whole of Monday I was also just crawling. I was very tired. But I figure we have to serve God when we are still young and strong. As you grow, you realize that the body gets tired quicker. But by God's grace as he gives us grace, strength in a body, we are yet to serve him more for more years. 30 more years, 40 more years, we'll preach this message. If the Lord tries, we are preach. So the devil should get ready. We are still here. If the Lord tries, we will we are going to preach more years. And uh you know uh as you know I travel a lot. So when I'm here I want to give you as much as I can and when I travel then the other brothers can be able to also minister. Yeah. Sometimes um I I have things on my heart that I really feel that the church should you know we should share with the church. Uh but don't make a mistake. I always love also to sit down and be ministered to. There are some preachers who don't like to be preached too. So but me I love it. I just I believe every preacher needs to be preached to. And whenever you hear others preach, you you you are revived. I was revived on uh on on Friday night. Brother Julius and brother preached good. Those who did not come on Friday, you missed brother Pol's sermon. It was quite an amazing amazing message. Praise the Lord. So this evening, I just want to continue with what we shared on Sunday. Maybe taking a few corners there and here and there. Uh the message stayed the curse. The message stayed the curse. Aina. Amen. So that I take it from uh vers six which in verse one verse five he says behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and the dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers of the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. If you notice in the book of Malachi chapter 3, he's speaking about another messenger. And please put on your spiritual thinking caps because this you need to understand these things. In verses one of chapter 3, he says, "Behold, I'll send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me. And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he shall come, sayith the Lord of hosts. So you see those words mean different things. So when he says, I will send. Who is speaking? God is speaking. My messenger, which messenger? This is the messenger who was going to come before the Lord comes to the [Music] earth before the first coming of Jesus. And then he says he shall prepare the way before me. So this messenger was supposed to prepare the way before the Lord is coming. And then the Lord whom you seek of course here is speaking to the Jews. They were they were already worshiping God for many years. in the temple with the temple. But then here he says the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come into his temple. But you see here he is speaking about John the Baptist coming to prepare the way before the coming the first coming of Jesus. And when John the Baptist comes, then the Lord will come in his name. So who is the Lord? The God of the Old Testament, the Jehovah of the Old Testament. He says, "I am the Lord. That is my name and my I will not give my praise to any graven image or my glory." So he cannot share his lordship with anyone. There is only one Lord, one faith and one baptism here. O Israel, the Lord, your God is one Lord. So you see is one God. There are not two or three gods. There is only one God. The creator of heaven and earth. Now the creator of heaven and earth was going to come in a body of flesh. He created a temple so that he may come in the temple. And he even gave a prophecy by the lips of Malachi that the Lord is coming in his temple. But they did not understand because they thought he was talking about the temple of Solomon. But they did not understand. He was talking about his own body. The body he had created. He was talking about Jesus. Jesus is the temple and God is a spirit. So God the spirit came in Jesus the body. And so Jesus was the temple of God. and and and you know the God they were waiting for was now walking in Jesus on earth. And when they saw Jesus, they refused to believe him because they refused to believe John, they did not understand when God came in Jesus. And because they refused to believe in Jesus, they were cast. [Music] He they looked at him and they said, "Oh, who are you?" They said, "You are just a son of Mary, son of Joseph. You were even born out of wedlock." illegitimate child. They thought he was, but they never understood this is the creator of heaven and earth. He has come down on earth. The Bible says he came among his own, but his own received him not. He was the light that shines in the world. But when Amen. when he came to shine in the world, they love the darkness more than the light. are the they the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the ones that had spent a long time rehearsing the scriptures of the law. They had spent a long time talking about, you know, God and about Jesus coming. They believed in the Messiah. By the way, they believed in the Messiah. They would read scriptures like in Isaiah, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, the government shall be upon his shoulders." They read the scriptures. They read scriptures about, you know, a virgin shall conceive and have a son. They read these scriptures. They knew and they rehearsed it over and over. But when Jesus came to them, they rejected him like devils and they said, "Who do you think you are? You you are you have a demon in you." Because the way you are talking, you look like you have demons. If people who kept the law, people who told the law that Jesus was demonp possessed, It means he must have been so controversial to them. They believed in the coming of the Messiah but they never believed in this Messiah. So their messiah they had in their head they had in their theology was different from the Messiah of the prophecy. And today they still reject the Messiah. They still reject the Jesus. The Jesus the denominations worship is different from the Jesus of the Bible. And I can prove that because they rejected Elijah the prophet because they reject the the one that would reveal him, the one that prepares the way before him. They cannot understand him when he come. You cannot understand Jesus. You cannot believe Jesus if you fail to believe the messenger who has been sent to prepare the way before him because they never understood John. When they saw John, they said, "What's wrong with you? They didn't understand. You know, John was a son of a priest. These things are so interesting. Go God is a very good movie actor. He he he sets scenes that are very interesting. See here that he he prepared a priest. A priest who actually never believed in him. What was his name again? Zechariah. Zakaria. You're good Bible readers. And Zakar Zakarias when the angel came to him and brought the news. You have a special child. You're going to give birth. What are you talking about? I'm very busy with my work and you study. Which work was he doing that you were serving God? Don't be busy. Don't be so busy to serve God until you fail to see God when he comes to you. Whenever we go to the mission fields and we are preaching the gospel, many preachers tell us, "Why are you preaching to me? Preach to the sinners on the streets." Oh, let me tell you brethren, we are going to preach and we are preaching to the sinners on the streets. But the end time message which we have is even not for only the sinners on the streets. This is for preachers on the pulpit. This is for church goers, church members, those who think they believe in Jesus. This is where this level of this message is. The message is like university. They are like as if they are in primary section. So we have to upgrade them. God in every generation has been upgrading his people. He says let us leave the foundations of baptisms and faith and these things and let us go on to perfection. The message is not a foundation. The message is a climaxing of the whole thing. The message is the climax of the entire body of Christ. Let me put it this way. We are not the alpha bride. We are the omega bride. We are not the alpha church. We are the omega church. So we we are not right here at the beginning. We are at the end. That's why it is called an end time message. So now we need to understand the message which we have cannot be understood by those who despise the messenger that God has sent. [Music] And if you think we are the same like Miracle Center, you are lost because you see we sing the songs that Felero sings and you think we are the same. You don't know what you're talking about. This message is more than any other denomination. It is the highest revelation in this hour. That's why we cannot be among them. This message is come out from among them. Be ye separate. So this message is a calling out. Amen. We are right in this exodus in the third exodus where we are being called out of the denomination. Come out from my people and we have come out. And so here Zakarius as he was busy he never understood what God was doing. And so what happened? He was cast. This message we are dealing with is a serious message. Any man who refuses it will be cast. You know Jesus said when you go to a town and you are refused shake off your the dust off your feet meaning cast them. Yes sir. Who had the authority to do that? Only the man who had that say the Lord. Only he that was sent. Not everyone was sent. Others are preaching because they are believing the one who was sent. But I'm talking about the one who was saved. The apostles were the ones with the right to do that because they were sent. Paul was the messenger of the first age. He could do that because he was sent. He was sent to the Gentiles. He was the messenger of the first church age. So he could cast those who refused to believe his message. And now we see in the same same way that when he the angel came down with a message that my messenger is coming Zakaria refused to believe he was dumbfounded. No you will no longer talk. Meaning anyone who doesn't believe this message he has no right to talk. Amen. You have no right to listen to them. Come out from among them. These messages are coming out and are going into the rapture. And then we see later on you know the angel went to the woman Elizabeth. This was a priest but he failed to understand. The religious people are the most confused. But God always reveals himself to the humble such as can learn. Are you humble enough to learn? Are you willing to learn? Amen. And and and and you know when when John the Baptist was born, you know, after a little while, he went to the wild, he became a wild man. And everybody was speaking perhaps that you see this uh the the priest's boy went to the wild. He he got spoiled. Maybe he's taking weed. Who knows? Because by the time he came out of the wild, he was looking with all the dreadlocks. Don't use dreadlocks because John had dreadlocks. You are not John. Yes, you are. You have to understand God will do what he wants to do when he wants to do it. Hallelujah. Amen. That a believer must know. And so we see he came out with dreadlocks, you know, with all the the teared clothes. And then he began, you know, he was eating wild honey. a locust. And by the time he came out, he he came out, you know, uh with maybe red eyes, who knows? Repent. This was a message like has never been heard before. But you know, it was not a message from nowhere. It was by for people who knew the prophecies and who had spiritual eyes to discern what God was saying understood who John was. And when he said repent, he repent you people. People believed. Of course, some believe. Not everyone believed. We see in Acts chapter 12, Acts chapter 19. some people about 12 of them who had believed and were following John. And there were several others who believed. The Bible says John had disciples. So they believed. Amen. There will be believers in every age. And the believers their eyes will be open. The believers they will be blessed. The believers they will be under a special anointing of the season. But there was another group. This was the biggest group. They had the biggest churches. They had the best music. They had better preachers. They had better clothes. They were called Pharisees and when they came to John, they never believed John asked him questions to trap him. But John was anointed. John knew the scriptures. Amen. If you are true servant of God, you will always know the scriptures and fulfill them. Amen. But only God knows how to package his servants in such a way that he will always offend those who are not meant to believe. That's why in in the message of the hour, brother says many things. Some of them you can even stumble on them. But you know, God allowed him to say that way to shake off the unbelievers. And then he says, I predict, I do not prophesy, but I predict 1977 will bring the end of world systems. And then now people will begin to say, "Ah, he prophesied the end of the world." So for us, we don't believe him. He's a false prophet. Don't you worry. That was for you to shake you off. There are many other things he's saying. said, "A woman who has allowed herself to be used by the devil going into immorality and they have made her a sex garbage can." And now when you hear such a thing and that's what Hollywood has done, that's what the systems of the world have done to a woman. They have made a lustful object with all these evil videos and things. You know what? When you hear such phrases, they get offended. They say he's abusing a woman and they walk away. But for you, sister and brother, you will say that is nothing but the truth. They are offended and they call it heresy. But the way that is called heresy, worshipy the God of my father. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. And so that is the message. And so John came and they asked him religious people. They said let us go and prove to him he is nothing. They say they asked him a question. Are you that prophet? He said no. Okay. Are you Elijah? He said no. We thought we would trap him. So who are you? He said, "Praise the Lord." And then he began quoting the prophecy like a typewriter. Listen, John maybe had never read that prophecy. He never went to their schools. He never read the scrolls. He was in the bush. But he quoted it word for word. I am the voice of him crying from the wilderness. Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Make his path straight. And they got confused. But that's prophecy. That's scripture. That's whatever. That's whatever. But what John had said that said he could not take back did they believe him? No. They didn't believe him. And when the Messiah came, the same people who refused to believe John, their eyes were closed to who the Messiah was. when they refused to believe the [Music] message who had come to prepare the coming of the Lord. They were cast. They could no longer see the Lord. Their eyes were blinded and the Lord came. The Lord of glory. The one who created heaven and earth. The one who gave the law. He came and stood before them and they told him, "You above the book and then they will go back and they read and ask a son is given such blindness and they come back to him. You are blinded. They were cast because they refused to believe the messenger. Okay, let me come to today. If they don't believe the messenger, they can never see Jesus. Jesus is the word. They claim to believe Jesus. They claim to have Jesus, claim to sing for Jesus. No, they don't. They don't know him. Even the one they are singing about is not the one that actually is. That's why some of the songs they sing, we grab it from them because we are the right people supposed to sing. They can't understand what they're talking about. Hallelujah. Redeemed. How I love to proclaim. Who are you? Are you redeemed in your anglicism and Catholicism? No, you are not. But who is redeemed? He that has received the present truth, the word. So we take those songs and we begin singing them. And when we sing them, the anointing comes upon us and breaks the yoke. Why? Because it's not about the song. is about the singer of the song. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The message stay the cast. It's only the messenger's message which can stay the cast. Elijah's ministry is not a simple ministry. If you believe it, believe it. If you don't, leave it. And even if you're planning to walk away from the message, walk away silently. Don't talk anything evil because if you do, I'm telling you, you are in danger. This message is a powerp packed message. It is a message packed with blessings and backed with curses. Yes sir. The Bible in the book of Malachi said, "I'll send my messenger Elijah the prophet before the great and the dreadful of the Lord." The great day of the Lord was the first coming of Jesus and John was the messenger. The dreadful day of the Lord has not yet happened. It is the second coming of Jesus. And we are waiting for it. But the Bible here is saying before the coming of the great day and before the coming of the dreadful day, I will send Elijah the prophet. And what shall he do before the great day? Before the first coming of Jesus, he will turn the heart of the fathers to the children. the fathers, the fathers of the law, the the Old Testament people, the Pharisees, their hearts, we are turn to grace that is fathers to children. But you see, there's another portion which was never fulfilled. This is for our time and the heart of the children to the fathers. Amen. Amen. We are the children of God. We are received the spirit of God. So we are the children of this generation. But you see the hearts of the children in many denominations in the end time they are lost in wrong doctrine. So Elijah the prophet must come and when he comes his message will turn their hearts to the Pentecostal fathers. Amen. And so now we are the children. Our hearts must be turned back to the faith of the fathers, back to the favor of the faith of the apostles, back to the original faith, back to the Bible. You see this Elijah ministry is not bringing anything new. It is bringing that which was there already. [Music] Elijah is come. Tell your neighbor Elijah is come. Our hearts have been turned. Amen. All right. Give me that picture, brother. If you have brother Isaac will, if you can put up that picture, that yellow picture, that' be wonderful. Do we have it over here, brother Marvin? I know I did not give you a warning, but I told you to make it ready. if you don't have it or just leave it and continue. Praise the name of the Lord. And so we look over here in the book of Colossians chapter one vers uh six as the brother is putting up the picture uh 6. And before we read that You can see here on this picture, Elijah comes five times the first coming of Elijah. First Kings 17:1, Elijah the one who caught fire from heaven. That was the first man called Elijah. But God uses the spirit which was upon him four more times. And we see it comes upon a man called Elisha. Second Kings 2:1, he replicated the ministry of Elijah in a double portion. God now in Malachi 4 at the end of the Old Testament, he pro he promises to use the spirit of Elijah again. But if we say, listen carefully, if we say that this Elijah will not come to the Gentiles, but only to the Jews, we do not believe in the grace of God. We do not believe in the power and the work of the cross because the Messiah was not ours. He didn't come to us. But by grace, by election, by for the Messiah came to the Gentiles. So because of that, this prophecy in Malachi 4 has a double effect to it, it speaks about John. But in that last part, it speaks about an Elijah coming to the Gentiles before the second coming of Jesus. But also he is speaking about the Elijah who is coming to the Jews after the rapture. The Bible in the book of revelation also speaks about them in revelation 3 11 rather he speaks about the two witnesses that's the fifth coming of the spirit of Elijah. So that is coming too. But we don't want to talk about that because that is after the rapture. We don't want to talk about this because John already came. But we want to see after the first coming of Jesus, there must be another coming of Jesus, the rapture. just before he comes again, the Elijah ministry must come back again. And if you read in the book of Luke chapter 17, the Bible right there speaks about the ministry of Elijah again. And he says Elijah when when they asked Jesus, listen carefully, they asked Jesus, why did the writers say Elias must first come? Jesus answered it and said, Elijah truly shall first come and do what? and restore all things. John the Baptist never restored anything. John the Baptist prepared for something new to come. So now we see there was an Elijah that listen that Jesus spoke about in future tense when he said Elias truly shall shall first come. This is this Jesus speaking. He's saying Elias first come but yet this one had already come John. Are you getting it now? So in other words, Jesus in that part of the scripture was speaking about the future coming of Elijah after his first coming. And he said that one shall restore her. But John never restored. He prepared. So the one who was coming before the second coming of Jesus which is this one which is William brother. His work was to restore all things. Amen. Are you following me church? So now we see he continues on in the book of uh the same book and he says but I say unto you Elijah has come already. So Jesus said Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things. And then he says but I say unto you Elijah has come already. Ah, he was talking about Elijah coming before his first coming and Elijah coming after his. Are you following me? Now Jesus knew the scripture like as if of course he is God. He wrote it. If John the prophet knew the scripture, how about Jesus himself? That's why when Jesus was quoting the prophecy of Isaiah 61, we don't have time to go there. In Isaiah 61, God was speaking to through the lips of Isaiah, speaking about the coming of the Messiah. Are you following me? And you know what he said? The spirit of the Lord God is upon me. He has anointed me to to set free the captives to open the prison doors there. Open the eyes of the blind. Follow closely now. And then when he went to verse two, he said, "And to declare the acceptable year of the Lord, and to comfort all them that mourn." Verse two, was speaking about the dreadful day of the Lord. Are you following me? He was talking about the bread of God. Verse one of Isaiah 61. Just go and start the he was then speaking about the the day the exac acceptable year the year of freedom when God will come in flesh and die for human race. It is a great day. That was the great day of the Lord. Now when Jesus came on earth in the book of Luke chapter 4, he actually quoted that same Isaiah 61. And he said, "The spirit of the Lord God is upon. He has anointed me." And he read the whole verse one. And when it reached on verse two, he he stopped. He cut it in the middle and he closed the book. Everybody looked at him. He left out the other part which was saying to declare the to to declare the day of vengeance of our God. He left it out. It's the part of the dreadful. It's about him. But during his second coming, he never read that part. He read the first part and he closed the book. Everybody looked at him and then he began to say this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. Meaning only the part which I have read that you have heard me read is fulfilled now. Amen. In other words, he was telling them, but there is another part which is to come. Jesus knew how to rightly divide the word of truth because he himself is the truth. So now we see church. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So we see Jesus now was able to say Elijah's coming and he will restore all fear. He will restore all. Are you following me church? Restore all when Elijah comes before the second coming of Jesus Christ. He will restore all and that is the ministry of William after him the rapture goes after the rapture then the Elijah ministry will come again to the 144,000 this ministry is based on the message of this [Music] Elijah. His message is actually preparing people for the second coming of Jesus Christ. If they fail to see his message and his ministry, they will never see Jesus Christ. they will be cast. Why? It's not my words. He said he shall turn the hearts of the fathers of the children and the hand of the children to their fathers lest I come and I strike the earth to the c. Now in other words if Elijah ministry does not come the earth will be smitten with a c But it has come. I am here trumpeting the voice saying Elijah is come and our hearts have been turned. Hallelujah. Our hearts have been turned. Is your heart turned brother? Is your heart turned sister? Our hearts have been turned. Therefore we cannot be cast. We are the right people to read the scripture in Romans. And I say there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. We have been restored. We have been redeemed. We have Oh, hallelujah. Amen. We have been revived. We are right here in the bride's revival. Why? We have received Elijah's message. But those who turn away and they walk away and they refuse it, they are under a curse. And I can prove that to you. When God sent a messenger in every age, you know those who refuse to believe it, they were automatically cast. When Jesus came and the Pharisees refused to believe him, do you remember what he said? He said because you have refused to believe me, you are already condemned. They are not going to be judged in the future. We already judge and judgment is equals to C. Amen. Galatians 1 6. I marvel. This is Apostle Paul. Now, a man who had a message into the first church 8. I marvel that he has soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel. which is not another. But there be some that trouble you and I would provide the gospel of Christ. But then here now Paul begins to talk about the gospel of Christ. Listen church, the gospel of Christ is not words of a man. The gospel of Christ is not theological terms. The gospel of Christ, the gospel of Christ is the message of the hour that God gives to the man of the hour. That is the gospel of Christ. And it will always agree with the Bible 100%. We have many preachers today, tens of thousands of them. But let me tell you, let me tell you, our work is to re-echo the gospel. I do not have a message of my own. I have no private revelation. I am taking my message from the messenger. There was one star in every generation. And that star shine to the old generation. So God takes other men from the five-fold ministry. He anoints them to preach not another message to preach the same message. And when you know William Brandham started his ministry, he said I preach what Paul preached. He did not quote word for word. Then there are some of them who say well we have to read word for word and we say amen and go home. You know brother preached the message here. So let us now hear the word of God and you begin reading word for word and others are saying we shouldn't even read in our voice. We should put his voice, brother Banam's voice to preach to us. That's good by the way. We can do it. We have done it before here. But then the problem is when they say that's the only thing that can be done. They say pastor keep quiet. The word of God came on to brother. Let him preach. And then they go to church. They put on tapes only. They don't accept preachers to preach. I believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, today and forever. If he use brother Brham, he will use. If he use a big person, he will use a small person. He's the same same God. [Music] But you see there are some who have preached another gospel. He has said it's not another message we love in the same tapes we love to hear have perverted it and they want us to follow after a Catholic spirit. They want to remove the spirit from the church whereby you tell us one man will tell us what to hear the whole world that's a Catholic spirit I came from there I can no longer be bound again I have been liberated but here is what I believe each of us should listen to those steps each of us should feast on that food. It is a food for the bride. Amen. Each of us should read the Bible. Amen. But where we say because the Bible is is the only inspired message. We should come here in church and play the Bible and then we go back the book of Matthew and then it reads the book of the generations of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham and then after we hear everything go home. Amen. Is that apostolic? We believe in reading the book as individuals, but we also believe in anointed men of God coming down at the pull pit quoting from the same book and preaching to you a sermon that will change your [Applause] life. Can you shout amen to that? Amen. Amen. We love this message and this message stay the curse. And Apostle Paul the first messenger, he said, "But though we an angel come from heaven preach any other gospel, preach any other gospel. Let him be a cast. Let him be a cast. Whato? Paul, are you cursing people? Yes. Actually, Paul c people and even if he did not say it, they were already cast by preaching another gospel by believing another doctrine. Paul preached Jesus as the only lord god. Paul preached one god. Paul preached water baptism in the name of our lord Jesus Christ in much water. Paul say no women preachers. Paul preached the order in the church. Tong to edify the church not to confuse but to edify. He says if all of you speak in tongues at the same time you will be confused and even if someone comes in you he will say you're mad crazy but then he says one should speak another inter and one speak another interpret maximum in a church service three one speak in a church service these things are here in the Bible but the denominations they rejected that They said for us we believe in something else. You hear preachers on the microphone. Everybody pray in task. And that's why Amen. We have heard this message say come out of her my people be not partakers of a sin of her curse. Amen. Amen. where you go to church and looks like you have gone to a bar dance party or something. I love what I see and then you see they're calling themselves Christians. Even a a worldly person knows better. First of all, the way they dress does not portray their Christianity. I believe as the Bible teaches us, as Paul taught us, a Christian must dress in modest clothing. There's even preachers. You find you see the trousers they wearing, men, sometimes old men, sometimes with gray hair. And you find he he's dressing like a trouser whereby he looks like he's powered inside. He's walking but he's like a woman. Shame on on our generation. You see that's why the message has stayed the curse. Our safety is in the message of the hour. We should love the message because it is only the thing that God has used in our generation to take us back to the true Bible teachings. We are the true Jesus people. We are the true Bible believers. And we are not alone. There are many like us all over the world. Amen. Amen. You have seen them. We have had them in our meetings here. You've seen them from Switzerland, from France, from America, from Australia, from Ethiopia, right here in this church. They have come and preached to you. They've come and told you the same things I tell you. They've come from Zimbabwe. They've come from South Africa. They've come from all over and God has a bride. Amen. In every country on earth, we don't go to Bible college. But when we begin preaching, we say the same thing because we are under the same anointing. We believe the same message. We have accepted the same prophet and he has led us to the same same Bible. My my my my hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Oh, glory to God. Amen. In Exodus 12, as I'm approaching to finish now. Amen. Moses was another prophet that God used in his time. And Moses had a message. And Mo then Moses called for all the elders of Israel. And he said unto them, "Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover. And he shall take a bunch of his and dip it in the blood that is in the in the bin. And strike the lint and the two side posts with the blood that is in the Benson. And none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. What did you hear? The message. Oh my my my God had his people in Gosh. They were the minority, but they had the truth. We might be the minority, but we have the truth. We are not looking for big crowds. If we have them, praise the Lord. But that's not what we this message is purposed for. You see, when message when Moses was bringing his message, he didn't care how many were there. He cared about the souls that were supposed to be redeemed. and none of you. He gave them the message how they should take and eat the lambs and strike the blood on the on the dopest. For the Lord will pass through the to smite the Egyptians. For the Lord will come through to bring the curse. And when he sh when he seeth the blood upon the lint and on the two side ports. The Lord will pass over the door, and he will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you, and he shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever. Amen. And you know what? people who do not even if they were Jews, if they didn't take this message serious, they died. There was death in their house. The angel of death, the curse knew one thing, the blood. On Sunday, I spoke about the bleeding water. You see the bleeding word is the message in every generation. When God sends a prophet and he gives him a message that is the bleeding word. Now here we see in Egypt there was a prophet with a message that was the bleeding message. It was a message of blood. And whosoever would hear that prophet they applied the token. They applied the blood and when the angel of death came when the curse came it passed over them and went to another house. Is there blood the message of blood? No. Then it came in struck the firstborn and there was death in the even died. God is not respectful of persons. If you are out of the message, you are under a curse. God won't respect you because you are old or young or or have money or or or whatever. It doesn't matter. The curse will come upon. Paul said all day even if it is an angel from heaven if he doesn't believe this let him be cast. So this is not a negotiation, brethren. I'm not preaching these things for you to fear. I'm preaching these things to you so you can apply the blood. So you can rejoice and say, "Thank God for the message. Thank God for the prophet of Malachi 4. Thank God for the Elijah ministry. By this we have been saved from the curse. The message has stayed a curse off of us. We'll continue from there. God bless you. You may stand on your feet. Ah man. Thank you Jesus. Amen. Give the Lord a clap of praise everybody. Thank him for his grace. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's the master of the wind. Amen. Brother, can you come up and help me? Let us sing that song. Thank you, Jesus. Well, my board of life sails on a troubled sea. Ever there's a wind in my s. But my heavenly father, he watches over me when the breeze turns into a gay.

Hallelujah. I don't know which key. I think just just follow us. Amen. And as the deacons perhaps bring the bags and we can also give the offerings as we sing this song. Christ our redeemer. Christ our redeemer died on the cross. Die for the sinner paid all his due. Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the lamb and I will pass. I will pass over you. Come on now sing it everybody.
