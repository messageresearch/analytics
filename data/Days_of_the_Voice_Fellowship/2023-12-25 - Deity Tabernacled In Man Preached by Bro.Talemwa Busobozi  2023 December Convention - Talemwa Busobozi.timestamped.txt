[5:40] amen
[5:41] hallelujah praise the name of the
[5:44] Lord amen may be S just a
[5:48] moment
[5:52] amen there is uh I'd like to greet you
[5:56] all in the precious name of our Lord
[5:58] Jesus I am so happy to be here with
[6:02] you during these
[6:05] meetings this has been uh I don't lose
[6:08] track on the number but I think it's uh
[6:10] like the fourth or fifth
[6:14] time every year we've been
[6:16] here and I want to appreciate Pastor B
[6:19] for the
[6:22] invitation confidence he has placed in
[6:24] our
[6:28] ministry is an encouragement for us when
[6:33] we we are always
[6:36] encouraged to continue serving the lord
[6:39] when we come and find people who are
[6:43] dedicated from other churches and other
[6:47] places really that's one of the purposes
[6:49] of a
[6:51] convention because when you come you
[6:53] find other
[6:56] believers likeminded
[6:58] faith and you know from different
[7:01] churches isn't it
[7:03] amazing to know that we can truly come
[7:07] into a true
[7:11] Unity true Unity is that which only
[7:14] comes by the by the word of
[7:18] God and we have the same
[7:21] Spirit we have a what we call a kindred
[7:26] spirit and you see we are not the only
[7:28] ones
[7:30] there are others like us all over the
[7:34] world and if we were to meet in a an
[7:37] auditorium all of us all over the
[7:42] world we would sing the same
[7:45] songs we we would speak the same
[7:48] language we would love each other the
[7:51] same
[7:53] way and we would believe the same
[7:56] word we we would believe that God you
[7:59] know the same
[8:01] Prophet the same
[8:03] message and above all we would have one
[8:08] bishop and that is Jesus
[8:10] Christ hallelujah praise God and we are
[8:15] the only group of people all over the
[8:18] world that cannot be
[8:22] numbered because no one has the right
[8:27] statistics like who who really does
[8:31] governments don't know how many we
[8:34] are we ourselves don't know how many we
[8:37] are all that we know is that we are one
[8:41] of
[8:44] them praise God it is a wonderful
[8:48] feeling to be a part of the Bride of our
[8:51] Lord Jesus
[8:53] Christ and to see men of God that have
[8:55] served God I mean Pastor told me

[28:27] to pass as the Angels were gone away
[28:30] from them into heaven the shepherd said
[28:32] one to another let us now go even unto
[28:35] Bethlehem and see this thing which is
[28:37] come to pass which the Lord has made
[28:40] known unto us and they came with haste
[28:44] and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe
[28:46] lying in a manger and when they had seen
[28:49] it they made known they made know abroad
[28:52] a saying which was told them concerning
[28:54] this child and all they had
[28:58] and all they that heard it wondered at
[29:01] those things which were told them by the
[29:03] Shepherds but Mary kept all these things
[29:06] and pondered them in her heart and the
[29:10] the Shepherds returned glorifying and
[29:12] praising God glorifying I love that part

[31:24] amen amen you may be seated
[31:32] I'd like to uh bring greetings from our
[31:35] church in campala days of the voice
[31:40] Fellowship the Saints there sent their
[31:44] greetings and number 12 is not a bad
[31:48] representation WE 12 years from
[31:54] there am
[32:02] amen how many happy to be in the house
[32:03] of the Lord this
[32:06] morning amen as I was meditating last
[32:09] night about the birth of
[32:14] Jesus the world has um you know the
[32:17] world has um
[32:21] masses uh instead of uh a service like
[32:24] we
[32:26] have
[32:33] in commemoration of his
[32:35] birth we are so happy that we are not
[32:38] only thinking about the Messiah that was
[32:39] born 2,000 years
[32:45] ago we want to see him born in our
[32:48] hearts this
[32:50] morning and so as I was meditating last
[32:54] night I heard those words
[32:57] and you know it just echoed in my
[33:03] ears Tabernacle in
[33:12] man
[33:15] Tabernacle in man and so I wondered how
[33:18] that is connected to the birth of
[33:23] Jesus and so started to pray and study
[33:25] over it and so I want to show you a few
[33:28] things that God revealed to me and I
[33:29] trust it will be a blessing to
[33:33] you if God gave it to me I believe it is
[33:37] for someone here this
[33:40] morning do you have a need that that you
[33:43] brought before the
[33:44] Lord how many prayed last
[33:47] night so God is going to answer your
[33:50] need so if you are
[33:52] expecting I believe you're going to
[33:55] receive tell your neighbor you going to
[33:59] receive now I want to show you that it
[34:01] all started in
[34:03] heaven all started in heaven and then
[34:07] from Heaven came down into the garden
[34:10] of the devil
[34:13] thought he would defeat
[34:15] God you know as the Bible says in the
[34:18] Book of
[34:20] Revelation it says there was war In
[34:24] Heaven There was war in heaven
[34:28] Michael
[34:29] fought against the
[34:32] dragon with his fallen
[34:36] angels and Michael also
[34:38] fought with his angels and Michael was
[34:42] representing
[34:44] God and I don't even know how the devil
[34:47] was
[34:49] thinking to think that he can defeat the
[34:52] the
[34:53] war he can defeat God in his
[34:58] presence he is doing the same mistake
[35:02] today to think that he can defeat the
[35:04] children of
[35:06] God in the presence of God it is not
[35:10] possible for Satan to
[35:13] defeat the armies of the Living
[35:16] God because the Bible says God is the
[35:20] Lord of
[35:22] hosts he is mighty in
[35:25] battle he is not
[35:27] weak the god of love he's the god of
[35:31] love but he does not mean he he loves
[35:34] only and he does not make
[35:40] war oh no he he loves but he also is a
[35:45] god of
[35:46] war and when he makes
[35:49] War he always stands out to be the
[35:52] mighty
[35:54] conqueror you know when a country
[35:56] declares War another
[35:58] country you do not know who will
[36:01] win but when God declares
[36:04] war you 100%
[36:07] sure he's going to win that
[36:10] war because he the Lord of
[36:14] H Mighty in
[36:16] battle and I want to say that is our
[36:20] God and he is when when you when you're
[36:23] going to make
[36:24] war you don't just go and
[36:27] fight you have to have a
[36:31] strategy how you are going to defeat
[36:33] your
[36:33] enemy you have to have a
[36:36] plan and God is a master
[36:43] strategist before even the devil thought
[36:47] it about defeating about fighting and
[36:50] you know taking
[36:53] over before it crossed the mind of Satan
[36:59] at that time he was an
[37:00] angel and his name was
[37:03] Lucifer before Lucifer
[37:06] thought about
[37:09] opposing God had already seen
[37:11] it God had already put a plan in
[37:16] place are you not
[37:18] glad that you serve that kind of
[37:21] God is a master
[37:25] strategist God had seen the
[37:29] end right at the
[37:33] beginning Hallelujah he had seen the
[37:36] end right at the beginning and he had he
[37:40] had it all planned
[37:43] out he had known every
[37:46] move Satan will
[37:48] make and he had known how he will combat
[37:53] it but also the devil had a plan
[37:58] his plan was I will
[38:01] Ascend above the stars of
[38:03] God and I will become God
[38:06] himself that was plan
[38:09] a of
[38:11] Satan but remember because Satan is not
[38:16] God he could not have only one
[38:19] plan he had more than one
[38:22] plan because he was not too
[38:25] sure
[38:27] plan will work
[38:31] out so plan
[38:33] a I will
[38:35] Ascend above the stars of God and I will
[38:38] become God but if that
[38:42] fails he I have plan
[38:45] B I will go
[38:49] down take over the human
[38:53] race that was the devil's plan because
[38:57] thought if I fail here in
[38:59] heaven I canot surely fail on
[39:02] Earth and I know according to the way
[39:05] God
[39:07] works if I if I I fight him
[39:10] here and I fail he will most certainly
[39:13] cast me
[39:14] down but I have a plan when he cast me
[39:18] down I will take over his race on
[39:24] Earth I will take over the human race
[39:28] but if that
[39:29] fails I have plan
[39:32] C I will
[39:35] confuse the whole human
[39:37] race and I will rule over
[39:40] them but if that
[39:42] fails and if I can't do
[39:45] it I will then
[39:47] steal kill and destroy the human
[39:55] r
[39:56] was the mind of
[39:58] Satan plan a plan B plan
[40:02] C Hallelujah Hall that is
[40:05] Satan but let me tell you we must be
[40:07] sorry for
[40:10] him because we serve a God who doesn't
[40:15] need plan A B C
[40:18] D but I say our God has a
[40:22] plan and his plan is plan A
[40:29] and plan a cannot
[40:31] fail the moment God s
[40:34] it and he said it that settles it before
[40:39] it has even come to pass it has already
[40:43] happen in his mind already
[40:47] finished is a finished
[40:50] work God is
[40:52] God
[40:54] hallelujah my this makes me me
[40:57] enthused Genesis 3:15 let us see the
[41:00] plan of
[41:03] God and the Lord God said unto the
[41:06] serpent because thou Hast done this thou
[41:09] cast above all cattle and above every
[41:12] beast of the field and upon thy B shalt
[41:14] thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the
[41:17] days of thy
[41:20] life we are now reading from Genesis
[41:25] 3:15
[41:36] [Music]
[41:45] and I will put a between thee and the
[41:47] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[41:49] it shall Breeze thy head and thou shall
[41:51] breathe his
[41:55] heel
[42:05] now friends I want you to see something
[42:07] here
[42:07] pleas give me your
[42:11] attention see that when the devil came
[42:14] down first of all his plan a
[42:18] failed tell your name but the devil's
[42:20] plan
[42:22] failed oh my the devil must be trembling
[42:25] right now
[42:27] because we are discovering him and by
[42:30] discovering his
[42:31] failures we discovering our
[42:34] Victory and if the devil oh my God if
[42:37] the devil failed in the
[42:38] beginning he will always
[42:42] fail the chances of receiving Victory
[42:45] are almost
[42:50] nonexistent he failed in heaven when his
[42:53] plan a
[42:55] failed come to the Earth as a failed
[42:59] spiritual
[43:03] being so the devil came down to us a
[43:07] failure and he's convincing you that you
[43:10] are a
[43:12] failure you are not the failure he is
[43:15] the failure he fail in the beginning he
[43:19] will fail today he will fail tomorrow he
[43:23] will never
[43:24] win but we have a go
[43:27] and his
[43:28] plan never
[43:31] F and I want to see here when he came
[43:34] down here he now said
[43:36] is he called his generals his
[43:40] demons I don't know who he was leading
[43:42] the strategy and
[43:45] the he called him he
[43:49] said let us execute Plan
[43:53] B let us execute Plan B
[43:57] Plan B is green
[43:59] light green light go Plan B is a goal
[44:03] let us
[44:05] begin and what was Plan
[44:08] B to take over the human
[44:12] race so he came
[44:15] down as he
[44:18] is he found a
[44:21] beast which was looking like a human
[44:24] being almost like a human
[44:28] being almost had a
[44:32] soul but never had a soul but had a
[44:36] place for
[44:38] it the devil saw that
[44:41] Beast Adam was somewhere in the
[44:44] garden the devil's plan
[44:47] was the devil maybe his General came and
[44:50] told
[44:51] him yes sir the plan
[44:54] is you are going to go and
[44:58] incarnate into this Beast it is exactly
[45:02] like Adam
[45:04] almost almost like you
[45:07] enter Then you can
[45:10] attack and defile the womb of
[45:14] Eve that way we can plant our seed in
[45:18] there and then we shall take over the
[45:21] human
[45:22] race ah the devil say that's a good plan
[45:26] he
[45:28] execute so now the devil came in and
[45:32] boom he came into the woman a
[45:35] beast and then came to tempt and
[45:39] seduce
[45:42] woman where was God when all this was
[45:46] going
[45:48] on a
[45:51] plan and God does not
[45:54] rush Hallelujah
[45:57] God does not rush because he knows how
[46:00] it is going to
[46:02] end he was
[46:06] there and he doesn't
[46:08] rush and while the devil was doing all
[46:11] this he was just taking a seat
[46:14] somewhere he was not bothered all the
[46:17] Angels were
[46:19] surprised that God was not
[46:22] bothered but God had a
[46:24] plan his plan work
[46:27] out and his plan need the devil to
[46:32] execute his plan
[46:36] first you have to realize

[51:54] Eden
[51:57] when they saw the devil coming to attack
[51:59] Eve and
[52:01] Adam the angels in heaven must have
[52:03] wanted to go and save the day the angels
[52:05] in heaven must have wanted to go and

[52:28] it is my war I'm going to fight it I'm
[52:32] going to win it Hallelujah sometimes it
[52:35] looks like the devil is
[52:38] winning God let the devil win for a
[52:44] moment but he wasn't
[52:47] winning but
[52:49] brother God has a
[52:52] plan it may look like the devil is
[52:54] winning in your
[52:57] life in some areas of your
[53:00] life listen to me this
[53:04] morning brother told us
[53:07] yesterday how can a gentleman shout and

[53:26] it might seem sometimes that the devil
[53:28] is winning in your

[54:10] plan so therefore I say in the name of
[54:12] the Lord Jesus hold stand still and see
[54:15] the salvation of the
[54:22] Lord when all the angels
[54:26] wanted to go and

[54:39] aen praise the name of the Lord
[54:42] hallelujah he he began to put a type a
[54:48] type of his
[54:51] plan he went and

[55:07] sick the devil must have been
[55:12] laughing you don't know what I've

[55:18] just like someone who has repped your
[55:22] child it's a sad thing isn't it
[55:26] that's what the devil had
[55:27] done and he laughing there with a SC
[55:33] voice you don't know what I've
[55:35] done even if you're
[55:37] dressing you don't know what I've done
[55:40] what I've done I've
[55:42] done there's nothing you can do
[55:44] about God didn't didn't fight with him
[55:47] at that
[55:48] time but God showed what he wanted to
[55:52] do by killing a lamb
[55:55] and the devil
[55:57] laugh what will L
[56:01] do my SE is already the
[56:07] human but God had a
[56:10] plan said it in the
[56:12] beginning he said that the seed of the
[56:16] woman shall bre the head of
[56:20] the
[56:23] the the devil had no
[56:28] idea those were Thunders to the
[56:31] devil it was Thunders
[56:34] to he did
[56:37] understand the seed of the
[56:39] woman shall breathe your
[56:42] head what are you talking
[56:45] about called War
[56:48] cabinet what what does he mean how can a
[56:51] woman have a
[56:53] seed of God thew of God these were
[56:57] captains in heaven before they came down
[56:59] to be Devils before they became Devils
[57:02] they were captains in
[57:05] heaven so they know how God does things
[57:08] but they did not know they did not know
[57:10] all that God
[57:18] does is it possible for a woman to have
[57:22] a
[57:23] seat is it any
[57:28] no so what is going to happen we have no
[57:32] idea is a top
[57:36] secret but the plan of God was to use
[57:40] the seed of the
[57:44] woman why couldn't the devil understand
[57:47] it because it was
[57:51] coded with
[57:53] language and re
[57:56] that the devil can't
[57:59] understand there are some
[58:02] Revelations that cannot fit in the
[58:05] devil's little
[58:11] head there are some
[58:14] Revelations that the devil cannot be
[58:16] able to
[58:18] F he can't go around he can't understand
[58:22] it and one of those
[58:33] reation the devil can't
[58:36] understand the seed of the
[58:39] woman that meant a child born without a
[58:44] biological physical human
[58:51] father the devil can't understand how
[58:55] will it
[58:56] be he was
[58:58] confused he can't understand in his

[1:40:36] wept he was tempted like you and I in
[1:40:40] all areas of life even sexual
[1:40:43] Temptations brother balam

[1:40:52] no the prophet said he was tempted even
[1:40:56] with sexual
[1:41:01] Temptations let that sink in but yet he
[1:41:05] was not
[1:41:09] overcome he died how can God
[1:41:13] die that was a human being like you and
[1:41:18] me but he was God
[1:41:24] was tabernacling right in
[1:41:26] there hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:29] amen my God in the testimony of a true
[1:41:35] witness all right he says oh
[1:41:39] God what is it the Holy Ghost the true
[1:41:43] witness of
[1:41:45] God what is it let me go back again let
[1:41:50] me rewind
[1:41:51] because some people have
[1:41:53] missed the Bible tells us to wait one on
[1:41:56] another so let us rewind he begins by
[1:41:59] saying oh God what is it the Holy Ghost
[1:42:05] the true witness of
[1:42:06] God what is
[1:42:11] itac in
[1:42:15] man have you ever heard
[1:42:17] that those are not my
[1:42:19] words from our
[1:42:21] Prophet what is the holy
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:26] ghost
[1:42:28] in and the prophet says hallelujah
[1:42:32] hallelujah
[1:42:34] what church that is the reason I cannot
[1:42:38] take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of
[1:42:42] crying
[1:42:47] Shing or of speaking in tes or any
[1:42:52] sensation and he says they are all right
[1:42:57] now brother is not saying we should not
[1:43:01] cry should not Shake we should not speak
[1:43:04] in Tong we should not be
[1:43:07] excited right now how many are
[1:43:10] excited it's okay he says that is all
[1:43:15] but he says I cannot take the Holy Ghost
[1:43:18] be only those things
[1:43:21] them things are all
[1:43:22] right but here's the problem the devil
[1:43:25] can impersonate all
[1:43:28] that so
[1:43:30] real so
[1:43:34] real but the Holy Ghost
[1:43:40] is God tacle
[1:43:45] in it is more than a
[1:43:48] sensation it is more than speaking in
[1:43:52] Tong is your Prophet saying
[1:43:54] this is more than shouting in a
[1:43:58] spirit it is more than
[1:44:00] weeping it is more than joining
[1:44:03] Church it is God living in
[1:44:10] man God
[1:44:15] himself in that person Hallelujah when
[1:44:17] he can
[1:44:18] speak it is just the
[1:44:23] as God
[1:44:24] speaking that is the Church of Jesus

[1:44:54] witness not an empty
[1:44:57] shell notty
[1:45:01] denomination
