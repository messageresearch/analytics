[1:36:51] I would like us to just ask the Lord for
[1:36:53] our blessing
[1:36:55] father Lord we
[1:36:57] would believe that this moment is a
[1:36:59] swarmed moment as we approach your word
[1:37:01] now
[1:37:02] yes
[1:37:10] realize without you I can do nothing
[1:37:18] as you've dropped that dropped it down
[1:37:22] on my heart
[1:37:23] may you now give me utterances
[1:37:28] let me only speak what you want me to
[1:37:30] speak
[1:37:32] let me be silent where I would speak
[1:37:36] and that you would speak Lord to your
[1:37:38] people
[1:37:41] in Jesus Christ
[1:37:46] so uh as a disclaimer I want to say that
[1:37:49] I'm a bit wearing the In the Flesh I
[1:37:51] don't think that I'll do much of a
[1:37:52] preaching today
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:38:29] so yesterday I was in entebbe at the
[1:38:32] fellowship there
[1:38:34] is
[1:38:36] we had a good time with the young people
[1:38:39] we had about maybe 15 or 12 I don't
[1:38:42] remember
[1:38:42] [Music]
[1:38:45] they want us to keep going back today so
[1:38:49] we we should continue to pray for those
[1:38:52] young people there
[1:38:54] I believe something will come out of
[1:38:57] there because you know they have about
[1:38:59] two or three who are really interested
[1:39:01] in hearing the message
[1:39:05] foreign that they have questions
[1:39:09] actually one one young girl one young
[1:39:12] lady she's
[1:39:16] um she she was asking me about women
[1:39:18] preachers
[1:39:20] and so from there we had gone to the
[1:39:24] Genesis to speak on the serpent seed
[1:39:25] fast
[1:39:30] can use of the rebounding so we we did
[1:39:33] not conclude
[1:39:35] so uh you remember them in prayer
[1:39:39] now speaking on Rescue the perishing
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:45] my mind goes back many years ago
[1:39:51] when my mother used to uh you know my of
[1:39:55] course my family where I was raised
[1:39:57] there were ministers
[1:40:01] my father I preacher my mother I
[1:40:03] preacher
[1:40:05] and so they used to especially my mother
[1:40:09] she used to see those children that have
[1:40:12] been malnutritioned
[1:40:17] and maybe they have a big belly
[1:40:21] and then should you know bring them home
[1:40:26] and take care of them I remember there
[1:40:29] is this one little child
[1:40:43] and as you know she started to take care
[1:40:46] of her
[1:40:47] and you know you know I have Billy which
[1:40:50] was big like this
[1:40:52] you know started to subside she became
[1:40:56] normal and started eating normally
[1:40:59] and you see how
[1:41:02] my mother Joy
[1:41:05] when these people you know something
[1:41:07] happened in their lives
[1:41:11] at our home we were never alone
[1:41:15] we always had these children that my
[1:41:19] mother was taking care of
[1:41:23] I don't know uh I don't know no my
[1:41:26] mother that my mother is here maybe I
[1:41:27] can have the liberty of asking her how
[1:41:29] many do you have at home
[1:41:35] six how many of those are your
[1:41:37] grandchildrens
[1:41:41] looks like she's continuing with her
[1:41:43] business
[1:41:45] because I mean like how many
[1:41:47] grandchildren do you have in Toto
[1:41:58] she only has one at home
[1:42:03] of our grandchildren and then there are
[1:42:06] others
[1:42:07] five of them are not related right in
[1:42:11] any way
[1:42:13] but she's
[1:42:15] allow me to use the word rescuing them
[1:42:19] and I believe it's a good attitude
[1:42:23] when I looked at my life I noticed I'm
[1:42:25] kind of maybe my mother spoiled me I'm
[1:42:27] kind of it's very difficult for me
[1:42:32] to see someone in need
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:46] I always feel that it's a responsibility
[1:42:49] that I have to take up
[1:42:52] but I come to think of either this is
[1:42:55] not
[1:42:56] um only physical
[1:42:59] condition but it is also spiritual
[1:43:03] and here in the scripture
[1:43:06] is that Jesus Christ gave a parable yes
[1:43:12] and you know this man as he was coming
[1:43:16] from Jerusalem going to Jericho
[1:43:19] he fell among Thieves now if you've been
[1:43:23] in one of our traditional churches
[1:43:25] you've had this many times
[1:43:29] but today I will not approach it in a
[1:43:33] denomination or religious way
[1:43:43] s
[1:43:45] you can get the application of these
[1:43:47] things
[1:43:49] so this man coming from Jericho going to
[1:43:52] Jerusalem coming from Jerusalem going to
[1:43:54] Jericho um
[1:43:56] he fell among Thieves
[1:43:59] and they stripped to him
[1:44:02] of his clothes they wounded him
[1:44:06] and they departed they left this man
[1:44:10] half dead
[1:44:12] and now the Bible says by chance
[1:44:16] and now some of you believe in chance
[1:44:22] oh believe in um
[1:44:27] praise the name of the Lord
[1:44:29] but I believe
[1:44:32] we are not
[1:44:34] chance
[1:44:39] the people we meet in life
[1:44:41] we don't meet them by communities
[1:44:44] we don't even meet them by chance
[1:44:48] but allow me to say we meet them by God
[1:44:51] is designed
[1:44:54] are you hearing me you see we are at a
[1:44:59] place
[1:45:00] where I can 100 say that we are standing
[1:45:03] right in the middle of the will of God
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:10] if you're hearing what I'm speaking to
[1:45:12] you today
[1:45:13] you are hearing the will of God for your
[1:45:16] life
[1:45:21] if you believe it is
[1:45:36] what did the priest
[1:45:38] see nothing don't worry he saw him he
[1:45:42] passed by the other side
[1:45:44] and he said likewise
[1:45:49] he looked on him that he passed by on
[1:45:52] the other side but he says
[1:46:05] the Bible did not say by chance
[1:46:09] are you following me the Bible you know
[1:46:12] you remember when Jesus was passing by
[1:46:14] uh Samaria
[1:46:17] the Bible did not say by chance
[1:46:22] but the Bible says he needed to pass
[1:46:25] them
[1:46:29] it was by design
[1:46:32] it was by foreign
[1:46:55] he
[1:46:59] looked on him
[1:47:05] and he went to him and bound up his
[1:47:09] wounds
[1:47:10] powering in oil and wine
[1:47:21] my mind Russia is not Ethiopia
[1:47:25] one time in Ethiopia he was driving my
[1:47:29] daughter to school Elizabeth
[1:47:32] you know just around her school
[1:47:35] I find this um this young man
[1:47:43] but you know
[1:47:45] um he he looked like he was having him
[1:47:48] and so when I looked on him my heart you
[1:47:53] know was filled with compassion
[1:47:55] and I said to myself
[1:47:58] before I could drop my daughter I had to
[1:48:01] stop the car and I talked to him
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:31] recently he was telling me that you know
[1:48:33] he sent me a picture when he's driving
[1:48:35] he said he said he said I'm driving
[1:48:40] I said praise the Lord
[1:48:42] and now in the physical it looks like a
[1:48:45] very good thing
[1:48:47] it is a very fulfilling thing in the
[1:48:51] physical to help somebody
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:54] feel that fulfilling
[1:48:57] a feeling
[1:49:00] be a Good Samaritan
[1:49:03] but today I don't want to speak on the
[1:49:06] physical that much
[1:49:08] I want to speak on the spiritual and so
[1:49:12] you went on and and to him and he bound
[1:49:15] up his wounds
[1:49:17] oil and wine
[1:49:20] on his own he said him on his own beast
[1:49:23] and brought him
[1:49:26] and he took care of him and on tomorrow
[1:49:30] when he departed he took out two pens
[1:49:34] and give to them to the hosts and gave
[1:49:37] them to the horse and said to him
[1:49:40] take care of this young man
[1:49:42] and whatever you spend more
[1:49:45] I will come again
[1:49:47] and I will repay
[1:49:51] I don't believe that this story is just
[1:49:54] a story
[1:49:56] Jesus spoke in Parable yes
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:49] [Music]
[1:50:57] to perish on foreign
[1:51:12] how the Mana came down from heaven and
[1:51:14] got a man we call it Angel's food
[1:51:20] and then he says
[1:51:23] Jesus Christ
[1:51:24] God himself coming down from glory
[1:51:29] and he came down to the Earth and he
[1:51:33] says he died he came to die
[1:51:39] so that he might rescue the parish
[1:51:43] he says he was Heavenly
[1:51:49] make us
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:58] if he did not leave his glory
[1:52:02] come down to a place that is despised
[1:52:06] can you imagine God himself
[1:52:48] [Applause]
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:53:09] amen God himself
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:28] do you ever think of it Christ became me
[1:53:31] that I might become him
[1:53:35] and he says oh my that would shake the
[1:53:38] heart of an infidels
[1:53:43] if we ever looked at it
[1:53:48] Christ becoming sin Christopher
[1:53:52] knowing no sin yet he was medicine
[1:53:57] that through the righteousness of his
[1:54:00] life
[1:54:05] would might be redeemed and stand by his
[1:54:07] side
[1:54:10] do you know that the Bible says
[1:54:15] came to Christ
[1:54:18] having murdered an unbeliever
[1:54:23] the believer sanctifies
[1:54:29] in the same way
[1:54:31] if a woman came to church
[1:54:35] Christo having previously married an
[1:54:37] unbeliever
[1:54:39] attack
[1:54:41] sanctifies
[1:54:45] that's what marriage is
[1:54:51] if that wasn't the case
[1:54:54] the children they give back
[1:54:57] would have been how do they call them
[1:55:01] yep
[1:55:03] [Music]
[1:55:05] bastards yes
[1:55:07] but you see now he says they are holy
[1:55:10] because the the other one sanctifies the
[1:55:12] others
[1:55:15] Jesus Christ came down from glory and he
[1:55:20] was United with us and he is Holiness
[1:55:23] becomes ours
[1:55:26] in other words
[1:55:34] glory to God now I want us to look about
[1:55:37] three to about to look on about three or
[1:55:40] four things here from Jerusalem to
[1:55:42] Jericho
[1:55:46] that's one thing I want us to look at is
[1:55:50] it has a very big significance
[1:55:53] now he says in our sin our sin is at a
[1:55:57] very cast City Jericho
[1:56:00] our sin the sin here of this man
[1:56:06] the man coming from from Jerusalem
[1:56:11] going to Jericho now
[1:56:18] and a man like we read of the Good
[1:56:20] Samaritans
[1:56:22] when he was coming down from Jerusalem
[1:56:25] going to Jericho
[1:56:27] he was backsliding
[1:56:31] coming out of the of the city of the
[1:56:33] blessings
[1:56:35] going to the city of the Cox
[1:56:38] and that's when he fell among things
[1:56:41] spirit

[2:28:12] what are we looking for Teacher to know
[2:28:15] you are looking for character
[2:28:17] now let me tell you if you're a Son of
[2:28:21] God you will not look for an appealing
[2:28:24] dressy woman
[2:28:28] because you are not looking for a
[2:28:30] prostitute

[2:28:33] children
[2:28:34] you are looking for for your legacy
[2:28:38] you are looking for a daughter of God
[2:28:42] of good places like a princess
[2:28:47] the reason why you don't see this
[2:28:50] because your eyes
[2:28:55] you need something in the Book of
[2:28:59] Revelation 3. the Bible says you need
[2:29:02] eyes
[2:29:03] so that it can be applied on you so that
[2:29:08] you can see the right way
[2:29:11] when I saw my wife
[2:29:13] for the first time she wasn't appealing
[2:29:17] yeah

[2:30:59] either past Trends
[2:31:03] there have been many Trends in the past
[2:31:06] a giant of clothing
[2:31:09] many Trends was bell bottom while using
[2:31:13] a nine one see there was buggy
[2:31:16] there was quite many I mean even short
[2:31:20] Sunday
[2:31:21] but the whole of those Fashions
[2:31:25] we are covering the men up real good
[2:31:30] but now there was developed a new trend
[2:31:34] in the sixth Century
[2:31:36] it is to make men look like women
[2:31:41] because you find a man
[2:31:44] a real man um foreign
[2:32:00] foreign
[2:32:27] boys
[2:32:51] the Devil is a deceiver
[2:32:53] he has killed the generation but we are
[2:32:57] coming today

[2:33:04] all the sons of God out of that
[2:33:08] messed up
[2:33:26] and bring them to church
[2:33:29] everybody
[2:33:31] the devil has a Sinister motive
[2:33:35] question deceived the generations
[2:33:39] taught boys their girls and they are
[2:33:42] told girls they are boys
[2:33:46] it's a shame Johnson is a shame friends
[2:33:52] completely strip the generation for
[2:33:54] physical and Spirits
[2:33:56] the physical registration only shows the
[2:33:59] spiritual state of the church
[2:34:02] the church has been completely strict
[2:34:06] of all the Bible doctrines
[2:34:09] you find them baptizing babies
[2:34:15] and it is not nowhere in the Bible
[2:34:18] you find them believing in the Trinity
[2:34:21] of God
[2:34:29] that is wrong
[2:34:32] the three don't agree in one uh
[2:34:37] that's what the Bible says
[2:35:05] the position and the place of a wife in
[2:35:07] a home
[2:35:10] the place of her husband
[2:35:13] it has been completely confused
[2:35:17] they think they are going there as
[2:35:19] partners
[2:35:23] in marriage you are not Partners
[2:35:27] according to the teaching of the Bible
[2:35:30] in marriage
[2:35:36] and your wife is a part of you brother
[2:35:41] the Bible instructs the man to love his
[2:35:43] wife
[2:35:45] his own body the Bible instructs the
[2:35:48] woman who has made herself to us
[2:35:51] unto the Lord
[2:35:54] and he says
[2:36:06] that's the teaching of the Bible
[2:36:08] everybody
[2:36:33] strip the people from the world
[2:36:38] you find women preachers everywhere
[2:36:43] put that scripture there first Timothy
[2:36:45] chapter 2.
[2:36:57] you're not allowed to do that
[2:37:00] or even to be a deacon according to
[2:37:02] First Timothy chapter three
[2:37:05] now if you are you're fighting with that
[2:37:08] you fight with the Bible
[2:37:11] that have stripped the church
[2:37:18] they have not known the grace of Jesus
[2:37:21] Christ
[2:37:27] you see like you know it's Grace you can
[2:37:29] do what you want
[2:37:31] you see all these things
[2:37:38] that God has restored the true Reign men
[2:37:48] now you are close

[2:38:43] this is what he does he wants to give it
[2:38:47] to every child
[2:38:51] powering oil and wine
[2:38:56] and set him on his own business
[2:39:01] and he brought him into the end
[2:39:03] took care of him
[2:39:07] in the third seal he would say here that
[2:39:10] now oil symbolizes the spirit

[2:39:19] so they can follow me I'll give you a
[2:39:20] few verses if you want
[2:39:23] there's two scriptures in Leviticus
[2:39:27] before he went in had to be Anointed
[2:39:30] with oil
[2:39:38] of oil coming powering through pipes

[2:39:45] another thing if you want to see in
[2:39:47] Matthew
[2:39:51] the foolish virgins had no oil
[2:39:59] in her life
[2:40:07] the spirit all your types the spirit
