[6:23] of god it is such an opportunity it is
[6:26] such a great honor and even tonight i
[6:28] want you to be expectant to receive from
[6:31] the lord for the bible says
[6:33] he said in his word that where two or
[6:36] three shall be gathered he promised that
[6:38] he will be in their midst amen but as
[6:41] the prophet of the hour preached the
[6:43] message expectation when you come to his
[6:47] presence what are you expecting what is
[6:50] that on your heart did you come to
[6:52] church because every wednesday we come
[6:55] did you come to church because you had
[6:56] nothing to do or you came to church like
[6:59] that woman who had the issue of blood
[7:02] who said i must go where that man is
[7:05] when i reach there and i touch him my
[7:08] life will not be will not remain the
[7:10] same amen let me hope you like that
[7:13] woman and tonight have come to hear from
[7:16] your father

[7:21] is being placed on each side storms of
[7:25] life are so hard on us
[7:27] hallelujah
[7:29] but i remember that day
[7:31] when the disciples were in the boat
[7:33] and the storms on the sea
[7:36] were beating the boat on all the sides
[7:39] but i want to thank god for the
[7:41] disciples knew the secret they went and
[7:45] woke him up and said master
[7:48] oh hallelujah
[7:50] no matter how the storms were so much
[7:53] the bible says that when the master woke
[7:56] up he just raised his hand
[7:59] and he said to the sick come
[8:02] and be still
[8:05] and as we are going to sing these hippo
[8:07] chorus

[8:45] surely he wakes up and comes the seas
[8:49] and comes the storm

[18:40] so
[18:50] father we want to thank you for the
[18:51] blessing
[19:00] [Music]
[19:21] yesterday by god's grace i traveled to
[19:25] eastern uganda
[19:30] eastern uganda
[19:32] in the first quarter
[19:48] [Music]
[19:49] since last week i've been very
[20:00] [Music]
[20:06] and uh i know we
[20:08] i do not know if you remember i do not
[20:10] know if we are announced i don't
[20:11] remember did we announce that sister
[20:13] sister stella was sick
[20:31] is now well
[20:34] she's recovering
[20:37] yeah so we believe for her for
[20:39] recovering
[20:42] so this evening i have something on my
[20:45] heart that i would like to share with
[20:46] the church
[21:03] so i'd like you to uh i know on
[21:05] wednesday we have very short time
[21:07] shimano rocks
[21:09] so we should make every minute count
[21:11] category
[21:25] so this evening i'm speaking
[21:27] on the blessing of the lord
[21:32] the blessing of the lord
[21:36] now we have read in proverbs 10 2 which
[21:38] says the blessing of the lord it maketh
[21:40] rich
[21:53] [Music]
[21:55] you have some kind of echo you need to
[21:57] work on that now
[21:58] i know there are many ways we can be
[22:00] able to approach scripture
[22:06] we can approach it in many ways
[22:11] [Music]
[22:23] i believe that the holy spirit has a way
[22:25] that he brings the word which is the
[22:28] common scriptures
[22:29] and makes it applies it in your
[22:31] situation
[22:47] and i'm sure that uh if you have come
[22:49] here desiring to hear from him you will
[22:51] hear from him
[23:03] [Music]
[23:06] the blessing of the lord it makes rich
[23:08] and he adds no sorrow with it
[23:15] if you have it there can we read it
[23:17] together one more time
[23:20] no
[23:21] okay it's right here on the screen for
[23:23] you if you do not have it taste one
[23:26] everybody together
[23:28] the blessing of the lord
[23:31] it maketh rich
[23:33] and
[23:45] people think that
[23:47] if you have many cars you are rich
[24:10] and sometimes maybe even us we have
[24:13] fought like that sometimes
[24:26] these people say they are rich and
[24:29] increased with goods and have need of
[24:31] nothing
[24:32] here
[24:36] and then he says god says that they are
[24:40] poor they are wretched and they do not
[24:43] know it
[24:55] now of course physically speaking the
[24:57] people of our generation are very rich
[25:03] if you look at uh
[25:05] some of your phones
[25:07] you have a phone that even king david
[25:10] never had
[25:12] what to
[25:19] [Music]
[25:41] uh you know knowledge has increased
[25:45] and so very many new things
[25:48] are now uh
[25:49] are now here that did not used to be
[25:51] here
[25:51] orero why do we have intuitive
[25:54] ebitda
[26:07] they think they have a lot and increase
[26:08] with goods and have need of nothing
[26:13] because of the
[26:14] uh many material goods that they have
[26:17] already into every quarter cave
[26:20] people chase after these material goods
[26:26] maybe you know we don't even have time
[26:28] for prayer because we are chasing after
[26:30] the material boots
[26:35] sometimes people don't even come to
[26:36] church because they are chasing after
[26:38] the material goods
[26:43] ask them where are you when i was at
[26:45] work
[26:49] why because they are trying to find
[26:52] something some money
[26:56] so you realize that everybody almost
[26:58] everyone that works on the road
[27:00] they are looking for money
[27:06] [Applause]
[27:18] if you have a nice phone and you see
[27:20] someone with another phone you want to
[27:22] get what they have
[27:28] you know there is that confessions
[27:32] there is that spirit of love of loving
[27:34] the world and the things of the world
[27:39] to be honest if we were speaking on
[27:40] sunday
[27:41] that is walking in the flesh if we have
[27:44] we love the world and the things of the
[27:46] world then the love of god is not even
[27:48] in us
[27:55] even if you have all the world you can
[27:57] never be satisfied
[28:30] no matter how many houses you own that
[28:33] fast in your heart can never be quenched
[28:39] no matter how many clothes you own and
[28:41] how many closets you feel
[28:45] [Music]
[28:50] did you know that the more money you get
[28:53] the more money you really need
[28:57] [Music]
[28:59] these things of the world can never
[29:01] satisfy us all erin to the end say no to
[29:04] him
[29:06] that is why a true child of god amen
[29:09] will keep their eyes on jesus
[29:23] amen for the blessing of god what would
[29:25] i have known
[29:27] that's the blessing of god it makes you
[29:30] rich
[29:34] with the riches
[29:35] that will always make you happy
[29:55] and i would like us to look at
[29:57] genesis 12.
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] here
[30:15] now the lord had said unto abram
[30:18] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[30:21] kindred and from thy father's house
[30:25] and to a land that i will chose thee
[30:40] and i will make of thee a great nation
[30:44] and i will bless thee and make thy name
[30:46] great and thou shalt be a blessing
[31:02] [Music]
[31:06] shall all
[31:07] families of the ass be blessed
[31:09] [Music]
[31:18] praise the name of the lord amen now now
[31:20] i want you to look at somebody here
[31:23] come on that was a sinner like all the
[31:25] rest of us
[31:28] but he found grace and favor in the
[31:29] sight of the lord they have finished
[31:32] us from massachusetts
[31:33] something very good find favor and grace
[31:36] in the sight of the lord
[31:41] and when he found that faith in grace
[31:47] [Music]
[31:58] a christian and the lord never speaks to
[32:00] you then you need to check you need to
[32:02] check your christianity
[32:08] maybe you are not giving him enough time
[32:10] to speak to you oh yeah
[32:41] get out of your country from your people
[32:44] from your father's house and to the land
[32:47] which i will show you again
[32:54] and i will make
[33:09] you so that you can be blessed
[33:14] you don't need to meet rich people for
[33:16] you to be blessed
[33:20] you don't need any of that
[33:28] [Music]
[33:34] amen because when abraham met god
[33:50] when you hear the voice of god calling
[33:52] on you
[33:56] no
[33:57] blessing has to come on his way
[34:01] am i preaching to someone this is
[34:06] i want you to follow me very very
[34:08] attentively
[34:13] these words that i have on my heart
[34:15] every gamble you know
[34:17] will have an effect on your life
[34:25] you should connect with me so you can
[34:26] connect with the holy spirit
[34:29] amen it says i said it will have an
[34:31] effect on your life
[34:36] if only you can
[34:37] receive it in the right way singapore is
[34:40] a hungarian truth
[34:52] abraham
[34:54] ibrahim
[34:56] god speaks to him and tells him to go
[34:58] out of his father's house
[35:04] [Music]
[35:19] [Music]
[35:41] so that he can make our name great
[35:44] food near the affair today tells us to
[35:46] bow down to him
[35:49] so that he can make us a great nation at
[35:51] fully gwanga dinner but that is a lie oh
[35:54] the devil cannot make you anything
[35:56] satanic
[36:11] amen i mean you're finding our
[36:12] generation that we are living in oh
[36:14] never mind
[36:16] not very many people are homeless
[36:21] the holy spirit wants to find a place
[36:24] where he can rest
[36:33] we think
[36:35] we can
[36:36] we can mock god and get away with it you
[36:38] know
[36:42] we think he doesn't know our hearts
[36:47] do you realize god knows your heart more
[36:49] than you know yourselves
[36:52] that's
[37:34] national
[38:18] amen if you know amen what you believe
[38:22] i need your kids and if you hear the
[38:24] call of the lord nor will he look for
[38:26] you
[38:26] follow his leadership no community
[38:29] close your ears from whatever voices
[38:31] that come galawa
[38:35] you remember when abram got when he had
[38:38] to make a choice to go in the desert
[38:42] it was a bad choice it said why did
[39:12] amen
[39:14] [Music]
[39:38] and here abraham
[39:40] god
[40:08] abraham only to think about yourself
[40:18] identify yourself with it
[40:25] [Music]
[40:35] i believe i was predestinated for the
[40:38] blessing of the lord
[40:44] if you believe it can use food on your
[40:46] lips
[40:48] i am predestinated for the blessing of
[40:50] the lord
[40:54] before the foundation of the world
[40:57] sing against the united st
[41:17] [Music]
[41:32] the moment
[41:47] i want i want to demonstrate this for
[41:48] you very well here
[41:51] abram was with his father
[41:55] he was with his wife
[41:58] and he was with his cousin a lot
[42:15] i i i i i preached on on a person of god
[42:19] some time back
[42:23] and i dealt with that so much
[42:27] they were in a place called haran
[42:31] and you remember
[42:32] the father of abraham
[42:36] he was dreaming
[42:37] of a land
[42:40] called cannon
[42:42] do you know he wanted terra the father
[42:45] of abraham he wanted to take abram
[42:54] but by that time
[42:56] terah was with lord
[42:58] his um
[43:00] grandson
[43:01] and he was also with the abram and his
[43:05] wife
[43:10] garina
[43:37] so there was no blessing in that journey
[43:41] because that journey was not
[43:44] inspired by god
[43:50] it was an inspiration from
[43:58] and we have found out also that
[44:00] whatever abram did during that journey
[44:04] in going to canon was
[44:06] out of his own efforts according to the
[44:09] inspiration of his father
[44:34] god
[44:41] do you know many times when you make
[44:42] moves and movements and and steps in
[44:45] your life if you are not inspired by god
[44:47] you can never have
[45:00] between working in the spirit and
[45:02] working in the flesh
[45:09] [Music]
[45:14] but if you walk in the flesh everything
[45:16] you do can never have the blessing of
[45:19] god upon it
[45:24] if you are walking in the spirit
[45:27] whatever you are doing is to please the
[45:29] the lord
[45:57] and sisters
[46:52] [Music]
[47:36] he left the presence of the lord
[47:39] amen he never no longer had the blessing
[47:45] and so
[47:47] he now phoned sorrow
[47:50] for them
[48:01] the bible god himself said to him
[48:04] he said you will
[48:44] [Applause]
[48:46] [Music]
[48:57] and whatever you are doing you cannot
[48:59] find peace and love
[49:16] those who have joined us later i'm
[49:17] speaking on the blessing of the lord and
[49:18] i'm reading i read from proverbs 10 22
[49:21] and right now we're reading from genesis
[49:56] he was a
[50:24] when you
[50:44] [Music]
[51:18] and you see the calling of god is
[51:20] usually followed with a blessing
[51:26] amen
[51:27] when you heard that when you hear that
[51:29] call well
[51:30] why would you don't quit and you respond
[51:33] now we know
[51:34] just
[51:38] [Music]
[52:15] that's why i can't understand these
[52:16] people who
[52:18] have always to break cusses from
[52:20] believers
[52:28] and these people pay a lot of money
[53:12] but after
[53:27] i mean that's why when god called
[53:29] abraham
[53:31] he said to him this way
[53:34] he said i will make you a great nation
[53:38] not a prophet or an anointed man who
[53:41] makes you great
[53:46] the blessing of god makes you great
[53:51] amen
[53:53] and he says i will bless thee
[54:03] the word of god already has blessed you
[54:39] [Applause]
[55:40] [Music]
[55:45] abraham had previously you know
[55:49] been
[55:50] living in haran
[55:55] but that decision was made by his father
[56:10] you have to change this place yeah you
[56:11] don't choose
[56:13] you have to change his dwelling place
[56:17] amen he had even the status quo had to
[56:19] change around him
[56:23] as long as
[56:24] what he was now doing was agreeing with
[56:26] god's vision he had to change
[56:55] how can a person that believes the word
[56:58] of god is under the blessing of god walk
[57:00] with them that do not believe the word
[57:02] of god
[57:09] that is why sometimes when the lord
[57:11] calls us
[57:14] and we believe his wife
[57:16] and we walk under the blessing of the
[57:17] lord
[57:19] for us to retain this grace upon us
[57:25] we have jesus change certain things in
[57:27] our life why do we have been traveling
[57:28] we are truly not true someone would have
[57:30] been so some covenant why do we win
[57:33] again
[57:35] we have to separate from some people
[57:37] when you have entered actually
[57:53] corinthian empire to move from haran
[57:56] aiming to go to canada
[57:59] again
[58:01] abraham had to separate even from his
[58:03] good friend and his brother and his
[58:06] cousin lord
[58:17] you would have the blessing of the lord
[58:34] you commando quiet talking in heaven to
[58:37] our channel because you are in the wrong
[58:39] place
[58:41] you have wrong friendships oh the name
[58:43] is
[58:45] one tomato which is bad and decayed and
[58:47] rotten in your
[59:30] you cannot
[59:44] it is thing to have the blessing of the
[59:46] lord
[59:50] to be rich
[59:53] to be happy
[59:56] but if you do what the word of god
[1:00:12] hallelujah
[1:00:14] the blessing of the lord would always
[1:00:16] follow when you make the right decision
[1:00:24] i want to show you in the scriptures
[1:00:54] lords
[1:00:56] some of you have lots that you need to
[1:00:58] break out
[1:01:01] they may not even be physical
[1:01:06] maybe certain things you love doing gps
[1:01:37] is one of the worst of its kinds
[1:01:39] [Music]
[1:01:42] i will show you by the way
[1:01:45] genesis 13.
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:49] we will read from uh we might read the
[1:01:53] 13 verses out of genesis 13 so but let's
[1:01:55] see how it will go let us begin from
[1:01:57] verse 1.
[1:02:00] and abram went up out of egypt he and
[1:02:03] his wife and all that he had
[1:02:06] and a lot with him into the south
[1:02:17] again
[1:02:41] by this time
[1:02:42] the calling of the lord upon his life
[1:02:44] had given him the blessing of the lord
[1:02:46] and he had already made him rich
[1:02:55] and he went on his journeys from the
[1:02:57] south even to bethel and to the place
[1:02:59] where his tent had been at the beginning
[1:03:02] between bethel and high
[1:03:04] now
[1:03:14] and under the place of the altar which
[1:03:17] he had met there at the first and there
[1:03:20] abraham called the name of the lord much
[1:03:22] foreign
[1:03:42] bible where that goes from bible when uh
[1:03:46] when
[1:03:48] eve gave birth to king
[1:03:50] cowan
[1:03:52] she said i have gotten a man from the
[1:03:55] lord
[1:04:25] from that moment she her name was
[1:04:27] changed from woman meaning a part of the
[1:04:29] man
[1:04:30] to eve mother of all living
[1:04:35] area
[1:04:54] does that mean
[1:04:55] it means
[1:04:58] was mother of both cain and abel
[1:05:04] but adam was father
[1:05:20] and when that
[1:05:47] here's what she said
[1:06:06] eve gives a distinction between the two
[1:06:10] seeds the seed of said struck a bell and
[1:06:13] the seed of cane
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:16] get out
[1:06:45] not at third seed he was simply a
[1:06:47] replacement of abel's seed
[1:06:57] when seth was born that says where is
[1:07:00] his lineage
[1:07:02] the bible says i believe then men began
[1:07:05] to call upon the name of the lord
[1:07:22] [Applause]
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:22] yes we have a command amen why right
[1:08:25] because that is the name of the lord
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:30] in the name of jesus
[1:08:32] the devil doesn't like it
[1:08:35] from the moment jesus died and rose
[1:08:37] again
[1:08:41] hated that name
[1:08:44] they were hunting everyone who believed
[1:08:46] in it
[1:08:48] and sometimes when they arrested some
[1:08:50] disciples
[1:09:18] all over the world
[1:11:23] lord had all these riches because of his
[1:11:26] brother abram
[1:11:31] but the biggest mistake that abraham
[1:11:34] made was to keep lord around him
[1:11:38] yes
[1:11:52] the land of
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:45] and so
[1:12:46] that was the blessing overflowing
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:13:18] and there was a strife between the hard
[1:13:20] men of abraham's cattle and the hard men
[1:13:22] of lords cattle and the canaanites and
[1:13:25] the parasite 12 10 in the land
[1:13:44] you
[1:13:45] you also have your riches
[1:13:48] the bible says
[1:13:50] that moses musa he did not esteem the
[1:13:53] riches of egypt
[1:13:58] yesterday human being
[1:14:01] with his brethren in their poverty more
[1:14:04] than the riches of egypt
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:40] and whenever
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:15:17] the word of god
[1:15:35] is
[1:16:05] house
[1:16:07] as a matter of fact we should leave rich
[1:16:09] amazing
[1:16:11] god the riches the world gives what will
[1:16:13] happen
[1:16:16] the blessing that lord gives brings its
[1:16:18] own riches
[1:16:32] lord let there be no strength i pray
[1:16:35] between me and thee and between my heart
[1:16:38] men and thy heart men for we are
[1:16:39] brothers
[1:16:46] and now
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:05] then i will go to the right or without
[1:17:07] the part to the right and then i will go
[1:17:09] to the left
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:19:18] the blessing of the lord will be on you
[1:19:20] forever
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:46] inheritance may be caught in history at
[1:19:48] the beginning but the end they wrote
[1:19:50] shall not be blessed
[1:19:58] praise the lord
[1:20:00] even as a church we are not looking for
[1:20:04] we believe that the lord has blessed us
[1:20:06] that nothing can satisfy them come out
[1:20:09] and we believe you will give us a
[1:20:10] tabernacle
[1:20:13] that is if the lord is
[1:20:30] but we don't want to give
[1:20:45] will not be blessed
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:49] amen amina we know where we are standing
[1:20:51] situation
[1:20:53] as a church get cancer all these little
[1:20:55] contributions we are making
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:55] you should believe for big things my kid
[1:21:57] is your way into having any believing
[1:21:59] big things does that mean you just go
[1:22:01] and touch people's things and say claim
[1:22:02] it
[1:22:07] that is not faith
[1:23:05] if you find that woman who met elijah
[1:23:11] he told us
[1:23:17] whatever packets
[1:23:32] foreign
[1:23:45] so we can understand we have
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:43] you can do that
[1:24:44] actually
[1:24:46] what am i talking about tonight
[1:24:49] i'm talking about the blessing of god
[1:24:52] god gives his blessing
[1:24:56] to those that answer the call
[1:25:01] not the way it has been told that you
[1:25:03] know you go to a man he anoints you with
[1:25:04] oil you do this you do that that's all
[1:25:07] that is
[1:25:24] an inheritance may be good and history
[1:25:26] at the beginning but the end thereof
[1:25:28] shall not be blessed
[1:25:37] 82.
[1:25:52] that poverty shall come upon him
[1:25:59] oh god
[1:26:00] i don't know
[1:26:02] let us not be quick let us not look at
[1:26:04] riches
[1:26:08] you know what jesus told my neighbor
[1:26:11] what he told it made some people to
[1:26:13] believe that all the things that god
[1:26:15] wants us to be poor
[1:26:16] so yeah
[1:26:17] i remember
[1:26:20] gonna say
[1:26:48] not
[1:26:48] necessarily seated
[1:26:50] in the church
[1:26:59] not only to those who don't have it
[1:27:01] seriously
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:58] amen when he blesses you he makes you
[1:28:01] rich
[1:28:05] praise the name of the lord
[1:28:06] hallelujah
[1:28:09] i would like to request you to allow me
[1:28:11] to read you a quote
[1:28:37] he says now he gives a story of some
[1:28:40] young
[1:28:52] having this good godly
[1:28:54] parent
[1:29:00] when his daddy died when he was only 16
[1:29:03] years old and the people took and made
[1:29:05] him king chita away we have
[1:29:12] okay you can put that for the paper as
[1:29:13] well
[1:29:16] all right
[1:29:18] um
[1:29:21] yeah a little bit up there
[1:29:26] okay
[1:29:28] and he come on the throne of power when
[1:29:30] he was only 16 years old
[1:29:35] and if you will read his life
[1:29:39] he wasn't influenced by politics of his
[1:29:41] country
[1:29:45] he didn't take the popular opinion
[1:29:56] that's what was made uh him such a good
[1:29:59] example to this young prophet at the
[1:30:01] same time
[1:30:19] together
[1:30:25] stayed at the palace and he leaned upon
[1:30:28] the arm of the king
[1:30:32] yesterday and we find out that this
[1:30:35] young fellow's influence influenced
[1:30:37] isaiah he became a hero to isaiah
[1:30:41] oh no
[1:30:43] yes
[1:31:42] what's
[1:31:52] i told you that if you walk with god god
[1:31:54] will be with you and god will bless you
[1:31:55] never give me antibiotics
[1:32:02] and god and you know some kings usually
[1:32:05] allied with other kingdoms to be blessed
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:39] wonders
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:43] most of the technology today is
[1:32:45] coming from israel to technology
[1:32:50] because of the blessing of the lord
[1:33:29] and then
[1:33:30] king
[1:33:31] uh the king's kingdom
[1:33:33] spread our
[1:33:37] i guess he was next to solomon in his
[1:33:39] kingdom because of his influence it
[1:33:41] reached all the way down into egypt
[1:33:49] mystery so he says it was a great help
[1:33:50] to isaiah the young prophet to see that
[1:33:52] any man that would take a stand for god
[1:33:54] and regardless of politics or anything
[1:33:56] else he would stay straight with the
[1:33:58] words
[1:34:05] [Music]
[1:34:15] god will bless you if you stay true to
[1:34:17] the world
[1:34:21] now we find that this king all
[1:34:24] did did like
[1:34:25] like so many christians of today
[1:34:44] when he got everything secure
[1:34:47] then he became lifted up in his own self
[1:34:50] and then he was on his road out
[1:34:55] now that is so it is today
[1:35:02] it's always being that when men feel
[1:35:04] that they have become sufficient that
[1:35:07] they don't have to pray anymore they
[1:35:09] don't have to wait upon god for their
[1:35:11] ministry cheering
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:19] he says i agree with a certain writer
[1:36:20] that
[1:36:21] that's what has caused many of these men
[1:36:24] that has been in this latter day
[1:36:26] revivals all this last day revival to
[1:36:28] fly to pieces
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:44] some of them found they've been claimed
[1:36:46] to be drunk in their pulpit and some of
[1:36:49] them has done wrong it's because that
[1:36:51] they have such an influence on the
[1:36:53] people till they begin to feel that they
[1:36:56] are self-sufficient and that their
[1:36:58] little kingdom and that they can and god
[1:37:00] people so that their grief on the people
[1:37:02] that they can just do anything they want
[1:37:03] to and the people don't notice that
[1:37:14] they drink
[1:37:16] yes i mean they drink alcohol burn your
[1:37:19] mind and they come on the pool
[1:37:23] whether this is happening
[1:37:32] they tell lies
[1:38:15] god not says it
[1:38:17] and if you want to finish up this quote
[1:38:19] i want you to take this message
[1:38:20] influence and read it
[1:38:26] where's brother marvin yeah raise up
