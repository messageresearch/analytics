[28:54] i have something that i'd like to speak
[28:56] to you from my

[29:16] and now as i uh
[29:18] see what the lord has for us
[29:23] for now i request you to stand on your
[29:24] feet if you can and let us read the
[29:26] scriptures
[29:31] genesis chapter 4 6-7
[29:39] i have uh very i caught a very important
[29:42] subject because it will address a lot of
[29:44] things that
[29:45] you know many young people could have in
[29:47] their minds
[29:57] [Music]
[30:07] unto cain
[30:08] why at thou wrath
[30:10] and why the continents
[30:14] if thou doest well
[30:16] shalt thou not be
[30:19] accepted
[30:20] and if thou doest not well
[30:23] see life at the door
[30:26] and unto thee shall be his desire
[30:28] and thou shalt rule over him
[31:03] lord have blessings upon his word
[31:10] this morning
[31:12] i'm going to be speaking on the power of
[31:15] free moral agents
[31:23] this is
[31:25] going to ask for you to be
[31:27] very attentive to be able to grasp what
[31:30] the world spirit
[31:38] and i also request you to help me preach
[31:40] by receiving it by saying a man wherever
[31:42] you are
[31:59] if you're still standing you can be
[32:00] seated
[32:03] so now i'm speaking on the power
[32:06] of free moral agents
[32:13] as usual i don't usually plan to speak
[32:15] for long maybe an hour or less
[32:21] if at any time i got beyond one hour
[32:23] just to know the holy spirit is just
[32:25] trying to push me maybe someone else is
[32:27] still getting something
[32:35] now this subject
[32:36] is a very good subject to speak about
[32:38] during these trying times of the
[32:40] pandemic that is going on all over the
[32:43] world
[32:51] many people are blaming things that are
[32:54] happening around them towards the
[32:56] pandemic that is happening and going on
[33:07] again
[33:10] and so they are saying this is happening
[33:12] to me because of coffee
[33:17] that is happening to me because of
[33:19] coffee
[33:22] and if it weren't for coffee i wouldn't
[33:24] be this way
[33:26] but they went and uh some also blame
[33:29] others
[33:32] i was not
[33:33] you know
[33:35] just away from my job or laid off i
[33:37] wouldn't be this way singapore
[33:43] if i had not married this man i wouldn't
[33:45] be this way
[33:50] if i did not you know the problem is
[33:51] this woman oh
[33:53] my god
[33:54] you know the problem is that man that
[33:56] friend of mine that's so and so i'm a
[33:58] security final
[34:01] and so everybody thinks that their
[34:03] problem is someone
[34:11] so they think that they would not be in
[34:13] the situations or conditions they are in
[34:16] if they had not met someone in their
[34:18] lives
[34:32] one thing this morning
[34:35] but god has given a power to you the
[34:38] human race that he has not given to
[34:39] anything else
[34:41] [Applause]
[34:45] whatever happens around you and in your
[34:48] life is because of you
[34:54] brother said that the greatest enemy he
[34:56] had was william branham
[35:03] and therefore the greatest enemy that
[35:05] you have in your life that will hinder
[35:07] you that he needs you to achieve the
[35:09] things you want to achieve in your life
[35:11] is you know
[35:13] achieved
[35:21] [Music]
[35:32] [Applause]
[35:56] even jesus himself cannot force you to
[35:58] do anything
[36:02] power to do good is before you
[36:06] power to do bad is before you
[36:09] will be guaranteed so it is up to you to
[36:11] really do what you want to do
[36:16] if you want to be a good christian the
[36:18] power is in your hands
[36:22] this kind of power god never gave it to
[36:24] animals
[36:27] god never gave it to birds
[36:30] god never gave it to uh
[36:32] to the
[36:33] floor and found cartoon natives
[36:36] god never gave it to insects
[36:53] that god has given to the human race
[36:57] and that nothing will happen to them
[36:59] without their input
[37:05] god has decided to
[37:48] and the times
[38:10] [Applause]
[38:12] amen in the nature and in the image of
[38:15] god himself
[38:29] but there is something man never lost
[38:32] him
[38:34] man had it before the fall
[38:37] and the man still has it after the fall
[38:42] [Music]
[38:43] and that thing my brother and sister
[38:44] children of ghana is the power of free
[38:48] moral agency
[38:52] hallelujah
[38:53] [Music]
[38:54] before the fall
[38:57] how did the father
[39:12] in your motor
[39:41] what is acceptable
[39:45] and pleasing to me
[39:48] will you not be accepted
[39:51] the way
[39:53] now i wanted to remember that god here
[39:54] is talking to kane
[39:58] who is
[40:03] yes
[40:05] some people don't know that
[40:07] but it has been revealed to us in this
[40:09] precious message
[40:12] the king was not a seed of god declaring
[40:14] it
[40:16] was the seed of the serpent
[40:19] amen could not be saved
[40:36] if you do what is good single correct if
[40:39] you do what is acceptable to me
[40:43] if you do what is pleasing to me
[40:46] will you not be accepted don't kill this
[40:49] way so don't tell me that god was just
[40:52] telling lies
[40:56] don't tell me that god was just having a
[40:58] light moment just joking around
[41:03] god is
[41:04] god and it does not change
[41:07] and what he says
[41:09] he fulfilled
[41:11] and here he tells this voice
[41:14] he tells cain
[41:15] if you knew well
[41:17] i will accept
[41:31] if
[41:59] god has the power to save
[42:24] [Applause]
[42:28] its desire
[42:41] meaning to
[42:56] it is
[43:10] [Music]
[43:26] [Music]
[43:53] ye
[43:55] that is something that separates us
[44:00] from the rest of the creatures
[44:04] all the other creatures don't have this
[44:06] power
[44:08] you are responsible for your own actions
[44:20] yes can you tell yourself right now
[44:23] we're gandhi wherever you are you're not
[44:25] you're already tell yourself
[44:27] i am responsible for my own actions
[44:30] [Music]
[44:32] come on come on
[44:46] don't begin blaming the devil
[45:16] the
[45:17] [Music]
[45:36] [Applause]
[45:43] i am not a prophet
[45:58] some of you might say well just like a
[46:00] woman is chosen a woman doesn't choose
[46:02] herself so it's the man that chooses her
[46:05] career
[46:09] so you know this came to me
[46:11] as i was
[46:13] as i was you know combing my hair and
[46:15] then this revolution just dropped down
[46:16] you know chances
[46:20] and come to think of it and you know
[46:23] the man makes a choice
[46:41] brother also says we're gonna pronounce
[46:44] i did not prepare that quote here
[46:47] i know even but he also says
[46:50] that the sister also
[46:53] she has to make a choice
[46:59] let me see if i can get it quickly for
[47:00] you
[47:03] i think it is in the message the
[47:04] marriage of the lamb
[47:13] hallelujah amen
[47:16] if i don't get it we'll just quote it
[47:17] later
[47:21] this is good for young sisters and
[47:23] younger brothers
[47:29] and old ones
[47:32] for you to know
[47:34] that the choice you make jokes
[47:50] did you get it
[48:04] this just came to me moments ago and i
[48:06] did not be
[48:07] get the quote for you but i want to get
[48:08] it for you here
[48:14] just give me a moment
[48:17] if i get it number one
[48:32] all right
[48:33] the choosing of the bride
[48:37] uh
[48:38] okay brother you can just get these
[48:40] words in many things of life we are
[48:43] given a choice
[48:44] [Music]
[48:59] choose our own way that we want to live
[49:02] oh quest
[49:05] education is a choice
[49:08] we can choose whether we are going to be
[49:10] educated or whether we are not going to
[49:12] be educated
[49:25] boy and girl has to choose whether they
[49:28] are going to try to live right or not
[49:30] live right it is a choice
[49:38] choice is a good thing
[49:41] your eternal destination is a choice
[49:47] and maybe tonight some of you will make
[49:50] that choice
[49:53] of where you are going to spend eternity
[49:55] before this service ends tonight
[50:01] there will be one time that if you turn
[50:04] god down many times there will be one
[50:07] time you will never turn him down oh
[50:09] that you will turn him down the last
[50:10] time
[50:20] there is a line between mercy and
[50:21] judgment and it's a dangerous thing for
[50:23] a man or a woman boy or girl to step
[50:25] across that line for there is no return
[50:28] when you step across that dead life one
[50:31] word
[50:38] whatever
[50:42] so tonight it might be the time that
[50:44] many will make their decision where they
[50:47] will spend the endless eternity
[51:05] a younger man or a younger woman
[51:08] stepping out on life
[51:12] [Applause]
[51:17] has been given a right to make a choice
[51:34] the younger woman has a right to accept
[51:36] or to reject it
[51:41] but it is still a choice

[52:16] younger man to ask for marriage or to
[52:19] ask for love that one is not free to be
[52:21] a wife to anyone
[52:30] completely
[52:44] have you can't be done
[52:47] because that you can never make a good
[52:48] wife
[52:51] younger sister

[55:48] wise
[55:51] praise the name of the lord amen
[55:53] in a message of prisoner brother gave me
[55:55] that quote
[55:57] the prophet says something here very
[55:59] interesting
[56:21] because he must put every man on the
[56:24] same basis oh he put the first one he
[56:27] put the first man on the wrong buses
[56:36] [Music]
[56:43] if he must put every man on that as he
[56:45] must make every man as a free moral
[56:47] agent
[56:52] just like he did the first one
[56:55] if he does not give you a right of
[56:57] choice
[56:58] it means that you put the first man adam
[57:00] and eve on the wrong basis
[57:10] exactly tonight like adam and eve
[57:16] there is no difference
[57:18] right and wrong sex before either or
[57:20] either one of us uh
[57:24] hallelujah
[57:39] it's unfortunate it's a fortunate right
[57:41] and wrong since before you are happy
[57:45] you can make your choice
[57:50] that's the way adam and eve did it
[58:33] forget about those people who tell you
[58:35] it is god who caused everything to
[58:37] happen
[58:38] [Music]
[58:41] yeah the prophet says that god knew that
[58:44] adam would seal
[58:46] it
[59:01] so that you can do that choice to sin by
[59:04] himself
[59:08] and because god knew that would happen
[59:12] being a good god
[59:14] he wanted that to happen so that he can
[59:16] be a savior
[59:30] himself to bear the price of death
[59:38] he had to die
[59:40] so that the price can be paid
[59:44] and then it can go back to
[59:46] uh all over again to free moral agents
[59:54] and he says his subjects that desire to
[59:57] be free they could go
[1:00:11] what
[1:00:12] is

[1:20:14] out
[1:20:15] into a place
[1:20:17] folk before the fall
[1:20:21] and also is removing from us
[1:20:25] he's purging us
[1:20:28] of all the possibilities
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:58] i
[1:21:11] before the fall man
[1:21:16] [Applause]
[1:21:28] the kingdom of love is the plan of god
[1:21:30] to ev to end evil and suffering for us
[1:21:38] give me first christian chapter 15.
[1:21:40] according
[1:21:52] then come at the end when he shall when
[1:21:54] he shall have delivered
[1:21:57] up the kingdom
[1:21:59] to god even the father when he shall
[1:22:01] have put down all rule
[1:22:04] and all authority and power for he must
[1:22:06] reign till he has put all enemies under
[1:22:09] his feet the last enemy shall be
[1:22:11] destroyed is death
[1:22:49] under his feet
[1:23:08] he has put all things under his feet but
[1:23:10] when he said all things are put under
[1:23:12] his him it is manifest that he is
[1:23:14] accepted
[1:23:15] which did put all things under him and
[1:23:17] when all things shall be subdued unto
[1:23:19] him then shall the son also himself be
[1:23:21] subject unto him that put all things
[1:23:23] under him that god may be all in all

[1:25:02] recognizing that that endless decisions
[1:25:05] are necessary to daily life
[1:25:07] can deny the fact of free acts and
[1:25:10] conduct

[1:25:15] again no one recognizing that endless
[1:25:18] decisions are necessary to daily life
[1:25:20] can deny the fact of free acts

[1:25:42] life
