[6:12] doors were shut
[6:14] where the disciples were assembled for
[6:16] fear of the jews came jesus and stood in
[6:18] the midst and said unto them peace be
[6:21] unto you

[8:32] on the first day of the week the
[8:34] disciples were gathered in one place
[8:43] the people the the the the believers
[8:46] were fearing the jews the other people

[9:48] god
[10:31] so we see here he was the disciples were
[10:34] closed in a room

[10:43] you know 12 men were
[10:58] let me tell you
[11:10] and walk because you have not yet
[11:19] where by people have bibles on their
[11:21] ipads on their phones they feel that
[11:24] they can go to that to the church with
[11:26] that attorney
[11:42] and you will walk with it on the road
[11:45] you will even go to eat with it to work
[11:49] if you are seated in an office
[11:52] you will put your bible by your side
[11:54] bible
[12:08] because you are not ashamed of jesus
[12:10] christ
[12:12] and so you are not ashamed of this
[12:14] gospel
[12:15] questions amen i mean let me tell you at
[12:18] the moment young men will be filled with
[12:19] the holy ghost

[14:00] the revelation
[14:13] when jesus was with them for three and a
[14:15] half years yes
[14:17] he was revealing himself to them
[14:23] why because he was the one
[14:25] [Music]
[14:26] he was revealing himself to the
[14:28] disciples
[14:31] the revelation of the world brings
[14:33] christ
[14:36] when christ comes christian what does he
[14:39] do
[14:40] he fills you with himself
[14:42] i'll quit i'll put you down hallelujah i
[14:45] mean when jesus christ rose again from
[14:47] the dead yesterday
[14:49] he didn't tell them
[14:51] i'll go and preach the gospel
[14:54] you are ready for because you are the
[14:56] revelation of the world
[14:59] amen hallelujah amen
[15:02] he breathed on them
[15:05] and he said unto them never come back
[15:07] receive you the holy ghost
[15:18] i'd like you to turn to the book of
[15:19] revelation chapter 10.
[15:22] we can begin from revelation chapter
[15:24] five
[15:44] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[15:46] sat on the throne a book written within
[15:48] and on the back side sealed with seven
[15:50] seals
[16:00] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[16:02] with a loud voice
[16:04] who is worthy to open the book and these
[16:07] seals thereof
[16:18] no man in
[16:20] in earth heaven
[16:22] under the earth was able to open the
[16:24] book neither to look their own
[16:27] guru now
[16:34] or
[16:36] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[16:39] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[16:41] judah has prevailed the root of david
[16:44] has prevailed to open the book and lose
[16:46] the seven seals thereof
[16:48] turn
[17:03] of
[17:04] the and of the forbids and in the midst
[17:05] of the elders stood as alarm as it had
[17:08] been slain having seven horns and seven
[17:10] eyes which are the seven spirits of god
[17:13] sent forth into all the earth
[17:36] because no man was found worthy to open
[17:39] and to read the book neither to look
[17:41] their own today
[17:52] and i beheld a law in the midst of the
[17:55] throne and of the phobias and in the
[17:57] midst of
[17:58] the um
[18:01] the elder student alarm as it had been
[18:03] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[18:06] which are the seven spirits of god sent
[18:07] forth into all the earth
[18:51] [Music]
[18:55] means jesus christ
[18:58] is christian do you believe that
[19:00] is the lamb is jesus christ
[19:03] and when was he slain for our sins
[19:07] he was slain for our sins before the
[19:10] foundation of the world
[19:14] meaning uh the penalty for sin was paid
[19:18] before
[19:19] even the foundation of the world
[19:35] why because god had his children
[20:16] jesus was not just a body or just a son
[20:19] of god yes
[20:22] the bible says god was in christ
[20:26] reconciling the world to himself
[20:31] and this is the lamb we see in the
[21:55] hallelujah
[22:10] he had a plan to
[22:23] hallelujah
[22:51] and when his father wanted to bless them
[22:55] you know
[22:57] his heart's crossed
[23:01] and while jacob was there yeah
[23:04] joseph was confused
[23:06] what are you doing
[23:32] and as it were it was trying to show
[23:36] the miracle of the cross
[23:40] this old man
[23:42] did not do it in his own accord
[23:46] it was by nature
[24:15] is
[24:42] the gentiles were able to be
[25:13] [Music]
[25:54] i don't want to offend
[26:16] [Music]
[26:21] and we see in the book of revelation
[26:36] praise
[26:49] and we know that it's jesus christ
[26:52] and in revelation 10.
[26:57] and i saw another mighty angel coming
[26:59] down from heaven close with a cloud and
[27:01] a rainbow was upon his head and his face
[27:04] was as it were the sun under his feet as
[27:06] the pillars of fire
[27:10] okay
[27:17] so
[27:27] [Music]
[27:31] okay and he set his right foot upon the
[27:33] sea and his left foot on the earth
[27:40] and he cried with a lot of voices
[28:11] and i had a voice from heaven saying
[28:13] unto me
[28:28] away
[28:31] hallelujah
[28:33] but verse 7 says
[28:38] but in the days of the voice of the
[28:39] seventh angels
[28:57] praise the name of the lord
[28:59] when jesus christ yes christ who is the
[29:02] lamb
[29:04] the day he died on the cross
[29:08] he paid the price yeah
[29:14] [Music]
[29:39] and he finished it
[29:43] now
[29:44] we
[29:46] are
[29:46] children of adam faith to rebound about
[29:49] them because of the way we were born
[29:52] and we were
[30:20] yes he said it is finished you can't but
[30:24] you were dead
[30:25] why right was finished
[30:28] the work of the temple
[30:32] hallelujah
[30:44] was supposed to be redeemed by them
[31:42] the devil should not overcome us
[31:44] santorina
[31:53] [Music]
[31:58] praise the name of the lord
[32:00] if the true church will know who she is
[32:08] the devil will not overcome
[32:09] it
[32:12] i want you to think about that for a
[32:14] moment
[32:16] think about that for a moment
[32:19] if you know who you are
[32:22] oh i'm not redeemed just
[32:24] i'm redeemed all the way back before the
[32:26] fall oh
[32:36] is
[32:54] way christian is all about claiming our
[32:56] rights
[33:00] when jesus christ died yesterday i want
[33:03] to announce to you that you paid the
[33:04] price
[33:07] and there are for now we are redeemed
[33:20] [Music]
[33:23] and jesus
[33:24] yes you when he rose from the dead
[33:29] what was the first words
[33:33] he came to them
[33:35] i said peace
[33:51] [Applause]
[34:02] he was announcing to them
[34:16] is there a time for them to arise and
[34:18] shine
[35:03] that which you redeemed
[35:05] to go free children
[35:07] and when does that happen
[35:09] but in the days of the voice of the
[35:10] seventh angel
[35:12] when it shall begin to sound
[35:14] full
[35:29] finishes that way
[35:35] do you believe that
[35:37] he says you will finish the mission
[35:41] not open the book secretly
[35:55] [Music]
[36:24] that which
[36:35] when he meets another one shalom other
[36:37] words
[36:38] good
[37:07] go with you
[37:08] good morning
[37:10] how do you do it
[37:11] it's a breaking day
[37:13] look at the canister it's darkness upon
[37:15] the people
[37:17] but it's good morning to the church
[37:20] is appearing
[37:22] [Music]
[37:49] we have reached a season of rejoicing
[37:52] [Music]
[37:57] hallelujah if it is revealed to you it
[37:59] isn't new to you
[38:02] hallelujah amen and when jesus christ
[38:04] state that yes
[38:07] in a few days
[38:10] sometimes you say something you feel
[38:12] like you want to go back to it and
[38:14] get into its depth
[38:31] the words
[38:36] we have already had at full obedience
[38:37] with the full word of god and titles
[38:39] asked for the token
[38:41] [Music]
[38:44] that you're not
[38:58] and they waited everybody in the leader
[39:01] faithfully no way him
[39:04] you remember the question i read for you
[39:06] last time before i went someone asked a
[39:08] brother he said how do i receive the
[39:10] holy spirit
[39:24] in the name of jesus christ
[39:31] it was a promise
[39:34] it was a promise
[39:35] that was to them
[39:37] and for their children and to them that
[39:39] we are far away as men as
[39:45] [Music]
[39:48] these people we are asking of how to
[39:51] receive the holy spirit
[40:08] they had
[40:10] already been convinced it was an
[40:12] experience that they wanted
[40:18] faith plays a huge part because when you
[40:20] come to god
[40:22] you must believe that he is
[40:24] oh cook
[40:28] oh you know
[40:30] not that he was oh he might be someday
[40:35] you must believe
[40:48] you cannot receive anything from god
[40:50] except it is by faith
[40:55] hallelujah amen
[40:56] how many believe that you are saved
[41:01] you are saved
[41:03] how many believe that jesus said
[41:19] as if it's the same question but it's a
[41:20] difference
[41:23] do you believe that jesus can save for
[41:26] cooking
[41:26] [Music]
[41:28] it's not the same as you believing that
[41:30] he is your savior
[41:43] but it is believing that he is your
[41:44] savior and that he will save you
[41:59] don't just believe god fills people with
[42:01] the holy ghost
[42:10] you know you can talk about others
[42:14] but you should believe or you know
[42:16] that jesus
[42:17] can fill you with the holy spirit
[42:22] bring it personal to you
[42:26] and you must believe it is god calling
[42:28] you i don't take it
[42:31] for you that he will reward you all that
[42:33] they will give you
[42:36] hallelujah
[42:37] if you intelligently seek him
[42:41] he will reward those who intelligently
[42:43] sick
[42:46] he will give you the holy ghost
[42:51] for he said blessed are they that hang
[42:53] and thus for righteousness for they
[42:54] shall be filled
[43:02] [Music]
[43:03] [Applause]
[43:24] i think
[43:25] those are that that would be the
[43:26] greatest prayer yeah
[43:34] can god fill the children with the
[43:35] holocaust
[43:38] can
[43:52] if you then look 11-3 it says if you
[43:55] then who know how to give gold gifts
[43:57] your children how much more will your
[43:58] heavenly father give the holy spirit to
[44:00] those who ask
[44:06] [Music]
[44:17] [Music]
[44:29] god cannot
[44:31] feel a vessel still filled with sin
[44:34] catholic
[44:38] [Music]
[44:41] he will not dwell in you when you are
[44:43] still filled with your habits
[44:48] are you hearing me he will not dwell in
[44:51] you
[44:53] when you are still filled with your
[44:55] habits go check your name
[45:02] habits are evil spirits
[45:08] they're demons museum
[45:11] evil spirits museum emir maybe
[45:14] so they must be laid on the altar and
[45:16] you must die out to your sins and they
[45:18] see nature
[45:25] they must die on the out of south
[45:27] sacrifices
[45:32] is important that you not only repent
[45:34] but you accept god's pattern
[45:42] of your sins
[45:44] you must realize that no sin is too
[45:47] great that god's blood will not cleanse
[45:49] hallelujah
[45:57] how can i receive the holy ghost i'm
[45:58] telling
[46:26] and be
[46:55] get a sign oh god if you're forgiving me
[46:56] do this
[47:04] you don't need to put god to a test
[47:23] attitude stands in your way of receiving
[47:25] the holy ghost
[47:32] i want you to know
[47:34] that the moment you come to the lord
[48:18] it can never be
[48:31] to accept what he has done for you okay
[49:00] that no sin is too great if any children
[49:04] know that god's blood will not clean him
[49:06] up
[49:08] you don't you don't understand this
[49:11] i don't know how much of that roman
[49:13] idiot i don't know how much sin i've
[49:28] tell what
[49:47] [Applause]
[50:24] is
[51:05] would
[51:06] go come to him
[51:10] you accept
[51:13] his forgiveness
[51:17] with a true revelation of god his
[51:18] willingness now listen listen
[51:20] some people don't know that they have
[51:21] the holy ghost because they are thought
[51:23] wrong
[51:29] they don't have the holy ghost because
[51:30] they're told
[52:16] that
[52:36] [Applause]
[52:48] [Music]
[52:57] you think because you did it you are
[52:59] part of it and it is a part of you oh
[53:00] there was a comment
[53:04] and you could even stay in church
[53:08] but when you have never forgiven
[53:09] yourself name that away
[53:12] even when you go to prayer never get no
[53:14] server
[53:16] instead of praying
[53:17] people think you're praying
[53:19] but you're really talking to yourself
[53:24] you even think that god can hear my
[53:26] prayers
[53:54] hallelujah amen so i'm here today to
[53:56] preach to you you are not enough in that
[53:58] journey and to tell you
[54:00] you don't need to preach yourself no
[54:01] more don't tell me
[54:04] if you have repented of something
[54:06] into your name
[54:08] of jesus
[54:10] [Music]
[54:17] christ
[54:19] set you on a new course
[54:36] hallelujah
[55:05] he will not withhold the holy spirit
[55:07] from you
[55:12] do it and say what you could be
[55:16] hallelujah yielding to the spirit is now
