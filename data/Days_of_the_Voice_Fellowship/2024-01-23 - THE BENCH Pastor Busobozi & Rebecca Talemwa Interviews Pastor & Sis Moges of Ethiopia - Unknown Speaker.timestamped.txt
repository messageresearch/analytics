[0:10] yes praise the
[0:12] lord we are happy to be here
[0:16] uh on this interview with our
[0:19] precious uh pastor morgus and his wife
[0:23] but before we we start we would like to
[0:26] just read a little portion of our
[0:28] scripture here this inter is going to be
[0:30] mainly on
[0:32] marriage uh just to help out our young
[0:35] people and give them a testimony on how
[0:39] we believe a perfect marriage should go
[0:41] because we believe that there is like a
[0:45] that a perfect marriage an example of
[0:47] what perfect marriage should be like in
[0:51] the Book of Proverbs chapter 18 verse 22
[0:54] says who so findeth a wife findeth a
[0:58] good thing and obtaineth favor of the
[1:02] Lord and by the bam in the message my
[1:05] life story 1959 he says so but now a
[1:08] good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown
[1:12] she should be honored my mother's a
[1:14] woman my wife is and they are lovely and
[1:17] I've got thousands of Christian
[1:19] Christian sisters who I highly respect
[1:22] he says but if they can respect what
[1:25] what God made them a motherhood and a
[1:28] real queen that's all right she's one of
[1:31] the best things that God could give a
[1:33] man was a wife besides salvation a wife
[1:38] is the best thing if she's a good wife
[1:41] but if she isn't Solomon said a good
[1:44] woman is a jewel in a man's
[1:47] crown and um oh no one is and that is
[1:51] right it's the worst thing could happen
[1:53] if she is not so we see that uh what I
[1:56] wanted you to see there is that uh
[1:58] beside salvation a wife is the best
[2:01] thing that God could give a man and in
[2:05] Proverbs as we saw he says that a man
[2:07] obtaineth favor of the Lord if he find
[2:10] it a good way and so uh we are here to
[2:13] just give a little testimony for just a

[4:23] still answers prayer so may what we
[4:26] speak be what God will put in our hearts
[4:28] that it can
[4:30] the young people who want to pursue this
[4:32] journey this blessed
[4:34] Journey U and be
[4:36] blessed amen uh we we have a lot to say
[4:39] to you today we have a lot of
[4:41] testimonies they have a lot of
[4:43] testimonies but we do not have time uh
[4:46] it's um they've been quite busy in
[4:48] Uganda I know you've been here for
[4:50] almost two weeks now and uh after this
[4:54] interview they just rush into the
[4:56] airport fly out of Uganda and so but
[4:59] we're just stealing a few minutes of
[5:01] their time their valuable time for them
[5:03] to be able to share their testimony with
[5:05] us so because of that we just straight
[5:07] away go to the questions but before we
[5:09] we do that uh I know that in the message
[5:12] this is really meant for the young
[5:14] people in the message because in the
[5:16] message we have an issue where many
[5:18] young people have come to a place where
[5:21] they think or they feel that the message
[5:23] is constraining them and it is difficult
[5:26] and it is impossible for them to you
[5:28] know find lifetime partn or find a wife
[5:30] or find a husband and some of them have
[5:32] opted to doing what we call
[5:35] PCM or or that is preach convert marry
[5:38] they want to go out and preach to
[5:40] somebody and then convert them and then
[5:41] marry them so really these people come
[5:43] into the message not because of their
[5:46] faith but because they have been a
[5:49] promised marriage and so they don't they
[5:50] don't come in on the right basis but we
[5:52] know that the message is what is
[5:54] preparing us for the coming of the Lord
[5:56] and so we know that's our purpose uh and
[5:58] before we go to to um uh to the
[6:02] questions on marriage and how this
[6:05] happened I know that people would also
[6:06] be interested to know how you uh just
[6:10] briefly don't go into a lot of detail uh
[6:12] how long you've been in the message and
[6:14] how you came into the message and what
[6:15] this message means to you both of you if
[6:18] you feel to just answer I know there are
[6:20] three questions and there are quite many
[6:21] but just uh get that people would be
[6:25] blessed by that as well well uh myself
[6:28] um
[6:30] I come from uh family religion I was
[6:34] Orthodox that family that that religion
[6:37] was just a family religion we knew it uh
[6:40] from family and we were born in it and
[6:43] uh but when I came to uh the knowledge
[6:46] of the word and salvation of my soul uh
[6:50] and embracing this message it's been now
[6:53] about it's going to be 11 years it's
[6:57] heading to be 11 years and I've been in
[7:00] the message for I can say 11 years uh
[7:03] from that time the Lord Has Done many
[7:06] things in my life he has converted me I
[7:09] know our Prophet would say after
[7:13] conversion there is experience
[7:16] conversion brings experience with the
[7:19] Lord himself so after I believed I know
[7:22] I've had a lot of experience with a lord
[7:24] in different places and at different
[7:27] times and um from that
[7:30] uh when I believed little did I know
[7:32] that I would be a minister of this
[7:34] Gospel of this message but when the Lord
[7:38] calls into it I just accepted the
[7:40] leadership of the holy spirit amen
[7:43] sister Mary just a little bit briefly
[7:45] how you came into the message and how
[7:47] long you've been in the message and what
[7:49] it means to
[7:50] you oh for me um it happens that I was
[7:54] actually born in the crowle of the
[7:56] message like we say both my parents were
[7:58] already had believed the message in the
[8:01] 1970s my background is actually from the
[8:03] Kenyan origin and uh when they believed
[8:07] I'm the Third born in my family but
[8:11] uh when I was young the message was not
[8:14] so treasured for me until about when I
[8:18] was about 20 24 25 is really when I
[8:22] began to really see that it's it's just
[8:25] not the message of a
[8:28] man something personal with the Lord
[8:30] It's the voice of God to me and I took
[8:34] it as that and from that time my life
[8:37] completely transformed and uh the
[8:40] ministry that God even put us under he
[8:42] called Pastor VI Cabell in Kenya it
[8:45] really grounded me and that is where I
[8:47] started receiving my
[8:50] conversion so if I can count from that
[8:52] time is almost about maybe 15 16 years I
[8:55] think so you you had an experience with
[8:58] God yes I did and uh no wonder he say
[9:02] that conversion brings an experience
[9:04] correct and uh so that is the beginning
[9:07] of God working in your life that was
[9:08] actually the beginning when I went to
[9:11] the miss church with pastor we how old
[9:13] were you then I was
[9:15] about
[9:17] 27 I think 27 yes and did marriage cross
[9:21] your mind at that time actually I was
[9:22] not even going for marriage it was
[9:25] actually it was so Supernatural how we
[9:27] when went to that church I've been
[9:29] speaking to my sister for several years
[9:32] we should go to moranga road but we knew
[9:34] in Kenya the town moranga is quite far
[9:36] from the city so we didn't hit the call
[9:39] but one day God brought a brother and he
[9:41] told us no it's just within the city so
[9:43] he told us like on a Sunday next Sunday
[9:45] we were inting this church so God
[9:47] supernaturally leads you to this church
[9:50] supernaturally and there you were raised
[9:52] and there you are raised
[9:54] spiritually so spiritually we were
[9:56] raised so spiritually the foundation of
[9:58] the message is right the concept of the
[10:00] message is right the experience is right
[10:03] how they present the Holy Ghost to you
[10:05] how they present the reality it's a
[10:07] personal relationship and a personal
[10:09] walk with the Lord Jesus Christ it
[10:10] really sank in me and uh once the Lord
[10:13] started working with me I started also
[10:16] working with the children so for me it
[10:20] was so complete I was not looking for
[10:22] anything else so now uh did you during
[10:25] this whole time of course 27 is a
[10:28] marital age about did you pray sometimes
[10:31] about marriage and maybe about your
[10:33] lifetime partner did you ever dream
[10:36] about it did you ever desire it when I
[10:40] when I when I got to the card in Pastor
[10:42] W's church I actually started putting it
[10:45] before the Lord and presenting it to the
[10:47] Lord because I felt that this was the
[10:49] right time for me to get married so I
[10:53] was just presenting it sincerely to the
[10:55] Lord but what I told the Lord
[10:57] is I'm really trusting in you if I go by
[11:00] my eyes I'll make a very bad mistake but
[11:03] what I'll do I'll trust you and I
[11:05] remember specific words I was telling
[11:07] him is uh I want to see what's your
[11:10] choice for me because you are the one
[11:12] that gave adam Eve you knew how tall
[11:16] she's supposed to be you knew everything
[11:17] how Eve is supposed to be for Adam and I
[11:20] rested on that so I told the Lord I'll
[11:23] wait for you and I want to see what
[11:25] you're going to choose for me let me see
[11:27] your choice amen so the whole time you
[11:30] waited upon God Faithfully yes I did I
[11:32] wasn't even looking Pastor W church is a
[11:34] very big church in Kenya but I wasn't
[11:38] looking because I had told him I'll wait
[11:41] for you let me see how you going to
[11:42] choose for me yeah and so because in
[11:45] this generation pastor morus we have a
[11:47] lot of young people especially sisters
[11:50] that have started proposing to brothers
[11:53] and others preempt them you know they
[11:54] give their contacts brother please let
[11:57] us be in touch and they they really try
[11:59] hard especially when they see someone
[12:01] who they think is right for them others
[12:02] even tell them these days I love you
[12:04] imagine a sister proposing to a brother
[12:08] saying that I love you but the whole
[12:09] time the sister Faithfully served God
[12:11] and waited because we believe that's
[12:13] what our Prophet has told us that a
[12:15] woman should pray and wait and this is
[12:19] what sister Mari did the whole time and
[12:22] so then while she's waiting and praying
[12:24] praying and so God leads us to Ethiopia
[12:27] myself and my wife and I'm glad that
[12:29] she's with me here today and uh it's a
[12:32] long story but maybe to make it short
[12:34] before we uh we begin interviewing
[12:36] pastor morgas and how they arrived here
[12:39] then in Ethiopia at a time we we we
[12:42] moved there with my wife and God does a
[12:44] work there and several people
[12:46] believe
[12:48] now we we we were laboring at that time
[12:52] and this is very significant because
[12:54] it's really the the the root of this
[12:57] whole testimony
[13:00] uh we have only a a handful of of people
[13:02] in the church say about 15 20 in the
[13:06] church and and these are all young
[13:08] people and they're new to the message
[13:11] and the message is new in the entire
[13:12] country of Ethiopia at that time and uh
[13:16] these are not married I think we we do
[13:17] not have any person who was married one
[13:20] couple joined us who were married but
[13:22] others came in as young people and most
[13:25] of them are feeling incom incompatible
[13:27] to one another
[13:29] but then one
[13:31] time uh I'm I'm I'm I'm ministering and
[13:37] uh I was fed with um you know I read a
[13:41] quote where by bam says that under no
[13:44] circumstance these people talk about 20
[13:47] 25 people in a country where you have
[13:50] more than a 100 million people and these
[13:53] are the only Believers in the country
[13:56] and you have to preach that so I prayed
[13:59] really I I wrestled with God I said
[14:01] should I really preach this or I
[14:03] shouldn't I really prayed and then I
[14:05] tried to inquire from a few friends of
[14:07] mine everybody had their opinion but I
[14:09] said to myself I'm going to take what
[14:11] the word says and if God cannot be able
[14:13] to stand behind that word then he's not
[14:16] God but I know he's God and he will be
[14:18] able to back up his word so I preached
[14:20] it anyhow and this is just goes out to
[14:24] encourage the young people uh who hears
[14:27] the pastors you know preaching this
[14:29] because we've done that even even we've
[14:30] done that at dvf here and many young
[14:32] people are offended at that say how can
[14:34] you say under no circumstance should a a
[14:37] Believer M an unbeliever maybe I have a
[14:38] girlfriend there and maybe they're not
[14:40] Believers but they are good people in
[14:42] the church there are no believers they
[14:44] not there is no one to marry but listen
[14:47] I want you to watch this by the time you
[14:48] finish this testimony you will know that
[14:51] God is God and God will always stay with
[14:54] his word and God will only honor one
[14:56] thing he will not honor a man but he
[14:58] will hor honor his word and if any man
[15:01] or any woman honors God's word God will
[15:03] honor them and so I preached it anyhow
[15:06] and um you know it was very hard on the
[15:09] young people that were in the church and
[15:10] the Believers that were in the church
[15:12] because most of them were not married
[15:13] and they were not seeing any other
[15:15] believers elsewhere in the country to
[15:16] get married to but um so lo and behold
[15:20] we just continued and and
[15:24] uh trying to find where to uh bring in
[15:27] my wife then so that she can speak this
[15:29] portion because we don't have much time
[15:32] and we we we want to just go straight
[15:33] away to the uh to the testimony of the
[15:35] of of Pastor morus and his wife and so
[15:39] one time I'm in the church and and uh we
[15:41] are having um a a wedding our first
[15:45] wedding and uh during that time of the
[15:48] first
[15:49] wedding
[15:51] uh the the several people come even from
[15:55] Kenya and uh I remember that uh when we
[15:59] saw Sister conister Sister Mari was
[16:01] among the group that came from Kenya and
[16:04] we we did not know her myself I did not
[16:07] know her my wife did not know her but
[16:09] our precious brother Paul who had been
[16:12] my coworker in the ministry in Ethiopia
[16:14] during the mission trips at that time
[16:16] was always coming with us from Nairobi
[16:18] and so because of him and and the
[16:20] connection with with Nairobi the Saints
[16:22] in aabi came and were part of the of the
[16:25] wedding there and so when we saw her I
[16:28] think you were the first to say
[16:29] something to her was I was was it myself
[16:31] or was it
[16:34] you I think I was the first what did you
[16:36] say do you remember what you
[16:39] say yeah this girl was she loved the
[16:43] Lord and looked to be sweet she
[16:50] was and here we Hadas our son who was
[16:53] not married I think God revealed
[16:56] something to me so and I always wanted
[17:00] the best for him because of the ministry
[17:03] we we thought God had a big plan
[17:07] for by that time but he had he was not
[17:11] yet married so when I saw this sister I
[17:14] loved her and I blamed her I said sister
[17:19] you
[17:20] here having morus in mind and she
[17:24] answered me
[17:27] amen
[17:29] yeah so uh she I don't know whether
[17:32] people are hearing your sound my wife
[17:33] has a very sweet Sound small sound so
[17:36] she was saying that uh she looked at at
[17:39] her and said we claim you here and she
[17:41] said amen I loved her faith too when I
[17:44] heard her say Amen they were walking
[17:46] behind me actually I remember I turned
[17:48] and I said yes sister we claim you here
[17:50] she again said
[17:52] amen and so uh I don't know what was
[17:55] going through your mind at that time
[17:57] sister m
[17:59] actually nothing I was very excited to
[18:01] be in Ethiopia maybe if I can just say a
[18:03] little bit of how I came first so Pastor
[18:08] wickliff announced that one of the
[18:09] Believers is getting married in Ethiopia
[18:12] if anybody in the congregation would
[18:13] want to go and honor their wedding it
[18:16] will be on Saturday so because I didn't
[18:18] know the couple in my mind I knew I'm
[18:20] not going so come that Wednesday my
[18:23] sister Sarah asked me my big sister our
[18:25] firstborn she she told me Mery why don't
[18:27] we go for that wedding in Ethiopia I
[18:30] told her we don't even know the couple
[18:32] why should we go so I left the thought
[18:36] on Thursday I somebody sent me 50,000 on
[18:40] my phone it was a jubilee there was a
[18:43] policy I had so they paid me that
[18:45] Thursday I didn't know so I called my
[18:47] sister Sarah Sarah I got some money on
[18:49] the phone and uh I think it can fit she
[18:53] told me check the tickets I check the
[18:56] tickets 25,000 per person
[18:59] exactly for her and for me so I told her
[19:02] okay can we go she said yeah book so we
[19:04] booked Friday we on the air coming but
[19:08] before we at at the airport we said okay
[19:11] because we don't have any other money
[19:13] where do we
[19:15] sleep she remember there's another
[19:17] brother called brother Tim he stays in a
[19:20] in de8 or somewhere so we traced his
[19:23] number from the pastor from his church
[19:25] and he welcomed us he told us we are
[19:27] welcome
[19:29] so we came uh we came and our desire was
[19:34] just to attend the wedding maybe to buy
[19:36] a few Handbags and shoes and go back to
[19:38] our country that was all so what
[19:40] happened really when I when I reached
[19:42] the airport the airport that time was
[19:44] the old airport it was not renovated
[19:47] there was this certain rest and certain
[19:50] peace you know I I cannot explain it but
[19:53] I rested in my heart I've been to
[19:55] several other airports even bigger than
[19:57] what was that that but he didn't give me
[20:00] that and there was just a rest in my
[20:03] heart and I told Sarah Sarah we must
[20:04] come back here if God makes a way for us
[20:06] we must come back in the month of March
[20:09] that was sometime in November I told her
[20:11] March next year we shall come back so
[20:15] immediately after the airport we were
[20:17] driven to church and you know we just
[20:18] came with all the excitement and the
[20:20] happiness we're in a new country we are
[20:22] seeing Believers nothing in the mind
[20:24] really so when you just spoke I always
[20:26] say Amen if it's the word of God you
[20:27] just say Amen you receive yeah because
[20:30] you never know where God can meet you
[20:31] just say amen amen and actually that
[20:33] connects us to the Ethiopian people the
[20:35] Ethiopian people have never been in many
[20:37] countries I've never seen people that
[20:39] receive as the Ethiopian people when you
[20:41] speak when a prophetic utterance goes
[20:43] out or the word of God goes out or
[20:45] whatever an inspiration they will catch
[20:46] it amen they just say it with a lot of
[20:49] force and a lot of strength not like
[20:51] amen like weekly they would say it
[20:52] powerfully and well that then before you
[20:56] before before actually that wedding
[20:58] uh we just go back a little bit before
[21:00] that wedding in one of the services uh
[21:05] uh pastor morus at that time had um I
[21:08] think had already been voted in by the
[21:10] church as my associate uh in in the
[21:13] ministry in ad this Ababa and he he also
[21:16] used to be my interpreter so as I was
[21:18] preaching he was interpreting that
[21:20] someon that day and he said I said I was
[21:24] I was speaking on on uh Abraham and uh
[21:28] and um I was just talking about faith
[21:30] and then speaking on Abraham and how
[21:33] Abraham was uh you know told by God to
[21:36] sacrifice his only son and he did not
[21:38] have any hope for for another son but he
[21:42] believed God he just believed God and so
[21:45] what then happened is Abraham just went
[21:48] sacrificed his son but while he was
[21:50] going to kill his son you know the the
[21:53] voice of God spoke out of the
[21:55] thickets out of the sky and he he showed
[21:58] him in the thickets that he said Abraham
[22:00] do not kill your son for here is a lamb
[22:04] and you know he was told to take the
[22:05] lamb instead of his son to sacrifice him
[22:08] so when Abraham raised up his eyes and
[22:11] turned his head and there it was the
[22:13] sacrifice alarm in the thickets and so
[22:17] after the service that day uh uh Pastor
[22:23] moras came to me in the office and he
[22:24] said
[22:25] Hallelujah I said what is
[22:28] Hallelujah I said what is it he said my
[22:32] wife is somewhere and and she's serving
[22:36] God and she's a Believer because you see
[22:40] under no circumstance should unbeliever
[22:42] and she's a Believer and she's somewhere
[22:44] serving God and one day I will lift up
[22:46] my eyes and I will and I will turn my
[22:48] head and I will see her and I said amen
[22:53] you know I also learned to say Amen like
[22:55] the
[22:55] Ethiopians and so I don't know what was
[22:58] going what Revelation did you receive
[22:59] Pastor morus when you said that when
[23:01] after the preaching that day okay maybe
[23:04] Pastor to give a little testimony of
[23:05] myself before that is that um you know
[23:09] as I told you I grew in a family um a
[23:12] socialist family who really don't
[23:15] believe in God or something but believe
[23:17] in hard working and earning and um you
[23:21] know at school almost all grades from
[23:25] elementary up to uh high school or from
[23:29] two uh most of the time I used to I used
[23:33] to stand fast so I a lot of prices and
[23:38] of you know gifts from school so there's
[23:40] a saying that they used to tell us if
[23:44] you approach a girl or a woman you know
[23:47] you lose the vision so you won't make it
[23:51] in life so even before I came to the
[23:53] message that she would Ru your life yeah
[23:55] a woman you know actually later on I
[23:57] learned that that the prophet said there
[23:59] are three things that can ruin a man's
[24:01] life or Ministry number one is I mean
[24:04] one of them is women you see women so um
[24:07] so I used to fear you know before I met
[24:09] her or even before I believ the message
[24:11] I never kept a
[24:13] girlfriend my age is due but I never
[24:15] kept because there's a vision that I
[24:17] needed to attain which which we actually
[24:20] teach and believe yes that we don't
[24:22] believe in keeping girlfriends I believe
[24:24] this is what you're teaching also in
[24:25] your church yeah that's what I teach
[24:27] actually also
[24:28] uh then then now when I came to the
[24:30] message now of course like you are
[24:33] saying I had these things of now at no
[24:35] circumstance that a Believer should
[24:37] marry an unbeliever all those things he
[24:38] really you know when I came to the
[24:40] message I didn't come from different uh
[24:45] churchianity backgrounds I never knew
[24:47] Pentecostals I never knew other
[24:48] denominations even my own religion I
[24:50] only used to keep the the ring the on my
[24:54] neck the cross but I've never gone to
[24:56] church never knew anything so I'm just
[25:00] as I as I as raw as I was that time you
[25:02] see so when I believed um even when I
[25:06] believed the message itself I never
[25:09] knew the seals the church ages and all
[25:12] those Secrets what what tracked my heart
[25:16] is just acts chap
[25:18] 2:38 you know
[25:20] repent yeah you know when Brethren and
[25:24] you know what should we do you know they
[25:26] were pricked in their hearts yeah it
[25:28] pricked me because I found out you know
[25:30] Salvation without Jesus Christ there's
[25:32] no salvation so after I got saved now
[25:37] it's like you know you are writing on a
[25:39] a bear paper whatever you are saying
[25:41] that time it was sinking in my heart in
[25:44] my mind so uh you know when I heard
[25:47] those words of a Believer at no
[25:49] circumstan so I was always you know very
[25:52] conscious of those things so we were few
[25:55] as you said we are few in church and of
[25:57] course there also some sisters then at
[25:59] that time but uh I never uh you know I
[26:03] never told because also I had you know I
[26:06] have to continue my school you know do
[26:08] Masters do phds and all those then I
[26:11] used to think I I will get married after
[26:13] all these things are you know one of the
[26:16] things that this message converted me to
[26:18] is these things can be made you know
[26:20] marriage comes at his own time you know
[26:22] I was converted from that thought also
[26:25] then now uh uh of course we keep hearing
[26:30] the word in the church I was not like a
[26:33] lazy believer that time no every time I
[26:36] come I'm serious whatever is said from
[26:39] the church I go and read you know deepen
[26:42] myself in it because I come from the law
[26:44] school because I'm a reader you know I'm
[26:46] not just coming to church and going back
[26:48] and no I was not you know playing you
[26:51] know it was it was real life you know
[26:54] something real days in life so I took it
[26:56] at that capacity that's why until today
[26:59] when I preach I preach you know you know
[27:02] with fire and with fire and Zeal I don't
[27:05] want meaning I don't like lazy Believers
[27:07] by the way sorry the viewers laziness in
[27:10] the things of God how I really don't
[27:12] appreciate those so that time you know
[27:16] of course we also we had a good time
[27:18] because even the preached the prophet
[27:19] preached that if you're convinced you
[27:21] should be concerned concerned I'm not
[27:22] going to be lazy and relaxed used to now
[27:26] you know I I want to take also this
[27:27] opportunity to say uh it is your wife
[27:30] who saw a vision about me that time I
[27:33] never even used to know even about what
[27:35] is Vision what is prophecy what is
[27:37] prayer all these things I never grew in
[27:39] them so she saw it and she was telling
[27:41] you so I was being approached I was
[27:43] being pulled to the ministry that time
[27:45] so I also you added more that I should
[27:48] be very serious on these things of
[27:50] marriage so I begin to think about those
[27:52] things so it was in my heart that at no
[27:56] circumstance I should should marry an
[27:58] unbeliever and you see Pastor M as you
[28:01] continuing on that note we have a lot of
[28:04] young people in the church especially in
[28:07] the message not only here in our
[28:08] fellowship but in many fellowships
[28:09] around the world that do not actually
[28:11] listen to the councel of their
[28:13] pastors Pastor tells them and they do
[28:16] something else you advise them they do
[28:18] something else but in all my life I have
[28:21] never seen someone that really listen to
[28:24] everything like you yeah because you
[28:27] know I even used to reveal my secrets
[28:30] that time meaning there was a girl that
[28:32] uh we go to school but we never had
[28:35] anything but we just know one another
[28:37] when you grew in grew you know we just
[28:39] used to like communicate like that then
[28:41] I I came and told you there's a I mean a
[28:44] girl we are going to school like that
[28:46] you told me something that I should cut
[28:48] and cut I
[28:51] cut then when I told you that what did
[28:53] you think I you know that time whatever
[28:55] the pastor says I think it is God is
[28:57] saying yeah yeah that's how I take it
[29:00] when I go to church whatever it's being
[29:01] said it's God speaking so I hope young
[29:03] people you are listening I embrace that
[29:06] yeah so I Tred to keep myself even you
[29:09] remember I was very conscious of how to
[29:11] greet other sisters even in the church
[29:13] that time yeah yeah never approached a
[29:15] sister to laugh with or greet like that
[29:18] Pastor morus this generation younger
[29:20] people you tell them they don't listen
[29:22] they go there in their beds they
[29:24] whatsapping they whatsapping they
[29:26] whatsapping and they praying for God to
[29:28] give them the Bible tells us marriage is
[29:30] Honorable honorable and the B and
[29:33] defiled I don't encourage people to
[29:36] defile themselves yeah you know God is
[29:38] not happy you know the Bible Prophet
[29:41] preached a message that God cares do you
[29:43] care yeah know he preached God cares do
[29:46] you care for him you know he wants he
[29:48] expect you at some at some level you see
[29:51] especially this area of relationships so
[29:54] that time you know I used to say of
[29:56] course there are not enough sisters in
[29:57] the church we few about three four uh
[30:00] now I just I don't know I got that an
[30:03] inspiration from where what you
[30:05] preaching on that Abraham that I used to
[30:08] even tell other friends I will never
[30:10] marry but mine I know she is a believer
[30:14] of this message amen she may not be in
[30:17] this church yeah I know she's worshiping
[30:20] God somewhere somewhere that's like a l
[30:23] i mean a moto for me just a it's not a
[30:26] prophecy not inspiration but I'll just
[30:29] say it anyhow I'll get a one day yeah
[30:32] I'll get a one day and actually
[30:34] everybody knew you for that yeah yeah
[30:36] even actually some sisters came and uh
[30:39] uh for this one he somewhere he say he's
[30:43] somewhere but for us we are here no so I
[30:47] as I continued being ready for that
[30:49] marriage and also getting you know as a
[30:52] man you try to keep yourself like you
[30:54] know maintaining you know you just first
[30:57] of all you have to be a man a man like
[31:00] not necessarily materially or
[31:03] economically but you need to be a man
[31:05] properly you don't just wake up and
[31:11] move your appearance you know yeah you
[31:15] appear yourself you you know you have a
[31:17] a
[31:18] proper you know the hair in everything
[31:22] content they calling you you arrange
[31:24] yourself you look like a man responsible
[31:28] responsible so I kept doing that and you
[31:31] see of course that time when another
[31:33] family you know some some some younger
[31:35] men want to look like street gangs and
[31:37] then they they propose to Sisters they
[31:39] refuse them then they say Pastor the
[31:41] sisters are all saying no but the
[31:42] problem is with them no take care of
[31:44] yourself brother is it take care of
[31:46] yourself tell them yeah take care of
[31:48] yourself maintain yourself be
[31:51] responsible you know presentable not
[31:53] comparison but be yourself you see be
[31:56] yourself
[31:57] be humble and uh you know it's not the
[32:01] height it's not the weight it's not
[32:03] nothing you know what you are the
[32:05] character that is in you that attract
[32:08] the
[32:10] sister that time actually I like
[32:14] a this one she was well maintained she's
[32:19] working when had a confidence because I
[32:23] knew
[32:25] I don't
[32:35] that is now her but you God is going to
[32:38] begin another family he's going to raise
[32:41] it expand it multiply it bless it
[32:45] because God is in the in the economy of
[32:47] marriage amen not in the economy of the
[32:50] people behind because they have done
[32:52] their part they have raised the child
[32:54] and you also raised in a way you have ra
[32:57] but now when that happens there God
[33:00] begins to do his work and actually he
[33:03] would do things that he has never do to
[33:05] others amen you know people fear you
[33:08] know because of like you say you
[33:11] backround what they used to teach you
[33:13] how you
[33:17] and get messed
[33:20] up difficult so they have that fear many
[33:22] young men have that fear of even
[33:24] starting of even thinking about it think
[33:27] this testim yeah be
[33:30] yourself be yourself love God trust in
[33:34] God and and actually I have a that
[33:48] always
[33:55] even
[34:12] that the in the way which thou sh go
[34:18] your
[34:19] way the way that God preped for you
[34:25] only I will guide
[34:32] Thee I will guide
[34:34] thee with my
[34:38] eyes he will teach
[34:41] you how to do
[34:43] this even in the ministry even in cor
[34:47] life you may find people criticizing you
[34:50] you may find people despising you you
[34:54] may find different sorts of things but
[34:57] God had a way for you and in that way he
[35:02] will teach
[35:04] you and his eyes will be on the all the
[35:08] time amen so I had this
[35:12] verse in my entire life of this message
[35:16] actually after when after I came to this
[35:18] message I have this scripture whatever I
[35:22] do whatever God leads me to do I do it
[35:24] with all them I do it with all
[35:27] confidence I do it with all my capacity
[35:30] my
[35:30] strength so even that time of course I
[35:34] put
[35:35] uh all these
[35:41] things remember
[35:44] many
[35:55] know
[36:14] actually we know from the prophet
[36:16] Prophet
[36:22] wife whether you ethopian Africa Ghan or
[36:27] Uganda no
[36:29] problem as as talk about white and black
[36:33] you see so as long as she's not a wife
[36:36] and whether you are from Zab you are
[36:39] from Ghana from Uganda whatever it is
[36:42] you have the right as long as and you
[36:45] have prayed about it and you are L and
[36:49] God confirmed to you ask the prophet
[36:51] says different messes is in something
[36:54] will confirm to you in many ways confirm
[36:57] it so I had prayed then after when she
[37:01] came to for that weding I I never
[37:05] thought I would see her that time it was
[37:08] not my expectation but I was open for
[37:11] any leadership of I open I was prep I
[37:14] was I don't know whether from here or
[37:17] outs but whatever she is I be I'll be
[37:20] open I mean I'll be spected so that time
[37:23] she came that time I remember when
[37:27] they ared very
[37:39] for
[37:44] never and
[37:55] very
[38:25] for
[39:25] e
[40:55] e
[41:25] I
[41:55] e
[43:25] s
[43:27] how about now is it
[43:55] fine
[44:23] okay how is the sun now is is it all
[44:25] right
[44:30] is it all
[44:39] right they sound right
[44:43] now praise the
[44:47] Lord are we back
[44:53] on okay so we are really sorry we' been
[44:56] interrupted with some sound
[44:59] issue uh I don't really think it was a
[45:02] technical problem I think it's the devil
[45:04] try to
[45:06] us
[45:08] of issues so
[45:10] now we've been cut short in our time so
[45:14] we we're going to give it about 15 more
[45:15] minutes and then we will uh we'll break
[45:18] we'll break before maybe part B of the
[45:21] testimony if there is any it shall be
[45:23] another time but pastor you were just
[45:26] finalizing uh you were reading for us a
[45:28] scripture and finalizing on that bit so
[45:29] I think we'll just pick it up from there
[45:32] and then uh I always had that in My Mind
[45:37] and Spirit In My Soul so I was
[45:40] already although that time you see as a
[45:44] natural person as a natural man you ask
[45:47] that what do you have in your hands to
[45:50] to get married or to
[45:53] marry you know the people the you you
[45:56] have the car you have a house you have
[45:58] this and you have you all these
[46:01] things so I didn't fulfill that although
[46:04] fulfilling that is also good so uh when
[46:09] she came they came as a group from
[46:11] pastor's Church to attend the wedding
[46:15] they came we were in the wedding on
[46:17] Saturday she was there were all of us
[46:20] enjoing the weding she was jumping all
[46:23] of them all of us were jumping up joing
[46:26] the Lord and now Sunday also in the
[46:28] church now what really amazes me of
[46:33] the that which I was always saying as an
[46:37] inspiration or as any because life and
[46:41] days in the m i whatever I was saying
[46:45] God fulfilled
[46:46] it you see that's the point I want to
[46:49] raise here so Sunday Pastor wky was
[46:54] preaching and I was interpreting for
[46:59] him and the pastor really preached a
[47:01] masterpiece and people are really you
[47:05] know that time was a time really many of
[47:09] us uh you know having a time of
[47:12] reconciliation with the Lord you know a
[47:14] time of it was really the presence of
[47:16] God was too much and that service
[47:19] and then uh the pastor preached I guess
[47:24] he called you to the pulit and you led
[47:26] us through now in prayer more prayers
[47:29] then I was standing on the pulpit and
[47:32] you are praying I'm praying you led us
[47:35] to prayer to pray in ourselves and as we
[47:38] were praying I as I was
[47:41] interpreting I always was seeing her she
[47:43] was SE on the right hand where the
[47:45] sisters SE she was she was saying amen
[47:48] she was saying amen and amen as I
[47:50] interpreted through the service I I
[47:52] noticed her but now at that moment
[47:56] when you were leading us into prayer and
[48:00] we were all praying and I was closing my
[48:01] eyes all of them are closing their eyes
[48:03] were praying that presence of God was
[48:05] very too much and then I was meditating
[48:10] and like that
[48:12] and now you said something to the people
[48:16] when you said something to the
[48:19] people uh I had to interpret for you so
[48:23] I opened my
[48:24] eyes
[48:26] yeah I stood up like this and I begin to
[48:28] interpret for the people and lo and
[48:30] behold I saw her there in front of me by
[48:34] the way she was SE the other side very
[48:36] far away yeah and that statement that I
[48:40] used to say one day when I raise up like
[48:43] this I will see her then I saw her there
[48:47] I just kept quiet I maintained myself
[48:49] never said anything then that service
[48:51] ended we went home but but that moment
[48:55] that moment no something pricked me tell
[48:57] us what exactly happened cuz I have
[48:59] always told that testimony but I never
[49:00] knew what happened you know I was I was
[49:04] shocked you know kind of you know I was
[49:07] shocked kind of the way she also
[49:10] presented herself how she really you
[49:14] know wanted that touch from the Lord and
[49:18] she came to the Altar and when I opened
[49:22] and I saw her there like that
[49:25] sacrificial lamp you know like AB say
[49:28] she was just all over in tears yeah yeah
[49:30] she was also crying yeah something pred
[49:33] my heart and I maintained myself and
[49:36] service ended we went home now I didn't
[49:38] say any I I didn't realize it also we
[49:41] forgot and like a week later I came to
[49:43] you in the office I remember okay
[49:46] brother B Pastor what do you think what
[49:49] was that sister do you know her very
[49:51] well and uh do you know her where did
[49:53] she come from like I thought she came
[49:56] with her elder sister I thought that
[49:57] elder sister is her mother because she
[49:59] she's jumping up and down like you know
[50:02] you know I never and among all of them
[50:05] she looks different she looks ass yeah
[50:08] by the way all of them looked Kenyans
[50:10] but she looked Ethiopians yeah there
[50:12] were 15 out of 15 she never looked among
[50:17] one of them by the way so so that time I
[50:20] came to you ah you said
[50:23] ah you just SM and okay I don't know how
[50:27] also but um we shall um ask brother Paul
[50:32] you said but in that moment I had a time
[50:36] of greeting her I had a time of greeting
[50:39] her I had a time of greeting her but I
[50:42] never asked her her contact I never
[50:44] asked anything I never said anything to
[50:48] her yeah then you I think went ahead and
[50:53] so uh one thing that I really want to
[50:55] highlight light here is the way that
[50:57] really God does things all the way from
[51:00] Kenya how you did not want to come
[51:01] sister Mari during the wedding but
[51:04] somehow you know God puts everything in
[51:07] place and for you to come and then at
[51:09] the wedding that wedding of uh was a
[51:12] wedding of sister yodit you know I I I
[51:15] did the wedding but pastor Pastor wickly
[51:18] also came with the the rest of the group
[51:20] that came from Nairobi Pastor wickle is
[51:21] an
[51:22] elder and uh him to just you know um it
[51:25] was a big sacrifice as a pastor you have
[51:28] to also pray and be led of God who will
[51:31] Minister on your pull pit and so I I
[51:34] really labored on my heart and I felt
[51:36] because at that time Pastor mgus if you
[51:38] remember my pastor brother was there
[51:40] Pastor wickliff was there and other
[51:42] senior Brothers but I was specifically
[51:45] led to ask Pastor wickle to take that
[51:48] Sunday morning service and when that
[51:50] happened you
[51:52] know Pastor morus you tried to describe
[51:55] that atmosphere it was a
[51:57] real marvelous
[51:59] atmosphere s do you remember that
[52:04] time was a beautiful
[52:08] time was a beautiful time the presence
[52:11] of God was so real and we were
[52:15] blessing and and I and I remember when I
[52:19] um when I came I was speechless almost
[52:23] when I came on the pull pit and I did
[52:25] not have an interpreter because you were
[52:26] also messed up in the in the presence of
[52:28] God and I was messed up and everybody
[52:31] was messed up you know I love that mess
[52:33] of the presence of God because that's
[52:35] where the supernatural happens the
[52:37] supernatural takes place in that
[52:40] presence to you young people that are
[52:42] going to watch this or that are watching
[52:43] this right now want to tell you if you
[52:45] want a lifetime partner if you want a
[52:47] real wife a real husband you're going to
[52:50] find them in that presence not on
[52:52] WhatsApp and chitchatting and asking who
[52:54] is who and running after them and coming
[52:57] to church sometimes you run after them
[52:59] you are the one you are the one who
[53:00] knows every sister in the church you
[53:02] cannot find a wife like that it has to
[53:04] be in the presence of God In Prayer when
[53:06] God gives you Revelation you're not
[53:08] going to be trying and you know try how
[53:11] do they call it try and error try and
[53:15] error you try and then doesn't work out
[53:17] okay I'll go to another one you try
[53:18] doesn't work out you go to another you
[53:19] try it is not going to be like that the
[53:21] story will be different when you are in
[53:23] that presence God will give you like he
[53:26] gave Pastor moras oh that testimony just
[53:28] finishes me he always said it remember
[53:31] he has the scripture he quoted for us is
[53:33] in Proverbs
[53:34] 1821 death and life are in the power of
[53:37] the tongue and they that love it shall
[53:40] eat the fruit thereof yes sir and he has
[53:42] his fruit here the fruit of his tongue
[53:45] so if you you say life you will have
[53:48] life if you say I will never marry you
[53:50] will never marry if you say in our
[53:52] family it doesn't happen that way it
[53:54] will never happen you have if you say
[53:56] I'll marry in 10 years that is how it
[53:57] will be but if you say I'm going to
[53:59] marry this year some of you are watching
[54:01] this testimony are going to marry this
[54:02] year if you believe it amen Pastor marus
[54:05] is going to pray for you before he
[54:06] leaves here you are going to receive the
[54:07] same anointing and God will give you
[54:08] Grace to marry this year amen and and if
[54:11] you say it you believe it so shall it be
[54:15] amen and he said it he believed it and
[54:17] at that moment when um uh when the
[54:20] sister came she was messed up the uh
[54:22] brother was messed up and uh and and and
[54:24] now and now he he looked turned his head
[54:28] and he saw her right there just like he
[54:30] had said it you say what is going to
[54:32] happen in your life is going to be
[54:34] exactly like how you prophesied over
[54:38] yourself and so you you you are you are
[54:40] now talking about um so you came to my
[54:44] office and then we we talked it over I
[54:46] also did not know the sister but then
[54:48] the other significant part is you did
[54:49] not take the sister's contact you could
[54:51] have asked it you were a very confident
[54:53] man but you did not why you see I as I
[54:56] told you I always wanted to go as per
[54:59] the ways of God you see at that time God
[55:02] put you there I came to that office I
[55:04] told you and you went ahead and actually
[55:07] I remember even after even you had to
[55:10] find out who the sister is I thought
[55:12] maybe she's a school girl or
[55:15] something but when we asked brother Paul
[55:18] brother Paul said no the sister is not a
[55:20] school girl actually she works you know
[55:22] she's working so so you had
[55:25] then he actually gave us some more
[55:27] background information he said she has
[55:28] been working for over 10 years yeah you
[55:30] see not because she was since she from
[55:34] uh from grade 10 I think she continued
[55:37] to school and work contined school and
[55:39] work together so so um Paul when he gave
[55:43] the information
[55:45] he he told you uh I think he told you to
[55:49] give the contact to you then it is you
[55:53] who gave a contact to me I never asked
[55:57] her yeah it's me or you I I got it
[56:01] someone someone has a more information
[56:03] on that yeah how did he get the contact
[56:06] yeah after praying reading whatever you
[56:09] gave him then you
[56:12] allowed I actually did not have the
[56:15] contact my wife is the one who had the
[56:16] contact I remember the first thing I
[56:18] told you remember the first thing I told
[56:19] you to do read this uh of you know the
[56:22] courtship uh book cour yeah brother Beck
[56:26] is who put that
[56:27] together 100 pages in two nights I
[56:30] finished it
[56:32] because yeah I didn't sleep I remember I
[56:35] used to live in back of you know
[56:37] somewhere you remember how I used to
[56:40] pray every morning this is your will
[56:42] yeah brother and sister this I want to I
[56:45] I just want to inject some word here
[56:48] some inspiration or some thoughts tell
[56:50] them before you decide because marriage
[56:53] we always preach or we always say say
[56:56] once you enter into there is no way
[56:59] out hey there's no trying and coming
[57:03] back out so you marry someone whom you
[57:07] loved you marry someone whom the Lord
[57:11] has confirmed to you you marry someone
[57:16] who you have confidence in you marry you
[57:21] don't marry family you marry the sister
[57:25] you don't marry to the things that are
[57:28] surrounding her you marry character in
[57:30] her actually another Pastor put it this
[57:32] way you marry the character of Christ in
[57:36] her she's a raw material you make her to
[57:39] what you want to be after you grow
[57:43] together
[57:47] yeah okay I wanted to say something
[57:49] about M's life I wish all young people
[57:52] can be like him he didn't give okay like
[57:55] a hard time this morus was someone who
[57:58] could take the word of God serious
[58:00] whenever he was told something he really
[58:02] put it in in in
[58:05] action and he worked upon it it was
[58:08] really working in his life even that one
[58:10] gave me a great burden to pray for M
[58:13] because he was a special brother I wish
[58:16] all of you can take what your pastors
[58:18] teach you for sure yeah that's
[58:21] all amen and from that I I got her
[58:25] contact I told her the first statement
[58:27] said God bless you my sister we I I hope
[58:31] you enjoyed Among Us uh we thank God we
[58:34] had a good time in the presence of the
[58:37] Lord that's I thought wait a moment this
[58:40] is a good moment now young people listen
[58:43] this is not the best moment now it's the
[58:44] climax now okay so you get the contact
[58:47] of sister M after now everything from
[58:50] your side goad my side is settled I've
[58:52] given you a go ahead now you've got you
[58:55] said you go ahead and communicate with
[58:56] her because sincerely as a pastor I
[59:00] cannot talk to the girl on your behalf
[59:03] yeah at that time you had to talk you
[59:05] know
[59:05] some I was I was about not to say it but
[59:09] let me say it some pastors speak on
[59:11] behalf of the boys go to the girls and
[59:14] speak on their behalf but we don't
[59:16] believe in that we believe that we don't
[59:18] believe in matchmaking we believe that a
[59:20] boy has to speak for himself and so we
[59:24] we find that uh when you go to the girl
[59:27] and uh that moment I'm sure the young
[59:30] people watching they will want to know
[59:31] the words you use me I thought you began
[59:33] like this you know I love you so much
[59:36] I'm thinking about you ever since you
[59:37] left
[59:39] here no no no no we even have it still I
[59:43] think she the the chats we had after
[59:46] that about how many pages 600 Pages we
[59:49] we charted about about 600 Pages we
[59:54] charted my God she counted it you have
[59:56] it yeah but the first text I sent her
[59:59] yes God bless you my sister yes thank
[1:00:02] you for coming to
[1:00:04] Ethiopia and I hope you enjoy it and we
[1:00:07] also from this end we really enjoyed
[1:00:10] being with you the presence of God how
[1:00:12] did you find it that's an opening remark
[1:00:14] now now there is some other significant
[1:00:17] thing here so sister M now that's where
[1:00:19] when you come in again mhm when you
[1:00:21] received this text the moment you saw it
[1:00:25] what came to your
[1:00:27] mind the
[1:00:31] microphone I think before the message
[1:00:34] came in uh after we left from the
[1:00:38] wedding what there's one thing that
[1:00:40] striked me apart from the testimony he
[1:00:42] gave about what was happening on the
[1:00:43] presence of God at the
[1:00:45] altar
[1:00:47] um during the wedding during the cake
[1:00:51] ceremony the because the were sisters
[1:00:53] were few so brothers and sisters were
[1:00:55] serving all the guest kicks so morus and
[1:00:58] another brother called brother idck and
[1:01:00] another one came with kicks where the
[1:01:02] Kenyans were so as they serving us kicks
[1:01:05] Mor started giving us his testimony of
[1:01:08] how he met the Lord and how the Lord
[1:01:10] called him from Orthodox religion and
[1:01:12] how God dealt with him and converted
[1:01:14] them how he's embraced this message how
[1:01:16] he was able to sacrifice everything him
[1:01:19] being a lawyer a potential judge in
[1:01:21] Ethiopia you know everybody wants this
[1:01:23] top top position
[1:01:25] like what we fight for in Kenya and this
[1:01:27] young man just he did not count it
[1:01:30] anything he's really like Moses actually
[1:01:32] his name is mes but it's really Moses in
[1:01:35] English just like Moses forsook the
[1:01:37] pleasures of Egypt to be counted with
[1:01:40] the children of God is exactly what he
[1:01:42] did that one really strike me so after
[1:01:45] that service when Pastor wickly was
[1:01:47] preaching I was actually telling the
[1:01:48] Lord Lord if somebody can really Embrace
[1:01:51] this message so much and sacrifice for
[1:01:54] you even their very
[1:01:56] life their very own life counting your
[1:01:58] Treasures of this message as the best
[1:02:01] Treasures that he can have Lord give me
[1:02:03] a faith like that because that time in
[1:02:06] my country I was already working and
[1:02:08] right there in the youth meetings which
[1:02:09] just ended pastor morus preached on
[1:02:11] esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:02:12] esteeming the reproach I believe every
[1:02:14] young person should look that up my my
[1:02:16] it was a masterpiece so that one really
[1:02:18] caught me so we we traveled back home
[1:02:19] and everything no contacts and anything
[1:02:21] I'm not thinking about anything but now
[1:02:24] one in the service in around December
[1:02:29] Pastor wkly was preaching and I'm
[1:02:32] listening the service and just morus
[1:02:35] passes I don't know to call it a TR or
[1:02:38] and I was not thinking about it but
[1:02:40] remember I used to have fervent prayers
[1:02:43] before the Lord concerning my marriage
[1:02:45] because I didn't want to take a wrong
[1:02:46] route and I told the Lord Lord I
[1:02:49] know if I can just lean on your arm
[1:02:51] surely you'll not let me down even I
[1:02:53] told the Lord one word we use in
[1:02:55] procurement because I'm a procurement
[1:02:57] specialist I told him Lord I will let
[1:02:59] you do the due diligence for me you know
[1:03:02] due diligence
[1:03:03] is you know you know that person you
[1:03:06] know what is in their heart what is in
[1:03:07] their soul what is around them how they
[1:03:09] grew who their families are you know
[1:03:11] like it's you do the I told the Lord
[1:03:13] you'll do diligence for me for the
[1:03:16] brother that you want to bless me with
[1:03:19] so that was my prayer and now when when
[1:03:22] I saw him in a or was it a vision I
[1:03:25] don't know so just there I found myself
[1:03:28] saying Lord if there's anything to eat
[1:03:30] you know my number you know where I sit
[1:03:33] in church you know the roads I go to you
[1:03:35] know my email address you can find me
[1:03:37] anywhere and I left it at that the next
[1:03:42] Monday the next Monday at
[1:03:45] 4:30 the message comes to my phone
[1:03:49] greetings and it shocked me did you not
[1:03:52] faint it shocked me because I just
[1:03:54] connected it to the to the what I said
[1:03:58] yesterday in the church okay I responded
[1:04:01] just greetings normally we had a good
[1:04:03] time also the Lord was so gracious
[1:04:04] ethopia what God is doing let him
[1:04:05] continue and that was it
[1:04:10] now would it be correct to say that the
[1:04:13] moment you received that
[1:04:15] message you were 70% sure that brother
[1:04:19] morgus was your husband actually I was
[1:04:22] almost nearing 100 nearly only the only
[1:04:26] because I was in prayer Pastor all this
[1:04:28] time in fact I used to pray at 3:00 a.m.
[1:04:31] every morning and my sisters would come
[1:04:33] in the salon I would leave them in the
[1:04:35] room I go to the salon alone in a small
[1:04:37] M and I would really pray before the
[1:04:38] Lord and um my sister one day she was
[1:04:42] just passing to go to the washrooms and
[1:04:44] she passed by and say Lord whatever this
[1:04:46] girl is praying for just give her give
[1:04:48] her we are tired if it's a husband give
[1:04:52] her whatever she wants just give her
[1:04:54] was my big sister sister s what do you
[1:04:57] have and I think I saw Sarah following
[1:04:59] on on on YouTube so God bless you Sister
[1:05:01] Sarah Mor we are so happy I know she has
[1:05:05] a wedding soon she has a wedding soon
[1:05:07] yes so now Sister Mary tell the young
[1:05:11] people
[1:05:12] following what would you tell them about
[1:05:15] this matter because you received a text
[1:05:20] uh from brother morus at the time and
[1:05:23] you knew already you were almost 100%
[1:05:26] because you you you were praying you the
[1:05:28] whole thing was a spiritual thing it was
[1:05:30] a spiritual Affair so for me it was so
[1:05:32] Supernatural by the way what do you
[1:05:34] advise these young people and before you
[1:05:37] advise them I want to ask you a question
[1:05:39] were you having other brothers you were
[1:05:41] now texting back and forth with tell us
[1:05:43] confess today sister
[1:05:45] M uh for me no that I didn't have any
[1:05:48] other brothers that I was texting
[1:05:49] actually when I went to the Church of
[1:05:51] Pastor wickliff there's a brother that I
[1:05:53] used to like so so much but it was my
[1:05:55] own doing I used to like him so much but
[1:05:58] on the opposite side he was not liking
[1:06:00] me back and it used to make me feel so
[1:06:02] bad so but God was so faithful because
[1:06:06] when you put something before him he
[1:06:07] will answer yeah he would tell me every
[1:06:10] day either in a dream or in the Bible
[1:06:13] That's not the one for you I have the
[1:06:15] one for you he's not the one for you and
[1:06:17] I would fight with God why wouldn't you
[1:06:19] change his heart you are the god you can
[1:06:21] change this is the one I want yeah and
[1:06:23] God would tell me that's not the one it
[1:06:25] was a desire but God had not sanctioned
[1:06:27] he didn't sanction and he would tell me
[1:06:29] when he' show me in dreams he's not the
[1:06:30] one so in other words we believe that
[1:06:32] God can actually speak to you about your
[1:06:34] lifetime partner correct God is faithful
[1:06:37] you're his child and so what do you
[1:06:38] speak to them who are listening that are
[1:06:41] actually right now chitchatting with
[1:06:43] three four of them at the same time Just
[1:06:45] Surrender the day I
[1:06:48] surrendered the lord gave me that song
[1:06:50] called um you whatever it be whatever it
[1:06:53] be thy will is th is mine whatever it be
[1:06:57] thy hand Divine sustain me amen thy will
[1:07:01] let your will be mine whatever it be the
[1:07:05] day the lord gave me that song that was
[1:07:06] it I surrendered I told God from today
[1:07:10] Take the Lead whatever you choose that's
[1:07:12] what I'll take even if he lives in a box
[1:07:14] house you know the prophet talks about a
[1:07:15] box house yeah box house yes a box a
[1:07:17] Caron house yeah I told the Lord even if
[1:07:20] you want me to go and you give me my my
[1:07:23] Adam who lives in a box house with
[1:07:25] nothing I will say yes and I will go and
[1:07:29] friends you need to understand that this
[1:07:30] is somebody who was already
[1:07:33] working uh in a a very in a
[1:07:35] multinational company actually uh
[1:07:38] earning good salary having own property
[1:07:40] and doing quite well not so bad and so
[1:07:44] but she was willing to follow the will
[1:07:46] and the mind of God now if you are
[1:07:49] looking for a lifetime partner you must
[1:07:51] be willing to follow the mind of God not
[1:07:53] your will but the mind of God the will
[1:07:54] of God because God speaks if we are
[1:07:57] talking about a living God Pastor M
[1:07:58] preaching about a living God the the
[1:08:00] other day if we're talking about a
[1:08:01] living God is not dead He's Alive And if
[1:08:04] you you desire to meet him on any matter
[1:08:07] in your life he will show himself to you
[1:08:09] because he's not dead he's alive he's a
[1:08:11] living God him that did it for them can
[1:08:14] and for us as well we only we also have
[1:08:16] our own testimony he that did it for
[1:08:18] them and us can do it for you because
[1:08:20] he's a living God he's not dead we sing
[1:08:22] a song Our God is not dead he is alive
[1:08:26] and so sister if you're chatting with
[1:08:28] three four brothers five 6 10 no you are
[1:08:32] doing a big mistake marage is not like
[1:08:34] that marriage is not like that just tell
[1:08:36] them yeah so I want what I would just
[1:08:40] want to add finally is that
[1:08:43] um okay after choosing then the rest the
[1:08:47] procedures I took it you know as per the
[1:08:51] code and conduct of the mage message you

[1:09:09] reached there he never despised us or he
[1:09:11] never said anything he just said okay
[1:09:13] for me it's okay but you go and finish
[1:09:18] with a parent so even gave us some deons
[1:09:21] from the church like pastor brother in
[1:09:24] boa that time we went there the family
[1:09:26] received us they never gave us a lot of
[1:09:28] trouble so we were at good then

[1:10:04] went on well and everything because when
[1:10:06] Once something once God is in something
[1:10:09] he will accomplish it he will be with
[1:10:11] you he will support you he he will make
[1:10:13] a way where there's no way he will raise
[1:10:15] people and I and I remember and I
[1:10:18] remember before you actually met Pastor
[1:10:21] wickliff my wife and I was going through
[1:10:23] Nairobi we actually took a a Night
[1:10:26] Flight there yeah we arrived and met him
[1:10:28] reminded me that and uh I had to be I to
[1:10:32] be a John Baptist Baptist God used you
[1:10:35] mightily and mightily and mightily
[1:10:37] that's why even the other day here I I
[1:10:39] gave a testimony what you stood for me
[1:10:42] that time I will not forget it my
[1:10:45] generation will not forget it even the
[1:10:47] next so I am so grateful God raed you my
[1:10:50] life in he and also your wife and and I
[1:10:54] always appreciate her uh that she took
[1:10:57] she took me as a child she fed me she
[1:10:59] saw something great in me which I didn't
[1:11:02] know and others didn't see so and so
[1:11:05] when we met the pastor wck he was very
[1:11:07] gracious he was a kind man he received
[1:11:09] us and also this goes to show the young
[1:11:12] people you see Pastor morgus you're now
[1:11:14] a pastor and you are leading not only
[1:11:18] one Fellowship but very many churches in
[1:11:20] Ethiopia and the Lord teres and you know
[1:11:22] there will be very many by thousands of
[1:11:25] Believers and I'm sure that many of them
[1:11:28] will see this testimony in the in the
[1:11:30] coming years if the Lord
[1:11:32] T but this is not only for them but for
[1:11:34] us here and for our young people here
[1:11:36] and for whoever that God will allow this
[1:11:38] testimony to get to our Prophet says
[1:11:41] that uh the man of God that he raises in
[1:11:44] your life is your pastor give him
[1:11:46] respects sure and he says that he will
[1:11:48] lead you through you see but many people
[1:11:51] young people when they want to start
[1:11:52] marriage they are by pass bypassing
[1:11:54] their Pastor no no no you get the
[1:11:56] blessing of your pastor let him bless it
[1:11:59] let him see also because you are also
[1:12:01] taught yeah you know if the sister is in
[1:12:04] the church and the brother is in the
[1:12:07] church the pastor should know the status
[1:12:10] of the sister yeah you first come to the
[1:12:13] pastor yeah the pastor knows her status
[1:12:16] yes whether she is already you know in
[1:12:19] on the process of another person yes or
[1:12:22] not uh or not
[1:12:24] and he would tell you when you reached
[1:12:25] Pastor W and we asked him he said the
[1:12:27] sister is good good yeah as far as I
[1:12:29] know there's no one who is talking to
[1:12:32] her yeah so you go ahead yeah you see if
[1:12:36] you just go to the sister so you had now
[1:12:38] the blessing of her pastor yeah the
[1:12:39] pastor has given you he said she's
[1:12:41] faithful she's good girl she's good
[1:12:43] she's she's you know he will tell you
[1:12:45] about her faith about also her a
[1:12:47] character I mean he would tell you about
[1:12:49] her he said the family is good the
[1:12:51] sister is good so you go ahead you see
[1:12:55] if you just go to direct by passing the
[1:12:57] pastor maybe that
[1:12:59] sister is maybe on the process of
[1:13:02] engaging another brother which the the
[1:13:04] church knows and you are making what
[1:13:06] this this what do you call adulter or
[1:13:08] something you are making something wrong
[1:13:10] you see you are you are doing you know
[1:13:13] you are making her mind also to and and
[1:13:15] many of them you know many of them
[1:13:17] approach it kindly you know you see
[1:13:18] because you see if this brother comes
[1:13:21] this brother is maybe driving a very
[1:13:22] good car and he's well off and this
[1:13:24] brother is just starting out in life and
[1:13:26] the sister is put in a situation where
[1:13:27] she has to compare who should I choose
[1:13:29] no no all these things as I told you
[1:13:31] when okay I want to say these things she
[1:13:34] was much better than I in life at that
[1:13:36] time when I found her later but when I
[1:13:40] saw her first I never knew any of that
[1:13:43] as I told you I thought she's a school
[1:13:44] girl yeah yeah I always said it even
[1:13:47] that time yes even when we communicate
[1:13:51] by the way she used to when you send
[1:13:53] sometimes after everything the church
[1:13:55] pastor and this side known we used to
[1:13:57] communicate every morning so she used to
[1:13:59] we used to call each other video call
[1:14:02] then she hides those Vehicles she's
[1:14:04] driving she didn't want me to be
[1:14:06] stumbled I never knew by the way I never
[1:14:08] think things and I never married these
[1:14:11] things and I I saw Christ in her I even
[1:14:15] from that time by let me tell you this
[1:14:17] as a final from that time it's about six
[1:14:20] years now we never

[1:15:03] Doctrine in the church to preach when

[1:15:32] so there may be some difference on food
[1:15:35] you know how to receive welcome you know
[1:15:37] this and that then we always speak and
[1:15:39] set out things and we're happily living
[1:15:42] together Pastor moras sister mgas I I
[1:15:44] wish we would really continue but uh
[1:15:47] unless I'm going to buy you another
[1:15:49] ticket uh so we have to really Rush
[1:15:51] right now and go to the airport and uh
[1:15:54] and if we miss our flight sister morus
[1:15:56] you will have to buy another ticket by
[1:15:58] yourself so but anyways I know sister
[1:16:00] morus has something to say before before
[1:16:02] we
[1:16:06] go I would wish to really encourage the
[1:16:09] sisters and tell them always the Lord
[1:16:12] works both ways in any marriage the Lord
[1:16:14] works both ways he cannot confirm to
[1:16:17] morus that I'm his wife and he doesn't
[1:16:20] confirm to me so when he sent me that
[1:16:24] message greeting
[1:16:25] me in my spirit I knew but I told the
[1:16:28] Lord you must confirm I must be sure
[1:16:31] because I want to know that I'm walking
[1:16:32] in the path of your will for my life so
[1:16:36] I prayed on later for another two weeks
[1:16:38] I think two weeks almost and uh as we
[1:16:41] continue talking as we continue talking
[1:16:44] when he proposed marriage to me that he
[1:16:46] wants to come and ask my mother for my
[1:16:47] hand in marriage I was in the office he
[1:16:50] just sent me a text he wants to come and
[1:16:51] see my mother and ask for my hand that
[1:16:54] is the day my stomach
[1:16:56] went and I told my boss I need to leave
[1:16:59] just now I'm suddenly sick and I need to
[1:17:01] leave I went straight home in my room
[1:17:04] locked locked I prayed until three I
[1:17:07] told Lord you must confirm to me today
[1:17:10] what is this I'm stepping into what is
[1:17:12] all this that is going on this
[1:17:14] conversations with this brother I want
[1:17:15] to know if it is your will let it be if
[1:17:18] it's not take it away amen I wasn't
[1:17:21] interested in joking amen that was like
[1:17:23] I think after we spoke for almost I
[1:17:26] think a month or so yeah but remember
[1:17:29] yeah no no just said he had finished her
[1:17:33] I finished
[1:17:34] her
[1:17:35] no Al she
[1:17:38] finished yeah she must have finished
[1:17:41] your because oh my God she was all over
[1:17:43] your mind remember that time we were
[1:17:44] together with you how I used to tell you
[1:17:46] I have a burden for Kenya yeah this time
[1:17:49] you you had a burden to go to Kenya to
[1:17:52] serve God but I don't know what kind of
[1:17:53] serving God was this pastor I actually
[1:17:55] think he got finished on Friday when I
[1:17:57] was walking in with the
[1:17:58] suitcases I think that's when he got
[1:18:00] finished he'll tell us the backside of
[1:18:02] the story yeah so so I prayed until
[1:18:06] about 7:00 the Lord was silent he's not
[1:18:08] saying anything I got tired of praying I
[1:18:11] took my Bible I couldn't get any
[1:18:13] Scripture that was ministering to me
[1:18:15] then I opened one
[1:18:17] message I'm telling you this message has
[1:18:19] the answer for everything young people
[1:18:22] don't look for Google answers Google is
[1:18:24] not your father your father is in the
[1:18:27] message the Lord Jesus Christ he has
[1:18:29] answers for everything so I just opened
[1:18:32] one just the way you open like this and
[1:18:35] there was my
[1:18:37] quotation in one message called I will
[1:18:39] restore God clearly said go ahead this
[1:18:42] is my blessing for you I have come to
[1:18:45] kiss you on the cheek it is there in one
[1:18:47] of the messages in I will restore to
[1:18:50] tell you go ahead and I close that
[1:18:52] chapter chapter and the next day I
[1:18:54] called my mother I didn't even involve
[1:18:56] anyone because I wanted first to know it
[1:18:58] is the Lord then from there let me tell
[1:19:00] my mother when I call my mother the
[1:19:02] second day I tell her okay mom there's
[1:19:05] something happening there's this brother
[1:19:06] from ethopia my mom just tells me H so
[1:19:09] it is
[1:19:10] you and I tell her what kind of answer
[1:19:13] is that so it is you yeah you're the one
[1:19:16] God showed me last year in
[1:19:18] 2016 God showed me some funny kind of
[1:19:21] people they look like so
[1:19:23] they were singing around my house like
[1:19:25] this coming to take my girls so as
[1:19:28] December was approaching she started
[1:19:29] asking the Lord Lord did you show me a
[1:19:31] dream which is not true and remember I
[1:19:33] came in November here December from
[1:19:37] December 13th already M has already
[1:19:39] started talking to me but me I don't
[1:19:41] have confirmation from the Lord I'm not
[1:19:42] saying anything my confirmation came 7th
[1:19:45] of January 6th of January so I called
[1:19:47] her on the 7th I told her mom she told
[1:19:50] me so it is you she told me how is I
[1:19:53] said he's a minister he preaches he
[1:19:54] interprets the
[1:19:56] message he told me Mary let me tell you
[1:19:59] one thing if he's a Son of God it is
[1:20:01] enough he just needs to be a Son of God
[1:20:06] and and and he didn't tell me to ask him
[1:20:08] anything or don't ask him where he stays
[1:20:11] don't ask for it if he is a Son of God
[1:20:14] it is enough the rest will and and I
[1:20:17] remember one thing that I really also
[1:20:19] want to highlight here when we came to
[1:20:23] visit her when we came to her she did
[1:20:25] not make anything complicated she stood
[1:20:28] with us she actually you know of course
[1:20:30] your father's is is is late now but all
[1:20:33] your unles were available but she she
[1:20:35] stood almost as a man in the home and
[1:20:38] she said uh she told all the uncles you
[1:20:40] know of course here in Africa we know
[1:20:42] that we have to pay a lot of bright
[1:20:44] price but she said what I asked for what
[1:20:48] I know my son can afford is what Only We
[1:20:52] Shall require him to pay nothing else
[1:20:54] nothing more now in Africa here
[1:20:56] especially here in Black I know
[1:20:58] ethopians you don't think you're in
[1:20:59] Africa but here in Africa that to to us
[1:21:02] is an embarrassment if you don't bring a
[1:21:04] lot of cows but to any civilized
[1:21:07] especially spiritually civilized society
[1:21:10] they know it's not how many things a man
[1:21:12] brings it's what kind of a man is taking
[1:21:15] someone's daughter and that's even why
[1:21:17] brother bham did not ask for cows but
[1:21:20] what did he ask for he said if you have
[1:21:22] the Holy Ghost to George Smith if you
[1:21:24] have the Holy Ghost that's all you need
[1:21:25] to take my daughter and so that also
[1:21:28] goes to parents I think you know if we
[1:21:30] we make life hard for the young people
[1:21:32] starting out in life how do you expect
[1:21:34] them to to to live a life to to get
[1:21:36] married and to to give you grandchildren
[1:21:38] how do you expect them to serve the Lord
[1:21:40] we have not to make it complicated for
[1:21:42] them but we instead have to support them
[1:21:44] instead we have to support them with
[1:21:46] prayers we have to encourage them we
[1:21:48] have to support them with our resources
[1:21:50] to help them start out in life and now
[1:21:52] because their mother your mother
[1:21:55] supported you and you know stood behind
[1:21:57] you the whole thing became a
[1:22:01] success we we really uh wish we have a
[1:22:05] lot to say and my wife was saying
[1:22:06] something do you remember what you
[1:22:07] wanted to say you were saying that they
[1:22:10] followed uh they followed councel and
[1:22:12] you wanted to say something on that do
[1:22:14] you still want
[1:22:19] to wanted to say they followed C
[1:22:22] whenever they canell like they didn't
[1:22:25] like talk in the night many things no
[1:22:29] six
[1:22:30] is six or eight yeah no
[1:22:35] communication these days my idea I don't
[1:22:37] know what is happen to our generation
[1:22:39] but I really trust that this testimony
[1:22:41] is going to impact someone's life and
[1:22:43] that God will help you to just follow
[1:22:47] not only councel but follow the right
[1:22:48] procedures listen to your pastor and I'm
[1:22:52] sure according to what the prophet said
[1:22:53] he will lead you through Pastor mgus I'm
[1:22:55] sure if we can tell you to preach a
[1:22:56] seron now you will go an hour but our
[1:22:59] flight is done you need to pray for the
[1:23:01] young people listening yeah let me just
[1:23:03] pray in one minute many of them want to
[1:23:05] get married many of them are praying
[1:23:06] many of them have done a lot of mess we
[1:23:08] need God to give them Grace we need God
[1:23:10] to uh straighten them out and make it
[1:23:13] happen for them this year sure and uh
[1:23:15] just want to say this and I pray
[1:23:18] actually in our marriage was uh seen by
[1:23:22] many and many supernational things

[1:23:27] Believers many Elders many stood with us
