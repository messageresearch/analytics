Let the spirit of God just give us a refreshing ask him to give you a refreshing. We're just here to worship him. I wonder how many can forget about themselves and concentrate on him. for just a moment before we go to the preaching of the word. This is always a very [music] crucial time. Time of worship because that's when you concentrate on him. That's when you forget about yourself. When you begin to sing and to worship, then his spirit begin to come down in your heart and then you begin to think about him. And then you begin to worship him. When you begin to worship him, then his presence comes. Listen friends, we are not just singing, we worshiping him. And would you just connect to that this morning? If you don't feel his presence, then you can't hear from him. But if you're connected to his presence, then you can hear from him. Some of us, you know, coming from all these ceremonies and music and this all these things, you know, but when you come in his presence, you just want to forget about everything and let his presence come.

Saints, when I say [music] I never know how much &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Think about it while you sing. [music and singing] I never know [music] how much it cost.

Don't think that we are doing it for the sake. [music] The Lord is touching your heart. The Lord is healing you. The Lord is touching you. We are not wasting time. We are in his presence. Oh, the mighty priest. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He's here. I want you to tell me and we sing this song once again that we worship all together all the glory, all the honor and all the praises. Something is happening [music] sisters take the glory. &gt;&gt; We &gt;&gt; [singing and music] [singing] [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Just close your eyes and lift your hands.

Whether it be bound in any form of chain, Lord, I speak [snorts] in the name of Jesus over their lives. Maybe confusion and pain. Lord, you are losing everyone. You are losing everyone. Anyone that is under the sound of our voice, the power of God is coming upon you [music] to lose them. Lose them. Satan I COMMAND IS LOOSE. LET HIM GO LORD JESUS. May you come and minister to us [music] the word of life. [singing] May you open our spiritual mind [music] that we may be able to hear from you. Worthy is your name. [music] &gt;&gt; Worth is your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. We give [music] this service to you now. In Jesus name. Amen. Give the Lord a clap of Amen. We can turn to our Bibles before we we sit down. Thank you musician. &gt;&gt; We are reading Psalms uh Proverbs rather 29. We read this on Sunday. We just read just rehears it. Where [clears throat] there is no vision, the people perish. But he that keepeth the law, happy is he. be seated please. I just want to greet each and every one of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have very many who are not here that I know of. Maybe over 15 that have we left in Toruro and uh I'm seeing a few have made it. Wow. Sister Groot. Where is &gt;&gt; she here this morning? Didn't make it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sister G. That's quite an effort. God bless you. And sister Monica. I expected these ones to be in Toro or somewhere and I expected them to be there. We left them back. But I know there are others who have not made it. The appeal guards are they here? &gt;&gt; Well, they couldn't make make it I think there only one is here. And um so the others um the sister Mary and others &gt;&gt; the you know um brother Emma the net and &gt;&gt; um they were not able to travel but we had a good time with them in Tora yesterday and uh you know the function started a bit late so we could not wait it out to finish. So, but we are glad that we finally made it personally and the team I traveled with of about 8, we arrived past 300 a.m. But we thank God for the trip that he gave us. Thank you for those who have been praying for us. And also um I know that those I've not had a report yet, but I hope and pray that sister Martha it went very well and but I'm yet to hear from the brothers. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So God, you know, it started a bit late there and you know we I was supposed to speak for for an hour but then they gave me only well I also wanted to just take 30 minutes because it was already late. Uh, I just say what I'm saying because they didn't really give me a a short time. I I'm sure even sister wanted me to still do an hour even when it was late. But we just did 30 minutes with an interpreter. That's about 15 minutes. And I can tell you, we packed as much as we could pack in 15 minutes. The Lord really gave us grace and so um we had many saying well thank you we a brother one of ours brother Edson &gt;&gt; minister from the tesso brethren traveled uh drove with his family all the way from you know I don't remember the place but I don't know remember the name of the place but deep in tesso about 5 just to come and interpret for me on that function. So a lot of resources were spent on both our side him and us. But we always say if it is only for one soul then it is worth it then it is worth it. And so um thank you for praying for us sister the family. They're not here with us as well. You know, quite a lot of people traveling during this season. They are in just to be with the church there and the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. And also sister Sarah, we've had she's also not here. She's going to be with the family. I think is it her brother that is getting married? &gt;&gt; And then for sister um uh sister Mary is her also her brother. So quite a lot is going on. And I just also wanted to let you know that we are going to have a visiting minister from New York um this coming week. The Lord willing. Um we'll receive him on Wednesday. and the plan is to take him to Kamoja. We're going to have a very big convention. Uh so they had asked me to come and and take the some meetings. But whenever I'm going up there, I always desire to take, you know, some more ministry with me. So, Pastor Simon Peter Cece is a pastor from New York and York. He's a very wonderful brother, very uh with a very extraordinary ministry. I tell you what, um I'm trying to see if it would be possible to squeeze in a Wednesday evening before he flies out. If that is going to happen, we will announce it. But tentatively, we expect he will speak for us on a Wednesday after Karamoja. But you don't want to miss that news. You will please try your best to be here. So uh if that works out we'll be in Karamoja on on the Friday Thursday Friday the whole day we are traveling and Friday we have meetings then Saturday Sunday about okay I was told about 9,000 people I expected uh but um you know sometimes people someone throws out a number out there. You don't know. Last time I was told about 3,000, but it looked like 4,000. &gt;&gt; So, we don't know maybe you can say between 7 to 9,000 people. This is an entire regional convention. All the believers in Kamoja are coordinated and corporated organized that convention. One thing I love about Kamoja, I always say that is the poorest region in Uganda and the remotest. But in my opinion, I think they are not the poorest. uh because if you notice if you see the things they are able to do one thing that I've seen in Kamoja over the years I've been working with those brothers there is they are not beggars they may not live in a very good you know situation but they're content and they also always support their own meetings Now I was I received brother Guma the brother used to you know to coordinate there he came here this last Wednesday she was helping him to buy some sound equipment [clears throat] and uh you know he was giving me a report they collected more than you can say 45 millions all of them together, the churches to be able to uh you know buy the necessary bulls and goss and buy sound equipment and do whatever it is. So we are not going to give them any money or any support. We're just going to go and you know minister to them. Maybe our part will also be you know the fuel and which is also not small but when I see the sacrifice they have made we really want to also do as much as we can whenever I go to kamoja I don't spend less than 5 million spreading the gospel is not And so I'm requesting that whenever you hear us, you know, going out or doing something, do what you can also on your part. And that's really why we we as Christians pay tithe, those resources go to things like that, just support the word. And so just pray remember to pray for Karamoja missionary convention that the Lord will will just accomplish it. I know there are many other ministers from uh from within also the country will go also myself and pastor Simon will just take a few meetings and the others also will be taking other meetings. So would you remember that in prayer? Amen. And uh also um you know it's the end of the year there's a lot of things as you know meetings happening around this time. So we're going to be having brother Michael coming up. Uh I think some of you have seen him already advertised for the youth convention in of lifeboat. So, you know, I had invited brother Michael uh before he was invited there. And so then now he he he told me, "Well, I'm already coming to Uganda. &gt;&gt; So, I don't think I can make it again in January and then, you know, things happened. You know, we're trying to work on audio translation and other things or the translating the audio, brother Bham. in several languages. So we are working with him on that project and so now it's necessary that he comes back. So then at the same time he got this invitation to come and take that meeting. So I told him well since I had already invited you I can only support your coming so soon. I can only be behind it as long as you take a meeting for us as well. Well, you know, he's I call him a buddy of mine. So, so he he agreed. He said, "Okay, so we'll take a meeting at DVF." So after the the I hope that many of you have already registered and planning to be with the convention at lifeboat. Where do they arrange it at? How many are going? God bless you. God bless you. Those are three people. It cannot be only three. And yet you expect them to also come to ours. younger people put money in these things and we go try you have known these conventions and uh you know you know I'm sure that you'll be blessed if you can so [snorts] um he that weekend of the meeting after it actually maybe I should just say the first Sunday in the year We shall be with brother Michael here. So you don't want to miss that. Just praise God. So can we now go in the word? Amen. Turn to your neighbor. Tell Ask them, "Are you ready for the word?" &gt;&gt; What did they say? &gt;&gt; All right. Okay. I'm happy to see Sister Rachel. &gt;&gt; That's good. You know, when you see a believer struggling, you know, you know they're busy, but they struggle to come and be in church, it is encouraging. I did not expect this young lady here today. Amen. I'm dealing with I've been dealing with this subject that I'm going to talk about today for maybe the next one hour or so. Uh sometimes you you want to finish a thought one goal but other times you feel that you want to give little by little so that people can be able to um um maybe internalize it very well. How many are enjoying this this series? It was not meant to be serious really but u but it has just happened that way and uh so um political maneuvers that obscure the vision and so we've been speaking on the vision and by the way some of you I understand did not understand the announcement on Sunday The announcement on Sunday, the summary of it was saying now we have full ownership of part of the land. Some of you who don't know, not everyone, the majority know, but those few, the young ones who don't know what a title means. If you have a title, it means you have full ownership. You can build if you want. So which means part of the land is already ours. Don't look at me like that. You need to clap for that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So we are and the other piece we are remaining with 95 million shillings. It's been a long journey but I can say in four years it's been God's grace. So um the Lord gave us the vision he will accomplish it. You know God gives you according to your faith. If your faith is small you get small things. faith is big, you get big. Amen. Amen. But our faith is really big. And we are believing that our God is also not small. He's a big God. And so those of you who have not yet come on board, please join a group. Give your little nickels whatever it shall get. When little by little you reach far. &gt;&gt; We have a visttor here. Brother promise. He's been with us the whole of the week to pastor Michael Wing. Stand up and wave to the people. Let them see. God bless you. Amen. So political maneuvers that obscure the vision. And um speaking of the vision, on Sunday we were dealing with uh with the the vision of this age. And we talked about God choosing a season and choosing a person to minister in that season. And he does not choose when God in a season when God wants to speak to the people of that time, he does not choose a party or a sect or a group or an organization. But he chooses one person and people have always been offended by that. SO HOW CAN GOD use one man in the in the entire world and they will ask you IS IT REALISTIC? I ASK you also is it realistic? No, it is NOT REALISTIC. BUT GOD specializes in things thought impossible. And he, you know, the wisdom of men is the foolishness of God. And so when they think that they know too much, that's when where God God's foolishness begin. They they know nothing. They know nothing. And so we see that God always uses one man and he sends him to an entire generation. So when we say generation, we mean world over. He has done it before in the Bible. He used a man called Noah. Do you realize that the world in the days of Noah was probably more populated than our world today? Have you thought about it before that the days of Noah actually had civilization? Do you realize that? The days of Noah had civilization just like our days. maybe even better than our days because they did things that until today we are not able to do to replicate. The great pyramid of Giza and all this. No, no man has been able to replicate that. Brother uh I was fine and then you you made you just made it bad. So try to make it fine again my monitor. So then you see that uh it means that they had a technology and in their civilization which we are yet to arrive at even their population must have been so large. Now God sends one man not to one city, not to one country but to the entire world. He sends him tells him you know Noah I'm giving you a message to the whole world go and tell them to enter the boat. If you want reason, your first QUESTION WOULD BE IF the message of Noah is FOR AN ENTIRE WORLD, THE ENTIRE WORLD, if if they all believe, can they fit into the ark? The answer is no. They all cannot fit. So then the person WHO IS REASONING WILL tell you. So it means it is not true that it is only one man Noah with the answer for our generation. THERE MUST BE OTHERS. YES, THERE WERE OTHERS. BUT NOAH'S ANSWER WAS FROM the mind of God. And regardless of what the OTHER ANSWERS WERE, NOAH WAS THE VISION BEARER for his season. PEOPLE HAD TO BELIEVE HIM TO ESCAPE JUDGMENT. BUT ALSO IT SHOWS YOU GOD NEVER INTENDED TO SAVE everyone in that generation. EVEN IN OUR [screaming] GENERATION, GOD HAS NOT INTENDED TO SAVE EVERYONE. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. SO IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, WALK AWAY SMARTLY. BUT I CAN TELL YOU, EVEN IF I CHASE YOU, IF YOU ARE MEANT TO BELIEVE IT, YOU CANNOT WALK AWAY. WHY? BECAUSE YOU SEE, YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF THAT. THE WORD DOES NOT COME TO SAVE PEOPLE. Let me SAY THAT AGAIN. THE WORD DOES NOT COME TO SAVE PEOPLE. THE WORD COMES FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO REDEEM THE LOST. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. [laughter] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TO REDEEM THE LOST. SO we were lost. WHICH MEANS THERE IS A CERTAIN PLACE WE WERE IN BEFORE. BUT AFTER THE FALL, WE FELL FROM THAT GLORY. SO THE WORD HAS BEEN SENT TO REDEEM US BACK AGAIN TO OUR ORIGINAL PLACE. SO IN EVERY SEASON, GOD NOW SENDS ONE MAN WITH A MESSAGE. AMEN. THAT WILL BE USED TO REMIND THE PEOPLE WHO THEY WERE BEFORE THE FALL. And that message is not for everyone. It is for THE HEALING. IT is for those WHO ARE CHOSEN. ARE YOU THE CHOSEN OF THE LORD? WHEN WERE WE CHOSEN? THE BIBLE SAYS WE WERE CHOSEN [screaming] IN HIM. IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. BECAUSE IF YOU SAY YOU WERE CHOSEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, WHAT WAS there to choose from? Before the FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, WHAT WAS THERE TO CHOOSE FROM? IT'S NOT LIKE GOD saw many people and then he said, "Oh, no. No, IT WASN'T THAT WAY. THERE WAS NOTHING TO CHOOSE FROM. AT A TIME OR A SEASON, THERE WAS ONLY GOD. SO THERE WAS ONLY GOD TO CHOOSE FROM. SO WHEN HE CHOSE YOU, HE CHOSE HIMSELF. That is why we cannot be lost. [screaming] The elect cannot be lost. &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHY YOUR [screaming] WORKS. Now I'm going to say something very strong here. YOUR WORKS CANNOT SAVE YOU. BUT ALSO YOUR WORKS CANNOT DAMN YOU. That is strong. I told you. But that's not for everyone. THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH THAT ARE GOING TO BE ONLY SAVED BY THEIR WORKS. H the BIBLE SAYS BOOKS WERE OPEN AND ANOTHER BOOK WAS OPEN WHICH IS THE BOOK OF LIFE AND YOU KNOW THERE WERE MANY YOUNG AND OLD, POOR AND RICH AND THEY ALL STOOD BEFORE THE THRONE. AND THEN THE BOOKS WERE OPEN AND THEN THEY WERE JUDGED [screaming] ACCORDING TO WHAT is written in THE BOOKS according to their works. BUT THOSE PEOPLE IS SPEAKING ABOUT THERE ARE AND NOT THE BRIDE IS SPEAKING ABOUT THE OTHERS WHO WERE WHO WILL BE SAVED ACCORDING [screaming] to their works. BUT THE BRIDE IS NOT SAVED AT THAT TIME. THE BRIDE WAS ALREADY [screaming] SAVED WAY BEFORE THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. THE BRIDE DOES NOT ACTUALLY COME BEFORE THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. BY THAT TIME, THE BRIDE [screaming] IS ALREADY WITH THE BRIDEGROOM AND THEY ARE THE ONES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD. SO WE WILL JUDGE THE [screaming] WORLD. PRAISE GOD. SO WHY? BECAUSE FOR [screaming] US OUR CASE IS DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY IS OUR CASE DIFFERENT? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS WE ARE A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. WE ARE HOLY [screaming] NATION. WE ARE A PECULIAR PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD [screaming] PECULIAR MEANS? IT MEANS SPECIAL. IT MEANS DIFFERENT. IT MEANS NOT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. HE MEANS THE CHOSEN. SO WE'RE PECULIAR. OURS OUR JUDGMENT. YOU KNOW WHERE IT HAPPENED, BROTHER? OUR JUDGMENT HAPPENED ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. BECAUSE JESUS [screaming] WAS OUR KINSMAN, REDEEMER. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN A BROTHER FELL, &gt;&gt; the law was the law of redemption WAS AMEN. HIS BROTHER WHO IS WORTHY TO REDEEM SHOULD REDEEM. AMEN. [laughter] AMEN. AND WHEN ADAM FELL, SATAN THOUGHT HE HAD FINISHED. HE HAD FINISHED IT. BUT YOU SEE, SATAN IS DUMB. AMEN. SATAN IS A FOOL. YEAH. The Bible says the fool has said in his heart there is no God. SO SATAN IS A FOOL. HE ALWAYS DOUBTED THE POSSIBILITIES AND ABILITIES OF OUR GOD. [screaming] WHEN ADAM FELL, SILENT THOUGHTS, "IT IS FINISHED." BUT HE DID NOT ACTUALLY KNOW THAT GOD HIMSELF CAN ACTUALLY [screaming] BECOME THE BROTHER OF ADAM. HALLELUJAH. SUDDENLY COULD NOT THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY. THAT'S WHY WHEN JESUS CAME ASKING IF [screaming] YOU BE THE SON OF GOD, IF YOU BE THE SON OF GOD. HE SUSPECTED IT BUT HE DOUBTED IT. HE COULDN'T PUT IT IN HIS HEAD THAT [screaming] GOD THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH CAN ACTUALLY BECOME HUMAN CAN PUT ON FLESH AND COME TO DO THE WORK OF REDEMPTION. THERE WAS NO ONE WHO CAN REDEEM THERE IS NO ANGEL WHO CAN REDEEM IT. THERE IS NO MAN WHO CAN REDEEM IT. ONLY HE WAS WORTHY. WHO? GOD HIMSELF. HE PUT ON A BODY OF FLESH. AMEN. AND HE CAME AS A MAN. THAT'S WHY IN PHILIPPIANS 2, THE BIBLE SAYS, "LET THIS MIND BE IN YOU AS ALSO [screaming] IT WAS IN CHRIST. WHO BEING IN THE FORM OF GOD did not rob to be equal with God. You know what HE PUT? HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A FASHION AS A MAN, A FORM OF A SERVANT. HE HUMBLED HIMSELF. GOD IN SIMPLICITY. GOD IN SIMPLICITY. WHAT WAS HE COMING TO DO? HE WAS COMING TO BE A BROTHER. THROUGH THE FIRST ADAM, WE ALL DIE. THROUGH THE SECOND ADAM, we all live. &gt;&gt; AMEN. JESUS IS THE SECOND ADAM. YET DEAR JESUS IS GOD. SO HE WAS A GOOD MAN WHO HAD COME TO FINISH THE WORK OF REDEMPTION. SO HE HAS REDEEMED THE BIBLE SAYS BACK TO HIMSELF. SO WE ARE HIS PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS THERE IS THERE FOR NOW THIS ONE IS FINISHED IS A FINISHED WORK IT'S NOT ABOUT TO [screaming] HAPPEN THERE IS THERE ARE FOR NOW NOW CONDEMNATION TO THEM THAT ARE IN [screaming] CHRIST. WHO ARE THEY? THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE CALLED BY HIS NAME. [screaming] THE ONES WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE NAME OF JESUS IN WATER BAPTISM. AMEN. AMEN. THE ONES WHO HAVE ACCEPTED HIM AS THEIR SAVIOR. THE ONES WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD OF THEIR DAY. There is there for now no condemnation. They have already passed from death to life. Which means listen, these ones are not judged like the others. These ones are judged on the cross because the redeemer. [laughter] ARE YOU HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? THE REDEEMER took their place. HE TOOK THEIR PLACE. SO THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE KILLED. HE DIED. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BEATEN. He was beaten. &gt;&gt; Praise God. BECAUSE IF WE HAD DIED, WE WOULD NOT rise again. BUT BECAUSE HE DIED AND ROSE AGAIN, IT IS AS IF WE ARE ALSO DEAD AND RISEN AGAIN. ROMANS CHAPTER 6. YOU SEE THE BIBLE SAYS WE ARE BURIED IN THE LIKENESS OF HIS DEATH. THEREFORE, WE SHALL ALSO BE IN THE LIKENESS OF HIS RESURRECTION. SO HE BECAME ME THAT I MIGHT BECOME HIM. HE BECAME SIN THAT I MIGHT BECOME THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD. NOT HAVE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD BUT BECOME THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD. Are you HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE BRIDE IS NOT JUDGED BY WHAT SHE HAS DONE OR BY WHAT [screaming] SHE HAS NOT DONE. MEANING YOUR WORKS, YOUR GOOD [screaming] WORKS CANNOT SAVE YOU AND YOUR BAD WORKS CANNOT DAMN YOU. HALLELUJAH. But what do YOU NEED TO DO? YOU JUST NEED TO REALIZE WHO YOU ARE. WHEN YOU REALIZE WHO YOU ARE, [screaming] THEN YOU CANNOT BE BOUND ANYMORE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Then you be YOU YOU THE VISION IS CLEAR IN YOUR SOUL. YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING? DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING, SAINTS? SO I'M NOT HERE STRUGGLING SO HARD TO MAKE IT IN THE RAPTURE. THE RAPTURE QUESTION IS SETTLED. I wish everyone would understand. I feel even language is lacking. I I feel like if you can if you can receive it the way I HAVE something to what WE ARE DOING NOW WE ARE NOT STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT IN THE RAPTURE. NO NO NO NO NO NO. WE ARE NOT STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT IN THE RAPTURE. THAT ONE IS A FINISHED QUESTION. HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU SEE PASTOR DOES THE THING I DO IT DOESN'T MATTER. NO, THE THINGS YOU DO MATTERS. [screaming] HOW? YOU MEAN I'LL BE JUDGED BY THEM? OH, [screaming] YES, YOU WILL BE JUDGED BY THEM. EVERYTHING YOU DO, YOU'LL BE JUDGED BY IT. BUT REMEMBER, NOT JUDGMENT [screaming] UNTO CONDEMNATION. THE BRIDE WILL BE JUDGED. APOSTLE PAUL SAID, AND HE'S ONE OF THE BRIDE MEMBERS. HE SAID, "WE WILL ALL COME [screaming] INTO THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST. BUT THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST IS NOT A WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. DON'T CONFUSE THE TWO. THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT IS A JUDGMENT UNTO CONDEMNATION. They [screaming] will be thrown into hellfire. AND A FEW WILL BE GIVEN LIFE BECAUSE OF THEIR GOOD WORKS. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT SAINTS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO COME TO THAT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. OUR JUDGMENT IS GOING TO BE ON THE ON THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST. AND WHEN IS THAT HAPPENING IS HAPPENING IN THE RAPTURE. IT'S HAPPENING IN THE RAPTURE. IT'S THE VERY FIRST THING TO HAPPEN. CALL IT LIKE A REAL WORLD CEREMONY. AMEN. AMEN. WHERE YOU WILL BE REWARDED. YOU KNOW THE MUSLIMS BELIEVE THAT IDEA. BUT YOU SEE they don't THEY HAVE EVERYTHING MIXED UP. WE ALSO BELIEVE EVERY GOOD THING YOU DO YOU WILL BE REWARDED AND EVERY BAD THING YOU DO YOU WILL BE DEMOTED. BUT THE QUESTION OF ETERNAL LIFE IS NOT A GIVEN THERE. THAT ONE IS A MUST TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE IN CHRIST. SO WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RAPTURE, YOU ARE GOING IN RAPTURE BECAUSE OF [screaming] WHO YOU ARE. THAT IS NOT A QUESTION. SO SHOULD I MIND ABOUT THE THINGS I DO? OH YES, I SHOULD BECAUSE IF I DON'T DO THE RIGHT THINGS, I MAY BE FOUND UP THERE AND THEN INSTEAD OF BECOMING A GENERAL, I MAY BECOME A CORPORAL. SOME OF YOU HAVE DONE A LOT FOR THE LORD. BUT IF YOU DID MANY MANY MANY MORE BAD THINGS, he realize YOU CAN BECOME A PRIVATE. no rank. Yet he did so much FOR THE LORD. SO WE SHOULD WALK IN FEAR. WE SHOULD WALK RIGHT. We should live PEACEABLE WITH ALL MEN. WE SHOULD DO GOOD THINGS, GOOD WORKS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WILL COUNT IN HEAVEN. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IN HEAVEN ALL OF US ARE GOING TO BE EQUAL. NO. SORRY. NO, WE ARE NOT EVEN EQUAL HERE. WHAT IS HERE REFLECTS WHAT IS THERE? THE NATURAL TYPE THE SPIRITUAL. PRAISE GOD. YES SIR. SO EVEN IN HEAVEN WHAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE IS GOING TO BE DETERMINED BY HOW WE LIVED HERE. But the QUESTION OF ETERNAL LIFE, THE QUESTION OF THE RAPTURE, DON'T [screaming] EVER WORRY ABOUT IT. IF YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, I AM PRONOUNCING TO YOU, YOU ARE GOING [screaming] TO THE RAPTURE. CAN YOU SHOUT AMEN? [screaming] THAT IS NOT A QUESTION. SO NEVER LET THE DEVIL EVEN MAKE YOU DOWN. IF YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, you know where you're going. Amen. It's like if you're a wife of somebody but you behave bad, you don't make him happy. You always make his children sad. Everything is not good in the home. YOU YOU STILL REMAIN A WIFE. A GOOD CHRISTIAN will not divorce you. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? HE WILL NOT BUY YOU AS MUCH GIFTS. He will not reward you with as much love, but you ARE STILL HIS WIFE. AND WE HAVE MANY homes and FAMILIES LIKE THAT WHERE PEOPLE are married, but their marriage is dull. There's no joy BECAUSE THE WIFE IS NOT BEING A GOOD WIFE. THE HUSBAND IS NOT BEING A GOOD HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME CHURCH. WE AS THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, HE CANNOT DIVORCE US. BUT YOU KNOW [screaming] WHAT? HE HAD ONE WOMAN WHO he divorced first. HE CAN ONLY DIVORCE YOU [screaming] ON ONE BASIS. IF YOU REJECT HIS WIFE, IF YOU REJECT HIS SEED, THEN HE WILL DIVORCE YOU. WHY? HE WANTS A WIFE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE HIS SEED, TO TAKE HIS WORD AND BRING FORTH FRUITS. [screaming] AMEN. BUT HE THAT REJECTS HIS WORD, THAT HE WILL KICK HER OUT. HE WILL TELL HER, [screaming] "I'M SORRY, YOU ARE NOT A PART OF ME." AND THEN HE WILL TELL THOSE, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE. COME AND BE A PART OF ME. LET US S TOGETHER. HE [screaming] WANTS A WIFE THAT WILL HEAR THE WORD AND RECEIVE THE WORD AND BELIEVE THE WORD. SO IF YOU'RE THE KIND THAT LOVES THE WORD, BELIEVES THE WORD, THEN YOU WILL NEVER BE DIVORCED. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You can't be DIVORCED because you're the bride. YOU ARE HIS WIFE. BUT YOU SEE THE WAY YOU BEHAVE will matter how you will live with him. Amen. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? May God help us we may live worthy of our calling. So see the vision is to go back with him. The vision is to be restored back. And on Sunday we talked about the restoration part. And told you the purpose of this message we are preaching is to be restored back again to the foundation of our fathers. And we talked about how we are going to be restored. And I showed you that God WOULD ALSO SEND ONE MAN LIKE HE DID IN THE DAYS OF NOAH. HE WILL ALSO DO IN OUR DAY AND HE WILL SEND ONE MAN. EVERYBODY SAY ONE MAN, ONE MAN IN OUR GENERATION WITH A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION. HE WOULD HAVE THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH. HIS MINISTRY WOULD BE IN THE POWER AND IN THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH. AND THIS ONE MAN WILL BRING THE SEED WORD and you know IT WILL BE RECORDED ON TAPES AND BOOKS AND DISTRIBUTED ALL OVER THE [screaming] WORLD. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, THERE ARE PEOPLE ALMOST EVERYWHERE WHO HAVE RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE. SOMETIMES YOU GO [screaming] IN PLACES WHERE YOU THINK THEY ARE NOT BELIEVERS OF THIS MESSAGE. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, THEY ARE EVERYWHERE. ON EVERY CONTINENT ON IN EVERY CITY. GOD HAS HIS EAR EVERYWHERE. [screaming] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE MANY THINGS IN COMMON BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL RECEIVED THE SAME MESSAGE. WHETHER THEY ARE WHITE, WHERE THEY BLACK OR THEY ARE YELLOW, YOU WILL FIND THERE ARE WOMEN NOT WEARING PANTS OR TROUSERS. ALL THE WOMEN DON'T DO MAKEUP, white or black. THEY DON'T WEAR EARRINGS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A SIGN OF SLAVERY. SLAVE FOREVER. IT'S IN THE BIBLE. WE KNOW THAT. SO YOU FIND THEIR THEIR HUSBANDS, YOU KNOW, ARE MARRIED TO ONE WIFE. RIGHT? YOU FIND THAT DEACONS ARE NOT MURDERED TWICE OR THRICE, MARRIED ONCE WITH ONE WIFE. THEY ARE WOMEN KNOW THEIR POSITION IN THE FAMILY. THEIR SISTERS, THE WOMEN, THEY DON'T CUT OFF THEIR HAIR. WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN RESTORED BACK [screaming] TO THE BIBLE. PIGEONS, THEY KNOW THAT HAIR IS A WOMAN'S GLORY. SO THEY KEEP THEIR HAIR LONG AND SO THEY ALL KNOW THEY ARE THE BRIDE AND THEY LOVE THE WORD AND THEY ALL BELIEVE IN THE HOLY GHOST AND I RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST AND THE FRUITS OF JESUS is manifesting through them. It doesn't matter where you go, you will find that. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. YOU WILL NOT FIND THEIR WOMEN WEARING IN SKIMPY CLOTHES, MINI SKIRTS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. GO TO INDIA. GO TO AMERICA. YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT TO CHINA ONE TIME, I ARRIVED IN THIS CITY CALLED SHENZEN. And as soon AS I CAME OUT of the train, I SAW COVERING MY EYES. I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH FOR A while you know China is one of those cities with a lot of people countries rather so when I reach there unlike many of the western countries where you even have to ask where are the people [laughter] you know we're used to many people here in Uganda so when you travel TO THE WEST YOU REALIZE WHERE WHERE ARE ALL THE THE PEOPLE ARE SO FEW. BUT IN CHINA, THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. SO YOU WALK INTO THE STREET, YOU HAVE TO I COVERED my eyes until my brother asked me, "Are you having headache? What's wrong with you?" BECAUSE I WAS WALKING LIKE THIS. WHY? BECAUSE EVERYWHERE YOU YOU look bikini bikini bikini bikini BIKINI BIKINI BIKINI, PEOPLE ARE NAKED ON THE STREETS because it is hot. NAKED. OH MY GOD. SAID I'M COMING FROM AFRICA. WE ARE MORE distant than this. EVEN IN THE WORLD THEY DON'T DRESS LIKE THAT. But you see what? &gt;&gt; WHILE I WAS THERE WAITING THEN THIS SISTER CAME FOR ME. &gt;&gt; You know she was riding a bike. Very nice sister. I DID NOT NEED TO ASK ARE YOU A BELIEVER? She couldn't even speak English. But you know she came for me at THE TRAIN STATION. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I SAW HER AND I KNEW SHE'S A BELIEVER BECAUSE OF THE WAY SHE WAS DRESSED. I JUST [screaming] SAW AND I SAID AH GOD BLESS YOU. &gt;&gt; SHE ALSO AUTOMATICALLY KNEW WHY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME SPARE. [screaming] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN WE GO TO THE OTHER LAND, WE WILL be the same as we have the same year. SO THAT'S why you SHOULD ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR SINS FOR THE BLOOD TO COME. And always LOOK AT THE VISION WHERE YOU'RE GOING. AMEN. AMEN. SO NOW WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A MESSAGE AND THIS MESSAGE IS THE SAME MESSAGE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE not converted. THEY WILL ALWAYS TRY TO PERVERT THE MESSAGE you know to try and bring in a doctrine here doctrine there. But I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR DOCTRINE. I AM ONE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN PREACHING THE FULL COUNEL OF THE MESSAGE. THE MESSAGE IS NOT A DOCTRINE. THE MESSAGE IS A LIFE. YOU KNOW THE MESSAGE IS CHRIST. AMEN. Are you getting a point? SO WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE MESSAGE, YOU REALIZE YOUR POSITION. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So a man called William Brham &gt;&gt; happens TO BE THAT PROPHET THAT GOD SAID IN OUR GENERATION. YOU KNOW LIKE JOHN [screaming] HE WAS NOT THAT LIGHT BUT HE WAS SENT TO BEAR WITNESS OF THAT LIGHT. WHAT IS THE LIGHT? JESUS IS THE LIGHT. HE'S THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. HE HAS SHINE IN THE DARKNESS. BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE LOVED THE DARKNESS MORE THAN THE LIGHT. BUT UNTO YOU [screaming] THAT HAVE RECEIVED HIM, WHO JESUS CHRIST I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE HE'S THE LIGHT. UNTO YOU THAT HAVE RECEIVED HIM. TO YOU, HE HAS GIVEN YOU POWER TO BECOME SONS OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; I AM A SON OF GOD. YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAVE REALIZED YOUR [screaming] IDENTITY. SOME OF YOU EVEN HAVE HABITS. MAYBE WHATEVER. LET ME TELL YOU, if this message is revealed to you, you don't mind, don't even put your thoughts on it. LOOK THE VISION. BECAUSE HE HAS REDEEMED you because he's taking you somewhere. That's why I don't believe in taking time of the people reminding them of how bad they are. You know you are fornicators. Stop it. You are drunkard. Stop it. You you you you are what is it? What else? &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THIEF STORY YOU ARE. LOOK, I've come because I know you know I I believe all of you know your darker spot. I don't need TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF you know even the devil knows. Even God knows. So why do you come TO CHURCH? YOU COME TO CHURCH SO YOU CAN really truly be reminded of your true identity. So you can focus on THE VISION BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. YOU WILL REALIZE THESE LITTLE THINGS cannot matter anymore. Why? Because you would have overcome them. Tell your neighbor we are overcoming. We are overcoming. Come on, turn to your neighbor and show THEM WE ARE OVERCOMING. SOME BELIEVERS I DON'T KNOW SAY NO ME I'VE COME TO CHURCH ALONE. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be distracted. My neighbor maybe my neighbor is a sister. What is WRONG WITH YOU? TELL A SISTER I'M OVERCOMING. AMEN. I will SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET. YOU KNOW, some believers don't even believe that sisters and brothers should mix in. We are not Muslims. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not stepping on anyone's tonight. When you come to church, sit where you feel comfortable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't allow the deacon to force you where you don't want. Sit where you feel comfortable. Surely if you are a sincere brother, you cannot sit near a breastfeeding mother. It means you have something wrong with you. Find a place where you are comfortable to hear the word very well. Why would you want to be exactly exactly near brother Mary's WIFE EVERY TIME? SURELY surely there should be a problem. Sit in a place where you're comfortable enough to focus on the word not comfortable enough to mind other things. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A BONUS. So Elijah the prophet we talked about him and how God promised HIM BUT YOU KNOW remember we were talking about a vision and we were trying to talk about Israel how God was dealing with them as a type on how he's dealing with the gentile church. So God sent Moses with with a message that would accomplish what God had envisioned for his people Israel. ALWAYS REMEMBER GOD DEALS WITH ISRAEL AS A NATION while he deals WITH US THE GENTILES AS individuals in the in faith cometh by hearing. HE SAYS, "IF THERE BE ONE WHO IS SPIRITUAL OR A PROPHET AMONG YOU, I the Lord WILL MAKE MYSELF KNOWN UNTO HIM IN visions and so forth. BUT FOR MY SERVANT MOSES, NOT. SO HE SAID, "I SPEAK lip to ear with him." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "DON'T YOU FEAR GOD, SEEING WHAT I'VE CHOSEN THIS MAN?" And Mariam, MIRIAM RATHER, WAS BROKEN OUT WITH LIPOS BECAUSE THESE ONES WERE TRYING TO MOVE POLITICALLY TO MANEUVER AGAINST THE PROPHET OF GOD. AND GOD STRUCK MIRIAM WITH LEPROSY. HE SAID TO EVERYBODY ELSE, I SPEAK. Listen church. When we say GOD USES ONE MAN IN a generation, it does not mean there are not others he's using. That's why we have a you know that kind of spirit THAT HAS CREPT IN SAYING THAT ONLY BROTHER BHAM CAN PREACH and so we play only tapes because brother Bham died more than 50 YEARS AGO. SO WHAT I DECIDE TO DO THEY PLAY TAPES THE SONG LEADER WILL COME AND SONG LEAD brother shalom shalom and then he says let's now welcome our pastor and then they put the table brother but that's not APOSTOLIC THAT'S NOT RIGHT GOD STILL [screaming] USES OTHER MEN ARE YOU hearing me EVEN IN THE DAYS OF BROTHER HE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE PREACHING IN THE TABERNACLE. YOU WILL SAY, WELL, [screaming] OTHERS WERE PREACHING IN HIS ABSENCE. NO, EVEN IN HIS PRESENCE, HE WOULD SIT DOWN. AND OTHER PEOPLE LIKE BROTHER NEVILLE, THE pastor would preach and THEN HE WOULD COME IN THE AFTERNOON AND SAY, "OH MY, I SO ENJOY THAT MESSAGE, BROTHER NEVILLE." AND OUT OF IT I PICKED THIS INSPIRATION. ARE YOU HEARING ME? THAT'S HOW GOD WORKS. THERE ARE MANY OTHER PREACHERS WHO ARE PREACHING. BROTHER ORDAINED MANY PASTORS AND PREACHERS RIGHT NOW TO DO WHAT? TO SERVE TES TO SERVE TES BUT ALSO TO PREACH WHAT IS ON THE TEXT. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Your amens ARE VERY LAZY. YOU BETTER HAVE A VERY GOOD HEALTHY AMEN. You see, I speak lip TO NOW WHEN GOD SENDS OTHERS. He uses them with little gifts here and there like maybe the little I have one of those little gifts. Another preacher somewhere has another little gift. Another pastor has a little gift. Someone else has a vision. Someone has it. BUT YOU SEE, WHEN IT COMES TO A MAJOR PROPHET OF THE AGE, GOD SPEAKS DIRECTLY WITH HIM, sleep [screaming] to ear. NO MAN CAN REPLACE THAT MAN. AND WHEN THE MAN GOES, HIS MESSAGE STILL STANDS because this MAN IS THE VISION BEARER. PRAISE GOD. Now you know why we say brother Bham says and we quote because you need to hear it yourself. Matter of fact, you need to go and read it yourself. Go and read it. Go and listen to it yourself. You cannot be a believer without listening or hearing or reading. You will you you will not grow. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; You need to read and listen and for yourself look at the journey of Israel. You know they depart from Egypt the plagues and you know there were plagues and then God uses their man you see to apply the blood. Only Moses KNEW THIS SECRET. YOU ALWAYS remember everyone had lambs and hs but they couldn't apply it correctly to survive the death in the camp. So because they DIDN'T HAVE WHAT A prophet someone missed it in Egypt. God told Moses, "Tell them to eat bitter habs. Tell them to also You know, kill the lambs, a family a lamb and let them eat it together with bitter habs. Let them finish it. The blood applied the door. I want to ask you a question. The Jews, the Israelites were living in Gan. Were they the only ones with lambs? Were they the only ones with bitter habs? &gt;&gt; Why is it then that all the house of the Egyptians when the age of death came there was death in the camp of the Egyptians. But in the house of the Jews, Israelites, there was no death. Why? Can someone tell me thank you? God bless you because they had a problem in the camp. Amen. So what's the difference? God had whispered to him to [laughter] the lambs. the lambs and the bitter herbs which they had for years. They did not know how to apply these lamps. In it was blood, but they did not know what to do with the blood. For them, they would eat it. Sometimes they would, you know, throw it away because they did not know how to apply. Listen, the denominations have had this Bible for years even before the prophet of this generation came. But they read it. But do you know what? They still baptize babies reading this Bible. They the women are pastors. If we were one of those, I would imagine my wife here in a skimpy, you know, something with longer nails. Believers these days also want their to be long. Let me tell you that this year is coming on you. RUN FOR YOUR [screaming] LIFE. SEE WITH LONGER NAILS, &gt;&gt; painted face, painted lips looks so red. [snorts] Imagine yourself like that. Then you come, praise God. Today, God is going to do something for you. GOD SPOKE to me sister where did he find you and he sent me to you was that God but that's what is happening in Australia why they don't know how to apply the Bible when they read the Bible they cannot see that that's not the place of our sisters you find deacons who are married more than once or twice. Married, divorce, married, divorce and this brother is a deacon because he has money. Why they they they their eyes are blind. But here brothers and sisters like in many places all over the world. You know I always want to add that if you have a visa they may say oh they think they they are the ark of Noah. No we are not. This is just one little place. There are many other big little places and other bigger ones all over the world that preach this message. But you know what? We have a prophet. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them we have a prophet. Tell them we HAVE A PROPHET. WE HAVE A [screaming] PROPHET. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THIS PROPHET HAS HELPED US &gt;&gt; TO KNOW HOW TO [screaming] APPLY THE BLOOD IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE [screaming] READING FROM A CLOSED BOOK. WE ARE READING FROM AN OPEN BOOK. I SAID THE BOOK IS OPEN. THE BOOK IS OPEN. I AM EXCITED ABOUT IT. NOW WE [screaming] KNOW THERE IS NOT TWO OR THREE GODS. THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD AND HIS NAME IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. NOW WE KNOW, [screaming] AMEN, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BAPTIZED IN MUCH WATER IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. [screaming] NOW WE KNOW WE ARE GOING IN THE RAPTURE. NOW WE KNOW WE ARE NOT JUST THE CHURCH. WE ARE THE BRIDE. [screaming] WE ARE THE WIFE OF THE LAMB. REVELATION 19:7. AMEN. THE [screaming] MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB IS COME AND HIS WIFE has made herself ready. I SAY HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE READ THE BIBLE TO US IT IS [screaming] NOT CLOSED to us. It is unopened. Why? Because we HAVE A PROPHET. YOU see that's how we depart from Egypt. They had a prophet. That's the journey. Then they had to cross the Red Sea. The pill of fire positioned itself be beside them to keep the Egyptians away while the Israelites crossed over. ALSO SEE HOW GOD FOUGHT FOR THEM THROUGH THE THEIR VISION. God always vindicates his prophets. Amen. AND PHARAOH CHANGED HIS MIND AND HE CAME HE HAD LET THEM GO BUT NOW HE CAME AT THEM HE PURSUED THEM YOU KNOW BUT MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND I WANT TO show you SOMETHING CHURCH THE PIT OF fire hallelujah this is the part that is MY FAVORITE AT FIRST THE pit of fire was going you know in AHEAD OF BUT WHEN PHARAOH DECIDED TO COME AND PURSUE THEM, you know, don't worry about that spirit or that devil that is pursuing because we have the pit of fire. Hallelujah. Do you have that picture of the pill of fire, brother? We have the pit of fire WITH US. THE PILL of fire IS STILL IN THE CAMP TODAY. AMEN. AND YOU OF FIRE WENT RIGHT BEHIND THEM. THEY [screaming] COULD NOT SEE IT ANYMORE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IN THE PIT OF FIRE, GOD LOOKED AT them like THIS AND HE DESTROYED THEM ONE BY ONE. WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE THE PILL OF FIRE WITH OUR NAKED EYES. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; IS BEHIND US DESTROYING OUR ENEMIES ON OUR BEHALF. GOD IS WITH US. GOD IS IN THE CAMP. THIS WORD IS ANOINTED TO DESTROY OUR ENEMIES. AMEN. And then they reached the wilderness of Shu. It was quite A JOURNEY. THREE DAYS WITHOUT WATER. GOD THROUGH THE MESSENGER. THE WATER WAS BITTER. SO THEY COULDN'T DRINK FOR THREE DAYS. BUT THAT'S WHY GOD SENT A PROPHET BECAUSE PROPHET MOSES CAME OUT AND HE [screaming] TOUCHED THE WATER AND THE WATERS BECAME SWEET. SO I CAN SAY GOD [screaming] THROUGH THEIR PROPHET MESSENGER SWEETENED THE BITTER WATERS OF MARA. [screaming] DO YOU HAVE SOME BITTER WATERS TODAY? AMEN. THE BITTER WATERS IN MY LIFE. HE HAS SUITED FOR ME BY THIS MESSAGE OF YOUR GIVE SOMEONE A HIGH FIVE. SAY AMEN. GLORY. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AMEN. GIVE US MY BITTER WATERS OF MOUTH. AND THEN THEY CAME TO THE place called the wilderness of sin. &gt;&gt; THEY LACKED FOOD DESPITE THEIR COMPLAINTS. GOD THROUGH THEIR MESSENGER. MOSES, YOU KNOW, HE SUPPLIED MANA AND [screaming] LATER ON HE SUPPLIED QUILLS. OH, are you not surprised that even in our days brother in our day we have had spiritual food IN THIS SEASON. LET THEM STARVE BUT WE CANNOT STARVE BECAUSE WE HAVE SPIRITUAL FOOD IN DUE SEASON. IF YOU CAN'T REJOICE BECAUSE OF THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAN MOVE [screaming] YOUR HEART. BUT FOR ME, I AM MOVED BY THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. And then they CAME TO MOUNT SI. GOD THROUGH MOSES CONFIRMS AND ESTABLISHES HIS COVENANT with Israel. He gives them the law, THE WORD TO REFLECT GOD'S WILL ON HOW HE WANTED THEM TO LIVE. THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE IS NOT LAWS. THAT'S GOD'S WILL ON HOW HE WANTS US TO LIVE. That's the word. That's why the Bible says when he came Christ, we are no longer under the school master. For the law was our school master to bring us to Christ. But now that Christ has come, we are no longer under the law. So you see why? Because we have received ANOTHER LAW, the law of faith. When you receive the word, you don't need another law because then he as the Holy Spirit in you reminds you of all things. You know, they made a golden calf and this is one of the occurrence, the first occurrences of their these political maneuvers. You know when God calls a people, if you want to understand the church, see how God really what he has done for them, see where they are going, see where they came from. how they overcame every inch of ground under the leadership of their messenger who apparently is not a perfect one for some reason. Whoever God calls, he makes sure they have some imperfection. Why? It humbles them. Now, let me tell you something, church. If God was to use a man so much without any imperfection, that man can take the glory of God. And God does not share his glory with no man. I was reading the other day of one of the greatest evangelists of the 19th century, faith healer. I don't remember his name. maybe a I don't remember Jako or something like that. I don't remember the name so I'm not sure whether he's one of those but the man healed so many people like held revival meeting but he died from alcohol drunker and you list one by one talk about Moses I'm speaking of here this man was so anointed that he could just touch the water it it becomes sweet. He just rais stick a rock and the water's part and he separates the sea a sea and you know not only that but also formed a road there. Talk about that kind of man. But this is a man who went and did something against the world. He married an unbeliever. He married an unbeliever. Not only that, he had murdered someone. So he's a murderer and he married wrong. But yet is the man THAT GOD HAD CHOSEN TO USE FOR that sin. GOD did not need their OPINION for him to USE IT. WHEN GOD IS raising a man to use for your life, he is not seeking for your opinion. SHOULD I USE JULIUS? SHOULD I USE NOBLE? SHOULD I USE PETER? Or should I USE SOMEBODY? HE WILL NOT ASK YOU, BUT HE WILL TELL YOU HERE IS THE MAN I'VE SENT FOR YOUR LIFE. RECEIVE HIM, LIVE, RECEIVE, REFUSE HIM, DIE. WHY? WHY? BECAUSE GOD ALLOWS THAT TO BE THERE IN THIS MAN'S LIFE to keep them humble. [screaming] YOU KNOW, EVEN PAUL HIMSELF. HE HAD THIS WHICH HE SAID UH YOU KNOW IT TROUBLED HIM AND HE ALWAYS CAME TO GOD ABOUT IT. THIS IS A MAN. THEY'LL JUST BRING PEOPLE IN HIS PRESENCE AND HIS SHADOW WILL HEAL THEM. ONE TIME HE WAS PREACHING AND A MAN DIED [screaming] BECAUSE HE WAS DOZING sitting on a ON A WINDOW AND THEN HE FELL DOWN AND DIED. I THINK HIS NAME IS UTICUS, RIGHT? BUT YOU KNOW THIS BROTHER WENT TO HIM, YOU KNOW, AND HE JUST RAISED HIM AS IF THE MAN WAS SLEEPING. THAT'S THE KIND OF ANOINTING THIS MAN. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HIS TROUBLE, HIS PROBLEM, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER HE COMES TO GOD, OH GOD, [screaming] TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME. GOD SIMPLY ANSWERED AND HE SAID, "MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOU." SO GOD GIVES HIS MEN, HIS SERVANTS, A CERTAIN GRACE, A CERTAIN PORTION OF GRACE. [screaming] THAT NOT ANYBODY HAS. THAT IS WHY WHEN GOD HAS ANOINTED A MAN AND CALLED HIM, DON'T ALWAYS TOUCH THEM. HE SAYS, "TOUCH NOT [screaming] MY ANOINTED WHOM MY PROPHETS KNOW HOW BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO BE UH HE WANTS THEM TO BE ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO HIM." AMEN. BROTHER BRHAM, HE HAD SO MANY ISSUES IN HIS LIFE. Do you know some of you? &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Bham had false teeth? &gt;&gt; Brother his teeth got issues and so he had to get false one. Not all of them but some a PROPHET WHO RAISED FIVE DEAD FROM to life who when a person a child was lame you know a leg like this prayed FOR IT AND GOT MANY longer this what I'm talking about the kind of anointing he had prayed for the dead they came back he prayed for the fish which was dedicated and I made many more supernatural miracles. Are you hearing me? But this is the kind of a man that could not pray for teeth to be created. So which means he went to the dentist. [groaning] Brother Bam, pray for yourself. My growth is sufficient hair. &gt;&gt; He had a bald head. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he stop the head from And you know what he did, brother Min? He got himself a wig. [snorts] Pastor Tom, you get I don't speak those things. And the believers of today are more holy than the even the sisters. Sister, YOU'RE WEARING A WIG. YOU'RE GOING TO HELL. Brother had a wig. when he WOULD GO IN SOME PLACES BECAUSE HIS VOICE WOULD BECOME HORSE AND SO HE NEEDED A WIG TO help him protect his head from the sun. So you see it's the motive why you do what you do BUT IT IS SOME WEAK SPOT HE HAD and I can GO ON AND ON TALK ABOUT MANY THINGS some of which I may not even want to talk on the pulpit THE CRITICS WILL TALK ABOUT IT AND THEY SAY YOU SEE WAS NOT A PROPHET NO DOESN'T NEED YOUR APPROVAL FOR HIM TO BE A PROPHET IF HE HAS SENT HE'S MY PROPHET THEN HE'S A PROPHET. You see when Israel they you know when Moses went off and they began to move politically. They came to Aaron. They said Aaron you see our pastor's gone for so long. They came to our don't never be an Aaron like that to give the people what they want to keep the move to keep the church together. Let let me tell you let me say this in there should be no human being who can do anything in their own to keep the church moving. No man can do that. No man should do that. Because if the church is started by God, EVEN IF THE fellowship is started by God, it cannot be kept by political maneuvers. God himself will keep it. I remember this man called um you know he Saul, King Saul The prophet was supposed to come and sacrifice offer the sacrifice but you know prophet Saul rather king Saul waited for the prophet and the prophet never showed up now we saw the people started to go the people are going I'm the king my kingdom is said I'm the I'm the I'm the king I must keep my people together said, "It's all right. I'm going to make the sacrifice." And as soon as he gave the sacrifice, &gt;&gt; the prophet arrived. The prophet was late. Let me tell you, brother, God can allow for you to feel that your pastor doesn't even mind about you. is to test your faith. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I was sick. Not even a call. They didn't even visit me. You see, it's your faith being tested. And and this man, you know, decided to do the sacrifice. And when the prophet arrived, he didn't even say, "I'm sorry, I'm late. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Do you know what he did? He started by prophesying. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? YOU know the people THE PEOPLE. [screaming] LET ME TELL YOU, GOD CALLED MAN DOES NOT MOVE BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE. DOES NOT PREACH BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE. HE PREACHES BECAUSE OF THE VISION [screaming] GOD HAS GIVEN HIM. THAT'S THE ONLY THING HE KEEPS HIGH HIS EYES [screaming] ON AND THE PEOPLE MUST ALIGN themselves to that vision. Amen. If the GOD SPEAKS TO THE PASTOR, WE ARE GOING TO GET LAND OF 500 MILLION. WELL, IF YOU BELIEVE IS YOUR PASTOR, STAND BEHIND THAT. SUPPORT IT. DO ALL YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU SEE GOD NEVER SPOKE TO YOU, SPOKE TO HIM. THERE'S ONLY ONE VISION BEAR AT A TIME. We've even had people who say, "WELL, PASTOR, FOR US, WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WE GIVE OUR MONEY AND THEY READ IT." THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN WE GIVE WITH OUR RIGHT HAND OUR LEFT SHOULD we don't want anybody TO KNOW. SO WHY DO you stand in the church and pray? Yet doesn't the Bible say when you pray don't pray like the Pharisees who lift up their hands in the church. Go in private and pray. Don't misinterpret scripture. Focus on the vision. Focus on the vision. I said focus ON THE VISION. AND THE PROPHET SAID SACRI LIKE LIKE I SAID SACRIFICE UH OBEDIENCE IS BETTER THAN SACRIFICE. And it was good. The kingdom was going to be with you forever. BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, IT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. GOD HELP US THAT THE kingdom will not be taken away from us. Let us not step into positions into roles into responsibilities the Holy Spirit has not asked us to step it will obscure the vision. So they now they they you know these people made a couch. They started drifting off the vision. They wanted to have a visible God that they can worship. But Moses helped to bring them back again to sanity. He brought them back again. And that's the anointing that is always on a man that God has chosen in that time. And I tell you, God has sent us a prophet in this generation. And he has brought the people back again to sanity. He has brought the church back again to sanity. And as I'm preaching to finish now this, you know, then we come to Kadesh Badesh. Probably on Wednesday I'm going to deal with Kadesh Banesh in detail. But you see this was the border of the promised land. Moses now sends out spies to the land. 10 spies to come, you know, and see how the land is. So they went with mixed and conflicting testimonies. BUT YOU SEE THE TWO, they were the only one that caught the vision. They caught the vision. Did you know that unbelief cannot hinder God? So it's better you catch the vision quickly. You be a part of the one in a million. There were over two million people that left Egypt but only two made. One in a million be one in a million. And what happened at Kadesh Beradesh will show you how people can move politically, maneuver, try to DO try to obscure or to hinder the vision. God told them, YOU WILL GO TO THE PROMISED LAND. THE LAND IS YOURS. IT IS FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. YOU WILL TAKE IT. BUT WHEN THESE PEOPLE CAME BACK, THE 10 SPIES, THEY SAID, "NO, [screaming] THE LAND IS GOOD." YEAH, FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. YEAH. WE EVEN HAVE THE FRUITS. BUT THIS IS A LAND THAT EATS THE INHABITANTS THERE. THE LAND HAS GIANTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TAKE IT. BUT YOU SEE TWO WITNESSES THEY HAD CAUGHT THE VISION. THEY SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IS THERE. WE WILL NOT TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THERE. WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT GOD HAS SAID. GOD HAS SAID ONE THING THAT THE LAND IS GOOD AND THE LAND IS YOURS. [screaming] FOR ALL WE KNOW, WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND. IT DOESN'T MATTER. [screaming] THERE ARE GIANTS THERE. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HARD IT LOOKS. GOD PROMISED [screaming] IT. THAT SETTLES IN IT SHALL HAPPEN. [screaming] EVEN AS HE SAID, THE LAND IS OURS. WE WILL TAKE IT. WE WILL POSSESS [screaming] IT. AND THESE MEN WERE BORN. H THEY HAD CAUGHT THE VISION. THEY HAD CAUGHT THE vision and many times they even started quoting Moses later on after Moses died. Many times they will quote him. Talk about WHAT MOSES HAD SAID, what God had told Moses and what they also believed. WE'RE GOING TO GO AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE LAND. YOU KNOW WHAT? THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE TO THEM THEIR VISION WAS OBSCURED. They were blinded TO THE VISION [screaming] AND GOD NEVER ALLOWED THEM TO GO AND you see saints. Always know the the the the the vessel. There are three things you should know. The season you are in as a person, the vessel God has chosen to use and the vision. Because you see this vision, this this vessel is the vision bearer.
