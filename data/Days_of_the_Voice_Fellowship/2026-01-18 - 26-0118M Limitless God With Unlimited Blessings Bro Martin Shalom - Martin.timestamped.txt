[1:20:35] We are reading from verses 15.
[1:20:40] and reading the name of the Lord.
[1:20:45] Amen.
[1:20:47] And the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:20:50] Abram out of heaven the second time, and
[1:20:53] said, "By myself I have uh by myself
[1:20:57] have I sworn, says the Lord. For because
[1:21:01] thou hast done this thing, and hast not
[1:21:03] withheld thy son, thine only son, that
[1:21:08] in blessing I will bless thee, and in
[1:21:10] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[1:21:14] the stars of heaven, and as the son
[1:21:17] which is upon the seashore, and thy seed
[1:21:20] shall possess the gates uh the gate of
[1:21:23] his enemy. And in thy seed shall all the
[1:21:26] nation of the earth be blessed because
[1:21:29] thou has obeyed my voice.
[1:21:43] Now you get
[1:22:19] Amen.
[1:22:20] Precious Lord Jesus,
[1:22:24] we thank you Lord.
[1:22:26] We have read the post John of the
[1:22:28] scripture
[1:22:31] on our
[1:22:33] father Abraham,
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; the father of faith.
[1:22:39] Lord, we pray
[1:22:41] that you come and take the full prayer.
[1:22:45] We refuse every working of the enemy.
[1:22:49] We seal all other voices today
[1:22:53] and let your voice be heard in our
[1:22:54] midst.
[1:22:56] For you promise that two or three,
[1:23:00] you will come and be in our midst.
[1:23:03] Lord that is our confidence this morning
[1:23:06] to know that you are here.
[1:23:09] You have a table spray
[1:23:11] and we have come to die
[1:23:14] in Christ Jesus.
[1:23:17] Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[1:23:20] Lord.
[1:23:22] You may have your seats.
[1:23:26] Yeah. This morning,
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; uh,
[1:23:33] I'm going to talk about Limitless God.
[1:23:41] That's my text.
[1:23:44] Limitless God.
[1:23:49] With unlimited blessing.
[1:23:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:57] Amen. Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And we've seen where we have just read
[1:24:02] God speaking to Abraham.
[1:24:06] And all Bible readers knows about
[1:24:08] Abraham.
[1:24:11] How is the father of faith?
[1:24:15] How God called him
[1:24:18] out of nowhere.
[1:24:20] Not because he was good.
[1:24:24] Brother Edson, you're most welcome.
[1:24:27] God bless you.
[1:24:29] How he was good, he was not good.
[1:24:34] But out of the blue,
[1:24:37] just like the way God called Noah,
[1:24:41] praise be to God. Amen. The Bible tells
[1:24:45] us about Abraham.
[1:24:47] I was the son of Terror.
[1:24:50] And God one day
[1:24:53] by unmmerited grace
[1:24:57] met Abraham.
[1:24:59] He called him and told him to leave his
[1:25:02] land
[1:25:04] to leave his country
[1:25:06] and go to another country where God had
[1:25:10] chosen him to do.
[1:25:12] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:25:15] Amen. And Abraham obeyed the voice of
[1:25:18] God.
[1:25:20] and went to that land. He started the
[1:25:24] journey
[1:25:25] to the land where he had never been
[1:25:27] before.
[1:25:29] Praise be to God. That is how interested
[1:25:32] our God is.
[1:25:34] When God called us, when he calls you,
[1:25:38] he tells you about the promised land,
[1:25:41] about the rapture.
[1:25:43] Amen. Jesus said, "I'm going to prepare
[1:25:46] a place
[1:25:48] and where I'm going to be, you'll also
[1:25:51] be there."
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; He he never talked about these other
[1:25:59] things.
[1:26:01] He says
[1:26:05] that in this earth there is a lot of
[1:26:06] sorrow. He did not specify which
[1:26:10] type of sorrow but there are many
[1:26:12] sorrow.
[1:26:17] Take heart. Blessed be the name of the
[1:26:19] Lord. So is limitless God.
[1:26:24] Blessed be the name of God. And where we
[1:26:26] have read here. Here we are seeing God
[1:26:29] calling Abraham.
[1:26:31] The angel of God called unto Abraham out
[1:26:34] of heaven.
[1:26:36] Second time. Here we are reading this
[1:26:39] for the second time.
[1:26:41] And he said,
[1:26:44] and and said, "By myself I have sworn,
[1:26:49] says the Lord,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; for because thou has done this thing,
[1:26:55] and has not withheld thy son,
[1:26:59] thy only son,
[1:27:03] that in blessing I will bless thee,
[1:27:07] and in multiplying I will multiply thy
[1:27:11] son.
[1:27:13] as the stars of heaven,
[1:27:15] and as the son which is upon the
[1:27:18] seashore,
[1:27:20] and thy seed shall possess
[1:27:24] the gate of his enemy.
[1:27:28] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:27:31] Amen. Amen. Thy seed shall possess the
[1:27:34] gates of his enemy.
[1:27:37] Here we are seeing God promising Abraham
[1:27:39] blessing.
[1:27:41] But it was after something had happened.
[1:27:45] Abraham obeyed the voice of God.
[1:27:49] God told Abraham.
[1:27:51] Praise be to God. God gave a promise
[1:27:55] with this promise took so long
[1:27:58] and finally it came to pass.
[1:28:01] Because when God give a promise,
[1:28:04] no matter how long it will take,
[1:28:07] but in finally it will come to pass.
[1:28:10] Because if God send this word,
[1:28:13] this word does not return to him for
[1:28:16] you.
[1:28:17] That word will have to perform.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. When God gives
[1:28:25] us the word of promise
[1:28:28] says I'm the Lord God
[1:28:31] all your diseases.
[1:28:33] He means that. And when you are sick,
[1:28:37] you are under obligation.
[1:28:40] Come to God. Tell God promise.
[1:28:44] Amen. That by your stripes, I am healed.
[1:28:50] Praise be to God. And when you cling
[1:28:52] onto that,
[1:28:54] you stand in that word. When you claim
[1:28:56] that promise, you don't have demons,
[1:29:00] you can defy that word.
[1:29:04] Thus say,
[1:29:06] "Praise be to God." The prophet says,
[1:29:10] "The word of God will defeat the devil
[1:29:14] any time,
[1:29:16] anywhere,
[1:29:17] any place,
[1:29:19] praise be to God because when God
[1:29:22] speaks,
[1:29:24] that word cannot."
[1:29:26] So when God called Abraham,
[1:29:29] Abraham left his country.
[1:29:32] Praise be to God. And he went, he
[1:29:35] started at Genesis 21.
[1:29:38] And we all know the story that alongside
[1:29:41] the way,
[1:29:43] he went with
[1:29:45] with Lord,
[1:29:48] praise be to God, and as long as they
[1:29:51] were still together,
[1:29:53] he never heard the voice of God.
[1:29:56] He had troubles.
[1:29:59] Praise be to God.
[1:30:01] Amen. The handsman started fighting.
[1:30:07] So as long as we car things
[1:30:11] which God
[1:30:15] does not expect us to have.
[1:30:20] We are going to have trouble.
[1:30:23] We are going to have chaos.
[1:30:26] Praise be to God. Our salvation will be
[1:30:29] full of trouble.
[1:30:32] Every time a believer complaining,
[1:30:36] everything is not working. I have prayed
[1:30:38] and prayed. I God is unfair.
[1:30:43] God is not unfair.
[1:30:46] Are you certain of God?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Have you checked yourself?
[1:30:52] Are you carrying on with the Lord?
[1:30:56] Blessed be the name of the Lord. My text
[1:30:59] is
[1:31:00] a limitless God.
[1:31:03] You cannot limit him.
[1:31:06] God can do anything
[1:31:11] anywhere
[1:31:13] at any place regardless of the
[1:31:15] situation.
[1:31:17] Praise be to God. You can't limit him.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:24] Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; When God speaks,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; he means it.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; So, it's limitless
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; and it's packed with unlimited
[1:31:39] blessings.
[1:31:44] Amen. God's blessing is unlimited.
[1:31:50] Praise be to God.
[1:31:52] But there's only one problem.
[1:31:56] It's a condition.
[1:31:58] Hallelujah. If we obey,
[1:32:01] we shall enjoy the fruit of the land.
[1:32:05] If we don't obey, we will have trouble.
[1:32:09] We'll have problems. But I'm here to
[1:32:11] tell you that our God is limitless
[1:32:17] and he carries unlimited blessings.
[1:32:21] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:32:24] Looking to see
[1:32:27] there is no limit to the blessings that
[1:32:30] God will pour down upon a believer.
[1:32:43] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:32:45] that God will pour down upon a believer
[1:32:48] that will believe.
[1:32:53] And he says in spiritual inspiration,
[1:32:57] God's blessings
[1:33:00] will never be exhausted to a believer.
[1:33:07] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[1:33:09] whole world
[1:33:12] can never exhaust God's presence.
[1:33:17] Blessed be the name of God. But there is
[1:33:20] only one condition
[1:33:22] to walk in the words.
[1:33:25] There we activate these things.
[1:33:28] Activate unlimited power of God
[1:33:32] in the name of God. When we are in the
[1:33:34] word, God is limitless.
[1:33:38] There's nothing that can limit him.
[1:33:41] Praise be to God. One time Paul and
[1:33:43] Silas when they in jail,
[1:33:47] Amen. They thought that was the end of
[1:33:50] them,
[1:33:52] maybe even themselves.
[1:33:55] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:33:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So when they in
[1:34:00] change
[1:34:03] they may be themselves
[1:34:07] because they are human being like us.
[1:34:11] They feel pain like us
[1:34:14] after being beaten
[1:34:16] after being tortured.
[1:34:19] They are in chain and they're in prison.
[1:34:23] Blessed be the Lord. But their suffering
[1:34:26] was for good cause.
[1:34:29] because of the gospel.
[1:34:32] Praise be to God. And somewhere somehow
[1:34:36] maybe when they were there pondering
[1:34:39] on what made them to be beaten
[1:34:42] or what made them to be to be arrested.
[1:34:46] Hallelujah. You know a believer we have
[1:34:50] something unique in us.
[1:34:53] The spirit of God in us. the spirit of
[1:34:57] God in our
[1:34:59] when we are discouraged.
[1:35:01] That is what encourages us.
[1:35:04] Praise be to God. And maybe when they
[1:35:07] were there,
[1:35:09] something inside them
[1:35:12] was whispering to them.
[1:35:15] You see, see now the reward.
[1:35:18] You've been preaching, casting out
[1:35:20] demons.
[1:35:24] You've been beaten. Where is that God?
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; But these men were not discouraged.
[1:35:42] The Holy Spirit started to minister with
[1:35:44] him.
[1:35:47] That is the God we serve.
[1:35:51] When you reach a point where you're
[1:35:53] seeing there is no hope,
[1:35:56] there is no plan B,
[1:35:59] there's no plan C.
[1:36:01] God is only plan A.
[1:36:05] Praise be to God. You know why God is
[1:36:08] only plan A?
[1:36:10] God cannot fail.
[1:36:13] Amen. He knows end from the beginning.
[1:36:18] How many steps you going to take on
[1:36:20] earth?
[1:36:22] last step. Glory.
[1:36:27] Amen. And he has commission each one of
[1:36:29] us
[1:36:31] to be guided by angel
[1:36:35] that guardian angel
[1:36:37] guiding you every day.
[1:36:40] We have deployment all over this place
[1:36:43] right now
[1:36:46] as we are protecting.
[1:36:48] Blessed be the name of
[1:36:51] and our God cannot run short of God.
[1:36:56] Hallelujah.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name.
[1:37:01] That's right. Through all the dark ages
[1:37:06] today, our God has never run short of
[1:37:10] forces.
[1:37:14] And I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:37:16] that our God cannot be limited.
[1:37:21] And God has a limited blessing, a
[1:37:24] limited blessing,
[1:37:26] blessed be the name of. And when Abraham
[1:37:30] obeyed God,
[1:37:31] praise be to God. But God told Abra
[1:37:35] and offer his son,
[1:37:38] praise the Lord,
[1:37:41] and he obeyed.
[1:37:44] Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. The enemy is trying to
[1:37:57] uh
[1:38:00] make lose my notes. Praise be to God.
[1:38:04] Amen.
[1:38:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; And it says
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; and said uh
[1:38:28] by myself have I strong
[1:38:32] says the Lord.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; For because thou has not thou has done
[1:38:36] this thing.
[1:38:40] and has not withheld thy son.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:38:51] God swore by his soul.
[1:38:57] Praise be to God because there was no
[1:39:00] other greater
[1:39:04] that for my word to fail.
[1:39:08] Praise be to God. Because he knew that
[1:39:11] his word cannot.
[1:39:14] Hallelujah. He could not swear by any
[1:39:16] man,
[1:39:19] by any prophet or any angel
[1:39:23] by himself
[1:39:25] because he knows his word cannot fail as
[1:39:29] good as his word.
[1:39:34] And because Abraham believed God,
[1:39:39] he never spared his only son,
[1:39:42] the son of his old age.
[1:39:45] Praise be to God. It's because he had a
[1:39:47] revelation.
[1:39:49] God gives and
[1:39:52] blessed be the name.
[1:39:55] Amen. And after God tried him,
[1:40:00] he said, "Now Abraham activated God's
[1:40:03] blessing."
[1:40:07] But he had to first be tried.
[1:40:10] Every time you ask God for things,
[1:40:14] do something
[1:40:16] try by that very thing.
[1:40:19] What are you going to do?
[1:40:23] Blessed be the name. Maybe you want a
[1:40:26] phone. He gives you a phone and he
[1:40:30] wonders how are you going to use that
[1:40:31] phone?
[1:40:37] Maybe you pray for a car.
[1:40:40] He has given you a car.
[1:40:43] How are you going to use that car?
[1:40:47] Blessed be the name of
[1:40:52] maybe brother Martin used to come early
[1:40:57] by 8
[1:41:00] and after God giving him a car
[1:41:03] he comes at midday
[1:41:09] you can't activate God is bless
[1:41:15] bless Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:41:18] Amen.
[1:41:19] So I was telling about Paul and Silas
[1:41:23] when they in shame
[1:41:26] something within them
[1:41:28] the Holy Ghost minister to them. And the
[1:41:31] Bible says they started to praise God.
[1:41:36] Amen. Because they knew it was them in
[1:41:40] shame,
[1:41:42] not God in chain.
[1:41:46] Because greater in them
[1:41:49] was greater than the one the shame.
[1:41:55] And the Bible say they started to praise
[1:41:58] God.
[1:42:00] Hallelujah. Amen. And through praising
[1:42:03] God,
[1:42:04] praising God.
[1:42:06] Amen. Something happened.
[1:42:11] I don't think it was the first song.
[1:42:13] neither
[1:42:16] the second one. Praise be to God because
[1:42:20] they had to be tried.
[1:42:22] They had to be proved by the gospel they
[1:42:26] preached.
[1:42:28] Yes.
[1:42:30] The very Jesus who make the lamb to walk
[1:42:34] to see love to hear
[1:42:37] when comes the preachers.
[1:42:41] Will you believe?
[1:42:44] Amen. That that same Jesus can open your
[1:42:49] death ears.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; It is very easy bro. It's very simple to
[1:42:57] tell others to convince others.
[1:43:02] Yes sir.
[1:43:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:06] Amen. But when it comes to you
[1:43:10] tells
[1:43:12] To pray for someone who is sick,
[1:43:17] you have to first feel that
[1:43:21] empathy.
[1:43:26] You be in their shoes
[1:43:30] because even Jesus is the high priest
[1:43:34] who is touched by the feeling of our
[1:43:37] infirmities.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The reason why Jesus came on
[1:43:42] flesh,
[1:43:44] he wanted to test what we testing today.
[1:43:49] He went through the pain we are going
[1:43:50] through.
[1:43:52] When you say my body is aching,
[1:43:58] Jesus knows what it mean.
[1:44:04] Jesus knows what headache.
[1:44:08] When you say I am tempted,
[1:44:11] Jesus knows what it means to be tempted.
[1:44:14] That's why he is the high priest
[1:44:18] who is touched by the feeling of Christ.
[1:44:24] Blessed be the name of
[1:44:27] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That
[1:44:31] is the God we are serving. We not
[1:44:34] serving a strange God.
[1:44:36] We are not serving a deaf God.
[1:44:39] We are serving a God who feels, who
[1:44:43] hears, who sees. Amen. That is our God.
[1:44:50] Many time when we are trying,
[1:44:53] we think he's just there.
[1:44:57] The other day one brother was telling
[1:44:58] me,
[1:45:01] he was telling me sometime how the
[1:45:03] Pentecostals pray.
[1:45:07] Oh God for you. You are there.
[1:45:10] You are enjoying.
[1:45:12] Angels are waving over you.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus knows what it means to be there
[1:45:32] without even a call.
[1:45:35] But because he is limitless
[1:45:39] and is packed with unlimited
[1:45:43] blessings is everywhere.
[1:45:46] One day a blind bath came to him.
[1:45:51] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. He
[1:45:54] came crying said Jesus son of David have
[1:45:59] mercy on me.
[1:46:02] You know what Jesus did?
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; He never asked Peter for medical kit.
[1:46:11] He not check his eyes.
[1:46:14] Let us see.
[1:46:21] Praise be to God. That day
[1:46:25] the world did not know
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; the secret on the ground.
[1:46:31] Jesus just sp
[1:46:39] and smeared on the ground
[1:46:42] and he gain his sight
[1:46:45] unlimited blessing.
[1:46:48] Amen.
[1:46:50] You can't limit our God.
[1:46:53] Many time when we are squeezed,
[1:46:56] you wonder how you're going to go
[1:46:58] through that.
[1:47:00] He comes and makes a way.
[1:47:03] That is the God we are serving.
[1:47:06] We cannot fail and he's not going to
[1:47:09] fail us.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of.
[1:47:14] Amen. What is keeping us going
[1:47:20] unlimited bless?
[1:47:22] Because our God is limitless.
[1:47:28] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[1:47:31] after Abraham had gone through the test
[1:47:34] and he told him
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; in blessings,
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he told that you your seed
[1:47:44] possess the gates of
[1:47:49] Amen.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; We are to possess the gates of our
[1:47:52] enemy.
[1:47:54] Blessed be the name
[1:47:57] That is a promise. God gave it to us. He
[1:48:00] said to receive it, not reject it.
[1:48:05] That's what the Lord said and that
[1:48:07] cannot fail.
[1:48:09] Blessed be the name.
[1:48:11] I'm going to read something uh in in the
[1:48:15] book of Psalms.
[1:48:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:37] Somehow I lost my notes but I know God
[1:48:39] will give me the grace.
[1:48:43] Praise be to God.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Uh I want us to read read with me
[1:48:51] Psalms.
[1:49:02] Amen.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:18] I want us to read uh and see uh here in
[1:49:20] Psalms.
[1:49:25] what God some of the things which God
[1:49:27] did in Egypt.
[1:49:35] Here
[1:49:43] it says in Psalms chapter 78
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; uh from vers 15.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Okay, we can start from uh we can start
[1:49:58] from verse 9. He say that he divided the
[1:49:59] sea and caused them to pass through and
[1:50:02] he made them to pass through and he made
[1:50:06] the waters to stand as a heap. In the
[1:50:09] daytime also he led them with a cloud
[1:50:12] and all the night with a light of fire.
[1:50:16] You can read
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; that is Psalms chapter 78 uh from vers
[1:50:22] 13.
[1:50:26] Yes.
[1:50:54] many time when read uh such a scripture
[1:50:58] we read like we're reading a novel.
[1:51:03] But when you read this scripture
[1:51:05] and you ponder,
[1:51:08] you see what your God can do
[1:51:13] and you compare that with your
[1:51:14] situation,
[1:51:17] the things that you are going through,
[1:51:20] the God we are speaking about
[1:51:22] is a God who parted se.
[1:51:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:33] 35 say, "And they remembered that God,
[1:51:38] sorry, hed the rock in the wilderness
[1:51:42] and gave them drink as out of great
[1:51:45] depth.
[1:51:52] He brought streams also out of the rock
[1:51:55] and caused the waters to run down like
[1:51:58] river.
[1:52:06] And they sinned yet more against him by
[1:52:09] provoking the most high in the
[1:52:11] wilderness.
[1:52:17] And they tempted God in their heart by
[1:52:20] asking me for their lust.
[1:52:28] Yeah. They spoke against God and they
[1:52:30] said, "Can God furnish a temple in the
[1:52:32] wilderness?"
[1:52:41] After doing all those things,
[1:52:44] that is the nature of human being.
[1:52:49] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:52:53] They never get satisfied.
[1:53:00] Somebody can say give me some 50,000
[1:53:03] and then you give them
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; I wish I asked for 200,000
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; blessed be
[1:53:12] but with human being
[1:53:18] we are we have a limit
[1:53:21] whatever we do has a limit.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name.
[1:53:26] Hallelujah.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; But our God, he has a limitless
[1:53:30] blessing,
[1:53:32] unlimited blessing.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; But he only calls us.
[1:53:38] He's calling us to walk in the word.
[1:53:41] Believe
[1:53:43] to trust him because it is possible.
[1:53:48] With him all things are possible.
[1:53:52] Blessed be the name of the Lord. He only
[1:53:54] called upon
[1:53:56] to obey the word
[1:53:59] to live according to that word.
[1:54:03] Blessed be the name of
[1:54:05] God has never failed anybody.
[1:54:09] He has never failed any human being.
[1:54:12] He always be there on time.
[1:54:17] Many time we don't hold on enough.
[1:54:23] Blessed be the name of
[1:54:27] But when you think he's not coming,
[1:54:33] he is already present.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name.
[1:54:38] So our God,
[1:54:41] they tempted him.
[1:54:45] And
[1:54:46] this thing is not very far from us.
[1:54:50] God heals you today.
[1:54:53] Tomorrow another situation arises
[1:54:57] and you doubt.
[1:55:01] Praise be to God
[1:55:04] and you think maybe you are not sick the
[1:55:06] other day.
[1:55:10] It was just feelings
[1:55:13] and that's what the devil always do.
[1:55:18] But the God we are serving
[1:55:21] is a miracle working God
[1:55:24] and you cannot limit him.
[1:55:27] He makes there's no
[1:55:30] blessed be the name.
[1:55:32] The Bible says
[1:55:37] that God allowed them
[1:55:40] to go through what they went through.
[1:55:43] Blessed be the name because he wanted to
[1:55:46] see what was in their heart.
[1:55:49] Amen. When God called Abraham after he
[1:55:53] had obeyed
[1:55:55] to the maximum,
[1:55:58] God released his blessing.
[1:56:02] And all of us we looking at God is
[1:56:03] blessing
[1:56:05] and we'll have to obey the word first.
[1:56:10] Amen. Amen. Because our God has no
[1:56:13] limit.
[1:56:15] When he speaks, he means it.
[1:56:18] It's God who fulfills his word.
[1:56:21] He spoke and said, "The virgin shall
[1:56:22] conceive."
[1:56:24] Took many years, but it came to pass
[1:56:28] because the Lord God has spoken.
[1:56:32] And that same God promised us in last
[1:56:35] year
[1:56:38] that we send a prophet. It took many
[1:56:41] years. Finally
[1:56:44] came.
[1:56:45] Amen. And we are here waiting
[1:56:49] for the coming of the Lord.
[1:56:53] And we are so sure
[1:56:56] that he's coming soon
[1:56:58] because he has given us down pain
[1:57:02] which is the birth of the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:05] Amen.
[1:57:07] Hallelujah.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let us press on
[1:57:11] knowing that our God
[1:57:14] will never limit our God.
[1:57:18] Just imagination of Israel
[1:57:21] after God had done all this
[1:57:30] parting
[1:57:33] and just putting table.
[1:57:38] Which one is harder?
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:57:43] Redeeming your soul,
[1:57:46] giving you salvation
[1:57:49] and healing your body.
[1:57:51] Which one is more hard?
[1:57:56] Giving his son.
[1:57:59] Amen. As a ransom for sinner
[1:58:05] and giving you money.
[1:58:09] Which one is high?
[1:58:12] Blessed be the name.
[1:58:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:21] So he's a limitless God.
[1:58:25] With unlimited blessing,
[1:58:28] blessed be the name of.
[1:58:31] Amen. He said that so Abraham turned to
[1:58:35] histo
[1:58:39] young young men
[1:58:43] 19.
[1:58:44] He turned at his young men
[1:58:51] and rose up and went together to Bashba
[1:58:56] and Abraham dwelt at Bashba.
[1:58:59] pass after these things
[1:59:01] of Abraham saying
[1:59:04] behold Mila.
[1:59:06] She hath also bon children unto thy
[1:59:09] brother
[1:59:12] who is his firstborn
[1:59:15] and B his brother
[1:59:18] came the father
[1:59:21] and sh and and
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; praise be to God.
[1:59:29] Amen.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; In verse 12, this say and Sarah was uh
[1:59:32] was 107 and two and and 20 years.
[1:59:40] There were the years of the life of
[1:59:42] Sarah.
[1:59:48] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Because
[1:59:50] Sarah had a promise.
[1:59:53] God had promised Abraham.
[1:59:56] had to bear a son
[1:59:59] and because he obeyed the word,
[2:00:03] God had to honor his promise
[2:00:07] even this generation we are living in.
[2:00:10] He promised us
[2:00:13] we are going to be raptured
[2:00:16] and that's what that's where our hope is
[2:00:22] every single day.
[2:00:24] Even when you feel like giving up,
[2:00:27] just remember.
[2:00:29] Amen. Remember for future home.
[2:00:33] Blessed be the name of God. You cannot
[2:00:36] limit God.
[2:00:39] And we should never do that.
[2:00:41] We know where we are going. We know
[2:00:44] where we came from. If you don't know
[2:00:46] where you came from, then you have
[2:00:48] amnesia.
[2:00:50] Every time I think of looking back,
[2:00:54] I see I've come too far
[2:00:57] to look back.
[2:00:59] Blessed be the name of I believe when I
[2:01:02] was 13.
[2:01:04] Blessed be the name of.
[2:01:06] Amen. Until today,
[2:01:14] there is no reason of me looking back.
[2:01:21] Because the Bible tells us to look unto
[2:01:24] Jesus
[2:01:26] who is the author
[2:01:28] who is the finisher.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It is Jesus who called
[2:01:33] us. As long as Abraham looked at God.
[2:01:38] Amen. He was willing.
[2:01:41] As long as Israel looking they look
[2:01:45] they never lost even single battle
[2:01:49] always want us to look back
[2:01:54] around us battles we are fighting
[2:01:58] brother sister. It is God fighting for
[2:02:00] us.
[2:02:02] He said they shall you shall hold your
[2:02:05] peace
[2:02:07] and I will fight for you.
[2:02:10] We always lose the battle because we
[2:02:11] mama.
[2:02:14] We think it is our battle.
[2:02:19] Things are not moving well.
[2:02:21] But how shall we overcome?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; In younger.
[2:02:38] Praise be to God. Death does not mean
[2:02:41] that you are being defeated.
[2:02:44] Our death is just a rest.
[2:02:48] When Elisha died
[2:02:50] and they threw the dead body
[2:02:53] and the dead body came in contact to his
[2:02:56] bones,
[2:02:59] the Bible says the dead man resurrected.
[2:03:05] Praise be to God.
[2:03:07] Amen.
[2:03:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that's why
[2:03:14] we can never be defeated because the one
[2:03:16] we are serving
[2:03:19] God has never lost anybody.
[2:03:22] He will always win
[2:03:25] proof to the devil.
[2:03:28] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:03:31] Amen. Amen. He has given us the best,
[2:03:35] the best weapon,
[2:03:37] the best antidote,
[2:03:40] the best victory.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:47] Amen. Amen. The God we are serving,
[2:03:51] he has never failed.
[2:03:53] He will never fail us.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage you this
[2:03:57] morning.
[2:03:59] Let us keep pressing on.
[2:04:02] Let us keep pushing on.
[2:04:05] Blessed be the name of God.
[2:04:09] Amen. Amen. is a limitless
[2:04:13] God
[2:04:15] with unlimited blessing.
[2:04:19] The proverb says here
[2:04:21] in the in the message uh the lamb's book
[2:04:23] of life
[2:04:26] before the foundation of the world
[2:04:29] when Satan perverted uh perverted to
[2:04:33] evil
[2:04:36] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:04:39] Amen.
[2:04:41] When Satan perverted to evil,
[2:04:46] God being infinite
[2:04:49] looked down through the stream of time
[2:04:53] and saw the end
[2:04:56] for knowledge.
[2:04:59] If he didn't if he didn't know all
[2:05:01] things,
[2:05:03] you have a limited God.
[2:05:07] You have made him finite like you have.
[2:05:14] God is unlimited.
[2:05:16] God is power
[2:05:19] knowledge.
[2:05:22] He is omotant.
[2:05:24] And way back before the foundation of
[2:05:26] the earth
[2:05:28] when Satan done the evil
[2:05:30] caused Satan
[2:05:33] had his mind
[2:05:36] what he was going to do.
[2:05:40] God seen how he could how he could
[2:05:43] contract it.
[2:05:46] Praise be to God. Are you seeing the God
[2:05:48] we are serving?
[2:05:50] He sees the plan of the devil.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; God does not disorganize Satan's plans.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; He allows the devil
[2:06:07] to do his ammunitions.
[2:06:10] What God does,
[2:06:13] you will get a solution. Blessed be the
[2:06:15] name of the Lord.
[2:06:17] If you realize among us this papa
[2:06:19] countries
[2:06:23] there's a country like America,
[2:06:27] you rarely hear them bragging.
[2:06:32] No sir, but there are some other small
[2:06:34] nations.
[2:06:38] Even Russia will never hear Russia
[2:06:39] bragging.
[2:06:42] But there's no small nation.
[2:06:45] Every small thing now we have this now
[2:06:49] this one this weapon
[2:06:52] of an eye
[2:06:54] this and this
[2:06:57] and before you realize
[2:07:00] they have beaten them up.
[2:07:03] Praise be to God.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you wonder where's all
[2:07:10] the shout.
[2:07:14] Look at Israel. Where is position today?
[2:07:18] The battles they are fighting. There is
[2:07:20] no other nation in the world
[2:07:23] fighting battles like Israel.
[2:07:26] They are surrounded by the ring of fire.
[2:07:30] Praise be to God. But they are not
[2:07:33] intimidating.
[2:07:36] Iran will wake up in the morning and say
[2:07:40] in the next 24 hours
[2:07:43] you are done.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; The good thing with a Jew with Israelite
[2:07:49] they don't warn
[2:07:52] before you realize
[2:07:55] your airport is on fire.
[2:07:59] That is their warning.
[2:08:02] Praise be to God.
[2:08:04] The promise says here
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; that God way back.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew that Satan will rebel.
[2:08:14] He knew that the weapons that the devil
[2:08:16] was going to come out with
[2:08:20] solution for it
[2:08:23] and then he waited for him. Praise be to
[2:08:26] God. Oh, what a spiritual warfare.
[2:08:32] Amen. And I'm here to tell you there's
[2:08:35] no weapon in the devil's arm that the
[2:08:39] devil will come with God will run and
[2:08:42] say
[2:08:44] this one of today and this is mercy.
[2:08:49] No sir. When the devil comes out with
[2:08:52] his bed,
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; God just looked at he sees a crown.
[2:09:07] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[2:09:09] devil is carrying a huge weapon
[2:09:13] today.
[2:09:16] He knows he's carrying his best.
[2:09:19] Blessed be the name of the Lord. But
[2:09:22] there is unlimited God
[2:09:25] with unlimited weapons.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; The word of God has stood the test of
[2:09:34] time.
[2:09:37] In the beginning was the word and the
[2:09:40] word was with God
[2:09:42] and the word was God.
[2:09:45] Amen. Amen. And the prophet tells us
[2:09:48] what is the word. The word is the
[2:09:51] thought
[2:09:52] being expressed.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; There is no way the devil
[2:10:00] can defeat that.
[2:10:03] So when he carries his best
[2:10:06] day, brother is finished.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:10:16] There a lot of things coming in my mind.
[2:10:19] Just imagine
[2:10:23] you are enemies.
[2:10:25] They have made an ambush
[2:10:29] with all the tanks,
[2:10:32] with all the missile,
[2:10:35] with even nuclear
[2:10:39] talk of hydrogen bomb
[2:10:43] and all their fingers on the trigger.
[2:10:48] Blessed be the name.
[2:10:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; And they're waiting to finish you.
[2:10:55] They know you are done
[2:10:57] today. We are finished.
[2:10:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:11:04] And maybe they're on countdown.
[2:11:10] Praise be to God.
[2:11:12] They on countdown.
[2:11:15] And when it reaches zero,
[2:11:20] your God pulls out
[2:11:23] all the fuse.
[2:11:30] You see nuclear bomb,
[2:11:33] it has some component in it.
[2:11:36] And when this pulled out,
[2:11:39] it is as useless as a stick.
[2:11:45] So God wait for the devil
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; to plan his best to take his time to
[2:11:52] waste his time.
[2:11:55] Amen.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; So when is attacking
[2:11:59] he comes with a solution.
[2:12:03] Blessed be the name.
[2:12:06] That is the God we are serving.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:13] The prophet says
[2:12:19] that God's power, God's knowledge and
[2:12:21] everything is ominant.
[2:12:27] We have read there he says
[2:12:31] he says in the message hidden life
[2:12:37] there is no summit to God's power.
[2:12:44] We move on God and we move on and on and
[2:12:47] on. The unlimited resources of God has
[2:12:50] never been tapped to yet.
[2:12:57] Blessings
[2:12:59] and powers
[2:13:01] that we know nothing about.
[2:13:05] Bring all the miracles in the world,
[2:13:08] all the signs and wonders, all the
[2:13:11] healings
[2:13:13] that prophet is telling us. We have not
[2:13:16] even tapped in it.
[2:13:22] Oh, what a wonderful God.
[2:13:26] Brother, we have not seen
[2:13:36] He said the life that is within us
[2:13:40] awakening Jesus
[2:13:43] in the message awakening Jesus
[2:13:46] 63017
[2:13:49] I said the life that is within us
[2:13:53] is not only creative life
[2:13:56] it is part of his own life
[2:14:01] and that is the reason we have the
[2:14:02] authority to speak
[2:14:08] is God's own creative life.
[2:14:14] But there is if here if you are anointed
[2:14:18] correct
[2:14:26] praise be to God.
[2:14:30] This is creative power.
[2:14:33] We don't beg the devil.
[2:14:36] We rebuke.
[2:14:39] We rebuke diseases.
[2:14:42] We cast out.
[2:14:44] We don't expect to hear a brother
[2:14:46] testifying.
[2:14:48] Yesterday we were somewhere
[2:14:51] and we are praying for the patient.
[2:14:55] So we went as we were jazzing with those
[2:14:56] demons
[2:14:59] asking them where they came from
[2:15:01] and they are telling us they came from
[2:15:04] Zambia Zambia.
[2:15:11] What do you want?
[2:15:15] We are not leaving.
[2:15:18] We are taking him.
[2:15:22] And then we asked the demon what is the
[2:15:24] problem?
[2:15:32] God never said us to do it.
[2:15:35] Praise be to God.
[2:15:37] He said God therefore go into the world.
[2:15:41] Preach the gospel. Whatsoever believes
[2:15:44] and baptiz
[2:15:46] shall be saved
[2:15:48] and this son shall follow them
[2:15:53] in his name. You will cast out
[2:15:57] on the sick.
[2:16:00] Praise be to God. Casting them out
[2:16:04] time to waste.
[2:16:08] Your your time is precious.
[2:16:12] You are given all this power
[2:16:16] provided that you anointed correctly.
[2:16:20] But when you anointed wrongly,
[2:16:23] you are going to start selling the tree
[2:16:25] of life in the church
[2:16:30] and holy water.
[2:16:33] They even selling communions today,
[2:16:36] small bottles.
[2:16:42] Praise be to God. It used to be with
[2:16:45] Catholics,
[2:16:48] but today in Smon's bornagain churches,
[2:16:54] yes,
[2:16:55] they are selling them.
[2:17:02] 50,000 a pocket
[2:17:04] Jesus. Yes.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; He never sent us to sell communion.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; He never sent us to make money.
[2:17:16] He is rich.
[2:17:19] But he told us go cast out demons,
[2:17:22] preach the gospel,
[2:17:24] heal the sick, cleanse the lepers. We
[2:17:28] are given free
[2:17:30] freely give.
[2:17:32] Blessed be the name of the Lord. But
[2:17:35] when say we have creative power,
[2:17:38] we can create atmosphere around our
[2:17:40] home,
[2:17:42] atmosphere around our workplace.
[2:17:46] Yes sir, you can create one where you
[2:17:48] are right now.
[2:17:51] Do you know the reason as to why you are
[2:17:53] slumbering?
[2:17:56] Because bad spirit are hovering over
[2:17:57] you.
[2:18:08] The S is in front but for you feeling
[2:18:10] something.
[2:18:15] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister,
[2:18:22] we are sons of God.
[2:18:25] I was just reminding ourselves
[2:18:29] that our God has limitless
[2:18:32] if we obey the word.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we walk in the word,
[2:18:39] praise be to God. There's nothing that
[2:18:42] we cannot do.
[2:18:44] There is no miracle that cannot be
[2:18:46] performed by a believer.
[2:18:50] Praise be to God.
[2:18:53] There is no sickness that has audacity
[2:18:57] over you
[2:19:01] that can put you under shame
[2:19:05] say that Calvary
[2:19:09] the devil's back was broken.
[2:19:13] Amen. We are dealing with a with a sick
[2:19:16] guy.
[2:19:19] The strength of human being is back upon
[2:19:23] And when your backbone is broken,
[2:19:26] you are as good as a jellyfish.
[2:19:34] Jellyfish,
[2:19:47] jellyfish.
[2:19:51] It does not have a backbone.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; It has to wait for the waves to come
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; and then the waves take it and
[2:20:02] if it has to go the other side, it has
[2:20:04] to wait for waves.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; So the devil's back was broken.
[2:20:09] If you start talking about how
[2:20:12] limitless is our God
[2:20:17] through the ages,
[2:20:20] God has proved that.
[2:20:24] Amen.
[2:20:28] Talk of the matters
[2:20:30] how they were killed.
[2:20:33] How they were murdered.
[2:20:35] Amen. But God has always proved
[2:20:41] that he is God.
[2:20:44] Blessed be the name.
[2:20:46] He has never failed anywhere.
[2:20:50] Some told the Israelites.
[2:20:52] Amen. Remember when you remember the
[2:20:54] Jero saga?
[2:20:56] Not to fight but just sing.
[2:21:01] Just rotate the city seven
[2:21:04] days.
[2:21:06] Praise be to God. On the last day seven
[2:21:09] days
[2:21:10] and just shout
[2:21:13] that is the God we are serving.
[2:21:16] Amen.
[2:21:19] There's no reason as to why
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; a believer is dry
[2:21:28] where you there are some believers
[2:21:36] to get an from them.
[2:21:44] I don't remember when I last slumbered
[2:21:46] in church.
[2:21:50] Because when you just close your eyes
[2:21:54] and you think of God's goodness,
[2:21:59] brethren,
[2:22:01] there's something that I've realized
[2:22:04] during this uh internet shutdown.
[2:22:12] I realize that we believers
[2:22:20] age when they cut off internet it is
[2:22:23] like we went back into stony age period
[2:22:27] and I was thinking how rapture will be
[2:22:32] just imagine
[2:22:34] you are in a situation
[2:22:37] you're not even sure whether brother is
[2:22:45] That's why
[2:22:47] we better be ready for the rapture,
[2:22:52] brethren. It is sacred
[2:22:56] catching away of the bride.
[2:23:03] Praise be to God.
[2:23:07] Let us be on our knees. Let's be
[2:23:10] connected spiritually.
[2:23:17] Praise be to God.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; But one thing I know when I was coming
[2:23:27] this morning,
[2:23:29] the place not very far from home
[2:23:34] was in a trench.
[2:23:36] I saw a very big plant.
[2:23:40] This plant grew
[2:23:42] in between the rock
[2:23:45] and and cement
[2:23:50] and I was I was just imagining the power
[2:23:55] of God
[2:23:56] in the seed.
[2:24:00] It was not even a big plant but just I
[2:24:02] think
[2:24:04] I think it is just some green plant.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; I even took its picture because it was
[2:24:12] amazing.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; And then something came in my mind
[2:24:16] that that is how
[2:24:19] the children of God are.
[2:24:22] No matter where they are,
[2:24:25] no matter how chained they are,
[2:24:30] there is a force within them.
[2:24:33] Amen. The life of God that breaks every
[2:24:37] chain.
[2:24:40] How could that small tiny seed
[2:24:44] penetrate through hard
[2:24:48] if that is not God? What is wrong
[2:24:54] and what makes you think
[2:24:56] God cannot deliver you out of the
[2:24:58] situation you
[2:25:00] go?
[2:25:03] Praise be to God. If just a little plant
[2:25:08] can penetrate through the hard.
[2:25:12] Oh brother, sister, how much more the
[2:25:15] spirit of God,
[2:25:17] the Holy Ghost is more than able to set
[2:25:22] us free out of every chain,
[2:25:25] out of every bondage
[2:25:29] that God is more than able
[2:25:33] out of every habit.
[2:25:36] I don't care how strong it is.
[2:25:42] Praise be to God.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe you are here
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; and there are things you are battling
[2:25:49] with
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; and even as the service is going on
[2:25:54] you
[2:25:57] really. Let me tell you my brother and
[2:25:59] my sister
[2:26:01] inside you
[2:26:03] there is a potential
[2:26:06] there is a limitless power
[2:26:09] which you just don't know
[2:26:12] but if you can activate that
[2:26:15] amen you are more than freemen.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; The Bible say that nature teaches us
[2:26:30] Jesus gave an example.
[2:26:33] He said, "If our father in heaven,
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; he's taking care of sparrows."
[2:26:39] He ask a question. If I also ask you the
[2:26:42] same question,
[2:26:44] how many of you have ever found
[2:26:47] sparrow dead because of
[2:26:58] If God is taking care of bad
[2:27:04] have no sick B.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; BS have no hospitals.
[2:27:27] But can you wonder, do they get sick?
[2:27:31] I think they do.
[2:27:34] Who heals them?
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; If you have veterary doctor, you can
[2:27:41] tell us how many birds have ever treated
[2:27:42] ever since.
[2:27:50] Praise be to God. But it's only
[2:27:53] broilers.
[2:27:56] It's only broilers.
[2:28:10] So if God can take care of birds
[2:28:17] rangers
[2:28:20] are there for buffaloos.
[2:28:28] They are not there bro
[2:28:34] but they knows when they are hurt.
[2:28:42] Have you ever seen a cat eating grass
[2:28:48] or dog?
[2:28:51] Do you know why?
[2:28:56] It's medicine. Eating is medicine.
[2:29:01] If God can take care of this,
[2:29:07] how about us?
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; The things that just simple simple
[2:29:17] things
[2:29:19] which we overlook,
[2:29:22] they become like forgotten beatitudes.
[2:29:30] Blessed be the name of God. But when we
[2:29:33] look at things from that point of view,
[2:29:39] those things make sense.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; We don't need to be miserable.
[2:29:46] God take care of each and every bird,
[2:29:51] each and every animal.
[2:29:54] Ever since he created them,
[2:29:58] God has never went bankrupt.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; Children of Israel in the wilderness 40
[2:30:08] years,
[2:30:11] no changing shoes,
[2:30:14] no changing clothes.
[2:30:20] Probably the clothes would wash
[2:30:22] themselves.
[2:30:26] Hallelujah.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; And that same God is the God we are
[2:30:33] we are serving today.
[2:30:36] Hebrews 13:8.
[2:30:38] It has become a slogan now.
[2:30:41] Jesus Christ the same yesterday.
[2:30:44] Jesus Christ.
[2:30:46] Brethren, this is not mere words.
[2:30:50] The same God, who drive that sun in the
[2:30:53] morning
[2:30:56] who drive the sun in the morning
[2:30:59] and take it the other way in the
[2:31:01] evening.
[2:31:04] That same God
[2:31:07] is the one who gives us life.
[2:31:10] He's our provider.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:31:20] is the one taking care of each one of
[2:31:22] us.
[2:31:25] God is our strength.
[2:31:27] God is our effort. God is our freedom.
[2:31:31] Our healing is our provider.
[2:31:35] Our deliver
[2:31:41] is our everything.
[2:31:43] Our song,
[2:31:45] our effort,
[2:31:47] our health. Our plans
[2:31:51] is our food
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; and he cannot fail us.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Let us not limit his blessings.
[2:32:03] When the Bible say as it was in the days
[2:32:06] of Lord,
[2:32:09] let us not only look at the Sodom side.
[2:32:16] Many time when spoken like that
[2:32:19] people's mind run to homosexual
[2:32:23] moral decay.
[2:32:26] But there is something that was
[2:32:28] happening in that very time.
[2:32:32] When the two angels went to Sodom,
[2:32:35] another angel was with Abra,
[2:32:38] the angel of life.
[2:32:41] He was ministering to Abra
[2:32:44] discerning the heart of Sarah.
[2:32:49] Praise be to God. And the prophet tells
[2:32:52] her the two angels which were to the
[2:32:55] world denomination world.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; And who is the second one?
[2:33:04] Bill.
[2:33:08] But where is the angel of life?
[2:33:12] The end of life is with a bride.
[2:33:15] is deciding the heart of Sarah.
[2:33:19] Amen. Is revealing secret to Abra.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Your wife Sarah
[2:33:29] will give birth to a son.
[2:33:34] That same Jesus,
[2:33:36] he is in the camp tonight.
[2:33:41] Hallelujah. Praise be to God. Let us not
[2:33:44] only look at the negative side.
[2:33:48] Our main interest is in the positive
[2:33:49] side
[2:33:52] that the angel of life is with a bride.
[2:33:57] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:34:01] And when he is with us,
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; can I hide some? Can I hide really
[2:34:06] anything from my friend Abraham?
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I hide this from you, brother?
[2:34:15] Praise be to God. He was discerning.
[2:34:20] He was revealing the secret
[2:34:23] to Abraham.
[2:34:25] Praise be to God. And today, the same
[2:34:28] angel, he is here.
[2:34:34] The one who got the pillar of fire.
[2:34:37] That same angel is here.
[2:34:40] He's discerning the heart. He's
[2:34:44] revealing to your promises.
[2:34:47] He says the Holy Ghost is yours.
[2:34:51] It belongs to you.
[2:34:54] Amen. Is the same God telling us. We are
[2:34:59] free.
[2:35:00] We are not under bondage.
[2:35:03] We are delivered.
[2:35:05] We are delivered sons of God.
[2:35:10] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:35:13] Yes sir. That's why we say we know where
[2:35:17] we are going. We know where we are. We
[2:35:21] know where we came from.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The reason that's why
[2:35:25] believers dagger
[2:35:28] because they forget where they came
[2:35:30] from.
[2:35:33] But if you know that you are once a
[2:35:34] sinner,
[2:35:37] once a slave in the devil's pawn shop,
[2:35:42] they are dying and rotting
[2:35:46] hopeless without God.
[2:35:50] And one day Jesus came your way
[2:35:55] and delivered you out of that house
[2:35:58] remained the same.
[2:36:01] Sir, that can't happen.
[2:36:05] When you look at moral decay in the
[2:36:07] world,
[2:36:09] mothers walking naked.
[2:36:14] Praise be to God. The whole family naked
[2:36:19] like a mother duck leading the duckling.
[2:36:27] No.
[2:36:28] Do you know how the ducks move?
[2:36:32] always move in line.
[2:36:36] It is the mother and the duckling will
[2:36:38] follow.
[2:36:41] We are living in the generation where a
[2:36:43] mother leaves a house
[2:36:46] with a panty
[2:36:50] and the old children
[2:36:53] boys with the damages
[2:36:57] with us.
[2:37:00] Let's go have party.
[2:37:03] Let's go to KFC. KFC.
[2:37:08] But when you you a believer,
[2:37:11] you look at yourself.
[2:37:14] The Bible says the sins of Sodom
[2:37:18] breaks the heart of Lord every day.
[2:37:26] That grace,
[2:37:30] don't take it for granted.
[2:37:36] That grace means a lot.
[2:37:40] If God came down for you,
[2:37:44] just like Abraham,
[2:37:46] he was not better than he was even he
[2:37:49] was worshiping creation.
[2:37:53] He was a moon worshiper.
[2:37:55] But the grace of God found him
[2:37:59] until one day God himself
[2:38:02] came down and met Abra.
[2:38:06] Praise be to God.
[2:38:08] As I'm finishing,
[2:38:17] the prophet says something in this
[2:38:19] message,
[2:38:21] believing God, the only thing keep you
[2:38:24] from being well
[2:38:28] this morning is spirit hanging over you.
[2:38:36] The only thing keeping you dozy
[2:38:41] and feeling out of church
[2:38:46] things are boring you.
[2:38:49] I'm bored.
[2:38:52] I don't even
[2:38:54] time is not moving.
[2:38:58] Even the watch is facing the preachers.
[2:39:05] I switched off the phone. It has a
[2:39:09] you go as if you're going for short call
[2:39:11] but yet you're going to check time.
[2:39:14] He says
[2:39:18] the only thing keep you from being well
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; this morning
[2:39:26] is spirit hanging over you
[2:39:30] that won't uh that won't fully let you
[2:39:35] go out yonder and believe promise that
[2:39:39] that he has done
[2:39:49] Every time you want to hear the word as
[2:39:51] sleep falls on you,
[2:39:55] just check your head.
[2:40:00] You try to listen to pay attention
[2:40:03] to their spirit.
[2:40:05] That's why when the song leader is here,
[2:40:10] brother be in the spirit.
[2:40:17] The song is dancing, jumping
[2:40:20] for you. You are pocketing
[2:40:23] counting the how many lives you have.
[2:40:27] You are just like this.
[2:40:31] There are spirits over you.
[2:40:34] It's not me says the prophet.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; He also looked through this time
[2:40:44] 2026
[2:40:47] and see the spirit hanging over you.
[2:40:57] That is when you remember
[2:41:05] back we need to see sincerely there is a
[2:41:07] spirit hanging over you
[2:41:12] that is right
[2:41:14] and that's then he says
[2:41:18] that won't you let you go beyond God's
[2:41:20] promiseh that is right
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; that is what God gave me.
[2:41:27] It's it is what he give every gospel
[2:41:30] preacher who will believe him the power
[2:41:33] and authority to break that spirit.
[2:41:41] Yes. And that is why I'm rebuking that
[2:41:44] spirit.
[2:41:49] Praise be to God.
[2:41:52] That's why when ministers stand here,
[2:41:56] they don't rebuke you.
[2:41:59] They rebuke the spirit.
[2:42:02] And because you have refused to let the
[2:42:04] spirit go,
[2:42:06] you become annoyed.
[2:42:09] How dare he speaking about me? We have
[2:42:13] no business of speaking about anybody.
[2:42:19] Amen.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; You are our sisters, our brothers.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; But when we are here, we mind the
[2:42:29] father's business.
[2:42:32] And what is that business?
[2:42:34] Saving of souls.
[2:42:36] Rebuking evil spirit, casting them out.
[2:42:41] Amen.
[2:42:43] Declaring the voice.
[2:42:48] the jubilee trumpet
[2:42:50] reminding you who is under bondage
[2:42:55] that is time to go free.
[2:42:59] Every preacher is given that mandate
[2:43:02] young
[2:43:04] sister or brother got that mandate
[2:43:08] to look the devil in the eyes.
[2:43:11] Tell him Satan
[2:43:18] Praise be to God.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; We are here to praise her. You are so
[2:43:24] nice.
[2:43:26] You are smart.
[2:43:32] Yeah, I can see everyone smiling
[2:43:36] and outs say smile for Jesus and find
[2:43:40] for Jesus.
[2:43:42] for Jesus.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus want your worship.
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; He wants your surrender, not your smile.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus says the time has come when the
[2:43:59] true worshippers they will worship him
[2:44:02] in spirit and in the truth.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; And we are the people who have got the
[2:44:09] truth.
[2:44:11] We know when we are worshiped.
[2:44:15] You find them making a very nice prayer
[2:44:20] and they spoil everything
[2:44:23] after praying.
[2:44:25] Then they feel the name of the father,
[2:44:26] son.
[2:44:31] We know much better than that.
[2:44:35] So you always make sure that you break
[2:44:37] that spirit because you have got the
[2:44:38] mandate.
[2:44:43] There are things that we just need to
[2:44:45] think.
[2:44:48] Can't you think really clapping my hand
[2:44:50] my hands to God is wrong?
[2:44:55] Do you need a preacher to first remind
[2:44:57] you
[2:45:00] dancing in the spirit? Do you know that
[2:45:02] even when you are under chain
[2:45:05] do it anyhow
[2:45:08] even when you're not feeling like doing
[2:45:09] it
[2:45:11] do it anyway
[2:45:13] as I was telling you the pull inside us
[2:45:17] I don't think that chain broke when they
[2:45:19] sang the first
[2:45:24] their faith had to be tried
[2:45:28] and maybe that they felt when they are
[2:45:30] so dry.
[2:45:34] Have you ever been so dry to the extent
[2:45:38] that you start praying
[2:45:41] and you first stop
[2:45:43] and you speak to yourself?
[2:45:46] It has ever happened.
[2:45:48] Sometime you wake up in the morning and
[2:45:51] you are dry at 3 in the morning.
[2:45:56] You sing the first song.
[2:45:58] Sometime I sing the first song I first
[2:46:02] seat
[2:46:03] I get the Bible I read a scripture like
[2:46:07] is not entering
[2:46:11] but I just post it anyhow
[2:46:15] I'll sing the first one it's not moving
[2:46:18] I sing the second I sing the third
[2:46:22] before I realize I am worshiping before
[2:46:25] I realize I am praying
[2:46:28] And when I engage that gear,
[2:46:32] that is a dangerous gear.
[2:46:36] Even the devil knows that say not wait
[2:46:39] for him to reach you.
[2:46:42] So many time the kingdom of God has
[2:46:44] suffer.
[2:46:53] Brother, you are going to worship God by
[2:46:55] force.
[2:47:00] will not let you worship.
[2:47:02] He will not let you sing.
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; You have to sing by force, by faith.
[2:47:10] Tell the devil, I will worship God.
[2:47:15] Sometime you clap, you find your hands
[2:47:17] are hurt.
[2:47:21] Those hands are not yours. Therefore,
[2:47:23] God is glory.
[2:47:26] As you are seeing them hands, you are
[2:47:28] seeing the glory of God. You have to
[2:47:31] appreciate God for them.
[2:47:36] Amen.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; That's why for me when I'm woriing, I
[2:47:41] utilize this guy here.
[2:47:44] If he's jumping, I will jump.
[2:47:47] Clapping, I clap like this.
[2:47:50] If he is shouting. If it is crying, I
[2:47:54] will cry.
[2:47:58] such that tomorrow when I have a broken
[2:48:01] leg, I will remind God, give back my leg
[2:48:07] and I jump for you.
[2:48:10] Give back my arms and I clap for you.
[2:48:14] Give back my voice. I shout for you.
[2:48:19] That is what God want.
[2:48:23] But be there reserve yourself.
[2:48:27] It is the devil who is a boss.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; The devil, he always want to be boss.
[2:48:35] When he went to Jesus,
[2:48:37] he told him.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; See, maybe was very smart.
[2:48:44] Yeah, he's a smart guy by the way. So
[2:48:46] cunning,
[2:48:48] smart,
[2:48:50] handsome.
[2:48:51] The devil is not ugly.
[2:48:54] Ah it's very uh beautiful or handsome
[2:49:00] told Jesus
[2:49:02] it is given to me.
[2:49:04] Yeah just it's just a matter of
[2:49:08] because he was not whether he's the son
[2:49:10] of God or
[2:49:15] God disguising simplicity.
[2:49:20] Praise be to God.
[2:49:23] So the devil is the one who always
[2:49:27] the devil wants to to boost and lift
[2:49:30] himself.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; That's why
[2:49:33] that's why the Bible say God hates the
[2:49:35] spirit of pride.
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; For me those people there
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; they think they are spiritual.
[2:49:41] You were you were possessed.
[2:49:46] They think that that's why they cry
[2:49:48] shout for us
[2:49:52] even
[2:49:57] But if she had broken my eyes,
[2:50:01] you have a wrong spirit.
[2:50:07] David danced.
[2:50:09] You dance which can make someone's thro
[2:50:12] go down.
[2:50:15] He was in another dimension.
[2:50:18] Not this power.
[2:50:29] is not even humble
[2:50:33] that you want God to hear. You are just
[2:50:35] say here my humble pride.
[2:50:43] The Bible tells us
[2:50:45] Isaiah chapter 6. When Isaiah got the
[2:50:49] vision, he saw the angels with six wings
[2:50:55] with two wings covering their face,
[2:50:58] two wings covering their face
[2:51:01] and with two
[2:51:03] to wash
[2:51:06] and a sinner saved by grace.
[2:51:13] I am thinking of the rapture.
[2:51:19] Just saying you are thinking of
[2:51:20] jubilation.
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; People were going for rapture.
[2:51:29] There are more sinners than that.
[2:51:33] The Bible says their spirit cries,
[2:51:36] our father
[2:51:39] interceding
[2:51:41] whatever they are doing, they're doing
[2:51:42] with all that
[2:51:45] because they know that the table
[2:51:47] this time is not.
[2:51:50] The devil is so furious
[2:51:53] because his time is now.
[2:51:56] But believers
[2:51:59] who bewished us,
[2:52:03] we have a God,
[2:52:06] who does
[2:52:08] you just think of
[2:52:11] many things.
[2:52:18] I believe even God does surgery on those
[2:52:21] animals when they are sick. He treats
[2:52:24] them.
[2:52:26] take care of them.
[2:52:29] That is the God we are serving.
[2:52:32] We don't know how our body mechanism
[2:52:34] work.
[2:52:37] There is no engineer like God.
[2:52:41] Look at how God engineered your body.
[2:52:46] Smart. He's a smart God.
[2:52:51] Is worthy to of our praise.
[2:52:54] If you look at the way your heart system
[2:52:57] work,
[2:53:00] it's just amazing.
[2:53:03] Is worthy to be praised.
[2:53:09] There's no reason why we don't worship.
[2:53:15] You are leaving home.
[2:53:17] You are praying for one second.
[2:53:20] Father, I thank you. lead me.
[2:53:26] Are those angels your grandparents?
[2:53:30] God lead time.
[2:53:34] Father, I thank you. You've given me the
[2:53:37] grace. You have given me life. Even now
[2:53:40] as I'm moving and what is on my way
[2:53:44] kind Lord
[2:53:46] of me some reverency
[2:53:53] when we're in that kind of atmosphere
[2:53:56] there's no devil and glorify him so
[2:54:03] amen
[2:54:05] to sufficate the devil out of
[2:54:11] Praise be to God.
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; Let us always be in church.
[2:54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:24] &gt;&gt; I'm just picking my heart.
[2:54:30] You see when you look at people who
[2:54:31] worship the devil
[2:54:36] brother,
[2:54:38] they will never miss even a single
[2:54:41] ritual.
[2:54:48] When the witch doctor tells them
[2:54:52] that every night at midnight,
[2:54:57] you go and lie on the graveyard
[2:55:02] for 30 minutes and sec and and 40
[2:55:05] seconds.
[2:55:10] He will not miss us.
[2:55:14] He will
[2:55:18] the eyes will be on the second.
[2:55:22] But our God, it does not rule us in
[2:55:25] fear.
[2:55:28] But God want us to mean business.
[2:55:32] And the prophet tells us when we mean
[2:55:35] business with God
[2:55:38] mean business.
[2:55:46] But believers many times
[2:55:49] you see for I speak these things because
[2:55:51] since my childhood
[2:55:55] I've been in church
[2:55:57] I started on Sunday school
[2:56:01] up to today.
[2:56:03] So there's nothing that young people
[2:56:06] will tell us.
[2:56:13] probably what is more beyond in this age
[2:56:15] that there is a lot of immorality but
[2:56:18] serving moral decay but serving God
[2:56:22] being serious
[2:56:24] is mandate for every believer
[2:56:28] seeking the Holy Spirit
[2:56:30] young people I wonder what you are doing
[2:56:35] I've never heard even one saying
[2:56:38] I'm seeking the Holy Spirit
[2:56:41] Brother, I'm praying God.
[2:56:43] I want to get deeper in Christ.
[2:56:46] Maybe they go to pastor.
[2:56:50] If you are there, God bless you.
[2:56:58] How can I? You are in your holidays.
[2:57:02] You spend seven days.
[2:57:04] You want to be on church during service
[2:57:06] day.
[2:57:08] You are not working. You're not doing
[2:57:10] anything. You're at home playing chess.
[2:57:16] Can't you use that time to serve?
[2:57:19] Can't you go before the altar,
[2:57:27] where your heart is,
[2:57:30] where your treasure is, that's where
[2:57:32] your heart is.
[2:57:36] If our heart is in God,
[2:57:39] we will be on our knees.
[2:57:42] I challenge the young people.
[2:57:46] Use this time, these holy days to seek
[2:57:50] the Holy Spirit.
[2:57:55] Says, "Man does not seek God. God
[2:57:56] seeks."
[2:58:00] Why did Jesus go to the mountain?
[2:58:05] He would have sat at Joseph's house
[2:58:08] say my father you come here
[2:58:12] he went there in prayer
[2:58:16] and the reason that's why you're not
[2:58:17] praying it's because you are sinning
[2:58:22] because the sinning man will stop to
[2:58:24] pray
[2:58:27] man will stop to sin
[2:58:29] you want to stop to sin
[2:58:33] Practice prayer.
[2:58:36] Read the word.
[2:58:38] Are you listening to the message
[2:58:42] or you are reading magazine?
[2:58:46] Utilize your holidays.
[2:58:49] We want testimonies.
[2:58:52] God filling me with the Holy Spirit.
[2:58:54] I was praying, meditating on God. I was
[2:58:58] at church. I was in the bush somewhere.
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, we used to go to bush.
[2:59:06] We used to go to Bon to abandoned
[2:59:08] houses.
[2:59:10] Me personally been to several new sites
[2:59:15] praying.
[2:59:17] Not because I'm better than anyone,
[2:59:20] but we need more of God
[2:59:23] to overcome this generation.
[2:59:26] Our God is limitless.
[2:59:29] And our prophet told us
[2:59:32] we just need to press on.
[2:59:40] But say that any believer that has got
[2:59:41] the Holy Spirit, you have you have the
[2:59:44] power of God within you or the authority
[2:59:46] to pray the prayer of faith.
[2:59:56] You hear that?
[2:59:58] But what if if you don't have the Holy
[3:00:00] Spirit?
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; The son had the same authority to write
[3:00:05] a check and his dad as his dad. And if
[3:00:09] he fired a man, he was fired. If he
[3:00:12] hired a man, he was hired.
[3:00:20] Exercise
[3:00:26] your authority.
[3:00:33] Don't think chasing demons is for elders
[3:00:35] alone. No brother,
[3:00:38] even a 13y old child,
[3:00:41] even seveny old child
[3:00:44] when he or she knows what she's doing,
[3:00:47] the devil cannot stand.
[3:00:50] Don't you admire these things?
[3:00:53] Exercising authority.
[3:00:57] If you hear a demon strangling a
[3:00:59] neighbor,
[3:01:07] what's the problem?
[3:01:13] You devil,
[3:01:15] you go waste our time.
[3:01:21] Brother,
[3:01:22] &gt;&gt; don't look for brother Julius's phone
[3:01:24] number.
[3:01:26] The other scripture that says you shall
[3:01:28] cast out demons in
[3:01:34] those are your pistols.
[3:01:39] You know pistols are not meant for war.
[3:01:43] It's just for self-defense.
[3:01:46] So your self-defense
[3:01:49] are those scriptures
[3:01:54] on his name.
[3:01:59] Praise be to God.
[3:02:02] Walk with your person.
[3:02:05] You find a demon disturbing just
[3:02:13] make Those
[3:02:17] are the few pistols we move with around.
[3:02:21] God bless you
[3:02:26] precious father in the name of Jesus.
[3:02:29] We thank you Lord for this afternoon.
[3:02:32] We thank you for the word this evening.
[3:02:36] It's our desire Lord.
[3:02:38] always remind us of our duty,
[3:02:41] responsibility
[3:02:43] and of us knowing who you are that you
[3:02:46] are more than able to help us
[3:02:49] out of all our troubles.
[3:02:52] Father, even now, your word has gone
[3:02:54] forth. But prayer, Lord Jesus,
[3:02:58] said that which is not right, I pray
[3:03:01] that you uproot it, Lord. And Lord
[3:03:04] Jesus, may the Holy Spirit water your
[3:03:08] word. And may this word bring forth life
[3:03:11] in us because we know the devil does not
[3:03:15] fear us because we know how to speak.
[3:03:18] Fear us when we live the life.
[3:03:22] It's our desire for each one of us. Give
[3:03:25] us the grace to live the life of God
[3:03:28] because we cannot do without the Lord
[3:03:31] Jesus. We are depending in time.
[3:03:35] You started with us. You see us through.
[3:03:38] Father, we bless you. Worship you Christ
[3:03:42] in Jesus name.
[3:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Lord bless you. Shall we stand
[3:03:49] on our feet?
[3:03:57] There is a saying that all all of us
[3:03:59] know that say that action speaks louder
[3:04:01] than words.
[3:04:06] Even when we are worshiping,
[3:04:10] our action speaks louder than that.
[3:04:16] And I just believe I believe that God
[3:04:18] looks at our action
[3:04:22] and is more interested in our action
[3:04:26] than our singing.
[3:04:30] Praise be to God.
[3:04:32] I not preach to hurt anyone of you
[3:04:38] but I I trust I was just speaking the
[3:04:40] truth.
[3:04:43] &gt;&gt; God deserve our respect.
[3:04:48] Yeah. Because sometime we do things
[3:04:50] which we cannot even do to our earthly
[3:04:51] parents.
[3:04:55] But God is more more is much more than
[3:04:58] that.
[3:05:01] Yeah. May God bless you,
[3:05:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to invite brother Shalom. But
[3:05:05] may before I invite him,
[3:05:09] &gt;&gt; we are in uh we are we've just finished

[3:05:20] to kindly be careful where you go,
[3:05:25] where you are moving.

[3:05:30] time of uh internet shutdown.

[3:05:39] Always be vigilant.

[3:05:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's a lot of tension.
[3:05:53] This is not to scare you
[3:05:56] but just for you to be mindful.
