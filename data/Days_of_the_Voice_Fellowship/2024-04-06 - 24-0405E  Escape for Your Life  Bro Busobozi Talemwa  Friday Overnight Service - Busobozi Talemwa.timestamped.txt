[1:19:02] trouble of introducing myself to anyone

[1:20:13] message Escape for your
[1:20:17] life hopefully it will be short and then
[1:20:19] we will go to
[1:20:22] prayer I just feel to for spend some
[1:20:25] time in prayer the Lord willing
[1:20:28] tonight so um I I love the scripture
[1:20:33] that we ended with the verses that we
[1:20:35] ended with
[1:20:38] here where he
[1:20:40] says uh when the angel of course we know
[1:20:44] that it began with the god meeting the
[1:20:47] the
[1:20:51] Abraham when the Three Angels went to
[1:20:53] meet Abraham
[1:20:56] and of course one of them we know was
[1:20:57] the
[1:20:58] Lord and the two went to Sodom and
[1:21:02] gomorra now lot was Abra Abraham's uh
[1:21:06] brother
[1:21:09] brother and you remember time came when
[1:21:12] God when God called
[1:21:15] Abraham Abraham went with
[1:21:18] Lord and because Abraham went with
[1:21:23] lot God did not appear again to
[1:21:27] Abraham and many times in our life we
[1:21:30] take many Lots with
[1:21:34] us you know the Lord here is talking
[1:21:38] about the excesses in
[1:21:42] life that God did not need to get you
[1:21:46] from the place where you were to the
[1:21:48] place where he
[1:21:52] wants and many times we hold on
[1:21:56] them because of our relationship and
[1:21:59] time that we've spent with
[1:22:01] it and we kind of things that we cannot
[1:22:04] do without those
[1:22:07] things sometimes it is even people in
[1:22:09] our
[1:22:10] life that we want to hold on and tie
[1:22:13] ourself
[1:22:15] on and we think that we cannot do
[1:22:17] without
[1:22:19] them let me begin right there and tell
[1:22:21] you that you can you can do without
[1:22:23] anyone
[1:22:27] you did not hear that I said you can do
[1:22:29] without
[1:22:31] anyone but you cannot do without
[1:22:34] God so we notice that you see Abraham
[1:22:37] tied himself with
[1:22:39] Lord and Abraham had a good reason for
[1:22:43] that because lot lot was his
[1:22:46] cousin he was a son of his
[1:22:49] uncle and uh and uh you know he noticed
[1:22:53] that uh
[1:22:55] you know he was a son of um his uncle
[1:22:59] his brother brother his
[1:23:02] brother yes yes and and so um we notice
[1:23:07] that the father of Lord had
[1:23:10] died and I want you to imagine you have
[1:23:13] your
[1:23:15] cousin and his father is
[1:23:18] dead and and your father is also
[1:23:22] dead and now now you you God tells you
[1:23:26] to move from one place to go to a far
[1:23:31] country it is difficult for you to just
[1:23:33] abandon your
[1:23:37] family so you would feel it is only fair
[1:23:40] to go with
[1:23:42] them so there are certain things that
[1:23:45] when God called
[1:23:48] you you thought you felt pity for some
[1:23:52] of those
[1:23:53] things and you wanted to go with
[1:23:56] them and you wanted to carry them with
[1:23:59] you maybe it is a little bit
[1:24:02] heavier maybe it is a little
[1:24:05] habit maybe it is something small not so
[1:24:08] big and you felt P for that thing and he
[1:24:12] wanted it to go with
[1:24:14] you and you were right here complaining
[1:24:17] a lot that God is not speaking to
[1:24:19] you you are not going to the next level
[1:24:23] you're struggling with
[1:24:25] you want to hear the voice of God you
[1:24:27] are hearing people you know giving
[1:24:29] testimonies how God visits them and how
[1:24:31] God has spoken to
[1:24:34] them but when it comes to you you've not
[1:24:37] experienced that well I tell you it is
[1:24:40] because of that La that you have kept in
[1:24:42] your
[1:24:43] life and sometimes it comes to that
[1:24:46] moment where we need to let go of
[1:24:49] Lord when you let go of
[1:24:52] Lord then you are ready to from
[1:24:55] God but if you hold on to
[1:24:58] Lord the longer you hold on to him the
[1:25:02] longer you will wait to hear from the
[1:25:05] from you see you know you know time came
[1:25:08] when Abraham had to make a
[1:25:11] decision and Abraham said to Lord you
[1:25:15] know now my
[1:25:16] brother you are going to choose the
[1:25:20] place where you are going to
[1:25:21] go you are going to either choose
[1:25:25] to go north and if you choose North I
[1:25:28] will go
[1:25:29] south if you choose if you choose East I
[1:25:34] go looked
[1:25:37] around everywhere was
[1:25:44] Village and when he looked the other
[1:25:47] side I think it was south or something
[1:25:49] like
[1:25:50] that he saw a beautiful city
[1:25:55] he told his brother let me go to that
[1:25:58] City lot loved
[1:26:01] cities but you know many times cities
[1:26:03] are synonymous with
[1:26:07] sin that is true City C is usually and
[1:26:12] civilization is synonymous with
[1:26:15] sin because this is not God is
[1:26:20] civilization God civilization is coming
[1:26:23] in the millennium
[1:26:27] ciz calls it
[1:26:32] saten all the construction
[1:26:35] projects the money the
[1:26:38] aircraft you know the big farmer
[1:26:40] Industries
[1:26:42] and schools and you know brother bam
[1:26:46] says it's all of the
[1:26:48] devil so really what we what we know as
[1:26:51] good
[1:26:53] life most of it or all of it today is
[1:26:59] controlled by
[1:27:00] Satan where are the big
[1:27:03] monies you're going to find it in
[1:27:05] politics you're going to find it in big
[1:27:09] Industries I've had I've had many
[1:27:12] believers who have had to quit certain
[1:27:15] jobs because they felt they were being
[1:27:20] compromised some of them were
[1:27:23] threatened you cannot stay here and you
[1:27:25] don't do what I tell you to
[1:27:29] do sometimes you know even their bosses
[1:27:31] they top
[1:27:33] bosses they will tell them you know you
[1:27:35] have to do it this
[1:27:37] way yes I know it is supposed to be
[1:27:40] 10,000 but I want you to sign for
[1:27:43] 50,000 and if you don't then it's going
[1:27:47] to be difficult with you
[1:27:49] here and and this is the systems that we
[1:27:52] have the whole thing is red to
[1:27:56] the you know that life and the world as
[1:27:58] we know
[1:27:59] it let me tell it is going to come to a
[1:28:03] time where it will be very difficult for
[1:28:07] a true genuine
[1:28:09] believer comfortably live in this
[1:28:13] world I believe this is where it is
[1:28:16] hied you know um you know the world as
[1:28:20] we see it as you know we know
[1:28:23] it is setting us up for a
[1:28:27] trap our home is not here our home is
[1:28:32] above and the real true Sons and
[1:28:34] Daughters of
[1:28:35] God not be seeing how you know to build
[1:28:39] and stay
[1:28:41] here how to accumulate and stay
[1:28:45] here they should be trying to look to
[1:28:47] see how we should work him in our
[1:28:50] salvation with fear and trembling that
[1:28:51] we will get out of here
[1:28:57] there are people who are ready to do
[1:28:58] anything and everything to attain this
[1:29:00] world the world's
[1:29:05] riches the money in the
[1:29:07] world the good life as they call

[1:29:27] girlfriends many boyfriends you know
[1:29:29] doing the things that the world the
[1:29:31] people in the world
[1:29:32] do the world has its own
[1:29:36] definition of what good life is but I
[1:29:39] will tell you good
[1:29:41] life is receiving the word of God in its
[1:29:47] entirety accepting the word of God and
[1:29:49] submitting yourself to
[1:29:51] it l when we submit ourself to the
[1:29:55] word it means we are ready to change
[1:29:58] everything and anything in our life to
[1:30:00] align ourself with the word of
[1:30:06] God the heart that God
[1:30:09] loves the heart that is willing to
[1:30:12] escape the heart that is willing to
[1:30:15] run whenever God comes down God

[1:31:05] Heaven whenever God comes
[1:31:07] down to any of us he comes to snatch us
[1:31:13] out he comes to snatch us out that's why
[1:31:17] the Rapture is going to be a snatching
[1:31:20] away the is going to be a catching
[1:31:22] away it's not a SL taking
[1:31:25] away it's not a SL of a change of the
[1:31:28] body the Bible tells us the Rapture is a

[1:31:35] body in the twinkling of an
[1:31:38] eye in the twinkling of ey if you are
[1:31:41] not changed if you not

[1:32:03] greatest Escape there has ever

[1:32:50] your
[1:32:51] demons if you play around with the
[1:32:53] spirits that are you every day you will
[1:32:56] be left

[1:32:59] and come in the church at
[1:33:02] night we escaping for our
[1:33:06] Liv it's not a joke Christianity is not
[1:33:09] a joke it's not a joking matter and
[1:33:14] a you it's not playing
[1:33:17] Church meing
[1:33:19] business I'm going to show you something
[1:33:22] here amen that amen salvation and
[1:33:25] serving God is escaping for your
[1:33:30] life Escape is not something you just
[1:33:34] do Escape you have to plan
[1:33:37] it Escape you have to know what you're
[1:33:40] doing esape you have to know where you
[1:33:42] are
[1:33:44] going esape you have to know what you're
[1:33:47] losing you have to know what you're
[1:33:49] running away
[1:33:50] from you have to know what your heart
[1:33:52] desires
[1:33:55] you also have to know the
[1:33:57] consequences there are many
[1:33:59] consequences but you are ready for
[1:34:01] whatever will
[1:34:03] come how many are ready for whatever
[1:34:05] will come you to escape for your
[1:34:11] life am I preaching to Believers this
[1:34:14] night and so when God told
[1:34:18] Abraham go away from your people God
[1:34:21] meant it and Abraham is
[1:34:25] and but he went with Lord and when we
[1:34:27] reached somewhere with Lord and they
[1:34:28] decided to to
[1:34:31] separate it was painful for
[1:34:34] Abraham sometimes you have to painfully
[1:34:36] separate from people and from
[1:34:41] things because if you do
[1:34:44] not you cannot
[1:34:48] Escape can I have somebody saying Amen
[1:34:52] to it is it has to be
[1:34:56] painful
[1:35:00] not you have to make up your
[1:35:02] mind you have to agree with
[1:35:05] yourself and agree with the word of God
[1:35:08] to separate
[1:35:11] yourself and he told he told he told he
[1:35:14] told uh you know his brother his
[1:35:16] cousin go whever and he chose the
[1:35:19] city and later on we
[1:35:22] see you know this man loved City so
[1:35:25] much but let's let's follow it along
[1:35:29] here so after after
[1:35:32] Abraham you know met rather met with the
[1:35:37] angel he made a
[1:35:40] deal you know Abraham was telling God
[1:35:42] you know you cannot destroy that
[1:35:45] City you know Abraham rather God
[1:35:48] revealed everything he was planning to
[1:35:49] do to
[1:35:52] Abraham Abraham is the type of the
[1:35:56] bride and let me tell you there is
[1:35:58] nothing that God can do and will do to
[1:36:00] the world without fast revealing it to
[1:36:02] the
[1:36:06] bride we are his
[1:36:09] beloved and everything major that will
[1:36:11] happen he has revealed to the bride
[1:36:16] first so the Rapture is not going to
[1:36:19] happen when I'm still here I will know
[1:36:20] when it is happening and I will go
[1:36:26] why because I'm his
[1:36:28] bride and we see that Lord Abraham got a
[1:36:31] chance to know
[1:36:34] everything it was Abraham that was
[1:36:36] interceding for the people in
[1:36:40] Sodom we are the people that must
[1:36:42] intercede for the people
[1:36:46] inia that is why we are
[1:36:48] here we must intercede for our
[1:36:51] Des maybe the
[1:36:54] someone why did God destroy
[1:36:57] Sodom because there was
[1:37:00] someone why is the rapture not happening
[1:37:03] today because there is someone out there
[1:37:07] what are you doing about it the is not
[1:37:10] happening because God knows there is
[1:37:12] someone
[1:37:14] there and when someone is still there
[1:37:17] that is supposed to be in here the
[1:37:20] Rapture will not
[1:37:21] happen it doesn't matter how much you
[1:37:24] are
[1:37:25] ready the rapor will not happen until
[1:37:28] everyone that was
[1:37:30] predestinated will come out and who is
[1:37:34] to intercede for
[1:37:35] them the bride us we intered by
[1:37:40] prayer amen that's why the prayer of
[1:37:43] Believers must always include
[1:37:45] interceding and praying for the
[1:37:50] unbelievers praying for the sinners
[1:37:54] praying for those who have rejected the
[1:37:55] word praying for the people in the
[1:37:59] denominations praying for those who
[1:38:00] canot accept the
[1:38:02] word let me tell you we are in a
[1:38:06] final it is real
[1:38:10] friends I can even say that because I've
[1:38:12] been in
[1:38:16] Europe

[1:38:20] son came from the East and on to the
[1:38:26] west and from the

[1:48:35] anymore when they come to church they're
[1:48:37] waiting for the time when the preacher

[2:16:04] send
[2:16:07] someone my

[2:16:22] him
[2:16:24] they have
[2:16:28] Moses they have William
[2:16:30] Bram and the
[2:16:32] prophets and the preachers and their
[2:16:37] pastors let them hear
[2:16:40] them if you don't hear what I'm
[2:16:42] preaching to
[2:16:43] you God will not send an angel to
[2:16:46] you I am to you
[2:16:49] now
[2:16:51] there's no other angel coming from
[2:16:54] heaven I'm speaking to you
[2:16:59] sister
[2:17:01] no if God wants to speak to you sends a
[2:17:05] man your
[2:17:08] brother the question is will you
[2:17:11] hear say he's preaching that because he
[2:17:13] knows
[2:17:17] me that's up to you it's up to you
[2:17:23] God has his way of
[2:17:25] working he sends a man from your people
[2:17:30] from among your
[2:17:32] people and he says
[2:17:36] if he said and he said n Father Abraham
[2:17:40] but if one went out unto them from the
[2:17:45] dead they will
[2:17:48] repent this man is saying
[2:17:51] my brother's hearts are very
[2:17:55] hard but if they see someone coming from
[2:17:57] the
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:02] dead
[2:18:05] who if the ground would
[2:18:10] open and Moses comes
[2:18:16] out even the one who was
[2:18:18] doing you be the first to see the
[2:18:25] that's what Lazarus that's what the man
[2:18:27] was
[2:18:30] saying those people are hard
[2:18:34] Hearts send someone from
[2:18:41] hell if you can't hear
[2:18:43] me if an angel came from Heaven you
[2:18:48] can't if your heart is so
[2:18:52] hard that preachers will preach and you
[2:18:54] can't
[2:18:55] change even if Jesus himself came here
[2:18:58] you can never
[2:19:03] change losing your
[2:19:11] heart if they
[2:19:13] hear not
[2:19:16] Moses and the
[2:19:18] prophets neither will they be pers
[2:19:23] through the one that Rose from
[2:19:27] thead I love to
[2:19:30] continue but at this moment I want us to
[2:19:33] think about those
[2:19:38] words it's time for us to escape for our
