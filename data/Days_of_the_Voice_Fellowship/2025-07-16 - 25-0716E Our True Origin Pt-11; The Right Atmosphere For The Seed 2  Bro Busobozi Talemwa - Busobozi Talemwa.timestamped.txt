[47:18] this side to please come this side.
[47:24] Um,
[47:27] I just want to before we go to the
[47:29] preaching of the word today,
[47:32] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to give you a little bit
[47:34] of an update,
[47:38] especially those who missed who didn't
[47:41] give a get a chance to go with us.
[47:46] Brother Marvin, do we have the photos
[47:48] ready?
[47:49] Brother Isaac, if you can also show
[47:51] those who
[47:55] Uh you can see that we had maybe we had
[47:58] a good representation from the church.
[48:02] I think about 40 or 50 we were able to
[48:04] make it
[48:06] and as you can see we had we we stormed
[48:10] the whole place
[48:13] and I'm sure that the neighbors did not
[48:15] expect
[48:18] after
[48:21] people coming out
[48:23] you know uh and and we just seized the
[48:26] whole place
[48:28] and we went there and had some good time
[48:30] of prayer.
[48:33] You have more pictures, brother. You
[48:34] only had one picture.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Just give us as many as you have.
[48:39] Come on.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, that's brother Dan there.
[48:43] And you can see everybody smiling.
[48:46] You know, footstep is possession.
[48:50] We stepped in that place and we claimed
[48:53] it. We believe it is ours.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Come on. Give me more
[48:59] pictures. Ah. Oh, you're done. All
[49:03] right. I don't know how many brother
[49:05] Isaac had and how many
[49:08] I did not prepare them earlier, but I
[49:10] told them on the last minute that they
[49:12] should make some some photos ready to
[49:15] show us.
[49:17] So um those of you who went to that
[49:20] place,
[49:22] I know you already happy
[49:25] and um we had already done some initial
[49:28] due diligence.
[49:33] I don't know how you would want to say
[49:34] that in Uganda
[49:36] due diligence is what you do to ensure
[49:38] that what you are buying is legitimate.
[49:49] I'm glad that uh we we have brother
[49:52] Neville here, a lawyer.
[49:56] I'm sorry, brother Neville. I never
[49:57] meant to give you away today.
[50:02] You know, he went an extra mile of doing
[50:05] um searches. We we did searches
[50:09] in the land in the lands
[50:12] and also um you know whatever is
[50:16] required to ensure that we are the land
[50:18] we are we are embarking on buying is
[50:20] legitimate
[50:26] and I'm glad to inform you that we found
[50:27] that the land is legitimate.
[50:33] Amen. and u you know whoever reaches
[50:36] there is just excited.
[50:40] So um as as as I informed you on Sunday,
[50:43] it still stands.
[50:47] Um only that the the good news that I
[50:50] have
[50:52] after the announcement on on of Sunday,
[50:56] we had two among us.
[50:59] [Music]
[51:01] One one brother said, "Well, before the
[51:03] end of the week, he's going to get two
[51:05] million views."
[51:09] and uh and uh one sister
[51:13] she spoke when everybody was there
[51:15] listening
[51:17] but because we are streaming I don't
[51:18] know whether she wants me to mention her
[51:19] name
[51:22] she said she she's going to you know
[51:25] what do you call the old people's
[51:26] savings
[51:30] take 500,000 shillings out of it
[51:34] [Music]
[51:36] give it towards the land fund
[51:39] I think uh those uh those are real
[51:42] sacrifices
[51:45] and God is pleased with sacrifices like
[51:47] that
[51:50] and so that reduces the the the because
[51:53] we needed about 6 how much data
[51:57] 6 something
[51:59] that we are remaining with
[52:06] to be able to hit 100 million
[52:10] And uh that's what we need to give as a
[52:12] down payment.
[52:15] I know there are many questions
[52:18] how we going to do that how
[52:20] you know we are doing things by faith
[52:24] not by sight.
[52:26] What I know that we ought to do,
[52:29] if we are moving by faith,
[52:32] just keep moving.
[52:35] Don't stay in one place.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; And the way you do that is by giving
[52:39] what you have.
[52:42] The Lord will multiply.
[52:44] Every one of you has something.
[52:47] And even those of you following us
[52:48] online,
[52:50] this ministry is a blessing to you.
[52:53] Don't just take the spiritual benefits.
[52:57] You also tap
[53:00] in the physical benefits
[53:03] by giving you receive.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I know that we have groups
[53:10] and maybe brother Isaac can also put up
[53:12] those groups the contact for the if you
[53:14] want to join a group.
[53:21] Please join
[53:23] and let's do this together.
[53:26] Amen. Amen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; We are going to the book of Luke today
[53:35] and we are reading out of Luke chapter 8
[53:41] is what we read on Sunday.
[53:44] So this is a continuation the right
[53:46] atmosphere part two
[53:49] [Music]
[53:51] still dealing with the our true origin.
[53:58] How many are being blessed on this
[53:59] series?
[54:02] Amen.
[54:08] We are reading out of Luke chapter 8.
[54:14] I'm going to read from verses 4
[54:18] to to 8 and then we'll be seated. We can
[54:21] read the rest afterwards.
[54:28] And when much people were gathered
[54:29] together and were come to him out of
[54:32] every city, he spake by a parable. A saw
[54:36] went out to sow his seed, and he as he
[54:38] sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it
[54:41] was trotten down, and the fowls of the
[54:43] air devoured, and some fell upon a rock,
[54:46] and as
[54:48] And as soon as it was sprung up, it
[54:51] withered away because it lacked
[54:53] moisture. And some fell among thorns,
[54:55] and the thorns sprung up with it, and
[54:57] choked it. And others fell on good
[54:59] ground, and sprung up, and bear fruit
[55:02] and hundfold. And when he had said these
[55:05] things, he cried. He And he that has
[55:10] ears,
[55:12] uh, excuse me. And when he had said
[55:15] these things, he cried. He that has ears
[55:17] to hear, let him hear.
[55:26] Foreign
[55:33] [Music]
[55:39] [Music]
[55:41] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[56:08] [Music]
[56:12] Amen. You may be seated, please.
[56:16] Amen.
[56:21] Happy to see uh Mrs. Allan here today.
[56:25] God bless you. Alan to see you brother
[56:28] Peter.
[56:30] Some of these faces are very rare in
[56:32] church on such a day. So
[56:37] when I see you here
[56:40] God bless you all.
[56:43] Amen. Amen. Uh how many have come tired?
[56:49] How many have come hungry?
[56:52] How many are ready to feast on the word?
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] Brother Amram, I'm happy to see you. I
[56:59] thought you wouldn't make it tonight.
[57:00] Wonderful.
[57:03] Amen. Now, um I'm I'm we're dealing with
[57:05] part two
[57:08] on this on this sub subtopic,
[57:13] the right atmosphere.
[57:16] Friends, we are dealing with a very
[57:19] important subject
[57:22] and uh it has personally blessed my
[57:24] heart
[57:27] really really so much
[57:30] and as you know you get deeper in you
[57:32] know studying the message
[57:36] you realize indeed it is honey in the
[57:38] rock.
[57:41] It is honey in the rock.
[57:44] Um but sadly
[57:47] very few so-called Bible believers read
[57:50] the Bible.
[57:56] Very few. Very few message believers
[58:00] read the message.
[58:03] And that is the problem.
[58:07] That is the problem. But if we were able
[58:10] to read the Bible
[58:13] like feast on it, study it
[58:16] and put it on our daily um you know menu
[58:23] able to study the message.
[58:26] I can assure you we would be different
[58:29] quality of believers.
[58:34] Many of the things that we are
[58:36] struggling with in our in this life,
[58:40] we would overcome them without even
[58:42] praying.
[58:48] And that is the truth.
[58:50] That's the truth. Because you see, a
[58:54] child being a child can only survive by
[58:59] begging his father and mother.
[59:05] That is how a child can survive.
[59:08] Because he's a child, he knows no
[59:11] better.
[59:13] He doesn't have a backbone to live on by
[59:16] himself.
[59:19] He can only depend on the good graces of
[59:21] the mother or the father
[59:26] because he's a child. That's all he
[59:28] knows how to do
[59:30] is to ask. Okay. And many and depending
[59:34] on their age,
[59:36] sometimes if they're younger, they don't
[59:37] even know how to talk, so they just cry.
[59:42] Brother Bham says the only way a child
[59:44] can know can demand for what she or they
[59:48] want is to cry for it.
[59:54] You see, because he's a child. But as
[59:56] this child grows,
[59:58] there are different seasons and stages
[1:00:00] of growth, maturity,
[1:00:04] The child one time will learn to know
[1:00:07] that not everything that they want they
[1:00:10] will get from the father.
[1:00:16] At a certain age, this child will
[1:00:18] understand. There are certain things I
[1:00:19] have to ask my father and there are
[1:00:21] certain things I have to you know find
[1:00:23] means to acquire.
[1:00:29] Then you know as this child grows this
[1:00:31] child becomes an adult.
[1:00:35] That's what you now call reaching
[1:00:37] maturity.
[1:00:40] And now when a child has reached
[1:00:41] maturity,
[1:00:43] he's no longer going to be asking
[1:00:45] anything from the father
[1:00:49] because it's no longer now about the
[1:00:50] father.
[1:00:53] It's about him.
[1:00:56] Because whatever the father is,
[1:00:59] when this child has reached maturity,
[1:01:02] they have gained,
[1:01:05] they have learned
[1:01:08] how to acquire things the way the father
[1:01:11] acquires things.
[1:01:15] And so then they will acquire those
[1:01:17] things.
[1:01:19] They will know how does the father
[1:01:21] acquire it.
[1:01:23] Then they have read the land because
[1:01:25] they have come to maturity.
[1:01:29] And you see that's why you know adoption
[1:01:33] is being blessed as a son
[1:01:38] not a young son or child
[1:01:44] son daughter of God.
[1:01:48] So it's no longer here ye God.
[1:01:53] Now hear ye him
[1:01:58] the son. You remember that voice which
[1:02:01] was which happened when Jesus was being
[1:02:03] baptized.
[1:02:05] This is my beloved son
[1:02:09] in in whom
[1:02:14] I am pleased.
[1:02:17] So now where was the father?
[1:02:19] The father was now embodied in the son.
[1:02:24] The authority of the father was now in
[1:02:27] the son.
[1:02:30] The ability of the father was now in the
[1:02:32] son.
[1:02:35] So now the voice did not say here ye me
[1:02:39] but he said hear ye
[1:02:42] because he now was speaking on behalf of
[1:02:44] the father.
[1:02:47] And that's why he he looked at the
[1:02:49] Pharisees and he told them that the
[1:02:51] father is in me and I am in him.
[1:02:57] And he said, I do only the will of my
[1:02:58] father.
[1:03:01] What I have learned of him,
[1:03:05] you know, what I I see of him. So
[1:03:09] because he has come into that place
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:12] as a as a as an adopted son.
[1:03:17] And we as believers,
[1:03:19] we many times we we live like babies,
[1:03:24] we live like children and many times we
[1:03:27] are overcome by certain things in our
[1:03:29] Christian walk
[1:03:32] because we are still babies.
[1:03:36] We are still children. We are still
[1:03:37] young
[1:03:38] and everything everything we have to run
[1:03:40] to the father.
[1:03:42] We cry like babies.
[1:03:45] But you see we we don't grow.
[1:03:49] Why we don't grow? You find that there
[1:03:51] something same same thing you were
[1:03:53] praying about 5 years ago.
[1:03:58] You are praying about it 5 years later.
[1:04:02] Same thing. The same demons which were
[1:04:05] defeating you 5 years ago
[1:04:09] are the same even now.
[1:04:11] It means there is a problem somewhere.
[1:04:15] There is a problem somewhere and I can
[1:04:17] tell you that problem is not God
[1:04:21] because everything that God had to do
[1:04:23] for us he has already done. Hallelujah.
[1:04:29] There is no more coming for you.
[1:04:32] He has done it all. And he said it is
[1:04:35] finished. So now what is remaining
[1:04:39] is for you, for me
[1:04:42] to grow to such a stature
[1:04:47] of a man that is perfect,
[1:04:51] thoroughly furnished,
[1:04:55] wanting nothing.
[1:04:57] You cannot grow into that place of
[1:04:59] position
[1:05:02] without attaining
[1:05:05] uh what God has intentionally intended
[1:05:08] for you to attain
[1:05:13] and that is it comes by none other thing
[1:05:16] but by the word.
[1:05:21] It comes only by the word. So I want to
[1:05:24] challenge you.
[1:05:26] I want to challenge us and I'll keep
[1:05:28] challenging you
[1:05:31] brethren. Let us learn
[1:05:34] to feed on the word
[1:05:37] as individuals,
[1:05:40] not as a church.
[1:05:43] This this is something that you have to
[1:05:44] do as an individual if you believe your
[1:05:47] rapture material.
[1:05:51] That is why the rapture of the Gentiles
[1:05:56] is not going to be a group thing.
[1:06:00] Maybe this may disappoint some of you
[1:06:03] but we are not going to be raptured as a
[1:06:05] church
[1:06:08] that now DVF is your church.
[1:06:12] No, the Bible says two will be in bed,
[1:06:17] one shall be taken, one will remain. Two
[1:06:21] will be in the field, one shall be
[1:06:23] taken, one will remain. Two shall be,
[1:06:26] you know, different times.
[1:06:31] In Australia, it's a different time.
[1:06:32] Australia, in America, it's a different
[1:06:34] time. You know, in Canada, different
[1:06:37] Africa different, Europe different. He's
[1:06:40] showing you that this is going to be
[1:06:41] something that will happen all over the
[1:06:42] world.
[1:06:45] The translation of the saints,
[1:06:48] it will happen at the same time.
[1:06:51] in different time zones
[1:06:55] and it will not be a group taken at a
[1:06:57] go.
[1:06:59] It will be an individual experience.
[1:07:04] So we are going to you are going to be
[1:07:05] translated as an individual.
[1:07:09] If if you you you came to that to
[1:07:11] maturity,
[1:07:13] you cannot harvest
[1:07:16] a seed which is still eh green.
[1:07:20] young.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; You can only harvest a a riapen seed of
[1:07:26] fruit.
[1:07:28] It has to ripen first and then you
[1:07:31] harvest it and you take it into the the
[1:07:33] bank. So he is coming back for a church
[1:07:36] that has ripened,
[1:07:40] not a younger church, a church which is
[1:07:43] young and still feeding on me.
[1:07:47] is coming for a a a grown church.
[1:07:52] Let me put it this way. An adult church,
[1:07:56] a church that is no longer feeding on
[1:07:58] the miracle of the world,
[1:08:01] but a church that is feeding on the meat
[1:08:03] of the world.
[1:08:07] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:08:09] There are many things that I would want
[1:08:10] to say,
[1:08:12] but because we have limited time,
[1:08:15] allow me to stick with my notes today.
[1:08:19] And so, we've been talking about the
[1:08:22] seed.
[1:08:24] And how you are the seed,
[1:08:28] you are the seed of God. Of course, you
[1:08:31] remember we started with with speaking
[1:08:33] of those that he forneew.
[1:08:37] He also predestinated.
[1:08:39] But you see, when did he know them? They
[1:08:42] were in his mind before the foundation
[1:08:44] of the world.
[1:08:46] And you see, those are the what we call
[1:08:49] the seed of God.
[1:08:53] The ones that were in him.
[1:08:55] They were always a part of God.
[1:08:59] But you see, they bypassed their
[1:09:01] theophony.
[1:09:05] They came into this body of sin
[1:09:10] and they've been groaning like all
[1:09:12] nature is groaning
[1:09:15] waiting for them to be redeemed.
[1:09:19] And we talked about the book in the book
[1:09:21] of Revelation chapter 5,
[1:09:24] how there was no one worthy to take
[1:09:28] in heaven and on earth. No man was
[1:09:30] worthy.
[1:09:32] And then as John was still weeping, the
[1:09:34] voice told him, "Weep not John
[1:09:37] for the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:09:40] the root of David has prevailed to take
[1:09:43] the book
[1:09:46] and to lose the seals thereby."
[1:09:48] And then we talked about the book and we
[1:09:51] found out that this book is the book of
[1:09:53] redemption.
[1:09:55] We found out it is the abstract title
[1:09:58] deed
[1:10:01] of everything that Adam had
[1:10:05] in the beginning. Everything he lost,
[1:10:09] everything he was, his true identity,
[1:10:14] his true title did to everything that is
[1:10:16] on earth
[1:10:19] was in that book. Here was the title
[1:10:22] deed and he lost it. But we saw that it
[1:10:26] could not go back to it could not go to
[1:10:28] the hands of Satan
[1:10:31] because his hands were filthy.
[1:10:34] Amen. Amen. And are you not so glad that
[1:10:38] your identity even when you were lost
[1:10:42] even when you were in sin? It cannot go
[1:10:45] to Satan.
[1:10:48] Amen. So it had to go back to the
[1:10:50] original owner God.
[1:10:53] Amen. And he had it in his right hand.
[1:10:57] And then who said, "Who is worthy to
[1:11:00] take the book and lose the seal?"
[1:11:03] No one was worthy. No man is worthy. And
[1:11:06] we found out that no none of us is
[1:11:08] worthy
[1:11:10] to do the work of redemption.
[1:11:13] And then we found out redeem
[1:11:16] is not to forgive.
[1:11:18] To redeem is to bring back what was
[1:11:22] lost.
[1:11:25] back to its original nature and state.
[1:11:32] To forgive is to see some some sinful
[1:11:37] thing or or person
[1:11:40] and removing sin from them.
[1:11:44] But so it's different. We were not
[1:11:47] sinners
[1:11:49] made children of God.
[1:11:53] We were sons of God.
[1:11:56] Listen, perfect, sinless
[1:11:59] in the image of God. But we came, we
[1:12:02] bypassed our theony coming into this
[1:12:03] world.
[1:12:06] And we came through sin.
[1:12:09] The Bible says in sin did my mother
[1:12:11] conceive me.
[1:12:13] But then we found that is not our true
[1:12:17] identity.
[1:12:21] This is not our true origin.
[1:12:24] This earth is not our true origin.
[1:12:27] We came from God. We go back to God.
[1:12:30] And when we say we came from God, it
[1:12:33] means we came from perfection.
[1:12:36] We go back to perfection.
[1:12:39] We came from that sinless image of God.
[1:12:43] And that's what we are going back to.
[1:12:46] So redemption
[1:12:47] bypasses Adam.
[1:12:51] It bypasses even Pentecost.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Are you following me now? Because
[1:12:56] Pentecost is the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:58] Spirit.
[1:13:00] And we found I there are some comments I
[1:13:03] wanted to make but let me pause them for
[1:13:04] now. But you see when we talk about
[1:13:07] redemption,
[1:13:08] it passes Pentecost.
[1:13:11] trustes Adam and goes way back into the
[1:13:15] mind of God.
[1:13:18] So now when you say I am redeemed,
[1:13:22] you are not just made a Pentecostal.
[1:13:26] More than that, you've not just been
[1:13:29] taken back to Genesis
[1:13:32] after the fall.
[1:13:34] More than that, you are taken way back
[1:13:39] in the mind of God.
[1:13:41] where your true origin is.
[1:13:47] So because you are seed
[1:13:50] and a seed of God cannot be lost.
[1:13:54] Praise the name of the Lord. So now
[1:13:56] we've been talking about many things,
[1:13:59] many, many things. And I trust that
[1:14:02] you've been, you know, going over them
[1:14:03] and, you know, reading the message and
[1:14:05] getting deeper.
[1:14:09] We also see tonight
[1:14:11] speaking of the right atmosphere
[1:14:14] of birthing the seed.
[1:14:18] Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are sick. Yes, you can be lost.
[1:14:23] But there is a problem. Even if you are
[1:14:26] a sin, if you are in a wrong atmosphere,
[1:14:34] nothing will happen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; So you remain the way you are.
[1:14:40] you won't be changed. Praise the name of
[1:14:43] the Lord. But now here in in vers 11,
[1:14:47] he says, "Now the parable is this
[1:14:50] because you are speaking of the ser
[1:14:53] who went out to sew and how he swed seed
[1:14:58] in different types of places.
[1:15:01] He spoke about sewing seeds. uh some the
[1:15:04] first ones they fell by the west
[1:15:08] and he talked about the ones that fell
[1:15:09] upon a rock.
[1:15:11] He talked about the others that fell
[1:15:13] upon the throne
[1:15:15] and and and the others that fell on good
[1:15:16] ground.
[1:15:18] So now he gives the interpretation
[1:15:20] and says now the parable is this the
[1:15:24] seed is the word of God.
[1:15:27] Are you following me now?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; The seed is the word of God.
[1:15:32] So, and you know I talked about you
[1:15:34] being seed
[1:15:37] and on Sunday I tried to show you
[1:15:39] the connection between you and the word.
[1:15:44] Amen.
[1:15:46] Amen. The word of God is a seed.
[1:15:49] You are a seed.
[1:15:52] The son of God is a seed.
[1:15:56] What spoke you into existence?
[1:15:59] The word of God.
[1:16:04] Where were you before the the foundation
[1:16:06] of the world?
[1:16:08] You were in God. What does that make
[1:16:10] you? It makes you a part of God,
[1:16:14] a part of his nature.
[1:16:17] And that means there is a part of God in
[1:16:21] me
[1:16:23] that no matter what the devil does,
[1:16:26] that part of of God in me can never be
[1:16:29] destroyed.
[1:16:31] That part of God in me is a table.
[1:16:35] That part of God in me can be buried
[1:16:39] but never forever.
[1:16:42] No matter where you place it,
[1:16:44] cannot die
[1:16:46] because it is eternal.
[1:16:49] That's why Jesus said, "Ye are gods."
[1:16:55] And and he says that it doesn't appear
[1:16:57] now what we shall be.
[1:17:01] But when he appears,
[1:17:03] we shall be like him
[1:17:06] because we are born of his bones, flesh
[1:17:08] of his flesh.
[1:17:11] But now here he's speaking of the seed
[1:17:15] being the word of God.
[1:17:17] And he begins by talking about those
[1:17:19] that were on that were the seed which
[1:17:23] was thrown on the west side.
[1:17:26] The devil comes and he takes away
[1:17:30] the word out of those hearts
[1:17:34] unless they should believe and be saved.
[1:17:38] Now
[1:17:41] the only the elect
[1:17:44] will not be deceived.
[1:17:48] The shark or the tears
[1:17:52] cannot be here with a sea.
[1:17:56] overcoming power
[1:18:00] the of the seed.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Follow me. Just just follow me closely.
[1:18:05] The power that overcomes the world.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; I told you and I said
[1:18:10] in you
[1:18:13] in the sea.
[1:18:15] Remember that eternal part
[1:18:18] which cannot be destroyed.
[1:18:21] That part,
[1:18:23] that part is what I call the seed.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And the power to overcome the world
[1:18:31] is in that part of it.
[1:18:35] Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] Not only in the written word,
[1:18:41] not only in the spoken word.
[1:18:44] And I told you I used to think
[1:18:47] that as long as the spoken word is
[1:18:49] preached,
[1:18:51] as long as the written word is read,
[1:18:55] people will believe. And I used to say
[1:18:58] the word can change anything and
[1:19:00] everything.
[1:19:04] Whereas an evangelist, you can you can
[1:19:06] preach that,
[1:19:09] but it's not entirely true.
[1:19:15] Follow me closely.
[1:19:17] When I say it can change. Yes.
[1:19:21] Because the word matures.
[1:19:24] The word matures
[1:19:27] but matures what you are.
[1:19:31] Are you following? Whatever you are, the
[1:19:35] word does not change it,
[1:19:38] but the word matures.
[1:19:42] So the overcoming power
[1:19:45] is not in the word itself
[1:19:48] but is in the seed of God
[1:19:54] in you that is being quickened by that
[1:19:57] word.
[1:20:02] The word quickens the seed.
[1:20:07] Only the seed can be quickened.
[1:20:10] Only the seed can be quickened and
[1:20:13] dramatized and it will come to life.
[1:20:16] If you bury a stone and you bury a
[1:20:18] seedinger
[1:20:22] and you put them in the right
[1:20:23] atmosphere,
[1:20:26] no matter what you do, this stone will
[1:20:29] never go.
[1:20:31] It will never be quickened.
[1:20:33] But that seed will be quickened
[1:20:37] because that seed has life.
[1:20:41] I'm going to begin this today with a
[1:20:43] little story
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; and I told um a little story that I told
[1:20:48] some brothers recently
[1:20:52] and um and you know I read it somewhere
[1:20:55] said that this boss was you know
[1:20:57] starting his company was um you know in
[1:21:00] in the evening years of his company
[1:21:03] of his life
[1:21:05] and he wanted to retire but he wanted to
[1:21:08] find a new CEO.
[1:21:12] He called he calls all the employees.
[1:21:15] He gives all of them seed
[1:21:18] and he told them this seed.
[1:21:20] I'm looking for a new CEO,
[1:21:23] but I'm going to give each of you one of
[1:21:25] these seed,
[1:21:27] the one that will take good care of the
[1:21:28] seed
[1:21:30] and ensure it grows and grows well
[1:21:35] be the one to replace it.
[1:21:38] So long story short, all of them took
[1:21:39] the seat
[1:21:41] and I think I don't know how many men
[1:21:42] there were, maybe seven of them or
[1:21:44] something like that, you know, all of
[1:21:47] them came back with beautiful uh uh
[1:21:50] plants,
[1:21:52] goodlooking plants in the pot
[1:21:55] and oh my, they were just so happy.
[1:22:00] Everybody was proud of their plant, how
[1:22:03] healthy it was looking.
[1:22:05] But then there came another one.
[1:22:08] who did not have anything.
[1:22:11] His port was empty.
[1:22:14] There was no plant
[1:22:16] but only a dead seed.
[1:22:19] So the the the CEO looked at all of them
[1:22:23] and told them congratulations
[1:22:27] and everybody was like
[1:22:29] and then he shook the hand of the one
[1:22:31] that did not have any plan.
[1:22:35] Congratulations
[1:22:38] you are the new CEO.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Nobody could understand that.
[1:22:43] But only the CEO
[1:22:46] knows what he had done.
[1:22:48] He had boiled those seeds.
[1:22:53] They had no life in them.
[1:22:59] They took the seeds.
[1:23:02] You know they had tried their best.
[1:23:06] to water them and bring them in the sun
[1:23:08] and make the atmosphere try them
[1:23:14] and they did not succeed.
[1:23:17] So each of them because they were not
[1:23:20] honest.
[1:23:22] They were not sincere.
[1:23:25] They went and brought other seeds
[1:23:29] and they planted them in the
[1:23:32] but who was sincere
[1:23:35] He thought he had failed.
[1:23:38] And he said, "No, even if I failed, let
[1:23:42] me go and tell my boss,
[1:23:44] I tried my best. I did what I could."
[1:23:49] And you know, he did not know that his
[1:23:52] boss had played a trick on them.
[1:23:56] The problem was not the atmosphere.
[1:24:00] The problem was the type of scene.
[1:24:06] You can have a wonderful atmosphere,
[1:24:09] but you can never create seed in that
[1:24:12] atmosphere.
[1:24:15] That atmosphere will only bring forth
[1:24:19] the seed which already has life in it.
[1:24:27] Praise the name of the Lord. So the seed
[1:24:29] needs a certain atmosphere.
[1:24:33] for it to be quickened,
[1:24:35] for it to come to maturity.
[1:24:38] Remember, it has to be quickened grow
[1:24:41] and come to maturity.
[1:24:43] And a normal seed will need good ground.
[1:24:47] We'll need water. We'll need a sun. And
[1:24:51] these are the things we're talking
[1:24:52] about.
[1:24:54] Brother Bam says, you know, well,
[1:24:57] someone may say, well, we are having our
[1:24:59] youth for Christ. Our
[1:25:03] church is having a meeting.
[1:25:06] We want so many members.
[1:25:08] Nothing against that. That's all right.
[1:25:12] But that is only the atmosphere.
[1:25:15] That might be an old hen's feathers.
[1:25:19] But if you get in the right atmosphere
[1:25:22] there,
[1:25:24] it will hatch eagle. If you are an eagle
[1:25:27] egg
[1:25:30] and if you were for ordained of God to
[1:25:32] see,
[1:25:36] you can't help from seeing it.
[1:25:39] You are coming forth in a resurrection.
[1:25:43] Amen. What does an atmosphere do? An
[1:25:48] atmosphere cannot bring forth a seed
[1:25:52] that was never meant to see it.
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:00] A preacher may preach, a preacher may
[1:26:03] dance, a preacher may shout, the
[1:26:06] preacher may preach until you say,
[1:26:09] but it is not the preacher.
[1:26:12] It's the nature of seed in you.
[1:26:15] That is why friends we we are preachers
[1:26:18] should never try to convince people
[1:26:22] to change
[1:26:24] force people to change.
[1:26:28] May God help me so I can bring it to you
[1:26:30] today.
[1:26:32] If I put up a tough face
[1:26:36] and I force you sisters
[1:26:39] to dress cut and I force you brothers to
[1:26:43] cut your hair in a certain way.
[1:26:48] Are you understanding me? And I force
[1:26:50] you dress certain way.
[1:26:54] You will do it because you're fearing
[1:26:55] me.
[1:26:57] Every time you think about doing what
[1:26:59] you want,
[1:27:01] you will remember my tough face
[1:27:04] and you remember when I said you will go
[1:27:05] to hell.
[1:27:08] So you will say ah I don't want and then
[1:27:11] you you will do what I I want you to do.
[1:27:15] You get a point and that is the problem
[1:27:18] with legalistic sermons.
[1:27:24] You get a point. So people will not show
[1:27:27] who they are.
[1:27:29] You will have a full church
[1:27:32] full of hypocrites
[1:27:35] full of people who are what they are
[1:27:37] not.
[1:27:42] So what do we need to do? There is only
[1:27:45] one solution
[1:27:47] to create the right atmosphere for the
[1:27:50] right seed to be born.
[1:27:57] and the right atmosphere.
[1:28:00] We find out it is in three forms.
[1:28:04] The first form is a good ground.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[1:28:10] talked about the nature of the ground
[1:28:14] and this is now you
[1:28:17] going to do it.
[1:28:19] How is your ground?
[1:28:21] How is your heart? How receptive are you
[1:28:25] whether you are seed of God or you are
[1:28:27] not.
[1:28:28] If you don't love the word if you don't
[1:28:31] open for the word. If you are not ready
[1:28:34] to be corrected.
[1:28:36] If you're not ready to learn.
[1:28:39] You can never change.
[1:28:42] And that's why the devil would try his
[1:28:44] best
[1:28:46] to make sure you don't come to church
[1:28:50] to make sure you don't get give time to
[1:28:52] God
[1:28:54] because you cannot know whether your
[1:28:56] heart is good or bad.
[1:29:00] You don't know whether your ground is
[1:29:01] good or bad.
[1:29:03] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:29:07] So
[1:29:09] the reason why we have church services
[1:29:12] is to create the right atmosphere for
[1:29:16] that is why we organize youth council.
[1:29:19] That's why we we listen to the message
[1:29:21] and we pray. We sing, we do all these
[1:29:23] things. But all these things will not
[1:29:27] and cannot change the Nancy.
[1:29:32] It can only make them realize who they
[1:29:34] are.
[1:29:36] When you come to church, you only
[1:29:39] realize who you are.
[1:29:41] As you are hearing the word, it places
[1:29:44] you in your place.
[1:29:46] I I love the word of God.
[1:29:50] Amen. That's why we should always go to
[1:29:52] a Bible church.
[1:29:56] Bible church,
[1:29:58] nothing less, nothing more.
[1:30:01] Because then how can you know who you
[1:30:03] are
[1:30:05] even if you were good ground?
[1:30:08] If the seed being sown there is wrong,
[1:30:13] how can you know who what what kind of
[1:30:15] ground you are?
[1:30:18] We need a Bible church.
[1:30:21] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:30:23] Now, but the Bam says something.
[1:30:29] You see no pumping up in broken systems.
[1:30:40] The sermon title is broken system.
[1:30:44] And so here it says, well, of course I'm
[1:30:47] beginning in the middle of the quote,
[1:30:48] but it says no pumping up. It's the
[1:30:50] power. The power is within itself.
[1:30:57] It needs no priming.
[1:31:01] It own life is in itself.
[1:31:06] The that's the way the seed of God is in
[1:31:09] a man's heart.
[1:31:13] The life of God is within the
[1:31:15] individual,
[1:31:19] not in the church. In you, it is in you.
[1:31:24] You are the one that has the jam of life
[1:31:27] in you.
[1:31:31] So I don't need to pump you up.
[1:31:34] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:44] I don't need to do that. I don't need to
[1:31:46] do that. I only need to give you the
[1:31:49] word.
[1:31:50] I may give you the word slowly.
[1:31:54] I may give you the word fast.
[1:31:59] I I may give you the word shouting.
[1:32:02] I may give you the word, you know, with
[1:32:04] a little voice.
[1:32:07] Depends on how I am made.
[1:32:10] But the bride loves the word.
[1:32:13] You don't need to pump them up.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; The bride is not supposed to be pumped.
[1:32:21] Just give them the word.
[1:32:23] And the the seed there is a jam of life
[1:32:25] in you.
[1:32:27] Whenever you hear something that is like
[1:32:29] the word
[1:32:33] of life in you
[1:32:35] will be somehow quickened.
[1:32:40] Amen. In the message original is the
[1:32:42] original seed.
[1:32:44] How can you tell them?
[1:32:47] Give them the word. Test.
[1:32:52] How can you know it?
[1:32:55] Speak the word. See what they say about
[1:32:58] it.
[1:33:00] You cannot differentiate who is who.
[1:33:04] That's why in a church when people come
[1:33:07] to church, you cannot use your physical
[1:33:10] eyes
[1:33:12] to tell who is who.
[1:33:14] You know when when king when prophet
[1:33:16] Samuel went in the house of Jesse
[1:33:20] you know he saw this good young man
[1:33:24] and you can say
[1:33:26] hallelujah he is this one behold the
[1:33:31] anointed of the Lord said God said watch
[1:33:38] all right I will look at her this one
[1:33:41] has a beautiful tongue
[1:33:46] This is a prophet
[1:33:48] and he was wrong each time.
[1:33:52] The only way you can know who the Lord
[1:33:54] has chosen.
[1:33:57] The only way you can know who who is the
[1:33:59] seed
[1:34:00] is give them the word.
[1:34:04] See what they say about you.
[1:34:07] If they don't believe the word,
[1:34:10] they have no seed jam in each.
[1:34:15] Amen. You see why we should tell our
[1:34:18] friends about
[1:34:21] don't fear to tell anybody about this or
[1:34:24] they will refuse. If they refuse, no
[1:34:26] problem. They are not seed
[1:34:30] but seed will hear the word and their
[1:34:33] seed in them will be quickened.
[1:34:37] They are of the evil one
[1:34:40] and and deceive you. As the first bride
[1:34:43] was deceived
[1:34:45] and the second bride was deceived,
[1:34:47] they are deceivers of the third bride
[1:34:52] by hibering the word
[1:34:56] or trying to. God never placed signs
[1:35:00] ahead of his work.
[1:35:05] Amen. God never placed signs ahead of
[1:35:08] his word.
[1:35:11] The signs were added for proof of the
[1:35:14] word.
[1:35:17] But the word is fast.
[1:35:20] To prove it, Elijah say to the woman,
[1:35:25] "Bake me a cake first.
[1:35:28] Then watch the miracle happen.
[1:35:31] Come to the word first
[1:35:34] and then watch the miracle happen.
[1:35:37] The seed word itself
[1:35:41] is what the Holy Spirit energizes.
[1:35:48] Amen. Hallelujah. Brother, sister, feed
[1:35:50] the on the word.
[1:35:52] Receive the word fast and wash when the
[1:35:55] Holy Spirit come.
[1:35:57] He will energize.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; He will energize
[1:36:01] that seed word in you.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; In a messenger trial.
[1:36:10] And the defense witness also wants to
[1:36:12] call your attention here.
[1:36:16] Amen. That the word of God is said by
[1:36:19] Jesus Christ to be a seed.
[1:36:23] And a seed can only grow when it falls
[1:36:26] into the fatile enough ground to quicken
[1:36:29] the seed.
[1:36:34] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. This
[1:36:38] message. You may say, I see it. I see
[1:36:41] it. Baptism in Jesus name is correct.
[1:36:44] Women are not supposed to wear trousers.
[1:36:47] Women are not supposed to be changed.
[1:36:51] Are you following me?
[1:36:55] Men are supposed to be men. Women are
[1:36:56] supposed to be men.
[1:36:59] And and and and you know, you begin to
[1:37:01] talk about all these mysteries
[1:37:04] of of the end time and the seventh seed
[1:37:06] and seven church ages and the seven
[1:37:08] seals and all these
[1:37:11] the operation of the gifts in the church
[1:37:13] and how the church must operate and
[1:37:16] tongues and interpretations and you know
[1:37:19] all these things you said.
[1:37:23] Someone
[1:37:24] if they are a seed,
[1:37:27] they are good ground.
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:31] If they themselves are a seed of God,
[1:37:34] they are a good ground
[1:37:37] for the word of God to be quickened.
[1:37:42] And if this seed falls into that kind of
[1:37:45] ground,
[1:37:47] it is fatile with faith.
[1:37:52] it has got to be quickened.
[1:37:56] Amen. But if there is nothing in there,
[1:38:00] I can say you're just wasting your time.
[1:38:04] Do you have a friend that you have ever
[1:38:05] spent time preaching the message to for
[1:38:07] a long time
[1:38:10] and nothing happened and you felt you
[1:38:13] had done your best?
[1:38:16] It's not about your best.
[1:38:18] God himself came and preached to Cain.
[1:38:22] God himself.
[1:38:24] He preached an evangelistic sermon.
[1:38:28] And it was not even a sermon to cut cut
[1:38:31] him.
[1:38:33] It was not a sermon to cut him.
[1:38:39] It was a sermon. Hope.
[1:38:42] You get the point. If you do well,
[1:38:46] won't you be accepted?
[1:38:48] But what happened to K?
[1:38:50] He never did well.
[1:38:53] He never believed the word
[1:38:55] because there was no jam of life there
[1:38:58] to be dramatized.
[1:39:03] There is nothing in there. So brother,
[1:39:05] sister, you have to believe that there
[1:39:07] are people on this earth who have
[1:39:09] nothing in there to believe with.
[1:39:16] No matter what you do, no matter what
[1:39:19] you say, you can never move them to
[1:39:21] believe the word.
[1:39:24] But there also some people
[1:39:27] who no matter what you do to them, no
[1:39:30] matter how much sin you bring into their
[1:39:32] life, no matter how far away they fall
[1:39:35] from the world,
[1:39:37] you can never take them to hell.
[1:39:40] Now those are the seed of God.
[1:39:44] They can never be lost.
[1:39:47] Those are the ones that we saw in the in
[1:39:50] the bridge.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The bleach of the blood of
[1:39:55] Jes.
[1:40:03] They can never be lost.
[1:40:05] Jesus said, "All you have given me
[1:40:08] are mine and I will lose none of them.
[1:40:13] Hallelujah.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; So I don't need to tell you what to do
[1:40:17] and what not to do.
[1:40:20] I need to keep preaching to you the
[1:40:21] word.
[1:40:23] I need to give you the word. If you have
[1:40:26] a seed of God in your soul,
[1:40:29] it doesn't matter what you are going
[1:40:31] through.
[1:40:33] Amen. That seed of God in your in your
[1:40:35] life, as long as it is receiving the
[1:40:38] word,
[1:40:39] it gets quickened.
[1:40:42] is getting it gets changed
[1:40:45] and you realize the things you were
[1:40:47] doing you no longer can do that. Why?
[1:40:49] Because you have been
[1:40:52] you have been made alive.
[1:40:55] Amen. If that same spirit amen that
[1:40:58] raised Christ from the dead in you, he
[1:41:02] shall do what we
[1:41:06] even body.
[1:41:09] That is the very last thing
[1:41:11] that is going to be quickened.
[1:41:14] But I can tell you friends right now our
[1:41:17] soul is quickened.
[1:41:20] Our spirit is quickened.
[1:41:22] We are waiting for our body. Hallelujah.
[1:41:25] Amen.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; One of this morning our body is going to
[1:41:29] be quick.
[1:41:30] We shall be translated
[1:41:33] into another body. Amen. Mortality.
[1:41:38] mortality
[1:41:41] shall be swallowed up of life and we
[1:41:46] shall have another body.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Never more to perish. Never more to to
[1:41:53] feel things that are not right.
[1:41:57] Never be touched anymore
[1:42:00] by bad feelings.
[1:42:02] Why? Because you will be changed.
[1:42:06] Just like if you wanted a blood
[1:42:08] transfusion,
[1:42:11] you went to a turnip,
[1:42:14] like a tube in yourself and in a turn.
[1:42:17] How are you going to get any blood?
[1:42:27] There is no blood there.
[1:42:30] No more can the word of God ever be
[1:42:32] quickened in an unbeliever's heart.
[1:42:39] or a skeptic.
[1:42:45] It is got to fall into the genuine faith
[1:42:48] that believes the heavens and earth will
[1:42:50] pass away.
[1:42:56] But that word shall never fail.
[1:42:59] Like Abraham that called things which
[1:43:01] was not as though they were, he hoped
[1:43:04] against hope in God.
[1:43:10] Amen. Friends, it is by faith we are
[1:43:12] going to overcome the world.
[1:43:16] That faith is not coming.
[1:43:18] That faith is not in heaven. That faith
[1:43:21] is right in us.
[1:43:24] Now we find that this defense witness
[1:43:26] wants to call this to attention.
[1:43:31] that the word is a seed
[1:43:33] that a s.
[1:43:36] It is written in the scripture that the
[1:43:38] word is a seed and a seed must fall.
[1:43:42] And the scripture says, some did fall on
[1:43:45] the stony ground
[1:43:47] and the birds of the air taken it away.
[1:43:50] Some fell just long enough to get enough
[1:43:52] roots to spring up
[1:43:57] and the thorns and thus choke it out.
[1:44:02] But some did go in good ground
[1:44:04] and it brought forth 100fold.
[1:44:08] He wants to call your attention to that.
[1:44:12] He wants to say that if this word
[1:44:16] in this Holy Ghost meeting
[1:44:19] where people were having hands laid on,
[1:44:24] it only applies to believers.
[1:44:29] Hallelujah. Are you a believer?
[1:44:33] It only applies to believers.
[1:44:38] There is no promise in here.
[1:44:42] But eternal separation from God to
[1:44:44] unbelievers.
[1:44:50] This promise is only to believers.
[1:44:56] Someone said to me not long ago
[1:44:59] said I don't care how much I don't
[1:45:02] believe.
[1:45:04] I said certainly not
[1:45:07] this is not for unbeliever.
[1:45:10] is for believer.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; They that believe.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; The things we preach presently, they are
[1:45:22] not for everybody. Don't fear when
[1:45:25] everybody doesn't believe.
[1:45:28] It is for believers.
[1:45:31] Hallelujah.
[1:45:33] Don't hate them when they don't believe.
[1:45:36] They just have nothing to believe.
[1:45:40] Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; God is covenant with Abraham and his
[1:45:48] seed in that.
[1:45:51] Listen to me. The right mental attitude
[1:45:54] towards any divine promise of God will
[1:45:57] bring it to pass.
[1:46:05] Are you a good ground?
[1:46:08] Amen. If you're a good ground, you will
[1:46:10] have a right mental attitude
[1:46:18] to the promise of God
[1:46:21] and that will bring it to to pass.
[1:46:25] I don't care what it is. I don't care
[1:46:27] what it is. If you can get a right
[1:46:30] mental attitude
[1:46:34] towards the promise
[1:46:37] for his promise,
[1:46:40] every word of God is his promise.
[1:46:44] Jesus said the word is a seed
[1:46:47] and every seed is a promise
[1:46:51] in there. And if you can if you can just
[1:46:55] take them seeds into your heart,
[1:47:00] no matter what it is for,
[1:47:05] God will honor it
[1:47:08] and it will bring forth
[1:47:11] just exactly what it promised.
[1:47:17] Oh my brother, sister, let us learn to
[1:47:22] take every word of God
[1:47:25] as a seed
[1:47:27] or promise
[1:47:30] in our hearts.
[1:47:32] He said it will never fail
[1:47:36] to bring forth
[1:47:38] what it promised it will bring.
[1:47:43] Amen. If he said you are going to be
[1:47:45] ahead,
[1:47:47] and not a tale. It is a promise in the
[1:47:50] word.
[1:47:51] It's not for unbeliever.
[1:47:54] For believers
[1:47:56] that will come to pass. If he said the
[1:47:59] eyes of the blind will come on,
[1:48:03] that's not for unbeliever.
[1:48:05] It is for believer. If he said the lamb
[1:48:08] shall walk,
[1:48:10] that promise is for believers.
[1:48:13] This son shall follow them.
[1:48:16] These are for believers.
[1:48:19] If he said our body shall be changed,
[1:48:22] our body shall be healed.
[1:48:25] These are promises
[1:48:27] for believers.
[1:48:29] If he said, "Whatsoever two shall agree
[1:48:34] about anything
[1:48:36] and they ask
[1:48:38] the father, it shall be granted."
[1:48:42] That is for believers.
[1:48:44] and whatever promise he gives.
[1:48:48] Amen. The right mental attitude.
[1:48:53] The right mental attitude
[1:48:56] towards every promise.
[1:48:59] So when you take the word, you receive
[1:49:01] it as a seed and you put it into your
[1:49:04] heart. You receive it as a seed. You put
[1:49:08] it into your heart and you say, "Amen, I
[1:49:10] believe it. Amen. I believe it. Amen. I
[1:49:14] believe it.
[1:49:15] It shall surely come to pass.
[1:49:19] Hallelujah.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; God will honor it.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; It will bring exactly what it promised.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:34] Amen. I have a few minutes. Let's let's
[1:49:36] talk a little bit about the water, the
[1:49:37] rain,
[1:49:42] which is another condition
[1:49:44] for the for the sea to grow.
[1:49:49] Water and rain is the same thing.
[1:49:52] You know, it talks about latter rain and
[1:49:55] former rain.
[1:49:56] [Music]
[1:49:57] If you read in the book of Joel chapter
[1:49:59] 2 vers 17,
[1:50:01] he says, "Be glad then ye children of
[1:50:02] Zion
[1:50:04] and rejoice ye in the Lord your God.
[1:50:08] He has given you the former rain
[1:50:10] moderate
[1:50:12] and he will cause to come down for you
[1:50:14] the rain,
[1:50:17] the former rain and the latter rain in
[1:50:18] the first month."
[1:50:21] and in the message anointed ones at the
[1:50:24] end time.
[1:50:27] A very good message for you to read.
[1:50:29] I want to quite a few things out of
[1:50:30] there.
[1:50:32] And after being in there a couple days,
[1:50:36] the Holy Spirit brought this scripture
[1:50:37] back to me. For the rain cometh off upon
[1:50:40] the earth to dress it with herbs.
[1:50:46] I believe this is somewhere in Hebrews.
[1:50:47] But ths and thistles live by that same
[1:50:50] rain.
[1:50:53] and whose end is to be burned
[1:50:58] and thorns
[1:51:00] living by the same lifegiving resource
[1:51:02] of God,
[1:51:06] the same that keep the wheat up.
[1:51:10] Then I understood that by Jesus said by
[1:51:15] their fruits
[1:51:17] they are known.
[1:51:19] You do not know them by the
[1:51:20] manifestation.
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:25] Even the Pentecostals receive the
[1:51:26] baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:51:30] That's for sure. Taught it. Said it and
[1:51:34] we believe it. But but you see we cannot
[1:51:37] know them because the baptism of the
[1:51:38] Holy Ghost baptizes you into the gifts
[1:51:44] into the man into gifts
[1:51:48] into the manifestation of the gifts.
[1:51:50] But by that we cannot know them.
[1:51:54] We are going to know them by the fruits.
[1:51:59] By the fruits they are known. Okay. Let
[1:52:02] me just read on so you can understand.
[1:52:04] Therefore, the rain dropping down upon
[1:52:06] the natural vegetation of the earth
[1:52:10] is a type of the spiritual rain which
[1:52:12] gives eternal life.
[1:52:15] Brother said, "You can be baptized, you
[1:52:18] know, with the Holy Spirit every day of
[1:52:19] your life and still go to hell."
[1:52:25] So you can see that brings the
[1:52:27] manifestation of the gifts and the the
[1:52:29] the the signs and the wonders.
[1:52:33] But that's just the anointing.
[1:52:35] It's just the anointing of it and and
[1:52:38] and both the seed and the tear we
[1:52:40] receive it.
[1:52:44] Okay? Follow me closely now. Dropping
[1:52:47] down upon the church for we call it the
[1:52:49] former rain and the latter rain.
[1:52:53] Let me go back a little bit now. For the
[1:52:55] rain dropping down upon the natural
[1:52:57] vegetation of the earth
[1:53:00] is a type of the spiritual rain
[1:53:05] which gives eternal life
[1:53:08] dropping down upon the church.
[1:53:10] For we call it the former rain
[1:53:14] and the latter rain. He'll explain it
[1:53:16] later for. It's a rain
[1:53:20] pouring out of God's spirit upon his
[1:53:22] church.
[1:53:25] Notice it's a very strange thing here.
[1:53:28] When them seeds went into the ground,
[1:53:33] however they got there,
[1:53:35] they were there were thorns to begin
[1:53:37] with,
[1:53:39] but there were the wheat that went into
[1:53:42] the ground also,
[1:53:44] and the herbs were herbs to begin with.
[1:53:52] And each hub was producing itself
[1:53:55] again showing that it was in the
[1:53:58] original beginning.
[1:54:00] And they were they will deceive the
[1:54:02] elected if it were possible
[1:54:06] because they getting the same reign,
[1:54:10] the same blessing, showing the same
[1:54:13] signs and the same wonders.
[1:54:16] They will deceive or shall deceive the
[1:54:18] elected if it were possible.
[1:54:20] Now a thorn cannot help being a thorn
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; and neither can whe help being a witch.
[1:54:32] It is what the creator
[1:54:35] of each one determined at the beginning
[1:54:41] but it is the same rain.
[1:54:44] Now follow me closely. When the rain
[1:54:46] falls,
[1:54:48] it falls on the good and the bad on the
[1:54:51] wheat and the tears.
[1:54:54] And the manifestation of the rain
[1:54:58] will happen to both of them.
[1:55:03] But what shows who they are?
[1:55:06] I for you here a vision where brother
[1:55:08] Bam s said that he saw um you know uh
[1:55:12] you know the the wheat and he also saw
[1:55:14] the other tears both of them you know
[1:55:16] dry
[1:55:21] and they were praying for oh God send
[1:55:23] the rain
[1:55:25] and then the rain came and they were all
[1:55:27] happy they were all rejoicing they were
[1:55:30] all speaking in tong they were all doing
[1:55:33] signs and miracles rejoicing under the
[1:55:36] same ring.
[1:55:38] [Music]
[1:55:39] So how can you know now which one is
[1:55:41] which?
[1:55:43] You cannot know by the manifestation.
[1:55:46] You have to wait until the harvest time
[1:55:51] cuz that's when they are ripe.
[1:55:54] That's when they have matured now.
[1:55:56] That's when you can tell what is where.
[1:55:59] He said leave them. Let them go
[1:56:02] together. But in the end, at the time of
[1:56:05] the end,
[1:56:06] amen, what will he do? You know, he he
[1:56:09] will cause a harvest
[1:56:12] and he will take the tears,
[1:56:16] bundle them for the burning. How is he
[1:56:20] bundling them? We have seen in this end
[1:56:22] time
[1:56:24] bundling them by the kinds of churches.
[1:56:29] Those are the denominations.
[1:56:31] They have the same sense one as
[1:56:33] manifestation.
[1:56:34] They look like the true church but they
[1:56:37] are not the true church. So they are
[1:56:39] being bound
[1:56:41] in bundles
[1:56:43] of their denominations
[1:56:45] for the burning but the bride. Amen.
[1:56:49] Will be done what the wheat will be cut
[1:56:54] and taken into the b.
[1:56:57] Amen. Which is the rapture. Now the
[1:57:00] translation of the saints.
[1:57:03] Now I want to close this portion here
[1:57:07] for you of the of the of the latter and
[1:57:09] the former reign
[1:57:13] so you can get it clearly and I want to
[1:57:15] quote it for you out of the the regime
[1:57:18] of the ages.
[1:57:22] This age started just after the turn of
[1:57:24] the 20th century
[1:57:28] and as it was to be the age in which the
[1:57:31] true church would return to being the
[1:57:32] bride she was at Pentecost.
[1:57:40] We know that there must of necessity be
[1:57:42] a return of the dynamic power.
[1:57:48] The believers sensed this in their
[1:57:50] spirits and began crying to God for a
[1:57:52] new outpouring such as was in the first
[1:57:54] century.
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:58:01] That seemed to be the answer came as
[1:58:03] many began to speak in tongues and
[1:58:05] manifest gifts of the spirit.
[1:58:12] It was then it was then that it was then
[1:58:17] uh it was then believed that this was
[1:58:19] indeed the long awaited restoration. And
[1:58:23] here he's speaking of Ausa.
[1:58:32] And now he says, "Oh, this the
[1:58:33] restoration we were waiting for
[1:58:39] the
[1:58:40] It was not
[1:58:42] for the latter rain
[1:58:44] for the latter because there's a former
[1:58:46] rain and a latter rain.
[1:58:49] But it says for the latter rain
[1:58:52] can come only after the former rain
[1:58:55] which is the spring or teaching rain.
[1:59:05] The latter rain
[1:59:08] is the outpouring of the spirit,
[1:59:12] the manifesting of God in a mighty way.
[1:59:16] But the former reign,
[1:59:18] the teaching reign.
[1:59:21] Are you following?
[1:59:23] Maybe we'll get into these things a
[1:59:24] little deeper. We'll talk about it on
[1:59:27] its own. But here now, he says, "When
[1:59:30] Asusa came,
[1:59:32] It was they said, "Oh, this is the
[1:59:33] latter rain.
[1:59:36] Oh, this is the the restoration that God
[1:59:39] promised.
[1:59:40] Power of God has come. Signs and
[1:59:42] wonders. Oh, it's the resurrection of
[1:59:44] Pentecost."
[1:59:46] And that began the Pentecostal movement.
[1:59:50] And he said, "This is it. This is it."
[1:59:53] But says, "No, it was not the promised
[1:59:56] restoration.
[1:59:59] Why? Because the promised restoration
[2:00:03] of the latter rain will only come after
[2:00:07] the former rain has come
[2:00:10] and the former rain is a teaching rain.
[2:00:15] Are you following me now? How could this
[2:00:17] be the real thing when the teaching rain
[2:00:19] had not come?
[2:00:23] The prophet messenger who was to be sent
[2:00:26] to teach the people
[2:00:31] and turned the hearts of the children
[2:00:33] back to the Pentecostal Father
[2:00:37] had not yet come.
[2:00:40] Thus, what was thought to be the
[2:00:42] restoration and the final quickening
[2:00:49] unto the quickening and the rapture
[2:00:52] had not yet come
[2:00:55] because they thought this is it.
[2:00:57] is the return of Pentecost.
[2:01:00] The only thing left is the rapture.
[2:01:03] But they did not understand
[2:01:06] that was not it
[2:01:08] because Malachi 4 prophet had not yet
[2:01:11] come.
[2:01:13] He was the one going to come
[2:01:16] with the former
[2:01:19] with a teaching reign
[2:01:21] which will restore the children.
[2:01:25] at the Pentecostal fire.
[2:01:29] So before the power of God will come
[2:01:32] before the quickening power
[2:01:36] comes finally
[2:01:38] translate us.
[2:01:41] Amen. Before that comes, we have to be
[2:01:44] restored fast.
[2:01:47] The altar had to be built again fast.
[2:01:50] There was a lot of mess.
[2:01:53] It needed to be cleaned up.
[2:01:55] by the ministry of Elijah the prophet.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; You see now he says in in it was a
[2:02:07] mixture of the unrighteous partaking of
[2:02:09] the spiritual blessing.
[2:02:15] is talking about that revival
[2:02:18] and the manifesting in the Holy Ghost
[2:02:21] as we have kept pointing out to you.
[2:02:24] I've talked about this for a few weeks
[2:02:26] now. How you see both of them manifest
[2:02:29] in the same power
[2:02:32] but some genuine and some false.
[2:02:34] You see, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:02:38] In it also was the devil power
[2:02:42] as men were under the control of devils.
[2:02:46] Yet no one seemed to realize it.
[2:02:50] Then to prove that it was not the real
[2:02:57] people even before a second generation
[2:02:59] had appeared.
[2:03:02] They organized
[2:03:04] and they wrote their unscriptural
[2:03:06] doctrines.
[2:03:10] and they built their own fences
[2:03:14] as every other group ahead of them did.
[2:03:19] And that's one proof. By the way, listen
[2:03:21] church, that's one proof of knowing the
[2:03:24] false vine.
[2:03:29] The first vine will always denominate.
[2:03:34] They will bring a ring around them.
[2:03:38] and circle everybody out
[2:03:41] and they will say we are the ones who
[2:03:42] are we are the only right ones everybody
[2:03:47] out of our denomination
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; is wrong and lost
[2:03:52] we are the only ones we are the right
[2:03:54] ones spirit of denomination
[2:03:59] I wonder if it is not encroaching on the
[2:04:01] message believers now
[2:04:04] but let me tell you the true believer
[2:04:08] will never denominate.
[2:04:11] Brother said if they draw a circle
[2:04:16] and they circle you out,
[2:04:18] draw a bigger circle
[2:04:21] and circle everybody in.
[2:04:25] That is why we are not a denomination.
[2:04:28] We are interdenomination.
[2:04:33] We are interdenomination.
[2:04:36] Everybody is welcome here. This is not a
[2:04:39] denomination.
[2:04:40] The Catholics are welcome. The Muslim
[2:04:43] have come. The Anglicans have come. The
[2:04:46] Pentecostals have come. Every
[2:04:47] denomination is here because we are not
[2:04:50] a denomination.
[2:04:53] We are preaching a message
[2:04:55] of restoration.
[2:04:57] Amen. So this I will tell you church
[2:05:01] the latter and the former reign
[2:05:03] together.
[2:05:07] Amen. He said the restoration of the
[2:05:09] world
[2:05:11] with it
[2:05:13] with it brother listen with it
[2:05:16] will come the restoration of power
[2:05:23] the former and the reign together
[2:05:27] I believe we have truth
[2:05:30] I'm satisfied on that I believe the
[2:05:32] wheat is absolutely the shark is pulling
[2:05:35] away from
[2:05:39] This is what brother is saying. I may
[2:05:42] give a little preload on that tomorrow
[2:05:43] night.
[2:05:45] How the shark is putting away from the
[2:05:47] wheat.
[2:05:50] But the wheat has to lay in the presence
[2:05:53] of the sun light to ripen.
[2:06:03] This is atmosphere friend. We have to be
[2:06:05] in we are the way but we have to be in
[2:06:08] the presence of the earth light.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the light of the world. I I he
[2:06:20] says and that's what we are here for
[2:06:22] friends
[2:06:24] to stay in the presence of the sun
[2:06:27] till our little group of people here
[2:06:31] till it becomes so ripe to Christ
[2:06:36] it become bread on his table
[2:06:40] that's what I wanted to do think how
[2:06:43] long this has been going on
[2:06:48] and this was 1965
[2:06:51] in the message things that are to be
[2:06:54] and he's asking think about how long
[2:06:56] this message has been going on
[2:07:00] but I can also ask you now think how
[2:07:03] long has the message been going on
[2:07:06] then he said 20 something years
[2:07:10] now I say more than 50 years
[2:07:14] and no organization
[2:07:17] [Music]
[2:07:19] Why? Here's the prophet asking of why it
[2:07:23] is the seed
[2:07:26] is the seed coming
[2:07:28] forming under the husk
[2:07:31] like this
[2:07:34] laying out. Now it's got to lay in the
[2:07:36] presence of the sun to ripen into the
[2:07:39] glorious grain like the one that went
[2:07:41] out into the fast.
[2:07:56] Yes, sir.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The real church that went down
[2:08:01] fast is coming right back through.
[2:08:08] Right through the stalk
[2:08:10] to come out. Another church. When the
[2:08:14] combine comes to pick it up,
[2:08:18] the life that went down in Luther,
[2:08:21] the life that went down in the
[2:08:22] Methodist, the life that went down in
[2:08:24] the Pentecost
[2:08:26] will come into the grain.
[2:08:29] It will go right into the grain
[2:08:33] and go out
[2:08:36] forming the perfect body of Jesus
[2:08:39] Christ.
[2:08:42] Just like the sun comes up
[2:08:47] in the morning, you can't look at no
[2:08:50] nature
[2:08:51] unless God testifies unless it testifies
[2:08:54] of God. Meaning all nature testifies of
[2:08:56] God.
[2:08:59] You don't even need a Bible to know
[2:09:00] there is a God.
[2:09:03] Just like the sun comes out in the
[2:09:05] morning.
[2:09:07] So will it be? No wonder the message.
[2:09:11] Shalom.
[2:09:15] The sun is up.
[2:09:18] It's a new day.
[2:09:20] What's happening?
[2:09:23] The seed which went down in all these
[2:09:28] church ages
[2:09:30] is now finally
[2:09:33] coming up.
[2:09:35] It's a new day.
[2:09:37] In this new day, it's going to ripen
[2:09:41] and be harvested.
[2:09:43] Which is that seed?
[2:09:45] You
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; and me.
[2:09:50] Amen.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; That's the atmosphere.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; The the word is the sunlight.
[2:10:04] That is going to mature. the musicians
[2:10:05] can come that he's going to mature the
[2:10:07] seed.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; May God help us that we will stay in
[2:10:13] that atmosphere
[2:10:16] and as you stand on your feet
[2:10:19] I'll read something here.
[2:10:21] Now church we are we are teaching now
[2:10:25] but remember when you leave here
[2:10:28] start moving out of the shack now
[2:10:32] you are going into the grain
[2:10:36] but lay in the presence of the son
[2:10:41] and he says don't add what I've said
[2:10:42] don't take away what I've said because I
[2:10:44] speak the truth as far as I know it
[2:10:50] as the father has given it to
[2:10:52] Don't add to it. Just say what I say.
[2:10:56] The thing of it is just tell the people
[2:10:59] to come seek the Lord Jesus.
[2:11:02] That's what we should tell our friends,
[2:11:05] our neighbors, everybody.
[2:11:07] And then you yourself as a believer now,
[2:11:11] brother Joseph, he says, "Lay right in
[2:11:14] his presence.
[2:11:17] Just make love to him.
[2:11:21] Oh, help me Jesus.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, son of God, I love you.
[2:11:30] Tender my heart, Lord.
[2:11:33] Take away all the filth
[2:11:35] and the love of the world and let me
[2:11:38] live holy
[2:11:40] in this present world.
[2:11:46] Shall we bow our heads for prayer?
[2:11:50] Lord Jesus,
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; it's my prayer too.
[2:11:56] [Music]
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Take away all the filth.
[2:12:02] Take away all the love of the world
[2:12:06] that I'll be totally dead to the world.
[2:12:10] That I'll be totally surrendered to you.
[2:12:15] that Lord we will have we will lay in
[2:12:17] the presence of the son.
[2:12:21] This is where we want to be.
[2:12:24] Help my brother my sister
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; to lay in that praise.
[2:12:31] Oh Jesus Jesus
[2:12:34] in a place where we can hear the word
[2:12:38] a place where we can read
[2:12:41] a place where we can be in a place of
[2:12:43] prayer.
[2:12:46] Lord that you build within us
[2:12:49] a kingdom that cannot be destroyed.

[2:12:57] Pray that Lord you will give grant us
[2:12:58] the desire
[2:13:01] of your heart.
