[9:15] together there cometh a woman of Samaria
[9:17] to draw water Jesus said unto her give
[9:19] me to drink for his disciples were gone
[9:22] away unto the city to buy meat then
[9:25] sayith the woman of Samaria unto him how
[9:28] is it that thou being a Jew asks drink
[9:33] of me which I am a woman of Samaria for
[9:37] the Jews have no dealings with the
[9:38] Samaritans
[10:04] Jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[10:08] know if thou knewest the gift of God and
[10:12] who it is that saith to thee give me to
[10:14] drink thou wouldest have asked of him
[10:18] and he would have given thee Living
[10:19] Water
[10:31] the woman said unto unto him sir thou
[10:34] Hast nothing to draw with and the well
[10:37] is deep from whence then hast thou that
[10:40] Living
[10:49] Water thou greater than our father Jacob
[10:52] which gave us the whale and drank
[10:55] thereof himself and his children and his
[10:58] cattle
[11:07] Jesus answered and said unto unto her
[11:09] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[11:11] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[11:14] the water that I shall give him shall
[11:16] never thirst but the water that I I
[11:19] shall give him shall be in him a well of
[11:22] water springing up into everlasting life
[11:45] the woman said unto him sir give me this
[11:49] water that I thirst not neither come
[11:53] hether
[11:58] [Music]
[12:05] Jesus said unto her go call thy husband
[12:10] and come hither the woman answered and
[12:12] said I have no husband Jesus said unto
[12:15] her thou Hast well said I have no
[12:28] husband for thou Hast had five husbands
[12:31] and he whom thou now Hast is not thy
[12:34] husband in that sayest thou truly the
[12:37] woman said unto him sir I perceive that
[12:39] thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped
[12:42] in this mountain and ye say that in
[12:44] Jerusalem is the place where men ow to
[12:47] worship
[13:07] Jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[13:11] hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[13:13] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[13:15] worship the father ye worship ye know
[13:18] not what we know what we worship for
[13:21] salvation is of the Jews
[13:42] but the cometh and now is when the true
[13:45] worshippers shall worship the father in
[13:48] spirit and in truth for the father
[13:50] seeketh suchar to worship Him
[14:07] and Jesus continued to say God is a
[14:09] spirit and they that worship Him must
[14:11] worship Him in spirit and in
[14:19] truth the woman said unto him I know
[14:23] that the Messiah cometh which is called
[14:25] Christ when he is come he will tell us
[14:28] all things Jesus said unto her I that
[14:32] speak unto thee am
[14:47] he and upon this came his disciples and
[14:50] marveled that he took he talked with the
[14:53] woman yet no man said what seekest thou
[14:56] or why took thou with her the woman then
[14:58] left her water pot and went her way into
[15:01] the City and said to the man come see a
[15:04] man which told me all things that I have
[15:07] ever did is not this the Christ then
[15:10] they went out of the city and came unto
[15:13] him
[15:42] amen you may be
[15:46] seated so this evening by God's grace I
[15:49] want to speak uh on the presence of
[15:56] God um it's not going to really be
[16:00] preaching as
[16:02] such I'm not dressed like a preacher
[16:05] tonight I'm just going to be uh you know
[16:08] sharing with you a few
[16:12] thoughts on the presence of
[16:15] God this thought came to me last night
[16:17] as we were in the family
[16:22] Altar and so uh I tried to stay away
[16:25] from it but you know I just felt that I
[16:28] should share something on this tonight
[16:30] with
[16:33] you
[16:35] amen uh so just a few words and then
[16:38] we'll go into
[16:41] prayer so when we talk about the
[16:43] presence of
[16:44] God um Everybody many people have
[16:48] different definitions
[16:50] for and by the way we are happy to have
[16:53] sister
[16:55] doas amen you're you're welcome it's
[16:59] been a long
[17:00] time looks like you had forgotten
[17:03] home yeah but we are happy that she's
[17:06] here
[17:07] tonight amen and to see all all of you
[17:10] who have made it in in this Friday night
[17:14] service I know this Friday night service
[17:16] is usually for those who in luga we
[17:22] say saying it is for those who can break
[17:25] through yeah it's by the grace of God
[17:29] and uh we have come because we need to
[17:30] be in his
[17:32] presence we have come because we are a
[17:35] needy
[17:37] people and we there is nothing like
[17:40] being in his
[17:43] presence you know if you are given an
[17:47] opportunity to be in a in the if uh to
[17:51] be in the presence of somebody
[17:54] great how will you
[17:56] feel to each of you you have your great
[18:00] people to some of you maybe it is the
[18:05] president to others it is your
[18:08] king where you come from to others it is
[18:12] your role model
[18:16] or someone that you've been
[18:19] following and then you feel that if that
[18:22] person
[18:24] came and shook your hand that would make
[18:28] your day
[18:29] it would make you a week maybe it would
[18:32] make you
[18:33] year because you have been in the
[18:36] presence of your
[18:39] idol you understand so now uh I believe
[18:44] there have been many Great Men on on the
[18:46] in the
[18:48] world many Rich many
[18:51] powerful uh many who have great
[18:54] names uh many who have made a very big
[18:58] things the world change the
[19:01] world and um you know when people at one
[19:05] time when people came in their
[19:08] presence they felt so
[19:12] special one of those men was
[19:15] Solomon and there was a woman all the
[19:18] way from
[19:20] Ethiopia called the queen of
[19:23] shba and the queen of shba heard of the
[19:27] wisdom of Solomon
[19:30] and the Bible says she traveled all the
[19:32] way from the land of
[19:35] shba I don't know how of course at that
[19:37] time they were traveling on
[19:40] Horseback there were no cars there was
[19:42] uh no uh you know airports and
[19:46] airplanes so she must have gone on
[19:48] Horseback or maybe even on uh uh you
[19:50] know those I believe they had horses yes
[19:55] chariots yeah and so she traveled from
[19:58] the of
[20:00] shba all the
[20:02] way to um to
[20:05] Israel and she was able to meet um
[20:10] Solomon and to to talk with him only to
[20:13] talk with
[20:14] him but you see when you go before a
[20:17] great
[20:18] man there's a day here I shared on um uh
[20:24] I shared on
[20:27] hor being you know when you give honor I
[20:30] said when you give
[20:32] honor you get
[20:34] access how many remember
[20:37] that those of you who missed it I'm sure
[20:40] it will do you
[20:42] good sowing
[20:44] honor and harvesting
[20:48] access and I told you that you know our
[20:50] generation most people do not honor
[20:53] others
[20:56] anymore you you find that we don't honor
[20:59] each
[21:00] other and um you find that older ones
[21:03] don't honor younger
[21:05] ones younger ones don't hon older
[21:08] ones but do you know that each of us has
[21:11] a different
[21:14] Grace that God has placed upon our
[21:17] lives and if you can be able to honor
[21:20] each
[21:21] other you realize that you you will you
[21:24] will have access to Greatness
[21:29] if you know if you want to understand
[21:30] what I'm talking
[21:31] about you look at all the great people
[21:34] today
[21:36] world you will see that they honor
[21:38] there's a certain person or certain
[21:40] people that they honor so
[21:45] much and that was able to give them
[21:48] access to a certain Grace or a certain
[21:50] anointing or or you know man upon their
[21:53] life
[21:59] so then there was this woman called the
[22:01] queen of
[22:03] shba so when she went before
[22:07] Solon she did not go
[22:10] empty-handed she was also a
[22:12] queen so she was a great woman
[22:15] in I believe she was a queen of most of
[22:18] the parts of
[22:20] Africa but when she traveled to
[22:24] Solomon she went with a lot of gold she
[22:27] went with a lot of silver she went with
[22:30] a lot of you know clothing and a lot of
[22:32] things the treasures of her
[22:35] country and and um you know and then she
[22:38] took it to King
[22:40] Solomon when King Solomon saw all these
[22:45] things his heart
[22:47] melted and he was happy and this woman
[22:50] got access to to
[22:53] him it is believed that the book of Song
[22:55] of Solomon
[22:59] was written you know speaking of Solomon
[23:01] and this queen of
[23:04] shba we know that the book of Song of
[23:07] Solomon is a
[23:09] type it is speaking of Christ and the
[23:13] bride I think one day I I'll take some
[23:16] time and preach out of it it's a very
[23:17] wonderful
[23:19] book so you can see that Solomon got
[23:22] favor before this uh uh I mean queen the
[23:25] Queen of Sheba God favor before Solomon
[23:30] when she reached his
[23:32] presence she didn't come
[23:34] empty-handed she came with gifts she
[23:37] came with praises she came with you know
[23:40] whatever you can think of had a lot of
[23:43] servants she had a lot of things I mean
[23:46] she didn't come alone so for her to get
[23:49] access to the
[23:51] king and to be able to test or to hear
[23:55] or be in the presence of his wisdom
[23:59] she had to come with all these things
[24:02] she had to Hon
[24:04] him you know as as you know uh uh
[24:09] people you know honor others even
[24:12] here imagine if you are some of you
[24:15] older
[24:17] sisters if a younger
[24:19] sister just looked at you and greeted
[24:22] you as if she was greeting a
[24:25] child and then just gives you your hand
[24:28] God bless your sister you can truly say
[24:30] that this
[24:32] sister does not have honor for
[24:34] me and your heart will be closed to
[24:39] her but if she comes to you with respect
[24:44] and reverence depending on the
[24:47] circumstances you know she may bow a
[24:50] b or or you know or or kneel or or you
[24:54] know um just bow a little bit
[24:58] and give you a
[24:59] hand you feel that you are
[25:02] honored even if your son wanted to marry
[25:05] that
[25:06] sister you will tell him you can go
[25:09] ahead she's a good sister but if she's
[25:12] not she's the kind that does not
[25:14] honor in your presence you can never
[25:18] support her because you you will say no
[25:20] no that's very wrong
[25:22] character and you find other sisters
[25:24] when they honor
[25:26] them or brothers they they they also
[25:29] feel like kings
[25:30] yes yeah yeah but I believe we should
[25:33] honor one
[25:34] another I saw one sister that was saying
[25:37] that if a younger sister comes to greet
[25:39] her honoring
[25:43] her you know trying to kneel
[25:45] down or you know some cultures they just
[25:48] bend a little bit like this so you will
[25:50] find that when this one does it like
[25:53] this the other will also do it and their
[25:56] knees will
[25:59] you know just comes and you know and
[26:02] their knees will
[26:03] me you know to show that you are
[26:06] honoring me but I'm also honoring you I
[26:09] believe we should always honor each
[26:11] other there is
[26:15] access in
[26:17] honor when you are in the presence of
[26:21] someone and you honor them there is
[26:26] access that you receive to certain
[26:29] things that you never had
[26:32] before today I'm not talking about
[26:35] hor I'm talking about the
[26:37] presence so this woman came and honored
[26:40] the
[26:41] king but there is no way you can talk
[26:43] about the presence without talking about
[26:46] the
[26:49] horor so when the king when the queen
[26:53] came before the
[26:54] king she honored the king and you know
[26:57] they had some very wonderful time
[27:00] together and then she left back to go to
[27:02] to her
[27:03] country and when she was leaving the
[27:06] king also honored her and gave her many
[27:10] many beautiful
[27:12] gifts praise the name of the Lord but in
[27:15] the presence of the
[27:16] king she went away a changed
[27:20] woman amen now today I want us to talk
[27:24] about another
[27:26] king one that is greater than
[27:29] Solomon our Lord Jesus Christ there is
[27:32] something about the presence of God I
[27:35] told you today I just want us to discuss
[27:36] a few
[27:38] things there is something about the
[27:40] presence of
[27:42] God that we as
[27:44] Believers and as a church we do not need
[27:48] to get used
[27:52] to the presence of
[27:55] God is where things happen
[28:00] happen is where healing takes
[28:04] place is where Deliverance
[28:08] happens you hear people call their
[28:10] churches deliverance
[28:13] churchur and you know for them they say
[28:15] they believe in
[28:18] Deliverance but you know FR message
[28:21] Believers we don't we don't do it like
[28:25] that why because every Serv service is a
[28:28] Deliverance
[28:30] service but our
[28:33] deliverance happens under under the word
[28:36] in the presence of
[28:40] God without that presence you cannot
[28:43] even talk about deliver not
[28:47] there it is in that
[28:51] presence you may have a burden and that
[28:54] burden will be lifted in that Pres
[28:58] you may you may have a problem even
[29:00] sometimes for
[29:02] years and when you enter that
[29:05] presence that burden will just leave
[29:08] you maybe it may be a big problem but
[29:11] you see the qu the problem that we have
[29:13] many Believers don't enter that
[29:17] presence you know when God comes
[29:20] down after or during the preaching of
[29:23] the word you find that there are some
[29:25] other people who are very dry
[29:30] they don't even know what is taking
[29:31] place they're looking around they're not
[29:35] understanding what is
[29:38] happening look at this one is
[29:40] falling look at this one is
[29:42] crying
[29:44] this I can never cry like this someone
[29:47] once told
[29:49] me you know Pastor the word was so hot
[29:52] the other
[29:53] day I almost
[29:56] shouted another said the word was so
[29:58] good I almost cried I just had to get
[30:03] out so I don't cry before the people I I
[30:06] looked I said poor this
[30:08] one you don't understand there is
[30:12] something about the presence of
[30:15] God actually we in the message many
[30:19] people in this
[30:20] message we do not appreciate the
[30:23] presence of God enough
[30:29] that's a bad thing because you see we
[30:31] have educated ourselves with all the
[30:35] doctrines with all the good
[30:37] teachings we know how we should dress we
[30:40] know how we should talk we know what we
[30:42] should do and what we should not do but
[30:45] when you talk about the
[30:48] presence it's not
[30:51] there be it in our family
[30:54] altars be it in the churches we are very
[30:59] you find someone even younger
[31:01] people you know we are singing but they
[31:04] are very
[31:05] dry you find them looking around it used
[31:09] to be that new people who came in the
[31:11] church new
[31:13] Believers that they are the ones when
[31:16] you know people are singing or
[31:17] worshiping they don't know what is
[31:21] happening so they know they did not all
[31:25] they knew is something out out there
[31:29] they do not know how to behave
[31:31] themselves in the
[31:33] presence they they did not know how to
[31:35] yield to the
[31:37] presence so when he comes they don't
[31:40] know how to behave so they begin looking
[31:44] around whenever you see someone like
[31:46] that is either new or he does not know
[31:50] anything about the Holy
[31:53] Spirit and then that kind of person will
[31:56] come in and go out the way
[32:02] I feel I will not even exhaust this
[32:04] today there is much I want to talk about
[32:07] the
[32:09] presence did you know brother Enoch a
[32:13] preacher can preach for 1 hour or two
[32:15] hours and you get
[32:17] nothing but in that
[32:20] presence everything you
[32:23] needed all the questions you
[32:25] have would be finished
[32:28] in that
[32:29] presence there is something about the
[32:32] presence of
[32:34] God you know when you are in before the
[32:38] presence of a great
[32:40] man you come with
[32:43] expectation you come believing something
[32:45] is going to
[32:47] happen I want you to think about it if
[32:50] the president called you to the state
[32:53] house do you think you're just going to
[32:55] go and walk away
[32:59] if Sister PE the president sent you an
[33:02] invitation to begin with you won't
[33:04] believe is it is this
[33:06] m and then after you have believed it is
[33:09] yours then you are going to begin the
[33:11] excitement
[33:13] first then you going to show it to your
[33:17] friends some of you may not even show it
[33:19] to
[33:20] anyone because you don't know someone
[33:22] may do something which will hinder you
[33:24] from
[33:26] going you really want to go and you are
[33:29] under
[33:31] expectation you believe something good
[33:34] you don't even know what but you believe
[33:35] something good is going to come
[33:38] out something good is going to happen
[33:41] because you're going before the presence
[33:42] of the
[33:44] president but this is only a man who is
[33:48] going to die just like the rest of us
[33:51] and you find people bragging and
[33:52] boasting because they close to the
[33:54] president or because they close to the
[33:55] king or because they close to so and so
[34:02] and but for us we have a
[34:05] king amen who is the king over all the
[34:09] kings of the
[34:11] world and we have his
[34:18] audience his word tells us amen he can
[34:21] hear us anytime we want to call on
[34:25] him he says ask ask and he shall receive
[34:30] amen knock and it shall be open for for
[34:34] you so in other words he says I'm always
[34:37] available whenever you want me just come
[34:40] and access me
[34:42] freely and in the presence of
[34:46] God things always
[34:49] happen and by the way whenever you are
[34:51] maybe in
[34:53] church and you feel like shouting
[34:58] you
[34:59] shout it's not just a
[35:02] feeling it is honoring the presence of
[35:07] God when you feel like Clapping Your
[35:10] Hands you do it when you feel like
[35:13] running
[35:14] around you feel like crying or kneeling
[35:18] down don't even care about your
[35:21] neighbor why because whatever you feel
[35:24] like doing it is revealed to you
[35:28] and when you do it it is your way of
[35:30] honoring
[35:33] him it's your way of honoring him you
[35:35] know when you see a great man
[35:37] coming you automatically feel like
[35:39] kneeling
[35:40] down oh you're
[35:42] welcome you know depending on your
[35:45] culture you see of course there some
[35:48] cultures I've told you here before that
[35:49] don't kneel
[35:51] down and there other cultures that
[35:54] KN and other cultures Bend
[35:58] but I want to tell you every culture has
[36:00] a way they
[36:03] honor every culture has a way
[36:07] of others just bend a little
[36:11] bit others kneel down others lie
[36:15] down you know and others I mean there
[36:18] are many ways of
[36:19] Hing and so even
[36:22] worship is a
[36:24] honor when you are worshiping
[36:26] God you recognize his
[36:30] presence
[36:32] immediately do whatever he tells you to
[36:34] do do whatever I mean you should be soft
[36:37] in your heart don't Harden your heart in
[36:41] the presence of the
[36:43] king you know if it's to shout or cry
[36:48] out I mean go ahead and do
[36:50] it you know if you have a gift or
[36:53] something or speaking in tongues or
[36:56] giving a prophecy
[36:58] these kind of things as long as it is
[37:00] given in
[37:01] order go ahead and do it it used to be
[37:05] that in the message churches we now
[37:06] feared even those
[37:09] things you know talk about Tong T are
[37:12] for
[37:14] Pentecostal Tong are from Pentecostal
[37:16] they say but I want to show you
[37:18] something
[37:19] here in The Book of
[37:22] Mark in The Book of Mark chapter 16s
[37:27] 15 and he said unto them go ye into all
[37:30] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[37:32] Creature he that believeth and is
[37:34] baptized shall be saved but he that
[37:36] believeth not shall be
[37:44] damed and these
[37:46] what signs are you following me and
[37:50] these signs shall follow them that
[37:54] believe in my name they shall cast out
[37:56] devils
[37:59] amen you believe that Amen in my name
[38:02] they shall speak with
[38:04] what it's right there they shall speak
[38:08] with everybody repeat that they shall
[38:10] speak with new tongues do we believe
[38:13] that we believe in speaking in
[38:16] tongues actually this is a sign of those
[38:20] that
[38:23] believe not not the
[38:25] nonbelievers he said shall follow the
[38:30] Believers the unbelievers seek after
[38:32] those
[38:34] signs but the Believers don't seek
[38:37] them the Believers are followed by these
[38:41] signs so in other words if we are
[38:44] believers those signs will be in
[38:47] abundance in our
[38:50] mid it is not a
[38:52] shock it is not a surprise as a matter
[38:56] of fact it is a surprise shock if we
[38:58] don't have those signs in our
[39:02] Med if we don't if we can't cast out
[39:05] demons and if we can't speak in new
[39:08] tongues and if we can't interpret these
[39:11] tongues and if we can't see the gifts of
[39:13] healing and the gift you know all these
[39:16] things if you can't see it in a
[39:17] minut then there's a problem with our
[39:21] faith there is a problem with our
[39:25] belief it means our God is
[39:27] dead and we are not in his
[39:30] presence but to all those who are in his
[39:34] presence this things happen
[39:37] friends hallelujah amen it can be one
[39:41] song that will Propel you into that
[39:45] presence you know I told you this
[39:47] thought came to me last
[39:49] night I was shocked friends I was
[39:52] shocked I mean I was very tired and we
[39:55] had um you know a very late family
[39:58] alar I think about 10 or you know 10:
[40:02] p.m. yeah so we usually have family
[40:05] alter 8:30 we should have it around that
[40:07] time but this week will been a bit you
[40:10] know later on and so uh yesterday we had
[40:14] it around 10
[40:16] p.m. and so you know the some children
[40:18] were even already you know sleeping and
[40:22] and so we prayed and shared the
[40:24] scripture and S and you know and so they
[40:27] went to bed and and so
[40:31] before the big ones of us were like
[40:34] about I don't remember how many maybe
[40:36] seven or five I don't
[40:38] know I have a big family I don't
[40:40] remember how
[40:42] many and so we were just there
[40:45] worshiping and we sang song after song
[40:48] and after song and
[40:50] planned but as we began honoring
[40:54] him as we began honoring God
[40:58] after one song and we had one playing
[41:01] the piano and another one the guitar and
[41:04] we just worshiping and honoring him and
[41:06] honoring him and honoring him and there
[41:09] something happened to
[41:11] me that actually I've seen the presence
[41:14] of God happen many
[41:17] times many times you can feel that his
[41:20] presence is about to
[41:21] come but that one happened without me
[41:24] expecting
[41:26] it I honored him and sang from my
[41:30] heart and sang from my
[41:33] heart and he was with all of my
[41:37] heart all of the
[41:39] sudden something just came over
[41:42] me called it like a
[41:46] spell and I couldn't stop
[41:49] it started you know um like the prophet
[41:53] would
[41:56] saying and you know just crying out and
[42:01] uncontrollably and these brothers who
[42:02] were playing and singing and they just
[42:06] continued on and it looked like
[42:08] everybody was glued to
[42:10] that and by let me ask you a question
[42:14] what do you call
[42:15] that you call it
[42:18] excitement I call it the presence of
[42:21] God you know when you honor him whenever
[42:25] those moments happen
[42:27] and you honor him yield
[42:31] yourself yield
[42:33] yourself just do it with all your heart
[42:36] and you may even be having a problem
[42:38] that moment when you honor
[42:41] him in that
[42:43] presence the prophet says in that SP of
[42:46] a
[42:48] moment I would just find that quote and
[42:50] read it for you
[42:52] also I told you I'm just discussing this
[42:54] with you tonight
[42:58] praise the name of the
[42:59] Lord hallelujah hallelujah the the
[43:03] prophet would you know talk about the
[43:08] SP of a
[43:12] moment and each of us need these
[43:18] friends I just pray that the Lord will
[43:20] would give it to
[43:22] us whenever we are in his
[43:25] presence praise the name of the
[43:30] Lord I just pray I get the court that
[43:33] I'm looking for
[43:49] quickly praise the
[43:52] Lord I think it's a wonderful quote that
[43:55] I have to read for you all
[44:00] I'm just searching out for the quot I
[44:01] did not plan to read it for you
[44:05] [Music]
[44:20] today brother bam would talk about um
[44:23] when you know just like a moment that
[44:26] happens
[44:30] yeah I think I got it in the message
[44:32] works is Faith
[44:39] expressed listen to what it says he says
[44:42] I want to tell you something
[44:44] now work on that
[44:54] pulsation thank you for interpreting it
[44:56] that way how many have ever felt
[44:59] that you've ever felt that in the
[45:02] presence of God he says work on
[45:08] it that Spar of A
[45:13] Moment Like Joshua did like Mary
[45:16] Magdalene all just that
[45:21] moment when something is revealed to
[45:24] you grab it grab
[45:28] meaning it may just
[45:30] leave many times when brother bam is in
[45:33] a prayer
[45:35] line someone would you know he would say
[45:38] I see someone in the
[45:40] congregation or and you know I see the
[45:43] the pill of fire over somebody El and he
[45:47] would say please don't miss
[45:48] it please don't miss it oh he's about to
[45:51] miss oh she's about to miss you would
[45:55] see the move of the
[45:58] spirit the
[46:00] pulling or the rejection of it and then
[46:03] he would say oh she's missed
[46:07] it and then someone would get
[46:10] it how does that happen it is the whole
[46:14] thing is in this
[46:16] quot just that
[46:18] moment when something is revealed to
[46:21] you grab it now when he says when he can
[46:25] come to you as a pulation
[46:28] he says your healing is
[46:30] now God Is providing for you
[46:33] your jump up and shout jump up and raise
[46:36] your
[46:37] hand and then you be like ah
[46:41] no how will I
[46:43] be and then that that that thing leaves
[46:48] you and you see it keeps happening to
[46:53] Believers it keeps happening to
[46:55] Believers and that is very
[46:57] sad and you come to the whole service
[47:00] and nothing
[47:01] happen because when something was
[47:03] happening you rejected it you push it
[47:08] away he says that when that just moment
[47:11] when something is revealed to you grab
[47:15] it you know what is grabbing
[47:19] it you know not just catching it but
[47:23] grabbing
[47:24] it hold it to it
[47:28] that Spar of
[47:32] moment work on that
[47:38] pulsation sometimes it's not even the
[47:40] whole service for
[47:42] you is just maybe the preacher may speak
[47:45] something that will resonate with you or
[47:46] something that and then you should just
[47:48] catch
[47:52] it praise the name of the Lord there is
[47:55] something about the presence of God good
[47:58] friends I've seen people there was a
[48:03] girl um that came in one of our
[48:07] services and she had a spirit on
[48:11] her she kept on falling and falling and
[48:15] falling and um you know they took her to
[48:18] a lot of
[48:20] people they took her to which doctors
[48:23] even it never worked they took her to
[48:26] [Music]
[48:28] pastors they would pray for her the
[48:30] thing goes and then comes back again and
[48:33] so she she kept on would just be there
[48:36] and then Falls passes out and then she
[48:39] begins shaking and Shing you know people
[48:42] you've seen people who are like
[48:43] [Music]
[48:44] that and so she just came in the service
[48:49] a
[48:50] nonbeliever and when the word was going
[48:54] on as the word was going before even the
[48:58] word finished as the word was going
[49:02] on something she had
[49:04] something and she received it she
[49:08] grabbed it she
[49:11] shouted and received it and before you
[49:14] knew it
[49:16] again she had just passed out and she
[49:19] fail the same way she always fall but
[49:22] that falling was
[49:25] different she receiv her Deliverance
[49:27] right in that
[49:31] service she never from that moment until
[49:33] today she never have never had that she
[49:35] ever fail
[49:37] again that's SP of a
[49:40] moment that's why you shouldn't be
[49:42] shocked when you see people falling in a
[49:45] service sometimes it is someone
[49:47] receiving the Holy
[49:49] Ghost sometimes is someone being
[49:51] delivered of
[49:54] something sometimes it is just someone
[49:56] you know walking into their
[49:59] Victory because we believe in being
[50:01] slain in the Holy
[50:05] Spirit you know it is possible do you
[50:08] believe that well we believe it because
[50:10] we have seen it and we continue to
[50:11] believe
[50:13] it you see the presence of God changes
[50:18] everything about what you planned or
[50:20] what you
[50:22] thought amen when God comes down
[50:26] everything is
[50:28] rearranged oh my you remember I don't
[50:31] want to preach but oh my this is just
[50:32] burning me right now you remember when
[50:35] Moses came down the children of Israel
[50:38] said Moses you are the only one that
[50:41] speaks to him but we also want to see
[50:45] him and we want to speak to
[50:48] him God told Moses is it what they said
[50:52] it is all right I will come to them but
[50:56] before I come come to them I want you to
[50:58] prepare them tell them to be
[51:01] clean clean up wash
[51:04] everything those of you who are shabby
[51:06] and dirty and
[51:09] unclean the Holy Spirit cannot come in
[51:11] your
[51:13] room the presence of God forget about
[51:17] it I'm just preaching to you
[51:19] tonight especially you younger men if
[51:23] you don't want to shower I don't want to
[51:25] wash your clothes don't want to clean
[51:27] your room or your house and when someone
[51:29] enters
[51:32] there what's happening the presence of
[51:34] God can't come
[51:36] there God told them tell them to clean
[51:40] up wash everything clean everything and
[51:45] then on the last day here was what is
[51:48] going to happen he said I will come
[51:51] around the end of that
[51:54] mountain and
[51:57] and you know um you know everybody will
[52:00] just come
[52:03] near and you know what happened those
[52:06] people could not comprehend that
[52:12] presence they could not comprehend they
[52:14] could
[52:15] not they told Moses please
[52:18] Moses tell him to go our away please
[52:23] tell him to go away we are going to die
[52:27] for our life tell him to go
[52:29] away you talk to him and give us the
[52:34] report but we don't want to
[52:37] die praise the name of the Lord that's
[52:39] why there are Realms of the presence of
[52:44] God we may never walk
[52:48] into people like brother have walked
[52:50] into
[52:52] them are you hearing me there are
[52:54] certain RS of presence that we may not
[52:58] be able to walk
[53:00] into but even what what we he allows us
[53:06] access it is so
[53:08] holy it is so wonderful that in that
[53:13] presence nothing can
[53:16] fail hallelujah
[53:18] amen I
[53:20] remember
[53:23] vividly one day I was in Western
[53:28] Kenya some years ago and I had one of
[53:31] the brothers who was assisting me who is
[53:33] now the pastor there in
[53:37] Ethiopia and um he was going to have his
[53:41] wedding and you know he didn't have
[53:43] enough money for his wedding
[53:45] and he one of the first Believers and it
[53:49] was a bden a burden on my
[53:52] shoulders and I did not know what how to
[53:54] encourage him what to tell him
[53:58] and his family was poor they didn't have
[54:01] money so I was keeping the matter in
[54:06] prayer and one day but uh very early in
[54:10] the morning around 3 34
[54:14] a.m. I had just slept off as usual we
[54:18] were in meetings there so this was the
[54:21] middle of the night before we go to
[54:23] another meeting in the
[54:25] morning I will never forget that
[54:28] experience you know I had prayed up the
[54:30] whole evening we were in charge and we
[54:32] had a wonderful time in his
[54:35] presence and at that moment you know I I
[54:39] kind of woke up and and then fell into a
[54:44] trans and I saw
[54:47] myself come before the
[54:50] presence of
[54:52] someone now friends I I I know it was
[54:55] Christ
[54:59] oh brother would you know um I don't
[55:02] know what to say but I
[55:04] know it was Jesus
[55:06] Christ because this is what I knew when
[55:10] I was in his
[55:12] presence I looked at him I couldn't see
[55:15] his
[55:16] face but I was seeing it I can't explain
[55:20] it I couldn't see his
[55:24] face but I could see him
[55:28] I I I cannot say that he looked like
[55:30] this or
[55:32] that but I saw him I couldn't I can't
[55:37] explain I'm
[55:40] sorry but the Lord knows I'm saying
[55:44] the and I was as I was standing
[55:48] there before
[55:50] him and I started to tell him what this
[55:54] brother was going through
[55:58] he he he listened to me and heard
[56:01] everything that I was saying and then he
[56:04] took me friend that that that is the
[56:07] most sweet feeling you ever
[56:12] have you know as I talk about it I
[56:14] remember how it felt I started crying
[56:18] uncontrollably I wasn't actually crying
[56:20] but I was just shedding
[56:22] tears and that
[56:24] presence and and then it took me
[56:27] and and and you know put me around his
[56:31] shoulder and um then he started
[56:34] talking and it was as if he was speaking
[56:37] to that
[56:39] brother I remember all the words he
[56:41] spoke to
[56:42] him and he said he said the money that
[56:46] he has is
[56:49] enough I have provided to him
[56:53] enough and say and and then he say said
[56:57] and then then what Chang said he said he
[57:01] called that brother's
[57:03] name and then he began speaking to him
[57:06] words he said you're my
[57:09] son and I love you and the resources
[57:13] I've given to you are just enough for
[57:16] you and the other words he
[57:20] spoke and I was in a
[57:23] trance and when I woke up when I woke up
[57:26] out of
[57:28] this I realized I was just crying
[57:32] physically I couldn't believe it I was
[57:35] crying and there was a great I don't
[57:38] know whether to call it
[57:40] fear or reverence
[57:42] or that
[57:44] atmosphere and I was just crying and
[57:47] crying and I picked up my phone and I
[57:51] started recording those words that I
[57:54] heard and I recorded them
[57:56] and and you know as I cried and later I
[57:58] sent it to the
[57:59] brother and you know what friends that
[58:02] brother did not need any extra
[58:07] coin what he had is what God
[58:11] multiplied and he had a powerful
[58:15] wedding but friends I tell you he told
[58:18] me other things there but what I I said
[58:22] this to say this the presence of God is
[58:25] real
[58:28] our God is
[58:30] real and when he says anything in his
[58:34] word he is always ready to accomplish
[58:38] it and brother bam said if you want
[58:42] angels to appear to
[58:44] you speak about the
[58:47] Lord you know in your daily walk you
[58:50] know in your family in your in your life
[58:54] if you begin to talk about the Lord
[58:56] there is no way angels will not appear
[58:58] to
[58:59] you and we have had many testimonies of
[59:02] people who have had visitations of
[59:06] Angels the other day I was speaking to a
[59:08] sister who told me you know she had an
[59:10] Angelic visitation in her
[59:14] room one of them even took a
[59:17] picture let me tell you friends God is
[59:20] real we just living in this
[59:24] Dimension where we do not have access to
[59:26] the other
[59:27] dimension but that other
[59:30] dimension we can be able to access
[59:34] it if we hit the right
[59:37] door at the right time in the right
[59:42] moment you can literally walk through
[59:44] that
[59:45] door and see what
[59:48] Supernatural eyes can
[59:50] [Applause]
[59:52] see God can literally you know transform
[59:55] your eyes
[59:56] and you can be able to see what others
[59:58] can
[59:59] see amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:03] amen it happened it has been happening
[1:00:06] to very
[1:00:07] many you know uh you know not just to
[1:00:10] brag about it but even my
[1:00:12] wife when we were in Ethiopia she she
[1:00:16] met that
[1:00:18] angel you know as she was in Prayer by
[1:00:21] the way whenever you hear an angel
[1:00:23] appeared an angel appeared someone was
[1:00:26] either in
[1:00:28] prayer in fasting or in singing but they
[1:00:32] must have been seeking after that
[1:00:40] presence the pillar of fire never left
[1:00:43] this
[1:00:44] message amen the pillar of fire is still
[1:00:49] available God is still with
[1:00:53] us this message is not only you know the
[1:00:57] words and teachings and
[1:01:01] doctrines the doctrines are important
[1:01:03] because they bless
[1:01:06] us but much more than that we are
[1:01:10] seeking after his
[1:01:13] presence let me tell you when you walk
[1:01:15] into that
[1:01:16] presence even dark addictions can
[1:01:21] break it completed something which was
[1:01:24] so impossible to you
[1:01:26] but when you walk into that presence it
[1:01:29] can completely become
[1:01:32] nothing you've had people who say I was
[1:01:34] a
[1:01:35] drunken I was immoral I was doing that I
[1:01:40] did not know how to overcome it but one
[1:01:43] day when I was praying something
[1:01:47] happened to me and then I begin
[1:01:49] explaining what happened what was that
[1:01:52] it was the presence of
[1:01:54] God when his shows up and you receive it
[1:01:59] that SP of a
[1:02:01] moment then he begins to
[1:02:05] activate certain elements in
[1:02:08] you then he begins to do
[1:02:11] things what man cannot do then he begins
[1:02:15] to create your
[1:02:16] job can you imagine creating a job God
[1:02:19] can do
[1:02:20] it it is done in the
[1:02:23] presence you know things which are
[1:02:26] possible when you are in that presence
[1:02:29] things begin to happen he let me tell
[1:02:32] you when you go in that
[1:02:34] presence and you are in prayer you are
[1:02:37] no longer the one
[1:02:39] praying you begin praying words he
[1:02:42] places on your
[1:02:44] mouth and that kind of prayer it is so
[1:02:47] sweet you even feel like you don't want
[1:02:49] to stop you feel like you are just you
[1:02:53] know in another world
[1:02:55] and many times Amen in your private
[1:02:58] prayers you can even begin busting in
[1:03:01] other times and begin praying in
[1:03:05] tongues you know Apostle Paul actually
[1:03:08] said that if you can't interpret your
[1:03:11] tongues pray alone in
[1:03:14] secret so Apostle Paul believed in
[1:03:16] praying in
[1:03:18] times Hallelujah do we believe it
[1:03:22] exactly we believe it he said in church
[1:03:26] it should be
[1:03:27] interpreted because we need to be
[1:03:30] edified we need to know what you are
[1:03:33] saying hallelujah but if you're in your
[1:03:36] private
[1:03:37] prayers in your prayer
[1:03:40] closet you can even pray in
[1:03:43] tones you can even sing in tongues I
[1:03:46] remember there is a day I sang in Tong
[1:03:47] for almost 30 minutes 1
[1:03:50] hour but I was jumping the whole time as
[1:03:53] a young child
[1:03:55] and I was having many
[1:03:57] Revelations I was having many
[1:04:01] upliftings don't think I'm going crazy
[1:04:04] friends this is the presence of
[1:04:07] God Amen when you walk into that
[1:04:09] presence you are into another real you
[1:04:13] are no longer into the realm of debate
[1:04:15] or trying to
[1:04:18] understand you are now in the
[1:04:21] real even of the
[1:04:23] supernatural where all things are
[1:04:27] possible where before you prayed for
[1:04:29] something that never
[1:04:31] works but when you are in that presence
[1:04:34] you pray for things and they actually
[1:04:37] happen What is the difference the
[1:04:40] difference is in the presence amen he is
[1:04:44] there to make it
[1:04:47] work that's why whenever we go and
[1:04:49] prayer
[1:04:50] Brethren amen try to enter that
[1:04:54] presence that's why we see
[1:04:56] songs that's why we pray you know to do
[1:04:59] what to enter into that
[1:05:03] presence this woman at the well she
[1:05:06] walked into that
[1:05:08] presence she came from wherever she was
[1:05:10] coming from she was living in sin amen
[1:05:14] but when she came in that
[1:05:17] presence amen when she met Jesus she
[1:05:21] actually even never
[1:05:23] knew that the man Jesus was actually God
[1:05:28] himself and as she walked into his
[1:05:31] presence you know something that moves
[1:05:34] me
[1:05:35] here Jesus sent away all the
[1:05:38] disciples and he told them go and buy
[1:05:42] meat imagine telling 12 men to go and
[1:05:44] buy
[1:05:46] meat because he was setting himself
[1:05:50] up to go and give someone his presence
[1:05:57] he will leave
[1:05:58] 99 just to give you his
[1:06:01] presence that's why sometimes you will
[1:06:03] see someone will receive a
[1:06:07] spark whereas everybody is not knowing
[1:06:09] what is
[1:06:10] happening it is your day of your
[1:06:13] visitation someone may someone next to
[1:06:15] you may feel
[1:06:17] nothing but when you you are swimming in
[1:06:19] the waters of
[1:06:22] Revival amen because God has come your
[1:06:25] way
[1:06:27] praise the name of the Lord and this
[1:06:29] woman as she met with Jesus Jesus began
[1:06:33] to talk to
[1:06:34] her and you know Jesus told her things
[1:06:38] about her
[1:06:40] life she said give me to
[1:06:43] drink she said I'm a I'm a
[1:06:47] Samaritan we have no connection with
[1:06:50] the she said if you
[1:06:52] knew who was asking you to give me today

[1:07:01] me to give you because the water I will
[1:07:05] give

[1:07:09] thirst

[1:07:16] say when you come in that
[1:07:19] presence you drink and you cannot thirst
[1:07:24] again amen amen if you have thirst for
[1:07:28] alcohol and you drink the alcohol he
[1:07:31] gives

[1:08:37] those filthy stuff

[1:09:11] spectator whenever the presence of God
[1:09:14] comes I never want to be a
[1:09:17] spectator I just immediately close my
[1:09:19] eyes and I said Lord give me all s to
[1:09:24] drink ref kill
[1:09:26] me the woman said unto him sir you don't
[1:09:30] have anything to draw
[1:09:32] with and the well is deep how will you
[1:09:35] give me this living
[1:09:37] water are you greater than Jacob our
[1:09:41] father Jesus had answered and said
[1:09:44] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:09:47] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[1:09:50] the water that I shall give him shall
[1:09:51] never
[1:09:53] Thirst by the water that I give him
[1:09:56] shall be in him a well of water
[1:09:58] springing up into everlasting
[1:10:04] life amen the woman said unto him sir
[1:10:09] give me this water that I thirst
[1:10:12] not give it to me when you walk into
[1:10:15] that
[1:10:16] presence you are not like I don't care I

[1:10:19] mind you said give it to me give it to
[1:10:22] me I want to
[1:10:24] drink give it to to me and the woman
[1:10:27] asked for it neither he said I don't
[1:10:30] want to come here to draw I want to
[1:10:32] drink
[1:10:34] this and Jesus changed the
[1:10:36] story he said go call me your
[1:10:39] husband by the this is what happens in
[1:10:41] the presence of
[1:10:43] God he reveals
[1:10:47] everything those kind of SES when you
[1:10:49] come to
[1:10:50] church and the preacher is literally
[1:10:52] talking about your life
[1:10:55] how did you know that how did
[1:10:58] you friends whenever you are in such
[1:11:01] Services it is the same
[1:11:04] Jesus just know you are in the
[1:11:07] presence and behave like this woman
[1:11:10] behave what did she do she didn't walk
[1:11:14] away sometimes you feel you see the
[1:11:16] presence of God coming
[1:11:18] down and there someone walking out the
[1:11:22] church almost you want to cist alone
[1:11:27] and you walk
[1:11:29] out how can you do
[1:11:31] that in that
[1:11:33] presence this woman could not walk
[1:11:37] away said go fetch me your
[1:11:40] husband and then Jesus said the woman
[1:11:43] said I have no
[1:11:44] husband Jesus said yes sure you said the
[1:11:47] truth because you've had
[1:11:50] five and even the one you're living in
[1:11:53] with right now the is also not
[1:11:56] yours so in other words you're a
[1:11:59] prostitute you've been going from one
[1:12:02] man to
[1:12:04] another thinking about this woman she
[1:12:07] must have been looking for
[1:12:09] something she did not find with the
[1:12:11] first
[1:12:12] man she didn't find with the second man
[1:12:15] she didn't find with the third with the
[1:12:17] fourth thinking about people who do
[1:12:22] immorality did you know the imoral
[1:12:26] Spirits cannot be
[1:12:30] satisfied
[1:12:33] cannot you cannot live in
[1:12:36] immorality with one man or one woman it
[1:12:40] is impossible why because it is a
[1:12:45] spirit and you you are seeking you have
[1:12:48] a
[1:12:49] thirst you are seeking to satisfy the
[1:12:53] thir but you see this Spirit lies to you
[1:12:57] tells you this one will help
[1:12:59] you and if it doesn't this will help you
[1:13:04] this help you so you will never find Mr
[1:13:07] best you'll never find Mr best or Miss
[1:13:11] best you you find that you are always
[1:13:16] unsatisfied you find you're always
[1:13:19] unhappy something is
[1:13:21] lacking but friends you just walk into
[1:13:24] that presence one
[1:13:28] I've seen it happen
[1:13:30] before to a
[1:13:36] prostitute I've seen it happen
[1:13:39] before I've given this story many
[1:13:42] times how we met
[1:13:44] her in on one of the streets in
[1:13:47] Ethiopia and we were just preaching just
[1:13:50] going going back home
[1:13:52] and and um then you know she introduced
[1:13:56] herself to us just called us called on
[1:13:58] us and myself and the brother that I was
[1:14:01] with
[1:14:02] and brother Paul and so she started
[1:14:05] introducing herself to us long story
[1:14:07] short turns out she's a
[1:14:10] prostitute but then we invited
[1:14:13] her we gave her an
[1:14:15] invitation reason because we couldn't
[1:14:18] communicate well with
[1:14:19] her because of language barrier so we
[1:14:23] gave an invitation so that she can come
[1:14:24] at time when we have another
[1:14:29] interpreter and this woman came and we
[1:14:31] sat down with her together with brother
[1:14:34] and this sister who was
[1:14:36] interpreting and um when she walked into
[1:14:38] the room she was shocked to find Two
[1:14:44] Men and and one woman and she was dead
[1:14:48] fourth I don't know whatever went
[1:14:50] through her
[1:14:51] mind but as she so she was like what
[1:14:55] come come come
[1:14:56] in and then soon enough she noticed
[1:14:59] there were open Bibles on the
[1:15:02] table she noticed she was under
[1:15:06] attack
[1:15:08] friends the God of this message is a
[1:15:10] living
[1:15:11] God hallelujah he's a living God that's
[1:15:16] what I witnessed that
[1:15:17] day and this woman sitting there with
[1:15:21] all this weird makeup on
[1:15:23] her she thought she had come to
[1:15:25] work she did not know she had come to be
[1:15:28] worked
[1:15:30] on and and and then right there as we
[1:15:33] quickly went into the
[1:15:34] scriptures and then we started preaching
[1:15:37] to her and we introduced ourselves and
[1:15:39] started preaching to her the
[1:15:41] word speaking about Jesus and how Jesus
[1:15:44] loves her and how Jesus can save her and
[1:15:48] and what does she say about these things
[1:15:50] she said I have been a prostitute for 10
[1:15:53] years
[1:15:56] this is the only job I know how to
[1:15:58] do I I don't think I don't I don't want
[1:16:01] to deceive
[1:16:02] Jesus I don't want to do that I I want I
[1:16:06] I don't want to do that friends I have
[1:16:08] no
[1:16:09] power within me to leave this job I told
[1:16:14] her look it's like as if she had spared
[1:16:18] of
[1:16:20] something picked the scripture and they
[1:16:21] started reading to her not by power
[1:16:25] nor by might but by my spirit sayth the
[1:16:29] Lord and as we read that scripture to
[1:16:32] her something lighted up within her she
[1:16:36] began realizing there is another power
[1:16:39] we talking about there is something
[1:16:41] which can literally overtake her she
[1:16:45] realized at that moment she was in
[1:16:47] another
[1:16:50] presence let me tell you what happened
[1:16:53] from that moment began
[1:16:56] crying what made her cry it wasn't
[1:16:59] anything that we say it was the word
[1:17:03] designing a
[1:17:04] heart just like the woman at the
[1:17:07] world and that woman right there she
[1:17:11] started crying and crying and crying and
[1:17:13] then immediately she said I've decided
[1:17:17] to give my life to
[1:17:19] Jesus we baptized her that same
[1:17:23] day and she became a believer in the
[1:17:27] church Hallelujah one of our church
[1:17:31] first church
[1:17:32] members happen to become a converted
[1:17:36] prostitute let me tell you Jesus is
[1:17:39] still in the same business
[1:17:41] today he can change even the
[1:17:46] worst all it takes is that
[1:17:50] presence I am showing you it is not a
[1:17:53] man that does it

[1:17:57] decided from today I am going to do like

[1:18:16] everything in you and changes your mind
[1:18:20] and changes your desire and changes even
[1:18:23] the way you were thinking

[1:18:29] spirit amen this beyond what you've been
[1:18:32] hearing it is beyond what is
[1:18:35] written is the power that
[1:18:37] changes and that happens in the
[1:18:40] presence and this woman as she was
[1:18:43] standing there she
