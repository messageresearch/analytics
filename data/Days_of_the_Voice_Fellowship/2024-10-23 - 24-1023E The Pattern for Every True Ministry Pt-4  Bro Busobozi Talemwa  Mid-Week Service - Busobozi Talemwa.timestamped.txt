[36:50] am thank you musicians I think that's
[36:52] all the singing we will do for
[36:56] now uh if you can take your Bibles with
[36:58] me while you're still
[37:02] standing we usually have a short time on
[37:04] Wednesday
[37:07] evening so we go straight away to the
[37:11] word
[37:13] and I I see I think this is a friend of
[37:16] joah you're
[37:17] welcome my eyes could to see you nice to
[37:20] see
[37:21] you amen so uh this
[37:25] evening I would uh have also been asked
[37:28] to minister to the Saints at evening
[37:30] light bright
[37:34] Tabernacle so we
[37:36] will be speaking to them as well in the
[37:41] service and listening they're going to
[37:44] be listening to this on
[37:48] Zoom so we send our
[37:51] greetings and also greet each of you in
[37:53] the name of our Lord Jesus
[37:56] Christ um going to continue on the
[37:58] subject we've been talking on this is
[38:00] the third service or the fourth service
[38:04] rather the pattern for every true
[38:10] Ministry and we've been looking at
[38:13] different things so tonight we'll see
[38:15] how the Lord will lead
[38:19] us um we will read that verse again
[38:22] Romans 11:29
[38:31] whenever I'm speaking to evening light I
[38:32] just do one
[38:37] hour so just give me your undivided
[38:42] attention for the gifts and calling of
[38:45] God are without
[38:49] repentance Romans 1129
[39:03] can you interpret it according to the
[39:05] KJV for the gifts and calling of God are
[39:09] without
[39:14] repentance I do not know
[39:17] Whata means um how how does that
[39:20] understand how is it rendered because
[39:22] here I understand that God gives it and
[39:26] you do not need to repent for him to
[39:28] give it to you that's how I understand
[39:29] it how do you understand it
[39:37] in
[39:40] okay that is also true but um you know
[39:44] they do not add this other meaning
[39:45] because you see if yes if God has given
[39:49] you a
[39:50] gift he doesn't
[39:54] regret even Satan all the gifts he
[39:59] when he was still in
[40:00] heaven when he fell they were never
[40:02] taken from
[40:04] him so God doesn't
[40:07] regret but that's not the exact
[40:11] meaning it's saying when God gives I
[40:14] mean the basis he's talking about the
[40:16] the basis of God gifting
[40:21] you and calling you it is without
[40:25] repentance
[40:28] without
[40:29] repentance yes that's exactly what I'm
[40:32] trying to talk
[40:33] about we can also look at vers
[40:40] 24 um or did I say vers 24 I would like
[40:43] us to look at Matthew
[40:48] 24 vers
[40:55] 24 um we can begin from the
[40:59] 23 then if any man shall say unto you
[41:02] law here is Christ or there believe it
[41:04] not for there shall arise false christs
[41:07] and false prophets and shall show great
[41:10] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[41:13] were possible they shall deceive the
[41:16] very
[41:21] elect 23 24 23 2423
[41:50] I'd like us also to look at the next
[41:52] verse behold I have told you before
[41:54] whereof if Thou shalt say
[41:59] wherefor if they shall say unto you
[42:02] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[42:04] behold he is in the secret Chambers
[42:07] believe it
[42:18] not praise the name of the
[42:21] Lord hallelujah maybe um you may be
[42:24] seated
[42:32] now regarding first of all of course um
[42:35] this is just a continuation so I hope I
[42:37] will not say things that are new to some
[42:38] of you who are just hearing for the
[42:40] first time
[42:46] tonight now speaking of
[42:49] gifts you are born with
[42:53] gifts you do not have to first repent of
[42:56] your sins and be saved for God to give
[42:59] you
[43:02] gifts and because of that many people
[43:04] have been
[43:07] confused they thought that great gifted
[43:10] people are
[43:14] saved it means that they are
[43:16] automatically going to
[43:19] heaven but we
[43:21] found that actually there will be many
[43:24] who will even be uh gifted
[43:29] but they will not make it into the
[43:30] kingdom of
[43:32] God on Sunday we spoke about that
[43:36] extensively how many will cast out
[43:40] Devils how they will prophesy in the
[43:42] name of
[43:43] Jesus how they will do many wonderful
[43:46] works in the name of
[43:49] Jesus but when they get there Jesus will
[43:52] say unto them go away from me doers of
[43:56] iniquity I never knew
[44:00] you so then we find it is not because of
[44:03] these
[44:05] Works uh through our
[44:09] gifts that we will receive
[44:12] salvation and therefore we do not test a
[44:15] true
[44:18] Ministry only because the man is doing
[44:21] many miracles and wonders signs and
[44:24] wonders if it was so
[44:27] we would actually have you know also
[44:30] join some of those churches where demons
[44:32] are cast
[44:34] out and they called them Deliverance
[44:39] Ministries you know all where some of
[44:42] those churches where we only hear
[44:46] prophecies and um you know all some of
[44:48] those churches where wonderful Miracles
[44:50] are
[44:52] wrote but we understand all these things
[44:55] are part of the word
[44:58] miracles signs wonders and casting out
[45:01] of
[45:03] demons it's part of the word is part of
[45:07] the as we shall see later on tonight is
[45:09] part of the true
[45:11] Ministry but you see it is not the only
[45:15] basis upon which you say this is a true
[45:21] Ministry and so on Sunday I la to show
[45:23] you that extensively
[45:27] and um to those who were here and those
[45:29] who
[45:30] listened and I also I've added this
[45:33] scripture in Matthew
[45:35] 24 that says
[45:38] um that false Christ shall
[45:41] come now remember he never said false
[45:46] jesuses but he said for there shall
[45:48] arise false
[45:51] christs so now this the word Christ here
[45:54] means the anointed ones
[45:58] so he says false anointed ones will
[46:02] come why are they
[46:05] false yet they are
[46:08] anointed so in other words they are
[46:10] anointed with the right
[46:14] anointing but they are false teachers of
[46:17] that
[46:20] anointing how many understand that say
[46:23] Amen so you see they mislead people
[46:27] they misguide them simply because they
[46:30] are
[46:32] anointed you see and I we also read many
[46:36] other scriptures like the one that shows
[46:37] that Satan has made himself the angel of
[46:43] Light and his ministers also the
[46:47] Ministers of
[46:49] righteousness so there are many people
[46:51] who will
[46:53] preach but when God never sent them
[46:57] the devil is using
[47:00] them it is it is so ironical that you
[47:03] see they would take the Bible and preach
[47:06] it but when they are not Servants of
[47:10] God but Servants of
[47:12] Satan but we found out from Matthew
[47:16] 7 that the Bible says ye shall know them
[47:19] by their
[47:21] fruits and he said every tree that
[47:24] bringeth not good fruit is is is is H
[47:27] down and cast Into the
[47:31] Fire where by their fuit you shall know
[47:35] them not everyone that saith unto me
[47:38] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[47:40] of
[47:42] heaven but he now listen to this but he
[47:45] that doeth the will of of of My Father
[47:48] which is in
[47:51] heaven so now in other words it is not
[47:55] only all those that profess confess
[47:59] Christ that that confess they are
[48:03] believers that say they believe what the
[48:06] Bible
[48:08] says it's not about all
[48:11] those it's only the select
[48:15] few that do the will of
[48:19] God and what is the will of
[48:23] God the will of God is the full councel
[48:26] of his
[48:30] he said Heaven and Earth shall pass
[48:32] away but my my word shall never pass
[48:36] away so you see they they will they will
[48:39] they will put their faith upon the basis
[48:41] of the
[48:44] word not the basis of their man of
[48:47] God not on the basis of their Church
[48:51] manuals not on the basis of what their
[48:53] denomination believes
[48:57] they will be Spirit L they will believe
[48:59] the word
[49:03] 100% And so he also says many will say
[49:07] to me in that
[49:09] day Lord we have prophesied in your
[49:12] name have we not in your name we we've
[49:16] cast out
[49:17] devils in your name we have done many
[49:19] wonderful
[49:20] works and I'll profess unto
[49:23] them I never knew you depart from me ye
[49:28] that work
[49:30] iniquity so now this scripture in
[49:33] Matthew
[49:34] 7 can be aligned properly aligned with
[49:38] the one of Matthew
[49:41] 24 because the one of Matthew
[49:44] 24 is saying there shall arise false
[49:47] Christ of course in the end
[49:51] time and false
[49:53] prophets and they will show Great Signs
[49:58] and
[49:59] wonders now now remember the Bible did
[50:03] not tell us to fear the one true
[50:08] Prophet the Bible told us to fear the
[50:11] many false
[50:14] prophets but again in the same
[50:17] Bible he gives a prophecy in
[50:20] Mal over over a true Prophet who will
[50:23] come in the last days
[50:27] and he says this Prophet when he
[50:29] comes he will take the hearts of the
[50:32] children and restore it back to the
[50:35] father and we have received that prophet
[50:37] in this end
[50:39] time but he says we should fear the many
[50:41] false
[50:44] prophets and of course there's much I
[50:46] can talk about
[50:49] them but I want I want us to stick with
[50:51] the subject for tonight the pattern for
[50:53] every true Ministry
[50:59] second Peter 1:10 says wherefor there
[51:01] rather Brethren give diligence to make
[51:03] your calling an election
[51:11] sure you by God but you have to make it
[51:15] sure in Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy
[51:19] 45 make full proof of your
[51:23] ministry so how can you know
[51:27] that God has truly called
[51:29] you so now I'm not tonight I'm not
[51:32] speaking really so much about the false
[51:34] prophets and that kind
[51:35] of I'm speaking about the true
[51:39] Ministry and each of us is called by
[51:43] God each of us is gifted in a a certain
[51:47] way so then how can you
[51:50] know that such and such a thing is what
[51:52] I'm supposed to do to serve the
[51:55] Lord how can you know you are supposed
[51:57] to be a
[51:59] singer you are supposed to be a preacher
[52:02] how can you know you are in the perfect
[52:03] will of
[52:05] God praise the name of the Lord when
[52:08] someone receives the Holy Spirit they
[52:11] should be
[52:12] blessed in their perfect place to serve
[52:15] the
[52:16] Lord the Holy Spirit activates
[52:20] you and you become an active member of
[52:23] the body
[52:26] one way of knowing you don't have the
[52:28] Holy
[52:29] Spirit is being dant in the
[52:34] body you know if you want to know that
[52:37] one part of your body is not
[52:40] working it will be
[52:42] dant it's like you know if like I'm I'm
[52:45] a full body from head to
[52:49] toy but you see if my hand for
[52:53] instance does not move
[52:56] remains in one place and the other body
[53:00] moves but that hand remains in one
[53:04] place it means it is a dead part of the
[53:07] body it means it is
[53:11] nonfunctional and there it is
[53:13] useless so now you find many people in
[53:16] the
[53:17] body not this body I'm talking about the
[53:20] body of Jesus
[53:22] Christ whereby they are nonfunctional
[53:26] they are
[53:27] static they in the same place they never
[53:30] do anything
[53:32] to I believe when you receive the Holy
[53:36] Spirit he's going to activate
[53:39] you he's going to make you realize what
[53:41] you should
[53:43] do for the sake of the Gospel is going
[53:47] to make you
[53:49] understand what part are you in the
[53:52] body the Bible says there are many
[53:55] parts about vessels and he says some are
[53:59] vessels of
[54:00] horor and he says some are vessels of
[54:03] Dishonor but all
[54:05] vessels in the house and in this case we
[54:09] speaking about the house of the
[54:11] Lord what type of vessel are
[54:15] you whereby you realize you in the
[54:17] church one year two years three years
[54:18] four
[54:19] years there is nothing you can and you
[54:22] call yourself a
[54:24] Christian you can't play mus
[54:27] you can't sing a
[54:28] special you can't
[54:30] preach you can't testify to your
[54:33] neighbor you can't interpret you are
[54:36] seeing that sometimes we need
[54:37] interpreters you just
[54:39] SE I'm a
[54:41] Believer a Believer who does nothing is
[54:43] useless to the
[54:46] body you can't give your money you can't
[54:49] pray for the preachers I mean there many
[54:52] things to do the Holy Spirit Will
[54:54] activate you
[54:57] you can't become
[54:59] Idol you canot remain
[55:02] Idol he will BL it on your heart and he
[55:05] will confirm
[55:07] it and you will become an active
[55:10] member of the body of Jesus Christ now
[55:14] we will not all do the same
[55:17] things you know in in in Romans 124 he
[55:21] says for as we have many members in one
[55:24] body
[55:26] and all members have not the same
[55:29] office so we being many are one body in
[55:34] Christ and everyone members of One of
[55:39] another have you got it if you've got it
[55:41] say Amen so we are one body in
[55:45] Christ but we are not one
[55:48] members we are many
[55:51] members the body of Jesus Christ is a
[55:53] many membered body
[55:57] and it's all over the
[56:00] world having then gifts having then
[56:04] gifts no we are members and then he says
[56:08] having then gifts deferring according to
[56:10] the
[56:14] grace that is given to
[56:16] us where the prophecy let us prophesy
[56:21] according to the proportion of
[56:23] Faith Ministry us on our
[56:27] ministry and I told you there many many
[56:29] types of
[56:31] Minister it's not only preaching there's
[56:35] many other types of
[56:36] ministry even the brother or sister who
[56:39] cleans the
[56:41] church ministering to the
[56:43] body you know we cannot do without
[56:46] them imagine if you came to a church and
[56:49] you found it very dirty and smelly and
[56:51] Dusty
[56:54] and you cannot concentrate
[56:57] you want to hear the word but you
[56:59] can't but you see because there's a you
[57:01] don't even know who clean
[57:03] the quite frankly many times they come
[57:06] to church without even knowing who
[57:07] cleaned the
[57:09] church and they never
[57:12] paid but whoever does it is a part of
[57:15] the body and there is a reward for every
[57:19] work you do for the
[57:22] Lord you know you know you maybe sing a
[57:24] song or maybe pray where no one even
[57:28] sees
[57:30] you and you pray for the
[57:32] ministry or maybe you know you you play
[57:35] music musical instruments or maybe you
[57:38] interpre or or maybe you know you say
[57:42] Amen in the church do you even know that
[57:45] to say Amen in the
[57:47] church is
[57:49] ministering you're ministering to
[57:51] someone
[57:52] else you know or when someone is dozing
[57:55] and he you say Amen
[57:58] oh yeah I should also say Amen next time
[58:01] and then they will be attentive to hear
[58:03] then will say Amen but if you sit next
[58:06] to someone who is
[58:08] dozing you realize you're also dozing
[58:10] like
[58:11] them because they are ministering to
[58:16] you praise the name of the Lord we don't
[58:19] want to minister to each other like
[58:21] that we want to influence each other the
[58:24] right way
[58:28] amen amen even shouting and Clapping
[58:31] Your Hands singing you know enjoying the
[58:35] word you know it's
[58:38] ministering going out passing a
[58:42] tra Minister you see say all Ministry
[58:46] let us wait on our
[58:49] ministry by the way this is the best job
[58:52] that you can ever do
[58:56] Jesus Christ hired all his
[59:02] followers all the followers of Jesus are
[59:06] hired and they hired by Jesus and they
[59:10] are paid by
[59:11] Jesus hallelujah amen and I am hired by
[59:16] him and let me tell you you can never
[59:18] serve him and he doesn't reward
[59:22] you you may be the one moving the
[59:24] cameras and do the sound or whatever it
[59:28] is let me tell you you are hired by
[59:31] him and the way he pays you is not the
[59:33] way man pays
[59:36] you man May pay you one
[59:39] million but one million cannot give you
[59:42] oxygen for one
[59:44] year but you see someone who is earning
[59:47] 1
[59:48] million and not serving the lord may be
[59:51] sick each
[59:53] time and when they have to go and check
[59:56] how much they spend on the hospital
[59:59] bills it's quite a lot but you you are
[1:00:03] healthy
[1:00:05] you you are hired by
[1:00:08] Jesus we should learn to appreciate
[1:00:10] Jesus
[1:00:12] Christ as long as we are serving him he
[1:00:16] pays us he promised to pay us and he
[1:00:19] promised to give us 100
[1:00:21] here and 100 over there so in other
[1:00:25] words whatever we enjoying here on
[1:00:28] Earth is just the
[1:00:31] beginning of our
[1:00:33] payments there is much more coming in
[1:00:36] heaven we shall be paid in
[1:00:38] heaven we shall be rewarded with much
[1:00:42] more much more than what manone can
[1:00:46] give much more than what man can
[1:00:49] give that's why brother sister even come
[1:00:52] to churches serving God
[1:00:56] yes it is oh he that teaches let him
[1:00:59] wait on
[1:01:01] teaching he that exal on
[1:01:04] exaltation he that he that give let him
[1:01:08] do it with
[1:01:10] Simplicity did you know even giving is a
[1:01:16] gift praise the name of the Lord give
[1:01:19] with
[1:01:21] Simplicity don't complicate things don't
[1:01:24] first go on cam to give
[1:01:27] give with
[1:01:29] Simplicity he that
[1:01:31] ruleth with
[1:01:33] diligence he that show Mercy with
[1:01:37] cheerfulness and so we see there's many
[1:01:40] kinds of
[1:01:41] Ministries but tonight I want to look at
[1:01:45] um and I hope tonight I I'll put this to
[1:01:46] a
[1:01:48] close the three-fold quality of a true
[1:01:51] Ministry
[1:01:56] how do you know that your ministry or
[1:01:58] someone's Ministry is of
[1:02:02] God how do you know if you in a true
[1:02:05] church
[1:02:08] ministry or you're following the right
[1:02:11] teaching how do you know how do you um
[1:02:14] weigh the kind of ministry you are
[1:02:19] under or the kind of ministry that you
[1:02:23] have so this goes from the of the
[1:02:26] ministry as a
[1:02:29] church to the ministry that you have as
[1:02:31] an
[1:02:33] individual and then to whether you are
[1:02:35] following the right
[1:02:38] Ministry and so I'm I'm going to answer
[1:02:41] this um by reading from the church ede
[1:02:46] book and a very very interesting fact
[1:02:50] here in the Ephesian Church age Paul
[1:02:54] founded the church at Ephesus
[1:02:57] about the middle of the first
[1:03:00] century this enables us to set the date
[1:03:03] of the beginning of the Ephesian
[1:03:08] Church
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:11] 3 Paul's manner of ministering set the
[1:03:14] pattern that all future Messengers were
[1:03:17] to Aspire
[1:03:23] to and actually sets the pattern for
[1:03:26] every true minister of
[1:03:31] God you see we have a generation
[1:03:36] age some of you who know we are living
[1:03:39] in the seventh
[1:03:41] age and um you know there have been
[1:03:44] other six ages before
[1:03:47] us how can we
[1:03:50] know the kind of ministry that God used
[1:03:53] in every one of these Generations
[1:04:00] how can we know that it is um Paul that
[1:04:03] he used
[1:04:05] in well the Bible tells us is
[1:04:08] Paul because he said he was the Apostle
[1:04:11] to the
[1:04:12] Gentiles and so from this we understand
[1:04:15] and brother bam says here Paul set the
[1:04:20] pattern his kind of ministry the kind of
[1:04:22] ministry he
[1:04:24] had it set the pattern for every other
[1:04:28] messenger that
[1:04:30] came now we can say the second Church
[1:04:35] age we will know what kind of messenger
[1:04:38] it
[1:04:40] will the Third Church age pegamos will
[1:04:44] know what kind of messenger they will
[1:04:47] have the fourth Church age
[1:04:50] theth all of them up to the last one we
[1:04:54] can be able to not surely God used that
[1:04:56] man in that
[1:04:58] generation to some of you who don't know
[1:05:01] there are seven gentle
[1:05:05] ages and in each age God uses one
[1:05:10] man you had me WR one
[1:05:13] man one man called a
[1:05:17] messenger and it is his
[1:05:20] revelation of the
[1:05:22] word that all others of that age will
[1:05:25] Feist
[1:05:28] from if you doubt what I just said you
[1:05:31] can check in the Book of
[1:05:33] Revelation chapter one chapter 2 chapter
[1:05:37] 3 there are seven distinct Church
[1:05:40] agents we know there is one
[1:05:43] Church of Jesus Christ but you see there
[1:05:46] were the
[1:05:47] Jews but when the Jews were
[1:05:50] C according to Romans
[1:05:53] 11 they were C when were they cut off
[1:05:58] Romans chapter I mean Acts chapter
[1:06:01] 8 that's where we see they began
[1:06:04] blasing and refusing what the disciples
[1:06:07] were
[1:06:08] saying and from that day the disciples
[1:06:11] looked at them and they said because you
[1:06:14] are rejecting the
[1:06:16] world from today we turn to the
[1:06:21] Gentiles so from that time the message
[1:06:23] has come to the Gentiles
[1:06:27] and the Gentiles are the rest of the
[1:06:30] world apart from
[1:06:34] Israel but you see the Gentiles have
[1:06:37] what we call a
[1:06:40] dispensation a period of
[1:06:44] time after
[1:06:46] which God will now leave them and go
[1:06:49] back to the
[1:06:52] Jews but you see that the the the the
[1:06:57] dispensation is a dispensation of seven
[1:07:00] gentle Church
[1:07:06] ages and the Bible is very
[1:07:09] clear in the Book of
[1:07:12] Revelation he calls them
[1:07:16] candlesticks and you see he said the
[1:07:19] candlesticks because when when John was
[1:07:21] in a vision he
[1:07:24] saw and voice told him the candlesticks
[1:07:26] you are
[1:07:28] seeing are seven
[1:07:31] churches but we understand Jesus has one
[1:07:34] church so there this is not just seven
[1:07:37] churches but it means seven generations
[1:07:40] of the same
[1:07:45] church and from
[1:07:50] ephes
[1:07:52] Philadelphia up toia
[1:07:55] we are living in the last
[1:07:57] one but Paul did I mean John did not
[1:08:00] only seek
[1:08:02] candlesticks he also saw
[1:08:05] stars seven
[1:08:08] stars and and the voice told him you
[1:08:11] know those Seven
[1:08:14] Stars you know are
[1:08:17] angels to the seven
[1:08:20] churches what does the word angel
[1:08:24] mean means
[1:08:27] messenger an angel is a
[1:08:31] messenger a a prophet a messenger so now
[1:08:35] these seven
[1:08:36] churches had seven
[1:08:39] Messengers praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:42] and that's how we are able to know that
[1:08:45] the Gentiles have a period of seven
[1:08:50] churches and seven
[1:08:53] Messengers and how are we able to those
[1:08:55] seven
[1:08:57] Messengers we can only find a
[1:09:01] pattern that the first one operated
[1:09:06] in and then we can be able to say ahuh
[1:09:09] the rest of them are all going to follow
[1:09:11] the same
[1:09:15] patter they're going to follow the same
[1:09:17] manner of
[1:09:21] ministry then we can be able to say that
[1:09:24] is the is the message
[1:09:27] that is the messenger that is the
[1:09:29] messenger praise the name of the Lord
[1:09:32] there are three things or three
[1:09:36] qualities that we can be able to look
[1:09:39] up and say these are the
[1:09:43] qualities that every Messenger will
[1:09:47] have because it's what Paul had in the
[1:09:51] beginning now not for only the
[1:09:53] generations
[1:09:55] also the
[1:09:56] preachers the individual
[1:09:59] ministers how can you know someone is a
[1:10:02] true
[1:10:03] minister they must flow in the same
[1:10:08] pattern how can you know a church
[1:10:10] ministry is the right
[1:10:13] one it should flow in the same
[1:10:17] pattern praise the name of the Lord and
[1:10:20] so the first
[1:10:22] one Paul was absolutely true to the
[1:10:28] word he never deviated from it no matter
[1:10:32] what the
[1:10:35] costul stayed with the
[1:10:38] word and by the way the word was not did
[1:10:41] not come from
[1:10:44] Paul the word came from Jesus
[1:10:47] Christ that even Paul himself could not
[1:10:51] change he could not alter
[1:10:55] a letter of that
[1:10:58] word did you know Paul preached that
[1:11:00] women should not be
[1:11:04] pastors Paul preached one
[1:11:06] God Paul preached husband should love
[1:11:09] their
[1:11:11] wives Paul preached women should submit
[1:11:13] themselves to their
[1:11:15] husbands Paul preached if tongues are
[1:11:18] spoken in church it should be
[1:11:21] interpreted PA preached baptism
[1:11:25] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:11:28] much water Paul preached amen baptism of
[1:11:32] the Holy Ghost that everyone who
[1:11:35] believes must be filled with the Holy
[1:11:39] Ghost Paul preached the serpent
[1:11:43] SE and someone came to me last time I
[1:11:45] said why is that in the
[1:11:48] Bible because if our messenger
[1:11:52] today Willam Bram is our Time s
[1:11:58] messenger if he is the
[1:12:01] one how can we
[1:12:03] know we can know according to the first
[1:12:08] pattern he should walk and operate in
[1:12:11] the pattern of
[1:12:15] Paul should teach what
[1:12:18] PA if he deviates from it then we run
[1:12:22] away we know he's not the one
[1:12:25] so William Bram never brought any new
[1:12:29] idea come on church he never started a
[1:12:34] new no he took us back again to what
[1:12:38] Paul
[1:12:40] told Hallelujah and every true
[1:12:44] Messenger should take us back again and
[1:12:48] every preure
[1:12:49] today no matter how many people he
[1:12:53] has if he doesn't take us back to the
[1:12:57] foundations then we know it's not true
[1:12:59] to the
[1:13:00] world what Paul tau is the
[1:13:04] word it cannot be
[1:13:07] altered it cannot be changed it cannot
[1:13:10] be reduced it cannot be added on no
[1:13:14] matter how much we
[1:13:16] try the word of God Will Remain the word
[1:13:18] of
[1:13:20] God because the Bible says the word of
[1:13:23] God is forever set in heaven
[1:13:26] when God gives his
[1:13:28] word his first thought was
[1:13:32] perfect he can't change
[1:13:35] it and so all the messengers of
[1:13:38] God when they come they'll preach
[1:13:41] nothing new they'll preach the same
[1:13:45] thing that God had said in the
[1:13:48] beginning praise the name of the Lord in
[1:13:51] Galatians
[1:13:53] 1:8 Paul spoke to the
[1:13:55] Gan and he told them these words but
[1:13:58] though we are an
[1:14:01] angel from heaven even if it is
[1:14:05] us we the
[1:14:07] disciples or an angel comes
[1:14:10] flying and he comes from Heaven if he
[1:14:13] preach any other
[1:14:16] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:14:20] preached unto
[1:14:21] you let him be a cast
[1:14:26] now Paul had the audacity to say these
[1:14:31] words because he knew what he said was
[1:14:35] not his
[1:14:37] ideas what he said was God
[1:14:41] speaking it cannot be
[1:14:44] altered not by Paul not by a preacher
[1:14:48] not by even an
[1:14:50] angel so now we can be able to see the
[1:14:53] false ch ches
[1:14:56] if they come and tell us we should pray
[1:14:58] through a
[1:15:01] woman Mar or whatever it
[1:15:04] is then we will search it in the
[1:15:07] teachings of
[1:15:08] Paul we won't find it there then we
[1:15:12] shall tell them you are
[1:15:15] Liars when they tell us that pastor's
[1:15:19] wife should also be a
[1:15:21] pastor she should also be a Bible
[1:15:24] teacher
[1:15:25] we shall go in the teachings of
[1:15:28] Paul where is it if you don't find it
[1:15:32] there no matter how many people
[1:15:34] following that
[1:15:35] church no matter how many manifestations
[1:15:38] that Ministry
[1:15:40] has we shall not follow it because we
[1:15:44] will not their
[1:15:45] allar no matter how good they
[1:15:49] speak but if their
[1:15:51] Ministry that doesn't believe in the
[1:15:53] baptism of the Holy
[1:15:57] then we not the
[1:15:58] allar because we're going to see here
[1:16:01] things that were in the ministry of
[1:16:05] Paul they believed the
[1:16:07] word they believe the word
[1:16:10] church Hallelujah he said let anybody be
[1:16:14] a
[1:16:15] curse if he comes and preaches another
[1:16:19] gospel all right I'm so glad that we are
[1:16:22] preaching the same old gospel Paul
[1:16:26] the same Gospel of Jesus
[1:16:29] Christ and so and
[1:16:32] here well I would want to read a lot but
[1:16:35] uh let me just continue here because of
[1:16:37] time I had other scriptures to give you
[1:16:39] to confirm that but that's all right he
[1:16:41] says notice that Paul was
[1:16:45] unorganized but Spirit
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:49] Le someone Paul was
[1:16:52] unorganized Spirit l
[1:16:56] don't fear your neighbor tell them was
[1:16:59] SP
[1:17:03] Hallelujah
[1:17:05] spirit and every true
[1:17:07] minister is
[1:17:10] Spirit every
[1:17:12] messenger who are Spirit Le we don't
[1:17:15] believe in being led by an
[1:17:19] organization we believe in being led by
[1:17:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:17:25] Pastor should be led by the Holy Ghost
[1:17:28] there is no system that leads
[1:17:30] us but there is only one thing that
[1:17:32] leads
[1:17:33] us the old
[1:17:37] time hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:17:40] Jerusalem Jerusalem's councel never sent
[1:17:43] Paul
[1:17:46] out nor did it have any
[1:17:49] power all jurisdiction over
[1:17:53] him imagine tomorrow someone coming
[1:17:55] saying that they are firing
[1:17:59] me let me tell you Church a true God
[1:18:02] called
[1:18:03] preacher cannot be hired and cannot be
[1:18:08] fired did you hear what I just said we
[1:18:11] are not
[1:18:13] hirings we are hired by

[1:18:29] man we cannot be fired by
[1:18:32] organization hallelujah amen that's why
[1:18:35] it should come
[1:18:37] down from the age to the churches to the
[1:18:43] pastors then even to the gifts and the
[1:18:46] callings in the
[1:18:49] body I play the piano because I'm called

[1:19:17] say the same same
[1:19:21] thing praise
[1:19:23] God God Alone did the
[1:19:27] sending and the
[1:19:29] leading Paul was not of
[1:19:32] men but of
[1:19:34] God that's why we are not a
[1:19:38] denomination denominations send
[1:19:42] you and brother said if the denomination
[1:19:46] sent
[1:19:47] you let it take care of you but if God
[1:19:51] sent
[1:19:52] you let him take care of you
[1:19:55] hallelujah amen when I went to
[1:19:58] Ethiopia with my young
[1:20:01] wife we were just newly
[1:20:04] married we were basically really
[1:20:06] literally
[1:20:08] children but God sent us
[1:20:11] there there was there came a time when
[1:20:14] we did not know how we shall make ends
[1:20:18] meat but God was moving things were
[1:20:22] happening people were getting saved
[1:20:25] and we didn't know how and where we
[1:20:27] shall get money
[1:20:29] from but then one Edis had the
[1:20:34] testimony of what God is
[1:20:37] doing and he wrote me an email one time
[1:20:40] he said brother I want you to understand
[1:20:43] we are going to be behind you
[1:20:46] 100% And we are going to support
[1:20:49] that a man from
[1:20:52] Canada never met me before

[1:21:27] send
[1:21:28] you no we are Spirit
[1:21:32] La hallelujah amen Paul was not of
[1:21:38] men but of
[1:21:41] God hallelujah and here Paul writes in
[1:21:44] Galatians
[1:21:46] 1:1 Paul an
[1:21:48] apostle today if someone says I am an
[1:21:53] apost still
[1:21:57] and Paul call himself an
[1:21:59] apostle Paul an
[1:22:01] apostle not of
[1:22:04] men neither by man but by Jesus
[1:22:09] Christ and God the Father who raised him
[1:22:13] from the
[1:22:14] dead praise the name of the Lord and in
[1:22:17] Galatians 235 says but neither Titus who
[1:22:21] was with me being a Greek was compelled
[1:22:24] to be
[1:22:29] circumcised and that because of false
[1:22:31] Brethren una AWS brought
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:35] in who came in
[1:22:38] prively to spy they came in privately to
[1:22:41] spy out our Liberty which we have in
[1:22:44] Christ
[1:22:47] Jesus that they might bring us into
[1:22:51] bondage to whom he gave place by
[1:22:56] subjection to
[1:22:59] whom we gave place by
[1:23:02] subjection no not for for an
[1:23:10] hour some people came
[1:23:13] in and they came in

[1:23:20] Christ by the way do you know the
[1:23:22] Liberty we have

[1:23:34] umbrella of Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ they tell you ask who is your
[1:23:40] Archbishop tell Bishop is Jesus
[1:23:44] Christ what is your
[1:23:46] denomination we have
[1:23:51] believer you have so much Liberty
[1:23:54] come under our
[1:23:56] umbrella Paul said they want this man
[1:23:59] wanted to put him in under
[1:24:02] bondage to whom they gave no they said
[1:24:06] they gave no they give place they says
[1:24:08] to whom they never give place to subject
[1:24:12] themselves under
[1:24:15] them no not for an
[1:24:19] hour we as Believers of this
[1:24:22] message cannot even under these
[1:24:25] umbrellas you are
[1:24:36] hearing world of
[1:24:40] churches we
[1:24:42] cannot we we cannot
[1:24:45] submit not for an hour not for half an
[1:24:48] hour not for a minute because we have
[1:24:52] Liberty
[1:24:54] we are set free from
[1:24:58] denominationalism how do you operate I
[1:25:00] say we operate by the power of the Holy
[1:25:05] Spirit how are you able to be
[1:25:08] controlled how do you control your
[1:25:11] Min the word and the holy
[1:25:15] ghost that is how the first church
[1:25:18] was that's how the church today should
[1:25:22] be amen what is your
[1:25:25] religion we are just
[1:25:29] Christians praise the name of the Lord
[1:25:32] how many are you in the world we don't
[1:25:35] know also but all we know there are
[1:25:39] people almost
[1:25:40] everywhere whose hearts are all on
[1:25:44] fire they are all baptized in Jesus
[1:25:47] name filled with the Holy
[1:25:50] Ghost who are
[1:25:52] you we are following of Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ we are almost in every
[1:25:58] corner let me tell you Believers of this
[1:26:02] message are in every
[1:26:04] corner all over the
[1:26:07] world all over the world all over the
[1:26:10] world they believe this message and it's
[1:26:13] not only in our
[1:26:15] generation it has been even the
[1:26:17] generations before
[1:26:21] us that the truth of the Gospel
[1:26:25] might continue with
[1:26:26] you with denomination the truth of the
[1:26:29] Gospel cannot
[1:26:32] continue because you have to understand
[1:26:34] denomination separates
[1:26:39] Brotherhood denomination removes
[1:26:42] Fellowship that's why here always we
[1:26:45] say we have no law but
[1:26:48] love no book but the
[1:26:51] Bible no Creed but Christ
[1:26:55] no
[1:26:56] membership but
[1:26:58] fellowship and the blood of
[1:27:00] Jesus worship and cleanses
[1:27:03] us from all
[1:27:06] sin secondly his ministry was in the
[1:27:10] power of the
[1:27:13] spirit that's another type the first way
[1:27:17] we see a true
[1:27:19] Ministry it will not be a
[1:27:21] denomination it will not operate like
[1:27:25] denomination it will be word
[1:27:29] best as long as the Bible says it
[1:27:33] that and I'm so glad that we are one of
[1:27:37] those our ministry is word
[1:27:42] best hallelujah hallelujah it's not
[1:27:45] about the man William
[1:27:48] Bram the man PA
[1:27:54] the
[1:27:55] word and the man Jesus
[1:27:58] Christ and secondly his ministry was in
[1:28:02] the
[1:28:04] power of the
[1:28:07] spirit oh hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah
[1:28:12] Hallelujah Hallelujah the power of the
[1:28:16] spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken
[1:28:19] and written work
[1:28:25] hallelujah amen you see how you able to
[1:28:28] understand a true
[1:28:29] Ministry it's not only because they are
[1:28:32] preaching the word
[1:28:34] correctly there should also be the
[1:28:37] demonstration of the power of
[1:28:40] demonstration of the
[1:28:42] word the demonstration of the spoken and
[1:28:45] written
[1:28:48] word yes there should be the power of
[1:28:50] the spirit
[1:28:54] his ministry was in the power of the
[1:28:58] spirit in First Corinthians 2 he said
[1:29:02] and I Brethren when I came to
[1:29:04] you I did not come with Excellence of
[1:29:09] speech of wisdom declaring unto you the
[1:29:12] testimony of
[1:29:14] God for I determin not to know anything
[1:29:17] among
[1:29:20] you save Jesus Christ and him crucified
[1:29:25] and I and I was with you in
[1:29:28] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:29:30] trembling and my speech and my
[1:29:34] preaching was not inspirational
[1:29:37] preaching was not just inspirational
[1:29:39] preaching
[1:29:42] other
[1:29:44] just it was not with enticing
[1:29:47] words of man's Wisdom but in a
[1:29:51] demonstration
[1:29:54] of the
[1:29:55] spirit and
[1:29:57] power
[1:29:59] hallelujah amen that your faith should
[1:30:03] not stand in the wisdom of
[1:30:07] men but in the power of God and I say
[1:30:11] wherever I have preached this
[1:30:14] message I have seen
[1:30:17] demonstration of the spirit and
[1:30:20] power Hallelujah when God sent William
[1:30:23] Bram
[1:30:25] did not just come with teachings and
[1:30:29] doctrines there was
[1:30:32] demonstration there was power there was
[1:30:35] the spirit coming behind those
[1:30:39] words talk about a
[1:30:42] prophet they would stand and
[1:30:44] say if what I have preached is the
[1:30:49] truth let the god of the
[1:30:51] Bible the god I've been talking about
[1:30:54] let him come
[1:30:56] forth Hallelujah and everything goes
[1:31:00] quiet everything
[1:31:02] goes and then he begins to call out
[1:31:05] names of
[1:31:07] people sick people he calls them by name
[1:31:12] and he says who did you
[1:31:14] touch you never touched me but you
[1:31:17] touched
[1:31:20] him he he he says what was that that was
[1:31:24] not me I don't know you have never seen
[1:31:26] you that was
[1:31:29] God the god of the Bible lifting him out
[1:31:32] of
[1:31:34] History the
[1:31:36] Supernatural and this message is
[1:31:39] one the problem many Believers are
[1:31:42] becoming
[1:31:46] intellectuals where they no longer
[1:31:48] believe in the Supernatural
[1:31:51] power but brother this word is
[1:31:55] power it is
[1:31:58] power hallelujah amen I've seen sick men
[1:32:03] healed I have seen people vomit
[1:32:08] witchcraft just by the preaching of this
[1:32:11] message I have seen the sick
[1:32:14] healed come on what are we talking about
[1:32:17] we talking about the power of the
[1:32:20] word if only we can come and open our
[1:32:23] heart
[1:32:25] I've seen Sinners get
[1:32:28] saved I've seen
[1:32:30] fornicators being sh being filled with
[1:32:33] the Holy
[1:32:34] Ghost I've seen Sinners becoming
[1:32:39] Preachers by the power of this message
[1:32:42] because Jesus is
[1:32:44] power is not only words words words
[1:32:48] words I don't even need to preach and
[1:32:50] pray over you
[1:32:54] let me tell you you need to understand
[1:32:57] the difference between this
[1:32:59] message and the Pentecostal
[1:33:02] denominations is that they do
[1:33:05] it but here Jesus does it to confirm
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:16] theallu churches we don't look for man
[1:33:19] of God man of God man of
[1:33:22] God churches are not about man of
[1:33:26] God our churches are about God of the
[1:33:32] world Amen Hallelujah sir where you
[1:33:35] preach the Bible says I sent my
[1:33:38] word and my word healed
[1:33:42] them my word
[1:33:44] delivered if you come to church with an
[1:33:47] open
[1:33:48] mind let me tell you Church it doesn't
[1:33:51] matter which situation you are in
[1:33:54] you may be loed down in
[1:33:56] ha if you open your heart by the hearing
[1:34:00] of these
[1:34:01] words it sets you free it sends Demons
[1:34:05] back
[1:34:07] in it delivers
[1:34:09] you that's what the power of the word
[1:34:11] can
[1:34:13] do and Paul heard
[1:34:16] that the dead were
[1:34:18] raised Paul one time was
[1:34:20] preaching and and and a man called
[1:34:25] he was
[1:34:27] doing but he was in the
[1:34:31] presence and he fell down and died but
[1:34:36] talk about the power of the
[1:34:38] world when he died Paul went there he on
[1:34:43] the young man and he told him come on
[1:34:46] get up he told them the younger boy is
[1:34:50] not dead he is sleeping
[1:34:57] and do you know why he died because he
[1:34:59] was dozing do you know why he was doing
[1:35:03] because Paul was preaching for so
[1:35:06] long no wonder we preach for long in our
[1:35:09] Mage
[1:35:11] church because the true message is being
[1:35:14] followed by that
[1:35:16] thing we don't sing for 4 hours and
[1:35:19] preach for 30 minutes
[1:35:24] it is the word that
